1
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,019
Jung Eun, I'm almost finished, so call everyone.

2
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,621
- Use the new signal we created. - Okay.

3
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,528
It's time for lunch.

4
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:32,815
It is. Hold on. What's today's menu?

5
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,604
Stir-fried spicy pork. It's stir-fried spicy pork!

6
00:00:49,779 --> 00:00:52,519
Gosh, it really is stir-fried spicy pork.

7
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,388
It's so comfortable with the alphorn. Don't you think?

8
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,719
I know. Jung Eun,

9
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,627
you've become useful around here for a change.

10
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,729
What? Do you want to die?

11
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,260
You're being violent again.

12
00:01:02,599 --> 00:01:04,558
You said you'd live nicely from now on.

13
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,898
You brought this upon yourself, so just accept it.

14
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:08,068
Brought what upon myself?

15
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:09,294
You don't have to know.

16
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,888
Eat up. You know today is cleaning day, right?

17
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,750
I have plans with my college club tonight, so I have to go.

18
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,739
It's the super strength club of Huam University.

19
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:21,549
Really? Aren't you just lying because you don't want to clean?

20
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,774
I'm not lying.

21
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,674
It's our first gathering since we graduated, so I must go.

22
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,502
I'm sure everyone probably changed a lot.

23
00:01:33,489 --> 00:01:35,389
Wait. Why are you two coming in together?

24
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,889
I bumped into her on the way home.

25
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,182
Really?

26
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,598
You didn't eat lunch, right? Have a seat.

27
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:43,323
No, we had hotteok on the way here, so we're not hungry.

28
00:01:43,699 --> 00:01:45,198
Isn't it time for the show?

29
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:46,669
- Yes. - I'll help you monitor it.

30
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,792
Get changed and come back out.

31
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:49,132
Okay.

32
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,437
Enjoy your meal then.

33
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,940
What was that?

34
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,088
Are you sure he's heartbroken?

35
00:01:59,089 --> 00:02:01,089
He's so cool about it.

36
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,588
That's the American style.

37
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,415
I'm relieved. Let's eat our lunch.

38
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:29,119
I'm sure this is the place.

39
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,445
Jun Ki, over here.

40
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:32,569
Hang on.

41
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:37,559
Are you... Dong Chul? You're Dong Chul, right?

42
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,019
Yes, it's me.

43
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,328
Why are you so late?

44
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:42,707
I was stuck in traffic.

45
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,328
Where is everyone else?

46
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:45,668
They're all running late.

47
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:49,239
Gosh, nothing has changed with everyone being tardy.

48
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,660
Here, have some chicken.

49
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,809
Hey, Jun Ki. How long has it been?

50
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,238
Long time no see.

51
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:59,379
Right, you're Byeong Soo, aren't you?

52
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,470
No, I'm not.

53
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,759
- Who are you? - You don't know me?

54
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,978
We were eating ramyeon at our club practice room...

55
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:07,619
and set the place on fire, and we burned our eyebrows.

56
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,414
Right! Our eyebrows! I remember now.

57
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:13,189
What was your name?

58
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,995
What? You don't remember my name?

59
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,999
How could you be like this?

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,358
This is so upsetting.

61
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:21,563
No, hold on. Hey, I'm sorry.

62
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,247
What was his name?

63
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,160
I recognize their faces, but I can't remember their names.

64
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:38,518
I felt so sorry to that guy.

65
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,119
This is so awkward.

66
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,984
I better take off early.

67
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,352
You're Jun Ki, aren't you?

68
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,581
Who is this dude?

69
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,738
I can't even remember his face.

70
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:52,226
Don't you remember me?

71
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,206
Hey, it's me!

72
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:58,007
I don't know. I don't know who you are!

73
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:01,985
He'll be upset if I say I don't remember him.

74
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,379
Of course I know.

75
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,978
I remember clearly.

76
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:10,219
How long has it been? How have you been doing?

77
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,851
I've been doing well.

78
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,554
- How about you? - Me too.

79
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,659
By the way, you've changed a lot.

80
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,914
You became more handsome.

81
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,510
Really?

82
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,569
You became more handsome too.

83
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,864
Hey, let's get back there for a drink.

84
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:29,768
But something urgent came up, so I have to go.

85
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,789
Really?

86
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,827
Then let's have a drink next time. You know my number, right?

87
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,539
Yes, of course I know your number.

88
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,804
Okay, good.

89
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,948
I know your number too, so I'll call you soon.

90
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:41,969
Okay.

91
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,619
I'll get going then.

92
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,150
Okay, my friend.

93
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,530
Who are you?

94
00:04:53,529 --> 00:04:57,202
What on earth is your name?

95
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:02,354
(What's Your Name?)

96
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,236
Did you have fun with your friends last night?

97
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,568
Not at all.

98
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:09,068
I couldn't even remember their names, and I felt so sorry.

99
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:10,109
What?

100
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,179
It hasn't been long since you graduated. How could you forget?

101
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,424
I told you to cut back on your drinking.

102
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,058
That's alcoholic infringement.

103
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:20,948
Gosh, seriously.

104
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:23,163
It's not infringement, it's alcoholic "dementia".

105
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:26,237
- I'll be more careful. - Right, it's your fault.

106
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,180
Goodness.

107
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,850
Hello?

108
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,499
Hey, what's up?

109
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,713
Really? Okay, I'll be there soon.

110
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,968
- I'm heading out. - Where are you going?

111
00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:41,285
My friend wants to meet me to talk about a job opportunity.

112
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:42,561
I'll see you later.

113
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,371
- See you later. - Okay.

114
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:50,119
I hope Ki Bong finds a job soon. I'm worried.

115
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,201
I know.

116
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,943
Brother. What's that in your hand?

117
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,067
It's coffee. I'm going to start working on my song again.

118
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,328
I'll need coffee for that.

119
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:01,588
Work on your song?

120
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:04,720
I've been neglecting my work recently.

121
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,987
I should try to write a good song for my comeback.

122
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,294
You thought well.

123
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:13,115
You all know how cranky I get when I'm writing songs, right?

124
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,309
I ask of you to keep out of my studio...

125
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,973
and keep it down.

126
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:18,501
Especially you.

127
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,401
All right.

128
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,449
- I'll get going. - Okay.

129
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:26,942
Good luck!

130
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,161
I guess he's trying to pull himself together.

131
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:32,279
I guess. I thought he'd have a hard time.

132
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:34,180
It's a relief.

133
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:49,054
Let's forget about Soo Yeon...

134
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,616
and write up a masterpiece.

135
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,049
(The Leader of Global Marketing, Global Network Marketing Yutnori)

136
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,467
"Global Network Marketing Yutnori"?

137
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,788
Your company has such a unique name.

138
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:03,531
You said you had something work-related to talk about?

139
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:05,412
The thing is...

140
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,229
Ki Bong, do you know about the disadvantages...

141
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,952
we experience every day because of retail margin?

142
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:13,707
- What's that? - What?

143
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:16,575
- You don't know retail margin? - No.

144
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,268
I've never heard of it in my life.

145
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,408
Is that so?

146
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:23,739
That's all right. It's possible.

147
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,679
I didn't know about it, either. Retail margin is...

148
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,363
When a factory makes a product that's 10 cents,

149
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,386
before it reaches your hands,

150
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:33,397
it goes through the wholesaler, the retailer,

151
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,518
and with advertising fees added as well, the price snowballs.

152
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,989
So in the end, you buy the same product...

153
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,560
for 30, 40, or even 50 cents!

154
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,004
The fees that are added in the process...

155
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,961
is what we call "retail margin".

156
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,068
But what if you could reduce this retail margin...

157
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,099
and buy products at a lower price?

158
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,905
- It would be nice, I guess. - Right?

159
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:56,585
That's what our company is doing.

160
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,230
Some people see it as illegal pyramid selling and so on,

161
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,018
but that's only because they're uneducated.

162
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,748
You're doing a good deed.

163
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,318
Would you like to try working here?

164
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,442
What?

165
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,693
You're going to hire me?

166
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,545
What's my job?

167
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,686
Global Network Marketing Yutnori runs on a membership system.

168
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:29,879
It is divided into 5 levels, "Do", "Ge", "Geol", "Yut", and "Mo".

169
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,063
"Do", "Ge", "Geol", "Yut", and "Mo"?

170
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,148
That's why the company's name is Yutnori!

171
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:36,087
Exactly! Look over here.

172
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,119
As you can see, I am a Yut...

173
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,230
and he is a Geol.

174
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,677
I see.

175
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,810
How much will my salary be?

176
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,158
You won't be getting a salary.

177
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,720
- What? - You get an incentive, instead.

178
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:50,636
- An incentive? - For example,

179
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,869
if you set up on our products with somebody...

180
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,705
and they buy it,

181
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:58,759
we pay you an incentive.

182
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,420
I get payed just by introducing it to them?

183
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,368
- Why? - You helped us sell it to them,

184
00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:06,776
so we're thanking you!

185
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,123
To thank me?

186
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,145
- Why? - Sorry?

187
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,688
That's because in our perspective,

188
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:17,443
we raised a profit thanks to you.

189
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:21,798
But that's not it.

190
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,959
If that person introduces our product...

191
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,805
to another person,

192
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:30,744
part of that profit will come to you.

193
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:34,136
What? But that person doesn't know me.

194
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,308
And I'll get paid for that...

195
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,871
even if I didn't do anything?

196
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:39,733
- Why? - What?

197
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:43,094
Well,

198
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:47,526
the company did raise a profit in the end, thanks to you.

199
00:09:48,049 --> 00:09:50,641
Still, it's just not right to receive someone else's pay...

200
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:53,036
- without doing anything. - Sorry?

201
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,802
I'm not someone who doesn't know what's right from wrong.

202
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,919
I can't work like this.

203
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:05,894
How long do I have to keep passing out my resume like this?

204
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:09,488
Be careful, will you?

205
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,864
- I'm sorry, sir. - Jun Ki?

206
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,030
Who is he?

207
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:16,979
Oh, the guy from the restroom!

208
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,515
- What are you doing here? - What?

209
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,959
I came to submit my resume.

210
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,113
Your resume?

211
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,995
Are you an actor, then?

212
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,834
Well, I'm only playing minor roles, but...

213
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,129
You should have said so earlier!

214
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,428
I work at Garmarvel Pictures.

215
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:34,899
- Really? - Yes.

216
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:37,344
I would've helped you if I knew earlier.

217
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:40,599
Wait a minute, Jun Ki. Why don't we go get a drink?

218
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,762
And talk about work.

219
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,977
Sure... Friend!

220
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:50,714
We're getting ready to shoot a new movie by Director Park Chan Wook.

221
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:52,710
- Director Park? - Yes.

222
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:54,249
I was just on my way from the meeting.

223
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,605
- Would you like to meet him? - What?

224
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:01,242
Of course! I'd appreciate it.

225
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:02,811
All right, then.

226
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,918
I'll try to set you up, soon.

227
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:07,969
Here, let's drink up.

228
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,805
Sure... Friend!

229
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:11,262
Cheers.

230
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,894
How long do I have to keep calling him "friend"?

231
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:17,839
It's driving me crazy!

232
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,891
I need to figure out his name in order to get his number...

233
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,361
and get help from him.

234
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,279
Can I have your business card?

235
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,429
My business card? Wait.

236
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,213
My business card is...

237
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:36,682
I ran out.

238
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:40,099
But why would we need to exchange business cards?

239
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,925
You're right. We're too close.

240
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,186
I don't know, I don't!

241
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:48,921
I don't know your name!

242
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,265
Should I just ask him?

243
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,432
No, I shouldn't.

244
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,890
What if he gets offended?

245
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,940
What do I do?

246
00:11:58,049 --> 00:11:59,069
Hello?

247
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:01,394
I'm calling for the reservation I made a while ago.

248
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,844
Here you go.

249
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,387
Yes. 3pm tomorrow.

250
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:07,212
My name?

251
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,752
My name is...

252
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,483
Park...

253
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:12,123
Come on!

254
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,871
I missed it!

255
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,022
Why did you have to sneeze just now?

256
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:19,598
No, that's not right.

257
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,191
It's Park...

258
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:24,178
Oh, come on!

259
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:26,908
- I'm sorry. I'll go get new plates. - Thank you.

260
00:12:26,909 --> 00:12:28,306
My gosh.

261
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,383
Jun Ki. What's wrong?

262
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,048
What? I...

263
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,793
I was just wondering if she got hurt.

264
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:36,812
Are you all right?

265
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,954
Yes, I'm all right.

266
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,451
Gosh.

267
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,737
It was my only chance to get his name.

268
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,877
Whatever. I got his last name.

269
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,629
He's Park. Park!

270
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,452
Friend, I need to use the restroom.

271
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:57,021
Hello? Jae Won?

272
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,432
It's me, Jun Ki.

273
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,249
Do you know anyone from our club...

274
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,882
who works at Garmarvel Pictures?

275
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,473
You don't?

276
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,449
Then could you send me a list of our alumni...

277
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,867
whose last name is Park?

278
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,268
Clang after breakfast, clang after lunch

279
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:22,229
Open the windows and it's raining

280
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,438
Three worms are crawling past

281
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:26,613
How scary, a skeleton

282
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,749
It turned out so well!

283
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,403
Cool.

284
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,297
Wait a minute. What am I doing?

285
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,110
I guess it's been such a long time. I can't concentrate.

286
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:41,974
Come on, let's focus!

287
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:51,957
What an eyesore.

288
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,465
Much better. It's tidy.

289
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:02,546
Now I can concentrate.

290
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,042
When did it get so dirty?

291
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,921
Much better.

292
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,679
Now I can focus on writing.

293
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,200
Shall I begin?

294
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,161
Come on.

295
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,502
What?

296
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,558
Much better. It's perfect, now.

297
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,407
Let me begin, now.

298
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,982
Let me see...

299
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,860
Why is the ink so lumpy?

300
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,941
I used to have a really good pen.

301
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,763
Which brand was it, again?

302
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:12,919
Pens that don't have lumpy ink.

303
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:15,479
I'm telling you,

304
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,148
this has nothing to do with what's wrong and right!

305
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:19,884
What are you talking about?

306
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,561
It's not right to take someone's profits without doing anything.

307
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,153
I, Kook Ki Bong,

308
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,535
was not raised that way.

309
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,635
- My gosh. - Are you all right?

310
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,425
What are you saying?

311
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,508
Hello.

312
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:43,172
I am the head of all levels, Mo,

313
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,345
Kim Chul Min.

314
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,879
Nice to meet you.

315
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,079
I've been told that you've been insisting...

316
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,018
that it's not right to take...

317
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,249
someone's profits without doing anything.

318
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,605
That's right. Even if it's a tough world,

319
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,596
it's just not right.

320
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:01,300
You could think of it that way.

321
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,021
Did you say you used to play baseball?

322
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:05,428
- Yes. - Try to think about it this way.

323
00:16:05,429 --> 00:16:06,829
Bases loaded, nobody out.

324
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,428
You're at bat.

325
00:16:08,429 --> 00:16:10,569
You hit an outfield fly, and you're out.

326
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,638
But you tag up the third base runner and score a point.

327
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,638
That means, even though you're out, you scored your team a point.

328
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:17,312
- That's right. - Would you say...

329
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,538
that is unreasonable too?

330
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:21,099
What? No. It's fair play.

331
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,737
Exactly. Bingo.

332
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,349
Our business is exactly the same.

333
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,018
You can't say you didn't do anything.

334
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:30,619
You introduced our products to a new customer.

335
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,914
It takes effort and care.

336
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:34,158
That is what we're paying you for.

337
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,964
Oh, I see.

338
00:16:36,289 --> 00:16:37,993
Why didn't you explain this way earlier?

339
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,205
You're not a Mo-level member for nothing.

340
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,322
You flatter me.

341
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:45,701
Would you like to work with us now?

342
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:47,574
Yes, I'd like to give it a try.

343
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:49,883
Bravo. Give him a hand.

344
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,471
By the way,

345
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,479
when you start out,

346
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,278
your level is Do.

347
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,901
To become a Mo-level member like me, it takes quite a while.

348
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:03,454
But there is a way to start on the Geol level right away.

349
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:05,518
What is that?

350
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:06,581
A prepayment.

351
00:17:06,729 --> 00:17:07,781
A prepayment?

352
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:10,829
If you make a prepayment of 5,000 dollars,

353
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,196
you can go up to the Geol level immediately.

354
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,920
What?

355
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,668
But if I pay to go up to the Geol level,

356
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:19,995
wouldn't it be cheating?

357
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,555
It's like paying to get a promotion.

358
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,852
It's definitely cheating.

359
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,049
- What? - A new member...

360
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,918
should start at the bottom and work his way up.

361
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:34,254
Let me tell you, I'm not a cheater.

362
00:17:34,449 --> 00:17:36,357
If you keep doing this, I can't work with you guys.

363
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:39,593
Hey, also,

364
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,681
my company will be working on more than 10 films next year.

365
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,955
I'll let you audition for all of them. You can count on me.

366
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:47,398
Really?

367
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,710
Thank you so much, friend.

368
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:55,327
Gosh. I really have to find out what his name is.

369
00:17:57,939 --> 00:17:58,959
I got a text.

370
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:05,003
Gosh, why are there so many Park's?

371
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,383
What should I do?

372
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,752
Min Gu, Min Gu

373
00:18:15,889 --> 00:18:18,799
I used to call you that

374
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,881
Who's Min Gu?

375
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,691
It's nothing.

376
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,635
I'm just looking for a name in my contact list.

377
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,584
Okay. He is not Min Gu.

378
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:32,167
Next. Sung Geun, Sung Geun

379
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:36,024
It's healthy and tasty, Sung Geun

380
00:18:38,979 --> 00:18:43,188
Jong Min, Jong Min, Jong, Jong, Jong, Jong Min

381
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:44,822
Tell me you love me

382
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,759
These days, you sometimes feel like Jae Chul

383
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,958
But sometimes not

384
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:54,633
What are you doing?

385
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:55,954
Who's Jae Chul anyway?

386
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,802
It's just a name that came across my mind.

387
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:06,438
What is this? I've tried every name on the list now.

388
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,385
What is going on?

389
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,152
Was his name omitted from the list?

390
00:19:13,749 --> 00:19:14,973
This is driving me crazy.

391
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,496
What is your name?

392
00:19:19,389 --> 00:19:24,499
What on earth is your name?

393
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,330
Why are you staring at me?

394
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,788
Nothing. I'm just so happy to see you after all these years.

395
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,006
Gosh, you're silly.

396
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:37,009
Hi, Mom. I'm drinking with Jun Ki. We haven't met in a long time.

397
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,809
- Wait, his mom knows me too? - What?

398
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,992
- You want him to come over? - That means we were really close.

399
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,415
- Okay. - Why can't I remember his name?

400
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,789
Jun Ki, my mom wants you to come over.

401
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,686
She'll prepare some food and drinks for us. Let's go.

402
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,158
Wouldn't that be too...

403
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:55,444
Hey. My mom is preparing food and drinks for you.

404
00:19:55,889 --> 00:19:57,928
Don't you remember how much she liked you?

405
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:00,728
I'm so disappointed in you. I really am.

406
00:20:00,729 --> 00:20:01,994
Fine.

407
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,002
Let's go. Let's go to your place.

408
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,621
Are you sure?

409
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,365
Now you're talking.

410
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,930
Let's go, Jun Ki.

411
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,742
Okay, friend.

412
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:17,758
If I don't go, it'll hurt his feelings.

413
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:22,968
Wait. Seeing his mom might help me remember his name.

414
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,212
Come in.

415
00:20:26,489 --> 00:20:28,774
Mom, I'm home! Mom!

416
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,393
- You're here. - Yes.

417
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:37,369
Oh, my. You're Jun Ki?

418
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,205
Yes. Hello.

419
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,594
I still don't remember. I don't even remember his mom.

420
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,249
I don't remember her at all.

421
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:48,305
My goodness. It's been so long.

422
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:50,993
By the way, you look completely different now.

423
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,093
I do? Okay.

424
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,388
Anyway, it's so nice to see you again.

425
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:58,789
You used to come over here and eat with us...

426
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,388
and even sleep over. You remember that?

427
00:21:01,389 --> 00:21:02,409
What?

428
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:05,442
Of course, I do.

429
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,129
I even slept over here?

430
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,069
Your little brother would have loved to see Jun Ki again too.

431
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,466
Exactly.

432
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,539
Even his little brother knows me?

433
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,641
How close were we, really?

434
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,145
I really should quit drinking.

435
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,437
Have a seat. I'll bring some food and drinks.

436
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,778
- Thank you. - No problem.

437
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:33,113
This is driving me crazy.

438
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,452
That's incredible.

439
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,445
I didn't know you could spin a pen like that.

440
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,830
Why am I watching this?

441
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:47,555
I was just looking for ballpoint pens that don't have lumpy ink.

442
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,339
Woo Shik, what's wrong with you?

443
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,564
Aren't you going to write songs?

444
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,399
Pull yourself together and focus.

445
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,555
Woo Shik, come have some chicken with us!

446
00:22:05,689 --> 00:22:06,883
I don't want it.

447
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:11,785
I forgot!

448
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,121
Hey.

449
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:21,284
Didn't I tell you to keep out of this room so that I can focus?

450
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:23,708
I just came up with an amazing melody,

451
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,546
but I forgot it because of you.

452
00:22:26,209 --> 00:22:28,849
I'm sorry. Why don't you still come have some chicken?

453
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,074
I said, I don't want it!

454
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:31,812
Get out. Get out!

455
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:36,520
They're never of any help.

456
00:22:42,229 --> 00:22:43,311
Gosh, my back.

457
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,905
I've probably been sitting too long.

458
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,124
I should lie down for a while.

459
00:22:57,139 --> 00:22:59,730
I'm telling you, it's not cheating.

460
00:22:59,939 --> 00:23:02,357
How can paying to get a promotion not be cheating?

461
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,218
Because people think money can buy everything,

462
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:08,248
our society has become so messed up.

463
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:10,619
I'm not a man...

464
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,210
who cheats his way through life.

465
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,313
Gosh, my blood pressure is going up.

466
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,119
Hello. Ta-da.

467
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:25,173
Three Mo's, no less.

468
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,839
I'm a Three-Mo-level member, Kang Nam Gil.

469
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,440
Oh, hello.

470
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:34,379
I hear you've been arguing that making a prepayment...

471
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,678
to start on the Geol level is cheating.

472
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:40,148
Yes. It's just like paying to get a promotion.

473
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:41,719
It's cheating, definitely.

474
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:45,383
It's understandable that you think that way because you're new to this.

475
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:49,025
But, Mr. Kook, why don't you see it this way?

476
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:52,902
- How? - A pitcher debuted with you.

477
00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:55,347
To save money,

478
00:23:55,469 --> 00:23:57,468
he uses cheap, low-quality equipment.

479
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,569
On the other hand, you invest a lot of money in your equipment...

480
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,668
and even take private lessons. As a result, your skills improve.

481
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:03,879
In the end,

482
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,328
your team appoints you as the starting pitcher.

483
00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:07,905
Would that be cheating?

484
00:24:08,409 --> 00:24:10,042
No, it's not.

485
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,478
I just invested more.

486
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:13,748
- Exactly. Right? - Yes.

487
00:24:13,749 --> 00:24:16,819
A prepayment is just the same. To make that money,

488
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,726
you must have put in time and effort.

489
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,740
That's what our company is willing to compensate for.

490
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,228
How can that be cheating? Don't you agree?

491
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,678
Oh, I see.

492
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,732
Why didn't you explain this way earlier?

493
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:31,284
A Three-Mo level member's explanation...

494
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,763
sure makes sense.

495
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,869
All right. Are you ready to make a prepayment?

496
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,279
It's just 5,000 dollars.

497
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,637
But I don't have 5,000 dollars.

498
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,632
When I checked my account yesterday, I had 5 dollars and 20 cents.

499
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,181
Oh, I see. But you could borrow from someone, right?

500
00:24:47,249 --> 00:24:49,519
- Your parents, for example... - No way. At my age,

501
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,325
I can't ask my parents for money.

502
00:24:51,459 --> 00:24:54,428
That's not the right thing to do.

503
00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:56,859
Then what about friends?

504
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,491
I never borrow money from friends.

505
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,151
It's not the right thing to do.

506
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,668
We have some fabulous loan programs...

507
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,638
My mom told me never to take loans.

508
00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:08,526
It's not right to go against your parents.

509
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,779
What if I lend you...

510
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,908
No way. We only just met.

511
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:17,837
It would be wrong of me if I borrow money from you.

512
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:20,904
Let me just start on the Do level.

513
00:25:20,989 --> 00:25:22,723
I'll work hard and go up little by little.

514
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,706
By the way, does your company offer food as well?

515
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,181
I'm a little hungry.

516
00:25:28,989 --> 00:25:30,081
My goodness.

517
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:33,230
Seriously.

518
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,869
There's no food?

519
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,318
"The right thing to do", my foot.

520
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:43,109
What's with you? You said you'd give me a job.

521
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,379
Forget it and just go! Go!

522
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,134
I can't. I really need a job.

523
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,594
Also, the last bus has already left.

524
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:53,478
Fine. Here.

525
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:55,223
Take a taxi with this and go home.

526
00:25:55,449 --> 00:25:57,259
Go home because it's the right thing to do.

527
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,687
Hey!

528
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:01,669
Wait! Hey!

529
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:04,399
Hey, open up!

530
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,986
I'll really work hard.

531
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,721
I'll start from a Do level, and work up until I reach Three-Mo level.

532
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,343
Come on, please open this door.

533
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,991
Hey!

534
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:17,248
Do you remember when you, my brother, and I...

535
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,315
went to the amusement park...

536
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:22,579
and my brother felt sick during the ride...

537
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,334
and puked all over you? Do you remember?

538
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:26,571
What?

539
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,716
Yes, of course I remember.

540
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,742
I can't remember.

541
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,657
I can't remember at all.

542
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,891
How could this be?

543
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,522
Mom, what is that?

544
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,201
You said Jun Ki became an actor.

545
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,898
Before he becomes more famous, I want to get his autograph.

546
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:44,898
Good idea.

547
00:26:44,899 --> 00:26:47,708
Jun Ki, can you give me your autograph?

548
00:26:47,709 --> 00:26:48,832
What?

549
00:26:49,209 --> 00:26:51,178
Sure, of course I can.

550
00:27:01,189 --> 00:27:03,188
(Dear Mother...)

551
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,819
Write my name next to that.

552
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:07,529
What? Your name?

553
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,815
Yes. Why?

554
00:27:09,189 --> 00:27:11,198
No, it's nothing.

555
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,768
This is driving me crazy.

556
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:17,292
What should I do?

557
00:27:19,699 --> 00:27:21,780
First place in the marathon, Park Jong Oh?

558
00:27:22,639 --> 00:27:23,793
Hold on.

559
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,280
There's no way his dad would've won the marathon.

560
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:28,438
Then is that his name?

561
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,589
Wait. What is that?

562
00:27:33,149 --> 00:27:35,088
Second place in the marathon, Park Jong Woo?

563
00:27:36,149 --> 00:27:39,424
Right. He said he had a brother.

564
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,635
Then it's Park Jong Oh or Park Jong Woo.

565
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:45,169
One of those two is his name.

566
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:46,927
Why are you hesitating so much?

567
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,557
Don't tell me you don't know my name.

568
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,065
Of course not.

569
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:54,974
How could I not know your name?

570
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:57,063
Jong Wooh!

571
00:27:58,179 --> 00:27:59,567
Don't be ridiculous.

572
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,802
(Park Jong...)

573
00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:11,730
Woo? Oh?

574
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,524
It's a 50 percent probability.

575
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,981
Okay, I'll just guess.

576
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:18,953
I'll leave it up to my luck.

577
00:28:19,929 --> 00:28:21,603
Please let me be right!

578
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,762
What are you looking at?

579
00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:26,264
Sign it if you're finished.

580
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,292
I was right! His name was Jung Woo!

581
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,631
Your name was Jung Woo.

582
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,207
It's nice to meet you, Jung Woo.

583
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:38,501
Wait. Did I have a friend named Jung Woo?

584
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,906
Whatever.

585
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,746
Okay, Jung Woo.

586
00:28:42,249 --> 00:28:43,821
I'll sign it, Jung Woo.

587
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:53,276
Lee...

588
00:28:53,659 --> 00:28:54,823
Lee Jun Ki?

589
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,068
- Jun... - It isn't Kang Jun Ki?

590
00:28:58,199 --> 00:29:00,484
- Ki! - No.

591
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,597
It is Kang Jun Ki.

592
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,645
Jung Woo, what do you think? Doesn't my autograph look cool?

593
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,150
Jun Ki, did you by any chance...

594
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,119
change your name or use a stage name?

595
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,915
Why would I change my name?

596
00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:15,163
It's a precious name my parents made for me.

597
00:29:15,249 --> 00:29:16,412
Is that so?

598
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,281
Hey. What was the name of our university?

599
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,759
Maybe it's the alcohol. I can't remember suddenly.

600
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,329
What? No matter how drunk you are,

601
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,961
- how could you forget that? - I know.

602
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:29,799
It's Huam University.

603
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,391
No, it's not. I went to Myeongsung University.

604
00:29:32,739 --> 00:29:34,851
What on earth? Who are you then?

605
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:37,138
What is going on?

606
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,774
Jung Woo, over here.

607
00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:43,419
Why did you come so late?

608
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:44,672
I'm sorry.

609
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,788
- I just ran into Jun Ki. - Jun Ki?

610
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,789
Jun Ki came? Where?

611
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,217
He said he had some urgent business and left.

612
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:52,259
He lost so much weight.

613
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,922
He lost weight? Jun Ki?

614
00:29:54,989 --> 00:29:57,957
That's strange. He was exactly the same till last month.

615
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,922
Hold on.

616
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,417
Let me see if I have his picture.

617
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,691
Here, look.

618
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,079
You're right. He must've been on a diet.

619
00:30:07,169 --> 00:30:08,260
I guess.

620
00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:11,128
Wait. Then this man is...

621
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,232
He's a stranger.

622
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,011
He's a complete stranger.

623
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:16,301
What are you staring at?

624
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,710
My friend Jong Woo.

625
00:30:18,979 --> 00:30:21,549
Jong Woo, we should see each other often from now on.

626
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,121
And I hope you help out with my work.

627
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:24,511
Okay?

628
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,236
Jong Woo, Jong Woo, Jong Woo!

629
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,910
Okay...

630
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:33,097
Darn it. I can't even ask who he is now. What should I do?

631
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,898
Hey, it's pretty late. Shouldn't you get going now?

632
00:30:37,899 --> 00:30:40,520
Go where? He should just spend the night here.

633
00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:42,873
Jun Ki, is that okay?

634
00:30:42,939 --> 00:30:44,204
Yes, ma'am.

635
00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:48,404
It's been so long since I spent the night with Jong Woo.

636
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,132
I'm so happy.

637
00:30:54,989 --> 00:30:57,611
Jong Woo, do you remember that time?

638
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:02,560
You know, when our club performed at a girls' university.

639
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:05,158
We hit our heads with solid wooden sticks...

640
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:06,964
and bled like crazy.

641
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,070
The girls fainted and stuff. Do you remember?

642
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:10,521
I don't.

643
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,805
I don't even know where Huam University is.

644
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:15,144
How could I know about your super strength club?

645
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,217
Who on earth are you?

646
00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:24,062
We had so much fun back then.

647
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,901
- Right, Jong Woo? - Well... I guess.

648
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:32,768
Jong Woo, let's be friends forever.

649
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:35,026
Jong Woo.

650
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,645
Jong Woo, Park Jong Woo!

651
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,810
What? What happened?

652
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,362
Where am I?

653
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,706
I fell asleep.

654
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,402
What time is it?

655
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,543
Four?

656
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,273
4am?

657
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:03,994
Darn it. How many hours did I sleep?

658
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:05,511
Darn.

659
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,435
This is so frustrating.

660
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,869
I didn't even draw a single note all day.

661
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,022
Stupid, stupid!

662
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,542
I'll really focus now.

663
00:32:18,939 --> 00:32:20,062
Focus!

664
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,043
I'm out of coffee.

665
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:31,613
I can't work without coffee.

666

668
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:42,779
(Even Just for A Minute)

669
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,267
(Even Just for A Minute)

670
00:33:57,229 --> 00:33:58,938
You look so exhausted.

671
00:33:58,939 --> 00:34:00,297
Why are you yawning so much?

672
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:04,110
I didn't get any sleep after shooting all night.

673
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:06,108
What kind of shoot was it this time?

674
00:34:06,409 --> 00:34:08,748
I went to Anmyeondo to see an octopus doing...

675
00:34:08,749 --> 00:34:10,208
Michael Jackson's moonwalk.

676
00:34:10,209 --> 00:34:12,463
What? An octopus can do a moonwalk?

677
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:16,509
- Did it really do it? - Yes, it really did.

678
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:20,733
It used its suckers to walk backwards, and it was fascinating.

679
00:34:21,229 --> 00:34:24,972
But a drunk customer dipped it in chojang and ate it by mistake,

680
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,058
so we had to stop shooting and it was a total mess.

681
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:28,151
What?

682
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:30,676
Someone dipped an octopus doing a moonwalk in chojang and ate it?

683
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,465
- How could this be possible? - Tell me about it.

684
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:37,489
So we came up with a new item and had to shoot all night.

685
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,053
Being a reporter is way harder than I thought.

686
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,179
You should've come faster. Your soup is getting cold.

687
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,270
Hurry up and eat.

688
00:34:48,749 --> 00:34:50,076
Where is Woo Shik?

689
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,518
He went out to record a song he wrote.

690
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:55,039
Really? He must've finally finished it.

691
00:34:55,189 --> 00:34:56,311
I'm glad.

692
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,828
Who are you calling so early in the morning?

693
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:03,470
It's Jong Woo, an old friend from my college club.

694
00:35:03,729 --> 00:35:06,698
He's suddenly avoiding my calls and refuses to meet me at work.

695
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:09,208
Did I make a mistake?

696
00:35:09,209 --> 00:35:11,321
He must be busy. Go on and eat.

697
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,574
What's wrong with you?

698
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:18,438
A friend of mine introduced a really nice job to me,

699
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,980
but I was kicked out before I even started.

700
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:25,151
I really wanted to work at Global Network Marketing Yutnori.

701
00:35:26,019 --> 00:35:27,285
You should've tried harder.

702
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:30,445
Still, you should try to have a bite. Okay?

703
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:31,920
Okay.

704
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,013
Yu Ri, you're starting business from your food truck today, right?

705
00:35:36,399 --> 00:35:37,623
Are you done preparing?

706
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,139
Do you need any help?

707
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:42,505
It's okay. I've already prepared thoroughly for everything.

708
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:44,432
By the way, Ki Bong,

709
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,953
there is one thing you can help me with.

710
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,971
What is it?

711
00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:57,855
(A Dramatic Night)

712
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,337
This is unbelievable.

713
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,598
How did you think to start a food truck not knowing how to drive?

714
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,334
I just haven't driven in a long time.

715
00:36:10,899 --> 00:36:13,551
Just help me out until I get the hang of it, all right?

716
00:36:14,169 --> 00:36:15,189
Fine.

717
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:16,990
Hello.

718
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,578
Hello.

719
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:20,538
- You must be new around here. - Yes.

720
00:36:20,539 --> 00:36:22,998
I'm the owner of the steak rice bowl food truck.

721
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,918
I do tacos. Nice to meet you.

722
00:36:25,919 --> 00:36:27,348
Nice to meet you.

723
00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:28,648
I look forward to working with you.

724
00:36:28,649 --> 00:36:29,771
Us, too.

725
00:36:31,019 --> 00:36:33,305
"Yu Ri's Kitchen 31"?

726
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,423
Are you selling ice cream?

727
00:36:35,729 --> 00:36:38,058
No, I'm selling pasta.

728
00:36:38,059 --> 00:36:40,304
There are 31 items to choose from.

729
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,868
That's a unique concept.

730
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,569
- Isn't it? - Sure.

731
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,647
It's my first time with food trucks.

732
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:53,039
Do you have any tips?

733
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:57,435
Well, not really...

734
00:36:58,419 --> 00:36:59,478
It only needs to taste good.

735
00:36:59,479 --> 00:37:01,765
Any other cheap tricks won't bring in customers.

736
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:04,164
You have to make it taste right.

737
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:09,223
Come and try the charcoal steak rice bowl full of flavor.

738
00:37:11,999 --> 00:37:14,498
The world-famous tacos...

739
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:15,999
have arrived!

740
00:37:36,149 --> 00:37:37,995
Finally, I can take a nap.

741
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,524
They sent me the pay.

742
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,828
(Minjoong Bank, Deposit: 1,213.20 dollars)

743
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:48,972
I guess this is my first ever salary.

744
00:37:50,399 --> 00:37:51,869
What should I do with it?

745
00:37:52,899 --> 00:37:55,214
I should get each of our guesthouse members a present.

746
00:37:56,309 --> 00:37:57,534
What do I get them?

747
00:37:59,309 --> 00:38:00,462
Maybe I should ask them.

748
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:07,174
What's up with his room?

749
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:10,776
He messed up his room, trying to write a song.

750
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:12,821
Why doesn't he clean up in between?

751
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:18,521
Let me see what he wrote.

752
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:29,870
Let's see... "I wonder what's on your mind."

753
00:38:30,939 --> 00:38:32,541
Look at these lyrics.

754
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,379
It shakes your heart and makes you cry.

755
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,819
He's been pretending to be fine, but it was all a lie.

756
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,411
What do you mean? What's wrong with it?

757
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:40,539
Take a look.

758
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:43,248
These words are all for Soo Yeon.

759
00:38:43,249 --> 00:38:45,402
Oh, is that it?

760
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:48,159
But he looked fine.

761
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,058
That's because he's pretending to be fine...

762
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:52,406
to make her feel comfortable.

763
00:38:52,459 --> 00:38:54,768
Did he really like her that much?

764
00:38:54,769 --> 00:38:56,432
Are you kidding?

765
00:38:56,729 --> 00:38:59,168
He liked Soo Yeon...

766
00:38:59,169 --> 00:39:00,938
ever since high school.

767
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:02,878
- Really? - That's not all.

768
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,538
Do you remember when he had his head shaved at the protest?

769
00:39:05,539 --> 00:39:08,364
He did that to help Soo Yeon keep her job.

770
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:11,130
And do you remember when he almost got killed at the gangsters' event?

771
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,978
He did that to provide money for her tuition.

772
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:15,010
Really?

773
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:17,085
That's quite romantic.

774
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:20,498
I hope I can find a guy like Woo Shik.

775
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,476
In your dreams!

776
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,529
Wake up, already.

777
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:29,828
Why would a guy like that go out with you?

778
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:32,199
Who would ever go out with someone...

779
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,009
who's as violent and monstrous...

780
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:37,609
as you, King Kong?

781
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,108
What? Monstrous?

782
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:40,631
Do you want to die?

783
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,078
Come over here.

784
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,248
Help! Help me, Tarzan!

785
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:47,156
King Kong is killing me!

786
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,081
What are you doing here, Soo Yeon?

787
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,812
It's nothing.

788
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,898
I thought you went to the studio to record.

789
00:40:02,899 --> 00:40:04,296
I had to come get something.

790
00:40:05,939 --> 00:40:06,959
Here.

791
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:08,591
What's this?

792
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,078
It's hotteok.

793
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,438
It reminded me of you, so I bought some on the way.

794
00:40:13,439 --> 00:40:14,459
You like hotteok.

795
00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:19,273
- Thanks. - Don't mention it. It's nothing.

796
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:21,511
What was that?

797
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:22,889
What's that noise?

798
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:25,307
- Let go. Let go! - Why, you!

799
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,989
Let go!

800
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,328
I said, let go!

801
00:40:28,329 --> 00:40:29,859
- You! - What's this?

802
00:40:30,329 --> 00:40:32,166
What are you doing in here?

803
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,799
He kept picking on me.

804
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,503
- No, you started it first! - Be quiet!

805
00:40:36,899 --> 00:40:38,021
Clean this mess up.

806
00:40:45,479 --> 00:40:46,560
Oh, no!

807
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:49,203
It broke!

808
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,087
It's my favorite album!

809
00:40:53,479 --> 00:40:55,458
Woo Shik, we're sorry.

810
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:57,611
I...

811
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,952
I'll get you a new one.

812
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:02,907
This is the first edition. Do you know how hard it is to get that?

813
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,387
What are you going to do about it?

814
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:07,262
How are you going to repay it?

815
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,090
Woo Shik.

816
00:41:11,439 --> 00:41:12,928
Calm down.

817
00:41:13,869 --> 00:41:16,109
Relax.

818
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,497
Relax, my foot.

819
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,443
Come over here. Come on.

820
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:22,947
Come here.

821
00:41:35,789 --> 00:41:38,498
He liked Soo Yeon...

822
00:41:38,499 --> 00:41:40,295
ever since high school.

823
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:47,267
Do you remember when he had his head shaved at the protest?

824
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,609
He did that to help Soo Yeon keep her job.

825
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:53,160
I came over because I heard our boss is going on a hunger strike.

826
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,318
But why are you doing it?

827
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,394
- The thing is... - He made you do this, didn't he?

828
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,049
I'll go tell him off.

829
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,621
Hey, don't! Don't do that.

830
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:05,548
He didn't make me do anything. I just wanted to take part.

831
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,905
And do you remember when he almost got killed at the gangsters' event?

832
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:11,374
He did that to provide money for her tuition.

833
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,498
Then you don't have to go to the newscaster academy anymore?

834
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:16,129
What do you mean?

835
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:17,558
What newscaster academy?

836
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,622
It's nothing.

837
00:42:22,939 --> 00:42:24,093
So that's what happened.

838
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,565
Is that it?

839
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,277
I've only been receiving things from Woo Shik.

840
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:40,662
What can I do for him?

841
00:42:43,689 --> 00:42:45,359
Soo Yeon, where's Woo Shik?

842
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,759
He went to the studio for the recording.

843
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,821
He did?

844
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,790
What a relief.

845
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:53,192
How long have we been hiding in there?

846
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,920
How could he do this to us just because we broke an album?

847
00:42:56,169 --> 00:42:57,868
There's something wrong with him.

848
00:42:57,869 --> 00:42:59,645
It was his favorite album.

849
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:01,800
Wait a minute.

850
00:43:02,979 --> 00:43:04,879
Which album was it again?

851
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,716
It was Kim Kwang Seok's fourth album or something.

852
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:08,511
- Why? - What?

853
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:10,146
It's nothing.

854
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,489
(Secondhand Market)

855
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,703
(Kim Kwang Seok, fourth album)

856
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,250
I found it!

857
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,370
(Kim Kwang Seok, Fourth Album)

858
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:24,868
Okay.

859
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:35,471
Hello?

860
00:43:35,749 --> 00:43:38,943
I'm interested in something you're selling on Secondhand Market.

861
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,513
We're home.

862
00:43:43,689 --> 00:43:44,741
Hey.

863
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,402
How did it go today?

864
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,188
It was a complete failure.

865
00:43:51,189 --> 00:43:53,199
Why? Didn't you have any customers?

866
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,759
Not one.

867
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,177
The competition was so tough.

868
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,739
The others were spitting...

869
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:02,137
fire and rainbows to attract customers.

870
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:05,279
It was practically a circus site.

871
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,584
I can't just stand there and watch.

872
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:10,078
We need to come up with shocking performance.

873
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,279
What would we be able to do?

874
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,422
What can we do?

875
00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:16,369
We have to fight...

876
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:18,114
fire with fire.

877
00:44:25,258 --> 00:44:26,111
What's keeping you?

878
00:44:26,295 --> 00:44:27,223
Hurry up and begin the show.

879
00:44:28,531 --> 00:44:29,989
Do we really have to do this?

880
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,459
I'm scared.

881
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,857
What do you mean, you're scared?

882
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,829
You were able to get 1 out of 5 tries.

883
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:38,169
That's not important. I failed the four other times!

884
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:40,037
Why do you only think about failing?

885
00:44:40,301 --> 00:44:42,350
You might succeed this time.

886
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:45,439
Besides, if we fail the business,

887
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,857
your investment will have been for nothing.

888
00:44:48,011 --> 00:44:49,744
So, hurry up.

889
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:51,873
All right, then.

890
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,845
I'm scared...

891
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,873
What happened? You swallowed it?

892
00:45:08,201 --> 00:45:10,006
I'm sorry. I was feeling too nervous.

893
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,919
Gosh. Try again.

894
00:45:19,011 --> 00:45:20,744
Wait. You swallowed it again?

895
00:45:21,011 --> 00:45:23,709
You're supposed to spit fire!

896
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:25,353
Sorry. Let me try again.

897
00:45:33,361 --> 00:45:35,472
Wait. Again?

898
00:45:36,031 --> 00:45:38,090
Hey, stop drinking it.

899
00:45:38,091 --> 00:45:40,099
Spit fire instead!

900
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,634
You were supposed to spit fire. Why did you drink the whole bottle?

901
00:45:48,201 --> 00:45:50,047
I was scared.

902
00:45:52,141 --> 00:45:53,436
Forget it then.

903
00:45:54,011 --> 00:45:55,101
Let's try...

904
00:45:55,781 --> 00:45:58,433
puking rainbows instead. Open your mouth.

905
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:03,186
Come on. Puke.

906
00:46:03,721 --> 00:46:04,811
Puke.

907
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:10,490
- You swallowed that too? - I'm sorry.

908
00:46:10,491 --> 00:46:13,184
I just wanted to swallow my saliva,

909
00:46:13,661 --> 00:46:15,099
but I ended up swallowing that too.

910
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,399
Gosh, you idiot.

911
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,205
Throw it up. Right now.

912
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,309
- Gosh. - It tasted good.

913
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:24,207
- Give me one more. - Seriously?

914
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,774
You're driving me crazy.

915
00:46:27,381 --> 00:46:31,280
As long as I can see you smile

916
00:46:31,281 --> 00:46:35,550
I can put up with any pain

917
00:46:35,551 --> 00:46:38,448
Please

918
00:46:38,991 --> 00:46:44,366
Open your heart to me

919
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,430
Hey, what did you think?

920
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:50,961
This song is really good.

921
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,200
I love the lyrics.

922
00:46:52,201 --> 00:46:53,903
- I think it'll be a hit. - Really?

923
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,510
Can you ask what your company thinks of it too?

924
00:46:57,511 --> 00:46:58,806
Of course.

925
00:46:59,181 --> 00:47:00,410
Can you sing it one more time?

926
00:47:00,411 --> 00:47:01,635
Sure.

927
00:47:06,051 --> 00:47:07,509
It arrived early.

00:47:12,591 --> 00:47:14,760
(Kim Kwang Seok, Fourth Album)

929
00:47:14,761 --> 00:47:15,914
It's the one I wanted.

930
00:47:17,261 --> 00:47:19,953
Why is such an old album so expensive?

931
00:47:20,931 --> 00:47:22,838
Still, it'd make Woo Shik really happy.

932
00:47:26,701 --> 00:47:27,823
What's this smell?

933
00:47:31,411 --> 00:47:32,635
I think it's coming from here.

934
00:47:34,611 --> 00:47:35,702
What could it be?

935
00:47:36,111 --> 00:47:37,809
(Roasted seaweed)

936
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:38,974
Seaweed?

937
00:47:48,091 --> 00:47:49,284
What are these?

938
00:47:50,361 --> 00:47:52,197
Why did I get these instead of a record?

939
00:47:52,301 --> 00:47:54,239
(Roasted seaweed)

940
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:55,852
Wait.

941
00:47:56,971 --> 00:47:58,123
No way.

942
00:48:03,841 --> 00:48:07,176
Kim, Kwang, Seok.

943
00:48:07,641 --> 00:48:09,007
Fourth album?

944
00:48:10,681 --> 00:48:11,803
Darn it.

945
00:48:13,781 --> 00:48:15,525
I got conned.

946
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:20,459
I can't believe this jerk.

947
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:21,715
I just threw away my money.

948
00:48:24,161 --> 00:48:25,353
There it is.

949
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:32,824
Hello?

950
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:36,809
I saw you're selling Kim Kwang Seok's fourth album.

951
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:39,079
Are you sure you have it?

952
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,162
Can you promise?

953
00:48:41,641 --> 00:48:42,874
I'd like to buy it.

954
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:47,081
But I don't want you to send it. Let's meet in person.

955
00:48:47,281 --> 00:48:48,403
In person.

956
00:48:48,491 --> 00:48:51,713
- Guys, we're home. - Guys.

957
00:48:51,891 --> 00:48:54,613
- We're home. - Try to walk.

958
00:48:54,761 --> 00:48:56,086
Fire.

959
00:48:56,531 --> 00:48:58,160
Fire.

960
00:48:58,161 --> 00:48:59,760
Wait a second. What happened to Ki Bong?

961
00:48:59,761 --> 00:49:02,484
Whatever. I'm exhausted.

962
00:49:02,801 --> 00:49:03,954
Gosh, he reeks of alcohol.

963
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,099
He drank?

964
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,499
Don't get me started.

965
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,264
I ruined my day because of him.

966
00:49:11,071 --> 00:49:13,896
I've had almost no customers. I'm only losing money.

967
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,755
What if I go bankrupt?

968
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,859
Gosh, he's such a fool.

969
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,110
- Jun Ki, take him to his bed. - Okay.

970
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:27,059
Ki Bong, get ahold of yourself.

971
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,559
- Take off your backpack first. - Just a second.

972
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,530
I want to throw up.

973
00:49:31,531 --> 00:49:32,630
What?

974
00:49:32,631 --> 00:49:34,844
No! Hold it in.

975
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,399
I can't.

976
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:37,756
- No! - No!

977
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,092
Oh, my.

978
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:45,365
What is this? What is he throwing up?

979
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,478
- He finally threw it up. - Why did it stop, though?

980
00:49:47,681 --> 00:49:48,936
My goodness.

981
00:49:51,111 --> 00:49:52,273
What is this?

982
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:55,619
Ki Bong. What is this?

983
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:57,150
What? Purple?

984
00:49:58,721 --> 00:49:59,843
Take it.

985
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:04,493
What is this? Yellow?

986
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:05,922
Unbelievable.

987
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,982
What is this? My goodness.

988
00:50:09,431 --> 00:50:10,594
Red!

989
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:14,131
What's next? Let's see.

990
00:50:22,111 --> 00:50:23,232
Excuse me.

991
00:50:24,111 --> 00:50:25,649
Is Ms. Han Soo Yeon in?

992
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:27,849
What? That's me.

993
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:30,605
Hello. You wanted to buy Kim Kwang Seok's fourth album from me.

994
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,745
Hello.

995
00:50:33,391 --> 00:50:35,196
Can I see it first?

996

It's the real record this time.

1001

Here you go.

1002
00:50:54,411 --> 00:50:55,635
Thank you.

1003
00:50:55,881 --> 00:50:58,227
- Well, bye. - Bye.

1004
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,450
I finally got my hands on it.

1005
00:51:05,491 --> 00:51:07,633
I love Kim Kwang Seok's songs too.

1006
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:09,685
Should I play it?

1007
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,979

1008
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:30,709
that all of the five Skandhas are empty...

1009
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:34,280
and overcame all ill-being

Hey!

00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:55,663
Hey!

1019
00:52:00,911 --> 00:52:04,246

1020
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:05,871
Already?

1021
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:09,070
We have no customers anyway. What's the point?

1022
00:52:10,091 --> 00:52:11,519
Let's go home.

1023
00:52:11,721 --> 00:52:13,700
Let's stay just a little longer.

1024
00:52:14,391 --> 00:52:15,513
We can do this!

1025

Ki Bong, I'm sorry.

1026

on this food truck.

1028
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:26,004
This is so embarrassing.

1029
00:52:26,241 --> 00:52:27,393
Don't worry.

1030
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,269
We're just not advertised enough yet.

1031
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:31,280

1033
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:38,024
I probably didn't realize how hard this is.

1034
00:52:39,451 --> 00:52:40,706
I'm not even surprised.

1035
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:44,088

1036
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:49,033
Yu Ri, let's give it one more try.

1037
00:52:49,661 --> 00:52:51,490
You worked so hard for this.

1038
00:52:51,491 --> 00:52:53,540
You can't just give up like this.

1039
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,348
But there's nothing I can do.

1040
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,510
Yu Ri, let's forget about spitting fire...

1041
00:53:02,511 --> 00:53:03,633
or puking rainbows.

- What? - Wake up.

Hey.

1060
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,815
I dozed off.

1061
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,683
What's the matter?

1062
00:53:55,591 --> 00:53:57,089
- Who is she? - Introduce yourself.

1063
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,468
- She is our team manager. - Hello.

I'm Kim Su Jin, Head of Strategy at Flower Record.

Oh, hello.

1066
00:54:08,641 --> 00:54:10,140
What brings you here?

1067
00:54:10,641 --> 00:54:13,670
I listened to your song, and I loved it.

1068
00:54:13,781 --> 00:54:16,749
I'd love to work with you.

1069
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:19,950
What? Do you mean you want to produce my album?

1070
00:54:19,951 --> 00:54:21,246
No, that's not it.

1071
00:54:21,681 --> 00:54:24,649
We're debuting a new singer soon.

1072
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:27,019
I was thinking your song would suit him very well.

1073
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:28,550
Pardon? What do you mean...

1074
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,246
- You want me to sell my song? - Exactly.

1075
00:54:32,701 --> 00:54:35,030
And don't worry about how much you'll get paid.

1076
00:54:35,031 --> 00:54:36,907
Forget it. I'm not selling my song.

1077
00:54:37,571 --> 00:54:38,753
Excuse me.

1078
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:40,696
Hey, wait.

1079
00:54:41,571 --> 00:54:42,967
What's with you?

1080
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:45,504
Why are you leaving in the middle of the conversation?

1081
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:47,308
I have nothing more to say.

1082
00:54:47,641 --> 00:54:49,619
I didn't make that song to sell it.

1083
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:52,568
- I made it to sing it myself. - I know.

1084
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:53,875
I know how you feel.

1085
00:54:54,821 --> 00:54:57,136
But let's face it.

1086
00:54:57,551 --> 00:55:00,171
No one in this country...

1087
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:01,915
will want to produce your album.

1088
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,182
You know that too.

1089
00:55:06,201 --> 00:55:08,373
This kind of opportunity doesn't come along easily.

1090
00:55:08,631 --> 00:55:11,329
And if this goes well and your song gets famous,

1091
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:12,667
it's a good thing for you.

1092
00:55:13,641 --> 00:55:16,539
Then one day, you might be able to release your own album.

1093
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:17,809
Still, this is...

1094
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:19,412
Then are you going to let that song go to waste?

1095
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,940
Are you going to sing it in your room only?

1096
00:55:21,181 --> 00:55:22,946
Don't you want people to hear it?

1097
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,235
Hey, get a grasp of reality,

1098
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,009
and stop being so stubborn.

1099
00:55:31,807 --> 00:55:32,876
Try some of our food.

1100
00:55:32,877 --> 00:55:34,806

1102

This is really yummy. Try some of our...

1106
00:55:48,658 --> 00:55:49,987
Let's call it quits.

1107
00:55:49,988 --> 00:55:52,914
What are you talking about? We should keep trying.

1108
00:55:53,497 --> 00:55:54,650
We've tried enough.

1109
00:55:55,057 --> 00:55:57,882
So let's call it a day.

1110
00:55:58,968 --> 00:56:00,936
Yu Ri. Wait!

1111
00:56:02,198 --> 00:56:03,259
What is this?

1112
00:56:05,807 --> 00:56:07,062
What's wrong with this tire?

1113
00:56:08,178 --> 00:56:09,433
I think it's been punctured.

1114
00:56:12,247 --> 00:56:14,869
Seriously, why is everything going so wrong?

1115
00:56:15,548 --> 00:56:17,588
I feel so hopeless.

1116
00:56:17,787 --> 00:56:19,516
You can just change the tire.

1117
00:56:19,517 --> 00:56:22,486
I'll do it in no time, so you should get some rest. Okay?

1118
00:56:28,327 --> 00:56:29,389
This is so hard.

1119
00:56:30,068 --> 00:56:31,496
Why am I sweating so much?

1120

He looks so cool.

1121
00:57:05,198 --> 00:57:06,462
What's the matter?

1122
00:57:06,897 --> 00:57:08,265
It's just...

1123
00:57:08,638 --> 00:57:09,806
What's the tastiest menu here?

1124
00:57:09,807 --> 00:57:10,827
What?

1125
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,146
Everything is tasty. We have a variety of menus too.

1126
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:14,637
Take a look at the menu.

1127
00:57:14,638 --> 00:57:15,699
Okay.

1128
00:57:18,247 --> 00:57:20,114
What are you doing? We have customers.

1129
00:57:21,517 --> 00:57:24,387
I wonder why they came suddenly. It's strange.

1130
00:57:24,388 --> 00:57:25,918
There's a good reason.

1131
00:57:28,258 --> 00:57:29,379
Why are you smiling?

1132
00:57:29,588 --> 00:57:31,118
What's wrong? You're scaring me.

Here is your Almond Vongole.

1135
00:57:48,437 --> 00:57:49,671
This is so tiring.

1136
00:57:50,377 --> 00:57:52,724
Why does she keep making me switch tires?

1137
00:57:53,647 --> 00:57:55,484
Right, she told me to drink water regularly.

Enjoy your meal.

1140
00:58:08,857 --> 00:58:10,356
You made the right choice.

1141
00:58:10,497 --> 00:58:12,896
How much do you have in mind for your song?

1142
00:58:12,897 --> 00:58:14,499
You can take care of that.

1143
00:58:14,698 --> 00:58:18,036
Instead, I'd like to be in charge of producing my song.

1144
00:58:18,037 --> 00:58:20,731
We'd be grateful if you do that yourself.

1145
00:58:21,738 --> 00:58:24,532
By the way, who is the new singer who will sing my song?

1146
00:58:25,247 --> 00:58:26,447
Ma'am, I'm here.

1147
00:58:26,448 --> 00:58:28,447
Hello. Come and say hi.

1148

He's the songwriter who decided to give you his song.

1149
00:58:30,818 --> 00:58:31,939
- Hello... - Hello.

1150
00:58:33,287 --> 00:58:34,410
Mr. Cha.

Min Ah.

1152

You're the one who's singing my song?

1153
00:58:40,598 --> 00:58:42,708
Wait, do you two know each other?

1154
00:58:42,928 --> 00:58:45,126
Yes, I received vocal training lessons...

1155
00:58:45,127 --> 00:58:46,932
from him a long time ago.

1156
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:49,507
Mr. Cha, how long has it been?

1157
00:58:49,508 --> 00:58:50,997
I know. It's been ages.

1158
00:58:52,408 --> 00:58:54,070
Guys.

1159
00:58:54,377 --> 00:58:56,142
We're home.

1160
00:58:56,778 --> 00:58:59,165
What is it? Why do you sound so happy today?

1161
00:58:59,318 --> 00:59:02,217
Guys, we had an amazing day today.

1162
00:59:02,218 --> 00:59:03,587
We sold everything we prepared.

1163
00:59:03,588 --> 00:59:05,077
- Really? - Yes.

1164
00:59:05,548 --> 00:59:09,086
This is all thanks to my cute Ki Bong.

1165
00:59:09,327 --> 00:59:10,409
What about him?

1166
00:59:10,557 --> 00:59:12,843
Mind your own business. You don't have to know.

1167
00:59:12,997 --> 00:59:14,896
So? How much did you make today?

1168
00:59:14,897 --> 00:59:17,297
Well, excluding the prime cost, costs for ingredients,

1169
00:59:17,298 --> 00:59:18,797
costs for the free tasting event,

1170
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:20,021
and costs for gas...

1171
00:59:24,267 --> 00:59:25,359
I have a dollar left.

1172
00:59:25,537 --> 00:59:27,272
What? A dollar?

1173
00:59:28,238 --> 00:59:31,407
Hey. Still, this is our first income.

1174
00:59:31,408 --> 00:59:33,182
At least we're in the black.

1175
00:59:33,577 --> 00:59:36,746
Ki Bong, shall we throw a party to congratulate a successful day?

1176
00:59:36,747 --> 00:59:38,175
A party? Shall we?

1177
00:59:38,517 --> 00:59:39,812
- Let's go. - Okay.

1178
00:59:39,857 --> 00:59:42,286
Yes! It's time to party!

1179
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:43,427
How could they throw a party with a dollar?

1180
00:59:43,428 --> 00:59:46,283
- This is exciting. - Let's go.

1181
00:59:48,557 --> 00:59:51,526
I went to all the used LP stores and finally found this.

1182
00:59:52,738 --> 00:59:53,758
I'm so tired.

1183
00:59:55,838 --> 00:59:58,214
Still, I bet Woo Shik will be so happy when he sees this.

1184
01:00:03,747 --> 01:00:05,338
Thank you. Drive safely.

- Woo Shik... - Mr. Cha!

1186
01:00:08,417 --> 01:00:10,764
Then will we be able to see each other more often?

1187
01:00:10,818 --> 01:00:13,087
Don't get too excited. You know that I'm a picky teacher, right?

1188
01:00:13,088 --> 01:00:14,516
Of course I do.

1189
01:00:14,517 --> 01:00:16,326
You always gave me a hard time back then.

1190
01:00:16,327 --> 01:00:18,633
I didn't give you a hard time. It was my affection for my pupil.

Why don't we go and get a cup of coffee?

1194
01:00:24,667 --> 01:00:26,467
Why drink coffee at this hour?

1195
01:00:26,468 --> 01:00:28,885
Why? It's not even nine yet.

01:00:31,738 --> 01:00:33,207
