1
00:00:18,127 --> 00:00:19,689
Hey, Jun Ki, get up.

2
00:00:20,397 --> 00:00:22,743
What's gotten into you these past few days?

3
00:00:25,638 --> 00:00:27,067
Come on, get up.

4
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,842
Are you really going to quit acting?

5
00:00:29,938 --> 00:00:31,640
I can't take this anymore.

6
00:00:37,207 --> 00:00:40,440
Jun Ki, get up already.

7
00:00:40,578 --> 00:00:41,913
Jun Ki!

8
00:00:50,328 --> 00:00:53,419
(Everybody Has Secrets)

9
00:00:57,868 --> 00:00:59,774
Eat slowly, you'll get a stomachache.

10
00:00:59,798 --> 00:01:03,001
I want to eat slowly too, but it's almost time for my shoot.

11
00:01:03,038 --> 00:01:04,395
What are you shooting today?

12
00:01:04,508 --> 00:01:07,306
In Paju, I heard there's a turtle that's faster than a rabbit.

13
00:01:07,307 --> 00:01:09,406
What? A turtle is faster than a rabbit?

14
00:01:09,407 --> 00:01:11,677
Yes. I heard it runs 100m in 20 seconds or something.

15
00:01:11,678 --> 00:01:12,698
20 seconds?

16
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:14,446
Are you saying that turtle is faster than me?

17
00:01:14,447 --> 00:01:17,087
I guess. That's why his name is "Usain Turtle".

18
00:01:17,088 --> 00:01:18,649
Wow, that's fascinating.

19
00:01:22,857 --> 00:01:25,196
Mr. Cha, did you enjoy your breakfast?

20
00:01:25,197 --> 00:01:27,056
Then I'll see you later at the studio.

21
00:01:27,057 --> 00:01:29,005
Why is she texting me so early in the morning?

22
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:31,336
Who? Min Ah?

23
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:33,269
Oh, that student of yours?

24
00:01:34,038 --> 00:01:35,465
I heard you're her first love.

25
00:01:38,437 --> 00:01:41,237
- That's not true. - What are you talking about?

26
00:01:41,238 --> 00:01:43,348
I heard she actually said it to you.

27
00:01:44,678 --> 00:01:47,197
I'm finished. I'll go meet Usain Turtle then.

28
00:01:47,378 --> 00:01:49,223
- See you later. - Bye.

29
00:01:50,288 --> 00:01:52,817
Hey, don't say anything stupid in front of Soo Yeon.

30
00:01:52,818 --> 00:01:53,939
What?

31
00:01:54,318 --> 00:01:56,980
Didn't you and Soo Yeon decide to stay as friends?

32
00:01:57,557 --> 00:01:58,852
Well, yes, but...

33
00:01:59,197 --> 00:02:02,084
- Whatever. - Why are you getting mad at me?

34
00:02:04,838 --> 00:02:06,939
Jung Eun, how is Jun Ki doing?

35
00:02:07,068 --> 00:02:09,166
I don't know. He's still not saying anything.

36
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:11,737
What do you think happened to him?

37
00:02:11,738 --> 00:02:13,406
What does he mean by "quit acting"?

38
00:02:13,407 --> 00:02:14,458
I'm not sure.

39
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:17,298
It seems quite serious, judging by his state.

40
00:02:17,507 --> 00:02:18,874
Just leave him alone for now.

41
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:20,276
When I was kicked out of my team,

42
00:02:20,277 --> 00:02:22,286
it was more stressful when people tried to talk to me.

43
00:02:22,588 --> 00:02:24,417
At times like that, it may be better to be alone.

44
00:02:24,418 --> 00:02:26,702
But what if he really gives up on acting?

45
00:02:27,888 --> 00:02:29,957
I'm going to find out what happened...

46
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,386
and make him come to his senses.

47
00:02:39,238 --> 00:02:41,176
Yu Ri, did you get up now?

48
00:02:41,238 --> 00:02:43,552
Yes. I slept in.

49
00:02:44,037 --> 00:02:45,207
Are you going to take a shower?

50
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,228
Yes.

51
00:02:47,377 --> 00:02:49,346
You know that we're...

52
00:02:49,807 --> 00:02:51,134
going out on a date today, right?

53
00:02:51,618 --> 00:02:53,485
Yes, of course I know.

54
00:02:53,948 --> 00:02:55,070
But...

55
00:02:55,518 --> 00:02:58,170
after our date, if it doesn't seem right,

56
00:02:58,988 --> 00:03:01,569
we'll just go back to our usual relationship. Okay?

57
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,058
- Of course. - Okay.

58
00:03:04,388 --> 00:03:05,397
I'll see you later then.

59
00:03:05,398 --> 00:03:06,479
Okay.

60
00:03:16,168 --> 00:03:17,637
It's so awkward.

61
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:19,871
I barely even breathed.

62
00:03:21,537 --> 00:03:23,996
I don't know if this is a good idea or not.

63
00:03:30,448 --> 00:03:33,374
That role was supposed to go to me.

64
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,691
I auditioned for that role.

65
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,869
But how could you suddenly cut me out?

66
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,967
I've spent 10 years as a nameless actor.

67
00:03:40,298 --> 00:03:42,236
I thought of this as my last opportunity...

68
00:03:42,268 --> 00:03:44,062
and really devoted my life to it.

69
00:03:44,328 --> 00:03:46,786
Just give me one more chance. I'm begging you.

70
00:03:46,997 --> 00:03:48,119
I'm begging you, sir.

71
00:03:55,648 --> 00:03:57,207
Hey, Jun Ki, get up.

72
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,517
Come on, get up.

73
00:03:58,518 --> 00:04:00,079
Just leave me alone.

74
00:04:00,648 --> 00:04:02,047
Get up.

75
00:04:02,048 --> 00:04:03,517
I told you to get up!

76
00:04:03,518 --> 00:04:04,647
Aren't you going to get up?

77
00:04:04,648 --> 00:04:06,417
Why? What do you want?

78
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:08,786
What's the matter with you? Tell me.

79
00:04:08,787 --> 00:04:10,587
I already told you, I don't want to talk about it.

80
00:04:10,588 --> 00:04:13,310
Hey, didn't you say I'm your best friend?

81
00:04:13,358 --> 00:04:16,326
There shouldn't be any secrets between best friends.

82
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:17,519
Don't you agree?

83
00:04:19,498 --> 00:04:21,267
Fine, then. I will...

84
00:04:21,268 --> 00:04:24,195
tell you all my secrets, so you tell me yours.

85
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:26,060
I'll go first.

86
00:04:27,378 --> 00:04:29,928
When we were in college,

87
00:04:29,977 --> 00:04:32,276
do you remember when we performed in "Romeo and Juliet"?

88
00:04:32,277 --> 00:04:33,440
What about that?

89
00:04:33,777 --> 00:04:37,051
On the day of the performance, during our kissing scene,

90
00:04:38,318 --> 00:04:39,684
do you remember that sound?

91
00:04:40,688 --> 00:04:42,972
I told you it was a sound from the audience.

92
00:04:44,227 --> 00:04:45,557
But it was actually my fart.

93
00:04:45,558 --> 00:04:46,578
I know.

94
00:04:46,657 --> 00:04:48,086
You do? How?

95
00:04:49,527 --> 00:04:51,435
Farts don't just make noises, you know.

96
00:04:52,498 --> 00:04:54,466
Whatever. Just leave if you're going to talk about these things.

97
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:55,590
Fine.

98
00:04:57,838 --> 00:04:59,368
I wasn't going to go this far...

99
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,850
I'm the only one in the world who knows this,

100
00:05:03,607 --> 00:05:05,208
but I'll tell you, all right?

101
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,470
What is it this time?

102
00:05:07,018 --> 00:05:09,741
Do you remember when everyone went crazy...

103
00:05:10,088 --> 00:05:12,873
because there was an adult movie playing on the counter top computer?

104
00:05:14,217 --> 00:05:16,370
- I was the one who was watching it. - I know.

105
00:05:16,657 --> 00:05:17,726
You know that one, too?

106
00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:19,971
I was trying to catch the culprit on the surveillance camera.

107
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,645
You were really into it for three hours straight.

108
00:05:26,297 --> 00:05:28,406
No, I wasn't!

109
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:30,207
It was my first time to see anything like that,

110
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,877
- so I just got curious... - Whatever. Just get out.

111
00:05:32,878 --> 00:05:34,509
Why are you acting like this?

112
00:05:35,177 --> 00:05:37,346
- Just get out. - What's wrong?

113
00:05:37,347 --> 00:05:39,968
- I said to get out. - Jun Ki.

114
00:05:43,248 --> 00:05:45,328
Jun Ki, come on!

115
00:05:45,617 --> 00:05:47,524
Then you have to forget everything I said, all right?

116
00:05:47,818 --> 00:05:49,929
Forget about that adult movie.

117
00:05:50,487 --> 00:05:51,579
Okay?

118
00:05:52,357 --> 00:05:54,060
- You watched an adult movie? - What?

119
00:05:54,998 --> 00:05:56,222
Which one was it?

120
00:05:56,628 --> 00:05:58,882
What was the title?

121
00:06:01,297 --> 00:06:02,461
Gosh...

122
00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:10,445
Who would've thought I'd go on a date with Yu Ri?

123
00:06:13,117 --> 00:06:14,953
This is actually making me nervous.

124
00:06:18,857 --> 00:06:19,938
Ki Bong.

125
00:06:20,888 --> 00:06:22,764
Oh, you're here.

126
00:06:23,357 --> 00:06:25,197
Sorry, I'm a bit late.

127
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:27,034
It's okay, I just arrived.

128
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:29,750
This is so awkward.

129
00:06:31,698 --> 00:06:33,839
It's making me cringe so hard.

130
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:36,810
What should we do?

131
00:06:37,008 --> 00:06:40,608
I don't know. Should we go to Han River and ride bikes?

132
00:06:41,378 --> 00:06:43,112
I'm wearing a skirt.

133
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:46,454
Then let's just go for a walk there.

134
00:06:46,518 --> 00:06:47,741
I'm wearing heels.

135
00:06:48,888 --> 00:06:49,969
Oh, then...

136
00:06:50,188 --> 00:06:51,747
Then how about a cruise?

137
00:06:51,748 --> 00:06:53,389
I get seasick.

138
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,405
Should we go to the arcade?

139
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:00,128
I don't like games.

140
00:07:01,097 --> 00:07:04,697
Why do you keep suggesting everything I hate?

141
00:07:04,698 --> 00:07:07,697
Then you tell me what you want to do.

142
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:11,938
How about we go and watch a movie?

143
00:07:12,237 --> 00:07:15,093
There's a good romantic comedy out.

144
00:07:15,648 --> 00:07:17,406
They're too cheesy for me.

145
00:07:17,407 --> 00:07:18,540
Really?

146
00:07:18,677 --> 00:07:21,046
Should we go and chat at a cafe?

147
00:07:21,047 --> 00:07:22,883
Cafes are too noisy.

148
00:07:23,588 --> 00:07:26,716
- How about shopping? - I hate that more than anything.

149
00:07:26,717 --> 00:07:28,289
Then what do you want me to do?

150
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:29,926
You hate everything, too!

151
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:32,854
What am I supposed to do? You're suggesting the things I hate.

152
00:07:33,797 --> 00:07:35,256
Whatever. I give up.

153
00:07:36,068 --> 00:07:38,197
Let's just head for somewhere.

154
00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:39,932
We're going to be standing here all day.

155
00:07:43,508 --> 00:07:45,242
He's such a bad match for me.

156
00:07:48,847 --> 00:07:50,786
We're starting off all wrong.

157
00:07:57,148 --> 00:07:59,330
I didn't know you liked adult movies, Jung Eun.

158
00:08:00,518 --> 00:08:01,741
When did you start getting into them?

159
00:08:02,157 --> 00:08:04,229
I told you, that was the first time.

160
00:08:04,487 --> 00:08:06,526
It just came on by mistake.

161
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,721
That's weird...

162
00:08:08,097 --> 00:08:12,366
What were you doing for an adult movie to come on?

163
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,521
Stop that, already.

164
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:15,952
All right, I'm just messing with you.

165
00:08:16,138 --> 00:08:19,166
But why were you telling Jun Ki that you like adult movies?

166
00:08:19,438 --> 00:08:22,406
I thought he'd open up and tell me what's wrong...

167
00:08:22,407 --> 00:08:24,111
if I told him my secrets.

168
00:08:24,407 --> 00:08:25,546
Did you really think that would work?

169
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,373
You should've had some drinks with him so that he'd naturally open up.

170
00:08:28,518 --> 00:08:29,639
Drinks?

171
00:08:34,088 --> 00:08:36,886
What are the beers for? You're not even much of a drinker.

172
00:08:36,887 --> 00:08:38,896
I just wanted a drink with my best friend.

173
00:08:38,897 --> 00:08:41,356
Forget it! It's broad daylight.

174
00:08:41,357 --> 00:08:44,019
Don't you know that alcohol tastes better in the daytime?

175
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:47,366
Let's have a drink and talk about all the things...

176
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:49,407
we've been hiding from each other.

177
00:08:49,938 --> 00:08:51,947
Here. Take a can.

178
00:08:57,477 --> 00:08:58,670
Cheers!

179
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:21,753
Now that we're here, what should we do?

180
00:09:22,607 --> 00:09:24,475
I don't know. You choose.

181
00:09:26,178 --> 00:09:27,300
Forget it.

182
00:09:27,908 --> 00:09:30,047
Let's go get something to eat. I'm hungry.

183
00:09:30,048 --> 00:09:31,128
Whatever.

184
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:34,087
- What should we eat? - Anything.

185
00:09:34,548 --> 00:09:37,447
There's a good blood sausage soup place around here. How about there?

186
00:09:37,448 --> 00:09:40,216
What? Blood sausage soup on a first date?

187
00:09:40,217 --> 00:09:41,410
Don't you have anything else in mind?

188
00:09:42,428 --> 00:09:45,283
- How about ox blood soup? - Something else.

189
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,927
Cabbage soup? How about dried pollack soup?

190
00:09:47,928 --> 00:09:50,226
Why do you keep suggesting soup?

191
00:09:50,227 --> 00:09:51,962
Do you only know soup restaurants?

192
00:09:52,237 --> 00:09:54,207
Then you choose!

193
00:09:55,438 --> 00:09:58,506
Let's just have spaghetti, then.

194
00:09:58,507 --> 00:10:01,231
What? We always have spaghetti.

195
00:10:01,678 --> 00:10:04,298
You can have two bowls of blood sausage soup for that price.

196
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:06,168
Sushi?

197
00:10:06,717 --> 00:10:08,788
Sushi's expensive and the portions are small.

198
00:10:09,048 --> 00:10:12,657
That's worth two bowls of soup and a plate of sliced pork.

199
00:10:12,658 --> 00:10:13,787
Then steak?

200
00:10:13,788 --> 00:10:16,338
That's even worse.

201
00:10:16,487 --> 00:10:19,354
That's worth two bowls of soup, a plate of sliced pork,

202
00:10:19,397 --> 00:10:20,989
and even an assortment of blood sausages.

203
00:10:21,127 --> 00:10:25,004
Hey, is that all you ever think about?

204
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:30,444
Forget it. Let's just go to the food court and get our own food.

205
00:10:30,538 --> 00:10:31,894
Fine, then!

206
00:10:34,438 --> 00:10:35,703
It's the worst match ever.

207
00:10:36,007 --> 00:10:37,334
How can it be this bad?

208
00:10:38,308 --> 00:10:39,908
It's the worst match ever.

209
00:10:40,448 --> 00:10:41,601
Nothing matches at all!

210
00:10:42,918 --> 00:10:44,039
Fine.

211
00:10:46,318 --> 00:10:49,448
I was planning on taking this to the grave,

212
00:10:49,788 --> 00:10:52,205
but I'll let you in on this.

213
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,977
- I told you you don't have to. - No.

214
00:10:55,328 --> 00:10:56,858
I'm going to tell you everything.

215
00:10:57,568 --> 00:11:00,290
Why is that? Because we're best friends.

216
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:04,867
Best friends don't keep secrets from each other.

217
00:11:05,237 --> 00:11:07,247
Fine, whatever. What is it?

218
00:11:07,377 --> 00:11:08,602
Jun Ki,

219
00:11:09,507 --> 00:11:10,803
to tell you the truth...

220
00:11:12,477 --> 00:11:14,252
I love adult movies.

221
00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:16,932
I've been watching them since I was little.

222
00:11:17,048 --> 00:11:19,129
I even have an external drive just for my collection.

223
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,182
Eight terabytes.

224
00:11:21,818 --> 00:11:24,745
I'll lend it to you sometime.

225
00:11:24,757 --> 00:11:26,256
Since we're best friends.

226
00:11:26,328 --> 00:11:27,418
Whatever.

227
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,096
Hey! That's it for me.

228
00:11:30,097 --> 00:11:31,353
There's nothing else to tell you.

229
00:11:32,137 --> 00:11:35,136
So come on and tell me.

230
00:11:35,137 --> 00:11:37,236
What in the world happened?

231
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:39,247
I told you, I don't want to talk about it.

232
00:11:40,338 --> 00:11:44,246
Fine. This is supposed to be a secret...

233
00:11:44,247 --> 00:11:46,899
even after I die, but I'll tell you.

234
00:11:46,948 --> 00:11:49,568
In return, after hearing me,

235
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:52,048
you have to tell me too.

236
00:11:54,818 --> 00:11:57,683
Well... The thing is...

237
00:12:04,568 --> 00:12:08,443
He just had to eat that blood sausage soup, didn't he?

238
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:11,286
Is he possessed with some kind of blood sausage ghost?

239
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,422
She just had to eat that spaghetti, didn't she?

240
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,146
Blood sausage soup is so full of nutrients.

241
00:12:17,147 --> 00:12:18,474
Why won't she eat it?

242
00:12:20,147 --> 00:12:21,504
What should we do next?

243
00:12:22,147 --> 00:12:23,311
I don't know.

244
00:12:23,987 --> 00:12:26,027
Should we go in there?

245
00:12:28,088 --> 00:12:31,290
Fine. Let's just do it.

246
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:37,454
Why is she pulling a temper if she's going to agree?

247
00:12:42,438 --> 00:12:46,236
The enemy is headed that way! Where are you aiming at?

248
00:12:46,237 --> 00:12:48,006
You told me to keep guard of this side.

249
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:49,813
Still. Here!

250
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:56,116
- We got killed because of you. - I told you, I'm not good at this.

251
00:12:56,117 --> 00:12:58,259
Besides, you're not even that good yourself.

252
00:12:58,918 --> 00:13:00,216
I'm good when I'm on my own.

253
00:13:00,217 --> 00:13:02,605
Fine! Good for you.

254
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:13,697
Hey, move over!

255
00:13:13,698 --> 00:13:15,396
I can't grab any of the balls because of you.

256
00:13:15,397 --> 00:13:17,937
What are you talking about? You're just too rushed.

257
00:13:17,938 --> 00:13:20,998
Whatever. Just keep throwing. We're running out of time.

258
00:13:21,538 --> 00:13:22,669
Fine.

259
00:13:26,247 --> 00:13:28,677
- Are you all right? - You did that on purpose!

260
00:13:28,678 --> 00:13:29,768
No, I didn't.

261
00:13:30,517 --> 00:13:31,917
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

262
00:13:31,918 --> 00:13:34,611
- Let me take a look. - I'm bleeding.

263
00:13:35,217 --> 00:13:37,386
Why did you put your head up like that?

264
00:13:37,387 --> 00:13:38,989
You shouldn't have been so near me.

265
00:13:39,158 --> 00:13:42,096
- My nose is bleeding. - I am, too.

266
00:13:42,097 --> 00:13:43,658
Gosh.

267
00:13:49,507 --> 00:13:52,159
We're not even good at games together.

268
00:13:53,678 --> 00:13:55,749
What are we even doing?

269
00:13:57,007 --> 00:13:59,669
What should we do next?

270
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:02,441
I don't know.

271
00:14:05,588 --> 00:14:08,576
All that moving made me hungry. Should we get something to eat?

272
00:14:09,588 --> 00:14:10,710
Whatever.

273
00:14:11,487 --> 00:14:12,619
Here.

274
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,827
Why did you put ketchup on it?

275
00:14:15,828 --> 00:14:18,275
- I don't like it on my corndogs. - What?

276
00:14:18,767 --> 00:14:21,537
Then it won't taste like anything.

277
00:14:21,538 --> 00:14:22,937
Do you eat corndogs to taste the ketchup?

278
00:14:22,938 --> 00:14:23,988
I do!

279
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,839
Gosh, we don't have one thing in common.

280
00:14:30,408 --> 00:14:31,529
Hey, Kook Ki Bong.

281
00:14:31,977 --> 00:14:35,109
How do you like your sweet and sour pork?

282
00:14:35,548 --> 00:14:37,658
- Do you pour the sauce or dip it? - I pour it.

283
00:14:38,487 --> 00:14:39,681
I dip it.

284
00:14:40,757 --> 00:14:42,829
Do you like jjajangmyeon or jjamppong?

285
00:14:42,987 --> 00:14:44,150
- Jjajangmyeon. - Jjamppong.

286
00:14:45,727 --> 00:14:47,027
Cold noodles with soup or sauce?

287
00:14:47,028 --> 00:14:48,079
- Soup. - Sauce.

288
00:14:49,127 --> 00:14:50,266
Plain fried chicken or spicy?

289
00:14:50,267 --> 00:14:51,319
- Plain. - Spicy.

290
00:14:52,637 --> 00:14:53,837
Fish-shaped buns, from the head or the tail?

291
00:14:53,838 --> 00:14:54,918
- Head. - Tail.

292
00:14:57,367 --> 00:14:59,857
Forget it. Let's give up.

293
00:15:00,838 --> 00:15:03,907
We're really not a good match.

294
00:15:03,908 --> 00:15:04,928
I know.

295
00:15:05,048 --> 00:15:07,465
I didn't expect us to be such a bad match.

296
00:15:07,747 --> 00:15:09,277
What should we do now?

297
00:15:10,288 --> 00:15:11,674
Should we just go home?

298
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:13,538
Let's do that.

299
00:15:17,658 --> 00:15:18,748
Where are you going?

300
00:15:19,158 --> 00:15:20,555
- The bus stop is... - The bus stop is...

301
00:15:29,338 --> 00:15:30,429
Gosh, my head.

302
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:37,790
Why was I sleeping here?

303
00:15:40,347 --> 00:15:42,357
Woo Shik, what happened?

304
00:15:42,418 --> 00:15:44,616
Oh, our movie fan is up.

305
00:15:44,617 --> 00:15:46,386
What? "Movie fan"?

306
00:15:46,387 --> 00:15:48,427
You're an adult movie fan.

307
00:15:48,717 --> 00:15:50,027
You even store all the movies...

308
00:15:50,028 --> 00:15:51,927
in your 8TB external hard drive, sorted by rating.

309
00:15:51,928 --> 00:15:53,797
What? How do you know that?

310
00:15:53,798 --> 00:15:56,113
You came out here and said it yourself.

311
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:59,591
You've loved adult movies since you were a kid.

312
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:01,636
You're even a member...

313
00:16:01,637 --> 00:16:03,341
of an adult movie fan club.

314
00:16:03,737 --> 00:16:05,876
What? I said that too?

315
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:07,162
Yes, you did.

316
00:16:07,578 --> 00:16:09,277
From now on, you should be called 8TB.

317
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:10,501
8TB Jung Eun.

318
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:12,845
I must have been out of my mind.

319
00:16:14,048 --> 00:16:15,138
By the way,

320
00:16:15,418 --> 00:16:17,317
is that really true?

321
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:19,917
What do you mean? What else did I say?

322
00:16:19,918 --> 00:16:21,008
You don't remember?

323
00:16:21,257 --> 00:16:22,427
You said you once had feelings for Jun Ki.

324
00:16:22,428 --> 00:16:24,121
What? Wait.

325
00:16:24,158 --> 00:16:25,386
This...

326
00:16:25,387 --> 00:16:28,416
is supposed to be a secret even after I die,

327
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,405
but I'll tell you. In return,

328
00:16:30,727 --> 00:16:32,022
after hearing it,

329
00:16:32,997 --> 00:16:34,527
you have to tell me too.

330
00:16:37,668 --> 00:16:38,729
Well...

331
00:16:39,237 --> 00:16:40,502
The thing is...

332
00:16:50,387 --> 00:16:51,816
I had feelings for you.

333
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,856
What? What did you say?

334
00:16:56,857 --> 00:16:58,827
I once had feelings for you.

335
00:17:00,357 --> 00:17:02,877
I used to only see you as a friend,

336
00:17:04,397 --> 00:17:08,141
but at some point, I started seeing you as a man.

337
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:12,385
You had no idea.

338
00:17:14,137 --> 00:17:15,402
You're a jerk.

339
00:17:16,808 --> 00:17:18,204
You're such a jerk!

340
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:20,869
Whatever.

341
00:17:25,117 --> 00:17:26,922
What did I say that?

342
00:17:27,357 --> 00:17:28,438
Gosh.

343
00:17:29,457 --> 00:17:32,287
Woo Shik, please don't tell anyone, okay?

344
00:17:32,288 --> 00:17:33,349
It's too late.

345
00:17:33,697 --> 00:17:35,972
You were crying and making a scene.

346
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:38,338
Even the lady from the snack bar came over.

347
00:17:38,427 --> 00:17:39,696
Everyone in the neighborhood knows it now.

348
00:17:39,697 --> 00:17:40,717
What?

349
00:17:41,097 --> 00:17:43,556
This is crazy.

350
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:44,989
Gosh.

351
00:17:51,008 --> 00:17:53,975
I just wasted my time. I should have taken a nap instead.

352
00:17:56,187 --> 00:17:58,587
I should have just worked.

353
00:17:58,588 --> 00:18:00,251
What's the point of this date?

354
00:18:05,088 --> 00:18:06,117
Toy vending machines.

355
00:18:12,068 --> 00:18:13,261
There it is.

356
00:18:14,268 --> 00:18:15,869
Let me see.

357
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:17,765
What are you doing?

358
00:18:18,637 --> 00:18:20,167
Let me try this for a second.

359
00:18:20,207 --> 00:18:21,906
I've collected every figure in this series...

360
00:18:21,907 --> 00:18:23,641
except this panda.

361
00:18:25,107 --> 00:18:27,157
Please let me get it.

362
00:18:27,347 --> 00:18:28,469
Panda, panda!

363
00:18:30,518 --> 00:18:32,587
Why are you so childish?

364
00:18:32,588 --> 00:18:34,526
(Insert 2 50-cent coins.)

365
00:18:39,697 --> 00:18:41,666
Wait. Why isn't anything coming out?

366
00:18:46,468 --> 00:18:47,794
What are you doing?

367
00:18:48,338 --> 00:18:50,142
Why are you sticking your hand in there?

368
00:18:50,968 --> 00:18:53,706
I inserted coins into this machine, but I didn't get any toy.

369
00:18:53,707 --> 00:18:56,257
What are you talking about? That has never happened before.

370
00:18:56,508 --> 00:18:59,272
Are you sure you didn't insert fake coins?

371
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,217
I didn't.

372
00:19:01,218 --> 00:19:04,146
Do you have proof that you inserted coins?

373
00:19:04,147 --> 00:19:05,473
Do you?

374
00:19:05,788 --> 00:19:08,217
You don't, do you? Then just leave.

375
00:19:08,218 --> 00:19:09,727
This machine is expensive.

376
00:19:09,728 --> 00:19:12,512
I swear I inserted coins.

377
00:19:13,197 --> 00:19:15,400
Yu Ri, let's go.

378
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:18,391
We're not going yet.

379
00:19:20,437 --> 00:19:21,519
Sir.

380
00:19:21,937 --> 00:19:23,537
I saw him insert coins into that machine.

381
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,936
So give him his money back.

382
00:19:25,937 --> 00:19:28,077
Why should I trust you?

383
00:19:28,078 --> 00:19:30,597
- Do you have proof? - Of course.

384
00:19:31,008 --> 00:19:32,646
You could check the dashcam footage...

385
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:34,381
from the cars parked around here.

386
00:19:34,778 --> 00:19:37,470
If there is proof, what are you going to do?

387
00:19:37,647 --> 00:19:38,739
What?

388
00:19:38,818 --> 00:19:40,087
You're much younger than me.

389
00:19:40,088 --> 00:19:42,229
How dare you talk back to me?

390
00:19:43,627 --> 00:19:46,412
I'm just telling you what happened. Why would you bring up my age?

391
00:19:46,998 --> 00:19:50,058
Can't young people say anything even if something unfair happens?

392
00:19:50,468 --> 00:19:51,767
What?

393
00:19:51,768 --> 00:19:53,329
- She's so cool. - Then...

394
00:19:53,538 --> 00:19:55,767
let's call the police and check...

395
00:19:55,768 --> 00:19:57,537
the dashcam footage from the cars around here.

396
00:19:57,538 --> 00:19:59,206
- She's so smart. - If we find proof,

397
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:01,406
we will sue you for theft and defamation.

398
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,446
- She's so confident. - We'll also demand...

399
00:20:03,447 --> 00:20:05,577
compensation for the mental damage.

400
00:20:05,578 --> 00:20:06,771
She's really attractive.

401
00:20:09,048 --> 00:20:11,487
Well, do you want to call the police or not?

402
00:20:11,488 --> 00:20:13,528
Fine.

403
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:15,251
I'll pay you.

404
00:20:15,518 --> 00:20:16,914
I will. Here.

405
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:19,578
Gosh.

406
00:20:20,228 --> 00:20:21,655
Finally.

407
00:20:23,298 --> 00:20:24,349
Here.

408
00:20:29,508 --> 00:20:31,007
Why do you always let people...

409
00:20:31,008 --> 00:20:33,119
walk all over you?

410
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:35,374
That's why people look down on you.

411
00:20:38,147 --> 00:20:40,290
What are you doing? Let's go home.

412
00:20:40,578 --> 00:20:41,638
Well...

413
00:20:41,947 --> 00:20:43,681
Okay. Let's go.

414
00:21:08,738 --> 00:21:09,906
Why are you glancing at me?

415
00:21:09,907 --> 00:21:10,927
What?

416
00:21:11,707 --> 00:21:12,870
Nothing.

417
00:21:15,847 --> 00:21:16,908
My scarf!

418
00:21:18,748 --> 00:21:20,686
It's my favorite one.

419
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:22,524
Really? Just a second.

420
00:21:25,187 --> 00:21:27,135
Hey. What are you doing?

421
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,031
It's your favorite scarf.

422
00:21:43,748 --> 00:21:44,768
Yu Ri!

423
00:21:46,478 --> 00:21:47,701
He's amazing.

424
00:21:50,048 --> 00:21:51,343
He's so thoughtful.

425
00:21:53,758 --> 00:21:54,940
He's so kind.

426
00:21:58,927 --> 00:22:00,356
He's attractive.

427
00:22:05,097 --> 00:22:06,158
Here you go.

428
00:22:06,768 --> 00:22:08,369
Thanks.

429
00:22:09,407 --> 00:22:11,682
Your pants got wet.

430
00:22:12,407 --> 00:22:13,937
It's no big deal. I'll just wash them.

431
00:22:14,508 --> 00:22:15,629
Let's go.

432
00:22:32,528 --> 00:22:34,027
Jun Ki, are you sleeping?

433
00:22:35,357 --> 00:22:36,796
Jun Ki.

434
00:22:37,127 --> 00:22:38,932
The thing I said earlier...

435
00:22:39,228 --> 00:22:41,003
It's all in the past now.

436
00:22:41,897 --> 00:22:44,591
It's not like that anymore, so please don't feel uncomfortable.

437
00:22:44,808 --> 00:22:46,980
- Okay? - I get it, so just leave.

438
00:22:47,008 --> 00:22:48,129
I'm tired.

439
00:22:48,907 --> 00:22:51,747
Hey, I told you all my secrets.

440
00:22:51,748 --> 00:22:53,376
Aren't you going to tell me what this is about?

441
00:22:53,377 --> 00:22:55,795
Just leave me alone.

442
00:22:56,218 --> 00:22:58,217
Fine, forget it.

443
00:22:58,218 --> 00:23:00,461
Best friends, my foot.

444
00:23:00,818 --> 00:23:02,797
You're not my friend anymore.

445
00:23:05,228 --> 00:23:06,248
Let go.

446
00:23:10,627 --> 00:23:11,696
Do you really have to know?

447
00:23:11,697 --> 00:23:13,371
Yes, I do.

448
00:23:13,397 --> 00:23:15,666
I can't help you unless you tell me what the problem is.

449
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:17,779
After hearing it, you have to leave me alone.

450
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:20,853
Fine. Just tell me.

451
00:23:24,147 --> 00:23:25,912
It's about the movie audition...

452
00:23:27,078 --> 00:23:28,444
I recently passed.

453
00:23:28,647 --> 00:23:30,446
What about it?

454
00:23:30,447 --> 00:23:31,611
Apparently,

455
00:23:33,588 --> 00:23:36,443
Hyun Sung asked the director to cast me.

456
00:23:36,728 --> 00:23:37,910
Really?

457
00:23:39,657 --> 00:23:41,738
But it has nothing to do with you.

458
00:23:41,897 --> 00:23:43,096
You didn't know about it.

459
00:23:43,097 --> 00:23:44,219
I did.

460
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,694
I knew about it,

461
00:23:46,897 --> 00:23:48,571
but I thought it was okay...

462
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:51,874
because everyone else does that too.

463
00:23:52,637 --> 00:23:55,535
I ignored the fact because I wanted the opportunity so badly.

464
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:58,041
But someone came to the director.

465
00:23:58,447 --> 00:23:59,517
Who?

466
00:23:59,518 --> 00:24:01,007
The person who originally got that part.

467
00:24:02,578 --> 00:24:04,077
He said it was unfair, crying.

468
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:08,244
He begged the director to tell him why he lost his part.

469
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:12,764
Just like I did in the past.

470
00:24:13,697 --> 00:24:16,381
After losing my part to Hyun Sung, I was devastated.

471
00:24:16,927 --> 00:24:19,794
And I did the same to that man...

472
00:24:21,097 --> 00:24:23,046
when I know how painful and frustrating it is...

473
00:24:25,068 --> 00:24:26,740
more than anyone else.

474
00:24:28,078 --> 00:24:29,098
Still,

475
00:24:29,947 --> 00:24:32,191
it doesn't mean you have to quit acting.

476
00:24:32,677 --> 00:24:34,616
It was just a mistake.

477
00:24:34,947 --> 00:24:35,999
A mistake?

478
00:24:36,818 --> 00:24:38,928
But I can't forgive myself for that mistake.

479
00:24:39,957 --> 00:24:41,855
I don't deserve to be an actor.

480
00:24:43,387 --> 00:24:44,426
Are you happy now?

481
00:24:44,427 --> 00:24:46,626
Can you leave now?

482
00:24:46,627 --> 00:24:47,821
I'm feeling tired.

483
00:25:00,338 --> 00:25:03,162
Then is it over between Yu Ri and me?

484
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,571
She probably thinks she and I aren't a good match.

485
00:25:07,248 --> 00:25:09,798
Is this it for Ki Bong and me?

486
00:25:10,687 --> 00:25:15,002
Ki Bong probably thinks he and I aren't a good match at all.

487
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:22,802
I love the breeze. Don't you?

488
00:25:23,328 --> 00:25:24,418
Yes.

489
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:27,382
I like walking at night and enjoying the breeze too.

490
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:31,505
You do? At least we have one thing in common.

491
00:25:31,968 --> 00:25:33,130
I guess.

492
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:37,730
Hey, Yu Ri.

493
00:25:39,177 --> 00:25:41,727
I only like cool breezes like this.

494
00:25:42,117 --> 00:25:44,494
I don't like strong winds that make me cold.

495
00:25:45,018 --> 00:25:47,230
- What about you? - What?

496
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,811
- I don't like that either. - Really?

497
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:53,581
We have another thing in common.

498
00:25:55,097 --> 00:25:56,227
How about when it's hot?

499
00:25:56,228 --> 00:25:59,940
I really hate it when it's scorching hot and I get all sweaty.

500
00:26:00,298 --> 00:26:01,828
- What about you? - Me too.

501
00:26:02,238 --> 00:26:04,106
Then Ki Bong, what about this?

502
00:26:04,107 --> 00:26:07,307
I really hate it when it's cold and I'm about to freeze to death.

503
00:26:07,308 --> 00:26:08,664
- What about you? - This is amazing.

504
00:26:08,778 --> 00:26:10,339
I really hate it when it's cold too.

505
00:26:10,578 --> 00:26:13,277
Do you get hungry too if you don't eat for two days?

506
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:14,446
Of course.

507
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,456
You too? I just got chills.

508
00:26:17,518 --> 00:26:21,536
Gosh, I thought you and I weren't a good match at all.

509
00:26:21,887 --> 00:26:24,132
- But we have many things in common. - I know.

510
00:26:25,328 --> 00:26:26,449
Yu Ri.

511
00:26:28,127 --> 00:26:31,392
Then do you want to date a little more?

512
00:26:31,968 --> 00:26:33,936
For another week, maybe?

513
00:26:34,437 --> 00:26:35,560
Shall we?

514
00:26:36,367 --> 00:26:39,468
But will one week cut it?

515
00:26:39,907 --> 00:26:43,446
Don't you think we should date for about a month...

516
00:26:43,707 --> 00:26:46,533
to see if we're really meant to be?

517
00:26:47,518 --> 00:26:48,599
You're right.

518
00:26:51,417 --> 00:26:53,936
Then is today the first day...

519
00:26:54,758 --> 00:26:56,319
we start seeing each other?

520
00:26:56,357 --> 00:26:57,918
I think so.

521
00:26:58,127 --> 00:27:00,238
Then we're a couple now.

522
00:27:01,058 --> 00:27:03,577
Can I hold your hand?

523
00:27:04,097 --> 00:27:05,219
Well...

524
00:27:05,728 --> 00:27:06,920
I think you can.

525
00:27:17,048 --> 00:27:19,250
- Let's go. - Okay, let's go.

526
00:27:50,847 --> 00:27:52,337
Did you sleep well, Yu Ri?

527
00:27:52,877 --> 00:27:55,733
- Yes. Did you sleep well? - Yes.

528
00:27:56,488 --> 00:27:59,517
I can't believe we met now. I didn't even wash my face.

529
00:27:59,518 --> 00:28:01,599
- This is embarrassing. - You still look pretty.

530
00:28:02,818 --> 00:28:03,886
What?

531
00:28:03,887 --> 00:28:05,386
You look pretty even if you don't wash your face.

532
00:28:05,758 --> 00:28:07,827
Don't be silly. You're making me cringe.

533
00:28:07,828 --> 00:28:09,896
I just stated a fact. What's wrong with that?

534
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,906
Stop it. Are you crazy?

535
00:28:12,528 --> 00:28:13,762
I am crazy.

536
00:28:16,437 --> 00:28:17,529
Crazy over you.

537
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:20,406
Oh, gosh. What's the matter with you?

538
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,232
I was just kidding. Stop hitting me.

539
00:28:23,447 --> 00:28:25,039
- You're so cute. - Move!

540
00:28:29,048 --> 00:28:30,747
- What's up with her? - I know.

541
00:28:30,748 --> 00:28:32,446
What's wrong with her so early in the morning?

542
00:28:32,447 --> 00:28:33,580
Jun Ki, get up.

543
00:28:34,258 --> 00:28:35,543
What is it this time?

544
00:28:35,758 --> 00:28:37,695
You said you won't bother me anymore.

545
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:40,104
We have somewhere to go, so get your butt up!

546
00:28:40,828 --> 00:28:43,567
Go where? I'm tired, so get out.

547
00:28:43,568 --> 00:28:45,199
I said, get up!

548
00:28:48,338 --> 00:28:50,378
Fine. Stay there like that.

549
00:28:52,308 --> 00:28:54,990
What's the matter with you? Just leave me alone!

550
00:28:56,107 --> 00:28:58,147
Follow me. Come over here.

551
00:29:02,718 --> 00:29:03,910
Come on!

552
00:29:04,288 --> 00:29:05,846
Why are we here?

553
00:29:05,847 --> 00:29:07,017
Just follow me.

554
00:29:07,018 --> 00:29:08,649
What is this about?

555
00:29:10,187 --> 00:29:11,310
What?

556
00:29:18,897 --> 00:29:20,265
- Hey, what... - Jun Ki.

557
00:29:21,068 --> 00:29:23,791
Before you think about forgiving yourself,

558
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:28,002
shouldn't you ask him for forgiveness first?

559
00:29:28,778 --> 00:29:30,134
At least, that's what I think.

560
00:29:32,478 --> 00:29:33,946
I'll be waiting outside.

561
00:29:34,478 --> 00:29:36,793
Hey, Jung Eun. Jung Eun.

563
00:29:51,627 --> 00:29:52,922
Excuse me.

564
00:29:54,768 --> 00:29:56,879
- Who are you? - Hello.

565
00:29:57,437 --> 00:29:58,936
My name is Lee Jun Ki.

566
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:02,069
Yes, can I help you?

567
00:30:02,308 --> 00:30:03,429
Well...

568
00:30:04,578 --> 00:30:06,138
The thing is...

569
00:30:10,347 --> 00:30:11,847
So that's what happened.

570
00:30:13,818 --> 00:30:14,980
I'm really sorry.

571
00:30:15,617 --> 00:30:18,442
I know it's late, but I wanted to tell you the truth...

572
00:30:19,187 --> 00:30:20,789
and ask for forgiveness.

573
00:30:20,897 --> 00:30:22,326
To be honest, I do feel angry.

574
00:30:22,657 --> 00:30:25,992
But I don't know if I have the right to forgive you.

575
00:30:26,768 --> 00:30:29,297
What? What do you mean?

576
00:30:29,298 --> 00:30:31,583
If I received the same offer,

577
00:30:32,137 --> 00:30:33,607
would I have been able to refuse?

578
00:30:34,838 --> 00:30:37,734
To be honest, I'm not sure if I'll be able to say no to that.

579
00:30:40,877 --> 00:30:42,275
Still, I'm sorry.

580
00:30:43,018 --> 00:30:44,210
Please forgive me.

581
00:30:44,748 --> 00:30:46,899
If that's what you really want, I'll forgive you.

582
00:30:47,157 --> 00:30:51,268
But I can't forgive you if you'll give up on acting...

583
00:30:51,387 --> 00:30:52,510
because of something like this.

584
00:30:53,088 --> 00:30:54,827
- Sorry? - Jun Ki.

585
00:30:54,828 --> 00:30:58,438
We're not people who act to become stars, are we?

586
00:30:59,427 --> 00:31:01,335
We just love acting and enjoy it.

587
00:31:01,538 --> 00:31:02,793
Isn't that why we do it?

588
00:31:03,367 --> 00:31:07,356
If you give up something you love so much because of this,

589
00:31:07,877 --> 00:31:09,265
isn't that being too harsh on yourself?

590
00:31:10,048 --> 00:31:13,240
Or is it because you don't like acting as much as me?

591
00:31:14,548 --> 00:31:16,761
No, I like acting.

592
00:31:17,748 --> 00:31:19,788
I really love acting.

593
00:31:20,657 --> 00:31:21,912
Then I'll forgive you.

594
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:25,037
Instead, I have a favor to ask you.

595
00:31:26,758 --> 00:31:28,329
A favor?

596
00:31:28,728 --> 00:31:33,053
(Sunshine Theater)

597
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,164
Jun Ki, how did it go?

598
00:31:37,707 --> 00:31:40,007
I told him everything honestly, and he forgave me.

599
00:31:40,008 --> 00:31:42,149
Really? I'm so glad.

600
00:31:42,978 --> 00:31:44,539
Then what will you do now?

601
00:31:44,877 --> 00:31:46,510
Are you really going to quit acting?

602
00:31:46,578 --> 00:31:47,903
I was about to...

603
00:31:48,778 --> 00:31:51,398
but the situation turned out to be rather odd.

604
00:31:52,018 --> 00:31:54,129
- What do you mean? - In return for forgiving me,

605
00:31:54,657 --> 00:31:56,187
he wants me to perform in a play with him.

606
00:31:56,357 --> 00:31:57,786
He has a play coming up,

607
00:31:57,857 --> 00:31:59,926
but his colleague was injured and there's an empty spot.

608
00:31:59,927 --> 00:32:01,557
So? Will you do it?

609
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:04,484
I have no choice. He'll only forgive me if I do it.

610
00:32:05,468 --> 00:32:09,170
I'll do it and try to remember how I felt when I first started.

611
00:32:09,738 --> 00:32:12,460
I think I forgot how I truly felt when I first started acting.

612
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:14,646
I just wanted to be a star, and my greed got the better of me.

613
00:32:15,008 --> 00:32:17,730
I think I forgot what was the most important.

614
00:32:19,107 --> 00:32:22,517
You know, when we were in college, we even built our own stage.

615
00:32:22,518 --> 00:32:24,916
We enjoyed acting even when there was no audience.

616
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:27,335
I'll start over, thinking back of those days.

617
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:29,287
You made the right choice.

618
00:32:29,288 --> 00:32:31,735
Thank you. It's all thanks to you.

619
00:32:32,427 --> 00:32:35,008
I feel so reassured with my best friend next to me.

620
00:32:35,298 --> 00:32:37,674
I knew you would. So you better be good to me.

621
00:32:37,828 --> 00:32:38,918
Okay.

622
00:32:39,298 --> 00:32:40,491
Let's go, my friend.

623
00:32:40,768 --> 00:32:42,369
Today's tteokbokki is on me!

624
00:32:42,538 --> 00:32:43,934
- Okay. - Oh, right.

625
00:32:44,768 --> 00:32:46,849
There was something I wanted to ask you.

626
00:32:47,538 --> 00:32:48,700
Can you tell me...

627
00:32:49,778 --> 00:32:52,838
- why you liked me so much? - What?

628
00:32:52,947 --> 00:32:54,446
You said you used to like me.

629
00:32:54,647 --> 00:32:56,477
So what was the particular reason that you liked me?

630
00:32:56,478 --> 00:32:58,660
It was all in the past. I don't like you now.

631
00:32:58,718 --> 00:33:01,116
Then when you saw me back then,

632
00:33:01,117 --> 00:33:03,301
did you feel nervous and blush and stuff?

633
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:05,367
- Stop it. - Why?

634
00:33:05,488 --> 00:33:07,196
Does it make you embarrassed...

635
00:33:07,197 --> 00:33:08,931
and does your heart bounce just by thinking about it?

636
00:33:09,528 --> 00:33:11,434
Come here, you're dead.

637
00:33:11,597 --> 00:33:12,648
Come here.

638
00:33:13,568 --> 00:33:16,494
Did your heart really bounce? Bounce, bounce.

639
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:18,159
Hey!

640
00:33:24,847 --> 00:33:27,633
Gonguri, what are you to me?

641
00:33:27,718 --> 00:33:30,574
I'm just a lowly clown, Your Highness.

642
00:33:31,147 --> 00:33:33,942
No. You are my friend.

643
00:33:34,357 --> 00:33:35,717
A man who is my friend.

644
00:33:35,718 --> 00:33:37,390
In short, shall I call you a male friend?

645
00:33:37,657 --> 00:33:40,027
No, sir. How dare could I be your friend?

646
00:33:40,028 --> 00:33:42,027
All right, let's skip the chitchat.

647
00:33:42,028 --> 00:33:44,720
- Show me your dance now. - Yes, Your Highness.

648
00:33:52,137 --> 00:33:55,503
Nakyang, Dongcheon, Leehwajung

649
00:34:01,347 --> 00:34:02,642
Time out, Jun Ki.

650
00:34:03,488 --> 00:34:05,150
What's wrong?

651
00:34:05,248 --> 00:34:07,023
Your dancing seems kind of awkward.

652
00:34:07,457 --> 00:34:10,589
Actually, I was busy lately,

653
00:34:10,787 --> 00:34:12,797
and I didn't get much practice.

654
00:34:13,497 --> 00:34:15,874
- I'm really sorry. - It's okay.

655
00:34:15,997 --> 00:34:19,089
We have a lot of time until the performance, so let's take our time.

656
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:21,277
Why don't we call it a day...

657
00:34:21,397 --> 00:34:23,611
- and go get a drink? - A drink?

658
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:27,237
I quit drinking lately.

659
00:34:27,238 --> 00:34:29,420
- Really? Why? - Why?

660
00:34:31,008 --> 00:34:33,934
In order to focus more on my acting.

661
00:34:33,977 --> 00:34:35,170
Too bad, then.

662
00:34:35,548 --> 00:34:38,750
- I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay. Goodbye, sir.

663
00:34:43,528 --> 00:34:45,293
I can't stand this anymore.

664
00:34:45,988 --> 00:34:47,049
What do I do?

665
00:34:49,028 --> 00:34:55,423
(The Scar Deeper Than Love)

666
00:35:01,077 --> 00:35:03,423
Oh, no. You got hemorrhoids again.

667
00:35:04,048 --> 00:35:06,189
Why didn't you come earlier?

668
00:35:07,118 --> 00:35:08,342
I...

669
00:35:09,218 --> 00:35:11,226
just had some things going on in my life,

670
00:35:11,588 --> 00:35:13,280
so I had a lot to drink.

671
00:35:14,017 --> 00:35:16,416
Is it that bad?

672
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:17,886
Not only is it bad,

673
00:35:18,287 --> 00:35:20,257
if you keep this up,

674
00:35:20,258 --> 00:35:22,164
you're going to have to get a colostomy.

675
00:35:22,698 --> 00:35:23,953
A colostomy?

676
00:35:24,928 --> 00:35:27,867
Sir, what can I do?

677
00:35:27,868 --> 00:35:29,908
I'll prescribe you some ointment.

678
00:35:30,138 --> 00:35:32,867
Don't walk around and make sure to apply it regularly.

679
00:35:32,868 --> 00:35:35,777
Don't forget to take a sitz bath three times a day.

680
00:35:35,778 --> 00:35:36,828
Do you understand?

681
00:35:36,977 --> 00:35:38,202
Yes, sir.

682
00:35:41,048 --> 00:35:42,139
I'm so tired.

683
00:35:42,948 --> 00:35:44,681
I should drink a cold glass of...

684
00:35:50,187 --> 00:35:51,758
I guess she's really tired.

685
00:35:52,588 --> 00:35:54,902
What if she catches a cold?

686
00:36:24,488 --> 00:36:25,549
Woo Shik.

687
00:36:26,388 --> 00:36:27,478
Did I wake you?

688
00:36:27,698 --> 00:36:28,982
I just came to get some water.

689
00:36:29,258 --> 00:36:30,522
Oh, I see.

690
00:36:33,698 --> 00:36:35,228
How did this...

691
00:36:36,098 --> 00:36:38,310
I just...

692
00:36:38,908 --> 00:36:41,223
got worried that you'd catch a cold.

693
00:36:42,577 --> 00:36:44,995
- Thanks. - Don't mention it.

694
00:36:45,247 --> 00:36:47,246
You should go in and get some sleep.

695
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:48,547
I wish I could,

696
00:36:48,548 --> 00:36:50,588
but I need to prepare for the shoot.

697
00:36:53,147 --> 00:36:55,186
I should get some coffee.

698
00:36:55,187 --> 00:36:57,227
Coffee? I'll make you some. You just take a rest.

699
00:36:57,227 --> 00:36:58,757
It's all right. I can do it.

700
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,297
Don't worry.

701
00:37:00,298 --> 00:37:01,888
I was going to make some, anyway.

702
00:37:02,158 --> 00:37:03,178
It'll only take a minute.

703
00:37:18,548 --> 00:37:20,313
- Careful! - Careful.

704
00:37:21,917 --> 00:37:22,998
Gosh, that was heavy.

705
00:37:26,247 --> 00:37:28,125
I said I'd carry it for you.

706
00:37:28,357 --> 00:37:30,979
It's all right. It's too much to handle on your own.

707
00:37:31,088 --> 00:37:32,587
You did great today, Ki Bong.

708
00:37:32,588 --> 00:37:33,996
I didn't even do anything.

709
00:37:33,997 --> 00:37:35,996
You were the one who did a great job cooking all day.

710
00:37:35,997 --> 00:37:38,619
You and your words.

711
00:37:38,868 --> 00:37:39,896
Come on.

712
00:37:39,897 --> 00:37:41,060
Come on.

713
00:37:41,068 --> 00:37:42,464
- Wait a minute. - Why?

714
00:37:43,267 --> 00:37:44,460
You're sweating.

715
00:37:44,968 --> 00:37:46,007
Here, too.

716
00:37:46,008 --> 00:37:47,976
- Here, too. - And here, too.

717
00:37:49,008 --> 00:37:50,058
What are you doing?

718
00:37:52,807 --> 00:37:53,869
What was that?

719
00:37:56,048 --> 00:37:57,241
Disgusting!

720
00:37:57,588 --> 00:37:59,416
What kind of person sweats this much?

721
00:37:59,417 --> 00:38:00,478
You stink.

722
00:38:00,718 --> 00:38:02,416
You do the rest! Okay?

723
00:38:02,417 --> 00:38:03,785
Yes, ma'am.

724
00:38:06,588 --> 00:38:08,943
What's her problem?

725
00:38:08,957 --> 00:38:11,243
She may be my sister, but her temper's unbelievable.

726
00:38:11,767 --> 00:38:13,297
Ki Bong, just leave it.

727
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,797
It's all right.

728
00:38:15,798 --> 00:38:18,214
You're just too soft.

729
00:38:19,968 --> 00:38:20,997
Oh, gosh.

730
00:38:23,077 --> 00:38:24,200
I'm home.

731
00:38:25,477 --> 00:38:26,646
You're late.

732
00:38:26,647 --> 00:38:27,916
The practice session ran late.

733
00:38:27,917 --> 00:38:30,162
What's up with that look?

734
00:38:30,747 --> 00:38:32,828
I just had a hard time practicing.

735
00:38:34,158 --> 00:38:35,280
I'll be up in my room.

736
00:38:40,357 --> 00:38:42,876
Is he still down in the dumps?

737
00:38:43,397 --> 00:38:44,591
I don't think so.

738
00:38:44,827 --> 00:38:47,237
Jung Eun told me that he got over it.

739
00:38:47,238 --> 00:38:48,319
That's weird.

740
00:38:55,937 --> 00:38:57,478
My butt...

741
00:39:00,077 --> 00:39:01,302
Let me get some ointment on.

742
00:39:01,917 --> 00:39:03,957
(Hemorrhoids Ointment)

743
00:39:04,088 --> 00:39:05,108
Hold on.

744
00:39:06,417 --> 00:39:07,539
Gosh.

745
00:39:08,357 --> 00:39:11,417
They're going to make so much fun of me if they find out about this.

746
00:39:11,928 --> 00:39:12,978
What do I do?

747
00:39:14,698 --> 00:39:16,126
I should lock the door first.

748
00:39:26,037 --> 00:39:28,690
What is that noise?

749
00:39:40,017 --> 00:39:42,262
Is he crying?

750
00:39:43,017 --> 00:39:44,149
What's wrong with him?

751
00:39:45,857 --> 00:39:47,591
It hurts...

752
00:39:48,298 --> 00:39:50,746
I can't sleep because it hurts so much.

753
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:52,618
Hold on.

754
00:39:53,068 --> 00:39:55,179
What if I really do have to get a colostomy?

755
00:39:56,368 --> 00:39:58,510
That can't happen.

756
00:40:07,178 --> 00:40:10,317
What? Jun Ki was up crying in the middle of the night?

757
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:11,487
That's what I'm telling you!

758
00:40:11,488 --> 00:40:14,286
He was sobbing so hard that I couldn't bear to talk to him.

759
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,665
But Jun Ki got over it.

760
00:40:16,718 --> 00:40:17,726
Maybe it's something else?

761
00:40:17,727 --> 00:40:19,587
Do you think it's because of his acting?

762
00:40:19,588 --> 00:40:21,975
Jun Ki said he was having a hard time yesterday.

763
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:23,149
That might be it.

764
00:40:23,327 --> 00:40:25,197
He's been trying really hard,

765
00:40:25,198 --> 00:40:27,584
but if it doesn't work out, he could be distressed.

766
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:29,194
Maybe...

767
00:40:29,537 --> 00:40:30,792
he has depression?

768
00:40:30,937 --> 00:40:32,397
What? Depression?

769
00:40:32,767 --> 00:40:35,592
I don't think it fits him, though.

770
00:40:35,638 --> 00:40:37,065
How would you know?

771
00:40:37,178 --> 00:40:39,963
Even the brightest person can get depression.

772
00:40:40,348 --> 00:40:41,976
It's an illness of the mind,

773
00:40:41,977 --> 00:40:44,047
so it's not easy to notice it.

774
00:40:44,048 --> 00:40:46,740
Depression is really horrible. What do we do?

775
00:40:49,857 --> 00:40:51,459
Are you up, Jun Ki?

776
00:40:51,857 --> 00:40:52,877
How about breakfast?

777
00:40:53,127 --> 00:40:54,556
I don't feel like eating.

778
00:40:55,497 --> 00:40:57,088
I'll just have a glass of water.

779
00:41:06,037 --> 00:41:07,201
What do we do?

780
00:41:07,607 --> 00:41:09,106
He doesn't even feel like eating.

781
00:41:10,107 --> 00:41:11,811
Do you really think it's depression?

782
00:41:13,877 --> 00:41:14,969
Hello.

783
00:41:16,417 --> 00:41:17,877
Why are you here again?

784
00:41:18,247 --> 00:41:21,929
I was just having trouble with the song.

785
00:41:21,988 --> 00:41:23,651
Could you help me out?

786
00:41:24,727 --> 00:41:26,594
Sure. Let's go.

787
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,911
Ki Bong. Don't you think...

788
00:41:35,298 --> 00:41:37,409
Min Ah still has feelings for Woo Shik?

789
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:38,867
What are you talking about?

790
00:41:38,868 --> 00:41:41,459
She keeps making excuses to come over...

791
00:41:41,537 --> 00:41:44,301
and the way she looks at him seems a bit suspicious.

792
00:41:44,577 --> 00:41:45,802
Don't you think so, Soo Yeon?

793
00:41:46,348 --> 00:41:47,368
What?

794
00:41:48,178 --> 00:41:50,288
Well, I'm not really sure...

795
00:41:50,618 --> 00:41:52,525
I'll be in my room, resting.

796
00:41:56,787 --> 00:41:58,358
What's wrong with her?

797
00:41:59,327 --> 00:42:00,450
That's fishy.

798
00:42:01,158 --> 00:42:02,226
What about Soo Yeon?

799
00:42:02,227 --> 00:42:05,562
She suddenly seemed to be in a bad mood as soon as Min Ah got here.

800
00:42:06,327 --> 00:42:09,697
Maybe she doesn't like it when Woo Shik and Min Ah are together.

801
00:42:09,698 --> 00:42:10,962
What are you talking about?

802
00:42:10,968 --> 00:42:13,106
Soo Yeon doesn't even like Woo Shik.

803
00:42:13,107 --> 00:42:14,331
Why wouldn't she like it?

804
00:42:15,008 --> 00:42:16,129
Do you think so?

805
00:42:24,548 --> 00:42:26,353
How long do I have to keep drinking only water?

806
00:42:28,218 --> 00:42:29,687
But if I eat anything else,

807
00:42:30,187 --> 00:42:33,012
I'm going to have to suffer greatly when I go to the bathroom.

808
00:42:35,657 --> 00:42:36,983
I'll just put some ointment on.

809
00:42:49,178 --> 00:42:50,401
I should close the curtains as well.

810
00:42:52,307 --> 00:42:53,602
I can't let anyone see.

811
00:43:06,658 --> 00:43:07,719
Why isn't this working?

812
00:43:13,627 --> 00:43:15,270
It's stuck!

813
00:43:17,138 --> 00:43:18,188
Why is it...

814
00:43:23,537 --> 00:43:24,628
Ki Bong...

815
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,447
- Ki Bong... - What's that noise?

816
00:43:26,448 --> 00:43:27,671
I think it's Jun Ki's voice.

817
00:43:27,678 --> 00:43:28,698
Let's go and see.

818
00:43:33,118 --> 00:43:34,179
Why is the door locked?

819
00:43:34,917 --> 00:43:37,713
Ki Bong... Please save...

820
00:43:37,928 --> 00:43:39,456
- Ki Bong, help me... - Jun Ki!

821
00:43:39,457 --> 00:43:40,477
What's wrong?

822
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:42,123
Lee Jun Ki! Open the door!

823
00:43:42,227 --> 00:43:43,626
Ki Bong...

824
00:43:43,627 --> 00:43:45,766
Ki Bong, just break it open!

825
00:43:45,767 --> 00:43:46,787
Okay.

826
00:43:48,537 --> 00:43:49,619
Jun Ki!

827
00:43:54,607 --> 00:43:56,004
Lee Jun Ki, what do you think you're doing?

828
00:43:56,178 --> 00:43:57,943
- Are you crazy? - What?

829
00:43:58,178 --> 00:44:00,728
You said you were fine. You said you were over it!

830
00:44:00,778 --> 00:44:01,916
What do you think you're doing?

831
00:44:01,917 --> 00:44:02,998
What are you talking about?

832
00:44:03,218 --> 00:44:05,391
- It's not what you think. - It is.

833
00:44:05,818 --> 00:44:07,186
How could you do this...

834
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:08,239
Do what?

835
00:44:10,357 --> 00:44:11,816
What are you even thinking?

836
00:44:12,057 --> 00:44:14,257
It's not what you think! I was trying to draw the curtains,

837
00:44:14,258 --> 00:44:15,991
and it got caught around my neck.

838
00:44:16,457 --> 00:44:17,820
Then why did you lock your door?

839
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,367
Why did you do that??

840
00:44:22,794 --> 00:44:23,653
I just had...

841
00:44:23,934 --> 00:44:25,766
something going on.

842
00:44:25,767 --> 00:44:27,879
What something? Tell us.

843
00:44:27,977 --> 00:44:29,161
It's just...

844
00:44:29,607 --> 00:44:30,627
I...

845
00:44:30,848 --> 00:44:32,785
Why can't you tell us? Why?

846
00:44:33,377 --> 00:44:37,427
It's really not what you're thinking!

847
00:44:40,048 --> 00:44:41,893
What? Jun Ki?

848
00:44:42,088 --> 00:44:43,157
Are you serious?

849
00:44:43,158 --> 00:44:44,350
It's true.

850
00:44:45,158 --> 00:44:46,718
I thought he was fine again.

851
00:44:47,028 --> 00:44:48,353
I don't know what happened.

852
00:44:48,798 --> 00:44:51,276
What's making him so depressed?

853
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:55,214
Ki Bong will stay with him all the time.

854
00:44:55,368 --> 00:44:56,623
Don't worry too much.

855
00:44:59,508 --> 00:45:02,576
I'd like to make some coffee for Woo Shik.

856
00:45:02,577 --> 00:45:04,907
- Where is it? - Coffee?

857
00:45:04,908 --> 00:45:06,277
I can make it for you. Just a second.

858
00:45:06,278 --> 00:45:08,257
It's okay. I can do it.

859
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:10,969
You're our guest. I can't make you make coffee.

860
00:45:11,747 --> 00:45:14,675
We have some yuzu tea too. Do you want some?

861
00:45:14,888 --> 00:45:17,163
- Yes, please. - Give me a second.

862
00:45:23,397 --> 00:45:24,652
Why won't it open?

863
00:45:26,928 --> 00:45:28,631
The lid must be stuck.

864
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:30,337
Should I try?

865
00:45:30,338 --> 00:45:32,479
Well, no. I can do it.

866
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:40,033
Min Ah, I'm sorry.

867
00:45:40,207 --> 00:45:41,371
Soo Yeon.

868
00:45:41,678 --> 00:45:44,064
It opened so suddenly.

869
00:45:44,348 --> 00:45:46,326
Are you okay? I'm so sorry.

870
00:45:47,457 --> 00:45:49,763
Don't worry. I'm okay.

871
00:45:49,888 --> 00:45:51,927
You must have been startled. Are you really okay?

872
00:45:51,928 --> 00:45:54,070
Try putting some ice on it.

873
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,249
Okay.

874
00:45:57,827 --> 00:45:58,991
I'm sorry.

875
00:46:01,167 --> 00:46:02,422
Why did I make such a mistake?

876
00:46:03,338 --> 00:46:05,816
Was it really a mistake?

877
00:46:08,207 --> 00:46:09,606
What do you mean?

878
00:46:09,607 --> 00:46:13,830
Why did the lid open just at that moment?

879
00:46:14,077 --> 00:46:15,168
What?

880
00:46:15,877 --> 00:46:18,233
Do you mean I did that on purpose?

881
00:46:19,718 --> 00:46:22,002
- Why would I do that? - I don't know.

882
00:46:22,588 --> 00:46:24,770
It really was a mistake.

883
00:46:30,827 --> 00:46:33,527
Hey. Why would you say such a thing?

884
00:46:33,528 --> 00:46:36,495
I mean, it can't be just a coincidence.

885
00:46:36,997 --> 00:46:38,568
- Don't you think so? - Cut it out.

886
00:46:39,238 --> 00:46:40,876
You're being absurd.

887
00:46:40,877 --> 00:46:43,459
I'm not sure. It's a little suspicious.

888
00:46:50,167 --> 00:46:51,738
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

889
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:55,369
I need to put on some ointment. Why isn't he leaving me?

890
00:46:57,778 --> 00:46:59,511
Why are you doing this?

891
00:46:59,647 --> 00:47:01,962
It's just a misunderstanding.

892
00:47:02,548 --> 00:47:03,947
Just tell me why,

893
00:47:03,948 --> 00:47:05,344
and I'll leave you alone.

894
00:47:06,247 --> 00:47:07,472
The thing is...

895
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:11,083
Gosh, should I just tell him?

896
00:47:11,558 --> 00:47:14,037
But then they'll tease me so much.

897
00:47:14,328 --> 00:47:17,418
Last time, they almost drove me crazy.

898
00:47:18,198 --> 00:47:21,360
Even if I get a colostomy,

899
00:47:21,567 --> 00:47:23,867
I'll never tell them.

900
00:47:23,868 --> 00:47:25,949
What is it? Tell me.

901
00:47:26,238 --> 00:47:28,349
Forget it. Think whatever you want.

902
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:30,976
Aren't you going to work today?

903
00:47:30,977 --> 00:47:32,272
How can I work in a situation like this?

904
00:47:32,877 --> 00:47:36,039
We're taking a day off because of you, so don't worry.

905
00:47:38,287 --> 00:47:39,776
This is driving me crazy.

906
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:42,909
Gosh.

907
00:47:43,258 --> 00:47:45,124
- Where are you going? - It's none of your business.

908
00:47:45,428 --> 00:47:46,509
Let me come with you.

909
00:47:50,528 --> 00:47:52,843
- What are you doing? - What do you think?

910
00:47:53,098 --> 00:47:54,396
You can go ahead.

911
00:47:54,397 --> 00:47:55,896
I can't with you standing here like this.

912
00:47:55,897 --> 00:47:58,417
We're friends. We've even taken a bath together.

913
00:47:58,508 --> 00:47:59,766
You can go ahead.

914
00:47:59,767 --> 00:48:01,746
- Is this really necessary? - Yes.

915
00:48:01,877 --> 00:48:04,804
I'll never leave you for a second.

916
00:48:05,647 --> 00:48:07,035
Darn it.

917
00:48:08,477 --> 00:48:09,946
Gosh. Move.

918
00:48:11,317 --> 00:48:13,389
Where are you going? Wait for me.

919
00:48:15,857 --> 00:48:18,286
Will Jun Ki be all right?

920
00:48:18,287 --> 00:48:21,657
Ki Bong is with him. You don't have to worry.

921
00:48:21,658 --> 00:48:23,188
That's why I'm worried.

922
00:48:23,298 --> 00:48:24,899
Ki Bong is pretty stupid.

923
00:48:26,298 --> 00:48:28,949
Hey. What's so bad about being stupid?

924
00:48:29,037 --> 00:48:30,697
He's a nice guy.

925
00:48:30,698 --> 00:48:32,442
He's loyal and responsible.

926
00:48:32,508 --> 00:48:35,803
Are you really smart enough to call him stupid?

927
00:48:35,977 --> 00:48:37,640
Well, what I mean is...

928
00:48:38,147 --> 00:48:40,248
- Why are you so upset? - What?

929
00:48:40,278 --> 00:48:43,541
I'm not. I'm not upset at all.

930
00:48:46,718 --> 00:48:48,349
Yu Ri, what's that?

931
00:48:48,758 --> 00:48:49,911
This?

932
00:48:50,017 --> 00:48:53,394
You can stretch your back and shoulders with this.

933
00:48:53,558 --> 00:48:54,853
I see.

934
00:48:55,598 --> 00:48:57,494
I've been feeling a bit stiff in the back lately.

935
00:48:57,598 --> 00:48:59,158
Can I give it a try?

936
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:00,829
Sure. Here you go.

937
00:49:06,968 --> 00:49:08,876
- This is quite nice. - Right?

938
00:49:08,877 --> 00:49:10,876
Try to stretch it even more.

939
00:49:10,877 --> 00:49:11,999
Okay.

940
00:49:13,578 --> 00:49:14,770
This feels so good.

941
00:49:15,477 --> 00:49:16,946
Do you have...

942
00:49:24,017 --> 00:49:26,914
Min Ah, how long have you been standing here? Are you okay?

943
00:49:27,758 --> 00:49:28,879
Soo Yeon.

944
00:49:30,298 --> 00:49:32,566
I lost the band by mistake.

945
00:49:32,567 --> 00:49:34,129
How could you lose it...

946
00:49:34,698 --> 00:49:37,336
- just at that moment? - It really was a mistake.

947
00:49:37,337 --> 00:49:38,459
I swear.

948
00:49:39,537 --> 00:49:40,730
I'm sorry, Min Ah.

949
00:49:41,138 --> 00:49:43,585
Don't worry. It's okay.

950
00:49:43,738 --> 00:49:44,870
My goodness.

951
00:49:45,278 --> 00:49:47,876
Follow me. Let me put some ice on it.

952
00:49:47,877 --> 00:49:49,071
It's okay.

953
00:49:49,218 --> 00:49:51,533
I feel too bad. Come with me.

954
00:49:51,848 --> 00:49:53,990
My goodness. I'm so sorry.

955
00:49:56,587 --> 00:49:58,729
Yu Ri, are you still not suspicious?

956
00:49:58,888 --> 00:50:01,887
How could she slap Min Ah not just once but twice?

957
00:50:02,997 --> 00:50:05,547
No way. I'm not sure.

958
00:50:11,567 --> 00:50:12,689
Gosh.

959
00:50:13,107 --> 00:50:15,219
They tied up my arms.

960
00:50:16,078 --> 00:50:19,035
I can't put on any ointment or take a sitz bath.

961
00:50:20,107 --> 00:50:22,393
What if I really end up getting a colostomy?

962
00:50:26,888 --> 00:50:28,550
They seem to be fast asleep.

963
00:50:29,457 --> 00:50:30,814
Should I untie my arms and go take a sitz bath?

964
00:50:46,337 --> 00:50:48,623
Why can't I untie it?

965
00:50:49,278 --> 00:50:51,184
It's tied up so tight.

966
00:50:51,877 --> 00:50:53,917
My goodness.

967
00:51:05,388 --> 00:51:07,979
I'll take a sitz bath before they wake up...

968
00:51:08,328 --> 00:51:10,948
and pretend nothing happened.

969
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:12,589
Okay.

970
00:51:14,298 --> 00:51:16,896
Oh, this is nice.

971
00:51:16,897 --> 00:51:18,468
It's perfect.

972
00:51:19,408 --> 00:51:20,631
All right. I should hurry up.

973
00:51:35,558 --> 00:51:37,527
Wait. Where is he?

974
00:51:38,058 --> 00:51:40,168
- Woo Shik, wake up. - What?

975
00:51:40,287 --> 00:51:42,573
- What's wrong? - Jun Ki disappeared.

976
00:51:42,627 --> 00:51:43,626
Really?

977
00:51:43,627 --> 00:51:44,896
That brat...

978
00:51:44,897 --> 00:51:47,212
- Let's hurry up and look for him. - Okay.

979
00:51:54,808 --> 00:51:57,225
Isn't that Jun Ki?

980
00:51:57,738 --> 00:51:58,829
I think so.

981
00:52:04,517 --> 00:52:06,180
Jun Ki, what are you doing in there?

982
00:52:06,448 --> 00:52:08,804
Gosh, why are they up?

983
00:52:10,258 --> 00:52:11,991
What are you doing in there?

984
00:52:12,457 --> 00:52:14,856
What else would I do in the bathroom?

985
00:52:14,857 --> 00:52:16,428
Then why were you moaning?

986
00:52:16,727 --> 00:52:18,094
What's going on?

987
00:52:18,328 --> 00:52:19,527
Open the door right now,

988
00:52:19,528 --> 00:52:20,895
or we'll break it down.

989
00:52:21,798 --> 00:52:24,706
No, it's not what you think it is.

990
00:52:24,707 --> 00:52:25,962
As if.

991
00:52:26,067 --> 00:52:29,077
Ki Bong, let's just break it down.

992
00:52:29,078 --> 00:52:30,936
Guys, stop! No!

993
00:52:30,937 --> 00:52:33,252
No! Stop!

994
00:52:34,377 --> 00:52:35,577
What are you doing?

995
00:52:35,578 --> 00:52:37,251
Why didn't you open the door?

996
00:52:37,517 --> 00:52:40,067
Why are you standing up?

997
00:52:41,417 --> 00:52:42,988
I'm done.

998
00:52:43,218 --> 00:52:44,789
- I was just going out. - Hold on.

999
00:52:45,187 --> 00:52:47,737
What's that? Why did you fill that basin with water?

1000
00:52:49,897 --> 00:52:53,232
- I just wanted to wash my face. - I see.

1001
00:52:53,428 --> 00:52:55,166
Why didn't you just use the sink?

1002
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:58,534
Just because. My mom used a basin when I was little.

1003
00:52:58,607 --> 00:53:00,913
Really? Then go on.

1004
00:53:02,477 --> 00:53:03,864
While we watch from here.

1005
00:53:07,207 --> 00:53:08,910
All right.

1006
00:53:10,417 --> 00:53:13,344
Hey, why are you throwing away that water?

1007
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:17,205
Well, it's become cold.

1008
00:53:17,787 --> 00:53:19,456
I'll fill it with some warm water.

1009
00:53:19,457 --> 00:53:21,294
It's a waste.

1010
00:53:21,428 --> 00:53:22,581
Let me use it.

1011
00:53:22,798 --> 00:53:25,786
You woke me up. I'll just wash my face now.

1012
00:53:25,928 --> 00:53:27,018
No!

1013
00:53:27,598 --> 00:53:29,230
Do you really want to wash your face with this water?

1014
00:53:29,638 --> 00:53:31,198
- It's not warm anymore. - It's okay.

1015
00:53:31,337 --> 00:53:32,561
I like lukewarm water better.

1016
00:53:33,468 --> 00:53:35,783
Well, then let me wash my face.

1017
00:53:36,808 --> 00:53:38,706
Hey. Just don't.

1018
00:53:38,707 --> 00:53:40,309
Don't wash your face with this water.

1019
00:53:40,448 --> 00:53:41,805
It's really okay.

1020
00:53:42,317 --> 00:53:45,103
Hey! No! Stop!

1021
00:53:45,218 --> 00:53:47,086
You can't wash your face with this water.

1022
00:53:47,087 --> 00:53:48,856
What's wrong with you? It's just water.

1023
00:53:48,857 --> 00:53:50,586
- What are you doing? - Let me go.

1024
00:53:50,587 --> 00:53:52,157
- No, please don't. - This feels good.

1025
00:53:52,158 --> 00:53:53,515
No, please...

1026
00:53:54,357 --> 00:53:55,449
This feels nice.

1027
00:53:57,038 --> 00:53:58,434
What? Hemorrhoids?

1028
00:53:58,978 --> 00:54:01,079
So it wasn't what we had in mind?

1029
00:54:01,337 --> 00:54:02,806
You were trying to apply ointment...

1030
00:54:03,378 --> 00:54:05,418
so you locked the door and closed the curtains?

1031
00:54:05,447 --> 00:54:07,079
And the curtain suddenly got wrapped around your neck?

1032
00:54:08,087 --> 00:54:09,107
Yes.

1033
00:54:09,518 --> 00:54:11,557
Well, your butt wouldn't have lasted...

1034
00:54:11,558 --> 00:54:13,057
since you farted all the time.

1035
00:54:13,058 --> 00:54:14,078
Hang on.

1036
00:54:14,288 --> 00:54:15,889
Then that water in the basin...

1037
00:54:16,288 --> 00:54:18,194
Did you use that water for a sitz bath?

1038
00:54:18,498 --> 00:54:20,089
- Yes. - What are you talking about?

1039
00:54:20,358 --> 00:54:21,448
What is a sitz bath?

1040
00:54:22,297 --> 00:54:23,349
Well, it's...

1041
00:54:28,438 --> 00:54:29,458
What?

1042
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:32,766
Are you telling me Jun Ki dipped his butt in that water?

1043
00:54:33,237 --> 00:54:35,552
You should've told me earlier, you idiot!

1044
00:54:36,547 --> 00:54:38,658
This is so nasty. Darn it.

1045
00:54:38,717 --> 00:54:39,769
Sorry.

1046
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:43,075
I couldn't tell you since I was afraid you guys might tease me.

1047
00:54:43,288 --> 00:54:46,786
And you better not tell this to the girls.

1048
00:54:46,987 --> 00:54:48,824
- Okay? - Whatever, you idiot!

1049
00:54:49,558 --> 00:54:51,088
I better go wash my hands.

1050
00:54:51,527 --> 00:54:52,579
I'm sorry.

1051
00:54:55,527 --> 00:54:56,955
- Woo Shik. - What?

1052
00:54:57,067 --> 00:54:58,296
I have a favor to ask you.

1053
00:54:58,297 --> 00:54:59,592
Okay, what is it?

1054
00:54:59,867 --> 00:55:01,469
Can you apply this on me?

1055
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:03,588
Here.

1056
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:05,872
It's so tough doing it alone.

1057
00:55:08,277 --> 00:55:10,655
Why aren't you sticking next to Jun Ki today?

1058
00:55:10,748 --> 00:55:12,481
What? Well...

1059
00:55:13,648 --> 00:55:15,248
We were mistaken.

1060
00:55:15,387 --> 00:55:17,316
Jun Ki is okay now. Don't worry about him.

1061
00:55:17,317 --> 00:55:19,357
Really? I'm so relieved.

1062
00:55:19,688 --> 00:55:21,667
What was the matter with him?

1063
00:55:21,987 --> 00:55:23,007
What?

1064
00:55:23,858 --> 00:55:25,285
It's nothing, so don't worry.

1065
00:55:26,858 --> 00:55:29,796
Ki Bong, since we're finished, shall we go open for business?

1066
00:55:29,797 --> 00:55:31,636
Okay. You can go wait first.

1067
00:55:31,637 --> 00:55:32,736
I'll take our luggage.

1068
00:55:32,737 --> 00:55:34,366
No, I'll help you.

1069
00:55:34,367 --> 00:55:36,479
It's too heavy for you.

1070
00:55:37,637 --> 00:55:39,336
It's fine, I'm strong too.

1071
00:55:39,337 --> 00:55:40,676
I'm stronger than you.

1072
00:55:40,677 --> 00:55:41,799
No, you're not.

1073
00:55:42,978 --> 00:55:44,406
What are you two doing?

1074
00:55:44,808 --> 00:55:47,676
You guys look like you're in love or something.

1075
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:48,769
I know.

1076
00:55:49,047 --> 00:55:51,231
You two seem fishy since yesterday.

1077
00:55:51,317 --> 00:55:53,194
Hey, you're mistaken.

1078
00:55:54,058 --> 00:55:57,189
Ki Bong, get the sauce container and come outside. Okay?

1079
00:55:57,558 --> 00:55:59,088
Oh, okay.

1080
00:56:00,297 --> 00:56:01,317
I'm so full.

1081
00:56:03,467 --> 00:56:04,794
I'll see you later then.

1082
00:56:08,038 --> 00:56:09,741
I'll work really hard today.

1083
00:56:09,768 --> 00:56:10,858
See you.

1084
00:56:11,938 --> 00:56:15,506
There's definitely something different about those two.

1085
00:56:15,507 --> 00:56:16,976
Yes, I feel it too.

1086
00:56:19,018 --> 00:56:21,119
By the way, where is Woo Shik?

1087
00:56:21,688 --> 00:56:22,917
Min Ah came by this morning,

1088
00:56:22,918 --> 00:56:24,753
and they're in a lesson in the third floor.

1089
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:28,378
I see.

1090
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:30,508
Why?

1091
00:56:30,657 --> 00:56:31,923
Does it bother you?

1092
00:56:32,858 --> 00:56:34,765
I told you it doesn't. What's wrong with you?

1093
00:56:35,668 --> 00:56:37,259
I was just asking.

1094
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:40,037
I better go see Jun Ki.

1095
00:56:45,438 --> 00:56:47,111
Why does she keep asking me that?

1096
00:56:49,177 --> 00:56:51,187
Soo Yeon is crankier than I thought.

1097
00:56:51,947 --> 00:56:53,957
I wonder if Jun Ki is really okay.

1098
00:57:02,157 --> 00:57:03,279
Oh, gosh.

1099
00:57:04,688 --> 00:57:06,756
What are you doing? You startled me.

1100
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:07,818
Sorry.

1101
00:57:09,498 --> 00:57:12,700
Are those tears in your eyes?

1102
00:57:12,837 --> 00:57:13,857
What?

1103
00:57:14,137 --> 00:57:16,866
No, it's because I yawned.

1104
00:57:16,867 --> 00:57:17,989
Really?

1105
00:57:18,337 --> 00:57:20,173
Shouldn't you get something to eat?

1106
00:57:20,407 --> 00:57:21,907
Do you want me to get you some porridge?

1107
00:57:22,447 --> 00:57:23,467
No, thanks.

1108
00:57:24,148 --> 00:57:25,403
I don't have an appetite right now.

1109
00:57:29,688 --> 00:57:32,473
What? He doesn't seem okay at all.

1110
00:57:36,257 --> 00:57:37,656
Hello, everyone.

1111
00:57:37,657 --> 00:57:39,289
I'm Han Soo Yeon of Report Special Force.

1112
00:57:39,427 --> 00:57:40,796
I'm at Yanggu, Gangwon Province...

1113
00:57:40,797 --> 00:57:43,480
to see a cow that can write letters using its tail.

1114
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:45,336
Shall we go meet the cow that's known as...

1115
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:47,173
the Han Seok Bong of livestock?

1116
00:57:47,637 --> 00:57:48,831
Shall we go...

1117
00:57:50,768 --> 00:57:52,063
What's that smell?

1118
00:57:54,438 --> 00:57:56,896
Right. I left a stew cooking inside the stove.

1119
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:02,415
Oh, no!

1120
00:58:06,587 --> 00:58:08,669
That's hot. It's all burnt.

1121
00:58:09,587 --> 00:58:10,710
There's too much smoke.

1122
00:58:12,228 --> 00:58:13,318
Oh, gosh.

1123
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:14,923
Darn it, this is bad.

1124
00:58:21,038 --> 00:58:22,803
Min Ah, why did you suddenly pop out?

1125
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:25,672
What is all this smoke?

1126
00:58:25,777 --> 00:58:26,858
I know.

1127
00:58:27,608 --> 00:58:28,628
Min Ah.

1128
00:58:29,248 --> 00:58:30,607
- Yes? - What's wrong?

1129
00:58:30,608 --> 00:58:31,628
Well...

1130
00:58:31,947 --> 00:58:33,886
Soo Yeon slapped me again.

1131
00:58:33,947 --> 00:58:34,967
What?

1132
00:58:35,148 --> 00:58:37,085
Soo Yeon slapped you again?

1133
00:58:38,217 --> 00:58:39,614
Soo Yeon, what is she talking about?

1134
00:58:39,918 --> 00:58:41,081
No, the thing is...

1135
00:58:41,558 --> 00:58:44,209
I was waving my hands in order to get rid of the smoke...

1136
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:46,656
and Min Ah suddenly popped out of nowhere.

1137
00:58:46,657 --> 00:58:49,992
So you just happened to slap her again by mistake?

1138
00:58:50,998 --> 00:58:52,018
Yes.

1139
00:58:53,538 --> 00:58:56,363
I'm sorry, Min Ah. It was really an accident.

1140
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,567
It's true, Jung Eun.

1141
00:59:02,308 --> 00:59:04,287
I'm really telling the truth, Woo Shik.

1142
00:59:08,217 --> 00:59:09,574
It was really an accident.

1143
00:59:11,918 --> 00:59:13,008
My butt...

1144
00:59:13,188 --> 00:59:14,310
Gosh.

1145
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:19,130
The performance is just around the corner.

1146
00:59:19,898 --> 00:59:21,255
I should keep practicing my dancing.

1147
00:59:23,128 --> 00:59:24,862
I'll endure the pain...

1148
00:59:25,137 --> 00:59:26,392
and try practicing.

1149
00:59:30,038 --> 00:59:32,577
Nakyang, Dongcheon, Leehwajung

1150
00:59:32,578 --> 00:59:34,516
What's wrong? What is this?

1151
00:59:34,837 --> 00:59:37,255
Darn it. How did this thing get stuck?

1152
00:59:48,527 --> 00:59:50,262
How did it get tangled up?

1153
00:59:51,257 --> 00:59:53,756
Why didn't anyone remove that nail?

1154
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:55,328
Jun Ki, I brought some porridge...

1155
01:00:01,467 --> 01:00:02,528
(Porridge)

1156
01:00:03,407 --> 01:00:05,172
Jun Ki, no!

1157
01:00:17,887 --> 01:00:19,244
Gosh, my butt.

1158
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:21,614
Jun Ki, I'm sorry.

1159
01:00:22,228 --> 01:00:24,706
- Does it hurt a lot? - Of course it does!

1160
01:00:24,958 --> 01:00:26,732
My butt was caught in the edge of that chair.

1161
01:00:27,427 --> 01:00:28,722
This is all your fault.

1162
01:00:29,697 --> 01:00:32,390
- My butt. - I was just worried about you.

1163
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:35,506
I really thought you were trying to kill yourself.

1164
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:36,966
Why would I kill myself?

1165
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,736
Wait, what's wrong with you?

1166
01:00:38,737 --> 01:00:39,829
Are you crying?

1167
01:00:40,177 --> 01:00:41,402
Don't cry.

1168
01:00:41,677 --> 01:00:43,176
You look even uglier when you cry.

1169
01:00:43,177 --> 01:00:44,299
Shut it.

1170
01:00:46,078 --> 01:00:47,098
Hey.

1171
01:00:47,617 --> 01:00:49,116
Were you that worried about me?

1172
01:00:49,748 --> 01:00:50,870
Yes, you jerk.

1173
01:00:53,418 --> 01:00:55,672
I'm glad there's someone who's worried about me.

1174
01:00:57,027 --> 01:00:58,079
Jung Eun.

1175
01:00:58,797 --> 01:00:59,849
If...

1176
01:01:00,398 --> 01:01:03,426
I have to get a colostomy,

1177
01:01:03,828 --> 01:01:07,397
you really have to take care of me for the rest of my life.

1178
01:01:07,398 --> 01:01:08,632
- Okay? - What?

1179
01:01:09,237 --> 01:01:10,329
Are you crazy?

1180
01:01:10,808 --> 01:01:12,338
I'm sorry.

1181
01:01:12,808 --> 01:01:13,828
Are you okay?

1182
01:01:19,078 --> 01:01:21,118
I really didn't hit her on purpose.

1183
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:23,313
This is so frustrating.

1184
01:01:23,648 --> 01:01:25,932
Why would I hit Min Ah on purpose?

1185
01:01:27,858 --> 01:01:30,580
Does it mean I'm jealous because I like Woo Shik?

1186
01:01:32,657 --> 01:01:33,677
That's ridiculous.

1187
01:01:35,697 --> 01:01:38,554
You have to hold in your emotions as much as possible...

1188
01:01:38,797 --> 01:01:40,236
and let it out in this part.

1189
01:01:40,237 --> 01:01:42,482
That will make it sound much better. Okay?

1190
01:01:42,637 --> 01:01:44,307
I know that too,

1191
01:01:44,308 --> 01:01:45,939
but it's not as easy as it seems.

1192
01:01:46,907 --> 01:01:48,264
By the way, Mr. Cha.

1193
01:01:48,378 --> 01:01:50,546
- What? - When you work,

1194
01:01:50,547 --> 01:01:52,116
do you know you look so handsome?

1195
01:01:52,117 --> 01:01:54,393
What? What are you talking about suddenly?

1196
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:56,523
I'm always handsome.

1197
01:01:56,688 --> 01:01:58,986
You're still a snob, aren't you?

1198
01:01:58,987 --> 01:02:01,405
What? You little... I was just kidding.

1199
01:02:21,578 --> 01:02:22,946
Soo Yeon, what are you doing?

1200
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:25,151
Can't you see? I'm cleaning.

1201
01:02:25,648 --> 01:02:27,310
I already cleaned here though.

1202
01:02:27,617 --> 01:02:30,269
What are you talking about? Do you see all this dust?

1203
01:02:30,547 --> 01:02:32,250
Woo Shik, lift your legs.

1204
01:02:32,587 --> 01:02:33,638
Okay.

1205
01:02:37,858 --> 01:02:39,490
Min Ah, can you lift your legs too?

1206
01:02:42,828 --> 01:02:45,622
Is this a house or a pigpen?

1207
01:02:45,998 --> 01:02:48,384
I can't believe it!
