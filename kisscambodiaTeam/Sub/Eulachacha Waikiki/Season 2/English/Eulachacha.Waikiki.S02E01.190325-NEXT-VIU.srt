1
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:58,126
Cut! Okay.

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,784
That was some killer action. Great job.

3
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:11,039
Ta-da!

4
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,278
The stunt scene is over, so bring the lead actress.

5
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:14,330
Okay.

6
00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:17,555
Thank you. Have a good day.

7
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,000
Have...

8
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,795
Is it so hard for them to say I did a good job or what?

9
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:28,905
How did I end up being so pitiful?

10
00:02:30,429 --> 00:02:32,099
- This tastes so bitter. - Jun Ki, here's your phone.

11
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,599
- What? - It's been ringing off the hook.

12
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,691
Thank you.

13
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,292
Hello?

14
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:40,390
What?

15
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:42,744
Darn it!

16
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,898
This song is for all those ladies out there.

17
00:03:13,899 --> 00:03:15,063
It's "Ddaeng Beol".

18
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,349
You are such an untrustworthy person

19
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,400
Sing together.

20
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:29,049
You are such an immature person

21
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,212
Let's clap together.

22
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:36,172
No matter how much I try to comfort you, it's useless

23
00:03:36,529 --> 00:03:41,426
You are a really good man deep down inside

24
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:44,506
Chrysanthemum for today

25
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,445
What? I'm in class now.

26
00:03:48,809 --> 00:03:52,043
You try to flirt with me

27
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:55,087
What? Darn it.

28
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,789
He has one pitch left to win the championship.

29
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,558
Kook Ki Bong is having a no-hitter game until the ninth inning.

30
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:11,599
Everything depends on this last pitch.

31
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,486
The count is 3 balls and 2 strikes right now.

32
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:16,768
Kook needs to be careful with throwing a breaking ball.

33
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,198
Sato is probably expecting a breaking ball right now.

34
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,409
Okay. It's a very tense moment.

35
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,521
It's a full count for Kook right now.

36
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:29,270
Ready.

37
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:41,018
- Strike! He strikes out the batter! - Yes!

38
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:43,388
He did it! They win the championship!

39
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:44,698
Thank you, Sato!

40
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,029
The national hero Kook Ki Bong has led his team...

41
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,498
to victory by throwing a no-hitter and no-run game.

42
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:51,029
He is truly an amazing player.

43
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:58,641
Get your butt up!

44
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:00,672
Hey, Kook Ki Bong!

45
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:05,302
A no-hitter! Champions!

46
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:07,479
You fainted while you were running.

47
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,255
Did you even have a dream?

48
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,371
Get up already!

49
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,058
Don't you want to go to the major league?

50
00:05:12,059 --> 00:05:13,692
Are you going to rot forever in the minor league?

51
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:17,589
Coach, can I get this call?

52
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,191
You idiot, get it.

53
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,057
Goodness.

54
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,590
Hello?

55
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,841
What? I'm training right now.

56
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,961
What? Darn it!

57
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,856
Good. Now that's how you run.

58
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:40,589
What is he doing? Where are you going?

59
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,110
What do you think?

60
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:49,959
It's neat inside, and the interior is nice too.

61
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,029
- Do you like it? - Yes.

62
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,498
On top of that, this is such a great location,

63
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:54,529
so it'll be good for business.

64
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,774
You can just use everything in here.

65
00:05:56,999 --> 00:05:58,399
- Isn't it great? - Yes.

66
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,796
I hope you make the right choice.

67
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,343
This is driving me crazy.

68
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,241
Why aren't they coming?

69
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,061
Everyone who lived here became successful with their work.

70
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,709
From movie directors, journalists,

71
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,649
and a CEO of a shopping mall to a patissier.

72
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,618
All of them made a fortune.

73
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,525
- Ma'am! - Ma'am!

74
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,140
Who are you?

75
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:24,426
- Who are they? - They're the only strange ones.

76
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,551
I really mean it.

77
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:30,390
I'll think about it a bit more and call you back.

78
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:32,039
- Goodbye. - But...

79
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,998
- You should have a closer look. - Excuse me.

80
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:35,938
I have more places to show you!

81
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:37,398
Sir, I'm asking you...

82
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:42,178
Good grief. What do you think you're doing?

83
00:06:42,179 --> 00:06:46,419
How could you put this place out for sale without discussing with us?

84
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,746
Then you should pay the rent.

85
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,919
Do you know how many months you're overdue?

86
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,888
If you give us one week, we'll take care of the rent...

87
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:55,229
Do you know how many months you've been saying that?

88
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,821
It's been about 4 months and 2 weeks...

89
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:04,788
Fine. I'll give you one more week and this will be your last chance.

90
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:06,398
You better pay back all the overdue rent.

91
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,409
Look how pathetic you all look.

92
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,857
What are you guys? A traffic light?

93
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,078
- Have a good day. - Hope you live long.

94
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,099
Bye.

95
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:24,188
What is this tire doing at a guesthouse?

96
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:25,445
Look who's talking.

97
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:28,928
Hey, red light. Stop.

98
00:07:28,929 --> 00:07:30,459
- Don't touch me. - Wait.

99
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,099
What took you so long to get here? I called you ages ago.

100
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,029
I came as soon as you called.

101
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,009
I still have my wig on. Don't you see this?

102
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:39,160
Darn.

103
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,198
Who put this here?

104
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,839
This is driving me crazy.

105
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,508
How can I find so much money in such a short time?

106
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:46,600
You're right.

107
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,685
Jung Eun, do you have some money?

108
00:07:49,809 --> 00:07:53,288
- Would I live off you if I did? - I knew you wouldn't have.

109
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:56,948
What's up with your look today?

110
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:58,317
Exactly.

111
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,857
How did I end up like this?

112
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:04,434
Look at me, I'm a talented actor.

113
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,928
How does it make sense for me to be just a replacement?

114
00:08:07,929 --> 00:08:09,296
Just a replacement?

115
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:11,716
- You never learn, do you? - Be quiet.

116
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,467
That's why girls dump you.

117
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:19,132
Hey! I told you...

118
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:21,008
to never talk about Seo Jin.

119
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,049
And she didn't dump me.

120
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:27,349
It was a mutual breakup.

121
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:30,149
Fine, whatever you say. I'm going to take a shower.

122
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,384
A shower?

123
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,729
Did you have to talk about the breakup?

124
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,459
Where do you think you're going?

125
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,559
Are you sticking your tongue out at me?

126
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,929
Don't you dare take a shower! It'll cost us money.

127
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,184
Stop it!

128
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:44,635
Anyway, it's all your fault. Take responsibility for it.

129
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,109
Why? Why is it all my fault?

130
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,209
You're the CEO.

131
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,791
We're just investors.

132
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:54,508
You told us that it'd be a good investment.

133
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:57,079
You said that we'd rake money once the house was renovated.

134
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,949
We're going through a global economic recession now.

135
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,748
- All guest houses are struggling. - Quiet!

136
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,018
I should've known better than to trust someone like you.

137
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,489
You only call me the CEO when something bad happens.

138
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,977
Hey. Look at that.

139
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,350
It looks as if there's a festival going on here.

140
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:15,489
- So what? - To watch meteors fall...

141
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,177
Just saying. There's a lot of people there right now.

142
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,060
Who's Meteor Shower?

143
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:23,893
Who is he and why are people gathering around to see him?

144
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,109
A singer? An actor?

145
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,577
- Are you kidding me? - I know! A soccer player!

146
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,043
I should blame myself...

147
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:39,019
for believing dummies like you and investing money.

148
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,913
It's all my fault.

149
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,059
I'm the crazy one here.

150
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,243
So who is Meteor Shower?

151
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:51,507
I feel like something good is going to happen.

152
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,098
I don't think we should be watching meteors right now.

153
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:59,378
It's going to be a historical shower,

154
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:01,072
we can't miss it.

155
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:04,508
Who knows? If we wish upon the meteors,

156
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:06,518
money might rain down our heads.

157
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,949
As if.

158
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,235
- Why are you so negative? - How would I be so positive...

159
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:13,859
when we might become homeless after a week?

160
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,135
That's why you need to be more positive.

161
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,026
Listen to me, Woo Shik.

162
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,155
Ki Bong, you too.

163
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,607
Look at each other.

164
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:27,368
Things can't be worse than this.

165
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:29,709
- Your point? - That's my point exactly.

166
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,038
We've reached the lowest point in our lives.

167
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,131
What does that mean?

168
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,781
There's nowhere to go but up.

169
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:40,568
There is no way that anything worse could happen to us.

170
00:10:40,749 --> 00:10:44,089
How can you not be positive?

171
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,180
Don't you think so?

172
00:10:46,619 --> 00:10:49,342
- Are you serious right now? - Yes.

173
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:50,912
Just die.

174
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,158
Don't even waste the oxygen you breathe, just die.

175
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:55,168
- Die! - Stop it, you two!

176
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:56,322
Seriously.

177
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,000
Look! It's starting! Look over there!

178
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,308
That's what meteors are.

179
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,383
- That's so cool. - You're right.

180
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,873
Look.

181
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:14,242
Look at that.

182
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,377
That one is huge, right?

183
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,958
It really is. Doesn't it look like it's coming right at us?

184
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:22,458
- Right? - Yes.

185
00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:24,221
- Don't you think so? - I don't care.

186
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:28,769
Isn't it coming too close to us?

187
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:31,696
- So romantic. - What if it falls right at us?

188
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:35,586
(One hundred million stars falling from the sky)

189
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,870
I'm here.

190
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:59,293
Did a star really fall here?

191
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,545
- At our guest house? - I think so.

192
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,660
So that's what a meteor looks like.

193
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,550
I guess so.

194
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:12,182
This is so cool.

195
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:15,295
Isn't this so fascinating?

196
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:18,358
You told me that things can't get worse.

197
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,934
You said we have nowhere to go but up.

198
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,408
You told us that we've reached our rock bottom.

199
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,579
We hit our rock bottom,

200
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,618
but I didn't think we could go under the rock bottom.

201
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:26,639
Quiet!

202
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,553
Look at that. We have a hole in our ceiling.

203
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:33,568
If the landlady finds out, not only will we get kicked out,

204
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,829
but we're going to get sued. Understood?

205
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:39,125
This isn't our fault.

206
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,674
- It was the gravity's fault. - You think she'll believe that?

207
00:13:41,869 --> 00:13:44,028
Remember when the windows broke because of the hail?

208
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:45,939
She made us pay for all the damage.

209
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,739
That was hail and this is a meteor.

210
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,538
How could a meteor fall down into a guesthouse?

211
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:51,968
What do we do?

212
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,250
I can't believe a meteor fell down to our guesthouse.

213
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,535
Why is this happening to us?

214
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:03,501
Hold on, Woo Shik.

215
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:05,216
- Are you okay? - Are you okay?

216
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:06,589
What should we do?

217
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,888
- Hey, Woo Shik. - Quick!

218
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,562
What do we do, Jun Ki?

219
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,532
What a genius!

220
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,908
You really have the audacity to be eating?

221
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,134
- Yes, it's tasty. - Tasty?

222
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:32,119
What are we going to do when we get busted by the landlady?

223
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:34,359
You're so whiny.

224
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,937
Just trust me. I'll take care of this.

225
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:40,549
- What are you going to do? - Just sit and watch.

226
00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:42,261
This is why we have our brains.

227
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,488
Let's see.

228
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,196
It looks messier than last night.

229
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,828
Doesn't it look completely fine now?

230
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,530
You can watch TV so close from here.

231
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,513
Ta-da!

232
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,959
- What are you doing? - We need every dollar possible.

233
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,682
We should at least try to sell whatever we have.

234
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:23,774
Let's see. Where is it?

235
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,038
- Here it is. - What is that?

236
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,913
You know Randy Johnson, right? The left-handed pitcher from MLB.

237
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:34,926
This is signed by him.

238
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:36,912
- This will cost a lot. - Are you sure?

239
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:41,079
(Hope you live a happy life! By Randy Johnson)

240
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,466
Randy Johnson wrote this?

241
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,389
Randy Johnson wrote in Korean, with perfect grammar and writing?

242
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,672
He knows how to say, "Hope you live a happy life!" in Korean?

243
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:52,349
- Maybe he learned Korean. - That's ridiculous.

244
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:55,454
- It's all fake. - No, it's not.

245
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,730
I paid 1,000 dollars to my senior to have Randy Johnson sign for me.

246
00:15:58,869 --> 00:16:00,125
Then what about...

247
00:16:01,369 --> 00:16:02,839
this bat?

248
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:06,056
(Hope you become happy-desu! From Ichiro)

249
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,320
Fine, let's assume that Ichiro learned Korean, too.

250
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,774
But even then, would he ever write "desu" in Korean?

251
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:14,457
What's that reaction? Ki Bong!

252
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,033
- Use your brain. - Be quiet.

253
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:19,888
I can't eat because you're being too loud.

254
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:23,154
Is Ki Bong's ignorance a sin?

255
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:26,158
Come here. It's okay, you're a healthy boy.

256
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:28,128
You're tall and still growing.

257
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:30,619
You drive me crazy.

258
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:34,956
Where did you get this mic with Cho Yong Pil's autography?

259
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,405
I think it's Woo Shik's.

260
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,275
What are you doing? Get up.

261
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:41,878
- For what? - To cover that hole.

262
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:43,032
Come upstairs.

263
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:51,736
The hole is bigger than what I expected.

264
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,633
Let's cover it with the sofa. You two carry it here.

265
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,985
- Okay? - Okay.

266
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,715
I'm stuck here.

267
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,568
Why did you have to push so hard?

268
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,171
You told me to push it.

269
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,592
What's wrong with you?

270
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,578
You're nothing but a useless and stupid jerk.

271
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:15,008
What?

272
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,800
I'm stuck here.

273
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,028
What are you doing? Help me out.

274
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,618
You're so annoying.

275
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,225
- Mr. Cha, are you home? - It's the landlady.

276
00:17:29,329 --> 00:17:30,558
Why is she here so early?

277
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,098
We can't let her know what happened.

278
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:33,459
- Hurry up and pull me out. - Mr. Cha!

279
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,098
I'll go downstairs and deal with her.

280
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:36,328
Ki Bong, you pull him out.

281
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:37,349
Okay.

282
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,694
All right, Jun Ki.

283
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,338
Ma'am, what are you doing here?

284
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:50,108
I think I dropped my earring around here yesterday.

285
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:51,302
Have you seen it?

286
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:53,353
Your earring? No, I haven't.

287
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,001
You haven't?

288
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,419
Hey, try harder.

289
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,612
I'm trying my best.

290
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:04,493
Why won't it come out?

291
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,091
What's that sound?

292
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,201
Did you hear that sound?

293
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,613
What sound? I didn't hear anything.

294
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:18,269
Am I hearing things?

295
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:21,021
Where could it be?

296
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,860
You must be busy. We'll find it...

297
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,048
and bring it to you.

298
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:26,917
Forget it. I can look for it myself.

299
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,820
1, 2, 3.

300
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,858
You heard that, didn't you?

301
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:40,155
What do you mean? No.

302
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,899
I didn't hear anything at all.

303
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,756
I'm sure. I heard something.

304
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,315
I think it came from the ceiling.

305
00:18:54,339 --> 00:18:57,512
- What are you doing right now? - Well, the thing is...

306
00:18:58,349 --> 00:18:59,401
I love you.

307
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,700
What?

308
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,950
I've had feelings for you for a long time.

309
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:09,028
What is this all about?

310
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:10,662
We can't talk here.

311
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:13,429
Follow me. Let's go out.

312
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,858
Oh, my.

313
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:16,768
- Come with me. - Let go.

314
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:19,146
What are you doing? Let go of me.

315
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:21,997
It hurts.

316
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:23,559
I'm sorry.

317
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,230
By the way,

318
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,437
is it true?

319
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:31,179
Do you really love me?

320
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,362
- Sorry? - Since when?

321
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:35,273
Well...

322
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:38,248
It's been about six months.

323
00:19:38,249 --> 00:19:39,310
Six months?

324
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:44,336
Is that why you've been putting up with my nagging?

325
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,658
- Yes. - Oh, my.

326
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,830
Now I understand.

327
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:53,884
I had no idea.

328
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,611
Still, this is not okay.

329
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,485
I'm too old for you.

330
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,224
In addition, I have children.

331
00:20:02,249 --> 00:20:04,548
A young man like you have nothing to do with me.

332
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:06,488
I guess. I know...

333
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,419
it's absurd.

334
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,071
Of course. It's just ridiculous.

335
00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:12,689
It won't work.

336
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,659
I guess I was way too greedy.

337
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:16,580
I'm sorry.

338
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,150
Excuse me now.

339
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,368
Be greedy.

340
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,038
Sorry?

341
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,334
Emotions are impossible to control.

342
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:33,431
So...

343
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,153
be greedy.

344
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,296
I like men who are greedy.

345
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:50,549
What?

346
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,328
You're going out with our landlady?

347
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:57,389
Yes. She and I are...

348
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,267
together as of today.

349
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:01,768
We're going on a date later.

350
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:03,808
Why did you tell that kind of lie?

351
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:05,838
Guys, what should I do now?

352
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,023
Hold on. It might be a good thing.

353
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,354
She won't nag us about the rent for a while.

354
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,518
I don't believe she'll ask her boyfriend for rent.

355
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:14,080
- You want me to keep dating her? - Yes.

356
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,088
That would be deceiving her.

357
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:17,189
It doesn't have to be.

358
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,288
You can date her for real.

359
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:21,259
She's not that bad.

360
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,489
She owns a lot of buildings, money,

361
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,213
and wrinkles. And she's old.

362
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,824
What about you?

363
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:31,399
She's completely out of your league.

364
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,001
Are you serious?

365
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:37,239
What can we do? Tell her the truth and end up on the street?

366
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,840
This is driving me crazy.

367
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,778
Why is nothing going our way?

368
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:42,879
This might be our chance.

369
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,032
I'm home.

370
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,248
Hey. From your shifts?

371
00:21:46,249 --> 00:21:49,759
Yes, at three different places. I'm exhausted.

372
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,318
What's with him?

373
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:54,543
Nothing.

374
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,914
What's this box?

375
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,558
A yearbook?

376
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:01,828
It's our high school yearbook.

377
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:03,941
Really? Let me take a look.

378
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:05,153
You don't want to.

379
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,871
You guys all look so young.

380
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,602
Who's this girl?

381
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:17,248
Why is she surrounded by boys?

382
00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:18,330
Which one?

383
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:20,874
That's Soo Yeon.

384
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:22,478
Her name is Han Soo Yeon.

385
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,671
She's our first love.

386
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,219
- "First love"? - Yes.

387
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,382
But what do you mean, "our first love"?

388
00:22:27,589 --> 00:22:30,229
She is the first love of all three of you?

389
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,515
That's right.

390
00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:32,784
Not just us,

391
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:35,144
but all the boys in the school.

392
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:36,319
Really?

393
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:38,568
She's not even that pretty.

394
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:39,739
Kim Jung Eun!

395
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,669
Gosh. Why did you have to yell?

396
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,679
- Hey. - You're out of line.

397
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:45,909
Soo Yeon is not that pretty?

398
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,102
Soo Yeon was...

399
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:50,302
our dream.

400
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:54,019
(Huam High School)

401
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:28,578
- Left, right, left, right. - Left, right, left, right.

402
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:29,874
Guys.

403
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,288
Big news.

404
00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:34,459
What's the fuss about?

405
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,735
We have a new student in our class.

406
00:23:36,859 --> 00:23:38,217
It's a girl.

407
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,076
Also, she's supposed to be super pretty.

408
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:42,669
Is that it?

409
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,076
We're not interested.

410
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,439
There she is.

411
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,296
Gosh, we're not interested at all.

412
00:23:59,349 --> 00:24:01,828
All three of us fell in love with Soo Yeon at first sight.

413
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:05,275
From her face to body...

414
00:24:05,589 --> 00:24:07,292
and feisty personality,

415
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,464
she was just perfect.

416
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,989
Even her family was rich.

417
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,304
She was elegant from head to toe.

418
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,842
So? What happened?

419
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,139
Did any of you ask her out?

420
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,201
Of course.

421
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,231
Knock-knock.

422
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,170
Drink it.

423
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:37,395
Okay. Thank you.

424
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,665
The moment you drink it, we become a couple.

425
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:51,993
Too bad.

426
00:24:53,499 --> 00:24:55,958
I saw you swallow a sip of it.

427
00:24:57,009 --> 00:24:59,120
Are we together now?

428
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,485
That day, Soo Yeon even threw up her gastric juice and bile.

429
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,423
Every drop of it.

430
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,919
What about you, Ki Bong?

431
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,940
Soo Yeon!

432
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,122
The moment this ball...

433
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:21,953
hits that can,

434
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:28,661
we're together.

435
00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:37,100
Darn.

436
00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:54,309
That was the first time Ki Bong allowed a homer out of the park.

437
00:25:54,499 --> 00:25:58,171
And our first love came to a sad end.

438
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,188
That's pathetic.

439
00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:07,649
What about you, Woo Shik? Did you ask her out?

440
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,310
That's none of your business.

441
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:14,141
That brat.

442
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:16,840
What's going on?

443
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,747
What's with him?

444
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:21,459
I don't know. He does that whenever we talk about Soo Yeon.

445
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,550
I know.

446
00:26:24,329 --> 00:26:26,400
Who is it? Oh, it's the action director.

447
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,423
Hello.

448
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,451
One more person?

449
00:26:31,329 --> 00:26:32,828
Yes, there is.

450
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:35,442
Okay. See you later.

451
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,338
Hey, you don't have any training today, do you?

452
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:40,508
- I don't. Why? - An action director I know...

453
00:26:40,509 --> 00:26:41,679
is looking for an extra urgently.

454
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,731
Come with me.

455
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,938
- You said here. - Okay, there.

456
00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:52,376
Here. Seriously.

457
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:53,710
Here we go.

458
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,889
Shooting is not a joke.

459
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,129
All right.

460
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,129
Quiet, everyone.

461
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,768
Listen up.

462
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:05,229
In this scene, the cops discover...

463
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,669
the gang's hideout in the mountain,

464
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:08,768
and they get into a fight.

465
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:11,369
Just do as we rehearsed.

466
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,479
Then there'll be no problem.

467
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,578
Do you understand?

468
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:14,879
- Yes. - Okay.

469
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,103
Let me see.

470
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:20,649
Well, what was your name again?

471
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:23,607
- It's Kook Ki Bong. - Right, Ki Bong.

472
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,102
Since you're a beginner,

473
00:27:26,259 --> 00:27:28,689
after getting hit by a rod swung by a cop,

474
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,281
and die instantly. You need to die on the spot.

475
00:27:31,329 --> 00:27:33,659
Okay? Don't close your eyes. You must not close your eyes.

476
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,159
Open your eyes wide, and die on the spot.

477
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,229
You want me to die with my eyes open?

478
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,178
Didn't I just tell you to die on the spot?

479
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,669
- On the spot! - Okay.

480
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,969
Next, Jun Ho will...

481
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,928
- It's Jun Ki, sir. Lee Jun Ki. - Right, Jun Ki.

482
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:47,223
I'm sorry, Jun Ki. I forgot.

483
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:49,808
Jun Ki, you'll be fighting with the cops...

484
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:53,083
and hold the fire extinguisher right here and die on the spot!

485
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,949
- You'll die on the spot too. - Die on the spot!

486
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,149
- On the spot. - Yes, I understand.

487
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,883
Do you understand? Okay, we're all clear, right?

488
00:27:59,859 --> 00:28:01,348
- Die on the spot. - Wait a second.

489
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:04,722
- What did you say your name was? - Sorry?

490
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:07,687
Act like it's your first time.

491
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:11,098
- It's Kook Ki Bong. - Right, Ki Bong.

492
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:13,181
Right, it was Ki Bong.

493
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,310
Ki Bong, what shall we do with you?

494
00:28:15,499 --> 00:28:19,578
Since you're a beginner, after getting hit by a rod swung by a cop,

495
00:28:19,579 --> 00:28:22,364
- you'll die on... - You told me earlier.

496
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:24,209
You told me to die on the spot.

497
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,449
Did I already say that? Right, Ki Bong.

498
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,949
You have to die on the spot. You must not close your eyes.

499
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,649
- And Jun Bong will... - I said it's Jun Ki. Lee Jun Ki.

500
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,118
- Right, Jun Ki. - Jun Ki.

501
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:36,629
Jun Ki, you'll be fighting with the cops...

502
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,429
and hold the fire extinguisher right here...

503
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,858
You told me just now. I have to die on the spot.

504
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:43,654
- Lee Jun Ki dies on the spot. - Oh, did I already say that?

505
00:28:44,769 --> 00:28:45,998
Die on the spot, okay?

506
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:47,673
Are we all clear? Okay.

507
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,038
Director, we're all ready now.

508
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,169
The director is him.

509
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,148
- I'm the director. - Sir, we're all ready.

510
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:54,838
This is going to be tough.

511
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:57,806
Jun Ki, isn't that guy kind of strange?

512
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,102
He's always like that.

513
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,695
He hurt his head in the past while doing a stunt scene.

514
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:04,119
- His memory only lasts 3 seconds. - I see.

515
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,242
You should understand.

516
00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:08,513
So all you have to do is die on the spot!

517
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:09,881
Die on the spot!

518
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,288
You little punk. I'm going to kill you on the spot.

519
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:13,422
Come over here!

520
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,293
- Die on the spot! - Hey!

521
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,585
Get ready, action!

522
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,971
Don't follow me!

523
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:46,653
That stings!

524
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,444
Get off me. Thank you.

525
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,162
Darn it!

526
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,002
Die on the spot.

527
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:08,151
- Goodness. - Pick it up!

528
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,173
Hold on.

529
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:12,915
Die on the spot.

530
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,751
Don't come near me!

531
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:49,141
Hey, don't!

532
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,423
Don't. Don't come near me!

533
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,822
No!

534
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:55,121
Don't!

535
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,585
- Cut! - Be quiet.

536
00:31:09,549 --> 00:31:11,379
Director, there seems to be a problem with the fire extinguisher.

537
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,603
I'm the director!

538
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,149
Hey, cut!

539
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,507
Hey, Ki Bong!

540
00:31:15,849 --> 00:31:17,518
- Goodness. - My eyes!

541
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,610
Goodness me.

542
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,389
Hey, open your eyes.

543
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,613
- Open your eyes. - It stings.

544
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:25,179
It stings too much, and I can't open my eyes.

545
00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:26,998
I can't open my eyes.

546
00:31:26,999 --> 00:31:30,729
So why did you spray your own face with the fire extinguisher?

547
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,939
I told you to die on the spot, not spray it all over the place.

548
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,020
I'm sorry.

549
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,695
Hold on. Hey.

550
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,413
Goodness, this is so upsetting. Hold this.

551
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,881
Hold this and get some rest. Okay?

552
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,840
- Thank you. - This is so upsetting.

553
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,775
Who is this guy next to you? I've never seen him.

554
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:56,229
How many times did I tell you he's my friend?

555
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,760
Oh, I see. Your friend?

556
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,300
But what brings you here?

557
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,122
He came here to shoot a scene...

558
00:32:03,829 --> 00:32:06,757
- He just came to hang out. - I see, I came to hang out.

559
00:32:07,499 --> 00:32:09,651
I'm glad you're here. Have fun.

560
00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:11,131
Are you enjoying it?

561
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,230
- Enjoying it? - What's the next scene?

562
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,909
The next scene will be from there...

563
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,072
Okay, then...

564
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:20,661
Hey. What are you guys doing here?

565
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:21,949
Aren't you going to start shooting?

566
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:25,489
We hurt our eyes, and you told us to get some rest.

567
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:28,789
Did I? I said that?

568
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:33,199
Oh, right. I'm sorry. You should get some rest.

569
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,598
What's the next scene?

570
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:37,199
- Seriously, this is terrible. - Didn't we already shoot that?

571
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,831
His condition has gotten worse.

572
00:32:39,069 --> 00:32:41,283
My eyes. My eyes.

573
00:32:41,569 --> 00:32:43,939
- My eyes. - My eyes...

574
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,459
- I can't open my eyes. - This is all your fault.

575
00:32:58,589 --> 00:33:01,884
I told you to eat slowly.

576
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,311
Okay.

577
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,113
Why? Do you feel nervous being with me?

578
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:10,891
What?

579
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:12,791
Oh, yes.

580
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,423
You're so cute.

581
00:33:16,339 --> 00:33:20,216
Anyhow, I should've figured out how you felt earlier.

582
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:29,213
I can't imagine how tough it would've been for you all this time.

583
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,048
I'm sorry, Mr. Cha.

584
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:34,551
No. I'm sorry...

585
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:39,844
- Woo Shik. - Woo Shik?

586
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,469
This is driving me nuts.

587
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,985
Cha Woo Shik. How long will you keep this up?

588
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,440
No matter how desperate you were for your rent, this isn't right.

589
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:52,669
Okay. I should tell her the truth.

590
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,308
- Ma'am. - Yes?

591
00:33:54,309 --> 00:33:55,667
I have something to tell you.

592
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,994
- What is it? - Well, it's...

593
00:33:58,849 --> 00:33:59,941
Hold on.

594
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,643
Hello?

595
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,466
What? It was a lie?

596
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:10,331
Of all things, don't you know I can't stand anyone lying to me?

597
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:13,691
What do you think?

598
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,863
Throw him in prison this instant!

599
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,705
How dare he lie to me.

600
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:21,654
There's no need to show mercy to trash like him.

601
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,866
I'll use all my money if I have to to take him down.

602
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:27,287
I don't care if it takes 100, or 1,000 lawyers.

603
00:34:27,509 --> 00:34:29,141
Make him rot in a dark and cold cell...

604
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,148
until the day he dies.

605
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:46,224
I'm sorry.

606
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:50,343
It's another tenant, and he lied to me.

607
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,017
The thing I hate most in this world...

608
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:55,065
is when people lie.

609
00:34:55,899 --> 00:34:59,888
By the way, didn't you say you had something to say to me?

610
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,761
Well...

611
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,036
I just hope time stops for us at this moment.

612
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,586
Oh, my. Gosh, you're silly.

613

614
00:35:31,569 --> 00:35:32,691
I fell asleep.

615
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,109
My eyes.

616
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,280
My eyes...

617
00:35:44,089 --> 00:35:46,436
Wait. Why is it so quiet?

618
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,682
Hello?

619
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:51,270
Hello? Is anyone there?

620
00:35:51,629 --> 00:35:52,710
Hello?

621
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,240
Hello? Director?

622
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:58,922
Director?

623
00:35:59,169 --> 00:36:01,209
- Is anyone there? - Oh my gosh!

624
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:05,289
What's wrong with you? Why are you suddenly shouting?

625
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,933
I'm sorry.

626
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:10,270
Hey, this feels strange. I don't think anyone is here.

627
00:36:10,479 --> 00:36:13,318
What if they left us behind after finishing the shoot?

628
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:14,400
What?

629
00:36:14,549 --> 00:36:17,088
Hey. Hurry up and call the director.

630
00:36:17,089 --> 00:36:19,059
Okay, that's a good idea.

631
00:36:25,089 --> 00:36:26,211
Are you calling him?

632
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,591
- What? - What?

633
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:34,199
You idiot, the staff said they would keep our phones, don't you remember?

634
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,838
Right. Hey, what do we do then?

635
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:38,981
How would I know, you stupid jerk?

636
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,978
I can't even see properly. What should we do?

637
00:36:43,979 --> 00:36:45,337
Wait.

638
00:36:45,879 --> 00:36:47,247
Hello?

639
00:36:48,479 --> 00:36:49,918
- Anyone? - Anyone?

640
00:36:50,189 --> 00:36:51,418
Hello?

641
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:53,806
- We're stranded in here! - Anyone?

642
00:36:53,819 --> 00:36:55,418
- Hello? - Please!

643
00:36:55,419 --> 00:36:58,489
- Anyone? - We're trapped inside here!

644
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,611
Help!

645
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,593
This feels nice.

646
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,607
I don't even remember when I walked with a man for the last time.

647
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:16,180
But what's with all that cold sweat?

648
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,878
- Are you sick? - What? No.

649
00:37:20,149 --> 00:37:22,597
- It's not that. - If it's not that...

650
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:28,338
You're unbelievable.

651
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:29,880
How sweet of you.

652
00:37:32,029 --> 00:37:33,081
Here you go.

653
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,280
You should've just told me if you had wanted to link arms.

654
00:37:36,569 --> 00:37:37,621
You're silly.

655
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,945
This is insane.

656
00:37:47,479 --> 00:37:49,449
She's throwing a fit if she finds out the truth.

657
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:51,674
This is wrong.

658
00:37:52,149 --> 00:37:53,169
It's not right.

659
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,178
I'd rather go to jail.

660
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,120
I can't ignore my morals anymore.

661
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,040
Ma'am.

662
00:38:00,589 --> 00:38:01,858
I have something to tell you.

663
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:03,256
What is it?

664
00:38:03,729 --> 00:38:04,829
I actually...

665
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:06,114
Mom!

666
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:08,134
Hey! Son!

667
00:38:25,779 --> 00:38:28,228
Woo Shik, say hi.

668
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,672
This is my son.

669
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,388
- Hello. - Mom!

670
00:38:34,919 --> 00:38:36,898
Son!

671
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,529
(Bravery)

672
00:38:57,049 --> 00:38:59,378
Woo Shik, say hi.

673
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:00,604
This is my second son.

674
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:01,939
Hello...

675
00:39:02,419 --> 00:39:03,572
Hi.

676
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,979
Who is he?

677
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:09,243
I'm seeing him from today.

678
00:39:09,419 --> 00:39:11,559
Sons, you understand me, right?

679
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,354
Of course. As long as that's what you want.

680
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:17,929
But what if he approached you for money like the last time?

681
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,499
No way.

682
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:22,490
He told me that he has had a crush on me for half a year.

683
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,508
But he's finally mustered up his courage to tell me.

684
00:39:25,509 --> 00:39:26,906
That's good, then.

685
00:39:27,979 --> 00:39:28,999
Hey, you.

686
00:39:30,649 --> 00:39:33,026
If you make her cry, it'll be the end for you.

687
00:39:33,279 --> 00:39:36,482
He's not that type of person.

688
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:41,144
Didn't you say you had something to tell me?

689
00:39:41,189 --> 00:39:42,209
What is it?

690
00:39:44,689 --> 00:39:46,424
Actually...

691
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:55,073
I just wanted to say that I don't want to go home.

692
00:39:56,299 --> 00:39:58,482
My kids are watching us.

693
00:39:58,669 --> 00:40:01,260
Stop being silly.

694
00:40:02,379 --> 00:40:03,399
You're so sweet.

695
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,219
Jun Ki, wait for me.

696
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,515
Come quick.

697
00:40:11,919 --> 00:40:13,552
Where are we?

698
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:16,628
Are we going in the right direction?

699
00:40:16,629 --> 00:40:18,958
We should've just waited there.

700
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:20,735
He could come back for us.

701
00:40:21,129 --> 00:40:22,761
What? Come back for us?

702
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:25,269
I've known him for the past eight years.

703
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:27,769
But he still doesn't know my name.

704
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:29,398
A guy like that wouldn't come back for us.

705
00:40:29,399 --> 00:40:31,539
But we can't even see properly. How can we go home?

706
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:34,179
We can try hitchhiking.

707
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,508
Just follow me.

708
00:40:35,509 --> 00:40:36,631
Fine.

709
00:40:40,379 --> 00:40:42,082
- Hold on. - What now?

710
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:44,719
I think I have a stomachache.

711
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,933
I told you to eat little.

712
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,418
You had three whole bowls.

713
00:40:48,419 --> 00:40:50,195
I couldn't help it, I was hungry!

714
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,528
Is there a toilet somewhere?

715
00:40:52,529 --> 00:40:55,499
How would we know that when we can't even see properly?

716
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,795
We're in the middle of nowhere.

717
00:40:56,799 --> 00:40:58,199
Just go anywhere.

718
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,423
Fine.

719
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,599
Do you have some tissue?

720
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,838
Why would I have tissue in the middle of a mountain?

721
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,508
Just wipe with your tie.

722
00:41:06,509 --> 00:41:07,529
Fine.

723
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,938
Why are you yelling at me?

724
00:41:08,939 --> 00:41:11,459
How can I not be?

725
00:41:12,209 --> 00:41:13,300
Oh no. It hurts.

726
00:41:14,479 --> 00:41:15,805
I'll stay here. Come quick.

727
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,440
- What's this? - It hurts.

728
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,525
I found tissue!

729
00:41:29,799 --> 00:41:31,768
Let's play the silent 007 game.

730
00:41:31,799 --> 00:41:33,798
Fine. You lose if you make a sound.

731
00:41:33,799 --> 00:41:34,921
I'm going first.

732
00:41:50,689 --> 00:41:52,627
My stomach!

733
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,010
My stomach!

734
00:42:05,299 --> 00:42:07,279
It's quiet here. I guess there isn't anyone around.

735
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,832
I almost went in my pants.

736
00:42:12,209 --> 00:42:14,454
Right, I don't have any tissue!

737
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:38,920
Who's there?

738
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,965
Ki Bong!

739
00:42:47,709 --> 00:42:50,565
I found tissue!

740
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:54,623
What's wrong with him?

741
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:57,688
What is that sound?

742
00:42:57,689 --> 00:43:01,024
- Are you with someone? - Jun Ki!

743
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,676
I pooped.

744
00:43:09,529 --> 00:43:12,763
I still have no money, my eyes got injured,

745
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,376
and I got humiliated.

746
00:43:16,669 --> 00:43:18,372
What kind of life is this?

747
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:20,677
You're still better off than me.

748
00:43:21,339 --> 00:43:24,410
I'm going to the amusement park with our landlady...

749
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,308
and her sons tomorrow.

750
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:28,859
They asked me if I could buy cotton candy for her.

751
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,729
I have two sons now.

752
00:43:32,149 --> 00:43:34,710
Why is life so tough for us?

753
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,671
We've tried our best.

754
00:43:38,729 --> 00:43:41,209
I don't know why things are only going worse.

755
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:46,483
We were so well off back in the days.

756
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,190
Right?

757
00:43:48,299 --> 00:43:49,565
Yes.

758
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,369
At that time, I thought that, by now,

759
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:57,389
I'd be performing at the Carnegie Hall...

760
00:43:57,609 --> 00:44:00,119
with a big orchestra behind me.

761
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,749
I thought I'd be in Hollywood...

762
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:03,818
and win Oscars.

763
00:44:03,819 --> 00:44:05,686
I thought I'd be in the major league by now...

764
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:09,124
and play alongside Ryu Hyun Jin and Choo Shin Soo.

765
00:44:12,229 --> 00:44:13,555
But this can't be...

766
00:44:14,759 --> 00:44:17,249
the end for us, right?

767
00:44:18,129 --> 00:44:19,251
We shouldn't...

768
00:44:19,799 --> 00:44:21,369
give up yet, right?

769
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:23,769
Of course not. I'll never give up.

770
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:26,524
Of course. I can't give up now.

771
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,679
I have to at least strike out Choo Shin Soo once in my life.

772
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,700
Hey.

773
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:32,123
Let's not do that to fellow Koreans.

774
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:34,418
Be kind to Choo.

775
00:44:34,419 --> 00:44:35,418
You're right.

776
00:44:35,419 --> 00:44:36,471
Really?

777
00:44:36,819 --> 00:44:37,911
Then...

778
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:41,659
I won't give up until I get a home run from Choo.

779
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:43,220
- That sounds better. - You stupid jerk.

780
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,270
Let's cheer up.

781
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:54,734
"Success is for those who don't give up."

782
00:44:54,899 --> 00:44:57,011
That's an old quote from a saint.

783
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:00,039
Yes, let's try until the end.

784
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,608
Things will work out somehow.

785
00:45:01,609 --> 00:45:04,278
Woo Shik, who's "Saint"?

786
00:45:04,279 --> 00:45:05,331
What?

787
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:07,725
The quote that you said.

788
00:45:07,879 --> 00:45:09,247
You said it's from a "Saint".

789
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,059
I didn't know "Sai" was a last name for Koreans.

790
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:14,489
I don't think I've ever seen anyone with that last name before.

791
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:16,889
- Why you little... - Don't do it.

792
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:19,408
It's only going to frustrate you more.

793
00:45:19,729 --> 00:45:21,059
Let's just go to sleep.

794
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,487
Fine.

795
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,369
Hold on.

796
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:25,654
Take me with you.

797
00:45:25,729 --> 00:45:28,249
Tell me who that "Saint" is.

798
00:45:28,439 --> 00:45:30,909
A scientist? A Chinese person?

799
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:33,388
- Be quiet! - Take me with you!

800
00:45:33,509 --> 00:45:35,141
I can't see, either.

801
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,309
Easy, easy!

802
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:39,635
My eyes are burning.

803
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:41,640
Wait.

804
00:45:46,419 --> 00:45:48,119
I can see now!

805
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,476
I can see things now.

806
00:45:51,129 --> 00:45:53,333
Thank goodness.

807
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,357
Why do you live like that?

808
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:56,928
What's wrong with you guys?

809
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,260
What about Woo Shik?

810
00:46:01,569 --> 00:46:02,621
Woo Shik?

811
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:11,154
He went out somewhere.

812
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,372
Mom!

813
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,889
Let's ride this merry-go-round one more time.

814
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:24,816
- One more time! - Again?

815
00:46:25,259 --> 00:46:26,453
Woo Shik.

816
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:28,941
You don't mind if we ride this one more time, do you?

817
00:46:29,899 --> 00:46:32,582
- You're the best! - You're so cool!

818
00:46:43,979 --> 00:46:48,977
(Your wedding)

819
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:50,489
Oh yeah.

820
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:52,249
Let me get some first.

821
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:54,019
Just work at a ramyeon company if you like it so much.

822
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,688
Let me take some.

823
00:46:55,689 --> 00:46:57,128
Don't take it all.

824
00:46:57,129 --> 00:46:59,858
- Don't take too much! - I barely took any.

825
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:01,696
- I'm back. - Sit and have some ramyeon.

826
00:47:05,029 --> 00:47:07,753
Did you have fun?

827
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:10,980
You look great with the headband.

828
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,919
Did you buy cotton candy to your new sons?

829
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:15,708
Did your sons call you...

830
00:47:15,709 --> 00:47:17,249
the best stepdad for getting them cotton candy?

831
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:19,014
"Daddy!"

832
00:47:20,779 --> 00:47:21,901
Stop laughing!

833
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:24,912
What is this?

834
00:47:25,649 --> 00:47:26,741
What is all this?

835
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:30,493
How could those grownups love the merry-go-round so much?

836
00:47:30,859 --> 00:47:33,716
We rode it more than 30 times.

837
00:47:34,459 --> 00:47:36,397
Hang in there...

838
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:38,628
until we can afford to pay for the rent and the repair.

839
00:47:38,629 --> 00:47:39,956
- He's right. - What?

840
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,618
That's 10,000 dollars in total.

841
00:47:42,899 --> 00:47:45,508
You want me to keep doing this until we have that money?

842
00:47:45,509 --> 00:47:49,208
Would you rather we sleep on the street in this cold?

843
00:47:49,209 --> 00:47:52,413
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

844
00:47:53,049 --> 00:47:55,121
- Who is it now? - What is it?

845
00:47:55,919 --> 00:47:57,144
Eat up.

846
00:47:58,689 --> 00:47:59,842
Hi.

847
00:48:00,189 --> 00:48:02,402
What? Really?

848
00:48:03,259 --> 00:48:05,299
Okay. I'll be right there.

849
00:48:06,529 --> 00:48:07,699
What happened?

850
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,429
A wedding planner I know needs a singer.

851
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:11,599
She wants me to fill in.

852
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,068
You're leaving right now?

853
00:48:13,069 --> 00:48:16,569
- Have some ramyeon first. - Is it time for me to have ramyeon?

854
00:48:17,709 --> 00:48:19,954
I'm going to make money...

855
00:48:20,169 --> 00:48:23,168
and get out of this humiliating situation.

856
00:48:24,009 --> 00:48:26,426
You guys shouldn't idle around like this.

857
00:48:26,649 --> 00:48:29,332
Go out and make some money! Right now!

858
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:36,619
I have to go to work.

859
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:39,721
Hey, wait for me! Wait!

860
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:45,969
Sit here and eat.

861
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:53,412
- Hey. - Oh, you're here.

862
00:48:53,439 --> 00:48:55,179
I'm sorry for the short notice.

863
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:58,579
- The singer got in an accident. - I appreciate it.

864
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,249
I needed some money.

865
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:01,878
You did? That's great.

866
00:49:01,879 --> 00:49:04,418
Meet the bride and groom first. Follow me.

867
00:49:04,419 --> 00:49:05,511
Okay.

868
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:08,858
- Thank you. - You look beautiful.

869
00:49:08,859 --> 00:49:10,829
Your dress is gorgeous.

870
00:49:11,259 --> 00:49:14,084
- Don't forget the bouquet. - Thank you.

871
00:49:26,169 --> 00:49:27,362
Han Soo Yeon?

872
00:49:28,109 --> 00:49:29,639
Snap out of it.

873
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,730
Let me introduce you to the bride.

874
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:32,574
Ms. Han.

875
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,863
Hey, what are you doing?

876
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:40,021
- Are you crazy? - Hey.

877
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,783
Let's get out of here. Right now. Please.

878
00:49:44,529 --> 00:49:46,258
What are you talking about?

879
00:49:46,259 --> 00:49:47,830
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

880
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:51,053
Ms. Han, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

881
00:49:51,129 --> 00:49:54,669
Hey, stop it! What are you doing?

882
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,984
Put me down!

883
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:00,461
- What is this all about? - I'm sorry.

884
00:50:00,709 --> 00:50:04,044
I'm really sorry, but please find another person. I have to go.

885
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,909
Where do you think you are going?

886
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:08,194
- What's wrong? - Please don't ask anything.

887
00:50:08,419 --> 00:50:10,548
- Just let me go. - The wedding is in 30 minutes.

888
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,284
Where can I find a singer to fill in?

889
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:15,378
- Also, you need money. - That's true, but...

890
00:50:15,819 --> 00:50:16,941
I can't do this.

891
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:18,514
I'm so sorry.

892
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:21,023
Fine.

893
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:22,958
I'll pay you double. 1,000 dollars.

894
00:50:22,959 --> 00:50:25,568
This is not about money.

895
00:50:25,569 --> 00:50:27,304
- 1,500. - I can't.

896
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:28,991
2,000.

897
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:33,496
Fine, whatever. That's all I can pay you.

898
00:50:34,109 --> 00:50:35,231
Gosh.

899
00:50:38,149 --> 00:50:39,230
Stop...

900
00:50:40,879 --> 00:50:43,226
I have a favor to ask.

901
00:50:47,301 --> 00:50:50,769
Hello. I'd like to take out a loan.

902
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,622
My job?

903
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:54,862
I don't have any.

904
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:57,185
Security? I have nothing.

905
00:50:58,281 --> 00:50:59,362
A car?

906
00:51:00,111 --> 00:51:01,273
I do have one.

907
00:51:01,451 --> 00:51:05,249
It's called Rebecca. It's from either 2001 or 2002.

908
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:07,667
Hello? Hello?

909
00:51:09,321 --> 00:51:11,636
Gosh, they hung up on me again.

910
00:51:13,091 --> 00:51:15,760
Even banks look down on me now.

911
00:51:15,761 --> 00:51:16,953
(Loans)

912
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,834
- All right. - What are you doing?

913
00:51:19,861 --> 00:51:21,499
How can you...

914
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,369
How many portions are there?

915
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:26,003
Eight.

916
00:51:26,071 --> 00:51:29,201
We need energy to make money.

917
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,945
Fine. Eat as much as you want.

918
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:35,636
It's hot.

919
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:40,776
I wish some money could fall from the sky.

920
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:47,059
Recently, a meteorite fell on a green house...

921
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:49,360
- on a farm. - We got one here too.

922
00:51:49,361 --> 00:51:51,400
- A meteorite is a lottery ticket. - A "lottery ticket"?

923
00:51:51,401 --> 00:51:53,559
- Let's buy a lottery ticket. - A 50g meteorite...

924
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,641
was once sold for 500,000 dollars.

925
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,800
The outside is severely blackened,

926
00:51:57,801 --> 00:52:00,300
and the inside is denser than a normal rock,

927
00:52:00,301 --> 00:52:02,070
which suggests that it is highly likely to be a meteorite.

928
00:52:02,071 --> 00:52:03,091
(500g Meteorite Sold for 500,000 Dollars)

929
00:52:03,471 --> 00:52:05,724
500,000 dollars?

930
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:08,474
It's true.

931
00:52:08,951 --> 00:52:10,715
I swear.

932
00:52:10,821 --> 00:52:12,789
It fell down to our guesthouse a few days ago.

933
00:52:13,281 --> 00:52:14,412
Yes.

934
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:15,810
Yes.

935
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:18,573
I know where that coffee shop is.

936
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:21,001
See you later. Bye.

937
00:52:21,861 --> 00:52:24,260
- What did he say? - He collects meteorites.

938
00:52:24,261 --> 00:52:26,750
He wants to see our baby and buy it from us.

939
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:28,801
- Let's go. - Hold on.

940
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:33,038
- Are we going with Rebecca? - Yes.

941
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:34,745
I don't want to get in that car.

942
00:52:35,461 --> 00:52:38,183
It smells so bad.

943
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,133
You'll hurt her feelings.

944
00:52:41,331 --> 00:52:43,849
Cut it out. She doesn't smell. You smell worse. Let's go.

945
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:45,867
- It smells really bad. - Hurry.

946
00:52:46,271 --> 00:52:48,311
You stink.

947
00:52:51,211 --> 00:52:52,292
Let's go.

948
00:52:55,311 --> 00:52:56,879
What is this?

949
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,210
Don't worry.

950
00:52:58,211 --> 00:53:00,770
She's upset because you said she smells bad.

951
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,555
Close it. Let's go.

952
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:04,912
I'm sorry.

953
00:53:08,061 --> 00:53:10,029
Don't worry.

954
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,436
You just have to close it gently. As if you take care of a baby.

955
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:16,255
I'm sorry, Rebecca. Gently.

956
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:20,430
Is this AI?

957
00:53:20,771 --> 00:53:23,839
Don't worry. Let's close them at the same time.

958
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:24,963
At the same time.

959
00:53:25,771 --> 00:53:28,535
All right. 1, 2, 3.

960
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:30,602
Oh, my.

961
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:37,020
- Jun Ki. - My goodness.

962
00:53:37,021 --> 00:53:38,719
We're so lucky.

963
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,812
I know.

964
00:53:39,921 --> 00:53:42,190
By the way, how much should we ask for?

965
00:53:42,191 --> 00:53:45,251
The news said that a 500g one was sold for 500,000 dollars.

966
00:53:45,331 --> 00:53:47,504
This would be worth about a million dollars.

967
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:48,926
- A million? - Wait.

968
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,435
- 2 million? - 2 million?

969
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,845
Let me think. With the money,

970
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,208
- we'll pay the rent first. - The rent.

971
00:53:58,541 --> 00:54:01,810
I feel sorry for Rebecca, but I'll buy a gorgeous car too.

972
00:54:01,811 --> 00:54:02,909
I'm sorry.

973
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:04,237
What else?

974
00:54:04,311 --> 00:54:07,049
First of all, I'll go to a fancy buffet...

975
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:08,949
- and eat as much as I want. - That sounds great.

976
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:11,319
And then I'll go to a fancy sushi place...

977
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,290
and eat as much sushi as I want. After that,

978
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:16,931
- I'll go to a fancy beef place... - Hold on.

979
00:54:17,021 --> 00:54:18,183
What are you doing right now?

980
00:54:19,691 --> 00:54:21,435
This meteorite is mine.

981
00:54:21,601 --> 00:54:23,232
Why are you planning those things?

982
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,627
What do you mean?

983
00:54:26,271 --> 00:54:27,729
Why is this yours?

984
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:31,569
It fell on my guesthouse.

985
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:32,710
Didn't you guys say that?

986
00:54:32,711 --> 00:54:35,109
I'm the CEO, and you guys are just investors.

987
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:37,750
I just need to return your investments.

988
00:54:37,751 --> 00:54:39,949
Then it should belong to the landlady.

989
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:41,787
How would she find out about this?

990
00:54:43,351 --> 00:54:45,432
I'll tell her.

991
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:47,735
- Are you crazy? - What are you going to do?

992
00:54:48,061 --> 00:54:50,234
Are you going to divide it 50-50 or what?

993
00:54:50,731 --> 00:54:53,137
If not, I'll call her right now.

994
00:54:53,291 --> 00:54:55,199
Stop it. Seriously.

995
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,067
So answer me.

996
00:54:57,231 --> 00:55:00,668
Otherwise, I'll push "Call".

997
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,975
- What do you say? - Fine.

998
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,469
You really want to do this?

999
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:07,239
Go ahead. Do it.

1000
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,382
Oh, right?

1001
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,647
I'll push it. Do you see that?

1002
00:55:11,711 --> 00:55:13,310
- It's pushed halfway. - Do it!

1003
00:55:13,311 --> 00:55:15,580
- It's about to ring. - Do it!

1004
00:55:15,581 --> 00:55:16,620
As soon as I take my finger off,

1005
00:55:16,621 --> 00:55:18,350
- it'll connect. - Do it!

1006
00:55:18,351 --> 00:55:19,650
Stop it!

1007
00:55:19,651 --> 00:55:21,060
- Hey! - Stop it!

1008
00:55:21,061 --> 00:55:23,060
So divide it 50-50.

1009
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:28,689
Divide it. You're driving!

1010
00:55:29,901 --> 00:55:33,746
The star of the day, the bride will enter soon.

1011
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:35,773
A round of applause, please.

1012
00:55:35,871 --> 00:55:37,604
The bride enters.

1013
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,383
She's still pretty.

1014
00:56:06,871 --> 00:56:09,594
I'm singing at my first love's wedding for money.

1015
00:56:09,771 --> 00:56:13,075
This is just unbelivable.

1016
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,352
You're savage. How can you bite my arm?

1017
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:19,631
I can't believe you.

1018
00:56:20,211 --> 00:56:22,362
And you're a terrible driver.

1019
00:56:23,021 --> 00:56:26,794
Hey, it's 50-50.

1020
00:56:27,021 --> 00:56:28,928
If you try anything funny,

1021
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:33,407
I'm going to call the landlady right away.

1022
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:35,641
- Do you understand? - Okay, fine.

1023
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,159
You're so mean!

1024
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,426
Get off the car.

1025
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:41,994
Hold on. Why are you taking this?

1026
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,124
Let's hold it together.

1027
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,609
Are you doubting me?

1028
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,140
You think I'll take this and run away?

1029
00:56:47,141 --> 00:56:49,630
I know you're more than capable of doing that.

1030
00:56:50,081 --> 00:56:51,101
Get off.

1031
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:54,009
How can we get off when we're both holding this thing?

1032
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,203
Why can't we?

1033
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,006
I'll get off this way then.

1034
00:56:57,621 --> 00:56:59,487
- Get off. - Fine, I will.

1035
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:02,759
Hey, get off slowly.

1036
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,565
- Get off. - I'm trying my best...

1037
00:57:06,731 --> 00:57:08,536
Hey, Jun Ki! Jun Ki!

1038
00:57:11,871 --> 00:57:13,370
Come over here.

1039
00:57:13,371 --> 00:57:15,277
I told you not to try anything funny.

1040
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,969
- Give it to me. - I won't run away.

1041
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:19,827
- Hold it together. - I'm not going anywhere.

1042
00:57:20,981 --> 00:57:22,367
Do you really have to do this?

1043
00:57:22,641 --> 00:57:24,895
People are staring at my meteorite.

1044
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:27,358
Then let go of it. I can take it on my own.

1045
00:57:27,521 --> 00:57:30,420
Forget it. You're not even my friend anymore, you punk.

1046
00:57:30,421 --> 00:57:33,073
Since we're not friends, let's not talk down to each other then.

1047
00:57:33,191 --> 00:57:34,659
Mr. Lee Jun Ki.

1048
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,920
Goodness, I'm sorry, Mr. Kook Ki Bong.

1049
00:57:36,921 --> 00:57:38,690
Too bad. The cafe is that way.

1050
00:57:38,691 --> 00:57:40,560
No, it's not. It's that way.

1051
00:57:40,561 --> 00:57:41,830
- Follow me this way. - It's this way.

1052
00:57:41,831 --> 00:57:43,230
Let go of it.

1053
00:57:43,231 --> 00:57:44,429
Let go!

1054
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:45,798
Oh, gosh.

1055
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:48,807
My two million dollars. My meteorite.

1056
00:57:49,541 --> 00:57:51,244
No, no!

1057
00:57:51,671 --> 00:57:52,732
My two million dollars.

1058
00:57:53,141 --> 00:57:54,915
What if it's worth only one million dollars now?

1059
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:57,421
Are you okay? What if it's broken?

1060
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:00,031
Hey.

1061
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:01,471
Hey!

1062
00:58:03,421 --> 00:58:04,441
What are you doing?

1063
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:06,872
What are you doing?

1064
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:16,181
Han Soo Yeon...

1065
00:58:20,529 --> 00:58:21,722
There she is.

1066
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:28,065
It's really Soo Yeon.

1067
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:30,616
My first love is really getting married.

1068
00:58:33,909 --> 00:58:35,063
This feels strange.

1069
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,598
I know. Only if we'd told her how we truly felt,

1070
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:41,502
one of us three might be standing next to her right now.

1071
00:58:43,179 --> 00:58:45,801
- Right? - It could've been me.

1072
00:58:45,949 --> 00:58:48,540
Next, it's time for a congratulatory song.

1073
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:50,352
A big round of applause, please.

1074
00:58:57,870 --> 00:58:58,890
What is that?

1075
00:58:59,629 --> 00:59:01,506
What on earth is that?

1076
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:03,999
What a unique way to sing a congratulatory song.

1077
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,108
Were you all surprised?

1078
00:59:05,109 --> 00:59:07,209
- What is this, "The Masked Singer"? - Actually, this person is...

1079
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,408
a new singer who is about to make his debut.

1080
00:59:09,409 --> 00:59:11,858
He insisted that his face must not be revealed.

1081
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,578
We hope you to understand.

1082
00:59:13,779 --> 00:59:16,167
Then, it's time to listen to his performance.

1083
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:17,340
Please give him a hand.

1084
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:24,154
Originally, there was a song that the bride and groom requested.

1085
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:27,871
But I'm not familiar with that song, so I prepared something else.

1086
00:59:44,379 --> 00:59:47,102
I am happy

1087
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:51,185
When I met you

1088
00:59:51,489 --> 00:59:55,601
It was a gift that

1089
00:59:55,659 --> 00:59:58,459
This world gave me

1090
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:01,858
My love

1091
01:00:01,859 --> 01:00:06,051
I love you

1092
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:12,632
Even if the world splits us apart

1093
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:20,956
My love, I love you

1094
01:00:21,679 --> 01:00:27,769
Even if my life comes to an end

1095
01:00:30,489 --> 01:00:31,550
What are you doing here?

1096
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:33,211
Soo Yeon.

1097
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:35,808
Did I startle you? Sorry.

1098
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,698
What are you doing?

1099
01:00:37,699 --> 01:00:41,139
Oh, this? I'm arranging a song that I'll sing at a performance.

1100
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:42,322
You perform too?

1101
01:00:42,569 --> 01:00:43,738
Can I go watch then?

1102
01:00:43,739 --> 01:00:46,068
Sure. Of course you can.

1103
01:00:46,069 --> 01:00:47,269
I'll give you an invitation.

1104
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:49,626
Really? Thank you.

1105
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:53,651
The next song has been requested by Han Soo Yeon of Class 2-3.

1106
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,860
It's "I Love You" by Lee Jae Hoon.

1107
01:00:56,549 --> 01:00:57,815
I requested that song.

1108
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:00,243
Woo Shik, how do you like this song?

1109
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,535
- It's nice. - It's my favorite song.

1110
01:01:04,089 --> 01:01:05,150
It is?

1111
01:01:06,259 --> 01:01:09,298
Shall I practice this song and sing it for you later?

1112
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:11,779
Are you serious? You promised me.

1113
01:01:13,299 --> 01:01:14,319
Promise me.

1114
01:01:38,029 --> 01:01:45,547
My love, I love you

1115
01:01:46,299 --> 01:01:52,940
Even if my life comes to an end

1116
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:04,608
I sincerely congratulate you on your marriage.

1117
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:06,342
By the way, Ms. Han,

1118
01:02:07,219 --> 01:02:09,300
I wish you happiness.

1119
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:13,817
Goodbye, Soo Yeon.

1120
01:02:14,029 --> 01:02:15,222
Be happy, Soo Yeon.

1121
01:02:15,299 --> 01:02:18,468
Next, the bride and groom will pay their respect to...

1122
01:02:18,469 --> 01:02:20,099
- their parents for raising them. - Good job.

1123
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,395
You saved me today.

1124
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,399
Here. This is for your performance.

1125
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,968
It's okay. I kept my promise, and that's enough.

1126
01:02:25,969 --> 01:02:27,806
Promise? What promise?

1127
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,591
- What about this money? - Give it to her as a gift.

1128
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:37,157
Hey, it's the king.

1129
01:02:37,850 --> 01:02:39,176
We enjoyed your song.

1130
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:42,713
Ki Bong, Jun Ki.

1131
01:02:44,859 --> 01:02:46,869
- Who are you? - It's me!

1132
01:02:48,129 --> 01:02:49,527
Woo Shik, what are you doing here?

1133
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,999
You're the masked singer who sang for Soo Yeon?

1134
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,295
Well, it's...

1135
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:56,527
Why are you guys here then?

1136
01:02:56,799 --> 01:02:57,931
And what is that stone?

1137
01:02:59,239 --> 01:03:00,801
Well, what happened was...

1138
01:03:01,879 --> 01:03:03,608
Forget it. It's a long story.

1139
01:03:03,609 --> 01:03:04,778
Let's go out and talk.

1140
01:03:04,779 --> 01:03:06,544
Okay. Let's go outside.

1141
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:09,076
Hey.

1142
01:03:09,779 --> 01:03:11,147
Hurry up.

1143
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:13,818
- Watch out. - Who is that?

1144
01:03:13,819 --> 01:03:14,911
What's happening?

1145
01:03:16,989 --> 01:03:18,591
Hey, you...

1146
01:03:20,529 --> 01:03:22,999
Who is he? What's going on now?

1147
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,938
I saw this scene often in movies.

1148
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,769
Hey, what if it's Soo Yeon's ex-boyfriend?

1149
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:28,892
Come on.

1150
01:03:28,969 --> 01:03:31,662
Sir, your company has gone bankrupt! Get out of here!

1151
01:03:32,239 --> 01:03:33,468
Get out of here, sir!

1152
01:03:33,469 --> 01:03:35,581
- Bankrupt? - Jun Ki, what does that mean?

1153
01:03:35,739 --> 01:03:36,759
Goodness.

1154
01:03:48,589 --> 01:03:50,936
Soo Yeon, you should go somewhere safe for now.

1155
01:03:57,230 --> 01:03:58,657
My meteorite!

1156
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,683
Why is that your meteorite? It's my two million dollars.

1157
01:04:01,699 --> 01:04:03,539
- You promised to split it. - My money.

1158
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:04,897
- No. - My two million dollars.

1159
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:06,434
What do you mean, two million dollars?

1160
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:08,239
What are you talking about?

1161
01:04:08,379 --> 01:04:09,909
Hey, move!

1162
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:25,820
My cellphone is totally broken.

1163
01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:30,158
My meteorite. My meteorite...

1164
01:04:30,159 --> 01:04:33,434
My two million dollars. My two million dollars. ...

1165
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:37,568
Who in the world took my money?

1166
01:04:37,569 --> 01:04:39,039
Why did you bring that thing here?

1167
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,008
Who expected this to happen?

1168
01:04:41,009 --> 01:04:42,336
And listen.

1169
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:43,639
It's a courtesy...

1170
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:46,607
to wish your first love happiness when she gets married.

1171
01:04:46,909 --> 01:04:48,613
Look at you. What about you?

1172
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:51,127
You even put on a mask to sing a song for her.

1173
01:04:51,279 --> 01:04:53,649
I just did that to make some money.

1174
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:55,496
Whatever! I don't care.

1175
01:04:56,690 --> 01:04:58,730
Guys, for one last time,

1176
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,713
let's look at the security cameras again. One last time.

1177
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:04,968
- One last time. - We already checked ten times.

1178
01:05:04,969 --> 01:05:05,999
Let's go home.

1179
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,369
One last time, please.

1180
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:09,543
- Just give up. - One last time...

1181
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:12,778
Who knows?

1182
01:05:13,069 --> 01:05:14,130
Hurry up.

1183
01:05:17,339 --> 01:05:18,370
Hold on.

1184
01:05:19,009 --> 01:05:20,070
Jun Ki.

1185
01:05:20,609 --> 01:05:22,579
Wasn't the trunk open earlier?

1186
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:23,579
I don't care!

1187
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:27,057
It opens and closes as it pleases.

1188
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:32,606
I want to go back!

1189
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:36,298
My two million dollars!

1190
01:05:36,299 --> 01:05:39,972
The wedding was a mess.

1191
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:44,139
She showed off so much about how rich she was,

1192
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:46,408
but people came to demand their money back.

1193
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:48,888
It was a total mess.

1194
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:51,948
- I'm an idiot for believing you. - Be quiet!

1195
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:54,008
We blew two million dollars.

1196
01:05:54,009 --> 01:05:56,778
- Why is this car so dirty? - What about you?

1197
01:05:56,779 --> 01:05:57,878
Stop fighting, you two!

1198
01:05:57,879 --> 01:05:59,655
- This darn car. - Quiet!

1199
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:01,889
- Stop fighting. - You be quiet, too.

1200
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:03,388
We blew two million dollars.

1201
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,050
Darn.

1202
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:11,428
You call this a car?

1203
01:06:11,429 --> 01:06:13,234
It's basically an automatic door.

1204
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:14,550
Darn.

1205
01:06:15,199 --> 01:06:16,424
Are you okay?

1206
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,361
Why is this door open?

1207
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,078
- Leave it. There's nothing in it. - Get rid of this junk!

1208
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:28,088
Step into the house.

1209
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,401
What is that sound? Wait.

1210
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:34,387
- Is that coming from the car? - Why would the car make sounds?

1211
01:06:35,619 --> 01:06:38,019
Are you going crazy now?

1212
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:40,334
- Just come here. - Quick.

1213
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:42,923
Hold on.

1214
01:06:43,459 --> 01:06:46,285
Why does it keep making sounds?

1215
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:18,368
What are you doing?

1216
01:07:18,369 --> 01:07:21,225
There's someone inside.

1217
01:07:21,230 --> 01:07:23,137
What are you talking about? Let me see.

1218
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,309
You better not be joking with the meteorite.

1219
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:27,483
I'm traumatized by a meteorite today, okay?

1220
01:07:28,379 --> 01:07:29,971
What would be there?

1221
01:08:06,829 --> 01:08:09,482
(Welcome to Waikiki 2)

1222
01:08:10,029 --> 01:08:13,238
You have to leave a good impression. You haven't seen her in 10 years.

1223
01:08:13,239 --> 01:08:14,939
Do we really have the time to care about our first loves right now?

1224
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:17,568
- Woo Shik! - Is she really your girlfriend?

1225
01:08:17,569 --> 01:08:19,609
- Should I just stay here tonight? - What?

1226
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:21,650
She has gone crazy.

1227
01:08:21,709 --> 01:08:23,749
She has gone crazy.

1228
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:25,878
I really want to pee badly.

1229
01:08:25,879 --> 01:08:27,878
- Action! - Are you Bi Dam?

1230
01:08:27,879 --> 01:08:30,195
- You don't need to know. - Hold on. Director!

1231
01:08:30,289 --> 01:08:31,589
Look at all the dust.

1232
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:33,589
Get a grip!

1233
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:34,916
You're telling me to go in there?

1234
01:08:35,129 --> 01:08:37,259
We're trapped.

1235
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:39,729
- What is all of this? - What do you think?

1236
01:08:39,730 --> 01:08:41,738
It's all for you.

1237
01:08:41,829 --> 01:08:43,665
- Hey. - I'm sorry.

1238
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:45,123
There's nothing I can do.

1239
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,269
- Who is this? - Us?

1240
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:49,514
We're the ones who liked Soo Yeon. Why?
