1
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:14,630
What? Did you do something crazy last night?

2
00:00:14,631 --> 00:00:17,762
Well, the thing is, I got drunk and told Soo Yeon...

3
00:00:18,502 --> 00:00:19,631
that I like her.

4
00:00:19,632 --> 00:00:20,693
That you like her?

5
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:23,471
So, how did it go? What did Soo Yeon say?

6
00:00:23,472 --> 00:00:25,480
I don't know. I don't remember after that.

7
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:27,398
Jun Ki, what should I do?

8
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:42,070
Hey, Woo Shik.

9
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:46,331
About last night...

10
00:00:46,332 --> 00:00:49,423
Soo Yeon, the thing is...

11
00:00:49,502 --> 00:00:50,654
How did we come home?

12
00:00:52,731 --> 00:00:54,101
I don't remember anything.

13
00:00:54,102 --> 00:00:56,101
What? You don't remember?

14
00:00:56,102 --> 00:00:57,906
- Since when? - Well...

15
00:00:58,871 --> 00:01:01,524
I can't recall anything since we left that chicken feet restaurant.

16
00:01:03,582 --> 00:01:05,141
Did I make a mistake or something?

17
00:01:05,142 --> 00:01:07,110
No. Not at all.

18
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:08,508
What a relief.

19
00:01:08,951 --> 00:01:11,328
I was worried I might have made some kind of mistake.

20
00:01:12,182 --> 00:01:14,435
I better wash up and pull myself together.

21
00:01:18,992 --> 00:01:20,216
Gosh, I'm so relieved.

22
00:01:22,192 --> 00:01:24,344
How long are you going to keep this up?

23
00:01:24,402 --> 00:01:26,370
Aren't you going to tell her how you feel?

24
00:01:26,531 --> 00:01:27,724
The thing is...

25
00:01:28,572 --> 00:01:30,275
I don't have the courage yet.

26
00:01:31,671 --> 00:01:34,263
I'll tell her later on.

27
00:01:35,572 --> 00:01:39,559
(Should I Tell You I Love You Again?)

28
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:42,229
Please, please, please.

29
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:44,727
Why are you doing this to me?

30
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:49,071
Ki Bong! Why are you home so early?

31
00:01:49,251 --> 00:01:51,961
- What about work? - I had to come and get something.

32
00:01:51,962 --> 00:01:53,083
Is that so?

33
00:01:53,162 --> 00:01:54,895
Hey, what do you think?

34
00:01:54,992 --> 00:01:57,131
You invested in this truck for me,

35
00:01:57,132 --> 00:01:59,375
so I've been cleaning it since this morning.

36
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:02,721
- Doesn't it look spick and span? - It does.

37
00:02:02,871 --> 00:02:04,024
Come on.

38
00:02:04,302 --> 00:02:06,617
- Why are you so down today? - Well...

39
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:10,274
My manager said he'll fire me if I can't sell a car this week...

40
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:12,720
- and I still haven't sold any. - Really?

41
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:14,805
Oh, no.

42
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:17,958
Where can I find someone who needs a car?

43
00:02:18,581 --> 00:02:20,590
What's wrong with you today, Rebecca?

44
00:02:20,951 --> 00:02:23,001
Are you mad at me for something?

45
00:02:23,692 --> 00:02:24,783
What are you doing?

46
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,827
Rebecca won't start.

47
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:29,422
Maybe it's broken?

48
00:02:29,961 --> 00:02:32,601
Of course not! My Rebecca is strong!

49
00:02:32,602 --> 00:02:33,730
Strong, my foot.

50
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:36,352
It opens by itself and doesn't run properly.

51
00:02:37,042 --> 00:02:39,041
Right, Jun Ki.

52
00:02:39,102 --> 00:02:40,672
How about you buy a new car?

53
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:42,435
Are you crazy?

54
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:43,911
She'll hear you!

55
00:02:43,912 --> 00:02:46,054
Don't you know how long she can stay mad for?

56
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:47,844
Cars can't hear you.

57
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:49,757
Don't you feel sorry for Rebecca?

58
00:02:49,822 --> 00:02:51,555
She's more than 20 years old!

59
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,217
I bet she wants to rest, too.

60
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:55,857
- Do you think so? - Of course!

61
00:02:57,092 --> 00:02:58,245
You know,

62
00:02:59,562 --> 00:03:02,183
there's a really nice new model out.

63
00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:03,856
Take a look.

64
00:03:10,171 --> 00:03:13,302
Oh, my gosh! You're back, Rebecca!

65
00:03:13,472 --> 00:03:15,411
What? It started on its own.

66
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:17,788
See? I told you she's still going strong.

67
00:03:17,942 --> 00:03:19,481
Then you're not going to get a new car?

68
00:03:19,551 --> 00:03:21,551
Why would I? She's still fine.

69
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:25,381
If, in the future,

70
00:03:25,382 --> 00:03:27,621
my Rebecca dies,

71
00:03:27,622 --> 00:03:29,601
then I'll buy a car from you, all right?

72
00:03:30,592 --> 00:03:32,937
Rebecca, you're back.

73
00:03:33,132 --> 00:03:34,865
My Rebecca is back.

74
00:03:35,762 --> 00:03:38,790
Brother, I told you to be gentle.

75
00:03:39,472 --> 00:03:42,330
Why did you clean it all day? You should've gone easy on it.

76
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:45,809
How could I? Ki Bong invested his last salary in it for me.

77
00:03:46,412 --> 00:03:48,841
I'm going to work really hard...

78
00:03:48,842 --> 00:03:51,361
and pay him back for sure.

79
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:53,881
I guess you've finally come to your senses.

80
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:56,733
- Are the preparations going well? - Of course.

81
00:03:57,021 --> 00:04:01,234
But I need to get a permit and some other things beforehand.

82
00:04:02,122 --> 00:04:03,285
I'm home.

83
00:04:03,762 --> 00:04:04,843
Is that you, Soo Yeon?

84
00:04:07,491 --> 00:04:10,725
- Who is he? - He's the new producer.

85
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:12,800
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

86
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:14,872
- What brings you here? - It's just that...

87
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:17,541
Soo Yeon got hurt during the shoot.

88
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:18,671
Hurt? Where?

89
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:21,611
I hurt my ears while filming at the shooting range.

90
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:23,511
Your ears? Shouldn't you get them checked?

91
00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:26,878
No, I just had slight tinnitus, but it's fine now. Don't worry.

92
00:04:27,512 --> 00:04:29,419
Thank you for giving me a ride.

93
00:04:29,482 --> 00:04:32,751
It's nothing. Are you sure you'll be okay tomorrow?

94
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:34,689
We can find another reporter in your place.

95
00:04:34,891 --> 00:04:37,160
No, I'll be fine. Really.

96
00:04:37,161 --> 00:04:38,855
All right, then. Take care.

97
00:04:38,961 --> 00:04:41,691
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning. See you then.

98
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:43,803
- All right. - Okay. Good bye.

99
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,425
- See you. - All right.

100
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:48,168
I'll go and take a rest.

101
00:04:49,302 --> 00:04:51,239
Give it here. I'll help you.

102
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:52,470
I can handle it.

103
00:04:52,471 --> 00:04:53,696
Let's go, Soo Yeon.

104
00:04:54,312 --> 00:04:55,433
Thanks.

105
00:05:05,482 --> 00:05:07,633
Are you sure you'll be fine tomorrow?

106
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:09,654
- Why don't you rest for a few days? - I can't.

107
00:05:09,822 --> 00:05:11,621
I barely got this place as a regular.

108
00:05:11,622 --> 00:05:14,212
I can't have it taken from me.

109
00:05:14,862 --> 00:05:17,758
- And I'm fine, so don't worry. - All right.

110
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:20,219
- Go on and get some rest. - Okay.

111
00:05:26,442 --> 00:05:27,563
Come here for a second.

112
00:05:28,372 --> 00:05:29,640
What's wrong with you?

113
00:05:29,641 --> 00:05:32,059
I have a bad feeling about this.

114
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,631
- About what? - That producer.

115
00:05:34,882 --> 00:05:36,718
The way he brought her home...

116
00:05:36,752 --> 00:05:38,588
and the way he gazed at Soo Yeon.

117
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:41,369
I'm pretty sure he's interested in her.

118
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:45,121
No way. He's just a colleague.

119
00:05:45,122 --> 00:05:48,498
Colleagues are the most dangerous ones.

120
00:05:48,531 --> 00:05:49,960
They work together all day,

121
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:51,631
they eat together, and have dinner parties together.

122
00:05:51,632 --> 00:05:55,170
That's when colleagues become "Darling" and "Honey".

123
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:57,136
- That's how it begins. - Really?

124
00:05:57,201 --> 00:05:59,822
So hurry up and tell her how you feel.

125
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:03,400
Don't you know timing is everything when it comes to love?

126
00:06:03,482 --> 00:06:05,787
Tell her how I feel? No, forget it.

127
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:13,990
Woo Shik. What's up?

128
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:17,584
I was just wondering how you were doing.

129
00:06:18,391 --> 00:06:20,790
- What are you up to? - I couldn't fall asleep,

130
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,660
so I was revising the script for tomorrow.

131
00:06:22,661 --> 00:06:23,854
Is that so?

132
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:26,770
That's...

133
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:30,340
About the producer... What's he like?

134
00:06:30,341 --> 00:06:31,494
The producer?

135
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:35,789
He's kind and friendly.

136
00:06:36,242 --> 00:06:39,984
He's good looking, too, so he's popular among the staff.

137
00:06:40,552 --> 00:06:41,806
I see.

138
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:43,552
Why do you ask?

139
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:45,382
It's nothing.

140
00:06:47,422 --> 00:06:49,706
Soo Yeon, I have...

141
00:06:50,062 --> 00:06:51,725
something to tell you.

142
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:54,580
You do? What is it?

143
00:06:54,692 --> 00:06:55,783
What?

144
00:06:56,362 --> 00:06:59,666
The thing is...

145
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:02,354
I...

146
00:07:03,502 --> 00:07:04,868
What is it?

147
00:07:05,242 --> 00:07:06,333
Hurry up and tell me.

148
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:07,635
All right.

149
00:07:08,612 --> 00:07:09,907
Soo Yeon.

150
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:11,934
Soo Yeon, the thing is,

151
00:07:12,911 --> 00:07:15,605
I think...

152
00:07:20,422 --> 00:07:22,023
Soo Yeon, what's wrong?

153
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,544
I can't hear you.

154
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:26,456
- I can't hear anything. - What?

155
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,087
What do you mean?

156
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,056
All of a sudden?

157
00:07:34,531 --> 00:07:35,695
Stop it, already.

158
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,501
Why are you sighing so much?

159
00:07:37,502 --> 00:07:39,643
I'm going to get fired if I don't sell a car by the end of the week...

160
00:07:39,911 --> 00:07:41,298
and I couldn't today, either.

161
00:07:41,372 --> 00:07:42,493
Really?

162
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,816
That's too bad. What are you going to do?

163
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,796
I don't know. I need some air.

164
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,713
- What happened? - It's all right.

165
00:07:52,851 --> 00:07:55,952
I don't know what's wrong, but she keeps getting the wrong buttons.

166
00:07:56,661 --> 00:07:58,906
What a mess.

167
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:01,660
Then what do I press to open the windows?

168
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:04,030
For the windows, you press... I don't know.

169
00:08:04,031 --> 00:08:07,091
- What? - But it's best to keep them closed.

170
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:09,411
Many were victims of that window.

171
00:08:10,002 --> 00:08:11,296
Then turn on the air conditioner.

172
00:08:12,101 --> 00:08:14,866
What? Why does the radio come on when I turn the air conditioner on?

173
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,614
It's all right.

174
00:08:16,812 --> 00:08:18,741
It'll be fun to listen to the radio.

175
00:08:18,742 --> 00:08:19,833
Gosh.

176
00:08:20,882 --> 00:08:23,329
Then what do I press for the air conditioner?

177
00:08:24,622 --> 00:08:26,009
I can't see!

178
00:08:26,221 --> 00:08:27,680
What now?

179
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:29,321
I can't see the road!

180
00:08:29,322 --> 00:08:30,994
I can't see! I can't see!

181
00:08:33,932 --> 00:08:35,258
My goodness.

182
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:37,830
Oh, my.

183
00:08:38,132 --> 00:08:39,907
What is it?

184
00:08:40,202 --> 00:08:42,068
Is my Rebecca not doing well?

185
00:08:42,132 --> 00:08:44,549
Not a single part is fine with this car.

186
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:47,111
Are you really telling me this car worked?

187
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:50,305
Sure. It was fine right up until the accident.

188
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:53,434
Is that so? By the looks of it,

189
00:08:53,982 --> 00:08:55,543
you won't be able to use it anymore.

190
00:08:56,681 --> 00:08:58,050
You should scrap it.

191
00:08:58,051 --> 00:09:00,336
What? What do you mean, scrap it?

192
00:09:01,521 --> 00:09:03,664
What are you talking about?

193
00:09:04,161 --> 00:09:06,263
I can't take it. Get me another mechanic.

194
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:09,231
Bring out the skilled mechanic! Come on!

195
00:09:09,232 --> 00:09:10,762
Who's causing a commotion?

196
00:09:19,401 --> 00:09:22,838
Why are you making a fuss at a sacred repair shop?

197
00:09:23,811 --> 00:09:24,863
What's going on?

198
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:28,251
He kept telling me to fix a car...

199
00:09:28,252 --> 00:09:29,405
that's all worn out.

200
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:31,951
Who are you?

201
00:09:31,952 --> 00:09:33,247
Nice to meet you.

202
00:09:33,852 --> 00:09:35,860
I am Manager Jang Jun Hyuk...

203
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,655
of Master Car Repair.

204
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:41,231
He is the master of our repair shop.

205
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:42,354
Are you?

206
00:09:42,431 --> 00:09:45,961
Sir, please save my Rebecca.

207
00:09:45,962 --> 00:09:49,470
- First, let me check her condition. - Okay.

208
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:56,457
There's not a single part without a defect.

209
00:09:56,781 --> 00:09:59,140
And there's a serious problem...

210
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:01,049
that's been spread all throughout the insides.

211
00:10:01,551 --> 00:10:05,180
What have you been doing until now?

212
00:10:05,181 --> 00:10:07,435
I just thought it was a light breakdown.

213
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:11,837
Sir, does that mean you won't be able to save her?

214
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:15,305
I never said that.

215
00:10:15,832 --> 00:10:18,821
There's nothing impossible for me, Jang Jun Hyuk.

216
00:10:20,872 --> 00:10:24,472
I'll handle this repair myself.

217
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:27,283
Thank you, sir.

218
00:10:27,641 --> 00:10:28,936
Thank you so much.

219
00:10:48,962 --> 00:10:51,920
We will now begin the repair.

220
00:10:52,362 --> 00:10:53,932
- Screw wrench! - Screw wrench.

221
00:11:00,742 --> 00:11:02,608
- Screwdriver! - Screwdriver.

222
00:11:06,651 --> 00:11:08,141
- Pliers! - Pliers.

223
00:11:09,051 --> 00:11:10,306
Pull yourself together!

224
00:11:10,521 --> 00:11:11,777
I'm sorry, sir.

225
00:11:16,391 --> 00:11:17,544
Darn it!

226
00:11:17,722 --> 00:11:20,560
What are you doing? I can't see!

227
00:11:20,561 --> 00:11:22,428
- Rebecca is crying. - Suction!

228
00:11:23,832 --> 00:11:25,086
There's a problem.

229
00:11:25,232 --> 00:11:27,501
Various oil levels are getting low too rapidly.

230
00:11:27,502 --> 00:11:29,900
Stop fussing and put in five liters of engine oil...

231
00:11:29,901 --> 00:11:31,170
and 10 liters of transmission fluid immediately.

232
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:32,940
The battery is dead, sir.

233
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:34,135
Darn it.

234
00:11:34,311 --> 00:11:35,698
Let's revive the battery first.

235
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:37,617
- Get me jumper cables! - Yes, sir.

236
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:39,701
Press it.

237
00:11:41,181 --> 00:11:42,201
Clear!

238
00:11:42,712 --> 00:11:44,650
Rebecca.

239
00:11:44,651 --> 00:11:45,671
Clear!

240
00:11:46,821 --> 00:11:48,117
Rebecca.

241
00:11:49,452 --> 00:11:50,482
Clear!

242
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:52,616
Switch it to the maximum voltage!

243
00:11:53,122 --> 00:11:54,457
- Clear! - Rebecca!

244
00:11:54,762 --> 00:11:55,782
Rebecca!

245
00:11:58,102 --> 00:11:59,153
Clear!

246
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:04,701
Is she okay? What did the doctor say?

247
00:12:04,702 --> 00:12:07,211
Her eardrums are a bit damaged.

248
00:12:07,212 --> 00:12:08,770
She won't be able to hear well for a while.

249
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:10,984
But it's only temporary. After some medication and rest,

250
00:12:11,342 --> 00:12:12,667
she'll be fine.

251
00:12:12,882 --> 00:12:14,483
That's a relief.

252
00:12:14,952 --> 00:12:16,655
Soo Yeon, go in and get some rest.

253
00:12:17,222 --> 00:12:18,302
What did you say?

254
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:20,344
Get some rest!

255
00:12:20,722 --> 00:12:23,240
- What? - You can go in, Soo Yeon.

256
00:12:24,321 --> 00:12:25,485
Go in?

257
00:12:26,992 --> 00:12:28,389
Too bad she hurt her ears.

258
00:12:28,862 --> 00:12:31,101
Right. Did you ask her out?

259
00:12:31,102 --> 00:12:32,153
No.

260
00:12:32,301 --> 00:12:35,501
Just when I was about to, she stopped hearing.

261
00:12:35,502 --> 00:12:36,552
My goodness.

262
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:38,570
How can you be so unlucky?

263
00:12:38,571 --> 00:12:40,841
I don't know. Why just at that moment?

264
00:12:40,842 --> 00:12:41,932
Hello.

265
00:12:46,612 --> 00:12:47,632
Oh, hi.

266
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:49,581
What brings you here?

267
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:51,180
Soo Yeon texted me...

268
00:12:51,181 --> 00:12:52,711
she's having ear problems.

269
00:12:53,122 --> 00:12:54,785
I was worried, so I thought I'd stop by.

270
00:12:55,122 --> 00:12:56,290
Is she okay?

271
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,961
She just saw a doctor. She's resting right now.

272
00:12:57,962 --> 00:12:59,726
Really? Is she in her room?

273
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,091
Can I see her for a moment?

274
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:05,631
Well, the doctor said it's important that she gets good rest.

275
00:13:05,632 --> 00:13:07,162
I'm afraid you can't see her.

276
00:13:07,832 --> 00:13:10,525
I see. Then I'll have to come back tomorrow.

277
00:13:11,171 --> 00:13:13,170
Please give this porridge to her.

278
00:13:13,171 --> 00:13:14,471
Oh, sure.

279
00:13:14,472 --> 00:13:16,613
Well, see you.

280
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,561
See you.

281
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,779
See? What did I tell you?

282
00:13:20,911 --> 00:13:23,503
He ran here as soon as he found out Soo Yeon was sick.

283
00:13:23,582 --> 00:13:26,221
What if he asks Soo Yeon out before you do?

284
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,550
What am I supposed to do?

285
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:28,951
I can't ask her out when she can't even hear well.

286
00:13:28,952 --> 00:13:29,972
Why not?

287
00:13:30,492 --> 00:13:32,660
She can still see. You could text her.

288
00:13:32,661 --> 00:13:34,089
I can't ask her out over text.

289
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,354
Is it a bad idea?

290
00:13:36,391 --> 00:13:39,300
You saw the movie, "Love Actually", right?

291
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:40,731
In that movie, the man uses a sketchbook...

292
00:13:40,732 --> 00:13:42,842
to confess his feelings for the woman.

293
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,400
I thought it was so romantic.

294
00:13:44,401 --> 00:13:45,696
Cut it out!

295
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:47,678
A sketchbook? Don't be ridiculous.

296
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:57,832
(Soo Yeon, I have something to tell you.)

297
00:14:04,421 --> 00:14:06,328
(Soo Yeon, I have something to tell you.)

298
00:14:08,992 --> 00:14:10,082
Why can't I turn it over?

299
00:14:10,801 --> 00:14:11,821
Are they stuck together?

300
00:14:13,632 --> 00:14:14,692
Give me a second.

301
00:14:30,181 --> 00:14:31,201
Soo Yeon.

302
00:14:32,382 --> 00:14:33,402
Soo Yeon!

303
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:35,973
Are you okay?

304
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:40,190
What did the doctor say?

305
00:14:40,191 --> 00:14:42,375
Her corneas are scratched a little.

306
00:14:42,391 --> 00:14:44,361
If she uses eye drops for a few days and rests well,

307
00:14:44,362 --> 00:14:45,400
she'll be fine.

308
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:46,728
I see.

309
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:49,322
Soo Yeon.

310
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:51,373
Go in and rest.

311
00:14:52,202 --> 00:14:55,332
She can neither hear nor see anymore.

312
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:57,381
Jung Eun, take her inside.

313
00:14:57,411 --> 00:14:58,462
Okay.

314
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:01,581
Who are you? Who are you?

315
00:15:01,582 --> 00:15:03,723
- Don't worry. Calm down. - It's me.

316
00:15:04,252 --> 00:15:05,679
- It's me. - Jung Eun?

317
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:11,311
I can't believe this happened.

318
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:14,331
When you tried to ask her out in speech, she stopped hearing.

319
00:15:14,332 --> 00:15:16,372
When you tried in writing, her eyes got hurt.

320
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:18,930
Maybe you're not meant to ask her out.

321
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:19,951
Be quiet.

322
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,770
Are you going to give up like this?

323
00:15:22,771 --> 00:15:23,900
You want me to try again?

324
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:25,982
She can neither hear nor see. How can I ask her out?

325
00:15:27,872 --> 00:15:29,442
You could try writing on her palm.

326
00:15:30,071 --> 00:15:31,775
- Like this. - Are you crazy?

327
00:15:31,882 --> 00:15:33,751
Who asks a girl out like that?

328
00:15:33,752 --> 00:15:36,097
Fine, forget it.

329
00:15:36,281 --> 00:15:38,550
Even if you lose Soo Yeon to that producer...

330
00:15:38,551 --> 00:15:40,351
and come crying to me, I won't bat an eye.

331
00:15:40,352 --> 00:15:42,091
Don't blame me then, okay?

332
00:15:42,092 --> 00:15:43,479
Cut it out!

333
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:45,220
I'm not going to do that crazy thing just to ask her out.

334
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,444
Forget it!

335
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:53,691
Soo Yeon.

336
00:16:17,092 --> 00:16:19,468
No. This is not okay.

337
00:16:28,002 --> 00:16:29,562
They're finished.

338
00:16:31,171 --> 00:16:33,416
Sir, are you done with the repair?

339
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:35,211
How is Rebecca?

340
00:16:35,212 --> 00:16:38,649
We experienced some difficulties, but the repair was successful.

341
00:16:39,441 --> 00:16:41,421
Try starting the car.

342
00:16:41,482 --> 00:16:42,604
Yes, sir.

343
00:16:56,431 --> 00:16:57,553
The car won't start.

344
00:16:58,161 --> 00:16:59,324
It won't?

345
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:01,748
- What? - I thought it would.

346
00:17:01,931 --> 00:17:03,911
I guess it won't.

347
00:17:04,242 --> 00:17:05,292
What...

348
00:17:08,642 --> 00:17:10,039
What are you talking about?

349
00:17:10,242 --> 00:17:12,280
I heard you were the best mechanic here.

350
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,455
I'm a mechanic, not a deity.

351
00:17:14,682 --> 00:17:17,120
As you can see, this car cannot be saved...

352
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:18,916
even by the most modern car repair technologies.

353
00:17:19,351 --> 00:17:21,221
You'll have to let it go.

354
00:17:21,222 --> 00:17:22,242
What?

355
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:24,090
"Let it go"?

356
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:27,581
"Let it go"?

357
00:17:28,591 --> 00:17:29,652
Nonsense.

358
00:17:31,131 --> 00:17:32,151
No.

359
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:34,154
I don't believe it.

360
00:17:35,331 --> 00:17:36,351
I can't.

361
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:39,869
Jun Ki, calm down.

362
00:17:40,071 --> 00:17:41,163
You have no choice.

363
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:44,285
You have to let Rebecca go.

364
00:17:44,712 --> 00:17:45,732
I'm...

365
00:17:46,912 --> 00:17:49,328
not ready to let her go yet.

366
00:17:52,482 --> 00:17:53,820
You have to accept reality!

367
00:17:53,821 --> 00:17:55,760
This can't bring Rebecca back.

368
00:17:56,321 --> 00:17:57,515
My goodness.

369
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,059
By the way,

370
00:18:01,192 --> 00:18:02,864
do you remember that you promised me...

371
00:18:03,962 --> 00:18:06,684
you'd buy a car from me when Rebecca is gone?

372
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:11,234
Would you like to take a look at our catalog first?

373
00:18:13,002 --> 00:18:14,062
Here.

374
00:18:26,051 --> 00:18:28,642
Rebecca, is that you? Are you there?

375
00:18:29,152 --> 00:18:32,732
Ki Bong, did you just hear that? Rebecca just made a noise.

376
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,015
No, I didn't.

377
00:18:34,331 --> 00:18:35,820
You must be imagining it.

378
00:18:37,932 --> 00:18:38,983
Am I?

379
00:18:39,402 --> 00:18:40,453
Here.

380
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:48,546
Rebecca, is that you?

381
00:18:48,672 --> 00:18:50,270
Are you back alive?

382
00:18:50,271 --> 00:18:52,540
- No way. - This is a miracle.

383
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,061
Rebecca, you scared me.

384
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:56,173
Don't prank me like this again.

385
00:18:57,982 --> 00:18:59,175
Rebecca.

386
00:19:00,392 --> 00:19:02,697
Rebecca. Let's stay together forever.

387
00:19:11,002 --> 00:19:13,461
Ki Bong, now that Rebecca has revived,

388
00:19:13,462 --> 00:19:14,530
why don't we have some ramyeon?

389
00:19:14,531 --> 00:19:15,870
With eggs and ham and everything.

390
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:18,901
Forget it. I don't want to eat anything. You go ahead.

391
00:19:18,902 --> 00:19:20,574
Why are you being so crabby?

392
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,110
Rebecca, get some rest.

393
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:24,304
See you tomorrow.

394
00:19:28,982 --> 00:19:30,919
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

395
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:34,515
I have only two days left. Who am I going to sell a car to?

396
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,320
Is Rebecca immortal or something?

397
00:19:38,321 --> 00:19:39,954
Why does she keep reviving?

398
00:19:42,331 --> 00:19:43,351
Wait.

399
00:19:55,242 --> 00:19:58,781
All right. If I pull out the spark plug, the car won't start.

400
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:07,530
I'm sorry, Rebecca.

401
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,455
But I'm doing this for your sake.

402
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:12,146
This is getting too hard for you too, isn't it?

403
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,240
So don't hold a grudge against me,

404
00:20:15,531 --> 00:20:16,582
okay?

405
00:20:28,142 --> 00:20:31,202
Gosh, what's that noise?

406
00:20:34,252 --> 00:20:35,272
What is this?

407
00:20:39,182 --> 00:20:40,221
What is this?

408
00:20:40,222 --> 00:20:42,435
It's me. Rebecca.

409
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:45,943
Rebecca?

410
00:20:46,192 --> 00:20:47,391
What are you doing here?

411
00:20:47,392 --> 00:20:50,523
Jun Ki was so nice to me.

412
00:20:50,962 --> 00:20:54,501
Why did you do that to me? Why?

413
00:20:54,502 --> 00:20:55,592
I'm sorry.

414
00:20:56,601 --> 00:20:58,580
But it was getting too hard for you too.

415
00:20:58,771 --> 00:21:00,641
What I did was for your sake, so...

416
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:02,274
You're lying!

417
00:21:02,442 --> 00:21:05,237
It was not for my sake, but for your own.

418
00:21:05,412 --> 00:21:07,511
You did that so that you could sell a car...

419
00:21:07,512 --> 00:21:10,438
and keep your job. Isn't that right?

420
00:21:10,722 --> 00:21:12,151
Well...

421
00:21:12,152 --> 00:21:13,885
I'll never forgive you.

422
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:17,047
I'll destroy you!

423
00:21:19,222 --> 00:21:21,813
Give me back my spark plug.

424
00:21:22,262 --> 00:21:25,057
Give me back my spark plug.

425
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:30,201
Give me back my spark plug!

426
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,649
What? What's wrong?

427
00:21:39,142 --> 00:21:41,905
What? It's nothing.

428
00:21:43,012 --> 00:21:44,246
You scared me.

429
00:21:57,702 --> 00:21:58,926
Here you go.

430
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:05,295
Ta-da! Guys, try some of this.

431
00:22:06,371 --> 00:22:08,146
What is up with this spaghetti?

432
00:22:08,611 --> 00:22:09,671
What is this, Yu Ri?

433
00:22:09,672 --> 00:22:12,435
It's a new menu of Yu Ri's Kitchen I'll be selling from the food truck.

434
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:14,080
This is "Cherry Jubileegetti",

435
00:22:14,081 --> 00:22:15,886
and this is "Gone With the Wind Spaghetti".

436
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,648
What do you think? Don't they look yummy?

437
00:22:17,781 --> 00:22:21,015
- Go on and try them. - What? Oh, okay.

438
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:31,461
Wow. It looked really horrible,

439
00:22:31,702 --> 00:22:34,283
- but it's so delicious. - I'm telling you.

440
00:22:34,702 --> 00:22:37,803
I knew I didn't lose my touch.

441
00:22:41,571 --> 00:22:42,663
Where is Soo Yeon?

442
00:22:43,012 --> 00:22:44,205
She doesn't have an appetite.

443
00:22:44,381 --> 00:22:46,911
She's busy watching something on her laptop since this morning.

444
00:22:46,912 --> 00:22:48,034
Watch what?

445
00:22:49,111 --> 00:22:50,234
Wait.

446
00:22:50,682 --> 00:22:52,080
Does that mean her eyes are okay?

447
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:54,193
- Yes. She can see clearly now. - Really?

448
00:22:54,892 --> 00:22:56,044
That's great.

449
00:22:56,422 --> 00:22:57,952
Hey, brother. Brother!

450
00:22:58,021 --> 00:22:59,960
How could you go without trying all of this?

451
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:06,197
Ki Bong. Can you try this for him instead?

452
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:07,526
I'm sorry, but...

453
00:23:08,131 --> 00:23:10,478
I really don't have an appetite right now. I'm sorry.

454
00:23:10,771 --> 00:23:13,117
What? You don't have an appetite?

455
00:23:13,402 --> 00:23:15,818
- You've never been like this. - Well...

456
00:23:16,871 --> 00:23:19,187
I had nightmares all night and couldn't sleep.

457
00:23:19,512 --> 00:23:22,251
Rebecca!

458
00:23:22,252 --> 00:23:23,810
What? What was that sound?

459
00:23:23,811 --> 00:23:25,351
Wasn't that Jun Ki's voice?

460
00:23:25,452 --> 00:23:27,217
What's wrong with him? Is something wrong?

461
00:23:29,452 --> 00:23:31,664
Hey. What's the matter with you?

462
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:33,546
Something's wrong with Rebecca.

463
00:23:34,031 --> 00:23:36,031
I had no trouble starting her engine till yesterday,

464
00:23:36,732 --> 00:23:37,925
but she suddenly won't start.

465
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:39,955
This feels bad.

466
00:23:40,262 --> 00:23:42,311
I better call Manager Jang Jun Hyuk from Master Car Repair.

467
00:23:58,422 --> 00:24:00,462
Hey, Soo Yeon.

468
00:24:05,392 --> 00:24:06,789
- Soo Yeon. - My goodness.

469
00:24:09,331 --> 00:24:11,575
Woo Shik! Why?

470
00:24:11,932 --> 00:24:16,083
Soo Yeon, can you lower your voice a little bit? Your voice.

471
00:24:16,432 --> 00:24:17,523
What?

472
00:24:19,101 --> 00:24:21,355
My voice is too loud?

473
00:24:21,771 --> 00:24:22,965
Okay.

474
00:24:24,912 --> 00:24:26,064
Does this sound okay?

475
00:24:26,982 --> 00:24:29,011
No, it's still too loud.

476
00:24:29,012 --> 00:24:30,133
Way too loud.

477
00:24:30,551 --> 00:24:32,112
Can you tone it down a notch?

478
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:36,086
Does this sound okay?

479
00:24:36,121 --> 00:24:38,100
Yes. That sounds perfect.

480
00:24:39,262 --> 00:24:41,475
What were you just watching?

481
00:24:41,762 --> 00:24:43,425
I was monitoring another program.

482
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:46,106
The producer sent me a text earlier...

483
00:24:46,232 --> 00:24:49,027
and said he'd replace me with someone else until I'm okay.

484
00:24:49,472 --> 00:24:52,971
I'm worried she might take my spot so I want to try anything.

485
00:24:53,402 --> 00:24:56,299
But I can't understand a word because of my darn ears.

486
00:24:57,811 --> 00:24:58,934
By the way, what is it?

487
00:24:59,281 --> 00:25:00,669
Do you have something you want to ask?

488
00:25:03,412 --> 00:25:05,563
What? No, it's nothing.

489
00:25:06,222 --> 00:25:08,088
You should keep watching. Go on.

490
00:25:08,752 --> 00:25:09,873
Okay.

491
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:21,561
What am I thinking?

492
00:25:22,202 --> 00:25:23,629
She's going through enough already.

493
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:27,889
Isn't there any way I can help her?

494
00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:35,734
(Spray Cleaner, Car Polish, Ethanol Washer Fluid)

495
00:25:41,091 --> 00:25:42,173
Rebecca.

496
00:25:42,851 --> 00:25:45,473
This is your favorite fuel additive.

497
00:25:47,432 --> 00:25:50,348
I brought your favorite fuel additive.

498
00:25:51,061 --> 00:25:54,979
Why can't you take in any of this? Why?

499
00:25:56,101 --> 00:25:57,224
Why?

500
00:25:57,601 --> 00:25:59,376
Jun Ki, calm down.

501
00:26:00,172 --> 00:26:03,129
Although Rebecca is gone, you should keep living.

502
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:06,132
I know.

503
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,512
I know it too, but...

504
00:26:10,381 --> 00:26:12,870
I can't believe I won't be able to see...

505
00:26:14,222 --> 00:26:15,853
Rebecca ever again.

506
00:26:17,692 --> 00:26:18,844
Rebecca.

507
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:23,129
We've been through so much together all this time.

508
00:26:24,331 --> 00:26:25,454
Right?

509
00:26:25,902 --> 00:26:27,330
What is that car?

510
00:26:27,331 --> 00:26:29,239
I'm starting a drama shoot soon.

511
00:26:29,502 --> 00:26:31,072
So I got myself a car.

512
00:26:31,672 --> 00:26:33,987
Rebecca

513
00:26:35,341 --> 00:26:36,464
Good job.

514
00:26:52,662 --> 00:26:55,447
There you go. A sip for you, and a sip for me.

515
00:26:59,502 --> 00:27:03,582
I think I'm in love with you

516
00:27:04,442 --> 00:27:08,348
Rebecca! Rebecca...

517
00:27:10,982 --> 00:27:14,991
Jun Ki. Those who meet must part one day...

518
00:27:15,381 --> 00:27:17,453
and those who part will meet someone new.

519
00:27:18,881 --> 00:27:20,004
With that in mind,

520
00:27:23,121 --> 00:27:25,334
I've picked a really nice car for you.

521
00:27:27,321 --> 00:27:29,065
Do you want to take a look?

522
00:27:30,791 --> 00:27:31,882
Hang on.

523
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:34,805
I'd like to say my last goodbye...

524
00:27:35,702 --> 00:27:37,436
to Rebecca.

525
00:27:42,472 --> 00:27:45,777
I'm sorry you met such a bad owner like me.

526
00:27:47,381 --> 00:27:48,504
I'm sorry I made you suffer.

527
00:27:49,482 --> 00:27:50,807
In your next life,

528
00:27:52,152 --> 00:27:53,988
I hope you meet a better owner...

529
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:56,652
and I hope he tunes you up often...

530
00:27:58,321 --> 00:28:00,464
and feeds you a lot of premium gasoline.

531
00:28:02,031 --> 00:28:03,460
I hope you're happy.

532
00:28:05,932 --> 00:28:07,053
Then...

533
00:28:12,502 --> 00:28:15,092
Rebecca. Rebecca, was that you?

534
00:28:17,311 --> 00:28:18,434
Was that you, Rebecca?

535
00:28:22,611 --> 00:28:23,775
Rebecca!

536
00:28:25,152 --> 00:28:28,008
Ki Bong, Rebecca has come back alive.

537
00:28:28,492 --> 00:28:30,154
Rebecca has come back alive!

538
00:28:30,851 --> 00:28:33,340
What? This is ridiculous. Does this make sense?

539
00:28:33,722 --> 00:28:37,128
I'm certain I pulled out her spark plug. How could this happen?

540
00:28:37,331 --> 00:28:40,321
Rebecca, are you really alive? Are you?

541
00:28:44,402 --> 00:28:45,932
Rebecca is answering me.

542
00:28:46,371 --> 00:28:47,463
Rebecca.

543
00:28:50,672 --> 00:28:53,263
Rebecca is answering me.

544
00:28:54,182 --> 00:28:56,425
Rebecca! My Rebecca.

545
00:28:56,881 --> 00:28:58,483
- My Rebecca. - No way.

546
00:28:58,781 --> 00:28:59,945
This can't be.

547
00:29:10,361 --> 00:29:11,860
Why is he sleeping in here?

548
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:16,072
Brother, get up. Brother.

549
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:17,294
Yes. What?

550
00:29:20,202 --> 00:29:21,364
I fell asleep.

551
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:25,081
What were you doing all night in here?

552
00:29:26,811 --> 00:29:28,106
I had something to do.

553
00:29:30,712 --> 00:29:32,793
- What about Soo Yeon? - Soo Yeon?

554
00:29:32,881 --> 00:29:34,829
She just headed out for the broadcasting station.

555
00:29:35,422 --> 00:29:37,550
What? The broadcasting station? In that state?

556
00:29:37,551 --> 00:29:40,142
She said she's okay now. She can hear well too.

557
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:41,454
Already?

558
00:29:42,492 --> 00:29:43,858
I doubt that.

559
00:29:46,361 --> 00:29:48,676
How could she go shoot a program in that state?

560
00:29:51,402 --> 00:29:53,177
Wait. Soo Yeon!

561
00:29:55,642 --> 00:29:57,610
- Soo Yeon. - Woo Shik.

562
00:29:57,881 --> 00:30:00,839
- What are you doing here? - What? It's just...

563
00:30:01,412 --> 00:30:03,624
Are you really all right? Will you be okay shooting?

564
00:30:03,682 --> 00:30:05,864
Yes. I'm all cured now and my ears are okay too.

565
00:30:05,922 --> 00:30:09,721
Then let's go to the hospital and see if you're really okay or not.

566
00:30:09,722 --> 00:30:11,353
No, I'm really fine.

567
00:30:11,422 --> 00:30:14,530
I don't have time since I told the producer I'm coming to work.

568
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:15,653
See you then.

569
00:30:24,472 --> 00:30:25,624
Soo Yeon!

570
00:30:33,142 --> 00:30:34,916
Soo Yeon, are you okay?

571
00:30:35,152 --> 00:30:36,988
Soo Yeon. Soo Yeon.

572
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:43,945
I'm okay.

573
00:30:45,192 --> 00:30:46,619
You're not okay at all.

574
00:30:47,162 --> 00:30:48,763
Why are you so stubborn?

575
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:50,030
I'm sorry.

576
00:30:50,031 --> 00:30:52,918
Forget it. You can't go to work, so let's get you to the hospital.

577
00:30:53,131 --> 00:30:54,733
I have to go to work!

578
00:30:54,902 --> 00:30:56,870
What if someone else takes my spot?

579
00:30:56,871 --> 00:30:59,115
Still, how could you go in that state?

580
00:30:59,402 --> 00:31:00,870
Stop being so stubborn!

581
00:31:01,771 --> 00:31:02,996
Let go of me.

582
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,814
I'm telling you, I'm fine!

583
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:07,110
Why are you doing this when I'm saying I'm fine?

584
00:31:07,111 --> 00:31:09,193
- Who are you to do this? - Because I like you.

585
00:31:10,252 --> 00:31:13,006
You're always on my mind, and I'm worried about you.

586
00:31:15,851 --> 00:31:16,974
What?

587
00:31:18,992 --> 00:31:20,930
What did you just say?

588
00:31:26,131 --> 00:31:27,489
It's alive.

589
00:31:29,002 --> 00:31:30,100
What's wrong with him?

590
00:31:30,101 --> 00:31:32,040
I don't know. He's been like that for a while.

591
00:31:32,142 --> 00:31:34,344
Did he see a ghost or something?

592
00:31:37,611 --> 00:31:39,011
What's wrong with you?

593
00:31:39,012 --> 00:31:40,816
I...

594
00:31:41,781 --> 00:31:43,852
I did it. I got it over with.

595
00:31:43,912 --> 00:31:45,513
Got over with what?

596
00:31:47,482 --> 00:31:48,878
I told Soo Yeon how I feel about her.

597
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:50,342
Really?

598
00:31:50,392 --> 00:31:52,707
What do you mean you told Soo Yeon how you felt?

599
00:31:52,821 --> 00:31:55,191
What? You like Soo Yeon?

600
00:31:55,192 --> 00:31:56,416
Never mind.

601
00:31:56,762 --> 00:31:59,251
So what did she say? Come on.

602
00:31:59,402 --> 00:32:01,676
I don't know. I was so surprised that I ran away.

603
00:32:02,432 --> 00:32:05,196
What? You ran away afterwards?

604
00:32:05,771 --> 00:32:07,955
My mind went blank and I couldn't help it.

605
00:32:08,672 --> 00:32:10,243
What do I do?

606
00:32:14,611 --> 00:32:15,804
Hi, Soo Yeon.

607
00:32:19,351 --> 00:32:20,606
Woo Shik.

608
00:32:21,591 --> 00:32:23,183
Can I have a word with you?

609
00:32:25,021 --> 00:32:26,347
Okay.

610
00:32:30,371 --> 00:32:35,371

611
00:32:40,202 --> 00:32:42,252
I'm sorry for being stubborn back there.

612
00:32:42,871 --> 00:32:45,040
I guess I was anxious about my work...

613
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:47,081
and got unnecessarily stubborn.

614
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:50,310
It was nothing.

615
00:32:50,311 --> 00:32:52,981
I've never had something I wanted to do before,

616
00:32:52,982 --> 00:32:54,277
so I kept going after more.

617
00:32:56,252 --> 00:32:57,342
That happens.

618
00:32:58,192 --> 00:32:59,854
Woo Shik,

619
00:33:00,762 --> 00:33:02,628
I really enjoy my work...

620
00:33:03,131 --> 00:33:04,285
and it's really valuable to me.

621
00:33:06,101 --> 00:33:09,264
So I really want to work hard and be successful.

622
00:33:09,601 --> 00:33:11,201
Sure. Of course.

623
00:33:11,202 --> 00:33:12,598
That's why...

624
00:33:15,811 --> 00:33:18,566
I don't think I should be seeing anyone at the moment.

625
00:33:21,551 --> 00:33:23,521
Do you understand what I mean?

626
00:33:27,051 --> 00:33:28,112
Sure.

627
00:33:32,692 --> 00:33:35,211
We're still good friends, right?

628
00:33:36,861 --> 00:33:37,923
Of course.

629
00:33:38,262 --> 00:33:39,486
We're friends.

630
00:33:40,702 --> 00:33:42,538
Are you sure you'll be okay?

631
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:43,996
Sure!

632
00:33:44,502 --> 00:33:47,531
Don't worry about me, Soo Yeon. I'm fine.

633
00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:50,939
I'll get going, then.

634
00:33:52,341 --> 00:33:53,361
Okay.

635
00:34:03,192 --> 00:34:05,467
Brother. What did she say?

636
00:34:06,762 --> 00:34:08,221
I got dumped.

637
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:12,183
Really?

638
00:34:13,062 --> 00:34:15,111
Are you all right?

639
00:34:16,301 --> 00:34:17,556
What can I do?

640
00:34:18,102 --> 00:34:19,632
That's how she feels.

641
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,865
It's okay. I'm fine.

642
00:34:24,211 --> 00:34:29,006
(Between Love and Friendship)

643
00:34:32,921 --> 00:34:34,650
You look nice today. Are you going somewhere?

644
00:34:34,651 --> 00:34:36,456
I have a gig at a live cafe.

645
00:34:36,722 --> 00:34:37,772
I have to go.

646
00:34:38,022 --> 00:34:39,042
Wait a minute.

647
00:34:40,062 --> 00:34:41,530
You're leaving like this?

648
00:34:41,531 --> 00:34:43,163
You said I looked nice. Is something wrong?

649
00:34:46,861 --> 00:34:48,637
Gosh, just look at me.

650
00:34:53,202 --> 00:34:54,201
I'm going now.

651
00:34:54,202 --> 00:34:55,263
Hey!

652
00:34:57,142 --> 00:34:58,845
Not that.

653
00:34:59,812 --> 00:35:00,902
You...

654
00:35:02,381 --> 00:35:05,441
don't have any pants on.

655
00:35:06,182 --> 00:35:07,202
What?

656
00:35:09,852 --> 00:35:10,974
Oh, that's why.

657
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:13,116
What's wrong with me?

658
00:35:18,001 --> 00:35:19,083
What do we do?

659
00:35:20,461 --> 00:35:21,695
I'll be back after my gig.

660
00:35:21,932 --> 00:35:23,331
You're going to work?

661
00:35:23,332 --> 00:35:25,101
Why don't you rest today?

662
00:35:25,102 --> 00:35:26,440
You must have a lot on your mind.

663
00:35:26,441 --> 00:35:28,379
No, I'm really okay.

664
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:29,562
I'll be back soon.

665
00:35:35,481 --> 00:35:36,533
Hi, Woo Shik.

666
00:35:37,082 --> 00:35:38,714
- Are you going to work? - Yes.

667
00:35:41,151 --> 00:35:42,190
How about you?

668
00:35:42,191 --> 00:35:43,549
I'm going to the store.

669
00:35:44,591 --> 00:35:45,860
Should we leave together?

670
00:35:45,861 --> 00:35:47,350
I'm actually in a hurry.

671
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,612
I'll get going first.

672
00:35:59,571 --> 00:36:01,478
What will we do with them?

673
00:36:02,042 --> 00:36:03,670
Things will get so awkward, won't it?

674
00:36:03,671 --> 00:36:04,803
I guess.

675
00:36:05,182 --> 00:36:07,210
Will he really be all right?

676
00:36:07,211 --> 00:36:08,272
All right?

677
00:36:08,852 --> 00:36:11,229
He was just about to leave without any pants on.

678
00:36:11,312 --> 00:36:13,780
He swung on his guitar with just his underpants on.

679
00:36:13,781 --> 00:36:16,067
There's no way he'll be all right.

680
00:36:16,522 --> 00:36:18,791
My brother really liked Soo Yeon a lot.

681
00:36:18,792 --> 00:36:20,659
I know. I'm worried.

682
00:36:22,031 --> 00:36:24,661
Why don't you take him out...

683
00:36:24,662 --> 00:36:25,960
on a trip?

684
00:36:25,961 --> 00:36:28,471
Should we? It's my day off tomorrow.

685
00:36:28,472 --> 00:36:29,930
I have work tomorrow.

686
00:36:30,801 --> 00:36:32,340
"Here we go, Nice Man!"

687
00:36:32,341 --> 00:36:34,641
Do you? Then I'll take him by myself.

688
00:36:34,642 --> 00:36:35,732
You?

689
00:36:36,372 --> 00:36:38,411
I'm a bit skeptical.

690
00:36:38,412 --> 00:36:41,011
What? Why are you underestimating me?

691
00:36:41,012 --> 00:36:42,379
Don't worry.

692
00:36:42,452 --> 00:36:45,103
I'll make him feel much better.

693
00:36:45,651 --> 00:36:47,559
Trust me.

694
00:36:52,861 --> 00:36:54,860
The weather is amazing.

695
00:36:54,861 --> 00:36:56,218
Sure. I guess.

696
00:36:57,392 --> 00:37:00,461
Come on. Lighten up a bit.

697
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,331
Let's have fun today...

698
00:37:02,332 --> 00:37:04,271
and forget about everything. Okay?

699
00:37:04,272 --> 00:37:05,300
All right.

700
00:37:05,301 --> 00:37:07,240
Should we put up the tent?

701
00:37:07,772 --> 00:37:10,189
Hey, don't you dare.

702
00:37:10,372 --> 00:37:11,535
I got this.

703
00:37:13,012 --> 00:37:14,032
Just a moment.

704
00:37:15,352 --> 00:37:17,627
Hello? Yes, sir?

705
00:37:19,281 --> 00:37:20,373
What?

706
00:37:21,591 --> 00:37:23,223
Okay, sir.

707
00:37:26,591 --> 00:37:28,051
What's wrong? Who is it?

708
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,519
I got fired.

709
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,230
He said I won't have to come to work.

710
00:37:32,301 --> 00:37:33,321
Really?

711
00:37:33,401 --> 00:37:34,656
Well, it's no surprise.

712
00:37:35,071 --> 00:37:37,274
I only sold one car this month.

713
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:39,477
I would've fired myself, too.

714
00:37:42,772 --> 00:37:45,363
It wasn't easy to get in.

715
00:37:49,381 --> 00:37:51,288
I don't think you're in the mood for camping, either.

716
00:37:51,921 --> 00:37:53,207
Should we just head back?

717
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:56,244
What are you talking about? We're here to make you feel better.

718
00:37:56,622 --> 00:37:59,416
Don't worry about me. Let's just get the tent set up.

719
00:38:13,171 --> 00:38:14,223
It's finally done.

720
00:38:17,272 --> 00:38:19,892
Ki Bong. The tent is ready.

721
00:38:19,912 --> 00:38:21,410
Oh, is it?

722
00:38:21,881 --> 00:38:22,980
Good job.

723
00:38:22,981 --> 00:38:24,033
Don't mention it.

724
00:38:24,781 --> 00:38:26,311
Are you sure you're okay?

725
00:38:26,381 --> 00:38:27,952
Do you want to take a rest inside?

726
00:38:28,022 --> 00:38:30,909
What are you talking about? We're here to make you feel better.

727
00:38:30,921 --> 00:38:32,216
I shouldn't do that.

728
00:38:32,321 --> 00:38:34,463
I'll make you some good kimchi stew.

729
00:38:34,762 --> 00:38:35,782
Just wait.

730
00:38:36,262 --> 00:38:37,690
Where did I put that gas stove?

731
00:38:38,131 --> 00:38:39,223
There it is.

732
00:38:49,671 --> 00:38:50,691
Why?

733
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:51,911
What is it this time?

734
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,747
I thought it was the gas stove,

735
00:38:54,812 --> 00:38:57,127
but it's a tool box.

736
00:38:57,312 --> 00:38:59,524
It looks the same, so I thought it was the gas stove.

737
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:02,550
I'm useless.

738
00:39:02,551 --> 00:39:04,490
Hey, it's all right.

739
00:39:04,691 --> 00:39:08,231
We can cook the stew with a campfire.

740
00:39:08,562 --> 00:39:09,919
Really?

741
00:39:10,062 --> 00:39:11,701
Then I'll prepare the kimchi.

742
00:39:11,702 --> 00:39:12,722
Okay.

743
00:39:19,571 --> 00:39:20,663
What is it?

744
00:39:20,841 --> 00:39:22,678
Why? What's wrong?

745
00:39:24,912 --> 00:39:27,085
It's gochujang.

746
00:39:27,711 --> 00:39:29,792
I thought it was kimchi because it was red.

747
00:39:31,251 --> 00:39:33,181
I don't deserve to live.

748
00:39:33,182 --> 00:39:34,521
It's all right.

749
00:39:34,522 --> 00:39:37,142
Rice with gochujang tastes great in the outdoors.

750
00:39:37,591 --> 00:39:39,223
- Does it? - It's all right.

751
00:39:39,361 --> 00:39:40,993
Then I'll prepare the rice.

752
00:39:41,691 --> 00:39:43,324
Where did I put the rice...

753
00:39:48,401 --> 00:39:50,166
What is it this time?

754
00:39:52,801 --> 00:39:55,423
It's coarse salt!

755
00:39:55,571 --> 00:39:57,376
I thought it was rice because it was white.

756
00:39:58,512 --> 00:40:00,245
That's so like me.

757
00:40:01,381 --> 00:40:03,391
I am so useless.

758
00:40:06,481 --> 00:40:09,583
I wonder how Ki Bong is doing.

759
00:40:10,352 --> 00:40:12,291
I'm not so sure about him.

760
00:40:12,292 --> 00:40:13,312
Right.

761
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,460
Jung Eun, did you memorize the script?

762
00:40:16,461 --> 00:40:17,991
Don't worry. I did.

763
00:40:18,631 --> 00:40:21,732
Are you going to be in the same show as Jun Ki?

764
00:40:21,772 --> 00:40:24,383
Yes. She's Nice Man's assistant, Miss Dumpling.

765
00:40:24,501 --> 00:40:25,541
Miss Dumpling?

766
00:40:25,542 --> 00:40:27,271
I brought her to the director,

767
00:40:27,272 --> 00:40:29,271
and he said she has the perfect face for Miss Dumpling.

768
00:40:29,272 --> 00:40:30,496
She immediately got the job.

769
00:40:30,542 --> 00:40:32,754
She looks just like a dumpling.

770
00:40:32,812 --> 00:40:35,024
Do you have a face of a dumpling?

771
00:40:35,812 --> 00:40:38,473
I told you to stop calling me a dumpling.

772
00:40:41,281 --> 00:40:42,373
That hurt so much.

773
00:40:42,792 --> 00:40:44,424
It hurts!

774
00:40:45,321 --> 00:40:47,791
Are you okay, Jun Ki? Does it hurt?

775
00:40:47,792 --> 00:40:50,485
My back. Check on my back.

776
00:40:50,932 --> 00:40:52,563
Your back? Where?

777
00:40:52,662 --> 00:40:53,682
Here?

778
00:41:01,972 --> 00:41:03,070
You fell for it again.

779
00:41:03,071 --> 00:41:04,876
She always falls for this.

780
00:41:05,812 --> 00:41:08,087
Lee Jun Ki. I'm going to kill you.

781
00:41:11,611 --> 00:41:14,131
Help me! A dumpling is attacking a person!

782
00:41:14,151 --> 00:41:16,232
You bad, violent dumpling!

783
00:41:18,722 --> 00:41:20,323
You deserve it.

784
00:41:20,821 --> 00:41:23,719
How can you pull such a prank on a girl?

785
00:41:23,992 --> 00:41:25,359
Hold on. What?

786
00:41:26,001 --> 00:41:27,154
A "girl"?

787
00:41:27,631 --> 00:41:29,233
Is there any other girl than you here?

788
00:41:29,731 --> 00:41:31,813
What? Are you done?

789
00:41:35,042 --> 00:41:38,031
Gosh, she's angry again.

790
00:41:38,171 --> 00:41:39,845
What's with you?

791
00:41:39,981 --> 00:41:42,980
You can't go a day without getting beaten?

792
00:41:42,981 --> 00:41:46,287
No. Teasing Jung Eun is the most fun thing in the world.

793
00:41:48,892 --> 00:41:50,045
Fine.

794
00:41:50,622 --> 00:41:52,254
I'm not a girl to you?

795
00:41:56,594 --> 00:41:57,716
Jun Ki!

796
00:41:58,834 --> 00:42:00,629
Ta-da. How do I look?

797
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,909
- You're ugly as usual. - Gosh.

798
00:42:06,033 --> 00:42:07,299
That's not what I meant.

799
00:42:07,774 --> 00:42:10,102
I haven't worn a dress in a long time. What do you think?

800
00:42:10,103 --> 00:42:11,500
Oh, a dress?

801
00:42:11,973 --> 00:42:13,749
- You're an ugly person in a dress. - What?

802
00:42:14,814 --> 00:42:16,140
I'm wearing earrings too.

803
00:42:16,214 --> 00:42:17,846
Oh, earrings.

804
00:42:17,944 --> 00:42:19,442
You're an ugly person wearing a dress and earrings.

805
00:42:21,384 --> 00:42:23,158
I put on makeup with extra care too.

806
00:42:24,123 --> 00:42:26,500
You're an ugly person wearing a dress, earrings, and makeup.

807
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,630
What? Are you serious?

808
00:42:30,223 --> 00:42:33,324
No. I should calm down.

809
00:42:34,364 --> 00:42:36,169
Why aren't you hitting me? Let's get it over with.

810
00:42:36,533 --> 00:42:38,032
Why would I hit you?

811
00:42:38,033 --> 00:42:39,502
You were just joking.

812
00:42:41,118 --> 00:42:42,208
No, I wasn't.

813
00:42:42,417 --> 00:42:44,387
I'm more serious than ever.

814
00:42:48,687 --> 00:42:50,625
- Why did you put on a dress anyway? - Just because.

815
00:42:50,727 --> 00:42:53,175
I want to dress well and behave from now on.

816
00:42:57,028 --> 00:42:58,934
- What's that, by the way? - It's for my magic tricks.

817
00:43:01,337 --> 00:43:02,734
Do you want to see a magic trick?

818
00:43:02,868 --> 00:43:05,152
- Really? Sure. - That's a good idea.

819
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:06,476
Let me show you.

820
00:43:06,477 --> 00:43:09,812
I'm going to get this coin into this bottle.

821
00:43:09,977 --> 00:43:11,232
It normally can't, right?

822
00:43:11,348 --> 00:43:12,500
But it will.

823
00:43:13,678 --> 00:43:14,768
Watch this.

824
00:43:17,317 --> 00:43:18,990
Abracadabra!

825
00:43:21,087 --> 00:43:23,097
- It's not working. - Oh, right.

826
00:43:23,388 --> 00:43:25,335
I need some oil from the nose.

827
00:43:26,727 --> 00:43:29,523
Some oil from the nose...

828
00:43:29,868 --> 00:43:32,566
Whatever. Some from the cheeks, the forehead,

829
00:43:32,567 --> 00:43:35,149
and all over the face. I have enough now.

830
00:43:35,408 --> 00:43:36,631
Here we go.

831
00:43:37,707 --> 00:43:40,227
Abracadabra... I give up. I don't feel well.

832
00:43:40,408 --> 00:43:41,530
What's with you?

833
00:43:42,308 --> 00:43:44,317
- I'll go back to reading my script. - Okay. See you.

834
00:43:48,718 --> 00:43:50,046
She fell for it again.

835
00:43:50,047 --> 00:43:51,925
She's such a fool.

836
00:43:53,388 --> 00:43:54,510
What is this?

837
00:43:55,627 --> 00:43:58,035
Jun Ki! How dare you...

838
00:44:02,567 --> 00:44:04,506
You're so mischievous.

839
00:44:05,368 --> 00:44:07,683
I'll go wash my face.

840
00:44:11,808 --> 00:44:13,032
What's with her?

841
00:44:13,977 --> 00:44:15,100
Is she sick?

842
00:44:16,678 --> 00:44:19,094
Hey, Jun Ki.

843
00:44:19,317 --> 00:44:20,500
Hey, what's up?

844
00:44:21,017 --> 00:44:24,893
The thing is, the male guests can't stop looking at my face.

845
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:27,022
They have good taste, I guess.

846
00:44:27,788 --> 00:44:30,440
Oh, really? But it's no surprise.

847
00:44:30,727 --> 00:44:32,697
You sure have an extraordinary face.

848
00:44:33,897 --> 00:44:35,081
Don't flatter me.

849
00:44:36,528 --> 00:44:39,436
Right. When you succeed with that magic trick, you have to show me.

850
00:44:39,437 --> 00:44:40,590
Of course.

851
00:44:41,167 --> 00:44:42,697
I'll go and get ready for the shoot.

852
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:44,460
Thanks again.

853
00:44:44,808 --> 00:44:46,777
What's with him?

854
00:44:47,107 --> 00:44:48,332
Do I look especially good today?

855
00:44:48,877 --> 00:44:51,836
My goodness. It's hard being so pretty.

856
00:44:55,047 --> 00:44:56,241
I'm hungry.

857
00:44:59,917 --> 00:45:03,327
Ki Bong, will you cheer up a bit?

858
00:45:03,328 --> 00:45:04,787
I want to,

859
00:45:05,497 --> 00:45:07,569
but I can't seem to.

860
00:45:07,758 --> 00:45:11,267
You can't? Why don't we just go home then?

861
00:45:12,067 --> 00:45:13,796
What? No way.

862
00:45:13,797 --> 00:45:15,675
We came all the way here to cheer you up.

863
00:45:16,468 --> 00:45:19,467
All right. Let's forget about everything and play a board game.

864
00:45:19,908 --> 00:45:22,050
I even bought a board game for you.

865
00:45:25,477 --> 00:45:26,538
Well...

866
00:45:26,917 --> 00:45:28,447
Apparently, this is the most famous one.

867
00:45:29,118 --> 00:45:31,361
- Do you know what this is? - Of course.

868
00:45:31,647 --> 00:45:32,987
I played it a lot as a kid.

869
00:45:32,988 --> 00:45:34,619
Can you tell me how it works?

870
00:45:35,058 --> 00:45:37,456
- I've never played it. - It's simple.

871
00:45:37,457 --> 00:45:39,641
You roll the dice and move around the board.

872
00:45:39,698 --> 00:45:42,523
You get paid when the other player lands on your property.

873
00:45:42,528 --> 00:45:44,266
You get paid? Why?

874
00:45:44,267 --> 00:45:46,512
It's because the property is yours.

875
00:45:46,638 --> 00:45:47,963
It's like a toll.

876
00:45:48,598 --> 00:45:49,688
A toll?

877
00:45:50,368 --> 00:45:52,436
What are these things?

878
00:45:52,437 --> 00:45:53,737
Oh, they're buildings.

879
00:45:53,738 --> 00:45:57,655
You can build houses, office buildings, and hotels on your land.

880
00:45:57,678 --> 00:45:59,616
- Hotels are the most expensive... - Hold on.

881
00:45:59,948 --> 00:46:01,344
Why are hotels the most expensive?

882
00:46:01,917 --> 00:46:03,825
- Don't office buildings cost more? - What?

883
00:46:04,587 --> 00:46:06,627
That's usually the case in reality,

884
00:46:06,888 --> 00:46:08,928
but these are just the rules of this game.

885
00:46:11,488 --> 00:46:14,252
Why must you stop for three rounds if you land on a desert island?

886
00:46:14,528 --> 00:46:15,626
What's the reason?

887
00:46:15,627 --> 00:46:17,872
There's no reason.

888
00:46:17,897 --> 00:46:19,867
They're just rules.

889
00:46:19,868 --> 00:46:21,066
What if I buy a desert island?

890
00:46:21,067 --> 00:46:24,407
How many times have I told you you can't?

891
00:46:24,408 --> 00:46:25,507
Why not?

892
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:27,548
- It's a piece of land after all. - I don't know.

893
00:46:27,738 --> 00:46:29,007
They're just rules.

894
00:46:29,008 --> 00:46:31,577
They were decided when this game was made.

895
00:46:31,578 --> 00:46:33,688
Gosh, this is frustrating. Forget it.

896
00:46:34,448 --> 00:46:35,887
Why are you so upset?

897
00:46:35,888 --> 00:46:37,550
How can I not be?

898
00:46:37,988 --> 00:46:40,813
I've been explaining the rules to you for an hour now.

899
00:46:40,988 --> 00:46:43,157
You're driving me crazy!

900
00:46:43,158 --> 00:46:45,881
I'm sorry. I'm always like this.

901
00:46:45,957 --> 00:46:47,996
I packed the tool box instead of the gas stove,

902
00:46:47,997 --> 00:46:49,327
and I can't even understand game rules.

903
00:46:49,328 --> 00:46:51,745
No wonder I got fired from my job.

904
00:47:02,808 --> 00:47:04,000
I finally managed to remove everything.

905
00:47:04,377 --> 00:47:07,785
I'll teach Jun Ki a lesson this time.

906
00:47:08,477 --> 00:47:10,221
How dare he draw on my face?

907
00:47:11,247 --> 00:47:13,970
It's so embarrassing. I can't stand it.

908
00:47:14,388 --> 00:47:16,877
- I'm home. - Hi.

909
00:47:16,957 --> 00:47:19,405
- Did you eat? - No. I'm not hungry.

910
00:47:19,558 --> 00:47:20,853
I'll go in and rest.

911
00:47:21,158 --> 00:47:22,861
Just a second, Soo Yeon.

912
00:47:24,028 --> 00:47:26,282
- What is it? - Well...

913
00:47:27,368 --> 00:47:28,765
I heard...

914
00:47:29,408 --> 00:47:31,683
you turned down Woo Shik.

915
00:47:32,107 --> 00:47:33,229
What?

916
00:47:36,278 --> 00:47:37,399
That's right.

917
00:47:38,008 --> 00:47:39,170
Why?

918
00:47:39,517 --> 00:47:41,863
You don't like him?

919
00:47:43,087 --> 00:47:46,382
He might not be very competent, but he's really nice.

920
00:47:47,988 --> 00:47:50,711
I know. He's a really good guy.

921
00:47:51,828 --> 00:47:54,346
But I can't date anyone right now.

922
00:47:55,227 --> 00:47:57,135
I only just started on my job,

923
00:47:57,797 --> 00:47:59,194
and the thing with my dad...

924
00:48:00,468 --> 00:48:01,621
You know, don't you?

925
00:48:03,567 --> 00:48:06,230
Well, you're right.

926
00:48:07,578 --> 00:48:08,802
Okay, Soo Yeon.

927
00:48:08,877 --> 00:48:10,642
Please forget what I just said, okay?

928
00:48:11,547 --> 00:48:14,169
Okay. I'm going in.

929
00:48:17,988 --> 00:48:20,129
I do understand Soo Yeon,

930
00:48:21,388 --> 00:48:23,396
but I still feel sorry for my brother.

931
00:48:24,558 --> 00:48:25,924
What should I do?

932
00:48:36,638 --> 00:48:38,505
Ki Bong, I'm sorry about earlier.

933
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,002
Please cheer up.

934
00:48:40,607 --> 00:48:41,699
No.

935
00:48:43,008 --> 00:48:45,526
I'm so stupid. That's the problem.

936
00:48:50,718 --> 00:48:54,288
I don't think we can have fun today. Why don't we just go home?

937
00:48:54,658 --> 00:48:55,827
What are you talking about?

938
00:48:55,828 --> 00:48:58,205
We came all the way here to cheer you up.

939
00:48:59,457 --> 00:49:00,957
Let's have some beer at least.

940
00:49:01,357 --> 00:49:02,490
Beer?

941
00:49:03,328 --> 00:49:04,418
Here.

942
00:49:04,528 --> 00:49:06,608
All right. Let's drink this, cheer up,

943
00:49:06,638 --> 00:49:09,015
and have some fun, okay? Good.

944
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:11,584
Here we go. Cheers.

945
00:49:11,767 --> 00:49:12,899
Cheers.

946
00:49:39,368 --> 00:49:41,713
It's always more fun when there are many people.

947
00:49:42,538 --> 00:49:45,118
What? Are you saying you want to join those girls?

948
00:49:46,707 --> 00:49:47,830
Forget it.

949
00:49:48,477 --> 00:49:51,027
What kind of girl would want to drink with an unemployed guy?

950
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:54,793
I still want to drink,

951
00:49:55,218 --> 00:49:57,839
but it's not that fun if it's just the two of us.

952
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:04,130
Fine. I'll go talk to them.

953
00:50:04,528 --> 00:50:07,006
Will you please stop sighing?

954
00:50:07,797 --> 00:50:08,827
Gosh.

955
00:50:08,828 --> 00:50:10,868
- Cheers. - Cheers.

956
00:50:13,437 --> 00:50:16,037
We're friends, and this guy got dumped a few days ago.

957
00:50:16,038 --> 00:50:18,566
So I took him out here...

958
00:50:18,567 --> 00:50:19,700
to cheer him up.

959
00:50:20,038 --> 00:50:22,507
I see. You're such a good friend.

960
00:50:22,508 --> 00:50:24,649
Come on, it's nothing.

961
00:50:25,547 --> 00:50:27,862
Any friend would do the same.

962
00:50:28,948 --> 00:50:32,078
But isn't it kind of dull to just drink like this?

963
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:33,641
Do you want to play a game?

964
00:50:33,788 --> 00:50:34,956
How about the "Image Game"?

965
00:50:34,957 --> 00:50:37,157
Sounds good. I know that game too.

966
00:50:37,158 --> 00:50:38,718
Then I'll go first.

967
00:50:38,727 --> 00:50:40,665
All right. Everyone, hold a chopstick.

968
00:50:41,127 --> 00:50:42,932
Woo Shik, here. Hold your chopstick.

969
00:50:42,968 --> 00:50:46,538
Among us, who do you think is the nicest person?

970
00:50:46,698 --> 00:50:48,094
1, 2, 3.

971
00:50:49,167 --> 00:50:50,565
What? Me?

972
00:50:51,308 --> 00:50:52,868
Do I really look that nice?

973
00:50:53,238 --> 00:50:55,859
Well, I really liked your first impression.

974
00:50:56,707 --> 00:50:58,850
Anyway, you've been chosen, so you have to drink.

975
00:50:59,047 --> 00:51:00,099
All right, then.

976
00:51:01,817 --> 00:51:03,756
Woo Shik is quite nice too.

977
00:51:12,428 --> 00:51:13,621
It's my turn.

978
00:51:14,598 --> 00:51:17,467
Among us, who do you think is the funniest person?

979
00:51:17,468 --> 00:51:18,824
1, 2, 3.

980
00:51:21,238 --> 00:51:22,971
What? Me again?

981
00:51:23,508 --> 00:51:24,936
My gosh.

982
00:51:25,038 --> 00:51:27,221
Woo Shik is quite funny too.

983
00:51:27,977 --> 00:51:29,029
I'll drink then.

984
00:51:29,508 --> 00:51:30,875
Since I'm a funny guy.

985
00:51:37,948 --> 00:51:39,080
Is it my turn now?

986
00:51:39,517 --> 00:51:41,017
What should I ask?

987
00:51:42,687 --> 00:51:45,657
Among us, who is your ideal type?

988
00:51:45,658 --> 00:51:47,697
Hey, how could you ask such a question?

989
00:51:47,698 --> 00:51:49,126
Why? It's fun.

990
00:51:49,127 --> 00:51:52,636
All right. 1, 2, 3.

991
00:52:07,917 --> 00:52:09,519
I'm feeling tired, so I'll go and rest.

992
00:52:10,388 --> 00:52:12,968
Ki Bong, what's wrong? Hey, Ki Bong!

993
00:52:15,687 --> 00:52:16,779
What's the matter with him suddenly?

994
00:52:23,828 --> 00:52:24,950
Here we go, Nice Man!

995
00:52:25,127 --> 00:52:26,737
It's Nice Man.

996
00:52:26,738 --> 00:52:28,401
No, no.

997
00:52:28,468 --> 00:52:31,106
Nice kids should not eat junk food.

998
00:52:31,107 --> 00:52:32,706
No, no.

999
00:52:32,707 --> 00:52:33,727
Why not?

1000
00:52:34,738 --> 00:52:37,106
Miss Dumpling will come out...

1001
00:52:37,107 --> 00:52:38,678
and explain that to you in detail.

1002
00:52:38,808 --> 00:52:40,000
Shall we call her out?

1003
00:52:40,417 --> 00:52:42,937
- Miss Dumpling! - Miss Dumpling!

1004
00:52:43,848 --> 00:52:45,214
Here we go, Miss Dumpling!

1005
00:52:45,547 --> 00:52:47,586
Da Young, junk food...

1006
00:52:47,587 --> 00:52:50,686
includes many ingredients that are harmful to our body.

1007
00:52:50,687 --> 00:52:53,057
You may get a stomachache...

1008
00:52:53,058 --> 00:52:55,168
and even suffer from a bad disease.

1009
00:52:55,928 --> 00:52:58,166
So all of you should never...

1010
00:52:58,167 --> 00:53:00,066
eat junk food.

1011
00:53:00,067 --> 00:53:01,836
Okay, Nice Man.

1012
00:53:01,837 --> 00:53:04,387
We'll see you next time!

1013
00:53:05,408 --> 00:53:07,448
- Here we go, Nice Man! - Here we go, Miss Dumpling!

1014
00:53:08,837 --> 00:53:10,146
Cut. Good job.

1015
00:53:10,147 --> 00:53:11,146
Great job, everyone.

1016
00:53:11,147 --> 00:53:14,034
- Thank you, everyone. - Thank you.

1017
00:53:14,877 --> 00:53:17,117
Jun Ki, how was I today? Did I do well?

1018
00:53:17,118 --> 00:53:18,750
You did great.

1019
00:53:19,218 --> 00:53:22,594
You look so cute wearing a costume like this.

1020
00:53:23,058 --> 00:53:24,760
What are you talking about?

1021
00:53:24,828 --> 00:53:26,735
You just look so adorable.

1022
00:53:27,058 --> 00:53:28,119
Come here.

1023
00:53:28,328 --> 00:53:30,133
Gosh, you're so cute.

1024
00:53:31,028 --> 00:53:33,210
You're so cute.

1025
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:36,307
You're so cute. You're so cute...

1026
00:53:36,308 --> 00:53:37,430
So cute!

1027
00:53:39,138 --> 00:53:40,976
What on earth? Hey, Jun Ki.

1028
00:53:40,977 --> 00:53:43,447
I can't see. I can't see a thing.

1029
00:53:43,448 --> 00:53:45,007
I got you again.

1030
00:53:45,008 --> 00:53:46,777
- You're so stupid. - I can't see.

1031
00:53:46,778 --> 00:53:48,348
- Hey. - I got you again.

1032
00:53:49,687 --> 00:53:51,584
Jung Eun. Hey.

1033
00:53:52,017 --> 00:53:53,894
Jung Eun, I'm sorry.

1034
00:53:54,058 --> 00:53:56,987
Jung Eun. I know I was a bit harsh.

1035
00:53:56,988 --> 00:53:58,211
Forget it.

1036
00:54:00,558 --> 00:54:02,639
Jung Eun, are you okay?

1037
00:54:03,468 --> 00:54:05,099
Did you twist your ankle?

1038
00:54:07,067 --> 00:54:09,658
Gosh, you even hurt your heel.

1039
00:54:10,707 --> 00:54:12,807
What did you put on heels for all of a sudden?

1040
00:54:12,808 --> 00:54:14,440
I just wanted to wear them. Why?

1041
00:54:14,508 --> 00:54:16,038
Can I not even wear heels?

1042
00:54:16,477 --> 00:54:17,905
Why are you getting angry?

1043
00:54:19,008 --> 00:54:21,292
Get up. Can you get up?

1044
00:54:25,848 --> 00:54:27,112
There's no other way.

1045
00:54:27,888 --> 00:54:29,969
Come on. I'll carry you on my back.

1046
00:54:31,127 --> 00:54:32,932
What? Forget it.

1047
00:54:33,497 --> 00:54:35,333
How will you walk like that?

1048
00:54:35,428 --> 00:54:36,550
Come on, get on my back.

1049
00:54:39,538 --> 00:54:41,098
Come on!

1050
00:54:41,198 --> 00:54:42,840
I'm telling you, I'm okay.

1051
00:54:44,868 --> 00:54:45,999
You're so heavy.

1052
00:54:46,138 --> 00:54:47,331
Is this gravity pulling me or what?

1053
00:54:48,107 --> 00:54:50,290
Gosh, you're heavy as a rock.

1054
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:52,312
How much do you weigh?

1055
00:54:52,348 --> 00:54:55,277
Don't you know it's rude to ask a girl that?

1056
00:54:55,278 --> 00:54:56,645
Let me tell you one more time.

1057
00:54:57,017 --> 00:54:58,816
Where is the girl right now?

1058
00:54:58,817 --> 00:55:00,185
I'm a girl too.

1059
00:55:00,517 --> 00:55:02,086
You really don't see me as a girl?

1060
00:55:02,087 --> 00:55:03,107
No.

1061
00:55:03,457 --> 00:55:06,048
Fine then. Let me ask you something.

1062
00:55:06,058 --> 00:55:08,475
If you and I are stranded on a desert island,

1063
00:55:08,658 --> 00:55:10,973
and we're the only ones left, what will you do?

1064
00:55:11,227 --> 00:55:12,288
What?

1065
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,368
How could you imagine something like that?

1066
00:55:17,138 --> 00:55:20,575
I'll find myself a pretty sea turtle...

1067
00:55:20,937 --> 00:55:24,375
and have a boy turtle and girl turtle...

1068
00:55:24,747 --> 00:55:26,277
and live happily ever after.

1069
00:55:27,718 --> 00:55:28,768
What?

1070
00:55:29,917 --> 00:55:31,887
Then what if all the sea turtles go extinct?

1071
00:55:32,047 --> 00:55:34,608
You and I are the only ones left. What will you do then?

1072
00:55:35,817 --> 00:55:36,878
What is that?

1073
00:55:39,028 --> 00:55:41,781
Then that desert island will become deserted again.

1074
00:55:42,598 --> 00:55:43,618
What?

1075
00:55:43,868 --> 00:55:46,697
Does that mean you're more attracted to a sea turtle than me?

1076
00:55:46,698 --> 00:55:48,636
You don't see me as a guy either.

1077
00:55:48,868 --> 00:55:50,936
You and I are just friends.

1078
00:55:50,937 --> 00:55:52,713
Just friends, just like Woo Shik and Ki Bong.

1079
00:55:54,078 --> 00:55:55,302
Why are you suddenly asking that?

1080
00:55:55,837 --> 00:55:57,234
I just asked. Why?

1081
00:55:57,877 --> 00:55:58,929
Jung Eun.

1082
00:55:59,278 --> 00:56:00,339
What is it this time?

1083
00:56:00,718 --> 00:56:04,828
I'm really happy that you're my friend.

1084
00:56:05,888 --> 00:56:09,050
We can joke around and practice acting together.

1085
00:56:09,428 --> 00:56:10,610
We can rely on each other in tough situations.

1086
00:56:11,727 --> 00:56:12,818
So...

1087
00:56:13,227 --> 00:56:15,574
don't get upset if I joke around and tease you.

1088
00:56:16,297 --> 00:56:17,654
Just stay by my side...

1089
00:56:18,297 --> 00:56:19,389
until we die.

1090
00:56:20,297 --> 00:56:21,317
Okay, my friend?

1091
00:56:22,808 --> 00:56:25,826
Okay. Since we're friends.

1092
00:56:26,808 --> 00:56:27,898
Friends.

1093
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:31,831
Let's go eat some ramyeon.

1094
00:56:44,428 --> 00:56:45,753
Can you please stop?

1095
00:56:46,058 --> 00:56:47,856
What's wrong with you? It's not even a big deal.

1096
00:56:47,857 --> 00:56:50,723
I'm sorry for making you uncomfortable over nothing.

1097
00:56:51,028 --> 00:56:54,056
Well, I brought the tool box instead of the gas stove,

1098
00:56:54,098 --> 00:56:55,698
and didn't even understand the game rules.

1099
00:56:56,508 --> 00:56:59,159
I'm just a loser who isn't popular with the ladies either.

1100
00:56:59,607 --> 00:57:01,407
No wonder I was fired from work.

1101
00:57:01,408 --> 00:57:03,621
Hey, you can just find another job.

1102
00:57:04,408 --> 00:57:06,315
That's not as easy as it sounds.

1103
00:57:06,477 --> 00:57:09,068
Well, how would you know how I feel?

1104
00:57:09,888 --> 00:57:13,016
I wouldn't be like this if I was merely dumped by a girl like you.

1105
00:57:13,017 --> 00:57:15,557
- What? - You were just dumped by a girl.

1106
00:57:15,558 --> 00:57:17,856
You made everyone worry and made me come here with you.

1107
00:57:17,857 --> 00:57:21,019
What? You're the one who practically dragged me here.

1108
00:57:21,127 --> 00:57:23,474
Oh, so this is my fault?

1109
00:57:23,698 --> 00:57:25,871
Now you're showing your true color.

1110
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:28,737
I'm sorry for dragging you to the camping site.

1111
00:57:28,738 --> 00:57:30,766
All I wanted to do was cheer you up.

1112
00:57:30,767 --> 00:57:32,470
How could you repay my kindness like this, you jerk?

1113
00:57:32,977 --> 00:57:34,437
That's why Soo Yeon dumped you.

1114
00:57:35,238 --> 00:57:37,146
What did you say? Say that again.

1115
00:57:37,147 --> 00:57:40,615
I won't. I have so much I want to say, but I'll just hold it in.

1116
00:57:41,377 --> 00:57:43,686
Forget it. You're so narrow-minded.

1117
00:57:43,687 --> 00:57:44,942
That's why you were fired from work.

1118
00:57:46,017 --> 00:57:48,506
What? You jerk...

1119
00:57:51,857 --> 00:57:52,996
Did you just hit me?

1120
00:57:52,997 --> 00:57:55,140
Yes, I did. You got a problem with that?

1121
00:57:55,227 --> 00:57:56,522
You little punk.

1122
00:57:56,997 --> 00:57:58,150
You little...

1123
00:58:01,038 --> 00:58:02,292
My nose...

1124
00:58:02,868 --> 00:58:03,929
My nose is bleeding!

1125
00:58:04,607 --> 00:58:05,862
You're dead meat.

1126
00:58:05,937 --> 00:58:07,570
- Come here. Get over here. - Hey.

1127
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,099
Come here!

1128
00:58:14,078 --> 00:58:15,139
Come here.

1129
00:58:20,158 --> 00:58:21,280
You punk.

1130
00:58:23,428 --> 00:58:24,958
How dare you...

1131
00:58:25,058 --> 00:58:26,126
hit my face?

1132
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:28,097
Hey, come here.

1133
00:58:28,098 --> 00:58:29,179
Hey!

1134
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,229
Hey, time out.

1135
00:58:35,619 --> 00:58:36,709
Let's take a break.

1136
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:38,979
Okay.

1137
00:58:39,258 --> 00:58:40,890
You're dead after we take a short break.

1138
00:58:41,329 --> 00:58:42,481
That's what I wanted to say.

1139
00:58:42,699 --> 00:58:45,382
If I tried harder, you won't even be alive. Do you know that?

1140
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:47,167
I didn't even use half of my strength.

1141
00:58:47,168 --> 00:58:49,178
I didn't even use one fourth of my strength.

1142
00:58:52,809 --> 00:58:54,308
What? Why are you laughing?

1143
00:58:54,309 --> 00:58:55,839
It's just funny.

1144
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:57,986
What are we doing here?

1145
00:58:59,648 --> 00:59:00,700
I know.

1146
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:05,249
Still, I feel much better after we threw some punches...

1147
00:59:05,619 --> 00:59:07,149
at each other like this.

1148
00:59:07,789 --> 00:59:09,389
It feels kind of satisfying too.

1149
00:59:09,851 --> 00:59:10,618
Really?

1150
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:12,257
Do you feel better now?

1151
00:59:12,258 --> 00:59:14,063
What's there to feel better about?

1152
00:59:14,228 --> 00:59:17,288
Still, since I told her how I feel,

1153
00:59:18,128 --> 00:59:19,394
I don't have regrets.

1154
00:59:19,668 --> 00:59:20,720
Good.

1155
00:59:21,539 --> 00:59:23,099
Forget about her.

1156
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,340
Trust me.

1157
00:59:25,608 --> 00:59:29,108
You'll find a girl much prettier and nicer than Soo Yeon.

1158
00:59:30,909 --> 00:59:32,030
Thanks.

1159
00:59:32,278 --> 00:59:35,889
You'll find a company much better than that one.

1160
00:59:36,179 --> 00:59:37,270
Do you really think so?

1161
00:59:46,088 --> 00:59:47,995
If not, whatever.

1162
00:59:48,458 --> 00:59:51,732
Sure. My day will come.

1163
00:59:54,838 --> 00:59:56,643
The sky is so pretty.

1164
00:59:58,438 --> 00:59:59,561
It is.

1165
01:00:11,349 --> 01:00:12,888
I told you, I'm sorry.

1166
01:00:12,889 --> 01:00:15,509
How dare you smear my face...

1167
01:00:15,659 --> 01:00:16,928
and expect to live?

1168
01:00:16,929 --> 01:00:18,662
Why are you so cold-hearted?

1169
01:00:18,889 --> 01:00:21,305
- Can't you just laugh it off? - Be quiet!

1170
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:22,551
Keep your hands up.

1171
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:27,302
Nice job.

1172
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:29,636
Don't rub it in.

1173
01:00:30,068 --> 01:00:32,180
Just look at yourself.

1174
01:00:32,309 --> 01:00:34,207
You said you were going to dress up from now on.

1175
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:37,004
I was going to, but it just wasn't me.

1176
01:00:37,349 --> 01:00:39,348
Hey, keep your hands up!

1177
01:00:40,019 --> 01:00:41,917
Are you really going to do this to me? I'm your friend.

1178
01:00:41,918 --> 01:00:43,213
That's why I'm doing this to you.

1179
01:00:43,548 --> 01:00:44,711
Keep your arms on your ears!

1180
01:00:46,458 --> 01:00:47,595
We're back.

1181
01:00:47,595 --> 01:00:49,472
Did you have fun?

1182
01:00:49,789 --> 01:00:51,658
What's wrong with your face?

1183
01:00:51,659 --> 01:00:52,812
Something came up.

1184
01:00:53,028 --> 01:00:55,068
Are you feeling better?

1185
01:00:55,128 --> 01:00:57,270
I feel much better, thanks to Ki Bong.

1186
01:00:57,398 --> 01:00:58,968
I forgot, I have to go.

1187
01:00:58,969 --> 01:01:00,738
Go where?

1188
01:01:00,739 --> 01:01:03,053
I got a call from the live cafe to fill in.

1189
01:01:03,239 --> 01:01:05,412
Every penny counts.

1190
01:01:05,438 --> 01:01:06,529
I'll go get ready.

1191
01:01:07,008 --> 01:01:09,385
I guess he feels much better.

1192
01:01:09,849 --> 01:01:12,602
- What happened? - I have my ways.

1193
01:01:13,478 --> 01:01:15,621
I told you to count on me.

1194
01:01:16,219 --> 01:01:17,922
You're brilliant.

1195
01:01:18,219 --> 01:01:21,518
I'll show you a magic trick as a reward.

1196
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:22,946
A magic trick? Sure.

1197
01:01:23,088 --> 01:01:24,210
What is it?

1198
01:01:41,938 --> 01:01:43,070
What are you doing here?

1199
01:01:44,679 --> 01:01:47,348
Woo Shik. When did you get here?

1200
01:01:47,349 --> 01:01:49,118
Just now. Why are you doing it alone?

1201
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:50,147
You should've called for help.

1202
01:01:50,148 --> 01:01:52,596
- Move over. I'll help you. - It's okay. I got it.

1203
01:01:52,619 --> 01:01:55,239
Friends should help each other out.

1204
01:01:55,389 --> 01:01:57,092
- Isn't that right, friend? - What?

1205
01:01:57,528 --> 01:01:58,650
Let me see.

1206
01:01:59,458 --> 01:02:00,683
Should I take it up to the rooftop?

1207
01:02:01,258 --> 01:02:03,136
I'll get going.

1208
01:02:10,208 --> 01:02:11,595
I'm starving.

1209
01:02:12,668 --> 01:02:16,003
I didn't have anything to eat since yesterday because of Ki Bong.

1210
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:21,872
Maybe I should have a hotteok.

1211
01:02:25,318 --> 01:02:27,118
- Hello. - Welcome!

1212
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:28,751
- One hotteok, please. - Sure.

1213
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:34,496
- Here you go. - Thank you.

1214
01:02:35,858 --> 01:02:38,419
Why are you alone today?

1215
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:41,098
What about the pretty girl you always come with?

1216
01:02:41,099 --> 01:02:43,038
What? Just because.

1217
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:45,308
Why? Did you fight with your girlfriend?

1218
01:02:45,309 --> 01:02:47,216
She's not my girlfriend.

1219
01:02:48,008 --> 01:02:49,437
She's just a friend.

1220
01:02:50,108 --> 01:02:51,272
A good friend.

1221
01:03:34,258 --> 01:03:37,988
I don't think I should be seeing anyone at the moment.

1222
01:03:37,989 --> 01:03:40,376
We're still good friends, right?

1223
01:03:43,168 --> 01:03:44,903
You two looked so good together.

1224
01:03:45,068 --> 01:03:46,873
Why don't you ask her out?

1225
01:03:53,639 --> 01:03:56,331
What's wrong? Are you all right?

1226
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:01,799
No.

1227
01:04:03,619 --> 01:04:05,251
I thought I was okay,

1228
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:08,847
but I guess I'm not.

1229
01:04:45,059 --> 01:04:47,609
(Welcome to Waikiki 2 / Eulachacha Waikiki 2)

1230
01:04:48,099 --> 01:04:49,558
I'm going to start working on my song again.

1231
01:04:49,559 --> 01:04:51,198
I should write a good song and make a comeback.

1232
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:52,727
Are you sure he's heartbroken?

1233
01:04:52,728 --> 01:04:54,738
He's been pretending to be fine, but it was all a lie!

1234
01:04:54,739 --> 01:04:55,968
These words are all for Soo Yeon.

1235
01:04:55,969 --> 01:04:58,997
He liked Soo Yeon since high school.

1236
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:00,078
You're Jun Ki, aren't you?

1237
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:01,377
- It's me! - Who is he?

1238
01:05:01,378 --> 01:05:03,547
I would've helped you out if I knew you were an actor.

1239
01:05:03,548 --> 01:05:04,748
This is driving me crazy!

1240
01:05:04,749 --> 01:05:08,186
I need to figure out his name in order to get help from him.

1241
01:05:08,318 --> 01:05:12,118
It's my first time with food trucks. Do you have any tips?

1242
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:13,218
It needs to taste good.

1243
01:05:13,219 --> 01:05:14,412
You have to win them over with the taste.

1244
01:05:15,258 --> 01:05:16,757
I can't just stand here and watch.

1245
01:05:16,758 --> 01:05:18,727
We need to come up with shocking performance.

1246
01:05:18,728 --> 01:05:21,498
I've only been receiving things from Woo Shik.

1247
01:05:21,499 --> 01:05:23,468
What can I do for him?

1248
01:05:24,469 --> 01:05:25,651
- Woo Shik... - Teacher!
