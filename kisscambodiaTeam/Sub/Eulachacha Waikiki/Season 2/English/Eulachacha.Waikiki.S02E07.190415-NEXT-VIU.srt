00:00:10,983 --> 00:00:12,238
(Filming in Progress, "Jo Dal Ho")

2
00:00:16,753 --> 00:00:18,992
What's wrong, Director? Is there a problem?

3
00:00:18,993 --> 00:00:22,622
It's just that you're dressed too neatly for beggars.

4
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:23,785
What?

5
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:27,002
But I tried dressing as poorly as I could.

6
00:00:27,003 --> 00:00:28,900
But something still doesn't seem right.

7
00:00:29,633 --> 00:00:31,540
Right, where's Beggar number three?

8
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,142
- Beggar number three? - I'm here.

9
00:00:57,162 --> 00:00:58,458
I'm sorry I'm late.

10
00:00:58,533 --> 00:01:00,402
It took some time finishing my makeup.

11
00:01:00,403 --> 00:01:01,627
You did your makeup on your own?

12
00:01:01,702 --> 00:01:02,722
Yes.

13
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:04,372
Does it look weird?

14
00:01:04,373 --> 00:01:05,657
No, not at all.

15
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,710
You look like a real beggar.

16
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:09,365
What's that baby carriage?

17
00:01:09,442 --> 00:01:12,612
Oh, I noticed beggars push around baby carriages often.

18
00:01:12,613 --> 00:01:14,842
They put wastepaper or scraps inside them.

19
00:01:14,843 --> 00:01:16,551
I found out while doing some research.

20
00:01:16,552 --> 00:01:17,881
You even did research?

21
00:01:17,882 --> 00:01:20,127
Gosh, she really is impressive.

22
00:01:22,022 --> 00:01:25,623
What's wrong with you two? Shouldn't actors try this hard at least?

23
00:01:26,322 --> 00:01:27,821
- I'm sorry, sir. - Forget it.

24
00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:30,201
Wow, I really like her.

25
00:01:30,692 --> 00:01:32,161
You're like a real beggar.

26
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,130
How could you look so shabby?

27
00:01:34,432 --> 00:01:36,431
You're a true beggar indeed.

28
00:01:36,432 --> 00:01:37,771
Gosh, I love it.

29
00:01:37,772 --> 00:01:41,578
(Our Twisted Hero)

30
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:52,531
This was Singer Cha Woo Shik.

31
00:01:59,522 --> 00:02:00,645
Woo Shik, drink this.

32
00:02:01,423 --> 00:02:02,790
I really enjoyed your song.

33
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:03,853
Thanks.

34
00:02:03,932 --> 00:02:06,136
- Do you like your work? - Yes, it's fun.

35
00:02:06,462 --> 00:02:08,102
Thank you for introducing me to this job.

36
00:02:08,103 --> 00:02:10,271
No problem. It's nothing to be thankful about.

37
00:02:10,272 --> 00:02:12,702
Soo Yeon, I'm sorry, but can you go and clean up that table?

38
00:02:12,703 --> 00:02:13,997
Yes, sir.

39
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,012
She replies so confidently.

40
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:19,868
I know. Soo Yeon always replies with confidence,

41
00:02:19,913 --> 00:02:21,512
and she's so diligent,

42
00:02:21,513 --> 00:02:23,593
thorough, and a perfectionist...

43
00:02:28,622 --> 00:02:29,775
You said she's a perfectionist.

44
00:02:29,893 --> 00:02:32,882
I meant she pursues to become a perfectionist.

45
00:02:36,693 --> 00:02:38,599
The weather feels so warm now.

46
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,443
So it's spring now, isn't it?

47
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:43,893
It is.

48
00:02:46,073 --> 00:02:47,429
Why do you sound so discouraged?

49
00:02:47,943 --> 00:02:50,319
Why? Because you broke those cups earlier?

50
00:02:50,573 --> 00:02:54,112
Besides that, I kept making mistakes all day long.

51
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:58,611
Woo Shik, what is the matter with me?

52
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:01,626
I really wanted to do a good job this time.

53
00:03:01,722 --> 00:03:03,936
It's okay. You can do better from tomorrow.

54
00:03:04,522 --> 00:03:05,716
Don't worry about it.

55
00:03:07,492 --> 00:03:08,952
Okay, then.

56
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,900
Hey, cheer up.

57
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,603
Hey, it's hotteok. Soo Yeon, do you want some?

58
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:15,857
What? Hotteok?

59
00:03:16,272 --> 00:03:18,414
I love hotteok. Let's go, Woo Shik.

60
00:03:21,143 --> 00:03:22,871
- Hello. - Welcome.

61
00:03:22,872 --> 00:03:24,371
Ma'am, we'll have two.

62
00:03:24,513 --> 00:03:26,725
Woo Shik, let's buy three. I want two.

63
00:03:26,812 --> 00:03:29,567
Oh, my. Your girlfriend must really like hotteok.

64
00:03:29,652 --> 00:03:30,805
Girlfriend?

65
00:03:31,353 --> 00:03:33,521
Oh, we're not going out.

66
00:03:33,522 --> 00:03:36,521
Really? You looked great together so I thought you were a couple.

67
00:03:36,522 --> 00:03:37,542
A couple?

68
00:03:38,693 --> 00:03:40,325
Ma'am, you're so silly.

69
00:03:40,923 --> 00:03:43,381
How could you be so mistaken like that?

70
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,513
I've changed my mind. Give me all the hotteok you have here.

71
00:04:00,483 --> 00:04:03,412
Hey. How long have you been staring at photos of beggars?

72
00:04:03,413 --> 00:04:05,350
I'm researching.

73
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:07,522
I have to concentrate so don't disturb me.

74
00:04:08,522 --> 00:04:10,091
Hey, everybody!

75
00:04:10,092 --> 00:04:11,591
- What's up? - Hey.

76
00:04:11,592 --> 00:04:12,919
- Do you want some hotteok? - What?

77
00:04:12,992 --> 00:04:14,012
What's all that hotteok for?

78
00:04:14,522 --> 00:04:15,992
What on earth? Is this full of hotteok?

79
00:04:15,993 --> 00:04:19,021
Yes. The owner of the hotteok place was so kind.

80
00:04:19,032 --> 00:04:20,736
I felt grateful and bought everything.

81
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,632
Why are you so excited? Did something good happen?

82
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:27,050
It was his first day going to work with Soo Yeon.

83
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:30,368
No wonder you're so excited.

84
00:04:30,612 --> 00:04:31,942
Do you like Soo Yeon that much?

85
00:04:31,943 --> 00:04:33,003
Of course, I do.

86
00:04:33,782 --> 00:04:34,981
But how do you know that?

87
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:36,312
Jun Ki told me all about it.

88
00:04:36,313 --> 00:04:38,582
What? Hey, I told you to keep it a secret.

89
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,969
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.

90
00:04:41,422 --> 00:04:44,177
Anyway, do you feel really happy to hang out with Soo Yeon...

91
00:04:44,193 --> 00:04:45,824
- all day long? - Yes, I'm happy.

92
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,421
We go to work together and come home together.

93
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:49,562
We ate hotteok together.

94
00:04:49,563 --> 00:04:51,892
Oh, right. The lady selling hotteoks told us...

95
00:04:51,893 --> 00:04:53,739
that we looked like a couple.

96
00:04:55,102 --> 00:04:58,091
I was so embarrassed, and I blushed like crazy.

97
00:04:59,772 --> 00:05:00,925
Director!

98
00:05:03,272 --> 00:05:05,180
Director, good morning.

99
00:05:05,412 --> 00:05:06,432
You're here early.

100
00:05:06,712 --> 00:05:08,781
- What's wrong with you today? - After what you said yesterday,

101
00:05:08,782 --> 00:05:11,058
I put extra care into my outfit and makeup.

102
00:05:11,212 --> 00:05:13,552
- What do you think? - You look much better.

103
00:05:13,553 --> 00:05:15,868
See, you look more like a real beggar now.

104
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,013
Thank you, sir.

105
00:05:17,222 --> 00:05:20,562
The beggar of beggars. Where is the queen of beggars, Jung Eun?

106
00:05:20,563 --> 00:05:21,644
I'm right here.

107
00:05:22,662 --> 00:05:23,682
What is that beggar?

108
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,094
Hello, sir.

109
00:05:37,172 --> 00:05:41,293
My goodness. It's impossible not to be fond of you.

110
00:05:41,412 --> 00:05:43,252
Wait a minute. Producer,

111
00:05:43,253 --> 00:05:44,851
do we have any lines we can give Jung Eun?

112
00:05:44,852 --> 00:05:48,117
Well, the only lines that the beggars have today...

113
00:05:48,123 --> 00:05:49,382
belong to Jun Ki.

114
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:51,463
- Yes. - Give those lines to Jun Eun then.

115
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:52,745
What? Pardon?

116
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,921
There's no need for that, Director.

117
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:57,361
It's all right. I want to repay you with something.

118
00:05:57,362 --> 00:05:58,414
Just do as I say.

119
00:05:58,462 --> 00:06:00,861
Jung Eun, why don't we go get a cup of coffee?

120
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:02,401
- Let's take a five-minute break. - Okay.

121
00:06:02,402 --> 00:06:03,525
Let's take five, everyone!

122
00:06:03,772 --> 00:06:05,057
I'm sorry, Jun Ki.

123
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:07,434
No, don't worry about it.

124
00:06:08,073 --> 00:06:10,052
Don't mind me. Go enjoy your coffee

125
00:06:10,112 --> 00:06:11,571
Then I'll see you later.

126
00:06:15,313 --> 00:06:18,618
So he thinks Jung Eun looks more homeless than I do.

127
00:06:18,652 --> 00:06:19,733
Fine.

128
00:06:20,782 --> 00:06:23,709
I shall show him what a real beggar looks like.

129
00:06:25,193 --> 00:06:27,822
I'll show him what people can look like...

130
00:06:27,823 --> 00:06:29,627
when they actually live on the streets.

131
00:06:40,643 --> 00:06:42,509
Soo Yeon, what are you doing?

132
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:43,837
Oh, well...

133
00:06:44,813 --> 00:06:48,142
I put food scraps down the drain, and it got all clogged.

134
00:06:48,143 --> 00:06:49,265
I see.

135
00:06:50,253 --> 00:06:51,538
You should've been careful.

136
00:06:53,323 --> 00:06:54,444
Hey, Woo Shik.

137
00:06:56,222 --> 00:06:57,375
We need to talk.

138
00:06:59,893 --> 00:07:01,187
Hey, I think I'll have to...

139
00:07:03,162 --> 00:07:04,968
- let Soo Yeon go. - What?

140
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:07,389
What do you mean you'll let her go?

141
00:07:07,532 --> 00:07:09,439
- Are you saying you'll fire her? - That's right.

142
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:11,031
It's only been 2 days,

143
00:07:11,032 --> 00:07:13,388
but she's already broken 7 beer glasses and 5 plates.

144
00:07:13,772 --> 00:07:15,971
Today, she got the drain clogged. Don't you see how it's flooded?

145
00:07:15,972 --> 00:07:17,544
Still, that's too harsh.

146
00:07:18,112 --> 00:07:21,510
She'll feel so dejected if she gets fired again.

147
00:07:21,712 --> 00:07:23,752
- Let it slide just once. Please? - I don't care.

148
00:07:26,782 --> 00:07:28,965
Hello? Yes, sir.

149
00:07:29,823 --> 00:07:31,659
What? Pardon?

150
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:33,543
Okay.

151
00:07:35,092 --> 00:07:36,999
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

152
00:07:37,263 --> 00:07:38,392
Why? What was it about?

153
00:07:38,393 --> 00:07:40,239
We've been protesting because of our rent.

154
00:07:40,532 --> 00:07:41,861
But other business owners will do...

155
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:44,556
the 3-steps-and-1-bow thing to the building owner's place.

156
00:07:45,772 --> 00:07:47,435
I have bad knees. I'm so worried.

157
00:07:47,503 --> 00:07:48,563
Really?

158
00:07:49,672 --> 00:07:52,060
Hey, how about we do this?

159
00:07:53,443 --> 00:07:56,615
Go away, evil, greedy landlord!

160
00:07:56,883 --> 00:07:59,312
- Go away! - Go away!

161
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:01,189
(We're against unreasonable rent increase!)

162
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,996
(We will fight no matter what.)

163
00:08:05,422 --> 00:08:07,534
Gosh, this is killing me.

164
00:08:08,162 --> 00:08:10,101
How long will it take to get there?

165
00:08:11,693 --> 00:08:12,917
I have no choice though.

166
00:08:13,263 --> 00:08:16,700
He promised he wouldn't fire Soo Yeon if I did this,

167
00:08:16,972 --> 00:08:18,462
so I must get to the finishing line.

168
00:08:19,172 --> 00:08:20,397
Yes, let's go!

169
00:08:20,902 --> 00:08:24,718
3-steps-and-1-bow, all the way to the landlord's house!

170
00:08:24,842 --> 00:08:27,942
Go away, evil, greedy landlord!

171
00:08:27,943 --> 00:08:30,564
- Go away! - Go away!

172
00:08:34,423 --> 00:08:37,686
Goodness, it looks like they're protesting because of their rent.

173
00:08:38,653 --> 00:08:41,447
How do they expect small business owners to make ends meet?

174
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,365
Look at that punk.

175
00:09:07,482 --> 00:09:08,574
Darn it.

176
00:09:13,193 --> 00:09:15,202
What? Where did he go?

177
00:09:17,563 --> 00:09:19,662
Who are you? Why are you following me?

178
00:09:19,663 --> 00:09:22,621
- Who sent you? - Well, don't get the wrong idea.

179
00:09:22,803 --> 00:09:26,035
Did you follow me to steal my baby carriage?

180
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:27,772
You cannot take it, you punk.

181
00:09:27,773 --> 00:09:30,057
- It's all I have! - Sir, let me explain.

182
00:09:30,242 --> 00:09:31,804
It's not that.

183
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:34,432
What? So you're an actor,

184
00:09:34,482 --> 00:09:36,277
and you're playing a beggar?

185
00:09:36,413 --> 00:09:38,728
Yes, that's why I want to see how beggars live...

186
00:09:39,183 --> 00:09:42,282
I mean, I'd like to experience how those living on the streets...

187
00:09:42,283 --> 00:09:43,578
actually live.

188
00:09:43,653 --> 00:09:46,052
It'll help me portray my character in a more realistic manner.

189
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,292
But why me?

190
00:09:47,293 --> 00:09:50,088
I've visited Seoul Station, Yongsan Station, and Yeongdeungpo Station,

191
00:09:50,492 --> 00:09:52,839
and you looked most pathetic out of all the beggars I've seen.

192
00:09:52,862 --> 00:09:54,032
You little punk.

193
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:57,601
Sir, I'm just saying that you're very professional.

194
00:09:57,602 --> 00:09:59,235
That's all.

195
00:10:03,673 --> 00:10:05,681
Right, I always...

196
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,598
do my best whenever I do anything.

197
00:10:11,852 --> 00:10:14,535
Sir, please teach me.

198
00:10:14,953 --> 00:10:16,247
I beg you.

199
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:22,631
I understand where you're coming from,

200
00:10:22,762 --> 00:10:24,425
but I'm busy trying to survive.

201
00:10:24,632 --> 00:10:25,785
Go find someone else.

202
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:27,653
What?

203
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,413
Sir!

204
00:10:31,132 --> 00:10:32,602
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

205
00:10:32,773 --> 00:10:33,926
My legs hurt so much.

206
00:10:34,673 --> 00:10:35,998
Oh, boy.

207
00:10:36,742 --> 00:10:39,425
Gosh, my entire body aches.

208
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,851
We went all the way to his place like that.

209
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,152
How could he not even open the door?

210
00:10:45,153 --> 00:10:47,570
We should do something more intense.

211
00:10:47,722 --> 00:10:49,182
Do you have any good ideas?

212
00:10:49,252 --> 00:10:51,701
How about we write to him in blood?

213
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:53,046
- In blood? - Yes.

214
00:10:53,923 --> 00:10:55,013
Writing in blood...

215
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:57,991
Oh, that's a great idea.

216
00:10:57,992 --> 00:10:59,261
We'll write in blood?

217
00:10:59,262 --> 00:11:00,966
Do you think that will be enough?

218
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:03,481
Shouldn't we at least go on a hunger strike?

219
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:05,523
That's another good idea.

220
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:08,427
Then let's do both. We'll do both of them.

221
00:11:08,472 --> 00:11:09,697
What? Both of them?

222
00:11:10,273 --> 00:11:12,241
- Gosh, this is crazy. - Sounds good.

223
00:11:12,242 --> 00:11:13,334
Let's do it!

224
00:11:17,112 --> 00:11:18,234
Hey. It's me, Woo Shik.

225
00:11:19,752 --> 00:11:21,314
I finished the walk,

226
00:11:21,783 --> 00:11:23,761
but they want to write to him in blood now.

227
00:11:23,823 --> 00:11:26,221
They'll also go on a hunger strike. What should I do?

228
00:11:26,222 --> 00:11:27,549
I'll have to do it if they're all doing it.

229
00:11:27,823 --> 00:11:29,353
- You do it. - What? Me?

230
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,998
Hey, it's not fair that you're making me do even that.

231
00:11:35,732 --> 00:11:38,527
Soo Yeon, did you break another plate?

232
00:11:38,703 --> 00:11:40,032
I'm sorry, sir.

233
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,204
- Gosh, you're driving me crazy. - I'm sorry.

234
00:11:43,673 --> 00:11:45,508
Hey, so what are you saying? You can't do it?

235
00:11:46,512 --> 00:11:49,981
No, it's not that. I should do it for you, of course.

236
00:11:51,012 --> 00:11:54,726
So go easy on Soo Yeon even if she makes mistakes.

237
00:11:55,122 --> 00:11:57,469
All right, thanks.

238
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:02,981
- This is insane. - Okay, let's write in blood first.

239
00:12:06,862 --> 00:12:08,494
You from the cafe, you should write one too.

240
00:12:09,203 --> 00:12:10,395
Fill up the whole thing.

241
00:12:12,472 --> 00:12:13,595
Sorry?

242
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,800
Fill up this whole thing?

243
00:12:17,972 --> 00:12:19,299
(Evil landlord, cancel the rent increase immediately!)

244
00:12:27,222 --> 00:12:31,475
(Dear landlord,)

245
00:12:34,262 --> 00:12:35,861
(I grew up in a poor family.)

246
00:12:35,862 --> 00:12:37,792
(Unlike most families, we could never eat out.)

247
00:12:37,793 --> 00:12:39,631
(When my mom was at work,)

248
00:12:39,632 --> 00:12:41,302
(I always cooked instant noodles all alone.)

249
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:43,853
(Then I got so sick of instant noodles...)

250
00:12:48,173 --> 00:12:50,968
(and yelled at my mom, saying I wanted to eat...)

251
00:12:55,882 --> 00:12:59,282
(something nice. Then my mom took out her emergency fund...)

252
00:12:59,283 --> 00:13:01,088
(and ordered jajangmyeon for me.)

253
00:13:05,992 --> 00:13:09,900
(We can't afford this rent. She said she hates paying rent.)

254
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:18,011
(We are absolutely against this rent increase.)

255
00:13:23,773 --> 00:13:26,088
Finally, I'm done.

256
00:13:27,842 --> 00:13:28,965
Gosh, I'm dizzy.

257
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:37,873
Woo Shik.

258
00:13:38,722 --> 00:13:40,803
Soo Yeon, what are you doing here?

259
00:13:40,923 --> 00:13:43,473
I heard you're on a hunger strike, so I came to check on you.

260
00:13:44,132 --> 00:13:45,662
By the way, why are you doing this?

261
00:13:45,732 --> 00:13:48,762
- What? Well... - The boss made you do this, right?

262
00:13:49,063 --> 00:13:50,532
Shall I go say something to him?

263
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:51,930
Hey, no. Don't say anything.

264
00:13:52,972 --> 00:13:55,829
He didn't make me do this. I volunteered.

265
00:13:56,142 --> 00:13:58,763
I've always been very interested in rent issues.

266
00:13:59,443 --> 00:14:01,585
- Really? - Yes.

267
00:14:01,982 --> 00:14:04,196
So don't worry about me...

268
00:14:04,482 --> 00:14:05,840
and get back to work.

269
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,584
Don't get on his nerves again.

270
00:14:08,783 --> 00:14:10,006
Okay. I'll be off, then.

271
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,269
- Be careful. - I will.

272
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:20,968
This is crazy.

273
00:14:21,063 --> 00:14:24,193
All right. We're all done with our letters,

274
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:28,346
so let's go on a hunger strike now!

275
00:14:53,962 --> 00:14:55,595
- Sir. - Gosh, you startled me.

276
00:14:56,002 --> 00:14:57,131
You? Again?

277
00:14:57,132 --> 00:14:59,519
How many times did I tell you that I don't want to do it?

278
00:14:59,602 --> 00:15:01,275
- Leave. - I can't.

279
00:15:01,673 --> 00:15:04,812
I won't even budge until I get your permission.

280
00:15:04,813 --> 00:15:05,995
Sure, whatever.

281
00:15:07,242 --> 00:15:08,334
Sir.

282
00:15:08,612 --> 00:15:10,622
Sir! Sir...

283
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:37,538
I fell asleep.

284
00:15:57,092 --> 00:15:58,285
Come in.

285
00:16:01,403 --> 00:16:02,964
- Sir. - I lost.

286
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,495
Come on in.

287
00:16:07,673 --> 00:16:11,079
Thank you, sir.

288
00:16:14,242 --> 00:16:15,304
Sir, wait...

289
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,117
Put this on first.

290
00:16:30,193 --> 00:16:31,253
Wait.

291
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:35,432
You want me to put this on?

292
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:39,032
- What? Is it too dirty for you? - Well...

293
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:41,083
You said you wanted to experience our lives.

294
00:16:41,443 --> 00:16:42,800
If you're not even ready for this,

295
00:16:43,342 --> 00:16:44,872
you should go back.

296
00:16:46,313 --> 00:16:48,912
No. I'll put it on.

297
00:16:48,913 --> 00:16:50,544
I'll put it on.

298
00:16:55,923 --> 00:16:57,491
It fits you perfectly.

299
00:16:57,492 --> 00:16:58,574
I guess.

300
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,779
You skipped dinner, right? You must be hungry.

301
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,407
Eat this.

302
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:10,498
Okay. Thank you.

303
00:17:13,773 --> 00:17:16,242
It's covered in dirt.

304
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,569
Is it too dirty for you to eat?

305
00:17:17,573 --> 00:17:20,296
- This... - There's something we say.

306
00:17:20,642 --> 00:17:22,550
"Don't be afraid of eating food off the ground."

307
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:24,953
"Starvation is scarier."

308
00:17:25,452 --> 00:17:26,575
Still...

309
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,482
If you can't eat it, just go back.

310
00:17:28,483 --> 00:17:29,809
No!

311
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:31,673
I'll eat it.

312
00:17:32,293 --> 00:17:33,313
I'll eat it.

313
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:41,346
After eating, get some sleep.

314
00:17:41,503 --> 00:17:44,871
The real teaching starts tomorrow morning.

315
00:17:44,872 --> 00:17:45,892
Okay.

316
00:17:47,202 --> 00:17:48,222
Gosh.

317
00:17:48,243 --> 00:17:49,773
Goodnight, sir.

318
00:17:57,852 --> 00:18:00,128
Okay. See you tomorrow.

319
00:18:00,652 --> 00:18:01,703
What?

320
00:18:03,622 --> 00:18:06,550
When Cinderella doesn't get sleep, she becomes Mozzarella?

321
00:18:07,192 --> 00:18:08,416
That's hilarious.

322
00:18:08,723 --> 00:18:10,090
Right?

323
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:20,298
Byung Chul, you should go to bed. It's getting late.

324
00:18:22,543 --> 00:18:24,141
It's driving me crazy.

325
00:18:24,142 --> 00:18:25,397
You mean his laughter?

326
00:18:25,942 --> 00:18:27,242
You said he was fine except that.

327
00:18:27,243 --> 00:18:28,711
It's true,

328
00:18:28,813 --> 00:18:31,026
but I can't seem to get used to his laughter.

329
00:18:31,983 --> 00:18:34,982
By the way, how is your forkball going?

330
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:37,471
Thanks to Byung Chul, it's getting a lot better.

331
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:39,246
That's good at least.

332
00:18:41,493 --> 00:18:43,329
What are you looking at?

333
00:18:43,463 --> 00:18:45,762
I'm going to open a restaurant, remember?

334
00:18:45,763 --> 00:18:49,101
I'm doing some research for Yu Ri's Kitchen's interior design.

335
00:18:49,102 --> 00:18:50,256
Yu Ri's Kitchen?

336
00:18:51,102 --> 00:18:52,601
Oh, that chicken place.

337
00:18:52,602 --> 00:18:53,796
Chicken place?

338
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:58,272
Hey, it's Yu Ri's "Kitchen".

339
00:18:58,273 --> 00:19:00,689
Yes, it's a chicken place.

340
00:19:01,612 --> 00:19:04,082
By the way, what does "Yu Ri's" mean?

341
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,786
Forget it.

342
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:07,755
Why am I even talking to you?

343
00:19:09,323 --> 00:19:10,719
(2nd Day of Hunger Strike)

344
00:19:11,023 --> 00:19:13,919
(Evil landlord, cancel the rent increase immediately!)

345
00:19:14,963 --> 00:19:16,186
Gosh, I'm hungry.

346
00:19:17,192 --> 00:19:19,681
How long will this go on?

347
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:21,527
Should I just quit?

348
00:19:22,063 --> 00:19:23,123
No.

349
00:19:23,402 --> 00:19:26,392
I have to continue for Soo Yeon's sake.

350
00:19:26,773 --> 00:19:27,824
Of course.

351
00:19:28,473 --> 00:19:29,493
I can do this.

352
00:19:29,842 --> 00:19:33,892
I'll starve until they lower the rents.

353
00:19:36,013 --> 00:19:37,134
I'm so hungry.

354
00:19:42,823 --> 00:19:43,975
This place looks good.

355
00:19:44,023 --> 00:19:46,369
There are many people walking by and a lot of restaurants.

356
00:19:46,392 --> 00:19:48,157
I'm sure there are many people with change.

357
00:19:48,392 --> 00:19:49,994
It's perfect.

358
00:19:50,632 --> 00:19:52,602
Shall we start?

359
00:19:55,963 --> 00:19:57,461
Yes, sir.

360
00:20:01,872 --> 00:20:03,127
What are you doing?

361
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:04,333
Sorry?

362
00:20:06,142 --> 00:20:07,713
This isn't what I'm supposed to do?

363
00:20:07,842 --> 00:20:09,618
There's something we say.

364
00:20:10,013 --> 00:20:13,073
"Instead of lowering your body, stir up people's hearts."

365
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,951
The core of begging is stirring up people's hearts.

366
00:20:16,952 --> 00:20:18,621
What exactly am I supposed to do?

367
00:20:18,622 --> 00:20:19,673
Eye contact.

368
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,034
In other words, your eyes have to meet theirs.

369
00:20:22,463 --> 00:20:25,757
And the key to eye contact is the way you look at them.

370
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:29,332
You have to force them to open their wallets...

371
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,006
with your eyes.

372
00:20:31,672 --> 00:20:33,871
How exactly do you do that?

373
00:20:33,872 --> 00:20:35,272
Let me show you.

374
00:20:35,273 --> 00:20:36,293
Okay.

375
00:20:38,543 --> 00:20:39,594
Can you see?

376
00:20:40,313 --> 00:20:43,474
You can't find even a tiny bit of hope in my eyes.

377
00:20:43,612 --> 00:20:45,213
My eyes are completely empty.

378
00:20:45,753 --> 00:20:48,813
Without your help, I'll fall to the ground at any moment.

379
00:20:49,622 --> 00:20:51,387
The totally hopeless look.

380
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:54,292
Yes, I can see it.

381
00:20:54,293 --> 00:20:56,262
All right. Try it.

382
00:20:56,263 --> 00:20:57,354
Okay, sir.

383
00:21:01,432 --> 00:21:03,161
That's not it.

384
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:05,171
I can still see hope in your eyes.

385
00:21:05,602 --> 00:21:06,928
Do you have some money in your pocket?

386
00:21:08,543 --> 00:21:10,409
Yes, I do.

387
00:21:11,043 --> 00:21:12,911
- I knew it. - I can't believe this.

388
00:21:12,912 --> 00:21:16,820
As long as you have money in your pocket, you have hope.

389
00:21:17,112 --> 00:21:19,282
Now try again.

390
00:21:19,283 --> 00:21:20,334
Okay, sir.

391
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:23,702
No!

392
00:21:23,993 --> 00:21:25,451
It's wrong again!

393
00:21:25,692 --> 00:21:27,426
Is there anything you can do properly?

394
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:29,292
At your age, you still get only minor roles.

395
00:21:29,293 --> 00:21:31,532
You can't even do that well, so you're here to learn how to beg.

396
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:35,072
If you can't even do as I say, how are you going to act?

397
00:21:35,233 --> 00:21:38,293
You're even more pathetic than I am. Do you realize that?

398
00:21:40,402 --> 00:21:42,483
Yes, you're finally doing it right.

399
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:45,668
I can't find any hope in your eyes.

400
00:21:45,813 --> 00:21:48,393
Remember how you look right now.

401
00:21:48,543 --> 00:21:49,604
Okay?

402
00:21:49,813 --> 00:21:50,851
Yes, sir.

403
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:51,903
All right.

404
00:21:53,983 --> 00:21:56,399
Let's get to work then.

405
00:22:01,692 --> 00:22:03,621
(2nd Day of Hunger Strike)

406
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:04,891
(3rd Day of Hunger Strike)

407
00:22:04,892 --> 00:22:05,891
(Cancel Immediately!)

408
00:22:05,892 --> 00:22:07,191
(No Rent Increase!)

409
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,232
(4th Day of Hunger Strike)

410
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:09,401
(No Rent Increase during Recession!)

411
00:22:09,402 --> 00:22:10,431
(4th Day of Hunger Strike)

412
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,772
(5th Day of Hunger Strike)

413
00:22:11,773 --> 00:22:13,874
(Protect Tenants' Right to Live!)

414
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:16,094
No.

415
00:22:16,773 --> 00:22:18,782
You can't go there.

416
00:22:20,073 --> 00:22:25,153
Don't cross that river.

417
00:22:26,253 --> 00:22:28,089
(Protect Tenants' Right to Live!)

418
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:29,580
(No Rent Increase!)

419
00:22:30,422 --> 00:22:31,983
It was a dream.

420
00:22:32,523 --> 00:22:33,919
I thought I was really dying.

421
00:22:35,463 --> 00:22:36,717
Gosh, I'm hungry.

422
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,972
What if I really starve to death?

423
00:22:40,563 --> 00:22:42,163
Is there any food?

424
00:22:44,872 --> 00:22:46,362
I'm starving.

425
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:49,793
Sir!

426
00:22:52,513 --> 00:22:54,624
Look at all these buns.

427
00:22:57,583 --> 00:23:00,282
I got these expired buns from the convenience store.

428
00:23:00,283 --> 00:23:02,159
It's been expired for only three days.

429
00:23:03,323 --> 00:23:05,088
Good job.

430
00:23:07,392 --> 00:23:09,667
I thought I got 5. Why are there only 4?

431
00:23:11,392 --> 00:23:13,025
I must have dropped one on my way here.

432
00:23:13,563 --> 00:23:14,583
Where is it?

433
00:23:14,662 --> 00:23:17,487
Forget it. Let's get back to work.

434
00:23:17,573 --> 00:23:18,653
Yes, sir.

435
00:23:19,872 --> 00:23:22,117
What kind of punk picked it up?

436
00:23:22,642 --> 00:23:24,172
I hope he gets food poisoning.

437
00:23:25,372 --> 00:23:26,463
We still have four buns.

438
00:23:45,563 --> 00:23:46,653
Thank you.

439
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:55,272
It's getting late. Let's call it a day.

440
00:23:55,273 --> 00:23:56,272
Yes, sir.

441
00:23:56,273 --> 00:23:59,199
Let's see how much we got today.

442
00:24:01,783 --> 00:24:04,772
Goodness. You got that much?

443
00:24:06,283 --> 00:24:08,393
It's all thanks to your teaching.

444
00:24:08,523 --> 00:24:10,082
You're better than me now.

445
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,348
No way.

446
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:15,246
You should stop now.

447
00:24:18,662 --> 00:24:21,131
What do you mean?

448
00:24:21,132 --> 00:24:23,377
I have nothing more to teach you.

449
00:24:23,803 --> 00:24:26,485
You totally look like a beggar now.

450
00:24:26,773 --> 00:24:28,609
You look even more like a beggar than me.

451
00:24:29,142 --> 00:24:32,030
So you can leave now.

452
00:24:32,243 --> 00:24:35,042
- Sir. - If you keep this attitude,

453
00:24:35,043 --> 00:24:37,282
you'll surely be...

454
00:24:37,283 --> 00:24:41,464
the best beggar actor in the country, or even the world.

455
00:24:42,152 --> 00:24:43,172
Okay.

456
00:24:44,293 --> 00:24:45,475
I'll remember your words.

457
00:24:45,922 --> 00:24:48,921
Thank you so much for your teaching.

458
00:24:49,993 --> 00:24:51,624
Let me give you a bow.

459
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:54,924
You don't have to...

460
00:24:59,303 --> 00:25:01,853
I guess this is the last time I'll ever see you.

461
00:25:03,273 --> 00:25:06,944
I have a present for you.

462
00:25:08,142 --> 00:25:09,234
Pardon?

463
00:25:09,882 --> 00:25:11,107
A present?

464
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:13,673
How did you find it?

465
00:25:14,523 --> 00:25:17,351
Jung Eun, isn't this a fertilizer bag?

466
00:25:17,352 --> 00:25:19,752
That's right. Among plastic bags,

467
00:25:19,753 --> 00:25:22,313
fertilizer bags are apparently the warmest.

468
00:25:22,422 --> 00:25:26,136
My goodness. You're the beggar of beggars.

469
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,579
No. You're the queen of beggars.

470
00:25:30,533 --> 00:25:32,871
By the way, where is Jun Ki?

471
00:25:32,872 --> 00:25:35,002
He's been out of reach for days.

472
00:25:35,003 --> 00:25:36,808
- I'm not sure... - I'm here!

473
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:58,492
Hello, director.

474
00:25:58,493 --> 00:26:01,185
Hi. What happened?

475
00:26:01,202 --> 00:26:03,304
You somehow give off a completely different vibe.

476
00:26:05,132 --> 00:26:06,500
- I do? - Yes.

477
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:09,042
I thought a real beggar was walking towards me.

478
00:26:09,043 --> 00:26:12,242
Jun Ki, where have you been? You didn't even come home.

479
00:26:12,243 --> 00:26:13,905
I received some acting lessons... No.

480
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,934
I received some lessons about life.

481
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,575
What?

482
00:26:21,152 --> 00:26:24,052
("The Local Beggar, Jo Dal Ho")

483
00:26:24,053 --> 00:26:27,255
All right. This scene is where beggars are begging on the street,

484
00:26:27,422 --> 00:26:29,921
and when Beggar number one brings some bread, you suddenly...

485
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,891
start fighting fiercely in order to eat that bread. Okay?

486
00:26:31,892 --> 00:26:32,891
- Okay. - Okay.

487
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:33,953
- Get ready. - Okay.

488
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,781
Ready, action!

489
00:26:38,172 --> 00:26:39,254
Gosh.

490
00:26:39,303 --> 00:26:43,148
I used to be an attorney. How did I end up like this?

491
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:45,272
I cannot believe this.

492
00:26:45,273 --> 00:26:47,641
What are you doing? Aren't you going to beg?

493
00:26:47,642 --> 00:26:50,805
- Bow down and beg. - Okay, I will.

494
00:26:54,922 --> 00:26:56,891
There's something we say.

495
00:26:57,023 --> 00:27:00,011
"Instead of lowering your body, stir up people's hearts."

496
00:27:00,392 --> 00:27:01,586
People's hearts.

497
00:27:02,422 --> 00:27:04,982
Eye contact. Your eyes have to meet theirs.

498
00:27:05,432 --> 00:27:08,971
And the key to eye contact is the way you look at them.

499
00:27:09,563 --> 00:27:11,802
What is wrong with Jun Ki? Why isn't he begging?

500
00:27:11,803 --> 00:27:14,495
Hold on, just leave him. It looks fine.

501
00:27:15,573 --> 00:27:17,756
Gosh, look at his eyes.

502
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:23,181
Guys, I've brought some bread.

503
00:27:23,182 --> 00:27:25,482
- Let's share this. - Bread!

504
00:27:25,483 --> 00:27:27,523
- Wait! - Give it to me!

505
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,693
Bread! I have to eat it! It's mine!

506
00:27:33,523 --> 00:27:36,419
Hey, what is wrong with you? Let go of me.

507
00:27:37,223 --> 00:27:38,824
Hey, let go of me!

508
00:27:45,202 --> 00:27:47,140
There's something we say.

509
00:27:47,702 --> 00:27:49,885
"Don't be afraid of eating food off the ground."

510
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:52,919
"Starvation is scarier."

511
00:27:53,442 --> 00:27:54,972
I said, let go of me!

512
00:28:00,352 --> 00:28:02,423
Camera, zoom in on Lee Jun Ki.

513
00:28:12,632 --> 00:28:14,020
Okay, cut!

514
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:17,116
That was amazing! I love it.

515
00:28:18,803 --> 00:28:21,322
Especially, I liked Jun Ki's acting!

516
00:28:22,842 --> 00:28:23,964
I'm so flattered, sir.

517
00:28:24,273 --> 00:28:25,742
You're so modest.

518
00:28:25,743 --> 00:28:28,042
But you didn't have to eat bread off the ground.

519
00:28:28,043 --> 00:28:29,104
No!

520
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:32,510
If you're hungry, you should be able to eat dirt and anything filthier.

521
00:28:32,682 --> 00:28:34,487
I believe that's what a true beggar is!

522
00:28:34,553 --> 00:28:35,573
Goodness.

523
00:28:35,753 --> 00:28:39,261
You've become a totally different person in the last few days.

524
00:28:40,723 --> 00:28:42,150
You should watch and learn.

525
00:28:42,392 --> 00:28:45,217
This is what you call a true actor.

526
00:28:45,463 --> 00:28:47,024
Everyone, give him a big hand.

527
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:50,684
Good job.

528
00:28:53,172 --> 00:28:54,499
- Great job, Jun Ki. - Good job.

529
00:28:54,642 --> 00:28:56,743
No need to compliment me. It was nothing.

530
00:28:57,172 --> 00:29:00,131
It was nothing. Stop, you're flattering me.

531
00:29:01,142 --> 00:29:03,712
(6th Day of Hunger Strike)

532
00:29:03,713 --> 00:29:05,181
(Evil landlord, cancel the rent increase immediately!)

533
00:29:05,182 --> 00:29:08,851
Sir, can we please stop the hunger strike now?

534
00:29:08,852 --> 00:29:11,651
- We're all going to die. - She is right.

535
00:29:11,652 --> 00:29:14,681
The landlord doesn't care at all. What's the point of continuing?

536
00:29:15,592 --> 00:29:16,683
All right.

537
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:20,395
But we cannot just give up like this.

538
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:24,607
Isn't there another way to protest besides starving?

539
00:29:25,102 --> 00:29:28,233
How about we shave our heads then?

540
00:29:28,942 --> 00:29:30,096
Shave our heads?

541
00:29:30,303 --> 00:29:31,496
That sounds good.

542
00:29:31,912 --> 00:29:33,167
Shave our heads?

543
00:29:33,573 --> 00:29:36,193
Shave our heads? What is this gibberish?

544
00:29:36,213 --> 00:29:39,911
But it's unreasonable for all of us to shave our heads...

545
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:41,280
so just one person can represent us.

546
00:29:41,553 --> 00:29:45,020
Who wants to do it? Is there a volunteer?

547
00:29:48,293 --> 00:29:49,383
No one?

548
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:52,389
What shall we do then?

549
00:29:52,533 --> 00:29:54,604
Is there a fair way we can decide?

550
00:29:54,662 --> 00:29:56,947
Sir, leave that up to me.

551
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:59,960
Gosh, Mr. Park from the twin's event.

552
00:30:00,102 --> 00:30:01,572
Do you have an idea?

553
00:30:01,573 --> 00:30:04,428
I used to be a recreational instructor before.

554
00:30:04,642 --> 00:30:07,341
Whenever we have to choose someone from a group of people,

555
00:30:07,342 --> 00:30:09,729
- the number game is the best. - The number game?

556
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,306
That sounds great!

557
00:30:12,513 --> 00:30:14,695
All right everybody, get up.

558
00:30:14,753 --> 00:30:16,354
Stand up already.

559
00:30:16,922 --> 00:30:20,289
(Evil landlord, cancel the rent increase immediately!)

560
00:30:20,753 --> 00:30:22,190
You all know the number game, right?

561
00:30:22,563 --> 00:30:24,492
The loser has to shave off his or her head.

562
00:30:24,493 --> 00:30:26,705
We'll begin when I say "start". Start, one!

563
00:30:26,892 --> 00:30:29,790
Hey, how could you play as soon as you say "start"... Two!

564
00:30:30,202 --> 00:30:31,601
Wait, what is happening?

565
00:30:31,602 --> 00:30:32,701
What is this situation?

566
00:30:32,702 --> 00:30:34,002
You guys are so cheap.

567
00:30:34,003 --> 00:30:35,329
You should play fairly... Three.

568
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:39,264
- 4. - 4.

569
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,477
It's decided then!

570
00:30:44,213 --> 00:30:47,476
This guy from the live cafe and Ms. Kim from the beauty salon.

571
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:49,664
Why did you shout out at that timing!

572
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:52,522
Okay, then. We need to choose between the two of you.

573
00:30:52,523 --> 00:30:54,225
- What should we do? - Don't worry.

574
00:30:54,323 --> 00:30:56,363
We have the "Tangsuyuk Game".

575
00:30:56,862 --> 00:31:00,463
You both know how to play the Tangsuyuk Game, right?

576
00:31:04,003 --> 00:31:07,439
Get ready, begin!

577
00:31:08,342 --> 00:31:09,423
- Tang. - Su.

578
00:31:09,672 --> 00:31:10,671
- Yuk. - Tang.

579
00:31:10,672 --> 00:31:11,692
- Su. Tang! - Yuk. Tang.

580
00:31:18,013 --> 00:31:20,939
No!

581
00:31:23,823 --> 00:31:25,091
(Evil landlord, cancel the rent increase immediately!)

582
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:27,642
Okay. From now on,

583
00:31:28,192 --> 00:31:32,272
to protest against the evil landlord for increasing our rents unfairly,

584
00:31:32,533 --> 00:31:35,725
we will begin the head shaving ceremony!

585
00:31:36,432 --> 00:31:38,004
(Evil landlord, cancel the rent increase immediately!)

586
00:31:41,202 --> 00:31:42,936
Okay, then. Shall we begin?

587
00:31:43,543 --> 00:31:44,664
Wait, sir.

588
00:31:45,043 --> 00:31:47,256
Can I have one last phone call?

589
00:31:55,753 --> 00:31:58,475
Hello? It's me. The thing is...

590
00:31:59,122 --> 00:32:00,927
They want me to shave my head.

591
00:32:03,323 --> 00:32:05,373
What did you say? Hold on.

592
00:32:05,793 --> 00:32:07,874
Mr. Firefighter! It's this way.

593
00:32:08,503 --> 00:32:10,931
Hey, Soo Yeon was cooking and set the kitchen on fire.

594
00:32:10,932 --> 00:32:12,606
The firefighters are here right now.

595
00:32:12,872 --> 00:32:14,912
What did you just say? Shave what?

596
00:32:16,642 --> 00:32:17,826
I'll do it.

597
00:32:18,243 --> 00:32:20,048
I'll shave my head.

598
00:32:22,612 --> 00:32:24,173
Darn it.

599
00:32:26,682 --> 00:32:27,906
You may begin.

600
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:31,181
Ms. Kim from Sook Hee Beauty Salon on the third floor...

601
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:33,497
will perform the head shaving ceremony.

602
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:36,745
(No Rent Increase!)

603
00:32:42,733 --> 00:32:44,059
I'll get started right away.

604
00:33:09,662 --> 00:33:11,050
Stop right now!

605
00:33:13,233 --> 00:33:15,445
- Who are you? - I'm the landlord's attorney.

606
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:18,661
He said he will cancel increasing the rent.

607
00:33:19,073 --> 00:33:21,693
- What? - So please stop now.

608
00:33:21,973 --> 00:33:23,981
What did you say? Oh, my.

609
00:33:24,872 --> 00:33:27,742
Oh, my gosh. What on earth...

610
00:33:27,743 --> 00:33:29,082
Are you serious?

611
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:31,052
Yes, I'm telling you!

612
00:33:32,483 --> 00:33:36,021
Everyone, he has decided to cancel the rent increase!

613
00:33:36,382 --> 00:33:40,121
- We won! - We won!

614
00:33:40,122 --> 00:33:41,693
- We won! - We won!

615
00:33:42,192 --> 00:33:44,742
Darn it. Why didn't you tell us one minute earlier?

616
00:33:45,763 --> 00:33:47,089
What is this?

617
00:33:47,733 --> 00:33:49,365
What is this hole on my head!

618
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,572
You're so pathetic.

619
00:33:58,573 --> 00:33:59,611
You almost shaved your head because of Soo Yeon...

620
00:33:59,612 --> 00:34:00,663
and got a hole in your head.

621
00:34:00,912 --> 00:34:02,952
This is such a sad love story.

622
00:34:03,412 --> 00:34:05,252
Hey, stop teasing me.

623
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:06,783
I'm stressed out enough already.

624
00:34:07,952 --> 00:34:09,044
Darn it.

625
00:34:10,622 --> 00:34:11,744
Hey, Soo Yeon.

626
00:34:12,322 --> 00:34:14,740
- Woo Shik. - Hey.

627
00:34:17,593 --> 00:34:18,817
What is it?

628
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:21,922
- How do you feel? - I'm okay.

629
00:34:22,733 --> 00:34:23,988
What is that?

630
00:34:24,202 --> 00:34:25,294
Oh, this?

631
00:34:25,503 --> 00:34:28,101
I found out that if you eat immediately after starving,

632
00:34:28,102 --> 00:34:29,326
you might get an upset stomach.

633
00:34:29,673 --> 00:34:32,426
So I made some porridge for you. Do you want to try it?

634
00:34:32,472 --> 00:34:33,636
Porridge?

635
00:34:35,343 --> 00:34:37,628
Oh, thank you, Soo Yeon.

636
00:34:37,813 --> 00:34:39,252
Don't mention it.

637
00:34:39,253 --> 00:34:41,771
You introduced me to that job. I should at least do this much.

638
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:44,245
I hope you enjoy it.

639
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:54,092
Hey, Ki Bong, look at this.

640
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:55,931
Soo Yeon made porridge for me.

641
00:34:55,932 --> 00:34:58,402
Goodness. You were practically a dead man just now.

642
00:34:58,403 --> 00:35:00,473
- Are you that happy? - Yes, I'm so happy.

643
00:35:00,572 --> 00:35:03,805
The hole on my head doesn't matter. I can even shave it all off.

644
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:06,151
Soo Yeon made porridge for me.

645
00:35:06,472 --> 00:35:08,350
This just looks too good to eat.

646
00:35:08,713 --> 00:35:10,273
Still, I should have a bite.

647
00:35:17,552 --> 00:35:18,643
Gosh.

648
00:35:19,122 --> 00:35:20,449
This really tastes bad.

649
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,391
How could it taste so terribly?

650
00:35:22,963 --> 00:35:24,626
Still, I'm so happy.

651
00:35:25,193 --> 00:35:26,213
What an idiot.

652
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:34,058
Jun Ki, I learned so much from you today.

653
00:35:34,233 --> 00:35:36,201
You learned from me? What?

654
00:35:36,202 --> 00:35:39,201
To be honest, I saw that bread when it dropped to the ground,

655
00:35:39,443 --> 00:35:41,342
but I never thought of picking it up and eating it.

656
00:35:41,343 --> 00:35:43,077
Gosh. That was nothing.

657
00:35:45,713 --> 00:35:49,119
Jung Eun, true acting is...

658
00:35:49,452 --> 00:35:51,187
not trying to act like someone else.

659
00:35:51,452 --> 00:35:54,309
I believe you have to actually become that person.

660
00:35:55,093 --> 00:35:57,918
So if you want to act like a beggar,

661
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:01,902
you must first become a real beggar to truly act.

662
00:36:01,903 --> 00:36:03,228
That's what I mean.

663
00:36:03,733 --> 00:36:07,271
This is the difference between a professional and an amateur.

664
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:10,091
Sir, don't you think this should be edited out?

665
00:36:10,642 --> 00:36:13,397
- What's wrong with this? - It's gross.

666
00:36:13,412 --> 00:36:15,351
Even real homeless people don't do that these days.

667
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:17,141
Our drama airs at dinnertime.

668
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:18,681
We might get complaints.

669
00:36:18,682 --> 00:36:20,009
You think so?

670
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,114
It does look pretty gross.

671
00:36:22,153 --> 00:36:23,275
Just edit out this part, then.

672
00:36:23,423 --> 00:36:26,686
Actually, edit out all the parts that this guy is in.

673
00:36:26,693 --> 00:36:27,743
Sure.

674
00:36:28,923 --> 00:36:30,289
When it comes to acting,

675
00:36:30,423 --> 00:36:32,809
just doing research isn't enough.

676
00:36:32,863 --> 00:36:35,431
You have to meet someone in that specific situation.

677
00:36:35,432 --> 00:36:39,132
You need to eat with the person and practically live with him...

678
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:42,407
to be able to portray a homeless person in a realistic manner.

679
00:36:42,503 --> 00:36:43,871
I see.

680
00:36:43,872 --> 00:36:47,646
It's called "method acting".

681
00:36:47,742 --> 00:36:48,762
Got it?

682
00:36:49,142 --> 00:36:50,382
- What did I say? - Method acting.

683
00:36:50,383 --> 00:36:51,464
That's right, "method".

684
00:36:55,852 --> 00:36:58,199
How is it? Do you like the steak?

685
00:36:58,322 --> 00:36:59,985
Yes, it's good.

686
00:37:00,322 --> 00:37:02,260
I'm sorry I haven't been in touch.

687
00:37:02,293 --> 00:37:03,692
I had to train a lot,

688
00:37:03,693 --> 00:37:06,651
and there's something I've been working on, so I've been quite busy.

689
00:37:06,793 --> 00:37:08,189
What's the thing you've been working on?

690
00:37:08,762 --> 00:37:10,315
It's a secret. I'll tell you about it later.

691
00:37:10,339 --> 00:37:11,442
I'll tell you about it later.

692
00:37:12,923 --> 00:37:13,729
Okay.

693
00:37:13,729 --> 00:37:15,571
By the way, is Ki Bong picking up...

694
00:37:15,572 --> 00:37:17,601
the forkball technique or whatever it's called?

695
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:20,019
I've been training him on it, but I'm not sure.

696
00:37:20,543 --> 00:37:21,910
He's so dumb, you know.

697
00:37:22,543 --> 00:37:26,327
Come on. Please train him well.

698
00:37:26,682 --> 00:37:29,783
I will. Yu Ri, you should eat your food before it gets cold.

699
00:37:29,923 --> 00:37:30,943
Okay.

700
00:37:31,552 --> 00:37:35,602
Oh, my. Without that weird laugh, he's perfect.

701
00:37:43,032 --> 00:37:45,787
I'm sorry. The pepper is making me sneeze.

702
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:49,936
What? What's he doing?

703
00:37:50,343 --> 00:37:51,871
What is this? What's going on?

704
00:37:51,872 --> 00:37:53,942
Why does his sneeze sound like that?

705
00:37:53,943 --> 00:37:55,616
This isn't good. I should drink some water.

706
00:38:01,852 --> 00:38:03,892
What? What is this now?

707
00:38:04,153 --> 00:38:07,213
I can't believe this. Is he getting hiccups?

708
00:38:10,392 --> 00:38:12,841
What is wrong with this man?

709
00:38:22,503 --> 00:38:23,593
Hey, Ki Bong.

710
00:38:24,072 --> 00:38:25,265
Coach.

711
00:38:25,673 --> 00:38:27,772
It's getting late. Why are you still here?

712
00:38:27,773 --> 00:38:30,088
Well, I had things to practice.

713
00:38:30,113 --> 00:38:32,835
By the way, didn't you just throw a forkball?

714
00:38:33,383 --> 00:38:37,321
Yes. You said I should learn another breaking ball technique,

715
00:38:37,322 --> 00:38:39,192
so I started practicing it recently.

716
00:38:39,193 --> 00:38:40,243
Oh, really?

717
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:43,277
I must say, that was pretty good.

718
00:38:43,423 --> 00:38:45,023
The angle was good as well.

719
00:38:45,432 --> 00:38:48,531
But isn't it too much for your injured shoulder?

720
00:38:48,532 --> 00:38:49,552
Not at all.

721
00:38:50,463 --> 00:38:51,524
It's totally fine.

722
00:38:53,032 --> 00:38:55,502
Really? Then I'll be your catcher.

723
00:38:55,503 --> 00:38:56,767
Try it again.

724
00:38:57,443 --> 00:38:58,493
Okay, Coach.

725
00:39:18,762 --> 00:39:22,476
(The Last Match)

726
00:39:27,102 --> 00:39:29,801
He goes, "Cuckoo", when he's getting hiccups?

727
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:31,435
There's more.

728
00:39:31,472 --> 00:39:33,074
Do you know what his sneezes sound like?

729
00:39:33,512 --> 00:39:34,872
Meow, meow.

730
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:35,966
That's what it sounds like.

731
00:39:35,983 --> 00:39:38,258
Anyway, I can't take this anymore.

732
00:39:38,383 --> 00:39:39,781
I'll break up with him tomorrow.

733
00:39:39,782 --> 00:39:41,152
Then what about Ki Bong?

734
00:39:41,153 --> 00:39:43,051
He won't train Ki Bong on the forkball if you end it.

735
00:39:43,052 --> 00:39:45,848
Right, I forgot about that.

736
00:39:46,653 --> 00:39:48,499
Gosh, this is ridiculous.

737
00:39:48,593 --> 00:39:50,661
Ki Bong drives me up the wall.

738
00:39:50,662 --> 00:39:52,632
Hey, guys!

739
00:39:52,963 --> 00:39:54,592
Big news. I have big news!

740
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:57,002
What is it? What's with all this fuss?

741
00:39:57,003 --> 00:40:00,196
Guys, I'll be re-evaluated tomorrow for the major league.

742
00:40:00,572 --> 00:40:02,471
My coach saw me practicing...

743
00:40:02,472 --> 00:40:05,371
and called the major league coach, and he said he'd come see me.

744
00:40:05,372 --> 00:40:07,312
Seriously? That's great news.

745
00:40:07,313 --> 00:40:09,542
Hold on. So I don't have to...

746
00:40:09,543 --> 00:40:11,276
- see Byung Chul anymore? - What?

747
00:40:12,512 --> 00:40:14,859
Does he irk you that much?

748
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:15,922
Whatever, it doesn't matter.

749
00:40:15,923 --> 00:40:18,575
I'll break up with him tomorrow, so consider yourself informed.

750
00:40:19,452 --> 00:40:21,054
Why are you laughing? Yu Ri.

751
00:40:21,423 --> 00:40:22,586
Hey, Yu Ri!

752
00:40:24,992 --> 00:40:26,971
What am I going to say to Byung Chul?

753
00:40:33,602 --> 00:40:36,254
Who are you? What are you doing?

754
00:40:37,642 --> 00:40:39,812
Pervert!

755
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:42,681
When I got out of the shower, I saw the pervert...

756
00:40:42,682 --> 00:40:44,982
- smelling my clothes. - This is crazy.

757
00:40:44,983 --> 00:40:46,513
- Where did this pervert come from? - And...

758
00:40:46,952 --> 00:40:48,238
- When did he sneak in? - he ran away.

759
00:40:48,952 --> 00:40:50,152
I'm back.

760
00:40:50,153 --> 00:40:51,408
- Hey, you. - What did he look like?

761
00:40:51,722 --> 00:40:53,792
What's going on? What are cops doing here?

762
00:40:53,793 --> 00:40:54,851
Did something happen?

763
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:57,984
Well, a pervert snuck into the female dormitory.

764
00:40:58,162 --> 00:40:59,284
What? A pervert?

765
00:40:59,863 --> 00:41:01,832
So? Did you guys catch him?

766
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:03,902
No, he sprinted.

767
00:41:03,903 --> 00:41:04,984
My goodness.

768
00:41:05,202 --> 00:41:07,402
Hey, isn't that a snake?

769
00:41:07,403 --> 00:41:08,493
Yes, it is.

770
00:41:08,602 --> 00:41:10,442
It's my director friend's snake.

771
00:41:10,443 --> 00:41:12,011
He's going abroad for a location scout,

772
00:41:12,012 --> 00:41:13,241
so I offered to take care of it.

773
00:41:13,242 --> 00:41:15,342
Still, you can't bring it here.

774
00:41:15,343 --> 00:41:17,485
How could I say no to a director?

775
00:41:17,682 --> 00:41:18,774
Don't worry.

776
00:41:18,813 --> 00:41:21,712
Anne Hathaway Scarlett Johansson Megan Fox Junior is very gentle.

777
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:23,997
- What? Anne Hathaway what? - That's this snake's name.

778
00:41:24,122 --> 00:41:26,121
The director put together the names of his favorite actresses.

779
00:41:26,122 --> 00:41:27,551
Really?

780
00:41:27,722 --> 00:41:29,422
Hey, what if it's venomous?

781
00:41:29,423 --> 00:41:30,422
Venomous?

782
00:41:30,423 --> 00:41:33,062
Come on. It is, of course. It's mildly venomous.

783
00:41:33,063 --> 00:41:34,491
But you won't die even if you get bitten.

784
00:41:34,733 --> 00:41:36,502
I'm already stressed out because of the pervert.

785
00:41:36,503 --> 00:41:37,601
Why did you bring this snake?

786
00:41:37,602 --> 00:41:40,121
Don't worry, you punk. I'll take care of it.

787
00:41:40,173 --> 00:41:43,502
Anne Hathaway Scarlett Johansson Megan Fox Junior, do you want food?

788
00:41:43,503 --> 00:41:46,369
It's time to eat.

789
00:41:49,213 --> 00:41:53,701
(Alarm, 5:00am)

790
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:02,694
Gosh, it's already 5am.

791
00:42:05,063 --> 00:42:06,969
I should get moving for my training.

792
00:42:20,742 --> 00:42:22,681
What are you going to do now? What will you do?

793
00:42:22,682 --> 00:42:23,781
You said you'd take care of it.

794
00:42:23,782 --> 00:42:27,384
I had no idea it'd open the lid and sneak out.

795
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:29,522
Gosh, I'll be in big trouble if the director finds out.

796
00:42:29,523 --> 00:42:32,351
Is that important now? What if our guests see it?

797
00:42:32,352 --> 00:42:34,951
Exactly. That pervert already caused an uproar.

798
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:36,391
We can't have a snake crawling around.

799
00:42:36,392 --> 00:42:38,192
This is serious. If word gets out,

800
00:42:38,193 --> 00:42:39,866
we'll have to shut our business down.

801
00:42:40,193 --> 00:42:42,402
Guys, let's find the snake first.

802
00:42:42,403 --> 00:42:43,453
All right.

803
00:42:43,532 --> 00:42:45,337
Gosh, you're such a troublemaker.

804
00:42:47,173 --> 00:42:48,631
Hathaway...

805
00:42:49,173 --> 00:42:50,396
This is driving me crazy.

806
00:42:53,043 --> 00:42:54,879
What are you all doing here at this early hour?

807
00:42:54,912 --> 00:42:55,911
Is this a treasure hunt?

808
00:42:55,912 --> 00:42:57,341
Yu Ri, we have a big problem.

809
00:42:57,443 --> 00:42:58,982
The snake Jun Ki brought is gone.

810
00:42:58,983 --> 00:43:00,882
What? How did that happen?

811
00:43:00,883 --> 00:43:03,738
I don't even know. Help us find it.

812
00:43:03,782 --> 00:43:07,322
Sorry. I can't help you because I'm heading out to meet Byung Chul.

813
00:43:07,423 --> 00:43:09,922
I told you that I'm breaking up with him today.

814
00:43:09,923 --> 00:43:11,721
What? That's not important now!

815
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:13,630
To me, it's the most important thing right now.

816
00:43:14,563 --> 00:43:16,542
Well, then. Good luck.

817
00:43:17,563 --> 00:43:18,695
Yu Ri, wait!

818
00:43:19,003 --> 00:43:20,706
Gosh, she's so self-centered.

819
00:43:21,572 --> 00:43:23,205
Anne Hathaway Megan Fox.

820
00:43:23,673 --> 00:43:24,693
Goodness, whatever.

821
00:43:26,072 --> 00:43:27,398
Let's just go in first.

822
00:43:27,472 --> 00:43:29,982
Byung Chul, I told you there's something I have to tell you.

823
00:43:29,983 --> 00:43:32,838
You can tell me later. Take a look.

824
00:43:34,353 --> 00:43:35,953
What is this place?

825
00:43:36,622 --> 00:43:38,721
I bought this restaurant recently.

826
00:43:38,722 --> 00:43:39,742
What?

827
00:43:40,722 --> 00:43:42,522
Why did you suddenly decide to buy a restaurant?

828
00:43:42,523 --> 00:43:44,400
My friends and I...

829
00:43:44,492 --> 00:43:46,839
have been getting ready to open a restaurant together.

830
00:43:48,133 --> 00:43:49,761
I'll be retiring soon,

831
00:43:49,762 --> 00:43:51,905
I bought it to get ready for my retirement.

832
00:43:52,072 --> 00:43:53,358
I see.

833
00:43:53,472 --> 00:43:55,672
Byung Chul, I have to tell you...

834
00:43:55,673 --> 00:43:56,795
That said,

835
00:43:56,972 --> 00:44:00,644
I want you to run the kitchen here.

836
00:44:01,242 --> 00:44:02,241
What?

837
00:44:02,242 --> 00:44:03,365
Megan Fox Junior.

838
00:44:04,682 --> 00:44:06,009
Where are you?

839
00:44:06,412 --> 00:44:08,422
Anne Hathaway Megan Fox...

840
00:44:10,322 --> 00:44:11,547
I found it!

841
00:44:12,392 --> 00:44:14,464
Amazing. Hey, stay right there. Don't go anywhere!

842
00:44:17,222 --> 00:44:18,415
I saw it going into this room.

843
00:44:20,093 --> 00:44:21,317
It must be somewhere in this room.

844
00:44:24,633 --> 00:44:25,653
It's probably there.

845
00:44:26,673 --> 00:44:27,896
You, troublemaker.

846
00:44:27,932 --> 00:44:29,881
Come to me, baby.

847
00:44:32,043 --> 00:44:34,113
I'll scold you.

848
00:44:35,943 --> 00:44:37,136
Where did it go?

849
00:44:38,512 --> 00:44:40,382
I wonder if they still haven't caught that pervert.

850
00:44:40,383 --> 00:44:43,443
I feel like he's still in this room. It gives me the creeps.

851
00:44:43,583 --> 00:44:46,072
Come on. He wouldn't come back here unless he's a complete lunatic.

852
00:44:46,352 --> 00:44:47,851
Let's get changed and rest.

853
00:44:48,693 --> 00:44:49,713
I'm so tired.

854
00:44:52,093 --> 00:44:53,154
My gosh.

855
00:44:54,193 --> 00:44:56,242
Darn it. This is insane.

856
00:44:56,802 --> 00:44:59,455
If I get out now, they'll totally get the wrong idea.

857
00:45:05,816 --> 00:45:07,116
You haven't found it?

858
00:45:07,117 --> 00:45:08,446
I can't find it anywhere.

859
00:45:08,447 --> 00:45:10,834
- Where is Jun Ki? - I don't know.

860
00:45:11,117 --> 00:45:12,955
Did he run away?

861
00:45:12,956 --> 00:45:15,160
Of course. I can't believe that punk.

862
00:45:17,856 --> 00:45:19,455
Guys, I'm home.

863
00:45:19,456 --> 00:45:21,496
What happened? What are you so happy about?

864
00:45:21,796 --> 00:45:23,358
Well, the thing is...

865
00:45:23,697 --> 00:45:27,295
Byung Chul wants me to take charge of his restaurant kitchen.

866
00:45:27,296 --> 00:45:30,571
- What? What are you talking about? - I'll be the main chef.

867
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,776
I finally have my own kitchen.

868
00:45:32,777 --> 00:45:34,469
Really? Congratulations.

869
00:45:34,807 --> 00:45:37,357
Didn't you say you were going to break up with him today?

870
00:45:37,376 --> 00:45:38,468
What?

871
00:45:39,046 --> 00:45:42,035
Well, I gave it some thought.

872
00:45:42,316 --> 00:45:45,386
Fine, he sounds a bit weird when he laughs, sneezes, and hiccups.

873
00:45:45,387 --> 00:45:47,529
But what's the big deal?

874
00:45:47,987 --> 00:45:49,185
It just makes him unique.

875
00:45:49,186 --> 00:45:52,358
My goodness. This morning you couldn't wait to break up with him.

876
00:45:57,226 --> 00:45:58,349
Gosh, I'm tired.

877
00:45:58,726 --> 00:46:00,297
Was the training too hard today?

878
00:46:01,766 --> 00:46:03,643
I hope I'll do well on the test tomorrow.

879
00:46:07,537 --> 00:46:09,720
- Are you okay? - Move!

880
00:46:12,617 --> 00:46:14,045
What's with him?

881
00:46:14,046 --> 00:46:15,168
Thief!

882
00:46:15,376 --> 00:46:17,886
Sir, please catch that thief.

883
00:46:17,887 --> 00:46:19,754
What? A thief?

884
00:46:19,916 --> 00:46:21,008
That punk.

885
00:46:21,117 --> 00:46:23,534
You're dead meat.

886
00:46:34,896 --> 00:46:36,029
Cheers.

887
00:46:39,237 --> 00:46:42,093
All the perverts should go to jail.

888
00:46:42,177 --> 00:46:43,875
That's not enough.

889
00:46:43,876 --> 00:46:46,569
They should all be castrated.

890
00:46:47,217 --> 00:46:49,430
Gosh, this is crazy.

891
00:46:50,046 --> 00:46:52,402
What if I get caught?

892
00:46:52,456 --> 00:46:55,956
Enough of perverts. I'm a little hungry. What about some cup ramyeon?

893
00:46:57,686 --> 00:46:58,809
That sounds good.

894
00:46:59,356 --> 00:47:01,366
Okay. This is my chance.

895
00:47:02,726 --> 00:47:03,787
Let's go.

896
00:47:04,327 --> 00:47:06,234
I have to get out of here immediately.

897
00:47:15,307 --> 00:47:17,754
My gosh. What is it now?

898
00:47:18,206 --> 00:47:21,512
How were you going to get ramyeon with your wallet in your room?

899
00:47:21,976 --> 00:47:23,108
Sorry.

900
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,308
Hi.

901
00:47:26,956 --> 00:47:28,894
- Who are you? - Who are you?

902
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:32,147
Where's my wallet?

903
00:47:32,597 --> 00:47:33,719
Hurry up and find it.

904
00:47:35,427 --> 00:47:37,765
- Who are you? - I'm the owner of this place.

905
00:47:37,766 --> 00:47:39,092
Who are you?

906
00:47:39,896 --> 00:47:41,498
Are you the pervert?

907
00:47:42,037 --> 00:47:44,036
- Lower your voice. - Forget it.

908
00:47:44,037 --> 00:47:45,434
You're the pervert, right?

909
00:47:45,577 --> 00:47:47,906
Be quiet. You'll get both of us in trouble.

910
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:50,150
Why would I get in trouble?

911
00:47:50,606 --> 00:47:53,475
You're a pervert, but I'm just here to find my snake.

912
00:47:53,476 --> 00:47:54,904
To find your snake?

913
00:47:55,947 --> 00:47:57,650
Do you think those girls will buy that?

914
00:47:57,787 --> 00:48:00,015
If we get caught, I'll tell them we were in this together.

915
00:48:00,016 --> 00:48:01,444
- What are you going to do? - "Together"?

916
00:48:02,787 --> 00:48:04,955
What a shameless pervert.

917
00:48:04,956 --> 00:48:06,384
Once we get out of here,

918
00:48:06,757 --> 00:48:08,196
I'll teach you a lesson.

919
00:48:08,197 --> 00:48:09,366
Do whatever you want.

920
00:48:09,367 --> 00:48:10,753
I put it around here.

921
00:48:11,527 --> 00:48:12,536
I found it.

922
00:48:12,537 --> 00:48:14,265
- Shall we go out? - Go out right now.

923
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:17,205
Hey, it's too much hassle. Let's just talk here.

924
00:48:17,206 --> 00:48:18,329
All night.

925
00:48:19,037 --> 00:48:20,127
That sounds good too.

926
00:48:20,307 --> 00:48:22,244
- "All night"? - Hey, where should we go tomorrow?

927
00:48:22,507 --> 00:48:24,210
What other nice places are there?

928
00:48:24,646 --> 00:48:27,176
- Since we went to Myeong-dong, - This is crazy.

929
00:48:27,177 --> 00:48:28,339
why don't we go to Gangnam?

930
00:48:33,057 --> 00:48:34,138
Gosh, you startled me.

931
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:38,427
Ki Bong, you have a test tomorrow. Why are you still up?

932
00:48:38,726 --> 00:48:42,542
Well, I'm too nervous to sleep.

933
00:48:43,367 --> 00:48:46,019
Yu Ri, do you think I can do well?

934
00:48:46,367 --> 00:48:48,070
What if I fail again?

935
00:48:48,737 --> 00:48:51,866
I'm panicking a little about the test.

936
00:48:51,867 --> 00:48:52,957
Hey.

937
00:48:53,777 --> 00:48:55,817
You're a man. Don't be such a crybaby.

938
00:48:56,246 --> 00:48:58,286
You've been working so hard.

939
00:48:58,706 --> 00:49:02,185
I bet you'll make it to the major league this time.

940
00:49:02,447 --> 00:49:03,945
Trust me.

941
00:49:05,046 --> 00:49:06,179
Thanks.

942
00:49:07,217 --> 00:49:09,328
By the way, you didn't break up with Byung Chul?

943
00:49:09,856 --> 00:49:12,713
You'll take charge of his restaurant kitchen?

944
00:49:12,896 --> 00:49:15,866
What? Well...

945
00:49:15,867 --> 00:49:18,988
Don't worry. Congratulations on becoming a chef.

946
00:49:19,867 --> 00:49:21,596
Okay. Thank you.

947
00:49:21,597 --> 00:49:23,136
Thank you.

948
00:49:23,137 --> 00:49:25,736
I won't be taking this test without you.

949
00:49:25,737 --> 00:49:26,798
I'm glad you know that.

950
00:49:27,277 --> 00:49:29,081
So be nice to me.

951
00:49:30,007 --> 00:49:31,230
Fine.

952
00:49:32,206 --> 00:49:35,378
All right. If I start getting paid a lot in the major league,

953
00:49:35,476 --> 00:49:37,384
- I'll buy you a restaurant. - Seriously?

954
00:49:38,686 --> 00:49:40,899
- Is that a promise? - Of course.

955
00:49:41,016 --> 00:49:43,739
I'm a man. I always keep my words.

956
00:49:44,557 --> 00:49:48,024
That chicken place, Yuri's Kitchen, can't cost that much.

957
00:49:49,066 --> 00:49:50,903
You can count on me.

958
00:49:51,796 --> 00:49:54,213
There's one condition. I can eat chicken for free all my life.

959
00:49:55,436 --> 00:49:57,273
Fine. Thank you.

960
00:49:57,706 --> 00:49:59,676
Anyway, go, Kook Ki Bong!

961
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:01,469
Go, Chef Cha!

962
00:50:02,277 --> 00:50:03,368
Let's do this!

963
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,957
- You'll do fine. - Thanks.

964
00:50:15,186 --> 00:50:16,278
Gosh, it hurts.

965
00:50:18,527 --> 00:50:19,895
What are you looking at, pervert?

966
00:50:19,896 --> 00:50:20,977
Look away.

967
00:50:27,537 --> 00:50:28,618
I'm hungry.

968
00:50:34,376 --> 00:50:35,498
A chocolate bar?

969
00:50:35,976 --> 00:50:37,476
What? You want it?

970
00:50:38,007 --> 00:50:39,751
- You want some? - Give me some.

971
00:50:39,876 --> 00:50:41,376
I'm so hungry.

972
00:50:41,577 --> 00:50:43,728
Dream on. It's all mine.

973
00:50:45,686 --> 00:50:48,339
Forget it. You're so petty.

974
00:50:48,487 --> 00:50:49,608
I don't want it anymore.

975
00:50:51,527 --> 00:50:52,618
- Hey. - Leave me alone.

976
00:50:53,557 --> 00:50:54,647
Hey.

977
00:50:55,296 --> 00:50:56,966
What is it now?

978
00:50:56,967 --> 00:50:58,527
Gosh, why are you so sulky?

979
00:51:02,266 --> 00:51:03,328
Here.

980
00:51:07,876 --> 00:51:09,273
You're so mean.

981
00:51:09,976 --> 00:51:11,067
Thanks.

982
00:51:11,807 --> 00:51:14,091
By the way,

983
00:51:14,717 --> 00:51:17,440
don't think I'll let you get away because of this.

984
00:51:17,787 --> 00:51:20,216
- Okay? - Okay. Just eat it.

985
00:51:20,217 --> 00:51:21,379
Fine.

986
00:51:25,287 --> 00:51:27,540
Wait. Why does it taste so good?

987
00:51:27,597 --> 00:51:28,719
Where did you get it?

988
00:51:29,166 --> 00:51:31,596
This? At Itaewon Station, go out Exit Three.

989
00:51:31,597 --> 00:51:33,895
Walk straight for 100m and turn left.

990
00:51:33,896 --> 00:51:36,895
You'll see a shop called "All the Snacks in the World".

991
00:51:38,066 --> 00:51:40,627
If you go out Exit Four at Hapjeong Station...

992
00:51:41,037 --> 00:51:43,006
Ki Bong, good luck with your test today.

993
00:51:43,007 --> 00:51:44,846
You better pass this time.

994
00:51:44,847 --> 00:51:46,204
Fine.

995
00:51:47,016 --> 00:51:49,739
- See you guys later. - Ki Bong.

996
00:51:49,947 --> 00:51:51,037
Take this.

997
00:51:51,146 --> 00:51:52,855
- What's that? - What do you think?

998
00:51:52,856 --> 00:51:55,355
I got up so early to make this.

999
00:51:55,356 --> 00:51:56,886
It's a special energy drink.

1000
00:51:57,126 --> 00:51:59,125
Catch it.

1001
00:52:03,226 --> 00:52:06,196
Hey, you're a pitcher. How could you fail to catch it?

1002
00:52:06,197 --> 00:52:07,930
It was just a mistake.

1003
00:52:12,637 --> 00:52:13,901
What's wrong?

1004
00:52:15,606 --> 00:52:16,728
Nothing.

1005
00:52:18,007 --> 00:52:20,145
- See you. - Good luck.

1006
00:52:20,146 --> 00:52:21,245
- Good luck. - You can do this.

1007
00:52:21,246 --> 00:52:22,337
Thanks.

1008
00:52:24,746 --> 00:52:26,623
- Let's do this! - Let's do this!

1009
00:52:29,686 --> 00:52:30,778
Good luck!

1010
00:52:31,327 --> 00:52:32,622
I really hope he'll pass.

1011
00:52:33,657 --> 00:52:37,134
By the way, Jun Ki didn't come home last night. Where is he?

1012
00:52:40,637 --> 00:52:42,575
Wait, the sun is already up.

1013
00:52:43,137 --> 00:52:44,366
That's right.

1014
00:52:44,367 --> 00:52:46,306
- It was so nice... - Gosh, my arm.

1015
00:52:46,307 --> 00:52:48,041
listening to music and talking to you all night.

1016
00:52:48,177 --> 00:52:49,227
Right.

1017
00:52:49,476 --> 00:52:50,776
What song do you want to listen to now?

1018
00:52:50,777 --> 00:52:51,868
Again?

1019
00:52:52,376 --> 00:52:56,629
- How can they talk so long? - Exactly.

1020
00:52:57,046 --> 00:52:59,536
How can they never stop talking?

1021
00:53:02,987 --> 00:53:04,426
I know this song.

1022
00:53:04,427 --> 00:53:05,826
They're hopeless.

1023
00:53:05,827 --> 00:53:07,656
It's obviously "Once Upon a Day" by Kim Bum Soo.

1024
00:53:07,657 --> 00:53:08,982
- Right? - No, it's not.

1025
00:53:09,697 --> 00:53:10,850
It's that song.

1026
00:53:11,197 --> 00:53:13,307
"Don't Worry" by Jeon In Kwon.

1027
00:53:13,836 --> 00:53:15,736
No, it's not. It's "Once Upon a Day" by Kim Bum Soo.

1028
00:53:15,737 --> 00:53:17,542
No, it's not. It's Jeon In Kwon...

1029
00:53:19,336 --> 00:53:21,448
Fine. Do you want a make a bet?

1030
00:53:21,577 --> 00:53:23,105
The winner flicks the loser on the forehead.

1031
00:53:23,106 --> 00:53:24,605
- What do you say? Deal? - Deal.

1032
00:53:24,606 --> 00:53:25,800
I know it.

1033
00:53:26,177 --> 00:53:27,951
"Don't Worry" by Jeon In Kwon.

1034
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,446
That's right.

1035
00:53:29,447 --> 00:53:31,834
Okay! See? I was right.

1036
00:53:31,887 --> 00:53:33,957
Give me your forehead.

1037
00:53:34,356 --> 00:53:35,988
Gosh, this is crazy.

1038
00:53:36,057 --> 00:53:38,756
- Please don't flick too hard. - Forget it.

1039
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:40,185
I'll flick really hard.

1040
00:53:41,356 --> 00:53:42,550
Come here.

1041
00:53:44,197 --> 00:53:46,379
- Come closer. - No.

1042
00:53:53,037 --> 00:53:55,306
What was that? Why did you flick so lightly?

1043
00:53:55,307 --> 00:53:58,367
You shared your chocolate bar with me.

1044
00:53:59,316 --> 00:54:00,438
Thanks.

1045
00:54:00,847 --> 00:54:03,467
Don't mention it. It's nothing.

1046
00:54:07,316 --> 00:54:10,243
(Kook Ki Bong)

1047
00:54:11,356 --> 00:54:13,295
(Kook Ki Bong)

1048
00:54:14,027 --> 00:54:16,765
Last time, you failed him...

1049
00:54:16,766 --> 00:54:18,021
- in the last minute. - I see.

1050
00:54:26,537 --> 00:54:28,108
What was that?

1051
00:54:28,507 --> 00:54:30,240
Well...

1052
00:54:31,876 --> 00:54:35,109
He must be a little nervous.

1053
00:54:36,746 --> 00:54:38,725
Hey! Pull yourself together!

1054
00:54:39,887 --> 00:54:41,447
I'm sorry. Let me try again.

1055
00:54:54,836 --> 00:54:57,081
What happened? What's wrong?

1056
00:54:57,637 --> 00:54:59,197
I'm sorry.

1057
00:55:01,706 --> 00:55:04,603
Hey, what's wrong? What happened to your shoulder?

1058
00:55:05,307 --> 00:55:07,560
- Are you injured? - Pardon?

1059
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:10,121
No, I'm not injured.

1060
00:55:21,226 --> 00:55:22,686
Are you really okay?

1061
00:55:23,566 --> 00:55:25,943
Yes, I'm okay.

1062
00:55:27,566 --> 00:55:28,720
I'm totally fine.

1063
00:55:29,407 --> 00:55:30,560
I'll try it again.

1064
00:55:30,967 --> 00:55:31,987
Okay.

1065
00:55:38,646 --> 00:55:40,015
What's the matter?

1066
00:55:40,016 --> 00:55:41,645
You're not fine at all.

1067
00:55:41,646 --> 00:55:43,656
Get up right now. Let's go to the hospital.

1068
00:55:44,787 --> 00:55:47,234
No, Coach. I'm fine.

1069
00:55:47,657 --> 00:55:50,207
I can do it. I can really do this.

1070
00:55:50,487 --> 00:55:51,915
I can really do this!

1071
00:56:04,737 --> 00:56:06,308
What's wrong? Are you sick?

1072
00:56:06,436 --> 00:56:08,736
No, I'm okay.

1073
00:56:08,737 --> 00:56:11,562
You don't look okay. Look at all this cold sweat.

1074
00:56:13,476 --> 00:56:14,599
Actually...

1075
00:56:18,117 --> 00:56:19,756
I want to pee so badly.

1076
00:56:19,757 --> 00:56:22,266
- What? - Don't mind me.

1077
00:56:22,617 --> 00:56:25,075
I can hold it in. I'm an expert at that.

1078
00:56:28,157 --> 00:56:30,411
This looks bad. Hang in there a little longer.

1079
00:56:30,496 --> 00:56:32,366
Why? What are you going to do?

1080
00:56:32,367 --> 00:56:34,995
I can't see you suffering like this any longer!

1081
00:56:34,996 --> 00:56:37,148
- What? - So just hang in there.

1082
00:56:51,316 --> 00:56:53,560
That scared me. What was that sound?

1083
00:56:56,327 --> 00:56:57,377
That's strange.

1084
00:56:58,157 --> 00:56:59,256
It's probably nothing.

1085
00:56:59,257 --> 00:57:00,317
Here.

1086
00:57:02,356 --> 00:57:03,519
Thank you.

1087
00:57:03,827 --> 00:57:06,236
You shouldn't have taken such a risk.

1088
00:57:06,237 --> 00:57:07,565
You said it was an emergency!

1089
00:57:07,566 --> 00:57:10,157
I can't believe you. You're amazing.

1090
00:57:21,447 --> 00:57:22,467
Pervert!

1091
00:57:27,086 --> 00:57:29,198
Why? Why did you do it?

1092
00:57:30,126 --> 00:57:32,575
Why did you let it bite you instead of me?

1093
00:57:33,527 --> 00:57:36,485
When you flicked me on the forehead, you went easy on me.

1094
00:57:36,566 --> 00:57:37,618
What?

1095
00:57:38,226 --> 00:57:39,795
Is that the only reason?

1096
00:57:39,796 --> 00:57:41,196
And you said you're an actor.

1097
00:57:41,197 --> 00:57:42,665
Actors live off their faces.

1098
00:57:42,666 --> 00:57:44,952
Now is not the time to think of me!

1099
00:57:45,737 --> 00:57:48,429
Look at how swollen your lips are.

1100
00:57:48,606 --> 00:57:50,475
You're breaking my heart.

1101
00:57:50,476 --> 00:57:53,883
It's okay. I'll receive treatment in jail.

1102
00:57:54,016 --> 00:57:55,403
Anyway, thanks.

1103
00:57:57,287 --> 00:58:01,437
Still, the crime you committed is unacceptable,

1104
00:58:01,657 --> 00:58:03,390
and it must not be forgiven.

1105
00:58:04,157 --> 00:58:07,869
Pay for your sins, and don't ever do anything like that again.

1106
00:58:10,166 --> 00:58:11,452
Can you promise me?

1107
00:58:24,777 --> 00:58:28,347
I think we're done talking here. Let's go now.

1108
00:58:31,987 --> 00:58:33,140
I'll go visit you.

1109
00:58:33,887 --> 00:58:35,855
Call me when you're released.

1110
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:37,477
Okay?

1111
00:58:38,827 --> 00:58:39,847
What are you doing?

1112
00:58:40,057 --> 00:58:42,066
Did you grow on that jerk of a pervert or what?

1113
00:58:42,226 --> 00:58:44,164
What? Jerk?

1114
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:49,425
Hey, he's the most loyal guy I've ever met.

1115
00:58:49,836 --> 00:58:50,856
You don't know anything!

1116
00:58:57,146 --> 00:59:00,003
He's insane. He has totally lost his mind.

1117
00:59:00,246 --> 00:59:01,949
Ki Bong, you're home.

1118
00:59:02,177 --> 00:59:03,267
How did your test...

1119
00:59:03,947 --> 00:59:05,008
What's wrong with your arm?

1120
00:59:06,046 --> 00:59:07,085
I got injured.

1121
00:59:07,086 --> 00:59:08,455
What? Injured?

1122
00:59:08,456 --> 00:59:11,179
Where? What about your test?

1123
00:59:11,927 --> 00:59:15,017
I'm sorry, but I'm tired, so I'll go get some rest.

1124
00:59:37,765 --> 00:59:41,376
Hey. You should be resting. What are you here for?

1125
00:59:42,805 --> 00:59:44,540
Coach wanted to see me.

1126
00:59:44,605 --> 00:59:45,900
Oh, I see.

1127
00:59:46,676 --> 00:59:49,784
Hey. I went through so much trouble to teach you the forkball,

1128
00:59:49,785 --> 00:59:51,315
but how could you end up like that?

1129
00:59:53,355 --> 00:59:56,212
I just wasted my time. How pathetic.

1130
00:59:57,825 --> 00:59:58,845
Ki Bong.

1131
00:59:59,725 --> 01:00:00,817
Yes, Coach.

1132
01:00:16,506 --> 01:00:17,627
My back hurts.

1133
01:00:18,245 --> 01:00:21,132
I've been cleaning all day, and my body is aching all over.

1134
01:00:24,285 --> 01:00:26,733
Will this really be my kitchen?

1135
01:00:28,915 --> 01:00:29,976
This feels so nice.

1136
01:00:31,156 --> 01:00:32,224
Yu Ri.

1137
01:00:32,225 --> 01:00:33,480
Hi, Byung Chul.

1138
01:00:34,096 --> 01:00:36,716
Sorry for being late. My training took longer than I thought.

1139
01:00:38,725 --> 01:00:40,327
This place is so spick-and-span.

1140
01:00:40,736 --> 01:00:42,327
Did you clean on your own?

1141
01:00:42,696 --> 01:00:43,757
Yes.

1142
01:00:44,866 --> 01:00:47,354
By the way, what happened to Ki Bong?

1143
01:00:47,506 --> 01:00:49,311
The test results aren't out yet?

1144
01:00:50,375 --> 01:00:52,619
You haven't heard the news yet, have you?

1145
01:00:53,245 --> 01:00:54,847
Ki Bong was kicked out today.

1146
01:00:54,975 --> 01:00:55,995
What?

1147
01:00:57,185 --> 01:00:58,440
Kicked out?

1148
01:00:58,486 --> 01:01:00,118
The test results came out,

1149
01:01:00,256 --> 01:01:02,806
and his previous injury has recurred.

1150
01:01:03,256 --> 01:01:06,927
How could a professional be so bad at taking care of his body?

1151
01:01:07,096 --> 01:01:10,023
He dug his own grave. How stupid.

1152
01:01:11,165 --> 01:01:12,394
He has no choice.

1153
01:01:12,395 --> 01:01:14,365
It will take years for rehabilitation,

1154
01:01:14,366 --> 01:01:17,065
and even if that goes well, there's no guarantee he'll fully recover.

1155
01:01:17,066 --> 01:01:19,789
But there's no way the team will wait for that long.

1156
01:01:19,805 --> 01:01:21,610
He's too ambitious for his own good.

1157
01:01:21,736 --> 01:01:24,530
The major league? That fool should really know his place.

1158
01:01:25,245 --> 01:01:26,602
What did you just say?

1159
01:01:27,645 --> 01:01:29,482
- What? - A fool?

1160
01:01:30,586 --> 01:01:31,912
What do you know?

1161
01:01:32,546 --> 01:01:35,238
What do you know about Ki Bong to say things like that?

1162
01:01:36,156 --> 01:01:38,808
Do you even know how hard he tried...

1163
01:01:39,156 --> 01:01:40,255
all this time?

1164
01:01:40,256 --> 01:01:43,428
He never missed a single day all year long...

1165
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:45,741
and went to train at five in the morning.

1166
01:01:45,825 --> 01:01:48,664
And he might not be able to play baseball ever again.

1167
01:01:48,665 --> 01:01:49,819
How could you say something like that?

1168
01:01:49,966 --> 01:01:51,974
How could you call yourself his teammate? You jerk.

1169
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:59,126
Don't ever call me again. Got it?

1170
01:02:13,426 --> 01:02:15,231
I'm being kicked out?

1171
01:02:15,455 --> 01:02:16,894
What are you talking about?

1172
01:02:16,895 --> 01:02:17,987
I'm sorry.

1173
01:02:18,096 --> 01:02:21,328
It's the team's decision, and there's nothing I can do about it.

1174
01:02:22,696 --> 01:02:25,389
Coach, please give me one more chance.

1175
01:02:25,636 --> 01:02:27,934
After 솓 rehabilitation, I can pitch again.

1176
01:02:27,935 --> 01:02:29,567
I can really do better, Coach.

1177
01:02:31,346 --> 01:02:34,885
I'm begging you, Coach. Please. Please?

1178
01:02:35,875 --> 01:02:38,671
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1179
01:03:02,506 --> 01:03:03,596
What are you doing here?

1180
01:03:05,846 --> 01:03:07,100
I was just sitting here.

1181
01:03:07,415 --> 01:03:08,467
Really?

1182
01:03:15,256 --> 01:03:16,306
But...

1183
01:03:17,555 --> 01:03:18,684
Are you okay?

1184
01:03:18,685 --> 01:03:19,746
What?

1185
01:03:20,656 --> 01:03:21,746
Why?

1186
01:03:22,696 --> 01:03:24,053
I heard the news.

1187
01:03:24,966 --> 01:03:25,986
That you...

1188
01:03:27,196 --> 01:03:28,465
were kicked out of the team.

1189
01:03:28,466 --> 01:03:30,138
Oh, that.

1190
01:03:32,066 --> 01:03:33,330
You heard too?

1191
01:03:35,276 --> 01:03:36,499
There's nothing I can do.

1192
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:39,252
Rehabilitation will be too difficult, and a waste of time.

1193
01:03:39,645 --> 01:03:41,042
It turned out better this way.

1194
01:03:41,676 --> 01:03:43,991
I was getting sick of playing baseball anyway.

1195
01:03:44,785 --> 01:03:46,213
It's about time I stop.

1196
01:03:48,555 --> 01:03:50,360
- Are you serious? - What?

1197
01:03:52,386 --> 01:03:53,447
Of course.

1198
01:03:54,526 --> 01:03:57,586
I'm really fine, so don't worry about me.

1199
01:04:03,765 --> 01:04:04,958
Hey, Ki Bong.

1200
01:04:07,035 --> 01:04:08,126
Look at me.

1201
01:04:09,506 --> 01:04:10,934
What? Why?

1202
01:04:14,676 --> 01:04:16,885
Gosh, what was that about?

1203
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:18,272
If you want to cry, just go ahead and cry.

1204
01:04:19,046 --> 01:04:20,647
Don't hold it all in like an idiot.

1205
01:04:38,305 --> 01:04:39,387
Yu Ri.

1206
01:04:41,205 --> 01:04:42,430
What should I do?

1207
01:04:45,676 --> 01:04:47,276
I can't play baseball anymore.

1208
01:04:50,515 --> 01:04:52,352
I'll never be able to play it again.

1209
01:04:57,355 --> 01:04:59,019
How am I going to live from now on?

1210
01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:02,799
What do I do?

1211
01:05:04,426 --> 01:05:07,863
What should I do now?

1212
01:05:34,355 --> 01:05:37,018
(Welcome to Waikiki 2 / Eulachacha Waikiki 2)

1213
01:05:37,895 --> 01:05:39,724
I'll lift Ki Bong's spirits.

1214
01:05:39,725 --> 01:05:40,795
Just trust me, okay?

1215
01:05:40,796 --> 01:05:43,195
How can this chocolate make him feel better?

1216
01:05:43,196 --> 01:05:44,804
Do you think he's a complete idiot or what?

1217
01:05:44,805 --> 01:05:46,702
I'm craving it. I want it so badly.

1218
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,509
Where did you buy that chocolate?

1219
01:05:48,535 --> 01:05:49,934
Just tell me the name!

1220
01:05:49,935 --> 01:05:51,804
What's the occasion? Why is the event taking place here?

1221
01:05:51,805 --> 01:05:53,545
It's our boss' wife's birthday today.

1222
01:05:53,546 --> 01:05:55,474
Boss, the singer is here!

1223
01:05:55,475 --> 01:05:57,383
- Are you Woo Shik? - Mi Young?

1224
01:05:57,846 --> 01:05:59,284
If she looks for me, tell her I'm not here.

1225
01:05:59,285 --> 01:06:00,755
Tell her I moved to another country, okay?

1226
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:02,655
It's hosted by the anchor, Jo Sang Hwa, right?

1227
01:06:02,656 --> 01:06:04,124
I'm a huge fan of his.

1228
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:06,155
Then why don't you try hitting on him?

1229
01:06:06,156 --> 01:06:08,624
- Shall we go for a drive tomorrow? - Pardon me?

1230
01:06:08,625 --> 01:06:09,994
She should be careful.

1231
01:06:09,995 --> 01:06:11,894
He takes girls to his vacation villa...

1232
01:06:11,895 --> 01:06:13,664
and ghosts them after having fun with them just once.

1233
01:06:13,665 --> 01:06:15,532
Darn it. Kim Jung Eun!
