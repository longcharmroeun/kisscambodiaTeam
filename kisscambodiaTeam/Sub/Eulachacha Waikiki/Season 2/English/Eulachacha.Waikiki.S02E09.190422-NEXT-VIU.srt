1
00:00:19,837 --> 00:00:21,469
There we go.

2
00:00:26,807 --> 00:00:29,091
What are you doing? Aren't you getting out?

3
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,692
Sure, of course.

4
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:38,109
Were you shocked?

5
00:00:38,826 --> 00:00:42,263
Don't worry about it and just sleep on it for today.

6
00:00:43,256 --> 00:00:44,347
Okay?

7
00:00:44,597 --> 00:00:45,994
Yes. Okay.

8
00:00:47,626 --> 00:00:48,688
Let's go inside.

9
00:00:57,076 --> 00:00:58,158
Let go of her!

10
00:00:59,847 --> 00:01:00,927
Jun Ki?

11
00:01:02,747 --> 00:01:04,582
Jung Eun, are you all right?

12
00:01:04,917 --> 00:01:06,477
Did you get hurt?

13
00:01:07,386 --> 00:01:09,457
Why do you worry me like that?

14
00:01:09,616 --> 00:01:10,738
Let's go, Jung Eun.

15
00:01:23,897 --> 00:01:26,517
Hey, Jun Ki. I heard you disappeared in the middle of the shoot.

16
00:01:26,866 --> 00:01:27,958
What happened?

17
00:01:28,537 --> 00:01:31,055
Something came up.

18
00:01:31,506 --> 00:01:32,568
What?

19
00:01:32,707 --> 00:01:35,046
Why are you so curious?

20
00:01:35,047 --> 00:01:36,067
Mind your own business!

21
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:39,579
What are you going to do? The producer seemed outraged.

22
00:01:39,647 --> 00:01:42,308
I just got a call from the staff. I got fired.

23
00:01:42,957 --> 00:01:44,656
Didn't you attend the shoot in my place today?

24
00:01:44,657 --> 00:01:46,885
She said you were so good that she wants to recommend you to others.

25
00:01:46,886 --> 00:01:47,948
What?

26
00:01:48,427 --> 00:01:50,671
Oh, it turned out that way.

27
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:52,926
What are you going to do?

28
00:01:52,927 --> 00:01:54,221
It's all right.

29
00:01:54,627 --> 00:01:56,636
It didn't suit me anyway.

30
00:01:56,897 --> 00:02:00,435
I think I'm more of an actor than a reporter.

31
00:02:00,606 --> 00:02:01,626
Actor.

32
00:02:03,276 --> 00:02:05,676
So don't worry about me and keep it up.

33
00:02:05,677 --> 00:02:08,227
- All right. Thanks, Jun Ki. - Sure.

34
00:02:12,647 --> 00:02:13,916
What was that?

35
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:17,185
Jung Eun's been at it for a while, saying she's got a lot on her mind.

36
00:02:17,186 --> 00:02:18,237
What do you mean?

37
00:02:23,496 --> 00:02:24,649
I can't believe it.

38
00:02:25,526 --> 00:02:27,710
Does this mean I've fallen for Jun Ki?

39
00:02:28,996 --> 00:02:30,016
No.

40
00:02:30,536 --> 00:02:32,066
There's no way.

41
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:34,502
It can't be it.

42
00:02:40,806 --> 00:02:46,702
(Everything About My Male Friend)

43
00:02:48,556 --> 00:02:49,781
It doesn't make sense.

44
00:02:50,816 --> 00:02:52,010
Why would I?

45
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:14,921
I guess he's not that bad now that I take a look.

46
00:03:18,517 --> 00:03:20,486
What is he working so hard on?

47
00:03:22,957 --> 00:03:25,098
A phone call? Who could it be?

48
00:03:30,496 --> 00:03:31,854
Is this Kook Ki Bong?

49
00:03:32,096 --> 00:03:33,729
This is Good Morning Bank.

50
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:36,750
Your credit card has been hacked.

51
00:03:37,596 --> 00:03:38,963
No need to panic.

52
00:03:39,207 --> 00:03:40,865
In order to fix it,

53
00:03:40,866 --> 00:03:42,636
you should immediately wire 50 dollars...

54
00:03:42,637 --> 00:03:45,206
to your friend, Lee Jun Ki.

55
00:03:45,207 --> 00:03:46,940
He was prank-calling?

56
00:03:47,246 --> 00:03:48,946
Yes, all right. Good bye.

57
00:03:48,947 --> 00:03:50,446
With even a script?

58
00:03:52,346 --> 00:03:54,386
What an idiot.

59
00:03:56,286 --> 00:03:57,745
I should've guessed.

60
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:04,177
Hello?

61
00:04:04,227 --> 00:04:05,595
Is this Kim Jung Eun?

62
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:07,326
This is Good Morning Bank.

63
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:09,029
Your credit card has been...

64
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:11,682
Hello? Hello...

65
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,468
I must be out of my mind.

66
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:17,660
Where are you going?

67
00:04:18,307 --> 00:04:20,675
I just got a call from Good Morning Bank.

68
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:21,946
My credit card's been hacked,

69
00:04:21,947 --> 00:04:23,681
so I need to wire Jun Ki 50 dollars.

70
00:04:23,716 --> 00:04:24,839
So I'm headed to the bank.

71
00:04:24,976 --> 00:04:26,211
Ki Bong, forget it.

72
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:27,744
What? Why?

73
00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:29,256
Just forget it!

74
00:04:29,257 --> 00:04:31,855
I got the phone call too, and they said they were able to stop it.

75
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:33,152
- Really? - Yes.

76
00:04:33,526 --> 00:04:34,986
What a relief!

77
00:04:34,986 --> 00:04:36,761
I was so worried!

78
00:04:37,156 --> 00:04:39,573
Are you naive or stupid?

79
00:04:39,827 --> 00:04:40,847
Hey.

80
00:04:40,966 --> 00:04:42,803
Who are you calling stupid?

81
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:43,996
I'm not stupid!

82
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:45,638
Who does she think I am?

83
00:04:45,707 --> 00:04:47,166
That was a good sleep.

84
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:51,410
Have you been sleeping all this time?

85
00:04:51,676 --> 00:04:53,876
Yes. I stayed up all night searching...

86
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,576
for the things I'll be able to get from the government...

87
00:04:56,577 --> 00:04:58,148
once I open Yu Ri's Kitchen.

88
00:04:58,817 --> 00:05:00,746
Oh, right. I need to write up a resume.

89
00:05:00,747 --> 00:05:01,910
Can I borrow your laptop?

90
00:05:01,986 --> 00:05:03,108
What resume?

91
00:05:03,557 --> 00:05:04,811
What are you talking about, all of a sudden?

92
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,008
I'm going to get a job.

93
00:05:06,187 --> 00:05:08,855
My friend's going to set me up with a job as a car dealer.

94
00:05:08,856 --> 00:05:11,725
So he told me to send in a resume and cover letter.

95
00:05:11,726 --> 00:05:13,022
A car dealer?

96
00:05:13,026 --> 00:05:14,046
Yes.

97
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:17,835
To be honest, I've always loved cars.

98
00:05:17,836 --> 00:05:20,457
So I want to try working as a car dealer.

99
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:22,528
Is that so?

100
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,221
What about writing poems? You said you wanted to be a poet.

101
00:05:25,346 --> 00:05:26,427
The thing is...

102
00:05:26,947 --> 00:05:29,497
The pains of creativity were too harsh on me.

103
00:05:29,776 --> 00:05:31,215
Pains of creativity?

104
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:32,236
Yes.

105
00:05:32,887 --> 00:05:34,040
You wouldn't know...

106
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:36,452
how agonizing it is.

107
00:05:38,017 --> 00:05:41,189
Growl, growl, growl...

108
00:05:45,897 --> 00:05:47,396
He must have lost his mind.

109
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,429
Gosh. Isn't he too old to be prank-calling?

110
00:05:55,776 --> 00:05:57,613
Why would I fall for someone like him?

111
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,985
What's up with him?

112
00:06:08,986 --> 00:06:10,925
Why is he cleaning when he wasn't even told to?

113
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:17,969
Right. He can be a slacker, but he's quite responsible...

114
00:06:21,127 --> 00:06:23,310
What? Is he stealing money?

115
00:06:24,497 --> 00:06:25,660
I did it!

116
00:06:32,747 --> 00:06:33,971
Is he regretting what he just did?

117
00:06:40,486 --> 00:06:41,772
Is he feeling guilty?

118
00:06:45,856 --> 00:06:48,335
What? Why is he wiping it with tissue?

119
00:06:48,687 --> 00:06:49,818
Could he be...

120
00:06:50,856 --> 00:06:52,397
I almost left my fingerprints on it.

121
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:53,947
Now, it's all good!

122
00:06:54,397 --> 00:06:57,559
I knew it. I'm an idiot for hoping that he'd feel guilty.

123
00:07:02,937 --> 00:07:04,711
So you've never worked as a reporter before?

124
00:07:04,807 --> 00:07:06,475
That's right. It's my first time.

125
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:07,873
Then where did you work?

126
00:07:08,707 --> 00:07:11,603
I modeled and worked as a server at a cafe part-time.

127
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:15,845
- What about a full-time job? - I've never had any.

128
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:20,098
I know I don't have much experience, but I can be a great reporter.

129
00:07:20,627 --> 00:07:23,616
When I set my mind to something, I always do my best.

130
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:25,283
I'm sorry,

131
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:28,682
- but I don't think we can hire you. - Pardon me?

132
00:07:30,336 --> 00:07:31,520
Well, why is that?

133
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:35,266
Is it because I'm not as experienced as other people are?

134
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:38,091
- Do you think that's the reason? - Then what's the reason?

135
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:40,675
Please tell me.

136
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:42,278
It should be pronounced as, "Please tell me."

137
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,975
- I beg your pardon? - You did it again.

138
00:07:44,976 --> 00:07:47,058
"I beg your pardon?" It should be pronounced like that.

139
00:07:47,786 --> 00:07:49,622
- Sorry? - You still don't get it?

140
00:07:49,856 --> 00:07:52,456
A reporter must deliver accurate information...

141
00:07:52,457 --> 00:07:55,007
to the viewers in a precise manner. And in order to do that,

142
00:07:55,286 --> 00:07:57,164
having good diction is a must.

143
00:07:58,827 --> 00:08:00,254
Do I need to tell you other reasons?

144
00:08:01,726 --> 00:08:02,858
Please leave.

145
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:09,859
What? You didn't get the job?

146
00:08:10,437 --> 00:08:13,507
- Why? - Reporters must have good diction.

147
00:08:13,546 --> 00:08:15,376
He said he can't work with me because I don't even have...

148
00:08:15,377 --> 00:08:16,672
that basic qualification.

149
00:08:17,216 --> 00:08:18,369
Really?

150
00:08:19,117 --> 00:08:21,768
Don't be too disappointed. You can find another job.

151
00:08:22,356 --> 00:08:24,886
What do you mean? I haven't given up yet.

152
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:26,686
What? Then what will you do?

153
00:08:26,687 --> 00:08:28,727
I'll practice hard and go back for another interview.

154
00:08:29,197 --> 00:08:32,053
I'll show him that I can accomplish anything I put my mind to.

155
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:34,958
You sound very determined.

156
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:40,115
I don't think I'll be able to do anything if I give up again.

157
00:08:40,837 --> 00:08:43,305
I must get this job and become successful...

158
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:44,908
so that I can get our house back...

159
00:08:45,036 --> 00:08:47,117
and pay off my dad's debt for him.

160
00:08:49,117 --> 00:08:50,749
All right. Cheer up.

161
00:08:51,676 --> 00:08:52,768
Thanks.

162
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:55,071
By the way, Woo Shik,

163
00:08:55,517 --> 00:08:58,749
one more hotteok will totally cheer me up.

164
00:09:02,857 --> 00:09:07,109
I'm back!

165
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:09,020
That was so loud!

166
00:09:09,097 --> 00:09:10,668
You startled me.

167
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,465
By the way, what's that megaphone for?

168
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:16,393
Oh, this? I bought it because I need it for something.

169
00:09:17,237 --> 00:09:18,939
He bought a megaphone with the money he stole?

170
00:09:19,347 --> 00:09:20,978
What are you going to do this time?

171
00:09:22,147 --> 00:09:24,084
Some money is missing from the cash register.

172
00:09:24,776 --> 00:09:25,939
It was your doing, right?

173
00:09:28,446 --> 00:09:30,586
No, I didn't even go anywhere near the cash register.

174
00:09:30,587 --> 00:09:31,810
What a liar.

175
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,048
We're back!

176
00:09:34,456 --> 00:09:37,415
Why are you so late?

177
00:09:37,526 --> 00:09:38,649
Gosh, you startled me.

178
00:09:38,826 --> 00:09:40,560
You punk, what are you doing?

179
00:09:40,926 --> 00:09:43,588
Just leave him be. Who knows what he's thinking?

180
00:09:43,997 --> 00:09:46,606
Jun Ki, do you know any reporters?

181
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:49,462
I need to improve my diction, but I have no idea how.

182
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:52,504
Why do you need to improve your diction?

183
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:55,008
For a reporter job I've applied to.

184
00:09:55,717 --> 00:09:57,205
I do know one personally.

185
00:09:57,276 --> 00:09:59,123
She's a reporter as well as a speech instructor.

186
00:09:59,747 --> 00:10:02,612
Seriously? Then put me in touch with her, please?

187
00:10:02,786 --> 00:10:05,133
(Hey You Too Speech Academy)

188
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:10,282
Hello.

189
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,025
Oh, who are you?

190
00:10:12,026 --> 00:10:13,964
Jun Ki sent me here.

191
00:10:15,227 --> 00:10:16,562
You're Han Soo Yeon, right?

192
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:19,585
- You want to improve your diction? - Yes.

193
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:21,606
My diction isn't good.

194
00:10:21,607 --> 00:10:23,106
You don't need to worry about that.

195
00:10:23,107 --> 00:10:25,248
I'm an expert in this area.

196
00:10:25,576 --> 00:10:27,178
Well, shall we get started right away?

197
00:10:27,706 --> 00:10:28,828
Sure.

198
00:10:31,576 --> 00:10:34,678
You can just repeat after me.

199
00:10:34,747 --> 00:10:35,879
Flex your core.

200
00:10:36,587 --> 00:10:37,882
And relax your shoulders.

201
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:39,790
Open your mouth as wide as you can.

202
00:10:40,326 --> 00:10:41,989
Nice, that's great.

203
00:10:42,186 --> 00:10:44,543
- Be confident, okay? - Okay.

204
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,896
Pay attention to the shape of my mouth...

205
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,559
and repeat after me.

206
00:10:49,936 --> 00:10:52,266
Ga, gya, geo, gyeo,

207
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:55,405
go, gyo, gu, gyu, geu, gi.

208
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:57,535
Ga, gya, geo, gyeo,

209
00:10:57,536 --> 00:11:00,675
go, gyo, gu, gyu, geu, gi.

210
00:11:00,676 --> 00:11:01,829
That was great.

211
00:11:01,906 --> 00:11:04,221
Let's move on to the next consonant.

212
00:11:05,076 --> 00:11:07,246
Da, dya, deo, dyeo,

213
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:10,377
do, dyo, du, dyu, deu, di.

214
00:11:11,786 --> 00:11:14,425
Hold on. What's wrong?

215
00:11:14,426 --> 00:11:16,996
Pardon? Oh, it's just...

216
00:11:16,997 --> 00:11:19,496
This is a serious class.

217
00:11:19,497 --> 00:11:21,975
Why do you keep blinking?

218
00:11:22,127 --> 00:11:24,074
Focus, please. I need your full attention.

219
00:11:24,897 --> 00:11:27,487
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

220
00:11:30,137 --> 00:11:33,705
All right, on to the next consonant.

221
00:11:33,706 --> 00:11:36,837
Carefully study the shape of my mouth and repeat after me.

222
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:40,016
Cha, chya, cheo, chyeo, cho, chyo,

223
00:11:40,017 --> 00:11:43,117
- chu, chyu, cheu, chi. - Gosh, this is too much saliva.

224
00:11:43,156 --> 00:11:46,491
You're doing that again. What is the problem?

225
00:11:46,526 --> 00:11:47,782
It's just that...

226
00:11:48,686 --> 00:11:51,511
I can't complain because she's teaching me for free.

227
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:56,550
It's just because my vision is blurry.

228
00:11:57,566 --> 00:11:58,658
My apologies.

229
00:11:58,837 --> 00:12:01,665
Cha, chya, cheo, chyeo, cho...

230
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:04,705
Cha, chya, chu, chyu, cheu, chi.

231
00:12:04,706 --> 00:12:05,746
Now, we'll do "k".

232
00:12:05,747 --> 00:12:08,909
Ka, kya, keo, kyeo, ko, kyo, ku...

233
00:12:09,117 --> 00:12:10,299
"K" is a bit better.

234
00:12:10,517 --> 00:12:11,616
Moving on to "t".

235
00:12:11,617 --> 00:12:14,716
Ta, tya, teo, tyeo, to, tyo,

236
00:12:14,717 --> 00:12:17,134
tu, tyu, teu, ti.

237
00:12:18,186 --> 00:12:20,455
What are you waiting for? Repeat after me.

238
00:12:20,456 --> 00:12:21,578
Sorry?

239
00:12:22,257 --> 00:12:23,379
Okay.

240
00:12:24,056 --> 00:12:26,366
Ta, tya, teo, tyeo,

241
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:29,560
to, tyo, tu, tyu, teu, ti.

242
00:12:30,897 --> 00:12:32,195
Why? What's wrong?

243
00:12:32,196 --> 00:12:34,481
Everything sounds perfect,

244
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,428
except for the way you pronounce "tu".

245
00:12:40,446 --> 00:12:43,303
Pay attention to the shape of my mouth and repeat after me.

246
00:12:44,217 --> 00:12:45,370
Tu.

247
00:12:46,946 --> 00:12:49,516
What are you waiting for? Repeat after me!

248
00:12:49,517 --> 00:12:51,659
Sorry? Oh, okay.

249
00:12:54,326 --> 00:12:57,386
- Tu. - No, you're not getting it.

250
00:12:57,757 --> 00:12:58,879
Tu.

251
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:04,505
- Tu. - That's not how you do it.

252
00:13:05,066 --> 00:13:07,836
The tip of your tongue should touch the back of your lower front teeth.

253
00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:09,091
Then as if you're flicking your tongue...

254
00:13:09,306 --> 00:13:11,786
Tu.

255
00:13:18,176 --> 00:13:19,339
Tu.

256
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,773
Stop wiping your face. What if you end up scratching your skin?

257
00:13:27,826 --> 00:13:30,040
I feel like I can still smell her saliva.

258
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,356
She sprayed almost a liter of saliva on my face today.

259
00:13:32,357 --> 00:13:33,665
That much saliva?

260
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,366
It wasn't casual spraying of saliva. She practically spat on me.

261
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:38,035
Especially when she was saying "tu",

262
00:13:38,036 --> 00:13:40,556
I could clearly see her saliva flying toward my face.

263
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:43,591
Gosh, it's so gross. I should take a shower.

264
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,595
Yu Ri, thanks for lending me your laptop.

265
00:13:49,816 --> 00:13:52,194
No problem. Did you write your resume?

266
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:54,490
Yes. Ta-da!

267
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:56,901
- Can you take a look at it though? - Okay, sure.

268
00:13:57,956 --> 00:14:01,425
Let's see. "Name, Kook Ki Bong".

269
00:14:01,426 --> 00:14:03,191
Your phone number is correct.

270
00:14:03,456 --> 00:14:06,628
Your date of birth, current address, and permanent address...

271
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:08,355
"Never"?

272
00:14:08,926 --> 00:14:10,795
Why did you write "Never"? What does this mean?

273
00:14:10,796 --> 00:14:13,606
Oh, that. I've never seen the owner.

274
00:14:13,607 --> 00:14:15,372
- That's why I wrote that. - My gosh.

275
00:14:15,406 --> 00:14:17,805
You've never seen the owner?

276
00:14:17,806 --> 00:14:20,051
- That's why you wrote "Never"? - Yes.

277
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:22,764
Hang on. Have I met the owner before?

278
00:14:22,977 --> 00:14:24,405
Should I have written "Have met before"?

279
00:14:24,676 --> 00:14:27,486
- My goodness. - Hey, that's not what this means.

280
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:30,315
What? Then what does this mean?

281
00:14:30,316 --> 00:14:31,510
This means...

282
00:14:32,357 --> 00:14:33,510
Just forget it.

283
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:35,049
Let's move on for now.

284
00:14:35,156 --> 00:14:37,094
Shall I take a look at your cover letter?

285
00:14:38,456 --> 00:14:41,383
Hey, Ki Bong. Do you actually think this can be your cover letter?

286
00:14:41,926 --> 00:14:43,435
Why? Does it look weird?

287
00:14:43,436 --> 00:14:44,636
What did he write?

288
00:14:44,637 --> 00:14:46,136
I'll read it aloud for you. Just listen.

289
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:49,116
"Hello, I'm Kook Ki Bong."

290
00:14:49,406 --> 00:14:51,775
"My hobby is writing poems, and my specialty is baseball."

291
00:14:51,776 --> 00:14:54,091
"I wanted to be a pitcher in the major league,"

292
00:14:54,107 --> 00:14:55,372
"but I don't have a goal anymore."

293
00:14:55,507 --> 00:14:57,945
"My favorite food is sausage,"

294
00:14:57,946 --> 00:15:00,333
"and my least favorite is spinach."

295
00:15:00,546 --> 00:15:03,648
- In brackets, "I hate it." - I hate it.

296
00:15:04,117 --> 00:15:06,300
"That's all I have to say about myself."

297
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:09,596
- What do you think? - Hey, that's not a cover letter!

298
00:15:09,597 --> 00:15:11,356
Why not? You're supposed to introduce yourself.

299
00:15:11,357 --> 00:15:14,997
Kids say stuff like that when they introduce themselves to classmates.

300
00:15:15,026 --> 00:15:17,466
When you write a cover letter, you have to highlight your skills...

301
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:20,766
as well as why they must hire you.

302
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:22,949
Would you want to hire yourself if you were the employer?

303
00:15:23,007 --> 00:15:24,230
Oh, is that right?

304
00:15:24,676 --> 00:15:26,544
I didn't know because I had never written one before.

305
00:15:27,107 --> 00:15:28,376
Then shall I rewrite it?

306
00:15:28,377 --> 00:15:30,045
Of course you have to rewrite it.

307
00:15:30,046 --> 00:15:31,373
This is useless.

308
00:15:32,046 --> 00:15:33,271
Go rewrite it now.

309
00:15:33,387 --> 00:15:34,947
I did my best.

310
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:54,032
I'm back.

311
00:15:59,237 --> 00:16:01,695
What's going on? Where did everyone go?

312
00:16:03,747 --> 00:16:06,776
Why does he keep carrying that megaphone around?

313
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,624
Why is he sleeping there?

314
00:16:17,326 --> 00:16:20,458
Is he putting a blanket over Ki Bong?

315
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:24,096
Right. He might be a little immature,

316
00:16:24,097 --> 00:16:25,494
but he's kind-hearted.

317
00:16:30,137 --> 00:16:32,675
What? Did he just fart?

318
00:16:32,676 --> 00:16:34,775
Gosh, what's this smell?

319
00:16:34,776 --> 00:16:36,116
Who is it?

320
00:16:36,117 --> 00:16:37,815
- Who is this? - Gas, gas, gas!

321
00:16:37,816 --> 00:16:39,581
Jun Ki's gas time!

322
00:16:39,686 --> 00:16:41,586
Hey, stop it!

323
00:16:41,587 --> 00:16:42,983
Gosh!

324
00:16:43,387 --> 00:16:45,396
I said, stop it, you idiot!

325
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:48,077
I'm sorry. I just thought it'd be funny.

326
00:16:48,186 --> 00:16:49,206
Sorry.

327
00:16:49,497 --> 00:16:52,525
I stayed up all night writing the cover letter.

328
00:16:52,526 --> 00:16:53,821
I get it.

329
00:16:53,997 --> 00:16:56,266
I'll never do it again. Go back to sleep. Sorry again.

330
00:16:56,267 --> 00:16:57,836
My goodness.

331
00:16:57,837 --> 00:16:58,857
Go back to sleep.

332
00:17:07,246 --> 00:17:09,144
What is he doing? Why is he going back?

333
00:17:09,647 --> 00:17:10,972
No way.

334
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:19,162
Wait, what happened? I don't believe it.

335
00:17:19,256 --> 00:17:21,124
I failed to control the strength.

336
00:17:26,496 --> 00:17:27,854
My guess was right.

337
00:17:28,926 --> 00:17:31,344
Why did I fall for someone like him?

338
00:17:34,406 --> 00:17:38,354
We're done practicing the basic sounds now.

339
00:17:38,537 --> 00:17:40,893
Let's move on to sentence exercises.

340
00:17:41,107 --> 00:17:43,245
"The porridge next door is black bean porridge."

341
00:17:43,246 --> 00:17:45,490
"The porridge at the house in the back is red bean porridge."

342
00:17:46,587 --> 00:17:48,086
There she goes again.

343
00:17:48,087 --> 00:17:49,168
Ms. Han.

344
00:17:49,317 --> 00:17:51,415
Why do you keep blinking your eyes?

345
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,090
Try to focus!

346
00:17:53,256 --> 00:17:55,979
If you have eye problems, go see a doctor.

347
00:17:56,057 --> 00:17:58,954
Okay. I'm sorry.

348
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:01,787
Next.

349
00:18:03,196 --> 00:18:05,176
Why are there so many "two"s?

350
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:08,265
This one is a very hard one.

351
00:18:08,506 --> 00:18:11,106
Look closely at the way my mouth moves.

352
00:18:11,107 --> 00:18:12,127
Understood?

353
00:18:14,377 --> 00:18:16,915
"Is the movie I watched yesterday 'Alien Two',"

354
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,975
"'RoboCop 2', or 'Terminator 2'?"

355
00:18:18,976 --> 00:18:21,874
"No. I watched 'Back to the Future Two'."

356
00:18:23,117 --> 00:18:25,685
"Is the movie I watched yesterday 'Alien Two'..."

357
00:18:25,686 --> 00:18:27,012
"'RoboCop Two'?"

358
00:18:27,057 --> 00:18:29,955
"No. I watched 'Back to the Future Two'."

359
00:18:29,956 --> 00:18:32,995
You still can't say "two" clearly enough.

360
00:18:32,996 --> 00:18:34,995
Look closely at my mouth.

361
00:18:34,996 --> 00:18:36,048
Ma'am.

362
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:39,435
Can't I just practice "two" at home?

363
00:18:39,436 --> 00:18:41,854
No, you can't. To improve your diction,

364
00:18:41,936 --> 00:18:44,895
you need to see the correct way to move your mouth.

365
00:18:45,377 --> 00:18:46,632
Now...

366
00:18:47,077 --> 00:18:50,851
come closer so that you can see it more clearly.

367
00:18:53,516 --> 00:18:55,816
"Is the movie I watched yesterday 'Alien Two'..."

368
00:18:55,817 --> 00:18:58,673
"or 'Terminator 2'? It's 'Back to the Future 2'."

369
00:18:58,956 --> 00:19:01,231
Don't turn your face away from me.

370
00:19:01,426 --> 00:19:03,640
Watch how my mouth moves!

371
00:19:04,127 --> 00:19:05,147
All right.

372
00:19:05,696 --> 00:19:08,481
I'll show you again. Watch carefully.

373
00:19:08,696 --> 00:19:11,066
"Is the movie I watched yesterday 'Alien Two'..."

374
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:14,065
"or 'RoboCop 2'? It's 'Back to the Future 2'."

375
00:19:15,807 --> 00:19:18,019
Is Soo Yeon still at the academy?

376
00:19:18,037 --> 00:19:19,159
It seems so.

377
00:19:19,277 --> 00:19:21,245
She seems pretty determined this time.

378
00:19:21,246 --> 00:19:23,011
That's impressive.

379
00:19:23,976 --> 00:19:26,394
I thought she was just a naive girl with rich parents.

380
00:19:26,647 --> 00:19:28,422
Yu Ri!

381
00:19:28,547 --> 00:19:30,832
I wrote a new cover letter. Can you take a look?

382
00:19:31,156 --> 00:19:32,207
You did?

383
00:19:32,486 --> 00:19:34,016
Let me see.

384
00:19:34,426 --> 00:19:36,976
"Hello, my name is Kook Ki Bong."

385
00:19:36,996 --> 00:19:40,535
"All my life, baseball was my everything."

386
00:19:40,726 --> 00:19:44,775
"There was nothing else I liked or could do well."

387
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:47,066
That's a pretty nice beginning.

388
00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:48,332
It sure is.

389
00:19:50,377 --> 00:19:52,475
"Some people even said..."

390
00:19:52,476 --> 00:19:54,485
"I was a boaring person."

391
00:19:54,506 --> 00:19:57,675
Wait, what do you mean by "boaring"?

392
00:19:57,676 --> 00:19:58,799
You don't know that word?

393
00:19:59,077 --> 00:20:00,342
A "boaring" person.

394
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:02,316
Someone who is...

395
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:04,485
dull and uninteresting.

396
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:06,925
Hey, it's not "boaring".

397
00:20:06,926 --> 00:20:08,517
It's "boring".

398
00:20:08,986 --> 00:20:11,608
Is it? I didn't know.

399
00:20:11,897 --> 00:20:13,222
I'll correct it.

400
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:15,091
Let me just keep reading.

401
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:19,345
"But there was one thing I liked as much as I liked baseball."

402
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:21,611
"It was cars."

403
00:20:21,766 --> 00:20:24,530
"Even without someone telling me to do dis and dat..."

404
00:20:24,676 --> 00:20:27,106
"Dis and dat"?

405
00:20:27,107 --> 00:20:28,983
You don't know what that means?

406
00:20:29,107 --> 00:20:32,415
It's when someone makes you...

407
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,116
do different things.

408
00:20:34,117 --> 00:20:37,086
It's not "dis and dat".

409
00:20:37,087 --> 00:20:38,586
It's "this and that".

410
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:40,685
No. It's "dis and dat".

411
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:42,319
I'm confident about this one.

412
00:20:42,887 --> 00:20:45,447
Forget it. I'll just keep reading.

413
00:20:45,756 --> 00:20:47,765
"If you miss a talent like me and regret it afterwards,"

414
00:20:47,766 --> 00:20:50,245
"it'd be rocking the stable door after the horse is stolen."

415
00:20:50,496 --> 00:20:53,566
"Rocking the stable door"? What do you mean?

416
00:20:53,567 --> 00:20:55,678
It's a proverb.

417
00:20:55,706 --> 00:20:58,256
"To rock the stable door after the horse is stolen."

418
00:20:58,476 --> 00:21:01,475
Even if you rock the stable door after the horse is stolen,

419
00:21:01,476 --> 00:21:03,146
you can't get the horse back.

420
00:21:03,147 --> 00:21:04,975
It means there's no point...

421
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:06,915
in regretting something that has already happened.

422
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,715
What are you talking about?

423
00:21:08,716 --> 00:21:10,515
It's not "rocking the stable door".

424
00:21:10,516 --> 00:21:12,586
It's "locking the stable door".

425
00:21:12,587 --> 00:21:14,955
But it sounds surprisingly natural.

426
00:21:14,956 --> 00:21:17,578
I don't think so. I'm pretty sure it's "rocking".

427
00:21:17,827 --> 00:21:20,112
I remember reading it in a book somewhere.

428
00:21:20,397 --> 00:21:21,550
Gosh, my blood pressure is going up.

429
00:21:21,797 --> 00:21:24,465
I'll correct it. You go to your room.

430
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:25,636
Get out of my sight!

431
00:21:25,637 --> 00:21:28,435
What? Stop telling me to do dis and dat.

432
00:21:28,436 --> 00:21:30,344
That's wrong.

433
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,257
Woo Shik.

434
00:21:32,607 --> 00:21:35,806
Get him out of my sight. Right now!

435
00:21:35,807 --> 00:21:37,550
Oh, okay.

436
00:21:39,377 --> 00:21:40,985
Go to your room.

437
00:21:40,986 --> 00:21:42,140
She's really angry.

438
00:21:42,347 --> 00:21:44,015
What's the big deal?

439
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:45,915
Failure is the sister of success.

440
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,386
Gosh, come here.

441
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:49,510
- What's wrong? - Come here!

442
00:21:49,587 --> 00:21:51,056
"Terminator Two".

443
00:21:51,426 --> 00:21:53,130
"Terminator Two".

444
00:21:53,297 --> 00:21:54,929
"Back to the Future Two".

445
00:21:55,027 --> 00:21:56,669
"Back to the Future Two".

446
00:21:57,266 --> 00:21:59,275
"Back to the Future Two".

447
00:21:59,637 --> 00:22:01,366
"Back to the Future Two".

448
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:02,405
Ta, tya, teo, tyeo...

449
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:05,076
Ta, tya, teo, tyeo, to, tyo, tu, tyu, teu, ti.

450
00:22:05,077 --> 00:22:07,933
- Ta, tya, teo, tyeo... - To, tyo, tu, tyu, teu, ti.

451
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:11,544
I'll take you to a really nice lunch place.

452
00:22:11,617 --> 00:22:12,876
- Cheonggukjang... - Hold on.

453
00:22:12,877 --> 00:22:14,987
Gosh, you startled me. What's the matter?

454
00:22:15,117 --> 00:22:16,386
In today's Korean society,

455
00:22:16,387 --> 00:22:19,255
many people make the mistake of judging a person too fast.

456
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:21,955
Apparently, there is a man who failed to see...

457
00:22:21,956 --> 00:22:24,296
a person's full potential by judging her too fast.

458
00:22:24,297 --> 00:22:25,755
Report Special Force met the man.

459
00:22:25,756 --> 00:22:27,093
What are you doing right now?

460
00:22:28,127 --> 00:22:29,248
I'm not done yet.

461
00:22:29,597 --> 00:22:31,896
"The manager of the soy sauce factory is Mr. Jang."

462
00:22:31,897 --> 00:22:34,182
"The manager of the doenjang factory is Mr. Kang."

463
00:22:34,266 --> 00:22:35,765
"The porridge next door is black bean porridge."

464
00:22:35,766 --> 00:22:37,276
"The porridge at the house in the back is red bean porridge."

465
00:22:37,277 --> 00:22:38,636
"Is the movie I watched yesterday 'Alien Two',"

466
00:22:38,637 --> 00:22:39,945
"'RoboCop 2', or 'Terminator 2'?"

467
00:22:39,946 --> 00:22:42,047
"No. I watched 'Back to the Future Two'."

468
00:22:43,147 --> 00:22:45,767
What do you think? Do you still think my diction is bad?

469
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:48,263
Do you still think I can't be a reporter?

470
00:22:51,087 --> 00:22:52,177
Guys!

471
00:22:53,327 --> 00:22:54,378
Guys!

472
00:22:55,027 --> 00:22:56,108
You're back.

473
00:22:56,357 --> 00:22:57,519
How did it go?

474
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,126
I got in.

475
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:02,265
The director of the broadcasting station wanted to hire me.

476
00:23:02,266 --> 00:23:04,665
- Really? - Yes, after a month,

477
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,405
they'll decide whether or not I'll get a contract.

478
00:23:06,406 --> 00:23:08,405
Soo Yeon, you did it.

479
00:23:08,406 --> 00:23:10,205
I told you I can accomplish anything I put my mind to.

480
00:23:10,206 --> 00:23:12,606
Right. They say a face can move mountains.

481
00:23:12,607 --> 00:23:14,412
Soo Yeon, you must be so thrilled.

482
00:23:14,506 --> 00:23:16,745
What? "A face can move mountains"?

483
00:23:16,746 --> 00:23:19,848
Yes, if a person works hard enough,

484
00:23:19,887 --> 00:23:22,816
he or she can achieve anything.

485
00:23:22,817 --> 00:23:25,132
It's "faith", not a "face".

486
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:28,380
Ki Bong, stay right there.

487
00:23:28,686 --> 00:23:30,564
What's wrong?

488
00:23:30,597 --> 00:23:31,896
I made a mistake, so what?

489
00:23:31,897 --> 00:23:33,427
Come here. Come here right now!

490
00:23:34,127 --> 00:23:35,796
Don't do anything you'll regret later.

491
00:23:35,797 --> 00:23:39,136
It'd be rocking the stable door after the horse is stolen.

492
00:23:39,137 --> 00:23:40,536
I told you it's wrong!

493
00:23:40,537 --> 00:23:42,914
I'll teach you a lesson today. Come here! Right now!

494
00:23:44,607 --> 00:23:46,412
- Come here. - Don't say it if you're not sure.

495
00:23:46,607 --> 00:23:48,445
Why is he so stubborn?

496
00:23:48,446 --> 00:23:49,600
I know.

497
00:23:50,617 --> 00:23:52,546
By the way, where is Jun Ki?

498
00:23:52,547 --> 00:23:54,453
I'm not sure. He went out with the megaphone a while ago.

499
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,525
What is he up to these days?

500
00:23:56,956 --> 00:23:58,445
Jung Eun, do you have any idea?

501
00:23:58,516 --> 00:24:00,770
I don't. Why would you ask me about him?

502
00:24:03,496 --> 00:24:05,568
What's with her? Why did she have to snap like that?

503
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:10,413
Why would he ask me about Jun Ki?

504
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:13,465
How can I have feelings for such an idiot?

505
00:24:13,466 --> 00:24:15,344
I must be out of my mind.

506
00:24:18,436 --> 00:24:19,701
What is it now?

507
00:24:21,147 --> 00:24:22,707
- What? - Jung Eun.

508
00:24:22,847 --> 00:24:23,915
Meet me outside.

509
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:25,346
Outside? Why?

510
00:24:25,347 --> 00:24:27,122
Come out, and you'll see.

511
00:24:27,516 --> 00:24:28,670
Hurry up!

512
00:24:31,986 --> 00:24:34,199
Why does he want me to come out at this late hour?

513
00:24:39,127 --> 00:24:40,765
What is it?

514
00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:41,889
Give me just a second.

515
00:24:43,097 --> 00:24:44,769
What are you doing? Come here right now!

516
00:24:50,736 --> 00:24:52,106
What is he doing here?

517
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:53,228
You'll find out soon.

518
00:25:05,317 --> 00:25:06,408
What are you waiting for?

519
00:25:06,827 --> 00:25:07,847
Go ahead.

520
00:25:08,027 --> 00:25:09,250
Fine.

521
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:12,664
Jung Eun, I'm sorry.

522
00:25:14,297 --> 00:25:15,724
I shouldn't have done it.

523
00:25:17,867 --> 00:25:19,529
- Are you happy now? - "Are you happy now"?

524
00:25:19,837 --> 00:25:21,703
Was that an apology?

525
00:25:23,277 --> 00:25:25,755
It didn't sound sincere at all.

526
00:25:26,607 --> 00:25:28,442
I guess I have no choice.

527
00:25:32,746 --> 00:25:36,316
Attention! The famous news anchor, Jo Sang Woo,

528
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:38,586
fooled around with my innocent friend...

529
00:25:38,587 --> 00:25:39,882
I'm sorry, Jung Eun.

530
00:25:39,986 --> 00:25:41,965
I must have been out of my mind.

531
00:25:42,456 --> 00:25:44,261
It'll never happen again.

532
00:25:44,327 --> 00:25:45,958
Please forgive me this once.

533
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:48,227
I get it, so just go back now.

534
00:25:49,766 --> 00:25:50,858
Thank you.

535
00:25:54,307 --> 00:25:55,536
Are we done now?

536
00:25:55,537 --> 00:25:58,973
No more protests in front of the broadcasting station, okay?

537
00:25:59,607 --> 00:26:00,668
Okay.

538
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:05,015
I'm only letting you get away because my friend says it's okay.

539
00:26:05,446 --> 00:26:08,099
If you ever bother my innocent friend...

540
00:26:09,587 --> 00:26:11,493
No. If you act like that to women again,

541
00:26:11,857 --> 00:26:15,121
I'm going to make a fuss about it on the news instead!

542
00:26:15,186 --> 00:26:17,267
- All right? - Okay.

543
00:26:17,597 --> 00:26:19,086
I'll leave, okay?

544
00:26:19,656 --> 00:26:21,156
I'll go now, Jung Eun.

545
00:26:25,797 --> 00:26:26,928
Good job!

546
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,905
Hey, Jun Ki. What was that?

547
00:26:30,906 --> 00:26:34,313
He didn't even apologize to you properly.

548
00:26:36,577 --> 00:26:39,708
How was it? Are you feeling better?

549
00:26:42,387 --> 00:26:45,273
Oh, and if someone harasses you again,

550
00:26:46,156 --> 00:26:47,310
come and tell me.

551
00:26:47,887 --> 00:26:50,916
I'm going to completely smash those who bother my friend!

552
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:54,287
Understood?

553
00:26:56,736 --> 00:26:57,890
That's better.

554
00:26:59,097 --> 00:27:00,362
Let's go home now, friend.

555
00:27:39,637 --> 00:27:41,076
Hello, everyone.

556
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:42,882
This is Han Soo Yeon of Report Special Force.

557
00:27:43,176 --> 00:27:46,046
Today, I'm here to meet the world renowned conductor of..

558
00:27:46,047 --> 00:27:48,945
the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, Park Chul Hong, who has turned...

559
00:27:48,946 --> 00:27:50,445
a new chapter in his life to be the owner of a sheep farm.

560
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:53,191
- How was it? - I like it!

561
00:27:53,357 --> 00:27:54,455
It was good.

562
00:27:54,456 --> 00:27:56,286
Yes, you sounded like a real reporter.

563
00:27:56,287 --> 00:27:57,419
Really?

564
00:27:57,797 --> 00:28:00,695
I stayed up all night practicing for the first shoot.

565
00:28:00,696 --> 00:28:02,066
I'm still so worried.

566
00:28:02,067 --> 00:28:04,718
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

567
00:28:04,837 --> 00:28:05,958
Thanks.

568
00:28:08,206 --> 00:28:09,665
Ta-da! How do I look?

569
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:10,975
Wow! You look terrible.

570
00:28:10,976 --> 00:28:12,609
It looks like you've stolen your dad's suit.

571
00:28:12,936 --> 00:28:15,905
Really? I guess it's because I've only been wearing baseball uniforms.

572
00:28:16,916 --> 00:28:18,345
Why the suit, all of a sudden?

573
00:28:19,577 --> 00:28:21,524
It's your first day at work too, isn't it?

574
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:24,610
I finished my training yesterday and it's my first official day.

575
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:28,194
I guess there are two people at our house that are starting work today.

576
00:28:28,226 --> 00:28:30,266
Be careful not to make a mistake and do well.

577
00:28:30,496 --> 00:28:33,455
- Especially you, Ki Bong. - All right.

578
00:28:34,666 --> 00:28:36,054
I'm late! I'll have to go.

579
00:28:36,527 --> 00:28:38,735
- Good luck! - Ki Bong, wait for me!

580
00:28:38,736 --> 00:28:40,465
I have to catch the express bus.

581
00:28:40,466 --> 00:28:42,235
The express bus? Where's the shoot?

582
00:28:42,236 --> 00:28:44,114
- Pyeongchang, Gangwon-do. - Pyeongchang?

583
00:28:44,976 --> 00:28:47,150
- Should I give you a ride? - You?

584
00:28:47,946 --> 00:28:49,885
You said you're scheduled for something today.

585
00:28:51,176 --> 00:28:53,421
It just happens to be near Pyeongchang.

586
00:28:53,587 --> 00:28:54,811
I'll drop you off on the way.

587
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:00,041
(Extreme Job)

588
00:29:09,627 --> 00:29:12,217
You should have stopped practicing and gotten some sleep.

589
00:29:12,496 --> 00:29:14,444
How are you going to manage when you were up all night?

590
00:29:14,466 --> 00:29:17,435
It's okay. I'll be fine soon.

591
00:29:20,476 --> 00:29:23,026
Anyways, thanks for the ride.

592
00:29:23,176 --> 00:29:24,299
No problem.

593
00:29:24,416 --> 00:29:26,386
I'm just dropping you off on the way.

594
00:29:27,147 --> 00:29:29,053
By the way, what time do you finish?

595
00:29:29,287 --> 00:29:30,785
I'll pick you up afterwards.

596
00:29:31,087 --> 00:29:33,056
No, it's fine. I don't want to tire you.

597
00:29:33,057 --> 00:29:35,128
- I'll just go by myself. - What do you mean, tire me?

598
00:29:35,186 --> 00:29:36,931
It's right around the corner.

599
00:29:37,756 --> 00:29:40,785
All right. I'll call you when it's over.

600
00:29:40,966 --> 00:29:42,630
- See you. - Okay. Good luck.

601
00:29:42,827 --> 00:29:44,367
- Let's go, Soo Yeon! - Let's go!

602
00:29:53,337 --> 00:29:55,387
Yes, hello? Me?

603
00:29:55,676 --> 00:29:56,971
I'm on my way to the event.

604
00:29:57,446 --> 00:29:58,804
There's a lot of traffic.

605
00:29:59,117 --> 00:30:01,493
I'm right around the corner.

606
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:03,038
I'll be right there.

607
00:30:04,287 --> 00:30:05,409
Gosh, I'm late!

608
00:30:08,426 --> 00:30:09,786
How's the gasoline mileage on this car?

609
00:30:09,787 --> 00:30:10,919
The gasoline mileage?

610
00:30:11,057 --> 00:30:13,342
It's... It was...

611
00:30:13,996 --> 00:30:15,394
quiet good.

612
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,366
So how far will it go by liter?

613
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:19,622
By liter?

614
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:21,859
Just a minute, sir. I...

615
00:30:23,807 --> 00:30:25,505
This is so irritating.

616
00:30:25,506 --> 00:30:26,598
Forget about it.

617
00:30:27,476 --> 00:30:30,301
Sir! The gasoline mileage is...

618
00:30:30,377 --> 00:30:33,616
16, no, 20 or 30...

619
00:30:33,617 --> 00:30:34,707
Kook Ki Bong!

620
00:30:35,787 --> 00:30:37,010
What do you think you're doing?

621
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:39,228
How can you call yourself a dealer and not know the gasoline mileage?

622
00:30:39,287 --> 00:30:41,469
Do you realize how many customers you lost today?

623
00:30:42,557 --> 00:30:45,004
- I'm sorry. - "I'm sorry" won't do it.

624
00:30:45,156 --> 00:30:47,716
Make sure to sell a car today.

625
00:30:48,067 --> 00:30:50,026
If you can't, don't even think about coming back tomorrow.

626
00:30:50,027 --> 00:30:51,366
- What? - Got it?

627
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:53,165
Yes, sir.

628
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:56,196
How did we end up with him? This is so annoying.

629
00:30:57,706 --> 00:30:58,900
Yes, Mr. Kim!

630
00:30:59,976 --> 00:31:01,781
This is driving me crazy.

631
00:31:10,887 --> 00:31:12,243
What are you so focused on?

632
00:31:12,587 --> 00:31:16,737
This is the government website for the Youth Support Business.

633
00:31:17,027 --> 00:31:20,495
I was wondering if I can get support when I set up my restaurant.

634
00:31:20,496 --> 00:31:22,296
There's something called the Youth Support Business?

635
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,439
- Yes, I guess so. - I see.

636
00:31:27,867 --> 00:31:30,427
What is Jung Eun doing in her room? She hasn't even eaten.

637
00:31:31,236 --> 00:31:32,400
Wait a minute.

638
00:31:36,206 --> 00:31:37,816
Gosh! You surprised me!

639
00:31:37,817 --> 00:31:39,203
What am I, a ghost?

640
00:31:39,777 --> 00:31:41,846
Why would you get surprised? Come out and eat.

641
00:31:41,847 --> 00:31:43,116
Whatever! You eat all you want.

642
00:31:43,117 --> 00:31:44,616
What are you getting mad at me for?

643
00:31:44,617 --> 00:31:46,056
When did I get mad at you?

644
00:31:46,057 --> 00:31:47,178
Mad, my foot.

645
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,747
What? That punk.

646
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:52,856
What did I do?

647
00:31:52,857 --> 00:31:55,008
Your presence itself is usually the mistake,

648
00:31:55,196 --> 00:31:57,032
but there must be something else you did.

649
00:31:57,236 --> 00:31:59,480
No, there isn't.

650
00:31:59,537 --> 00:32:00,832
Then why would she act that way?

651
00:32:01,266 --> 00:32:04,337
Anyways, I'll go find out more about this support,

652
00:32:04,406 --> 00:32:05,763
so go on in and apologize to her.

653
00:32:06,837 --> 00:32:07,927
I'm going.

654
00:32:09,077 --> 00:32:10,198
All right.

655
00:32:12,476 --> 00:32:15,200
I'm sure I didn't do anything wrong.

656
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:20,507
Jung Eun?

657
00:32:21,686 --> 00:32:22,809
What do you want?

658
00:32:28,027 --> 00:32:32,036
Hey, did I do something wrong, by any chance?

659
00:32:32,037 --> 00:32:33,260
That's not it.

660
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:35,039
Then why are you acting this way?

661
00:32:35,607 --> 00:32:37,473
What is it? Tell me.

662
00:32:38,476 --> 00:32:42,015
Is it because I added soy sauce in your coke?

663
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:43,852
What? That was you?

664
00:32:44,577 --> 00:32:45,668
That's not it?

665
00:32:48,117 --> 00:32:51,553
Then it must be because I played ice-hockey with your shoe today!

666
00:32:51,956 --> 00:32:53,140
You did that, too?

667
00:32:53,456 --> 00:32:54,507
That's not it, either?

668
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,025
Then this must be it!

669
00:32:57,897 --> 00:32:59,937
I got it. Gosh.

670
00:33:02,496 --> 00:33:04,199
Here. I'll return it. Fine.

671
00:33:04,597 --> 00:33:07,596
Your wallet was in the kitchen, so I couldn't help it.

672
00:33:07,837 --> 00:33:09,965
- You even stole my money? - I didn't steal it.

673
00:33:09,966 --> 00:33:12,690
I just borrowed it for a while without telling you.

674
00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:13,898
I returned it, so we're good, right?

675
00:33:14,176 --> 00:33:17,206
- Come on, don't be angry. - Whatever. Just leave.

676
00:33:17,377 --> 00:33:18,601
Get out!

677
00:33:19,847 --> 00:33:21,622
This is too much.

678
00:33:23,246 --> 00:33:24,541
Fine. All right.

679
00:33:26,857 --> 00:33:28,591
I took another one last time, too.

680
00:33:29,486 --> 00:33:30,925
I'll give it back. All right?

681
00:33:34,027 --> 00:33:35,659
Today, I'm with the New York Philharmonic...

682
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:39,031
Why is my voice so hoarse?

683
00:33:42,966 --> 00:33:44,741
And I'm so sleepy.

684
00:33:45,307 --> 00:33:46,664
Are you all set, Soo Yeon?

685
00:33:46,936 --> 00:33:48,106
Yes, I am.

686
00:33:48,107 --> 00:33:51,747
You've been boasting it to the chief director.

687
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,711
Let's see how well you do.

688
00:33:54,486 --> 00:33:56,180
I'll try my best.

689
00:33:57,057 --> 00:34:00,255
But where is Mr. Park? I want to do a prior interview.

690
00:34:00,256 --> 00:34:01,308
Is that so?

691
00:34:02,256 --> 00:34:03,348
There he is.

692
00:34:20,007 --> 00:34:21,406
Hello, sir.

693
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:23,283
I'm the interviewer for today, Han Soo Yeon.

694
00:34:26,217 --> 00:34:29,582
Hello.

695
00:34:31,257 --> 00:34:34,959
Thank you for coming...

696
00:34:36,587 --> 00:34:40,125
all the way here.

697
00:34:41,096 --> 00:34:43,616
Why is he speaking so slowly?

698
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:47,945
I look forward to the interview today.

699
00:34:48,107 --> 00:34:50,147
Yes.

700
00:34:51,936 --> 00:34:53,130
But...

701
00:34:54,246 --> 00:34:58,225
it's been such a long time...

702
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:03,566
since I'd had an interview,

703
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:06,196
so I'm so nervous.

704
00:35:07,826 --> 00:35:10,549
My eyes might get wide...

705
00:35:11,996 --> 00:35:15,363
and I might speak too fast.

706
00:35:15,967 --> 00:35:18,139
I'm in quite...

707
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:22,879
a sensitive state...

708
00:35:26,877 --> 00:35:28,946
Soo Yeon. Soo Yeon!

709
00:35:28,947 --> 00:35:30,171
What?

710
00:35:32,516 --> 00:35:33,976
Soo Yeon, were you dozing off?

711
00:35:35,547 --> 00:35:36,669
I'm sorry.

712
00:35:36,947 --> 00:35:39,915
To be honest, I was up all night practicing.

713
00:35:41,326 --> 00:35:43,725
Sir, we'll begin right away, then.

714
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:44,818
Let's go.

715
00:35:45,326 --> 00:35:46,449
I'm sorry.

716
00:35:46,996 --> 00:35:48,118
It's fine.

717
00:35:54,766 --> 00:35:56,337
This is driving me crazy!

718
00:35:57,136 --> 00:35:59,336
But he looks so sleepy and his voice makes it worse.

719
00:35:59,337 --> 00:36:01,142
He's practically a human sleeping pill!

720
00:36:02,806 --> 00:36:05,397
Wake up, Soo Yeon. Focus.

721
00:36:09,886 --> 00:36:11,487
What? This is done.

722
00:36:16,157 --> 00:36:17,789
(Buy a new moisturizer.)

725
00:36:33,576 --> 00:36:35,994
By the way, why Jun Ki?

726
00:36:37,677 --> 00:36:39,245
I actually have feelings for him?

727
00:36:39,246 --> 00:36:40,345
(I have feelings for him?)

728
00:36:40,346 --> 00:36:41,366
I do?

729
00:36:42,416 --> 00:36:43,773
Am I going crazy?

730
00:36:44,857 --> 00:36:49,345
No, no, no, no, no.....

731
00:36:49,386 --> 00:36:50,855
Jung Eun, come out for a second!

732
00:36:51,456 --> 00:36:53,844
- Hey, Kim Jung Eun! - Why is he calling me again?

733
00:36:53,857 --> 00:36:55,326
I'm so uncomfortable around him.

734
00:37:01,407 --> 00:37:02,427
What now?

735
00:37:03,036 --> 00:37:04,435
You got a package. Over there.

736
00:37:04,436 --> 00:37:05,497
A package?

737
00:37:10,976 --> 00:37:11,996
Jung Eun!

738
00:37:12,677 --> 00:37:15,546
Jung Eun. Are you all right?

739
00:37:15,547 --> 00:37:17,657
My back... My back!

740
00:37:17,717 --> 00:37:19,317
Why did you run?

741
00:37:20,057 --> 00:37:21,247
Can you move?

742
00:37:21,357 --> 00:37:22,407
Try to move.

743
00:37:23,427 --> 00:37:24,784
I can't move at all.

744
00:37:24,927 --> 00:37:27,626
That's not good. Shouldn't you go see a doctor?

745
00:37:27,627 --> 00:37:30,196
Gosh, forget it. Just take me to my room.

746
00:37:30,197 --> 00:37:31,258
Okay.

747
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:34,302
Come here. Goodness.

748
00:37:38,907 --> 00:37:39,957
My back...

749
00:37:41,206 --> 00:37:42,676
Be gentle!

750
00:37:43,007 --> 00:37:44,404
I am being gentle.

751
00:37:48,186 --> 00:37:49,441
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

752
00:37:49,487 --> 00:37:51,455
No, I'm fine. I can just put on a pain-relieving patch.

753
00:37:51,456 --> 00:37:52,455
Where is it?

754
00:37:52,456 --> 00:37:54,363
Over there, in the dressing table drawer...

755
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,595
(Lee Jun Ki, I have feelings for him?)

756
00:37:58,596 --> 00:37:59,626
(I do?)

757
00:37:59,627 --> 00:38:00,718
(Am I going crazy or what?)

758
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:02,519
In the dressing table drawer?

759
00:38:02,996 --> 00:38:04,696
- I'll bring it for you. - No, no.

760
00:38:04,697 --> 00:38:06,195
I just remembered that I used it up.

761
00:38:07,536 --> 00:38:09,836
Can you step out and pick up...

762
00:38:09,837 --> 00:38:11,611
a pack of pain-relieving patches for me?

763
00:38:11,837 --> 00:38:13,475
Sure, I'll be right back.

764
00:38:13,476 --> 00:38:14,496
Okay.

765
00:38:18,516 --> 00:38:20,312
I cannot let Jun Ki see that.

766
00:38:20,686 --> 00:38:21,910
I need to put it away now.

767
00:38:23,186 --> 00:38:24,278
Gosh, my back...

768
00:38:25,556 --> 00:38:27,596
Fine, I have no choice.

769
00:38:28,657 --> 00:38:30,594
1, 2...

770
00:38:31,197 --> 00:38:32,278
Three.

771
00:38:43,636 --> 00:38:44,698
Here it is!

772
00:38:45,936 --> 00:38:46,935
What are you doing?

773
00:38:46,936 --> 00:38:48,987
What? I'm...

774
00:38:49,206 --> 00:38:50,975
Do you need something? Shall I find it for you?

775
00:38:50,976 --> 00:38:52,037
Don't come!

776
00:38:53,047 --> 00:38:54,750
Why are you yelling at me?

777
00:38:54,817 --> 00:38:55,970
When did I yell?

778
00:38:56,217 --> 00:38:59,042
I crawled down because I was bored.

779
00:38:59,357 --> 00:39:02,142
Jun Ki, can you lay me down on my bed?

780
00:39:02,587 --> 00:39:03,607
Sure.

781
00:39:06,127 --> 00:39:07,523
Come here. Watch your back.

782
00:39:07,596 --> 00:39:08,896
Gosh, be gentle.

783
00:39:08,897 --> 00:39:09,948
All right.

784
00:39:17,837 --> 00:39:19,918
Why did you crawl down to the floor to begin with?

785
00:39:22,047 --> 00:39:23,169
Shall I put this on for you?

786
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,561
No, I'll do it myself. You can leave now.

787
00:39:25,677 --> 00:39:27,245
- Go! - Call me if you need anything.

788
00:39:27,246 --> 00:39:28,266
- Okay. - All right.

789
00:39:31,556 --> 00:39:33,352
I was so close.

790
00:39:34,357 --> 00:39:35,855
This is driving me bonkers.

791
00:39:38,956 --> 00:39:40,936
Why isn't anyone coming in?

792
00:39:41,726 --> 00:39:44,073
I have to sell a car before the end of the day.

793
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:51,408
Hello, ma'am.

(Official Dealer Kook Ki Bong)

795
00:39:53,136 --> 00:39:54,745
I'm here to take a look at a car.

796
00:39:54,746 --> 00:39:56,440
Oh, is that right?

797
00:39:56,607 --> 00:39:58,688
What kind of car are you looking for?

798
00:39:59,116 --> 00:40:02,046
A compact car? A midsize sedan? An SUV?

799
00:40:02,047 --> 00:40:03,413
Or an electric car?

800
00:40:03,487 --> 00:40:04,955
Please tell me what you're looking for.

801
00:40:04,956 --> 00:40:07,028
There's actually a specific model I have in mind.

802
00:40:07,487 --> 00:40:08,650
Oh, that one over there.

803
00:40:08,886 --> 00:40:11,455
Would I be able to do a test drive?

804
00:40:11,456 --> 00:40:13,325
Of course, ma'am.

805
00:40:13,326 --> 00:40:16,066
We can stop by at a grocery store, right?

806
00:40:16,067 --> 00:40:17,296
I have to buy a few things.

807
00:40:17,297 --> 00:40:19,030
Pardon? Well, that's...

808
00:40:19,266 --> 00:40:21,042
Yes, of course. By all means.

809
00:40:21,806 --> 00:40:23,439
My gosh, thank you very much.

810
00:40:23,936 --> 00:40:25,305
You can put everything on the table.

811
00:40:25,306 --> 00:40:26,459
Oh, okay.

812
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:31,596
By the way, when would you like to sign the purchasing contract?

813
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:33,025
Oh, well...

814
00:40:33,727 --> 00:40:35,266
I need some time to think.

815
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:36,317
Pardon me?

816
00:40:36,636 --> 00:40:38,575
Well, I'll get going then.

817
00:40:39,607 --> 00:40:41,275
I was just kidding.

818
00:40:41,276 --> 00:40:43,076
How could I not buy the car after all this?

819
00:40:43,077 --> 00:40:44,106
Bring the contract.

820
00:40:44,107 --> 00:40:46,422
Really? Thank you.

821
00:40:46,847 --> 00:40:48,000
Thank you, ma'am!

822
00:40:49,446 --> 00:40:50,568
I'm home.

823
00:40:53,816 --> 00:40:54,836
Who's this guy?

824
00:40:55,457 --> 00:40:58,690
Hello, sir. I'm a dealer from Kisung Motors, Kook Ki Bong.

825
00:40:59,287 --> 00:41:02,396
A dealer? What's going on? Honey, are you really buying a car?

826
00:41:02,397 --> 00:41:04,742
- Yes. - I told you that you can't.

827
00:41:04,866 --> 00:41:06,965
You're home all day. Why do you need a car?

828
00:41:06,966 --> 00:41:08,635
I certainly need a car.

829
00:41:08,636 --> 00:41:10,565
I have to pick up our kids and get groceries.

830
00:41:10,566 --> 00:41:11,933
I need it for many reasons.

831
00:41:12,566 --> 00:41:14,310
I said you can't buy a car. End of discussion.

832
00:41:14,636 --> 00:41:16,635
Look. We don't need a car, so please leave.

833
00:41:16,636 --> 00:41:17,697
Sorry?

834
00:41:17,807 --> 00:41:19,337
Oh, okay.

835
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:21,246
Gosh, where are you going?

836
00:41:21,247 --> 00:41:23,246
If you leave now, I won't sign the contact.

837
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:25,867
- Pardon me? - Honey, are you provoking me?

838
00:41:26,847 --> 00:41:28,214
Follow me.

839
00:41:28,557 --> 00:41:31,790
Goodness. Do you think that will scare me?

840
00:41:32,287 --> 00:41:35,591
Gosh, wait. Ma'am, then what should I...

841
00:41:39,827 --> 00:41:42,386
Is she going to sign the contract or what?

842
00:41:44,014 --> 00:41:47,107
(Sheep Farm)

843
00:41:47,108 --> 00:41:49,904
Sir, I'm curious about something.

844
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,918
You were a world-renowned conductor.

845
00:41:51,919 --> 00:41:54,846
What inspired you to start a sheep farm?

846
00:41:58,218 --> 00:41:59,513
I started it...

847
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:02,117
because...

848
00:42:03,028 --> 00:42:08,638
I love lamb skewers.

849
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:11,755
Oh, I see.

850
00:42:13,568 --> 00:42:16,190
This must be the sheep pen.

851
00:42:18,378 --> 00:42:20,521
They're so cute.

852
00:42:21,608 --> 00:42:28,279
I always look after them with love.

853
00:42:30,818 --> 00:42:32,043
That's probably why.

854
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:38,591
No, I must not doze off. Wake up, Soo Yeon.

855
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,557
Oh, I see.

856
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:44,615
How many sheep do you own in total?

857
00:42:46,499 --> 00:42:48,099
Well, I'm not sure.

858
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:53,654
I don't know the exact number.

859
00:42:56,349 --> 00:43:00,295
Shall we try counting them?

860
00:43:05,289 --> 00:43:07,022
Sheep number one.

861
00:43:07,959 --> 00:43:10,438
Sheep number two.

862
00:43:11,428 --> 00:43:14,010
Sheep number three.

863
00:43:14,968 --> 00:43:17,793
Sheep number four.

864
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:21,159
Sheep number five.

865
00:43:22,108 --> 00:43:24,353
Sheep number six.

866
00:43:25,238 --> 00:43:27,547
Sheep number seven.

867
00:43:27,548 --> 00:43:29,547
Soo Yeon, what are you doing? Did you doze off again?

868
00:43:29,548 --> 00:43:32,231
Sheep number eight.

869
00:43:33,249 --> 00:43:36,688
- Sheep number nine. - I'm sorry. I apologize.

870
00:43:36,689 --> 00:43:38,596
Why do you keep dozing off?

871
00:43:38,959 --> 00:43:40,214
I'm really sorry.

872
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:42,905
Soo Yeon, this is your last chance.

873
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:44,378
Okay?

874
00:43:44,398 --> 00:43:45,959
Yes. Got it, sir.

875
00:43:48,468 --> 00:43:51,293
Sheep number 13.

876
00:43:51,698 --> 00:43:53,881
Then let's get a divorce.

877
00:43:53,898 --> 00:43:56,237
Fine, let's do that. Let's get a divorce!

878
00:43:56,238 --> 00:43:58,145
Darn it. This is crazy.

879
00:43:58,508 --> 00:44:01,741
I can't just leave. What am I supposed to do?

880
00:44:03,148 --> 00:44:04,648
Mom, I'm home.

881
00:44:06,948 --> 00:44:08,040
Who are you?

882
00:44:09,088 --> 00:44:10,893
I sell cars.

883
00:44:11,019 --> 00:44:13,129
I stopped by because your mom wants to buy a car.

884
00:44:15,858 --> 00:44:17,735
Mom! Mom!

885
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:21,268
- What is it? - I have to do my homework.

886
00:44:21,269 --> 00:44:22,427
Can you help me with it?

887
00:44:22,428 --> 00:44:24,101
What? Your homework?

888
00:44:25,198 --> 00:44:28,533
Excuse me. I'm sorry to ask you this, but can you help him?

889
00:44:28,608 --> 00:44:29,868
Sorry? Me?

890
00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:33,337
I can't sign the contract until I finish this talk with my husband.

891
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:34,470
Do you not want to sell the car?

892
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:37,348
No, it's not that. I'll help him.

893
00:44:37,749 --> 00:44:38,972
Get back to your conversation, ma'am.

894
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:46,099
This is driving me crazy.

895
00:44:49,928 --> 00:44:52,377
Kid, what's your homework?

896
00:44:56,898 --> 00:44:59,337
I have to make something with these sorghum straws.

897
00:44:59,338 --> 00:45:00,358
Well...

898
00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:03,982
What do you need to make with these?

899
00:45:06,709 --> 00:45:08,953
Please make this for me.

900
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:12,887
You want me to make that with these sticks?

901
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:14,018
Can I make something else?

902
00:45:14,019 --> 00:45:17,147
No! I want you to make this!

903
00:45:17,148 --> 00:45:18,851
Make this for me!

904
00:45:19,588 --> 00:45:21,958
- Make this for me! - Fine, fine.

905
00:45:21,959 --> 00:45:24,304
- I'll make it for you. - Are you sure?

906
00:45:32,269 --> 00:45:34,002
Almost there.

907
00:45:42,148 --> 00:45:43,944
Is there anything to wash...

908
00:45:45,019 --> 00:45:47,618
Why are you out of your bed again?

909
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:50,418
Well, I wanted to look in the mirror.

910
00:45:50,419 --> 00:45:52,217
Why would you look in the mirror when you're injured?

911
00:45:52,218 --> 00:45:54,299
You're just ugly as usual.

912
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:56,485
Let me carry you to the bed again.

913
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:00,752
Watch your back.

914
00:46:01,128 --> 00:46:02,700
- Be careful. - All right.

915
00:46:04,769 --> 00:46:06,197
1, 2, 3.

916
00:46:06,738 --> 00:46:08,033
Gosh, my back!

917
00:46:08,709 --> 00:46:10,503
My bottom!

918
00:46:11,278 --> 00:46:14,094
How much do you weigh, really? You're heavy like a rock.

919
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:15,474
- What? - Never mind.

920
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:17,713
Come here. Let's try again.

921
00:46:18,979 --> 00:46:20,304
I can't straighten my body.

922
00:46:20,718 --> 00:46:21,840
Come here.

923
00:46:22,048 --> 00:46:23,375
1, 2...

924
00:46:24,988 --> 00:46:26,110
Gosh.

925
00:46:30,928 --> 00:46:32,197
Where's the note?

926
00:46:32,198 --> 00:46:35,127
Jung Eun, stay right here in your bed from now on,

927
00:46:35,128 --> 00:46:37,427
- okay? - Okay. Go out now.

928
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:39,947
You're an enemy, not a friend.

929
00:46:44,738 --> 00:46:45,901
What?

930
00:46:46,909 --> 00:46:48,030
How did that end up there?

931
00:46:50,178 --> 00:46:52,320
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

932
00:46:53,718 --> 00:46:56,912
Sir, I want the turtle ship...

933
00:46:57,249 --> 00:46:58,513
to belch fire.

934
00:46:58,959 --> 00:47:00,040
Fire?

935
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:03,627
Okay. I'll do my best.

936
00:47:04,028 --> 00:47:05,120
I'm home.

937
00:47:06,428 --> 00:47:07,927
What's going on? Who are you?

938
00:47:08,568 --> 00:47:10,057
I'm a car dealer.

939
00:47:10,169 --> 00:47:11,871
Your mom wants to buy a car.

940
00:47:12,169 --> 00:47:13,596
I see.

941
00:47:13,869 --> 00:47:15,440
- Where are M and D? - "M and D"?

942
00:47:15,809 --> 00:47:17,677
- What do you mean? - Mom and Dad.

943
00:47:17,678 --> 00:47:19,922
- M and D. - Mom and Dad?

944
00:47:19,979 --> 00:47:22,047
Is there anything you've done for me?

945
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:24,147
- They're fighting again? - What are you talking about?

946
00:47:24,148 --> 00:47:25,848
Gosh, I can't believe this family.

947
00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:27,377
It's a total mess.

948
00:47:27,378 --> 00:47:29,867
- MLF. - "MLF"?

949
00:47:30,548 --> 00:47:32,599
My life is a failure.

950
00:47:32,689 --> 00:47:34,148
I was already having a bad day.

951
00:47:34,389 --> 00:47:36,673
- Gosh. - Hey.

952
00:47:36,988 --> 00:47:38,283
Hey.

953
00:47:38,729 --> 00:47:40,799
- Where are you going? - I'm going to run away.

954
00:47:41,169 --> 00:47:43,983
You're going to run away? Why?

955
00:47:44,068 --> 00:47:45,496
Tell me why you're running away.

956
00:47:47,068 --> 00:47:49,638
So your best friend...

957
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:52,277
had an ice cream with another girl at the cafeteria...

958
00:47:52,278 --> 00:47:54,138
without you knowing?

959
00:47:54,139 --> 00:47:56,250
Yes. Isn't that such a bummer?

960
00:47:56,349 --> 00:47:57,947
What's worse,

961
00:47:57,948 --> 00:48:00,478
after third period, they went to the bathroom together...

962
00:48:00,479 --> 00:48:02,865
without telling me.

963
00:48:03,189 --> 00:48:04,514
- Gosh. - What...

964
00:48:04,988 --> 00:48:06,587
What's so bad about them going to the bathroom together?

965
00:48:06,588 --> 00:48:09,627
- Don't you see how serious this is? - Is it that serious?

966
00:48:09,628 --> 00:48:12,357
Look at this. I knew it.

967
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:14,828
- GDU. NTYA. - What?

968
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:17,098
Grown-ups don't understand.

969
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:19,237
I'm not talking to you anymore.

970
00:48:19,238 --> 00:48:20,998
I'm going to run away.

971
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:23,408
- Don't stop me! - I'm sorry.

972
00:48:23,409 --> 00:48:25,377
Make me a turtle ship.

973
00:48:25,608 --> 00:48:28,607
Just a second. Your sister is running away.

974
00:48:29,108 --> 00:48:30,708
Let go of me!

975
00:48:30,709 --> 00:48:32,918
- Make me a turtle ship! - Let go of me!

976
00:48:32,919 --> 00:48:35,438
- I'm running away! - You shouldn't run away like this!

977
00:48:36,948 --> 00:48:39,509
Who would have thought he'd start counting sheep?

978
00:48:40,258 --> 00:48:42,605
If I doze off again, I might really get fired.

979
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:45,648
This time, I have to stay awake.

980
00:48:46,099 --> 00:48:47,180
No matter what.

981
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:49,797
Let's start the interview again.

982
00:48:49,798 --> 00:48:51,472
Cue.

983
00:48:52,439 --> 00:48:56,519
So you have 95 sheep.

984
00:48:56,939 --> 00:49:00,277
Your sheep have especially shiny fur and look very healthy.

985
00:49:00,278 --> 00:49:01,981
What's the secret?

986
00:49:02,778 --> 00:49:04,716
The secret?

987
00:49:07,218 --> 00:49:10,043
I do have...

988
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:12,288
a secret.

989
00:49:12,289 --> 00:49:14,431
Really? What is it?

990
00:49:22,568 --> 00:49:26,516
What? He plays the harp for his sheep?

991
00:49:31,409 --> 00:49:33,449
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

992
00:49:34,439 --> 00:49:37,132
The sound of the harp is making me drowsier and drowsier.

993
00:49:38,619 --> 00:49:40,923
All right. I have no choice.

994
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:11,233
♪ Billie Jean

995
00:50:11,234 --> 00:50:12,662
♪ Not my love

996
00:50:13,535 --> 00:50:16,360
♪ Billie Jean, not my love

997
00:50:17,604 --> 00:50:19,104
I don't seem to age at all.

998
00:50:20,174 --> 00:50:22,756
♪ Billie Jean, Billie Jean...

999
00:50:28,285 --> 00:50:29,467
What are you doing right now?

1000
00:50:31,254 --> 00:50:34,621
Why are you here in that condition?

1001
00:50:35,254 --> 00:50:38,763
I smelled the ramyeon. I want some too.

1002
00:50:39,754 --> 00:50:40,876
What?

1003
00:50:47,095 --> 00:50:50,021
How could you crave ramyeon in this situation?

1004
00:50:50,404 --> 00:50:52,516
I can't believe you.

1005
00:50:53,904 --> 00:50:55,067
Tell me the truth.

1006
00:50:55,345 --> 00:50:56,629
Are you just pretending to be injured?

1007
00:50:57,044 --> 00:50:59,116
- No. - Forget it.

1008
00:50:59,745 --> 00:51:01,173
I'll go back to reading my script.

1009
00:51:02,544 --> 00:51:03,871
What should I do?

1010
00:51:03,944 --> 00:51:05,688
Jun Ki should never see that note.

1011
00:51:05,754 --> 00:51:07,448
Jun Ki, hold on.

1012
00:51:07,484 --> 00:51:08,606
What is it now?

1013
00:51:08,685 --> 00:51:11,551
What's your opinion on reducing the screen quotas?

1014
00:51:12,154 --> 00:51:13,246
What?

1015
00:51:13,924 --> 00:51:15,193
Why are you asking me?

1016
00:51:15,194 --> 00:51:17,824
We work in the movie industry. We should all think about it.

1017
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:18,894
Don't you agree?

1018
00:51:18,895 --> 00:51:20,629
Have a seat. Come.

1019
00:51:21,165 --> 00:51:23,582
This is ridiculous. I can't believe her.

1020
00:51:27,575 --> 00:51:29,380
Tell me. What are your thoughts?

1021
00:51:30,674 --> 00:51:31,796
Well...

1022
00:51:33,444 --> 00:51:36,474
Screen quotas are necessary to protect the Korean movie industry.

1023
00:51:37,685 --> 00:51:41,554
Why am I living with a man who won't even let me buy a car?

1024
00:51:41,555 --> 00:51:44,757
Then why don't you go back to your first love?

1025
00:51:45,694 --> 00:51:47,387
You shouldn't run away.

1026
00:51:47,895 --> 00:51:50,107
Your parents will be so worried.

1027
00:51:51,194 --> 00:51:55,141
Sir, I want the turtle ship to have sharp horns.

1028
00:51:55,265 --> 00:51:56,560
Hurry up!

1029
00:51:56,634 --> 00:51:59,256
I get it. I'm making them right now.

1030
00:51:59,435 --> 00:52:00,658
I'm home.

1031
00:52:00,935 --> 00:52:02,025
Who's that boy?

1032
00:52:02,575 --> 00:52:03,773
There's another kid?

1033
00:52:03,774 --> 00:52:06,222
What's going on? Su Jin, who's that guy?

1034
00:52:06,515 --> 00:52:07,574
He's a CD.

1035
00:52:07,575 --> 00:52:09,319
Oh, a car dealer?

1036
00:52:09,544 --> 00:52:11,284
What is he doing here?

1037
00:52:11,285 --> 00:52:13,184
- MWBC. - MRWBC?

1038
00:52:13,185 --> 00:52:14,454
TWMDF.

1039
00:52:14,455 --> 00:52:15,983
- MDFA? - What are they talking about?

1040
00:52:15,984 --> 00:52:18,753
I need to talk to Mom and Dad about my university applications.

1041
00:52:18,754 --> 00:52:20,353
Whatever, I don't care about university.

1042
00:52:20,354 --> 00:52:21,721
I'll just give up.

1043
00:52:22,395 --> 00:52:24,262
Hey, stop!

1044
00:52:25,234 --> 00:52:28,224
Why would you give up on going to university? You should go.

1045
00:52:29,064 --> 00:52:30,204
Talk to me.

1046
00:52:30,205 --> 00:52:32,142
Which university are you interested in?

1047
00:52:33,875 --> 00:52:35,985
This is the university I'm interested in.

1048
00:52:36,145 --> 00:52:38,664
But my grades are just above three. It won't be easy.

1049
00:52:38,714 --> 00:52:40,143
I see.

1050
00:52:40,444 --> 00:52:42,964
The thing is, I've always loved webtoons.

1051
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,713
I'd love to go to an art school.

1052
00:52:44,884 --> 00:52:46,751
But I guess it's too late now.

1053
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,178
What should I do?

1054
00:52:48,955 --> 00:52:50,617
Well...

1055
00:52:51,185 --> 00:52:53,853
I think you should choose what you really want to do.

1056
00:52:53,854 --> 00:52:56,038
I'm asking you because I'm not sure what it is.

1057
00:52:56,095 --> 00:52:57,625
Can't you be more serious?

1058
00:52:58,134 --> 00:52:59,215
Sorry.

1059
00:52:59,464 --> 00:53:01,852
What am I doing here?

1060
00:53:02,504 --> 00:53:06,106
Does she want the car or not?

1061
00:53:07,575 --> 00:53:09,441
Guys, just a second.

1062
00:53:18,455 --> 00:53:19,514
Ma'am.

1063
00:53:19,515 --> 00:53:22,543
Fine, I'll give up on that car.

1064
00:53:22,924 --> 00:53:25,066
I'm so disappointed in you.

1065
00:53:28,895 --> 00:53:30,660
Why are you crying?

1066
00:53:31,665 --> 00:53:32,787
My goodness.

1067
00:53:34,964 --> 00:53:37,994
It's just that I'm worried about you.

1068
00:53:38,834 --> 00:53:41,528
What if you get in an accident while driving?

1069
00:53:41,745 --> 00:53:44,151
You know I can't live without you.

1070
00:53:44,674 --> 00:53:47,326
What? Was that what this was all about?

1071
00:53:48,044 --> 00:53:50,187
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1072
00:53:50,245 --> 00:53:52,294
- Honey. - Mi Jeong.

1073
00:53:59,095 --> 00:54:01,023
What was that? Gosh.

1074
00:54:01,024 --> 00:54:03,339
What's wrong? What happened to M and D?

1075
00:54:04,395 --> 00:54:06,233
Guys, KDNTK.

1076
00:54:06,234 --> 00:54:07,459
Just GTB!

1077
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:09,963
- GTB! - What's KDNTK and GTB?

1078
00:54:09,964 --> 00:54:12,034
KDNTK. Kids don't need to know.

1079
00:54:12,035 --> 00:54:14,145
GTB. Go to bed!

1080
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:15,543
GTB. GTB!

1081
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:17,403
- What about my turtle ship? - I have to run away from home!

1082
00:54:17,404 --> 00:54:18,614
- My admission counseling! - My turtle ship!

1083
00:54:18,615 --> 00:54:19,673
Quiet! GTB.

1084
00:54:19,674 --> 00:54:20,813
- GTB! - My admission counseling!

1085
00:54:20,814 --> 00:54:23,262
- Come on! - GTB!

1086
00:54:26,055 --> 00:54:27,544
That was hectic.

1087
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:32,102
I see why they have so many kids.

1088
00:54:32,225 --> 00:54:33,622
What a surprise!

1089
00:54:38,794 --> 00:54:41,283
How was it?

1090
00:54:42,265 --> 00:54:48,304
Did you enjoy...

1091
00:54:48,305 --> 00:54:51,231
Yes. It was really good.

1092
00:54:52,115 --> 00:54:56,093
No wonder they're married. They talk the same way.

1093
00:54:57,245 --> 00:54:58,816
I'm so tired.

1094
00:54:59,814 --> 00:55:02,375
How did you two meet?

1095
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:03,710
I went...

1096
00:55:05,555 --> 00:55:09,441
to her concert...

1097
00:55:09,865 --> 00:55:14,455
and fell in love...

1098
00:55:14,765 --> 00:55:19,977
with her singing.

1099
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,108
What did she sing?

1100
00:55:26,174 --> 00:55:28,184
Should I...

1101
00:55:29,145 --> 00:55:35,753
sing it for you?

1102
00:55:35,754 --> 00:55:36,947
Now?

1103
00:55:44,765 --> 00:55:47,243
What? Isn't this a lullaby?

1104
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,532
Why did it have to be this song?

1105
00:55:57,305 --> 00:55:58,396
I'm sleepy.

1106
00:55:59,075 --> 00:56:00,339
I'm so sleepy.

1107
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,376
It's driving me crazy.

1108
00:56:03,314 --> 00:56:04,437
What do I do?

1109
00:56:53,694 --> 00:56:55,133
Today, we have looked into the life of...

1110
00:56:55,134 --> 00:56:57,613
the world renowned conductor, Park Chul Hong.

1111
00:56:57,834 --> 00:57:00,233
Hoping they live happily ever after,

1112
00:57:00,234 --> 00:57:02,403
this was Han Soo Yeon of Report Special Force.

1113
00:57:02,404 --> 00:57:04,173
Cut! Okay.

1114
00:57:04,174 --> 00:57:05,501
We will wrap up here.

1115
00:57:06,314 --> 00:57:08,344
- Good job. - Good job.

1116
00:57:08,345 --> 00:57:09,365
Good job.

1117
00:57:09,415 --> 00:57:11,180
How does it feel to have finished your first shoot?

1118
00:57:11,714 --> 00:57:14,102
I'm sorry I made so many mistakes.

1119
00:57:14,955 --> 00:57:18,394
I feel really good about it, though.

1120
00:57:18,395 --> 00:57:19,720
- Do you? - Sure!

1121
00:57:20,095 --> 00:57:22,746
I feel like I could fly.

1122
00:57:23,024 --> 00:57:24,116
Want to see?

1123
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:38,295
What's happening?

1124
00:57:39,475 --> 00:57:41,515
Am I really flying?

1125
00:57:46,915 --> 00:57:47,976
That can't be it.

1126
00:58:10,944 --> 00:58:13,414
Of course, it would be great if we could do huge projects...

1127
00:58:13,415 --> 00:58:16,169
like Marvel Cinematic Universe to take action against Hollywood,

1128
00:58:16,185 --> 00:58:18,083
but considering the film market in Korea,

1129
00:58:18,084 --> 00:58:20,297
the profits won't be as... Wait.

1130
00:58:21,584 --> 00:58:23,224
Why am I saying this to you?

1131
00:58:23,225 --> 00:58:25,743
Why? It's such a constructive and useful opinion.

1132
00:58:25,754 --> 00:58:26,918
Whatever!

1133
00:58:27,395 --> 00:58:29,435
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

1134
00:58:31,095 --> 00:58:33,848
What do I do? I can't just let him go.

1135
00:58:34,035 --> 00:58:35,333
Jun Ki! Wait!

1136
00:58:35,334 --> 00:58:37,069
What is it this time?

1137
00:58:37,464 --> 00:58:40,667
Can you grab that stuffed animal for me?

1138
00:58:40,904 --> 00:58:43,016
I can't sleep without it.

1139
00:58:43,575 --> 00:58:45,206
That doesn't even suit you.

1140
00:58:45,274 --> 00:58:46,397
All right.

1141
00:58:55,084 --> 00:58:56,350
(Lee Jun Ki, I have feelings for him?)

1142
00:58:57,524 --> 00:58:59,361
Oh gosh!

1143
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:01,381
What are you doing? Why did you touch my butt?

1144
00:59:02,024 --> 00:59:04,003
It's just...

1145
00:59:04,794 --> 00:59:07,141
I know my butt looks good, but still.

1146
00:59:07,895 --> 00:59:09,026
What's that in your hand?

1147
00:59:09,165 --> 00:59:10,226
What?

1148
00:59:12,435 --> 00:59:13,496
Hey.

1149
00:59:14,334 --> 00:59:16,242
What do you think you're doing?

1150
00:59:17,305 --> 00:59:18,914
Why did you eat it?

1151
00:59:18,915 --> 00:59:20,199
Hey, hey!

1152
00:59:20,915 --> 00:59:22,413
Hey, give it!

1153
00:59:22,415 --> 00:59:23,435
What is this?

1154
00:59:23,944 --> 00:59:25,514
No, don't!

1155
00:59:25,515 --> 00:59:27,013
- No, don't! - Leave me alone! What is it?

1156
00:59:37,325 --> 00:59:38,345
Jung Eun.

1157
00:59:39,964 --> 00:59:41,699
How could you...

1158
00:59:42,935 --> 00:59:45,760
Listen. It's...

1159
00:59:47,174 --> 00:59:48,574
"Lee Jun Ki, crazy fool"?

1160
00:59:48,575 --> 00:59:50,278
What? What are you talking about?

1161
00:59:50,444 --> 00:59:52,414
Is swearing out loud not enough for you?

1162
00:59:52,774 --> 00:59:55,672
Did you have to write it out on paper...

1163
00:59:56,285 --> 00:59:59,988
and stick it on my butt?

1164
01:00:00,854 --> 01:00:02,109
What do you mean, swear?

1165
01:00:02,285 --> 01:00:04,090
Whatever, you mean witch.

1166
01:00:05,125 --> 01:00:06,725
What is he talking about?

1167
01:00:11,325 --> 01:00:12,333
(Lee Jun Ki, crazy fool)

1168
01:00:12,334 --> 01:00:13,794
What's this?

1169
01:00:16,305 --> 01:00:18,704
What? Jung Eun cursed at you?

1170
01:00:18,705 --> 01:00:20,062
That's what I'm saying!

1171
01:00:20,104 --> 01:00:22,874
She wrote on paper, "Lee Jun Ki, crazy fool" and so on...

1172
01:00:22,875 --> 01:00:24,272
and stuck it on my butt!

1173
01:00:24,944 --> 01:00:27,943
Stop harassing her, then.

1174
01:00:27,944 --> 01:00:30,056
How annoyed must she have gotten?

1175
01:00:31,785 --> 01:00:32,875
Do you think so?

1176
01:00:35,384 --> 01:00:38,311
Why aren't the rest coming? It's getting late.

1177
01:00:55,674 --> 01:00:58,374
(Sheep Farm)

1178
01:00:58,375 --> 01:01:00,966
What? You fell asleep during the interview?

1179
01:01:01,984 --> 01:01:03,311
Exactly.

1180
01:01:03,745 --> 01:01:05,653
But even the producer...

1181
01:01:05,654 --> 01:01:07,318
and the staff all fell asleep.

1182
01:01:07,654 --> 01:01:09,318
So I didn't get in that much trouble.

1183
01:01:09,984 --> 01:01:11,045
That's good to hear.

1184
01:01:11,995 --> 01:01:13,994
Anyways, thanks for picking me up.

1185
01:01:13,995 --> 01:01:15,453
No problem.

1186
01:01:15,694 --> 01:01:18,071
I already told you, I was right around the corner.

1187
01:01:18,395 --> 01:01:20,607
But still.

1188
01:01:21,194 --> 01:01:24,333
I was wondering how I would get home at this hour.

1189
01:01:24,334 --> 01:01:25,559
You saved me.

1190
01:01:26,535 --> 01:01:28,951
I'll buy you some food at the rest stop on the way home.

1191
01:01:29,305 --> 01:01:30,803
What do you want to eat, Woo Shik?

1192
01:01:33,915 --> 01:01:34,935
Woo Shik?

1193
01:01:37,484 --> 01:01:38,739
He fell asleep.

1194
01:01:49,294 --> 01:01:51,029
Woo Shik? You have a phone call.

1195
01:01:53,694 --> 01:01:54,786
Woo Shik?

1196
01:02:00,705 --> 01:02:01,857
Hello?

1197
01:02:03,044 --> 01:02:04,677
Yes, this is Woo Shik's phone.

1198
01:02:05,544 --> 01:02:08,166
He can't answer the phone right now.

1199
01:02:08,345 --> 01:02:09,583
What is it?

1200
01:02:09,584 --> 01:02:12,307
Woo Shik left his clothes at the event hall.

1201
01:02:12,515 --> 01:02:15,717
Please tell him that I left it with the information desk...

1202
01:02:15,785 --> 01:02:17,023
at the lobby of Gangnam Wedding Hall.

1203
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:18,279
Oh, all right...

1204
01:02:19,455 --> 01:02:20,577
Wait.

1205
01:02:20,924 --> 01:02:22,831
What do you mean, Gangnam Wedding Hall?

1206
01:02:23,194 --> 01:02:25,463
Was the event held in Gangnam?

1207
01:02:25,464 --> 01:02:27,811
Yes. Why do you ask?

1208
01:02:30,564 --> 01:02:33,971
It's nothing. I'll let him know.

1209
01:02:34,774 --> 01:02:35,826
Thank you.

1210
01:02:48,685 --> 01:02:50,969
He said he was right around the corner.

1211
01:03:27,854 --> 01:03:31,261
(Sheep Farm)

1212
01:03:47,544 --> 01:03:50,094
(Welcome to Waikiki 2 / Eulachacha Waikiki 2)

1213
01:03:50,714 --> 01:03:52,514
I was chosen to play in "Challenge! King of Quiz".

1214
01:03:52,515 --> 01:03:54,383
- What? - The prize is 400 million dollars?

1215
01:03:54,384 --> 01:03:56,624
- Why did it have to be this fool? - Pass!

1216
01:03:56,625 --> 01:03:58,324
Kook Ki Bong, who passed all the questions,

1217
01:03:58,325 --> 01:03:59,624
is the final contestant!

1218
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:00,853
Let's go!

1219
01:04:00,854 --> 01:04:02,094
Don't forget to take this, Jun Ki.

1220
01:04:02,095 --> 01:04:03,563
How long has it been since I last got a present?

1221
01:04:03,564 --> 01:04:05,193
What if I become a star?

1222
01:04:05,194 --> 01:04:08,364
What happened? Don't you know kids all over the country watch our show?

1223
01:04:08,365 --> 01:04:10,781
The first guy cuffed himself.

1224
01:04:10,834 --> 01:04:12,304
Shouldn't we throw a welcome party for Soo Yeon?

1225
01:04:12,305 --> 01:04:14,974
The main writer needs me, so I should get going.

1226
01:04:14,975 --> 01:04:17,103
Soo Yeon, you're quite drunk.

1227
01:04:17,104 --> 01:04:18,503
Your diction is bad.

1228
01:04:18,504 --> 01:04:19,914
You can't even spell,

1229
01:04:19,915 --> 01:04:21,644
and you don't have good drinking manners.

1230
01:04:21,645 --> 01:04:24,213
Is there anything that you can do?

1231
01:04:24,214 --> 01:04:26,805
Enough, you jerk!
