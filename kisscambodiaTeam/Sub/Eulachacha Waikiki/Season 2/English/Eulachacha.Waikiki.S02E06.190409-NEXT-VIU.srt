00:00:11,002 --> 00:00:17,336
Love is hurting me again

2
00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:19,502
Love is

3
00:00:19,503 --> 00:00:21,572
Stop. I told you that's not it.

4
00:00:21,573 --> 00:00:25,451
This song requires a softer voice between your head and nose.

5
00:00:25,883 --> 00:00:27,701
I said you must sing using your forehead.

6
00:00:28,113 --> 00:00:30,651
Love is...

7
00:00:30,652 --> 00:00:33,181
Softer, softer voice.

8
00:00:33,182 --> 00:00:34,738
What's so hard about this?

9
00:00:35,292 --> 00:00:37,291
- Try it. - Love is...

10
00:00:37,292 --> 00:00:39,192
Stop! Do you think singing is a joke?

11
00:00:39,193 --> 00:00:41,313
How could you call yourself a singer? Just quit.

12
00:00:43,093 --> 00:00:45,627
Hey, stop it. He's crying.

13
00:00:46,432 --> 00:00:48,088
- Go get some fresh air. - Okay.

14
00:00:49,102 --> 00:00:50,143
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:53,142 --> 00:00:54,611
You should go easy on him.

16
00:00:54,612 --> 00:00:57,482
Don't you know there are rumors that you're an evil trainer?

17
00:00:57,483 --> 00:00:59,229
I don't know about anything else, but...

18
00:00:59,343 --> 00:01:01,535
I can't stand people singing insincerely.

19
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:02,811
You know that too.

20
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,570
You haven't changed a bit.

21
00:01:04,883 --> 00:01:07,518
Right, since I'm here, can you check my singing?

22
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:08,991
My voice keeps going out of tune.

23
00:01:08,992 --> 00:01:10,002
Really?

24
00:01:10,563 --> 00:01:12,481
All right, start singing.

25
00:01:16,462 --> 00:01:22,132
Those common words that I love you

26
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:27,728
I never got to say them to you

27
00:01:27,742 --> 00:01:32,511
I felt upset on my own

28
00:01:32,512 --> 00:01:34,151
Stop, stop!

29
00:01:34,152 --> 00:01:36,638
How could you be so bad at singing with all that experience?

30
00:01:36,682 --> 00:01:38,752
Is shouting at the top of your lungs singing?

31
00:01:38,753 --> 00:01:41,922
I can't feel that passion that touches my heart.

32
00:01:41,923 --> 00:01:43,052
Oh, really?

33
00:01:43,053 --> 00:01:44,662
And why do you keep shaking your hands?

34
00:01:44,663 --> 00:01:45,862
Do you have hand tremor or what?

35
00:01:45,863 --> 00:01:47,591
What on earth is this?

36
00:01:47,592 --> 00:01:48,632
Do you sing with your hands?

37
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:50,582
Why don't you stick a microphone on your hand too?

38
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:54,172
Even you're a singer, and I'm training little kids.

39
00:01:54,173 --> 00:01:55,486
Don't you think it's unfair?

40
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:57,389
I hate this darn world!

41
00:02:03,313 --> 00:02:08,302
(The Nice Guy Never Seen Anywhere In The World)

42
00:02:14,223 --> 00:02:15,607
It's our yearbook.

43
00:02:15,993 --> 00:02:18,122
How long has it been?

44
00:02:18,123 --> 00:02:19,678
This reminds me of the old days.

45
00:02:20,693 --> 00:02:24,975
It's me. My skin was so firm and I was beautiful back then.

46
00:02:26,003 --> 00:02:27,144
I see.

47
00:02:28,072 --> 00:02:30,231
By the way, was there anyone that you liked?

48
00:02:30,232 --> 00:02:31,282
What?

49
00:02:31,572 --> 00:02:33,896
There was someone I liked.

50
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,487
Actually...

51
00:02:37,072 --> 00:02:39,011
Woo Shik was my first love.

52
00:02:39,012 --> 00:02:41,103
- Why? - Because he was nice.

53
00:02:41,512 --> 00:02:44,882
No matter what anyone said, he never got angry and put on a goofy smile.

54
00:02:44,883 --> 00:02:46,321
Woo Shik was nice?

55
00:02:46,322 --> 00:02:48,122
That crankiest guy in the world?

56
00:02:48,123 --> 00:02:50,592
He seems to have changed a bit,

57
00:02:50,593 --> 00:02:52,309
but he was really nice before.

58
00:02:52,493 --> 00:02:55,159
Maybe it's because I'm mean. I like nice guys.

59
00:02:55,663 --> 00:02:57,662
Oh, you have to keep this a secret.

60
00:02:57,663 --> 00:02:58,861
Okay.

61
00:02:58,862 --> 00:03:01,201
Let's keep cleaning, before Woo Shik starts to nag us.

62
00:03:01,202 --> 00:03:02,343
Okay.

63
00:03:02,802 --> 00:03:05,297
Since we're almost done here, let's go upstairs now.

64
00:03:14,452 --> 00:03:15,928
Is that so?

65
00:03:17,922 --> 00:03:20,051
Hey, where is everyone?

66
00:03:20,052 --> 00:03:22,521
I bought this a few days ago.

67
00:03:22,522 --> 00:03:24,421
Who broke this?

68
00:03:24,422 --> 00:03:25,504
Brother.

69
00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:27,374
You be quiet!

70
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:29,692
Oh, you're the one who did this, aren't you?

71
00:03:29,693 --> 00:03:30,976
Am I right? Tell me!

72
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:32,749
Goodness, I told you to be quiet!

73
00:03:33,332 --> 00:03:34,444
What?

74
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,486
What is wrong with you?

75
00:03:39,243 --> 00:03:42,972
Brother, I just overheard Jung Eun and Soo Yeon talking.

76
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:46,081
I heard Soo Yeon's ideal type is a nice guy.

77
00:03:46,082 --> 00:03:48,001
- A nice guy? - Yes.

78
00:03:48,082 --> 00:03:50,252
She liked you before because you were nice.

79
00:03:50,253 --> 00:03:52,152
You never got angry, and always smiled.

80
00:03:52,153 --> 00:03:53,900
Oh, I see.

81
00:03:54,253 --> 00:03:55,421
So what?

82
00:03:55,422 --> 00:03:56,992
You're a slow-witted idiot, aren't you?

83
00:03:56,993 --> 00:03:59,162
I told you Soo Yeon's ideal type is a nice guy.

84
00:03:59,163 --> 00:04:02,492
If you throw a fit to find the person who broke this broom,

85
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:04,381
- will she like that or not? - She won't.

86
00:04:05,332 --> 00:04:06,701
Then what do you have to do now?

87
00:04:06,702 --> 00:04:08,271
Should I stop looking for the person who broke the broom?

88
00:04:08,272 --> 00:04:09,282
Or...

89
00:04:09,302 --> 00:04:10,502
Shall I buy a new broom?

90
00:04:10,503 --> 00:04:11,755
You idiot.

91
00:04:12,142 --> 00:04:13,416
Why did you just hit me?

92
00:04:17,613 --> 00:04:20,340
So you're saying, you cooked all this food?

93
00:04:20,642 --> 00:04:22,501
- What's the occasion? - No reason.

94
00:04:22,712 --> 00:04:26,422
You guys seem tired lately, so I just cooked for you.

95
00:04:26,423 --> 00:04:28,472
Oh, my. You did?

96
00:04:28,592 --> 00:04:32,122
Woo Shik, you're such a nice guy.

97
00:04:32,123 --> 00:04:33,305
Right, Soo Yeon?

98
00:04:33,762 --> 00:04:36,157
What? Oh, yes.

99
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,990
Come on. It's not even a big deal.

100
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:40,562
Go on and eat.

101
00:04:40,563 --> 00:04:41,872
Ki Bong, can you pass me the water?

102
00:04:41,873 --> 00:04:43,215
Water? Sure.

103
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,511
- That's so cold! - I'm sorry, Woo Shik.

104
00:04:47,512 --> 00:04:48,553
You crazy...

105
00:04:53,383 --> 00:04:54,565
It's fine.

106
00:04:55,353 --> 00:04:59,321
I was burning up from the cooking anyway. This feels so cool.

107
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:00,821
Eat up, I'm fine.

108
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:02,891
Still, I should wipe this for you.

109
00:05:02,892 --> 00:05:03,933
No, I'll do it.

110
00:05:04,923 --> 00:05:06,033
That's so hot!

111
00:05:06,722 --> 00:05:08,132
Woo Shik!

112
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:10,182
I'm really sorry. Calm down.

113
00:05:11,303 --> 00:05:12,474
You little punk...

114
00:05:16,603 --> 00:05:18,218
It's fine.

115
00:05:19,303 --> 00:05:21,494
It feels cool and hot at the same time, and I like it.

116
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,784
I'm okay. Go on and eat.

117
00:05:26,412 --> 00:05:28,372
We all spill soup, right?

- Hello, I'm Lee Jun Ki. - Hello.

- The smell of the set. - Goodness.

00:05:43,332 --> 00:05:44,932
How have you managed to refrain yourself all this time?

123
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:47,201
Jun Ki, do you think I can do this?

124
00:05:47,202 --> 00:05:48,802
You'll be fine, don't worry.

125
00:05:48,803 --> 00:05:51,469
Don't get nervous, and just do as you practiced.

Jung Eun, what are you doing?

135
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:40,922
Your voice sounds like a robot.

136

Can't you raise the tension more?

137
00:06:42,553 --> 00:06:43,651
I'm sorry!

154

- Jun Ki. - Hey, how was my acting today?

160
00:07:47,753 --> 00:07:49,813
- What did the director say? - I don't even know.

161
00:07:49,993 --> 00:07:51,062
What's with your friend?

162
00:07:51,063 --> 00:07:52,305
You said she can act well.

163
00:07:53,293 --> 00:07:55,432
She was just nervous because she hadn't done it for a long time.

164
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,261
- I'm sure she'll do a great job. - It's too late.

165
00:07:57,262 --> 00:07:58,950
The director wants to replace her.

166
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:01,223
Wait, he wants to replace her?

167
00:08:01,402 --> 00:08:02,715
So Jung Eun got fired?

168
00:08:03,072 --> 00:08:05,830
- Come on. That's not fair. - Whatever, I don't care.

169
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,093
Anyway, she's your friend, so you'll have to break the news to her.

170
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,896
Hey, wait. Hey! Gosh.

171
00:08:12,012 --> 00:08:13,153
Darn it. What is this mess?

172
00:08:13,943 --> 00:08:15,164
This is crazy.

173
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:17,334
Jun Ki, did I keep you waiting long?

174
00:08:18,152 --> 00:08:19,900
No, it's fine.

175
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:22,039
I made too many mistakes today, didn't I?

176
00:08:22,322 --> 00:08:24,292
I haven't done it in a long time, so it's hard.

177
00:08:24,293 --> 00:08:26,261
Jung Eun, the thing is...

178
00:08:26,262 --> 00:08:28,918
But you know what? I was so happy today.

179
00:08:29,032 --> 00:08:30,103
What?

180
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:31,413
Thanks so much.

181
00:08:31,603 --> 00:08:34,056
Without you, I wouldn't have been able to get back into acting.

00:08:34,062 --> 00:08:35,872
- What? - To show you my gratitude,

183
00:08:35,873 --> 00:08:37,286
I'll do a really good job.

184
00:08:41,142 --> 00:08:42,324
All right, sure.

185
00:08:42,912 --> 00:08:44,600
Weren't you going to say something earlier?

186
00:08:46,983 --> 00:08:49,335
No, it was nothing. Let's go.

187
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,068
Gosh, it stings.

188
00:08:57,392 --> 00:08:59,110
I put ointment on, but it still stings.

189
00:08:59,493 --> 00:09:01,661
That jerk, Ki Bong. He's so careless!

190
00:09:01,662 --> 00:09:03,450
Still, you held it in well.

191
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,832
I totally thought you'd get all angry again.

192
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,579
I was so worried.

193
00:09:07,802 --> 00:09:11,611
Anyway, you can never get angry in front of Soo Yeon. Got it?

194
00:09:11,772 --> 00:09:14,171
It's not easy.

195
00:09:14,172 --> 00:09:16,434
It's so hard. I can't do it anymore.

196
00:09:16,812 --> 00:09:18,024
I'm home.

197
00:09:18,483 --> 00:09:19,594
You're back!

198
00:09:19,782 --> 00:09:20,954
You must be tired from your shift.

199
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:24,012
- Aren't you hungry? - No, I have no appetite.

200
00:09:25,522 --> 00:09:27,099
What's wrong? Did something happen?

201
00:09:28,093 --> 00:09:31,153
During the event, I got yelled at for being a bad singer.

202
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:34,786
Hey, you should take singing lessons from Woo Shik.

203
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,408
He's a vocal trainer, you know.

204
00:09:36,562 --> 00:09:37,977
- Really? - Yes.

205
00:09:39,103 --> 00:09:41,022
Woo Shik, then can you teach me?

206
00:09:41,172 --> 00:09:42,950
What? Sure.

207
00:09:43,272 --> 00:09:45,525
- That's no problem. - Thanks, Woo Shik.

208
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,619
I'll go get changed quickly.

209
00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:53,181
What was that about? Singing lessons all of a sudden?

210
00:09:53,182 --> 00:09:55,707
Why not? It's such a good opportunity for you to score points.

211
00:09:55,953 --> 00:09:58,305
Think about it. It'll be just you and her in a room.

212
00:09:58,623 --> 00:10:01,118
You can teach her how to sing better and chat with her too.

213
00:10:01,223 --> 00:10:03,391
Then you'll kiss her, get married, and have kids with her.

214
00:10:03,392 --> 00:10:04,761
That's what everyone does.

215
00:10:04,762 --> 00:10:06,379
Gosh, that's absurd.

216
00:10:06,692 --> 00:10:08,177
Stop talking complete nonsense.

217
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,989
Woo Shik! I'm here.

218
00:10:18,503 --> 00:10:20,220
- There you are. - Yes.

219
00:10:21,373 --> 00:10:23,090
What should I do first?

220
00:10:23,942 --> 00:10:25,582
Sing a song you like. It can be anything.

221
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,997
I like IU's songs.

222
00:10:27,142 --> 00:10:29,452
My voice is quite similar to IU's.

223
00:10:29,453 --> 00:10:30,968
Oh, my. I'm excited to hear it.

224
00:10:31,012 --> 00:10:32,134
Then I'll get started.

225
00:10:37,493 --> 00:10:40,119
Tonight

226
00:10:40,392 --> 00:10:43,462
I’ll send you

227
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:46,996
The firefly

228
00:10:47,302 --> 00:10:49,572
From that day

229
00:10:49,573 --> 00:10:53,440
It means

230
00:10:53,843 --> 00:10:56,641
That I love you

231
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:01,193
How was it?

232
00:11:02,512 --> 00:11:04,441
Woo Shik, how was it?

233
00:11:05,753 --> 00:11:07,874
Oh, it was...

234
00:11:10,853 --> 00:11:12,034
It was good,

235
00:11:12,593 --> 00:11:14,161
but your voice was a little unstable,

236
00:11:14,162 --> 00:11:15,732
and you sang slightly off beat.

237
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:17,191
Your vocal range is a bit limited,

238
00:11:17,192 --> 00:11:18,677
and you ran out of breath as well.

239
00:11:19,203 --> 00:11:20,617
That's all.

240
00:11:21,032 --> 00:11:22,992
Oh, really?

241
00:11:23,603 --> 00:11:24,784
I see.

242
00:11:25,103 --> 00:11:27,940
It's fine. You can fix it.

243
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:29,183
Shall we sing each line at a time?

244
00:11:30,713 --> 00:11:33,974
Tonight, I'll send you

245
00:11:34,113 --> 00:11:38,426
The firefly from that day

246
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:42,825
- Got it? - Oh, that's how it should be sung.

247
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:44,910
Now, I totally get it thanks to your demonstration.

248
00:11:45,093 --> 00:11:47,284
- Really? Can you try again, then? - Sure.

249
00:11:49,062 --> 00:11:51,602
Tonight

250
00:11:51,603 --> 00:11:53,279
- I'll send you - Stop!

251
00:11:53,603 --> 00:11:55,794
You sound just like you did earlier. Didn't you say you got it?

252
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:58,630
What? I sang just like how you taught me.

253
00:11:59,243 --> 00:12:01,712
By the way, why are you getting all angry at me?

254
00:12:01,713 --> 00:12:03,996
What? My gosh, no.

255
00:12:04,713 --> 00:12:06,328
I'm not angry at you.

256
00:12:07,483 --> 00:12:10,714
Soo Yeon, how about we cover each measure at a time?

257
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,181
Tonight

258
00:12:14,182 --> 00:12:16,011
Tonight

259
00:12:16,353 --> 00:12:18,391
I'll send you

260
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:22,271
- I'll send you - Great. Now, sing them together.

261
00:12:22,863 --> 00:12:25,458
Tonight

262
00:12:25,603 --> 00:12:28,198
I'll send you

263
00:12:28,302 --> 00:12:31,132
The firefly

264
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:32,872
From that day

265
00:12:32,873 --> 00:12:35,398
Enough, Han Soo Yeon! Are you kidding me now?

266
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:36,572
Is singing a joke to you?

267
00:12:36,573 --> 00:12:38,158
I can't sing like that even if I try.

268
00:12:38,282 --> 00:12:40,342
And what? Your voice is similar to IU's?

269
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,212
IU will get so upset that she'll faint.

270
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:44,011
Gosh, you little...

271
00:12:44,012 --> 00:12:46,104
My gosh...

272
00:12:47,152 --> 00:12:48,234
Woo Shik.

273
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:50,565
Hey, what's wrong?

274
00:12:50,692 --> 00:12:52,278
- Why are you glaring at me? - What?

275
00:12:54,223 --> 00:12:57,222
No, I wasn't. I was just enjoying your singing.

276
00:12:57,662 --> 00:12:59,924
It was so sweet and delightful.

277
00:13:00,032 --> 00:13:01,114
Seriously?

278
00:13:01,772 --> 00:13:04,096
- Then I'll sing it again. - What?

279
00:13:05,272 --> 00:13:07,572
Tonight

280
00:13:07,573 --> 00:13:09,941
I'll send you

281
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:13,073
The firefly

282
00:13:13,182 --> 00:13:15,506
From that day

283
00:13:15,912 --> 00:13:17,882
Hey, is the lesson over?

284
00:13:17,883 --> 00:13:19,873
- How was it? Did you have fun? - Yes, Yu Ri.

285
00:13:19,983 --> 00:13:23,224
He's such a kind teacher. I think my singing has improved a lot.

286
00:13:23,623 --> 00:13:26,118
Teacher, I'll look forward to tomorrow's lesson.

287
00:13:28,262 --> 00:13:29,748
It seems like that went well.

288
00:13:33,003 --> 00:13:36,538
Brother, what's with that look on your face?

289
00:13:38,103 --> 00:13:39,254
Don't even get me started.

290
00:13:39,302 --> 00:13:41,463
I've never seen anyone who's as tone-deaf as she is.

291
00:13:42,073 --> 00:13:43,224
Tone-deaf?

292
00:13:44,642 --> 00:13:46,633
- You mean, Soo Yeon? - Yes.

293
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:49,477
She basically insulted the song she sang.

294
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,229
But do you know what's crazier?

295
00:13:51,383 --> 00:13:53,100
She doesn't even know that she's tone-deaf.

296
00:13:53,552 --> 00:13:54,967
When Soo Yeon starts singing,

297
00:13:55,192 --> 00:13:59,060
my blood begins to boil.

298
00:14:01,463 --> 00:14:03,992
I nearly started to hate her.

299
00:14:03,993 --> 00:14:05,144
Are you serious?

300
00:14:05,863 --> 00:14:07,853
How bad is her singing?

301
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:09,984
Just be patient with her.

302
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:12,193
You mustn't get angry at her no matter what.

303
00:14:12,373 --> 00:14:14,019
- Okay? - Yes, I heard you.

304
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:16,911
Are you all right? You must've been terrified.

305
00:14:16,912 --> 00:14:18,541
Are you all right? You must've been terrified.

306
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:20,330
Are you all right? You must've been terrified.

307
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,099
Which one is the best out of the three?

308
00:14:22,753 --> 00:14:23,864
What?

309
00:14:25,723 --> 00:14:27,439
I think they're all good. Yes, they're all nice.

310
00:14:27,623 --> 00:14:31,158
Really? I practiced all night, so I'm getting the hang of it again!

311
00:14:31,863 --> 00:14:33,175
I want to go to the shoot soon.

312
00:14:35,863 --> 00:14:39,437
Jung Eun, I have something to tell you.

313
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,931
Me? What is it?

314
00:14:40,932 --> 00:14:43,931
You see, movies are generally...

315
00:14:43,932 --> 00:14:46,427
- Hold on. - Hold on, okay.

316
00:14:46,642 --> 00:14:48,895
Hello? Dad!

317
00:14:49,642 --> 00:14:51,965
The shoot? I did a good job, of course.

318
00:14:52,243 --> 00:14:53,555
Don't you worry.

319
00:14:53,843 --> 00:14:56,539
This time, I certainly won't let you down.

320
00:14:57,682 --> 00:14:59,540
Why are you crying?

321
00:14:59,922 --> 00:15:01,033
Okay.

322
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:05,095
I'll invite you to the press preview when the movie comes out.

323
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:07,611
Okay. Bye.

324
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:14,050
Why? What did he say?

325
00:15:14,733 --> 00:15:16,531
Why are you crying?

326
00:15:16,532 --> 00:15:18,562
My dad is over the moon.

327
00:15:19,802 --> 00:15:21,732
It's making me cry.

328
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:27,936
By the way, didn't you say you have something to tell me?

329
00:15:28,353 --> 00:15:31,151
You got... No, never mind.

330
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:32,566
- It's nothing. - Really?

331
00:15:34,323 --> 00:15:36,010
Then I'll go wash my face.

332
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:46,926
This is driving me crazy!

333
00:15:48,802 --> 00:15:50,894
Hey, what's wrong? Did something happen?

334
00:15:52,672 --> 00:15:55,298
Ki Bong, the thing is...

335
00:15:55,942 --> 00:15:58,311
What? Jung Eun got fired?

336
00:15:58,312 --> 00:15:59,423
Yes.

337
00:15:59,483 --> 00:16:03,119
But I can't tell her because she'll be so disappointed.

338
00:16:03,282 --> 00:16:04,899
- Then don't tell her. - What?

339
00:16:05,182 --> 00:16:08,452
What about the shoot tomorrow, then? She'll find out anyway.

340
00:16:08,453 --> 00:16:11,222
- Then you should tell her. - She's getting back into acting.

341
00:16:11,223 --> 00:16:12,839
What if she gives up?

342
00:16:12,993 --> 00:16:14,478
- Then don't tell her. - What?

343
00:16:15,562 --> 00:16:17,047
You idiot.

344
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:19,684
I'm a lunatic for expecting advice from an idiot like you.

345
00:16:20,363 --> 00:16:23,832
Die! Die, you lunatic. Die!

346
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:28,115
Like the letters written in the sand

347
00:16:28,272 --> 00:16:32,322
Where the waves once were

348
00:16:32,412 --> 00:16:34,911
I'm afraid

349
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:38,457
- You may disappear - Enough. Stop, please.

350
00:16:38,552 --> 00:16:40,270
Why? Did something sound weird?

351
00:16:40,623 --> 00:16:41,992
No, it's not that.

352
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:44,547
I just don't think that this song is right for you.

353
00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:46,492
It really is a difficult song to sing.

354
00:16:46,493 --> 00:16:50,169
Would there be anything else that's just a tiny bit easier?

355
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,527
Something else? Well...

356
00:16:54,432 --> 00:16:55,771
how about IU's "Good Day"?

357
00:16:55,772 --> 00:16:58,641
What? "Good Day"? The song with the 3-level high notes?

358
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,744
Yes! More than anything, I'm pretty confident about my high notes.

359
00:17:01,843 --> 00:17:02,853
Do you want to hear?

360
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:08,223
One, two

361
00:17:08,283 --> 00:17:16,332
I'm in my dream

362
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:20,149
Such a good day

363
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:22,062
How was it?

364
00:17:22,063 --> 00:17:23,203
Oh, well...

365
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,501
It was good. It was, but...

366
00:17:26,502 --> 00:17:30,072
I'm just slightly wondering whether your vocal range...

367
00:17:30,073 --> 00:17:33,940
may be a bit limited for the 3-level high notes,

368
00:17:34,373 --> 00:17:36,292
just a tiny little bit.

369
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:40,813
Then I'll try to stretch my vocal range as much as I can this time.

370
00:17:41,343 --> 00:17:42,382
- Oh my - Oh my.

371
00:17:42,383 --> 00:17:43,411
One, two

372
00:17:43,412 --> 00:17:51,432
I'm in my dream

373
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:57,113
Stop, stop! Han Soo Yeon!

374
00:17:57,732 --> 00:17:58,731
You call that the "3-level high notes"?

375
00:17:58,732 --> 00:18:01,302
The tone is the same and only your hand's raised.

376
00:18:01,303 --> 00:18:04,101
If that's how you see it, I could do 30 levels! Should I show you?

377
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:10,830
I'm in my dream

378
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,012
See? Is that what you'd call the "30-level high notes"?

379
00:18:15,013 --> 00:18:16,629
Is it?

380
00:18:17,452 --> 00:18:18,796
Do you have a hearing problem?

381
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:21,647
I said, "Do you?"

382
00:18:22,023 --> 00:18:24,749
Woo Shik! I asked you how it was.

383
00:18:25,293 --> 00:18:28,596
Oh. It's much better.

384
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:31,390
I was so surprised.

385
00:18:31,462 --> 00:18:33,887
Right? I told you! I'll sing it from the start, then.

386
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:42,435
I like you

387
00:18:44,712 --> 00:18:45,711
Oh my

388
00:18:45,712 --> 00:18:46,782
One, two

389
00:18:46,783 --> 00:18:52,276
I'm in my dream

390
00:18:55,922 --> 00:18:59,832
Your cheeks have sunken in, in just a week.

391
00:19:00,323 --> 00:19:02,685
Yu Ri, it's too much for me.

392
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:06,460
I've lost my appetite and I have nightmares every night.

393
00:19:07,662 --> 00:19:09,931
My heart starts to pound...

394
00:19:09,932 --> 00:19:11,941
just by seeing IU on television.

395
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,241
How bad must her singing be...

396
00:19:14,242 --> 00:19:16,161
for you to have gotten to this state?

397
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:18,733
IU? IU!

398
00:19:18,942 --> 00:19:19,992
It's okay.

399
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:24,003
Jun Ki, didn't you say you have a shoot today?

400
00:19:24,452 --> 00:19:25,462
Yes.

401
00:19:26,353 --> 00:19:27,721
Did you tell Jung Eun?

402
00:19:27,722 --> 00:19:29,339
- No - You haven't?

403
00:19:29,922 --> 00:19:31,164
What are you going to do?

404
00:19:31,523 --> 00:19:33,583
Jun Ki! Did you sleep well?

405
00:19:33,662 --> 00:19:35,955
What day is it today? It's filming day!

406
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:38,486
Hold on a minute. I'll be right back with my stuff.

407
00:19:41,773 --> 00:19:44,864
Look at her, just look! She's so happy!

408
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:48,679
How can I tell her when she's so happy about it?

409
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,631
This is driving me crazy!

410
00:19:52,113 --> 00:19:54,980
Ki Bong, do you have any ideas?

411
00:19:55,982 --> 00:19:57,481
Just tell her that the movie has been cancelled, then.

412
00:19:57,482 --> 00:19:58,564
What?

413
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:02,733
Then what about me? I'll still have to go.

414
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:04,983
You can just tell her that you're going for a walk.

415
00:20:05,763 --> 00:20:07,844
What? A walk?

416
00:20:10,863 --> 00:20:14,033
You're a genius! I thought you were stupid, but I guess not.

417
00:20:14,202 --> 00:20:15,284
Genius!

418
00:20:18,773 --> 00:20:20,042
- Jung Eun. - What is it?

419
00:20:20,043 --> 00:20:21,542
I was just about to come out.

420
00:20:21,543 --> 00:20:22,754
The thing is...

421
00:20:23,412 --> 00:20:24,554
How should I say this...

422
00:20:24,843 --> 00:20:26,833
I just got a call from the producer.

423
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,512
The movie has been cancelled.

424
00:20:28,513 --> 00:20:31,139
What? What do you mean?

425
00:20:31,182 --> 00:20:33,582
The investors pulled their funds,

426
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,269
so they have to hold the shoot.

427
00:20:35,523 --> 00:20:37,068
- Really? - Yes.

428
00:20:38,422 --> 00:20:41,250
I never thought this was coming.

429
00:20:42,732 --> 00:20:44,349
Don't get too upset.

430
00:20:44,593 --> 00:20:46,450
I'm sure another opportunity will come up.

431
00:20:46,563 --> 00:20:47,573
For both of us.

432
00:20:49,303 --> 00:20:50,443
Get some rest, then.

433
00:21:00,242 --> 00:21:01,627
Did you tell her? What did she say?

434
00:21:02,383 --> 00:21:04,373
She got so disappointed, of course.

435
00:21:04,912 --> 00:21:06,842
I don't feel too good about it.

436
00:21:07,053 --> 00:21:09,921
Well, it's much better off to tell her that the movie was cancelled...

437
00:21:09,922 --> 00:21:12,862
than tell her that she got fired for her bad acting. It will hurt less.

438
00:21:12,863 --> 00:21:14,508
That's true,

439
00:21:14,763 --> 00:21:16,379
but I feel bad about it.

440
00:21:21,232 --> 00:21:22,314
Jung Eun!

441
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:25,572
Why are you out? Are you going somewhere?

442
00:21:26,402 --> 00:21:27,802
I'm just going out for a walk.

443
00:21:27,803 --> 00:21:28,853
A walk?

444
00:21:29,273 --> 00:21:30,441
To where?

445
00:21:30,442 --> 00:21:32,681
I thought I'd visit the movie set.

446
00:21:32,682 --> 00:21:34,934
What? The set?

447
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,951
Why would you go there?

448
00:21:36,952 --> 00:21:39,751
I practiced all night for days.

449
00:21:39,752 --> 00:21:42,479
It's too disappointing to think that it's over.

450
00:21:42,523 --> 00:21:45,961
What do you mean, disappointing? Why bother going there?

451
00:21:45,962 --> 00:21:47,377
It will only break your heart.

452
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,431
There won't be anyone there, anyway.

453
00:21:49,432 --> 00:21:53,645
I know. But I don't think I'll be able to give it up...

454
00:21:53,932 --> 00:21:55,487
unless I see the movie set for myself.

455
00:21:55,972 --> 00:21:57,347
See you later then.

456
00:21:57,603 --> 00:22:01,613
What? Jung Eun. Jung Eun!

457
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,662
Ki Bong, what do I do now?

458
00:22:05,982 --> 00:22:07,559
Maybe you shouldn't have told her that.

459
00:22:07,712 --> 00:22:10,884
What? Why, you bird-brain, you knucklehead!

460
00:22:11,053 --> 00:22:13,073
I'm the fool for listening to an idiot like you!

461
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,292
Jung Eun, Jung Eun!

462
00:22:20,293 --> 00:22:21,374
Wait a minute.

463
00:22:21,863 --> 00:22:25,297
Why would you want to go all the way there?

464
00:22:25,462 --> 00:22:29,102
It'll only break your heart. What's the use?

465
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,386
I know.

466
00:22:30,603 --> 00:22:32,896
But I'm too disappointed.

467
00:22:33,573 --> 00:22:35,491
It's so upsetting!

468
00:22:36,073 --> 00:22:39,141
I understand. Of course I get that you're upset.

469
00:22:39,142 --> 00:22:41,365
Why wouldn't I? I totally understand!

470
00:22:41,742 --> 00:22:44,813
But still, let's not go to the set.

471
00:22:45,013 --> 00:22:46,599
- Jun Ki. - Yes?

472
00:22:46,623 --> 00:22:48,052
Should we go get a drink?

473
00:22:48,053 --> 00:22:51,751
How can we drink broad daylight?

474
00:22:51,752 --> 00:22:54,491
Besides, you always fall asleep and get carried home when you drink.

475
00:22:54,492 --> 00:22:55,877
Then maybe...

476
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:59,129
I should just go visit the set.

477
00:22:59,432 --> 00:23:00,513
The set?

478
00:23:00,763 --> 00:23:04,813
Jung Eun, wait a minute. Jung Eun, please!

479
00:23:05,702 --> 00:23:07,995
Think, Jun Ki. Think, Jun Ki.

480
00:23:10,313 --> 00:23:11,858
Jung Eun, wait a minute.

481
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:14,911
Let's go. Let's go for a drink.

482
00:23:14,912 --> 00:23:17,951
You said that you didn't want to because I always fall asleep.

483
00:23:17,952 --> 00:23:19,751
That's why we should go and drink!

484
00:23:19,752 --> 00:23:22,622
Sometimes, it's best to tank up and take a nap.

485
00:23:22,623 --> 00:23:25,521
Let's go! Let's go get drunk!

486
00:23:26,692 --> 00:23:28,612
Why are you here, Yu Ri?

487
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:32,832
I just wanted to come and watch.

488
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,448
Oh, I see.

489
00:23:35,063 --> 00:23:37,356
Woo Shik, what's wrong? Are you feeling sick?

490
00:23:37,432 --> 00:23:39,089
What? No...

491
00:23:39,603 --> 00:23:40,613
I'm fine.

492
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,153
That's a relief.

493
00:23:42,313 --> 00:23:43,572
Shall we begin?

494
00:23:43,573 --> 00:23:44,653
Yes, sure.

495
00:23:44,742 --> 00:23:46,741
Should we do a warm-up?

496
00:23:46,742 --> 00:23:49,211
What do you mean, a warm-up? I'm not even a beginner.

497
00:23:49,212 --> 00:23:53,061
How about we get straight to business, since we have a guest?

498
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:55,172
"Straight to business"?

499
00:23:58,252 --> 00:23:59,461
What are you doing?

500
00:23:59,462 --> 00:24:02,160
I wanted to try dancing, too, as if it were the real thing.

501
00:24:02,293 --> 00:24:03,562
- Dancing? - Yes.

502
00:24:03,563 --> 00:24:05,623
Since the singing's all good, I should work on the choreography.

503
00:24:05,803 --> 00:24:06,874
Here I go!

504
00:24:19,813 --> 00:24:23,246
Your cold eyes, they kill me

505
00:24:24,813 --> 00:24:28,256
The fire in your heart, there only ashes remaining

506
00:24:30,252 --> 00:24:33,899
Maybe time is medicine, but I'm getting weaker

507
00:24:35,023 --> 00:24:38,739
The sad pain is getting numb too

508
00:24:40,263 --> 00:24:43,072
My eyes

509
00:24:43,073 --> 00:24:46,872
My spilling touch

510
00:24:46,873 --> 00:24:50,750
My one and only lover

511
00:24:50,873 --> 00:24:55,327
From my head, bboom bboom, to my toes, bboom bboom bboom

512
00:24:56,383 --> 00:24:59,421
Cheer up baby, cheer up baby

513
00:24:59,422 --> 00:25:01,645
Cheer up a little more

514
00:25:01,883 --> 00:25:04,651
A girl can’t give her heart too easily

515
00:25:04,652 --> 00:25:06,322
That’s how you’ll get to

516
00:25:06,323 --> 00:25:08,818
Stop, stop! Hey, Han Soo Yeon!

517
00:25:09,192 --> 00:25:11,491
Are you out of your mind? You can't even sing while standing straight.

518
00:25:11,492 --> 00:25:13,887
Don't even think about the choreography!

519
00:25:14,202 --> 00:25:17,132
Why don't you try singing properly, first?

520
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:20,042
That's right, you brat! "Cheer up", my foot!

521
00:25:20,043 --> 00:25:21,901
You're wearing me out, you brat!

522
00:25:21,902 --> 00:25:23,241
Who do you think you are?

523
00:25:23,242 --> 00:25:24,959
Exactly!

524
00:25:25,613 --> 00:25:27,662
Woo Shik! Yu Ri!

525
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,662
What?

526
00:25:29,712 --> 00:25:32,421
What's wrong? I'm done. Why aren't you saying anything?

527
00:25:32,422 --> 00:25:33,852
Is it over already?

528
00:25:33,853 --> 00:25:37,092
I was so into it that I didn't even notice.

529
00:25:37,093 --> 00:25:38,163
Exactly!

530
00:25:38,992 --> 00:25:41,749
You were so shockingly...

531
00:25:42,162 --> 00:25:43,172
good.

532
00:25:43,863 --> 00:25:46,661
I fell so deeply into it.

533
00:25:46,662 --> 00:25:50,072
Is that so? Do you anything else to add on, Woo Shik?

534
00:25:50,073 --> 00:25:52,366
What? No. No, I don't.

535
00:25:52,972 --> 00:25:54,084
Really?

536
00:25:54,472 --> 00:25:55,857
I'll go to the shift now.

537
00:25:57,942 --> 00:25:59,024
See?

538
00:26:00,113 --> 00:26:01,123
Sure.

539
00:26:03,212 --> 00:26:06,819
Brother! How have you endured this all this time?

540
00:26:06,883 --> 00:26:09,075
I don't really know.

541
00:26:09,553 --> 00:26:12,218
Sometimes, when I just imagine her singing,

542
00:26:13,192 --> 00:26:14,707
my chest feels stuffy...

543
00:26:15,692 --> 00:26:16,844
and it's hard for me to breath...

544
00:26:20,803 --> 00:26:21,813
Brother!

545
00:26:25,303 --> 00:26:29,080
Doctor, what's wrong with him?

546
00:26:30,212 --> 00:26:32,304
It's due to anger.

547
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:34,612
It's something that middle-aged women suffer from...

548
00:26:34,613 --> 00:26:37,542
after being agonized for years by their drunkard husbands.

549
00:26:37,682 --> 00:26:39,672
How did such a young lad turn out like this?

550
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:42,838
This won't do.

551
00:26:42,922 --> 00:26:44,792
You should stop teaching her how to sing.

552
00:26:44,793 --> 00:26:46,813
No, I still have to do it.

553
00:26:48,162 --> 00:26:50,890
It's a chance for me to get closer to Soo Yeon.

554
00:26:51,363 --> 00:26:53,927
Sir, can you just prescribe...

555
00:26:54,033 --> 00:26:56,093
the strongest medicine you have?

556
00:26:58,232 --> 00:26:59,819
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

557
00:27:02,642 --> 00:27:05,268
All right. She falls asleep whenever she's drunk.

558
00:27:05,482 --> 00:27:07,042
I'll keep making her drink and make her fall asleep.

559
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:08,901
Then I'll go to the set.

560
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:13,340
Jung Eun, have a drink.

561
00:27:13,652 --> 00:27:14,865
Here.

562
00:27:17,252 --> 00:27:18,391
There you go.

563
00:27:18,392 --> 00:27:20,421
All right. Drink up...

564
00:27:20,422 --> 00:27:23,491
and take a nap and forget about everything. Okay?

565
00:27:23,492 --> 00:27:24,604
Okay.

566
00:27:27,662 --> 00:27:29,753
- Why aren't you drinking? - Well.

567
00:27:30,873 --> 00:27:33,528
I have an upset stomach. I'm fine, so go on.

568
00:27:34,442 --> 00:27:37,270
Forget it. I don't want to drink alone like this.

569
00:27:37,472 --> 00:27:40,341
I'll just go back to the set.

570
00:27:40,482 --> 00:27:41,654
The set?

571
00:27:42,013 --> 00:27:43,466
No, no.

572
00:27:43,613 --> 00:27:45,370
Let's drink. I'll drink with you.

573
00:27:45,553 --> 00:27:46,996
Sit down.

574
00:27:47,422 --> 00:27:48,867
Why are you in such a hurry?

575
00:27:53,222 --> 00:27:55,081
Let's say cheers. Cheers.

576
00:28:00,932 --> 00:28:04,337
Here. Have another glass. There you go.

577
00:28:04,603 --> 00:28:06,901
Again? Why are you in such a hurry?

578
00:28:06,902 --> 00:28:09,095
Soju tastes the best when you drink in a hurry.

579
00:28:09,742 --> 00:28:12,711
All right then. Let's say cheers. Cheers.

580
00:28:19,752 --> 00:28:21,541
- Slowly. - What kind of medicine is that?

581
00:28:21,982 --> 00:28:23,872
- Are you sick? - It's none of your business.

582
00:28:26,722 --> 00:28:27,862
I'm home.

583
00:28:27,863 --> 00:28:28,973
Hey, you're back.

584
00:28:29,363 --> 00:28:30,705
It's all right.

585
00:28:31,662 --> 00:28:33,682
Why does your voice sound so down?

586
00:28:33,763 --> 00:28:36,662
I was told off that I stink at singing at work today.

587
00:28:39,273 --> 00:28:42,101
My boss told me never to hold the microphone from now on.

588
00:28:45,113 --> 00:28:48,441
Woo Shik, I want to stop learning how to sing.

589
00:28:48,442 --> 00:28:50,937
What? But why?

590
00:28:51,383 --> 00:28:53,575
I'm thinking about enrolling in a real vocal academy.

591
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:56,315
- What? A vocal academy? - Yes.

592
00:28:56,952 --> 00:29:00,699
I think learning from a more talented teacher might be better.

593
00:29:00,763 --> 00:29:01,874
What?

594
00:29:02,392 --> 00:29:03,961
Are you saying I didn't...

595
00:29:03,962 --> 00:29:06,387
teach you properly because I lack talent?

596
00:29:07,563 --> 00:29:08,915
It's not that, but...

597
00:29:09,402 --> 00:29:12,432
I can't say you're not partially responsible.

598
00:29:13,242 --> 00:29:14,272
What did you say?

599
00:29:14,273 --> 00:29:16,030
With that being said,

600
00:29:16,313 --> 00:29:18,463
I actually didn't like the way you taught me.

601
00:29:18,912 --> 00:29:20,312
You don't have enough equipment,

602
00:29:20,313 --> 00:29:22,282
you're inconsistent, and you keep teaching me the same thing.

603
00:29:22,283 --> 00:29:24,612
And if there's a problem, you have to scold me from time to time,

604
00:29:24,613 --> 00:29:26,906
but all you do is compliment me, and that's why I'm not improving.

605
00:29:27,482 --> 00:29:30,451
You're too nice, and you don't have a bit of charisma at all.

606
00:29:30,922 --> 00:29:34,327
Stop it! Hey, Han Soo Yeon!

607
00:29:34,462 --> 00:29:35,991
What did you say? I'm the problem?

608
00:29:35,992 --> 00:29:37,991
I didn't teach you properly so you didn't improve?

609
00:29:37,992 --> 00:29:40,602
Hey. Even if Freddie Mercury comes back alive this instant,

610
00:29:40,603 --> 00:29:43,026
he won't be able to fix your singing. You're the worst ever!

611
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:44,501
I came down with...

612
00:29:44,502 --> 00:29:46,219
stress from anger while trying to teach you.

613
00:29:46,543 --> 00:29:49,703
I made herbal medicine at an oriental clinic because of you.

614
00:29:49,972 --> 00:29:51,241
But what did you say?

615
00:29:51,242 --> 00:29:53,303
How could you blabber such nonsense?

616
00:29:53,482 --> 00:29:55,882
This. Your mouth is the problem.

617
00:29:55,883 --> 00:29:59,054
I just want to rip this off. Goodness!

618
00:29:59,152 --> 00:30:01,677
Woo Shik, what do you think you're doing?

619
00:30:01,752 --> 00:30:02,903
What? Why?

620
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:04,538
Woo Shik, are you mad?

621
00:30:04,623 --> 00:30:06,077
- What are you doing? - Why?

622
00:30:06,363 --> 00:30:08,917
- Isn't this my imagination? - What imagination?

623
00:30:09,133 --> 00:30:10,931
You lunatic!

624
00:30:10,932 --> 00:30:13,155
No way. This can't be. This is my imagination.

625
00:30:14,533 --> 00:30:15,683
Don't tell me...

626
00:30:18,432 --> 00:30:19,513
Oh, gosh!

627
00:30:19,942 --> 00:30:21,720
Soo... Soo Yeon.

628
00:30:22,343 --> 00:30:25,473
Okay. I'm sorry for being so terrible at singing.

629
00:30:25,613 --> 00:30:27,935
- I'm sorry. - But...

630
00:30:28,482 --> 00:30:30,981
I really thought it was my imagination.

631
00:30:30,982 --> 00:30:32,451
Up until now, it was always my imagination.

632
00:30:32,452 --> 00:30:33,897
So I thought I was imagining again.

633
00:30:35,283 --> 00:30:37,792
That means you've been badmouthing me inside all along.

634
00:30:37,793 --> 00:30:40,792
What? No, it's not that. It's...

635
00:30:40,793 --> 00:30:41,874
Forget it!

636
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:45,588
Don't talk to me ever again, you jerk!

637
00:30:46,462 --> 00:30:47,977
Soo Yeon, I'm sorry.

638
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:51,231
Soo Yeon, I really thought I was imagining it.

639
00:30:56,843 --> 00:31:00,478
Why is it so hard to make her fall asleep today?

640
00:31:01,142 --> 00:31:04,182
It's almost time for my shoot. This is driving me nuts.

641
00:31:05,252 --> 00:31:06,494
I have no choice.

642
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:09,078
It's time for the last resort.

644
00:31:28,202 --> 00:31:30,637
Hey, Jung Eun. Lift your glass.

645
00:31:32,043 --> 00:31:34,612
Hey. Isn't this a bit too much?

646
00:31:34,613 --> 00:31:36,975
We have to drink on a day like this.

647
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:38,394
Let's go!

648
00:31:38,553 --> 00:31:40,543
Let's drink until the end!

649
00:31:41,952 --> 00:31:44,174
Okay, let's go!

650
00:31:56,073 --> 00:31:59,173
Yes, I did it. She fell asleep.

651
00:32:00,073 --> 00:32:02,496
Hold on, I have to make a call.

652
00:32:06,682 --> 00:32:08,429
Hey, Ki Bong?

653
00:32:09,152 --> 00:32:12,415
I'm at the Twin's Bar.

654
00:32:13,152 --> 00:32:15,819
Jung Eun is drunk and she fell asleep.

655
00:32:16,053 --> 00:32:17,436
I have to go to a shoot.

656
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,388
You should come and take her home.

657
00:32:21,093 --> 00:32:23,820
Okay. Okay, thanks.

658
00:32:31,373 --> 00:32:34,230
Jun Ki, where are you going?

659
00:32:34,343 --> 00:32:35,413
I'm not going.

660
00:32:36,142 --> 00:32:38,738
Where would I go?

661
00:32:38,813 --> 00:32:41,368
Get back over here. We should have another drink.

662
00:32:44,182 --> 00:32:45,324
Let's go!

663
00:32:46,283 --> 00:32:48,646
Let's go one more time!

664
00:32:55,222 --> 00:32:56,374
Okay.

665
00:32:56,593 --> 00:32:58,148
She's really asleep. I have to go.

666
00:33:02,573 --> 00:33:05,603
- Are you okay? - Ma'am, please be quiet.

667
00:33:07,573 --> 00:33:11,411
My friend will come pick her up.

668
00:33:12,373 --> 00:33:14,735
You must not wake her up.

669
00:33:15,613 --> 00:33:16,795
I have to go.

670
00:33:16,883 --> 00:33:19,205
I have to go for a shoot.

671
00:33:21,652 --> 00:33:23,643
All right. Is everyone ready?

672
00:33:23,992 --> 00:33:25,134
- Hello, sir. - Hello.

673
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:30,860
Jun Ki, I like those eyes today.

674
00:33:32,162 --> 00:33:34,284
- You do? - Wow, even your voice.

675
00:33:34,363 --> 00:33:35,817
You really sound possessed.

676
00:33:36,273 --> 00:33:38,671
Okay, then. Let's begin shooting.

677
00:33:38,672 --> 00:33:40,187
- Okay. - Okay.

678
00:33:42,543 --> 00:33:45,068
Ready, action!

679
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,997
What is your name?

680
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:55,510
Park Yi Do...

681
00:33:57,192 --> 00:33:58,263
Park Yi Do.

682
00:33:58,692 --> 00:33:59,904
I knew it was you.

683
00:34:00,523 --> 00:34:02,007
In the name of the Lord,

684
00:34:02,892 --> 00:34:05,457
I order you to leave this man's body at once!

685
00:34:23,783 --> 00:34:24,894
Hyung Chul!

686
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:27,481
Are you all right? You must've been terrified.

687
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,664
This isn't enough.

688
00:34:28,922 --> 00:34:31,478
- Maria, give me the holy water. - Yes, Father.

689
00:34:34,192 --> 00:34:37,930
In the name of the Father, the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,

690
00:34:38,192 --> 00:34:39,919
You demon, go away!

691
00:34:52,413 --> 00:34:53,553
Cut!

692
00:34:54,812 --> 00:34:55,924
Give him a big hand.

693
00:34:56,913 --> 00:34:58,831
That was some killer acting.

694
00:34:59,982 --> 00:35:01,569
That was incredible.

695
00:35:02,223 --> 00:35:05,758
In my 30 years as a director, I've never seen such passionate acting.

696
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,203
Really?

697
00:35:07,622 --> 00:35:10,794
Jun Ki, you'll be the male lead of my next movie.

698
00:35:11,993 --> 00:35:13,244
Me?

699
00:35:13,703 --> 00:35:15,279
Thank you!

700
00:35:15,602 --> 00:35:19,036
Can you show me the act you just did one more time?

701
00:35:19,102 --> 00:35:20,183
Again?

702
00:35:20,343 --> 00:35:23,272
Of course. I'll show you.

703
00:35:25,883 --> 00:35:26,993
The male lead.

704
00:35:38,593 --> 00:35:39,632
Ki Bong.

705
00:35:40,792 --> 00:35:41,904
Ma'am?

706
00:35:42,323 --> 00:35:45,191
- Why are you here? - You asked me to come.

707
00:35:45,292 --> 00:35:47,283
Really? No, I didn't.

708
00:35:47,633 --> 00:35:49,825
I never said that.

709
00:35:50,033 --> 00:35:52,355
Wait, I'll go home later.

710
00:35:52,502 --> 00:35:55,532
I have to go and show the director my acting again.

711
00:36:07,122 --> 00:36:09,081
Ma'am, how long has he been doing this?

712
00:36:09,082 --> 00:36:11,578
He's been like this ever since he fainted on his way out.

713
00:36:12,053 --> 00:36:15,901
Park Yi Do!

714
00:36:20,633 --> 00:36:21,743
That scared me.

715
00:36:22,002 --> 00:36:23,891
What on earth is he doing?

716
00:36:24,172 --> 00:36:26,020
Are you all right? You must've been terrified.

717
00:36:26,203 --> 00:36:28,223
Are you all right? You must've been terrified.

718
00:36:29,613 --> 00:36:30,855
What's her issue?

719
00:36:32,212 --> 00:36:34,364
Seriously, these guys are a total disgrace.

720
00:36:37,613 --> 00:36:39,401
Are you all right? You must've been terrified.

721
00:36:43,192 --> 00:36:45,617
Are you all right? You must've been terrified.

722
00:36:48,893 --> 00:36:50,831
Darn it.

723
00:36:50,832 --> 00:36:53,328
Hey, until when are you going to be like this?

724
00:36:53,562 --> 00:36:55,162
We never told you to drink that much.

725
00:36:55,163 --> 00:36:58,535
Jung Eun kept saying she'd go to the set, so I had no choice.

726
00:36:58,973 --> 00:37:02,972
Well, her feelings aren't hurt. That's all that matters.

727
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:05,568
You care so much about Jung Eun.

728
00:37:05,613 --> 00:37:08,339
By the way, have you apologized to Soo Yeon?

729
00:37:08,613 --> 00:37:09,966
No, not yet.

730
00:37:09,982 --> 00:37:11,811
She wouldn't even talk to me. What can I do?

731
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:15,620
Hey, being a bad singer isn't a sin. Why humiliate her like that?

732
00:37:15,922 --> 00:37:17,770
Do you dislike Soo Yeon that much?

733
00:37:18,093 --> 00:37:19,691
Why do you always pick on her?

734
00:37:19,692 --> 00:37:23,066
- When did I pick on her? - Come on. You do it every day.

735
00:37:23,232 --> 00:37:26,192
This jerk hated the idea of her living with us to begin with.

736
00:37:26,303 --> 00:37:27,432
Yes, exactly.

737
00:37:27,433 --> 00:37:29,262
She's going through a rough patch because of her dad's bankruptcy.

738
00:37:29,263 --> 00:37:30,918
Don't be mean to her.

739
00:37:31,002 --> 00:37:32,401
What did I do?

740
00:37:32,402 --> 00:37:33,412
I'm back.

741
00:37:34,343 --> 00:37:35,585
Hey, Soo Yeon.

742
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:44,942
Soo Yeon, I'm sorry about yesterday.

743
00:37:45,683 --> 00:37:47,151
Forgive me, please?

744
00:37:47,152 --> 00:37:50,051
Forget it. I'm tired. I'm going to my room.

745
00:37:50,522 --> 00:37:52,822
Hey, I said I'm sorry.

746
00:37:52,823 --> 00:37:54,237
Forgive me already.

747
00:37:54,723 --> 00:37:56,492
I'm not upset because of you.

748
00:37:56,493 --> 00:37:58,662
Then what is it? What's the problem?

749
00:37:58,663 --> 00:38:00,653
Tell me. Tell me what the problem is.

750
00:38:01,433 --> 00:38:03,322
I got fired.

751
00:38:04,303 --> 00:38:07,606
I'm so upset right now. Must you yell at me like this? You jerk!

752
00:38:08,303 --> 00:38:09,858
Darn it.

753
00:38:11,013 --> 00:38:13,871
Hey, I was just trying to... I was...

754
00:38:15,442 --> 00:38:16,997
Gosh, that punk.

755
00:38:17,312 --> 00:38:21,322
You jerk, are you human or demon?

756
00:38:21,323 --> 00:38:23,675
How could you be this mean to your friend? You're such a jerk!

757
00:38:23,893 --> 00:38:25,592
You're a jerk!

758
00:38:25,593 --> 00:38:27,392
Guys, that was... I was just...

759
00:38:27,393 --> 00:38:29,632
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

760
00:38:29,633 --> 00:38:32,522
(Guy Friend)

761
00:38:33,763 --> 00:38:35,823
- Good job, Ki Bong. - Good work.

762
00:38:38,372 --> 00:38:39,412
Hey, Ki Bong.

763
00:38:40,703 --> 00:38:43,602
Not passing the major league test must've been very disappointing.

764
00:38:44,743 --> 00:38:46,459
- No, sir. - Come on. Don't act all tough.

765
00:38:46,613 --> 00:38:48,912
To tell you the truth, the coach from the major league...

766
00:38:48,913 --> 00:38:51,307
was very torn until the end because of you.

767
00:38:51,383 --> 00:38:55,651
He said your ball power is good, but your pitches are too simple.

768
00:38:55,652 --> 00:38:59,191
It'd be great if you could throw the forkball.

769
00:38:59,192 --> 00:39:00,334
The forkball?

770
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,961
Oh, boy. What shall we have for lunch?

771
00:39:03,962 --> 00:39:05,061
What? Lunch?

772
00:39:05,062 --> 00:39:06,112
Hey.

773
00:39:06,363 --> 00:39:09,504
How could you talk about lunch after making Soo Yeon cry like that?

774
00:39:09,573 --> 00:39:13,381
Anyhow, you'd better apologize to her again today.

775
00:39:13,542 --> 00:39:16,098
- Okay, you demon? - Yes, I heard you.

776
00:39:16,473 --> 00:39:18,171
- I'm heading out. - Where are you going?

777
00:39:18,172 --> 00:39:19,283
It's none of your business.

778
00:39:22,042 --> 00:39:23,163
Yu Ri, what are you up to?

779
00:39:25,513 --> 00:39:27,581
I've had enough fun,

780
00:39:27,582 --> 00:39:29,691
so I should start working again.

781
00:39:29,692 --> 00:39:32,481
You want to work? Then will you work in the hotel kitchen again?

782
00:39:32,922 --> 00:39:35,144
Do you think I'm crazy? I'd never work there again.

783
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:37,032
No matter how hard I work,

784
00:39:37,033 --> 00:39:39,831
they'll belittle and disrespect me because I never studied abroad.

785
00:39:39,863 --> 00:39:42,032
I'm going to open a restaurant.

786
00:39:42,033 --> 00:39:43,416
I already have a name for it.

787
00:39:43,803 --> 00:39:45,532
Yu Ri's Kitchen. Isn't it awesome?

788
00:39:45,533 --> 00:39:46,816
Do you have money to do that?

789
00:39:47,473 --> 00:39:49,795
No, I'll start saving now.

790
00:39:50,172 --> 00:39:54,081
For the rent deposit and so on, I'll need about 50,000 dollars.

791
00:39:54,082 --> 00:39:56,452
50,000 dollars? How much do you have saved up?

792
00:39:56,453 --> 00:39:57,581
3.80 dollars.

793
00:39:57,582 --> 00:40:00,782
So I just have to save 49,996.20 dollars.

794
00:40:00,783 --> 00:40:02,237
Gosh, I knew it.

795
00:40:04,692 --> 00:40:06,461
Brother, with that being said,

796
00:40:06,462 --> 00:40:09,061
you should invest in my restaurant if you have some cash surplus.

797
00:40:09,062 --> 00:40:10,749
Cash surplus, my foot.

798
00:40:10,962 --> 00:40:12,377
I can't spare even a penny for you.

799
00:40:12,692 --> 00:40:13,713
Is that so?

800
00:40:15,203 --> 00:40:17,697
Gosh, where am I going to get all that money?

801
00:40:17,933 --> 00:40:22,619
I wonder if I can find a dumb, rich guy somewhere.

802
00:40:23,843 --> 00:40:25,085
Who's phone is that?

803
00:40:26,743 --> 00:40:27,954
I think this is Ki Bong's phone.

804
00:40:30,212 --> 00:40:31,262
Really?

805
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,573
Then I shall drop this off for him.

806
00:40:36,223 --> 00:40:37,492
- Please. - Gosh.

807
00:40:37,493 --> 00:40:39,191
You want to learn how to throw the forkball?

808
00:40:39,192 --> 00:40:42,526
Yes, no one else in Korea can throw the forkball like you do.

809
00:40:42,663 --> 00:40:45,016
Well, that is true.

810
00:40:45,663 --> 00:40:48,693
Hey, not everyone can do it.

811
00:40:49,772 --> 00:40:52,001
Gosh, don't laugh at me.

812
00:40:52,002 --> 00:40:54,971
I'm not laughing at you. I'm just baffled.

813
00:40:56,272 --> 00:40:57,572
Goodness, you're doing it again!

814
00:40:57,573 --> 00:40:58,912
Stop laughing at me already.

815
00:40:58,913 --> 00:41:01,112
Teach me how to throw the forkball. Please?

816
00:41:01,113 --> 00:41:03,081
- No. Not a chance. - Gosh, please.

817
00:41:03,082 --> 00:41:04,194
Ki Bong!

818
00:41:05,553 --> 00:41:06,694
Hey, Yu Ri.

819
00:41:12,252 --> 00:41:13,262
What brings you here?

820
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:16,291
You left your phone, so I thought I should drop it off for you.

821
00:41:16,292 --> 00:41:18,050
- Here. - Oh, I see.

822
00:41:18,263 --> 00:41:20,080
- Thanks. - No problem.

823
00:41:21,402 --> 00:41:23,401
You owe me 22 dollars for this, including the surtax.

824
00:41:23,402 --> 00:41:25,796
I owe you? Surtax?

825
00:41:25,803 --> 00:41:29,539
Hey, you have to pay the surtax even on candy.

826
00:41:29,743 --> 00:41:31,472
- Pay me already. - This is ridiculous.

827
00:41:31,473 --> 00:41:32,642
Take it back, then.

828
00:41:32,643 --> 00:41:35,410
Look at you. Is this how you'll play it?

829
00:41:35,783 --> 00:41:38,105
- You'll regret this. - Whatever.

830
00:41:38,183 --> 00:41:39,382
What are you going to do?

831
00:41:39,383 --> 00:41:42,322
The guys at the guesthouse don't seem to know...

832
00:41:42,323 --> 00:41:45,150
that our kiss was your first kiss. Shall I go ahead and tell everyone?

833
00:41:45,393 --> 00:41:47,918
If you'd like, I can also post about it on your team's website.

834
00:41:48,022 --> 00:41:51,164
Wait, Yu Ri. I'll pay you. I'll give you the money.

835
00:41:51,792 --> 00:41:55,166
You absolutely can't tell anyone about it, okay?

836
00:41:55,232 --> 00:41:56,888
You should've listened to me from the get-go.

837
00:41:57,073 --> 00:42:00,941
Okay! Now, I just need to save 49,974.20 dollars.

838
00:42:00,942 --> 00:42:01,952
Thank you.

839
00:42:04,243 --> 00:42:06,191
Gosh, that psycho...

840
00:42:07,643 --> 00:42:08,895
- Who is she? - What?

841
00:42:10,252 --> 00:42:11,727
She's my buddy's sister.

842
00:42:12,013 --> 00:42:13,195
I see.

843
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:15,993
Is that right?

844
00:42:18,093 --> 00:42:19,406
What? A blind date?

845
00:42:19,593 --> 00:42:21,621
Forget it. I don't have time for that.

846
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:24,132
Come on. Please go on the blind date just this once for me.

847
00:42:24,133 --> 00:42:27,263
Byung Chul would only teach me the forkball if I set you up with him.

848
00:42:28,102 --> 00:42:31,371
Please! I must learn the technique to go back to the major league.

849
00:42:31,372 --> 00:42:34,041
Gosh, cut it out. I have no time.

850
00:42:34,042 --> 00:42:36,271
I need to earn money to open Yu Ri's Kitchen.

851
00:42:36,272 --> 00:42:39,000
Money? Then I'll give you 50 dollars.

852
00:42:39,643 --> 00:42:41,360
What do you take me for?

853
00:42:42,113 --> 00:42:44,311
100 dollars. No surtax.

854
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,481
Okay, no problem. Then you're in, right?

855
00:42:46,482 --> 00:42:48,270
I'll go ahead and arrange the blind date, then.

856
00:42:48,422 --> 00:42:49,992
Yes, it's fine.

857
00:42:49,993 --> 00:42:53,092
Okay! Now, I just need to save 49,874.20 dollars.

858
00:42:53,093 --> 00:42:55,345
Goodness, look at you with your money-making strategy.

859
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:57,503
What?

860
00:42:58,192 --> 00:42:59,303
I'm back.

861
00:42:59,933 --> 00:43:01,331
Guys, where's Soo Yeon?

862
00:43:01,332 --> 00:43:04,333
Not sure. She didn't eat all day. She's been stuck in her room.

863
00:43:05,002 --> 00:43:06,171
Oh, what's that cake for?

864
00:43:06,172 --> 00:43:07,718
Get lost. It's not for you.

865
00:43:08,402 --> 00:43:10,160
Shall I leave this in her room?

866
00:43:16,013 --> 00:43:17,365
Hey, Soo Yeon. What are you up to?

867
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,269
I bought...

868
00:43:20,953 --> 00:43:23,191
this cheesecake for you. Have some.

869
00:43:23,192 --> 00:43:24,334
You like this cake.

870
00:43:25,022 --> 00:43:28,291
Thanks, but I have no appetite right now.

871
00:43:28,292 --> 00:43:30,050
Cheer up, please.

872
00:43:30,263 --> 00:43:32,484
It's just a part-time job, you know. It's not a big deal.

873
00:43:34,033 --> 00:43:37,032
I just feel like a loser.

874
00:43:37,133 --> 00:43:38,788
A loser? What do you mean?

875
00:43:40,172 --> 00:43:42,264
I stink at housework.

876
00:43:42,573 --> 00:43:45,138
I keep making mistakes and getting fired from part-time jobs.

877
00:43:46,413 --> 00:43:48,403
I can't do anything right.

878
00:43:49,883 --> 00:43:54,367
Jun Ki, I used to think that I was very competent and bright.

879
00:43:55,953 --> 00:43:58,447
But these days, I feel as if I've turned into a complete idiot.

880
00:44:00,993 --> 00:44:02,740
How did I end up in this mess?

881
00:44:05,033 --> 00:44:08,264
I feel like the biggest idiot, and it's driving me crazy.

882
00:44:10,933 --> 00:44:15,144
And my dad isn't even around. I'm so lonely and stressed out.

883
00:44:19,312 --> 00:44:22,842
Guys, what should we do? Soo Yeon seems utterly disheartened.

884
00:44:22,843 --> 00:44:24,226
I know.

885
00:44:24,283 --> 00:44:27,222
Hey, is there anything we can do to cheer her up?

886
00:44:27,223 --> 00:44:29,203
I've done some thinking,

887
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,992
and I have a great idea.

888
00:44:30,993 --> 00:44:32,251
A great idea? What is it?

889
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:35,561
I should be her boyfriend.

890
00:44:35,562 --> 00:44:37,262
What? "Boyfriend"?

891
00:44:37,263 --> 00:44:38,807
What are you talking about?

892
00:44:38,962 --> 00:44:40,401
How is that the conclusion?

893
00:44:40,402 --> 00:44:42,079
Hey, think about it.

894
00:44:42,203 --> 00:44:43,671
Having a reliable boyfriend like me,

895
00:44:43,672 --> 00:44:46,271
who can be as sweet as her dad is,

896
00:44:46,272 --> 00:44:48,871
will help her feel less lonely and stressed out. Aren't I right?

897
00:44:48,872 --> 00:44:51,041
So since she's having a hard time,

898
00:44:51,042 --> 00:44:53,811
you'll be her boyfriend? Is that what you're saying?

899
00:44:53,812 --> 00:44:56,882
Yes. It's the least I can do for my first love.

900
00:44:56,883 --> 00:44:58,094
Hey, that's nonsense!

901
00:44:58,982 --> 00:45:01,306
Do you actually have feelings for her?

902
00:45:01,982 --> 00:45:04,322
No, but I'm going to develop feelings for her.

903
00:45:04,323 --> 00:45:05,909
What? No. No way.

904
00:45:06,152 --> 00:45:07,980
What? Who are you to say that?

905
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:11,323
Whether I have feelings for her or not, why do you even care?

906
00:45:12,093 --> 00:45:13,780
Oh, it's just...

907
00:45:15,402 --> 00:45:17,049
I think you are too good for her.

908
00:45:17,473 --> 00:45:21,180
You're so good looking, down-to-earth, and loyal.

909
00:45:23,413 --> 00:45:25,130
- And you're buff. - What?

910
00:45:25,812 --> 00:45:28,368
On top of that, you're sexy.

911
00:45:28,513 --> 00:45:30,937
Why would you go out with someone like Soo Yeon?

912
00:45:32,053 --> 00:45:35,151
- Right, Ki Bong? - I'm not sure if I agree with that.

913
00:45:35,152 --> 00:45:36,222
Yes, I'm not sure either.

914
00:45:36,223 --> 00:45:38,392
But I'm worried about us doing anything hasty...

915
00:45:38,393 --> 00:45:40,686
and hurting Soo Yeon's feelings more.

916
00:45:40,823 --> 00:45:41,904
You think so?

917
00:45:42,863 --> 00:45:44,032
Then forget what I said.

918
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:45,952
Yes, that's wise.

919
00:45:49,363 --> 00:45:52,736
Okay, don't you worry.

920
00:45:52,872 --> 00:45:55,941
I'll make sure you can learn the forkball or whatever it's called.

921
00:45:55,942 --> 00:45:56,952
I have to go.

922
00:45:57,542 --> 00:45:59,492
Gosh, he's such a nuisance.

923
00:45:59,743 --> 00:46:01,258
By the way, who is this guy I'm meeting?

924
00:46:02,712 --> 00:46:04,198
Yu Ri, over here!

925
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:07,107
My gosh, hello.

926
00:46:09,122 --> 00:46:12,592
Oh, my. He's handsome and tall.

927
00:46:12,593 --> 00:46:14,613
He's totally my type.

928
00:46:17,263 --> 00:46:19,858
I see. So you volunteer as a hobby.

929
00:46:21,133 --> 00:46:23,101
Whenever I see someone who's in need of help,

930
00:46:23,102 --> 00:46:25,532
I can't walk by without helping the person.

931
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,088
Oh, I see.

932
00:46:27,272 --> 00:46:31,171
By the way, Ki Bong told me that you're a chef.

933
00:46:31,172 --> 00:46:32,182
Yes.

934
00:46:32,272 --> 00:46:36,222
I'm the happiest when I'm cooking.

935
00:46:38,683 --> 00:46:40,905
What kind of cuisine?

936
00:46:41,283 --> 00:46:42,293
Korean food?

937
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:44,776
Western food? Chinese food? Japanese food?

938
00:46:45,122 --> 00:46:46,263
Or...

939
00:46:46,922 --> 00:46:48,073
Kevin...Bacon?

940
00:46:53,663 --> 00:46:56,864
My gosh, why does he laugh like that?

941
00:47:00,473 --> 00:47:02,421
It was a joke. You didn't find it funny?

942
00:47:02,703 --> 00:47:04,732
When I first thought of this joke, I laughed all night.

943
00:47:05,143 --> 00:47:07,941
It still cracks me up.

944
00:47:08,212 --> 00:47:10,311
What on earth? What kind of laugh is that?

945
00:47:10,312 --> 00:47:11,464
Bacon.

946
00:47:11,712 --> 00:47:13,671
What's going on? What is wrong with this man?

947
00:47:15,852 --> 00:47:17,266
My goodness, it's so embarrassing.

948
00:47:19,393 --> 00:47:21,413
- Kook Ki Bong! - Hey, you're back.

949
00:47:21,562 --> 00:47:23,592
He told me he really liked you.

950
00:47:23,593 --> 00:47:25,231
Shut it! Have you lost your mind?

951
00:47:25,232 --> 00:47:27,231
Why, you didn't like him?

952
00:47:27,232 --> 00:47:28,242
Isn't it obvious?

953
00:47:28,433 --> 00:47:30,856
Who on earth laughs like that?

954
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:33,742
I can't even imitate it.

955
00:47:33,743 --> 00:47:34,782
That's what bothered you?

956
00:47:35,172 --> 00:47:37,541
He does have a unique laugh.

957
00:47:37,542 --> 00:47:40,441
Just know that I'm not seeing him again.

958
00:47:40,442 --> 00:47:42,098
- Understood? - Yu Ri!

959
00:47:43,082 --> 00:47:44,324
I'm begging you.

960
00:47:44,513 --> 00:47:46,382
I have to learn how to throw a forkball.

961
00:47:46,383 --> 00:47:49,722
I really have to go up to the major league this time.

962
00:47:49,723 --> 00:47:52,045
Stop it. Don't try to make me feel sorry.

963
00:47:53,422 --> 00:47:55,180
Fine. Then...

964
00:47:55,363 --> 00:47:57,686
give me 50 dollars more for emotional distress.

965
00:47:57,792 --> 00:47:59,347
There's no negotiation.

966
00:47:59,593 --> 00:48:01,219
Sure, you got it.

967
00:48:02,002 --> 00:48:03,144
Thanks, Yu Ri.

968
00:48:03,602 --> 00:48:05,320
Get off of me!

969
00:48:05,502 --> 00:48:07,189
You're not a friend but a nemesis.

970
00:48:08,172 --> 00:48:09,771
Thanks, Yu Ri. I mean it.

971
00:48:09,772 --> 00:48:10,954
Yu Ri, how did the blind date go?

972
00:48:12,212 --> 00:48:13,425
- What's wrong with her? - It's nothing.

973
00:48:14,243 --> 00:48:15,293
Where's Jun Ki?

974
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,601
He went out on a date with Soo Yeon.

975
00:48:17,752 --> 00:48:19,711
What? Jun Ki and Soo Yeon are on a date?

976
00:48:19,712 --> 00:48:23,560
Yes. He said he could no longer be indifferent to her loneliness.

977
00:48:23,792 --> 00:48:25,722
He said he'd tell her how he feels about her.

978
00:48:25,723 --> 00:48:27,743
He did? That little!

979
00:48:30,093 --> 00:48:32,354
- Hey. - Where did they go? Tell me!

980
00:48:34,033 --> 00:48:35,618
- Cheers. - Cheers.

981
00:48:42,303 --> 00:48:43,383
This is delicious.

982
00:48:44,442 --> 00:48:47,240
- Thanks, Jun Ki. - No problem.

983
00:48:48,113 --> 00:48:50,211
So? Are you feeling better now?

984
00:48:50,212 --> 00:48:52,333
Yes, thanks to you.

985
00:48:53,212 --> 00:48:54,294
I'm so glad to hear that.

986
00:48:54,982 --> 00:48:57,346
You just let me know if there's anything you want to do.

987
00:48:57,453 --> 00:48:59,574
- I'll do anything for you. - Anything?

988
00:49:01,663 --> 00:49:04,016
I mean, I've been wanting to go to the beach.

989
00:49:04,332 --> 00:49:05,362
Let's go to the beach!

990
00:49:05,363 --> 00:49:07,331
No, it's okay. I was just saying.

991
00:49:07,332 --> 00:49:08,473
No?

992
00:49:09,133 --> 00:49:10,315
- Are you sure? - Yes.

993
00:49:14,042 --> 00:49:15,789
- You're acting a bit weird today. - Sorry?

994
00:49:16,042 --> 00:49:17,284
Why are you being so nice to me?

995
00:49:17,942 --> 00:49:21,012
- Did you do something wrong? - Of course not.

996
00:49:23,042 --> 00:49:26,961
Actually, there's something I want to say to you.

997
00:49:27,152 --> 00:49:28,234
There is?

998
00:49:28,953 --> 00:49:30,064
What is it?

999
00:49:30,652 --> 00:49:31,662
It's...

1000
00:49:32,622 --> 00:49:33,632
Soo Yeon.

1001
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:36,021
I...

1002
00:49:36,022 --> 00:49:38,362
- Jun Ki! - Oh my goodness.

1003
00:49:38,363 --> 00:49:39,605
My goodness.

1004
00:49:42,703 --> 00:49:45,561
Woo Shik, what are you doing here?

1005
00:49:45,902 --> 00:49:47,994
You...told me...

1006
00:49:48,303 --> 00:49:49,717
to apologize to Soo Yeon officially.

1007
00:49:49,973 --> 00:49:51,084
I did.

1008
00:49:52,913 --> 00:49:55,266
Soo Yeon. I'm sorry for yelling...

1009
00:49:55,513 --> 00:49:56,796
at you during our singing lesson.

1010
00:49:58,013 --> 00:50:01,487
And sorry for yelling at you again when you just got fired.

1011
00:50:02,352 --> 00:50:03,464
I'm truly sorry. I mean it.

1012
00:50:04,692 --> 00:50:07,117
All right. Fine.

1013
00:50:07,622 --> 00:50:09,262
She said she's fine. Off you go now.

1014
00:50:09,263 --> 00:50:10,606
- I'm not done yet. - What?

1015
00:50:11,033 --> 00:50:12,275
Soo Yeon.

1016
00:50:12,462 --> 00:50:13,573
I'm sorry.

1017
00:50:14,102 --> 00:50:15,174
I'm sorry.

1018
00:50:16,062 --> 00:50:17,144
I'm sorry.

1019
00:50:17,372 --> 00:50:18,545
I'm sorry.

1020
00:50:19,102 --> 00:50:20,284
I'm sorry.

1021
00:50:21,002 --> 00:50:23,441
That's enough. You can go now.

1022
00:50:23,442 --> 00:50:24,452
I'm sorry.

1023
00:50:24,812 --> 00:50:25,853
I'm sorry.

1024
00:50:26,643 --> 00:50:27,794
I'm sorry.

1025
00:50:29,383 --> 00:50:30,766
I'm sorry.

1026
00:50:31,812 --> 00:50:33,974
- What was that? - I'm sorry.

1027
00:50:34,553 --> 00:50:35,633
They all mean I'm sorry.

1028
00:50:37,223 --> 00:50:39,851
Cha Woo Shik, what on earth was that?

1029
00:50:39,852 --> 00:50:42,893
Who says I'm sorry in 50 different languages?

1030
00:50:42,962 --> 00:50:45,155
You ruined my chance of asking Soo Yeon out.

1031
00:50:45,393 --> 00:50:47,049
You told me to apologize to her.

1032
00:50:47,332 --> 00:50:50,534
- So I put much thought into it. - Are you kidding me?

1033
00:50:50,803 --> 00:50:53,630
You're acting super suspicious.

1034
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:56,972
You were so against it when I said I wanted to ask Soo Yeon out.

1035
00:50:56,973 --> 00:50:58,862
And you suddenly showed up at the wine bar today.

1036
00:50:59,872 --> 00:51:02,671
Hey, do you like Soo Yeon or what?

1037
00:51:03,183 --> 00:51:05,304
- Sorry? - Come on. That's nonsense.

1038
00:51:05,553 --> 00:51:07,097
Woo Shik always picks on Soo Yeon.

1039
00:51:08,683 --> 00:51:10,369
That's true. I know it's not possible.

1040
00:51:11,022 --> 00:51:12,291
Then what's wrong with you?

1041
00:51:12,292 --> 00:51:13,621
Why are you acting like this?

1042
00:51:13,622 --> 00:51:16,623
What are you talking about? I was there to apologize.

1043
00:51:17,062 --> 00:51:18,144
I'm done here!

1044
00:51:20,303 --> 00:51:21,444
It's so suspicious.

1045
00:51:22,433 --> 00:51:24,221
He's definitely hiding something.

1046
00:51:26,284 --> 00:51:28,507
I still don't get it.

1047
00:51:29,215 --> 00:51:31,345
Woo Shik's hiding something from us for sure.

1048
00:51:32,784 --> 00:51:36,057
What? Jun Ki tried to ask Soo Yeon out?

1049
00:51:36,695 --> 00:51:38,543
- But why? - I don't know.

1050
00:51:38,724 --> 00:51:40,094
What am I going to do, Yu Ri?

1051
00:51:40,095 --> 00:51:41,347
You have no choice then.

1052
00:51:41,664 --> 00:51:44,795
Tell Jun Ki honestly how you feel.

1053
00:51:49,374 --> 00:51:52,004
Would Jun Ki understand me?

1054
00:51:52,005 --> 00:51:54,702
It's not a sin to like someone.

1055
00:51:55,315 --> 00:51:56,486
I know but...

1056
00:51:56,615 --> 00:51:58,837
What if I end up ruining our friendship?

1057
00:51:58,914 --> 00:52:00,268
Are you just going to give up?

1058
00:52:00,554 --> 00:52:02,806
How long are you going to keep this secret?

1059
00:52:04,025 --> 00:52:06,751
Jun Ki will eventually find out how you feel.

1060
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,216
It's better he knows sooner than later.

1061
00:52:09,425 --> 00:52:12,656
So, just tell Jun Ki how you feel.

1062
00:52:13,124 --> 00:52:15,285
Tell him you had this feeling first.

1063
00:52:15,965 --> 00:52:17,753
That this love has been in your heart...

1064
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:19,880
since high school.

1065
00:52:20,775 --> 00:52:23,673
And that you will feel this way forever and ever.

1066
00:52:27,315 --> 00:52:28,486
Oh my gosh.

1067
00:52:38,284 --> 00:52:40,748
What's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost.

1068
00:52:40,894 --> 00:52:43,551
Ki Bong, I just found out that...

1069
00:52:45,925 --> 00:52:47,076
Woo Shik...

1070
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:51,163
- likes me. - What?

1071
00:52:51,164 --> 00:52:53,558
He has had a crush on me since high school.

1072
00:52:55,374 --> 00:52:57,768
And he'll love me forever and ever.

1073
00:52:58,244 --> 00:53:00,063
What kind of gibberish is that?

1074
00:53:00,414 --> 00:53:03,913
I accidentally overheard Yu Ri and Woo Shik's conversation.

1075
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,864
You must have heard wrong. It's ridiculous.

1076
00:53:05,985 --> 00:53:07,884
I thought so too at first.

1077
00:53:07,885 --> 00:53:09,905
But now that I think about it. it all makes perfect sense.

1078
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:12,779
Do you remember what Woo Shik said yesterday?

1079
00:53:12,925 --> 00:53:14,469
I think you are too good for her.

1080
00:53:15,755 --> 00:53:20,138
You're so good looking, down-to-earth, and loyal.

1081
00:53:21,994 --> 00:53:24,591
And you're buff. On top of that...

1082
00:53:25,104 --> 00:53:26,781
You're even sexy.

1083
00:53:27,235 --> 00:53:29,800
Why would you go out with someone like Soo Yeon?

1084
00:53:30,074 --> 00:53:32,165
I did find it a bit strange but...

1085
00:53:33,474 --> 00:53:35,073
But still...

1086
00:53:35,074 --> 00:53:38,680
Then how about he following us to the wine bar?

1087
00:53:38,845 --> 00:53:39,984
How do you explain that?

1088
00:53:39,985 --> 00:53:42,013
Would he have come because of Soo Yeon?

1089
00:53:42,014 --> 00:53:43,084
No, of course not.

1090
00:53:43,085 --> 00:53:45,346
- He hates her guts. - Exactly!

1091
00:53:45,824 --> 00:53:48,320
He came because of me.

1092
00:53:49,124 --> 00:53:52,393
- Because he loves me. - Love?

1093
00:53:52,394 --> 00:53:55,194
That's why he didn't want Soo Yeon to live with us.

1094
00:53:55,195 --> 00:53:57,456
That's why he was so mean to her.

1095
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:01,538
Because he didn't want to lose me to Soo Yeon.

1096
00:54:02,304 --> 00:54:03,445
What do you think?

1097
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:06,575
Everything falls into place now, doesn't it?

1098
00:54:06,704 --> 00:54:09,269
It really does. How could something like this happen?

1099
00:54:13,184 --> 00:54:14,225
Woo Shik...

1100
00:54:15,255 --> 00:54:18,183
Jun Ki, there's something I need to tell you.

1101
00:54:18,184 --> 00:54:20,003
No, please don't.

1102
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:21,453
Don't say anything.

1103
00:54:21,454 --> 00:54:23,646
- Hey, what's gotten into you? - Just don't say anything.

1104
00:54:24,224 --> 00:54:25,406
I have nothing to say to you.

1105
00:54:25,624 --> 00:54:26,674
Nothing!

1106
00:54:30,565 --> 00:54:32,151
What's wrong with him?

1107
00:54:32,465 --> 00:54:34,798
I'm not sure.

1108
00:54:36,304 --> 00:54:38,768
Yu Ri, do you like this place?

1109
00:54:38,905 --> 00:54:40,116
Yes.

1110
00:54:40,414 --> 00:54:43,071
I made a reservation for the table by the windows.

1111
00:54:43,244 --> 00:54:44,913
Why did you want to sit in the corner?

1112
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:46,702
It's all because of you.

1113
00:54:46,985 --> 00:54:50,146
Because you bray like a donkey in public.

1114
00:54:51,954 --> 00:54:53,500
Just because.

1115
00:54:53,824 --> 00:54:56,753
I like sitting in the corner.

1116
00:54:56,994 --> 00:54:58,842
I see.

1117
00:54:59,724 --> 00:55:01,956
Shall we look at the menu?

1118
00:55:02,934 --> 00:55:04,033
Sure.

1119
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:06,286
Their mushroom pasta is quite good.

1120
00:55:06,434 --> 00:55:07,920
By the way, Yu Ri...

1121
00:55:08,235 --> 00:55:10,904
do you know what's the shyest vegetable in the world?

1122
00:55:10,905 --> 00:55:13,631
No. What is it?

1123
00:55:15,744 --> 00:55:16,856
Mu...shy...room.

1124
00:55:18,985 --> 00:55:21,106
There he goes again.

1125
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:32,534
Then do you know what kind of music salt likes?

1126
00:55:33,065 --> 00:55:34,307
Rock...salt.

1127
00:55:36,764 --> 00:55:38,583
Rock salt.

1128
00:55:42,675 --> 00:55:43,815
Byung Chul!

1129
00:55:45,005 --> 00:55:48,207
You startled me. What's wrong, Yu Ri?

1130
00:55:48,275 --> 00:55:51,881
The thing is, I'm really sorry to tell you this,

1131
00:55:52,744 --> 00:55:54,471
but can you please stop laughing?

1132
00:55:55,284 --> 00:55:57,780
I know my laugh sounds a bit unique.

1133
00:55:58,354 --> 00:56:00,547
But I've been like this since I was born.

1134
00:56:00,795 --> 00:56:03,118
It's difficult to fix. I'm sorry.

1135
00:56:03,124 --> 00:56:04,377
It's fine.

1136
00:56:04,565 --> 00:56:09,094
I'd appreciate it if you could try holding it.

1137
00:56:09,095 --> 00:56:10,163
From now on,

1138
00:56:10,164 --> 00:56:12,993
I'll try to hold it back as much as I can when I'm with you.

1139
00:56:13,135 --> 00:56:15,256
Okay... Thank you.

1140
00:56:19,345 --> 00:56:20,416
No one's home, right?

1141
00:56:20,815 --> 00:56:21,825
All right.

1142
00:56:22,014 --> 00:56:25,276
Before I bump into Woo Shik, I'll grab my clothes and go.

1143
00:56:25,644 --> 00:56:26,654
Just my clothes.

1144
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:30,427
- Hey. - Oh, my gosh!

1145
00:56:32,054 --> 00:56:34,417
- Woo Shik. - Why are you so startled?

1146
00:56:35,994 --> 00:56:38,490
Jun Ki, I have something to tell you.

1147
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:41,057
Why don't we go somewhere quiet and have a drink?

1148
00:56:41,365 --> 00:56:42,375
A drink?

1149
00:56:42,795 --> 00:56:44,564
No! I quit drinking.

1150
00:56:44,565 --> 00:56:46,504
Really? How about some coffee then?

1151
00:56:46,505 --> 00:56:47,585
Coffee?

1152
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:49,334
No! I quit drinking coffee.

1153
00:56:49,335 --> 00:56:50,384
Even coffee?

1154
00:56:50,704 --> 00:56:52,473
Fine, let's just talk here.

1155
00:56:52,474 --> 00:56:53,515
Talk?

1156
00:56:53,604 --> 00:56:55,274
No! I quit talking.

1157
00:56:55,275 --> 00:56:56,255
What are you talking about?

1158
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:57,544
This is really important.

1159
00:56:57,545 --> 00:56:59,232
I told you I quit talking.

1160
00:57:00,315 --> 00:57:01,884
Don't come. Don't come near me.

1161
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:03,214
It will only take a second.

1162
00:57:03,215 --> 00:57:04,484
- Don't come. - What's wrong with you?

1163
00:57:04,485 --> 00:57:05,596
Don't talk to me.

1164
00:57:12,795 --> 00:57:14,209
Darn it!

1165
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:17,163
What are you trying to pull?

1166
00:57:17,164 --> 00:57:19,203
What? I'm doing this for you.

1167
00:57:19,204 --> 00:57:21,473
Woo Shik, what has gotten into you?

1168
00:57:21,474 --> 00:57:23,090
Why are you doing this to me?

1169
00:57:23,604 --> 00:57:26,373
I'm just your friend. That's all.

1170
00:57:26,374 --> 00:57:28,314
What? What are you talking about?

1171
00:57:28,315 --> 00:57:30,133
I know everything too!

1172
00:57:32,045 --> 00:57:33,903
You love me.

1173
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:37,138
What? What's that nonsense?

1174
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:39,694
What?

1175
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:42,216
What? So you're saying...

1176
00:57:42,354 --> 00:57:45,194
the person you like isn't me, but Soo Yeon?

1177
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:46,882
Keep your voice down.

1178
00:57:47,295 --> 00:57:48,982
It somehow happened.

1179
00:57:49,195 --> 00:57:50,734
I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

1180
00:57:50,735 --> 00:57:53,492
It's fine, as long as it isn't me.

1181
00:57:53,735 --> 00:57:55,825
It doesn't matter as long as it isn't me, Woo Shik.

1182
00:57:56,104 --> 00:57:57,589
What is wrong with you?

1183
00:57:57,905 --> 00:57:59,274
You must keep this a secret.

1184
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:00,729
All right.

1185
00:58:01,275 --> 00:58:04,678
From now on, I'll support you and Soo Yeon all the way.

1186
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:06,026
Don't you worry.

1187
00:58:09,684 --> 00:58:10,795
You little...

1188
00:58:13,485 --> 00:58:15,823
How was the food? Did you enjoy it?

1189
00:58:15,824 --> 00:58:19,057
Yes, it was delicious. This place is so romantic too.

1190
00:58:19,224 --> 00:58:20,881
I'm glad.

1191
00:58:21,235 --> 00:58:23,234
Let's go see a movie tomorrow.

1192
00:58:23,235 --> 00:58:24,547
I'll make the reservation.

1193
00:58:25,304 --> 00:58:26,376
Okay.

1194
00:58:27,775 --> 00:58:31,107
Gosh, I'm so happy now that he's not laughing.

1195
00:58:31,405 --> 00:58:34,171
He's handsome and well-mannered.

1196
00:58:34,374 --> 00:58:36,596
Then, shall we go now?

1197
00:58:36,815 --> 00:58:37,825
Okay.

1198
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:42,766
Byung Chul.

1199
00:58:44,224 --> 00:58:45,902
Dad, Mom.

1200
00:58:46,284 --> 00:58:47,365
Byung Eun.

1201
00:58:53,095 --> 00:58:54,548
It's nice to meet you.

1202
00:58:55,695 --> 00:58:58,835
You're much prettier than what Byung Chul told us about.

1203
00:58:58,965 --> 00:59:00,303
Thank you.

1204
00:59:00,304 --> 00:59:02,254
Is my brother nice to you?

1205
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:05,674
All he does is playing baseball, so he must be really bad at dating.

1206
00:59:05,675 --> 00:59:06,873
What are you talking about?

1207
00:59:06,874 --> 00:59:10,278
I treat Yu Ri like a total princess. Don't I?

1208
00:59:10,345 --> 00:59:13,143
What? Oh, right.

1209
00:59:13,784 --> 00:59:16,481
Anyway, I hope you see each other for a long time.

1210
00:59:17,985 --> 00:59:21,994
By the way, do you know what Actor Won Bin's favorite food is?

1211
00:59:21,994 --> 00:59:23,035
Sorry?

1212
00:59:25,065 --> 00:59:27,518
- I don't know. - It's one bean.

1213
00:59:29,335 --> 00:59:30,375
One bean?

1214
00:59:34,934 --> 00:59:37,732
What on earth? What is wrong with him?

1215
00:59:40,574 --> 00:59:44,585
This is absurd. Father and son even laugh the same way?

1216
00:59:45,085 --> 00:59:48,013
What? I don't get that joke.

1217
00:59:48,014 --> 00:59:49,353
Mom, come on.

1218
00:59:49,354 --> 00:59:52,920
If you translate 1 and bean to English, it becomes one bean.

1219
00:59:53,025 --> 00:59:56,387
That's why Won Bin's favorite food becomes one bean.

1220
00:59:56,525 --> 00:59:58,818
Oh, that's why it's one bean.

1221
01:00:00,224 --> 01:00:01,493
Mom!

1222
01:00:01,494 --> 01:00:03,514
I told you not to laugh like that.

1223
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:06,927
You're about to make me laugh too!

1224
01:00:09,574 --> 01:00:11,191
What kind of family is this?

1225
01:00:22,054 --> 01:00:23,833
(Seeking Female Part-timer)

1226
01:00:32,764 --> 01:00:34,149
I'm sorry.

1227
01:00:34,434 --> 01:00:36,787
I'm afraid you don't have enough experience.

1228
01:00:44,104 --> 01:00:45,154
Woo Shik.

1229
01:00:48,045 --> 01:00:49,186
Soo Yeon, get in.

1230
01:00:50,345 --> 01:00:51,984
What? Why?

1231
01:00:51,985 --> 01:00:54,914
We have somewhere to go. Hurry up, get in. Come on.

1232
01:00:55,085 --> 01:00:56,195
Go where?

1233
01:00:59,962 --> 01:01:01,346
Even if Ki Bong gives me...

1234
01:01:01,462 --> 01:01:04,461
a thousand, no ten thousand dollars, I'll never meet him again.

1235
01:01:04,832 --> 01:01:07,659
I'll tell Ki Bong and break up with him right away.

1236
01:01:37,192 --> 01:01:38,878
(Donkey)

1237
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:46,001
Hello?

1238
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:48,335
Yu Ri, why weren't you answering your phone?

1239
01:01:48,642 --> 01:01:51,206
Did I make a mistake today?

1240
01:01:51,442 --> 01:01:52,522
What?

1241
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:55,910
No, you didn't make any mistake.

1242
01:01:56,082 --> 01:01:58,202
I'll see you tomorrow night at the movie theater.

1243
01:01:58,781 --> 01:01:59,863
Okay.

1244
01:01:59,951 --> 01:02:04,063
(Practice Ground for Pitchers)

1245
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:16,700
What are you doing?

1246
01:02:16,701 --> 01:02:19,671
Ki Bong, if you don't make it to the major league this time,

1247
01:02:19,672 --> 01:02:21,934
I'm going to seriously kill you. Got it?

1248
01:02:22,971 --> 01:02:24,355
You little punk.

1249
01:02:27,412 --> 01:02:28,493
What was that?

1250
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:31,103
Goodness, that psycho!

1251
01:02:32,221 --> 01:02:33,636
Darn!

1252
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:37,979
- I'm home. - Hey, you're back.

1253
01:02:38,462 --> 01:02:40,021
How did the audition go?

1254
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:41,879
Well, I tried my best.

1255
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:45,400
Jun Ki, you better explain yourself.

1256
01:02:45,401 --> 01:02:48,229
- About what? - I met the assistant director...

1257
01:02:48,471 --> 01:02:50,824
and he told me our movie hasn't been canceled.

1258
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:53,740
Oh, the thing is...

1259
01:02:53,741 --> 01:02:55,429
I was fired because of my bad acting.

1260
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:57,828
Why did you lie to me?

1261
01:02:58,712 --> 01:02:59,792
Well...

1262
01:03:01,212 --> 01:03:02,828
In case you got hurt.

1263
01:03:03,281 --> 01:03:05,720
I was worried you'd give up again.

1264
01:03:05,721 --> 01:03:07,196
Why would I give up?

1265
01:03:07,321 --> 01:03:08,807
I'll never give up from now on.

1266
01:03:09,651 --> 01:03:11,207
You should've gone to the set.

1267
01:03:11,622 --> 01:03:13,320
You lost your job because of me.

1268
01:03:13,321 --> 01:03:15,312
It's all right, don't worry.

1269
01:03:15,531 --> 01:03:17,955
We ride together, we die together, right?

1270
01:03:20,502 --> 01:03:21,541
Thanks.

1271
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:24,501
Hey, I'm hungry too. Make me some ramyeon.

1272
01:03:24,502 --> 01:03:26,240
No, go make it yourself.

1273
01:03:26,241 --> 01:03:28,393
You just said we ride together and die together.

1274
01:03:28,412 --> 01:03:30,340
I wasn't talking about ramyeon, so get lost.

1275
01:03:30,341 --> 01:03:32,160
- Stop being silly. - Give me a bite.

1276
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:34,522
What are you doing?

1277
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:36,161
That's hot.

1278
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:42,071
It's been so long since I last came to the beach.

1279
01:03:42,792 --> 01:03:43,903
It's so nice.

1280
01:03:44,692 --> 01:03:47,161
Is this where you wanted to come?

1281
01:03:47,162 --> 01:03:50,060
Yes. I just wanted to come to the beach suddenly.

1282
01:03:50,392 --> 01:03:51,846
I didn't want to come alone though.

1283
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:53,311
Really?

1284
01:03:53,962 --> 01:03:56,496
I felt frustrated and wanted to come to the beach lately.

1285
01:03:56,701 --> 01:03:57,852
Is that so?

1286
01:03:59,102 --> 01:04:01,636
What an amazing coincidence. I can't believe it.

1287
01:04:03,011 --> 01:04:06,345
Anyway, thanks for bringing me here today.

1288
01:04:06,942 --> 01:04:09,072
No problem. By the way,

1289
01:04:10,011 --> 01:04:12,251
do you know what "stupid" is the abbreviation for in Korean?

1290
01:04:12,252 --> 01:04:13,291
Stupid?

1291
01:04:14,821 --> 01:04:15,950
"Treasure of the Ocean"?

1292
01:04:15,951 --> 01:04:17,639
Hey, you knew.

1293
01:04:17,922 --> 01:04:21,225
Wow, Soo Yeon. I thought you were stupid, but you're not.

1294
01:04:21,261 --> 01:04:22,776
What are you suddenly talking about?

1295
01:04:22,832 --> 01:04:25,993
You said you feel like you've become stupid lately.

1296
01:04:26,261 --> 01:04:27,676
That you've become a fool.

1297
01:04:28,401 --> 01:04:30,148
But you're not stupid at all.

1298
01:04:30,602 --> 01:04:32,289
Who cares if you're bad at housework?

1299
01:04:32,542 --> 01:04:34,966
Who cares if you make mistakes and get fired from your job?

1300
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:37,230
It was the first time for you.

1301
01:04:37,542 --> 01:04:40,409
You don't call something like that stupid.

1302
01:04:40,642 --> 01:04:42,096
You call it a "trial and error".

1303
01:04:44,051 --> 01:04:47,112
Soo Yeon, no one can do a good job...

1304
01:04:47,482 --> 01:04:50,320
right off the bat without trial and error.

1305
01:04:51,792 --> 01:04:54,114
So cheer up, please.

1306
01:04:54,591 --> 01:04:57,288
I know your dad isn't around now, but we're here for you.

1307
01:04:57,801 --> 01:05:00,831
Hey, you have five more supporters now.

1308
01:05:01,172 --> 01:05:02,413
Nothing should scare you.

1309
01:05:03,502 --> 01:05:05,864
So whenever you're stressed or burnt out,

1310
01:05:06,701 --> 01:05:08,156
feel free to lean on our shoulders.

1311
01:05:08,772 --> 01:05:10,156
Don't keep it all bottled up inside.

1312
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,232
Okay, I will. Thanks.

1313
01:05:16,912 --> 01:05:18,033
Shall we get going?

1314
01:05:18,181 --> 01:05:19,393
Sure, let's go.

1315
01:05:24,792 --> 01:05:27,145
- Where did it go? - What? What's wrong?

1316
01:05:28,162 --> 01:05:30,454
The car key is gone. I had it in my pocket.

1317
01:05:30,832 --> 01:05:31,912
What?

1318
01:05:32,801 --> 01:05:35,101
Gosh, I must've dropped it when we were walking. What should we do?

1319
01:05:35,102 --> 01:05:37,030
Hey, why are you even asking? Find it!

1320
01:05:37,031 --> 01:05:38,961
Okay, I'll look for it.

1321
01:05:39,901 --> 01:05:42,371
- This is crazy. - Gosh, what an idiot.

1322
01:05:42,372 --> 01:05:44,532
What? Did you just call me an idiot?

1323
01:05:44,781 --> 01:05:46,010
Are you done, you dimwit?

1324
01:05:46,011 --> 01:05:48,103
What? "Dimwit"?

1325
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:50,851
Yes, I'm done. You stupid blockhead.

1326
01:05:50,852 --> 01:05:52,194
What? "Stupid blockhead"?

1327
01:05:52,422 --> 01:05:54,180
I'm a stupid blockhead, not just a blockhead?

1328
01:05:54,181 --> 01:05:55,351
Yes, you stupid blockhead.

1329
01:05:55,352 --> 01:05:56,891
Gosh, you're so childish.

1330
01:05:56,892 --> 01:05:58,590
- Hurry up and find it, will you? - I'm looking.

1331
01:05:58,591 --> 01:05:59,760
Can't you help me?

1332
01:05:59,761 --> 01:06:02,257
Gosh, seriously. How are we going to go home?

1333
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:17,396
(Welcome to Waikiki 2 / Eulachacha Waikiki 2)

1334
01:06:17,942 --> 01:06:20,210
How long have you been staring at homeless people's photos?

1335
01:06:20,211 --> 01:06:21,911
I'm researching.

1336
01:06:21,912 --> 01:06:24,651
So you're an actor, and you'll be playing a homeless man?

1337
01:06:24,652 --> 01:06:27,350
I'd like to experience how the homeless live.

1338
01:06:27,351 --> 01:06:29,350
I'll be re-evaluated tomorrow for the major league.

1339
01:06:29,351 --> 01:06:30,765
So I don't have to see Byung Chul anymore?

1340
01:06:30,851 --> 01:06:32,021
Byung Chul, I have to tell you...

1341
01:06:32,022 --> 01:06:34,890
- You should run the kitchen here. - What?

1342
01:06:34,891 --> 01:06:37,191
This time, I'll be sure to join the major league.

1343
01:06:37,192 --> 01:06:38,443
Ki Bong, you're confident, right?

1344
01:06:39,631 --> 01:06:41,130
He's too ambitious for his own good.

1345
01:06:41,131 --> 01:06:43,525
The major league? That fool should really know his place.

1346
01:06:43,801 --> 01:06:44,901
What do you even know?

1347
01:06:44,902 --> 01:06:46,658
How could you call yourself his teammate? You jerk.
