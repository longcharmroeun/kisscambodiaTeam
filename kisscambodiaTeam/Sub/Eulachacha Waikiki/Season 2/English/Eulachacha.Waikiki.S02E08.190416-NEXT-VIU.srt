1
00:00:21,508 --> 00:00:23,836
- I'm glad you passed the interview. - I know.

2
00:00:23,837 --> 00:00:25,837
How about some chicken and beer tonight?

3
00:00:25,908 --> 00:00:27,112
That sounds great.

4
00:00:30,742 --> 00:00:31,804
Soo Yeon.

5
00:00:32,012 --> 00:00:34,112
Woo Shik, you're here early.

6
00:00:34,113 --> 00:00:35,895
My live performance at 5 o'clock got canceled.

7
00:00:36,782 --> 00:00:38,430
What are you staring at so blankly?

8
00:00:39,553 --> 00:00:41,303
I was just jealous.

9
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,215
Jealous of what?

10
00:00:43,523 --> 00:00:45,092
Those girls over there.

11
00:00:45,093 --> 00:00:46,522
They seem to be about my age,

12
00:00:46,523 --> 00:00:49,377
but they go to work and do what they like.

13
00:00:49,663 --> 00:00:52,134
They're moving forward in their life one step at a time.

14
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:57,448
I was wondering how long I have to work part-time like this.

15
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:01,232
It's not like I have a particular dream...

16
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:03,026
nor have talent at anything.

17
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:06,126
I just feel a bit frustrated.

18
00:01:06,673 --> 00:01:07,806
I see.

19
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:12,482
Right, didn't you say your dream was to become a news anchor?

20
00:01:12,813 --> 00:01:14,914
Well, I guess,

21
00:01:15,182 --> 00:01:17,422
but it's not easy to become a news anchor.

22
00:01:17,423 --> 00:01:18,922
What can I do now?

23
00:01:18,923 --> 00:01:21,522
Why? There are private institutes that teach you stuff like that.

24
00:01:21,523 --> 00:01:23,162
You can enroll in a class and prepare.

25
00:01:23,163 --> 00:01:25,665
Come on, I don't have money to enroll in a class like that.

26
00:01:26,563 --> 00:01:29,004
It's all right. I'll get back to work then.

27
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:43,350
3,000 dollars for 6 months?

28
00:01:43,842 --> 00:01:45,738
Why is this course so expensive?

29
00:01:47,882 --> 00:01:48,985
Where are you going, Ki Bong?

30
00:01:49,253 --> 00:01:50,900
I'm obviously heading out for my training...

31
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:55,607
Right... I got kicked out.

32
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:01,306
It's become a habit.

33
00:02:02,632 --> 00:02:03,869
I should get more sleep.

34
00:02:07,602 --> 00:02:08,839
That poor thing.

35
00:02:11,303 --> 00:02:13,404
By the way, how am I going to get the money?

36
00:02:17,383 --> 00:02:19,000
I should get some sleep first.

37
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:42,599
(A Bittersweet Life)

38
00:02:43,703 --> 00:02:44,876
Why did you do that to me?

39
00:02:48,643 --> 00:02:49,775
Tell me.

40
00:02:50,442 --> 00:02:51,587
Why did you do that to me?

41
00:02:53,353 --> 00:02:55,486
You humiliated me.

42
00:02:56,782 --> 00:02:58,091
I'm not talking about that.

43
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,995
Tell me the real reason.

44
00:03:00,692 --> 00:03:01,857
Tell me.

45
00:03:02,592 --> 00:03:03,860
Why did you do that to me?

46
00:03:04,092 --> 00:03:05,194
Tell me.

47
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:07,103
Say something!

48
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:11,488
Byung Hun's acting is awesome, don't you think?

49
00:03:11,502 --> 00:03:13,078
How can you be watching a movie now?

50
00:03:13,173 --> 00:03:14,995
Ki Bong got kicked out of his team. Aren't you worried?

51
00:03:16,972 --> 00:03:19,898
The other day, I saw him bawling his eyes out in front of his room.

52
00:03:20,143 --> 00:03:21,204
Seriously?

53
00:03:21,372 --> 00:03:24,227
I'm worried. He hasn't even been eating.

54
00:03:25,453 --> 00:03:26,648
I have no choice...

55
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:28,392
but to get involved once again.

56
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,251
Hey, I'll lift Ki Bong's spirits.

57
00:03:32,252 --> 00:03:33,452
Just trust me, okay?

58
00:03:33,453 --> 00:03:35,008
Trust you? What a joke.

59
00:03:35,092 --> 00:03:36,606
You cause trouble every time you say that!

60
00:03:37,293 --> 00:03:39,392
Don't do anything, please.

61
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:42,524
I'm telling you. I know exactly what to do.

62
00:03:42,603 --> 00:03:44,209
I told you to just trust me.

63
00:03:45,002 --> 00:03:46,102
Hold on.

64
00:03:46,103 --> 00:03:47,987
What kind of trouble will she cause this time?

65
00:03:50,442 --> 00:03:51,534
Tell me.

66
00:03:53,073 --> 00:03:55,349
Hey, what happened with the event I asked you about?

67
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:57,715
Yes, today?

68
00:03:59,252 --> 00:04:00,386
1,000 dollars?

69
00:04:01,212 --> 00:04:02,933
Okay, I'll be there.

70
00:04:03,222 --> 00:04:04,943
Yes. Thanks.

71
00:04:05,423 --> 00:04:06,556
An event?

72
00:04:06,823 --> 00:04:08,262
You said you'd rather starve than take such jobs.

73
00:04:08,263 --> 00:04:10,693
You don't need to know. I'll see you later.

74
00:04:11,023 --> 00:04:12,373
- See you. - Tell me.

75
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:13,897
Tell me what kind of event it is.

76
00:04:17,862 --> 00:04:20,686
What's the occasion? Why is the event taking place here?

77
00:04:21,073 --> 00:04:22,895
- Is it a wedding? - No.

78
00:04:23,172 --> 00:04:25,072
It's our boss' wife's birthday today.

79
00:04:25,073 --> 00:04:28,266
What? You're throwing a birthday party for her at this lounge?

80
00:04:30,612 --> 00:04:33,539
Everyone in the family must be very open-minded.

81
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,716
Let's hurry.

82
00:04:36,552 --> 00:04:39,437
Why did you do that? You should've watched your tongue.

83
00:04:39,852 --> 00:04:41,088
He beat you up to a pulp.

84
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,455
Please don't worry.

85
00:04:43,693 --> 00:04:45,310
There was a small squabble earlier.

86
00:04:45,462 --> 00:04:46,977
- Let's go. - Okay.

87
00:04:58,003 --> 00:05:00,651
Boss, the singer is here!

88
00:05:08,383 --> 00:05:10,484
Oh, hello.

89
00:05:11,893 --> 00:05:13,849
It's nice to meet you. I'm Kim Yong Pal.

90
00:05:16,222 --> 00:05:17,396
Hello.

91
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,981
Wait, Kim Yong Pal?

92
00:05:20,532 --> 00:05:21,943
The name sounds very familiar.

93
00:05:22,633 --> 00:05:24,002
Where did I hear it?

94
00:05:24,563 --> 00:05:26,768
Are you Kim Yong Pal of the Yong Pal Gang?

95
00:05:31,143 --> 00:05:32,410
I guess you saw me in the news.

96
00:05:33,013 --> 00:05:35,001
Don't believe what they say.

97
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:39,292
I'm just a hard-working businessman.

98
00:05:39,852 --> 00:05:40,986
Of course, boss.

99
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,628
I mean, sir.

100
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,952
I love my wife more than my own life,

101
00:05:45,953 --> 00:05:47,394
and it's her birthday today.

102
00:05:47,623 --> 00:05:49,342
Please sing for her...

103
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:50,861
and lift her spirits.

104
00:05:50,862 --> 00:05:52,961
She loves music very much.

105
00:05:52,962 --> 00:05:56,125
I see. Don't worry, sir!

106
00:05:58,203 --> 00:05:59,233
She's here.

107
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:01,064
Really?

108
00:06:02,003 --> 00:06:03,341
Honey!

109
00:06:06,143 --> 00:06:07,307
You're here.

110
00:06:08,482 --> 00:06:10,161
Ta-da!

111
00:06:10,243 --> 00:06:11,756
- Hello, ma'am! - Hello, ma'am!

112
00:06:12,282 --> 00:06:15,981
My gosh! Everyone is here because it's my birthday?

113
00:06:15,982 --> 00:06:17,940
Thank you so much.

114
00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:20,598
Did you get a haircut?

115
00:06:20,722 --> 00:06:23,122
My gosh, you look so cute.

116
00:06:23,123 --> 00:06:24,225
Thank you.

117
00:06:28,563 --> 00:06:29,799
Take him and shave his head off.

118
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,401
No... Boss! I'm sorry, boss!

119
00:06:32,402 --> 00:06:33,971
I only cut my hair because it was too long.

120
00:06:33,972 --> 00:06:36,312
I didn't know I would look this cute!

121
00:06:36,402 --> 00:06:38,123
I'll go get another haircut!

122
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,255
Please spare me, boss!

123
00:06:40,472 --> 00:06:41,882
I'm sorry, boss!

124
00:06:41,883 --> 00:06:43,541
Honey, why are you being like this again?

125
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:46,335
- I just complimented his haircut. - No.

126
00:06:46,953 --> 00:06:49,910
I never liked the way he looked at you.

127
00:06:50,482 --> 00:06:53,192
All right. Don't worry about it.

128
00:06:53,193 --> 00:06:55,283
Let's enjoy this party.

129
00:06:55,393 --> 00:06:58,689
Goodness. You kill me, honey.

130
00:06:59,862 --> 00:07:00,892
Let's go.

131
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:06,785
And this is the singer who's here to sing for you today.

132
00:07:06,873 --> 00:07:08,109
- Say hello. - Really?

133
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:10,323
- Nice to meet you. - Hello.

134
00:07:12,643 --> 00:07:15,290
Aren't you Shiva Woo Shik?

135
00:07:15,712 --> 00:07:17,495
You're Shiva Woo Shik from Taj Mahal, right?

136
00:07:17,842 --> 00:07:18,987
Oh, yes.

137
00:07:19,552 --> 00:07:20,682
But how do you know me?

138
00:07:20,683 --> 00:07:23,259
Oh, my goodness. It's me!

139
00:07:23,282 --> 00:07:25,252
Taj Mahal's fan club president, Kang Mi Young!

140
00:07:25,253 --> 00:07:26,952
My nickname was Shiva's Avid Fan.

141
00:07:26,953 --> 00:07:28,861
Shiva Woo Shik's Avid Fan. Don't you remember me?

142
00:07:28,862 --> 00:07:29,954
Wait, Shiva's Avid Fan...

143
00:07:30,893 --> 00:07:31,961
Mi Young?

144
00:07:31,962 --> 00:07:33,832
Yes, that's me!

145
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,069
My gosh, how long has it been?

146
00:07:36,362 --> 00:07:39,051
Gosh, Mi Young! It's been ages. How many years has it been...

147
00:07:40,902 --> 00:07:42,962
It's... It's been a while, ma'am.

148
00:07:44,003 --> 00:07:45,572
Don't call me like that, please.

149
00:07:45,573 --> 00:07:47,672
By the way, I'm so happy to see you.

150
00:07:47,673 --> 00:07:50,730
Is this actually happening? Or am I just dreaming right now?

151
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:01,791
Hey, Ki Bong. When are you going to snap out of this?

152
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:04,622
You need to eat something, or you'll starve yourself to death.

153
00:08:04,623 --> 00:08:05,765
I don't care.

154
00:08:06,493 --> 00:08:07,976
I can't play baseball anymore.

155
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:09,573
I'd rather die.

156
00:08:09,586 --> 00:08:10,461
What?

157
00:08:10,753 --> 00:08:13,167
Hey, how could you say such a thing?

158
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:16,844
I've been playing baseball since I was a little kid.

159
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:19,366
It was my everything,

160
00:08:19,513 --> 00:08:20,882
but I can't play it anymore.

161
00:08:21,172 --> 00:08:22,449
I'll never be able to do it again.

162
00:08:23,683 --> 00:08:24,949
Do you even know how that feels?

163
00:08:26,112 --> 00:08:28,658
- Still... Ki Bong. - Forget it.

164
00:08:28,823 --> 00:08:30,121
You guys are annoying me. Get out.

165
00:08:30,753 --> 00:08:32,679
- I said, get out. - Don't be like this.

166
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:35,492
I got you something delicious. Try it.

167
00:08:35,692 --> 00:08:38,321
I bought it at a handcrafted chocolate shop I know.

168
00:08:38,322 --> 00:08:40,322
The second you put this chocolate in your mouth,

169
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:44,161
all your worries and stress melt away because it's so good.

170
00:08:44,162 --> 00:08:45,307
What?

171
00:08:46,273 --> 00:08:49,704
Do you think I'll feel better after eating that stupid chocolate?

172
00:08:50,143 --> 00:08:52,481
I struggle to swallow even a single grain of rice.

173
00:08:52,773 --> 00:08:54,595
I feel as if I'm chewing sand.

174
00:08:54,643 --> 00:08:56,054
Okay, I heard you.

175
00:08:56,643 --> 00:08:59,259
What about try one of this,

176
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:01,338
then we'll stop bugging you.

177
00:09:02,623 --> 00:09:03,683
You mean it, right?

178
00:09:03,983 --> 00:09:05,702
You'll get out of my room if I eat just one.

179
00:09:07,623 --> 00:09:09,105
This is ridiculous.

180
00:09:09,562 --> 00:09:11,067
What do you take me for?

181
00:09:14,393 --> 00:09:17,082
It's good. This tastes amazing.

182
00:09:17,832 --> 00:09:19,583
How could chocolate be this delicious?

183
00:09:19,902 --> 00:09:22,993
Is it the chocolate or my tongue that's melting? I can't even tell.

184
00:09:24,003 --> 00:09:26,134
This is amazing. It's truly unbelievable.

185
00:09:26,343 --> 00:09:28,990
This taste is actually melting all my stress and worries away.

186
00:09:35,483 --> 00:09:37,099
How is it? It's good, right?

187
00:09:37,223 --> 00:09:38,973
- Don't you feel better now? - What?

188
00:09:39,623 --> 00:09:40,890
Well, it tastes okay.

189
00:09:41,452 --> 00:09:42,627
Really?

190
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:45,027
That can't be.

191
00:09:45,233 --> 00:09:47,492
I haven't seen anyone who didn't feel better after eating this.

192
00:09:47,493 --> 00:09:49,388
See? I told you it wouldn't work.

193
00:09:49,532 --> 00:09:52,489
How can this chocolate make him feel better?

194
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,838
Do you think he's a complete idiot or what?

195
00:09:56,143 --> 00:09:59,263
I'm sorry. Shall I leave this here so that you can eat it later?

196
00:10:03,082 --> 00:10:04,441
Gosh, don't.

197
00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:06,352
He's obviously not in the mood to eat chocolate.

198
00:10:06,353 --> 00:10:08,151
Just let him get some rest. Let's go.

199
00:10:08,152 --> 00:10:09,728
Come on. Let's go.

200
00:10:09,952 --> 00:10:11,055
Get some rest, Ki Bong.

201
00:10:11,123 --> 00:10:13,152
- Get some rest. - All right.

202
00:10:18,523 --> 00:10:19,696
Darn it.

203
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:26,487
- This chocolate is so good. - I know, right?

204
00:10:26,532 --> 00:10:28,386
It totally brightened up my mood.

205
00:10:28,802 --> 00:10:29,935
Right?

206
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:32,852
But it didn't make Ki Bong feel better.

207
00:10:33,013 --> 00:10:34,558
He must be feeling so dejected.

208
00:10:36,213 --> 00:10:38,170
Hey, why did you come out? Do you need anything?

209
00:10:38,243 --> 00:10:40,512
Well, I just want some water.

210
00:10:40,513 --> 00:10:42,172
Here you go. Have some water and go back to your room.

211
00:10:48,123 --> 00:10:49,873
What? They already ate all of it?

212
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:52,192
Those pigs.

213
00:10:52,993 --> 00:10:55,332
I want it. I want it so badly.

214
00:10:55,662 --> 00:10:57,311
I really want to eat it.

215
00:10:57,963 --> 00:10:59,888
I can't ask them for the last piece after all that.

216
00:11:00,273 --> 00:11:01,467
What do I do?

217
00:11:04,503 --> 00:11:07,016
Gosh. That was a mistake.

218
00:11:07,973 --> 00:11:09,382
It's okay. We can just wipe it.

219
00:11:09,383 --> 00:11:11,473
- Jun Ki, go bring a rag. - Oh, okay.

220
00:11:11,812 --> 00:11:14,151
Gosh, my clothes are all wet.

221
00:11:14,682 --> 00:11:17,258
- Here, use this. - Okay.

222
00:11:18,082 --> 00:11:21,039
Ki Bong, we'll clean up. You should get some rest.

223
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:22,895
Where did he go?

224
00:11:26,863 --> 00:11:29,439
Nice. That was so natural.

225
00:11:36,243 --> 00:11:38,508
All right. Shall I eat this now?

226
00:11:43,182 --> 00:11:44,244
Gosh, what is it?

227
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,982
What were you doing behind the door? You startled me.

228
00:11:48,983 --> 00:11:50,054
Nothing.

229
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:51,551
Why couldn't you knock?

230
00:11:51,552 --> 00:11:54,582
Wouldn't it be weird if I knock before I enter my own room?

231
00:11:55,123 --> 00:11:56,153
Gosh.

232
00:11:59,393 --> 00:12:01,215
Let me see.

233
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:03,117
Where did I put it?

234
00:12:04,103 --> 00:12:05,133
Where is it?

235
00:12:07,273 --> 00:12:09,095
- Get some good rest. - Okay.

236
00:12:11,243 --> 00:12:12,304
Goodness, what is it?

237
00:12:12,713 --> 00:12:13,845
I almost stepped on it.

238
00:12:14,572 --> 00:12:15,644
What is it?

239
00:12:19,152 --> 00:12:21,212
Chocolate? What is it doing here?

240
00:12:23,223 --> 00:12:26,550
Did you bring it here to eat it?

241
00:12:27,253 --> 00:12:28,283
No.

242
00:12:30,593 --> 00:12:33,003
Of course not. You said you had no appetite.

243
00:12:33,032 --> 00:12:34,166
Exactly.

244
00:12:34,763 --> 00:12:36,132
Give it to me. Let me throw it away.

245
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:37,337
You will?

246
00:12:39,032 --> 00:12:41,474
Why would you throw it away? It'd be a waste. I'll eat it.

247
00:12:43,942 --> 00:12:45,004
It's so sweet.

248
00:12:51,343 --> 00:12:53,033
Darn it.

249
00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:03,092
Woo Shik, you haven't changed a bit.

250
00:13:03,093 --> 00:13:04,772
You're still so handsome.

251
00:13:05,692 --> 00:13:07,310
No, I'm not.

252
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:12,063
It was my dream to marry you.

253
00:13:15,473 --> 00:13:17,089
What did you like so much about that punk...

254
00:13:20,273 --> 00:13:22,066
What did you like so much about that gentleman?

255
00:13:22,983 --> 00:13:24,681
His singing, of course.

256
00:13:24,682 --> 00:13:27,712
Woo Shik is such an amazing singer.

257
00:13:27,713 --> 00:13:28,989
His singing?

258
00:13:30,282 --> 00:13:32,416
I consider myself a pretty good singer too.

259
00:13:32,552 --> 00:13:35,191
You're pretty good too,

260
00:13:35,192 --> 00:13:38,356
but you can't compare to Woo Shik.

261
00:13:38,593 --> 00:13:39,664
Is that so?

262
00:13:39,893 --> 00:13:43,468
Why don't we find out who sings better?

263
00:13:45,263 --> 00:13:47,394
- We'll bet a finger. - A finger?

264
00:13:49,343 --> 00:13:51,505
Relax, I was joking.

265
00:13:52,513 --> 00:13:55,089
The winner will flick the loser on the forehead.

266
00:13:55,343 --> 00:13:56,414
How does that sound?

267
00:13:56,713 --> 00:13:58,142
Well, I'm not sure...

268
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,905
What are you waiting for? Get things ready.

269
00:14:00,182 --> 00:14:01,727
- Yes, boss! - Yes, boss!

270
00:14:04,082 --> 00:14:07,904
All right. Let me sing first.

271
00:14:08,253 --> 00:14:09,943
You know my wife's favorite song, right?

272
00:14:09,993 --> 00:14:11,023
Yes, boss.

273
00:14:14,093 --> 00:14:16,224
("Playing with Fire")

274
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,304
"Playing with Fire"?

275
00:14:23,843 --> 00:14:26,372
My mom told me every day

276
00:14:26,373 --> 00:14:28,811
To always be careful of guys

277
00:14:28,812 --> 00:14:32,625
Our love is like playing with fire

278
00:14:34,782 --> 00:14:37,770
My love is on fire

279
00:14:47,062 --> 00:14:49,267
You should practice more.

280
00:14:50,332 --> 00:14:51,362
(Do better next time.)

281
00:14:52,402 --> 00:14:55,153
Oh, what a disappointment.

282
00:14:55,802 --> 00:14:57,244
Only 65 points?

283
00:14:58,042 --> 00:15:00,999
Woo Shik, it's your turn.

284
00:15:08,353 --> 00:15:09,414
I'm in trouble.

285
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:13,378
He seems to be the extremely jealous type.

286
00:15:13,922 --> 00:15:17,013
If I end up winning, he might even kill me.

287
00:15:17,593 --> 00:15:18,798
I have to lose.

288
00:15:20,263 --> 00:15:21,570
Which song should I sing?

289
00:15:23,463 --> 00:15:24,905
Okay, this would do.

290
00:15:26,172 --> 00:15:27,306
("Pheasant Hunting")

291
00:15:28,032 --> 00:15:30,901
Pheasant

292
00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:33,314
Pheasant

293
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:38,339
Pheasant, pheasant, pheasant Let's go pheasant hunting

294
00:15:41,113 --> 00:15:44,244
Let's go pheasant hunting

295
00:15:51,223 --> 00:15:52,592
(A new singer is born.)

296
00:15:52,593 --> 00:15:55,652
100 out of 100. Congratulations!

297
00:16:24,062 --> 00:16:26,771
The chocolate box must be around here somewhere.

298
00:16:28,332 --> 00:16:31,114
Darn it. I should have checked the name of the shop.

299
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:33,486
I'm so stupid.

300
00:16:36,343 --> 00:16:37,404
Gosh!

301
00:16:38,172 --> 00:16:39,760
What are you doing here?

302
00:16:40,143 --> 00:16:42,233
Why are you going through the trash?

303
00:16:42,843 --> 00:16:44,635
I'm looking for something.

304
00:16:45,483 --> 00:16:49,089
By the way, the chocolate box from earlier...

305
00:16:49,282 --> 00:16:51,076
Where did you put it?

306
00:16:51,182 --> 00:16:52,636
Oh, that sweet chocolate?

307
00:16:53,393 --> 00:16:54,557
But why do you need that box?

308
00:16:57,723 --> 00:17:00,267
I just thought it'd be perfect for keeping business cards.

309
00:17:00,363 --> 00:17:02,186
Business cards?

310
00:17:02,332 --> 00:17:03,362
But you don't have any.

311
00:17:03,363 --> 00:17:04,962
Who knows I'll have them in the future?

312
00:17:04,963 --> 00:17:06,702
Do you think I'll stay unemployed for the rest of my life?

313
00:17:06,703 --> 00:17:08,113
That's not what I meant.

314
00:17:08,372 --> 00:17:10,472
Hey, when you get a job,

315
00:17:10,473 --> 00:17:12,472
I'll get you a really nice business card holder.

316
00:17:12,473 --> 00:17:13,541
Don't you worry.

317
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:16,412
Hey! Did you say a business card holder?

318
00:17:16,413 --> 00:17:19,452
That's just a waste.

319
00:17:19,453 --> 00:17:22,182
By reusing that chocolate box, I can save trees,

320
00:17:22,183 --> 00:17:23,381
reduce trash,

321
00:17:23,382 --> 00:17:25,825
and even prevent global warming. How nice would that be?

322
00:17:26,153 --> 00:17:28,316
So tell me where that box is.

323
00:17:28,653 --> 00:17:30,492
It's a trash pickup day, so we already took it out.

324
00:17:30,493 --> 00:17:32,316
- Out where? - What do you mean?

325
00:17:33,362 --> 00:17:35,217
But when I went out, it was already gone.

326
00:17:35,362 --> 00:17:36,465
What?

327
00:17:37,032 --> 00:17:39,990
Why did you have to take it out so early?

328
00:17:40,273 --> 00:17:42,902
- What were you thinking? - What?

329
00:17:42,903 --> 00:17:45,210
Do you have any affection for our planet?

330
00:17:45,503 --> 00:17:47,780
- You clean up here. - Why do I have to...

331
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:51,763
Why is he making such a fuss over a chocolate box?

332
00:17:58,223 --> 00:17:59,562
This is driving me crazy.

333
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:01,602
Why did he have to throw it away?

334
00:18:02,622 --> 00:18:04,519
I'm craving that chocolate so much.

335
00:18:05,493 --> 00:18:08,480
Without knowing the name of the shop, I can't get any more.

336
00:18:08,763 --> 00:18:11,545
Right. Yu Ri bought the chocolate.

337
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:13,556
She could tell me.

338
00:18:20,342 --> 00:18:21,742
Leave a message...

339
00:18:21,743 --> 00:18:23,122
Why isn't she picking up?

340
00:18:23,413 --> 00:18:24,926
Why?

341
00:18:29,552 --> 00:18:31,789
He's angry. He's definitely angry. I'm sure.

342
00:18:32,122 --> 00:18:33,327
Should I just run away?

343
00:18:33,723 --> 00:18:35,339
What about Soo Yeon's tuition fees?

344
00:18:35,923 --> 00:18:37,983
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

345
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,791
Oh, right. Woo Shik.

346
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:42,732
Do you remember the time when you went camping with the fan club?

347
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:43,794
What?

348
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:47,464
Oh, yes. I remember it.

349
00:18:47,602 --> 00:18:50,071
You played pop-up pirate...

350
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:51,752
against 40 fans,

351
00:18:51,802 --> 00:18:55,449
and you never lost once.

352
00:18:55,882 --> 00:18:57,974
Did I?

353
00:18:58,082 --> 00:18:59,781
Yes.

354
00:18:59,782 --> 00:19:02,722
You're not only handsome...

355
00:19:02,723 --> 00:19:04,844
but also super lucky.

356
00:19:06,253 --> 00:19:08,663
Is that right? You're that lucky?

357
00:19:09,193 --> 00:19:11,326
But I tend to be pretty lucky too.

358
00:19:16,963 --> 00:19:20,507
I've been stabbed about 40 times so far.

359
00:19:21,273 --> 00:19:22,889
And I'm still alive.

360
00:19:23,102 --> 00:19:25,101
Is that right?

361
00:19:25,443 --> 00:19:27,945
That's truly amazing.

362
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:33,932
Why don't we find out who is luckier?

363
00:19:34,213 --> 00:19:35,284
This time...

364
00:19:37,082 --> 00:19:38,452
10 flicks.

365
00:19:38,453 --> 00:19:40,851
10 flicks? Well, I'm not sure...

366
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:42,891
What are you waiting for? Get things ready.

367
00:19:42,892 --> 00:19:44,263
- Yes, boss! - Yes, boss!

368
00:19:47,463 --> 00:19:48,873
I have to lose this time.

369
00:19:49,233 --> 00:19:50,402
No matter what.

370
00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:53,601
If I win again, this will be my last day on earth.

371
00:19:53,602 --> 00:19:56,560
All right. Who wants to go first?

372
00:19:56,602 --> 00:19:59,178
Roulette. It's a game of odds.

373
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:02,224
It's always smart to go first. Then...

374
00:20:02,443 --> 00:20:04,030
You go first.

375
00:20:04,112 --> 00:20:05,905
You're older than me.

376
00:20:07,983 --> 00:20:09,570
That sounds good.

377
00:20:11,983 --> 00:20:14,362
All right. Here I go.

378
00:20:14,653 --> 00:20:15,899
That's it.

379
00:20:16,263 --> 00:20:17,692
Unless he's the unluckiest person in the world,

380
00:20:17,693 --> 00:20:19,340
he can't possibly lose on the first try...

381
00:21:08,473 --> 00:21:10,089
My life comes before money.

382
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:11,822
I have to get out of here.

383
00:21:11,943 --> 00:21:12,984
Hey!

384
00:21:13,552 --> 00:21:14,613
You.

385
00:21:15,582 --> 00:21:18,581
Where are you going in such a hurry? You didn't even say goodbye.

386
00:21:18,582 --> 00:21:20,096
Well...

387
00:21:20,923 --> 00:21:23,462
I think I left the stove on.

388
00:21:23,463 --> 00:21:26,317
But we have matters to settle first.

389
00:21:26,632 --> 00:21:27,694
"Matters to settle"?

390
00:21:29,963 --> 00:21:31,404
Don't you know what I mean?

391
00:21:31,503 --> 00:21:33,696
Please let me go. Please.

392
00:21:34,332 --> 00:21:35,403
Stop!

393
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:37,732
I haven't paid you yet.

394
00:21:38,072 --> 00:21:39,411
I'm home.

395
00:21:43,642 --> 00:21:44,816
Is everyone asleep?

396
00:21:45,882 --> 00:21:47,253
I'm so tired.

397
00:21:48,582 --> 00:21:50,096
I better go to bed.

398
00:21:55,892 --> 00:21:58,022
My goodness, you scared me.

399
00:21:58,023 --> 00:22:00,537
Yu Ri, where have you been all this time?

400
00:22:00,993 --> 00:22:03,538
I was doing some market research regarding Yu Ri's Kitchen.

401
00:22:03,602 --> 00:22:04,695
Why?

402
00:22:06,773 --> 00:22:08,040
But why didn't you answer your phone?

403
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:09,820
Do you know how many times I called you?

404
00:22:11,673 --> 00:22:14,290
I'm sorry. My battery died.

405
00:22:14,812 --> 00:22:16,255
But do you have something to say to me?

406
00:22:17,042 --> 00:22:20,072
Well... That chocolate you gave me earlier.

407
00:22:20,282 --> 00:22:21,590
Where did you get that from?

408
00:22:21,683 --> 00:22:23,682
What? Why do you want to know?

409
00:22:23,683 --> 00:22:25,476
I need a chocolate box.

410
00:22:25,723 --> 00:22:27,492
I need something to put my business cards in.

411
00:22:27,493 --> 00:22:29,621
Business cards? You don't have a business card.

412
00:22:29,622 --> 00:22:31,477
I might make one soon!

413
00:22:31,822 --> 00:22:34,831
Why does everyone think I'll be unemployed forever?

414
00:22:34,832 --> 00:22:36,561
Do I look that incompetent?

415
00:22:36,562 --> 00:22:39,283
No, it's not that.

416
00:22:39,703 --> 00:22:41,432
If you get a job, I'll buy you a business card holder...

417
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:44,121
No way. I told you that's a waste!

418
00:22:44,273 --> 00:22:45,715
It's environmental destruction!

419
00:22:45,773 --> 00:22:48,039
So just tell me the name of the shop.

420
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:49,733
Just tell me the name!

421
00:22:50,443 --> 00:22:52,678
Why are you getting angry?

422
00:22:54,183 --> 00:22:57,139
Can't you just use another box?

423
00:22:57,253 --> 00:23:00,621
- I have a box that's just that... - It's just that I really love...

424
00:23:00,622 --> 00:23:04,610
the design and color of that particular box!

425
00:23:04,763 --> 00:23:06,338
What's so complicated about that?

426
00:23:06,362 --> 00:23:08,217
Just tell me the name!

427
00:23:08,663 --> 00:23:11,074
Okay. Fine, I'll tell you.

428
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:14,371
I'll write down the name and address of that place...

429
00:23:14,372 --> 00:23:15,670
and send you a text.

430
00:23:16,473 --> 00:23:19,460
Okay. But is that place open right now?

431
00:23:19,513 --> 00:23:20,742
What time does it close?

432
00:23:20,743 --> 00:23:22,081
- You're going to go now? - Yes.

433
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,242
It's closed. Do you even know what time it is?

434
00:23:24,243 --> 00:23:27,066
You should have come home earlier.

435
00:23:27,352 --> 00:23:29,928
Just send me the text. Now!

436
00:23:32,852 --> 00:23:36,591
Why's he getting so angry about a darn box?

437
00:23:36,592 --> 00:23:37,859
- Help! - Oh my gosh!

438
00:23:39,532 --> 00:23:40,830
What's the matter with you?

439
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:43,762
Yu Ri, if someone looks for me, tell them I'm not here.

440
00:23:43,763 --> 00:23:45,348
Tell them I moved to another country, okay?

441
00:23:57,582 --> 00:23:58,674
My goodness.

442
00:24:02,282 --> 00:24:03,384
Brother.

443
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,781
What are you doing under there?

444
00:24:05,782 --> 00:24:07,678
Yu Ri, pass me the milk.

445
00:24:08,693 --> 00:24:10,821
By any chance, did anyone come looking for me?

446
00:24:10,822 --> 00:24:11,893
No.

447
00:24:12,763 --> 00:24:14,173
What is wrong with you?

448
00:24:14,792 --> 00:24:16,462
Did something go wrong at yesterday's event?

449
00:24:16,463 --> 00:24:19,697
What? No, it's nothing.

450
00:24:21,332 --> 00:24:23,197
- Where's Soo Yeon? - She has no appetite.

451
00:24:23,273 --> 00:24:25,435
She's feeling down these past few days.

452
00:24:25,602 --> 00:24:26,777
Is something bothering her?

453
00:24:31,082 --> 00:24:34,586
Where did Ki Bong go so early without even eating breakfast?

454
00:24:36,653 --> 00:24:38,064
I can finally eat it.

455
00:24:38,322 --> 00:24:40,922
It's moist on the outside, and sweet on the inside.

456
00:24:40,923 --> 00:24:42,571
That super delicious chocolate!

457
00:24:44,263 --> 00:24:45,354
It's here.

458
00:24:48,392 --> 00:24:49,537
What on earth?

459
00:24:53,203 --> 00:24:54,644
Excuse me, sir.

460
00:24:55,733 --> 00:24:57,391
What are you lined up for?

461
00:24:58,773 --> 00:25:00,493
We're waiting to buy chocolate.

462
00:25:00,642 --> 00:25:02,172
This place is really famous.

463
00:25:02,173 --> 00:25:03,892
You can't buy it if you don't wait in line.

464
00:25:04,683 --> 00:25:07,952
Wait. You can't buy it? What do you mean?

465
00:25:07,953 --> 00:25:09,570
They only sell a limited amount of chocolate.

466
00:25:09,582 --> 00:25:11,684
If they sell everything, they close down for the day.

467
00:25:11,753 --> 00:25:12,854
What?

468
00:25:14,352 --> 00:25:15,558
Darn it.

469
00:25:15,592 --> 00:25:17,168
That means I might not be able to buy it.

470
00:25:18,122 --> 00:25:21,286
No way, this can't be. No!

471
00:25:23,302 --> 00:25:24,807
I really want to eat it.

472
00:25:31,372 --> 00:25:32,506
Darn.

473
00:25:33,112 --> 00:25:35,688
I hope he doesn't get revenge just because I flicked his forehead.

474
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:39,000
I can't even work because I feel so worried.

475
00:25:39,382 --> 00:25:41,474
Where will I get the money for Soo Yeon's tuition?

476
00:25:45,122 --> 00:25:46,287
I don't know this number.

477
00:25:50,463 --> 00:25:52,162
Hello?

478
00:25:52,163 --> 00:25:53,780
Woo Shik, it's me, Mi Young.

479
00:25:54,562 --> 00:25:56,664
Who? Mi Young. No...

480
00:25:56,903 --> 00:25:58,101
Ma'am.

481
00:25:58,102 --> 00:26:00,441
Don't call me like that.

482
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:01,902
Why did you call me?

483
00:26:01,903 --> 00:26:04,141
You forgot your money for your performance yesterday.

484
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:05,972
I called to tell to take your money.

485
00:26:05,973 --> 00:26:07,041
Right, the money.

486
00:26:07,042 --> 00:26:09,581
Well, do you want to come over right now?

487
00:26:09,582 --> 00:26:10,716
What? To your home?

488
00:26:10,913 --> 00:26:12,561
No, can't you just wire me the money?

489
00:26:12,582 --> 00:26:15,252
But your guitar is at my house right now.

490
00:26:15,253 --> 00:26:16,798
Right, I left my guitar behind too.

491
00:26:17,153 --> 00:26:18,621
Can you send it by express...

492
00:26:18,622 --> 00:26:20,199
Is it because of my husband?

493
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:23,722
My husband went out on business, so just come and take it, okay?

494
00:26:23,723 --> 00:26:25,679
Ma'am? Hello, ma'am?

495
00:26:26,263 --> 00:26:29,147
Shoot. I don't want to go there.

496
00:26:29,903 --> 00:26:31,097
I'm scared.

497
00:26:33,673 --> 00:26:34,806
Come on in.

498
00:26:36,872 --> 00:26:38,623
- What's that mask for? - What?

499
00:26:38,743 --> 00:26:41,111
I caught a cold.

500
00:26:42,542 --> 00:26:44,365
Where is my guitar?

501
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:46,217
It's over there.

502
00:26:49,822 --> 00:26:50,914
Goodbye, then.

503
00:26:51,023 --> 00:26:53,051
Wait, you should take your money.

504
00:26:53,052 --> 00:26:54,227
Wait right here.

505
00:27:00,132 --> 00:27:02,120
Here's the money. It's 1,000 dollars, right?

506
00:27:03,132 --> 00:27:05,262
Thank you. Have a good day.

507
00:27:05,263 --> 00:27:07,334
What? You're leaving already?

508
00:27:07,602 --> 00:27:09,641
I have some urgent business to attend to.

509
00:27:09,642 --> 00:27:10,776
What is it?

510
00:27:11,703 --> 00:27:13,242
I need to make some money.

511
00:27:13,243 --> 00:27:15,168
- How much? - Now...

512
00:27:15,713 --> 00:27:17,012
I need about 2,000 more.

513
00:27:17,013 --> 00:27:18,660
- Should I give you that money? - What?

514
00:27:19,443 --> 00:27:20,690
Why would you give me money?

515
00:27:21,213 --> 00:27:22,452
That's not right.

516
00:27:22,453 --> 00:27:25,321
Then let's say I lent it to you.

517
00:27:25,322 --> 00:27:27,252
You can pay me back later when you can.

518
00:27:27,253 --> 00:27:28,354
Still, that sounds a bit...

519
00:27:28,953 --> 00:27:31,333
But why are you being so nice to me?

520
00:27:31,362 --> 00:27:32,962
What are you talking about?

521
00:27:32,963 --> 00:27:34,992
Don't you know I was the president of your fan club?

522
00:27:35,032 --> 00:27:38,202
If my singer is going through trouble, I should help.

523
00:27:38,203 --> 00:27:39,295
I'm not a singer.

524
00:27:39,463 --> 00:27:41,232
I'm just a small-time entertainer...

525
00:27:41,233 --> 00:27:42,972
who sings at other's birthday parties.

526
00:27:42,973 --> 00:27:44,141
What are you talking about?

527
00:27:44,142 --> 00:27:46,924
To me, you're a star for life.

528
00:27:46,943 --> 00:27:48,772
I'm your fan until the day that I die.

529
00:27:48,773 --> 00:27:51,141
I'll be your fan forever, so cheer up!

530
00:27:51,142 --> 00:27:53,450
- Thank you. - Don't mention it.

531
00:27:54,082 --> 00:27:55,556
Gosh, how rude of me.

532
00:27:56,653 --> 00:27:58,229
I'll get you something to drink.

533
00:28:01,792 --> 00:28:03,823
My fan until the day she dies?

534
00:28:04,862 --> 00:28:06,264
Just hearing that makes me happy.

535
00:28:07,493 --> 00:28:10,331
All right, Woo Shik. You should think about your fans...

536
00:28:10,332 --> 00:28:11,435
and hang in there.

537
00:28:11,832 --> 00:28:13,966
Woo Shik, do you like sweet rice punch?

538
00:28:20,342 --> 00:28:23,052
Goodness. I'm so sorry.

539
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,766
Okay, I'm almost there.

540
00:28:30,923 --> 00:28:32,705
I'll be able to eat it soon.

541
00:28:35,153 --> 00:28:36,286
It looks so good.

542
00:28:36,723 --> 00:28:40,192
I'm sorry, but all the chocolate we prepared have been sold out.

543
00:28:40,193 --> 00:28:42,428
We'll have to close business for today.

544
00:28:48,273 --> 00:28:50,024
(All the chocolate have been sold out.)

545
00:29:14,233 --> 00:29:16,046
I'm sorry. It's sticky, isn't it?

546
00:29:16,292 --> 00:29:18,807
This belongs to my husband. Change and come out, okay?

547
00:29:19,233 --> 00:29:20,334
Okay.

548
00:29:25,903 --> 00:29:27,149
What is this mess?

549
00:29:27,713 --> 00:29:29,906
Let's change and get out of here.

550
00:29:33,253 --> 00:29:36,271
Honey. When did you come home?

551
00:29:36,552 --> 00:29:39,551
Just now. But why are you so startled?

552
00:29:39,552 --> 00:29:42,993
What? Oh, it's nothing.

553
00:29:43,092 --> 00:29:44,257
I'm not startled.

554
00:29:44,392 --> 00:29:46,597
I thought you were at the archery center.

555
00:29:47,032 --> 00:29:48,371
Why are you back already?

556
00:29:48,532 --> 00:29:52,061
It's just that my forehead felt so sore.

557
00:29:52,062 --> 00:29:53,547
I was having a bad shooting day.

558
00:29:53,872 --> 00:29:56,169
I shouldn't have let that punk go like that.

559
00:29:58,542 --> 00:30:02,148
Honey, you must be tired. You should go inside and take a nap.

560
00:30:02,572 --> 00:30:03,819
Hold on.

561
00:30:04,743 --> 00:30:06,566
I should still wipe my bow.

562
00:30:15,392 --> 00:30:17,762
Ma'am, this doesn't fit...

563
00:30:19,993 --> 00:30:21,538
Sir.

564
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:23,061
What are you doing here?

565
00:30:23,062 --> 00:30:24,196
That's my suit.

566
00:30:25,602 --> 00:30:28,076
Hold on. Did you take a shower?

567
00:30:28,773 --> 00:30:30,009
No, that's not it.

568
00:30:30,102 --> 00:30:33,071
She just spilled sweet rice punch on my face. All over here...

569
00:30:33,072 --> 00:30:36,267
- Right. He's telling the truth. - Shut it!

570
00:30:36,743 --> 00:30:38,431
Do you expect me to believe that?

571
00:30:38,542 --> 00:30:40,111
- You're mistaken. - You're mistaken.

572
00:30:40,112 --> 00:30:42,172
Mistaken, my foot!

573
00:30:43,052 --> 00:30:44,980
I caught you on the scene!

574
00:30:47,453 --> 00:30:49,204
I won't let it slide this time.

575
00:30:50,622 --> 00:30:51,861
- Come over here. - You're mistaken.

576
00:30:51,862 --> 00:30:54,438
- Come over here. - Okay!

577
00:30:55,263 --> 00:30:57,425
I'll tell you the truth. Actually...

578
00:30:59,302 --> 00:31:01,393
He suddenly barged in here.

579
00:31:03,203 --> 00:31:04,305
What?

580
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:09,662
What? What are you talking about all of a sudden?

581
00:31:09,983 --> 00:31:11,734
But it's true.

582
00:31:11,743 --> 00:31:13,912
I said no, but he found out where I lived.

583
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,281
He asked me for a cup of sweet rice punch, so I did.

584
00:31:16,282 --> 00:31:19,621
You suddenly poured it all over yourself on purpose, didn't you?

585
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:21,884
No...

586
00:31:22,552 --> 00:31:24,375
No, that's not true.

587
00:31:24,493 --> 00:31:26,481
- You little... - No...

588
00:31:43,612 --> 00:31:46,086
I bought it! I finally got my hands on it.

589
00:31:46,382 --> 00:31:47,444
Wait, hold on.

590
00:31:47,913 --> 00:31:50,046
I shouldn't eat this at home because I don't want to get caught.

591
00:31:50,552 --> 00:31:52,716
I have no choice. I should just eat it before I head home.

592
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:02,740

593
00:32:07,032 --> 00:32:09,871
Mister! Please throw the ball over.

594
00:32:09,872 --> 00:32:10,902
Okay.

595
00:32:27,052 --> 00:32:28,186
Thank you.

596
00:32:50,882 --> 00:32:52,284
Kook Ki Bong's wicked pitch.

597
00:32:52,413 --> 00:32:54,721
Thunderbolt, fire!

598
00:32:55,253 --> 00:32:57,858
Another strike. Strikeout!

599
00:32:57,882 --> 00:33:00,291
This no-hitter game makes Kook Ki Bong...

600
00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:02,929
the champion of the World Series!

601
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:14,152
Ki Bong, what are you doing here?

602
00:33:17,403 --> 00:33:20,041
What? I wondered where you went so early in the morning.

603
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:21,690
You went to buy the box of chocolate?

604
00:33:24,183 --> 00:33:26,685
Hey, why do you look so sad?

605
00:33:29,483 --> 00:33:31,276
Those kids remind me of when I was little.

606
00:33:32,183 --> 00:33:34,150
My friends and I always played like that.

607
00:33:34,923 --> 00:33:37,499
Back then, I had no idea I'd end up like this.

608
00:33:39,723 --> 00:33:40,764
Yu Ri.

609
00:33:41,892 --> 00:33:43,201
What should I do now?

610
00:33:44,032 --> 00:33:45,340
How am I going to live from now on?

611
00:33:48,903 --> 00:33:50,695
I wish someone could just tell me what to do.

612
00:33:58,183 --> 00:33:59,244
Ki Bong.

613
00:34:00,013 --> 00:34:02,866
I heard this in a movie that I watched.

614
00:34:02,983 --> 00:34:04,115
Apparently, life is...

615
00:34:05,282 --> 00:34:07,178
just like that box of chocolate.

616
00:34:09,492 --> 00:34:12,450
Some chocolates in the box are sweet,

617
00:34:12,792 --> 00:34:14,955
but there are also bitter ones.

618
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:16,944
So baseball was...

619
00:34:18,733 --> 00:34:21,659
a bitter chocolate in your life.

620
00:34:23,003 --> 00:34:25,680
It was too bitter to swallow.

621
00:34:26,003 --> 00:34:27,279
That kind of chocolate.

622
00:34:28,972 --> 00:34:30,900
But you still have...

623
00:34:31,512 --> 00:34:33,543
many other chocolates left in the box.

624
00:34:37,352 --> 00:34:39,444
Your baseball career is over,

625
00:34:40,122 --> 00:34:41,255
but your life...

626
00:34:41,852 --> 00:34:44,809
isn't over yet, you know?

627
00:34:46,023 --> 00:34:49,360
So if you pick another chocolate,

628
00:34:49,492 --> 00:34:51,109
a different path may open up, don't you think?

629
00:34:51,662 --> 00:34:53,485
What if that chocolate is also bitter?

630
00:34:55,602 --> 00:34:58,869
If that happens, you'll just have to...

631
00:34:59,573 --> 00:35:02,942
pick another chocolate in the box.

632
00:35:02,943 --> 00:35:05,003
- What if that one is bitter too? - You punk, seriously.

633
00:35:06,142 --> 00:35:07,245
Forget it.

634
00:35:08,253 --> 00:35:10,240
I was trying to have a serious conversation with you.

635
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:12,991
I was just kidding.

636
00:35:14,992 --> 00:35:16,878
So you're saying...

637
00:35:17,523 --> 00:35:20,417
I still have other chocolates to choose from, right?

638
00:35:26,363 --> 00:35:28,201
Hey. I can have one, right?

639
00:35:28,202 --> 00:35:31,643
No, you can't. I went through hoops to get this.

640
00:35:31,702 --> 00:35:33,010
I must eat it all by myself.

641
00:35:33,773 --> 00:35:35,318
Gosh, you're so greedy.

642
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:38,741
Hang on. What is going on here?

643
00:35:38,742 --> 00:35:40,948
You said the chocolate wasn't good. I guess you liked it.

644
00:35:41,312 --> 00:35:43,002
Right? It's good, isn't it?

645
00:35:43,113 --> 00:35:44,803
Gosh, you obviously like it.

646
00:35:45,523 --> 00:35:48,479
Hey, give me one. You greedy pig.

647
00:35:48,523 --> 00:35:50,727
No way! I'll eat this all by myself.

648
00:35:51,162 --> 00:35:53,562
Hey! I got you those chocolates in the first place.

649
00:35:54,392 --> 00:35:55,670
Go ahead and take it if you can.

650
00:35:56,062 --> 00:35:57,298
You don't think I can do it?

651
00:35:58,363 --> 00:36:00,331
How will you reach this? You'll never...

652
00:36:18,622 --> 00:36:19,787
My gosh, Woo Shik.

653
00:36:20,852 --> 00:36:22,263
What are you doing here?

654
00:36:22,392 --> 00:36:23,659
Why did you do that to me?

655
00:36:24,722 --> 00:36:26,782
Tell me. Why did you do that to me?

656
00:36:26,832 --> 00:36:28,862
You humiliated me.

657
00:36:28,863 --> 00:36:30,450
That's total nonsense.

658
00:36:32,162 --> 00:36:35,223
Don't give me that. Tell me the real reason.

659
00:36:35,972 --> 00:36:37,446
I've been racking my brain,

660
00:36:38,573 --> 00:36:39,881
but I really can't figure it out.

661
00:36:40,472 --> 00:36:42,017
Were you really trying to kill me?

662
00:36:42,943 --> 00:36:44,426
Did you actually want to get me killed?

663
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,251
You said you'd be on my side until you die!

664
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:51,185
Tell me.

665
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:53,973
Say something!

666
00:36:54,952 --> 00:36:57,261
What else could I have done? Hadn't I done that,

667
00:36:57,262 --> 00:37:00,061
my husband might've divorced me!

668
00:37:00,062 --> 00:37:01,862
That's why you pinned it all on me?

669
00:37:01,863 --> 00:37:03,304
You're here to argue with me about this?

670
00:37:03,392 --> 00:37:05,931
You petty-minded jerk.

671
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,632
What? "Petty-minded"? What is wrong with this old lady?

672
00:37:08,633 --> 00:37:11,541
"Old lady"? If you keep this up, I won't let it slide.

673
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:13,459
What are you going to do, then?

674
00:37:14,673 --> 00:37:15,744
What? Why did you whistle...

675
00:37:17,012 --> 00:37:18,042
Hey, you...

676
00:37:18,082 --> 00:37:19,215
- come here. - Darn it.

677
00:37:19,443 --> 00:37:21,102
- You traitor! - Get him!

678
00:37:25,722 --> 00:37:26,856
Next news.

679
00:37:26,892 --> 00:37:29,121
The Yong Pal Gang, the biggest criminal gang in the country,

680
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:30,605
has been arrested.

681
00:37:30,622 --> 00:37:32,862
The police announced last night that they arrested Kim,

682
00:37:32,863 --> 00:37:35,732
the leader of the Yong Pal Gang,

683
00:37:35,733 --> 00:37:38,061
as well as about 100 members of the gang...

684
00:37:38,062 --> 00:37:39,577
for group assault and extortion.

685
00:37:39,602 --> 00:37:42,572
Gosh, that scumbag. He finally got arrested.

686
00:37:42,573 --> 00:37:44,663
Thank goodness. Woo Shik.

687
00:37:44,773 --> 00:37:46,730
Running away from that jerk must've been so stressful.

688
00:37:47,573 --> 00:37:49,311
Jun Ki, I've been so scared and stressed out.

689
00:37:49,312 --> 00:37:51,919
Of course, I know. I totally understand how you feel.

690
00:37:53,082 --> 00:37:54,185
Let's watch something else.

691
00:37:54,312 --> 00:37:55,351
Next news.

692
00:37:55,352 --> 00:37:56,414
Hello.

693
00:37:59,053 --> 00:38:01,319
That face I saw just now looked so familiar.

694
00:38:02,153 --> 00:38:04,692
- And tear-invoking stories. - What?

695
00:38:04,693 --> 00:38:07,192
- What is that? - We check out fascinating places.

696
00:38:07,193 --> 00:38:09,192
The most popular segment on "Hometown Report".

697
00:38:09,193 --> 00:38:10,366
"My Gosh."

698
00:38:10,932 --> 00:38:14,889
"How Is That Possible". Let's get started.

699
00:38:15,102 --> 00:38:16,772
Shall we shout together?

700
00:38:16,773 --> 00:38:19,142
Let's go! Let's go check it out!

701
00:38:19,273 --> 00:38:20,911
Jun Ki, isn't that you?

702
00:38:20,912 --> 00:38:22,386
What are you talking about? It's not me.

703
00:38:22,512 --> 00:38:24,081
Hey, let's watch something else.

704
00:38:24,082 --> 00:38:25,586
- No, let's keep watching. - Stay still.

705
00:38:27,553 --> 00:38:28,911
- Stay put. - Gosh, I'm going to throw up!

706
00:38:28,912 --> 00:38:30,603
Let go, please!

707
00:38:30,753 --> 00:38:32,915
- No! - Reporter version of Yoo Jae Seok.

708
00:38:33,082 --> 00:38:34,124
I'm Lee Jun Ki.

709
00:38:35,452 --> 00:38:39,621
All right. I came to Jeongeup, North Jeolla Province,

710
00:38:39,622 --> 00:38:41,899
to meet a dog that can supposedly pee while standing up.

711
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:43,166
Gildong!

712
00:38:44,003 --> 00:38:46,165
That's Gildong. Hi, Gildong.

713
00:38:47,003 --> 00:38:48,650
- Okay, here we go! - Gildong!

714
00:38:50,602 --> 00:38:51,673
Gildong!

715
00:38:53,742 --> 00:38:55,009
Look at his neck!

716
00:38:55,472 --> 00:38:56,606
Don't laugh.

717
00:38:57,613 --> 00:38:59,261
- Gildong... - Stop laughing!

718
00:38:59,512 --> 00:39:02,233
Especially you. Don't laugh, you jerk!

719
00:39:02,613 --> 00:39:04,382
You were all depressed even a few minutes ago.

720
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:05,482
Right, I'm sorry.

721
00:39:05,483 --> 00:39:07,379
But what is that? Did you work as a reporter?

722
00:39:07,992 --> 00:39:09,229
I had no choice.

723
00:39:09,492 --> 00:39:11,692
I'm behind on my credit card bills. They'll start harassing me soon.

724
00:39:11,693 --> 00:39:13,522
Hey, still. What's with that costume?

725
00:39:13,523 --> 00:39:15,732
It's just a concept, you fool.

726
00:39:15,733 --> 00:39:18,545
It's hosted by the anchor, Jo Sang Woo, right?

727
00:39:18,602 --> 00:39:19,661
How do you know?

728
00:39:19,662 --> 00:39:21,527
I'm a huge fan of his.

729
00:39:21,602 --> 00:39:24,041
That said, get me his autograph.

730
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:25,134
His autograph?

731
00:39:25,773 --> 00:39:27,595
- Okay, sure. - Nice.

732
00:39:27,872 --> 00:39:30,681
Jun Ki, what's it like to be a reporter? Is it fun?

733
00:39:30,682 --> 00:39:32,681
It's actually more interesting than I thought it'd be.

734
00:39:32,682 --> 00:39:34,411
I get to meet many interesting people...

735
00:39:34,412 --> 00:39:35,690
and eat a lot of good food.

736
00:39:36,182 --> 00:39:37,563
I see.

737
00:39:38,323 --> 00:39:39,559
That sounds fun.

738
00:39:42,992 --> 00:39:47,113
(Dear My Friends)

739
00:39:48,033 --> 00:39:49,886
- Do I look like a mantis? - Gosh, stop it.

740
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:53,802
By the way, what's going on?

741
00:39:53,803 --> 00:39:55,302
Why did you offer to do my makeup here?

742
00:39:55,303 --> 00:39:57,259
What? Just because.

743
00:39:57,673 --> 00:40:00,442
By the way, when will Jo Sang Woo get here?

744
00:40:00,443 --> 00:40:01,473
Sang Woo?

745
00:40:03,273 --> 00:40:05,342
He uses the huge waiting room over there...

746
00:40:05,343 --> 00:40:06,651
and has professional makeup artists...

747
00:40:07,352 --> 00:40:10,351
Hold on. Are you here to see him?

748
00:40:10,352 --> 00:40:11,455
No, I'm not.

749
00:40:11,483 --> 00:40:13,351
Don't lie to my face. You totally are.

750
00:40:13,352 --> 00:40:16,341
- No, I'm not. - I was wondering what was up.

751
00:40:17,423 --> 00:40:18,522
Jun Ki!

752
00:40:18,523 --> 00:40:20,192
Oh, Sang Woo! You're here.

753
00:40:20,193 --> 00:40:21,264
Have some doughnuts.

754
00:40:21,863 --> 00:40:22,991
My fan sent them for me.

755
00:40:22,992 --> 00:40:24,270
My gosh, thank you so much.

756
00:40:27,773 --> 00:40:30,172
Sang Woo, this is my friend.

757
00:40:30,332 --> 00:40:32,502
She's a huge fan of yours.

758
00:40:32,503 --> 00:40:35,212
- I see. - Hey, come and say hello.

759
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:38,582
Hello, I'm Kim Jung Eun.

760
00:40:38,783 --> 00:40:40,328
I see. Nice to meet you.

761
00:40:40,553 --> 00:40:41,686
I'll see you around.

762
00:40:42,182 --> 00:40:43,212
Yes.

763
00:40:43,213 --> 00:40:44,252
Take it easy.

764
00:40:44,452 --> 00:40:46,307
- See you in a bit! - All right.

765
00:40:47,352 --> 00:40:50,621
I'm still so nervous. My heart almost jumped out of my chest.

766
00:40:50,622 --> 00:40:52,889
Goodness. Do you like him that much?

767
00:40:53,222 --> 00:40:55,391
Then why don't you try hitting on him?

768
00:40:55,392 --> 00:40:57,032
Forget it. I can't do that.

769
00:40:57,033 --> 00:40:58,649
Why can't you?

770
00:40:59,503 --> 00:41:00,564
Shall I help you?

771
00:41:01,102 --> 00:41:03,441
- You? - Have you forgotten who I am?

772
00:41:03,602 --> 00:41:05,942
I'm the dating expert, Lee Jun Ki.

773
00:41:05,943 --> 00:41:07,041
If I put my mind to it,

774
00:41:07,042 --> 00:41:10,442
I can make sure Sang Woo and you get married within a week.

775
00:41:10,443 --> 00:41:11,853
- Really? - Yes.

776
00:41:12,383 --> 00:41:15,382
But you'll have to keep doing my makeup for the show.

777
00:41:15,383 --> 00:41:16,855
What do you say? Deal?

778
00:41:18,053 --> 00:41:19,083
Deal!

779
00:41:22,923 --> 00:41:26,161
The business plan for Yu Ri's Kitchen looks pretty good.

780
00:41:26,162 --> 00:41:28,047
(About the Business, Chef Name: Cha Yu Ri, Menu)

781
00:41:28,093 --> 00:41:32,841
The start-up fund is most important. Where will I get the money?

782
00:41:33,403 --> 00:41:34,916
It's stressing me out.

783
00:41:34,932 --> 00:41:36,272
I'm back.

784
00:41:36,932 --> 00:41:38,694
Ki Bong, where were you?

785
00:41:39,472 --> 00:41:42,641
Well, I was feeling a bit heavy after lying down for days.

786
00:41:42,642 --> 00:41:43,772
So I went for a jog.

787
00:41:43,773 --> 00:41:47,285
What happened? You weren't eating and were feeling down for so long.

788
00:41:47,582 --> 00:41:50,158
You said I might have other chocolates left.

789
00:41:50,923 --> 00:41:53,117
So I decided to start over.

790
00:41:53,892 --> 00:41:56,778
I don't know exactly what I'm going to do, though.

791
00:41:57,122 --> 00:41:59,362
Do you need my help?

792
00:41:59,363 --> 00:42:01,763
Are you sure? That'd be great.

793
00:42:03,162 --> 00:42:06,191
You don't really strike me as the studying type.

794
00:42:06,832 --> 00:42:08,831
What about a model? You have a nice body.

795
00:42:08,832 --> 00:42:10,140
- I'm bow-legged. - You are?

796
00:42:10,472 --> 00:42:13,541
- What about a personal trainer? - My shoulders are injured.

797
00:42:13,542 --> 00:42:15,811
- A cook like me? - I can't even make rolled omelets.

798
00:42:15,812 --> 00:42:17,048
Then...

799
00:42:18,812 --> 00:42:21,564
- An astronaut? - An astronaut?

800
00:42:23,153 --> 00:42:24,564
That sounds fun.

801
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:26,252
But I can't stand wearing a helmet.

802
00:42:26,253 --> 00:42:28,522
Gosh. Is there anything you can do well?

803
00:42:28,523 --> 00:42:30,305
How can you be good at nothing?

804
00:42:30,762 --> 00:42:31,896
I know.

805
00:42:32,423 --> 00:42:34,833
Baseball was the only thing I could do well.

806
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:37,462
I'm totally hopeless.

807
00:42:37,463 --> 00:42:38,946
No.

808
00:42:39,633 --> 00:42:41,353
I was just joking.

809
00:42:41,503 --> 00:42:42,708
Let's keep thinking.

810
00:42:43,472 --> 00:42:44,606
Well...

811
00:42:45,372 --> 00:42:48,471
Were you good at anything before you started playing baseball?

812
00:42:48,472 --> 00:42:49,709
Was I good at anything?

813
00:42:49,843 --> 00:42:53,041
In elementary school, my poems won a prize.

814
00:42:53,042 --> 00:42:54,252
- What? Poems? - Yes.

815
00:42:54,253 --> 00:42:56,035
- You wrote poems? - I did.

816
00:42:56,153 --> 00:42:58,681
Before baseball, my dream was to be a poet.

817
00:42:58,682 --> 00:42:59,816
Really?

818
00:43:01,053 --> 00:43:02,464
A poet sure sounds nice.

819
00:43:02,653 --> 00:43:04,208
Then try writing poems.

820
00:43:04,523 --> 00:43:05,799
Poems?

821
00:43:10,262 --> 00:43:11,302
Come.

822
00:43:11,303 --> 00:43:12,878
- Welcome. - Hi.

823
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:15,371
What is this? Why did you bring me to a gym?

824
00:43:15,372 --> 00:43:17,403
I did a little digging on Sang Woo,

825
00:43:17,542 --> 00:43:19,912
and this is where he works out every evening.

826
00:43:20,042 --> 00:43:22,112
So go sign up right now.

827
00:43:22,113 --> 00:43:23,241
Me? Why?

828
00:43:23,242 --> 00:43:24,550
What do you think?

829
00:43:24,983 --> 00:43:27,559
Repeated coincidences can turn into something meaningful.

830
00:43:27,682 --> 00:43:28,712
Think about it.

831
00:43:28,713 --> 00:43:31,482
After seeing you in the dressing room, he runs into you...

832
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,759
here at the gym again.

833
00:43:32,952 --> 00:43:34,260
What would he think?

834
00:43:34,423 --> 00:43:36,351
"Oh, my. I can't believe this."

835
00:43:36,352 --> 00:43:38,320
"How interesting." Wouldn't he think that?

836
00:43:38,923 --> 00:43:40,715
- I'm not sure. - "I'm not sure"?

837
00:43:40,832 --> 00:43:43,462
Anyway, if he keeps running into you like that,

838
00:43:43,463 --> 00:43:44,636
someday he will think...

839
00:43:46,102 --> 00:43:48,028
"Could she be the one for me?"

840
00:43:48,673 --> 00:43:49,806
"Could she be my destiny?"

841
00:43:50,303 --> 00:43:52,198
He'll start thinking about you.

842
00:43:52,273 --> 00:43:55,072
And then before you realize, you two will be dating,

843
00:43:55,073 --> 00:43:56,442
getting rings, getting engaged,

844
00:43:56,443 --> 00:43:59,120
getting married, having kids, and sending the kids to school.

845
00:43:59,182 --> 00:44:00,831
- Do you think so? - Yes.

846
00:44:01,053 --> 00:44:02,581
Isn't this gym pretty expensive?

847
00:44:02,582 --> 00:44:03,715
Is that what you're worried about?

848
00:44:03,852 --> 00:44:05,552
I thought you wanted to be Sang Woo's girlfriend.

849
00:44:05,553 --> 00:44:07,022
Fine, forget it.

850
00:44:07,023 --> 00:44:08,877
Wait. I'll do it.

851
00:44:12,792 --> 00:44:14,615
How can a gym be so expensive?

852
00:44:15,533 --> 00:44:17,078
It's as expensive as my monthly living expenses.

853
00:44:18,702 --> 00:44:21,485
Anyway, where is Sang Woo?

854
00:44:22,602 --> 00:44:23,735
There he is.

855
00:44:28,613 --> 00:44:31,084
Oh, aren't you Mr. Jo Sang Woo?

856
00:44:31,843 --> 00:44:34,911
Yes, I am. Who are you?

857
00:44:34,912 --> 00:44:37,704
We met at the broadcasting station. I'm Jun Ki's friend,

858
00:44:37,923 --> 00:44:39,158
Kim Jung Eun.

859
00:44:40,722 --> 00:44:42,592
Oh, hello.

860
00:44:42,593 --> 00:44:45,291
How can we just randomly run into each other...

861
00:44:45,292 --> 00:44:47,561
twice in a row? Unbelievable.

862
00:44:47,562 --> 00:44:49,550
You work out here?

863
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,268
I've never seen you before.

864
00:44:51,932 --> 00:44:54,199
Well, the thing is...

865
00:44:54,533 --> 00:44:57,971
With spring here, I wanted to start working out.

866
00:44:57,972 --> 00:44:59,589
So I signed up today.

867
00:45:00,542 --> 00:45:02,942
You signed up today? This is my last day.

868
00:45:02,972 --> 00:45:04,663
- What? - Good luck then.

869
00:45:05,443 --> 00:45:06,616
Well...

870
00:45:09,213 --> 00:45:11,078
Gosh, my money.

871
00:45:13,053 --> 00:45:15,922
Die, you idiot! Die!

872
00:45:15,923 --> 00:45:17,056
Stop it!

873
00:45:17,323 --> 00:45:19,351
- I had no idea. - Be quiet!

874
00:45:19,392 --> 00:45:20,422
What about my money?

875
00:45:20,423 --> 00:45:22,462
I can't even get a refund. What are you going to do?

876
00:45:22,463 --> 00:45:24,402
Hey, that's enough.

877
00:45:24,403 --> 00:45:26,979
See? She wants you to stop. I've had enough.

878
00:45:27,372 --> 00:45:29,804
- That's not going to do anything. - What?

879
00:45:33,943 --> 00:45:36,411
This will take care of it at once.

880
00:45:36,412 --> 00:45:37,545
What?

881
00:45:39,742 --> 00:45:41,311
- Jun Ki! - My goodness.

882
00:45:41,312 --> 00:45:43,929
When will they grow up?

883
00:45:44,122 --> 00:45:45,255
I know.

884
00:45:47,722 --> 00:45:48,886
What's this?

885
00:45:50,492 --> 00:45:52,893
Is this Jun Ki's reporter script?

886
00:45:55,292 --> 00:45:57,250
So this is what a script looks like.

887
00:46:04,702 --> 00:46:05,772
Okay.

888
00:46:05,773 --> 00:46:07,874
Please let me know if there's any gig.

889
00:46:08,312 --> 00:46:09,579
Bye.

890
00:46:10,983 --> 00:46:13,581
You want another gig after what you went through?

891
00:46:13,582 --> 00:46:14,951
I need some money.

892
00:46:14,952 --> 00:46:17,116
So suddenly? What for?

893
00:46:19,153 --> 00:46:20,317
Nothing.

894
00:46:20,722 --> 00:46:23,165
Yu Ri!

895
00:46:23,352 --> 00:46:25,161
What is it now?

896
00:46:25,162 --> 00:46:27,791
Well, I wrote a poem.

897
00:46:27,792 --> 00:46:28,931
Do you want to hear?

898
00:46:28,932 --> 00:46:30,732
A poem? What is this all about?

899
00:46:30,733 --> 00:46:34,002
The thing is, Ki Bong wants to become a poet.

900
00:46:34,003 --> 00:46:37,299
- You write poems? - Yes. Do you want to hear?

901
00:46:37,602 --> 00:46:39,971
But it's been a long time.

902
00:46:39,972 --> 00:46:41,209
Please don't laugh at me.

903
00:46:41,343 --> 00:46:42,547
We won't.

904
00:46:47,812 --> 00:46:50,017
The title is "Like It?"

905
00:46:51,122 --> 00:46:53,729
"By Kook Ki Bong."

906
00:46:55,193 --> 00:46:56,738
"Are you okay now?"

907
00:46:57,593 --> 00:46:59,168
"It was too hard..."

908
00:46:59,863 --> 00:47:02,160
"to end it."

909
00:47:03,332 --> 00:47:05,806
"It was just a breakup."

910
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:09,618
"Yet we had such a hard time."

911
00:47:10,733 --> 00:47:12,342
Let me explain this part briefly.

912
00:47:12,343 --> 00:47:14,342
I quit baseball because I got injured, right?

913
00:47:14,343 --> 00:47:17,463
I'm comparing it to a breakup here.

914
00:47:18,483 --> 00:47:19,987
That's pretty good.

915
00:47:20,042 --> 00:47:22,042
- Go on. - Okay.

916
00:47:25,483 --> 00:47:29,305
"From time to time, I hear you're doing well."

917
00:47:30,023 --> 00:47:33,731
"You're already seeing a good man,"

918
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,510
"and you're fine."

919
00:47:36,633 --> 00:47:39,384
"I didn't ask, but I was told anyway."

920
00:47:40,932 --> 00:47:42,889
Here I'm talking to my baseball equipment.

921
00:47:43,003 --> 00:47:45,784
I left it at the training ground, and apparently it's doing fine.

922
00:47:45,903 --> 00:47:48,371
But the thing is, the coach gave it to another player...

923
00:47:48,372 --> 00:47:51,062
and somehow felt the need to tell me. That's what it's about.

924
00:47:51,312 --> 00:47:54,094
I see. That must have hurt.

925
00:47:55,383 --> 00:47:57,897
Actually, while writing this part yesterday,

926
00:47:57,923 --> 00:48:01,354
I started missing my equipment so badly. My heart just...

927
00:48:03,892 --> 00:48:06,468
Sorry. I'm doing this again.

928
00:48:08,332 --> 00:48:09,877
Let me go wash my face.

929
00:48:12,903 --> 00:48:14,623
He's big,

930
00:48:14,932 --> 00:48:17,772
but he can be quite emotional, right?

931
00:48:17,773 --> 00:48:20,371
Look. Didn't that sound way too familiar?

932
00:48:20,372 --> 00:48:21,577
- What? - I think so too.

933
00:48:22,012 --> 00:48:23,146
Wait.

934
00:48:23,613 --> 00:48:26,013
Isn't that song lyrics?

935
00:48:26,642 --> 00:48:29,229
I think it's pretty similar to "Like It?" by Yoon Jong Shin.

936
00:48:29,983 --> 00:48:31,291
That's right.

937
00:48:31,452 --> 00:48:33,544
Are you okay now?

938
00:48:33,622 --> 00:48:35,621
It was too hard...

939
00:48:35,622 --> 00:48:39,166
to end it

940
00:48:39,392 --> 00:48:40,597
It's exactly the same.

941
00:48:40,863 --> 00:48:43,732
What's going on here? Doesn't he realize his poem...

942
00:48:43,733 --> 00:48:45,761
- is just like the lyrics? - Apparently not.

943
00:48:45,963 --> 00:48:48,270
I knew it. It was just too good.

944
00:48:48,673 --> 00:48:51,764
Guys, don't say anything to him.

945
00:48:52,073 --> 00:48:54,752
He's finally trying to do something new.

946
00:48:54,912 --> 00:48:56,623
Let's not disappoint him.

947
00:48:56,713 --> 00:48:58,433
- Okay? - Fine.

948
00:48:58,613 --> 00:48:59,714
Okay.

949
00:49:02,076 --> 00:49:03,975
Jung Eun! Where are you?

950
00:49:03,976 --> 00:49:06,036
Jung Eun! There you are. Jung Eun!

951
00:49:06,416 --> 00:49:08,386
Big news!

952
00:49:08,387 --> 00:49:11,169
- Big news? - I did some more digging...

953
00:49:11,217 --> 00:49:13,156
and found out Sang Woo is active in a club these days.

954
00:49:13,157 --> 00:49:17,071
Guess what? They have a regular gathering today.

955
00:49:17,257 --> 00:49:19,596
- So what? - What do you mean, "so what"?

956
00:49:19,657 --> 00:49:21,895
You'll join that club and make coincidences happen.

957
00:49:21,896 --> 00:49:23,566
Is it that coincidence nonsense again?

958
00:49:23,567 --> 00:49:26,066
Let me tell you something about coincidences.

959
00:49:26,067 --> 00:49:29,641
There have to be at least three of them for it to have any meaning.

960
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:33,236
It might sound silly, but it has worked every time.

961
00:49:33,237 --> 00:49:34,442
What kind of club is it anyway?

962
00:49:44,437 --> 00:49:45,775
Your name is Jung Eun?

963
00:49:47,207 --> 00:49:50,976
I never expected a woman would join our alphorn club.

964
00:49:50,977 --> 00:49:54,932
Have you always been interested in the Swiss alphorn?

965
00:49:55,776 --> 00:49:57,528
That's incredible.

966
00:49:57,716 --> 00:50:00,602
Most people have never even seen it.

967
00:50:03,816 --> 00:50:06,505
Gosh, where is Sang Woo?

968
00:50:06,727 --> 00:50:08,755
What's going on?

969
00:50:10,796 --> 00:50:13,032
I'm sorry I'm late.

970
00:50:13,367 --> 00:50:16,355
Oh, my. Sang Woo, we meet again.

971
00:50:16,566 --> 00:50:17,741
Unbelievable.

972
00:50:18,037 --> 00:50:20,436
I've been in this club for a while now.

973
00:50:20,437 --> 00:50:23,536
- You know each other? - Well, a little.

974
00:50:23,537 --> 00:50:26,122
I see.

975
00:50:26,307 --> 00:50:29,026
Then you could teach her.

976
00:50:29,577 --> 00:50:30,987
I guess.

977
00:50:31,046 --> 00:50:33,003
That'd be great.

978
00:50:36,017 --> 00:50:37,855
Yu Ri.

979
00:50:37,856 --> 00:50:38,958
Woo Shik.

980
00:50:39,026 --> 00:50:41,809
I wrote another poem. Do you guys want to hear it?

981
00:50:42,396 --> 00:50:44,996
A poem? You wrote another poem?

982
00:50:44,997 --> 00:50:46,027
Yes.

983
00:50:46,396 --> 00:50:49,996
Ideas keep popping up inside my head, and I can't stay still.

984
00:50:49,997 --> 00:50:52,735
Is that so? Why don't you read it out then?

985
00:50:52,736 --> 00:50:53,798
Okay.

986
00:50:54,267 --> 00:50:57,264
Before that, let me explain briefly about this poem.

987
00:50:57,537 --> 00:51:01,815
Since I'm a beast who has been hurt by baseball,

988
00:51:01,816 --> 00:51:05,454
it's a message that warns you not to mess with me anymore.

989
00:51:05,917 --> 00:51:07,018
I'll read it then.

990
00:51:10,617 --> 00:51:12,172
The title is "Growl".

991
00:51:13,057 --> 00:51:15,293
"By Kook Ki Bong."

992
00:51:15,896 --> 00:51:17,927
"Yo. Okay."

993
00:51:20,097 --> 00:51:23,835
"I'm warning you right now, so listen carefully."

994
00:51:23,836 --> 00:51:26,605
"I'm so dangerous right now. So dangerous."

995
00:51:26,606 --> 00:51:29,335
"Stop provoking me. You'll be in big trouble."

996
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,985
"Even I don't know myself."

997
00:51:34,546 --> 00:51:38,255
"I'm starting to turn violent bit by bit."

998
00:51:39,086 --> 00:51:43,315
"I'm starting to growl, growl, and growl."

999
00:51:43,316 --> 00:51:47,273
"I'm starting to growl, growl, and growl."

1000
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,624
"If you don't back off,"

1001
00:51:51,026 --> 00:51:52,644
"you might get hurt."

1002
00:51:56,437 --> 00:51:57,600
What do you think?

1003
00:51:57,767 --> 00:52:00,406
It's nice. It has a cool vibe about it.

1004
00:52:00,407 --> 00:52:01,437
I know, right?

1005
00:52:02,236 --> 00:52:04,105
I think I'm really talented in writing poems.

1006
00:52:04,106 --> 00:52:06,476
It doesn't even take 30 minutes to finish writing one.

1007
00:52:08,077 --> 00:52:09,282
I've thought of another one.

1008
00:52:09,946 --> 00:52:11,152
I'll go write my next poem.

1009
00:52:13,586 --> 00:52:16,255
Brother, didn't that one sound okay?

1010
00:52:16,256 --> 00:52:17,416
How could that be okay?

1011
00:52:17,417 --> 00:52:19,085
That's the same as EXO's "Growl".

1012
00:52:19,086 --> 00:52:21,025
He just changed the lyrics a little.

1013
00:52:21,026 --> 00:52:22,191
No wonder.

1014
00:52:22,356 --> 00:52:24,666
I was almost singing along with him.

1015
00:52:24,667 --> 00:52:26,295
Are you going to keep leaving him like that?

1016
00:52:26,296 --> 00:52:29,460
Then what? He's trying so hard.

1017
00:52:29,796 --> 00:52:33,825
At least he's not wasting money. Just act like you like it.

1018
00:52:38,946 --> 00:52:39,976
This is so hard.

1019
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,169
I told you that you're doing it wrong.

1020
00:52:42,316 --> 00:52:43,686
This is so frustrating.

1021
00:52:43,876 --> 00:52:44,918
I'm sorry.

1022
00:52:45,446 --> 00:52:48,016
Darn, what am I doing here?

1023
00:52:48,017 --> 00:52:50,459
Sang Woo just keeps getting angry at me.

1024
00:52:51,017 --> 00:52:52,956
Why is this thing so hard to blow?

1025
00:52:52,957 --> 00:52:55,556
All right. Why don't we try it again?

1026
00:52:55,557 --> 00:52:57,996
Jung Eun, gather all your energy in your stomach...

1027
00:52:57,997 --> 00:53:00,365
and blow like you're blowing all the energy out of your body.

1028
00:53:00,497 --> 00:53:01,938
Try blowing like this.

1029
00:53:03,637 --> 00:53:05,665
Good, okay? Let's go.

1030
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:10,507
Blow harder.

1031
00:53:11,407 --> 00:53:12,477
You're almost there.

1032
00:53:12,546 --> 00:53:13,916
A little harder.

1033
00:53:35,867 --> 00:53:38,793
How could I be humiliated in front of Sang Woo like this?

1034
00:53:39,637 --> 00:53:42,253
Who knew I'd fart in that situation?

1035
00:53:46,347 --> 00:53:47,407
What are you doing here?

1036
00:53:48,816 --> 00:53:50,012
Nothing much.

1037
00:53:55,586 --> 00:53:56,853
Why do you look so down?

1038
00:53:57,687 --> 00:53:59,953
Is it because of what happened earlier?

1039
00:54:00,157 --> 00:54:01,907
Don't worry about it.

1040
00:54:02,157 --> 00:54:05,166
I farted all the time when I first learned.

1041
00:54:05,167 --> 00:54:07,596
And your fart sounded really cute.

1042
00:54:07,597 --> 00:54:10,729
Stop it. I just want to crawl in a hole and die.

1043
00:54:10,736 --> 00:54:11,973
I'm sorry.

1044
00:54:12,307 --> 00:54:14,223
I was just trying to comfort you.

1045
00:54:14,907 --> 00:54:18,141
Jung Eun, don't you think there is a special connection between us?

1046
00:54:18,977 --> 00:54:20,846
What? What do you mean?

1047
00:54:20,847 --> 00:54:23,145
We ran into each other at the broadcasting station,

1048
00:54:23,146 --> 00:54:24,837
the fitness center,

1049
00:54:24,847 --> 00:54:26,715
and even at the alphorn club.

1050
00:54:26,716 --> 00:54:28,674
We bumped into each other three times.

1051
00:54:29,117 --> 00:54:30,425
Doesn't it feel strange?

1052
00:54:31,187 --> 00:54:33,040
If you have time tomorrow,

1053
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:35,732
shall we go for a drive?

1054
00:54:35,796 --> 00:54:36,826
Sorry?

1055
00:54:37,497 --> 00:54:38,732
Where did you get this sausage?

1056
00:54:38,896 --> 00:54:40,060
- Is it good? - Yes.

1057
00:54:43,767 --> 00:54:45,036
Where is Ki Bong?

1058
00:54:45,037 --> 00:54:47,366
He's writing poems again.

1059
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:50,335
He fidgeted all night writing, and I couldn't get any sleep.

1060
00:54:50,336 --> 00:54:53,206
He was even searching about poetry contests on the Internet.

1061
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:55,016
What? Poetry contests?

1062
00:54:55,017 --> 00:54:56,387
Yes, I'm telling you.

1063
00:54:56,417 --> 00:54:59,022
Yu Ri, why don't you just be honest with him now?

1064
00:54:59,617 --> 00:55:02,156
I want to, but I'm afraid he might get disappointed.

1065
00:55:02,157 --> 00:55:04,556
No, he'll be more disappointed if you tell him later.

1066
00:55:05,986 --> 00:55:08,395
Okay. I'll have a talk with him later.

1067
00:55:08,396 --> 00:55:09,426
You should.

1068
00:55:09,526 --> 00:55:10,896
Guys!

1069
00:55:13,327 --> 00:55:15,634
Ta-da! How do I look?

1070
00:55:16,296 --> 00:55:18,806
Gosh, is today the day you dress up as a girl?

1071
00:55:18,807 --> 00:55:20,516
What? Do you have a death wish?

1072
00:55:20,736 --> 00:55:22,973
Jung Eun, where are you going so dressed up?

1073
00:55:24,176 --> 00:55:26,752
I have a date with Sang Woo today.

1074
00:55:28,946 --> 00:55:30,286
Are you that happy?

1075
00:55:30,477 --> 00:55:32,887
You know this is all because of me, right?

1076
00:55:33,617 --> 00:55:35,585
Yes, it's all thanks to you.

1077
00:55:35,586 --> 00:55:36,926
Stop being so arrogant.

1078
00:55:37,157 --> 00:55:38,726
What's that huge smoking pipe for?

1079
00:55:38,727 --> 00:55:40,386
Hey, this isn't a smoking pipe.

1080
00:55:40,387 --> 00:55:42,855
It's an alphorn. It's a traditional instrument from Switzerland.

1081
00:55:42,856 --> 00:55:44,576
Oh, so that was an instrument.

1082
00:55:44,597 --> 00:55:46,759
No wonder. It was too long for a smoking pipe.

1083
00:55:47,126 --> 00:55:48,895
Where are you going on your date?

1084
00:55:48,896 --> 00:55:50,996
We're going to his villa in Gapyeong.

1085
00:55:50,997 --> 00:55:52,965
Gapyeong? A villa?

1086
00:55:53,106 --> 00:55:55,786
You just met, and you're already going on a trip? No!

1087
00:55:55,907 --> 00:55:58,111
It's not a trip. We're coming back today.

1088
00:55:58,606 --> 00:56:01,375
Wait. Whether I go on a trip or not,

1089
00:56:01,376 --> 00:56:03,076
who are you to say no?

1090
00:56:03,077 --> 00:56:05,766
Me? I'm your best friend.

1091
00:56:05,847 --> 00:56:07,949
Of course I want to let you go,

1092
00:56:08,157 --> 00:56:09,355
but what should I say...

1093
00:56:09,356 --> 00:56:12,025
You're like a little child out there alone in this harsh world.

1094
00:56:12,026 --> 00:56:13,656
Worry about yourself.

1095
00:56:13,657 --> 00:56:15,511
- What? - See you guys.

1096
00:56:17,126 --> 00:56:19,895
- Bye. - Hey, what about my shoot?

1097
00:56:19,896 --> 00:56:21,956
What about my makeup? Hey, hey!

1098
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:26,516
I knew it. This is why they say you shouldn't be so generous.

1099
00:56:26,807 --> 00:56:28,589
Jun Ki, shall I go instead?

1100
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:30,576
It's my day off today.

1101
00:56:30,577 --> 00:56:32,476
I want to go look at the set too.

1102
00:56:32,477 --> 00:56:34,948
Really? I'll be grateful.

1103
00:56:37,676 --> 00:56:39,541
Ki Bong, do you have time to talk...

1104
00:56:41,887 --> 00:56:42,948
Is he sleeping?

1105
00:56:47,526 --> 00:56:49,515
I guess he fell asleep writing another poem.

1106
00:56:50,426 --> 00:56:51,911
What was he writing this time?

1107
00:56:57,396 --> 00:56:58,643
"Stylish Like Gangnam"?

1108
00:56:59,307 --> 00:57:02,058
"A girl who is warm and friendly during the day."

1109
00:57:02,236 --> 00:57:05,105
"A classy girl who knows how to enjoy a cup of coffee."

1110
00:57:05,106 --> 00:57:08,105
"A girl with that type of twist."

1111
00:57:09,876 --> 00:57:11,535
"Oppa is stylish like Gangnam?"

1112
00:57:11,546 --> 00:57:12,576
Unbelievable.

1113
00:57:13,816 --> 00:57:16,022
It's PSY's "Gangnam Style" this time.

1114
00:57:16,356 --> 00:57:18,902
I almost did the horse dance too.

1115
00:57:20,926 --> 00:57:22,029
Is there another one?

1116
00:57:24,196 --> 00:57:25,669
"Sorry, Mom Rhapsody"?

1117
00:57:27,296 --> 00:57:30,284
It's obvious he plagiarized "Bohemian Rhapsody".

1118
00:57:30,497 --> 00:57:33,454
He's even messing with Queen's song now?

1119
00:57:37,006 --> 00:57:38,036
Oh, gosh.

1120
00:57:38,276 --> 00:57:41,246
Sorry, Mom, sorry Mom, sorry Mom, rhapsody

1121
00:57:41,247 --> 00:57:44,956
I'm sorry, Mom, I'm sorry, Mom

1122
00:57:45,847 --> 00:57:48,464
He even copied the rhythm.

1123
00:57:52,557 --> 00:57:54,525
He even saw the live performance.

1124
00:57:54,526 --> 00:57:57,236
- He saw it. - All right!

1125
00:57:58,696 --> 00:58:00,859
What should I do about you?

1126
00:58:01,537 --> 00:58:02,629
(50-year-old Kalguksu Restaurant)

1127
00:58:08,977 --> 00:58:11,067
So this is what a set looks like.

1128
00:58:11,137 --> 00:58:12,207
It's amazing.

1129
00:58:12,506 --> 00:58:13,887
There's nothing to be amazed about.

1130
00:58:14,946 --> 00:58:16,904
Shall I practice my lines?

1131
00:58:17,876 --> 00:58:20,145
Hello. The place I want to introduce today is...

1132
00:58:20,146 --> 00:58:23,248
a famous kalguksu restaurant located in Boryeong, Chungnam...

1133
00:58:25,756 --> 00:58:26,818
Why does my throat hurt so much?

1134
00:58:27,227 --> 00:58:28,328
Really?

1135
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:30,596
I'll go get some water. Hold on.

1136
00:58:30,597 --> 00:58:31,729
- Water? - Yes.

1137
00:58:32,667 --> 00:58:35,138
Thanks, Soo Yeon. She's so nice.

1138
00:58:35,236 --> 00:58:37,225
- Jun Ki. - Hello, sir.

1139
00:58:37,537 --> 00:58:39,366
Wow, who is she?

1140
00:58:39,367 --> 00:58:40,809
I like her looks.

1141
00:58:40,867 --> 00:58:42,976
- Is she an actress? - No, she's just a friend.

1142
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,069
Really?

1143
00:58:44,137 --> 00:58:46,681
Why did she come instead of Jung Eun today?

1144
00:58:47,577 --> 00:58:51,563
Actually, Jung Eun and Sang Woo are really hitting it off right now.

1145
00:58:52,086 --> 00:58:53,323
They're on a date.

1146
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:54,579
Is that so?

1147
00:58:54,856 --> 00:58:58,112
But I think she should watch out for Sang Woo.

1148
00:58:58,256 --> 00:59:00,585
I've heard some nasty rumors about him.

1149
00:59:00,586 --> 00:59:02,895
He takes girls to his vacation villa...

1150
00:59:02,896 --> 00:59:04,625
and ghosts them after having fun with them just once.

1151
00:59:04,626 --> 00:59:06,686
We're going to his villa in Gapyeong.

1152
00:59:08,097 --> 00:59:09,127
What?

1153
00:59:09,167 --> 00:59:11,990
He just has fun with them? What do you mean?

1154
00:59:12,607 --> 00:59:14,945
Why isn't she answering her phone?

1155
00:59:15,336 --> 00:59:17,572
What is going on right now?

1156
00:59:18,446 --> 00:59:20,920
Darn, this is driving me nuts.

1157
00:59:20,977 --> 00:59:22,346
Please leave a message...

1158
00:59:22,347 --> 00:59:25,066
Darn it, Jung Eun!

1159
00:59:25,387 --> 00:59:27,344
Jun Ki! Where are you going?

1160
00:59:27,617 --> 00:59:28,925
Where are you going?

1161
00:59:29,952 --> 00:59:32,012
I need to tell Ki Bong.

1162
00:59:32,251 --> 00:59:34,415
But I don't want to disappoint him.

1163
00:59:34,852 --> 00:59:36,397
This is so frustrating.

1164
00:59:38,122 --> 00:59:41,635
Oh. Hey, Ki Bong. What are you doing there?

1165
00:59:41,892 --> 00:59:45,157
Yu Ri, what is this song?

1166
00:59:45,162 --> 00:59:47,325
Song? What song?

1167
00:59:54,541 --> 00:59:55,540
(And you're fine)

1168
00:59:55,541 --> 00:59:56,778
(I didn't ask, but I was told anyway)

1169
00:59:58,311 --> 00:59:59,548
Ki Bong.

1170
01:00:00,642 --> 01:00:02,507
You heard this song?

1171
01:00:02,711 --> 01:00:05,977
Yes. But this song...

1172
01:00:10,521 --> 01:00:11,861
It's such a great song.

1173
01:00:13,162 --> 01:00:14,500
- What's the title? - What?

1174
01:00:15,592 --> 01:00:17,239
"Like It" by Yoon Jong Shin.

1175
01:00:17,461 --> 01:00:19,770
I see, "Like It".

1176
01:00:19,932 --> 01:00:22,549
I've never heard this song before, but it's really nice.

1177
01:00:23,932 --> 01:00:28,197
But I have to say, the lyrics remind me a lot of my poem.

1178
01:00:28,811 --> 01:00:30,007
It's pretty cool.

1179
01:00:31,111 --> 01:00:32,214
What?

1180
01:00:33,142 --> 01:00:37,304
So this is the first time you're hearing this song?

1181
01:00:37,651 --> 01:00:39,520
Yes. I've been preoccupied with baseball,

1182
01:00:39,521 --> 01:00:40,861
so I've never been interested in music.

1183
01:00:40,952 --> 01:00:45,217
Then what about "Growl" by EXO and "Gangnam Style" by PSY?

1184
01:00:45,461 --> 01:00:48,315
Also, what about "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen?

1185
01:00:48,392 --> 01:00:49,463
What are they?

1186
01:00:49,932 --> 01:00:52,300
I've never heard of them before. Why do you ask?

1187
01:00:52,901 --> 01:00:56,435
What? Well, never mind. It's nothing.

1188
01:00:58,702 --> 01:01:00,730
Anyway, this is such a great song.

1189
01:01:01,171 --> 01:01:02,861
I should download the song right away.

1190
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:08,689
What does that mean? So Ki Bong...

1191
01:01:09,352 --> 01:01:11,237
actually wrote those poems?

1192
01:01:17,651 --> 01:01:18,825
Hey, Jun Ki.

1193
01:01:22,291 --> 01:01:23,960
Where did Jun Ki go?

1194
01:01:23,961 --> 01:01:25,816
We don't know. He just took off.

1195
01:01:26,202 --> 01:01:28,830
Pardon? What do you mean?

1196
01:01:28,831 --> 01:01:31,170
The show will air in two days, so we must complete the shoot today.

1197
01:01:31,171 --> 01:01:33,160
Where are we going to find a reporter...

1198
01:01:34,642 --> 01:01:37,010
Excuse me. You said you're Jun Ki's friend, right?

1199
01:01:37,072 --> 01:01:39,966
Oh, yes. Why do you ask?

1200
01:01:41,711 --> 01:01:44,462
Hello, everyone. I'm your reporter, Han Soo Yeon.

1201
01:01:44,651 --> 01:01:47,154
The most popular segment on "Hometown Report",

1202
01:01:47,182 --> 01:01:51,190
"My Gosh, How Is That Possible".

1203
01:01:51,191 --> 01:01:52,294
Let's get started.

1204
01:01:53,892 --> 01:01:55,031
Let's go!

1205
01:01:55,032 --> 01:01:56,948
Cut! Okay, that was great.

1206
01:01:57,162 --> 01:01:59,676
- You're good. - You're very good.

1207
01:01:59,702 --> 01:02:00,896
She's better than Jun Ki.

1208
01:02:07,842 --> 01:02:10,004
I sang at cafes all day long,

1209
01:02:12,981 --> 01:02:14,660
but I only made 30 dollars today.

1210
01:02:16,852 --> 01:02:19,706
When will I save up enough for the course Soo Yeon has to take?

1211
01:02:21,481 --> 01:02:23,583
Oh, Soo Yeon!

1212
01:02:25,662 --> 01:02:27,752
Woo Shik, where are you coming from?

1213
01:02:28,092 --> 01:02:30,873
What? Oh, I had to take care of something.

1214
01:02:31,532 --> 01:02:32,900
Where's Jun Ki? Why are you alone?

1215
01:02:32,901 --> 01:02:35,755
I don't even know. He took off, saying he can't shoot today.

1216
01:02:35,901 --> 01:02:37,601
Everyone was so stressed out because of him.

1217
01:02:37,602 --> 01:02:39,353
Really? Did he get himself in trouble again?

1218
01:02:39,742 --> 01:02:40,875
Who knows.

1219
01:02:41,102 --> 01:02:43,512
Anyway, I had to fill in for him as a reporter today.

1220
01:02:43,771 --> 01:02:46,810
- Really? - The director almost begged me,

1221
01:02:46,811 --> 01:02:48,119
so I couldn't say no.

1222
01:02:48,611 --> 01:02:51,260
But the scriptwriter said I did a great job.

1223
01:02:51,412 --> 01:02:53,480
She also said she'd help me get other gigs as a reporter.

1224
01:02:53,481 --> 01:02:55,995
- Seriously? - Yes, it was actually pretty fun.

1225
01:02:57,092 --> 01:03:00,006
So I'm thinking of giving it a shot.

1226
01:03:00,061 --> 01:03:02,225
Really? Hang on.

1227
01:03:02,932 --> 01:03:04,436
Then you no longer need to take the course?

1228
01:03:04,992 --> 01:03:06,784
It means I no longer have to sing at events.

1229
01:03:07,432 --> 01:03:08,977
What do you mean?

1230
01:03:09,171 --> 01:03:10,541
What course?

1231
01:03:11,532 --> 01:03:12,737
It's nothing.

1232
01:03:13,572 --> 01:03:15,322
Anyway, that's such great news.

1233
01:03:15,441 --> 01:03:17,533
- Best of luck. - Thank you.

1234
01:03:17,912 --> 01:03:20,383
To celebrate this amazing news,

1235
01:03:20,811 --> 01:03:22,399
- how about we go for hotteok? - Hotteok?

1236
01:03:22,481 --> 01:03:23,614
I'd love that!

1237
01:03:23,682 --> 01:03:24,917
Let's go. Let's hurry!

1238
01:03:26,581 --> 01:03:29,229
- You know I want three, right? - All right, sure.

1239
01:03:32,521 --> 01:03:35,067
How about a glass of wine while admiring the beautiful stars?

1240
01:03:35,461 --> 01:03:37,903
You have to drive though. You shouldn't drink.

1241
01:03:38,131 --> 01:03:39,931
Then we'll sleep here and go back tomorrow.

1242
01:03:39,932 --> 01:03:41,033
Pardon?

1243
01:03:44,372 --> 01:03:46,432
Jung Eun. Wait, Jung Eun.

1244
01:03:46,671 --> 01:03:48,710
Jung Eun. Please, Jung Eun.

1245
01:03:48,711 --> 01:03:51,270
- Let go! - How will you get back now?

1246
01:03:51,271 --> 01:03:53,817
I'll figure out a way somehow, so let go of my hand.

1247
01:03:54,081 --> 01:03:55,183
Hey!

1248
01:03:57,251 --> 01:03:59,106
- Let go of her hand! - Jun Ki.

1249
01:04:05,521 --> 01:04:07,344
Jung Eun, are you okay?

1250
01:04:07,662 --> 01:04:10,190
- Nothing happened, right? - Yes.

1251
01:04:10,191 --> 01:04:12,325
Why did you follow him here to begin with? You're too gutsy.

1252
01:04:12,702 --> 01:04:14,400
Why must you worry me like this?

1253
01:04:14,401 --> 01:04:16,493
Hey, Jun Ki. What is this about?

1254
01:04:17,432 --> 01:04:20,430
Look who's talking. What is this about? You're pathetic.

1255
01:04:20,541 --> 01:04:21,634
What?

1256
01:04:22,041 --> 01:04:23,927
Jung Eun, let's go.

1257
01:04:27,081 --> 01:04:30,101
Goodness, I just wanted to have some fun because I was bored.

1258
01:04:30,211 --> 01:04:32,137
Who does she think she is? What a joke.

1259
01:04:43,032 --> 01:04:44,164
I can't let this slide.

1260
01:04:45,302 --> 01:04:47,804
Jung Eun, just a minute, okay?

1261
01:04:54,472 --> 01:04:55,955
- Sang Woo. - What now?

1262
01:04:56,372 --> 01:04:57,917
I have to punch you.

1263
01:05:00,311 --> 01:05:01,373
Are you out of your mind?

1264
01:05:01,541 --> 01:05:03,911
Keep running your mouth if you want to see me actually losing it.

1265
01:05:03,912 --> 01:05:06,043
I guess you want to leave the showbiz industry for good.

1266
01:05:06,151 --> 01:05:09,020
I can get you fired right away, you punk!

1267
01:05:09,021 --> 01:05:10,329
Sure, whatever.

1268
01:05:11,191 --> 01:05:13,695
I won't take those jobs even if they ask me, you jerk.

1269
01:05:22,932 --> 01:05:24,065
Let's go, Jung Eun.

1270
01:05:53,932 --> 01:05:56,476
(Welcome to Waikiki 2 / Eulachacha Waikiki 2)

1271
01:05:57,171 --> 01:05:59,820
This is crazy. I'm smitten by Jun Ki?

1272
01:05:59,941 --> 01:06:01,371
Gosh, I must be losing my mind.

1273
01:06:01,372 --> 01:06:03,141
Have you done something wrong to me?

1274
01:06:03,142 --> 01:06:04,141
I have to write my resume.

1275
01:06:04,142 --> 01:06:05,841
- Can I use your laptop? - Let's see.

1276
01:06:05,842 --> 01:06:07,040
"Never"?

1277
01:06:07,041 --> 01:06:09,451
- What does this mean? - I've never seen the owner.

1278
01:06:09,452 --> 01:06:10,951
That's why I wrote that. Did I get it wrong?

1279
01:06:10,952 --> 01:06:12,621
Reporters must have good diction.

1280
01:06:12,622 --> 01:06:14,321
He said he can't work with me because I don't even have...

1281
01:06:14,322 --> 01:06:15,621
that basic qualification.

1282
01:06:15,622 --> 01:06:17,591
Jun Ki, do you know any reporters?

1283
01:06:17,592 --> 01:06:19,723
- I do know one personally. - Hello.

1284
01:06:19,791 --> 01:06:22,261
Gosh, she keeps spraying out her saliva on my face.

1285
01:06:22,262 --> 01:06:25,177
I can't complain because she's training me for free.

1286
01:06:26,062 --> 01:06:27,163
"Too".
