1
00:00:10,817 --> 00:00:14,152
What? Who did you say you are?

2
00:00:15,657 --> 00:00:16,708
What?

3
00:00:17,327 --> 00:00:18,347
- My gosh! - What?

4
00:00:19,097 --> 00:00:20,995
Hey, what's wrong? Who was it?

5
00:00:20,996 --> 00:00:23,649
My sister is on her way here.

6
00:00:24,697 --> 00:00:25,736
What?

7
00:00:25,737 --> 00:00:27,674
Your sister is on her way here?

8
00:00:27,807 --> 00:00:29,666
Are you serious? Yu Ri is coming here?

9
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:32,635
Yes, she's coming. You guys, go lock the front door.

10
00:00:32,636 --> 00:00:33,860
- Hurry. - Okay.

11
00:00:37,446 --> 00:00:38,497
Hi.

12
00:00:40,046 --> 00:00:41,822
How have you been, you little slacker?

13
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,609
Still slacking off like you used to?

14
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:50,926
Your head has gotten even bigger. How big is it going to get?

15
00:00:50,927 --> 00:00:53,201
It's like a big balloon floating up in the air.

16
00:00:55,796 --> 00:00:57,526
Jung Eun!

17
00:00:57,527 --> 00:00:59,637
It's been so long.

18
00:01:00,236 --> 00:01:02,685
You've become even more manly since I last saw you.

19
00:01:05,937 --> 00:01:07,568
Gosh, you...

20
00:01:10,307 --> 00:01:11,571
I don't know you, do I?

21
00:01:11,676 --> 00:01:12,738
No.

22
00:01:13,247 --> 00:01:15,388
Sorry. Sorry.

23
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:21,235
My cute little brother. How have you been?

24
00:01:22,027 --> 00:01:23,686
Enough of that. Why are you here?

25
00:01:23,687 --> 00:01:25,056
What do you think?

26
00:01:25,057 --> 00:01:27,270
I came to see my brother.

27
00:01:28,426 --> 00:01:30,765
I enjoyed the TV show. The Goatman of Huam-dong.

28
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:32,535
Cut it out! You've seen me, so that's enough.

29
00:01:32,536 --> 00:01:36,688
Leave now. I'm sick and tired of taking care of you.

30
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:38,199
So just leave.

31
00:01:38,406 --> 00:01:39,763
You're so mean.

32
00:01:40,236 --> 00:01:42,318
How could you do this to me?

33
00:01:43,477 --> 00:01:47,016
Do you know what I had to go through to raise you without Mom?

34
00:01:48,717 --> 00:01:50,815
When you came down with a severe cold,

35
00:01:50,816 --> 00:01:52,285
on that cold winter day,

36
00:01:52,286 --> 00:01:55,245
I climbed three mountains with you on my back.

37
00:01:55,687 --> 00:01:57,996
I crossed that ice-cold stream on barefoot...

38
00:01:57,997 --> 00:01:59,425
to take you to the health center. Do you know that?

39
00:01:59,426 --> 00:02:00,925
There were no mountains in our neighborhood.

40
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:03,578
And there was a hospital nearby. Health center, my foot.

41
00:02:04,197 --> 00:02:06,380
Fine. Don't believe me if you don't want to.

42
00:02:07,137 --> 00:02:08,330
I have no choice.

43
00:02:09,307 --> 00:02:10,530
If you want me to go...

44
00:02:11,636 --> 00:02:12,698
I'll go.

45
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:18,491
Take care, everyone.

46
00:02:20,876 --> 00:02:21,967
I'm leaving.

47
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:28,847
Spray salt on the front door.

48
00:02:34,297 --> 00:02:37,285
Woo Shik, I'll go now.

49
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:39,928
Be careful not to catch a cold.

50
00:02:40,696 --> 00:02:42,502
Don't skip your meals.

51
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:44,027
Then...

52
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:45,909
- Goodbye, Woo Shik. - Okay, bye.

53
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,090
Darn it, he didn't fall for it.

54
00:02:56,717 --> 00:02:58,929
He's become smarter since I last saw him.

55
00:02:59,187 --> 00:03:00,379
All right, brother.

56
00:03:01,427 --> 00:03:04,384
Is this how you're going to be? Okay.

57
00:03:05,696 --> 00:03:07,124
Let's see who wins.

58
00:03:08,267 --> 00:03:16,059
(I Saw the Devil)

59
00:03:18,006 --> 00:03:19,772
- Did she leave? - Yes.

60
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:22,505
Still, weren't you a bit too harsh on your sister?

61
00:03:22,506 --> 00:03:24,036
She was even crying.

62
00:03:24,476 --> 00:03:26,315
That was just an act.

63
00:03:26,316 --> 00:03:29,142
Practically, everything that comes out of her mouth is a lie.

64
00:03:29,487 --> 00:03:31,686
Do you know how many times I was fooled by her?

65
00:03:31,687 --> 00:03:34,556
Right. Remember how much she tormented us when we were kids?

66
00:03:34,557 --> 00:03:37,086
I know. Just thinking about it gives me chills.

67
00:03:37,087 --> 00:03:39,456
They're right. No good will come from being around her.

68
00:03:39,457 --> 00:03:41,796
Anyway, guys, this is an emergency situation.

69
00:03:41,797 --> 00:03:44,996
Always stay alert, and even if my sister calls, do not answer.

70
00:03:44,997 --> 00:03:46,730
Don't talk to her, and don't even look at her.

71
00:03:46,737 --> 00:03:48,336
If I catch you talking to her,

72
00:03:48,337 --> 00:03:50,535
I'll kick you right out. Do you understand?

73
00:03:50,536 --> 00:03:51,875
- Of course. - Yes.

74
00:03:51,876 --> 00:03:53,713
Don't worry, my friend.

75
00:03:53,737 --> 00:03:56,969
Be careful. Remember her face, and never go near her.

76
00:04:05,816 --> 00:04:07,520
Why did she suddenly come?

77
00:04:08,126 --> 00:04:09,789
Was I too harsh on her?

78
00:04:10,987 --> 00:04:14,189
Whatever. If she has no place to go, she'll go to Dad's place.

79
00:04:29,307 --> 00:04:30,673
It's strange.

80
00:04:31,677 --> 00:04:33,410
All she did was put the ointment on me.

81
00:04:33,516 --> 00:04:35,016
Why was my heart pounding so much?

82
00:04:36,117 --> 00:04:37,137
Is it...

83
00:04:38,316 --> 00:04:39,714
some sort of heart disease?

84
00:04:40,187 --> 00:04:42,227
No. the medical checkup result said I'm totally fine.

85
00:04:42,326 --> 00:04:43,479
It's strange.

86
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:45,582
What are you mumbling about?

87
00:04:45,756 --> 00:04:47,051
What? It's nothing.

88
00:04:47,427 --> 00:04:48,487
What is it?

89
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:51,891
Hey, Jun Ki.

90
00:04:51,997 --> 00:04:53,796
- What? - If some girl...

91
00:04:53,797 --> 00:04:55,877
did something very ordinary,

92
00:04:55,966 --> 00:04:57,666
but if your heart starts pounding like crazy...

93
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:59,268
and you feel excited, what do you think it is?

94
00:04:59,977 --> 00:05:01,578
Your heart pounded?

95
00:05:01,706 --> 00:05:02,746
Yes.

96
00:05:02,747 --> 00:05:03,797
Your heart?

97
00:05:04,146 --> 00:05:07,015
But since your nipples are down here, is your heart here too?

98
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:09,385
Do you want to die? Stop being stupid and tell me why.

99
00:05:09,386 --> 00:05:11,284
Isn't it obvious? It's because you like her.

100
00:05:11,617 --> 00:05:13,585
What? I like her?

101
00:05:13,586 --> 00:05:15,974
Of course. Why would your heart pound if you don't like her?

102
00:05:17,756 --> 00:05:20,096
Why? Is there a girl you like?

103
00:05:20,097 --> 00:05:22,780
What? No, it's not me. It's my friend.

104
00:05:22,797 --> 00:05:23,847
Your friend?

105
00:05:23,966 --> 00:05:25,666
You don't have friends besides us because you're a jerk.

106
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:28,106
I do! What do you take me for?

107
00:05:28,107 --> 00:05:29,127
You punk!

108
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:32,875
Look at that. That temper of yours!

109
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:34,987
That's why you don't have any friends.

110
00:05:36,907 --> 00:05:39,262
It's cold. Why is it so chilly?

111
00:05:44,716 --> 00:05:45,808
What was that?

112
00:05:58,896 --> 00:06:01,080
Yu Ri, what are you doing here?

113
00:06:01,607 --> 00:06:02,728
You're still here?

114
00:06:03,307 --> 00:06:04,460
Hi, Ki Bong.

115
00:06:06,876 --> 00:06:08,438
The thing is,

116
00:06:09,506 --> 00:06:10,833
I have nowhere to go.

117
00:06:10,907 --> 00:06:13,906
- Nowhere? What do you mean? - Well...

118
00:06:15,047 --> 00:06:16,585
My roommate...

119
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:19,255
ran off with our rent deposit. That's why I got kicked out.

120
00:06:19,256 --> 00:06:20,613
My gosh, I see.

121
00:06:20,886 --> 00:06:23,406
Oh, right. Woo Shik said that I shouldn't even talk to you.

122
00:06:24,386 --> 00:06:25,549
I see.

123
00:06:25,797 --> 00:06:29,163
Right, I've done some silly things.

124
00:06:29,427 --> 00:06:30,620
I get it.

125
00:06:30,797 --> 00:06:31,918
But you see, Ki Bong,

126
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:33,723
do you know what this feels like?

127
00:06:33,797 --> 00:06:36,796
I feel as if I'm left all alone...

128
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:40,743
in this universe. That's how I feel.

129
00:06:41,206 --> 00:06:43,645
Just like how no one...

130
00:06:43,646 --> 00:06:45,676
recognizes your efforts...

131
00:06:45,677 --> 00:06:47,513
no matter how many times...

132
00:06:48,016 --> 00:06:50,189
you throw the baseball in the minor league.

133
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:53,058
If someone says, "Ki Bong, cheer up!",

134
00:06:53,357 --> 00:06:54,683
or "Kook Ki Bong, you got this!",

135
00:06:55,126 --> 00:06:56,656
that will be enough...

136
00:06:57,487 --> 00:07:01,169
for you to get the strength to rise again,

137
00:07:01,696 --> 00:07:03,501
but there's nobody around you,

138
00:07:03,566 --> 00:07:05,943
except for those who call you a useless loser...

139
00:07:06,037 --> 00:07:08,077
and point the finger at you.

140
00:07:08,706 --> 00:07:10,472
I'm talking about that loneliness.

141
00:07:12,237 --> 00:07:13,399
I do know what it's like.

142
00:07:14,636 --> 00:07:16,921
I know better than anybody else does.

143
00:07:19,576 --> 00:07:23,055
- It must've been so hard for you. - Yes.

144
00:07:24,047 --> 00:07:26,464
From now on, I'll cheer for you.

145
00:07:26,557 --> 00:07:27,710
Ki Bong, cheer up.

146
00:07:28,326 --> 00:07:31,560
- Kook Ki Bong, you got this! - Yu Ri...

147
00:07:33,727 --> 00:07:36,449
I'm in the same boat. If someone holds my hand...

148
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,939
I mean, if someone just holds this finger,

149
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:42,751
it'll give me the strength to get back up.

150
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:48,300
I'll hold it.

151
00:07:49,276 --> 00:07:50,398
Ki Bong.

152
00:07:50,446 --> 00:07:53,170
I'll be on your side.

153
00:07:53,547 --> 00:07:55,117
Even if Woo Shik turns his back on you,

154
00:07:55,716 --> 00:07:58,585
- I'll never ditch you. - Ki Bong.

155
00:07:58,586 --> 00:08:00,392
Yu Ri.

156
00:08:03,157 --> 00:08:06,360
Cha Woo Shik, that heartless punk.

157
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,472
Could that mean I actually have feelings for Soo Yeon?

158
00:08:10,896 --> 00:08:12,161
No way.

159
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,152
But why does my heart keep skipping beats?

160
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:18,209
Gosh, I must be going crazy.

161
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:23,799
Have you lost your mind?

162
00:08:24,146 --> 00:08:25,605
Otherwise, how could you do this?

163
00:08:27,146 --> 00:08:29,156
Cha Woo Shik, have you really lost your mind?

164
00:08:30,716 --> 00:08:33,266
Yes, I have. I'm sure I'm going crazy.

165
00:08:34,787 --> 00:08:35,950
I've gone mad.

166
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:38,578
What should I do?

167
00:08:39,456 --> 00:08:40,517
Darn it!

168
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,158
Come on in.

169
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:50,365
That was so nerve-racking.

170
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:52,927
- I got scared thinking he saw us. - I know, right?

171
00:08:54,106 --> 00:08:56,391
- By the way, what's with Woo Shik? - I don't know.

172
00:08:57,106 --> 00:08:58,983
Anyway, you should sleep in this guest room tonight.

173
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:00,747
- We don't have any empty rooms. - Really?

174
00:09:01,246 --> 00:09:04,103
My gosh, it sounds like your guesthouse is doing very well.

175
00:09:05,287 --> 00:09:08,592
By the way, who's that girl I've never seen before?

176
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:11,225
She's our high school alumna, Han Soo Yeon.

177
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:12,478
Really?

178
00:09:13,657 --> 00:09:16,992
Her name sounds familiar though.

179
00:09:17,196 --> 00:09:19,176
Han Soo Yeon, Han Soo Yeon...

180
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:21,668
Wasn't she Woo Shik's first love?

181
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:24,205
- How do you know that? - What do you think?

182
00:09:24,206 --> 00:09:26,136
I read all about her in Woo Shik's diary.

183
00:09:26,137 --> 00:09:29,135
There were her photos and hearts all over his diary.

184
00:09:29,476 --> 00:09:31,558
Seriously? Gosh, Woo Shik...

185
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,737
Wait.

186
00:09:32,976 --> 00:09:34,649
- You even peeked at his diary? - What?

187
00:09:34,816 --> 00:09:37,602
Hey, that's not important now.

188
00:09:37,647 --> 00:09:39,715
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

189
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:43,226
But why is that girl, Soo Yeon, here?

190
00:09:43,456 --> 00:09:46,126
From what I recall, she rejected Woo Shik in the past.

191
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:49,390
Oh, it's... She's in a bit of a situation.

192
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:53,385
Anyhow, you have to leave before Woo Shik wakes up.

193
00:09:53,496 --> 00:09:55,505
If you get caught, I'll be kicked out too. Okay?

194
00:09:56,066 --> 00:09:57,436
Okay, I heard you.

195
00:09:57,437 --> 00:10:00,089
Gosh, stop worrying so much.

196
00:10:06,417 --> 00:10:07,539
It's so warm.

197
00:10:07,877 --> 00:10:09,477
I feel much better now.

198
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:11,680
Ki Bong, hit the lights.

199
00:10:11,956 --> 00:10:14,099
- Turn off the lights. - Okay, sure.

200
00:10:18,927 --> 00:10:21,610
- Get some rest. - I will. Good night.

201
00:10:28,966 --> 00:10:30,976
- You just woke up? - Yes.

202
00:10:31,206 --> 00:10:32,808
Why did you get up so early?

203
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,537
I have a shift today.

204
00:10:35,206 --> 00:10:37,349
- Do you want a piece of toast? - No, thanks.

205
00:10:39,677 --> 00:10:41,889
I still have feelings for her?

206
00:10:42,486 --> 00:10:44,588
But why? Why would I?

207
00:10:45,316 --> 00:10:46,611
It makes no sense.

208
00:10:52,927 --> 00:10:54,629
Why are you looking at me like that?

209
00:10:54,966 --> 00:10:56,119
I'm offended.

210
00:10:56,596 --> 00:10:57,796
When did I look at you?

211
00:10:57,797 --> 00:10:59,766
I glanced that way, but it doesn't mean I looked at you!

212
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:00,960
Do you think every guy likes you?

213
00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:03,820
What? What is your problem?

214
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:06,036
Hey, why do you keep getting annoyed with me these days?

215
00:11:06,037 --> 00:11:07,536
When did I get annoyed? When?

216
00:11:10,706 --> 00:11:12,103
Just forget it.

217
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,004
Look at that. That temper of yours!

218
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:17,875
Why am I attracted to a girl like her?

219
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:20,007
Hang on.

220
00:11:20,687 --> 00:11:23,308
Is it because I've been single for way too long?

221
00:11:23,486 --> 00:11:26,556
Because I hadn't felt a woman's touch for such a long time?

222
00:11:27,027 --> 00:11:29,647
It's possible my heart fluttered momentarily for that reason.

223
00:11:30,027 --> 00:11:31,352
But what if that wasn't the reason?

224
00:11:34,566 --> 00:11:36,444
What? You want me to put this ointment on you?

225
00:11:36,507 --> 00:11:39,025
- Is that why you woke me up? - It's quite urgent.

226
00:11:39,076 --> 00:11:40,871
Put the ointment on my wound right here.

227
00:11:40,937 --> 00:11:42,345
Forget it. You do it yourself.

228
00:11:42,346 --> 00:11:43,733
Why are you asking me to do it?

229
00:11:44,106 --> 00:11:47,003
Hey, can't you just do it?

230
00:11:47,216 --> 00:11:49,215
You can't even do this for your friend? What a bad friend.

231
00:11:49,216 --> 00:11:50,410
Okay, fine.

232
00:11:51,716 --> 00:11:52,838
Good grief.

233
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:58,883
What's wrong with me? Why isn't my heart fluttering?

234
00:12:02,267 --> 00:12:04,745
Could it be because she didn't blow air on it?

235
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:07,180
Jung Eun. I'm sorry, but can you...

236
00:12:08,066 --> 00:12:10,484
- blow air on it just once? - What?

237
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:12,676
Have you gone mad? No, I don't want to.

238
00:12:12,677 --> 00:12:15,054
Hey, please! This is really important to me.

239
00:12:15,147 --> 00:12:17,655
Hey, right here.

240
00:12:18,076 --> 00:12:20,016
Blow air on it just once. Please?

241
00:12:20,017 --> 00:12:21,852
Why are you making me do something so ridiculous?

242
00:12:28,427 --> 00:12:29,854
- Are we good now? - What does this mean?

243
00:12:30,226 --> 00:12:31,225
My heart didn't flutter.

244
00:12:31,226 --> 00:12:33,235
Rather, it almost stopped because of her stinky breath.

245
00:12:33,826 --> 00:12:36,274
Well, both Jung Eun and Soo Yeon are girls.

246
00:12:36,566 --> 00:12:37,954
Why isn't my heart fluttering now?

247
00:12:39,137 --> 00:12:41,718
No, they're obviously different.

248
00:12:42,507 --> 00:12:45,015
Frankly, Jung Eun is more like a guy.

249
00:12:45,706 --> 00:12:49,684
Actually, she looks just like Sergeant Kim back in the military.

250
00:12:50,677 --> 00:12:53,329
The top marksman who was known as Terminator of our platoon.

251
00:12:53,517 --> 00:12:54,638
Sergeant Kim.

252
00:13:01,486 --> 00:13:04,486
That's it. No wonder my heart is not fluttering at all.

253
00:13:05,027 --> 00:13:07,342
I'm sure my heart will flutter if another woman puts it on for me.

254
00:13:08,326 --> 00:13:10,539
I must find someone else, another woman.

255
00:13:12,137 --> 00:13:13,932
What was that about? What's with him?

256
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:17,060
All right, shall I start cleaning the house?

257
00:13:19,437 --> 00:13:20,936
Yu Ri must be gone by now, right?

258
00:13:21,907 --> 00:13:23,070
What are you doing there?

259
00:13:24,507 --> 00:13:25,638
What?

260
00:13:27,616 --> 00:13:29,045
Yu Ri, you're still here?

261
00:13:29,586 --> 00:13:31,286
You said you'd leave before Woo Shik wakes up.

262
00:13:31,287 --> 00:13:33,907
Well, I was going to,

263
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:36,162
- but I've decided not to leave. - What?

264
00:13:36,726 --> 00:13:38,126
What are you talking about?

265
00:13:38,127 --> 00:13:41,421
- You said you'd go home. - I did say that yesterday,

266
00:13:42,427 --> 00:13:44,262
but I've had a change of heart. I'm sorry.

267
00:13:44,466 --> 00:13:46,914
Wait. Are you really going to be like this?

268
00:13:47,366 --> 00:13:49,478
Okay, fine. Do whatever you want.

269
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,835
Whether Woo Shik kicks you out or not, I don't care anymore. Okay?

270
00:13:52,836 --> 00:13:54,540
You can't say that.

271
00:13:59,746 --> 00:14:01,042
I'll hold it.

272
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:03,732
I'll be on your side.

273
00:14:04,086 --> 00:14:07,085
Even if Woo Shik turns his back on you, I'll never ditch you.

274
00:14:07,086 --> 00:14:08,413
What... What is this?

275
00:14:08,757 --> 00:14:09,955
When did you record this?

276
00:14:09,956 --> 00:14:13,903
Ki Bong, we're in the same boat now.

277
00:14:14,096 --> 00:14:16,269
So you'll have to persuade Woo Shik...

278
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,304
to let me stay here, okay?

279
00:14:18,897 --> 00:14:22,987
- Gosh! What kind of sister are you? - Ki Bong, help me change sheets.

280
00:14:24,007 --> 00:14:25,128
Ki Bong.

281
00:14:26,007 --> 00:14:27,128
Ki Bong.

282
00:14:27,186 --> 00:14:28,293
What's going on?

283
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:29,756
Who's that lady?

284
00:14:29,757 --> 00:14:31,766
Well, this is...

285
00:14:32,627 --> 00:14:34,402
Come on. Who is she?

286
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,178
What is happening?

287
00:14:40,486 --> 00:14:44,158
What on earth are you doing in our sacred guesthouse?

288
00:14:47,757 --> 00:14:49,255
Oh, okay. Point taken.

289
00:14:50,726 --> 00:14:53,011
All right, continue along.

290
00:14:55,836 --> 00:14:56,959
My gosh!

291
00:15:00,907 --> 00:15:03,293
- What was that about? - I had no choice.

292
00:15:04,307 --> 00:15:07,479
Still, how could you kiss me without my permission?

293
00:15:07,517 --> 00:15:09,245
You said we'll both get kicked out if I'm caught.

294
00:15:09,246 --> 00:15:10,818
You're driving me bonkers!

295
00:15:11,816 --> 00:15:14,585
If you don't want to go crazier,

296
00:15:14,586 --> 00:15:16,485
you'll have to persuade Woo Shik quickly. All right?

297
00:15:16,486 --> 00:15:18,873
Whatever! Darn it.

298
00:15:21,456 --> 00:15:22,751
He's cute.

299
00:15:26,066 --> 00:15:29,835
Hey, wait! Hey, what happened earlier?

300
00:15:29,836 --> 00:15:31,979
- Who's that girl? - Oh, that's...

301
00:15:32,476 --> 00:15:33,575
She's a guest.

302
00:15:33,576 --> 00:15:35,342
Hey, what? A guest?

303
00:15:35,576 --> 00:15:38,096
So you kissed one of our guests?

304
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,215
Who's this guest? Which one? Who?

305
00:15:41,216 --> 00:15:42,336
It's none of your business.

306
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:44,080
Hey, where's Woo Shik?

307
00:15:44,346 --> 00:15:45,581
Why are you asking about him?

308
00:15:45,716 --> 00:15:47,318
- Who's that girl? Tell me. - Darn it.

309
00:15:47,387 --> 00:15:49,120
- Where are all the female guests? - There he is.

310
00:15:49,456 --> 00:15:51,527
Woo Shik! Woo Shik, Woo Shik.

311
00:15:53,027 --> 00:15:54,690
- Aren't you worried about Yu Ri? - What?

312
00:15:55,027 --> 00:15:56,465
Why are you bringing up my sister?

313
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:58,466
I'm just worried about her.

314
00:15:58,527 --> 00:16:00,229
It seemed like she had nowhere to go.

315
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:02,136
Can't you just let her stay here?

316
00:16:02,137 --> 00:16:04,006
What are you talking about? Don't you remember how she is?

317
00:16:04,007 --> 00:16:05,302
She can't stay here.

318
00:16:05,706 --> 00:16:08,335
She's your sister. Aren't you worried about her even a bit?

319
00:16:08,336 --> 00:16:09,631
I said, she can't.

320
00:16:10,346 --> 00:16:11,366
What's with you?

321
00:16:11,446 --> 00:16:13,615
You heartless jerk.

322
00:16:13,616 --> 00:16:14,902
Fine, forget it!

323
00:16:18,246 --> 00:16:21,315
Where are you going? Who was that girl?

324
00:16:21,316 --> 00:16:23,571
Why did he suddenly bring up my sister?

325
00:16:24,586 --> 00:16:25,648
Another girl.

326
00:16:29,566 --> 00:16:30,617
That's a girl.

327
00:16:30,927 --> 00:16:34,232
Yes. She'll be able to make my heart race too.

328
00:16:34,566 --> 00:16:35,658
I'm sure.

329
00:16:43,177 --> 00:16:44,176
Please.

330
00:16:44,177 --> 00:16:45,197
Okay.

331
00:16:53,216 --> 00:16:55,736
What is it? Why isn't my heart racing?

332
00:16:56,326 --> 00:16:58,571
Both she and Soo Yeon are girls.

333
00:16:59,027 --> 00:17:00,965
Why can't she make my heart race?

334
00:17:01,996 --> 00:17:04,578
Wait. They're not the same.

335
00:17:05,127 --> 00:17:07,543
She is Japanese, and Soo Yeon is Korean.

336
00:17:07,796 --> 00:17:09,066
Even though they're both girls,

337
00:17:09,067 --> 00:17:11,759
Japan is hundreds of kilometres away from here.

338
00:17:12,107 --> 00:17:14,319
The psychological distance is even greater than that.

339
00:17:14,877 --> 00:17:16,713
Think about the heart-wrenching history.

340
00:17:17,276 --> 00:17:21,146
There might be a huge, invisible barrier between me and her.

341
00:17:21,147 --> 00:17:24,043
That's it. No wonder my heart isn't racing.

342
00:17:24,347 --> 00:17:26,703
I'm sure a Korean girl can make my heart race.

343
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:30,601
I need to find a Korean girl.

344
00:17:34,397 --> 00:17:36,672
No. This is not okay.

345
00:17:37,726 --> 00:17:38,920
My first kiss.

346
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:41,914
I'd been waiting for it for such a long time.

347
00:17:42,206 --> 00:17:45,603
I can't believe such an evil woman stole my first kiss.

348
00:17:46,577 --> 00:17:47,699
I have to wash it off.

349
00:17:48,177 --> 00:17:49,942
I have to wash off her evil breath.

350
00:17:50,677 --> 00:17:51,798
Her evil breath.

351
00:17:56,286 --> 00:17:58,955
What? Ki Bong kissed a customer?

352
00:17:58,956 --> 00:18:00,344
That's right.

353
00:18:00,516 --> 00:18:04,886
Very passionately in the middle of the living room at that.

354
00:18:04,887 --> 00:18:06,324
That's impressive.

355
00:18:09,427 --> 00:18:11,326
Gosh, it's him again.

356
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,560
What's wrong? Who is it?

357
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:14,695
He's one of the part-timers.

358
00:18:14,696 --> 00:18:17,216
He keeps calling me and following me around. It's driving me crazy.

359
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:19,428
You of all girls?

360
00:18:20,736 --> 00:18:22,646
He has such a peculiar taste.

361
00:18:22,647 --> 00:18:25,533
- Are you serious? - I'm just joking.

362
00:18:28,617 --> 00:18:30,416
I already turned him down. Why can't he leave me alone?

363
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:31,813
What do you not like about him?

364
00:18:31,887 --> 00:18:34,406
Well, we're not really compatible.

365
00:18:34,986 --> 00:18:38,455
But more than anything, he looks like a rabbit.

366
00:18:38,456 --> 00:18:39,885
- A rabbit? - Yes.

367
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:43,492
His front teeth are super long, and his ears are huge.

368
00:18:43,496 --> 00:18:45,866
He even has whiskers like a rabbit.

369
00:18:45,867 --> 00:18:47,366
How can a person look like that?

370
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:48,866
You're exaggerating too much.

371
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:51,066
Also, looks aren't everything.

372
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:53,178
What matters is his heart.

373
00:18:54,536 --> 00:18:56,876
Your phone is vibrating. It must be that rabbit guy.

374
00:18:56,877 --> 00:18:58,611
- It's not mine. - Something is vibrating.

375
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:01,896
Wait. Isn't this Ki Bong's phone?

376
00:19:02,147 --> 00:19:03,237
It's his coach.

377
00:19:03,486 --> 00:19:05,354
Hello, sir. This is Ki Bong's friend, Jun Ki.

378
00:19:05,716 --> 00:19:08,031
Ki Bong? Just a second.

379
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:18,484
Gosh, where is the bathroom?

380
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:20,917
Ki Bong.

381
00:19:28,276 --> 00:19:29,878
- Ki Bong. - What should I do?

382
00:19:31,377 --> 00:19:32,601
Please hold on.

383
00:19:33,877 --> 00:19:34,967
What are you doing...

384
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:37,967
Ki Bong.

385
00:19:38,617 --> 00:19:39,983
Ki Bong. Are you here?

386
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:45,307
Yes. What's the matter?

387
00:19:45,357 --> 00:19:48,213
Answer your phone. Your coach needs to talk to you urgently.

388
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:52,023
Well, I'm kind of in the middle of something here.

389
00:19:52,397 --> 00:19:55,803
What are you talking about? Your coach needs to talk to you...

390
00:19:56,637 --> 00:19:57,688
What?

391
00:20:00,437 --> 00:20:01,457
Four legs?

392
00:20:02,276 --> 00:20:03,634
There are four legs.

393
00:20:05,006 --> 00:20:06,475
Ki Bong.

394
00:20:07,046 --> 00:20:08,984
What are you doing in there?

395
00:20:09,016 --> 00:20:10,955
What... What is this?

396
00:20:19,756 --> 00:20:21,255
Oh, okay.

397
00:20:21,827 --> 00:20:24,315
Sir, Ki Bong can't talk right now.

398
00:20:24,827 --> 00:20:28,203
If you tell me what it is, I'll pass it on to him.

399
00:20:31,867 --> 00:20:33,775
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

400
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:35,470
I had no choice.

401
00:20:35,647 --> 00:20:37,076
Jun Ki almost caught me.

402
00:20:37,077 --> 00:20:39,085
Still, how could you just barge in here?

403
00:20:39,147 --> 00:20:40,268
Get out!

404
00:20:40,677 --> 00:20:42,105
Get out right now!

405
00:20:43,986 --> 00:20:46,466
Gosh, I can't believe it.

406
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:50,752
So persuade Woo Shik as soon as possible, okay?

407
00:20:51,256 --> 00:20:52,858
I said, get out!

408
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:00,418
Are we done?

409
00:21:01,097 --> 00:21:03,718
What is this? Why doesn't my heart race this time either?

410
00:21:04,337 --> 00:21:07,505
Both she and Soo Yeon are Korean girls.

411
00:21:07,506 --> 00:21:09,414
Why can't she make my heart race?

412
00:21:10,377 --> 00:21:11,428
Wait.

413
00:21:12,276 --> 00:21:14,616
Where are you from?

414
00:21:14,617 --> 00:21:15,668
Jeju Island.

415
00:21:16,147 --> 00:21:17,745
- I knew it. - Gosh.

416
00:21:17,746 --> 00:21:19,726
They're far from the same.

417
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:22,537
She is from Jeju Island while Soo Yeon is from Seoul.

418
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:25,725
Even though they're both from Korea, Jeju Island is known for...

419
00:21:25,726 --> 00:21:28,103
having a lot of wind, rocks, and women unlike Seoul.

420
00:21:28,226 --> 00:21:29,594
It also produces a lot of mandarins.

421
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:31,795
A girl who grew up in Jeju Island eating mandarins...

422
00:21:31,796 --> 00:21:33,795
can't be the same as Soo Yeon,

423
00:21:33,796 --> 00:21:35,602
who grew up in Seoul inhaling polluted air.

424
00:21:36,137 --> 00:21:38,891
That's it. That's why my heart isn't racing.

425
00:21:39,177 --> 00:21:42,196
A girl from Seoul will definitely make my heart race.

426
00:21:42,446 --> 00:21:45,057
I need to find a girl from Seoul.

427
00:21:45,377 --> 00:21:46,642
Gosh.

428
00:21:46,776 --> 00:21:48,985
Hey! Who was that girl?

429
00:21:48,986 --> 00:21:51,466
- Tell me! - Give me a break!

430
00:21:51,587 --> 00:21:53,285
Woo Shik!

431
00:21:53,286 --> 00:21:54,886
What is it now?

432
00:21:54,887 --> 00:21:56,025
Can't your sister stay here?

433
00:21:56,026 --> 00:21:58,455
Why do you keep talking about my sister?

434
00:21:58,456 --> 00:22:00,843
She's your only sibling.

435
00:22:00,857 --> 00:22:02,626
Just let her stay here.

436
00:22:02,627 --> 00:22:05,043
Please save my life.

437
00:22:05,097 --> 00:22:06,933
I already said no!

438
00:22:07,036 --> 00:22:08,965
How can you be so heartless?

439
00:22:08,966 --> 00:22:10,537
You selfish jerk!

440
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:13,106
Gosh!

441
00:22:13,107 --> 00:22:15,279
Why does he keep bringing up my sister?

442
00:22:15,806 --> 00:22:18,194
Woo Shik, big news.

443
00:22:19,117 --> 00:22:20,676
Ki Bong was in the shower...

444
00:22:20,677 --> 00:22:21,798
Whatever! I'm busy.

445
00:22:32,327 --> 00:22:35,865
That evil woman not only stole my first kiss...

446
00:22:37,427 --> 00:22:39,712
but also saw me naked.

447
00:22:49,206 --> 00:22:51,827
Hey, dummy, I'm hungry.

448
00:22:52,716 --> 00:22:55,196
I don't care if you starve to death.

449
00:22:58,647 --> 00:23:00,356
I haven't had pizza in forever.

450
00:23:00,357 --> 00:23:02,224
- I know. - Jung Eun.

451
00:23:02,556 --> 00:23:03,725
Are you here?

452
00:23:03,726 --> 00:23:05,725
It's that guy.

453
00:23:05,726 --> 00:23:06,880
Who?

454
00:23:07,496 --> 00:23:08,695
That rabbit guy?

455
00:23:08,696 --> 00:23:10,295
Tell him I'm not here, okay?

456
00:23:10,296 --> 00:23:12,990
Hey, do you really have to hide?

457
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,460
Why...

458
00:23:15,597 --> 00:23:17,238
Is Jung Eun here?

459
00:23:19,137 --> 00:23:20,227
Well, no.

460
00:23:20,377 --> 00:23:21,529
I haven't seen her.

461
00:23:21,736 --> 00:23:24,837
You haven't? She won't pick up her phone. I wonder where she is.

462
00:23:29,446 --> 00:23:30,507
Jung Eun!

463
00:23:32,387 --> 00:23:34,733
Jung Eun, wait! Jung Eun!

464
00:23:36,956 --> 00:23:38,110
Jung Eun, wait!

465
00:23:39,256 --> 00:23:40,317
Jung Eun!

466
00:23:41,696 --> 00:23:42,787
Just a second, Jung Eun.

467
00:23:46,996 --> 00:23:48,057
Just a second.

468
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:52,005
What is it? You should have knocked.

469
00:23:52,006 --> 00:23:53,945
Sorry. I'm kind of in trouble.

470
00:23:55,506 --> 00:23:56,567
Jung Eun!

471
00:23:57,107 --> 00:24:00,033
- What should I do? - Can we talk for a minute?

472
00:24:02,546 --> 00:24:03,638
Hey!

473
00:24:04,246 --> 00:24:06,215
Ki Bong, if he comes in here, tell him I'm not here.

474
00:24:06,216 --> 00:24:08,021
No. Tell him I'm dead, okay?

475
00:24:09,486 --> 00:24:10,956
What are you doing?

476
00:24:20,996 --> 00:24:23,311
Why won't Ki Bong pick up his phone?

477
00:24:23,736 --> 00:24:25,062
I'm starving.

478
00:24:32,577 --> 00:24:34,820
How can a person look so much like a rabbit?

479
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,046
I still can't believe it.

480
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:43,457
Ki Bong must be hungry too.

481
00:24:43,556 --> 00:24:45,220
I should get him some pizza.

482
00:24:57,966 --> 00:24:59,160
Who is it now?

483
00:25:00,077 --> 00:25:02,745
- What are you doing here? - Hey, I'm in trouble.

484
00:25:02,746 --> 00:25:04,847
- Ki Bong! - Darn it.

485
00:25:06,476 --> 00:25:08,176
- Move. - What are you doing?

486
00:25:08,177 --> 00:25:10,053
Are you crazy?

487
00:25:10,187 --> 00:25:12,053
Ki Bong, eat some pizza.

488
00:25:12,117 --> 00:25:13,513
You have so many legs.

489
00:25:15,986 --> 00:25:17,721
Why do you have so many legs? 2, 4, 6.

490
00:25:18,327 --> 00:25:19,378
Six legs.

491
00:25:21,127 --> 00:25:22,523
Six legs?

492
00:25:23,526 --> 00:25:24,618
Ki Bong.

493
00:25:25,367 --> 00:25:27,642
Are you...

494
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:29,442
Jun Ki, that's not it.

495
00:25:34,476 --> 00:25:36,077
Oh, okay.

496
00:25:37,847 --> 00:25:39,815
Ki Bong, you don't have to eat pizza right now.

497
00:25:41,077 --> 00:25:42,076
Have a good time!

498
00:25:42,077 --> 00:25:44,215
Jun Ki, that's not it.

499
00:25:44,216 --> 00:25:45,920
- Have fun! - Hey!

500
00:25:47,357 --> 00:25:49,703
Hey, what is this?

501
00:25:50,927 --> 00:25:52,007
Has Jun Ki left?

502
00:25:53,157 --> 00:25:54,177
Has the rabbit guy left?

503
00:25:54,996 --> 00:25:56,425
- Yu Ri. - Jung Eun.

504
00:25:57,927 --> 00:25:59,497
Darn!

505
00:26:04,837 --> 00:26:05,999
This is driving me nuts.

506
00:26:06,706 --> 00:26:10,041
It's hard to find someone born and raised in Seoul. What should I do?

507
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:13,364
Shall we begin the interview then?

508
00:26:14,147 --> 00:26:15,846
Let's see.

509
00:26:15,847 --> 00:26:18,804
Your name is Han Soo Yeon?

510
00:26:19,486 --> 00:26:20,609
Yes.

511
00:26:20,716 --> 00:26:22,900
And you live in Huam-dong.

512
00:26:23,387 --> 00:26:25,626
Yes. I've always lived...

513
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:28,615
- in Huam-dong since I was born. - Really?

514
00:26:29,427 --> 00:26:31,225
Your father's business went bankrupt?

515
00:26:31,226 --> 00:26:32,225
Yes.

516
00:26:32,226 --> 00:26:36,082
My father was conned, and his business went bankrupt.

517
00:26:36,367 --> 00:26:38,345
I ended up canceling my marriage because of that too.

518
00:26:39,276 --> 00:26:41,826
I'm staying at a high school friend's house for now.

519
00:26:45,107 --> 00:26:46,269
Excuse me.

520
00:26:55,256 --> 00:26:56,003
What's wrong?

521
00:26:56,509 --> 00:26:58,027
Why isn't my heart racing?

522
00:26:58,427 --> 00:27:00,599
She's a Korean girl, just like Soo Yeon.

523
00:27:00,696 --> 00:27:01,955
She was born and raised in Seoul.

524
00:27:01,956 --> 00:27:03,666
Her marriage was canceled because of her father's bankruptcy.

525
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:05,257
She's even living at her high school friend's house.

526
00:27:05,526 --> 00:27:07,066
She even has the same name.

527
00:27:07,236 --> 00:27:09,072
But why isn't my heart racing?

528
00:27:10,206 --> 00:27:11,462
Darn it.

529
00:27:13,907 --> 00:27:17,109
Hold on. Does this mean that I really like Soo Yeon?

530
00:27:17,907 --> 00:27:20,293
It's been 10 years since I graduated from high school.

531
00:27:22,177 --> 00:27:24,186
I still have feelings for her?

532
00:27:25,016 --> 00:27:26,180
Does that make sense?

533
00:27:28,016 --> 00:27:29,485
It can't be.

534
00:27:29,887 --> 00:27:30,955
No way.

535
00:27:30,956 --> 00:27:32,150
Woo Shik.

536
00:27:36,996 --> 00:27:38,251
(School Uniform Discount Event)

537
00:28:05,087 --> 00:28:06,423
Woo Shik, what brings you here?

538
00:28:09,026 --> 00:28:11,210
Hey, what's wrong?

539
00:28:11,726 --> 00:28:12,859
Are you sick?

540
00:28:23,206 --> 00:28:24,328
No way.

541
00:28:26,847 --> 00:28:29,773
No. This can't be!

542
00:28:30,587 --> 00:28:32,799
No!

543
00:28:33,117 --> 00:28:35,299
No!

544
00:28:35,587 --> 00:28:38,075
What's wrong? What's up with him?

545
00:28:41,657 --> 00:28:43,329
I'm begging you.

546
00:28:43,766 --> 00:28:46,450
Please help my friend Ki Bong have fun...

547
00:28:48,397 --> 00:28:49,896
Are they still in front of the door?

548
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,843
Yes. They're not budging an inch.

549
00:28:55,877 --> 00:28:57,579
Anyway, Jung Eun,

550
00:28:57,877 --> 00:29:00,545
you better not tell Woo Shik that you saw me.

551
00:29:00,546 --> 00:29:01,842
Okay, Yu Ri.

552
00:29:02,276 --> 00:29:04,898
This is insane. Woo Shik will be coming back soon.

553
00:29:05,817 --> 00:29:07,356
What will you do now?

554
00:29:07,357 --> 00:29:09,586
Hey, no matter what it takes,

555
00:29:09,587 --> 00:29:11,974
you have to take Jun Ki and that rabbit guy outside.

556
00:29:13,456 --> 00:29:14,547
Okay.

557
00:29:15,427 --> 00:29:16,548
Are you still here?

558
00:29:16,766 --> 00:29:19,636
Well, Jung Eun went into this room and she isn't coming out.

559
00:29:19,637 --> 00:29:21,735
No, she's not. Jung Eun wasn't in there.

560
00:29:21,736 --> 00:29:24,592
- I saw her going in there. - You did?

561
00:29:26,006 --> 00:29:27,740
If you're hungry, would you like some pizza?

562
00:29:27,877 --> 00:29:29,579
- Do you want some carrots? - No!

563
00:29:29,946 --> 00:29:33,281
- I hate carrots! - You look like you love carrots.

564
00:29:34,046 --> 00:29:36,146
Hey, Ki Bong. What was going on in there?

565
00:29:36,147 --> 00:29:37,515
What did you do in your bed?

566
00:29:37,516 --> 00:29:38,686
It's a misunderstanding.

567
00:29:38,687 --> 00:29:40,625
Come on. I saw it.

568
00:29:40,857 --> 00:29:42,285
I saw six legs underneath the blanket.

569
00:29:42,286 --> 00:29:44,126
I'm sure two of them belonged to you.

570
00:29:44,127 --> 00:29:47,319
Then who does the other four belong to? Tell me.

571
00:29:47,696 --> 00:29:49,563
- Come on. - Wait.

572
00:29:49,627 --> 00:29:51,795
I'll tell you everything, so let's go upstairs and talk.

573
00:29:51,796 --> 00:29:53,805
Really? You'll tell me everything?

574
00:29:54,196 --> 00:29:55,836
Don't leave out any details.

575
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:57,132
All right, already.

576
00:29:57,706 --> 00:29:58,787
Oh, my goodness!

577
00:29:59,367 --> 00:30:01,035
You should come with me too.

578
00:30:01,036 --> 00:30:02,608
Me? Why?

579
00:30:02,637 --> 00:30:05,636
I'll tell you something funny and give you carrots, so follow me.

580
00:30:05,706 --> 00:30:09,286
- I said, I hate carrots! - Come on, follow me.

581
00:30:11,716 --> 00:30:14,062
Yu Ri, it's all clear. Come on out.

582
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:20,630
No!

583
00:30:25,796 --> 00:30:28,081
Why is my heart racing again? Why?

584
00:30:29,236 --> 00:30:31,175
I think I really like Soo Yeon.

585
00:30:33,006 --> 00:30:34,945
Seriously, this is driving me crazy.

586
00:30:41,476 --> 00:30:43,119
Goodness.

587
00:30:49,786 --> 00:30:50,979
How did this thing roll on its own?

588
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:55,103
Wait, I think it was a different one.

589
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:00,952
Right! It's this one.

590
00:31:01,796 --> 00:31:03,398
Wait a minute.

591
00:31:08,437 --> 00:31:09,600
Brother.

592
00:31:10,776 --> 00:31:12,000
Hi.

593
00:31:15,317 --> 00:31:16,485
Get out now!

594
00:31:16,486 --> 00:31:20,434
I can't handle any more of your trouble, so get out.

595
00:31:21,556 --> 00:31:23,225
I won't cause trouble anymore.

596
00:31:23,226 --> 00:31:26,656
I'll behave really well from now on. Come on, Woo Shik.

597
00:31:26,657 --> 00:31:29,787
Forget it. You can't fool me anymore, so get out.

598
00:31:30,726 --> 00:31:32,826
Hey. You're so mean.

599
00:31:32,827 --> 00:31:35,265
You're even letting your first love, Soo Yeon, stay here.

600
00:31:35,266 --> 00:31:36,606
But why can't I stay?

601
00:31:36,607 --> 00:31:38,965
She did something wrong a long time ago too.

602
00:31:38,966 --> 00:31:42,067
So you cursed her and even ripped all of her pictures.

603
00:31:42,107 --> 00:31:43,372
What? That's ridiculous.

604
00:31:43,706 --> 00:31:46,327
- How do you know that? - It was written in your diary...

605
00:31:46,877 --> 00:31:48,987
What? Did you peek at my diary?

606
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:55,519
Oh, right. You like her, don't you?

607
00:31:56,256 --> 00:31:58,755
Like her? Who says that?

608
00:31:58,756 --> 00:32:00,396
I heard everything you just said.

609
00:32:00,397 --> 00:32:03,283
- You heard wrong. - Really? Is that so?

610
00:32:08,337 --> 00:32:10,274
I think I really like Soo Yeon.

611
00:32:11,837 --> 00:32:13,060
When did you...

612
00:32:17,647 --> 00:32:18,876
Delete that right now.

613
00:32:18,877 --> 00:32:21,631
Why? You don't want Soo Yeon to find out?

614
00:32:22,546 --> 00:32:23,944
Is that so?

615
00:32:27,456 --> 00:32:28,610
Thank you.

616
00:32:31,726 --> 00:32:33,837
- Brother, coke. - Okay, Yu Ri.

617
00:32:37,827 --> 00:32:39,357
- Pickles. - Okay.

618
00:32:40,837 --> 00:32:41,918
Here.

619
00:32:43,306 --> 00:32:44,388
Does it taste refreshing?

620
00:32:46,036 --> 00:32:47,944
Hey, what is up with you?

621
00:32:48,206 --> 00:32:50,696
- You said you'd never take her in. - What?

622
00:32:51,476 --> 00:32:53,116
It seems like she regrets her wrongdoings.

623
00:32:53,117 --> 00:32:55,116
Also, she's my one and only sister,

624
00:32:55,177 --> 00:32:56,442
so I can't just turn my back on her.

625
00:33:02,587 --> 00:33:04,219
What is going on now?

626
00:33:06,087 --> 00:33:09,085
Hey, Ki Bong. That girl that you were with. No...

627
00:33:09,726 --> 00:33:12,960
The girls that you were with. Who were they? Tell us.

628
00:33:13,837 --> 00:33:15,896
- You don't have to know. - What girls?

629
00:33:15,897 --> 00:33:18,252
Ki Bong shared his first kiss and first shower...

630
00:33:19,107 --> 00:33:21,436
with a girl who he had just met...

631
00:33:21,437 --> 00:33:24,742
Hold on. So was that Ki Bong's first kiss?

632
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:25,906
Yes!

633
00:33:25,907 --> 00:33:27,376
I see.

634
00:33:27,776 --> 00:33:29,041
Gosh, seriously!

636
00:33:51,306 --> 00:33:54,500
Hey, face reader. Do I have the face of a king?

637
00:33:54,776 --> 00:33:57,633
- What do you think you're... - Do I have a strange face?

638
00:33:57,806 --> 00:33:59,945
Even a famous face reader is speechless.

639
00:33:59,946 --> 00:34:02,802
- What are you... - I'll change the question then.

640
00:34:03,117 --> 00:34:04,269
Hey, Director.

641
00:34:04,516 --> 00:34:06,386
Do I have the face of a male lead?

642
00:34:06,387 --> 00:34:08,866
Or the face of a supporting role? If not,

643
00:34:12,087 --> 00:34:13,483
will I fail this audition?

644
00:34:15,397 --> 00:34:18,967
Looking at your face, it just seems like I've failed again.

645
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:21,165
Why can't you say anything?

646
00:34:22,237 --> 00:34:24,042
Do I have the face of a male lead?

647
00:34:24,706 --> 00:34:26,410
Or the face of a supporting role?

648
00:34:35,647 --> 00:34:39,013
But why? Why Han Soo Yeon, of all people?

649
00:34:40,556 --> 00:34:42,321
How much more will I make a fool of myself?

650
00:34:44,187 --> 00:34:45,451
I've lost my mind.

651
00:34:45,656 --> 00:34:46,747
Woo Shik.

652
00:34:47,757 --> 00:34:49,328
Hey, what are you two doing here?

653
00:34:52,866 --> 00:34:55,995
- Why are you here? - You left your cellphone at home.

654
00:34:55,996 --> 00:34:57,466
I brought it for you. Here.

655
00:34:57,737 --> 00:35:00,562
- Oh. Thanks. - Sure.

656
00:35:00,837 --> 00:35:01,975
Soo Yeon, what about you?

657
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:05,923
Well, Yu Ri suddenly asked me to come with her.

658
00:35:06,377 --> 00:35:09,015
I mean, I just wanted to see...

659
00:35:09,016 --> 00:35:10,845
where my brother works.

660
00:35:10,846 --> 00:35:13,468
I was wondering if we could have a cup of tea.

661
00:35:16,286 --> 00:35:17,918
You know what I mean, right?

662
00:35:18,226 --> 00:35:19,512
What's wrong with you?

663
00:35:21,226 --> 00:35:23,325
Wait. Looking at you two like this,

664
00:35:23,326 --> 00:35:26,632
you and Soo Yeon look quite good together.

665
00:35:26,967 --> 00:35:28,089
Just like a couple.

666
00:35:28,297 --> 00:35:30,035
What are you suddenly talking about?

667
00:35:30,036 --> 00:35:32,566
It's just that you two look so great together.

668
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:34,616
I can't believe it. It's like you're soul mates.

669
00:35:35,337 --> 00:35:37,826
Yu Ri, let's go have a talk.

670
00:35:38,306 --> 00:35:39,470
Excuse me.

671
00:35:44,246 --> 00:35:47,071
- What is this nonsense? - Don't say that.

672
00:35:47,317 --> 00:35:49,155
I'm doing this all for you.

673
00:35:49,156 --> 00:35:50,425
For me?

674
00:35:50,426 --> 00:35:51,956
You said you like her.

675
00:35:52,357 --> 00:35:54,365
So I just wanted to be of help.

676
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:57,566
I'll set the mood for you, so don't worry.

677
00:35:57,567 --> 00:36:00,466
You can count on me, okay?

678
00:36:00,467 --> 00:36:01,619
Are you out of your mind?

679
00:36:03,737 --> 00:36:05,439
I never asked you to help me with Soo Yeon.

680
00:36:05,766 --> 00:36:07,542
I don't want to make a fool of myself anymore,

681
00:36:08,076 --> 00:36:10,014
so please don't do anything.

682
00:36:14,016 --> 00:36:16,668
Make a fool of himself? What does he mean by that?

683
00:36:16,817 --> 00:36:21,610
(The Story That Only I Didn't Know)

684
00:36:24,386 --> 00:36:27,026
Pardon me? Director Hong Il Seok recommended me?

685
00:36:27,027 --> 00:36:28,179
That's right.

686
00:36:28,627 --> 00:36:30,325
I look forward to working with you.

687
00:36:30,326 --> 00:36:32,846
Thank you. Thank you so much.

688
00:36:33,366 --> 00:36:37,039
I've been depressed because I kept failing every audition.

689
00:36:37,536 --> 00:36:38,791
Thank you again.

690
00:36:39,737 --> 00:36:41,975
By the way, what kind of role will it be?

691
00:36:41,976 --> 00:36:44,046
Oh, it'll be the male lead...

692
00:36:44,047 --> 00:36:45,146
The male lead?

693
00:36:45,147 --> 00:36:46,431
The male lead's stand-in.

694
00:36:46,917 --> 00:36:48,046
Stand-in?

695
00:36:48,047 --> 00:36:49,845
From your physique and everything else,

696
00:36:49,846 --> 00:36:52,468
you look very much like the male lead of our movie.

697
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:55,155
If it's a stand-in, I'm not sure...

698
00:36:55,156 --> 00:36:57,911
If you help me out this time,

699
00:36:58,357 --> 00:37:01,151
I'll give you a substantial role in my next movie.

700
00:37:01,596 --> 00:37:03,871
Seriously? My gosh.

701
00:37:04,426 --> 00:37:07,595
I'll work hard. I'll do my best!

702
00:37:07,596 --> 00:37:08,616
Great!

703
00:37:10,107 --> 00:37:12,836
Then who's the male lead?

704
00:37:12,837 --> 00:37:15,019
Oh. There he is!

705
00:37:16,576 --> 00:37:18,891
That's... Yu Min!

706
00:37:20,877 --> 00:37:22,305
- Hey. - Hello.

707
00:37:24,147 --> 00:37:26,563
I'm a busy man. Why did you want me to come all the way here?

708
00:37:27,516 --> 00:37:29,831
- Who's this? - He'll be your stand-in.

709
00:37:30,087 --> 00:37:31,155
Say hi.

710
00:37:31,156 --> 00:37:32,785
Jun Ki. You know Yu Min, right?

711
00:37:32,786 --> 00:37:34,154
Yes, of course.

712
00:37:34,226 --> 00:37:36,980
Who wouldn't know the top star, Yu Min?

713
00:37:37,697 --> 00:37:40,144
It's an honor to meet you. I'm actor Lee Jun Ki.

714
00:37:40,237 --> 00:37:43,066
Well, I don't really need to know your name.

715
00:37:43,067 --> 00:37:44,943
- Pardon me? - Let's be a good team.

716
00:37:48,437 --> 00:37:49,528
Oh, okay.

717
00:37:57,047 --> 00:37:58,679
Leave when you're done with it. I have to work.

718
00:37:58,717 --> 00:38:00,491
Okay, I heard you.

719
00:38:01,516 --> 00:38:05,300
Soo Yeon, I heard you were Woo Shik's first love.

720
00:38:05,527 --> 00:38:06,577
Sorry?

721
00:38:06,897 --> 00:38:08,560
Well, that's what I heard.

722
00:38:08,826 --> 00:38:09,878
I see.

723
00:38:10,866 --> 00:38:14,296
Then was Woo Shik your first love as well?

724
00:38:14,297 --> 00:38:16,235
What? Of course not.

725
00:38:16,567 --> 00:38:18,474
Why would I like such a loser?

726
00:38:20,576 --> 00:38:23,187
Yu Ri, my first love back in high school was a different guy.

727
00:38:23,206 --> 00:38:25,305
He was so handsome and cool...

728
00:38:25,306 --> 00:38:26,806
What's wrong with my brother?

729
00:38:27,717 --> 00:38:31,285
He's the only one in our family with an IQ of over 100.

730
00:38:31,286 --> 00:38:33,615
Once in elementary school, his exam score was the 15th highest in class.

731
00:38:33,616 --> 00:38:34,655
- Yu Ri. - What?

732
00:38:34,656 --> 00:38:36,725
Enough, please. It's nothing to brag about.

733
00:38:36,726 --> 00:38:39,225
It is brag-worthy. It's an amazing achievement, don't you think?

734
00:38:39,226 --> 00:38:40,256
Woo Shik.

735
00:38:40,257 --> 00:38:41,347
Yes, sir.

736
00:38:41,627 --> 00:38:44,626
This singer will perform at our pub starting today.

737
00:38:44,627 --> 00:38:46,196
- Say hi. - Oh, hello.

738
00:38:46,197 --> 00:38:47,258
Hello.

739
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:49,496
- Seo Jun. - Woo Shik.

740
00:38:52,607 --> 00:38:53,627
Soo Yeon.

741
00:38:55,906 --> 00:38:56,968
Seo Jun.

742
00:38:59,706 --> 00:39:01,584
My gosh, how long has it been?

743
00:39:02,116 --> 00:39:03,646
Isn't this the first time since graduation?

744
00:39:03,647 --> 00:39:05,146
I think it is. How have you been?

745
00:39:05,147 --> 00:39:06,316
I've been doing all right.

746
00:39:06,317 --> 00:39:08,986
By the way, how did you guys end up living together?

747
00:39:08,987 --> 00:39:10,048
What?

748
00:39:12,257 --> 00:39:13,755
There was a bit of a situation.

749
00:39:14,596 --> 00:39:16,841
Really? Anyway, it's nice to see you guys.

750
00:39:17,226 --> 00:39:18,348
Shall we drink?

751
00:39:20,366 --> 00:39:21,535
Gosh, I finished this bottle.

752
00:39:21,536 --> 00:39:22,690
I'll go bring you a new one.

753
00:39:22,967 --> 00:39:24,159
Okay, thank you.

754
00:39:24,967 --> 00:39:27,526
By the way, you've gotten even prettier.

755
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,280
You've gotten more handsome yourself.

756
00:39:37,147 --> 00:39:40,146
(High School Band Association Concert)

757
00:39:48,426 --> 00:39:51,282
That's Soo Yeon. Why is she so early today?

758
00:40:02,777 --> 00:40:04,409
("I Love You")

759
00:40:15,886 --> 00:40:18,070
(High School Band Association Concert)

760
00:40:22,257 --> 00:40:23,420
- Here. - Oh, thank you.

761
00:40:26,397 --> 00:40:28,171
So you're going to perform here from now on?

762
00:40:28,366 --> 00:40:29,566
Yes, for about...

763
00:40:29,567 --> 00:40:32,219
Brother, who's that guy?

764
00:40:32,467 --> 00:40:34,276
He was in our band back in high school.

765
00:40:34,277 --> 00:40:35,358
Really?

766
00:40:35,507 --> 00:40:39,220
But I must say, it looks like something's up between those two.

767
00:40:39,346 --> 00:40:40,774
Something's going on, right?

768
00:40:41,516 --> 00:40:43,588
Tell me. What's their relationship?

769
00:40:43,687 --> 00:40:45,013
He's Soo Yeon's first love.

770
00:40:45,187 --> 00:40:47,910
What? That guy is Soo Yeon's first love?

771
00:40:48,616 --> 00:40:49,739
So in other words,

772
00:40:50,326 --> 00:40:53,256
you had a crush on her, but she had a crush on that guy?

773
00:40:53,257 --> 00:40:54,420
I don't know.

774
00:40:54,797 --> 00:40:55,817
So that's not the case?

775
00:40:57,826 --> 00:40:59,663
I feel so bad for my brother.

776
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:06,166
Today is a good day. Let's have a drink, okay?

777
00:41:12,107 --> 00:41:14,830
Who's this wimp crying and ruining the mood?

778
00:41:21,156 --> 00:41:22,385
It's me, you jerk.

779
00:41:22,386 --> 00:41:25,080
Oh, it's you, Oh Dae Shik.

780
00:41:25,226 --> 00:41:26,756
For the past 10 years,

781
00:41:27,797 --> 00:41:29,969
I kept promising myself in tears.

782
00:41:30,866 --> 00:41:32,763
But did you jerks really have to do that?

783
00:41:33,197 --> 00:41:34,665
From our sashimi restaurant...

784
00:41:35,766 --> 00:41:36,858
to my mom,

785
00:41:37,866 --> 00:41:40,427
did you really have to take...

786
00:41:41,906 --> 00:41:45,075
everything away from me? You scumbags.

787
00:41:45,076 --> 00:41:48,309
How dare you cause a scene here? Do you have a death wish?

788
00:41:55,487 --> 00:41:57,904
Okay! That's it!

789
00:41:59,757 --> 00:42:02,455
Do exactly what Jun Ki did in the rehearsal just now.

790
00:42:02,456 --> 00:42:04,507
- Got it, Yu Min? - Yes, sure.

791
00:42:05,627 --> 00:42:08,289
All right, let's get rolling!

792
00:42:10,837 --> 00:42:11,927
Have a good shoot.

793
00:42:13,036 --> 00:42:14,205
Have a good shoot.

794
00:42:14,206 --> 00:42:16,035
That rude jerk.

795
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:18,046
Thank you. Have a good shoot.

796
00:42:18,047 --> 00:42:20,716
Jun Ki, I'm sorry for making you rehearse on behalf of him.

797
00:42:20,717 --> 00:42:23,399
Gosh, it's totally fine. Please don't worry about me.

798
00:42:27,116 --> 00:42:29,916
From our sashimi restaurant to my mom,

799
00:42:29,917 --> 00:42:33,977
did you really have to take everything away from me?

800
00:42:33,996 --> 00:42:35,196
You scumbags.

801
00:42:35,197 --> 00:42:38,664
How dare you cause a scene here? Do you have a death wish?

802
00:42:42,136 --> 00:42:43,973
- Hold on a second. - Cut!

803
00:42:45,237 --> 00:42:47,635
Yu Min, what is it? What's the matter?

804
00:42:47,636 --> 00:42:50,125
I have to shoot a TV commercial this week.

805
00:42:50,346 --> 00:42:51,905
Let's use a stand-in for the action scenes.

806
00:42:51,906 --> 00:42:55,446
A stand-in? Come on. We need you to do this.

807
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:58,385
Then will you take responsibility if I end up with a scar on my face?

808
00:42:58,386 --> 00:43:00,661
Oh, no. All right.

809
00:43:01,717 --> 00:43:03,144
- Hey, Jun Ki! - Yes!

810
00:43:03,156 --> 00:43:04,789
- We need you now. - Okay!

811
00:43:07,826 --> 00:43:11,796
I don't think he should collapse on the floor after getting punched.

812
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,735
How about he flies and land on that table...

813
00:43:14,096 --> 00:43:16,616
No, that's too small. Oh, yes.

814
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:21,236
That table over there. He should smash it as he's falling down.

815
00:43:21,237 --> 00:43:24,643
My gosh, I don't think that's necessary.

816
00:43:25,547 --> 00:43:27,760
Don't you know that this is my first action movie?

817
00:43:27,877 --> 00:43:30,245
It has to be done properly for the sake of my reputation.

818
00:43:30,246 --> 00:43:33,816
Also, you know that you got the investment because of me.

819
00:43:33,817 --> 00:43:36,256
All right. We'll try it, then.

820
00:43:36,257 --> 00:43:41,055
Jun Ki, you'll fly and land on that table.

821
00:43:41,056 --> 00:43:42,658
- Pardon me? - Okay?

822
00:43:43,357 --> 00:43:45,265
Oh, sure. Got it.

823
00:43:45,266 --> 00:43:46,654
Good. You can do it.

824
00:43:47,197 --> 00:43:50,429
- Then let's get rolling again. - My gosh.

825
00:43:51,866 --> 00:43:54,794
Do a good job. It must look real. Don't ruin my reputation.

826
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,262
Yes, of course. I got it.

827
00:44:18,726 --> 00:44:21,827
Oh, no. It looks like you've lost your vigor.

828
00:44:21,967 --> 00:44:23,035
Are you already exhausted?

829
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:27,276
Must you provoke me like this?

830
00:44:27,277 --> 00:44:29,144
Goodness, this punk still hasn't learned his lesson.

831
00:44:29,476 --> 00:44:30,528
On your knees.

832
00:44:31,076 --> 00:44:32,168
On your knees!

833
00:44:34,116 --> 00:44:35,575
Hold on a second!

834
00:44:35,576 --> 00:44:36,716
Cut! What's up?

835
00:44:36,717 --> 00:44:38,654
Let's use my stand-in from here on.

836
00:44:38,987 --> 00:44:41,231
I can't get any bruises on my knees.

837
00:44:41,286 --> 00:44:43,428
Summer is just around the corner, and I won't be able to wear shorts.

838
00:44:44,587 --> 00:44:46,586
Oh, okay. Jun Ki!

839
00:44:46,587 --> 00:44:47,648
Yes?

840
00:44:47,926 --> 00:44:48,946
We need you.

841
00:44:50,156 --> 00:44:52,166
Oh, sure. I'm coming.

842
00:45:00,636 --> 00:45:03,666
Did you really have to feed me...

843
00:45:04,206 --> 00:45:07,277
jajangmyeon as my last meal?

844
00:45:09,417 --> 00:45:10,468
Jajangmyeon...

845
00:45:11,886 --> 00:45:13,549
- Just a second! - Cut!

846
00:45:14,687 --> 00:45:16,900
Director, let's have my stand-in do this scene.

847
00:45:17,127 --> 00:45:19,486
- I'm bad at using chopsticks. - What?

848
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,095
All right. Jun Ki.

849
00:45:21,096 --> 00:45:22,280
- Yes? - We need you.

850
00:45:24,627 --> 00:45:25,718
Okay, sure.

851
00:45:30,726 --> 00:45:32,224
Gosh, your pain relief patch smells too strong.

852
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:33,653
I can't taste anything.

853
00:45:33,726 --> 00:45:35,594
How many pain relief patches did you put on?

854
00:45:35,595 --> 00:45:36,789
I don't even know.

855
00:45:36,825 --> 00:45:38,937
My whole body aches.

856
00:45:39,535 --> 00:45:42,205
Why did you take the stand-in role when your face won't even show?

857
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:45,602
The director promised that he'd cast me in his next movie.

858
00:45:45,836 --> 00:45:46,926
I have to...

859
00:45:50,646 --> 00:45:52,859
Hello. Yes.

860
00:45:53,316 --> 00:45:54,366
What?

861
00:45:55,016 --> 00:45:56,852
Okay. I'll be right there.

862
00:45:57,555 --> 00:45:59,861
- Who was it? - It was Yu Min.

863
00:46:00,016 --> 00:46:01,719
He wants me to come over to his place right now.

864
00:46:02,155 --> 00:46:03,308
See you later.

865
00:46:04,456 --> 00:46:06,795
- Eat slowly. - See you.

866
00:46:06,796 --> 00:46:08,498
- See you. - See you.

867
00:46:09,626 --> 00:46:11,533
I hope things will work out for him.

868
00:46:11,965 --> 00:46:13,903
I feel so sorry for him.

869
00:46:14,836 --> 00:46:18,039
Ki Bong, worry about making it to the Major League instead.

870
00:46:18,305 --> 00:46:20,304
You should feel sorry for yourself.

871
00:46:20,305 --> 00:46:21,468
What?

872
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:23,778
I'm better than you at least.

873
00:46:23,845 --> 00:46:25,784
You're living off your brother and his friends.

874
00:46:25,876 --> 00:46:28,784
What? I'm living off you guys? Are you serious?

875
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:30,214
- You're living off... - Stop it!

876
00:46:30,215 --> 00:46:31,643
We're in the middle of a meal.

877
00:46:31,916 --> 00:46:33,154
Gosh, you startled me.

878
00:46:33,155 --> 00:46:34,685
- Is anyone here? - Yes?

879
00:46:34,686 --> 00:46:35,807
Who is it?

880
00:46:39,626 --> 00:46:40,716
Seo Jun.

881
00:46:41,526 --> 00:46:42,689
Ki Bong.

882
00:46:43,595 --> 00:46:45,605
- It's been such a long time. - I know.

883
00:46:45,896 --> 00:46:48,605
- I actually heard about you. - We went to high school together.

884
00:46:48,606 --> 00:46:49,890
What are you doing here?

885
00:46:50,166 --> 00:46:52,247
I just wanted to see you guys after all these years.

886
00:46:53,106 --> 00:46:55,390
I'm glad you came. Come here.

887
00:47:02,046 --> 00:47:05,044
What's going on? Why did he show up here?

888
00:47:06,715 --> 00:47:08,025
Could it be because of Soo Yeon?

889
00:47:08,026 --> 00:47:09,209
Who knows?

890
00:47:11,896 --> 00:47:13,253
Brother.

891
00:47:17,396 --> 00:47:18,926
My brother must be worried.

892
00:47:20,965 --> 00:47:22,088
I have no choice.

893
00:47:24,075 --> 00:47:25,666
I'll have to step in.

894
00:47:28,476 --> 00:47:29,771
I can't see anything.

895
00:47:32,746 --> 00:47:35,045
- I can't see him. - Where is he?

896
00:47:35,046 --> 00:47:36,815
He must have ordered jajangmyeon.

897
00:47:36,816 --> 00:47:38,040
- He ordered jajangmyeon? - Oh, my.

898
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:39,714
He'll be able to see him.

899
00:47:39,715 --> 00:47:41,316
- Are you going in there? - Can you see him?

900
00:47:42,925 --> 00:47:44,660
- Unbelievable. - Are you going in?

901
00:47:46,595 --> 00:47:48,194
Jajangmyeon with extra pickled radish.

902
00:47:48,195 --> 00:47:51,194
Gosh, what took you so long?

903
00:47:51,195 --> 00:47:52,318
Well...

904
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:56,042
I left as soon as I got off the phone.

905
00:47:56,505 --> 00:47:58,804
Why did you want me to put on a disguise?

906
00:47:58,805 --> 00:48:01,703
You don't have to know. Take off your clothes.

907
00:48:02,675 --> 00:48:03,767
Why?

908
00:48:05,945 --> 00:48:09,915
What? You want me to stay here pretending to be you?

909
00:48:09,916 --> 00:48:12,669
Don't you see all the fans and paparazzi outside?

910
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:16,251
I have something important today. Please help me.

911
00:48:17,126 --> 00:48:19,471
What? You don't want to?

912
00:48:20,226 --> 00:48:22,613
It's true I'm your stand-in,

913
00:48:23,095 --> 00:48:24,634
but I think it's too much...

914
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:26,880
Fine. Forget it.

915
00:48:27,965 --> 00:48:30,832
I'll ask the director to find another stand-in.

916
00:48:30,876 --> 00:48:32,028
Another stand-in?

917
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:34,574
Hold on. I'll do it.

918
00:48:34,575 --> 00:48:36,992
- I'll do it. - Now we're talking.

919
00:48:37,246 --> 00:48:39,745
Don't hide in the room. Stay on this sofa.

920
00:48:39,746 --> 00:48:40,969
I don't want anyone to get suspicious.

921
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:42,306
Thanks.

922
00:48:43,016 --> 00:48:44,310
Well...

923
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:48,326
I can't believe him.

924
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:52,696
He was known as Huam High's Volcano. He was a legend.

925
00:48:53,595 --> 00:48:55,840
- He was the leader of the band? - In addition...

926
00:48:55,996 --> 00:48:58,076
to being a great singer, he was so good-looking.

927
00:48:58,166 --> 00:49:01,194
There was no one who hadn't heard of Yun Seo Jun of Huam High School.

928
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,443
- Right, Soo Yeon? - That's right.

929
00:49:03,735 --> 00:49:06,534
So many of my friends followed him around.

930
00:49:06,535 --> 00:49:08,923
I guess he looks all right.

931
00:49:09,776 --> 00:49:12,223
But when it comes to looks, no one can beat Woo Shik.

932
00:49:12,776 --> 00:49:15,815
What? Yu Ri, what are you talking about?

933
00:49:15,816 --> 00:49:19,455
To me, you look way better than him.

934
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,085
Woo Shik is nothing compared to Seo Jun.

935
00:49:22,086 --> 00:49:25,155
Hey. That guy is handsome in an old-fashioned way.

936
00:49:25,226 --> 00:49:26,225
Sorry.

937
00:49:26,226 --> 00:49:28,995
Woo Shik looks better than him according to today's standards.

938
00:49:28,996 --> 00:49:31,594
Girls these days definitely prefer guys who look like Woo Shik.

939
00:49:31,595 --> 00:49:34,504
- No way. - Why don't we ask other people?

940
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:36,034
The winner gets 100 dollars, deal?

941
00:49:36,035 --> 00:49:38,004
- 100 dollars? Deal. - Deal.

942
00:49:38,005 --> 00:49:39,198
Yu Ri, we need to talk.

943
00:49:41,175 --> 00:49:42,267
What's wrong?

944
00:49:42,305 --> 00:49:43,805
What are you doing?

945
00:49:44,016 --> 00:49:45,344
Why would you make such a bet?

946
00:49:45,345 --> 00:49:48,885
Brother, I'm doing this for your sake.

947
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:50,271
- Stay quiet. - What?

948
00:49:50,385 --> 00:49:51,984
What are you talking about?

949
00:49:51,985 --> 00:49:53,648
It seems like that guy...

950
00:49:53,785 --> 00:49:55,794
is still interested in Soo Yeon.

951
00:49:55,885 --> 00:49:58,069
What if Soo Yeon falls for him again?

952
00:49:58,155 --> 00:49:59,960
Do you want to lose her to him again?

953
00:50:00,296 --> 00:50:01,964
What am I supposed to do?

954
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:04,893
Listen. "Cha Woo Shik is handsome."

955
00:50:04,896 --> 00:50:08,170
"Cha Woo Shik looks way better than Yun Seo Jun."

956
00:50:08,566 --> 00:50:11,534
You have to make Soo Yeon realize that.

957
00:50:11,706 --> 00:50:15,377
That way, Soo Yeon might start taking an interest in you.

958
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:18,114
- Do you think so? - Of course.

959
00:50:19,976 --> 00:50:22,128
What kind of girl would say no to good-looking guys?

960
00:50:23,285 --> 00:50:25,499
I guess I do look pretty elegant.

961
00:50:26,215 --> 00:50:27,481
I have such glamour.

962
00:50:30,285 --> 00:50:32,090
Of course. You're my brother.

963
00:50:32,526 --> 00:50:34,260
Hey, mark my words.

964
00:50:34,425 --> 00:50:36,945
You're definitely going to win.

965
00:50:37,766 --> 00:50:40,244
- Trust me. - Okay.

966
00:50:40,766 --> 00:50:43,504
It's time to find out who is more handsome...

967
00:50:43,505 --> 00:50:45,648
between Woo Shik and Seo Jun.

968
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:47,438
Let's count the votes.

969
00:50:51,816 --> 00:50:54,468
You're definitely going to win.

970
00:50:54,746 --> 00:50:55,969
Trust me.

971
00:51:04,755 --> 00:51:06,125
(Cha Woo Shik)

972
00:51:06,126 --> 00:51:08,717
Cha Woo Shik. Okay! See?

973
00:51:09,526 --> 00:51:12,234
- I told you he looks better. - Stop it.

974
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,490
You're embarrassing me.

975
00:51:14,266 --> 00:51:16,274
Gosh, this is impossible.

976
00:51:18,005 --> 00:51:19,158
Next.

977
00:51:22,376 --> 00:51:23,426
Yun Seo Jun.

978
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:27,621
It's a tie. Neck and neck.

979
00:51:27,816 --> 00:51:28,906
I knew it.

980
00:51:29,945 --> 00:51:31,554
(Cha Woo Shik, Yun Seo Jun)

981
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:32,636
Yun Seo Jun.

982
00:51:34,255 --> 00:51:35,378
Yun Seo Jun.

983
00:51:36,356 --> 00:51:38,335
Yun Seo Jun. Yun Seo Jun.

984
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,718
Yun Seo Jun. Yun Seo Jun.

985
00:51:43,396 --> 00:51:44,416
(Yun Seo Jun)

986
00:51:44,896 --> 00:51:46,018
Yun Seo Jun.

987
00:51:49,936 --> 00:51:51,231
(Cha Woo Shik, Yun Seo Jun)

988
00:51:52,206 --> 00:51:53,399
14 to 1?

989
00:51:54,675 --> 00:51:56,904
I don't believe it. How can this be possible?

990
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:59,628
What did I say? Woo Shik can't even compare.

991
00:52:00,615 --> 00:52:03,645
By the way, who voted for Woo Shik?

992
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:05,548
That person has different standards from all the other people.

993
00:52:06,655 --> 00:52:08,654
Did you vote for him?

994
00:52:08,655 --> 00:52:11,246
No. I'm the judge, so I didn't vote.

995
00:52:11,425 --> 00:52:12,618
Then who is it?

996
00:52:12,695 --> 00:52:14,093
Who voted for Woo Shik?

997
00:52:14,425 --> 00:52:15,548
Mr. Cha.

998
00:52:16,226 --> 00:52:17,317
Mr. Cha.

999
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:19,431
No one?

1000
00:52:19,896 --> 00:52:22,619
Who wrote, "Cha Woo Shik", in red?

1001
00:52:23,305 --> 00:52:26,162
- "Cha Woo Shik". - Who thinks the same as I do?

1002
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:27,326
What's going on?

1003
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:31,515
No way. Woo Shik, did you vote for yourself?

1004
00:52:31,516 --> 00:52:34,239
I didn't. What do you take me for?

1005
00:52:51,996 --> 00:52:53,158
Woo Shik.

1006
00:52:54,266 --> 00:52:56,784
You voted for yourself?

1007
00:52:57,166 --> 00:52:58,869
You're shameless.

1008
00:53:00,476 --> 00:53:03,199
I can't believe this. I didn't see this coming.

1009
00:53:04,146 --> 00:53:05,236
I can't accept this.

1010
00:53:05,776 --> 00:53:07,071
Give me 100 dollars.

1011
00:53:08,316 --> 00:53:11,141
Look carefully. Does he really look that bad?

1012
00:53:11,356 --> 00:53:12,585
Doesn't he look like Park Bo Gum?

1013
00:53:12,586 --> 00:53:15,033
You might even mistake him for Gong Yoo's twin brother.

1014
00:53:15,155 --> 00:53:17,910
Look. At least for a split second.

1015
00:53:18,026 --> 00:53:20,864
- Right? - Hey! Please stop.

1016
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:22,424
- Brother! - Darn!

1017
00:53:22,425 --> 00:53:24,638
- Brother! - Woo Shik.

1018
00:53:25,166 --> 00:53:26,624
Take your paper.

1019
00:53:31,735 --> 00:53:33,846
How long do I have to stay here?

1020
00:53:37,376 --> 00:53:40,129
Did you have to...

1021
00:53:40,276 --> 00:53:42,632
- That's our movie. - provoke me like that?

1022
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:44,713
When did they shoot that?

1023
00:53:45,456 --> 00:53:46,679
Did they shoot me too?

1024
00:53:46,755 --> 00:53:50,428
I'm with Yu Min, the most popular actor right now.

1025
00:53:50,485 --> 00:53:54,097
You're shooting an action movie. How is it going?

1026
00:53:54,226 --> 00:53:56,266
Well, I'm definitely not good enough.

1027
00:53:56,726 --> 00:53:59,520
I just hope I'm not causing the cast and crew any trouble.

1028
00:53:59,965 --> 00:54:02,034
Isn't it hard to shoot action scenes?

1029
00:54:02,035 --> 00:54:03,404
- It is. - It is.

1030
00:54:03,405 --> 00:54:05,170
It's very hard and exhausting.

1031
00:54:06,235 --> 00:54:08,504
But I'm doing all action scenes myself.

1032
00:54:08,505 --> 00:54:09,933
I could use a stand-in,

1033
00:54:10,005 --> 00:54:12,728
but I want to be respectful to my fans.

1034
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:16,779
- That's amazing. - Don't say that. I'm an actor.

1035
00:54:16,816 --> 00:54:18,651
I'm actually a huge fan of yours.

1036
00:54:19,115 --> 00:54:21,532
Thank you.

1037
00:54:22,385 --> 00:54:24,700
- Hello. - Is everything all right?

1038
00:54:25,226 --> 00:54:27,979
Yes, I guess.

1039
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,234
Honey, what are you doing? Who are you talking to?

1040
00:54:31,235 --> 00:54:32,358
The guy I told you about earlier.

1041
00:54:33,066 --> 00:54:35,411
Oh, the puppet that's standing in for you at your place?

1042
00:54:35,666 --> 00:54:37,572
What are you talking about? I didn't say that.

1043
00:54:37,635 --> 00:54:39,135
"Puppet"?

1044
00:54:39,535 --> 00:54:41,821
I'll be back soon. Hang in there.

1045
00:54:42,276 --> 00:54:43,735
Wait...

1046
00:54:48,615 --> 00:54:51,032
What? "Puppet"?

1047
00:54:52,086 --> 00:54:53,208
Yu Min.

1048
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:56,842
Did you take me for a pushover?

1049
00:54:59,903 --> 00:55:01,840
Thanks to Yu Ri, we're going to stuff ourselves today.

1050
00:55:02,773 --> 00:55:05,002
Yu Ri, thank you so much for the meal.

1051
00:55:05,003 --> 00:55:06,501
Woo Shik, thanks for being ugly.

1052
00:55:08,343 --> 00:55:09,873
Shut up and just eat.

1053
00:55:10,983 --> 00:55:12,033
I'm sorry, Yu Ri.

1054
00:55:13,782 --> 00:55:17,047
Wait, I think I ruined the mood a little bit.

1055
00:55:17,352 --> 00:55:18,551
Do you want to see something fun?

1056
00:55:18,552 --> 00:55:19,572
What is it?

1057
00:55:20,082 --> 00:55:21,143
Okay.

1058
00:55:23,852 --> 00:55:25,046
Watch carefully.

1059
00:55:26,293 --> 00:55:27,344
What is it?

1060
00:55:29,363 --> 00:55:31,101
There's nothing on this tissue, right?

1061
00:55:31,102 --> 00:55:32,101
Right.

1062
00:55:32,102 --> 00:55:34,684
I'll cover this glass with this tissue.

1063
00:55:44,983 --> 00:55:46,112
What do you think has happened?

1064
00:55:46,113 --> 00:55:47,510
I think the coin might have disappeared.

1065
00:55:47,713 --> 00:55:49,141
All right, watch carefully.

1066
00:55:54,222 --> 00:55:56,059
Nothing happened.

1067
00:55:57,923 --> 00:55:59,146
Soo Yeon, give me your hand.

1068
00:56:00,063 --> 00:56:01,154
My hand?

1069
00:56:06,133 --> 00:56:08,622
Abracadabra.

1070
00:56:09,503 --> 00:56:11,787
Now, I will lower her hand.

1071
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:18,741
- What? - That's amazing!

1072
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:21,351
Hey, the glass disappeared! Guys, did you see that?

1073
00:56:21,352 --> 00:56:22,914
Woo Shik, the glass disappeared!

1074
00:56:24,753 --> 00:56:26,149
Do you call that a trick?

1075
00:56:27,122 --> 00:56:29,601
When it comes to tricks, there's no match for Woo Shik.

1076
00:56:29,923 --> 00:56:31,062
What are you talking about?

1077
00:56:31,063 --> 00:56:33,391
What? You know some tricks too.

1078
00:56:33,392 --> 00:56:34,963
Something even more fascinating than that.

1079
00:56:35,093 --> 00:56:38,261
Woo Shik does? Come on, he doesn't know how to do anything.

1080
00:56:38,262 --> 00:56:40,732
Are you disrespecting my brother right now?

1081
00:56:40,733 --> 00:56:42,263
- Yes. - Do you want to bet on it?

1082
00:56:42,302 --> 00:56:44,371
How about 200 dollars this time?

1083
00:56:44,372 --> 00:56:46,301
200 dollars? Okay, deal!

1084
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:47,495
Yu Ri, we need to talk.

1085
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:51,812
- What is it? - What's gotten into you?

1086
00:56:51,813 --> 00:56:53,954
You have to make up for the loss.

1087
00:56:54,113 --> 00:56:57,351
Did you see Soo Yeon's face light up from that magic trick?

1088
00:56:57,352 --> 00:56:58,882
What do you expect me to do then?

1089
00:56:58,883 --> 00:57:00,483
Isn't it obvious?

1090
00:57:00,682 --> 00:57:02,422
Prove that you know how to lift up the mood and entertain people.

1091
00:57:02,423 --> 00:57:04,761
Show her that you can do something that's more amazing...

1092
00:57:04,762 --> 00:57:06,700
than what that Seo Jun guy can do.

1093
00:57:06,963 --> 00:57:08,761
You have to prove yourself.

1094
00:57:08,762 --> 00:57:11,031
What is this? Some kind of childish contest?

1095
00:57:11,032 --> 00:57:12,123
Childish?

1096
00:57:13,302 --> 00:57:15,002
Fine, don't do it.

1097
00:57:15,003 --> 00:57:18,512
I won't care if he takes away the girl you like from now on.

1098
00:57:18,903 --> 00:57:20,708
Suit yourself, you stupid jerk.

1099
00:57:24,412 --> 00:57:26,932
There is one thing that I'm good at.

1100
00:57:42,662 --> 00:57:43,714
My gosh.

1101
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:48,006
- Woo Shik. - Stop.

1102
00:57:48,273 --> 00:57:49,394
What's wrong?

1103
00:57:49,472 --> 00:57:50,553
Can't you see?

1104
00:57:51,202 --> 00:57:52,773
You totally ruined the mood.

1105
00:57:53,642 --> 00:57:55,039
This is looking bad.

1106
00:57:55,313 --> 00:57:56,802
Now we need a game changer.

1107
00:57:56,972 --> 00:57:58,442
What game changer?

1108
00:57:58,443 --> 00:57:59,533
Just stay still.

1109
00:58:00,213 --> 00:58:01,609
I'll take care of this.

1110
00:58:03,113 --> 00:58:04,235
Trust me.

1111
00:58:04,313 --> 00:58:05,373
What...

1112
00:58:08,793 --> 00:58:13,006
All right. That was just a warm up. Get ready for the real show.

1113
00:58:13,193 --> 00:58:15,508
Woo Shik, attention.

1114
00:58:18,832 --> 00:58:21,076
Be prepared, everyone.

1115
00:58:21,173 --> 00:58:22,223
Here we go!

1116
00:58:40,122 --> 00:58:41,522
What are you doing?

1117
00:58:41,523 --> 00:58:43,766
What? I did what I had to do in order to win.

1118
00:58:44,323 --> 00:58:45,384
Woo Shik.

1119
00:58:47,762 --> 00:58:48,962
You're the winner.

1120
00:58:48,963 --> 00:58:50,013
What is...

1121
00:58:50,432 --> 00:58:53,301
What's the point of winning like this?

1122
00:58:53,302 --> 00:58:54,322
Why?

1123
00:58:58,173 --> 00:59:00,008
You're driving me crazy.

1124
00:59:00,372 --> 00:59:02,484
Goodness. Darn it!

1125
00:59:03,972 --> 00:59:06,838
Woo Shik, where are you going? You're the winner.

1126
00:59:07,412 --> 00:59:09,212
- You win! - He didn't win.

1127
00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:11,089
He went out, so it's a forfeit.

1128
00:59:11,222 --> 00:59:12,752
Yes! I got money again.

1129
00:59:17,093 --> 00:59:18,113
Hey, Jun Ki.

1130
00:59:18,363 --> 00:59:20,607
This place is nice.

1131
00:59:23,932 --> 00:59:24,962
Jun Ki.

1132
00:59:24,963 --> 00:59:26,831
Hey, Ki Bong. You're here.

1133
00:59:26,832 --> 00:59:28,872
So, this is Yu Min's home.

1134
00:59:29,102 --> 00:59:31,244
- What are you doing here? - That's none of your business.

1135
00:59:31,273 --> 00:59:33,201
What about the things I asked for? Are they in here?

1136
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:35,253
Yes. But why did you ask me to borrow these?

1137
00:59:35,543 --> 00:59:36,899
And what's Ichiro's autographed bat for?

1138
00:59:38,043 --> 00:59:39,674
You'll find out soon.

1139
00:59:40,813 --> 00:59:43,200
Then shall we get started?

1140
00:59:44,313 --> 00:59:46,621
Hey, what do we have to do now?

1141
00:59:46,622 --> 00:59:48,254
What do you think?

1142
00:59:48,323 --> 00:59:50,621
Let's have a blast, okay?

1143
00:59:50,622 --> 00:59:52,522
A blast? How?

1144
00:59:52,523 --> 00:59:53,543
How?

1145
00:59:53,963 --> 00:59:55,320
Like this.

1146
00:59:55,593 --> 00:59:56,831
- Like this. - Don't hit me.

1147
00:59:56,832 --> 00:59:58,261
You're dead.

1148
01:00:05,443 --> 01:00:06,829
What is going on in there?

1149
01:00:07,702 --> 01:00:09,312
- What are they doing? - My gosh.

1150
01:00:09,313 --> 01:00:12,474
- Stop taking pictures. - I can't see. Move!

1153

1155
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:19,322
Gosh, it's so fast.

1156
01:00:19,323 --> 01:00:20,475
The articles are already online.

1157
01:00:21,122 --> 01:00:22,851
Hey, will you be okay with this?

1158
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:25,779
Don't worry. I can handle it.

1159
01:00:27,722 --> 01:00:29,191
It's Yu Min.

1160
01:00:31,262 --> 01:00:34,902
Gosh, I wonder why the top star Yu Min is calling me.

1161
01:00:34,903 --> 01:00:37,931
Hey. What are these articles?

1162
01:00:38,142 --> 01:00:40,141
What did you do inside my house?

1163
01:00:40,142 --> 01:00:41,511
What? What did I do?

1164
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:42,635
Are you kidding me?

1165
01:00:42,843 --> 01:00:44,505
Explain that it wasn't me.

1166
01:00:44,813 --> 01:00:47,741
Explain that you were there today as my stand-in!

1167
01:00:47,742 --> 01:00:49,078
What do you mean, a stand-in?

1168
01:00:49,253 --> 01:00:50,252
Come on.

1169
01:00:50,253 --> 01:00:52,851
Didn't you say that wasn't the right way to be respectful to your fans...

1170
01:00:52,852 --> 01:00:55,269
and you did everything yourself?

1171
01:00:56,193 --> 01:00:57,579
- What? - Hey.

1172
01:00:58,262 --> 01:00:59,415
You're rich,

1173
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:01,787
popular,

1174
01:01:02,563 --> 01:01:04,571
and you even have a girlfriend.

1175
01:01:05,563 --> 01:01:06,857
Did you...

1176
01:01:07,733 --> 01:01:11,271
really have to take all the credit for what we, stand-in actors,

1177
01:01:12,202 --> 01:01:13,971
did for you?

1178
01:01:13,972 --> 01:01:15,672
- What? - Hey.

1179
01:01:15,673 --> 01:01:17,039
You just wait and see.

1180
01:01:17,613 --> 01:01:19,520
I'll become a famous actor...

1181
01:01:19,613 --> 01:01:22,816
and make you become my stand-in. Do you understand?

1182
01:01:23,582 --> 01:01:26,652
It's going to happen soon, so you just wait and see, you jerk.

1183
01:01:26,653 --> 01:01:27,673
I'm hanging up!

1184
01:01:27,952 --> 01:01:29,044
Good job.

1185
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:33,783
Great job.

1186
01:01:35,063 --> 01:01:36,561
I feel so happy.

1187
01:01:40,302 --> 01:01:41,935
This is all because of Yu Ri.

1188
01:01:42,552 --> 01:01:44,664
I totally humiliated myself in front of Soo Yeon.

1189
01:01:47,922 --> 01:01:49,290
What are you doing here?

1190
01:01:50,223 --> 01:01:51,355
Soo Yeon.

1191
01:01:56,502 --> 01:01:57,828
Why are you here?

1192
01:01:57,933 --> 01:01:59,973
You didn't return, so I came looking for you.

1193
01:02:00,672 --> 01:02:04,477
Gosh, why did you go overboard so much? It was embarrassing.

1194
01:02:07,373 --> 01:02:09,178
I know it was embarrassing.

1195
01:02:09,482 --> 01:02:11,318
You met your first love in 10 years.

1196
01:02:11,712 --> 01:02:14,467
And I acted like a total fool in front of everyone.

1197
01:02:14,982 --> 01:02:16,554
How embarrassed would you have been?

1198
01:02:16,623 --> 01:02:19,821
What? My first love? Who?

1199
01:02:19,822 --> 01:02:21,117
I know everything.

1200
01:02:21,692 --> 01:02:23,630
Seo Jun is your first love.

1201
01:02:23,822 --> 01:02:26,383
That's why you came by the practice room all the time.

1202
01:02:26,393 --> 01:02:28,096
What are you talking about?

1203
01:02:28,532 --> 01:02:30,471
He's not my first love.

1204
01:02:30,632 --> 01:02:33,631
Liar. I didn't even know that...

1205
01:02:33,933 --> 01:02:36,320
and wanted to sing the song that you liked.

1206
01:02:36,572 --> 01:02:38,377
So I held the guitar all night...

1207
01:02:38,973 --> 01:02:41,462
and practiced until my fingers bled.

1208
01:02:42,712 --> 01:02:43,732
Forget it.

1209
01:02:44,513 --> 01:02:46,695
I was stupid for being mistaken.

1210
01:02:51,023 --> 01:02:52,277
You weren't mistaken.

1211
01:02:53,793 --> 01:02:54,813
What?

1212
01:02:56,293 --> 01:02:57,893
I said, you weren't mistaken.

1213
01:03:01,563 --> 01:03:03,265
How could a guy like you be my first love?

1214
01:03:05,103 --> 01:03:07,785
What? What do you mean?

1215
01:03:08,873 --> 01:03:10,841
You were my first love.

1216
01:03:11,172 --> 01:03:13,253
Cha Woo Shik, you were my first love.

1217
01:03:13,273 --> 01:03:14,812
You said I wasn't yesterday.

1218
01:03:15,143 --> 01:03:17,356
You said your first love was someone else.

1219
01:03:18,853 --> 01:03:22,218
How could I admit that when you were right in front of me?

1220
01:03:23,523 --> 01:03:26,277
Do you remember that day when we met in the practice room?

1221
01:03:27,652 --> 01:03:28,683
That...

1222
01:03:29,493 --> 01:03:30,788
wasn't a coincidence.

1223
01:04:02,592 --> 01:04:04,980
- What are you doing here? - You startled me.

1224
01:04:06,163 --> 01:04:08,713
- Hey, Soo Yeon. - Did I startle you?

1225
01:04:09,232 --> 01:04:11,518
I heard someone playing the guitar as I was passing by.

1226
01:04:17,842 --> 01:04:18,964
Are you serious?

1227
01:04:20,172 --> 01:04:22,936
Then what about the thing that happened on the day of our concert?

1228
01:04:23,942 --> 01:04:25,051
"The thing"? What do you mean?

1229
01:04:25,052 --> 01:04:27,358
In the green room on the day of our concert,

1230
01:04:28,052 --> 01:04:29,379
you and Seo Jun...

1231
01:04:30,882 --> 01:04:32,251
I saw you guys kissing.

1232
01:04:32,252 --> 01:04:34,088
What? What are you talking about? We kissed?

1233
01:04:37,862 --> 01:04:40,239
Hey, that's not what happened.

1234
01:04:50,302 --> 01:04:53,542
Hey, Soo Yeon. The concert isn't starting until later.

1235
01:04:53,543 --> 01:04:54,695
Why are you so early?

1236
01:04:55,743 --> 01:04:56,834
Just because.

1237
01:04:57,112 --> 01:04:58,509
By the way, where's Woo Shik?

1238
01:04:58,583 --> 01:04:59,940
Not sure. He'll be here soon though.

1239
01:05:03,282 --> 01:05:06,455
- Thanks for this. - Oh, that's not...

1240
01:05:17,333 --> 01:05:18,631
What are you doing?

1241
01:05:18,632 --> 01:05:20,001
Soo Yeon, what's wrong?

1242
01:05:20,002 --> 01:05:21,195
Are you out of your mind?

1243
01:05:21,402 --> 01:05:22,972
What was that about, out of the blue?

1244
01:05:22,973 --> 01:05:24,738
I thought you had a crush on me.

1245
01:05:25,842 --> 01:05:28,259
What? No, I don't!

1246
01:05:28,982 --> 01:05:30,135
Give me back the flowers.

1247
01:05:33,683 --> 01:05:35,967
Cha Woo Shik, you fool.

1248
01:05:36,453 --> 01:05:39,145
I actually have feelings for you.

1249
01:05:39,993 --> 01:05:42,778
I was waiting for you to tell me but have decided to beat you to it.

1250
01:05:43,422 --> 01:05:45,371
Good luck with the concert today. You got this!

1251
01:05:49,902 --> 01:05:51,055
Are you serious?

1252
01:05:51,132 --> 01:05:53,652
Then you should've told me.

1253
01:05:53,732 --> 01:05:55,476
How was I supposed to tell you?

1254
01:05:55,802 --> 01:05:57,914
Did you ever talk to me after that day?

1255
01:05:58,143 --> 01:06:00,458
You avoided me, and you even ignored all my calls.

1256
01:06:04,282 --> 01:06:05,404
Hang on.

1257
01:06:05,813 --> 01:06:09,453
So you've been prickly with me and mean to me...

1258
01:06:09,523 --> 01:06:10,880
because of that incident?

1259
01:06:10,953 --> 01:06:12,451
No, don't get the wrong idea.

1260
01:06:14,752 --> 01:06:18,088
Right, I know you're a loser, but you can't be that lame.

1261
01:06:21,763 --> 01:06:24,353
It's chilly. Let's get back, okay?

1262
01:06:24,632 --> 01:06:27,253
What? Oh, you go ahead.

1263
01:06:27,533 --> 01:06:28,798
I'll get back in a few minutes.

1264
01:06:29,542 --> 01:06:31,409
All right, don't stay out too late.

1265
01:06:41,513 --> 01:06:42,676
Darn it!

1266
01:06:43,382 --> 01:06:45,126
So I was Soo Yeon's first love after all?

1267
01:06:45,723 --> 01:06:48,620
I had no idea and resented her for the past 10 years?

1268
01:06:49,162 --> 01:06:52,701
What an idiot! I'm such an idiot. I can't believe this.

1269
01:06:58,632 --> 01:06:59,928
This is crazy.

1270
01:07:03,773 --> 01:07:06,903
I'm so dumb. What a stupid idiot!

1271
01:07:14,513 --> 01:07:16,970
(Welcome to Waikiki 2 / Eulachacha Waikiki 2)

1272
01:07:17,922 --> 01:07:20,251
She told me that I was her first love.

1273
01:07:20,252 --> 01:07:22,421
Woo Shik, are you seeing someone by any chance?

1274
01:07:22,422 --> 01:07:24,892
- Hey, are you going to date her? - I'm convinced...

1275
01:07:24,893 --> 01:07:26,661
that Soo Yeon has feelings for me, like you said.

1276
01:07:26,662 --> 01:07:29,315
- You want me to sell you my dream? - Nothing's been going my way.

1277
01:07:30,563 --> 01:07:33,072
So you'll stay here until tomorrow and not even go to the bathroom?

1278
01:07:33,073 --> 01:07:36,164
I got called in for an audition for a movie that I really wanted to do.

1279
01:07:36,242 --> 01:07:38,341
- I bought the dream back. - Let's go!

1280
01:07:38,342 --> 01:07:39,972
- Good luck today, Ki Bong. - Thank you. You too.

1281
01:07:39,973 --> 01:07:41,272
Good luck today, Ki Bong.

1282
01:07:41,273 --> 01:07:42,282
Don't be surprised.

1283
01:07:42,283 --> 01:07:44,527
I have to do everything four times.

1284
01:07:44,683 --> 01:07:46,282
Ha Ni is on my team?

1285
01:07:46,283 --> 01:07:48,118
I must finish this with this throw.

1286
01:07:48,353 --> 01:07:50,800
- No matter what! - Come on, throw it.
