1
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,585
It's time for the last question.

2
00:00:12,586 --> 00:00:14,745
In the story of Hong Gil Dong, what is...

3
00:00:14,746 --> 00:00:19,112
the organization that he made in order to provide aid to the poor?

4
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:21,386
What was that? I knew what it was.

5
00:00:21,387 --> 00:00:23,226
I know. I think I know this too.

6
00:00:23,227 --> 00:00:26,388
An organization made to provide aid to the poor?

7
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,462
- UNICEF! - What?

8
00:00:29,236 --> 00:00:30,235
What?

9
00:00:30,236 --> 00:00:32,654
How could Hong Gil Dong make UNICEF, you idiot?

10
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:37,835
Hey, don't even think of answering and just listen quietly, okay?

11
00:00:37,836 --> 00:00:40,806
It's a tough question. You're treating me like a total fool.

12
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:41,897
The answer is...

13
00:00:42,116 --> 00:00:43,645
Hwal Bin Dang.

14
00:00:43,646 --> 00:00:44,738
You are correct!

15
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:48,045
The 11th Quiz King has finally been decided!

16
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:51,356
Kim Yeong Ja has won a prize of 40,000 dollars.

17
00:00:51,357 --> 00:00:52,581
40,000 dollars?

18
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:53,926
- Hey. - Thank you.

19
00:00:53,927 --> 00:00:55,755
The prize is 40,000 dollars?

20
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:56,847
You didn't know?

21
00:00:56,997 --> 00:00:59,865
That's why everyone's trying so hard to appear on that quiz show lately.

22
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:00,989
Really?

23
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:03,326
Is that so?

24
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:06,197
It's time for Soo Yeon's program.

25
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,344
- Hey, isn't that you? - Hello, mister.

26
00:01:10,676 --> 00:01:12,175
No, no.

27
00:01:12,176 --> 00:01:13,446
- Jaywalking is... - What is that?

28
00:01:13,447 --> 00:01:15,946
bad for children.

29
00:01:15,947 --> 00:01:18,916
When you cross the road, you must stand at the crosswalk...

30
00:01:18,917 --> 00:01:20,616
and look left and right.

31
00:01:20,617 --> 00:01:22,860
Raise your right hand up high...

32
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,256
Jun Ki.

33
00:01:24,257 --> 00:01:25,817
What on earth is that?

34
00:01:30,027 --> 00:01:31,526
That's so hilarious.

35
00:01:32,766 --> 00:01:34,736
What is that? "The Nice Man"?

36
00:01:34,796 --> 00:01:35,866
When did you star on that?

37
00:01:35,867 --> 00:01:37,162
It hasn't been long.

38
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:40,606
I wasn't being cast for anything, and I failed all my auditions.

39
00:01:40,607 --> 00:01:42,476
Your life is so pitiful too.

40
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,006
What's wrong with that? It's educational and nice.

41
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:46,607
- Right. - I guess.

42
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:48,961
Shall I go take a nap now?

43
00:01:49,147 --> 00:01:51,421
The Nice Man! Here, we go, Nice Man!

44
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:52,815
You jerk.

45
00:01:52,816 --> 00:01:53,836
Jun Ki.

46
00:01:54,316 --> 00:01:57,386
Swearing is bad. No, no, swearing is bad for kids.

47
00:01:57,387 --> 00:01:58,825
Nice kids shouldn't swear.

48
00:01:58,826 --> 00:02:00,356
- No, no. - I told you to stop.

49
00:02:00,357 --> 00:02:01,526
Stop it!

50
00:02:01,527 --> 00:02:03,825
Jun Ki. No, no.

51
00:02:03,826 --> 00:02:06,825
Nice kids shouldn't grab their friends by their collars like that.

52
00:02:06,867 --> 00:02:08,265
Come here. Get over here.

53
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:09,491
Get over here!

54
00:02:13,106 --> 00:02:16,707
(Grown-ups Just Don't Understand)

55
00:02:21,446 --> 00:02:22,804
Nice Man!

56
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,651
No, no.

57
00:02:24,747 --> 00:02:28,734
Nice kids shouldn't be picky with their food. No, no.

58
00:02:29,017 --> 00:02:31,885
Don't be picky when you eat food.

59
00:02:31,886 --> 00:02:33,895
You must eat a balanced diet.

60
00:02:34,057 --> 00:02:35,077
Okay?

61
00:02:38,327 --> 00:02:39,551
Here we go, Nice Man!

62
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,971
It's the Nice Man!

63
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:43,697
No, no.

64
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:47,405
Nice kids should sleep early and get up early too.

65
00:02:47,406 --> 00:02:49,753
- Okay? - Okay, Nice Man.

66
00:02:51,476 --> 00:02:53,792
To everyone watching "Fun For Kids TV", did you see?

67
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:57,646
I hope all of you become nice kids who always...

68
00:02:57,647 --> 00:03:00,216
behave nicely just like me, The Nice Man. Okay?

69
00:03:00,217 --> 00:03:02,563
I'll see you next time!

70
00:03:03,686 --> 00:03:04,808
Here we go, Nice Man!

71
00:03:06,557 --> 00:03:08,155
Cut. Okay, good job.

72
00:03:08,156 --> 00:03:10,675
- Good job. - Thank you.

73
00:03:11,096 --> 00:03:13,004
- Director, thank you. - Good job today.

74
00:03:13,267 --> 00:03:14,755
Jun Ki, take this.

75
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:16,796
What is this?

76
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:17,836
What do you think?

77
00:03:17,837 --> 00:03:20,366
They're fan letters and gifts from kids all over the country.

78
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,105
You're a total star these days.

79
00:03:22,106 --> 00:03:25,546
Come on. I'm just popular among young kids. I'm not a star.

80
00:03:25,547 --> 00:03:27,105
What are you talking about?

81
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,815
Do you know how many celebrities became stars through kid programs?

82
00:03:29,816 --> 00:03:32,016
Shin Sae Kyeong, Jang Seo Hee, Cho Yeo Jeong,

83
00:03:32,017 --> 00:03:33,385
Ki Tae Young, Kim Sung Su.

84
00:03:33,386 --> 00:03:34,712
It's countless.

85
00:03:35,057 --> 00:03:36,178
Really?

86
00:03:36,957 --> 00:03:37,977
A star?

87
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:40,285
("Fun For Kids TV")

88
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,193
How long has it been since I last got a present?

89
00:03:43,497 --> 00:03:45,537
What if I really become a star at this rate?

90
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,665
Oh, it's the Nice Man.

91
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:50,860
Here we go, Nice Man!

92
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:52,157
Hello.

93
00:03:52,606 --> 00:03:54,336
- Do you know me too? - Of course.

94
00:03:54,337 --> 00:03:57,176
You're the most popular person at our kindergarten!

95
00:03:57,177 --> 00:03:58,197
Really?

96
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:02,116
I'm literally like BTS among little kids.

97
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:05,345
Mister, can you sign your autograph on my backpack?

98
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:06,407
Autograph?

99
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:08,179
Of course I can.

100
00:04:08,786 --> 00:04:10,623
How long has it been since I last gave out an autograph?

101
00:04:11,886 --> 00:04:12,948
Come here.

102
00:04:13,626 --> 00:04:15,187
Let's see.

103
00:04:18,226 --> 00:04:22,636
Lee...

104
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,305
Lee...

105
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:32,518
Lee...

106
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:39,516
Jun...

107
00:04:39,517 --> 00:04:43,361
It's Ki...

108
00:04:43,457 --> 00:04:45,017
Ki. There you go.

109
00:04:46,257 --> 00:04:48,092
Thank you.

110
00:04:48,596 --> 00:04:49,852
You're welcome.

111
00:04:50,996 --> 00:04:53,475
It's time for the Nice Man to go now.

112
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:03,658
Here we go, Nice Man!

113
00:05:04,277 --> 00:05:06,076
- Okay, I know. - So these are...

114
00:05:06,077 --> 00:05:07,905
all letters from your fans?

115
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:09,201
Yes, I'm telling you.

116
00:05:09,546 --> 00:05:11,886
Not only are there fan letters, but if you look in here,

117
00:05:11,887 --> 00:05:15,008
there are cards, tops, and even slime that I could play with.

118
00:05:15,116 --> 00:05:16,616
It's full of so many presents.

119
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:18,859
I'm about to be a star now.

120
00:05:20,027 --> 00:05:22,595
Star, my foot. Stop overreacting.

121
00:05:22,596 --> 00:05:24,024
Don't believe me if you don't want to.

122
00:05:24,197 --> 00:05:25,288
Goodness.

123
00:05:27,296 --> 00:05:28,425
Oh, it's Soo Mi.

124
00:05:28,426 --> 00:05:29,457
Soo Mi?

125
00:05:29,637 --> 00:05:31,735
Oh, that girl from your blind date last time?

126
00:05:31,736 --> 00:05:34,136
A blind date? Did you go on a blind date?

127
00:05:34,137 --> 00:05:36,116
Yes. A friend of mine introduced me to her.

128
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:38,745
Soo Mi is so cute, sexy,

129
00:05:38,746 --> 00:05:41,459
pretty, and kind. She's my ideal type.

130
00:05:42,017 --> 00:05:43,175
Do you want to see her picture?

131
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,850
Forget it, enjoy it on your own.

132
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,793
Why is she giving me an attitude?

133
00:05:54,056 --> 00:05:56,035
Goodness, there she goes again.

134
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,165
We need to throw out that alphorn or smoking pipe, or whatever it is.

135
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,696
It's seriously so noisy.

136
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,092
Tell me about it.

137
00:06:02,937 --> 00:06:05,824
But why isn't "Challenge! King of Quiz" calling?

138
00:06:05,906 --> 00:06:07,978
- Was I disqualified? - "Challenge! King of Quiz"?

139
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:10,076
You really submitted an application?

140
00:06:10,077 --> 00:06:12,006
Yes. I'm going to win the prize money...

141
00:06:12,007 --> 00:06:13,506
and open Yu Ri's Kitchen 31.

142
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:14,598
Goodness me.

143
00:06:14,976 --> 00:06:18,316
Even if you're chosen, do you know how difficult the questions are?

144
00:06:18,317 --> 00:06:19,586
Do you take me for a fool?

145
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,545
Do you think I'm stupid like you?

146
00:06:21,546 --> 00:06:22,710
Stupid?

147
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,516
Who are you calling stupid?

148
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:25,547
You.

149
00:06:27,027 --> 00:06:28,454
I can't believe you.

150
00:06:30,897 --> 00:06:32,967
Hello? Yes, speaking.

151
00:06:34,296 --> 00:06:35,358
What?

152
00:06:35,837 --> 00:06:37,673
Yes. All right.

153
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,605
What was that about?

154
00:06:39,606 --> 00:06:40,766
It was the broadcasting station.

155
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,735
I was chosen to play in "Challenge! King of Quiz".

156
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:43,798
What?

157
00:06:44,077 --> 00:06:46,046
Really? Are you serious?

158
00:06:46,176 --> 00:06:48,105
Yes. This is strange.

159
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:49,646
I never submitted an application.

160
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:51,106
I did.

161
00:06:51,447 --> 00:06:53,716
If I did it alone, the chances would've been narrow,

162
00:06:53,717 --> 00:06:55,045
so I submitted all your names too.

163
00:06:55,046 --> 00:06:56,855
I really didn't know one of us would be chosen.

164
00:06:56,856 --> 00:06:58,655
This is amazing. It's unbelievable!

165
00:06:58,656 --> 00:07:01,614
Amazing? Do you think it's time for you to be happy?

166
00:07:01,656 --> 00:07:03,594
They chose Ki Bong.

167
00:07:03,796 --> 00:07:04,877
Do you not know Ki Bong?

168
00:07:05,056 --> 00:07:06,352
Oh, right.

169
00:07:06,897 --> 00:07:09,735
Darn! Why did it have to be this fool?

170
00:07:09,736 --> 00:07:12,663
What? So why did you submit the application in my name?

171
00:07:12,707 --> 00:07:14,235
Forget it, I'm not doing it.

172
00:07:14,236 --> 00:07:16,143
That choice isn't up to you.

173
00:07:16,277 --> 00:07:18,623
From now on, you and I are going to train hardcore.

174
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,845
- Put down your chopsticks. - I'm not doing it.

175
00:07:20,846 --> 00:07:22,345
- Put them down. - I'm not...

176
00:07:22,346 --> 00:07:23,675
- Hey, wait. - Put them down.

177
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:24,745
- That hurts. - Follow me.

178
00:07:24,746 --> 00:07:26,756
- I'm not doing it! - We don't have time.

179
00:07:29,957 --> 00:07:30,977
Ki Bong.

180
00:07:31,257 --> 00:07:33,985
I know I'm grasping at straws here,

181
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:36,852
but I'll try to teach you, so listen and stay alert.

182
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:37,876
Okay?

183
00:07:38,156 --> 00:07:39,247
Okay.

184
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:43,208
First of all, in order to warm up, let's start with an easy question.

185
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:47,006
"When couples share money for their dates..."

186
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:49,436
"or when people each pay for their food at work,"

187
00:07:49,437 --> 00:07:52,568
"what is this word called?"

188
00:07:52,976 --> 00:07:55,048
I know this word. What was it?

189
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,567
Dirty pay.

190
00:07:58,887 --> 00:08:00,186
What? Dirty pay?

191
00:08:00,187 --> 00:08:01,845
Instead of one cool guy paying for everything,

192
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:04,355
it's when everyone acts mean and dirty and pay individually.

193
00:08:04,356 --> 00:08:05,655
That's why it's called "Dirty pay".

194
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:08,716
It's "Dutch pay". How could it be dirty pay?

195
00:08:08,827 --> 00:08:11,071
How could you be so stupid?

196
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:13,248
Let's move on.

197
00:08:16,437 --> 00:08:19,936
"During a dispute, regardless of one's opinion,"

198
00:08:19,937 --> 00:08:22,035
"when someone makes abusive remarks about another person,"

199
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:24,280
"what is this word called?"

200
00:08:26,877 --> 00:08:28,641
It's a four-syllable word.

201
00:08:29,147 --> 00:08:31,360
It ends with "attack".

202
00:08:31,746 --> 00:08:32,868
Attack?

203
00:08:34,717 --> 00:08:35,777
Pregnancy attack!

204
00:08:36,787 --> 00:08:38,186
What? Pregnancy attack?

205
00:08:38,187 --> 00:08:40,985
Yes. There's no attack as cowardly and cheap as...

206
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:42,755
attacking a pregnant woman.

207
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,695
That's why it's called "pregnancy attack".

208
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,095
Why am I trying to teach you?

209
00:08:48,096 --> 00:08:50,735
I'd rather participate in the Olympics...

210
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:52,573
and win a gold medal.

211
00:08:52,606 --> 00:08:53,994
That might be faster.

212
00:08:54,106 --> 00:08:55,157
Shut it.

213
00:08:56,276 --> 00:08:57,398
Hello.

214
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,105
Hello. Hello, everyone.

215
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:00,145
Hello.

216
00:09:00,146 --> 00:09:01,575
Director, hello.

217
00:09:02,116 --> 00:09:04,446
Jun Ki, what were you thinking?

218
00:09:04,447 --> 00:09:06,216
- What? - Because of you,

219
00:09:06,217 --> 00:09:08,286
our website is being bombarded with complaints.

220
00:09:08,287 --> 00:09:09,556
Complaints?

221
00:09:09,557 --> 00:09:10,985
When you crossed the road yesterday,

222
00:09:10,986 --> 00:09:13,200
you didn't raise your hand or look left and right.

223
00:09:13,756 --> 00:09:16,025
A kid who watches our program saw you.

224
00:09:16,026 --> 00:09:18,326
He even posted a complaint saying he won't watch our show.

225
00:09:18,327 --> 00:09:19,326
Really?

226
00:09:19,327 --> 00:09:21,926
Don't you know kids all over the country watch our show?

227
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:24,620
You should watch your behavior no matter what you do from now on.

228
00:09:24,736 --> 00:09:26,133
This is so frustrating.

229
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:27,888
I'm sorry, sir.

230
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:32,012
Who was the kid who saw me?

231
00:09:32,577 --> 00:09:35,401
What do you think? Isn't the interior design so refined?

232
00:09:35,746 --> 00:09:36,797
Yes.

233
00:09:37,146 --> 00:09:38,370
It is, but...

234
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:40,879
how long do we have to do this?

235
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:44,716
It's time for the next question.

236
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,236
Yu Ri, how long are you going to do this?

237
00:09:47,557 --> 00:09:50,855
- Don't you see me working? - It's because we don't have time.

238
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:52,696
Also, I never told you not to work.

239
00:09:52,697 --> 00:09:55,175
Just keep studying whenever you have a moment while working.

240
00:09:55,297 --> 00:09:56,387
Here's a question.

241
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,066
"What are the three elements of a nation?"

242
00:09:58,496 --> 00:09:59,731
The three elements of a nation?

243
00:10:01,307 --> 00:10:03,417
Land, water, and wind?

244
00:10:03,707 --> 00:10:05,441
Land, water, and wind, my foot.

245
00:10:05,746 --> 00:10:08,153
- Is this about "Captain Planet"? - I know, right?

246
00:10:08,506 --> 00:10:10,148
I know what the three elements are.

247
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,766
Rocks, wind, and women.

248
00:10:14,317 --> 00:10:15,949
I beg your pardon?

249
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,584
Those are what Jeju Island is known for.

250
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:22,683
It's called "Samdado" because it has plenty of the three.

251
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:23,950
I see, "Samdado".

252
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:28,083
That's why the sashimi place in my area is called "Jeju Samdado".

253
00:10:28,197 --> 00:10:30,966
- Is that restaurant good? - Their food is amazing.

254
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:32,119
Really?

255
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:33,941
Then please send me their address.

256
00:10:35,337 --> 00:10:37,009
If you throw in an option...

257
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,867
How was it? Did you like the steak?

258
00:10:43,246 --> 00:10:44,776
Yes, it was good.

259
00:10:45,516 --> 00:10:48,506
By the way, why is it that I rarely get to see you these days?

260
00:10:48,746 --> 00:10:51,485
It's just that I've been very busy with the shoots.

261
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:53,119
I couldn't really make time.

262
00:10:53,827 --> 00:10:56,039
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

263
00:10:56,396 --> 00:10:57,926
It's because of work, so I understand.

264
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,804
You have a heart of gold.

265
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:03,729
That's the Nice Man! Wow.

266
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:07,265
Mom, that's the Nice Man.

267
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:08,460
Hi.

268
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,101
Here we go, Nice Man!

269
00:11:12,207 --> 00:11:15,919
Oh, why didn't you finish your food?

270
00:11:15,947 --> 00:11:17,546
You said that nice kids...

271
00:11:17,547 --> 00:11:20,545
should always eat everything on their plates.

272
00:11:21,986 --> 00:11:25,801
This? This is parsley. It's just for decoration.

273
00:11:26,026 --> 00:11:27,180
It's not meant to be eaten.

274
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,917
Still, you told us to eat everything on our plates.

275
00:11:30,996 --> 00:11:33,444
- The Nice Man shouldn't do this. - What?

276
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:36,019
Okay, all right.

277
00:11:36,837 --> 00:11:39,284
I'll eat it. I'll eat this, okay?

278
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,637
It's good. It's delicious.

279
00:11:45,677 --> 00:11:48,094
Why aren't you eating yours?

280
00:11:48,246 --> 00:11:49,399
I have to eat it too?

281
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:54,801
Soo Mi, I'm sorry,

282
00:11:55,187 --> 00:11:56,543
but could you please eat it?

283
00:11:57,157 --> 00:11:58,820
Do it for me, please?

284
00:12:13,707 --> 00:12:15,064
Here we go, Nice Man!

285
00:12:17,976 --> 00:12:20,393
That must've been uncomfortable for you.

286
00:12:21,106 --> 00:12:24,543
Unexpected things can happen because kids recognize me everywhere I go.

287
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:26,038
It's all right.

288
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:28,988
Thanks for walking me home.

289
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,222
- I'll head in, then. - Okay.

290
00:12:32,016 --> 00:12:33,148
Wait, Soo Mi.

291
00:12:33,756 --> 00:12:37,601
- Are you just heading in like this? - Gosh, Jun Ki.

292
00:12:38,756 --> 00:12:39,848
All right.

293
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,629
Mom, I'm running behind schedule because of you.

294
00:12:41,797 --> 00:12:44,898
The Nice Man said all kids must go to bed at 9pm.

295
00:13:08,126 --> 00:13:09,320
My gosh!

296
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:12,779
What are you doing? You totally startled me.

297
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:14,119
Goodness.

298
00:13:16,236 --> 00:13:18,635
The quiz show is tomorrow. How could you be sleeping?

299
00:13:18,636 --> 00:13:20,809
- Did you solve all the questions? - I sure did!

300
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:22,398
Really?

301
00:13:24,207 --> 00:13:26,726
Then shall I take a look?

302
00:13:29,846 --> 00:13:33,284
"The government organization that oversees all PR..."

303
00:13:33,386 --> 00:13:36,086
"and external communications needs regarding governmental affairs..."

304
00:13:36,087 --> 00:13:38,255
"through cultural events, campaigns, and publications"...

305
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:39,625
is called YouTube?

306
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:40,708
Yes, YouTube.

307
00:13:42,896 --> 00:13:44,018
Goodness.

308
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,125
What Archimedes shouted as he was jumping out of his bathtub was,

309
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,441
- "It's hot"? Seriously? - Was it, "It's cold"?

310
00:13:50,537 --> 00:13:53,836
How could you be this ignorant?

311
00:13:53,837 --> 00:13:55,846
I told you that I don't want to go on that show.

312
00:13:56,006 --> 00:13:58,455
I skipped dinner because I've been working on the questions nonstop.

313
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:01,706
Yu Ri, I'm hungry. Can I have some food first?

314
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,349
You don't have time to eat dinner now.

315
00:14:03,846 --> 00:14:04,999
If you're hungry,

316
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:08,168
you can eat this.

317
00:14:09,087 --> 00:14:11,299
The new rice cake shop was giving it out earlier.

318
00:14:12,827 --> 00:14:13,949
"Euljimun Rice Cakes"?

319
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,265
What an unusual name for a rice cake shop.

320
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:22,193
Euljimun Rice Cakes is good.

321
00:14:26,837 --> 00:14:28,906
Ki Bong, how are you feeling today?

322
00:14:28,907 --> 00:14:30,233
You can do a good job, right?

323
00:14:30,707 --> 00:14:34,347
I don't even know. What if I end up embarrassing myself?

324
00:14:35,177 --> 00:14:37,185
Stop being negative.

325
00:14:37,547 --> 00:14:39,382
Ki Bong, you can do it.

326
00:14:39,447 --> 00:14:42,200
You got this, okay? Just go for it.

327
00:14:46,187 --> 00:14:47,350
Ki Bong!

328
00:14:50,697 --> 00:14:53,114
- What are you doing? - What do you think of this space?

329
00:14:53,496 --> 00:14:57,235
This place is the closest to my dream restaurant.

330
00:14:57,236 --> 00:14:58,971
- Oh, really? - Yes.

331
00:14:59,207 --> 00:15:00,594
It's small,

332
00:15:00,707 --> 00:15:03,429
but I love how cute and cozy it is.

333
00:15:04,106 --> 00:15:06,829
If I can actually open Yu Ri's Kitchen,

334
00:15:07,146 --> 00:15:09,390
I'll make sure the kitchen is in the middle of the restaurant.

335
00:15:09,547 --> 00:15:11,688
That way, the customers can watch the entire cooking process.

336
00:15:11,776 --> 00:15:13,113
And each table...

337
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:15,905
will have a fresh flower bought that day.

338
00:15:16,817 --> 00:15:20,020
And there will be a small blackboard in front of the restaurant.

339
00:15:20,157 --> 00:15:22,355
On the blackboard, I'll write down...

340
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:24,539
"Chef Cha Yu Ri's Recommendations of the Day".

341
00:15:26,197 --> 00:15:27,860
Just thinking about it makes you that happy?

342
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:29,619
Yes, of course.

343
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,825
It's been my lifelong dream.

344
00:15:34,707 --> 00:15:36,134
Okay, got it.

345
00:15:36,677 --> 00:15:39,665
I'll do my very best today for you,

346
00:15:39,846 --> 00:15:41,234
so just trust me. You can count on me.

347
00:15:41,746 --> 00:15:42,868
Seriously?

348
00:15:44,976 --> 00:15:46,344
You make me proud.

349
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,416
- Yu Ri, we'll be late. Let's hurry. - It's so nice.

350
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:51,456
- What? - Come on.

351
00:15:51,457 --> 00:15:52,579
We're not late.

352
00:15:53,356 --> 00:15:56,111
- We may run late. - My gosh, look at you!

353
00:15:56,626 --> 00:16:00,748
Yes, that's right! Here we go, Nice Man!

354
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:03,431
- Jun Ki. - Yes, hello.

355
00:16:03,766 --> 00:16:07,203
Did you kiss some girl on the street around 9:30pm last night?

356
00:16:07,437 --> 00:16:09,975
Sorry? How did you know...

357
00:16:09,976 --> 00:16:11,975
Someone posted another complaint on our website,

358
00:16:11,976 --> 00:16:13,745
saying you were kissing some girl after 9pm...

359
00:16:13,746 --> 00:16:16,745
when you told all kids to be in bed by then and that it's disappointing.

360
00:16:16,746 --> 00:16:18,001
- Seriously? - Yes.

361
00:16:18,146 --> 00:16:21,410
The kid is bawling, saying she'll never believe anything you say.

362
00:16:21,986 --> 00:16:23,721
Gosh, when did she see that?

363
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,305
Sir, I'm an adult.

364
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,625
I can be out after 9pm, and I should be allowed to date, right?

365
00:16:30,626 --> 00:16:31,718
What?

366
00:16:31,797 --> 00:16:33,625
Hey, the first Nice Man...

367
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,836
cuffed himself after 9pm.

368
00:16:35,837 --> 00:16:38,836
Why? Because he was worried he might go out in sleep.

369
00:16:38,837 --> 00:16:40,706
You need that level of professionalism.

370
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:41,829
He cuffed himself?

371
00:16:42,677 --> 00:16:44,235
- But the thing is... - Be quiet!

372
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:45,461
Do you not want to be a star?

373
00:16:45,677 --> 00:16:47,706
I do. I want to be...

374
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:49,032
- a star! - Then behave yourself!

375
00:16:49,577 --> 00:16:53,085
If this happens again, I'll find your replacement.

376
00:16:53,587 --> 00:16:55,524
You'll... You'll find my replacement?

377
00:16:56,317 --> 00:16:59,142
Gosh, what am I supposed to do?

378
00:17:02,226 --> 00:17:05,419
Why isn't Jun Ki here yet? The movie is about to start.

379
00:17:06,597 --> 00:17:07,789
- Soo Mi! - My gosh!

380
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:12,065
- Who are you? - It's me, Jun Ki.

381
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:13,065
Jun Ki?

382
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,464
I'm sorry I'm late.

383
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:18,036
There were a lot of kids on the way, so I had to make a detour.

384
00:17:18,207 --> 00:17:20,745
Why are you wearing the mask and sunglasses?

385
00:17:20,746 --> 00:17:23,164
Kids recognize me and post weird complaints on the website.

386
00:17:23,847 --> 00:17:26,146
All right, let's go.

387
00:17:26,147 --> 00:17:27,339
We'll be late for the movie.

388
00:17:29,556 --> 00:17:31,861
Oh, you're the Nice Man!

389
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:35,585
No, I'm not the Nice Man.

390
00:17:35,586 --> 00:17:37,055
You are.

391
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:40,664
I can tell from your voice.

392
00:17:41,097 --> 00:17:44,054
You told us that we should never lie to anyone.

393
00:17:44,736 --> 00:17:47,664
- I'm going to tell all my friends. - No, don't.

394
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:51,492
I was kidding. I was just teasing you.

395
00:17:51,907 --> 00:17:55,752
The Nice Man never lies.

396
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:59,846
I'm a little busy at the moment, so I should get going.

397
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:01,754
The Nice Man, wait!

398
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:04,785
Could you please find this dog's owner first?

399
00:18:04,786 --> 00:18:05,909
What?

400
00:18:07,226 --> 00:18:11,025
I'm quite busy at the moment. Perhaps next time...

401
00:18:11,026 --> 00:18:14,127
My gosh. You said we must never...

402
00:18:14,197 --> 00:18:16,237
walk away from animals that are in need of help.

403
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:18,096
How could the Nice Man be like this?

404
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,401
Okay, fine. I'll help the dog.

405
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:26,628
Soo Mi, do you mind if we find the dog owner first?

406
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,775
What about the movie, then?

407
00:18:27,776 --> 00:18:30,146
- We'll watch it another time. - Forget it!

408
00:18:30,147 --> 00:18:31,371
I'm leaving.

409
00:18:32,347 --> 00:18:34,764
Soo Mi, wait. Soo Mi.

410
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,143
This is driving me crazy.

411
00:18:44,026 --> 00:18:46,126
Jung Eun, you don't want any fried chicken?

412
00:18:46,127 --> 00:18:47,525
I have no appetite.

413
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,735
You seem down these days.

414
00:18:49,736 --> 00:18:51,400
What's wrong? Did something bad happen?

415
00:18:51,437 --> 00:18:54,222
What? No, it's nothing.

416
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:57,676
Oh, it's starting. I see Ki Bong there.

417
00:18:57,677 --> 00:19:00,910
Welcome to "Challenge! King of Quiz".

418
00:19:01,447 --> 00:19:04,098
First, let me introduce the contestants.

419
00:19:04,217 --> 00:19:07,716
Contestant number one. A current KAIST professor,

420
00:19:07,816 --> 00:19:09,214
Mr. Wang Yeong Jae.

421
00:19:09,786 --> 00:19:10,878
Hello.

422
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:14,025
Contestant number two earned his doctorate degree at Harvard,

423
00:19:14,026 --> 00:19:16,696
and he currently works at NASA...

424
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,930
as a senior researcher. Mr. Lee Su Seok.

425
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:21,366
Hello.

426
00:19:21,367 --> 00:19:23,295
Lastly, contestant number three.

427
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:25,265
A former professional baseball player,

428
00:19:25,266 --> 00:19:28,735
who's now a car dealer, Mr. Kook Ki Bong.

429
00:19:29,677 --> 00:19:30,798
Hello!

430
00:19:30,907 --> 00:19:32,743
Harvard and KAIST?

431
00:19:32,976 --> 00:19:35,176
Ki Bong has to beat those people?

432
00:19:35,177 --> 00:19:36,916
Gosh, that's simply impossible.

433
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:41,201
It's like an amateur soccer player going up against Ronaldo and Messi.

434
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,499
I feel so bad for Ki Bong.

435
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:46,525
All right, "Challenge! King of Quiz".

436
00:19:46,526 --> 00:19:48,321
Let's get started.

437
00:19:48,357 --> 00:19:50,295
You'll lose points with each wrong answer.

438
00:19:50,296 --> 00:19:52,918
So think before you push the buzzer.

439
00:19:53,197 --> 00:19:54,480
Here's the first question.

440
00:19:54,504 --> 00:19:56,766
A king's face is called "yongan".

441
00:19:56,766 --> 00:19:59,606
A king's tears are called "yongru".

442
00:19:59,607 --> 00:20:03,279
Then what are a king's stools called?

443
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,735
- Let me answer. - Mr. Wang.

444
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:06,106
- Yongbyeon. - "Yongbyeon"?

445
00:20:06,107 --> 00:20:07,305
That must be correct.

446
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,470
Wrong.

447
00:20:08,476 --> 00:20:10,486
You lost 10 points.

448
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,376
- Let me answer. - Mr. Lee.

449
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,515
- Wangttong. - "Wangttong"?

450
00:20:14,516 --> 00:20:15,842
Wrong.

451
00:20:15,887 --> 00:20:18,116
Mr. Lee lost 10 points as well.

452
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:20,255
Now it's Mr. Kook's turn to answer.

453
00:20:20,256 --> 00:20:21,307
Mr. Kook.

454
00:20:25,026 --> 00:20:26,149
Pass.

455
00:20:26,427 --> 00:20:28,058
He passed.

456
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:29,936
The correct answer is "maehwa".

457
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,242
Let's move on to the next question.

458
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,235
Let me answer. A black hole.

459
00:20:34,236 --> 00:20:35,335
Let me answer. Gahwamansaseong.

460
00:20:35,336 --> 00:20:37,173
Wrong. You lost points.

461
00:20:37,177 --> 00:20:38,604
- Mr. Kook. - Pass.

462
00:20:38,677 --> 00:20:40,787
Pass. I said, pass.

463
00:20:40,847 --> 00:20:44,515
Pass! Pass! Pass! Pass! Pass!

464
00:20:44,516 --> 00:20:46,384
- Hey. - Pass!

465
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:50,013
- Pass! - He passed again.

466
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:52,156
Pass.

467
00:20:52,157 --> 00:20:53,993
He passed yet again.

468
00:20:54,357 --> 00:20:55,958
Let's move on.

469
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,596
In the satirical novel, "Baebijangjeon",

470
00:20:58,597 --> 00:21:01,295
what did the protagonist, Bae Bi Jang,

471
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:03,936
give to the gisaeng, Ae Rang, as a symbol of his love?

472
00:21:03,937 --> 00:21:05,732
- Let me answer. - Mr. Lee.

473
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,265
- A diamond? - Wrong.

474
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,634
Let me answer. A tip?

475
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,676
A "tip"?

476
00:21:10,976 --> 00:21:13,252
A "tip"? Wrong.

477
00:21:13,546 --> 00:21:15,406
You lost 20 points.

478
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,616
This is the last question of the preliminary round,

479
00:21:17,617 --> 00:21:18,974
and it's Mr. Kook's turn to answer.

480
00:21:19,016 --> 00:21:20,036
Mr. Kook.

481
00:21:28,627 --> 00:21:29,656
Pass.

482
00:21:29,657 --> 00:21:32,992
He even passed the last question.

483
00:21:33,127 --> 00:21:37,265
Mr. Kook passed all the questions, and his score is still zero.

484
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:40,805
Therefore, he moves on to the final round!

485
00:21:42,976 --> 00:21:45,353
Let's go! I can do this!

486
00:21:46,377 --> 00:21:47,397
Yu Ri.

487
00:21:51,246 --> 00:21:52,266
(Mr. Kook moves on to the final round!)

488
00:21:54,786 --> 00:21:55,837
What just happened?

489
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:59,008
Did Ki Bong just make it to the final round?

490
00:21:59,627 --> 00:22:00,708
Unbelievable.

491
00:22:10,637 --> 00:22:12,432
What happened to Soo Mi?

492
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:14,744
She isn't picking up her phone, and she's not home.

493
00:22:23,177 --> 00:22:24,197
Soo Mi.

494
00:22:25,246 --> 00:22:26,440
Jun Ki.

495
00:22:30,957 --> 00:22:32,181
Who's this guy?

496
00:22:33,026 --> 00:22:36,255
I can't date you anymore. It's too hard for me.

497
00:22:36,256 --> 00:22:39,896
Still, you can't do this without saying anything to me.

498
00:22:39,897 --> 00:22:42,696
Why don't you stop? You're being too low and unmanly.

499
00:22:42,697 --> 00:22:44,502
What? I'm being low?

500
00:22:45,796 --> 00:22:48,255
You jerk. Are you done now?

501
00:22:48,937 --> 00:22:50,505
- How can you do this? - What are you doing?

502
00:22:50,506 --> 00:22:52,636
- Who are you? - Let's go.

503
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,376
Oh, that's the Nice Man.

504
00:22:54,377 --> 00:22:56,968
- Hi, Nice Man. - It's the Nice Man.

505
00:22:57,046 --> 00:22:59,416
Nice Man, what are you doing right now?

506
00:22:59,417 --> 00:23:01,045
Don't tell me you're fighting.

507
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,045
You said it's bad to fight with a friend.

508
00:23:09,026 --> 00:23:11,270
Oh, well...

509
00:23:11,427 --> 00:23:12,998
The thing is...

510
00:23:13,167 --> 00:23:14,859
This is driving me crazy.

511
00:23:15,367 --> 00:23:18,427
What if I fight in front of these kids and get fired?

512
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:21,514
Still, I can't stand the thought of just walking away from here.

513
00:23:22,566 --> 00:23:23,934
What should I do?

514
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:25,698
Right.

515
00:23:26,746 --> 00:23:27,869
Soo Mi.

516
00:23:28,506 --> 00:23:30,416
No, no.

517
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:32,745
- No, no. - No, no.

518
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:35,245
A nice grown-up shouldn't go on a date with another man...

519
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:38,071
behind her boyfriend's back.

520
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:39,992
And you, whatever your name is!

521
00:23:41,026 --> 00:23:44,396
You shouldn't do this either. No, no.

522
00:23:44,397 --> 00:23:46,696
- No, no. - No, no.

523
00:23:46,697 --> 00:23:50,896
A nice grown-up shouldn't steal another man's girlfriend.

524
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:55,048
It's a very low and unmanly thing to do.

525
00:23:55,306 --> 00:23:58,438
Well, I have to go now.

526
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,846
I hope you two live happily together...

527
00:24:01,847 --> 00:24:04,162
until you go senile.

528
00:24:04,246 --> 00:24:05,337
Excuse me now.

529
00:24:05,516 --> 00:24:07,627
Nice Man, you can't leave yet.

530
00:24:08,187 --> 00:24:09,952
You forgot something.

531
00:24:10,486 --> 00:24:11,608
I forgot something?

532
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:22,541
- Here we go, Nice Man! - Here we go, Nice Man!

533
00:24:22,697 --> 00:24:24,941
- Bye! - Bye!

534
00:24:25,437 --> 00:24:26,896
All right, Mr. Kook.

535
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:30,538
By winning the preliminary round, you won 5,000 dollars.

536
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,106
If you decide to go on to the final round...

537
00:24:33,107 --> 00:24:36,004
and get all three questions right,

538
00:24:36,246 --> 00:24:39,745
you'll win 40,000 dollars.

539
00:24:39,746 --> 00:24:40,785
(Prize: 40,000 dollars)

540
00:24:40,786 --> 00:24:44,255
However, if you get any of the questions wrong,

541
00:24:44,687 --> 00:24:47,992
you lose all your prize money.

542
00:24:48,627 --> 00:24:52,396
- Mr. Kook, would you like to stop? - Stop.

543
00:24:52,397 --> 00:24:53,565
Stop, Ki Bong.

544
00:24:53,566 --> 00:24:56,666
Or would you like to go on to the final round?

545
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:58,136
It's beyond your ability.

546
00:24:58,137 --> 00:24:59,735
That's right. Stop, Ki Bong.

547
00:24:59,736 --> 00:25:00,930
Just give up.

548
00:25:01,437 --> 00:25:02,692
Would you like to go on?

549
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:04,428
Ki Bong.

550
00:25:04,607 --> 00:25:06,615
It's a miracle that you've made it this far.

551
00:25:07,447 --> 00:25:08,599
You have to stop now.

552
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:11,771
Stop!

553
00:25:14,117 --> 00:25:15,474
I'd like to...

554
00:25:16,086 --> 00:25:17,138
No!

555
00:25:25,496 --> 00:25:26,751
Go on!

556
00:25:28,826 --> 00:25:30,500
He wants to go on.

557
00:25:30,836 --> 00:25:31,990
He's crazy.

558
00:25:34,107 --> 00:25:36,484
Why? Why? Why?

559
00:25:36,506 --> 00:25:37,863
Why did you do that?

560
00:25:38,907 --> 00:25:41,151
Yu Ri, you can count on me.

561
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:44,722
I'll be the Quiz King...

562
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:46,621
and buy you a restaurant.

563
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:49,784
I can't believe that brat.

564
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:52,661
What on earth is he thinking?

565
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:57,018
All right. Here's the first question.

566
00:25:57,826 --> 00:25:59,426
Jeju Island is known...

567
00:25:59,427 --> 00:26:02,325
to have no thieves, beggars, or gates,

568
00:26:02,326 --> 00:26:04,845
hence the nickname, "Sammudo".

569
00:26:05,137 --> 00:26:09,389
At the same time, Jeju Island has plenty of three things,

570
00:26:09,506 --> 00:26:11,751
which gives it its nickname, "Samdado".

571
00:26:12,036 --> 00:26:14,760
What are these three things?

572
00:26:15,947 --> 00:26:18,772
I have no idea. I have absolutely no idea.

573
00:26:19,147 --> 00:26:21,666
What's up with the names, "Sammudo" and "Samdado"?

574
00:26:22,516 --> 00:26:23,607
Wait.

575
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:25,243
"Samdado"?

576
00:26:25,556 --> 00:26:28,626
Rocks, wind, and women are what Jeju Island is known for.

577
00:26:28,627 --> 00:26:31,615
It's called "Samdado" because it has plenty of the three.

578
00:26:33,296 --> 00:26:34,347
Let me answer!

579
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:38,721
Rocks, wind, and women.

580
00:26:39,236 --> 00:26:40,335
Correct!

581
00:26:40,336 --> 00:26:42,166
Nice! Yes!

582
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,505
Ki Bong gave his first answer, and it was correct.

583
00:26:44,506 --> 00:26:45,636
How did Ki Bong know that?

584
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:46,846
I know.

585
00:26:46,847 --> 00:26:48,101
I guess he got lucky.

586
00:26:48,147 --> 00:26:49,846
- How could they ask about that? - All right.

587
00:26:49,847 --> 00:26:51,509
Here's the second question.

588
00:26:52,417 --> 00:26:55,916
This is the world's longest woodwind instrument.

589
00:26:56,347 --> 00:26:58,585
Originally used by the shepherds in the Alps,

590
00:26:58,586 --> 00:27:01,239
it's a traditional Swiss instrument.

591
00:27:01,857 --> 00:27:05,365
What is the name of the instrument in the picture?

592
00:27:05,826 --> 00:27:07,835
That looks somehow familiar.

593
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:13,196
That's what Jung Eun was playing.

594
00:27:13,437 --> 00:27:14,833
What was its name?

595
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,557
Let me answer!

596
00:27:17,276 --> 00:27:18,531
Alphorn.

597
00:27:18,677 --> 00:27:19,870
"Alphorn".

598
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:21,606
It's correct!

599
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:22,606
I don't believe this.

600
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:25,245
- Nice! - This question was pretty hard.

601
00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:26,315
Unbelievable.

602
00:27:26,316 --> 00:27:28,315
They asked him about the alphorn.

603
00:27:28,316 --> 00:27:30,255
If he gets just one more question right,

604
00:27:30,256 --> 00:27:32,123
does he become the Quiz King?

605
00:27:32,157 --> 00:27:34,369
Mr. Kook now only has to get...

606
00:27:34,457 --> 00:27:39,148
one more question right to win 40,000 dollars.

607
00:27:39,726 --> 00:27:41,297
Here's the last question.

608
00:27:42,266 --> 00:27:43,966
When the Sui general Yu Zhongwen...

609
00:27:43,967 --> 00:27:47,231
invaded Goguryeo with his 300,000 troops,

610
00:27:47,306 --> 00:27:51,735
he was ridiculed by a poem written by...

611
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:55,305
Goguryeo's greatest war hero. Who is this?

612
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:58,000
I have no idea. I don't have the slightest idea.

613
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,962
I've never heard about anything like this in my whole life.

614
00:28:01,586 --> 00:28:04,412
Mr. Kook seems to be trying to remember the name.

615
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:06,521
There's a hint on the screen.

616
00:28:06,887 --> 00:28:11,588
Who is the person in the portrait on the screen?

617
00:28:12,496 --> 00:28:15,352
Wait. I've seen this portrait somewhere.

618
00:28:16,197 --> 00:28:18,237
What an unusual name for a rice cake shop.

619
00:28:20,137 --> 00:28:21,466
I know!

620
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:22,487
Let me answer!

621
00:28:26,947 --> 00:28:28,068
Euljimun Rice Cakes.

622
00:28:30,046 --> 00:28:31,169
"Rice Cakes"?

623
00:28:31,246 --> 00:28:33,531
Can you say it more clearly?

624
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:37,454
I was sure it was "Euljimun Rice Cakes".

625
00:28:37,586 --> 00:28:38,606
Is it wrong?

626
00:28:38,687 --> 00:28:39,982
Then what could it be?

627
00:28:40,157 --> 00:28:42,166
Ki Bong.

628
00:28:43,357 --> 00:28:45,029
It's "deok".

629
00:28:46,026 --> 00:28:47,730
"Deok". Like a duck.

630
00:28:48,367 --> 00:28:49,387
A duck.

631
00:28:51,236 --> 00:28:52,287
A duck.

632
00:28:55,006 --> 00:28:56,057
Let me answer!

633
00:28:56,137 --> 00:28:57,708
Euljimun Quack.

634
00:28:57,776 --> 00:29:00,664
"Quack"? "Euljimun Quack"?

635
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:03,734
All right. You have three seconds.

636
00:29:04,016 --> 00:29:05,067
One.

637
00:29:05,246 --> 00:29:07,815
Let me answer! Euljimun Duck.

638
00:29:07,816 --> 00:29:10,315
No? Euljimun Mallard.

639
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:13,055
What about my 40,000 dollars?

640
00:29:13,056 --> 00:29:14,126
Euljimun...

641
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,926
No. Euljimun Donald Duck!

642
00:29:16,927 --> 00:29:20,028
You idiot! Why did you even try?

643
00:29:32,836 --> 00:29:34,845
I'm sorry, Yu Ri.

644
00:29:35,947 --> 00:29:37,752
- I really am. - Be quiet.

645
00:29:38,046 --> 00:29:39,883
What? "Euljimun Quack"?

646
00:29:40,147 --> 00:29:41,615
"Euljimun Mallard"?

647
00:29:41,687 --> 00:29:43,085
"Euljimun Donald Duck"?

648
00:29:43,086 --> 00:29:44,892
You were saying, "quack, quack". That's why I thought...

649
00:29:47,387 --> 00:29:49,528
Anyway, I'm so sorry.

650
00:29:50,256 --> 00:29:52,980
I promise I'll help you open your restaurant later.

651
00:29:53,256 --> 00:29:56,561
I'm a man who always keeps his word.

652
00:29:56,637 --> 00:29:59,218
"A man's word is worth his weight in installments." You know, right?

653
00:30:00,806 --> 00:30:03,035
What? "A man's word is worth his weight in installments?"

654
00:30:03,036 --> 00:30:07,055
Yes. It means a man's words are as important as paying installments.

655
00:30:07,447 --> 00:30:10,129
When you sign a contract, do you know how important installments are?

656
00:30:10,316 --> 00:30:12,898
If you don't pay that, your contract will be terminated.

657
00:30:13,516 --> 00:30:14,811
You lunatic.

658
00:30:17,217 --> 00:30:19,226
- What? What's wrong? - Hey.

659
00:30:20,226 --> 00:30:23,970
- I can't stand this any longer. - Don't come near me. I'm sorry.

660
00:30:24,826 --> 00:30:25,896
- What are you doing? - Come here.

661
00:30:25,897 --> 00:30:27,725
Yu Ri, I'm sorry. Don't come near me!

662
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:29,562
Hey, wait. Yu Ri!

663
00:30:32,967 --> 00:30:35,265
Why does the producer suddenly want to see us?

664
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:38,206
What if he asks us to buy tickets for his sister's recital again?

665
00:30:38,207 --> 00:30:39,838
I have a bad feeling.

666
00:30:39,976 --> 00:30:41,098
Good morning.

667
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:42,599
- Hello. - Good morning.

668
00:30:42,877 --> 00:30:45,116
Sir, why did you ask us to gather here?

669
00:30:45,117 --> 00:30:47,054
My book has been finally published.

670
00:30:47,187 --> 00:30:48,952
I wanted to give them to you as gifts.

671
00:30:50,157 --> 00:30:52,432
- Here you go. - Wow!

672
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:54,623
- Thank you. - Thank you.

673
00:30:55,226 --> 00:30:57,062
This isn't just for free, right?

674
00:30:57,296 --> 00:30:59,325
I'll buy these. Give me 10 books.

675
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:00,525
I'll take 20.

676
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:03,454
I didn't call you for this. You guys are so generous.

677
00:31:03,766 --> 00:31:05,296
- Soo Yeon, how many do you want? - Sorry?

678
00:31:06,536 --> 00:31:07,760
I don't need any.

679
00:31:08,137 --> 00:31:09,839
I'm not interested in famous restaurants.

680
00:31:09,907 --> 00:31:11,844
I see, you're not interested.

681
00:31:12,076 --> 00:31:13,335
Too bad then.

682
00:31:13,336 --> 00:31:16,304
Ms. Han, let me see your comments for this reporting.

683
00:31:16,447 --> 00:31:17,671
Oh, okay.

684
00:31:20,347 --> 00:31:21,509
Here you go.

685
00:31:25,657 --> 00:31:26,881
What's wrong?

686
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:28,785
You don't like my comments?

687
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:31,956
This isn't interesting or touching at all.

688
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:33,222
It's a total mess.

689
00:31:33,627 --> 00:31:35,258
What's wrong with the spelling?

690
00:31:35,467 --> 00:31:38,700
Look. It's "family picnic", not family picnik.

691
00:31:38,766 --> 00:31:42,480
It's also "fun activities", not "fun activitys".

692
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,406
I'm sorry, I've made a mistake.

693
00:31:44,407 --> 00:31:45,676
This isn't a mistake.

694
00:31:45,677 --> 00:31:47,748
Even elementary school students know this.

695
00:31:47,877 --> 00:31:50,672
How could you be worse than my 10-year-old nephew at spelling?

696
00:31:50,717 --> 00:31:53,216
How could this guy speak so obnoxiously?

697
00:31:53,217 --> 00:31:55,868
Not only is your diction inaccurate,

698
00:31:55,917 --> 00:31:57,916
but you'll have to study spelling from the beginning.

699
00:31:57,917 --> 00:31:59,854
I just want to sew that mouth shut...

700
00:32:01,226 --> 00:32:02,307
What are you doing?

701
00:32:04,627 --> 00:32:05,850
It's nothing.

702
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:09,949
I want to check things.

703
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:32,253
- Wow. - This is amazing!

704
00:32:34,927 --> 00:32:36,109
It's really delicious.

705
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:38,827
I know. It fits my taste perfectly.

706
00:32:39,197 --> 00:32:41,596
- You haven't lost your touch. - Really?

707
00:32:41,597 --> 00:32:44,065
Then do you think Yu Ri's Kitchen 31 will be a success?

708
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:45,396
What is Yu Ri's Kitchen 31?

709
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:47,106
I've decided the concept as...

710
00:32:47,107 --> 00:32:49,922
31 types of spaghetti that's fun to choose.

711
00:32:50,236 --> 00:32:52,335
I've decided the name of this as "Mom is a Spaghetti Alien".

712
00:32:52,336 --> 00:32:53,646
What do you think? Isn't it unique?

713
00:32:53,647 --> 00:32:55,849
Hang on. Yu Ri's Kitchen 31?

714
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:57,140
"Mom is a Spaghetti Alien"?

715
00:32:57,816 --> 00:32:59,245
That sounds strangely familiar.

716
00:32:59,776 --> 00:33:01,515
Don't tell me the other spaghetti names are...

717
00:33:01,516 --> 00:33:03,862
"Very Berry Spaghetti" or "Almond Vongole". Are they?

718
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:07,169
That's confidential.

719
00:33:10,157 --> 00:33:14,176
Anyway, what's the point of making new menus?

720
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:15,896
I don't even have a restaurant.

721
00:33:17,236 --> 00:33:20,398
Only if he answered those questions right, there would be no problem.

722
00:33:21,107 --> 00:33:22,871
Gosh, this is so yummy.

723
00:33:23,336 --> 00:33:26,075
- Why aren't you eating? - I don't have an appetite.

724
00:33:26,076 --> 00:33:28,555
Just leave her be. There isn't enough for me anyway.

725
00:33:28,647 --> 00:33:31,146
Do you even have an appetite after being dumped so pathetically?

726
00:33:31,147 --> 00:33:34,614
Hey! I told you not to talk about Soo Mi.

727
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:37,686
Also, I wasn't dumped. I dumped her.

728
00:33:37,687 --> 00:33:40,325
How many times do I have to tell you?

729
00:33:40,326 --> 00:33:42,774
What? Did you break up with your girlfriend?

730
00:33:43,056 --> 00:33:45,240
- Yes. - I see.

731
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:50,203
I thought you had no appetite.

732
00:33:52,566 --> 00:33:56,505
Excuse me. Where is the ATM near here?

733
00:33:56,506 --> 00:33:57,735
Oh, an ATM?

734
00:33:57,736 --> 00:34:00,245
If you go out and take a right, you'll find it nearby.

735
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:02,113
Okay. Thank you.

736
00:34:05,617 --> 00:34:07,657
Hey, that guest.

737
00:34:07,717 --> 00:34:09,757
Doesn't he have a strange vibe about him?

738
00:34:09,816 --> 00:34:12,641
- Something seems grim about him. - I don't know. I haven't felt it.

739
00:34:13,186 --> 00:34:14,309
Really?

740
00:34:16,427 --> 00:34:19,997
Whatever. Anyway, is there a way I can make money?

741
00:34:20,997 --> 00:34:23,636
Dear Almighty, if you have any money to spare,

742
00:34:23,637 --> 00:34:26,625
can you throw it down at me? Please?

743
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:27,966
(The Culprit is...)

744
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:30,659
(You)

745
00:34:35,577 --> 00:34:38,275
How did Jun Ki know about "Very Berry Spaghetti"...

746
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:40,081
and "Almond Vongole"?

747
00:34:40,517 --> 00:34:41,669
He totally read my mind.

748
00:34:43,546 --> 00:34:45,424
Wait. What is that?

749
00:34:47,356 --> 00:34:48,549
For rent?

750
00:34:49,086 --> 00:34:51,270
What? I think this place is out for sale.

751
00:34:52,697 --> 00:34:54,910
A down payment of 40,000 and monthly rent of 3,000 dollars?

752
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:57,780
Gosh, that's so expensive.

753
00:34:58,967 --> 00:35:00,741
What use is it if this place is out for rent?

754
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,459
I can't afford it.

755
00:35:08,347 --> 00:35:09,500
What is that?

756
00:35:11,847 --> 00:35:13,172
40,000 dollars?

757
00:35:13,276 --> 00:35:15,224
The reward for finding that criminal is 40,000 dollars?

758
00:35:17,287 --> 00:35:20,040
If only I can catch him, I can afford my restaurant.

759
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:22,585
(Criminal wanted for fraud, Kim Chul Jung, 40,000 dollars)

760
00:35:22,586 --> 00:35:25,411
But why does he look so familiar?

761
00:35:27,597 --> 00:35:30,295
Where is the ATM near here?

762
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:31,357
(Criminal wanted for fraud, Kim Chul Jung, 40,000 dollars)

763
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:41,608
What do you think? Doesn't he look like that guest we saw?

764
00:35:42,606 --> 00:35:45,915
I'm not sure. He does seem similar in a way,

765
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:47,815
but he seems different too.

766
00:35:47,816 --> 00:35:50,315
But he has a mustache and wears glasses.

767
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:53,955
He can just shave his mustache and not wear glasses.

768
00:35:53,956 --> 00:35:55,894
- In order not to get caught. - You're right.

769
00:35:56,686 --> 00:35:59,326
Come to think of it, he does look similar.

770
00:35:59,327 --> 00:36:00,825
I'm certain it's him.

771
00:36:01,796 --> 00:36:04,041
Gosh, I'm so lucky.

772
00:36:04,597 --> 00:36:07,391
I'll be able to open Yu Ri's Kitchen with 40,000 dollars.

773
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:09,866
What?

774
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,375
You're going to open your restaurant by turning him in?

775
00:36:12,376 --> 00:36:13,560
Of course.

776
00:36:14,106 --> 00:36:15,433
I'll report him to the police right now.

777
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:16,976
Are you insane?

778
00:36:16,977 --> 00:36:19,119
How could you report him when you're not even sure?

779
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:22,278
If you're wrong, he'll sue us for making false accusations.

780
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:24,426
- Really? - Of course.

781
00:36:26,157 --> 00:36:29,083
Then I have no choice.

782
00:36:29,157 --> 00:36:30,626
I'll have to check.

783
00:36:30,727 --> 00:36:33,582
How? You can't make him wear glasses...

784
00:36:33,657 --> 00:36:34,866
or attach a mustache on his face.

785
00:36:34,867 --> 00:36:36,499
There's always a way.

786
00:36:37,497 --> 00:36:39,914
I'm telling you, just trust me.

787
00:36:43,836 --> 00:36:46,591
You all did a great job shooting on the weekend.

788
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,440
You did great too, sir.

789
00:36:49,506 --> 00:36:52,116
Shouldn't we throw a welcome party for Soo Yeon?

790
00:36:52,117 --> 00:36:53,315
A welcome party?

791
00:36:53,316 --> 00:36:55,346
She's not even an official reporter. What for?

792
00:36:55,347 --> 00:36:57,315
Still, we should throw her a party.

793
00:36:57,316 --> 00:36:58,582
Suit yourselves.

794
00:36:59,057 --> 00:37:01,085
Soo Yeon, what do you like?

795
00:37:01,086 --> 00:37:02,413
I like meat.

796
00:37:02,626 --> 00:37:04,196
This is meat?

797
00:37:04,197 --> 00:37:06,268
Why? You don't consider chicken feet as meat?

798
00:37:06,456 --> 00:37:09,486
I thought Soo Yeon was only bad at spelling,

799
00:37:09,566 --> 00:37:11,168
but she even lacks common sense.

800
00:37:11,566 --> 00:37:12,735
Let's all have a drink.

801
00:37:12,736 --> 00:37:13,788
Cheers.

802
00:37:13,907 --> 00:37:15,130
Cheers.

803
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:18,470
Excuse me.

804
00:37:19,506 --> 00:37:21,618
Yes, ma'am. What?

805
00:37:22,177 --> 00:37:23,400
Okay.

806
00:37:24,177 --> 00:37:28,196
Sir, the main writer needs us, so we should get going.

807
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:30,386
- What should we do? - I understand.

808
00:37:30,387 --> 00:37:31,455
I'm sorry, Soo Yeon.

809
00:37:31,456 --> 00:37:33,660
- Let's do this another time. - Okay.

810
00:37:34,526 --> 00:37:35,955
- Goodbye. - Bye.

811
00:37:37,456 --> 00:37:39,056
Shall we go too?

812
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:41,474
Why? You don't want to drink with me?

813
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:45,226
- No, it's not that... - Oh, you can't drink?

814
00:37:46,066 --> 00:37:49,335
Ms. Han, you're bad at spelling,

815
00:37:49,336 --> 00:37:50,735
lack common sense,

816
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:52,076
and can't even drink.

817
00:37:52,077 --> 00:37:54,015
- What is it that you're good... - Fine.

818
00:37:54,376 --> 00:37:56,284
Let's drink. I'll drink with you.

819
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:03,832
- Satisfied? - You should say cheers first.

820
00:38:03,956 --> 00:38:06,436
You don't even have good drinking manners.

821
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:17,390
Ta-da!

822
00:38:17,736 --> 00:38:19,634
What are you doing?

823
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:22,205
Congratulations. You're the winner of...

824
00:38:22,206 --> 00:38:25,036
the one-year anniversary event of our guest house!

825
00:38:25,037 --> 00:38:26,159
Event?

826
00:38:27,506 --> 00:38:29,853
The prize for the one-year anniversary event...

827
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:32,013
- is just three bottles of beer? - Sorry?

828
00:38:33,117 --> 00:38:35,870
If you want, I can give you a couple more bottles.

829
00:38:36,986 --> 00:38:40,046
But isn't it boring to just drink like this?

830
00:38:40,356 --> 00:38:41,784
Do you want to play a game?

831
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:43,656
- How about a word relay? - Word relay?

832
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:46,248
Yes. And to make things more interesting,

833
00:38:46,396 --> 00:38:48,059
let's draw on the loser's face.

834
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:50,735
You know, like drawing a mustache and glasses.

835
00:38:50,736 --> 00:38:52,866
- Doesn't it sound fun? - No, I don't want...

836
00:38:52,867 --> 00:38:54,266
I'll go first then.

837
00:38:54,267 --> 00:38:56,705
- Singer. - An R?

838
00:38:56,706 --> 00:38:58,235
You have to answer within three seconds.

839
00:38:58,236 --> 00:38:59,875
3, 2...

840
00:38:59,876 --> 00:39:01,713
- Rooster? - Rooster? Another R?

841
00:39:03,447 --> 00:39:04,945
The first game was just practice.

842
00:39:05,646 --> 00:39:08,401
Then let's begin the real game now.

843
00:39:09,287 --> 00:39:12,040
- Since you won, go first. - Okay.

844
00:39:13,287 --> 00:39:14,960
- Telephone. - E?

845
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:17,252
- Earth. - H?

846
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,478
H...

847
00:39:19,727 --> 00:39:22,756
- Hen. - N? N...

848
00:39:23,626 --> 00:39:25,707
This was a warm-up game.

849
00:39:25,836 --> 00:39:27,703
Since we're all warmed up,

850
00:39:27,836 --> 00:39:30,356
let's really begin the real game now.

851
00:39:30,606 --> 00:39:31,658
All right.

852
00:39:31,776 --> 00:39:33,205
- Peach. - H?

853
00:39:35,077 --> 00:39:36,780
- Herb. - B?

854
00:39:37,517 --> 00:39:38,903
- B? - B.

855
00:39:40,816 --> 00:39:43,163
- What starts with a B? - You have three seconds.

856
00:39:43,586 --> 00:39:45,656
3, 2...

857
00:39:45,657 --> 00:39:47,258
- Brood hen? - N?

858
00:39:47,657 --> 00:39:49,685
Goodness. I knew you were too overconfident.

859
00:39:49,686 --> 00:39:51,360
You got what you deserved.

860
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:54,210
That man is an expert at that game.

861
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:57,125
He's incredibly smart. I'm sure he's a con man.

862
00:39:57,126 --> 00:39:59,238
Is everyone who's good at that game considered a con man?

863
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:01,605
We can't be certain, so give up already.

864
00:40:01,606 --> 00:40:03,443
No, I can't give up.

865
00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:05,335
To open Yu Ri's Kitchen 31,

866
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:06,836
I need that cash reward.

867
00:40:07,807 --> 00:40:10,915
I'll prove it no matter what, at all costs.

868
00:40:10,916 --> 00:40:13,630
Goodness, no one can stop you.

869
00:40:14,986 --> 00:40:16,650
Wipe that off your face first.

870
00:40:17,557 --> 00:40:18,812
I'd like to,

871
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,383
but I can't as this is permanent marker.

872
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,295
Why did you use a permanent marker?

873
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,368
It's all I had, so I had no choice!

874
00:40:27,126 --> 00:40:28,554
This jerk. I'll teach him a lesson.

875
00:40:29,796 --> 00:40:31,335
What are you going to do now?

876
00:40:31,336 --> 00:40:32,898
Yu Ri! Yu Ri!

877
00:40:40,477 --> 00:40:42,705
Gosh, why can't I eat this?

878
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:44,846
Soo Yeon, you're quite drunk.

879
00:40:44,847 --> 00:40:46,000
Me?

880
00:40:47,517 --> 00:40:48,914
I'm not drunk.

881
00:40:49,117 --> 00:40:50,485
I'm totally sober.

882
00:40:50,486 --> 00:40:53,915
"Sober". That's how it should be pronounced.

883
00:40:53,916 --> 00:40:56,885
Gosh, how could you be so ignorant about your own mother tongue?

884
00:40:58,396 --> 00:41:01,125
This jerk. He's at it again.

885
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:05,766
I can't believe you want to be a reporter. Goodness.

886
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:07,306
Enough already.

887
00:41:07,307 --> 00:41:10,266
Your diction is bad.

888
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:11,476
You can't even spell,

889
00:41:11,477 --> 00:41:13,435
and you don't have good drinking manners.

890
00:41:13,436 --> 00:41:15,846
Is there anything that you can do?

891
00:41:15,847 --> 00:41:17,915
Enough, you jerk!

892
00:41:17,916 --> 00:41:19,476
Did you just slap me?

893
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,685
That's right. I did. What are you going to do about it?

894
00:41:21,686 --> 00:41:23,016
With that chicken foot?

895
00:41:23,017 --> 00:41:26,855
You're being like this because I didn't buy your book, right?

896
00:41:26,856 --> 00:41:28,625
I know that's why you're doing this, you loser.

897
00:41:28,626 --> 00:41:30,286
And stop acting like you know everything.

898
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:33,996
Your mouth is the problem. This mouth of yours.

899
00:41:33,997 --> 00:41:35,597
Get a taste of this.

900
00:41:37,026 --> 00:41:39,179
You're just a lame loser. You little...

901
00:41:40,396 --> 00:41:41,732
Don't you get cheeky with me.

902
00:41:43,706 --> 00:41:45,206
My, I feel so much better now.

903
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:01,513
What is it now?

904
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:03,656
Congratulations.

905
00:42:03,657 --> 00:42:05,795
You've been chosen to participate in our special event celebrating...

906
00:42:05,796 --> 00:42:07,125
the Year of the Golden Pig.

907
00:42:07,126 --> 00:42:09,826
What? An event celebrating the Year of the Golden Pig?

908
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:11,536
Yes, that's right!

909
00:42:11,537 --> 00:42:14,872
The prize is a voucher for a free night at our guesthouse.

910
00:42:15,037 --> 00:42:16,974
We'll play a game. You'll get it if you win.

911
00:42:17,006 --> 00:42:19,423
If you lose, I'll draw on your face.

912
00:42:21,947 --> 00:42:23,885
1, 2, 3!

913
00:42:28,387 --> 00:42:30,662
1, 2...

914
00:42:35,727 --> 00:42:36,777
Three!

915
00:42:41,126 --> 00:42:44,196
All right! This time, the prize is a voucher...

916
00:42:44,197 --> 00:42:45,835
for a free week at our guesthouse.

917
00:42:45,836 --> 00:42:48,065
Let's begin the game celebrating the one-year anniversary...

918
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:49,535
of our renovation.

919
00:42:50,876 --> 00:42:53,529
Get ready and go!

920
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:57,030
Okay.

921
00:42:57,517 --> 00:42:59,413
Get ready and...

922
00:43:02,086 --> 00:43:03,138
Go!

923
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,395
Darn it. This is driving me bonkers.

924
00:43:09,626 --> 00:43:10,656
(Idiot)

925
00:43:10,657 --> 00:43:13,410
There's no space left on your face.

926
00:43:13,456 --> 00:43:14,926
How could you not even win once?

927
00:43:14,927 --> 00:43:16,996
He's like the master of all games.

928
00:43:16,997 --> 00:43:18,266
He's good at every game.

929
00:43:18,267 --> 00:43:19,795
From rock-paper-scissors to the egg game,

930
00:43:19,796 --> 00:43:22,005
we played all sorts of games, but he won every single time.

931
00:43:22,006 --> 00:43:23,638
No one told you to waste your time like this.

932
00:43:24,276 --> 00:43:26,041
- You're not even sure. - Shut it.

933
00:43:27,106 --> 00:43:29,626
By the way, how can I beat him?

934
00:43:30,006 --> 00:43:31,710
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

935
00:43:32,217 --> 00:43:34,114
Just drop it. Don't do anything.

936
00:43:34,387 --> 00:43:35,946
- I'll give it a shot. - Hey.

937
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,616
Even I couldn't beat him.

938
00:43:37,617 --> 00:43:39,685
How is an idiot like you going to win against him?

939
00:43:39,686 --> 00:43:41,556
I'll suggest a game that uses physical strength.

940
00:43:41,557 --> 00:43:43,260
Like arm or foot wrestling, for example.

941
00:43:43,486 --> 00:43:45,056
I'm a strong guy, you know.

942
00:43:45,057 --> 00:43:47,515
So just trust me. You can count on me.

943
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,769
All right, then. Shall I go and see?

944
00:44:01,646 --> 00:44:02,799
He's strong.

945
00:44:02,876 --> 00:44:04,216
He's incredibly strong.

946
00:44:04,217 --> 00:44:07,145
Seriously? How could someone be like that?

947
00:44:07,146 --> 00:44:09,585
Gosh, you two are such amateurs.

948
00:44:09,586 --> 00:44:11,656
You can't win because you're going by the book.

949
00:44:11,657 --> 00:44:12,786
What are you talking about?

950
00:44:12,787 --> 00:44:15,949
If we can't beat him 1-on-1, 2 of us can go up against him together.

951
00:44:16,727 --> 00:44:19,042
He won't be able to beat us if two of us go at him.

952
00:44:19,396 --> 00:44:21,946
Jung Eun, let's go.

953
00:44:22,066 --> 00:44:23,147
Me?

954
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:25,538
You just have to follow my instructions.

955
00:44:26,867 --> 00:44:29,895
All right, then. Shall we go?

956
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:45,007
What the...

957
00:44:46,586 --> 00:44:48,125
Even two people can't beat him.

958
00:44:48,126 --> 00:44:49,615
He really is the master of all games.

959
00:44:49,657 --> 00:44:51,768
He's a pro gamer. He's a genius.

960
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:54,493
You said you could beat him.

961
00:44:54,927 --> 00:44:55,988
Gosh.

962
00:44:58,836 --> 00:44:59,866
Hello.

963
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:02,735
Hello, I got a call that my friend is here, all drunk.

964
00:45:02,736 --> 00:45:04,266
Oh, she's over there.

965
00:45:09,677 --> 00:45:12,064
Soo Yeon, wake up.

966
00:45:16,816 --> 00:45:18,855
Why did you drink so much?

967
00:45:18,856 --> 00:45:19,937
What?

968
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:22,786
They wanted to throw a welcome party for me.

969
00:45:22,787 --> 00:45:24,255
That's why we drank a little.

970
00:45:24,256 --> 00:45:25,450
I see.

971
00:45:26,396 --> 00:45:29,488
By the way, why is there so much sauce around his mouth?

972
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,522
Oh, you're right. I wonder if something happened...

973
00:45:35,006 --> 00:45:37,435
What? You slapped his mouth?

974
00:45:37,436 --> 00:45:38,498
With chicken feet?

975
00:45:38,677 --> 00:45:39,798
Yes.

976
00:45:40,276 --> 00:45:42,826
I couldn't help it because he was being so mean to me.

977
00:45:42,947 --> 00:45:44,375
What should I do, Woo Shik?

978
00:45:44,677 --> 00:45:46,375
He'll hold a grudge and retaliate.

979
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:47,846
What if I get fired?

980
00:45:47,847 --> 00:45:48,969
My gosh...

981
00:45:50,986 --> 00:45:52,485
I fell asleep.

982
00:45:53,756 --> 00:45:54,755
Who are you?

983
00:45:54,756 --> 00:45:57,786
Sorry? Oh, he's my friend.

984
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:58,926
He came to pick me up.

985
00:45:58,927 --> 00:46:00,385
I see.

986
00:46:01,097 --> 00:46:02,117
Gosh, it stings!

987
00:46:02,597 --> 00:46:05,014
My lips... Why do they hurt so much?

988
00:46:07,066 --> 00:46:08,158
What is all this?

989
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,347
Why do I have this sauce all over my lips?

990
00:46:10,606 --> 00:46:13,329
Soo Yeon, did something happen?

991
00:46:13,336 --> 00:46:15,010
I don't remember anything.

992
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,703
You really don't remember anything?

993
00:46:19,316 --> 00:46:22,856
No, I black out often when I drink.

994
00:46:22,986 --> 00:46:24,445
What on earth happened...

995
00:46:25,517 --> 00:46:26,607
Hold on.

996
00:46:29,157 --> 00:46:32,115
I think someone slapped my mouth with chicken feet.

997
00:46:32,197 --> 00:46:35,900
I vaguely remember something, but I can't really recall...

998
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:39,804
What do I do? I guess he remembers what happened.

999
00:46:41,267 --> 00:46:43,143
He said he blacks out easily.

1000
00:46:45,276 --> 00:46:48,101
Sir, how about another drink with me?

1001
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:51,665
Goodness, I finally wiped it all off.

1002
00:46:52,316 --> 00:46:55,918
Darn it! By the way, how are we going to find out who he really is?

1003
00:46:56,546 --> 00:46:57,985
Yu Ri! Yu Ri!

1004
00:46:57,986 --> 00:46:59,685
What is it? What's with all the fuss?

1005
00:46:59,686 --> 00:47:01,685
That man just checked out.

1006
00:47:01,686 --> 00:47:03,585
He left saying something urgent has come up.

1007
00:47:03,586 --> 00:47:06,657
What? Has he figured out that we're suspicious of him?

1008
00:47:07,396 --> 00:47:09,508
Darn it. My 40,000 dollars.

1009
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,067
- Wait up! - Where are you going?

1010
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:14,186
Hey!

1011
00:47:18,314 --> 00:47:19,812
Taxi! Taxi!

1012
00:47:19,883 --> 00:47:22,056
Taxi. Yes, here!

1013
00:47:22,553 --> 00:47:23,634
Taxi!

1014
00:47:23,953 --> 00:47:26,623
Gosh, why is it so hard to hail a taxi?

1015
00:47:26,624 --> 00:47:27,644
Wait!

1016
00:47:34,124 --> 00:47:36,613
- What's going on? - Where are you headed?

1017
00:47:36,863 --> 00:47:39,263
I have an urgent matter to attend to.

1018
00:47:39,264 --> 00:47:41,272
Let's have a quick chat before you go anywhere.

1019
00:47:41,374 --> 00:47:43,139
I'm in a rush now.

1020
00:47:43,503 --> 00:47:44,502
Taxi!

1021
00:47:44,503 --> 00:47:45,931
Where do you think you're going?

1022
00:47:45,943 --> 00:47:47,127
Guys, get him.

1023
00:47:48,014 --> 00:47:49,473
Let go. What are you guys doing now?

1024
00:47:49,474 --> 00:47:51,543
I have to go. No, don't open it!

1025
00:47:51,544 --> 00:47:53,583
- Stay still! - No, don't open it!

1026
00:47:53,584 --> 00:47:54,909
- What is this? - A mask!

1027
00:47:55,563 --> 00:47:57,232
- A knife! - Don't touch my stuff!

1028
00:47:57,233 --> 00:47:59,477
- What? Ropes? - I knew it.

1029
00:47:59,634 --> 00:48:01,337
- Let go! - A wig!

1030
00:48:01,444 --> 00:48:02,673
Something's definitely fishy.

1031
00:48:02,674 --> 00:48:04,132
Guys, don't let him go.

1032
00:48:04,404 --> 00:48:06,213
What on earth is this about?

1033
00:48:06,214 --> 00:48:07,213
Hey.

1034
00:48:07,214 --> 00:48:08,642
No, no. Don't.

1035
00:48:08,643 --> 00:48:09,663
Don't move.

1036
00:48:10,444 --> 00:48:12,831
Pardon? He's not the guy?

1037
00:48:13,214 --> 00:48:14,651
That can't be.

1038
00:48:14,884 --> 00:48:17,653
Look, he looks just like this man.

1039
00:48:17,654 --> 00:48:20,153
I told you that we caught that guy a few days ago.

1040
00:48:20,154 --> 00:48:21,898
That's impossible.

1041
00:48:22,623 --> 00:48:23,923
Open his bag.

1042
00:48:23,924 --> 00:48:26,633
You'll find a knife, a wig, a mask, and so on.

1043
00:48:26,634 --> 00:48:28,162
There are many weird things in it.

1044
00:48:28,163 --> 00:48:29,837
Weird things? Like what?

1045
00:48:31,503 --> 00:48:33,105
- You mean, this? - Look!

1046
00:48:45,614 --> 00:48:47,796
This is for magic tricks.

1047
00:48:48,623 --> 00:48:49,675
Magic tricks?

1048
00:48:49,824 --> 00:48:52,223
I work as a recreation instructor.

1049
00:48:52,224 --> 00:48:55,181
- I sometimes do some magic tricks. - What?

1050
00:48:55,694 --> 00:48:57,255
You're a recreation instructor?

1051
00:48:58,293 --> 00:49:00,171
So that's why he's so good at games.

1052
00:49:00,864 --> 00:49:02,362
He did seem like an expert.

1053
00:49:02,433 --> 00:49:04,719
I know. No wonder we lost every time.

1054
00:49:04,773 --> 00:49:06,202
Whatever!

1055
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:08,404
You did this to my face,

1056
00:49:08,674 --> 00:49:10,872
and I missed a gig. What are you going to do?

1057
00:49:10,873 --> 00:49:12,098
I'm sorry.

1058
00:49:13,313 --> 00:49:16,303
We'll make sure to compensate you, sir.

1059
00:49:17,043 --> 00:49:18,237
I'm really sorry.

1060
00:49:20,654 --> 00:49:23,847
This is so embarrassing.

1061
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:25,723
It's all your fault.

1062
00:49:26,194 --> 00:49:29,387
I know. We lost our money and made a fool of ourselves.

1063
00:49:29,893 --> 00:49:31,321
I'm sorry.

1064
00:49:31,494 --> 00:49:32,891
I didn't do that on purpose.

1065
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:36,528
Wait.

1066
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:40,046
Sir, why are you taking that off?

1067
00:49:40,174 --> 00:49:42,743
What? This place got sold today.

1068
00:49:42,744 --> 00:49:44,538
It's a nice spot, so it gets sold fast.

1069
00:49:48,913 --> 00:49:50,443
Don't be too disappointed.

1070
00:49:50,813 --> 00:49:52,618
We'll find another spot.

1071
00:49:52,654 --> 00:49:53,909
There's no point.

1072
00:49:54,623 --> 00:49:56,083
I don't have any money anyway.

1073
00:49:57,753 --> 00:49:58,916
Let's go.

1074
00:50:06,733 --> 00:50:09,009
- Cheers! - Cheers!

1075
00:50:11,233 --> 00:50:13,172
- By the way, who are you? - Me?

1076
00:50:13,634 --> 00:50:16,123
I'm Soo Yeon's friend.

1077
00:50:16,744 --> 00:50:17,943
You don't remember?

1078
00:50:17,944 --> 00:50:20,729
- No, I don't. - Good. You forgot everything.

1079
00:50:22,043 --> 00:50:23,950
Whoever you are,

1080
00:50:24,514 --> 00:50:25,682
- let's drink. - Okay.

1081
00:50:25,683 --> 00:50:26,876
Cheers.

1082
00:50:27,614 --> 00:50:30,306
What's going on? Soo Yeon, are you sleeping?

1083
00:50:30,623 --> 00:50:33,786
- Soo Yeon. Soo Yeon! - Gosh, you startled me.

1084
00:50:34,594 --> 00:50:37,072
Why did you have to yell?

1085
00:50:37,364 --> 00:50:39,842
- You scared the heck out of me. - My goodness.

1086
00:50:40,063 --> 00:50:43,133
I scared the "heck" out of you?

1087
00:50:43,134 --> 00:50:47,033
How can someone who wants to be a reporter use such language?

1088
00:50:47,034 --> 00:50:48,343
Do you really think it's okay?

1089
00:50:48,344 --> 00:50:51,443
Gosh, there he goes again.

1090
00:50:51,444 --> 00:50:54,810
Do you think it's that easy to become a reporter?

1091
00:50:55,143 --> 00:50:57,013
Hey, knock it off.

1092
00:50:57,014 --> 00:51:00,522
Do you think this job is some kind of joke?

1093
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:03,029
Hey, knock it off!

1094
00:51:05,594 --> 00:51:08,223
Did you just slap me?

1095
00:51:08,224 --> 00:51:09,562
With that grilled fish?

1096
00:51:09,563 --> 00:51:11,470
Yes, I did.

1097
00:51:11,964 --> 00:51:14,482
You were getting on my nerves. What are you going to do?

1098
00:51:14,663 --> 00:51:17,284
Soo Yeon, what are you doing?

1099
00:51:17,703 --> 00:51:20,183
This jerk was asking for it.

1100
00:51:20,203 --> 00:51:24,019
Shut your mouth, you jerk. I hate you!

1101
00:51:25,773 --> 00:51:28,700
I can't let her get away with this one.

1102
00:51:28,913 --> 00:51:30,821
I'll fire her.

1103
00:51:30,944 --> 00:51:32,137
Sir.

1104
00:51:32,313 --> 00:51:34,455
Another glass with me?

1105
00:51:39,424 --> 00:51:41,708
Yu Ri, where are you going?

1106
00:51:42,194 --> 00:51:44,265
I'm going to look for a job.

1107
00:51:44,563 --> 00:51:47,286
A job? What about Yu Ri's Kitchen 31?

1108
00:51:47,663 --> 00:51:49,744
I still have to make a living.

1109
00:51:50,203 --> 00:51:52,478
I can't live off you guys forever.

1110
00:51:52,603 --> 00:51:54,541
Are you going back to the hotel you used to work at?

1111
00:51:54,674 --> 00:51:57,764
No. I don't think they'll accept me back anyway.

1112
00:51:58,313 --> 00:52:01,648
I'm thinking of asking my ex-colleagues first.

1113
00:52:03,183 --> 00:52:04,306
I'll see you guys later.

1114
00:52:04,384 --> 00:52:07,004
- See you. - See you.

1115
00:52:14,224 --> 00:52:16,468
Hello, Coach. What?

1116
00:52:18,733 --> 00:52:20,090
Oh, okay.

1117
00:52:21,034 --> 00:52:23,176
Thank you. Bye.

1118
00:52:25,773 --> 00:52:28,598
Why did the coach call you? He wants you back on the team?

1119
00:52:29,174 --> 00:52:30,295
No.

1120
00:52:31,643 --> 00:52:32,898
It's something else.

1121
00:52:34,174 --> 00:52:35,306
I'm sorry.

1122
00:52:35,483 --> 00:52:39,053
I'd love to hire you, but there's no vacancy in the kitchen right now.

1123
00:52:40,983 --> 00:52:42,310
I understand.

1124
00:52:43,623 --> 00:52:46,816
Can you at least give me Young Jin's phone number?

1125
00:52:47,324 --> 00:52:48,956
You want to ask Young Jin too?

1126
00:52:49,663 --> 00:52:52,292
Yu Ri, there's no point in asking others.

1127
00:52:52,293 --> 00:52:56,211
What? What do you mean?

1128
00:53:07,074 --> 00:53:08,267
Gosh, my head.

1129
00:53:09,714 --> 00:53:10,835
Woo Shik.

1130
00:53:14,014 --> 00:53:15,758
What happened to the producer?

1131
00:53:16,453 --> 00:53:19,483
Don't worry. I made him completely pass out.

1132
00:53:22,163 --> 00:53:24,235
Gosh, why is it so noisy?

1133
00:53:24,694 --> 00:53:26,122
Oh, Soo Yeon.

1134
00:53:26,933 --> 00:53:28,702
Who is this guy, by the way?

1135
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:31,998
What? He's my friend.

1136
00:53:32,074 --> 00:53:34,552
You've been drinking together all night. You don't remember?

1137
00:53:36,203 --> 00:53:37,642
I don't remember a thing.

1138
00:53:37,643 --> 00:53:40,326
See? I told you he doesn't remember anything.

1139
00:53:41,714 --> 00:53:44,343
I should really quit drinking.

1140
00:53:44,344 --> 00:53:47,271
Gosh, why are my lips burning?

1141
00:53:51,183 --> 00:53:52,417
What's up with my face?

1142
00:53:52,494 --> 00:53:54,871
What are these bruises? What happened?

1143
00:53:55,264 --> 00:53:58,432
What's the big deal if you got a "kizu" on your lips?

1144
00:53:58,433 --> 00:53:59,493
Stop fussing.

1145
00:53:59,494 --> 00:54:02,697
Did you just say "kizu"?

1146
00:54:03,163 --> 00:54:04,832
It's Japanese.

1147
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:06,914
Oh, you're right. I'm sorry.

1148
00:54:07,433 --> 00:54:08,573
It was a mistake.

1149
00:54:08,574 --> 00:54:10,849
How could you make such a mistake?

1150
00:54:11,244 --> 00:54:13,272
I didn't know you were such a careless person.

1151
00:54:13,273 --> 00:54:15,613
Gosh, he's getting out of line.

1152
00:54:15,614 --> 00:54:18,367
What did you learn in the Korean classes?

1153
00:54:18,514 --> 00:54:19,982
You better stop now.

1154
00:54:19,983 --> 00:54:24,165
Young people these days say things without thinking. It's a problem.

1155
00:54:25,724 --> 00:54:28,854
Knock it off, you jerk!

1156
00:54:30,994 --> 00:54:33,232
- Did you just hit me? - I did. What are you going to do?

1157
00:54:33,233 --> 00:54:36,670
With that pumpkin-flavored gummy stick you've been sucking on?

1158
00:54:36,703 --> 00:54:37,856
You know what?

1159
00:54:38,203 --> 00:54:41,372
You say such obnoxious things.

1160
00:54:41,373 --> 00:54:43,372
You humiliate people with your words.

1161
00:54:43,373 --> 00:54:47,073
That's why Soo Yeon hit you with that chicken foot.

1162
00:54:47,074 --> 00:54:48,164
What did you just say?

1163
00:54:48,344 --> 00:54:49,812
Soo Yeon hit me?

1164
00:54:49,813 --> 00:54:51,038
With a chicken foot?

1165
00:54:53,114 --> 00:54:54,682
Woo Shik, are you crazy?

1166
00:54:54,683 --> 00:54:56,826
Oh, right. It's supposed to be a secret.

1167
00:54:57,154 --> 00:55:00,214
Still, I won't tell him you hit him with a grilled fish too.

1168
00:55:01,194 --> 00:55:02,825
You hit me with a grilled fish too?

1169
00:55:12,659 --> 00:55:14,801
Wait. What are you doing here?

1170
00:55:16,029 --> 00:55:17,658
Why are you drinking alone?

1171
00:55:17,659 --> 00:55:19,945
Ki Bong.

1172
00:55:26,839 --> 00:55:28,747
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

1173
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:31,870
How much did you drink?

1174
00:55:33,009 --> 00:55:34,774
Were you able to find a job?

1175
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,693
No, I couldn't find any.

1176
00:55:39,049 --> 00:55:42,660
The hotel chef I used to work for...

1177
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:46,045
banned everyone from hiring me.

1178
00:55:46,989 --> 00:55:48,489
The thing is,

1179
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:53,206
I threw spaghetti at his face before I left.

1180
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:55,251
Why?

1181
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,693
I worked for him for 10 years.

1182
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:05,840
But he gave the sous-chef position...

1183
00:56:06,409 --> 00:56:08,858
to someone who had worked there less than five years.

1184
00:56:10,779 --> 00:56:14,624
I've never studied abroad, and I don't have an impressive background.

1185
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:18,177
He said it'd be embarrassing if I got the position.

1186
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:21,318
That's why I threw the spaghetti...

1187
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,968
Are you okay?

1188
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:31,964
I'm fine.

1189
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,548
If my ex-colleagues can't hire me,

1190
00:56:36,739 --> 00:56:39,698
I'll just find any kind of part-time job.

1191
00:56:40,109 --> 00:56:41,302
What about your dream?

1192
00:56:41,779 --> 00:56:44,024
Your dream has always been to open your own restaurant.

1193
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:50,948
How many people in the world...

1194
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:54,258
actually realize their dreams?

1195
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,593
I give up.

1196
00:56:57,629 --> 00:56:59,292
Are you sure you're okay with that?

1197
00:57:00,699 --> 00:57:03,148
Of course. I'm fine.

1198
00:57:04,299 --> 00:57:07,359
I'm really fine, so don't worry about me.

1199
00:57:17,179 --> 00:57:19,291
Yu Ri, look at me.

1200
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,241
Why?

1201
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,844
Hey.

1202
00:57:27,259 --> 00:57:29,528
What did you do?

1203
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:31,459
Don't you remember what you told me?

1204
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:32,990
You said I should cry if I want to.

1205
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:37,139
So don't hold it back. Cry if you want to.

1206
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,978
Ki Bong. What should I do now?

1207
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:51,808
I really wanted to make it work this time.

1208
00:57:55,589 --> 00:57:57,119
But now...

1209
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:00,950
I feel...

1210
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,275
I feel completely hopeless.

1211
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:12,342
What should I do now?

1212
00:58:23,279 --> 00:58:26,034
What should I do?

1213
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,458
Hey, Woo Shik.

1214
00:58:43,029 --> 00:58:45,069
Get ahold of yourself!

1215
00:58:47,339 --> 00:58:48,430
You're so heavy.

1216
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:57,384
Where is this? Am I home?

1217
00:58:58,819 --> 00:58:59,942
Soo Yeon.

1218
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:02,189
How did we get here?

1219
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:04,535
I brought you here. Me.

1220
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:07,984
Seriously, you were way too heavy.

1221
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,313
Really?

1222
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:12,158
Oh, what happened to the producer?

1223
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:13,383
Don't you remember?

1224
00:59:14,129 --> 00:59:17,628
You told him I slapped him with chicken feet and he went crazy.

1225
00:59:17,629 --> 00:59:18,691
Really?

1226
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:21,062
Don't worry.

1227
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:23,412
I took care of everything.

1228
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:25,878
Mister, get up. Get up!

1229
00:59:25,879 --> 00:59:27,778
What? What do you want?

1230
00:59:27,779 --> 00:59:29,878
It's time for us to close, so please leave.

1231
00:59:29,879 --> 00:59:31,104
Where am I?

1232
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:33,102
Why am I here?

1233
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:37,588
No matter how hard he tries, he won't remember.

1234
00:59:38,219 --> 00:59:40,708
Do you know how hard I tried to make him drink?

1235
00:59:41,759 --> 00:59:44,136
I'm sorry. It's all because of me.

1236
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,652
It's okay.

1237
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,919
I know you did it to help me.

1238
00:59:51,569 --> 00:59:53,369
Thanks for helping me.

1239
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:55,859
You don't have to thank me.

1240
00:59:56,670 --> 00:59:57,690
It's just...

1241
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:00,375
I always feel thankful to you.

1242
01:00:01,779 --> 01:00:04,604
You let me live here...

1243
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:08,995
and you always came to see me whenever I was in trouble.

1244
01:00:09,089 --> 01:00:10,447
Don't worry about it.

1245
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,478
I just did all that because I liked it.

1246
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:17,788
You liked it?

1247
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,081
It's just...

1248
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:22,850
When you smile, I feel happy too...

1249
01:00:22,969 --> 01:00:25,621
and when you're in pain, I'm in pain too.

1250
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:28,419
When you're sad, I feel sad too.

1251
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:31,498
When you're not near me,

1252
01:00:32,179 --> 01:00:35,923
I feel concerned and you're always on my mind.

1253
01:00:37,179 --> 01:00:39,189
Do you like me, by any chance?

1254
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:47,922
What's wrong with you?

1255
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:50,873
I was just kidding.

1256
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,592
I'm not kidding.

1257
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,063
Soo Yeon.

1258
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,455
I have something to tell you.

1259
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:10,810
That's so loud.

1260
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:14,530
Who is it so early in the morning?

1261
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,650
Hello?

1262
01:01:24,029 --> 01:01:25,528
Ki Bong. What?

1263
01:01:25,529 --> 01:01:27,628
Yu Ri, come outside for a second.

1264
01:01:27,629 --> 01:01:28,691
Hurry.

1265
01:01:30,069 --> 01:01:31,937
What is this about?

1266
01:01:33,299 --> 01:01:34,901
I'm so sleepy.

1267
01:01:35,069 --> 01:01:36,906
What does he want to see me for?

1268
01:01:40,879 --> 01:01:42,002
I feel dizzy.

1269
01:01:43,879 --> 01:01:44,930
Yu Ri.

1270
01:01:45,879 --> 01:01:49,519
Why are you calling me out so early in the morning?

1271
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,048
Come down. Hurry.

1272
01:01:51,049 --> 01:01:53,201
Gosh, this is so annoying.

1273
01:02:01,129 --> 01:02:02,149
What is that?

1274
01:02:09,609 --> 01:02:10,732
Ta-da!

1275
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,273
Ki Bong.

1276
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:23,241
I promised you I'd open a restaurant for you.

1277
01:02:23,890 --> 01:02:26,573
But I can't afford to open a real restaurant now.

1278
01:02:26,819 --> 01:02:28,522
I only had enough for a food truck.

1279
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:30,461
It's also a used truck.

1280
01:02:30,629 --> 01:02:33,485
Where did you get the money?

1281
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,538
Actually, I received my last salary yesterday.

1282
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,987
It's the last money I made as a baseball player.

1283
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:42,749
I wondered what I should do with that money...

1284
01:02:43,609 --> 01:02:45,098
and decided to invest in you.

1285
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:49,006
So you should work hard to make money and pay me back.

1286
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:52,545
Ki Bong.

1287
01:02:56,650 --> 01:02:58,352
Yu Ri, are you crying?

1288
01:02:58,489 --> 01:02:59,643
Thank you.

1289
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,803
Thank you so much, Ki Bong.

1290
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:06,483
No problem.

1291
01:03:06,629 --> 01:03:08,497
I was just keeping my promise.

1292
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,899
"A man's word is worth his weight in installments." Don't you know?

1293
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,266
Of course I do.

1294
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:16,207
"A man's word is worth his weight in installments." Definitely.

1295
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:23,588
Don't cry. Stop crying now.

1296
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:29,110
Woo Shik.

1297
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:30,610
Get up, dude.

1298
01:03:31,489 --> 01:03:32,581
Get up.

1299
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,088
Hey!

1300
01:03:35,089 --> 01:03:36,589
You scared me. Who are you?

1301
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:40,080
Jun Ki.

1302
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:42,928
How much did you drink last night?

1303
01:03:42,929 --> 01:03:45,317
What? I don't know, something came up.

1304
01:03:46,069 --> 01:03:47,569
My headache is killing me.

1305
01:03:48,969 --> 01:03:49,989
But...

1306
01:03:50,569 --> 01:03:52,446
I think something happened last night.

1307
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:55,300
Wait.

1308
01:03:56,210 --> 01:03:59,850
Soo Yeon. I have something to tell you.

1309
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:03,340
What is it?

1310
01:04:03,549 --> 01:04:04,844
To tell you the truth,

1311
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:08,187
I like you.

1312
01:04:10,659 --> 01:04:12,016
I like you very much.

1313
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,612
From the first moment we met,

1314
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,203
I've never forgotten you for a single moment.

1315
01:04:24,909 --> 01:04:26,165
I really mean it.

1316
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,488
What? Did you do something crazy last night?

1317
01:04:35,489 --> 01:04:36,816
Well, the thing is...

1318
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:38,921
I got drunk and told Soo Yeon...

1319
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:41,011
that I like her.

1320
01:04:41,159 --> 01:04:42,721
That you like her?

1321
01:04:43,489 --> 01:04:45,928
So, how did it go? What did Soo Yeon say?

1322
01:04:45,929 --> 01:04:48,001
I don't know. I don't remember after that.

1323
01:04:48,629 --> 01:04:50,769
Jun Ki, what should I do?

1324
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:52,330
You're such an idiot.

1325
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:21,978
(Welcome to Waikiki 2 / Eulachacha Waikiki 2)

1326
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:25,399
How long will you keep this up? Aren't you going to ask her out?

1327
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,798
He's a producer who joined recently.

1328
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:28,568
He was shooting a show at a shooting range...

1329
01:05:28,569 --> 01:05:29,669
and hurt his ear.

1330
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:31,908
Soo Yeon, I have something to say to you.

1331
01:05:31,909 --> 01:05:33,309
I can't hear anything.

1332
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:34,709
I'll work really hard...

1333
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:36,548
and pay Ki Bong back for his kindness.

1334
01:05:36,549 --> 01:05:37,678
Why do you look so down?

1335
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:40,278
My boss said he'd fire me if I don't sell a car within this week.

1336
01:05:40,279 --> 01:05:41,619
- I haven't sold one yet. - Rebecca.

1337
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:42,948
How about changing cars?

1338
01:05:42,949 --> 01:05:44,189
Please save Rebecca.

1339
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,289
What did you do until your car reached this state?

1340
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:48,258
Rebecca! Rebecca!
