1
00:00:11,202 --> 00:00:13,242
I like you, Mr. Cha.

2
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:15,431
What?

3
00:00:21,852 --> 00:00:23,585
I like you.

4
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:26,391
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

5
00:00:28,292 --> 00:00:29,780
I'll come back later.

6
00:00:35,231 --> 00:00:37,679
Soo Yeon. When did you come?

7
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:40,586
What? I just arrived.

8
00:00:40,862 --> 00:00:43,471
Soo Yeon. How did you come here?

9
00:00:43,472 --> 00:00:46,225
I was talking with Yu Ri on the phone, and heard you fainted.

10
00:00:46,642 --> 00:00:48,170
What happened?

11
00:00:48,171 --> 00:00:50,011
He came down with a severe fever...

12
00:00:50,012 --> 00:00:51,810
due to fatigue, and lost consciousness.

13
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:52,933
Really?

14
00:00:53,942 --> 00:00:55,512
You should've told me.

15
00:00:56,582 --> 00:00:57,836
This is my fault.

16
00:00:58,551 --> 00:01:00,357
It isn't your fault.

17
00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:02,255
So don't worry about it.

18
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:05,094
What about your presentation?

19
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:07,112
Well...

20
00:01:07,662 --> 00:01:10,491
Soo Yeon, I'm really okay,

21
00:01:10,492 --> 00:01:11,756
so you should go.

22
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:14,102
You said you had a really important presentation today.

23
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:15,593
You should go.

24
00:01:18,341 --> 00:01:19,361
Okay.

25
00:01:20,302 --> 00:01:21,536
Okay, I will.

26
00:01:51,272 --> 00:01:52,323
Yes, ma'am.

27
00:01:52,402 --> 00:01:54,371
Soo Yeon, what in the world happened?

28
00:01:54,372 --> 00:01:56,820
I'm sorry. Something urgent came up.

29
00:01:57,912 --> 00:01:59,411
What happened to the presentation?

30
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:00,780
I did it alone.

31
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:02,210
You know, our proposal...

32
00:02:03,682 --> 00:02:04,946
has been accepted!

33
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:08,038
The director wants to make this into a regular program.

34
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:09,991
I see.

35
00:02:09,992 --> 00:02:11,175
What is this reaction?

36
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:13,223
I thought you'd be extremely happy.

37
00:02:13,992 --> 00:02:15,767
No, of course I'm happy.

38
00:02:15,892 --> 00:02:18,861
Anyway, we have a lot of work to do, so come to the office. Okay?

39
00:02:18,862 --> 00:02:19,984
Okay, ma'am.

40
00:02:26,672 --> 00:02:32,731
(Goodbye, Waikiki)

41
00:02:36,351 --> 00:02:38,157
I wonder if Woo Shik is okay.

42
00:02:40,052 --> 00:02:42,031
Goodness, I feel so sick.

43
00:02:42,122 --> 00:02:46,060
How could that Min Jun guy even be good at drinking?

44
00:02:46,061 --> 00:02:47,490
I really don't like him.

45
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:49,521
I hate him, he's not my type.

46
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:54,959
Here, drink this.

47
00:02:55,172 --> 00:02:57,517
- What is this? - It's honey water.

48
00:02:57,571 --> 00:02:59,901
You said you should drink with a man to see how he is.

49
00:02:59,902 --> 00:03:01,510
You're the one who got drunk and carried home.

50
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:02,695
It serves you right!

51
00:03:03,112 --> 00:03:05,510
It's just because I wasn't feeling well yesterday.

52
00:03:05,511 --> 00:03:07,113
You and your mouth.

53
00:03:07,182 --> 00:03:08,436
Go on and drink this.

54
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:10,133
Thanks.

55
00:03:10,712 --> 00:03:13,151
So did you decide to date Min Jun?

56
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:15,320
Yes. I'm going to date him casually.

57
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:16,413
Casually?

58
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:18,820
You better be careful.

59
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:20,903
- It's hard to read a man's... - Shut it.

60
00:03:21,862 --> 00:03:23,494
You always have to be careful.

61
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:25,425
We're home.

62
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:27,130
Woo Shik, are you okay?

63
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:30,201
Yes. I received an IV and got some rest.

64
00:03:30,202 --> 00:03:31,253
I'm feeling better now.

65
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:32,829
I'll go to my room and get some rest.

66
00:03:33,302 --> 00:03:34,393
Go on.

67
00:03:37,172 --> 00:03:39,120
Woo Shik's face looks really bad.

68
00:03:39,381 --> 00:03:41,177
Is he still sick?

69
00:03:41,811 --> 00:03:43,443
Well, on top of that,

70
00:03:43,552 --> 00:03:46,745
something really unexpected happened.

71
00:03:47,182 --> 00:03:48,320
What happened?

72
00:03:48,321 --> 00:03:51,051
Min Ah told Woo Shik that she likes him.

73
00:03:51,052 --> 00:03:52,220
- What? - She likes him?

74
00:03:52,221 --> 00:03:54,090
Min Ah actually likes Woo Shik?

75
00:03:54,091 --> 00:03:55,560
- Yes. - I told you.

76
00:03:55,561 --> 00:03:57,224
I said something was fishy.

77
00:03:57,492 --> 00:03:59,399
So? What happened?

78
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,602
I don't know either.

79
00:04:02,172 --> 00:04:05,160
Woo Shik is feeling so down, so I couldn't even ask him.

80
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:11,801
Watch the stairs.

81
00:04:11,982 --> 00:04:13,040
Isn't it heavy?

82
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,887
No. The weather is wonderful today.

83
00:04:17,552 --> 00:04:19,250
I hope we have a lot of customers today...

84
00:04:19,251 --> 00:04:21,020
and we sell all these ingredients. Right, Yu Ri?

85
00:04:21,021 --> 00:04:22,091
Yes.

86
00:04:22,092 --> 00:04:24,421
- Let's have another great day. - Thanks, okay.

87
00:04:24,422 --> 00:04:25,543
Ki Bong!

88
00:04:27,321 --> 00:04:28,431
What brings you here?

89
00:04:28,432 --> 00:04:31,161
I wanted to thank you for helping me move the plant the other day,

90
00:04:31,162 --> 00:04:32,487
so I brought you some bread.

91
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:34,257
You didn't have to.

92
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,830
Thanks anyway. I'll enjoy the bread.

93
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:39,371
I told you to just talk casually to me.

94
00:04:39,372 --> 00:04:40,462
I'm much younger than you.

95
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:45,041
Even though you're younger than me, it's rude to just talk casually.

96
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:46,481
Just talk casually next time you see me.

97
00:04:46,482 --> 00:04:47,706
I'll be off, then!

98
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:51,444
Who is she?

99
00:04:51,722 --> 00:04:53,282
Oh, she's a new part-timer at the bakery.

100
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:56,374
And you helped her move a plant?

101
00:04:56,651 --> 00:04:59,060
I was buying some bread and felt bad when I saw her struggling alone,

102
00:04:59,061 --> 00:05:00,184
so I gave her a hand.

103
00:05:00,521 --> 00:05:01,857
Let's eat this as a snack later.

104
00:05:02,092 --> 00:05:04,172
- Let's go, Yu Ri. - Okay.

105
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:05,524
Oh, boy.

106
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:21,440
Oh, you're up early.

107
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:23,552
What? Yes.

108
00:05:24,552 --> 00:05:26,150
By the way, how are you feeling?

109
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:27,344
As you can see, I'm fine.

110
00:05:27,682 --> 00:05:31,191
Oh, right. How's work going?

111
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:33,832
- The proposal has been approved. - Seriously?

112
00:05:34,191 --> 00:05:36,130
That's great news. Congratulations, Soo Yeon.

113
00:05:36,662 --> 00:05:38,560
Thanks. I owe it all to you.

114
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:40,469
Gosh, I didn't even do anything.

115
00:05:40,831 --> 00:05:42,606
We should have a party to celebrate this.

116
00:05:43,131 --> 00:05:45,519
Today won't work because I have a recording.

117
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:47,785
Then let's have a party this weekend.

118
00:05:48,042 --> 00:05:49,140
Okay, let's do that.

119
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,742
Mr. Cha, I'm here.

120
00:05:52,612 --> 00:05:53,981
What brings you here this early?

121
00:05:53,982 --> 00:05:57,786
You seem to have gotten weak, so I'm here to nurture you.

122
00:05:58,052 --> 00:06:00,380
I'll fix you breakfast quickly, so give me a minute.

123
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:01,749
Hey, why are you being like this?

124
00:06:03,122 --> 00:06:04,448
- Min Ah. - Hold on.

125
00:06:05,821 --> 00:06:08,190
I hesitated for years before telling you how I feel about you.

126
00:06:08,191 --> 00:06:11,599
Shouldn't you ponder on it for three days before giving me your answer?

127
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:13,330
You see, it's...

128
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,209
Just go wash your hands.

129
00:06:15,472 --> 00:06:18,807
- Go on! - Okay, I heard you.

130
00:06:25,081 --> 00:06:26,407
I'm making quite a fuss, aren't I?

131
00:06:27,112 --> 00:06:28,274
Sorry?

132
00:06:29,782 --> 00:06:31,546
- No, you're not. - To tell you the truth,

133
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:34,372
I like Mr. Cha so much.

134
00:06:35,122 --> 00:06:38,794
I met him for the 1st time in 11th grade and fell for him right away.

135
00:06:39,122 --> 00:06:42,600
But I couldn't tell him how I felt about him because I was too young.

136
00:06:42,961 --> 00:06:45,450
This time, I had to muster up the courage to tell him.

137
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:48,238
So please help me out.

138
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:51,092
Okay?

139
00:06:54,141 --> 00:06:55,804
- Sure. - Thanks, Soo Yeon.

140
00:06:58,641 --> 00:06:59,866
Feel free to hang out here.

141
00:07:00,282 --> 00:07:01,678
I need to get ready for work.

142
00:07:02,581 --> 00:07:03,672
All right.

143
00:07:13,961 --> 00:07:16,001
- Be careful. - Okay, I will.

144
00:07:16,432 --> 00:07:17,513
All right.

145
00:07:20,461 --> 00:07:22,002
Yu Ri, good work today.

146
00:07:22,271 --> 00:07:24,475
You too. Good work, my boyfriend.

147
00:07:24,802 --> 00:07:27,087
What was that about? What if anyone sees that?

148
00:07:27,242 --> 00:07:29,282
Don't you know that Woo Shik will beat me up if he finds out?

149
00:07:30,271 --> 00:07:31,781
Gosh, you're such a chicken.

150
00:07:31,782 --> 00:07:33,445
It doesn't hurt to be careful.

151
00:07:39,482 --> 00:07:42,000
What's wrong? What's the text about?

152
00:07:43,691 --> 00:07:44,772
It's nothing.

153
00:07:45,162 --> 00:07:47,058
Yu Ri, I need to step out for a few minutes.

154
00:07:47,461 --> 00:07:48,654
Where do you have to go this late?

155
00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:50,990
I just want to get some fresh air.

156
00:07:51,432 --> 00:07:52,891
- I'll be right back. - What?

157
00:07:57,732 --> 00:07:59,608
He was outside all day.

158
00:07:59,672 --> 00:08:01,099
Why does he want to get fresh air again?

159
00:08:06,482 --> 00:08:08,694
Oh, right. What are you going to do?

160
00:08:08,912 --> 00:08:11,462
- About what? - Min Ah told you she likes you.

161
00:08:11,651 --> 00:08:12,750
Will you go out with her?

162
00:08:12,751 --> 00:08:14,221
What are you talking about?

163
00:08:14,222 --> 00:08:16,567
- She's just my student. - So what?

164
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:19,518
Hey, she's all grown up now. Why should that matter?

165
00:08:21,521 --> 00:08:22,685
Hang on.

166
00:08:23,492 --> 00:08:27,071
Don't tell me... Are you torn because of Soo Yeon?

167
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:28,424
No, it's not that!

168
00:08:29,071 --> 00:08:30,908
I'll sort it out, so mind your own business.

169
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:33,106
Why are you getting all mad at me?

170
00:08:36,612 --> 00:08:38,244
Look at you, Jung Eun!

171
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:41,459
What's going on? Where are you going all dressed up?

172
00:08:42,781 --> 00:08:44,581
I have a date with Min Jun. Are we good now?

173
00:08:44,582 --> 00:08:47,180
Again? You saw him last night. Must you see him again today?

174
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:48,691
Min Jun told me...

175
00:08:48,692 --> 00:08:51,171
that he misses me even when he's looking at me.

176
00:08:53,192 --> 00:08:54,385
Gosh, that's so cheesy.

177
00:08:55,631 --> 00:08:57,861
I guess some guys still say stuff like that to girls.

178
00:08:57,862 --> 00:09:00,044
What's your problem? I think it's so romantic and nice.

179
00:09:00,462 --> 00:09:03,030
I think Min Jun and I...

180
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:05,011
are meant to be together. It must be fate.

181
00:09:05,271 --> 00:09:06,801
Fate, my foot.

182
00:09:07,001 --> 00:09:10,439
Hey, this could get you in deep trouble if you aren't careful.

183
00:09:11,271 --> 00:09:14,140
Watch out. Be careful with men at all times, okay?

184
00:09:14,141 --> 00:09:17,416
Hey, you're the most dangerous one out of all the guys around me.

185
00:09:17,751 --> 00:09:19,251
- See you guys later! - Bye.

186
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:22,302
Hey! Don't follow him to a vacation house or any places like that!

187
00:09:22,391 --> 00:09:24,696
- And put your seat belt on! - Hey, enough!

188
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:26,390
Jung Eun is not a kid.

189
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:27,993
Are you jealous or what? How childish.

190
00:09:28,322 --> 00:09:29,587
Jealous, my foot.

191
00:09:29,832 --> 00:09:32,515
Hey, I'm just bored. That's all.

192
00:09:32,702 --> 00:09:35,601
I have no one to tease now that she's busy going out on dates.

193
00:09:35,602 --> 00:09:38,732
What? She can't even date because you get bored without her?

194
00:09:39,842 --> 00:09:41,534
Then you should date too.

195
00:09:41,712 --> 00:09:43,099
You can hang out with your girlfriend.

196
00:09:44,372 --> 00:09:45,666
I should, indeed.

197
00:09:46,641 --> 00:09:50,018
Right, I've been neglecting my love life.

198
00:09:51,312 --> 00:09:53,495
Okay, then I'm going to make sure...

199
00:09:53,651 --> 00:09:55,998
I meet the love of my life today.

200
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,159
Okay, this is a good spot.

201
00:10:00,362 --> 00:10:02,809
I will meet the love of my life right here.

202
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,225
Wait.

203
00:10:05,862 --> 00:10:08,686
Gosh, how can I find the woman who's going to be the love of my life?

204
00:10:10,431 --> 00:10:13,601
That's it. I'll count to three with my eyes closed.

205
00:10:13,602 --> 00:10:16,059
The first woman I see when I open my eyes will be the love of my life.

206
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:17,633
Nice, it's a great plan.

207
00:10:17,942 --> 00:10:19,063
Shall I give it a shot, then?

208
00:10:20,181 --> 00:10:21,303
One.

209
00:10:22,312 --> 00:10:23,535
Two.

210
00:10:24,911 --> 00:10:26,074
Three!

211
00:10:29,751 --> 00:10:30,874
I found her.

212
00:10:33,261 --> 00:10:34,961
- Excuse me. - Yes?

213
00:10:34,962 --> 00:10:37,614
I think we're meant to be.

214
00:10:37,732 --> 00:10:39,639
- Would you be my girlfriend? - Sorry?

215
00:10:40,702 --> 00:10:42,773
- Honey! - What? "Honey"?

216
00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:45,923
What's wrong, honey?

217
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,322
Did something happen?

218
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,958
This guy asked me to be his girlfriend.

219
00:10:50,112 --> 00:10:52,897
What? Is it true?

220
00:10:54,641 --> 00:10:57,201
Hello, would you be my girlfriend?

221
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:01,855
You have such beautiful leaves.

222
00:11:02,622 --> 00:11:04,692
- What the... - My gosh, he must be crazy.

223
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:06,119
Let's just go, honey.

224
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,383
My goodness.

225
00:11:07,521 --> 00:11:08,613
Oh, my...

226
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:12,801
Darn it. That could've been bad.

227
00:11:14,602 --> 00:11:15,652
I should try again.

228
00:11:16,872 --> 00:11:18,330
Okay, one more time.

229
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:20,562
One.

230
00:11:21,771 --> 00:11:22,863
Two.

231
00:11:23,911 --> 00:11:25,064
Three!

232
00:11:29,181 --> 00:11:30,335
It's destiny.

233
00:11:32,452 --> 00:11:35,889
Hello, I think we're meant to be.

234
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:37,621
Would you be my girlfriend?

235
00:11:37,622 --> 00:11:39,121
My gosh, seriously?

236
00:11:39,222 --> 00:11:40,854
I, too, thought this was meant to be.

237
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,124
- You did? - Yes.

238
00:11:43,362 --> 00:11:46,564
By any chance, do you know what Taoism is?

239
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:50,460
- Taoism? - You're plagued by bad luck.

240
00:11:50,531 --> 00:11:52,511
- Let's have a chat over there. - Sorry?

241
00:11:52,872 --> 00:11:55,311
No, please. I don't want to know more about it.

242
00:11:55,312 --> 00:11:57,148
Wait. Gosh, why is this woman so strong?

243
00:11:57,372 --> 00:11:58,739
Ki Bong, let's go and start...

244
00:11:59,742 --> 00:12:01,517
What? He's not here.

245
00:12:04,312 --> 00:12:05,708
Couldn't he make his bed?

246
00:12:13,761 --> 00:12:15,189
This is Ki Bong's phone.

247
00:12:18,661 --> 00:12:22,200
What? "I'll see you where we met last night"?

248
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:25,528
Who is Shiny?

249
00:12:26,942 --> 00:12:30,480
Could it be the part-timer at the bakery I saw yesterday?

250
00:12:31,072 --> 00:12:32,265
I feel refreshed.

251
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:33,540
Oh, what are you doing here?

252
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,918
Hey, there was a lot of dust on your phone.

253
00:12:37,911 --> 00:12:40,721
We have to get ready for work, so come out quickly.

254
00:12:40,722 --> 00:12:42,252
Okay, I will.

255
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:52,206
What's going on? Does it mean...

256
00:12:52,862 --> 00:12:54,289
Ki Bong is cheating on me?

257
00:12:56,702 --> 00:12:58,130
Gosh, no way.

258
00:12:59,401 --> 00:13:01,101
Why did you want to see me out of the blue?

259
00:13:01,102 --> 00:13:03,670
The thing is, I've listened to the recording.

260
00:13:03,671 --> 00:13:07,048
But the song you wrote doesn't seem to be right for Min Ah.

261
00:13:07,212 --> 00:13:09,410
It's unfortunate, but we've decided...

262
00:13:09,411 --> 00:13:11,726
not to include the song in this album.

263
00:13:12,381 --> 00:13:14,421
Well, I have no say in it.

264
00:13:14,651 --> 00:13:15,978
And that being said,

265
00:13:16,051 --> 00:13:19,325
I'm thinking it'd be nice to release the song as your single.

266
00:13:20,391 --> 00:13:22,591
Pardon me? What do you mean?

267
00:13:22,592 --> 00:13:26,437
In my opinion, the version that you sang is much better.

268
00:13:27,332 --> 00:13:29,065
Min Ah is totally fine with it,

269
00:13:29,131 --> 00:13:31,417
and the label has agreed as well.

270
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,969
What do you think?

271
00:13:59,202 --> 00:14:03,180
Darn it. I almost got dragged by that woman.

272
00:14:03,972 --> 00:14:06,420
Yes, all right. I'll try again...

273
00:14:06,842 --> 00:14:08,913
for one last time. This is the last time.

274
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,204
Even if the first person I see is a guy,

275
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:13,788
I'm going to accept it as my fate.

276
00:14:16,011 --> 00:14:17,204
Okay, good.

277
00:14:18,852 --> 00:14:19,872
One.

278
00:14:21,322 --> 00:14:24,150
Two. Please.

279
00:14:24,151 --> 00:14:25,243
Three.

280
00:14:30,531 --> 00:14:31,583
Gosh.

281
00:14:33,031 --> 00:14:36,030
Jung Eun. What are you doing here?

282
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,170
I was going home after meeting Min Jun,

283
00:14:38,171 --> 00:14:40,500
but I saw a familiar-looking idiot standing here.

284
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:41,827
Still,

285
00:14:41,901 --> 00:14:45,338
why did you have to show up here now, of all times?

286
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,280
- What are you talking about? - Whatever!

287
00:14:47,641 --> 00:14:49,243
You always get in my way.

288
00:14:51,251 --> 00:14:52,914
Why is he so upset?

289
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,657
Hey! Jun Ki!

290
00:15:08,771 --> 00:15:09,853
I'm back.

291
00:15:09,972 --> 00:15:11,460
You're early today.

292
00:15:11,572 --> 00:15:12,623
Yes.

293
00:15:13,072 --> 00:15:16,478
Soo Yeon, I want you to congratulate me on something.

294
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,670
You do? What is it?

295
00:15:18,671 --> 00:15:19,803
The thing is...

296
00:15:20,681 --> 00:15:21,880
I'm releasing an album.

297
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:23,211
- Really? - Yes.

298
00:15:23,212 --> 00:15:25,730
The company wants me to sing...

299
00:15:26,122 --> 00:15:27,580
the song I wrote.

300
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:29,283
They'll release it as a single.

301
00:15:30,151 --> 00:15:31,723
Congratulations, Woo Shik.

302
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,831
That's great. That's really great.

303
00:15:33,992 --> 00:15:35,083
Mr. Cha.

304
00:15:36,862 --> 00:15:37,952
Min Ah.

305
00:15:38,031 --> 00:15:39,430
I heard the news.

306
00:15:39,431 --> 00:15:41,747
We should celebrate.

307
00:15:42,131 --> 00:15:44,171
Ta-da. Let's have a party.

308
00:15:44,332 --> 00:15:46,034
Okay. Let's do it.

309
00:15:52,112 --> 00:15:53,611
If your album becomes a success,

310
00:15:53,612 --> 00:15:55,650
you have to let me feature your song sometime.

311
00:15:55,651 --> 00:15:57,111
I get it.

312
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:01,472
By the way, I'm sorry.

313
00:16:01,582 --> 00:16:03,290
Don't be.

314
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,281
Your version sounded way better to my ears too.

315
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:09,430
So don't worry about it. Let's drink.

316
00:16:09,431 --> 00:16:10,961
Thanks.

317
00:16:10,962 --> 00:16:12,052
Cheers.

318
00:16:16,872 --> 00:16:18,606
I already finished my beer.

319
00:16:19,102 --> 00:16:20,400
Do we have more?

320
00:16:20,401 --> 00:16:21,463
Soo Yeon.

321
00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:24,441
You're getting drunk. Why don't you stop here?

322
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,552
No. Don't worry.

323
00:16:26,712 --> 00:16:28,007
I'm totally fine.

324
00:16:28,641 --> 00:16:29,773
I'm okay.

325
00:16:30,982 --> 00:16:32,032
I'm okay.

326
00:16:32,381 --> 00:16:33,544
I'm back.

327
00:16:33,622 --> 00:16:34,642
You're back.

328
00:16:34,982 --> 00:16:37,550
What's that bouquet? Is it from your boyfriend?

329
00:16:37,551 --> 00:16:39,500
No. I bought it for you.

330
00:16:39,692 --> 00:16:42,038
I heard you're releasing an album. Congratulations, Woo Shik.

331
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:45,213
Thanks.

332
00:16:46,261 --> 00:16:48,444
What happened to Soo Yeon?

333
00:16:49,602 --> 00:16:51,814
She drank beer too fast. She got drunk.

334
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:54,871
Jung Eun, will you take her to her room...

335
00:16:54,872 --> 00:16:55,871
and lay her on the bed?

336
00:16:55,872 --> 00:16:56,892
Sure.

337
00:16:57,411 --> 00:16:59,726
Soo Yeon. Soo Yeon.

338
00:17:03,151 --> 00:17:04,681
Jung Eun, you're back.

339
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:06,551
Let's have another drink then.

340
00:17:06,552 --> 00:17:08,621
You're drunk. You shouldn't drink more.

341
00:17:08,622 --> 00:17:10,690
- Let's go in. - I'm totally okay.

342
00:17:10,691 --> 00:17:11,990
I can drink more.

343
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:14,644
Let's go in. Come.

344
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:15,831
Why don't you drink...

345
00:17:15,832 --> 00:17:17,291
Let's just go in.

346
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:18,893
Be careful. There you go.

347
00:17:19,631 --> 00:17:21,192
I'm really okay.

348
00:17:21,532 --> 00:17:23,700
I can drink more.

349
00:17:23,701 --> 00:17:25,740
You're already drunk. You shouldn't drink more.

350
00:17:25,741 --> 00:17:26,823
Just go to bed.

351
00:17:28,102 --> 00:17:30,240
- Hold on. - Why are you getting up?

352
00:17:30,241 --> 00:17:32,424
I have something to tell Woo Shik.

353
00:17:33,241 --> 00:17:34,639
I have to tell him.

354
00:17:35,312 --> 00:17:37,494
Why don't you sleep now and tell him tomorrow?

355
00:17:37,582 --> 00:17:38,978
I can't.

356
00:17:39,822 --> 00:17:41,658
I have to tell him right now.

357
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:45,150
Otherwise, I might never be able to.

358
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:47,262
Come on. You can tell him tomorrow.

359
00:17:47,991 --> 00:17:49,083
No.

360
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:51,684
I have to tell him right now.

361
00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:53,883
I'm telling him.

362
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,430
Why are you doing this?

363
00:17:55,431 --> 00:17:58,831
Let go of me. I have something to tell Woo Shik.

364
00:17:58,832 --> 00:18:00,841
You're too drunk. Tell him tomorrow.

365
00:18:00,842 --> 00:18:02,127
I can't.

366
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,571
I have to tell him right now, Jung Eun.

367
00:18:04,572 --> 00:18:06,611
You're drunk. Just go to bed and tell him tomorrow.

368
00:18:06,612 --> 00:18:08,180
I can't. I have to tell him.

369
00:18:08,181 --> 00:18:09,811
You drank too much.

370
00:18:09,812 --> 00:18:10,832
Do it tomorrow.

371
00:18:12,651 --> 00:18:15,885
Why did Jung Eun show up right at that moment?

372
00:18:16,592 --> 00:18:19,856
Could she be my destiny?

373
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:22,722
No way.

374
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:27,960
What can I do

375
00:18:27,961 --> 00:18:31,266
To make you smile?

376
00:18:31,802 --> 00:18:33,536
I recorded this a while ago.

377
00:18:33,802 --> 00:18:34,893
How does it sound?

378
00:18:37,612 --> 00:18:39,311
Jun Ki. Hey!

379
00:18:39,312 --> 00:18:41,480
What? What did you say?

380
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:43,111
What do you think of this song?

381
00:18:43,112 --> 00:18:44,846
- What? - You weren't listening?

382
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,153
I was.

383
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:48,905
I like it.

384
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:51,736
It's the best song you've ever made.

385
00:18:52,191 --> 00:18:54,405
- You really think so? - Yes.

386
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:55,891
The best thing about this song...

387
00:18:55,961 --> 00:18:57,970
is the lyrics.

388
00:18:58,461 --> 00:19:01,766
Did you think about Soo Yeon while writing them?

389
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:02,900
Did you?

390
00:19:02,901 --> 00:19:03,900
What?

391
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:06,288
I can see it in your face.

392
00:19:06,741 --> 00:19:09,311
Do you still have feelings for Soo Yeon?

393
00:19:09,312 --> 00:19:10,638
I don't.

394
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:14,938
She and I are just friends now.

395
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,295
- Are you sure? - Yes.

396
00:19:17,352 --> 00:19:19,258
Don't ever say things like that in front of Soo Yeon.

397
00:19:19,352 --> 00:19:20,781
It'll make her uncomfortable.

398
00:19:20,782 --> 00:19:22,108
I get it.

399
00:19:22,352 --> 00:19:24,390
I'm glad you got over her.

400
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:26,157
You suffered a lot because of her.

401
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:40,568
Thank you for today.

402
00:19:41,042 --> 00:19:43,271
Thank you.

403
00:19:43,272 --> 00:19:45,178
Let's clean up quickly and get some rest.

404
00:19:51,451 --> 00:19:52,502
What's wrong?

405
00:19:52,981 --> 00:19:54,174
What does it say?

406
00:19:55,921 --> 00:19:57,012
Nothing.

407
00:19:57,522 --> 00:19:59,791
I have to be somewhere for a moment.

408
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:01,261
You can go in and rest.

409
00:20:01,262 --> 00:20:03,168
I'll clean up everything when I'm back, okay?

410
00:20:03,362 --> 00:20:04,962
Where are you going again?

411
00:20:06,102 --> 00:20:07,530
I just want some fresh air.

412
00:20:07,802 --> 00:20:08,923
See you.

413
00:20:13,072 --> 00:20:14,092
What's going on?

414
00:20:14,471 --> 00:20:17,838
Is he meeting that bakery girl called Shiny or something?

415
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:20,809
Ki Bong, you jerk.

416
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,245
You're dead meat.

417
00:20:26,151 --> 00:20:29,038
Where did he go?

418
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:31,231
I can't find him anywhere in the neighborhood.

419
00:20:31,592 --> 00:20:33,357
I'll teach him a lesson today.

420
00:20:38,391 --> 00:20:40,065
That jerk.

421
00:20:45,532 --> 00:20:46,593
Hey, Ki Bong!

422
00:20:47,342 --> 00:20:48,422
Yu Ri.

423
00:20:48,901 --> 00:20:50,982
- What are you doing here? - Who's this girl?

424
00:20:51,141 --> 00:20:52,371
Who is she?

425
00:20:52,372 --> 00:20:54,581
"Girl"? What are you talking about?

426
00:20:54,582 --> 00:20:55,611
Don't get cute with me.

427
00:20:55,612 --> 00:20:57,243
She's that girl from the bakery, isn't she?

428
00:20:58,282 --> 00:20:59,343
Who are you?

429
00:21:00,951 --> 00:21:01,971
Who...

430
00:21:08,122 --> 00:21:10,376
You're the baseball coach?

431
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:12,031
Hello.

432
00:21:12,032 --> 00:21:14,244
Hello.

433
00:21:14,802 --> 00:21:16,739
I can't believe you.

434
00:21:16,971 --> 00:21:19,796
You ran here thinking I'm cheating on you?

435
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:21,193
Well...

436
00:21:22,002 --> 00:21:24,010
You kept disappearing at night.

437
00:21:27,012 --> 00:21:28,204
That's strange.

438
00:21:29,181 --> 00:21:32,251
I definitely saw a text from Shiny.

439
00:21:32,252 --> 00:21:33,444
Is that what made you suspicious?

440
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:35,480
It was from the coach.

441
00:21:35,481 --> 00:21:36,511
What?

442
00:21:36,852 --> 00:21:38,452
Shiny is the coach?

443
00:21:39,092 --> 00:21:40,143
Why?

444
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:45,012
What?

445
00:21:45,802 --> 00:21:47,801
Ki Bong, you saved me...

446
00:21:47,802 --> 00:21:49,504
as Shiny in your phone?

447
00:21:49,772 --> 00:21:51,404
You punk.

448
00:21:52,671 --> 00:21:55,496
I'm sorry. It's your nickname.

449
00:21:59,141 --> 00:22:01,936
Why were you meeting the coach at this hour anyway?

450
00:22:03,481 --> 00:22:04,533
Well...

451
00:22:05,151 --> 00:22:08,480
He's been asking me if I want to become a batter.

452
00:22:08,481 --> 00:22:09,543
A batter?

453
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:13,070
Does that mean you can play baseball again?

454
00:22:13,221 --> 00:22:16,061
Of course. He's a pitcher,

455
00:22:16,062 --> 00:22:18,784
but he was a cleanup hitter back in high school.

456
00:22:18,832 --> 00:22:22,670
I think he's too good to give up baseball altogether.

457
00:22:22,671 --> 00:22:24,569
That's why I've been trying to persuade him.

458
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:27,395
But he won't change his mind.

459
00:22:28,302 --> 00:22:30,249
I'm not interested in baseball anymore.

460
00:22:30,671 --> 00:22:32,069
Please stop coming here.

461
00:22:33,381 --> 00:22:34,401
Let's go.

462
00:22:36,381 --> 00:22:37,432
Hey, Ki Bong!

463
00:22:38,782 --> 00:22:39,873
Ki Bong!

464
00:22:51,191 --> 00:22:53,303
I'll wash up all the tools.

465
00:22:53,401 --> 00:22:55,031
You can go to bed.

466
00:22:55,032 --> 00:22:56,123
Okay.

467
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:58,756
Wait, Ki Bong.

468
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:03,170
Are you sure you don't want to play baseball again?

469
00:23:03,171 --> 00:23:04,232
What?

470
00:23:06,141 --> 00:23:07,161
Yes.

471
00:23:07,881 --> 00:23:09,789
I just want to run our food truck with you.

472
00:23:09,951 --> 00:23:12,311
We have to work hard to start another branch...

473
00:23:12,312 --> 00:23:13,708
and even go abroad, remember?

474
00:23:15,221 --> 00:23:16,375
You're lying.

475
00:23:16,852 --> 00:23:18,251
I know...

476
00:23:18,252 --> 00:23:20,404
you put on that stupid smile when you're lying.

477
00:23:21,921 --> 00:23:24,542
You still want to play baseball, don't you?

478
00:23:25,661 --> 00:23:27,641
What is it? Are you afraid?

479
00:23:28,131 --> 00:23:29,498
Of failing again?

480
00:23:32,002 --> 00:23:33,124
Hold on.

481
00:23:33,201 --> 00:23:35,690
Is my boyfriend such a coward?

482
00:23:36,112 --> 00:23:39,202
If I want to break up with you,

483
00:23:39,411 --> 00:23:40,781
you won't even stop me, right?

484
00:23:40,782 --> 00:23:42,311
You'll be too scared of being turned down, won't you?

485
00:23:42,312 --> 00:23:43,551
That's not true.

486
00:23:43,552 --> 00:23:46,509
As if. Now there's a way to play baseball again,

487
00:23:46,852 --> 00:23:48,452
but you're hesitating because you're afraid.

488
00:23:50,092 --> 00:23:53,591
Should I really keep seeing this coward?

489
00:23:53,792 --> 00:23:55,291
Switching to batting...

490
00:23:55,322 --> 00:23:57,473
is not as easy as you think.

491
00:23:58,491 --> 00:23:59,553
Is that so?

492
00:24:00,502 --> 00:24:02,399
Then forget it.

493
00:24:02,971 --> 00:24:05,684
And let's break up.

494
00:24:05,802 --> 00:24:06,822
What?

495
00:24:08,002 --> 00:24:09,571
Where is this coming from?

496
00:24:09,572 --> 00:24:11,988
I don't want a coward as my boyfriend.

497
00:24:12,782 --> 00:24:14,270
This has been fun.

498
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:18,734
What's with you?

499
00:24:19,151 --> 00:24:21,294
I can't. I can never break up with you.

500
00:24:21,582 --> 00:24:22,602
Then...

501
00:24:28,522 --> 00:24:29,817
Play baseball again.

502
00:24:31,032 --> 00:24:33,817
I'll support you in any way I can.

503
00:24:35,002 --> 00:24:38,133
Instead of a coward as my boyfriend,

504
00:24:38,872 --> 00:24:40,228
I prefer a man who can keep trying...

505
00:24:40,741 --> 00:24:43,464
until the end to achieve his dream, although it may be difficult.

506
00:24:44,042 --> 00:24:45,775
That will make me much more proud.

507
00:24:46,112 --> 00:24:47,264
Ki Bong.

508
00:24:48,911 --> 00:24:50,075
Don't be afraid.

509
00:24:51,211 --> 00:24:52,783
You have me beside you.

510
00:24:53,622 --> 00:24:55,081
Like I always said,

511
00:24:55,991 --> 00:24:57,859
all you have to do is trust me.

512
00:24:58,852 --> 00:24:59,983
Okay?

513
00:25:01,562 --> 00:25:02,786
Thank you, Yu Ri.

514
00:25:03,532 --> 00:25:04,684
Thank you so much.

515
00:25:07,231 --> 00:25:08,934
Why are you so lovely?

516
00:25:09,731 --> 00:25:10,823
Really?

517
00:25:11,772 --> 00:25:13,812
You're so lovely, and I can't stand it anymore.

518
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:17,155
- I really can't stand it. - What?

519
00:25:40,161 --> 00:25:42,446
What? You decided to play baseball again?

520
00:25:42,502 --> 00:25:44,439
Yes. I'll switch to a hitter.

521
00:25:45,131 --> 00:25:46,440
Although it won't be easy.

522
00:25:46,441 --> 00:25:48,170
That's why you look so happy today.

523
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,041
Does it make you that happy thinking about playing baseball?

524
00:25:50,042 --> 00:25:51,979
Yes. I'm happy. I truly am.

525
00:25:52,411 --> 00:25:56,012
Good. Since you made up your mind, play hard and make it to the 1st...

526
00:25:56,082 --> 00:25:58,351
No, make it to the major league.

527
00:25:58,352 --> 00:25:59,882
Thanks. I'll try my best.

528
00:26:03,752 --> 00:26:05,291
Yu Ri, why aren't you eating?

529
00:26:05,292 --> 00:26:07,229
What? I don't know.

530
00:26:07,522 --> 00:26:09,704
I'm not feeling well today.

531
00:26:09,762 --> 00:26:11,394
I think I have a fever too.

532
00:26:11,461 --> 00:26:13,339
I feel chilly, and maybe I'm coming down with a cold.

533
00:26:14,062 --> 00:26:16,200
Really? Then we should go to a hospital right now.

534
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:18,331
No, I'll feel better if I take some medicine.

535
00:26:18,332 --> 00:26:20,789
What are you talking about? Do you know how scary colds are?

536
00:26:21,471 --> 00:26:23,205
Get ready and let's go to the hospital. Get up.

537
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:24,797
- I'm fine. - Be careful.

538
00:26:25,112 --> 00:26:26,468
- Can you walk? - Yes.

539
00:26:26,542 --> 00:26:28,173
Gosh, I'm so worried.

540
00:26:29,681 --> 00:26:31,855
- Why is he overreacting so much? - I know.

541
00:26:32,921 --> 00:26:35,064
Don't those two seem kind of fishy lately?

542
00:26:35,522 --> 00:26:37,021
Did they fall in love while working together?

543
00:26:37,022 --> 00:26:38,928
What? Ki Bong and my sister?

544
00:26:39,122 --> 00:26:40,212
Are you crazy?

545
00:26:40,362 --> 00:26:42,361
How could you say something so horrible?

546
00:26:42,661 --> 00:26:44,325
I was just joking.

547
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:48,720
- Excuse me. - Yes. May I help you?

548
00:26:48,802 --> 00:26:51,893
Actually, my wallet has gone missing from my room.

549
00:26:51,971 --> 00:26:54,859
- What? - It was there when I went to sleep,

550
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:56,850
but it was gone when I woke up in the morning.

551
00:26:57,042 --> 00:26:58,775
Really? What should we do?

552
00:27:04,151 --> 00:27:06,281
When did you last see your wallet?

553
00:27:06,282 --> 00:27:08,420
I think it was around 11pm.

554
00:27:08,421 --> 00:27:10,901
Then we should start searching after that time.

555
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:19,924
It's Ki Bong and Yu Ri.

556
00:27:23,572 --> 00:27:26,836
What? What are they talking about so seriously at night?

557
00:27:28,441 --> 00:27:31,470
Wait. Why are they holding hands?

558
00:27:42,522 --> 00:27:45,791
What is this? What is this jerk doing with my sister?

559
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,373
- It looks like they're kissing. - Kissing?

560
00:27:53,431 --> 00:27:54,686
Guys, we're going to the hospital.

561
00:27:57,572 --> 00:27:58,724
What?

562
00:28:00,102 --> 00:28:01,397
Why are you staring at me like that?

563
00:28:04,112 --> 00:28:06,284
You. You...

564
00:28:07,342 --> 00:28:09,657
You... How could you...

565
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,222
What are you saying? What's wrong?

566
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:23,093
Ki Bong. Explain what this is about.

567
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,782
I said, explain what this is about!

568
00:28:27,901 --> 00:28:29,666
Woo Shik, please calm down.

569
00:28:30,171 --> 00:28:32,476
Cut it and just tell me.

570
00:28:32,971 --> 00:28:34,501
Tell me now!

571
00:28:38,711 --> 00:28:41,129
Brother. Calm down.

572
00:28:43,082 --> 00:28:44,887
Okay. I'll be honest with you.

573
00:28:46,151 --> 00:28:49,792
Ki Bong and I are in a relationship.

574
00:28:50,421 --> 00:28:52,125
We were just kissing. So what?

575
00:28:52,391 --> 00:28:54,258
- Is that wrong? - What?

576
00:28:54,921 --> 00:28:56,726
You two are really dating?

577
00:28:57,131 --> 00:28:58,315
Yes.

578
00:28:58,562 --> 00:29:00,193
I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Woo Shik.

579
00:29:05,431 --> 00:29:06,564
You can hit me if you want to.

580
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:07,996
I'll let you hit me all you want.

581
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:11,472
Still, I'll never give up on Yu Ri, so keep that in mind.

582
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:15,938
Here, hit me. Hit me until you don't feel angry anymore.

583
00:29:17,681 --> 00:29:19,079
No, no!

584
00:29:25,691 --> 00:29:26,814
No!

585
00:29:36,201 --> 00:29:39,536
Thank you, my friend. Thank you so much.

586
00:29:39,802 --> 00:29:40,893
What?

587
00:29:42,901 --> 00:29:43,992
What do you mean?

588
00:29:44,342 --> 00:29:45,611
Does that mean you'll approve?

589
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:46,867
Of course.

590
00:29:47,082 --> 00:29:50,957
I should be grateful to you for meeting a girl like my sister.

591
00:29:53,221 --> 00:29:54,821
- What? - I was wondering...

592
00:29:54,822 --> 00:29:58,188
how long I had to take care of this brat, and it always made me upset.

593
00:29:58,622 --> 00:30:00,907
But you have taken care of all my worries.

594
00:30:01,461 --> 00:30:02,645
Thank you, my friend.

595
00:30:03,062 --> 00:30:04,183
What did you say?

596
00:30:04,332 --> 00:30:06,561
Brother. How could you say something so harsh?

597
00:30:06,562 --> 00:30:07,928
It's not harsh at all.

598
00:30:08,262 --> 00:30:11,230
A kind and innocent guy like Ki Bong is dating you.

599
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:14,200
I'm so grateful, and I just want to bow down to him right now.

600
00:30:14,201 --> 00:30:15,569
- Let me bow to you. - It's okay.

601
00:30:16,102 --> 00:30:18,591
Brother. How could you say that...

602
00:30:20,481 --> 00:30:22,756
- I feel dizzy. - Yu Ri!

603
00:30:34,362 --> 00:30:35,483
Ki Bong.

604
00:30:36,631 --> 00:30:39,417
- Yu Ri, are you feeling better? - Yes.

605
00:30:40,161 --> 00:30:41,966
What happened to me?

606
00:30:42,102 --> 00:30:45,162
I don't know. Woo Shik went to talk to the doctor right now.

607
00:30:46,572 --> 00:30:48,841
Sorry? What did you say?

608
00:30:48,842 --> 00:30:49,963
She's pregnant.

609
00:30:50,072 --> 00:30:51,970
Ms. Cha Yu Ri is pregnant.

610
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:53,849
Pregnant... Pregnant?

611
00:30:53,941 --> 00:30:55,920
Does that mean a baby is...

612
00:30:56,752 --> 00:30:58,750
- growing inside my sister's belly? - Yes.

613
00:31:08,161 --> 00:31:11,061
Still, since Woo Shik gave his permission,

614
00:31:11,062 --> 00:31:14,001
we'll be able to date comfortably now, right?

615
00:31:14,002 --> 00:31:15,124
That's right.

616
00:31:15,431 --> 00:31:17,574
I thought Woo Shik would beat me to death if he found out.

617
00:31:18,072 --> 00:31:20,826
If I knew he'd react like that, I should've told him earlier.

618
00:31:22,002 --> 00:31:23,644
I was so worried about you.

619
00:31:34,181 --> 00:31:35,885
You're back. What did the doctor say?

620
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:38,165
- When did you start dating? - What?

621
00:31:39,762 --> 00:31:42,954
- Why are you suddenly asking... - Just answer my question.

622
00:31:43,891 --> 00:31:45,186
What's wrong? You're scaring me.

623
00:31:45,832 --> 00:31:48,483
Do you think it's time for you to smile right now, you jerk?

624
00:31:50,002 --> 00:31:52,276
- What's wrong, Woo Shik? - Do you not...

625
00:31:52,701 --> 00:31:54,680
Do you not know why, you jerk?

626
00:31:54,802 --> 00:31:57,170
- How could you do this to Yu Ri? - Woo Shik...

627
00:31:57,171 --> 00:31:58,511
- What's wrong? - Brother.

628
00:31:58,512 --> 00:32:00,480
Die! I'll kill you!

629
00:32:00,741 --> 00:32:02,139
- Just die! - Oh, gosh.

630
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,710
Woo Shik, what's the matter with you?

631
00:32:05,881 --> 00:32:06,972
- You jerk. - No!

632
00:32:08,022 --> 00:32:09,103
I'm bleeding.

633
00:32:09,852 --> 00:32:11,321
- Woo Shik! - No!

634
00:32:12,292 --> 00:32:14,057
- Die! Die! - Stop!

635
00:32:14,191 --> 00:32:15,291
Die!

636
00:32:15,292 --> 00:32:16,791
My brother-in-law, stop!

637
00:32:18,891 --> 00:32:21,278
Brother-in-law?

638
00:32:22,731 --> 00:32:23,854
Come here.

00:32:44,092 --> 00:32:45,551
Ki. There you go.

642
00:32:46,352 --> 00:32:47,790
Here you are.

643
00:32:48,562 --> 00:32:51,143
- Thank you. - Take care.

644
00:32:53,562 --> 00:32:56,357
Hey. Can you please shorten your autograph?

645
00:32:56,572 --> 00:32:58,102
Even looking at you makes me feel tired.

646
00:32:58,401 --> 00:33:00,101
I've already shortened it though.

647
00:33:00,102 --> 00:33:02,970
Really? You should shorten it more if you don't want to...

648
00:33:02,971 --> 00:33:04,063
lose your remaining fans.

649
00:33:05,272 --> 00:33:06,434
I'll consider it.

650
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:10,575
Excuse me.

651
00:33:10,681 --> 00:33:12,793
Mr. Lee Jun Ki? Do you have time to talk?

652
00:33:13,322 --> 00:33:16,554
- Do you want an autograph? - No, it's okay.

653
00:33:16,651 --> 00:33:18,456
Then what brings you here?

654
00:33:21,822 --> 00:33:24,761
- I'm a movie director, Park In Ha. - Oh, yes.

655
00:33:24,762 --> 00:33:27,005
I'm about to produce a movie soon,

656
00:33:27,302 --> 00:33:30,056
- and I'd like to work with you. - What?

657
00:33:30,701 --> 00:33:32,160
- With me? - Yes.

658
00:33:32,372 --> 00:33:34,071
It's a small independent film,

659
00:33:34,072 --> 00:33:37,233
but you're just the person who I was thinking of as the lead.

660
00:33:37,372 --> 00:33:38,871
I really like your acting too.

661
00:33:40,211 --> 00:33:41,303
The lead?

662
00:33:44,852 --> 00:33:46,993
Ki Bong. What will you do now?

663
00:33:47,352 --> 00:33:49,187
What will you do about my sister?

664
00:33:55,322 --> 00:33:57,913
Why aren't you saying anything? Say something.

665
00:33:58,292 --> 00:34:01,259
- Brother. Stop it and calm down. - What?

666
00:34:01,602 --> 00:34:03,877
- Do you expect me to calm down? - Cha Woo Shik.

667
00:34:04,332 --> 00:34:05,831
Stop making a fuss and shut your mouth.

668
00:34:10,312 --> 00:34:12,688
Ki Bong, get up.

669
00:34:13,882 --> 00:34:15,065
This isn't your fault.

670
00:34:16,812 --> 00:34:18,791
I don't want to pressure you.

671
00:34:19,951 --> 00:34:21,206
So don't worry.

672
00:34:22,152 --> 00:34:23,172
Okay?

673
00:34:29,161 --> 00:34:30,181
Yu Ri.

674
00:34:35,232 --> 00:34:37,272
- What? - Just a moment.

675
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:43,311
What's going on? What's with him?

676
00:34:43,312 --> 00:34:44,433
I'm not sure.

677
00:34:52,411 --> 00:34:53,503
Yu Ri.

678
00:34:55,122 --> 00:34:56,345
Marry me.

679
00:34:57,891 --> 00:34:58,972
What?

680
00:34:59,721 --> 00:35:01,628
I know that I'm dumb...

681
00:35:02,462 --> 00:35:03,717
and immature.

682
00:35:04,391 --> 00:35:05,585
I don't have a bright future ahead,

683
00:35:06,132 --> 00:35:07,834
and I can't get anything done right,

684
00:35:08,902 --> 00:35:10,361
but I'll make you happy forever.

685
00:35:10,971 --> 00:35:12,400
I'm confident that I can do it.

686
00:35:13,672 --> 00:35:14,864
Ki Bong.

687
00:35:20,181 --> 00:35:23,343
I received this ring when I won the high school championship.

688
00:35:24,611 --> 00:35:26,590
This is all I can give you at the moment,

689
00:35:27,122 --> 00:35:28,780
but I'll work hard from now on...

690
00:35:28,781 --> 00:35:31,647
so that I can buy a beautiful ring for each of your fingers.

691
00:35:34,391 --> 00:35:35,513
Cha Yu Ri.

692
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:37,986
Marry me.

693
00:35:55,741 --> 00:35:56,833
Ki Bong.

694
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:06,332
Does this mean you'll marry me?

695
00:36:08,221 --> 00:36:09,241
Yes.

696
00:36:11,832 --> 00:36:12,912
Thank you, Yu Ri.

697
00:36:13,531 --> 00:36:15,133
I'll make you happy from now on.

698
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:34,573
So Ki Bong and Yu Ri will get married?

699
00:36:34,752 --> 00:36:36,007
I can't believe it.

700
00:36:36,792 --> 00:36:38,351
Jung Eun! I have big news.

701
00:36:38,352 --> 00:36:40,061
Jun Ki, I have big news for you too!

702
00:36:40,062 --> 00:36:42,510
What? Big news?

703
00:36:42,692 --> 00:36:44,461
- Did something happen? - Hey, you know what?

704
00:36:44,462 --> 00:36:46,634
Yu Ri and Ki Bong are in a relationship.

705
00:36:47,502 --> 00:36:49,401
- Come again? - There's more.

706
00:36:49,402 --> 00:36:51,871
Yu Ri is pregnant.

707
00:36:51,872 --> 00:36:54,115
- What? - And there's more.

708
00:36:54,341 --> 00:36:57,126
They'll get married!

709
00:36:57,471 --> 00:36:58,563
What did you just say?

710
00:36:59,741 --> 00:37:00,881
Are you serious?

711
00:37:00,882 --> 00:37:01,941
Yes, I'm dead serious.

712
00:37:01,942 --> 00:37:04,151
He even proposed to her. I saw him proposing to her earlier!

713
00:37:04,152 --> 00:37:05,233
He proposed...

714
00:37:06,152 --> 00:37:07,351
This is so sudden.

715
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:08,403
I know, right?

716
00:37:09,752 --> 00:37:10,975
What's your big news?

717
00:37:11,122 --> 00:37:12,142
What?

718
00:37:13,591 --> 00:37:15,969
The thing is... I'll just keep it to myself.

719
00:37:16,832 --> 00:37:18,930
It's nothing compared to the news about Ki Bong, so I can't say it.

720
00:37:18,931 --> 00:37:20,768
What is it? Tell me.

721
00:37:22,462 --> 00:37:23,552
The thing is,

722
00:37:25,732 --> 00:37:27,842
I got a lead role in a movie.

723
00:37:28,402 --> 00:37:30,140
A lead role? Seriously?

724
00:37:30,141 --> 00:37:31,295
Yes, seriously.

725
00:37:31,511 --> 00:37:34,776
Well, it's a low-budget independent film though.

726
00:37:34,911 --> 00:37:36,851
Hey, that is amazing!

727
00:37:36,852 --> 00:37:38,107
Congratulations!

728
00:37:40,681 --> 00:37:42,751
Hey, are you going to congratulate me without any gifts?

729
00:37:42,752 --> 00:37:44,384
Buy me a drink!

730
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:45,843
A drink?

731
00:37:46,122 --> 00:37:48,365
I have to head out now for my date.

732
00:37:49,161 --> 00:37:50,181
What?

733
00:37:51,391 --> 00:37:53,800
Hey, your best friend got a lead role in a movie...

734
00:37:53,801 --> 00:37:55,434
for the first time in his life.

735
00:37:55,701 --> 00:37:57,813
You'll go out without even having a drink with me?

736
00:37:57,971 --> 00:38:00,286
What can I do? I made plans with him first.

737
00:38:00,542 --> 00:38:02,000
Let's drink together when I get back, okay?

738
00:38:02,172 --> 00:38:03,222
Hey, wait.

739
00:38:03,942 --> 00:38:05,211
Do you have to go?

740
00:38:05,212 --> 00:38:07,119
You can move your date to another day.

741
00:38:07,341 --> 00:38:08,610
I'll be back soon.

742
00:38:08,611 --> 00:38:10,488
- Let go of my hand. - Hey, come on.

743
00:38:10,652 --> 00:38:12,243
Hang out with me.

744
00:38:12,551 --> 00:38:13,603
Please?

745
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:15,822
Just hang out with me today.

746
00:38:16,451 --> 00:38:18,634
Spend some time with me too.

747
00:38:19,391 --> 00:38:21,768
Min Jun said he'll pick me up.

748
00:38:23,062 --> 00:38:24,663
Forget it! Go! Just go.

749
00:38:24,991 --> 00:38:26,286
You're so mean.

750
00:38:26,562 --> 00:38:28,860
You're no longer my best friend. You got that?

751
00:38:28,861 --> 00:38:30,462
Are you a kid? Why are you all sulky?

752
00:38:30,602 --> 00:38:31,755
See you later, okay?

753
00:38:31,902 --> 00:38:33,197
Hey, wait.

754
00:38:34,102 --> 00:38:36,284
I know I told you to go, but how could you... She's gone.

755
00:38:41,312 --> 00:38:44,110
Fine. She obviously cares more about that jerk than me,

756
00:38:44,111 --> 00:38:45,641
her best friend of 10 years.

757
00:38:47,482 --> 00:38:49,053
That girl is seriously so mean.

758
00:38:51,752 --> 00:38:53,598
What are you doing all alone here?

759
00:38:57,562 --> 00:38:59,938
What's going on? Don't you have a date? Why are you back already?

760
00:39:00,132 --> 00:39:01,324
I canceled it.

761
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,876
What? Why?

762
00:39:08,301 --> 00:39:11,167
Because I knew you'd be sitting here all lonely and sad.

763
00:39:11,272 --> 00:39:12,741
But if I get dumped,

764
00:39:13,011 --> 00:39:15,459
you'll have to take full responsibility for it, okay?

765
00:39:17,051 --> 00:39:18,132
All right.

766
00:39:19,111 --> 00:39:21,295
Sure, why not? I can do that.

767
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:25,609
You're sure, right? You'd better not change your words later on.

768
00:39:30,832 --> 00:39:31,953
Cheers?

769
00:39:32,091 --> 00:39:33,111
Yes, cheers.

770
00:39:44,542 --> 00:39:46,881
What's the occasion? Why are you two drinking together?

771
00:39:46,882 --> 00:39:49,140
Oh, this is a celebratory drink.

772
00:39:49,141 --> 00:39:50,351
A celebratory drink?

773
00:39:50,352 --> 00:39:53,351
Jun Ki landed a lead role in a movie today.

774
00:39:53,352 --> 00:39:54,443
Seriously?

775
00:39:54,622 --> 00:39:55,981
Congratulations, Jun Ki.

776
00:39:55,982 --> 00:39:57,072
Thanks.

777
00:39:57,091 --> 00:39:59,163
Soo Yeon, do you want one too?

778
00:39:59,451 --> 00:40:01,320
No, thanks. I have a lot of work to do.

779
00:40:01,321 --> 00:40:02,485
You two should enjoy your drinks.

780
00:40:02,962 --> 00:40:06,390
Jun Ki, can I get back my portable charger you borrowed from me?

781
00:40:06,391 --> 00:40:07,800
I'll need it tomorrow.

782
00:40:07,801 --> 00:40:09,461
It's on my desk. I'll go bring it now.

783
00:40:09,462 --> 00:40:11,033
No, it's okay. I'll just get it myself.

784
00:40:23,752 --> 00:40:26,230
("Even for Just a Minute")

785
00:40:26,312 --> 00:40:27,679
"Even for Just a Minute"?

786
00:40:31,622 --> 00:40:33,560
Is this the song that Woo Shik wrote?

787
00:40:44,672 --> 00:40:48,242
What are you thinking?

788
00:40:48,872 --> 00:40:50,065
Tell me

789
00:40:51,042 --> 00:40:53,441
Did Woo Shik like Soo Yeon that much?

790
00:40:53,442 --> 00:40:56,041
He's had feelings for her and no one else...

791
00:40:56,042 --> 00:40:57,816
since our high school days.

792
00:40:58,551 --> 00:41:01,846
Shall I practice this song and sing it for you later on?

793
00:41:01,852 --> 00:41:04,442
You're serious, right? You promised!

794
00:41:07,261 --> 00:41:09,561
I ponder all day long

795
00:41:09,562 --> 00:41:12,417
Cheer up. We're here for you.

796
00:41:12,861 --> 00:41:15,789
So whenever you're stressed out or exhausted,

797
00:41:16,431 --> 00:41:17,901
you can lean on our shoulders anytime.

798
00:41:18,431 --> 00:41:19,726
My heart

799
00:41:21,602 --> 00:41:26,467
Is right by your side

800
00:41:27,141 --> 00:41:29,211
I said I'm fine. Why are you being like this?

801
00:41:29,212 --> 00:41:30,410
Who do you think you are?

802
00:41:30,411 --> 00:41:31,550
It's because I like you.

803
00:41:31,551 --> 00:41:34,376
That's why I can't stop caring and worrying about you.

804
00:41:34,982 --> 00:41:37,751
It's only for you

805
00:41:37,752 --> 00:41:41,566
Come into my arms

806
00:41:42,661 --> 00:41:46,231
Even for just a minute

807
00:41:46,232 --> 00:41:49,300
Even for just a second

808
00:41:49,301 --> 00:41:52,901
Would you let me hold you

809
00:41:52,902 --> 00:41:55,340
And feel my love for you?

810
00:41:55,341 --> 00:41:57,962
Of course, we're friends.

811
00:41:58,542 --> 00:42:01,211
Soo Yeon, don't worry about me. I'm really okay.

812
00:42:01,212 --> 00:42:07,648
Then I can tolerate any kind of pain

813
00:42:07,721 --> 00:42:09,981
- You haven't found it? - Open your heart

814
00:42:09,982 --> 00:42:11,921
- It's in this drawer. - To me

815
00:42:11,922 --> 00:42:13,522
Here it is.

816
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:16,908
Hey, what's wrong? Are you crying?

817
00:42:17,891 --> 00:42:20,003
Jun Ki, where is Woo Shik now?

818
00:42:20,261 --> 00:42:22,037
He said he was going to the recording studio.

819
00:42:24,071 --> 00:42:25,123
Hey, your charger...

820
00:43:19,122 --> 00:43:20,652
Hey, what was that about?

821
00:43:20,991 --> 00:43:22,286
Why can't I be the one for you?

822
00:43:23,261 --> 00:43:25,090
What don't you like about me?

823
00:43:25,091 --> 00:43:26,561
I told you it's not about that.

824
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:27,857
Then what is it?

825
00:43:28,332 --> 00:43:29,688
What is the reason?

826
00:43:30,902 --> 00:43:31,952
I...

827
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,921
actually have feelings for someone.

828
00:43:37,372 --> 00:43:38,493
Who?

829
00:43:39,772 --> 00:43:40,801
Is it...

830
00:43:41,611 --> 00:43:42,881
Soo Yeon by any chance?

831
00:43:42,882 --> 00:43:43,972
Yes.

832
00:43:45,082 --> 00:43:46,785
She has been...

833
00:43:47,352 --> 00:43:49,085
and will always be the only one for me.

834
00:43:51,622 --> 00:43:52,713
I'm sorry.

835
00:44:10,002 --> 00:44:11,164
Oh, Soo Yeon!

836
00:44:13,772 --> 00:44:15,067
Hey, Woo Shik.

837
00:44:15,641 --> 00:44:16,907
Where were you at this late hour?

838
00:44:18,382 --> 00:44:20,351
I had to take care of something.

839
00:44:20,352 --> 00:44:21,443
Oh, really?

840
00:44:22,522 --> 00:44:25,142
Why do you look so down? Did something happen?

841
00:44:27,192 --> 00:44:28,517
Nothing.

842
00:44:28,761 --> 00:44:30,088
That's a relief.

843
00:44:30,891 --> 00:44:32,013
Let's go in.

844
00:44:32,391 --> 00:44:33,554
Soo Yeon.

845
00:44:35,962 --> 00:44:37,706
- Dad! - Soo Yeon.

846
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:40,393
Dad.

847
00:44:41,301 --> 00:44:43,178
Where have you been?

848
00:44:43,872 --> 00:44:45,952
Do you know how worried I've been?

849
00:44:46,372 --> 00:44:47,636
I'm sorry, Soo Yeon.

850
00:44:48,942 --> 00:44:51,706
I'm really sorry, Soo Yeon.

851
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:05,709
Thank you for taking good care of Soo Yeon so far.

852
00:45:06,072 --> 00:45:08,663
I can't thank you enough.

853
00:45:08,712 --> 00:45:10,853
Don't mention it. It's been our pleasure.

854
00:45:10,911 --> 00:45:13,768
Still, I'd like to repay you guys for your kindness.

855
00:45:16,221 --> 00:45:19,516
This is a token of my gratitude.

856
00:45:20,022 --> 00:45:21,184
Please take it.

857
00:45:22,121 --> 00:45:24,917
No. Please don't do this.

858
00:45:25,331 --> 00:45:29,238
This will make me feel better.

859
00:45:29,502 --> 00:45:30,655
Please take it.

860
00:45:32,201 --> 00:45:34,211
This is really unnecessary.

861
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:37,085
This is really...

862
00:45:39,342 --> 00:45:40,942
An ice cream cake coupon?

863
00:45:42,241 --> 00:45:46,189
Well, my situation is still not so good.

864
00:45:46,351 --> 00:45:48,361
That's why I couldn't prepare anything more.

865
00:45:48,451 --> 00:45:51,276
Still, that ice cream cake is supposed to be really tasty.

866
00:45:51,851 --> 00:45:53,524
Do exchange it for a cake.

867
00:45:54,192 --> 00:45:56,507
Okay. Thank you.

868
00:45:56,991 --> 00:45:59,511
Soo Yeon, go upstairs and pack up now.

869
00:45:59,891 --> 00:46:01,391
"Pack up"?

870
00:46:01,732 --> 00:46:04,700
I've just managed to get back on my feet...

871
00:46:04,701 --> 00:46:07,629
after being conned.

872
00:46:07,802 --> 00:46:10,973
I'm going to start a small business with a friend in the US.

873
00:46:11,172 --> 00:46:12,271
Really?

874
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:14,140
Come stay with me...

875
00:46:14,141 --> 00:46:16,998
studying something you like.

876
00:46:18,351 --> 00:46:21,350
The flight is tomorrow afternoon. Hurry up and pack up.

877
00:46:21,351 --> 00:46:23,320
- I booked a hotel for you. - Right now?

878
00:46:24,652 --> 00:46:27,518
We can't cause your friends any more trouble.

879
00:46:28,362 --> 00:46:31,625
It's okay. You can stay here if you want.

880
00:46:31,692 --> 00:46:34,048
I really don't want to cause you any more trouble.

881
00:46:34,161 --> 00:46:35,630
Don't worry about that.

882
00:46:35,862 --> 00:46:38,963
If you leave like this, we'll feel bad.

883
00:46:39,002 --> 00:46:40,532
Please stay here.

884
00:46:47,942 --> 00:46:49,472
It's been hard for you, right?

885
00:46:51,152 --> 00:46:54,314
No. Thanks to my friends, it's not been hard at all.

886
00:46:54,922 --> 00:46:56,177
That's good to hear.

887
00:46:57,422 --> 00:46:59,870
By the way, Dad,

888
00:47:00,221 --> 00:47:01,619
do I have to go?

889
00:47:01,822 --> 00:47:03,117
What do you mean by that?

890
00:47:03,891 --> 00:47:07,156
Well, I have a job here.

891
00:47:07,531 --> 00:47:08,889
- A job? - Yes.

892
00:47:09,261 --> 00:47:11,100
I'm working as a reporter.

893
00:47:11,101 --> 00:47:14,541
Soo Yeon, you don't have to work anymore.

894
00:47:14,542 --> 00:47:16,401
I'm doing it because I like it.

895
00:47:16,402 --> 00:47:19,573
If you like that job so much, you could start again in the US.

896
00:47:20,172 --> 00:47:22,731
- Still... - Are you saying...

897
00:47:23,042 --> 00:47:24,540
you want to live away from me again?

898
00:47:24,781 --> 00:47:26,450
No, that's not it.

899
00:47:26,451 --> 00:47:27,644
Then do as I say.

900
00:47:27,781 --> 00:47:31,362
I'm never going to leave you alone again.

901
00:47:35,592 --> 00:47:38,212
- Is Soo Yeon really leaving? - I know.

902
00:47:38,661 --> 00:47:40,599
I didn't know she'd leave so suddenly.

903
00:47:41,902 --> 00:47:44,727
Right. What are you going to do with Min Ah?

904
00:47:44,732 --> 00:47:46,201
Are you going to go out with her?

905
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:48,541
No. I already turned her down.

906
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:50,755
What? Why?

907
00:47:52,572 --> 00:47:53,969
Tell us the truth.

908
00:47:54,681 --> 00:47:56,141
Do you still have feelings for Soo Yeon?

909
00:47:59,281 --> 00:48:00,474
You do.

910
00:48:00,822 --> 00:48:01,974
What are you going to do now?

911
00:48:02,152 --> 00:48:03,477
Are you going to just let her go?

912
00:48:03,781 --> 00:48:05,047
I have no choice.

913
00:48:06,121 --> 00:48:07,720
She's been struggling here.

914
00:48:07,721 --> 00:48:09,802
But in the US, she can study what she likes...

915
00:48:10,322 --> 00:48:11,995
and stay with her dad.

916
00:48:13,061 --> 00:48:14,631
It'd be much better for her.

917
00:48:14,632 --> 00:48:17,150
- Still, you can't just... - It's okay.

918
00:48:17,161 --> 00:48:18,529
It doesn't matter to me.

919
00:48:20,902 --> 00:48:22,432
As long as she can be happy.

920
00:48:23,272 --> 00:48:25,822
So don't say anything to her.

921
00:48:26,011 --> 00:48:28,021
Say a word to her,

922
00:48:28,612 --> 00:48:31,406
and I'll be really angry with you guys. Got it?

923
00:48:50,772 --> 00:48:52,403
Soo Yeon, what are you doing here?

924
00:48:52,772 --> 00:48:55,495
Well, I couldn't fall asleep.

925
00:48:56,542 --> 00:48:58,275
Why are you still up?

926
00:48:58,842 --> 00:49:00,442
I couldn't fall asleep either.

927
00:49:02,741 --> 00:49:05,230
- Is your dad asleep? - Yes.

928
00:49:08,652 --> 00:49:11,885
This is the last night you'll spend here.

929
00:49:13,491 --> 00:49:15,296
It feels like yesterday that we met again.

930
00:49:16,092 --> 00:49:17,622
Time flies.

931
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:19,953
Right?

932
00:49:21,601 --> 00:49:22,682
Right.

933
00:49:26,701 --> 00:49:28,885
Thank you for everything, Woo Shik.

934
00:49:30,471 --> 00:49:31,940
Don't mention it.

935
00:49:33,672 --> 00:49:35,477
I haven't done anything for you.

936
00:49:35,712 --> 00:49:36,833
That's not true.

937
00:49:37,911 --> 00:49:41,594
I'm grateful for everything you've ever done for me.

938
00:49:44,522 --> 00:49:45,715
Don't say that.

939
00:49:47,121 --> 00:49:48,621
We're friends.

940
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:55,325
Yes.

941
00:49:57,502 --> 00:49:59,440
We're friends.

942
00:50:08,382 --> 00:50:10,249
Soo Yeon, you have to leave early tomorrow.

943
00:50:10,482 --> 00:50:11,838
Why don't you go to bed now?

944
00:50:11,951 --> 00:50:14,981
You go to bed first. I'll stay here for a bit longer.

945
00:50:16,181 --> 00:50:17,303
All right.

946
00:50:20,052 --> 00:50:21,285
Wait, Woo Shik.

947
00:50:22,522 --> 00:50:24,123
What is it?

948
00:50:30,531 --> 00:50:32,439
Nothing. Never mind.

949
00:50:37,172 --> 00:50:38,395
Goodnight.

950
00:50:41,212 --> 00:50:43,425
Goodnight. Don't stay up too late.

951
00:51:31,592 --> 00:51:34,356
Thank you guys for everything.

952
00:51:35,261 --> 00:51:36,659
I'll never forget your kindness.

953
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:40,494
It's not like we'll never see each other again in this high-tech age.

954
00:51:40,572 --> 00:51:44,140
She's right. Let's not get all dramatic and cry or something.

955
00:51:44,141 --> 00:51:46,723
It's not for us. I'm not letting anyone cry.

956
00:51:47,712 --> 00:51:48,833
Fine.

957
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:52,787
It's time to say goodbye to Rebecca too.

958
00:51:54,112 --> 00:51:55,275
What would have happened...

959
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:58,321
if I hadn't hidden in Rebecca's trunk...

960
00:51:58,322 --> 00:52:01,015
while running away from the wedding hall that day?

961
00:52:01,061 --> 00:52:04,530
What else? You wouldn't have met us and would have skipped all the mess.

962
00:52:05,261 --> 00:52:06,384
No.

963
00:52:07,132 --> 00:52:09,375
I was lucky to end up in Rebecca's trunk.

964
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:13,153
It's the best thing that has ever happened in my life.

965
00:52:14,232 --> 00:52:17,782
Guys, goodbyes should be short and memorable.

966
00:52:18,011 --> 00:52:20,520
Your dad is waiting. You should go now, Soo Yeon.

967
00:52:20,672 --> 00:52:22,211
Okay. I'll get going then.

968
00:52:24,911 --> 00:52:27,359
Woo Shik, I'm leaving.

969
00:52:28,022 --> 00:52:29,787
When your album is released, please send a copy to me.

970
00:52:30,652 --> 00:52:33,069
Okay. I will.

971
00:52:34,221 --> 00:52:35,344
Bye.

972
00:52:39,692 --> 00:52:42,149
I'm really leaving now.

973
00:53:31,011 --> 00:53:33,734
Doesn't this place feel so empty without Soo Yeon?

974
00:53:33,882 --> 00:53:36,580
How could it feel so desolate with just one person gone?

975
00:53:36,581 --> 00:53:38,921
I wonder if Soo Yeon arrived at the airport by now.

976
00:53:38,922 --> 00:53:40,051
She probably did.

977
00:53:40,052 --> 00:53:41,827
There's less than an hour left till her flight.

978
00:53:42,462 --> 00:53:43,615
Woo Shik.

979
00:53:44,192 --> 00:53:45,591
Are you really okay?

980
00:53:45,592 --> 00:53:46,682
What?

981
00:53:47,661 --> 00:53:49,364
Of course I am.

982
00:53:50,831 --> 00:53:53,321
I'm really okay. Don't worry.

983
00:53:55,342 --> 00:53:57,671
- Mr. Cha. - Min Ah, what brings you here?

984
00:53:57,672 --> 00:54:00,410
I was dumped, but you didn't even buy me a drink.

985
00:54:00,411 --> 00:54:02,451
I came to ask you to buy me a drink.

986
00:54:02,741 --> 00:54:03,802
What?

987
00:54:05,712 --> 00:54:07,618
Why do you all look so down?

988
00:54:07,851 --> 00:54:10,371
Well, Soo Yeon left.

989
00:54:10,422 --> 00:54:12,329
She left? Where?

990
00:54:12,692 --> 00:54:14,591
She left for the US with her dad.

991
00:54:14,592 --> 00:54:15,682
What?

992
00:54:16,862 --> 00:54:19,390
And you just let her go like that?

993
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:21,808
You said you still like Soo Yeon.

994
00:54:22,831 --> 00:54:25,555
That's just a crush though.

995
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:28,671
Wait. Don't tell me that...

996
00:54:28,672 --> 00:54:30,071
you still didn't know.

997
00:54:30,072 --> 00:54:31,071
Didn't know what?

998
00:54:31,072 --> 00:54:33,692
You didn't know Soo Yeon liked you?

999
00:54:33,772 --> 00:54:36,331
What? Soo Yeon likes me? What do you mean?

1000
00:54:37,042 --> 00:54:38,948
You're so slow-witted.

1001
00:54:39,052 --> 00:54:40,280
How could you not know?

1002
00:54:40,281 --> 00:54:42,881
How could you know something that I don't even know?

1003
00:54:42,882 --> 00:54:44,080
How could I not know?

1004
00:54:44,081 --> 00:54:45,990
When you were at the emergency room,

1005
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,063
couldn't you tell when she came running to see you?

1006
00:54:48,221 --> 00:54:50,058
She looked more startled than me.

1007
00:54:50,422 --> 00:54:52,063
It was so obvious to me.

1008
00:54:52,362 --> 00:54:55,861
She was just surprised because I had fainted.

1009
00:54:55,862 --> 00:54:57,085
Hold on.

1010
00:54:58,902 --> 00:55:01,301
That's why Soo Yeon was crying.

1011
00:55:01,302 --> 00:55:02,571
Crying? What are you talking about?

1012
00:55:02,572 --> 00:55:05,836
I mean, she was listening to your song and crying yesterday.

1013
00:55:05,971 --> 00:55:08,430
She said she had something to tell you, and rushed out.

1014
00:55:08,882 --> 00:55:10,717
So that was why.

1015
00:55:10,982 --> 00:55:12,032
What?

1016
00:55:12,311 --> 00:55:14,080
How could you tell me that now?

1017
00:55:14,081 --> 00:55:16,938
I just thought Soo Yeon wanted to compliment you on your song.

1018
00:55:18,322 --> 00:55:20,392
But why did she leave without saying she likes you?

1019
00:55:21,022 --> 00:55:23,714
- That's strange. - There's no time for that.

1020
00:55:24,022 --> 00:55:25,260
Call Soo Yeon right now.

1021
00:55:25,261 --> 00:55:26,761
Okay, I will.

1022
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:32,537
The phone is turned off...

1023
00:55:33,232 --> 00:55:34,803
Her phone is turned off. What should I do?

1024
00:55:35,402 --> 00:55:37,771
You still have some time until the plane takes off.

1025
00:55:37,772 --> 00:55:38,910
Go to the airport now.

1026
00:55:38,911 --> 00:55:40,510
Okay. I'll go now.

1027
00:55:40,511 --> 00:55:41,634
Wait.

1028
00:55:42,042 --> 00:55:43,062
Take this.

1029
00:55:44,442 --> 00:55:46,651
What is this? You want me to take Rebecca?

1030
00:55:46,652 --> 00:55:47,907
Of course.

1031
00:55:48,121 --> 00:55:49,917
You should trust Rebecca.

1032
00:55:50,451 --> 00:55:51,543
Get going then.

1033
00:55:52,322 --> 00:55:53,821
Go and stop her.

1034
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,229
Okay. I'll see you later.

1035
00:55:59,295 --> 00:56:01,917
What on earth? 20km an hour?

1036
00:56:02,135 --> 00:56:03,421
What kind of car is this?

1037
00:56:03,635 --> 00:56:05,879
Rebecca, please help me out this once.

1038
00:56:06,266 --> 00:56:09,468
And can you please turn off this song?

1039
00:56:11,505 --> 00:56:12,627
What's wrong?

1040
00:56:17,045 --> 00:56:18,065
What is this?

1041
00:56:18,815 --> 00:56:19,835
No.

1042
00:56:20,846 --> 00:56:21,875
No!

1043
00:56:22,485 --> 00:56:24,455
No, Rebecca!

1044
00:56:28,525 --> 00:56:29,577
No...

1045
00:56:31,425 --> 00:56:33,465
No, Rebecca!

1046
00:56:34,025 --> 00:56:36,076
No...

1047
00:56:37,496 --> 00:56:40,770
No!

1048
00:56:51,215 --> 00:56:52,337
Darn it.

1049
00:56:53,215 --> 00:56:54,612
How could this happen?

1050
00:56:55,485 --> 00:56:57,933
Everyone makes it safely to the airport in movies or dramas.

1051
00:56:58,626 --> 00:57:00,493
I couldn't even go near the airport.

1052
00:57:00,855 --> 00:57:02,732
How on earth could this happen?

1053
00:57:03,326 --> 00:57:06,079
No, I'm the madman for taking Rebecca.

1054
00:57:11,806 --> 00:57:14,457
(Hotteok)

1055
00:57:17,306 --> 00:57:19,044
Hotteok? I love hotteok.

1056
00:57:19,045 --> 00:57:20,044
Let's go, Woo Shik.

1057
00:57:20,045 --> 00:57:21,575
Ma'am, we'll have two pieces of hotteok.

1058
00:57:21,576 --> 00:57:23,657
Woo Shik, let's get 3. I want 2 pieces.

1059
00:57:24,815 --> 00:57:27,538
Your girlfriend must love hotteok.

1060
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,992
Can you buy me two pieces?

1061
00:57:32,485 --> 00:57:35,820
I think I'll feel better if I eat one more hotteok.

1062
00:57:40,866 --> 00:57:44,334
(Hotteok)

1063
00:57:45,536 --> 00:57:46,861
- Hello, ma'am. - Hi.

1064
00:57:46,936 --> 00:57:48,104
Give me one hotteok.

1065
00:57:48,105 --> 00:57:49,258
Just a second.

1066
00:57:52,476 --> 00:57:53,699
- Here you go. - Okay.

1067
00:57:54,206 --> 00:57:55,440
Thank you.

1068
00:58:25,306 --> 00:58:26,804
I'll have one hotteok too.

1069
00:58:26,905 --> 00:58:27,925
Okay.

1070
00:58:32,315 --> 00:58:33,367
Soo Yeon.

1071
00:58:33,916 --> 00:58:35,140
What happened?

1072
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:38,586
It somehow just happened.

1073
00:58:39,726 --> 00:58:40,754
Here you go.

1074
00:58:40,755 --> 00:58:42,021
- Thank you. - Sure.

1075
00:58:43,726 --> 00:58:45,807
Why are you standing here eating hotteok?

1076
00:58:46,226 --> 00:58:48,205
Why did you leave your phone at home?

1077
00:58:48,996 --> 00:58:51,365
Do you know how long I waited at the airport because of you?

1078
00:58:51,366 --> 00:58:53,680
It's because Rebecca suddenly broke down...

1079
00:58:56,976 --> 00:58:58,883
You waited for me?

1080
00:59:00,275 --> 00:59:01,295
Why?

1081
00:59:01,346 --> 00:59:03,182
I heard you still like me.

1082
00:59:04,045 --> 00:59:05,065
What?

1083
00:59:05,315 --> 00:59:07,050
How do you know that?

1084
00:59:08,556 --> 00:59:09,637
Well...

1085
00:59:10,186 --> 00:59:12,785
I left something behind, so I called the guesthouse...

1086
00:59:12,786 --> 00:59:14,896
before I got on the plane, and your friends told me.

1087
00:59:16,496 --> 00:59:17,577
Then...

1088
00:59:18,925 --> 00:59:20,424
Did you come back because of me?

1089
00:59:20,425 --> 00:59:21,486
No.

1090
00:59:22,295 --> 00:59:23,723
Come to think of it,

1091
00:59:24,135 --> 00:59:26,234
I even have a new program under my name,

1092
00:59:26,235 --> 00:59:28,000
and just leaving like this is such a waste.

1093
00:59:28,275 --> 00:59:30,142
I felt so irresponsible too.

1094
00:59:31,945 --> 00:59:35,005
And if I go to the US, I can't eat this yummy hotteok.

1095
00:59:36,576 --> 00:59:37,738
I see.

1096
00:59:38,786 --> 00:59:40,346
And more importantly,

1097
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,224
the person I like is here.

1098
00:59:45,985 --> 00:59:47,107
The person you like?

1099
00:59:47,155 --> 00:59:48,247
Yes.

1100
00:59:49,096 --> 00:59:50,147
I...

1101
00:59:57,166 --> 00:59:59,552
really like my friends at the guest house.

1102
01:00:04,706 --> 01:00:05,869
Really?

1103
01:00:08,576 --> 01:00:12,187
But there's actually one person that I like especially.

1104
01:00:15,215 --> 01:00:16,337
Who is it?

1105
01:00:19,226 --> 01:00:20,378
I don't know.

1106
01:00:21,596 --> 01:00:22,717
Who do you think it is?

1107
01:00:27,465 --> 01:00:29,678
Woo Shik, can you hold this for me?

1108
01:00:29,866 --> 01:00:30,917
Okay.

1109
01:01:24,956 --> 01:01:28,526
(3 years later)

1110
01:01:29,046 --> 01:01:30,126
What do you think?

1111
01:01:30,305 --> 01:01:31,445
It's neat inside,

1112
01:01:31,446 --> 01:01:33,615
and isn't the interior so nice too?

1113
01:01:33,616 --> 01:01:35,684
On top of that, this is such a great location,

1114
01:01:35,685 --> 01:01:38,045
and everyone who lived here became successful with their work.

1115
01:01:38,046 --> 01:01:39,554
Oh, really?

1116
01:01:39,555 --> 01:01:41,391
Of course. Look over there.

1117
01:01:42,225 --> 01:01:44,939
A famous singer named Shiva Woo Shik,

1118
01:01:44,995 --> 01:01:46,689
an actor who received an award at a movie award,

1119
01:01:47,026 --> 01:01:48,627
a top home run hitter in baseball,

1120
01:01:48,696 --> 01:01:50,603
an extremely popular reporter,

1121
01:01:50,866 --> 01:01:53,394
a CEO of a famous franchise restaurant,

1122
01:01:53,395 --> 01:01:56,834
and on top of that, an actress and model who is...

1123
01:01:56,835 --> 01:01:58,916
loved by the nation as a famous scene stealer.

1124
01:01:58,935 --> 01:02:01,047
No one left this place without becoming famous.

1125
01:02:01,276 --> 01:02:03,974
Really? But I've never seen any of these people.

1126
01:02:03,975 --> 01:02:06,290
They're all busy working abroad lately.

1127
01:02:06,716 --> 01:02:09,336
They're really well-know abroad. You didn't know?

1128
01:02:09,915 --> 01:02:12,332
What do you think? Shall we sign the contract?

1129
01:02:13,185 --> 01:02:14,255
I'm not sure.

1130
01:02:14,256 --> 01:02:15,454
Let me think about it a little more.

1131
01:02:15,455 --> 01:02:17,628
Come on, there's nothing to think about.

1132
01:02:18,055 --> 01:02:19,381
If you sign right now,

1133
01:02:20,096 --> 01:02:22,795
I'll give you that long smoking pipe as a gift.

1134
01:02:22,796 --> 01:02:24,836
What? I don't need it.

1135
01:02:25,165 --> 01:02:27,032
I'll think about it for a few days and call you.

1136
01:02:27,096 --> 01:02:28,288
I'll be off, then.

1137
01:02:28,835 --> 01:02:30,640
That's the longest pipe you'll ever see!

1138
01:02:30,966 --> 01:02:32,405
Do you know how long it is?

1139
01:02:32,406 --> 01:02:34,414
It's the longest pipe in the whole world!

1140
01:02:42,185 --> 01:02:43,307
Be careful.

1141
01:02:52,696 --> 01:02:53,818
How did it go?

1142
01:02:53,855 --> 01:02:55,762
He, too, said he'll think about it for a few days.

1143
01:02:55,966 --> 01:02:57,994
Is he Auguste Rodin or what?

1144
01:02:57,995 --> 01:03:00,107
I told you that this wouldn't work.

1145
01:03:00,165 --> 01:03:02,565
What idiot would buy such blatant lies?

1146
01:03:02,566 --> 01:03:03,728
Are you all idiots?

1147
01:03:04,335 --> 01:03:07,474
Goodness, your album only sold 20 copies.

1148
01:03:07,475 --> 01:03:10,104
What? "A famous singer"? Gosh.

1149
01:03:10,105 --> 01:03:12,186
It's still more than the number of people who watched your movie.

1150
01:03:12,515 --> 01:03:14,893
- Only 17 people watched your movie. - What?

1151
01:03:15,046 --> 01:03:17,414
Not really, five of them were us.

1152
01:03:17,415 --> 01:03:18,608
And two were Jun Ki's parents.

1153
01:03:18,685 --> 01:03:20,247
So the accurate count is 10.

1154
01:03:21,116 --> 01:03:24,348
It still outnumbers the members of your baseball academy by seven.

1155
01:03:24,585 --> 01:03:26,799
You only have three members.

1156
01:03:26,826 --> 01:03:29,624
No. 1 canceled the membership yesterday, so there are 2 now.

1157
01:03:29,625 --> 01:03:30,965
Oh, is that right?

1158
01:03:30,966 --> 01:03:32,034
Go ahead and brag about it.

1159
01:03:32,035 --> 01:03:34,280
Exactly. You're in no position to laugh at us!

1160
01:03:36,665 --> 01:03:38,470
Honey, it's okay.

1161
01:03:38,736 --> 01:03:41,633
The number has doubled compared to last month.

1162
01:03:42,205 --> 01:03:44,083
You little brats.

1163
01:03:44,105 --> 01:03:46,374
How dare you belittle Se Chang's dad right in front of him?

1164
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:47,702
Shall I teach you guys a lesson?

1165
01:03:48,015 --> 01:03:49,914
Yu Ri, why are you getting all mad at Woo Shik?

1166
01:03:49,915 --> 01:03:52,537
Ki Bong made fun of Jun Ki earlier too.

1167
01:03:52,656 --> 01:03:53,981
You're too biased.

1168
01:03:54,816 --> 01:03:57,184
Do you girls want a showdown as couples?

1169
01:03:57,185 --> 01:03:59,908
Be quiet! This is driving me crazy.

1170
01:04:00,326 --> 01:04:02,164
What kind of sin did I commit in my past life?

1171
01:04:02,165 --> 01:04:05,705
Why do I always end up with tenants like you guys?

1172
01:04:05,736 --> 01:04:09,336
Well, Ms. Kim. Maybe you committed a mortal sin in your past life.

1173
01:04:09,566 --> 01:04:12,330
- Like betraying your country. - Good point.

1174
01:04:12,975 --> 01:04:15,597
And that being said, would you be able to reduce our rent...

1175
01:04:15,645 --> 01:04:17,105
as a way of repenting your sin?

1176
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:18,972
It'd be even better if there was no rent.

1177
01:04:19,515 --> 01:04:20,740
That will be great. Nice.

1178
01:04:21,116 --> 01:04:23,533
You little rats, seriously.

1179
01:04:24,116 --> 01:04:27,522
All of you are done for.

1180
01:04:28,585 --> 01:04:29,707
You punk!

1181
01:04:30,256 --> 01:04:31,887
- Gosh, Ms. Kim! No! - You too!

1182
01:04:32,696 --> 01:04:33,849
Ms. Kim!

1183
01:05:00,555 --> 01:05:04,870
(Thank you for watching Welcome to Waikiki 2 / Eulachacha Waikiki 2.)
