1
00:00:12,457 --> 00:00:13,460
Han Soo Yeon.

2
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:15,338
What are you doing here?

3
00:00:15,387 --> 00:00:17,065
Who are you guys?

4
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:19,029
How do you know my name?

5
00:00:19,388 --> 00:00:21,346
Hey, don't you remember us?

6
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:23,376
Class 2-3 of Huam High School.

7
00:00:24,298 --> 00:00:25,672
We were in the same class.

8
00:00:26,557 --> 00:00:28,447
It's me, Ki Bong.

9
00:00:28,527 --> 00:00:29,666
The ace of the baseball club.

10
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:31,789
I won the best player award at Bonghwang Baseball Awards.

11
00:00:34,637 --> 00:00:36,627
She can't even remember you, idiot.

12
00:00:37,268 --> 00:00:38,937
What about me then?

13
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:40,176
It's me, Lee Jun Ki.

14
00:00:40,177 --> 00:00:41,592
The handsome guy from the drama club.

15
00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:43,888
This is so frustrating.

16
00:00:43,948 --> 00:00:45,029
Wait a second.

17
00:00:45,877 --> 00:00:47,617
Are you Jun Ki who always acted arrogant,

18
00:00:47,618 --> 00:00:49,816
saying that you'd be an actor?

19
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:51,287
Right, that arrogant jerk.

20
00:00:51,288 --> 00:00:53,017
And you're Kook Ki Bong, right?

21
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:54,674
- Yes. - Right, Kook Ki Bong.

22
00:00:55,057 --> 00:00:56,400
Now you remember us.

23
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:59,541
What about him?

24
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:01,081
Don't you remember him?

25
00:01:03,298 --> 00:01:05,737
He was a band member, and always carried around a guitar.

26
00:01:05,738 --> 00:01:07,526
The lead singer of Volcano.

27
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:09,867
- Cha Woo Shik? - Right!

28
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:11,353
Now you remember all of us.

29
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,007
Right, do you remember the masked singer...

30
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:15,593
who sang at your wedding?

31
00:01:15,957 --> 00:01:17,483
It was him.

32
00:01:17,498 --> 00:01:18,638
I enjoyed your song.

33
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:20,766
That was really you?

34
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:21,777
What?

35
00:01:23,137 --> 00:01:24,147
Well...

36
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:28,063
But what about you?

37
00:01:28,507 --> 00:01:29,589
Why are you here?

38
00:01:29,607 --> 00:01:30,647
What?

39
00:01:33,007 --> 00:01:34,058
It's because...

40
00:01:34,947 --> 00:01:36,634
I don't know either.

41
00:01:44,387 --> 00:01:46,074
I don't know why I'm here.

42
00:01:48,527 --> 00:01:50,556
(Butterfly Effect)

43
00:01:50,557 --> 00:01:52,797
(A phenomenon where a small difference leads to a big change.)

44
00:01:52,798 --> 00:01:54,586
So to summarize,

45
00:01:54,997 --> 00:01:57,506
Soo Yeon was being chased by creditors...

46
00:01:57,507 --> 00:01:59,558
and she got into Rebecca by pure coincidence.

47
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:01,420
Isn't it such a surprising coincidence...

48
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,305
No, this isn't a coincidence. Isn't it fate?

49
00:02:04,378 --> 00:02:06,006
Be quiet. Fate, my foot.

50
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:08,744
Why? We've been reunited with our first love after all this time.

51
00:02:09,877 --> 00:02:12,139
Why? Your fiance isn't answering either?

52
00:02:12,388 --> 00:02:13,398
No.

53
00:02:14,687 --> 00:02:16,001
Thanks for letting me use your phone, Ki Bong.

54
00:02:16,018 --> 00:02:18,686
I'll get going then. I'm so worried about my dad.

55
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:19,887
Wait.

56
00:02:19,888 --> 00:02:22,556
You can't even reach him and don't know where he is.

57
00:02:22,557 --> 00:02:24,026
I should try looking for him at home.

58
00:02:24,027 --> 00:02:26,026
The creditors will be crawling all over the house by now.

59
00:02:26,027 --> 00:02:27,227
I doubt he'll be there.

60
00:02:27,228 --> 00:02:28,248
That makes sense.

61
00:02:28,638 --> 00:02:29,980
Then what should I do?

62
00:02:29,997 --> 00:02:33,067
Then why don't you spend the night here...

63
00:02:33,668 --> 00:02:35,536
What are you talking about? Spend the night here?

64
00:02:35,537 --> 00:02:36,607
Do you have a better plan?

65
00:02:36,608 --> 00:02:38,224
- Still, it's ridiculous. - Quiet!.

66
00:02:40,108 --> 00:02:41,663
The second floor is nice and cozy.

67
00:02:41,678 --> 00:02:43,376
- Let's go. - No, it's fine.

68
00:02:43,377 --> 00:02:44,887
Don't worry about it.

69
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:46,129
I'm home.

70
00:02:46,148 --> 00:02:47,197
Hey.

71
00:02:47,587 --> 00:02:49,102
- Who is she? - Oh, it's Soo Yeon...

72
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:50,887
Whatever, it's a long story.

73
00:02:50,888 --> 00:02:52,504
Forget it. Let's go upstairs, Soo Yeon.

74
00:02:52,557 --> 00:02:54,927
- Go get some rest. - It's okay. Don't worry about it.

75
00:02:54,928 --> 00:02:55,968
Soo Yeon?

76
00:02:57,027 --> 00:02:58,816
I think I've heard that name from somewhere.

77
00:02:59,398 --> 00:03:01,053
Where have I heard it?

78
00:03:04,337 --> 00:03:05,418
Hold on.

79
00:03:05,738 --> 00:03:07,336
Isn't she the girl from the yearbook...

80
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:08,994
that all three of you liked?

81
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:10,919
What is she doing here?

82
00:03:11,148 --> 00:03:13,399
And what is that wedding dress? Tell me.

83
00:03:14,448 --> 00:03:16,943
Hey, tell me what's happening.

84
00:03:22,488 --> 00:03:23,932
What are you guys doing so early in the morning?

85
00:03:24,627 --> 00:03:26,142
- Getting ready for a fashion show? - Hey.

86
00:03:26,428 --> 00:03:28,297
We've met our first love in 10 years.

87
00:03:28,298 --> 00:03:30,419
We have to leave a good impression.

88
00:03:31,728 --> 00:03:32,809
Hey, look.

89
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:34,496
You can't see any nose hair now, can you?

90
00:03:34,497 --> 00:03:35,750
No, I don't see any.

91
00:03:36,198 --> 00:03:38,107
Hey, how do I look?

92
00:03:38,108 --> 00:03:39,854
You look okay, but...

93
00:03:40,168 --> 00:03:42,177
something is missing...

94
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:43,551
- What is it? - Let's see.

95
00:03:48,418 --> 00:03:52,017
There you go. Your face looks totally dashing now.

96
00:03:52,018 --> 00:03:53,199
You're right.

97
00:03:53,717 --> 00:03:54,828
I do look dashing.

98
00:03:55,217 --> 00:03:57,827
Hey, don't you think Soo Yeon looks pretty as ever?

99
00:03:57,828 --> 00:03:59,257
She got even prettier.

100
00:03:59,258 --> 00:04:00,268
Tell me about it.

101
00:04:01,627 --> 00:04:02,870
Get a grip!

102
00:04:03,097 --> 00:04:05,066
We're about to be kicked out because of our overdue rent.

103
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:06,511
- Is this the time for this? - Hey.

104
00:04:07,228 --> 00:04:09,936
Don't say that in front of Soo Yeon. Okay?

105
00:04:09,937 --> 00:04:13,007
Why not? You don't want to look like a loser in front of her?

106
00:04:13,008 --> 00:04:14,755
That's a given.

107
00:04:15,238 --> 00:04:17,904
That's how all men feel about their first love.

108
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:21,176
We always want to impress them,

109
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,517
and we want them to only have good memories of us.

110
00:04:23,518 --> 00:04:25,467
That's what first love means to men, okay?

111
00:04:25,518 --> 00:04:28,817
So you have to tell her that I'm doing very well as an actor.

112
00:04:28,818 --> 00:04:30,986
- Got it? - I'm a successful baseball player.

113
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:33,127
I'm temporarily in the minor league due to my injury, okay?

114
00:04:33,128 --> 00:04:34,269
Sounds good. Great idea.

115
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,245
How could you be like this, knowing our situation?

116
00:04:36,698 --> 00:04:39,026
You two are just bluffing,

117
00:04:39,027 --> 00:04:41,137
which is the most obnoxious thing anyone can do. Do you realize that?

118
00:04:41,138 --> 00:04:42,836
- Yes, I do! - What? You do?

119
00:04:42,837 --> 00:04:45,666
Who cares? I just want to leave a good impression on her.

120
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:47,587
Can we afford to talk about our first love right now?

121
00:04:47,677 --> 00:04:49,223
What are we going to do about our rent?

122
00:04:49,407 --> 00:04:51,468
I'm sick of acting like I'm dating our landlady.

123
00:04:51,977 --> 00:04:53,694
It's really killing me.

124
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:57,216
She wants to go to the amusement park again.

125
00:04:57,217 --> 00:04:59,216
Hang in there, okay?

126
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:01,278
We'll try to get the money somehow.

127
00:05:01,717 --> 00:05:03,986
Hey. Before that, Soo Yeon is probably hungry now.

128
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:05,907
- Shouldn't we give her some food? - Shall we?

129
00:05:06,727 --> 00:05:07,839
Let's go wake her up.

130
00:05:07,998 --> 00:05:10,684
Just come join us for breakfast, mister.

131
00:05:13,128 --> 00:05:14,238
Let's go.

132
00:05:15,268 --> 00:05:17,055
I'll wake her up.

133
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:18,749
Hey, this looks good, right?

134
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:21,431
Jung Eun, where are you going so early?

135
00:05:22,078 --> 00:05:23,754
I got a new part-time job.

136
00:05:24,847 --> 00:05:26,776
By the way, what's with those sunglasses?

137
00:05:26,777 --> 00:05:27,928
I got it on an 80-month pay plan.

138
00:05:29,717 --> 00:05:30,788
My goodness!

139
00:05:32,188 --> 00:05:33,647
What happened? Why is she sleeping here?

140
00:05:33,648 --> 00:05:34,798
It's Soo Yeon.

141
00:05:36,157 --> 00:05:38,653
- Soo Yeon, wake up. Soo Yeon. - Yes.

142
00:05:41,527 --> 00:05:42,972
Why did you sleep here?

143
00:05:44,128 --> 00:05:45,279
Good morning.

144
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:48,568
I guess I fell asleep while calling my dad.

145
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:50,051
Oh, I see.

146
00:05:50,297 --> 00:05:52,793
- He's still not answering? - No.

147
00:05:54,907 --> 00:05:56,726
By the way, is this phone broken?

148
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,229
- It keeps getting disconnected. - What? That can't be.

149
00:05:59,308 --> 00:06:01,843
Our Gulliver? The connection gets lost sometimes.

150
00:06:02,518 --> 00:06:05,244
I'll show you. There's a reason why the cord is so long.

151
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:08,280
First, step on it like this and bite it.

152
00:06:08,587 --> 00:06:10,709
Ta-da! I'm Gulliver the Phone!

153
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,004
- Gulliver. - Now, it should work.

154
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,710
Really?

155
00:06:16,128 --> 00:06:18,017
By the way, why didn't you get changed?

156
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:19,440
You don't want to wear guys' clothes?

157
00:06:19,527 --> 00:06:21,417
Then do you want to borrow her clothes instead?

158
00:06:23,398 --> 00:06:25,226
- No, it's okay. - I hear you.

159
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:26,949
You're wise.

160
00:06:27,837 --> 00:06:30,535
What was that about? She just looked down on me, didn't she?

161
00:06:30,777 --> 00:06:32,747
Well, do I look that unstylish?

162
00:06:32,748 --> 00:06:34,577
- What time is it now? - What's wrong with me?

163
00:06:34,578 --> 00:06:35,647
- I'm so cold. - What time is it?

164
00:06:35,648 --> 00:06:38,071
Whatever, forget it. Look at yourselves.

165
00:06:39,987 --> 00:06:41,757
Gosh, she's sulking again.

166
00:06:41,758 --> 00:06:42,868
Soo Yeon.

167
00:06:43,787 --> 00:06:44,899
Goodness.

168
00:06:45,287 --> 00:06:46,773
Soo Yeon!

169
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:52,912
You'll get a hold of him soon.

170
00:06:53,198 --> 00:06:56,097
- Don't worry too much. - Yes, okay.

171
00:06:58,268 --> 00:06:59,923
By the way, what happened there?

172
00:07:00,438 --> 00:07:02,497
Oh, that. We told you about it yesterday. A meteorite fell.

173
00:07:06,248 --> 00:07:08,237
Oh, we put that up there to cover the hole.

174
00:07:13,948 --> 00:07:15,735
I have to say, it's been such a long time.

175
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:17,503
How have you guys been?

176
00:07:19,258 --> 00:07:20,368
What?

177
00:07:24,198 --> 00:07:25,511
I'm actually an actor now.

178
00:07:26,398 --> 00:07:27,466
Actor.

179
00:07:27,467 --> 00:07:30,628
I'm busy shooting movies and TV dramas these days.

180
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:32,836
I'm working on a project with Hun.

181
00:07:32,837 --> 00:07:34,222
Hun. You know Hun, right?

182
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,657
- Hun? - "Why did you do that to me?"

183
00:07:36,777 --> 00:07:38,797
Hun. Lee Byung Hun.

184
00:07:39,547 --> 00:07:41,739
- My gosh, that's amazing. - It's no big deal.

185
00:07:42,047 --> 00:07:43,765
- What about you, Ki Bong? - Me?

186
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:48,642
I'm a pitcher, a professional pitcher.

187
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:51,387
I play in the minor league now due to my injury,

188
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,997
but those in the major league are desperately waiting for me.

189
00:07:54,998 --> 00:07:57,026
Guys, you said you're busy today.

190
00:07:57,027 --> 00:07:58,210
- Don't you have to get going? - What?

191
00:07:58,797 --> 00:07:59,938
- We should head out. - Yes.

192
00:08:00,027 --> 00:08:01,178
Soo Yeon.

193
00:08:02,337 --> 00:08:04,115
- I have a training session. - I have a shoot.

194
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:05,681
Call us if you need anything.

195
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,924
- Oh, my. - This has been bothering me.

196
00:08:11,547 --> 00:08:13,676
- Come give me a hand. - All right.

197
00:08:13,677 --> 00:08:15,232
1, 2, 3.

198
00:08:20,087 --> 00:08:21,532
It doesn't look good, you know.

199
00:08:22,987 --> 00:08:24,574
- See you later. - See you later.

200
00:08:24,857 --> 00:08:26,856
All right. Have a good day.

201
00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:28,544
- Bye. - Bye, guys.

202
00:08:30,328 --> 00:08:31,641
They've both made a name for themselves.

203
00:08:33,128 --> 00:08:35,522
- What about you, Woo Shik? - What?

204
00:08:37,037 --> 00:08:38,219
Oh, I'm just...

205
00:08:41,777 --> 00:08:44,535
I'm a singer, a musician.

206
00:08:44,677 --> 00:08:45,818
You're a singer?

207
00:08:46,248 --> 00:08:48,977
Is that how you ended up singing at my wedding?

208
00:08:48,978 --> 00:08:50,735
What? That was...

209
00:08:52,687 --> 00:08:55,556
My friend, who's a wedding planner, practically begged me,

210
00:08:55,557 --> 00:08:57,072
so I had no choice but to help out.

211
00:08:57,258 --> 00:08:58,570
I see.

212
00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:01,597
Oh, right. The emcee yesterday said you're making your debut soon.

213
00:09:01,598 --> 00:09:02,708
What?

214
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:04,678
That's...

215
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:10,092
I already made my debut. The three-member co-ed dance group,

216
00:09:10,197 --> 00:09:12,055
Taj Mahal.

217
00:09:18,878 --> 00:09:20,594
Hey, hurry up.

218
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,747
Excuse me. May I quickly use the restroom?

219
00:09:24,748 --> 00:09:26,487
- Okay, be quick. - Thank you.

220
00:09:26,488 --> 00:09:28,416
- The martial arts team! - Yes, Director.

221
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:29,617
What took you guys so long?

222
00:09:29,618 --> 00:09:32,213
- Hurry! - Okay, we're coming.

223
00:09:32,457 --> 00:09:34,982
- Hey, you can't go. He's angry. - What are you doing? Hurry up!

224
00:09:35,098 --> 00:09:37,526
- Let's go. - I'll be quick.

225
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:39,026
The director is fuming mad. Didn't you see?

226
00:09:39,027 --> 00:09:40,166
Come on. Let's go!

227
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:41,796
Wait, but... Hold on. Just a second.

228
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:43,889
- Director, we're coming! - I really need to relieve myself.

229
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:46,785
Gosh, this is crazy.

230
00:09:46,968 --> 00:09:48,998
- Hey, hurry up! - I'm coming.

231
00:09:50,207 --> 00:09:52,306
And a little while ago, even BTS called me...

232
00:09:52,307 --> 00:09:54,973
to ask me for a feature in one of their songs.

233
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:57,942
You know BTS, right? The Bangtan Boys.

234
00:09:59,187 --> 00:10:01,944
I used to perform with those guys back in the old days.

235
00:10:02,488 --> 00:10:03,757
Did I tell you about the nationwide tour?

236
00:10:03,758 --> 00:10:05,987
Yes, you did. You already told me everything.

237
00:10:05,988 --> 00:10:08,956
Anyway, working nonstop like that...

238
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:11,795
started making me feel burned out.

239
00:10:12,297 --> 00:10:15,631
So I'm taking a short hiatus to recuperate.

240
00:10:17,498 --> 00:10:18,837
But you're a singer.

241
00:10:18,838 --> 00:10:20,706
Why did you open this guesthouse?

242
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:22,454
What? Oh, what happened was...

243
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,702
People from many different countries visit guesthouses, you know.

244
00:10:26,748 --> 00:10:28,536
I bought this guesthouse because I wanted...

245
00:10:28,677 --> 00:10:31,375
to communicate with those people and develop a global mindset.

246
00:10:31,888 --> 00:10:32,999
I see.

247
00:10:33,718 --> 00:10:36,748
- You're so successful now. - Gosh, cut it out.

248
00:10:42,598 --> 00:10:43,708
What about you?

249
00:10:44,358 --> 00:10:46,519
- How have you been? - Me?

250
00:10:47,728 --> 00:10:49,283
I've been well.

251
00:10:49,537 --> 00:10:52,234
Well, even though I've ended up here now.

252
00:10:54,838 --> 00:10:57,767
By the way, what's your fiance like?

253
00:10:57,878 --> 00:10:59,161
Oh, Min Seok?

254
00:11:01,348 --> 00:11:03,035
He's a wonderful person.

255
00:11:03,577 --> 00:11:06,476
He's very good to me. He really cares for me.

256
00:11:08,457 --> 00:11:09,568
I'm happy for you.

257
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:13,482
What about you? Do you have a girlfriend?

258
00:11:13,557 --> 00:11:14,668
What? Girlfriend?

259
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:18,620
I do, of course. Who?

260
00:11:19,427 --> 00:11:20,509
Music.

261
00:11:20,968 --> 00:11:23,422
I'm married to music.

262
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:26,482
Woo Shik.

263
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:35,676
Hello, ma'am. What brings you here so early?

264
00:11:35,677 --> 00:11:37,838
I came by because I missed you.

265
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,603
- By the way, who is she? - Sorry?

266
00:11:43,317 --> 00:11:45,579
She's my friend. We went to high school together.

267
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:49,783
- But she's wearing... - Oh, that.

268
00:11:50,327 --> 00:11:51,479
She's in a bit of a situation.

269
00:11:51,898 --> 00:11:53,645
Woo Shik, who is she?

270
00:11:54,197 --> 00:11:55,380
Hello.

271
00:11:55,498 --> 00:11:58,093
I'm Woo Shik's girlfriend, Kim Jeong Sook.

272
00:11:58,207 --> 00:11:59,380
We started dating three days ago.

273
00:11:59,807 --> 00:12:00,879
Pardon?

274
00:12:01,978 --> 00:12:04,229
Oh, I see.

275
00:12:05,907 --> 00:12:08,271
Woo Shik, you haven't eaten breakfast yet, right?

276
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:10,236
I picked up ingredients for samgyetang.

277
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:11,802
- I'll make it quickly for you. - No, no.

278
00:12:11,888 --> 00:12:13,887
I'm not hungry. I'm not hungry at all.

279
00:12:13,888 --> 00:12:16,210
Gosh. You can eat it later, then.

280
00:12:16,718 --> 00:12:17,869
You're such a fool.

281
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,972
Give me just a few minutes.

282
00:12:20,327 --> 00:12:22,579
It's okay. It's really okay.

283
00:12:22,628 --> 00:12:25,022
Woo Shik, you're dating her? What's going on?

284
00:12:25,297 --> 00:12:27,666
Is she really your girlfriend?

285
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:30,264
- Well, it's... - You said you're single.

286
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,767
You said you're married to music.

287
00:12:32,768 --> 00:12:34,959
Right, it's...

288
00:12:36,437 --> 00:12:39,336
Gosh, here she goes again.

289
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:42,944
To tell you the truth, my landlady is a little sick.

290
00:12:43,618 --> 00:12:44,799
In here.

291
00:12:45,018 --> 00:12:46,159
Here?

292
00:12:47,018 --> 00:12:49,109
- Hey, are you saying... - Yes.

293
00:12:49,258 --> 00:12:51,652
That's why she thinks I'm her boyfriend.

294
00:12:52,187 --> 00:12:54,511
Apparently, I look like...

295
00:12:54,628 --> 00:12:56,375
her ex-lover or something like that.

296
00:12:57,197 --> 00:12:58,338
I see.

297
00:12:59,268 --> 00:13:00,439
Hold on, your landlady?

298
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:01,910
Don't you own this place?

299
00:13:01,998 --> 00:13:03,988
What? That's...

300
00:13:05,838 --> 00:13:08,706
She used to own this building in the past.

301
00:13:08,707 --> 00:13:10,406
She still thinks that she's the owner.

302
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:13,034
- That's why she keeps coming by. - My gosh.

303
00:13:13,148 --> 00:13:15,298
Just go along with it, okay?

304
00:13:16,218 --> 00:13:18,843
- For that poor lady. - Okay, got it.

305
00:13:19,447 --> 00:13:20,962
Don't you have to call your dad?

306
00:13:21,858 --> 00:13:22,956
Right, my dad.

307
00:13:22,957 --> 00:13:24,402
- I should try calling him again. - Okay.

308
00:13:26,728 --> 00:13:28,212
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

309
00:13:29,498 --> 00:13:31,417
My gosh, ma'am.

310
00:13:31,697 --> 00:13:33,848
You didn't have to go out of your way and buy all this.

311
00:13:33,968 --> 00:13:35,566
Let's just eat out.

312
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:38,237
No, I want to cook for you.

313
00:13:38,238 --> 00:13:40,560
Still, it's too much work.

314
00:13:40,807 --> 00:13:42,394
Let's just eat out, okay?

315
00:13:44,338 --> 00:13:47,977
Woo Shik, are you ignoring my thoughtful gesture?

316
00:13:47,978 --> 00:13:50,139
No. I should eat it, of course.

317
00:13:50,518 --> 00:13:51,546
I'll eat it.

318
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:53,062
Why didn't you say that sooner?

319
00:13:54,348 --> 00:13:55,631
My gosh, I'm so forgetful.

320
00:13:56,258 --> 00:13:58,036
I forgot to buy green onions.

321
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:01,183
- Do you have green onions? - Green onions? No.

322
00:14:01,358 --> 00:14:03,956
Then could you step out and pick up a bunch of green onions for me?

323
00:14:03,957 --> 00:14:05,988
I can't make samgyetang without green onions.

324
00:14:06,197 --> 00:14:08,420
- Be quick. - Oh, sure.

325
00:14:18,307 --> 00:14:19,358
Hi, son.

326
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:21,287
Me?

327
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:23,461
I'm at Woo Shik's place.

328
00:14:24,478 --> 00:14:26,266
What? You're sick?

329
00:14:26,988 --> 00:14:27,998
How?

330
00:14:28,258 --> 00:14:31,489
Which part hurts the most?

331
00:14:31,628 --> 00:14:32,667
What?

332
00:14:33,187 --> 00:14:34,269
Legs?

333
00:14:34,787 --> 00:14:36,847
You're a big boy. Don't make such a fuss.

334
00:14:37,758 --> 00:14:40,353
Do you want some massage?

335
00:14:42,638 --> 00:14:43,677
No?

336
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:45,281
What about acupuncture?

337
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:48,727
Hang in there.

338
00:14:49,937 --> 00:14:51,927
After getting acupuncture...

339
00:14:52,378 --> 00:14:54,569
and taking a hot bath,

340
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,563
you'll feel much better.

341
00:15:00,588 --> 00:15:01,628
All right.

342
00:15:02,518 --> 00:15:03,830
Get some good rest.

343
00:15:05,728 --> 00:15:07,879
My goodness. I feel so sorry.

344
00:15:12,197 --> 00:15:14,318
What's with her? What happened?

345
00:15:22,537 --> 00:15:23,547
I really need to pee.

346
00:15:24,238 --> 00:15:25,977
This is crazy.

347
00:15:25,978 --> 00:15:27,076
Gosh.

348
00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:29,046
We're all set. Where is Min?

349
00:15:29,047 --> 00:15:30,517
He's on the phone.

350
00:15:30,518 --> 00:15:32,946
We're in a hurry. Why is he still on the phone?

351
00:15:32,947 --> 00:15:34,987
What is he thinking?

352
00:15:34,988 --> 00:15:36,456
I'm sorry.

353
00:15:36,457 --> 00:15:37,872
The lead actor isn't here yet.

354
00:15:37,957 --> 00:15:40,109
Maybe I should tell him I have to use the bathroom.

355
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:42,142
- Well... - Director.

356
00:15:43,197 --> 00:15:45,267
Can I use the bathroom?

357
00:15:45,268 --> 00:15:46,597
The bathroom?

358
00:15:46,598 --> 00:15:49,295
Is he out of his mind or what?

359
00:15:49,368 --> 00:15:51,867
The shooting is about to start.

360
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,089
Do you expect the whole staff to wait for you while you pee?

361
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:56,732
Assistant director, drag him out.

362
00:15:56,807 --> 00:15:59,076
I can't work with such a selfish jerk.

363
00:15:59,077 --> 00:16:01,067
- Drag him out! - Yes, Director. I'm sorry.

364
00:16:01,447 --> 00:16:03,546
- Hey, you're out. - Hurry up!

365
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:06,087
I'm sorry, Director. Please forgive me this once.

366
00:16:06,088 --> 00:16:07,647
Drag him out right now!

367
00:16:07,648 --> 00:16:10,656
I don't want to work with him ever again. Understood?

368
00:16:10,657 --> 00:16:12,257
- Drag him out! - Sorry.

369
00:16:12,258 --> 00:16:13,956
- I don't need to pee anymore. - Let's go.

370
00:16:13,957 --> 00:16:16,357
Spend the rest of your life in the bathroom!

371
00:16:16,358 --> 00:16:17,368
Director!

372
00:16:17,427 --> 00:16:19,526
What is it? You have something to say?

373
00:16:19,527 --> 00:16:20,577
Sorry? No...

374
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,084
No, I don't.

375
00:16:25,368 --> 00:16:26,378
Let's do this.

376
00:16:26,807 --> 00:16:28,283
Gosh, you startled me.

377
00:16:29,677 --> 00:16:32,980
How can an actor be so unprofessional?

378
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:36,946
Oh, my. I'm sorry.

379
00:16:36,947 --> 00:16:38,290
Min!

380
00:16:39,988 --> 00:16:40,998
I'm late, right?

381
00:16:42,157 --> 00:16:44,556
My dog is sick, so I had to talk to him on the phone.

382
00:16:44,557 --> 00:16:46,507
No problem.

383
00:16:46,628 --> 00:16:48,921
This shooting is no big deal...

384
00:16:49,098 --> 00:16:52,097
compared to your dog's health.

385
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:54,367
Thank you for understanding.

386
00:16:54,368 --> 00:16:56,196
Don't say that.

387
00:16:56,197 --> 00:16:58,436
It's such an honor...

388
00:16:58,437 --> 00:17:00,306
for me to work with a top star like you.

389
00:17:00,307 --> 00:17:04,378
Anyway, let's make this scene really great.

390
00:17:05,378 --> 00:17:07,468
Okay?

391
00:17:08,048 --> 00:17:09,088
Okay?

392
00:17:13,447 --> 00:17:14,587
What are you doing?

393
00:17:14,588 --> 00:17:15,598
What?

394
00:17:15,858 --> 00:17:18,117
This is how I express my affection.

395
00:17:18,118 --> 00:17:19,198
I don't like it.

396
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:28,562
You can do this. Jun Ki, you can do this.

397
00:17:28,638 --> 00:17:29,911
Ready!

398
00:17:30,868 --> 00:17:31,948
Action!

399
00:17:38,177 --> 00:17:39,663
Are you Bi Dam?

400
00:17:40,648 --> 00:17:43,547
Yes, I am. Do you need anything?

401
00:17:43,548 --> 00:17:45,466
Do I need anything? Yes, I do.

402
00:17:45,747 --> 00:17:47,587
My master wants...

403
00:17:47,588 --> 00:17:49,638
- your head... - Director!

404
00:17:49,687 --> 00:17:51,186
Just a second.

405
00:17:51,187 --> 00:17:53,309
Cut! What's wrong?

406
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:55,426
What is it, Min?

407
00:17:55,427 --> 00:17:57,720
I think this scene is a bit boring.

408
00:17:57,757 --> 00:17:58,766
You think so?

409
00:17:58,767 --> 00:18:00,666
Instead of him just saying the line...

410
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:01,677
Yes?

411
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:04,397
How about he takes my cup...

412
00:18:04,398 --> 00:18:06,690
and drinks my makgeolli?

413
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:09,800
He drinks your makgeolli?

414
00:18:10,177 --> 00:18:13,915
That's a fantastic idea.

415
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:16,097
I can see why you're a top star.

416
00:18:16,618 --> 00:18:19,475
Okay?

417
00:18:20,618 --> 00:18:23,315
I said, stop. What's with you?

418
00:18:23,487 --> 00:18:24,686
I'm sorry.

419
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,956
Like Min said,

420
00:18:26,957 --> 00:18:28,256
you drink his makgeolli...

421
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:29,726
before you say your line, okay?

422
00:18:29,727 --> 00:18:31,344
- Let's go. - Just a second.

423
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:35,174
You want me to drink this?

424
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:40,247
What?

425
00:18:40,838 --> 00:18:41,918
You don't want to?

426
00:18:42,338 --> 00:18:44,661
Sure, I want to.

427
00:18:46,907 --> 00:18:48,735
Scene 35, 1-1.

428
00:18:49,578 --> 00:18:50,628
Action!

429
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:06,443
Are you Bi Dam?

430
00:19:06,568 --> 00:19:08,244
- Yes. - Cut!

431
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:11,217
Well, Min...

432
00:19:11,368 --> 00:19:12,906
It's not just "Yes".

433
00:19:12,907 --> 00:19:15,765
It's "Yes, I am."

434
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:18,547
"Yes, I am."

435
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:19,746
I'm sorry. Let's try again.

436
00:19:19,747 --> 00:19:20,946
Again?

437
00:19:20,947 --> 00:19:21,987
"Yes, I am."

438
00:19:22,048 --> 00:19:23,491
Let's try again.

439
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:38,467
Are you Bi Dam...

440
00:19:39,398 --> 00:19:40,466
- Dust! - Cut!

441
00:19:40,467 --> 00:19:42,436
Get rid of this dust! I can't act like this.

442
00:19:42,437 --> 00:19:43,710
- I can't... - Take four.

443
00:19:45,507 --> 00:19:47,053
- Are you Bi Dam? - There's a bug.

444
00:19:47,507 --> 00:19:48,837
Kill those bugs.

445
00:19:48,838 --> 00:19:49,918
Take five.

446
00:19:53,378 --> 00:19:54,993
- Are you Bi Dam? - Let's try again.

447
00:19:56,017 --> 00:19:57,058
Again?

448
00:19:58,148 --> 00:19:59,516
I'm full. Are you Bi dam...

449
00:19:59,517 --> 00:20:00,902
Let's do it again.

450
00:20:01,318 --> 00:20:02,328
Again.

451
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:22,493
Are you Bi Dam?

452
00:20:23,078 --> 00:20:24,088
Yes, I am.

453
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:26,746
Do you need anything?

454
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:27,788
Do I need anything?

455
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,392
Yes, I do, in fact.

456
00:20:30,148 --> 00:20:32,005
My master wants...

457
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,233
- your head! - Cut!

458
00:20:34,618 --> 00:20:37,082
Hey, what are you doing right now?

459
00:20:40,227 --> 00:20:42,456
Why are you crossing your legs?

460
00:20:42,457 --> 00:20:43,996
Do you want to seduce him?

461
00:20:43,997 --> 00:20:45,543
Are you his maid?

462
00:20:45,697 --> 00:20:47,717
You're an assassin.

463
00:20:47,828 --> 00:20:50,236
What kind of assassin crosses his legs in such a sexy way?

464
00:20:50,237 --> 00:20:51,247
I'm sorry.

465
00:20:51,697 --> 00:20:53,506
Let's go back to the part where he drinks the makgeolli.

466
00:20:53,507 --> 00:20:54,936
Fill up the bottle!

467
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:56,291
Hurry up and fill it.

468
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,358
Fill it up, okay?

469
00:21:01,747 --> 00:21:03,162
That sound...

470
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:13,147
Eat a lot, Woo Shik.

471
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:14,974
Okay. Thank you.

472
00:21:17,398 --> 00:21:20,054
Oh, I was about to come and get you.

473
00:21:20,528 --> 00:21:22,966
Have a seat and eat with us.

474
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:24,696
No. I asked her,

475
00:21:24,697 --> 00:21:26,283
- and she doesn't want to eat. - It's okay, Woo Shik.

476
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:29,734
She made all this food in her condition.

477
00:21:30,078 --> 00:21:31,249
I should eat.

478
00:21:35,108 --> 00:21:36,562
Thank you.

479
00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:40,887
Oh, it looks so tasty.

480
00:21:40,888 --> 00:21:42,357
Soo Yeon, let's eat.

481
00:21:42,358 --> 00:21:43,771
Let's eat.

482
00:21:43,818 --> 00:21:45,443
Okay.

483
00:21:47,288 --> 00:21:48,671
You seem to like it.

484
00:21:48,898 --> 00:21:49,968
Slow down.

485
00:21:50,398 --> 00:21:51,437
It tastes so good.

486
00:21:52,467 --> 00:21:54,214
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

487
00:21:57,697 --> 00:21:59,859
What do you think? Does it taste okay?

488
00:22:03,078 --> 00:22:04,118
My goodness.

489
00:22:04,308 --> 00:22:05,307
What's wrong?

490
00:22:05,308 --> 00:22:07,570
You have something on your face.

491
00:22:08,278 --> 00:22:10,267
Hold on. Let me wipe it off.

492
00:22:14,318 --> 00:22:15,570
There you go.

493
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,656
If it's too much trouble,

494
00:22:18,657 --> 00:22:21,082
should I feed you?

495
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:22,737
What?

496
00:22:23,957 --> 00:22:26,997
That's not necessary.

497
00:22:27,068 --> 00:22:29,391
Or should I debone the chicken for you?

498
00:22:29,937 --> 00:22:33,342
No. I can do it myself.

499
00:22:34,507 --> 00:22:35,517
Then again,

500
00:22:36,237 --> 00:22:37,652
I saw something on TV.

501
00:22:37,907 --> 00:22:41,312
You should try to do things yourself even if it's hard.

502
00:22:44,078 --> 00:22:45,088
Well...

503
00:22:47,517 --> 00:22:48,931
Thank you for the food.

504
00:22:52,328 --> 00:22:54,246
I feel so sorry for her condition.

505
00:22:56,128 --> 00:22:57,527
My condition?

506
00:22:57,528 --> 00:22:59,688
What did she just say?

507
00:23:00,227 --> 00:23:02,157
She wiped my face...

508
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:04,056
and wanted to feed me.

509
00:23:04,898 --> 00:23:05,966
What's with her?

510
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,280
Well...

511
00:23:08,068 --> 00:23:09,654
The thing is...

512
00:23:10,437 --> 00:23:13,204
Oh, my. There she goes again.

513
00:23:13,707 --> 00:23:15,969
In fact, she has a little problem...

514
00:23:16,717 --> 00:23:18,737
- in her head. - In her head?

515
00:23:21,687 --> 00:23:23,102
Do you mean...

516
00:23:26,227 --> 00:23:27,557
What happened?

517
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:29,476
Her wedding was called off,

518
00:23:29,598 --> 00:23:31,213
and she is in shock.

519
00:23:31,227 --> 00:23:32,581
- Really? - Yes.

520
00:23:36,068 --> 00:23:38,188
All right. We don't have much time.

521
00:23:38,437 --> 00:23:40,666
Let's finish it at once, okay?

522
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:41,717
- Okay. - Okay.

523
00:23:42,278 --> 00:23:43,288
Action!

524
00:23:49,947 --> 00:23:51,392
Cut!

525
00:23:51,648 --> 00:23:53,567
Hey, what's wrong with you?

526
00:23:54,217 --> 00:23:55,916
Why do you run like that?

527
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:57,216
Is this race walking?

528
00:23:57,217 --> 00:23:59,686
- I'm sorry. - You have to look tough.

529
00:23:59,687 --> 00:24:02,525
Charge at him determinedly.

530
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:03,871
Let's try again.

531
00:24:04,128 --> 00:24:05,138
Let's go!

532
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:10,019
- Hurry up! - All right.

533
00:24:13,167 --> 00:24:14,278
Ready.

534
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:19,159
Action!

535
00:24:27,618 --> 00:24:29,608
- Wait, wait. - Cut!

536
00:24:30,288 --> 00:24:31,772
Wait, I'm bursting.

537
00:24:32,328 --> 00:24:34,853
He barely hit you. What's all the big fuss about?

538
00:24:35,128 --> 00:24:36,238
I'm sorry.

539
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,173
What's wrong with you? We don't even have time.

540
00:24:38,528 --> 00:24:41,932
If you do this again, I'm going to change the actor, so do it properly.

541
00:24:42,128 --> 00:24:43,208
No, please.

542
00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:46,362
I can do it. You can leave it up to me.

543
00:24:46,707 --> 00:24:47,747
I can do...

544
00:24:48,267 --> 00:24:49,652
I must bear the pain no matter what.

545
00:24:50,507 --> 00:24:52,599
I went through so much to get this role.

546
00:25:01,187 --> 00:25:04,087
Ma'am, why don't we just go out for some coffee?

547
00:25:04,088 --> 00:25:05,673
No way.

548
00:25:05,888 --> 00:25:09,230
I even ground coffee beans for you, Woo Shik.

549
00:25:10,957 --> 00:25:13,554
- Isn't the aroma so nice? - What?

550
00:25:14,028 --> 00:25:16,764
- Yes, it's lovely. - I'm home.

551
00:25:17,838 --> 00:25:19,988
- Ma'am. - Jung Eun, you're here.

552
00:25:20,368 --> 00:25:21,637
Would you like a cup of coffee?

553
00:25:21,638 --> 00:25:23,900
What? No, I'm fine.

554
00:25:24,477 --> 00:25:26,467
Come on, join us for some coffee.

555
00:25:34,947 --> 00:25:37,887
- I feel so bad for her. - What? For what?

556
00:25:38,157 --> 00:25:39,643
That lady over there.

557
00:25:40,757 --> 00:25:42,444
I heard there's something wrong with her head.

558
00:25:42,727 --> 00:25:44,272
What? Soo Yeon?

559
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:45,539
You didn't know?

560
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:47,618
I heard she's mentally ill.

561
00:25:47,967 --> 00:25:49,466
That's what Woo Shik told me.

562
00:25:49,467 --> 00:25:51,619
- What? That's totally... - Hey.

563
00:25:51,737 --> 00:25:53,337
What about that favor I asked you for?

564
00:25:53,338 --> 00:25:56,137
- Favor? What favor? - How could you forget that!

565
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,258
- What? - You and I should have a talk.

566
00:25:58,477 --> 00:26:00,367
What are you doing?

567
00:26:00,608 --> 00:26:02,062
He's so manly.

568
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,516
What? Soo Yeon thinks the landlady is crazy...

569
00:26:06,517 --> 00:26:07,516
and the landlady thinks...

570
00:26:07,517 --> 00:26:09,274
- Soo Yeon is crazy? - Yes.

571
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:11,740
Why did you lie in the first place?

572
00:26:11,957 --> 00:26:13,226
A famous singer?

573
00:26:13,227 --> 00:26:14,571
Getting married to music?

574
00:26:15,187 --> 00:26:18,430
Jung Eun. That's what a first love means to a man.

575
00:26:18,697 --> 00:26:20,717
I always want to show her the cool side of me...

576
00:26:20,927 --> 00:26:23,018
- and leave only good memories... - Quiet.

577
00:26:23,338 --> 00:26:25,607
You've all lost your minds because of your first love.

578
00:26:25,608 --> 00:26:26,807
Anyway, pretend you don't know.

579
00:26:26,808 --> 00:26:28,323
It'll be a disaster if they find out. Okay?

580
00:26:35,207 --> 00:26:37,676
Let's throw 10 more pitches...

581
00:26:37,677 --> 00:26:39,232
- and end today's training. - Yes, Coach.

582
00:26:39,917 --> 00:26:42,987
- Coach. - Gosh, it's my favorite rookie.

583
00:26:43,017 --> 00:26:44,656
Your training is over. Why did you come back?

584
00:26:44,657 --> 00:26:47,658
I went to take a shower, but the water isn't coming out.

585
00:26:48,058 --> 00:26:50,456
I'm afraid the shower head is broken. What should I do?

586
00:26:50,457 --> 00:26:52,316
That's unacceptable.

587
00:26:52,628 --> 00:26:55,192
Ki Bong, go and fix it.

588
00:26:55,298 --> 00:26:57,466
- Me? - Then should I go fix it?

589
00:26:57,467 --> 00:26:58,650
No.

590
00:26:59,138 --> 00:27:01,807
Hey, just go take a shower in another stall.

591
00:27:01,808 --> 00:27:03,676
After I finish my training,

592
00:27:03,677 --> 00:27:07,344
I must always take a shower at the third stall on the right.

593
00:27:07,548 --> 00:27:09,516
- It's my routine. - Routine?

594
00:27:09,517 --> 00:27:12,779
Otherwise, it keeps bugging me, and it affects my performance.

595
00:27:12,848 --> 00:27:14,838
What are you doing? Get over there and fix it.

596
00:27:15,148 --> 00:27:17,915
- My training isn't over yet. - That's not important at all.

597
00:27:18,088 --> 00:27:20,557
He's going to be drafted to the major league soon.

598
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:22,327
If he's in bad shape and fails to be drafted,

599
00:27:22,328 --> 00:27:23,827
will you take responsibility for it?

600
00:27:23,828 --> 00:27:26,756
Fine, then. I'll go fix that darn shower head.

601
00:27:26,997 --> 00:27:28,139
How dare you give me an attitude?

602
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:33,787
Why is he making me fix this?

603
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:36,359
There's no place for an incompetent player like me.

604
00:27:38,638 --> 00:27:41,031
Wait. Why isn't the water coming out?

605
00:27:41,507 --> 00:27:42,629
Darn.

606
00:27:47,388 --> 00:27:49,913
Wait. Something seems to be stuck inside.

607
00:27:53,157 --> 00:27:55,855
Goodness. It's stuck really tight.

608
00:28:01,898 --> 00:28:03,008
I must block it.

609
00:28:03,167 --> 00:28:04,897
I must block it with my life.

610
00:28:04,898 --> 00:28:07,867
The most important thing for this scene is your eyes.

611
00:28:08,068 --> 00:28:10,361
You must stare at the opponent with murderous eyes.

612
00:28:10,477 --> 00:28:13,507
Like an insane man. This scene needs the madness.

613
00:28:13,578 --> 00:28:15,264
All right, let's do this.

614
00:28:16,148 --> 00:28:17,794
There is only one scene left.

615
00:28:18,878 --> 00:28:20,908
I'll finish it in one go.

616
00:28:21,747 --> 00:28:23,357
In one go.

617
00:28:23,358 --> 00:28:24,468
Ready!

618
00:28:25,058 --> 00:28:26,198
Action!

619
00:28:30,227 --> 00:28:31,369
Cut!

620
00:28:33,267 --> 00:28:34,567
I'm sorry, sir.

621
00:28:34,568 --> 00:28:36,254
My shoe. What is that doing here?

622
00:28:36,467 --> 00:28:38,184
Goodness, we're short on time.

623
00:28:38,737 --> 00:28:40,307
Costume team, what are you guys doing?

624
00:28:40,308 --> 00:28:42,086
Hey, Min.

625
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:45,036
We don't have time, so I need you to focus.

626
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:47,468
Kang Min, you better get your act together!

627
00:28:47,878 --> 00:28:49,230
Are you planning on shooting all day?

628
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:51,538
We don't have time!

629
00:28:53,747 --> 00:28:55,839
Please, help me.

630
00:28:58,187 --> 00:29:00,247
Hey, what is wrong with you?

631
00:29:00,528 --> 00:29:01,841
- Are you mad? - Quiet!

632
00:29:01,888 --> 00:29:03,745
You go and shoot!

633
00:29:07,628 --> 00:29:09,960
Hey, what's the matter with you?

634
00:29:11,838 --> 00:29:14,060
Are you immersed in your role right now?

635
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,297
Guys, did you all see that?

636
00:29:16,378 --> 00:29:18,832
- Those are the eyes that I want! - Quiet!

637
00:29:19,747 --> 00:29:23,077
You're distracting me when I'm trying to concentrate.

638
00:29:23,078 --> 00:29:25,876
- Go! - Let's do it before you lose focus.

639
00:29:25,987 --> 00:29:27,199
Good. You're doing great!

640
00:29:27,818 --> 00:29:30,009
Good! All right, let's do it.

641
00:29:30,088 --> 00:29:31,876
- Focus! - Ready.

642
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:34,668
Action!

643
00:29:53,977 --> 00:29:55,665
I'll be waiting in the afterlife,

644
00:29:56,848 --> 00:29:57,928
Bi Dam.

645
00:30:05,217 --> 00:30:07,486
Cut! Okay!

646
00:30:07,487 --> 00:30:09,851
That was great. It was amazing. Give him a hand.

647
00:30:10,858 --> 00:30:12,473
- It was nothing. - I'm impressed.

648
00:30:12,568 --> 00:30:13,810
Look at him.

649
00:30:13,898 --> 00:30:16,160
He has some true talent for acting.

650
00:30:17,338 --> 00:30:19,206
Sir, are we finished then?

651
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:20,436
Yes, of course.

652
00:30:20,437 --> 00:30:22,436
Hey, it's cold. You should get up.

653
00:30:22,437 --> 00:30:24,528
Wow, wasn't he amazing?

654
00:30:24,638 --> 00:30:27,031
Let's give him a big hand. What are you all doing?

655
00:30:29,007 --> 00:30:30,361
That was some great acting.

656
00:30:30,517 --> 00:30:32,296
- Good job... - Don't touch me!

657
00:30:36,457 --> 00:30:39,719
I have to go. I must go now...

658
00:30:41,157 --> 00:30:43,117
- But... - Great job today.

659
00:30:44,657 --> 00:30:45,980
But he's...

660
00:30:47,167 --> 00:30:48,278
Hold on right there.

661
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:54,167
I'm hoping to work with you on my next movie. What do you say?

662
00:30:54,608 --> 00:30:55,837
Yes, sure.

663
00:30:55,838 --> 00:30:58,766
So... let's talk about that later.

664
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:00,277
Later.

665
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:02,772
Come on, where are you going?

666
00:31:03,217 --> 00:31:04,877
Are you playing hard to get with me?

667
00:31:04,878 --> 00:31:08,150
No, I'm in a bit of a hurry right now.

668
00:31:10,388 --> 00:31:13,518
What on earth is stuck in here? It's not coming out.

669
00:31:14,888 --> 00:31:16,847
What? What's wrong?

670
00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:19,485
Let go of me!

671
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:22,282
Gosh. Anyway...

672
00:31:22,568 --> 00:31:25,769
I really loved your acting today. Loved it.

673
00:31:29,167 --> 00:31:31,299
It came out. A drop came out.

674
00:31:40,048 --> 00:31:41,129
Come out.

675
00:31:41,318 --> 00:31:42,887
It came out again. Nice.

676
00:31:42,888 --> 00:31:44,070
One more drop.

677
00:31:46,157 --> 00:31:48,077
One more time. Come on.

678
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:49,369
One more time!

679
00:31:56,868 --> 00:31:59,220
I did it! It's coming out!

680
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:01,328
It's coming out!

681
00:32:04,538 --> 00:32:07,174
(Heuksando Tavern)

682
00:32:08,848 --> 00:32:12,281
Hey, what is wrong with your face?

683
00:32:12,318 --> 00:32:13,701
What's wrong?

684
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,099
What the heck?

685
00:32:18,058 --> 00:32:19,603
What is that liquid?

686
00:32:20,088 --> 00:32:21,945
Are you...

687
00:32:22,427 --> 00:32:23,812
peeing in your pants?

688
00:32:38,007 --> 00:32:40,301
- That's so dirty. - I haven't seen a grownup like him.

689
00:32:40,808 --> 00:32:41,889
Did you see that?

690
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,716
- This color looks perfect on you. - What?

691
00:32:46,717 --> 00:32:47,929
Yes, it does.

692
00:32:48,247 --> 00:32:50,884
Ma'am, you should go now. It's getting late.

693
00:32:51,058 --> 00:32:53,583
Oh, my. I didn't realize it was so late.

694
00:32:53,927 --> 00:32:57,433
Gosh, I just lose track of time whenever I'm with you.

695
00:32:57,628 --> 00:32:59,072
You should get up now.

696
00:32:59,298 --> 00:33:01,419
I don't want to say goodbye.

697
00:33:02,298 --> 00:33:04,097
Should I just stay here tonight?

698
00:33:04,098 --> 00:33:06,360
What? Don't say something so absurd...

699
00:33:07,267 --> 00:33:08,666
Your son must be waiting for you.

700
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:09,950
I was kidding.

701
00:33:10,838 --> 00:33:13,206
Instead, you'll walk me home, right?

702
00:33:13,207 --> 00:33:16,076
What? Yes, of course.

703
00:33:16,278 --> 00:33:18,369
I'll go and get my jacket.

704
00:33:20,548 --> 00:33:22,032
He's just adorable.

705
00:33:24,687 --> 00:33:28,829
Goodness. I fixed a shower head all day for that arrogant junior.

706
00:33:30,358 --> 00:33:33,661
I'm going to succeed by all means and get my revenge.

707
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:35,539
Oh, my gosh.

708
00:33:36,197 --> 00:33:37,309
Who is that?

709
00:33:43,477 --> 00:33:45,660
What on earth? Is it a madman?

710
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:53,740
- Jun Ki. - Ki Bong.

711
00:33:54,048 --> 00:33:55,401
What are you doing here?

712
00:33:55,648 --> 00:33:56,887
What's that outfit?

713
00:33:56,888 --> 00:33:59,140
Ki Bong!

714
00:33:59,257 --> 00:34:00,671
What's the matter?

715
00:34:02,288 --> 00:34:04,721
Hey! What is that smell?

716
00:34:07,727 --> 00:34:08,777
Oh no, Jun Ki!

717
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:13,258
You stink! Don't move! Stay still.

718
00:34:13,637 --> 00:34:15,123
Gosh, seriously!

719
00:34:18,508 --> 00:34:20,700
My goodness, that poor thing.

720
00:34:24,318 --> 00:34:25,547
What is that?

721
00:34:25,548 --> 00:34:27,669
Why did they put that plant there?

722
00:34:29,687 --> 00:34:31,506
Gosh, what on earth is that?

723
00:34:31,517 --> 00:34:34,326
What's that photo doing up there? It makes the place look untidy.

724
00:34:34,327 --> 00:34:35,427
Oh, that?

725
00:34:35,428 --> 00:34:38,356
They're covering the hole from the time when a meteorite fell.

726
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:39,408
What?

727
00:34:40,227 --> 00:34:41,277
A meteorite?

728
00:34:41,628 --> 00:34:44,264
Yes. Do you not know what a meteorite is?

729
00:34:44,437 --> 00:34:46,237
A rock from the universe.

730
00:34:46,238 --> 00:34:48,430
My gosh, you poor thing.

731
00:34:51,977 --> 00:34:54,170
Come to your senses, young lady.

732
00:34:54,648 --> 00:34:56,877
You have such a pretty face.

733
00:34:56,878 --> 00:34:59,070
What happened that you've lost your mind like this?

734
00:34:59,247 --> 00:35:02,015
Sorry? I beg your pardon? Who?

735
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,780
- Me? - Obviously. Would it be me, then?

736
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,674
Gosh, forget it.

737
00:35:07,187 --> 00:35:09,527
Why bother having a conversation with a girl who's not all there?

738
00:35:09,528 --> 00:35:11,679
What are you talking about?

739
00:35:12,258 --> 00:35:14,115
Gosh, I can't believe this.

740
00:35:15,227 --> 00:35:16,266
Whatever, forget it.

741
00:35:16,267 --> 00:35:18,567
Crazy people think everyone is crazy.

742
00:35:18,568 --> 00:35:19,618
What?

743
00:35:19,968 --> 00:35:21,507
"Crazy"?

744
00:35:21,508 --> 00:35:23,136
Who? Me?

745
00:35:23,137 --> 00:35:24,855
Obviously. Would it be me, then?

746
00:35:25,238 --> 00:35:28,237
The guys told me that a meteorite fell here through the ceiling.

747
00:35:30,477 --> 00:35:31,527
Do you want to see it?

748
00:35:37,588 --> 00:35:39,335
- Right here. - What is that?

749
00:35:41,827 --> 00:35:42,837
And this too.

750
00:35:46,827 --> 00:35:49,266
Here. Now, do you believe me?

751
00:35:49,267 --> 00:35:51,067
My gosh, what on earth is that?

752
00:35:51,068 --> 00:35:53,431
Ma'am, let's go.

753
00:35:54,537 --> 00:35:56,830
Woo Shik, what is that?

754
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,050
What is all this?

755
00:35:59,707 --> 00:36:01,576
What happened?

756
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:03,467
Well, what happened was...

757
00:36:03,548 --> 00:36:04,790
We're home.

758
00:36:07,588 --> 00:36:08,786
- Ma'am. - Hello.

759
00:36:08,787 --> 00:36:10,737
Gosh, Mr. Lee. What happened to you?

760
00:36:11,117 --> 00:36:13,784
No, we have something more important to discuss.

761
00:36:14,327 --> 00:36:17,024
Did the two of you know about it too?

762
00:36:17,597 --> 00:36:20,456
You all knew about it? You guys have been fooling me all along?

763
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:22,677
What?

764
00:36:23,437 --> 00:36:25,216
You'd better tell me the truth!

765
00:36:25,968 --> 00:36:26,978
Don't.

766
00:36:31,338 --> 00:36:35,013
Woo Shik, why did you lie to her in the first place?

767
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:38,612
You shouldn't have lied to her that you love her.

768
00:36:39,148 --> 00:36:40,663
- What is this nonsense now? - Sorry?

769
00:36:41,017 --> 00:36:43,310
He lied to me that he loves me?

770
00:36:43,617 --> 00:36:46,586
Isn't that what you were asking us about?

771
00:36:49,898 --> 00:36:52,322
Woo Shik, you tell me.

772
00:36:53,068 --> 00:36:55,855
Was that really a lie?

773
00:36:56,028 --> 00:36:58,826
Sorry? Well, it was...

774
00:37:03,608 --> 00:37:05,759
What's going on? Why does everyone look so tense?

775
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:07,525
Jung Eun, did you know about it too?

776
00:37:07,908 --> 00:37:10,574
Did you know that Woo Shik was lying to me?

777
00:37:11,477 --> 00:37:12,487
Pardon?

778
00:37:13,847 --> 00:37:17,353
Well, it's... I mean...

779
00:37:18,758 --> 00:37:19,797
Well...

780
00:37:20,687 --> 00:37:24,767
Woo Shik, why did you call Ms. Kim crazy?

781
00:37:24,858 --> 00:37:28,231
She's completely sane. It's wrong to call someone like her crazy.

782
00:37:28,867 --> 00:37:30,655
- "Crazy"? - What is this nonsense now?

783
00:37:31,537 --> 00:37:32,710
"Crazy"?

784
00:37:33,307 --> 00:37:35,155
Who? Me?

785
00:37:35,437 --> 00:37:38,135
Woo Shik, so this lady isn't crazy?

786
00:37:38,637 --> 00:37:40,163
Earlier, you said she's not all there.

787
00:37:41,307 --> 00:37:43,974
He even said to you that I'm crazy?

788
00:37:48,488 --> 00:37:50,377
Is it really true?

789
00:37:52,818 --> 00:37:54,807
- I can explain... - You, Cha Woo Shik!

790
00:37:55,258 --> 00:37:58,358
I shall teach you a serious lesson today.

791
00:38:01,767 --> 00:38:03,110
Gosh, wait!

792
00:38:04,698 --> 00:38:06,213
Calm down, please!

793
00:38:14,807 --> 00:38:19,191
(Seized)

794
00:38:22,687 --> 00:38:23,929
What do we do now?

795
00:38:24,088 --> 00:38:26,427
I thought she'd kick us out right away,

796
00:38:26,428 --> 00:38:27,943
but she gave us a day.

797
00:38:28,727 --> 00:38:30,127
We should be grateful.

798
00:38:30,128 --> 00:38:31,946
Grateful, my foot!

799
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:34,496
Hey, she put "seized" stickers on everything...

800
00:38:34,497 --> 00:38:36,356
and asked for 10,000 dollars by the end of today.

801
00:38:36,597 --> 00:38:38,820
She's basically kicking us out, don't you think?

802
00:38:39,097 --> 00:38:41,007
Why did you lie to her in the first place?

803
00:38:41,008 --> 00:38:43,007
I'm sorry. I didn't expect this to happen.

804
00:38:43,008 --> 00:38:45,136
You were going on about men and their first loves.

805
00:38:45,137 --> 00:38:47,177
- You sure impressed her. - Even you're being mean to me?

806
00:38:47,178 --> 00:38:48,461
I already feel horrible.

807
00:38:49,718 --> 00:38:52,071
By the way, how are we going to get that kind of money by today?

808
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,500
- Hey! - What? Ouch!

809
00:38:54,847 --> 00:38:55,959
Hey, be careful!

810
00:38:56,117 --> 00:38:58,386
You shouldn't be leisurely trimming your nose hair right now.

811
00:38:58,387 --> 00:39:00,176
I was thinking while trimming my nose hair, okay?

812
00:39:00,428 --> 00:39:01,740
What can we do?

813
00:39:02,658 --> 00:39:04,797
We should just beg our acquaintances to lend us some money.

814
00:39:04,798 --> 00:39:06,996
I'll try to borrow some money from the guys on my team.

815
00:39:06,997 --> 00:39:10,096
Me too. I'll see if I can get paid in advance.

816
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,249
I'm going to work.

817
00:39:11,338 --> 00:39:12,348
See you later.

818
00:39:14,537 --> 00:39:16,436
Guys, we should get moving too.

819
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,831
Yes, let's get going. Sitting around like this won't help us.

820
00:39:20,178 --> 00:39:21,289
Let's go.

821
00:39:21,477 --> 00:39:22,719
Aren't you bleeding in there?

822
00:39:23,218 --> 00:39:25,476
Soo Yeon, do you need anything?

823
00:39:25,477 --> 00:39:28,487
No, it's not that. I should get going now.

824
00:39:28,488 --> 00:39:29,498
Now?

825
00:39:29,648 --> 00:39:31,335
You said you still can't get a hold of your dad.

826
00:39:31,517 --> 00:39:34,114
- Where will you go? - I want to go home and check.

827
00:39:35,128 --> 00:39:36,612
That being said,

828
00:39:36,727 --> 00:39:38,445
can you guys take me home?

829
00:39:39,327 --> 00:39:40,337
Us?

830
00:39:40,497 --> 00:39:43,567
Sorry. We have to take care of something urgent, so we can't.

831
00:39:43,568 --> 00:39:45,658
Come on. Just give me a ride.

832
00:39:46,908 --> 00:39:48,120
I'll give you this in exchange.

833
00:39:48,807 --> 00:39:49,817
What's this?

834
00:39:51,137 --> 00:39:53,369
Isn't this your wedding dress?

835
00:39:54,577 --> 00:39:56,047
Hey, this is of no use to us.

836
00:39:56,048 --> 00:39:57,360
It's from a high-end designer brand.

837
00:39:58,178 --> 00:40:01,045
I know it's used, but you can still sell it for 5,000 dollars.

838
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,230
Give it back if you don't want it.

839
00:40:03,858 --> 00:40:05,130
Where's your place again?

840
00:40:08,158 --> 00:40:11,794
(Magical Princess Minky)

841
00:40:11,798 --> 00:40:12,969
- Mr. Han! - Come on out!

842
00:40:14,568 --> 00:40:16,496
- I want my money back! - Come out!

843
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,618
- You need to pay us back! - Come out, Mr. Han!

844
00:40:18,637 --> 00:40:20,337
See? What did I tell you?

845
00:40:20,338 --> 00:40:22,036
I said creditors would be camping out here.

846
00:40:22,037 --> 00:40:23,624
What should I do, then?

847
00:40:24,378 --> 00:40:26,846
Soo Yeon, how about we go to your dad's office?

848
00:40:26,847 --> 00:40:29,047
Look at these creditors. There will be more of them at his office.

849
00:40:29,048 --> 00:40:31,704
- I was just asking. - I was just making a remark.

850
00:40:33,948 --> 00:40:36,956
Or is there anyone who might know where your dad is now?

851
00:40:36,957 --> 00:40:38,099
Well...

852
00:40:39,457 --> 00:40:41,578
Right, Secretary Kim will probably know.

853
00:40:42,028 --> 00:40:43,956
Really? Then you should call him.

854
00:40:43,957 --> 00:40:46,197
I lost my phone, you know.

855
00:40:46,198 --> 00:40:47,742
I don't remember the phone number.

856
00:40:50,338 --> 00:40:52,297
It should be saved on my old phone.

857
00:40:52,298 --> 00:40:53,985
Really? Where's your old phone?

858
00:40:54,207 --> 00:40:55,436
In my dressing table drawer.

859
00:40:55,437 --> 00:40:56,447
What?

860
00:40:57,108 --> 00:40:59,704
Are you saying it's inside the house?

861
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:01,118
Yes.

862
00:41:02,577 --> 00:41:05,877
Would you guys be able to go and get it for me?

863
00:41:05,878 --> 00:41:08,514
Us? You're asking us to sneak in there now?

864
00:41:09,117 --> 00:41:11,108
Why? You don't want to do it?

865
00:41:13,158 --> 00:41:15,784
That wedding dress was very expensive.

866
00:41:16,387 --> 00:41:19,527
A famous seamstress sewed every stitch by hand...

867
00:41:19,528 --> 00:41:21,496
Okay, fine! We never said we didn't want to do it.

868
00:41:21,497 --> 00:41:23,366
We'll go bring it for you. Don't worry.

869
00:41:23,367 --> 00:41:26,226
What are you talking about? Look at the creditors. How will we sneak in?

870
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:29,877
We'll just jump over the wall.

871
00:41:29,878 --> 00:41:31,576
We don't have time for that!

872
00:41:31,577 --> 00:41:33,092
You can stay here, you coward!

873
00:41:33,278 --> 00:41:34,924
The two real men will go.

874
00:41:35,178 --> 00:41:36,916
Ki Bong, let's go.

875
00:41:36,917 --> 00:41:37,927
Okay.

876
00:41:40,117 --> 00:41:41,186
Hey.

877
00:41:41,187 --> 00:41:43,207
- Where did he go? - Who knows?

878
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:48,056
- Mr. Han! - He's inside.

879
00:41:48,057 --> 00:41:50,027
- We have no time now. - Come out!

880
00:41:50,028 --> 00:41:51,674
This is totally crazy.

881
00:41:52,028 --> 00:41:53,139
Mr. Han!

882
00:41:53,727 --> 00:41:56,353
The sky is so blue today.

883
00:42:07,148 --> 00:42:08,206
Prove your manhood.

884
00:42:08,207 --> 00:42:10,368
- What? No way. - Start climbing already.

885
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,534
Gosh, I'm scared.

889

Hurry up. Why is it taking you so long?

890
00:42:37,908 --> 00:42:39,756
- Come on. Quick. - All right, I'm coming.

891
00:42:40,878 --> 00:42:42,826
- How did he climb so fast? - What's he doing?

892
00:42:43,318 --> 00:42:44,630
Hey, I'm impressed.

893
00:42:45,417 --> 00:42:46,786
Are you Spider-Man or what?

894
00:42:46,787 --> 00:42:48,606
He's tall, but he can't do anything.

895
00:42:50,988 --> 00:42:53,056
- Jun Ki. - This isn't time to goof around.

896
00:42:53,057 --> 00:42:54,427
- I can't go higher than this. - Hurry!

897
00:42:54,428 --> 00:42:55,801
- Pull me up. - Hurry up.

898
00:42:55,988 --> 00:42:57,627
Hey, I think I'm done.

00:42:57,628 --> 00:42:58,870
Go ahead without me. Jun Ki!

900
00:42:59,298 --> 00:43:01,217
Gosh, Jun Ki!

901
00:43:01,568 --> 00:43:04,163
Are you a fish or what?

902
00:43:10,278 --> 00:43:11,854
Gosh, that was so nerve-racking.

903
00:43:12,137 --> 00:43:13,407
Do we really have to do this?

904
00:43:13,408 --> 00:43:14,476
What can we do?

905
00:43:14,477 --> 00:43:17,579
We should at least do this to thank her for the expensive wedding dress.

906
00:43:17,948 --> 00:43:19,332
Let's find the phone and get out.

907
00:43:19,448 --> 00:43:20,458
Okay.

908
00:43:22,117 --> 00:43:24,885
Oh, my. Are we in some kind of a palace or what?

909
00:43:25,057 --> 00:43:27,077
Soo Yeon's family is still loaded.

910
00:43:27,128 --> 00:43:29,386
Hey, let's hurry up and find her room first.

911
00:43:29,387 --> 00:43:30,408
Okay.

912
00:43:34,497 --> 00:43:35,608
Come on.

913
00:43:44,408 --> 00:43:45,649
- Jun Ki! - Yes?

914
00:43:45,738 --> 00:43:46,907
This must be Soo Yeon's room.

915
00:43:46,908 --> 00:43:47,918
Really?

916
00:43:54,648 --> 00:43:56,001
Yes, that's Soo Yeon.

917
00:43:56,658 --> 00:43:57,697
She's so pretty.

918
00:43:58,187 --> 00:43:59,228
Right, the dressing table.

919
00:44:01,057 --> 00:44:02,067
It's here.

920
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,585
- We found it. - Let's get out of here.

921
00:44:15,238 --> 00:44:16,436
Where is he?

922
00:44:16,437 --> 00:44:18,476
- Mr. Han! - Come out right now!

923
00:44:18,477 --> 00:44:20,124
- Where is he? - Come out!

924
00:44:20,207 --> 00:44:22,732
- Hey! - Where are you?

925
00:44:23,917 --> 00:44:24,988
Hey!

926
00:44:26,417 --> 00:44:28,033
You don't want to come out right now.

927
00:44:28,417 --> 00:44:29,629
You'll probably get killed.

928
00:44:34,387 --> 00:44:35,539
Who are they?

929
00:44:35,758 --> 00:44:36,909
Creditors?

930
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:38,338
What should we do?

931
00:44:38,727 --> 00:44:41,353
- This is crazy. - Let's look around.

932
00:44:41,468 --> 00:44:44,397
Take out anything that looks valuable.

933
00:44:44,398 --> 00:44:46,418
This painting, for example. That too.

934
00:44:46,568 --> 00:44:47,706
Take them all out.

935
00:44:47,707 --> 00:44:49,727
Take everything out of the rooms too.

936
00:44:55,207 --> 00:44:56,916
Sir, this door is locked.

937
00:44:56,917 --> 00:44:58,998
Then we'll have to smash it.

938
00:44:59,577 --> 00:45:00,900
- Smash it. - They're going to smash it.

939
00:45:04,557 --> 00:45:05,669
What should we do?

940
00:45:08,928 --> 00:45:09,999
Gosh.

941
00:45:15,528 --> 00:45:17,789
Sir, the door is open.

942
00:45:18,238 --> 00:45:20,732
See? There are a ton of things in here.

943
00:45:20,838 --> 00:45:24,574
Take out everything that looks valuable.

944
00:45:24,608 --> 00:45:26,576
The dressing table, the bed,

945
00:45:26,577 --> 00:45:27,718
and the wardrobe.

946
00:45:28,577 --> 00:45:30,435
What's in the wardrobe?

947
00:45:34,588 --> 00:45:37,317
See? They all look expensive.

948
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:38,556
They can be worth quite a bit.

949
00:45:38,557 --> 00:45:41,355
- Take out the whole wardrobe. - Okay.

950
00:45:42,727 --> 00:45:44,427
- Please take everything out. - Okay.

951
00:45:44,428 --> 00:45:46,518
Take that out too.

952
00:45:46,767 --> 00:45:51,039
We're doomed. It's moving.

953
00:45:51,667 --> 00:45:53,111
What's taking them so long?

954
00:45:54,108 --> 00:45:55,407
Hey, what's going on?

955
00:45:55,408 --> 00:45:56,993
Hurry up!

956
00:45:57,207 --> 00:45:58,390
That's my dressing table.

957
00:45:59,278 --> 00:46:01,095
- And that's my wardrobe. - Move.

958
00:46:01,548 --> 00:46:03,295
Let's move it a bit.

959
00:46:04,718 --> 00:46:05,789
It's too dark.

960
00:46:06,718 --> 00:46:08,607
Where are we?

961
00:46:14,088 --> 00:46:15,643
Slowly.

962
00:46:15,887 --> 00:46:17,757
What are they doing?

963
00:46:17,758 --> 00:46:18,869
It's Jun Ki.

964
00:46:19,398 --> 00:46:21,766
Hey, what's going on? What's taking so long?

965
00:46:21,767 --> 00:46:24,768
Woo Shik, there's a problem.

966
00:46:24,867 --> 00:46:27,067
We're locked up.

967
00:46:27,068 --> 00:46:28,766
You're locked up? Where?

968
00:46:28,767 --> 00:46:31,869
In Soo Yeon's wardrobe.

969
00:46:33,378 --> 00:46:35,326
Her wardrobe? What are you...

970
00:46:38,178 --> 00:46:39,490
Is the wardrobe pink?

971
00:46:39,977 --> 00:46:40,987
How do you know that?

972
00:46:40,988 --> 00:46:43,815
You guys are being loaded onto a truck right now.

973
00:46:44,658 --> 00:46:46,587
It's moving!

974
00:46:46,588 --> 00:46:48,956
- Jun Ki! - Be quiet!

975
00:46:48,957 --> 00:46:50,087
Save us!

976
00:46:50,088 --> 00:46:53,663
Save us! We might get killed!

977
00:46:54,298 --> 00:46:56,045
You idiots.

978
00:46:57,167 --> 00:46:59,621
- What's wrong? What happened? - I don't know.

979
00:47:00,068 --> 00:47:01,885
This is driving me crazy.

980
00:47:06,878 --> 00:47:09,447
Is it so hard to pay me an advance?

981
00:47:09,448 --> 00:47:10,559
They're so mean.

982
00:47:11,718 --> 00:47:12,890
Where's everybody?

983
00:47:14,648 --> 00:47:17,142
Why did that girl just leave her dress there?

984
00:47:25,557 --> 00:47:27,921
This is beautiful.

985
00:47:29,727 --> 00:47:31,758
I think it looks pretty good on me.

986
00:47:33,867 --> 00:47:35,625
I want to get married too.

987
00:47:39,077 --> 00:47:42,482
Will I stay single all my life?

988
00:47:43,378 --> 00:47:45,116
Whatever. I should take this off.

989
00:47:45,117 --> 00:47:46,935
It'd be so embarrassing if they caught me in this.

990
00:47:49,648 --> 00:47:50,729
My hair.

991
00:47:51,057 --> 00:47:53,410
Gosh, I can't believe this.

992
00:47:57,398 --> 00:47:59,953
What is it? It's completely stuck.

993
00:48:00,468 --> 00:48:01,780
What should I do?

994
00:48:01,898 --> 00:48:03,936
What the heck, I'll just cut it off.

995
00:48:03,937 --> 00:48:05,988
Where are scissors?

996
00:48:06,767 --> 00:48:09,364
Scissors.

997
00:48:12,477 --> 00:48:15,205
Darn it. This is ridiculous.

998
00:48:16,278 --> 00:48:18,217
Anyway, I need to find scissors.

999
00:48:18,218 --> 00:48:20,066
Scissors.

1000
00:48:22,948 --> 00:48:25,382
What is it now?

1001
00:48:30,028 --> 00:48:31,644
Why can't I pull out my leg?

1002
00:48:32,298 --> 00:48:34,823
Hello? Is anyone here?

1003
00:48:35,028 --> 00:48:37,765
Hello? Anyone?

1004
00:48:40,867 --> 00:48:43,262
What should we do now? This is just crazy.

1005
00:48:44,207 --> 00:48:45,837
Let's have a smoke first.

1006
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:46,959
- Okay. - Okay.

1007
00:48:47,678 --> 00:48:49,364
They're leaving. This is it.

1008
00:48:58,787 --> 00:49:00,575
Jun Ki, Ki Bong, are you okay?

1009
00:49:01,287 --> 00:49:04,226
- Woo Shik, get us out of here. - Woo Shik.

1010
00:49:04,227 --> 00:49:05,369
Give me a second.

1011
00:49:11,338 --> 00:49:12,479
Guys!

1012
00:49:14,367 --> 00:49:15,549
- Woo Shik. - Cut it out.

1013
00:49:15,667 --> 00:49:17,636
- We don't have time. Come out. - We're here.

1014
00:49:17,637 --> 00:49:19,022
- We're coming up. - Darn it.

1015
00:49:22,548 --> 00:49:24,699
Gosh, he's so impatient.

1016
00:49:25,617 --> 00:49:27,608
- What's going on? - Why did the straps come off?

1017
00:49:27,917 --> 00:49:29,147
It could have been bad.

1018
00:49:29,148 --> 00:49:31,683
- Let's move the wardrobe first. - Okay.

1019
00:49:32,858 --> 00:49:34,027
Help! Hurry!

1020
00:49:34,028 --> 00:49:36,179
- All right. - Be careful.

1021
00:49:36,287 --> 00:49:38,379
Oh, no. This is not good.

1022
00:49:41,898 --> 00:49:43,313
Bye.

1023
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:44,882
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

1024
00:49:44,969 --> 00:49:46,585
I dozed off.

1025
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:48,783
- Honey, you're home. - Yes.

1026
00:49:49,739 --> 00:49:52,000
Oh, my. What's all this?

1027
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:55,642
I went to Mr. Han's house and took everything valuable.

1028
00:49:55,748 --> 00:49:56,860
Good.

1029
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:01,803
This wardrobe is so pretty.

1030
00:50:02,349 --> 00:50:04,642
It's all pink. It's my style.

1031
00:50:14,728 --> 00:50:18,537
Honey, what are these in the wardrobe?

1032
00:50:18,538 --> 00:50:21,336
What do you think? They're all for you.

1033
00:50:21,938 --> 00:50:23,049
All these?

1034
00:50:23,909 --> 00:50:25,178
Yes.

1035
00:50:25,179 --> 00:50:27,408
Pick out the ones you like...

1036
00:50:27,409 --> 00:50:30,651
- I like this one. - Are you crazy?

1037
00:50:31,248 --> 00:50:32,330
Gosh.

1038
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,318
Who are you guys? What are you doing here?

1039
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:37,457
Well, the thing is...

1040
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:40,287
Who are you? How did you end up here?

1041
00:50:40,659 --> 00:50:43,416
Well, let me explain.

1042
00:50:48,969 --> 00:50:51,568
Dr. Cha, it's a success.

1043
00:50:51,569 --> 00:50:53,619
Dr. Kook, we finally made it.

1044
00:50:53,739 --> 00:50:54,819
A "success"?

1045
00:50:55,239 --> 00:50:57,158
- What do you mean? - Let us introduce ourselves.

1046
00:50:59,038 --> 00:51:00,119
Hello.

1047
00:51:00,779 --> 00:51:01,860
Nice to meet you.

1048
00:51:03,878 --> 00:51:08,091
NASA is studying teleportation in secret,

1049
00:51:08,518 --> 00:51:09,700
and we're the researchers.

1050
00:51:10,889 --> 00:51:12,505
- Teleportation? - Yes.

1051
00:51:12,659 --> 00:51:15,287
After a long experiment, we've finally succeeded...

1052
00:51:15,288 --> 00:51:17,528
in teleporting ourselves here.

1053
00:51:17,529 --> 00:51:18,943
You teleported yourselves?

1054
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:21,298
Into this wardrobe?

1055
00:51:21,299 --> 00:51:22,641
I knew you wouldn't believe it.

1056
00:51:22,828 --> 00:51:25,728
Then we'll have to show you.

1057
00:51:31,409 --> 00:51:33,661
This is the teleportation device.

1058
00:51:34,949 --> 00:51:38,858
On the count of three, we'll teleport to another wardrobe.

1059
00:51:39,279 --> 00:51:41,848
Well, close your eyes.

1060
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:44,957
- Why? - The extremely strong light...

1061
00:51:44,958 --> 00:51:47,311
from this device can destroy your optic nerves.

1062
00:51:47,489 --> 00:51:50,418
If you don't mind going blind, keep your eyes open.

1063
00:51:50,828 --> 00:51:52,242
- That's not a good idea. - Excuse me.

1064
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,840
Well... I'll start the device.

1065
00:52:01,268 --> 00:52:03,592
- Honey. - I'm going to count to three.

1066
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:06,890
One.

1067
00:52:07,279 --> 00:52:10,380
Honey, I think we should close our eyes.

1068
00:52:10,578 --> 00:52:11,659
Two.

1069
00:52:12,978 --> 00:52:15,311
- We're from NASA. - NASA!

1070
00:52:16,089 --> 00:52:17,472
- Three! - Oh, my.

1071
00:52:23,288 --> 00:52:24,440
What happened?

1072
00:52:24,659 --> 00:52:26,143
Are they gone?

1073
00:52:26,529 --> 00:52:27,740
Well...

1074
00:52:30,429 --> 00:52:33,973
You punks. I knew it.

1075
00:52:34,608 --> 00:52:37,138
You work for Mr. Han, don't you?

1076
00:52:37,139 --> 00:52:39,330
Soo Yeon, start the car!

1077
00:52:39,409 --> 00:52:41,499
- Right now! - Okay.

1078
00:52:41,708 --> 00:52:44,172
You punks, stop right there!

1079
00:52:44,378 --> 00:52:46,298
You guys are dead meat.

1080
00:52:48,949 --> 00:52:50,200
I thought we were going to die.

1081
00:52:51,489 --> 00:52:53,758
I was scared to death.

1082
00:52:53,759 --> 00:52:56,227
I told you not to go in there. Look what happened to you.

1083
00:52:56,228 --> 00:52:58,076
- It was going well until... - Cut it out!

1084
00:52:59,328 --> 00:53:02,834
Anyway, it's all Soo Yeon's fault.

1085
00:53:03,369 --> 00:53:05,055
She's our first love.

1086
00:53:05,998 --> 00:53:07,655
Hello, Secretary Kim.

1087
00:53:08,069 --> 00:53:10,468
Do you know where my dad is right now?

1088
00:53:10,469 --> 00:53:12,024
He's with me.

1089
00:53:15,049 --> 00:53:16,607
- Soo Yeon. - Dad.

1090
00:53:16,608 --> 00:53:18,063
Soo Yeon, where are you?

1091
00:53:18,248 --> 00:53:19,247
Are you all right?

1092
00:53:19,248 --> 00:53:21,388
Yes, I'm all right. What about you?

1093
00:53:21,389 --> 00:53:22,500
I'm okay.

1094
00:53:23,619 --> 00:53:26,042
I'm sorry, Soo Yeon. This is all my fault.

1095
00:53:26,958 --> 00:53:30,258
It's okay. But what is this all about?

1096
00:53:30,259 --> 00:53:33,389
I'm afraid I've been conned.

1097
00:53:33,858 --> 00:53:36,292
Anyway, I'll take care of it soon and call you.

1098
00:53:36,699 --> 00:53:38,638
Hang in there, okay?

1099
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:40,098
What do you mean?

1100
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:41,956
I can't talk for long.

1101
00:53:42,069 --> 00:53:43,207
I'll call you again.

1102
00:53:43,208 --> 00:53:45,460
Dad. Dad.

1103
00:53:51,018 --> 00:53:52,998
Soo Yeon. What's wrong?

1104
00:53:53,418 --> 00:53:54,964
What did your father say?

1105
00:54:04,759 --> 00:54:06,617
I think it's here.

1106
00:54:07,268 --> 00:54:09,552
Is this where you and your fiance will live in?

1107
00:54:09,668 --> 00:54:10,667
Yes.

1108
00:54:10,668 --> 00:54:12,767
I don't think the creditors came here.

1109
00:54:12,768 --> 00:54:14,021
I guess you're right.

1110
00:54:14,469 --> 00:54:17,095
But didn't you say you can't reach your fiance?

1111
00:54:17,639 --> 00:54:18,689
What do you plan to do?

1112
00:54:19,438 --> 00:54:21,429
I'll wait until he comes.

1113
00:54:23,208 --> 00:54:25,845
Anyway, thank you for everything.

1114
00:54:26,449 --> 00:54:28,469
I promise to repay you guys one day.

1115
00:54:28,889 --> 00:54:30,333
Come on, there's no need.

1116
00:54:31,219 --> 00:54:33,279
Take care, Soo Yeon.

1117
00:54:33,918 --> 00:54:35,827
Call us if anything goes wrong.

1118
00:54:35,828 --> 00:54:36,900
- Right. - Thanks.

1119
00:54:37,159 --> 00:54:38,528
Drive carefully, guys.

1120
00:54:38,529 --> 00:54:39,812
- Okay. - Bye.

1121
00:54:47,038 --> 00:54:48,220
Will she be okay?

1122
00:54:48,308 --> 00:54:50,055
It's not time for us to worry about someone else.

1123
00:54:50,569 --> 00:54:51,707
Let's go get money.

1124
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:52,890
Okay, let's go.

1125
00:54:53,808 --> 00:54:54,920
Wait a minute.

1126
00:54:56,549 --> 00:54:58,296
- This place has some good steak. - It's here.

1127
00:55:00,148 --> 00:55:02,139
- Soo Yeon. - Min Seok.

1128
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:05,357
Hey, isn't he the groom from the wedding?

1129
00:55:05,358 --> 00:55:06,733
Yes, he is.

1130
00:55:07,688 --> 00:55:10,113
What on earth happened? I couldn't get a hold of you.

1131
00:55:10,728 --> 00:55:12,446
Well, the thing is...

1132
00:55:16,929 --> 00:55:19,368
I'm sorry. I know you were worried, Mother.

1133
00:55:19,369 --> 00:55:21,560
Who are you calling your mother?

1134
00:55:23,308 --> 00:55:24,908
- Sorry? - Do you know how much...

1135
00:55:24,909 --> 00:55:27,202
our family was humiliated because of you?

1136
00:55:28,179 --> 00:55:29,607
What is going on over there?

1137
00:55:29,608 --> 00:55:31,032
What is that situation?

1138
00:55:32,018 --> 00:55:34,847
Anyway, I'll keep it short.

1139
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:38,188
Let's cancel this marriage.

1140
00:55:39,619 --> 00:55:42,587
What... What are you talking about?

1141
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:45,558
Are you slow-witted or plain stupid?

1142
00:55:45,828 --> 00:55:48,968
Do you think I approved of this marriage because we liked you?

1143
00:55:48,969 --> 00:55:51,494
It was all because of your dad's wealth.

1144
00:55:54,308 --> 00:55:58,207
So, know your place, and never come back here again.

1145
00:55:58,208 --> 00:55:59,421
And don't call us either.

1146
00:56:00,009 --> 00:56:02,029
How could you be so shameless?

1147
00:56:07,449 --> 00:56:09,368
Hey, that lady is too harsh.

1148
00:56:13,759 --> 00:56:14,769
Min Seok.

1149
00:56:20,029 --> 00:56:21,039
I'm sorry.

1150
00:56:21,869 --> 00:56:23,141
There's nothing I can do.

1151
00:56:43,619 --> 00:56:46,417
That piece of trash. How could he do that?

1152
00:56:46,418 --> 00:56:48,579
I know, I'm going to go kill those...

1153
00:56:48,589 --> 00:56:49,658
Hey, let's just go.

1154
00:56:49,659 --> 00:56:51,928
- Hey, Woo Shik. - Let's go home.

1155
00:56:51,929 --> 00:56:53,777
Not there, let's go home!

1156
00:56:58,268 --> 00:56:59,278
Get up.

1157
00:57:01,538 --> 00:57:03,357
Get up already. Let's go.

1158
00:57:03,639 --> 00:57:04,820
Go where?

1159
00:57:06,108 --> 00:57:07,747
I don't have any place to go.

1160
00:57:07,748 --> 00:57:10,637
Why? Are you going to get on your knees and beg to them?

1161
00:57:11,578 --> 00:57:13,247
Doesn't hearing something like that make you angry?

1162
00:57:13,248 --> 00:57:14,400
I am angry.

1163
00:57:15,319 --> 00:57:17,166
I do feel angry and upset.

1164
00:57:19,259 --> 00:57:20,470
But what could I do?

1165
00:57:23,858 --> 00:57:26,283
What could I do in my situation?

1166
00:57:27,828 --> 00:57:29,343
Nothing will change from this.

1167
00:57:30,199 --> 00:57:31,310
Come with me.

1168
00:57:32,369 --> 00:57:33,681
I'm not going.

1169
00:57:36,069 --> 00:57:37,523
I said, I'm not going.

1170
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:39,959
My stuff is inside that house.

1171
00:57:47,951 --> 00:57:48,990
Who is it?

1172
00:57:55,121 --> 00:57:56,261
You startled me. Who...

1173
00:58:00,821 --> 00:58:02,850
We came for Soo Yeon's stuff.

1174
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:04,240
Stuff?

1175
00:58:04,931 --> 00:58:07,284
Soo Yeon, who are these people?

1176
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,693
That's none of your business.

1177
00:58:11,201 --> 00:58:12,484
Get out of the way.

1178
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:14,910
Who do you think you are to do this?

1179
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:17,497
Us? We're Soo Yeon's first loves.

1180
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,627
- Why? - First love?

1181
00:58:20,141 --> 00:58:23,010
Are they your first loves? All three of them?

1182
00:58:23,011 --> 00:58:24,222
No.

1183
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,921
Soo Yeon is our first love.

1184
00:58:30,451 --> 00:58:31,789
I'm first love number one.

1185
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:32,831
I'm number two.

1186
00:58:36,031 --> 00:58:37,202
I'm number three.

1187
00:58:37,801 --> 00:58:38,811
Satisfied?

1188
00:58:39,031 --> 00:58:40,990
What are you doing? Let's go get her stuff.

1189
00:58:41,330 --> 00:58:42,482
Let's go.

1190
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:44,100
This is trespassing...

1191
00:58:44,101 --> 00:58:45,800
- Move! - Hey.

1192
00:58:45,801 --> 00:58:46,811
Soo Yeon.

1193
00:58:47,341 --> 00:58:49,330
Hey! Misters, wait!

1194
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:07,490
What do you think you guys are doing?

1195
00:59:07,491 --> 00:59:10,030
Can't you see? We're taking Soo Yeon's stuff.

1196
00:59:10,031 --> 00:59:12,252
- What did you say? - You wanted to cancel the marriage.

1197
00:59:12,801 --> 00:59:14,589
So you must set things straight.

1198
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:17,492
How could you be so shameless?

1199
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:18,711
What?

1200
00:59:19,071 --> 00:59:21,269
I can't tolerate this anymore...

1201
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:23,290
What are you going to do about it?

1202
00:59:24,071 --> 00:59:25,090
What?

1203
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:27,899
Soo Yeon, did we get all your stuff?

1204
00:59:27,951 --> 00:59:29,263
- Did we leave anything out? - What?

1205
00:59:30,951 --> 00:59:33,079
There's one more thing.

1206
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,090
What is it?

1207
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:41,649
What? That suit?

1208
00:59:44,261 --> 00:59:46,017
Did you buy that suit for him too?

1209
00:59:48,471 --> 00:59:49,899
What? What do you want?

1210
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:52,240
Are you slow-witted or plain stupid?

1211
00:59:52,241 --> 00:59:53,917
Take off your suit.

1212
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,609
- What? - Goodness me.

1213
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:57,559
Do you have a hearing problem or what?

1214
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:01,004
Take off that suit when we're being nice.

1215
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:03,791
Now.

1216
01:00:06,281 --> 01:00:07,362
Goodness.

1217
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:15,930
Here.

1218
01:00:15,931 --> 01:00:18,284
He really does seem stupid.

1219
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:19,760
How are suits made?

1220
01:00:19,761 --> 01:00:21,329
- In a set. - In a set.

1221
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:22,470
What do you...

1222
01:00:22,471 --> 01:00:24,390
Take off your pants too.

1223
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,653
- Now! - Now!

1224
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:34,167
Soo Yeon, are you really going to treat me this way?

1225
01:00:35,551 --> 01:00:36,590
I'm sorry.

1226
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:38,966
There's nothing I can do.

1227
01:00:44,761 --> 01:00:46,842
- Take it off! - Take it off!

1228
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:53,191
Soo Yeon, we didn't leave anything behind, right?

1229
01:00:53,701 --> 01:00:54,740
No.

1230
01:00:55,801 --> 01:00:57,447
Oh, right. Minky.

1231
01:00:57,971 --> 01:00:59,314
I almost forgot Minky.

1232
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,955
- Minky? - Is there more?

1233
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,959
- Minky? - What is that?

1234
01:01:06,511 --> 01:01:09,149
Minky was your iguana?

1235
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:12,513
Yes. I've raised him since I was a kid and he's like family.

1236
01:01:13,821 --> 01:01:14,831
I see.

1237
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,166
Soo Yeon, what's your plan?

1238
01:01:17,451 --> 01:01:19,541
Should I drop you off at a relative's house?

1239
01:01:19,621 --> 01:01:20,701
Relative?

1240
01:01:22,431 --> 01:01:24,753
It's been long since we split up because of money.

1241
01:01:25,161 --> 01:01:27,100
Then do you have a place to go?

1242
01:01:27,101 --> 01:01:29,050
I'll have to start searching now.

1243
01:01:29,431 --> 01:01:30,441
Really?

1244
01:01:31,101 --> 01:01:32,554
You have to start searching?

1245
01:01:33,801 --> 01:01:37,244
You can just stay at our guesthouse.

1246
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,609
Right, Woo Shik?

1247
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:40,680
Right. We have a lot of vacant rooms,

1248
01:01:40,681 --> 01:01:41,923
and no guests anyway.

1249
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:45,720
Can I really stay there?

1250
01:01:45,721 --> 01:01:46,731
Sure.

1251
01:01:47,721 --> 01:01:49,640
Is that okay, Woo Shik?

1252
01:01:50,221 --> 01:01:52,746
Well, if she wants to.

1253
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:53,831
Really?

1254
01:01:54,391 --> 01:01:56,248
Thank you, guys.

1255
01:01:56,661 --> 01:01:58,600
I'll repay you for this one day.

1256
01:01:58,601 --> 01:02:00,200
Don't get too excited.

1257
01:02:00,201 --> 01:02:01,800
We don't know when we'll be kicked out either.

1258
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:04,022
Come on, it's all right.

1259
01:02:04,101 --> 01:02:05,999
We have Soo Yeon's wedding dress.

1260
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,169
We can sell that and pay the landlady 5,000 dollars first.

1261
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:09,826
Then she'll cut us some slack.

1262
01:02:17,781 --> 01:02:19,134
- Hey, Jun Ki. - Yes.

1263
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:22,761
Soo Yeon, be careful.

1264
01:02:24,051 --> 01:02:25,101
Oh, boy.

1265
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:26,735
- Hey, watch your hand. - Okay.

1266
01:02:26,821 --> 01:02:27,902
Be careful.

1267
01:02:29,161 --> 01:02:30,877
Thank you so much, guys.

1268
01:02:30,931 --> 01:02:32,980
I'll make sure I repay you guys for...

1269
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,854
- What? What is it? What happened? - There's...

1270
01:02:43,911 --> 01:02:45,022
It's Jung Eun.

1271
01:02:45,341 --> 01:02:48,279
Jung Eun, what are you doing here? Why are you sleeping like this?

1272
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:50,721
Hey, Kim Jung Eun!

1273
01:02:53,051 --> 01:02:54,789
My gosh, Jun Ki.

1274
01:02:54,790 --> 01:02:56,336
What are you doing here?

1275
01:02:57,591 --> 01:03:00,216
Isn't that Soo Yeon's wedding dress?

1276
01:03:01,491 --> 01:03:04,359
Well, it was in the living room,

1277
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:05,660
so I just wanted to try it on.

1278
01:03:05,661 --> 01:03:07,200
It's not yours! Why would you try it on?

1279
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:08,383
Do you know how expensive...

1280
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:12,463
Hang on. Why is the dress hooked onto that thing?

1281
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:24,114
Hey, this... Why is the dress ripped?

1282
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:25,661
What happened?

1283
01:03:26,281 --> 01:03:27,780
How did this happen?

1284
01:03:27,781 --> 01:03:30,689
When I was trying to take it off, my hair...

1285
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:33,320
- My hair got caught. - You should've been careful!

1286
01:03:33,321 --> 01:03:34,532
You idiot!

1287
01:03:35,091 --> 01:03:38,232
We're doomed now. You ruined our plan!

1288
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:39,913
My 5,000 dollars...

1289
01:03:40,201 --> 01:03:41,888
My 5,000 dollars is gone down the drain!

1290
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,011
Mr. Cha!

1291
01:03:45,601 --> 01:03:47,669
Hey, Ms. Kim is already here.

1292
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:48,740
What do we do now?

1293
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:50,761
Let's go downstairs. Come on.

1294
01:03:50,871 --> 01:03:52,597
Hey, where are you going? Darn it.

1295
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:55,235
Guys, help me pull out my leg. Hey!

1296
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,726
Where did everyone go?

1297
01:03:58,181 --> 01:04:00,442
My gosh! What is that?

1298
01:04:00,721 --> 01:04:01,862
Ms. Kim!

1299
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:05,235
Hello, Ms. Kim.

1300
01:04:05,290 --> 01:04:07,281
Woo Shik. No, I mean...

1301
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:09,301
Mr. Cha.

1302
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:11,800
I hope you have the money ready.

1303
01:04:11,801 --> 01:04:14,022
Pardon? Oh, actually...

1304
01:04:14,161 --> 01:04:16,120
I knew it. You obviously couldn't get the money.

1305
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:17,953
Then I have no choice.

1306
01:04:18,601 --> 01:04:20,318
- Get started. - Yes, ma'am.

1307
01:04:20,601 --> 01:04:22,490
What... Get started with what? What's going on?

1308
01:04:24,571 --> 01:04:27,004
Ms. Kim, forgive us just this once. Please?

1309
01:04:27,411 --> 01:04:31,149
Ms. Kim, please give us one more week.

1310
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:33,474
Ms. Kim, I'm begging you.

1311
01:04:33,551 --> 01:04:35,519
- Please help us just this once. - Let go!

1312
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,187
- We can't. - I can't help you anymore. Let go!

1313
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:42,716
Gosh, how ruthless.

1314
01:04:42,991 --> 01:04:45,990
Look. They just have to give you the money by today, right?

1315
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,011
Yes, why do you ask?

1316
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,930
Guys, what's the exact total of your overdue rent?

1317
01:04:50,931 --> 01:04:53,729
Well, including everything,

1318
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,192
- I think it's about 10,000 dollars. - Is that so?

1319
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:03,339
Guys, get Minky.

1320
01:05:04,681 --> 01:05:05,761
Here you go.

1321
01:05:06,551 --> 01:05:07,692
Thank you.

1322
01:05:08,851 --> 01:05:10,740
An iguana costs 10,000 dollars?

1323
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:13,286
Minky is a rare one.

1324
01:05:13,491 --> 01:05:15,813
- It's a rare species. - I see.

1325
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:17,404
Are you really going to be okay?

1326
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,674
We have no choice.

1327
01:05:21,301 --> 01:05:25,815
Minky, I promise I'll come and get you.

1328
01:05:26,571 --> 01:05:28,258
Make sure you always eat well.

1329
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:37,200
Now that we've paid our overdue rent,

1330
01:05:37,281 --> 01:05:39,574
this world looks like such a beautiful place.

1331
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:41,464
- Right? - Yes.

1332
01:05:42,051 --> 01:05:44,616
I thought we were really going to get kicked out this time.

1333
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:47,445
- Right, Woo Shik? - What? Yes.

1334
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,179
Anyway, you saved us.

1335
01:05:51,161 --> 01:05:53,282
- Thanks. - Don't mention it.

1336
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,519
I told you that I'd be sure to repay you guys.

1337
01:05:59,871 --> 01:06:02,598
Those kids remind me of the old days. Right?

1338
01:06:03,511 --> 01:06:06,974
Yes, totally. We used to hang out like that all the time.

1339
01:06:07,281 --> 01:06:08,379
Soo Yeon, do you remember?

1340
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:10,977
Of course. Those were the good days.

1341
01:06:13,781 --> 01:06:16,590
Oh, right. There's something...

1342
01:06:16,591 --> 01:06:18,409
I've been curious about.

1343
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:19,572
What is it?

1344
01:06:21,191 --> 01:06:23,756
Am I really your first love?

1345
01:06:23,861 --> 01:06:25,042
All three of you?

1346
01:06:26,731 --> 01:06:29,558
- Gosh, it's chilly. - We should get going.

1347
01:06:29,801 --> 01:06:31,640
I feel tired after I paid the money.

1348
01:06:31,641 --> 01:06:33,800
- I'm exhausted. - What? Why change the topic?

1349
01:06:33,801 --> 01:06:36,369
- What's wrong with me? - Am I really your first love?

1350
01:06:36,370 --> 01:06:38,279
- Tell me. Answer me. - Gosh!

1351
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,579
Goodness, it's freezing.

1352
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:41,095
- Let's run. - Oh, shall we?

1353
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,524
- Okay. - Why are you running?

1354
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:44,064
- Run! - Let's go!

1355
01:06:45,981 --> 01:06:48,243
Hey, where are you going? Hey!

1356
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:49,533
Get back here!

1357
01:06:49,851 --> 01:06:51,001
Hey, wait up!

1358
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:54,347
- This is mine! - Why do you take it all?

1359
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:56,242
Look at him.

1360
01:06:56,731 --> 01:06:57,771
Give it back.

1361
01:06:58,500 --> 01:06:59,915
Stop it!

1362
01:07:00,101 --> 01:07:01,171
Stop!

1363
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:15,204
(Welcome to Waikiki 2)

1364
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:17,480
Why is the business so slow?

1365
01:07:17,481 --> 01:07:20,180
A TV appearance is the best thing for publicity.

1366
01:07:20,181 --> 01:07:22,190
Ki Bong, a TV show producer is here to meet you.

1367
01:07:22,191 --> 01:07:24,860
I heard you never feel cold. Is it true?

1368
01:07:24,861 --> 01:07:26,103
You want me to go in there?

1369
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:28,529
Why is this here?

1370
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:30,029
It shouldn't be there, right?

1371
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:31,829
Get out this instant. Get out!

1372
01:07:31,830 --> 01:07:33,999
How do I look? Don't I look like a successful career woman?

1373
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,129
I'm going to get a job.

1374
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:36,282
Inside the bear?

1375
01:07:37,771 --> 01:07:39,340
Why must you always get yourself in trouble?

1376
01:07:39,341 --> 01:07:40,940
How could you say that? I'm not well!

1377
01:07:40,941 --> 01:07:42,569
You'll work at a promotional event?

1378
01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:44,510
I can't get Jung Eun fired.

1379
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:46,409
Soo Yeon may get fired if I don't do well.

1380
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:48,510
- Two freebies! - I'm going to buy that.

1381
01:07:48,511 --> 01:07:49,980
Four more!

1382
01:07:49,981 --> 01:07:51,279
Hey, you two over there!

1383
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,705
The angel and flower are fighting.

1384
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,032
What now?

1385
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:57,271
Thanks for all your help today.
