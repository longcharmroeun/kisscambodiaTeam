1
00:00:13,076 --> 00:00:15,413
There's never an end to these darn stickers.

2
00:00:16,955 --> 00:00:18,674
Now that all the seizure stickers...

3
00:00:18,675 --> 00:00:20,214
and the hole in the ceiling are gone,

4
00:00:20,215 --> 00:00:22,173
I feel so happy now.

5
00:00:22,565 --> 00:00:25,036
I know. I thought we were really getting kicked out this time.

6
00:00:25,106 --> 00:00:27,064
This is all thanks to Soo Yeon.

7
00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:30,276
But doesn't living in the same house with our first love...

8
00:00:30,277 --> 00:00:32,076
feel so strange?

9
00:00:32,077 --> 00:00:33,663
I couldn't even get any sleep.

10
00:00:35,586 --> 00:00:38,676
Woo Shik, you feel really excited too, don't you?

11
00:00:38,757 --> 00:00:41,125
Not at all. I feel nothing.

12
00:00:41,257 --> 00:00:42,318
What?

13
00:00:43,757 --> 00:00:45,507
As if.

14
00:00:45,626 --> 00:00:47,055
Who was the one who jumped out of Rebecca when...

15
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:49,226
Soo Yeon was mistreated by her mother-in-law?

16
00:00:49,227 --> 00:00:52,966
And you were the one who suggested going back for Soo Yeon's stuff.

17
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:54,506
Really? Woo Shik said that?

18
00:00:54,507 --> 00:00:55,804
Yes, I'm telling you.

19
00:00:55,967 --> 00:00:58,407
Why? Did you feel pity for Soo Yeon?

20
00:00:58,537 --> 00:01:02,246
Or were you reminded of the old days after meeting your first love?

21
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:03,405
It's not that.

22
00:01:03,406 --> 00:01:05,126
- Stop being ridiculous. - Guys.

23
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:07,986
How do I look?

24
00:01:07,987 --> 00:01:10,215
Don't I look like a successful career woman?

25
00:01:10,216 --> 00:01:13,055
What? Well, I guess so.

26
00:01:13,056 --> 00:01:14,910
Why are you all dressed up?

27
00:01:14,957 --> 00:01:16,327
I'm going to get a job.

28
00:01:16,686 --> 00:01:18,226
I'll take our family's house back,

29
00:01:18,227 --> 00:01:20,656
pay back all my dad's debt, and bring him back.

30
00:01:20,657 --> 00:01:22,096
That sounds amazing.

31
00:01:22,097 --> 00:01:25,366
I thought you'd be crying and whining for the time being.

32
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:26,428
Right, Woo Shik?

33
00:01:28,936 --> 00:01:31,506
I admire your determination,

34
00:01:31,507 --> 00:01:34,421
but it's really difficult to find a job these days.

35
00:01:34,946 --> 00:01:37,655
Hey, do you want to bet on it?

36
00:01:38,046 --> 00:01:41,240
Whether I find a job within a week. How about 10 flicks to the forehead?

37
00:01:41,817 --> 00:01:42,878
Deal.

38
00:01:50,326 --> 00:01:51,855
How could you really hit me?

39
00:01:51,856 --> 00:01:53,295
A bet is a bet.

40
00:01:53,296 --> 00:01:56,046
I told you finding a job is no easy task.

41
00:01:56,326 --> 00:01:58,236
Soo Yeon, don't be so worried.

42
00:01:58,237 --> 00:01:59,596
You can find a part-time job.

43
00:01:59,597 --> 00:02:01,872
She was fired from all of her part-time jobs.

44
00:02:01,936 --> 00:02:03,665
What on earth did you do?

45
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,633
That's because it was my first time working.

46
00:02:05,776 --> 00:02:07,305
It was so tough and boring.

47
00:02:07,306 --> 00:02:10,075
So stop looking for any kind of job blindly,

48
00:02:10,076 --> 00:02:12,002
and look for a job that suits you.

49
00:02:12,347 --> 00:02:15,611
Don't you have something you wanted to do or a dream?

50
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:19,615
My dream once was to become a news anchor.

51
00:02:19,616 --> 00:02:21,749
You know, it looks cool to appear on the news.

52
00:02:22,057 --> 00:02:23,955
Right, should I become a news anchor then?

53
00:02:23,956 --> 00:02:25,913
As if. You can't even find a part-time job now.

54
00:02:26,557 --> 00:02:28,496
Is there something you're good at?

55
00:02:28,497 --> 00:02:29,599
Something I'm good at?

56
00:02:31,497 --> 00:02:32,836
I'm good at dancing.

57
00:02:32,837 --> 00:02:34,969
I was chosen as the dancing queen at a club once.

58
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:36,936
Forget it.

59
00:02:36,937 --> 00:02:39,876
Jung Eun, do you know any part-time jobs she can take?

60
00:02:39,877 --> 00:02:44,305
There's one job that's just perfect for Soo Yeon.

61
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,569
Really? What is it?

62
00:02:48,486 --> 00:02:51,355
Are you telling me to do this right now?

63
00:02:51,356 --> 00:02:54,925
Why? You can present new products like a news anchor,

64
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:56,656
and even show off your dancing skills.

65
00:02:56,657 --> 00:02:59,025
So promotion girl is perfect for you.

66
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:02,165
- Still, this is too... - You're not desperate enough yet.

67
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,155
- Forget it then. - No.

68
00:03:04,296 --> 00:03:06,395
I'll do it. I will.

69
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:09,147
I'll be going now, so work hard.

70
00:03:12,706 --> 00:03:13,943
Take this.

71
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,008
Shall we begin?

72
00:03:19,217 --> 00:03:22,885
Hello. I'd like to introduce a new cosmetic from Bear Skin.

73
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:25,216
This is the perfect product for hydration, whitening,

74
00:03:25,217 --> 00:03:26,834
and reducing wrinkles!

75
00:03:27,157 --> 00:03:28,156
Welcome!

76
00:03:28,157 --> 00:03:30,835
She wants me to do that?

77
00:03:31,597 --> 00:03:33,378
Goodness, this is embarrassing.

78
00:03:35,497 --> 00:03:37,731
(Fantastic Beasts)

79
00:03:40,366 --> 00:03:42,673
Let's see if we have any reserved guests.

80
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:44,986
We don't have any.

81
00:03:45,106 --> 00:03:46,549
How many months has it been?

82
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:48,037
I know.

83
00:03:48,606 --> 00:03:51,145
Why is our business so slow?

84
00:03:51,146 --> 00:03:53,415
What on earth is the reason?

85
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,343
I think the problem is the lack of promotion.

86
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,786
Other guest houses throw events and stuff.

87
00:03:58,087 --> 00:03:59,216
- Events? - Yes.

88
00:03:59,217 --> 00:04:01,143
We can hold an event too then.

89
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,866
How about an autograph event held by a famous actor?

90
00:04:04,057 --> 00:04:05,226
- A famous actor? - Yes.

91
00:04:05,227 --> 00:04:07,935
- Who? - Who do you think? Me.

92
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:11,096
I was number one on the search engines because of my funny acting.

93
00:04:11,097 --> 00:04:13,300
On top of that, I have a really cool autograph.

94
00:04:13,597 --> 00:04:14,636
Do you want to see?

95
00:04:16,937 --> 00:04:18,173
Let's see.

96
00:04:20,707 --> 00:04:26,946
Lee

97
00:04:26,947 --> 00:04:30,315
Jun

98
00:04:30,316 --> 00:04:32,115
Ki

99
00:04:32,116 --> 00:04:34,925
Forget it. Will you be able to even sign five autographs at that rate?

100
00:04:34,926 --> 00:04:37,533
What kind of madman will come here to get your autograph?

101
00:04:37,957 --> 00:04:39,027
Forget it then.

102
00:04:39,296 --> 00:04:43,696
You know, a TV appearance is the best thing for publicity.

103
00:04:43,697 --> 00:04:44,901
I'm home.

104
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:46,435
Hey.

105
00:04:46,436 --> 00:04:48,365
Did you introduce the new part-time job to Soo Yeon?

106
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:52,456
I did, but I'm not sure if she'll be able to pull it off.

107
00:04:53,606 --> 00:04:56,563
I'm worried she might cause another trouble.

108
00:04:59,116 --> 00:05:01,342
Woo Shik, are you worried about her?

109
00:05:01,517 --> 00:05:04,446
Are you anxious your first love might suffer and have a hard time?

110
00:05:04,447 --> 00:05:05,857
Is it driving you crazy?

111
00:05:06,116 --> 00:05:07,716
I wonder why.

112
00:05:07,717 --> 00:05:10,024
I wonder why Woo Shik is so worried.

113
00:05:10,556 --> 00:05:12,658
You idiot. I'm telling you, that's not true!

114
00:05:12,796 --> 00:05:15,609
You idiot! It's not true!

115
00:05:17,197 --> 00:05:20,287
That stupid Lee Jun Ki has a knack for infuriating people.

116
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:22,525
Why would I care about Soo Yeon?

117
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:24,750
What? First love?

118
00:05:25,137 --> 00:05:27,299
It's already been over 10 years.

119
00:05:28,207 --> 00:05:29,346
- Shower time. - Oh, my.

120
00:05:29,347 --> 00:05:31,415
- You scared me. - What are you doing?

121
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,016
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were here.

122
00:05:33,017 --> 00:05:35,615
Get out this instant. Get out!

123
00:05:35,616 --> 00:05:36,678
Why are you getting mad?

124
00:05:37,347 --> 00:05:39,375
What's the big deal? We're both guys.

125
00:05:39,887 --> 00:05:42,255
Why? Are you embarrassed?

126
00:05:42,256 --> 00:05:43,493
Should I scrub your back?

127
00:05:46,157 --> 00:05:48,155
This is a new miracle cream.

128
00:05:49,397 --> 00:05:50,910
Try some samples.

129
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:53,998
This is a new miracle cream.

130
00:05:56,306 --> 00:05:59,530
Hey, what's wrong with your voice? Can't you do better than that?

131
00:06:00,506 --> 00:06:01,646
I'm sorry.

132
00:06:01,647 --> 00:06:02,946
Why? Is it because you're embarrassed?

133
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:04,626
Just quit then.

134
00:06:05,017 --> 00:06:06,521
No.

135
00:06:07,577 --> 00:06:10,545
- I'll do better. - This is really your last warning.

136
00:06:10,546 --> 00:06:11,690
Okay.

137
00:06:13,387 --> 00:06:15,076
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

138
00:06:15,486 --> 00:06:16,620
Shall I just quit?

139
00:06:17,186 --> 00:06:19,627
No. If I do that, Woo Shik will laugh at me.

140
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:23,878
But this is way too embarrassing. What should I do?

141
00:06:27,837 --> 00:06:31,036
This morning, a brown bear escaped its cage...

142
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:34,476
- at Hanguk Zoo. - Oh, my goodness.

143
00:06:34,907 --> 00:06:36,080
A bear?

144
00:06:37,347 --> 00:06:38,552
Hello.

145
00:06:40,217 --> 00:06:41,586
(Breaking News, 1 Brown Bear Escapes Hanguk Zoo)

146
00:06:46,457 --> 00:06:47,693
Where's beer?

147
00:06:48,256 --> 00:06:49,359
My eyes are burning.

148
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:52,129
Gosh, seriously. What the...

149
00:06:52,227 --> 00:06:54,896
Hey, how could you do that to me?

150
00:06:54,897 --> 00:06:56,338
I told you to get out.

151
00:06:56,397 --> 00:06:58,696
Still, how could you throw the soup at my face?

152
00:06:58,697 --> 00:07:00,665
What would you have done if it had hit my eye?

153
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,966
Hey, how could a friend do such a thing?

154
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:05,099
Did you two fight again? Why?

155
00:07:05,337 --> 00:07:09,323
He threw such a fit just because I walked in as he was taking a shower.

156
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:12,502
I'm telling you. This guy is so fussy.

157
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:14,745
Back in school, he even went to the washroom...

158
00:07:14,746 --> 00:07:17,286
to change into the gym uniform so that no one could see him.

159
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:19,275
- Why? - How would I know?

160
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:23,148
It's not like that thing would disappear if people saw it.

161
00:07:23,356 --> 00:07:24,562
Hey, why do you do that?

162
00:07:26,926 --> 00:07:28,165
Are you not confident or what?

163
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,917
What? Why wouldn't I be confident?

164
00:07:30,227 --> 00:07:32,194
Hey, I'm... You see,

165
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:34,196
the ob-gyn...

166
00:07:34,197 --> 00:07:37,461
I mean, when Dr. Choi Dal Bong saw me as soon as I was born,

167
00:07:37,736 --> 00:07:40,175
he felt so shocked...

168
00:07:40,176 --> 00:07:41,776
that he quit his job as a doctor altogether.

169
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:43,305
Don't lie to my face.

170
00:07:43,306 --> 00:07:46,541
- Hey, then show me. Let me see! - See what?

171
00:07:46,546 --> 00:07:47,752
Gosh, forget it.

172
00:07:47,876 --> 00:07:49,391
If you don't want to believe me, just don't.

173
00:07:49,447 --> 00:07:50,586
Everyone can bluff like that.

174
00:07:50,587 --> 00:07:52,956
Hey, mine is... My gosh, enough. Let's drop this.

175
00:07:53,957 --> 00:07:55,089
Hey, Jung Eun.

176
00:07:55,486 --> 00:07:57,026
I asked you to come up with an idea of promotion.

177
00:07:57,027 --> 00:07:58,555
Why are you watching TV?

178
00:07:58,556 --> 00:08:00,143
I'm just taking a quick break.

179
00:08:00,556 --> 00:08:03,141
- Hey, look. It's so fascinating. - What?

180
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,593
If I don't do this,

181
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:07,295
I can't live because it's too cold.

182
00:08:07,296 --> 00:08:10,294
- 40°C? - That woman gets cold very easily.

183
00:08:10,337 --> 00:08:12,305
She has to bundle up like that...

184
00:08:12,306 --> 00:08:13,851
even when the heat is jacked up to 40 Celsius degrees.

185
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:17,338
- She can't even go out in summer. - What?

186
00:08:18,347 --> 00:08:20,541
- She gets cold very easily? - Yes.

187
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:22,638
People can be on TV for something like that?

188
00:08:22,686 --> 00:08:23,685
Don't you know that show?

189
00:08:23,686 --> 00:08:25,755
They feature people who are unusual and quirky.

190
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:26,848
Really?

191
00:08:28,626 --> 00:08:30,456
Hey, we should be on that show too.

192
00:08:30,457 --> 00:08:32,196
It'll naturally help us promote our guesthouse.

193
00:08:32,197 --> 00:08:34,796
I guess it will, but we have nothing unusual to be featured on the show.

194
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:36,342
We'll think of something.

195
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:40,755
Hey, I can cry in 10 seconds.

196
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:42,241
Do you want to see it?

197
00:08:42,467 --> 00:08:45,700
10, 9, 8, 7,

198
00:08:45,906 --> 00:08:47,483
6, 5...

199
00:08:49,146 --> 00:08:50,547
You see this, right?

200
00:08:51,307 --> 00:08:53,923
- You see my tears, right? - It is pretty cool,

201
00:08:54,276 --> 00:08:55,885
but can you do something about the snot?

202
00:08:55,886 --> 00:08:58,009
The snot? I can't.

203
00:08:58,616 --> 00:09:00,646
It comes out automatically when I cry.

204
00:09:01,827 --> 00:09:03,326
But I can make snot come out without tears.

205
00:09:03,327 --> 00:09:05,226
I can even shoot it horizontally at you guys.

206
00:09:05,227 --> 00:09:07,390
- Hey, that's too disgusting. - Is it?

207
00:09:08,866 --> 00:09:10,823
Guys, do you have any skills?

208
00:09:12,197 --> 00:09:14,504
I have one special skill.

209
00:09:14,766 --> 00:09:16,826
Okay, I'll start.

210
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:20,579
("Flower" by Kim Chun Su)

211
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:25,280
My, she's actually typing.

212
00:09:26,077 --> 00:09:27,281
- Go, Jung Eun! - My gosh!

213
00:09:27,746 --> 00:09:29,157
We'll be on TV!

214
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,285
- Guys, isn't this cool? - You can actually do this. Amazing!

215
00:09:33,286 --> 00:09:34,522
It's easier to type with my toes.

216
00:09:35,827 --> 00:09:37,577
Why? What's wrong?

217
00:09:37,587 --> 00:09:38,833
My toes are cramping.

218
00:09:39,197 --> 00:09:40,432
- What? - Do something!

219
00:09:41,057 --> 00:09:42,158
What's going on?

220
00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:44,285
I can type most things with my toes,

221
00:09:44,427 --> 00:09:46,265
but I can only do it for 10 seconds.

222
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:47,399
10 seconds?

223
00:09:48,036 --> 00:09:50,436
Gosh. Then this is no good either. 10 seconds is nothing.

224
00:09:51,536 --> 00:09:52,669
Well...

225
00:09:53,707 --> 00:09:54,984
I have a skill too.

226
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:15,674
Hold on a second. What did I just see?

227
00:10:15,797 --> 00:10:17,166
What do you say? Isn't it cool?

228
00:10:17,927 --> 00:10:19,306
Hasn't it been done too many times?

229
00:10:19,837 --> 00:10:22,381
I think I've seen many people who do it better than you on TV.

230
00:10:22,406 --> 00:10:23,849
I guess many people can do it,

231
00:10:23,937 --> 00:10:26,505
but no one can play it as beautifully as I do.

232
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:27,773
Mine is heart-wrenching.

233
00:10:28,077 --> 00:10:29,346
The sound carries a sense of sorrow.

234
00:10:29,347 --> 00:10:30,614
Sorrow, my foot.

235
00:10:31,347 --> 00:10:33,510
Hey, this won't do.

236
00:10:33,616 --> 00:10:35,086
Do you guys have any other skills?

237
00:10:35,087 --> 00:10:37,208
- I'm home. - Hey, you're back.

238
00:10:37,616 --> 00:10:39,646
Hey, aren't you cold? My goodness.

239
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:42,961
It's freezing outside. Why are you dressed like that?

240
00:10:44,356 --> 00:10:46,623
My gosh, you're even drinking iced coffee.

241
00:10:46,797 --> 00:10:48,547
I get hot easily, you know.

242
00:10:48,697 --> 00:10:51,096
I'm a man of boiling passion.

243
00:10:51,126 --> 00:10:53,096
Sure, keep on boiling.

244
00:10:53,097 --> 00:10:54,611
Gosh, I'm sick of this.

245
00:10:54,797 --> 00:10:55,939
Hold on.

246
00:10:56,837 --> 00:11:00,101
Hey, that woman on the show earlier...

247
00:11:00,776 --> 00:11:02,245
You said she gets cold easily.

248
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:03,441
Yes. What about it?

249
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:07,718
Hey, Ki Bong. Since you're a man of "boiling passion",

250
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:09,284
you probably never feel cold.

251
00:11:09,717 --> 00:11:11,365
Well... Yes, I'd say that.

252
00:11:12,957 --> 00:11:14,398
Is that so?

253
00:11:19,457 --> 00:11:21,620
- Anybody here? - Yes, who is it?

254
00:11:22,297 --> 00:11:23,625
- Hello. - Hello.

255
00:11:23,626 --> 00:11:27,448
I'm the producer of "How Is That Possible", Lee Si Eon.

256
00:11:27,636 --> 00:11:30,211
Oh, right. Hello, nice to meet you.

257
00:11:30,506 --> 00:11:32,206
I'm Lee Jun Ki, the one who sent the story.

258
00:11:32,207 --> 00:11:33,618
I see.

259
00:11:33,977 --> 00:11:37,405
You said you know someone who never feels cold.

260
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:39,375
- Is it really true? - Yes, it's my friend.

261
00:11:39,376 --> 00:11:42,515
He doesn't get cold. He never feels cold, ever.

262
00:11:42,516 --> 00:11:43,680
Oh, I see.

263
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:44,985
Where is he now?

264
00:11:44,986 --> 00:11:46,686
- He's on the rooftop now. - On the rooftop?

265
00:11:46,687 --> 00:11:47,755
- Let me take you there. - Okay.

266
00:11:47,756 --> 00:11:48,993
Come on in.

267
00:11:49,057 --> 00:11:50,736
Let's go.

268
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:56,315
Can we really do this?

269
00:11:57,366 --> 00:11:58,530
I'm getting a bad feeling.

270
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:02,070
Oh, there he is.

271
00:12:02,837 --> 00:12:04,793
He's out here on this cold day?

272
00:12:04,866 --> 00:12:06,833
- With a fan on? - Yes.

273
00:12:06,837 --> 00:12:08,375
We've tried to stop him,

274
00:12:08,376 --> 00:12:11,395
- but he doesn't listen to us. - Lee Jun Ki, that jerk.

275
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:14,330
- Ki Bong! - Yes, what's up?

276
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:16,786
- Would you like to meet him? - Ki Bong, right? Ki Bong.

277
00:12:18,687 --> 00:12:21,745
Ki Bong, a TV show producer is here to meet you.

278
00:12:22,356 --> 00:12:24,985
I heard you never feel cold.

279
00:12:24,986 --> 00:12:26,233
- Is it true? - Pardon?

280
00:12:28,156 --> 00:12:29,506
Oh, yes. It's true.

281
00:12:29,766 --> 00:12:32,959
You look cold though. And your lips seem to be slightly trembling.

282
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:37,436
No, no. That's just because he's magnesium deficient.

283
00:12:37,437 --> 00:12:38,641
I see.

284
00:12:40,606 --> 00:12:43,325
- But he even has some goosebumps. - Sorry?

285
00:12:45,646 --> 00:12:48,912
No, no. That's just his skin. He was born with skin like that.

286
00:12:48,947 --> 00:12:51,007
He's always been insecure about it.

287
00:12:51,016 --> 00:12:52,119
It's one of my insecurities.

288
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:53,550
I don't buy it.

289
00:12:54,317 --> 00:12:56,592
I think he looks cold.

290
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:58,787
I said you're wrong. Why do you keep doubting us?

291
00:12:58,827 --> 00:13:01,025
Do you not believe us?

292
00:13:01,026 --> 00:13:03,746
Gosh, don't get me wrong. My apologies.

293
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,194
It's just that we've been getting so many false stories lately.

294
00:13:07,236 --> 00:13:09,637
Ki Bong, he doesn't seem to believe us.

295
00:13:09,937 --> 00:13:11,934
- Just show him. - What?

296
00:13:12,977 --> 00:13:14,378
- Show him what? - What do you think?

297
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:16,576
You're wearing that not to get tanned.

298
00:13:16,577 --> 00:13:18,091
You usually don't even wear a shirt.

299
00:13:18,146 --> 00:13:20,076
Come on. The producer doesn't believe us.

300
00:13:20,077 --> 00:13:21,622
Just show him.

301
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,776
- Take it off. - Okay, sure.

302
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:26,649
I didn't want to get tanned.

303
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,586
- The UV rays are strong, you know. - My gosh, will you be okay?

304
00:13:29,587 --> 00:13:31,276
- It's freezing now. - He'll be totally fine.

305
00:13:31,386 --> 00:13:34,384
- Sometimes, he walks around naked. - Take photos.

306
00:13:34,526 --> 00:13:35,625
- Right, friend? - That looks perfect.

307
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:37,418
Yes, that's right.

308
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:40,040
That's great. Please sit back...

309
00:14:07,327 --> 00:14:09,525
We're having a promotion for a newly launched facial cream!

310
00:14:09,526 --> 00:14:11,010
Come and get your free samples.

311
00:14:11,427 --> 00:14:12,879
Get your free samples!

312
00:14:13,097 --> 00:14:14,611
Come on over.

313
00:14:15,207 --> 00:14:17,765
An opportunity like this doesn't come by every day.

314
00:14:17,766 --> 00:14:20,969
- All right. - You totally got the hang of it.

315
00:14:21,177 --> 00:14:22,897
Gosh, this is a piece of cake.

316
00:14:24,047 --> 00:14:25,931
I need to run to the washroom to wipe my sweat.

317
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,211
Sure, go ahead.

318
00:14:27,317 --> 00:14:28,862
- Be quick. - Okay.

319
00:14:31,616 --> 00:14:32,750
Next news.

320
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:36,516
The brown bear that escaped Hanguk Zoo this morning...

321
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:38,335
has been spotted near Namsan.

322
00:14:38,756 --> 00:14:41,404
About 100 agents and experts from the SWAT Team,

323
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:42,895
the Special Rescue Squad,

324
00:14:42,896 --> 00:14:45,596
and the Animal Rescue Association are searching the area now.

325
00:14:45,597 --> 00:14:47,626
My gosh, Namsan? That's very close.

326
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:49,884
That's so dangerous.

327
00:15:00,746 --> 00:15:03,733
What's going on? Why is the light flickering?

328
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:07,134
Gosh, I'm already so dizzy.

329
00:15:07,717 --> 00:15:08,921
I'm so hot in this thing.

330
00:15:09,457 --> 00:15:10,692
I should wash up quickly.

331
00:15:14,727 --> 00:15:18,064
Gosh, darn it.

332
00:15:29,447 --> 00:15:30,611
What is that thing?

333
00:15:40,516 --> 00:15:42,689
No way. Is that the bear?

334
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:50,166
It's so cold today.

335
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:52,635
So you're saying he's practically been living out here all winter?

336
00:15:52,636 --> 00:15:54,535
That's right. He didn't even want this tent,

337
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:58,688
but we almost begged him to at least stay in it.

338
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,375
Then what about food?

339
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:04,642
He doesn't really eat food because it makes him hot.

340
00:16:04,707 --> 00:16:06,676
He only eats ice cream all day.

341
00:16:06,677 --> 00:16:08,275
- Only ice cream? - Ice cream?

342
00:16:08,276 --> 00:16:09,863
Right, Ki Bong?

343
00:16:11,016 --> 00:16:13,285
Oh, yes.

344
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:15,244
In case you don't believe me, I'll show you.

345
00:16:16,856 --> 00:16:19,096
Oh, my.

346
00:16:19,097 --> 00:16:21,672
Well, Ki Bong. Here's your meal.

347
00:16:28,496 --> 00:16:30,635
- It looks so tasty. - Let me see.

348
00:16:30,636 --> 00:16:31,836
Shoot this cooler.

349
00:16:31,837 --> 00:16:33,735
- Here. A spoon. - A spoon?

350
00:16:33,736 --> 00:16:35,147
My goodness.

351
00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:41,560
- I mean... - It looks so tasty.

352
00:16:42,246 --> 00:16:43,895
- A big spoonful. - He hasn't yet eaten anything.

353
00:16:46,957 --> 00:16:48,780
Gosh, your teeth must ache.

354
00:16:49,557 --> 00:16:51,826
That's incredible.

355
00:16:51,827 --> 00:16:53,726
- This is... - He loves it...

356
00:16:53,727 --> 00:16:55,125
when I throw these at him.

357
00:16:55,126 --> 00:16:56,507
I see.

358
00:16:58,467 --> 00:16:59,631
This is much better.

359
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:03,408
I should get back to work.

360
00:17:13,576 --> 00:17:14,916
Why am I feeling nauseous?

361
00:17:15,316 --> 00:17:17,202
Did I drink too much beer?

362
00:17:27,127 --> 00:17:29,083
Over here!

363
00:17:31,326 --> 00:17:33,118
- Did you report? - Yes.

364
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:34,609
Where's the bear?

365
00:17:34,736 --> 00:17:37,735
It's in the bathroom over there.

366
00:17:37,736 --> 00:17:39,606
In the bathroom? Are you sure you're not mistaken?

367
00:17:39,607 --> 00:17:42,906
Gosh, I saw it with my own two eyes.

368
00:17:42,907 --> 00:17:45,775
It was rummaging through the trash can and making a mess.

369
00:17:45,776 --> 00:17:46,847
Really?

370
00:17:56,556 --> 00:17:58,626
Do you hear the roar?

371
00:17:58,627 --> 00:18:00,450
My goodness, it was true.

372
00:18:01,796 --> 00:18:02,826
This is not good.

373
00:18:02,996 --> 00:18:04,795
Judging from the roar,

374
00:18:04,796 --> 00:18:06,794
the bear must be very angry.

375
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,516
Let's get it over with before it gets more upset.

376
00:18:08,736 --> 00:18:09,766
Let's go.

377
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:19,664
I feel a bit better now.

378
00:18:34,056 --> 00:18:36,332
It is a bear.

379
00:18:37,127 --> 00:18:38,919
But can a bear drink water standing on two feet?

380
00:18:39,236 --> 00:18:42,866
Of course. Bears are very agile.

381
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:44,466
I think this is our chance.

382
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:46,156
Hurry up and shoot the tranquilizer gun.

383
00:19:04,187 --> 00:19:08,276
Three bears are in the house

384
00:19:08,326 --> 00:19:10,265
Daddy bear, mommy...

385
00:19:10,266 --> 00:19:12,872
Excuse me. What is this?

386
00:19:15,096 --> 00:19:18,124
He's going to kill Ki Bong.

387
00:19:19,637 --> 00:19:22,077
I wonder how Soo Yeon is doing.

388
00:19:22,447 --> 00:19:23,847
Has she been fired yet?

389
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:28,757
Wait. It's none of my business even if she gets fired.

390
00:19:29,447 --> 00:19:30,477
That's right.

391
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:32,442
Woo Shik, look at this.

392
00:19:33,086 --> 00:19:35,074
What is it now?

393
00:19:36,256 --> 00:19:38,008
What do you think? Isn't it incredible?

394
00:19:38,256 --> 00:19:39,995
Have you ever seen someone eat ramyeon with their feet?

395
00:19:39,996 --> 00:19:42,295
Don't you think this is way more interesting than Ki Bong's?

396
00:19:42,296 --> 00:19:44,265
It is interesting. I mean what's inside your head.

397
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,265
I just don't think it's fair.

398
00:19:46,266 --> 00:19:48,936
Why did I lose to Ki Bong?

399
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,378
This is way more exciting.

400
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:52,986
I got a cramp.

401
00:19:53,437 --> 00:19:54,676
- Gosh. - Do something.

402
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:56,974
You shouldn't have obsessed over something like this.

403
00:19:57,246 --> 00:19:59,306
No one in this house is normal.

404
00:19:59,576 --> 00:20:00,845
- Harder. - Is it here?

405
00:20:00,846 --> 00:20:01,876
Yes.

406
00:20:02,316 --> 00:20:04,845
A brown bear escaped from Seoul's largest theme park...

407
00:20:04,846 --> 00:20:05,916
A brown bear?

408
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:08,416
A brown bear escaped from the zoo.

409
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:10,025
Everyone has been making a fuss about it all day.

410
00:20:10,026 --> 00:20:11,926
- You didn't know? - Really?

411
00:20:11,927 --> 00:20:14,896
A woman was mistaken for the brown bear...

412
00:20:14,897 --> 00:20:17,131
and shot with a tranquillizer.

413
00:20:17,596 --> 00:20:20,140
This clip is from a citizen.

414
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:21,975
Wake up!

415
00:20:23,036 --> 00:20:26,745
As soon as I heard the roar, I shot the tranquillizer gun.

416
00:20:27,076 --> 00:20:28,138
What's that?

417
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:55,635
Soo Yeon, are you okay?

418
00:20:56,036 --> 00:20:58,335
Soo Yeon, open your eyes.

419
00:20:58,336 --> 00:21:00,775
Be quiet. People are staring.

420
00:21:00,776 --> 00:21:02,115
This is so embarrassing.

421
00:21:02,546 --> 00:21:04,406
Are you okay? Are you sure?

422
00:21:04,407 --> 00:21:05,509
Yes.

423
00:21:09,387 --> 00:21:11,343
Why do you keep getting in trouble?

424
00:21:11,816 --> 00:21:12,846
I'm sorry.

425
00:21:13,486 --> 00:21:16,585
Why are you so angry? Since when did you care about me?

426
00:21:16,586 --> 00:21:17,658
I care about you?

427
00:21:18,286 --> 00:21:20,254
It's not that I care about you.

428
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:23,411
I'm just worried that we'll have to pay for it again.

429
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:26,265
Hey! How can you say that when I'm not even feeling well?

430
00:21:26,266 --> 00:21:27,987
You look just fine.

431
00:21:29,766 --> 00:21:31,105
Get up. Let's go home.

432
00:21:32,736 --> 00:21:33,869
Wait for me.

433
00:21:34,937 --> 00:21:35,977
Hey!

434
00:21:36,177 --> 00:21:38,176
You want me to go in there?

435
00:21:38,177 --> 00:21:41,476
Yes. Otherwise, the viewers won't believe it.

436
00:21:41,477 --> 00:21:42,485
Right?

437
00:21:42,486 --> 00:21:45,085
You're right. Being on TV is not a joke.

438
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:46,116
We have to do it.

439
00:21:47,957 --> 00:21:50,686
Ki Bong, you can do it, right?

440
00:21:50,687 --> 00:21:53,540
I can't. I really can't.

441
00:21:53,556 --> 00:21:55,616
Yes, you can.

442
00:21:55,727 --> 00:21:57,684
You're a man of boiling passion.

443
00:21:58,927 --> 00:22:01,035
Also, I'm afraid this can look...

444
00:22:01,036 --> 00:22:03,035
a bit boring.

445
00:22:03,036 --> 00:22:06,888
So we'll put a little bit of ice in the pool.

446
00:22:06,937 --> 00:22:09,045
You'll put ice in the pool?

447
00:22:09,046 --> 00:22:10,139
Yes.

448
00:22:10,207 --> 00:22:11,906
That sounds great.

449
00:22:11,907 --> 00:22:13,215
I was actually going to do that.

450
00:22:13,546 --> 00:22:14,680
He loves it.

451
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,327
Ki Bong, you can do it,

452
00:22:17,717 --> 00:22:18,985
right?

453
00:22:18,986 --> 00:22:21,255
No, I can't. This is too much.

454
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,525
I can't go into icy water in this cold.

455
00:22:23,526 --> 00:22:25,484
Yes, you can.

456
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:26,657
So...

457
00:22:28,227 --> 00:22:32,038
grit your teeth and go into the water just once, okay?

458
00:22:46,546 --> 00:22:48,045
All right, go in.

459
00:22:48,046 --> 00:22:50,519
Well, okay.

460
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,095
It's too cold. It's really cold.

461
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,013
My toes will freeze.

462
00:23:02,096 --> 00:23:03,363
You're just imagining it.

463
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:04,830
We're almost there.

464
00:23:05,127 --> 00:23:06,950
Go in right now. Hurry up.

465
00:23:30,887 --> 00:23:33,126
Is it cold, by any chance?

466
00:23:33,127 --> 00:23:34,356
It seems like you want to scream.

467
00:23:34,357 --> 00:23:35,592
That's not it.

468
00:23:35,826 --> 00:23:37,265
He just loves it so much.

469
00:23:37,266 --> 00:23:38,977
"I love this!"

470
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,293
- Like that. - I love this!

471
00:23:42,637 --> 00:23:43,841
Yes!

472
00:23:44,806 --> 00:23:46,279
He does this when he's happy.

473
00:23:47,877 --> 00:23:50,317
You've seen how much he likes it. Are we done now?

474
00:23:50,506 --> 00:23:51,646
Hold on.

475
00:23:51,647 --> 00:23:54,146
Before we wrap up, can you go underwater once?

476
00:23:54,147 --> 00:23:55,897
- You jerk... - Well...

477
00:23:56,986 --> 00:23:58,799
How did you know he's good at that?

478
00:23:59,786 --> 00:24:00,992
Just a second.

479
00:24:01,086 --> 00:24:03,485
Ki Bong, show him.

480
00:24:03,486 --> 00:24:05,176
You even have a diving certification.

481
00:24:05,256 --> 00:24:06,493
You can do this.

482
00:24:07,296 --> 00:24:09,166
No, I can't. I'm serious.

483
00:24:09,167 --> 00:24:11,166
I can never go underwater.

484
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:12,712
Just get it over with.

485
00:24:12,967 --> 00:24:15,572
After this, we can go on TV.

486
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:16,765
Do it.

487
00:24:16,766 --> 00:24:19,136
I think I'm going to die.

488
00:24:19,137 --> 00:24:21,032
You're just imagining it.

489
00:24:21,107 --> 00:24:23,723
You're a man with a burning heart.

490
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:25,694
You're so mean.

491
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,985
My goodness. He really did it.

492
00:24:34,986 --> 00:24:36,985
He can definitely not feel the cold.

493
00:24:36,986 --> 00:24:38,016
Let's decide on the date.

494
00:24:38,586 --> 00:24:41,325
Well, did we pass?

495
00:24:41,326 --> 00:24:42,456
Of course.

496
00:24:42,457 --> 00:24:43,666
He can come out now.

497
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:44,666
Really?

498
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:46,727
Ki Bong, we're done. Come out!

499
00:24:47,137 --> 00:24:48,435
When will it air?

500
00:24:48,637 --> 00:24:50,835
- In a couple of weeks. - In a couple of weeks?

501
00:24:50,836 --> 00:24:52,865
What are you waiting for, Ki Bong? Come out!

502
00:24:53,477 --> 00:24:54,476
Hey!

503
00:24:54,477 --> 00:24:55,919
- Put it together nicely. - Ki Bong!

504
00:24:56,907 --> 00:24:59,008
Ki Bong!

505
00:24:59,316 --> 00:25:00,450
Ki Bong!

506
00:25:01,147 --> 00:25:02,970
Ki Bong!

507
00:25:03,617 --> 00:25:04,987
Wait for me.

508
00:25:06,556 --> 00:25:07,755
I said, wait for me.

509
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:08,921
Hurry up.

510
00:25:13,727 --> 00:25:15,241
Walk a bit slower.

511
00:25:18,326 --> 00:25:19,676
This is embarrassing.

512
00:25:20,236 --> 00:25:22,196
Why couldn't you bring some clothes for me?

513
00:25:22,197 --> 00:25:24,226
You were even on the news. Why do you feel embarrassed now?

514
00:25:24,437 --> 00:25:27,423
What? I was on the news? What are you talking about?

515
00:25:30,576 --> 00:25:31,988
You didn't know?

516
00:25:33,647 --> 00:25:36,056
Hey. Look.

517
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:39,656
You're the most searched person online right now too.

518
00:25:40,086 --> 00:25:41,356
"Tranquilized bear girl".

519
00:25:41,357 --> 00:25:42,386
(Tranquilized bear girl)

520
00:25:42,387 --> 00:25:43,901
That's you. Look.

521
00:25:46,657 --> 00:25:47,687
What is this?

522
00:25:48,127 --> 00:25:49,846
Gosh, this is crazy.

523
00:25:50,096 --> 00:25:52,126
I shouldn't have taken that job in the first place.

524
00:25:52,127 --> 00:25:53,765
I'll never do it again.

525
00:25:53,766 --> 00:25:54,900
What do you mean?

526
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,182
Are you quitting already?

527
00:25:57,766 --> 00:25:58,837
Well...

528
00:26:00,006 --> 00:26:02,335
It's too hard and humiliating. I can't stand it anymore.

529
00:26:02,336 --> 00:26:04,716
Soo Yeon, why don't you grow up?

530
00:26:05,877 --> 00:26:07,376
- What? - You don't want to do things...

531
00:26:07,377 --> 00:26:09,611
that are tough, embarrassing or boring.

532
00:26:10,086 --> 00:26:11,796
Then what will you do?

533
00:26:13,016 --> 00:26:15,015
Don't you want to bring your dad back?

534
00:26:16,256 --> 00:26:19,831
Soo Yeon, you can't always do what you want to do in life.

535
00:26:20,296 --> 00:26:22,254
You have to do things you don't like and just put up with it.

536
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:24,043
Everyone in the world lives like that.

537
00:26:24,227 --> 00:26:25,565
Jun Ki, Ki Bong,

538
00:26:25,566 --> 00:26:27,166
Jung Eun, and I live like that too.

539
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:28,371
We all live that way.

540
00:26:28,397 --> 00:26:31,084
So you should get used to living like that too.

541
00:26:31,407 --> 00:26:34,836
You must overcome any difficulties on your own. Do you understand?

542
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:40,078
I understand.

543
00:26:41,816 --> 00:26:43,434
I'll do it then.

544
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:46,789
Are you hungry?

545
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:48,962
There's a place that sells some delicious hotteok nearby.

546
00:26:49,427 --> 00:26:50,518
Hotteok?

547
00:26:51,127 --> 00:26:53,218
But I want some steak.

548
00:26:53,296 --> 00:26:54,800
Forget it if you don't want it.

549
00:26:55,026 --> 00:26:56,540
No, I'll eat it.

550
00:26:57,066 --> 00:26:59,776
Instead, can you buy me two hotteoks?

551
00:27:02,197 --> 00:27:03,636
- Okay, fine. - Two?

552
00:27:03,637 --> 00:27:05,799
Yes. Stay away from me, you're scaring me.

553
00:27:05,867 --> 00:27:07,606
Ki Bong, are you okay?

554
00:27:07,607 --> 00:27:09,545
Ki Bong, please hang in there.

555
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:10,639
What happened?

556
00:27:11,246 --> 00:27:12,761
What's wrong with Ki Bong?

557
00:27:12,846 --> 00:27:14,116
Well, it's...

558
00:27:14,117 --> 00:27:16,723
Why was he swimming in icy water in this cold?

559
00:27:16,846 --> 00:27:18,948
Well, the thing is...

560
00:27:19,187 --> 00:27:22,015
My friend Ki Bong is the most passionate man in this world...

561
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:24,190
- who never feels cold. - Quiet!

562
00:27:24,427 --> 00:27:26,003
There's no person like that in this world.

563
00:27:26,197 --> 00:27:28,795
Are you aware that he almost died of hypothermia?

564
00:27:28,796 --> 00:27:30,723
- I'm sorry. - Let's go.

565
00:27:30,967 --> 00:27:33,470
Jun Ki, I'm cold.

566
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:35,075
I feel so cold.

567
00:27:35,137 --> 00:27:36,606
I'll go visit you later.

568
00:27:36,607 --> 00:27:37,801
Ki Bong.

569
00:27:39,707 --> 00:27:42,179
Hey. I knew something was fishy.

570
00:27:42,207 --> 00:27:44,616
You were willing to go this far to appear on TV?

571
00:27:45,076 --> 00:27:47,446
- I'm sorry. - I knew it.

572
00:27:47,447 --> 00:27:48,992
I told you not to do it!

573
00:27:49,717 --> 00:27:51,333
This is so humiliating.

574
00:27:55,217 --> 00:27:56,874
I wasted my time.

575
00:27:57,727 --> 00:27:58,891
Let's go.

576
00:27:58,957 --> 00:28:00,089
Hold on.

578
00:28:09,867 --> 00:28:11,690
Sir, what do you think of this?

579
00:28:11,707 --> 00:28:13,632
Isn't it truly fascinating?

580
00:28:13,937 --> 00:28:16,481
If this airs, this country will be on a frenzy.

581
00:28:16,977 --> 00:28:20,416
I have a cramp. I have a cramp on my foot.

582
00:28:20,816 --> 00:28:22,146
Don't mind her.

583
00:28:22,147 --> 00:28:23,545
- I'm sorry. - I can't move.

584
00:28:23,546 --> 00:28:25,916
By the way, where is the bathroom?

585
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:27,668
Oh, it's right over there.

586
00:28:27,717 --> 00:28:29,024
Thank you.

587
00:28:30,927 --> 00:28:33,573
Oh, my. I'm sorry. I thought this was the bathroom.

588
00:28:36,427 --> 00:28:38,196
- Wait a minute. - What are you doing?

589
00:28:38,197 --> 00:28:39,813
- Get out. - Wait.

590
00:28:40,096 --> 00:28:41,992
What is... This...

591
00:28:44,036 --> 00:28:46,376
- What is wrong with this? - What do you mean?

592
00:28:46,377 --> 00:28:47,849
I told you to get out!

593
00:28:48,576 --> 00:28:50,534
Why is this here? It shouldn't be there,

594
00:28:51,276 --> 00:28:52,584
should it?

595
00:28:53,016 --> 00:28:55,416
Mr. Cha. Mr. Cha, I'm begging you.

596
00:28:55,816 --> 00:28:57,639
Can you just come out on our show?

597
00:28:57,786 --> 00:28:59,716
This is an incredible item.

598
00:28:59,717 --> 00:29:02,485
- I said no. What's wrong with you? - Woo Shik.

599
00:29:02,486 --> 00:29:05,721
Are those really attached down here?

600
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,991
I'm telling you, they're really down here.

601
00:29:10,296 --> 00:29:13,324
That's why you overreacted when I walked in on you showering.

602
00:29:14,066 --> 00:29:15,302
Can you believe this?

603
00:29:15,467 --> 00:29:18,319
Hey. Are you a goat or what?

604
00:29:18,607 --> 00:29:20,936
Wait. I've thought of the title!

605
00:29:20,937 --> 00:29:22,275
"The Goatman of Huam-dong".

606
00:29:22,276 --> 00:29:24,305
I guarantee you this will be a huge hit!

607
00:29:24,306 --> 00:29:26,819
- We must shoot this. - I said no.

608
00:29:26,947 --> 00:29:28,625
I'll never do it. Never.

609
00:29:28,746 --> 00:29:30,641
Just go out on TV for our sake.

610
00:29:30,846 --> 00:29:33,359
- Think of our business. - This is my insecurity.

611
00:29:33,687 --> 00:29:34,956
Anyway, I can't do this. I won't.

612
00:29:34,957 --> 00:29:36,785
I'll never do it. Over my dead body!

613
00:29:36,786 --> 00:29:37,961
Woo Shik.

614
00:29:38,727 --> 00:29:39,891
You're unbelievable.

615
00:29:40,157 --> 00:29:41,426
How could you speak with a forked tongue?

616
00:29:41,427 --> 00:29:42,426
What are you talking about?

617
00:29:42,427 --> 00:29:44,425
You said you can't always do what you want to do in life.

618
00:29:44,727 --> 00:29:46,636
You said you have to do difficult things too.

619
00:29:46,637 --> 00:29:48,244
Those are the words that came out of your mouth.

620
00:29:49,506 --> 00:29:50,598
Goodness.

621
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:52,681
Don't speak with a forked tongue.

622
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:01,745
- It's on. - At a guest house in Seoul,

623
00:30:01,746 --> 00:30:03,416
there is a man called...

624
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:05,919
- "The Goatman of Huam-dong". - That's us!

625
00:30:06,357 --> 00:30:08,313
- This is exciting. - To check if it was true,

626
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:10,898
- we paid him a visit. - Hello?

627
00:30:10,927 --> 00:30:12,956
Welcome to Waikiki Guesthouse.

628
00:30:12,957 --> 00:30:14,095
Hello.

629
00:30:14,096 --> 00:30:15,806
Yes, welcome.

630
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:19,226
- Hey, it's me. It's me! - It's you.

631
00:30:19,227 --> 00:30:20,936
You really are an actor. You look handsome.

632
00:30:20,937 --> 00:30:23,028
- Welcome. Come on in. - Okay.

633
00:30:25,336 --> 00:30:26,876
- He's over there. - Over there?

634
00:30:26,877 --> 00:30:28,216
- Yes. - I see.

635
00:30:31,776 --> 00:30:34,629
Hello. Are you the Goatman of Huam-dong?

636
00:30:36,286 --> 00:30:38,203
Oh, yes. Hello.

637
00:30:38,717 --> 00:30:41,285
(The man known as the Goatman of Huam-dong, Cha Woo Shik)

638
00:30:41,286 --> 00:30:44,274
I heard they're located differently compared to ordinary people.

639
00:30:44,357 --> 00:30:45,829
- Yes! - Yes!

640
00:30:47,227 --> 00:30:49,802
Yes. Unlike ordinary people,

641
00:30:49,967 --> 00:30:51,926
they are located at a very low position.

642
00:30:51,927 --> 00:30:52,967
I see.

643
00:30:53,137 --> 00:30:55,936
By any chance, can you show us?

644
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,173
- Yes! - Yes!

645
00:30:57,407 --> 00:30:58,499
This is embarrassing.

646
00:31:06,677 --> 00:31:10,216
- I can't believe you really did it! - The staff was worried...

647
00:31:10,217 --> 00:31:11,833
whether there was something wrong with his health.

648
00:31:12,346 --> 00:31:14,515
They took Woo Shik to a hospital...

649
00:31:14,516 --> 00:31:16,484
for an extensive checkup.

650
00:31:16,727 --> 00:31:18,656
- Thank you. - Sir,

651
00:31:18,657 --> 00:31:21,510
is there something wrong with Woo Shik's health?

652
00:31:21,526 --> 00:31:23,349
In my 30 years as a doctor,

653
00:31:24,127 --> 00:31:26,187
I've never seen nipples located so low.

654
00:31:26,296 --> 00:31:27,945
- Me neither. - They are...

655
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:30,476
located almost near the belly button.

656
00:31:30,907 --> 00:31:32,998
This is a very rare case, even worldwide.

657
00:31:33,506 --> 00:31:35,391
However, the results showed us...

658
00:31:35,877 --> 00:31:38,730
that there is nothing wrong with his health.

659
00:31:38,746 --> 00:31:41,765
Is there a way he can relocate his nipples?

660
00:31:41,846 --> 00:31:46,039
Well... There is a way where he can get them transplanted.

661
00:31:47,857 --> 00:31:50,886
Woo Shik, will you get them transplanted?

662
00:31:50,887 --> 00:31:52,019
No.

663
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:55,124
I like myself the way I am.

664
00:31:56,296 --> 00:31:57,896
I have no intention of receiving surgery.

665
00:31:57,897 --> 00:32:01,265
Woo Shik refused to receive a transplant until the end.

666
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:05,410
He's even a man who loves his own insecurity.

667
00:32:05,566 --> 00:32:08,419
We hope you never change!

668
00:32:08,707 --> 00:32:10,845
Good luck, Goatman of Huam-dong!

669
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:11,946
Thank you!

670
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,729
- Thank you! - Thank you!

671
00:32:19,286 --> 00:32:21,481
Woo Shik, thanks to your nipples...

672
00:32:21,657 --> 00:32:23,585
I mean, thanks to you,

673
00:32:23,586 --> 00:32:26,161
we really succeeded in promoting our guesthouse.

674
00:32:26,496 --> 00:32:28,126
Okay, so stop it and sit down.

675
00:32:28,127 --> 00:32:29,966
While we're at it,

676
00:32:29,967 --> 00:32:31,677
shouldn't we change the name of our guest house?

677
00:32:31,697 --> 00:32:32,860
To what?

678
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,666
How about this?

679
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:37,344
"Goatkiki Guesthouse".

680
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:43,376
- Die! Die! - Woo Shik.

681
00:32:43,377 --> 00:32:44,976
Woo Shik, don't do this.

682
00:32:44,977 --> 00:32:46,007
Stop.

683
00:32:47,746 --> 00:32:49,394
Where is the goatman?

684
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:52,261
- Hello. - Have a good time.

685
00:32:53,857 --> 00:32:55,315
How long has it been since we've had guests?

686
00:32:55,316 --> 00:32:58,448
This is the power of a TV appearance.

687
00:32:59,256 --> 00:33:01,079
Guys, check this out.

688
00:33:01,197 --> 00:33:02,795
The Goatman of Huam-dong...

689
00:33:02,796 --> 00:33:04,414
is still number one on the trending topic chart.

690
00:33:04,427 --> 00:33:05,726
Number two is the tranquilized bear girl.

691
00:33:05,727 --> 00:33:06,797
Let me see it too.

692
00:33:07,336 --> 00:33:10,221
After becoming the talk of the town with my funny pronunciation,

693
00:33:10,306 --> 00:33:12,805
I never imagined my friends would become...

694
00:33:12,806 --> 00:33:15,350
number 1 and 2 at the same time.

695
00:33:15,637 --> 00:33:17,676
Things are suddenly going so well for us.

696
00:33:17,677 --> 00:33:19,676
- We have another guest. - Welcome.

697
00:33:19,677 --> 00:33:21,275
- Hi. - Reservation?

698
00:33:21,276 --> 00:33:22,616
- Yes. - Name?

699
00:33:22,617 --> 00:33:23,956
- It's under Phillip. - Phillip.

700
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,796
- Phillip? Okay, Phillip. - Hello.

701
00:33:27,657 --> 00:33:31,293
Sorry, but where did they go? The...

702
00:33:32,826 --> 00:33:34,062
Okay, wait a minute.

703
00:33:34,857 --> 00:33:36,885
Hey, he came to see you two.

704
00:33:36,967 --> 00:33:38,095
Get ready!

705
00:33:38,096 --> 00:33:39,920
Phillip, give me your bag.

706
00:33:46,677 --> 00:33:47,944
- Hello. - Hi.

707
00:33:48,607 --> 00:33:50,152
- Hi. - Hi.

708
00:33:52,046 --> 00:33:53,973
You guys look great.

709
00:33:54,177 --> 00:33:56,617
It's like looking at the blue dragon and white tiger...

710
00:33:56,846 --> 00:33:57,916
No.

711
00:33:57,917 --> 00:34:00,430
Shall I say, the bear on the left and goat on the right?

712
00:34:00,486 --> 00:34:02,413
- Shut it. - Just take the picture.

713
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:04,240
All right.

714
00:34:04,427 --> 00:34:07,754
But looking at you two right now, you look perfect together.

715
00:34:07,927 --> 00:34:09,090
You're like a married couple.

716
00:34:09,196 --> 00:34:10,765
- Are you mad? - I told you to be quiet.

717
00:34:10,766 --> 00:34:12,239
All right.

718
00:34:12,496 --> 00:34:13,980
Get ready then.

719
00:34:14,266 --> 00:34:16,606
All right, say cheese!

720
00:34:16,607 --> 00:34:17,637
Wait.

721
00:34:20,136 --> 00:34:22,371
- Say goat! - Smile.

722
00:34:23,377 --> 00:34:25,745
- Goat. - Goat.

723
00:34:27,246 --> 00:34:30,202
(With the Goatman of Huam-dong and tranquilized bear girl)

724

Please visit us now!

729
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:49,047
Jung Eun, it's so cold. Can we take a short break?

730
00:34:49,067 --> 00:34:50,375
- Shall we? - Yes.

731
00:34:50,466 --> 00:34:51,600
Let's go.

732
00:34:55,076 --> 00:34:56,621
- It feels warm. - Yes.

733
00:34:57,977 --> 00:34:58,650
Hey.

734
00:34:59,774 --> 00:35:00,934
What are you two doing?

735
00:35:01,676 --> 00:35:03,808
It was so cold, and we're taking a short break.

736
00:35:03,886 --> 00:35:06,595
Who told you to take a break? Did I pay you to rest?

737
00:35:06,716 --> 00:35:08,285
- Sorry, sir. - Sorry, sir.

738
00:35:08,286 --> 00:35:10,419
What are you doing? Get back to work.

739
00:35:10,556 --> 00:35:12,719
- Okay. - You better not slack off.

740
00:35:12,857 --> 00:35:13,958
I'm sorry.

741
00:35:14,926 --> 00:35:17,226
Goodness, he's so mean. It hasn't even been a minute.

742
00:35:17,227 --> 00:35:19,152
Let's get back to work before he throws a fit.

743
00:35:19,596 --> 00:35:20,729
Okay.

744
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:26,706
This is the cheapest place in Korea.

745
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:29,250
We're also giving out many gifts.

746
00:35:29,906 --> 00:35:31,081
Come visit us.

747
00:35:32,806 --> 00:35:34,945
Doesn't it seem less cold suddenly?

748
00:35:34,946 --> 00:35:36,080
I guess.

749
00:35:36,147 --> 00:35:38,175
My butt feels especially warm.

750
00:35:39,587 --> 00:35:41,780
Don't you smell something burning?

751
00:35:44,426 --> 00:35:45,986
Soo Yeon, your tail is on fire.

752
00:35:45,987 --> 00:35:47,366
- What? - It's on fire.

753
00:35:47,527 --> 00:35:48,555
What on earth?

754
00:35:48,556 --> 00:35:51,450
- What is this? - Hold on, I'll put it out.

755
00:35:51,897 --> 00:35:53,307
Do something.

756
00:35:56,096 --> 00:35:57,166
Stop!

757
00:35:57,167 --> 00:36:00,266
(The World That They Live In)

758
00:36:00,477 --> 00:36:02,186
Mr. Goat, take a picture with me please.

759
00:36:02,877 --> 00:36:05,174
Thank you. 1, 2.

760
00:36:06,246 --> 00:36:07,719
Nice!

761
00:36:07,746 --> 00:36:09,816
Thank you very much. Cheer up, Mr. Goat!

762
00:36:09,817 --> 00:36:11,289
- Thank you. - Thank you.

763
00:36:12,616 --> 00:36:14,821
- Look at you working so hard. - Hey!

764
00:36:14,987 --> 00:36:16,726
How much longer do I have to do this?

765
00:36:16,727 --> 00:36:17,825
What do you think?

766
00:36:17,826 --> 00:36:20,456
You have to keep doing it until your nipples go up.

767
00:36:20,457 --> 00:36:21,487
- Gosh, seriously. - Guys.

768
00:36:22,826 --> 00:36:24,856
Shouldn't we have a party to celebrate our success?

769
00:36:24,966 --> 00:36:26,026
Pork belly party.

770
00:36:26,027 --> 00:36:27,666
Pork belly, my foot.

771
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:30,135
Hey, we still have a long way to go until we make up for our losses.

772
00:36:30,136 --> 00:36:31,465
Then we'll eat pork skin instead.

773
00:36:31,466 --> 00:36:33,156
It's cheap, delicious, and good for your skin.

774
00:36:33,337 --> 00:36:36,190
Pork skin is loaded with cholera.

775
00:36:36,607 --> 00:36:37,745
- "Cholera"? - Yes.

776
00:36:37,746 --> 00:36:39,006
Don't you know what "cholera" is?

777
00:36:39,007 --> 00:36:40,459
It's used in many skincare products.

778
00:36:40,846 --> 00:36:43,494
Jun Ki, you know that pork skin is high in cholera, right?

779
00:36:43,547 --> 00:36:45,615
You idiot. Do you mean, collagen?

780
00:36:45,616 --> 00:36:47,586
Cholera is an infectious disease.

781
00:36:47,587 --> 00:36:51,055
No, you're wrong. The owner of the pork skin restaurant told me.

782
00:36:51,056 --> 00:36:52,118
It is cholera!

783
00:36:52,386 --> 00:36:55,756
All right, fine. Eat a lot of cholera and get glowing skin.

784
00:36:55,757 --> 00:36:56,931
I'm back.

785
00:36:57,627 --> 00:36:58,935
Hey, you're back.

786
00:36:59,326 --> 00:37:00,535
It's freezing outside, isn't it?

787
00:37:00,536 --> 00:37:01,835
Don't even get me started.

788
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:05,865
We had to stand outside all day in short skirts.

789
00:37:05,866 --> 00:37:07,135
We're frozen right now.

790
00:37:07,136 --> 00:37:09,336
Gosh, I thought we were going to freeze to death.

791
00:37:09,337 --> 00:37:11,876
I thought you two would quit, but you're working so hard.

792
00:37:11,877 --> 00:37:13,463
You told me I shouldn't quit.

793
00:37:15,176 --> 00:37:17,206
But I must say, it's so hard to earn a living.

794
00:37:17,587 --> 00:37:19,502
Gosh, it got on my face. It's all over my face now.

795
00:37:20,087 --> 00:37:23,186
You're so gross. Can you at least cover your mouth?

796
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:26,245
I'm sorry. Gosh, I've been having the chills.

797
00:37:26,457 --> 00:37:28,280
- I guess I've caught a cold. - You have a cold?

798
00:37:29,297 --> 00:37:31,626
Go away. Go away, cold virus.

799
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:34,995
No, the gas mask. My gas mask. I must go get it.

800
00:37:34,996 --> 00:37:36,067
My gas mask!

801
00:37:36,466 --> 00:37:37,703
I'm going to have another bowl.

802
00:37:43,576 --> 00:37:44,646
Why do you keep yawning?

803
00:37:44,647 --> 00:37:47,075
I filled in for Jung Eun and worked as a chauffeur last night.

804
00:37:47,076 --> 00:37:48,724
- As a chauffeur? - Yes.

805
00:37:49,516 --> 00:37:52,316
I had to drive all the way to Chungcheong Province and back.

806
00:37:52,317 --> 00:37:53,347
Chungcheong Province?

807
00:37:53,487 --> 00:37:56,186
Goodness, look at you caring for your college alumna.

808
00:37:56,187 --> 00:37:58,730
Hey, she's just a burden.

809
00:37:58,957 --> 00:38:00,574
She's the bane of my existence.

810
00:38:01,926 --> 00:38:03,131
Why did you hit me?

811
00:38:03,266 --> 00:38:05,396
What? I'm a burden? The bane of your existence?

812
00:38:05,397 --> 00:38:06,495
You piece of...

813
00:38:06,496 --> 00:38:09,495
Don't you dare hit me. I'm going to sue you if you hit me again.

814
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:12,436
- You little... - I'm unwell, so I'll let it slide.

815
00:38:12,437 --> 00:38:14,836
Are you still feeling sick? Gosh, you don't look well.

816
00:38:14,837 --> 00:38:18,305
I'm not feeling well, but Soo Yeon had a fever all night. I'm worried.

817
00:38:18,306 --> 00:38:20,646
Really? Hey, shouldn't you go see a doctor?

818
00:38:20,647 --> 00:38:22,146
No, I don't have time for that.

819
00:38:22,147 --> 00:38:23,586
We have another event.

820
00:38:23,587 --> 00:38:26,186
What? You're going to work even though you're feeling sick?

821
00:38:26,187 --> 00:38:28,785
We have to. If we call in sick now,

822
00:38:28,786 --> 00:38:30,586
they won't hire us for other events.

823
00:38:30,587 --> 00:38:33,645
Hey, I'll just fill in for you.

824
00:38:33,996 --> 00:38:35,264
You should go see a doctor.

825
00:38:35,727 --> 00:38:37,896
You'll work at a promotional event?

826
00:38:37,897 --> 00:38:39,822
A promotional event? Sure, why not?

827
00:38:39,966 --> 00:38:41,566
Hey, I'm a good dancer.

828
00:38:41,567 --> 00:38:43,365
I'm also very persuasive. You know that.

829
00:38:43,366 --> 00:38:45,265
Still, I'm not sure how I feel about it.

830
00:38:45,266 --> 00:38:46,606
Don't worry. I can do it.

831
00:38:46,607 --> 00:38:48,175
Then what about Soo Yeon?

832
00:38:48,176 --> 00:38:49,238
What?

833
00:38:49,877 --> 00:38:52,071
Well, I'll fill in for her.

834
00:38:53,157 --> 00:38:55,278
- What? - Woo Shik, you'll fill in for me?

835
00:38:55,946 --> 00:38:57,885
- Why? - Because if you faint again,

836
00:38:57,886 --> 00:38:59,360
we'll end up spending more money.

837
00:38:59,786 --> 00:39:03,316
I must say, you're such a troublemaker.

838
00:39:03,317 --> 00:39:04,686
Hey, just forget it.

839
00:39:04,687 --> 00:39:06,285
I'll do it even if I end up fainting.

840
00:39:06,286 --> 00:39:07,801
Forget it. Just go see a doctor.

841
00:39:08,326 --> 00:39:09,531
- Let's go, Jun Ki. - All right.

842
00:39:10,227 --> 00:39:11,503
Go see a doctor right away.

843
00:39:13,897 --> 00:39:16,337
Guys, wait up! I'm going to my training.

844
00:39:16,837 --> 00:39:18,042
- Bye. - See you.

845
00:39:18,507 --> 00:39:19,670
Guys, wait up!

846
00:39:20,337 --> 00:39:21,882
Are they really going to be okay?

847
00:39:22,406 --> 00:39:23,581
I'm worried too.

848
00:39:31,987 --> 00:39:33,017
Hey, kiddo.

849
00:39:34,016 --> 00:39:35,856
Why are you hitting the tree with the ball?

850
00:39:35,857 --> 00:39:37,456
It's none of your business.

851
00:39:37,457 --> 00:39:40,356
Hey, this tree is a living thing just like you.

852
00:39:40,357 --> 00:39:44,226
You're hurting the tree with the ball.

853
00:39:44,227 --> 00:39:46,226
Whatever. You're so annoying.

854
00:39:46,227 --> 00:39:47,267
What?

855
00:39:48,196 --> 00:39:50,431
You little brat. How rude!

856
00:39:53,406 --> 00:39:55,436
Hey, are you seriously crying right now?

857
00:39:56,076 --> 00:39:57,241
That was just a gentle nudge.

858
00:39:57,746 --> 00:39:59,376
Hey, stop crying, okay?

859
00:39:59,377 --> 00:40:00,922
- Daddy! - "Daddy"?

860
00:40:02,377 --> 00:40:04,816
I'm sorry, okay? Stop crying. Please?

861
00:40:04,817 --> 00:40:06,715
- Daddy! - Darn it.

862
00:40:06,716 --> 00:40:07,818
This is crazy.

863
00:40:07,917 --> 00:40:10,223
Stop crying. I'm sorry, okay?

864
00:40:15,397 --> 00:40:19,226
So you two are here to fill in for Jung Eun and Soo Yeon today?

865
00:40:19,227 --> 00:40:22,495
Yes. Both of them came down with a bad cold.

866
00:40:22,496 --> 00:40:24,463
Then, they should've at least called me.

867
00:40:25,306 --> 00:40:26,936
I've already assigned them to an event.

868
00:40:26,937 --> 00:40:28,276
You can give us any job.

869
00:40:28,277 --> 00:40:30,206
We'll do a great job regardless of what it is.

870
00:40:30,207 --> 00:40:32,575
This specific job isn't really right for you guys.

871
00:40:32,576 --> 00:40:34,146
Don't worry.

872
00:40:34,147 --> 00:40:37,146
Unlike how we come across, we've actually been through a lot.

873
00:40:37,147 --> 00:40:38,763
- Yes. - We can do anything.

874
00:40:40,257 --> 00:40:41,317
We got this!

875
00:40:41,687 --> 00:40:43,407
By the way, what's this job?

876
00:40:43,656 --> 00:40:45,356
(All-natural organic cotton air-fit cushion to keep you dry)

877
00:40:45,357 --> 00:40:46,870
(Twin Angel, Double Wings)

878
00:40:49,957 --> 00:40:51,130
(Ultra Flower, Absorbs 5 times better)

879
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,514
(Sanitary Pads)

880
00:40:57,437 --> 00:41:00,135
Hey, Woo Shik. This is wrong, don't you think?

881
00:41:00,136 --> 00:41:02,752
I know. But we can't really back out now.

882
00:41:03,076 --> 00:41:05,517
- What do we do? - We should just do it.

883
00:41:06,707 --> 00:41:10,115
Commercials for feminine products use male models these days.

884
00:41:10,346 --> 00:41:13,555
There's nothing wrong with men selling pads, don't you think?

885
00:41:13,556 --> 00:41:17,059
That's true, but how are we going to sell these when we know nothing?

886
00:41:17,926 --> 00:41:21,048
She gave us the sales pitch earlier, you know.

887
00:41:21,156 --> 00:41:22,876
We'd just have to read this.

888
00:41:22,957 --> 00:41:24,852
I've already read this a few times,

889
00:41:24,966 --> 00:41:26,955
but I still don't understand a thing.

890
00:41:28,996 --> 00:41:31,200
Hey, by the way,

891
00:41:31,937 --> 00:41:33,066
what do they mean by "wings"?

892
00:41:33,067 --> 00:41:34,635
- "Wings"? - I mean,

893
00:41:34,636 --> 00:41:36,222
why would these have wings?

894
00:41:36,607 --> 00:41:40,180
Hey. Apparently, Ultra Flower has charcoal.

895
00:41:40,616 --> 00:41:42,018
But why are these white?

896
00:41:42,777 --> 00:41:45,586
How can they be white if they have charcoal? Shouldn't they be black?

897
00:41:45,587 --> 00:41:47,385
Gosh, what a mystery.

898
00:41:47,386 --> 00:41:50,136
Gosh, whatever. I have no idea what this means,

899
00:41:51,386 --> 00:41:52,457
but shall we get started?

900
00:41:52,826 --> 00:41:53,959
Okay, let's start.

901
00:41:59,596 --> 00:42:01,934
What? Why is everyone so early?

902
00:42:02,696 --> 00:42:04,313
And why is everyone shouting?

903
00:42:05,667 --> 00:42:07,562
- Hey, what is going on today? - There!

904
00:42:07,877 --> 00:42:09,175
Haven't you heard the news?

905
00:42:09,176 --> 00:42:10,484
Word has it that...

906
00:42:11,777 --> 00:42:14,015
they'll announce who's getting kicked out before the season starts.

907
00:42:14,016 --> 00:42:15,798
- Some will get kicked out? - That's why...

908
00:42:17,587 --> 00:42:20,645
everyone is trying so hard to win the coach's favor.

909
00:42:22,286 --> 00:42:23,697
You should be careful too.

910
00:42:24,826 --> 00:42:26,166
Don't get on the wrong side of him.

911
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:27,687
Oh, okay.

912
00:42:28,857 --> 00:42:31,503
Some are getting kicked out? I'd better not be one of them.

913
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:32,727
What do I do?

914
00:42:34,437 --> 00:42:35,467
Darn it.

915
00:42:43,676 --> 00:42:46,106
Look at you, Kook Ki Bong. Nice!

916
00:42:46,107 --> 00:42:47,515
You're full of enthusiasm.

917
00:42:47,516 --> 00:42:49,175
Thank you, Coach!

918
00:42:49,176 --> 00:42:50,588
- Keep it up! - Coach!

919
00:42:51,016 --> 00:42:52,222
- Coach. - Yes.

920
00:42:52,616 --> 00:42:54,851
Coach, Dong Hyun is here.

921
00:42:54,886 --> 00:42:55,916
Really?

922
00:42:57,386 --> 00:42:58,664
Hey!

923
00:42:58,957 --> 00:43:00,155
Who is Dong Hyun?

924
00:43:00,156 --> 00:43:01,805
He's Coach's son.

925
00:43:03,326 --> 00:43:04,871
He adores him so much.

926
00:43:04,966 --> 00:43:07,635
He'd do anything for his son!

927
00:43:07,636 --> 00:43:09,140
Oh, I see.

928
00:43:09,297 --> 00:43:13,941
Daddy! Daddy!

929
00:43:17,076 --> 00:43:18,175
My pumpkin, what happened?

930
00:43:18,176 --> 00:43:20,646
A man hit me.

931
00:43:20,647 --> 00:43:21,707
What?

932
00:43:22,377 --> 00:43:26,125
Who did it? Who's the jerk that hit my son?

933
00:43:28,516 --> 00:43:29,856
You remember his face, right?

934
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,536
- Yes. - Then let's go find him.

935
00:43:31,656 --> 00:43:33,274
This scumbag.

936
00:43:33,386 --> 00:43:35,526
I'm going to kill him!

937
00:43:35,527 --> 00:43:37,453
Let's go. My goodness.

938
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:40,836
- Who dared to hit my son? - Darn it.

939
00:43:40,837 --> 00:43:43,205
I'm in big trouble. What should I do?

940
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:44,702
Gosh, what do I do?

941
00:43:46,007 --> 00:43:47,211
Darn it.

942
00:43:56,071 --> 00:43:58,789
Dong Hyun, it's me. Don't worry.

943
00:43:59,071 --> 00:44:01,510
I just want to have a quick talk with you.

944
00:44:01,511 --> 00:44:03,776
I'll uncover your mouth, but you can't scream, okay?

945
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:06,979
- Daddy! - Gosh!

946
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,421
Hey, you promised you wouldn't scream!

947
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:12,690
Hear me out first, please?

948
00:44:13,191 --> 00:44:15,013
- Gosh, what is it? - Well...

949
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,760
I'm sorry about earlier.

950
00:44:19,761 --> 00:44:21,329
I'm really sorry, okay?

951
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:23,059
I sincerely apologize for what happened.

952
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:27,800
So can you not tell your dad... I mean, can you not tell my coach?

953
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:30,169
- Why can't I tell him? - If you tell him,

954
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,287
I may get kicked out.

955
00:44:33,341 --> 00:44:35,780
So let it slide just this once. Please?

956
00:44:35,781 --> 00:44:37,209
Just this once.

957
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:39,888
Okay. But you'll have to do me a favor in exchange.

958
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,210
A favor?

959
00:44:41,951 --> 00:44:44,720
So all I have to do is lend you my phone?

960
00:44:44,721 --> 00:44:45,990
I can install a game app, right?

961
00:44:45,991 --> 00:44:47,760
My dad doesn't let me play games.

962
00:44:47,761 --> 00:44:50,320
Yes, of course. Go ahead and install it.

963
00:44:50,321 --> 00:44:51,907
Feel free to buy items and so on.

964
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:56,552
But you have to promise me that you won't tell your dad.

965
00:44:56,761 --> 00:44:58,315
That will depend on how you behave.

966
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:03,218
All right, I'll be good to you. I'll treat you very well.

967
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:06,743
Then I'll get back to my training.

968
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,675
Mister.

969
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,650
Let me know when my dad is coming here,

970
00:45:11,651 --> 00:45:12,783
okay?

971
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,450
Okay. You can count on me, Dong Hyun.

972
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:18,482
Have fun.

973
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:30,570
- Twin Angel... - Ultra Flower... It's new.

974
00:45:30,571 --> 00:45:32,558
It has two wings. It's nice.

975
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,734
It absorbs five times as much.

976
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:35,842
It's a new product.

977
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:37,606
It's on sale.

978
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:39,414
What are you doing right now?

979
00:45:41,381 --> 00:45:42,441
Ma'am.

980
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,878
Do you think you can sell everything you're assigned today that way?

981
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:49,780
Do you have any idea how competitive this spot is?

982
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:51,019
- Sorry. - Sorry.

983
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:53,590
Forget it. The person who sells less today...

984
00:45:53,591 --> 00:45:55,690
will be replaced. Understood?

985
00:45:55,691 --> 00:45:56,920
What do you mean?

986
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:59,059
If I don't sell enough, will Soo Yeon be fired?

987
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:00,959
- Of course. - I guess Jung Eun is safe.

988
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,959
If you don't sell enough,

989
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,659
- Jung Eun will be fired. - What?

990
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,628
- Do you understand? - Yes.

991
00:46:06,131 --> 00:46:08,840
Gosh, I can't believe her.

992
00:46:08,841 --> 00:46:11,796
I know. She's making us compete.

993
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:14,828
This is bad.

994
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:17,345
I don't want Jung Eun to get fired because of me.

995
00:46:17,551 --> 00:46:18,921
This is not good.

996
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:21,238
I don't want Soo Yeon to get fired because of me.

997
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:26,630
I guess we have no choice.

998
00:46:27,361 --> 00:46:29,008
We'll have to do our best.

999
00:46:29,091 --> 00:46:31,707
Well, I guess.

1000
00:46:34,131 --> 00:46:35,439
Ultra Flower.

1001
00:46:35,631 --> 00:46:37,381
It's not my name, but my buddy's.

1002
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:41,539
This absorbs twice as much as the other products? No.

1003
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,529
Three times? No.

1004
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,186
Five times.

1005
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:46,440
Look.

1006
00:46:46,441 --> 00:46:47,880
Just a second, pretty ladies.

1007
00:46:47,881 --> 00:46:49,340
This is our new product, Twin Angel.

1008
00:46:49,341 --> 00:46:50,979
It has two wings.

1009
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,216
Not just 1, but 2.

1010
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:55,588
Once you put it on, you'll realize that it doesn't show at all.

1011
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:56,712
I'll take it.

1012
00:46:57,350 --> 00:47:00,090
Let me tell you about Ultra Flower.

1013
00:47:00,091 --> 00:47:02,789
In addition to being able to absorb five times as much,

1014
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:04,360
it contains natural charcoal.

1015
00:47:04,361 --> 00:47:07,999
Also, it was dermatologically tested in Germany...

1016
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,092
and obtained the Excellent Grade.

1017
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:13,099
Made with 100 percent organic cotton,

1018
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,953
it will protect...

1019
00:47:16,071 --> 00:47:17,639
your daily life.

1020
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:21,510
In addition to having two wings,

1021
00:47:21,511 --> 00:47:23,539
Twin Angel has organic cotton cushions.

1022
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,280
It will never irritate your skin...

1023
00:47:25,281 --> 00:47:27,179
and keep your skin fresh.

1024
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:29,650
No coloring, pesticides, bleach,

1025
00:47:29,651 --> 00:47:31,320
or superabsorbent polymers.

1026
00:47:31,321 --> 00:47:34,159
It will always protect your health.

1027
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,920
Come. It's Twin Angel.

1028
00:47:36,921 --> 00:47:39,917
Well... Ultra Flower...

I'm sorry I can't be honest

1057
00:49:11,591 --> 00:49:13,320
I'm sorry I wasn't being honest.

1058
00:49:13,321 --> 00:49:15,920
It's Angel's treat today.

1059
00:49:15,921 --> 00:49:16,990
What is it now?

1060
00:49:16,991 --> 00:49:19,844

Dong Hyun, eat a lot.

1066
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,829
Gosh, what's wrong?

1067
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:53,849
Lower your voice.

1068
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,842
Is my dad watching us?

1069
00:50:00,471 --> 00:50:02,664
- No. - I have a favor to ask.

1070
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,110
Can you eat my kimchi?

1071
00:50:12,951 --> 00:50:15,422
- What? - I don't like kimchi.

1072
00:50:15,451 --> 00:50:17,336
In addition, spinach, bean sprouts...

1073
00:50:17,491 --> 00:50:18,583
I hate all of them.

1074
00:50:18,651 --> 00:50:19,959
So you want me...

1075
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,119
to eat your kimchi and vegetables?

1076
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,665
Dad is going to check later.

1077
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,878
What? You don't want to?

1078
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:30,327
That's not it. I'll eat them.

1079
00:50:34,671 --> 00:50:36,869
- What are you doing? - What?

1080
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:39,795
If you take everything at once, Dad will suspect.

1081
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:42,818
Take a little every time you eat rice.

1082
00:50:43,011 --> 00:50:44,185
Okay?

1083
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:46,484
Okay.

1084
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:57,073
Are you happy now?

1085
00:50:57,191 --> 00:50:58,911
Yes. Good job.

1086
00:50:59,131 --> 00:51:00,676
Excuse me now.

1087
00:51:05,801 --> 00:51:07,521
Dad, I'm finished.

1088
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:11,337
Dong Hyun, you're better than me.

1089
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:13,074
Return the tray.

1090
00:51:13,841 --> 00:51:15,324
What is this?

1091
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:20,079
Meet me at the coach office in 10 minutes.

1092
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,728
Where did he learn this?

1093
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,920
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1094
00:51:28,591 --> 00:51:29,755
Darn.

1095
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,530
Thank you for waiting.

1096
00:51:34,531 --> 00:51:37,867
If you buy Ultra Flower,

1097
00:51:37,901 --> 00:51:39,970
you get one more for free.

1098
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:41,740
You also get chewy...

1099
00:51:41,741 --> 00:51:43,966
and garlic-flavored sausages.

1100
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,583
Ultra Flower's dinner idea.

1101
00:51:47,011 --> 00:51:48,967
It was salted by a Living National Treasure.

1102
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:53,203
Andong mackerel.

1103
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:55,239
Is that all?

1104
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:59,503
Mr. Angel gives a lot more.

1105
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:01,470
Is it better than mackerel?

1106
00:52:01,591 --> 00:52:04,329
If you buy Twin Angel,

1107
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:06,247
you get one more...

1108
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:09,653
and one box of...

1109
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:12,570
20-year-old ginseng extract for free.

1110
00:52:12,571 --> 00:52:14,836
- I want one. - Thank you.

1111
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:17,930
- Thank you. - Give me one.

1112
00:52:18,071 --> 00:52:20,979
- Unbelievable. - Thank you.

1113
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,865
Thank you.

1114
00:52:23,241 --> 00:52:25,050
Come here.

1115
00:52:25,051 --> 00:52:26,286
Don't you think this is too much?

1116
00:52:26,451 --> 00:52:29,349
- What do you mean? - This is completely unnecessary.

1117
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:31,040
We'll have to pay for these things out of our own pockets.

1118
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:33,389
It'll kill both of us.

1119
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:34,761
Who started this?

1120
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,050
Hey, what's this all about?

1121
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:39,835
Are you afraid Soo Yeon will get fired?

1122
00:52:39,991 --> 00:52:42,503
Or is it because...

1123
00:52:43,031 --> 00:52:44,647
you like her?

1124
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:47,800
- That's not it. - Then what is it?

1125
00:52:47,801 --> 00:52:50,520
Soo Yeon is broke, and her marriage was canceled.

1126
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,809
Still, she's trying to get back on her feet.

1127
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:54,387
She'll be devastated if she gets fired again.

1128
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,039
- Don't you feel sorry for her? - Jung Eun is the same.

1129
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,409
She put herself through college,

1130
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:00,790
but her acting career is going nowhere.

1131
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:03,150
She works at several different places a day.

1132
00:53:03,151 --> 00:53:06,050
She even works as a chauffeur at night.

1133
00:53:06,051 --> 00:53:07,256
Don't you feel sorry for her?

1134
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,798
You give up.

1135
00:53:10,361 --> 00:53:11,699
I can't.

1136
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,838
Are you serious?

1137
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:17,943
Do you really want to see the end?

1138
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,603
Fine, deal.

1139
00:53:21,171 --> 00:53:22,747
Do whatever you want.

1140
00:53:22,801 --> 00:53:23,934
Wait and see.

1141
00:53:31,445 --> 00:53:33,331
What is it? What do you want?

1142
00:53:35,416 --> 00:53:37,166
Do my homework for me.

1143
00:53:39,515 --> 00:53:41,338
What is this?

1144
00:53:43,756 --> 00:53:46,124
"Elementary Math for Higher IQ".

1145
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:48,285
My dad is going to check later.

1146
00:53:48,495 --> 00:53:49,938
What? You don't want to?

1147
00:53:50,256 --> 00:53:51,398
What?

1148
00:53:52,425 --> 00:53:54,324
That's not it. Okay.

1149
00:53:54,325 --> 00:53:55,808
I'll do it.

1150
00:53:55,936 --> 00:53:59,778
If you finish this, I'll forget everything.

1151
00:54:00,035 --> 00:54:01,580
Okay, fine.

1152
00:54:01,936 --> 00:54:04,545
This is the last thing I'll do for you.

1153
00:54:04,546 --> 00:54:06,843
But make sure you shouldn't get anything wrong.

1154
00:54:06,945 --> 00:54:08,645
For each question I get wrong,

1155
00:54:08,646 --> 00:54:10,915
my dad said I can't watch a week of "Knowing Brothers".

1156
00:54:10,916 --> 00:54:13,284
"Knowing Brothers"? The variety show?

1157
00:54:13,285 --> 00:54:16,170
Yes. It's my favorite TV show.

1158
00:54:16,285 --> 00:54:19,455
So you must not get anything wrong. Okay?

1159
00:54:19,456 --> 00:54:21,691
Okay, I understand. I'll do it.

1160
00:54:28,336 --> 00:54:29,633
Hang in there a bit more.

1161
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,151
That little punk...

1162
00:54:37,606 --> 00:54:38,779
This is so annoying.

1163
00:54:40,245 --> 00:54:42,028
Darn it!

1164
00:54:42,615 --> 00:54:45,160
1 plus 6 is...

1165
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:00,625
What on earth am I doing?

1166
00:55:00,626 --> 00:55:03,417
I'm solving math problems for an elementary student.

1167
00:55:03,595 --> 00:55:05,078
What is this mess?

1168
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:11,947
Mister, get me some coke.

1169
00:55:12,106 --> 00:55:14,166
See you in 10 minutes at the same place.

1170
00:55:14,276 --> 00:55:15,821
Watch out for any tails.

1171
00:55:15,916 --> 00:55:17,545
This little punk.

1172
00:55:17,546 --> 00:55:20,502
He's even making me buy beverages for him now?

1173
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:24,767
I'd rather get kicked out of the team instead.

1174
00:55:24,856 --> 00:55:26,884
I can't take this anymore.

1175
00:55:27,285 --> 00:55:32,683
Kim Dong Hyun, I will destroy you.

1176
00:55:33,825 --> 00:55:35,795
How shall I get revenge?

1177
00:55:35,796 --> 00:55:37,722
(Elementary Math for Higher IQ)

1178
00:55:38,305 --> 00:55:39,850
That's how I'll do it.

1179
00:55:41,506 --> 00:55:42,566
Kim Dong Hyun.

1180
00:55:43,276 --> 00:55:45,264
You'll never watch "Knowing Brothers" ever again.

1181
00:55:46,745 --> 00:55:49,014
1 plus 1 equals cutie

1182
00:55:49,015 --> 00:55:51,796
2 plus 2 equals cutie

1183
00:55:51,845 --> 00:55:55,151
2 plus 2 equals, let's see, cutie

1184
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:57,788
4 plus 4 equals cutie

1185
00:55:58,586 --> 00:56:00,025
Buy Twin Angel.

1186
00:56:00,026 --> 00:56:02,625
If you buy now, you'll receive a box of ginseng extract...

1187
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:04,824
Wait, are you going to buy this?

1188
00:56:04,825 --> 00:56:06,411
I heard this includes carcinogenic substances.

1189
00:56:06,595 --> 00:56:09,726
Really? I can't believe I almost bought this.

1190
00:56:09,796 --> 00:56:11,515
- Let's go. - Wait a second.

1191
00:56:11,566 --> 00:56:14,205
Who said anything about carcinogenic substances?

1192
00:56:14,206 --> 00:56:16,131
The man selling Ultra Flower said that.

1193
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:19,174
- What? - Thank you for waiting for so long.

1194
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:22,875
Let's dance together. Put your hands up!

1195
00:56:22,876 --> 00:56:25,214
Get ready for the Ultra Flower clap.

1196
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,791
- Yes! - Begin!

1197
00:56:31,986 --> 00:56:35,125
Jun Ki. Did you say Twin Angel includes carcinogenic substances?

1198
00:56:35,126 --> 00:56:37,113
I'm not sure. I don't remember saying that.

1199
00:56:38,865 --> 00:56:41,472
Don't lie. The ladies told me.

1200
00:56:42,035 --> 00:56:44,198
Do you know you just spread false information?

1201
00:56:44,436 --> 00:56:46,464
This might lead to a legal issue later.

1202
00:56:46,465 --> 00:56:48,105
Why would I lie?

1203
00:56:48,106 --> 00:56:49,875
Even if I don't say something like that,

1204
00:56:49,876 --> 00:56:52,244
Ultra Flower is a much better product than yours.

1205
00:56:52,245 --> 00:56:53,275
Right?

1206
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:54,543
- Yes! - Yes!

1207
00:56:55,175 --> 00:56:57,315
Hey. Did you just disrespect Twin Angel?

1208
00:56:57,316 --> 00:56:58,985
You only have one wing.

1209
00:56:58,986 --> 00:57:01,045
Goodness, that darn wing of yours!

1210
00:57:01,046 --> 00:57:02,355
I'm sick and tired of wings.

1211
00:57:02,356 --> 00:57:04,185
What will you do with those wings?

1212
00:57:04,186 --> 00:57:06,455
Will you fly like a bird or what?

1213
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:09,340
Yours' absorbing power isn't even one-fifth of my Ultra Flower.

1214
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:11,025
Hey, how do you know that?

1215
00:57:11,026 --> 00:57:13,964
Do you have proof your product absorb better than mine?

1216
00:57:13,965 --> 00:57:15,464
Gosh, forget it.

1217
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:17,235
Comparing a low-quality product like this...

1218
00:57:17,236 --> 00:57:20,835
with Ultra Flower is just a shame.

1219
00:57:20,836 --> 00:57:21,907
Low-quality?

1220
00:57:22,476 --> 00:57:23,743
Hey, what did you say?

1221
00:57:24,675 --> 00:57:26,839
Hold on. An angel is being violent.

1222
00:57:27,646 --> 00:57:28,915
Did you just hit me?

1223
00:57:28,916 --> 00:57:32,418
Yes, I did. You have a problem with that, Ultra Flower?

1224
00:57:33,916 --> 00:57:36,769
You darn Twin Angel. I won't tolerate this anymore.

1225
00:57:39,486 --> 00:57:43,884
Hey! Angel and Flower have gotten into a fight!

1226
00:57:45,126 --> 00:57:47,844
Ultra Flower absorbs five times as much!

1227
00:57:49,166 --> 00:57:50,226
Oh my gosh.

1228
00:57:52,206 --> 00:57:54,904
Our product has two wings!

1229
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:57,924
I'm sick of hearing about those wings, seriously.

1230
00:57:58,376 --> 00:57:59,714
Somebody stop them.

1231
00:58:04,175 --> 00:58:07,585
Look at that little carefree punk.

1232
00:58:08,385 --> 00:58:10,240
He made me do all his homework.

1233
00:58:10,856 --> 00:58:13,461
And he's playing with a ball? But now...

1234
00:58:14,796 --> 00:58:18,369
You'll never get to watch "Knowing Brothers" ever again.

1235
00:58:22,595 --> 00:58:24,140
Dong Hyun.

1236
00:58:25,765 --> 00:58:28,074
You scared me. I thought you were Dad.

1237
00:58:28,075 --> 00:58:30,074
Come on, why are you so scared?

1238
00:58:30,075 --> 00:58:31,304
Can't the coach see you?

1239
00:58:31,305 --> 00:58:33,875
Dad doesn't want me to play baseball.

1240
00:58:33,876 --> 00:58:35,275
Why?

1241
00:58:35,276 --> 00:58:38,045
He doesn't want me to suffer all the training like him...

1242
00:58:38,046 --> 00:58:39,972
and wants me to focus on studying.

1243
00:58:40,285 --> 00:58:42,582
But I like baseball more than anything in this world.

1244
00:58:43,856 --> 00:58:45,685
You said you liked "Knowing Brothers" earlier.

1245
00:58:45,686 --> 00:58:48,477
That's my second favorite thing after baseball.

1246
00:58:48,956 --> 00:58:51,594
Is that why you always practice secretly all the time?

1247
00:58:51,595 --> 00:58:54,795
Yes. One day, I'll become a pitcher like Park Chan Ho...

1248
00:58:54,796 --> 00:58:57,545
and play in the Major League. You just wait and see.

1249
00:58:58,836 --> 00:58:59,937
Why are you smiling?

1250
00:59:01,836 --> 00:59:04,235
It's nothing. You just remind me of someone.

1251
00:59:04,236 --> 00:59:06,875
Did you finish solving the math problems? Show me.

1252
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:08,049
Oh, here.

1253
00:59:09,276 --> 00:59:10,862
(Elementary Math for Higher IQ)

1254
00:59:11,515 --> 00:59:12,714
Hold on.

1255
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:14,291
- Why? - Well...

1256
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:18,296
I forgot to do a final check.

1257
00:59:18,586 --> 00:59:20,202
I'll be back in no time,

1258
00:59:20,226 --> 00:59:22,494
so keep practicing. Have some coke too.

1259
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:24,094
Okay, you better hurry.

1260
00:59:24,095 --> 00:59:25,640
All right. Keep practicing.

1261
00:59:35,606 --> 00:59:38,799
Right. He's like me, dreaming of playing in the Major League.

1262
00:59:39,345 --> 00:59:40,541
I can't do this.

1263
00:59:41,976 --> 00:59:45,343
Kim Dong Hyun, I will...

1264
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:50,047
let you watch "Knowing Brothers".

1265
00:59:52,486 --> 00:59:54,824
The coach's son took advantage of you...

1266
00:59:54,825 --> 00:59:56,340
and you ate kimchi for him?

1267
00:59:56,356 --> 01:00:00,625
Yes, at first, I was thinking of getting revenge since I was so mad,

1268
01:00:00,626 --> 01:00:04,684
but that little kid was practicing baseball so hard on his own.

1269
01:00:04,765 --> 01:00:07,896
He was so confident that he'd play in the Major League one day.

1270
01:00:09,075 --> 01:00:10,930
He was just like me when I was young.

1271
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:14,844
So that's why I ate kimchi...

1272
01:00:14,845 --> 01:00:17,657
and solved all his math problems for him.

1273
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:20,968
You solved math problems? You did?

1274
01:00:21,316 --> 01:00:22,346
Why?

1275
01:00:25,026 --> 01:00:27,323
Do you think I had trouble solving those problems?

1276
01:00:27,586 --> 01:00:30,170
Hey, it was just adding and subtracting problems for kids.

1277
01:00:30,495 --> 01:00:32,453
Are you taking me for a fool?

1278
01:00:36,765 --> 01:00:38,795
Zero points? Something's wrong.

1279
01:00:38,905 --> 01:00:41,099
Ki Bong even rechecked for me.

1280
01:00:41,236 --> 01:00:44,017
Darn, is that guy really stupid or what?

1281
01:00:45,845 --> 01:00:49,450
He probably won't forget me for the rest of his life.

1282
01:00:50,015 --> 01:00:52,518
I'm like his savior. I truly am.

1283
01:00:55,655 --> 01:00:58,056
By the way, I wonder how the other two are doing.

1284
01:00:58,325 --> 01:00:59,973
It's not an easy job.

1285
01:01:00,055 --> 01:01:01,158
I know.

1286
01:01:03,195 --> 01:01:04,257
It's the manager.

1287
01:01:04,655 --> 01:01:05,726
Yes, ma'am?

1288
01:01:06,965 --> 01:01:08,026
What?

1289
01:01:09,535 --> 01:01:12,804
Are you guys insane? How could you fight there?

1290
01:01:12,805 --> 01:01:14,804
We both got fired because of you.

1291
01:01:14,805 --> 01:01:17,143
What will you do now? Say something!

1292
01:01:17,376 --> 01:01:18,477
Well...

1293
01:01:19,905 --> 01:01:22,114
He kept spreading false rumors that Twin Angel...

1294
01:01:22,115 --> 01:01:23,375
had carcinogenic substances in it.

1295
01:01:23,376 --> 01:01:25,444
You were the one who offered the box of free ginseng extract?

1296
01:01:25,445 --> 01:01:28,685
You were the one who gave out the sausages all of a sudden.

1297
01:01:28,686 --> 01:01:30,158
- Those darn wings! - Quiet!

1298
01:01:30,416 --> 01:01:31,692
What are you talking about?

1299
01:01:31,856 --> 01:01:33,455
What have you two done?

1300
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:36,411
Hey. We did all of this for you two.

1301
01:01:37,796 --> 01:01:40,299
We shouldn't have trusted you two in the first place.

1302
01:01:41,765 --> 01:01:44,372
Goodness, there's just nothing you can do properly.

1303
01:01:44,736 --> 01:01:45,899
You idiots.

1304
01:01:46,166 --> 01:01:47,576
What? Idiots?

1305
01:01:47,936 --> 01:01:50,274
Gosh, they're so harsh.

1306
01:01:50,336 --> 01:01:54,244
I guess this is why you shouldn't offer help to desperate people.

1307
01:01:54,245 --> 01:01:56,893
Tell me about it. I won't help you ever again.

1308
01:01:58,715 --> 01:01:59,817
I'm hungry.

1309
01:02:00,715 --> 01:02:02,435
Jun Ki, how about some ramyeon?

1310
01:02:02,486 --> 01:02:04,884
Sounds great. Angel, are you cooking it?

1311
01:02:04,885 --> 01:02:05,915
Sure.

1312
01:02:06,885 --> 01:02:08,654
- Woo Shik, me too. - Get lost.

1313
01:02:08,655 --> 01:02:09,726
Turn on the TV.

1314
01:02:12,126 --> 01:02:13,742
Gosh, that hurts.

1315
01:02:14,595 --> 01:02:16,388
I was being kind for nothing.

1316
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:22,370
I will never care for Han Soo Yeon ever again.

1317
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:24,808
Hey, Woo Shik.

1318
01:02:30,175 --> 01:02:31,412
What is it this time?

1319
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:34,382
Still, you went through a lot today because of me.

1320
01:02:36,316 --> 01:02:38,447
Why did you fight? Are you two kids or what?

1321
01:02:42,356 --> 01:02:44,282
Hey, what are you doing?

1322
01:02:44,595 --> 01:02:45,832
Stay still.

1323
01:03:26,706 --> 01:03:27,767
There.

1324
01:03:30,035 --> 01:03:31,209
What's wrong?

1325
01:03:34,276 --> 01:03:36,542
- Woo Shik. - What? Why?

1326
01:03:36,575 --> 01:03:38,543
Why are you gawking at me?

1327
01:03:40,046 --> 01:03:42,352
When? When did I gawk at you?

1328
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:44,722
That's ridiculous.

1329
01:03:48,595 --> 01:03:51,407
What's with him? I was just being nice.

1330
01:03:57,195 --> 01:03:58,297
Hello?

1331
01:03:59,666 --> 01:04:01,901
What? Who did you say you are?

1332
01:04:03,675 --> 01:04:04,705
What?

1333
01:04:05,245 --> 01:04:06,544
- My gosh! - What?

1334
01:04:08,075 --> 01:04:09,249
Hey, what's wrong?

1335
01:04:11,715 --> 01:04:12,849
Who was it?

1336
01:04:13,245 --> 01:04:15,964
My sister is on her way here.

1337
01:04:16,086 --> 01:04:17,185
What?

1338
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,318
Your sister is on her way here?

1339
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:21,544
Are you serious? Yu Ri is coming here?

1340
01:05:01,995 --> 01:05:04,468
(Welcome to Waikiki 2 / Eulachacha Waikiki 2)

1341
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:06,735
Even if my sister calls, do not answer.

1342
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,674
Don't talk to her. Don't even look at her, okay?

1343
01:05:08,675 --> 01:05:11,004
Have you lost your mind? Otherwise, how could you do this?

1344
01:05:11,075 --> 01:05:12,645
You have to leave before Woo Shik wakes up.

1345
01:05:12,646 --> 01:05:13,744
If you get caught, I'll be kicked out too.

1346
01:05:13,745 --> 01:05:15,375
I'm not leaving. I've had a change of heart.

1347
01:05:15,376 --> 01:05:16,514
Six legs?

1348
01:05:16,515 --> 01:05:17,545
Continue along.

1349
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:20,114
I still have feelings for her? But why?

1350
01:05:20,115 --> 01:05:21,908
Woo Shik! Are you feeling sick?

1351
01:05:23,186 --> 01:05:24,985
No!

1352
01:05:24,986 --> 01:05:26,284
What kind of role will it be?

1353
01:05:26,285 --> 01:05:28,108
Oh, it'll be the male lead's stand-in.

1354
01:05:28,155 --> 01:05:30,554
Why put up with all of that when your face won't even show?

1355
01:05:30,555 --> 01:05:33,686
I know I'm your stand-in, but this is too...

1356
01:05:34,425 --> 01:05:36,835
Let's have a blast, okay?
