(100 Real Dating Techniques)

2
00:00:11,356 --> 00:00:13,824
No. He can't fight like that.

3
00:00:13,825 --> 00:00:15,631
- Come on. - This is frustrating.

4
00:00:15,656 --> 00:00:18,264
He needs to use an armbar in that situation.

5
00:00:18,265 --> 00:00:20,643
No, he needs to take him down, do a full mount,

6
00:00:20,695 --> 00:00:22,135
and pound him like crazy.

7
00:00:22,136 --> 00:00:25,334
No, if he fails, he'll get stuck in a triangle choke right away.

8
00:00:25,335 --> 00:00:28,104
You guys are so noisy, and I can't read my book.

9
00:00:28,105 --> 00:00:30,905
I don't know what men find so entertaining about that.

10
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:33,105
What? Clashing, falling, rolling, ducking, and hitting.

11
00:00:33,106 --> 00:00:34,645
Do you know how fun that is?

12
00:00:34,646 --> 00:00:38,798
There's something about martial arts that makes men's blood boil.

13
00:00:40,856 --> 00:00:43,185
My goodness! Did you see that?

14
00:00:43,186 --> 00:00:44,890
Backspin elbow!

15
00:00:45,055 --> 00:00:47,594
I never imagined him using a backspin elbow.

16
00:00:47,595 --> 00:00:49,395
Backspin elbow? What is that?

17
00:00:49,396 --> 00:00:51,028
It's that right there.

18
00:00:51,165 --> 00:00:55,064
That's a very powerful move because of the spinning motion.

19
00:00:55,065 --> 00:00:57,076
Also, because it uses the elbow,

20
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:00,121
the opponent faints right away if he's hit by that move.

21
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,619
You even know martial arts techniques. Pretty impressive.

22
00:01:03,735 --> 00:01:05,990
Then you two are good at fighting, right?

23
00:01:07,175 --> 00:01:08,195
Fighting?

24
00:01:09,015 --> 00:01:12,107
Well, I'm not the kind of guy to get beaten up by anyone.

25
00:01:13,285 --> 00:01:16,055
I haven't lost in a fight to anyone my whole life either.

26
00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:20,269
Really? Then if you two fight, who will win?

27
00:01:20,285 --> 00:01:21,347
Us?

28
00:01:23,095 --> 00:01:25,208
I mean, I'm just curious.

29
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:27,995
But looking at your height and build,

30
00:01:27,996 --> 00:01:29,159
it's obvious Ki Bong will win.

31
00:01:29,595 --> 00:01:30,605
What?

32
00:01:30,606 --> 00:01:33,728
Hey, Jun Ki has a black belt in Taekwondo.

33
00:01:33,906 --> 00:01:35,905
Maybe Jun Ki will win.

34
00:01:35,906 --> 00:01:37,884
Come on, that's ridiculous.

35
00:01:37,946 --> 00:01:39,775
Ki Bong is much bigger than him.

36
00:01:39,776 --> 00:01:41,715
You never know until they actually fight.

37
00:01:41,716 --> 00:01:43,143
Stop it already.

38
00:01:43,276 --> 00:01:46,284
Come on, there's no winning or losing between friends.

39
00:01:46,285 --> 00:01:47,336
Goodness.

40
00:01:48,186 --> 00:01:51,784
But it's not like you fight using just your build.

41
00:01:51,785 --> 00:01:56,927
But you can't deny that physique is important in fights.

42
00:01:58,496 --> 00:02:03,636
(Crying Fist)

43
00:02:19,315 --> 00:02:20,917
I said, you weren't mistaken.

44
00:02:21,285 --> 00:02:23,092
You were my first love.

45
00:02:23,255 --> 00:02:25,194
Cha Woo Shik, you were my first love.

46
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:31,339
Stupid, stupid, stupid...

47
00:02:31,825 --> 00:02:35,029
Hey, brother. Can you please let me read my book?

48
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:37,194
It was me.

49
00:02:37,195 --> 00:02:38,767
You? About what?

50
00:02:38,806 --> 00:02:42,202
Soo Yeon said that her first love...

51
00:02:42,605 --> 00:02:43,835
was me.

52
00:02:43,836 --> 00:02:45,406
What? Really?

53
00:02:47,516 --> 00:02:48,536
Are you serious?

54
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,985
Yes. But I was mistaken...

55
00:02:51,986 --> 00:02:54,098
and acted like a fool for 10 years.

56
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:56,115
If it weren't for that misunderstanding,

57
00:02:56,116 --> 00:02:59,824
I would've dated Soo Yeon happily...

58
00:02:59,825 --> 00:03:01,794
and gotten married.

59
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:06,142
By now, we'll probably have a son and a daughter...

60
00:03:06,195 --> 00:03:09,335
and lived like a happy family.

61
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:12,935
My goodness. You made plans to get married...

62
00:03:12,936 --> 00:03:15,384
and have kids with her on your own?

63
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:18,074
Then why don't you give it another shot now?

64
00:03:18,075 --> 00:03:19,473
How could I do that?

65
00:03:19,945 --> 00:03:22,844
Soo Yeon doesn't seem interested in me at all now.

66
00:03:22,845 --> 00:03:24,375
What are you talking about?

67
00:03:24,486 --> 00:03:26,715
Hey, if she's not interested in you,

68
00:03:26,716 --> 00:03:28,384
why would she tell you that you were her first love?

69
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:30,015
To clear any misunderstandings.

70
00:03:30,016 --> 00:03:33,185
That's what I mean. Why would she do that?

71
00:03:33,186 --> 00:03:34,555
It's been over 10 years.

72
00:03:34,556 --> 00:03:36,840
And she told you now? For what?

73
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,675
That's because she doesn't want you to be mistaken.

74
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:42,489
Why? Since she's interested in you.

75
00:03:43,936 --> 00:03:46,587
Come on. No way.

76
00:03:51,906 --> 00:03:54,145
Woo Shik, I have something to tell you.

77
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:56,245
Can we meet at the cafe nearby?

78
00:03:56,246 --> 00:03:57,816
Why? What is it?

79
00:03:58,186 --> 00:04:00,115
Soo Yeon wants to meet. She has something to say.

80
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:01,136
Something to say?

81
00:04:02,516 --> 00:04:03,943
I have a gut feeling.

82
00:04:04,486 --> 00:04:07,280
I'm certain she'll ask you out.

83
00:04:07,896 --> 00:04:08,925
- Ask me out? - After she said...

84
00:04:08,926 --> 00:04:10,324
you were her first love,

85
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:13,325
what else would she say to you besides that?

86
00:04:14,035 --> 00:04:16,718
I'm 100 percent certain she's going to ask you out.

87
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:19,774
Trust me, I'm telling you.

88
00:04:20,365 --> 00:04:21,396
Really?

89
00:04:31,216 --> 00:04:33,185
Sorry for suddenly calling you out.

90
00:04:34,656 --> 00:04:35,737
It's fine.

91
00:04:36,055 --> 00:04:37,280
But what is it you want to tell me?

92
00:04:39,685 --> 00:04:40,982
Well, it's...

93
00:04:41,595 --> 00:04:44,565
Woo Shik, are you dating someone recently?

94
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:45,616
What?

95
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:47,147
No, I'm not.

96
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:50,287
Why?

97
00:04:51,206 --> 00:04:52,287
I'm relieved.

98
00:04:53,805 --> 00:04:55,030
The thing is...

99
00:04:58,175 --> 00:05:00,348
Hey, Da Young. Over here.

100
00:05:07,855 --> 00:05:09,956
- Hello. - Hello.

101
00:05:10,086 --> 00:05:12,354
- Who is she? - She's my colleague.

102
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:15,008
She's lonely lately and asked me to set her up on a blind date.

103
00:05:15,295 --> 00:05:17,029
And you suddenly came to my mind.

104
00:05:17,396 --> 00:05:19,161
You two seem perfect together.

105
00:05:19,396 --> 00:05:20,446
What?

106
00:05:21,035 --> 00:05:22,055
A blind date?

107
00:05:22,336 --> 00:05:24,804
The thing she wanted to talk to you about was a blind date?

108
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:27,938
Yes! I'm the lunatic for trusting you again.

109
00:05:28,105 --> 00:05:30,278
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

110
00:05:31,906 --> 00:05:33,333
A blind date...

111
00:05:34,216 --> 00:05:37,511
That girl Soo Yeon is really sneaky.

112
00:05:38,115 --> 00:05:39,207
She's an expert.

113
00:05:39,545 --> 00:05:41,290
- What do you mean? - To me, this seems like...

114
00:05:41,386 --> 00:05:43,221
she's testing you. I'm certain.

115
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:44,978
What?

116
00:05:45,785 --> 00:05:47,794
She's testing me? Why?

117
00:05:47,795 --> 00:05:50,100
Gosh, how could you be so naive?

118
00:05:50,425 --> 00:05:54,444
Brother. There are two types of blind dates.

119
00:05:54,665 --> 00:05:57,012
An ordinary blind date and a blind date that uses bait.

120
00:05:57,136 --> 00:05:59,505
We need to focus on the blind date that uses bait.

121
00:05:59,506 --> 00:06:01,335
A blind date that uses bait? What is that?

122
00:06:01,336 --> 00:06:02,397
I'll explain.

123
00:06:02,836 --> 00:06:05,244
Let's say I like this guy.

124
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:07,827
But I'm not sure if he likes me or not.

125
00:06:07,915 --> 00:06:11,445
At that moment, I suddenly offer to set him up on a blind date.

126
00:06:11,446 --> 00:06:12,784
- And? - And...

127
00:06:12,785 --> 00:06:15,315
if that guy takes the bait and goes out on the blind date,

128
00:06:15,316 --> 00:06:17,050
that means he doesn't like me.

129
00:06:17,156 --> 00:06:19,924
But if he refuses without any particular reason,

130
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:21,426
then that means he likes me.

131
00:06:22,196 --> 00:06:24,825
It's a very advanced skill women use...

132
00:06:24,826 --> 00:06:27,025
when they want to test men they like.

133
00:06:27,026 --> 00:06:28,465
Come on, that's absurd.

134
00:06:28,466 --> 00:06:29,996
If you don't believe me,

135
00:06:30,235 --> 00:06:32,408
just tell her that you'll meet that girl from the blind date.

136
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:35,275
Then Soo Yeon will be so shocked...

137
00:06:35,276 --> 00:06:37,645
and try to stop you and go crazy.

138
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:39,075
Forget it, you can't fool me again!

139
00:06:39,076 --> 00:06:40,268
Do you take me for a fool?

140
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:42,510
I can really trust you, right?

141
00:06:42,615 --> 00:06:44,885
I'm telling you, I'm 100 percent, no...

142
00:06:44,886 --> 00:06:46,681
200 percent certain this time.

143
00:06:47,756 --> 00:06:49,448
Just trust me, okay?

144
00:06:51,256 --> 00:06:54,927
Wow, Woo Shik. Why are you so dressed up today?

145
00:06:54,995 --> 00:06:56,321
Well, it's nothing.

146
00:06:56,396 --> 00:06:58,333
- See you, Yu Ri. - Bye.

147
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:00,486
What?

148
00:07:00,626 --> 00:07:02,265
Yu Ri, where is he going?

149
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:03,592
It's none of your business.

150
00:07:06,066 --> 00:07:07,086
You stink of sweat!

151
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,005
Do you even train on weekends?

152
00:07:10,006 --> 00:07:12,760
He never misses a day of training all year long.

153
00:07:12,906 --> 00:07:14,844
But why are you still in the minor league?

154
00:07:14,845 --> 00:07:16,856
Once I recover from my injury,

155
00:07:16,876 --> 00:07:18,650
I'll be drafted to the major league soon.

156
00:07:19,915 --> 00:07:21,007
It's so hot.

157
00:07:21,285 --> 00:07:22,408
I'm going to take a shower.

158
00:07:23,855 --> 00:07:25,025
Ki Bong.

159
00:07:25,026 --> 00:07:28,015
Wow, your body is as hard as a rock.

160
00:07:28,256 --> 00:07:29,294
But what?

161
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:31,724
That skinny dude Jun Ki might beat him?

162
00:07:31,725 --> 00:07:32,924
Who knows?

163
00:07:32,925 --> 00:07:34,394
You're being so stubborn.

164
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:35,965
Ki Bong, be honest with me.

165
00:07:35,966 --> 00:07:37,094
You really can't win Jun Ki in a fight?

166
00:07:37,095 --> 00:07:40,298
That again? Why are you so curious about that?

167
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:43,800
But to tell you the truth,

168
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:46,902
Jun Ki and I are on a totally different level.

169
00:07:47,146 --> 00:07:49,115
For instance, if Jun Ki is an elementary student,

170
00:07:49,175 --> 00:07:50,644
I'm like Mike Tyson.

171
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:53,145
What would happen if a little kid hit Mike Tyson?

172
00:07:53,146 --> 00:07:54,379
It will only tickle.

173
00:07:54,386 --> 00:07:56,049
I can beat him with one fist...

174
00:07:56,785 --> 00:08:00,049
No. I'll just use my knuckles...

175
00:08:00,185 --> 00:08:02,695
and knock him out cold.

176
00:08:02,696 --> 00:08:05,265
So you mean you can beat him?

177
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:07,265
Well, I'm not saying I'm certain.

178
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:08,796
Whatever, forget it.

179
00:08:10,035 --> 00:08:11,597
I better go take a shower.

180
00:08:12,435 --> 00:08:15,474
What? Ki Bong said he can beat me?

181
00:08:15,475 --> 00:08:18,710
Yes. He said you were just a little kid compared to him.

182
00:08:18,845 --> 00:08:20,844
He said it would tickle no matter how hard you hit him,

183
00:08:20,845 --> 00:08:22,674
and he could knock you out with his knuckles.

184
00:08:22,675 --> 00:08:24,585
What? Knuckles?

185
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:27,033
Hey, Jun Ki. Is it true Ki Bong will beat you up?

186
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:32,454
Hey, why is winning and losing so important between friends?

187
00:08:32,455 --> 00:08:33,577
My goodness.

188
00:08:35,026 --> 00:08:36,046
But you know what?

189
00:08:36,055 --> 00:08:38,066
He's a big guy, so he'll be slow.

190
00:08:39,195 --> 00:08:40,288
I'm nimble though.

191
00:08:40,695 --> 00:08:43,828
He can't hit me no matter how strong he is. What's he going to do?

192
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:47,891
Also, I get that he's a big guy, but is he made of steel or what?

193
00:08:48,606 --> 00:08:49,727
I will...

194
00:08:50,305 --> 00:08:53,815
keep dodging and throwing punches at him like this.

195
00:08:56,276 --> 00:08:58,325
If I keep punching him like that, it'll be game over.

196
00:08:59,185 --> 00:09:00,307
Game over.

197
00:09:00,886 --> 00:09:03,214
So you're saying you'll win.

198
00:09:03,215 --> 00:09:05,909
No, not necessarily. I'm just saying...

199
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:09,697
Gosh, hey. Forget it. Let's just drop this topic.

200
00:09:11,396 --> 00:09:12,691
I should just let it go.

201
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:16,464
We boil Korean pigs' feet...

202
00:09:16,465 --> 00:09:20,239
for over 10 hours with 20 medicinal herbs.

203
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:23,160
- Welcome to Jo An's Jokbal. - Hello.

204
00:09:23,435 --> 00:09:25,792
- Welcome to Jo An's Jokbal. - Our jokbal is delicious.

205
00:09:27,445 --> 00:09:29,660
Hey, Soo Yeon. It's hard, isn't it?

206
00:09:30,016 --> 00:09:32,414
- Here. - Thanks.

207
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,211
No problem. You introduced me to Woo Shik.

208
00:09:35,415 --> 00:09:36,814
I should thank you.

209
00:09:36,815 --> 00:09:39,641
No, I just thought that you two would make a cute couple.

210
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:42,178
I'm sorry, Da Young.

211
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:46,148
"Sorry"?

212
00:09:46,526 --> 00:09:47,688
That's it?

213
00:09:47,835 --> 00:09:50,039
Do you think saying sorry is enough? You bonehead!

214
00:09:51,165 --> 00:09:52,328
- Da Young. - Hey!

215
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:54,534
Can you not control your limbs?

216
00:09:54,535 --> 00:09:57,845
You can't even stand steadily. Why would you even work here?

217
00:09:57,846 --> 00:10:00,151
Just go home and lie down on your bed!

218
00:10:01,646 --> 00:10:03,757
I'm sorry, Da Young. I'll wipe your shoes for you.

219
00:10:09,256 --> 00:10:11,531
Do you think I'm being like this because of my shoes?

220
00:10:11,626 --> 00:10:14,176
I don't even need these shoes.

221
00:10:15,455 --> 00:10:16,720
These shoes.

222
00:10:18,925 --> 00:10:21,038
I don't need them.

223
00:10:28,205 --> 00:10:29,532
So don't you dare...

224
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:32,572
step on my feet again.

225
00:10:33,006 --> 00:10:34,026
Got it?

226
00:10:36,016 --> 00:10:37,138
Move!

227
00:10:42,386 --> 00:10:43,885
What is with her?

228
00:10:43,886 --> 00:10:46,684
You didn't know? She's a psycho.

229
00:10:46,685 --> 00:10:49,990
- A psycho? - She's mean and has a short temper.

230
00:10:50,055 --> 00:10:51,664
When a guy we used to work with...

231
00:10:51,665 --> 00:10:53,257
accidentally spat in her face while talking,

232
00:10:53,325 --> 00:10:55,495
she hit him with a microphone. He even had to be hospitalized...

233
00:10:55,496 --> 00:10:56,595
for four weeks.

234
00:10:56,596 --> 00:10:58,646
What? For four weeks?

235
00:10:59,606 --> 00:11:02,737
Did you really set her up on a blind date?

236
00:11:03,035 --> 00:11:04,473
Why did you do that?

237
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:10,211
- Soo Yeon. - What? Hey, Woo Shik.

238
00:11:10,846 --> 00:11:12,652
- What brings you here? - What?

239
00:11:13,285 --> 00:11:14,786
I'm here to take Da Young out on a date.

240
00:11:14,915 --> 00:11:16,008
A date?

241
00:11:17,656 --> 00:11:20,454
Are you really going to date Da Young?

242
00:11:20,455 --> 00:11:22,597
What? Why do you ask?

243
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:25,725
Is there a reason I shouldn't date her?

244
00:11:26,726 --> 00:11:29,552
- Woo Shik, the thing is... - Woo Shik!

245
00:11:30,665 --> 00:11:33,288
What brings you here? I didn't know you'd be coming.

246
00:11:33,305 --> 00:11:35,723
Oh, I'm obviously here to see you.

247
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,357
I thought it'd be nice to grab a beer together.

248
00:11:38,776 --> 00:11:41,544
I'll be done soon, so please wait just a few minutes.

249
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:44,300
Sure. Hey, weren't you going to say something earlier?

250
00:11:45,646 --> 00:11:48,879
What is it? Soo Yeon, do you have...

251
00:11:49,055 --> 00:11:51,228
- something to say to Woo Shik? - What?

252
00:11:53,555 --> 00:11:57,401
Well, no. It was nothing.

253
00:11:57,965 --> 00:12:00,342
- Nothing, right? - Yes, nothing.

254
00:12:11,006 --> 00:12:13,845
You must be tired. You should go home and get some rest.

255
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:14,897
What?

256
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:16,836
Well...

257
00:12:17,616 --> 00:12:19,932
I want some beer too.

258
00:12:20,116 --> 00:12:21,184
What's going on?

259
00:12:21,185 --> 00:12:22,686
Why did she follow us all the way here?

260
00:12:23,055 --> 00:12:24,442
This is strange.

261
00:12:25,386 --> 00:12:26,578
(My enemy)

262
00:12:28,096 --> 00:12:30,136
It's my sister. Excuse me for a moment.

263
00:12:30,856 --> 00:12:31,946
Hey, Yu Ri.

264
00:12:33,526 --> 00:12:34,963
I have to run to the washroom.

265
00:12:34,996 --> 00:12:36,118
Soo Yeon.

266
00:12:36,766 --> 00:12:39,866
I'm hungry. Can we decide on what food to order before you go?

267
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:42,117
When I'm hungry,

268
00:12:43,276 --> 00:12:44,601
I get angry.

269
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:49,327
Oh, really?

270
00:12:53,415 --> 00:12:54,538
Let's just get fried chicken.

271
00:12:54,616 --> 00:12:57,255
Hey! Don't you know that I'm on a diet?

272
00:12:57,256 --> 00:12:58,989
You want me to eat fried chicken and gain weight?

273
00:12:59,526 --> 00:13:01,015
No, no.

274
00:13:01,695 --> 00:13:02,777
I'm sorry.

275
00:13:05,496 --> 00:13:06,649
Then...

276
00:13:07,866 --> 00:13:11,095
- shall we order a salad? - Do you think it'll be filling?

277
00:13:11,096 --> 00:13:13,380
I told you that I'm hungry.

278
00:13:15,006 --> 00:13:16,056
Then...

279
00:13:16,835 --> 00:13:20,478
- What? She followed you to the pub? - Yes!

280
00:13:21,045 --> 00:13:24,483
I told her to go home, but she insisted on joining us.

281
00:13:24,746 --> 00:13:27,954
She's obviously so anxious.

282
00:13:27,955 --> 00:13:30,755
See? I told you that Soo Yeon is interested in you as well.

283
00:13:30,756 --> 00:13:32,694
- You really think so? - Yes, of course.

284
00:13:32,756 --> 00:13:35,395
She must've been so anxious to tag along to the pub.

285
00:13:35,396 --> 00:13:36,518
You think so?

286
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:47,357
This one. Sausage...

287
00:13:48,276 --> 00:13:49,356
and veggie stir-fry?

288
00:13:51,305 --> 00:13:55,145
Hey! How many times have I told you that I'm on a diet? You idiot!

289
00:13:55,146 --> 00:13:57,645
You want me to eat sausage and gain weight?

290
00:13:57,646 --> 00:14:00,196
No, it's not that. You said...

291
00:14:04,356 --> 00:14:07,284
You can eat anything because you're slim?

292
00:14:07,285 --> 00:14:08,755
Good for you.

293
00:14:08,756 --> 00:14:10,939
Since I'm fat, I shall just eat the menu.

294
00:14:18,906 --> 00:14:20,130
It's delicious.

295
00:14:21,406 --> 00:14:22,630
I'm sorry, Da Young.

296
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:28,516
You'd better not take this long to order food next time.

297
00:14:29,045 --> 00:14:31,259
- Do you understand? - Yes.

298
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:45,495
But for some reason, Soo Yeon's eyes look very nervous.

299
00:14:45,496 --> 00:14:48,729
She's worried that things might go well between you and that girl.

300
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:51,905
How shall I put this though? It's more than just nervousness.

301
00:14:51,906 --> 00:14:53,564
Shall I say she looks horrified?

302
00:14:53,565 --> 00:14:57,534
The thought of you dating that girl is horrifying for Soo Yeon.

303
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,903
Oh, I see.

304
00:14:59,705 --> 00:15:03,348
That means Soo Yeon has feelings for me as well.

305
00:15:08,016 --> 00:15:10,954
- What? Jun Ki said he can beat me? - Yes.

306
00:15:10,955 --> 00:15:13,068
He said he can dodge all your punches because you're slow.

307
00:15:13,126 --> 00:15:16,666
He said he will keep dodging and throwing punches at you like this.

308
00:15:18,195 --> 00:15:19,765
"Game over." That's what he said.

309
00:15:19,766 --> 00:15:20,888
What the...

310
00:15:21,766 --> 00:15:24,564
Fine, let's say he'll win.

311
00:15:24,565 --> 00:15:27,422
- I'm exhausted. I need to rest. - Okay, get some rest.

312
00:15:28,476 --> 00:15:29,496
What?

313
00:15:29,636 --> 00:15:30,726
I'm slow?

314
00:15:31,075 --> 00:15:33,217
He'll dodge all my punches?

315
00:15:34,945 --> 00:15:36,200
I'm back.

316
00:15:48,356 --> 00:15:49,519
Where were you?

317
00:15:49,955 --> 00:15:52,170
What? Well...

318
00:15:52,665 --> 00:15:55,318
I went to some film production companies to drop off my acting CV.

319
00:15:56,366 --> 00:15:57,519
By the way,

320
00:15:57,866 --> 00:15:59,599
Jung Eun told me...

321
00:16:00,006 --> 00:16:02,148
that you said you're sure you can beat me.

322
00:16:02,805 --> 00:16:04,030
Oh, that.

323
00:16:04,476 --> 00:16:07,607
That wasn't specifically about you.

324
00:16:07,846 --> 00:16:11,314
I simply explained to her that having a big physique...

325
00:16:11,315 --> 00:16:12,978
isn't that important in fighting.

326
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:16,810
I see. I wondered what you meant by it.

327
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:24,927
But I heard you also said you're sure you can beat me.

328
00:16:25,695 --> 00:16:28,592
Didn't you say a knuckle is enough to knock me out?

329
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:34,149
Well, that wasn't specifically about you.

330
00:16:34,366 --> 00:16:35,865
I just told her...

331
00:16:36,305 --> 00:16:39,131
that having a strong physique does matter in fighting.

332
00:16:39,246 --> 00:16:41,521
I did say that.

333
00:16:42,415 --> 00:16:43,905
I see.

334
00:16:44,445 --> 00:16:45,843
I was wondering what you meant.

335
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:52,025
Jun Ki, did you ever hear this story...

336
00:16:52,026 --> 00:16:54,155
- back in high school? - No, never.

337
00:16:54,156 --> 00:16:55,726
- Then I should tell you. - What?

338
00:16:55,856 --> 00:16:58,070
The rice cake skewer battle.

339
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,964
I was the hero of the story.

340
00:17:00,965 --> 00:17:02,189
"The rice cake skewer battle"?

341
00:17:02,295 --> 00:17:03,765
This is my first time hearing about it.

342
00:17:03,766 --> 00:17:07,070
Then you must be curious, so I really should tell you.

343
00:17:08,306 --> 00:17:11,978
The wind felt exceptionally cold that day.

344
00:17:21,786 --> 00:17:23,112
Oh, isn't that...

345
00:17:23,415 --> 00:17:26,077
my best friend, Min Guk?

346
00:17:27,485 --> 00:17:31,606
Hey, I'm craving delicious rice cake skewers.

347
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:34,620
Give me some money, will you?

348
00:17:34,896 --> 00:17:36,059
Hey.

349
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:43,279
What on earth are you doing to my best friend...

350
00:17:43,735 --> 00:17:46,204
- in broad daylight? - Who is this punk?

351
00:17:46,205 --> 00:17:48,274
I do not think that it'll be necessary...

352
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,592
to exchange names.

353
00:17:51,175 --> 00:17:54,614
You'd better let my friend go while I'm still...

354
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:55,840
being nice to you.

355
00:17:57,685 --> 00:18:00,684
They say that fools rush in where others fear to tread.

356
00:18:00,685 --> 00:18:01,818
Boys!

357
00:18:12,836 --> 00:18:16,478
You punks are like pests that flock together.

358
00:18:16,576 --> 00:18:18,279
Today, I shall...

359
00:18:18,975 --> 00:18:20,301
exterminate you all.

360
00:18:23,376 --> 00:18:24,436
- Come at me! - Hey!

361
00:18:51,406 --> 00:18:53,845
Ki Bong, you saved me.

362
00:18:53,846 --> 00:18:55,070
Thank you so much!

363
00:18:56,046 --> 00:18:59,244
Friends don't thank each other.

364
00:18:59,245 --> 00:19:01,704
Goodbye, then.

365
00:19:07,086 --> 00:19:09,625
You liar! You expect me to believe that?

366
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:11,085
Don't, then.

367
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,117
What I'm trying to say is...

368
00:19:14,296 --> 00:19:15,898
I may be a big guy,

369
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:18,065
but I'm surprisingly fast.

370
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:19,637
Those swift taekwondo players...

371
00:19:19,665 --> 00:19:22,390
couldn't dodge any of my blows.

372
00:19:22,576 --> 00:19:25,054
Alright, alright. Whatever you say.

373
00:19:25,975 --> 00:19:29,375
But since you mention the old days, something came to my mind.

374
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,140
I wonder if you've heard of the "Legend of the 1-to-18 Match"?

375
00:19:32,215 --> 00:19:34,286
"Legend of the 1-to-18 Match"?

376
00:19:34,816 --> 00:19:38,283
The sky was unusually high and blue that day...

377
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:45,503
Leave me alone.

378
00:19:45,925 --> 00:19:47,089
Hey, kid.

379
00:19:47,425 --> 00:19:50,095
Why don't you hand over that rare card, already?

380
00:19:50,096 --> 00:19:53,267
No! I really can't give you this.

381
00:19:57,336 --> 00:19:59,753
You rascal! Will I have to force you?

382
00:20:02,945 --> 00:20:04,037
How about you stop?

383
00:20:06,546 --> 00:20:08,145
What's this?

384
00:20:08,146 --> 00:20:12,103
You can call me a human cleaner, who cleans up human garbage like you.

385
00:20:12,656 --> 00:20:13,706
What?

386
00:20:15,495 --> 00:20:18,729
I guess you're really looking forward to your funeral, aren't you?

387
00:20:23,866 --> 00:20:24,917
Guys!

388
00:20:39,945 --> 00:20:40,965
Get him!

389
00:20:49,925 --> 00:20:52,475
(Iryeong Station)

390
00:21:05,975 --> 00:21:08,145
You liar. 1-to-18, my foot.

391
00:21:08,146 --> 00:21:11,307
Okay, sure. Don't believe me, then. Forget it.

392
00:21:11,376 --> 00:21:13,896
But what I'm trying to say is...

393
00:21:13,945 --> 00:21:17,221
I may be a small guy, but I have destructive powers.

394
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:21,883
Those huge baseball players were no match to my blows.

395
00:21:21,995 --> 00:21:24,679
Okay, sure. If you say so.

396
00:21:30,995 --> 00:21:32,260
Thank you for dinner, Woo Shik.

397
00:21:32,435 --> 00:21:33,731
It was nothing.

398
00:21:37,136 --> 00:21:38,432
I left my cellphone back there.

399
00:21:38,806 --> 00:21:40,029
Just a minute.

400
00:21:42,715 --> 00:21:46,115
Woo Shik, I have to tell you something.

401
00:21:46,116 --> 00:21:47,513
Tell me something? What is it?

402
00:21:48,146 --> 00:21:49,340
Do you...

403
00:21:50,356 --> 00:21:52,672
have to go out with Da Young?

404
00:21:53,386 --> 00:21:55,058
Can you just not go out with her?

405
00:21:55,326 --> 00:21:57,397
What? Look at her!

406
00:21:57,495 --> 00:21:59,056
She's being so obvious, now.

407
00:21:59,366 --> 00:22:02,936
She must be so worried that I might start dating Da Young!

408
00:22:04,735 --> 00:22:05,959
Why are you smiling all of a sudden?

409
00:22:06,536 --> 00:22:07,556
It's nothing.

410
00:22:09,235 --> 00:22:10,434
But why?

411
00:22:10,435 --> 00:22:14,180
Why shouldn't I start dating Da Young?

412
00:22:15,346 --> 00:22:18,376
I think I might have made a mistake.

413
00:22:18,445 --> 00:22:19,771
A mistake?

414
00:22:19,945 --> 00:22:22,567
I wonder what kind of mistake you could have made,

415
00:22:22,886 --> 00:22:24,754
Soo Yeon?

416
00:22:24,755 --> 00:22:27,102
The thing is, Woo Shik... Actually,

417
00:22:28,126 --> 00:22:29,656
- Da Young is... - Alright.

418
00:22:30,195 --> 00:22:31,521
I get it. That's enough.

419
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:32,764
I know everything.

420
00:22:32,765 --> 00:22:33,817
You know?

421
00:22:35,465 --> 00:22:37,639
- Really? - How can I not know?

422
00:22:38,136 --> 00:22:39,264
You're making it so obvious.

423
00:22:39,265 --> 00:22:41,035
You could tell, too?

424
00:22:41,036 --> 00:22:43,218
Of course. I'm not stupid.

425
00:22:45,005 --> 00:22:48,145
What's going on? What's so funny, you two?

426
00:22:48,146 --> 00:22:50,696
Oh, it's a secret.

427
00:22:50,816 --> 00:22:54,111
A secret between Soo Yeon and I.

428
00:22:57,255 --> 00:23:00,155
It's getting late. We should head home.

429
00:23:00,156 --> 00:23:02,196
Already? You go ahead.

430
00:23:02,396 --> 00:23:04,191
We'll grab a cup of coffee.

431
00:23:05,225 --> 00:23:06,796
- Is that okay, Woo Shik? - Sure.

432
00:23:07,465 --> 00:23:08,660
Let's go somewhere nice.

433
00:23:09,935 --> 00:23:11,874
- A good place would be... - What are you talking about?

434
00:23:12,165 --> 00:23:13,204
You're going to get coffee with her?

435
00:23:13,205 --> 00:23:14,704
I'll take care of it myself.

436
00:23:14,705 --> 00:23:17,735
Don't worry and go on home. Okay?

437
00:23:18,036 --> 00:23:19,882
Okay.

438
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:22,918
Da Young, wait for me.

439
00:23:33,185 --> 00:23:35,235
My muscles feel like they're about to explode.

440
00:23:39,066 --> 00:23:40,964
It's been a long time, but my kicks are still as fast as lightning.

441
00:23:40,965 --> 00:23:42,088
No, they're not,

442
00:23:43,195 --> 00:23:46,296
I should start getting ready for bed before my muscles explode.

443
00:23:47,866 --> 00:23:50,355
I can still do 1,000 more kicks,

444
00:23:50,906 --> 00:23:52,231
but I should go to bed for tomorrow.

445
00:23:57,975 --> 00:23:59,680
- Good night, then. - You, too.

446
00:24:28,106 --> 00:24:29,167
Hey, Ki Bong.

447
00:24:29,445 --> 00:24:30,568
What are you doing?

448
00:24:36,415 --> 00:24:38,905
- What did I do? - I never told you this,

449
00:24:39,985 --> 00:24:42,035
but did you know that you always hog the sheets?

450
00:24:42,225 --> 00:24:43,889
I do not.

451
00:24:44,296 --> 00:24:46,264
You always hog the sheets.

452
00:24:46,265 --> 00:24:47,347
Whatever.

453
00:24:48,165 --> 00:24:51,430
If you pull the sheets to your side one more time,

454
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,234
I'm not going to ignore it.

455
00:24:53,235 --> 00:24:56,674
If you don't ignore it, what are you going to do?

456
00:24:57,906 --> 00:25:00,875
What? You want to witness a catastrophe?

457
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:02,752
Catastrophe, my foot.

458
00:25:02,945 --> 00:25:04,615
So what are you going to do about it?

459
00:25:04,616 --> 00:25:06,115
Why, you!

460
00:25:06,116 --> 00:25:09,012
I was too soft on you, wasn't I?

461
00:25:13,925 --> 00:25:15,251
Hey, did you guys see my phone?

462
00:25:18,626 --> 00:25:19,850
What are you two doing?

463
00:25:22,995 --> 00:25:26,065
This punk kept hogging the sheets!

464
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,464
I did not!

465
00:25:27,465 --> 00:25:28,875
Do you have proof? Do you?

466
00:25:28,876 --> 00:25:32,504
Fine. Then let's settle once and for all, who gets the sheets.

467
00:25:32,505 --> 00:25:34,179
Fine. Let's do that.

468
00:25:34,475 --> 00:25:35,536
Let's take it outside.

469
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,513
Thank you for the coffee.

470
00:25:38,985 --> 00:25:40,209
It was nothing.

471
00:25:41,945 --> 00:25:43,037
Woo Shik.

472
00:25:44,185 --> 00:25:45,890
When should we meet again?

473
00:25:46,126 --> 00:25:47,177
What?

474
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:50,918
Da Young, I need to tell you something.

475
00:25:51,255 --> 00:25:53,265
- What is it? - The thing is...

476
00:25:55,636 --> 00:25:57,064
Just a minute.

477
00:25:57,435 --> 00:25:58,996
Yes, hello?

478
00:26:04,306 --> 00:26:05,836
He's doing it again.

479
00:26:06,346 --> 00:26:09,742
Why does he keep taking phone calls in the middle of his sentence?

480
00:26:10,576 --> 00:26:12,892
He's got no manners at all.

481
00:26:13,346 --> 00:26:14,436
No manners!

482
00:26:14,945 --> 00:26:15,975
No manners!

483
00:26:16,185 --> 00:26:20,055
Really? Soo Yeon blatantly said that you shouldn't date her?

484
00:26:20,056 --> 00:26:21,385
That's what I'm telling you!

485
00:26:21,386 --> 00:26:24,110
I think she really does like me, just like you said.

486
00:26:24,425 --> 00:26:26,844
I almost made myself look stupid if it weren't for you.

487
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:27,985
Thanks!

488
00:26:29,665 --> 00:26:30,961
No problem.

489
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,204
You have to make it official, now.

490
00:26:34,205 --> 00:26:36,575
- What do you mean? - You have to ask Soo Yeon out!

491
00:26:36,576 --> 00:26:38,204
Ask her out? Already?

492
00:26:38,205 --> 00:26:41,205
If you want to make it work, it has to be when she's desperate.

493
00:26:42,376 --> 00:26:44,974
- Don't you trust me? - Of course, I do. At all cost!

494
00:26:44,975 --> 00:26:46,184
But how do I ask her out?

495
00:26:46,185 --> 00:26:48,645
What? You made family plans,

496
00:26:48,646 --> 00:26:50,014
but not a plan to ask her out?

497
00:26:50,015 --> 00:26:52,372
How could I do that?

498
00:26:53,425 --> 00:26:54,476
I did have one plan, though...

499
00:26:54,955 --> 00:26:57,036
No manners! No manners!

500
00:26:57,255 --> 00:26:58,929
No manners!

501
00:27:02,235 --> 00:27:04,000
I feel much better now.

502
00:27:10,136 --> 00:27:12,605
I apologize, Da Young. It was something urgent.

503
00:27:12,606 --> 00:27:14,747
That's okay.

504
00:27:15,076 --> 00:27:17,115
What were you about to tell me a while ago?

505
00:27:17,116 --> 00:27:19,257
Oh, that. I think...

506
00:27:19,386 --> 00:27:21,984
today will be the last time we see each other.

507
00:27:21,985 --> 00:27:24,638
I actually have someone that I like.

508
00:27:25,985 --> 00:27:28,585
Then why did you agree on a blind date?

509
00:27:28,586 --> 00:27:29,882
I was in some kind of situation...

510
00:27:31,156 --> 00:27:33,166
Situation? What situation?

511
00:27:33,965 --> 00:27:34,985
Tell me.

512
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,725
I can't really tell you...

513
00:27:37,336 --> 00:27:39,964
But why are you talking down on me, all of a sudden?

514
00:27:39,965 --> 00:27:43,204
Quit the blabbering and tell me, you idiot!

515
00:27:43,205 --> 00:27:44,305
Do I look like a toy to you?

516
00:27:44,306 --> 00:27:46,974
Why did you go on a blind date if you like someone else?

517
00:27:46,975 --> 00:27:48,985
Are blind dates your hobby? Is it an activity for you?

518
00:27:49,275 --> 00:27:53,060
You... You... Good-for-nothing fool!

519
00:27:53,245 --> 00:27:54,265
Da Young!

520
00:27:59,425 --> 00:28:00,506
Fine.

521
00:28:01,185 --> 00:28:02,655
I'll give you one last chance.

522
00:28:03,826 --> 00:28:05,081
What was the situation?

523
00:28:05,695 --> 00:28:06,890
Tell me about it.

524
00:28:07,066 --> 00:28:09,953
I told you, I can't tell you!

525
00:28:10,066 --> 00:28:11,493
I guess you won't do.

526
00:28:30,255 --> 00:28:32,571
Da Young, what are you doing? Are you looking for something?

527
00:28:38,596 --> 00:28:40,299
Why are you lifting that chair?

528
00:28:43,995 --> 00:28:47,913
Then shall we find out who the real owner...

529
00:28:48,505 --> 00:28:50,209
- of that blanket is? - Before that,

530
00:28:50,505 --> 00:28:53,331
no matter what happens as a result of this fight,

531
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,141
let's promise not to hold each other responsible.

532
00:28:55,675 --> 00:28:57,176
- Okay? - Of course.

533
00:28:57,876 --> 00:29:00,640
All right, then. Shall we begin?

534
00:29:01,586 --> 00:29:02,810
Don't regret it.

535
00:29:20,205 --> 00:29:21,256
Excuse me.

536
00:29:23,036 --> 00:29:26,474
Misters, I'm really hungry right now.

537
00:29:26,475 --> 00:29:27,833
Can you give me some money?

538
00:29:27,876 --> 00:29:28,997
Oh, hold on.

539
00:29:29,975 --> 00:29:31,954
Hey. What are you doing?

540
00:29:36,086 --> 00:29:38,871
Hey, kid. What are you talking about?

541
00:29:38,925 --> 00:29:42,454
Hey. Are you trying to take money from us right now?

542
00:29:42,455 --> 00:29:44,291
I'm just asking you to lend me some.

543
00:29:44,356 --> 00:29:45,764
I don't know when I'll pay you back though.

544
00:29:45,765 --> 00:29:47,092
You don't know when?

545
00:29:48,025 --> 00:29:50,718
- This is unbelievable. - Seriously.

546
00:29:51,096 --> 00:29:53,035
Ki Bong, there's been a change of plans.

547
00:29:53,036 --> 00:29:55,148
- Let's take care of him first. - All right.

548
00:29:55,576 --> 00:29:59,177
Hey, kid. Stay right where you are.

549
00:30:08,485 --> 00:30:09,709
It's so pretty.

550
00:30:11,116 --> 00:30:12,206
I'm cold.

551
00:30:12,586 --> 00:30:14,462
Yu Ri, why did we come here so late?

552
00:30:14,586 --> 00:30:17,395
It's just that the weather is so lovely.

553
00:30:17,396 --> 00:30:19,100
It isn't lovely at all.

554
00:30:19,265 --> 00:30:21,224
I heard the fine dust is really severe today.

555
00:30:21,225 --> 00:30:23,409
Still, isn't it romantic here?

556
00:30:27,765 --> 00:30:30,153
- Why are you laughing? - Because you're cute.

557
00:30:30,336 --> 00:30:33,844
I thought you were just chic and sly, but you're a real woman.

558
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:35,815
What do you mean?

559
00:30:35,816 --> 00:30:37,173
I already know.

560
00:30:37,675 --> 00:30:39,414
I heard you set up Woo Shik on a blind date.

561
00:30:39,415 --> 00:30:40,435
What?

562
00:30:41,886 --> 00:30:42,976
Yes.

563
00:30:43,116 --> 00:30:46,727
- But you were really anxious? - Yes.

564
00:30:46,985 --> 00:30:49,883
I regret setting him up on that blind date. I was so anxious.

565
00:30:50,896 --> 00:30:52,895
Why did you set him up in the first place?

566
00:30:52,896 --> 00:30:55,375
- You should've told him the truth. - I know.

567
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,986
I really didn't know she was such a psycho.

568
00:30:59,136 --> 00:31:00,156
What?

569
00:31:00,306 --> 00:31:01,387
What? A psycho?

570
00:31:02,005 --> 00:31:04,280
- Who? - The girl I set him up with.

571
00:31:04,636 --> 00:31:07,666
It turns out, she was a total psycho.

572
00:31:07,846 --> 00:31:11,386
I was so anxious she might hurt Woo Shik or something.

573
00:31:11,415 --> 00:31:12,711
What?

574
00:31:12,886 --> 00:31:14,375
Wait a minute.

575
00:31:15,616 --> 00:31:17,492
Were you anxious about that?

576
00:31:17,886 --> 00:31:21,024
There's no other reason besides that?

577
00:31:21,025 --> 00:31:22,179
Another reason?

578
00:31:23,525 --> 00:31:25,259
No. Why?

579
00:31:27,765 --> 00:31:28,847
This isn't right.

580
00:31:31,836 --> 00:31:32,957
That startled me.

581
00:31:34,536 --> 00:31:35,698
What is this?

582
00:31:36,106 --> 00:31:37,298
What's this song?

583
00:31:40,346 --> 00:31:43,232
I don't know. I guess they're doing something here.

584
00:31:43,675 --> 00:31:46,094
Soo Yeon, let's go. It's cold.

585
00:31:46,146 --> 00:31:48,345
It must be some sort of event. Let's take a look.

586
00:31:48,346 --> 00:31:50,555
There's no need to look. The air is full of fine dust right now.

587
00:31:50,556 --> 00:31:51,954
Come on, let's get going.

588
00:31:51,955 --> 00:31:53,109
Soo Yeon!

589
00:32:07,566 --> 00:32:08,687
It's Woo Shik.

590
00:32:09,505 --> 00:32:10,729
What is he doing here?

591
00:32:15,753 --> 00:32:20,753
<font color="#8080ff">[VIU Ver] jTBC E05 'Eulachacha Waikiki 2'</font>
<font color="#ff8080">"Dreams Come True"</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

592
00:32:25,156 --> 00:32:28,287
Gosh. Yu Ri, isn't his nose bleeding?

593
00:32:29,525 --> 00:32:31,259
What is that bouquet he's holding?

594
00:32:33,425 --> 00:32:34,517
The thing is...

595
00:32:35,366 --> 00:32:36,694
He's working part-time.

596
00:32:36,695 --> 00:32:38,735
He works part-time selling flowers around here.

597
00:32:38,796 --> 00:32:41,284
So let's stop disturbing him and go, okay?

598
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:42,774
Still, we should say hi.

599
00:32:42,775 --> 00:32:45,105
There's no need to say hi. You see each other every day.

600
00:32:45,106 --> 00:32:46,268
Let's go, already.

601
00:32:50,445 --> 00:32:51,465
Woo Shik.

602
00:32:52,616 --> 00:32:53,667
We're not buying.

603
00:32:53,985 --> 00:32:55,067
We're not buying.

604
00:32:55,856 --> 00:32:57,417
We're not buying any flowers!

605
00:32:59,386 --> 00:33:00,855
Don't come. Stop!

606
00:33:01,856 --> 00:33:02,977
We're not buying.

607
00:33:03,826 --> 00:33:07,366
No, not that. We're not buying!

608
00:33:08,025 --> 00:33:09,158
I said, we're not buying!

609
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,228
This is driving me nuts.

610
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:20,345
What should I do?

611
00:33:24,316 --> 00:33:25,468
Soo Yeon.

612
00:33:27,985 --> 00:33:29,108
I...

613
00:33:29,955 --> 00:33:31,485
- like... - No!

614
00:33:49,806 --> 00:33:51,978
Yu Ri, what on earth have you done?

615
00:33:56,616 --> 00:33:58,687
I said I didn't want to buy any flowers.

616
00:33:59,146 --> 00:34:01,226
He kept bothering me.

617
00:34:01,445 --> 00:34:02,609
But still...

618
00:34:04,086 --> 00:34:05,238
Woo Shik.

619
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:07,348
Woo Shik.

620
00:34:08,286 --> 00:34:11,080
Woo Shik, open your eyes. My gosh.

621
00:34:14,496 --> 00:34:16,200
Hey, what's wrong with your faces?

622
00:34:16,766 --> 00:34:18,164
Did you really fight?

623
00:34:20,636 --> 00:34:23,075
So, who became the real owner of that blanket?

624
00:34:23,076 --> 00:34:25,788
What? It was a draw.

625
00:34:26,275 --> 00:34:27,975
It was difficult to determine who was stronger.

626
00:34:27,976 --> 00:34:30,159
Ki Bong was stronger than I expected.

627
00:34:30,576 --> 00:34:32,106
It was neck and neck.

628
00:34:34,715 --> 00:34:35,910
Excuse me.

629
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,615
Yes, who are you?

630
00:34:39,085 --> 00:34:40,655
I'm sorry to come so late at night.

631
00:34:40,656 --> 00:34:43,685
Do Mr. Lee Jun Ki and Mr. Kook Ki Bong live here?

632
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,676
Yes, that's us. What's this about?

633
00:34:47,096 --> 00:34:48,351
The thing is...

634
00:34:48,925 --> 00:34:50,160
Hold on.

635
00:34:50,565 --> 00:34:52,474
Eom Seok Dae, get your butt in here!

636
00:34:54,666 --> 00:34:55,829
You little...

637
00:34:59,945 --> 00:35:01,245
What is this about?

638
00:35:01,246 --> 00:35:03,693
Well, the thing is, I found these...

639
00:35:04,746 --> 00:35:06,173
wallets inside my son's backpack.

640
00:35:06,746 --> 00:35:08,450
These belong to you, right?

641
00:35:09,016 --> 00:35:10,954
Yes...

642
00:35:13,686 --> 00:35:14,706
(Lee Jun Ki)

643
00:35:16,425 --> 00:35:17,620
These really are your wallets.

644
00:35:18,025 --> 00:35:19,760
But why are they in his backpack?

645
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:23,982
We just gave them to him so he can buy snacks.

646
00:35:24,266 --> 00:35:26,104
High school kids lately are stressed from studying.

647
00:35:26,105 --> 00:35:28,411
My son goes to middle school.

648
00:35:28,866 --> 00:35:31,405
- He's in 7th grade. - 7th grade?

649
00:35:31,406 --> 00:35:32,803
You're in middle school.

650
00:35:33,775 --> 00:35:36,615
Middle school students suffer from going to all those academies lately.

651
00:35:36,616 --> 00:35:37,829
You should've given him money then.

652
00:35:37,853 --> 00:35:39,345
Why did you give him your wallets?

653
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:40,774
Well, that's...

654
00:35:41,545 --> 00:35:44,341
Our wallets were old, so we gave them to him as a gift.

655
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:46,006
Really?

656
00:35:46,156 --> 00:35:48,778
Then why did you give him your IDs and credit cards as well?

657
00:35:51,096 --> 00:35:52,424
We wanted him to learn.

658
00:35:52,425 --> 00:35:56,211
It was our way of teaching him how adults used their wallets.

659
00:35:56,266 --> 00:35:59,805
No way. Did that kid take your wallets?

660
00:36:00,206 --> 00:36:02,991
Is that why you're hurt? Because he beat you guys up?

661
00:36:03,175 --> 00:36:04,535
Eom Seok Dae, tell me the truth!

662
00:36:04,536 --> 00:36:06,515
- Did you hit these men? - Well,

663
00:36:06,576 --> 00:36:10,349
they tried to hit me first, so I had no choice.

664
00:36:12,576 --> 00:36:13,644
I'm sorry.

665
00:36:13,645 --> 00:36:16,206
You were really beaten up by a middle school student?

666
00:36:16,956 --> 00:36:19,945
He's not an ordinary middle school student. You should've seen him.

667
00:36:19,985 --> 00:36:21,984
He was practically flying in the air.

668
00:36:21,985 --> 00:36:23,894
Right. But I was only hit a little bit.

669
00:36:23,895 --> 00:36:25,150
- Jun Ki took most of the beating. - What?

670
00:36:25,456 --> 00:36:27,894
That kid pounded Jun Ki's back with his elbows.

671
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:30,834
I wasn't being pounded. I was blocking him with my back.

672
00:36:30,835 --> 00:36:33,935
You were kicked in the solar plexus and were gasping pathetically.

673
00:36:33,936 --> 00:36:35,670
No, I wasn't. I was just catching my breath.

674
00:36:35,866 --> 00:36:37,233
Also, it didn't even hurt that much.

675
00:36:37,306 --> 00:36:38,459
It didn't hurt for me either.

676
00:36:38,675 --> 00:36:40,004
Don't you know I take blows well?

677
00:36:40,005 --> 00:36:42,628
- I'm a man of steel. - Man of steel, my foot.

678
00:36:42,815 --> 00:36:44,172
You got on your knees first.

679
00:36:44,616 --> 00:36:45,845
You started bleeding first.

680
00:36:45,846 --> 00:36:47,214
You started crying first.

681
00:36:47,215 --> 00:36:48,542
You called him "Big Brother Seok Dae" first.

682
00:36:50,786 --> 00:36:53,438
Brother, I'm sorry.

683
00:36:53,686 --> 00:36:54,849
(Quiet!)

684
00:36:56,996 --> 00:37:00,801
(I'm the lunatic for trusting you.)

685
00:37:02,735 --> 00:37:03,990
I said, I'm sorry.

686
00:37:04,436 --> 00:37:05,734
How can I make it up to you?

687
00:37:05,735 --> 00:37:07,031
Tell me anything.

688
00:37:09,636 --> 00:37:10,962
(Really?)

689
00:37:11,235 --> 00:37:13,044
(Hold on.)

690
00:37:13,045 --> 00:37:14,575
Okay, I'll wait.

691
00:37:20,085 --> 00:37:21,820
Woo Shik, what are you looking for?

692
00:37:22,686 --> 00:37:23,941
Do you want me to look for you?

693
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:39,064
Woo Shik, why are you lifting up that broom?

694
00:37:39,065 --> 00:37:40,365
- Come here. - What?

695
00:37:40,366 --> 00:37:41,464
Come here.

696
00:37:41,465 --> 00:37:43,578
- Calm down, Woo Shik. - Come here.

697
00:37:43,706 --> 00:37:44,858
Calm down.

698
00:37:45,105 --> 00:37:46,774
- Come here! - No!

699
00:37:46,775 --> 00:37:48,949
- Come here! - Don't come near me!

700
00:37:51,445 --> 00:37:52,538
- Woo Shik. - Come here.

701
00:38:01,156 --> 00:38:02,584
I feel stuffy.

702
00:38:02,956 --> 00:38:05,954
I said, I feel stuffy. Gosh.

703
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:08,799
What is this? Jun Ki, what is...

704
00:38:10,096 --> 00:38:12,595
What on earth? What is he doing?

705
00:38:12,596 --> 00:38:15,234
Chairman Kim, follow me.

706
00:38:15,235 --> 00:38:19,051
Chairman Kim? What on earth is he dreaming about?

707
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,268
Chairman Kim.

708
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:23,141
Let's begin the backstroke.

709
00:38:25,445 --> 00:38:27,016
You crazy little...

710
00:38:29,456 --> 00:38:32,751
Stop it, you darn lunatic!

711
00:38:34,286 --> 00:38:35,448
That hurts.

712
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:40,719
Ouch, my jaw.

713
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:44,848
How dare she throw a backspin elbow at her brother?

714
00:38:45,065 --> 00:38:46,464
And what? Soo Yeon likes me?

715
00:38:47,005 --> 00:38:49,280
I'm an idiot for believing her again.

716
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:50,895
Brother.

717
00:38:52,005 --> 00:38:54,374
You should have some kimchi.

718
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:57,711
I wouldn't be eating this porridge if I could chew kimchi!

719
00:38:58,315 --> 00:38:59,714
I'm sorry.

720
00:39:00,445 --> 00:39:03,619
By the way, what are you going to do now? With Soo Yeon.

721
00:39:04,156 --> 00:39:05,512
I have no idea.

722
00:39:05,585 --> 00:39:09,325
That being said, I have a brilliant idea to win her heart...

723
00:39:09,326 --> 00:39:10,694
Shut it. Be quiet!

724
00:39:10,695 --> 00:39:12,460
I won't believe anything you say!

725
00:39:15,025 --> 00:39:16,974
- Good grief. - You guys are up.

726
00:39:17,395 --> 00:39:18,415
Good morning.

727
00:39:18,936 --> 00:39:20,064
Do you want some porridge?

728
00:39:20,065 --> 00:39:22,365
You guys probably can't chew either.

729
00:39:22,366 --> 00:39:23,374
It's all right.

730
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:25,734
I saw something I shouldn't have seen, so I lost all my appetite.

731
00:39:25,735 --> 00:39:27,075
Why? What happened?

732
00:39:27,076 --> 00:39:29,774
Before Jun Ki woke up, he went all crazy on the bed,

733
00:39:29,775 --> 00:39:31,615
wearing nothing but his underwear.

734
00:39:31,616 --> 00:39:33,115
What? Why?

735
00:39:33,186 --> 00:39:36,214
The thing is, I had a fascinating dream.

736
00:39:36,215 --> 00:39:37,314
A fascinating dream?

737
00:39:37,315 --> 00:39:38,948
I'll tell you all about it.

738
00:39:40,826 --> 00:39:43,814
In my dream, I was climbing a mountain.

739
00:39:44,226 --> 00:39:46,337
But suddenly, I saw a sign.

740
00:39:46,525 --> 00:39:48,433
"1,000m to the peak of Mount Paektu".

741
00:39:48,895 --> 00:39:51,589
I was climbing Mount Paektu.

742
00:39:52,465 --> 00:39:54,265
I kept climbing...

743
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,104
and finally got to the peak.

744
00:39:56,105 --> 00:39:58,104
- Heaven Lake. - Then the scenery of Heaven Lake...

745
00:39:58,105 --> 00:40:00,829
unfolded right before my eyes.

746
00:40:01,406 --> 00:40:04,506
I took my clothes off, jumped into the lake, and started swimming.

747
00:40:04,545 --> 00:40:06,107
I was having a blast.

748
00:40:06,416 --> 00:40:09,781
I swam freestyle, did the butterfly stroke and the backstroke.

749
00:40:10,315 --> 00:40:11,540
And right at that moment...

750
00:40:13,925 --> 00:40:14,977
My gosh.

751
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:19,717
Chairman Kim?

752
00:40:25,395 --> 00:40:26,864
- What? - Oh, sure.

753
00:40:27,766 --> 00:40:30,035
You mean, Chairman Kim in the North? You saw him in your dream?

754
00:40:30,036 --> 00:40:31,464
Yes, that's right.

755
00:40:31,576 --> 00:40:33,504
In Heaven Lake, he and I...

756
00:40:33,505 --> 00:40:35,874
swam together, and I even scrubbed his back for him.

757
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:37,344
I had such a great time.

758
00:40:37,576 --> 00:40:39,106
It's so cool, isn't it?

759
00:40:39,215 --> 00:40:40,337
It is cool indeed.

760
00:40:40,545 --> 00:40:43,851
I heard seeing a famous person in your dream brings you good luck.

761
00:40:43,855 --> 00:40:45,584
Does it mean something good will happen to you?

762
00:40:45,585 --> 00:40:48,309
That's just a superstition. I don't believe in things like that.

763
00:40:49,056 --> 00:40:51,124
Jun Ki, then just sell the dream to me.

764
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:52,553
- You want me to sell you my dream? - Yes.

765
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:54,165
Nothing's been going my way.

766
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:56,308
Maybe your lucky dream will help me.

767
00:40:56,395 --> 00:40:57,896
- My lucky dream? - Hang on a second.

768
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:01,064
Here, I'll give you 10 dollars for it.

769
00:41:01,065 --> 00:41:02,165
- Seriously? - Yes.

770
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:04,205
- Deal! - Nice. So you sold it to me.

771
00:41:04,206 --> 00:41:05,256
Okay.

772
00:41:05,306 --> 00:41:06,703
Score, free money.

773
00:41:07,346 --> 00:41:08,499
(10 dollars)

774
00:41:08,505 --> 00:41:09,774
10 dollars.

775
00:41:09,775 --> 00:41:11,203
(Dreams Come True)

776
00:41:17,755 --> 00:41:20,235
Nice pitch!

777
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,424
Hey, Ki Bong! Let's take a quick break.

778
00:41:22,425 --> 00:41:23,955
Okay, great work!

779
00:41:24,596 --> 00:41:26,972
Guys, gather around!

780
00:41:27,395 --> 00:41:29,160
- Okay! - I have an announcement to make.

781
00:41:30,295 --> 00:41:32,306
The coach from the major league called me.

782
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:33,964
Many of their players are injured,

783
00:41:33,965 --> 00:41:35,536
so they need a replacement right away.

784
00:41:35,706 --> 00:41:38,174
The coach would like to...

785
00:41:38,175 --> 00:41:39,674
test you guys himself tomorrow,

786
00:41:39,675 --> 00:41:41,305
so be fully prepared. Got it?

787
00:41:41,306 --> 00:41:42,396
- Yes! - Yes!

788
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:46,138
A test to join the major league?

789
00:41:47,045 --> 00:41:48,065
Nice.

790
00:41:51,156 --> 00:41:52,686
I feel so bad that you can't even eat pizza.

791
00:41:53,286 --> 00:41:54,685
Does your jaw still hurt a lot?

792
00:41:54,686 --> 00:41:56,725
No, I'm fine.

793
00:41:56,726 --> 00:41:58,939
Why did you bother Yu Ri and provoke her to hit you?

794
00:41:59,395 --> 00:42:01,194
Don't bother her from now on.

795
00:42:01,195 --> 00:42:03,786
Okay, I won't.

796
00:42:04,895 --> 00:42:07,205
This is so good. How can it be this delicious?

797
00:42:07,206 --> 00:42:09,858
Right? It tastes even better because it was bought with free money.

798
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:12,975
Hey. Eat slowly, or your stomach will get upset.

799
00:42:12,976 --> 00:42:14,245
I don't have time.

800
00:42:14,246 --> 00:42:15,805
I have to eat quickly and head out for my shift.

801
00:42:15,806 --> 00:42:17,142
You have another shift?

802
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:20,037
How many part-time jobs do you have?

803
00:42:20,116 --> 00:42:21,412
Have you given up on acting?

804
00:42:23,255 --> 00:42:25,455
Acting? Jung Eun is into acting?

805
00:42:25,456 --> 00:42:26,524
You didn't know?

806
00:42:26,525 --> 00:42:29,055
We both majored in Theater and Film Studies.

807
00:42:29,056 --> 00:42:31,924
We used to shoot films and dramas together.

808
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:32,986
Seriously?

809
00:42:33,395 --> 00:42:34,896
How come you're no longer pursuing acting?

810
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,329
Well, I had a bit of a situation.

811
00:42:39,395 --> 00:42:41,374
I should get ready for my shift.

812
00:42:42,136 --> 00:42:43,808
Hey, finish your pizza first.

813
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:48,245
Hey, guys!

814
00:42:48,246 --> 00:42:49,501
I have big news.

815
00:42:49,576 --> 00:42:50,943
What is it? What happened?

816
00:42:51,516 --> 00:42:53,586
I have an evaluation tomorrow for possibly joining the major league.

817
00:42:54,145 --> 00:42:57,084
If I pass it, I may be able to join the major league again.

818
00:42:57,085 --> 00:42:59,115
Really? That's great.

819
00:42:59,116 --> 00:43:03,645
I know, right? But I think it's all because of Jun Ki's dream I bought.

820
00:43:03,726 --> 00:43:07,064
The test got scheduled out of the blue as soon as I bought the dream.

821
00:43:07,065 --> 00:43:09,513
Hey, how can it be because of the dream? That's nonsense.

822
00:43:09,565 --> 00:43:11,694
It's not nonsense. Don't you know the story?

823
00:43:11,695 --> 00:43:12,964
General Kim Yu Shin's sister...

824
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,904
bought her elder sister's dream and became a queen.

825
00:43:15,266 --> 00:43:18,877
Right, many people win the lottery after having a good dream.

826
00:43:19,406 --> 00:43:21,793
- What? - Jun Ki, you must be jealous.

827
00:43:21,906 --> 00:43:24,190
You sold your lucky dream for just 10 dollars.

828
00:43:27,145 --> 00:43:29,227
Hey, give back my dream.

829
00:43:29,386 --> 00:43:31,754
I'll give you back your 10 dollars. I want my dream back.

830
00:43:31,755 --> 00:43:33,725
No way. You sold it to me, so you can't get it back.

831
00:43:34,355 --> 00:43:35,984
Then I'll give you 20 dollars.

832
00:43:35,985 --> 00:43:37,046
Not a chance.

833
00:43:37,226 --> 00:43:39,294
Well, I should go wash up.

834
00:43:39,295 --> 00:43:41,624
Hey, that's my dream. Hey, wait.

835
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:43,194
- I'll give you 30 dollars. - Forget it.

836
00:43:43,195 --> 00:43:45,439
50 dollars, then. Give it back, please.

837
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:49,754
Be gentle, will you?

838
00:43:50,371 --> 00:43:51,492
I'm sorry.

839
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:55,640
It's done. Do you want one more?

840
00:43:55,641 --> 00:43:58,058
No, it's fine. What is this mess, seriously?

841
00:43:58,481 --> 00:44:00,049
Hey, it's my dream.

842
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:02,609
Give it back! Give me back my dream.

843
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,661
Gosh! Enough, you idiot.

844
00:44:05,081 --> 00:44:07,020
Are you two still fighting over that dream?

845
00:44:07,021 --> 00:44:09,819
Don't even get me started. He nagged me all night to sell it back.

846
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:12,120
It's my dream, so give it back already.

847
00:44:12,121 --> 00:44:13,213
I don't want to.

848
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,178
All right, shall I have my breakfast now?

849
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,953
Gosh, seriously.

850
00:44:18,501 --> 00:44:19,724
- All right. - Darn it.

851
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:21,090
What's that?

852
00:44:21,731 --> 00:44:23,239
- Gimbap. - Oh, gimbap?

853
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,729
Hey, I want some too.

854
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:28,592
- What's this stench? - Hey.

855
00:44:28,911 --> 00:44:30,179
It's gone bad.

856
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,609
Really? That's good.

857
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,933
Let me see.

858
00:44:34,481 --> 00:44:36,867
Oh, my. It's really gone bad.

859
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:39,219
Goodness, here we go again.

860
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,390
"Again"? What do you mean?

861
00:44:40,391 --> 00:44:43,089
Ki Bong has to eat gimbap that's gone bad...

862
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:44,890
whenever he has an important game or test.

863
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:46,730
What? What kind of superstition is this?

864
00:44:46,731 --> 00:44:49,006
All right, shall I eat my breakfast now?

865
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,230
My gosh, this gimbap tastes like fermented skate.

866
00:44:56,231 --> 00:44:57,260
It's good.

867
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,370
You greedy jerk.

868
00:44:59,371 --> 00:45:02,609
You can count on this superstition, so give back my dream already!

869
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:04,410
What? I can't hear you.

870
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:05,503
What?

871
00:45:06,081 --> 00:45:07,478
Gosh, it smells like warm garbage.

872
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,446
- Hello. - Hi.

873
00:45:20,061 --> 00:45:22,611
Nice, here comes the signal.

874
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,216
This feels exactly like the time...

875
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:28,336
when I pitched a shutout.

876
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:30,523
Good.

877
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:35,862
Hey, good to see you.

878
00:45:37,981 --> 00:45:39,062
Hello, Won Ho.

879
00:45:39,981 --> 00:45:41,480
What on earth are you doing now?

880
00:45:41,811 --> 00:45:43,208
Oh, this?

881
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,464
You didn't know? That's his superstition.

882
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:48,819
He has to wear pantyhose before a game or a test...

883
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,219
to throw a breaking ball.

884
00:45:50,421 --> 00:45:53,190
It's one ridiculous superstition. He always makes such a fuss.

885
00:45:53,191 --> 00:45:54,925
- Hey, we should get ready. - Okay.

886
00:45:56,731 --> 00:45:58,393
(Son Hyun Woo)

887
00:46:00,831 --> 00:46:04,340
(Gwak Ha Ni)

888
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,584
- Ki Bong, you're early today. - Hello, Ha Ni.

889
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:10,310
Ki Bong, you're early today.

890
00:46:10,311 --> 00:46:13,748
Don't be surprised. He has to do everything four times.

891
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:16,279
Good luck today, Ki Bong.

892
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,080
- Good luck to you... - Good luck today, Ki Bong.

893
00:46:18,081 --> 00:46:20,570
Good luck today, Ki Bong.

894
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,750
Thank you.

895
00:46:22,751 --> 00:46:24,660
I don't have to answer four times, right?

896
00:46:24,661 --> 00:46:28,560
I'd appreciate it if you did.

897
00:46:28,561 --> 00:46:29,611
Enough!

898
00:46:31,561 --> 00:46:33,815
Okay.

899
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:36,500
Let's go.

900
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:42,814
- Hey, why are you so chipper? - What?

901
00:46:42,941 --> 00:46:43,980
Earlier,

902
00:46:43,981 --> 00:46:46,256
you were going crazy saying Ki Bong wouldn't sell your dream back.

903
00:46:47,211 --> 00:46:48,435
I bought the dream back.

904
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:50,383
Really? How?

905
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,516
(For the dream)

906
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,989
Ki Bong, why do you have money on your back?

907
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:56,144
What? Money?

908
00:46:56,521 --> 00:46:57,949
(Kook Ki Bong, For the dream)

909
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,280
Here, look.

910
00:46:59,391 --> 00:47:01,022
What? What is this?

911
00:47:01,061 --> 00:47:02,660
- For the dream. - "For the dream"?

912
00:47:02,661 --> 00:47:03,782
What dream?

913
00:47:04,461 --> 00:47:06,644
Lee Jun Ki, that jerk...

914
00:47:08,831 --> 00:47:10,268
- Hello. - Attention, everyone.

915
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,066
I'm really sorry.

916
00:47:12,171 --> 00:47:14,810
Something's come up for the coach, so he needs to...

917
00:47:14,811 --> 00:47:16,402
move the test to tomorrow.

918
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:20,449
So just carry on with your normal training routine today, okay?

919
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:21,674
- Got it. - Got it.

920
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,103
It's postponed?

921
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,312
Why all of a sudden?

922
00:47:27,021 --> 00:47:28,276
Gosh, my stomach.

923
00:47:30,161 --> 00:47:31,181
Hold on.

924
00:47:31,561 --> 00:47:33,631
Is this happening because he took the dream back?

925
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:36,947
Lee Jun Ki, that jerk. How dare he!

926
00:47:38,101 --> 00:47:40,784
Anyway, so I bought the dream back, got it?

927
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:42,756
Whatever, dude. Bye!

928
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,912
He's steaming mad.

929
00:47:46,941 --> 00:47:48,063
Who is this?

930
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:49,490
Hello.

931
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,300
What?

932
00:47:51,711 --> 00:47:52,810
Really?

933
00:47:52,811 --> 00:47:54,412
Of course! I'd love it.

934
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,238
Thanks.

935
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,949
What's going on?

936
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:00,297
I just got called in for the audition...

937
00:48:00,421 --> 00:48:02,089
- I badly wanted. - Really?

938
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:03,315
It must be my lucky day.

939
00:48:04,521 --> 00:48:05,643
Hold on a second.

940
00:48:06,021 --> 00:48:07,259
- Hey. - What?

941
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,230
Is this happening because of that dream?

942
00:48:09,231 --> 00:48:12,159
- The dream you bought back? - Yes.

943
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,199
I got invited to the audition right after I bought the dream from him.

944
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,395
That's true.

945
00:48:16,501 --> 00:48:18,399
It is because of the dream.

946
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,074
It is an auspicious dream as I expected.

947
00:48:21,671 --> 00:48:22,895
You go ahead.

948
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,167
What about you, comrade?

949
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:28,203
- Let's run away together. - We don't have enough time.

950
00:48:28,351 --> 00:48:30,217
You should save yourself, at least.

951
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,697
If you live, that will be enough for me.

952
00:48:34,621 --> 00:48:37,660
You are right here, my dear comrade.

953
00:48:37,661 --> 00:48:39,904
Comrade, I love...

954
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:42,083
I love...

955
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,660
I can't do this! I can't!

956
00:48:44,661 --> 00:48:46,330
It's way too cheesy.

957
00:48:46,331 --> 00:48:49,000
- Be serious, would you? - It makes me cringe.

958
00:48:49,001 --> 00:48:50,239
Forget it!

959
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,669
- Never mind! - Whatever!

960
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,485
- I'm home. - Jung Eun!

961
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:57,640
What took you so long? I almost died waiting for you.

962
00:48:57,641 --> 00:48:59,477
What on earth? What are you scheming this time?

963
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:03,310
I have an audition tomorrow. Can you read with me?

964
00:49:03,311 --> 00:49:04,401
Sorry?

965
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,790
No. I just got off work. I'm too tired.

966
00:49:07,791 --> 00:49:09,620
Hey, don't be like that.

967
00:49:09,621 --> 00:49:10,947
Hey! Help a friend a little.

968
00:49:11,121 --> 00:49:12,793
Just read with me for a bit!

969
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:19,199
That was so mean. She puts work over friends.

970
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,721
She can be so money hungry.

971
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,023
My goodness!

972
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,912
What on earth are you doing? You startled me!

973
00:49:27,411 --> 00:49:30,543
- How did the test go? - It's postponed. It's tomorrow.

974
00:49:31,311 --> 00:49:33,044
It's all your fault, you punk.

975
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:35,379
What? How is that my fault?

976
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:38,848
The moment you snatched my dream, my test got postponed.

977
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:42,219
So give me back my dream. Right now!

978
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:44,770
Okay. I'll give it back.

979
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,044
Why don't you dream another one?

980
00:49:46,421 --> 00:49:47,511
Lee Jun Ki!

981
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,460
Hey. What's wrong with you?

982
00:49:53,461 --> 00:49:56,357
My stomach. It hurts so much.

983
00:49:57,871 --> 00:50:01,370
It's no surprise after you ate the gimbap that had gone bad.

984
00:50:01,371 --> 00:50:03,177
- Go to the bathroom already! - No!

985
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:07,255
I never went to the bathroom when I pitched a shutout.

986
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:10,149
I don't want to jinx it by going to the bathroom now.

987
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:13,762
You mean you won't go to the bathroom until tomorrow?

988
00:50:13,791 --> 00:50:14,819
Of course!

989
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:17,120
I already lost my dream to Jun Ki. I can't afford to jinx it.

990
00:50:17,121 --> 00:50:18,518
Otherwise, I might fail the test.

991
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:20,890
I have to make it to the major league this time.

992
00:50:20,891 --> 00:50:23,134
I'm going to make it no matter what.

993
00:50:25,061 --> 00:50:26,151
Not now.

994
00:50:28,371 --> 00:50:29,492
Okay.

995
00:50:35,911 --> 00:50:37,310
What are you doing?

996
00:50:37,311 --> 00:50:40,748
This would make them go back up.

997
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:43,580
You really are an idiot, aren't you?

998
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,023
All done.

999
00:51:05,441 --> 00:51:06,593
I'm so beat.

1000
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:20,292
How many part-time jobs do you have?

1001
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:21,847
Have you given up on acting?

1002
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:30,285
You are right here, my dear comrade.

1003
00:51:31,501 --> 00:51:33,776
You are right here... Darn.

1004
00:51:34,371 --> 00:51:36,063
Why can't I focus?

1005
00:51:36,501 --> 00:51:37,562
Oh my gosh!

1006
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,870
Are you still doing this?

1007
00:51:39,871 --> 00:51:41,268
It's all your fault.

1008
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:43,910
So give me back my dream. Give it back already!

1009
00:51:43,911 --> 00:51:46,257
- I don't think so! - Stop there!

1010
00:51:46,411 --> 00:51:47,480
That little...

1011
00:51:47,481 --> 00:51:49,490
Lee Jun Ki! You jerk!

1012
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,751
- You... - Cut it out.

1013
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,149
Stop following me around.

1014
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:54,319
Quit bothering me.

1015
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,759
Then give me back my dream. Right now!

1016
00:51:57,961 --> 00:51:59,989
I have to go up to the major league!

1017
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,890
I have to pass this audition!

1018
00:52:01,891 --> 00:52:04,756
It was my dream to begin with!

1019
00:52:04,831 --> 00:52:07,482
You sold it to me!

1020
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,500
So I gave you the money back!

1021
00:52:10,501 --> 00:52:11,562
You little punk.

1022
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:15,969
Stop yammering and just give me back my dream!

1023
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:18,286
Did you just put your feet around my neck?

1024
00:52:18,311 --> 00:52:20,350
This is how you want to play it?

1025
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:23,609
Yes, let's see if you can handle it.

1026
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:25,926
We'll see the end of this tonight.

1027
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,172
Goodness!

1028
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:30,460
Give it back! Give my dream back!

1029
00:52:30,461 --> 00:52:32,328
Give it!

1030
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,923
What?

1031
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:43,124
Where am I?

1032
00:52:46,541 --> 00:52:48,173
I guess I dozed off while cleaning.

1033
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,300
What is it?

1034
00:52:52,411 --> 00:52:53,532
What is that sound?

1035
00:52:59,351 --> 00:53:01,023
What's that old man doing there?

1036
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:03,243
What time is it?

1037
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,414
It's already five?

1038
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:08,642
Then they opened the shop already.

1039
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:10,183
Oh, no.

1040
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:12,960
Oh well.

1041
00:53:12,961 --> 00:53:15,787
I have to sneak out when it's not too crowded yet.

1042
00:53:35,521 --> 00:53:36,643
Darn it!

1043
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,444
Goodness. It's driving me crazy.

1044
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,086
When will they start it?

1045
00:53:56,041 --> 00:54:00,121
This is all because of that jerk, Lee Jun Ki.

1046
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:04,520
You are right here, my dear comrade.

1047
00:54:04,521 --> 00:54:05,719
(A Peacock by Taedong River, Audition)

1048
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:06,903
You are right here, my dear comrade.

1049
00:54:07,121 --> 00:54:09,671
You are right here, my dear comrade.

1050
00:54:10,521 --> 00:54:13,755
- Hi, guys. How's everyone? - Hello, sir.

1051
00:54:14,731 --> 00:54:16,029
- Hello. - Hello.

1052
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:18,070
You brought your own costume?

1053
00:54:19,161 --> 00:54:22,230
Yes, sir. I prepared it to get into my character.

1054
00:54:22,231 --> 00:54:24,280
What a great attitude.

1055
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:25,932
See you at the audition then.

1056
00:54:26,371 --> 00:54:27,463
Break a leg.

1057
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:29,193
Thank you.

1058
00:54:29,671 --> 00:54:30,802
Thank you.

1059
00:54:32,911 --> 00:54:35,910
Everything is going so well.

1060
00:54:36,981 --> 00:54:40,285
I said it was an auspicious dream.

1061
00:54:41,521 --> 00:54:43,081
All right.

1062
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,874
Next! Kook Ki Bong!

1063
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:56,458
Where is Kook Ki Bong?

1064
00:54:58,340 --> 00:54:59,392
I'm here, sir.

1065
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,739
Hey, what's wrong? Are you sick?

1066
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,383
No, sir. I'm fine.

1067
00:55:12,521 --> 00:55:15,816
I'm almost there.

1068
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:18,534
Ki Bong, hold in for just a little more.

1069
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,453
- Just a little more... - Who's the next batter?

1070
00:55:20,791 --> 00:55:21,953
That's me, coach.

1071
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,100
(Gwak Ha Ni)

1072
00:55:26,101 --> 00:55:28,518
That's me.

1073
00:55:28,601 --> 00:55:31,192
I'm playing against Ha Ni?

1074
00:55:32,101 --> 00:55:33,222
Darn it.

1075
00:55:35,311 --> 00:55:37,759
- Next, Lee Jun Ki? - Yes, sir.

1076
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,480
Don't be nervous, Jun Ki.

1077
00:55:43,481 --> 00:55:44,980
You'll get it this time.

1078
00:55:45,581 --> 00:55:47,223
You practiced so much, no doubt about it.

1079
00:55:47,291 --> 00:55:48,546
And I also had the auspicious dream.

1080
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:50,212
Let's do this.

1081
00:55:50,351 --> 00:55:51,718
Let's get it!

1082
00:55:59,831 --> 00:56:03,196
Why does it have to be Ha Ni of all people?

1083
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,301
Why does he take so long to warm up?

1084
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,343
My goodness, what do I do?

1085
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:45,552
All right. Let's figure this out.

1086
00:56:46,211 --> 00:56:49,883
The longest I can hold it in is maybe two minutes.

1087
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:53,132
Assuming that he'll take about 30 seconds each time...

1088
00:56:53,751 --> 00:56:57,157
If I strike him out, it'll be 1 minute 30 seconds.

1089
00:56:57,521 --> 00:57:00,417
With 30 seconds to run to the toilet, the total will be 2 minutes.

1090
00:57:00,731 --> 00:57:03,240
That's it. I can do this in two minutes.

1091
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:07,069
I must strike him out no matter what.

1092
00:57:07,101 --> 00:57:08,254
Three strikes!

1093
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:11,603
Come on! Throw the ball!

1094
00:57:18,911 --> 00:57:20,032
Okay, strike!

1095
00:57:24,521 --> 00:57:26,969
My gosh, does he have to repeat that too?

1096
00:57:28,521 --> 00:57:31,489
- Hey, we don't have all day! - Right away, coach.

1097
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:33,562
I'll hurry, sir.

1098
00:57:33,661 --> 00:57:34,712
I'm sorry.

1099
00:57:37,191 --> 00:57:39,240
Okay, four times, is it?

1100
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:50,174
Throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it.

1101
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:54,881
Okay! Two strikes!

1102
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:02,642
I held it in.

1103
00:58:03,891 --> 00:58:05,349
Hurry up, already!

1104
00:58:09,731 --> 00:58:10,853
I can't stand it any longer.

1105
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:15,019
I have to finish it with this pitch no matter what.

1106
00:58:15,331 --> 00:58:16,529
No matter what.

1107
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:19,529
Come on, throw it. Throw it.

1108
00:58:33,607 --> 00:58:36,166
Ki Bong, are you on your way home from training?

1109
00:58:36,477 --> 00:58:38,215
How did the test go? Did you pass?

1110
00:58:38,216 --> 00:58:39,574
I failed. Why?

1111
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:43,828
The batter hit a home run, and I failed.

1112
00:58:46,587 --> 00:58:48,086
This is all your fault, you jerk.

1113
00:58:48,127 --> 00:58:51,431
It's because you bought that lucky dream back!

1114
00:58:52,727 --> 00:58:54,267
Why is it my fault?

1115
00:58:54,737 --> 00:58:56,535
Forget that darn lucky dream.

1116
00:58:56,536 --> 00:58:57,761
I failed too.

1117
00:58:58,667 --> 00:59:00,371
What? You too?

1118
00:59:00,437 --> 00:59:01,498
Yes.

1119
00:59:01,737 --> 00:59:02,976
It was my turn to audition...

1120
00:59:02,977 --> 00:59:05,292
and I opened the door confidently as I entered...

1121
00:59:05,846 --> 00:59:08,530
but the director got hit by the door on his way out and he fainted.

1122
00:59:08,616 --> 00:59:10,675
Anyway, I messed up too.

1123
00:59:10,676 --> 00:59:12,278
How could you be so unfortunate?

1124
00:59:13,547 --> 00:59:14,608
Wait a minute.

1125
00:59:14,987 --> 00:59:17,115
Then that wasn't an auspicious dream?

1126
00:59:17,116 --> 00:59:18,986
Auspicious dream, my foot.

1127
00:59:18,987 --> 00:59:21,155
That was just a stupid, silly dream!

1128
00:59:21,156 --> 00:59:23,135
Shut up. Let's just go home.

1129
00:59:25,096 --> 00:59:27,820
Hey, I have someplace I have to drop by.

1130
00:59:27,866 --> 00:59:28,959
Drop by?

1131
00:59:29,696 --> 00:59:30,695
Where?

1132
00:59:30,696 --> 00:59:31,860
(Men's Bath)

1133
00:59:34,576 --> 00:59:36,616
Hey, why did you suddenly want to come take a bath?

1134
00:59:37,477 --> 00:59:38,976
Don't ask anything.

1135
00:59:39,176 --> 00:59:41,215
It might hurt you if you find out.

1136
00:59:41,216 --> 00:59:43,797
Whatever, forget it. I don't even want to know.

1137
00:59:45,946 --> 00:59:47,793
I'll go cool myself down.

1138
00:59:51,027 --> 00:59:54,627
Oh, gosh. This feels so nice.

1139
00:59:56,656 --> 00:59:59,452
Why is nothing going my way lately?

1140
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:02,617
And what on earth was that dream?

1141
01:00:04,966 --> 01:00:06,058
Whatever.

1142
01:00:06,306 --> 01:00:07,704
I'll take a swim.

1143
01:00:10,377 --> 01:00:11,467
This feels so good.

1144
01:00:18,417 --> 01:00:19,640
Oh, my goodness!

1145
01:00:19,946 --> 01:00:21,415
Jung Eun, were you swimming in here too?

1146
01:00:21,457 --> 01:00:23,190
Hold on. What's going on?

1147
01:00:23,516 --> 01:00:24,914
Why are you in here?

1148
01:00:25,487 --> 01:00:27,285
Why are you in the men's bath?

1149
01:00:27,286 --> 01:00:30,521
The thing is, I was working part-time to clean up in here,

1150
01:00:30,656 --> 01:00:32,526
and I fell asleep.

1151
01:00:32,527 --> 01:00:34,159
- What? - Jun Ki.

1152
01:00:34,266 --> 01:00:35,971
Can you take me out of here?

1153
01:00:36,897 --> 01:00:38,804
I'm freezing to death.

1154
01:00:39,036 --> 01:00:41,876
Gosh, Kim Jung Eun, how could you be so...

1155
01:00:41,877 --> 01:00:43,234
Back up, back up.

1156
01:00:44,237 --> 01:00:45,808
Kim... Kim Jung Eun?

1157
01:00:46,346 --> 01:00:47,366
Kim Jung Eun?

1158
01:00:47,716 --> 01:00:48,798
Kim Jung Eun?

1159
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:50,968
Chairman Kim?

1160
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:54,240
Then was that dream...

1161
01:00:56,687 --> 01:00:57,779
Wait a minute.

1162
01:00:58,457 --> 01:00:59,610
Heaven Lake Sauna?

1163
01:01:00,426 --> 01:01:01,478
Wait.

1164
01:01:01,826 --> 01:01:02,919
"Heaven Lake".

1165
01:01:03,227 --> 01:01:05,409
Then was that dream about this?

1166
01:01:07,067 --> 01:01:08,627
Darn it!

1167
01:01:08,837 --> 01:01:10,162
Seriously!

1168
01:01:13,036 --> 01:01:14,434
This is so funny.

1169
01:01:15,107 --> 01:01:16,135
What?

1170
01:01:16,136 --> 01:01:18,006
You mean that Kim Jung Eun...

1171
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:20,506
wasn't that man in the north but her,

1172
01:01:20,507 --> 01:01:22,845
and it wasn't Mount Paektu but a sauna?

1173
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:24,142
Yes, I'm telling you.

1174
01:01:24,846 --> 01:01:28,316
This brat Jung Eun is no use to my life at all.

1175
01:01:28,317 --> 01:01:30,486
Stop it. Do you think I did it on purpose or what?

1176
01:01:30,487 --> 01:01:34,362
How much money did you need, working part-time all day like that?

1177
01:01:34,527 --> 01:01:37,555
It seems like she's totally obsessed with money.

1178
01:01:37,556 --> 01:01:38,689
I said, stop it!

1179
01:01:44,297 --> 01:01:45,736
What's wrong with her?

1180
01:01:45,737 --> 01:01:47,981
What do you think? It's because of you.

1181
01:01:48,237 --> 01:01:50,318
You never know when to stop, do you?

1182
01:02:02,417 --> 01:02:03,437
What are you doing here?

1183
01:02:05,156 --> 01:02:06,452
I'm sorry.

1184
01:02:07,127 --> 01:02:09,226
I was a bit harsh just now.

1185
01:02:09,227 --> 01:02:12,052
- Forget it. - You should work less.

1186
01:02:12,527 --> 01:02:15,658
You're losing sleep and suffering, which has eventually led to this.

1187
01:02:16,636 --> 01:02:18,166
Do you really need that much money?

1188
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:19,606
It's not because of the money.

1189
01:02:19,607 --> 01:02:21,545
Then why are you being so hard on yourself?

1190
01:02:21,607 --> 01:02:22,932
In case I want to do it again.

1191
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:25,299
In case I get my hopes up again.

1192
01:02:26,346 --> 01:02:27,398
On what?

1193
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:29,469
Acting.

1194
01:02:30,477 --> 01:02:32,515
Then you can just start acting again.

1195
01:02:32,516 --> 01:02:33,638
Actually...

1196
01:02:34,656 --> 01:02:35,942
I gave up on acting.

1197
01:02:37,357 --> 01:02:40,086
You know too that I don't have much talent in acting.

1198
01:02:40,087 --> 01:02:41,423
What are you talking about?

1199
01:02:42,397 --> 01:02:44,296
You have so much experience...

1200
01:02:44,297 --> 01:02:45,520
You want me to keep going?

1201
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:47,148
But what if you're wrong?

1202
01:02:47,766 --> 01:02:49,328
What if I keep doing it, and fail?

1203
01:02:50,466 --> 01:02:51,935
That's what scared me...

1204
01:02:52,837 --> 01:02:53,887
and made me anxious,

1205
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,029
and I couldn't handle it anymore.

1206
01:02:58,977 --> 01:03:00,171
That's why I gave up.

1207
01:03:02,116 --> 01:03:03,197
So?

1208
01:03:04,817 --> 01:03:06,582
Do you feel more comfortable after giving up?

1209
01:03:07,716 --> 01:03:08,778
You don't.

1210
01:03:09,656 --> 01:03:10,676
It's tougher.

1211
01:03:11,656 --> 01:03:12,779
Am I wrong?

1212
01:03:16,297 --> 01:03:17,347
You're right.

1213
01:03:18,027 --> 01:03:19,801
I keep auditioning when nothing is guaranteed,

1214
01:03:20,167 --> 01:03:21,932
and doing minor roles without even a single line.

1215
01:03:22,667 --> 01:03:24,400
I feel anxious, and it tires me out.

1216
01:03:25,306 --> 01:03:26,795
But do you know why I don't give up?

1217
01:03:28,536 --> 01:03:30,066
Because things will get more difficult if I give up.

1218
01:03:31,547 --> 01:03:33,484
I know doing something that I don't want to do...

1219
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:35,614
is a hundred times more difficult.

1220
01:03:37,277 --> 01:03:38,306
Jung Eun.

1221
01:03:39,587 --> 01:03:42,575
If you know it's going to be tough whether you give up or not,

1222
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:45,399
isn't it better to suffer while doing something you like?

1223
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:50,245
I don't know if it's because I'm stupid, but that seems right.

1224
01:03:51,797 --> 01:03:52,887
Maybe it's not.

1225
01:03:54,596 --> 01:03:56,228
I better go down and grab something to eat.

1226
01:03:56,897 --> 01:03:59,253
You should come down too. See you.

1227
01:04:11,446 --> 01:04:13,282
Hey, Jun Ki! Wait for me.

1228
01:04:13,346 --> 01:04:14,540
- What? - Wait for me.

1229
01:04:15,016 --> 01:04:16,615
Are you going to hand out your profile?

1230
01:04:16,616 --> 01:04:19,226
Yes. I heard there are several auditions for new movies.

1231
01:04:19,227 --> 01:04:21,808
Really? Then I want to go with you.

1232
01:04:21,857 --> 01:04:23,428
What? Go with me?

1233
01:04:26,766 --> 01:04:29,236
Does that mean you're starting acting again?

1234
01:04:29,237 --> 01:04:30,287
What?

1235
01:04:30,667 --> 01:04:31,963
Well...

1236
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:34,506
I don't know if it's because I'm stupid,

1237
01:04:34,507 --> 01:04:35,934
but what you said sounded right.

1238
01:04:36,277 --> 01:04:38,845
I'm going to suffer anyway, so it would be better...

1239
01:04:38,846 --> 01:04:40,274
to do something I like at least.

1240
01:04:42,777 --> 01:04:45,745
I guess dumb people like us just have to work harder, right?

1241
01:04:46,346 --> 01:04:47,571
Do you have your profile?

1242
01:04:47,716 --> 01:04:48,910
Of course.

1243
01:04:50,187 --> 01:04:51,554
What are those? Flyers?

1244
01:04:54,227 --> 01:04:55,757
Gosh, what on earth is this?

1245
01:04:55,996 --> 01:04:58,026
Please, this will never work.

1246
01:04:58,027 --> 01:05:00,781
Oh, my! No, this looks terrible.

1247
01:05:00,866 --> 01:05:03,836
What is up with this pose? Are we in the 80s or what?

1248
01:05:03,837 --> 01:05:05,438
It's an old photo from before.

1249
01:05:05,966 --> 01:05:08,527
Still, don't I look sexy?

1250
01:05:09,477 --> 01:05:10,497
Sexy?

1251
01:05:10,676 --> 01:05:14,006
Sexy? How could you call this sexy?

1252
01:05:14,007 --> 01:05:15,781
Do you even know the definition of sexy?

1253
01:05:15,917 --> 01:05:17,885
Your face looks like some rotten dumpling.

1254
01:05:17,886 --> 01:05:18,906
Dumpling?

1255
01:05:19,016 --> 01:05:21,566
Hey. I told you not to call me by that nickname.

1256
01:05:23,257 --> 01:05:25,155
I'm sorry, Dumpling. No, I'm sorry, Jung Eun.

1257
01:05:25,156 --> 01:05:27,094
You little punk. Come here.

1258
01:05:27,227 --> 01:05:29,400
I told you not to call me that!

1259
01:05:30,227 --> 01:05:32,573
Hold on. You cute little dumpling.

1260
01:05:35,496 --> 01:05:36,557
Dumpling.

1261
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:41,599
Come here, Dumpling.

1262
01:05:48,746 --> 01:05:51,225
(Welcome to Waikiki 2 / Eulachacha Waikiki 2)

1263
01:05:52,216 --> 01:05:54,316
It's been so long. Do you think I can do this?

1264
01:05:54,317 --> 01:05:55,715
What is your name?

1265
01:05:55,716 --> 01:05:58,126
My name is...

1266
01:05:58,127 --> 01:05:59,555
Are you okay? Were you scared?

1267
01:05:59,556 --> 01:06:01,356
What's wrong with your friend? You said she was good at acting.

1268
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:02,626
Do you mean Jung Eun has been fired?

1269
01:06:02,627 --> 01:06:03,796
What? A blind date?

1270
01:06:03,797 --> 01:06:06,296
He said he'd teach me the forkball if I introduce you to him.

1271
01:06:06,297 --> 01:06:07,825
Oh, my. He's handsome.

1272
01:06:07,826 --> 01:06:09,632
He's my ideal type.

1273
01:06:09,766 --> 01:06:12,459
Why does he make that sound when he laughs?

1274
01:06:12,567 --> 01:06:15,476
I heard Soo Yeon's ideal type is a nice guy.

1275
01:06:15,477 --> 01:06:17,175
- A nice guy? - Woo Shik, teach me how to sing.

1276
01:06:17,176 --> 01:06:19,452
You must not get angry in front of Soo Yeon.

1277
01:06:19,846 --> 01:06:22,875
Firefly light on that day

1278
01:06:22,876 --> 01:06:25,233
Stop singing! Han Soo Yeon!
