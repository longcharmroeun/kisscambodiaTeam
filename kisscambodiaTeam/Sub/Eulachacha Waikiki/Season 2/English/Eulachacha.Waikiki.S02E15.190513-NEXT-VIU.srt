1
00:00:16,923 --> 00:00:18,248
Come closer.

2
00:00:18,523 --> 00:00:19,961
Yes, Your Majesty.

3
00:00:26,373 --> 00:00:29,502
What did I say our relationship was?

4
00:00:29,503 --> 00:00:31,410
You said I was a man who was your friend.

5
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:34,041
In short, a male friend, Your Majesty.

6
00:00:34,042 --> 00:00:35,195
I did say that.

7
00:00:35,712 --> 00:00:36,803
But...

8
00:00:37,543 --> 00:00:41,592
Now, you feel like more than a male friend. What should I do?

9
00:00:43,653 --> 00:00:45,152
- Sorry? - Gongul.

10
00:00:46,952 --> 00:00:48,075
Gongul.

11
00:00:55,562 --> 00:00:56,725
Stop!

12
00:00:58,303 --> 00:01:00,343
- What's wrong, director? - Do you really not know?

13
00:01:00,632 --> 00:01:03,472
Our story is about a forbidden love...

14
00:01:03,473 --> 00:01:05,175
between a king and a clown.

15
00:01:05,943 --> 00:01:09,207
But I don't feel any love inside your eyes right now!

16
00:01:09,313 --> 00:01:11,760
Well, it's because it feels a bit awkward.

17
00:01:11,842 --> 00:01:13,413
That's the problem.

18
00:01:13,682 --> 00:01:15,926
You aren't feeling any love inside while you're acting.

19
00:01:16,023 --> 00:01:17,992
Then how would you be able to move the audience?

20
00:01:18,352 --> 00:01:20,392
This is total fake acting!

21
00:01:20,953 --> 00:01:22,145
I'm sorry, sir.

22
00:01:22,193 --> 00:01:24,161
- I'm sorry, sir. - You leave me no choice.

23
00:01:24,592 --> 00:01:27,489
You two should stick with each other all day from now on.

24
00:01:27,632 --> 00:01:29,744
Or better yet, just live together.

25
00:01:30,163 --> 00:01:31,224
Do you understand?

26
00:01:31,402 --> 00:01:32,422
Yes, sir.

27
00:01:35,842 --> 00:01:41,993
(Can I Love You?)

28
00:01:49,352 --> 00:01:51,495
I think I'm getting the hang of this now.

29
00:01:53,652 --> 00:01:54,714
I'm home.

30
00:01:54,893 --> 00:01:57,270
Jun Ki, I think I'm better at blowing the alphorn...

31
00:01:58,122 --> 00:01:59,825
- Hello. - Yes, hello.

32
00:02:00,363 --> 00:02:01,587
It's been a long time.

33
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:04,390
But what's with the suitcase?

34
00:02:05,902 --> 00:02:07,331
Something came up.

35
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,475
I'll explain it in detail later.

36
00:02:10,242 --> 00:02:12,241
Seung Hyun, let me show you to your room.

37
00:02:12,242 --> 00:02:13,294
Okay.

38
00:02:15,912 --> 00:02:18,181
Jun Ki, does Jung Eun smoke?

39
00:02:18,182 --> 00:02:20,090
- What? - Why does she have a smoking pipe?

40
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,712
That's not a smoking pipe.

41
00:02:22,722 --> 00:02:24,080
It's hard to explain.

42
00:02:24,722 --> 00:02:25,773
Let's go.

43
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:31,712
It's this room.

44
00:02:32,662 --> 00:02:34,019
First of all,

45
00:02:34,893 --> 00:02:36,362
you should unpack.

46
00:02:36,902 --> 00:02:38,432
Oh, okay.

47
00:02:38,703 --> 00:02:39,754
Seung Hyun.

48
00:02:40,603 --> 00:02:42,371
Do we really have to go this far?

49
00:02:42,372 --> 00:02:43,566
The director said...

50
00:02:44,242 --> 00:02:46,894
we need to develop real emotions for each other...

51
00:02:47,513 --> 00:02:49,481
in order to act more realistically.

52
00:02:49,912 --> 00:02:51,341
Let's try our best...

53
00:02:51,342 --> 00:02:53,852
and really make this play a success.

54
00:02:53,853 --> 00:02:55,239
Okay.

55
00:02:56,622 --> 00:02:57,781
Let's give it a try.

56
00:02:57,782 --> 00:03:00,191
Okay. I'll get changed then.

57
00:03:00,192 --> 00:03:02,130
Sure. Take your time.

58
00:03:02,763 --> 00:03:03,916
Wait, Jun Ki.

59
00:03:04,222 --> 00:03:05,284
Yes?

60
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:07,693
If you really love me,

61
00:03:08,032 --> 00:03:10,889
you shouldn't leave the room when I change, should you?

62
00:03:12,502 --> 00:03:13,522
I guess.

63
00:03:14,603 --> 00:03:16,785
I'll just stay then.

64
00:03:16,872 --> 00:03:17,892
Okay.

65
00:03:18,543 --> 00:03:19,594
Good.

66
00:03:27,883 --> 00:03:29,251
Hello, ma'am.

67
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:31,395
Soo Yeon, we don't have a shoot today. What brings you here?

68
00:03:31,622 --> 00:03:33,621
The producer said he has something to say.

69
00:03:33,622 --> 00:03:34,673
I see.

70
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:36,661
What were you doing?

71
00:03:36,662 --> 00:03:38,121
I'm planning a new segment.

72
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:39,313
A new segment?

73
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:43,279
Yes. But nothing is coming to my mind, and I'm going crazy.

74
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,023
My hairband.

75
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:47,255
Where is my hairband?

76
00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:49,510
It was right here just until now.

77
00:03:51,442 --> 00:03:52,542
This happens all the time.

78
00:03:52,543 --> 00:03:55,634
I lost more than 100 hairbands in my room too.

79
00:03:55,983 --> 00:03:58,612
No matter how much I search my room, I can never find it.

80
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,612
Even socks.

81
00:03:59,613 --> 00:04:01,781
Later on, I always find one sock somewhere.

82
00:04:01,782 --> 00:04:04,621
I know. It's not like someone is stealing a sock, right?

83
00:04:04,622 --> 00:04:07,305
It drives me mad when I think about where that sock has gone.

84
00:04:11,592 --> 00:04:13,164
How about this kind of segment?

85
00:04:13,432 --> 00:04:15,330
- What? - Just like now,

86
00:04:15,532 --> 00:04:17,362
how about we answer questions...

87
00:04:17,363 --> 00:04:19,546
that seem ordinary in everyday life but strike our curiosity?

88
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:21,976
We can do experiments and prove it scientifically.

89
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,401
Is it too childish?

90
00:04:23,402 --> 00:04:25,106
No, I like it.

91
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:26,497
It sounds interesting.

92
00:04:26,943 --> 00:04:29,665
Soo Yeon, why don't we plan this in detail?

93
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:31,062
Really?

94
00:04:31,912 --> 00:04:33,075
I'll help you then.

95
00:04:37,683 --> 00:04:38,774
Jun Ki.

96
00:04:39,023 --> 00:04:40,791
Must we watch TV in this position?

97
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:42,558
In order to develop love for each other,

98
00:04:42,962 --> 00:04:44,218
shouldn't we do this?

99
00:04:44,662 --> 00:04:45,988
We have no choice then.

100
00:04:49,302 --> 00:04:50,322
Guys...

101
00:04:51,203 --> 00:04:53,332
What's the issue with those two?

102
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,556
They're practicing their acting.

103
00:04:54,672 --> 00:04:56,642
I think they have to stick together...

104
00:04:56,643 --> 00:04:58,041
all day until they feel love or something.

105
00:04:58,042 --> 00:05:00,114
I told you, acting is no joke.

106
00:05:01,643 --> 00:05:03,411
Woo Shik, it's been a while since you came home.

107
00:05:03,412 --> 00:05:05,523
Yes. It's so hectic lately because of the recording...

108
00:05:05,643 --> 00:05:07,141
and I don't even have time to come home.

109
00:05:07,513 --> 00:05:09,798
I have to wash up and get going today too.

110
00:05:10,883 --> 00:05:14,122
I told you to go home and get some rest. Why did you come here?

111
00:05:14,123 --> 00:05:16,571
There's no one at home anyway and I feel bored.

112
00:05:16,722 --> 00:05:19,091
Is this some playground you can come to when you're bored?

113
00:05:19,092 --> 00:05:20,592
I bought pizza instead.

114
00:05:21,032 --> 00:05:22,185
Forget it.

115
00:05:22,393 --> 00:05:23,687
I'll go take a shower.

116
00:05:23,862 --> 00:05:24,923
Okay.

117
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:32,552
Jung Eun, I have a question.

118
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:34,812
Is Mr. Cha dating someone right now?

119
00:05:34,813 --> 00:05:36,067
No, he's not.

120
00:05:36,143 --> 00:05:38,012
Woo Shik has been single all his life.

121
00:05:38,013 --> 00:05:40,359
- You didn't know? - He's been single all his life?

122
00:05:40,612 --> 00:05:42,652
He's so attractive. How is that possible?

123
00:05:43,953 --> 00:05:45,106
Actually,

124
00:05:45,323 --> 00:05:47,151
Woo Shik has only liked...

125
00:05:47,152 --> 00:05:49,234
one person until now, who is his first love.

126
00:05:49,563 --> 00:05:51,291
But it eventually didn't go well.

127
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:52,312
I see.

128
00:05:53,232 --> 00:05:55,068
Who is his first love?

129
00:05:56,133 --> 00:05:57,224
I'm home.

130
00:05:57,362 --> 00:05:58,382
Hey.

131
00:05:59,503 --> 00:06:01,531
What is Jun Ki doing?

132
00:06:01,532 --> 00:06:04,398
It'll make you more frustrated, so just pretend you didn't see him.

133
00:06:04,602 --> 00:06:05,826
Hello, Soo Yeon.

134
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:09,171
Hello.

135
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:10,711
Soo Yeon, do you want some pizza?

136
00:06:10,712 --> 00:06:12,007
Min Ah brought some for us.

137
00:06:12,342 --> 00:06:14,220
No, I have something to do.

138
00:06:15,313 --> 00:06:16,608
Min Ah, have fun then.

139
00:06:16,722 --> 00:06:17,774
Okay.

140
00:06:20,523 --> 00:06:23,521
What's wrong with her? Soo Yeon really loves pizza.

141
00:06:23,623 --> 00:06:24,714
What's gotten into her?

142
00:06:24,763 --> 00:06:27,791
Jung Eun, so who is Mr. Cha's first love?

143
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:29,361
You just saw her.

144
00:06:29,362 --> 00:06:30,382
What?

145
00:06:30,763 --> 00:06:33,425
Are you saying Soo Yeon is his first love?

146
00:06:39,073 --> 00:06:41,765
Does Min Ah think this place is her home or what?

147
00:06:43,243 --> 00:06:45,487
Why am I so sensitive about Min Ah lately?

148
00:06:46,412 --> 00:06:47,575
Forget it.

149
00:06:48,013 --> 00:06:49,992
Let's forget about her and focus on the proposal.

150
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:01,883
Seung Hyun.

151
00:07:03,063 --> 00:07:05,756
Shall we go to sleep now?

152
00:07:06,503 --> 00:07:07,523
Shall we?

153
00:07:13,472 --> 00:07:14,595
Good night.

154
00:07:16,313 --> 00:07:17,914
- By the way, Jun Ki. - Yes?

155
00:07:18,243 --> 00:07:19,884
If we really love each other,

156
00:07:20,813 --> 00:07:23,067
wouldn't we sleep a bit more affectionately than this?

157
00:07:23,183 --> 00:07:24,346
Like how?

158
00:07:24,422 --> 00:07:27,151
How about if you sleep with my arm around you?

159
00:07:27,152 --> 00:07:28,172
What?

160
00:07:28,422 --> 00:07:29,492
With your arm around me?

161
00:07:29,493 --> 00:07:32,929
That way, I believe we'll be able to get attached sooner.

162
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:34,387
Well, then...

163
00:07:35,493 --> 00:07:37,370
Let's give it a try.

164
00:07:40,172 --> 00:07:41,253
All right.

165
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,276
Good night.

166
00:08:00,693 --> 00:08:03,517
Okay. Good night, Jun Ki.

167
00:08:20,172 --> 00:08:22,692
Why is this so complicated? Is this right?

168
00:08:25,513 --> 00:08:26,651
Yu Ri, are you up?

169
00:08:26,652 --> 00:08:28,040
Yes, I'm up.

170
00:08:30,183 --> 00:08:31,814
What is all this?

171
00:08:31,922 --> 00:08:33,115
Oh, this?

172
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:36,051
My dressing table and chair were too old, so I bought new ones.

173
00:08:36,052 --> 00:08:37,347
I see.

174
00:08:37,692 --> 00:08:38,962
But why did you buy a self-assembly product?

175
00:08:38,963 --> 00:08:40,524
This is much cheaper.

176
00:08:41,093 --> 00:08:43,701
We're barely avoiding being in the red with the food truck.

177
00:08:43,702 --> 00:08:45,029
I should save money like this at least.

178
00:08:45,662 --> 00:08:47,232
My girlfriend is so frugal.

179
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:48,558
Don't say that.

180
00:08:48,873 --> 00:08:52,102
But assembling this is no easy task.

181
00:08:52,103 --> 00:08:54,642
Really? If it's difficult, shall I do it for you?

182
00:08:54,643 --> 00:08:55,911
What? You will?

183
00:08:55,912 --> 00:08:57,342
- Yes. - But this is...

184
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,076
more complicated than you think.

185
00:09:00,152 --> 00:09:03,692
Yu Ri, I may be dumb, but I'm good at things like this.

186
00:09:03,883 --> 00:09:07,321
I'll assemble this quickly, so leave it to me. Just trust me.

187
00:09:07,322 --> 00:09:08,414
Seriously?

188
00:09:09,052 --> 00:09:11,134
I have such an awesome boyfriend.

189
00:09:11,692 --> 00:09:13,906
Come on. This is nothing.

190
00:09:14,062 --> 00:09:16,307
I can get it done in 30 minutes.

191
00:09:16,902 --> 00:09:18,228
That's so impressive.

192
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,272
Then here, Ki Bong. The assembly instructions.

193
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:21,762
Gosh, I don't need it.

194
00:09:21,932 --> 00:09:24,289
Why would I read that just to put together this thing?

195
00:09:24,902 --> 00:09:28,075
All right, then. Shall I get started?

196
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:33,952
Okay. Here we go.

197
00:09:37,922 --> 00:09:39,626
This is so awkward.

198
00:09:40,093 --> 00:09:42,541
Until when do I have to keep doing this?

199
00:09:42,723 --> 00:09:44,018
Gosh, this is so uncomfortable.

200
00:09:44,123 --> 00:09:45,693
My neck is hurting like crazy.

201
00:09:46,763 --> 00:09:47,853
My gosh.

202
00:09:47,932 --> 00:09:50,831
Seung Hyun, what is it? What's wrong?

203
00:09:50,832 --> 00:09:52,872
- I'm getting neck spasms. - What?

204
00:09:52,973 --> 00:09:55,002
Jun Ki, no more of this. This is too uncomfortable.

205
00:09:55,003 --> 00:09:56,156
Oh, okay.

206
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,676
Same here. I can't do this anymore.

207
00:10:00,912 --> 00:10:03,441
What can we do to feel love toward each other?

208
00:10:03,442 --> 00:10:04,809
Do you have any good ideas?

209
00:10:07,113 --> 00:10:08,276
How about this?

210
00:10:08,383 --> 00:10:10,222
Shall we try talking about each other's strengths...

211
00:10:10,223 --> 00:10:12,089
or what we like about one another?

212
00:10:12,253 --> 00:10:14,852
It might help us discover each other's charms.

213
00:10:14,853 --> 00:10:16,118
That's a great idea.

214
00:10:16,223 --> 00:10:17,589
- I'll go first. - Sure.

215
00:10:21,963 --> 00:10:25,267
I think you have such a nice voice.

216
00:10:25,503 --> 00:10:28,102
Your warm voice makes you sound trustworthy.

217
00:10:28,103 --> 00:10:30,621
Really? Thank you.

218
00:10:31,072 --> 00:10:32,704
- Then it's my turn now. - Yes.

219
00:10:32,942 --> 00:10:34,167
Jun Ki, I think...

220
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,668
you have such a charming smile.

221
00:10:37,983 --> 00:10:41,681
Shall I say it puts people in a good mood?

222
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,916
- Seriously? - And your eyes are so attractive.

223
00:10:45,023 --> 00:10:46,951
I think your slightly slanted eyes...

224
00:10:46,952 --> 00:10:49,092
make you look sexy.

225
00:10:49,093 --> 00:10:51,367
My gosh, you're the epitome of sexiness.

226
00:10:51,523 --> 00:10:55,572
You have such a broad chest because you work out regularly.

227
00:10:55,963 --> 00:10:57,493
And look at your lips.

228
00:10:57,633 --> 00:11:01,713
- You have such sexy lips. - What are you talking about?

229
00:11:01,802 --> 00:11:04,117
They're nothing compared to your lips.

230
00:11:04,302 --> 00:11:06,107
Your lips...

231
00:11:06,873 --> 00:11:08,575
make everyone want to kiss you.

232
00:11:12,743 --> 00:11:15,303
Hey, Soo Yeon. Don't get the wrong idea.

233
00:11:15,853 --> 00:11:17,821
I know what you're thinking now,

234
00:11:18,082 --> 00:11:19,826
but it's a misunderstanding.

235
00:11:19,853 --> 00:11:23,222
No, don't mind me. Just continue what you were doing.

236
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:24,823
I didn't hear anything.

237
00:11:24,993 --> 00:11:27,481
Soo Yeon, I said it's a misunderstanding. Soo Yeon!

238
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:28,854
Hey, Soo Yeon!

239
00:11:33,332 --> 00:11:35,953
Okay, this chair is all assembled.

240
00:11:37,402 --> 00:11:38,872
Yu Ri, how does it look?

241
00:11:39,373 --> 00:11:41,861
I must say, it looks a little weird.

242
00:11:42,442 --> 00:11:43,972
What? What's weird about this?

243
00:11:46,383 --> 00:11:49,238
This part. This piece of wood looks a bit odd.

244
00:11:49,753 --> 00:11:52,098
Look at this. It's different from the diagram here.

245
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,151
Oh, you're right.

246
00:11:56,152 --> 00:11:58,233
But I'm sure you can just use it like this.

247
00:11:58,393 --> 00:11:59,515
You think so?

248
00:12:02,893 --> 00:12:04,463
It's all wobbly.

249
00:12:05,202 --> 00:12:08,497
This is... Well, it'll feel like a rocking chair. Isn't it nice?

250
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,671
As long as it doesn't break.

251
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:14,919
Still, I bought it, so I should assemble it properly.

252
00:12:16,643 --> 00:12:18,887
All right, fine. I'll assemble it again for you.

253
00:12:22,353 --> 00:12:25,993
Then I have to remove all the screws and start from scratch.

254
00:12:28,753 --> 00:12:30,803
Well, it'll be nice...

255
00:12:30,922 --> 00:12:33,022
to get it assembled the way it should be.

256
00:12:33,023 --> 00:12:35,480
Okay, I heard you. I'll start again from scratch.

257
00:12:36,192 --> 00:12:38,375
It's such a hassle, but I'll do it.

258
00:12:40,373 --> 00:12:42,208
I'm not sure how this will sound,

259
00:12:43,473 --> 00:12:45,003
but you know that you're quite fussy, right?

260
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:48,091
- What? - Nothing. Never mind.

261
00:12:48,912 --> 00:12:52,311
It'll be a lot easier if you read the instructions first.

262
00:12:52,312 --> 00:12:54,087
I told you that I don't need the instructions.

263
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,951
Why? Are you worried that I might do it wrong again?

264
00:12:56,952 --> 00:12:59,329
- No, that's not what I meant. - Aren't you busy?

265
00:12:59,383 --> 00:13:00,882
Why are you hanging around here?

266
00:13:01,753 --> 00:13:04,548
I'm sorry, but can you please wait outside?

267
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:07,061
I can't focus because you're here.

268
00:13:07,062 --> 00:13:09,032
You're making me feel as if I'm taking a test.

269
00:13:09,432 --> 00:13:10,626
Okay.

270
00:13:11,402 --> 00:13:12,861
I'll wait outside, then.

271
00:13:21,873 --> 00:13:24,126
Gosh, what did I mess up?

272
00:13:26,582 --> 00:13:28,112
Why is it wobbly?

273
00:13:28,613 --> 00:13:30,111
I thought I did everything right.

274
00:13:30,623 --> 00:13:33,713
He offered to assemble it for me. What is his problem?

275
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,175
That little...

276
00:13:38,263 --> 00:13:39,343
No.

277
00:13:40,192 --> 00:13:41,998
Patience. I need to be patient.

278
00:13:42,893 --> 00:13:46,065
I shouldn't belittle my boyfriend. Right, I shouldn't.

279
00:13:51,973 --> 00:13:55,103
Jun Ki, my body is aching all over.

280
00:13:55,312 --> 00:13:56,670
I need to go to the sauna.

281
00:13:56,883 --> 00:13:59,158
- Okay, see you later. - All right.

282
00:14:00,383 --> 00:14:01,606
Wait, Seung Hyun.

283
00:14:02,652 --> 00:14:03,775
What is it?

284
00:14:04,082 --> 00:14:06,266
How about we go to the sauna together?

285
00:14:06,383 --> 00:14:08,691
When men go to the sauna together,

286
00:14:08,692 --> 00:14:11,362
soak in a hot bath, and scrub each other's backs,

287
00:14:11,363 --> 00:14:13,678
- they usually become close. - You're right.

288
00:14:13,832 --> 00:14:15,118
Then let's go together.

289
00:14:15,192 --> 00:14:17,099
- Sounds good! Let's go together. - Let's go!

290
00:14:35,713 --> 00:14:39,048
How awkward. It's gotten even more awkward now.

291
00:14:39,582 --> 00:14:43,337
Why did I step on the soap and fall right on to him?

292
00:14:43,363 --> 00:14:44,485
This is driving me crazy.

293
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:48,965
I can't stop thinking about what happened. I can't even face Jun Ki.

294
00:14:50,202 --> 00:14:51,355
Seung Hyun.

295
00:14:52,263 --> 00:14:55,597
As for what just happened, let's take it to our graves.

296
00:14:56,202 --> 00:14:58,211
Okay, that'd be great.

297
00:14:58,603 --> 00:14:59,724
I'm thirsty.

298
00:15:00,243 --> 00:15:02,926
- Shall we drink something? - Sure, sounds good.

299
00:15:10,822 --> 00:15:13,577
I've assembled this from scratch 20 times already.

300
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:16,647
How come it looks different every single time?

301
00:15:17,863 --> 00:15:20,061
And you call this "instructions"?

302
00:15:20,062 --> 00:15:22,511
How am I supposed to know what to do from these simple diagrams?

303
00:15:23,432 --> 00:15:26,840
Why even buy furniture if customers need to assemble everything?

304
00:15:26,873 --> 00:15:29,602
I should just get some wood from the mountains and make them myself.

305
00:15:29,603 --> 00:15:32,356
Furniture companies are basically robbing customers.

306
00:15:34,873 --> 00:15:36,473
This is crazy.

307
00:15:36,912 --> 00:15:38,647
What did I do wrong?

308
00:15:41,383 --> 00:15:43,522
Ki Bong, I brought you something to drink.

309
00:15:43,523 --> 00:15:44,705
No, thanks. I don't want it.

310
00:15:46,123 --> 00:15:48,366
By the way, are you not done yet?

311
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:51,363
Why do you ask? Do you need this urgently?

312
00:15:51,562 --> 00:15:53,674
Do you need to use this chair right now?

313
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,492
No, it's not that.

314
00:15:55,493 --> 00:15:57,033
Then can you please wait?

315
00:15:57,562 --> 00:16:00,184
As you can see, I'm working hard to assemble this now.

316
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:03,275
How can you be so ungrateful?

317
00:16:03,702 --> 00:16:07,372
Hey, I'll just do it myself if you find it too hard.

318
00:16:07,373 --> 00:16:11,156
Yu Ri, I'm not saying that because I find this hard.

319
00:16:11,182 --> 00:16:12,882
I just think that you could try to be...

320
00:16:12,883 --> 00:16:16,146
more considerate overall and respect me more.

321
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,851
- What? - Forget it.

322
00:16:17,952 --> 00:16:20,809
We can have a proper chat about it after I finish assembling this.

323
00:16:24,893 --> 00:16:27,717
I don't even understand what I did wrong.

324
00:16:28,963 --> 00:16:30,084
- Oh, my. - Yes.

325
00:16:34,902 --> 00:16:36,565
You drink it like this too?

326
00:16:37,373 --> 00:16:41,342
Yes. Yogurt tastes the best when you drink it from the bottom.

327
00:16:41,343 --> 00:16:44,168
I totally agree. I even drink bottled water the same way at times.

328
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:46,273
I even drink canned beer this way sometimes.

329
00:16:46,682 --> 00:16:49,365
We have a lot in common. This is cool.

330
00:16:50,582 --> 00:16:54,092
Seung Hyun, I'm a little hungry. Shall we have some ramyeon?

331
00:16:54,093 --> 00:16:55,252
Ramyeon sounds great.

332
00:16:55,253 --> 00:16:56,752
What should we put in it?

333
00:16:57,192 --> 00:16:58,314
Kimchi?

334
00:16:58,562 --> 00:17:01,092
No, not really. Do you have pork belly by any chance?

335
00:17:01,093 --> 00:17:02,892
I usually cook ramyeon with pork belly.

336
00:17:02,893 --> 00:17:05,331
That's my favorite way of cooking ramyeon.

337
00:17:05,332 --> 00:17:06,903
This is so cool.

338
00:17:08,302 --> 00:17:09,731
- My gosh. - Hold on.

339
00:17:10,372 --> 00:17:12,515
- Why are you clapping like that? - This is how I usually clap.

340
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:14,102
I've been doing this since I was little.

341
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:15,874
Me too. I started clapping this way as a kid.

342
00:17:16,213 --> 00:17:18,482
When I was in kindergarten, I saw kids in Class Seal...

343
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:20,492
clapping like this and started doing the same.

344
00:17:20,552 --> 00:17:21,811
Which kindergarten did you go to?

345
00:17:21,812 --> 00:17:23,781
Hansomang Kindergarten in Hwagok-dong.

346
00:17:23,782 --> 00:17:25,924
What? I went to the same kindergarten.

347
00:17:26,282 --> 00:17:27,373
Seriously?

348
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:30,591
So that kid I saw in Class Seal was you?

349
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,052
That must've been me!

350
00:17:32,163 --> 00:17:33,968
My gosh, what a crazy coincidence!

351
00:17:34,362 --> 00:17:35,995
- This is so cool! - Oh, my.

352
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,656
The aroma of ramyeon with pork belly.

353
00:17:42,572 --> 00:17:44,817
Seung Hyun! Is it not ready yet?

354
00:17:44,973 --> 00:17:46,063
It's ready.

355
00:17:48,312 --> 00:17:51,036
All right, here comes our ramyeon.

356
00:17:53,612 --> 00:17:54,735
Jun Ki!

357
00:17:58,683 --> 00:17:59,875
Gosh, it's hot.

358
00:18:00,223 --> 00:18:02,192
Jun Ki, are you all right? Are you hurt?

359
00:18:02,993 --> 00:18:04,696
No, I'm fine.

360
00:18:05,362 --> 00:18:07,402
Is your hand okay?

361
00:18:09,532 --> 00:18:12,287
It stings a little, but I'm fine.

362
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:17,503
Oh, my goodness. What should we do?

363
00:18:17,743 --> 00:18:18,864
I said I'm fine.

364
00:18:20,812 --> 00:18:21,935
Seung Hyun.

365
00:18:27,013 --> 00:18:30,959
If I can see your smile

366
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:47,564
Okay, let's wrap up for the day.

367
00:18:47,632 --> 00:18:48,928
Thank you.

368
00:18:54,713 --> 00:18:55,937
How did I do?

369
00:18:56,072 --> 00:18:57,816
You've improved a lot,

370
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:01,337
but you still can't quite convey subtle emotions.

371
00:19:01,882 --> 00:19:03,719
But don't worry. You're getting better.

372
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:04,952
Okay.

373
00:19:04,953 --> 00:19:06,145
Go home early today.

374
00:19:06,382 --> 00:19:08,422
I want to go home and get some sleep too.

375
00:19:08,423 --> 00:19:09,551
You should.

376
00:19:09,552 --> 00:19:11,633
You haven't slept for days.

377
00:19:13,322 --> 00:19:15,026
By the way, the lyrics of this song...

378
00:19:15,193 --> 00:19:17,061
were written by you, right?

379
00:19:17,062 --> 00:19:18,631
Yes. Why?

380
00:19:18,632 --> 00:19:20,234
The lyrics are so sad.

381
00:19:21,372 --> 00:19:24,742
Were you thinking about Soo Yeon while writing them?

382
00:19:24,743 --> 00:19:25,763
What?

383
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:27,972
Why are you suddenly bringing up Soo Yeon?

384
00:19:27,973 --> 00:19:29,369
She's...

385
00:19:29,673 --> 00:19:32,640
your first love, right?

386
00:19:34,282 --> 00:19:37,720
If you have time for things like that, take better care of yourself.

387
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:39,144
I'm leaving.

388
00:19:45,092 --> 00:19:47,714
Writing a proposal is harder than I thought.

389
00:19:48,263 --> 00:19:50,373
I don't even have much time. This is not good.

390
00:19:58,602 --> 00:19:59,601
Soo Yeon.

391
00:19:59,602 --> 00:20:01,972
Oh, you're back. You're late.

392
00:20:01,973 --> 00:20:03,503
Yes, I just finished recording.

393
00:20:04,483 --> 00:20:06,349
Why are you still up?

394
00:20:06,382 --> 00:20:08,320
I'm writing a proposal for a new segment.

395
00:20:08,453 --> 00:20:10,145
- A new segment? - Well...

396
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:12,152
We're planning a segment...

397
00:20:12,153 --> 00:20:15,222
where we answer trivial questions in our daily lives.

398
00:20:15,223 --> 00:20:16,722
Really? That sounds fun.

399
00:20:16,723 --> 00:20:17,784
You think so?

400
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,861
But I'm having a hard time coming up with examples.

401
00:20:20,862 --> 00:20:22,596
You are? Do you need some help?

402
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,669
There are some things I've always wondered.

403
00:20:25,003 --> 00:20:26,083
Like what?

404
00:20:28,903 --> 00:20:30,330
- You know the Hulk, right? - Yes.

405
00:20:30,443 --> 00:20:33,604
He is usually small, but he gets bigger when he's angry.

406
00:20:33,812 --> 00:20:36,172
When he becomes bigger, all his clothes get torn...

407
00:20:36,173 --> 00:20:38,488
except his pants. Isn't that strange?

408
00:20:38,713 --> 00:20:39,942
Don't you want to know why?

409
00:20:39,943 --> 00:20:42,054
Yes, I do want to know why,

410
00:20:42,312 --> 00:20:44,621
but I don't think that's a very good example.

411
00:20:44,622 --> 00:20:45,704
It isn't?

412
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:47,674
Then what about this one?

413
00:20:47,753 --> 00:20:50,169
When you put your earphones in your pocket or bag,

414
00:20:50,362 --> 00:20:52,157
they come out tangled...

415
00:20:52,193 --> 00:20:53,519
every single time.

416
00:20:54,193 --> 00:20:56,232
It's not like someone tangles them up on purpose.

417
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:57,702
It's such a mystery.

418
00:20:57,703 --> 00:21:00,212
You're right. I've always wondered that too.

419
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,531
Also, even if you always get up late,

420
00:21:02,532 --> 00:21:04,032
when you ask someone to wake you up,

421
00:21:04,443 --> 00:21:06,514
you wake up early on your own.

422
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:08,272
I really want to know why.

423
00:21:08,273 --> 00:21:09,394
So do I.

424
00:21:10,582 --> 00:21:13,397
I couldn't seem to think of any examples on my own,

425
00:21:13,443 --> 00:21:15,524
but now that you're helping me, it's a lot easier.

426
00:21:15,812 --> 00:21:16,976
Thanks, Woo Shik.

427
00:21:17,023 --> 00:21:18,752
No problem.

428
00:21:18,753 --> 00:21:21,752
You must be tired. Go in and get some sleep.

429
00:21:21,753 --> 00:21:23,323
It's okay. I'm not tired at all.

430
00:21:23,453 --> 00:21:25,564
I slept a lot at the studio, so I'm full of energy now.

431
00:21:27,463 --> 00:21:29,707
Let me see. What else?

432
00:21:37,743 --> 00:21:38,864
- If you look here... - Okay.

433
00:21:48,653 --> 00:21:50,040
Ki Bong.

434
00:21:50,282 --> 00:21:52,466
It's getting late.

435
00:21:52,852 --> 00:21:55,677
Why don't you go to bed now and start again tomorrow?

436
00:21:55,753 --> 00:21:57,119
You can go to bed if you're tired.

437
00:21:57,423 --> 00:21:59,534
I'll stay up all night if I have to.

438
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:02,977
All right. I'll go to bed.

439
00:22:07,903 --> 00:22:08,923
By the way, Yu Ri,

440
00:22:09,372 --> 00:22:11,240
I've been wondering something.

441
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:12,392
What is it?

442
00:22:15,312 --> 00:22:16,945
Did you really have to buy this chair?

443
00:22:17,312 --> 00:22:20,012
- What? - There are many pre-assembled ones.

444
00:22:20,013 --> 00:22:21,889
Why did you have to get this chair, of all chairs?

445
00:22:22,812 --> 00:22:24,251
I'm just curious.

446
00:22:25,082 --> 00:22:26,581
Like I said earlier,

447
00:22:26,723 --> 00:22:28,119
I wanted to save money.

448
00:22:28,892 --> 00:22:30,422
How much did you save?

449
00:22:30,523 --> 00:22:31,848
Like 1,000 dollars?

450
00:22:32,122 --> 00:22:35,020
Well, not that much.

451
00:22:35,292 --> 00:22:37,445
Still, it's always nice to save some money.

452
00:22:38,032 --> 00:22:39,186
Fine.

453
00:22:39,433 --> 00:22:41,402
Even if my eyes fall out or I get a slipped disc,

454
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:43,065
I'll finish assembling this chair.

455
00:22:43,532 --> 00:22:44,930
Goodnight, cheapskate.

456
00:22:55,013 --> 00:22:56,543
It's already light outside.

457
00:23:00,523 --> 00:23:03,042
- Ki Bong. - 2, 3...

458
00:23:06,763 --> 00:23:08,391
Did you stay up all night?

459
00:23:08,392 --> 00:23:10,732
I'm counting these. Please don't talk to me.

460
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:11,753
What?

461
00:23:15,273 --> 00:23:16,293
Okay.

462
00:23:16,503 --> 00:23:17,702
But Ki Bong,

463
00:23:17,703 --> 00:23:21,371
we should get ready for today's work.

464
00:23:21,372 --> 00:23:22,772
I'm sorry,

465
00:23:22,773 --> 00:23:26,209
but I'm not stepping outside this room until I'm done with this.

466
00:23:26,743 --> 00:23:28,343
You'll have to go alone.

467
00:23:28,653 --> 00:23:29,673
What?

468
00:23:29,782 --> 00:23:31,621
You know I'm not a good driver.

469
00:23:31,622 --> 00:23:33,111
I can't drive a truck.

470
00:23:34,223 --> 00:23:36,652
Then call a driver service.

471
00:23:36,653 --> 00:23:37,683
What?

472
00:23:38,223 --> 00:23:41,662
Hey, I can't hire a driver just to run a food truck.

473
00:23:41,663 --> 00:23:43,468
You said you saved some money on this chair.

474
00:23:43,903 --> 00:23:45,667
You could use that money.

475
00:23:46,102 --> 00:23:48,010
- Seriously... - Hey.

476
00:23:48,132 --> 00:23:49,969
I'm trying to focus.

477
00:23:56,042 --> 00:23:58,123
1, 2...

478
00:23:59,243 --> 00:24:00,405
Fine.

479
00:24:00,913 --> 00:24:02,381
I get it.

480
00:24:03,153 --> 00:24:04,714
I'll go alone.

481
00:24:06,882 --> 00:24:08,422
Why are you left here?

482
00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:18,475
If he wasn't my boyfriend...

483
00:24:20,132 --> 00:24:22,214
Patience. Patience.

484
00:24:23,233 --> 00:24:24,833
Where is the driver service number?

485
00:24:34,913 --> 00:24:36,004
Gosh.

486
00:24:36,582 --> 00:24:37,776
When did you wake up?

487
00:24:39,183 --> 00:24:40,652
About an hour ago.

488
00:24:40,653 --> 00:24:43,171
Why didn't you wake me up? Your arm must ache.

489
00:24:43,253 --> 00:24:44,588
Don't worry.

490
00:24:44,993 --> 00:24:46,422
Your head...

491
00:24:46,423 --> 00:24:49,554
is light as a feather. My arm doesn't ache at all.

492
00:24:50,763 --> 00:24:53,313
By the way, do you know...

493
00:24:53,332 --> 00:24:55,750
you look like an angel when you're asleep?

494
00:24:57,142 --> 00:24:59,141
You sound cute when you snore too.

495
00:24:59,142 --> 00:25:01,795
Stop it. What's with you?

496
00:25:02,913 --> 00:25:04,035
By the way,

497
00:25:04,342 --> 00:25:06,581
don't you think we've become a bit closer now?

498
00:25:06,582 --> 00:25:07,776
I know.

499
00:25:08,153 --> 00:25:11,351
Actually, your arm felt so soft.

500
00:25:11,352 --> 00:25:12,576
I slept so well.

501
00:25:13,423 --> 00:25:14,821
Me too.

502
00:25:14,822 --> 00:25:16,591
I haven't slept this well...

503
00:25:16,592 --> 00:25:18,591
in a long time.

504
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,786
That's great.

505
00:25:20,832 --> 00:25:22,432
I'll go take a shower now.

506
00:25:22,433 --> 00:25:23,688
You'll take a shower?

507
00:25:25,032 --> 00:25:26,257
Let me come with you.

508
00:25:26,433 --> 00:25:27,524
Okay.

509
00:25:29,372 --> 00:25:32,502
What did I say our relationship was?

510
00:25:32,503 --> 00:25:34,583
You said I was a man who was your friend.

511
00:25:34,642 --> 00:25:36,871
In short, a male friend, Your Majesty.

512
00:25:36,872 --> 00:25:40,932
But now you feel like more than a male friend.

513
00:25:41,112 --> 00:25:42,132
What should I do?

514
00:25:43,713 --> 00:25:44,803
Your Majesty.

515
00:25:46,282 --> 00:25:47,312
Gongul.

516
00:25:48,453 --> 00:25:49,615
Gongul.

517
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:51,813
Gongul.

518
00:25:52,163 --> 00:25:53,183
Your Majesty.

519
00:25:53,592 --> 00:25:54,684
Gongul.

520
00:25:58,362 --> 00:25:59,454
Gongul.

521
00:25:59,532 --> 00:26:00,899
Hey.

522
00:26:01,973 --> 00:26:04,389
They do look like they're in love now,

523
00:26:04,943 --> 00:26:06,574
but don't you think it's a bit too much?

524
00:26:07,003 --> 00:26:08,063
I know.

525
00:26:09,013 --> 00:26:10,712
It's definitely too much.

526
00:26:10,713 --> 00:26:13,364
What happened in the past few days?

527
00:26:14,013 --> 00:26:15,686
Tell them to stop living together.

528
00:26:15,882 --> 00:26:17,752
- And keep them apart at all times. - Okay.

529
00:26:17,753 --> 00:26:20,129
They shouldn't even talk to each other anymore, okay?

530
00:26:20,183 --> 00:26:21,274
Okay.

531
00:26:24,463 --> 00:26:26,024
Gosh, I'm tired.

532
00:26:27,463 --> 00:26:30,523
Too bad I had to waste money on the driver.

533
00:26:32,062 --> 00:26:33,226
Anyway,

534
00:26:33,832 --> 00:26:36,016
is Ki Bong done assembling the chair?

535
00:26:43,342 --> 00:26:44,403
Ki Bong.

536
00:26:49,253 --> 00:26:50,374
What's wrong?

537
00:26:51,983 --> 00:26:53,073
What happened?

538
00:26:53,253 --> 00:26:54,313
Yu Ri.

539
00:26:55,292 --> 00:26:56,752
I can't do this.

540
00:26:57,622 --> 00:26:59,806
- What? - I give up.

541
00:27:00,963 --> 00:27:04,369
I've put them together and taken them apart a hundred times,

542
00:27:04,463 --> 00:27:06,879
and the chair looks different every time.

543
00:27:08,102 --> 00:27:09,939
There are always some parts left over too.

544
00:27:10,302 --> 00:27:11,731
I can't do this.

545
00:27:12,503 --> 00:27:15,272
I wanted to impress you,

546
00:27:15,273 --> 00:27:16,873
so I did my best.

547
00:27:17,582 --> 00:27:19,276
I'm so sorry.

548
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:21,592
What's wrong with me?

549
00:27:22,153 --> 00:27:25,040
I'm so stupid, and I can't do anything right.

550
00:27:26,282 --> 00:27:28,492
I'm useless.

551
00:27:28,493 --> 00:27:29,778
No, you're not.

552
00:27:29,993 --> 00:27:31,798
You did a very good job.

553
00:27:32,122 --> 00:27:33,861
I prefer how it looks now...

554
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:36,005
to how it's supposed to look. I mean it.

555
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:39,629
- Are you sure? - Yes.

556
00:27:39,802 --> 00:27:41,231
It's completely my style.

557
00:27:42,302 --> 00:27:45,402
You'd make a great furniture designer.

558
00:27:45,403 --> 00:27:48,635
Actually, I do have some artistic talent.

559
00:27:49,642 --> 00:27:51,754
Of course. You're my boyfriend.

560
00:27:52,683 --> 00:27:55,508
If I'd known you'd like it, I wouldn't have worried so much.

561
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:58,576
So relax and get some rest.

562
00:27:58,723 --> 00:28:00,008
You didn't get any sleep last night.

563
00:28:00,082 --> 00:28:01,928
Okay. I'll get some rest.

564
00:28:02,122 --> 00:28:03,724
You can use the chair now.

565
00:28:03,753 --> 00:28:05,291
Also, you can have this.

566
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:06,486
It's a part left over.

567
00:28:11,203 --> 00:28:12,733
Thanks, Ki Bong.

568
00:28:20,713 --> 00:28:22,814
How am I going to use that chair?

569
00:28:25,312 --> 00:28:27,077
What is this?

570
00:28:27,282 --> 00:28:29,048
Should I just do it again myself?

571
00:28:30,582 --> 00:28:32,011
But it might hurt his feelings.

572
00:28:32,582 --> 00:28:33,877
I'll have to use it as it is.

573
00:28:34,723 --> 00:28:36,763
What did he do anyway?

574
00:28:43,632 --> 00:28:45,641
It's too uncomfortable.

575
00:28:45,733 --> 00:28:47,405
What is this?

576
00:28:48,802 --> 00:28:49,893
Wait.

577
00:28:50,233 --> 00:28:51,874
Where's the knob?

578
00:28:53,372 --> 00:28:54,434
My goodness.

579
00:28:55,572 --> 00:28:57,276
The knob is inside?

580
00:29:00,443 --> 00:29:04,706
Dating an innocent guy is seriously so hard.

581
00:29:06,753 --> 00:29:08,558
I wonder what happened to the proposal.

582
00:29:09,953 --> 00:29:12,268
I hope the producer likes it.

583
00:29:16,233 --> 00:29:17,531
Ma'am, how did it go?

584
00:29:17,532 --> 00:29:19,643
- What did the producer say? - The thing is,

585
00:29:20,132 --> 00:29:21,806
he loves it!

586
00:29:23,503 --> 00:29:26,022
- Really? He really likes it? - Yes.

587
00:29:26,173 --> 00:29:29,885
And in a few days, he wants to do a presentation for the director.

588
00:29:30,372 --> 00:29:32,581
If that goes well, will this become a real segment?

589
00:29:32,582 --> 00:29:35,642
Of course. I even thought of a title.

590
00:29:35,882 --> 00:29:38,708
"Trivial Questions that Strike Our Curiosity".

591
00:29:38,753 --> 00:29:40,894
In short, "TQSC".

592
00:29:41,052 --> 00:29:42,891
I like it. It sounds fun.

593
00:29:42,892 --> 00:29:45,411
I will add your name in the front too.

594
00:29:45,862 --> 00:29:48,381
"Han Soo Yeon's TQSC".

595
00:29:49,362 --> 00:29:50,485
Sorry?

596
00:29:50,862 --> 00:29:53,662
My name will be included in the segment title?

597
00:29:53,663 --> 00:29:56,661
Yes, you came up with the idea. Of course it should be in it.

598
00:29:56,802 --> 00:29:58,672
And if this goes really well,

599
00:29:58,673 --> 00:30:01,671
it might become a fixed segment under your own name.

600
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:05,412
So we should really try our best and give it all we got. Okay?

601
00:30:06,243 --> 00:30:07,364
Yes, ma'am.

602
00:30:09,013 --> 00:30:10,237
Thank you.

603
00:30:15,592 --> 00:30:18,786
It might become a segment under my name?

604
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,895
Is this a dream come true or what?

605
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,657
I feel so happy.

606
00:30:26,302 --> 00:30:28,476
This is all thanks to Woo Shik's help.

607
00:30:30,173 --> 00:30:31,805
Should I get him some hotteok?

608
00:30:35,213 --> 00:30:36,294
Hey, Soo Yeon.

609
00:30:36,473 --> 00:30:38,982
Woo Shik, it's me. Do you want some hotteok?

610
00:30:38,983 --> 00:30:40,742
Hotteok? Do you want hotteok?

611
00:30:40,743 --> 00:30:42,588
Should I buy you some? I'm in front of the truck right now.

612
00:30:42,812 --> 00:30:45,302
Really? I'm in front of...

613
00:30:53,523 --> 00:30:54,686
How many do you want?

614
00:30:56,032 --> 00:30:57,562
Soo Yeon, how many do you want?

615
00:30:59,503 --> 00:31:00,624
500.

616
00:31:01,332 --> 00:31:04,086
- What? - Get me 500 pieces.

617
00:31:08,173 --> 00:31:09,600
Soo Yeon?

618
00:31:11,483 --> 00:31:13,930
- She hung up. - What's wrong?

619
00:31:16,052 --> 00:31:17,206
It's nothing.

620
00:31:18,483 --> 00:31:20,682
- Ma'am. - Yes?

621
00:31:20,683 --> 00:31:22,865
How long does it take to make 500 pieces?

What was that?

624
00:31:38,602 --> 00:31:40,510
Why did I get angry at Woo Shik?

625
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:43,133
I mean, why?

626
00:31:52,183 --> 00:31:53,814
Hey, what is it?

627
00:31:54,822 --> 00:31:55,945
Your hotteok.

628
00:31:59,062 --> 00:32:02,735
The lady didn't have enough ingredients, so I couldn't get 500.

629
00:32:03,092 --> 00:32:04,256
Is that okay?

630
00:32:04,862 --> 00:32:06,434
No, it's fine.

631
00:32:07,602 --> 00:32:09,917
Woo Shik, I'm feeling a bit tired.

632
00:32:10,173 --> 00:32:11,835
Oh, okay then.

633
00:32:12,342 --> 00:32:13,424
Get some rest.

634
00:32:20,782 --> 00:32:22,007
What is wrong with me?

635
00:32:23,782 --> 00:32:25,486
What's the matter with me?

636

(One Day, Suddenly)

637
00:32:32,362 --> 00:32:34,740
Here we are. It's hot.

638
00:32:34,963 --> 00:32:37,410
Here you go, your ramyeon is ready.

639
00:32:37,733 --> 00:32:39,601
Ta-da!

640
00:32:39,602 --> 00:32:41,202
You cooked it really well.

641
00:32:41,203 --> 00:32:43,071
Ki Bong is the best at cooking ramyeon.

642
00:32:43,072 --> 00:32:45,622
I know. Shall I take a bite?

643
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,641
Jun Ki, stop what you're doing.

644
00:32:49,312 --> 00:32:50,641
What? What do you want?

645
00:32:50,642 --> 00:32:53,570
How could you eat ramyeon when your hemorrhoids isn't even cured?

646
00:32:53,683 --> 00:32:55,452
Do you know how bad spicy food is for your hemorrhoids?

647
00:32:55,453 --> 00:32:57,311
It's fine, don't worry.

648
00:32:57,312 --> 00:32:59,022
Do you know how important food is for your health?

649
00:32:59,023 --> 00:33:00,176
I should at least have a bite.

650
00:33:00,223 --> 00:33:01,753
I told you not to eat it.

651
00:33:02,322 --> 00:33:03,522
Just sit there and wait.

652
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,532
I'll make you chicken soup with abalones.

653
00:33:06,993 --> 00:33:08,083
Abalones?

654
00:33:08,263 --> 00:33:10,098
Why? Are abalones good for curing hemorrhoids?

655
00:33:10,193 --> 00:33:13,089
It's not that. Your performance is starting tomorrow.

656
00:33:13,132 --> 00:33:14,969
I'll cook something good for you. Okay?

657
00:33:15,572 --> 00:33:16,653
Wait.

658
00:33:16,733 --> 00:33:18,783
- Tomorrow's your first performance? - Yes.

659
00:33:18,903 --> 00:33:21,524
I don't think Yu Ri and I will make it because of our business.

660
00:33:21,773 --> 00:33:24,212
I have a recording tomorrow too. I'm sorry.

661
00:33:24,213 --> 00:33:25,641
Forget it, you jerks!

662
00:33:25,642 --> 00:33:27,621
I wasn't even looking forward to you guys coming.

663
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:31,381
My best friend is the only one who truly cares for me.

664
00:33:31,423 --> 00:33:32,780
You only call me your best friend at times like this.

665
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:36,286
Anyway, I'll go watch your play with my friends from the shooting team,

666
00:33:36,352 --> 00:33:38,536
- so you better do a good job. - Don't worry.

667
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:41,996
I'll prepare all the nice seats, so bring all your friends.

668
00:33:42,993 --> 00:33:44,932
(The King's Male Friend)

669
00:33:44,933 --> 00:33:46,024
This way.

670
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,933
Enjoy the performance.

671
00:33:54,872 --> 00:33:55,964
Why am I so nervous?

672
00:33:56,773 --> 00:33:57,936
This is driving me crazy.

673
00:34:02,253 --> 00:34:04,323
Jun Ki, here.

674
00:34:04,852 --> 00:34:05,922
Oh, you're here.

675
00:34:05,923 --> 00:34:07,381
Thanks for the flowers.

676
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:13,819
- Wait, why do you look so down? - What?

677
00:34:15,193 --> 00:34:18,977
The thing is, I'm really nervous.

678
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:22,218
It's been so long since I acted in front of an audience,

679
00:34:22,573 --> 00:34:25,153
and I can't remember my lines, and everything is jumbled up.

680
00:34:25,943 --> 00:34:29,206
Hey, what if I ruin today's performance?

681
00:34:29,312 --> 00:34:32,066
Come on. It's not like you to be discouraged like this.

682
00:34:32,642 --> 00:34:33,764
Okay.

683
00:34:38,283 --> 00:34:40,874
My friend. Just believe in yourself.

684
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:43,806
You're a really good actor. I know that for sure.

685
00:34:44,253 --> 00:34:47,486
To me, you're Song Kang Ho, Hwang Jung Min,

686
00:34:47,662 --> 00:34:49,365
and Lee Byung Hun. Okay?

687
00:34:49,863 --> 00:34:51,661
So don't be frightened...

688
00:34:51,662 --> 00:34:54,835
and go out there and show everyone what a real actor is. Okay?

689
00:34:56,702 --> 00:34:58,915
Okay, fine.

690
00:34:58,943 --> 00:35:00,268
I can't hear you.

691
00:35:01,673 --> 00:35:03,142
Can you do a good job or not?

692
00:35:06,182 --> 00:35:08,019
Okay, I got it.

693
00:35:08,283 --> 00:35:11,515
I have to do my makeup again because of you. You little...

694
00:35:11,622 --> 00:35:12,949
Now you're the Jun Ki that I know.

695
00:35:14,852 --> 00:35:16,249
Anyway, thanks.

696
00:35:16,792 --> 00:35:18,394
I think I feel a little better thanks to you.

697
00:35:20,222 --> 00:35:22,742
Jung Eun, we have to go in now.

698
00:35:22,892 --> 00:35:25,076
- Okay. - Who is he?

699
00:35:25,403 --> 00:35:27,504
Oh, he's a friend that's shooting with me these days.

700
00:35:27,903 --> 00:35:29,911
Good luck on your performance. You can do it!

701
00:35:30,033 --> 00:35:31,266
Okay.

702
00:35:31,742 --> 00:35:32,824
Let's go.

703
00:35:39,082 --> 00:35:41,194
Okay. I can do it.

704
00:35:42,283 --> 00:35:43,435
Let's go!

705
00:35:44,412 --> 00:35:47,686
I wish time stops like this.

706
00:35:48,323 --> 00:35:50,025
Shall we just run away to somewhere far away?

707
00:35:50,153 --> 00:35:52,100
We'll go to a mountain where no one will find us,

708
00:35:52,323 --> 00:35:54,882
and live happily ever after. What do you think?

709
00:35:55,492 --> 00:35:56,717
It sounds good,

710
00:35:58,262 --> 00:35:59,997
but I can't, Your Majesty.

711
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:02,855
You can't? What do you mean?

712
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:09,912
I must leave you now, Your Majesty.

713
00:36:11,512 --> 00:36:13,552
Leave? Where?

714
00:36:21,323 --> 00:36:23,190
To Seoul, 2019.

715
00:36:24,593 --> 00:36:26,123
2019?

716
00:36:26,222 --> 00:36:27,691
What are you talking about?

717
00:36:27,722 --> 00:36:31,231
Actually, I'm from Seoul, Korea in the year of 2019.

718
00:36:31,403 --> 00:36:33,504
I'm a student from the science class of Myeongsung High School.

719
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,639
I was inventing this time machine...

720
00:36:36,073 --> 00:36:38,215
and made the mistake of landing here.

721
00:36:38,503 --> 00:36:40,601
What? A time machine?

722
00:36:40,602 --> 00:36:42,653
There's no time left to explain.

723
00:36:42,713 --> 00:36:44,579
It's time for me to leave, Your Majesty.

724
00:36:45,082 --> 00:36:47,969
It was an honor for me to live as the king's male friend...

725
00:36:49,483 --> 00:36:50,809
all this time.

726
00:36:53,923 --> 00:36:55,045
Goodbye, then.

727
00:36:56,992 --> 00:36:58,145
My male friend.

728
00:37:12,142 --> 00:37:15,539
Gongul. Gongul!

729
00:37:16,113 --> 00:37:18,388
Gongul!

730
00:37:59,823 --> 00:38:01,760
I wonder how Jun Ki's play is going.

731
00:38:01,992 --> 00:38:03,145
I'm sorry I couldn't make it.

732
00:38:04,662 --> 00:38:07,652
I need to finish this recording in order to go.

733
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:10,490
Why is everyone so late?

734
00:38:14,102 --> 00:38:16,622
- Mr. Cha, hello. - You're late.

735
00:38:17,803 --> 00:38:18,942
What's wrong with your face?

736
00:38:18,943 --> 00:38:22,511
I had a drink last night after the recording...

737
00:38:22,512 --> 00:38:23,940
and I have an upset stomach.

738
00:38:24,783 --> 00:38:25,966
Min Ah isn't here yet, right?

739
00:38:26,213 --> 00:38:29,273
I'll lie down on the couch until she comes.

740
00:38:30,053 --> 00:38:31,552
I think I might die.

741
00:38:36,653 --> 00:38:38,224
Hello, Mr. Cha.

742
00:38:38,722 --> 00:38:40,527
What's wrong with your voice?

743
00:38:40,762 --> 00:38:43,650
Well, I'm suffering from enteritis.

744
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,596
Enteritis? Why so suddenly?

745
00:38:45,733 --> 00:38:48,532
After our recording last night, I met my friends...

746
00:38:48,533 --> 00:38:51,501
and went to the beach to eat grilled clams.

747
00:38:51,972 --> 00:38:53,432
I think something was wrong with the clams.

748
00:38:54,173 --> 00:38:55,263
What?

749
00:38:55,673 --> 00:38:57,447
What are you thinking?

750
00:38:58,443 --> 00:38:59,982
How could you think of going to the beach...

751
00:38:59,983 --> 00:39:01,513
when you're recording your album to be a singer?

752
00:39:01,852 --> 00:39:03,138
Can't you be more professional?

753
00:39:03,983 --> 00:39:06,822
Whenever I had a recording back in the day, I wrapped...

754
00:39:06,823 --> 00:39:09,780
my neck in a towel to protect it even in summertime, okay?

755
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:13,617
You must take care of yourself if you're a pro, don't you think?

756
00:39:14,093 --> 00:39:15,391
I'm sorry.

757
00:39:15,392 --> 00:39:16,453
I don't want to hear it!

758
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:19,331
And you too, Hyung Seok.

759
00:39:19,332 --> 00:39:22,230
You knew about this recording. How could you drink the night before?

760
00:39:22,872 --> 00:39:25,219
You should at least try not to inconvenience others.

761
00:39:26,102 --> 00:39:27,980
You guys have no self-discipline.

762
00:39:28,843 --> 00:39:30,812
- I'm sorry. - Forget it.

763
00:39:31,173 --> 00:39:33,937
I'm incredibly disappointed in both of you!

764
00:39:36,452 --> 00:39:37,533
Mr. Cha!

765
00:39:52,202 --> 00:39:54,061
My gosh. Soo Yeon, what are you doing?

766
00:39:54,062 --> 00:39:56,623
What? Can't you tell? I'm cleaning.

767
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,547
Get me 500 pieces.

768
00:40:05,843 --> 00:40:09,280
Why am I so bothered by Woo Shik spending time with Min Ah?

769
00:40:12,653 --> 00:40:14,968
Do I actually have feelings for him?

770
00:40:21,492 --> 00:40:24,431
Soo Yeon, you found all the photos, right?

771
00:40:24,432 --> 00:40:25,524
Yes, ma'am.

772
00:40:27,062 --> 00:40:29,418
The director is very picky.

773
00:40:29,533 --> 00:40:31,267
We have to prepare everything perfectly.

774
00:40:31,332 --> 00:40:33,312
It looks like we'll have to pull another all-nighter.

775
00:40:33,702 --> 00:40:34,701
You're okay with that, right?

776
00:40:34,702 --> 00:40:36,548
Yes, of course. Don't worry.

777
00:40:38,312 --> 00:40:39,607
Let's get started, then.

778
00:40:40,582 --> 00:40:44,387
Right, I can't afford to be stressed out about Woo Shik now.

779
00:40:45,182 --> 00:40:47,773
Work is my number one priority at the moment.

780
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:50,700
Don't think about anything else. Just focus on work.

781
00:40:59,432 --> 00:41:01,820
How boring. Gosh, this is so boring.

782
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:05,390
What's going on? Why isn't anyone back yet?

783
00:41:05,843 --> 00:41:07,505
I'm bored out of my mind.

784
00:41:10,042 --> 00:41:13,989
By the way, why isn't Jung Eun back yet? It's getting late!

785
00:41:14,082 --> 00:41:15,377
I'm back!

786
00:41:17,682 --> 00:41:19,621
Hey! Why are you getting in just now?

787
00:41:19,622 --> 00:41:21,592
I know that you're ugly, but you should still...

788
00:41:22,523 --> 00:41:24,186
Were you with that guy until now?

789
00:41:24,392 --> 00:41:25,412
Yes.

790
00:41:25,722 --> 00:41:27,862
You know what? Min Jun formally...

791
00:41:27,863 --> 00:41:29,903
asked me out today.

792
00:41:30,262 --> 00:41:31,282
What?

793
00:41:32,602 --> 00:41:35,072
So? Did you say yes?

794
00:41:35,073 --> 00:41:36,398
I told him I'd think about it.

795
00:41:36,633 --> 00:41:38,802
But I think I'm going to start seeing him casually.

796
00:41:38,803 --> 00:41:41,771
What are you talking about? You don't even know him well.

797
00:41:41,872 --> 00:41:43,842
What's the problem? Min Jun is a good guy.

798
00:41:43,843 --> 00:41:45,541
How on earth do you know that?

799
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:46,942
You have such low standards for men.

800
00:41:46,943 --> 00:41:47,942
What?

801
00:41:47,943 --> 00:41:51,319
By the way, why do you care whether or not I date him?

802
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:52,573
What?

803
00:41:55,852 --> 00:41:58,522
I'm just worried that you might end up with a bad guy like Sang Woo,

804
00:41:58,523 --> 00:42:00,869
who's going to make you cry. Does that answer your question?

805
00:42:01,392 --> 00:42:03,707
You think he's like that? What should I do, then?

806
00:42:04,792 --> 00:42:06,058
Bring him over.

807
00:42:06,662 --> 00:42:09,528
I'll try to gauge whether he's a keeper or not.

808
00:42:09,702 --> 00:42:12,049
Men can tell who are good guys.

809
00:42:12,173 --> 00:42:14,111
Really? Okay.

810
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,112
Gosh, I'm so angry!

811
00:42:18,113 --> 00:42:20,342
Hey, what's the matter? Did something happen?

812
00:42:20,343 --> 00:42:22,250
Something got me all angry at the recording studio.

813
00:42:23,653 --> 00:42:24,752
Do we have more ice cubes?

814
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:26,382
Ice cubes? Look in the freezer.

815
00:42:26,383 --> 00:42:27,505
Okay.

816
00:42:27,952 --> 00:42:29,890
People just don't have the professional mindset.

817
00:42:32,823 --> 00:42:34,991
Anyway, decide on the date as soon as possible.

818
00:42:34,992 --> 00:42:36,287
I'll figure him out for you.

819
00:42:37,662 --> 00:42:39,336
I'll put him under a microscope.

820
00:42:40,262 --> 00:42:41,487
I'm getting a bad feeling.

821
00:42:43,533 --> 00:42:45,235
"Your Majesty, how dare I?"

822
00:42:47,142 --> 00:42:48,367
I'm here,

823
00:42:48,912 --> 00:42:50,167
and you're there.

824
00:42:53,012 --> 00:42:54,237
- Jun Ki. - Yes?

825
00:42:54,312 --> 00:42:55,752
It's my day off,

826
00:42:55,753 --> 00:42:57,351
so Yu Ri and I are going to watch your play.

827
00:42:57,352 --> 00:42:58,372
What time does it start?

828
00:42:58,753 --> 00:43:00,149
There's no performance today.

829
00:43:00,253 --> 00:43:02,293
Really? When is it, then?

830
00:43:02,323 --> 00:43:04,891
It's the day after tomorrow. You can come with everyone.

831
00:43:04,892 --> 00:43:06,161
I'll save good seats for you guys.

832
00:43:06,162 --> 00:43:07,214
All right.

833
00:43:09,892 --> 00:43:12,656
Woo Shik said he has a recording early today, but he's still asleep.

834
00:43:15,803 --> 00:43:17,465
Hey, shouldn't you get going for the recording?

835
00:43:19,042 --> 00:43:21,082
Woo Shik, wake up.

836
00:43:23,173 --> 00:43:24,911
Woo Shik, what's wrong?

837
00:43:24,912 --> 00:43:25,932
Are you feeling sick?

838
00:43:26,412 --> 00:43:27,534
I've been...

839
00:43:27,943 --> 00:43:30,227
getting chills since last night.

840
00:43:31,253 --> 00:43:32,649
I have a fever too.

841
00:43:33,983 --> 00:43:36,501
You ate the whole bag of ice cubes, wearing your half-sleeved shirt.

842
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:38,118
I guess he caught a bad cold.

843
00:43:38,292 --> 00:43:39,791
Gosh, you think so?

844
00:43:39,892 --> 00:43:41,117
Hey, this isn't good.

845
00:43:41,423 --> 00:43:43,032
How about you just cancel the recording?

846
00:43:43,033 --> 00:43:44,317
I can't.

847
00:43:44,792 --> 00:43:46,975
The company wants it done as soon as possible.

848
00:43:47,863 --> 00:43:50,352
I'll be fine after getting a shot at the hospital.

849
00:44:00,412 --> 00:44:01,432
I feel like I'm dying.

850
00:44:02,253 --> 00:44:03,851
The shot and the medication...

851
00:44:03,852 --> 00:44:05,281
are making me drowsier.

852
00:44:07,883 --> 00:44:11,392
It looks like I should reschedule the recording.

853
00:44:23,173 --> 00:44:24,254
- Hello! - Hello!

854
00:44:26,673 --> 00:44:28,311
Why are you both so early today?

855
00:44:28,312 --> 00:44:29,741
We're very sorry about yesterday.

856
00:44:29,742 --> 00:44:31,824
We definitely should've been more professional.

857
00:44:31,983 --> 00:44:33,982
From now on, we'll stay focused and work hard.

858
00:44:34,113 --> 00:44:37,070
I got an IV yesterday, so I feel much more energized today.

859
00:44:37,153 --> 00:44:39,468
I'll never make that mistake again.

860
00:44:39,483 --> 00:44:41,737
- I'm really sorry. - What?

861
00:44:42,352 --> 00:44:43,954
Oh, okay.

862
00:44:44,222 --> 00:44:46,721
We're all ready. Shall we get started right away?

863
00:44:46,722 --> 00:44:47,947
What? Right away?

864
00:44:48,463 --> 00:44:49,686
This is crazy.

865
00:44:49,932 --> 00:44:51,737
I don't think I can do this because I'm so sick.

866
00:44:52,202 --> 00:44:53,793
But after what I said to them yesterday,

867
00:44:54,003 --> 00:44:56,726
I can't cancel the recording now. What should I do?

868
00:44:57,233 --> 00:44:59,956
What's wrong, Mr. Cha? Are you feeling sick?

869
00:45:00,273 --> 00:45:02,384
- You don't look well. - What?

870
00:45:02,872 --> 00:45:03,994
No, no.

871
00:45:04,512 --> 00:45:06,992
I'm fine. I'm totally fine.

872
00:45:17,452 --> 00:45:18,544
Mr. Cha.

873
00:45:20,062 --> 00:45:21,419
That's my seat.

874
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:23,735
Sorry? Oh, is it?

875
00:45:25,503 --> 00:45:26,890
I just wanted to sit here.

876
00:45:29,903 --> 00:45:31,566
I'm cold. I'm freezing.

877
00:45:32,003 --> 00:45:33,298
Why am I so cold?

878
00:45:34,403 --> 00:45:36,811
By the way, why is it so hot in this studio?

879
00:45:36,812 --> 00:45:38,719
It's because of all the heat from the machines.

880
00:45:39,142 --> 00:45:40,442
Shall we turn on the air conditioner?

881
00:45:40,443 --> 00:45:41,880
What? The air conditioner?

882
00:45:43,082 --> 00:45:44,919
Is that really necessary?

883
00:45:45,122 --> 00:45:47,621
I can't sing in my optimal condition when it's too hot.

884
00:45:47,622 --> 00:45:49,252
We can't let that happen.

885
00:45:49,253 --> 00:45:50,822
You must sing in your best condition.

886
00:45:50,823 --> 00:45:52,022
You can blast the air conditioner.

887
00:45:52,023 --> 00:45:53,083
Okay.

888
00:45:56,892 --> 00:45:58,392
Gosh, this is crazy.

889
00:45:58,762 --> 00:46:00,844
I'm so cold. I'm freezing now.

890
00:46:06,943 --> 00:46:08,543
Are you my man?

891
00:46:09,613 --> 00:46:10,970
I can't get this part right.

892
00:46:11,812 --> 00:46:13,107
Hey, Jun Ki.

893
00:46:13,682 --> 00:46:15,081
Min Jun is here.

894
00:46:15,082 --> 00:46:16,782
Really? Okay.

895
00:46:16,783 --> 00:46:17,975
Ki Bong, let's go!

896
00:46:18,383 --> 00:46:19,552
What? Me too?

897
00:46:19,553 --> 00:46:20,581
That's right, you punk.

898
00:46:20,582 --> 00:46:22,451
This is about Jung Eun's future. We must help her out.

899
00:46:22,452 --> 00:46:23,472
Right?

900
00:46:24,122 --> 00:46:25,214
Let's go!

901
00:46:25,323 --> 00:46:26,384
I have to finish this game.

902
00:46:26,463 --> 00:46:27,952
Gosh, whatever. Come on!

903
00:46:28,162 --> 00:46:29,417
Come with me already.

904
00:46:30,778 --> 00:46:33,177
Thanks for inviting me over, Jung Eun.

905
00:46:33,178 --> 00:46:34,208
It's my pleasure.

906
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:37,118
My friends really wanted to meet you.

907
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:38,199
Oh, is that right?

908
00:46:38,488 --> 00:46:39,817
Now, I'm getting nervous.

909
00:46:39,818 --> 00:46:42,848
Cut the small talk.

910
00:46:43,689 --> 00:46:45,014
Let's get to the point.

911
00:46:46,488 --> 00:46:48,436
I know what your name is.

912
00:46:48,959 --> 00:46:50,530
How big is your family?

913
00:46:50,698 --> 00:46:52,427
I have a brother and a sister, and I'm the second one.

914
00:46:52,428 --> 00:46:55,499
The second one? You're sandwiched in the middle. Okay.

915
00:46:56,269 --> 00:46:57,359
What about your place?

916
00:46:57,738 --> 00:46:59,645
Do you own it? Or are you on a long-term lease?

917
00:46:59,869 --> 00:47:00,930
Or do you pay monthly rent?

918
00:47:01,539 --> 00:47:03,344
Rent? Monthly?

919
00:47:03,579 --> 00:47:05,822
Sorry? Why are you asking such a question?

920
00:47:07,548 --> 00:47:10,447
I'm like a brother and father to Jung Eun,

921
00:47:10,448 --> 00:47:13,141
so I wanted to know more about the guy she's seeing.

922
00:47:13,849 --> 00:47:14,940
What's the problem?

923
00:47:15,718 --> 00:47:16,788
Are you hiding something?

924
00:47:16,789 --> 00:47:18,018
No, it's not that.

925
00:47:18,019 --> 00:47:19,027
Then answer my question.

926
00:47:19,028 --> 00:47:21,188
Sure, I'm currently living with my parents at their place.

927
00:47:21,189 --> 00:47:22,422
I see, living with parents.

928
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:25,057
What do you like about Jung Eun?

929
00:47:25,169 --> 00:47:26,219
Jung Eun?

930
00:47:27,329 --> 00:47:29,134
She's so pretty and kind.

931
00:47:34,909 --> 00:47:36,470
"Pretty and kind"?

932
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,078
He's funny. He sure has a good sense of humor.

933
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:41,047
You get 100 points for your sense of humor.

934
00:47:41,178 --> 00:47:42,270
You got a passing mark.

935
00:47:42,778 --> 00:47:43,900
Just for this category.

936
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:50,352
What do you think? He's a nice guy, right?

937
00:47:50,758 --> 00:47:53,487
Yes, he's handsome and easygoing.

938
00:47:53,488 --> 00:47:54,713
He seems like a good guy.

939
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:55,897
Hey.

940
00:47:55,898 --> 00:47:58,228
What's the use of being handsome and easygoing?

941
00:47:58,229 --> 00:48:00,003
Men must be competent.

942
00:48:00,298 --> 00:48:02,103
Don't you know that's most important for men?

943
00:48:02,238 --> 00:48:03,973
Min Jun is a game company CEO.

944
00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:05,768
Their sales last year were over 10 million dollars.

945
00:48:05,769 --> 00:48:07,442
10 million?

946
00:48:08,209 --> 00:48:09,769
You said he was an actor.

947
00:48:10,479 --> 00:48:13,099
Acting is just a dream he pursues on the side.

948
00:48:13,648 --> 00:48:15,107
He's competent too.

949
00:48:15,108 --> 00:48:17,078
- Jung Eun, you should date him. - You think so?

950
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:18,302
What are you talking about?

951
00:48:18,689 --> 00:48:21,688
He's handsome, nice, and competent. So what?

952
00:48:21,689 --> 00:48:24,136
A man has to be healthy.

953
00:48:24,459 --> 00:48:26,019
When you lose your health, you lose everything.

954
00:48:26,258 --> 00:48:30,098
He's a triathlon gold medalist.

955
00:48:30,099 --> 00:48:31,904
He's a gold medalist?

956
00:48:32,269 --> 00:48:34,467
Then he's almost perfect.

957
00:48:34,468 --> 00:48:36,203
You should date him. Definitely.

958
00:48:36,898 --> 00:48:38,268
Cut it out.

959
00:48:38,269 --> 00:48:41,567
He might be handsome, nice,

960
00:48:41,568 --> 00:48:43,578
competent, and healthy. But that's not everything.

961
00:48:43,579 --> 00:48:44,660
What else is there?

962
00:48:46,579 --> 00:48:49,078
To really know a man, you should drink with him.

963
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:51,248
- Drink? - You should find a man...

964
00:48:51,249 --> 00:48:53,118
who can control himself even when he's drunk...

965
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,403
and won't make you worry.

966
00:48:55,758 --> 00:48:56,839
So?

967
00:49:00,858 --> 00:49:02,868
I'll take care of it. You guys just watch.

968
00:49:07,669 --> 00:49:10,799
- Min Jun, let's go have a drink. - What?

969
00:49:10,939 --> 00:49:12,264
Let's go have a drink.

970
00:49:12,909 --> 00:49:15,050
What? You don't drink?

971
00:49:15,378 --> 00:49:16,908
Well, I do.

972
00:49:16,909 --> 00:49:18,030
Then come with me.

973
00:49:19,309 --> 00:49:20,471
Come.

974
00:49:28,448 --> 00:49:31,375
My rough thoughts

975
00:49:31,659 --> 00:49:34,545
And the insecure light in my eyes

976
00:49:34,758 --> 00:49:37,247
You have to watch...

977
00:49:37,398 --> 00:49:39,127
Min Jun, what happened?

978
00:49:39,128 --> 00:49:41,924
He got drunk after a few glasses.

979
00:49:42,099 --> 00:49:44,237
What's my name?

980
00:49:44,238 --> 00:49:47,165
Park Yi Do!

981
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:50,609
There he goes again.

982
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:53,128
Gosh, I can't believe this punk.

983
00:49:54,479 --> 00:49:59,212
Please call my name

984
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:07,328
Woo Shik, how was it this time?

985
00:50:07,889 --> 00:50:09,256
What? What do you need?

986
00:50:09,528 --> 00:50:11,090
What did you think of my singing this time?

987
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:16,883
What's wrong? Mr. Cha!

988
00:50:19,968 --> 00:50:22,324
- What did you say? - Did you like my singing?

989
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:28,995
It was the best ever.

990
00:50:29,678 --> 00:50:31,892
I don't remember anything at all.

991
00:50:33,088 --> 00:50:35,261
Really? That's great.

992
00:50:35,718 --> 00:50:36,779
Gosh, it's cold.

993
00:50:37,318 --> 00:50:38,859
That darn air conditioner.

994
00:50:40,628 --> 00:50:42,974
Why are you shivering?

995
00:50:44,229 --> 00:50:45,656
Well...

996
00:50:46,428 --> 00:50:49,836
It's your song. It was so good that it gave me the chills.

997
00:50:51,269 --> 00:50:52,635
You even have a runny nose.

998
00:50:52,809 --> 00:50:55,308
Did you catch a cold?

999
00:50:55,309 --> 00:50:56,399
What?

1000
00:50:58,338 --> 00:50:59,705
Oh, this.

1001
00:51:00,108 --> 00:51:03,077
I do have a runny nose, but it's not a cold.

1002
00:51:03,349 --> 00:51:06,653
I get a runny nose when I concentrate.

1003
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:09,257
Really?

1004
00:51:09,258 --> 00:51:12,491
The recording went well. Why don't we call it a day?

1005
00:51:12,628 --> 00:51:15,240
Already? I'm not completely satisfied yet.

1006
00:51:15,729 --> 00:51:16,921
Let me try again.

1007
00:51:17,528 --> 00:51:18,997
- Do you have to? - Yes.

1008
00:51:19,169 --> 00:51:22,566
I want to continue until I'm totally satisfied.

1009
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:23,720
All right.

1010
00:51:25,369 --> 00:51:27,607
You're very ambitious.

1011
00:51:27,608 --> 00:51:29,209
I'm your student after all.

1012
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:30,562
I'm going back in.

1013
00:51:33,678 --> 00:51:36,402
Gosh, I can't stand it anymore.

1014
00:51:36,919 --> 00:51:38,000
It's too cold.

1015
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:44,501
(Segment Introduction)

1016
00:51:48,258 --> 00:51:49,421
Soo Yeon.

1017
00:51:50,628 --> 00:51:52,397
Can I borrow your pink dress?

1018
00:51:52,398 --> 00:51:53,828
What? Why?

1019
00:51:53,829 --> 00:51:57,098
Min Jun is taking me to a fancy restaurant.

1020
00:51:57,099 --> 00:51:58,237
Really?

1021
00:51:58,238 --> 00:51:59,737
It's in the wardrobe. You can take it.

1022
00:51:59,738 --> 00:52:00,892
Thank you.

1023
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:14,089
Are you still working on that presentation?

1024
00:52:14,249 --> 00:52:16,587
The presentation is today. I don't have much time left.

1025
00:52:16,588 --> 00:52:17,986
Still, you should take a little break.

1026
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,472
What if you doze off during the presentation?

1027
00:52:20,729 --> 00:52:21,851
Maybe.

1028
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:25,469
Then I'll take a nap for just 30 minutes.

1029
00:52:31,869 --> 00:52:33,031
This is nice.

1030
00:52:34,269 --> 00:52:35,808
I should probably set an alarm.

1031
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,037
Mr, Cha, what did you think?

1032
00:52:57,099 --> 00:52:58,180
Mr. Cha.

1033
00:52:58,769 --> 00:52:59,850
What?

1034
00:53:00,099 --> 00:53:02,547
I called you, but you didn't answer.

1035
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:05,966
I was thinking.

1036
00:53:06,468 --> 00:53:09,232
No. I completely passed out.

1037
00:53:09,909 --> 00:53:12,765
Both your nostrils are running now.

1038
00:53:12,849 --> 00:53:13,930
What?

1039
00:53:16,218 --> 00:53:17,372
Oh, this.

1040
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:20,445
Like I said, it's because I'm concentrating.

1041
00:53:20,689 --> 00:53:23,718
Both my nostrils start running when I'm completely concentrating.

1042
00:53:24,019 --> 00:53:26,680
Well, let's take a 10-minute break.

1043
00:53:28,488 --> 00:53:30,671
You guys look so tired.

1044
00:53:30,798 --> 00:53:32,360
I'm fine.

1045
00:53:32,499 --> 00:53:33,589
We can continue.

1046
00:53:34,968 --> 00:53:39,168
No way. Taking a break makes you more efficient.

1047
00:53:39,169 --> 00:53:41,586
Then let me take a bathroom break.

1048
00:53:45,579 --> 00:53:47,777
Are you really okay?

1049
00:53:47,778 --> 00:53:49,615
You don't look so well.

1050
00:53:49,818 --> 00:53:52,400
What are you talking about? I'm totally fine.

1051
00:53:53,789 --> 00:53:54,911
Gosh!

1052
00:53:56,619 --> 00:53:57,740
What's wrong?

1053
00:53:57,988 --> 00:54:00,130
Who... Who's that man?

1054
00:54:02,459 --> 00:54:04,059
What? Who are you talking about?

1055
00:54:04,258 --> 00:54:07,532
The man dressed in black.

1056
00:54:08,068 --> 00:54:10,313
- You don't see him? - What?

1057
00:54:11,139 --> 00:54:13,250
I don't see anyone. Is someone there?

1058
00:54:20,108 --> 00:54:21,638
Maybe I'm mistaken.

1059
00:54:21,979 --> 00:54:23,712
You're being a bit weird today.

1060
00:54:24,318 --> 00:54:25,471
Hold on.

1061
00:54:27,289 --> 00:54:28,675
It's so hot.

1062
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,458
You have a fever.

1063
00:54:30,459 --> 00:54:34,059
That's not it. My body temperature is always a bit high.

1064
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,958
- I'm fine. - No, you're not.

1065
00:54:36,959 --> 00:54:39,142
You have a high fever and a runny nose.

1066
00:54:39,829 --> 00:54:42,388
You're sick, aren't you?

1067
00:54:42,798 --> 00:54:46,607
Well... I might actually be coming down with...

1068
00:54:46,608 --> 00:54:49,801
a bit of a cold. Just a little bit.

1069
00:54:49,809 --> 00:54:50,962
I knew it.

1070
00:54:51,209 --> 00:54:54,136
You seemed to want to finish early today.

1071
00:54:54,178 --> 00:54:56,078
After scolding me for being unprofessional...

1072
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:59,107
and bad at taking care of myself.

1073
00:55:00,389 --> 00:55:03,684
Min Ah, a professional can get sick too.

1074
00:55:03,889 --> 00:55:08,244
Whether or not you can put up with the pain...

1075
00:55:09,329 --> 00:55:10,725
It's him again.

1076
00:55:12,729 --> 00:55:14,967
What? Who?

1077
00:55:14,968 --> 00:55:16,427
The Grim Reaper.

1078
00:55:18,939 --> 00:55:20,234
This is not okay.

1079
00:55:20,338 --> 00:55:23,107
Since you're feeling so bad, let's just call it a day.

1080
00:55:23,108 --> 00:55:24,199
What?

1081
00:55:24,809 --> 00:55:26,788
What are you talking about? I'm a professional.

1082
00:55:27,108 --> 00:55:28,301
I can continue.

1083
00:55:28,378 --> 00:55:30,047
Stop being so stubborn.

1084
00:55:30,048 --> 00:55:32,568
You're even seeing things. You can't continue recording.

1085
00:55:33,488 --> 00:55:35,630
Shall we start again?

1086
00:55:36,659 --> 00:55:39,750
I'm sorry, but my enteritis is back again.

1087
00:55:39,988 --> 00:55:42,202
Can we wrap up here?

1088
00:55:42,258 --> 00:55:44,441
Well, I see.

1089
00:55:45,159 --> 00:55:47,575
Well... Mr. Cha.

1090
00:55:48,329 --> 00:55:51,697
- What should we do? - Well...

1091
00:55:51,698 --> 00:55:53,034
I'm sorry.

1092
00:55:53,338 --> 00:55:55,827
I'm still not professional enough.

1093
00:55:56,378 --> 00:55:57,531
What?

1094
00:55:57,608 --> 00:55:59,751
Hey, what are you doing?

1095
00:55:59,778 --> 00:56:00,971
Do you want to continue then?

1096
00:56:04,048 --> 00:56:05,680
Min Ah, I'm sorry,

1097
00:56:06,019 --> 00:56:07,957
but can you walk me to the taxi stop?

1098
00:56:09,059 --> 00:56:10,518
I can't walk alone.

1099
00:56:10,519 --> 00:56:12,151
Gosh. All right.

1100
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:15,497
See you tomorrow then.

1101
00:56:15,729 --> 00:56:16,819
See you.

1102
00:56:19,928 --> 00:56:21,197
Let's walk fast.

1103
00:56:21,198 --> 00:56:22,668
Someone is following me.

1104
00:56:33,809 --> 00:56:36,195
Gosh. What if I'm really dying?

1105
00:56:37,778 --> 00:56:39,931
Who was following me, anyway?

1106
00:56:41,789 --> 00:56:44,817
Gosh. Why is he sleeping here?

1107
00:56:45,729 --> 00:56:47,462
- What should I do? - Soo Yeon.

1108
00:56:48,088 --> 00:56:49,252
What's wrong?

1109
00:56:49,459 --> 00:56:51,658
The presentation for the new segment is today,

1110
00:56:51,659 --> 00:56:53,331
but I dozed off, and I'm late now.

1111
00:56:53,729 --> 00:56:56,438
I didn't even practice enough. I don't know what to do.

1112
00:56:56,439 --> 00:56:57,520
What?

1113
00:57:01,309 --> 00:57:03,114
- I'll give you a ride. - You will?

1114
00:57:04,409 --> 00:57:06,693
You look a bit pale.

1115
00:57:06,878 --> 00:57:08,816
I'm fine. Don't worry.

1116
00:57:09,249 --> 00:57:11,799
- Are you sure? - I swear.

1117
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:13,650
You're late. Let's hurry up.

1118
00:57:13,718 --> 00:57:15,901
You can practice on the way.

1119
00:57:16,059 --> 00:57:17,853
Okay. Thank you.

1120
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:19,681
Let's go.

1121
00:57:28,628 --> 00:57:31,098
Thank you, Woo Shik. I'm on time thanks to you.

1122
00:57:31,099 --> 00:57:32,467
Don't mention it. Go on in.

1123
00:57:32,468 --> 00:57:34,100
Okay. Thanks again.

1124
00:57:35,139 --> 00:57:36,770
Good luck. You can do this!

1125
00:57:39,048 --> 00:57:40,885
What a relief. We made it in time.

1126
00:57:42,718 --> 00:57:43,872
Gosh, my headache.

1127
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:45,919
I should go and rest now.

1128
00:57:55,729 --> 00:57:56,952
Why am I so dizzy?

1129
00:58:01,329 --> 00:58:02,349
Mister.

1130
00:58:02,369 --> 00:58:04,138
- Are you okay? - Are you okay?

1131
00:58:04,139 --> 00:58:05,638
Call 911.

1132
00:58:05,639 --> 00:58:07,638
- Call 911. - Mister, can you hear me?

1133
00:58:07,639 --> 00:58:08,808
- Mister. - Mister?

1134
00:58:08,809 --> 00:58:09,931
- Are you okay? - Mister.

1135
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:19,801
I feel sick.

1136
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:23,850
I feel like I'm about to die.

1137
00:58:24,579 --> 00:58:26,589
Goodness, are you finally up?

1138
00:58:26,679 --> 00:58:27,741
What?

1139
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:29,078
Why did I sleep here?

1140
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:30,189
You don't remember?

1141
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:31,989
You said you'd make Min Jun drink...

1142
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:33,825
but you were the one who got drunk and fainted.

1143
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:36,089
You were spitting and yelling like a madman...

1144
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:38,069
and singing, and it was a total mess.

1145
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,158
Really? I did that?

1146
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:42,454
Yes, I'm telling you.

1147
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,015
Why are you so obsessed with that guy?

1148
00:58:45,429 --> 00:58:48,799
Are you jealous that Jung Eun is meeting another guy?

1149
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:49,861
What?

1150
00:58:51,139 --> 00:58:52,469
What are you talking about?

1151
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:55,571
I'm just worried Jung Eun might meet a weirdo and suffer.

1152
00:58:56,249 --> 00:58:57,330
How could you...

1153
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,113
I've never heard anything so ridiculous.

1154
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:03,288
That idiot...

1155
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:05,348
He could just say no. What's with the temper?

1156
00:59:05,349 --> 00:59:06,717
That rude jerk.

1157
00:59:08,619 --> 00:59:09,783
Hello?

1158
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:11,954
Cha Woo Shik?

1159
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:13,455
Yes, he's my brother.

1160
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,474
What? The hospital?

1161
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:23,190
Soo Yeon.

1162
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:25,651
There's a picture missing here.

1163
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:28,265
How did this happen?

1164
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:33,031
I saved it on the flash drive, but I forgot to copy it.

1165
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:35,395
I left the flash drive at home. What do I do?

1166
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:38,049
Then call your family and ask them to send it via email.

1167
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:40,365
Okay, I'll do that. Hold on.

1168
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:45,700
(Cha Woo Shik)

1169
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:51,969
The caller you have dialed is not available...

1170
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:53,162
Why isn't he answering?

1171
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:56,671
Shall I call Yu Ri then?

1172
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,301
Hello?

1173
01:00:01,809 --> 01:00:03,178
Yu Ri, it's me.

1174
01:00:03,179 --> 01:00:04,434
Are you at home right now?

1175
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:06,313
No, I'm at the hospital.

1176
01:00:06,579 --> 01:00:07,671
The hospital?

1177
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:09,100
Why?

1178
01:00:09,249 --> 01:00:10,819
Woo Shik fainted on the street...

1179
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:12,380
so I'm at the emergency room of Mirae Hospital.

1180
01:00:12,889 --> 01:00:13,634
What?

1181
01:00:14,059 --> 01:00:15,263
Woo Shik fainted?

1182
01:00:16,159 --> 01:00:17,792
He was fine just a moment ago.

1183
01:00:17,929 --> 01:00:18,949
What?

1184
01:00:19,229 --> 01:00:20,893
Was Woo Shik with you?

1185
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,960
I don't know anything specific yet.

1186
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:26,394
I'll call you back later.

1187
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:33,099
Soo Yeon.

1188
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:35,310
What's wrong? Is something wrong?

1189
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:38,771
Soo Yeon, where are you going?

1190
01:00:38,849 --> 01:00:40,618
The director will be arriving soon.

1191
01:00:40,619 --> 01:00:41,719
Soo Yeon!

1192
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:45,972
(Emergency Room)

1193
01:00:49,530 --> 01:00:50,652
My head hurts.

1194
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:53,646
Woo Shik, are you feeling better?

1195
01:00:53,929 --> 01:00:55,052
Hey, Yu Ri.

1196
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:57,394
Where am I?

1197
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,589
Where do you think? It's the hospital.

1198
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:02,660
The hospital?

1199
01:01:02,970 --> 01:01:03,969
Why am I here?

1200
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:06,080
You fainted in front of Soo Yeon's broadcasting station.

1201
01:01:06,539 --> 01:01:08,008
Why did you go there?

1202
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:11,949
Soo Yeon was late for a meeting...

1203
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:13,307
so I gave her a ride.

1204
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:14,500
What?

1205
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:17,319
Still, you were burning up from a severe fever.

1206
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:19,118
Why did you go there? You should've gone to the hospital.

1207
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:21,639
She was late for a very important presentation though.

1208
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,393
Goodness, I can't believe it.

1209
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:25,929
Do you know how scared I was because of you?

1210
01:01:25,959 --> 01:01:27,020
Sorry.

1211
01:01:27,959 --> 01:01:29,429
How did Soo Yeon's presentation go?

1212
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:32,354
Hey. Is this the time to be worried about her?

1213
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:35,474
You're so stupid.

1214
01:01:46,479 --> 01:01:49,049
Yu Ri, I think I'm really okay now.

1215
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:51,149
Let's go. It feels stuffy in here.

1216
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:53,668
Let's listen to what the doctor has to say first.

1217
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:55,696
Gosh, I feel so stuffy.

1218
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:05,428
Mr. Cha.

1219
01:02:05,429 --> 01:02:07,138
Min Ah, how did you come here?

1220
01:02:07,139 --> 01:02:09,862
She called you on your phone, so I contacted her.

1221
01:02:10,709 --> 01:02:14,005
Mr. Cha, are you really okay? Really?

1222
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,279
What?

1223
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,350
Of course. I'm okay now.

1224
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:20,319
What a relief. I'm so glad.

1225
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,888
Hey, what are you doing? Get off me.

1226
01:02:22,889 --> 01:02:25,748
No. Do you know how startled I was?

1227
01:02:25,749 --> 01:02:27,146
What's wrong with you?

1228
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:29,142
I told you I'm okay.

1229
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:32,179
I thought something bad happened.

1230
01:02:32,729 --> 01:02:34,463
I didn't even ask you out yet.

1231
01:02:34,729 --> 01:02:35,923
What? Ask who out?

1232
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:38,611
I like you.

1233
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:41,090
What?

1234
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:18,890
(Welcome to Waikiki 2 / Eulachacha Waikiki 2)

1235
01:03:19,479 --> 01:03:20,908
Mr. Cha, I'm here.

1236
01:03:20,909 --> 01:03:22,009
I know this may look a bit unusual.

1237
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:24,279
But I really, really like Mr. Cha.

1238
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:26,248
Soo Yeon and I are just friends now.

1239
01:03:26,249 --> 01:03:27,879
I'm glad you got over her.

1240
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,689
"Just 1 Minute"? Is this the song Woo Shik wrote?

1241
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:32,419
Jun Ki, where is Woo Shik right now?

1242
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:34,058
He said he was going to the studio and left.

1243
01:03:34,059 --> 01:03:35,058
- Ki Bong. - Who is she?

1244
01:03:35,059 --> 01:03:36,458
She's a new part-timer at a bakery nearby.

1245
01:03:36,459 --> 01:03:37,458
I'll be back soon.

1246
01:03:37,459 --> 01:03:39,728
"Meet me at the place we met yesterday?"

1247
01:03:39,729 --> 01:03:40,828
Is Ki Bong cheating on me?

1248
01:03:40,829 --> 01:03:43,498
Ki Bong, who is this girl? Tell me who she is!

1249
01:03:43,499 --> 01:03:44,728
Where are you going dressed up so early?

1250
01:03:44,729 --> 01:03:46,069
I'm going on a date with Min Jun.

1251
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:47,899
- Again? - You should date someone too then.

1252
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:49,638
I'll close my eyes and count to three.

1253
01:03:49,639 --> 01:03:51,509
The girl standing in front of me will be the girl of my life.

1254
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:53,580
1, 2, 3.

1255
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:55,850
Oh, gosh. What are you doing here?

1256
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:57,509
- Soo Yeon. - Dad.

1257
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:58,949
We're leaving on a flight tomorrow afternoon,

1258
01:03:58,950 --> 01:03:59,949
so pack your bags first.

1259
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:01,219
Do I really have to go?

1260
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:02,545
Will you let Soo Yeon go like this?
