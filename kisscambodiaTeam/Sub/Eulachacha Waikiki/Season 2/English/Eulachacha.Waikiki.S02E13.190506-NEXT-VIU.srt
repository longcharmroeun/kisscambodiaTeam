00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:12,322
It's late, so go on home.

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,551
Already?

3
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,478
Why don't we go and get a cup of coffee?

4
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:18,379
Why drink coffee at this hour?

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,673
Why? It's not even nine yet.

6
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:21,800
Let's go.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,930
Gosh.

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,088
I thought you didn't drink coffee.

9
00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:26,099
I do now.

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,251
My head.

12
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,421
Where am I?

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,432
Why does my room look so clean?

14
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,031
Who is this?

15
00:00:57,819 --> 00:00:59,738
You're so loud.

16
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,840
Ki Bong.

17
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,482
Be quiet and let me sleep.

18
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,038
What is this? What are you doing here?

19
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,121
I don't know either.

20
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,622
What on earth is going on?

21
00:01:20,779 --> 00:01:22,829
Hang on. Let me think.

22
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:25,739
Yesterday, my business went well,

23
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,978
so you and I had a drink in my room to celebrate.

24
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,459
You're so cute.

25
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,510
Gosh, stop it!

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,049
No way.

27
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,580
Then...

28
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,523
Did you and I...

29
00:01:53,339 --> 00:01:54,562
Yu Ri, I'm going in.

30
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,366
Hey, hide!

31
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,092
Yu Ri, this is an emergency.

32
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,760
What are you doing?

33
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,489
Do you know what time it is?

34
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,530
What a good night's sleep.

35
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:06,031
Who is that?

36
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,269
What?

37
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,528
Oh, it's my friend.

38
00:02:10,529 --> 00:02:12,318
Friend? Who?

39
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,784
Her name is Ki Soon.

40
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,381
You don't know her.

41
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,509
Really?

42
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,220
When did she come? I didn't see her arrive.

43
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,291
She came late last night...

44
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,579
when everyone was asleep.

45
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,055
Oh, I see.

46
00:02:27,339 --> 00:02:29,229
She must be really tall.

47
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,095
She has enormous feet.

48
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,860
That's because...

49
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,940
she used to be a basketball player.

50
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,248
Wow, an athlete?

51
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:38,688
So what brings you here?

52
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:41,158
Right. There's a leak in one of the guest's room ceiling,

53
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,746
and it's a total mess.

54
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,516
I'm looking for the source of the leak.

55
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:45,811
I need to look here too.

56
00:02:45,929 --> 00:02:46,970
Now?

57
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,518
- Can't you do it later? - No.

58
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,028
I already searched all the other rooms,

59
00:02:51,029 --> 00:02:52,453
and yours is the last one left.

60
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,590
The repair man is waiting outside, so get up.

61
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:56,121
Wake up your friend too.

62
00:02:56,369 --> 00:02:58,864
Okay, so wait outside.

63
00:02:58,939 --> 00:02:59,979
I'll change and go out.

64
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,191
Okay, hurry on out.

65
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:08,588
Yu Ri, what do we do now?

66
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:09,862
I don't know.

67
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,440
First of all, get dressed.

68
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:13,919
Get dressed!

70
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,703
Yu Ri, what's taking so long?

71
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,275
The repair man is waiting.

72
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:21,690
Okay, it'll only take a minute!

73
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:23,383
Get dressed faster!

74
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,299
What do I do now?

75
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,593
I don't know. Hide somewhere. Hide.

76
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,720
Over there.

77
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:32,491
Yu Ri, are you dressed?

78
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:34,051
We're going in.

79
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:36,965
What is taking you so long?

80
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:40,132
Why is she still in bed?

81
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,319
She came down with a bad flu, and she can barely move.

82
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,177
Really? Then what should we do?

83
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,348
We have to search the ceiling of this room too.

84
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,776
Then just go ahead.

85
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,158
She can stay here and sleep.

86
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,584
It's going to be noisy though.

87
00:03:54,929 --> 00:03:55,928
I guess there's no choice.

88
00:03:55,929 --> 00:03:57,081
Sir, you can begin.

89
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,438
Okay, I'll start over here.

90
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,116
Okay, I'll help you.

91
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,532
Should I put this here?

92
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,191
By the way, did you see Ki Bong?

93
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,820
Ki Bong?

94
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:10,348
- I didn't. - Where on earth is he?

95
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:11,733
I didn't see him all night.

96
00:04:12,749 --> 00:04:14,638
Didn't Ki Bong have a drink with you last night?

97
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,739
Yes. We did have a drink,

98
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,858
but he didn't drink much and left early.

99
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,072
- Did he? - Yes.

100
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:21,573
Should I call him?

101
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,048
The number you have dialed is not available...

102
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,552
His phone is turned off.

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,686
Where in the world is he?

104
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,930
Maybe he's at a friend's house.

105
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:40,170
Woo Shik, I'll hold the ladder. You must have other things to do.

106
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,926
Really? Thanks, then.

107
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:43,995
- Yu Ri! - Gosh, what?

108
00:04:44,109 --> 00:04:45,998
I have auditions tomorrow, so...

109
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,819
- Who's this? - It's her friend.

110
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,677
- Ki Soon. - Really?

111
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,319
But what's wrong with her?

112
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,784
She got a bad cold, so she's really sick.

113
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,455
- Anyway, thanks for the offer! - Sure.

114
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,329
Jung Eun. What is it that you needed?

115
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,329
- What is it? - I have auditions tomorrow.

116
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,499
Can I borrow your clothes?

117
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,668
Take whatever you need from the closet and go. Okay?

118
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:09,851
- Thanks, Yu Ri. - Sure.

119
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,918
Did you find the cause of the leak yet?

120
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,010
No, he's still working on it in Yu Ri's room.

121
00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:28,047
Why are you home so often these days?

122
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,413
- Aren't you shooting "Nice Man"? - It already ended.

123
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:32,728
They said I'd become a star in no time if I take part,

124
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:34,921
but no one's calling for me and I'm failing all the auditions, too.

125
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,882
It's so frustrating.

126
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,736
Yes, sir? What?

127
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,409
All right, sir! I'll be right there!

128
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,009
What's going on?

129
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,504
It's a director I know. He just told me to come and fill in for someone.

130
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:53,761
I'll get going.

131
00:05:56,349 --> 00:05:58,788
I guess I should go and finish arranging my song.

132
00:05:58,789 --> 00:05:59,870
Woo Shik!

134
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:05,556
- Didn't you have a shoot today? - No, it's my day off.

00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,441
Woo Shik...

136
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,055
- Here. - What's this?

137
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:13,451
Go on and open it.

138
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,550
All right.

(Kim Kwang Seok, Fourth Album)

140
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,011
- How did you... - I got my first salary,

141
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,634
so I got you a present.

142
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,970
You were really upset about this when it broke.

143
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:32,090
Thanks. It must have been hard to find and expensive.

144
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,537
No, it was quite easy.

145
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,879
Well, thanks. I'm really going to enjoy this.

146
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,071
It's nothing.

147
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:43,129
By the way, who was that girl with you last night?

148
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,211
Who?

149
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,283
Oh, Min Ah?

150
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:49,537
She's a kid I used to train.

151
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,495
She's having her debut soon.

152
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,659
She's going to be singing the song I made.

153
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:56,677
What? You're not the one singing it?

154
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:58,661
It just turned out that way.

155
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:03,125
I'm going to be busy producing for the kid.

156
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:05,805
I'll have to go up and get some work done.

157
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,149
- All right. - Thanks.

160
00:07:17,299 --> 00:07:19,391
You shouldn't be saying that to your teacher, kid.

161
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:24,143
All right. Come on over if you need to ask me anything.

162
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:29,108
Yu Ri. Which one do you think looks better?

163
00:07:29,109 --> 00:07:30,866
- They're both pretty. - Really?

164
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,978
I think this is a bit too sexy.

165
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:35,504
Then you should go with the other one.

166
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,019
But I like this design better.

167
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,259
- Then wear that one. - Come on, can't you try harder?

168
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,288
Gosh.

169
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:44,855

00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:02,591
Really?

174
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:05,231
Okay.

175
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,060
What's wrong?

176
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,612
I just got a call that there's smoke coming out of our food truck.

177
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,390
We left it at the park because Ki Bong had a drink.

178

- What do I do? - You should hurry up and go.

179

Gosh. I don't have time for that right now.

This is driving me crazy.

Hey, Ki Soon.

182
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,989
I'll be right back.

Jung Eun, could you hold the ladder for me?

185
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:36,309
Sure.

186
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,642
Don't let go, all right?

187
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:40,868
- Be careful. - Okay.

188
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:51,148
(Filming, "Behind the Very White Tower")

189
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:57,893
- Sir, I'm here. - Hey.

190
00:08:58,499 --> 00:09:00,039
I'm sorry for calling you in such short notice.

191
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,969
- One actor couldn't make it. - No worries, sir.

192
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:04,784
I'm grateful that you called for me.

193
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,028
What's the role, sir?

194
00:09:07,109 --> 00:09:10,241
Our main character is a doctor...

195
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,579
and you're going to be the husband of a lady he killed by mistake.

196
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,538
You're going to get revenge on the main character.

197
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,449
Oh, revenge!

198
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,581
- Go and have a look at the script. - Okay, sir.

199
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,031
- Here you go. - Thank you.

200
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,544
I've been wearing mascot suits all this time.

201
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,719
I guess I'm finally going to be doing some real acting.

202
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:27,911
Hello.

203
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:29,784
- Hello. - Hey.

204
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,060
- Jun Ki! - Hyun Sung?

205
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,809
Oh, that's right. You had the lead role of this show.

206
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,378
Yes. What are you doing here?

207
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,520
What?

208
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,508
I just got called in for someone who didn't make it.

209
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:45,934
You're going to be playing that role?

210
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,478
That's good news.

211
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:49,049
You two know each other?

212
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,534
Yes, he was my senior at college.

213
00:09:50,849 --> 00:09:51,959
What are you up to these days?

214
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,576
I saw you in the children's show some time ago.

215
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,370
What?

216
00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:00,090
I'm just doing some stuff here and there.

217
00:10:06,499 --> 00:10:08,591
Should we try rehearsing?

218
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,421
Sure, sir.

219
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:12,625
Let's see, then. Action!

220
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,983
Kang Jun Sang. This is all your fault.

221
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:21,062
You killed her.

222
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:23,569
You killed my Young Sook!

223
00:10:24,989 --> 00:10:26,333
Just you wait.

224
00:10:28,219 --> 00:10:30,249
I'm going to destroy you.

225
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,115
I'm going to destroy you!

226
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,967
You're great, Jun Ki.

227
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,638
Thank you, sir!

228
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:44,064
- Let's begin the shoot, then. - Yes, sir.

229
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,650
Sir, there's a problem.

230
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,949
- What's wrong? - We're missing a product shot.

231
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,449
We should have put it in the last episode, but I forgot.

232
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,308
Today's the last day of shooting. Why are you telling me this now?

233
00:10:54,849 --> 00:10:56,031
You're driving me crazy.

234
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:57,801
Which product is it?

235
00:10:57,989 --> 00:10:59,588
This, sir. The Super Vegetable Chopper.

236
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:00,758
The Super Vegetable Chopper...

237
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:04,228
The husband's supposed to get revenge on the doctor now.

238
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:05,799
How are we going to put that in?

239
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,446
But if we don't, we'll be violating the contract.

240
00:11:07,729 --> 00:11:09,385
- What do we do? - Violating the contract?

241
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,912
Gosh, what do we do?

242
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,520
What?

243
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,323
Ready...

244
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,462
Action!

245
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:32,890
Kang Jun Sang. This is all your fault.

246
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,832
You killed her.

247
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,479
You killed my Young Sook!

248
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:40,342
Just you wait.

249
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,172
I'm going to destroy you.

250
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,013
I'm going to destroy you!

251
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,199
I chopped it only five times,

252
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,105
but the picture's been cut exactly the way I wanted, equally.

253
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,852
Since it can even cut paper, it'll be perfect for vegetables.

254
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,346
Cut! Okay!

255
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,659
Let's move on to the mincing next.

256
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,487
- Sir... - Yes?

257
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,049
Do you think this will work out, though?

258
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,069
I don't think the chopper really fits in...

259
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,181
Why?

260
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:26,348
He's so furious that he's chopping the picture instead of ripping it.

261
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,294
Well, that's true, but...

262
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,165
don't you think it's a bit...

263
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,431
Is it too much for you?

264
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:34,669
Don't do it, then. If you don't want to see me ever again.

265
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:38,150
No, sir! I'll do it. I can do it.

266
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:40,171
Sure.

267
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,274
I hear the water.

268
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,318
I think it's somewhere here.

269
00:12:49,629 --> 00:12:50,913
- Really? - Yes.

270
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:54,098
I'll need to drill a hole and check on it with a camera.

271
00:12:54,099 --> 00:12:55,887
- Is that all right? - Sure, there's no other way.

272
00:12:55,969 --> 00:12:58,566
- Go ahead. - Where should I drill it?

273
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,605
Oh, no! Are you all right, miss?

274
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,779
Is she hurt? Go on and check on her.

275
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,931
Okay.

276
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,168
Ki Soon, are you all right?

277
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,172
Why isn't she answering?

278
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:13,934
Ki Soon, are you all right?

279
00:13:14,989 --> 00:13:17,150
I'm fine.

280
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,422
What's wrong with your voice?

281
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,051
I have a really bad cold.

282
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,022
I'm sorry for hurting you when you're so sick.

283
00:13:27,469 --> 00:13:29,086
It's all right, sir.

284
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:30,380
I'll have to start over.

285
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:37,198
What's going on? Why won't it drill?

286
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,703
The ceiling must be really firm.

287
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:47,250
Miss! I'm so sorry! Are you all right?

288
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,858
Yes. I'm fine.

289
00:13:52,859 --> 00:13:54,029
You should have been careful!

290
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,191
Are you all right, Ki Soon? Let me take a look.

291
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,541
No.

292
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,961
I'm fine.

293
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:02,360
I'm really okay.

294
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,939
I don't think she is.

295
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,111
I'm really fine!

296
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:10,026
Stop it!

297
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,293
Since the next scene is...

298
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,930
the husband going to the doctor's house to get revenge,

299
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,858
you have to really show the rage.

300
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:22,304
All right, sir.

301
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,659
Sir, we have a problem.

302
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,376
Again? What is it now?

303
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,029
Mi Seon refuses to shoot the product placement scene.

304
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,098
- Oh, my. - She endorses...

305
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:31,829
a rival brand, and it'd violate her contract.

306
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,539
Then ask another actor.

307
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,580
No one wants to.

308
00:14:36,469 --> 00:14:38,156
What is the product?

309
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:39,978
This. An LED mask.

310
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,625
- That's big. - An LED mask?

311
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,522
Who should we put this on?

312
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:49,999
What?

313
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,571
Ready.

314
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:55,800
Action!

315
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,250
Kang Jun Sang, wake up!

316
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,990
Wake up!

317
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,072
What is it? What's going on?

318
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,472
- Who are you? - What's wrong, honey?

319
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,560
Gosh!

320
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,607
Who are you? Tell me!

321
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:23,729
Do you remember...

322
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,876
a woman called Kim Young Sook?

323
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,073
Is that the one...

324
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:30,728
who was recently admitted for arrhythmia?

325
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,730
Yes. Because you were operating on a chairman,

326
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,799
her operation got delayed, and she died helplessly.

327
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,880
She's the one.

328
00:15:37,629 --> 00:15:38,649
I'm...

329
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:41,212
her husband.

330
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,221
Young Sook is...

331
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:47,011
now buried in the cold ground, where no sunshine reaches.

332
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:50,883
Meanwhile, your wife brightens her skin tone, reduces her wrinkles,

333
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,211
and firms up her skin with this LED mask?

334
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:58,998
Is that why she has skin like a newborn baby?

335
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,230
What do you want from me?

336
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,970
Your life.

337
00:16:08,229 --> 00:16:09,569
Die!

338
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,691
Cut! Okay!

339
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:16,781
That was some great acting.

340
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:17,951
Thank you.

341
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,119
Sir.

342
00:16:19,609 --> 00:16:21,108
Is this really okay?

343
00:16:21,109 --> 00:16:23,508
- What? - A man who wants to take revenge...

344
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:25,549
shows up wearing an LED mask?

345
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,630
What's wrong?

346
00:16:26,749 --> 00:16:28,919
The LED mask makes your eyes glow red,

347
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,940
making you look totally vicious.

348
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:33,309
Come on. Let's change the angle...

349
00:16:34,219 --> 00:16:35,401
and try again.

350
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:39,951
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

351
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,761
Am I shooting a drama or a commercial?

352
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,050
Woo Shik.

353
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,838
Do you want to go grocery shopping with me?

354
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:54,209
Let's get some hotteok on our way back home too.

355
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,401
I have to step out soon, sorry.

356
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,649
Min Ah will be in the neighborhood,

357
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,033
so we're eating together.

358
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,594
I see.

359
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:04,309
Too bad. I'll see you later.

360
00:17:06,019 --> 00:17:07,171
- Move! - My gosh.

361
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,659
What was that? Did someone just pass by me?

362
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,841
I think it was Yu Ri.

363
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,410
What's up with her?

364
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,699
Jung Eun.

365
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,768
You're back. How is your food truck?

366
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:21,214
There was a small fire,

367
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,409
but we put it out.

368
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,209
I can hold the ladder now.

369
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,249
You can go out.

370
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,489
Okay.

371
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:30,167
- Thanks for this. - Sure.

372
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:34,960
Ki Bong.

373
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,230
Ki Soon.

374
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:38,800
Are you okay?

375
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,999
You're bleeding.

376
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,251
Hey. What happened to your face?

377
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,147
There was a little accident.

378
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,286
What do we do now?

379
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,490
Let's sneak out now.

380
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:00,990
Yu Ri!

381
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,690
Yu Ri!

382
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,879
Yes? What?

383
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,048
Why are you so startled?

384
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:08,099
I'm not. What's the matter?

385
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,419
I was just wondering if we've found the leak.

386
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,540
Well, I'm not sure.

387
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:13,729
Have we?

388
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,102
It's here.

389
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:20,998
I've found the leak now.

390
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:21,998
What do we do next?

391
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:23,787
We'll have to remove some of the ceiling and repair the leak.

392
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:25,669
It'll take no more than 3 or 4 hours.

393
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,439
Then please start right away.

394
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,669
During the repair,

395
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,369
something might fall from the ceiling.

396
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,601
This lady will have to get up now.

397
00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:33,851
I see.

398
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,038
Let's wake her up and move her to another room.

399
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,867
What? Well...

400
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:43,018
But the thing is, Ki Soon is covered in sweat right now.

401
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:44,736
I think I'll change her clothes first.

402
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,389
Will you go out for a moment?

403
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,500
Sure.

404
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,378
- Let's go out for a moment. - Okay.

405
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,639
Yu Ri. What should we do now?

406
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,750
I don't know.

407
00:19:01,069 --> 00:19:04,099
What do we do? What do we do now?

408
00:19:04,739 --> 00:19:05,820
My goodness.

409
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:13,078
All right. This is our last scene. Let's finish it at one go.

410
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:14,161
- Yes! - Yes!

411
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,449
Ready.

412
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,137
Hold on! Sir.

413
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,482
What is it now? What happened?

414
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,284
I just got a call from the chief, and we have more products to shoot.

415
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,170
What?

416
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,770
More products?

417
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,018
We have only one scene left. What are you talking about?

418
00:19:29,229 --> 00:19:30,381
Tell him we can't.

419
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,494
He said you won't see him again if you say no.

420
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:34,579
What?

421
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,397
Gosh!

422
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,562
Ready.

423
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,460
Action!

424
00:20:03,729 --> 00:20:06,669
This is so fun. This is fantastic.

425
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,140
It balances automatically, so it feels extremely stable.

426
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,152
Too bad for you.

427
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:15,132
You won't be able to ride this fun thing ever again.

428
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,709
What's on your mind?

429
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,248
Sir, please let us go. Please!

430
00:20:20,249 --> 00:20:21,259
Be quiet!

431
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:28,371
Shut your mouth!

432
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,300
Shut it!

433
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:35,014
It's finally quiet again.

434
00:20:35,229 --> 00:20:37,798
I thought this thing just firms your face,

435
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,486
but it apparently has other uses too.

436
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:45,181
Do you want to live?

437
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,956
Then shake it more vigorously.

438
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:49,565
Until your face becomes slim!

439
00:20:49,809 --> 00:20:53,112
Show me how much you want to live! Come on!

440
00:20:58,249 --> 00:21:01,087
But why did you ignore my wife when she begged you to save her?

441
00:21:06,829 --> 00:21:08,648
I'm asking you, why did you ignore her?

442
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,683
You have nothing to say?

443
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:15,059
Then I guess it's time.

444
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,298
At a moment like this, we need some music.

445
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,220
Sinbad.

446
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:22,621
Yes, master.

447
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,603
Play a song you should listen to before you die.

448
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:29,486
Okay. I'll play you a song you should listen to before you die.

449
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,874
How smart is that?

450
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,129
It understood what I said perfectly...

451
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,078
and chose the most suitable song.

452
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,131
What do you think? Do you like the song?

453
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,396
I said, do you like the song?

454
00:21:57,509 --> 00:21:58,964
Time's up now.

455
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,560
Goodbye.

456
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,206
Wait, hold on.

457
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,776
I forgot to remove evidence.

458
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:13,464
They might find my DNA from my hair on the floor.

459
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,410
Give me just a second.

460
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,755
Cleaning starts.

461
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,449
This powerful cleaner is sucking up...

462
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,778
not just my hair...

463
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:33,143
but also all the fine dust accumulated in the apartment.

464
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:36,161
Perfect.

465
00:22:37,749 --> 00:22:40,992
Now let me get to work.

466
00:22:51,729 --> 00:22:52,810
Goodbye.

467
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:57,279
Cut!

468
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,427
Okay.

469
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:02,578
- Good work, everybody. - Thank you.

470
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:04,179
- Thank you. - Thank you.

471
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,320
Good work, Jun Ki.

472
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,966
You too. Thanks.

473
00:23:06,979 --> 00:23:10,218
It's been too long. Why don't we go for a drink?

474
00:23:10,219 --> 00:23:11,229
A drink?

475
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:14,079
I'm too tired today.

476
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,619
I'll have to pass.

477
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,801
All right.

478
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,177
Bye then.

479
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,226
What's taking so long?

480
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,939
This man is busy. Hurry up!

481
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,152
All right.

482
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,091
Gosh, you're tall.

483
00:23:39,579 --> 00:23:41,841
I'm sorry this happened when you don't feel well.

484
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:43,707
Please rest in another room.

485
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:46,159
No. Ki Soon is going home now.

486
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,359
She is? Are you sure you can take her home by yourself?

487
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,558
- Should I give you a ride? - No. I can do it alone.

488
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,129
I'm going out to meet someone anyway.

489
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,918
- Let me give you a ride. - I said no.

490
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,241
Mind your own business.

491
00:23:55,529 --> 00:23:58,761
Fine. I was just trying to help. Why did you have to yell?

492
00:23:58,829 --> 00:23:59,911
Well...

493
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:03,909
Ki Soon is very shy.

494
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,122
I see.

495
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:07,524
Take care.

496
00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:12,294
Let's go, Ki Soon.

497
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,660
Please.

498
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,459
- Are you okay? - She's fine.

499
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,682
Don't mind her and go. You can just go.

500
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,287
Ki Soon, are you all right?

501
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,143
Get up. Come on, get up.

502
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,614
It's okay. You're all good.

503
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,250
Wait.

504
00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:42,496
What is it, brother?

505
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:53,591
Here, she dropped her sunglasses and hat.

506
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:58,154
Oh, those? It's fine.

507
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,498
Just leave them there.

508
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,884
What are you talking about? These belong to Ki Soon.

509
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:04,399
I said it's fine.

510
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,218
- What do we do? - Ki Bong.

511
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,780
Run!

512
00:25:10,569 --> 00:25:12,326
- Oh, gosh. - Hey, wait!

513
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,679
- Ki Soon, take this. - She doesn't need the hat.

514
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,922
She doesn't need it.

515
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:18,361
It's okay.

516
00:25:19,749 --> 00:25:21,496
What? Why?

517
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:23,103
What is wrong with her?

518
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:28,119
I told you she is a very shy person.

519
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,018
How shy could she be to jump from the second floor?

520
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:32,810
What if she got hurt?

521
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:34,141
She'll be okay.

522
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,751
She's a very athletic person.

523
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,495
Gosh, my leg.

524
00:25:50,979 --> 00:25:54,414
Darn it. How will I get along with Yu Ri from now on?

525
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:57,672
I'll spend the night at a sauna and go home tomorrow.

526
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:00,119
Before anyone catches me,

527
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,240
I need to get as far away from here as possible.

528
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,002
I need to hurry.

529
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:05,501
Goodness, my leg.

530
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:10,133
I was frightened to death that Woo Shik might find out.

531
00:26:11,829 --> 00:26:13,051
I wonder if Ki Bong is okay.

532
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,913
I hope he escaped safely.

533
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,447
By the way, how could I do something so stupid?

534
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,508
What will happen to Ki Bong and me now?

535
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:23,469
This is driving me crazy.

536
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,330
Goodness me.

537
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,037
I was so excited about this new role.

538
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,437
But what on earth is this?

539
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,510
I'm thankful they gave it to me as a gift,

540
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,514
but what would I use this for?

541
00:26:41,329 --> 00:26:44,431
I'll give this to Jung Eun. Jung Eun will like it.

542
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,852
Goodness, my leg.

543
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:52,735
My leg. I thought I was hit by a car.

544
00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:58,283
Miss, you should watch where you're going.

545
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,788
- Miss, are you okay? - This is driving me crazy.

546
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,304
What do I do?

547
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:10,108
Miss, can you get up?

548
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,000
Miss.

549
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,028
Wait. Miss, where are you going?

550
00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:17,403
Miss, wait. Miss, miss!

551
00:27:17,499 --> 00:27:20,266
That is my mask. This one is yours!

552
00:27:20,469 --> 00:27:22,055
You took the wrong mask!

553
00:27:23,969 --> 00:27:25,424
How could a woman be so fast?

554
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,033
Why did she take my LED mask?

555
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,849
- Here you go, Yu Ri. Jun Ki too. - Thank you.

556
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:36,800
Thanks.

557
00:27:38,249 --> 00:27:39,876
What are all these facial masks for?

558
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:44,399
I received my first paycheck a few days ago, and bought them as gifts.

559
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,589
I know it's nothing much.

560
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,841
No, this is great.

561
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,099
It's so cute.

562
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,443
Thank you for the gift.

563
00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:54,396
It's nothing compared to what you've all done for me.

564
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:58,642
This smells really nice, and it's totally my type.

565
00:27:58,769 --> 00:28:00,092
Thanks for the gift, Soo Yeon.

566
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:04,139
Darn. If it weren't for that giant lady last time,

567
00:28:04,509 --> 00:28:06,569
I could've given you an LED mask for a present.

568
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,179
What do you mean?

569
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,048
I received an LED mask as a gift at my shoot.

570
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:13,311
But this giant lady stole it on my way home.

571
00:28:13,989 --> 00:28:15,302
I'll find her one day.

572
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,177
I even have evidence.

573
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:19,516
By the way, where is Ki Bong?

574
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,372
He didn't come home yet.

575
00:28:21,729 --> 00:28:24,325
We have to open for business. Where has he gone suddenly?

576
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,720
Yu Ri, did Ki Bong call you?

577
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,173
- Yu Ri! - What? Why?

578
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,956
Did Ki Bong call you?

579
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:38,604
Why are you asking me that? I don't know either.

580
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,070
Just say you don't know. Why are you getting angry?

581
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:43,861
Yu Ri, did you...

582
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,231
fight with Ki Bong again?

583
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,208
Is that why he isn't coming home? Am I right?

584
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,643
You're wrong.

585
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,153
Ki Bong. Where have you been all this time?

586
00:28:55,499 --> 00:28:58,228
What? I was at a friend's house.

587
00:28:58,229 --> 00:29:00,968
You should've called then. We were worried about you.

588
00:29:00,969 --> 00:29:04,544
Sorry. I'm feeling tired, so I'll go get some sleep.

589
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,633
Me too. I'm feeling tired too.

590
00:29:13,249 --> 00:29:14,694
What is wrong with those two?

591
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:17,639
It's obvious they fought again.

592
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,446
It's so awkward.

593
00:29:30,229 --> 00:29:31,886
I can't even look at Yu Ri's face.

594
00:29:32,529 --> 00:29:34,661
I have to help her with the food truck later. What do I do?

595
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,228
How could I make such a stupid mistake?

596
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,639
But was it really a mistake?

597
00:29:45,579 --> 00:29:47,903
Does that mean that I like Yu Ri?

598
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:53,936
This is insane.

599
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,503
How could I sleep with Ki Bong?

600
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,910
Why? For what reason?

601
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:02,068
Well, Yu Ri is very outgoing and pretty.

602
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,618
She comforted me when I was kicked out of my team.

603
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:06,312
She is a nice person.

604
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,025
Well, it's true Ki Bong is nice...

605
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,654
and he looks cute too.

606
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:13,778
On top of that, he used his last salary...

607
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:15,294
and bought me that food truck.

608
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:21,849
Still, I've never thought of Ki Bong as a man.

609
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:24,778
I've never thought of Yu Ri as a woman.

610
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,030
Then...

611
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,878
does Yu Ri like me?

612
00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:33,888
Then does Ki Bong like me?

613
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:36,616
What should I do if it's true?

614
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,583
He's making things so complicated.

615
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,137
Gosh, this is such a pickle.

616
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,278
This tastes nice.

617
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,824
I knew it wouldn't go well when they said they'd work together,

618
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,189
when they bicker all the time.

619
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,758
Why did they fight this time?

620
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:04,113
I don't know either. They both didn't tell me.

621
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,005
It's probably over nothing.

622
00:31:06,229 --> 00:31:07,340
Just don't mind them.

623
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,451
Hello?

624
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,480
Yes, speaking.

625
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:22,239
Oh, hey. Why are you calling me?

626
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:25,882
Jun Ki. Are you free for an audition today?

627
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,290
An audition?

628
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,078
What audition?

629
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:32,221
There's a spot left for a movie that I'll be shooting soon.

630
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,348
I recommended you to the director, and he wants to see you today.

631
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:39,460
Really? I'd really appreciate that.

632
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,280
Okay. I'll get ready and head over.

633
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:43,911
Okay.

634
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,268
What is it? Are you going to an audition?

635
00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:47,511
Who recommended you?

636
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:50,295
What? It's Hyun Sung.

637
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:52,451
Hyun Sung?

638
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:54,860
Are you talking about Kim Hyun Sung from college?

639
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,513
Yes. I bumped into him at a shoot yesterday.

640
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:02,449
Jun Ki, don't you remember how much he made a fool of you before?

641
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,369
Do you still want to go to an audition he introduces?

642
00:32:04,819 --> 00:32:06,204
It's all in the past.

643
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:08,030
I'll see you later.

644
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,341
Why? What's this about?

645
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:15,146
What do you mean, he made a fool of Jun Ki?

646
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:16,541
Well...

647
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,443
Do you know the actor, Kim Hyun Sung?

648
00:32:18,529 --> 00:32:19,579
Yes, I do.

649
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,183
He's very popular these days.

650
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,035
- Was he your junior in college? - Yes.

651
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:27,278
Actually, Jun Ki was cast as the male lead of...

652
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,199
a movie a long time ago.

653
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,407
But that jerk used his connections to take his role.

654
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,030
The title of the movie was "Nineteen".

655
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,632
"Nineteen"?

656
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,565
Isn't that a very famous movie?

657
00:32:38,219 --> 00:32:40,459
So Jun Ki was the original lead of that movie?

658
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,672
Yes, I'm telling you.

659
00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:44,542
Doesn't he even feel angry?

660
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,812
Gosh, that idiot.

661
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,810
A country.

662
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:54,888
What is a country to you?

663
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,622
I know.

664
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,821
I know very well.

665
00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:01,026
Clause 1-2 of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea.

666
00:33:01,539 --> 00:33:04,479
The sovereignty lies with the people and all rights belong to the people.

667
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,092
A country is its people!

668
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,195
But what is a country to you?

669
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,242
Does it belong to the soldiers who robbed this country's sovereignty?

670
00:33:12,049 --> 00:33:13,403
Is that what it means to you?

671
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:16,944
Tell me the truth.

672
00:33:19,329 --> 00:33:21,278
Do you call this true patriotism?

673
00:33:22,829 --> 00:33:24,568
Thank you. That will be all.

674
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:28,074
Great job. I understand why Hyun Sung recommended you.

675
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,426
- Thank you. - All right.

676
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:33,335
- I look forward to your great work. - Sorry?

677
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:38,518
Does that mean you're casting me right now?

678
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,478
For such a huge role?

679
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:42,641
Why? You don't want the role?

680
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:46,842
No, not at all. I'd love to do it.

681
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,883
Thank you. I'll try my best, sir!

682
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:53,624
Thank you. Thank you so much.

683
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:55,498
I really appreciate it.

684
00:33:55,499 --> 00:33:59,337
(Even If the World Deceives You)

685
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:01,899
Hello, I'm Han Soo Yeon of Report Special Force.

686
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,910
I'm here at Yangyang to see a very special cat today.

687
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,298
I'm here at Yangyang...

688
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:11,078
- Do you need any help? - It's okay.

689
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:13,241
You must be busy preparing for your show. Keep practicing.

690
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,535
What are you shooting tomorrow?

691
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:18,475
I heard there's a talking cat at Yangyang, Gangwon Province.

692
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,040
- A talking cat? - Yes.

693
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,078
When it wakes up in the morning, it stands in front of the door...

694
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,249
and cries, "Let me out, let me out."

695
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:27,076
Really? Then does it say,

696
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,179
"Let me in, let me in," too?

697
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:31,143
That's right. It does.

698
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:34,089
- Really? - And when it's hungry,

699
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,391
it says, "I'm hungry, I'm hungry."

700
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,691
Wow, a cat can really do that?

701
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,049
Mr. Cha!

702
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,268
Why are you here?

703
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:46,733
Woo Shik, who's she?

704
00:34:46,979 --> 00:34:49,504
She's a student I used to train.

705
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:52,273
Nice to meet you. I'm Choi Min Ah.

706
00:34:53,019 --> 00:34:54,130
Nice to meet you.

707
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,359
What are you doing here?

708
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,428
I have a few questions...

709
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,671
about the song you wrote.

710
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,069
Is that so?

711
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,382
Let's go up to my studio.

712
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,013
The studio is too stuffy.

713
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,939
Let's go outside. The weather's really nice.

714
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,109
Ice cream's on me.

715
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,908
What? Ice cream's for children.

716
00:35:13,909 --> 00:35:15,354
I want some ice cream.

717
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,167
- Come on, let's go. - Hey, stop that.

718
00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:18,489
Come on!

719
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:22,730
Have fun!

720
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,118
Soo Yeon, don't you think that girl...

721
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,907
likes Woo Shik?

722
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,970
What?

723
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,149
I don't know.

724
00:35:30,389 --> 00:35:32,046
I'm 100 percent sure of it.

725
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:34,117
I'm really good with things like this.

726
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,380
Yes, Jun Ki?

727
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,230
What? You got it? Really?

728
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,550
Yes.

729
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,525
That's what I'm telling you!

730
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,509
I'm playing the counterpart to the lead actor...

731
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:51,409
and it's a big role and a really good character.

732
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:54,379
This isn't a dream, right?

733
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,518
You should try pinching yourself, then.

734
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:58,712
Pinching myself? All right, then.

735
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,931
Oh, no.

736
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,217
It hurts! It hurts so much!

737
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:07,147
It's not a dream!

738
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,640
Are you that happy?

739
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,557
Sure. I'm happy. I'm so happy. It's the best day of my life.

740
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,899
Hey, I'll be home soon.

741
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,415
Let's go grab a drink to celebrate.

742
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,862
All right, then. See you.

743
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:23,962
- Sir. - What?

744
00:36:24,479 --> 00:36:26,298
Are you sure about Jun Ki?

745
00:36:27,179 --> 00:36:28,997
What else can we do?

746
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:32,251
He doesn't have much experience. Isn't it too big of a role?

747
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,436
I'm worried about that, too,

748
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,219
but Hyun Sung said he won't do it...

749
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,845
if I don't give Jun Ki the role.

750
00:36:38,059 --> 00:36:40,584
We'll be in trouble if we offend him and he refuses to star.

751
00:36:40,729 --> 00:36:42,922
That's why those who pull strings to get a role is a problem.

752
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,444
They're so cheap and nasty.

753
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,819
So...

754
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:58,692
should we begin?

755
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:01,033
Sure. Okay.

756
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,009
Wait, Yu Ri.

757
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:08,010
What is it?

758
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,650
About what happened...

759
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,216
It was...

760
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,013
a mistake, right?

761
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,319
What? A mistake?

762
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:19,984
It was a mistake?

763
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,918
He didn't have feelings for me?

764
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:26,063
Fine. It's better off this way.

765
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,338
Sure. Of course it was a mistake.

766
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,395
It was just the alcohol.

767
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:34,881
Let's just forget about it.

768
00:37:35,479 --> 00:37:37,167
Forget about it?

769
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,641
Then she didn't have feelings for me?

770
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:41,575
Fine, then.

771
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,754
Sure. Let's forget about it.

772
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,615
Fine! Let's do that!

773
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,459
Shall we begin our business?

774
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,642
Fine!

776
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,340

777
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,210
Is that all it takes?

778
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:16,126
That guy has absolutely no sense of responsibility.

779
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,985
What? Forget about it?

780
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:23,420
Does she really think it's that simple?

781
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,667
She always has it easy, doesn't she?

782
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,851
What's this?

783
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,440
Hey, Kook Ki Bong.

784
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,109
You did this, didn't you?

785
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,209
What are you talking about?

786
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:36,408
There's pepper in the salt container.

787
00:38:36,409 --> 00:38:38,009
Is there? Sorry.

788
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,049
I guess it was a mistake.

789
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,060
What?

790
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,202
A mistake? It was a mistake?

791
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:46,859
Why is everything a mistake for you?

792
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,607
This was the first time.

793
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:51,428
Besides, you're the one in charge of the kitchen.

794
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:53,529
Dividing the role of kitchen and server...

795
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,246
was when business was low.

796
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,923
Just forget about it.

797
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,469
What? Forget about it?

798
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,753
You're telling me to forget about it?

799
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,189
Do you really think forgetting about things...

800
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:05,808
solves the problem?

801
00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:08,466
What? Why are you picking on me?

802
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:12,112
Whatever. Just cut it.

803
00:39:12,749 --> 00:39:14,264
That's what I wanted, too.

804
00:39:18,019 --> 00:39:19,649
Should we have a party...

805
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,158
since Jun Ki got the role?

806
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,332
Of course!

807
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,351
Jun Ki is really going to be a star now.

808
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,378
He's really had it rough until now.

809
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,316
I guess things are starting to get better for him.

810
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,081
I'm back.

811
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,899
How was the date?

812
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,161
That wasn't a date. We just had some coffee together.

813
00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:40,178
And I told you, she's just my student.

814
00:39:40,179 --> 00:39:42,502
She didn't seem like it.

815
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:46,339
I think she likes you.

816
00:39:46,409 --> 00:39:47,561
I'm positive.

817
00:39:47,749 --> 00:39:49,769
Be quiet! That's nonsense.

818
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,486
Mr. Cha! I got back home safely.

819
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,558
It was really nice seeing you. I hope to see you again soon.

820
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:03,277
Who is it? Is it Min Ah?

821
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:06,822
Yes. She's just telling me she got home.

822
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:09,109
What's this?

823
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,480
What is this?

824
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:12,169
What is it? Let me see.

825
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,408
(W, S, L, I, W, S, O, G)

826
00:40:13,409 --> 00:40:14,723
Why did she only send the first letters?

827
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,793
What does it mean?

828
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,690
Maybe...

829
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:19,819
Maybe what?

830
00:40:20,249 --> 00:40:21,879
Kids these days...

831
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,649
send first letters...

832
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,810
to say what they really think, like a code.

833
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,018
What? That's nonsense.

834
00:40:29,019 --> 00:40:31,180
Come on. Give it to me. I'll try to decipher it.

835
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,149
Decipher what?

836
00:40:33,429 --> 00:40:34,712
It's not like that.

837
00:40:37,499 --> 00:40:38,711
You're talking nonsense.

838
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:41,939
Hey, I'm telling you. I can sense it!

839
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,010
Hey!

840
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,764
It's true. I'm sure of it.

842
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,567
Why won't this come off, already?

843
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,141
Why won't this unfold, already?

844
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:01,630
Excuse me...

845
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,788
Would you like to order?

846
00:41:03,789 --> 00:41:06,587
- The menu's over there... - No, that's not it!

847
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,223
I wanted to give you this.

848
00:41:10,269 --> 00:41:12,218
Oh, thank you.

849
00:41:12,769 --> 00:41:14,469
Aren't you Kook Ki Bong?

850
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,098
The MVP of the High School Baseball Tournament.

851
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:18,494
I was a fan since high school.

852
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,120
Really?

853
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:22,256
I didn't know I still had fans.

854
00:41:23,479 --> 00:41:25,499
This is my business card.

855
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,708
I'd like to buy you dinner sometime.

856
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:30,933
I'd appreciate that.

857
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:32,989
- Your name is Bo Ra? - Yes.

858
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,219
Thank you.

859
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,419
I didn't know I still had fans.

860

Hey, Kook Ki Bong!

861
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,388
Aren't you here to work?

862
00:41:38,389 --> 00:41:39,428
Come on.

863
00:41:39,429 --> 00:41:41,799
I cleared everything and set up the tables.

864
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,376
Do you think that's it?

865
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,299
You need to organize the sauce containers...

866
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,289
and the chopsticks.

867
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:49,483
And also, swat away the flies!

868
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:52,209
Fine, all right.

869
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,926
What are you getting mad at me for?

870
00:41:55,909 --> 00:41:57,549
Thank you for the drink.

871
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,690
Sure.

872
00:41:58,979 --> 00:42:01,303
- See you again, then. - Okay.

873
00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:03,379

Ta-da!

877
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,928
Isn't that Woo Shik's phone?

878
00:42:15,929 --> 00:42:18,757
It is. He was asleep, so I took it from him.

879
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:19,998
Why?

880
00:42:19,999 --> 00:42:22,393
I wanted to decipher the message Min Ah sent.

881
00:42:22,769 --> 00:42:25,900
I'm positively sure that she was confessing her feelings for him.

882
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,123
Do you want to help?

883
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,609
What? No, thank you.

884
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:32,731
I have a lot to do and I don't care for it.

885
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:34,767
Do you? Okay, then.

886
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,911
Let me see...

887
00:42:40,389 --> 00:42:41,399
Here it is.

888
00:42:41,889 --> 00:42:43,747
W, S, L...

889
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,573
I wonder what this is.

890
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,410
Maybe it's this?

891
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:53,130
"Bruce Lee's abs are scary, Journey to the West."

892
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:58,448
"I'll give you Bruce Lee's lottery, shower."

893
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:01,227
Maybe it's not Bruce Lee.

894
00:43:02,139 --> 00:43:04,603
Then what can it be?

895
00:43:06,349 --> 00:43:07,965
Maybe it's "badger"?

896
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:11,118
Maybe it's a different word?

897
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,301
Do you think so?

898
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,900
W, S...

899
00:43:15,019 --> 00:43:17,857
I thought you weren't interested?

900
00:43:19,929 --> 00:43:21,949
I'm not,

901
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,217
but I got curious since you kept talking about it.

902
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,439
Really?

903
00:43:25,729 --> 00:43:28,668
What do you think starts with "W" and "S"?

904
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:32,049
Wait a minute.

905
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,920
"Woo Shik"?

906
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:36,761
That's right, it's "Woo Shik"!

907
00:43:37,309 --> 00:43:38,391
It's "Woo Shik".

908
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:45,919
- Yu Ri. - Yes?

909
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,102
Would you like to try some of this?

910
00:43:48,889 --> 00:43:49,989
Thank you.

911
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:51,171
It's nothing.

912
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:52,759
I'm not sure if you'll like it.

913
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,416
- It looks delicious. - Thank you.

914
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:55,910
I...

915
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,959
Would you like to grab a beer with me sometime?

916
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,461
Beer? Sure!

917
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,439
I love beer.

918
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,490
- Me too. - Do you?

919
00:44:05,869 --> 00:44:07,009
Why aren't you working?

920
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:08,191
Did you finish preparing the ingredients?

921
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:09,820
Of course!

922
00:44:10,449 --> 00:44:12,672
Really? How much did you prepare?

923
00:44:12,949 --> 00:44:13,989
100 portions.

924
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:16,434
That won't do!

925
00:44:16,479 --> 00:44:17,662
Prepare 200!

926
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:19,504
What? 200 portions?

927
00:44:19,889 --> 00:44:22,141
What if we don't get that many customers?

928
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,785
How can you think we won't get many customers?

929
00:44:25,059 --> 00:44:26,998
There's no guarantee we will.

930
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:29,251
I have a feeling.

931
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,854
If we don't, I'll buy everything that's left.

932
00:44:31,999 --> 00:44:33,485
So prepare more ingredients right now.

933
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:35,452
Fine.

934
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,009
I will.

935
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,252
Why are you so upset?

936
00:44:38,869 --> 00:44:40,828
- Thank you. - No problem.

937
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:42,121
It looks so tasty.

938
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:46,364
Shouldn't you go back and get ready?

939
00:44:46,909 --> 00:44:48,294
Do you have so much time?

940
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:49,962
Oh, okay.

941
00:44:55,690 --> 00:45:01,316
("The Mean Game")

942
00:45:02,059 --> 00:45:03,210
Hyun Sung.

943
00:45:05,699 --> 00:45:06,983
What are you doing here?

944
00:45:07,769 --> 00:45:11,609
Oh, right. The director told me he cast you.

945
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:13,387
- Congratulations. - "Congratulations"?

946
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,420
On what?

947
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,622
What are you congratulating me on?

948
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:19,549
What's wrong?

949
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,135
You asked the director to cast me.

950
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:25,417
Why did you do that? Why?

951
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:28,815
- How did you... - That's none of your business.

952
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,506
Just tell me why you did that.

953
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:36,796
I just thought the role would suit you very well.

954
00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:38,884
Also, I owed you one.

955
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:42,905
You owed me one? And when did I tell you to pay me back?

956
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:45,525
Anyway, I can't work like this.

957
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:48,124
You tell the director...

958
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:50,320
I'm leaving.

959
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,622
You haven't changed a bit.

960
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:59,719
- What? - Isn't it tiring...

961
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,406
to be so righteous all the time?

962
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,629
You think I'm a jerk who stole your role using connections.

963
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,944
But I don't regret it.

964
00:46:09,329 --> 00:46:12,127
Without that role, I wouldn't have made it this far.

965
00:46:12,729 --> 00:46:13,811
What did you say?

966
00:46:16,539 --> 00:46:18,155
You piece of scum.

967
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:20,222
Yes, I'm a piece of scum.

968
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,828
But look where being righteous got you.

969
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,779
You still only get minor roles and fill in for others all the time.

970
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,339
Pride won't feed you.

971
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,942
And everyone else knows that.

972
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:35,419
No matter how hard you try to be righteous,

973
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,308
no one will ever recognize it.

974
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,871
You know that, don't you?

975
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:41,311
Anyway,

976
00:46:42,429 --> 00:46:44,217
we're even now.

977
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,610
So continue living your unimpressive life or take that role.

978
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:52,883
It's your choice.

979
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:12,399
(Yu Ri's Kitchen 31)

980
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,795
I don't think we're getting more customers. Let's pack up.

981
00:47:15,141 --> 00:47:16,282
All right.

982
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:19,808
But I'm not going home with you today.

983
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,265
What? You're not coming with me?

984
00:47:22,511 --> 00:47:26,157
I'm going to grab a beer with the guy from the next truck.

985
00:47:26,351 --> 00:47:27,562
You go home first.

986
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:28,812
What?

987
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,634
- Go ahead. - Thank you.

988
00:47:38,551 --> 00:47:40,380
Bo Ra, let's drink.

989
00:47:40,381 --> 00:47:41,461
Sure.

990
00:47:44,191 --> 00:47:46,676
I can't believe I'm drinking with the famous Kook Ki Bong.

991
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:48,909
It's such an honor.

992
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,808
You flatter me.

993
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:53,849
Hey, let's drink.

994
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:55,344
- Sure. - Here we go.

995
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,943
- Cheers. - Cheers.

996
00:48:00,971 --> 00:48:03,769
By the way, what's the relation between you...

997
00:48:03,971 --> 00:48:05,627
and that girl?

998
00:48:07,841 --> 00:48:10,880
She's just my friend's sister. My friend's sister.

999
00:48:11,711 --> 00:48:13,409
She's his older sister,

1000
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:16,683
but she is never of any help to him.

1001
00:48:16,821 --> 00:48:18,003
Never.

1002
00:48:19,191 --> 00:48:22,149
Ki Bong is your brother's friend?

1003
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:24,990
You guys looked so close,

1004
00:48:24,991 --> 00:48:26,506
so I thought you two were dating.

1005
00:48:26,631 --> 00:48:27,711
What?

1006
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:29,760
- Me dating him? - Yes.

1007
00:48:29,761 --> 00:48:31,821
That's absurd.

1008
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,626
He is the complete opposite of my type.

1009
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,573
I would never date a guy like him in my life.

1010
00:48:41,211 --> 00:48:45,150
Bo Ra, I hope you didn't get the wrong idea.

1011
00:48:45,211 --> 00:48:47,979
She is the type I hate the most.

1012
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:50,304
She is short-tempered, shameless, and mean.

1013
00:48:51,051 --> 00:48:53,576
She is the absolute worst. The worst!

1014
00:48:55,321 --> 00:48:57,513
Do you know what he is like?

1015
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:58,873
He is...

1016
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:03,659
Recently on "Challenge! King of Quiz", he said "Euljimun Quack"...

1017
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:06,023
- instead of "Euljimundeok". - I see.

1018
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:09,570
I can't remember how many times she stole our money back in school.

1019
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,258
- And... - Hold on.

1020
00:49:11,941 --> 00:49:15,172
Can you talk about something else...

1021
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:17,875
than her?

1022
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:20,101
Oh, I'm sorry.

1023
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,498
It was rude of me.

1024
00:49:23,721 --> 00:49:26,376
There you go again. You made yet another mistake.

1025
00:49:26,591 --> 00:49:28,379
Your whole life is full of mistakes.

1026
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,358
You petty jerk with no sense of responsibility!

1027
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:34,354
What? "Petty"? Are you done?

1028
00:49:34,961 --> 00:49:37,121
No, I'm not. What are you going to do?

1029
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,183
Fine, forget it.

1030
00:49:39,671 --> 00:49:43,277
Forget the food truck and everything!

1031
00:49:44,711 --> 00:49:47,236
What? You don't want to run the food truck anymore?

1032
00:49:49,011 --> 00:49:51,909
Fine. I'm short-tempered, shameless, and mean.

1033
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:53,901
Why would you want to run this with me?

1034
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,838
Quit if you want to. What a jerk.

1035
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,720
You started this.

1036
00:49:58,721 --> 00:50:01,083
Fine. I'm sorry.

1037
00:50:01,491 --> 00:50:04,045
I'm going home. Have fun.

1038
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:08,860
What are you doing?

1039
00:50:08,861 --> 00:50:11,194
Don't worry about me and have fun.

1040
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:17,381
But I do.

1041
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:20,522
What?

1042
00:50:23,011 --> 00:50:24,294
I care about you.

1043
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:27,001
So don't drink with another man.

1044
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,591
What did you say?

1045
00:50:33,191 --> 00:50:34,301
What about you?

1046
00:50:36,091 --> 00:50:37,847
You don't care about me?

1047
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:42,872
I do.

1048
00:50:45,031 --> 00:50:48,940
So don't smile at another girl.

1049
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,686
Don't be so nice to another girl.

1050
00:51:10,991 --> 00:51:12,949
- There's "high-rank" too. - "High-rank"?

1051
00:51:13,591 --> 00:51:15,099
(High-rank)

1052
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,374
Soo Yeon, is there anything more?

1053
00:51:17,571 --> 00:51:20,024
No. I'm pretty sure that's all.

1054
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:23,063
What if we combine these words?

1055
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:26,840
Let me read out a few combinations that make the most sense.

1056
00:51:26,841 --> 00:51:28,153
- Listen. - Okay.

1057
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:30,309
"Woo Shik. Ram Bo is..."

1058
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:32,098
"running. Murderer."

1059
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:34,192
That doesn't sound very...

1060
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,289
"Goat. Rambo is running."

1061
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:39,361
"Soyang River."

1062
00:51:39,491 --> 00:51:41,481
That sounds even weirder.

1063
00:51:42,591 --> 00:51:44,751
Could those combinations be wrong?

1064
00:51:45,031 --> 00:51:48,030
That can't be. These are the most likely ones.

1065
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,176
Gosh, I don't know anymore.

1066
00:51:51,401 --> 00:51:53,521
Why don't we take a little break?

1067
00:51:54,241 --> 00:51:55,918
Let me go and drink some water.

1068
00:51:57,841 --> 00:52:00,538
I should have studied for the college entrance exam like this.

1069
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:02,397
What could it be?

1070
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:04,991
Jun Ki, you're back.

1071
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:07,465
- Yes. - Wait.

1072
00:52:08,381 --> 00:52:09,693
Did you drink?

1073
00:52:09,881 --> 00:52:12,345
We wanted to celebrate with you. Why did you drink alone?

1074
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:14,103
I'm sorry,

1075
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,535
but I'm a little tired. I'll go to my room.

1076
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:22,612
What's with him?

1077
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:24,781
Did something happen?

1078
00:52:42,651 --> 00:52:45,276
("The Mean Game")

1079
00:52:46,151 --> 00:52:48,685
Isn't it tiring to be so righteous all the time?

1080
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,737
You piece of scum.

1081
00:52:51,191 --> 00:52:53,009
Pride won't feed you.

1082
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,722
And everyone else knows that.

1083
00:52:56,031 --> 00:52:57,900
No matter how hard you try to be righteous,

1084
00:52:57,901 --> 00:52:59,820
no one will ever recognize it.

1085
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:01,452
You know that, don't you?

1086
00:53:06,711 --> 00:53:09,135
(Father)

1087
00:53:14,281 --> 00:53:15,593
Hi, Dad.

1088
00:53:18,221 --> 00:53:21,593
Well, I'm doing this and that.

1089
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,778
I'm trying my best too.

1090
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,251
So stop bringing that up!

1091
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:33,649
("The Mean Game")

1092
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:35,857
I'm starting a new movie soon.

1093
00:53:36,801 --> 00:53:38,153
The director is Na Joon Ho.

1094
00:53:39,111 --> 00:53:40,121
Yes.

1095
00:53:41,511 --> 00:53:42,823
So don't worry about me.

1096
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:45,501
I'll call you again, Dad.

1097
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:47,221
Okay.

1098
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,616
("The Mean Game")

1099
00:53:55,221 --> 00:53:56,271
Okay.

1100
00:53:57,961 --> 00:53:59,506
Everyone else lives like this.

1101
00:54:01,031 --> 00:54:02,475
Why can't I?

1102
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:11,067
(Yu Ri's Kitchen 31)

1103
00:54:11,341 --> 00:54:12,421
Ki Bong.

1104
00:54:13,341 --> 00:54:14,725
What shall we do now?

1105
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:17,340
What do you mean?

1106
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:18,592
I mean,

1107
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:23,362
shouldn't we talk about our relationship from now on?

1108
00:54:24,051 --> 00:54:25,162
Oh, right.

1109
00:54:26,191 --> 00:54:27,231
We should.

1110
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,617
How about being honest with each other?

1111
00:54:32,361 --> 00:54:33,673
Do you...

1112
00:54:34,131 --> 00:54:35,241
like me?

1113
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:40,153
Well, I'm not sure.

1114
00:54:41,471 --> 00:54:45,449
I guess I feel concerned about you a little bit.

1115
00:54:48,011 --> 00:54:49,323
What about you?

1116
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:51,292
Me neither.

1117
00:54:52,151 --> 00:54:53,292
I'm not sure.

1118
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:55,796
To be honest,

1119
00:54:56,421 --> 00:54:58,369
I guess I feel concerned about you a little too.

1120
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,888
I guess we're kind of stuck in-between then.

1121
00:55:04,861 --> 00:55:06,002
I know.

1122
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:10,865
But if we just start dating thoughtlessly,

1123
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:15,478
I'm worried it might affect our friendship.

1124
00:55:15,671 --> 00:55:19,206
I know. I don't want our friendship to be affected either.

1125
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:22,506
And Woo Shik is also a problem.

1126
00:55:23,011 --> 00:55:26,142
That's true. Woo Shik will throw a fit if he finds out.

1127
00:55:27,721 --> 00:55:29,366
What should we do then?

1128
00:55:29,821 --> 00:55:30,961
I don't know.

1129
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,963
Then how about we go on just one date?

1130
00:55:38,361 --> 00:55:41,188
If we feel nothing for each other, we can just call it quits.

1131
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,642
What do you think?

1132
00:55:43,531 --> 00:55:44,829
That sounds good.

1133
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:47,598
Really? Then let's do that.

1134
00:55:52,611 --> 00:55:54,054
Are you hungry?

1135
00:55:54,370 --> 00:55:55,522
Do you want some spaghetti?

1136
00:55:56,111 --> 00:55:58,201
That sounds great. I'll help you.

1137
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:00,860
Okay.

1138
00:56:09,421 --> 00:56:11,279
What in the world is it?

1139
00:56:11,761 --> 00:56:14,499
We thought about this all night but we're still lost.

1140
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,611
Jung Eun.

1141
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:18,099
We should just give up now.

1142
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:20,292
I think we can solve it if we try a little more.

1143
00:56:21,971 --> 00:56:24,698
Woo Shik, L, I, W.

1144
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:29,735
Hold on. L.

1145
00:56:30,241 --> 00:56:32,130
Woo Shik, love?

1146
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:34,745
I'm right. It's really "love"!

1147
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:35,920
Right, Soo Yeon?

1148
00:56:35,921 --> 00:56:37,335
Oh, love?

1149
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,337
We never thought of that.

1150
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,026
Next is I, W, S, O, G.

1151
00:56:43,261 --> 00:56:45,452
This means... "I'll wait."

1152
00:56:46,261 --> 00:56:47,978
Woo Shik, love, I'll wait.

1153
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,300
I got it!

1154
00:56:49,301 --> 00:56:51,623
It means she'll wait for Woo Shik's love.

1155
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,688
Then what about S, O, and G?

1156
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:54,780
I'm not sure.

1157
00:56:55,071 --> 00:56:56,960
Woo Shik, love, I'll wait.

1158
00:56:57,401 --> 00:56:58,522
Soyang River?

1159
00:56:58,841 --> 00:57:00,740
Does it mean she'll wait at Soyang River?

1160
00:57:00,741 --> 00:57:03,709
What? Why would she wait at Soyang River?

1161
00:57:04,441 --> 00:57:05,522
No?

1162
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:07,364
Woo Shik, love, I'll wait.

1163
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,030
Sun Wukong?

1164
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,731
Insane killer?

1165
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:13,568
Where on earth is my phone?

1166
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,131
What is this mess?

1167
00:57:16,821 --> 00:57:17,829
What are you two doing?

1168
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:20,082
Well... We were just...

1169
00:57:21,801 --> 00:57:23,113
Why is my phone out here?

1170
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:24,371
The thing is,

1171
00:57:24,671 --> 00:57:27,269
we wanted to translate the text Min Ah sent you yesterday.

1172
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:30,027
What? Are you telling me you took my phone behind my back?

1173
00:57:30,241 --> 00:57:31,251
Sorry.

1174
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:34,038
Don't you guys have anything better to do?

1175
00:57:34,171 --> 00:57:36,363
Woo Shik, we're almost done solving it.

1176
00:57:37,511 --> 00:57:40,110
Look. "Woo Shik, love, I'll wait."

1177
00:57:40,111 --> 00:57:41,191
That's what it means.

1178
00:57:41,381 --> 00:57:43,050
- What? - It means,

1179
00:57:43,051 --> 00:57:45,789
Min Ah will wait for your love.

1180
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:47,710
What is this nonsense?

1181
00:57:47,821 --> 00:57:49,477
I told you, she's just a student.

1182
00:57:49,721 --> 00:57:50,801
Mr. Cha.

1183
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,630
What brings you here?

1184
00:57:53,631 --> 00:57:55,429
I was practicing singing at the studio,

1185
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,999
but my tone keeps getting unstable.

1186
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,949
- Okay. - Wait, Min Ah.

1187
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:00,841
What's wrong?

1188
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:03,699
That text you sent Woo Shik yesterday.

1189
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,387
What? What text?

1190
00:58:07,441 --> 00:58:10,106
This. The text you sent just by using alphabets.

1191
00:58:10,381 --> 00:58:12,979
Does this mean, "Woo Shik, love, I'll wait"?

1192
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:13,990
Am I right?

1193
00:58:14,151 --> 00:58:16,479
- What? - But the S, O, and G at the end.

1194
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,631
What do they mean?

1195
00:58:17,921 --> 00:58:19,820
I can't think of anything.

1196
00:58:19,821 --> 00:58:21,881
I didn't send this.

1197
00:58:23,361 --> 00:58:24,744
I guess Jae Min did that again.

1198
00:58:25,261 --> 00:58:26,745
Who is Jae Min?

1199
00:58:26,861 --> 00:58:29,199
My nephew. He just turned four.

1200
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,059
He takes my phone all the time...

1201
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:32,546
and just presses any button.

1202
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,960
Gosh, I guess he did it again.

1203
00:58:35,941 --> 00:58:37,240
I knew it.

1204
00:58:37,241 --> 00:58:38,756
I told you it didn't mean anything.

1205
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,139
What do you mean?

1206
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:41,840
She said that...

1207
00:58:41,841 --> 00:58:44,335
you liked me and wanted to ask me out with this text.

1208
00:58:44,711 --> 00:58:46,297
Does that make any sense at all?

1209
00:58:47,051 --> 00:58:48,940
It's not like it doesn't make sense.

1210
00:58:50,781 --> 00:58:51,932
Actually,

1211
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:54,169
I liked you before.

1212
00:58:55,091 --> 00:58:56,838
You were my first love.

1213
00:58:59,091 --> 00:59:00,241
What? First love?

1214
00:59:06,562 --> 00:59:08,147
This part looks good.

1215
00:59:08,971 --> 00:59:12,032
Sir, I studied the characters a bit.

1216
00:59:12,142 --> 00:59:14,999
Myeong Shik is suffering from social phobia.

1217
00:59:15,372 --> 00:59:17,211
So I thought we should make him stutter...

1218
00:59:17,212 --> 00:59:19,232
or have trouble looking into people's eyes.

1219
00:59:19,412 --> 00:59:21,027
I think we should emphasize some features like that.

1220
00:59:21,241 --> 00:59:22,323
What do you think?

1221
00:59:23,212 --> 00:59:25,403
I like it. It's a good idea.

1222
00:59:25,721 --> 00:59:28,391
Jun Ki, you must've studied the script really hard.

1223
00:59:28,392 --> 00:59:29,462
Thank you.

1224
00:59:29,692 --> 00:59:31,438
You haven't had lunch yet, right?

1225
00:59:31,562 --> 00:59:33,291
Why don't we talk over lunch?

1226
00:59:33,292 --> 00:59:34,372
That sounds good.

1227
00:59:38,462 --> 00:59:39,542
Sir.

1228
00:59:39,801 --> 00:59:41,448
Gosh, is it you again?

1229
00:59:46,301 --> 00:59:48,665
Sir, I just can't understand.

1230
00:59:49,442 --> 00:59:50,725
Please tell me why.

1231
00:59:51,142 --> 00:59:52,728
How could you do this to me suddenly?

1232
00:59:54,082 --> 00:59:57,311
Jun Ki, why don't you go to a nearby restaurant and wait?

1233
00:59:57,312 --> 00:59:58,650
I'll join you soon. Sorry.

1234
00:59:58,651 --> 00:59:59,864
Okay, sir.

1235
01:00:03,821 --> 01:00:06,790
That role was supposed to go to me.

1236
01:00:07,392 --> 01:00:09,090
I auditioned for that role.

1237
01:00:09,091 --> 01:00:11,082
But how could you suddenly cut me out?

1238
01:00:11,292 --> 01:00:12,860
How many times did I tell you?

1239
01:00:12,861 --> 01:00:15,800
We found someone who is more suitable for that role.

1240
01:00:15,801 --> 01:00:18,871
Sir, I've spent 10 years as a nameless actor.

1241
01:00:19,341 --> 01:00:21,019
I thought of this as my last opportunity...

1242
01:00:21,272 --> 01:00:22,928
and really devoted my life to it.

1243
01:00:23,212 --> 01:00:25,411
I can really do this, sir. I mean it.

1244
01:00:25,412 --> 01:00:27,705
I told you, it has already been decided.

1245
01:00:27,812 --> 01:00:29,428
Are you deaf or something?

1246
01:00:30,111 --> 01:00:31,121
Sir!

1247
01:00:31,381 --> 01:00:33,200
I'm begging you, sir.

1248
01:00:33,451 --> 01:00:36,090
Please. Just give me one more chance, sir.

1249
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:37,333
Please reconsider.

1250
01:00:37,921 --> 01:00:40,284
Sir, I'm begging you.

1251
01:00:40,591 --> 01:00:42,814
Please. I beg of you.

1252
01:00:43,432 --> 01:00:44,947
Please give me another chance, sir.

1253
01:00:45,901 --> 01:00:49,530
Sir, I'm begging you. Please.

1254
01:00:49,531 --> 01:00:51,641
I have no choice either.

1255
01:00:51,642 --> 01:00:54,101
We can't produce the movie if we don't use Hyun Sung.

1256
01:00:54,102 --> 01:00:56,061
Still, how could you do this?

1257
01:00:56,412 --> 01:00:58,681
I was supposed to play that role.

1258
01:00:58,682 --> 01:01:01,181
I auditioned for it and was chosen.

1259
01:01:01,182 --> 01:01:03,333
I told you, it has already been decided.

1260
01:01:03,752 --> 01:01:04,762
Please.

1261
01:01:05,821 --> 01:01:07,135
Please, sir.

1262
01:01:07,522 --> 01:01:10,117
I didn't even sleep or eat...

1263
01:01:10,421 --> 01:01:12,512
and practiced so hard for this role.

1264
01:01:13,261 --> 01:01:15,686
I'm really confident I can do this, sir.

1265
01:01:16,232 --> 01:01:18,484
Sir, please...

1266
01:01:21,031 --> 01:01:22,284
Please...

1267
01:01:26,772 --> 01:01:28,933
Please, I'm begging you, sir.

1268
01:01:29,611 --> 01:01:31,501
I'm begging you.

1269
01:01:31,741 --> 01:01:32,751
Please.

1270
01:01:33,582 --> 01:01:35,025
Please, sir.

1271
01:01:52,401 --> 01:01:56,441
("The Mean Game")

1272
01:01:58,102 --> 01:01:59,501
You must be happy, Woo Shik.

1273
01:01:59,502 --> 01:02:02,198
To be the first love of Min Ah, who is so pretty and adorable.

1274
01:02:02,341 --> 01:02:03,423
Stop it.

1275
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:05,541
Why are you overreacting when it's not a big deal?

1276
01:02:05,542 --> 01:02:06,753
Why isn't it a big deal?

1277
01:02:07,281 --> 01:02:08,950
Hey, what if...

1278
01:02:08,951 --> 01:02:11,251
Min Ah still likes you?

1279
01:02:11,252 --> 01:02:12,262
What?

1280
01:02:12,721 --> 01:02:14,891
She said it was a long time ago.

1281
01:02:14,892 --> 01:02:16,891
Still, why would she say that in front of you?

1282
01:02:16,892 --> 01:02:17,931
It's strange.

1283
01:02:18,122 --> 01:02:19,272
Don't you think, Soo Yeon?

1284
01:02:19,292 --> 01:02:20,331
What?

1285
01:02:21,662 --> 01:02:23,610
- I'm not sure. - Hey, Kim Jung Eun!

1286
01:02:23,991 --> 01:02:26,152
Stop it, or I'm really going to get mad.

1287
01:02:26,301 --> 01:02:28,756
Fine. You don't have to get all mad.

1288
01:02:30,272 --> 01:02:32,220
Jun Ki, how did it go?

1289
01:02:32,502 --> 01:02:33,653
Did the meeting end well?

1290
01:02:36,741 --> 01:02:38,296
What's with the look on your face?

1291
01:02:38,841 --> 01:02:40,195
Did something go wrong?

1292
01:02:41,812 --> 01:02:43,023
I quit.

1293
01:02:43,712 --> 01:02:45,601
What do you mean? What did you quit?

1294
01:02:45,682 --> 01:02:46,893
I quit acting.

1295
01:02:48,252 --> 01:02:49,463
I'm not ever going to act again.

1296
01:02:50,752 --> 01:02:53,489
Hey, what are you talking about? Jun Ki!

1297
01:02:59,932 --> 01:03:02,023
Jun Ki! What's going on?

1298
01:03:02,201 --> 01:03:04,293
What do you mean you quit acting? What are you talking about?

1299
01:03:05,102 --> 01:03:06,212
Open up, okay?

1300
01:03:06,502 --> 01:03:08,330
Come on and open the door.

1301
01:04:09,531 --> 01:04:12,228
(Welcome to Waikiki 2 / Eulachacha Waikiki 2)

1302
01:04:12,651 --> 01:04:14,821
What do you think happened to him?

1303
01:04:14,822 --> 01:04:16,361
What does he mean by "quit acting"?

1304
01:04:16,362 --> 01:04:17,391
Maybe he's depressed?

1305
01:04:17,392 --> 01:04:20,161
I'm going to find out what happened and make him come to his senses.

1306
01:04:20,162 --> 01:04:21,931
I already told you, I don't want to talk about it.

1307
01:04:21,932 --> 01:04:24,330
I'll tell you all my secrets and you tell me yours.

1308
01:04:24,331 --> 01:04:25,745
I used to like you.

1309
01:04:26,001 --> 01:04:28,170
We're going out on a date today, right?

1310
01:04:28,171 --> 01:04:30,400
If it doesn't seem right, we'll just go back to our usual relationship.

1311
01:04:30,401 --> 01:04:32,229
I never even imagined going on a date with you.

1312
01:04:32,342 --> 01:04:34,571
I don't think we're meant to be.

1313
01:04:34,572 --> 01:04:36,732
I didn't think we would be this impossible.

1314
01:04:36,782 --> 01:04:38,810
- Hello. - Don't you think...

1315
01:04:38,811 --> 01:04:40,980
Min Ah still likes Woo Shik?

1316
01:04:40,981 --> 01:04:42,750
Well, I'm not really sure...

1317
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,135
Does it bother you?
