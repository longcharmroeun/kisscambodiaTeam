(All characters, organizations, places, and events are fictional.)

2
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:38,633
Wow, you look so relaxed,

3
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:42,072
sitting out here drawing.

4
00:00:52,117 --> 00:00:54,553
Did you enjoy getting me expelled?

5
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:57,453
Why did you do it? Why?

6
00:00:57,498 --> 00:00:59,696
Why did you even get involved?

7
00:00:59,697 --> 00:01:02,222
- Because I'm a witness. - What?

8
00:01:02,327 --> 00:01:04,633
I only described what I saw.

9
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:08,732
You're a real psycho.

10
00:01:09,268 --> 00:01:11,732
You're out of your mind, aren't you?

11
00:01:14,477 --> 00:01:15,702
Han Dong Rim.

12
00:01:16,048 --> 00:01:18,673
You seem to think you're something.

13
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:20,883
Don't, because you're not.

14
00:01:21,747 --> 00:01:23,443
I'll kill you.

15
00:01:23,788 --> 00:01:24,913
Sure.

16
00:01:26,158 --> 00:01:28,023
Kill me if you can.

17
00:01:28,658 --> 00:01:30,053
Kill me.

18
00:01:46,777 --> 00:01:47,943
Let's go.

19
00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:31,113
Kid!

20
00:02:38,328 --> 00:02:39,592
Kid?

21
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,237
If you hear this, come to Muji High School.

22
00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:51,872
We have a shelter.

23
00:02:51,907 --> 00:02:53,977
If you hear this, come to Muji High School.

24
00:02:53,978 --> 00:02:55,402
We have a shelter.

25
00:02:56,847 --> 00:03:00,212
(Dark Hole)

26
00:03:01,217 --> 00:03:03,387
If you hear this, come to Muji High School.

27
00:03:03,388 --> 00:03:04,983
We have a shelter.

28
00:03:05,117 --> 00:03:07,427
If you hear this, come to Muji High School.

29
00:03:07,428 --> 00:03:09,222
We have a shelter.

30
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:10,993
Anyone can come.

31
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:13,126
If you hear this, come to Muji High School.

32
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:14,692
We have a shelter.

33
00:03:15,527 --> 00:03:17,996
If you're a survivor, come to Muji High School.

34
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,432
We have a shelter.

35
00:03:19,738 --> 00:03:21,536
If you hear this, come to Muji High School.

36
00:03:21,537 --> 00:03:22,962
We have a shelter.

37
00:03:23,668 --> 00:03:25,836
If you hear this, come to Muji High School.

38
00:03:25,837 --> 00:03:27,472
We have a shelter.

39
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:30,047
If you hear this, come to Muji High School.

40
00:03:30,048 --> 00:03:31,743
We have a shelter.

41
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:33,417
Anyone can come.

42
00:03:33,418 --> 00:03:35,888
- Come on! Hurry! - Come to Muji High School.

43
00:03:35,888 --> 00:03:37,113
We have a shelter.

44
00:04:26,898 --> 00:04:28,437
- Are you okay? - Are you okay?

45
00:04:28,438 --> 00:04:30,632
Dad, I think I sprained my ankle.

46
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,676
I'll take her.

47
00:04:32,677 --> 00:04:35,247
- Get going without us. Go on. - Dad.

48
00:04:35,248 --> 00:04:36,642
Hurry up and go!

49
00:05:03,008 --> 00:05:05,832
Keep going! Go!

50
00:05:06,107 --> 00:05:07,432
Run!

51
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:11,543
Go!

52
00:05:26,698 --> 00:05:31,062
Is he trying to get everyone in here killed?

53
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,872
- Sir. - Let go of me.

54
00:05:38,078 --> 00:05:39,406
We need to save people who are outside.

55
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:42,546
There are monsters out there. We can't open the door.

56
00:05:42,547 --> 00:05:43,973
Sir, listen.

57
00:05:44,148 --> 00:05:46,216
There are people out there including our students.

58
00:05:46,217 --> 00:05:49,983
Director Choi doesn't want anyone to open the door.

59
00:05:50,547 --> 00:05:51,653
What?

60
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:54,586
- Mr. Choi. - Hyun Mi.

61
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:57,627
Hyun Mi! Hyun Mi!

62
00:05:57,628 --> 00:06:00,392
Hyun Mi... Hyun Mi!

63
00:06:01,097 --> 00:06:02,192
Hyun Mi!

64
00:06:02,268 --> 00:06:05,593
Hyun Mi! Hyun Mi! Hyun...

65
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,973
Did you see that?

66
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,743
Are you going to keep listening to the director?

67
00:06:23,318 --> 00:06:27,182
Would you have done the same if that kid was your daughter?

68
00:07:27,618 --> 00:07:28,713
Kid.

69
00:07:31,558 --> 00:07:32,653
Kid.

70
00:07:36,328 --> 00:07:37,423
Where are you?

71
00:07:56,248 --> 00:07:58,642
Do they not harm animals?

72
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,202
Come inside. Hurry.

73
00:08:35,518 --> 00:08:36,642
Are you okay?

74
00:08:38,557 --> 00:08:39,853
Thank you.

75
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,857
By any chance, did a kid happen to come in here?

76
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,093
It's a girl.

77
00:08:46,758 --> 00:08:48,823
Are you looking for Do Yoon?

78
00:08:49,368 --> 00:08:50,693
Do you know her?

79
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:53,093
Detective.

80
00:09:06,478 --> 00:09:08,443
Detective, are you okay?

81
00:09:08,817 --> 00:09:11,412
If you're hurt, let me take a look.

82
00:09:14,557 --> 00:09:15,853
It's okay.

83
00:09:16,258 --> 00:09:18,453
I just bumped into an injured person.

84
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:22,363
But why did you take the kid?

85
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:26,032
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

86
00:09:26,598 --> 00:09:30,563
I only brought her here because she was all alone.

87
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:34,973
Do you know her?

88
00:09:35,447 --> 00:09:39,813
Yes, I work as a nurse at the same hospital as her mother.

89
00:09:40,718 --> 00:09:44,983
Did you say you're a detective?

90
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:49,422
I'm a detective from the regional investigation unit in Seoul.

91
00:09:51,797 --> 00:09:54,152
What brings you all the way here from Seoul?

92
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:56,463
I came looking for someone.

93
00:09:58,238 --> 00:10:01,162
Are you here to catch a criminal?

94
00:10:03,807 --> 00:10:07,473
But where's Do Yoon's mother?

95
00:10:14,618 --> 00:10:15,782
She's dead.

96
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,483
Do Yoon.

97
00:10:24,187 --> 00:10:25,392
It's okay.

98
00:10:26,157 --> 00:10:29,093
You can stay here with me from now on.

99
00:10:33,338 --> 00:10:38,507
Sister, why don't you give Do Yoon something to drink?

100
00:10:38,508 --> 00:10:39,703
Okay, sure.

101
00:10:40,077 --> 00:10:42,103
We have hot chocolate. Would you like some?

102
00:10:45,947 --> 00:10:47,743
You don't need to ask me for permission.

103
00:10:49,118 --> 00:10:50,213
Okay.

104
00:10:56,358 --> 00:10:58,052
Is it because you're a detective?

105
00:10:59,297 --> 00:11:02,162
How could you say her mother died right in front of the kid?

106
00:11:04,228 --> 00:11:06,762
She needs to be strong from now on.

107
00:11:23,988 --> 00:11:25,282
What is this place?

108
00:11:28,858 --> 00:11:30,152
Don't be afraid.

109
00:11:30,927 --> 00:11:33,853
We are here with the New Savior.

110
00:12:02,358 --> 00:12:03,782
Are you all right?

111
00:12:06,457 --> 00:12:07,552
Yes.

112
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,493
What is it?

113
00:12:09,768 --> 00:12:13,367
This belongs to one of our believers.

114
00:12:13,368 --> 00:12:14,608
I thought you might want to change...

115
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,203
since your clothes are stained with blood.

116
00:12:18,277 --> 00:12:19,603
Thank you.

117
00:12:20,108 --> 00:12:21,943
Are you really okay?

118
00:12:23,407 --> 00:12:24,502
What?

119
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,042
You don't seem so well.

120
00:12:27,577 --> 00:12:29,743
Would you like to drink the water of life?

121
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:36,083
This will help you calm your anxiety.

122
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,152
No, it's okay.

123
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:45,162
Let me tell you this.

124
00:12:45,968 --> 00:12:48,502
You and Do Yoon are here...

125
00:12:48,838 --> 00:12:50,762
because that's what the New Savior wanted.

126
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,603
Right now, the New Savior...

127
00:12:54,138 --> 00:12:57,142
is punishing those who have no faith.

128
00:12:58,478 --> 00:12:59,912
What do you mean?

129
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:02,512
The New Savior led you here.

130
00:13:02,718 --> 00:13:04,282
So you should believe in the New Savior.

131
00:13:07,858 --> 00:13:09,853
Do you really mean that?

132
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:14,392
I can see you're very suspicious.

133
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,097
You must let go of your suspicions if you want to go to paradise...

134
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:19,333
Listen.

135
00:13:20,138 --> 00:13:22,603
You're free to believe in whatever you want to believe.

136
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:25,402
But you'd better stay alert.

137
00:13:26,008 --> 00:13:28,103
That's the only way you can stay alive.

138
00:13:31,648 --> 00:13:32,843
What about Do Yoon?

139
00:13:34,518 --> 00:13:37,683
You're free to choose your own path.

140
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:41,012
But you don't have the right to choose what's good for her.

141
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,723
Do Yoon...

142
00:13:44,327 --> 00:13:47,052
is safer here with me.

143
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,223
You think about that.

144
00:14:49,228 --> 00:14:52,453
Help. Please help.

145
00:14:53,657 --> 00:14:56,422
Help. Let me in.

146
00:14:57,427 --> 00:14:58,563
Please.

147
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,032
Please take me to the hospital.

148
00:15:17,687 --> 00:15:21,012
Please hurry up and take me to the hospital.

149
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:33,233
(Taehan Towing)

150
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,132
My gosh. Good work.

151
00:16:16,707 --> 00:16:21,587
Doctor, this will be enough to keep out the black smoke, right?

152
00:16:21,588 --> 00:16:25,782
Yes. Those are three-panel doors. No smoke will get through them.

153
00:16:26,488 --> 00:16:28,286
But I'm not sure about the mutants.

154
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,858
Officer Cho and I will keep you safe.

155
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:31,993
Don't worry.

156
00:16:32,498 --> 00:16:34,926
Everyone, you can relax.

157
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,166
The rescue time will be here any moment.

158
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:38,637
- Yes! - Yes!

159
00:16:38,638 --> 00:16:42,737
- Hooray for Officer Park! - You're the best!

160
00:16:42,738 --> 00:16:44,137
Hooray for Officer Park!

161
00:16:44,138 --> 00:16:47,576
- Hooray for Officer Park! - Officer Park, you did a great job.

162
00:16:47,577 --> 00:16:49,046
Have some coffee.

163
00:16:49,047 --> 00:16:50,473
I appreciate it.

164
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:54,073
Officer, you really are incredible.

165
00:16:55,187 --> 00:16:57,816
You're risking your life and taking the initiative...

166
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,613
for the citizens.

167
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:01,552
Everyone.

168
00:17:02,758 --> 00:17:04,422
We all...

169
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,653
should trust Park Soon Il and relax.

170
00:17:07,957 --> 00:17:10,163
- Of course. - We trust him.

171
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:12,493
Thank you so much.

172
00:17:15,237 --> 00:17:16,963
I feel so safe now.

173
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:19,933
Goodness, he really did a good job.

174

The person you have reached is not available...

175
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:33,612
Still not working?

176
00:17:33,818 --> 00:17:34,923
No.

177
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:38,183
It's going to be restored soon. Don't worry too much.

179
00:19:32,078 --> 00:19:33,332
What happened?

180

(Police)

181
00:19:56,568 --> 00:19:59,436
Hello? Open the door!

182
00:19:59,437 --> 00:20:02,337
Hello? Please open the door!

183
00:20:02,338 --> 00:20:03,532
Hello?

184
00:20:08,138 --> 00:20:10,673
Soon Il, it's me. It's Tae Han.

185
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:12,246
Open the door!

186
00:20:12,247 --> 00:20:14,216
There's an emergency patient.

187
00:20:14,217 --> 00:20:15,847
Open up!

188
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:18,287
It's urgent! What are you doing?

189
00:20:18,288 --> 00:20:19,857
This is getting interesting.

190
00:20:19,858 --> 00:20:21,287
Hey, Doctor!

191
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:23,627
There's an emergency patient. Please open the door.

192
00:20:23,628 --> 00:20:26,693
Officer Park, we should open the door right now.

193
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:28,822
- Okay. - Hold on.

194
00:20:29,467 --> 00:20:31,696
Our priority is to keep the people in here safe.

195
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,436
If that man is infected, he'll put everyone in danger.

196
00:20:34,437 --> 00:20:36,832
Open the door right now!

197
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:49,216
Open up! Now!

00:20:49,217 --> 00:20:51,342
(Muji Hospital)

199
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,087
Are you out of your mind?

200
00:20:57,088 --> 00:20:59,496
- I'll break the door! - Officer Park!

201
00:20:59,497 --> 00:21:01,897
We can't let the smoke in. Open the door right now.

202
00:21:01,898 --> 00:21:04,663
So? Should I break it?

203
00:21:08,338 --> 00:21:09,463
Okay.

204
00:21:19,118 --> 00:21:21,713
- Take him to the emergency room. - Okay.

205
00:21:26,657 --> 00:21:28,822
You almost killed me.

206
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:31,557
You crazy idiot. You almost killed all of us.

207
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:32,726
Calm down.

208
00:21:32,727 --> 00:21:35,562
It wasn't easy for us to open the door in this situation.

209
00:21:39,437 --> 00:21:40,933
I'm sorry.

210
00:21:43,538 --> 00:21:45,877
Follow me. You seem to need treatment.

211
00:21:45,878 --> 00:21:48,473
Doctor, what do you think you're doing?

212
00:21:49,477 --> 00:21:51,706
If he's been bitten by a mutant,

213
00:21:51,707 --> 00:21:53,243
he must be infected too.

214
00:21:57,118 --> 00:21:59,057
Not everyone who gets bitten gets infected.

215
00:21:59,058 --> 00:22:00,653
I'll take full responsibility.

216
00:22:00,757 --> 00:22:02,022
Come with me.

217
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:28,237
Do you remember me?

218
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:31,111
Yesterday, you told me...

219
00:22:31,112 --> 00:22:33,516
to keep the smoke out of the hospital.

220
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:36,887
That's right.

221
00:22:36,991 --> 00:22:39,720
We could protect our patients and their families...

222
00:22:39,721 --> 00:22:41,616
thanks to you.

223
00:22:42,032 --> 00:22:43,356
Thank you.

224
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:45,356
Rest up now.

225
00:22:45,501 --> 00:22:46,957
Your arm...

226
00:22:48,532 --> 00:22:49,826
I'm sorry.

227
00:22:53,642 --> 00:22:54,737
Sure.

228
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:19,997
You're free to choose your own path.

229
00:23:20,431 --> 00:23:23,366
But you don't have the right to choose what's good for her.

230
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:25,197
Do Yoon...

231
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:28,296
is safer here with me.

232
00:23:29,612 --> 00:23:31,036
You think about that.

233
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:35,677
Detective?

234
00:23:36,411 --> 00:23:37,707
Detective, do you hear me?

235
00:23:42,852 --> 00:23:44,116
Yes, I hear you.

236
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:46,957
Good. You're safe.

237
00:23:48,092 --> 00:23:50,326
Yes. You too.

238
00:23:50,832 --> 00:23:54,356
So... The kid. Did you save her?

239
00:24:03,741 --> 00:24:05,407
I saved the kid,

240
00:24:06,181 --> 00:24:08,407
but not the nurse.

241
00:24:09,052 --> 00:24:10,147
I too...

242
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,377
couldn't save my friend.

243
00:24:14,552 --> 00:24:16,016
Don't blame yourself.

244
00:24:16,652 --> 00:24:18,247
It's not your fault.

245
00:24:19,322 --> 00:24:20,417
Where are you?

246
00:24:21,191 --> 00:24:23,791
I briefly took shelter somewhere safe.

247
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:25,230
Where are you?

248
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:28,460
I'm at Muji Hospital.

249
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:30,326
Are there any survivors there?

250
00:24:30,931 --> 00:24:32,667
Yes, fortunately.

251
00:24:33,441 --> 00:24:34,637
I see.

252
00:24:35,342 --> 00:24:37,440
I think I should head to the school.

253
00:24:37,441 --> 00:24:39,177
They have a shelter.

254
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:42,076
I'll contact you again.

255
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:48,447
Be careful.

256
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:55,756
I'll give you an antibiotic and tetanus shot.

257
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:58,157
Thanks.

- Yoon Saet Byeol. - Is she from here?

260
00:25:10,812 --> 00:25:12,041
- She's from Seoul. - How old is she?

261
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:13,237
She's 22.

262
00:25:14,411 --> 00:25:15,506
What does she do?

263
00:25:16,312 --> 00:25:18,151
Are you interrogating me?

264
00:25:18,152 --> 00:25:21,180
- I bet she's weird. - She's not.

265
00:25:21,181 --> 00:25:24,447
She's an angel. A total angel.

266
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,616
Do you...

267
00:25:29,062 --> 00:25:32,056
happen to know a Nam Young Sik?

268
00:25:32,402 --> 00:25:35,697
Wait. Do you know Young Sik too?

269
00:25:38,171 --> 00:25:40,536
Yes. We're friends.

270
00:25:43,011 --> 00:25:46,207
He didn't tell you something weird, did he?

271
00:25:47,981 --> 00:25:49,147
Not really.

272
00:25:50,612 --> 00:25:51,947
He said you're nice.

273
00:25:55,082 --> 00:25:57,346
He'll be safe too, won't he?

274
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:11,697
Well,

275
00:26:12,802 --> 00:26:14,637
he does have lots of talents.

276
00:26:16,971 --> 00:26:18,306
He does.

277
00:26:18,372 --> 00:26:20,776
I bet he's hiding somewhere safe.

278
00:26:21,211 --> 00:26:23,877
He's quick-witted, very unlike his looks.

279
00:26:28,082 --> 00:26:29,247
Were you...

280
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,987
on the radio with a detective?

281
00:26:36,632 --> 00:26:37,727
Yes.

282
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:41,026
Then will we all be rescued?

283
00:26:44,632 --> 00:26:45,737
I don't know.

284
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:49,036
I see.

285
00:26:50,911 --> 00:26:53,377
I hope things go back to normal.

286
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:40,717

00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:51,326
- Come over here. - Oh, dear.

290
00:27:54,872 --> 00:27:55,967
Salute.

Rookie. Repeat after me. Sparrows go...

292
00:28:05,721 --> 00:28:06,816
Sparrows go...

293
00:28:07,622 --> 00:28:08,816
- Sparrows... - Yoo Tae Han.

294
00:28:08,892 --> 00:28:10,717
All I have to say to you is,

295
00:28:11,751 --> 00:28:13,387
do not become like him.

296
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,286
- Do you understand? - Yes, sir.

297
00:28:17,532 --> 00:28:19,531
You're so out of it. Stand up straight.

298
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:21,500
Why is this place so...

299
00:28:21,501 --> 00:28:23,670
- out of order? - What are you doing?

300
00:28:23,671 --> 00:28:25,326
How's this?

301
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:28,000
Go on your way. We're wrestling.

302
00:28:28,001 --> 00:28:30,336
How dare you? Stand down.

303
00:28:33,582 --> 00:28:35,407
I saw you.

304
00:28:40,451 --> 00:28:41,546
Pardon?

305
00:28:41,852 --> 00:28:43,316
Where's the woman?

306
00:28:44,352 --> 00:28:45,447
The woman?

307
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:48,887
That woman inhaled black smoke too.

308
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,796
Don't be too anxious.

309
00:28:59,842 --> 00:29:01,566
You'll find out soon.

310
00:29:23,191 --> 00:29:26,356
Mr. Kim, we can't use the broadcasting booth now, can we?

311
00:29:28,161 --> 00:29:30,897
No. Director Choi smashed it up.

312
00:29:31,701 --> 00:29:34,596
Isn't that where the emergency communication equipment is?

313
00:29:34,971 --> 00:29:36,167
It is.

314
00:29:36,471 --> 00:29:38,137
It's for the best.

315
00:29:38,271 --> 00:29:40,010
If people hear the broadcast and keep coming here,

316
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:41,581
we'll run out of food.

317
00:29:41,582 --> 00:29:44,106
The few who are here need to survive, right?

318
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:47,177
- I'll get more tape. - Okay.

319
00:29:50,092 --> 00:29:54,256
Stack it up so there are no spaces for mutants to squeeze through!

320
00:29:54,991 --> 00:29:56,427
Get to it!

321
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:00,596
What are you doing? Move faster.

322
00:30:01,632 --> 00:30:02,727
My gosh.

323
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:08,500
Are you stupid? You can't even do this?

324
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:10,710
Is your finger tasty? Give me that.

325
00:30:10,711 --> 00:30:12,111
Can't you even hammer a nail?

326
00:30:12,112 --> 00:30:14,381
- You moron. - It really hurt.

327
00:30:14,382 --> 00:30:15,440
You moron.

328
00:30:15,441 --> 00:30:16,882
- Watch it. - What?

329
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:18,106
Darn you.

330
00:30:20,181 --> 00:30:22,217
Are you here to fool around?

331
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:25,147
No, sir.

332
00:30:26,921 --> 00:30:29,460
They're still young.

333
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:30,960
They're not good with nails.

334
00:30:30,961 --> 00:30:32,157
Look.

335
00:30:32,562 --> 00:30:35,766
Do you think the mutants differentiate men, women, and kids?

336
00:30:39,701 --> 00:30:41,366
Hello, Director Choi.

337
00:30:43,612 --> 00:30:44,806
Do your job right.

338
00:30:45,572 --> 00:30:48,707
One person's mistake can get us all killed.

339
00:30:49,411 --> 00:30:50,506
Do you understand?

340
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:55,546
Mr. Seo. It's your responsibility.

341
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,051
Report to me when everything's done.

342
00:30:58,052 --> 00:30:59,457
I understand, sir.

343
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:04,286
How are we to overcome a crisis with this slack mindset?

344
00:31:15,872 --> 00:31:19,141
Kids these days don't think.

345
00:31:19,142 --> 00:31:21,536
All they know to do is waste taxes.

346
00:31:24,312 --> 00:31:26,220
Did you check the gas masks?

347
00:31:26,221 --> 00:31:29,250
Yes. We'd bought some last year for the crisis management course.

348
00:31:29,251 --> 00:31:31,151
Is the emergency generator fueled?

349
00:31:31,152 --> 00:31:34,121
If we use it sparingly, it'll last us a month.

350
00:31:34,122 --> 00:31:35,356
And rations?

351
00:31:37,132 --> 00:31:39,500
I checked the food we have in the cafeteria.

352
00:31:39,501 --> 00:31:41,727
We have enough for a week.

353
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:44,770
One week?

354
00:31:44,771 --> 00:31:48,141
Yes. For the students, staff, and local residents.

355
00:31:48,142 --> 00:31:50,710
- Starting today, we eat once a day. - Once a day?

356
00:31:50,711 --> 00:31:53,006
Are you here on a picnic?

357
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:55,950
This is an emergency.

358
00:31:55,951 --> 00:31:57,851
We don't know how long this will go on for.

359
00:31:57,852 --> 00:32:00,081
Should we feed everyone three meals a day?

360
00:32:00,082 --> 00:32:01,677
Do you want us all to die?

361
00:32:02,181 --> 00:32:05,447
I apologize. I didn't think that far, sir.

362
00:32:05,961 --> 00:32:08,591
Do you remember what we must do...

363
00:32:08,592 --> 00:32:10,657
in case of an emergency?

364
00:32:10,892 --> 00:32:12,356
Yes, sir.

365
00:32:15,971 --> 00:32:17,066
Bye, then.

366
00:32:45,532 --> 00:32:47,796
(The New Savior is waiting for you.)

367
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:53,096
Detective, you must be hungry.

368
00:32:53,441 --> 00:32:55,036
Let's eat.

369
00:33:16,532 --> 00:33:19,656
Do Yoon, you can come eat with me.

370
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,207
(Evangelize for the New Paradise)

371
00:33:38,581 --> 00:33:42,817
Let's all say grace.

372
00:33:49,391 --> 00:33:53,730
We sincerely thank the New Savior for providing us food...

373
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:55,527
during these times of hardships.

374
00:33:55,762 --> 00:34:00,071
We believe you will save us and take us to the new paradise.

375
00:34:00,072 --> 00:34:02,136
- We believe. - We believe.

376
00:34:02,242 --> 00:34:05,841
Let our faith enable you to achieve all your plans.

377
00:34:05,842 --> 00:34:07,911
- We believe! - We believe!

378
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:10,946
- We believe! - We believe!

379
00:34:11,081 --> 00:34:13,917
- Our savior will achieve his plans! - We believe.

380
00:34:16,492 --> 00:34:18,446
Let us eat now.

381
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:36,167
What's wrong?

382
00:34:36,912 --> 00:34:39,167
Do you not like instant food?

383
00:34:39,782 --> 00:34:41,076
No, it's not that.

384
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,277
I think it's time for me to leave.

385
00:34:45,152 --> 00:34:46,547
Let's go, Do Yoon.

386
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,116
She should eat first.

387
00:34:49,891 --> 00:34:51,147
Don't you agree?

388
00:34:53,162 --> 00:34:55,486
Eat up. Here.

389
00:35:12,682 --> 00:35:14,007
- My goodness. - Oh, gosh.

390
00:35:14,182 --> 00:35:15,636
Do Yoon.

391
00:35:15,742 --> 00:35:17,681
- My goodness. - What's wrong?

392
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:20,247
My goodness, Do Yoon. What's wrong?

393
00:35:20,521 --> 00:35:23,087
- Do Yoon. - Is she okay?

394
00:35:23,592 --> 00:35:26,261
Do Yoon, what's wrong?

395
00:35:26,262 --> 00:35:27,587
Oh, dear.

396
00:35:29,932 --> 00:35:32,727
Do Yoon. Do Yoon, hang in there.

397
00:35:32,762 --> 00:35:34,527
- Help me lay her down. - Okay.

398
00:35:35,862 --> 00:35:38,797
Just a second. Do Yoon, open your eyes.

399
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:41,837
Do you see me?

400
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:43,837
Wait.

401
00:35:45,512 --> 00:35:47,007
Is this where it hurts?

402
00:35:54,322 --> 00:35:56,020
We need to increase her body temperature, so bring me a blanket.

403
00:35:56,021 --> 00:35:57,647
- Okay. - Do Yoon.

404
00:35:57,891 --> 00:36:00,886
Do Yoon, look at me. Do Yoon, can you hear me?

405
00:36:13,242 --> 00:36:14,897
She'll be okay soon.

406
00:36:16,412 --> 00:36:18,167
What happened to her?

407
00:36:18,771 --> 00:36:22,036
Do Yoon has anaphylaxis.

408
00:36:22,682 --> 00:36:24,176
How do you treat that?

409
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:26,877
She needs an epinephrine injection.

410
00:36:27,621 --> 00:36:28,716
What?

411
00:36:29,691 --> 00:36:31,946
She needs an adrenaline shot.

412
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:34,516
Don't worry.

413
00:36:34,691 --> 00:36:38,527
The New Savior will protect Do Yoon.

414
00:36:42,032 --> 00:36:44,326
You will recover soon.

415
00:36:44,472 --> 00:36:46,136
- We believe. - We believe.

416
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:50,072
Do Yoon, why don't you drink the water of life...

417
00:36:50,072 --> 00:36:51,736
so that you will recover soon?

418
00:36:52,342 --> 00:36:53,477
Let's go.

419
00:37:04,851 --> 00:37:06,786
I know what you're thinking.

420
00:37:07,461 --> 00:37:09,857
But that will only put Do Yoon in danger.

421
00:37:10,231 --> 00:37:13,997
She's a lot safer here with us.

422
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:16,497
Do you really think...

423
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:20,437
you can protect her until this is all over?

424
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,257
Are you going somewhere?

425
00:37:42,521 --> 00:37:44,426
How's the kid?

426
00:37:45,061 --> 00:37:46,661
She's okay now.

427
00:37:46,662 --> 00:37:48,361
Ms. Kim...

428
00:37:48,362 --> 00:37:51,227
is taking good care of her, so don't worry.

429
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,536
I haven't seen you eat anything.

430
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:58,266
You should at least drink some water.

431
00:38:03,251 --> 00:38:07,247
You might think we're bizarre. I understand that.

432
00:38:07,722 --> 00:38:10,250
But we're not bad people...

433
00:38:10,251 --> 00:38:12,247
like criminals.

434
00:38:12,652 --> 00:38:15,116
Please don't get the wrong idea about us.

435
00:38:31,271 --> 00:38:34,007
I heard an announcement before coming here.

436
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:36,076
Are you talking about the school?

437
00:38:37,311 --> 00:38:39,306
Once the kid gets better,

438
00:38:39,782 --> 00:38:41,676
we'll be going there.

439
00:38:42,452 --> 00:38:45,147
Detective, do you seriously believe the announcement?

440
00:38:46,362 --> 00:38:50,727
Schools turn into shelters in disasters like this happen.

441
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:52,627
How foolish of you.

442
00:38:53,362 --> 00:38:54,897
Going there...

443
00:38:55,202 --> 00:38:58,326
won't help you get rid of your fears.

444
00:38:58,831 --> 00:39:00,036
No.

445
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:04,111
You're the ones who are trembling in fear.

446
00:39:04,112 --> 00:39:07,777
You just blindly depend on that savior of yours.

447
00:39:11,552 --> 00:39:14,250
Okay, fine. You lack faith.

448
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:15,946
So you're free to leave.

449
00:39:15,952 --> 00:39:19,386
But you can't take Do Yoon.

450
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,620
She'll be staying with us...

451
00:39:22,621 --> 00:39:25,257
so she can get on the boat to the new paradise.

452
00:39:25,662 --> 00:39:29,027
That is what's best for Do Yoon.

453
00:39:45,581 --> 00:39:47,016
Don't worry.

454
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:49,986
Ms. Kim just mixed...

455
00:39:49,992 --> 00:39:52,946
a small dose of tranquilizer into your water.

456
00:40:23,652 --> 00:40:25,486
Hello.

457
00:40:25,822 --> 00:40:30,527
I'm sorry about this afternoon.

458
00:40:31,391 --> 00:40:35,156
No, it's okay. You were right.

459
00:40:35,432 --> 00:40:39,326
I know the girl who died wasn't my daughter or anything.

460
00:40:39,941 --> 00:40:42,170
But I just didn't want to get scolded by the director...

461
00:40:42,171 --> 00:40:43,806
and ended up making the wrong choice.

462
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:48,281
Does that mean you forgive me for what happened earlier?

463
00:40:48,282 --> 00:40:51,076
Gosh, there's nothing to forgive.

464
00:40:51,211 --> 00:40:53,451
You're the one who's going through the most.

465
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:55,781
No, that's not true. You have a lot more to do.

466
00:40:55,782 --> 00:40:57,786
No, that's nonsense.

467
00:40:58,421 --> 00:41:00,486
- Anyway, thank you. - Don't mention it.

468
00:41:25,311 --> 00:41:28,016
It's even scary to pee in the bathroom now.

469
00:41:28,921 --> 00:41:31,716
But we're lucky because we won't have to take the CSATs.

470
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:35,286
What does the CSATs have anything to do with you? My gosh.

471
00:41:35,621 --> 00:41:37,857
- Are you nuts? - What?

472
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:40,431
If I put my mind to it and study hard,

473
00:41:40,432 --> 00:41:41,957
I can easily go to a four-year university.

474
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:44,227
Hey.

475
00:41:45,271 --> 00:41:47,196
I still can't access the Internet.

476
00:41:48,501 --> 00:41:51,466
Are you sure Korea is an IT powerhouse?

477
00:41:51,612 --> 00:41:55,277
What if it's not just us? What if the entire country's destroyed?

478
00:41:55,811 --> 00:41:59,007
Why would you even say something so absurd?

479
00:41:59,081 --> 00:42:01,777
- Just go to sleep. - My gosh.

480
00:42:02,882 --> 00:42:04,087
What are you doing?

481
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:07,556
Hey, why don't you guys just be quiet?

482
00:42:57,972 --> 00:42:59,937
Say a word about...

483
00:43:00,541 --> 00:43:03,647
what happened to the kids in the mountains, and you're dead meat.

484
00:43:03,912 --> 00:43:05,007
Do you understand?

485
00:43:05,711 --> 00:43:07,477
What are you so afraid of?

486
00:43:09,722 --> 00:43:10,817
What?

487
00:43:10,992 --> 00:43:15,216
Oh, because you let a friend die to save yourself?

488
00:43:15,822 --> 00:43:16,926
Is that it?

489
00:43:18,191 --> 00:43:19,830
What do you know?

490
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:21,326
Stop pretending to be tough.

491
00:43:21,831 --> 00:43:24,627
I can see how terrified you are.

492
00:44:29,202 --> 00:44:30,897
It won't be long until you turn into...

493
00:44:31,231 --> 00:44:32,627
a monster yourself.

494
00:44:40,981 --> 00:44:42,176
Shut it.

495
00:44:42,711 --> 00:44:43,946
I won't.

496
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:45,777
Never.

497
00:44:57,031 --> 00:45:00,327
Everyone. For us to be able to ascend,

498
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:05,566
we must leave all our sins here on earth.

499
00:45:07,042 --> 00:45:10,610
That way, we won't be bogged down by our sins anymore.

500
00:45:10,611 --> 00:45:11,976
Absolutely.

501
00:45:12,412 --> 00:45:16,177
So what must we do now?

502
00:45:16,281 --> 00:45:20,921
- We must cleanse our souls. - We must cleanse our souls.

503
00:45:20,922 --> 00:45:22,117
That's right.

504
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:27,731
We must empty ourselves of our sins completely.

505
00:45:27,732 --> 00:45:28,987
- We believe. - We believe.

506
00:45:38,901 --> 00:45:42,941
If we do that, we can reach the new paradise...

507
00:45:42,942 --> 00:45:47,110
on the vessel of redemption with the New Savior!

508
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:50,780
- We believe! - We believe!

509
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:51,852
It will come true!

510
00:45:51,852 --> 00:45:55,990
- We believe! - We believe!

511
00:45:55,991 --> 00:45:57,487
We believe!

512
00:45:58,062 --> 00:45:59,356
It will come true!

513
00:46:00,562 --> 00:46:02,291
- It will come true! - It will come true!

514
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:05,200
We believe. Save us.

515
00:46:05,201 --> 00:46:08,070
We believe.

516
00:46:08,071 --> 00:46:09,796
It will come true.

517
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:29,447
Now,

518
00:46:30,022 --> 00:46:35,057
think of your sins that you must cleanse yourself from.

519
00:46:39,431 --> 00:46:43,896
(Evangelize for the New Paradise)

520
00:46:52,241 --> 00:46:55,206
We are now ready to ascend to the new paradise...

521
00:46:55,482 --> 00:46:58,976
and the moment of redemption is here!

522
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:37,517
It's okay.

523
00:47:45,002 --> 00:47:46,097
Stop!

524
00:48:05,982 --> 00:48:07,217
Send the kid...

525
00:48:07,991 --> 00:48:09,287
to me.

526
00:48:09,792 --> 00:48:11,316
You still don't understand?

527
00:48:11,692 --> 00:48:14,657
There is nothing you can do for this kid.

528
00:48:15,462 --> 00:48:17,501
Let Do Yoon's soul be redeemed.

529
00:48:17,502 --> 00:48:18,927
Stop this nonsense.

530
00:48:19,361 --> 00:48:21,396
This is not redemption. This is murder!

531
00:48:24,102 --> 00:48:26,197
Shut it, you demon!

532
00:48:28,741 --> 00:48:31,436
Do Yoon, hurry up and drink.

533
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:39,177
This is your last warning.

534
00:48:39,752 --> 00:48:40,847
Detective.

535
00:48:43,352 --> 00:48:44,956
Do you still not see it?

536
00:48:45,761 --> 00:48:48,061
The world is coming to an end.

537
00:48:48,062 --> 00:48:49,287
Before it's too late,

538
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:52,501
aboard the vessel of redemption with us.

539
00:48:52,502 --> 00:48:54,126
Enough!

540
00:48:55,131 --> 00:48:58,697
Then how about we let the kid choose?

541
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:02,166
Does she really want to stay here with you,

542
00:49:02,471 --> 00:49:05,037
in the world that is coming to an end?

543
00:49:06,312 --> 00:49:08,546
Do Yoon. Don't you...

544
00:49:09,181 --> 00:49:11,517
want to see your mom again?

545
00:49:12,022 --> 00:49:13,117
I...

546
00:49:14,622 --> 00:49:16,316
want to see her.

547
00:49:17,122 --> 00:49:18,956
Do you want to come with us...

548
00:49:19,221 --> 00:49:21,927
or stay here with that woman?

549
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:25,956
Kid.

550
00:49:26,801 --> 00:49:27,996
Come to me.

551
00:49:28,571 --> 00:49:30,436
Your mom asked me to protect you.

552
00:49:31,642 --> 00:49:33,767
Let me keep that promise.

553
00:49:34,841 --> 00:49:37,307
Do Yoon. Come on.

554
00:49:51,491 --> 00:49:52,657
Do Yoon.

555
00:49:54,662 --> 00:49:56,226
Come to me.

556
00:50:33,901 --> 00:50:36,697
How dare you ruin the plans of our New Savior?

557
00:50:37,142 --> 00:50:38,396
Run away, now!

558
00:52:15,772 --> 00:52:18,796
4 times 4 is 16. 4 times 5 is 20.

559
00:52:20,341 --> 00:52:23,907
4 times 6 is 24. 4 times 7 is 28.

560
00:52:23,942 --> 00:52:25,876
- Kid. - 4 times 8 is...

561
00:52:26,111 --> 00:52:27,507
Where are you?

562
00:52:35,622 --> 00:52:37,456
My mom...

563
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:41,586
would always find me whenever I would hide.

564
00:52:43,332 --> 00:52:44,961
There you are.

565
00:52:44,962 --> 00:52:48,371
Did you think I wouldn't find you if you hid here?

566
00:52:48,372 --> 00:52:51,066
How did you know I was here, Mom?

567
00:52:51,102 --> 00:52:52,700
It was your smell.

568
00:52:52,701 --> 00:52:56,010
Not a bad smell. A really nice smell.

569
00:52:56,011 --> 00:52:58,907
Do Yoon. Do Yoon! Jung Do Yoon!

570
00:53:03,082 --> 00:53:04,246
Mom!

571
00:53:04,821 --> 00:53:08,121
Do Yoon. Are you okay? Are you hurt?

572
00:53:08,122 --> 00:53:09,717
I'm okay.

573
00:53:09,792 --> 00:53:11,387
My baby.

574
00:53:13,392 --> 00:53:17,796
She said she could find me because I have a nice smell.

575
00:53:25,272 --> 00:53:26,867
It's okay now.

576
00:53:34,781 --> 00:53:37,847
My mom trusted you.

577
00:53:39,321 --> 00:53:41,416
So I trust you too.

578
00:53:52,201 --> 00:53:53,896
We must get out of here.

579
00:53:55,372 --> 00:53:56,566
Let's go.

580
00:54:20,732 --> 00:54:21,887
(Emergency Equipment)

581
00:54:53,861 --> 00:54:56,461
Please forgive us for our sins.

582
00:54:56,462 --> 00:54:59,557
As we forgive those who caused...

583
00:55:10,642 --> 00:55:13,380
Go away. Get away from me.

584
00:55:13,381 --> 00:55:16,610
Satan. You devil!

585
00:55:16,611 --> 00:55:19,677
Go away! Step away!

586
00:55:20,381 --> 00:55:23,316
I command you in the name of our New Savior!

587
00:55:23,392 --> 00:55:25,117
Leave!

588
00:55:25,861 --> 00:55:28,360
Leave!

589
00:55:28,361 --> 00:55:30,657
(Muji Hospital)

590
00:55:42,042 --> 00:55:43,307
Hey.

591
00:55:46,482 --> 00:55:47,807
What now?

592
00:55:48,752 --> 00:55:51,717
That bite. It's from a mutant, isn't it?

593
00:55:51,752 --> 00:55:52,947
A mutant?

594
00:55:53,252 --> 00:55:55,947
That's what we call people whose eyes turned black.

595
00:55:55,951 --> 00:55:58,391
Don't change the topic. Roll up your sleeve.

596
00:55:58,392 --> 00:55:59,617
Why should I?

597
00:56:00,261 --> 00:56:01,791
I'm right.

598
00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:03,686
Officer Cho, handcuff him.

599
00:56:07,272 --> 00:56:10,070
- Will you let it go? - Come on now.

600
00:56:10,071 --> 00:56:12,936
Don't you know you're abusing your authority?

601
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:15,240
I'm not abusing my authority.

602
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:18,007
I'm doing my job to protect the public.

603
00:56:18,111 --> 00:56:19,336
Undo it.

604
00:56:21,381 --> 00:56:24,121
Doctor, there's something you must see.

605
00:56:24,122 --> 00:56:26,617
- What is it? - There's a survivor.

606
00:56:26,922 --> 00:56:28,791
What? Where?

607
00:56:28,792 --> 00:56:30,517
In the lab on the fifth floor.

608
00:56:36,662 --> 00:56:38,526
Someone survived.

609
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:44,396
Look at that.

610
00:56:45,272 --> 00:56:47,706
The surgical ward was shut down.

611
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:53,641
(Help! There are survivors here.)

612
00:56:53,642 --> 00:56:55,007
Wait.

613
00:57:01,022 --> 00:57:03,487
Look. Isn't that your wife?

614
00:57:08,261 --> 00:57:11,157
Daddy's off to work. See you.

615
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:13,927
Take care!

616
00:57:15,201 --> 00:57:16,626
That's my wife.

617
00:57:16,732 --> 00:57:19,237
My Ji Hye's up there!

618
00:59:09,082 --> 00:59:10,307
Hwa Sun!

619
00:59:24,332 --> 00:59:25,526
Hwa Sun!

(All child actors underwent psychological therapy.)

622

(Dark Hole)

623
01:00:26,491 --> 01:00:27,731
Don't lie.

624
01:00:27,732 --> 01:00:30,291
You know no one's coming to rescue us.

625
01:00:30,292 --> 01:00:31,961
What are you doing?

626
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:34,626
What if everyone here got infected?

627
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:37,001
The expectant mother isn't doing well.

628
01:00:37,002 --> 01:00:40,101
To save everyone else, sacrifices must be made!

629
01:00:40,102 --> 01:00:42,941
Would you have said that if they were your family?

630
01:00:42,942 --> 01:00:44,041
Hwa Sun!

631
01:00:44,042 --> 01:00:45,641
I think someone's controlling them.

632
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,976
Open the door quick.

633
01:00:49,082 --> 01:00:51,347
The black smoke wasn't the end of it.
