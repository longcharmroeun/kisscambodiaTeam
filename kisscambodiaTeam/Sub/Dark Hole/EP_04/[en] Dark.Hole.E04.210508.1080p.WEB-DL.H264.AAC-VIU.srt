00:01:02,192 --> 00:01:04,360
Tae Han, we got a report.

3
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:07,796
It looks like Kang Soo stole from a claw machine store.

4
00:01:14,672 --> 00:01:16,307
Nice one.

5
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:20,777
Hey, Tae Han. You're back.

6
00:01:26,682 --> 00:01:27,917
Come out here.

7
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:30,451
Give me a moment. It's the last game.

8
00:01:30,452 --> 00:01:31,987
I said come here!

9
00:01:32,752 --> 00:01:35,117
Why are you yelling again?

10
00:01:35,691 --> 00:01:37,891
Is it because you're a cop now?

11
00:01:37,892 --> 00:01:39,926
You steal when your brother's a cop?

12
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,330
- What? - You promised,

13
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:44,727
that you wouldn't steal again.

14
00:01:46,242 --> 00:01:48,236
It wasn't me, okay?

15
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:50,307
Okay.

16
00:01:50,412 --> 00:01:51,966
Let's go to the police station.

17
00:01:52,371 --> 00:01:54,376
It really wasn't me!

18
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:57,406
You're just the same.

19
00:01:57,552 --> 00:02:00,016
Even if no one else believes me, you should.

20
00:02:00,382 --> 00:02:01,620
That's family!

21
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,191
How dare you talk back at me?

22
00:02:03,192 --> 00:02:04,817
I went there to win something.

23
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,557
I kept our promise!

24
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,126
Hey!

25
00:02:23,712 --> 00:02:24,936
Hello.

26
00:02:28,212 --> 00:02:29,507
Are you sure?

27
00:02:31,082 --> 00:02:32,777
It wasn't Kang Soo?

28
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:40,317
Okay, bye.

I'll buy you the real deal one day, not a fake.

32
00:03:01,311 --> 00:03:03,906
I spent 10 dollars trying to win this.

- He looks badly hurt. - Oh, dear...

34
00:03:34,441 --> 00:03:36,780
- He's bleeding badly. - Let's call 911.

35
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:38,681
- Is he dead? - We're at...

36
00:03:38,682 --> 00:03:40,451
- I'll give you my number. - There was an accident.

37
00:03:40,452 --> 00:03:42,277
Get here quick.

38
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,156
It looks bad. His helmet came off.

Look at that.

42
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,797
The surgical ward was shut down.

44
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:38,267
Wait.

45
00:04:40,411 --> 00:04:42,837
Look. Isn't that your wife?

46
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:49,746
That's my wife.

47
00:04:51,351 --> 00:04:54,286
Daddy's off to work. See you.

48
00:04:55,592 --> 00:04:56,957
Take care!

49
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:01,096
My Ji Hye's up there!

50
00:05:07,371 --> 00:05:09,697
No! Ji Hye!

51
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:11,140
What happened?

52
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:13,736
Why is your wife up there?

53
00:05:13,912 --> 00:05:17,046
Our baby's almost due, so she said she'd see the doctor.

54
00:05:17,412 --> 00:05:20,476
I couldn't reach her on her phone, so I assumed she was at home.

55
00:05:20,682 --> 00:05:22,447
How do we get up there?

56
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:25,791
That ward was closed. It's surrounded by mutants.

57
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:26,991
It's too dangerous.

58
00:05:26,992 --> 00:05:28,916
Should we leave his wife there, then?

59
00:05:29,992 --> 00:05:32,226
What is it? Do you have a plan?

60
00:05:34,261 --> 00:05:36,596
No. I'll figure one out as I go along.

62

63
00:08:20,201 --> 00:08:21,997
- Are you okay? - Yes.

64
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:23,666
Follow us to the school.

65

67
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:30,666
I'm a teacher here.

Go on. I'll be right behind you.

72

Hurry up and take the kid.

73

Come on.

74
00:09:21,522 --> 00:09:22,686
Come on. Hurry.

75

What... What just happened?

82

- Are you okay? - I'm okay. It's nothing serious.

83

- Did you hurt your arm? - Yes, I think I sprained it.

- It's not a big deal. - Let me take a look.

It's okay.

What do you think you're doing?

88
00:11:14,002 --> 00:11:16,867
What if they're all infected?

89
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:20,676
Sir, they're not infected.

90
00:11:21,341 --> 00:11:23,647
They just needed help.

91
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:27,117
Then what about them?

92
00:11:29,752 --> 00:11:33,122
What if they become dangerous because of these two?

93

Will you take responsibility then?

95
00:11:38,361 --> 00:11:40,497
Hurry up and kick them out!

96
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,397
That's enough.

97
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:47,336
You're starting to make me sick.

98

Tell me if these are the eyes of someone infected.

Your wife was with other people,

170
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:48,777
Let's go by ourselves.

171
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,446
Soon Il.

172
00:16:11,502 --> 00:16:13,897
- Gosh. - Where are you going?

173
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,217
Hey, are you still wearing that?

174
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,046
Let's go.

175
00:16:34,262 --> 00:16:36,460
- Will they be okay? - My goodness.

176
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:39,131
- It's dangerous out there. - Gosh.

177
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:40,656
(Fire door)

178
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:16,926
Stay calm and take deep, steady breaths.

179
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:40,017
- Ma'am. - Yes?

180
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:44,227
Should we take her to the negative pressure room on the fourth floor?

181
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:47,296
What are you planning to do?

182
00:17:47,362 --> 00:17:50,826
Hey, don't tell me you're trying to get out of here.

183
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:54,336
The mutants have just disappeared.

184
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:56,437
This is our chance to move.

185
00:17:56,471 --> 00:17:58,811
Are you saying we're going to open the door?

186
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:00,106
What do you suggest then?

187
00:18:01,082 --> 00:18:02,737
Should we all just die here?

188
00:18:02,842 --> 00:18:05,777
Is it okay for us to move by ourselves?

189
00:18:05,981 --> 00:18:09,050
I think we should wait for the rescue team or the police.

190
00:18:09,051 --> 00:18:10,280
What do you think?

191
00:18:10,281 --> 00:18:13,517
I also think it's dangerous to go out.

192
00:18:14,122 --> 00:18:17,091
This lady's condition is pretty serious.

193
00:18:17,092 --> 00:18:18,891
She needs to be moved to a safer place.

194
00:18:18,892 --> 00:18:21,997
Gosh. No place is safe in this situation.

195
00:18:22,062 --> 00:18:24,626
Isn't the negative pressure room safe?

196
00:18:27,842 --> 00:18:30,811
You're right. There, we can control the air pressure...

197
00:18:30,812 --> 00:18:33,341
so that the smoke doesn't get in.

198
00:18:33,342 --> 00:18:36,581
Also, the inner and outer doors will keep the mutants out.

199
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,780
Listen. There's no way...

200
00:18:38,781 --> 00:18:41,750
we can take that pregnant woman all the way there safely.

201
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:44,646
What if some mutants pop out on the way?

202
00:18:45,221 --> 00:18:47,046
We'll figure something out.

203
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:52,960
I'll lead the way.

204
00:18:52,961 --> 00:18:55,296
You guys protect the lady.

205
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,527
What should we do?

206
00:18:59,132 --> 00:19:00,427
Look.

207
00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:03,040
Let's stop thinking.

208
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,371
In a situation like this,

209
00:19:04,372 --> 00:19:07,477
it's best to listen to a civil servant.

210
00:19:07,582 --> 00:19:08,937
Goodness.

211
00:19:09,741 --> 00:19:10,947
Fine, let's do that.

212
00:19:11,781 --> 00:19:15,747
All of you, grab something that can be used as a weapon.

213
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:26,457
Thank you.

214
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,536
Are you okay?

215
00:19:35,572 --> 00:19:37,296
Thank you for your help.

216
00:19:37,812 --> 00:19:39,440
It must not have been easy.

217
00:19:39,441 --> 00:19:40,980
Don't mention it.

218
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:43,606
I just wanted to save as many people as I could.

219
00:19:44,781 --> 00:19:48,646
Anyway, why do you think the black smoke and the mutants...

220
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:50,786
suddenly disappeared?

221
00:19:53,051 --> 00:19:56,816
I think they responded to the strange, high-frequency sound.

222
00:19:57,862 --> 00:19:59,527
A high-frequency sound?

223
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:03,796
I didn't hear anything.

224
00:20:05,001 --> 00:20:06,396
Really?

225
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,697
Yes.

226
00:20:15,941 --> 00:20:19,780
What could the sound...

227
00:20:19,781 --> 00:20:21,780
that only you heard be?

228
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:23,717
I don't know anything for sure yet,

229
00:20:23,852 --> 00:20:26,447
but considering how the mutants suddenly stopped attacking,

230
00:20:27,491 --> 00:20:29,757
I think they're being controlled by something.

231
00:20:36,031 --> 00:20:40,096
By the way, I haven't introduced myself.

232
00:20:40,102 --> 00:20:42,866
My name is Choi Seung Tae.

233
00:20:44,971 --> 00:20:47,636
I'm Detective Lee Hwa Sun from Seoul.

234
00:21:03,622 --> 00:21:05,056
Move, you punk!

235
00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:10,727
What on earth happened here?

236
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:13,167
What...

237
00:21:14,602 --> 00:21:15,796
What happened?

238
00:21:17,072 --> 00:21:20,407
Goodness. What is this?

239
00:21:20,741 --> 00:21:22,437
This is bad.

240
00:21:27,451 --> 00:21:29,550
The person you have reached is unavailable...

241
00:21:29,551 --> 00:21:30,886
Darn it!

242
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:35,856
You little punk.

243
00:21:35,922 --> 00:21:39,431
Didn't I tell you to keep an eye on this place?

244
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:41,460
- You did. - And?

245
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:43,730
What happened to the door?

246
00:21:43,731 --> 00:21:45,866
Why are all my cows gone?

247
00:21:46,731 --> 00:21:50,141
You stupid punk. What were you doing...

248
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,907
when all my babies disappeared?

249
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:53,066
You idiot.

250
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,566
Who are you?

251
00:22:22,402 --> 00:22:24,707
You have been chosen.

252
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,536
You will soon meet the one who chose you.

253
00:23:29,615 --> 00:23:31,149
How's it going?

254
00:23:35,554 --> 00:23:36,980
Are you okay?

255
00:23:37,794 --> 00:23:39,550
Yes, I'm fine.

256
00:23:41,465 --> 00:23:43,690
Nothing seems to be happening right now.

257
00:23:45,865 --> 00:23:48,329
I hope they can stay away from the mutants.

258
00:23:49,935 --> 00:23:53,573
Doctor, I'll go check on the generator for a second.

259
00:23:53,574 --> 00:23:55,700
- Sure, go ahead. - Okay.

260
00:24:05,314 --> 00:24:08,149
Wait. All the mutants are gone from this place.

261
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:12,089
(Muji Hospital, 2nd floor)

262
00:24:27,574 --> 00:24:29,339
Is there another way we can get there?

263
00:24:29,974 --> 00:24:31,369
One second.

264
00:24:33,274 --> 00:24:34,579
Hello?

265
00:24:35,044 --> 00:24:36,679
Yes, this is the security office.

266
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:38,349
Let me see.

267
00:24:38,385 --> 00:24:40,414
Turn the corner you're at,

268
00:24:40,415 --> 00:24:43,323
and at the end of the corridor on the left is a staircase.

269
00:24:43,324 --> 00:24:45,119
It's deserted at the moment.

270
00:25:45,054 --> 00:25:47,523
- It's too dangerous to leave now. - Let me leave.

271
00:25:47,524 --> 00:25:49,079
- You can't... - Listen.

272
00:25:49,584 --> 00:25:52,493
The smoke's gone and so have the mutants.

273
00:25:52,494 --> 00:25:54,464
How long must I stay here for?

274
00:25:54,465 --> 00:25:56,763
Whether it's to an army base or another city,

275
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:58,364
let's do something.

276
00:25:58,365 --> 00:26:01,003
You two are way too noisy.

277
00:26:01,004 --> 00:26:02,200
Listen.

278
00:26:03,304 --> 00:26:06,829
Why are you making a fuss, miss, when they want to leave?

279
00:26:07,574 --> 00:26:09,669
Can a man get some sleep?

280
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,414
My wife and kid are waiting for me,

281
00:26:12,415 --> 00:26:14,844
and you want me to sit here and do nothing?

282
00:26:14,845 --> 00:26:18,079
You can stay here. I'm leaving.

283
00:26:18,385 --> 00:26:22,579
Whoever of you wants to go, you can come with me.

284
00:26:22,685 --> 00:26:24,223
We can't leave now.

285
00:26:24,224 --> 00:26:26,124
- Not yet. - We can't go yet.

286
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:27,389
I'm leaving too.

287
00:26:28,925 --> 00:26:30,594
- Let's go. - Us too.

288
00:26:30,595 --> 00:26:31,990
Okay. Let's all go.

289
00:26:32,264 --> 00:26:33,530
Dad.

290
00:26:36,834 --> 00:26:38,030
What are you doing?

291
00:26:39,534 --> 00:26:41,139
Where are you going?

292
00:26:42,804 --> 00:26:46,240
Dad. Don't go.

293
00:26:49,345 --> 00:26:50,639
Dad.

294
00:26:51,054 --> 00:26:53,349
Dad, don't leave us.

295
00:26:54,355 --> 00:26:56,579
Open the door quickly.

296
00:26:57,185 --> 00:26:59,223
You can't leave on your own.

297
00:26:59,224 --> 00:27:00,419
Let go.

298
00:27:01,324 --> 00:27:02,490
Let go of me.

299
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:08,599
Honey. You can't leave us.

300
00:27:08,705 --> 00:27:11,369
Dad, save me!

301
00:27:11,474 --> 00:27:13,333
- Dad! - My gosh.

302
00:27:13,334 --> 00:27:15,144
You're out of your mind.

303
00:27:15,145 --> 00:27:17,374
- Take us with you! - No.

304
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:18,914
- You trash! - It's not true.

305
00:27:18,915 --> 00:27:20,313
You can't leave us here!

306
00:27:20,314 --> 00:27:22,010
I'm not your husband!

307
00:27:23,345 --> 00:27:25,149
You all die if you go outside.

308
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:26,879
Who are you?

309
00:27:27,415 --> 00:27:28,780
Then leave.

310
00:27:30,554 --> 00:27:33,720
If you don't do as I say, you'll be severely punished.

311
00:27:35,425 --> 00:27:38,359
You just have to show these people.

312
00:27:40,395 --> 00:27:41,700
You're crazy.

313
00:27:41,804 --> 00:27:44,000
How dare a shaman talk like that to me?

314
00:27:44,504 --> 00:27:45,669
Come along.

315
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,669
- Let's go. - Okay, let's.

316
00:27:47,774 --> 00:27:49,674
- Wait. - I'm going voluntarily.

317
00:27:49,675 --> 00:27:51,013
- Don't. - Stay.

318
00:27:51,014 --> 00:27:53,374
- Where will you go? - You can't leave.

319
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:55,379
- Stay here. - Oh, dear...

320
00:27:57,715 --> 00:27:59,010
They're really leaving.

321
00:28:14,195 --> 00:28:16,260
What rotten luck.

322
00:28:16,734 --> 00:28:17,869
What?

323
00:28:18,175 --> 00:28:21,569
It's nothing. Let's get going.

324
00:28:22,544 --> 00:28:25,169
He showed me everything.

325
00:28:59,744 --> 00:29:02,884
- Open the door! Let me in! - Get lost, freak!

326
00:29:02,885 --> 00:29:05,454
- Open the door! The door! - Darn it.

327
00:29:05,455 --> 00:29:06,954
Why won't it start?

328
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:09,654
Open the door! Open up! Let me in!

329
00:29:09,655 --> 00:29:12,149
Open the door! Save me!

330
00:29:13,754 --> 00:29:14,960
Darn it.

331
00:29:15,165 --> 00:29:16,659
Why won't it start?

332
00:29:20,665 --> 00:29:22,599
- They're dead. - They died.

333
00:29:22,705 --> 00:29:23,864
My goodness.

334
00:29:23,865 --> 00:29:26,273
Ms. Kim, you were right.

335
00:29:26,274 --> 00:29:27,803
You said they'd die if they left.

336
00:29:27,804 --> 00:29:28,944
They did.

337
00:29:28,945 --> 00:29:31,444
- That's right. - She did warn them.

338
00:29:31,445 --> 00:29:34,710
- This is so scary. - What is going on?

339
00:29:35,244 --> 00:29:38,154
- What should we do? - I want this to go away.

340
00:29:38,155 --> 00:29:41,720
That shaman is going to cause bloodshed.

341
00:30:05,744 --> 00:30:07,810
- Oh, dear. - Will you look at this?

342
00:30:08,044 --> 00:30:09,243
I'm sorry, sir.

343
00:30:09,244 --> 00:30:12,950
It's not like the kids have ever hammered a nail before.

344
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:16,283
If they are poor at it, you should've taught them.

345
00:30:16,284 --> 00:30:18,124
Must I tell you what to do in detail?

346
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:19,819
No, sir. I apologize.

347
00:30:21,564 --> 00:30:23,260
Are you kidding me?

348
00:30:24,195 --> 00:30:26,164
Jin Seok. Let go. We can talk it out.

349
00:30:26,165 --> 00:30:29,800
Hey mister. Are you playing games with me?

350
00:30:30,105 --> 00:30:32,773
You can have pickled radish if you want.

351
00:30:32,774 --> 00:30:34,644
Eat it.

352
00:30:34,645 --> 00:30:35,740
Hey!

353
00:30:37,605 --> 00:30:40,270
You can't talk to a teacher like that.

354
00:30:42,615 --> 00:30:45,409
Do you still think I'm a student here?

355
00:30:45,955 --> 00:30:48,819
Hey. You guys expelled me.

356
00:30:49,284 --> 00:30:52,124
You kicked me out and now you want to teach me?

357
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:53,419
Hey, rude kid.

358
00:30:56,494 --> 00:30:57,524
What?

359
00:30:57,524 --> 00:31:00,159
If you're not a kid, why are you such a picky eater?

360
00:31:01,365 --> 00:31:05,230
Oh. Are you showing off because you're a detective?

361
00:31:06,205 --> 00:31:07,300
Darn you...

362
00:31:15,514 --> 00:31:16,879
Oh, no.

363
00:31:18,855 --> 00:31:20,050
Don't do it.

364
00:31:35,764 --> 00:31:36,859
Open your eyes.

365
00:31:51,044 --> 00:31:52,149
Stand up.

366
00:32:02,665 --> 00:32:05,589
What? What are you staring at?

367
00:32:26,115 --> 00:32:27,810
Grandma told you to come and eat.

368
00:32:27,925 --> 00:32:30,250
- Over there. Do you see it? - See what?

369
00:32:30,254 --> 00:32:31,690
Over there.

370
00:32:32,595 --> 00:32:35,659
We could play catch if we had that, right?

371
00:33:00,715 --> 00:33:03,119
You're awesome, Do Yoon.

372
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:08,720
Good luck.

373
00:33:46,534 --> 00:33:50,099
Hey! It's dangerous! Get back, quick!

374
00:33:56,245 --> 00:33:57,340
Hey!

375

376
00:34:20,035 --> 00:34:21,094
Why did you go outside?

377
00:34:21,095 --> 00:34:23,130
You know what happens if you inhale smoke.

378
00:34:24,774 --> 00:34:26,829
Tell me! Why did you go outside?

379
00:34:27,035 --> 00:34:29,239
If we're to fight the mutants,

380
00:34:29,245 --> 00:34:31,239
you need a gun.

381
00:34:31,675 --> 00:34:33,409
You're a detective.

382
00:34:38,084 --> 00:34:39,380
Wait.

383
00:34:52,394 --> 00:34:54,290
Your name's Do Yoon, right?

384
00:34:55,765 --> 00:34:58,534
Gosh, you're amazing, Do Yoon.

385
00:34:58,535 --> 00:35:01,199
You're really brave.

386
00:35:02,544 --> 00:35:07,174
But don't do anything dangerous like this from now on.

387
00:35:07,175 --> 00:35:08,380
Okay?

388
00:35:10,845 --> 00:35:12,753
Why don't you go on inside?

389
00:35:12,754 --> 00:35:16,079
I need to talk to Detective Lee.

390
00:35:16,854 --> 00:35:18,049
Do Yoon.

391
00:35:35,805 --> 00:35:38,070
You may be good at catching criminals,

392
00:35:38,675 --> 00:35:41,610
but you're not very good when it comes to talking to kids.

393
00:35:44,015 --> 00:35:46,009
What she did was reckless.

394
00:35:46,954 --> 00:35:48,719
She knows that.

395
00:35:49,325 --> 00:35:53,119
But even so, she chose to risk her life for you.

396
00:35:54,095 --> 00:35:56,360
I know this may sound out of line,

397
00:35:57,995 --> 00:36:00,060
but don't shut people out too much.

398
00:36:00,535 --> 00:36:04,259
We all need to work together in order to overcome this.

399
00:36:13,544 --> 00:36:15,813
Put some tripe on top of a perilla leaf.

400
00:36:15,814 --> 00:36:19,150
Then add some glass noodles on top. What comes next?

401
00:36:19,414 --> 00:36:21,114
- Garlic. - Yes, you put garlic on top.

402
00:36:21,115 --> 00:36:22,724
- Then you wrap it up. - You wrap it...

403
00:36:22,725 --> 00:36:24,020
and put it in my mouth.

404
00:36:24,624 --> 00:36:27,023
Are you a pig? Why are you eating everything?

405
00:36:27,024 --> 00:36:28,393
You guys are amateurs.

406
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,523
He actually tried to steal my food earlier.

407
00:36:30,524 --> 00:36:32,860
Don't you guys know what Chapaguri is?

408
00:36:32,865 --> 00:36:34,535
Mix it with your right hand

409
00:36:34,535 --> 00:36:36,103
Mix it with your left hand

410
00:36:36,104 --> 00:36:39,029
You're talking about Bibimmyeon, you dumb fool.

411
00:36:40,635 --> 00:36:42,239
My gosh, seriously.

412
00:36:43,544 --> 00:36:46,739
Hey, I told you punks to be quiet.

413
00:36:47,445 --> 00:36:50,340
What are you looking at? What do you want?

414
00:36:51,015 --> 00:36:52,683
Have you lost your mind?

415
00:36:52,684 --> 00:36:55,384
Hey, quit being a jerk and just get lost.

416
00:36:55,385 --> 00:36:57,320
You couldn't even say a word to that detective earlier.

417
00:37:02,064 --> 00:37:03,563
Have you all gone nuts?

418
00:37:03,564 --> 00:37:06,230
What? What do you want?

419
00:37:09,104 --> 00:37:12,199
You just wait and see. I'll get back at you for this.

420
00:37:16,004 --> 00:37:19,009
He should be embarrassed of himself. Why are you up? Lie back down.

421
00:37:19,144 --> 00:37:21,683
Should we just go and beat the soul out of him?

422
00:37:21,684 --> 00:37:23,143
- Should we do that? - Should we?

423
00:37:23,144 --> 00:37:24,540
Shut it.

424
00:37:27,785 --> 00:37:31,750
Kid, where did your mother go? Why are you here alone?

425
00:37:32,495 --> 00:37:34,049
She isn't...

426
00:37:34,965 --> 00:37:36,420
my mom.

427
00:37:38,195 --> 00:37:39,764
My mom is...

428
00:37:39,765 --> 00:37:42,560
It's okay. Don't bother.

429
00:37:43,035 --> 00:37:46,029
You don't need to tell me anything.

430
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:49,969
Let's go eat with Chan.

431
00:38:11,865 --> 00:38:13,230
What are you doing?

432
00:38:14,265 --> 00:38:15,730
I bet you're enjoying this.

433
00:38:16,905 --> 00:38:18,203
What are you talking about?

434
00:38:18,204 --> 00:38:20,299
You think you know my weakness.

435
00:38:21,374 --> 00:38:22,770
Go ahead and tell everyone.

436
00:38:23,144 --> 00:38:25,273
Just go tell them so I can kill you.

437
00:38:25,274 --> 00:38:26,739
I told you...

438
00:38:27,144 --> 00:38:29,210
to tell me how you're going to kill me.

439
00:38:33,715 --> 00:38:36,150
Let me know once you come up with a creative way...

440
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:38,989
to kill me.

441
00:38:40,725 --> 00:38:43,820
Although I'm not sure if you're smart enough to think of something.

442
00:39:22,465 --> 00:39:25,634
Do Yoon! Do as the detective says.

443
00:39:25,635 --> 00:39:28,099
You must live. Okay?

444
00:39:29,144 --> 00:39:33,310
Detective! Drive! Now!

445
00:39:36,285 --> 00:39:38,040
My mom...

446
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:42,179
would always find me whenever I would hide.

447
00:39:45,624 --> 00:39:47,219
It's okay now.

448
00:39:56,434 --> 00:39:57,860
It's cold at night.

449
00:39:59,075 --> 00:40:00,570
Thank you.

450
00:40:05,115 --> 00:40:07,810
Kids become friends so quickly.

451
00:40:09,515 --> 00:40:12,210
I'm sure you'll also become good friends with her.

452
00:40:15,624 --> 00:40:19,849
I don't know how I should treat her.

453
00:40:22,725 --> 00:40:27,190
When I look into her eyes, I can see how desperate she is.

454
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:30,929
But I'm not sure if I'll be able to protect her.

455
00:40:32,004 --> 00:40:33,429
I'm scared.

456
00:40:35,504 --> 00:40:36,840
Well...

457
00:40:37,405 --> 00:40:39,969
I'm sure she just wants...

458
00:40:40,945 --> 00:40:42,210
to be reassured...

459
00:40:43,015 --> 00:40:46,150
that you're always going to be with her.

460
00:40:47,015 --> 00:40:50,719
So you don't need to try too hard.

461
00:41:19,115 --> 00:41:20,310
Gosh!

462
00:41:20,655 --> 00:41:22,049
Be quiet.

463
00:41:27,095 --> 00:41:28,719
This is Doctor Han Ji Soo.

464
00:41:30,894 --> 00:41:31,964
Yes.

465
00:41:31,965 --> 00:41:34,829
There's an emergency exit near the Cardiovascular Center.

466
00:41:34,865 --> 00:41:37,259
I think it'll be best for you to exit through there.

467
00:41:37,765 --> 00:41:39,529
Okay, got it.

468
00:41:51,544 --> 00:41:54,980
(Muji Hospital, 3rd floor)

469
00:41:59,495 --> 00:42:00,849
The police should lead the way.

470
00:42:16,374 --> 00:42:19,770
(Muji Hospital, 4th floor)

471
00:42:49,305 --> 00:42:50,799
What is it?

472
00:42:55,414 --> 00:42:57,380
I think we're good.

473
00:42:58,184 --> 00:42:59,579
Let's go.

474
00:42:59,814 --> 00:43:02,250
- Are you okay? - Yes.

475
00:43:03,524 --> 00:43:07,420
I should hang in there for the sake of my baby.

476
00:43:17,265 --> 00:43:18,360
What?

477
00:43:19,204 --> 00:43:20,670
Look over there.

478
00:43:21,874 --> 00:43:23,969
What are they doing there?

479
00:43:25,914 --> 00:43:27,869
That's the fourth floor.

480
00:43:29,285 --> 00:43:30,744
They're heading to the negative pressure room.

481
00:43:30,745 --> 00:43:32,453
The smoke can't get in there,

482
00:43:32,454 --> 00:43:34,150
so they're heading there for safety.

483
00:43:34,984 --> 00:43:36,083
Do you hear me?

484
00:43:36,084 --> 00:43:39,320
The people on the fifth floor are on their way...

485
00:43:39,394 --> 00:43:40,920
The people on the fifth...

486
00:43:43,095 --> 00:43:44,259
What is she saying?

487
00:43:44,465 --> 00:43:45,934
The people on the fifth floor are on their way...

488
00:43:45,934 --> 00:43:47,994
to the negative pressure room on the fourth floor.

489
00:43:47,995 --> 00:43:50,130
They're on the 4th floor, not the 5th.

490
00:43:52,575 --> 00:43:55,199
Officer Cho, can you hear me?

491
00:43:55,575 --> 00:43:56,869
The fourth floor?

492
00:43:58,175 --> 00:43:59,639
What does she want us to do on the fourth floor?

493
00:44:00,175 --> 00:44:01,610
I think she's telling us to go to the fourth floor.

494
00:44:01,945 --> 00:44:03,480
My gosh. Give me that.

495
00:44:05,555 --> 00:44:07,150
Can you speak more...

496
00:44:11,885 --> 00:44:13,849
Can you speak more clearly?

497
00:44:13,854 --> 00:44:16,219
Officer Cho, can you hear me?

498
00:44:38,914 --> 00:44:40,250
What's wrong?

499
00:44:41,115 --> 00:44:46,449
I think I've seen that guard somewhere.

500
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:48,349
What do you mean?

501
00:44:50,825 --> 00:44:51,920
Never mind.

502
00:44:52,595 --> 00:44:54,529
I'm probably just being paranoid.

503
00:45:40,814 --> 00:45:41,909
Run!

504
00:46:16,184 --> 00:46:17,340
Hurry up!

505
00:46:41,734 --> 00:46:43,840
Did you see how I exercised my public authority?

506
00:46:46,245 --> 00:46:48,440
Couldn't you shoot sooner?

507
00:46:49,445 --> 00:46:51,009
I almost died.

508
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:18,875
Those who refuse to follow me will all die.

509
00:47:19,981 --> 00:47:22,576
Those who refuse to follow me will all die.

510
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:25,446
Those who refuse to follow me will all die.

511
00:47:25,581 --> 00:47:27,145
Those who refuse to follow me...

512
00:47:27,621 --> 00:47:30,585
Those who refuse to follow me will all die.

513
00:47:30,921 --> 00:47:33,355
Those who refuse to follow me will all die.

514
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:37,355
Those who refuse to follow me will all die.

515
00:48:25,175 --> 00:48:26,839
Tell me what you want.

516
00:48:27,445 --> 00:48:29,040
I can make anything happen.

517
00:48:50,635 --> 00:48:52,299
Accept me.

518
00:48:53,775 --> 00:48:57,899
Then you can get revenge.

519
00:48:59,315 --> 00:49:00,469
Who are you?

520
00:49:01,874 --> 00:49:03,710
Why did you stop attacking earlier?

521
00:49:04,014 --> 00:49:05,379
Because it's fun...

522
00:49:06,115 --> 00:49:08,719
to make them do whatever I want.

523
00:50:52,824 --> 00:50:54,219
Who did this?

524
00:51:10,105 --> 00:51:11,200
Sir!

525
00:51:12,144 --> 00:51:14,910
Wake up. Are you okay? Sir!

526
00:51:15,445 --> 00:51:16,609
Sir!

527
00:51:18,045 --> 00:51:20,250
We should hurry up and move him to the shelter.

528
00:51:20,615 --> 00:51:22,980
We can't move him there. We'll scare the people.

529
00:51:23,284 --> 00:51:25,623
We could move him to the counseling office.

530
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,419
- Let's do that. - Okay.

531
00:51:28,054 --> 00:51:29,623
- I'll carry him. - Be careful.

532
00:51:29,624 --> 00:51:31,424
- Let's go. - Are you okay?

533
00:51:31,425 --> 00:51:32,533
Be careful.

534
00:51:32,534 --> 00:51:34,930
Let's hurry up.

535
00:51:42,874 --> 00:51:43,969
Hurry up.

536
00:51:44,505 --> 00:51:45,609
Move.

537
00:51:47,974 --> 00:51:49,080
All right.

538
00:51:53,885 --> 00:51:55,584
Do we have first-aid supplies?

539
00:51:55,585 --> 00:51:59,354
To treat this wound, we need to get supplies from the nurse's office.

540
00:51:59,355 --> 00:52:01,924
We can't enter the annex because of the mutants.

541
00:52:01,925 --> 00:52:04,660
If he's not treated, he'll go into shock from blood loss.

542
00:52:09,005 --> 00:52:10,430
I'll go get them.

543
00:52:11,804 --> 00:52:13,604
Tell me where the nurse's office is.

544
00:52:13,605 --> 00:52:15,770
It's too dangerous to enter the annex.

545
00:52:17,105 --> 00:52:19,509
You two risked your lives to save me.

546
00:52:20,615 --> 00:52:21,810
What do we need?

547
00:52:22,244 --> 00:52:24,814
A suture kit, hydrocolloid bandages,

548
00:52:24,815 --> 00:52:27,984
dressings, NSAIDs, and hydrogen peroxide.

549
00:52:27,985 --> 00:52:30,623
Also, povidone-iodine and dry powder, just in case.

550
00:52:30,624 --> 00:52:33,424
Grab as many painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs as you can.

551
00:52:33,425 --> 00:52:34,589
Okay.

552
00:52:41,365 --> 00:52:42,460
Detective.

553
00:52:43,335 --> 00:52:45,870
Do you think this is civil defense training?

554
00:52:47,905 --> 00:52:50,200
We're at war.

555
00:52:50,804 --> 00:52:53,910
Do not act up without my permission.

556
00:52:53,974 --> 00:52:56,584
If he's not treated immediately, he might die.

557
00:52:56,585 --> 00:52:58,710
Yes, he might.

558
00:52:58,815 --> 00:53:02,419
We all might because of you.

559
00:53:03,454 --> 00:53:06,723
I own this school. I'm in charge.

560
00:53:06,724 --> 00:53:10,823
Everyone here is my responsibility.

561
00:53:10,824 --> 00:53:12,634
If you can't take responsibility for one person,

562
00:53:12,635 --> 00:53:14,660
how will you take responsibility for everyone here?

563
00:53:15,235 --> 00:53:16,700
Isn't it funny?

564
00:53:17,164 --> 00:53:21,104
Wherever you go, there's always one troublemaker...

565
00:53:21,105 --> 00:53:23,669
who puts everyone in danger.

566
00:53:24,704 --> 00:53:26,509
- What did you say? - That's why...

567
00:53:27,244 --> 00:53:30,810
order and control are absolutely important.

568
00:53:31,115 --> 00:53:34,384
We can't let the one troublemaker who popped out of nowhere...

569
00:53:34,385 --> 00:53:36,350
ruin everything for us.

570
00:53:38,025 --> 00:53:41,649
Tell the truth. What is it you really want?

571
00:53:44,795 --> 00:53:47,794
Stay here under my control,

572
00:53:47,795 --> 00:53:51,533
or in return for getting the medical supplies you want,

573
00:53:51,534 --> 00:53:53,230
leave this school.

574
00:53:58,605 --> 00:53:59,770
Fine.

575
00:54:00,275 --> 00:54:02,843
I'll get the medical supplies, then leave.

576
00:54:02,844 --> 00:54:03,944
Detective.

577
00:54:03,945 --> 00:54:07,279
Oh, yes. I'm so forgetful.

578
00:54:07,885 --> 00:54:10,484
You came with a kid. Leave with the kid.

579
00:54:10,485 --> 00:54:13,623
Stop it, Father. Anyone who leaves will die!

580
00:54:13,624 --> 00:54:16,819
To save everyone else, sacrifices must be made!

581
00:54:18,624 --> 00:54:20,259
Is that not true?

582
00:54:21,235 --> 00:54:25,000
Director Choi. Sending the child too is a bit...

583
00:54:27,605 --> 00:54:32,100
Do you want to go instead, Mr. Song?

584
00:54:36,385 --> 00:54:37,609
Dong Rim.

585
00:54:37,985 --> 00:54:41,049
Wow, Han Dong Rim.

586
00:54:42,324 --> 00:54:44,180
I have a plan.

587
00:54:44,525 --> 00:54:45,723
What is it?

588
00:54:45,724 --> 00:54:48,223
You can reach the nurse's office and avoid the mutants.

589
00:54:48,224 --> 00:54:49,790
You're out of your mind.

590
00:54:50,195 --> 00:54:51,560
Follow me.

591
00:54:56,005 --> 00:54:58,904
The quickest way there is to take the pedestrian overpass.

592
00:54:58,905 --> 00:55:00,134
(Pedestrian overpass)

593
00:55:00,135 --> 00:55:01,604
But as we fled over here,

594
00:55:01,605 --> 00:55:03,899
we locked all the doors to keep the mutants out.

595
00:55:04,605 --> 00:55:05,939
Where are the keys?

596
00:55:06,414 --> 00:55:09,310
The teacher who had the keys...

597
00:55:10,844 --> 00:55:12,379
became a mutant.

598
00:55:13,115 --> 00:55:15,149
You can get there without the keys.

599
00:55:15,284 --> 00:55:17,850
- What? - This door is broken.

600
00:55:19,624 --> 00:55:20,794
Sir, what are you doing?

601
00:55:20,795 --> 00:55:23,620
I'm taking a look because they say this door won't lock.

602
00:55:23,724 --> 00:55:25,460
I think this needs to be replaced.

603
00:55:25,735 --> 00:55:27,489
- The whole thing? - Yes.

604
00:55:34,034 --> 00:55:37,069
You lot are so frustrating.

605
00:55:37,505 --> 00:55:39,140
What are you doing here?

606
00:55:42,275 --> 00:55:45,343
Well... I came to help.

607
00:55:45,344 --> 00:55:46,879
What are you up to?

608
00:55:48,385 --> 00:55:52,250
A man's at death's door. Should I just sit and watch?

609
00:55:52,695 --> 00:55:54,620
I'm not that much of a jerk.

610
00:55:54,655 --> 00:55:58,660
And, like she said, if the doors open...

611
00:55:58,965 --> 00:56:02,029
How are they to pass the study hall corridor?

612
00:56:02,565 --> 00:56:04,834
We don't know how many mutants there are and where.

613
00:56:04,835 --> 00:56:07,700
Do you three think you can fight through them?

614
00:56:10,344 --> 00:56:13,339
Are you saying you have another plan?

615
00:56:16,144 --> 00:56:20,350
I'm pretty smart when it comes to being sly.

616
00:56:21,615 --> 00:56:24,379
Tell me. What is your sly trick?

617
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:31,589
Are you good at being a distraction?

618
00:57:34,295 --> 00:57:35,489
Hey.

619
00:57:37,224 --> 00:57:39,134
- Do you hear me? - What's that?

620
00:57:39,135 --> 00:57:40,560
Where is it coming from?

621
00:57:42,164 --> 00:57:45,000
- It's not mine. - Yes, Detective.

622
00:57:45,534 --> 00:57:49,339
You won't believe me, but I saw something in the smoke.

623
00:57:49,644 --> 00:57:52,100
The black smoke might not be the end of it.

624
00:57:53,074 --> 00:57:55,739
What do you mean the black smoke's not the end?

625
00:57:56,744 --> 00:57:58,439
Inside the black smoke,

626
00:57:58,985 --> 00:58:02,149
I think is a being we don't yet know about.

627
00:58:02,724 --> 00:58:04,049
Be careful.

628
00:58:06,355 --> 00:58:08,689
Detective. Detective?

629
00:58:08,994 --> 00:58:11,460
What detective? Who was that?

630
00:58:11,764 --> 00:58:13,529
She's a detective from Seoul.

631
00:58:15,764 --> 00:58:19,100
She said there's another being in the black smoke.

632
00:58:19,974 --> 00:58:21,129
What?

633
00:58:32,485 --> 00:58:35,680
(To be operated by medical personnel only)

634
00:58:37,155 --> 00:58:40,319
We pumped his stomach and we found a pesticide.

635
00:58:40,655 --> 00:58:43,560
He can leave after the IV drip's done and he wakes up.

636
00:58:58,505 --> 00:59:00,339
Sir, it's me.

637
00:59:01,014 --> 00:59:05,210
I think this idiot ingested some pesticide. Yes.

638
00:59:05,954 --> 00:59:08,680
I'll bring him in after his drip is done.

639
00:59:28,574 --> 00:59:29,674
What do I do?

640
00:59:29,675 --> 00:59:31,870
- Check Room 503's vitals. - Okay.

641
01:00:22,724 --> 01:00:24,060
Sir.

642
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:49,054
(All child actors underwent psychological therapy.)

643
01:00:49,054 --> 01:00:51,419
(Special thanks to Lee Cheol Min.)

644
01:01:08,005 --> 01:01:10,500
(Dark Hole)

645
01:01:10,945 --> 01:01:12,600
The black smoke...

646
01:01:12,605 --> 01:01:15,109
is watching us, not attacking us.

647
01:01:15,945 --> 01:01:19,314
That's why you should not trust people. You must trust him.

648
01:01:19,315 --> 01:01:20,984
It's the mark of the chosen.

649
01:01:20,985 --> 01:01:22,980
Listen to me carefully.

650
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:24,283
Hey!

651
01:01:24,284 --> 01:01:27,049
Do you think you can run from them?

652
01:01:27,195 --> 01:01:30,120
Go, Detective. You'll end up in danger too.

653
01:01:30,324 --> 01:01:32,219
There's no time to wait. Hurry!
