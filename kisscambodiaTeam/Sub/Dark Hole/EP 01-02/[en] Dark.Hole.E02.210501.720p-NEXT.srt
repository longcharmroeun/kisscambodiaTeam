1
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,070
Why did you do it?

2
00:00:40,424 --> 00:00:43,190
Why did you kill him?

3
00:00:45,595 --> 00:00:47,360
Hwa Sun.

4
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,680
Sung Bum.

5
00:01:06,783 --> 00:01:10,480
Don't do this. This isn't like you.

6
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,610
Well done.

7
00:02:06,676 --> 00:02:10,110
(Dark Hole)

8
00:02:10,814 --> 00:02:13,810
(Episode 2)

9
00:02:47,984 --> 00:02:50,080
(Sessak Foundation Scholarship Selection)

10
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:03,090
Next year, reduce the number to five.

11
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,660
Pardon?

12
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,900
We're giving out too many scholarships.

13
00:03:08,071 --> 00:03:10,370
If anyone can get it,

14
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:13,100
how is that a scholarship?

15
00:03:13,243 --> 00:03:14,610
You're right.

16
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:18,940
It must be a special thing if the recipient is to be grateful.

17
00:03:20,383 --> 00:03:21,680
Director Choi.

18
00:03:21,685 --> 00:03:24,450
I'll brief you on the procedure of the scholarship awarding ceremony.

19
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,450
- First... - Leave it.

20
00:03:27,857 --> 00:03:32,290
We do the same thing every year. I know the order by heart.

21
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:36,730
Director Choi, you truly are remarkable.

22
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:41,100
If that's all, you can leave, Mr. Choi.

23
00:03:41,104 --> 00:03:44,000
There is one more thing I'd like to run by you.

24
00:03:44,274 --> 00:03:46,000
Mr. Choi.

25
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:49,340
I said we'll discuss that later.

26
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,910
What is it?

27
00:03:51,915 --> 00:03:54,480
Well, it's about...

28
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:58,880
I asked you before that we treat our school janitors...

29
00:04:00,023 --> 00:04:01,420
Mr. Choi.

30
00:04:01,424 --> 00:04:05,120
Your job is to teach the kids well!

31
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:07,930
I'm the one who runs the school.

32
00:04:07,964 --> 00:04:09,790
Do you understand?

33
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,830
I do.

34
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:16,300
Mr. Choi. You're excused.

35
00:04:25,115 --> 00:04:27,380
What a mess.

36
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:31,120
He's so soft and weak.

37
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:33,450
Oh, dear...

38
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:46,500
My gosh. This is crazy.

39
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:51,270
Officer Park. This is a sinkhole, isn't it?

40
00:04:51,975 --> 00:04:54,210
It should be on the Guinness Book of Records.

41
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,510
As if!

42
00:04:57,914 --> 00:04:59,910
I'll take a selfie.

43
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:03,780
(Police)

44
00:05:03,787 --> 00:05:06,850
Hey! What was that for?

45
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,350
What? What?

46
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:12,520
You pushed me. Be honest!

47
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:16,230
Why would I push you?

48
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:20,600
Darn it. I can't see the bottom.

49
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,970
All of this is the director's land, and it might end up worth nothing.

50
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:26,270
What director?

51
00:05:26,643 --> 00:05:28,740
You don't need to know.

52
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:34,710
I must've left it in the car to charge.

53
00:05:34,784 --> 00:05:37,080
Will you stop taking photos?

54
00:05:39,356 --> 00:05:43,360
Barricade this place with tape so that no one can come in here.

55
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,860
What?

56
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,260
All by myself?

57
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:50,660
Just do what you're told.

58
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,300
Okay, sir.

59
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,770
Who is this?

60
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,540
Sir, this is Park Soon Il.

61
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:08,350
We have a problem.

62
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:11,080
We found a big hole at the place...

63
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:13,720
where you plan to build a sanatorium.

64
00:06:13,857 --> 00:06:16,790
A hole? What hole?

65
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,290
Well...

66
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:21,890
It's a pretty big hole.

67
00:06:21,898 --> 00:06:23,460
What are you talking about?

68
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,400
Why is there a hole suddenly in the middle of the mountain?

69
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:30,570
Well, I think it's a sinkhole.

70
00:06:30,573 --> 00:06:33,740
A sink... A sinkhole?

71
00:06:34,544 --> 00:06:37,780
Do you know how much money got invested in that land?

72
00:06:38,214 --> 00:06:39,580
No matter how much is needed...

73
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:42,180
gather people and fill up that hole by today.

74
00:06:42,185 --> 00:06:44,950
If you don't want to get fired, you'd better get it done.

75
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:48,520
Okay, sir. I'll deal with it.

76
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,600
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

77
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:03,070
How am I going to fill this hole up?

78
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:07,270
Hey, this is upside down! Do it properly!

79
00:07:27,597 --> 00:07:29,160
Who are you?

80
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:40,640
What's your deal?

81
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:46,480
You're fine.

82
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:59,290
Why do you keep pointing a gun at me? You're a cop.

83
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:05,030
Don't you remember?

84
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:08,270
You almost killed me up in that mountain.

85
00:08:16,212 --> 00:08:17,710
Well done.

86
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:28,850
You're okay, right?

87
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:41,670
Hey, wait.

88
00:08:42,805 --> 00:08:44,840
What did you see in that hole?

89
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,770
Tell me.

90
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,870
My friend's eyes turned black like yours and he went weird.

91
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,910
You must know something.

92
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:57,520
- Sung Bum. - Don't do this.

93
00:08:57,754 --> 00:08:59,350
This isn't like you.

94
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:11,160
Hello?

95
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,360
Hwa Sun, I just found CCTV footage...

96
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:16,070
of Lee Soo Yeon's car that was taken a month ago.

97
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,570
It was taken in front of Jingan Tunnel in Muji City.

98
00:09:18,575 --> 00:09:20,540
I'll send you the footage right away.

99
00:09:20,543 --> 00:09:22,240
Jingan Tunnel?

100
00:09:22,345 --> 00:09:23,810
Thanks.

101
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,450
I'm sorry. I didn't see anything.

102
00:09:28,451 --> 00:09:29,950
I'll be off now.

103
00:09:30,386 --> 00:09:31,880
Hey, wait.

104
00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:53,840
It'll take you three hours to get to that tunnel on foot.

105
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:07,320
Get in.

106
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:16,160
- Hello. - Hello.

107
00:10:16,432 --> 00:10:18,100
Don't run.

108
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,970
Sir, what are you doing?

109
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:27,040
I'm taking a look because they say this door won't lock.

110
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,440
I think this needs to be replaced.

111
00:10:28,444 --> 00:10:30,040
I see. Do you need to replace the whole thing?

112
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,380
Yes, it seems like it's totally broken.

113
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,250
I don't think this will do.

114
00:10:34,484 --> 00:10:35,980
Hey, Dong Rim.

115
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,320
What happened?

116
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:43,920
It's nothing.

117
00:10:43,926 --> 00:10:45,590
It's obviously not nothing.

118
00:10:45,595 --> 00:10:47,460
You should go to the nurse's office.

119
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:50,400
I'll go later.

120
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,130
I'm teaching your next class, so you can just go.

121
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,140
Guys, it's time for class now.

122
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,050
Do you know what number to call?

123
00:11:12,155 --> 00:11:13,820
What number?

124
00:11:13,823 --> 00:11:16,520
The number to a counselling center or a welfare center.

125
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,760
(A call for help for teenagers)

126
00:11:22,465 --> 00:11:25,160
It's useless to stay quiet alone.

127
00:11:25,168 --> 00:11:28,500
No one will know unless you speak out first.

128
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,980
(911 Ambulance)

129
00:11:46,522 --> 00:11:49,090
Sir. Sir.

130
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:51,760
Sir.

131
00:11:54,664 --> 00:11:56,060
How is his condition?

132
00:11:56,065 --> 00:11:59,230
He suddenly threw up and started having seizures.

133
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:02,300
Sir, can you hear me?

134
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:04,170
Let's take him inside.

135
00:12:12,915 --> 00:12:15,050
Gosh. Hello?

136
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:17,950
Hey, Mr. Lim.

137
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:19,780
Director Choi gave me orders.

138
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:21,420
I need the hole filled up by today.

139
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:23,490
How many times do I need to tell you?

140
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:26,090
We don't have the equipment right now.

141
00:12:26,095 --> 00:12:28,790
Do you not get what's going on?

142
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:31,860
If you get on his bad side, you won't be able to do business.

143
00:12:31,868 --> 00:12:33,000
We need to fill it up by today.

144
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,570
If we don't, we'll both lose our jobs.

145
00:12:35,571 --> 00:12:39,140
Okay, fine. I'll bring out the tools tonight.

146
00:12:39,142 --> 00:12:41,340
What? Okay, okay.

147
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:46,140
And make sure not to tell anyone. Do you understand?

148
00:12:48,084 --> 00:12:51,780
Gosh, this punk. I was going to hang up first.

149
00:13:01,264 --> 00:13:03,930
Do you want me to give you what you want?

150
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:05,860
Do you want it?

151
00:13:06,169 --> 00:13:07,670
Tell me.

152
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:09,970
Do you want it or not?

153
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:49,540
Come.

154
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,240
Come to me.

155
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:59,480
Those who refuse to accept me will all die.

156
00:14:00,323 --> 00:14:03,620
"Those who refuse to accept me will all die."

157
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:07,390
Those who refuse to accept me will all die.

158
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:11,160
"Those who refuse to accept me will all die."

159
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:17,030
"Those who refuse to accept me will all die."

160
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,820
Those who refuse to accept me...

161
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,990
will all die.

162
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,630
What?

163
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,410
- Sir. - My gosh.

164
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:57,210
Gosh, you startled me.

165
00:14:57,213 --> 00:15:00,310
You are loved by the skies, sir.

166
00:15:02,084 --> 00:15:04,150
(Repent for paradise is near you. Get ready to greet the skies.)

167
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:08,690
Hey, I'm busy right now.

168
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:10,790
Get lost.

169
00:15:11,694 --> 00:15:13,990
The revelation of the skies will soon begin.

170
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,260
It's not too late to...

171
00:15:15,264 --> 00:15:18,530
What are you saying, you cultist? Stop ruining my day.

172
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,570
Hey, Han Dong Rim!

173
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:27,640
Hey, hey.

174
00:15:27,643 --> 00:15:29,640
I waited ages for you.

175
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:31,140
Let's talk.

176
00:15:32,415 --> 00:15:33,740
It's not about business.

177
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:36,980
I just want to chat, person to person.

178
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:40,920
I found an interesting video of you.

179
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,790
What are you looking at?

180
00:15:47,797 --> 00:15:50,790
- Raise your head, Dong Rim. - Come on.

181
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,160
Is this a joke to you? Hey.

182
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,640
You don't want your grandma to see this, do you?

183
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,670
What do you want from me?

184
00:15:59,675 --> 00:16:01,440
Don't be so cold.

185
00:16:01,444 --> 00:16:04,640
I just want to show you something cool.

186
00:16:04,914 --> 00:16:06,410
Hop on.

187
00:16:06,415 --> 00:16:08,880
Every time I'm here, it reminds me of when I got kicked out of school.

188
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,110
It feels annoying.

189
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,150
Let's go.

190
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,120
Come on.

191
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:21,190
- Walk faster. - Stop it.

192
00:16:21,931 --> 00:16:24,300
- What's wrong? - Faster.

193
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,530
- Jin Seok. Hey. - Are you out of your mind?

194
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:28,500
Where are we going?

195
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:31,770
Do you know what a sinkhole is?

196
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:34,910
It's the deep thing on the ground, right?

197
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,540
It's called a hole, stupid.

198
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:40,510
- It's the same thing anyway. - Gosh, so stupid.

199
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:42,180
It's not funny.

200
00:16:42,184 --> 00:16:44,550
Anyway, what about it?

201
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,820
There's one up here.

202
00:16:46,822 --> 00:16:49,020
Really? That's so cool.

203
00:16:49,025 --> 00:16:51,490
Hold on. Are you serious?

204
00:16:51,494 --> 00:16:54,530
You brought us all here just for a hole in the ground?

205
00:16:54,663 --> 00:16:56,530
What? You're not interested?

206
00:16:56,532 --> 00:16:59,230
Then go to work and fry chickens instead.

207
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:05,170
Come on. Don't be like that.

208
00:17:05,174 --> 00:17:07,340
You know how much I hate chickens.

209
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:09,670
- Let's go see it. - Let's go.

210
00:17:10,312 --> 00:17:12,310
Come. Let's go.

211
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:17,850
Hey.

212
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,220
Is this fun for you? What are you staring at?

213
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:37,170
Hey. Don't you think something's down there?

214
00:17:38,908 --> 00:17:41,240
- Hey! - Gosh.

215
00:17:42,878 --> 00:17:46,810
- Were you scared? - No. I wasn't scared at all.

216
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:51,150
Should we see what's down there?

217
00:17:56,692 --> 00:17:59,560
- Dong Rim. - Dong Rim.

218
00:17:59,562 --> 00:18:01,160
What?

219
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:03,490
What are you doing?

220
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,260
These guys' phones are new.

221
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:07,970
Let me borrow it, okay?

222
00:18:11,874 --> 00:18:13,300
(I've never seen the inside of a sinkhole before.)

223
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:15,170
(It's so dark.)

224
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:17,340
Gosh, it's super deep.

225
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,310
What is this? There's nothing in there.

226
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:20,880
It's boring.

227
00:18:20,883 --> 00:18:23,550
How far down is it going?

228
00:18:27,957 --> 00:18:30,750
Wait. What's wrong?

229
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:33,760
Gosh. Hey, can't you do better?

230
00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:35,790
What? I didn't do anything.

231
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:37,960
The screen turned black, punk.

232
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:40,400
I'm just holding the tape.

233
00:18:41,604 --> 00:18:44,700
What's going on? It feels like someone is pulling the tape.

234
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:48,140
Gosh, let me try. Pull.

235
00:18:48,177 --> 00:18:50,880
Gosh. Darn it.

236
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,740
What is this?

237
00:18:56,318 --> 00:18:59,320
- Gosh. - What just happened?

238
00:18:59,321 --> 00:19:01,350
It really felt like someone was pulling the tape.

239
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:03,250
What are you talking about?

240
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:05,690
Do you think there's a monster in there or something?

241
00:19:05,694 --> 00:19:08,660
Why are you such a coward?

242
00:19:08,664 --> 00:19:11,160
Gosh. Seriously.

243
00:19:14,703 --> 00:19:18,800
Gosh, I'm sorry. You don't even have parents to buy you a new phone.

244
00:19:18,807 --> 00:19:20,540
Why would you apologize?

245
00:19:20,543 --> 00:19:22,870
It's her phone's fault.

246
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,380
It's her phone that fell by itself!

247
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:28,150
Hey. You go in there and get it.

248
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:32,950
- Come on. - Are you ignoring me?

249
00:19:32,988 --> 00:19:35,120
- Come on. - Go and get it.

250
00:19:35,124 --> 00:19:37,960
- Let go of me. - Go and get your phone.

251
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,820
Let go!

252
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:44,660
Are you okay?

253
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,430
Are you out of your mind?

254
00:19:49,705 --> 00:19:52,540
Hey, why didn't you hold her properly?

255
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,670
Gosh, how can you be so strong when you're so tiny?

256
00:19:56,078 --> 00:19:58,110
Will you come to your senses if I break your bone?

257
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,080
Hey, do you have a death wish?

258
00:20:00,082 --> 00:20:03,080
Are you out of your mind? Are you?

259
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:05,550
What are you looking at?

260
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:22,070
- What's that? - What's going on?

261
00:20:25,074 --> 00:20:27,640
Hey. Are you okay?

262
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:32,080
What's wrong?

263
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,750
What are you doing?

264
00:20:36,852 --> 00:20:39,250
- I'll kill you all! - Let go!

265
00:20:39,255 --> 00:20:41,080
I'll kill you!

266
00:20:43,926 --> 00:20:46,190
Don't look at me like that!

267
00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:48,790
Die!

268
00:20:48,797 --> 00:20:51,460
Die! I want you to die!

269
00:20:51,467 --> 00:20:53,860
I'll kill you! Die!

270
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:56,070
Die!

271
00:20:56,071 --> 00:20:59,100
Die! I'll kill you all!

272
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,170
Die!

273
00:21:06,115 --> 00:21:07,810
Mom.

274
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:13,280
Don't go.

275
00:21:14,556 --> 00:21:16,350
Mom.

276
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:35,670
No way.

277
00:22:36,905 --> 00:22:38,800
Push!

278
00:22:43,312 --> 00:22:45,210
Push harder!

279
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:49,010
Harder!

280
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:47,640
What am I doing in the middle of the night?

281
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,710
Where are you?

282
00:23:49,711 --> 00:23:52,080
We don't have much time. Hurry up.

283
00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:56,650
Come on. I can't even see anything.

284
00:23:56,652 --> 00:23:59,320
Will you take responsibility if I have an accident?

285
00:23:59,321 --> 00:24:00,880
Cut it out.

286
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:04,090
If I lose my job, you will too. Don't you know that?

287
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:06,390
That's really not okay.

288
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,790
Whatever. I should just get it over with.

289
00:24:13,502 --> 00:24:17,970
(Tunnel ahead)

290
00:24:39,294 --> 00:24:41,120
The clip is a month old.

291
00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:42,860
The car belongs to a woman in her 20s.

292
00:24:42,865 --> 00:24:44,900
She's still missing.

293
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,760
The car enters the tunnel but doesn't come out.

294
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:51,470
I think it went out through a door in the middle of the tunnel.

295
00:25:18,467 --> 00:25:19,960
Hwa Sun.

296
00:25:31,146 --> 00:25:32,640
Sister.

297
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,950
Lee Soo Yeon!

298
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,060
Over here.

299
00:25:47,563 --> 00:25:49,360
I'm over here.

300
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:02,910
Sister.

301
00:26:15,123 --> 00:26:16,620
Black eyes.

302
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,580
Sung Bum.

303
00:26:47,756 --> 00:26:49,420
Don't go.

304
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,520
Wake up, please.

305
00:26:53,261 --> 00:26:55,630
You're in the hole again.

306
00:26:56,565 --> 00:26:58,360
Get out of there.

307
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,530
You can't go in too deep.

308
00:28:17,746 --> 00:28:20,410
There's no wi-Fi here.

309
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:23,550
I can't look up why your eyes turned black.

310
00:28:25,754 --> 00:28:31,590
Did you eat something weird in the mountain?

311
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:37,330
My friend's eyes turned black like yours.

312
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:41,300
My eyes turned black?

313
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:42,800
Yes.

314
00:28:45,774 --> 00:28:47,800
They're normal now.

315
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:50,740
It's so frustrating. I can't show you.

316
00:28:55,417 --> 00:28:57,350
I don't know why,

317
00:28:57,352 --> 00:28:59,550
but I see things out of the blue.

318
00:29:00,422 --> 00:29:01,920
You see things?

319
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,690
Young Sik too...

320
00:29:05,694 --> 00:29:07,460
Tae Han, my father is here.

321
00:29:07,462 --> 00:29:09,760
Your father passed away long ago. Pull yourself together.

322
00:29:09,765 --> 00:29:11,460
My father. He's here.

323
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:12,760
Nurse!

324
00:29:12,768 --> 00:29:16,470
I think he said he saw his dead father.

325
00:29:21,443 --> 00:29:23,110
What did you see?

326
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:26,110
Lee Soo Yeon.

327
00:29:27,048 --> 00:29:30,110
I saw the serial killer who murdered my husband.

328
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:33,720
Like the day she killed my husband,

329
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:37,150
she put a white cover over his head...

330
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:40,460
and injected him in the neck.

331
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:42,430
So...

332
00:29:43,498 --> 00:29:46,760
did you catch that Lee Soo Yeon?

333
00:29:47,435 --> 00:29:48,930
No.

334
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:53,600
I came here to Muji to catch her.

335
00:29:54,442 --> 00:29:56,340
Earlier, in the mountain,

336
00:29:56,511 --> 00:29:59,510
after I passed out on seeing the huge sinkhole,

337
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:03,980
I think I started seeing things.

338
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,780
Why did you do it?

339
00:30:07,823 --> 00:30:10,790
Why did you kill him?

340
00:30:15,463 --> 00:30:17,190
You should go to a hospital first.

341
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,460
It's on the way to town.

342
00:30:20,468 --> 00:30:21,960
The general hospital.

343
00:30:30,645 --> 00:30:32,480
- Oh, dear. - What happened?

344
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,010
- That scared me. - Goodness.

345
00:30:34,015 --> 00:30:35,680
- Darn it. - My gosh.

346
00:30:35,684 --> 00:30:37,810
- What are we doing? - You moron!

347
00:30:37,819 --> 00:30:40,150
You just put out a whole row of lights!

348
00:30:40,155 --> 00:30:42,320
I said it's dangerous to work at night!

349
00:30:42,324 --> 00:30:43,550
Darn you!

350
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:45,050
Darn me?

351
00:30:55,503 --> 00:30:57,170
What happened?

352
00:30:57,505 --> 00:30:59,170
Darn it.

353
00:30:59,174 --> 00:31:01,640
You idiots! Is this the best you can do?

354
00:31:01,643 --> 00:31:03,840
Did I or did I not say it's dangerous to work at night?

355
00:31:03,845 --> 00:31:06,610
- Darn you! - What are you staring at, punk?

356
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:08,140
- You... - Don't do it.

357
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:10,480
- Come on. Hit me. - Calm down.

358
00:31:10,485 --> 00:31:12,450
- Please, don't. - Let me go!

359
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:15,590
- You fool. - Come at me. I'll take you on.

360
00:31:21,363 --> 00:31:22,860
What happened?

361
00:31:24,866 --> 00:31:27,030
Mister! Can you do something?

362
00:31:27,035 --> 00:31:28,630
- We're stuck! - Mister.

363
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,530
You're in the way.

364
00:31:30,538 --> 00:31:31,970
There's nothing wrong here too.

365
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,640
Hey, mister.

366
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,740
What are you doing? Is this a joke?

367
00:31:35,744 --> 00:31:38,940
Sorry. We're trying to figure out what the problem is.

368
00:31:38,947 --> 00:31:41,910
- Give me a little more time. - I can't.

369
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,350
What's this now?

370
00:31:46,354 --> 00:31:47,820
Is it a text message?

371
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,520
- Oh, dear. - What does this mean?

372
00:31:59,467 --> 00:32:01,560
(Muji City Dong-Gu: Emergency, Black-out caused by utility pole)

Dong-Gu?

374
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,200
Mom's hospital is in Dong-Gu.

375
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,870
Why is there a blackout?

376
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:13,710
Did it really blow up?

377
00:32:13,748 --> 00:32:15,280
What do you mean?

378
00:32:15,283 --> 00:32:18,010
Don't you watch the news?

379
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,780
The sun exploded.

380
00:32:22,324 --> 00:32:25,350
- Isn't that Dong Rim? - Who? Dong Rim?

381
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,410
I apologize, Director.

382
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:53,550
Yes. Of course.

383
00:32:53,855 --> 00:32:55,520
I'll sort it out fast.

384
00:32:55,523 --> 00:32:57,020
Sure.

385
00:33:03,698 --> 00:33:07,000
Hey! Will you work faster?

386
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:10,170
You don't dare talk back to that old man.

387
00:33:10,171 --> 00:33:12,370
Don't you take it out on us.

388
00:33:12,374 --> 00:33:13,670
What?

389
00:33:13,675 --> 00:33:15,910
Why? Am I wrong?

390
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:17,670
Do you want to fight me?

391

- Shall we fight, then? Shall we? - Darn you!

- How dare you? - Don't.

Wait, stop, stop! Let go!

394
00:33:24,953 --> 00:33:27,920
- What are you faking this time? - No, wait.

395

What's that?

396
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,990
What is that?

What's that?

398
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,890
- Is that a fire? - Is it a person?

399
00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:41,430
- What's that? - What is this?

Gosh, is there something going on outside?

I don't want to end up conducting an autopsy on you.

Hey, how do you know if you'll be doing an autopsy on me?

415
00:35:04,085 --> 00:35:06,150
You might die before me.

416
00:35:11,726 --> 00:35:14,020
My cell phone doesn't work either.

417

Please go inside. Be careful.

Hey, sweetheart. It's me, your mother.

Let me inside.

- Don't run. Be careful. - Okay.

Can you help him first? Doctor, please.

not in front of our house?

00:44:07,595 --> 00:44:09,730
What? Wait.

507
00:44:17,204 --> 00:44:20,370
(Warm and Trustworthy Police)

508
00:44:24,612 --> 00:44:26,740
(Police)

509
00:44:29,216 --> 00:44:30,710
Hyun Ho.

510
00:44:32,053 --> 00:44:35,220
How many guns do we have?

511
00:44:35,222 --> 00:44:36,650
- What? - How many bullets...

512
00:44:36,657 --> 00:44:39,190
Give me a second. This is kind of hard to explain.

513
00:44:39,193 --> 00:44:40,490
- What are you talking about? - I should calm down.

514
00:44:40,494 --> 00:44:44,090
Park Soon Il, calm down.

515
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,760
Officer Park, open the door.

516
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,030
- I'm sorry. - Open up.

517
00:44:48,035 --> 00:44:49,230
The situation is a little...

518
00:44:49,236 --> 00:44:50,800
- Shouldn't we open the door? - Open up.

519
00:44:50,805 --> 00:44:53,070
- Be quiet. - Let me in.

520
00:44:53,074 --> 00:44:55,740
Gosh. Fine.

521
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:58,210
Hurry up.

522
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,010
You jerk.

523
00:45:01,015 --> 00:45:02,650
- Do you want to die? - Calm down. Sorry.

524
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:03,880
- How can you do this to me? - I'm sorry.

525
00:45:03,884 --> 00:45:05,780
I can't believe you.

526
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:09,150
My phone has no service.

527
00:45:09,156 --> 00:45:12,490
Use your radio and contact...

528
00:45:12,493 --> 00:45:14,790
the Blue House or the Police Agency or something.

529
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:17,360
- Officer Cho, radio the police. - Pardon?

530
00:45:17,364 --> 00:45:19,290
- Right now! - Okay.

531
00:45:22,603 --> 00:45:24,570
What are you doing? It's dangerous.

532
00:45:24,572 --> 00:45:28,070
Hey, why is it so quiet outside?

533
00:45:30,111 --> 00:45:33,640
Do you see that? They've gone crazy.

534
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:36,080
- Who are they? - Let me see.

535
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:37,980
Help!

536
00:45:43,891 --> 00:45:45,220
They're gone.

537
00:45:45,226 --> 00:45:47,220
Officer Cho, get something to barricade the door.

538
00:45:47,228 --> 00:45:49,090
Desks, chairs, or whatever.

539
00:45:49,096 --> 00:45:51,390
Officer Park. Do you think Ji Hye will be okay?

540
00:45:51,398 --> 00:45:52,460
Pull yourself together.

541
00:45:52,466 --> 00:45:55,630
Let's go get some chairs and stuff. Hurry up.

542
00:45:55,636 --> 00:45:58,700
Look for things we can use. Desks, chairs, or whatever.

543
00:45:58,706 --> 00:46:00,600
They can storm in any moment. Get moving.

544
00:46:00,608 --> 00:46:02,670
Hurry up. Get anything.

545
00:46:03,811 --> 00:46:07,480
Mr. Bae. Why are you on the floor?

546
00:46:07,481 --> 00:46:10,680
Mr. Bae. What are you doing?

547
00:46:11,886 --> 00:46:13,680
Mr. Bae.

548
00:46:13,788 --> 00:46:15,720
Mr. Bae.

549
00:46:16,257 --> 00:46:18,720
Hey! Mr. Bae.

550
00:46:19,393 --> 00:46:20,890
Mr. Bae.

551
00:46:21,796 --> 00:46:23,460
Pull yourself together, Mr. Bae.

552
00:46:29,003 --> 00:46:30,500
Fire!

553
00:46:38,179 --> 00:46:39,880
Hyun Ho! Get out!

554
00:46:42,183 --> 00:46:44,380
Bring me anything. Quick.

555
00:46:44,418 --> 00:46:46,650
Barricade the door.

556
00:46:47,188 --> 00:46:49,480
- There you go. - Hurry up.

557
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:54,360
That's enough. Let's go.

558
00:47:10,678 --> 00:47:14,180
Detective. Will my daughter be okay?

559
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:16,550
She'll be fine as long as she stays home.

560
00:47:29,396 --> 00:47:31,290
We don't have time. Let's leave the car here.

561
00:47:31,298 --> 00:47:33,160
- What? - She might become one of them.

562
00:47:33,167 --> 00:47:35,160
We should find her before that. Hurry.

563
00:47:35,169 --> 00:47:36,670
Okay.

564
00:48:19,246 --> 00:48:23,710
(Restricted Area)

565
00:48:31,191 --> 00:48:32,690
Young Sik.

566
00:48:43,037 --> 00:48:44,670
Young Sik.

567

Jung Do Yoon.

568
00:48:49,043 --> 00:48:50,540
Do Yoon.

569
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:06,120
Do Yoon.

570
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:23,570
There you are. My baby.

571
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:30,280
Do Yoon.

572
00:49:32,486 --> 00:49:33,980
Do Yoon.

573
00:49:34,989 --> 00:49:36,520
Do Yoon.

574
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:39,050
Do Yoon.

575
00:49:41,962 --> 00:49:43,290
Do Yoon.

576
00:49:43,297 --> 00:49:45,860
Do Yoon!

577
00:49:49,703 --> 00:49:51,470
Jung Do Yoon!

578
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:56,270
Do Yoon! Jung Do Yoon!

579
00:50:00,014 --> 00:50:01,610
Mom!

580
00:50:02,483 --> 00:50:03,850
I'm here.

581
00:50:03,851 --> 00:50:06,650
I'll come to you. Do Yoon!

582
00:50:06,653 --> 00:50:08,550
Keep calling me.

583
00:50:11,492 --> 00:50:13,590
Where are you?

584
00:50:31,979 --> 00:50:33,480
Young Sik.

585
00:50:56,770 --> 00:51:00,000
- Young Sik. - What is it, Father?

586
00:51:00,207 --> 00:51:02,170
Are you going to beat me again?

587
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,740
I can't stand it anymore.

588
00:51:08,615 --> 00:51:10,980
Stop beating me.

589
00:51:11,685 --> 00:51:13,480
If you don't stop,

590
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,550
I'll kill you.

591
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:18,090
Young Sik.

592
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,660
Come to your senses.

593
00:51:21,462 --> 00:51:24,130
I'll kill you!

594
00:51:58,232 --> 00:52:00,500
Snap out of it, you punk!

595
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,300
Do Yoon.

596
00:52:41,675 --> 00:52:44,470
- I'm coming to you. - Mom, where are you?

597
00:52:44,478 --> 00:52:46,710
Do Yoon.

598
00:52:46,713 --> 00:52:48,880
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

599
00:52:48,882 --> 00:52:50,880
I'm okay.

600
00:52:51,151 --> 00:52:52,650
My baby.

601
00:52:54,054 --> 00:52:55,750
Let's go now.

602
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:57,590
Come.

603
00:53:05,232 --> 00:53:06,860
You jerk.

604
00:53:06,867 --> 00:53:09,560
Get off of my Young Min.

605
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:12,370
I'm not Young Min.

606
00:53:12,372 --> 00:53:14,670
I'm Do Yoon. I'm Jung Do Yoon.

607
00:53:22,983 --> 00:53:24,480
Young Min.

608
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:26,980
Come to mommy.

609
00:53:26,987 --> 00:53:28,950
Mommy is sorry.

610
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:37,590
Get in, now!

611
00:53:40,567 --> 00:53:43,300
Get in. Get in, quick.

612
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,170
Mom!

613
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:02,020
- Mom! - Detective!

614
00:54:02,022 --> 00:54:04,090
Go! Now!

615
00:54:04,091 --> 00:54:06,250
Mom!

616
00:54:07,227 --> 00:54:08,860
Go!

617
00:54:10,764 --> 00:54:15,530
Do Yoon! Do as the detective says.

618
00:54:15,569 --> 00:54:17,500
You must live.

619
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,170
- Okay? - Mom!

620
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:23,470
Detective! Drive! Now!

621
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:28,110
Mom!

622
00:54:34,288 --> 00:54:35,850
Go!

623
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:37,920
Mom!

624
00:54:46,233 --> 00:54:48,600
It's dangerous. Hold on tight!

625
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:52,170
Mom!

626
00:55:26,773 --> 00:55:29,070
Mom.

627
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:32,370
Mom...

628
00:56:42,783 --> 00:56:44,450
Detective?

629
00:56:46,019 --> 00:56:47,720
Detective!

630
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:58,630
Are you okay?

631
00:56:58,632 --> 00:57:01,730
Yes. I'm okay.

632
00:57:19,653 --> 00:57:21,280
Let's go.

633
00:57:58,492 --> 00:58:00,250
Kid!

634
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:08,760
Kid?

635
00:58:42,235 --> 00:58:43,430
Kid!

636
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:45,400
If you hear this, come to Muji High School.

637
00:58:45,405 --> 00:58:47,400
- We have a shelter. - The school!

638
00:58:47,407 --> 00:58:49,570
- If you hear this, come over. - The school's this way!

639
00:58:49,576 --> 00:58:51,740
- We have a shelter. - Go to the school!

640
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,210
If you hear this, come to Muji High School.

641
00:58:55,215 --> 00:58:57,080
- Kid! - We have a shelter.

642
00:58:57,584 --> 00:58:59,980
If you hear this, come to Muji High School.

643
00:58:59,986 --> 00:59:01,850
We have a shelter.

644
00:59:01,855 --> 00:59:03,450
If you hear this, come to Muji High School.

645
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:05,350
We have a shelter.

646
00:59:21,608 --> 00:59:23,740
The smoke is coming!

647
00:59:39,593 --> 00:59:42,360
(Special thanks to Jung Hae Kyun Ahn Eun Jin, Tak Jae Hoon.)

648
00:59:59,479 --> 01:00:01,710
(Dark Hole)

649
01:00:01,715 --> 01:00:03,180
We must save the people outside.

650
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:04,750
Our students are out there.

651
01:00:04,751 --> 01:00:06,680
This is an emergency situation.

652
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,680
Do you want us all to die?

653
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,090
Our time of redemption is here!

654
01:00:13,093 --> 01:00:15,790
I understand that we may seem strange.

655
01:00:15,795 --> 01:00:18,190
Why did you take the child?

656
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:22,000
I saw you. That woman inhaled black smoke too.

657
01:00:22,002 --> 01:00:24,630
If he's infected, we'll all be in danger.

658
01:00:24,638 --> 01:00:27,700
I will never give up.

659
01:00:31,444 --> 01:00:34,010
My gosh. This is crazy.

660
01:00:34,013 --> 01:00:35,480
I think it's a sinkhole.

661
01:00:35,481 --> 01:00:37,440
A sinkhole?

662
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,550
What's that?

663
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,350
What did you see in the hole?

664
01:00:44,357 --> 01:00:46,790
- I saw something in the smoke. - Get a grip.

665
01:00:46,793 --> 01:00:49,890
Black eyes. Black smoke.

666
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,890
We must get out of here.

667
01:00:52,465 --> 01:00:54,160
Get in.

668
01:00:56,636 --> 01:00:59,370
(It will make you go, "Oh".)
