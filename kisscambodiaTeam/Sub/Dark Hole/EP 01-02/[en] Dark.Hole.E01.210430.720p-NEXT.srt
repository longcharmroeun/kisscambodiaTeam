Yes, I'll be back.

She's back.

51
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:13,336
Are you sure she's back?

52
00:09:13,503 --> 00:09:18,007
I think you should check for yourself.

53

NASA announced that they've observed...

54
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:28,351
massive sunspots on the Sun's photosphere.

55
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:29,986
According to NASA,

56

the current size of the sunspots has reached a critical level...

57

What if the world really comes to an end?

58
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:39,329
That'd be great. I won't have to pay off my debt.

Sir, Detective Lee Hwa Sun is here.

Are you serious? What if the captain finds out?

61
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,473
Do you want to get suspended...

62

Among all the cops in Korea,

65
00:09:55,878 --> 00:09:58,348
she's the most desperate one to catch the culprit.

66
00:09:58,348 --> 00:09:59,882
Do you think I don't know that?

67
00:09:59,882 --> 00:10:02,752
It's just that her personal feelings could mess up the investigation.

68
00:10:02,752 --> 00:10:03,953
But we can't just...

69
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:07,824
tell her to sit back and do nothing.

70
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,326
Hey, you're here.

71

Do my orders mean nothing to you?

76
00:10:26,643 --> 00:10:30,780
I need to check for myself if Soo Yeon's really back.

77
00:10:31,414 --> 00:10:34,550
You want to check? And do what?

78
00:10:34,617 --> 00:10:36,986
I told you to put your personal feelings aside.

79
00:10:36,986 --> 00:10:39,656
This is already the eighth victim.

80
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,492
Even my husband died.

81
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,761
How do you expect me to ignore this?

82
00:10:46,663 --> 00:10:50,633
Captain, let me catch the culprit.

83
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:52,535
Are you kidding me?

84
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,072
Sir, she came all the way here, so why don't you let her...

85
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,473
Seriously?

86
00:10:57,774 --> 00:10:59,208
Sorry, sir.

87
00:11:00,543 --> 00:11:03,046
I just visited my husband's grave.

88
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:08,017
You're right. I'm angry right now.

89
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,654
But it's not because I want personal revenge.

90
00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:15,358
It's because I feel obligated to solve this case as a detective.

91
00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:18,928
Fine.

92
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:23,433
But this is your last chance. Keep that in mind.

93
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,101
Okay, sir.

You made me starve all day...

100
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:33,870
just to eat this?

101

Hey, no one obeys the traffic rules when driving a tow truck.

102

Get to your senses, you punk.

103
00:12:41,911 --> 00:12:45,114
Watch how you talk to your boss.

104
00:12:46,048 --> 00:12:47,884
Boss, my foot.

105
00:12:47,884 --> 00:12:49,952
I don't care if it's illegal.

106
00:12:49,952 --> 00:12:51,554
We really need a police radio.

107
00:12:51,554 --> 00:12:54,724
I at least need to earn enough to pay for my phone bills.

- Let's go. - What...

113
00:13:06,235 --> 00:13:10,006
Gosh, that's hot! I spilled everything!

114
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:12,708
How can you be so selfish?

115
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:16,879
The people at NASA are keeping their eyes on the sunspots.

116

Recently, the sunspots have been...

117
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:22,652
causing small explosions, but the recent explosion was big...

118
00:13:22,652 --> 00:13:24,620
Hyun Ho, what are you doing?

119
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,490
An accident just occurred right by the underpass.

120
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,091
Oh, right.

121
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:30,593
I'll start the car.

122
00:13:30,593 --> 00:13:32,695
A malfunction in the communications equipment...

- may travel into space... - The world is about to end.

126

- from different electric devices... - I'll see you.

127
00:13:42,705 --> 00:13:45,641
- and get exposed to the particles, - Okay, bye.

128
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:48,744
which will then cause communication disruptions.

129
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:57,420
Goodness, Officer Park.

130
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:00,823
Gosh, what's he doing here?

131
00:14:00,957 --> 00:14:03,226
No wonder I craved kimchi stew today.

132
00:14:03,226 --> 00:14:04,861
I'm surprised to run into you here.

133
00:14:04,861 --> 00:14:07,730
Yes, the kimchi stew here is good. They give you a lot of meat.

134
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:08,898
Enjoy.

135
00:14:08,898 --> 00:14:11,534
Gosh, why are you leaving so quickly?

136
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:13,970
Why don't we talk for a bit?

137
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:16,239
We just got an accident report.

138
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:20,743
Do you think I'm here just to have some kimchi stew?

139
00:14:23,412 --> 00:14:25,548
Officer Park, are you coming?

140
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:27,817
Give me a second. I'm talking to this man.

141
00:14:30,586 --> 00:14:33,256
Then let's talk just for one minute, okay?

142
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,796
Do you realize you're already two days late?

143
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:44,166
Oh, that? It's ready. Don't worry.

144
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,434
It's true.

145
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:47,803
You said that last time too,

146
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,072
but you were one week late.

147
00:14:50,072 --> 00:14:52,775
I had no choice back then.

148
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:54,944
The deadline is tomorrow.

149
00:14:55,678 --> 00:14:58,047
If you don't make the payment by tomorrow night,

150
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,651
I'll barge into the police station for the money.

151
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,990
If you don't want to be humiliated,

152
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:10,293
do as I say.

153
00:15:10,293 --> 00:15:14,263
What? Well, okay.

154
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:28,044
Who is he?

155
00:15:29,745 --> 00:15:32,548
- An old friend. - What?

156
00:15:32,982 --> 00:15:36,085
It's really nice to see him after all these years.

157
00:15:36,585 --> 00:15:38,487
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

158
00:15:38,487 --> 00:15:40,256

Why did you stop? Step on it!

161
00:16:05,081 --> 00:16:07,416
That's why tow truck drivers are criticized.

162
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,085
My gosh.

163
00:16:09,618 --> 00:16:11,153
Then I'll criticize you first.

164
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:14,623
You stupid punk! We should go and make money!

165
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:16,892
Why would you stop here? Are you out of your mind?

166
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:20,763
Let's go before the other drivers take all the money away from us!

167
00:16:20,763 --> 00:16:22,832

Why did he stop here after speeding all the way?

170
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,175
Hey, what are you doing?

171
00:16:40,182 --> 00:16:42,485
- Oh, my. - My goodness.

172
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:49,158
- Gyung Min! - Yes?

173
00:16:49,325 --> 00:16:51,427
I saw you run all the red lights.

174
00:16:52,728 --> 00:16:54,964
- Did you make a report? - I did.

175
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:58,234
Help!

176
00:17:18,854 --> 00:17:21,357
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

177
00:17:21,357 --> 00:17:23,192
Sir, please get me out of here.

178
00:17:23,192 --> 00:17:25,094
An ambulance is on the way. Wait...

179
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:29,031
I can't breathe. Please.

180
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:36,705
It's okay. Give me just a second.

181
00:17:36,705 --> 00:17:38,407
Calm down.

182
00:17:40,543 --> 00:17:43,179
Calm down. Take a deep breath.

183
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:45,915
One, two...

184
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:52,488
You're doing well. Keep breathing.

185
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,824
Don't panic.

186
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,393
- You're beautiful. - What?

187
00:17:57,393 --> 00:18:00,696
You have a dog? What's the name?

188
00:18:01,864 --> 00:18:04,333
- It's Kongchi. - Kongchi?

189
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,102
How old is Kongchi?

190
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:08,370
She just turned three.

191
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,573
She must be adorable.

192
00:18:10,573 --> 00:18:12,942
My dog is old and barks all the time.

193
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:16,212
What's your dog's name?

194
00:18:16,212 --> 00:18:18,581
- My dog? - Yes.

195
00:18:18,581 --> 00:18:19,915
It's Youngsik.

196
00:18:19,915 --> 00:18:23,152
- Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine.

197
00:18:33,462 --> 00:18:36,132
Tae Han, the car's sparking!

198
00:18:42,671 --> 00:18:44,840
- Tae Han, it's on fire. - It's okay.

199
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,408
It's fine.

200
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:50,446
Gosh! Tae Han, the car is sparking. Get out of there!

201
00:18:50,446 --> 00:18:53,149
Get off me! Drag me out when I tell you to.

202
00:18:53,149 --> 00:18:56,519
It's okay. I'm almost done. Don't worry.

203
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,724
I'm almost done.

204
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:04,326
Young Sik!

205
00:19:05,261 --> 00:19:08,330
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

206
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:19,642
(Emergency Service)

207
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,722
Look at you. You make me proud.

208
00:19:33,722 --> 00:19:35,925
You haven't eaten all day. Don't you need a proper meal?

209
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,593
Do you want to go grab a beer?

210
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,161
No, thanks.

211
00:19:39,228 --> 00:19:42,264
Fine. Enjoy your popcorn, then.

212
00:19:42,531 --> 00:19:44,567
Just a second.

213
00:19:45,134 --> 00:19:46,969
Darn it.

214
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:51,740
What? What's wrong?

215
00:19:56,645 --> 00:19:58,080
Whose call are you waiting for?

216
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,449
It's not like that.

217
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,818
- A woman? - What do you take me for?

218
00:20:02,818 --> 00:20:05,421
- Is it another weird woman? - She's not weird.

219
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:06,855
- Name? - Yoon Saet Byeol.

220
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:08,324
- Is she from here? - She's from Seoul.

221
00:20:08,324 --> 00:20:10,259
- How old is she? - She's 22.

222
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,661
What does she do?

223
00:20:13,062 --> 00:20:15,497
Are you interrogating me?

224
00:20:15,698 --> 00:20:17,900
Hold on.

225
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:21,537
Your eyes are shaking.

226
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:26,508
- I bet she's weird. - She's not.

227
00:20:26,508 --> 00:20:29,979
She's an angel. A total angel.

228
00:20:53,035 --> 00:20:54,703
Gosh.

229
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:34,276
What's this?

230
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:52,061
Gosh.

231
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:05,708
Darn it.

232
00:22:23,292 --> 00:22:27,930
- You're a monster. - You're a monster.

233
00:22:28,697 --> 00:22:45,280
- You're a monster. - You're a monster.

234
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,883
Gosh, he looks horrible.

235
00:22:47,883 --> 00:22:51,153
How could you let him come to this school?

236
00:22:51,153 --> 00:22:52,588
He creeps the kids out.

237
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:54,022
What are you going to do?

238
00:22:54,022 --> 00:22:56,925
He should be transferred to another school or something.

239
00:22:56,925 --> 00:22:59,628
The kids are refusing to go to school because they're scared.

240
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,131
How can you tell me to calm down?

241
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:04,800
- Look at his face. - Transfer him immediately!

242
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,969
Gosh, he looks hideous.

243
00:23:10,572 --> 00:23:12,141
Stop coming to school from tomorrow.

244
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,777
It's our only yearbook. It's so annoying.

245
00:23:14,777 --> 00:23:17,946
Why can't you take a hint? Get lost right now.

246
00:23:17,946 --> 00:23:20,315
- Stop. - You stink. Get lost!

247
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,717
Please stop.

248
00:23:21,717 --> 00:23:23,952
Hey, stay away from him. You might get infected.

249
00:23:23,952 --> 00:23:26,855
- You jerks, I said, stop! - Stop!

250
00:23:26,855 --> 00:23:30,292
I said, stop, you jerks!

251
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:34,730
Please! Please stop!

252
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:38,267
Don't you want to get back at them? Let's kill them all.

253
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:42,371
Honey.

254
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:47,609
Don't call me that. I don't think of you as my husband.

255
00:23:49,912 --> 00:23:51,947
What did you just say?

256
00:23:52,948 --> 00:23:56,251
Didn't I tell you to stop looking at me like that?

257
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:00,389
Put that face away. You're scaring away our customers.

258
00:24:00,389 --> 00:24:03,158
How dare you talk to me like that?

259
00:24:03,158 --> 00:24:06,094
I'll gouge your eyes out today!

260
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:18,166
You're home. Are you hungry?

261
00:25:24,206 --> 00:25:26,074
Why are you standing there staring?

262
00:25:26,074 --> 00:25:27,943
Go change and get ready to eat.

263
00:25:48,196 --> 00:25:49,698
(Hwa Sun.)

264
00:25:49,698 --> 00:25:51,700
(How have you been?)

265
00:25:53,368 --> 00:25:55,737
(Are you asleep already? You're not, are you?)

266
00:25:55,737 --> 00:25:57,873
(I'm sorry I didn't go to your husband's funeral.)

267
00:25:57,873 --> 00:25:59,474
(Don't you want to see me?)

268
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,742
(I so want to see you.)

269
00:26:00,742 --> 00:26:02,978
(Do you want to know why I killed your husband?)

270
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,081
(Because you and he thought you could change me.)

271
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:07,482
(I really hated that.)

272
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,717
(So I killed him.)

273
00:26:08,717 --> 00:26:10,118
(Isn't that awesome?)

274
00:26:10,118 --> 00:26:11,587
(LOL)

275
00:26:11,587 --> 00:26:15,524
What if they'd grown with the love and care of parents?

276
00:26:15,757 --> 00:26:19,027
Then they wouldn't have gotten involved in crime,

277
00:26:19,027 --> 00:26:21,797
and they wouldn't have to live here.

278
00:26:23,065 --> 00:26:26,134
I think it's not too late for them.

279
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,105
Like we did for each other,

280
00:26:30,105 --> 00:26:32,774
if we trust and love those kids,

281
00:26:32,774 --> 00:26:34,142
don't you think they can change?

282
00:26:34,142 --> 00:26:37,379
Hwa Sun... Hwa Sun...

283
00:26:46,288 --> 00:26:47,289
(Come over if you want to see me.)

284
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:48,323
(I'll be waiting.)

285
00:26:48,323 --> 00:26:50,125
(Where Sung Bum proposed to you.)

286
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:51,593
(LOL)

287
00:26:55,631 --> 00:26:59,468
(Hwa Sun)

288
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,115
You can go ahead.

289
00:27:47,115 --> 00:27:48,350
I got a call.

290
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,818
Okay.

291
00:28:07,736 --> 00:28:09,137
Yes, Hwa Sun.

292
00:28:09,137 --> 00:28:11,039
Jung Hwa, I texted you a number.

293
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,041
Locate the caller right now.

294
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:14,443
What?

295
00:28:14,676 --> 00:28:16,678
Soo Yeon contacted me.

296
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:22,551
Don't do this. Leave it to us.

297
00:28:22,551 --> 00:28:23,819
We'll catch her.

298
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:27,055
No. This is something I must do.

299
00:28:27,989 --> 00:28:29,591
Okay, then.

300
00:28:29,891 --> 00:28:32,060
I'll call as soon as I have it.

301
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,462
Thank you.

302
00:28:34,596 --> 00:28:35,997
Hwa Sun.

303
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:37,999
Yes?

304
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:40,268
I know how you feel.

305
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:44,539
So please catch her.

306
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:49,344
(Detective So Jung Hwa)

307
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:04,779
There you are.

308
00:31:05,347 --> 00:31:07,949
Did you think I wouldn't find you if you hid here?

309
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,585
How did you know I was here, Mom?

310
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:12,387
Mom knows everything.

311
00:31:12,387 --> 00:31:15,123
Do you really? How did you know?

312
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,825
- Do you want to know? - Yes.

313
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:19,527
I'm so curious, it's driving me crazy.

314
00:31:22,764 --> 00:31:24,366
It was your smell.

315
00:31:24,366 --> 00:31:27,135
Really? Do I smell?

316
00:31:27,535 --> 00:31:30,238
I wash my hair every morning.

317
00:31:30,238 --> 00:31:33,808
Not a bad smell. A really nice smell.

318
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:36,478
- Really? - Yes.

319
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:39,347
It's the nicest smell in the world.

320
00:31:41,349 --> 00:31:43,018
Did you finish your homework?

321
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:48,256
- 7 times 8 is? - 56.

322
00:31:48,256 --> 00:31:49,391
- 9 times 7. - 63.

323
00:31:49,391 --> 00:31:50,792
2 times 2.

324
00:31:51,393 --> 00:31:52,794
Four.

325
00:31:52,894 --> 00:31:55,363
- Jung Do Yoon. - Then do I get chicken?

326
00:31:55,363 --> 00:31:56,765
Chicken?

327
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,400
Chicken?

328
00:31:59,234 --> 00:32:01,136
- Tada. - Yay!

329
00:32:02,537 --> 00:32:03,939
Are you pleased?

330
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,374
Yes. You're the best.

331
00:32:06,374 --> 00:32:07,909
I'm the best?

332
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:10,045
You're the best too.

333
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:27,429
Gosh. It looks like it'll pour.

334
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:29,364
I guess.

335
00:32:29,497 --> 00:32:30,899
I'm worried.

336
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,936
You live 10 minutes away. Why worry?

337
00:32:34,936 --> 00:32:37,439
Not me. My Ji Hye.

338
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:42,377
What about your wife?

339
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,779
Ji Hye's a scaredy-cat.

340
00:32:44,813 --> 00:32:48,350
She jumps awake at night whenever I fart...

341
00:32:48,683 --> 00:32:51,653
Yes. It must be great to be a newlywed.

342
00:32:51,653 --> 00:32:54,522
Just lovely. It's the best time of your life.

343
00:32:54,956 --> 00:32:57,759
- When is your baby due? - Next Monday.

344
00:32:58,426 --> 00:33:00,795
Then you'll be a dad soon?

345
00:33:00,795 --> 00:33:02,330
A dad?

346
00:33:03,698 --> 00:33:05,100
Are you happy?

347
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:09,104
Your life as you know is over.

348
00:33:09,104 --> 00:33:10,572
Understand?

349
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,375
My gosh. And you're still happy?

350
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:16,011
- My goodness. - Go home, sir.

351
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:17,545
I'll see you. Bye.

352
00:33:17,545 --> 00:33:19,447
Be careful on your way home, sir.

353
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:23,952
- Officer Park. - What? You startled me.

354
00:33:23,952 --> 00:33:26,554
- About the hair salon lady... - The hair salon?

355
00:33:26,554 --> 00:33:28,790
The woman who's married to the guy who picks medicinal herbs.

356
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,291
What about her? Was she abused again?

357
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:31,993
No, not exactly.

358
00:33:31,993 --> 00:33:33,995
But apparently, her husband hasn't come home yet.

359
00:33:33,995 --> 00:33:35,897
He won't answer his phone either.

360
00:33:36,331 --> 00:33:39,534
Well, tell her to wait for a bit.

361
00:33:39,534 --> 00:33:41,269
He's probably playing cards somewhere.

362
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,972
I bet he'll show up drunk tomorrow morning.

363
00:33:43,972 --> 00:33:47,475
- I'll see you. - Okay. Go home safely.

364
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:40,361
- I pray to the skies. - Please.

365
00:35:00,248 --> 00:35:03,618
- My goodness gracious. - What happened?

366
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:06,521
- What just happened? - What happened?

367
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,465
Ma'am.

368
00:35:18,066 --> 00:35:20,935
- Get off me. - What?

369
00:35:21,803 --> 00:35:23,938
I said get off me!

370
00:35:26,441 --> 00:35:28,076
Gosh, I guess the rumours were true.

371
00:35:28,076 --> 00:35:31,146
Her powers are not as strong as they used to be.

372
00:35:31,146 --> 00:35:32,714
Do you think we'll get a refund?

373
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:35,450
Of course. We paid a fortune for this.

374
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,353
If they don't give us a refund, I'll report them for fraud.

375
00:35:38,353 --> 00:35:40,455
Hey, excuse me.

376
00:35:40,455 --> 00:35:43,391
We'll be getting a refund, right?

377
00:35:44,926 --> 00:35:46,828
Listen, ma'am.

378
00:35:46,861 --> 00:35:50,398
I'm a freelancer. I'm a contract worker.

379
00:35:50,498 --> 00:35:54,169
I might not even get paid myself.

380
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:58,139
- My goodness. - What a lousy day.

381
00:35:58,506 --> 00:36:00,909
- My goodness gracious. - What an unlucky day.

382
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,744
- Let's go. - Yes, let's go.

383
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,812
My goodness, seriously.

384
00:36:04,812 --> 00:36:08,116
Gosh, I can't believe this.

385
00:36:14,656 --> 00:36:16,324
Just accept it.

386
00:36:16,524 --> 00:36:20,128
If you don't, it'll kill both you and your mother.

387
00:36:39,347 --> 00:36:40,915
Come in.

388
00:36:41,015 --> 00:36:43,451
The shaman is waiting for you.

389
00:36:57,765 --> 00:36:59,567
Promise me.

390
00:37:01,402 --> 00:37:03,905
If I agree to accept you,

391
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:08,209
promise me that you'll make me the strongest shaman.

392
00:37:10,044 --> 00:37:13,715
So that no one will ever be able to look down on me.

393
00:37:22,357 --> 00:37:24,659
You promised to protect me.

394
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,564
You promised to protect me forever!

395
00:38:17,412 --> 00:38:20,515
I'll gouge your eyes out.

396
00:38:20,848 --> 00:38:25,320
I'll gouge your eyes out. That's what I'll do.

397
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,912
We're seeing unusual explosions caused by the sunspots.

398
00:38:51,112 --> 00:38:52,547
When the sunspots explode,

399
00:38:52,547 --> 00:38:54,949
it could cause communication disruptions...

400
00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:58,152
and GPS signal errors on Earth.

401
00:38:58,653 --> 00:39:02,557
And high energy particles could cause damage...

402
00:39:02,557 --> 00:39:06,761
to the solar panels on satellites and the power system on Earth.

403
00:39:06,894 --> 00:39:09,564
It could cause blackouts and also paralyse...

404
00:39:09,564 --> 00:39:12,266
all communications and bank systems on Earth.

405
00:39:20,241 --> 00:39:21,576
There's been a hit-and-run accident at Muji Intersection.

406
00:39:21,576 --> 00:39:24,078
The suspect is on the run. We need backup at the cathedral.

407
00:39:24,078 --> 00:39:25,413
There's been a hit-and-run accident at Muji Intersection.

408
00:39:25,413 --> 00:39:28,349
The suspect is on the run. We need backup at the cathedral.

409
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:31,219
They'll never get the suspect.

410
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:33,254
They should try chasing towards the post office.

411
00:41:02,443 --> 00:41:05,847
(Hwa Sun)

412
00:41:09,283 --> 00:41:13,254
(Hwa Sun)

413
00:41:16,457 --> 00:41:20,628
(Morgue)

414
00:42:12,713 --> 00:42:15,182
(Detective So Jung Hwa)

415
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,821
- Hey. - Yes, Hwa Sun.

416
00:42:20,821 --> 00:42:22,657
I found the cell phone owner.

417
00:42:22,657 --> 00:42:23,925
Where is she?

418
00:42:23,925 --> 00:42:26,994
But the thing is, it's not her cell phone.

419
00:42:26,994 --> 00:42:29,096
The name of the owner is Kim Bo Eun.

420
00:42:29,096 --> 00:42:30,398
Kim Bo Eun?

421
00:42:30,398 --> 00:42:33,434
Yes, she's a nurse at Muji Hospital.

422
00:42:44,412 --> 00:42:45,580
Answer your phone.

423
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,583
I don't want to. I'm off duty today.

424
00:42:48,616 --> 00:42:51,619
Come on. You'll get in trouble with Officer Park.

425
00:42:54,088 --> 00:42:55,556
Hello?

426
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,592
What?

427
00:42:57,725 --> 00:43:00,261
Yes. I'll be right there.

428
00:43:04,065 --> 00:43:05,266
What's wrong?

429
00:43:05,266 --> 00:43:07,368
What? Well...

430
00:43:07,868 --> 00:43:09,604
Something bad happened.

431
00:43:09,737 --> 00:43:11,672
In this small town?

432
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:12,873
I can't tell you.

433
00:43:12,873 --> 00:43:15,610
Stress is bad for the baby.

434
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:17,612
See you later.

435
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,988
Daddy is leaving. See you.

436
00:43:26,988 --> 00:43:28,389
See you.

437
00:43:28,656 --> 00:43:30,257
Have a nice day.

438
00:43:33,561 --> 00:43:35,663
Look at this crowd.

439
00:43:35,663 --> 00:43:38,432
There's nothing to see! Leave.

440
00:43:38,432 --> 00:43:40,534
Hey, you can't take pictures.

441
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:42,470
- Hey, take a picture. - Please leave.

442
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:45,106
I said, leave. What are you all doing here?

443
00:43:46,574 --> 00:43:48,643
Hello, Chief. This is Park Soon Il speaking.

444
00:43:48,643 --> 00:43:51,746
Yes, there's one victim. A woman and a man...

445
00:43:51,746 --> 00:43:53,314
Yes, forensics arrived.

446
00:43:53,314 --> 00:43:55,716
Yes. Okay.

447
00:43:56,117 --> 00:43:58,953
- I see. Yes. - Excuse me.

448
00:43:58,953 --> 00:44:03,024
(Police)

449
00:44:08,029 --> 00:44:10,064
Have you found her eyes yet?

450
00:44:10,097 --> 00:44:11,599
No. Not yet.

451
00:44:25,613 --> 00:44:28,215
- Yes. Okay. - My goodness.

452
00:44:28,215 --> 00:44:30,384
I will. Okay. I understand.

453
00:44:30,384 --> 00:44:32,753
Yes, sir.

454
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,321
Hey, it's getting on my pants.

455
00:44:35,523 --> 00:44:37,425
Gosh, it got on my pants.

456
00:44:39,326 --> 00:44:40,861
I'm sorry.

457
00:44:41,796 --> 00:44:44,865
Officer Cho. Pull yourself together.

458
00:44:44,865 --> 00:44:46,467
You're a police officer.

459
00:44:48,235 --> 00:44:52,406
Officer Park. Why do you think he gouged out his wife's eyes?

460
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,607
How should I know?

461
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,943
Maybe he couldn't stand the sight of her.

462
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,344
What?

463
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,583
You don't have to understand. You just got married.

464
00:45:13,694 --> 00:45:16,530
If we fail to make money again today, I'll quit.

465
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,166
We're late because you had to poop.

466
00:45:19,366 --> 00:45:21,469
I had an upset stomach. What could I do?

467
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:23,437
How can you be so cold?

468
00:45:23,437 --> 00:45:25,840
You're talkative today, Young Sik.

469
00:45:31,245 --> 00:45:32,646
What's that?

470
00:45:33,247 --> 00:45:36,050
Are you catching boars for Joon Seok for chump change again?

471
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:39,120
Goodness, that's embarrassing. Stop doing this.

472
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,755
I have to do this to be able to pay you.

473
00:45:40,755 --> 00:45:42,857
- You don't want to get paid? - I want to.

474
00:45:44,225 --> 00:45:45,793
Everything you say is right.

475
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:47,595
Who cares as long as you can make money?

476
00:45:47,595 --> 00:45:50,064
Go ahead and catch all the boars...

477
00:45:50,064 --> 00:45:51,599
before they ruin the crops.

478
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:52,666
Hold on.

479
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,835
(Taehan Towing)

480
00:45:55,136 --> 00:45:56,904
It should be around here.

481
00:45:56,904 --> 00:45:58,172
Let's go look for it.

482
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,841
A car broke down in the mountains?

483
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,777
We're not in the position to be picky.

484
00:46:14,054 --> 00:46:17,358
- What's wrong? - My stomach hurts again.

485
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:20,027
Gosh, it's coming out.

486
00:46:23,597 --> 00:46:25,599
I really should fire him.

487
00:46:27,134 --> 00:46:28,536
Hello?

488
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:30,271
Yes, it's the tow truck driver.

489
00:46:30,271 --> 00:46:32,239
I think we're almost there...

490
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:33,641
Hello?

491
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,442
Hello?

492
00:46:39,146 --> 00:46:40,548
What the heck?

493
00:46:41,582 --> 00:46:44,185
Goodness, this day just keeps getting better and better.

494
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,636
What's this?

495
00:47:05,372 --> 00:47:07,908
What could this be? A meteorite?

496
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,749
Young Sik. Are you done?

497
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,720
Hurry up before you get gored by a boar.

498
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:31,031
Hey.

499
00:47:32,566 --> 00:47:34,602
Your pants aren't even down.

500
00:47:34,869 --> 00:47:36,537
Did you poop your pants?

501
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:42,009
Hey.

502
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:44,511
It's fine.

503
00:47:51,552 --> 00:47:52,953
Tae Han.

504
00:47:55,256 --> 00:47:57,091
Help me.

505
00:47:58,425 --> 00:47:59,827
Hey.

506
00:48:01,228 --> 00:48:03,998
What's wrong with your eyes?

507
00:48:09,036 --> 00:48:10,771
Stay away!

508
00:48:11,171 --> 00:48:13,607
I said, stay away!

509
00:48:14,174 --> 00:48:15,643
Who are you talking to?

510
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,144
Go away!

511
00:48:19,346 --> 00:48:20,748
Hey.

512
00:48:20,848 --> 00:48:22,650
- Go away! - Are you out of your mind?

513
00:48:27,087 --> 00:48:29,290
Young Sik.

514
00:48:34,395 --> 00:48:35,796
Are you okay?

515
00:48:36,063 --> 00:48:37,131
Young Sik.

516
00:48:37,131 --> 00:48:38,666
(Muji Hospital)

517
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:40,701
Out of the way!

518
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:44,071
Coming through! Sorry!

519
00:48:44,071 --> 00:48:45,472
(Administration)

520
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,211
Are you Detective Lee Hwa Sun?

521
00:48:51,412 --> 00:48:53,013
You're the one who called me, right?

522
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:55,082
Yes.

523
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:58,218
I'm Detective Lee Hwa Sun.

524
00:48:58,218 --> 00:48:59,620
Well...

525
00:49:00,087 --> 00:49:03,590
You lost your cell phone lately, right?

526
00:49:03,757 --> 00:49:06,026
That's right.

527
00:49:10,931 --> 00:49:12,466
Is this the one?

528
00:49:12,766 --> 00:49:15,202
Wait. Yes, it is.

529
00:49:15,669 --> 00:49:17,237
How did you...

530
00:49:19,573 --> 00:49:23,243
Do you remember when you lost it?

531
00:49:23,344 --> 00:49:25,379
Well...

532
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:29,049
I think it was about a week ago.

533
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:31,485
I was getting off work,

534
00:49:31,485 --> 00:49:33,721
and a woman asked me if she could borrow my phone,

535
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,489
so I lent it to her.

536
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:39,660
I'm really sorry, but could I borrow your phone for one second?

537
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:42,663
I forgot mine.

538
00:49:42,696 --> 00:49:45,165
Well, okay.

539
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,501
Here you go.

540
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,474
Mrs. Kim.

541
00:49:53,474 --> 00:49:54,875
You startled me.

542
00:49:54,875 --> 00:49:56,210
Where are you going?

543
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:58,879
My daughter is a little sick, so I'm leaving early.

544
00:49:58,879 --> 00:49:59,980
Then hurry home.

545
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,249
- I'll get going. - See you.

546
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,254
What?

547
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:10,591
While I was talking to another nurse,

548
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:12,393
the woman disappeared with my phone.

549
00:50:19,166 --> 00:50:21,668
Was it this woman?

550
00:50:22,169 --> 00:50:23,570
Well...

551
00:50:24,972 --> 00:50:26,440
I'm not sure.

552
00:50:27,041 --> 00:50:30,077
She did have long, straight hair.

553
00:50:31,178 --> 00:50:34,415
My daughter was sick that day.

554
00:50:34,415 --> 00:50:37,084
I was hurrying home and was a bit distracted.

555
00:50:41,822 --> 00:50:44,391
- Coming through! - Out of the way!

556
00:50:44,491 --> 00:50:46,660
- Coming through! - Coming through!

557
00:50:56,203 --> 00:50:58,939
- Sir, can you hear me? - Let go of me.

558
00:50:58,939 --> 00:51:00,074
His temperature is 43°C.

559
00:51:00,074 --> 00:51:01,742
- Let go of me. - Calm down, sir.

560
00:51:01,742 --> 00:51:02,743
What happened?

561
00:51:02,743 --> 00:51:05,679
He must've eaten something bad in the mountains. He suddenly...

562
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:09,450
Sir, let me put a respirator on you.

563
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:11,351
Stay away.

564
00:51:11,351 --> 00:51:12,820
- Sir. Nurse! - I said, stay away.

565
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:13,954
Stay away.

566
00:51:13,954 --> 00:51:15,489
He's hallucinating and having a seizure.

567
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,590
Call the neurosurgeon.

568
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:17,991
Yes.

569
00:51:27,034 --> 00:51:30,270
Father. It's all my fault.

570
00:51:30,304 --> 00:51:32,072
Please don't hit me.

571
00:51:32,072 --> 00:51:33,674
Father, please don't hit me.

572
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:35,576
Don't hit me!

573
00:51:36,143 --> 00:51:37,911
Hey. Calm down. What's wrong?

574
00:51:37,911 --> 00:51:39,780
Tae Han, my father is here.

575
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:42,049
Your father passed away long ago. Pull yourself together.

576
00:51:42,049 --> 00:51:43,817
My father...

577
00:51:43,817 --> 00:51:45,919
Nurse!

578
00:51:47,888 --> 00:51:49,123
Hey!

579
00:51:49,123 --> 00:51:50,524
Are you okay?

580
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:53,026
Go away!

581
00:51:53,627 --> 00:51:55,796
Can I check the CCTV footage?

582
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:57,831
Well...

583
00:51:58,132 --> 00:52:01,268
The cameras here were broken and are being fixed right now.

584
00:52:01,268 --> 00:52:03,403
Father.

585
00:52:05,305 --> 00:52:06,807
Father.

586
00:52:06,807 --> 00:52:08,275
Stop him!

587
00:52:13,013 --> 00:52:14,715
Don't hit me.

588
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:16,617
Don't hit me, Father!

589
00:52:16,617 --> 00:52:18,652
Call the police.

590
00:52:21,255 --> 00:52:24,258
- Don't come closer! Stay away! - What's wrong?

591
00:52:32,299 --> 00:52:34,668
Honey. What just happened?

592
00:52:34,668 --> 00:52:37,571
No... What now?

593
00:52:46,647 --> 00:52:48,182
Don't come closer.

594
00:52:50,717 --> 00:52:52,786
Don't come closer.

595
00:52:53,687 --> 00:52:56,890
Don't. Don't come any closer.

596
00:52:57,925 --> 00:53:00,460
Why did you suddenly jump into the road?

597
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,563
Don't come closer.

598
00:53:03,564 --> 00:53:05,132
Are you hurt?

599
00:53:08,402 --> 00:53:09,937
Hey!

600
00:53:20,981 --> 00:53:23,984
- Tell him to stay away. - What is wrong with you?

601
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,089
- Are you okay? - Don't come closer.

602
00:53:29,089 --> 00:53:31,325
- Young Sik. Hey! - What happened to him?

603
00:53:31,325 --> 00:53:33,360
- What happened? - Young Sik!

604
00:53:35,095 --> 00:53:36,563
My gosh.

605
00:53:36,563 --> 00:53:38,665
He looked badly hurt.

606
00:53:39,166 --> 00:53:41,068
- How come? - He just ran off.

607
00:53:41,068 --> 00:53:42,769
Did you see that?

608
00:53:49,576 --> 00:53:51,311
Tell me.

609
00:53:51,912 --> 00:53:54,514
What did I do so wrong?

610
00:53:55,916 --> 00:53:58,952
I became your follower so you wouldn't kill my mom.

611
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,890
You tormented me so much.

612
00:54:04,224 --> 00:54:06,260
So why do this now?

613
00:54:07,728 --> 00:54:10,130
Why did you abandon me?

614
00:54:12,065 --> 00:54:14,034
Tell me.

615
00:54:15,469 --> 00:54:18,071
Tell me something!

616
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,875
Young Sik!

617
00:54:57,144 --> 00:54:58,945
Nam Young Sik!

618
00:54:59,946 --> 00:55:01,748
Darn you.

619
00:55:35,716 --> 00:55:39,353
Some lunatic jumped right in front of our truck.

620
00:55:39,353 --> 00:55:42,823
He shoved my husband against the truck and ran off!

621
00:55:43,323 --> 00:55:45,692
I think it's the guy the hospital reported.

622
00:55:45,692 --> 00:55:47,327
Which way did the lunatic go?

623
00:55:47,327 --> 00:55:48,729
To the mountains.

624
00:55:48,729 --> 00:55:49,996
- To the mountains? - Yes.

625
00:55:49,996 --> 00:55:52,432
Shoot. Why go... Thank you.

626
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:55,135
- Get in the car quick. - Okay.

627
00:55:55,369 --> 00:55:57,270
No, I'll drive!

628
00:57:56,923 --> 00:57:58,458
Excuse me.

629
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:11,037
Don't you want to kill her?

630
00:58:11,371 --> 00:58:13,039
Get revenge.

631
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:20,480
Kill her. Kill her right now.

632
00:58:22,015 --> 00:58:24,684
Why hesitate? Shoot.

633
00:58:25,485 --> 00:58:28,021
She killed your husband.

634
00:58:31,191 --> 00:58:32,792
Lee Soo Yeon.

635
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:40,934
Lee Soo Yeon.

636
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:49,476
Why did you do it?

637
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,857
Why did you kill him?

638
00:59:07,861 --> 00:59:10,497
(Special thanks to Ahn Eun Jin.)

639
00:59:28,081 --> 00:59:30,517
(Dark Hole)

640
00:59:30,517 --> 00:59:33,787
Do not be afraid. You were chosen by him.

641
00:59:33,787 --> 00:59:35,422
You will meet him soon.

642
00:59:35,422 --> 00:59:37,090
What did you see in the hole?

643
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:39,659
My friend's eyes turned black like yours and he went weird.

644
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,795
I saw the serial killer who murdered my husband.

645
00:59:41,795 --> 00:59:42,862
Lee Soo Yeon!

646
00:59:42,862 --> 00:59:46,333
Black eyes and black blood. They're not human.

647
00:59:51,605 --> 00:59:53,239
Get in, now!

648
00:59:53,239 --> 00:59:54,541
Mom!

649
00:59:54,541 --> 00:59:56,042
Hwa Sun.
