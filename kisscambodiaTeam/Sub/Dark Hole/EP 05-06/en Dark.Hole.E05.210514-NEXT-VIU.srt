(All characters, organizations, places, and events are fictional.)

2
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,466
(Director's Office)

3
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,850
Don't stand there...

4
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:33,045
like a thief and just come in.

5
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,695
Mr. Choi. Take a seat.

6
00:00:53,801 --> 00:00:56,136
Do you know what this is, Mr. Choi?

7
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,636
It's a pistol.

8
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,835
It's not just a pistol.

9
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,546
It's a badge of honor.

10
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,119
It was a gift from the President himself...

11
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,915
for serving my country for my whole life.

12
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:17,756
Do you know how many people suffered because of that pistol?

13
00:01:20,531 --> 00:01:21,725
They suffered?

14
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:25,396
If I hadn't captured those traitors,

15
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,605
the great world we live in right now wouldn't exist.

16
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:32,840
Don't justify what you did.

17
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:35,605
The age of using power to suppress others is over.

18
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:40,316
Listen carefully to what I say.

19
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:43,646
As long as I have this badge of honor,

20
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,225
on this campus, my word is law and justice.

21
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,635
(Dark Hole)

22
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:05,640
It's Lee Soo Yeon. She's back.

23
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:08,945
I need to check for myself if Soo Yeon's really back.

24
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,879
Even my husband died. How do you expect me to ignore this?

25
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,819
What could this be? A meteorite?

26
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,686
- What's wrong with your eyes? - Stay away!

27
00:02:17,591 --> 00:02:19,586
I'll gouge your eyes out.

28
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:26,099
What did you see in the hole?

29
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,900
My friend's eyes turned black like yours and he went weird.

30
00:02:28,901 --> 00:02:30,229
You must know something.

31
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,430
Why did you do it?

32
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:32,741
I see things out of the blue.

33
00:02:32,741 --> 00:02:33,771
Lee Soo Yeon.

34
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:35,770
I saw the serial killer who murdered my husband.

35
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:36,970
Hey, Han Dong Rim!

36
00:02:36,971 --> 00:02:38,605
Do you know what a sinkhole is?

37
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,235
What are you doing?

38
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,545
What's that?

39
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:48,675
Is there something going on outside?

40
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:52,786
I'll gouge your eyes out.

41
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:55,289
Please help me.

42
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,359
I think something happened to my daughter.

43
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,955
That woman also had black eyes just like him.

44
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,096
Do Yoon. Do Yoon! Jung Do Yoon!

45
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:06,001
- Mom! - Go! Now!

46
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:07,466
Mom!

47
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:13,506
- Young Sik. - Are you going to beat me again?

48
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,449
If you hear this, come to Muji High School.

49
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,145
We have a shelter.

50
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,720
If you hear this, come to Muji High School.

51
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:27,156
Let's hurry up and go inside.

52
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:32,425
What could the sound that only you heard be?

53
00:03:32,661 --> 00:03:34,229
I don't know anything for sure yet,

54
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,770
but considering how the mutants suddenly stopped attacking,

55
00:03:36,771 --> 00:03:38,966
I think they're being controlled by something.

56
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,810
Hello? Please open the door!

57
00:03:42,811 --> 00:03:46,536
Where's the woman? That woman inhaled black smoke too.

58
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,346
What if they're all infected?

59
00:03:49,911 --> 00:03:51,009
Stop pretending to be tough.

60
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,680
I can see how terrified you are.

61
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:56,289
- Wait. - Isn't that your wife?

62
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,590
How do we get up there?

63
00:03:57,591 --> 00:03:59,160
That ward was closed.

64
00:03:59,161 --> 00:04:01,490
It's surrounded by mutants. It's too dangerous.

65
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,830
I'll lead the way.

66
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,855
You guys protect the lady.

67
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,930
Do we have first-aid supplies?

68
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:14,466
To treat this wound, we need to get supplies from the nurse's office.

69
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,109
I have a plan.

70
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,705
You can reach the nurse's office and avoid the mutants.

71
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:21,835
(Episode 5)

72
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,075
Hey.

73
00:04:25,011 --> 00:04:26,280
Can you hear me?

74
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:28,476
What was that? Where did that come from?

75
00:04:30,391 --> 00:04:31,585
It's not mine.

76
00:04:31,821 --> 00:04:33,015
Hey, Detective.

77
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:35,429
You might not believe me,

78
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,256
but I saw something amid the smoke.

79
00:04:37,761 --> 00:04:40,126
There might be more to this than just the black smoke.

80
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,895
What do you mean there might be more?

81
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:49,765
I think there's something else inside the black smoke.

82
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:05,246
Be careful.

83
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:09,885
Detective. Detective.

84
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,655
Who's the detective? Who are you talking to?

85
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:14,856
She's a detective from Seoul.

86
00:05:16,071 --> 00:05:19,366
She thinks there's something else inside the black smoke.

87
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,765
What does that mean?

88
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:44,426
It's all ready.

89
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,876
I'll be right back. Wait here.

90
00:06:02,651 --> 00:06:03,746
Hwa Sun.

91
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,575
My name is Do Yoon. I'm eight years old.

92
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:10,285
I'm in class 1-4 at Gaehwa Elementary School.

93
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:13,556
You're coming back, right?

94
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:19,356
Yes.

95
00:06:20,131 --> 00:06:23,796
I promise I'll be back, so wait here, okay?

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,095
Okay.

97
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,070
You really shouldn't have done so many demonstrations...

98
00:07:02,071 --> 00:07:03,965
back when you were young.

99
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:13,080
You know The Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, right?

100
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:15,520
If you're able to recite that without getting anything wrong,

101
00:07:15,521 --> 00:07:16,986
I'll set you free.

102
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:18,616
What do you say?

103
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,496
I guess you really are a spy.

104
00:07:27,461 --> 00:07:28,556
Listen.

105
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,900
"I pledge allegiance to the national flag of Korea..."

106
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:36,239
"and wish eternal honor to both my country and its people."

107
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,106
"And I solemnly swear..."

108
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,306
"to dedicate my all to stay loyal to my country."

109
00:07:47,021 --> 00:07:48,176
Here.

110
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:51,489
There you go.

111
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,986
This is what you call a patriot.

112
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,825
I guess fate brought us back together.

113
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,905
Doctor.

114
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,345
Are you Kim Ok Boon's guardian?

115
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,145
How's my mother doing?

116
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,345
I'm keeping an eye on her, so don't worry too much.

117
00:08:25,151 --> 00:08:29,085
Doctor, can you let me see her just this once?

118
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,256
Well, the thing is,

119
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:36,429
if we keep opening the doors to the isolation room,

120
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,699
the equal pressure will change,

121
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,435
and that could cause malfunctions with her treatment.

122
00:08:40,501 --> 00:08:43,569
Right now, it's best for the patient to avoid coming in contact...

123
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,665
with people from outside.

124
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:47,236
You understand that, right?

125
00:08:47,741 --> 00:08:48,935
Yes.

126
00:08:49,351 --> 00:08:53,520
Then I'll trust that you'll take good care of her.

127
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:54,616
Of course.

128
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,486
Bye.

129
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,275
Detective.

130
00:10:09,021 --> 00:10:10,626
It's okay now.

131
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:20,240
The black smoke isn't attacking us.

132
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:21,736
It's just watching us.

133
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,805
The black smoke might not be...

134
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,035
the only thing we need to be careful of.

135
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,606
Is there something more?

136
00:10:32,621 --> 00:10:34,976
When the security guard got attacked,

137
00:10:35,651 --> 00:10:37,015
I saw something.

138
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,055
It looked like it had tentacles. It was a different creature.

139
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,555
- What? - You're all very brave.

140
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,226
But we have no time to waste. We need to get going.

141
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:05,006
What do you want?

142
00:11:06,151 --> 00:11:09,120
Ma'am, you remember me right?

143
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:11,385
I'm Bong Ju's mother. I work at Daebak Real Estate Office.

144
00:11:12,491 --> 00:11:15,555
Just go back. It's useless.

145
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,285
What?

146
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:19,496
That person's already dead.

147
00:11:20,101 --> 00:11:21,996
Oh, my goodness.

148
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,299
Goodness, my mom.

149
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,000
My poor mom.

150
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:28,935
Mom.

151
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,866
I meant your husband's dead.

152
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:34,076
What?

153
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,506
Why are you so startled?

154
00:11:35,781 --> 00:11:37,175
He deserved to die.

155
00:11:38,481 --> 00:11:39,576
What...

156
00:11:40,751 --> 00:11:43,915
What are you talking about?

157
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,356
You already knew...

158
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,185
he was cheating on you.

159
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,655
That darn punk.

160
00:11:53,901 --> 00:11:56,799
He put me through so much.

161
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,799
I bought him a foreign brand car...

162
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,640
and brand new golf clubs.

163
00:12:00,641 --> 00:12:02,905
I got him everything he wanted.

164
00:12:03,111 --> 00:12:04,606
But he cheated on me?

165
00:12:05,011 --> 00:12:07,336
That's why it's useless to trust humans.

166
00:12:07,981 --> 00:12:09,446
You just need to trust in him.

167
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,846
Who are you talking about?

168
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,216
Look in there.

169
00:12:18,991 --> 00:12:20,785
He's inside.

170
00:12:28,761 --> 00:12:29,866
Gosh.

171
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,196
Is that shaman really that good?

172
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,870
- Wait a second. - Who is she?

173
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:40,376
He's in there.

174
00:13:05,401 --> 00:13:07,765
- Hello, Doctor. - Hello.

175
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:15,675
I've been meaning to ask you.

176
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,250
Which department are you in?

177
00:13:17,251 --> 00:13:19,679
You're not in the emergency department, are you?

178
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,850
Well, I'd been working in Seoul until recently.

179
00:13:23,851 --> 00:13:26,986
Now I work in the internal medicine department here.

180
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,256
Thank you.

181
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,500
You must've been scared,

182
00:13:33,501 --> 00:13:36,000
but you still decided to stay here.

183
00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:37,496
Sure.

184
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,866
The patients here need us.

185
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:47,405
- Get some rest. - Okay.

186
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,645
(Police)

187
00:14:17,911 --> 00:14:19,905
Hey, what's wrong?

188
00:14:21,141 --> 00:14:23,179
It feels like someone is following us.

189
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,775
Don't be ridiculous. We're the only ones here.

190
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,385
Come along.

191
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,100
- Officer Park, look up there. - Where? Is it the darn mutants?

192
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:48,600
I just saw the black smoke go into that vent.

193
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:49,969
- Really? - Are you sure?

194
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,035
- Hurry up and put on your gas mask. - I'm sure.

195
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:54,476
I saw it clearly.

196
00:15:00,851 --> 00:15:02,020
I'll take a look.

197
00:15:02,021 --> 00:15:04,385
Are you out of your mind? It's too dangerous.

198
00:15:06,491 --> 00:15:08,456
If it really is the black smoke,

199
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:11,285
it must be following us.

200
00:15:14,531 --> 00:15:16,196
- Soon Il. - Yes?

201
00:15:16,771 --> 00:15:17,866
Can you get down on the floor?

202
00:15:18,031 --> 00:15:20,895
- Me? Why? - So I can step on your back.

203
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:24,905
- I have a bad back. - Then you go up and look.

204
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,405
No. I think you should go up and look.

205
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,045
Come on.

206
00:15:37,121 --> 00:15:39,555
Here we go. Gosh.

207
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,685
Down!

208
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,956
What's going on?

209
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,385
The smoke...

210
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:52,555
went back into the vents.

211
00:16:52,861 --> 00:16:55,630
What? How can it possibly move on its own?

212
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:57,326
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

213
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,466
What we heard over the radio earlier must be true.

214
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,269
It could've come in here but probably stopped on purpose.

215
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:06,206
You're not going out there, are you?

216
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,410
I don't think it was trying to attack us.

217
00:17:10,411 --> 00:17:13,080
Then what? Did it just want to scare us?

218
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:14,246
Exactly.

219
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,986
It's trying to scare us. Like in hunting.

220
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,489
This is driving me crazy.

221
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,555
Are you saying the smoke is alive or something?

222
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,080
Let's get something straight.

223
00:17:49,081 --> 00:17:50,290
I'm the leader here.

224
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,590
I'll lead the way. You guys follow me.

225
00:17:52,591 --> 00:17:55,785
(Have you been vaccinated for pneumonia?)

226
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,476
(Administration)

227
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,486
Ma'am.

228
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,315
What?

229
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,290
Can you give me a talisman?

230
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,100
You knew my husband was having an affair,

231
00:18:35,101 --> 00:18:36,730
and you predicted that...

232
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:40,496
the man in the cap would die if he went out, and you were right.

233
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,439
From now on, I'm going to rely on you.

234
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,340
- Please help me too. - Hey, wait.

235
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:50,479
- Stop it. - Be quiet.

236
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,015
- We got here first. - Hold on.

237
00:18:58,091 --> 00:19:00,186
Why are you standing up? It's bad luck.

238
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,085
Pardon?

239
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:04,125
Kneel.

240
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,499
- Yes, ma'am. - Come on.

241
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,855
Ma'am.

242
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:36,456
Ma'am, thank you. Thank you very much.

243
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:38,686
This is a sign that you have been chosen.

244
00:19:38,861 --> 00:19:40,300
Never wash it off.

245
00:19:40,301 --> 00:19:42,825
Of course. I understand.

246
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,736
Thank you.

247
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:56,875
Thank you.

248
00:20:04,591 --> 00:20:06,390
My goodness.

249
00:20:06,391 --> 00:20:08,785
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and...

250
00:20:12,891 --> 00:20:15,929
Lord, I believe in you.

251
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:19,426
Forgive our sins and cleanse us.

252
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,865
Hold on. Wait.

253
00:20:27,611 --> 00:20:31,406
There you go again. I said, don't order me around.

254
00:20:31,411 --> 00:20:33,515
Stop it. Are you a kid?

255
00:20:33,621 --> 00:20:35,845
You should stop, Officer Park.

256
00:20:37,351 --> 00:20:38,820
Go ahead.

257
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:41,285
And watch out for the mutants.

258
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:46,226
(Close the door behind you to maintain the temperature.)

259
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,335
There are mutants!

260
00:20:53,341 --> 00:20:56,466
- Where? - At the end of the corridor.

261
00:21:02,881 --> 00:21:04,506
Let's go in quietly.

262
00:21:04,581 --> 00:21:06,050
Have you lost your mind?

263
00:21:06,051 --> 00:21:07,815
We have no choice.

264
00:22:16,321 --> 00:22:19,045
They turned an abandoned school into this shelter.

265
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,459
I'm glad that the kids like it.

266
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,226
What if they'd grown with the love and care of parents?

267
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:28,855
Then they wouldn't have gotten involved in crime,

268
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,726
and they wouldn't have to live here.

269
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,865
There you go again.

270
00:22:39,911 --> 00:22:41,439
Just look at yourself.

271
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,875
You've turned out so well even without those things.

272
00:22:44,611 --> 00:22:46,875
That's only because I had you by my side.

273
00:22:47,821 --> 00:22:50,315
Like we did for each other,

274
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,815
if we trust and love those kids,

275
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,416
don't you think they can change?

276
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,956
Do you believe that people can change?

277
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,926
Yes, I believe so.

278
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,095
I changed after I met you.

279
00:23:10,411 --> 00:23:12,065
Soo Yeon said that...

280
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:15,706
you and I are her only family now.

281
00:23:17,551 --> 00:23:21,845
I still can't believe that she did such a terrible thing.

282
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,386
I wish that she weren't a murder suspect.

283
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,285
Are you all right?

284
00:23:33,601 --> 00:23:36,355
I'm fine. It's nothing.

285
00:23:45,071 --> 00:23:48,035
(Muji Hospital, 5th floor)

286
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,845
Hey.

287
00:24:05,131 --> 00:24:06,226
She's not here.

288
00:24:06,861 --> 00:24:08,295
Ji Hye's not here.

289
00:24:11,801 --> 00:24:13,896
Security office. Security office.

290
00:24:14,901 --> 00:24:17,540
Come in. Do you not hear me?

291
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:20,179
Darn it. They should be by the monitors.

292
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,540
Where did they go?

293
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:24,946
I think they ran off to escape the mutants.

294
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,875
The negative pressure room?

295
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,249
The negative pressure room?

296
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,156
That's a better place to escape the smoke.

297
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:37,085
It's connected to the emergency exit.

298
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:38,785
Hyun Ho.

299
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,025
Calm down.

300
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:43,825
Let's go.

301
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,365
Wait.

302
00:24:50,841 --> 00:24:51,936
Officer Park?

303
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,605
Officer Park, do you hear me?

304
00:24:58,811 --> 00:25:00,075
Darn it.

305
00:25:07,361 --> 00:25:09,085
Let us in, mister!

306
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:02,779
(There are survivors. Rescue us.)

307
00:26:09,294 --> 00:26:13,389
Will you please get a signal? My back's hurting.

308
00:26:13,794 --> 00:26:14,963
Darn it.

309
00:26:14,964 --> 00:26:16,859
What do you think you're doing?

310
00:26:17,204 --> 00:26:18,898
No, Director Choi.

311
00:26:19,234 --> 00:26:21,769
I have a slipped disc.

312
00:26:23,004 --> 00:26:24,468
A slipped disc?

313
00:26:25,444 --> 00:26:27,412
I have a doctor's note.

314
00:26:27,413 --> 00:26:28,579
Send him outside.

315
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,178
Pardon?

316
00:26:30,313 --> 00:26:32,508
Send away these freeloaders!

317
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:37,049
Are you out of your mind?

318
00:26:37,153 --> 00:26:39,619
Don't talk like that. You're scaring the kids.

319
00:26:40,024 --> 00:26:43,089
If you're the director, shouldn't you act like one?

320
00:26:44,663 --> 00:26:46,758
- My goodness. - It's a gun.

321
00:26:48,234 --> 00:26:51,668
Do you want to leave as well?

322
00:26:54,474 --> 00:26:55,938
Answer me!

323
00:26:57,143 --> 00:27:00,342
Will you leave with these freeloaders...

324
00:27:00,343 --> 00:27:04,609
or will you shut your mouth and do as I say?

325
00:27:05,454 --> 00:27:09,119
No, well... What I meant was...

326
00:27:09,524 --> 00:27:10,849
Is that it?

327
00:27:17,494 --> 00:27:19,862
I'm sorry. I apologize.

328
00:27:19,863 --> 00:27:23,928
I must've lost my mind in the heat of the moment.

329
00:27:23,964 --> 00:27:26,428
I will do everything you say.

330
00:27:27,474 --> 00:27:31,369
This is why, in an emergency situation,

331
00:27:31,573 --> 00:27:33,438
order and control are paramount!

332
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:46,218
Stay with Dong Rim in a safe place.

333
00:27:46,823 --> 00:27:48,793
Once the path to the nurse's office is clear,

334
00:27:48,794 --> 00:27:49,958
I'll come and get you.

335
00:28:06,774 --> 00:28:07,938
I'm over here!

336
00:28:40,813 --> 00:28:42,978
What are you doing? Open the door!

337
00:29:33,863 --> 00:29:34,958
Dong Rim.

338
00:29:37,764 --> 00:29:38,968
Are you okay?

339
00:29:39,474 --> 00:29:40,569
What do you mean?

340
00:29:42,174 --> 00:29:43,269
Well...

341
00:29:44,174 --> 00:29:46,869
The mutants might appear. Are you scared?

342
00:29:47,514 --> 00:29:48,609
No.

343
00:29:49,244 --> 00:29:51,648
I'm more scared of people than the mutants.

344
00:29:55,153 --> 00:29:57,849
Why have you been like this lately?

345
00:29:58,194 --> 00:30:01,019
You didn't talk to me like this.

346
00:30:02,724 --> 00:30:04,458
Do you really not know why?

347
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:11,428
Why...

348
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:14,269
Dong Rim, I...

349
00:30:18,873 --> 00:30:21,408
Why are you alone? Where's the detective?

350
00:30:21,984 --> 00:30:23,139
Can't you tell?

351
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:26,513
I'm alone because the mutants got to her.

352
00:30:26,514 --> 00:30:28,049
Tell the truth. What did you do?

353
00:30:28,424 --> 00:30:30,953
Why? Do you think I killed her?

354
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,723
How could you?

355
00:30:32,724 --> 00:30:35,758
Just hit me. Hit me if you can.

356
00:30:38,934 --> 00:30:41,802
Shoot. You really did hit me.

357
00:30:41,803 --> 00:30:44,203
I shouldn't have listened to someone like you.

358
00:30:44,204 --> 00:30:46,198
What do you mean by that?

359
00:30:46,474 --> 00:30:49,198
I think you and I are just the same.

360
00:30:49,244 --> 00:30:50,339
Are we not?

361
00:30:57,014 --> 00:30:58,109
Han Dong Rim.

362
00:30:58,714 --> 00:30:59,953
What are you doing?

363
00:30:59,954 --> 00:31:03,019
We can't go back emptyhanded if the detective sacrificed herself.

364
00:31:05,794 --> 00:31:07,519
She has lost her mind.

365
00:31:09,063 --> 00:31:11,319
Why aren't you going after her?

Hey, where's the card key?

376
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:48,908
Lady, have you seen the card key?

377
00:34:56,554 --> 00:34:59,249
Don't just sit there and look for the card key.

378
00:35:01,223 --> 00:35:04,889
I need the card key to get on the elevator.

- What... What do you mean? - The card key.

380
00:35:11,134 --> 00:35:13,269
Find it if you don't want to die.

381
00:35:16,174 --> 00:35:20,008
You said your baby's nickname is Wriggly, right?

382
00:35:20,214 --> 00:35:21,373
If you want to stay alive to see your baby,

383
00:35:21,373 --> 00:35:22,639
you'd better find the card key.

384
00:35:25,783 --> 00:35:27,883
I... I don't know where it is.

385

Where did she put it?

386

Hey, where did the others go?

392
00:37:27,274 --> 00:37:30,269

I can't believe this.

The pregnant lady. She's alive.

403
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:12,249
She got on the elevator and went down.

404
00:38:12,754 --> 00:38:16,122
She did it. She's alive. Officer Cho, she's okay.

00:38:16,123 --> 00:38:18,619
She's alive. She's okay.

Do you know...

422
00:42:39,561 --> 00:42:42,156
how long it takes to the nearest highway?

423
00:42:42,991 --> 00:42:44,685
Around 10 minutes by car.

424
00:42:44,991 --> 00:42:46,096
Why?

425
00:42:48,971 --> 00:42:51,125
Rather than hiding in the hospital like this,

426
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:53,736
wouldn't it be safer to get out of Muji completely?

I doubt the other places are any different from here.

429
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,846
Let's get out of here first.

430

432
00:43:14,021 --> 00:43:15,586
Do you think Ji Hye is alive?

433
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:20,895
What if she met mutants down there?

434
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:23,696
I'm sure she's safe.

435
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:27,770
She managed to take an elevator down even in this situation.

436
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:30,466
She's a strong person. Don't worry.

445

Did you order them to break the security cameras?

446

454

00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,256
What building is that?

507
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,265
The gymnasium.

508
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:20,336
The main building's too far for you.

509
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,836
Let's go to the gymnasium.

510
00:53:35,951 --> 00:53:37,776
I'm sorry. I got you in a mess.

511
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,046
Don't say that.

512
00:53:47,561 --> 00:53:49,725
- Drink this. - Thanks.

513
00:54:35,041 --> 00:54:37,265
Darn it!

514
00:55:02,201 --> 00:55:05,825
It's just an emergency measure, but it should help.

515
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,035
Aren't you afraid?

516
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,006
People usually get scared and run off to save themselves.

517
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:22,075
Why wouldn't I be afraid?

518
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,586
How is it?

519
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:34,225
Thanks. It feels much better now.

520
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,265
I know it's hard but hang in there.

521
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:43,466
Our janitor. Will he be okay?

522
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:44,935
The medicine bag...

523
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,906
Your teacher will get it back.

524
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:51,906
So don't worry.

525
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,520
My dad told me that...

526
00:55:55,521 --> 00:55:57,616
human beings are the scariest.

527
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:00,319
I'm scared of the mutants,

528
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,756
but even more so of people like Jin Seok.

529
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:05,486
In a situation like this, he tried to save his own skin.

530
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:10,725
However much the world may change,

531
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:14,035
bad people will eventually pay for what they did.

532
00:56:15,501 --> 00:56:17,406
Do you really think so?

533
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:24,009
My dad died in a hit-and-run accident.

534
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:26,415
But no one suffered the consequences.

535
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,875
In this world,

536
00:56:29,251 --> 00:56:31,546
it's the victims who pay the price.

537
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,075
Why? What is it?

538
00:56:55,181 --> 00:56:57,779
What are you going to check now?

539
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,176
Let's move on.

540
00:56:59,411 --> 00:57:01,515
The punk just never listens.

541
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:09,015
I saw the serial killer who murdered my husband.

542
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,689
She put a white cover over his head...

543
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:14,225
and injected him in the neck.

544
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:24,205
I still can't believe that she did such a terrible thing.

545
00:57:50,601 --> 00:57:53,765
(Isolated Ward)

546
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:59,236
(Restricted Area)

547
00:58:00,541 --> 00:58:02,406
What are you doing here?

548
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:06,105
We need more saline in the ER.

549
00:58:06,721 --> 00:58:07,915
I see.

550
00:58:08,521 --> 00:58:11,486
Did you try the large drawer by the ER desk?

551
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:13,555
No, I didn't.

552
00:58:13,561 --> 00:58:15,785
Look in there. There should be a lot.

553
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:17,160
Okay.

554
00:58:17,161 --> 00:58:19,799
And also...

555
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,359
From now on, without my permission,

556
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,765
do not enter this room.

557
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:27,566
Of course, doctor.

558
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,006
(Isolated Ward)

559
00:58:39,621 --> 00:58:46,386
(Restricted Area)

560
00:59:29,561 --> 00:59:31,765
(All child actors underwent psychological therapy.)

561
00:59:49,251 --> 00:59:51,645
(Dark Hole)

562
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:53,759
Why are you doing this to save strangers?

563
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,189
Pretend your parents or kid were among them.

564
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:57,589
Would you still turn away?

565
00:59:57,590 --> 00:59:59,589
I can't leave when they're still alive.

566
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:01,160
Hey. Are you insane?

567
01:00:01,161 --> 01:00:03,169
Yoo Tae Han doesn't know, does he?

568
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:05,225
That you're the one who got him fired.

569
01:00:07,141 --> 01:00:09,366
Get out! The mutants are here!

570
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:13,406
They got in! This place is overrun!

571
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,645
- Hwa Sun. - Lee Soo Yeon?
