(All characters, organizations, places, and events are fictional.)

2
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:21,298
- Yes. - Yes.

3
00:00:21,299 --> 00:00:23,769
- Director, the last shot. - Okay, then.

4
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,879
Thank you so much, sir.

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,008
- Cheers. - Cheers.

6
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:31,374
- Cheers. - I love you, sir.

7
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,519
Don't worry and just do your jobs.

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,649
- Yes. - We trust in you.

9
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,189
Get in the back, sir. I'll drive.

10
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,318
No, Director. Tonight, I'll drive you.

11
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:43,488
I didn't have that much to drink. It's fine.

12
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:45,159
- Get in. - Yes, sir.

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,395
- Get the door for him. - Oh, right.

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,834
Gosh.

15
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:57,809
I can't believe I'm hitching a ride in your car, Director.

16
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,575
It's my lucky day.

17
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,004
You could let me drive.

18
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,174
(Ms. Na Se Na)

19
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,748
What's the problem, Ms. Na?

20
00:01:10,749 --> 00:01:13,158
I'm calling to see if you got back safely.

21
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:15,784
I'm on my way home right now.

22
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:19,155
I'm sorry for leaving first, sir.

23
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,094
My mother suddenly said she doesn't feel well.

24
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:26,138
If your mother isn't well, you should rush to her.

25
00:01:26,139 --> 00:01:28,764
I'm not that stuffed-up an old man.

26
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:57,124
What was that? Did we just hit a man?

27
00:01:57,669 --> 00:01:59,798
I... I must call for help.

28
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:02,339
What should I dial? What's the number?

29
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,965
- Put that down! - What?

30
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,974
He's already dead.

31
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,474
Do you want to lose everything?

32
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,685
Yes.

33
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,354
If you all keep your mouths shut,

34
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,929
I'll prevent your companies from going bankrupt.

35
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,829
Your lives from now on,

36
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,395
I will pay for everything, okay?

37
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,965
Okay?

38
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,634
Okay.

39
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,269
(Ms. Na Se Na)

40
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,835
Ms. Na, do you get what I'm saying?

41
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,778
If you stay by my side,

42
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:46,175
I will make you...

43
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:48,874
a full-time regular teacher.

44
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:52,485
I can even make you my school's principal, okay?

45
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:10,034
(My daughter)

46
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,104
(Dark Hole)

47
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:17,405
My dad told me that...

48
00:03:17,749 --> 00:03:19,814
human beings are the scariest.

49
00:03:20,779 --> 00:03:22,649
I'm scared of the mutants,

50
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,884
but even more so of people like Jin Seok.

51
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:27,784
In a situation like this, he tried to save his own skin.

52
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,854
However much the world may change,

53
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,294
bad people will eventually pay for what they did.

54
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,564
Do you really think so?

55
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:46,104
My dad died in a hit-and-run accident.

56
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:48,675
But no one suffered the consequences.

57
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:51,245
In this world,

58
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:53,974
it's the victims who pay the price.

59
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,218
(Order, justice, love)

60
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:04,985
"Order, justice, love".

61
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,895
It's all a lie.

62
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:10,294
Isn't it?

63
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,655
Why? What is it?

64
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,388
What are you going to check now?

65
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:39,955
Let's move on.

66
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,155
The punk just never listens.

67
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,775
What about your mom?

68
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:02,515
My mom died when I was in elementary school.

69
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,085
I have no family.

70
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,195
I saw the serial killer who murdered my husband.

71
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:21,838
She put a white cover over his head...

72
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,364
and injected him in the neck.

73
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,244
I still can't believe that she did such a terrible thing.

74
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,875
Detective. Are you all right?

75
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:14,515
(Muji Hospital)

76
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,184
Where did he get to? Why can't I find him?

77
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,465
I knew this would happen.

78
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,969
I posted a complaint that...

79
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,099
we shouldn't accept any more useless immigrants.

80
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,838
- A petition. - It's not "complaint"?

81
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,169
You're so ignorant.

82
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:34,508
Why do you think Madam Kim wants us to find him?

83
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:36,479
He's a lowlife.

84
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,648
She says he got dirty blood on his hands.

85
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,174
Dirty blood?

86
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,018
Are you saying he killed someone?

87
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:44,919
I don't know that much,

88
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,388
but Madam Kim said he's a lowlife who did something very bad.

89
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:51,385
We must catch him and offer him as a sacrifice if we're to live.

90
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:53,755
- Shine the light in every corner. - Okay, let's look.

91
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,529
- Oh, come on. - You idiot.

92
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,864
- It's too dark. - Let's keep looking.

93
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,914
I want to go home, Mom.

94
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:19,145
Why don't you have anything? What did you do, you fool?

95
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,519
You moron!

96
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:22,354
I want to go home.

97
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,395
Who did this?

98
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,895
My goodness.

99
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,635
Darn it.

100
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,575
I want to go home!

101
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:11,294
I don't want to die.

102
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,334
I don't want to die.

103
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,434
I don't want to die.

104
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:26,245
You managed to get everyone to stand on your side.

105
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:28,314
I'm impressed by your charisma.

106
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,845
What's wrong?

107
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,184
Do you also want to live?

108
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,265
Why do you ask? Are you going to help me live?

109
00:09:44,869 --> 00:09:46,895
Not me. Him.

110
00:09:48,869 --> 00:09:51,804
I won't fall for that crazy nonsense.

111
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,174
Should I...

112
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:57,605
just stab you or not?

113
00:09:59,109 --> 00:10:00,275
You tell me.

114
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:11,385
Do you think you can kill me?

115
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:15,054
What do you think you're doing?

116
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,225
You won't ever be able to kill me.

117
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:22,865
You'll be the one seeing blood, not me.

118
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:44,084
(Authorized personnel only)

119
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:50,725
I know you're in here.

120
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,265
It's okay. You can relax.

121
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,434
I'm the security guard here.

122
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,434
I'm trying to protect you.

123
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,179
The guy who came with you...

124
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,704
asked me to fetch you.

125
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,444
Really?

126
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,314
Are you really a good person?

127
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,615
Yes.

128
00:11:15,689 --> 00:11:19,284
I'm a good person.

129
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:21,294
You can relax.

130
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:28,064
My gosh, there he is.

131
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,405
I'm sorry.

132
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,034
I'm so sorry.

133
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:35,235
Bring him to me.

134
00:11:39,619 --> 00:11:41,314
If you want to live,

135
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,284
just do as he tells you.

136
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,174
I saw everything.

137
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:21,515
I know that your hands were once covered in blood.

138
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,064
No... No! He tried to kill me first.

139
00:12:31,369 --> 00:12:32,924
Don't be scared.

140
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,865
I'm only here to give you joy.

141
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,534
(Master key)

142
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:15,434
Nice.

143
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,345
I bet there's nothing here.

144
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:47,034
Our ancestors were right.

145
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,765
A crisis comes with opportunities.

146
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:54,034
Excuse me.

147
00:14:59,849 --> 00:15:01,074
Can I go to the bathroom?

148
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,875
I'm sorry I made you wait.

149
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,885
What was that?

150
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:02,334
Is he not a mutant?

151
00:16:04,849 --> 00:16:05,944
Hey, you...

152
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,485
What... Why...

153
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,454
What was he doing here?

154
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,855
Who is he?

155
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,355
He's just...

156
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,468
Here you go. Eat up.

157
00:16:32,469 --> 00:16:35,005
Ma'am, thank you for cooking.

158
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,409
Are you sure this is okay?

159
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,919
We just need to make sure Director Choi doesn't find out.

160
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,245
You're right. It's not like he'll kill us.

161
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:45,818
Don't get too greedy and end up with an upset stomach.

162
00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:48,054
I won't be able to help you then. You got that?

163
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,755
Eat up before it gets cold.

164
00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:52,885
It won't taste good if it gets cold.

165
00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:55,225
Hey, it's darn good.

166
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:57,424
What? Did you just say "darn"?

167
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,765
Did you just cuss at me?

168
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,835
Grandma, it means it's really delicious.

169
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,004
Oh, really?

170
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,608
Chan and Do Yoon, you should try some too.

171
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:14,345
Here you go.

172
00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:21,754
What do you think? Is it darn good?

173
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,055
Yes, it's darn good.

174
00:18:29,598 --> 00:18:30,792
What's wrong?

175
00:18:30,967 --> 00:18:34,767
I think I just heard something.

176
00:18:34,768 --> 00:18:36,837
Is it that darn old man again?

177
00:18:36,838 --> 00:18:38,007
You mean Director Choi?

178
00:18:38,008 --> 00:18:40,847
Yes. I don't care if he's a director or a nobody.

179
00:18:40,848 --> 00:18:43,173
That little jerk just can't shut his mouth.

180
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:45,512
You sure have the mouth of a sailor.

181
00:18:46,177 --> 00:18:48,982
You'd better eat up before I swear at you.

182
00:18:50,258 --> 00:18:53,456
Ma'am, you should start a pancake restaurant someday.

183
00:18:53,457 --> 00:18:54,982
I'll invest.

184
00:18:55,687 --> 00:18:56,853
Me too.

185
00:18:57,098 --> 00:19:00,267
You're still wet behind the ears. You can't have any money.

186
00:19:00,268 --> 00:19:02,527
I'll get a job.

187
00:19:02,528 --> 00:19:04,292
I'm an amazing waitress.

188
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:11,703
Do Yoon, you don't like the pancakes?

189
00:19:11,808 --> 00:19:14,643
- I do. - Then why aren't you eating?

190
00:19:14,848 --> 00:19:16,742
I'm saving them for the detective.

191
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:19,517
Don't worry.

192
00:19:19,518 --> 00:19:22,216
I've put some aside...

193
00:19:22,217 --> 00:19:24,583
for those who went to get the medicine.

194
00:19:28,788 --> 00:19:31,353
Hey, why are you crying?

195
00:19:31,858 --> 00:19:35,693
My mom used to love pancakes. Especially kimchi pancakes.

196
00:19:37,238 --> 00:19:39,292
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

197
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,203
Why are you crying too?

198
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:43,873
Don't worry, guys.

199
00:19:43,937 --> 00:19:46,333
I'm sure they're all doing fine.

200
00:19:47,078 --> 00:19:50,007
Stay strong and eat well...

201
00:19:50,008 --> 00:19:53,242
so you can meet your parents again. Do you understand?

202
00:19:56,217 --> 00:19:58,153
It looks like you're all having fun.

203
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:02,953
Where's everyone else? Why did you come back alone?

204
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:05,752
What? Do you want to die too?

205
00:20:05,957 --> 00:20:09,322
Hey. Watch your mouth.

206
00:20:15,338 --> 00:20:18,173
Mind your own business.

207
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:26,012
- Where's the medicine bag? - You're still alive?

208
00:20:26,177 --> 00:20:29,547
The janitor might die because of you.

209
00:20:29,548 --> 00:20:32,312
He's going to die anyway. What's the use of medicine?

210
00:20:33,758 --> 00:20:35,923
He must've stolen the medicine bag.

211
00:20:37,598 --> 00:20:41,363
You little rat. You're dead meat.

212
00:20:42,897 --> 00:20:44,732
Come here.

213
00:20:48,268 --> 00:20:49,732
Are you okay?

214
00:20:55,808 --> 00:20:58,017
Put that down. I said, put that down!

215
00:20:58,018 --> 00:20:59,916
He's acting like a mutant.

216
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:03,613
Shut it! I'm not a mutant. I'm not!

217
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,926
Go away. Don't come near me.

218
00:21:12,927 --> 00:21:14,522
I said, don't come near me!

219
00:21:21,437 --> 00:21:24,833
What's with that punk? Has he lost his mind?

220
00:21:25,608 --> 00:21:27,347
My goodness.

221
00:21:27,348 --> 00:21:29,173
(Searching for Creativity)

222
00:21:40,387 --> 00:21:41,782
Darn it.

223
00:22:02,808 --> 00:22:04,613
You want to kill them all, don't you?

224
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:07,843
What?

225
00:22:09,048 --> 00:22:10,512
Who are you?

226
00:22:10,988 --> 00:22:12,683
What on earth are you?

227
00:22:13,157 --> 00:22:15,386
Didn't you see the disdain in their eyes?

228
00:22:15,387 --> 00:22:17,052
What are you trying to do?

229
00:22:17,828 --> 00:22:20,353
They're just a bunch of vermin anyway.

230
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:22,623
Kill them all.

231
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:26,537
Who are you?

232
00:22:26,538 --> 00:22:29,502
Come out. Come out, you bastard!

233
00:22:31,377 --> 00:22:34,507
Don't you want to make people fear you?

234
00:22:34,508 --> 00:22:35,673
What?

235
00:22:35,877 --> 00:22:37,876
Make them scared of you.

236
00:22:37,877 --> 00:22:40,042
Isn't that what you want?

237
00:22:42,947 --> 00:22:44,613
I can help you.

238
00:22:44,858 --> 00:22:47,623
Let them know how intimidating you can be.

239
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:52,822
Kill everyone who has ever looked down on you.

240
00:23:02,137 --> 00:23:05,433
Fine. It's all over now anyway.

241
00:23:06,608 --> 00:23:08,643
They should all just die.

242
00:23:59,998 --> 00:24:03,722
What happened to the detective and the girl then?

243
00:24:04,897 --> 00:24:08,262
We parted near the pedestrian overpass.

244
00:24:08,768 --> 00:24:10,032
Well...

245
00:24:11,778 --> 00:24:14,946
I'm sure they'll get back soon.

246
00:24:14,947 --> 00:24:16,173
Goodness.

247
00:24:17,318 --> 00:24:20,443
Look what happened because of that lunatic.

248
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:30,383
I'll be right back.

249
00:24:47,578 --> 00:24:50,742
Look over there. Is that the smoke?

250
00:24:53,177 --> 00:24:54,643
The mutants are here!

251
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:12,238
Run! The mutants are coming! Run away!

252
00:25:12,238 --> 00:25:14,337
- What? - The mutants are coming!

253
00:25:14,338 --> 00:25:17,032
- Hurry up! - We must stop them!

254
00:25:17,137 --> 00:25:19,232
- Come on! - Hurry up!

255
00:25:23,707 --> 00:25:25,712
Run! The mutants are coming!

256
00:25:37,657 --> 00:25:41,193
The mutants are coming! Hurry up and run!

257
00:25:59,177 --> 00:26:03,017
- Grandma! - You have to run.

258
00:26:03,018 --> 00:26:05,653
- Grandma. - Go on, Chan.

259
00:26:05,657 --> 00:26:10,153
- Grandma! - Chan!

260
00:26:11,758 --> 00:26:14,492
- We have to run. Hurry! - I can't.

261
00:26:14,697 --> 00:26:16,966
- What about my grandma? - Hurry!

262
00:26:16,967 --> 00:26:18,262
Grandma...

263
00:26:20,068 --> 00:26:21,232
Run faster!

264
00:26:25,578 --> 00:26:28,103
We have to run. Come on.

265
00:26:43,488 --> 00:26:45,593
- Chan! - Chan is here.

266
00:26:46,828 --> 00:26:48,693
- Run! - Let's go!

267
00:26:50,028 --> 00:26:51,732
- Hurry up! - Come on!

268
00:27:13,788 --> 00:27:16,722
Who is it? Who's crying?

269
00:27:16,828 --> 00:27:18,423
Let me see, punk.

270
00:27:18,727 --> 00:27:20,762
No! Stop!

271
00:27:25,867 --> 00:27:26,962
Come in.

272
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:29,462
Come on. Hurry.

273
00:27:33,437 --> 00:27:36,047
- Let me in. - Oh, no.

274
00:27:36,048 --> 00:27:38,277
- You can't. - Open the door.

275
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:39,972
- Let her inside! - No.

276
00:27:40,147 --> 00:27:42,183
Save me! Let me in!

Why aren't you stopping the mutants?

281

We have to get out of here.

282
00:28:04,738 --> 00:28:06,673
You useless fool.

283
00:28:06,838 --> 00:28:08,247
No one's running away!

284
00:28:08,248 --> 00:28:09,903
Do you still not get it?

285
00:28:10,947 --> 00:28:12,042
Father.

286
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:16,643
Why are you here?

287
00:28:16,818 --> 00:28:19,812
You didn't show yourself even when your mother died.

288
00:28:20,187 --> 00:28:21,282
Let's talk.

289
00:28:21,988 --> 00:28:24,423
What nonsense do you want to say now?

290
00:28:25,157 --> 00:28:27,123
The physics teacher.

291
00:28:30,768 --> 00:28:33,396
I fired her because she took a bribe from a parent.

292
00:28:33,397 --> 00:28:35,903
Don't lie. I heard from everyone else.

293
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:40,002
You made up some excuse to fire her.

294
00:28:41,377 --> 00:28:42,572
Why?

295
00:28:43,008 --> 00:28:46,373
You can't fire people like that just because you don't like them.

296
00:28:50,018 --> 00:28:52,052
You naive fool.

297
00:28:52,657 --> 00:28:56,353
Do you think a full-time high school teacher position...

298
00:28:56,927 --> 00:28:58,153
is easy to get?

299
00:28:59,498 --> 00:29:02,226
- What? - Do you think you got...

300
00:29:02,227 --> 00:29:03,797
a full-time position...

301
00:29:03,798 --> 00:29:06,193
as soon as you graduated because you're so competent?

302
00:29:06,298 --> 00:29:08,206
You're able to keep your position...

303
00:29:08,207 --> 00:29:10,103
because someone before you left.

304
00:29:11,308 --> 00:29:13,037
Of all the things you accomplished,

305
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:15,373
what do you think you did on your own?

306
00:29:16,748 --> 00:29:18,512
Did you do that for me?

307
00:29:22,687 --> 00:29:24,252
Because of you,

308
00:29:24,887 --> 00:29:28,022
I was causing harm to others without even knowing about it.

309
00:29:33,427 --> 00:29:35,492
Don't be so weak.

310

That's how the world is.

311

313
00:29:43,608 --> 00:29:45,502
It's you that's like that.

314
00:29:52,018 --> 00:29:53,476
Do you still not get it?

315
00:29:53,477 --> 00:29:54,886
This place is done for!

316
00:29:54,887 --> 00:29:55,982
Shut your mouth!

317
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:58,383
I am this school!

318
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:00,413

00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:59,814
Why are you so scared? You're a police officer.

505
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,644
You get scared too easily.

506
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:09,854
What is this place?

507
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:13,825
Officer Park, I thought of something.

508
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:16,635
You know your debt, right?

509
00:46:17,139 --> 00:46:19,604
How about I write off your debt if you do something for me?

510
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:22,874
What? What is it?

511
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,805
Let me just borrow that for a moment.

512
00:46:30,279 --> 00:46:31,644
What do you need the gun for?

513
00:46:32,049 --> 00:46:34,048
Didn't you see earlier?

514
00:46:34,049 --> 00:46:36,854
I never let anyone look down on me.

515
00:46:37,659 --> 00:46:41,225
Especially not Yoo Tae Han and that shaman.

516
00:46:46,029 --> 00:46:50,064
Give me the gun and leave while I'm being nice.

517
00:46:50,469 --> 00:46:52,064
I can't do that.

518
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:55,274
If I lend my gun to anyone, I'll lose my job.

519
00:47:01,049 --> 00:47:03,374
Tae Han doesn't know, right?

520
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:05,814
That he got dismissed from the force because of you.

521
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:19,765
Welcome, Officer Park.

522
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,899
Officer Park, why are you so surprised?

523
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,068
Is there a problem?

524
00:47:27,069 --> 00:47:30,008
What are you talking about? I'm not surprised.

525
00:47:30,009 --> 00:47:34,644
Aren't you feeling well? Why are you sweating so much?

526
00:47:34,909 --> 00:47:37,749
I'm wearing thermals.

527
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,945
You know, those extra warm ones.

528
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:45,584
Come have a drink with us.

529
00:47:45,589 --> 00:47:47,559
We have some food too.

530
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:51,499
Hey, chop up some intestines for Officer Park.

531
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,595
Yes, sir.

532
00:47:53,799 --> 00:47:55,698
- Come here. - No, thanks.

533
00:47:55,699 --> 00:47:59,265
No, I'm really fine. I just ate.

534
00:47:59,469 --> 00:48:00,564
I had intestine soup.

535
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,250
Gosh.

536
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:10,679
How can you be joking around...

537
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:12,745
when you still owe me?

538
00:48:12,989 --> 00:48:16,814
You see, can you wait for just another month?

539
00:48:16,889 --> 00:48:21,488
Goodness. You shouldn't have been so greedy.

540
00:48:21,489 --> 00:48:24,428
Why did you have to gamble with borrowed money?

541
00:48:24,429 --> 00:48:26,765
Look at all the trouble you've caused.

542
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:31,138
Should I just report you right now?

543
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:33,309
Is the number 112 or 114?

544
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:34,669
It's 112, sir.

545
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:37,075
Oh, I see.

546
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,715
I'll do whatever you tell me to.

547
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,584
Please let this slide.

548
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:50,454
Officer Park, your showmanship is impressive.

549
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,155
Officer Park.

550
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:59,825
Are you sure you'll do whatever I tell you to?

551
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:04,934
Hey.

552
00:49:08,609 --> 00:49:12,475
I need you to take care of Yoo Tae Han.

553
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:14,604
He's an officer too.

554
00:49:15,279 --> 00:49:17,075
How can I take care of him?

555
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,448
Just make a report...

556
00:49:21,449 --> 00:49:24,285
that he took bribes.

557
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:27,024
I'll take care of the rest.

558

559

"to pay off his gambling debts."

560
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:35,495
It's going to be really interesting,

561
00:49:35,699 --> 00:49:36,794
don't you think?

562
00:49:40,109 --> 00:49:41,805
You can't do this!

563
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,575
No! Please!

564
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,914
Give me the gun!

565
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,615
No!

566
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:12,805
Hey, stay with me.

567
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:15,475
Stay with me.

568
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,535
Please.

569
00:50:18,509 --> 00:50:19,604
Stay with me.

570

Come on.

571
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:29,854
This is bad.

572
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:33,584
Let's go. Come on.

573
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:00,419
Her condition is getting worse.

574
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:02,919
Her vitals are unstable, and the baby isn't doing well.

575
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,888
Doctor, please save Ji Hye.

576
00:51:04,889 --> 00:51:06,528
- Put an oxygen mask on her. - Yes, Doctor.

577
00:51:06,529 --> 00:51:07,624
Let me have a look.

578
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:09,954
I'll do it.

579
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,439
We must hurry up.

580
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,894
Get me some oxytocin.

581
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:18,365
Hurry!

582
00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:21,434
Ji Hye.

583
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:24,635
Hang in there.

584
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:28,104
Ma'am, look at me.

585
00:51:28,279 --> 00:51:31,745
It's okay. Stay with me.

586
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:33,845

Ji Hye.

The uterine contraction is causing the baby's heart rate to drop.

593
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,294
Doctor, please save Ji Hye and our baby.

594

Doctor.

595
00:52:25,969 --> 00:52:28,664
Get as much equipment as you can.

Do Yoon, are you all right? Will you open the door?

610

Put on your masks.
