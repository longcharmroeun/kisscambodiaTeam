14
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,590
Little missy, come with us.

15
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,080
Did you get the wrong person?

16
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,440
You can scram.

17
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,200
Can I beat them up?

18
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,160
Try not to kill them.

19
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,680
I know.

20
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,680
You can kill the guy.

21
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,830
Don't hurt the girl.

22
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,000
Boss Bu Le wants her.

23
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:09,830
Bu Le?!

24
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:10,830
Where is he?

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:13,950
Boss!

26
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,800
Boss!

27
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,000
Where's the girl? Did you get her?

28
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,240
Boss...

29
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,110
That brat's Martial Soul
is the Blue Silver Plant.

30
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,470
He's strong.

31
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,910
So you're Bu Le?

32
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,520
She's even prettier up close.

33
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,720
Break all his limbs and throw him out.

34
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,520
Send the girl to my room.

35
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,910
You're this powerful without Martial Soul.

36
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,550
Are you a Mutant Soul?

37
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,080
If you are,

38
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,030
I can help you.

39
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,600
Like how you helped Nightfire Village?

40
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,630
So you are the one

41
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,390
who took Ma Hong Jun away.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
In that case we can strike a deal.

43
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,670
Give me Ma Hong Jun,

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,240
and I'll give you the right compensation.

45
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,390
With our help,

46
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,440
your Martial Soul

47
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,080
might be able to mutate again.

48
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,270
It'll become even stronger!

49
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:22,790
What deal?

50
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,040
Who is she to you?

51
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,240
She is my sister.

52
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,040
That's great!

53
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,550
Then I can be your brother-in-law!

54
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,400
We'll be family!

55
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,550
Where's the medicine for Nightfire Village?

56
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,120
Hand it over!

57
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,760
I-It's...

58
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,990
It's there, beneath the stack of books.

59
00:03:59,070 --> 00:03:59,910
What's wrong, Wu?

60
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,880
I think I'm fine.

61
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,040
Check her wrist.

62
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,990
If that green line reaches her heart,

63
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,630
she's done for.

64
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,800
You better think this through!

65
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,470
If I die,

66
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,600
she'll die too!

67
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,240
Give me the antidote.

68
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,110
I don't have it!

69
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,750
I... I'll tell you.

70
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,910
Release me... I'm about to die.

71
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:26,870
Release me, release me.

72
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,150
That poison was created by the headquarters.

73
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,870
A minion like me wouldn't have the antidote.

74
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,000
At most, she only has half a month left.

75
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,190
You're going to pay for it

76
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,030
if anything happens to her.

77
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,430
I know... I know where...

78
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,800
you can find people from the headquarters.

79
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,840
Tell me now!

80
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:58,840
Get to

81
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,000
the town near the Star Forest after three days.

82
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,520
Someone from the headquarters will be there.

83
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,720
How do I meet that person?

84
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,910
Get that thing out from the box.

85
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,750
Don't worry, I've used up all the poison.

86
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,280
After three days,

87
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,310
take this letter

88
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
to Star Town.

89
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,720
Someone from the headquarters will find you.

90
00:05:17,896 --> 00:05:19,104
Where's the medicine for Nightfire Village?

91
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,800
I've already distributed them.

92
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,840
I can't have prepared a letter in advance

93
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,720
just to lie to you!

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,120
You're both really going to Star Town?

95
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,080
It's stated here.

96
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,310
Wait on the street

97
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,430
with this letter.

98
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,150
Someone will reach out t you.

99
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,150
Looks like we have to go to Star Town.

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,080
That town is extremely dangerous.

101
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:49,979
The law does not exist there.

102
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,080
I heard that they have people guarding

103
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,080
at the town's entrance recently.

104
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,350
Those guards are the townspeople.

105
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
If it's so dangerous,

106
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,630
why didn't the townspeople leave?

107
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,280
If there's no law, there are no taxes.

108
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,630
Many Soul Masters gather there too.

109
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,430
They can do business.

110
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,800
Plus Star Town

111
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,960
is near Star Forest.

112
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,590
There's always Soul Beasts ambushing people,

113
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,240
making Star Town full of desperadoes.

114
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,190
They kill to rob, and prey on the weak.

115
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,960
No matter how dangerous it is,

116
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,030
I will go there.

117
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,470
Wu is my sister.

118
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,680
I can't just let her die.

119
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,080
But I'm still worried.

120
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,470
How about this?

121
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,750
We'll bring them along.

122
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,430
We'll all go together.

123
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,840
Let's bring that girl
from the Martial Soul Hall too.

124
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,120
Hu Lie Na is smart.

125
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,960
She'll be able to track

126
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,150
Bu Le down sooner or later.

127
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,080
If she finds out,

128
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,630
then the Martial Soul Hall will know too.

129
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,680
That's why we must bring her.

130
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,400
Will she be willing to come with us?

131
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,520
I have a plan.

132
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,840
Plus, we must not tell the other students

133
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,030
that it's for Wu.

134
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:48,720
For me?

135
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,630
That's right.

136
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,350
The school

137
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,800
is organizing a trip to the Star Forest.

138
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,430
We are going to find a Soul Beast

139
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,280
for Ou Si Ke.

140
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,430
For his Soul Rings to advance.

141
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,150
He wants to advance to Triple Soul Rings too?

142
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,310
Is there a problem?

143
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,150
How old is he?

144
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,400
He just advanced to Double Soul Rings.

145
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,190
If he doesn't master his Soul Power first,

146
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,240
he won't be able to advance.

147
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,870
Here, take this.

148
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:12,840
Don't drop it.

149
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,560
It's very expensive.

150
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,430
Use your Soul Power to activate it.

151
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,000
Full Soul Power?

152
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,350
That's impossible.

153
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:27,870
It's probably broken.

154
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,960
Do you really have full Soul Power?

155
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,310
So, no problem, right?

156
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,870
Even if you have full Soul Power,

157
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,960
you should be training often

158
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,000
to boost your Martial Soul

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,150
to the best condition.

160
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,800
Only then could you try to advance.

161
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,400
He already achieved full Soul Power last year.

162
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,430
Since it's been a year,

163
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,870
the timing is just right.

164
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,150
Can I not go?

165
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,840
You cannot.

166
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:53,840
I mean

167
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:54,750
that Star Forest

168
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,400
is where wild Soul Beasts lurk and gather.

169
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,680
Legend says there's even
top-level Soul Beasts in that forest.

170
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,400
What do you mean by that?

171
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,150
You coward, you're scared.

172
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,400
Who's a coward!?

173
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,750
W-who says I'm scared!

174
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,800
Rong Rong.

175
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,350
I... I am fearless.

176
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,120
I'm only afraid...

177
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,910
I'm afraid that you girls will be scared.

178
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,680
You should be careful and

179
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,590
think about what you just said.

180
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,430
Girls from Shi Lan Ke School are the most valiant,

181
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,750
a-and are not weaker than any of us here.

182
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,680
Of course!

183
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,470
Even the girls are going,

184
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,120
and you're not?

185
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:21,910
Dad!

186
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,350
I heard there are two Beast Kings in the forest.

187
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,280
Strongest in the world.

188
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,350
Only the Grand Soul Land Master
with Nine Soul Rings

189
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,590
have a chance against them.

190
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,870
What if we encounter

191
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,120
and can't defeat them?

192
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,150
It's been a while since anyone saw the Beast King.

193
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,470
The Beast King is lurking
in the depths of the forest.

194
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,030
Beast King?

195
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,630
Accurately speaking, it's the king of the forest.

196
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,480
One of them is the Titan Giant Ape.

197
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,400
Then what about the other?

198
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,400
No one has ever seen the other Beast King.

199
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,550
I don't know what that is.

200
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,670
But I've always thought

201
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,430
that it's a flawed statement.

202
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,400
Two Beast Kings in one forest?

203
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,790
How can they live in peace?

204
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,040
Because they're friends.

205
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,960
The Beast Kings are friends?

206
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,670
The second Beast King is the Azure Bull Python.

207
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,040
How did you know?

208
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,110
I... I...

209
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,720
Like Ou Si Ke,

210
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,920
I just heard of it.

211
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,430
Hearsay.

212
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,990
Ou Si Ke, do you have any more questions?

213
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,600
I'm really not suited to become a Soul Master.

214
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,840
Pack up, everyone.

215
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
We'll leave early tomorrow morning.

216
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,110
I still want to be an artist.

217
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,230
In your dreams!

218
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,190
But

219
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,360
doesn't our school emphasize

220
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,310
on letting the students have freedom,

221
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,630
and the option to choose?

222
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,110
Sure, I'll give you two choices.

223
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,720
One,

224
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,310
you'll come with us to the Star Forest.

225
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,312
I'll take the second choice.

226
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,520
That's to burn all your costumes and books.

227
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:40,670
Fine.

228
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,480
Alright, alright.

229
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,750
I'll go pack up.

230
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,230
What's more,

231
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,790
Tomorrow, Tang San and Wu

232
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,230
will go with Master first.

233
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,400
The rest of you, follow me.

234
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,190
We'll meet up at Star Town tomorrow.

235
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Alright, that's all.

236
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,280
I can't believe

237
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,230
that your Soul Power is advancing faster than me.

238
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,840
There are lots of people stronger than you.

239
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,600
You don't have to be so mean to her.

240
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,840
She's not suitable to be in Shi Lan Ke School.

241
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,080
You...

242
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,430
I'm actually not strong at all.

243
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:10,790
I...

244
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,990
I... I'm really weak.

245
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,750
Really, Rong Rong.

246
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,990
I'm really very weak.

247
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,630
Don't worry, I think we can make it.

248
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,110
Don't you worry.

249
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,550
I'll definitely cure you.

250
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,600
I believe you.

251
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,110
Why do we suddenly have to go to the Star Forest?

252
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,190
Wasn't it mentioned just now?

253
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,110
It's to help Ou Si Ke's Soul Rings advance.

254
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,040
Ma Hong Jun is still battling in the arena,

255
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
and Bu Le has yet to appear.

256
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,160
Is it really an urgency to

257
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,160
help with his Soul Rings advance?

258
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,430
Perhaps you've already met Bu Le?

259
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,430
Or you know

260
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,190
that Bu Le will appear at the Star Forest.

261
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,960
Did I guess it right?

262
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,840
Hand Bu Le over.

263
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,960
The Martial Soul Hall will reward you well.

264
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,960
We don't need rewards.

265
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,520
Many people desire to hunt and kill Soul Beasts

266
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,790
for instant success.

267
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,040
They're considered lucky.

268
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,190
There are many Soul Masters that never returned.

269
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,110
Then why do people still go?

270
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,520
Aren't they afraid of death?

271
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,920
Hope can blind your eyes.

272
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,400
Look!

273
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,750
The Fire Flamingo.

274
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,040
Once a Soul Beast dies,

275
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,430
its aura dissipates and returns to the void.

276
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,080
Where did the corpse come from?

277
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,430
Of course it's a fake.

278
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,520
All the so-called ancient weapons,

279
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,840
remains of the Soul Beast,

280
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,790
and the inheritance of the Martial Soul

281
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,310
are just lies.

282
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,230
It looks really real.

283
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,790
Heads down, don't look upfront.

284
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,670
Seven Soul Rings?

285
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,350
Let's go.

286
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,021
Keep your heads down.

287
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:24,840
Follow me.

288
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,520
Let's find an inn to stay the night.

289
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,080
Alright.

290
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,280
We don't have enough funds.

291
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,320
We'll have to make do with this.

292
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,110
It's inconvenient for Wu.

293
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,350
I'll find a screen for you.

294
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,400
We'll sleep on separate beds.

295
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,910
Actually, it's OK.

296
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,520
Master,

297
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,320
I saw it on the street earlier.

298
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,710
How did you get Seven Soul Rings?

299
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,110
What is this?

300
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,350
The Headmaster gave me this.

301
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,710
He said it's a drama prop made by Ou Si Ke.

302
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,000
If necessary, we can use our Soul Power

303
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,400
to generate a

304
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,520
Soul Ring effect that looks real.

305
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,320
Ou Si Ke made this?

306
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,640
He's amazing.

307
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:11,670
Yeah.

308
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,110
It's a pretty good way

309
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,150
to scare people away.

310
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,840
But if we really get into a fight,

311
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,350
does that mean we're screwed?

312
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,080
That's why you should never be alone.

313
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,320
There are all types of people here.

314
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,030
Now you're cute.

315
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,710
Let me see your arm.

316
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,350
Sir.

317
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,710
You showed that you have Seven Soul Rings earlier.

318
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,640
Everyone who saw you

319
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,710
would know you're a Soul Saint.

320
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,000
It will be

321
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,280
inconvenient for you to go out.

322
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,350
Why don't I

323
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,400
bring that letter instead

324
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,470
to wait for that person?

325
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,150
You're right.

326
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,150
Be careful.

327
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,440
I'll be watching from afar.

328
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,230
I should go too.

329
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,590
You see...

330
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,640
If you leave me alone here in the inn...

331
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,590
It's pitiful.

332
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm scared.

333
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,550
You're usually afraid of nothing.

334
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,760
You're scared?

335
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,150
I just want to go with you.

336
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,000
Don't... we look a little silly?

337
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,280
Well...

338
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,550
Why don't you wait for me inside?

339
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,440
I can stand here by myself.

340
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,400
No!

341
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,960
Even if it's silly,

342
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,960
I want to accompany you.

343
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,760
Why are there so many people

344
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,150
here to hunt Soul Beasts?

345
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,440
They are all Soul Masters.

346
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,760
Do you think

347
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,590
humans and Soul Beasts can have a peace talk?

348
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,840
Soul Beasts don't have intelligence.

349
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,110
How can we have a peace talk?

350
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,550
Then if Soul Beasts have intelligence
like humans do,

351
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,790
does that mean we can co-exist in peace?

352
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,350
Probably not.

353
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,520
Why?

354
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,470
What's the point
for a 100,000-year-old Soul Beast

355
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,000
to develop to the human form?

356
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,760
These Soul Masters

357
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,150
will still swarm here

358
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,150
to hunt for them.

359
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,590
So long as Soul Masters

360
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,880
continue to rely on killing Soul Beasts
to advance their Soul Rings,

361
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,030
humans and Soul Beasts

362
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,710
will never be able to co-exist peacefully.

363
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,670
Master has said

364
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,350
that demands will determine the stand.

365
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,350
But there has to be an exception.

366
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,230
Perhaps there will be one or two exceptions,

367
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,760
but there won't be any drastic changes.

368
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,590
Then what if lots of people want to kill me?

369
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,280
Why would lots of people want to kill you?

370
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm just asking what if.

371
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,160
What if one day...

372
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,640
I'll be here to protect you.

373
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,310
If one day

374
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,470
over a million Soul Masters

375
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,430
want to kill me,

376
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,950
I hope that you'll pretend you don't know me.

377
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,160
Protect yourself.

378
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,920
No one

379
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,560
can ever harm you

380
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,590
unless

381
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,520
they trample my dead body.

382
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:12,710
Sir.

383
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,040
The poison in Wu's body is still progressing.

384
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:15,950
Don't lose hope.

385
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,000
Let's wait again tomorrow.

386
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,160
What if he doesn't appear tomorrow either?

387
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,880
If no one appears after three days,

388
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,230
I'll go to the Martial Soul Hall.

389
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,710
What for?

390
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,070
You don't have to know.

391
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,280
I'll have a way.

392
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,230
-Alright.
-Tang San.

393
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,040
Why aren't you sleeping?

394
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,680
I will protect you too.

395
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,590
If one day

396
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,160
over a million Soul Masters

397
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,830
want to kill you,

398
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,760
I will stand with you forever.

399
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,230
Of course.

400
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,760
What's this about?

401
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,000
It's nothing.

402
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,830
Sir, you should rest.

403
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,760
Here you come, bro.

404
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:02,430
Have some water.

405
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,437
What's going on?

406
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,187
Soul Beasts are rushing out of the forest.

407
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,470
Luckily I'm a fast runner.

408
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,470
Otherwise, I'd be dead by now.

409
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:11,880
I'm telling you,

410
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I got really lucky.

411
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,640
A group of students were running to town too,

412
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,640
but a Soul Beast stopped them.

413
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,830
I don't think they'll make it.

414
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:22,830
What students?

415
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,230
How would I know?

416
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,710
What did they look like?

417
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,470
From far,

418
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,729
it seems like one of their
Martial Souls is the White Tiger.

419
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,280
Dai Mu Bai and the others

420
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,146
must have run into trouble.

421
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,437
Both you and Wu go back to the inn.

422
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,310
We want to go too.

423
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,190
Soul Beasts are rushing out.

424
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:43,950
This is a serious matter.

425
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,950
Both of you will be a burden.

426
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,470
Listen to me, wait for me at the inn.

427
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,830
Let's go back to the inn to wait for Master.

428
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,590
Let's go back first.

429
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,560
The elder that was with us earlier

430
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,470
is a Soul Saint with Seven Soul Rings.

431
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,590
We know.

432
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:30,950
We saw.

433
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,040
If we didn't see him leave,

434
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,680
we wouldn't be stopping you on your tracks.

435
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,350
We are just poor students.

436
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,880
We don't have any money.

437
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,400
You don't have money,

438
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,590
but that Soul Saint has.

439
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,640
You're both important to him.

440
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,680
If we take you as hostages,

441
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,400
we'll be sure to get paid a lot.

442
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,800
Our school is very very poor.

443
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Who'd believe you?

444
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,230
She's telling the truth.

445
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,000
Why don't you ask around and find out?

446
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,280
Shi Lan Ke School is famous for being poor.

447
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,070
Men, get them!

448
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,070
Wait.

449
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,950
What school are both of you from?

450
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,190
Shi Lan Ke School.

451
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,230
Shi Lan Ke School in Suo Tuo City.

452
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,310
Did Bu Le send you?

453
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,190
You're the one from headquarters.

454
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,310
Brat!

455
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,520
Stop creating trouble for me.

456
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,230
If you're smart,

457
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,230
get out of here now.

458
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,310
This young brat

459
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,310
is already a Soul Saint with Quadruple Soul Rings?

460
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,590
It's just a bluff.

461
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,400
Useless piece of shit.

462
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,800
You useless brat!

463
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,400
Go to hell!

464
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,430
Why aren't my legs moving?

465
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:11,950
My legs!

466
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:13,680
My legs!

467
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,520
Big Brother!

468
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,920
It's rare to see

469
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,187
the Blue Silver Plant mutates.

470
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,430
You killed them?

471
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,590
It's them who wanted to kill me.

472
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,470
I asked Bu Le to meet me.

473
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,000
Why is it both of you instead?

474
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,880
Poisoned.

475
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,470
Bu Le said you can cure her poison.

476
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,350
Yes, I can cure it.

477
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,230
But why should I cure it?

478
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:15,830
You...

479
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,070
Did both of you come with that Soul Saint?

480
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,880
You knew we were here?

481
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,520
What's your name?

482
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,430
What do you want us to do for the antidote?

483
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,430
I'm asking for your name.

484
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:25,710
Tang San.

485
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,680
I am Ye Zhi Qiu.

486
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,040
Piece of advice for both of you.

487
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,280
Neither the royal family
nor the Martial Soul Hall...

488
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,880
can cure this poison.

489
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:35,800
So...

490
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,160
I am your only hope.

491
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,070
Why?

492
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,350
Do you think you can defeat me?

493
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:44,800
I'll fight you anyway.

494
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,000
If you make any move,

495
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,560
I'll kill her first.

496
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,110
If you want me to cure her,

497
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,470
you'll have to work for me.

498
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,000
Cure her first.

499
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,310
You have no right to bargain with me.

500
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:01,400
Alright.

501
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,190
What do you want me to do?

502
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,350
We're lucky that it wasn't a head-on fight.

503
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,800
It'd be a huge problem if it was.

504
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
It's normal for Soul Beasts to appear

505
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,920
near the Star Forest.

506
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,560
We've finally arrived.

507
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,560
This trip is tiring me out.

508
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,710
Ou Si ke is the one carrying all your things.

509
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,470
Why are you tired?

510
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,160
You...

511
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,160
No no no.

512
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:28,760
Brother Dai.

513
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:29,760
I'm happy to.

514
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,350
This is practice for me.

515
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,310
Practice.

516
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,000
Workout.

517
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,560
What's up with that observer?

518
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,760
She didn't say a word.

519
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:37,680
She...

520
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,040
Perhaps she...

521
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,350
I have no idea at all.

522
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,920
Brother San? Sister Wu?

523
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,800
Didn't I tell them to go back to the inn?

524
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,400
Headmaster, Sir.

525
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,229
What happened?

526
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,680
The one we've been waiting for appeared.

527
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,280
Alright.

528
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,000
Let's talk back at the inn.

529
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:58,710
Alright.

530
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,950
Let's go.

531
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:13,040
Ye Zhi Qiu's Martial Soul has no form

532
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,800
and kills people eerily.

533
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,280
His Martial Soul is really strange.

534
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
We absolutely couldn't see

535
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,830
what form it was.

536
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,950
Do you know anything?

537
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:26,800
Never heard of it.

538
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,160
Even you don't know.

539
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,000
Then that must be a brand new Martial Soul.

540
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,070
Or...

541
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,190
Mutant Soul.

542
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,520
Is this

543
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,400
the mission he gave you?

544
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,070
What are the details?

545
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,230
Tomorrow, there'll be

546
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,400
a Soul Master called Du Gu Yan

547
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,640
heading for Star Forest.

548
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,230
Her objective is to hunt Soul Beasts

549
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,160
to advance to Triple Soul Rings.

550
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,310
Your mission

551
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,760
is to find her,

552
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,830
and break this bottle in front of her.

553
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,350
What do we do next?

554
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,310
There is no next.

555
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,470
You only have to do that.

556
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,680
What does Du Gu Yan look like?

557
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,560
She wears a cherry blossom on her head.

558
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,230
You'll recognize her once you see her.

559
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,560
The Star Forest is vast.

560
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,070
How are we going to find her?

561
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,110
She will choose to hunt for

562
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:18,830
poisonous Soul Beasts.

563
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,760
What's inside this bottle?

564
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:25,880
Didn't he tell you?

565
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:26,800
No.

566
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,280
Two illogical points.

567
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,160
Why is a secret organization that is

568
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,590
widespread across the Douluo continent

569
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,760
targeting someone about
to advance to Triple Soul Rings?

570
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:40,520
Next,

571
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,710
if this is truly an important matter,

572
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,110
why isn't he doing it himself?

573
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,160
Why did he ask both of you to do it?

574
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,520
Perhaps it's because it's really dangerous.

575
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:53,760
That's why he won't do it himself.

576
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:54,830
Either

577
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,400
that he can't appear in front of Du Gu Yan

578
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:57,470
or

579
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,710
that the contents in this bottle

580
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,040
will harm him as well.

581
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,470
Maybe it's the same poison.

582
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,070
I'll research it.

583
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,590
Tang San.

584
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,950
Leave with Wu for now.

585
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,070
I'll research it with Master.

586
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,190
And also,

587
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,430
don't tell anyone else about this for now.

588
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:13,920
Understood.

589
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:16,950
Let's go.

590
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,896
Do you need anything?

591
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,040
Earlier you said

592
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,590
that the one you were looking for had appeared.

593
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,310
Was it Bu Le?

594
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,760
Tell me what you know.

595
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,640
This matter concerns Wu's security.

596
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,400
Before Wu is safe,

597
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,640
I won't let anyone else get involved.

598
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,280
Sir, how is it?

599
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,680
It's definitely poison.

600
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,070
But it's hard to determine the amount inside.

601
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,160
Is it the same poison used on Wu?

602
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,400
It's different. This is even more dangerous.

603
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,000
If you give me a month's time,

604
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,400
I can probably develop the antidote.

605
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,000
If we wait any longer.

606
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I will die of anxiety.

607
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,160
If you really break this bottle

608
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
in front of someone,

609
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,560
then it's likely that everyone else in the area
will die too.

610
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,590
I'll make sure no one is nearby

611
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,190
and find alone time with Du Gu Yan.

612
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,760
Think this over.

613
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,230
Do you want to save someone,

614
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,520
or kill someone?

615
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,000
Give it to me.

616
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,520
I'll enter the Star Forest alone tomorrow.

617
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,230
You're willing to kill another person?

618
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,830
What else can I do, Sir?

619
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,430
I don't have a choice.

620
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,400
If I don't do it, Wu will die.

621
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,560
I'm not a good brother.

622
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:53,950
But I know

623
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,680
that I want to protect her.

624
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,430
No matter...

625
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,310
No matter what it takes.

626
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,146
Brother.

627
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,800
I'm a little scared if you're like this.

628
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,680
I scared you, Wu.

629
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:08,680
Don't be scared.

630
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:09,830
Sit down.

631
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,640
Who says you don't have a choice?

632
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,400
Good news!

633
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,760
I asked around and found out that

634
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:21,920
someone

635
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,760
has seen a Soul Master

636
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,640
that wears a cherry blossom on her head.

637
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,520
She just

638
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,950
entered the Star Forest tonight,

639
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:27,950
which means

640
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,590
that even if we only go tomorrow morning,

641
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,590
we'll be able to catch up with her.

642
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,470
Good news always comes along with bad news.

643
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:34,562
Tell us.

644
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:35,830
What's the bad news?

645
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,760
The bad news is

646
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,160
that accompanying her is

647
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,146
someone with Eight Soul Rings,
and another with Seven Soul Rings.

648
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:47,110
This bottle is filled with a potent poison.

649
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,560
Even if we find Du Gu Yan,

650
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,520
defeat the Grand Soul Master
and the Soul Saint with her,

651
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,350
we'll still have to face

652
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,280
the choice between saving
and killing a person.

653
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,070
That's why there is a second choice.

654
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,760
Know your enemy and know yourself,
you'd never be defeated.

655
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,590
Since Ye Zhi Qiu is targeting Du Gu Yan,

656
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,640
both of them must be related to each other.

657
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,590
If we are able to

658
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,160
find Du Gu Yan,

659
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,710
then perhaps we can find out

660
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,000
Ye Zhi Qiu's history.

661
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,070
But what's the point

662
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:14,920
of knowing Ye Zhi Qiu's history?

663
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,640
Tang San.

664
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,000
Everyone has a weakness.

665
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,760
No one is really a single independent entity.

666
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,760
Ye Zhi Qiu is no exception.

667
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,520
Your weakness is Wu.

668
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,280
Ye Zhi Qiu knows that you will save her.

669
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,680
That's why he blackmailed you.

670
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:26,800
Likewise,

671
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:27,760
Why don't we

672
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,520
give him a dose of his own medicine?

673
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,280
Once we know Ye Zhi Qiu's history,

674
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,680
we'll know what he's afraid of.

675
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,880
If we take his weakness,

676
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,950
we can force him to give us the antidote.

677
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,230
Tang San.

678
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,560
The school

679
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,430
will never give up on Wu.

680
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,070
Don't worry.

681
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:44,880
Alright.

682
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,430
Leave the bottle with me.

683
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,590
We'll enter the Star Forest tomorrow morning.

684
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:49,800
We told everyone

685
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,562
that we're helping Ou Si Ke
to advance to Triple Soul Rings.

686
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,190
But our real motive

687
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,710
is to find Du Gu Yan.

688
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,160
It's not to kill her.

689
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,400
Sir.

690
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,040
How can I find Du Gu Yan?

691
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,350
Wait for an opportunity.

692
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,590
Then what do I need to do?

693
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:10,920
We'll act together.

694
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,190
Help Ou Si Ke to hunt
a Millennium Soul Beast.

695
00:31:13,562 --> 00:31:14,640
The blood of a Millennium Soul Beast

696
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,160
will attract nearby Soul Beasts,

697
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,400
including poisonous Soul Beasts.

698
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,040
According to my research,

699
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,280
the corpse and Soul Rings of
a Millennium Soul Beast

700
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,040
will not dissipate for at least

701
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,110
Fifteen minutes.

702
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,920
There are so many Soul Beasts gathering together.

703
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,920
Won't there be danger?

704
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,880
As long as Ou Si Ke can absorb the Soul Rings

705
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,800
before a large group of Soul Beasts gather,

706
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,070
it will cut off the smell of blood.

707
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,280
Even if a lot of Soul Beasts came,

708
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,000
the other kids here can still manage

709
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,160
the beasts well.

710
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,160
If it still doesn't work,

711
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,230
there's always you, Headmaster.

712
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,470
Will she appear?

713
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,470
Even if there's a Grand Soul Master
and a Soul Saint with her,

714
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,437
and no matter how powerful they are,

715
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,160
they will still need a few days to track

716
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,950
before they can find out
the poisonous Millennium Soul Beast.

717
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,920
When they realize that Soul Beasts have gathered,

718
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,070
they might follow us.

719
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,280
Let's just try our luck.

720
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,070
Alright.

721
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,190
Let's all rest here.

722
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,880
This forest is really big.

723
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,800
This place is almost as big as a kingdom.

724
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,160
We'd need more than a few days to pass through.

725
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,880
I thought there's

726
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,590
supposed to be a lot of Soul Beasts here?

727
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,400
Why haven't we seen any yet?

728
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,560
This is just the outskirts of the forest.

729
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,230
There won't be strong Soul Beasts here.

730
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,520
So it's still quite safe.

731
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,040
Our objective this time

732
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,310
is to help Ou Si Ke

733
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,430
hunt and kill a compatible
Millennium Soul Beast.

734
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,800
That's why we must continue to proceed.

735
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:00,830
Be careful, everyone.

736
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,590
The deeper we go, the more dangerous it gets.

737
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,230
Then... are there any normal animals

738
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,270
in the forest?

739
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,080
Of course.

740
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,120
For instance, at this height,

741
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,880
we'll be able to see large lizards.

742
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,400
These lizards don't have Soul Rings in them,

743
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:14,790
but there are many Soul Beasts

744
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,120
that like to eat lizards like that.

745
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,550
In this forest,

746
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,880
the strong

747
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,430
preys on the weak.

748
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,790
This is the predatory law in the forest.

749
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,670
I've heard the villagers talking about this.

750
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,240
Big fish eats small fish,

751
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,120
small fish eats the shrimp,

752
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,760
and the shrimps eat the mud, right?

753
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,670
Mud can't help you up the wall.
[*A Chinese idiom]

754
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,000
Are we playing Idiom Solitaire?

755
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,120
I'm really good at it.

756
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,390
You're talking too much, Ou Si Ke.

757
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,190
Let's go.

758
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,270
Let's maintain our pace.

759
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,480
Don't get left behind.

760
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,310
And also

761
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,840
be careful of what you step on.

762
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,080
Vines and pit holes.

763
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,790
We must pay attention.

764
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,840
There is a Soul Beast called Araki,

765
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,510
which has a unique trait.

766
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,480
It looks like a dead tree.

767
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,310
When it's not hunting,
you won't be able to see the difference.

768
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,670
Vines?

769
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,600
Save me!

770
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,360
Hold on.

771
00:34:00,354 --> 00:34:01,187
Release your Martial Soul.

772
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,150
Your Evil Phoenix

773
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,760
is the strongest against plant type Soul Beast.

774
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:15,680
Are you alright?

775
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,360
Are you alright?

776
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,920
I was frightened just now.

777
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,400
Your Martial Soul is part of you.

778
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,270
Sync your body with your Martial Soul to

779
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:23,880
build your instincts.

780
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,080
Got it.

781
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,080
I really never expected this Star Forest

782
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,160
to be so dangerous.

783
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:28,550
That's right.

784
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,200
You've all witnessed how terrifying

785
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,400
this forest can be.

786
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:32,440
So let me give all of you

787
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,200
a piece of advice.

788
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,640
Make sure you are fully focused,

789
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:37,600
and face this forest

790
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,680
in your best condition.

791
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,470
We've already run a few hundred miles just now

792
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,550
How can we maintain our best condition?

793
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,640
Easy.

794
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,880
You just need Ou Si Ke.

795
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,360
Me?

796
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,230
None of you have seen

797
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,310
Ou Si Ke's Martial Soul, right?

798
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,710
We really haven't seen it.

799
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,600
Display your Martial Soul, Ou Si Ke!

800
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,230
I don't think it's necessary.

801
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,640
I'm not even ready.

802
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,510
You're the only one who can let

803
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,062
everyone regain
our physical strength and spirit.

804
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,510
You don't want anyone here to get hurt, right?

805
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,080
Are you doing this on purpose?

806
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,920
I am doing this on purpose.

807
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,160
Actually, your Martial Soul

808
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,030
is really special and impressive.

809
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,360
It's unique!

810
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,550
Well... alright then.

811
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,200
Hold on to this for me.

812
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,920
You even changed into a costume?

813
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,230
Well... I...

814
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:38,510
I...

815
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,200
