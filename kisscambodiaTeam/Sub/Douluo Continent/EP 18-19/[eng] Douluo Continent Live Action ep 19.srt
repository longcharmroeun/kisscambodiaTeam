14
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:42,836
<i>Episode 19</i>

15
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:49,997
Is this my Martial Soul?

16
00:01:50,357 --> 00:01:51,276
Actually, I'm just like you.

17
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:53,357
When I'm attacking,

18
00:01:53,997 --> 00:01:55,276
I can only watch from the side.

19
00:02:01,157 --> 00:02:02,316
But I have traveled around
the Douluo Continent as well.

20
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:04,516
To be honest,
I fought a lot too.

21
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:06,997
Remember, the reality is not an arena.

22
00:02:07,357 --> 00:02:08,516
When there's danger,

23
00:02:09,236 --> 00:02:11,196
the opponent won't care
if you're Support Branch Soul Masters.

24
00:02:12,077 --> 00:02:13,276
If someone wants to kill you,

25
00:02:13,757 --> 00:02:14,276
what will you do?

26
00:02:14,516 --> 00:02:16,237
It's okay, we have comrades.

27
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:17,957
What if you're alone

28
00:02:18,636 --> 00:02:20,196
and your opponent
is a Combat Branch Soul Master?

29
00:02:21,437 --> 00:02:24,396
There will be nothing I can do then.

30
00:02:24,997 --> 00:02:27,036
Support Branch Soul Masters
can fight too.

31
00:02:27,556 --> 00:02:28,157
For real?

32
00:02:28,237 --> 00:02:29,276
Impossible.

33
00:02:29,997 --> 00:02:32,196
Everyone's Martial Soul is fixed.

34
00:02:32,636 --> 00:02:34,517
How can
Support Branch Soul Masters fight?

35
00:02:36,836 --> 00:02:37,317
Look.

36
00:02:42,317 --> 00:02:42,756
What's that?

37
00:02:42,756 --> 00:02:43,276
Nothing.

38
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:44,517
It's just a dusty ordinary box.

39
00:02:45,556 --> 00:02:46,556
-Come down!
-Don't touch me!

40
00:02:47,396 --> 00:02:47,836
Don't touch me!

41
00:02:48,636 --> 00:02:49,196
Get up.

42
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:49,997
No.

43
00:02:50,077 --> 00:02:51,196
No, I can't.

44
00:02:51,317 --> 00:02:51,717
You must not see it.

45
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:52,957
Get up!

46
00:02:52,957 --> 00:02:55,036
Ouch.

47
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:56,276
Don't look...

48
00:03:00,317 --> 00:03:01,237
There are so many things.

49
00:03:01,957 --> 00:03:02,756
I've asked Lander.

50
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:04,597
You made these by yourself, right?

51
00:03:05,517 --> 00:03:06,476
You made it?

52
00:03:06,476 --> 00:03:07,276
Yeah.

53
00:03:07,357 --> 00:03:09,396
I want to act,
so I can only make

54
00:03:09,396 --> 00:03:10,756
props and costumes by myself.

55
00:03:12,157 --> 00:03:13,636
Those are scripts.

56
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:16,597
This...

57
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,717
I modified it from old curtains.

58
00:03:21,877 --> 00:03:22,717
You don't need to see it.

59
00:03:24,077 --> 00:03:25,357
You sew it by yourself?

60
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:26,877
I really can't tell that

61
00:03:26,877 --> 00:03:28,597
you have the qualities of
a good wife and a mother.

62
00:03:29,556 --> 00:03:31,196
I can't afford it.

63
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:34,276
There are so many things

64
00:03:34,556 --> 00:03:35,756
and costumes here.

65
00:03:35,756 --> 00:03:36,357
Who wears it?

66
00:03:36,636 --> 00:03:37,517
I wear it.

67
00:03:38,077 --> 00:03:38,717
What about this?

68
00:03:39,597 --> 00:03:40,676
This is women's clothing.

69
00:03:41,636 --> 00:03:42,717
You also wear women's clothing?

70
00:03:42,797 --> 00:03:43,756
Isn't there

71
00:03:43,836 --> 00:03:45,836
a female character in a play?

72
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,276
This is my prop for a magic show.

73
00:03:51,636 --> 00:03:52,196
Very good.

74
00:03:52,597 --> 00:03:54,317
When I was in Star Town,
Lander lent me

75
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,116
one of your props.

76
00:03:56,077 --> 00:03:57,036
I find it very useful.

77
00:03:57,157 --> 00:03:57,997
You really used it?

78
00:03:59,797 --> 00:04:01,756
But aren't you going to
teach us to fight?

79
00:04:01,957 --> 00:04:03,476
What does it get to do with fighting?

80
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,036
Your battle starts with these.

81
00:04:06,636 --> 00:04:07,396
Are you serious?

82
00:04:07,396 --> 00:04:08,077
These?

83
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:11,437
Do you want us to fight
with a magic show?

84
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:12,396
This...

85
00:04:12,756 --> 00:04:14,036
Do you want to surprise everyone?

86
00:04:27,437 --> 00:04:27,877
Wait a minute.

87
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:30,516
I think something's wrong.

88
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,556
Even if Headmaster is fast,

89
00:04:32,676 --> 00:04:34,197
he can't be so much faster than us.

90
00:04:34,477 --> 00:04:36,477
Besides, my Soul Skill is Teleport.

91
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,076
He can't avoid it all the time.

92
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:39,556
So?

93
00:04:41,116 --> 00:04:42,037
I'll try again.

94
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:42,796
Help me to observe.

95
00:04:42,836 --> 00:04:43,276
Okay.

96
00:04:44,276 --> 00:04:45,516
Headmaster, wait for me for a while.

97
00:04:45,516 --> 00:04:45,956
Okay.

98
00:04:54,717 --> 00:04:55,076
Wind?

99
00:04:56,637 --> 00:04:57,157
Well?

100
00:04:57,276 --> 00:04:59,356
There was a sudden gust of wind
before you appear,

101
00:04:59,356 --> 00:05:00,556
that's why the bells rang.

102
00:05:01,236 --> 00:05:01,717
Wind?

103
00:05:08,956 --> 00:05:10,396
<i>The requirement
for Wu's training this time</i>

104
00:05:10,796 --> 00:05:12,197
is to discover the problem of
the new Soul Skill.

105
00:05:12,956 --> 00:05:14,676
Do you mean Teleport?

106
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:16,516
Teleport is just external.

107
00:05:16,796 --> 00:05:18,197
She needs to see what's behind it.

108
00:05:18,717 --> 00:05:20,556
If she understands
how her Teleport works,

109
00:05:20,796 --> 00:05:21,477
she'll notice

110
00:05:22,317 --> 00:05:24,317
that her Teleport
has a huge weakness.

111
00:05:25,717 --> 00:05:27,757
You just saw her use it once,

112
00:05:28,076 --> 00:05:29,917
but you've found her weakness?

113
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:31,836
This is my weakness.

114
00:05:32,236 --> 00:05:32,637
The wind?

115
00:05:34,236 --> 00:05:36,676
A breeze will appear before I land.

116
00:05:39,836 --> 00:05:42,956
Headmaster judged my position by that.

117
00:05:43,116 --> 00:05:44,717
That's why he could avoid my sneak attacks.

118
00:05:48,477 --> 00:05:49,917
But I don't understand

119
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,356
why Teleport produces wind.

120
00:05:52,796 --> 00:05:53,556
It's like this.

121
00:05:54,477 --> 00:05:56,877
Your Soul Skill
seems like a Teleport,

122
00:05:57,236 --> 00:05:59,116
but it's actually space interchange.

123
00:05:59,717 --> 00:06:02,236
The space where you land
interchanges with the starting point.

124
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:04,236
A whole piece of space
will be removed first.

125
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:06,356
Then, you will be swapped there.

126
00:06:07,396 --> 00:06:08,597
When the space is removed,

127
00:06:08,757 --> 00:06:10,356
it'll remove a part of the air.

128
00:06:10,556 --> 00:06:13,917
So it'll cause a wind pressure
in a short time

129
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:14,956
and shrink towards the centre.

130
00:06:15,437 --> 00:06:16,877
That's why there's a breeze.

131
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,396
I use this

132
00:06:18,516 --> 00:06:20,157
to predict your landing point.

133
00:06:20,956 --> 00:06:22,076
Do you understand?

134
00:06:23,757 --> 00:06:25,556
These are the original words of Master.

135
00:06:26,157 --> 00:06:28,076
Although he only has Double Soul Rings,

136
00:06:28,437 --> 00:06:29,956
his theoretical knowledge

137
00:06:30,037 --> 00:06:31,637
is our greatest treasure.

138
00:06:32,197 --> 00:06:34,276
Wu, now you know

139
00:06:34,276 --> 00:06:35,317
about your weakness.

140
00:06:35,556 --> 00:06:36,717
Next, think about

141
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:38,956
how to solve the problem
in actual combats.

142
00:06:40,597 --> 00:06:41,076
Carry on.

143
00:06:44,956 --> 00:06:46,037
Don't touch the bell, either.

144
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:47,757
But if I don't touch the bell,

145
00:06:47,877 --> 00:06:48,637
I'll slow down.

146
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:50,276
Let's try once.

147
00:07:02,437 --> 00:07:04,076
Using three Soul Skills at once

148
00:07:04,356 --> 00:07:05,437
is too exhausting.

149
00:07:06,556 --> 00:07:07,317
I don't get it.

150
00:07:07,757 --> 00:07:08,757
What's the point of training in this way?

151
00:07:11,796 --> 00:07:12,877
I heard a story

152
00:07:13,717 --> 00:07:15,236
about an old lady
grinding an iron rod

153
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,516
into a needle by the river.

154
00:07:17,356 --> 00:07:18,637
Does Master mean that?

155
00:07:19,717 --> 00:07:20,477
What's the use of needles?

156
00:07:20,997 --> 00:07:22,116
To poke people during a fight?

157
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:23,477
Besides,

158
00:07:23,757 --> 00:07:25,076
isn't it better to just buy a needle?

159
00:07:27,116 --> 00:07:27,597
That's true.

160
00:07:29,317 --> 00:07:29,877
Brother Dai.

161
00:07:30,637 --> 00:07:32,556
Do you think there was something wrong just now?

162
00:07:32,836 --> 00:07:33,877
It's way too wrong.

163
00:07:34,197 --> 00:07:35,637
The three of us
beating the rock like the idiots.

164
00:07:36,116 --> 00:07:36,836
What's the point?

165
00:07:37,516 --> 00:07:38,276
A theory is a theory.

166
00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:40,396
Are you questioning
Master's theory?

167
00:07:40,637 --> 00:07:41,676
You guys carry on, I'm leaving.

168
00:07:41,997 --> 00:07:42,477
Wait a minute!

169
00:07:43,676 --> 00:07:45,037
When we did a cooperative attack
just now,

170
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,276
we were actually exhausting each other.

171
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:49,917
What do you mean?

172
00:07:50,796 --> 00:07:52,597
There was one particularly
obvious attack just now.

173
00:07:53,276 --> 00:07:53,757
Look.

174
00:07:54,717 --> 00:07:56,276
Let's say this is not a rock

175
00:07:56,997 --> 00:07:57,717
but an enemy.

176
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:09,556
First, my Blue Silver Plant bound him.

177
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:11,037
If he was the enemy,

178
00:08:11,037 --> 00:08:12,556
his movement should be affected.

179
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:13,556
But soon,

180
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:15,157
Ma Hong Jun's Phoenix Firing Line reached.

181
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,997
My Blue Silver Plant
was destroyed by the flame.

182
00:08:21,157 --> 00:08:23,556
Then came Brother Dai's
White Tiger Intense Light Wave.

183
00:08:27,556 --> 00:08:28,116
Look,

184
00:08:28,556 --> 00:08:30,197
My Blue Silver Plant
was destroyed just like that.

185
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,796
Our attacks interfere with each other.

186
00:08:33,356 --> 00:08:34,356
It seems like cooperation,

187
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:36,356
but it's actually weakened.

188
00:08:37,236 --> 00:08:38,396
So this is what Master meant.

189
00:08:39,236 --> 00:08:40,437
If we don't cooperate well
with each other,

190
00:08:40,757 --> 00:08:41,916
we can't even beat a rock.

191
00:08:41,957 --> 00:08:42,997
But we've worked hard.

192
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,837
We used our strongest Soul Skills.

193
00:08:45,397 --> 00:08:47,236
That's why our Soul Skills
should cooperate with others'.

194
00:08:47,556 --> 00:08:49,036
We can readjust the rhythm

195
00:08:49,397 --> 00:08:50,596
and sequence of our attacks.

196
00:08:51,517 --> 00:08:52,236
Let's try again.

197
00:09:44,397 --> 00:09:45,517
Where's Wu hiding?

198
00:09:45,637 --> 00:09:47,676
You can't touch me
without Wu's cooperation.

199
00:09:51,517 --> 00:09:52,156
We won.

200
00:09:55,356 --> 00:09:56,916
You purposely choose this position?

201
00:09:57,236 --> 00:09:59,156
There are few bells behind the tree

202
00:09:59,236 --> 00:10:01,356
and the teleporting wind
is blocked by the tree,

203
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:02,397
so I can't predict it.

204
00:10:03,356 --> 00:10:04,637
Thanks to Sister Qing's restraint.

205
00:10:05,036 --> 00:10:06,317
You asked me to avoid the bell.

206
00:10:06,556 --> 00:10:07,837
My speed has slowed down a lot,

207
00:10:08,077 --> 00:10:09,556
but I can force Headmaster
to see me clearly

208
00:10:09,757 --> 00:10:10,796
to judge my actions.

209
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:11,796
I get it now.

210
00:10:12,116 --> 00:10:13,397
Fast speed is good,

211
00:10:13,676 --> 00:10:15,156
but we need to keep quiet and hidden

212
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:16,837
to display the best advantage of speed.

213
00:10:18,397 --> 00:10:19,236
Very good.

214
00:10:19,757 --> 00:10:20,556
OK, let's continue.

215
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:22,156
See if you can touch me

216
00:10:22,277 --> 00:10:23,676
who's going all out.

217
00:10:28,676 --> 00:10:29,197
You did well.

218
00:10:30,116 --> 00:10:30,676
Brother.

219
00:10:33,517 --> 00:10:34,517
You did well during these days.

220
00:10:35,197 --> 00:10:35,757
Thanks, Master.

221
00:10:35,957 --> 00:10:36,796
You deserve this.

222
00:10:38,997 --> 00:10:39,596
Wipe it again.

223
00:10:42,397 --> 00:10:42,957
Wu.

224
00:10:43,757 --> 00:10:44,556
This place is full of smoke.

225
00:10:44,796 --> 00:10:46,236
Don't come with me next time.

226
00:10:46,716 --> 00:10:48,757
And the training is also hard
during the day.

227
00:10:49,156 --> 00:10:50,476
You should rest well at night.

228
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:51,236
Have a good rest.

229
00:10:52,556 --> 00:10:54,317
But you also trained hard
during the day.

230
00:10:54,517 --> 00:10:56,796
You still need to forge iron at night,
it's more tiring for you.

231
00:10:57,397 --> 00:10:59,676
Master and Headmaster
have worked hard to teach us.

232
00:10:59,716 --> 00:11:00,596
They spent a lot of money.

233
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:02,277
I should share their burden.

234
00:11:02,676 --> 00:11:03,757
The more the reason for me to come.

235
00:11:05,077 --> 00:11:06,437
Okay, I'll listen to you.

236
00:11:08,156 --> 00:11:09,236
I'll wash the towel.

237
00:11:25,236 --> 00:11:25,957
Wait a minute.

238
00:11:26,116 --> 00:11:27,036
I'll pour you a glass of water.

239
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:30,317
Slowly.

240
00:11:30,596 --> 00:11:31,116
Okay!

241
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:43,036
What's this?

242
00:11:45,116 --> 00:11:46,476
This is the blacksmith's logo.

243
00:11:47,077 --> 00:11:49,317
Every smithy hangs a string of wind chimes.

244
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:51,116
It sounds nice.

245
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,236
You made it?

246
00:11:54,716 --> 00:11:55,716
I'm a blacksmith.

247
00:11:56,517 --> 00:11:58,517
Here will be our smithy from now on.

248
00:11:59,236 --> 00:12:01,356
You have to learn to forge iron too
when you grow up.

249
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:02,997
I'll grow up tomorrow.

250
00:12:03,397 --> 00:12:04,676
Kids must not lie.

251
00:12:05,837 --> 00:12:07,437
When will I grow up?

252
00:12:10,156 --> 00:12:11,997
When you can reach those wind chimes.

253
00:12:14,476 --> 00:12:15,277
No jumping.

254
00:12:16,317 --> 00:12:16,796
Okay.

255
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:18,957
Here.

256
00:12:24,156 --> 00:12:25,116
I reached it!

257
00:12:48,036 --> 00:12:48,877
What are you thinking about?

258
00:12:52,877 --> 00:12:53,556
I'm thinking about my father.

259
00:12:55,197 --> 00:12:56,796
But why are you looking at those wind chimes?

260
00:12:57,596 --> 00:12:58,397
My father said that

261
00:12:59,556 --> 00:13:01,556
wind chimes are the logo
of the smithy.

262
00:13:02,637 --> 00:13:05,356
Every smithy will use
the best raw materials

263
00:13:05,796 --> 00:13:07,556
and the most exquisite craftsmanship
to forge a string of wind chimes

264
00:13:08,077 --> 00:13:09,596
and hang them at the gate
to attract customers.

265
00:13:10,317 --> 00:13:11,277
If you're an expert,

266
00:13:12,116 --> 00:13:13,716
the craftsmanship of that smithy

267
00:13:14,397 --> 00:13:16,757
can be judged by the tone
of the wind chimes.

268
00:13:19,077 --> 00:13:20,236
When I was at home,

269
00:13:21,156 --> 00:13:22,837
I didn't think
it had any special meaning.

270
00:13:24,197 --> 00:13:25,277
Now that I've been away from home
for so long,

271
00:13:26,036 --> 00:13:27,596
whenever I hear the sound
wind chimes

272
00:13:28,116 --> 00:13:29,397
and smell the fire,

273
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:31,556
I'll think of my father.

274
00:13:34,796 --> 00:13:35,156
Forget it.

275
00:13:35,596 --> 00:13:36,317
Stop talking about this.

276
00:13:37,036 --> 00:13:37,916
Let's go back to the school.

277
00:13:38,476 --> 00:13:38,837
Okay.

278
00:13:52,556 --> 00:13:53,476
Why are you so noisy?

279
00:13:53,997 --> 00:13:55,197
I can't control it.

280
00:13:58,317 --> 00:13:59,637
Yours are quite loud too.

281
00:14:01,476 --> 00:14:02,957
I can still have one fewer meal.

282
00:14:03,356 --> 00:14:05,476
Then I'll have three fewer meals.

283
00:14:07,476 --> 00:14:08,236
Do you want to compete with me?

284
00:14:08,676 --> 00:14:09,676
Let's compete then.

285
00:14:15,716 --> 00:14:17,277
Seriously, Wu found

286
00:14:17,716 --> 00:14:19,077
her weakness in her Martial Soul

287
00:14:19,077 --> 00:14:19,997
in just one day.

288
00:14:20,796 --> 00:14:23,197
Zhu Zhu Qing also fully experienced

289
00:14:23,356 --> 00:14:25,517
the tactical meaning of covert actions.

290
00:14:26,317 --> 00:14:28,517
Both of them are geniuses.

291
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:29,997
Their responses are quick.

292
00:14:31,156 --> 00:14:32,317
I checked them outside the village.

293
00:14:32,556 --> 00:14:34,236
Tang San and the others
have discovered their issues

294
00:14:35,077 --> 00:14:36,757
and started trying
real cooperative tactics.

295
00:14:37,837 --> 00:14:39,757
These kids are smart.

296
00:14:40,997 --> 00:14:41,997
But I'm still worried.

297
00:14:42,277 --> 00:14:43,236
There are only five days left.

298
00:14:43,837 --> 00:14:45,236
They won't be able to
cooperate well.

299
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:48,837
Based on my actual combat experience
for many years,

300
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:53,596
I can help them to progress

301
00:14:53,997 --> 00:14:54,757
in light of their shortcomings.

302
00:14:56,716 --> 00:14:57,517
What should we do next?

303
00:14:58,517 --> 00:15:00,877
Dai Wei Shi and Dai Mu Bai
are both

304
00:15:01,197 --> 00:15:02,517
Power Attack Soul Masters.

305
00:15:03,476 --> 00:15:06,156
So the key of this battle is Tang San.

306
00:15:06,476 --> 00:15:08,796
Because Tang San
is a Control Branch Soul Master,

307
00:15:09,197 --> 00:15:11,556
the nemesis of
the Power Attack Soul Master.

308
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:13,637
I know it,

309
00:15:14,116 --> 00:15:14,796
but Dai Wei Shi

310
00:15:14,796 --> 00:15:16,517
can escape from
the Constraint of Spider Web

311
00:15:17,277 --> 00:15:18,796
if he keeps a distance from Tang San.

312
00:15:19,077 --> 00:15:20,916
If we can increase Tang San's

313
00:15:20,997 --> 00:15:23,676
usage of his third Soul Skill

314
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:24,796
and control range,

315
00:15:25,517 --> 00:15:28,197
it can strengthen his control
over the enemies

316
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:31,877
and prevent Dai Wei Shi
from getting out of attack range.

317
00:15:33,236 --> 00:15:34,437
You're smart, Lander.

318
00:15:34,796 --> 00:15:35,277
Yes.

319
00:15:35,877 --> 00:15:37,556
The attacks of Control Branch
Soul Masters are very weak.

320
00:15:38,036 --> 00:15:39,517
I originally planned to
focus on training

321
00:15:39,556 --> 00:15:40,317
Tang San's attack power,

322
00:15:40,796 --> 00:15:42,356
but it's hard to achieve it

323
00:15:43,077 --> 00:15:44,236
in such a short time.

324
00:15:44,517 --> 00:15:45,356
So we only need to

325
00:15:45,356 --> 00:15:46,916
train his controlling power.

326
00:15:47,476 --> 00:15:48,637
The task of frontal attack

327
00:15:48,637 --> 00:15:50,517
will be entrusted to Dai Mu Bai
and Ma Hong Jun.

328
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,116
And then there are Zhu Zhu Qing
and Wu's sneak attacks.

329
00:15:53,476 --> 00:15:55,036
They can make up
for each other's shortcomings

330
00:15:55,676 --> 00:15:57,556
and display each other's strength.

331
00:15:58,077 --> 00:15:59,596
You're indeed the most experienced one

332
00:15:59,596 --> 00:16:01,197
in the Golden Iron Triangle.

333
00:16:02,116 --> 00:16:02,877
But I think

334
00:16:03,036 --> 00:16:04,757
their cooperation
can be more invincible.

335
00:16:06,437 --> 00:16:07,116
I mean,

336
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:08,877
if we add Ou Si Ke and Ning Rong Rong,

337
00:16:09,556 --> 00:16:10,277
it'll be perfect.

338
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,637
Support Branch Soul Masters
are not necessary.

339
00:16:12,676 --> 00:16:14,077
Just increase their Soul Power.

340
00:16:14,116 --> 00:16:15,957
There's no need to waste energy on them.

341
00:16:16,796 --> 00:16:17,877
Do you think it's useless to train them?

342
00:16:17,957 --> 00:16:18,877
It's useless.

343
00:16:20,236 --> 00:16:20,476
Okay.

344
00:16:21,036 --> 00:16:22,757
Let's arrange for Ou Si Ke
and the others

345
00:16:22,757 --> 00:16:24,356
to fight against Ma Hong Jun
the day after tomorrow.

346
00:16:25,077 --> 00:16:26,356
Of course Ma Hong Jun will win.

347
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:28,197
You'll know the result then.

348
00:16:29,716 --> 00:16:30,757
Let's make a bet.

349
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:32,957
Two Gold Soul Coins.

350
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:34,957
So much?

351
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:40,236
I'll win for sure.

352

353
00:16:59,596 --> 00:17:01,036
The rhythm is messed up.
Stop it.

354
00:17:01,476 --> 00:17:02,277
You're here, Master.

355
00:17:04,277 --> 00:17:05,397
Drink some water
and take a break.

356
00:17:14,517 --> 00:17:16,116
You sleep late
and get up early every day

357
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:17,517
just to have more time

358
00:17:17,517 --> 00:17:18,397
to train your Soul Skills.

359
00:17:19,116 --> 00:17:21,316
But haste makes waste.
Do what you can.

360
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,716
Both Brother Dai
and Ma Hong Jun can do it.

361
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:24,917
I'm lagging behind.

362
00:17:25,196 --> 00:17:26,436
I want to catch up with them
as soon as possible.

363
00:17:27,757 --> 00:17:29,397
Don't be anxious, there's time.

364
00:17:30,157 --> 00:17:30,596
No.

365
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,757
Time is running out for me.

366
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:34,677
My father's matter

367
00:17:35,157 --> 00:17:36,637
and the task given by Ye Zhi Qiu

368
00:17:37,397 --> 00:17:39,236
are forcing me to get stronger
at every moment.

369
00:17:40,277 --> 00:17:41,716
But I'm not strong enough.

370
00:17:42,836 --> 00:17:44,836
If I can't even do well
in daily training,

371
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:45,877
how can I

372
00:17:45,877 --> 00:17:47,037
challenge a stronger opponent

373
00:17:47,076 --> 00:17:48,037
and find my father?

374
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:49,716
Tang San.

375
00:17:50,677 --> 00:17:51,677
Have you

376
00:17:51,716 --> 00:17:52,677
lost faith in yourself?

377
00:17:55,716 --> 00:17:56,956
When we were in
the Soul Hunting Forest,

378
00:17:57,836 --> 00:17:58,436
you asked me

379
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:00,236
why my Martial Soul is lost.

380
00:18:02,436 --> 00:18:04,037
I failed to advance
my Martial Soul back then.

381
00:18:04,596 --> 00:18:05,797
Luo San Pao mutated.

382
00:18:06,236 --> 00:18:06,877
Since then,

383
00:18:07,476 --> 00:18:09,476
I feel like my world has gone still.

384
00:18:10,436 --> 00:18:11,557
I thought if I worked harder,

385
00:18:11,917 --> 00:18:12,956
my Soul Power would have a breakthrough.

386
00:18:14,637 --> 00:18:15,196
But when I realized

387
00:18:15,196 --> 00:18:16,757
my appearance had never changed since then,

388
00:18:18,116 --> 00:18:18,757
I found that

389
00:18:19,436 --> 00:18:20,356
no matter how hard I tried,

390
00:18:21,637 --> 00:18:23,476
I couldn't break through
my Soul Power.

391
00:18:24,196 --> 00:18:25,997
This is the most painful thing
for a Soul Master.

392
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:29,596
Master, I'm sorry

393
00:18:30,316 --> 00:18:31,596
for reminding you of your bad sufferings.

394
00:18:32,956 --> 00:18:35,076
It's all right, I've got used to it.

395
00:18:35,997 --> 00:18:37,637
I was just like you
when I was young.

396
00:18:37,677 --> 00:18:38,757
I had a lot of worries.

397
00:18:39,716 --> 00:18:40,956
I was afraid to disappoint
those who loved me,

398
00:18:41,757 --> 00:18:42,596
to let them down

399
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,356
and to let others look down on me.

400
00:18:46,716 --> 00:18:49,037
So I decided to leave the clan

401
00:18:49,116 --> 00:18:49,836
and my best friends.

402
00:18:50,757 --> 00:18:51,877
I went to Martial Soul Hall

403
00:18:52,677 --> 00:18:54,356
to study the theory of Mutant Soul.

404
00:18:54,637 --> 00:18:55,316
And then?

405
00:18:57,157 --> 00:18:58,637
Then because of some things
and people,

406
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,677
I had to leave the Martial Soul Hall.

407
00:19:00,397 --> 00:19:01,397
I also gave up my research.

408
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:04,476
I almost lost
all of my confidence back then.

409
00:19:05,757 --> 00:19:07,277
Then, I hid in Nuoding School.

410
00:19:07,757 --> 00:19:09,236
And I met you at Nuoding School.

411
00:19:09,956 --> 00:19:10,596
As soon as you entered the school,

412
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,517
you released Xiao Chen Yu's rabbit.

413
00:19:14,356 --> 00:19:14,997
You also

414
00:19:14,997 --> 00:19:16,356
dare to be the enemy
of those arrogant people.

415
00:19:17,397 --> 00:19:19,236
I was fearless because I didn't know.

416
00:19:19,557 --> 00:19:20,517
But when I think about it now,

417
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:22,877
if you and Wu weren't there,

418
00:19:23,517 --> 00:19:24,836
I'm afraid I couldn't hold on.

419
00:19:28,157 --> 00:19:29,757
Wu and I will continue to support you.

420
00:19:31,517 --> 00:19:33,277
Thank you, Master.

421
00:19:35,436 --> 00:19:36,716
I should be the one thanking you.

422
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:38,836
You gave me new hope.

423
00:19:39,716 --> 00:19:40,316
You let me know that

424
00:19:40,316 --> 00:19:41,997
if I keep working hard
towards my goal,

425
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:44,797
destiny will bring me new surprises.

426
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:46,356
So I restarted my research

427
00:19:46,356 --> 00:19:47,596
on the theory of the Martial Soul.

428
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:49,476
I'll stay at Shi Lan Ke School

429
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,356
and set off again
towards the goal of my youth.

430
00:19:53,116 --> 00:19:54,116
Even if it's slow,

431
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:55,836
as long as I'm on the right track,

432
00:19:56,517 --> 00:19:57,757
I'll reach the end.

433
00:19:59,277 --> 00:20:01,637
But I'm afraid that I can't do well.

434
00:20:02,877 --> 00:20:03,596
I believe in you.

435
00:20:04,196 --> 00:20:05,917
You're the most hardworking
and diligent one.

436
00:20:06,757 --> 00:20:08,157
You're my proudest student.

437
00:20:08,517 --> 00:20:09,517
Even if your father was here,

438
00:20:09,997 --> 00:20:10,877
I would still say so.

439
00:20:12,757 --> 00:20:15,196
Would my father care about these?

440
00:20:16,596 --> 00:20:17,397
There's no father

441
00:20:17,397 --> 00:20:18,877
who doesn't love his children.

442
00:20:19,277 --> 00:20:20,316
Your father loves you very much.

443
00:20:20,716 --> 00:20:21,836
He just doesn't know
how to express it.

444
00:20:22,757 --> 00:20:23,356
Really?

445
00:20:27,716 --> 00:20:28,277
Take it slow.

446
00:20:28,956 --> 00:20:30,236
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

447
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,557
There's a saying,

448
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:34,637
my fate is in my own hands.

449
00:20:35,356 --> 00:20:36,677
I think this sentence
is suitable for you.

450
00:20:38,757 --> 00:20:40,596
My fate is in my own hands?

451
00:20:40,716 --> 00:20:41,716
It sounds familiar.

452
00:20:42,836 --> 00:20:44,797
But when my Martial Soul awakened,

453
00:20:44,836 --> 00:20:46,277
I decided to abandon the martial world.

454
00:20:46,436 --> 00:20:47,637
My fate is in my own hands!

455
00:20:47,836 --> 00:20:49,356
What are you talking about?

456
00:20:49,557 --> 00:20:50,397
Stop the nonsense.

457
00:20:50,557 --> 00:20:52,517
Get back to the martial world
and be a Soul Master now!

458
00:20:54,076 --> 00:20:54,877
I gave this sentence to Ou Si Ke

459
00:20:54,877 --> 00:20:57,076
to encourage him

460
00:20:57,076 --> 00:20:57,917
to face up to himself.

461
00:20:58,557 --> 00:20:59,277
I didn't expect him

462
00:20:59,316 --> 00:21:01,196
to anger my brother
with this sentence.

463
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:02,397
I must

464
00:21:02,557 --> 00:21:04,196
find a chance to teach him a lesson.

465
00:21:05,316 --> 00:21:06,917
Master, it's like this.

466
00:21:07,757 --> 00:21:09,917
Ou Si Ke has some worries
because of his Martial Soul.

467
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:11,637
He needs time.

468
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:13,037
Besides,

469
00:21:13,116 --> 00:21:14,917
he's now working hard

470
00:21:15,157 --> 00:21:16,157
to be able to fight along with us.

471
00:21:18,116 --> 00:21:19,356
We're the Seven Devils of Shi Lan Ke.

472
00:21:21,397 --> 00:21:21,716
Okay.

473
00:21:22,757 --> 00:21:23,517
Adjust your rhythm.

474
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:24,877
Let's continue the training.

475
00:21:34,277 --> 00:21:36,116
I didn't hear anything.

476
00:21:37,037 --> 00:21:38,596
Tang San woke up early to train.

477
00:21:38,677 --> 00:21:40,196
I want to learn from him

478
00:21:41,356 --> 00:21:44,037
to prepare for the battle
with Ma Hong Jun.

479
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:49,076
Okay, let's train together.

480
00:21:50,397 --> 00:21:50,917
Can I?

481
00:21:53,956 --> 00:21:54,997
Is that enough?
I still have some more.

482
00:21:57,356 --> 00:21:57,997
What's enough?

483
00:21:59,397 --> 00:22:00,236
Ma Hong Jun!

484
00:22:05,436 --> 00:22:07,797
Miss, this is a smithy.

485
00:22:08,316 --> 00:22:09,997
The herbal store is on the next street.

486
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:11,277
I know.

487
00:22:11,917 --> 00:22:13,596
Sell me that string of wind chimes.

488
00:22:20,956 --> 00:22:21,677
Sister Wu.

489
00:22:21,997 --> 00:22:23,436
Why do you want to give
Brother San the wind chimes?

490
00:22:24,116 --> 00:22:26,116
They mean a lot to him.

491
00:22:26,356 --> 00:22:28,757
It's the sound of longing
and the symbol of home.

492
00:22:30,196 --> 00:22:32,836
I heard that his house is at
Saint of Soul Village, it's remote.

493
00:22:34,116 --> 00:22:35,997
I think if he has this,

494
00:22:36,476 --> 00:22:38,596
he won't be so homesick.

495
00:22:39,476 --> 00:22:40,397
You're so nice to him.

496
00:22:41,517 --> 00:22:43,517
Besides, he saved me so many times.

497
00:22:43,877 --> 00:22:45,076
I've been thinking

498
00:22:45,076 --> 00:22:45,917
to give him a meaningful gift for long.

499
00:22:48,356 --> 00:22:50,557
Sister Wu, did we suffer losses

500
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,997
from the deal just now?

501
00:22:53,436 --> 00:22:56,037
Losses?
Tang San said the loss is not delicious.

502
00:22:56,277 --> 00:22:58,157
I'll treat you with radishes.
Radishes are delicious.

503
00:22:58,476 --> 00:22:59,877
Suffer losses means

504
00:23:00,316 --> 00:23:02,116
we gave him a cart of precious herbs

505
00:23:02,157 --> 00:23:04,476
but he only gave us
a string of wind chimes.

506
00:23:04,637 --> 00:23:06,476
They earned and we lost money.

507
00:23:07,436 --> 00:23:08,637
I think it was a good deal.

508
00:23:08,716 --> 00:23:09,476
Why did we lose money?

509
00:23:09,757 --> 00:23:10,716
Think about it.

510
00:23:11,037 --> 00:23:12,637
We can sell the herbs
to the herbal store.

511
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:13,716
Let say it's sold

512
00:23:13,797 --> 00:23:15,356
at 50 Copper Soul Coins per herb,

513
00:23:15,716 --> 00:23:17,836
then, we save all the money
in the Soul Master's Bank.

514
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:18,677
There will be interest.

515
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,517
After that, we take out some capital

516
00:23:20,877 --> 00:23:21,917
to hire herbal workers

517
00:23:22,116 --> 00:23:23,797
and expand the scale of
herbs procurement, supply and marketing.

518
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:25,797
I've roughly calculated it.
Within a year,

519
00:23:26,116 --> 00:23:27,557
we can buy that smithy.

520
00:23:28,076 --> 00:23:29,476
Why do I want a smithy?

521
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:30,677
I just want this string of wind chimes.

522
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:31,637
With the smithy,

523
00:23:31,637 --> 00:23:33,277
you'll be the owner
of this wind chime naturally.

524
00:23:34,677 --> 00:23:36,397
It's so troublesome.

525
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:39,517
This is an investment.
We must be far-sighted.

526
00:23:41,757 --> 00:23:42,517
Headmaster.

527
00:23:44,277 --> 00:23:46,356
Hong Jun, I really didn't expect

528
00:23:46,436 --> 00:23:48,356
that you have this kind of talent.

529
00:23:48,596 --> 00:23:50,037
How about this?
I'll accept you as my disciple.

530
00:23:50,397 --> 00:23:52,196
Let's learn how to get rich

531
00:23:52,316 --> 00:23:53,677
and make progress together.

532
00:23:53,757 --> 00:23:55,076
Can I, Headmaster?

533
00:23:55,596 --> 00:23:57,517
Headmaster?
You should change the title.

534
00:23:57,757 --> 00:23:58,436
Master.

535
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:02,157
You'll be my direct disciple
from now on.

536
00:24:02,236 --> 00:24:02,877
Master.

537
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:04,436
Come in quickly, let's talk.

538
00:24:04,596 --> 00:24:05,277
Wu too.

539
00:24:05,596 --> 00:24:06,436
I'll find Tang San.

540
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:12,877
The trick just now was good.

541
00:24:13,436 --> 00:24:14,277
Of course.

542
00:24:16,196 --> 00:24:17,277
Wu, why are you here?

543
00:24:17,997 --> 00:24:18,596
Here you are.

544
00:24:22,997 --> 00:24:24,076
The wind chimes from the smithy?

545
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:26,436
If it accompanies you,

546
00:24:26,436 --> 00:24:27,557
you won't be so homesick.

547
00:24:28,997 --> 00:24:29,557
Thanks.

548
00:24:30,037 --> 00:24:31,196
I'll hang it on my bedside

549
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:32,797
so I can see it every day
when I open my eyes.

550
00:24:33,997 --> 00:24:35,356
How do you want to thank me?

551
00:24:36,277 --> 00:24:38,397
Why don't you fight me?

552
00:24:39,877 --> 00:24:40,757
Fight with me.

553
00:24:40,836 --> 00:24:42,557
Wu, you'll break my hand.

554
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,917
I'll fight with you, I'm strong too.

555
00:24:48,677 --> 00:24:49,236
No need.

556
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:52,116
Oh, right.

557
00:24:52,517 --> 00:24:53,677
I'm going to fight Ma Hong Jun later.

558
00:24:53,716 --> 00:24:54,397
I almost forgot it.

559
00:24:54,637 --> 00:24:55,517
I'll leave now.

560
00:24:55,557 --> 00:24:56,637
A fight? I want it too!

561
00:24:57,476 --> 00:24:58,637
It's their fight today.

562
00:24:59,037 --> 00:24:59,836
You can only watch.

563
00:25:02,436 --> 00:25:04,997
Okay, I'll just watch.

564
00:25:11,196 --> 00:25:11,757
Master.

565
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:20,757
When I was young,

566
00:25:21,356 --> 00:25:22,677
my father held me up

567
00:25:23,277 --> 00:25:25,116
and hung the wind chimes
in his smithy.

568
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:31,797
He's strong.

569
00:25:32,997 --> 00:25:34,476
He can hold me up at once.

570
00:25:35,956 --> 00:25:36,757
In my impression,

571
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:41,677
he seems to had held me up once only.

572
00:25:46,557 --> 00:25:47,797
Master, have a seat.

573
00:25:54,557 --> 00:25:54,997
Child.

574
00:25:55,877 --> 00:25:57,316
You have a very bad weakness.

575
00:25:58,236 --> 00:25:59,436
I'm afraid this weakness

576
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:01,076
will bring you even greater crisis
in the future.

577
00:26:01,557 --> 00:26:02,877
Tell me and I'll change it.

578
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:05,236
This is a weakness,

579
00:26:05,877 --> 00:26:06,677
but also a strength.

580
00:26:07,557 --> 00:26:08,716
You value feelings too much.

581
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:11,797
At Star Town,

582
00:26:12,356 --> 00:26:14,236
you were threatened by Ye Zhi Qiu
because of Wu.

583
00:26:15,236 --> 00:26:16,557
When you were at the Star Forest,

584
00:26:17,037 --> 00:26:18,476
if Wu had not been captured,

585
00:26:18,997 --> 00:26:20,236
you wouldn't have messed up

586
00:26:21,236 --> 00:26:22,677
and left the team in a haste.

587
00:26:23,397 --> 00:26:25,557
You even forcibly absorbed the Soul Ring
of Human Faced Demon Spider.

588
00:26:27,277 --> 00:26:27,917
I understand.

589
00:26:28,596 --> 00:26:29,157
Yes,

590
00:26:29,757 --> 00:26:31,076
whenever Wu is in danger,

591
00:26:31,596 --> 00:26:32,757
my brain will lose

592
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:33,797
most of its ability to judge.

593
00:26:35,076 --> 00:26:37,757
I just want to save her
and keep her safe.

594
00:26:38,677 --> 00:26:40,157
She's very important to you.

595
00:26:40,157 --> 00:26:40,877
I understand.

596
00:26:41,836 --> 00:26:43,157
I'm saying these

597
00:26:43,316 --> 00:26:44,316
because I hope that you'll remember

598
00:26:45,116 --> 00:26:46,157
to keep calm and think

599
00:26:46,476 --> 00:26:47,757
no matter what happens.

600
00:26:48,596 --> 00:26:50,557
Even if the most important person
to you is in danger,

601
00:26:51,116 --> 00:26:51,917
you have to stay calm.

602
00:26:53,316 --> 00:26:54,037
Many things

603
00:26:54,277 --> 00:26:55,637
can't be solved with impulse.

604
00:26:56,316 --> 00:26:57,397
You need to save yourself

605
00:26:58,037 --> 00:26:58,997
before you can save others.

606
00:26:59,196 --> 00:26:59,997
Do you understand?

607
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:02,836
I understand.

608
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,476
You should also remember it
when tracking down your father.

609
00:27:11,316 --> 00:27:12,037
Never make

610
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,637
the same mistake twice.

611
00:27:14,557 --> 00:27:15,436
I don't want to see you die

612
00:27:15,436 --> 00:27:17,037
at such a young age.

613
00:27:18,997 --> 00:27:19,877
I understand.

614
00:27:20,677 --> 00:27:22,397
I won't act on impulse again.

615
00:27:23,397 --> 00:27:23,797
Let's go.

616
00:27:24,356 --> 00:27:25,836
Let's go to watch the match between
Ma Hong Jun

617
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:26,596
and Ou Si Ke.

618
00:27:47,476 --> 00:27:48,877
What's that look?

619
00:27:49,716 --> 00:27:50,596
I don't know, either.

620
00:27:51,116 --> 00:27:52,157
You'll know it later.

621
00:27:53,637 --> 00:27:54,716
Who do you think will win?

622
00:27:55,277 --> 00:27:55,716
It's hard to say.

623
00:27:56,397 --> 00:27:57,397
Of course Ma Hong Jun will win.

624
00:27:58,157 --> 00:27:59,877
Support Branch Soul Masters
have no attack power at all.

625
00:28:00,716 --> 00:28:01,196
How can they fight?

626
00:28:02,797 --> 00:28:03,836
Why didn't Hu Lie Na come?

627
00:28:05,037 --> 00:28:06,157
I haven't seen her for a few days.

628
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,116
You have something to do with her?

629
00:28:09,157 --> 00:28:10,277
It's her who has something to do
with you.

630
00:28:14,356 --> 00:28:16,476
Sister Qing, you seem

631
00:28:16,476 --> 00:28:17,716
jealous.

632
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:18,797
Nonsense!

633
00:28:19,677 --> 00:28:20,196
What are you talking about?

634
00:28:20,196 --> 00:28:21,236
Who taught you all the nonsense?

635
00:28:22,557 --> 00:28:23,236
Rong Rong.

636
00:28:24,637 --> 00:28:25,476
Don't listen to her nonsense.

637
00:28:29,116 --> 00:28:30,356
Ou Si Ke, Ning Rong Rong.

638
00:28:31,316 --> 00:28:32,356
No one thinks you can win.

639
00:28:33,236 --> 00:28:34,116
Everyone thinks that

640
00:28:34,196 --> 00:28:35,917
Support Branch Soul Masters
can only assist in combat

641
00:28:36,637 --> 00:28:37,517
and can't fight independently.

642
00:28:39,596 --> 00:28:40,356
Now it's time

643
00:28:40,356 --> 00:28:41,677
to change their outdated concepts.

644
00:28:42,517 --> 00:28:44,037
Show your hard work.

645
00:28:44,716 --> 00:28:45,436
The battle begins!

646
00:29:02,316 --> 00:29:03,037
Why are you here?

647
00:29:03,757 --> 00:29:04,836
Su Yun Tao is dead.

648
00:29:05,236 --> 00:29:06,557
The chief asked me to replace him

649
00:29:07,397 --> 00:29:09,316
and watch over you to prevent you
from causing trouble.

650
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:12,356
What else did the chief say?

651
00:29:12,637 --> 00:29:13,716
I must not cause trouble, either.

652
00:29:15,436 --> 00:29:16,877
You still stay in Shi Lan Ke

653
00:29:17,116 --> 00:29:18,196
because of Mutant Soul.

654
00:29:18,277 --> 00:29:19,076
Who told you that?

655
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:20,797
The chief knows everything.

656
00:29:22,236 --> 00:29:23,956
The chief even told you about this?

657
00:29:24,917 --> 00:29:25,797
I'll find out the truth.

658
00:29:26,637 --> 00:29:27,757
But Bu Le is dead.

659
00:29:28,236 --> 00:29:28,917
The clue is gone.

660
00:29:30,637 --> 00:29:32,076
Bu Le can't be the only one

661
00:29:32,076 --> 00:29:33,277
involved in the matter of Mutant Soul.

662
00:29:35,757 --> 00:29:37,877
Do you want to expand your search?

663
00:29:38,517 --> 00:29:40,596
The Martial Soul Hall
searched the village that day

664
00:29:40,956 --> 00:29:42,356
and made enough ruckus.

665
00:29:42,877 --> 00:29:44,076
I guess they won't show up again

666
00:29:44,076 --> 00:29:45,196
in the short term.

667
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:46,677
Wait for my news.

668
00:29:47,397 --> 00:29:48,236
But the chief said...

669
00:29:48,236 --> 00:29:49,637
Wait for me to find out the truth.

670
00:29:49,637 --> 00:29:50,877
The chief will be happy.

671
00:29:59,517 --> 00:30:01,037
Have you found out who killed Su Yun Tao?

672
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:04,997
The chief is also secretly investigating

673
00:30:06,196 --> 00:30:07,397
who went to the Star Forest

674
00:30:07,397 --> 00:30:08,596
from the Martial Soul Hall recently.

675
00:30:09,436 --> 00:30:10,677
But there's no news yet.

676
00:30:12,037 --> 00:30:13,716
The one who can communicate with
Azure Bull Python

677
00:30:14,877 --> 00:30:16,236
should be a Grand Soul Land Master.

678
00:30:16,997 --> 00:30:18,596
Did that teacher from Shi Lan Ke School

679
00:30:19,076 --> 00:30:20,836
make a mistake and talk nonsense?

680
00:30:21,596 --> 00:30:22,797
I have my own judgment.

681
00:30:23,917 --> 00:30:24,436
Okay.

682
00:30:25,436 --> 00:30:26,596
I'm here to protect you.

683
00:30:26,956 --> 00:30:27,517
Next,

684
00:30:28,157 --> 00:30:29,596
do you want me to accompany you
to Shi Lan Ke?

685
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:30,517
No.

686
00:30:35,436 --> 00:30:36,917
I want you to kill someone for me.

687
00:30:38,836 --> 00:30:40,476
My mission is to protect you.

688
00:30:40,596 --> 00:30:41,917
I'm not working for you.

689
00:30:42,476 --> 00:30:42,997
Follow me.

690
00:30:59,797 --> 00:31:01,637
Young Master, someone's here to see you.

691
00:31:02,476 --> 00:31:04,076
There's no one I know
in Suo Tuo City.

692
00:31:04,877 --> 00:31:06,557
It's about your younger brother.

693
00:31:11,316 --> 00:31:11,716
Where's he?

694
00:31:12,397 --> 00:31:13,517
He's in the alley at the door.

695
00:31:13,917 --> 00:31:14,677
He won't come in.

696
00:31:15,076 --> 00:31:16,116
He insisted that you go out.

697
00:31:31,517 --> 00:31:32,997
He's my obstacle.

698
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:34,476
Kill him for me.

699
00:31:34,877 --> 00:31:36,037
Dai Wei Shi has a special identity.

700
00:31:36,517 --> 00:31:37,716
Besides, the chief said that

701
00:31:38,116 --> 00:31:39,116
I'm here to protect you only.

702
00:31:40,917 --> 00:31:42,677
You're protecting me if you kill him.

703
00:31:43,397 --> 00:31:44,076
Did he hurt you?

704
00:31:46,436 --> 00:31:48,157
He almost killed me.

705
00:31:49,037 --> 00:31:49,517
Okay.

706
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,797
Leave him to me.

707
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:53,476
Let me remind you,

708
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,116
he's very strong.

709
00:31:56,596 --> 00:31:57,277
I'm not weak.

710
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:33,476
It's not so boring at last.

711
00:32:41,236 --> 00:32:42,116
Does everyone see it?

712
00:32:43,037 --> 00:32:44,596
Never underestimate your opponent.

713
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:46,196
Master.

714
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:48,596
I lost.

715
00:32:49,956 --> 00:32:50,716
It's all right.

716
00:32:51,037 --> 00:32:51,677
Master?

717
00:32:52,677 --> 00:32:53,076
Yeah.

718
00:32:53,637 --> 00:32:55,157
I just formally became
Headmaster's disciple this morning.

719
00:32:55,917 --> 00:32:56,877
So casually?

720
00:33:01,757 --> 00:33:02,436
What?

721
00:33:02,956 --> 00:33:03,877
Didn't we make a bet?

722
00:33:04,116 --> 00:33:05,557
Two Gold Soul Coins, please.

723
00:33:05,836 --> 00:33:07,397
We're teachers,

724
00:33:07,397 --> 00:33:09,596
how can we not be their examples?

725
00:33:09,877 --> 00:33:10,917
We must not gamble.

726
00:33:11,517 --> 00:33:12,637
That's a joke.

727
00:33:16,757 --> 00:33:17,997
Okay, pay attention, everyone.

728
00:33:18,277 --> 00:33:19,517
There are two days left
before the match.

729
00:33:19,716 --> 00:33:21,436
You should focus on training from now on.

730
00:33:21,637 --> 00:33:22,797
Practice on the tactics
of a seven-man team.

731
00:33:23,757 --> 00:33:24,997
Let me confirm something
before that.

732
00:33:25,677 --> 00:33:26,436
Dai Mu Bai is the captain.

733
00:33:27,956 --> 00:33:29,076
Tang San is
a Control Branch Soul Master.

734
00:33:29,917 --> 00:33:31,436
He's responsible for tactical command
on the battlefield.

735
00:33:33,836 --> 00:33:34,356
I'm the captain.

736
00:33:34,836 --> 00:33:35,797
Why should Tang San give commands?

737
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:37,517
It's easier for
a Control Branch Soul Master

738
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:38,637
to control the overall situation.

739
00:33:38,956 --> 00:33:39,797
I can do it too.

740
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,757
I think Tang San is more suitable.

741
00:33:44,557 --> 00:33:45,956
Tang San,
the opponent is my brother.

742
00:33:46,436 --> 00:33:47,196
I want to lead the battle.

743
00:33:48,116 --> 00:33:48,757
I have no opinion.

744
00:33:50,557 --> 00:33:50,877
Okay.

745
00:33:51,637 --> 00:33:52,956
Dai Mu Bai will command
on the battlefield.

746
00:33:53,757 --> 00:33:54,677
Gather at the entrance of the village

747
00:33:54,997 --> 00:33:56,157
to prepare for the next stage
of training.

748
00:34:02,716 --> 00:34:03,196
Tang San.

749
00:34:03,677 --> 00:34:05,116
I still hope you can prepare
the tactics.

750
00:34:06,716 --> 00:34:07,037
But...

751
00:34:08,356 --> 00:34:10,076
But Brother Dai is the commander.

752
00:34:10,397 --> 00:34:12,157
What you need to prepare
is the counter-strategy

753
00:34:12,397 --> 00:34:14,196
when Dai Mu Bai fails
and the situation worsens.

754
00:34:16,077 --> 00:34:16,716
Can you do it?

755
00:34:21,037 --> 00:34:21,636
I don't know.

756
00:34:22,757 --> 00:34:24,317
Don't be nervous, think it this way.

757
00:34:24,837 --> 00:34:26,797
If you lose,
Dai Mu Bai will be over.

758
00:34:35,357 --> 00:34:36,396
I'm more nervous now.

759
00:34:37,757 --> 00:34:39,156
It's okay, you can do it.

760
00:34:58,956 --> 00:34:59,676
He's still not here.

761
00:35:00,277 --> 00:35:01,476
Could it be that he backs out because he's scared?

762
00:35:02,876 --> 00:35:03,196
He won't.

763
00:35:03,997 --> 00:35:04,757
He'll never be absent

764
00:35:05,117 --> 00:35:05,837
for the battle he started.

765
00:35:06,436 --> 00:35:06,916
But

766
00:35:07,117 --> 00:35:08,557
it's been so long now.

767
00:35:10,117 --> 00:35:10,997
If he doesn't come,

768
00:35:11,236 --> 00:35:12,236
it means he gives up, right?

769
00:35:35,317 --> 00:35:37,156
I'm sorry for being late.

770
00:35:37,876 --> 00:35:38,757
Give me some time

771
00:35:39,357 --> 00:35:40,196
to change my clothes.

772
00:35:42,317 --> 00:35:42,916
What happened?

773
00:35:44,117 --> 00:35:44,997
Who hurt you?

774
00:35:46,317 --> 00:35:47,236
It has nothing to do with you.
