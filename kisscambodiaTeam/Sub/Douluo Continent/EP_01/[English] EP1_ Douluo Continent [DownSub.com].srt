00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,000
(Wake up.)

(With your authentic self and ceaseless hope,)

16
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:23,000
(look for the deepest secret
in your heart.)

17
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,550
(Wake up.)

18
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,000
(Then, you will see your authentic self.)

19
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,030
(Then, you can reveal
the glossed-over truth.)

20
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,190
(Go through the sincere lies)

21
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,720
(to your innermost thoughts)

22
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,720
(and somewhere far away.)

23
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,910
(Maybe you will be reborn.)

24
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,080
(Maybe you will fall
into the deepest darkness.)

25
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,270
Dad.

26
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,230
The nails to be sent

27
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,000
to the village head today...

28
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,040
Dad.

29
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,880
Why are you drunk again?

30
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,640
You will catch a cold here.

31
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,920
Come on. Let me help you in.

32
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,830
Dad, easy.

33
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,600
Sit down.

34
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,070
Come on.

35
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,720
(Purple Demon Eye!)

36
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,320
(Hundred Projectiles!)

37
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,600
Where is he?

38
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,510
It is spilled all over the ground.
What's going on?

39
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,000
(I can't get rid of it.)

40
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,000
(What should I do?)

41
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,030
(I can't run back home,)

42
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,150
(or the monster will follow.)

43
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,280
(Ghostly Trace!)

44
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,000
(Since I can't get away,)

45
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,440
(I can only take the plunge.)

46
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,150
(Purple Demon Eye!)

47
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,400
(It wasn't killed.)

48
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,910
It has been blinded.

49
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,080
Did you destroy its eye?

50
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,000
(Lone Wolf Shield Body!)

51
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,710
Are you a man or a ghost?

52
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,590
I am Su Yun Tao from Martial Soul Hall.

53
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,520
My name is Tang San.

54
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,760
What's so scary?

55
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,080
Haven't you seen
Martial Soul Shield Body?

56
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,670
Thank you for saving me.

57
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,280
I have to go.

58
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,910
Where are you going?

59
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,790
I'm going to catch the spider.

60
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,710
Kid, do you know

61
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,320
the Human Faced Demon Spider
is cruel and bloodthirsty?

62
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,640
It is a frightening creature

63
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,400
among Soul Beasts.

64
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,200
You were just lucky

65
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,520
that you weren't devoured by it today.

66
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,080
Kid, don't run around

67
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,230
in the forest.

68
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,550
I'm almost a grown-up.

69
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,230
You are almost a grown-up?

70
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,670
Your Martial Soul is
not even in the waking state,

71
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,550
but you managed

72
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,000
to destroy the eye
of the Human Faced Demon Spider.

73
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,350
I just threw out a nail.

74
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,200
It moved too fast and hit it by itself.

75
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,440
Why do you carry nails with you?

76
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,200
My dad is a blacksmith.

77
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,200
Normally,

78
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,150
only Soul Masters can fight Soul Beasts.

79
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,760
It's a miracle for a boy like you

80
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,000
whose Martial Soul hasn't awakened

81
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,960
to blind a Human Faced Demon Spider.

82
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,080
I was just lucky.

83
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,440
Martial Soul is the manifestation

84
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,520
of one's inner strength.

85
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:29,710
Dad.

86
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,640
I saw a huge spider

87
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,710
in the forest today.

88
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,150
Fortunately, Mr. Su

89
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:35,790
came to my rescue.

90
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
He also gave me a book.

91
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,470
At first,

92
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,080
I thought he was strange.

93
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,470
Later, I realized

94
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,230
that we are the strangest ones.

95
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,280
Dad.

96
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,030
Do you think this book is reliable?

97
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,790
The book says

98
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,550
that everyone in the Douluo Continent

99
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,110
has Martial Soul.

100
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:53,550
Dad.

101
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,550
Have you been

102
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,520
to any places

103
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,280
beyond the Saint of Soul Village?

104
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,440
The wine is finished.

105
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,790
I'll take care of it.

106
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,200
Dad.

107
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,230
Mr. Su

108
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,400
was really amazing.

109
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,670
And he had Martial Soul.

110
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,200
His Martial Soul could transform.

111
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,280
It looked like a wolf,

112
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,280
very scary.

113
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,520
But he beat off

114
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,150
the huge spider.

115
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,880
He said he was a Soul Master.

116
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,550
Dad, do you know what a Soul Master is?

117
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,030
He also said he was

118
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,960
from Martial Soul Hall.

119
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,400
The huge spider was a Soul Beast

120
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,230
called Human Faced Demon Spider.

121
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,080
I haven't heard of it anyway.

122
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,110
But Dad,

123
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,640
I destroyed an eye

124
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,710
of that huge spider today.

125
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,440
I think

126
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,790
it is pretty good

127
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,640
to become a Soul Master like Mr. Su.

128
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,710
He was charismatic!

129
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,320
Will I have the chance

130
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,400
to be such a Soul Master

131
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,880
in the future?

132
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,000
Did you use your ability?

133
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,910
I used Purple Demon Eye, Ghostly Trace,

134
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,350
and some projectile skills.

135
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,910
Did that guy see it?

136
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,400
Dad, rest assured.

137
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,590
I assure you that he didn't see it.

138
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,400
Dad.

139
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,640
What is a Soul Beast?

140
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,590
I didn't find

141
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,790
any relevant content in the book.

142
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,400
They are fantastic animals
with Soul Ring power.

143
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,350
They can be any kind of animal.

144
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,670
Are they ferocious? Are they man-eaters?

145
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:39,230
There are good and evil people.
So are the Soul Beasts.

146
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,470
It turns out
that there are good and evil beasts.

147
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,710
Soul Beasts are not wild beasts!

148
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,000
They are

149
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,520
far more intelligent
than ordinary beasts.

150
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,030
The Soul Beasts that have lived
for more than 100,000 years

151
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,280
can change into the human form.

152
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,910
By then, there is no difference

153
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,790
between humans and them.

154
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,400
Are there many Soul Beasts
that change into the human form?

155
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,760
Soul Masters and Soul Beasts
are natural enemies.

156
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,200
Soul Masters hunt
and kill Soul Beasts endlessly.

157
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,470
It's never easy for a Soul Beast

158
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,880
to live more than 100,000 years.

159
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,320
Are you the officer

160
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,640
from Martial Soul Hall?

161
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,880
Your place

162
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,640
hasn't held
any Martial Soul Awakening Rite

163
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,840
for a long time, right?

164
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,200
The Saint of Soul Village
is relatively remote.

165
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,590
The road condition is bad.

166
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,960
It's really been a long time
without any Soul Master coming here.

167
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,030
Officer.

168
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,590
Can we have the pleasure
to have someone from Martial Soul Hall

169
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,110
to carry out
the Martial Soul Awakening Rite here?

170
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,880
I will be staying here for two days

171
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,110
to prevent the return
of the Human Faced Demon Spider.

172
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,000
I can carry out
the Martial Soul Awakening Rite.

173
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,590
Thank you, Officer.

174
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,760
I will inform the children

175
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,080
and let them come here tomorrow.

176
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,710
Okay.

177
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,910
The village is surrounded by mountains.

178
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,910
Beyond the mountains is the river.

179
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,200
Where is the river flowing?

180
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,310
To the outside world?

181
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:18,640
What does

182
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,950
the World of Martial Soul look like?

183
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,190
Maybe it is

184
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,520
not as good as Mr. Su described.

185
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,710
The Saint of Soul Village is safer.

186
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,190
There are neither Soul Beasts
nor Soul Masters.

187
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,830
Tang San!

188
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,400
Village Head?

189
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,830
Village Head, please come in.

190
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,830
I am leaving soon.

191
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,640
Long story short.

192
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,190
Come to my house

193
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,920
after you wake up tomorrow morning.

194
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,590
To repair the roof again?

195
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,110
No.

196
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,640
Officer Su Yun Tao

197
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,710
is going to carry out
the Martial Soul Awakening Rite

198
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:56,350
for us tomorrow!

199
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,920
Martial Soul

200
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,070
is like a seed

201
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,640
planted by a farmer.

202
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,590
It is planted in everyone's heart.

203
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,520
When the Martial Soul awakens,

204
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,880
the seed no longer sleeps.

205
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,880
It will be awakened!

206
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,680
And then,

207
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,160
when you have

208
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,070
the right Soul Ring one day,

209
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,280
you can become a Soul Master!

210
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,920
A Soul Master?

211
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,430
What about after becoming a Soul Master?

212
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,760
You will be respected by everyone.

213
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,920
Do you want

214
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,110
to stay here and be a nobody

215
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,590
doing chores for your whole life?

216
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,040
Should I help you to tell everyone

217
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,470
to attend the rite?

218
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,280
It can't be done

219
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,430
after a certain age.

220
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:37,800
In short,

221
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,640
you must come to my house tomorrow.

222
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,040
He is not going!

223
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,070
Dad.

224
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,040
If I

225
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,160
had held out longer today,

226
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,350
I might have been able

227
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,560
to escape by myself.

228
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,710
You don't study Xuan Tian Records

229
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,070
to make your escape,

230
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,950
but to defeat

231
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,070
all Soul Beasts and Soul Masters,

232
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,310
and become
the strongest man in Douluo Continent.

233
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,520
Dad.

234
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,640
Doesn't it sound a bit overstated?

235
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,190
Since you've already known

236
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,830
about the Martial Soul,
Soul Masters, and Soul Beasts,

237
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,430
why didn't you tell me?

238
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,000
I didn't tell you,
but you learned it anyway.

239
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,430
Have you memorized this book?

240
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,470
I have.

241
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,400
Every single word.

242
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,830
Dad, what are you doing?

243
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,040
Since someone from Martial Soul Hall

244
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,400
has come to the Saint of Soul Village,

245
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,000
I can't keep this book anymore.

246
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,590
Why?

247
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,680
Remember.

248
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:59,000
You must keep everything
about Xuan Tian Records to yourself.

249
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,760
Never tell anyone about it.

250
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,760
I remember that.

251
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,470
Dad.

252
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,110
What exactly is Xuan Tian Records about?

253
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,110
Why have you been telling me to practice it
since I was young,

254
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,350
while I can't tell others about it?

255
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:14,760
Dad.

256
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,230
Is Xuan Tian Records

257
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,400
related to my mom?

258
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:23,760
Dad.

259
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,230
No!

260
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,310
Don't eat me!

261
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,520
I'm too skinny, not yummy!

262
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,350
Don't eat me!

263
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,040
(Tang San.)

264
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,520
(Tang San.)

265
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,160
(I'm waiting for you.)

266
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,310
Why am I weeping?

267
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,110
(Tang San.)

268
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,680
Who are you?

269
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,520
(Tang San.)

270
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,950
(Tang San.)

271
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:16,680
Dad.

272
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,280
Go wash up since you are up.

273
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,400
Remember to buy me wine.

274
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,310
I had the same dream again.

275
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,680
It was still the same field of Blue Silver Plant.

276
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,680
I heard a voice

277
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,640
calling my name.

278
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,920
What else did the voice say?

279
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,950
She said she was waiting for me.

280
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,590
The voice sounded

281
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,590
especially warm and gentle.

282
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,560
Could it be my mom?

283
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,040
Ever since I practiced Xuan Tian Records,

284
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,920
I have been having the same dream.

285
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:52,950
Was it

286
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,040
my mom's voice?

287
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,880
How is Xuan Tian Records related to her?

288
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,000
You are not qualified

289
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,470
to learn about your mom yet.

290
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,160
I will tell you about it

291
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,400
when you are strong enough.

292
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,830
Why do you say that every time?

293
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,800
How strong do I have to become?

294
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,190
Keep practicing.

295
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,040
Will I become stronger
after the awakening of my Martial Soul?

296
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,680
Yes.

297
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,350
Then, I should

298
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,310
join the rite
in the village head’s house.

299
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,040
You are not allowed to go.

300
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,310
You asked me
to become stronger, didn't you?

301
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:25,430
Dad.

302
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,470
Where is
my Essential Soul Master Handbook?

303
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,560
There wasn't enough firewood,
so I burned it.

304
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,430
I'll gather some firewood later.

305
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,800
Focus on the hands.

306
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,110
It's a Tool Soul, the sickle.

307
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,350
Not too bad.

308
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,400
It is something of a weapon.

309
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,040
Withdraw it using your mind.

310
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,640
Touch it with your right hand.

311
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:49,880
Kid.

312
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,830
You have no Soul Power,
so you can't be a Soul Master.

313
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,430
Thank you, Officer.

314
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
(One can't become a Soul Master)

315
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,310
(even when he has Martial Soul?)

316
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,590
Tang San.

317
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,680
Why didn't you come in?

318
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,430
Mr. Su.

319
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,280
I thought about it all night long.

320
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,430
My dad, the village head,

321
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,070
and you

322
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:33,710
told me

323
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,800
about the World of Martial Soul

324
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,560
beyond the Saint of Soul Village.

325
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,430
But each one of you

326
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,350
told a different story.

327
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,560
Since you are eager to know,

328
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,280
you should figure it out yourself.

329
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,520
Don't you want to know

330
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,880
what your own Martial Soul

331
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,640
or your family's Martial Soul is?

332
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,680
I can also know
my family's Martial Soul?

333
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,710
Martial Soul can be inherited in the family.

334
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,830
The Martial Soul of either parent

335
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,920
will go to their offspring.

336
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,880
You didn't cower when you
confronted the Human Faced Demon Spider.

337
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,920
I can see that you are

338
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,880
strong-hearted.

339
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,070
I believe that your Martial Soul

340
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,520
may also be powerful and special.

341
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,640
So you are very likely to have

342
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,880
the potential of becoming a Soul Master.

343
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,160
Apart from becoming a Soul Master,

344
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,070
is there any other way to get stronger?

345
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,640
In Douluo Continent,

346
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,800
there are no other possibilities.

347
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,230
I want to get stronger.
I want to be a Soul Master.

348
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,760
Stretch out your right hand.

349
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,000
Blue Silver Plant?

350
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,280
How could it be Blue Silver Plant?

351
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,400
Come out.

352
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,070
Is this my Martial Soul?

353
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,280
This...

354
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,070
Blue Silver Plant

355
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,830
is the commonest useless Martial Soul.

356
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,520
It can neither attack, defend,

357
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,520
nor support.

358
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,070
A person with such a useless Martial Soul

359
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,830
can never be a Soul Master.

360
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,680
I can't get stronger anymore?

361
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,190
Since you are here,

362
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,190
take the test

363
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,310
and see how strong your Soul Power is.

364
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,430
Officer,

365
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,470
with a Martial Soul like Blue Silver Plant,

366
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,160
strong Soul Power is meaningless.

367
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,000
I know.

368
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:55,430
Come on.

369
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,230
You were born with full Soul Power?

370
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,920
You were born with full Soul Power?

371
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,040
That is one in a million.

372
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,830
Thanks for letting me know

373
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,680
what my Martial Soul is.

374
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,950
I'm quite happy about it.

375
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,590
My dad is waiting
for my return with firewood.

376
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,760
I should get going.

377
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,430
Village Head, I'm leaving.

378
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,280
Tang San.

379
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,760
Do you want to join

380
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,950
Nuoding School?

381
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,470
Don't I have a useless Martial Soul?

382
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:43,680
Why didn't you

383
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,920
go with Su Yun Tao?

384
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,800
Since you didn't agree with it, I wouldn't leave.

385
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,280
I forbid you to go
to the awakening rite,

386
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,800
but you went there anyway.

387
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,230
Dad, I know I was wrong.

388
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,800
But Mr. Su said

389
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,590
I inherited my Martial Soul

390
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,950
from you and my mom.

391
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,160
I joined the Martial Soul Awakening Rite

392
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,760
in order to know more

393
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,880
about my mom.

394
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,070
What is your Martial Soul?

395
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,470
They told me

396
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,110
it is a useless Martial Soul,

397
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,190
but I still stand a chance.

398
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,640
I can become a Soul Master

399
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,110
and attend Soul Master School.

400
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,760
You chose this path in the end.

401
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,040
I allow you to go,

402
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,760
on two conditions.

403
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,520
You can be a Soul Master,

404
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,190
but you must not join Martial Soul Hall.

405
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,430
Why?

406
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,310
Make a vow.

407
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,230
I vow

408
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,640
that even if I become a Soul Master,

409
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,470
I will never join Martial Soul Hall.

410
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,350
But Dad,

411
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,070
as they said, I've got a useless Martial Soul.

412
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,070
Make the fire stronger.

413
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,470
Aren't you curious

414
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,160
about Xuan Yu Hand's function?

415
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,920
I will tell you now.

416
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,800
Make the fire stronger.

417
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,830
Dad, does the Martial Soul

418
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,430
only manifest on the right hand?

419
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,800
I somehow felt that there was

420
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,760
something hidden in my left hand

421
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,070
when I was
at the Martial Soul Awakening Rite.

422
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,590
Spread your palm.

423
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,280
Focus.

424
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,400
Release the power in your heart.

425
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,800
Twin Martial Souls?

426
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,590
Is having Twin Martial Souls rare?

427
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,190
Make it visible.

428
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,400
Dad.

429
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,470
This is so difficult.

430
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,070
I feel that something in my heart

431
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,470
is suppressing me.

432
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,040
Release your inner strength.

433
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,070
It really is Hao Tian Hammer.

434
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,830
Hao Tian Hammer?

435
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,400
Dad.

436
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:38,110
This hammer looks ugly.

437
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,920
It's too heavy.

438
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,680
Dad, I can't hold on anymore.

439
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,590
Take it back.

440
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,920
Don't let anyone see

441
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,520
the Martial Soul in your left hand.

442
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,000
I got the hammer and Blue Silver Plant

443
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,830
from you and my mom?

444
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,590
If one day,

445
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,830
this hammer can no longer be restrained,

446
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,000
you must remember

447
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,470
that this hammer is not a tool for killing.

448
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,110
It is meant to be a guardian.

449
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,110
A guardian?

450
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,230
What does it guard?

451
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,590
It guards your right hand

452
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,640
and protects the Blue Silver Plant
in your right hand.

453
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,000
Remember.

454
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,920
In the future,

455
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,800
always protect the plant
in your right hand

456
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,430
with the hammer in your left hand.

457
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,640
Always.

458
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,280
I remember it, Dad.

459
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:31,830
Look.

460
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,800
This is the second condition.

461
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,350
You have to work this piece of iron

462
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,470
into a fine needle.

463
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,520
Then, you can leave.

464
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,520
Dad.

465
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,070
Are you exaggerating it?

466
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,190
Look at me.

467
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,040
It is too fast to be seen.

468
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,000
Use Purple Demon Eye.

469
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,470
I see it clearly.

470
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,880
The hammer

471
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,160
hits it at the same point every time.

472
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,160
It makes no mistake.

473
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,710
This is the gist of Tempering a Thousandfold.

474
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,800
Gather all your strength at one point.

475
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,560
Turn a piece of ordinary metal
into a magic weapon.

476
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,710
This is Xuan Yu Hand.

477
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,230
When you use the hammer,

478
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,110
fill your hands with Qi.

479
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,230
It turns out that Xuan Yu Hand

480
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,280
is for forging.

481
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:44,870
Dad.

482
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
Village Head, I did it!

483
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:59,190
You are leaving,
but he doesn't even see you off.

484
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,040
Actually, my dad is nice to me.

485
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,120
Nice to you?

486
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,360
He just doesn't know how to express it.

487
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,560
Okay, we'd better hurry.

488
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,710
We have to travel across the mountains.

489
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:11,910
Come on.

490
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,630
(Never let anyone see)

491
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,600
(the hammer in your left hand.)

492
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,630
(Never mention Xuan Tian Records)

493
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,390
(to anyone.)

494
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,080
(You have to walk on your own.)

495
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:38,760
What's wrong?

496
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,360
I forgot to bring the nails.
