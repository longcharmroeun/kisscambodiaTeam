00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,000
(Wake up.)

(With your authentic self and ceaseless hope,)

16
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,000
(look for the deepest secret
in your heart.)

17
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,550
(Wake up.)

18
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,000
(Then, you will see your authentic self.)

19
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,030
(Then, you can reveal
the glossed-over truth.)

20
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,190
(Go through the sincere lies)

21
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,720
(to your innermost thoughts)

22
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,720
(and somewhere far away.)

23
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,910
(Maybe you will be reborn.)

24
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,080
(Maybe you will fall
into the deepest darkness.)

25
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,270
Dad.

26
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,230
The nails to be sent

27
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,000
to the village head today...

28
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,040
Dad.

29
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,880
Why are you drunk again?

30
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,640
You will catch a cold here.

31
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,920
Come on. Let me help you in.

32
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,830
Dad, easy.

33
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,600
Sit down.

34
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,070
Come on.

35
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
(Purple Demon Eye!)

36
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,320
(Hundred Projectiles!)

37
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,600
Where is he?

38
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,510
It is spilled all over the ground.
What's going on?

39
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,000
(I can't get rid of it.)

40
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,000
(What should I do?)

41
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,030
(I can't run back home,)

42
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,150
(or the monster will follow.)

43
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,280
(Ghostly Trace!)

44
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,000
(Since I can't get away,)

45
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,440
(I can only take the plunge.)

46
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,150
(Purple Demon Eye!)

47
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,400
(It wasn't killed.)

48
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,910
It has been blinded.

49
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,080
Did you destroy its eye?

50
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,000
(Lone Wolf Shield Body!)

51
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,710
Are you a man or a ghost?

52
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,590
I am Su Yun Tao from Martial Soul Hall.

53
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,520
My name is Tang San.

54
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,760
What's so scary?

55
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,080
Haven't you seen
Martial Soul Shield Body?

56
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,670
Thank you for saving me.

57
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,280
I have to go.

58
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:51,910
Where are you going?

59
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,790
I'm going to catch the spider.

60
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,710
Kid, do you know

61
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,320
the Human Faced Demon Spider
is cruel and bloodthirsty?

62
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,640
It is a frightening creature

63
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,400
among Soul Beasts.

64
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,200
You were just lucky

65
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,520
that you weren't devoured by it today.

66
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,080
Kid, don't run around

67
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,230
in the forest.

68
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,550
I'm almost a grown-up.

69
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,230
You are almost a grown-up?

70
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,670
Your Martial Soul is
not even in the waking state,

71
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,550
but you managed

72
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,000
to destroy the eye
of the Human Faced Demon Spider.

73
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,350
I just threw out a nail.

74
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,200
It moved too fast and hit it by itself.

75
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,440
Why do you carry nails with you?

76
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,200
My dad is a blacksmith.

77
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,200
Normally,

78
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,150
only Soul Masters can fight Soul Beasts.

79
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,760
It's a miracle for a boy like you

80
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,000
whose Martial Soul hasn't awakened

81
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,960
to blind a Human Faced Demon Spider.

82
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:58,080
I was just lucky.

83
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,440
Martial Soul is the manifestation

84
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,520
of one's inner strength.

85
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,710
Dad.

86
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,640
I saw a huge spider

87
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,710
in the forest today.

88
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,150
Fortunately, Mr. Su

89
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,790
came to my rescue.

90
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
He also gave me a book.

91
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,470
At first,

92
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,080
I thought he was strange.

93
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,470
Later, I realized

94
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,230
that we are the strangest ones.

95
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,280
Dad.

96
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,030
Do you think this book is reliable?

97
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,790
The book says

98
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,550
that everyone in the Douluo Continent

99
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,110
has Martial Soul.

100
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,550
Dad.

101
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,550
Have you been

102
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,520
to any places

103
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,280
beyond the Saint of Soul Village?

104
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,440
The wine is finished.

105
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,790
I'll take care of it.

106
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,200
Dad.

107
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,230
Mr. Su

108
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,400
was really amazing.

109
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,670
And he had Martial Soul.

110
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,200
His Martial Soul could transform.

111
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,280
It looked like a wolf,

112
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,280
very scary.

113
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,520
But he beat off

114
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,150
the huge spider.

115
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,880
He said he was a Soul Master.

116
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,550
Dad, do you know what a Soul Master is?

117
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,030
He also said he was

118
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,960
from Martial Soul Hall.

119
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,400
The huge spider was a Soul Beast

120
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,230
called Human Faced Demon Spider.

121
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,080
I haven't heard of it anyway.

122
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,110
But Dad,

123
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,640
I destroyed an eye

124
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,710
of that huge spider today.

125
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,440
I think

126
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,790
it is pretty good

127
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,640
to become a Soul Master like Mr. Su.

128
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,710
He was charismatic!

129
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,320
Will I have the chance

130
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,400
to be such a Soul Master

131
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,880
in the future?

132
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,000
Did you use your ability?

133
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,910
I used Purple Demon Eye, Ghostly Trace,

134
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,350
and some projectile skills.

135
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,910
Did that guy see it?

136
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,400
Dad, rest assured.

137
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,590
I assure you that he didn't see it.

138
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,400
Dad.

139
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,640
What is a Soul Beast?

140
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,590
I didn't find

141
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,790
any relevant content in the book.

142
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,400
They are fantastic animals
with Soul Ring power.

143
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,350
They can be any kind of animal.

144
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,670
Are they ferocious? Are they man-eaters?

145
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,230
There are good and evil people.
So are the Soul Beasts.

146
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,470
It turns out
that there are good and evil beasts.

147
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,710
Soul Beasts are not wild beasts!

148
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,000
They are

149
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,520
far more intelligent
than ordinary beasts.

150
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,030
The Soul Beasts that have lived
for more than 100,000 years

151
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,280
can change into the human form.

152
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,910
By then, there is no difference

153
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,790
between humans and them.

154
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,400
Are there many Soul Beasts
that change into the human form?

155
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,760
Soul Masters and Soul Beasts
are natural enemies.

156
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,200
Soul Masters hunt
and kill Soul Beasts endlessly.

157
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,470
It's never easy for a Soul Beast

158
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,880
to live more than 100,000 years.

159
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,320
Are you the officer

160
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,640
from Martial Soul Hall?

161
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,880
Your place

162
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,640
hasn't held
any Martial Soul Awakening Rite

163
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,840
for a long time, right?

164
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,200
The Saint of Soul Village
is relatively remote.

165
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,590
The road condition is bad.

166
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,960
It's really been a long time
without any Soul Master coming here.

167
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,030
Officer.

168
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,590
Can we have the pleasure
to have someone from Martial Soul Hall

169
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,110
to carry out
the Martial Soul Awakening Rite here?

170
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,880
I will be staying here for two days

171
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,110
to prevent the return
of the Human Faced Demon Spider.

172
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,000
I can carry out
the Martial Soul Awakening Rite.

173
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,590
Thank you, Officer.

174
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,760
I will inform the children

175
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,080
and let them come here tomorrow.

176
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,710
Okay.

177
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,910
The village is surrounded by mountains.

178
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,910
Beyond the mountains is the river.

179
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,200
Where is the river flowing?

180
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,310
To the outside world?

181
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:13,640
What does

182
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,950
the World of Martial Soul look like?

183
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,190
Maybe it is

184
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,520
not as good as Mr. Su described.

185
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,710
The Saint of Soul Village is safer.

186
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,190
There are neither Soul Beasts
nor Soul Masters.

187
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,830
Tang San!

188
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,400
Village Head?

189
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,830
Village Head, please come in.

190
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,830
I am leaving soon.

191
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,640
Long story short.

192
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,190
Come to my house

193
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,920
after you wake up tomorrow morning.

194
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,590
To repair the roof again?

195
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,110
No.

196
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,640
Officer Su Yun Tao

197
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,710
is going to carry out
the Martial Soul Awakening Rite

198
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:51,350
for us tomorrow!

199
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,920
Martial Soul

200
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,070
is like a seed

201
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,640
planted by a farmer.

202
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,590
It is planted in everyone's heart.

203
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,520
When the Martial Soul awakens,

204
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,880
the seed no longer sleeps.

205
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,880
It will be awakened!

206
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,680
And then,

207
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,160
when you have

208
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,070
the right Soul Ring one day,

209
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,280
you can become a Soul Master!

210
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,920
A Soul Master?

211
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,430
What about after becoming a Soul Master?

212
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,760
You will be respected by everyone.

213
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:20,920
Do you want

214
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,110
to stay here and be a nobody

215
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,590
doing chores for your whole life?

216
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,040
Should I help you to tell everyone

217
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,470
to attend the rite?

218
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,280
It can't be done

219
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,430
after a certain age.

220
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:32,800
In short,

221
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,640
you must come to my house tomorrow.

222
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,040
He is not going!

223
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,070
Dad.

224
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,040
If I

225
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,160
had held out longer today,

226
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,350
I might have been able

227
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,560
to escape by myself.

228
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,710
You don't study Xuan Tian Records

229
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,070
to make your escape,

230
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,950
but to defeat

231
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,070
all Soul Beasts and Soul Masters,

232
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,310
and become
the strongest man in Douluo Continent.

233
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,520
Dad.

234
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,640
Doesn't it sound a bit overstated?

235
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,190
Since you've already known

236
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,830
about the Martial Soul,
Soul Masters, and Soul Beasts,

237
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,430
why didn't you tell me?

238
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,000
I didn't tell you,
but you learned it anyway.

239
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,430
Have you memorized this book?

240
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,470
I have.

241
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,400
Every single word.

242
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,830
Dad, what are you doing?

243
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,040
Since someone from Martial Soul Hall

244
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,400
has come to the Saint of Soul Village,

245
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,000
I can't keep this book anymore.

246
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,590
Why?

247
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,680
Remember.

248
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,000
You must keep everything
about Xuan Tian Records to yourself.

249
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,760
Never tell anyone about it.

250
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:57,760
I remember that.

251
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,470
Dad.

252
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,110
What exactly is Xuan Tian Records about?

253
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,110
Why have you been telling me to practice it
since I was young,

254
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,350
while I can't tell others about it?

255
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:09,760
Dad.

256
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,230
Is Xuan Tian Records

257
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,400
related to my mom?

258
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:18,760
Dad.

259
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,230
No!

260
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,310
Don't eat me!

261
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,520
I'm too skinny, not yummy!

262
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,350
Don't eat me!

263
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,040
(Tang San.)

264
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,520
(Tang San.)

265
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,160
(I'm waiting for you.)

266
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,310
Why am I weeping?

267
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,110
(Tang San.)

268
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,680
Who are you?

269
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,520
(Tang San.)

270
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,950
(Tang San.)

271
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:11,680
Dad.

272
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,280
Go wash up since you are up.

273
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,400
Remember to buy me wine.

274
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,310
I had the same dream again.

275
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,680
It was still the same field of Blue Silver Plant.

276
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,680
I heard a voice

277
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,640
calling my name.

278
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,920
What else did the voice say?

279
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,950
She said she was waiting for me.

280
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,590
The voice sounded

281
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,590
especially warm and gentle.

282
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,560
Could it be my mom?

283
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,040
Ever since I practiced Xuan Tian Records,

284
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,920
I have been having the same dream.

285
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:47,950
Was it

286
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,040
my mom's voice?

287
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,880
How is Xuan Tian Records related to her?

288
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,000
You are not qualified

289
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,470
to learn about your mom yet.

290
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,160
I will tell you about it

291
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,400
when you are strong enough.

292
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,830
Why do you say that every time?

293
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,800
How strong do I have to become?

294
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,190
Keep practicing.

295
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,040
Will I become stronger
after the awakening of my Martial Soul?

296
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:07,680
Yes.

297
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,350
Then, I should

298
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,310
join the rite
in the village head’s house.

299
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,040
You are not allowed to go.

300
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,310
You asked me
to become stronger, didn't you?

301
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:20,430
Dad.

302
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,470
Where is
my Essential Soul Master Handbook?

303
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,560
There wasn't enough firewood,
so I burned it.

304
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,430
I'll gather some firewood later.

305
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,800
Focus on the hands.

306
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,110
It's a Tool Soul, the sickle.

307
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,350
Not too bad.

308
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,400
It is something of a weapon.

309
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,040
Withdraw it using your mind.

310
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,640
Touch it with your right hand.

311
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:44,880
Kid.

312
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,830
You have no Soul Power,
so you can't be a Soul Master.

313
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,430
Thank you, Officer.

314
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
(One can't become a Soul Master)

315
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,310
(even when he has Martial Soul?)

316
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,590
Tang San.

317
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,680
Why didn't you come in?

318
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,430
Mr. Su.

319
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,280
I thought about it all night long.

320
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,430
My dad, the village head,

321
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,070
and you

322
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:28,710
told me

323
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,800
about the World of Martial Soul

324
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,560
beyond the Saint of Soul Village.

325
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,430
But each one of you

326
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,350
told a different story.

327
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,560
Since you are eager to know,

328
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,280
you should figure it out yourself.

329
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,520
Don't you want to know

330
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,880
what your own Martial Soul

331
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,640
or your family's Martial Soul is?

332
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,680
I can also know
my family's Martial Soul?

333
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,710
Martial Soul can be inherited in the family.

334
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,830
The Martial Soul of either parent

335
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,920
will go to their offspring.

336
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,880
You didn't cower when you
confronted the Human Faced Demon Spider.

337
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,920
I can see that you are

338
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,880
strong-hearted.

339
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,070
I believe that your Martial Soul

340
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,520
may also be powerful and special.

341
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,640
So you are very likely to have

342
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,880
the potential of becoming a Soul Master.

343
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,160
Apart from becoming a Soul Master,

344
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,070
is there any other way to get stronger?

345
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,640
In Douluo Continent,

346
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,800
there are no other possibilities.

347
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,230
I want to get stronger.
I want to be a Soul Master.

348
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,760
Stretch out your right hand.

349
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,000
Blue Silver Plant?

350
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,280
How could it be Blue Silver Plant?

351
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,400
Come out.

352
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,070
Is this my Martial Soul?

353
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,280
This...

354
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,070
Blue Silver Plant

355
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,830
is the commonest useless Martial Soul.

356
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,520
It can neither attack, defend,

357
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,520
nor support.

358
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,070
A person with such a useless Martial Soul

359
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,830
can never be a Soul Master.

360
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,680
I can't get stronger anymore?

361
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,190
Since you are here,

362
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,190
take the test

363
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,310
and see how strong your Soul Power is.

364
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,430
Officer,

365
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,470
with a Martial Soul like Blue Silver Plant,

366
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,160
strong Soul Power is meaningless.

367
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,000
I know.

368
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,430
Come on.

369
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,230
You were born with full Soul Power?

370
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,920
You were born with full Soul Power?

371
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,040
That is one in a million.

372
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,830
Thanks for letting me know

373
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,680
what my Martial Soul is.

374
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,950
I'm quite happy about it.

375
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,590
My dad is waiting
for my return with firewood.

376
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,760
I should get going.

377
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,430
Village Head, I'm leaving.

378
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,280
Tang San.

379
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,760
Do you want to join

380
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,950
Nuoding School?

381
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,470
Don't I have a useless Martial Soul?

382
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:38,680
Why didn't you

383
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,920
go with Su Yun Tao?

384
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,800
Since you didn't agree with it, I wouldn't leave.

385
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,280
I forbid you to go
to the awakening rite,

386
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,800
but you went there anyway.

387
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,230
Dad, I know I was wrong.

388
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,800
But Mr. Su said

389
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,590
I inherited my Martial Soul

390
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,950
from you and my mom.

391
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,160
I joined the Martial Soul Awakening Rite

392
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,760
in order to know more

393
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,880
about my mom.

394
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,070
What is your Martial Soul?

395
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,470
They told me

396
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,110
it is a useless Martial Soul,

397
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,190
but I still stand a chance.

398
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,640
I can become a Soul Master

399
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,110
and attend Soul Master School.

400
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,760
You chose this path in the end.

401
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,040
I allow you to go,

402
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,760
on two conditions.

403
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,520
You can be a Soul Master,

404
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,190
but you must not join Martial Soul Hall.

405
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,430
Why?

406
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,310
Make a vow.

407
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,230
I vow

408
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,640
that even if I become a Soul Master,

409
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,470
I will never join Martial Soul Hall.

410
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,350
But Dad,

411
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,070
as they said, I've got a useless Martial Soul.

412
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,070
Make the fire stronger.

413
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,470
Aren't you curious

414
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,160
about Xuan Yu Hand's function?

415
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,920
I will tell you now.

416
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,800
Make the fire stronger.

417
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,830
Dad, does the Martial Soul

418
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,430
only manifest on the right hand?

419
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,800
I somehow felt that there was

420
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,760
something hidden in my left hand

421
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,070
when I was
at the Martial Soul Awakening Rite.

422
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,590
Spread your palm.

423
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,280
Focus.

424
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,400
Release the power in your heart.

425
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,800
Twin Martial Souls?

426
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,590
Is having Twin Martial Souls rare?

427
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,190
Make it visible.

428
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,400
Dad.

429
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,470
This is so difficult.

430
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,070
I feel that something in my heart

431
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,470
is suppressing me.

432
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,040
Release your inner strength.

433
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,070
It really is Hao Tian Hammer.

434
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,830
Hao Tian Hammer?

435
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,400
Dad.

436
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:33,110
This hammer looks ugly.

437
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,920
It's too heavy.

438
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,680
Dad, I can't hold on anymore.

439
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,590
Take it back.

440
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:45,920
Don't let anyone see

441
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,520
the Martial Soul in your left hand.

442
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,000
I got the hammer and Blue Silver Plant

443
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,830
from you and my mom?

444
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,590
If one day,

445
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,830
this hammer can no longer be restrained,

446
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,000
you must remember

447
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,470
that this hammer is not a tool for killing.

448
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,110
It is meant to be a guardian.

449
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,110
A guardian?

450
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,230
What does it guard?

451
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,590
It guards your right hand

452
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,640
and protects the Blue Silver Plant
in your right hand.

453
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,000
Remember.

454
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,920
In the future,

455
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,800
always protect the plant
in your right hand

456
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,430
with the hammer in your left hand.

457
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,640
Always.

458
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:23,280
I remember it, Dad.

459
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:26,830
Look.

460
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,800
This is the second condition.

461
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,350
You have to work this piece of iron

462
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,470
into a fine needle.

463
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,520
Then, you can leave.

464
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,520
Dad.

465
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,070
Are you exaggerating it?

466
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,190
Look at me.

467
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,040
It is too fast to be seen.

468
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,000
Use Purple Demon Eye.

469
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,470
I see it clearly.

470
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,880
The hammer

471
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,160
hits it at the same point every time.

472
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,160
It makes no mistake.

473
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,710
This is the gist of Tempering a Thousandfold.

474
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,800
Gather all your strength at one point.

475
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,560
Turn a piece of ordinary metal
into a magic weapon.

476
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,710
This is Xuan Yu Hand.

477
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,230
When you use the hammer,

478
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,110
fill your hands with Qi.

479
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,230
It turns out that Xuan Yu Hand

480
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,280
is for forging.

481
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:39,870
Dad.

482
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,600
Village Head, I did it!

483
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:54,190
You are leaving,
but he doesn't even see you off.

484
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,040
Actually, my dad is nice to me.

485
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,120
Nice to you?

486
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,360
He just doesn't know how to express it.

487
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,560
Okay, we'd better hurry.

488
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,710
We have to travel across the mountains.

489
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:06,910
Come on.

490
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,630
(Never let anyone see)

491
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,600
(the hammer in your left hand.)

492
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,630
(Never mention Xuan Tian Records)

493
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,390
(to anyone.)

494
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,080
(You have to walk on your own.)

495
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,760
What's wrong?

496
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,360
I forgot to bring the nails.
