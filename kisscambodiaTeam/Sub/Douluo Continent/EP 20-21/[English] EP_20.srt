=Episode 20=

14
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,390
What happened?

15
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,630
Who did that to you?

16
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,710
It has nothing to do with you.

17
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,510
You'd better figure out

18
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,430
how to beg for mercy after being
beaten up by me.

19
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,790
Find me a shirt.

20
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,110
Okay. This way, please.

21
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,790
Wait for me on the stage.

22
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,950
Is he sure that he can fight?

23
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,870
Brother Dai, are you sure he
still can fight?

24
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,430
Get on the stage.

25
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,790
Let's go.

26
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,550
Young Master, it's better that you
quit the battle now.

27
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,430
Shut up. Bring me my shirt.

28
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:48,830
Yes.

29
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,350
He has suffered from a serious injury.

30
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,750
We should be able to win this time.

31
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,630
Not sure.

32
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,310
Once the battle begins, Ning Rong Rong
performs Support Branch Martial Soul.

33
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,550
Tang San uses Blue Silver Plant to
control his movement.

34
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,790
And the rest take turns to
attack him with me.

35
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,110
Don't give him a break.

36
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,830
Act quickly to end the battle.

37
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,430
But he is your brother.

38
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:20,910
He was injured.

39
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:21,870
That's too harsh.

40
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,550
I am the commander.

41
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,350
I will conduct all the moves.

42
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,870
Brother Dai. Brother Dai.

43
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,750
How about me?

44
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,310
Wait for us down there. Prepare
to treat at any time.

45
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,950
Are both of us not joining the fight?

46
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,030
Support Branch Soul Masters
don't have to fight.

47
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,190
But we have prepared it for so long.

48
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:36,750
That's right.

49
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,950
He is here.

50
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:40,870
He is here.

51
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,630
Ou Si Ke, give me one sausage.

52
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,550
The fight hasn't even started yet and
you already feel hungry?

53
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,590
Full Recovery Big Sausage!

54
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:14,670
Here you are.

55
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,750
Thanks.

56
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:19,870
Take this.

57
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,470
What do you mean? Trying to bribe me?

58
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,390
Or do you want to surrender?

59
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,030
This is the Soul Skill of Ou Si Ke.

60
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,590
Your Soul Power will recover
after eating this.

61
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,790
Since this is a Soul Battle,

62
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,910
we Seven Devils will do it
fair and square.

63
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,510
Otherwise, others might think we're
taking advantage of you.

64
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,270
And we don't hope to win in a
one-sided battle.

65
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,110
Win?

66
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,390
You're overconfident.

67
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,230
I don't have to utilize the full power

68
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,270
fighting with all of you.

69
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:55,910
Ready?

70
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,870
Yes!

71
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,270
Let's go!

72
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,550
Mutated Martial Soul?

73
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,430
Attack again.

74
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,950
Zhu Zhu Qing.

75
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,190
Take the sausage.
Regain your Soul Power.

76
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,510
Give me one too.

77
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,510
Are you injured?

78
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,590
No. I'm hungry.

79
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,070
But it is for Soul recovery.

80
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,950
It is not a snack.

81
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,550
Let it be.

82
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,390
You don't have anything else to do anyway.

83
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,590
That's so irritating.

84
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,990
It makes me feel like we are
not part of them.

85
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,630
That's why I said.
What's the point of being a Soul Master?

86
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,030
Attack again.

87
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,710
I think it is no use to attack head-on.

88
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,550
Keep attacking.

89
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,550
Do you feel hungry or want to recover?

90
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,550
We won't win fighting that way.

91
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,510
What should we do?

92
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,830
We need to come up with a tactic.

93
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,990
What can we do?

94
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,390
Yeah. What can we do?

95
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,510
Five of them can't even wear him down.

96
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,150
What's the use of adding both of us?

97
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,670
I have an idea now.

98
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,670
I need your cooperation.

99
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,510
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Failure is not a big deal.

100
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,590
Tell us.

101
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,510
How are we gonna do it?

102
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,590
He couldn't take it anymore.
Increase in speed.

103
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,910
All of you are too weak.

104
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:16,750
You lose.

105
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,070
Sister Qing.

106
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,110
Is there any point

107
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,390
to continue the fight?

108
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,950
As promised.

109
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,430
You need to go with me if you lose.

110
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,910
Seven versus one. We are not yet done.

111
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,190
What can the three of you do?

112
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:53,790
And both of us too.

113
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,230
You are just Support Branch Soul Masters.
Do you want to join the fight?

114
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,270
I will leave it to you both.

115
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,630
What is this?

116
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,590
Props.

117
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,070
What?

118
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,230
Props for magic shows.
You never saw that?

119
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:02,870
Ridiculous.

120
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:07,790
Ma Hong Jun.

121
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,150
Martial Soul bursts in a sudden.

122
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,070
You are just betting the farm.

123
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,030
Done playing?

124
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,350
That's enough!

125
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,670
Wu.

126
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,510
Speed Boost. Strength Boost.

127
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,230
Good idea. Anymore?

128
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,230
No more.

129
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,310
We shall end the fight then.

130
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,910
Yes. You lost.

131
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,190
I lost?

132
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,950
When battling in the Soul Arena,

133
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,150
those who step out of the
arena lose the fight.

134
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,350
First, we use props to attract
your attention.

135
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,830
Then, I use my Blue Silver Plant
to control your movement.

136
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,910
Lastly, Wu kicks you out of
the arena.

137
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,070
You use all the tricks

138
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,350
to force me to step out of the arena?

139
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,270
That's right.

140
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,030
The purpose of diverting your attention
and releasing the smoke bomb

141
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,390
is to kick you out of the arena.

142
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,310
According to strength, you lost.

143
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,670
According to the rules, you lost.

144
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,510
Okay. You can stay.

145
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,670
Let's meet again in Martial Soul City.

146
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,950
Wait. Martial Soul City?

147
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,630
Let's meet in the grand final

148
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,110
of Douluo Continent Soul Master
School Contest.

149
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,550
What contest?

150
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,750
Soul Master School Contest?

151
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,230
The teamwork just now,

152
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,590
did all of you ever practice it?

153
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,150
We find you before when we
practice together.

154
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,070
But...

155
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,470
I know.

156
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,590
I always thought that

157
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,310
Support branch Soul Masters

158
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,390
shouldn't join a battle.

159
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,950
So I didn't think much about it.

160
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,230
I was running out of ideas just now.

161
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,350
So I planned to give it a try.

162
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,390
I'm sorry.

163
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,670
I know you are supposed to be the
commander.

164
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,310
You can blame me if you're
not satisfied.

165
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,430
Master.

166
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,230
I'm the one who let Tang San and others
practice tactical exercise.

167
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,030
Dai Mu Bai.

168
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,830
Being strong is not only about power.

169
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,790
It can be the techniques and brain.

170
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,350
I started to doubt

171
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,590
whether my insistence

172
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,670
is a mistake.

173
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,110
Why do you think that way?

174
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,950
I always believe that

175
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,350
a Soul Master needs to have absolute
power to win.

176
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,510
But after experiencing what
happened today,

177
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,910
I'm not sure whether
my thought was right anymore.

178
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,310
Your Soul Skill is White Tiger.

179
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,910
Placing power as a priority is
not a mistake.

180
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,750
But you can't depend solely on power.

181
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,550
Battle requires the techniques.

182
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,550
You have to defeat the opponent with minimal

183
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,310
damage and loss.

184
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,590
Isn't that better?

185
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,350
I never thought about that before.

186
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,430
What I learned since I was a kid

187
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,110
is to win whatever the cost is.

188
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,110
The loser doesn't have the right to speak,

189
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,270
nor the right to survive.

190
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,510
That's why you're so
desperate for power.

191
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,030
Yes. At the Rose Inn,

192
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,870
Tang San defeated Mr. Zhao with
his strange tricks.

193
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,510
I feel so irritated.

194
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,270
Because he broke my rules.

195
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,630
Human is alive but rules are not.

196
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,550
You shouldn't be limited by rules.

197
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,070
A few days ago, Ning Rong Rong
and Ou Si Ke

198
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,390
defeated Ma Hong Jun together.

199
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,310
I thought that's because they
have been lucky enough.

200
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,230
But in today's battle,

201
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,870
I saw everyone helping each other.

202
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,630
Then I realized that as a team,

203
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,070
cooperation is the most important thing.

204
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,350
Master, as the leader of Si Lan Ke,

205
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,910
do you think I'm not good at giving commands?

206
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,230
Your frontal attack is the most powerful

207
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,510
among the seven of you.

208
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,230
Although you are good at the
sneak attack,

209
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,790
in an excellent team,

210
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,230
the Power Attack Soul Master
is the core.

211
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,070
The Support branch Soul Master is the base.

212
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,950
The Sensitivity Soul Master
is the eyes.

213
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,790
And the Controlling Soul Master

214
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:08,990
is the Soul.

215
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,310
I got it.

216
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,310
From now on, the commander of Si Lan Ke

217
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,710
is Tang San.

218
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:22,830
He can do better than me.

219
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,950
No. I'll just give commands
on the battlefield.

220
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,230
But you are the leader.

221
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,910
The leader of Si Lan Ke Seven Devils

222
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,110
will always be Brother Dai.

223
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,470
You are a man. Come on.

224
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,070
I can finally join the battle.

225
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,270
And we won.

226
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,430
Frankly speaking,

227
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,710
I... Since...

228
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,310
From the moment I knew I'm

229
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:02,950
a Support branch Soul Master,

230
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,350
I felt that I couldn't go up the stage,

231
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,790
and I could only stand at the side.

232
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,590
But today I proved to myself that

233
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,510
I'm a man.

234
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,990
Glad that you know you're a man.

235
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,110
Stop crying. You're already ugly.

236
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,390
Crying makes you more ugly.

237
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:17,830
What are you talking about?

238
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,310
Wasn't I cool on the stage?

239
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:21,750
I look handsome, right?

240
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,990
Thanks for the help just now.

241
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:28,950
We are teammates.

242
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:33,830
Wu.

243
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,550
Does your leg still hurt?

244
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,430
Ou Si Ke's Martial Soul can help me
to regain my energy.

245
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,870
But I still have to take
good care of my injury.

246
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,150
It's okay. It will be fine
after two days.

247
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,270
I'll carry you.

248
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,750
I might be heavy for you.

249
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,270
Come.

250
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,670
How do you feel?

251
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,710
Not heavy at all.

252
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,550
Are you okay?

253
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,670
Now I find that you're a
little bit heavy.

254
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,190
I'm all right.

255
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,230
Let me down now.

256
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,470
I was lying. You're not heavy at all.

257
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,790
Tang San has learned to tell lies.

258
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:06,510
Tell me. Tell me.

259
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,630
Wasn't I stunning?

260
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,030
When I called you

261
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,710
and we cooperated well, wasn't that cool?

262
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:11,670
Yes.

263
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,070
Wu. Hold my ears.

264
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,630
From now on,

265
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,750
when you pull my left ear,
I will go to the left.

266
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,710
When you pull the right one,
I will go to the right.

267
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,030
But will that hurt your ears?

268
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,070
Let's try it.

269
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,710
How do you feel? Interesting?

270
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,150
Interesting.

271
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:32,870
Let me carry you.

272
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:33,710
Does your leg still hurt?

273
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:34,470
Not anymore.

274
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,110
Go away.

275
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:36,790
Let's try.

276
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,350
What happened?

277
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,230
Someone is following us.

278
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,790
Since when?

279
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,510
Since we battled in the arena.

280
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,750
Was it not enough to watch during the fight?

281
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,670
Uncle. It's been a long time
since we last met.

282
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,110
You have been hurt badly.

283
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,670
Dai Wei Shi might hide his strength.

284
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,550
He is too powerful for me.

285
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,870
And you can't make it too overt.

286
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,270
Quickly go back to treat your injuries.
Use the remaining time to recover.

287
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:21,750
One more thing.

288
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,910
I saw Yu Tian Heng from

289
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:24,790
Tian Dou Imperial School.

290
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,310
I guess he also comes for those people
from Shi Lan Ke.

291
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,230
Things are getting interesting.

292
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,550
Stop touching it. Drink some water.

293
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,270
Your wounds are still swelling.

294
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,990
It must have been hurt badly.

295
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,510
These few days

296
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,230
you must rest properly.
Do you hear me?

297
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,550
So jealous of you.
I want to get some rest too.

298
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,150
I'm tired too.

299
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,270
You don't need that.
You don't have any injuries.

300
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,110
I walked back here yesterday.

301
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:15,190
Wu was carried by Tang San
along the way.

302
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,830
If you asked for it,

303
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,230
I'm sure Ou Si Ke would carry you too.

304
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,710
I don't need that.

305
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,110
He cried and laughed non-stop along
the way yesterday.

306
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:22,870
Nobody noticed that.

307
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,030
He was like a weirdo.

308
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,830
But he keeps protecting you.

309
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,430
So what?

310
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,550
It means that he likes you.

311
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,190
Then do you like

312
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,070
Brother Dai too?

313
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,670
What are you talking about?

314
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,070
Last night in the arena,

315
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,270
you were attacked

316
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,310
for trying to save Brother Dai.

317
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,990
You were protecting him all the time.

318
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,310
That indicates that you like him too.

319
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,590
Wu was right.

320
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,070
I helped him because he is my teammate.

321
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,870
Really? But I can see

322
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,710
you are blushing.

323
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:54,510
I feel hot.

324
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,110
Hot?

325
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,350
But we don't feel it.

326
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,190
Yeah.

327
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,390
I feel hot and also hungry.

328
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,710
Come. Let's get some food.

329
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,550
Stay here and wait for us.

330
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,550
I want to go too.

331
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,270
Wu.

332
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,230
If I am killed by her...

333
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:05,430
Let's go.

334
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,510
You must take revenge for me!

335
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,190
Slowly.

336
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:14,430
Wu.

337
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:15,550
Tang San.

338
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:18,670
Let me put on the medicine for you.

339
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,630
Did you buy it from Suo Tuo City
early in the morning?

340
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,270
If you can get better quickly,

341
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,710
I will feel relieved.

342
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:29,390
Come.

343
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,590
It might hurt a little bit.

344
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,910
Try to endure it.

345
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:37,550
Does it hurt?

346
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:38,990
I will do it gently.

347
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:50,990
It seems that it doesn't hurt that much

348
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:51,830
when I am staring at you.

349
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,590
Keep staring at me then.

350
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,190
Because I'm your brother.

351
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:56,510
Brother.

352
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:57,430
You.

353
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,510
You only call me that when
nobody around.

354
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:01,510
I didn't.

355
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,310
Can you help me braid my hair too?

356
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,950
Wait a second. Let me dress
your wounds first.

357
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,990
Let's eat later.

358
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,270
Wu.

359
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:55,670
You're back.

360
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:57,470
Tang San.

361
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,390
What are you both doing?

362
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,070
Braiding hair.

363
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:03,810
You let him braid your hair?

364
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:05,710
Anything wrong with that?

365
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:06,910
Yeah. Anything wrong?

366
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,910
Girls can't simply let a guy
braid their hair.

367
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,630
But I'm her brother.

368
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,390
Yeah. He is my brother.

369
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,310
Wu. I'm done.

370
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,150
Your braiding skill is the best.

371
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:21,630
He is smiling.

372
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,510
Take care of your wounds.
Don't move around.

373
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,070
Thanks for helping me
take care of Wu.

374
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,150
I'll take my leave now.

375
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:30,950
It's our duty.

376
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,670
Why?

377
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,070
Why?

378
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,150
We are supposed to ask you that.

379
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,190
What are you talking about?

380
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,310
Don't you feel it strange?

381
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,670
Yeah. You're very strange.

382
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,830
How does that have anything
to do with me?

383
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:52,710
I meant you.

384
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:53,830
What's wrong with me?

385
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,630
Tang San often helps you braid your hair?

386
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,390
Yeah.

387
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,270
Do you like Tang San?

388
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,150
Yes, I like him.

389
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,270
Did you hear that? I knew it.

390
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,510
He is my brother.
Of course I like him.

391
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,790
Not the kind of feeling
between siblings.

392
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,590
Don't act like you don't know.

393
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,510
Which kind of feeling do you mean?

394
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,030
Wu, listen carefully.

395
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:11,990
Do you have any other feelings
on Tang San?

396
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:12,790
Other feelings?

397
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,750
What do you mean?

398
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,430
I mean, other than treating
him as your brother,

399
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,870
do you think both of you might

400
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:18,950
go any further?

401
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,830
Any further?

402
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,510
What is that?

403
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,430
Okay. I understand now.

404
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,710
She is not pretending.
She is dumb.

405
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,750
I'm not dumb. I'm smart.

406
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:30,630
Tang San.

407
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,270
Brother Dai.

408
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,390
Where are you going?

409
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,550
I'm going to the smithy.

410
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,190
Headmaster wants to meet us.

411
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,230
Let me inform Ou Si Ke and the rest.

412
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,510
He only called both of us.

413
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,110
How come?

414
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,870
He said someone wants to meet us.

415
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,390
Master. Headmaster.

416
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,390
I was there too during the
battle last night.

417
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,350
You guys fought very well.

418
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,590
I'm Yu Tian Heng.

419
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:58,750
Tang San.

420
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,270
I'm from Tian Dou Imperial School.

421
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,270
As the name suggests, Tian Dou
Imperial School

422
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,070
was founded by the royal family of
Tian Dou Empire.

423
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,550
All the previous headmasters of the
school were the kings of the empire.

424
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,030
It is the top school in the empire.

425
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,030
Amazing.

426
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,310
Soul Master School Contest is
about to start.

427
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,550
Are you interested in the contest?

428
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,670
What kind of contest is that?

429
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:24,750
It is held by Martial Soul Hall.

430
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,470
All Soul Master Schools in the
Douluo Continent

431
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,470
will form teams to join the contest.

432
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,910
There are two major battle zones,

433
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:32,510
the Tian Dou Empire and the Xing Luo Empire.

434
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,350
The grand final

435
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,270
will be held at the
Martial Soul Main Hall

436
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,190
in Martial Soul City.

437
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,590
How does that have anything
to do with us?

438
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:39,750
I hope

439
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,790
both of you can join the team formed by

440
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,670
Tian Dou Imperial School.

441
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,270
If you reach the grand final,

442
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,990
I'm sure you will meet
your brother.

443
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,750
He is the leader of the
Xing Luo Empire's

444
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,910
Seeds battle team.

445
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,030
Don't you want to battle with him

446
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,270
again in the arena?

447
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,630
But why us?

448
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:58,150
Someone suggested both of you.
I came all the way here to confirm.

449
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,710
And I had witnessed the
battle last night.

450
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:03,670
I had to admit that both of you are
eligible to join the team.

451
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,030
Who suggests us?

452
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,070
Du Gu Yan.

453
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,230
You guys...

454
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,750
I'm from Tian Dou Imperial School
as well.

455
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,390
Yu Tian Heng is our leader.

456
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,030
I have confidence in both of you.

457
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,790
It turns out that both of
you are good

458
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,190
and able to defeat Dai Mu Bai's brother.

459
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,150
I didn't know your brother is
so powerful.

460
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,630
He had been injured during the battle.

461
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,750
And there are also seven of us against him.

462
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,230
That's good enough.

463
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,990
He is not anyone but Dai Wei Shi.

464
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,310
In this contest,

465
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:38,670
he is recognized as the contestant
who is qualified to compete

466
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,070
for the highest ranking
in Douluo Continent.

467
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,470
Impressive.

468
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,230
But I'm more curious about

469
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,350
the person who hurts him.

470
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,350
What do you mean?

471
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,430
Are you suspecting I hired someone
beforehand to hurt him?

472
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,550
Stabbing someone in the back
is not my style.

473
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,910
I prefer to fight face to face.

474
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,590
That's all about the contest.

475
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,870
If both of you are willing to join our team

476
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,590
you can quit Shi Lan Ke at any time

477
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:03,950
and go back to Tian Dou City with us

478
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,110
and join the Imperial School.

479
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,030
I won't quit Shi Lan Ke.

480
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:07,870
And also,

481
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,110
rather than joining your team,

482
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,910
I prefer to participate in the
contest on behalf of Shi Lan Ke.

483
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,550
Only recognized schools can participate
in the contest.

484
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,670
He is right.

485
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,390
Without support from the royal family,

486
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,150
Shi Lan Ke is not eligible to
join the contest.

487
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,790
This contest is a great opportunity.

488
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,670
If both of you want to join,

489
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,910
Shi Lan Ke school won't stop you.

490
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,390
I'm not going.

491
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,030
If it's about the death of Xiao Chen Yu,

492
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,470
don't worry.

493
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,310
The school will help you settle it.

494
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,350
How did you know about this matter?

495
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,230
The school will investigate
your records

496
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,590
and help you resolve all the problems.

497
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,790
I'm still not going.

498
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,830
Why?

499
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,310
Because my Master

500
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,310
and my buddies are here.

501
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,950
This is my school.

502
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,110
How about you?

503
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,470
Let me remind you.

504
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,310
You and your brother will battle anyway.

505
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,870
If you choose to join us,

506
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,790
Tian Dou Imperial School will
stand by your side.

507
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,350
We still stay here for one night.

508
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,990
Please reply to me within one day.

509
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,470
But when we walked into the room,

510
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,670
Tang San looked gentle

511
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,150
when he braided her hair.

512
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,950
My impression of Tang San
was that he always

513
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,510
treats everyone gently and politely.

514
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,390
He is always cool and calm.

515
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,030
Does he ever get angry?

516
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,230
Of course, he did.

517
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,350
He was so mad once before.

518
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,470
How did you know about that?

519
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,510
You start to gossip again.

520
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,550
Regarding this...

521
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,310
You never know that

522
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,150
in my family,

523
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,350
everything must be done
according to rules.

524
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,710
Everyone in my family is
as dull as dust.

525
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,110
They are restricted by rules.

526
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,910
Nothing is interesting about them.

527
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,390
The rules in my family,

528
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,830
I bet all of you won't believe it,

529
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,950
are as high as a wall.
Even higher than me.

530
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:09,350
So you joined Shi Lan Ke

531
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,590
to release your instincts?

532
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,590
Haven't you smelled that?

533
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:21,390
The sense of excitement and freedom
in Shi Lan Ke.

534
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:22,990
If I go back,

535
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,790
that means I will be restricted again.

536
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:25,990
Am I right?

537
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:28,550
This is not the point.

538
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,710
Aren't we talking about
Tang San just now?

539
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:31,950
Does he ever get angry before?

540
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,110
Of course.

541
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,070
When we sat for the school
admission test,

542
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,710
Wu was injured after being
attacked by Mr. Zhao.

543
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,670
Tang San only had
double Soul Rings at that time.

544
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,190
But he had defeated a Soul Saint
with Seven Soul Rings.

545
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,670
Two Soul Rings defeated
Seven Soul Rings.

546
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:43,790
How is that even possible?

547
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,190
Tang San must be a monster.

548
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,350
Why is he a monster?

549
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,230
He is my brother. He is my brother.

550
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,750
But this matter had taught us a lesson.

551
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,190
It's not a big deal if Tang San gets angry.

552
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,350
But if you irritate Wu

553
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,630
and make Tang San angry,

554
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,190
something horrible may happen.

555
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,390
That's why I said

556
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,190
the most dangerous person among
the Seven Devils

557
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:07,750
is you.

558
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,790
What are you talking about? I'm so cute.

559
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,910
You fool. You are the most important
person for Tang San.

560
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,470
A normal person

561
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:18,030
will surely avoid from
Tang San who is in a towering rage.

562
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,670
But...

563
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,470
It seems pretty good to have a guy
like Tang San.

564
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,510
Of course.

565
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,270
He is the best guy in the world.

566
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,910
Have you met every guy in the world?

567
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,070
I don't have to do that.

568
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,150
I know he is the best one.

569
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,310
She had completely fallen for him.

570
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,110
Sister. Let me braid your hair.

571
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,550
All right. Brother.

572
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,990
You are imitating me and Tang San.

573
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,510
I'm going to tell him now.

574
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:49,430
No, please.

575
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,510
We won't do it anymore.

576
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,270
I know there is a shop in Suo Tuo City

577
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,750
that sells very delicious carrot soup.

578
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,870
But the portion is too big.

579
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,670
I'm still on my diet.

580
00:30:58,670 --> 00:30:59,910
I can't finish such a large portion.

581
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,150
What if the soup is wasted?

582
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,830
I will help you finish it. I will
help you finish it.

583
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:03,710
You help me finish it.

584
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,470
I feel the same as you do.

585
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,630
Treating this place like my school.

586
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,350
I don't want to leave, either.

587
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,270
You can just reject them.

588
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,030
I remember I told you that

589
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,110
after the battle with my brother,

590
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,070
I would reveal my true identity to you.

591
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,390
My brother is Dai Wei Shi.

592
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,230
He is the heir of the first
succession line

593
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,270
of Xing Luo Empire.

594
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:42,030
Then... Then you are the...

595
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,630
I'm the prince of Xing Luo Empire.

596
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,310
Since I was a kid,

597
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,950
I lived under my brother's influences.

598
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,230
Everyone said that he is far
better than me.

599
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,310
But in Xing Luo,

600
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:57,510
the strongest becomes the king.

601
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,110
Everyone wants him to be the king.

602
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,910
While I'm the one who was forgotten by people.

603
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,230
So I came here,

604
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:07,790
Shi Lan Ke,

605
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,750
to make myself stronger

606
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,310
so as to surpass him.

607
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,870
I never wanted to fight for the throne.

608
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,670
I just want to be recognized.

609
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,630
I want to let them know that

610
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,630
I'm not a loser.

611
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:25,350
Brother Dai. You are strong enough for me.

612
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,070
If what they said is right,

613
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,150
defeating my brother in the arena

614
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,190
will be the best choice to prove myself.

615
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,830
But I don't want to quit Shi Lan Ke.

616
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,830
And I don't want to leave
everyone as well.

617
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:44,870
Do you mean

618
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:47,390
that everyone in the Xing Luo Empire
looks down on you?

619
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,070
Because my brother is stronger
since he was a kid.

620
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:54,230
Zhu Zhu Qing also feels that way?

621
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,110
I have an engagement with her.

622
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,950
She came here to call off
the engagement.

623
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:01,750
Let me ask you.

624
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,910
Now the engagement has been called off.

625
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,590
Why is she still here?

626
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:09,670
I...

627
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,550
If she looked down on you,

628
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,990
why did she choose to fight together with you

629
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,430
during the battle with your brother?

630
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,150
In the arena,

631
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,950
why did she risk herself to protect you?

632
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,030
So deep inside her heart,

633
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,390
you've already surpassed your brother.

634
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:28,870
Sometimes being strong

635
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:29,990
doesn't mean everything.

636
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,430
No matter how strong he is,

637
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,390
he won't become our leader,

638
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,550
and he couldn't be Brother Dai
who practices

639
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,270
and battles together with us.

640
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:40,550
Don't worry.

641
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,550
No matter what is your decision,

642
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,790
we will support you till the end.

643
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:56,710
I found it.

644
00:33:59,310 --> 00:33:59,990
What is that?

645
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,510
Memory book.

646
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,630
The signature of the students
when they graduated.

647
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:04,630
Which year?

648
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,470
I don't remember.

649
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,870
Because the school refused to join
the royal family and Martial Soul Hall,

650
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:11,630
capital is still the main problem.

651
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,070
That's why we don't have many students every year.

652
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,830
All of them are the students
of Shi Lan Ke?

653
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:19,350
Almost everyone here

654
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,470
is a famous Soul Master.

655
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:21,550
Yeah.

656
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,590
I remember the founder of this school

657
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,990
once said

658
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,910
that Shi Lan Ke didn't have capital,

659
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,590
power,

660
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,550
and prestige.

661
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,310
The only thing we can do is

662
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,310
to give the best to the students,

663
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,990
providing them with a bright future.

664
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,390
This is the responsibility

665
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,470
of every Master in Shi Lan Ke.

666
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,750
Seems like you already made
your decision.

667
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,230
Yes.

668
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,030
It is hard to decide.

669
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:57,750
Only by looking at this

670
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,190
can I be more courageous.

671
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,150
Look.

672
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,590
Is Zhao Wu Ji also a student from
Shi Lan Ke?

673
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,150
Yes.

674
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,270
Are we at the right place?

675
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,350
It doesn't look like a school at all.

676
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,350
They don't even have a dormitory.

677
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,150
The qualifications are bad.

678
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,670
I don't know why Tang San rejected us.

679
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:33,670
Never mind.

680
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,910
The most important person is
Dai Mu Bai.

681
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,630
He should be okay.

682
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,470
I think he was tempted just now.

683
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:45,470
What did Tang San say to you just now?

00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:18,910
