=Episode 21=

14
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:43,440
Never mind.

15
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,639
Our priority on this trip is still Dai Mu Bai.

16
00:01:47,279 --> 00:01:48,400
He shouldn't be a problem.

17
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,080
I think he was tempted just now.

18
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,120
What did Tang San tell you?

19
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:00,959
Do you know Ye Zhi Qiu
from Cang Hui School?

20
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,919
Never heard of it.

21
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,400
Cang Hui?

22
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,680
It's a little unknown school.

23
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,000
What's wrong?

24
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,239
Nothing.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,800
Did Cang Hui School get ahead of us?

26
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,240
They came to Shi Lan Ke to recruit talents?

27
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,000
A petty school like that

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,440
is no match for us.

29
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:25,080
Yu Tian Heng.

30
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:28,759
Have you made up your mind?

31
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,039
You mentioned

32
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,800
that as long as I joined
Tian Dou Imperial School,

33
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,360
your people would side with me

34
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:34,720
in the conflict against my elder brother.

35
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,399
Yes, Tian Dou Imperial School promises you.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,759
What's so funny?

37
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,080
If I fight my brother,

38
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
it means the power struggle
between the heirs of Xin Luo Empire.

39
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,960
How can a school have the authority
to support me?

40
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,639
So this promise

41
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,080
didn't come from the school.

42
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:53,000
Am I right?

43
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,399
You didn't dare to even tell the truth.

44
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,800
Tang San's decision will be mine as well.

45
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:00,800
Hold on.

46
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,160
Fine, you're right.

47
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,919
Captain.

48
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,559
Never mind, we can tell him.

49
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,279
Dai Mu Bai, someone wants to see you.

50
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,320
If you agree to join
Tian Dou Imperial School,

51
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,559
in the future, in the power struggle
of Xing Luo Empire,

52
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:18,199
you will have full support
from Tian Dou Empire.

53
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,600
Even if you need military support,

54
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:21,440
we can provide it.

55
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,759
So the tournament and the school

56
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,320
are only the pretext to use me

57
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:26,600
to interfere with the power struggle
of Xing Luo Empire.

58
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,720
No, don't think that way. It's too extreme.

59
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,440
We truly want to help you.

60
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,360
"We"?

61
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,279
Who actually wants to help me?

62
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,759
It's Xue Qing He.

63
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:38,839
Who is that?

64
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:41,639
The only heir to the throne
of Tian Dou Empire.

65
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,440
Xue Qing He, the Crown Prince.

66
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,160
The sudden announcement of the contest

67
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,080
shocked the entire Douluo Continent.

68
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,520
Every Soul Master School is preparing for it.

69
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,520
But Xue Qing He thinks

70
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:53,520
there is a conspiracy behind the contest.

71
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,800
What conspiracy?

72
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,199
I have no idea either.

73
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:57,839
You may ask him yourself.

74
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,279
Why didn't he come to see me?

75
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,600
His Highness thinks

76
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,240
too many parties are involved in this case.

77
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:03,919
Besides, the inside of Tian Dou City

78
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,440
isn't as peaceful as it seems.

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,240
He can only meet you in private.

80
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,559
So the proposal to recruit us

81
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:10,440
was false?

82
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,960
No. We are indeed
recruiting new members.

83
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:14,720
That's all I know.

84
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,919
For more details,

85
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,880
you may ask the Crown Prince.

86
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,079
Yan Zi, what's wrong?

87
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,839
I think she's been poisoned.

88
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,720
Poisoned? How is that possible?

89
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,000
We've been travelling together.

90
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,000
Why wasn't I poisoned?

91
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,359
She needs to eat this now.

92
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:42,320
It'll cure her.

93
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:46,559
Weeping Forsythia.
I've never seen this before.

94
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,200
This is my Second Soul Skill.

95
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,640
Vitalizing Weeping Forsythia.

96
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:51,239
Try it out, it's delicious.

97
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,040
No. I'm afraid it's bitter.

98
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,480
It's not bitter at all.

99
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,799
It can even cure poison.

100
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,040
She is awake!

101
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,880
See? She's awake!

102
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,920
What happened to me just now?

103
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,200
Where are we?

104
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,519
He said you had been poisoned.

105
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,279
Poisoned?

106
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:14,600
Why don't I remember that?

107
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:16,000
It's all right. You are cured.

108
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:22,160
This can't be right!

109
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,480
My Weeping Forsythia

110
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,440
cures everything!

111
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:26,359
Maybe you should have another one.

112
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:29,079
I doubt the capability of your Martial Soul.

113
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,239
Maybe she fainted because of hunger.

114
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,959
I have some sausages.

115
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:33,480
Do you want some?

116
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,640
Maybe we should get a doctor.

117
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:39,760
Never mind.

118
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:41,279
Du Gu Yan's identity is special.

119
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,839
I'm taking her back to Tian Dou City.

120
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,040
If she has been poisoned,

121
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:45,559
her elder will definitely handle it.

122
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,760
I was supposed to go with you,

123
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,880
but under the circumstances, I must go now.

124
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,480
You two depart later.

125
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,880
Make it to Xi Si City in ten days
to meet His Highness.

126
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,320
His Highness?

127
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,279
Xi Si City?

128
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:57,239
What is it?

129
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,959
Xi Si City Soul Arena.

130
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,040
Accept the Fiend Battle Team's challenge.

131
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,079
Once you overcome the challenge,

132
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,880
you're qualified to go to Cang Hui School

133
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,200
in Tian Dou City and see me.

134
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:09,959
Why are we meeting in Xi Si City?

135
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,959
The meeting between His Highness
and Dai Mu Bai is a top secret.

136
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,760
First of all,

137
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,799
Xi Si City is on the way to the Capital.

138
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:15,839
Secondly,

139
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,079
there is no Governor in that city.

140
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,359
The city is not owned by anyone.

141
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:21,079
The place will provide more cover.

142
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:22,519
Remember

143
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,799
to reach Xi Si City in ten days
to meet His Highness.

144
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,519
Rong Rong, where is Wu?

145
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,839
Her legs haven't fully recovered.

146
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,839
Sister Qing is looking after her.

147
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:41,640
Do you know

148
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,600
why Headmaster wants us to come here?

149
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,640
I have no idea.

150
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:45,600
I don't know.

151
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,239
What are we going to do here?

152
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,359
Why is she still here?

153
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,679
She was hurt in the fight
against Dai Wei Shi.

154
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,119
I couldn't just kick her out.

155
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:57,640
Should we avoid her?

156
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:00,359
She will find it out sooner or later.

157
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:03,279
Where is Yu Tian Heng?

158
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:04,760
He left.

159
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,440
I'll get to the point.

160
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:08,880
Do not mention Xue Qing He.

161
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,760
Martial Soul Hall is organizing

162
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,720
the Soul Master School Contest.

163
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,279
Tian Dou Imperial School

164
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,959
formally invited Tang San and Dai Mu Bai

165
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,160
to join their team

166
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,079
in the contest.

167
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:20,000
Not bad!

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,799
Impressive, Brother San.

169
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:22,279
Even Tian Dou Imperial School knows him.

170
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:25,440
After much consideration,

171
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,399
we've decided to let you

172
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,519
go to Tian Dou City

173
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:32,279
and participate in this event.

174
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:33,760
But Headmaster,

175
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,279
joining Tian Dou Imperial School

176
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,760
means quitting Shi Lan Ke School.

177
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,320
The goal of Shi Lan Ke School

178
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,920
is to train up the best Soul Masters.

179
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,359
The best Soul Master

180
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:44,359
needs to hone his skills and face challenges

181
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,480
to make progress.

182
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,480
Martial Soul Hall

183
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,000
is providing the greatest platform,

184
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,480
and as your headmaster,

185
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,640
I must show you the world.

186
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:55,000
But Headmaster...

187
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,679
I know.

188
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,000
I also hope

189
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,480
you guys will always be the students
of Shi Lan Ke.

190
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,200
But I can't force you to give up

191
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,519
this great chance

192
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,239
just to keep you in Shi Lan Ke.

193
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:04,959
Wouldn't that be too selfish of me

194
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,239
to do such a thing?

195
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,160
So,

196
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,440
not only Tang San and Dai Mu Bai are going there,

197
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,799
all members of our school

198
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,359
will go to the Capital together!

199
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,399
-Really?
-It's real?

200
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,640
You should see for yourselves

201
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,880
how many geniuses there are

202
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,000
in Douluo Continent.

203
00:08:21,799 --> 00:08:23,559
Get ready, everyone.

204
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,760
We'll set out tomorrow morning.

205
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:25,519
Yes!

206
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,239
This is great!

207
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,279
If we go to the Capital,

208
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:28,679
I might get to meet my father.

209
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,799
I must tell

210
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:30,920
Wu and Sister Qing now.

211
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:32,679
Master.

212
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,720
He said

213
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:38,000
that the school

214
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,320
shouldn't become the shackles
that bind you.

215
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,359
If it can give you a brighter future,

216
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,320
even with the school as your stepping stone,

217
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,239
he must let you fly high.

218
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,559
Even if he loses all the students,

219
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,159
it is worth it.

220
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:51,559
I'm not leaving Shi Lan Ke.

221
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,280
I won't either.

222
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,000
Set out with that belief.

223
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,400
This is an eye-opener

224
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:59,200
that will let you grow.

225
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,760
I wish we could participate

226
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,320
as the students of Shi Lan Ke School.

227
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:06,679
There might be other opportunities
in Tian Dou City.

228
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,200
I'll go to pack things up.

229
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:17,119
Headmaster.

230
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,679
Are you really taking them
to Tian Dou City?

231
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:28,200
Do you want to get in my way?

232
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,280
No.

233
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,520
I'm going back to the Capital.

234
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,520
We are going in the same direction.

235
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,679
You will travel faster without us.

236
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,239
I'm not in a hurry.

237
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,520
You haven't given up on Dai Mu Bai?

238
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,400
I won't quit so easily.

239
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:45,880
I know what you did to Dai Mu Bai.

240
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:49,799
If you try to harm my students again,

241
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:52,080
I will stop you.

242
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:09,760
Master.

243
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,320
We'll pass by Xi Si City

244
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,000
on our journey.

245
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,880
Are you still thinking
about challenging the Fiend Battle Team?

246
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,039
Master, I want to find my father.

247
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:23,760
I want to know what he's doing.

248
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,239
I want to know what happened to him.

249
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:30,039
This is probably my only chance.

250
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,039
Very well.

251
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,919
I'll inform Lander,

252
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,039
so he won't stop you then.

253
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,559
Thank you, Master.

254
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,200
By the way,

255
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,000
don't tell the others about my plan.

256
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:50,520
What about Wu? Won't you tell her?

257
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,000
I don't want her to be worried.

258
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,320
I wish I could

259
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,239
take everything about the school with me.

260
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:53,919

We'll reach Xi Si City soon.

300
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,039
What's that ahead?

301
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:12,159
Let's have a look.

302
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:28,880
What happened?

303
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,200
We should bury them.

304
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,200
We can't leave them here in the sun.

305
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,320
Here, Brother Dai.

306
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,119
Come.

307
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:03,280
Soul Arena Badge?

308
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,679
Soul Arena Badge?

309
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,599
It's copper.

310
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,640
This man was an experienced Soul Master.

311
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,640
But why was he tied here?

312
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,319
Maybe he ran into bandits?

313
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,280
We must hurry to Xi Si City.

314
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,680
Everyone, stay alert.

315
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,239
-Yes.
-Yes.

316
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:42,199
Brother Dai.

317
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:42,880
He...

318
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:47,400
Give me some water.

319
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,040
Here.

320
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,160
This...

321
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,760
He is alive!

322
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,959
It's the same as that guy.

323
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,640
Which means

324
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,359
the other man died from dehydration.

325
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,680
Isn't this too cruel? What hatred can it be?

326
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:10,640
Master.

327
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:12,319
Ou Si Ke, come.

328
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,680
Full Recovery Big Sausage!

329
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:19,760
Tang San, this helps him recover his strength.

330
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:20,560
Yes.

331
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:30,959
He is dead.

332
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,920
Triple Soul Rings.

333
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:39,800
He was a Soul Master too.

334
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,560
I like this place.

335
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:03,280
This looks funny.

336
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:05,479
It's adorable.

337
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,199
Gang, I'll look for a cheap inn first.

338
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:30,520
Show the others around the city.

339
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:31,599
Don't take too long.

340
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:32,160
Master.

341
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,199
Master.

342
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,119
This looks pretty.

343
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:35,839
Take me with you. I know how to bargain.

344
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,079
You're the best.

345
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:38,040
Go with me.

346
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,280
That way.

347
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,920
Stay close to each other.
Don't get separated.

348
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,880
Xi Si City Soul Arena.

349
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:57,040
Accept the Fiend Battle Team's challenge.

350
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:58,920
Once you overcome the challenge,

351
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,400
you're qualified to go to Cang Hui School

352
00:20:00,439 --> 00:20:01,719
in Tian Dou City and see me.

353
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,680
Brother, you look upset.

354
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:08,959
I'm all right.

355
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:12,239
Did someone upset you? I can teach him a lesson.

356
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,160
Why do you want to fight so much?

357
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:18,359
What's the matter? She is my sister. I spoiled her.

358
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:21,599
You're overindulging her.

359
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:26,839
Have a look!

360
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,199
The wonder of Xi Si City!

361
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:31,680
Interact closely with fluffy Soul Beasts!

362
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:33,280
Have a look!

363
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,599
Look!

364
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:36,640
You can pet them.

365
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:38,680
They are so cute.

366
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,199
Have a look!

367
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:42,920
They are so adorable
that they can heal your heart!

368
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,560
The wonder of Xi Si City!

369
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,760
Aren't these Sand Beasts?

370
00:20:46,199 --> 00:20:48,040
Wu, you also know about Sand Beasts?

371
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:50,199
I saw them once when I was little.

372
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:53,119
They mostly live in the desert.

373
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:55,079
These Soul Beasts are tame.

374
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:57,640
It sounds that they are rare.

375
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,359
All right, stop playing around.

376
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,199
Let's go there.

377
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:01,479
We'll wait for Headmaster.

378
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:02,040
It's less crowded there.

379
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,560
Sure.

380
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,319
Come.

381
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,839
Let's go.

382
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,520
The wonder of Xi Si City!

383
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:07,520
Let's go.

384
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,359
Adorable!

385
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,560
Take a seat and have some rest.

386
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:13,959
Stop looking, keep moving.

387
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:19,839
Sit.

388
00:21:20,199 --> 00:21:20,880
You sit.

389
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:25,199
Master, how about

390
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,800
we gather some money and buy one?

391
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:28,959
The girls seem to like it a lot.

392
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,160
Each girl can pet it for one day.

393
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:32,079
We can sell it in Tian Dou City

394
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:32,760
and make a profit.

395
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,719
It can cover some expenses for our school.

396
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:35,959
Can we get one?

397
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,000
The Sand Beast is not a pet.

398
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,839
You can't buy or sell it.

399
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:41,880
Why?

400
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:44,040
The merchant is their owner.

401
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,560
That's right.

402
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,640
Their relationship is equal and cooperative.

403
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,040
The merchant will attract the customers,

404
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,560
and the Sand Beasts contribute their talent.

405
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:54,000
Talent? What talent?

406
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:54,760
Silly.

407
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,160
Their talent is being cute, of course.

408
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:00,880
How is being cute a talent?

409
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,199
In that case,

410
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,280
I'm also cute.

411
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,199
I am talented.

412
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:04,880
I am interesting.

413
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:05,599
Isn't that right?

414
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,119
So how do they split the profit?

415
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:10,920
All the money goes to the Sand Beasts.

416
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,359
All the money?

417
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,560
The Sand Beasts use money?

418
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,839
Do not underestimate
the intelligence of Soul Beasts.

419
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:18,359
A full-grown Sand Beast

420
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:19,959
has the intelligence of a child.

421
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,719
The merchant will send the food
out of the city for them

422
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:25,000
to the Sand Beast herd.

423
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:28,839
That means

424
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:30,680
the Sand Beasts are social animals.

425
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,839
The merchant delivers food for them

426
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:34,839
without charging anything.

427
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,079
What benefit does he get?

428
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,959
The benefit for the merchant

429
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,520
is the protection by Sand Beasts

430
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,880
when he crosses the desert.

431
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,359
Protection?

432
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,520
But they look so adorable.

433
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,520
They seem harmless.

434
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,680
What if

435
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:53,000
the merchant bullies them?

436
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,040
Not just the merchants, even Soul Masters

437
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,199
wouldn't dare to hurt them.

438
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,560
Why?

439
00:22:59,400 --> 00:22:59,959
Actually,

440
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:02,479
Sand Beasts have the ability
to control sandstorm.

441
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,199
When they feel threatened,

442
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,119
the Sand Beasts are capable of destroying a city.

443
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,680
They are invincible in the desert.

444
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:13,680
But the Sand Beasts are friendly and tame.

445
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,839
So attacking them is unprofitable
for the humans.

446
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:17,040
Then a mutual relationship

447
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,400
started to form between humans and Sand Beasts.

448
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:19,400
I see.

449
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,640
Humans and Soul Beasts
can live in harmony.

450
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,119
Of course.

451
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,000
In that case,

452
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,040
if all the Soul Beasts could
form a mutual relationship with us,

453
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,880
there would be no more hunting!

454
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:33,199
Am I right?

455
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,160
This is only an exception.

456
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:37,000
As long as Soul Masters still need
to hunt down Soul Beasts

457
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,839
to advance their Soul Rings,

458
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:39,040
humans and Soul Beasts

459
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,000
will always be at war.

460
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:43,040
We just have to restrict

461
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,839
the hunting and killing
to those fierce, awful Soul Beasts.

462
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,719
Wouldn't that solve it?

463
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,119
Do you think fierce Soul Beasts should die?

464
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,119
We are Soul Masters.

465
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,760
Soul Masters and Soul Beasts

466
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:57,319
are destined to be enemies.

467
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,119
It cannot be changed.

468
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:03,079
Yes, they are enemies.

469
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,959
Brother Dai, have some milk tea.

470
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:13,880
Thanks.

471
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,400
We lived in the wild for a few days.

472
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:18,839
We finally get to take a break.

473
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:21,280
When you went out,

474
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,000
Headmaster informed us

475
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,040
that we'll be going

476
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,239
to Tian Dou City tomorrow morning.

477
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,880
Yu Tian Heng said

478
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:28,599
that Xue Qing He wanted to see you.

479
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,800
Won't you stay for another day?

480
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:31,680
Forget it. We're leaving.

481
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,520
You don't want to meet him?

482
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:34,040
The Crown Prince of Tian Dou Empire

483
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,760
meeting the Prince of
Xing Luo Empire in secrecy,

484
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,560
what good can it do?

485
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,640
I never wanted the throne anyway.

486
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:40,959
Even if I want to compete for the throne,

487
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:42,640
it's none of his business.

488
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:45,000
You're right.

489
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,359
Come in.

490
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:54,439
It's been a long journey for Mr. Tang.

491
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,079
I'm glad that Mr. Dai is here as well.

492
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,560
Who are you?

493
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,079
I am Ma Xiu Nuo. I'm nobody.

494
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,560
I've been here waiting for you for a few days.

495
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:05,680
To be honest,

496
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,359
there are some issues in Tian Dou City.

497
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:09,040
His Highness couldn't make it here in time.

498
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:10,920
He sent me to express his apology.

499
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,040
His Highness?

500
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,920
You work for Xue Qing He?

501
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:15,760
Yes.

502
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,160
You're one of the royals too?

503
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,119
My father is a low-ranking officer.

504
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:21,719
I don't have any positions at all.

505
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:23,280
I'm far from being a royal.

506
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,560
An officer? It is quite important.

507
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,439
What does Xue Qing He have to say?

508
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:30,359
His Highness promises

509
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,560
to meet both of you in Tian Dou City.

510
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:34,439
I'm not interested.

511
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:36,640
You don't have to reject me now.

512
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,239
Your brother is very powerful.

513
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,959
With the help of His Highness,

514
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:42,479
you'll stand a chance to fight for the throne.

515
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:46,479
He should stay out of Xing Luo Empire's problem.

516
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,400
I'm merely a messenger,
please calm down.

517
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,079
What are you doing here?

518
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,880
Wu, were you talking to someone?

519
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,959
I wanted to ask you to check out the market,

520
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,800
and I saw Hu Lie Na at your door.

521
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:07,520
I've passed on the message. I'm leaving.

522
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,400
Was he your new friend?

523
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,040
He seemed to be rich.

524
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:15,040
Don't trust everything you heard.

525
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,000
Ignore him.

526
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,239
You have something to do?

527
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:19,920
It's nothing.

528
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,959
Go with me to the market.

529
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:31,479
So the man came to deliver a message

530
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:33,119
from the Crown Prince of Tian Dou Empire?

531
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:35,959
The Crown Prince wanted to see Brother Dai.

532
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:37,439
It had nothing to do with me.

533
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,959
Two princes,

534
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,920
is it a political marriage?

535
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:42,959
A political marriage

536
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,040
is between a prince and a princess.

537
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,319
It's not meant for commoners.

538
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:46,760
Understood?

539
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,719
They look delicious.

540
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:57,880
Do you want some?

541
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,079
What's wrong? You don't want to try it?

542
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:06,800
I'm just checking them out.

543
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,439
Let's go back.

544
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,079
It's all right. If you want...

545
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:16,000
Can you hear it?

546
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,199
Someone is sobbing.

547
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,239
Let's have a look.

548
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:29,160
We're getting closer. Stay cautious.

549
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,800
Did something happen?

550
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:48,239
Did someone bully you?

551
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,079
She can't hear you.

552
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,079
Is she deaf?

553
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,880
No. She is insane.

554
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,280
How did it happen?

555
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:00,199
Her husband died in the Soul Arena.

556
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,439
Then she lost her mind!

557
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,000
You aren't locals?

558
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:06,000
Haven't you heard about the Fiend Battle Team?

559
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:08,199
No.

560
00:28:08,199 --> 00:28:09,560
What's wrong with the Fiend Battle Team?

561
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,599
In the Soul Arena,

562
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:13,040
those who fought the Fiend Battle Team

563
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,280
have mostly died.

564
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,959
Those who survived were tied up

565
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,160
and left in the sun outside the city.

566
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:24,680
What happened?

567
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:28,719
The Fiend Battle Team did that?

568
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,319
If they are so brutal,

569
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:33,520
why would the Soul Masters want to fight them?

570
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:35,040
Their families were captured.

571
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,880
If they don't fight,
they will lose their entire families.

572
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:38,719
Where is the authority?

573
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:41,920
Xi Si City has no Governor.

574
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,040
The city is in anarchy.

575
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,439
In this city,

576
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:48,079
it's the survival of the fittest.

577
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:51,599
Is the Fiend Battle Team very strong?

578
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:55,319
They are almost all
Quadruple Soul Rings Soul Sects.

579
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,560
What do you think?

580
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,079
Quadruple Soul Rings? And more than one?

581
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,800
Tang San? Wu?

582
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:32,520
Wang Sheng.

583
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:45,599
Who are you?

584
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:47,839
Young Master, what's wrong?

585
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:55,280
Tell them you're all right.

586
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:57,280
I'm all right.

587
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,959
Where is Xue Qing He?

588
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:02,040
His Highness is in Tian Dou City.

589
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,280
Why doesn't he come to Xi Si City?

590
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:10,160
He planned to come here.

591
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,439
But the Prince wanted to
have a word with His Highness.

592
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,920
He couldn't make it in time.

593
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,359
In Tian Dou City,

594
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:19,680
will he look for Dai Mu Bai?

595
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:22,359
Sure, certainly.

596
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:26,280
Why does Xue Qing He want to meet Dai Mu Bai?

597
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,359
I don't know.

598
00:30:34,439 --> 00:30:35,680
Why is the robe on the floor?

599
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:42,239
Young Master, I was shocked.

600
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:43,000
What happened?

601
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
I heard you yell.

602
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:45,719
I didn't yell.

603
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,280
Let's go.

604
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,880
If I keep staying in the inn,

605
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:50,719
I won't have time to check out the city.

606
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,000
I heard there are many specialties.

607
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,839
I could buy them as souvenirs.

608
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:58,439
What is it, Young Master?

609
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,439
That girl...

610
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:01,359
She looks familiar.

611
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:05,119
Forget it, let's go.

612
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:06,000
I might be mistaken.

613
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:20,839
I feel like our days in Nuoding School

614
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,040
were merely yesterday.

615
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:25,760
Time flies.

616
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,680
Back then, the attached students
were like a family.

617
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,599
We took part in the election
of the Soul Master Association.

618
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,719
We went to class together.

619
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,680
It was a pleasant time.

620
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:36,119
Wang Sheng, what are you doing here?

621
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:37,479
I escaped here.

622
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,800
Why did you escape?

623
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,680
I've been keeping something from you.

624
00:31:43,239 --> 00:31:43,920
I feel guilty.

625
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,079
Do you remember Xiao Chen Yu?

626
00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:47,199
Sure.

627
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,000
He captured me with a cage.

628
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:51,079
Luckily, Tang San saved me.

629
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,119
Actually, I killed Xiao Chen Yu.

630
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,920
I'm going to kill you!

631
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:02,800
After I escaped,

632
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:05,560
I found that they framed you as the killer.

633
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,880
I feel sorry for letting you take the blame.

634
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,319
Why did you kill him?

635
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:12,920
He made me betray you.

636
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:14,719
He even wanted to kill me.

637
00:32:15,479 --> 00:32:16,560
Since I had the opportunity,

638
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:18,560
I wouldn't let them get away.

639
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,599
I must take revenge on them

640
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,719
for what I went through.

641
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:23,000
He deserved to die.

642
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:27,040
Actually, our fellow students

643
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,239
are true friends.

644
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:30,000
Did you just arrive today?

645
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,199
Yes.

646
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:32,680
Have you been to the market?

647
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:33,880
Yes.

648
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,040
What did you buy?

649
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:36,479
Nothing.

650
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,599
Nothing interested you?

651
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:42,560
There is.

652
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,680
I like that candy.

653
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,479
The candy?

654
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,880
Come with me.

655
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:55,800
Here you go.

656
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,119
Is this your shop?

657
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,040
I don't have the time.

658
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,640
Why didn't you pay?

659
00:33:03,479 --> 00:33:04,319
In this city,

660
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,439
if you want something,

661
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,560
just let me know.

662
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:07,520
I can get it for free.

663
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,079
Wang Sheng.

664
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,599
I think they are afraid of you.

665
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,920
The weak fears the strong.

666
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,599
Take it.

667
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,719
I can't take this.

668
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,520
Why not?

669
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:25,199
If you don't pay for it, it's robbing.

670
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,920
I don't want that candy.

671
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,760
Since you've arrived,

672
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,119
why didn't you come to us?

673
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,359
"Us"?

674
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:40,319
Didn't Master Ye

675
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,439
tell you?

676
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,800
You should come to us
when you arrived in Xi Si City.

677
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,520
You know Ye Zhi Qiu too?

678
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:48,319
Why should we go to you?

679
00:33:48,439 --> 00:33:50,439
Wu, it's getting late.

680
00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:51,599
Let me walk you back.

681
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:53,160
But...

682
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:58,760
There is nothing funny.

683
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:01,359
You can't compare this place
with Tian Dou City.

684
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,079
What is this?

685
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:06,599
It looks funny.

686
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,760
We've never been to Xi Si City before.

687
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:10,920
Maybe they are beasts that pull carriages.

688
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:12,800
They are ugly yet cute.

689
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,280
They look interesting.

690
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,479
So you are on the Fiend Battle Team.

691
00:34:19,439 --> 00:34:19,959
Yes.

692
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,919
I'm one of their members.

693
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,040
After I left Nuoding City,

694
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,120
I wanted to attend another Soul Master School.

695
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,439
But I couldn't afford the fees.

696
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,919
Then I considered going to Martial Soul Hall.

697
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:34,719
But the people there

698
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:36,639
looked down on me.

699
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,040
They said I wasn't gifted and wouldn't take me in.

700
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:42,639
Then,

701
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:44,439
I wandered from city to city.

702
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:45,959
I ran out of money soon.

703
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,120
Later, I found

704
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,399
that some cities would open up

705
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,360
some underground Soul Arenas.

706
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,760
The Soul Masters would fight there.

707
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,280
You kill or get killed.

708
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:58,120
Though it's dangerous,

709
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,439
you can make a fortune if you win.

710
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,120
So I joined.

711
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:05,879
But I completely lost at the first time.

712
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,280
I was about to be killed.

713
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,479
Do you know what happened next?

714
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,120
I can't guess.

715
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,919
My Martial Soul mutated.

716
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:31,479
My ordinary Tiger Soul

717
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:32,719
turned into a Blood Tiger Soul.

718
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:34,919
God gave me a chance!

719
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,159
After the mutation,

720
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,399
the force behind the Fiend Battle Team found me.

721
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:40,280
They told me

722
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,959
that whoever works alone will be bullied.

723
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,159
But if we stick together,

724
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:45,479
it will be different.
