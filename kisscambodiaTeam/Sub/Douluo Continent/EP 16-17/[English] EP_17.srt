00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:43,960
Snow Return.

15
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,040
True Soul Flower.

16
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,320
So you didn't die.

17
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,790
It's you?

18
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,150
I have verified it.

19
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:51,830
You did

20
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,600
smear the contents of the bottle on the target.

21
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,190
Not bad.

22
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,040
What was in the bottle?

23
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,190
Lethal poison.

24
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,110
My plan was

25
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,510
to let you die along with her.

26
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,870
Then why didn't anything happen to her?

27
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,550
You don't have to know.

28
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,680
You only need to know

29
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,510
that since Bu Le sent you here,

30
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,550
you are not expected to return alive.

31
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,680
He intended to kill you

32
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,320
with my hands.

33
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,830
But since you're still alive,

34
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,640
it proves that you still have potential.

35
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,440
Then can you cure Wu's poison now?

36
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,950
Hold on.

37
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,280
Since you have potential,

38
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm willing to give you a chance.

39
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,920
Do you want to join us?

40
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,030
Not interested.

41
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,390
We are a colossal force

42
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,590
hidden in Douluo Continent.

43
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,950
The future is limitless with us.

44
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,830
I am really not interested.

45
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,720
The one supporting us

46
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,360
is a Grand Soul Land Master with Nine Soul Rings.

47
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,030
He is even a legend

48
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,800
among the Grand Soul Land Masters.

49
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,750
Have you heard of

50
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,720
the one who fought against Martial Soul Hall,

51
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,190
Hao Tian Soul Master,

52
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,350
Tang Hao?

53
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,630
Tang Hao.

54
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,040
Seems like you've heard of him.

55
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,910
Hao Tian Soul Master.

56
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,030
What is his Martial Soul?

57
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,550
Naturally, it's the Hao Tian Hammer.

58
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,320
Remember my word.

59
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,190
Do not let anyone discover
the Martial Soul on your left hand.

60
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,160
I have many things to do.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,190
You won't be able to keep up with me.

62
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,960
You're saying

63
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,390
that all of this,

64
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,190
including the Martial Soul mutation
in the Nightfire Village,

65
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,520
was supported by Hao Tian Soul Master?

66
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,110
Not just the Nightfire Village.

67
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,160
There are many Soul Masters

68
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,720
in Douluo Continent

69
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,479
who are undergoing
Martial Soul mutation experiments.

70
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,110
Why?

71
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,880
Are you scared

72
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,030
after hearing the name
of a Grand Soul Land Master?

73
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,830
How can I meet him?

74
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,190
It's not that easy

75
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,360
to join us.

76
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,000
You have to pass a test.

77
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,640
What test?

78
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,510
Xi Si City Soul Arena.

79
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,440
Accept the Fiend Battle Team's challenge.

80
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,640
Once you overcome the challenge,

81
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,510
you're qualified to go to Cang Hui School

82
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,600
in Tian Dou City and see me.

83
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,070
Will Tang Hao be there too?

84
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,830
Don't mention his name casually.

85
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,950
Martial Soul Hall has been chasing after him.

86
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:45,880
Alright.

87
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,880
Once I've saved Wu,

88
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,720
I will go to Xi Si City.

89
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,440
Your capabilities now

90
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,720
are not enough.

91
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,760
Get stronger.

92
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,200
You can only challenge

93
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,230
the Fiend Battle Team
when you are strong enough.

94
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,880
(One day,)

95
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,160
(when your heart and Martial Soul)

96
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,760
(become powerful beyond comparison,)

97
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,760
(I will come to you.)

98
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,480
Tang San?

99
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,510
Why are you here?

100
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,110
What happened?

101
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,270
Are you alright?

102
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm fine.

103
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,790
I got the antidote.

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,040
You got the antidote?

105
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:36,670
Let's go.

106
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,000
Master, I'll try it first.

107
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,160
I'm concerned about the antidote
Ye Zhi Qiu gave me.

108
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,120
Since he wants you to join him,

109
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,030
I don't think you have to worry.

110
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,560
Wu cannot get hurt again.

111
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,240
Seems like nothing is happening.

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,520
Master,

113
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,430
we've already cured her.

114
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,750
Why isn't she waking up?

115
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,910
I guess,

116
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,310
it might have something to do with you.

117
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,400
Me?

118
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,280
Your Blue Silver Plant Martial Soul

119
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,080
can hold the power from other Martial Souls.

120
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,520
Right now, three of your Soul Rings,

121
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,910
Thorn Apple Snake, Haunted Vine,

122
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:10,720
and Human Faced Demon Spider,

123
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,729
are poisonous.

124
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,310
Especially those with unique poison,
Thorn Apple Snake

125
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,240
and Human Faced Demon Spider.

126
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,840
The poison in the bottle

127
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,910
didn't take effect on you

128
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,800
because your Thorn Apple Snake Soul Ring

129
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,560
suppressed it.

130
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,080
You also absorbed

131
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,350
the Human Faced Demon Spider's Soul Ring.

132
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,150
Both kinds of poison
were synthesized in your body.

133
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,470
So I suppose

134
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,800
you are now immune to poison.

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,560
But how does that affect Wu?

136
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,190
I didn't see what happened,

137
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,720
but the kids said

138
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,960
that when they arrived,

139
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,520
Wu was covered in blood.

140
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,310
You attacked her.

141
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:44,960
You mean

142
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,240
I am now poisonous?

143
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,560
You have already fully absorbed the Soul Bone,

144
00:07:49,896 --> 00:07:51,240
so you aren't carrying the poison anymore.

145
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,350
However, when the Soul Bone first came out,

146
00:07:54,146 --> 00:07:55,310
the poison was still there.

147
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,430
So, when you attacked Wu,

148
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,280
you poisoned her.

149
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,240
So I harmed her.

150
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,750
But,

151
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,870
only you can save her.

152
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,520
What should I do?

153
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,910
Your Blue Silver Plant

154
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,750
can absorb everything.

155
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,470
Naturally, it can also absorb toxins.

156
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,190
What you can do now

157
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,350
is to place your Blue Silver Plant
near her wounds,

158
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,190
to help her get rid of the toxins.

159
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:26,910
Alright!

160
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,400
Her clothes will get in the way.

161
00:08:42,646 --> 00:08:43,920
It must be in direct contact with the wound.

162
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,550
But Wu...

163
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,480
Isn't she your sister?

164
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,520
(Her life comes first.)

165
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,520
Master,

166
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,670
I've already done what you said.

167
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,080
I absorbed the toxin from Wu

168
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,630
using the Blue Silver Plant.

169
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,040
Let her rest.

170
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,230
When Headmaster is back,

171
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,480
we'll wake her up

172
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,870
and return to Shi Lan Ke immediately.

173
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,040
Master,

174
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,310
I want to know my dad's past.

175
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,400
I promised your dad that I would not say a word.

176
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,840
You can ask him yourself

177
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,230
when you see him.

178
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,280
Ye Zhi Qiu said

179
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,600
the Nightfire Village incident

180
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,720
and the Martial Soul mutation

181
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,520
were actually controlled by my dad.

182
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,280
I don't know why he did that.

183
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,600
I feel

184
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,840
that I don't understand him at all.

185
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,310
I only know things about him
because people tell me.

186
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,230
Tang San,

187
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:11,840
I can only tell you

188
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,310
that your dad is indeed Hao Tian Soul Master.

189
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,360
As for the one behind the Martial Soul mutation,

190
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,040
it may not be him.

191
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,400
Don't believe so easily anything others tell you.

192
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,630
When my dad left, he told me

193
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,720
that our family had many secrets.

194
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,040
He'd tell me when I become stronger.

195
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,790
But how do I know when I am strong enough?

196
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,990
I think

197
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,840
I should go to Xi Si City

198
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,190
and challenge the Fiend Battle Team.

199
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,960
I'll join Ye Zhi Qiu!

200
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,840
That's the fastest way for me to meet him.

201
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:41,720
You're wrong!

202
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,550
Maybe, in Shi Lan Ke,

203
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,360
you're considered strong.

204
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,960
But your power is nothing

205
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,104
in the entire Douluo Continent!

206
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,310
If you go to Xi Si City now,

207
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,720
you won't succeed!

208
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
But if I go back to school,

209
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,870
I will see Ma Hong Jun.

210
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,430
How can I face him?

211
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,080
The way things has progressed

212
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,160
is not your fault.

213
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,080
You have a long way ahead.

214
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,040
Thank you, Master.

215
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,160
I will definitely do my best.

216
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,310
Brother!

217
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:40,990
Watch your step.

218
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,280
You haven't fully recovered.

219
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:46,990
Brother.

220
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,400
In the Star Forest,

221
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,790
when you didn't recognize me,

222
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,670
I was terrified.

223
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,040
You are my dear sister.

224
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,840
I promise

225
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,230
I will never hurt you again.

226
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,310
Great.

227
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,430
You have my word.

228
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:02,720
Let's go.

229
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,080
Alright.

230
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,550
Everyone, let's take a rest here.

231
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,360
Gang, you seem to be out of breath.

232
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,280
Not in good shape.

233
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,430
I'm not like you.

234
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,360
You're healthy, old yet strong.

235
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,990
You're saying I'm old?

236
00:13:23,354 --> 00:13:24,230
Be careful of your words.

237
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,040
I'll get some fruit there.

238
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,600
Hong Jun!

239
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,280
Brother San?

240
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,630
Hong Jun.

241
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,360
I'm sorry.

242
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,280
What's wrong?

243
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,040
I know who the mastermind

244
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,080
behind the Martial Soul mutation is.

245
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,310
Who is it?

246
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,720
The Grand Soul Land Master, Tang Hao.

247
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,230
The Grand Soul Land Master?

248
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,840
He is also my father.

249
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,110
Your father?

250
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,280
Why would your father

251
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,080
be involved in the mutation incident?

252
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,310
Ye Zhi Qiu told me about it.

253
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,110
Who is he?

254
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,520
He is Bu Le's boss.

255
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,400
Regardless of whether it's true or not,

256
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,080
I need to tell you about it.

257
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,310
You are one of the victims, after all.

258
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,230
If I hide this from you,

259
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,550
I really don't know how to face you.

260
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,280
Hong Jun,

261
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,520
if you want to take revenge, do it.

262
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,960
I won't fight back.

263
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,630
Did Ye Zhi Qiu tell you this

264
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,040
before the Nightfire Village incident?

265
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:57,840
No.

266
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,110
I only knew it

267
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,960
after we got out of the Star Forest.

268
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,920
There's no evidence

269
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,110
that Ye Zhi Qiu was telling the truth.

270
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,400
Brother San,

271
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:15,960
I trust you.

272
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,600
Even if the truth

273
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,310
may not be what we want to face,

274
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,110
I won't blame you.

275
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,480
After all,

276
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,080
you're you.

277
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,360
He's he.

278
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,790
Thank you, Hong Jun.

279
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,630
I will definitely find out

280
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,790
who the real culprit is.

281
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,080
Even if it is truly my father,

282
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,750
I will definitely stop him.

283
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,960
I'm with you.

284
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,790
We're finally back!

285
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:05,960
I'm so tired.

286
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,400
You must be exhausted.

287
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:14,670
So tired.

288
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,190
Everyone.

289
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:15,720
Take a seat.

290
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,110
Go back to your room and take a rest.

291
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:17,920
Tomorrow morning,

292
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,990
assemble here.

293
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,600
Assemble in the morning?

294
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,840
We just came back!

295
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,790
All of you need to start
your training course tomorrow.

296
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,960
Isn't it too hasty?

297
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,720
You have no right to bargain.

298
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,400
All of you have no problem with it?

299
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,520
I...

300
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,430
I agree with
Headmaster's and Master's arrangement.

301
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,280
Alright, make sure you get enough rest.

302
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,110
There will be even harder trials

303
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:40,920
waiting for you tomorrow.

304
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:41,720
Go!

305
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,520
Let's go.

306
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,480
Come on, Wu.

307
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:43,960
Go back and rest.

308
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,080
Have a good rest.

309
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,230
Gang.

310
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,960
Have you told Hu Lie Na

311
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,480
about Su Yun Tao's death?

312
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,280
I will find the right time to talk to her.

313
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,190
This could be an issue.

314
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,630
What if they blame

315
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,960
his death on you?

316
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,720
I only stumbled upon it by chance.

317
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,430
Also, I don't have the power

318
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,960
to kill an officer from Martial Soul Hall.

319
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,870
But you saw the killer,

320
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,000
and you chased after him.

321
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,080
Wouldn't you be curious too?

322
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:15,910
That's true.

323
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,910
But there seems to be
a connection between the killer

324
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,000
and the Azure Bull Python.

325
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,080
Do you know how serious this is?

326
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:21,880
I know.

327
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,430
This is definitely a big scheme,

328
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,840
and it's likely

329
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:25,840
that it's also related to Martial Soul Hall.

330
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,270
No matter how big the scheme is,
it's none of your business.

331
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,640
Gang.

332
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,790
I know very well

333
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,640
your relationship

334
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,390
with the chief of Martial Soul Hall.

335
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,720
You said it yourself.

336
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,310
It was all in the past.

337
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,190
You'd never think of it again.

338
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,640
Right now,

339
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,030
your students are the most important.

340
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:41,910
Your disciple.

341
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,030
Leave the big things

342
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:44,960
to the big shots.

343
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,310
The people around you

344
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,480
should be more important to you,

345
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,190
don't you think so?

346
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,360
I didn't say that I'm planning to leave.

347
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,390
Why didn't you say that earlier?

348
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,720
I wouldn't have wasted my time.

349
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,360
You are right.

350
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,910
My students

351
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,150
are the most important.

352
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,960
Why isn't Brother Dai in the dorm?

353
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,270
He probably went somewhere to train.

354
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,190
Then I hope we won't bump into him.

355
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,430
You...

356
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:51,670
Both of you...

357
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,640
We...

358
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,760
We couldn't sleep,

359
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,840
so we're out to have a walk.

360
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,120
Me too.

361
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,030
I'm going that way.

362
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,670
We're going that way.

363
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,000
Didn't you want to fight?

364
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,270
What's this?

365
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,390
You wouldn't have come if I hadn't said that.

366
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,840
Come on, then.

367
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,080
I'm ready.

368
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,080
You should enter first, and force the worm out.

369
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,150
The process will be slightly painful.

370
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,960
But I have already added enough herbs

371
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,720
to offset the pain.

372
00:19:31,187 --> 00:19:32,270
You just need to retain your Soul Power.

373
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,390
If you get hurt,

374
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,550
there is medicine.

375
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,880
Have you made up your mind?

376
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,670
Bu Le gave us the medicine.

377
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,720
My dad was harmed by him.

378
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,830
I must avenge my dad.

379
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,800
We'll go together.

380
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,280
Don't worry, Brother San.

381
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,310
Your company is good enough.

382
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,640
You don't have to do anything.

383
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,710
I want to take revenge

384
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,310
on him too.

385
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,560
Is it for Sister Wu?

386
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,710
I'm young,

387
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,520
but I can tell.

388
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:10,710
Sister Wu

389
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,430
didn't look good before our trip

390
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,400
to the Star Forest.

391
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,280
So you've already known about it.

392
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,110
To be precise,

393
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,110
all of us knew it.

394
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,470
So all of you have actually known it.

395
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:24,830
Brother San.

396
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:26,800
I know

397
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,350
that you were worried about our safety.

398
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,000
So you went to Star Town in advance.

399
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,590
I kept it from you.

400
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:34,830
I am sorry.

401
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,400
Brother Dai has said it.

402
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,760
We are the Seven Devils of Shi Lan Ke.

403
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,430
Don't

404
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,230
leave us alone.

405
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,230
Seven Devils of Shi Lan Ke forever.

406
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,680
Let's go.

407
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,280
Retain your Soul Power.

408
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,110
Otherwise, you might die.

409
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,160
It's coming out.

410
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,560
What are you doing?

411
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,110
Do you still have the strength?

412
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:15,950
Do me a favor.

413
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,710
When I force the worm out later,

414
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,560
kill it for me.

415
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,640
It's out.

416
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,950
Are you alright?

417
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:42,710
I'm fine.

418
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,070
You intended to send me to death.

419
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:50,830
Right?

420
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,470
I really didn't lie to you.

421
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,830
Only people from the headquarters

422
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,470
can cure that poison.

423
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,230
Spare me! Spare me!

424
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,110
Spare me!

425
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,000
You weren't poisoned.

426
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:02,830
As a brother

427
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,350
who didn't protect his sister,

428
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,310
I'm here to avenge my sister.

429
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,190
Spare me.

430
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,680
Spare me, please.

431
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,310
What do you want, Ma Hong Jun?

432
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,800
Remember.

433
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,710
Had it not been for me,

434
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,230
you wouldn't have got the Phoenix Soul.

435
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,520
Don't.

436
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,280
I don't want the Phoenix Soul.

437
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,000
Had it not been for you,

438
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,350
my dad wouldn't have been tortured.

439
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,160
He wouldn't have died.

440
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,640
But you have already become stronger.

441
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,310
It's not what I want.

442
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I can compensate you.

443
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:42,920
Compensate me?

444
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,230
Can your compensation bring my dad back to life?

445
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,830
I...

446
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,880
I can compensate you with money.

447
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,310
I can buy a big house for you.

448
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,950
Alright?

449
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,640
Home is about the people,

450
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,190
not the house.

451
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,760
He can't return.

452
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,430
This boy is going berserk.

453
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,470
Release me!

454
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,800
Hurry and release me!

455
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,430
He's going berserk!

456
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,110
Someone like you

457
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,160
will not come to a good end.

458
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,430
Brother San.

459
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,040
I almost killed him.

460
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,350
I don't want to become someone like him.

461
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,040
Hong Jun.

462
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,880
You did well.

463
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,680
We will have hatred and anger

464
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,760
towards people who hurt us.

465
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,110
We will even want revenge.

466
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,350
This is human nature.

467
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,350
But you did well

468
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,070
in the hut.

469
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,310
You weren't blinded by your hatred,

470
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,230
and did not act recklessly.

471
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,280
Brother San.

472
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,710
What should I do next?

473
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,760
From today on,

474
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,310
you need to work even harder

475
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,230
in your studies and training.

476
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,760
Never give up.

477
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,560
Be stronger from inside out

478
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,070
and create a world that belongs to you.

479
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,280
Alright.

480
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,310
From now on,

481
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,190
I will train harder.

482
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,160
Good.

483
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,590
Let's go back to school.

484
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,680
Master Ye!

485
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,950
Why are you here?

486
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:55,040
You did well

487
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,350
in Suo Tuo City.

488
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:59,560
I was just

489
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,190
doing my job.

490
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,350
I dare not be greedy for praises.

491
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,040
I dare not.

492
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,560
Do you know

493
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,470
what our main objective is now?

494
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,430
It is to keep a low profile.

495
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,310
Yet, at present,

496
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,280
how many people

497
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,000
have already known about your existence?

498
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,430
Even Martial Soul Hall

499
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,590
has started investigating us.

500
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,920
It must be Shi Lan Ke School's fault.

501
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,710
No worries.

502
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,070
We can kill them.

503
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,400
We can destroy the school.

504
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,110
Kill everyone in the school?

505
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,640
Actually, I just need to kill you.

506
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,590
Of course, I've thought about it.

507
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,520
Perhaps one day,

508
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,880
I'll share the same fate as yours.

509
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,680
One person is missing.

510
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,830
Well...

511
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,830
Brother Dai is...

512
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,310
I'm here.

513
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,920
I can't believe Brother Dai
is here for Master's class.

514
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,800
As Headmaster requested,

515
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,430
from today on,

516
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,110
I will be giving you Strength Up training.

517
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,230
If anyone thinks I'm unqualified,

518
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:43,950
and does not want to attend my class,

519
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:44,920
he can quit.

520
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,880
I won't stop you.

521
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,110
I'm the same.

522
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,230
Alright then.

523
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,160
Since none of you

524
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,040
are quitting now,

525
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,800
no one can ever quit later.

526
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,190
Dai Mu Bai, you're the captain.

527
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,400
Everyone's attendance and discipline.

528
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:05,979
Your responsibility.

529
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:06,670
Alright.

530
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,480
The following training

531
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,120
will definitely let all of you become stronger.

532
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,720
As long as you are able to persevere.

533
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,150
Master.

534
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,270
Will the training be very difficult?

535
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,030
Our first lesson is coming up.

536
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,840
Let me warn you.

537
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,550
This may be extremely difficult

538
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,270
for some of you.

539
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,190
What's this for?

540
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,390
Are you going to cook us?

541
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,550
I think this is too difficult.

542
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,030
Have a look.

543
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:42,760
It smells great.

544
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,430
This is our first lesson?

545
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:47,720
How is this difficult?

546
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,790
I can eat five bowls in a row.

547
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:49,840
Master.

548
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,840
Can we eat as much as we want?

549
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,480
Each person gets a bowl. Fill it up yourself.

550
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,720
Pour the soup until it reaches the rim of the bowl.

551
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,880
No fewer than three pieces of meat.

552
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,310
No fewer than four pieces of vegetable.

553
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,310
Finish everything.

554
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,640
This is the first lesson.

555
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,390
Come on.

556
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:00,880
Have breakfast.

557
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,670
I'll go first.

558
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,760
I'll fill it up for everyone.

559
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,080
Headmaster is usually stingy.

560
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,550
We don't get meat often.

561
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,910
We can only have it once a week.

562
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,760
I must eat as much as I can today.

563
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:10,880
Come, Hong Jun.

564
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,910
Eat as much as you can.

565
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,910
Just don't eat less than the amount I mentioned.

566
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:15,960
Hurry, hurry.

567
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,190
Was anyone left out?

568
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,240
Here, Rong Rong.

569
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,670
Wu.

570
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Wu, take the bowl.

571
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,670
It's hot.

572
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:26,310
Hurry, hurry.

573
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,550
Hurry.

574
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,640
Be careful, it's hot.

575
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,790
Master.

576
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,080
I'll vomit if I eat meat.

577
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:37,880
You?

578
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,080
I'm on diet.

579
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,310
I won't be eating.

580
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,640
If you don't eat,

581
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,600
you can drop out now.

582
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,240
Is it hard to understand my words?

583
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,360
I'll speak to Headmaster!

584
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,390
It's pointless to speak to him!

585
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,190
If you let him know

586
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,880
that you wasted all the money on the meat,

587
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,030
I don't think he will

588
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:55,910
show his respect to Chief Ning.

589
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,640
He will kick you out immediately.

590
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,480
What kind of lesson is this?

591
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,840
Eating meat and drinking soup.

592
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,960
How does it help to increase Soul Power?

593
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,360
It does help.

594
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,430
This smells so good.

595
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,390
This soup is based

596
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,640
on the secret recipe
of the royal family of Xing Lou.

597
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,720
It helps the Soul Power grow,

598
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,880
and also strengthens it.

599
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,510
That's amazing.

600
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:13,430
Have some.

601
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,240
How do you know?

602
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,640
I am from Xing Luo.

603
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:17,480
I can prove it.

604
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,600
The secret recipe
of the royal family of Xing Lou?

605
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:21,880
From tomorrow on,

606
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,960
you will have this for breakfast every day.

607
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:26,760
Master.

608
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,910
I will really vomit if I eat meat.

609
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,360
Lift up the bowl.

610
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,150
Eat it now.

611
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:38,840
Wu.

612
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,910
Continue to eat it after you finish vomiting.

613
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,310
A Soul Master's journey is full of danger.

614
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,600
If you can't even take this,

615
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,150
you don't have to stay here.

616
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,080
I can do it.

617
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,600
The Strength Up training is right ahead.

618
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,880
Keep up, everyone.

619
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,790
-How far is it?
-Where is it?

620
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,120
Just follow Master.

621
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,760
Wu.

622
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:34,640
Come with me.

623
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,030
What is it?

624
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,190
Adapt to breakfast slowly.

625
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:51,670
Here.

626
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,030
I wrapped this radish up with my grass net.

627
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,840
No one knows it.

628
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,310
Hurry and eat.

629
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,240
You're the best, Tang Sang.

630
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,150
I'm starving.

631
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:58,760
Slowly.

632
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,640
This grass net is so special!

633
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,550
Give it back to me.

634
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,080
Why are you here?

635
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,190
This is my Third Soul Skill.

636
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,080
Constraint of Spider Web.

637
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,190
Spider web?

638
00:32:07,729 --> 00:32:09,030
Then it's related to the Human Faced Demon Spider.

639
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,880
You used your Soul Skill to help her hide a radish?

640
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,910
So wasteful.

641
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,080
We can make a deal.

642
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,000
Give one to me.

643
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:15,550
This...

644
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,510
Give one to me, please.

645
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,240
Give one to me.

646
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,960
Then this time I hid the radish for Wu,

647
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:19,880
keep it a secret.

648
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,640
Don't worry. I'm good at keeping secrets.

649
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:22,790
Don't you know me?

650
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,480
Come on, let me see.

651
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,760
Enough. Give me your hand.

652
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,030
My hand.

653
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,600
The grass net has great adhesiveness.

654
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,080
This means your control is good.

655
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,640
So Constraint of Spider Web can give a net form

656
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,360
to Blue Silver Plant.

657
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
You can use it

658
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,080
to entrap your opponent in the arena.

659
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,000
Ou Si Ke.

660
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:50,640
You've been paying attention
to combat these days.

661
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,120
You want to give up your dream, and become

662
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:52,790
a Soul Master?

663
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:54,960
I'm in the Support Branch.

664
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:55,600
Even if I train hard,

665
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,910
I won't be able to participate in combat.

666
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,270
But Wu,

667
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,270
you really have to work hard.

668
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:00,840
Among the seven of us,

669
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,120
you're the only one with one Soul Ring.

670
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,120
I already have Triple Soul Rings.

671
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,550
When did you advance?

672
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,430
In the Star Forest.

673
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,000
Weren't you captured by the Titan Giant Ape?

674
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,150
He released me afterwards.

675
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,670
You wouldn't have time to kill Soul Beasts!

676
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,640
Titan Giant Ape

677
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,120
stepped on a Soul Beast.

678
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,760
It was dying,

679
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,430
so I just finished it off.

680
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,640
Then I advanced.

681
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,720
No way, Wu.

682
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,270
You only had one Soul Ring.

683
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,360
Now you have three.

684
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,550
Actually, Titan Giant Ape

685
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,310
stepped on two Soul Beasts!

686
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:41,550
Impossible.

687
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,670
I've never heard

688
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,270
about advancing two Soul Rings consecutively.

689
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,430
It's totally impossible!

690
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,910
I have no idea.

691
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,030
What are your two Soul Skills?

692
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,670
Second Soul Skill.

693
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:55,760
Look here.

694
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:02,640
Long eyelashes, beautiful eyes.

695
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:03,960
Well...

696
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,600
That's not the point now, you...

697
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,840
Your eyes turned pink.

698
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,080
Ou Si Ke, I think I felt dizzy.

699
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,160
Me too.

700
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,310
Was that a spiritual attack?

701
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,230
Primary Charm that causes short-term dizziness.

702
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,360
Surprise attack.

703
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,950
It's a really useful Soul Skill.

704
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,680
Next, my Third Soul Skill.

705
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,400
I'm here!

706
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:43,270
Don't yell.

707
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,680
You went really fast.

708
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,990
How did you come over?

709
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:48,440
No way.

710
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,750
It was not just speed.

711
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,030
Was it Teleport?

712
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,080
Teleport?

713
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,750
Your Soul Skill is unbelievable.

714
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,470
Wu, are you done eating?

715
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,030
We should go.

716
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,160
I'm done.

717
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,470
This is incredible.

718
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,030
Let's go.

719
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:00,710
Let's go.

720
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,160
Get ready for class!

721
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,120
Time for class.

722
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,880
Each of you, carry one.

723
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,310
Then continue running ahead.

724
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,440
You can only turn around when you see the sign.

725
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,230
Make a round trip before lunch.

726
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:22,880
Do I have to run too?

727
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:23,840
Yes.

728
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,550
Each basket is labelled with one of our names.

729
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,790
Brother Dai's, Tang San's,

730
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,440
and Ma Hong Jun's basket are the heaviest.

731
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,840
Mine, Zhu Zhu Qing's, and Wu's weigh the same.

732
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,640
Yours is the lightest.

733
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,080
I'd look ugly carrying this.

734
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,360
If you don't return by lunchtime,

735
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,550
you won't get lunch.

736
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,310
No lunch?

737
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,840
Qibao Amber Pagoda.

738
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,880
