=Episode 16=

14
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,470
My dad told me

15
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:46,790
that Support Branch Soul Masters

16
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,560
aren't strong fighters,

17
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
so what we need to do

18
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,150
is to find a partner

19
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,790
whom we can entrust our life.

20
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,710
Only then can we

21
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,200
make full use

22
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,200
of our power.

23
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,710
I've been thinking

24
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:00,790
where I can

25
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:01,750
find a partner like this.

26
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,790
By hiring them?

27
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,920
By entering into contracts?

28
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,470
Neither is the answer.

29
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,790
If you were to entrust with life,

30
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,430
that's impossible to do so.

31
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,390
But when I came all the way here,

32
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,590
I've figured it all out.

33
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,000
Like Ou Si Ke,

34
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,720
he entrusted his life to his partners.

35
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,000
In exchange, they now shared
a common destiny.

36
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,950
If you don't abandon them
in desperation,

37
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,640
they will never give up on you.

38
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,160
So what?

39
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,230
In the end, they will all die.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,560
But...

41
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,640
But if you are

42
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,470
unwilling to give,

43
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,590
how could you expect them

44
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,030
to treat you with sincerity?

45
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,280
They're dead.

46
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,590
What's the point of saying these?

47
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,950
Stop!

48
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,750
Sir, you're here.

49
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,030
Human Faced Demon Spider's legs
grow as the years go by.

50
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,310
Judging from its legs,

51
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,200
it had lived for 2,000 years.

52
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:15,920
Great.

53
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,160
No, it's not.

54
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,670
According to my calculation,

55
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,440
the limit of your Third Soul Ring

56
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,670
is around 1,700 years.

57
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,030
It has

58
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,030
exceeded your limit.

59
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,670
If you forcibly absorb it,

60
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:25,670
you'll die for sure.

61
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,590
Sir, I have no choice.

62
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,200
Tomorrow, Du Gu Yan, a Soul Master

63
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,030
will go to Star Forest.

64
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,950
She plans to kill a Soul Beast,

65
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,200
and level up to Triple Soul Rings.

66
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,830
[Your mission is
to find a way to meet her]

67
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,310
and break this bottle

68
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,750
in front of her.

69
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,870
What does she look like?

70
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,670
She'll wear a cherry
blossom petal on her head.

71
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,640
You will recognize her immediately.

72
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,830
It's you.

73
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,360
Do you know me?

74
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,280
Kid,

75
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,640
you heard what he said.

76
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,560
You can't withstand this Soul Ring.

77
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,720
Let's negotiate.

78
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,000
Give the Human Faced Demon Spider to me.

79
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,390
But I'm the one who killed it.

80
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,520
No one can absorb it

81
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,080
other than me.

82
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,230
I know.

83
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,920
All I want is its corpse.

84
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,830
Its blood contains notorious poison,

85
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,870
and is able to attract
poisonous Soul Beasts,

86
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,640
for which it's perfect for this young lady.

87
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,030
However,

88
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,150
if you absorb its Soul Ring,

89
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,310
the corpse would disappear.

90
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,310
Of course,

91
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,430
I'm not taking advantage of you.

92
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,550
If you leave it here,

93
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,520
I promise

94
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,270
to capture another
Soul Beast that suits you,

95
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,800
and I assure you that
you will level up to Triple Soul Rings.

96
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,270
How is it?

97
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,520
The people who were with him

98
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,920
snatched my
Phoenix Tail Crest Serpent just now.

99
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,840
After all, we are the elders,

100
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,750
don't take advantage of the kids.

101
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,710
There's nothing to lose in this deal.

102
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,080
Take it.

103
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,400
I can give it to you,

104
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,240
under one condition.

105
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,550
Shoot.

106
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,710
One of my friends is captured
by a Soul Beast.

107
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,840
Save her,

108
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,120
and I'll give it to you.

109
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,030
What kind of Soul Beast?

110
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,470
Titan Giant Ape.

111
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,590
It went that way.

112
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,360
Kid.

113
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,310
I'm afraid

114
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,120
your friend is dead.

115
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,640
Titan Giant Ape is fierce and violent.

116
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,990
Humans can never fight it.

117
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,680
It's meaningless even if I catch it.

118
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,680
Is that a no then?

119
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,800
If you want to level up
to Triple Soul Rings,

120
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,150
we'll exchange for a Soul Beast.

121
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,200
How long does it take?

122
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,990
First, I have to use
Human Faced Demon Spider

123
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,590
to attract poisonous Soul Beasts,

124
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,750
then this young lady
has the priority to choose.

125
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,750
Then I'll find another one for you.

126
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,800
I guess it will take some time.

127
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,430
No way.

128
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,240
I'm running out of time.

129
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,470
Don't act rashly.

130
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,520
You might die.

131
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,550
Sir.

132
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,710
The one who got caught is Wu.

133
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,590
Tang San!

134
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:13,960
Tang San!

135
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,310
Tang San!

136
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:18,800
Tang San!

137
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,310
Wu.

138
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,520
Wu.

139
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,520
Tang San!

140
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,240
I'm running out of time.

141
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:43,800
Tang San!

142
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,030
Tang San!

143
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:45,400
What's wrong?

144
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,400
It exceeded his limit,

145
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,920
his body definitely couldn't take it in.

146
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,200
Can we help?

147
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,360
He is on his own.

148
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:54,800
Tang San!

149
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:00,870
What is it?

150
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,360
What's wrong?

151
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,990
I saw a plume of green smoke

152
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,870
coming out of his body

153
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,310
and got into her arm.

154
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,960
How do you feel?

155
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,870
Nothing.

156
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,270
Did you really see it?

157
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,520
Ask him when he's awake.

158
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,430
No!

159
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,430
What is it?

160
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,400
You hit him too hard!

161
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,870
What if you hurt Tang San?

162
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:24,680
Er Ming.

163
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,840
You seem taller now.

164
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,400
What is happening?

165
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:34,990
Is he turning into a butterfly?

166
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,960
Human Faced Demon Spider's strength

167
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,800
is too strong for him.

168
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,870
It is affecting his body.

169
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,910
Has he failed in
absorbing the Soul Ring?

170
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,040
Not yet.

171
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,750
We'll only know after the cocoon breaks.

172
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,960
It's a one-in-a-million chance

173
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,910
to survive

174
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,670
this kind of ordeal.

175
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,640
Let's go.

176
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,350
We'll get you another Soul Beast.

177
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,990
But I want to wait for the result.

178
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,280
Stand further away then.

179
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,640
He might blow himself up anytime.

180
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,110
Er Ming, it's done!

181
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,200
Thank you, Er Ming!

182
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,750
No need.

183
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,350
It's enough.

184
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,400
Now their highest rank is
Triple Soul Rings.

185
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,310
It would be inappropriate

186
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:07,960
if I leveled up too fast.

187
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,790
Okay, okay.

188
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,600
I understand.

189
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,910
I didn't tell anyone

190
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,790
that I can absorb Soul Ring.

191
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,720
It's a secret to keep.

192
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:16,840
Okay.

193
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,670
I have to leave.

194
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,400
Say hello to Da Ming for me.

195
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,990
I don't want to go, either.

196
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,750
But

197
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,430
I will visit you

198
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,670
whenever I have the chance.

199
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,350
Okay?

200
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,230
Come on.

201
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,910
I really have to leave,

202
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,040
otherwise, Tang San would be worried.

203
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,080
Bye.

204
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,790
Please stop.

205
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,400
Okay, fine.

206
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,350
I give in.

207
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,750
Hide yourself

208
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:54,520
when I'm safe.

209
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,550
Don't let them see you.

210
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,640
Why hasn't he come out yet?

211
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,040
He either blows up,

212
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,110
or

213
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,350
he has turned into a corpse.

214
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,750
No way.

215
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,600
He will never die here.

216
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,310
How many of those are alive

217
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,910
after a backfire from the Soul Power?

218
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,400
There is always a miracle.

219
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,520
It's a miracle

220
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,840
because it's doesn't happen easily.

221
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:31,990
He is responding.

222
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,550
He is alive.

223
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,790
There is a miracle.

224
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,990
Take your time, no rush.

225
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,110
Tang San!

226
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,600
What happened to him?

227
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,550
The Soul Power is too strong,

228
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,350
it changes his temperament.

229
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,840
The power of Human Faced Demon Spider
has overridden him.

230
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,080
A monster like this

231
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,550
can never be left alive.

232
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,550
He cannot be saved.

233
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,280
Kill him.

234
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,040
Don't!

235
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,840
There's a way!

236
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:30,910
Move.

237
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,280
Tang San!

238
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,350
Move!

239
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,160
He is my student.

240
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:39,960
The Soul Power has backfired,

241
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,870
and he has lost his mind.

242
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,520
He is now a monster.

243
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,230
There's a way to save him.

244
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,550
There was no precedent of revival

245
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,040
among those overridden by the Soul Power.

246
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,200
I believe in him.

247
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,080
Even if there's a way,

248
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,600
he has run away.

249
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,600
Brother Dai.

250
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,400
This...

251
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,110
Tang...

252
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,600
What happened to Tang San?

253
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,790
Bring him under control first.

254
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,910
Ou Si Ke, help us.

255
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,080
Ou Si Ke, what are you doing?

256
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,040
Ou Si Ke!

257
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,480
He's strong.

258
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,110
Come on!

259
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,870
Hold it down.

260
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,670
Qibao Amber Pagoda.

261
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,790
Strength Boost!

262
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,840
I feel like I'm much stronger.

263
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,600
Me too.

264
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,670
Of course.

265
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,720
My Qibao Amber Pagoda

266
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,960
can double your strength.

267
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,750
Why are you back?

268
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,160
The Support Branch Soul Masters of Ning Family

269
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,230
will never abandon their partners.

270
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,430
What's wrong with him?

271
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,640
Why are you holding him down?

272
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,110
Why are there legs
growing out of his back?

273
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,960
It's the backfire of Soul Power.

274
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,400
He killed Human Faced Demon Spider

275
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,160
and absorbed its Soul Ring.

276
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,750
But its power

277
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,040
has exceeded his limit.

278
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,200
His temperament
is controlled by the beast nature.

279
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,200
In fact, the spider legs
are the Soul Bones.

280
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,670
What is a Soul Bone?

281
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,160
When a strong Soul Beast is killed,

282
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,640
there is a small chance that
the Soul Bones would be left behind

283
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,280
and attach to the Soul Master.

284
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,670
Tang San's current situation

285
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,400
is caused by the overflowing power
within and outside his body.

286
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,520
If we take the Soul Bones away,

287
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,400
most of the Soul Power can be removed.

288
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,230
He might regain consciousness.

289
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,550
But the Soul Bones are attached to him,

290
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,400
so they share the Soul Master's body.

291
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,280
If we remove them forcefully,

292
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,720
Tang San would stay at
Triple Soul Rings forever.

293
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,870
There's no chance of leveling up.

294
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,230
He would be ruined.

295
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,550
Exactly.

296
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,200
Brother San.

297
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,990
Wake up.

298
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,310
You'll be fine
if you regain consciousness.

299
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:43,750
Tang San.

300
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,670
He's just a bloodthirsty beast now.

301
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,720
He can't hear you.

302
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,790
Let me remove the Soul Bones.

303
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,670
You're his teacher.

304
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,870
He trusts you.

305
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,670
But if what you said is true,

306
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,550
and if he can never level up again,

307
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,990
do you think he can accept it?

308
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,400
I don't want that too.

309
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,720
But there's hope as long as he's alive.

310
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,430
It's better to stay at
Triple Soul Rings for life,

311
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,230
than being disoriented like this.

312
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,230
A Soul Master who can
never become stronger

313
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,110
has no dignity of life.

314
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,670
I know this better than you.

315
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:07,840
I'm a Soul Master

316
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,160
who will never advance.

317
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,990
But the dignity of a Soul Master

318
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,350
is not about
leveling up and fighting only.

319
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:16,550
Save him first.

320
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,600
We can talk later.

321
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:20,640
Great.

322
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,910
The Soul Bones just appeared,

323
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,110
and they have yet to grow into his body,

324
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,480
otherwise we can't remove them.

325
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,960
If you can't do it,

326
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,640
I can do it for you.

327
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,550
He is my student.

328
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,080
I'll do it myself.

329
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,910
Wu.

330
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,280
Can you hear that?

331
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,550
Brother San is awake. He is talking.

332
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,400
Wu.

333
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,110
I heard him.

334
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,550
He is calling Wu.

335
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,080
Great.

336
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,550
He'll be fine if he wakes up.

337
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,640
Quick, let go.

338
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,640
Brother San is awake.

339
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,840
Is he awake?

340
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,720
Tang San.

341
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,430
Can you hear me?

342
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,350
Regaining consciousness
even after the backfire of Soul Power.

343
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,200
You have created a miracle.

344
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,280
Wu.

345
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:08,870
Okay.

346
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,670
Wake up.

347
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,280
We will go to save Wu later.

348
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,550
Wu.

349
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,200
Gang, Tang San...

350
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:21,870
He is not awake.

351
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,670
He is controlled by the beast nature,

352
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,110
but his strong wish still exists.

353
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,520
He has always wanted to save Wu.

354
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,520
This wish has suppressed

355
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,350
the nature of killing.

356
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,280
You stay here. Let's go.

357
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:33,640
Okay.

358
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,080
If Titan Giant Ape is ahead,

359
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,990
we're seeking for death
if we follow them.

360
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,200
If saving Sister Wu

361
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,790
is Brother San's wish,

362
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,520
I'd like to help him with that.

363
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,040
Wait for me.

364
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,110
Hey.

365
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,280
Stay here.

366
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,520
A Support Branch Soul Master
can never abandon her partners,

367
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,400
even if they are lunatic.

368
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,200
Slow down.

369
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,600
Why are you running so fast?

370
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,870
What if a Soul Beast

371
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,520
comes out of nowhere attacks me?

372
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,200
You should leave now.

373
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,910
We'll be in trouble if they see us.

374
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,270
Right.

375
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:15,790
Also,

376
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,670
if you run into my friends,

377
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,880
don't hurt them.

378
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,670
They are good people.

379
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,840
Go back, Er Ming.

380
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,000
Remember me to Da Ming.

381
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:41,840
I'm fine.

382
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,030
Don't hurt him.

383
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,120
Wu.

384
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,080
Wu.

385
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,720
Headmaster.

386
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,480
Master.

387
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,910
You escaped.

388
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,360
The Titan Giant Ape didn't hurt me.

389
00:17:58,910 --> 00:17:59,880
What happened to Tang San?

390
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,200
Wu.

391
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
It's the backfire of Soul Power.

392
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,840
Backfire?

393
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,270
Wu.

394
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,240
Let me save him.

395
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:12,960
No.

396
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,480
He is not Tang San anymore.

397
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,840
But he is calling my name.

398
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,360
His last wish is to save you.

399
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,200
But sadly,

400
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,240
he can't recognize you anymore.

401
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,200
That's weird.

402
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,480
Why didn't Titan Giant Ape fight back?

403
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,360
What can we do to save him?

404
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,840
Remove the Soul Bones.

405
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,360
Let me try.

406
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,510
If I die in the hand of Titan Giant Ape,

407
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,150
promise me

408
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,630
to take them home safely.

409
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,840
Headmaster!

410
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,600
Stop.

411
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,840
Great one.

412
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,630
Soul Honour of Quadruple Soul Rings?

413
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,240
Among all
Soul Honours of Triple Soul Rings,

414
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,120
he can be considered as a great one.

415
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,000
Sister.

416
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,600
Why are you here?

417
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,310
Of course I'm here for you.

418
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,360
The Star Forest is so big,

419
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,030
how did you find me?

420
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,150
I'm worried about you.

421
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,150
Fragrance Seeking Worm.

422
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,360
Did you put it on me?

423
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,270
You traveled far alone.

424
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,270
As your elder sister,

425
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,360
I have to keep an eye on you.

426
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,840
Has anything happened in the family?

427
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:39,670
Nothing happened.

428
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,550
Why are you here then?

429
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:44,880
Aren't you here
to break off the engagement?

430
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,120
Have you told him?

431
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,150
Yes.

432
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,030
Let's go then.

433
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,270
He's dying.

434
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,480
What do you mean?

435
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,790
The honored King of Forest,

436
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,030
I'm here to bring my student home.

437
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,510
I have no intention of
fighting with you.

438
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,960
The Soul Bones

439
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,200
are going to attach to his bone.

440
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,120
They must be removed now,

441
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,150
otherwise it will be too late.

442
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,720
Is the removal dangerous?

443
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,310
He can never level up

444
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,840
and he will stay at
Triple Soul Rings for life.

445
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,080
No way!

446
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:20,550
The Soul Power in him is overflowing.

447
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,760
The Soul Bones must be removed.

448
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,430
Wu, we are saving him.

449
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,630
Overflowing of Soul Power.

450
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,790
Then we can just transfer it out.

451
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,910
How can you transfer
a Soul Master's Soul Power?

452
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,200
I know the way.

453
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,000
Wu.

454
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,000
I know you're upset,

455
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,030
but this is

456
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,430
the only way to keep him alive.

457
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:37,790
Hurry up.

458
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,670
Titan Giant Ape.

459
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,360
Darn it!

460
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,510
The King of Forest is at the outskirts.

461
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,910
Who is fighting it?

462
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,000
You said Dai Mu Bai is dying.

463
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,390
What do you mean?

464
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,390
It's none of your business.

465
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,390
Come with me.

466
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,720
Let's get this straight first.

467
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,200
I'll tell you on our way home.

468
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,600
I'm not leaving.

469
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,550
Don't throw a tantrum here.

470
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,910
I'm doing this for your own good.

471
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,600
Let's go.

472
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,760
Let her go.

473
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,430
Oh, you're awake.

474
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,030
I said, let her go.

475
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:19,510
Are you okay?

476
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,670
I'm fine.

477
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,910
Don't you know who I am?

478
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,630
This woman is strong.
You should leave first.

479
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,550
What is going on here?

480
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,360
Have you broken off your engagement?

481
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,200
Mind your own business.

482
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,430
Do you know her?

483
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,240
Where is Tang San?

484
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,550
What's with all these people?

485
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,200
How troublesome.

486
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,720
Leave him as soon as you can.

487
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,030
The roar of Titan Giant Ape

488
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,790
came from that side.

489
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,310
Let's go check it out.

490
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,270
Let's go.

491
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,270
Wu.

492
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,030
I'm here.

493
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,670
I'll remove the excessive Soul Power.

494
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:31,670
It'll be fine.

495
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,600
He doesn't remember anything now.

496
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,480
He won't know about our secret.

497
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,550
Keep an eye out for me.

498
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,760
Don't let anyone come near us.

499
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,390
The process of transferring
can't be interrupted.

500
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,910
You'll be fine in a minute.

501
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,310
No!

502
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:08,960
It can't be interrupted.

503
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,760
You have to wake up.

504
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,720
Tang San.

505
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,480
The process can't be interrupted.

506
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,480
You must make it through.

507
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,720
Tang San.

508
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,550
Leave them alone!

509
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,630
Fight with us if you dare.

510
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,120
You counted me in?

511
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,310
You can leave first.

512
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,030
Rocketing Kiwi!

513
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,600
Leave them alone!

514
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,910
You can eat my kiwi.

515
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,910
It's delicious.

516
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,080
Do you hear me?

517
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:35,760
I will fight with you.

518
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,670
Do you want a sausage?

519
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,240
[Do you want a sausage?]

520
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,630
Er Ming, go.

521
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,630
He ran away.

522
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,270
I chased it away.

523
00:24:59,030 --> 00:24:59,720
Wu.

524
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,000
Tang San.

525
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,630
You...

526
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,760
Wake up.

527
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,550
What happened?

528
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,240
Where is Titan Giant Ape?

529
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,480
I chased it away with my kiwi.

530
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,310
Miss,

531
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,310
can you lend me a hand?

532
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,430
Here.

533
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,960
Can you help to treat Wu's wound?

534
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:16,790
Both of you are girls,

535
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,880
it would be more convenient.

536
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,910
Is she Wu?

537
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,080
Are the wounds

538
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,790
caused by the spider's legs?

539
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,430
I don't know.

540
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,880
She's already injured when I got here.

541
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,600
Didn't he come to save Wu?

542
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,000
Why would he hurt her?

543
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,600
He was deluded by the beast nature,

544
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,240
how could he remember his old friend?

545
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,030
Both of them fainted.

546
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,430
It's not a life-threatening situation.

547
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,240
Let me remove the Soul Bones for him.

548
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,270
It disappeared.

549
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,960
The Soul Bones have
integrated into his body.

550
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,150
What does it mean?

551
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,720
Unless he's dead,

552
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,480
otherwise it can never be extracted.

553
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,120
We're late.

554
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,030
What should we do?

555
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,630
Kill him.

556
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,200
Ma Hong Jun.

557
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,630
Brother Dai.

558
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,030
Wu.

559
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:13,720
What happened?

560
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,840
The Soul Bones

561
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,720
have completely integrated into him.

562
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,080
He can never be saved.

563
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:18,910
Killing him

564
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,630
is setting him free.

565
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,430
I won't let you kill Brother San.

566
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,600
Tang San is a student of Shi Lan Ke School.

567
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:25,670
We will decide what to do

568
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,120
when Headmaster is awake.

569
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,000
He almost got away just now.

570
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,550
If I kill him,

571
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,200
it's better than letting
your Headmaster suffer.

572
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,630
Do you really want to kill him?

573
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,270
He is a monster now.

574
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:37,910
Wait.

575
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,960
My father is Ning Feng Zhi.

576
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,720
Is your father the chief of
Qibao Amber Clan?

577
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,550
Yes.

578
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,310
Why would the young daughter
of the three elders

579
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,000
hang out with these people?

580
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,760
Sir.

581
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,200
For the sake of my father,

582
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,840
please don't kill him now.

583
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,080
Even if your father is here,

584
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,390
he would kill him too.

585
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,550
Let me repeat myself.

586
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,080
He's no longer a human now.

587
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,000
He...

588
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,310
Wu.

589
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,310
Wu.

590
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,120
He's awake.

591
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,360
Where is Titan Giant Ape?

592
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,600
Sir.

593
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,720
Can you recognize me?

594
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,310
It's just a Human Faced Demon Spider.

595
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,120
You're the Great Soul Land Master
with Eight Soul Rings.

596
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,720
You don't have to kill me for that.

597
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:27,390
What's wrong with you?

598
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,480
Why aren't you talking?

599
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,480
Wait, don't you remember what happened?

600
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,510
Wu.

601
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,120
Wu.

602
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,270
She's not dead.

603
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,670
It's just a minor injury.

604
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,270
We have stopped the bleeding.

605
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,880
Did Titan Giant Ape hurt her?

606
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,790
As I know, you're the one who hurt her.

607
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,670
Let her get some rest.

608
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,430
She's not awake yet.

609
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,760
She will be fine later.

610
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,960
Kid, come here.

611
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,150
I can't believe that
you're totally fine.

612
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,790
How did you revive?

613
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,840
I can't remember.

614
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,510
My last memory is that
I absorbed the Soul Ring.

615
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,310
Then when I opened my eyes,
you wanted to kill me.

616
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,790
No one has ever healed by themselves

617
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,550
after the backfire of Martial Soul.

618
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,600
Kid,

619
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,480
show me your Martial Soul.

620
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,430
You've leveled up to Triple Soul Rings.

621
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,600
He is truly recovered.

622
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,760
This...

623
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,510
This doesn't make sense at all.

624
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,670
Kid,

625
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,240
what's with the green smoke

626
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,840
that came out of your body?

627
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,510
Green smoke? What is it?

628
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:05,120
Could it be that I made a mistake?

629
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,310
That's it.

630
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:07,550
Let's go.

631
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,670
What green smoke was she talking about?

632
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,310
The Serpent said
when Du Gu Yan touched you,

633
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,600
there was a plume of
green smoke coming out of your body.

634
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,120
She touched me?

635
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,600
You were unconscious at that time.

636
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:43,960
Oh, no!

637
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,270
They walked too fast.

638
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,150
I was thinking about Wu,

639
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,200
and I forgot about the bottle.

640
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,310
Didn't I give it to Lander?

641
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,200
When he was fighting
with Titan Giant Ape,

642
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
the bottle dropped,

643
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,910
so I picked it up.

644
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:13,760
And then?

645
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,910
Then when I was fighting

646
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,670
the Human Faced Demon Spider,

647
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,840
the bottle was broken.

648
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,360
The green smoke in it

649
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,600
drifted onto my hand.

650
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,430
But nothing happened to me.

651
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,790
How is that possible?

652
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,510
Sir,

653
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,200
is it possible that it's not a kind of poison?

654
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,480
No way.

655
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,120
There's strong poison in the bottle.

656
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,390
If that's the case,

657
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,310
why hasn't

658
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,880
anything happened to me?

659
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:38,720
Perhaps

660
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,270
there's also poison
in Human Faced Demon Spider.

661
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,840
When you absorbed its Soul Ring,

662
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,910
it affected you as well.

663
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,000
I'll check the books at school later,

664
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,030
and I'll try to figure it out.

665
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,310
Sir, how about you?

666
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:49,310
Headmaster said

667
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,630
you went to see Su Yun Tao.

668
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,630
He's dead.

669
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,480
He's dead?

670
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,120
Who killed him?

671
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,430
I don't know.

672
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,510
That's a human figure like the black smoke..

673
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,880
I've never met a Soul Master like that.

674
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,760
But there's one thing for sure,

675
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,030
he is very strong.

676
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,430
He could even

677
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,080
talk to the King of Star Forest.

678
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,790
Did he talk to Titan Giant Ape?

679
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:10,630
No.

680
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,310
It's Azure Bull Python.

681
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,840
He had a conversation
with Azure Bull Python.

682
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,600
And then?

683
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,270
I headed out of the forest.

684
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:17,600
Then I saw you

685
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,030
getting ready to absorb the Soul Ring.

686
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,960
After I advanced,

687
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,670
I lost my control.

688
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,790
It's because of
the backfire of Soul Power.

689
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,480
So,

690
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,880
I was the one who hurt Wu.

691
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,270
You were unconscious back then.

692
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,880
It's not your fault.

693
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,790
You're not to blame for Wu's injury.

694
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,910
But I almost killed her.

695
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,910
Both of you are lucky.

696
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,270
Wu is fine.

697
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,120
You're awake.

698
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,360
Sir,

699
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,120
where is Headmaster and Brother Dai?

700
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,670
They went to the town

701
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,910
to find herbs that
can speed up Wu's recovery.

702
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,080
I'll go too.

703
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,790
They went in a group. It's enough.

704
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,360
I have to do something for her.

705
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:02,880
What kind of herbs does she need?

706
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,240
Why do you ask me to come?

707
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,510
You seem to be treating me coldly.

708
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,550
Regarding today's battle,

709
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,310
even Ning Rong Rong was there,

710
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,630
you're the only one who left.

711
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,080
We are talking about
Titan Giant Ape.

712
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,150
The smartest move is to leave.

713
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:48,910
Aren't you going to accept me

714
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,240
as your partner anymore?

715
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,630
You're right.

716
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,120
Then I'll do

717
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,910
what I have to do.

718
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,510
Relax, don't be nervous.

719
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:15,870
That's right.

720
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,800
Tell me everything

721
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,830
about your family.

722
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:40,800
What happened to me?

723
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,200
She is using the spiritual ability on you.

724
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:45,630
I just want

725
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,960
to know a little more about Brother Dai.

726
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:50,960
Okay, I get it.

727
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:52,670
He's yours.

728
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,070
I won't talk to him anymore.

729
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,320
Don't talk nonsense.

730
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,590
It's not because of this.

731
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,070
What are you trying to do?

732
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,280
I just want to know
a little more about you.

733
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,670
I want to know about your past,

734
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,430
but you always reject me.

735
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,350
This is my only way.

736
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,200
If you do it again,

737
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,110
I'll kill you.

738
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:27,910
Why are you here?

739
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,320
I just passed by and
I coincidentally saw you.

740
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:33,590
Thank you.

741
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:36,670
Don't mention it.

742
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,390
Snow Return.

743
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:43,670
True Soul Flower.

744
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:45,720
You're not dead.

745
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,320
It's you.
