<i>Episode 3</i>

15
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,310
Actually,

16
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,400
I've never seen her since I was a kid.

17
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,830
I don't know whether I'm sad,

18
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,720
but I think my dad must be very sad.

19
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,510
Otherwise, he wouldn't drink every day.

20
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,360
I think

21
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,160
my mom must be

22
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,870
a gentle and soft person.

23
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,950
That's why my dad has been
feeling sad over the years.

24
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,190
Alright.

25
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:18,750
I don't know why

26
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,030
I'm telling you all these.

27
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,800
Just listen to it as a story.

28
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,110
Don't cry.

29
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,750
I'm not crying.

30
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,000
Da Ming told me

31
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,520
everyone would die.

32
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,390
As long as you remember him,

33
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,240
he will live in your heart.

34
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,320
I guess

35
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,390
your mom

36
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,800
must be living in your dad's heart.

37
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,240
They aren't separated.

38
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,110
Young Master.

39
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,030
How is it?

40
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,030
We have searched all girls' dorms

41
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,720
but we couldn't find the girl yesterday.

42
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,080
We did search thoroughly.

43
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,190
Then, let's just wait here.

44
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,440
I'm sure she needs to eat.

45
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,390
No. Listen to me.

46
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,600
Wu is really

47
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,670
not who you think she is.

48
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,720
To me, Wu

49
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,270
is a kind-hearted girl

50
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,270
with a pure soul.

51
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,190
Her thoughts are simple and direct.

52
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,190
She's like...

53
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,630
She's like a child.

54
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,270
We understand, Brother San.

55
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,160
Anything you say.

56
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,270
You...

57
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,240
Don't make things too complicated.

58
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,630
We understand, Brother San.

59
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,830
We won't tell anyone about

60
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,160
what happened between both of you.

61
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,270
Brother Wang.

62
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,030
Sister Wu was stopped
by Young Master Xiao.

63
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,670
You really don't remember me?

64
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,520
We met at the entrance yesterday.

65
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,320
Wu.

66
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,080
Tang San.

67
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,800
Over here.

68
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,270
They said we can dine for free here.

69
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,320
It's you again, Brother Tang.

70
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,720
Do you know them, Wu?

71
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,800
He said we met yesterday.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,030
But I don't remember.

73
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,520
You're Wu, right?

74
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,360
Why are you with people

75
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,030
from Dorm Seven?

76
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,470
I'm their boss.

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,350
You're their boss?

78
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes.

79
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,670
You're good at telling jokes.

80
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,600
I'm not telling jokes.

81
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,880
That's because I defeated all of them.

82
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,110
Are we done talking?

83
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:36,950
I'm hungry.

84
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,880
Let's have lunch.

85
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,160
Wait a minute.

86
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,000
What again?

87
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,510
The food in the canteen is just average.

88
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,920
There's a restaurant

89
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,480
exclusively for the
Soul Master Association.

90
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,600
You can order anything you want.

91
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,040
I am the governor's son.

92
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,830
So I can take you there with me.

93
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,550
I wonder

94
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,550
if I have the honor to do so.

95
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,950
Your father is the governor?

96
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,110
Yes.

97
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,110
I thought you're from the Xiao family.

98
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,950
So what?

99
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,950
Think about it.

100
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,670
The governor is your father
and his last name is Cheng.

101
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,000
And yours is Xiao.

102
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,720
It doesn't add up.

103
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,550
You do have the courage, little girl.

104
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,320
How dare you tease the governor.

105
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,270
What does he mean?

106
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,000
What do I mean?

107
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,160
Young Master Xiao
is showing you some respect

108
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,550
by asking you to join him.

109
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,920
Come here.

110
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,600
Brother Tang.

111
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,640
I'm treating her to lunch.

112
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,440
It has nothing to do with you, right?

113
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,510
Wu.

114
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,950
Do you want to go?

115
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:32,950
Are you going?

116
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,760
I'm not from
the Soul Master Association.

117
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,920
I'm not going.

118
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm not going, then.

119
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,440
Do you hear that?

120
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,950
She said she's not going.

121
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,160
What an ungrateful person.

122
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,480
You're so weak.

123
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
I gave you a chance, Tang San.

124
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,880
Why did you embarrass me

125
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,920
in front of so many people?

126
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,040
That's not my intention.

127
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,320
I'll give you another chance.

128
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,070
Move aside.

129
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,200
Hand her over.

130
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,320
You'd better think twice.

131
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,390
My third uncle is
the headmaster of the school.

132
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,160
Is his last name also Cheng?

133
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,600
If we're done here,

134
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,230
we shall leave for lunch.

135
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,160
Wu.

136
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,640
Let's have lunch.

137
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,510
Okay.

138
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,720
Let's have lunch, Wang Sheng.

139
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,720
Let go.

140
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,000
Give it to me.

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,790
Let go.

142
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,390
Stop it.

143
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,670
How dare you cheat.

144
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,880
Wang Sheng.

145
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,760
What's wrong with you?

146
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,350
I said I won't tell you the answer.

147
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,760
How could you grab my paper?

148
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,110
I...

149
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,920
-Why is he lying?
-You...

150
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,790
What are you talking about?

151
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,830
Sir.

152
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,320
Yes, it's my fault.

153
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,230
I didn't manage to stop Wang Sheng

154
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,950
from cheating.

155
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,320
I'm willing to be punished.

156
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,920
You copied my answer.

157
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,830
Alright.

158
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,440
Sir.

159
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,830
He took Wang Sheng's paper away.

160
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,230
I can testify.

161
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,320
Are you

162
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,720
trying to make trouble?

163
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,230
What are you doing?

164
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,200
Zero mark will be given to
Wang Sheng and Liu Long.

165
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,320
Get out now.

166
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:43,760
Sir, I...

167
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,390
Everyone else should be seated
and carry on with the test.

168
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,670
Martial Soul Fight

169
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,390
is an extraordinary skill,

170
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,440
as well as an exquisite piece of art.

171
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,200
When you go to
the Intermediate Soul Master School

172
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,480
or the Advanced Soul Master School,

173
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,160
you will have a chance to train in a team

174
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,760
at the Soul Arena.

175
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,720
Now,

176
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,160
Xiao Chen Yu

177
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,440
will demonstrate for you.

178
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,640
Please learn from him.

179
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,320
I need an opponent in the combat.

180
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,550
Tang San is a good opponent.

181
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,040
Tang San.

182
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,320
Please cooperate with Xiao Chen Yu.

183
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,080
Yes, Sir.

184
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,350
Go for it, Tang San.

185
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,110
Go for it.

186
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,670
You can do it.

187
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,280
If you stay away from Wu,

188
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,000
I will have mercy on you,

189
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,960
so you won't be too embarrassed.

190
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,200
Let's start.

191
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,840
You didn't get a good look, did you?

192
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,030
We didn't. Do it again.

193
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,640
Yes.

194
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,880
Do it again.

195
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,400
Show us again.

196
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,880
I'll demonstrate again.

197
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,080
Xuan Tian Strike!

198
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,030
Sir, they took advantage of us
just because they outnumbered us.

199
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:41,790
Alright.

200
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,590
Get back to your position.

201
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,960
Martial in general

202
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,400
is just some physical activities.

203
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,550
Now, all of you

204
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,960
hit the sandbag in front of you

205
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,790
with your Martial Soul Shield Body.

206
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,670
You must feel your own Martial Soul

207
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,960
and make it

208
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,280
a part of your body.

209
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,640
When you are extending it,

210
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,200
imagine

211
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,470
you are extending your arms and legs.

212
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,110
You have an extra pair of ears.

213
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,470
Nothing else?

214
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,110
The speed will be slightly faster.

215
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,710
It appears that Sister
Wu's beast soul is a rabbit.

216
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,640
Since I'm going to school,

217
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,400
I've decided to officially
give my Martial Soul

218
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,910
an artistic name.

219
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,550
I'll name it as
the Flexible Charming Bunny.

220
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,150
Is it nice?

221
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,110
It's cute.

222
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,590
Controlling Crane Catching Dragon!

223
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,000
You're fighting? Count me in.

224
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,320
This is outrageous.

225
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,280
You started it first.

226
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,280
Liu Long, Xiao Chen Yu
got his clothes dirty.

227
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,110
Take him back to get changed.

228
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,080
Yes.

229
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,670
It's not over yet.

230
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,670
Xiao Chen Yu is obviously
bullying us.

231
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,470
I can't believe that the teacher
didn't stop them. It's outrageous.

232
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,470
It might look like the teacher
punished both of you.

233
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,520
But in fact,

234
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,520
not only did he stop Xiao Chen Yu
from doing something merciless

235
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
to Tang San in the class,

236
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,470
he also avoided
offending those rich boys.

237
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,320
Sister Wu,

238
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,000
are you okay?

239
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,030
I'm fine.
My clothes will dry in no time.

240
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:09,880
Brother San,

241
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,910
we have work to do in the afternoon.

242
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,550
We'll get going then.

243
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,760
Go.

244
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:14,670
Wu.

245
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:14,960
Let's go.

246
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,320
What's the matter?

247
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,230
Your clothes are wet and
you might catch a cold.

248
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,400
I'll dry it for you.

249
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,080
It's warm.

250
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,550
Why is your hand as hot as fire?

251
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,350
Don't you feel hot?

252
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,280
I practice some skills every day.

253
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,110
And I develop this skill over time.

254
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,000
Please teach me.

255
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,710
Do you really want to learn it?

256
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,910
Training

257
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,280
doesn't happen overnight.

258
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,320
Turn around.

259
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,440
Let me dry the back.

260
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,350
Does that work?

261
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,840
I've set traps

262
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,400
at the left, centre

263
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,710
and right side.

264
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,000
I even covered them with fallen leaves.

265
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,320
It's as if they aren't there.

266
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm sure they won't be discovered.

267
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,760
-I...
-Now, let's wait for them to come

268
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,000
and step on

269
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,230
the firecrackers hidden
underneath the fallen leaves.

270
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,880
Then...

271
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,350
When exactly will they come?

272
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,840
It's getting late.

273
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,150
You better hurry up.

274
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,550
You're not allowed
to leave if it's not done.

275
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,550
I'll check it tomorrow morning.

276
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,110
He's annoying.

277
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,550
He doesn't even allow us to eat.
I'm so hungry.

278
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,520
Go get some rest. I'll do it.

279
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,150
You're the best, Tang San.

280
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,550
Are you crazy?

281
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,080
Are you out of your mind?

282
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,200
What are you laughing at?

283
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,400
When are they coming?

284
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,350
Soon.

285
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,550
Soon, Young Master.

286
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,280
It's done.

287
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,030
Tang San, Wu.

288
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,320
Come here.

289
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,670
It's getting late.

290
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,110
You better hurry up.

291
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,520
You're not allowed
to leave if it's not done.

292
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,520
I'll check it tomorrow morning.

293
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,030
He's annoying.

294
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,000
He doesn't even allow us to eat.
I'm so hungry.

295
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,840
Go get some rest. I'll do it.

296
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,320
You're the best, Tang San.

297
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,230
Keep moving...

298
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,790
Do me a favor, Wu.

299
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,350
Okay.

300
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,960
I will be done when you count until 100.

301
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,520
Okay.

302
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,960
One.

303
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,080
Two.

304
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:12,590
Three.

305
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,470
40.

306
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,110
45.

307
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,520
Count properly.

308
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,400
Four, five.

309
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,640
Ten.

310
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,880
They're doing that right in front of me.

311
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,200
I can't stand it anymore.

312
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,150
Don't...

313
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,910
Calm down, Young Master.

314
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,230
You must calm down, Young Master.

315
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:32,910
Calm down.

316
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,710
Who's talking?

317
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,200
I am. I am counting.

318
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,550
Carry on.

319
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,080
Okay.

320
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,440
35, 40.

321
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,710
45.

322
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,640
50.

323
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,550
55.

324
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,230
Purple Demon Eye.

325
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:53,880
60.

326
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,880
65.

327
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,110
70.

328
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,400
75.

329
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,280
There's an explosion.
Let me check it out.

330
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,080
Wu.

331
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,760
Where were you?

332
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,000
75.

333
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,150
Stop counting.

334
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,550
Let's go eat something. I'm hungry too.

335
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,230
What do you want to eat?

336
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,280
Carrot.

337
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,150
Carrot?

338
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,470
Let's go.

339
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,030
Are you done sweeping?

340
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,350
Forget about it. Eating comes first.

341
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,000
Let's go.

342
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,550
Alright, let's go.

343
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,520
We can't go out now.

344
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,400
Luckily they didn't notice us.

345
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,550
Are you stupid?

346
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,670
They already noticed us.

347
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,110
He swept the fallen leaves
and the firecrackers here.

348
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,080
But I just can't let it go.

349
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,440
Just let it go.

350
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,110
I was right.

351
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,030
Martial Soul Hall wouldn't

352
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:56,960
give a recommendation badge

353
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,910
to a useless Martial Soul.

354
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,550
Young Master.

355
00:16:59,230 --> 00:16:59,790
I think

356
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,550
he's just lulling us into
a false sense of security.

357
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,230
-Yes.
-He's...

358
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,470
He's even bullying us.

359
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,470
Yes.

360
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:06,960
No...

361
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,440
No.

362
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,640
That's not what I meant.

363
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,550
I mean

364
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,310
you are the governor's son,
Young Master.

365
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,920
You are a noble person.

366
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,920
Tang San and those attached students...

367
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,520
Who does he think he is?

368
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,110
He has been humiliating us

369
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,230
in public and in private.

370
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,110
It doesn't matter if we lose.

371
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,520
But you can't lose.

372
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,310
I am not capable of doing it now.

373
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,830
I am no match for them.

374
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,560
I can't teach them a lesson either.

375
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,920
I have an idea, Young Master.

376
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,400
Great.

377
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,190
They are disobedient.

378
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,350
I should teach them a lesson.

379
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,430
I'm sure all of you learned something

380
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,400
from the practical lesson yesterday.

381
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,710
Today,

382
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,160
I will give each of you
a one-on-one guidance

383
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,710
based on your condition

384
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,430
and I will grade you.

385
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,640
Let's start with you, Wu.

386
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,160
Okay.

387
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,160
It's great.

388
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,800
Your strength is on your legs.

389
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,230
Work on it.

390
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,160
You can choose a Soul Beast
that has strong leg power

391
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,920
like Lightning Rabbit and Jade Rabbit

392
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,350
as your first Soul Ring.

393
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,160
Must I kill a soul beast

394
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,520
to get the soul ring?

395
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,350
Yes.

396
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,350
Is there any other way?

397
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,800
There isn't.

398
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,280
It's your turn, Tang San.

399
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:53,950
Sir.

400
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,230
There haven't been any changes

401
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,000
with my Blue Silver Plant.

402
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,040
I can't launch any attacks with it.

403
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,920
I don't think that's Blue Silver Plant.

404
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,230
It's useless.

405
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,950
Can you guide me, Sir?

406
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,430
You did well in your written test.

407
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,590
And you are smart.

408
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,430
However,

409
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,070
I am inexperienced in handling

410
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,310
a useless Martial Soul
like Blue Silver Plant.

411
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,000
I can't be of any help.

412
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,040
I do not want to give up, Sir.

413
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,400
I want to be a soul master.

414
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,920
I suggest you to study
the theory of soul master.

415
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,400
Take a deep look at it.

416
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,560
When you have achievements,

417
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,470
you might be a master of theory

418
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,000
or a teacher

419
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,110
just like me.

420
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,800
I'm sure it will be useful someday.

421
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,400
Thank you, Sir.

422
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:48,880
What's with the blank look?

423
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,310
Let's practice, okay?

424
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,070
Stop thinking about it.

425
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,310
Come in.

426
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,880
I have a question, Master.

427
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,680
Why did you say the Blue Silver Plant

428
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:07,880
is not a useless Martial Soul?

429
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,070
You have 15 minutes.

430
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,110
Make it quick.

431
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,640
I have to guard the gate later.

432
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,230
Everyone says Blue Silver Plant
is a useless Martial Soul.

433
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,110
At first,

434
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,920
I think everything

435
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,680
has their features and purpose.

436
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,350
Even the most common
Martial Soul like Blue Silver Plant

437
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,190
is no exception.

438
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,160
But after training

439
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,160
for the past few days,

440
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,590
everyone's Martial Soul has improved.

441
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,310
But my Blue Silver Plant

442
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,160
is no different from the state

443
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,000
when my Martial Soul awakened.

444
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,190
Nothing has changed at all.

445
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,830
There's no useless Martial Soul,

446
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,880
there is only useless man.

447
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,160
Repeat after me.

448
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,760
There's no useless Martial Soul,

449
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,400
there is only useless man.

450
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,920
Speak louder.

451
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,160
There's no useless Martial Soul,

452
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,560
there is only useless man.

453
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,110
Inferior Martial Souls
have been a main topic

454
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,190
in my study.

455
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,230
Blue Silver Plant is one of them.

456
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,950
It's weak

457
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,520
but it does have its strength.

458
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,350
Blue Silver Plant has its strength too?

459
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:09,920
Have you ever observed

460
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,350
the form of this plant?

461
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,160
Alright. Here's an assignment for you.

462
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,430
Observe the Blue Silver Plant.

463
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,310
Controlling Crane Catching Dragon.

464
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,350
Ever since my Soul Master awakened,

465
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,520
the power of
Xuan Tian Strike hasn't improved.

466
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,000
Blue Silver Plant is also
just the same as it was.

467
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:54,800
Tang San.

468
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,880
I knew you are here.

469
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,350
Wang Sheng prepared
some hometown specialties.

470
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,520
Let's have dinner together.

471
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,160
Tang San.

472
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,310
What's so special about it?

473
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:15,880
Right. What's so special about it?

474
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,230
Yes.

475
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,230
There's nothing special
about Blue Silver Plant

476
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,070
in the first place.

477
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,920
You're a genius, Wu.

478
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,000
You are right.

479
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,070
Blue Silver Plant is too common.

480
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,520
That makes its power to puzzle

481
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,000
greater than any other Martial Souls.

482
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,400
I am satisfied with your answer.

483
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,400
Does it mean that I can get a soul ring

484
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,230
like everybody else?

485
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,760
Can I be a real soul master now?

486
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,000
Based on the analysis

487
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,190
of my study

488
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,040
on Blue Silver Plant,

489
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,040
you can be a Controlling Soul Master.

490
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,590
A Controlling Soul Master...

491
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,230
What's the power of
a Controlling Soul Master?

492
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,640
A Controlling Soul Master

493
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,470
uses his own Martial Soul
to restrict his opponent's movements,

494
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,470
in order to facilitate the attack.

495
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,520
You will learn this

496
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,040
in the class.

497
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,400
What I am going to say

498
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,430
is the theory from my study.

499
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,280
Do you want to hear it?

500
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,110
Come on.

501
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,160
Show me your Martial Soul.

502
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,110
Try to extend it.

503
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,280
I can't.

504
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,880
Empty your mind at all times

505
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,560
and get ready for
Martial Soul Shield Body.

506
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,430
Make it formless and shapeless

507
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,520
like water

508
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,160
and let it flow through your body.

509
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,760
You must coordinate
with your Martial Soul.

510
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,160
Then, it will become your ally.

511
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,590
If you fight it back,

512
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,070
it will become your enemy.

513
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,310
Try to adapt to your Martial Soul.

514
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,000
You must have faith in it.

515
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,590
Because a heart of faith

516
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,920
is your Martial Soul.

517
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,190
Have faith in it and
it will have faith in you.

518
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,640
Then, it will start to grow.

519
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,920
I really made it.

520
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,160
Don't get distracted. Keep doing it.

521
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,000
Other than

522
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,520
the commonality you mentioned earlier,

523
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,310
Blue Silver Plant has
three other strengths.

524
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,430
Firstly,

525
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,560
the usage of Blue Silver Plant

526
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,070
doesn't require much Soul Power.

527
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,160
It's even lesser than
Food Branch Martial Soul.

528
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,430
Therefore, you can use it
as much as you can

529
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,880
with your own Soul Power.

530
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:35,880
Secondly,

531
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,400
Blue Silver Plant is weak.

532
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,830
So it won't repel

533
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,760
Soul Ring of any other elements.

534
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,230
Thirdly,

535
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,070
I found out that

536
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,470
it's best for Blue Silver Plant

537
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,520
to develop into Controlling Branch.

538
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,430
This is because the plant is flexible.

539
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,590
It can be controlled

540
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,920
and turn into various forms.

541
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,830
The simplest of all,

542
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,560
it can be used as a rope

543
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,040
to tie down your enemy.

544
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,350
What should I do?

545
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:22,920
What was on your mind?

546
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,520
I got excited.

547
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,070
Think about something else.

548
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,520
I can't.

549
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,000
My mind is blank.
I can't think of anything.

550
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,430
Think about food.

551
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,470
What's your favorite food?

552
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,430
Braised pork belly.

553
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,230
Braised pork belly.

554
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,470
Why isn't it working?

555
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,920
I never had it.

556
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,800
My friends in the village told me that

557
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,640
it's the best food of all.

558
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,470
Do something, Master.

559
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:03,760
I'm sorry, Master.

560
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,680
I still can't take control of it.

561
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,880
This is common
as you are still exploring.

562
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,880
It's getting late.
Let's continue tomorrow.

563
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,000
I made a mess in your room.

564
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,470
I'll clean them up before I leave.

565
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,400
When you leave,

566
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,880
bring this bottle with you.

567
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,950
What is it?

568
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,560
It's a medicine to treat bruises.

569
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,590
I don't think I need it.

570
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,430
I did it.

571
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,350
Are you okay?

572
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,640
Why are you still up?
What are you doing?

573
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:02,230
I'm practicing Blue Silver Plant.

574
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,560
So you keep falling

575
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,920
to train your pain tolerance?

576
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:08,800
No.

577
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,920
Master told me that

578
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,070
a heart of faith is my Martial Soul.

579
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,590
I'm trying to adapt to

580
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,430
my Blue Silver Plant.

581
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,110
But

582
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,190
The teacher told us in the class that

583
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,070
our Martial Soul coexists with us.

584
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,160
We are dependent on each other.

585
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,190
So,

586
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:23,640
I think

587
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,310
even if your Martial Soul
is awakened late,

588
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,430
it has been there all along.

589
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,310
Why is there a need to adapt to it?

590
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,350
Did Master say it wrongly?

591
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,800
At least with Master's guidance,

592
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,950
my Blue Silver Plant is growing.

593
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,640
I suppose this is a progress.

594
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,680
Training alone must be bored.

595
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,950
How about I train with you?

596
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,400
Okay.

597
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,590
It won't listen to me.

598
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,560
Don't go.

599
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,400
Now I know

600
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,310
why Master

601
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,640
gave me the medicine.

602
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,310
What is it? Is it sweet?

603
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,680
Can I taste it?

604
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,470
Don't simply consume medicine.

605
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,160
I've practiced with you for a long time.

606
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,350
My legs even got swollen.

607
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:25,880
Look.

608
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,470
Just one sip.

609
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:29,520
Okay.

610
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,040
It's sweet.

611
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,430
I wonder if my mood will get better

612
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,350
after taking something sweet.

613
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,070
You're not in a good mood?

614
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,000
Wang Sheng

615
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,190
told me over dinner

616
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:54,040
that they will elect the leader of Soul
Master Association tomorrow afternoon.

617
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:57,430
I registered as a candidate.

618
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:03,880
Tell me,

619
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,070
why is the leader elected by an election

620
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,280
and not by fighting?

621
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,230
You find it strange too, right?

622
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,070
Candidates have to prepare

623
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,400
a speech.

624
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,230
What should I talk about?

625
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,710
Actually the election

626
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,310
is not just about electing a leader.

627
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,950
It's about electing someone

628
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,310
who is willing to help others

629
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,470
and someone who is responsible.

630
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,350
As long as you are helpful,

631
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,680
I'm sure you will be elected.

632
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,800
I want to help others too.

633
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,760
Wang Sheng and I

634
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,070
will stand by you.

635
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,350
I'll buy you

636
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,400
a nice dress.

637
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,280
Okay.

638
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,880
Look at the ironsmith shop ahead.

639
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,350
The weapons they make are powerful.

640
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,160
I'm going to...

641
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,880
What is this?

642
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,350
It's sticky rice cake
with carrot filling.

643
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,400
I'll have one then.

644
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,430
How much is it?

645
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,920
Three copper soul coins for one.

646
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,230
You don't have money
but you want to eat.

647
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:11,800
Watch how I do it.

648
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,190
I'll be done soon.

649
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,280
Don't get too near.

650
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,190
Who taught you this?

651
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,000
My dad.

652
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:50,880
Uncle San.

653
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,070
Can you give me my wages

654
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,710
for this month

655
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,920
after deducting the cost of the iron?

656
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,680
I'll give you a pay rise.

657
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,000
Thank you, Uncle San.

658
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,350
We have money now. Let's go eat.

659
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,430
You're the best, Tang San.

660
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:08,070
Let's go.

661
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,310
You have it.

662
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,280
No.

663
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,350
You have it.

664
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,880
It's okay. You can have it.

665
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,470
Just eat it.

666
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,520
I will eat it, then.

667
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,590
Wu.

668
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,310
This is for you.

669
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,880
What is this?

670
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,070
It's a sleeve arrow.

671
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,710
I invented it and...

672
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,590
It's a secret weapon.

673
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,000
A secret weapon?

674
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,800
It's amazing, isn't it?

675
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,350
How do I use it?

676
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,000
It's simple. Let me show you.

677
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,400
Look.

678
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,520
Just push the button here

679
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,640
and the little arrow inside

680
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,950
will be shot.

681
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,400
I love this gadget.

682
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,800
Let me put it on you.

683
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:00,590
Okay.

684
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,040
Rest assured, Wu.

685
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,760
There's a safety device here.

686
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,190
It won't hurt you.

687
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:31,840
Wu.

688
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,320
Put your hand down.

689
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,000
What's the matter?

690
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,280
Remember,

691
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,600
don't use it

692
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,080
on people anyhow.

693
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,800
Don't worry.

694
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:41,910
I won't use it

695
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,040
unless it's necessary.

696
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,840
Move aside.

697
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,800
Get out of the way.

698
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:48,800
Move aside.

699
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,150
Get out of the way.

700
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,040
Get up.

701
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,950
Are you okay, Ma'am?

702
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,800
Are you okay, Ma'am?

703
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,150
My sticky rice cake.

704
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:00,800
Get up, Ma'am.

705
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,470
Get up.

706
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,150
Move aside.

707
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,520
Who are these people?

708
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,950
How could they leave
after they hit someone?

709
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,000
Have a seat, Ma'am.

710
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,670
My sticky rice cake.

711
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,280
Wu.

712
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,320
My stall is destroyed.

713
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,000
The governor of Nuoding City,

714
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,560
Xiao Chen Yu's father.

715
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,190
The governor?

716
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,710
A governor doesn't have
to apologize after hitting somebody?

717
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,230
He doesn't have to.

718
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,040
You told me that

719
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,360
the governor is more than just a salutation.

720
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,360
It's a status.

721
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,630
That's right.

722
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,840
What status is that?

723
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,760
He was born to be a governor.
It's hereditary.

724
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,560
But it's unfair.

725
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,230
One should achieve possession and power

726
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,560
with one's strength.

727
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:40,840
How could someone be born with it?

728
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,150
I don't quite understand, either.
