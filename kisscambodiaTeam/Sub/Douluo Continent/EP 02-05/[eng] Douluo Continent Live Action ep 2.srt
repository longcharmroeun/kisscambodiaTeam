<i>Episode 2</i>

15
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,760
Never let anyone see

16
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,720
the hammer in your left hand.

17
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,800
Never mention Xuan Tian Records

18
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,510
to anyone.

19
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,190
You have to walk on your own.

20
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:00,830
What happened?

21
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,630
I forgot the nails.

22
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,720
There's nothing to do with the nails.

23
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,440
The reason I taught you to do ironwork

24
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,120
is to let you learn Xuan Yu Hand.

25
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:12,910
I know.

26
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,830
I just can't bear to leave it
because I did that for a long time.

27
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,160
Just take it and go.

28
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,630
What else?

29
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,630
It's hard to give up the work
that has been done for a long time,

30
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,440
not to mention the people.

31
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,520
Dad, I'm a bit worried about you.

32
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,000
Why should you be worried?

33
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,520
Actually, my greatest worry is that

34
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,470
you'll be lonely

35
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,190
when I'm not here.

36
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,030
You won't tell me about

37
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,080
my mom,

38
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,390
but I know

39
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,030
you always miss her.

40
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,030
You drink every day

41
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,670
because you feel sad.

42
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,190
What nonsense are you talking about?

43
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,190
You can go. I won't drink anymore.

44
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,240
Dad,

45
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,830
what if I stay here?

46
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,520
Don't you want to be a Soul Master?

47
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,320
You can't endure the difficulties,

48
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,440
or do you think you are too foolish?

49
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,000
Since you've made up your mind,

50
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,800
don't give up easily.

51
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:27,880
Dad,

52
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,960
if I graduate from

53
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,440
the Soul Master School,

54
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,160
would you tell me

55
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,720
everything about the family?

56
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,520
It depends on your ability,

57
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,110
whether you can afford it all by then.

58
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,160
Then I must be

59
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,160
the strongest Soul Master.

60
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,960
Be careful.

61
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,750
You have to keep
Xuan Tian Records a secret,

62
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,670
but you can use your ability.

63
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,160
But my eyes will be purple.

64
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,880
What if someone else sees it?

65
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,520
The ability of a Soul Master is strange.

66
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,910
This is nothing.

67
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,160
Dad,

68
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,960
you know it well.

69
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,000
When you're practicing Martial Soul,

70
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,030
don't forget to perform
Xuan Tian Strike at the same time.

71
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,750
I got it.

72
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,190
You can go.

73
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,670
If you miss me,

74
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,350
tell Village Head
to ask me to return.

75
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,480
Okay.

76
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,320
I have to go.

77
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,480
Village Head, we can go now.

78
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,510
Let's go.

79
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,760
Here we are.

80
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,670
Don't stare at the headmaster.

81
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,600
It is impolite.

82
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,270
He's the headmaster?

83
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,760
Look at the passers-by.

84
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,920
Who dares to lie down at the entrance?

85
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,790
If he's not the headmaster,

86
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,600
at least he's the person
in charge of the school.

87
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,200
Coming for school admission?

88
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,830
My name is Tang San,
from Saint of Soul Village.

89
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,160
He is our village head.

90
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,160
This year...

91
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,640
Stop.

92
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,440
Come over here.

93
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,040
Go.

94
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,950
Show me your Martial Soul.

95
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,480
You can go in.

96
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,640
Are you the headmaster or...

97
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,110
What are you doing here?

98
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,600
Who are you? Who said you can come here?

99
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,070
It says "Soul Master School"
at the entrance,

100
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,110
don't you see that?

101
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,640
This is not a place where

102
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,070
everyone can come in, understand?

103
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,200
Yes.

104
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,720
Please don't be mad.

105
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,480
Someone recommended us to come here,

106
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,640
so we're here for school admission.

107
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,320
Can you tell us

108
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
what do we have to do

109
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,040
for registration?

110
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,550
Coming for school admission?

111
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,390
Yes.

112
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,670
I'll help the Office of Administration
to check on you.

113
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,790
Show me your recommendation letters.

114
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,600
Recommendation letter...

115
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,720
We don't have a recommendation letter.

116
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,270
You don't have it?

117
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,600
Get out!

118
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,830
-You!
-No!

119
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,160
By the way, Tang San

120
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,230
has a recommendation badge
from Martial Soul Hall.

121
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:15,880
You can take a look.

122
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,480
This is the recommendation badge
of Martial Soul Hall.

123
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,070
Take it.

124
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:22,670
Hurry.

125
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,790
It allows you

126
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,640
to become an attached student
in the Beginner School in Nuoding City.

127
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,880
Your food, accommodation
and tuition fees are free.

128
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,880
Bring it with you
when you go to register.

129
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,720
He said that with
this recommendation badge,

130
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,390
Tang San can attend school for free.

131
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,040
The recommendation badge
of Martial Soul Hall?

132
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,760
-Yes.
-Yes.

133
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,350
Why would great people
from Martial Soul Hall

134
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,760
recommend this brat

135
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,320
and let him become an attached student?

136
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:42,480
I...

137
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,670
It's fake, isn't it?

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,600
What do you mean?

139
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,550
No, Tang San.

140
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,760
It's true. He is recommended
by Officer Su Yun Tao,

141
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,200
the officer of Martial Soul Hall.

142
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,480
Who are you?

143
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,200
I'm the village head of
Saint of Soul Village.

144
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,720
I'm sending Tang San here.

145
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,040
Do you have a recommendation badge too?

146
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,550
No, I don't have it.

147
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,440
You don't have it?

148
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,640
Get out!

149
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,440
No.

150
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,830
No, Tang San.

151
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,000
I'll send you here.

152
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,440
You go in and settle down yourself,

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,600
okay?

154
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,070
What's with that look?

155
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,320
Are you feeling mad?

156
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,480
Are you feeling mad?

157
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,550
Don't stop him.

158
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,270
Are you feeling mad?

159
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,640
Stay out of trouble.
Go to school first.

160
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,440
No wonder.

161
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,350
No great man

162
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,880
will ever come from that hellhole.

163
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,000
You're just an uncultured swine.

164
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:24,720
What?

165
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,350
That's enough, Liu Long.

166
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:27,950
Young Master Xiao.

167
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,480
-He...
-I heard everything.

168
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,480
How can a student of Nuoding School

169
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,600
bully others

170
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,040
and humiliate an older person?

171
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,600
I...

172
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,200
Please don't be mad.

173
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,600
I apologize on his behalf.

174
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,670
It's okay.

175
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,030
You're a new student, right?

176
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,320
My family name is Xiao.

177
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,150
My name is Tang San.

178
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,280
Take your hand off.

179
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,520
Do you know who Young Master Xiao is?

180
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,550
He is the son of
the governor of Nuoding City.

181
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,470
You're just an uncultured swine.

182
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,640
Do you think you can
shake hands with Young Master Xiao?

183
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,150
Liu Long!

184
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:01,760
Welcome.

185
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,080
He always speaks abruptly.
Don't mind him.

186
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,670
We're all students here.
Let's get along well.

187
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,230
Okay.

188
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,230
By the way,

189
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,590
I run the Student Martial Club.

190
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,350
It aims to help all new students.

191
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,470
It's at the small plaza over there.

192
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,960
If you're interested,

193
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,400
you can fill in an application
to join the club.

194
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,790
All of us will learn together in the future,

195
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
so we should help each other.

196
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:23,960
Go.

197
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,200
I'll go and take a look
when I'm free later.

198
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,200
Okay.

199
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,640
Welcome to Nuoding School.

200
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,400
Please come inside.

201
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,350
You should go in. I'll go back now.

202
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,960
Alright. Be careful, Village Head.

203
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,230
I'll go back and visit you
during school holidays.

204
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,110
Alright, you should be careful too.

205
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,000
I'll get going.

206
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,790
Be careful.

207
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,880
Alright!

208
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,110
I forgot to ask you just now.

209
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,760
Since you are recommended by
Martial Soul Hall,

210
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,960
then your Martial Soul

211
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,880
must be something special.

212
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,640
I just showed

213
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,960
my Martial Soul to the teacher.

214
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,520
He is just a handyman of our school.

215
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,760
Young Master Xiao asked you a question.

216
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,710
What is your Martial Soul?

217
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:08,840
Blue Silver Plant.

218
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,030
Isn't that a useless Martial Soul?

219
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,030
Why would Martial Soul Hall

220
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,150
recommend such a useless person?

221
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,350
Liu Long.

222
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:19,960
How strong is your Soul Power?

223
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,790
I have full Soul Power.

224
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,440
You're born with full Soul Power?

225
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
That's a rare thing,

226
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,350
but your Martial Soul is...

227
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,320
Anyway,

228
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,520
I'd like to sincerely invite you

229
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,440
to join my Martial Club.

230
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,280
Thank you.

231
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,200
Useless.

232
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,760
Who hit me?

233
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,670
It's so weird.

234
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,960
Are you looking for me? What's up？

235
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,280
Show me your Martial Soul again.

236
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,710
Didn't you just see it?

237
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,840
I didn't see it clearly.

238
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,280
I mean, I didn't see it clearly,

239
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,230
it's not that I didn't see it at all.

240
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,150
I'm not blind.

241
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,960
I'm sorry. I misunderstood.

242
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,110
Are you really
born with full Soul Power?

243
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,470
It was confirmed by Officer Su Yun Tao,

244
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,110
the officer of Martial Soul Hall.

245
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:46,910
Then it should be right.

246
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,590
Show me the Martial Soul
in your left hand.

247
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,320
I don't know what you're talking about.

248
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,840
According to my research on 647 people

249
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,710
with Blue Silver Plant,

250
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,150
there are a total of
16 people with Soul Power,

251
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,030
and you're born with full Soul Power.

252
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,880
The size of an innate Soul Power
is proportional

253
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,520
to the quality of the Martial Soul.

254
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,280
If your Martial Soul
is Blue Silver Plant only,

255
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,400
you will never be able

256
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
to reach the state of full Soul Power.

257
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,760
So, I'm sure that

258
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,640
you should have another Martial Soul,

259
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,320
and this Martial Soul is very powerful.

260
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,110
There is an exception to every rule.

261
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,880
Perhaps I'm the exception.

262
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,110
There is an exception to every rule,

263
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,670
but there's no exception
for Blue Silver Plant.

264
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,030
According to my research on

265
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,960
Martial Soul for so many years,

266
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,550
I'm sure that

267
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,550
you should have another

268
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,590
very powerful Martial Soul

269
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,590
to provide you with Soul Power.

270
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,960
And you're the third person
who is one in a million

271
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,030
in the last hundred years
on the Douluo Continent

272
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,910
with Twin Martial Souls.

273
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,590
You look so surprised.

274
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,280
I don't quite understand
what you're saying,

275
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,440
but I think it's very powerful.

276
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,350
So,

277
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,910
let me see the Martial Soul
in your left hand.

278
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,760
I've told you that

279
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,470
I really don't have any
Twin Martial Souls.

280
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,080
Do you mean that

281
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,760
my theory is wrong?

282
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:56,880
I didn't say that.

283
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,840
My theory can't go wrong.

284
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,640
You're absolutely of Twin Martial Souls.

285
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,670
It's okay if you don't want to admit it.

286
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,470
It's up to you.

287
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,790
Why are you still wasting time here?

288
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,080
The Office of Administration is
short of helpers. Go carry the books.

289
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,350
I'll go now.

290
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,030
Are you a new student?

291
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,320
I'm an attached student.

292
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,230
All attached students
live in Dorm Seven.

293
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,000
Don't listen to his crap.
He's wasting your time.

294
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,520
You're not a teacher.

295
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,910
I'm not a teacher,

296
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,590
I'm just a guest

297
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,000
who gets free meals here.

298
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
You can call me Master

299
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,230
as they do.

300
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:26,880
Okay.

301
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,350
Master, if there's nothing else,
I'll leave now.

302
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,000
Follow me.

303
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,520
I'll bring you to the registration.

304
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,280
Students usually attend
classes in the morning,

305
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,640
and they're free to do anything
in the afternoon and evening.

306
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,840
Private fighting is
prohibited in the school,

307
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,320
but all students

308
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,400
are allowed to compete
at the training ground.

309
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,670
Therefore, most of the students

310
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,400
will book a slot at
the training ground after class

311
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,550
to practice their skills
among others.

312
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,710
Of course,

313
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,790
you can come and learn from me.

314
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,520
Blue Silver Plant is
not a useless Martial Soul.

315
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,960
In this school,

316
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,320
I'm the only one who can guide you.

317
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,400
You're really a smart kid.

318
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,150
There are three reasons
why you don't answer me.

319
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,200
Firstly,

320
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,080
you're not in a hurry to reject me

321
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,150
so that you won't offend me.

322
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,230
Secondly,

323
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,910
you're thinking about one question.

324
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,320
Since we've just met,

325
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,030
why should you become my student?

326
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,080
Thirdly,

327
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,670
you don't believe that I'm the only one

328
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,840
who can guide you in this school.

329
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,230
That's not what I'm thinking.

330
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,590
That is Xiao Chen Yu's
Student Martial Club.

331
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,280
What are they doing?

332
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,350
The first step to join
Student Martial Club is

333
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,470
to kill these rabbits.

334
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,030
Why?

335
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,080
If a Soul Master wants
to upgrade his Soul Ring,

336
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,080
he must hunt and kill Soul Beasts.

337
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,910
Xiao Chen Yu is trying

338
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,470
to make new students get used to

339
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,350
killing brutally from the beginning,

340
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,150
so they would
become a Soul Master later.

341
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,400
Are these Soul Beasts?

342
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,470
No.

343
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,030
They're just ordinary rabbits.

344
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,910
They're using their lives

345
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,520
to toughen up their hearts.

346
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:20,400
<i>Nuoding School</i>
Nuoding's Soul Master Begin...

347
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,080
Nuoding...

348
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,280
Not bad.

349
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,910
Should I stop her for you?

350
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,640
Where is the "Beginner"?

351
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,080
Is this Nuoding's
Beginner Soul Master School?

352
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,760
Yes.

353
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,230
Then why is there

354
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,030
only "Nuoding School" written on it?

355
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,110
I don't see the word "Beginner".

356
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,350
They omitted it.

357
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,670
Omitted?

358
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,080
Why?

359
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,440
How do I know?

360
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,840
Never mind, as long as
the address is correct.

361
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,400
Thank you.

362
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:55,880
Stop!

363
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,520
This is Nuoding's Soul Master School.

364
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,590
It's not a place where

365
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,880
any girls can come in easily.

366
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,230
Don't be rude.

367
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,200
As a student of the school,

368
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,910
how could you be so rude?

369
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,470
Yes.

370
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,110
Are you a new student?

371
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,350
My family name is Xiao.

372
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,150
My father is the governor of Nuoding City.

373
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,470
What is your...

374
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,550
Name, Miss?

375
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,470
What are you doing?

376
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,400
I'm going for registration.

377
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,110
Who said you can come in?

378
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:30,960
Why can't I come in?

379
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,440
I...

380
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,590
Young Master Xiao! Brother Liu!

381
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,230
Someone is making trouble
at the recruitment drive

382
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,320
and he released all the rabbits.

383
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,000
Who dares to do something like that?

384
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,550
He's right over there.

385
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,110
Doesn't he know that this is
Young Master Xiao's Martial Club?

386
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,280
Rabbits?

387
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,550
What is he doing?

388
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,280
I don't know.

389
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,150
What is he doing?

390
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,230
What's going on?

391
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,640
This is the kid who's making trouble.

392
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:02,960
It's you, you swine.

393
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,280
What do you want to do?

394
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,960
Brother Tang San,

395
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,840
is there any misunderstanding?

396
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,640
You are slaughtering them.

397
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,310
Slaughter?

398
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,950
Have you ever eaten meat?

399
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:16,470
Yes.

400
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,680
If you can eat meat,

401
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,040
then why can't we kill these rabbits?

402
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,190
Wolves and humans eat meat
for the same reason.

403
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,350
It's a source of food.

404
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,830
If it is to survive,

405
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,160
then there's no problem.

406
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,280
But if you kill for no reason,

407
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,880
it's nothing but abuse.

408
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,350
How do you face Soul Beasts

409
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,400
if you're not used to killing?

410
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,230
Even if we have to face Soul Beasts,

411
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,640
you shouldn't kill all of them

412
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,710
to solve the problem.

413
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,070
Moreover,

414
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,800
a strong person
should never be cold-blooded.

415
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,800
If you don't kill Soul Beasts,

416
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,230
how can you become a Soul Master?

417
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,520
There are good and bad Soul Beasts.

418
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,040
We can just kill the bad Soul Beasts.

419
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,710
There are good and bad Soul Beasts?

420
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,950
If you encounter a Soul Beast

421
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,760
which is suitable for
your Martial Soul in future,

422
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,190
will you choose to let it go?

423
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,280
As long as it doesn't hurt humans,

424
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,560
I won't kill it.

425
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,310
How can such a useless person
become a Soul Master?

426
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,110
Only a coward

427
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,760
would attack the weak.

428
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,160
What did you say?

429
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,470
Brother Tang,

430
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,920
killing these small animals

431
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,830
is the first step
to join my Martial Club.

432
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,230
Are you going to give up?

433
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,160
If that's the case,

434
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,640
I won't join the club.

435
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,310
Okay.

436
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,710
I won't blame you
if you don't want to join the club.

437
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:39,710
How about this?

438
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,350
If you catch all these rabbits back,

439
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,830
I'll let this matter drop.

440
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,710
He has to help us get them back.

441
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,680
It looks like he has a bad temper.

442
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,310
Yes.

443
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,110
Tang San,

444
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,560
I've given you a chance.

445
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,880
You better think about it.

446
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,590
The strong

447
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,590
is born to protect the weak.

448
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,280
Are you teaching me a lesson now?

449
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,070
I'm just telling you

450
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,640
a basic principle.

451
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,160
Do you still want to register?

452
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,470
I'll be right there!

453
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,590
Twin Martial Souls.

454
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,040
You're a genius.

455
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,640
No, that man is talking nonsense.

456
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,190
That man looks like

457
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,040
he doesn't know anything.

458
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,160
Yes, that's what I'm thinking too.

459
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,310
I came a few days earlier than you,

460
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,800
so

461
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,230
I know everything about the school.

462
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,280
My name is Wang Sheng.

463
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,230
My Martial Soul is a Combat Tiger.

464
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,830
My name is Tang San. I'm from Saint of Soul Village.

465
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,070
What is your Martial Soul?

466
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,520
Blue Silver Plant.

467
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:03,830
Blue Silver Plant?

468
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,280
A useless Martial Soul
can also enter the school now.

469
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,880
Brat, let me tell you something.

470
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,800
I'm the boss of this dorm.

471
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,160
From now on, you have to listen to me.

472
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,160
Do you understand?

473
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,350
Okay.

474
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,400
You...

475
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:26,680
You lied to me.

476
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,800
You are recommended by
Martial Soul Hall.

477
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,070
So,

478
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,070
your Martial Soul

479
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,230
can't be Blue Silver Plant.

480
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,680
I know I look rough,

481
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,920
but I'm actually an attentive person.

482
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,520
I know you're lying.

483
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,110
It's really Blue Silver Plant.

484
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,710
I thought...

485
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,590
No.

486
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,640
Then why did Martial Soul Hall
recommend you to come?

487
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,280
Perhaps they think I'm cute.

488
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,880
You... You're fooling me!

489
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,110
Come here.

490
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,880
Let's fight.

491
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,640
Show me what ability you have.

492
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,230
I won't fight with you.
I'll admit defeat.

493
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:21,920
Dorm Seven?

494
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,400
Thanks.

495
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,400
It's you!

496
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,680
Do we know each other?

497
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,520
Where do you live?

498
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,160
Right here.

499
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,110
Let's live here together.

500
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,680
What do you mean?

501
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,430
Has anyone taken this bed?

502
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,470
I don't know.

503
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,110
Then I'll rest here to stay warm.

504
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,400
How can you stay here?

505
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,190
This bed is not taken.

506
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,800
Are you kidding?

507
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,350
Who are you?

508
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,400
My name is Wang Sheng,

509
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,560
I'm the boss of Dorm Seven.

510
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,800
Young lady, are you a new student?

511
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,230
Stop fooling around.

512
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,710
Go back to your dorm now.

513
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:02,920
Let's fight.

514
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:05,710
What?

515
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,110
If you don't let me stay here,

516
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,280
then let's fight and make a decision.

517
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,560
You and me?

518
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,070
Is there something wrong with his brain?

519
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,950
He doesn't understand what I'm saying.

520
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,310
I'm new too.

521
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,310
I don't know either.

522
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,400
You're so skinny.

523
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,400
I might hurt you later.

524
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,430
Do you want to admit defeat?

525
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,400
Why would I admit defeat?

526
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,350
Are you afraid of me?

527
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,710
Since you want to practice,

528
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,040
then let's do it.

529
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,040
Again.

530
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,070
Am I the boss now?

531
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:03,710
No!

532
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,280
Why not?

533
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,880
We are all Soul Masters.

534
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,230
We have to fight
by using our Martial Soul.

535
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,520
So your Martial Soul is a tiger.

536
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,710
What's yours?

537
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,590
My Martial Soul is a rabbit.

538
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,520
But

539
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,230
I don't need to use
my Martial Soul to fight with you.

540
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,520
You're insulting me.

541
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,470
No, I'm telling the truth.

542
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,430
If you don't believe me, give it a try.

543
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,070
Then you have to be careful.

544
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,680
Thank you.

545
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,230
Tang San.

546
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:53,640
Master.

547
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:58,680
This is the new quilt that

548
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,000
the school gives to
those attached students.

549
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,070
I took it for you.

550
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,350
Thank you, Master.

551
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,830
Private fighting is
prohibited in the school.

552
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,000
Don't get yourself involved in a fight.

553
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:07,830
I...

554
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,520
Can you beat me without
using your Martial Soul?

555
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,830
Didn't you use your
Martial Soul just now?

556
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,190
I didn't use it.

557
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,110
Then how did you catch him?

558
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,520
I caught him just like that.

559
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:25,830
Let's fight.

560
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,000
No, I don't fight.

561
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,590
The winner will be the boss.

562
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,640
I don't want to be the boss.

563
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,430
Let's fight.

564
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,760
No matter what you say,

565
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,350
I'll never fight with you.

566
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,400
Let's fight.

567
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,400
I'm telling you,
I'll just fight for once.

568
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,110
Okay.

569
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:50,760
By the way,

570
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,310
my name is Wu. It means dancing.

571
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:53,760
My name is Tang San.

572
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:54,950
I know.

573
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,400
How do you know that?

574
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,160
You...

575
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,800
Stand back.

576
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,680
If not, I might hit you later.

577
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,760
The people at the back, get up here.

578
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,070
Come and watch the fight.

579
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,590
By the way,

580
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,520
my Martial Soul is a rabbit.
What about yours?

581
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,640
Blue Silver Plant.

582
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,680
What a coincidence!

583
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,350
What?

584
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:15,430
Isn't that what rabbits eat?

585
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:16,950
You're right.

586
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,070
Then you're my natural enemy.

587
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,760
I admit defeat
and I don't fight, is it okay?

588
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,760
No!

589
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,640
You don't need to
use Martial Soul to fight.

590
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,430
Alright, let's get started.

591
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,070
You have to be careful.

592
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,560
I admit defeat!

593
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,680
It seems like you didn't
use your full power.

594
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,430
No!

595
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,880
I did everything I could.

596
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,160
Really?

597
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:00,830
Yes...

598
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,920
Can you let me stand up first?

599
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,040
Who else wants to fight?

600
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,430
No...

601
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,310
You?

602
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,310
No...

603
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,280
You?

604
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,880
Then I'll be your leader.

605
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,230
Boss...

606
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,040
Hold on!

607
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,350
Don't call me Boss.

608
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,190
It sounds like I'm old.

609
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,680
Call me Sister Wu from now on.

610
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,280
Sister Wu!

611
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,760
If I'm going to take that bed,

612
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,800
no one will object, right?

613
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,640
Aren't you going back to your dorm?

614
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,680
This is my dorm.

615
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,070
What are you doing here?

616
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,190
Sir.

617
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,920
You're really here.

618
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,560
I'm okay. I've found Dorm Seven.

619
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:48,800
Where's your luggage?

620
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:49,920
I don't have it.

621
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,710
You didn't bring anything?
Didn't you bring your quilt either?

622
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:52,680
No.

623
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,230
It's okay. I can share it with him.

624
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,520
There has been a mistake
in the dorm arrangement.

625
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,470
Come with me.

626
00:26:59,190 --> 00:26:59,830
Where are we going?

627
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,040
To the girls' dorm.

628
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:01,880
I've just finished fighting

629
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,920
and become the boss here.

630
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,040
Why is this girl

631
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,950
so senseless?

632
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:10,710
Let's go.

633
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,430
In the girls' dorm,

634
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,800
do we have to fight to choose the boss?

635
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,040
Fight?

636
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,430
Don't listen to those bastards.

637
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,520
Let's go.

638
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,710
It scared me to death.

639
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,800
I thought the girl
was going to stay here.

640
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,430
Since Sister Wu has left,

641
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,710
then we have no boss for Dorm Seven.

642
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,830
The final fight,

643
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,710
the ultimate battle of the dorm's leader

644
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,470
is between you and me.

645
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,640
I'm here to study,

646
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,190
not to fight.

647
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,760
That's the rule.

648
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,640
Choose a boss.

649
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,280
Do you really want to
become a boss so much?

650
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,110
That's because the rich boys

651
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,400
always bully us.

652
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,400
Poor students like us must unite.

653
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,800
And as the boss of the dorm,

654
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,040
he must stand up for the others.

655
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,560
Let's fight and choose a boss.

656
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,350
If you stay,

657
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,640
you'll become one of us.

658
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,040
If you leave,

659
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,400
then you'll become our enemy.

660
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,470
Make your choice.

661
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,310
Young Master Xiao!

662
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,430
The fat is in the fire, Young Master.

663
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,070
I heard that they are
fighting at Dorm Seven.

664
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,040
Tang San, the boy
with Blue Silver Plant,

665
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,040
is injured.

666
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,350
Tang San.

667
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,280
Master.

668
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:37,830
Are you injured?

669
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,590
My nose was bleeding but it's okay now.

670
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,280
What happened?

671
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,520
The lamp suddenly fell,

672
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,470
and I pushed them away.

673
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,680
Then the lamp hit me.

674
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,520
Come on.

675
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:02,830
This...

676
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,430
Are you okay?

677
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,310
-Are you alright?
-How do you feel?

678
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,470
Brother San!

679
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,760
Are you okay? Be careful.

680
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,520
Let's go. Take him to the clinic.

681
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,520
I'm fine.

682
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,430
-Why do you have to take me there?
-You're bleeding.

683
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:12,880
Let's go.

684
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,000
Hurry up, let's go to the clinic.

685
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,040
Is that all?

686
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,470
That's all.

687
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,760
Is that how they accepted you

688
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,160
as the boss of Dorm Seven?

689
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,680
I don't want to become the boss.

690
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,950
Wang Sheng and the others told me that

691
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,470
if the brothers are being bullied,

692
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,640
I have to stand up for everyone.

693
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,430
I'm also responsible for the cleaning,

694
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:32,190
waking them up in the morning
and getting the food and drinks

695
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,160
for them.

696
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,430
It sounds like
you're the leader of the dorm.

697
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,760
They deceived you.

698
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,110
Hello, Uncle.

699
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,350
I would like to ask

700
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,520
if you still recruit apprentices here?

701
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,590
My father

702
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,160
is a blacksmith in the village.

703
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,590
I've been learning ironwork
from him since I was a kid.

704
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,470
My name is Tang San,

705
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,760
a student of Nuoding School.

706
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,640
I'm Shi San.

707
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,310
From now on, you can call me Uncle San.

708
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:04,830
Okay.

709
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,880
Hi, Uncle San.

710
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,470
You're skinny.

711
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,110
I don't think you can even
hold the casting hammer.

712
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,160
Where do you come from?

713
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,160
Saint of Soul Village.

714
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,280
What has your father taught you?

715
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,310
Casting, of course.

716
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,560
People have three hearts.

717
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,520
Over

718
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,880
here and here.

719
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,400
The muscles on a person's two calves

720
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,310
are very important.

721
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,800
They're like a second and a third heart.

722
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,280
If you want to use

723
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,040
your full power,

724
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,950
you must run
three hearts at the same time.

725
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,070
From the two calves,

726
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,310
the power is delivered to the thighs.

727
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,520
It passes through the back and arms,

728
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,830
and then it will be released.

729
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,190
Look and learn.

730
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,430
Xuan Yu Hand.

731
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,680
Is this the legendary

732
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,760
Random Air Hammer Skill?

733
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,950
Uncle San, I'm not sure if

734
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,800
this is Random Air Hammer Skill.

735
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,110
But this is what my father taught me.

736
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:35,830
It looks like

737
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,880
I've found a treasure.

738
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,310
How about this?

739
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,280
This is your payment
for making the dagger.

740
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,280
Thank you, Uncle San.

741
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:46,640
Uncle San,

742
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,920
can you give me some more iron nails?

743
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,160
Our boss is amazing.

744
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,710
It's done.

745
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,680
You are indeed capable.

746
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,000
It's not a big deal.

747
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,160
As the boss,

748
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,950
I should do something for everyone.

749
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,310
Boss,

750
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:05,880
have some water.

751
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,110
Thanks.

752
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,560
Why is it you?

753
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,640
They're all asleep. Don't wake them up.

754
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,680
I thought you went to
the girls' dorm, didn't you?

755
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:42,950
Forget it.

756
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,830
If you like this quilt,

757
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,160
I'll give it to you.

758
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:52,920
Come.

759
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,190
You're so warm,

760
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,190
just like Er Ming.

761
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,110
Who is Er Ming?

762
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,040
A monkey.

763
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,710
Monkey?

764
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:14,230
Your heart is beating
so fast. It's very noisy.

765
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,310
This can't be real.

766
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,110
I'm dreaming.

767
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,950
I must be dreaming.

768
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,160
Everything will be normal
when I wake up.

769
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,400
What are you guys looking at?

770
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,070
Good morning!

771
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,310
Morning!

772
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,160
Let's go.

773
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,310
Go!

774
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,710
What are you looking at?
You should leave now!

775
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,590
Do you know how to braid hair?

776
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,040
Brother San!

777
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,520
Help me braid my hair.

778
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:17,320
Okay.

779
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,950
How do you know
how to braid girls' hair?

780
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,230
When I was in Saint of Soul Village,

781
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,910
I would take care of

782
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,150
little children at home
while the adults went to work.

783
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,800
I know how to braid hair, tell stories

784
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,710
and many more.

785
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,390
Then the adults would

786
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,670
bring some wine for me.

787
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,080
Do you drink wine?

788
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,470
It's for my dad.

789
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,040
What about your mom?

790
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,950
I've never seen her before.

791
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:03,910
Why?

792
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,080
She died when I was born.

793
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,430
How did she die?

794
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,520
I don't know either.

795
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,430
My dad has never told me about her.

796
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,000
Are you sad?

797
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,470
Actually,

798
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,560
I've never seen her since I was a kid.

799
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,000
I don't know whether I'm sad,

800
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,870
but I think my dad must be very sad.

801
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,670
Otherwise, he wouldn't drink every day.
