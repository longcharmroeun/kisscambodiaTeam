<i>Episode 8</i>

15
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,900
I'm not from Shi Lan Ke.

16
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,260
I'm just an inn staff.

17
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:53,940
I...

18
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,500
To put it simply,

19
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,050
Shi Lan Ke School and I have a history.

20
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,010
Rose Inn helps Shi Lan Ke

21
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,540
organize the admission exam,

22
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,900
which means it's just as guilty.

23
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,770
I have nothing to do with it.

24
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,410
Whoever joins Shi Lan Ke

25
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,330
will be my enemy.

26
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,450
Should we save him?

27
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,860
Is this part of the exam?

28
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:19,980
You think so?

29
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,170
I know

30
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,100
some might think

31
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,970
this is the admission exam.

32
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,410
Tell me now.

33
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,970
How can I let them know

34
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:29,740
that I'm serious?

35
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:30,970
I...

36
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,660
I don't know.

37
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,500
I'll kill you

38
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,330
to prove it.

39
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,660
Come here.

40
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,300
This is your last moment.

41
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,460
At least look dignified.

42
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,890
I'm not one of them.

43
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,410
I have nothing to do with them.

44
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,820
It doesn't look like an exam.

45
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,410
Shi Lan Ke picked this inn.

46
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,300
You only have your bad luck to blame.

47
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,300
Quadruple Soul Rings. Soul Sect.

48
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:17,500
My vine

49
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,690
can't reach him.

50
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,610
I'll finish my business,

51
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,410
then I'll entertain you two.

52
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:32,970
Let him go.

53
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,250
Supreme Palm.

54
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,580
Nether Spikes.

55
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:22,820
Ou Si Ke!

56
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,700
See it now?

57
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:34,980
This is what happened

58
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,290
when you want to join Shi Lan Ke.

59
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,290
Shi Lan Ke

60
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,850
won't come and protect you.

61
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,290
If you stay,

62
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,820
you'll be my enemy.

63
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,500
Can I quit?

64
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,850
Those who want to quit,

65
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,050
do it now.

66
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,730
Why did you kill him?

67
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,610
He's just a staff.

68
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,610
He's not related to the school.

69
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,220
Bad timing then.

70
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,940
His fate has been decided.

71
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,260
Killing people
doesn't make you stronger.

72
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,140
It only shows that you can't control

73
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:17,890
yourself.

74
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,660
Audacious kid.

75
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,170
Everyone can leave

76
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,140
but you have to stay.

77
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,260
Are kids nowadays this reckless?

78
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,450
Wu.

79
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,820
Speed can increase power.

80
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,260
First Soul skill.

81
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,260
Acala's Statue.

82
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,140
Wu!

83
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:16,820
Wu.

84
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,730
Sorry, brother.

85
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,980
I made you worry.

86
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,540
It's my fault.

87
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,980
I couldn't protect you.

88
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,450
I'm sorry.

89
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:29,980
I'm sorry.

90
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,460
If forbearance means I'll lose someone,

91
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,700
then even if

92
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,290
I'll die,

93
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,290
I will avenge my sister.

94
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,730
Without using Martial Soul?

95
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,850
What technique did you use?

96
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,460
Again.

97
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,050
This is Gravity Squeeze.

98
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,610
You'd better stay put.

99
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:55,940
Seven Soul Rings!

100
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,340
He's a Soul Saint.

101
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:17,650
Brother.

102
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,460
Tang San.

103
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,700
Who are you?

104
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,780
Tang San.

105
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,500
Tang San.

106
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,940
Are you okay, Wu?

107
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,210
No need to continue.

108
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,410
You guys passed.

109
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,020
What do you mean?

110
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,340
This is a test

111
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,610
from Shi Lan Ke.

112
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,970
It tests your ability

113
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,580
and your bravery.

114
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,650
You little freaks all passed.

115
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,340
You kill someone just for a test.

116
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,580
Hey, time's up.

117
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,340
Did you really think that I was dead?

118
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,850
How was my acting?

119
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:24,380
Come.

120
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,780
Weren't you...

121
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,410
Let me introduce myself again.

122
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,380
I'm Ou Si Ke from

123
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,050
Shi Lan Ke.

124
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,500
Remember me, Ou Si Ke.

125
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,780
How was my acting?

126
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,090
Tell me.

127
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:37,850
It's almost

128
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,170
real.

129
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,650
You know why?

130
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,730
I studied my character

131
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,730
diligently.

132
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,410
I even gave myself

133
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,410
the role of inn staff.

134
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,940
I came up with his back story,

135
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,730
his manner of speech,

136
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,580
his behaviour,

137
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,700
and the details of his murder.

138
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,340
I pondered over them.

139
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,170
Look.

140
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:58,780
When I die,

141
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,210
every detail has to be on point.

142
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:00,820
The detail

143
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,140
is what makes it so real.

144
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,170
Understood?

145
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,700
I don't get it.

146
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,650
It's fine.

147
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:07,940
When school starts,

148
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,140
we can discuss

149
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,050
about arts.

150
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,610
I'm very...

151
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,290
Ou Si Ke,

152
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,020
stop rambling.

153
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,900
When you were fighting
against Mr. Zhao,

154
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,290
you used two skills.

155
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:19,530
But they weren't Soul Skills.

156
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,050
What then?

157
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,700
They weren't Soul Skills indeed.

158
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,170
Just some tricks up my sleeve.

159
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:27,970
Shi Lan Ke

160
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,700
doesn't like dirty tricks.

161
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,580
It's not dirty tricks.

162
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:32,900
A Martial Soul Battle

163
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,050
without Soul Skill.

164
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,340
Isn't this cheating?

165
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,500
Tang San only has two Soul Rings.

166
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,940
To fight someone with seven Soul Rings,

167
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,020
we needed other strategies.

168
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,410
Martial Soul Battle has to be fair.

169
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,580
He was cheating.

170
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,530
Dai Mu Bai.

171
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,260
The rules say that

172
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,730
if they can defeat me,

173
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,460
they pass the exam.

174
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,340
Tang San did it.

175
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,050
We can't

176
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,210
reject someone just because

177
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,530
we haven't seen his techniques before.

178
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:00,260
Don't you think?

179
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:01,900
So,

180
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,260
everyone here now

181
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,780
has passed the exam.

182
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:07,940
Besides,

183
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,900
the potential

184
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,900
and will power you showed

185
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,650
are freakish.

186
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,580
Excellent.

187
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:15,780
Dai Mu Bai.

188
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,610
Tell Headmaster that

189
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,460
I'm leaving.

190
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:20,340
Wait.

191
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,650
Let me introduce to you all.

192
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,580
Mr. Zhao Wu Ji,

193
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,090
one of our earliest

194
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,260
graduates.

195
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:27,730
He also used to

196
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,050
teach here.

197
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,020
Used to?

198
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,140
Due to the lack of funds,

199
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,900
we can't hire teachers anymore.

200
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,460
But Mr. Zhao

201
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:41,020
still helps us with the admission exam.

202
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,170
Maybe it's because I look like a villain.

203
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,580
No, not at all.

204
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,050
You have potential.

205
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,500
Work hard.

206
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,700
Shi Lan Ke won't let you down.

207
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,210
Goodbye, sir.

208
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:01,970
Goodbye, sir.

209
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,090
All right. Rest well.

210
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,780
I'll show you the school tomorrow.

211
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:10,650
Let's go.

212
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,580
I'm not here for enrollment.

213
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,900
I'm here for you, Dai Mu Bai.

214
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,170
Are you afraid of a duel?

215
00:15:26,194 --> 00:15:36,194

♔ Follow @skysoultan on Instagram ♔

216
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,410
Stop.

217
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,170
You can't win.

218
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,700
Purple? Millennium Soul Ring.

219
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,700
Triple Soul Rings. Soul Honour?

220
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,380
I killed a Millennium Supreme Tiger

221
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,820
and obtained the third Soul Ring.

222
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,210
White Tiger Vajra Transformation

223
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,020
will boost my combat power

224
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,050
and defense greatly.

225
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,700
Speed too.

226
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,610
I won't give up.

227
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,500
I will defeat you.

228
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:29,900
Boring.

229
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,460
Miss, I have an idea.

230
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,170
You already paid up.

231
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,210
You passed the exam too.

232
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,650
Why not study here?

233
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,900
I'm not here for enrollment.

234
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,700
Look,

235
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,500
in school,

236
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,140
we are always together.

237
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,140
You can duel

238
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,090
Dai Mu Bai at any time.

239
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,380
Also, Dai Mu Bai is strong.

240
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,610
What does it mean?

241
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:49,650
What?

242
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,050
It means Shi Lan Ke School

243
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:51,970
is good.

244
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,260
When you study here,

245
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,700
you'll defeat him in no time.

246
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:57,650
That's true.

247
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,290
In that case,

248
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,260
you'll

249
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,820
need to pay again.

250
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,610
But I already paid up.

251
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,410
You paid the registration fee
this afternoon.

252
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:07,940
You fought Dai Mu Bai

253
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,850
once.

254
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,090
And now, you need to

255
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:10,970
pay the tuition fee.

256
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,260
After you pay up,

257
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,290
the teacher

258
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,090
will train you.

259
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,530
You'll improve

260
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,210
and defeat him.

261
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,180
No?

262
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:22,900
Oh...

263
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,850
Rest well.

264
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,660
School tomorrow!

265
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:27,850
Hey.

266
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,500
How did you hurt Mr. Zhao?

267
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,730
When I saw you lose consciousness,

268
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,020
I lost control of myself.

269
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,300
Everything was out of reflex.

270
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,660
Not using Martial Soul?

271
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:58,850
But I might have

272
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:00,900
combined both Xuan Tian Strike

273
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,180
and the Martial Soul.

274
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,540
I didn't expect it to negate

275
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,660
the opponent's Martial Soul.

276
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,730
Xuan Tian Strike?

277
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,570
It's a technique from Xuan Tian Records.

278
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,730
It augments my breath.

279
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,930
Under Xuan Tian Strike's protection,

280
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,060
Mr. Zhao's damage against

281
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,180
my Martial Soul has decreased.

282
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,540
His palm

283
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,540
didn't hurt as much.

284
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,610
Try again, perhaps?

285
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,450
What?

286
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,180
Impossible.

287
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,020
Combining them

288
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,260
makes them repel each other.

289
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,660
Don't try again then.

290
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,090
How did it work that time then?

291
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,570
What exactly is Xuan Tian Strike?

292
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,300
How much loss
do we have to cover this time?

293
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:23,330
What's up?

294
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,380
You were just watching just now.

295
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,380
So?

296
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:30,930
It means

297
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,930
it doesn't count.

298
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,900
It's not about money.

299
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,090
You know that, right?

300
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,210
Doesn't the school need funding?

301
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,970
It's not the case.

302
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,780
Bring me to the school tomorrow.

303
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,450
I'll talk to the headmaster.

304
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,330
Headmaster.

305
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,260
The girl who wanted to duel Dai Mu Bai

306
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,660
paid again.

307
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,090
The more the merrier.

308
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:15,730
Of course.

309
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:17,810
This

310
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,850
is the money from the girl
who just watched.

311
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,090
She wanted to talk to you.

312
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,930
I feel like

313
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,850
she means trouble.

314
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,690
Careful. We're almost there.

315
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,970
This is Shi Lan Ke.

316
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,810
Miss,

317
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,610
why are you using this for laundry?

318
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,330
This is not an ordinary plank.

319
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,060
This is...

320
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,060
This...

321
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,140
Here.

322
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,610
Shi Lan Ke.

323
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,210
Is this the school?

324
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,020
Yes.

325
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,810
Are they students?

326
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,330
They are...

327
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:28,900
They are villagers.

328
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:35,540
She enrolled.

329
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,660
So we take anyone in now?

330
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,730
She passed the exam

331
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:40,850
and she paid twice.

332
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,090
No reason not to take her in.

333
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,140
Is this village the school?

334
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,180
No,

335
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,810
the school is in the village.

336
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,540
Where's the dorm?

337
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,450
We don't have that.

338
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:56,780
Careful.

339
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,610
Slow and steady.

340
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:58,330
Headmaster!

341
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,780
You're the headmaster? Headmaster?

342
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:03,500
Yes.

343
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,300
I'm the headmaster of Shi Lan Ke,

344
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:05,900
Lander.

345
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,570
On behalf of Shi Lan Ke's
students and staff,

346
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,060
welcome.

347
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:10,810
Students and staff?

348
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,610
Other than the freshers,

349
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,380
I only see 3 people.

350
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,570
Our Headmaster is very petty.

351
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:21,850
You're dead meat.

352
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,420
We're poor.

353
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,780
This is what we have.

354
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,540
We'll tell you more later.

355
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,690
Mu Bai.

356
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,570
See if something
needs to be repaired there.

357
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:31,450
Bring them over.

358
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:31,930
Sure.

359
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:32,850
Come with me.

360
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,300
Repair?

361
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:35,970
Come.

362
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:36,660
Repair what?

363
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:41,970
You stay here.

364
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,450
Dai!

365
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,330
The Hu girl

366
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,210
treats you differently.

367
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,140
You don't know her?

368
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,690
No.

369
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,090
Think harder.

370
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:51,730
Maybe you forgot.

371
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,330
Headmaster didn't want to take her in.

372
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,780
Then she asked for a private talk.

373
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,330
She said she could help the school.

374
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,180
What can a girl do

375
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,140
to help the school?

376
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,660
Does our school have a problem?

377
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:02,900
Our biggest problem

378
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,730
is nosy students.

379
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,180
This is directed towards me, isn't it?

380
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,450
So this Hu girl

381
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,210
is coming for me?

382
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,450
But why?

383
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:11,330
Also,

384
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,540
the way she looks at you

385
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,180
is different.

386
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,300
Perhaps she has met

387
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,090
with Headmaster before?

388
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,450
A private talk...

389
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:18,540
Maybe

390
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,450
she is Headmaster's

391
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,210
long-lost daughter?

392
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,570
She's back now.

393
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,500
This story is too intriguing.

394
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,420
Quality content, Dai.

395
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,570
Quality content.

396
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:30,570
In that case,

397
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,970
you should eavesdrop.

398
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,970
I probably should.

399
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,900
I'll see you then.

400
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,690
Ignore him. He's crazy.

401
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,540
I can't believe

402
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,420
the famous Devil's School

403
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,420
hides in a village.

404
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,570
It's not hiding.

405
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,570
The rent here is cheap.

406
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,020
That's because you want to stay neutral.

407
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,660
Hence there are restrictions everywhere.

408
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,020
You know a lot.

409
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:58,970
Shi Lan Ke School

410
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,900
might be the only neutral school

411
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,780
on Douluo Continent.

412
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,970
Without sponsorship,

413
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:04,900
you guys are poor.

414
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,060
We're poor

415
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,660
but we're free.

416
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:11,690
I heard

417
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,210
the governor of Suo Tuo City

418
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,690
wants to cancel your school license.

419
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,850
He'll act soon.

420
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,140
Surely you want to know

421
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,260
how I got this information.

422
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,660
I know who you are.

423
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,020
Come with me.

424
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:45,780
No.

425
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,540
Wait, yes.

426
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:51,330
But...

427
00:24:58,810 --> 00:24:59,690
Brother Ou.

428
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,660
We want to go back to town.

429
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:02,810
Can you be our guide?

430
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,780
Ou Si Ke will do.

431
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,020
We'll leave soon.

432
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,090
What are you looking at?

433
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,810
This Hu girl

434
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,260
went in with Headmaster.

435
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,540
You're stalking Headmaster?

436
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,060
Why are you bothered by it?

437
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,970
I'm just curious.

438
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,330
An artist draws inspiration

439
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,060
from his life.

440
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:28,690
Okay?

441
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,970
I need to stay

442
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,540
curious and excited.

443
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,300
A strong curiosity towards life

444
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,900
compels me to study

445
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:35,660
any

446
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,690
novelties that I encounter.

447
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:38,850
Look!

448
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,420
Over there.

449
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,610
Anything can happen

450
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,780
there.

451
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,610
My imagination can even

452
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,140
make a spectacle out of it.

453
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:50,900
When I write,

454
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:52,930
it will flow naturally.

455
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:57,020
Well, if it's purely fictional,

456
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,450
isn't that lying then?

457
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,210
It's all gibberish.

458
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:01,730
You don't understand.

459
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,570
People nowadays

460
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,730
don't want to believe

461
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,020
anything real.

462
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,300
They prefer

463
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,610
something dramatic.

464
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,690
This is the charm of art.

465
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:14,970
Got it?

466
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:20,970
I tell him...

467
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,140
Then...

468
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:25,970
When I'm composing,

469
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,610
I'm more of a lone wolf.

470
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,450
I'll tell you once I'm done.

471
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,140
What is he talking about?

472
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,690
Maybe he doesn't want to be disturbed.

473
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,060
Let's go somewhere.

474
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:43,780
We can wait.

475
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,140
Since you're waiting,

476
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,970
check this out.

477
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:49,420
Hurry up.

478
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,570
What is this?

479
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,540
My heart and soul.

480
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,210
Careful.

481
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,540
Don't come here, Headmaster.

482
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,330
Please.

483
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,060
This guy has been following you.

484
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,500
In fact, he's been protecting you.

485
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:08,970
Right?

486
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,090
What did you do to him?

487
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,180
Nothing.

488
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,450
He's just immobilized.

489
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,420
If I'm not mistaken,

490
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,660
he's an officer

491
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,690
from Martial Soul Hall. Like you, right?

492
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:20,570
Yes.

493
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:21,930
So?

494
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,180
Martial Soul Hall likes my school now?

495
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,330
Martial Soul Hall
has nothing to do with it.

496
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,850
It's a personal matter.

497
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,060
Someone from Martial Soul Hall

498
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,020
wants to join another school?

499
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,500
I remember you said

500
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,140
Shi Lan Ke welcomes everyone.

501
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:38,380
Except for Martial Soul Hall.

502
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,970
The governor of Suo Tuo City wants

503
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,060
to revoke your school license.

504
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,210
I can help.

505
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,090
Are you threatening me?

506
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,180
You're mistaken.

507
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,450
It's a favor.

508
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,570
In exchange for your enrollment?

509
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:52,850
I'll audit.

510
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,500
I won't be a student.

511
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:55,780
Don't worry.

512
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,060
Audit?

513
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:58,900
Yes.

514
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,780
I will also pay

515
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,140
for auditing.

516
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,210
I know

517
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,140
the school needs funding.

518
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:14,780
Martial Soul Hall

519
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,730
has the best resource on Douluo Continent.

520
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,930
Why do you wish to join Shi Lan Ke?

521
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,330
For Dai Mu Bai.

522
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,420
Dai Mu Bai?

523
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,900
Are you two related?

524
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,300
Not at all.

525
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,140
We might be in the future.

526
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,970
You're not allowed to recruit

527
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,020
for Martial Soul Hall.

528
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,260
I swear not to.

529
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,180
You'll only audit. No lectures for you.

530
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:44,850
Thanks, Headmaster.

531
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,570
He's not allowed to enter the school.

532
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,260
As you wish.

533
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:53,780
Don't worry.

534
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,180
The school is safe.

535
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:56,780
Headmaster will protect me.

536
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,500
I will stay in Suo Tuo City.

537
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,500
Find me if anything.

538
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,900
An officer takes orders from you.

539
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,020
Where does that guy come from?

540
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,210
It's him.

541
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,690
Do you know him?

542
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,060
He's Su Yun Tao,

543
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,780
an officer from Martial Soul Hall.

544
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:41,970
He helped me to

545
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,540
awaken my Martial Soul.

546
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,020
Martial Soul Hall?

547
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:46,690
This is complicated.

548
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:49,900
My play.

549
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:50,660
How is it?

550
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:51,930
Do you like it?

551
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:52,780
This...

552
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,300
Yes, this.

553
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,020
I wrote this.

554
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:55,730
My biggest dream

555
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:56,850
is to be

556
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,930
an actor in a circus,

557
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,810
performing the play I wrote.

558
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,180
I will bring art

559
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,330
to every corner of Douluo Continent.

560
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,140
When that day comes,

561
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,420
I'll die without regret.

562
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:10,450
Excuse me,

563
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:11,900
but one question.

564
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:13,450
You're a Soul Master, aren't you?

565
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:14,260
Yes.

566
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:15,260
But...

567
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,780
Having a Martial Soul

568
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,500
doesn't mean I have to be a Soul Master.

569
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,450
Don't you think

570
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,730
my dream serves a greater purpose?

571
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:22,810
Art!

572
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,330
My dream is to make art.

573
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:25,500
I'm sorry.

574
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,570
We're not good with arts.

575
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:28,780
It's fine.

576
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,930
Everyone is equal in front of art.

577
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:32,450
So,

578
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,730
how's my play?

579
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:37,450
It's not bad.

580
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:38,730
How so?

581
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,690
Just tell me honestly.

582
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,020
The play is good

583
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,850
but the villain inside is weird.

584
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,260
He has no motives.

585
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:51,260
You...

586
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,330
I made that up.

587
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,330
Spot on.

588
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,300
In this play,

589
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,450
the villain's motive and plot

590
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,540
are the weakest points.

591
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:02,060
You noticed straight away.

592
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,210
You're good, Tang San.

593
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,420
Are you professional?

594
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,210
No, I made it up.

595
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,780
Even more impressive!

596
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,570
Instinct is an artist's

597
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,210
greatest weapon.

598
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,180
Don't you know?

599
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,450
We should discuss

600
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,850
the villain's character.

601
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:16,450
How about it?

602
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,210
We want to go to the town, Ou.

603
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,970
I'll guide you two.

604
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:27,780
Let's discuss on the way.

605
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,020
Wu!

606
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,660
Do you like my play?

607
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,300
Yes, yes.

608
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,610
Did you notice the plot twist?

609
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,970
He thought he knew that.

610
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:38,900
Do you like it?

611
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,960
<i>Rose Inn</i>

612
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,090
Normally,

613
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,140
those who guide freshers

614
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,930
will wait here for announcements.

615
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,570
Why is the door locked then?

616
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,210
Lander founded Rose Inn.

617
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,780
It was meant to make a profit

618
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,380
and fund Shi Lan Ke school.

619
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,610
No one visited the inn,

620
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:04,900
so every year

621
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,610
it becomes the place for the admission exam.

622
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,610
It only opened once,
then it closed down.

623
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,930
Why is the school so poor?

624
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:12,660
Let me tell you.

625
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:15,300
In Suo Tuo City, the Seven Clans

626
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,540
and other parties

627
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,930
tried to fund us,

628
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,500
but we refused them.

629
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:20,690
Why?

630
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,500
Headmaster said:

631
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,300
"I don't want

632
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,690
Shi Lan Ke to be sponsored by anyone

633
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:31,540
because

634
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,420
the school

635
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,930
will then become a pawn.

636
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,180
I'm responsible for my students.

637
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:38,970
And

638
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:40,610
I don't want

639
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,380
my students

640
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,450
to take sides

641
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,260
and have their path set in stone

642
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,210
before they discover who they truly are.

643
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:51,090
This is plain irresponsible.

644
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:51,930
Do you understand?

645
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,060
It sounds dumb, right?

646
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:57,690
It's decent.

647
00:32:59,450 --> 00:32:59,930
I quite...

648
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,420
Pick your own path, right?

649
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:02,180
Of course.

650
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:03,540
I already know

651
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,380
where I want to go.

652
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,060
I will be an actor.

653
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,330
I will write plays.

654
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,660
I will create arts.

655
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,540
Did Headmaster encourage you

656
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:14,930
after knowing your decision?

657
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,540
He also said that

658
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,180
if I didn't change my dream,

659
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,970
he'd burn all my plays.

660
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:23,730
That reminds me that

661
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:24,930
I should stow away

662
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:25,850
my plays later.

663
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:26,730
Thank you.

664
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:30,730
Master!

665
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,060
We passed the exam.

666
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:36,730
What happened, sir?

667
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,330
After I ushered you two in yesterday,

668
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,260
someone from Martial Soul Hall

669
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,140
entered Rose Inn.

670
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:45,810
This is Rose Inn.

671
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,660
Let me show you what I wrote.

672
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:50,540
Are they here

673
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,730
for what happened in Nuoding?

674
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,780
No one came to us.

675
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,660
Only students were present yesterday.

676
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,210
Good then.

677
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,450
You're still wanted.

678
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,210
Be cautious.

679
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:02,090
Noted.

680
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,140
Hi.

681
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,090
Are you Tang San's teacher?

682
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:11,300
I'm from Shi Lan Ke,

683
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,610
Ou...

684
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,330
Ou Si Ke.

685
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:17,090
By the way,

686
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:18,780
amongst the students,

687
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,090
did you notice someone

688
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,020
with a bamboo hat?

689
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,410
bamboo hat?

690
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:24,410
Yes.

691
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,020
Oriental hat.

692
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,450
She's called

693
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:28,300
Hu Lie Na.

694
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:29,860
You know, this girl...

695
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,020
If she ever acts,

696
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,410
she's perfect

697
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:36,260
for a cunning and complex villain.

698
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,060
This reminds me of Headmaster.

699
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,130
Headmaster has always been single.

700
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:42,340
Based on my observations,

701
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:44,260
he has zero luck with girls.

702
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:45,540
But this time, he spent

703
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,340
a long time

704
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,540
talking to her in a room.

705
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:48,780
It's his own room.

706
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,580
There's a stranger inside too.

707
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,930
Something's fishy.

708
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,210
Please summarise everything in ten words.

709
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,820
She was then talking
to Headmaster privately in his room.

710
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:03,780
Ten words.

711
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,890
Ten words!

712
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:05,500
Right?

713
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,170
Exactly ten.

714
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:11,340
Master...

715
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,060
I feel like

716
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:17,260
the stories I want to tell

717
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,820
should be told succinctly,

718
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,860
with easy-to-understand words.

719
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,210
That's how it should be.

720
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,730
The audience will understand

721
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,500
my stories better.

722
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,730
Thanks, Master.

723
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,580
Thank you.

724
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,930
You gave me an epiphany.

725
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,410
Headmaster is what Hu Lie Na wants.

726
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,260
She might be from Martial Soul Hall too.

727
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,130
When did Shi Lan Ke

728
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,100
become associated

729
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,860
with Martial Soul Hall?

730
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,300
We're not related

731
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,210
to Martial Soul Hall at all.

732
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,860
Su Yun Tao was there too.

733
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,580
Was he who you wanted to meet?
