<i>Episode 8</i>

15
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,400
I'm not from Shi Lan Ke.

16
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,760
I'm just an inn staff.

17
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,440
I...

18
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,000
To put it simply,

19
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,550
Shi Lan Ke School and I have a history.

20
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,510
Rose Inn helps Shi Lan Ke

21
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,040
organize the admission exam,

22
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,400
which means it's just as guilty.

23
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,270
I have nothing to do with it.

24
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,910
Whoever joins Shi Lan Ke

25
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,830
will be my enemy.

26
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,950
Should we save him?

27
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,360
Is this part of the exam?

28
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,480
You think so?

29
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,670
I know

30
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,600
some might think

31
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,470
this is the admission exam.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,910
Tell me now.

33
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,470
How can I let them know

34
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,240
that I'm serious?

35
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,470
I...

36
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,160
I don't know.

37
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll kill you

38
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,830
to prove it.

39
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,160
Come here.

40
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,800
This is your last moment.

41
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,960
At least look dignified.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,390
I'm not one of them.

43
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,910
I have nothing to do with them.

44
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,320
It doesn't look like an exam.

45
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,910
Shi Lan Ke picked this inn.

46
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,800
You only have your bad luck to blame.

47
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,800
Quadruple Soul Rings. Soul Sect.

48
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,000
My vine

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,190
can't reach him.

50
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,110
I'll finish my business,

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,910
then I'll entertain you two.

52
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,470
Let him go.

53
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,750
Supreme Palm.

54
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,080
Nether Spikes.

55
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,320
Ou Si Ke!

56
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,200
See it now?

57
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,480
This is what happened

58
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,790
when you want to join Shi Lan Ke.

59
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,790
Shi Lan Ke

60
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,350
won't come and protect you.

61
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,790
If you stay,

62
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,320
you'll be my enemy.

63
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,000
Can I quit?

64
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,350
Those who want to quit,

65
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,550
do it now.

66
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,230
Why did you kill him?

67
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,110
He's just a staff.

68
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,110
He's not related to the school.

69
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,720
Bad timing then.

70
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,440
His fate has been decided.

71
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,760
Killing people
doesn't make you stronger.

72
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,640
It only shows that you can't control

73
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,390
yourself.

74
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,160
Audacious kid.

75
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,670
Everyone can leave

76
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,640
but you have to stay.

77
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,760
Are kids nowadays this reckless?

78
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:26,950
Wu.

79
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,320
Speed can increase power.

80
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,760
First Soul skill.

81
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,760
Acala's Statue.

82
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,640
Wu!

83
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,320
Wu.

84
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,230
Sorry, brother.

85
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
I made you worry.

86
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,040
It's my fault.

87
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,480
I couldn't protect you.

88
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,950
I'm sorry.

89
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,480
I'm sorry.

90
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,960
If forbearance means I'll lose someone,

91
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,200
then even if

92
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,790
I'll die,

93
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,790
I will avenge my sister.

94
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,230
Without using Martial Soul?

95
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,350
What technique did you use?

96
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,960
Again.

97
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,550
This is Gravity Squeeze.

98
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,110
You'd better stay put.

99
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,440
Seven Soul Rings!

100
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,840
He's a Soul Saint.

101
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,150
Brother.

102
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,960
Tang San.

103
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,200
Who are you?

104
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,280
Tang San.

105
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,000
Tang San.

106
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,440
Are you okay, Wu?

107
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,710
No need to continue.

108
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,910
You guys passed.

109
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,520
What do you mean?

110
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,840
This is a test

111
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,110
from Shi Lan Ke.

112
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,470
It tests your ability

113
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,080
and your bravery.

114
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,150
You little freaks all passed.

115
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,840
You kill someone just for a test.

116
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,080
Hey, time's up.

117
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,840
Did you really think that I was dead?

118
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,350
How was my acting?

119
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:24,880
Come.

120
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,280
Weren't you...

121
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:28,910
Let me introduce myself again.

122
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,880
I'm Ou Si Ke from

123
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,550
Shi Lan Ke.

124
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,000
Remember me, Ou Si Ke.

125
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,280
How was my acting?

126
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,590
Tell me.

127
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,350
It's almost

128
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,670
real.

129
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,150
You know why?

130
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,230
I studied my character

131
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,230
diligently.

132
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,910
I even gave myself

133
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,910
the role of inn staff.

134
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,440
I came up with his back story,

135
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,230
his manner of speech,

136
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,080
his behaviour,

137
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,200
and the details of his murder.

138
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,840
I pondered over them.

139
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:58,670
Look.

140
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,280
When I die,

141
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,710
every detail has to be on point.

142
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,320
The detail

143
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,640
is what makes it so real.

144
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,670
Understood?

145
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,200
I don't get it.

146
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,150
It's fine.

147
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,440
When school starts,

148
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,640
we can discuss

149
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,550
about arts.

150
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,110
I'm very...

151
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:12,790
Ou Si Ke,

152
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,520
stop rambling.

153
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,400
When you were fighting
against Mr. Zhao,

154
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,790
you used two skills.

155
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,030
But they weren't Soul Skills.

156
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,550
What then?

157
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,200
They weren't Soul Skills indeed.

158
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,670
Just some tricks up my sleeve.

159
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,470
Shi Lan Ke

160
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,200
doesn't like dirty tricks.

161
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,080
It's not dirty tricks.

162
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,400
A Martial Soul Battle

163
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,550
without Soul Skill.

164
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,840
Isn't this cheating?

165
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,000
Tang San only has two Soul Rings.

166
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,440
To fight someone with seven Soul Rings,

167
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,520
we needed other strategies.

168
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,910
Martial Soul Battle has to be fair.

169
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,080
He was cheating.

170
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,030
Dai Mu Bai.

171
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,760
The rules say that

172
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,230
if they can defeat me,

173
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,960
they pass the exam.

174
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,840
Tang San did it.

175
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,550
We can't

176
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,710
reject someone just because

177
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,030
we haven't seen his techniques before.

178
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,760
Don't you think?

179
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,400
So,

180
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,760
everyone here now

181
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,280
has passed the exam.

182
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:08,440
Besides,

183
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,400
the potential

184
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,400
and will power you showed

185
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,150
are freakish.

186
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,080
Excellent.

187
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,280
Dai Mu Bai.

188
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,110
Tell Headmaster that

189
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,960
I'm leaving.

190
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,840
Wait.

191
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,150
Let me introduce to you all.

192
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,080
Mr. Zhao Wu Ji,

193
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,590
one of our earliest

194
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,760
graduates.

195
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,230
He also used to

196
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,550
teach here.

197
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,520
Used to?

198
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,640
Due to the lack of funds,

199
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,400
we can't hire teachers anymore.

200
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:38,960
But Mr. Zhao

201
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,520
still helps us with the admission exam.

202
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,670
Maybe it's because I look like a villain.

203
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,080
No, not at all.

204
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,550
You have potential.

205
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,000
Work hard.

206
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,200
Shi Lan Ke won't let you down.

207
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,710
Goodbye, sir.

208
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,470
Goodbye, sir.

209
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,590
All right. Rest well.

210
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,280
I'll show you the school tomorrow.

211
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,150
Let's go.

212
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,080
I'm not here for enrollment.

213
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,400
I'm here for you, Dai Mu Bai.

214
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,670
Are you afraid of a duel?

215
00:15:26,694 --> 00:15:36,694
Sub by WeTV & Ripped by skysoultan
♔ Follow @skysoultan on Instagram ♔

216
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:44,910
Stop.

217
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,670
You can't win.

218
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,200
Purple? Millennium Soul Ring.

219
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,200
Triple Soul Rings. Soul Honour?

220
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,880
I killed a Millennium Supreme Tiger

221
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,320
and obtained the third Soul Ring.

222
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,710
White Tiger Vajra Transformation

223
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,520
will boost my combat power

224
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,550
and defense greatly.

225
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,200
Speed too.

226
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,110
I won't give up.

227
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,000
I will defeat you.

228
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,400
Boring.

229
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,960
Miss, I have an idea.

230
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,670
You already paid up.

231
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,710
You passed the exam too.

232
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,150
Why not study here?

233
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,400
I'm not here for enrollment.

234
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,200
Look,

235
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,000
in school,

236
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,640
we are always together.

237
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,640
You can duel

238
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,590
Dai Mu Bai at any time.

239
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,880
Also, Dai Mu Bai is strong.

240
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,110
What does it mean?

241
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,150
What?

242
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,550
It means Shi Lan Ke School

243
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,470
is good.

244
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,760
When you study here,

245
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,200
you'll defeat him in no time.

246
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,150
That's true.

247
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,790
In that case,

248
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,760
you'll

249
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,320
need to pay again.

250
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,110
But I already paid up.

251
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,910
You paid the registration fee
this afternoon.

252
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,440
You fought Dai Mu Bai

253
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,350
once.

254
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,590
And now, you need to

255
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,470
pay the tuition fee.

256
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,760
After you pay up,

257
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,790
the teacher

258
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,590
will train you.

259
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,030
You'll improve

260
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:16,710
and defeat him.

261
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,680
No?

262
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,400
Oh...

263
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,350
Rest well.

264
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,160
School tomorrow!

265
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:28,350
Hey.

266
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,000
How did you hurt Mr. Zhao?

267
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,230
When I saw you lose consciousness,

268
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,520
I lost control of myself.

269
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,800
Everything was out of reflex.

270
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,160
Not using Martial Soul?

271
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,350
But I might have

272
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,400
combined both Xuan Tian Strike

273
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,680
and the Martial Soul.

274
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,040
I didn't expect it to negate

275
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,160
the opponent's Martial Soul.

276
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,230
Xuan Tian Strike?

277
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,070
It's a technique from Xuan Tian Records.

278
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,230
It augments my breath.

279
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,430
Under Xuan Tian Strike's protection,

280
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,560
Mr. Zhao's damage against

281
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,680
my Martial Soul has decreased.

282
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,040
His palm

283
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,040
didn't hurt as much.

284
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,110
Try again, perhaps?

285
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:49,950
What?

286
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,680
Impossible.

287
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,520
Combining them

288
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,760
makes them repel each other.

289
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,160
Don't try again then.

290
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,590
How did it work that time then?

291
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,070
What exactly is Xuan Tian Strike?

292
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,800
How much loss
do we have to cover this time?

293
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,830
What's up?

294
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,880
You were just watching just now.

295
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:28,880
So?

296
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,430
It means

297
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,430
it doesn't count.

298
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,400
It's not about money.

299
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:41,590
You know that, right?

300
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,710
Doesn't the school need funding?

301
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,470
It's not the case.

302
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,280
Bring me to the school tomorrow.

303
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,950
I'll talk to the headmaster.

304
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,830
Headmaster.

305
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,760
The girl who wanted to duel Dai Mu Bai

306
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,160
paid again.

307
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,590
The more the merrier.

308
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,230
Of course.

309
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,310
This

310
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,350
is the money from the girl
who just watched.

311
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,590
She wanted to talk to you.

312
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,430
I feel like

313
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,350
she means trouble.

314
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,190
Careful. We're almost there.

315
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,470
This is Shi Lan Ke.

316
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,310
Miss,

317
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,110
why are you using this for laundry?

318
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,830
This is not an ordinary plank.

319
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,560
This is...

320
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,560
This...

321
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,640
Here.

322
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,110
Shi Lan Ke.

323
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,710
Is this the school?

324
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,520
Yes.

325
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,310
Are they students?

326
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,830
They are...

327
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,400
They are villagers.

328
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,040
She enrolled.

329
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,160
So we take anyone in now?

330
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,230
She passed the exam

331
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,350
and she paid twice.

332
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,590
No reason not to take her in.

333
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,640
Is this village the school?

334
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:47,680
No,

335
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,310
the school is in the village.

336
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,040
Where's the dorm?

337
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,950
We don't have that.

338
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,280
Careful.

339
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,110
Slow and steady.

340
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:58,830
Headmaster!

341
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,280
You're the headmaster? Headmaster?

342
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,000
Yes.

343
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,800
I'm the headmaster of Shi Lan Ke,

344
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,400
Lander.

345
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,070
On behalf of Shi Lan Ke's
students and staff,

346
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,560
welcome.

347
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,310
Students and staff?

348
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,110
Other than the freshers,

349
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,880
I only see 3 people.

350
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,070
Our Headmaster is very petty.

351
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,350
You're dead meat.

352
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,920
We're poor.

353
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,280
This is what we have.

354
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,040
We'll tell you more later.

355
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,190
Mu Bai.

356
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,070
See if something
needs to be repaired there.

357
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:31,950
Bring them over.

358
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:32,430
Sure.

359
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,350
Come with me.

360
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,800
Repair?

361
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,470
Come.

362
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,160
Repair what?

363
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,470
You stay here.

364
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,950
Dai!

365
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,830
The Hu girl

366
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,710
treats you differently.

367
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,640
You don't know her?

368
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,190
No.

369
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,590
Think harder.

370
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,230
Maybe you forgot.

371
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,830
Headmaster didn't want to take her in.

372
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,280
Then she asked for a private talk.

373
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,830
She said she could help the school.

374
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,680
What can a girl do

375
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,640
to help the school?

376
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,160
Does our school have a problem?

377
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,400
Our biggest problem

378
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,230
is nosy students.

379
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,680
This is directed towards me, isn't it?

380
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,950
So this Hu girl

381
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:09,710
is coming for me?

382
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:10,950
But why?

383
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:11,830
Also,

384
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,040
the way she looks at you

385
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,680
is different.

386
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,800
Perhaps she has met

387
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,590
with Headmaster before?

388
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,950
A private talk...

389
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,040
Maybe

390
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,950
she is Headmaster's

391
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:22,710
long-lost daughter?

392
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,070
She's back now.

393
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,000
This story is too intriguing.

394
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,920
Quality content, Dai.

395
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,070
Quality content.

396
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,070
In that case,

397
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,470
you should eavesdrop.

398
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,470
I probably should.

399
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,400
I'll see you then.

400
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,190
Ignore him. He's crazy.

401
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,040
I can't believe

402
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,920
the famous Devil's School

403
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,920
hides in a village.

404
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,070
It's not hiding.

405
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,070
The rent here is cheap.

406
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,520
That's because you want to stay neutral.

407
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,160
Hence there are restrictions everywhere.

408
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,520
You know a lot.

409
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,470
Shi Lan Ke School

410
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,400
might be the only neutral school

411
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,280
on Douluo Continent.

412
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,470
Without sponsorship,

413
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,400
you guys are poor.

414
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,560
We're poor

415
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,160
but we're free.

416
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,190
I heard

417
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,710
the governor of Suo Tuo City

418
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,190
wants to cancel your school license.

419
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,350
He'll act soon.

420
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,640
Surely you want to know

421
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,760
how I got this information.

422
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,160
I know who you are.

423
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,520
Come with me.

424
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,280
No.

425
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,040
Wait, yes.

426
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:51,830
But...

427
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,190
Brother Ou.

428
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,160
We want to go back to town.

429
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,310
Can you be our guide?

430
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,280
Ou Si Ke will do.

431
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,520
We'll leave soon.

432
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,590
What are you looking at?

433
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,310
This Hu girl

434
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,760
went in with Headmaster.

435
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,040
You're stalking Headmaster?

436
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,560
Why are you bothered by it?

437
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,470
I'm just curious.

438
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,830
An artist draws inspiration

439
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,560
from his life.

440
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,190
Okay?

441
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,470
I need to stay

442
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,040
curious and excited.

443
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,800
A strong curiosity towards life

444
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,400
compels me to study

445
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,160
any

446
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,190
novelties that I encounter.

447
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,350
Look!

448
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,920
Over there.

449
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,110
Anything can happen

450
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,280
there.

451
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,110
My imagination can even

452
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,640
make a spectacle out of it.

453
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,400
When I write,

454
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,430
it will flow naturally.

455
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,520
Well, if it's purely fictional,

456
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,950
isn't that lying then?

457
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:59,710
It's all gibberish.

458
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,230
You don't understand.

459
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,070
People nowadays

460
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,230
don't want to believe

461
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,520
anything real.

462
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,800
They prefer

463
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,110
something dramatic.

464
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,190
This is the charm of art.

465
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,470
Got it?

466
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,470
I tell him...

467
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,640
Then...

468
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,470
When I'm composing,

469
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,110
I'm more of a lone wolf.

470
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,950
I'll tell you once I'm done.

471
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,640
What is he talking about?

472
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,190
Maybe he doesn't want to be disturbed.

473
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,560
Let's go somewhere.

474
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,280
We can wait.

475
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,640
Since you're waiting,

476
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,470
check this out.

477
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:49,920
Hurry up.

478
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,070
What is this?

479
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,040
My heart and soul.

480
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,710
Careful.

481
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,040
Don't come here, Headmaster.

482
00:26:59,190 --> 00:26:59,830
Please.

483
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,560
This guy has been following you.

484
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,000
In fact, he's been protecting you.

485
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,470
Right?

486
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,590
What did you do to him?

487
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,680
Nothing.

488
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,950
He's just immobilized.

489
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,920
If I'm not mistaken,

490
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,160
he's an officer

491
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,190
from Martial Soul Hall. Like you, right?

492
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,070
Yes.

493
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:22,430
So?

494
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,680
Martial Soul Hall likes my school now?

495
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,830
Martial Soul Hall
has nothing to do with it.

496
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,350
It's a personal matter.

497
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,560
Someone from Martial Soul Hall

498
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,520
wants to join another school?

499
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,000
I remember you said

500
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,640
Shi Lan Ke welcomes everyone.

501
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:38,880
Except for Martial Soul Hall.

502
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,470
The governor of Suo Tuo City wants

503
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,560
to revoke your school license.

504
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:43,710
I can help.

505
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,590
Are you threatening me?

506
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,680
You're mistaken.

507
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,950
It's a favor.

508
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,070
In exchange for your enrollment?

509
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,350
I'll audit.

510
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,000
I won't be a student.

511
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,280
Don't worry.

512
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,560
Audit?

513
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,400
Yes.

514
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,280
I will also pay

515
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,640
for auditing.

516
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,710
I know

517
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,640
the school needs funding.

518
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,280
Martial Soul Hall

519
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,230
has the best resource on Douluo Continent.

520
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,430
Why do you wish to join Shi Lan Ke?

521
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,830
For Dai Mu Bai.

522
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,920
Dai Mu Bai?

523
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,400
Are you two related?

524
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,800
Not at all.

525
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,640
We might be in the future.

526
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,470
You're not allowed to recruit

527
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,520
for Martial Soul Hall.

528
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,760
I swear not to.

529
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,680
You'll only audit. No lectures for you.

530
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,350
Thanks, Headmaster.

531
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,070
He's not allowed to enter the school.

532
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,760
As you wish.

533
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,280
Don't worry.

534
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,680
The school is safe.

535
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,280
Headmaster will protect me.

536
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,000
I will stay in Suo Tuo City.

537
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,000
Find me if anything.

538
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,400
An officer takes orders from you.

539
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,520
Where does that guy come from?

540
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,710
It's him.

541
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,190
Do you know him?

542
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,560
He's Su Yun Tao,

543
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,280
an officer from Martial Soul Hall.

544
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,470
He helped me to

545
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,040
awaken my Martial Soul.

546
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,520
Martial Soul Hall?

547
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,190
This is complicated.

548
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,400
My play.

549
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,160
How is it?

550
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,430
Do you like it?

551
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,280
This...

552
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,800
Yes, this.

553
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,520
I wrote this.

554
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,230
My biggest dream

555
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,350
is to be

556
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,430
an actor in a circus,

557
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,310
performing the play I wrote.

558
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,680
I will bring art

559
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,830
to every corner of Douluo Continent.

560
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,640
When that day comes,

561
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,920
I'll die without regret.

562
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:10,950
Excuse me,

563
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,400
but one question.

564
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,950
You're a Soul Master, aren't you?

565
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:14,760
Yes.

566
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:15,760
But...

567
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,280
Having a Martial Soul

568
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,000
doesn't mean I have to be a Soul Master.

569
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:19,950
Don't you think

570
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,230
my dream serves a greater purpose?

571
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,310
Art!

572
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,830
My dream is to make art.

573
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,000
I'm sorry.

574
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,070
We're not good with arts.

575
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,280
It's fine.

576
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,430
Everyone is equal in front of art.

577
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:32,950
So,

578
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,230
how's my play?

579
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:37,950
It's not bad.

580
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,230
How so?

581
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,190
Just tell me honestly.

582
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,520
The play is good

583
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,350
but the villain inside is weird.

584
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,760
He has no motives.

585
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:51,760
You...

586
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,830
I made that up.

587
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:54,830
Spot on.

588
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,800
In this play,

589
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,950
the villain's motive and plot

590
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,040
are the weakest points.

591
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,560
You noticed straight away.

592
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,710
You're good, Tang San.

593
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:04,920
Are you professional?

594
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,710
No, I made it up.

595
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,280
Even more impressive!

596
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,070
Instinct is an artist's

597
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,710
greatest weapon.

598
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,680
Don't you know?

599
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,950
We should discuss

600
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,350
the villain's character.

601
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:16,950
How about it?

602
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,710
We want to go to the town, Ou.

603
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,470
I'll guide you two.

604
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,280
Let's discuss on the way.

605
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,520
Wu!

606
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,160
Do you like my play?

607
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:34,800
Yes, yes.

608
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,110
Did you notice the plot twist?

609
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,470
He thought he knew that.

610
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,400
Do you like it?

611
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:49,460
<i>Rose Inn</i>

612
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,590
Normally,

613
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,640
those who guide freshers

614
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,430
will wait here for announcements.

615
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,070
Why is the door locked then?

616
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,710
Lander founded Rose Inn.

617
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,280
It was meant to make a profit

618
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,880
and fund Shi Lan Ke school.

619
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,110
No one visited the inn,

620
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,400
so every year

621
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,110
it becomes the place for the admission exam.

622
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,110
It only opened once,
then it closed down.

623
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,430
Why is the school so poor?

624
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,160
Let me tell you.

625
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,800
In Suo Tuo City, the Seven Clans

626
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,040
and other parties

627
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,430
tried to fund us,

628
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,000
but we refused them.

629
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,190
Why?

630
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,000
Headmaster said:

631
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,800
"I don't want

632
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,190
Shi Lan Ke to be sponsored by anyone

633
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,040
because

634
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:33,920
the school

635
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,430
will then become a pawn.

636
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,680
I'm responsible for my students.

637
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,470
And

638
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,110
I don't want

639
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,880
my students

640
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,950
to take sides

641
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,760
and have their path set in stone

642
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,710
before they discover who they truly are.

643
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,590
This is plain irresponsible.

644
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,430
Do you understand?

645
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,560
It sounds dumb, right?

646
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,190
It's decent.

647
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:00,430
I quite...

648
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,920
Pick your own path, right?

649
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,680
Of course.

650
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,040
I already know

651
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,880
where I want to go.

652
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,560
I will be an actor.

653
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:08,830
I will write plays.

654
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,160
I will create arts.

655
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,040
Did Headmaster encourage you

656
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,430
after knowing your decision?

657
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,040
He also said that

658
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,680
if I didn't change my dream,

659
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,470
he'd burn all my plays.

660
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,230
That reminds me that

661
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,430
I should stow away

662
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,350
my plays later.

663
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,230
Thank you.

664
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,230
Master!

665
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,560
We passed the exam.

666
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,230
What happened, sir?

667
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,830
After I ushered you two in yesterday,

668
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,760
someone from Martial Soul Hall

669
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,640
entered Rose Inn.

670
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,310
This is Rose Inn.

671
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,160
Let me show you what I wrote.

672
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,040
Are they here

673
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,230
for what happened in Nuoding?

674
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,280
No one came to us.

675
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,160
Only students were present yesterday.

676
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,710
Good then.

677
00:33:58,950 --> 00:33:59,950
You're still wanted.

678
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,710
Be cautious.

679
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:02,590
Noted.

680
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,640
Hi.

681
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,590
Are you Tang San's teacher?

682
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:11,800
I'm from Shi Lan Ke,

683
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,110
Ou...

684
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:13,830
Ou Si Ke.

685
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:17,590
By the way,

686
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,280
amongst the students,

687
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,590
did you notice someone

688
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:21,520
with a bamboo hat?

689
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:23,910
bamboo hat?

690
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:24,910
Yes.

691
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:26,520
Oriental hat.

692
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:27,950
She's called

693
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:28,800
Hu Lie Na.

694
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,360
You know, this girl...

695
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,520
If she ever acts,

696
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,910
she's perfect

697
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:36,760
for a cunning and complex villain.

698
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,560
This reminds me of Headmaster.

699
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,630
Headmaster has always been single.

700
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,840
Based on my observations,

701
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,760
he has zero luck with girls.

702
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,040
But this time, he spent

703
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,840
a long time

704
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,040
talking to her in a room.

705
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,280
It's his own room.

706
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,080
There's a stranger inside too.

707
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,430
Something's fishy.

708
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,710
Please summarise everything in ten words.

709
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:03,320
She was then talking
to Headmaster privately in his room.

710
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,280
Ten words.

711
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,390
Ten words!

712
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,000
Right?

713
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,670
Exactly ten.

714
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:11,840
Master...

715
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,560
I feel like

716
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,760
the stories I want to tell

717
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,320
should be told succinctly,

718
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,360
with easy-to-understand words.

719
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,710
That's how it should be.

720
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,230
The audience will understand

721
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,000
my stories better.

722
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,230
Thanks, Master.

723
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,080
Thank you.

724
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,430
You gave me an epiphany.

725
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,910
Headmaster is what Hu Lie Na wants.

726
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,760
She might be from Martial Soul Hall too.

727
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,630
When did Shi Lan Ke

728
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,600
become associated

729
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,360
with Martial Soul Hall?

730
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,800
We're not related

731
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,710
to Martial Soul Hall at all.

732
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,360
Su Yun Tao was there too.

733
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,080
Was he who you wanted to meet?
