<i>Episode 8</i>

15
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,400
I'm not from Shi Lan Ke.

16
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,760
I'm just an inn staff.

17
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,440
I...

18
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,000
To put it simply,

19
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,550
Shi Lan Ke School and I have a history.

20
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,510
Rose Inn helps Shi Lan Ke

21
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,040
organize the admission exam,

22
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,400
which means it's just as guilty.

23
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,270
I have nothing to do with it.

24
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,910
Whoever joins Shi Lan Ke

25
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,830
will be my enemy.

26
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,950
Should we save him?

27
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,360
Is this part of the exam?

28
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,480
You think so?

29
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,670
I know

30
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,600
some might think

31
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,470
this is the admission exam.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,910
Tell me now.

33
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,470
How can I let them know

34
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,240
that I'm serious?

35
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,470
I...

36
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,160
I don't know.

37
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,000
I'll kill you

38
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,830
to prove it.

39
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,160
Come here.

40
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,800
This is your last moment.

41
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,960
At least look dignified.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,390
I'm not one of them.

43
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,910
I have nothing to do with them.

44
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,320
It doesn't look like an exam.

45
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,910
Shi Lan Ke picked this inn.

46
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,800
You only have your bad luck to blame.

47
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,800
Quadruple Soul Rings. Soul Sect.

48
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,000
My vine

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,190
can't reach him.

50
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,110
I'll finish my business,

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,910
then I'll entertain you two.

52
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,470
Let him go.

53
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,750
Supreme Palm.

54
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,080
Nether Spikes.

55
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,320
Ou Si Ke!

56
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,200
See it now?

57
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,480
This is what happened

58
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,790
when you want to join Shi Lan Ke.

59
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,790
Shi Lan Ke

60
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,350
won't come and protect you.

61
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,790
If you stay,

62
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,320
you'll be my enemy.

63
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,000
Can I quit?

64
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,350
Those who want to quit,

65
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,550
do it now.

66
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,230
Why did you kill him?

67
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,110
He's just a staff.

68
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,110
He's not related to the school.

69
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,720
Bad timing then.

70
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,440
His fate has been decided.

71
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,760
Killing people
doesn't make you stronger.

72
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,640
It only shows that you can't control

73
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,390
yourself.

74
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,160
Audacious kid.

75
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,670
Everyone can leave

76
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,640
but you have to stay.

77
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,760
Are kids nowadays this reckless?

78
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,950
Wu.

79
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,320
Speed can increase power.

80
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,760
First Soul skill.

81
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,760
Acala's Statue.

82
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,640
Wu!

83
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,320
Wu.

84
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,230
Sorry, brother.

85
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
I made you worry.

86
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,040
It's my fault.

87
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,480
I couldn't protect you.

88
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,950
I'm sorry.

89
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,480
I'm sorry.

90
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,960
If forbearance means I'll lose someone,

91
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,200
then even if

92
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,790
I'll die,

93
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,790
I will avenge my sister.

94
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,230
Without using Martial Soul?

95
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,350
What technique did you use?

96
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,960
Again.

97
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,550
This is Gravity Squeeze.

98
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,110
You'd better stay put.

99
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,440
Seven Soul Rings!

100
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,840
He's a Soul Saint.

101
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,150
Brother.

102
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,960
Tang San.

103
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,200
Who are you?

104
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,280
Tang San.

105
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,000
Tang San.

106
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,440
Are you okay, Wu?

107
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,710
No need to continue.

108
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,910
You guys passed.

109
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,520
What do you mean?

110
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,840
This is a test

111
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,110
from Shi Lan Ke.

112
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,470
It tests your ability

113
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,080
and your bravery.

114
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,150
You little freaks all passed.

115
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,840
You kill someone just for a test.

116
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,080
Hey, time's up.

117
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,840
Did you really think that I was dead?

118
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,350
How was my acting?

119
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:18,880
Come.

120
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,280
Weren't you...

121
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,910
Let me introduce myself again.

122
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,880
I'm Ou Si Ke from

123
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,550
Shi Lan Ke.

124
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,000
Remember me, Ou Si Ke.

125
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,280
How was my acting?

126
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,590
Tell me.

127
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,350
It's almost

128
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,670
real.

129
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,150
You know why?

130
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,230
I studied my character

131
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,230
diligently.

132
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,910
I even gave myself

133
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,910
the role of inn staff.

134
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,440
I came up with his back story,

135
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,230
his manner of speech,

136
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,080
his behaviour,

137
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,200
and the details of his murder.

138
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,840
I pondered over them.

139
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:52,670
Look.

140
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,280
When I die,

141
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,710
every detail has to be on point.

142
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,320
The detail

143
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,640
is what makes it so real.

144
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,670
Understood?

145
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,200
I don't get it.

146
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,150
It's fine.

147
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,440
When school starts,

148
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,640
we can discuss

149
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,550
about arts.

150
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,110
I'm very...

151
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:06,790
Ou Si Ke,

152
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,520
stop rambling.

153
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,400
When you were fighting
against Mr. Zhao,

154
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,790
you used two skills.

155
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,030
But they weren't Soul Skills.

156
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,550
What then?

157
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,200
They weren't Soul Skills indeed.

158
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,670
Just some tricks up my sleeve.

159
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,470
Shi Lan Ke

160
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,200
doesn't like dirty tricks.

161
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,080
It's not dirty tricks.

162
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,400
A Martial Soul Battle

163
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,550
without Soul Skill.

164
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,840
Isn't this cheating?

165
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,000
Tang San only has two Soul Rings.

166
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,440
To fight someone with seven Soul Rings,

167
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,520
we needed other strategies.

168
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,910
Martial Soul Battle has to be fair.

169
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,080
He was cheating.

170
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,030
Dai Mu Bai.

171
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,760
The rules say that

172
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,230
if they can defeat me,

173
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,960
they pass the exam.

174
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,840
Tang San did it.

175
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,550
We can't

176
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,710
reject someone just because

177
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,030
we haven't seen his techniques before.

178
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,760
Don't you think?

179
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,400
So,

180
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,760
everyone here now

181
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,280
has passed the exam.

182
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,440
Besides,

183
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,400
the potential

184
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,400
and will power you showed

185
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,150
are freakish.

186
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,080
Excellent.

187
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,280
Dai Mu Bai.

188
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,110
Tell Headmaster that

189
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,960
I'm leaving.

190
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:14,840
Wait.

191
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,150
Let me introduce to you all.

192
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,080
Mr. Zhao Wu Ji,

193
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,590
one of our earliest

194
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,760
graduates.

195
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,230
He also used to

196
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,550
teach here.

197
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,520
Used to?

198
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,640
Due to the lack of funds,

199
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,400
we can't hire teachers anymore.

200
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,960
But Mr. Zhao

201
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,520
still helps us with the admission exam.

202
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,670
Maybe it's because I look like a villain.

203
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,080
No, not at all.

204
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,550
You have potential.

205
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,000
Work hard.

206
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,200
Shi Lan Ke won't let you down.

207
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,710
Goodbye, sir.

208
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,470
Goodbye, sir.

209
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,590
All right. Rest well.

210
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,280
I'll show you the school tomorrow.

211
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,150
Let's go.

212
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,080
I'm not here for enrollment.

213
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,400
I'm here for you, Dai Mu Bai.

214
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,670
Are you afraid of a duel?

215
00:15:20,694 --> 00:15:30,694

♔ Follow @skysoultan on Instagram ♔

216
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,910
Stop.

217
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,670
You can't win.

218
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,200
Purple? Millennium Soul Ring.

219
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,200
Triple Soul Rings. Soul Honour?

220
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,880
I killed a Millennium Supreme Tiger

221
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,320
and obtained the third Soul Ring.

222
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,710
White Tiger Vajra Transformation

223
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,520
will boost my combat power

224
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,550
and defense greatly.

225
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,200
Speed too.

226
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,110
I won't give up.

227
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,000
I will defeat you.

228
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,400
Boring.

229
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,960
Miss, I have an idea.

230
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,670
You already paid up.

231
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,710
You passed the exam too.

232
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,150
Why not study here?

233
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,400
I'm not here for enrollment.

234
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,200
Look,

235
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,000
in school,

236
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,640
we are always together.

237
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,640
You can duel

238
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,590
Dai Mu Bai at any time.

239
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,880
Also, Dai Mu Bai is strong.

240
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,110
What does it mean?

241
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,150
What?

242
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,550
It means Shi Lan Ke School

243
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,470
is good.

244
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,760
When you study here,

245
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,200
you'll defeat him in no time.

246
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,150
That's true.

247
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,790
In that case,

248
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:55,760
you'll

249
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,320
need to pay again.

250
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,110
But I already paid up.

251
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,910
You paid the registration fee
this afternoon.

252
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,440
You fought Dai Mu Bai

253
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,350
once.

254
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,590
And now, you need to

255
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,470
pay the tuition fee.

256
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,760
After you pay up,

257
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,790
the teacher

258
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,590
will train you.

259
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,030
You'll improve

260
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,710
and defeat him.

261
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,680
No?

262
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,400
Oh...

263
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,350
Rest well.

264
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,160
School tomorrow!

265
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:22,350
Hey.

266
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,000
How did you hurt Mr. Zhao?

267
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,230
When I saw you lose consciousness,

268
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,520
I lost control of myself.

269
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,800
Everything was out of reflex.

270
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,160
Not using Martial Soul?

271
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,350
But I might have

272
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,400
combined both Xuan Tian Strike

273
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,680
and the Martial Soul.

274
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,040
I didn't expect it to negate

275
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,160
the opponent's Martial Soul.

276
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,230
Xuan Tian Strike?

277
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,070
It's a technique from Xuan Tian Records.

278
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,230
It augments my breath.

279
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,430
Under Xuan Tian Strike's protection,

280
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,560
Mr. Zhao's damage against

281
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,680
my Martial Soul has decreased.

282
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,040
His palm

283
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,040
didn't hurt as much.

284
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,110
Try again, perhaps?

285
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,950
What?

286
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,680
Impossible.

287
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,520
Combining them

288
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,760
makes them repel each other.

289
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,160
Don't try again then.

290
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,590
How did it work that time then?

291
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,070
What exactly is Xuan Tian Strike?

292
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,800
How much loss
do we have to cover this time?

293
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:17,830
What's up?

294
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,880
You were just watching just now.

295
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:22,880
So?

296
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,430
It means

297
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,430
it doesn't count.

298
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,400
It's not about money.

299
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,590
You know that, right?

300
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,710
Doesn't the school need funding?

301
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,470
It's not the case.

302
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,280
Bring me to the school tomorrow.

303
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,950
I'll talk to the headmaster.

304
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:01,830
Headmaster.

305
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,760
The girl who wanted to duel Dai Mu Bai

306
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,160
paid again.

307
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,590
The more the merrier.

308
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,230
Of course.

309
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,310
This

310
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,350
is the money from the girl
who just watched.

311
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,590
She wanted to talk to you.

312
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,430
I feel like

313
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,350
she means trouble.

314
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,190
Careful. We're almost there.

315
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,470
This is Shi Lan Ke.

316
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,310
Miss,

317
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,110
why are you using this for laundry?

318
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,830
This is not an ordinary plank.

319
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,560
This is...

320
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,560
This...

321
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,640
Here.

322
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,110
Shi Lan Ke.

323
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,710
Is this the school?

324
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,520
Yes.

325
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,310
Are they students?

326
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:21,830
They are...

327
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,400
They are villagers.

328
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,040
She enrolled.

329
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,160
So we take anyone in now?

330
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,230
She passed the exam

331
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,350
and she paid twice.

332
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,590
No reason not to take her in.

333
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,640
Is this village the school?

334
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,680
No,

335
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,310
the school is in the village.

336
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,040
Where's the dorm?

337
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,950
We don't have that.

338
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,280
Careful.

339
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,110
Slow and steady.

340
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,830
Headmaster!

341
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,280
You're the headmaster? Headmaster?

342
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,000
Yes.

343
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,800
I'm the headmaster of Shi Lan Ke,

344
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,400
Lander.

345
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,070
On behalf of Shi Lan Ke's
students and staff,

346
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,560
welcome.

347
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,310
Students and staff?

348
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,110
Other than the freshers,

349
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,880
I only see 3 people.

350
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,070
Our Headmaster is very petty.

351
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,350
You're dead meat.

352
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,920
We're poor.

353
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,280
This is what we have.

354
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,040
We'll tell you more later.

355
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,190
Mu Bai.

356
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,070
See if something
needs to be repaired there.

357
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:25,950
Bring them over.

358
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,430
Sure.

359
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,350
Come with me.

360
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,800
Repair?

361
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,470
Come.

362
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,160
Repair what?

363
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:36,470
You stay here.

364
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,950
Dai!

365
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,830
The Hu girl

366
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,710
treats you differently.

367
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,640
You don't know her?

368
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,190
No.

369
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,590
Think harder.

370
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,230
Maybe you forgot.

371
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,830
Headmaster didn't want to take her in.

372
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,280
Then she asked for a private talk.

373
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,830
She said she could help the school.

374
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,680
What can a girl do

375
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,640
to help the school?

376
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,160
Does our school have a problem?

377
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,400
Our biggest problem

378
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,230
is nosy students.

379
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,680
This is directed towards me, isn't it?

380
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,950
So this Hu girl

381
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,710
is coming for me?

382
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:04,950
But why?

383
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:05,830
Also,

384
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,040
the way she looks at you

385
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,680
is different.

386
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,800
Perhaps she has met

387
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,590
with Headmaster before?

388
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:10,950
A private talk...

389
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,040
Maybe

390
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,950
she is Headmaster's

391
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:16,710
long-lost daughter?

392
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,070
She's back now.

393
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,000
This story is too intriguing.

394
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,920
Quality content, Dai.

395
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,070
Quality content.

396
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,070
In that case,

397
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,470
you should eavesdrop.

398
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,470
I probably should.

399
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,400
I'll see you then.

400
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,190
Ignore him. He's crazy.

401
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,040
I can't believe

402
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,920
the famous Devil's School

403
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,920
hides in a village.

404
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,070
It's not hiding.

405
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,070
The rent here is cheap.

406
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,520
That's because you want to stay neutral.

407
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,160
Hence there are restrictions everywhere.

408
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,520
You know a lot.

409
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,470
Shi Lan Ke School

410
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,400
might be the only neutral school

411
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,280
on Douluo Continent.

412
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,470
Without sponsorship,

413
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,400
you guys are poor.

414
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,560
We're poor

415
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,160
but we're free.

416
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,190
I heard

417
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,710
the governor of Suo Tuo City

418
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,190
wants to cancel your school license.

419
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,350
He'll act soon.

420
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,640
Surely you want to know

421
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,760
how I got this information.

422
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,160
I know who you are.

423
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,520
Come with me.

424
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,280
No.

425
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,040
Wait, yes.

426
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:45,830
But...

427
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,190
Brother Ou.

428
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,160
We want to go back to town.

429
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,310
Can you be our guide?

430
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,280
Ou Si Ke will do.

431
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,520
We'll leave soon.

432
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,590
What are you looking at?

433
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,310
This Hu girl

434
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,760
went in with Headmaster.

435
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,040
You're stalking Headmaster?

436
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,560
Why are you bothered by it?

437
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,470
I'm just curious.

438
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,830
An artist draws inspiration

439
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,560
from his life.

440
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,190
Okay?

441
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,470
I need to stay

442
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,040
curious and excited.

443
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,800
A strong curiosity towards life

444
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,400
compels me to study

445
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,160
any

446
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,190
novelties that I encounter.

447
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:33,350
Look!

448
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,920
Over there.

449
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,110
Anything can happen

450
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,280
there.

451
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,110
My imagination can even

452
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,640
make a spectacle out of it.

453
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,400
When I write,

454
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,430
it will flow naturally.

455
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:51,520
Well, if it's purely fictional,

456
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,950
isn't that lying then?

457
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:53,710
It's all gibberish.

458
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,230
You don't understand.

459
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,070
People nowadays

460
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,230
don't want to believe

461
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,520
anything real.

462
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,800
They prefer

463
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,110
something dramatic.

464
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,190
This is the charm of art.

465
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,470
Got it?

466
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,470
I tell him...

467
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,640
Then...

468
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,470
When I'm composing,

469
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,110
I'm more of a lone wolf.

470
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,950
I'll tell you once I'm done.

471
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,640
What is he talking about?

472
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,190
Maybe he doesn't want to be disturbed.

473
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,560
Let's go somewhere.

474
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,280
We can wait.

475
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,640
Since you're waiting,

476
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,470
check this out.

477
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:43,920
Hurry up.

478
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,070
What is this?

479
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,040
My heart and soul.

480
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,710
Careful.

481
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,040
Don't come here, Headmaster.

482
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:53,830
Please.

483
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,560
This guy has been following you.

484
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,000
In fact, he's been protecting you.

485
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,470
Right?

486
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,590
What did you do to him?

487
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,680
Nothing.

488
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,950
He's just immobilized.

489
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,920
If I'm not mistaken,

490
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,160
he's an officer

491
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,190
from Martial Soul Hall. Like you, right?

492
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,070
Yes.

493
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:16,430
So?

494
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,680
Martial Soul Hall likes my school now?

495
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,830
Martial Soul Hall
has nothing to do with it.

496
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,350
It's a personal matter.

497
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,560
Someone from Martial Soul Hall

498
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,520
wants to join another school?

499
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,000
I remember you said

500
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,640
Shi Lan Ke welcomes everyone.

501
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:32,880
Except for Martial Soul Hall.

502
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,470
The governor of Suo Tuo City wants

503
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,560
to revoke your school license.

504
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,710
I can help.

505
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,590
Are you threatening me?

506
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,680
You're mistaken.

507
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,950
It's a favor.

508
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,070
In exchange for your enrollment?

509
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,350
I'll audit.

510
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,000
I won't be a student.

511
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,280
Don't worry.

512
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,560
Audit?

513
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,400
Yes.

514
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,280
I will also pay

515
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,640
for auditing.

516
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,710
I know

517
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,640
the school needs funding.

518
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,280
Martial Soul Hall

519
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,230
has the best resource on Douluo Continent.

520
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,430
Why do you wish to join Shi Lan Ke?

521
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,830
For Dai Mu Bai.

522
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,920
Dai Mu Bai?

523
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,400
Are you two related?

524
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,800
Not at all.

525
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,640
We might be in the future.

526
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,470
You're not allowed to recruit

527
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,520
for Martial Soul Hall.

528
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,760
I swear not to.

529
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,680
You'll only audit. No lectures for you.

530
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,350
Thanks, Headmaster.

531
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,070
He's not allowed to enter the school.

532
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,760
As you wish.

533
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,280
Don't worry.

534
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,680
The school is safe.

535
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,280
Headmaster will protect me.

536
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,000
I will stay in Suo Tuo City.

537
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,000
Find me if anything.

538
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,400
An officer takes orders from you.

539
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,520
Where does that guy come from?

540
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,710
It's him.

541
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,190
Do you know him?

542
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,560
He's Su Yun Tao,

543
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,280
an officer from Martial Soul Hall.

544
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,470
He helped me to

545
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,040
awaken my Martial Soul.

546
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,520
Martial Soul Hall?

547
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,190
This is complicated.

548
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,400
My play.

549
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,160
How is it?

550
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,430
Do you like it?

551
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:47,280
This...

552
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:47,800
Yes, this.

553
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,520
I wrote this.

554
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,230
My biggest dream

555
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,350
is to be

556
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,430
an actor in a circus,

557
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,310
performing the play I wrote.

558
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,680
I will bring art

559
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,830
to every corner of Douluo Continent.

560
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,640
When that day comes,

561
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,920
I'll die without regret.

562
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:04,950
Excuse me,

563
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,400
but one question.

564
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,950
You're a Soul Master, aren't you?

565
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:08,760
Yes.

566
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:09,760
But...

567
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,280
Having a Martial Soul

568
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,000
doesn't mean I have to be a Soul Master.

569
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:13,950
Don't you think

570
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,230
my dream serves a greater purpose?

571
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,310
Art!

572
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,830
My dream is to make art.

573
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,000
I'm sorry.

574
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,070
We're not good with arts.

575
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,280
It's fine.

576
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,430
Everyone is equal in front of art.

577
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:26,950
So,

578
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,230
how's my play?

579
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:31,950
It's not bad.

580
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,230
How so?

581
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,190
Just tell me honestly.

582
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,520
The play is good

583
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,350
but the villain inside is weird.

584
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,760
He has no motives.

585
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:45,760
You...

586
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,830
I made that up.

587
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:48,830
Spot on.

588
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,800
In this play,

589
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,950
the villain's motive and plot

590
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,040
are the weakest points.

591
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,560
You noticed straight away.

592
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,710
You're good, Tang San.

593
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:58,920
Are you professional?

594
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,710
No, I made it up.

595
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,280
Even more impressive!

596
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,070
Instinct is an artist's

597
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,710
greatest weapon.

598
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,680
Don't you know?

599
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,950
We should discuss

600
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,350
the villain's character.

601
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:10,950
How about it?

602
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,710
We want to go to the town, Ou.

603
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,470
I'll guide you two.

604
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,280
Let's discuss on the way.

605
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,520
Wu!

606
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,160
Do you like my play?

607
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:28,800
Yes, yes.

608
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,110
Did you notice the plot twist?

609
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,470
He thought he knew that.

610
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,400
Do you like it?

611
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:43,460
<i>Rose Inn</i>

612
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,590
Normally,

613
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,640
those who guide freshers

614
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,430
will wait here for announcements.

615
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,070
Why is the door locked then?

616
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,710
Lander founded Rose Inn.

617
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,280
It was meant to make a profit

618
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,880
and fund Shi Lan Ke school.

619
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,110
No one visited the inn,

620
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,400
so every year

621
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,110
it becomes the place for the admission exam.

622
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,110
It only opened once,
then it closed down.

623
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,430
Why is the school so poor?

624
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,160
Let me tell you.

625
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,800
In Suo Tuo City, the Seven Clans

626
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,040
and other parties

627
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,430
tried to fund us,

628
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,000
but we refused them.

629
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,190
Why?

630
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,000
Headmaster said:

631
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,800
"I don't want

632
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,190
Shi Lan Ke to be sponsored by anyone

633
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,040
because

634
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:27,920
the school

635
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,430
will then become a pawn.

636
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,680
I'm responsible for my students.

637
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,470
And

638
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,110
I don't want

639
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,880
my students

640
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,950
to take sides

641
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,760
and have their path set in stone

642
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,710
before they discover who they truly are.

643
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,590
This is plain irresponsible.

644
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,430
Do you understand?

645
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,560
It sounds dumb, right?

646
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,190
It's decent.

647
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:54,430
I quite...

648
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,920
Pick your own path, right?

649
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,680
Of course.

650
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,040
I already know

651
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,880
where I want to go.

652
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,560
I will be an actor.

653
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:02,830
I will write plays.

654
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,160
I will create arts.

655
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:08,040
Did Headmaster encourage you

656
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,430
after knowing your decision?

657
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,040
He also said that

658
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,680
if I didn't change my dream,

659
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,470
he'd burn all my plays.

660
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,230
That reminds me that

661
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,430
I should stow away

662
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,350
my plays later.

663
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,230
Thank you.

664
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,230
Master!

665
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,560
We passed the exam.

666
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,230
What happened, sir?

667
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,830
After I ushered you two in yesterday,

668
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,760
someone from Martial Soul Hall

669
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,640
entered Rose Inn.

670
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,310
This is Rose Inn.

671
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,160
Let me show you what I wrote.

672
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,040
Are they here

673
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,230
for what happened in Nuoding?

674
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,280
No one came to us.

675
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,160
Only students were present yesterday.

676
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,710
Good then.

677
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:53,950
You're still wanted.

678
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,710
Be cautious.

679
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:56,590
Noted.

680
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,640
Hi.

681
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,590
Are you Tang San's teacher?

682
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,800
I'm from Shi Lan Ke,

683
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,110
Ou...

684
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:07,830
Ou Si Ke.

685
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:11,590
By the way,

686
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,280
amongst the students,

687
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,590
did you notice someone

688
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:15,520
with a bamboo hat?

689
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,910
bamboo hat?

690
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:18,910
Yes.

691
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:20,520
Oriental hat.

692
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:21,950
She's called

693
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:22,800
Hu Lie Na.

694
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:24,360
You know, this girl...

695
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,520
If she ever acts,

696
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,910
she's perfect

697
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:30,760
for a cunning and complex villain.

698
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,560
This reminds me of Headmaster.

699
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,630
Headmaster has always been single.

700
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,840
Based on my observations,

701
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,760
he has zero luck with girls.

702
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,040
But this time, he spent

703
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,840
a long time

704
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,040
talking to her in a room.

705
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,280
It's his own room.

706
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,080
There's a stranger inside too.

707
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,430
Something's fishy.

708
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,710
Please summarise everything in ten words.

709
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:57,320
She was then talking
to Headmaster privately in his room.

710
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,280
Ten words.

711
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,390
Ten words!

712
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,000
Right?

713
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,670
Exactly ten.

714
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:05,840
Master...

715
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,560
I feel like

716
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,760
the stories I want to tell

717
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,320
should be told succinctly,

718
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,360
with easy-to-understand words.

719
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,710
That's how it should be.

720
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,230
The audience will understand

721
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,000
my stories better.

722
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,230
Thanks, Master.

723
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,080
Thank you.

724
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,430
You gave me an epiphany.

725
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,910
Headmaster is what Hu Lie Na wants.

726
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,760
She might be from Martial Soul Hall too.

727
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,630
When did Shi Lan Ke

728
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,600
become associated

729
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,360
with Martial Soul Hall?

730
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,800
We're not related

731
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,710
to Martial Soul Hall at all.

732
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,360
Su Yun Tao was there too.

733
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,080
Was he who you wanted to meet?
