<i>Episode 9</i>

15
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,390
When does Shi Lan Ke School

16
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,350
have something to do

17
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,180
with Martial Soul Hall?

18
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,540
Shi Lan Ke School

19
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,470
has no relation with them at all.

20
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,110
Is Su Yun Tao from
Martial Soul Hall there too?

21
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,820
Is he the one you want to meet?

22
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,260
Yes.

23
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,300
Yesterday, I stalked him.

24
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,070
I saw him

25
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,390
entered the City Main Office
of Suo Tuo City.

26
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,500
And now the city

27
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,470
is full of this notice.

28
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,070
They have admitted

29
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,940
Shi Lan Ke School's
teaching qualification?

30
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,350
Really?

31
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:21,990
I heard that Governor

32
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,820
always wants to dominate
Shi Lan Ke School.

33
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,620
However, your Headmaster rejected it.

34
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,590
That's true.

35
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,020
Governor decided

36
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,990
to target the school,

37
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,230
but he changed his mind suddenly.

38
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,510
And now the officer of
Martial Soul Hall appears.

39
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,430
This means that

40
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,740
Governor is oppressed by
Martial Soul Hall.

41
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,950
That's why he has to admit
the status of the school.

42
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,310
But Su Yun Tao is just an officer.

43
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,150
Is he able to influence
Governor's decision?

44
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,020
He is the direct disciple

45
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,740
of the chief of Martial Soul Hall.

46
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,710
His identity is prestigious.

47
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,950
The chief of Martial Soul Hall?

48
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,620
The invincible of Douluo Continent?

49
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,710
Why does he approach Headmaster?

50
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:55,990
Our Headmaster

51
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,310
is poor and ugly.

52
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,460
What's his intention then?

53
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,820
Are Su Yun Tao and Hu Lie Na

54
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,710
still in school?

55
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,020
When we went out just now,

56
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,900
Su Yun Tao has left.

57
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,150
Perhaps Hu Lie Na still stays.

58
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,820
I'm still worried.

59
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,020
Bring me to the school.

60
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,900
I want to see your Headmaster.

61
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:13,620
Sure.

62
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,350
Master,

63
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,820
it's okay for you
to meet with Headmaster.

64
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,020
However, his behaviour

65
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,990
is quite strange.

66
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,460
You have to get prepared.

67
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,230
Headmaster.

68
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,660
Someone is here to see you.

69
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,820
I've been looking for you
over the years,

70
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,510
yet I couldn't find you.

71
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,260
Where have you been?

72
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,740
Why are you looking for me?

73
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,660
To return me the money?

74
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:13,950
Regarding this matter,

75
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,540
don't say in front of them.

76
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,020
Gang.

77
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,430
Gang?

78
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,070
Since Golden Iron Triangle
has disbanded,

79
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,180
where have you been?

80
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,740
I was in Nuoding School,

81
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,350
working as a guest teacher
without any contribution.

82
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,710
But for this time,

83
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,220
I come here to send my disciple Tang San

84
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,100
and his sister, Wu for admission.

85
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,710
Is Tang San your disciple?

86
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,710
Why are you willing to send him here?

87
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,500
Because I have trust in you.

88
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,500
These two kids are talented.

89
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,030
Why didn't you inform me

90
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,500
before sending them here?

91
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,380
I hope that

92
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,710
they could enter into this school
with their ability.

93
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,310
You seem to have great confidence
in them.

94
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,310
Brother,

95
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,910
I have something to tell you.

96
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,780
Well.

97
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,100
Come to my place.

98
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:56,710
You all go and look for

99
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,870
those villagers

100
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,100
who need to do house maintenance

101
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,750
and help them out.

102
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,910
Remember to collect cash
when you finish that.

103
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,150
Issue a receipt
if they don't have cash.

104
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,500
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

105
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,500
Gang, come.

106
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,430
I've missed you so much.

107
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:09,380
Let's go.

108
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,260
Come.

109
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,590
Gang?

110
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,470
Come, Gang.

111
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,030
Please come in.

112
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,990
This is where I live.

113
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,340
It looks kind of shabby,

114
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,430
but it's a lovely place.

115
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,340
Welcome in.

116
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:21,710
Sure.

117
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,100
Here.

118
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,260
Have a seat.

119
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,500
Thank you, brother.

120
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,340
Have a seat.

121
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,190
I heard that you insisted
to run the school by yourself.

122
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,260
You only accept kids
that pass your test.

123
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,540
And they have become

124
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,630
great Soul Masters.

125
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,500
I do my best to teach them.

126
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,220
However, it's hard to keep
the school going.

127
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,060
I have to rely on the village
for the school

128
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,590
and help them with cleaning jobs

129
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,060
to square away teaching funds.

130
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,780
I can see that

131
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,190
they are the last batch of the school.

132
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,910
Well, stop complaining that you're poor.

133
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,870
To be honest, I'm somehow
envious of you.

134
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,710
Envious of your free life

135
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,590
and establishing an independent school.

136
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,260
Envious of me?

137
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,470
Stay here then.

138
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,540
Tang San and Wu wants to go to the city.

139
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,340
They are waiting for me.

140
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,060
I'll leave now.

141
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,500
Little brat.

142
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,150
What happened?

143
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:35,910
Ou Si Ke.

144
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,630
Get out of here. Don't eavesdrop.

145
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,710
Don't be angry.

146
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,590
I just want to reconfirm

147
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,220
the relationship between your school
and Martial Soul Hall.

148
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,380
You're asking about

149
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,220
the new girl from Martial Soul Hall,
right?

150
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,260
She came here for Dai Mu Bai.

151
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,060
Su Yun Tao brought her here.

152
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,590
He is the one who has awoken Tang San's
Martial Soul.

153
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,780
I heard that he is

154
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,100
the disciple of Bi Bi Dong,

155
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,430
the chief of Martial Soul Hall.

156
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,150
Sending a girl to Shi Lan Ke School

157
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,260
by himself,

158
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,340
is this normal?

159
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,190
Please be rest assured.

160
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,190
Shi Lan Ke School and Martial Soul Hall

161
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:08,990
have no relation.

162
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,500
It's the same with other powers.

163
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,310
As for this admission test,

164
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,710
besides Hu Lie Na,

165
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,910
there's also a girl

166
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,030
who came with a purpose.

167
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,340
Dai Mu Bai

168
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,220
is tall, composed like a nobleman

169
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,100
and he has strong strength.

170
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,780
He's popular in Suo Tuo City.

171
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,260
It has nothing to be surprised that

172
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,030
many girls go after him.

173
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,100
It's good to be young.

174
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,540
As for the older men,
they have only their speeches.

175
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,540
Don't judge the book

176
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,910
by its cover.

177
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,540
So?

178
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,150
You should have rejected those from
Martial Soul Hall to stay here.

179
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,310
I only take her as an observer.

180
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,150
Don't worry.

181
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:45,910
Besides,

182
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,630
she has helped the school a lot.

183
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,710
Her identity in Martial Soul Hall
is vague.

184
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,820
This happens to Tang San too.

185
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,590
But the school couldn't reject
any students

186
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,540
for this reason.

187
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:01,910
I'll stay.

188
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,060
In Shi Lan Ke School?

189
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,470
Don't you need a teacher?

190
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,820
My school is very poor.

191
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,150
I can do it for free.

192
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,660
I don't take advantage of others.

193
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,710
Do you want me to beg you?

194
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,780
You're doing this for the sake
of Tang San?

195
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,750
I need to observe the girl.

196
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,990
Make sure that

197
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,340
she won't lead trouble to Tang San.

198
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,470
I've never seen you

199
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,750
care about someone like this.

200
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,540
It never happens before.

201
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,660
He had kowtowed to me

202
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,380
and acknowledged me as his teacher.

203
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,470
I have to be responsible for him.

204
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,430
Besides, I've promised his father

205
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,540
to take care of him.

206
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,470
His father?

207
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,540
Who is it?

208
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:38,910
It's fine.

209
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,310
It's good to keep away

210
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,190
from secrets.

211
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,710
As long as you promise
to teach for free,

212
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,140
I won't ask anymore.

213
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,540
Didn't you say that

214
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,830
you don't take advantage of others?

215
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,700
You're not like others.

216
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,580
Sit down.

217
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,510
Drink some water.

218
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,580
How is it?

219
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,510
How many Soul Rings have you obtained
all these years?

220
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:06,870
I still remain at two.

221
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,270
That's impossible.

222
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,950
The fist I hit on you just now

223
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:10,750
was a test.

224
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,580
Yet it's tough.

225
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,900
You can't take it with Double Soul Rings.

226
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,540
Are you still studying
the Martial Soul Theory?

227
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,750
Operation means to enhance strength,

228
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,510
the most suitable environment
to cultivate Soul Power...

229
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,430
It looks boring.

230
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,070
Everyone is here?

231
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,540
Let me introduce a new teacher to you.

232
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,870
This is my bosom friend of many years.

233
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,020
He is also the master of
the Martial Soul Theory.

234
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,340
You can call him...

235
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,830
Call me Master.

236
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,190
From now onwards,

237
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,460
Master will be teaching you all

238
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,540
the Martial Soul Theory.

239
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,540
I hope that you could learn from him.

240
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,070
Don't disgrace our school.

241
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,390
Yes.

242
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,990
We have a new observer this year.

243
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,780
Introduce yourself.

244
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,430
Hello, I'm Hu Lie Na.

245
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,990
I'm from Martial Soul Hall.

246
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,580
Well.

247
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,540
That's all for the introduction.

248
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,950
Our admission has officially
accomplished.

249
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,700
Go and prepare yourself.

250
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,430
Our class will start tomorrow.

251
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:18,460
Please come in.

252
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,070
Hurry up.

253
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:19,900
Hurry up.

254
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,430
This is the male dorm.

255
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,460
Brother Dai's bed.

256
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,430
And this is mine.

257
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:27,830
Choose your bed from the rest.

258
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,270
By the way, where does Wu live?

259
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,630
Girls dorm is beside here.

260
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,870
But the school stipulates that

261
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,700
male students are not allowed
to disturb female students.

262
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,540
Got it. I'll sleep here.

263
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,540
Sure.

264
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:39,900
Besides,

265
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,340
I really can't believe that

266
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,390
Headmaster has

267
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,630
such a handsome and charming friend.

268
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,140
Our Headmaster is so stingy.

269
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,140
I've never seen

270
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,220
any of his friends since I was young.

271
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,140
Since you were young?

272
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,190
He is my foster father.

273
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,430
Back then, he would fly me to the sky

274
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,700
during my birthday.

275
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,580
He would bring me everywhere
I wanted to go

276
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,660
and show me the world.

277
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,070
Since then,

278
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,270
I've decided

279
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,630
to bring him to any places
he wants to go

280
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,270
when I have the strength.

281
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,750
However, when my Martial Soul awakened,

282
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,990
I realized that we have
different Martial Souls.

283
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,100
And then I knew that he fostered me.

284
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,430
What's your Martial Soul?

285
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,390
Can you fly too?

286
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,780
My...

287
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,660
It sure can fly

288
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,580
with the wings of imagination.

289
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,070
Am I right?

290
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,460
Forget about Headmaster.

291
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,310
Let's talk about Master.

292
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,220
How many Soul Rings does he possess?

293
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,510
Seven or eight?

294
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,540
Does he have nine instead?

295
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,950
Does this really matter?

296
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,830
Of course.

297
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,830
Our Headmaster is the Soul Saint
with seven Soul Rings.

298
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,780
How about Master?

299
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,750
He only has two Soul Rings.

300
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:36,900
What?

301
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:38,950
Two Soul Rings?

302
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,020
Asking a Soul Master with two Soul Rings
to teach us?

303
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,700
What's wrong with Headmaster?

304
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,580
Numbers of Soul Ring

305
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,070
couldn't decide one's strength.

306
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,580
If that's the case,

307
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,700
tell me then.

308
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,460
What could decide one's strength?

309
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,270
The theory teacher is studying

310
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,580
is the most powerful one
on Douluo Continent.

311
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,340
So, were those tricks you used to fight
with Mr. Zhao

312
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,430
also taught by him?

313
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,220
No.

314
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,270
What did he teach then?

315
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,830
Theory.

316
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,460
Theory?

317
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,220
The reason I came to Shi Lan Ke School

318
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,780
is to learn to become stronger,

319
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,100
not for theory study.

320
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,190
In my opinion,

321
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,780
it's not enough for one
to merely have power.

322
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,220
Without the support of theories,

323
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,020
he will never become

324
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,220
a powerful Soul Master.

325
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,140
Who are you referring to?

326
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:14,900
Tang San.

327
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,700
Sir?

328
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,460
Master...

329
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,310
Come out.

330
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,660
Old Hei, let me do it.

331
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:30,700
Thank you.

332
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:31,900
Thank you.

333
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:36,750
Brother Dai,

334
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,830
why do you have beef with Tang San?

335
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:39,830
I don't.

336
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,750
Let me put it in this way.

337
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,540
Why don't you like Tang San?

338
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,510
He is smart.

339
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,540
But at the wrong place.

340
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,100
You're referring

341
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,430
to those tricks he used

342
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,430
when confronted with Mr. Zhao?

343
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,830
Not only that.

344
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,540
After he has won over Mr. Zhao,

345
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,950
there was black smoke emerging from him.

346
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,430
Didn't you find it strange?

347
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,540
No.

348
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,750
As long as he won, right?

349
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,340
But I don't want my partner

350
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,340
to win the fight

351
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,190
with heretic means.

352
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,020
I think Tang San is quite nice though.

353
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,900
Last time, he saved me
with all his might

354
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,780
when I was about to die.

355
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,750
I can see he's righteous.

356
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,190
You're so naive.

357
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,830
How could you trust him
with small favours?

358
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:17,990
Tang San

359
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,070
has so many things that
I can't see through.

360
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,700
Well, time will tell.

361
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,750
You'll understand him later.

362
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,140
Brother,

363
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,870
our class starts tomorrow.

364
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,220
Do you want to hang around in the city?

365
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,460
I'm not going. Go yourself.

366
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,750
Let's go.

367
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,070
Stop working.

368
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,340
Let's go together.

369
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,630
Don't isolate yourself.

370
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,390
Go with me.

371
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,220
Let's hang out.

372
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:38,830
Let's go.

373
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,700
Stop being angry.

374
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,390
Go.

375
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,220
Tang San?

376
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:56,900
Tang San.

377
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,950
I've no idea that you know this.

378
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:00,870
My dad taught me.

379
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,750
He said this can help with my stamina.

380
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,390
When I was in Nuoding School,

381
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,070
I used to forge iron to make a living.

382
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,990
Brother Dai...

383
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,660
Tang San, are you sure
you want to work here?

384
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,580
Don't worry, Sir.

385
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,660
I've thought it over.

386
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,460
I could train my stamina
with forging the iron.

387
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,780
It won't affect my study.

388
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:21,870
Well.

389
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,190
But, once I found that

390
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,220
you're lagging behind,

391
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,780
I won't allow you to do this again.

392
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,340
Sure.

393
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,700
Old granny, what are you doing?

394
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,990
Eighty Gold Soul Coins are big bucks.

395
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,700
I can't owe you this.

396
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,220
There is a famine in the village.

397
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,100
If it wasn't you who helped us,

398
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,990
perhaps we would die of hunger.

399
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,070
Your favour is too big for us.

400
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,870
Don't thank me.

401
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,510
It's just a small deal. I mean it.

402
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,580
We'll find all means
to return the money to you.

403
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,270
You don't have
to return the money though.

404
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,390
Don't mention it again.

405
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,140
No way.

406
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,100
This food is enough.

407
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,190
We'll definitely find ways

408
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,070
to repay you.

409
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,100
I've never thought that

410
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,830
he used the admission fee

411
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,340
to help the needy.

412
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,100
One of
the Ten Core Competing Power of Martial Soul

413
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,700
that I've researched and proposed

414
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,660
is the Theory of Martial Soul Mimicry.

415
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,900
Soul Master with Plant Branch Martial Soul

416
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,580
is not necessary to absorb

417
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,070
Soul Ring from
Plant Branch Soul Beast.

418
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,540
As for those with Beast Soul...

Under certain conditions,

421
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,100
both of them can combine.

422
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,100
Theoretically,

423
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,270
the more the Soul Ring,
the stronger the strength.

424
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,340
It's said that the possessor
of ten Soul Rings

425
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:02,950
will become an immortal.

426
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:08,780
Headmaster.

427
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,460
You're back?

428
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,070
What have you learnt

429
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,990
in these days?

430
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,460
Master taught us about

431
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,020
Ten Core Competing Powers
of Martial Soul.

432
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,580
What are they?

433
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,190
Firstly...

434
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,990
Tell me, Dai Mu Bai.

435
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,580
Say whatever you could recall.

436
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,900
What? You can't remember any of them?

437
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,140
It's impossible to win over rivals

438
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,340
with theory.

439
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,510
Without the conclusion of
pioneers' experience,

440
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,630
perhaps you won't even know

441
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,310
what does Martial Soul mean.

442
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,660
Anyhow, I don't believe in

443
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,020
those theories that haven't been proven.

444
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,750
His theories have been proven.

445
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,630
My Martial Soul is Blue Silver Plant.

446
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,220
Yet I'm able to absorb

447
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,340
the Soul Ring of Thorn Apple Snake.

448
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,990
This is the so-called
Theory of Martial Soul Mimicry.

449
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:56,990
I would rather believe that

450
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,750
only through hard training

451
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,020
can truly improve myself.

452
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,070
As for the mimicry theory or something,

453
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,430
just let those who need it to learn.

454
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,950
You all may go back.

455
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,020
Headmaster...

456
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,070
Dai...

457
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,420
Don't force him
if he doesn't want to learn.

458
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,060
Everyone has their own choice.

459
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,820
Dai Mu Bai

460
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,340
is too arrogant and confident.

461
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,150
It won't benefit him
if he still behaves like this.

462
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,460
It's because my level is too low.

463
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:37,670
That's normal for him not to follow me.

464
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,910
I can't let his bad behaviour
goes unchecked.

465
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,270
I've received news just now.

466
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,580
Perhaps this might be an opportunity.

467
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,750
What is it?

468
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,060
Headmaster,

469
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,550
today is our rest day.

470
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,510
Why do you call for us

471
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,550
in this early morning?

472
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,220
Well.

473
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,220
Yesterday,

474
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,990
there was a businessman
who came to seek help.

475
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:12,940
According to him,

476
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,700
when he was on his way to do business,

477
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,870
he passed by a village.

478
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,270
And he found something strange

479
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,940
happened in the village.

480
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,390
He claimed that
if this can't be settled,

481
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,910
he'll never dare
to take that path again.

482
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,910
Therefore, he entrusted us

483
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,910
to do the investigation.

484
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,060
How much money do you collect from him?

485
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,390
This is not about the monetary matter.

486
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,670
As a Soul Master,

487
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,510
we're responsible to provide help

488
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,270
for those villagers.

489
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,700
You must bear it in your mind.

490
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,150
You're right.

491
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,580
Let's set off now

492
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,940
and try to reach the village
before lunch.

493
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,550
Let's go.

494
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:44,220
Let's go.

495
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,670
Tang San, how far is it to go?

496
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,550
I'm exhausted.

497
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,030
It seems it may take some more time.

498
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,100
Do you want me to carry you?

499
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:55,670
Sure.

500
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,220
Up.

501
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,550
What's wrong? You don't want it?

502
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,180
It's fine. No need.

503
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,220
Tang San.

504
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,910
Did Master tell you anything before?

505
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,030
Nope.

506
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,670
I was planning to go working
this afternoon.

507
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,670
Yet I can't go now.

508
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,340
Working?

509
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,750
I forge iron to make a living.

510
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,910
Brother Dai and I saw you that day.

511
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,510
Ou Si Ke,

512
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,580
did Headmaster

513
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,750
always accept

514
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,910
this kind of task to help others with chores?

515
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,340
Not always.

516
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,670
But, Headmaster did mention that

517
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,510
we have to grow from the battle.

518
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,820
What is our battle?

519
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,790
Our battle is

520
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,910
to help others to do cleaning chores.

521
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,820
I couldn't know
what he's thinking about.

522
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,060
Is this task

523
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,940
part of the battle?

524
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,700
I've no idea.

525
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,510
Maybe this is a mysterious course.

526
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,510
Did this happen before?

527
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,870
Shi Lan Ke School

528
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,700
doesn't have fixed schedules.

529
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,150
We'll learn

530
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:51,790
whatever Headmaster teaches us.

531
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,910
It may seem somewhat random.

532
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,580
But the outcome is extremely useful.

533
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,150
This must be the wisdom of Headmaster.

534
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,390
You seem to admire Headmaster a lot.

535
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,270
Of course.

536
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,790
Headmaster is the one who raised me

537
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:06,910
and teach me how to use Martial Soul.

538
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,630
Although he's kind of stingy,

539
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,820
however, he's doing it for the sake
of the school.

540
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:12,670
In this world,

541
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,060
Headmaster

542
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,390
is the one I most admire.

543
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:20,510
I can understand you.

544
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,630
I have a great teacher too.

545
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,100
If it wasn't him,

546
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,870
I would die

547
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,060
in the hands of Xiao Chen Yu.

548
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,150
Tang San,

549
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:31,940
according to the theory of drama,

550
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,150
both of us have similar backgrounds.

551
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,300
I don't think our background

552
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,580
is similar though.

553
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,300
We must be under the same concept.

554
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,060
I don't think so.

555
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,700
You've given me this.

556
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,990
It's a token of our friendship.

557
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,060
- Don't.
- Token of friendship.

558
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,460
Please don't.

559
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,510
This is just a gift,

560
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:51,390
nothing special.

561
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:53,390
Tang San.

562
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:54,940
As long as you're in school,

563
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,180
I have your back.

564
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,390
Why haven't we reached yet?

565
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,270
Everyone,

566
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,220
when we were in school just now,

567
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,550
I've told you

568
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,150
the village ahead of us

569
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,670
has something strange happened.

570
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:27,910
What is that?

571
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,300
You may have to investigate

572
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,580
the actual situation.

573
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,220
Find your own answer.

574
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,870
This is the first collaboration
you have.

575
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,670
Hopefully, you could trust each other.

576
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,910
Take note of this,

577
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,180
this is also counted as your exam.

578
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,300
The consequence

579
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,030
will impact your results.

580
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,670
Walk till the end,

581
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:50,750
you'll reach the village.

582
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,510
Aren't you going with us?

583
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,270
This is your task.

584
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,390
Accomplish with your own force.

585
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,150
Sure.

586
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,340
Let's go.

587
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,180
Okay.

588
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,510
Let's go.

589
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,940
The observer is not necessary to join.

590
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,300
I'm willing to be an observer too.

591
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,030
Sure.

592
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,990
I'll burn all your things then.

593
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,510
Headmaster is right.

594
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,340
We must grow from the battle.

595
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,630
I have to grow.

596
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,700
I have to fight.

597
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,390
Wait for me.

598
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:23,870
I'm willing to go with them.

599
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,420
Mark my words,

600
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,910
you're just an observer.

601
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,670
I know.

602
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,820
I won't trouble them.

603
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,340
Are you really letting them handle all?

604
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,390
You've started to worry about them?

605
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,150
Until now,

606
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,580
I haven't taken in anything.

607
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,670
How am I going to investigate?

608
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,150
Just hang in there.

609
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:05,700
After entering the village,

610
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,550
follow my instruction.

611
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,910
Why?

612
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,300
Our team will be scattered

613
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,510
without one's instruction?

614
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,580
I mean why should I listen to you?

615
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:16,940
Because I'm the strongest.

616
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,420
Is it the cocky guy the strongest one?

617
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,580
You can leave if you don't want to.

618
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,220
I'm also part of Shi Lan Ke,

619
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,270
why should I listen to you?

620
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,340
You're eligible only if you defeat me.

621
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,870
Calm down, please.

622
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,820
Aren't we have to trust each other?

623
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,300
Why do you start quarreling now?

624
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,060
What happened?

625
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:30,910
A small gift for you.

626
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,630
Calm down.

627
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,270
Brother Dai.

628
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,100
Let's move.

629
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,060
What's wrong?

630
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,870
Do you find that

631
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,790
there is lots of chickens
in this village?

632
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:09,870
Anything wrong?

633
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,300
I used to live in the village back then.

634
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,790
Villagers will keep some

635
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,220
chickens and ducks

636
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,940
and also dogs.

637
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,820
But, there are only chickens
in Nightfire Village.

638
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:21,910
This...

639
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,910
Does it matter?

640
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:24,820
I don't think it's strange.

641
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,460
I mean...

642
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,700
Look at the ground.

643
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,270
It's too clean.

644
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,390
So what?

645
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,180
Perhaps it's nothing.

646
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:34,270
Let's go.

647
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:35,550
Wu.

648
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,630
This cottage

649
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,100
looks like it has been burnt.

650
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,150
It is all burnt.

651
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,340
Did anyone try to put out the fire?

652
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,820
That's strange.

653
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,630
Look.

654
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,100
The grass around the cottage
remains green.

655
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,510
Yet the cottage is burnt.

656
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,100
It seems like the fire

657
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,220
was blocked inside the cottage

658
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,180
by something.

659
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,460
Therefore, it didn't spread.

660
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,180
If your words are true,

661
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,670
this is fishy.

662
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,510
Brother Dai, what's the situation now?

663
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,030
Let's go and find
the village head first.

664
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,100
I have a sense of impending doom.

665
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:27,940
Why?

666
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,150
I can't tell.

667
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:32,820
Don't worry.

668
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:33,940
As long as I'm here,

669
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,510
I'll protect you well.

670
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,420
Let's go.

671
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,420
Come.

672
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:12,340
Let me do it, sir.

673
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,580
Seek help?

674
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,100
No.

675
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,670
But we've received a distress message

676
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,300
from Nightfire Village.

677
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:20,990
It's from a businessman who passed by.

678
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,300
He said that in the night,

679
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,390
the village was caught in a big fire.

680
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:24,910
And there was a black monster

681
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,940
leaped up from the fire

682
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,060
and rushed straight to the village.

683
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,630
I see.

684
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,220
It was just

685
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,420
a normal house fire.

686
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:35,750
I reckon

687
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,990
the businessman

688
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,060
might not understand what has happened.

689
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,820
And makes you come here.

690
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:43,030
Well.

691
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,670
I'll treat you to a meal tonight

692
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,340
as my apologies.

693
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,670
I'm sorry

694
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,870
to trouble you all.

695
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:50,390
Sir,

696
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,790
how about the black monster?

697
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,180
Don't say it.

698
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,750
Nightfire Village

699
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,060
has been standing here for hundred years

700
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,100
calmly,

701
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,390
silently

702
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,550
and steadily.

703
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,580
How could it be a monster here?

704
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,180
Sir,

705
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,150
perhaps you don't know about this?

706
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,580
What do you mean?

707
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,910
I'm the head of this village.

708
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,060
I should know everything.

709
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,420
You're right though.

710
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,390
Sir,

711
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,340
the burnt house you said,

712
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,910
is it located at the entrance there?

713
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:22,940
Yes.

714
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:26,990
Sir,

715
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,910
when did it happen?

716
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:29,870
A few days ago.

717
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,420
Were you there?

718
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,220
I...

719
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,390
I was sleeping at that time.

720
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,390
When I reached there,

721
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,870
the fire has been put out.

722
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,580
Did you realize that

723
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,550
only one cottage was burnt in that area,

724
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,100
and the plants around it
remain in good shape?

725
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,100
It's just like...

726
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,180
Just like there's something

727
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,030
in the cottage

728
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,340
blocking the fire

729
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,420
from spreading out.

730
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,820
Your imagination is kind of rich.

731
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,180
That was because the villagers

732
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,340
put out the fire in time.

733
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,630
Why do you

734
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:06,790
have so many questions?

735
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:08,220
Sir...

736
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,300
Sir,

737
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,270
I think

738
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,220
the businessman must have

739
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:13,750
seen it wrong.

740
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,700
He must be regarding the villagers
who try to put out the fire

741
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,030
as the black monster.

742
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:17,990
Think about it.

743
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,220
In the windy and pitch-black night,

744
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,270
the fire was raging.

745
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,580
It must have stretched the shadow.

746
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,270
This must be a misunderstanding.

747
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,940
I think that

748
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,060
your words do make sense.

749
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,460
I'll take this as an idea

750
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,750
to write my story.

751
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,510
Your analysis makes sense.

752
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,580
That's that truth.

753
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:33,790
But, sir...

754
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:34,550
But, sir.

755
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,990
We came all the way from our school

756
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,750
because of the distress message.

757
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,460
It's hard for us

758
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,580
to go back empty-handed.

759
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,150
He's right, sir.

760
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,630
We can't explain to our Headmaster.

761
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,460
Well...

762
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:51,630
Sir...

763
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:52,870
It's fine.

764
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:53,510
I'm fine.

765
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,180
I...

766
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,100
I don't want to drink anymore.

767
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,990
I know you're kind, right?

768
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,790
You're caring about Nightfire Village.

769
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:00,510
Well.

770
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,580
I'll still treat you to a meal tonight.

771
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,670
Besides, I'll give all of you

772
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,580
one Gold Soul Coin each.

773
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:08,270
That's great.

774
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,670
Thank you, sir.

775
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,700
A reward for helping.

776
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,270
Sure.

777
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,510
Tang San, what do you mean?

778
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,420
Headmaster asked us to come
for investigation,

779
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:17,670
not for cheating money.

780
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,940
I didn't say I quit.

781
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,340
Why did you stop me just now?

782
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,300
Didn't you see that

783
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,030
the village head doesn't want us
to investigate?

784
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,420
If you keep on asking him,

785
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,820
he'll get annoyed

786
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:29,820
and hinders us from investigating.

787
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,750
That's why you purposely said that
you want to quit investigating.

788
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,670
Let them loose their guard first.

789
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,820
We'll go to other places
to investigate.

790
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,820
This village is indeed strange.

791
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,510
Brother, drink some water.

792
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:42,910
Tang San, you're smart.

793
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,300
But without the help of
the village head,

794
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,700
how are we going to investigate?

795
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,340
The village is big,

796
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,550
there must be other clues.

797
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,580
We still have time before night falls.

798
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,420
Let's look for

799
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,790
villagers who are willing to help.

800
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,030
Sure.

801
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:58,820
Okay.

802
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,030
You all go yourself.
I don't want to join.

803
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:02,790
Whatever.

804
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:03,870
Set off now.

805
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,030
Let's gather before the sky turns dark.

806
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:05,630
Sure.

807
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:06,340
Let's go.

808
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,820
Afterwards, I hope that

809
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:13,940
you could discuss with me

810
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,630
in advance.

811
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,990
Because I'm the Leader of the team.

812
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,150
Brother Dai,

813
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,580
sometimes it's impossible

814
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,460
to discuss in advance.

815
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,180
We should refine the plan then.

816
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,030
If you always do things
without informing,

817
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,420
the situation will be beyond control.

818
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,300
You've witnessed the situation then.

819
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,270
I don't have...

820
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,460
Stop explaining.

821
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:29,750
Go now.

822
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:33,790
No need.

823
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,700
I've got it.

824
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:42,550
Sir,

825
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,180
during the fire that night,

826
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:46,700
you were there.

827
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,580
Why did you lie to us?

828
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,340
I've no idea what you're saying.

829
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,460
The villagers told us

830
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,220
the monster is in the village.

831
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,910
They want us to help too.

832
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:01,940
Who said this?

833
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,580
Tell me.

834
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:04,940
I want to speak to the person.

835
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,100
It's not important.

836
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:07,420
Sir,

837
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,390
tell us now.

838
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,060
What was the black image,

839
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,060
which is neither a Soul Beast

840
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,270
nor a beast,

841
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,550
appeared that night?

842
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,180
Sir,

843
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,910
Only if you tell us the truth

844
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,180
can we help you.

845
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,100
That's right.

846
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:26,510
All right.

847
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,550
That night,

848
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,220
I was there

849
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,390
and

850
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,420
I've witnessed

851
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,220
a black figure

852
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,940
leaped up from the house

853
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,060
and rushed out.

854
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,220
Red eyes in the smoke?

855
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,550
Perhaps it was the blaze.

856
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,030
Why didn't you investigate it?

857
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,390
Villages

858
00:31:59,150 --> 00:31:59,910
are dry places.

859
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,100
It's normal for it to catch fire.

860
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,270
Besides, after that night,

861
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,580
nothing strange had happened.

862
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:10,910
Furthermore,

863
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,940
if I find someone to investigate,

864
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,670
it will not only consume manpower
and resources

865
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,870
but also cost me a lot of money.

866
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,390
You're right.

867
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,390
Sir,

868
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:25,820
do you think that

869
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,220
we're cheating your money?

870
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:30,790
Isn't that true?

871
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:38,300
Sir,

872
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,180
we're here to help you.

873
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:41,700
If we can't find the culprit,

874
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,300
we won't take a single cent from you.

875
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:48,910
Sir,

876
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,180
are there any survivors

877
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,100
from the affected family?

878
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:51,820
Yes.

879
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,220
It's a kid.

880
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,670
Ma Hong Jun.

881
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,030
Ma Hong Jun?

882
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,700
Where is he now?

883
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,060
He must have suffered a lot

884
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,550
from this accident.

885
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,670
Don't further traumatize him.

886
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,700
Tell me, where is he now?

887
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,550
I...

888
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,390
I've no idea.

889
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,390
Since the accident,

890
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,750
he became weird

891
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,630
and refuse to meet people.

892
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,220
I haven't seen him for days.

893
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,030
How old is he?

894
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,150
Around 15 years old.

895
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,580
How does he look like?

896
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,300
He has a round face and he's short.

897
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,670
He looks adorable too.

898
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,670
Everyone got it now?

899
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,340
Let's spread up to look for Ma Hong Jun.

900
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,270
Bring him back once you find him.

901
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:36,870
For those timid ones, just stay here.

902
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:44,870
Sir,

903
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,340
how many chickens are there
in the village?

904
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:49,510
Chickens?

905
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,270
I've no idea.

906
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:52,870
Well...

907
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:54,420
We have many

908
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,510
chickens, chicks,

909
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:56,940
roosters and hens here.

910
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:59,180
Were there any casualties in that fire?

911
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:00,340
Yes.

912
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,220
Ma Hong Jun's father died in the fire.

913
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:04,700
Has he been buried yet?

914
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:05,870
Yes.

915
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,910
At the west of the village.

916
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,060
Thank you.

917
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,220
Thank you.

918
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:14,460
Tang San.

919
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:15,550
Tang San.

920
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,670
Hold on.

921
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,510
Why did you ask about the chickens?

922
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,030
I'm thinking that

923
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,990
will Ma Hong Jun go to the grave

924
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,140
as he misses his father?

925
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,660
That makes sense.

926
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:27,750
Go and check it out.

927
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:28,660
I'll wait for you here.

928
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,380
You're not going with us?

929
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,380
Yes.

930
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,550
I would rather spend my time

931
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,460
writing new scripts.

932
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:37,990
I don't find it interesting

933
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,310
being a Soul Master.

934
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,350
Only art.

935
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,180
Only art

936
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,830
could be immortal.

937
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:51,620
Why do you

938
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,750
still stay in Shi Lan Ke School?

939
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:56,940
I come

940
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,590
to collect ideas for creation.

941
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,750
Let's take you as an example.

942
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,460
Both of you are good materials for me.

943
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,550
Us?

944
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,070
Yes.

945
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:03,830
For example, you.

946
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,550
You're pretty and adorable.

947
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:06,940
Why do you come to Shi Lan Ke School?

948
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,940
Why do you choose
to become a Soul Master

949
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,860
regardless of challenges?

950
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:11,790
What's your reason?

951
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,180
All of these are the contradiction
and conflicts in drama.

952
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:14,860
Do you know that?

953
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,660
I want to find out
the nature of Martial Soul.

954
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,550
Nature?

955
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,550
That's so profound.

956
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,110
I want to venture into a new path.

957
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:22,830
What path is that?

958
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,900
I want to find out

959
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,620
could Soul Master obtain Soul Ring

960
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,660
without hunting for Soul Beast?

961
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,270
This...

962
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:30,860
might be hard.

963
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,380
Over the past thousands of years,

964
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,550
all Soul Masters get upgraded level

965
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,310
through Soul Beast hunting.

966
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,750
But I want to try.

967
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:38,510
I'll accompany you.

968
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:39,700
Both of you

969
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,550
can go now.
