<i>Episode 9</i>

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,890
When does Shi Lan Ke School

16
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,850
have something to do

17
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,680
with Martial Soul Hall?

18
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,040
Shi Lan Ke School

19
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,970
has no relation with them at all.

20
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,610
Is Su Yun Tao from
Martial Soul Hall there too?

21
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,320
Is he the one you want to meet?

22
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:01,760
Yes.

23
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,800
Yesterday, I stalked him.

24
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:04,570
I saw him

25
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:05,890
entered the City Main Office
of Suo Tuo City.

26
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,000
And now the city

27
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,970
is full of this notice.

28
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,570
They have admitted

29
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,440
Shi Lan Ke School's
teaching qualification?

30
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,850
Really?

31
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:21,490
I heard that Governor

32
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,320
always wants to dominate
Shi Lan Ke School.

33
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,120
However, your Headmaster rejected it.

34
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,090
That's true.

35
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,520
Governor decided

36
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,490
to target the school,

37
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,730
but he changed his mind suddenly.

38
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,010
And now the officer of
Martial Soul Hall appears.

39
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:35,930
This means that

40
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,240
Governor is oppressed by
Martial Soul Hall.

41
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,450
That's why he has to admit
the status of the school.

42
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,810
But Su Yun Tao is just an officer.

43
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,650
Is he able to influence
Governor's decision?

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,520
He is the direct disciple

45
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,240
of the chief of Martial Soul Hall.

46
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,210
His identity is prestigious.

47
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,450
The chief of Martial Soul Hall?

48
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,120
The invincible of Douluo Continent?

49
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,210
Why does he approach Headmaster?

50
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,490
Our Headmaster

51
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,810
is poor and ugly.

52
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:57,960
What's his intention then?

53
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,320
Are Su Yun Tao and Hu Lie Na

54
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,210
still in school?

55
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,520
When we went out just now,

56
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,400
Su Yun Tao has left.

57
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,650
Perhaps Hu Lie Na still stays.

58
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,320
I'm still worried.

59
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,520
Bring me to the school.

60
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,400
I want to see your Headmaster.

61
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,120
Sure.

62
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:15,850
Master,

63
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,320
it's okay for you
to meet with Headmaster.

64
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,520
However, his behaviour

65
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,490
is quite strange.

66
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:20,960
You have to get prepared.

67
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,730
Headmaster.

68
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,160
Someone is here to see you.

69
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,320
I've been looking for you
over the years,

70
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,010
yet I couldn't find you.

71
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,760
Where have you been?

72
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,240
Why are you looking for me?

73
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,160
To return me the money?

74
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,450
Regarding this matter,

75
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,040
don't say in front of them.

76
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,520
Gang.

77
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,930
Gang?

78
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,570
Since Golden Iron Triangle
has disbanded,

79
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,680
where have you been?

80
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,240
I was in Nuoding School,

81
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,850
working as a guest teacher
without any contribution.

82
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,210
But for this time,

83
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,720
I come here to send my disciple Tang San

84
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,600
and his sister, Wu for admission.

85
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,210
Is Tang San your disciple?

86
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,210
Why are you willing to send him here?

87
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,000
Because I have trust in you.

88
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,000
These two kids are talented.

89
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,530
Why didn't you inform me

90
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,000
before sending them here?

91
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:43,880
I hope that

92
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,210
they could enter into this school
with their ability.

93
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,810
You seem to have great confidence
in them.

94
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:50,810
Brother,

95
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,410
I have something to tell you.

96
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,280
Well.

97
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,600
Come to my place.

98
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,210
You all go and look for

99
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,370
those villagers

100
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
who need to do house maintenance

101
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,250
and help them out.

102
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,410
Remember to collect cash
when you finish that.

103
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,650
Issue a receipt
if they don't have cash.

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

105
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,000
Gang, come.

106
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,930
I've missed you so much.

107
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:08,880
Let's go.

108
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:09,760
Come.

109
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,090
Gang?

110
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,970
Come, Gang.

111
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,530
Please come in.

112
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,490
This is where I live.

113
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:18,840
It looks kind of shabby,

114
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:19,930
but it's a lovely place.

115
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:20,840
Welcome in.

116
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,210
Sure.

117
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:21,600
Here.

118
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,760
Have a seat.

119
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,000
Thank you, brother.

120
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,840
Have a seat.

121
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,690
I heard that you insisted
to run the school by yourself.

122
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,760
You only accept kids
that pass your test.

123
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,040
And they have become

124
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,130
great Soul Masters.

125
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,000
I do my best to teach them.

126
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,720
However, it's hard to keep
the school going.

127
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,560
I have to rely on the village
for the school

128
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,090
and help them with cleaning jobs

129
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,560
to square away teaching funds.

130
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,280
I can see that

131
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,690
they are the last batch of the school.

132
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,410
Well, stop complaining that you're poor.

133
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,370
To be honest, I'm somehow
envious of you.

134
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,210
Envious of your free life

135
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,090
and establishing an independent school.

136
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,760
Envious of me?

137
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,970
Stay here then.

138
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,040
Tang San and Wu wants to go to the city.

139
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,840
They are waiting for me.

140
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,560
I'll leave now.

141
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,000
Little brat.

142
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,650
What happened?

143
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:35,410
Ou Si Ke.

144
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,130
Get out of here. Don't eavesdrop.

145
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,210
Don't be angry.

146
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,090
I just want to reconfirm

147
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,720
the relationship between your school
and Martial Soul Hall.

148
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:45,880
You're asking about

149
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,720
the new girl from Martial Soul Hall,
right?

150
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,760
She came here for Dai Mu Bai.

151
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,560
Su Yun Tao brought her here.

152
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,090
He is the one who has awoken Tang San's
Martial Soul.

153
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,280
I heard that he is

154
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,600
the disciple of Bi Bi Dong,

155
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,930
the chief of Martial Soul Hall.

156
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,650
Sending a girl to Shi Lan Ke School

157
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,760
by himself,

158
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:03,840
is this normal?

159
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,690
Please be rest assured.

160
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,690
Shi Lan Ke School and Martial Soul Hall

161
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:08,490
have no relation.

162
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,000
It's the same with other powers.

163
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,810
As for this admission test,

164
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,210
besides Hu Lie Na,

165
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,410
there's also a girl

166
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,530
who came with a purpose.

167
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,840
Dai Mu Bai

168
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,720
is tall, composed like a nobleman

169
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,600
and he has strong strength.

170
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,280
He's popular in Suo Tuo City.

171
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,760
It has nothing to be surprised that

172
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,530
many girls go after him.

173
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,600
It's good to be young.

174
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,040
As for the older men,
they have only their speeches.

175
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,040
Don't judge the book

176
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,410
by its cover.

177
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,040
So?

178
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,650
You should have rejected those from
Martial Soul Hall to stay here.

179
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,810
I only take her as an observer.

180
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,650
Don't worry.

181
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,410
Besides,

182
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,130
she has helped the school a lot.

183
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,210
Her identity in Martial Soul Hall
is vague.

184
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,320
This happens to Tang San too.

185
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,090
But the school couldn't reject
any students

186
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,040
for this reason.

187
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,410
I'll stay.

188
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,560
In Shi Lan Ke School?

189
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,970
Don't you need a teacher?

190
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,320
My school is very poor.

191
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,650
I can do it for free.

192
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,160
I don't take advantage of others.

193
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,210
Do you want me to beg you?

194
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,280
You're doing this for the sake
of Tang San?

195
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,250
I need to observe the girl.

196
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,490
Make sure that

197
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,840
she won't lead trouble to Tang San.

198
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,970
I've never seen you

199
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,250
care about someone like this.

200
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,040
It never happens before.

201
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,160
He had kowtowed to me

202
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,880
and acknowledged me as his teacher.

203
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,970
I have to be responsible for him.

204
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,930
Besides, I've promised his father

205
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,040
to take care of him.

206
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:33,970
His father?

207
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,040
Who is it?

208
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,410
It's fine.

209
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:40,810
It's good to keep away

210
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:41,690
from secrets.

211
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,210
As long as you promise
to teach for free,

212
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,640
I won't ask anymore.

213
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,040
Didn't you say that

214
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,330
you don't take advantage of others?

215
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,200
You're not like others.

216
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,080
Sit down.

217
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,010
Drink some water.

218
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,080
How is it?

219
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,010
How many Soul Rings have you obtained
all these years?

220
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,370
I still remain at two.

221
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,770
That's impossible.

222
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,450
The fist I hit on you just now

223
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,250
was a test.

224
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,080
Yet it's tough.

225
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,400
You can't take it with Double Soul Rings.

226
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,040
Are you still studying
the Martial Soul Theory?

227
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,250
Operation means to enhance strength,

228
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,010
the most suitable environment
to cultivate Soul Power...

229
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,930
It looks boring.

230
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,570
Everyone is here?

231
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,040
Let me introduce a new teacher to you.

232
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,370
This is my bosom friend of many years.

233
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,520
He is also the master of
the Martial Soul Theory.

234
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,840
You can call him...

235
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,330
Call me Master.

236
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,690
From now onwards,

237
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,960
Master will be teaching you all

238
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,040
the Martial Soul Theory.

239
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,040
I hope that you could learn from him.

240
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,570
Don't disgrace our school.

241
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:56,890
Yes.

242
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,490
We have a new observer this year.

243
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,280
Introduce yourself.

244
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,930
Hello, I'm Hu Lie Na.

245
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,490
I'm from Martial Soul Hall.

246
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,080
Well.

247
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,040
That's all for the introduction.

248
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,450
Our admission has officially
accomplished.

249
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,200
Go and prepare yourself.

250
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,930
Our class will start tomorrow.

251
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:17,960
Please come in.

252
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,570
Hurry up.

253
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:19,400
Hurry up.

254
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:20,930
This is the male dorm.

255
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,960
Brother Dai's bed.

256
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:22,930
And this is mine.

257
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,330
Choose your bed from the rest.

258
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,770
By the way, where does Wu live?

259
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,130
Girls dorm is beside here.

260
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,370
But the school stipulates that

261
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,200
male students are not allowed
to disturb female students.

262
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,040
Got it. I'll sleep here.

263
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,040
Sure.

264
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:39,400
Besides,

265
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,840
I really can't believe that

266
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,890
Headmaster has

267
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,130
such a handsome and charming friend.

268
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,640
Our Headmaster is so stingy.

269
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:45,640
I've never seen

270
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,720
any of his friends since I was young.

271
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,640
Since you were young?

272
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,690
He is my foster father.

273
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,930
Back then, he would fly me to the sky

274
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,200
during my birthday.

275
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,080
He would bring me everywhere
I wanted to go

276
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,160
and show me the world.

277
00:10:58,690 --> 00:10:59,570
Since then,

278
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,770
I've decided

279
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,130
to bring him to any places
he wants to go

280
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,770
when I have the strength.

281
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,250
However, when my Martial Soul awakened,

282
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,490
I realized that we have
different Martial Souls.

283
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,600
And then I knew that he fostered me.

284
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,930
What's your Martial Soul?

285
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,890
Can you fly too?

286
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,280
My...

287
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,160
It sure can fly

288
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,080
with the wings of imagination.

289
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,570
Am I right?

290
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,960
Forget about Headmaster.

291
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,810
Let's talk about Master.

292
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:20,720
How many Soul Rings does he possess?

293
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,010
Seven or eight?

294
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,040
Does he have nine instead?

295
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,450
Does this really matter?

296
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,330
Of course.

297
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,330
Our Headmaster is the Soul Saint
with seven Soul Rings.

298
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,280
How about Master?

299
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,250
He only has two Soul Rings.

300
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:36,400
What?

301
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,450
Two Soul Rings?

302
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,520
Asking a Soul Master with two Soul Rings
to teach us?

303
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,200
What's wrong with Headmaster?

304
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,080
Numbers of Soul Ring

305
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,570
couldn't decide one's strength.

306
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,080
If that's the case,

307
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,200
tell me then.

308
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:48,960
What could decide one's strength?

309
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,770
The theory teacher is studying

310
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,080
is the most powerful one
on Douluo Continent.

311
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,840
So, were those tricks you used to fight
with Mr. Zhao

312
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:54,930
also taught by him?

313
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:56,720
No.

314
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:57,770
What did he teach then?

315
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,330
Theory.

316
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:00,960
Theory?

317
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:02,720
The reason I came to Shi Lan Ke School

318
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,280
is to learn to become stronger,

319
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,600
not for theory study.

320
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:06,690
In my opinion,

321
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,280
it's not enough for one
to merely have power.

322
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,720
Without the support of theories,

323
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,520
he will never become

324
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,720
a powerful Soul Master.

325
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:12,640
Who are you referring to?

326
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,400
Tang San.

327
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,200
Sir?

328
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,960
Master...

329
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,810
Come out.

330
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,160
Old Hei, let me do it.

331
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,200
Thank you.

332
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:31,400
Thank you.

333
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,250
Brother Dai,

334
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,330
why do you have beef with Tang San?

335
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,330
I don't.

336
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,250
Let me put it in this way.

337
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:44,040
Why don't you like Tang San?

338
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,010
He is smart.

339
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,040
But at the wrong place.

340
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:48,600
You're referring

341
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,930
to those tricks he used

342
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:51,930
when confronted with Mr. Zhao?

343
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,330
Not only that.

344
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,040
After he has won over Mr. Zhao,

345
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,450
there was black smoke emerging from him.

346
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,930
Didn't you find it strange?

347
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,040
No.

348
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,250
As long as he won, right?

349
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,840
But I don't want my partner

350
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,840
to win the fight

351
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,690
with heretic means.

352
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,520
I think Tang San is quite nice though.

353
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,400
Last time, he saved me
with all his might

354
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,280
when I was about to die.

355
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,250
I can see he's righteous.

356
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,690
You're so naive.

357
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,330
How could you trust him
with small favours?

358
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:17,490
Tang San

359
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,570
has so many things that
I can't see through.

360
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,200
Well, time will tell.

361
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,250
You'll understand him later.

362
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:26,640
Brother,

363
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,370
our class starts tomorrow.

364
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,720
Do you want to hang around in the city?

365
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,960
I'm not going. Go yourself.

366
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,250
Let's go.

367
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,570
Stop working.

368
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:34,840
Let's go together.

369
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,130
Don't isolate yourself.

370
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:36,890
Go with me.

371
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:37,720
Let's hang out.

372
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,330
Let's go.

373
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,200
Stop being angry.

374
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:39,890
Go.

375
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,720
Tang San?

376
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,400
Tang San.

377
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,450
I've no idea that you know this.

378
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,370
My dad taught me.

379
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,250
He said this can help with my stamina.

380
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,890
When I was in Nuoding School,

381
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,570
I used to forge iron to make a living.

382
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,490
Brother Dai...

383
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,160
Tang San, are you sure
you want to work here?

384
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,080
Don't worry, Sir.

385
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,160
I've thought it over.

386
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,960
I could train my stamina
with forging the iron.

387
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,280
It won't affect my study.

388
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,370
Well.

389
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:22,690
But, once I found that

390
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:23,720
you're lagging behind,

391
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,280
I won't allow you to do this again.

392
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,840
Sure.

393
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,200
Old granny, what are you doing?

394
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,490
Eighty Gold Soul Coins are big bucks.

395
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,200
I can't owe you this.

396
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,720
There is a famine in the village.

397
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,600
If it wasn't you who helped us,

398
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,490
perhaps we would die of hunger.

399
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,570
Your favour is too big for us.

400
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,370
Don't thank me.

401
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,010
It's just a small deal. I mean it.

402
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,080
We'll find all means
to return the money to you.

403
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,770
You don't have
to return the money though.

404
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,890
Don't mention it again.

405
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,640
No way.

406
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,600
This food is enough.

407
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,690
We'll definitely find ways

408
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,570
to repay you.

409
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:05,600
I've never thought that

410
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,330
he used the admission fee

411
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,840
to help the needy.

412
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,600
One of
the Ten Core Competing Power of Martial Soul

413
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,200
that I've researched and proposed

414
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,160
is the Theory of Martial Soul Mimicry.

415
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,400
Soul Master with Plant Branch Martial Soul

416
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,080
is not necessary to absorb

417
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,570
Soul Ring from
Plant Branch Soul Beast.

418
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,040
As for those with Beast Soul...

Under certain conditions,

421
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:53,600
both of them can combine.

422
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,600
Theoretically,

423
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,770
the more the Soul Ring,
the stronger the strength.

424
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,840
It's said that the possessor
of ten Soul Rings

425
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,450
will become an immortal.

426
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,280
Headmaster.

427
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:10,960
You're back?

428
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,570
What have you learnt

429
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,490
in these days?

430
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,960
Master taught us about

431
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,520
Ten Core Competing Powers
of Martial Soul.

432
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,080
What are they?

433
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,690
Firstly...

434
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,490
Tell me, Dai Mu Bai.

435
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,080
Say whatever you could recall.

436
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:34,400
What? You can't remember any of them?

437
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:35,640
It's impossible to win over rivals

438
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,840
with theory.

439
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,010
Without the conclusion of
pioneers' experience,

440
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,130
perhaps you won't even know

441
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:41,810
what does Martial Soul mean.

442
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,160
Anyhow, I don't believe in

443
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,520
those theories that haven't been proven.

444
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,250
His theories have been proven.

445
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,130
My Martial Soul is Blue Silver Plant.

446
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,720
Yet I'm able to absorb

447
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,840
the Soul Ring of Thorn Apple Snake.

448
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,490
This is the so-called
Theory of Martial Soul Mimicry.

449
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:56,490
I would rather believe that

450
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,250
only through hard training

451
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,520
can truly improve myself.

452
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,570
As for the mimicry theory or something,

453
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,930
just let those who need it to learn.

454
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,450
You all may go back.

455
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,520
Headmaster...

456
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:15,570
Dai...

457
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,920
Don't force him
if he doesn't want to learn.

458
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,560
Everyone has their own choice.

459
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,320
Dai Mu Bai

460
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,840
is too arrogant and confident.

461
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,650
It won't benefit him
if he still behaves like this.

462
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,960
It's because my level is too low.

463
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,170
That's normal for him not to follow me.

464
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,410
I can't let his bad behaviour
goes unchecked.

465
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,770
I've received news just now.

466
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,080
Perhaps this might be an opportunity.

467
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,250
What is it?

468
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,560
Headmaster,

469
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,050
today is our rest day.

470
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,010
Why do you call for us

471
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,050
in this early morning?

472
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:08,720
Well.

473
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,720
Yesterday,

474
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,490
there was a businessman
who came to seek help.

475
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,440
According to him,

476
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,200
when he was on his way to do business,

477
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,370
he passed by a village.

478
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,770
And he found something strange

479
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,440
happened in the village.

480
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,890
He claimed that
if this can't be settled,

481
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,410
he'll never dare
to take that path again.

482
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,410
Therefore, he entrusted us

483
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,410
to do the investigation.

484
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,560
How much money do you collect from him?

485
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,890
This is not about the monetary matter.

486
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,170
As a Soul Master,

487
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,010
we're responsible to provide help

488
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:35,770
for those villagers.

489
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,200
You must bear it in your mind.

490
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,650
You're right.

491
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,080
Let's set off now

492
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,440
and try to reach the village
before lunch.

493
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,050
Let's go.

494
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:43,720
Let's go.

495
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,170
Tang San, how far is it to go?

496
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,050
I'm exhausted.

497
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,530
It seems it may take some more time.

498
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,600
Do you want me to carry you?

499
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,170
Sure.

500
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:55,720
Up.

501
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,050
What's wrong? You don't want it?

502
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,680
It's fine. No need.

503
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,720
Tang San.

504
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,410
Did Master tell you anything before?

505
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,530
Nope.

506
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,170
I was planning to go working
this afternoon.

507
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,170
Yet I can't go now.

508
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:11,840
Working?

509
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,250
I forge iron to make a living.

510
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,410
Brother Dai and I saw you that day.

511
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,010
Ou Si Ke,

512
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,080
did Headmaster

513
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,250
always accept

514
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,410
this kind of task to help others with chores?

515
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,840
Not always.

516
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,170
But, Headmaster did mention that

517
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,010
we have to grow from the battle.

518
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,320
What is our battle?

519
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,290
Our battle is

520
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,410
to help others to do cleaning chores.

521
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,320
I couldn't know
what he's thinking about.

522
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,560
Is this task

523
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,440
part of the battle?

524
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,200
I've no idea.

525
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,010
Maybe this is a mysterious course.

526
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,010
Did this happen before?

527
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,370
Shi Lan Ke School

528
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,200
doesn't have fixed schedules.

529
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,650
We'll learn

530
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,290
whatever Headmaster teaches us.

531
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,410
It may seem somewhat random.

532
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,080
But the outcome is extremely useful.

533
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,650
This must be the wisdom of Headmaster.

534
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,890
You seem to admire Headmaster a lot.

535
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,770
Of course.

536
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,290
Headmaster is the one who raised me

537
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,410
and teach me how to use Martial Soul.

538
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,130
Although he's kind of stingy,

539
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,320
however, he's doing it for the sake
of the school.

540
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,170
In this world,

541
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:14,560
Headmaster

542
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,890
is the one I most admire.

543
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,010
I can understand you.

544
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,130
I have a great teacher too.

545
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:24,600
If it wasn't him,

546
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,370
I would die

547
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,560
in the hands of Xiao Chen Yu.

548
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:29,650
Tang San,

549
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,440
according to the theory of drama,

550
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,650
both of us have similar backgrounds.

551
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,800
I don't think our background

552
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,080
is similar though.

553
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,800
We must be under the same concept.

554
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,560
I don't think so.

555
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,200
You've given me this.

556
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,490
It's a token of our friendship.

557
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,560
- Don't.
- Token of friendship.

558
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:48,960
Please don't.

559
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,010
This is just a gift,

560
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:50,890
nothing special.

561
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:52,890
Tang San.

562
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,440
As long as you're in school,

563
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:55,680
I have your back.

564
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,890
Why haven't we reached yet?

565
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:18,770
Everyone,

566
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,720
when we were in school just now,

567
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,050
I've told you

568
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,650
the village ahead of us

569
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,170
has something strange happened.

570
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,410
What is that?

571
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:28,800
You may have to investigate

572
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,080
the actual situation.

573
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,720
Find your own answer.

574
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,370
This is the first collaboration
you have.

575
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,170
Hopefully, you could trust each other.

576
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,410
Take note of this,

577
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,680
this is also counted as your exam.

578
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,800
The consequence

579
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,530
will impact your results.

580
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,170
Walk till the end,

581
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,250
you'll reach the village.

582
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,010
Aren't you going with us?

583
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,770
This is your task.

584
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,890
Accomplish with your own force.

585
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:56,650
Sure.

586
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:57,840
Let's go.

587
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:58,680
Okay.

588
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,010
Let's go.

589
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,440
The observer is not necessary to join.

590
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,800
I'm willing to be an observer too.

591
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,530
Sure.

592
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,490
I'll burn all your things then.

593
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,010
Headmaster is right.

594
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,840
We must grow from the battle.

595
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,130
I have to grow.

596
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,200
I have to fight.

597
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:21,890
Wait for me.

598
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,370
I'm willing to go with them.

599
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:24,920
Mark my words,

600
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,410
you're just an observer.

601
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,170
I know.

602
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,320
I won't trouble them.

603
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,840
Are you really letting them handle all?

604
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,890
You've started to worry about them?

605
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:58,650
Until now,

606
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,080
I haven't taken in anything.

607
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,170
How am I going to investigate?

608
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,650
Just hang in there.

609
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,200
After entering the village,

610
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,050
follow my instruction.

611
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,410
Why?

612
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,800
Our team will be scattered

613
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,010
without one's instruction?

614
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,080
I mean why should I listen to you?

615
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,440
Because I'm the strongest.

616
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,920
Is it the cocky guy the strongest one?

617
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,080
You can leave if you don't want to.

618
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,720
I'm also part of Shi Lan Ke,

619
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,770
why should I listen to you?

620
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,840
You're eligible only if you defeat me.

621
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,370
Calm down, please.

622
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,320
Aren't we have to trust each other?

623
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,800
Why do you start quarreling now?

624
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,560
What happened?

625
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,410
A small gift for you.

626
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,130
Calm down.

627
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,770
Brother Dai.

628
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:33,600
Let's move.

629
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,560
What's wrong?

630
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,370
Do you find that

631
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,290
there is lots of chickens
in this village?

632
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,370
Anything wrong?

633
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,800
I used to live in the village back then.

634
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,290
Villagers will keep some

635
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,720
chickens and ducks

636
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,440
and also dogs.

637
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,320
But, there are only chickens
in Nightfire Village.

638
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,410
This...

639
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,410
Does it matter?

640
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,320
I don't think it's strange.

641
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,960
I mean...

642
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,200
Look at the ground.

643
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,770
It's too clean.

644
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:29,890
So what?

645
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,680
Perhaps it's nothing.

646
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:33,770
Let's go.

647
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,050
Wu.

648
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,130
This cottage

649
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,600
looks like it has been burnt.

650
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,650
It is all burnt.

651
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,840
Did anyone try to put out the fire?

652
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,320
That's strange.

653
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,130
Look.

654
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,600
The grass around the cottage
remains green.

655
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,010
Yet the cottage is burnt.

656
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:07,600
It seems like the fire

657
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,720
was blocked inside the cottage

658
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:09,680
by something.

659
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,960
Therefore, it didn't spread.

660
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,680
If your words are true,

661
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,170
this is fishy.

662
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,010
Brother Dai, what's the situation now?

663
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,530
Let's go and find
the village head first.

664
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,600
I have a sense of impending doom.

665
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,440
Why?

666
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,650
I can't tell.

667
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,320
Don't worry.

668
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:33,440
As long as I'm here,

669
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,010
I'll protect you well.

670
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:36,920
Let's go.

671
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:39,920
Come.

672
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:11,840
Let me do it, sir.

673
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,080
Seek help?

674
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,600
No.

675
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,170
But we've received a distress message

676
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,800
from Nightfire Village.

677
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,490
It's from a businessman who passed by.

678
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:21,800
He said that in the night,

679
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:22,890
the village was caught in a big fire.

680
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,410
And there was a black monster

681
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
leaped up from the fire

682
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,560
and rushed straight to the village.

683
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,130
I see.

684
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,720
It was just

685
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,920
a normal house fire.

686
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,250
I reckon

687
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,490
the businessman

688
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,560
might not understand what has happened.

689
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,320
And makes you come here.

690
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:42,530
Well.

691
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,170
I'll treat you to a meal tonight

692
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,840
as my apologies.

693
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,170
I'm sorry

694
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,370
to trouble you all.

695
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:49,890
Sir,

696
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,290
how about the black monster?

697
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,680
Don't say it.

698
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,250
Nightfire Village

699
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,560
has been standing here for hundred years

700
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,600
calmly,

701
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:00,890
silently

702
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,050
and steadily.

703
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,080
How could it be a monster here?

704
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,680
Sir,

705
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,650
perhaps you don't know about this?

706
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,080
What do you mean?

707
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,410
I'm the head of this village.

708
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,560
I should know everything.

709
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:16,920
You're right though.

710
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:17,890
Sir,

711
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,840
the burnt house you said,

712
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,410
is it located at the entrance there?

713
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,440
Yes.

714
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,490
Sir,

715
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,410
when did it happen?

716
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,370
A few days ago.

717
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:30,920
Were you there?

718
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:31,720
I...

719
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,890
I was sleeping at that time.

720
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,890
When I reached there,

721
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,370
the fire has been put out.

722
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,080
Did you realize that

723
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,050
only one cottage was burnt in that area,

724
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,600
and the plants around it
remain in good shape?

725
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,600
It's just like...

726
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,680
Just like there's something

727
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,530
in the cottage

728
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,840
blocking the fire

729
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,920
from spreading out.

730
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,320
Your imagination is kind of rich.

731
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,680
That was because the villagers

732
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,840
put out the fire in time.

733
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,130
Why do you

734
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,290
have so many questions?

735
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:07,720
Sir...

736
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,800
Sir,

737
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:10,770
I think

738
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,720
the businessman must have

739
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,250
seen it wrong.

740
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,200
He must be regarding the villagers
who try to put out the fire

741
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,530
as the black monster.

742
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,490
Think about it.

743
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,720
In the windy and pitch-black night,

744
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:19,770
the fire was raging.

745
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,080
It must have stretched the shadow.

746
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,770
This must be a misunderstanding.

747
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,440
I think that

748
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,560
your words do make sense.

749
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:26,960
I'll take this as an idea

750
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,250
to write my story.

751
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,010
Your analysis makes sense.

752
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,080
That's that truth.

753
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:33,290
But, sir...

754
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,050
But, sir.

755
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,490
We came all the way from our school

756
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,250
because of the distress message.

757
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,960
It's hard for us

758
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,080
to go back empty-handed.

759
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,650
He's right, sir.

760
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,130
We can't explain to our Headmaster.

761
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:49,960
Well...

762
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,130
Sir...

763
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,370
It's fine.

764
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:53,010
I'm fine.

765
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:53,680
I...

766
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,600
I don't want to drink anymore.

767
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,490
I know you're kind, right?

768
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,290
You're caring about Nightfire Village.

769
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,010
Well.

770
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,080
I'll still treat you to a meal tonight.

771
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,170
Besides, I'll give all of you

772
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,080
one Gold Soul Coin each.

773
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:07,770
That's great.

774
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,170
Thank you, sir.

775
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,200
A reward for helping.

776
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:10,770
Sure.

777
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,010
Tang San, what do you mean?

778
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,920
Headmaster asked us to come
for investigation,

779
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,170
not for cheating money.

780
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,440
I didn't say I quit.

781
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,840
Why did you stop me just now?

782
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,800
Didn't you see that

783
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,530
the village head doesn't want us
to investigate?

784
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,920
If you keep on asking him,

785
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,320
he'll get annoyed

786
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,320
and hinders us from investigating.

787
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:33,250
That's why you purposely said that
you want to quit investigating.

788
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,170
Let them loose their guard first.

789
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,320
We'll go to other places
to investigate.

790
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,320
This village is indeed strange.

791
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,010
Brother, drink some water.

792
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,410
Tang San, you're smart.

793
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,800
But without the help of
the village head,

794
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
how are we going to investigate?

795
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:50,840
The village is big,

796
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,050
there must be other clues.

797
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,080
We still have time before night falls.

798
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:54,920
Let's look for

799
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,290
villagers who are willing to help.

800
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,530
Sure.

801
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,320
Okay.

802
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,530
You all go yourself.
I don't want to join.

803
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,290
Whatever.

804
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:03,370
Set off now.

805
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,530
Let's gather before the sky turns dark.

806
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:05,130
Sure.

807
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:05,840
Let's go.

808
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,320
Afterwards, I hope that

809
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,440
you could discuss with me

810
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,130
in advance.

811
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,490
Because I'm the Leader of the team.

812
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:16,650
Brother Dai,

813
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,080
sometimes it's impossible

814
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,960
to discuss in advance.

815
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,680
We should refine the plan then.

816
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,530
If you always do things
without informing,

817
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:23,920
the situation will be beyond control.

818
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,800
You've witnessed the situation then.

819
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:26,770
I don't have...

820
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:27,960
Stop explaining.

821
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:29,250
Go now.

822
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,290
No need.

823
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,200
I've got it.

824
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,050
Sir,

825
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,680
during the fire that night,

826
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,200
you were there.

827
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,080
Why did you lie to us?

828
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,840
I've no idea what you're saying.

829
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,960
The villagers told us

830
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,720
the monster is in the village.

831
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,410
They want us to help too.

832
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,440
Who said this?

833
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,080
Tell me.

834
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,440
I want to speak to the person.

835
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,600
It's not important.

836
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:06,920
Sir,

837
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,890
tell us now.

838
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,560
What was the black image,

839
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:10,560
which is neither a Soul Beast

840
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,770
nor a beast,

841
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,050
appeared that night?

842
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:15,680
Sir,

843
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,410
Only if you tell us the truth

844
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,680
can we help you.

845
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,600
That's right.

846
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,010
All right.

847
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,050
That night,

848
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:32,720
I was there

849
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:33,890
and

850
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,920
I've witnessed

851
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,720
a black figure

852
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,440
leaped up from the house

853
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,560
and rushed out.

854
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,720
Red eyes in the smoke?

855
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:52,050
Perhaps it was the blaze.

856
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,530
Why didn't you investigate it?

857
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,890
Villages

858
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,410
are dry places.

859
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,600
It's normal for it to catch fire.

860
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,770
Besides, after that night,

861
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:06,080
nothing strange had happened.

862
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,410
Furthermore,

863
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,440
if I find someone to investigate,

864
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:15,170
it will not only consume manpower
and resources

865
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,370
but also cost me a lot of money.

866
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,890
You're right.

867
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:23,890
Sir,

868
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,320
do you think that

869
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,720
we're cheating your money?

870
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:30,290
Isn't that true?

871
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:37,800
Sir,

872
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,680
we're here to help you.

873
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:41,200
If we can't find the culprit,

874
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:43,800
we won't take a single cent from you.

875
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,410
Sir,

876
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,680
are there any survivors

877
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,600
from the affected family?

878
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:51,320
Yes.

879
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,720
It's a kid.

880
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,170
Ma Hong Jun.

881
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,530
Ma Hong Jun?

882
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,200
Where is he now?

883
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,560
He must have suffered a lot

884
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,050
from this accident.

885
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,170
Don't further traumatize him.

886
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,200
Tell me, where is he now?

887
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,050
I...

888
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:07,890
I've no idea.

889
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,890
Since the accident,

890
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,250
he became weird

891
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,130
and refuse to meet people.

892
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,720
I haven't seen him for days.

893
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:17,530
How old is he?

894
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,650
Around 15 years old.

895
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,080
How does he look like?

896
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,800
He has a round face and he's short.

897
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,170
He looks adorable too.

898
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,170
Everyone got it now?

899
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,840
Let's spread up to look for Ma Hong Jun.

900
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,770
Bring him back once you find him.

901
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,370
For those timid ones, just stay here.

902
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,370
Sir,

903
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,840
how many chickens are there
in the village?

904
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,010
Chickens?

905
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,770
I've no idea.

906
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,370
Well...

907
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:53,920
We have many

908
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,010
chickens, chicks,

909
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:56,440
roosters and hens here.

910
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:58,680
Were there any casualties in that fire?

911
00:33:59,130 --> 00:33:59,840
Yes.

912
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,720
Ma Hong Jun's father died in the fire.

913
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:04,200
Has he been buried yet?

914
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:05,370
Yes.

915
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,410
At the west of the village.

916
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,560
Thank you.

917
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:11,720
Thank you.

918
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:13,960
Tang San.

919
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:15,050
Tang San.

920
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,170
Hold on.

921
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,010
Why did you ask about the chickens?

922
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,530
I'm thinking that

923
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,490
will Ma Hong Jun go to the grave

924
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:23,640
as he misses his father?

925
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,160
That makes sense.

926
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:27,250
Go and check it out.

927
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,160
I'll wait for you here.

928
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:29,880
You're not going with us?

929
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,880
Yes.

930
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,050
I would rather spend my time

931
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,960
writing new scripts.

932
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:37,490
I don't find it interesting

933
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,810
being a Soul Master.

934
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:42,850
Only art.

935
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,680
Only art

936
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,330
could be immortal.

937
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:51,120
Why do you

938
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,250
still stay in Shi Lan Ke School?

939
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:56,440
I come

940
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,090
to collect ideas for creation.

941
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,250
Let's take you as an example.

942
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:00,960
Both of you are good materials for me.

943
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,050
Us?

944
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:02,570
Yes.

945
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,330
For example, you.

946
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,050
You're pretty and adorable.

947
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,440
Why do you come to Shi Lan Ke School?

948
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,440
Why do you choose
to become a Soul Master

949
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,360
regardless of challenges?

950
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:11,290
What's your reason?

951
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,680
All of these are the contradiction
and conflicts in drama.

952
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,360
Do you know that?

953
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,160
I want to find out
the nature of Martial Soul.

954
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,050
Nature?

955
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,050
That's so profound.

956
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:21,610
I want to venture into a new path.

957
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,330
What path is that?

958
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,400
I want to find out

959
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,120
could Soul Master obtain Soul Ring

960
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,160
without hunting for Soul Beast?

961
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:28,770
This...

962
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:30,360
might be hard.

963
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:31,880
Over the past thousands of years,

964
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,050
all Soul Masters get upgraded level

965
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:34,810
through Soul Beast hunting.

966
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,250
But I want to try.

967
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:38,010
I'll accompany you.

968
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:39,200
Both of you

969
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,050
can go now.
