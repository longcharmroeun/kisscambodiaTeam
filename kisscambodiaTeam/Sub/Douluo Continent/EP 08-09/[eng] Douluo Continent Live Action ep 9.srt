<i>Episode 9</i>

15
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,390
When does Shi Lan Ke School

16
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,350
have something to do

17
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,180
with Martial Soul Hall?

18
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,540
Shi Lan Ke School

19
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,470
has no relation with them at all.

20
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,110
Is Su Yun Tao from
Martial Soul Hall there too?

21
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,820
Is he the one you want to meet?

22
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,260
Yes.

23
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,300
Yesterday, I stalked him.

24
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,070
I saw him

25
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,390
entered the City Main Office
of Suo Tuo City.

26
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,500
And now the city

27
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,470
is full of this notice.

28
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,070
They have admitted

29
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,940
Shi Lan Ke School's
teaching qualification?

30
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,350
Really?

31
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:15,990
I heard that Governor

32
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,820
always wants to dominate
Shi Lan Ke School.

33
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,620
However, your Headmaster rejected it.

34
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,590
That's true.

35
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,020
Governor decided

36
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,990
to target the school,

37
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,230
but he changed his mind suddenly.

38
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,510
And now the officer of
Martial Soul Hall appears.

39
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,430
This means that

40
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,740
Governor is oppressed by
Martial Soul Hall.

41
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,950
That's why he has to admit
the status of the school.

42
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,310
But Su Yun Tao is just an officer.

43
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,150
Is he able to influence
Governor's decision?

44
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,020
He is the direct disciple

45
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,740
of the chief of Martial Soul Hall.

46
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,710
His identity is prestigious.

47
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,950
The chief of Martial Soul Hall?

48
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,620
The invincible of Douluo Continent?

49
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,710
Why does he approach Headmaster?

50
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,990
Our Headmaster

51
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,310
is poor and ugly.

52
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,460
What's his intention then?

53
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,820
Are Su Yun Tao and Hu Lie Na

54
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,710
still in school?

55
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,020
When we went out just now,

56
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,900
Su Yun Tao has left.

57
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,150
Perhaps Hu Lie Na still stays.

58
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,820
I'm still worried.

59
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,020
Bring me to the school.

60
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:06,900
I want to see your Headmaster.

61
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:07,620
Sure.

62
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,350
Master,

63
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,820
it's okay for you
to meet with Headmaster.

64
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,020
However, his behaviour

65
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,990
is quite strange.

66
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,460
You have to get prepared.

67
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,230
Headmaster.

68
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,660
Someone is here to see you.

69
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,820
I've been looking for you
over the years,

70
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,510
yet I couldn't find you.

71
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,260
Where have you been?

72
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,740
Why are you looking for me?

73
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,660
To return me the money?

74
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:07,950
Regarding this matter,

75
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,540
don't say in front of them.

76
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,020
Gang.

77
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,430
Gang?

78
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,070
Since Golden Iron Triangle
has disbanded,

79
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,180
where have you been?

80
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,740
I was in Nuoding School,

81
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,350
working as a guest teacher
without any contribution.

82
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,710
But for this time,

83
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,220
I come here to send my disciple Tang San

84
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,100
and his sister, Wu for admission.

85
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,710
Is Tang San your disciple?

86
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,710
Why are you willing to send him here?

87
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,500
Because I have trust in you.

88
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,500
These two kids are talented.

89
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,030
Why didn't you inform me

90
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,500
before sending them here?

91
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,380
I hope that

92
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,710
they could enter into this school
with their ability.

93
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,310
You seem to have great confidence
in them.

94
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,310
Brother,

95
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,910
I have something to tell you.

96
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,780
Well.

97
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,100
Come to my place.

98
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:50,710
You all go and look for

99
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,870
those villagers

100
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,100
who need to do house maintenance

101
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,750
and help them out.

102
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,910
Remember to collect cash
when you finish that.

103
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,150
Issue a receipt
if they don't have cash.

104
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,500
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

105
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,500
Gang, come.

106
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,430
I've missed you so much.

107
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,380
Let's go.

108
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,260
Come.

109
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,590
Gang?

110
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,470
Come, Gang.

111
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,030
Please come in.

112
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,990
This is where I live.

113
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,340
It looks kind of shabby,

114
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,430
but it's a lovely place.

115
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,340
Welcome in.

116
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:15,710
Sure.

117
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,100
Here.

118
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,260
Have a seat.

119
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:19,500
Thank you, brother.

120
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,340
Have a seat.

121
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,190
I heard that you insisted
to run the school by yourself.

122
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,260
You only accept kids
that pass your test.

123
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,540
And they have become

124
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,630
great Soul Masters.

125
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,500
I do my best to teach them.

126
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,220
However, it's hard to keep
the school going.

127
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,060
I have to rely on the village
for the school

128
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,590
and help them with cleaning jobs

129
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,060
to square away teaching funds.

130
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,780
I can see that

131
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,190
they are the last batch of the school.

132
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,910
Well, stop complaining that you're poor.

133
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,870
To be honest, I'm somehow
envious of you.

134
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,710
Envious of your free life

135
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,590
and establishing an independent school.

136
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,260
Envious of me?

137
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,470
Stay here then.

138
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,540
Tang San and Wu wants to go to the city.

139
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,340
They are waiting for me.

140
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,060
I'll leave now.

141
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,500
Little brat.

142
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,150
What happened?

143
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:29,910
Ou Si Ke.

144
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,630
Get out of here. Don't eavesdrop.

145
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,710
Don't be angry.

146
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,590
I just want to reconfirm

147
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,220
the relationship between your school
and Martial Soul Hall.

148
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,380
You're asking about

149
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,220
the new girl from Martial Soul Hall,
right?

150
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,260
She came here for Dai Mu Bai.

151
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,060
Su Yun Tao brought her here.

152
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,590
He is the one who has awoken Tang San's
Martial Soul.

153
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,780
I heard that he is

154
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,100
the disciple of Bi Bi Dong,

155
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,430
the chief of Martial Soul Hall.

156
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,150
Sending a girl to Shi Lan Ke School

157
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,260
by himself,

158
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,340
is this normal?

159
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,190
Please be rest assured.

160
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,190
Shi Lan Ke School and Martial Soul Hall

161
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:02,990
have no relation.

162
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,500
It's the same with other powers.

163
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,310
As for this admission test,

164
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,710
besides Hu Lie Na,

165
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,910
there's also a girl

166
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,030
who came with a purpose.

167
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,340
Dai Mu Bai

168
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,220
is tall, composed like a nobleman

169
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,100
and he has strong strength.

170
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,780
He's popular in Suo Tuo City.

171
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,260
It has nothing to be surprised that

172
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,030
many girls go after him.

173
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,100
It's good to be young.

174
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,540
As for the older men,
they have only their speeches.

175
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,540
Don't judge the book

176
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,910
by its cover.

177
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,540
So?

178
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,150
You should have rejected those from
Martial Soul Hall to stay here.

179
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,310
I only take her as an observer.

180
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,150
Don't worry.

181
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:39,910
Besides,

182
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,630
she has helped the school a lot.

183
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,710
Her identity in Martial Soul Hall
is vague.

184
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,820
This happens to Tang San too.

185
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,590
But the school couldn't reject
any students

186
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,540
for this reason.

187
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:55,910
I'll stay.

188
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,060
In Shi Lan Ke School?

189
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,470
Don't you need a teacher?

190
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,820
My school is very poor.

191
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,150
I can do it for free.

192
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,660
I don't take advantage of others.

193
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,710
Do you want me to beg you?

194
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,780
You're doing this for the sake
of Tang San?

195
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,750
I need to observe the girl.

196
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,990
Make sure that

197
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,340
she won't lead trouble to Tang San.

198
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,470
I've never seen you

199
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,750
care about someone like this.

200
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,540
It never happens before.

201
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,660
He had kowtowed to me

202
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,380
and acknowledged me as his teacher.

203
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,470
I have to be responsible for him.

204
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,430
Besides, I've promised his father

205
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,540
to take care of him.

206
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,470
His father?

207
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,540
Who is it?

208
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:32,910
It's fine.

209
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,310
It's good to keep away

210
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,190
from secrets.

211
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,710
As long as you promise
to teach for free,

212
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,140
I won't ask anymore.

213
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,540
Didn't you say that

214
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,830
you don't take advantage of others?

215
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,700
You're not like others.

216
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,580
Sit down.

217
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,510
Drink some water.

218
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,580
How is it?

219
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,510
How many Soul Rings have you obtained
all these years?

220
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:00,870
I still remain at two.

221
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,270
That's impossible.

222
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,950
The fist I hit on you just now

223
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:04,750
was a test.

224
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,580
Yet it's tough.

225
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,900
You can't take it with Double Soul Rings.

226
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,540
Are you still studying
the Martial Soul Theory?

227
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,750
Operation means to enhance strength,

228
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,510
the most suitable environment
to cultivate Soul Power...

229
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,430
It looks boring.

230
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,070
Everyone is here?

231
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,540
Let me introduce a new teacher to you.

232
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,870
This is my bosom friend of many years.

233
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,020
He is also the master of
the Martial Soul Theory.

234
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,340
You can call him...

235
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,830
Call me Master.

236
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,190
From now onwards,

237
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,460
Master will be teaching you all

238
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,540
the Martial Soul Theory.

239
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,540
I hope that you could learn from him.

240
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,070
Don't disgrace our school.

241
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,390
Yes.

242
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,990
We have a new observer this year.

243
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,780
Introduce yourself.

244
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,430
Hello, I'm Hu Lie Na.

245
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,990
I'm from Martial Soul Hall.

246
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,580
Well.

247
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,540
That's all for the introduction.

248
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,950
Our admission has officially
accomplished.

249
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,700
Go and prepare yourself.

250
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,430
Our class will start tomorrow.

251
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,460
Please come in.

252
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,070
Hurry up.

253
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:13,900
Hurry up.

254
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,430
This is the male dorm.

255
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,460
Brother Dai's bed.

256
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,430
And this is mine.

257
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:21,830
Choose your bed from the rest.

258
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,270
By the way, where does Wu live?

259
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,630
Girls dorm is beside here.

260
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,870
But the school stipulates that

261
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,700
male students are not allowed
to disturb female students.

262
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,540
Got it. I'll sleep here.

263
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,540
Sure.

264
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:33,900
Besides,

265
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,340
I really can't believe that

266
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,390
Headmaster has

267
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,630
such a handsome and charming friend.

268
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,140
Our Headmaster is so stingy.

269
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,140
I've never seen

270
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,220
any of his friends since I was young.

271
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,140
Since you were young?

272
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,190
He is my foster father.

273
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,430
Back then, he would fly me to the sky

274
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,700
during my birthday.

275
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,580
He would bring me everywhere
I wanted to go

276
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,660
and show me the world.

277
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,070
Since then,

278
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,270
I've decided

279
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,630
to bring him to any places
he wants to go

280
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,270
when I have the strength.

281
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,750
However, when my Martial Soul awakened,

282
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,990
I realized that we have
different Martial Souls.

283
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,100
And then I knew that he fostered me.

284
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,430
What's your Martial Soul?

285
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,390
Can you fly too?

286
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,780
My...

287
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,660
It sure can fly

288
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,580
with the wings of imagination.

289
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,070
Am I right?

290
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,460
Forget about Headmaster.

291
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,310
Let's talk about Master.

292
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,220
How many Soul Rings does he possess?

293
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,510
Seven or eight?

294
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,540
Does he have nine instead?

295
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,950
Does this really matter?

296
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,830
Of course.

297
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,830
Our Headmaster is the Soul Saint
with seven Soul Rings.

298
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,780
How about Master?

299
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,750
He only has two Soul Rings.

300
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:30,900
What?

301
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:32,950
Two Soul Rings?

302
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,020
Asking a Soul Master with two Soul Rings
to teach us?

303
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,700
What's wrong with Headmaster?

304
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,580
Numbers of Soul Ring

305
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,070
couldn't decide one's strength.

306
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,580
If that's the case,

307
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,700
tell me then.

308
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,460
What could decide one's strength?

309
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,270
The theory teacher is studying

310
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,580
is the most powerful one
on Douluo Continent.

311
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,340
So, were those tricks you used to fight
with Mr. Zhao

312
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,430
also taught by him?

313
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,220
No.

314
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,270
What did he teach then?

315
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,830
Theory.

316
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,460
Theory?

317
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,220
The reason I came to Shi Lan Ke School

318
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,780
is to learn to become stronger,

319
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,100
not for theory study.

320
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,190
In my opinion,

321
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,780
it's not enough for one
to merely have power.

322
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,220
Without the support of theories,

323
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,020
he will never become

324
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,220
a powerful Soul Master.

325
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,140
Who are you referring to?

326
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,900
Tang San.

327
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,700
Sir?

328
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,460
Master...

329
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,310
Come out.

330
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,660
Old Hei, let me do it.

331
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:24,700
Thank you.

332
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:25,900
Thank you.

333
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:30,750
Brother Dai,

334
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,830
why do you have beef with Tang San?

335
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:33,830
I don't.

336
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,750
Let me put it in this way.

337
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,540
Why don't you like Tang San?

338
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,510
He is smart.

339
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,540
But at the wrong place.

340
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,100
You're referring

341
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,430
to those tricks he used

342
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,430
when confronted with Mr. Zhao?

343
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,830
Not only that.

344
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,540
After he has won over Mr. Zhao,

345
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,950
there was black smoke emerging from him.

346
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,430
Didn't you find it strange?

347
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,540
No.

348
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,750
As long as he won, right?

349
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,340
But I don't want my partner

350
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,340
to win the fight

351
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,190
with heretic means.

352
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,020
I think Tang San is quite nice though.

353
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,900
Last time, he saved me
with all his might

354
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,780
when I was about to die.

355
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,750
I can see he's righteous.

356
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,190
You're so naive.

357
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,830
How could you trust him
with small favours?

358
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:11,990
Tang San

359
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,070
has so many things that
I can't see through.

360
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,700
Well, time will tell.

361
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,750
You'll understand him later.

362
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,140
Brother,

363
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,870
our class starts tomorrow.

364
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,220
Do you want to hang around in the city?

365
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,460
I'm not going. Go yourself.

366
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,750
Let's go.

367
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,070
Stop working.

368
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,340
Let's go together.

369
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,630
Don't isolate yourself.

370
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,390
Go with me.

371
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,220
Let's hang out.

372
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:32,830
Let's go.

373
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,700
Stop being angry.

374
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,390
Go.

375
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,220
Tang San?

376
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:50,900
Tang San.

377
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,950
I've no idea that you know this.

378
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,870
My dad taught me.

379
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,750
He said this can help with my stamina.

380
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,390
When I was in Nuoding School,

381
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,070
I used to forge iron to make a living.

382
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,990
Brother Dai...

383
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,660
Tang San, are you sure
you want to work here?

384
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,580
Don't worry, Sir.

385
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,660
I've thought it over.

386
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,460
I could train my stamina
with forging the iron.

387
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,780
It won't affect my study.

388
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:15,870
Well.

389
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,190
But, once I found that

390
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,220
you're lagging behind,

391
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,780
I won't allow you to do this again.

392
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,340
Sure.

393
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,700
Old granny, what are you doing?

394
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,990
Eighty Gold Soul Coins are big bucks.

395
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,700
I can't owe you this.

396
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,220
There is a famine in the village.

397
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,100
If it wasn't you who helped us,

398
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,990
perhaps we would die of hunger.

399
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,070
Your favour is too big for us.

400
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,870
Don't thank me.

401
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,510
It's just a small deal. I mean it.

402
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,580
We'll find all means
to return the money to you.

403
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,270
You don't have
to return the money though.

404
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,390
Don't mention it again.

405
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,140
No way.

406
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,100
This food is enough.

407
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,190
We'll definitely find ways

408
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,070
to repay you.

409
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,100
I've never thought that

410
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,830
he used the admission fee

411
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,340
to help the needy.

412
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,100
One of
the Ten Core Competing Power of Martial Soul

413
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,700
that I've researched and proposed

414
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,660
is the Theory of Martial Soul Mimicry.

415
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,900
Soul Master with Plant Branch Martial Soul

416
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,580
is not necessary to absorb

417
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,070
Soul Ring from
Plant Branch Soul Beast.

418
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,540
As for those with Beast Soul...

Under certain conditions,

421
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,100
both of them can combine.

422
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,100
Theoretically,

423
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,270
the more the Soul Ring,
the stronger the strength.

424
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,340
It's said that the possessor
of ten Soul Rings

425
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:56,950
will become an immortal.

426
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:02,780
Headmaster.

427
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,460
You're back?

428
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,070
What have you learnt

429
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,990
in these days?

430
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,460
Master taught us about

431
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,020
Ten Core Competing Powers
of Martial Soul.

432
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,580
What are they?

433
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,190
Firstly...

434
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,990
Tell me, Dai Mu Bai.

435
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,580
Say whatever you could recall.

436
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,900
What? You can't remember any of them?

437
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,140
It's impossible to win over rivals

438
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,340
with theory.

439
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,510
Without the conclusion of
pioneers' experience,

440
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,630
perhaps you won't even know

441
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,310
what does Martial Soul mean.

442
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,660
Anyhow, I don't believe in

443
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,020
those theories that haven't been proven.

444
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,750
His theories have been proven.

445
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,630
My Martial Soul is Blue Silver Plant.

446
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,220
Yet I'm able to absorb

447
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,340
the Soul Ring of Thorn Apple Snake.

448
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,990
This is the so-called
Theory of Martial Soul Mimicry.

449
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:50,990
I would rather believe that

450
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,750
only through hard training

451
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,020
can truly improve myself.

452
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,070
As for the mimicry theory or something,

453
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,430
just let those who need it to learn.

454
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,950
You all may go back.

455
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,020
Headmaster...

456
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,070
Dai...

457
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,420
Don't force him
if he doesn't want to learn.

458
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,060
Everyone has their own choice.

459
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,820
Dai Mu Bai

460
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,340
is too arrogant and confident.

461
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,150
It won't benefit him
if he still behaves like this.

462
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,460
It's because my level is too low.

463
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,670
That's normal for him not to follow me.

464
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,910
I can't let his bad behaviour
goes unchecked.

465
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,270
I've received news just now.

466
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,580
Perhaps this might be an opportunity.

467
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,750
What is it?

468
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,060
Headmaster,

469
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,550
today is our rest day.

470
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,510
Why do you call for us

471
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,550
in this early morning?

472
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,220
Well.

473
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,220
Yesterday,

474
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,990
there was a businessman
who came to seek help.

475
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:06,940
According to him,

476
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,700
when he was on his way to do business,

477
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,870
he passed by a village.

478
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,270
And he found something strange

479
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,940
happened in the village.

480
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,390
He claimed that
if this can't be settled,

481
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,910
he'll never dare
to take that path again.

482
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,910
Therefore, he entrusted us

483
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,910
to do the investigation.

484
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,060
How much money do you collect from him?

485
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,390
This is not about the monetary matter.

486
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,670
As a Soul Master,

487
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,510
we're responsible to provide help

488
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,270
for those villagers.

489
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,700
You must bear it in your mind.

490
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,150
You're right.

491
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,580
Let's set off now

492
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,940
and try to reach the village
before lunch.

493
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:37,550
Let's go.

494
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:38,220
Let's go.

495
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,670
Tang San, how far is it to go?

496
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,550
I'm exhausted.

497
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,030
It seems it may take some more time.

498
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,100
Do you want me to carry you?

499
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:49,670
Sure.

500
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,220
Up.

501
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,550
What's wrong? You don't want it?

502
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,180
It's fine. No need.

503
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,220
Tang San.

504
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,910
Did Master tell you anything before?

505
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,030
Nope.

506
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,670
I was planning to go working
this afternoon.

507
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:05,670
Yet I can't go now.

508
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,340
Working?

509
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,750
I forge iron to make a living.

510
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,910
Brother Dai and I saw you that day.

511
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,510
Ou Si Ke,

512
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,580
did Headmaster

513
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,750
always accept

514
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,910
this kind of task to help others with chores?

515
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,340
Not always.

516
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,670
But, Headmaster did mention that

517
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,510
we have to grow from the battle.

518
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,820
What is our battle?

519
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,790
Our battle is

520
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,910
to help others to do cleaning chores.

521
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,820
I couldn't know
what he's thinking about.

522
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,060
Is this task

523
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,940
part of the battle?

524
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,700
I've no idea.

525
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,510
Maybe this is a mysterious course.

526
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,510
Did this happen before?

527
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,870
Shi Lan Ke School

528
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,700
doesn't have fixed schedules.

529
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,150
We'll learn

530
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:45,790
whatever Headmaster teaches us.

531
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,910
It may seem somewhat random.

532
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,580
But the outcome is extremely useful.

533
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:54,150
This must be the wisdom of Headmaster.

534
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,390
You seem to admire Headmaster a lot.

535
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,270
Of course.

536
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,790
Headmaster is the one who raised me

537
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:00,910
and teach me how to use Martial Soul.

538
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,630
Although he's kind of stingy,

539
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,820
however, he's doing it for the sake
of the school.

540
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:06,670
In this world,

541
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,060
Headmaster

542
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,390
is the one I most admire.

543
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:14,510
I can understand you.

544
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,630
I have a great teacher too.

545
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,100
If it wasn't him,

546
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:20,870
I would die

547
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,060
in the hands of Xiao Chen Yu.

548
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,150
Tang San,

549
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:25,940
according to the theory of drama,

550
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,150
both of us have similar backgrounds.

551
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,300
I don't think our background

552
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,580
is similar though.

553
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,300
We must be under the same concept.

554
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,060
I don't think so.

555
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,700
You've given me this.

556
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,990
It's a token of our friendship.

557
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,060
- Don't.
- Token of friendship.

558
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:43,460
Please don't.

559
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,510
This is just a gift,

560
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,390
nothing special.

561
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:47,390
Tang San.

562
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,940
As long as you're in school,

563
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,180
I have your back.

564
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,390
Why haven't we reached yet?

565
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,270
Everyone,

566
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,220
when we were in school just now,

567
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,550
I've told you

568
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,150
the village ahead of us

569
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,670
has something strange happened.

570
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:21,910
What is that?

571
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,300
You may have to investigate

572
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,580
the actual situation.

573
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,220
Find your own answer.

574
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,870
This is the first collaboration
you have.

575
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,670
Hopefully, you could trust each other.

576
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,910
Take note of this,

577
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,180
this is also counted as your exam.

578
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,300
The consequence

579
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,030
will impact your results.

580
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,670
Walk till the end,

581
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:44,750
you'll reach the village.

582
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,510
Aren't you going with us?

583
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,270
This is your task.

584
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,390
Accomplish with your own force.

585
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,150
Sure.

586
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,340
Let's go.

587
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,180
Okay.

588
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,510
Let's go.

589
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:00,940
The observer is not necessary to join.

590
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,300
I'm willing to be an observer too.

591
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,030
Sure.

592
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,990
I'll burn all your things then.

593
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,510
Headmaster is right.

594
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,340
We must grow from the battle.

595
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,630
I have to grow.

596
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,700
I have to fight.

597
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,390
Wait for me.

598
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:17,870
I'm willing to go with them.

599
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,420
Mark my words,

600
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,910
you're just an observer.

601
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,670
I know.

602
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,820
I won't trouble them.

603
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,340
Are you really letting them handle all?

604
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,390
You've started to worry about them?

605
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,150
Until now,

606
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,580
I haven't taken in anything.

607
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,670
How am I going to investigate?

608
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,150
Just hang in there.

609
00:22:58,990 --> 00:22:59,700
After entering the village,

610
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,550
follow my instruction.

611
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,910
Why?

612
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,300
Our team will be scattered

613
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,510
without one's instruction?

614
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,580
I mean why should I listen to you?

615
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:10,940
Because I'm the strongest.

616
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,420
Is it the cocky guy the strongest one?

617
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,580
You can leave if you don't want to.

618
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,220
I'm also part of Shi Lan Ke,

619
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,270
why should I listen to you?

620
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,340
You're eligible only if you defeat me.

621
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,870
Calm down, please.

622
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,820
Aren't we have to trust each other?

623
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,300
Why do you start quarreling now?

624
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,060
What happened?

625
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,910
A small gift for you.

626
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:25,630
Calm down.

627
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,270
Brother Dai.

628
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,100
Let's move.

629
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,060
What's wrong?

630
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,870
Do you find that

631
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,790
there is lots of chickens
in this village?

632
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,870
Anything wrong?

633
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,300
I used to live in the village back then.

634
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,790
Villagers will keep some

635
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,220
chickens and ducks

636
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,940
and also dogs.

637
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,820
But, there are only chickens
in Nightfire Village.

638
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:15,910
This...

639
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,910
Does it matter?

640
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:18,820
I don't think it's strange.

641
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,460
I mean...

642
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,700
Look at the ground.

643
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,270
It's too clean.

644
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,390
So what?

645
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,180
Perhaps it's nothing.

646
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,270
Let's go.

647
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:29,550
Wu.

648
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,630
This cottage

649
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,100
looks like it has been burnt.

650
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,150
It is all burnt.

651
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,340
Did anyone try to put out the fire?

652
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,820
That's strange.

653
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,630
Look.

654
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,100
The grass around the cottage
remains green.

655
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,510
Yet the cottage is burnt.

656
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,100
It seems like the fire

657
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,220
was blocked inside the cottage

658
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,180
by something.

659
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,460
Therefore, it didn't spread.

660
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,180
If your words are true,

661
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,670
this is fishy.

662
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,510
Brother Dai, what's the situation now?

663
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,030
Let's go and find
the village head first.

664
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,100
I have a sense of impending doom.

665
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:21,940
Why?

666
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,150
I can't tell.

667
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:26,820
Don't worry.

668
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:27,940
As long as I'm here,

669
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,510
I'll protect you well.

670
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:31,420
Let's go.

671
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,420
Come.

672
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,340
Let me do it, sir.

673
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,580
Seek help?

674
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,100
No.

675
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,670
But we've received a distress message

676
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,300
from Nightfire Village.

677
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:14,990
It's from a businessman who passed by.

678
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,300
He said that in the night,

679
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,390
the village was caught in a big fire.

680
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,910
And there was a black monster

681
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,940
leaped up from the fire

682
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,060
and rushed straight to the village.

683
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,630
I see.

684
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,220
It was just

685
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,420
a normal house fire.

686
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,750
I reckon

687
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,990
the businessman

688
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,060
might not understand what has happened.

689
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,820
And makes you come here.

690
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,030
Well.

691
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,670
I'll treat you to a meal tonight

692
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,340
as my apologies.

693
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,670
I'm sorry

694
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,870
to trouble you all.

695
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:44,390
Sir,

696
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,790
how about the black monster?

697
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,180
Don't say it.

698
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,750
Nightfire Village

699
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,060
has been standing here for hundred years

700
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,100
calmly,

701
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,390
silently

702
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,550
and steadily.

703
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,580
How could it be a monster here?

704
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,180
Sir,

705
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,150
perhaps you don't know about this?

706
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,580
What do you mean?

707
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,910
I'm the head of this village.

708
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,060
I should know everything.

709
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,420
You're right though.

710
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,390
Sir,

711
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,340
the burnt house you said,

712
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,910
is it located at the entrance there?

713
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:16,940
Yes.

714
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:20,990
Sir,

715
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,910
when did it happen?

716
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:23,870
A few days ago.

717
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,420
Were you there?

718
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,220
I...

719
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,390
I was sleeping at that time.

720
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,390
When I reached there,

721
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,870
the fire has been put out.

722
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,580
Did you realize that

723
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,550
only one cottage was burnt in that area,

724
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,100
and the plants around it
remain in good shape?

725
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,100
It's just like...

726
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,180
Just like there's something

727
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,030
in the cottage

728
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,340
blocking the fire

729
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,420
from spreading out.

730
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,820
Your imagination is kind of rich.

731
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,180
That was because the villagers

732
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,340
put out the fire in time.

733
00:27:58,790 --> 00:27:59,630
Why do you

734
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:00,790
have so many questions?

735
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:02,220
Sir...

736
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,300
Sir,

737
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,270
I think

738
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,220
the businessman must have

739
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:07,750
seen it wrong.

740
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,700
He must be regarding the villagers
who try to put out the fire

741
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,030
as the black monster.

742
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:11,990
Think about it.

743
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,220
In the windy and pitch-black night,

744
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,270
the fire was raging.

745
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,580
It must have stretched the shadow.

746
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,270
This must be a misunderstanding.

747
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,940
I think that

748
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,060
your words do make sense.

749
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,460
I'll take this as an idea

750
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,750
to write my story.

751
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,510
Your analysis makes sense.

752
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,580
That's that truth.

753
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:27,790
But, sir...

754
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:28,550
But, sir.

755
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,990
We came all the way from our school

756
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,750
because of the distress message.

757
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,460
It's hard for us

758
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,580
to go back empty-handed.

759
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,150
He's right, sir.

760
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,630
We can't explain to our Headmaster.

761
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,460
Well...

762
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:45,630
Sir...

763
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,870
It's fine.

764
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:47,510
I'm fine.

765
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,180
I...

766
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,100
I don't want to drink anymore.

767
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,990
I know you're kind, right?

768
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,790
You're caring about Nightfire Village.

769
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:54,510
Well.

770
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,580
I'll still treat you to a meal tonight.

771
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,670
Besides, I'll give all of you

772
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,580
one Gold Soul Coin each.

773
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:02,270
That's great.

774
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,670
Thank you, sir.

775
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:04,700
A reward for helping.

776
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,270
Sure.

777
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,510
Tang San, what do you mean?

778
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,420
Headmaster asked us to come
for investigation,

779
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:11,670
not for cheating money.

780
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,940
I didn't say I quit.

781
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,340
Why did you stop me just now?

782
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:18,300
Didn't you see that

783
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,030
the village head doesn't want us
to investigate?

784
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,420
If you keep on asking him,

785
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,820
he'll get annoyed

786
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:23,820
and hinders us from investigating.

787
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,750
That's why you purposely said that
you want to quit investigating.

788
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,670
Let them loose their guard first.

789
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,820
We'll go to other places
to investigate.

790
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,820
This village is indeed strange.

791
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,510
Brother, drink some water.

792
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,910
Tang San, you're smart.

793
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,300
But without the help of
the village head,

794
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,700
how are we going to investigate?

795
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,340
The village is big,

796
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,550
there must be other clues.

797
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,580
We still have time before night falls.

798
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,420
Let's look for

799
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,790
villagers who are willing to help.

800
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,030
Sure.

801
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:52,820
Okay.

802
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:55,030
You all go yourself.
I don't want to join.

803
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:56,790
Whatever.

804
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:57,870
Set off now.

805
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,030
Let's gather before the sky turns dark.

806
00:29:59,030 --> 00:29:59,630
Sure.

807
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:00,340
Let's go.

808
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:06,820
Afterwards, I hope that

809
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:07,940
you could discuss with me

810
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,630
in advance.

811
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,990
Because I'm the Leader of the team.

812
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,150
Brother Dai,

813
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,580
sometimes it's impossible

814
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,460
to discuss in advance.

815
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,180
We should refine the plan then.

816
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,030
If you always do things
without informing,

817
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,420
the situation will be beyond control.

818
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,300
You've witnessed the situation then.

819
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,270
I don't have...

820
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,460
Stop explaining.

821
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:23,750
Go now.

822
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:27,790
No need.

823
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,700
I've got it.

824
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:36,550
Sir,

825
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,180
during the fire that night,

826
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,700
you were there.

827
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,580
Why did you lie to us?

828
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,340
I've no idea what you're saying.

829
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,460
The villagers told us

830
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,220
the monster is in the village.

831
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,910
They want us to help too.

832
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:55,940
Who said this?

833
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,580
Tell me.

834
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:58,940
I want to speak to the person.

835
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,100
It's not important.

836
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:01,420
Sir,

837
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,390
tell us now.

838
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,060
What was the black image,

839
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,060
which is neither a Soul Beast

840
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,270
nor a beast,

841
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,550
appeared that night?

842
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,180
Sir,

843
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,910
Only if you tell us the truth

844
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,180
can we help you.

845
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,100
That's right.

846
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:20,510
All right.

847
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,550
That night,

848
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,220
I was there

849
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,390
and

850
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,420
I've witnessed

851
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,220
a black figure

852
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,940
leaped up from the house

853
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,060
and rushed out.

854
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,220
Red eyes in the smoke?

855
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,550
Perhaps it was the blaze.

856
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,030
Why didn't you investigate it?

857
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,390
Villages

858
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:53,910
are dry places.

859
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,100
It's normal for it to catch fire.

860
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,270
Besides, after that night,

861
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,580
nothing strange had happened.

862
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:04,910
Furthermore,

863
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,940
if I find someone to investigate,

864
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,670
it will not only consume manpower
and resources

865
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,870
but also cost me a lot of money.

866
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,390
You're right.

867
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,390
Sir,

868
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:19,820
do you think that

869
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,220
we're cheating your money?

870
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:24,790
Isn't that true?

871
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:32,300
Sir,

872
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,180
we're here to help you.

873
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,700
If we can't find the culprit,

874
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,300
we won't take a single cent from you.

875
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:42,910
Sir,

876
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,180
are there any survivors

877
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,100
from the affected family?

878
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:45,820
Yes.

879
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,220
It's a kid.

880
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,670
Ma Hong Jun.

881
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,030
Ma Hong Jun?

882
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,700
Where is he now?

883
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,060
He must have suffered a lot

884
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,550
from this accident.

885
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,670
Don't further traumatize him.

886
00:32:58,670 --> 00:32:59,700
Tell me, where is he now?

887
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:00,550
I...

888
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,390
I've no idea.

889
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,390
Since the accident,

890
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,750
he became weird

891
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,630
and refuse to meet people.

892
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,220
I haven't seen him for days.

893
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,030
How old is he?

894
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,150
Around 15 years old.

895
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:15,580
How does he look like?

896
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,300
He has a round face and he's short.

897
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,670
He looks adorable too.

898
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,670
Everyone got it now?

899
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,340
Let's spread up to look for Ma Hong Jun.

900
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,270
Bring him back once you find him.

901
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:30,870
For those timid ones, just stay here.

902
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:38,870
Sir,

903
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,340
how many chickens are there
in the village?

904
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,510
Chickens?

905
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,270
I've no idea.

906
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:46,870
Well...

907
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:48,420
We have many

908
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,510
chickens, chicks,

909
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:50,940
roosters and hens here.

910
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:53,180
Were there any casualties in that fire?

911
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:54,340
Yes.

912
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,220
Ma Hong Jun's father died in the fire.

913
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,700
Has he been buried yet?

914
00:33:59,270 --> 00:33:59,870
Yes.

915
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,910
At the west of the village.

916
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,060
Thank you.

917
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:06,220
Thank you.

918
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:08,460
Tang San.

919
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:09,550
Tang San.

920
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,670
Hold on.

921
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,510
Why did you ask about the chickens?

922
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,030
I'm thinking that

923
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,990
will Ma Hong Jun go to the grave

924
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,140
as he misses his father?

925
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,660
That makes sense.

926
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:21,750
Go and check it out.

927
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:22,660
I'll wait for you here.

928
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,380
You're not going with us?

929
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,380
Yes.

930
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,550
I would rather spend my time

931
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,460
writing new scripts.

932
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:31,990
I don't find it interesting

933
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,310
being a Soul Master.

934
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,350
Only art.

935
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,180
Only art

936
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,830
could be immortal.

937
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:45,620
Why do you

938
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,750
still stay in Shi Lan Ke School?

939
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:50,940
I come

940
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:52,590
to collect ideas for creation.

941
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,750
Let's take you as an example.

942
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,460
Both of you are good materials for me.

943
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,550
Us?

944
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:57,070
Yes.

945
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,830
For example, you.

946
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,550
You're pretty and adorable.

947
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:00,940
Why do you come to Shi Lan Ke School?

948
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,940
Why do you choose
to become a Soul Master

949
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,860
regardless of challenges?

950
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:05,790
What's your reason?

951
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,180
All of these are the contradiction
and conflicts in drama.

952
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:08,860
Do you know that?

953
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,660
I want to find out
the nature of Martial Soul.

954
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,550
Nature?

955
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,550
That's so profound.

956
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:16,110
I want to venture into a new path.

957
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:16,830
What path is that?

958
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:17,900
I want to find out

959
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,620
could Soul Master obtain Soul Ring

960
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:20,660
without hunting for Soul Beast?

961
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,270
This...

962
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:24,860
might be hard.

963
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,380
Over the past thousands of years,

964
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,550
all Soul Masters get upgraded level

965
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,310
through Soul Beast hunting.

966
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,750
But I want to try.

967
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:32,510
I'll accompany you.

968
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:33,700
Both of you

969
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:34,550
can go now.
