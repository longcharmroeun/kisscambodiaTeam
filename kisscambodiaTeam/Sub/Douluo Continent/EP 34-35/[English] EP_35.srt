Are you sure Hao Tian Soul Master is

15

behind Cang Hui School?

16
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:48,919
Shi Nian has always said so.

17
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,919
But in fact, no one has ever seen him.

18
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,359
Who does Shi Nian usually contact?

19
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,480
Who is his superior?

20
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,400
I think I remember an instance

21
00:01:57,999 --> 00:01:59,400
where he was talking
to a lump of black smoke.

22
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:00,919
I got closer to have a look,

23
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,919
but I wasn't able to see
who he was talking with.

24
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,359
Let's consider our next move

25
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,679
after we arrive in Martial Soul City

26
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,279
and see Hao Tian Soul Master.

27
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,040
If, by any chance,

28
00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:15,920
the person behind Cang Hui School

29
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,400
is indeed your father,

30
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,000
what will you do?

31
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,400
I wish he wouldn't do such things.

32
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,120
However,

33
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,239
if it is really him,

34
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:30,879
I will stop him from going down the wrong path.

35
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,959
My father has especially prepared
a horse carriage

36
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:39,799
for us.

37
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,840
This carriage has
great shock absorption performance.

38
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,120
We'll ride in comfort

39
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,879
all the way to Martial Soul City.

40

43
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,079
We will go to Martial Soul City on foot.

44
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,560
There is no time left for training

45
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,120

48
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,599

49
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:05,959
It can't be.

50
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:07,120

51
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,360

and deal with the procedures.

189
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,999
I'll wait for Dai Mu Bai and the others.

190
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:16,760
You'll wait?

191
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,640
Who are you...

192
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,159
The...

193
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:21,240
the Grand Chrysanthemum Master.

194
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,559
So who am I?

195
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:23,719
Pardon me.

196
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,040
The Crown Prince of Tian Dou Empire
also comes to Martial Soul City?

197
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,800
He should have other business here.

198
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,159
The chief has issued an order

199
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,240
to allow him to enter the city.

200
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:41,599
She issued an order
for the Crown Prince of Tian Dou Empire?

201
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,480
Yes.

202
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,920
It looks like the relationship
between Tian Dou Empire

203
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,120
and Martial Soul Hall

204
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,959
has become closer.

205
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,880
Yes.

206
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,079
How about this?

207
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,759
You enter the city first
and deal with the procedures.

208
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,199
I'll wait

209
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,560
for your students.

210
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,279
All right.

211
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,440
Greetings to the Chief.

212
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,959
Report to the Chief.

213
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:45,399
I have successfully

214
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,759
completed my mission.

215
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,440
And the results

216
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,279
are better than what I expected.

217
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,920
I'm sure you've known about this.

218
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,440
I have successfully replaced Xue Qing He.

219
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,120
Once the contest is finished,

220
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,199
I can go back to Tian Dou

221
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,199
and inherit the throne.

222
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,240
I know.

223
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,159
Initially,
my plan after leaving Martial Soul Hall

224
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,480
was to go to Shi Lan Ke School

225
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:08,320
and replace the Prince of Xing Luo, Dai Mu Bai.

226
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,159
But then I found out

227
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:12,040
that he has a powerful brother

228
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,159
named Dai Wei Shi.

229
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,839
The two brothers
are at odds with each other.

230
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:15,920
Dai Mu Bai is at a disadvantage.

231
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,320
He won't be able to inherit the throne.

232
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:18,440
Therefore,

233
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,560
I changed my plan

234
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,839
and chose Xue Qing He.

235
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,639
I know.

236
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,680
Chief.

237
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:26,680
Given the current situation,

238
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,839
I have another plan in mind.

239
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:29,320
We can

240
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,360
combine the power
of Martial Soul Hall and Tian Dou

241
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,680
to invade Xing Luo.

242
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,240
We can build up Martial Soul Empire

243
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,320
to dominate the world!

244
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,079
Enough!

245
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,079
I don't need you to tell me

246
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:40,959
what to do!

247
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,759
For the sake of Martial Soul Hall,

248
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:44,680
I wandered around

249
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,560
by myself.

250
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,159
I struggled hard and grew up alone.

251
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:48,839
Yes, I admit

252
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,800
I was willful at first.

253
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,560
I insisted on changing the plan.

254
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,599
But after all this time,

255
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:56,320
how could you dismiss

256
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,920
all my efforts

257
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,639
just because you don't need them?

258
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,360
Or perhaps,

259
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,360
all the efforts

260
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,560
and sacrifices I have made

261
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,279
for Martial Soul Hall

262
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,800
are worthless in your eyes?

263
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,680
I meant

264
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:12,000
you don't need to make these efforts.

265
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,639
But why?

266
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,880
Do you know

267
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,079
how many times I almost died

268
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,560
out there?

269
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:20,839
Had it not been

270
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:21,639
for Tang San who saved me,

271
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,399
you would have seen

272
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,079
a corpse now!

273
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:33,599
That Tang San...

274
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:38,240
I heard that he is gifted.

275
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:41,079
So, in your eyes,

276
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,320
whether I am dead

277
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:42,839
or alive

278
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:44,680
matters less than an outsider.
Is that right?

279
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,399
Do not forget your identity.

280
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,279
Yes. Teacher.

281
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,199
How many Soul Rings does Tang San have?

282
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,560
He is a Soul Sect.

283
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:31,959
He killed

284
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,759
a Decade Millennium Soul Beast
to get the Fourth Soul Ring.

285
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,639
Decade Millennium Demon Fox?

286
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,680
Go and advance to the Fourth Soul Ring.

287
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,839
This place seems
to be bigger than Tian Dou City.

288
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,079
Why is he the only one here?

289
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:19,040
Did we arrive early?

290
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:21,880
Why is the Grand Chrysanthemum Master here?

291
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,279
He is

292
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,079
the tournament host

293
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:25,880
sent by Martial Soul Hall to Tian Dou?

294
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,440
Right.

295
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:27,839
He was the one

296
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,279
who knocked out all of us that night.

297
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:30,839
Should we

298
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,320
do some tricks on him?

299
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:33,480
It's an eye for an eye.

300
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,240
You fool.

301
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,440
He is a Grand Soul Land Master
with Nine Soul Rings.

302
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,279
We might not be able to defeat him

303
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,399
even with all of our power combined.

304
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:40,159
A Grand Soul Land Master with Nine Soul Rings?

305
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,120
You've seen the Greatest City.

306
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,959
How is it? Are you thinking
of asking me to be your master?

307
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,759
Were you waiting here just to say that?

308
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,680
Tang San, come with me.

309
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:51,959
Why should he?

310
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,120
Someone wants to see him.

311
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:54,719
Who?

312
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,560
I'm afraid I can't tell you.

313
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
Then we can't do what you want.

314
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,800
This is Martial Soul City.

315
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,279
Everyone here

316
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,599
knows that Tang San leaves with me.

317
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:05,279
I will be responsible

318
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,199
if something happens to him.

319
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,120
Can you tell me

320
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,199
who wants to see me now?

321
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:36,680
The chief.

322
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,519
Why does she want
to see me personally?

323
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,399
Why don't you ask her yourself?

324
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:49,759
Does he have family members?

325
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,040
His wife, Bi Bi Dong, is the current chief.

326
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,880
And his daughter, Qian Ren Xue.

327
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,440
Why?

328
00:14:58,759 --> 00:14:59,800
You want to take revenge on them?

329
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,800
But they have nothing
to do with your mother's death.

330
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,639
Qian Xun Ji was the mastermind.

331
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,719
When he tried to kill my mother,

332
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,639
did he ever think about her child

333
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,839
and her husband?

334
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:12,560
One day,

335
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,279
if I really meet

336
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,320
those people from Martial Soul Hall,

337
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,399
I...

338
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:18,920
I really can't guarantee

339
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,440
that I will act rationally.

340
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,480
Tang San.

341
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,480
Hatred shouldn't be spread.

342
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:25,440
You shouldn't hate everyone

343
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,880
from Martial Soul Hall because of this.

344
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:28,680
Your mother would not wish

345
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,320
to see you live in hatred forever, would she?

346
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,320
Telling you the truth

347
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,480
doesn't mean I want you to take revenge.

348
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:39,599
On the contrary,

349
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,159
I hope that you won't have hatred in your heart.

350
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,399
You have your own mission and your path.

351
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,880
Don't be blinded by hatred

352
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,680
and let it ruin your life.

353
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,759
No way.

354
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,759
I have to remember my mother's words.

355
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,880
I mustn't be rash.

356
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,199
-I mustn't be rash...
-You will see the Chief

357
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:01,680
as you go up this way.

358
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:05,519
Are you not going in?

359
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,599
I'll wait for you here.

360
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,480
Hu Lie Na?

361
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,959
Show me your Soul Ring.

362
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:25,959
Soul Ring?

363
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,599
It really
is the Decade Millennium Soul Ring.

364
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,000
Didn't the chief want to see me?

365
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,399
Why is it only you here?

366
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,800
A Decade Millennium Soul Ring?

367
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,040
How can it be?

368
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,079
This doesn't make sense!

369
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,399
Isn't yours also
the Decade Millennium Soul Ring?

370
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:53,560
It was an exception

371
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,440
that I could absorb
the Decade Millennium Soul Ring.

372
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,880
What you can do,

373
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,800
Martial Soul Hall can do it as well.

374
00:16:58,759 --> 00:16:59,599
See you in the arena.

375
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:02,199
Are you a member
of Martial Soul Hall's Battle Team?

376
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,360
In the contest this time,

377
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,519
the champion can only be
Martial Soul Hall.

378
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,360
So, you guys organize the contest

379
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,800
to oppress all Soul Master Schools
in Douluo Continent?

380
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:17,999
You're leaving like this?

381
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:19,960
Didn't the Chief want to meet me?

382
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,600
Where is she?

383
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,879
Tang San.

384
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:31,639
You are the chief of Martial Soul Hall?

385
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:40,999
You...

386
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:49,800
What happened?

387
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,999
Why is my Martial Soul out of control?

388
00:17:56,999 --> 00:17:58,200
Blue Silver Plant?

389
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:00,720
What else?

390
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:08,879
I don't understand.

391
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,479
Why is the chief

392
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,239
so interested in Tang San?

393
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,080
Because of the Decade Millennium Soul Ring?

394
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:16,440
It has been proven

395
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:18,119
that she can do such a miracle too.

396
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:19,920
The Chief's wisdom is as profound as the sea.

397
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,879
To be honest, I can't

398
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,279
tell what she's thinking either.

399
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,200
If you want to see my Martial Soul,

400
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
just tell me.

401
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,479
There's no need to make a move yourself.

402
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,080
There should be more.

403
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,879
Twin Martial Souls. Hao Tian Hammer.

404
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:53,999
You're Tang Hao's son.

405
00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:56,040
You should know

406
00:18:56,879 --> 00:18:59,119
that your mother's Martial Soul
is Blue Silver Plant.

407
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,399
Therefore,

408
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,080
Twin Martial Souls

409
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,320
are your parents' gift to you.

410
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,720
Did you go after my parents as well?

411
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,200
Are you related to her death?

412
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:18,359
The former chief

413
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,759
was heavily injured and eventually died

414
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:22,600
because of your father.

415
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,920
Do you think

416
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,159
I should kill you now?

417
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,479
Hide your Hao Tian Hammer well.

418
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,680
Do not let anyone see it

419
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,359
during the contest.

420
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,680
What do you mean?

421
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,200
Back then,

422
00:19:47,639 --> 00:19:48,920
I was not involved in pursuing your mother.

423
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,999
Who else was involved?

424
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:52,960
Right now, you don't have the right to know.

425
00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:54,759
If I am able to survive,

426
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,560
I will pursue the matter to the end.

427
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,639
You can leave now.

428
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,200
See you in the arena.

429
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,639
Martial Soul Hall

430
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:27,759
has arranged the lodging

431
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:28,399
for every Soul Master.

432
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:28,960
It's huge.

433
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:29,759
This way, please.

434
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:31,560
I think I have an idea

435
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,040
about who wanted to see him.

436
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:34,680
That's why I'm worried.

437
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:36,040
Although nothing will happen

438
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,399
in Martial Soul City,

439
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,800
we still can't let our guard down.

440
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,440
How about this?

441
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:40,999
You take them there.

442
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:41,879
I'll go back and check it out.

443
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,440
-All right.
-I'm going with you.

444
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,639
Don't worry.

445
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,399
With me here, Tang San will be fine.

446
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,479
Wu.

447
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,680
Martial Soul City is huge.

448
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,720
You have to stay together with everyone.

449
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:50,879
If you get lost,

450
00:20:50,879 --> 00:20:51,920
Tang San will be worried.

451
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:52,759
She's right.

452
00:20:52,879 --> 00:20:54,040
Besides, I've also given him

453
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,600
the emergency fireworks.

454
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,359
If there is an emergency,

455
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:56,680
we'll use Rocketing Kiwi
and fly over there immediately.

456
00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:00,279
All right.

457
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:04,720
Let's go.

458
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,720
I'll take you to the lodging.

459
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,359
Let me do it instead.

460
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,840
I know him, after all.

461
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,320
You've returned as well.

462
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,639
The school representatives
from Xing Luo have all arrived.

463
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,879
Go and report it.

464
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:33,159
Let's chat later.

465
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,119
Let's go.

466
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,040
I'll show you around Martial Soul City.

467
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,759
You've returned.

468
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,840
The school representatives
from Xing Luo Empire

469
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,639
have arrived.

470
00:22:22,879 --> 00:22:23,720
So they've all arrived.

471
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,800
This is the schedule for the final.

472
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,960
Who was that person?

473
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,479
He is the Grand Ghost Master.

474
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,999
One of the Grand Soul Land Masters.

475
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,399
Another one with Nine Soul Rings?

476
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:45,879
He and the Grand Chrysanthemum Master
are very good friends.

477
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:47,720
He appeared

478
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:48,720
and disappeared in an instant.

479
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:50,600
But it didn't seem like Teleport.

480
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,479
His Martial Soul is called the Ghost.

481
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,920
Allegedly, it can

482
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,080
travel through the interspace.

483
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:57,159
The chief once mentioned

484
00:22:57,159 --> 00:22:58,639
that this type of Martial Soul
is most suited for assassination.

485
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:01,999
Do you remember...

486
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,159
Remember what?

487
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,159
Can we find a quiet place to talk?

488
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,279
My room is just ahead.

489
00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:22,680
This is my room.

490
00:23:22,879 --> 00:23:23,600
It's safe.

491
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:24,440
No one else knows about it.

492
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,600
Have a seat.

493
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,800
What did you want to talk about?

494
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,600
Do you remember Su Yun Tao's death?

495
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,800
In the Star Forest?

496
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:39,479
Master saw the murderer.

497
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,920
I'm sure he has told you

498
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,879
about the person's characteristics, right?

499
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,680
He's dead.

500
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,279
What did you say?

501
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,279
I saw him being killed in the Star Forest

502
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,840
with my own eyes.

503
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,560
Nonsense.

504
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,399
Who killed him?

505
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:54,600
It was a black shadow.

506
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,320
Didn't you also say

507
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,800
that the murderer was very likely

508
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,159
to be someone from Martial Soul Hall?

509
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:03,119
Why are you looking at me like that?

510
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:05,720
You suspect
the Grand Soul Land Master

511
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,159
of Martial Soul Hall

512
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:08,800
just because of a vague black shadow?

513
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:11,639
When Master was in the Star Forest,

514
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,519
he saw the murderer

515
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,720
meeting with Azure Bull Python.

516
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:18,080
The murderer was meeting

517
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:20,399
with Azure Bull Python in the Star Forest.

518
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:24,320
The King of Star Forest?

519
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,920
The murderer must have

520
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,960
killed Su Yun Tao

521
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,759
to silence him.

522
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:28,920
But the question is

523
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,600
that the black shadow's face couldn't be seen.

524
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,800
How could Su Yun Tao expose the secret meeting?

525
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,759
Are you suspecting the Grand Ghost Master?

526
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:40,680
This is impossible.

527
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,080
Why is it impossible?

528
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:44,960
Do you remember your speculation?

529
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,440
You mean

530
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:47,720
the murderer was very likely

531
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,119
to be someone Su Yun Tao was familiar with?

532
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:50,920
Yes.

533
00:24:51,639 --> 00:24:53,159
It's the only reason to kill Su Yun Tao.

534
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,040
How could Su Yun Tao

535
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,840
have recognized that person's identity

536
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,960
from a black shadow alone?

537
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:58,920
Unless he's very familiar with the murderer.

538
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:01,119
Su Yun Tao had no family member.

539
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,479
He has always lived in Martial Soul Hall.

540
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,519
If the murderer was someone he was familiar with,

541
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,359
it's very likely
to be someone from Martial Soul Hall.

542
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:09,279
Not only that,

543
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:11,159
but Master also witnessed

544
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:12,519
how the black smoke turned into a human form.

545
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,320
The time has come.

546
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:16,800
Have you made up your mind?

547
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:41,440
The conflicts between humans
have nothing to do with me.

548
00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:43,279
What do you think?

549
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,840
Don't you think it's familiar?

550
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,639
Martial Soul Hall
is not your Shi Lan Ke School.

551
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,639
Don't go around without permission.

552
00:25:56,879 --> 00:25:57,800
I want to see Bi Bi Dong.

553
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,800
You called the Chief by name.

554
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,759
Even the emperors of the two empires

555
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:02,840
dare not be so rude.

556
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,560
Let him in.

557
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:19,239
Get back to work.

558
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,519
Judging from the characteristics
of the Martial Soul,

559
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,040
he seems to be the murderer.

560
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,279
I think there is another possibility.

561
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,159
Tell me.

562
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,879
Didn't you always say

563
00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:52,399
that the Grand Soul Land Master behind Cang Hui

564
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:53,239
had ulterior motives?

565
00:26:53,999 --> 00:26:55,239
Wouldn't it be possible

566
00:26:55,479 --> 00:26:56,479
that he disguised himself
as the Grand Ghost Master

567
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:57,320
and killed Su Yun Tao?

568
00:26:58,879 --> 00:27:00,479
This idea of yours is groundless.

569
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,720
So is yours.

570
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,399
If you suspect Cang Hui,

571
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:05,080
why don't you ask them yourself?

572
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,800
Cang Hui is alert against Martial Soul Hall.

573
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,639
But it is open

574
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:10,519
towards Shi Lan Ke School.

575
00:27:11,639 --> 00:27:12,800
You can observe them secretly.

576
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:14,399
And tell me

577
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,680
if you find anything odd.

578
00:27:15,879 --> 00:27:17,200
Why should I help Martial Soul Hall?

579
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,759
We can discuss

580
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:20,879
the payment.

581
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:24,359
Back then,

582
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:27,080
I was not involved in pursuing your mother.

583
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,119
Who else was involved?

584
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,239
Right now, you don't have the right to know.

585
00:27:31,879 --> 00:27:32,720
Does Martial Soul Hall

586
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,519
have any yearly activity records
that can be checked?

587
00:27:34,879 --> 00:27:35,359
Yes.

588
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:38,440
They're usually kept

589
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,840
in Martial Soul City's library.

590
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,479
All right. I promise you.

591
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
I'll help you investigate Cang Hui.

592
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,680
In exchange, you let me enter the library

593
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,960
to check the archives from that year.

594
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,320
Which year?

595
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:51,560
Around ten years ago.

596
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:53,639
For what?

597
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,320
If you can't give me
a reasonable explanation,

598
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,639
I won't let you check them out.

599
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,399
I want to find out the relationship

600
00:28:03,639 --> 00:28:04,920
between my master and your chief.

601
00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:08,639
My master and your chief

602
00:28:08,639 --> 00:28:09,680
once had a relationship.

603
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:27,159
You are here.

604
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,960
You called me Bi Bi Dong.

605
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,720
If it weren't for you,

606
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,600
I'd have almost forgotten this name.

607
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:41,920
Tang San is my pupil.

608
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,800
I have to protect him.

609
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,119
Then, do you know

610
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,519
that he is Tang Hao's son?

611
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,560
You knew it.

612
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,080
But you didn't plan to tell me.

613
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:04,080
Where is he?

614
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,840
I let him go back.

615
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,519
Did you really let him go?

616
00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:08,159
Am I that narrow-minded

617
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,840
in your heart?

618
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,560
I spoke rashly.

619
00:29:12,479 --> 00:29:13,519
I won't disturb you any longer.

620
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,639
If it weren't for Tang San,

621
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,239
would you have come to see me?

622
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,399
You're the chief of Martial Soul Hall now.

623
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,720
I'm just an ordinary school teacher.

624
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,960
Do I have the right to see you?

625
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,399
I told you before.

626
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,320
Your brain is the most precious treasure.

627
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:37,159
Sometimes, I wonder...

628
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,479
what if

629
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:43,080
we didn't miss it.

630
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:47,519
There are no "what ifs" in this world.

631
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,920
But some regrets

632
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:50,759
can be mended.

633
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,960
I believe in your capabilities.

634
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,399
You're the best teacher in Douluo Continent.

635
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,279
With your help,

636
00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:03,800
we can let

637
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:06,440
Martial Soul Hall rise.

638
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,960
I will let everyone

639
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:11,720
know your name.

640
00:30:14,639 --> 00:30:15,840
Time has changed everything.

641
00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:19,560
It's all in the past.

642
00:30:20,239 --> 00:30:20,999
Do you understand?

643
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:22,920
Have you ever grieved

644
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,960
over what happened in the past?

645
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,359
The paths that we chose

646
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,359
were going to be different anyway.

647
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,720
You said that you would
let everyone know my name.

648
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:32,800
I don't need it.

649
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:34,239
Bi Bi Dong.

650
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,879
The things that we want are different.

651
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:39,279
Our paths will never cross.

652
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:49,759
Certain things...

653
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,119
should just stay in memory.

654
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,320
Take this.

655
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,800
With it, you'll be able
to look up the archives from that year.

656
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:32,279
I'll help you to keep an eye

657
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,040
on Cang Hui School.

658
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,519
Remember to give it back to me once you're done.

659
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,759
Got it.

660
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,200
Xie Yue?

661
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,759
Why are you here?

662
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,080
Who is he?

663
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,320
It's none of your business.

664
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:50,239
Go.

665
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,680
How dare you?

666
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,279
You gave him
your Martial Soul Token?

667
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,999
I just lent it to him.

668
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:10,359
What right does he have

669
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,440
to take your Martial Soul Token?

670
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,600
Return it to her.

671
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,720
I'm only borrowing the token temporarily.

672
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:17,639
And you already intend to hurt me?

673
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,359
Consider yourself lucky that you're not dead.

674
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,479
Don't hide behind a woman if you have guts.

675
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,320
Enough.

676
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:27,080
You go first.

677
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,800
If you want to stay and fight him,

678
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,759
then return the token to me.

679
00:32:39,239 --> 00:32:40,080
The chief has said

680
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:41,639
that personal duels are not
allowed before the contest.

681
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:45,119
Tell me your name and school.

682
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:48,759
Tang San, Shi Lan Ke School.

683
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,279
Xie Yue,
Captain of Martial Soul Hall's Battle Team.

684
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,479
Remember this name.

685
00:32:55,159 --> 00:32:56,399
If I see you in the arena,

686
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,119
I'll crush you with my own hands.

687
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,519
How could you guys

688
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:04,359
choose a lunatic to be the captain?

689
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:08,759
You'll have a miserable death.

690
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:30,759
Tang San!

691
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:32,920
Master.

692
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,119
Why are you here?

693
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,359
I was looking for you.

694
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,720
It's good that you're fine.

695
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,639
Let's go back to the lodging.

696
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:39,080
All right.

697
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:40,040
-Which way?
-Which way?

698
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,879
-You don't know?
-You don't know?

699
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:45,119
Master, this is my first time coming
to Martial Soul Hall.

700
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,479
I did come here before.

701
00:33:47,479 --> 00:33:48,479
But this place has been expanded.

702
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,800
It's quite different now.

703
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:54,680
So... we're lost?

704
00:33:56,639 --> 00:33:58,080
Theoretically speaking, yes.

705
00:33:58,879 --> 00:33:59,759
We'll find a way out somehow.

706
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:05,279
Let's try this way.

707
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:15,919
What are you doing?

708
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,719
You seem to be in trouble.

709
00:34:17,999 --> 00:34:19,040
Please give us orders.

710
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,919
We are at your service.

711
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:22,840
The token on your hand

712
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,919
has the authority to mobilize
various resources in Martial Soul Hall.

713
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,120
Can I enter the library with this?

714
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:29,800
Of course.

715
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,600
Did Hu Lie Na give this to you?

716
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,239
Yes.

717
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,479
I didn't expect

718
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:40,880
the chief's disciple
to have such an authority.

719
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,160
It can't be.

720
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,560
As far as I know, the hierarchy
in Martial Soul Hall is very strict.

721
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,719
It's impossible
for her to have this authority

722
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,040
by just being the chief's disciple.

723
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,479
This is almost equivalent

724
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:51,759
to the authority granted
to a Grand Soul Land Master.

725
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,199
But Hu Lie Na only has Quadruple Soul Rings.

726
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,759
This road is way too narrow.

727
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:00,120
Perhaps...

728
00:35:00,759 --> 00:35:03,239
Martial Soul Hall isn't that rich to fix the roads?

729
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,919
It's hard to walk on this road.

730
00:35:04,919 --> 00:35:05,759
I can fly freely in the air.

731
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,239
How about we just fly there?

732
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,279
Lower your voice, will you?

733
00:35:08,279 --> 00:35:09,040
We have to keep a low profile.

734
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,840
Tang San was immediately
called away when we arrived.

735
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:12,759
Probably,

736
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:14,560
someone is plotting against us.

737
00:35:43,479 --> 00:35:44,679
The participating battle teams are not
allowed to engage in personal fights.

738
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:45,439
He attacked first.

739
00:35:45,439 --> 00:35:47,160
I heard that you
have Quadruple Soul Rings now.
