<i>Episode 12</i>

15
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,390
I got an idea!

16
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,260
I got an idea!

17
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,110
Headmaster!

18
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,260
Are you all right?

19
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,190
I'm fine.

20
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,470
It's not his power.

21
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,830
His father passed it to him,

22
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,030
but he failed to control it.

23
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,030
That's why he became so strong.

24
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,790
The fire will keep burning

25
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,510
until the whole village
is turned into ashes.

26
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,940
Headmaster, can you put off the fire?

27
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,750
We have two choices,

28
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,580
wake Ma Hong Jun up,

29
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,470
or kill him.

30
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,400
It seems

31
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,440
it's harder to wake him up now.

32
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,600
If he doesn't wake up,

33
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,780
what could be the worst consequence?

34
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,660
He'll be dead too,

35
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,120
just like his father,

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,780
burning up his Martial Soul
and his life.

37
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,470
There will be nothing we can do.

38
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,320
You can stop him.

39
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,060
I can defeat him

40
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,120
and suppress him,

41
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,700
but I can't put off the fire.

42
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,550
Unless he's wakened.

43
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:43,820
Yes.

44
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,100
Tang San.

45
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,290
Tang San.

46
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,820
The flame of Evil Phoenix

47
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,740
will devour everything.

48
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,740
You can't hold on for long

49
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,340
with your current Soul Power.

50
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,490
Are you out of your mind?

51
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:14,740
He'll burn you to death!

52
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,210
Headmaster.

53
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,930
Respect others' decisions.

54
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,290
He's getting his rebirth.

55
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,460
Ma Hong Jun, wake up!

56
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,020
Ma Hong Jun, keep your Martial Soul,

57
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,260
or else you'll destroy
the whole village!

58
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:00,980
I don't care!

59
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,380
They killed my father!

60
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,620
They have lives too,

61
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,930
you can't decide their fate.

62
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:09,930
Furthermore,

63
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,490
if it continues,

64
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,900
you'll end up getting burnt too.

65
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,850
Listen to me, Ma Hong Jun.

66
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,980
Your father chose to burn himself

67
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,250
in order to pass you his Martial Soul,

68
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,740
not to destroy

69
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,660
his hope on you.

70
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,940
You must live well

71
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,740
with the power he gave you.

72
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,370
Embrace your potential

73
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,740
to create your own world!

74
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:36,690
You can't

75
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,500
and shouldn't give up!

76
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,250
Do you get it?

77
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,220
Listen to me, Ma Hong Jun.

78
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,530
You still have our back,

79
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,570
we can be brothers.

80
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,530
Headmaster and teachers
can be your fathers!

81
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,740
All right?

82
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,250
Hong Jun!

83
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,340
Keep your Martial Soul!

84
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,780
It's been put off!

85
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,500
The fire is been put off!

86
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,250
Hand over your special medicines.

87
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,740
Calm down!

88
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,370
Did you try to drug me just now?

89
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,530
How about you try mine now?

90
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:53,530
Don't!

91
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,460
I'll get it.

92
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,220
Don't kill me.

93
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:55,850
Hurry up.

94
00:05:58,970 --> 00:05:59,970
That's all I have.

95
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,570
Where did you get this?

96
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,970
I prescribed it.

97
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,500
What are the ingredients?
How did you prescribe it?

98
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,060
Actually, someone gave it to me.

99
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,340
Who has eaten it?

100
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,690
Everyone in the village.

101
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,020
After they've eaten it,

102
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,620
they became weaker

103
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,660
and more obedient.

104
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,810
Who gave it to you?

105
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,530
A guy named Bu Le.

106
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,220
Where's he?

107
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,290
I have no idea!

108
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,460
I'm telling the truth!

109
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,130
He came to me

110
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,250
and gave me the medicine.

111
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,370
How did he know

112
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,320
you're experimenting for
Mutant Soul?

113
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,770
He said

114
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,080
he has already investigated

115
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,010
most descendants of Old Soul Masters.

116
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:47,680
He gave this medicine

117
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,450
not only to our villagers,

118
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,240
but also people in other areas.

119
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,610
He said he's helping

120
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,120
those fallen Soul Masters to revival.

121
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:57,450
This is the posture.

122
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,080
Revival!

123
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,120
The guy named Bu Le

124
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,210
just gave the medicine to you

125
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,080
and didn't ask for anything
in return?

126
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,170
That's right!

127
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,610
He said,

128
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,240
if any Soul Master
has successfully mutated,

129
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:10,680
they can go to

130
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,280
the Suo Tuo Soul Arena.

131
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,330
Does that mean

132
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,960
we can find him at Soul Arena?

133
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,610
Not really.

134
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,610
He said,

135
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,280
let the Mutant Soul Masters
take part in battles.

136
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,400
If they're strong enough,

137
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,400
he'll come and look for us again.

138
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,360
I'll let you handle this.

139
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:44,840
Wait.

140
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:51,930
Mutant Soul

141
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:52,890
has always been a tough issue

142
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,120
to handle for Martial Soul Hall.

143
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,960
Since your medicine is so precious,

144
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,450
why don't you sell it to me?

145
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,560
Just name your price.

146
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
What're you going to do with it?

147
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,960
I'll send it for research
in Martial Soul Hall.

148
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,770
Let's see if we can disseminate it.

149
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,680
Haven't you seen

150
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,680
what it has caused

151
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,240
to Ma Hong Jun's father?

152
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,400
This medicine is definitely evil.

153
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,400
That's why the research has to continue.

154
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,960
Declining bloodline
in Nightfire Village

155
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,450
happens at many places too
in Douluo Continent.

156
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,210
Maybe this medicine can really

157
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,680
allow them to rise again.

158
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,450
No way.

159
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,560
The Martial Soul Hall can offer

160
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,490
a price that you can never imagine.

161
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,610
I don't want any of that.

162
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:30,770
What do you want?

163
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,680
Power, status,

164
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,360
or enrolment in Martial Soul Hall?

165
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,360
What do you want?

166
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,160
I want nothing.

167
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,330
If it was not because of it,

168
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,530
my father wouldn't die.

169
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,010
Any price

170
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,210
won't bring back my father anymore.

171
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,010
I could feel my father's pain.

172
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,560
I believe

173
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,890
he wouldn't want more people

174
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,040
to feel what he did.

175
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,800
That's what I thought.

176
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,770
What's your plan afterwards?

177
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,970
I'm going to Suo Tuo City.

178
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,920
You're going to look for Bu Le?

179
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,210
I haven't made up my mind yet.

180
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,480
It's on our route,

181
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:37,650
why don't you follow us?

182
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,850
How dare you ask me this?

183
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:41,770
That's right.

184
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:42,450
Master!

185
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,970
Master!

186
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:45,890
You're back?

187
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,720
Master,

188
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,160
your Martial Soul theory
has been overturned.

189
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,890
By who?

190
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,010
Him.

191
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,890
What about me?

192
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,560
Didn't you say Soul Ring

193
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,290
can only be evolved by

194
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,480
hunting down Soul Beasts?

195
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:03,560
That's right.

196
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,720
Just now

197
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,240
while we were in inner space,

198
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,600
Ma Jun Hong already has
Double Soul Rings

199
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,720
when his Martial Soul is awakened.

200
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,850
There's only one possibility.

201
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,770
He was born with Double Soul Rings.

202
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,330
But once he has gotten his power,

203
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,240
it mutated.

204
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,120
Right.

205
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,330
I was born with Double Soul Rings.

206
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,210
Before this, it was Plymouth Rock,

207
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,290
now it's Phoenix.

208
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,480
I rather have my father here

209
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,330
than any mutations.

210
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,040
What your father has done

211
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,360
is to make sure you can live well.

212
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,530
Tang San,

213
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,160
you did great this time.

214
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,480
I didn't do anything,

215
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:50,210
If it wasn't you,

216
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,890
I might not be able to wake up at all.

217
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,330
Headmaster.

218
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,720
Ma Hong Jun has nowhere to go,

219
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,530
can he stay here?

220
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,650
Would you like to be Soul Master too?

221
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,090
Can I?

222
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,330
Mutant Soul itself

223
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,360
is a strong starting point.

224
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:13,800
Just pay your fees.

225
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,890
Fees?

226
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,330
Fees for Shi Lan Ke School.

227
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,410
Fifty Gold Soul Coins.

228
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,240
I don't have so much money.

229
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,920
You do have some
living expenses, right?

230
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,680
My house is burnt,

231
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:29,890
I'm now

232
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,770
penniless.

233
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,920
Why do I always meet unlucky people?

234
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,770
It's okay. Just follow us.

235
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,040
Hong Jun.

236
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,120
Well,

237
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,480
after you graduate
and have the capability,

238
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,650
are you willing to help the school?

239
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,850
Yes.

240
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:55,800
Enough, father.

241
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,720
All right.

242
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,010
Let's go back to the school then.

243
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,240
All right.

244
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,650
Ou Si Ke,

245
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,890
clean it up.

246
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,800
Make sure it's clean.

247
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,240
Let's go, back to the school.

248
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,010
Why me...

249
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:06,920
Let's go.

250
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,410
Here, Hong Jun.

251
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:21,890
Hong Jun,

252
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,010
this is the male dorm.

253
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,040
This is my bed,

254
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,650
Brother Dai's,

255
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,480
and Tang San's.

256
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,090
You can choose one from the rest.

257
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,330
Close the window before you leave.

258
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,560
It's all dusty.

259
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,920
There's a well at the door.

260
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:34,890
But if you wash it now,

261
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:35,850
it won't be dry by night.

262
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,600
Why is our school

263
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,560
in the village?

264
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,120
The rent here is cheap!

265
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,010
If we help out their farm works,

266
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,040
we can even get discounts!

267
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,720
So, the school

268
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,240
isn't that rich after all?

269
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,770
That I must disagree.

270
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,970
You're being too polite.

271
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,040
We're utterly poor!

272
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,120
I heard there are allowances
for Soul Masters.

273
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,720
There are three ways

274
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,850
for a Soul Master to get his allowance.

275
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,290
Offer your service to the Empire,

276
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,770
join the Seven Tribes

277
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,770
or seek refuge in Martial Soul Hall.

278
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:06,890
The same goes with the school,

279
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,560
we have to depend on this wealthy power

280
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,650
in order to get financial support.

281
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,920
You'll know after looking at our school,

282
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,360
we don't stand with any side.

283
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,210
Not belonging under any power,

284
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,410
that's the real freedom.

285
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,290
Only by breaking restraints

286
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,850
can students learn

287
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,770
to choose their own paths while growing.

288
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,480
What he said has some points.

289
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,360
Indeed,

290
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,290
but we can't even afford
to eat meat now.

291
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:27,920
Brother San!

292
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,720
Wu, Headmaster.

293
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,120
Wu, you brought so much stuff!

294
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,800
Here, give it to me.

295
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,410
Ma Hong Jun.

296
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,890
Which bed are you sleeping at?

297
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:37,800
That one.

298
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,040
All these are for you.

299
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,920
For me?

300
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,530
Not for you, but borrowing them to you.

301
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,120
You have to pay after you earn money.

302
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,160
Little Freak,

303
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,530
since you've joined Shi Lan Ke,

304
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,160
just treat here as your home.

305
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,210
We're all your family members.

306
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,650
This is Dai Mu Bai,

307
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,360
he's your boss.

308
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,040
You all are elder than him,

309
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,010
guide him more.

310
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,120
-All right.
-I'm good at this.

311
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,330
I'll protect you from now on.

312
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,450
Good kid.

313
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,330
Tang San and Wu,

314
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,040
come with me.

315
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,360
Master and I have something to tell you.

316
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:08,770
Just the both of us?

317
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,290
All right.

318
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,240
Hurry and come.

319
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:14,890
Let's go.

320
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,010
We'll make a move first.

321
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,890
Where's the well?

322
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:29,680
Well?

323
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,120
You're washing his bedsheet

324
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,450
just to thank him for saving you?

325
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,600
I saved you too at that time.

326
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,040
I was the one who put off the fire!

327
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:41,800
Have you forgotten?

328
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,040
Let me remind you then.

329
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,290
Look, at that time,

330
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,920
Tang San and you were in the fire.

331
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,450
I took such a big barrel of water

332
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,720
and walked so far,

333
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,410
then...

334
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:57,330
I don't get it.

335
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,040
The fire is off.

336
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,330
And then?

337
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,890
And then I saved you.

338
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,090
Don't you think you should thank me too?

339
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,120
Right?

340
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,040
Thank you.

341
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,010
You're being too polite,

342
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:09,650
we all are a family.

343
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:09,920
Come here,

344
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,210
boy.

345
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,560
Wash my bedsheet too.

346
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,160
Why must he help you?

347
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,240
Everyone has been helping
during this mission,

348
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,800
even our observer, Hu Lie Na

349
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,600
provided us information.

350
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,330
Except you.

351
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,210
Not only you were first captivated,

352
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,410
others even have to save you.

353
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,450
I...

354
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,290
I helped

355
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,480
splashing water!

356
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:24,970
Everyone saw that.

357
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,090
The Evil Fire is
Ma Hong Jun's Martial Soul.

358
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,210
Do you think your water can put it off?

359
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,040
Either you're being silly after years
becoming Soul Master,

360
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,970
or it's because you've been writing
too many opera lines.

361
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,680
From your professional perspective,

362
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,850
even if you're making stories,

363
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,770
you have to consider it rationality.

364
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,360
I have

365
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,240
records here!

366
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,010
They are all being recorded here!

367
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:39,970
Look.

368
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,920
I wrote how did I question
that village head

369
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
and draw something out of him.

370
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,090
It's impossible that

371
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,480
I make up these dialogues, right?

372
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,240
Look at it!

373
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,600
You shouldn't neglect my contribution

374
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,410
just because I'm a writer.

375
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,450
All right,

376
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,800
just live in your own world.

377
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,530
What do you mean?

378
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,450
Where's he?

379
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,890
He has already left.

380
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,970
Hurry and take a look at him.

381
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,090
Me?

382
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,090
Hurry up.

383
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,480
Stop being so mean to me next time.

384
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,450
Headmaster

385
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,600
has informed the City Main Office
about the Nightfire Village incident.

386
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,090
If the officers are investigating it,

387
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,120
then both of you
shouldn't bother anymore.

388
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,450
Also,

389
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,560
take good care of Ma Hong Jun.

390
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,090
Don't let him do anything impulsive.

391
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:19,680
Got it.

392
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:20,770
Oh, right.

393
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,920
You should always keep a distance
from Hu Lie Na,

394
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,600
after all she's from
the Martial Soul Hall.

395
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,160
Xiao Gang, I've already told you.

396
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,920
She came here for Dai Mu Bai.

397
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,480
What's the use of reminding him?

398
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:31,530
Oh, right.

399
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,210
There's another frosty lady.

400
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,290
I can't believe she's...

401
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,040
What did you say, Wu?

402
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,600
Her name is Zhu Zhu Qing.

403
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,160
I still think

404
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,480
Hu Lie Na's motive isn't that simple.

405
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,240
She must be hiding something from us.

406
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,410
Enough.

407
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,410
Both of you go back first.

408
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,360
We'll make a move first then, teacher.

409
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:57,650
I wanted to say

410
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,600
Sister Qing is Brother Dai's fiancee.

411
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,680
I know.

412
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,120
But that's others' secret,

413
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,970
let's not mind it.

414
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,560
You scared me.

415
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,200
Come here.

416
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,170
Put them down.

417
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:14,930
Come.

418
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,320
What is it?

419
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,440
Are you interested in acting?

420
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:20,810
Acting?

421
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:21,570
Right.

422
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,650
I feel that your life experience

423
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,320
is extremely dramatic.

424
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,770
I'll write the lines

425
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:27,650
and you act.

426
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,480
When you set yourself on fire,

427
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,170
I'm sure the audience
will like it very much!

428
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,080
On fire?

429
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,810
That's right.

430
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,050
You have to learn to release

431
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,360
and keep your Martial Soul
at your wish.

432
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,650
This isn't even close to perfect.

433
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,010
You should train more

434
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,690
so as to practice with me.

435
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,410
Did you get it?

436
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,200
At that time, you'll get

437
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,320
half of the profits.

438
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,690
The school is too poor now.

439
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,890
We should think of

440
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,170
a way for us to survive.

441
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,320
All right.

442
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,410
Oh, Brother Ou.

443
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,650
What's your Martial Soul?

444
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,240
My Martial Soul...

445
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,440
My Martial Soul...

446
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,570
is just that.

447
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,360
Well...

448
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,890
There's not much use for
Support Branch Martial Soul.

449
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,480
It's absolutely useless.

450
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,170
Who said so?

Don't you know that

453
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,080
the Qibao Amber Clan,

454
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,010
one of the top three tribes
of the Seven tribes

455
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,320
belongs to the Support Branch?

456
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,410
I'm talking to you.

457
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,010
I'm talking to you!

458
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:51,810
Your voice is so nice.

459
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,360
Is this Shi Lan Ke School?

460
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,320
Do you know where is the headmaster?

461
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,290
I'll lead the way.

462
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,530
This is heavy.

463
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,170
I'll do it if you can't take it.

464
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,080
I can.

465
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,080
Hello.

466
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,120
Why isn't he responding?

467
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,440
Is he crazy?

468
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,600
Luckily I didn't ask him
to wash my bedsheet.

469
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,010
I have nothing to do with this.

470
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:18,890
He set himself on fire.

471
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,410
I have to take the box.

472
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,170
No, I should look for someone.

473
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,290
I'll look for someone.

474
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,810
Ma Hong Jun.

475
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,320
Such a young Soul Honour?

476
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,810
What Martial Soul is this?

477
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:37,440
Fire Flamingo?

478
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:40,650
Burning Sparrow?

479
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,120
It doesn't look like a Phoenix.

480
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,770
Don't.

481
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,600
I'm sorry.

482
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:00,840
What happened to him?

483
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,120
Why was he out of control suddenly?

484
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,410
I have no idea too.

485
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:04,840
A girl who was looking for Headmaster

486
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,810
greeted him,

487
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:06,770
look what happened to him.

488
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:07,650
It should be

489
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,930
the defect from the mutation
of Martial Soul.

490
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,440
He was just temporarily out of control.

491
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,770
Will this happen again in the future?

492
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:14,570
It might.

493
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,810
It's all right.

494
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,080
He'll recover once his power is used up.

495
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,440
Take good care of him.

496
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,170
Take good care of him.

497
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:23,930
Okay.

498
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,240
This kid.

499
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,170
That means he's a time bomb.

500
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,320
So we'll have to be prepared

501
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,290
to fight him when the time comes?

502
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,360
I...

503
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,480
Not bad.

504
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,120
We can train our resilience.

505
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,080
Re...

506
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,810
Brother, I'm of the Support Branch.

507
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,170
What should I do then?

508
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,690
You can practice to restrain
from the flame.

509
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,360
How do I...

510
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,290
What Brother Dai meant was,

511
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,410
you'll get used to be burnt.

512
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,200
Please remind me

513
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,440
not to spend time alone with him.

514
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:56,410
Where are you going?

515
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,010
I'll check out that lady.

516
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:58,930
She must be frightened now.

517
00:20:59,050 --> 00:20:59,810
I'll leave first.

518
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,770
Is the school inside the jungle?

519
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,650
This is the school.

520
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,120
This is the school?

521
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,050
Where's the gate?

522
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,890
The walls?

523
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:16,930
The dorms?

524
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,320
Where's the stadium?

525
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:20,570
None.

526
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,010
You don't have any of those?

527
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,720
If there's no dorm,

528
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,960
then where the students stay?

529
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,570
Look.

530
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:28,810
That's the boys' dorm,

531
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,650
and there's the girls'.

532
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,240
Just two wooden houses?

533
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:33,570
Is it sufficient?

534
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,050
How many students are there?

535
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,770
How many?

536
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,810
Let me count.

537
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,050
Six!

538
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,080
Just six students in a school?

539
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:45,650
Little girl!

540
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:48,810
I heard that you're looking for me.

541
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,170
You're the headmaster?

542
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:51,840
Yes.

543
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,690
You're the Soul Saint
with Seven Soul Rings?

544
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,360
Who told you so?

545
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,600
What's your name?

546
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,720
Lander.

547
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,890
That's right.

548
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,200
This is the letter from my father.

549
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,650
You're Ning Feng Zhi's daughter?

550
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,080
Do you know him?

551
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,010
Do you know the Seven Clans?

552
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,930
Of course I do.

553
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,200
It's formed by

554
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,960
the seven most powerful clans.

555
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,930
Even the Martial Soul Hall
and the Empire

556
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,010
dare not provoke them.

557
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:29,930
Among the Seven tribes,

558
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,930
the top three are called three elders,

559
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,810
the Qibao Amber Clan is one of them.

560
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:34,690
And for this term,

561
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,440
the head of the Qibao Amber Clan

562
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:37,480
is Ning Feng Zhi.

563
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,440
Does that mean

564
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,600
you're the princess of
the Qibao Amber Clan?

565
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,690
Did your father ask you to
join the Shi Lan Ke School?

566
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:47,650
I've even brought my luggage.

567
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,080
This year's enrolment has ended.

568
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,440
Come again next year.

569
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,530
Are you going to reject

570
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,770
such a pretty lady?

571
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,200
I didn't expect Headmaster
to hold still on his principles.

572
00:22:58,770 --> 00:22:59,840
My father also said,

573
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,530
as long as I'm in,

574
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:02,890
your debt to the Qibao Amber Clan

575
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,010
will be canceled out.

576
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,650
Wu,

577
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,890
hurry and bring our new girl

578
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,440
to the dorm

579
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,930
and familiarise her
with the environment.

580
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,120
Let me do it.

581
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:18,930
Hello, Junior.

582
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:19,770
I'm Ou Si Ke,

583
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,480
your senior.

584
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:22,320
Just let me know if you need any help.

585
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,240
I'm Ning Rong Rong.

586
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,290
Rong Rong.

587
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,480
What a cute name.

588
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,290
Rong Rong!

589
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,120
What are you looking at?

590
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,690
We owed them a huge amount.

591
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,360
The school isn't doing well recently.

592
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:42,770
Come back and gather here

593
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,600
in half an hour.

594
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,960
Be careful. Careful.

595
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,690
Are we in a rush of training?

596
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,570
I haven't finished cleaning up my room.

597
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,530
Since your father is being sincere,

598
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,810
I must put more effort

599
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,960
into teaching you too.

600
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,690
Both of you are
Support Branch Soul Masters,

601
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,290
so you can practice together.

602
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,360
What's your Martial Soul?

603
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,200
Ou Si Ke.

604
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:08,600
Let me ask you.

605
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,480
What's the important role

606
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,480
of a Support Branch Soul Master
during a battle?

607
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,930
Protect ourselves.

608
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,170
Protect ourselves.

609
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:14,840
That's right.

610
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,290
Most Support Branch Soul Masters
aren't skillful in fighting,

611
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,810
so their first job
is to avoid danger.

612
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,570
A Support Branch Soul Master who
doesn't know how to escape

613
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,120
is considered a bad Soul Master.

614
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,600
Let me ask you, Ou Si Ke.

615
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,200
What's most important in escaping?

616
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,410
Long legs.

617
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,050
It's stamina!

618
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,170
Correct!

619
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,290
It's stamina.

620
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,050
Stamina.

621
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,440
An extra step in the crucial moment

622
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,690
will save you from being killed.

623
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,410
So, you must first complete
the stamina training.

624
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:38,840
From now on,

625
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,570
run 20 rounds around the village.

626
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,410
Finish up before the sky goes dark.

627
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,770
You can use your Martial Soul.

628
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,200
Should we start running now?

629
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,480
From where do we start?

630
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:49,770
Ou Si Ke knows that.

631
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:51,570
Right.

632
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,480
Just follow me.

633
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,080
Let's go.

634
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,010
Hurry up.

635
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:14,690
Let me ask you,

636
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,690
how far is one round?

637
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,080
Let me be frank,

638
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,240
it's considered lucky

639
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,120
if we can finish up before dinner.

640
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:20,890
What?

641
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,050
Do we have to keep running until dinner?

642
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,240
That's right.

643
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,720
Don't stop. Hurry up and run.

644
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,200
Or else we'll really miss the dinner.

645
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,120
Tell me honestly,

646
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,320
is that one man picking up bones on me?

647
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,960
Why did he punish me with this?

648
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:31,770
No,

649
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,320
this is how we train normally.

650
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,600
Why training stamina?

651
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:36,570
Because

652
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,360
as a Support Branch Soul Master,

653
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,720
you'll have to know how to run.

654
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,320
Why run?

655
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,050
If there's really a battle,

656
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,080
the Combat Branch Soul Masters

657
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,010
should fully protect us

658
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:46,840
from the Support Branch.

659
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,720
But during a battle,

660
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,170
you should learn how to
protect yourself.

661
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,570
Where's Suo Tuo City?

662
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,600
The city is that way.

663
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,720
Where are you going?

664
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:00,890
Shopping.

665
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,120
We haven't even
finished running one round here.

666
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,200
No one is checking on us,

667
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:04,960
who would know?

668
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:06,440
You...

669
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,050
How's that?

670
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:07,840
Are you following me?

671
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:09,890
I...

672
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:14,120
Hey.

673
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,200
Hong Jun.

674
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,050
What are you doing?

675
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,120
I...

676
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,770
I'll just lock myself up.

677
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,890
So, next time when I'm out of control,

678
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,600
I won't hurt you all anymore.

679
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:36,650
This is not necessary.

680
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:38,600
Brother San,

681
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,890
do you think my Martial Soul
can be controllable?

682
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:48,600
Surely it can.

683
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,240
If I fail to control my Martial Soul,

684
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,440
then my father died for nothing.

685
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:00,410
It'd be good if
my Martial Soul wasn't mutated.

686
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,120
Let bygone be bygone.

687
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,480
You have to learn to accept it.

688
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,720
At least you have the power now

689
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:05,960
and hope to be stronger.

690
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,050
But is this what he wants?

691
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,360
Whatever he wants,

692
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,440
he'll have it after becoming stronger.

693
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,290
You mean,

694
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,080
he can have everything when he's strong?

695
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,810
That's how the world runs.

696
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,360
What can you do about it?

697
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,120
What are you trying to do?

698
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:26,930
When I was in despair,

699
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,240
Brother San was the one
who lent me a hand.

700
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,050
So, is all his words right?

701
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,440
Will you fight

702
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,690
whoever quarrels with him?

703
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,240
Not all arguments

704
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,440
have to be solved by fists.

705
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,290
Then what?

706
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:43,530
By your mouth?

707
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,960
If we only value a person through
their strength and not the truth,

708
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,480
then the world will be terrible.

709
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,050
That's the reality.

710
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,480
What can you do about it?

711
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,690
If it's really like this,

712
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,010
then I'll change it.

713
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,320
I really would like to see

714
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:58,840
whether you change the world,

715
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,480
or the world changes you.

716
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,930
My Martial Soul is a Ghost Cat.

717
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:19,320
Speed means everything.

718
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,200
That's why I need a pair
of comfortable shoes.

719
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,320
Later on,

720
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,290
I'll polish the sole.

721
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:25,200
In this way,

722
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,770
I can walk without any noises.

723
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,960
You're considerate about it.

724
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,320
In order to give full play
of Martial Soul,

725
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,200
we should consider every aspect.

726
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:35,360
It takes time to become stronger.

727
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,010
Are you doing that
to defeat Brother Dai?

728
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,960
Not so much as defeating Dai Mu Bai,

729
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,290
but challenging my own fate.

730
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:49,930
I don't wish to live
a well-planned life,

731
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,690
I need to set myself free.

732
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:54,600
So, I must be stronger.

733
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,360
Defeating Dai Mu Bai,

734
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,570
is just my first target.

735
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,240
I want to be stronger too,

736
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,050
I want to free myself too.

737
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:07,530
What's your target then?

738
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,050
I'm going to win Headmaster.

739
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:12,650
Why?

740
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:14,720
Defeating him

741
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,080
means I can change
the school rules.

742
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,360
Then I can enter the boys' dorm!

743
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,290
Wu, you're still young.

744
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,050
Don't get cheated.

745
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,240
By who?

746
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,010
My sister told me,

747
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:29,810
girls have to learn to be independent

748
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,170
and live for ourselves.

749
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,360
Men are unreliable.

750
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:33,930
But I feel

751
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,290
Tang San is a reliable man.

752
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,290
Even though Ou Si Ke isn't that good,

753
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,720
but Brother Dai isn't that bad too.

754
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:42,890
What's so good about him?

755
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,480
Every day he's flirting
with that Hu Lie Na.

756
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:48,720
Hu Lie Na?

757
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:50,960
Oh, right.

758
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,650
Headmaster told us just now

759
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,410
that Hu Lie Na came to Shi Lan Ke

760
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,600
for Brother Dai.

761
00:29:58,570 --> 00:29:59,290
Really?

762
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,360
What happened?

763
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,080
No idea.

764
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,200
Headmaster told us to come.

765
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,840
I almost died running.

766
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,010
Oh, right.

767
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,690
Where's the new girl?

768
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,170
New girl?

769
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:27,600
She...

770
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,960
There she is.

771
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,320
You both finished running so soon?

772
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:33,770
I...

773
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:34,840
That's right. We finished.

774
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,960
But you don't look tired at all.

775
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,290
I have good stamina.

776
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:45,600
I didn't get to
introduce myself properly

777
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,690
this afternoon.

778
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,650
Hello, I'm Ning Rong Rong.

779
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,170
I'm Wu.

780
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,120
Zhu Zhu Qing.

781
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,050
Why did you come to Shi Lan Ke School?

782
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:53,810
I don't know.

783
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,960
You don't know?

784
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:55,720
Yes.

785
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,170
My father gave me a letter

786
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:57,960
to ask me to come to Shi Lan Ke.

787
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:58,840
Here I come.

788
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,290
How about you all?

789
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,170
I came here with Tang San.

790
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,200
Ou Si Ke.

791
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,570
All of you, come over here.

792
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:08,890
Headmaster.

793
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,360
Ou Si Ke.

794
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,650
I told you both to run 20 rounds,

795
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:18,360
have you finished it?

796
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:19,650
I've finished it.

797
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,050
I said you both,

798
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:24,410
not only you.

799
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,410
We finished also.

800
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,600
Great.

801
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,570
You now know teamwork now too.

802
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,410
Run another 20 rounds.

803
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:35,240
Why?

804
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,930
Because

805
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,480
he lied.

806
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,320
You didn't finish the 20 rounds.

807
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,690
Who said so?

808
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:42,570
How did you know?

809
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,410
I also know that
you went to Suo Tuo City,

810
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,960
shopped at three jewelry shops,

811
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,690
eaten dessert in the city west,

812
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,890
and watched the street circus.

813
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:51,690
Did you follow me?

814
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:52,890
No.

815
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,080
I'm Headmaster,

816
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,200
I'm responsible towards
every student here.

817
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,650
I called you all here

818
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,810
to make sure you all remember,

819
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,240
no matter how tough the course is,

820
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:03,720
never run away from it.

821
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,320
Don't even lie to me.

822
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,960
Why are you still standing there?

823
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,170
You don't need to run.

824
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,360
He lied in order to help me.

825
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,440
He didn't do anything wrong.

826
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:17,320
This isn't his fault.

827
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,690
If lying can be forgiven,

828
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,080
then what about you?

829
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,050
Leaving the school without permission,

830
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,320
ignoring the teacher's order,

831
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,200
you even asked your friend
to lie for you.

832
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,480
If this was a battle,

833
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,600
Ou Si Ke might die because of you.

834
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,840
Actually, it isn't her fault too.

835
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,080
This isn't a battleground,

836
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:36,530
it's just a school.

837
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,170
But this is my school.

838
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,480
I give you two choices.

839
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,050
Leave the school

840
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,890
and return to the Qibao Amber Clan.

841
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:46,480
Your performance

842
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:48,720
proves that you don't deserve
to be a member of us.

843
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:50,050
Another option,

844
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:53,890
prove to me that you are fit to stay.

845
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,050
This is too much!

846
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,080
Lander,

847
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,810
you're just a little Soul Saint.

848
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:58,890
Do you know

849
00:32:58,890 --> 00:32:59,690
how many Soul Saints are there

850
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:00,530
in the Qibao Amber Clan?

851
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:01,810
They don't even worth

852
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:02,650
to be my teacher!

853
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,080
You're right.

854
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,600
I'm just a little Soul Saint.

855
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,810
And you,

856
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:07,810
if I'm not mistaken,

857
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:08,770
you're just a

858
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,960
Soul Master with Double Soul Rings.

859
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,010
I'm the greatest talent
among my generation

860
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,290
in the Qibao Amber Clan.

861
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,290
Talent?

862
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,170
Then I must say

863
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,240
this generation of the Qibao Amber Clan

864
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,570
is really disappointing.

865
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,360
How dare you humiliate our Ning family?

866
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,690
You said you're the greatest,

867
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:24,770
that's why I'm telling the truth.

868
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:25,930
Let me tell you,

869
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:26,720
every student here

870
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,810
is stronger than you.

871
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:28,600
Impossible.

872
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:30,650
Dai Mu Bai,

873
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:32,320
his Martial Soul is White Tiger.

874
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,120
He's the youngest Soul Honour

875
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,200
in the history of Shi Lan Ke.

876
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,770
He's quite strong,

877
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,570
but that's only one of them.

878
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:40,890
Tang San.

879
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,120
Not even a year after
his Martial Soul is awakened,

880
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:44,170
he's already the same as you,

881
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,650
a Soul Master with Double Soul Rings.

882
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,570
His Soul Power is so pure and condensed,

883
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,480
almost reaching
the level of a Soul Honour.

884
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,320
Soul Master with a year of experience?

885
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,930
That's impossible.

886
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:54,930
Show her.

887
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,690
Your Martial Soul is awakened
for only a year?

888
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,290
Less than that.

889
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,240
Zhu Zhu Qing.

890
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:16,570
A soul Master with
Double Soul Rings like you.

891
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,050
But I'm not as talented as them,

892
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:20,640
I'm still working my way up.

893
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:22,770
Her Soul Power is alike with yours,

894
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,290
but she has

895
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,370
the most determined heart

896
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,680
among all of you.

897
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:27,810
Let me ask you,

898
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:29,440
what's your purpose in the school?

899
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,440
To become stronger.

900
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,680
What would you do

901
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,480
for all the arrangements by the school?

902
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:34,680
As long as I can become stronger,

903
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,530
I'll carry it out with
no hesitation.

904
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,370
What if it'll burn your face

905
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,770
or get your hands chopped off?

906
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:40,530
If that's necessary,

907
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,680
I'll accept it.

908
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,010
What about him?

909
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,200
Ma Hong Jun?

910
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,010
You should have seen
when he's out of control.

911
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:49,960
Flame Soul.

912
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:50,720
That's right.

913
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:51,570
His Martial Soul

914
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,610
is the Evil Phoenix,
found once in a blue moon.

915
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:54,810
Liar!

916
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,880
Ma Hong Jun, show your Martial Soul!

917
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,810
Calm down!

918
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,610
All of us can prove that.

919
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,050
Once his Martial Soul forms,

920
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,440
his body will be on fire

921
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,290
and you'll see the Phoenix tail.

922
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,770
That's the Evil Phoenix.

923
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:09,810
Also,

924
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,400
didn't you already
witness that this afternoon?

925
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,370
If what they said is true,

926
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:15,810
then many clans

927
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:16,850
should be looking up for you.

928
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,010
I feel good being here.

929
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:23,770
I only have one Soul Ring.

930
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,130
Besides Wu,

931
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,640
everyone else here is stronger than you.

932
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:31,570
What about him?

933
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,480
He can't be stronger than me!

934
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,850
Of course.

935
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:35,640
I'm no match to you.

936
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,920
I suppose your Martial Soul is

937
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,400
Qibao Amber Pagoda.
