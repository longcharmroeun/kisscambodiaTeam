<i>Episode 10</i>

15
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,030
Still, I would like to try.

16
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:45,790
I'll accompany you.

17
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:46,990
You two,

18
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:47,940
go quickly.

19
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,660
Nobody is here.

20
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,070
What is it?

21
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,350
The village head just said

22
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,380
Ma Hong Jun's father

23
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,740
had been burned to death too.

24
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,590
Yes.

25
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,070
But there is

26
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,100
no new grave here.

27
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,900
He wasn't buried here?

28
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:33,990
Let's look again back in the village.

29
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,260
Sir,

30
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,620
do you know where's Ma Hong Jun?

31
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,950
Thank you.

32
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,430
Search on your own.

33
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,740
Don't disturb me.

34
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,540
You...

35
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,660
The villager doesn't seem to know much.

36
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,150
It seems like

37
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,990
you've been staring at those chickens.

38
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,350
Since we entered the village,

39
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,660
we've seen many chickens along the way,

40
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,070
but there are no droppings at all
on the ground.

41
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,950
Could it be
that the villagers care about hygiene,

42
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,230
so they've swept the floor?

43
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,180
No way.

44
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,070
I grew up in a village too.

45
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,540
I know if you have chickens,

46
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,350
there's no way

47
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,660
to keep the ground clean of droppings.

48
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,590
Besides,

49
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,070
would you clean the droppings

50
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,740
and leave the rubbish behind?

51
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,950
Chicken droppings. Chicken?

52
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,540
It's very weird.

53
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,950
Let's have a look at other places.

54
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,030
There's no one here.

55
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,470
Hu Lie Na.

56
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,780
Let's take a look.

57
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,660
Hu Lie Na, what are you doing?

58
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,380
I just found something

59
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,340
in this house,

60
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,820
but it disappeared instantly.

61
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,190
What did you find?

62
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,150
I don't know.

63
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,430
The walls and the floor

64
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,220
are fine,

65
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,820
and there shouldn't be any place to hide.

66
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,470
Then, did you see Ma Hong Jun?

67
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,500
I did.

68
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,540
He was in this house just now,

69
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,340
but he ran away when he saw me.

70
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,030
Why didn't you stop him?

71
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,340
I'm just sitting in on the class.

72
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,060
What happened in this village

73
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,220
is a test for you,

74
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,630
not for me.

75
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,710
Which way did he go then?

76
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,380
I don't know.

77
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,190
Wait.

78
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,030
What?

79
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,660
Why do you have to fight against me?

80
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:54,780
You

81
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,940
really don't remember who I am?

82
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,190
You mean we've met before?

83
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,430
Spit it out.

84
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,220
Ma Hong Jun?

85
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:13,990
Why are you running?

86
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:17,660
What are you doing?

87
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:18,710
What are you doing?

88
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,380
Had it not been for you,

89
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,150
I would have caught him!

90
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,990
I've told you that I'm in charge.

91
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,820
I didn't agree with it.

92
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,470
Isn't that the village head's house?

93
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:36,750
Where's that child?

94
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:43,630
Village Head.

95
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:45,430
You're back.

96
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,060
Did you see Ma Hong Jun?

97
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,100
Didn't you go and look for him?

98
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,540
We saw him,

99
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,630
but he ran away as soon as we spoke.

100
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,630
We went after him to this area,

101
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,470
and he was gone.

102
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,780
That boy grew up here.

103
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,660
If he hides,

104
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,780
it won't be easy to find him.

105
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:00,470
No.

106
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,710
But why did he run?

107
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,820
Maybe he's timid.

108
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,710
What happened?

109
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:05,910
Ou Si Ke.

110
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,030
Did anyone go in just now?

111
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,660
No. It's just me.

112
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:11,870
Don't stand in my way next time.

113
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,030
Why? Want to fight again?

114
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,380
You're no match for me.

115
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,220
You guys are really fighting?

116
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,500
Let's go back to the village head's house.

117
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:24,780
All right.

118
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,780
You're not coming with us?

119
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,220
I won't join you two.

120
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,190
I'm very interested

121
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,150
in what I've just found.

122
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,910
Be careful.

123
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:38,990
That might be

124
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,100
the monster who started the fire.

125
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,460
If I see it,

126
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,270
I'll let you know.

127
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,660
Do you hear any sounds?

128
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,020
It sounds like a fight.

129
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,510
Come on.

130
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,580
Still want to fight?

131
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,990
I admit

132
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,430
I'm no match for you now.

133
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,870
But someday,

134
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,430
I'll defeat you.

135
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,070
Let them in.

136
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,220
It's fine.

137
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,660
I can take care of it on my own.

138
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,310
Village Head,

139
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,430
we're so close to finding

140
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,510
Ma Hong Jun in the afternoon.

141
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,990
But he ran away when he saw us.

142
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,580
Why is he hiding from us?

143
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,630
Perhaps it's because

144
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,340
what had happened in his house

145
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,190
terrified him.

146
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,340
I've asked the villagers,

147
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,020
but no one knows

148
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,220
where he has been.

149
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,990
No one has given him any food these days, either.

150
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,140
Is that so?

151
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,220
It's my bad for not noticing it.

152
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,020
How about this?

153
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,660
Let me see

154
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,510
if I can find a villager's house

155
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,870
for him to stay.

156
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,430
He's so pitiful.

157
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,390
Right.

158
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,630
That's what I have been saying.

159
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,460
Actually,

160
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,390
this is also the main reason

161
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,390
that I wanted you to leave.

162
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,020
He was traumatized by the sudden event.

163
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,020
He is also

164
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,430
afraid of strangers.

165
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,270
Actually, it's very normal

166
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,020
that he doesn't want
to meet with people.

167
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,630
After you leave,

168
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,460
maybe he'll come out.

169
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,540
Village Head,

170
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,900
are you blaming us now?

171
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,020
I think that's how we should be.

172
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,870
What's the most important thing?

173
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,340
It must be kindness,

174
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,270
isn't it?

175
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:45,700
Yes.

176
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:46,830
Yes.

177
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,100
Kindness is the most important.

178
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,660
I'm not blaming you.

179
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,070
But we searched

180
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,140
for a whole afternoon,

181
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,700
and there was no monster to be seen.

182
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:56,990
What does this mean?

183
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,220
This means that there's no monster.

184
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,190
And the black object,

185
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,990
it could be that I misled you

186
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,830
because of my poor eyesight.

187
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:09,950
All right then.

188
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,540
If we can't get anything

189
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,660
out of tomorrow's investigation,

190
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,430
we'll leave.

191
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,580
Children,

192
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,270
it's better

193
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,270
to put more effort into your training.

194
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,630
You don't have

195
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,460
to waste your time

196
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,700
with these trivial matters

197
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,750
in the village.

198
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,070
I feel bad

199
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,870
for taking up your time.

200
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,070
Let's do this.

201
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,510
Tonight,

202
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,830
please spend the night at my place.

203
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,340
Village Head,

204
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,660
is there any Soul Master
in this village?

205
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,190
No.

206
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:52,780
Understand.

207
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,750
Village Head, you should rest early too.

208
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,270
Sure.

209
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,830
It's very late now. Can you see clearly?

210
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:06,700
Did you forget

211
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,830
that my Martial Soul is Four-eyed Eagle Owl?

212
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,990
My eyesight becomes better at night.

213
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,700
Come and rest for a while.

214
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,020
You've stood there for a day.

215
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,510
You seem to care a lot for them.

216
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,870
They are my students.

217
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,750
Then why don't you follow them in?

218
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,070
Let me tell you.

219
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,510
There's something weird

220
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,220
in this village.

221
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,630
It's a Soul Master or Soul Beast?

222
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,460
It's hard to tell.

223
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,340
Even you have no idea?

224
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:45,870
The troublesome part is

225
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,340
the black monster

226
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,750
is very sensitive about

227
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,630
the capability of Soul Masters.

228
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,780
It hid away as I approached

229
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,830
the village.

230
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,630
So you let the children enter the village

231
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,220
because they're weaker

232
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,780
and have a higher chance
of getting near the monster?

233
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,510
It'd be best

234
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,950
to let them lure the monster out

235
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,190
and then I'll rush in

236
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,310
to finish it at once.

237
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,870
Did the monster set the fire?

238
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:08,990
I don't know.

239
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,460
At first, I thought it was
a normal fire

240
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,220
so I came earlier to investigate.

241
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,190
Then I found out

242
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,390
that there's a monster

243
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,430
hiding in the village.

244
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,870
You have seven Soul Rings already,
but you can't find it

245
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,340
when it hides?

246
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,140
That's the weird part.

247
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,140
After it disappears,

248
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,750
you won't find any traces of it.

249
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,510
I only have two Soul Rings,

250
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,270
I should go and see.

251
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,510
You don't have to.

252
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,900
I've thought it over.

253
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,780
I wanted to give the children on this team

254
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,830
a chance to face

255
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,270
and solve a problem independently,

256
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,510
so as to train them.

257
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,220
You've started to train a team so soon?

258
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,430
It depends on their fate.

259
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:48,900
Besides,

260
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:49,750
those children,

261
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,190
each has one's own personality.

262
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,190
It's not easy

263
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,580
to make a team of them.

264
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,020
Brother Dai,

265
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,900
I'd like to tell you something.

266
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,870
Where did you go today?

267
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,310
Did you find out anything?

268
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,540
I was in the village,

269
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,900
and I didn't find out anything.

270
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,140
But there's something

271
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,660
that bothers me.

272
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,580
There are many chickens in this village

273
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,580
but there are no chicken droppings
on the ground.

274
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,020
What does this have to do with chickens?

275
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,460
It's not reasonable.

276
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,220
What chicken droppings?

277
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,390
What matters now is to find Ma Hong Jun,

278
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,140
and find out what's the monster
behind the fire.

279
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,310
Nothing else matters.

280
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,070
I think

281
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,020
someone is taking care of Ma Hong Jun.

282
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,190
Search from house to house tomorrow.

283
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,020
Brother Dai, listen to me.

284
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,580
I met Hu Lie Na in the afternoon.

285
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,830
She said she saw something weird.

286
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:53,630
What was that?

287
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,070
She said she didn't see it clearly.

288
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,140
I'm thinking

289
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,310
that if the monster

290
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,190
did set the fire,

291
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,430
why does it still stay in the village?

292
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,140
Why did it come?

293
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,660
About something so important,
you only tell me now?

294
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,100
I...

295
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,870
Just this much medicine left.

296
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,580
The effect can only last for one night.

297
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,270
Never mind.

298
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,870
I'll use everything that's left.

299
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,460
Didn't we agree

300
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,900
that you'd stay indoors for two days?

301
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,340
Why didn't you listen to me?

302
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,580
I just wanted to have a look back home.

303
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,870
Don't go out during these two days.

304
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,780
You can come out

305
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,660
after they leave.

306
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,580
I still want to see my dad.

307
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:10,510
Here.

308
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,780
Drink it while it's hot.
It'll warm you up.

309
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,270
Your dad.

310
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,580
Your dad is not a human anymore.

311
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,750
Not a human.

312
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,510
Not a human.

313
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,190
Hong Jun,

314
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,140
listen.

315
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,430
Don't go out.

316
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,140
I'll figure it out

317
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,190
after the Soul Masters leave.

318
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,670
There is a question that I couldn't understand.

319
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,300
Why don't you leave even when the house

320
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,630
has burnt down?

321
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,790
It's because you still have something to do.

322
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,030
Run?

323
00:17:37,064 --> 00:17:47,064

324
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,030
What is it?

325
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:06,580
Not feeling good?

326
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,750
I just feel

327
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,030
that the more people we've met,

328
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,670
the more rules there are.

329
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,420
Of course.

330
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:18,940
If everyone

331
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,060
could do as they please,

332
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:21,990
the world would be in a mess.

333
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,150
Isn't it good to do whatever we want?

334
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,870
I think

335
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,870
not all rules

336
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,670
are bad actually.

337
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,150
For example?

338
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,510
For example?

339
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,700
For example, I wanted to be a Soul Master

340
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,990
and I enrolled in the school.

341
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,910
And then,

342
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,390
I met you.

343
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,870
If so,

344
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,790
going to school will be the best rule.

345
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:57,750
That's right.

346
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,990
Then I want to keep going to school.
Keep going to school.

347
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:01,870
Keep going to school.

348
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:02,990
In that case,

349
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,460
I can always be with Brother San.

350
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,510
What you said

351
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,270
is right.

352
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,910
Did you hear any sounds?

353
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,670
Let's have a look.

354
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,060
Come.

355
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,460
What do you want from me?

356
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:27,750
Why?

357
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,100
The fight in the afternoon
was not enough?

358
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:29,750
It's them again.

359
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:30,750
Want to try again?

360
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,670
You asked me in the afternoon

361
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,300
why I must fight with you.

362
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,750
You want to tell me now?

363
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,580
Give me some time

364
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,670
to challenge you again.

365
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:43,940
If I fail again,

366
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,550
I'll accept my fate.

367
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,790
What good is it if you defeat me?

368
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:49,940
My name is Zhu Zhu Qing.

369
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,180
You really forgot

370
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:57,820
the name of your fiancée.

371
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,510
Fiancée.

372
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:03,820
Why should I marry a man

373
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,910
who I've only met once?

374
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,180
Why no one asked me

375
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:07,910
if I was willing to get married?

376
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,100
Why can't I

377
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,820
have the right to choose my fate?

378
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:14,870
I came to break off the engagement.

379
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,580
Break off?

380
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:16,820
Okay.

381
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,870
You can tell me directly.

382
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,340
Why must you challenge me?

383
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,460
Because you said

384
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,510
you'd only

385
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,180
change your mind if I defeat you.

386
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:26,990
Fine!

387
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,030
I'll become strong

388
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,030
and let you lose completely.

389
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,060
So, I'll have the right

390
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,150
to make you give up this marriage!

391
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,910
Didn't my family tell you?

392
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:36,990
Tell me what?

393
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,270
One of the reasons why I left the tribe

394
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,340
is that I refuse a political marriage.

395
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,030
I agree to call off the engagement.

396
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,270
We're on the same page in this matter.

397
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,940
This is very ridiculous.

398
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,630
Growing up, we only met once.

399
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:49,870
How could it

400
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,870
turn into a marriage?

401
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,150
It's all because of you!

402
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,100
Me?

403
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,630
This was decided by the tribe.

404
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,700
What does it have to do with me?

405
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,550
If you hadn't insisted on kissing me
at that time,

406
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,220
why would they have...

407
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,550
I kissed you?

408
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,420
I don't remember it at all.

409
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,420
You're abandoning me!

410
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,220
No, this is not the right word.

411
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,940
Anyway, you're a jerk!

412
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:23,940
Did I kiss her?

413
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,420
On the surface, you can't tell

414
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,420
that Brother Dai is this kind of person.

415
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,550
No wonder she has been picking on Brother Dai.

416
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,150
What's wrong with Dai Mu Bai?

417
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,100
You scared me!

418
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,910
We just found out

419
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,870
that the amazing sister's name

420
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,030
is Zhu Zhu Qing.

421
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:50,060
She is Brother Dai's fiancée.

422
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,060
She came to Shi Lan Ke

423
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:53,910
to break off the engagement.

424
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,460
Where is he now?

425
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,150
Over there.

426
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,580
I didn't know that her curiosity
is stronger than mine.

427
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,460
Zhu Zhu Qing is your fiancée?

428
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,750
What does that have to do with you?

429
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,300
I can help you catch the monster
who set the fire.

430
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,510
In exchange,

431
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,750
you have to tell me the matter
between you and her.

432
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:24,910
Okay?

433
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:27,100
Why?

434
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,060
Curiosity.

435
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,030
It's late now.

436
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,060
If there's nothing else,

437
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,060
I want to rest now.

438
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:33,270
Sorry.

439
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,910
I was impatient.

440
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,270
I just wanted to know you better.

441
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,750
We're just from the same school.

442
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,390
You don't have to know me better.

443
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,100
You know where the monster is?

444
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:51,750
I know.

445
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,340
Bring me there.

446
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,910
You're not bringing the others?

447
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,550
I alone suffice.

448
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,060
Let's follow them.

449
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,420
If Brother Dai is in danger,

450
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,340
we can help him.

451
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:05,630
He always picks on you,

452
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:06,820
you still want to help him?

453
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,550
It's just a misunderstanding.

454
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,870
We can't let him risk his life, can we?

455
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:11,820
Let's go.

456
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:12,940
Okay.

457
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:28,510
Wu,

458
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:29,870
later when you go in,

459
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:30,940
try not to make any noise.

460
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,340
What are you looking for?

461
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,630
There's no chicken?

462
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,390
Of course, the chickens are sleeping.

463
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,790
It's fine. Let's go.

464
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,220
You said you followed the monster here?

465
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,420
Look, this house is abnormal.

466
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,670
I chased after the monster and got here.

467
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,580
It escaped from this door.

468
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,700
It escaped from this door?

469
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,220
Then why did you bring me in?

470
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,420
Because this door

471
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,390
can only be opened from inside.

472
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,870
My goodness. What is going on?

473
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,460
It seems like...

474
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,100
the chicken is monitoring us.

475
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,420
Something is weird.

476
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:24,220
Wait for me here.

477
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,870
How did you find this place?

478
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,150
I was looking for the monster,

479
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:31,630
and I found

480
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,940
it had been watching the village head's house.

481
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,750
I want to talk to it,

482
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:35,910
but it ran away.

483
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,420
Then I chased after it to this place.

484
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,060
This is probably caused
by Space Branch Martial Soul.

485
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:45,580
You're saying

486
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,670
this is an independent space

487
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:48,550
built by a Martial Soul?

488
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:49,870
That's right.

489
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,390
But this kind of independent space
won't be too big.

490
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,180
At most, it'll be the size of
the Nightfire Village.

491
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,180
So,

492
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,150
the monster is a Space Branch Soul Beast?

493
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,630
It's hard to determine now.

494
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,180
But why does it want to set the space

495
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,420
in the Nightfire Village?

496
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,580
Now we have to find it

497
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:07,820
to know the answer.

498
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,460
Last time,

499
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,270
I lost it here.

500
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,100
So, I'm not sure

501
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,030
where it is now.

502
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,060
Let's search again.

503
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,300
We'll get the answer for sure.

504
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:21,870
Don't have to search anymore.

505
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,100
It appeared of its own accord.

506
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,060
It's so weird here.

507
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,100
It looks exactly like
the Nightfire Village.

508
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,150
But there are no villagers.

509
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,870
That's not my point.

510
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:44,790
What is it?

511
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,100
This place is giving off

512
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,150
a very sad vibe.

513
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,460
Sad?

514
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:55,510
What is it?

515
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:00,670
Brother Dai.

516
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:07,790
Brother Dai.

517
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,460
What happened?

518
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,100
How did you come here?

519
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,550
You fought with the monster?

520
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,340
I just lured the monster away.

521
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,580
You're injured.

522
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,220
Yes.

523
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,100
There were flames on the monster.

524
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,220
What's going on here?

525
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,700
Among the Space Branch Soul Masters
or Soul Beasts,

526
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:57,910
there are a few exceptions

527
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,940
that can create an independent space.

528
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,820
It is a Soul Master or a Soul Beast?

529
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,220
I don't know.

530
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,700
All I know is

531
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,870
it is very strong.

532
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,630
Dai Mu Bai was hit by it in the front.

533
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,420
Let's help Brother Dai
to get back first.

534
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,030
Brother Dai.

535
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,460
Brother Dai.

536
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:36,550
Brother Dai.

537
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:39,100
Here.

538
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,510
Why am I here?

539
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,340
Do you remember

540
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,300
what happened last night?

541
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:57,630
Last night.

542
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,220
Last night I got through the door
with Hu Lie Na.

543
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,270
And then...

544
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,390
The monster came out...

545
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,700
And I passed out.

546
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,100
How strong was that monster?

547
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:56,870
It can't be compared to Headmaster.

548
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,270
Did it have flames on its body?

549
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:00,700
Flame?

550
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:02,870
No.

551
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,340
How did I come back?

552
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,910
Tang San carried you.

553
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,790
Then I put you on the bed

554
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,510
and covered you up with the blanket,

555
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,030
Brother Dai.

556
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:14,870
Where are Hu Lie Na and Wu?

557
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,910
They went to inform the village head
that the monster had been found,

558
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,180
and managed to trick
the village head out.

559
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,060
Why did they have to trick him?

560
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,750
Hu Lie Na said the monster

561
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,340
had been roaming around
the village head's house.

562
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:29,060
You're saying that the monster
wanted to harm the village head?

563
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,700
Yesterday we found Ma Hong Jun

564
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,750
hiding

565
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,750
in that burnt house,

566
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:33,940
and the monster

567
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,460
showed up nearby.

568
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,940
This monster keeps lurking
in the Nightfire Village?

569
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,670
It must think that the fire last time

570
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:42,550
didn't kill Ma Hong Jun,

571
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,910
so it's waiting for another chance.

572
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,420
It's possible.

573
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,990
How is the village head
connected to it?

574
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,940
I also thought about it yesterday.

575
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,180
That house has burnt down for many days.

576
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,100
There should be someone

577
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,460
taking care of Ma Hong Jun.

578
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:54,790
So I went

579
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,150
to the village head's kitchen
early in the morning,

580
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,910
and I found yesterday's dirty dishes.

581
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,300
In terms of the quantity,

582
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,550
there's an extra set.

583
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,180
This means

584
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,820
Ma Hong Jun has been staying
in the village head's house.

585
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,390
You tricked him out on purpose?

586
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:09,340
Tang San,

587
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,030
with so many suspicious points,

588
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,510
you should have told us earlier.

589
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,510
This village is too weird.

590
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,420
I dared not say it.

591
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,180
Can you two

592
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,510
not argue at this time?

593
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,100
Hurry and find it.

594
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,220
Brother Dai, your wounds.

595
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,420
Ou Si Ke,

596
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:26,940
your Martial Soul.

597
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:30,820
Martial Soul?

598
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,630
I...

599
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,060
I'll pour you some water, Brother Dai.

600
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,100
Hurry up.

601
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,100
Here.

602
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,060
Here you go, Brother Dai.

603
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,030
Here, here, here.

604
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:45,420
Your Martial Soul can heal wounds.

605
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,220
Brother Dai,

606
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,820
you promised not to tell.

607
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,820
But I have to capture
the monster quickly.

608
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,670
If not, Ma Hong Jun and the village head
will be in danger.

609
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:03,340
Tang San,

610
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:04,910
go out for a while.

611
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,100
You can't peek.

612
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,220
I'm not peeking.

613
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:10,910
That...

614
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,940
You go and stand in the middle
of the courtyard.

615
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:15,390
Fine, fine, fine.

616
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,750
What are you all doing?

617
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,460
Brother Dai is injured.

618
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,100
Ou Si Ke is using his Martial Soul

619
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:26,790
to heal his wounds.

620
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,460
Dai Mu Bai is injured?

621
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,940
Recover fully!

622
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,670
He said what fully?

623
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,700
I heard it wrong.

624
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,270
Didn't you say he was injured?

625
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,460
You're done?

626
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,100
What is your Martial Soul?

627
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:48,870
It's so amazing.

628
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,820
I won't tell.

629
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:51,550
You can't tell either.

630
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,910
Let's find Ma Hong Jun first.

631
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,180
Are you Ma Hong Jun?

632
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,180
We're the Soul Masters
from Shi Lan Ke School.

633
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:22,750
Don't worry.

634
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:23,830
We've found

635
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:24,900
the black monster.

636
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,380
His mental condition

637
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,900
is different from what I saw yesterday.

638
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,620
He's more distrait today.

639
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,270
Brother,

640
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,590
if you don't sleep for a night,

641
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,380
you would be like this too.

642
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,140
This child is so pitiful.

643
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,110
He lives in such a shabby shack

644
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,030
with the wind blowing everywhere.

645
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,550
He must not have a good sleep
last night.

646
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:44,990
Look at his dark circles.

647
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,550
I'll bring him some water
for him to wash his face.

648
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,110
It should be able to wake him up.

649
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,350
Brother Dai,

650
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,140
last night Hu Lie Na said

651
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,180
the monster could have killed you,

652
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,750
but it didn't.

653
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,510
Right.

654
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,620
Why didn't it kill me?

655
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,310
I get it now.

656
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,660
I'm such a genius.

657
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:10,860
Tang San said before

658
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,660
that there were no chicken droppings
in this village.

659
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,350
Now this monster doesn't kill anyone.

660
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,550
Why?

661
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:17,900
This means that the monster

662
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,460
lives by eating chicken droppings!

663
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,590
I'm so smart!

664
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,790
It used to be a scary monster,

665
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,940
but you just made it disgusting.

666
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,550
Isn't this right?

667
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,140
Stop, stop, stop.

668
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,790
Let's analyse the identity

669
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,110
of this monster first.

670
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,700
Is it a Soul Master or a Soul Beast?

671
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,030
I fought with it yesterday,

672
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,830
and I'm sure

673
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,790
that it was a human form.

674
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,070
So we can rule out

675
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,310
the possibility of its being a Soul Beast.

676
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,380
Then his identity should be
a Soul Master.
