<i>Episode 11</i>

15
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,400
Let's analyze the identity

16
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,760
of this monster first.

17
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,310
Is it a Soul Master or a Soul Beast?

18
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,800
I fought with it yesterday,

19
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,440
and I'm sure

20
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,400
that it was a human form.

21
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
So we can rule out

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,910
the possibility of its being a Soul Beast.

23
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,000
Then his identity should be
a Soul Master.

24
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,680
A Soul Master who is
against Ma Hong Jun's family.

25
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,800
Why does he remain in the Nightfire Village?

26
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,510
Not only prolonging his stay
in the Nightfire Village,

27
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,720
but he also kept trying to approach Ma Hong Jun.

28
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,720
The village head said that the fire

29
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,080
had burnt Ma Hong Jun's father to death.

30
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,910
They buried him.

31
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,120
Yesterday,

32
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,590
when I went to the cemetery,

33
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,320
there wasn't any new grave.

34
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,360
There was no sign of the surrounding
being dug up.

35
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,110
It means the village head lied to us.

36
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,800
I can't help but think of a possibility.

37
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,320
What's that?

38
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,520
This fire

39
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,550
was just an accident.

40
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,030
But it happened to be discovered
by an outsider

41
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,670
and reported to our school.

42
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,750
The village head doesn't want
more attention on this incident.

43
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,830
Because there's no monster
in the first place.

44
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,160
He's not a monster!

45
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,880
He is my father.

46
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,670
What?

47
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,830
How can a human become a monster?

48
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:53,630
I'm Tang San.

49
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,240
He's Dai Mu Bai.

50
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,270
Ou Si Ke.

51
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,520
And she's Zhu Zhu Qing.

52
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,520
We are from Shi Lan Ke School,

53
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,880
and we are here to help you.

54
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,000
If you agree,

55
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,320
we can even help your dad.

56
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,910
Can you save him?

57
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,630
We will do our best.

58
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,080
But you must tell us the truth.

59
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,960
I was asleep

60
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,360
that night.

61
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,190
When I was startled,

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,550
my dad had turned into that.

63
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,000
He couldn't even recognize me.

64
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,240
Then, the village head rushed over

65
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,830
and saved me out of the fire.

66
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,360
I cried out for my dad.

67
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,160
But he didn't seem to get it.

68
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,600
Instead, he escaped.

69
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,160
Your dad was a Soul Master?

70
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,320
I don't know.

71
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,240
But how did he turn out like that?

72
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,270
I really don't know.

73
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,720
So why were you hiding here?

74
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,240
The village head allowed me
to take shelter here.

75
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:54,830
He said...

76
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,670
He couldn't let you know the truth.

77
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,600
Otherwise...

78
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,320
You will kill my dad.

79
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,720
The village head knows
where your dad is hiding?

80
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,800
He doesn't know.

81
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,440
He is searching for my dad too.

82
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,190
We already know

83
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,160
where your dad is hiding.

84
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,720
We'll go there immediately

85
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,440
and find out how we can help him.

86
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,630
Don't worry.

87
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:17,830
I promise

88
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,080
we will never hurt him.

89
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,110
I'm going with you.

90
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,670
Bring Ma Hong Jun along.

91
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,320
That might lure his father out.

92
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,950
Won't it be dangerous?

93
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,070
I'm not afraid.

94
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,720
Maybe he is about to regain consciousness.

95
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,790
Maybe

96
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,320
he will be fine when I wake him up.

97
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,320
Let's bring him with us.

98
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,950
I'm quick on my feet.

99
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,350
If there's any threat,

100
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,350
I'll bring him with me.

101
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:44,760
Let's go.

102
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,160
The chicken droppings, Tang San.

103
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,040
Chicken droppings.

104
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,160
It's more suspicious

105
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,480
to appear now.

106
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,720
Let's go.

107
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,880
It's nothing. I'll get going.

108
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,720
Be careful.

109
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,070
Where's Wu?

110
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,350
She hasn't been around since morning.

111
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,880
She went with Hu Lie Na
to lead the village head away.

112
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,880
We should be enough.

113
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,950
If the opponent is too strong,

114
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,070
you are responsible for bringing
Ma Hong Jun away.

115
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,670
Then ask Headmaster to come over.

116
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,880
Sure.

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,670
I thought

118
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,440
you wouldn't agree

119
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,320
with Brother Dai's arrangement.

120
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,790
I only hate him.

121
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,640
It doesn't mean I don't know
what's important.

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,670
Village Head.

123
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,640
Only you here?

124
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,230
The two female students
who were with you

125
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,440
came this morning

126
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,480
and wanted to show me

127
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,880
the monster that burnt the hut.

128
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,640
But halfway down the road,

129
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,600
they both disappeared.

130
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,670
Where do you think

131
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,830
they went?

132
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,600
And the rest?

133
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,390
They...

134
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,790
They said they found

135
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,640
some leads on the fire incident.

136
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,760
They even found

137
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,920
a particularly strange entrance.

138
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,200
So...

139
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,550
They found out the truth?

140
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,550
Yes.

141
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,670
Village Head.

142
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,040
About saving Ma Hong Jun's dad,

143
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,880
stop trying to hide it from us.

144
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,230
You've got to trust Shi Lan Ke School.

145
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,830
We're very strong, you know?

146
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,950
I know, I know.

147
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,480
We could definitely solve your problems.

148
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,440
You've got to trust us.

149
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,040
Yes, yes.

150
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,110
Here, have some water.

151
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,670
In that case,

152
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,440
the strange-looking entrance,

153
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,600
where could it be?

154
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,040
The entrance...

155
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,000
I think...

156
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,830
There's an empty hut

157
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,200
in the middle of the village.

158
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,550
So there's the entrance.

159
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,950
I didn't expect

160
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,480
he would place the entrance there.

161
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,760
You, you...

162
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,640
You have always known that?

163
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,920
I... This...

164
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,440
I'll attack in the front later.

165
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
You'll approach from the sides.

166
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,470
You've already lost once.

167
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,000
Now there are three of us.

168
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,400
It's different from the last time.

169
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,880
We still have to understand

170
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,030
each of our Martial Soul,

171
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,350
and come up with a tactic.

172
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,150
I'll attack him up front while you guys
keep him in check.

173
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,350
This is our tactic.

174
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,960
Tang San, what do you think?

175
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,110
Just do as Brother Dai said.

176
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,960
What if we lose again?

177
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,760
Haven't I told you?

178
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,280
If we can't defeat him,

179
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,670
you go to bring Headmaster over.

180
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,350
Why don't we ask for his help
in the first place?

181
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,470
This is our test.

182
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,320
Stop trying to rely on others.

183
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,150
We have to try with our strength first.

184
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,320
I keep seeing these specks.

185
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,110
There should be a source.

186
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,670
That's the source.

187
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,200
Dad.

188
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,320
Dad!

189
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,840
Dad, do you recognize me?

190
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,150
<i>White Tiger Intense Light Wave!</i>

191
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,080
<i>Nether Claws!</i>

192
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,400
You promised not to harm him.

193
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,080
Don't worry.

194
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,000
There's a chance.

195
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,520
<i>Nether Spikes!</i>

196
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,150
<i>White Tiger Vajra Transformation!</i>

197
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,640
Tang San, what are you doing?

198
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,670
Let's get some rest here.

199
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,640
What happened to him?

200
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,320
You can't trust these Soul Masters.

201
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,280
But...

202
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,710
They promised to help us.

203
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,110
They were lying to you.

204
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,320
Let me tell you.

205
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,470
Their real intention

206
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,400
is to capture your father!

207
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,960
When they capture your father,

208
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,150
they will study the cause of his mutation.

209
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,230
And...

210
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,440
And you will

211
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,670
never see your father again.

212
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:33,790
Are you sure?

213
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,350
Yes.

214
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,400
But they...

215
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,470
Hong Jun, do you trust me?

216
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,960
Then, follow me.

217
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:47,710
Let's go.

218
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,400
Follow me.

219
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,550
Go and help Tang San out.

220
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,640
I'll follow them.

221
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,710
This... This is my home.

222
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,670
Hasn't it burnt down?

223
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,550
Where is this place?

224
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,590
Why do we capture him?

225
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,080
These Soul Masters would do anything.

226
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,520
We take one of them hostage

227
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,280
to protect us.

228
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,400
Are you misunderstanding something?

229
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,230
Stand still.

230
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,670
The fire is protecting this house.

231
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,280
Hong Jun,

232
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,470
go forward.

233
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,840
This fire won't harm you.

234
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,280
Hong Jun,

235
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,470
trust me.

236
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,000
I won't lie to you.

237
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,280
If you go through the flame barrier,

238
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,440
you'll be able to help your father.

239
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,880
Is that so?

240
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,790
Yes.

241
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,710
Ma Hong Jun.

242
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,080
Ma Hong Jun, don't go.

243
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,520
It'll burn you to death, Ma Hong Jun.

244
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,280
Ma Hong Jun, don't go.

245
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,000
Don't go. Come back.

246
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,350
Don't go.

247
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,080
Please don't go, Ma Hong Jun.

248
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,550
Trust me, you can't go.

249
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,670
Come back.

250
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,080
I went through it.

251
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,080
The fire didn't burn me.

252
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,590
It's finally done.

253
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,230
Move.

254
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,470
I'm not going.

255
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,350
-Go!
-No, I'm not going.

256
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:38,840
I...

257
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,440
Go...

258
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,840
It's you?

259
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,150
Why didn't you go and help Tang San?

260
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,280
He doesn't need my help.

261
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,710
Keep an eye on them.

262
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,550
I'm going in to take a look.

263
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,880
What are you doing?

264
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,440
You want to go in, don't you?

265
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,110
As long as we don't attack first,

266
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,400
he won't harm us.

267
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,790
He even knocked me out yesterday.

268
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,520
But why didn't he take your life?

269
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,440
After dragging you here,

270
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,230
did he attack you first?

271
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,110
We took a move first.

272
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,110
How did you know?

273
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,080
When we heard the fighting,

274
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,470
I rushed over here with Wu.

275
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,960
He was the first one we met.

276
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,030
Then where did he bring you?

277
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,350
Outside the village, Ma Hong Jun's house.

278
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,110
Why did you

279
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,710
keep this information from us?

280
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,440
I couldn't talk about it in the village.

281
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,640
Because we were being watched.

282
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,640
Who?

283
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,760
Those chickens.

284
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,590
How come there are plenty of chickens,

285
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,520
but no chicken droppings?

286
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,840
It means that they are not real chickens,

287
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:03,960
but Martial Soul.

288
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,280
What?

289
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,760
Our teacher has mentioned

290
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,280
that the Martial Soul takes its animal form

291
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,710
by combining a Tool Soul
with a Beast Soul

292
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,880
into a Mutant Soul.

293
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,710
Combining a Tool Soul with a Beast Soul?

294
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,320
Didn't you see the chicken droppings?

295
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,150
That's because

296
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,640
I told you about my concern.

297
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,230
Do you still remember?

298
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,880
This village has chickens everywhere.

299
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,790
But there are
no chicken droppings on the ground.

300
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,640
You mean...

301
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,790
You said that in front of the chickens
on purpose?

302
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,550
Yes.

303
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,960
This loophole happened

304
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,960
to be fixed in the end.

305
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,790
The chicken droppings that we saw today

306
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,280
prove that these chickens

307
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,910
are there to spy on us.

308
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,710
If what you said is right,

309
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,670
it means there are many Martial Souls around.

310
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,840
How many Soul Masters will be needed
to control them all?

311
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,000
Unless

312
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,470
everyone in this village

313
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,840
is a Soul Master.

314
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,440
You lied to us first.

315
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,280
How did you get here?

316
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,640
Did you fight with the monster?

317
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,400
I just lured the monster away.

318
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,880
You're injured?

319
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,520
Yes.

320
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,230
There were flames on the monster.

321
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,960
You said you had lured the monster away.

322
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,670
But you weren't there

323
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,880
when we saw him.

324
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,230
What's more,

325
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,760
Brother Dai fought with him once.

326
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,200
But he didn't mention anything
about the flame.

327
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:26,760
Therefore,

328
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,110
your wound

329
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,350
was not caused by the monster.

330
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,550
But by this flame barrier.

331
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,640
You want to enter this house.

332
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,550
So, can I enter now?

333
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,880
No way.

334
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,150
You're not fighting me?

335
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,840
I'm only interested

336
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,520
in the Martial Soul in the house.

337
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,400
There's no need to fight you.

338
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,470
So there's a Martial Soul in the house?

339
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,080
I'll just have a look.

340

341
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,800
Let me see it.

342
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,000
I promise I won't do anything.

343
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,590
Only a glimpse.

344
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,950
That chicken is a Martial Soul?

345
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,800
A Martial Soul
that can control flames at will.

346
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,950
There are only a few of them.

347
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,830
Judging by its appearance,

348
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,560
there is only one possibility.

349
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,070
It's a turkey!

350
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,590
It's a phoenix.

351
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,190
Phoenix Soul?

352
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,040
That's very rare.

353
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:52,920
But...

354
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,800
Why would it say here?

355
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,680
The flame barrier doesn't harm him.

356
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,230
It's because that's his Martial Soul.

357
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,110
His Martial Soul?

358
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,310
But the villagers have mentioned

359
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,830
that there's no Soul Master
in the Nightfire Village.

360
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,040
Besides, why is his Martial Soul

361
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,710
locked in this house?

362
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,760
I don't know.

363
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,040
They are here!

364
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,640
Village Head.

365
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,280
Come, Ou Si Ke.

366
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,310
Come and give me a hand.

367
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:26,830
Quick.

368
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,470
Where's Ma Hong Jun?

369
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,920
He's still there?

370
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:36,880
Yes.

371
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,760
In the house, there is...

372
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,110
How do I describe it?

373
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,800
It's like a...

374
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,110
It looks like a chicken.

375
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,680
Yes, that's great.

376
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,710
It's a success, it's a success!

377
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,640
Village Head.

378
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:57,760
The chicken in the house

379
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,470
is Ma Hong Jun's Martial Soul?

380
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,470
Yes.

381
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,560
"Dark fire was born from the void."

382
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,470
It's the phoenix in the legend!

383
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,880
It's the Evil Phoenix.

384
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,680
I know!

385
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,190
Three hundred years ago,
heroes arose.

386
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,640
The Soul Masters battled it out
in Doulo Continent.

387
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,830
That stunning battle.

388
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,470
Don't you guys watch comedies?

389
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,950
One of them is the Evil Phoenix.

390
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:23,920
And it's the villain.

391
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,310
It's super evil

392
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,350
and powerful.

393
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,640
He's right.

394
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,560
The Soul Master with the Evil Phoenix

395
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,040
participated in the battle.

396
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,880
He was actually our ancestor.

397
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,310
After our ancestor passed away,

398
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,070
his blood has been passed down to us.

399
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,710
So all the villagers are Soul Masters.

400
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,760
Their Martial Souls are those chickens.

401
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,830
You have keen eyes.

402
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,310
Village Head,

403
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,070
this is not what you told us previously.

404
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,640
The villagers don't even admit

405
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,560
they are Soul Masters.

406
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,470
They were not lying to you.

407
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,430
Even though we have Martial Souls,

408
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,160
we can't be real Soul Masters.

409
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,590
Why do you say so?

410
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,470
We can't advance without the Soul Ring.

411
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,640
Do you think we deserve
to be called Soul Masters?

412
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,280
But there's always an exception,
am I right?

413
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,710
That's true.

414
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,190
We're fortunate that our blood

415
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,640
finally stands a chance
for a possible mutation.

416
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,160
Ma Hong Jun's Evil Phoenix

417
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,760
is the result of a mutation of Martial Soul.

418
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,590
That's true.

419
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,710
After years of trials,

420
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,560
our Evil Phoenix

421
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,070
has finally appeared again!

422
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,560
Trials...

423
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,000
Ma Hong Jun's mutation of Martial Soul

424
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,070
is not natural?

425
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,040
I used a special medicine

426
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,310
to prompt a possible mutation.

427
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,520
But that's not right.

428
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,000
So what actually happened
to Ma Hong Jun's father?

429
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,560
My medicine

430
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,350
has taken effect on him!

431
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,520
Did he agree to that?

432
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,560
Of course.

433
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,230
This is for the rise of our tribe.

434
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,560
How can he not agree?

435
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,040
However,

436
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,640
by chance,

437
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,760
I was surprised to find

438
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,280
his son, Ma Hong Jun,

439
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,710
has better talent.

440
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,830
His Martial Soul

441
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,680
could be perfectly mutated.

442
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,560
Therefore,

443
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,430
Ma Hong Jun became
your experimental object.

444
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,950
This infuriated his father.

445
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,950
He burnt his own house?

446
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,400
He was short-sighted!

447
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,760
He should understand

448
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,160
that his son is the hope of our tribe!

449
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,830
How did he turn out like that?

450
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,950
That night,

451
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:32,830
I was about

452
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,400
to take Ma Hong Jun away
while he was asleep.

453
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,430
But this man wanted to fight back.

454
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,520
But he couldn't overcome the effect
of the medicine.

455
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,710
When I was about to leave the house,

456
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,830
the Martial Soul in his body
started to burn.

457
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,230
Eventually,

458
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,430
the flame turned him

459
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,230
into this monster now.

460
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,190
Remember!

461
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,800
Your son

462
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,070
is the hope of our tribe!

463
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,520
I won't let my son suffer

464
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,640
the same pain that I went through.

465
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,040
Hong Jun!

466
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,040
Village Head!

467
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,520
Come here.

468
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,400
Come here quickly.

469
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,400
Village Head.

470
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,430
Dad!

471
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,470
Dad...

472
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,110
Something went wrong with your father.

473
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,760
He has now turned into a monster.

474
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,950
Don't approach him.

475
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,310
But why didn't he kill you?

476
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,190
Even though his Martial Soul was burning,

477
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,070
he couldn't resist the effect
of the medicine.

478
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,160
So he couldn't hurt me.

479
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,710
I never thought

480
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,760
that when his Martial Soul was burning,

481
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,880
he gained the power of the space element.

482
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,710
He opened up a space like this.

483
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,350
Everyone.

484
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,310
Thank you

485
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,590
for bringing me here.

486
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,830
I will double your reward.

487
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,310
This has nothing to do with money.

488
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,880
I want to help him.

489
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,710
What's wrong?

490
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,680
This is weird.

491
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,040
Why I don't see them in the village?

492
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,310
Are they in their room?

493
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,710
They can't stay in the room forever.

494
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,470
It has been a while.

495
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,280
Something's wrong.

496
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:32,920
Wait here.

497
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,470
I'll go in and have a look.

498
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,190
Who do you want to help?

499
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,400
Him.

500
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,590
I want to tell Ma Hong Jun the truth.

501
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,920
The truth?

502
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,590
All the things we did

503
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,350
are for the reappearance of the Evil Phoenix!

504
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,680
With this power,

505
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,590
the Ma tribe will be able to rise again!

506
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,710
The process may be cruel.

507
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,230
But it's worth it.

508
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,680
It's not up to you

509
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,040
whether it's worth it or not.

510
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,350
So, do you think you can decide?

511
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,430
No one can decide it!

512
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,560
But this has gone too far!

513
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,560
I can't stand it!

514
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,190
Brother Dai!

515
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,000
I agree.

516
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,230
Let's put an end to it quickly.

517
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,470
Put an end to it quickly?

518
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,470
A bunch of arrogant brats.

519
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,560
Fine.

520
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,160
All of you will die here.

521
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,680
You think you can defeat us?

522
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,560
The early phase of
a Mutant Soul

523
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,430
will affect the person's mind.

524
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,920
In a while, he can only obey

525
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,400
orders from a familiar voice.

526
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,710
Along with my medicine...

527
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,520
Do you think

528
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,430
Hong Jun will listen to you?

529
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,880
Hong Jun, listen to me.

530
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,710
Reach out your hand.

531
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,400
Try to touch it.

532
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:04,950
Brother Dai.

533
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,920
He wants to control your son!

534
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,160
He is basically a corpse.

535
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,800
You think he can understand your words?

536
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,920
Consider yourself lucky.

537
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,830
To be able to witness
the legendary Martial Soul,

538
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,230
Evil Phoenix!

539
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,430
Why does he have
two Soul Rings around him?

540
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,430
You won't know

541
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,310
about the power of the Evil Phoenix.

542
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,830
Hong Jun, listen to me.

543
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,800
They want to harm us and the village.

544
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,190
They want to harm your father.

545
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:15,950
But they promised to help me.

546
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,280
That's a lie.

547
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,590
They are all lying to you.

548
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,590
They are all liars!

549
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,640
Ma Hong Jun.

550
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,160
The village head wants to hurt you and
your father.

551
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,190
Don't ever trust him.

552
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,470
Hong Jun, did you hear that?

553
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,560
They even threaten to harm me.

554
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,640
Liars.

555
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,230
Liars!

556
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,310
Watch out!

557
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,470
Stay out of it.

558
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,920
Let go of your hand.

559
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,880
For Ma Hong Jun,

560
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,350
the village head is the one
he trusts most.

561
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,160
If you hurt him,

562
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,560
it'll only infuriate Ma Hong Jun more.

563
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,190
That's right.

564
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:20,830
Let go of your hand!

565
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,280
Did you see that?

566
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,880
This is the Evil Phoenix!

567
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,430
The top Martial Soul!

568
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:45,190
There's a big gap

569
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,880
between talented and ordinary Soul Masters!

570
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,070
A Double Soul Rings.

571
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,350
He even wants to kill us.

572
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,070
What happened?

573
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,230
Your opponent is me.

574
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,280
So this is the Evil Phoenix?

575
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,070
What a disappointment.

576
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,350
What happened?

577
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:55,830
Let me tell you.

578
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,310
There's a big gap

579
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,560
between talented and ordinary Soul Masters.

580
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,400
All of us

581
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,950
are the best of the best!

582
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:01,880
Nonsense!

583
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,950
It's impossible
for a poor school

584
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,640
to have such students.

585
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,110
What is he trying to do?

586
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,400
He...

587
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,280
He wants to help him.

588
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,830
He wants to control his son's body.

589
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,760
He wants to control
the Evil Phoenix's power.

590
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,160
Look!

591
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,400
This space won't last any longer.

592
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,400
Are you all right?

593
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:30,640
I'm all right.

594
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,350
We... We came back.

595
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,430
Hong Jun!

596
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:08,830
Dad.

597
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,710
You're back.

598
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,520
Our house isn't burnt.

599
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,040
Everything was just a dream.

600
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,350
That's great.

601
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,560
Dad,

602
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:34,040
what happened to your face?

603
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,110
My child,

604
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,880
I burnt my Martial Soul and life

605
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,880
to create that deep space.

606
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,920
It's only in that space

607
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,430
that I can give you all I have.

608
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,560
It's only when you possess
my Martial Soul and power

609
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,560
that you can break through all chains

610
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:55,040
and create your own future.

611
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,310
I...

612
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,280
I don't understand.

613
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,280
I have to go now.

614
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,160
Dad, where are you going?

615
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,920
I'm glad

616
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,040
to see you one last time.

617
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:19,920
Dad...

618
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,190
I will give you all my memories.

619
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,230
Wake up

620
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,430
when you have found out the truth.

621
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,710
No, no.

622
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,310
No!

623
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,350
He's still alive.

624
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,280
You... You're awake.

625
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:26,640
I can feel my dad's agony.

626
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,070
Are you still Ma Hong Jun?

627
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,110
He suffered all his life because of you.

628
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:37,430
His heart was full of holes.

629
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,470
Why?

630
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,160
Why did you do that to him?

631
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,040
I... It's for...

632
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,310
It's to awaken the Evil Phoenix.

633
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:50,040
It's for the rise of our tribe!

634
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,070
Evil Phoenix...

635
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,160
Just because of that,

636
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,070
you killed my father,

637
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,800
and ruined my home.

638
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,040
Hong Jun...

639
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,430
Listen to me.

640
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,760
Since you want
the Evil Phoenix's power so much...

641
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,040
I'll let you have it.

642
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,430
I know you're in pain.

643
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,680
But you have to calm down!

644
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,080
Ma Hong Jun!

645
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,760
It's over...

646
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,230
He has completely lost control.

647
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:24,520
When the Evil Phoenix loses control,

648
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,320
he will...

649
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,280
He will become a madman
that burns everything to a crisp!

650
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:29,630
Kill him, kill him.

651
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,950
Otherwise, we will all be dead!

652
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,150
Blue Silver Plant is powerless
against flames.

653
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,670
Let me do it.

654
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,040
<i>White Tiger Intense Light Wave!</i>

655
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,360
Nether Spikes can't reach him.

656
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,230
This power far exceeds

657
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,040
the maximal power of two Soul Rings.

658
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,760
How did it turn out like this?

659
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,000
It's over...

660
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,670
Everything is done for.

661
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,710
If this continues,

662
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,910
this village will be burnt to ashes!

663
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,670
That's right. I have a solution!

664
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,560
I have a solution!
