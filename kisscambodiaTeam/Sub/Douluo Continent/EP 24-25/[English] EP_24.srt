Two of them are missing.

15
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,080
Over there.

16
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,760
Constraint of Spider Web.

17
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,840
What is this?

18
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,239
There'll be greater despair

19
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:47,079
after we gave some hope to it.

20
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,840
Everything should come to an end.

00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,159
Phoenix Firing Line!

White Tiger Protection Barrier!

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,999
Let her go.

24
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,000
It'll be wise not to struggle.

25
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,959
At least, you won't suffer.

26
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,040
Enough with the pep talk.

27
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,360
Kill them all.

28
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
Now is the time!

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,279
White Tiger Intense Light Wave!

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,040
Blue Silver Cage!

We won!

32
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,120
We won!

33
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,040
How great!

34
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:08,680
We're the Seven Devils of Shi Lan Ke!

35
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,440
They're just like...

36
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,240
Like us back then.

37
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:37,920
Open the door

38
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,880
and let us in.

39
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,959
We'll leave after we put the stuff.

40
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,519
What're you doing?

41
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,839
They're all here to send us gifts.

42
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,120
They're too passionate.
Who can stand them?

43
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,079
Where are the others?

44
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:51,440
Wu was dragged

45
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,839
into the traditional song and dance
event in Xi Si City.

46
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,800
There are so many people,
I barely managed to escape.

47
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:55,680
Where's Dai Mu Bai?

48
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,240
Brother Dai is inside.

49
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:00,599
Headmaster said his hand
is recovering fast.

50
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:01,480
We'll leave in these days.

51
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,719
Okay, I'm going to check on him.

52
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,120
Is anyone there?

53
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,079
Open the door.

54
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,959
Brother Dai, I...

55
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,399
Why are you here?

56
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,519
I asked Brother Dai out

57
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,839
because I like him.

58
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,000
You really like him?

59
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:28,480
I'm hesitating.

60
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,279
Hesitate? What're you hesitating about?

61
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:32,880
You're hesitating if you should like him?

62
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,759
You saved me twice.

63
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,279
You are very capable too.

64
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,159
You have a bright future.

65
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,079
If it was not because of
Martial Soul Hall,

66
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,880
I might have chosen you.

67
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,399
Choose me for what?

68
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,159
What does it have to do
with Martial Soul Hall?

69
00:13:59,159 --> 00:13:59,959
Tang San,

70
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,560
I hope in the future,

71
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,519
we will never be on the opposite sides.

72
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:19,920
You...

73
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,759
You were pretending to be asleep?

74
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,120
I was trying to hold in,

75
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
so I dare not breathe.

76
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,040
She had been staring at me like that.

77
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,040
It was abnormal.

78
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,759
She likes you, doesn't she?

79
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,959
Definitely no.

80
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:50,240
That feeling

81
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,040
is like a hunter looking at his prey.

82
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,759
You can feel it even with
your eyes closed?

83
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,199
Of course.

84
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:57,519
I was born a hunter.

85
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,000
This kind of sense is nothing to me.

86
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,000
Where are the others?

87
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,079
They're attending
the celebration in Xi Si City.

88
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,040
The people seem to be quite passionate.

89
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:10,599
Then when will we leave?

90
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:11,959
Headmaster said

91
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,279
we can leave anytime when
your condition is stable.

92
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,519
I'm fine now.

93
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:18,560
Tell Headmaster
we can leave anytime.

94
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,199
Brother Dai,

95
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:27,639
I don't know if Hu Lie Na
will come again or not,

96
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,639
do you want me to stay here?

97
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,599
It's okay. Headmaster is here.

98
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,560
What can she do?

99
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,800
Kill me?

100
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,159
All right.

101
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:37,519
How about this?

102
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,120
I'll ask Ou Si Ke to accompany you.

103
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,240
I'll find Headmaster first.

104
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,240
Wait a moment.

105
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,360
All right.

106
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:44,719
Wait for me.

107
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,000
Tang San,

108
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:56,599
come over here for a chat.

109
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,079
Well done for defeating

110
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:11,560
the Fiend Battle Team.

111
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,079
You passed the test.

112
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,759
I didn't challenge the Fiend Battle Team

113
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:17,320
for the test that you had given me.

114
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,800
I look only at the result.

115
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,279
Your true intention

116
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:22,560
is not that simple.

117
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,639
Don't you get it now?

118
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,519
I was just following the orders
from the headquarters

119
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,399
to make use of their hatred

120
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:30,680
and bring them together

121
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,920
to do the things that
they believed were right.

122
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,880
I told them that much

123
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:36,959
just to give Wang Sheng's team

124
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,000
a goal.

125
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,480
The truth is

126
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,399
you don't care about them at all.

127
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,759
You just gave them an excuse.

128
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:45,959
All the sanctimonious talk

129
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,320
is just a lie for you to use the drugs

130
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,759
that caused mutation of Martial Soul

131
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,839
on the Fiend Battle Team to turn them into

132
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:52,639
your puppets.

133
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,759
You're smart and I admire that.

134
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,599
We are on the same path.

135
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,759
I can put up with you even if you're

136
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,560
being disrespectful to me.

137
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,440
So, what are your true intentions?

138
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,360
I can only say that so far,

139
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,000
the first step is to
win the championship

140
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,999
in the Soul Master School Contest.

141
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:15,080
I heard

142
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,519
that Tian Dou Imperial School
is also interested in you.

143
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,680
This is good.

144
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,759
After all, there'll be a battle between
Cang Hui and Tian Dou.

145
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,320
You will play an important role then.

146
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:29,080
Is the real master behind Cang Hui

147
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,720
the Hao Tian Soul Master?

148
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,560
Of course.

149
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:32,840
Can I see him?

150
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,399
You can see him

151
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,639
as long as you get into the final of

152
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,680
the Soul Master School Contest.

153
00:17:38,879 --> 00:17:39,960
I see you as one of us.

154
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,639
That's why I told you this.

155
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:43,759
I've said what I can.

156
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:45,680
There are things that you shouldn't know

157
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,680
because you are not qualified yet.

158
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,800
Or you don't believe me?

159
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,999
To be honest, I don't trust you.

160
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,239
I don't need your trust,
your obedient will do.

161
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,840
Not to obey me, but to the headquarters.

162
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,840
Otherwise, you'll end up dead

163
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,519
just like Bu Le.

164
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,680
You killed Bu Le?

165
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,960
I didn't want to kill him.

166
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,119
I was ordered by the headquarters.

167
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,320
Anyone who spills the secret must die.

168
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,560
Including you and me.

169
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:27,440
You!

170
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,399
I have to remind you.

171
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,960
It's impossible

172
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,359
for you to get into the final now.

173
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,720
You have to be stronger if

174
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,600
you want to see Hao Tian Soul Master.

175
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,639
I can't let everyone risk it with me.

176
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,040
I have to finish the rest of
the path on my own.

177
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,960
The people are happier now

178
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,159
without the Fiend Battle Team.

179
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,720
I always think about

180
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:13,960
what is the purpose for
Soul Masters to be stronger?

181
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:16,399
Is it to have a more astonishing ability

182
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:18,519
or for wealth and power?

183
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:20,359
Is there a right answer?

184
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,279
Everyone's answer is different.

185
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,720
But there are many Soul Masters

186
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,840
who lost themselves in the process of

187
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,720
getting stronger.

188
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,960
If the purpose of being strong

189
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:28,359
is for such smiles,

190
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:30,359
the result may be different.

191
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:33,479
To be strong for others.

192
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,720
I've never thought about it.

193
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,040
You can think about it on the way.

194
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,960
You need to find your own goals.

195
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:47,560
Brother San. Brother San?

196
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:49,960
You seem to have a lot on your mind.

197
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,279
Not at all.

198
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,040
Shall I watch Wu for you in the future?

199
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:55,359
What?

200
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,399
If Wu talks to other boys in the future,

201
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,359
I'll stop her for you.

202
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:00,999
Why is that?

203
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:01,999
I'm helping you!

204
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,879
Why are you helping me?

205
00:20:05,399 --> 00:20:06,080
Brother San.

206
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,840
This thing,

207
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:10,239
where did you get it?

208
00:20:11,639 --> 00:20:13,519
I've promised my dad not to tell.

209
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:15,519
Okay, it'll do as well since you can make it.

210
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,359
Have you ever considered
selling it to us?

211
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,159
This is free. I'll give it to you.

212
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:22,519
No, this is not what I want.

213
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:25,800
I want to buy your workmanship
of making the Godly Godly Crossbow.

214
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:27,960
Soul Masters from the Support Branch
don't have the ability to kill.

215
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:29,519
So this Godly Crossbow is a

216
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,440
perfect tool for us.

217
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,879
Although the Godly Crossbow

218
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,200
is very powerful, its power is limited.

219
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:36,960
How do you know?

220
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,399
Recently, I've borrowed

221
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:39,600
Tang San's Godly Crossbow and tried it out.

222
00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:40,680
I found that its speed

223
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,920
and strength are too weak

224
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,800
to be used to deal with those with
Five Soul Rings and above.

225
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:45,680
It'll be hard to deal with
those with Four Soul Rings,

226
00:20:45,879 --> 00:20:47,560
especially the Soul Sect
with defense expertise,

227
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,519
not to mention to break their defense.

228
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:52,320
But even so, it's still strong.

229
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,279
Sell it to us.

230
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,239
I never thought about selling this.

231
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:57,239
Take your time, because I have to

232
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:58,759
show it to my dad in Tian Dou City.

233
00:20:58,999 --> 00:20:59,920
Only then can I set a price.

234
00:21:00,399 --> 00:21:01,800
You'll be rich in no time.

235
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:04,119
Rong Rong, how about my stick?

236
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:04,840
Do you want it?

237
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,040
Your stick?

238
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,399
You can keep it for yourself.

239
00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:09,600
Didn't you see?
It can shoot out smoke and fire.

240
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,759
Rong Rong, wait for me.

241
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:12,440
Rong Rong.

242
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,399
Tang San, what's going on with you?

243
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:19,960
Did that person show up in Xi Si City?

244
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:22,040
Sir, how can you tell?

245
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,040
It was written all on your face.

246
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:26,600
No matter what happens,

247
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,999
you have us by your side.

248
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,279
Sir, I want to get into the final

249
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:33,200
of the Soul Master School Contest.

250
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,479
Do you think I can make it?

251
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:37,920
Of course, but

252
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,600
you're not fighting alone.

253
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,399
Seven Devils of Shi Lan Ke
is a team of Soul Masters,

254
00:21:42,879 --> 00:21:44,359
and I have faith in this team of yours.

255
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,440
You can focus on preparing the battle
after we reach Tian Dou City.

256
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:48,960
Headmaster and I will think of a way

257
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,119
for you to meet qualifications
of the contest.

258
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,359
I have made plans about

259
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,759
the flow of the contest.

260
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:55,279
I'll remind you about the match system
and the strategies.

261
00:21:55,639 --> 00:21:56,960
I'll also analyze your opponents

262
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,759
in the contest.

263
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,159
If you have set a goal
to enter the final,

264
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,279
then you should work hard for it,

265
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:02,800
kid.

266
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,879
I can't see

267
00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:09,479
the desire to win on your face.

268
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:11,800
Then why must you enter the final?

269
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,479
That person said my dad
might show himself.

270
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:19,960
We should

271
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:22,200
talk about this privately after
we reach Tian Dou City.

272
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:25,239
Let's go.

273
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,879
We can get out of trouble one day.

274
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:41,999
At that time,

275
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:44,080
I'll tie all people in the city here

276
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,479
to kill them all under the burning sun.

277
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,600
Yes, they deserve to die.

278
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:52,519
They deserve it.

279
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,399
The sandstorm is coming.

280
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,440
Master Ye Zhi Qiu, you're here.

281
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,800
We have disappointed you.

282
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,999
Please give us another chance.

283
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,920
I can't say I'm disappointed.

284
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,040
Master Ye, Master Ye.

285
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:32,680
We'll fight it back after we recover.

286
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:35,519
Are you Tang San's friend?

287
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,440
Yes.

288
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,479
Tang San is the one who
turned us into this.

289
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,200
It's also due to Wang Sheng's
incompetence.

290
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:44,239
Master Ye, just leave him here,

291
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,080
and let him die on his own.

292
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:46,999
We can go now.

293
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,080
Go?

294
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,639
Where to?

295
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,560
Find a place to treat our wounds.

296
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:52,720
There's no need.

297
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:55,560
But we can't use Martial Soul

298
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,479
in such conditions.

299
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:12,639
Master Ye, what's going on?

300
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,639
Your mission is over.

301
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,440
Master Ye, give us another...

302
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,759
How long have you known Tang San?

303
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,479
I knew him from the Beginner
Soul Master School in Nuoding City.

304
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,399
Who are the parents of him and Wu?

305
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,879
I don't know. I only know

306
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:43,560
that Tang San's father is a blacksmith.

307
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:47,159
Where did he get the
weapons that he used

308
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,399
to defeat you?

309
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,359
He made them himself.

310
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,600
How did he know all these?

311
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,119
I don't know.

312
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:55,879
That is to say,

313
00:24:56,639 --> 00:24:57,920
actually, you know nothing.

314
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,119
No, Tang San worked in a smithy.

315
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,920
Yes, he forged iron before.

316
00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:06,320
Worthless information.

317
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:09,440
Master Ye, I'm loyal to Cang Hui.

318
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,999
I'm willing to do anything.

319
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,680
I'm willing to be at your service.

320
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,080
Be at my service? You?

321
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,080
I'm a Mutant Soul.

322
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,440
Is Mutant Soul valuable?

323
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,119
We can have as many Mutant Souls
as we want.

324
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:27,080
We can make Mutant Souls

325
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,200
as long as we have the drugs.

326
00:25:29,639 --> 00:25:31,440
But you clearly said that

327
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,399
we are fighting to
change the fate.

328
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,999
If I didn't say this,

329
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,639
how could I make

330
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:39,920
you all work hard?

331
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:43,720
Is... is this a lie?

332
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,879
You only get it now?

333
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:48,800
No, Master Ye.

334
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,879
I'm begging you, don't kill me.

335
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:52,040
Master Ye.

336
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,759
I'm begging you, please don't kill me.

337
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,800
Actually,

338
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,560
I don't want to kill you.

339
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,680
I can work for you.

340
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,399
I'm very useful, please don't kill me.

341
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,320
The world is like this.

342
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:10,399
The truth is always cruel.

343
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:12,359
Master Ye, please don't kill me.

344
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,399
I'm begging you, don't kill me, Master...

345
00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:21,720
I'm just like you.

346
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,560
Nothing but a tool.

347
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,399
Tools

348
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,320
are meant to be controlled
and used by others.

349
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,279
Nobody can escape it.

350
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:49,639
I'm exhausted.

351
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,920
This is the capital of Tian Dou Empire,

352
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:54,040
Tian Dou City.

353
00:26:58,999 --> 00:26:59,960
It's huge.

354
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:02,040
How many people live here?

355
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:05,479
Countless people are coming in and
out of Tian Dou City every day.

356
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,680
It's undoubtedly the center
of the empire.

357
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,800
We should hurry to

358
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:10,560
Tian Dou Imperial School
before it gets dark.

359
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,440
Don't stay in the wild
at night anymore.

360
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,879
That's great. I can finally take a bath.

361
00:27:15,879 --> 00:27:16,759
Bath?

362
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,800
Let's go.

363
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:19,999
Headmaster,

364
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,399
isn't it this way?

365
00:27:21,479 --> 00:27:23,399
Who told you the Imperial School
is in the city?

366
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,479
It's over here.

367
00:27:25,879 --> 00:27:26,960
Bath, bath, bath.

368
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,800
Hurry up, Rong Rong.

369
00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:30,920
You didn't talk much since
we left Xi Si City.

370
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,239
I'm fine.

371
00:28:12,639 --> 00:28:14,080
Everyone, we are here at last.

372
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,960
In front is Tian Dou Imperial School.

373
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,239
Which part of it is the school?

374
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,639
The whole mountain.

375
00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:21,879
What?

376
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,519
All of the Martial Soul research fields,

377
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,759
Soul Beast research departments,

378
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,999
Soul Arenas,

379
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,200
and facilities that you can
think of are here.

380
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,960
Now you know why the school

381
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,840
is not in the city.

382
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,399
Because it's too huge.

383
00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:35,320
Wow, that's so cool.

384
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,479
It's not just the school is huge,

385
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,279
the students are strong too.

386
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,720
Then such a huge school

387
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,680
must be better than our school.

388
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,560
What are you saying?

389
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,080
How can you admit defeat
before you fight?

390
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,519
That's right.

391
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,800
Okay, okay, keep up.

392
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,720
Hurry up.

393
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:58,200
What can I do for you?

394
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,960
We're from Shi Lan Ke School. We were invited.

395
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,440
Shi Lan Ke School?

396
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,320
I've never heard of it.

397
00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:09,239
It's a small school. It's normal
that you haven't heard of it.

398
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,359
Who invited you?

399
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,519
Yu Tian Heng.

400
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,639
Senior Yu?

401
00:29:15,639 --> 00:29:17,399
Please wait here, I'll report it.

402
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:27,960
Are you crying?

403
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,399
Ou Si Ke.

404
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,479
I never thought that

405
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,639
I can come to Tian Dou Imperial School.

406
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,080
Dad,

407
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,560
you passed your Martial Soul to me.

408
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:46,279
I will carry your strength and spirit

409
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,200
to live a better life.

410
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,759
I won't give up.

411
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:57,560
I won't give up, either.

412
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,960
I wanted to be an artist
since I was young.

413
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,119
I never thought that

414
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:04,600
I'll have the chance to
come to Tian Dou City.

415
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,359
Tian Dou City has the treasure of art

416
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,239
and it is a sacred place
for all of the performers.

417
00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:13,239
Hong Jun, you know what?

418
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,320
Don't give up.

419
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,440
Don't give up.

420
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,279
Try your best.

421
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:22,840
Try your best.

422
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,320
You can do it!

423
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,440
Everybody, please follow me.

424
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,479
Let's go.

425
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,720
We are Shi Lan Ke School, remember it.

426
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,040
It's huge. How great!

427
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:48,920
Come inside, please.

428
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:01,119
Have a seat, please.

429
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,560
I'll inform Senior Yu.

430
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,080
Their... Their

431
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,479
classroom is too big.

432
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,080
This is their classroom, right?

433
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:13,960
So big.

434
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,759
This is not a classroom.

435
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,479
This is just a reception hall.

436
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,560
Reception hall? This big?

437
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:20,519
There are a few reception halls

438
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:21,600
like this in the school.

439
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:23,040
How did you know?

440
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,200
Of course I know.

441
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:25,600
My dad brought me here before.

442
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,960
I'm the little princess of
Qibao Amber Clan.

443
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:29,479
Let's sit down.

444
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:30,800
Let's sit.

445
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:36,040
Tang San.

446
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,159
Is this edible?

447
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:42,920
Yes, it is.

448
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,320
Do you want to eat?

449
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:48,399
Here, have a bite.

450
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,080
I'll eat by myself.

451
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,279
We've been eating dried food
throughout the journey.

452
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,840
Here, Tang San.

453
00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,720
Have this one.

454
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:03,519
Tang San, hand me the water.

455
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,359
I choked.

456
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,159
Eat slowly.

457
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,320
I'm very hungry.

458
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,879
Finally, I have some fresh fruit to eat.

459
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,960
Are both of you all right?

460
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:17,639
Look, I'll show you a performance.

461
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,239
Cool!

462
00:32:24,479 --> 00:32:26,320
Hu Lie Na, why aren't you eating?

463
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:30,999
Up to her.

464
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,519
Where are the mysterious masters?

465
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:34,279
Mysterious masters?

466
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:36,720
Mys... Mys...

467
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,600
Are you all

468
00:32:45,879 --> 00:32:47,720
invited by Senior Yu, Yu Tian Heng?

469
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,840
We...we...

470
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,519
Yes, we are.

471
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,720
I heard Senior Yu have invited
some mysterious masters

472
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,879
to join our Imperial Battle Team.

473
00:32:57,639 --> 00:32:58,560
I wonder when they will arrive.

474
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:01,119
We have already arrived.
Here, eat this.

475
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,080
Why you?

476
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,279
What's wrong with us?

477
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,279
You can ask Senior Yu.

478
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:10,200
Everyone is here.

479
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,600
Junior, you are here as well.

480
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:14,999
Headmaster Lan,

481
00:33:15,239 --> 00:33:16,279
let's go to the
Academic Affairs Department.

482
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:18,279
The chief of the Academic Affairs Department
is waiting for you.

483
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:20,320
Okay, stop eating.

484
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:21,080
Let's go.

485
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:21,800
Okay.

486
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:23,840
Senior,

487
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:25,399
you invited these people

488
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:26,879
to join our Imperial Team?

489
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,159
Yes.

490
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:30,399
I'll introduce each of them
to you later.

491
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,759
I have to go to the
Academic Affairs Department first.

492
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:32,960
Senior Yu,

493
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:35,239
we have so many talents

494
00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:36,080
in Tian Dou Imperial School.

495
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,200
It's more than enough to
form two battle teams.

496
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,440
Of course, I would agree if you asked

497
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:42,119
the strong ones to join

498
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,359
for the fame of the school.

499
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,560
But you're letting these guys

500
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,639
replace

501
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:48,800
the students of our school.

502
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:50,840
What are you talking about?

503
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:52,800
You all invited me.

504
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,840
I haven't agreed yet.

505
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,479
That means you still have some

506
00:33:55,479 --> 00:33:56,359
self-consciousness.

507
00:33:57,479 --> 00:33:59,239
That's because I'm afraid that
some teams are too weak

508
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:00,239
and they will affect me.

509
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:01,759
How dare you look down on us!

510
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:02,519
We're Tian Dou Imperial School!

511
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,399
You look down

512
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:04,479
on our Shi Lan Ke School first.

513
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,440
What a small school is that?

514
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,920
I have never heard of it!

515
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,359
How dare you come

516
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:11,600
to mix with us in our Imperial School?

517
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,080
Your Senior

518
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,279
begged us here.

519
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:14,999
You!

520
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,880
What are you doing? Come here!

521
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,080
What are you doing?

522
00:34:22,759 --> 00:34:23,279
Senior.

523
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,919
They are not qualified
to join our teams.

524
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,880
The qualification is judged by
the Academic Affairs Department.

525
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,279
Is this how

526
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:29,439
the Imperial School treats their guests?

527
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,239
I'm sorry, everyone.

528
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,400
Xue Beng has royal blood in him.

529
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,040
He has deep feelings for the school

530
00:34:46,439 --> 00:34:47,439
and he doesn't know you all well.

531
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,600
I'll scold him later.

532
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,800
Is his name Xue Beng?

533
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:54,199
From the name, we can tell
his temper must be bad.

534
00:34:55,439 --> 00:34:56,199
But it's true that

535
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:57,519
we look shabby.

536
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,640
It's no wonder that he misunderstood us.

537
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,880
It's my bad.

538
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,679
I should let you all change first.

539
00:35:02,999 --> 00:35:04,439
How about this? I'll bring you all

540
00:35:04,439 --> 00:35:05,479
to clean up at the quarters.

541
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:07,679
Are they all waiting for us?

542
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,640
Yes.

543
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:09,999
The chief of Academic Affairs Department
is waiting personally.

544
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,279
It'll be rude

545
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:13,120
to drag this any longer.

546
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:13,759
Let's do this.

547
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,719
We'll bring

548
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:15,919
Tang San and Dai Mu Bai first.

549
00:35:15,919 --> 00:35:17,479
Others can rest up here.

550
00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:18,719
Okay then, I'll show you the way.

551
00:35:18,919 --> 00:35:19,439
All right.

552
00:35:20,759 --> 00:35:21,279
Let's go.

553
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,400
Hong Jun.

554
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:27,679
I'm telling you

555
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:29,439
that the yellow fruit is very delicious.

556
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,999
