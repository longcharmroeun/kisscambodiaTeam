14
00:01:43,481 --> 00:01:44,360
You're not going to save her?

15
00:01:44,441 --> 00:01:45,761
No, I won't!

16
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:47,400
I... I'm no match for you.

17
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,241
She treats me badly

18
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:50,680
and she'll always yell at me anyway.

19
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,761
You're surrendering.

20
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:55,161
But why should I accept it?

21
00:01:55,521 --> 00:01:56,441
I... I...

22
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:58,040
I'm obedient.

23
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,801
I'm also very likable.

24
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,400
I'll perform something for you.

25
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:03,640
What nonsense are you talking about?

26
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,801
Rocketing Kiwi!

27
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:09,841
Are you surprised?

28
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:10,720
It's edible.

29
00:02:12,761 --> 00:02:13,521
Are you surprised?

30
00:02:17,081 --> 00:02:17,681
Isn't it impressive?

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,881
It's really sweet.

32
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:32,920
What a brat.

33
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,360
That hurts.

34
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,801
If it hurts,

35
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:43,241
why did you step forward?

36
00:02:43,401 --> 00:02:44,280
I was the only one at that time.

37
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,920
Who would save you if I didn't?

38
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:50,720
But actually,

39
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:53,321
it doesn't hurt that much.

40
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,720
It will be fine soon.

41
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,360
You don't have to worry about me.

42
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,441
Idiot. No one is worried about you.

43
00:02:57,801 --> 00:02:59,161
I'm really smart, you know?

44
00:02:59,441 --> 00:02:59,840
Didn't you see

45
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,200
how I tricked the old man?

46
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,081
Or we couldn't have escaped.

47
00:03:04,161 --> 00:03:04,920
Idiot.

48
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,961
Stop calling me an idiot.

49
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,881
I did exceptionally well today.

50
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:10,760
Okay?

51
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:15,601
Thank you.

52
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,321
This is bad.

53
00:03:18,961 --> 00:03:19,521
What's wrong?

54
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,560
Fifteen minutes!

55
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,681
Rong Rong, don't be mad.

56
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:28,521
I was in a rush,

57
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:29,720
so I forgot the time.

58
00:03:30,801 --> 00:03:32,241
It's okay. I'm not mad.

59
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,241
Come on. Let's head back to the school.

60
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:37,081
This is not right.

61
00:03:37,401 --> 00:03:38,640
You must be really mad now.

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,441
You're going to get back at me later.

63
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,681
I'm really not mad.

64
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:43,881
I think you are.

65
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,441
If you are mad now,

66
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:47,321
just vent it out already.

67
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:49,681
Or I would constantly be on edge.

68
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:51,760
Idiot.

69
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:54,801
Enough. Get up.

70
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,161
Let's head back.

71
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:57,881
What...

72
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,200
What did you say when we were up in the sky?

73
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:08,041
Rong Rong, Rong Rong!

74
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,041
Here is the voucher for 2,500 Gold Soul Coins.

75
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,000
It should be correct.

76
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,401
Thank you.

77
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,480
There's no problem with the plaque, either.

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,720
But

79
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:23,721
you still have to pay

80
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:24,920
five percent of the handling fee.

81
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,081
This...

82
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,281
I will pay

83
00:04:31,281 --> 00:04:32,160
for his handling fee.

84
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:41,121
If that is so, we are done here.

85
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:42,160
Thank you.

86
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:58,001
Uncle Ning, thank you.

87
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,561
You gave Rong Rong the Silk Woven Tulip

88
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,920
to help with her Martial Soul's mutation

89
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:07,760
and completed Jiubao Amber Pagoda.

90
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,920
These 2,500 Gold Soul Coins

91
00:05:10,521 --> 00:05:11,561
will be my gift for you.

92
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:14,480
Uncle Ning, Rong Rong has been missing.

93
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,600
We are still looking for her.

94
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,040
Since I've given you the money,

95
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:20,561
she is not going back
to Shi Lan Ke School.

96
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:21,081
Of course,

97
00:05:21,841 --> 00:05:23,360
she won't take part in the contest, either.

98
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,081
So Rong Rong was taken away by you.

99
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:29,760
Please stop finding her from now on.

100
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:30,721
Oh, right.

101
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,281
Let me remind you.

102
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:34,121
The registration is closing soon.

103
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:36,440
Let's find Headmaster and register.

104
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:44,081
Hurry up.

105
00:05:45,121 --> 00:05:45,521
That way.

106
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:51,200
Quick, quick!

107
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,001
Excuse me!

108
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,600
Excuse me.

109
00:05:57,801 --> 00:05:59,040
There are 2,500 Gold Soul Coins.

110
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:01,681
We'd like to pay for Lanba School's debt.

111
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,521
Payment received.

112
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,320
You are in.

113
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,640
This is great!

114
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,440
I'd like to change the name of
Lanba School

115
00:06:12,241 --> 00:06:13,160
to Shi Lan Ke.

116
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:14,920
Please fill it in here.

117
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,480
Here.

118
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,760
Wu, what are you looking for?

119
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,841
I'm worried that Prince Xue Xing
might cause trouble again.

120
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,841
Right now,

121
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:28,360
he has no reason to stop us.

122
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:12,640
His Highness is here.

123
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,360
The contest is about to start.

124
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,121
I will win this.

125
00:07:25,121 --> 00:07:26,760
I have arranged the opening match for you.

126
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:28,721
They will be your opponents.

127
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,401
Shi Lan Ke School.

128
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,160
The information on all Shi Lan Ke students

129
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,281
is written here.

130
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,920
Basically, they are Triple Soul Rings

131
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,040
and a useless Martial Soul
with Blue Silver Plant.

132
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,920
A weakling like him

133
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,920
is no match for me.

134
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,081
It's the school led by Xue Qing He.

135
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,480
Tai Long.

136
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,801
I saved your tribe.

137
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:51,121
Yes.

138
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,040
We'll always remember your kindness.

139
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,401
Finish them

140
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,241
in the first battle then.

141
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,121
Headmaster.

142
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,241
In the auction,

143
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,920
it was Ning Feng Zhi
who bought the herbs.

144
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,040
He is Rong Rong's father.

145
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,001
He said he would not let her come back.

146
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,160
He's probably the one who took her away.

147
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,920
This is not entirely bad news.

148
00:08:14,081 --> 00:08:15,160
At least we now know,

149
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,401
Rong Rong is safe.

150
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,721
Are we not going to get Rong Rong back?

151
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:21,401
We are a school.

152
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:23,081
It's completely reasonable

153
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:24,521
for parents to bring back their children.

154
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,561
They should at least
let us know beforehand.

155
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,320
They probably have their reasons.

156
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,480
Dad.

157
00:08:33,081 --> 00:08:33,640
Tang San.

158
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:35,721
I saved Rong Rong.

159
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:37,480
A brat from Shi Lan Ke

160
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,081
took Rong Rong away?

161
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:40,560
From you?

162
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,081
That brat is pretty interesting.

163
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:44,081
He's of Support Branch too.

164
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:45,120
And he could fly.

165
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:47,440
But you are the Grand Soul Land Master
with Nine Soul Rings.

166
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,760
Even if he could fly,

167
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,320
you are capable of stopping him.

168
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:52,401
Rong Rong wanted to go anyway.

169
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:56,440
You let them go deliberately, right?

170
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,921
I guessed it right away.

171
00:08:59,481 --> 00:09:00,921
Well, this old man

172
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,120
must be trying to lay hold of Rong Rong

173
00:09:02,601 --> 00:09:03,680
to threaten her father.

174
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,841
I fought real hard

175
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,560
to rescue her out.

176
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,760
It's not a big deal.

177
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,841
I made it in no time.

178
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,841
That's not right, Ou Si Ke.

179
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:13,041
Wu and I saw Rong Rong's father

180
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:13,921
in the auction.

181
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,161
He said he took Rong Rong away.

182
00:09:19,721 --> 00:09:22,921
That... That old man is not a bad guy?

183
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,081
That's Grandpa Sword.

184
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,120
His name is Chen Xin.

185
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:27,721
He's the elder in our clan.

186
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,200
Then, he's pretty strong.

187
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:32,560
He's not only strong,

188
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,120
but also a Nine Soul Rings Soul Master.

189
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,161
Grand Soul Land Master.

190
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,161
His sword skills are phenomenal.

191
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:41,760
He's the Sword Master.

192
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,961
I saved Rong Rong

193
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,161
from a Grand Soul Land Master.

194
00:09:49,161 --> 00:09:50,320
At that time, the lad

195
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,041
had the sword pointing at his heart.

196
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,401
But he didn't care about his life.

197
00:09:54,401 --> 00:09:55,601
He still went forward.

198
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:57,041
Saving Rong Rong was the only thought
in his mind.

199
00:09:57,521 --> 00:09:59,041
This contest is dangerous.

200
00:09:59,041 --> 00:09:59,601
Do you know that?

201
00:09:59,961 --> 00:10:00,560
All right...

202
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:00,921
Come on.

203
00:10:00,921 --> 00:10:01,800
Have a seat.

204
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,161
Don't be mad.

205
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:09,200
Do you remember when you were young?

206
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,440
You fought together with your good friends.

207
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,721
Strong opponents could never intimidate you.

208
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:15,800
Back then,

209
00:10:16,361 --> 00:10:17,640
if you were to back down from difficulties,

210
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,120
you wouldn't have been

211
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,680
the chief of Qibao Amber Clan.

212
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:26,760
Young people

213
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,880
have their own journeys to go through.

214
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:30,240
You have to let go of their hands

215
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:31,880
so they could shine their own light.

216
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,640
Give me your hand.

217
00:10:44,841 --> 00:10:45,721
Your hand.

218
00:10:48,921 --> 00:10:50,081
Headmaster said it.

219
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,401
Grandpa Sword intended to lose.

220
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,281
Or both of us

221
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:55,521
couldn't have escaped.

222
00:10:59,320 --> 00:10:59,880
Will...

223
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,961
Will your dad want you back again?

224
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:05,401
I don't know.

225
00:11:06,521 --> 00:11:07,120
But

226
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,800
if he wanted to do that,

227
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,880
he would have caught up with us.

228
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,961
You're right.

229
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,401
Why are you laughing?

230
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,161
You almost died.

231
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,120
Right.

232
00:11:19,361 --> 00:11:21,041
It's terrifying now that I think of it.

233
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,320
Stop being so reckless next time.

234
00:11:24,361 --> 00:11:25,880
If I didn't get reckless,

235
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,640
what if they were real bad guys?

236
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,961
How could I save you if I was not reckless?

237
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,081
Thank you.

238
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,161
What? You...

239
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,440
You just thanked me.

240
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,800
Before we fell,

241
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,281
you said that too.

242
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:44,800
Shut up.

243
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,800
Sit tight.

244
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:51,320
I won't go.

245
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,281
Didn't you ask

246
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,161
whether my dad would come for me?

247
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,760
If he really does,

248
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,760
I won't go.

249
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,120
That's a given.

250
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,560
We are the Seven Devils of Shi Lan Ke!

251
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,521
We need each of us.

252
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,921
Idiot.

253
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,921
We just received the news.

254
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,640
For Soul Master School Contest,

255
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,601
our first opponent has been decided.

256
00:12:21,601 --> 00:12:23,000
It's Tian Dou Imperial School's Second Squad.

257
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,281
What a coincidence.

258
00:12:25,841 --> 00:12:27,161
Tian Dou Imperial School's Second Squad

259
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:28,680
was trained by Prince Xue Xing.

260
00:12:29,361 --> 00:12:30,760
So they want us to lose.

261
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,521
But there's one thing they don't know.

262
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:35,120
It's that Tang San and the rest

263
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,000
have full Soul Power.

264
00:12:36,601 --> 00:12:37,880
They can advance their Soul Rings.

265
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,841
Advancing before the contest

266
00:12:41,841 --> 00:12:42,841
is against the clock.

267
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,680
We won't reach Star Forest in time.

268
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,120
Sunset Forest.

269
00:13:21,081 --> 00:13:22,481
Soul Beasts in Sunset Forest

270
00:13:22,481 --> 00:13:23,361
are relatively lesser.

271
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,921
So we can't hunt together.

272
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,880
We'll be in groups from now on.

273
00:13:27,401 --> 00:13:29,120
Dai Mu Bai, Zhu Zhu Qing, Ma Hong Jun.

274
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,760
You three will follow Headmaster.

275
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:32,880
Ou Si Ke, Ning Rong Rong.

276
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:33,841
Both of you are of Support Branch.

277
00:13:34,401 --> 00:13:34,961
You two will be a team

278
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,161
along with Ms. Liu Er Long.

279
00:13:37,481 --> 00:13:38,120
Tang San and Wu.

280
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:38,880
You two are with me.

281
00:13:40,401 --> 00:13:41,161
I oppose.

282
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,361
I don't know the way.

283
00:13:42,361 --> 00:13:43,200
I can't lead the team alone.

284
00:13:43,401 --> 00:13:44,560
Back then, your sense of direction

285
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,680
was much better than Luo San Pao.

286
00:13:47,281 --> 00:13:48,440
Do you have a problem?

287
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,401
I don't.

288
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,081
How about this?

289
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,401
I'll leave Luo San Pao with you

290
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,320
to lead the way.

291
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,841
There's no need for that.

292
00:13:54,841 --> 00:13:56,081
Both of us can be a team.

293
00:13:56,721 --> 00:13:58,120
Rong Rong, Ou Si Ke.

294
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,281
Both of you will be with Headmaster.

295
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,200
He's the strongest

296
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,000
in Golden Iron Triangle.

297
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,961
There won't be a problem.

298
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,640
Okay.

299
00:14:05,361 --> 00:14:05,880
It'll be fine.

300
00:14:07,161 --> 00:14:07,961
Yes, it'll be fine.

301
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,320
All right. We have decided.

302
00:14:12,921 --> 00:14:13,361
Let's get going.

303
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,240
Be careful.

304
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,240
Beware.

305
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,921
San, be careful.

306
00:14:17,361 --> 00:14:17,760
Let's go.

307
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:17,961
Come on.

308
00:14:17,961 --> 00:14:18,401
Follow me.

309
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:18,560
Let's go.

310
00:14:28,161 --> 00:14:28,560
Slowly.

311
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,521
Be careful.

312
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,120
This is their training.

313
00:14:53,521 --> 00:14:54,440
We should try not to interfere.

314
00:15:00,481 --> 00:15:02,640
What kind of Soul Beasts should we get

315
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,361
for Tang San's Fourth Soul Ring?

316
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
You'll decide.

317
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,961
Does Master owe Ms. Liu money?

318
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Why does Ms. Liu

319
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,120
keep looking at him like that?

320
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:14,440
I think it's because of their relationship.

321
00:15:15,361 --> 00:15:16,041
What does that mean?

322
00:15:17,841 --> 00:15:20,081
I think Ms. Liu likes him very much.

323
00:15:21,481 --> 00:15:22,601
Ms. Liu is so pretty.

324
00:15:22,841 --> 00:15:23,760
They are a good match.

325
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,440
Look for Soul Beasts
instead of talking nonsense.

326
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,521
How is that nonsense?

327
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,601
Wu, well said.

328
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,200
She has better taste than you.

329
00:15:46,961 --> 00:15:48,120
In Sunset Forest,

330
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,521
there are Phantom Tiger
and Starlight Tiger.

331
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,601
They are suitable for Dai Mu Bai
and Zhu Zhu Qing to advance.

332
00:15:58,401 --> 00:15:59,120
A huge spider.

333
00:15:59,481 --> 00:16:00,481
It's a Human Faced Demon Spider.

334
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:01,440
It's the kind

335
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,800
that Tang San killed in Star Forest.

336
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,041
It ran away.

337
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,401
It probably went to Tang San.

338
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,481
Why?

339
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,281
Human Faced Demon Spider

340
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:15,200
is highly sensitive
to the Qi of its same kind.

341
00:16:15,481 --> 00:16:17,281
Tang San killed one before.

342
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:18,401
Once it finds out about that,

343
00:16:18,721 --> 00:16:20,560
it will see him as the main target.

344
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,240
Should we go and assist Brother San?

345
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,120
It's not necessary.

346
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,841
Ms. Liu Er Long is there.

347
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,120
A spider like that is nothing.

348
00:16:27,841 --> 00:16:28,240
Let's go.

349
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,161
Be careful.

350
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,281
Sister Qing, be careful.

351
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,120
I'll help her.

352
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,640
No.

353
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:57,880
Just watch.

354
00:17:26,601 --> 00:17:27,601
Ms. Liu is amazing.

355
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,520
Her Martial Soul is Scarlet Flame Dragon.

356
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,361
It inflicts high damage.

357
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:34,520
Gang, bring me the pouch.

358
00:17:37,081 --> 00:17:38,601
Wu, you go instead.

359
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,121
But she asked for you.

360
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,481
It's not right for me to go.

361
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,400
Come with me.

362
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,560
Ms. Liu.

363
00:17:57,601 --> 00:17:58,160
Thank you.

364
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,320
Do you have to change

365
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,481
every time you fight?

366
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:07,481
I have gotten used to it.

367
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,881
Ma Hong Jun belongs to the Flame Branch.

368
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:12,800
But his clothes never get burn off.

369
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,160
My Martial Soul is kind of different.

370
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,121
It causes an unusual amount of damage.

371
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,001
So it's less controllable.

372
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,721
So it's not very convenient in battles.

373
00:18:21,641 --> 00:18:23,280
If there are people around after the fight,

374
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,241
I will maintain my Martial Soul

375
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,040
and get changed in somewhere convenient.

376
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,160
Over the years,

377
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,920
besides Gang and other girls,

378
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,081
no one has seen it.

379
00:18:32,601 --> 00:18:33,641
Did Master saw it before?

380
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,721
It was an accident.

381
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,721
We just formed our group,
the Golden Iron Triangle

382
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:37,361
and was traveling the world.

383
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,641
We would get into fights sometimes.

384
00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:40,001
When the opponent was defeated and fled,

385
00:18:40,001 --> 00:18:41,121
Ms. Liu collapsed.

386
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:43,160
It was then I realized she had no clothes on.

387
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,841
So Headmaster saw it too?

388
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:46,601
Lander was chasing the opponent.

389
00:18:47,601 --> 00:18:48,160
There were just me and her.

390
00:18:48,881 --> 00:18:49,440
What happened then?

391
00:18:49,721 --> 00:18:51,200
She fainted, so I had no choice.

392
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,601
I had to find her some clothes
and put them on for her.

393
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:56,841
You put it on for her?

394
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,761
She passed out. What can I do?

395
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,361
He had seen it all at that time.

396
00:19:01,361 --> 00:19:02,761
I was in a dilemma after I woke up.

397
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:04,121
It's either that I beat him up

398
00:19:04,641 --> 00:19:06,040
or get married to him.

399
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,361
Beating him up doesn't sound right.

400
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,641
Since he was helping me.

401
00:19:10,841 --> 00:19:11,440
So...

402
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,560
you decided to marry him?

403
00:19:16,881 --> 00:19:17,601
Unfortunately,

404
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,520
he chose Bi Bi Dong in the end.

405
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,481
Master, you are at fault here.

406
00:19:23,601 --> 00:19:25,320
You put on clothes for her.

407
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,001
It was an emergency.

408
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:30,680
You could have covered her with something.

409
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,440
She could put it on herself

410
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,440
after she woke up.

411
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,560
That sounds right.

412
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:36,560
I was flustered at that time.

413
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,520
I didn't think of that, OK?

414
00:19:42,601 --> 00:19:43,280
It's Human Faced Demon Spider.

415
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,881
Tang San, capture it.

416
00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:47,440
That's the Soul Beast that suits you the best.

417
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,040
It's strange.

418
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,040
You killed its kind before.

419
00:19:54,721 --> 00:19:55,961
It should be attacking you.

420
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,040
Master, should we go after it?

421
00:19:58,001 --> 00:19:58,680
Let's wait for Er Long and Wu.

422
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,001
Why?

423
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,320
There's a Human Faced Demon Spider.

424
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,680
Where?

425
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,361
That way.

426
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,761
Be alert, everyone.

427
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:17,121
It's unusual for it to keep running away.

428
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,400
It's probably scared.

429
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:19,800
Do we lose it?

430
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,761
How strange.

431
00:20:21,761 --> 00:20:23,241
It was running in this direction.

432
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:35,721
This is bad.

433
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,841
Retreat quickly! Back to the forest!

434
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,160
It's Pit Demon Spider.

435
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:46,160
I'll deal with it. Run.

436
00:20:51,361 --> 00:20:52,520
Tang San and Wu, hurry up and run!

437
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,920
Run!

438
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:55,881
Let's go.

439
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:05,361
Spider Web Cage.

440
00:21:05,881 --> 00:21:08,121
It's poisonless but extremely sturdy.

441
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:45,160
I'll help you.

442
00:21:50,121 --> 00:21:50,761
Wu!

443
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,081
Don't move. Be careful of your wound.

444
00:22:24,961 --> 00:22:26,961
It hurts a little but I think I'm okay.

445
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,320
Impossible.

446
00:22:32,361 --> 00:22:33,481
It pierced through this.

447
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,200
It's Lovesick Heartbroken Scarlet.

448
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,881
A flower that could withstand
the Human Faced Demon Spider.

449
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:41,481
Tang San! Wu is fine.

450
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,200
The flower protected me.

451
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:51,920
Absorb the Soul Ring
and you'll be able to advance.

452
00:23:11,121 --> 00:23:11,721
Ms. Liu.

453
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,200
Can I have the Pit Demon Spider?

454
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:14,961
Of course.

455
00:23:17,641 --> 00:23:19,121
Do you want to use the Pit Demon Spider
to advance?

456
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:20,721
You can't.

457
00:23:20,721 --> 00:23:21,440
Judging from its size,

458
00:23:21,761 --> 00:23:23,241
it's more than ten thousand years old.

459
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,481
Its Soul Power is

460
00:23:25,481 --> 00:23:26,121
too strong for you.

461
00:23:26,641 --> 00:23:28,440
You want to absorb such a powerful beast
for your fourth Soul Ring.

462
00:23:29,361 --> 00:23:30,481
It's too risky

463
00:23:30,481 --> 00:23:31,241
and dangerous.

464
00:23:33,081 --> 00:23:33,881
You said that

465
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,121
the contest gathers
many talented Soul Masters.

466
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,280
If I am to enter the final,

467
00:23:37,361 --> 00:23:38,200
I have to take risks.

468
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,241
Only then can I be strong.

469
00:23:39,721 --> 00:23:41,481
But you can't absorb
the Decade Millennium Soul Ring.

470
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,081
This is Ice Fire Mouth Spring.

471
00:23:48,841 --> 00:23:49,881
It can help absorb

472
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:52,121
Soul Beasts that are beyond your power.

473
00:23:53,361 --> 00:23:54,160
In the Interspace,

474
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,001
I have the Ice Fire Mouth Spring

475
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:55,961
that my mother left for me.

476
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,241
It might give me some help.

477
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,560
Headmaster.

478
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,160
Rong Rong and the rest are back.

479
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:01,920
You guys are back.

480
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:05,641
What... What happened to them?

481
00:25:06,481 --> 00:25:07,800
They are being greedy.

482
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,520
They chose the Soul Beasts
that are closest to their limit

483
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,200
in order to advance.

484
00:25:10,721 --> 00:25:11,761
As to when they will wake up,

485
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,881
it'll have to depend on their luck.

486
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,121
We both advanced.

487
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,280
The premium herbs

488
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,560
are indeed powerful.

489
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,920
When Zhu Zhu Qing

490
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,361
and Ma Hong Jun advanced
to Triple Soul Rings,

491
00:25:22,361 --> 00:25:23,641
their Soul Power was still full.

492
00:25:23,641 --> 00:25:25,881
So they all ended up
advancing to Quadruple Soul Rings.

493
00:25:26,361 --> 00:25:27,121
In other words,

494
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,560
we have reached Quadruple Soul Rings.

495
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,040
Everyone.

496
00:25:38,961 --> 00:25:41,680
The Soul Master School Contest
of Douluo Continent

497
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,800
for Tian Dou Empire zone

498
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,641
will begin officially today.

499
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,001
We are in big trouble.

500
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,040
The opening match has begun.

501
00:25:53,481 --> 00:25:54,721
Brother Dai and Ma Hong Jun
are still not awake.

502
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,001
The first fight for the opening match.

503
00:25:58,841 --> 00:25:59,680
The opponents

504
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,761
are the newly joined Shi Lan Ke School

505
00:26:03,241 --> 00:26:03,841
and

506
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,320
the famous

507
00:26:05,841 --> 00:26:07,560
Tian Dou Imperial School's Second Squad.

508
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,881
We don't know if Brother San and Wu

509
00:26:11,881 --> 00:26:12,841
can make it in time.

510
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:16,841
Master.

511
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,560
Gang.

512
00:26:21,961 --> 00:26:22,481
Where is Tang San?

513
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:23,400
And Wu?

514
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,841
Tang San and Wu are still
absorbing Soul Rings.

515
00:26:24,841 --> 00:26:25,920
They can't make it here for now.

516
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,001
You guys will go for the first round.

517
00:26:32,761 --> 00:26:33,721
Us?

518
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,920
Here are the rules for the preliminary.

519
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,320
A one-on-one tag match.

520
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,200
Losers exit the arena while winners stay

521
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:46,280
until all their opponents are defeated.

522
00:26:46,641 --> 00:26:48,241
The last winner will then be determined.

523
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,560
Let's have Shi Lan Ke

524
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,601
and Tian Dou Imperial School's Second Squad

525
00:26:52,961 --> 00:26:53,560
to send out their contestants.

526
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,001
Headmaster.

527
00:26:54,601 --> 00:26:55,121
Let me do it.

528
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,841
I will try to fight all the way through.

529
00:27:02,081 --> 00:27:03,001
I'll go.

530
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,081
Support Branch is strong too.

531
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:07,361
I will help exhaust some of the opponents.

532
00:27:08,241 --> 00:27:10,520
The rest will be on you guys.

533
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,520
I have the responsibility

534
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,920
to uphold the honor of Shi Lan Ke.

535
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,121
He actually looks cool.

536
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,680
Do you two have anything to say?

537
00:28:13,881 --> 00:28:16,481
You... Are you a human or a flower?

538
00:28:16,481 --> 00:28:17,641
Are you a human or a flower?

539
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,841
Isn't that Ou Si Ke's voice?

540
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,241
Why is it so clear?

541
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,601
He's amplifying his voice
through a flower.

542
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,520
That is not an ordinary ability.

543
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,160
I am the host of the contest

544
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,361
and also the referee.

545
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,560
How do we determine the winner?

546
00:28:34,961 --> 00:28:36,560
You lose when you fall off the stage.

547
00:28:36,721 --> 00:28:38,241
You lose when you lose your mind.

548
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,280
You lose when you can't fight back.

549
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,001
What if I killed him

550
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,160
accidentally?

551
00:28:55,241 --> 00:28:57,601
Don't worry. With me here,

552
00:28:57,601 --> 00:28:59,800
it won't happen in the arena.

553
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,361
Do you all understand?

554
00:29:01,761 --> 00:29:03,160
The contest starts now.

555
00:29:03,601 --> 00:29:04,361
It starts already?

556
00:29:15,641 --> 00:29:16,841
Support Branch Soul Master.

557
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:18,920
Yes.

558
00:29:19,121 --> 00:29:20,160
I will let you attack first.

559
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,680
Thank you.

560
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,001
Where's your Martial Soul?

561
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,601
Soon. It's ready soon.

562
00:29:31,761 --> 00:29:32,241
It's almost done.

563
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,280
Rocketing Kiwi!

564
00:29:37,481 --> 00:29:38,280
Are you done?

565
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:45,721
Referee!

566
00:29:45,961 --> 00:29:48,361
Did he sneak off the arena?

567
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,721
He's still within the arena.

568
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,440
Scorpion Tail Sting!

569
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,800
Why isn't there any blood?

570
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,361
Is it an illusion or an ice doll?

571
00:30:13,841 --> 00:30:15,361
He didn't make any sound after falling.

572
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,280
Shi Lan Ke School

573
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,361
wins the first match.

574
00:30:45,081 --> 00:30:46,280
The weapon and items used

575
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,001
are acceptable for Soul Masters.

576
00:30:48,361 --> 00:30:50,320
His flying ability

577
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,721
is his own Soul Skill.

578
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,761
He did not violate any rules.

579
00:30:55,881 --> 00:30:58,121
He used his weapon and items

580
00:30:58,121 --> 00:30:58,841
and won the match.

581
00:30:59,400 --> 00:30:59,800
Not bad.

582
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
He's a capable young man.

583
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,881
How promising.

584
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,400
Let's see if we have the chance

585
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,721
to invite him into our clan

586
00:31:07,841 --> 00:31:08,961
and give him proper training.

587
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,081
I will take over.

588
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,481
I give up.

589
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,241
A student has abstained.

590
00:31:36,721 --> 00:31:38,800
Shi Lan Ke School has one person down.

591
00:31:41,641 --> 00:31:42,320
Well done.

592
00:31:43,081 --> 00:31:44,241
Why is he holding Rong Rong's hand?

593
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,200
She is just supporting him to walk.

594
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,841
That's normal.

595
00:31:47,841 --> 00:31:48,481
He can't!

596
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,160
Rong Rong is looking at him differently.

597
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,841
Her eyes are sparkling.

598
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,881
About him joining our clan...

599
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,200
I oppose!

600
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,361
Ou Si Ke, well done!

601
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:00,841
How did you do that?

602
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,560
My Rocketing Kiwi

603
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,001
can only last for 15 minutes.

604
00:32:04,481 --> 00:32:05,800
So I didn't fall,

605
00:32:06,081 --> 00:32:07,641
I stopped while facing the floor.

606
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,761
I'm not asking that.

607
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:09,881
Of course I knew that.

608
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:10,881
I want to know

609
00:32:11,081 --> 00:32:12,121
how did you trick him

610
00:32:12,121 --> 00:32:13,160
into seeing you as an illusion?

611
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,241
I added an immediate cooling feature

612
00:32:15,241 --> 00:32:16,800
to this staff,

613
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,241
so that it could create a layer of ice
over my body.

614
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,881
Even if I'm wounded,

615
00:32:21,121 --> 00:32:22,040
I wouldn't...

616
00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:23,641
I wouldn't bleed immediately.

617
00:32:24,121 --> 00:32:24,761
It looks like

618
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:26,320
the Ice Puppet
from Ice Branch Martial Soul.

619
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,001
That's right.

620
00:32:27,361 --> 00:32:28,520
It is an item used

621
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,121
to act as
an Ice Branch Martial Soul on stage.

622
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,160
It can turn clouds into rain while cooling.

623
00:32:32,961 --> 00:32:33,800
It's killing two birds with one stone.

624
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:34,680
Yes.

625
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,920
Turning clouds into rain?

626
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,040
What's the use of it?

627
00:32:38,721 --> 00:32:40,081
The opponents are all Triple Soul Rings.

628
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,241
Relying on the electric current
from the staff

629
00:32:42,241 --> 00:32:43,320
might be insufficient to defeat him.

630
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,680
But it's a different story if the body is wet.

631
00:32:46,121 --> 00:32:47,081
What's the difference?

632
00:32:47,761 --> 00:32:49,200
I realized it when I was testing
the electric shock.

633
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,400
When your body is dry

634
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,320
or when it's wet,

635
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,160
the damage inflicted is completely different.

636
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,680
If your body is dry,

637
00:32:54,841 --> 00:32:56,481
your injury will start from your skin.

638
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:57,841
Some even look like a burn injury.

639
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,400
But if it's wet,

640
00:33:00,241 --> 00:33:01,361
your external wound will be reduced.

641
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:02,961
But your internal wound

642
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,920
will be significant.

643
00:33:04,881 --> 00:33:05,721
I didn't know it.

644
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,241
You are quite impressive.

645
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,001
Of course.

646
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:09,841
I realized it...

647
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,121
after being electrocuted so many times.

648
00:33:15,481 --> 00:33:16,920
Are you guys still competing?

649
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,560
Admit defeat if you are scared.

650
00:33:19,961 --> 00:33:21,001
Stop wasting our time.

651
00:33:25,641 --> 00:33:26,481
We can't interfere.

652
00:33:26,961 --> 00:33:28,160
Besides the rules,

653
00:33:28,481 --> 00:33:29,560
even though we can't see the referee,

654
00:33:29,961 --> 00:33:30,761
he is very powerful

655
00:33:31,641 --> 00:33:32,560
in terms of his ability.

656
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,560
Get ready.

657
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,040
The next contestant.

658
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,400
For this round,

659
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:42,680
Rong Rong can be the next.

660
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,241
Okay.

661
00:33:46,121 --> 00:33:48,121
Their Support Branch Soul Masters
can fight too.

662
00:33:48,601 --> 00:33:50,121
What an interesting school.

663
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,520
Tang San seems to be missing.

664
00:33:52,841 --> 00:33:54,920
After Tang San came to Cang Hui,

665
00:33:55,361 --> 00:33:56,680
I haven't paid much attention to him.

666
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,361
Do you know why?

667
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,081
It's because you have him under control.

668
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,481
I'm waiting for today's match.

669
00:34:06,361 --> 00:34:07,160
I would like to know

670
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,680
if Tang San's team

671
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,641
is strong enough to be my pawns.

672
00:34:12,081 --> 00:34:12,841
Investigate

673
00:34:13,641 --> 00:34:15,841
the identity of the new referee.

674
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:16,960
Yes.

675
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,720
Get him

676
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,480
to favor our side.

677
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,960
We'll accept any price he suggests.

678
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,800
What if he refuses?

679
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,361
Threaten him.

680
00:34:28,361 --> 00:34:29,401
How do you plan to do that?

681
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,280
Your Highness.

682
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,320
Give us a moment.

683
00:34:45,361 --> 00:34:48,121
Are you thinking of fighting
the Grand Soul Land Master?

684
00:34:51,161 --> 00:34:51,881
I never thought

685
00:34:52,201 --> 00:34:53,601
that as the Grand Chrysanthemum Master,

686
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,560
you would lower yourself to be the referee.

687
00:34:57,121 --> 00:34:59,520
The chief takes this contest very seriously.

688
00:35:00,081 --> 00:35:00,881
Your Highness,

689
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:03,201
didn't you say you planned to threaten me?

690
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,800
Since it's the Grand Soul Land Master,

691
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:09,201
I would say it's winning you over.

692
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,960
If you want my help in the contest,

693
00:35:13,081 --> 00:35:14,081
it's not impossible.

694
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,441
On what conditions?

695
00:35:17,361 --> 00:35:18,520
I heard that

696
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,641
you are an enemy of Crown Prince Xue Qing He.

697
00:35:20,681 --> 00:35:22,040
We will help you to deal with him

698
00:35:22,841 --> 00:35:24,681
and seize the ruling right of the empire for you.

699
00:35:30,601 --> 00:35:31,480
What then?

700
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,560
I will be the puppet for Martial Soul Hall.

701
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,361
The conflicts in Tian Dou Imperial

702
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,361
don't require Martial Soul Hall
to interfere.
