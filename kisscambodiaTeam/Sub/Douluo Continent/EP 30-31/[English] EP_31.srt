=Episode 31=

14
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,120
The war between the royal families
in Tian Dou Empire

15
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,240
is none of Martial Soul Hall's business.

16
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,080
In this case,

17
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,279
let's watch the match.

18
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:55,560
Next,

19
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,120
Shi Lan Ke School.

20
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:12,080
Jiubao Boosts!

21
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,279
First, Strength! Second, Speed!

22
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,440
Third, Soul! Fourth, Defense!

23
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:20,400
The match hasn't even started.

24
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
I didn't hit you.

25
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,199
Is this allowed?

26
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:28,119
As long as she doesn't hit you,

27
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,839
she can prep however she wants.

28
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,440
Is it time to start now?

29
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,080
Why hasn't the match begun?

30
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,999
The girl's Amber Pagoda

31
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:39,040
doesn't have seven layers.

32
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:40,919
The Martial Soul of Qibao Amber Clan.

33
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,160
If it's not seven layers, how many layers then?

34
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,559
Perhaps the rumor of nine layers is true?

35
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,400
This school is interesting.

36
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,160
The match starts now.

37
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,119
Is that your trump card?

38
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,240
Don't dodge if you can.

39
00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:57,119
What's that?

40
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,759
That should be what Ou Si Ke left behind
from the previous match.

41
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:10,639
I left all the gunpowder

42
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,440
in the arena.

43
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:13,839
It will explode if the temperature is right.

44
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,040
It can stagger

45
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,080
but it won't be powerful enough to kill.

46
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:18,040
If you can't knock him out of the arena,

47
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,960
surrender immediately.

48
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,680
You almost scared me.

49
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:31,879
Surrender, Rong Rong!

50
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,879
Don't hit her!

51
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,720
Rong Rong!

52
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,840
He touched the ground first.

53
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,919
The order doesn't matter.

54
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,000
Both of you are out.

55
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,199
I disagree!

56
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,520
You lost. Just admit defeat.

57
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:08,759
If you hit her again,

58
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,800
your team will be disqualified.

59
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,240
Let's go.

60
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:22,319
They didn't notice us, right?

61
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,359
No, not at all.

62
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,599
That's good.

63
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,520
What are you staring at?

64
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,960
Grandpa Sword and my dad
came to my match.

65
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,879
Where are they?

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,599
Up there.

67
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,000
The two hooded men.

68
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:38,840
You noticed them through the disguise?

69
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,919
They don't want to distract me,

70
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,720
so they covered themselves up.

71
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,759
But their disguise

72
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,159
is so poor.

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,599
After all,

74
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,800
I'm the princess of

75
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,439
Qibao Amber Clan.

76
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,280
I'm smart.

77
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,439
You won.

78
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:57,639
I'll forgive you for your tantrum.

79
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,280
This is cheating.

80
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,080
No, it isn't.

81
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:03,599
This is the trap left by the previous guy.

82
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,720
Let me give you an example, Your Highness.

83
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:07,960
If a hole is left from the previous match

84
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,439
and someone in the next match
fell down

85
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,319
and twisted his ankle,

86
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,520
is this cheating?

87
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,159
This is different.

88
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,439
I don't see a problem here.

89
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,359
I disagree.

90
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,319
Your Highness,

91
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,439
this is a competition
organized by Martial Soul Hall.

92
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,599
If you disagree with the rules,

93
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,879
go organize your own competition.

94
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,359
So this is personal then?

95
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,039
It's a fair competition.

96
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,840
Two Support Branch Soul Masters
can create such a result.

97
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,280
It's impressive.

98
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,960
These two matches

99
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,599
are not about strength

100
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:38,800
but strategy.

101
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,919
But if you have no power,

102
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:44,639
your brain can only do so much.

103
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,639
I hope the next Soul Master

104
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,560
can bring me some excitement.

105
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,080
Or else,

106
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,960
I'll be very disappointed with

107
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,599
Shi Lan Ke's battle team.

108
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,240
Here, Rong Rong.

109
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:00,520
Replenish your stamina.

110
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:04,240
I'm fine.

111
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,159
I told you to surrender.

112
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,240
You took out one opponent.

113
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,319
I didn't want to be the useless one.

114
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,240
Hold on.

115
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:15,159
Stamina is crucial.

116
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,080
Take one.

117
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:17,479
Here, take it.

118
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:20,960
Good luck!

119
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,000
Don't worry.

120
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,639
Sister Qing has Quadruple Soul Rings.

121
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,919
But our opponent is

122
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:26,520
Tian Dou Imperial School's Second Squad.

123
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,439
Don't worry.

124
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,400
I left notes in the house.

125
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,520
Whoever wakes up first

126
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,400
can come over

127
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:33,599
straight away.

128
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:38,120
I hope they can wake up on time.

129
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:00,280
The match starts now!

130
00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:21,639
She fainted.

131
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,239
Tian Dou Imperial School's Second Squad,
one contestant is out.

132
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,639
Start!

133
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,040
Quadruple Soul Rings again?

134
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,679
Zhu Zhu Qing should be able to win.

135
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,639
What?

136
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:55,920
The Support Branch Soul Master just now

137
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,720
worries me.

138
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,319
Zhu Zhu Qing is getting slower.

139
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:05,799
I knew it.

140
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,360
It's the ability
of the Support Branch Soul Masters.

141
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,559
My eyes can't keep up

142
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,520
with your speed.

143
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,679
Let me tell you,

144
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,080
the Soul Skill that the Support Branch

145
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,160
Soul Master used just now

146
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,559
is called Heavy Armour.

147
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,999
It has a simple effect.

148
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,319
The last person who touches her

149
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:50,879
will be protected by the Armour

150
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,199
and will have to shoulder its weight.

151
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,559
But the weight

152
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:57,480
might not affect you much.

153
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:14,119
Heavy Amour might look like

154
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:15,319
a Supportive Soul Skill,

155
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,439
but for me,

156
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:18,920
it has another use.

157
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,160
You can sense my movement.

158
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:24,679
No, I can sense

159
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,239
the Heavy Armour.

160
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:28,960
As long as the Armour is on you,

161
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,439
you can't have any secrets

162
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,559
in front of me.

163
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,639
Surrender.

164
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,840
Nether Slash.

165
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:57,840
Impressive,

166
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,160
but not enough.

167
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,559
The Armour from the Support Branch

168
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:21,759
is sturdy,

169
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,879
but it has a limit, right?

170
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,040
You fought me

171
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,799
so that you can wear the Armour down?

172
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:42,080
Nether Claws.

173
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,840
Fainted.

174
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,799
Tian Dou Imperial School's Second Squad,

175
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:00,400
another one out.

176
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,999
Another Quadruple Soul Rings?

177
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,239
Surrender.

178
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,040
Start!

179
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,360
It's okay. Surrender.

180
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:47,360
Your teacher is right.

181
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,920
You're fast.

182
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:01,119
My Martial Soul is King Kong.

183
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:02,319
I have no Soul Skill.

184
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,040
Usually,

185
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,679
Speed Type Soul Master
is my worst nightmare.

186
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,280
If your legs were not injured,

187
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,520
perhaps I wouldn't be able to win.

188
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:14,439
Why don't you announce the result?

189
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:17,439
This fight is not over yet.

190
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,080
Sister Qing!

191
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:34,920
Stop fighting! Just surrender.

192
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,040
Stop fighting!

193
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,960
You can try,

194
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,920
but you only prolong the inevitable.

195
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,639
Ghost Shadow Doppelganger.

196
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:08,879
Shi Lan Ke School, one contestant out.

197
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:13,999
Shi Lan Ke School,

198
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,199
who's the next one?

199
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:26,439
Brother Dai, you woke up?

200
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:36,840
Ma Hong Jun,

201
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,239
did you see this?

202
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,319
Yes.

203
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:40,280
Then why didn't you go?

204
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:41,280
I'm...

205
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,999
illiterate.

206
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:43,960
Hurry up!

207
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,439
We can make it.

208
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,360
Our rival is
Tian Dou Imperial School's Second Squad.

209
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,360
We might have to fight till late night.

210
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,520
I'll count to three.

211
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,920
If Shi Lan Ke School presents no one,

212
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,080
it'll be disqualified.

213
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:00,879
One.

214
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:05,999
Two.

215
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:21,720
Tang San from Shi Lan Ke School

216
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:22,999
will join.

217
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:27,879
Wu.

218
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:30,160
Start!

219
00:16:58,759 --> 00:16:59,999
Black Soul Ring.

220
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,319
Decade Millennium Soul Ring.

221
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,840
How is it possible?

222
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,960
Are you the last one
from Tian Dou Imperial School's Second Squad?

223
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,720
Your teammates put up a great fight.

224
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:11,880
I'm glad.

225
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,960
I'm worried about their injury.

226
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,840
Guess I'll have to win
as soon as possible.

227
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,480
Intertwine!

228
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:33,360
Constraint of Spider Web.

229
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:37,279
Blue Silver Cage.

230
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:55,360
What happened?

231
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,919
How did I get down here?

232
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,120
The last contestant from
Tian Dou Imperial School's

233
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:03,480
Second Squad is out.

234
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,760
Shi Lan Ke School won

235
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,559
the first round, the first match
of the competition.

236
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,199
Master. Headmaster.

237
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:14,399
How's the injury?

238
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:15,720
You look terribly wounded.

239
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,000
Why aren't you guys speaking?

240
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,880
What happened?

241
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,279
You won just like that?

242
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:22,159
According to the rules,

243
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:23,760
you lose if you're out of the arena.

244
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,159
What?

245
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:24,720
Isn't it?

246
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:26,720
Yes,

247
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,360
I just didn't expect

248
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,799
a swift match.

249
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:30,960
Exactly.

250
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,240
Are you okay?

251
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,399
I'm fine.

252
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,600
I don't understand.

253
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,159
Tang San's Soul Skills

254
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,240
are not that powerful.

255
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:38,919
How can he win so quickly?

256
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,519
Tang San has already found out

257
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,760
his own combat rhythm.

258
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:43,600
It's a piece of cake.

259
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,519
Let's go.

260
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,360
We'll visit Shi Lan Ke at night.

261
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:48,880
This team

262
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,240
has what it takes

263
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,159
to be my pawn.

264
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:53,880
Headmaster.

265
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,720
We made it.

266
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,480
You guys came.

267
00:18:56,399 --> 00:18:56,720
Master.

268
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,000
The match is over. We won.

269
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,439
You won? Hooray!

270
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,559
Why are you so late, Captain?

271
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,039
The match is already over.

272
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,519
How's the wound?

273
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,240
It's fine.

274
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,399
What fine?

275
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,439
Sister Qing has the worst injury.

276
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,640
Especially her legs.

277
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,640
Can you still walk?

278
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:12,840
Yes.

279
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:17,919
I'll bring her back for healing.

280
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,640
Okay, just go.

281
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,039
Put me down!

282
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:22,159
People are watching.

283
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:26,319
Stop gawking.

284
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:27,480
Let's go back.

285
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,880
Yes, let's go.

286
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,399
Brother San.

287
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,120
Let's go.

288
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:32,319
Let me help you, Rong Rong.

289
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,080
This is unusual.

290
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:36,519
What's so unusual?

291
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,960
I think it's normal.

292
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,439
Usually, Brother Dai only cares about

293
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:40,519
the outcome of the match.

294
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,000
He always mulls over

295
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,480
the strategy after each match.

296
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,640
Why is he not

297
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,159
interested

298
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:46,279
in our strategy today?

299
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:47,919
He only cares about Sister Qing.

300
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,519
I didn't expect

301
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,519
that he knows how to take care of a girl.

302
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,159
He only takes care of Sister Qing.

303
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:55,600
But that's odd.

304
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,039
That Brother Dai that I know of

305
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:58,000
is someone

306
00:19:58,559 --> 00:19:59,720
strong and manly.

307
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,640
He would never speak
more than one line

308
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,480
to a girl.

309
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,120
Now he's carrying Sister Qing

310
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,559
with such gentleness and care.

311
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:06,919
Wait.

312
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,199
His Martial Soul mutated.

313
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,720
This is not normal, Brother Dai.

314
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,679
-The Martial Soul advanced and mutated.
-Idiot!

315
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,399
Rong Rong!

316
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:21,120
Your Highness.

317
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,519
Sorry for letting you down.

318
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:25,720
Your Tai tribe

319
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,199
were cornered
by Martial Soul Hall

320
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,279
before I saved you guys.

321
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:32,159
Yes.

322
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,199
My grandpa told me.

323
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:34,360
We will never forget

324
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,199
your help.

325
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,840
Is this how you pay your gratitude then?

326
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,640
I'm willing to accept all punishment.

327
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,279
Don't let Tang San
live to see another day.

328
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,240
Understood?

329
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,039
I will challenge him.

330
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,240
They have a master and a headmaster.

331
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,159
How are you going to challenge him?

332
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,840
Find you grandpa.

333
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:01,120
Ask him to kill Tang San.

334
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,360
I can't.

335
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:05,919
Tell him that

336
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,919
he owes me one.

337
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:09,679
I'll cash in here.

338
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,039
But Your Highness...

339
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,120
Go and tell him now.

340
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:12,799
I...

341
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,199
Yes.

342
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,399
Brother San.

343
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,159
Wu?

344
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:43,319
Come in.

345
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,519
What's up?

346
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,600
Teacher Liu said that

347
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,039
the wounds of Rong Rong and Sister Qing

348
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:52,600
were not serious.

349
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,919
They just need to have a bit of rest.

350
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:54,600
That's good.

351
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,760
I see you hiding in your room

352
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,039
after the match.

353
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:06,600
Is something troubling you?

354
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,000
Do you remember

355
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:12,840
what I told you about the Xuan Tian Records?

356
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:14,960
You told me

357
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,799
that your dad let you learn
different techniques from it.

358
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,159
Wu.

359
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,679
Can you promise

360
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:25,199
not to tell anyone about

361
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:26,519
what I'm going to say next?

362
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:28,880
I promise.

363
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,439
In the domain,

364
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,039
my mum told me that

365
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,720
Xuan Tian Records

366
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,080
might be able to create

367
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:40,799
another kind of power that's different
from Soul Master's.

368
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,519
Different from Soul Master's...

369
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,039
Is it a new way of fighting?

370
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:48,199
Then perhaps

371
00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:49,399
we don't need Martial Soul anymore.

372
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,799
Humans don't have to hunt

373
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:51,519
Soul Beasts down.

374
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:55,559
I don't think so.

375
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,519
Why?

376
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,720
It seems that my Martial Soul

377
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,519
has combined with Xuan Tian Strike.

378
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,399
That man wants to kill Tang San.

379
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
Let them be.

380
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,240
Won't he ruin our plan?

381
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,960
If I'm not mistaken,

382
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:28,760
that man is the leader of Tai tribe.

383
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,199
Another fallen tribe.

384
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,960
The leader of Tai tribe

385
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:35,319
is allegedly a strong one
with Eight Soul Rings.

386
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
More importantly,

387
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,279
he's under Prince Xue Xing's order.

388
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,360
Have Tang San and the others

389
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,480
become the targets of Prince Xue Xing?

390
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,799
Don't meddle.

391
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,240
Don't draw the attention of the royal family.

392
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,799
What if Shi Lan Ke

393
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,760
gets destroyed?

394
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,679
We'll find another pawn

395
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,480
to manipulate.

396
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,519
I'm going back to the school.

397
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,279
You go and visit Venom Soul Master.

398
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:04,519
Du Gu Bo.

399
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,480
He's been poisoned for so long.

400
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,039
We owe him an explanation.

401
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,799
Tell him about my request.

402
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,039
But...

403
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,120
He's a Grand Soul Land Master.

404
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:20,439
Are you afraid of death?

405
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,519
I...

406
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,199
I'll visit Venom Soul Master now.

407
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,319
Don't worry.

408
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:29,799
He's still poisoned.

409
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:31,120
He won't hit you.

410
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:33,600
Go.

411
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,360
Wu,

412
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,360
try tearing it.

413
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,679
Wow.

414
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,519
Is it because of
the decade Millennium Soul Ring?

415
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:57,840
It's because of Xuan Tian Strike.

416
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,480
They are some basic techniques that I learnt

417
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,840
from Xuan Tian Strike.

418
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,319
What does this have

419
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:05,159
to do with Blue Silver Plant?

420
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,279
After the advancement,

421
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,720
I realized that Xuan Tian Strike

422
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,319
could be combined with Soul Power.

423
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,640
And this Blue Silver Plant

424
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:13,240
became more tenacious.

425
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,039
Isn't that good?

426
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:16,519
But this also means that

427
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:18,199
Xuan Tian Strike is a Supportive Soul Skill.

428
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,240
It cannot replace the Martial Soul.

429
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,439
Perhaps my parents

430
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,760
are mistaken?

431
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,720
Perhaps the Xuan Tian Records

432
00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:31,519
is not that miraculous?

433
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,360
Be patient.

434
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,120
Once you become stronger,

435
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:36,439
you might find out

436
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:37,319
other possibilities.

437
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,159
If only I could see my dad now.

438
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:57,120
Let go of her.

439
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,600
Eight Soul Rings. A Great Soul Land Master.

440
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,360
If we fight here,

441
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,279
your teachers and schoolmates
will be affected.

442
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,799
She's just asleep.

443
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,760
I did not hurt her.

444
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,240
Follow me,

445
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:32,159
so I won't hurt anyone else.

446
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,519
You did obey us so nicely.

447
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,240
I don't want others to get hurt

448
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,080
because of me.

449
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,559
Such integrity.

450
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,279
The fact that my grandson lost to you

451
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
is not unacceptable.

452
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,519
So is this a revenge

453
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,559
after you lost to me?

454
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,600
I'm not someone like this.

455
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:09,319
The Tai tribe

456
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,480
owes someone a favour.

457
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,480
We came here

458
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,439
because we were forced to.

459
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:17,240
What did they ask you to do?

460
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,120
To kill you.

461
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:20,120
So just me alone?

462
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:21,840
No one else?

463
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,399
Knowing that a Great Soul Land Master
is going to kill you,

464
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,840
you still remain level-headed.

465
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:29,000
As long as you don't drag others in.

466
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:30,600
So you'll submit to your fate?

467
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,360
Do you think you can win?

468
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,039
You have Eight Soul Rings.
I don't stand a chance.

469
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:42,039
Then why do you fight?

470
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,240
I'd rather die in a battle

471
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,720
than surrender.

472
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:53,039
Fine.

473
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,880
I'll give you a chance.

474
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,439
If you can get past me

475
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,919
and enter the door,

476
00:27:58,679 --> 00:27:59,439
consider yourself safe.

477
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,480
I'll leave.

478
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:03,679
What if I can't?

479
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,720
I'll kill you.

480
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,519
Okay.

481
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:08,640
Bring it on.

482
00:28:23,439 --> 00:28:24,039
Kiddo.

483
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,559
Your Blue Silver Plant is tenacious.

484
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:32,840
What is this Soul Skill?

485
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,319
The Martial Souls of our tribe

486
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,640
have no Soul Skill.

487
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,880
What's that then?

488
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,600
Harnessing strength to its fullest.

489
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,240
I can create an updraft
just by snapping my finger.

490
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,159
It can be used to hurt someone.

491
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:50,600
Blue Silver Cage.

492
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:31,840
Hao Tian Hammer.

493
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,840
What's Hao Tian Hammer?

494
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,240
My Martial Soul is Blue Silver Plant.

495
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,360
What's your name?

496
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,720
His name is Tang San, grandpa.

497
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,360
Is your surname Tang?

498
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,600
What's your father's name?

499
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,240
Tang San, it's me.

500
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,480
Your Blue Silver Plant is stronger now.

501
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,840
Let's test

502
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,760
its Soul Power data.

503
00:29:56,679 --> 00:29:57,199
Tang San.

504
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,640
Wu.

505
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:07,000
You said your dad was a blacksmith?

506
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,360
Yes.

507
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,240
What kind of blacksmith?

508
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:08,919
Other than a normal blacksmith,

509
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:09,559
what else could a blacksmith be?

510
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,279
How is he a blacksmith?

511
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,360
What's your father's name?

512
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:18,399
Why should I tell you?

513
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,559
Tell me

514
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,919
and I'll let you in.

515
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,799
Such power.

516
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,559
Spill it!

517
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,919
What's your father's name?

518
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,480
Sir, if you have any problem,
you can come to me.

519
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,640
No need to trouble the youth.

520
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,720
Spill it!

521
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:45,600
I won't.

522
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:49,960
Titan?

523
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:52,360
Who are you?

524
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:56,279
Lander, Er Long.

525
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,240
Go back first.

526
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,880
Trust me, Tang San will be fine.

527
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,080
Tang San.

528
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,799
Your father's name.

529
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:12,240
You can tell him.

530
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:15,279
My dad is Tang Hao.

531
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:19,840
Grandpa!

532
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,840
Grandpa, are you all right?

533
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:26,960
I entered,

534
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,519
so you lost.

535
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,640
What are you doing?

536
00:31:32,439 --> 00:31:34,559
So that's why you have Hao Tian Hammer

537
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,919
and Blue Silver Plant.

538
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,600
You have Twin Martial Souls.

539
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,720
What's Hao Tian Hammer?

540
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,439
My Martial Soul is Blue Silver Plant.

541
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:45,399
Young Master!

542
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:47,360
Wait.

543
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:47,600
Grandpa.

544
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:47,960
Wait.

545
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,439
I've finally found you, Young Master.

546
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,480
Stand up first.

547
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,360
Okay. Okay.

548
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,880
I'll stand up.

549
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,640
Calm down, Young Master.

550
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,439
You should calm down instead.

551
00:31:59,120 --> 00:31:59,720
Actually,

552
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:02,760
Master Tang Hao is my master.

553
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,039
M... master?

554
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,840
I'll tell you everything.

555
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,199
Elder?

556
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,399
He's a sore loser.

557
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:20,360
That's why he came for revenge, right?

558
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,679
Look how timely my arrival was.

559
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,159
I stopped everything on time.

560
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:27,760
No, it's...

561
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:34,319
You want me to wake them up?

562
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:36,720
Aren't they our enemies?

563
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:39,319
Yes, enemies.

564
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,120
They even

565
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,279
put me to sleep.

566
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:41,919
See?

567
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,679
Elder, hear me out.

568
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,600
They were our enemies at first,

569
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:48,600
but then

570
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,720
they knelt down in front of me.

571
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,679
Did they hit you on the head?

572
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,840
Elder, they did kneel down before me.

573
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,799
Elder, I'm the eye-witness.

574
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:01,039
Both of them

575
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,319
are not our enemies.

576
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,199
Your public relation is so complicated.

577
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,519
Let's save him first.

578
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:12,799
All right.

579
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,199
The poison is so powerful.

580
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:33,960
Run for your life, Young Master!

581
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:35,880
We're all friends here. Don't fight.

582
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:40,640
So you were saying...?

583
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:43,600
It would be better

584
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,159
if we speak in private.

585
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:49,000
All right. I'll get out.

586
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,720
Elder, rest in my room, please.

587
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,360
Sure.

588
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,880
I'll wait for you outside.

589
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:55,360
I have something for you.

590
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:57,000
Slowly, Elder.

591
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,480
What is happening?

592
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:02,720
Okay.

593
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:03,919
Now you can speak.

594
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,399
Do I have to go out too?

595
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:10,319
I won't keep anything

596
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,480
from Wu.

597
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,200
So she's Young Master's wife.

598
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:16,279
No, no.

599
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,519
She's my sister.

600
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,200
What?

601
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,840
Master Tang has a son and a daughter?

602
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:24,319
Not blood-related.

603
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,039
Continue, please.

604
00:34:29,799 --> 00:34:30,440
Back then,

605
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:32,759
my bad temper

606
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,319
caused huge trouble.

607
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,519
I provoked someone I shouldn't have.

608
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:41,999
The Tai tribe was almost wiped out.

609
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,120
If Master Tang hadn't intervened,

610
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:48,680
my tribe

611
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,719
would have long disappeared.

612
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,319
My life belongs to Master Tang.

613
00:34:56,799 --> 00:34:57,479
Then do you know

614
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:58,880
what happened between him
and Martial Soul Hall back then?

615
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:06,759
Why are you kneeling again?

616
00:35:06,759 --> 00:35:06,999
Grandpa.

617
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:08,319
Here.

618
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:09,519
Sit down.

619
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,999
Young Master.

620
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,239
This is something

621
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:26,080
that I can never let go of.

622
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,400
I failed Master Tang

623
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,600
when he was hunted down
by Martial Soul Hall.

624
00:35:36,319 --> 00:35:38,479
Did you take part in the siege?

625
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,559
Of course not!

626
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:42,959
If I did that,

627
00:35:43,799 --> 00:35:45,640
then I'd be no different than a lowly swine!

628
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,279
Then what do you mean by failed?
