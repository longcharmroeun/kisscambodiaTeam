14
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,279
Could it be done
by the Grand Chrysanthemum Master?

15
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,159
He wants to kill Bi Bi Dong.

16
00:01:48,919 --> 00:01:50,159
Why did he capture people
from the schools that had been out?

17
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,799
Maybe he wanted to frame Bi Bi Dong?

18
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:53,799
That's possible.

19
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,239
Too bad it's only a speculation.

20
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:55,919
We can't prove that.

21
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,080
If we capture him,

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,599
then we'll know the truth.

23
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:00,120
You want to capture
a Grand Soul Land Master?

24
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,400
Do you think it's possible?

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,760
Of course we can't.

26
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:04,440
Not even with Headmaster and the others.

27
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:05,799
Who's the strongest

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,919
in Martial Soul City?

29
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:09,839
Bi Bi Dong?

30
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:11,640
You mean

31
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,320
you want to use Martial Soul Hall to capture him?

32
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,480
That's the only way.

33
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,560
Have you thought clearly about it?

34
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,159
Chi Huo School,

35
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,200
Yu Tian Heng, Du Gu Yan,

36
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,320
and your brother

37
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:23,439
have all gone missing.

38
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,480
Whether Bi Bi Dong
or the Grand Chrysanthemum Master is the bad guy,

39
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,560
I don't care.

40
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,799
I just want to save people.

41
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,879
Cang Hui is working
with the Grand Chrysanthemum Master?

42
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:40,480
Do you think I will believe it?

43
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,560
Didn't Martial Soul Hall

44
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,840
lose an officer?

45
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:43,840
So what?

46
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,719
He was the one

47
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,960
who brought me into the hall.

48
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,799
Also,

49
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,799
he hid an arrow

50
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,400
in the Soul Bone that would serve as the prize.

51
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:54,280
Arrow?

52
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,239
For what?

53
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,359
I'm not sure.

54
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,400
Fine.

55
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,200
Even if Cang Hui is plotting something,

56
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:04,760
that doesn't prove

57
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,320
the Grand Chrysanthemum Master a traitor.

58
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:08,799
Let me ask you,

59
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,680
how many Grand Soul Land Masters

60
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,320
are left in Martial Soul City?

61
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,960
Due to the Soul Beasts in the Star Forest,

62
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,200
they're all on the way there now.

63
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:16,999
That means,

64
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,480
in Martial Soul City,

65
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,400
there's only
the Grand Chrysanthemum Master left.

66
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,519
So?

67
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:25,599
All the schools that had been out disappeared.

68
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:27,239
Beside the Grand Soul Land Master,

69
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,040
who else is capable to do that?

70
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,960
But why did he do that?

71
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,680
Just ask your chief to capture him.

72
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,439
Then you'll know the reason.

73
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,200
Just with what you said,

74
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:43,239
do you really think the chief

75
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,040
will capture her own Grand Soul Land Master?

76
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,760
What if it's false?

77
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:47,639
What will happen?

78
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,079
What if it's true?

79
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,639
You can tell what we said

80
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,480
to your chief,

81
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,920
and let her decide.

82
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,519
I need to verify it first.

83
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,920
Are you going to ask him directly?

84
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,760
Stay here.

85
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:06,920
Where are you going?

86
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,159
I'll be back soon.

87
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
I feel like

88
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,280
she believes you.

89
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:33,039
That's all you've got?

90
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:34,840
Seriously,

91
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,680
I don't think you deserve

92
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,519
to be part of Martial Soul Hall's Battle Team.

93
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:39,799
From the beginning,

94
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:41,319
Martial Soul Hall's Battle Team

95
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,160
only needs me alone.

96
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,039
People like you

97
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:47,000
are just provisional.

98
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:03,000
You disappointed me! Again!

99
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,120
If he finds the chance,

100
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:08,160
he'll surely kill you.

101
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:12,120
Can he?

102
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,000
Alright, calm down.

103
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,479
I'm training my member.

104
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,600
I need him.

105
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,560
Only the strongest Soul Masters

106
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,840
can stay in Martial Soul Hall.

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm helping him.

108
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,239
I want to ask you a favor,

109
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,799
but I can't tell you the reason.

110
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:48,919
Just say it.

111
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:01,160
I think she might not believe us.

112
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,639
Don't you worry?

113
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,000
For what?

114
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,120
What if she leads her people here

115
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,239
and captures us?

116
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:10,720
Why?

117
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,079
Perhaps

118
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,239
she's also working
for the Grand Chrysanthemum Master.

119
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,160
I don't think so.

120
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:16,759
Why not?

121
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,919
Because I feel

122
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:21,199
she really likes the chief
of Martial Soul Hall.

123
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:22,919
How do you know?

124
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,799
Every time when she

125
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,319
mentioned Bi Bi Dong,

126
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,519
it felt to be different.

127
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,359
You just believe her

128
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,960
because of your instinct?

129
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,799
A liar can speak

130
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:34,960
a thousand words,

131
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,759
but they can't hide the feelings.

132
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,560
Tang San.

133
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:41,960
Do you believe Hu Lie Na?

134
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,079
I believe Wu.

135
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,799
If your instinct is so good,

136
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,960
why don't you use it

137
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:54,919
to detect

138
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:56,319
if the Grand Chrysanthemum Master is a spy?

139
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,079
It takes time to tell.

140
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,600
Where have you been just now?

141
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,479
I told Yan

142
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:04,840
to distract the Grand Chrysanthemum Master,

143
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,600
so that we can

144
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,680
check his room out.

145
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:08,639
Yan?

146
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,519
The person using flame on your team?

147
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,120
He's not in a good mental state,

148
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,759
so his flame might get out of control.

149
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,000
The Grand Chrysanthemum Master helps him

150
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,079
to solve it every time.

151
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,479
What if this fire guy

152
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,840
is an accomplice
of the Grand Chrysanthemum Master?

153
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,400
It's meaningless to think of those things.

154
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:23,280
She's right.

155
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,799
The Grand Chrysanthemum Master

156
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:28,799
should be on his way now.

157
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:29,919
Let's hurry up.

158
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,039
What are you trying to get in his room?

159
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,319
Evidence of him betraying the chief.

160
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,840
You think it's so easy to find?

161
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,720
We'll see.

162
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:41,199
Let's go.

163
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,560
This is where he lives?

164
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,039
The Grand Chrysanthemum Master once said

165
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,680
that when one reached maximum power,

166
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:53,519
one would want simpler things.

167
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:55,359
This is considered good.

168
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,160
The Grand Ghost Master
doesn't even have a room.

169
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,560
He stays in the basement.

170
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,319
With no guard?

171
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,280
The Grand Soul Land Master doesn't need guards.

172
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,759
Actually,

173
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,039
I've never entered the room.

174
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,400
There are still chrysanthemums in this season?

175
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:28,440
Even if the Grand Chrysanthemum Master
has secrets,

176
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,639
it's impossible that he just hides them

177
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,479
in his room.

178
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,000
What's wrong?

179
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,000
This is the group division plan for the final.

180
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,639
Anything weird?

181
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,840
It has been altered.

182
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,319
These flowers are quite beautiful.

183
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,999
Yes, they are.

184
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,759
There's something wrong with it.

185
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,119
I can see that too.

186
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,360
Tang San, come over here.

187
00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:03,519
Where is this?

188
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,360
Weren't we

189
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
in the Grand Chrysanthemum Master's room
just now?

190
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,920
I remember I touched the petals,

191
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,199
and then we are here.

192
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:21,920
We can't leave anymore.

193
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,519
Just now they were still here.

194
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:31,999
It's strange.

195
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,240
Are there any traps

196
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,199
in Martial Soul Hall?

197
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:35,999
This is the room of a Grand Soul Land Master.

198
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,119
Who would dare to set a trap here?

199
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,679
Then...

200
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:40,079
Don't look at me this way.

201
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,920
This is obviously
the Grand Chrysanthemum Master's trick.

202
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,960
What does it have to do with me?

203
00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:44,119
Let's ask him then.

204
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,600
Are you crazy?

205
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:48,360
Then what about Tang San and Wu?

206
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,679
I'll look for the chief.

207
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,840
Will she believe us?

208
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:56,720
Let me try.

209
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,519
I'll come with you.

210
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:02,679
Why it isn't working?

211
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,999
Didn't we touch it and get here just now?

212
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,360
Are the entrance and exit of the interspace

213
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,280
separated?

214
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,720
Are these gates the exit?

215
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:22,559
It looks more like a prison.

216
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:26,040
It's locked?

217
00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:31,800
What?

218
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,079
Tang San

219
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,920
disappeared
in the Grand Chrysanthemum Master's room?

220
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:35,920
Not only that,

221
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,319
Tang San also suspected

222
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:38,639
the Grand Chrysanthemum Master
is working with Cang Hui School

223
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,480
to assassinate you.

224
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,519
Hilarious.

225
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,999
We found the group division plan for the contest

226
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:43,480
in the Grand Chrysanthemum Master's room.

227
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:44,999
The plan shows

228
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,360
that Cang Hui's position

229
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:47,360
has been changed.

230
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,800
Previously,

231
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,240
Cang Hui was in Group B with Martial Soul Hall.

232
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,199
That means,

233
00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:52,639
they should encounter

234
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,920
Martial Soul Hall's Battle Team
in the divisional battle.

235
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,079
But the Grand Chrysanthemum Master changed

236
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,920
them to Group A,

237
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,720
and put Tian Dou Imperial in Group B.

238
00:10:59,319 --> 00:10:59,879
Then we would encounter

239
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,160
Tian Dou Imperial earlier.

240
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,679
So what?

241
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,679
That means,

242
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,160
the Grand Chrysanthemum Master
is misusing his authority

243
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,360
to help Cang Hui.

244
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,119
His objective

245
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,999
is to let Cang Hui enter the final.

246
00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:10,600
Just by changing a battle team,

247
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:12,559
he'll be able to kill me?

248
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:13,720
No matter what,

249
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,960
Chief, you should

250
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,920
ask the Grand Chrysanthemum Master.

251
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,559
Enough.

252
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,759
The royal family of Xing Luo

253
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,280
even wants

254
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,600
to interfere with matters of Martial Soul Hall?

255
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,600
That's not it.

256
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,439
I just wish to find Tang San.

257
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:30,559
Do you know how vast is Douluo Continent?

258
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,240
As the greatest Sect in Douluo Continent,

259
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,119
Martial Soul Hall

260
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:39,119
needs to handle countless matters every day.

261
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,679
I don't have time

262
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,480
to listen to your childish speculations!

263
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,800
Go.

264
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,480
I have something to tell the chief.

265
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,079
Please leave.

266
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,920
What do you want to tell me?

267
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,639
I've stayed in Shi Lan Ke School

268
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:10,480
for some time.

269
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,679
I know Tang San very well.

270
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:14,360
He's not someone who talks nonsense.

271
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,999
He said only the Grand Soul Land Master

272
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,840
could make

273
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:18,720
the schools that had been out disappear.

274
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,400
You believe everything he said?

275
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,559
I only feel

276
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,639
that you should

277
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,119
talk to the Grand Chrysanthemum Master.

278
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
Focus on the contest.

279
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,519
You shouldn't be involved

280
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,079
in these matters.

281
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,920
You've never believed

282
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,040
in my capability.

283
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,600
Do you think you're very strong?

284
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,519
Back then,

285
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:45,480
I suggested using your spider pendant

286
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,160
to go to Xing Luo and replace Dai Mu Bai.

287
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,879
My plan was so thorough,

288
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,639
but what have you done?

289
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,999
You've just ignored it.

290
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
So, you

291
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,800
made your own decision
to leave Martial Soul Hall

292
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:58,920
and go to Tian Dou Empire.

293
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,280
In order to ensure your safety,

294
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,879
I had to send Su Yun Tao

295
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:02,999
to go with you.

296
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,319
Ensure my safety?

297
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,679
Or it was just to spy on me?

298
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,879
After Su Yun Tao died,

299
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:09,999
didn't you also send out Yan?

300
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,439
No matter what happened in the process,

301
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,879
the result proved

302
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,920
that I was successful.

303
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:20,920
It was a big success.

304
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,999
I controlled Xue Qing He.

305
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,960
Even the whole Tian Dou

306
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,160
is under our control now.

307
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,400
I have done these things

308
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,480
just to tell you

309
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,160
I can help Martial Soul Hall,

310
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,439
and I can help you!

311
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,199
Do you really think

312
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,400
you were able to fake Xue Qing He?

313
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,679
I've done it.

314
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,800
I've already imprisoned Xue Qing He

315
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,400
and Prince Xue Xing.

316
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:42,600
The whole Tian Dou City

317
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,360
has changed because of me.

318
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:46,999
And then?

319
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,639
After the contest?

320
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,480
You will go back to Tian Dou

321
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,559
as Xue Qing He?

322
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:55,840
Why not?

323
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,879
Do you really think

324
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,319
you can deceive everyone?

325
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:03,240
Your mission now

326
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,879
is to help Martial Soul Hall's Battle Team

327
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,280
to be the champion in the final.

328
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,360
As for the rest,

329
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
you shouldn't bother with them.

330
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,280
In your eyes,

331
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,960
I'm always just a pawn.

332
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:21,920
A puppet that can't have
its own thoughts.

333
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:23,879
Tell me.

334
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,960
Tell me, what should I do

335
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,240
to gain trust from you?

336
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:29,439
Mother!

337
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:30,160
I've said

338
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,999
that you have to hide your identity!

339
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,280
Call me master.

340
00:14:43,439 --> 00:14:44,079
Why?

341
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,600
Why can't I say

342
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,079
I'm your daughter, Qian Ren Xue?

343
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,519
Why do I have to pretend to be Hu Lie Na

344
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,999
and be a disciple of the chief?

345
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:54,960
It's Martial Soul Hall

346
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
and you're the chief.

347
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:58,319
What danger can I get into?

348
00:14:58,319 --> 00:14:59,319
You may leave!

349
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,759
I still think

350
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:18,199
you should talk
to the Grand Chrysanthemum Master.

351
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,079
I'll leave now.

352
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,600
How was it?

353
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,800
She didn't believe me.

354
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:48,879
What?

355
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
But she's your master.

356
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,119
Then what about Tang San?

357
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,199
I'll prove my capability.

358
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,800
How?

359
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,160
Go back
to the Grand Chrysanthemum Master's place first.

360
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:00,960
And then?

361
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:03,519
And we will

362
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,920
capture the Grand Chrysanthemum Master
ourselves.

363
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:20,600
Why do these bodies

364
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,199
look like humans?

365
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,319
They are Soul Beasts.

366
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:32,840
I don't understand.

367
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,960
Wouldn't all Soul Beasts vanish in light dots

368
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,040
after their Soul Rings were absorbed?

369
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,079
Why these bodies can still remain?

370
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,519
Do you know?

371
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,960
A Century Millennium Soul Beast

372
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,280
will turn into a human shape.

373
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,079
You mean all these?

374
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,800
These were close to that.

375
00:16:57,439 --> 00:16:58,119
So,

376
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,519
they started to change.

377
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,799
Soul Beasts that had lived so long

378
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:19,679
were killed and abandoned here.

379
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,960
Were they used in experiments?

380
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:24,279
It means that the one who killed them

381
00:17:25,159 --> 00:17:26,559
didn't absorb their Soul Rings,

382
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,240
but tried to seal the power

383
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,199
back into their bodies again.

384
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:34,919
That's too cruel.

385
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:47,240
I thought

386
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,760
when Soul Beasts turned into humans,

387
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,720
they could live peacefully with the humans.

388
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:01,799
But the result is like this.

389
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,640
I've been considering a question.

390
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,120
Why was Azure Bull Python

391
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,640
from the Star Forest

392
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,279
willing to cooperate with humans

393
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,760
against Martial Soul Hall?

394
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:13,439
Maybe this is the answer.

395
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:14,799
Maybe.

396
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,880
If Da Ming...

397
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,399
I mean, if Azure Bull Python

398
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:23,799
knows that Martial Soul Hall

399
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:25,360
has been slaughtering Soul Beasts,

400
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,520
it'll be very angry.

401
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:32,760
So the Grand Chrysanthemum Master
maltreated Soul Beasts

402
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,159
and framed the chief of Martial Soul Hall.

403
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,279
That made Azure Bull Python angry.

404
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:40,679
Wu,

405
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,840
we'd better leave now.

406
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:43,600
I'm afraid the Grand Chrysanthemum Master
may come back and see us.

407
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:49,600
Brother San.

408
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,000
You think,

409
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,199
if a Century Millennium Soul Beast

410
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:59,240
turns into a human shape,

411
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,120
is it really a human?

412
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,000
My dad has told me

413
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,640
that when the day comes,

414
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,960
they are no different from humans anymore.

415
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,600
Actually, I think

416
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,199
Soul Beasts that have become humans

417
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:11,720
had a tougher life than we think.

418
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,240
Because before transforming,

419
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,360
they had to avoid being killed by Soul Masters.

420
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,360
After transforming into humans,

421
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,600
they had no choice

422
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,799
but to leave their native environment

423
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,799
and train all over again
in the society of Soul Masters.

424
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,880
Grand Chrysanthemum Master.

425
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,120
What's wrong?

426
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,760
He's back.

427
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:44,240
What do we do now?

428
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
He might find Tang San.

429
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:46,799
This is bad.

430
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:48,120
We need to stop him.

431
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:49,600
Let me try.

432
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,520
Can you do it?

433
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,760
I don't talk to him often,

434
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:55,439
and I don't have a good reason
to stop him.

435
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,439
How about this?

436
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:03,760
I'll distract him,

437
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,360
and you go in to look for Tang San and Wu.

438
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,640
What will you do?

439
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:07,960
Just let me try.

440
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:17,840
Why are you here in Martial Soul Hall?

441
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:19,720
I'm purposely here to look for you.

442
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,120
Look for me?

443
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:23,319
Actually, I've been thinking

444
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:24,240
about what you told me.

445
00:20:26,199 --> 00:20:27,399
Didn't you want to take me
as your pupil?

446
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,199
You changed your mind?

447
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,640
Can we talk at another place?

448
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,439
This is where I live.

449
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,319
Follow me.

450
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,880
We'd better not talk in Martial Soul Hall.

451
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,079
I still think that the exit

452
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,240
is related to this flower.

453
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:59,880
This interspace doesn't look like a trap,

454
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,159
but more like
the Grand Chrysanthemum Master's secret chamber.

455
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,960
I don't understand.

456
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,559
Why did we

457
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,480
get in so easily?

458
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:10,600
How should we leave now?

459
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,919
What did we do

460
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:14,840
in his room just now?

461
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:18,679
We didn't do anything.

462
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:20,600
I just touched the petals.

463
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:22,720
Why there's no response now?

464
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,159
Wu?

465
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,000
Wu?

466
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:36,880
Where have you been?

467
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:37,520
Where's Tang San?

468
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:39,000
I came back?

469
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:40,520
Why didn't Tang San come out?

470
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:42,439
From where?

471
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:45,439
Wait.

472
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,319
This flower should be

473
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:47,319
the entrance and exit of the interspace.

474
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:48,720
Flower.

475
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,159
What's going on?

476
00:21:58,319 --> 00:21:58,880
You were right.

477
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:00,159
The flower is the entrance and exit
of the interspace.

478
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,240
I tried, but it didn't work.

479
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:05,000
But didn't we enter just now?

480
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,640
Just now?

481
00:22:11,399 --> 00:22:12,240
These flowers are quite beautiful.

482
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,720
Yes, they are.

483
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,319
You brought me in.

484
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:30,880
Tang San?

485
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:32,679
What's going on?

486
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,960
Interspace.

487
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:36,000
Wu can enter it.

488
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,559
What's inside?

489
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,199
Bodies of Soul Beasts.

490
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:43,880
It's impossible that a Soul Beast
can leave a dead body behind.

491
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,660
Bring me in.

492
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,399
We've walked for quite some time.

493
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,960
What do you want to say?

494
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:04,559
I don't want to be your pupil.

495
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,480
One, because of Shi Lan Ke Battle Team.

496
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,679
Two, because of Martial Soul Hall.

497
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,679
Martial Soul Hall?

498
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:11,600
Yes.

499
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:14,039
Martial Soul Hall is trying
to manipulate the others

500
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,039
with their strong influence. It's annoying.

501
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:17,679
So?

502
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,679
So,

503
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,279
have you thought
about leaving Martial Soul Hall?

504
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,360
Where should I go?

505
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,679
You're a Grand Soul Land Master.

506
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,120
You are welcome everywhere.

507
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,880
Is this a message
from the royal family of Xing Luo?

508
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:28,679
No.

509
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,760
It's my personal view.

510
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,600
Everyone knows

511
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,439
the chief of Martial Soul Hall
is the strongest in the world.

512
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:35,399
Even though you're a Grand Soul Land Master,

513
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,399
you'll never be like the chief.

514
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,960
Why not try to change?

515
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,439
Even though we're in Shi Lan Ke's house now,

516
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:45,120
don't forget

517
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,039
we're still in Martial Soul City.

518
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,520
You're quite bold

519
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:49,279
to say something like this.

520
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,600
You haven't had this kind of idea before?

521
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,960
Don't say these things to anyone else.

522
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,199
I know.

523
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,880
Focus on the contest.

524
00:23:58,199 --> 00:24:00,799
I hope you can enter the final.

525
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,439
I'll go now.

526
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,640
How about I walk you back?

527
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,480
No need.

528
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,199
It's been a long talk.

529
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:07,919
Do you want

530
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:08,919
some new tea from the royal family of Xing Luo?

531
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,679
To soothe your throat.

532
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:16,880
Teleport?

533
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,039
Now we can basically confirm

534
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:49,079
there's something wrong
with the Grand Chrysanthemum Master.

535
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,199
Can you tell

536
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:52,319
your chief about it now?

537
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:53,480
No.

538
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,600
I need to think of a way to capture him.

539
00:24:56,399 --> 00:24:57,039
Why?

540
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:01,039
The chief trusts
the Grand Chrysanthemum Master a lot.

541
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,360
I'm going to use my way

542
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,520
to prove that I am right.

543
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,120
I have some friends in Martial Soul Hall too.

544
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:08,319
Maybe we can try to ambush

545
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:09,120
and capture the Grand Chrysanthemum Master.

546
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:10,640
So,

547
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,880
they are also Grand Soul Land Masters?

548
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,720
The Grand Soul Land Masters
all went to the Star Forest.

549
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:16,960
It seems

550
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:19,000
he caused the Soul Beasts to come out.

551
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,799
But Master also said

552
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:22,640
only a Grand Soul Land Master

553
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:23,799
can contend with another Grand Soul Land Master.

554
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,319
But there's none.

555
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,199
Then tell me

556
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,120
about the Grand Chrysanthemum Master's
schedule tomorrow.

557
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:32,159
What are you trying to do?

558
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:33,799
Tell me first.

559
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,960
The contest covers these two days.

560
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,720
The Grand Chrysanthemum Master is the referee.

561
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,159
It is even Cang Hui's turn tomorrow.

562
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:42,919
After the contest ends?

563
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,520
He'll go back to Martial Soul Hall.

564
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:47,000
Anyone guarding him?

565
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,919
He's a Grand Soul Land Master.

566
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,240
He doesn't need protection.

567
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:53,279
Tell me which way he will take

568
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:53,760
to get back to Martial Soul Hall.

569
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,799
You wish to block him on the way?

570
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:00,679
Yes.

571
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:02,919
You just said

572
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,279
only a Grand Soul Land Master

573
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:05,319
can contend with him.

574
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:07,520
Are you still hiding

575
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,399
something from me?

576
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,960
You don't need to know.

577
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:11,880
Just tell me which way he will take tomorrow

578
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,799
to go back.

579
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,840
Don't you want to stop him

580
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,120
from assassinating your chief?

581
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:19,520
You won't succeed.

582
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,240
Let me try.

583
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,799
I'll tell you the route.

584
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,360
Brother Dai.

585
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:41,039
Where have you been?

586
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,039
I'll tell you on the way.

587
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:42,919
Where are we going?

588
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,000
To see Senior Du Gu.

589
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,520
We'll capture
the Grand Chrysanthemum Master tomorrow.

590
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,600
A battle
between Grand Soul Land Masters?

591
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:47,600
Where should we look for them?

592
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,600
I've talked to them.

593
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,159
We will leave a sign in the city tomorrow night.

594
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,199
Senior Du Gu will come and look for us.

595
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,360
Brother Dai.

596
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,000
Please don't tell

597
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,439
Ou Si Ke,

598
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,240
Headmaster, and the others.

599
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,240
Got it.

600
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,279
Even if something goes wrong,

601
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,480
it has nothing to do with the school.

602
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,159
I'll go first.

603
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,600
Little Venom Freak.

604
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,880
What do you want from me?

605
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:31,559
Senior.

606
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:32,640
Here, have a seat.

607
00:27:33,199 --> 00:27:33,799
Senior.

608
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:35,159
Have you heard
of the Grand Chrysanthemum Master?

609
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,319
Grand Soul Land Master of Martial Soul Hall.

610
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:40,480
What's wrong?

611
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:42,439
If Chief Ning, you,

612
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,720
and the Grand Sword Master join hands,

613
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,120
can you guys capture him alive?

614
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,120
You are planning something big?

615
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:48,640
Listen to me first.

616
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,319
This person is likely to be

617
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:52,640
the spy working for Cang Hui
in Martial Soul Hall.

618
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,120
If we capture him,

619
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,159
we'll know where Hao Tian Soul Master is.

620
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,000
If the three of us join hands
and take him by surprise,

621
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:01,960
I think we should be able to capture him.

622
00:28:02,439 --> 00:28:04,120
Then let's go through the details.

623
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:05,199
Hold on.

624
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:06,600
Tell me first.

625
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,720
How do you know he is the spy?

626
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,520
I was brought into Martial Soul Hall,

627
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:13,799
and I saw the prize for the contest.

628
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,439
And the arrow

629
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,000
merged into the Soul Bone.

630
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:19,079
Good.

631
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,240
Also,

632
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:22,720
the person who brought me
into the hall

633
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:24,840
committed suicide.

634
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:28,159
Of course he should die,

635
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,399
or it'll cause trouble.

636
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,199
You are different.

637
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:33,960
When it's done,

638
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,079
I'll ensure your safety.

639
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,880
Thank you, Teacher.

640
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,120
After winning tomorrow's battle,

641
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,360
we have one opponent left in Group A.

642
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,360
Shi Lan Ke School?

643
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,520
Defeat Shi Lan Ke School,

644
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,000
and you will enter the final.

645
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,880
I've watched
Martial Soul Hall's Battle Team's matches.

646
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:54,600
Even if we enter the final,

647
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,000
I'm afraid we can't win.

648
00:28:58,799 --> 00:28:59,840
You don't have to worry about that.

649
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,199
There shouldn't be any problem
with tomorrow's battle.

650
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,439
The only trouble

651
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,439
is Shi Lan Ke School.

652
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,000
I've helped Shi Lan Ke so much.

653
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,919
It's time to end it.

654
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:21,000
What should I do?

655
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,360
Just focus on the contest.

656
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:29,079
I'll handle the rest.

657
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,360
Alright.

658
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:35,319
After hearing what you've said,

659
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,399
you might be right.

660
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,279
We need to capture
the Grand Chrysanthemum Master

661
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,159
in order to get the answer.

662
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,480
So, what's your relationship
with Martial Soul Hall?

663
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,439
None.

664
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,319
Then why do you want to stop him

665
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:50,559
from assassinating the chief?

666
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:53,679
One, for what Cang Hui did.

667
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I've borrowed some special medicine

668
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,039
that might cause the mutation of Martial Soul.

669
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,799
It seems like he was poisoned.

670
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,600
Hold it.

671
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,039
Shi Nian made them like this.

672
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,079
Shi Nian's Martial Soul is Broken Dream.

673
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:13,960
It can cause hallucinations

674
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:15,279
that are inescapable.

675
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:17,360
They created Mutant Souls

676
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:19,600
and poisoned you and Du Gu Yan.

677
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,360
They even used spirit control

678
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,760
on their own students.

679
00:30:24,439 --> 00:30:25,039
I don't care

680
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,279
if he's going to kill the chief
of Martial Soul Hall.

681
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:28,600
I just think

682
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,000
if an evil person like him

683
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,880
gains power one day,

684
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:33,439
it might be a scarier catastrophe

685
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,480
for Douluo Continent.

686
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:36,600
What else?

687
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,880
There's another reason.

688
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:42,799
Promise me

689
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,159
that you'll stay calm when you hear it.

690
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:48,559
Why should I be worried?

691
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,480
All the students who have been out are missing.

692
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,480
I suspect
that the Grand Chrysanthemum Master did it.

693
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,319
Yan Yan is missing?

694
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,079
Senior, calm down.

695
00:30:57,159 --> 00:30:57,880
Listen to me.

696
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,399
We must capture
the Grand Chrysanthemum Master

697
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,480
in order to find them.

698
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:02,960
I'll capture him tomorrow!

699
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,439
Actually,

700
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,720
there's another personal reason.

701
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,720
Probably,

702
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:11,960
only he knows

703
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,360
where Hao Tian Soul Master is.

704
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,039
Don't worry.

705
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,159
We will capture him.

706
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:18,840
I've checked

707
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,720
the Grand Chrysanthemum Master's schedule.

708
00:31:20,199 --> 00:31:21,279
After Cang Hui's match tomorrow,

709
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:22,240
he'll leave the arena.

710
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,840
His route back to Martial Soul Hall

711
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:26,679
is here.

712
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:27,520
You may take a look

713
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:28,760
and choose a place to ambush him.

714
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,240
How do you get this?

715
00:31:32,199 --> 00:31:33,640
Hu Lie Na from Martial Soul Hall
gave it to me.

716
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,880
Martial Soul Hall can be hard to deal with.

717
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,520
You'd better not have

718
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,600
any relationship with them.

719
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:41,880
Understood.

720
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,840
We were just cooperating this time.

721
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:46,600
With me, Ning Feng Zhi,

722
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,000
and the Grand Sword Master,

723
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,000
we'll succeed.

724
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,799
There won't be a mistake.

725
00:31:59,120 --> 00:31:59,679
Master.

726
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:01,559
Master.

727
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:04,039
Tang San!

728
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,159
Help me tie it.

729
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:05,520
Let me have a look.

730
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,199
Can you be gentler?

731
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:06,799
It's tight now.

732
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,880
You shouldn't be so weak.

733
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,760
When is Rong Rong coming?

734
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,799
I'll call her.

735
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,399
Your opponent in the semi-final

736
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,000
is likely to be Cang Hui.

737
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:23,439
Look carefully

738
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,840
at their Martial Soul Types.

739
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,720
Then we'll discuss together

740
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,399
what tactic to be used.

741
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,799
Are you both exchanging love glances?

742
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:33,880
What are you talking about?

743
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,640
Oh right.

744
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,159
Where did you go yesterday?

745
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,319
Master and Teacher Liu

746
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:39,319
made so many great dishes,

747
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,199
but you weren't there.

748
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,279
We were discussing
Martial Soul Hall's Battle Team.

749
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,240
Really?

750
00:32:46,439 --> 00:32:47,960
Even though there are only a few of them,

751
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,199
they are indeed very strong.

752
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,640
Then what tactic should we use

753
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,880
against the three people from Martial Soul Hall?

754
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:54,720
I suspect

755
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:55,960
Xie Yue

756
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,319
has more than Quadruple Soul Rings.

757
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,720
No way.

758
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,799
Not many Soul Masters at this age

759
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,520
have Quadruple Soul Rings.

760
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,079
If he has Five Soul Rings,

761
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:06,399
how can we fight him?

762
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:07,760
Life is not a competition.

763
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,399
It won't pick a suitable opponent

764
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:10,240
for you every time.

765
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,439
Back then, when Lander, Er Long, and I

766
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:13,760
were wandering Douluo Continent,

767
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,840
we met strong opponents many times.

768
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:18,399
Fate puts the enemy you can't defeat

769
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,240
in front of you.

770
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,559
There is no time to grieve.

771
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:22,840
You can only face it.

772
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:27,919
Don't think about the match much later.

773
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,720
Look carefully at Cang Hui,

774
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,600
and win each time.

775
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,159
Alright!

776
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:33,559
We can do it.

777
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:41,279
Tang San.

778
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,760
What's wrong?

779
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:44,799
Nothing.

780
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,480
I've promised you

781
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,000
that after you enter the final,

782
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:26,119
I'll bring you

783
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:27,679
to meet Hao Tian Soul Master.

784
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:28,919
Now,

785
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,119
I'm here to fulfill my promise.

786
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,240
You are bringing me to him?

787
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,760
He's waiting for you.

788
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,679
If nothing goes wrong,

789
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,439
the semi-final will be

790
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,879
Cang Hui versus Shi Lan Ke.

791
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,679
I'm here to tell you in advance

792
00:34:46,439 --> 00:34:48,000
that Cang Hui School must win.

793
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,280
So,

794
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:50,960
please cooperate.

795
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,639
You want us to surrender?

796
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,040
Surrender seems bad.

797
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:57,960
I only want the result.

798
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,520
As for the process,

799
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,399
you can do whatever you want.

800
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:02,960
Fake fight?

801
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,359
The prize for the champion

802
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:05,800
is only two Soul Bones.

803
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,520
If you cooperate,

804
00:35:07,879 --> 00:35:09,919
I can give one to each of your teammates.

805
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:13,199
All the hard training we had at school

806
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,480
is not for fake fights.

807
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,320
Like I said,

808
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,399
I only want the result.

809
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,359
You're humiliating the contest

810
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,520
and also

811
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,560
the participants who have trained hard.

812
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,919
Don't reject me so soon.

813
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:28,760
The person you wish to see

814
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,040
is waiting for you inside.
