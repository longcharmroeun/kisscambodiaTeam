14
00:01:43,878 --> 00:01:45,039
Aren't you their comrade?

15
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,159
Why aren't you following them?

16
00:01:47,198 --> 00:01:48,439
Aren't you their friend?

17
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,558
Why don't you go then?

18
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:58,359
How are we going to find the Sand Beast
when the sandstorm is so strong?

19
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,759
We should be able to find it

20
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:00,759
if we head to the place
where the sandstorm is dense.

21
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,238
Let's untie the rope first.

22
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,039
If we can't contact each other later,

23
00:02:11,558 --> 00:02:13,759
just escape by teleporting
right away, all right?

24
00:02:21,038 --> 00:02:21,719
Listen to me, okay?

25
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:42,278
You can't move any further at all.

26
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,079
It sounds like it's somewhere nearby.

27
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:49,159
Your child is with me.

28
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:52,959
It's not working.

29
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:01,799
It's here.

30
00:03:02,478 --> 00:03:03,799
Wu, stay back.

31
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,638
Don't go there!

32
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:08,799
It's furious right now.

33
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,918
It's holding itself back because

34
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:16,118
you're still holding its kid.

35
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,079
What should I do then?

36
00:03:23,478 --> 00:03:24,359
We can't communicate with it at all.

37
00:03:24,478 --> 00:03:25,478
It's very agitated right now.

38
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:27,799
We still have to give it a try.

39
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,918
We mean no harm.

40
00:03:32,558 --> 00:03:33,719
Your kid is with me.

41
00:03:34,198 --> 00:03:35,359
I'll put him down now.

42
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,319
Wu, teleport now!

43
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,239
No!

44
00:03:48,918 --> 00:03:49,758
I told you to listen to me.

45
00:03:57,678 --> 00:03:58,838
We really didn't harm it at all.

46
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,678
We are not lying.

47
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:23,479
The sandstorm subsided.

48
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:28,798
Wu, are you okay?

49
00:04:29,398 --> 00:04:30,358
Brother, I'm fine.

50
00:04:32,358 --> 00:04:32,999
Let's go back.

51
00:04:35,558 --> 00:04:36,118
Tang San!

52
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:37,759
Brother San!

53
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,278
Wu!

54
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:39,039
Brother San!

55
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,639
Ou Si Ke.

56
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:40,398
Sister Wu!

57
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:41,479
Ma Hong Jun.

58
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:43,319
Brother San.

59
00:04:44,078 --> 00:04:44,678
Are you okay?

60
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:45,759
I'm fine.

61
00:04:45,838 --> 00:04:46,199
Where are Headmaster and others?

62
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:46,639
Why are you guys here?

63
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,439
I... I don't know.

64
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,919
Never mind, let's talk after we go back.

65
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:50,319
Let's go.

66
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:50,639
Let's go.

67
00:04:51,118 --> 00:04:52,199
Come on.

68
00:05:08,838 --> 00:05:10,719
The sandstorm subsided.
Everybody is safe now.

69
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:11,879
There are so many people here.

70
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:12,919
Hu Lie Na is here as well.

71
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,118
Good job.

72
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,599
You're quite good.

73
00:05:18,238 --> 00:05:19,118
Take a break

74
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,558
before you proceed with the test.

75
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:24,319
I don't need a break. I can go
with you guys right away.

76
00:05:25,118 --> 00:05:25,919
What test is he talking about?

77
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,078
You're here to wait for them?

78
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,879
I've seen your ability.

79
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:31,639
You have the potential.

80
00:05:32,518 --> 00:05:33,479
Does that mean...

81
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,159
he doesn't have to go into the arena?

82
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:38,919
Let me test you using another way.

83
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,358
What should I do?

84
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:42,439
Now,

85
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,078
you have to kill the person

86
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,159
who caused the sandstorm.

87
00:05:48,838 --> 00:05:49,278
Hold on.

88
00:05:49,838 --> 00:05:51,039
You promised to keep me alive.

89
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,039
I won't do anything to you.

90
00:05:54,798 --> 00:05:55,919
He will be the one
who is going to kill you.

91
00:05:59,398 --> 00:06:01,039
It... it was a careless mistake.

92
00:06:01,678 --> 00:06:02,678
I don't deserve to die!

93
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:07,439
You'll pass the test if you kill him.

94
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,039
It's simple, right?

95
00:06:10,118 --> 00:06:10,798
He's right.

96
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,118
The sandstorm was just an accident.

97
00:06:13,838 --> 00:06:16,118
He deserves to be punished,
but not enough to be killed.

98
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:19,238
I know I'm at fault.

99
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,159
I'll take the responsibility

100
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:23,238
to rebuild Xi Si City.

101
00:06:25,238 --> 00:06:26,599
Don't you think you deserve to die?

102
00:06:36,118 --> 00:06:37,199
Don't look at me like that.

103
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,039
You said you want to
be on the same front with us,

104
00:06:42,118 --> 00:06:42,958
how can we believe you

105
00:06:44,518 --> 00:06:45,558
if you don't kill him?

106
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,039
Stop hesitating.

107
00:06:49,358 --> 00:06:50,919
Kill him and finish the test.

108
00:07:01,278 --> 00:07:01,919
I quit.

109
00:07:04,518 --> 00:07:06,159
Tang San, don't act recklessly.

110
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:11,838
You'd better think this through.

111
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:13,439
This is your only chance

112
00:07:14,118 --> 00:07:15,319
to join us.

113
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,639
Just consider that I failed my test.

114
00:07:18,558 --> 00:07:19,159
Let him go.

115
00:07:23,238 --> 00:07:24,919
Your friend is really disappointing.

116
00:07:28,678 --> 00:07:29,238
Royal family.

117
00:07:29,398 --> 00:07:30,078
What are you doing?

118
00:07:45,518 --> 00:07:47,479
I said I wanted to quit.

119
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,919
I'll kill him if you don't have
the guts to do so.

120
00:07:53,518 --> 00:07:54,479
Remember what you see today.

121
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,118
This is what will happen to

122
00:07:56,719 --> 00:07:57,999
those who are against us.

123
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,639
I can't believe

124
00:08:03,518 --> 00:08:04,599
Officer Ye Zhi Qiu

125
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:07,199
would appreciate such a weak guy like you.

126
00:08:10,678 --> 00:08:11,199
Let's go.

127
00:08:11,798 --> 00:08:12,358
Wait a minute.

128
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:17,398
Are you trying to make up for it?
It's too late.

129
00:08:20,558 --> 00:08:21,999
I saw a lot of corpses being exposed
under the sunlight

130
00:08:23,118 --> 00:08:25,078
on my way to Xi Si City.

131
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:27,759
You were the ones who did that?

132
00:08:29,278 --> 00:08:29,879
You're right.

133
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:32,838
Those are the people we defeated.

134
00:08:33,238 --> 00:08:34,159
They deserved to die.

135
00:08:35,358 --> 00:08:36,159
I heard people crying

136
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:38,278
in the city,

137
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:40,598
because you guys

138
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,759
killed their family.

139
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:45,558
You think having power

140
00:08:47,598 --> 00:08:48,678
means justice.

141
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:51,199
However, in the eyes of others,

142
00:08:52,478 --> 00:08:54,598
you guys are just
a bunch of blood-sucking beasts.

143
00:08:55,439 --> 00:08:57,118
You guys are the cause of despair.

144
00:08:58,319 --> 00:08:59,478
What are you trying to say?

145
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:04,439
I want to challenge you all

146
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:06,759
at the Soul Arena Competition.

147
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:09,678
I told you

148
00:09:10,558 --> 00:09:12,038
that you've failed your test.

149
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:14,879
This has nothing to do with the test.

150
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,478
I want to destroy you guys head-on

151
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:19,519
and chase people like you

152
00:09:20,358 --> 00:09:21,718
out of Xi Si City.

153
00:09:22,319 --> 00:09:24,639
Tang San, are you crazy?

154
00:09:26,718 --> 00:09:28,478
Cruelty will not bring hope.

155
00:09:29,558 --> 00:09:32,678
I will save this city.

156
00:09:35,238 --> 00:09:35,839
All right.

157
00:09:39,118 --> 00:09:40,038
One day later,

158
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:41,918
I'll be waiting for you
in the Soul Arena.

159
00:09:44,358 --> 00:09:45,118
I would love to see

160
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:47,319
how you are going to defeat me

161
00:09:48,598 --> 00:09:49,399
and how you are going to

162
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,839
save this city.

163
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,439
Luckily Headmaster knows how to fly.

164
00:10:12,918 --> 00:10:14,118
That was why he found us.

165
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:16,519
Fortunately, the sandstorm stopped.

166
00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:18,718
Otherwise, I won't be able
to save so many people.

167
00:10:20,598 --> 00:10:22,678
Master,
is Zhu Zhu Qing really all right?

168
00:10:24,038 --> 00:10:24,839
You asked this question a dozen times.

169
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:25,558
He's worried about you.

170
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:26,478
She's fine.

171
00:10:26,798 --> 00:10:28,319
She'll be fine after a few days of rest.

172
00:10:28,798 --> 00:10:30,199
Where are Tang San and Wu?

173
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:31,759
They might be in the inn.

174
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,399
They don't know
any other places, anyway.

175
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,678
Come on in.

176
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:38,918
You guys are really here.

177
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:41,959
What happened to you guys?

178
00:10:42,038 --> 00:10:43,079
What happened?
Why are your clothes so dirty?

179
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:43,598
What's wrong?

180
00:10:43,598 --> 00:10:44,399
Did you get caught in the sandstorm?

181
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:47,279
What happened?

182
00:10:47,798 --> 00:10:48,718
We buried

183
00:10:50,558 --> 00:10:51,718
a body here just now.

184
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,279
What's going on?

185
00:10:57,678 --> 00:10:57,999
There's...

186
00:10:59,238 --> 00:11:00,598
There's a Fiend Battle Team in this city.

187
00:11:01,598 --> 00:11:02,319
They killed someone

188
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,038
from the Royal family here earlier.

189
00:11:05,718 --> 00:11:06,478
Ma Xiu Nuo.

190
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:09,158
Where are Tang San and Wu?

191
00:11:09,358 --> 00:11:10,158
Where did they go?

192
00:11:11,358 --> 00:11:12,598
They...they went out.

193
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:14,918
What is exactly happening?

194
00:11:46,798 --> 00:11:48,079
If the mastermind behind

195
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,118
Ye Zhi Qiu and his people

196
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,558
is really my father,

197
00:11:53,118 --> 00:11:53,999
what should I do?

198
00:11:56,798 --> 00:11:57,718
I've always thought

199
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,759
that I would take his side

200
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,718
no matter what he did.

201
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:05,759
However, now...

202
00:12:07,718 --> 00:12:08,639
Now what?

203
00:12:09,158 --> 00:12:10,279
Now, I really hope that

204
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:13,118
those people from the Fiend Battle Team
are not his men.

205
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:14,639
Without any conviction,

206
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:16,839
they killed people
based on their identity.

207
00:12:17,678 --> 00:12:18,879
They also kill people who are against them.

208
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,279
They're all crazy.

209
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,678
What they're doing is wrong.

210
00:12:24,798 --> 00:12:26,959
Is it possible that Ye Zhi Qiu is lying?

211
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:28,999
It's also possible

212
00:12:29,319 --> 00:12:32,079
that Grand Hao Tian Master
simply has the name as Uncle Tang.

213
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:33,478
Moreover,

214
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,639
you told me about him previously.

215
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:38,879
All he did were sleeping, drinking

216
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:39,918
and forging iron.

217
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:42,279
Plus, I've seen Uncle Tang before.

218
00:12:43,478 --> 00:12:44,519
He doesn't look like

219
00:12:44,718 --> 00:12:45,839
a bad guy at all.

220
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:51,238
I have no idea.

221
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,759
Coming to think of it,

222
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:56,118
it seems that the father I knew

223
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:58,478
is nothing like him.

224
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,879
How was he like

225
00:13:03,358 --> 00:13:04,478
in real life then?

226
00:13:10,798 --> 00:13:11,718
That's what I'd like to know.

227
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:14,718
I worked hard to become stronger

228
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:17,678
so that I can find him
and know him.

229
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,639
I must go to Tian Dou City.

230
00:13:22,238 --> 00:13:23,918
It doesn't matter
even if I fail the test.

231
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:26,959
I will find the man behind

232
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:27,759
Cang Hui School.

233
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,238
If it's really him,

234
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:34,158
I'll try to convince him.

235
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:36,558
I can't let him go down the wrong road.

236
00:13:40,678 --> 00:13:41,798
What if

237
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:44,519
he refuses to listen?

238
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:49,999
I will stop him.

239
00:13:51,118 --> 00:13:51,678
I will.

240
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:54,879
I'll go with you.

241
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:58,718
I'm his son.

242
00:14:01,358 --> 00:14:03,199
However, I don't even know

243
00:14:04,238 --> 00:14:05,358
if I've made the right choice.

244
00:14:17,918 --> 00:14:18,478
Here you are.

245
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,038
Thank you.

246
00:14:26,038 --> 00:14:26,798
Good luck.

247
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:32,839
You must win the battle.

248
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,639
What do you mean?

249
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:39,999
It doesn't matter whether you win the battle,
but you must stay alive.

250
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,918
Yes, you must come back alive.

251
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,319
Take care of yourself.

252
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,439
You've made the right choice.

253
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,598
I will beat the Fiend Battle Team.

254
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,079
I just came back from the Soul Arena.

255
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,079
Although the Fiend Battle Team
had the place under control,

256
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,639
I still managed to find out

257
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:17,598
some of their information
and achievements.

258
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:24,439
The majority of the people from the Fiend
Battle Team have Quadruple Soul Rings.

259
00:15:24,918 --> 00:15:26,319
They're people who stand out the most

260
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:27,639
even if they're from other Soul Master Schools.

261
00:15:27,798 --> 00:15:28,798
Our skills are way more lacking

262
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,999
compared to them.

263
00:15:31,478 --> 00:15:32,158
I've asked around.

264
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,079
Although they have a high rank,

265
00:15:34,358 --> 00:15:35,478
their training is not systematic enough.

266
00:15:35,598 --> 00:15:36,358
They're just amateurs.

267
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:38,319
Basically, their skills
are not as good as

268
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,478
the real Quadruple Soul Rings Soul Sect.

269
00:15:41,158 --> 00:15:43,038
Even so, Tang San is still not a match for them.

270
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:44,839
Do you have any other ways

271
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,358
to make up for it?

272
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:47,918
I want to see

273
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:48,798
how Tang San will deal with them.

274
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:50,759
How can he do it if you can't do it?

275
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:52,358
Pressure can make people grow.

276
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:56,598
So what are you planning to do?

277
00:15:58,519 --> 00:15:59,358
Spread despair.

278
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:08,519
Sister Qing.

279
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:11,879
They're all ranked
Quadruple Soul Rings. So what?

280
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,399
Your brother is ranked
Quadruple Soul Rings as well.

281
00:16:13,718 --> 00:16:15,598
Can all of you beat him
even if you join hands?

282
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:16,399
That's...

283
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:17,839
The bad news is...

284
00:16:19,118 --> 00:16:20,478
there's no hope in winning at all.

285
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:21,879
You're going to die
if you go into the arena.

286
00:16:22,678 --> 00:16:23,399
The good news is...

287
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:24,639
Tang San will be the only one
taking up the challenge.

288
00:16:25,038 --> 00:16:26,158
So there's no need for you guys
to get into the arena.

289
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,959
Is... is this what Headmaster wants?

290
00:16:29,358 --> 00:16:30,798
I'm just telling you guys the truth.

291
00:16:31,118 --> 00:16:31,879
I won't interfere

292
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:32,959
in anything you do.

293
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,598
Are we clear?

294
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,199
Master made himself very clear.

295
00:16:48,558 --> 00:16:49,439
You'll die if you enter the arena.

296
00:16:50,118 --> 00:16:50,879
Tang San started this mess,

297
00:16:51,238 --> 00:16:51,798
it's none of our business.

298
00:16:54,718 --> 00:16:55,678
What do you mean?

299
00:16:57,478 --> 00:16:58,118
Don't you get it?

300
00:16:58,478 --> 00:17:00,319
You want brother San
to enter the arena alone?

301
00:17:00,598 --> 00:17:01,879
Tang San was the one
who acted recklessly,

302
00:17:02,118 --> 00:17:02,918
does it have anything to do with us?

303
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,079
Dai Mu Bai!

304
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,038
Dai Mu Bai!

305
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:09,598
What? Do you want to fight?

306
00:17:10,158 --> 00:17:10,678
Let's fight outside.

307
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:11,399
Brother Dai!

308
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:12,198
All of you stay here.

309
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:14,318
No, don't be angry.

310
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:24,799
Aren't we going back to the hotel?

311
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:26,078
There's no need for us to rush.

312
00:17:26,598 --> 00:17:27,679
I'm looking for a smithy.

313
00:17:28,598 --> 00:17:29,879
I saw it somewhere yesterday.

314
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:32,759
There it is.

315
00:17:38,438 --> 00:17:39,078
Hi, Sir.

316
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,879
We would like to borrow your smithy
to make some fine iron.

317
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:43,919
May I know what the price is?

318
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:49,679
Didn't he understand what I said?

319
00:17:50,838 --> 00:17:51,679
I'm not sure.

320
00:17:52,598 --> 00:17:53,598
Are you going to forge iron again?

321
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:55,598
You saw it yourself.

322
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:58,438
All the people from the Fiend Battle Team
have Quadruple Soul Rings.

323
00:17:58,519 --> 00:17:59,238
We need some new weapons

324
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,399
to defeat them.

325
00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:02,679
New weapons?

326
00:18:04,478 --> 00:18:06,438
Brother, are you going to
cast sleeve arrows again?

327
00:18:07,598 --> 00:18:08,559
You'll find out soon.

328
00:18:09,478 --> 00:18:10,238
Let's go to another smithy.

329
00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:14,279
Is this enough?

330
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:16,559
Yes.

331
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:17,999
I'll make the fire bigger.

332
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,078
Sir, how much does this cost?

333
00:18:23,438 --> 00:18:26,039
I heard you're going to
challenge the Fiend Battle Team.

334
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:28,039
Yes.

335
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:30,639
I don't want any money.

336
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:32,799
I just want you to win.

337
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:43,519
Don't you think that I'll be afraid of you
just because I can't defeat you.

338
00:18:44,078 --> 00:18:44,559
You know what?

339
00:18:44,879 --> 00:18:46,399
I'm going to enter the arena
with Brother San tomorrow.

340
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,598
Keep it down.

341
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:49,358
Don't touch me. Let me go!

342
00:18:49,598 --> 00:18:50,519
Of course, I'll do the same.

343
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:53,639
What are you talking about?

344
00:18:54,838 --> 00:18:56,118
Tang San's Blue Silver Plant
has many uses,

345
00:18:56,438 --> 00:18:57,279
but it's not lethal enough.

346
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,159
I can make up for that weakness.

347
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:01,118
Moreover, you're a Mutant Soul.

348
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:02,519
If you go berserk in the arena,

349
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:04,238
it must be beyond
the Fiend Battle Team's expectation.

350
00:19:04,598 --> 00:19:05,358
You should be able to distract them.

351
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:07,159
I thought you're going to
ignore Brother San.

352
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:09,759
I'm the leader of Shi Lan Ke Team.

353
00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:10,879
Do you think I'll leave
my brother alone?

354
00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:15,679
So did you say that on purpose?

355
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,039
Our opponent is too strong.

356
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:22,838
So it won't affect our team's ability

357
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:23,879
even if Ou Si Ke and the rest

358
00:19:24,118 --> 00:19:24,958
don't join the battle.

359
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:26,679
There's no need for them
to get involved as well.

360
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,078
So you're not afraid of dying.

361
00:19:30,238 --> 00:19:30,999
I am afraid of dying?

362
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:32,598
Count me in.

363
00:19:33,358 --> 00:19:35,318
I can initiate a sneak attack in the arena.

364
00:19:37,358 --> 00:19:38,519
I asked you to stay inside.

365
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:10,799
That's right.

366
00:20:11,118 --> 00:20:12,598
This is the Random Air Hammer Skill.

367
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:13,838
That is what Tang San does best.

368
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:21,438
What is this?

369
00:20:22,198 --> 00:20:23,438
Wu, it's dangerous.

370
00:20:24,478 --> 00:20:25,838
Why is this dangerous?

371
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,718
It's so fast and powerful.

372
00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:38,759
It works pretty well.

373
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,958
Sir, do you have extra iron?

374
00:20:42,238 --> 00:20:42,759
Yes.

375
00:20:43,478 --> 00:20:44,879
I want to cast six more of them.

376
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:46,118
What are you going to do with them?

377
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:50,598
Wu, if I fail the challenge,

378
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,159
you must bring this weapon back
to Tian Dou City.

379
00:20:56,118 --> 00:20:57,958
This is to make sure Brother Dai
and the rest are well equipped

380
00:20:58,438 --> 00:20:59,318
when they join
the Soul Master School Contest.

381
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,679
After all, the more weapons they have,

382
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:03,238
the safer they will be.

383
00:21:07,718 --> 00:21:08,478
Promise me.

384
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:15,759
You said you have
something important to do

385
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:17,159
in Xi Si City.

386
00:22:17,358 --> 00:22:18,759
So it's to challenge the Fiend Battle Team?

387
00:22:19,318 --> 00:22:21,039
How are you going to
challenge them without us?

388
00:22:21,078 --> 00:22:21,679
That's right.

389
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:23,999
Brother Dai, listen to me.

390
00:22:24,438 --> 00:22:25,318
I'll deal with the challenge

391
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,958
on my own.

392
00:22:27,198 --> 00:22:29,559
Don't worry about me.
You guys should leave soon.

393
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:31,279
Don't let this affect
the Soul Master School Contest.

394
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:37,399
The opponents are too strong.
How can you beat them without me?

395
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,559
The Seven Devils of
Shi Lan Ken is a team.

396
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:41,478
Master said we have to
trust our teammates.

397
00:22:42,318 --> 00:22:42,879
So,

398
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,318
we won't leave you and Wu behind.

399
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:46,399
Brother San.

400
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:47,838
Sister Wu.

401
00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:49,238
You guys have already fought without us

402
00:22:49,438 --> 00:22:50,679
at Star Town.

403
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:52,958
Don't ever think of
leaving us behind this time.

404
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:56,639
Moreover,

405
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,879
I want to know the truth
behind the Mutant Soul.

406
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:00,519
We'll get one step closer
to finding out the real culprit

407
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:02,519
by defeating the Fiend Battle Team.

408
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:04,879
I have something to do with this matter.

409
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:06,559
So I must go into the arena tomorrow.

410
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:09,519
Tang San,

411
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:11,478
you're challenging the Fiend Battle Team

412
00:23:11,718 --> 00:23:13,238
to get closer to Ye Zhi Qiu

413
00:23:13,478 --> 00:23:15,318
and find out who is the person
behind the headquarter, aren't you?

414
00:23:16,999 --> 00:23:18,438
How did you guys know that?

415
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:19,879
I've always kept my mouth shut.

416
00:23:20,118 --> 00:23:21,399
I didn't tell any of them.

417
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,999
About Ye Zhi Qiu...

418
00:23:24,198 --> 00:23:25,879
Ou Si Ke might have overheard me

419
00:23:26,598 --> 00:23:29,078
when I was talking in my sleep.

420
00:23:33,598 --> 00:23:34,759
I'm from the Support Branch.

421
00:23:35,118 --> 00:23:37,159
I... I can't deal with it myself.

422
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:39,679
So I have to brainstorm

423
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:40,519
in order to...

424
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:42,039
Don't disgrace our Support Branch.

425
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:44,519
Tang San, forget about how I found out it.

426
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:47,438
Anyway, I can help you if you want to
do a background check on Ye Zhi Qiu.

427
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:49,399
Don't forget my identity.

428
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:50,838
I'm the mighty

429
00:23:50,838 --> 00:23:52,718
little princess of
the Qibao Amber Clan, OK?

430
00:23:53,078 --> 00:23:54,919
This is just a small matter.

431
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:57,799
After we defeat the Fiend Battle Team

432
00:23:57,999 --> 00:23:58,759
and return to Tian Dou City,

433
00:23:59,118 --> 00:24:00,039
I'll ask my father to help us out.

434
00:24:00,358 --> 00:24:01,438
We can find out right away

435
00:24:01,438 --> 00:24:02,718
what exactly Ye Zhi Qiu

436
00:24:02,838 --> 00:24:03,679
from Cang Hui School wants.

437
00:24:04,438 --> 00:24:06,039
You... you guys...

438
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,759
Is the Qibao Amber Clan

439
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:09,598
at Tian Dou City?

440
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,159
Of course the clan will be at
the tribe's headquarters.

441
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:14,478
After all, we're the three elders.

442
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:16,759
Of course we have people
garrisoned in Tian Dou City.

443
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:19,159
Also, I sensed

444
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:20,879
a mysterious dark power

445
00:24:20,879 --> 00:24:22,759
hiding and lurking in the dark.

446
00:24:23,118 --> 00:24:24,399
That was what caused
Ma Hong Jun to lose his family

447
00:24:24,438 --> 00:24:25,358
and Wu to be poisoned.

448
00:24:25,838 --> 00:24:26,279
So what?

449
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:28,198
Performing justice and protecting the weak

450
00:24:28,438 --> 00:24:30,238
is the mission of us from Shi Lan Ke.

451
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:31,159
Come on.

452
00:24:57,838 --> 00:24:59,118
Never leave anyone behind
and never give up.

453
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:00,399
That's great.

454
00:25:01,118 --> 00:25:02,519
It can be said that

455
00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:04,198
the team from Shi Lan Ke School

456
00:25:04,318 --> 00:25:06,598
is officially established
from today onwards.

457
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:08,958
Boss Lan, let's go.

458
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:11,639
Don't you want to hear

459
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,279
how they are going to
set up their tactics?

460
00:25:13,838 --> 00:25:14,639
It's not necessary.

461
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:18,919
This dish, this one

462
00:25:19,598 --> 00:25:21,478
and this one

463
00:25:22,198 --> 00:25:22,759
on this menu.

464
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:25,358
They are cheap.

465
00:25:26,238 --> 00:25:28,118
You're indeed a good brother of mine.
You even know how to save money for me.

466
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:28,958
What I meant was to

467
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:29,958
take out those dishes

468
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:32,279
and take everything else on the menu.

469
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:33,159
And also, make sure
the portion is big enough.

470
00:25:33,318 --> 00:25:35,279
We have to make sure that
they get enough breakfast

471
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:37,318
so that they can stay focused on
defeating the Fiend Battle Team.

472
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:39,279
Are you trying to let me go bankrupt?

473
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:41,279
What's wrong?

474
00:25:42,358 --> 00:25:43,519
You look a bit pale.

475
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:44,919
Didn't you sleep well yesterday?

476
00:25:45,118 --> 00:25:46,399
I have a severe headache.

477
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,958
You have to get some proper sleep tonight.

478
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,519
We still have to fight
a tough battle tomorrow.

479
00:25:49,838 --> 00:25:50,838
Let's go and order the food.

480
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:52,358
My headache is getting worse.

481
00:25:52,358 --> 00:25:53,559
We'll just do as you say.

482
00:25:55,718 --> 00:25:56,838
Our opponents all have
Quadruple Soul Rings.

483
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,078
We won't have any chance to win

484
00:25:58,438 --> 00:25:59,159
if we use conventional tactics.

485
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:00,799
So we need to plan out

486
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:01,958
what tactics we'll use tomorrow.

487
00:26:02,198 --> 00:26:02,879
Don't worry.

488
00:26:05,118 --> 00:26:06,438
Tang San has a special measure.

489
00:26:06,838 --> 00:26:07,639
What is this?

490
00:26:08,078 --> 00:26:08,639
What is this?

491
00:26:09,198 --> 00:26:10,679
This is called
the Godly Crossbow.

492
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,559
It's a mechanical type of weapon.

493
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:14,639
It's even better than my sleeve arrow.

494
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:15,919
Hurry up and show them.

495
00:26:18,838 --> 00:26:19,279
Ou Si Ke.

496
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:20,919
I'll... I'll stay away.

497
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:28,759
How did you do that?

498
00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:31,198
This is amazing!

499
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:33,159
It's so powerful.

500
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:35,718
I bet it can penetrate through metal.

501
00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:36,358
That's right.

502
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,118
It has high invincibility.

503
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:40,238
The enemies won't notice it

504
00:26:40,438 --> 00:26:41,438
when you wear them on
your wrist without shooting.

505
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:43,078
It can attack your enemies suddenly

506
00:26:43,118 --> 00:26:44,399
and catch them off guard.

507
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:47,279
Be careful with it.

508
00:26:47,879 --> 00:26:48,519
Tang San,

509
00:26:49,238 --> 00:26:51,078
where did you get this from?

510
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,039
I made it.

511
00:26:52,238 --> 00:26:53,039
Did you make this?

512
00:26:53,718 --> 00:26:54,718
How do you know how to make this?

513
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:55,639
My father is a blacksmith.

514
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:57,718
Do you have a blueprint for this?

515
00:26:58,838 --> 00:26:59,358
No.

516
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:00,598
You don't have a blueprint?

517
00:27:01,318 --> 00:27:03,198
Where did you get the source then?

518
00:27:03,358 --> 00:27:04,999
I promised my father
to keep it a secret.

519
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:06,279
All right.

520
00:27:06,879 --> 00:27:07,478
I get it!

521
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:08,718
I think

522
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,559
it is because Tang San's father is
a blacksmith.

523
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:12,159
That's why he must have recorded

524
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:12,838
the steps to make this weapon.

525
00:27:13,118 --> 00:27:13,999
This is what we call

526
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:15,598
like father, like son.

527
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:17,279
You're following in
your father's footsteps, right?

528
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:17,999
That's right.

529
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:19,358
Is the principle of using this Godly Crossbow

530
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:20,879
the same as that of the gold thread weapon

531
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:21,999
you used previously?

532
00:27:22,078 --> 00:27:23,279
The golden thread
that you mentioned,

533
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,519
I call it the Dragon's Beard.

534
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:27,279
The working principle is
the same as the sleeve arrow.

535
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:29,759
You'll need Soul Power
to use the Dragon's Beard,

536
00:27:31,078 --> 00:27:32,318
but that's not the case
for this Godly Crossbow.

537
00:27:32,639 --> 00:27:33,279
Look.

538
00:27:34,078 --> 00:27:37,118
It depends on the springs to work.

539
00:27:37,438 --> 00:27:38,559
It has a mechanical principle.

540
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,039
If you use a good spring,

541
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:42,039
you won't need
any Soul Power to fire it.

542
00:27:42,198 --> 00:27:43,399
Even an ordinary person

543
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:44,679
can use it easily.

544
00:27:45,078 --> 00:27:46,039
Based on my calculations,

545
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:47,519
the possibility for Soul Masters

546
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:49,799
below the Soul Honour
rank to fend off the blow

547
00:27:50,358 --> 00:27:51,639
from this Godly Crossbow is extremely low.

548
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,118
Moreover, this Godly Crossbow

549
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:54,999
has a great capability in controlling

550
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:56,879
Soul Masters beyond the Defence Branch.

551
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,999
Will all of us have these?

552
00:27:59,238 --> 00:28:01,279
I wanted to give these

553
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:02,198
to all of you as a present

554
00:28:02,358 --> 00:28:03,358
when you guys arrive at Tian Dou City

555
00:28:04,078 --> 00:28:05,318
to help you guys out

556
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,679
at the Soul Master School Contest.

557
00:28:07,718 --> 00:28:08,358
I didn't expect

558
00:28:09,238 --> 00:28:10,639
that all of you would stay with me.

559
00:28:11,598 --> 00:28:12,639
That's great.

560
00:28:13,198 --> 00:28:15,679
By the way, I would need
both of you to work with me tomorrow

561
00:28:16,118 --> 00:28:17,318
to use that tactic.

562
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:18,318
No problem.

563
00:28:18,598 --> 00:28:20,078
You're the tactical commander
in Shi Lan Ke School.

564
00:28:20,118 --> 00:28:20,838
We'll follow your instructions.

565
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,598
Guys, do you think I'll look

566
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:26,679
handsome and charming

567
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:27,919
if I use this crossbow?

568
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:29,399
Stop flattering yourself.

569
00:28:30,598 --> 00:28:31,279
Please be extra careful.

570
00:28:31,318 --> 00:28:32,718
Please don't use it on other people.

571
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,759
Tang San, teach me

572
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,159
how does this work?

573
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:39,598
Be careful.

574
00:28:39,879 --> 00:28:41,438
Put this on before you use it.

575
00:28:41,438 --> 00:28:41,958
Tang San,

576
00:28:43,838 --> 00:28:46,039
I've never liked these weapons before.

577
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:47,799
I thought your tactics won't work

578
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:49,718
in the arena,

579
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:52,478
but after experiencing some things,

580
00:28:53,078 --> 00:28:53,598
I got to know that

581
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,799
you're a smart and passionate person.

582
00:28:56,958 --> 00:28:58,358
I shouldn't have ostracized you

583
00:28:58,919 --> 00:28:59,639
just because we use
different methods to deal with stuff.

584
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,159
We must let them know how strong

585
00:29:02,358 --> 00:29:03,238
Shi Lan Ke is in tomorrow's battle.

586
00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:03,999
All right!

587
00:29:04,238 --> 00:29:04,759
We'll gain victory!

588
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:05,559
We'll gain victory!

589
00:29:11,358 --> 00:29:12,238
Just a heads-up,

590
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:14,598
we teachers won't be involved

591
00:29:17,838 --> 00:29:19,238
in today's battle.

592
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,999
You have to
depend on yourself to win.

593
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,039
OK! Yes!

594
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:25,799
Let's get ready.
We'll leave in fifteen minutes.

595
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:26,919
Let's go.

596
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:27,598
Let's go.

597
00:29:28,838 --> 00:29:29,438
What's wrong?

598
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,639
She pulled Tang San away alone.

599
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:35,118
Is there anything wrong?

600
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:37,358
What's wrong with that?

601
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:39,519
They're alone!

602
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:41,238
What do you think

603
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:42,799
she has to say to him in private?

604
00:29:43,838 --> 00:29:44,438
I don't know.

605
00:29:46,198 --> 00:29:47,598
There must be something going on.

606
00:29:48,318 --> 00:29:49,438
Why are you not worried?

607
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,078
They're just talking to each other.

608
00:29:51,238 --> 00:29:52,039
What is there to worry about?

609
00:29:52,078 --> 00:29:52,999
What do you mean by "they're just talking"?

610
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:55,238
You're such a fool. I quit.

611
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:56,358
Just give up.

612
00:29:57,238 --> 00:29:58,679
All of them have Quadruple Soul Rings.
How are you going to beat them?

613
00:29:59,118 --> 00:30:00,399
Don't you know
they'll just simply kill people

614
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,238
in the Soul Arena?

615
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:02,318
I know that,

616
00:30:02,999 --> 00:30:04,279
but I still want to give it a try.

617
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,078
Even if they're very cruel,

618
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:08,718
what does it have to do with us?

619
00:30:10,198 --> 00:30:11,759
If everybody thinks the same way as you,

620
00:30:12,879 --> 00:30:13,999
this city will be doomed,

621
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:16,919
but thank you for your suggestion anyway.

622
00:30:17,118 --> 00:30:17,879
Listen to me.

623
00:30:18,838 --> 00:30:19,919
If you didn't save me previously,

624
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:20,838
I wouldn't even care about you.

625
00:30:24,318 --> 00:30:25,438
How about we do it this way?

626
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,198
We can leave first,

627
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:29,759
and I'll send someone
to deal with them later on.

628
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:30,519
Is that okay?

629
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:31,559
The longer we wait,

630
00:30:31,879 --> 00:30:33,318
the more people they harm.

631
00:31:48,358 --> 00:31:49,639
The Godly Crossbow only works one time.

632
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:52,159
It's our only chance.

633
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,879
We'll stall for time and
divert the opponents' attention.

634
00:31:55,399 --> 00:31:56,118
We'll have to kill them in one blow.

635
00:31:57,879 --> 00:31:59,238
You're dragging so many people
to die with you?

636
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:01,039
Wang Sheng,

637
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,399
you deal with your own friends.

638
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:05,598
However,

639
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:08,159
how are we going to
explain this to Officer Ye Zhi Qiu?

640
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:16,238
I'll give you one last chance.

641
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:17,399
Join us.

642
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:19,159
Tang San!

643
00:32:47,318 --> 00:32:49,838
Full Recovery Big Sausage!

644
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,478
Strength Boost! Speed Boost!

645
00:33:01,958 --> 00:33:02,759
As you can see,

646
00:33:03,999 --> 00:33:05,438
Officer Ye Zhi Qiu got the wrong guy.

647
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:08,598
I'll explain it to him.

648
00:33:11,118 --> 00:33:11,799
Here,

649
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:14,159
there are no rules, only life or death.

650
00:33:14,718 --> 00:33:15,559
Even if you guys surrender,

651
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:17,999
we'll hunt you down.

652
00:33:18,838 --> 00:33:21,478
This city belongs to us.

653
00:33:22,238 --> 00:33:23,478
Ou Si Ke! Ning Rong Rong!

654
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:29,159
The Support Branch
is taking action as well?

655
00:33:37,718 --> 00:33:38,159
Hong Jun!

656
00:33:38,718 --> 00:33:39,478
Phoenix Firing Line!

657
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,198
A fight between two tigers.

658
00:35:16,238 --> 00:35:17,079
