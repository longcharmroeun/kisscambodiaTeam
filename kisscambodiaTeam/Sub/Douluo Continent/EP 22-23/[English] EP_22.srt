14
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,237
After the mutation,

15
00:01:45,678 --> 00:01:47,477
the force behind the Fiend Battle Team found me.

16
00:01:47,797 --> 00:01:48,398
They told me

17
00:01:49,237 --> 00:01:51,318
that whoever works alone will be bullied.

18
00:01:51,398 --> 00:01:52,597
But if we stick together,

19
00:01:53,157 --> 00:01:53,837
it will be different.

20
00:01:55,597 --> 00:01:57,318
If we are united

21
00:01:58,398 --> 00:01:59,157
and help each other,

22
00:01:59,638 --> 00:02:01,078
our fates could be changed.

23
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:03,078
That's why you joined the Fiend Battle Team?

24
00:02:04,038 --> 00:02:04,477
Yes.

25
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,998
I can't compare myself to Master Ye.

26
00:02:09,557 --> 00:02:11,477
I can only practice hard
in the Fiend Battle Team first.

27
00:02:12,277 --> 00:02:13,837
After hearing from Master Ye

28
00:02:14,197 --> 00:02:15,318
that you would come to have a test,

29
00:02:16,157 --> 00:02:17,157
I was extremely excited.

30
00:02:18,237 --> 00:02:19,157
I have been waiting for you.

31
00:02:19,918 --> 00:02:21,198
But I heard that the Fiend Battle Team

32
00:02:21,478 --> 00:02:22,918
killed many people in the Soul Arena.

33
00:02:23,157 --> 00:02:24,038
We couldn't help it.

34
00:02:24,717 --> 00:02:25,717
It was because they were weak.

35
00:02:25,997 --> 00:02:27,118
Why didn't you just drive them away

36
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:28,357
instead of killing them?

37
00:02:29,198 --> 00:02:30,118
Our captain said

38
00:02:30,558 --> 00:02:32,637
that we shouldn't spare anyone in a battle.

39
00:02:33,198 --> 00:02:35,077
We should spread the fear,

40
00:02:35,597 --> 00:02:37,318
and no one would dare to question us.

41
00:02:38,877 --> 00:02:39,877
It is too cruel.

42
00:02:40,838 --> 00:02:41,717
But it is very effective.

43
00:02:44,558 --> 00:02:45,437
Under the leadership of the captain,

44
00:02:46,118 --> 00:02:46,877
soon Xi Si City

45
00:02:47,678 --> 00:02:49,597
will be a territory of the Fiend Battle Team.

46
00:02:54,517 --> 00:02:55,797
I know what you are worrying about.

47
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:57,678
In our team,

48
00:02:58,157 --> 00:02:59,877
there are a few Soul Masters
with Quadruple Soul Rings

49
00:03:00,558 --> 00:03:01,437
that you can't defeat.

50
00:03:01,838 --> 00:03:04,038
But since you're introduced by Master Ye,

51
00:03:04,758 --> 00:03:05,997
the battle

52
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:07,597
will be just a symbolic test.

53
00:03:09,478 --> 00:03:10,958
As long as you can endure it for a while,

54
00:03:12,398 --> 00:03:13,478
you can pass the test.

55
00:03:13,717 --> 00:03:14,558
Not much risk.

56
00:03:16,558 --> 00:03:17,558
Why did you go

57
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:18,597
to that alley?

58
00:03:19,838 --> 00:03:20,558
The woman

59
00:03:21,157 --> 00:03:22,478
is the wife of a defeated Soul Master.

60
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:24,558
The captain asked me to throw her out of the city.

61
00:03:25,278 --> 00:03:26,637
And I happened to meet you.

62
00:03:27,678 --> 00:03:29,118
That's fine. I will deal with her later.

63
00:03:30,758 --> 00:03:32,077
She's just an ordinary person.

64
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:35,958
You're right. I won't kill her.

65
00:03:36,918 --> 00:03:37,357
Wang Sheng.

66
00:03:37,838 --> 00:03:39,318
I can understand

67
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:40,357
that you were tortured by Young Master Xiao.

68
00:03:41,198 --> 00:03:42,758
But you have no right
to impose your pains on others

69
00:03:43,038 --> 00:03:44,877
just as Xiao Chen Yu did to you.

70
00:03:47,118 --> 00:03:48,997
Have you forgotten that you were wanted?

71
00:03:49,278 --> 00:03:50,278
You were bullied as well.

72
00:03:50,838 --> 00:03:51,717
Someone told me

73
00:03:52,517 --> 00:03:53,597
that good people might do something wrong.

74
00:03:54,038 --> 00:03:55,118
Bad people might do something good.

75
00:03:55,478 --> 00:03:56,318
Be rational.

76
00:03:57,918 --> 00:03:58,797
The captain told me

77
00:03:59,637 --> 00:04:00,997
people who treat me nicely are good.

78
00:04:01,357 --> 00:04:02,318
Otherwise, they are all bad.

79
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:03,597
So you want to kill them all?

80
00:04:04,157 --> 00:04:05,237
If you are so merciless,

81
00:04:05,437 --> 00:04:06,758
you are no different

82
00:04:06,758 --> 00:04:07,398
from those people who you hate a lot.

83
00:04:07,517 --> 00:04:07,958
It's enough!

84
00:04:13,797 --> 00:04:14,237
Tang San.

85
00:04:15,398 --> 00:04:16,118
Don't let our captain

86
00:04:16,517 --> 00:04:17,318
hear what you said.

87
00:04:18,278 --> 00:04:18,797
It's for your own good.

88
00:04:19,357 --> 00:04:21,357
Wang Sheng, I think

89
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:22,038
you're not on the right track.

90
00:04:23,438 --> 00:04:25,958
You aren't going to do the test?

91
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:27,158
I will attend

92
00:04:27,678 --> 00:04:28,357
the battle.

93
00:04:33,037 --> 00:04:33,598
That's great.

94
00:04:37,037 --> 00:04:37,917
What if I don't attend?

95
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:41,438
Don't you know

96
00:04:42,757 --> 00:04:43,278
your matter

97
00:04:43,998 --> 00:04:45,757
is personally handled by Master Ye?

98
00:04:47,197 --> 00:04:47,998
The captain takes it seriously too.

99
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:51,878
If you don't turn up in the battle,

100
00:04:52,197 --> 00:04:54,237
I think that the captain will lead the team

101
00:04:54,797 --> 00:04:55,317
to arrest you.

102
00:04:56,678 --> 00:04:57,678
And kill me?

103
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:00,917
Since you've stayed,

104
00:05:01,598 --> 00:05:02,757
then we're comrades now.

105
00:05:03,517 --> 00:05:04,317
Don't think too much.

106
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,237
Tomorrow the captain and I

107
00:05:06,718 --> 00:05:08,278
will bring you to the Soul Arena.

108
00:05:09,278 --> 00:05:10,637
I'm sending a group of people
out of the city tomorrow.

109
00:05:12,357 --> 00:05:13,077
Are you escaping?

110
00:05:14,838 --> 00:05:15,398
I won't.

111
00:05:16,598 --> 00:05:18,598
I've been waiting for the battle for a long time.

112
00:05:19,558 --> 00:05:21,357
It's good then. As long as
you don't escape,

113
00:05:22,158 --> 00:05:23,558
your friends, including Wu,

114
00:05:23,838 --> 00:05:24,558
will be all right.

115
00:05:26,718 --> 00:05:28,398
You mean that if I try to escape,

116
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,197
you're going to hurt them?

117
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,797
The captain values you a lot.

118
00:05:35,197 --> 00:05:38,357
Who only knows how to kill people
is the worst Soul Master.

119
00:05:42,477 --> 00:05:45,197
Tang San, mind your words!

120
00:05:51,598 --> 00:05:54,718
Anyway, once the battle is over tomorrow,

121
00:05:55,558 --> 00:05:56,398
we will be on the same team.

122
00:05:57,237 --> 00:05:59,797
Stop saying the words that
you mentioned just now.

123
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:14,477
How do you feel? Do you get enough rest?

124
00:06:15,237 --> 00:06:17,517
I can still sleep for another day.

125
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:18,438
I can accompany you.

126
00:06:18,438 --> 00:06:18,757
Don't waste the time.

127
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:19,398
I don't want your company.

128
00:06:19,517 --> 00:06:21,037
Let's go to Tian Dou City.

129
00:06:21,678 --> 00:06:21,998
Okay.

130
00:06:21,998 --> 00:06:22,517
Headmaster.

131
00:06:23,757 --> 00:06:24,197
What's the matter?

132
00:06:25,838 --> 00:06:26,757
I send you guys off the city.

133
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:29,757
Brother San, what do you mean by that?

134
00:06:30,037 --> 00:06:30,678
You are not leaving?

135
00:06:31,398 --> 00:06:32,037
I have to stay.

136
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,598
Why?

137
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:36,718
I have a very important matter

138
00:06:37,477 --> 00:06:38,917
to do in Xi Si City.

139
00:06:39,757 --> 00:06:41,237
What is the matter that makes you leave us?

140
00:06:41,438 --> 00:06:42,037
Brother San.

141
00:06:42,118 --> 00:06:42,517
Yes.

142
00:06:42,558 --> 00:06:43,917
We're the Seven Devils of Shi Lan Ke.

143
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:45,718
We're all here for you.

144
00:06:45,797 --> 00:06:46,438
We will deal with it together.

145
00:06:46,678 --> 00:06:47,237
That's right.

146
00:06:47,357 --> 00:06:48,197
We can help you.

147
00:06:48,197 --> 00:06:48,878
Thank you, everyone.

148
00:06:49,517 --> 00:06:51,878
But I want to solve
the problem by myself.

149
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,237
I don't want to trouble you.

150
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:54,637
You're right.

151
00:06:55,037 --> 00:06:57,197
We shouldn't involve
Brother Dai and the others in it.

152
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,958
So, let them leave on their own.

153
00:06:59,237 --> 00:07:00,197
And I'll stay with you.

154
00:07:01,637 --> 00:07:02,158
Wu,

155
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,357
you have to go to Tian Dou City with them.

156
00:07:04,797 --> 00:07:06,197
There are the best Soul Masters and resources.

157
00:07:06,317 --> 00:07:07,158
This is not negotiable.

158
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:09,398
Wu will always stay where Tang San is.

159
00:07:09,718 --> 00:07:11,317
No matter where you choose to go,

160
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:12,958
I'll always be with you.

161
00:07:15,838 --> 00:07:16,637
You've already decided?

162
00:07:18,477 --> 00:07:19,278
I've already decided.

163
00:07:20,517 --> 00:07:21,197
What do you think?

164
00:07:25,718 --> 00:07:26,678
Shi Lan Ke School

165
00:07:27,037 --> 00:07:28,517
has been poor since its establishment.

166
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:31,438
But I'm proud of one thing.

167
00:07:32,197 --> 00:07:34,517
Apart from giving you knowledge and power,

168
00:07:35,477 --> 00:07:37,998
we teach you how to develop
your independent personalities.

169
00:07:40,237 --> 00:07:41,118
So, Tang San,

170
00:07:42,398 --> 00:07:43,998
no matter what your decision is,

171
00:07:44,637 --> 00:07:45,998
the school will always support you.

172
00:07:48,037 --> 00:07:49,878
Headmaster, even if I leave,

173
00:07:50,357 --> 00:07:51,998
I will always be a member of Shi Lan Ke.

174
00:07:52,678 --> 00:07:53,558
Me too.

175
00:07:53,757 --> 00:07:55,158
I will always be a member of Shi Lan Ke too.

176
00:07:57,037 --> 00:07:59,718
Master, I'm always your student.

177
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,477
What do you mean by that?

178
00:08:03,838 --> 00:08:04,917
Of course, you're my student.

179
00:08:05,398 --> 00:08:06,838
I won't leave you alone.

180
00:08:07,438 --> 00:08:07,878
Master...

181
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:09,197
Okay. That's it.

182
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:11,037
Let's

183
00:08:13,398 --> 00:08:14,398
send everyone off now.

184
00:08:29,998 --> 00:08:30,718
Master,

185
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,037
do you want to leave Brother San here?

186
00:08:35,197 --> 00:08:36,398
Every one of you in Shi Lan Ke

187
00:08:36,477 --> 00:08:37,718
will leave one day.

188
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:39,478
Do you want Shi Lan Ke

189
00:08:39,838 --> 00:08:41,197
to keep you forever?

190
00:08:43,877 --> 00:08:44,877
But you're an exception.

191
00:08:45,197 --> 00:08:46,958
You have to pay the debt you owed the school first

192
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:47,677
before you graduate.

193
00:08:48,077 --> 00:08:48,598
I...

194
00:08:49,398 --> 00:08:51,158
Master, I'm your direct disciple.

195
00:08:52,158 --> 00:08:54,158
I can consider reducing the interest.

196
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:01,437
Brother Dai,

197
00:09:01,798 --> 00:09:03,197
why does Tang San have to stay?

198
00:09:05,437 --> 00:09:06,197
He has his reason

199
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,038
not to tell it.

200
00:09:08,877 --> 00:09:10,358
Everyone has his secrets.

201
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,077
It's unnecessary to figure out the answer.

202
00:09:13,197 --> 00:09:13,997
Just believe him.

203
00:09:17,317 --> 00:09:18,517
You don't need our help?

204
00:09:19,598 --> 00:09:21,317
No. I'm okay to do it alone.

205
00:09:26,038 --> 00:09:26,718
All right.

206
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:28,317
We're leaving the city soon.

207
00:09:28,997 --> 00:09:29,918
Just leave us here.

208
00:09:42,197 --> 00:09:44,718
All right. Continue your journey now.

209
00:09:45,077 --> 00:09:46,278
Hopefully, we will

210
00:09:47,038 --> 00:09:47,997
meet again in Tian Dou City.

211
00:09:52,077 --> 00:09:52,637
Tang San.

212
00:09:55,598 --> 00:09:57,278
Come to me whenever you encounter any problems.

213
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,358
I'm always your headmaster.

214
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:06,557
Brother San.

215
00:10:09,398 --> 00:10:10,798
What happened? Stop crying.

216
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:11,877
Keep in mind what I've told you.

217
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:15,637
Never give up easily.

218
00:10:19,557 --> 00:10:20,557
Take care, Brother.

219
00:10:30,077 --> 00:10:30,637
All right.

220
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:34,718
What are you doing?

221
00:10:36,238 --> 00:10:38,637
Why didn't you tell us in advance?

222
00:10:39,117 --> 00:10:41,197
You leave us suddenly.

223
00:10:42,358 --> 00:10:43,958
How can I accept it?

224
00:10:50,238 --> 00:10:51,798
We'll meet again.

225
00:10:52,158 --> 00:10:54,478
Wu, tell us

226
00:10:55,117 --> 00:10:55,997
whenever you need our help.

227
00:10:58,517 --> 00:10:59,437
All right.

228
00:10:59,437 --> 00:11:00,437
Don't be sad.

229
00:11:01,517 --> 00:11:02,877
You meet and you depart.

230
00:11:02,877 --> 00:11:04,478
You depart and you will meet again.

231
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:06,997
You will leave Shi Lan Ke one day.

232
00:11:07,677 --> 00:11:09,677
There is a bigger stage waiting for you.

233
00:11:10,677 --> 00:11:11,278
Stop crying.

234
00:11:12,598 --> 00:11:13,158
Let's depart now.

235
00:11:18,918 --> 00:11:19,557
Let's go.

236
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:21,038
Take care of yourself.

237
00:11:21,038 --> 00:11:21,757
Take care, Brother Dai.

238
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:35,918
I asked you to leave with them.

239
00:11:36,517 --> 00:11:38,718
Look at yourself now.

240
00:11:39,677 --> 00:11:40,718
That's different.

241
00:11:41,437 --> 00:11:42,238
What is the difference?

242
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,598
Surely, I'll be sad when I leave them.

243
00:11:47,517 --> 00:11:48,677
But you're different.

244
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,398
I can't be separated from you.

245
00:11:51,637 --> 00:11:52,757
Why can't you be separated from me?

246
00:11:54,358 --> 00:11:55,317
If I'm separated from you,

247
00:11:55,877 --> 00:11:57,718
my heart seems to be emptied.

248
00:11:58,997 --> 00:12:01,077
But, no one can stay with another forever.

249
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:03,757
We can try.

250
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:09,877
All right. We'll try.

251
00:12:11,557 --> 00:12:12,238
Don't cry anymore.

252
00:12:16,478 --> 00:12:18,358
Cheer up, everyone!

253
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,077
Tang San said

254
00:12:20,317 --> 00:12:22,077
we might have the chance
to meet in Tian Dou City.

255
00:12:22,997 --> 00:12:23,877
Cheer up!

256
00:12:26,798 --> 00:12:28,117
Hello. May I know

257
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:29,637
where Xi Si City Soul Arena is?

258
00:12:34,677 --> 00:12:35,598
As you mentioned,

259
00:12:35,877 --> 00:12:37,398
you have to challenge the Fiend Battle Team

260
00:12:37,677 --> 00:12:38,838
in Xi Si City Soul Arena?

261
00:12:39,398 --> 00:12:41,197
Yes, when we were at Star Town,

262
00:12:41,197 --> 00:12:41,997
Ye Zhi Qiu told me

263
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:43,557
I could only meet with Hao Tian Soul Master

264
00:12:44,117 --> 00:12:45,598
after I had managed to defeat
the Fiend Battle Team.

265
00:12:47,557 --> 00:12:48,478
Hao Tian Soul Master

266
00:12:49,317 --> 00:12:50,677
is probably my father.

267
00:12:52,718 --> 00:12:55,437
All right. I will challenge

268
00:12:55,637 --> 00:12:57,557
the Fiend Battle Team with you!

269
00:13:04,598 --> 00:13:05,238
What is the sound?

270
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:11,637
What happened outside of the city?

271
00:13:23,117 --> 00:13:23,598
You...

272
00:13:23,918 --> 00:13:25,158
It's a sandstorm.

273
00:13:25,557 --> 00:13:26,278
Go back immediately.

274
00:13:27,437 --> 00:13:28,158
Don't squeeze.

275
00:13:31,117 --> 00:13:32,077
Find a place to hide.

276
00:13:32,117 --> 00:13:33,077
Hide now! Hurry up!

277
00:13:33,077 --> 00:13:34,117
Hurry up!

278
00:13:34,158 --> 00:13:34,757
Hide!

279
00:13:35,877 --> 00:13:36,557
Ou Si Ke.

280
00:13:50,637 --> 00:13:51,238
Master.

281
00:13:53,238 --> 00:13:53,798
Tang San.

282
00:13:54,598 --> 00:13:55,117
Master.

283
00:13:55,117 --> 00:13:55,677
Wu.

284
00:14:03,598 --> 00:14:04,238
Master.

285
00:14:04,598 --> 00:14:05,398
Master.

286
00:15:48,517 --> 00:15:49,278
Ma Hong Jun.

287
00:16:00,997 --> 00:16:01,798
Ma Hong Jun.

288
00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:13,598
Ma Hong Jun, please say something.

289
00:16:21,798 --> 00:16:23,437
Ma Hong Jun!

290
00:16:23,598 --> 00:16:24,757
Please say something! I'm calling you.

291
00:16:27,398 --> 00:16:28,557
Ma Hong Jun, what happened to you?

292
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:29,757
I...

293
00:16:30,437 --> 00:16:31,838
Ou Si Ke, it's me.

294
00:16:31,838 --> 00:16:32,398
Ou Si Ke.

295
00:16:32,877 --> 00:16:33,997
Let's go to look for Master now.

296
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:34,677
I don't want to go.

297
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:35,557
I don't want to go.

298
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,398
What happened to you? You're scared?

299
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,278
What are you doing here?

300
00:16:39,478 --> 00:16:40,038
Let's go.

301
00:16:40,798 --> 00:16:41,358
Hurry up.

302
00:16:41,677 --> 00:16:42,557
I don't want to go.

303
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,437
Are you going to stay here forever?

304
00:16:47,478 --> 00:16:47,997
I don't want to go.

305
00:17:00,877 --> 00:17:02,117
Ma Hong Jun, stop moving!

306
00:17:06,238 --> 00:17:07,958
Isn't this the Sand Beast?

307
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:10,798
Is this sandstorm caused

308
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:11,758
by the Sand Beast?

309
00:17:12,677 --> 00:17:13,797
Don't let it find out.

310
00:17:15,878 --> 00:17:17,478
I thought I was going to die.

311
00:17:19,718 --> 00:17:21,958
Brother Dai, thank you.

312
00:17:22,238 --> 00:17:23,797
If you hadn't saved me just now,

313
00:17:23,998 --> 00:17:25,317
I might have died already.

314
00:17:26,317 --> 00:17:28,197
I was not saving you, but Zhu Zhu Qing.

315
00:17:28,437 --> 00:17:29,197
I was just saving you both together.

316
00:17:29,838 --> 00:17:30,998
Anyway,

317
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:32,358
I have to thank you

318
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:33,277
for saving me.

319
00:17:34,838 --> 00:17:37,238
You said you saved Sister Qing,
but where is she?

320
00:17:37,998 --> 00:17:38,718
How do I know?

321
00:17:39,638 --> 00:17:40,677
Did you lose her?

322
00:17:44,677 --> 00:17:45,797
It's not your fault.

323
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:47,157
The situation was an emergency.

324
00:17:47,758 --> 00:17:48,917
It's normal if you lose her.

325
00:17:53,518 --> 00:17:54,358
What are you doing?

326
00:17:57,397 --> 00:17:58,998
The storm outside hasn't receded.

327
00:17:59,238 --> 00:18:01,797
You will die if you're swept away by the storm.

328
00:18:02,277 --> 00:18:02,958
Remember to shut the window.

329
00:18:10,838 --> 00:18:11,598
I don't want to die.

330
00:18:12,197 --> 00:18:12,758
I don't want to die.

331
00:18:13,758 --> 00:18:14,518
I don't want to die.

332
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,638
Stop moving if you don't want to die.

333
00:18:17,238 --> 00:18:17,758
Help.

334
00:18:17,838 --> 00:18:21,077
Help.

335
00:18:21,157 --> 00:18:21,797
Ma Hong Jun.

336
00:18:22,397 --> 00:18:23,118
Help.

337
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:23,998
Help.

338
00:18:35,518 --> 00:18:37,758
Help me.

339
00:18:52,878 --> 00:18:54,677
Why are you going wild now?

340
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:10,718
Please stop it now, Ma Hong Jun.

341
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,638
It will get angry if you keep hitting it.

342
00:19:44,998 --> 00:19:47,917
Zhu Zhu Qing.

343
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:10,758
Are you all right?

344
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:13,197
I'm fine.

345
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:18,077
Go. Leave me alone.

346
00:20:18,878 --> 00:20:19,557
Stop saying that.

347
00:20:19,797 --> 00:20:21,437
Strength Boost! Speed Boost!

348
00:20:22,677 --> 00:20:23,758
Get up here!

349
00:20:24,478 --> 00:20:25,077
Come on.

350
00:20:36,437 --> 00:20:37,197
Ma Hong Jun.

351
00:20:42,037 --> 00:20:43,437
You can't blame me for this.

352
00:20:44,598 --> 00:20:47,838
No one can save you as you get mad!

353
00:20:58,238 --> 00:21:01,037
Full Recovery Big Sausage!

354
00:21:04,838 --> 00:21:06,758
Eat this big sausage!

355
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:12,998
Ma Hong Jun!

356
00:21:16,518 --> 00:21:17,317
Wake up!

357
00:21:19,557 --> 00:21:20,838
Did I lose control again?

358
00:21:22,277 --> 00:21:23,358
What happened?

359
00:21:23,677 --> 00:21:25,197
You jumped out and hit it!

360
00:21:26,478 --> 00:21:27,557
Did I hit it?

361
00:21:27,557 --> 00:21:28,677
Let's go now. Stop talking too much!

362
00:21:42,358 --> 00:21:43,197
Are you hurt badly?

363
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:44,638
I can carry on.

364
00:21:45,118 --> 00:21:46,557
How did you get hurt?

365
00:21:47,478 --> 00:21:48,397
I hid well.

366
00:21:49,718 --> 00:21:50,598
I was hurt because I had to save him.

367
00:21:52,557 --> 00:21:54,638
She hid well

368
00:21:54,797 --> 00:21:55,998
and you caused her injury.

369
00:21:58,958 --> 00:21:59,598
I'm sorry.

370
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:02,797
Does it still hurt?

371
00:22:06,037 --> 00:22:07,437
Did I get it wrong?

372
00:22:08,157 --> 00:22:09,437
Dai Mu Bai admitted his mistake.

373
00:22:14,478 --> 00:22:16,638
Thank you. Had it not been for you,

374
00:22:17,197 --> 00:22:18,077
it would have been dangerous.

375
00:22:20,118 --> 00:22:20,878
That's nothing.

376
00:22:23,317 --> 00:22:25,277
What happened to him?

377
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:27,437
Why does he become nicer?

378
00:22:28,878 --> 00:22:29,478
Is your bone okay?

379
00:22:30,157 --> 00:22:31,557
Do you want to bandage the wound first?

380
00:22:32,037 --> 00:22:33,518
It's fine. I don't think I hurt the bone.

381
00:22:35,358 --> 00:22:36,037
Stop moving.

382
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:37,838
Wait until the sandstorm is over.

383
00:22:38,518 --> 00:22:39,557
We'll find a doctor for this.

384
00:22:40,238 --> 00:22:40,797
I wonder

385
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:42,797
how Tang San and Wu are doing now?

386
00:22:46,277 --> 00:22:47,917
I think they must be staying together.

387
00:22:48,797 --> 00:22:49,478
Hopefully, they are all right.

388
00:23:06,157 --> 00:23:07,238
Why did the sandstorm come all of sudden?

389
00:23:07,878 --> 00:23:09,238
It doesn't feel like a normal sandstorm.

390
00:23:09,797 --> 00:23:10,878
Is it caused by the Sand Beast?

391
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:12,397
Who provokes the Sand Beast?

392
00:23:12,478 --> 00:23:13,157
I don't know.

393
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,358
Are you all right?

394
00:23:15,758 --> 00:23:17,638
I'm fine. Luckily, you protected me.

395
00:23:20,878 --> 00:23:21,677
How about you?

396
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:23,638
I'm fine. We are lucky.

397
00:23:25,598 --> 00:23:27,358
Hold on. It is dirty.

398
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:31,197
I'll draw a rabbit for you.

399
00:23:32,598 --> 00:23:33,238
Where is Master?

400
00:23:34,878 --> 00:23:36,397
We were separated by the sandstorm.

401
00:23:36,598 --> 00:23:38,118
Headmaster and the others
must have experienced the same.

402
00:23:38,118 --> 00:23:38,758
Let's go and look for them.

403
00:23:39,157 --> 00:23:40,677
Xi Si City is so large.
Where should we start?

404
00:23:41,677 --> 00:23:43,118
The sandstorm blows from
the outside of the city.

405
00:23:43,118 --> 00:23:44,077
I guess they ran back.

406
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:45,437
We can look for them along the way we came.

407
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:51,917
The Sand Beast is looking for its mate.

408
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:53,437
You can understand that?

409
00:23:53,838 --> 00:23:55,397
I can feel its mood.

410
00:23:56,598 --> 00:23:58,118
Is this sandstorm caused by it?

411
00:23:58,677 --> 00:23:59,358
I think so.

412
00:24:00,317 --> 00:24:01,677
Never mind. It's more important to find them now.

413
00:24:12,277 --> 00:24:13,197
It seems to be Hu Lie Na!

414
00:24:32,998 --> 00:24:34,797
She will die
if she knocks on the wall.

415
00:24:39,998 --> 00:24:41,557
Hold on tightly. I will rush into it.

416
00:24:42,118 --> 00:24:43,397
You want to rush into the storm and save her?

417
00:24:43,838 --> 00:24:44,797
What if you are swept away?

418
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:45,718
But I have to rescue her.

419
00:24:47,157 --> 00:24:48,317
What about I teleport into the storm

420
00:24:48,358 --> 00:24:49,037
and rescue her?

421
00:24:53,478 --> 00:24:54,917
No, it's too risky, Wu.

422
00:24:55,238 --> 00:24:56,317
Keep in mind, if the storm is too strong,

423
00:24:56,397 --> 00:24:57,157
let go of your grasp.

424
00:25:13,358 --> 00:25:14,238
It's now.

425
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:57,437
Wu, let go of your grasp!

426
00:25:58,397 --> 00:25:59,317
I won't let go!

427
00:26:29,598 --> 00:26:30,557
It was really scary!

428
00:26:30,758 --> 00:26:31,677
Why didn't you let go of your grasp?

429
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,157
I will be wherever you are.

430
00:26:33,238 --> 00:26:33,797
You...

431
00:26:35,077 --> 00:26:35,797
She is awake.

432
00:26:38,557 --> 00:26:39,758
You rescued me again.

433
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:42,758
Where are the others?

434
00:26:44,077 --> 00:26:44,758
I don't know.

435
00:26:46,518 --> 00:26:47,157
Are you all right?

436
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:50,797
When the sandstorm came,

437
00:26:51,118 --> 00:26:53,157
I was stunned. I'm fine now.

438
00:26:53,358 --> 00:26:54,638
We're going to look for them

439
00:26:54,638 --> 00:26:55,197
along the way back.

440
00:26:55,797 --> 00:26:56,197
Tang San!

441
00:26:58,557 --> 00:26:59,998
You saved me once

442
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:01,277
when Dai Mu Bai's brother appeared.

443
00:27:09,638 --> 00:27:10,518
This is the second time.

444
00:27:11,638 --> 00:27:12,277
I've forgotten it.

445
00:27:12,878 --> 00:27:13,758
I remember it.

446
00:27:14,557 --> 00:27:15,397
I'll repay your kindness.

447
00:27:15,797 --> 00:27:17,037
No need. Let's go.

448
00:27:46,118 --> 00:27:48,118
Is anybody here? We are the guests of the inn.

449
00:27:51,437 --> 00:27:52,317
Hurry! Get in.

450
00:27:55,638 --> 00:27:56,238
Are you all right?

451
00:27:58,317 --> 00:28:00,157
Boss, did anyone come?

452
00:28:00,797 --> 00:28:01,677
The sandstorm is here.

453
00:28:01,917 --> 00:28:03,277
No one would come and stay.

454
00:28:03,277 --> 00:28:05,037
I mean my friends

455
00:28:05,157 --> 00:28:05,917
and the two teachers.

456
00:28:06,197 --> 00:28:07,118
We stayed here previously.

457
00:28:07,317 --> 00:28:08,718
No. No one came here.

458
00:28:09,677 --> 00:28:10,838
Headmaster and the others
didn't come here.

459
00:28:11,197 --> 00:28:12,197
I have to go out and look for them.

460
00:28:13,157 --> 00:28:13,797
Don't go out.

461
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:15,838
The Sand Beast is still out there.

462
00:28:16,118 --> 00:28:16,838
Sand Beast?

463
00:28:17,077 --> 00:28:17,638
Yes.

464
00:28:17,917 --> 00:28:19,677
Can't you hear the cry of the Sand Beast?

465
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:21,838
This sandstorm is
caused by the Sand Beast.

466
00:28:22,157 --> 00:28:23,758
But why does the Sand Beast cause the sandstorm?

467
00:28:24,358 --> 00:28:25,358
How can I know that?

468
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:28,037
There must be someone
who provokes the Sand Beast.

469
00:28:28,677 --> 00:28:29,677
I have to go out and figure it out.

470
00:28:29,838 --> 00:28:30,677
You don't want to live?

471
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:33,118
You stay here. If anyone comes here,

472
00:28:33,397 --> 00:28:34,397
ask them to stay inside

473
00:28:34,397 --> 00:28:35,238
and wait for my return.

474
00:28:35,518 --> 00:28:36,718
Your own life is the most important.

475
00:28:36,838 --> 00:28:38,317
It's unnecessary to risk your life for others.

476
00:28:38,838 --> 00:28:39,677
If I had thought it that way,

477
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:41,157
you would have died already.

478
00:28:43,677 --> 00:28:44,638
Don't leave now.

479
00:28:46,397 --> 00:28:47,638
You are the Crown Prince's...

480
00:28:48,037 --> 00:28:49,677
Messenger, Ma Xiu Nuo.

481
00:28:50,118 --> 00:28:50,478
Okay.

482
00:28:50,998 --> 00:28:51,598
Hold on.

483
00:28:52,277 --> 00:28:52,917
Anything?

484
00:28:53,277 --> 00:28:54,157
Can you send me off the city?

485
00:28:54,718 --> 00:28:55,797
I can pay you.

486
00:28:56,118 --> 00:28:56,998
I'm going to rescue my companions.

487
00:28:57,197 --> 00:28:58,037
It's very safe here.

488
00:28:58,077 --> 00:28:58,958
You can just stay here.

489
00:28:59,797 --> 00:29:00,518
Please come inside.

490
00:29:00,797 --> 00:29:01,797
It's a very important matter.

491
00:29:01,797 --> 00:29:02,598
What is the important matter?

492
00:29:02,718 --> 00:29:03,638
Come in and you'll know.

493
00:29:12,157 --> 00:29:12,557
Hurry up.

494
00:29:12,557 --> 00:29:13,437
What are you doing?

495
00:29:14,598 --> 00:29:15,317
Come in and see this.

496
00:29:15,317 --> 00:29:15,998
I'm in a hurry to look for my friends.

497
00:29:21,638 --> 00:29:22,277
Who?

498
00:29:32,598 --> 00:29:34,118
They said the sandstorm
was caused by the Sand Beast.

499
00:29:34,797 --> 00:29:35,917
Could it be this one?

500
00:29:36,718 --> 00:29:38,157
The Sand Beast crying out there

501
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:39,598
is looking for its mate.

502
00:29:39,758 --> 00:29:40,917
Maybe it's looking for this one.

503
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:44,437
But why is it here?

504
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,238
I saw it at the night market last night.

505
00:29:47,397 --> 00:29:48,358
It was playing alone.

506
00:29:48,797 --> 00:29:50,118
I thought it was an abandoned pet.

507
00:29:51,157 --> 00:29:52,598
Then I caught it and wanted to give it to others.

508
00:29:53,397 --> 00:29:55,718
When I woke up this morning, the sandstorm came.

509
00:29:56,118 --> 00:29:57,557
You dared to do this to the Sand Beast?

510
00:29:58,557 --> 00:29:59,998
I didn't know it's a Sand Beast.

511
00:30:00,317 --> 00:30:02,118
Otherwise, I wouldn't dare to do this.

512
00:30:02,838 --> 00:30:04,277
Take it out now and set it free.

513
00:30:06,358 --> 00:30:08,797
You can help me to get out of the city,

514
00:30:09,197 --> 00:30:10,758
and we secretly set it free outside of the city.

515
00:30:11,118 --> 00:30:11,917
Then we will be all right.

516
00:30:11,998 --> 00:30:13,277
You won't be able to leave here with it beside you.

517
00:30:13,718 --> 00:30:15,157
There's a Sand Beast outside.

518
00:30:15,277 --> 00:30:16,037
What could we do then?

519
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:20,077
Take it and this guy out to the street.

520
00:30:20,478 --> 00:30:22,917
When the Sand Beast
finds its mate and also the culprit,

521
00:30:23,077 --> 00:30:24,437
the sandstorm will probably stop.

522
00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:25,397
Then I'm doomed.

523
00:30:26,238 --> 00:30:27,878
You should bear the consequences.

524
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:28,758
Enough.

525
00:30:29,238 --> 00:30:30,518
She just wanted to scare you. Don't worry.

526
00:30:30,838 --> 00:30:31,718
I didn't scare him.

527
00:30:33,557 --> 00:30:35,118
Send this young beast to the street.

528
00:30:35,557 --> 00:30:36,838
Don't let other Sand Beasts discover it.

529
00:30:37,998 --> 00:30:38,478
Right.

530
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:40,358
Tang San, are you here?

531
00:30:42,638 --> 00:30:43,197
Wang Sheng?

532
00:30:47,557 --> 00:30:48,077
Wang Sheng.

533
00:30:48,838 --> 00:30:49,718
It's great that you're here.

534
00:30:50,277 --> 00:30:51,358
We encountered the sandstorm

535
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:52,277
on the way.

536
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:53,718
Otherwise, we'd have arrived earlier.

537
00:30:56,317 --> 00:30:57,118
What's the matter?

538
00:30:57,998 --> 00:30:59,317
The captain is asking for your whereabouts.

539
00:31:00,157 --> 00:31:01,598
Let me introduce to you

540
00:31:02,157 --> 00:31:04,598
the captain of the Fiend Battle Team,

541
00:31:05,718 --> 00:31:06,478
Meng Li.

542
00:31:15,437 --> 00:31:16,277
They are all your friends?

543
00:31:18,397 --> 00:31:19,077
More or less.

544
00:31:19,397 --> 00:31:20,718
Since all of you are Soul Masters,
you can work together.

545
00:31:21,478 --> 00:31:22,437
All of you are Soul Masters, right?

546
00:31:23,397 --> 00:31:24,838
I'm Ma Xiu Nuo from Tian Dou City.

547
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:26,317
I hire you to send me off the city.

548
00:31:26,437 --> 00:31:27,277
You can tell the price as you wish.

549
00:31:27,718 --> 00:31:30,838
Tian Dou City. Let us tell the price?

550
00:31:32,277 --> 00:31:34,238
Yes. No matter how many
Gold Soul Coins you want.

551
00:31:35,037 --> 00:31:37,437
So generous. You come from the royal family?

552
00:31:37,518 --> 00:31:39,238
You're right. My dad is an officer in the palace.

553
00:31:39,518 --> 00:31:40,437
You can believe me.

554
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:48,238
Does the royal family even need to hire us?

555
00:31:51,437 --> 00:31:52,118
Why are you laughing?

556
00:31:58,917 --> 00:31:59,998
The sandstorm is still raging.

557
00:32:00,317 --> 00:32:01,718
Should we engage in an internal conflict
at this point?

558
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:10,838
All of them have Quadruple Soul Rings.

559
00:32:11,397 --> 00:32:12,598
The team is really strong.

560
00:32:13,037 --> 00:32:15,718
He's from the royal family.
So this is not an internal conflict!

561
00:32:22,157 --> 00:32:23,397
I'm not sure if I've offended you.

562
00:32:23,917 --> 00:32:25,598
Kill him.

563
00:32:25,998 --> 00:32:27,557
Stop! I can stop the sandstorm.

564
00:32:46,118 --> 00:32:47,157
You've made the right decision not to leave.

565
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:48,397
Later,

566
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:49,518
hold on longer in the battle,

567
00:32:50,077 --> 00:32:50,917
and you will pass the test.

568
00:32:51,157 --> 00:32:53,157
Then we will be on the same team.

569
00:32:54,478 --> 00:32:55,478
You're looking for me.

570
00:32:55,998 --> 00:32:57,077
What does it have to do with him?

571
00:32:57,718 --> 00:32:58,518
The captain gave the order

572
00:32:58,797 --> 00:32:59,677
to kill him.

573
00:33:01,157 --> 00:33:02,437
That's too extreme, Wang Sheng.

574
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:03,998
Keep your voice down or you will die.

575
00:33:11,277 --> 00:33:12,397
Look at this.

576
00:33:13,238 --> 00:33:14,998
He caught the young beast

577
00:33:15,718 --> 00:33:16,838
and caused its mother to get mad,

578
00:33:17,598 --> 00:33:19,077
which in turn caused this sandstorm.

579
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:20,437
He is

580
00:33:21,037 --> 00:33:22,557
the culprit who caused this disaster.

581
00:33:23,277 --> 00:33:24,238
I've said

582
00:33:25,718 --> 00:33:27,197
that those from the royal family

583
00:33:28,197 --> 00:33:29,157
don't come with a good intention.

584
00:33:29,557 --> 00:33:30,397
This is the evidence.

585
00:33:31,277 --> 00:33:32,358
I didn't intend to do that.

586
00:33:33,437 --> 00:33:34,478
This is my first time coming to Xi Si City.

587
00:33:35,157 --> 00:33:36,518
I don't know about Sand Beasts.

588
00:33:37,197 --> 00:33:38,677
This is your deliberate arrangement.

589
00:33:38,998 --> 00:33:41,077
You wish to destroy
the whole Xi Si City with the sandstorm.

590
00:33:42,157 --> 00:33:44,518
I don't have the intention.
If I had really wanted to do so,

591
00:33:45,037 --> 00:33:46,557
I wouldn't have stayed here.

592
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:50,157
I'll give you a chance now.

593
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:51,118
Say it.

594
00:33:52,077 --> 00:33:54,118
Bring it out of the yard

595
00:33:54,677 --> 00:33:56,878
and find its mate
to let the sandstorm recede.

596
00:33:57,238 --> 00:33:57,998
Even if I can find it,

597
00:33:58,958 --> 00:33:59,958
I will die

598
00:34:00,598 --> 00:34:01,557
once the Sand Beast gets crazy.

599
00:34:02,197 --> 00:34:04,518
Otherwise, you will die now!

600
00:34:07,797 --> 00:34:08,838
Maybe it can go out by itself

601
00:34:09,518 --> 00:34:10,557
without my assistance.

602
00:34:10,638 --> 00:34:11,397
You can't understand human words?

603
00:34:12,118 --> 00:34:12,838
There are two options. Pick one!

604
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:14,718
You bring it out on your own

605
00:34:15,117 --> 00:34:16,597
or die now.

606
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:20,357
I'll go for him.

607
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:27,117
Are you close to him?

608
00:34:27,318 --> 00:34:28,357
Why do you want to die for him?

609
00:34:28,998 --> 00:34:29,877
I heard from Wang Sheng

610
00:34:30,437 --> 00:34:31,278
that you are his friend.

611
00:34:32,478 --> 00:34:34,597
Yes, we're from the same school.

612
00:34:34,917 --> 00:34:36,357
Then why do you help an outsider?

613
00:34:37,078 --> 00:34:38,278
The Sand Beast has gone mad.

614
00:34:39,157 --> 00:34:40,798
If I don't help him, the situation will get worse.

615
00:34:41,357 --> 00:34:42,397
It's his own mistake,

616
00:34:43,197 --> 00:34:44,917
so he has to bear with it.

617
00:34:46,078 --> 00:34:46,958
He is too timid.

618
00:34:48,917 --> 00:34:50,558
You mean you are brave enough?

619
00:34:51,397 --> 00:34:52,798
Someone must do it.

620
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:54,558
I'm more suitable than him.

621
00:34:55,197 --> 00:34:55,758
Moreover,

622
00:34:56,437 --> 00:34:57,478
if the sandstorm keeps going on,

623
00:34:58,397 --> 00:34:59,437
it'll be dangerous for you too.

624
00:35:03,278 --> 00:35:03,758
All right.

625
00:35:09,478 --> 00:35:09,917
I...

626
00:35:17,637 --> 00:35:18,718
I can go on my own.

627
00:35:22,837 --> 00:35:24,478
Okay, then you have to listen to me.

628
00:35:37,478 --> 00:35:38,637
Aren't you their companion?

629
00:35:39,078 --> 00:35:39,798
Why don't you go with them?

630
00:35:40,798 --> 00:35:42,038
Aren't you an old friend of theirs?

631
00:35:42,397 --> 00:35:43,238
Why don't you go with them?
