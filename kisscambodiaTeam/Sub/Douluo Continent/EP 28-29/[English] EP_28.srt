14
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,399
What about you?

15
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,639
I'm just going to die.

16
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,200
I thought you would give it a try.

17
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:51,800
Well.

18
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,319
You saved my granddaughter,

19
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,719
and I'm indebted to you.

20
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,279
You don't have to risk your life.

21
00:01:57,999 --> 00:01:58,959
That means

22
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:00,639
I've done whatever I should?

23
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,560
Yes, you have.

24
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:04,560
All right. Fulfill your promise.

25
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,319
Two thousand Gold Soul Coins.

26
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,679
I don't have the money.

27
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,959
As I live here,

28
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,399
whatever I eat and use,

29
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,999
it's sent by the royal family.

30
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,999
I don't have money.

31
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,240
Then why did you promise me?

32
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,400
I wanted to save Yan Yan at that time,

33
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,639
so I just made a promise.

34
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:22,520
Then...

35
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:23,919
All right.

36
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,160
The second condition.

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Help me find the Grand Soul Land Master

38
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,240
behind Cang Hui School.

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,839
You mean...

40
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:33,600
You suspected that Shi Nian
who is in the Mind Branch

41
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:35,440
has controlled Hao Tian Soul Master?

42
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,240
That's right.

43
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:36,960
No way.

44
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,119
What do you mean?

45
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,800
A Grand Soul Land Master

46
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:41,999
is someone

47
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,520
who sees through
the nature of Martial Soul.

48
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,520
Unless

49
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:48,160
they meet someone who is in the Mind Branch
with Nine Soul Rings.

50
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,080
Otherwise,

51
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:50,960
they couldn't be controlled.

52
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:52,719
So, if Hao Tian Soul Master

53
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,359
really stands behind Cang Hui School,

54
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,440
he won't be affected by the Mind Branch.

55
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,600
You're right.

56
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,680
Then why didn't you mention it

57
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,400
when you promised me?

58
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:03,800
I was eager to save someone.

59
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,999
I just made a promise.

60
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:06,160
So...

61
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,359
You didn't keep either of your promises.

62
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,400
No matter what,

63
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,919
it's still a good ending.

64
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:13,400
You...

65
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,800
As a Grand Soul Land Master

66
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,119
with Nine Soul Rings,

67
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,759
you can't even keep your promises.

68
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,680
What promise?

69
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,999
I've been staying in this cave

70
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:27,040
and have rarely talked to people,

71
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,160
how could I know about

72
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,960
keeping promises?

73
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,440
I only know how to make poison here.

74
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:30,719
You...

75
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:36,919
What's wrong?

76
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,639
Let's go, Wu.

77
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,279
Let's go back to the school.

78
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,199
Wait.

79
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,759
Now what?

80
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,600
I can't give you 2,000 Gold Soul Coins.

81
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,800
But I have another way

82
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,680
to repay you.

83
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,880
It depends

84
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,639
on how capable you are.

85
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,080
A valley within a mountain?

86
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,639
Initially, this was

87
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:03,960
also a mountain.

88
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,279
Then how did this valley

89
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,199
take shape?

90
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,199
Many years ago,

91
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,960
a Grand Soul Land Master
with Nine Soul Rings

92
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,719
fought a battle

93
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:14,719
with Martial Soul Hall here.

94
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,839
Someone crushed the peak

95
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,719
and made this valley.

96
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,960
Such a big valley

97
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:22,999
was left by the battle?

98
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,439
How powerful were the Soul Masters fighting?

99
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,439
The Grand Soul Land Master
with Nine Soul Rings.

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,879
There was more than one.

101
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,800
Who were they?

102
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,439
I have no idea.

103
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,919
At that time,

104
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,400
I only had Seven Soul Rings.

105
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,280
I only dared to come closer

106
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,199
long after the battle had ended.

107
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,240
When I came here,

108
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,439
I realised

109
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,919
that many herbs were growing here.

110
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,960
Either for making poison or for curing it,

111
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:50,280
the herbs were quite precious.

112
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,159
So, I decided to stay here

113
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,439
to pursue my studies.

114
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,759
Finally, I've got Nine Soul Rings.

115
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:57,919
Then...

116
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,039
What does it have to do with the payment?

117
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:02,000
Brother, look.

118
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,599
There are so many herbs.

119
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,520
So, these herbs are the payment?

120
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:10,000
Then how many should we pluck

121
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,159
to make up 2,000 Gold Soul Coins?

122
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,120
I don't sell herbs.

123
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,359
How can I know?

124
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,000
You...

125
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:16,319
Brother, forget it.
Since we're already here,

126
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:17,720
let's just pluck some.

127
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,199
Actually, there is a barrier.

128
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,720
Behind it,

129
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:35,919
there is

130
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,599
a space that I cannot enter.

131
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,520
The space behind it

132
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,319
might have something more precious

133
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:44,359
than the herbs you see here.

134
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,039
There might be some unknown danger,

135
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,840
or nothing at all.

136
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,039
It feels cool.

137
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,720
There might really be something inside.

138
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,080
But why don't you enter?

139
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,879
I've tried many times,

140
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,639
but still fail to enter it.

141
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,720
Can't enter it?

142
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:14,759
(Tang San.)

143
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,800
(Use your Blue Silver Plant.)

144
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,879
Even I with Nine Soul Rings can't enter it.

145
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,280
I think you two...

146
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,439
They just entered it?

147
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:00,599
This...

148
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,759
How did we reach here suddenly?

149
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,520
This is...

150
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,319
Rare Powerful Chrysanthemum?

151
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:21,800
Is this a herb?

152
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,240
This isn't just a normal herb.

153
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:24,400
It's a premium herb.

154
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:25,680
Premium?

155
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,039
A magical herb that contains Soul Power.

156
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:33,720
Wait, this is...

157
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,960
Eight Petal Fairy Orchid?

158
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,800
Why are these all premium herbs?

159
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
What kind of place is this?

160
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,000
I have no idea, either.

161
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,599
I only remember that I was feeling dizzy

162
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,359
and then I got here.

163
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,919
It's so beautiful.

164
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:18,000
I have been here

165
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,159
in my dream.

166
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,319
Dream?

167
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:22,879
In your dream,

168
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,759
does this shining circle exist too?

169
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,319
Yes.

170
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:28,599
Ever since childhood, I've been
having the same dream.

171
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,120
I dreamt of this place.

172
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,319
And then?

173
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,039
There was a woman's voice

174
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,159
calling my name in the dream.

175
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,039
Woman's voice?

176
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,920
I didn't hear it.

177
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,160
I can't believe
this place actually exists.

178
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,080
But why did I dream of this place?

179
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,199
It sounds so magical.

180
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,439
Did the Blue Silver Plant in your dream

181
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,439
shine too?

182
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,759
It didn't.

183
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:55,319
But the surroundings looked just the same.

184
00:08:57,999 --> 00:09:00,360
Maybe, this light is the key.

185
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,080
Wu, we're up in the air now.

186
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:30,280
Wu, are you all right?

187
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:33,879
Finally you're here, Tang San.

188
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:35,439
(This is the voice in my dream.)

189
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,559
Who are you?

190
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,480
I'm your mother.

191
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,960
I know you have questions,

192
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,239
but I can't hear them.

193
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:47,040
I don't believe it.

194
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,040
My dad has never told me anything

195
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,160
about my mother.

196
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,720
I don't believe you.

197
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:53,360
Wu, let's go.

198
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:55,480
Before I passed away,

199
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,199
I hid the power of Blue Silver Plant

200
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,400
in your heart.

201
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,799
That's why you dreamt of this place.

202
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,999
Don't lie to me.

203
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:07,119
Don't lie to me with this matter!

204
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,040
On the day of your birth,

205
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:11,720
when I was hugging you,

206
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,799
you were so tiny and soft.

207
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,239
I brought you to this world,

208
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,040
but I didn't fulfill my responsibility
as a mother.

209
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,160
I didn't get the chance

210
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,199
to hug you more

211
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,720
or watch you growing up.

212
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,040
That's my greatest regret.

213
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,520
I'll never

214
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,720
forgive myself.

215
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:36,040
Son,

216
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:37,879
I'm sorry.

217
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:41,160
I owe you a lot.

218
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,480
How old are you now?

219
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:45,160
Have you grown up?

220
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,679
I told your father

221
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:50,879
to hide everything about me.

222
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,319
If you don't become a Soul Master,

223
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,840
if you don't practice the Xuan Tian Records,

224
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,400
then you won't be here

225
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,239
and hear what I've just said.

226
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,439
You'll live your life

227
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,879
in peace.

228
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,040
Isn't that good too?

229
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:13,160
Since you're here,

230
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:14,879
it proves

231
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,239
that you have potential.

232
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:19,239
You're my hope.

233
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,439
I don't get it.

234
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,520
I left the Xuan Tian Records to you.

235
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:27,720
My death

236
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,280
was related to it.

237
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,119
The day when you were born,

238
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:35,639
Chief Qian Xun Ji

239
00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:37,999
led the other Soul Masters
from Martial Soul Hall

240
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:39,559
to kill me.

241
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,239
There were two reasons.

242
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,840
One, my real identity.

243
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,759
You don't need to know for now.

244
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,119
When you're ready,

245
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,559
your dad will tell you.

246
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:54,720
The second reason

247
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:56,999
was the Xuan Tian Records.

248
00:11:58,119 --> 00:11:59,920
For a thousand years in Douluo Continent,

249
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,280
the Soul Master system has been so strong

250
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,439
that Soul Masters and Souls Beasts

251
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:05,520
are irreconcilable.

252
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,920
They will go to war one day.

253
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,600
Xuan Tian Records

254
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,199
could be another way of training.

255
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:16,119
It's another type of power

256
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:17,199
that no longer requires Martial Soul.

257
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:18,960
Replacing the Soul Masters?

258
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,280
If it really succeeds,

259
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:24,319
then Soul Masters will be in the past,

260
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:26,119
and Martial Soul Hall

261
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,160
will vanish too.

262
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,480
So Chief Qian Xun Ji of Martial Soul Hall

263
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:33,600
wouldn't spare me.

264
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:35,559
Unfortunately,

265
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,720
Your dad and I

266
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,239
failed to learn

267
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:40,920
the Xuan Tian Records.

268
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:42,639
So we suspected

269
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,559
that someone has to master the Xuan Tian Records

270
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:46,879
and use it as the base,

271
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,960
and then train their Soul Skills

272
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,360
and become a Soul Master.

273
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,199
Only then can he fully utilise

274
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,080
the power of the Xuan Tian Records.

275
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:54,879
So,

276
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,040
since you're here,

277
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,600
it proves

278
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,879
that this is the right way.

279
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:02,400
Telling you the truth

280
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,600
doesn't mean I want you to take revenge.

281
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,679
It's just the opposite.

282
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,639
I hope you won't have hatred

283
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,879
in your heart.

284
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:13,119
You have your own mission and future.

285
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,160
Don't let hatred

286
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:16,520
blind you

287
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,160
and ruin your life.

288
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:21,559
My only wish

289
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,360
is that you can live well,

290
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:28,239
and advance your Soul Skills

291
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,160
and your practice of the Xuan Tian Records
to the greatest extent.

292
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,239
And then find a way

293
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,360
that Soul Masters won't
depend on Martial Souls anymore.

294
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,799
The future of Douluo Continent

295
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,879
lies in your hand.

296
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:40,400
Unfortunately,

297
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:43,360
I won't be able to witness it.

298
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,360
Tang San.

299
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,799
I gave you your name.

300
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,400
Three give birth to everything.

301
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,639
It's simple yet hopeful.

302
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,439
At the same time, I was a bit selfish.

303
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:57,280
Your dad, you, and I,

304
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,319
the three of us would make a family.

305
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,160
When you were born,

306
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,679
it was the happiest moment in my life.

307
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,160
Your dad and I

308
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:10,239
would have a meaning in our lives from then on.

309
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,439
I have almost a thousand,

310
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:14,239
or even ten thousand things to tell you.

311
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:16,920
I wish to give you everything.

312
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,439
But my path

313
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:21,080
has come to an end.

314
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,040
I'm sorry, my son.

315
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,080
I'm sorry.

316
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,759
In this interspace that I've created,

317
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,840
I've left some herbs for you.

318
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:36,840
I guess you must have seen them

319
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,160
on your way here.

320
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:41,639
Maybe these herbs

321
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:42,759
can help you in the future.

322
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:43,879
Also,

323
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,720
this divine herb above the premium

324
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,920
and Ice Fire Mouth Spring

325
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:51,119
are my real gifts for you.

326
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,119
This is Lovesick Heartbroken Scarlet.

327
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,319
This flower feeds on love,

328
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,720
and is extremely useful.

329
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:03,559
Before I died,

330
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,400
I had hidden all my Soul Power

331
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,520
in this flower.

332
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:10,080
I hope it can help you become powerful.

333
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,559
Live well.

334
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:14,879
This is Ice Fire Mouth Spring.

335
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,920
It can help you to absorb

336
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,520
the Soul Beast that is
beyond your capacity.

337
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:22,400
Actually, I want to give you

338
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,679
my company

339
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:26,840
and the warmth of a family.

340
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:29,720
But I can't do it.

341
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,999
These gifts, this power,

342
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:35,439
I hope they can protect you.

343
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,239
Mom, I don't want anything.

344
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:43,679
I just want you to come back!

345
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,799
I don't want anything else.

346
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:49,080
I used up my last power

347
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,840
to create this interspace.

348
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:53,920
Apart from you,

349
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,679
no one can enter here.

350
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,559
Not even your father.

351
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,840
I couldn't imagine

352
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,040
how strong his hatred

353
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,160
towards Martial Soul Hall would be

354
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,920
after my death.

355
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,280
I hope you can accompany him.

356
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,239
Don't let him fall into the abyss of revenge

357
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:14,999
or lose his humanity.

358
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:17,559
Cang Hui School.

359
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:20,119
Revenge on Martial Soul Hall.

360
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:20,999
Son,

361
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:23,720
there's something I must tell you.

362
00:16:24,439 --> 00:16:25,639
You're my most beloved one

363
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,840
in this world.

364
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,160
You must be healthy and happy.

365
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,360
Learn to be kind.

366
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,439
Don't be afraid of hardship.

367
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,040
My heart

368
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,879
will always be with you.

369
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,600
Tang San.

370
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,639
I really wish to see you.

371
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,920
Goodbye.

372
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,799
No! Mom!

373
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,920
I'm here.

374
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,920
Mom!

375
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,760
He saved my life?

376
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,240
Then how should I repay his kindness?

377
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:19,919
I brought the two of them

378
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:21,760
to the Dream Valley.

379
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:22,960
I didn't expect

380
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,360
they would really enter it

381
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:25,360
to look for treasures within.

382
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:26,840
Impossible.

383
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,640
We've tried so many times

384
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,319
and we still failed to enter.

385
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,840
Yes, I'm curious too.

386
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,880
Clearly, you've locked them up.

387
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,399
They are my saviours!

388
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,799
How is that possible?

389
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,000
Why should I lock them up?

390
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,240
I wasn't lying.

391
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,840
Find them back.

392
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:47,240
I can't do anything

393
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:48,360
if they don't come out.

394
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,319
Since your poison is cured now,

395
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,360
it doesn't matter

396
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,199
if they are coming back or not.

397
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:55,199
Besides, I'm not close to them.

398
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,039
But they are my friends!

399
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,199
Just find new ones.

400
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,559
Actually,

401
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:04,679
we're not merely friends.

402
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,640
We treat each other like old friends

403
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:09,519
and are considering getting married.

404
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,000
What?

405
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,679
Maybe...

406
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,199
Maybe he'll become your grandson-in-law.

407
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,439
If you don't find him,

408
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,199
I can't live anymore!

409
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,319
This...

410
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:23,080
That brat.

411
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,640
Don't cry.

412
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,080
Don't cry. I'll look for him.

413
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,039
Don't cry. I'll look for him.

414
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,120
I think I fell asleep.

415
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,000
This spring looks magical.

416
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,039
When did it appear?

417
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,480
Brother.

418
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,600
What happened?

419
00:18:58,199 --> 00:18:58,840
Are you all right?

420
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,039
This is my mom.

421
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:07,640
You mean the voice in your dream?

422
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,000
She left this place

423
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,679
for me.

424
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,279
The voice in my dream,

425
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,559
it was her calling me.

426
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:22,480
Now I know.

427
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,799
She has been guiding me to this place.

428
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,720
Guiding you here?

429
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,720
Did you see her?

430
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:35,080
She's gone.

431
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,240
Wu,

432
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,519
do you know?

433
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:45,120
Ever since young,

434
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:47,960
other kids have been accompanied
by their mothers.

435
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,919
Except me.

436
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,120
That's why I really wish...

437
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:53,960
No.

438
00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:57,159
I was very much eager

439
00:19:57,159 --> 00:19:58,439
to know things about my mom.

440
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,799
But all this time,

441
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,120
my dad hasn't told me anything.

442
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,360
In order to know

443
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,240
my mom's Martial Soul,

444
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,919
I purposely went
to the Martial Soul Awakening Rite.

445
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:11,399
When I knew that I have Twin Martial Souls,

446
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,279
that I'm so lucky to have inherited

447
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,880
both my parents' Martial Souls,

448
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:18,360
I knew I have to work harder.

449
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,159
Having undergone extreme hardships,

450
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,279
no matter how difficult it is,
I'll never give up.

451
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,760
Because I remember

452
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,159
what my dad told me.

453
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,360
Remember, in the future,

454
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,279
to use the Hammer on your left hand

455
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,720
to protect the Plant on your right hand.

456
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,360
Always.

457
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,840
I have to be like my dad

458
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:42,679
and always protect my mom.

459
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:45,919
Brother.

460
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,360
Actually, our looks

461
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:49,640
are the combination of our parents.

462
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:51,880
So, you somehow look

463
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:53,399
like your mom.

464
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:55,960
I'll show you if you don't believe it.

465
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,399
Look.

466
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,319
Over here.

467
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,080
You look like Uncle Tang.

468
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,159
So,

469
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,159
here!

470
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,720
It should look like your mom.

471
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:15,600
Let's go out in a while.

472
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,199
Your Martial Soul is gone too.

473
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,799
We should hurry and think of a way.

474
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,720
It's strange.

475
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:26,480
After I woke up,

476
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,319
I can feel the Soul Power
running within my body.

477
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:30,159
Not only my Martial Soul has been recovered,

478
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,159
but my Soul Power is also full.

479
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,279
I feel like

480
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,960
I can advance to Quadruple Soul Rings.

481
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,679
My Soul Power is full too.

482
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,159
I'm ready to advance.

483
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,319
How did that happen?

484
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,240
Probably Lovesick Heartbroken Scarlet

485
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:47,519
transferred the Soul Power to you.

486
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,039
This is...

487
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:57,159
It's a premium herb.

488
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,559
My mom left her Soul Power

489
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:01,159
in it.

490
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,439
Then why did she give it to me?

491
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:05,279
That's great.

492
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:08,080
As long as you can recover, it's great.

493
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,840
It's strange. I feel

494
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:12,480
that I'm connected to this flower.

495
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:14,519
As though

496
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:16,080
it's protecting me.

497
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,919
This spring

498
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,799
is called Ice Fire Mouth Spring.

499
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,080
It's my mom's gift as well.

500
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:32,519
Ice Fire Mouth Spring?

501
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,840
The magical spring in the legend?

502
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,279
I heard that it can help
Soul Masters to absorb

503
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:39,799
Soul Rings beyond their limits.

504
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,319
But I also heard

505
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,880
that after the spring is absorbed,

506
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,840
it'll disappear.

507
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,760
So I only have one chance?

508
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,240
Yes.

509
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,480
This was formed by my mom's energy.

510
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:56,480
I can't bear to absorb it.

511
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,279
Oh, right.

512
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,559
This flower,

513
00:23:02,439 --> 00:23:03,039
you should keep it.

514
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,199
You're the first person who touched it.

515
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,760
This flower will be just like me,

516
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,199
accompanying you forever.

517
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,880
Let's stay for a while before we leave.

518
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:15,039
Before we go,

519
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,199
remember to grab some premium herbs.

520
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,760
Brother,

521
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:30,039
how do we get out now?

522
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:35,679
Hold my hand.

523
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:52,720
We're back.

524
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,000
You're poisoned?

525
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,640
Both of you finally came out?

526
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,080
What's inside?

527
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:07,840
Nothing much.

528
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,080
Fine.

529
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,960
Follow me back

530
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,679
and discuss your marriage.

531
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,240
Go!

532
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,559
Marriage?

533
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
I was just joking around.

534
00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:19,039
How could you joke about that?

535
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,640
Because he saved my life!

536
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:22,600
What does it have to do with this?

537
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,159
I know you well.

538
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:25,439
If I hadn't said so,

539
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,000
would you have gone out and looked for him?

540
00:24:28,439 --> 00:24:29,480
You little girl.

541
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,319
But, he's quite cute.

542
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,640
Sounds good if we really get married.

543
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,080
Are you being serious this time?

544
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,840
I'm serious! How about

545
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,760
I prove it to you?

546
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,159
How?

547
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,360
I'll kiss him.

548
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:50,159
No way!

549
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:52,360
Why not?

550
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:57,519
I was just joking.

551
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:03,319
Don't be holding the herbs.

552
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:04,880
Here, put them in the box.

553
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:09,480
There is someone I like.

554
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,960
I won't take Tang San away from you.

555
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,880
Who do you like?

556
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,399
What will you do after I tell you about it?

557
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,760
Catch him back to marry you.

558
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,080
Then I surely won't tell you.

559
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:24,519
Why would I have

560
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,439
such a disobedient granddaughter like you?

561
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:26,439
I learnt that from you!

562
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,039
What are you looking at?
Hurry and go back.

563
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:33,279
Go.

564
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:34,480
Senior.

565
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:37,279
I want to make a deal with you again.

566
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:38,960
I'll cure your poison,

567
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:41,199
and you help our school
to get into the final.

568
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,039
Cure my poison?

569
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:43,799
How?

570
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,919
I only need this Octa Dark Frost.

571
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,399
Where did you get it?

572
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,480
The interspace.

573
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,559
You just came

574
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,960
and easily found

575
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,799
the interspace.

576
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,120
You even

577
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,679
got so many premium herbs.

578
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,360
What's the use of this herb?

579
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:03,199
Don't touch!

580
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:03,600
Don't touch!

581
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:04,640
What's wrong?

582
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,679
It's the most poisonous herb.

583
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:09,600
What are you going to do with it?

584
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,319
Cure your grandfather's poison.

585
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,840
Isn't this the most poisonous herb?

586
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:16,240
Octa Dark Frost

587
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:18,039
can gather all the poisons

588
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,000
in the body,

589
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:20,640
and unleash

590
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,240
its own poison.

591
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:23,720
Then how will it cure him?

592
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,760
I was concerned

593
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,159
that the poison in my body

594
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,120
is changing all the time.

595
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,159
With this, the poison will be fixed.

596
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,880
With my ability as Venom Soul Master,

597
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:37,039
it's easy to cure the poison.

598
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,240
Kid,

599
00:26:38,439 --> 00:26:39,000
this is great.

600
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:40,319
You're smart

601
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,039
to think
of counteracting one poison with another.

602
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:43,360
I'll take this gift.

603
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,600
Senior, let me be frank.

604
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,279
This isn't a gift.

605
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,000
It's a deal.

606
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:51,799
Help your school to enter the final?

607
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,120
That's right.

608
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,799
But I can't fight for you

609
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:56,159
in the School Contest.

610
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,199
We can handle

611
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,240
the contest.

612
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,360
But whatever that is beyond the contest,

613
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:02,799
we need your help.

614
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,360
But...

615
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,240
I don't have 2,000 Gold Soul Coins.

616
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:07,919
We can solve

617
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,319
the money problem ourselves.

618
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,600
Great.

619
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:14,799
All right, you can go back first.

620
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:16,360
After I've cured the poison,

621
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,640
I'll look for you.

622
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,319
Wu, let's go.

623
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:26,519
I swear, I won't kiss him.

624
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:34,559
Both of you have come back?

625
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,279
You're back?

626
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,120
Come. Let's talk along the way.

627
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,480
You're back?

628
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,960
We were going to look for you.

629
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:41,319
I've also brought gifts for you all.

630
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,519
Gifts?

631
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,480
Weren't you captured?

632
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,559
Sounds like you were on a vacation.

633
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,679
Brother Dai, this is yours.

634
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,880
I'm glad that you're back.

635
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,799
You don't need to bring a gift for me.

636
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:49,919
Open and see.

637
00:27:50,199 --> 00:27:51,279
Have a look.

638
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,600
It feels like he's proposing to you.

639
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,760
Rare Powerful Chrysanthemum!

640
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,039
Premium herb.

641
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:02,600
It's super effective
for your Strength Type Martial Soul.

642
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,000
It suits you very much!

643
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:05,279
After eating it,

644
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,240
you should be able
to advance to Quadruple Soul Rings.

645
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,039
But...

646
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,880
How should I eat this?

647
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:11,600
First the stamen, then the petals.

648
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,399
Don't eat the rhizome.

649
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,360
Thank you.

650
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,880
Don't mention it.

651
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,439
Brother San, what about me?

652
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,880
There you go.

653
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:26,480
My goodness.

654
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,840
Eight Petal Fairy Orchid.

655
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,319
Eight Petal Fairy Orchid is mild.

656
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,480
It suits

657
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,519
Food Branch Soul Masters like you.

658
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,640
This suits you

659
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,360
more than Rare Powerful Chrysanthemum does.

660
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,080
These two are premium herbs.

661
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,279
Did you unearth

662
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,120
Venom Soul Master's treasure?

663
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:41,960
Daffodil Jade Beauty

664
00:28:42,199 --> 00:28:43,679
suits your Speed Type Martial Soul.

665
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:46,039
Thank you.

666
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,120
Hong Jun.

667
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,480
Let me see.

668
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,439
Rong Rong.

669
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,720
Mine? Thank you.

670
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,439
Yours is good.

671
00:28:58,439 --> 00:28:59,799
Mine is cooked?

672
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:01,679
Cockscomb Phoenix Flower

673
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,799
can refine your flame,

674
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,279
empower your flame power,

675
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,120
and avoid loss of control.

676
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:08,080
Thank you, Brother San.

677
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,319
Mine is shining.

678
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,799
Silk Woven Tulip

679
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:14,720
purifies the essence. It's suitable

680
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,919
for Support Branch Martial Souls to advance.

681
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,080
This is so great!

682
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,279
If Wu weren't here,

683
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,919
I would just give you a kiss.

684
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,279
Brother San must have stolen

685
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,240
Venom Soul Master's treasure.

686
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,360
We should hurry and eat them,

687
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,319
so that he can't have any evidence.

688
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,159
We can't let him have any chance
to grab them away.

689
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:29,960
Let's go.

690
00:29:30,199 --> 00:29:30,919
She's right.

691
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,799
She's got a point.

692
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,240
Ma Hong Jun, follow me.

693
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:33,919
Come.

694
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:37,360
Have a seat.

695
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:40,840
What's the matter?

696
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:43,439
It's your first time eating

697
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:44,480
this kind of premium herb, right?

698
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:45,480
Yes.

699
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,919
Don't you also think

700
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,640
this moment is very important?

701
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:50,480
I think

702
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,199
we should eat them together,

703
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,960
so there is a sense of ritual.

704
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:57,199
I'm also a person

705
00:29:57,199 --> 00:29:58,279
who pays attention to the sense of ritual.

706
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:00,240
Let me see

707
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,799
how we can make it even better.

708
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,600
Wait.

709
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:04,199
There's no need.

710
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,399
We eat half of our herbs,

711
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:08,039
and we take the remaining part

712
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,360
to cook with our food.

713
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,640
I really like you,

714
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,919
little brother!

715
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:14,760
You have a point. I'll go to get the pot.

716
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,360
Wait.

717
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:19,199
If we add some big sausages

718
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,360
and Weeping Forsythia,

719
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,159
would it enhance

720
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:21,840
the sense of ritual?

721
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,399
That's right.

722
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,080
That's even better.

723
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,840
I'll make them now.

724
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:28,360
Wait!

725
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:30,000
What now?

726
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Lend me

727
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:32,840
your pen and paper.

728
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:35,600
Pen and paper.

729
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,799
Here. What are these for?

730
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,480
We should sketch it out before we eat.

731
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,679
We don't know if we'll have

732
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:44,480
such a chance again

733
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,640
to eat this precious item.

734
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,159
We should draw it out as a memento.

735
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,000
Drawing before eating?

736
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,159
I heard that it's quite famous

737
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:51,799
in Tian Dou City.

738
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,039
Right.

739
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:54,240
Draw it.

740
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,519
What are you doing here?

741
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,439
Hurry and get the pot!

742
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,439
All right!

743
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,159
Master. Headmaster.

744
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,279
Tang San, you're back?

745
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,480
It's good that you're back. How are you?

746
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:18,039
Did Venom Soul Master do anything to you?

747
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:19,039
No.

748
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,199
Master,

749
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:22,640
you brought me

750
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,360
into the world of Soul Masters.

751
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,159
I've never given you any gifts.

752
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:28,439
This is for you.

753
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:36,199
Grade Nine Purple Mushroom?

754
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:38,679
Isn't your Soul Power inherently weak,

755
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,480
and you can't advance to Triple Soul Rings?

756
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,760
Grade Nine Purple Mushroom
is good for expanding limits.

757
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:44,640
Maybe this might help.

758
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:46,240
This suits you.

759
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,039
This premium herb was extinct long ago.

760
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,799
Headmaster, I'm not sure

761
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:51,039
which premium herb

762
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:51,840
suits you and Teacher Liu.

763
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,279
How about you pick it yourself?

764
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,439
Are there all premium herbs?

765
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,880
We can sell the rest to earn some money.

766
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,240
Let's see

767
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,159
if we can gather 2,000 Gold Soul Coins.

768
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:01,240
Venom Soul Master gave these to you?

769
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:03,760
He thanked me for curing his poison.

770
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:05,439
Now we have a chance to take part in the contest.

771
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,399
I'll talk to Liu Er Long now.

772
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,720
She knows a lot of people.

773
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:10,840
These are great things.

774
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:12,720
Here.

775
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:15,880
What's going on?

776
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:17,240
Venom Soul Master won't have

777
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,199
so many premium herbs.

778
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,799
Insofar as his character is concerned,

779
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:21,000
it's impossible
that he gave them all to you.

780
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:25,559
He brought me and Wu

781
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,120
to the Dream Valley.

782
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,439
I heard

783
00:32:29,439 --> 00:32:30,399
the voice in my dream again there.

784
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,640
She asked me to use Blue Silver Plant.

785
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,000
It was strange

786
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,439
that I was the only one
who could hear the voice.

787
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,039
So I used my Blue Silver Plant.

788
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,720
Wu and I

789
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,640
entered the interspace.

790
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:44,519
These herbs

791
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:46,399
were collected there.

792
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:48,600
The interspace?

793
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,640
The interspace can only be created

794
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,000
by a few Grand Soul Land Masters.

795
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:54,799
Without a special method,

796
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,199
no one can enter or leave.

797
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,159
Your Blue Silver Plant was the key

798
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,640
to open up the entrance
of the interspace.

799
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:02,919
In that case, the interspace

800
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,039
is especially meant for you.

801
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,559
Yes.

802
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,600
My mom left it to me.

803
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,080
I was holding Wu's hand at that time,

804
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,039
so

805
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:19,000
we got in together.

806
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:21,360
But my mom said

807
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,199
that except me, no one else can enter.

808
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,960
Not even my dad.

809
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:29,000
Have you seen your mother?

810
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,399
No.

811
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:44,319
The day when I was born,

812
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,640
my mom was

813
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,199
killed by Chief Qian Xun Ji

814
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,039
and his men from Martial Soul Hall.

815
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,279
Before she died,

816
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,919
she left a message to me.

817
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,199
So I knew the reason why she had been killed.

818
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,199
Master.

819
00:34:10,279 --> 00:34:12,080
You said only a few Grand Soul Land Masters

820
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,679
can create the interspace.

821
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:17,239
Was my mom

822
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,279
a Grand Soul Land Master?

823
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,440
I'm not sure about that.

824
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:25,120
There are not many Grand Soul Land Masters.

825
00:34:26,319 --> 00:34:27,799
Young female Grand Soul Land Masters

826
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:28,840
are even rarer.

827
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,279
Maybe you can get some information

828
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,519
from the library in Martial Soul Hall.

829
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,120
Those from Martial Soul Hall
who tried to kill my mom,

830
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,640
I won't let any of them go.

831
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,120
But Qian Xun Ji

832
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,400
was the former chief of Martial Soul Hall.

833
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,319
He's dead.

834
00:34:46,479 --> 00:34:47,200
Dead?

835
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,640
How?

836
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:49,840
Severe injuries.

837
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,120
Does he still have other family members?

838
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,039
Bi Bi Dong, her wife,

839
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:56,799
is the present chief.

840
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,080
They have a daughter, Qian Ren Xue.

841
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:01,880
But they

842
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,279
have nothing to do with your mother's death.

843
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,959
Qian Xun Ji was the mastermind.

844
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,920
When he tried to kill my mom,

845
00:35:09,799 --> 00:35:11,160
did he think about her child?

846
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:12,080
Her husband!

847
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,680
If one day,

848
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,559
I meet those people

849
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:15,640
from Martial Soul Hall,

850
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,519
I...

851
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:20,360
I'm not sure

852
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:22,880
if I'll act rationally.

853
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,519
Kid,

854
00:35:26,319 --> 00:35:27,600
hatred shouldn't be spread.

855
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,479
You shouldn't hate

856
00:35:29,479 --> 00:35:30,600
everyone from Martial Soul Hall.

857
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:32,519
Your mother wouldn't hope

858
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:34,039
that you live with hatred forever.

859
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:39,440
Telling you the truth

860
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:41,680
doesn't mean I want you to take revenge.

861
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:43,759
It's just the opposite.

862
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:47,200
I hope you won't have hatred in your heart.
