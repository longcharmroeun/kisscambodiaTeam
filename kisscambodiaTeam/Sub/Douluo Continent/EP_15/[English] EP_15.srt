I...

17
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,290
Is this your Tool Soul?

18
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:55,820
Yes.

19
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,330
He's a Food Branch Soul Master.

20
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,610
This must be the prerequisite

21
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,330
to use his Soul Skill.

22
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,250
Ou Si Ke.

23
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:05,690
Got it.

24
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,460
Full Recovery Big Sausage!

25
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,250
Is that your First Soul Skill?

26
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,380
Eat it.

27
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:32,780
This thing

28
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,300
was created by his Martial Soul?

29
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,170
Eat it up.

30
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:38,580
How is it?

31
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,060
Not bad.

32
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,660
I'm not tired anymore.

33
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,090
My Soul Power has recovered.

34
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,610
It replenishes stamina
and Soul Power instantly.

35
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,660
Now you all know

36
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,300
why Ou Si Ke is a genius.

37
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,810
Food Branch Soul Masters are uncommon.

38
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,330
Those with such power

39
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,220
are even rarer.

40
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,660
Give me a sausage as well.

41
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,450
Full Recovery Big Sausage!

42
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:07,940
Must you

43
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,220
shout like that every time?

44
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,890
If I don't, the sausage would be useless.

45
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,090
Really?

46
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,810
Now you know

47
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,580
how awkward I felt in the arena.

48
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,610
Ou Si Ke.

49
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,690
Hurry up, one sausage for everyone.

50
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,170
One...

51
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,020
One for everyone?

52
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,300
Full Recovery Big Sausage!

53
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,170
(Full Recovery Big Sausage!)

54
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,330
(Full Recovery Big Sausage!)

55
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,220
What kind of Soul Beast is that?

56
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,380
What a terrifying shriek.

57
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:48,970
Are these

58
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,020
created by your Martial Soul?

59
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:52,780
If you don't have them,

60
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,330
you can't use your Soul Skill, right?

61
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,660
Yes.

62
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,580
It's really a package.

63
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,300
You don't know

64
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,530
how many times I've been teased.

65
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:00,530
What's wrong with that?

66
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,220
It's not even ugly.

67
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,610
I told you

68
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,660
when I first saw it.

69
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,170
Your Martial Soul is special.

70
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,530
As someone in the Support Branch,

71
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,890
I'm envious of you.

72
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,020
How can this be ugly?

73
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:11,810
Rong Rong.

74
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,450
You're the only one

75
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,330
who has seen my Martial Soul

76
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,450
and praised it.

77
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,530
How can that be?

78
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,250
Don't you think

79
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,420
his outfit is awesome?

80
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,380
What's wrong with your taste?

81
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,260
It's not about taste.

82
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,660
Ou Si Ke's Martial Soul
is indeed exceptional.

83
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,450
Would you like to join
Martial Soul Hall?

84
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,010
I don't want to be a Soul Master.

85
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,820
I just want to go on researching my craft.

86
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,500
Oh, right.

87
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,730
I've heard that Martial Soul Hall is great.

88
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,820
Do you have any stories about it?

89
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,380
Tell me.

90
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,290
I'll write a play for you.

91
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,780
Don't ignore me.

92
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,130
Be careful, everyone.

93
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,780
We may be on the outskirts of the woods,

94
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,450
but we need to keep our guard up.

95
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,100
Headmaster.

96
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,500
Would the Human Faced Demon Spiders appear here?

97
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,820
They are violent.

98
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,450
But

99
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,450
they usually stay
in the deeper parts of the woods.

100
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,330
They're not often seen here.

101
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,260
Good.

102
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:30,730
What?

103
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,380
Why did you mention
the Human Faced Demon Spiders?

104
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,540
One of them appeared in my village

105
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,540
in the past.

106
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,700
It came

107
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,170
from the Star Forest, right?

108
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,610
Officer Su Yun Tao followed it

109
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,570
and chased it away.

110
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,820
Then he helped my Martial Soul awaken.

111
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,660
You met a violent Soul Beast

112
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,290
even before your
Martial Soul was awakened?

113
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,010
You must be terrified.

114
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,610
Yes, it was terrifying.

115
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,380
Back then, I even hit its eye

116
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,570
with a nail.

117
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,450
You blinded a Human Faced Demon Spider's eye

118
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,540
even without your Martial Soul?

119
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,820
I often threw

120
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,220
flying darts

121
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,130
and nails.

122
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,500
I can prove

123
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,410
that he's really good at it.

124
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,410
Walk faster, everyone.

125
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,330
Be careful.

126
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,380
Why?

127
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,780
If the Human Faced Demon Spider

128
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,980
has returned to the Star Forest,

129
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,940
it would try to take revenge,

130
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,820
and it might attack us.

131
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,660
The Human Faced Demon Spider
has a keen sense of smell.

132
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,010
As long as it remembers a scent,

133
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,570
it can track it, no matter how far it is.

134
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,260
Wu knows a lot about Soul Beasts.

135
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,330
You're right.

136
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,220
The Human Faced Demon Spider may appear anytime.

137
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,450
Tang San.

138
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,500
I think

139
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,660
you should stay close to me.

140
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,700
I'll let Luo San Pao out.

141
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:36,730
Its nose is sensitive.

142
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,700
It might alert us in advance.

143
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,410
Yes.

144
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,100
San Pao.

145
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,290
What a cute Martial Soul Pig!

146
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,540
It's actually a dog.

147
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,260
Actually, when I first saw it,

148
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,060
I thought it was a pig too.

149
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:02,570
What's wrong with it?

150
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:12,980
When I was in Suo Tuo City,

151
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,610
I met Hu Lie Na and Su Yun Tao.

152
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:15,890
You told me about it before.

153
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,660
At the entrance of Rose Inn.

154
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,410
I saw people from Martial Soul Hall appear

155
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,380
in Shi Lan Ke.

156
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,260
I was surprised,

157
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,940
so I got Luo San Pao

158
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,100
to remember Su Yun Tao's scent.

159
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,660
You mean

160
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:28,980
Su Yun Tao is nearby?

161
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,980
He's probably right behind us.

162
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,820
Is he protecting Hu Lie Na?

163
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:34,660
I don't know.

164
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,010
I want to ask him,

165
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,780
but the students...

166
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,850
I can handle the students.

167
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:39,610
Don't worry.

168
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,100
But, why do you

169
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,170
want to see Su Yun Tao?

170
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,060
The Star Forest is dangerous.

171
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,780
If he wants to protect Hu Lie Na,

172
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,820
he can join us.

173
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,170
He might be able to help us.

174
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,060
Also,

175
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,010
I want to ask him

176
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,660
why Hu Lie Na

177
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,780
came to Shi Lan Ke.

178
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,290
Protect the students.

179
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,260
I'll be back soon.

180
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,820
Then, we'll slow down.

181
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,500
You're the strongest among us.

182
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,010
Keep this with you.

183
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,330
Okay.

184
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,170
Where is he going?

185
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,260
He has something to do.

186
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:19,940
Let's go.

187
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,940
He'll catch up with us soon.

188
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:21,980
Let's go.

189
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:11,970
Wait.

190
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,700
There's something ahead.

191
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,210
Something is approaching us quickly.

192
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,340
Could it be the Human Faced Demon Spider?

193
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:31,820
Phoenix Tail Crest Serpent!

194
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,500
I wonder how old it is.

195
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,260
It's around six to eight meters long.

196
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,410
It's around 1,300

197
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,410
to 1,800 years old.

198
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:39,900
It's perfect for Ou Si Ke.

199
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,020
Stop it!

200
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:53,940
Are you okay?

201
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,530
The serpent's smoke is harmless.

202
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,410
It can only scare people off.

203
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:16,970
Good kick!

204
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,210
It's too fast. I can't catch it.

205
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:27,850
Qibao Boosts!

206
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:28,650
Second, Speed!

207
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,700
Got you!

208
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,340
Don't run!

209
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,940
Why didn't you do anything?

210
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,900
It's not for Brother Dai.

211
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:49,730
What do I have to do with this?

212
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,210
That's enough.

213
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,140
Forget it.

214
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,460
Ou Si Ke, come here!

215
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,940
Hurry, kill it!

216
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,260
But...

217
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,170
Absorb the Soul Ring at once.

218
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:58,770
But...

219
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,210
How should I kill it?

220
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:00,730
I...

221
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:01,530
Here.

222
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,460
Start from its crest.

223
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,260
Hold it.

224
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,700
Don't be afraid. It won't run away.

225
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:10,500
Stop!

226
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,380
This serpent is mine!

227
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:49,970
Who's there?

228
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:56,500
Su Yun Tao!

229
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,940
Why do you come to the Star Forest?

230
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,460
You know me?

231
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,700
Who are you?

232
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,460
Why are you here?

233
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,700
I admire you, actually.

234
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,650
Unfortunately,

235
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,650
you shouldn't have met me here.

236
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,380
Soon,

237
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,260
your teacher

238
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,970
will go to hell like you.

239
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,650
Follow them.

240
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,060
I know he's scary.

241
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,340
That's why I need your sense of smell.

242
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,410
Let's follow them at a distance.

243
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,820
They won't notice us.

244
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,820
Why do you say that this serpent is yours?

245
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,650
I am looking for a Soul Beast

246
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,380
to advance to the Third Soul Ring.

247
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,460
This Phoenix Tail Crest Serpent

248
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,530
is perfect.

249
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,140
Hand it over!

250
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,140
You want this serpent?

251
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:10,900
Sure.

252
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:11,850
How much do you want to pay?

253
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,500
As long as the price is good,

254
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,380
you can even take me away,

255
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,170
let alone the serpent.

256
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,850
I was merciful

257
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,850
that I didn't attack you at once.

258
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,730
Sure, got it.

259
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:27,820
Do it.

260
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,900
Kill the serpent!

261
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,340
How dare you!

262
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:44,340
What are you staring at?

263
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:45,410
Absorb the Soul Ring!

264
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,410
No money, no talk.

265
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,530
Catching Soul Beasts depends on your luck.

266
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,650
Please look for another one.

267
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,260
You are bold.

268
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,530
This has nothing to do with boldness.

269
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,140
First come, first served.

270
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,580
That's common sense.

271
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:09,850
Common sense?

272
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,340
In the world,

273
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,820
there is only power!

274
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,210
You are Lander from Golden Iron Triangle?

275
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,770
You know me?

276
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,700
I feel so honored.

277
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,410
You're trying to impress me with power?

278
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,290
No.

279
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,770
I told you just now.

280
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,020
As long as the price is good,

281
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,020
we can discuss anything.

282
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,460
Though I'm no match for you,

283
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,580
since I'm here,

284
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,210
my dear husband

285
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,210
must be coming as well!

286
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:53,380
Sister.

287
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,770
The Soul Beast is dead.

288
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,730
There's nothing to fight over now.

289
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,650
Looks like your dear husband

290
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:02,820
is in trouble.

291
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,900
Does he need help?

292
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,260
Just give me a good price.

293
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,730
Headmaster, you know her?

294
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,530
Her name is Chao Tian Xiang,

295
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:16,730
also known as the Serpent.

296
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,460
She's a Soul Saint with Seven Soul Rings.

297
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,410
Her husband, Meng Shu,

298
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,380
is also called the Dragon,

299
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,530
a Great Soul Land Master with Eight Soul Rings.

300
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,730
He's extremely strong.

301
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,530
How shameless.

302
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,020
A Soul Saint and a Great Soul Land Master.

303
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,260
They're so powerful,

304
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,820
but they still want a Millennium Soul Beast.

305
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,580
It's not for them, of course.

306
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,500
It's probably for their disciples.

307
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,580
They used to be

308
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,260
a famous pair of Soul Masters.

309
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,970
Then, they aligned themselves
with the royal family of Tian Dou.

310
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:41,940
Could they be helping someone

311
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,650
from the royal family of Tian Dou?

312
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,850
We'd better not offend them.

313
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,770
Stay away from them as far as possible.

314
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,460
Headmaster.

315
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,060
I want to ask her something.

316
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,900
Our plan is messed up now.

317
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,650
The Dragon was in danger,

318
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,940
and the Serpent is
on her way to save him.

319
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,090
I don't know what kind of Soul Beast

320
00:15:59,090 --> 00:15:59,850
is ahead.

321
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,530
But, danger is approaching.

322
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:02,770
Plan?

323
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:03,970
What plan?

324
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,820
Isn't everything going smoothly with us?

325
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,500
Ou Si Ke is already
absorbing the Soul Ring.

326
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,260
Yes, that's right.

327
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,820
Well...

328
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,770
When Ou Si Ke has advanced successfully,

329
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,970
we'll get out of here.

330
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:14,770
We need to plan ahead.

331
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,380
We're reaching the heart of the woods?

332
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:35,500
It's right ahead.

333
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:38,900
Don't get too close.

334
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,610
The time is coming.

335
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,140
Have you decided?

336
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,460
Who is he talking to?

337
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:18,220
I have nothing to do
with conflicts among humans.

338
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,460
The number of Soul Beasts in the Star Forest

339
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,490
has decreased sharply since 100 years ago.

340
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,060
If you do nothing about it,

341
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,980
what lies ahead of you

342
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,980
is extinction.

343
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,890
Help me defeat the enemy,

344
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,620
and I will give you a future.

345
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,620
I don't trust humans.

346
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,370
You don't have to trust me.

347
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,490
Just believe in the bigger picture.

348
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,770
Believe in benefits

349
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,220
and the results.

350
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,290
I shall wait for you

351
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,740
at the agreed time.

352
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:08,890
Yan Yan.

353
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,170
Are you okay?

354
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,940
We were just passing by.

355
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,580
We did not intend to disturb you.

356
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,580
Who are you talking to?

357
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,100
Why is it on the outskirts of the woods?

358
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,460
I don't know.

359
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,740
Something attracted it.

360
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,530
Titan Great Ape is not attacking.

361
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,860
It's probably just passing by.

362
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,940
If we work together,

363
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,290
can we defeat it?

364
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,580
Human strength can't rival
that of Titan Giant Ape.

365
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,220
Is it that strong?

366
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,340
We must

367
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,060
avoid treading along this path.

368
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,170
Once we find a venomous Soul Beast for Yan Yan,

369
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,170
we will leave the Star Forest immediately.

370
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,890
Ou Si Ke.

371
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:27,860
How is it?

372
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,130
Have you advanced successfully?

373
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:44,980
He has.

374
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,250
Nothing has changed.

375
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,370
Since you have advanced,

376
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,220
you are now a Soul Honour with Triple Soul Rings.

377
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,220
Check it now.

378
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:52,820
What's the Soul Skill
for the Third Soul Ring?

379
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:18,220
Rocketing Kiwi!

380
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,130
How did you know it's a kiwi?

381
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,460
I knew it

382
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,170
when I touched it.

383
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,290
Rocketing?

384
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:25,860
Let me try it.

385
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,700
It's sweet.

386
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,620
How is it? Do you feel like rocketing now?

387
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,650
She hasn't finished yet.

388
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:42,220
How is it?

389
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,250
Well...

390
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,010
Nothing happened.

391
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,100
Well...

392
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,340
I think you need to eat it up.

393
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,220
I did.

394
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,410
But...

395
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,100
You didn't eat its peel.

396
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,940
Try another one.

397
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,980
The peel, too?

398
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,530
I shall award you the honour
of being the first one

399
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,460
to fly.

400
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,290
I'm flying!

401
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:16,770
I can fly!

402
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,530
How do you control this?

403
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,340
How should I go down?

404
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,820
How should I go...

405
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,170
I'm getting dizzy.

406
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:29,770
How is it?

407
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:31,620
I'm fine.

408
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,410
I think I just need

409
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:34,770
to get used to it.

410
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,770
Listen.

411
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:37,980
I forgot to tell you

412
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,770
that you can only fly for 15 minutes.

413
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,530
It's rare to see a Soul Master
who can help people fly.

414
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:44,820
On the battlefield,

415
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,650
even 15 minutes are enough to turn the tables.

416
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:47,740
Ou Si Ke.

417
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:49,100
Join Martial Soul Hall,

418
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,250
and your talents will not go to waste.

419
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,460
I'm not interested.

420
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,890
We have the best resources
in Douluo Continent.

421
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:55,530
Didn't you hear him?

422
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,580
He's not interested.

423
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:57,740
Headmaster.

424
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,340
After eating the kiwi,

425
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,460
I can fly like you.

426
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:01,770
I'm proud of you.

427
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:02,770
Train harder.

428
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,340
But,

429
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,770
when my Martial Soul awakened,

430
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,170
I decided to give up fighting.

431
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,620
I have to take charge of my destiny!

432
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,530
What are you talking about?

433
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,370
Nonsense.

434
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,220
Cut the crap.

435
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,340
Get back to training

436
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,220
and become a Soul Master!

437
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,370
You've always taught us

438
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:15,940
that

439
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,460
what is said must be done,

440
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,340
and what is done will have results.

441
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,410
I want to be an artist!

442
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,060
If I can't convince you,

443
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,620
can't I beat you up?

444
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,290
Headmaster!

445
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,130
My training has not gone to waste.

446
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,770
You're already a Soul Honour.

447
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,370
Why do you still want to be an artist?

448
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,130
Every day,

449
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,740
all we do is fighting.

450
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,890
You're the one who
made me want to give up

451
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:31,460
my dream to be a Soul Master!

452
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,580
Talking back, are you?

453
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,700
What did you say?

454
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,860
You dreamed of being a Soul Master?

455
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,490
Good boy.

456
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,100
Excellent.

457
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:40,770
Here.

458
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,250
Let's test your Soul Power.

459
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,220
Come here.

460
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,820
You've just advanced to the Third Soul Ring.

461
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,410
You need time to accumulate power.

462
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,340
Everyone, test your Soul Power.

463
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,580
If any of you has accumulated enough power,

464
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,580
you can consider

465
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,770
advancing to the next Soul Ring.

466
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:56,740
Who wants to go first?

467
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:57,290
Me.

468
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,290
You just advanced to Double Soul Rings.

469
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,650
You have a long way to go...

470
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:26,890
He's got enough Soul Power.

471
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,060
He can advance to Triple Soul Rings now!

472
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,980
No. He still needs a little bit more.

473
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,370
It's impressive enough.

474
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:36,740
It's all bright!

475
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,170
Hey.

476
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,860
He was still slightly off the mark just now.

477
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,370
How did you do that?

478
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,700
I used Xuan Tian Strike.

479
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,530
You just advanced to Double Soul Rings,

480
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,860
and you've already gained enough power.

481
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,170
I say, Tang San.

482
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,580
Your rate of accumulating power

483
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,980
is simply matchless.

484
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,220
Wu has enough power too.

485
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,290
Wu has only one Soul Ring.

486
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,940
It's normal for her to advance.

487
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,620
This trip

488
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,370
should have been

489
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,340
a good chance for you
to capture Soul Beasts and advance.

490
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,890
But Master isn't here now.

491
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,010
I think

492
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,410
we should leave the woods now

493
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,060
to be safe.

494
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,410
When Master is back,

495
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,340
you can ask him

496
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:16,580
what kinds of Soul Beasts

497
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,530
are suitable for you to advance.

498
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,410
Headmaster, we can't leave.

499
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,340
I know you want to look for Du Gu Yan.

500
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,650
But it's too dangerous here.

501
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,010
Let's go back to Star Town first.

502
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,700
Master and I will check in

503
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,620
with our connections in Tian Dou City,

504
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,100
and we'll find Du Gu Yan.

505
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,250
Then, we'll follow the lead

506
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,370
and investigate Ye Zhi Qiu,

507
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:37,460
and force him to hand in the antidote.

508
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,530
If you insist on staying here,

509
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:40,820
you won't find her,

510
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,100
and you might die.

511
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,130
You might

512
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,650
even put all of us in danger.

513
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:50,010
That's enough.

514
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,170
Let's go back to Star Town
as soon as possible.

515
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,980
The last one will be penalized!

516
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,490
We're racing again?

517
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,820
What about Master?

518
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,410
He's probably behind us.

519
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,490
He'll catch up soon.

520
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,460
Let's go.

521
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,860
Okay, let's go.

522
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,860
I reckon one of us will lose.

523
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,770
Stupid.

524
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,130
I have the Rocketing Kiwi.

525
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,010
I won't lose.

526
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:08,580
Move on.

527
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,250
Kiwi?

528
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:11,340
Wu.

529
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:12,860
What are you looking?

530
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:13,700
Nothing.

531
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,220
Tang San, Wu, let's go.

532
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:16,460
Okay.

533
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,290
Let's go.

534
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:36,580
Rong Rong.

535
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,620
I'll show you my playscript.

536
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,370
You're annoying.

537
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:39,890
Listen.

538
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,010
It's an interesting play.

539
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:41,620
This time...

540
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,890
Is that a Soul Beast?

541
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:00,410
Really?

542
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,620
I think the sound

543
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,890
is far away.

544
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:32,890
Titan Giant Ape!

545
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,860
Did you hear that?

546
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,290
It's probably the Titan Giant Ape.

547
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,370
Lander is over there.

548
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,620
Shi Lan Ke School?

549
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,060
Probably.

550
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,650
We should save them, then.

551
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:56,530
Usually,

552
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,860
we'd try to help out.

553
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,580
But, that's Titan Giant Ape.

554
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:02,650
It's one of the strongest in the continent.

555
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,100
If we go, we'd die.

556
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,490
But those are human lives!

557
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,740
The first rule of survival
for Soul Masters

558
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,700
is to not risk your life

559
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,820
for someone you don't know.

560
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:13,620
Go.

561
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:14,010
Move.

562
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,940
King of the Forest.

563
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,250
We do not mean to transgress.

564
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,130
If this is your territory,

565
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,490
we will leave immediately.

566
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,530
I swear

567
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,580
we will never

568
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,890
enter the Star Forest again.

569
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,530
Since you're still upset,

570
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,130
I...

571
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,620
I can compensate.

572
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:38,580
Happy now?

573
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,010
Get out of here.

574
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,100
Go.

575
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:54,740
I'll help Headmaster.

576
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:45,100
Go!

577
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,010
Tang San!

578
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,060
Tang San!

579
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,220
How is it?

580
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,940
Everything should be fine now, Ou Si Ke.

581
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,170
Tang San.

582
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:36,860
Tang San?

583
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:39,530
Tang San?

584
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,290
Tang San?

585
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,130
Tang San?

586
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:44,130
He's awake.

587
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,490
Here.

588
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,060
Where's Wu?

589
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,130
She was taken away by Titan Giant Ape.

590
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:03,580
I'm not lying.

591
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,770
All of us were fighting just now.

592
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,370
Only you were hiding.

593
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,580
I didn't want to die.

594
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:10,740
Tang San.

595
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,370
It's my fault.

596
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,530
I didn't expect

597
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,620
Titan Giant Ape

598
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,370
would appear on the outskirts of the Star Forest.

599
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,130
No one could have expected it.

600
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,620
Take a rest, everyone.

601
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,940
Prepare to leave the forest.

602
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,010
What about Sister Wu?

603
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:26,940
Aren't we going to save her?

604
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,580
You saw how strong

605
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,620
Titan Giant Ape was.

606
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,980
If it goes all out,

607
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,130
we will all die for sure.

608
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,820
If we go to save her now,

609
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,460
we're going to be killed.

610
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,130
But, we can't leave Wu alone.

611
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,060
Headmaster.

612
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,490
I'll take you somewhere safe first.

613
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:45,620
Then, I'll come back to look for her.

614
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,010
Would she still be alive by then?

615
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,820
All of you are my students.

616
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,220
Now that someone is in trouble,

617
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,130
what I should do now

618
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:54,940
is to ensure that none of you

619
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,010
gets hurt.

620
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:58,820
I understand.

621
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,170
That's what we'll do, then.

622
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,770
You're giving up, too?

623
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,100
Headmaster is right.

624
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,010
Even if we go after it,

625
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,250
we can never defeat it.

626
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,770
Take a break,

627
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,010
and we'll go back.

628
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:14,860
Brother San.

629
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,060
By the way,

630
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,980
we fought Titan Giant Ape

631
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,770
over there,

632
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:19,820
right?

633
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,220
I left my Dragon's Beard there.

634
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,490
I need to pick it up.

635
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,290
Wu is in trouble,

636
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,620
and that's all you care?

637
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:31,820
You...

638
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,060
Ou Si Ke, you're not hurt, are you?

639
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:33,770
I'm not.

640
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:35,220
Please follow me.

641
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,490
Mu Bai.

642
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,940
Follow them.

643
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,010
I'll stay here and take care of the rest.

644
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,620
Since Titan Giant Ape was just here,

645
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,060
no other Soul Beasts

646
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,410
would come here for now.

647
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:45,220
Okay.

648
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:46,060
Let's go.

649
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,100
Be careful.

650
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:07,130
Found it!

651
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,460
Since we found it, let's go back.

652
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:11,530
Let me check somewhere else.

653
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:12,740
What...

654
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:14,250
Are you still

655
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,100
trying to look for your items?

656
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,340
Headmaster is waiting for us!

657
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,340
Brother Dai.

658
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,700
Wu was just taken away.

659
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,940
Tang San must be feeling awful.

660
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,980
Don't yell at him.

661
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,860
Let me help you.

662
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:25,940
Ou Si Ke.

663
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,890
Give me a Rocketing Kiwi.

664
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,740
Didn't you say that we'd die
if we go after the ape?

665
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,340
I know.

666
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,490
You're going to die.

667
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,580
That's why you shouldn't follow me.

668
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:35,890
Then...

669
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,370
I promised that I'd stay by her side.

670
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:38,580
Help me.

671
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:43,290
Rocketing Kiwi!

672
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,340
Tang San!

673
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:52,530
Headmaster.

674
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:54,460
What happened?

675
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,010
Tang San said...

676
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:55,820
Tang San told us

677
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,170
to leave the Star Forest
as soon as possible.

678
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,220
Once he finds Wu,

679
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,010
he'll come back to us.

680
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:03,940
If it weren't for Brother San,

681
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,250
I'd have died in the Nightfire Village.

682
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:07,770
Go ahead.

683
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,290
Brother Ou.

684
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,490
Give me a kiwi.

685
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:11,700
Are you crazy?

686
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,740
You won't make it in time.

687
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:15,490
I know it's dumb.

688
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,010
Never mind.

689
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,410
I am dumb.

690
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:19,250
No.

691
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,010
You can't defeat Titan Giant Ape.

692
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:22,460
What's the point of going?

693
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:24,460
When I was in the Nightfire Village,

694
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,490
Brother San didn't abandon me.

695
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,100
Now, I won't abandon him, either.

696
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,220
Give me one.

697
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,370
I can,

698
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,290
but we'll go together.

699
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:32,940
What?

700
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,770
You want to die too?

701
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:35,650
Headmaster.

702
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,410
You should go now.

703
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,250
It's safe ahead.

704
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,530
We're reaching the end of the forest soon.

705
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:42,370
We're safe now.

706
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,130
How about this?

707
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:43,580
Mu Bai.

708
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,410
Bring the girls back to Star Town.

709
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,460
I'll search for Tang San
and Wu with you.

710
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:48,860
Okay.

711
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,820
Headmaster, have you gone crazy too?

712
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,530
That's Titan Giant Ape.

713
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,740
You're going to die too.

714
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,290
Yes.

715
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,060
At least I can't

716
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,490
let a student die before me.

717
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:57,060
Go.

718
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:58,100
Headmaster.

719
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,650
It disappeared right in front of me.

720
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:00,370
I'm going too.

721
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:00,860
Me too.

722
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,620
Are you all crazy?

723
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,130
We're not forcing you to go.

724
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,410
Ou Si Ke.

725
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,220
Got it.

726
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:14,100
Rocketing Kiwi!

727
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,060
I don't have time.

728
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,690
If you won't let me go,

729
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,210
you can be my Third Soul Ring!

730
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,900
You made the right choice.

731
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,340
Recklessness only results in mistakes.

732
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,450
Leaving is the correct choice.

733
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:10,900
Besides, you're just

734
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,010
a Support Branch Soul Master.

735
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,820
You don't have
to fight in the frontlines.

736
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:19,490
What's wrong?

737
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,620
Ou Si Ke belongs
to the Support Branch too.

738
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,930
He's gone bonkers.

739
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:25,770
You don't have to follow him.

740
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,290
My dad told me

741
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:30,820
that Support Branch Soul Masters

742
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,620
aren't strong fighters,

743
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,250
so what we need to do

744
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,180
is to find a partner

745
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,530
whom we can entrust our life.

746
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,490
Only then can we

747
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,210
make full use

748
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,010
of our power.
