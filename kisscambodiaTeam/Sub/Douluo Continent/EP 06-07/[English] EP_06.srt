<i>Episode 6</i>

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,100
If you don't let go now,

4
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,420
your Martial Soul will be destroyed.

5
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,910
Let go of your hand!

6
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,700
Without pain, without sacrifice,

7
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,030
how I'm going to lead my way?

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:20,990
No.

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,740
You have burned your Blue Silver Plant.

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,310
If you don't want to lose your power

11
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:25,100
you better stop that right now!

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,030
Tang San!

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,100
Let go of your hand.

14
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,670
Open...!

15
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,950
Tang San! Tang San!

16
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:55,420
Finally.

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,190
Tang san!

18
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:10,390
Tang San!

19
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:15,830
Tang San!

20
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,110
Are you okay?

21
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,230
Don't waste your energy anymore.

22
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:35,780
Master.

23
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,870
Tang San... Tang San's
Blue Silver Plant.

24
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,420
Is it damaged?

25
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:48,950
Wu.

26
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:51,900
Wu!

27
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,190
Tang San.

28
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,830
What a surprise.

29
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,140
Wu got the Century Soul Ring as well.

30
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,900
Both of you are incredible.

31
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:03,950
Anyway.

32
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,670
No matter how impressive you are

33
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,260
you couldn't beat all of us.

34
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,030
Also, one of you had injured.

35
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,190
Whilst the other one...

36
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,700
has lost his power.

37
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,060
Last chance.

38
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,540
Be my follower.

39
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,030
Your Martial Soul has damaged and
you still want to fight back?

40
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,060
You're such a stubborn person.

41
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,670
You are just a footman

42
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,900
and you want to save him?

43
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,660
Double Soul Rings.

44
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,700
That's a pity. Only you alone.

45
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,980
I wonder what makes you stand out

46
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,630
in my uncle's mind.

47
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,380
Rubbish!

48
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:57,790
Plug your nose.

49
00:02:59,310 --> 00:02:59,910
Watch properly.

50
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,980
This is my Second Soul Skill.

51
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,470
Break wind like mist,

52
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,030
mesmerize to deep sleep Luo San Pao!

53
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,030
I've seen this before.

54
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:14,790
Hold your breath.

55
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,470
What kind of Soul Skill is this?

56
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:27,820
Let's go!

57
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,070
You... You can't run away from me.

58
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,590
I will go to Saint of Soul Village

59
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,030
and catch all of your family members.

60
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,940
Don't you mess with a footman.

61
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,470
One more punch for me.

62
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,220
I'm the son of the governor.

63
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,630
You can't hit me.

64
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,790
I'm going to teach you
some manners today.

65
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,700
I'm bringing justice

66
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,260
to those people
who are oppressed by you.

67
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,540
I want to kill you.

68
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,750
I'm going to torture your whole family.

69
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,630
I'm going to torture your whole family!

70
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:17,910
My whole family?

71
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,470
I'd like to see you try!

72
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,510
Stop! Stop it.

73
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,820
I'm sorry.
Please don't hit me anymore.

74
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,700
This school failed to teach you

75
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,470
how to respect people.

76
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,220
That's why you became so disrespectful.

77
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,510
Before I leave,

78
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,980
I teach you this lesson.

79
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,350
You better learn from it.

80
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,100
It seems like fists are sometimes

81
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:46,940
quite effective at solving problems.

82
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,310
Let's go.

83
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,220
I want to kill you.

84
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,420
I want to kill all of you!

85
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,700
Xiao Chen Yu won't let us go.

86
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,750
We must leave Nuoding City now.

87
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,260
I need to go to the
Saint of Soul Village.

88
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,540
I'm going to bring my dad along.

89
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,420
Okay.

90
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,660
You planned to kill me from the
beginning, don't you?

91
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,260
I can release you and your dad.

92
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,380
Master.

93
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,820
The Luo San Pao just now

94
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,910
is your Second Soul Skill?

95
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,470
Yes.

96
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,980
That smog can cause dizziness.

97
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:42,820
You are invincible then.

98
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:43,980
Depend on your opponent.

99
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,630
If your opponent has more than
two Soul Rings,

100
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,540
it won't work anymore.

101
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:47,870
We need to be quick.

102
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,510
Soul Honour set up the cage.

103
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,910
If the Soul Honour finds us,

104
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,540
we won't be able to defeat him.

105
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,260
Move faster, Wu.

106
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:54,540
Quick.

107
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,380
Officer Ling Feng.

108
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,260
Who killed the young master?

109
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,190
What?

110
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,100
Young master.

111
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,630
Tell me. Who did this?

112
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,630
It's Tang San.

113
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,580
Who is Tang San?

114
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,220
Tang San...

115
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,190
Tang San is one of the students.

116
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,950
And there is another student called Wu.

117
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,190
And a footman in school backing him up.

118
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,070
Why did nobody ask me to come here?

119
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,270
Young master said that

120
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,020
he doesn't want the governor
to know about this matter.

121
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,190
Where is Tang San?

122
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,190
Tang San comes from the
Saint of Soul Village.

123
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,270
What is the level of the two students?

124
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,660
Tang San and Wu

125
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,070
both have a century Soul Ring.

126
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,310
How about the footman?

127
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,950
I... I ... I...

128
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,310
I lost my consciousness.

129
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,750
I didn't know about

130
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,150
things that come up later.

131
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,510
But

132
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,220
that master is close to the headmaster.

133
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,270
We do not dare to hurt him.

134
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,020
But based on your capability,

135
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,270
they will surely fall into your hands.

136
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,710
I didn't plan to catch them.

137
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,540
Not... Not catching them?

138
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,950
Wake up the rest.

139
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,190
Head to Saint of Soul Village.

140
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,660
You know what kind of person
the governor is.

141
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,510
If we don't kill the murderer

142
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,710
everyone here

143
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,070
has to die.

144
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,390
This is the place I lived
since I was born.

145
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,630
My house is right in front.

146
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,870
Dad, I'm back.

147
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,390
He must have been drunk again.

148
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,780
I guess he is inside.

149
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,580
Dad.

150
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:09,830
Not here.

151
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,750
Perhaps he went to the
neighbour's house.

152
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,950
Based on the condition of this house

153
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,900
seems like it has been deserted
for quite some time.

154
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,950
How... How could that be possible?

155
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,340
Let's talk about your problem first.

156
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,710
Show me your Martial Soul.

157
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,660
What... What happened to it?

158
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,660
Is it damaged?

159
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,220
Not really.

160
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,580
But the basis has been affected.

161
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,100
The electric current on the cage

162
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,870
is the power of the Soul Honour.

163
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,510
You held on to it for too long.

164
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,020
That will cause some bad effects.

165
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,190
How long will it take to recover?

166
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,310
Will it get better?

167
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,630
We still have a choice.

168
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,580
What is that?

169
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,190
Get the Second Soul Ring
as soon as possible.

170
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,950
On our way here,
I've been thinking about

171
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,390
how to heal your Blue Silver Plant.

172
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,150
According to my analysis,

173
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,340
there is a prerequisite.

174
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,660
That is finding

175
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,980
a Soul Beast that has the same
traits as plants.

176
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,070
But...

177
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:12,870
Plant?

178
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,710
Why?

179
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,510
But you just got your First Soul Ring.

180
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,510
You didn't have time to refine
and accumulate your Soul Power.

181
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,870
If you absorb

182
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,630
the Second Soul Ring now,

183
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,540
the chances of failure
will be very high.

184
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,270
How high is it?

185
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,150
Over ninety percent.

186
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,660
How could this be?

187
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,750
Even so, we still have
ten percent of hope.

188
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,340
And the worst thing is

189
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,870
we might not be able to find

190
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,630
the Second Soul Ring that suits you
in a short time.

191
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,220
It's all my fault. I'm too weak.

192
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,750
Unable to protect both of you.

193
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,420
But instead, put both of you
into trouble.

194
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,220
Master. No one is to blame.

195
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,510
It was me who ask your help to
get the Soul Ring.

196
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,750
Also, you being caught
because of me.

197
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,900
I can't just walk away.

198
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,420
Remember to kill all of them later.

199
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,270
Bring back their body.

200
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,220
As an explanation.

201
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:18,750
Yes.

202
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,830
Seize them.

203
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,220
Let the governor handle them.

204
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:22,660
Officer.

205
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:23,780
Three of them.

206
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,310
All bring back?

207
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,420
Three of them.

208
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,710
Kill on the spot.

209
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,750
What?

210
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,220
Not bringing them to the governor?

211
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:33,950
Officer.

212
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,070
Are you going to kill all of them now?

213
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:36,540
But...

214
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,710
Don't you feel that is too hasty?

215
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,310
Kill now,

216
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,710
or I will kill you later.

217
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,420
And send you together
with their body

218
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,540
to the governor.

219
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,190
Things had happened.

220
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,580
We didn't have any choice.

221
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:50,660
Dad.

222
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,150
Three of you.

223
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,190
Leave the Saint of Soul Village
immediately.

224
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,660
Runaway as far as you can and
don't come back again.

225
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,580
Leave Saint of Soul Village?

226
00:11:59,070 --> 00:11:59,950
No, dad.

227
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,420
The reason we came back today

228
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,540
is due to some unexpected situations.

229
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,150
We fought with people in school.

230
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,150
Xiao Chen Yu has died.

231
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,580
Xiao Chen Yu has died?

232
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:11,630
That's impossible.

233
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,150
We just punch him several times.

234
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,100
But they insist that you killed him.

235
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:18,460
Dad.

236
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,830
No. I didn't kill anyone.

237
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,270
Those people in Nuoding City

238
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,750
might want all of you to pay for it.

239
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,190
I didn't kill Xiao Chen Yu.

240
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,020
They don't care about it.

241
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,950
They couldn't find the murderer.

242
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,950
So they want all of you to pay for it.

243
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,660
That doesn't make any sense.

244
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,340
Xiao Chen Yu has been killed.

245
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,710
The governor won't take it
lying down.

246
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:49,980
Wu.

247
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,660
I'll leave you here.

248
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,420
I got to go now.

249
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,390
Where are you going?

250
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,900
Find the village head.

251
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,190
You and master go first.

252
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,870
What are you talking about?

253
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:58,870
I'm not leaving.

254
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,870
I'm the one who has conflicts
with Xiao Chen Yu.

255
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,190
Also, I'm the person they want to find.

256
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,630
Both of us created the mess.

257
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,540
We should face it together.

258
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,310
No way.

259
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,750
Both of you leave now.

260
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,100
I will take full responsibility
for what I did.

261
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,220
I'm not leaving. I want to follow you.

262
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,390
But I worried I didn't have
enough strength

263
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,710
and unable to protect you.

264
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,780
I can protect you too.

265
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,340
Saint of Soul Village has
nothing to do with you.

266
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,510
But you have something
to do with me.

267
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:25,340
But...

268
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:25,870
No more excuses.

269
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:26,750
I'm a smart person.

270
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,580
You'll never get rid of me.

271
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:28,780
And this time

272
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,660
we can work together.

273
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,660
There will be higher chances
of winning.

274
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,420
If we didn't defeat them this time,

275
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,270
they will surely

276
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,340
keep troubling us.

277
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,310
Alright.

278
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:39,580
That's great!

279
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,310
I can fight together with you again.

280
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:42,270
This time

281
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,580
I'm going to beat the pants off them.

282
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,950
You are such a brave girl.

283
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,340
Of course. I'm the boss.

284
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,750
Quick. I'm afraid they might
arrive here soon.

285
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,070
Let's go.

286
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,710
Why are you still here?

287
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,710
You look familiar.

288
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,630
Did you work here before
as a knife smith?

289
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,070
No.

290
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,900
But I'm sure we met a long time ago.

291
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,190
Is you?

292
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,020
I thought you were dead?

293
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,190
Have you ever thought

294
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,830
what will happen to you

295
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,780
after find out who am I?

296
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,460
Hao Tian Hammer!

297
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,420
I almost couldn't

298
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,020
recognize you.

299
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,870
This is a Meteorite.

300
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,580
It is tougher than most substances

301
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,220
in the world.

302
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:45,900
What is it used for?

303
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,020
To seal.

304
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,460
There is a Hunted Vine underneath.

305
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,390
How old is it?

306
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:53,750
Six hundred years.

307
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,310
Almost to its limit.

308
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,190
And a Plant Branch Soul Beast.

309
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,830
It can be used as Tang San's Second Soul Ring.

310
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,630
The Martial Soul of Tang San
can finally restore.

311
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,070
Looks like you didn't
break it completely.

312
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,950
It has been sealed for many years.

313
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,190
I'm afraid it hasn't awakened.

314
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,580
A Hunted Vine with Plant Branch Soul Beast
is rarely seen.

315
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,020
How did you find it?

316
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,830
Tang San's mother kept it for him.

317
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,900
She also prepared

318
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,100
the Soul Beast of the First Soul Ring.

319
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,550
But...

320
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,510
the Thorn Apple Snake

321
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,300
you chose for him in Soul Hunting Forest

322
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,790
is more suitable.

323
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,750
So you were there during that time.

324
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,300
When you witness Tang San

325
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,390
fighting between life and death
with Thorn Apple Snake

326
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,430
why you didn't help him out?

327
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,060
He had to depend

328
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,550
on himself.

329
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,150
How about the Governor Office?

330
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,870
Do you plan to let him die too?

331
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,630
I will help him for the last time.

332
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,430
But you must promise me that

333
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,750
you won't say a word

334
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,750
about my past to him.

335
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,510
That's what happened in Nuoding City.

336
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,340
Those people in Governor Office
will arrive here in no time.

337
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,030
Village Head.

338
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,150
I know I have made a big mess this time

339
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,180
and might get everyone into trouble.

340
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,430
I have an idea.

341
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,460
Village Head, please tie me up

342
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,430
and send me to them.

343
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:17,820
I...

344
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,820
Only in this way

345
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,180
I can disassociate myself

346
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,220
from the Saint of Soul Village

347
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,270
and won't get the others into trouble.

348
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:22,510
You...

349
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,340
Please tie me up.

350
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,030
Me too.

351
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,030
I...

352
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,430
Officer.

353
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:34,700
Over there.

354
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,270
Officer. It's them.

355
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,670
Tang San and Wu.

356
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,910
Is it true that
young master Xiao has died?

357
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,220
Do you want to say that
you didn't kill him?

358
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,270
I really didn't kill him.

359
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,180
I never kill anyone.

360
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,150
Officer. We have got them.

361
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,790
Are we bringing them back

362
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,790
and send to the governor
for interrogation?

363
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,940
I remember the record in the
Office of Administration

364
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,790
clearly stated that

365
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,340
he has a dad who works as a
metalsmith in this village.

366
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:07,460
Yes.

367
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,150
Where is his house?

368
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,910
This thing has nothing to do
with my dad.

369
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,030
Young master has died.

370
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,700
Both of you are simply not enough.

371
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,030
I didn't kill anyone.

372
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,270
You want Tang San
to carry it alone?

373
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,550
I'll leave everything here to you.

374
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,100
What do you mean?

375
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,100
All of you stay in this village.

376
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,870
I will go to Nuoding City

377
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,060
to settle the source of this problem.

378
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,300
What if they reach here?

379
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,630
You can help him.

380
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:32,820
But how?

381
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,180
I only have double Soul Rings.

382
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,910
You're from the Blue Lightning
Tyrant tribe, right?

383
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,940
How did you know about that?

384
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,460
The Martial Soul of your family

385
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,030
is Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon.

386
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,430
And the mutation of Luo San Pao

387
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,430
is clearly because of
Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon

388
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,300
mutate in the wrong way.

389
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,060
Since you know about my strength,

390
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,670
you should aware that if here comes
someone stronger than me,

391
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,750
I won't be able to defeat him.

392
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,030
Let Tang San help you.

393
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,820
Tang San only has one Soul Ring.

394
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,940
Also, his ring is not stable.

395
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,340
You have Hunted Vine under the bed.

396
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,550
What if we fail?

397
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,510
Have you ever thought about

398
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,430
what will happen to Tang San?

399
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:04,910
He has to take full

400
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,150
responsibility for his action.

401
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:07,700
I need to go now.

402
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,270
Tang San has nothing to do with me.

403
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,390
Why should I stay?

404
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,820
Don't you worry I run away?

405
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,630
Whatever.

406
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,700
I won't risk my life staying here.

407
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,300
Did I owe both of you anything?

408
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:38,630
Officer.

409
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:39,940
Since we are here

410
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,060
how about we let the village head go?

411
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,180
Kill him.

412
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,670
He is the village head.

413
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:45,870
He is unlucky today.

414
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,580
Why?

415
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,630
Why you want to kill an
innocent person.

416
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,030
He is your village head.

417
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,510
So he is not considered innocent.

418
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,180
I said kill him.

419
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,180
Do you hear me?

420
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:06,910
Officer.

421
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,870
That guy is with them.

422
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:15,750
Bring him out.

423
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,100
What is the thing down there?

424
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,100
Nothing down there.

425
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:46,510
How dare you lie to me.

426
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:47,940
I...

427
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,300
Plant Branch Soul Beast.

428
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,580
Thunderbird Spike!

430
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,870
Village Head, you leave first.

431
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,910
You heard him. He wants to
kill the villagers.

432
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,180
Tang San, I...

433
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:37,790
Parasite.

434
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,270
This thing can parasitize.

435
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,580
Electric Light Rotation!

436
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,220
Let's go.

437
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,940
Master. Where is my dad?

438
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,100
What... What is this thing?

439
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,580
This is Hunted Vine.

440
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,700
Six hundred years old.

441
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,510
It can be used as your
Second Soul Ring.

442
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,980
The Hunted Vine can grow in an
adverse environment.

443
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,220
According to my mimicry theory,

444
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,060
It can make up your
damaged Martial Soul.

445
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,150
But... But why is it

446
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,460
under my house?

447
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,670
This creature is too strong.

448
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,510
How are we going to kill it?

449
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,700
Not now.

450
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,980
We can borrow its power

451
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,940
to attack the Soul Honour outside.

452
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,100
I think his Martial Soul is
Thunderbird.

453
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,460
The First Soul Skill is
Electric Current Spike.

454
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,700
And his Third Soul Skill is
Electric Ring Defense.

455
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:00,940
Beware of these.

456
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,870
Then we will get the chance
to attack him.

457
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,750
What about his Second Soul skill?

458
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:06,750
When he caught us,

459
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,630
an electric current was set
on the cage

460
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,220
I guess that is his Second Soul Skill.

461
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,700
Can we use Hunted Vine to attack him?

462
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,220
We can't.

463
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:15,940
The Hunted Vine will bring the

464
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,940
electric current through
the roots to the earth

465
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,180
for it to attack temporarily.

466
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,870
After a long time,

467
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,550
it will still be defeated.

468
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,390
I will attack him from behind.

469
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,300
You can't.

470
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,030
Tang San must do it by himself.

471
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:27,700
Why?

472
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,820
The Martial Soul of Tang San is
Blue Silver Plant.

473
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,550
Soul Power will diffuse.

474
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,060
The Hunted Vine will treat

475
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,700
you as a plant in short term.

476
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,630
So, it won't attack you.

477
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,940
But... But my Blue Silver Plant had...

478
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,150
You don't need a complete Martial Soul.

479
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,630
Maintain your Soul Power.

480
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,060
Just like that.

481
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,270
I will go right now.

482
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,150
Tang San.

483
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:55,940
You must remember that

484
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,270
you can't use your Martial Soul now

485
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:57,940
and couldn't kill.

486
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:59,180
So, find a way to

487
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,270
let the Hunted Vine coil around him.

488
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:01,980
The Hunted Vine can parasitize.

489
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,510
That way, he will be defeated.

490
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,910
Purple Demon Eye!

491
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,940
Electric. Fade.

492
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,340
Electric. Fade.

493
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,180
Electric.

494
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:37,790
Fade!

495
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,390
A simple trick

496
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,390
doesn't work on my third Soul Ring.

497
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:47,180
Mesmerize to deep sleep Luo San Pao!

498
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,700
I will let Luo San Pao
divert his attention.

499
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,460
But you need to find something

500
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,700
to block his electric current
temporarily.

501
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,220
How about the plank in the courtyard?

502
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,270
Controlling Crane Catching Dragon.

503
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:37,700
I did it.

504
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,150
He has been parasitized.

505
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,820
Chop it off right away?

506
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,940
What... What if it attacks me?

507
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,430
What I'm going to do?

508
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:30,750
Try to avoid it.

509
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,460
Alright. I got it.

510
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,550
Let me remind you again.

511
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,220
You just got your First Soul Ring.

512
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,030
So, if you absorb
the Second Soul Ring right now,

513
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:38,980
you will put your body under
extreme stress.

514
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,630
The pain you feel will be
much higher than usual.

515
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,340
Survive or not,

516
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,100
it all depends on your will.

517
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,460
How about we try it next time.

518
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,150
The Hunted Vine is very hard to find.

519
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,630
And the worst thing is

520
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,220
if he doesn't

521
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,700
absorb the Second Soul Ring now

522
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,460
his Blue Silver Plant will be
completely damaged.

523
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,550
Tang San.

524
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,510
You still have ten percent
of hope.

525
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,390
It's up to you to decide

526
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:00,980
whether want to give it a go.

527
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,550
I must become a Soul Master.

528
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,820
I'm going to risk it all no matter what.

529
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,150
I want to stay by his side.

530
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,750
Upgrade Soul Power

531
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,270
is the ordeal that everyone
must go through by themselves.

532
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,580
No one can help.

533
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:20,910
Endure no matter how hard it is.

534
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,580
You will be alright after wake up.

535
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,030
Trust me.

536
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,220
No.

537
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,700
Better trust my Martial Soul theory.

538
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,100
You can't go wrong.

539
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,270
It is just a plant.

540
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,510
I chop firewood since I was
a kid. No problem.

541
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,430
Tang San.

542
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,700
You need it more than me now.

543
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,220
Wait for me outside.

544
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,060
Alright.

545
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,390
Ghostly Trace.

546
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,270
Watch out!

547
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:04,630
Master!

548
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,430
Hang in there.

549
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:11,940
Tang San!

550
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,820
The governor won't forgive
all of you.

551
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,390
Tang San.

552
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,430
Tang San. Wake up.

553
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:13,670
What...

554
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,580
What should I do?

555
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,700
Tang San. Wake up.

556
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,390
Tang San!

557
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,430
Tang San!

558
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,750
He will be fine as long as
he could wake up.

559
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,790
Why he is not awake?

560
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:22,980
Let me try this.

561
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:07,750
Tang San.

562
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,030
Tang San. Wake up.

563
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,700
Tang San. You are awake.

564
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,030
Wu.

565
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:20,940
Master.

566
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,390
Master protected me from

567
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,180
a sudden attack by The Hunted Vine just now.

568
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,270
Where is he?

569
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:25,580
Over there.

570
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:27,820
Bring me there.

571
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:32,870
Master.

572
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,030
Master.

573
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:34,870
Master, wake up.

574
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:38,910
Master.

575
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:40,630
Master. He is awake.

576
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:41,300
He is awake.

577
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:42,540
Come.

578
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:43,500
Come.

579
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:49,430
Over here.

580
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,950
I knew you can make it.

581
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:57,950
Come.

582
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:59,260
Release Martial Soul.

583
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:12,470
You did it!

584
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,260
Tang San,

585
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,260
I guess you are the fastest among
all the Soul Masters

586
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,060
to get the double Soul Rings.

587
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,710
What kind of Soul Skill

588
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,870
does your Second Soul Ring bring to you?

589
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:33,100
I guess it only works on living things.

590
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:33,870
Living things?

591
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,340
Master, you had injured.

592
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,260
How about trying it on me.

593
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:38,820
I can make it.

594
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:40,300
Come on.

595
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:43,990
Aren't you wanting to save me just now?

596
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:45,910
The branch of this Hunted Vine

597
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,820
has parasitized my body.

598
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:47,950
I guess

599
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:48,910
only your Blue Silver Plant

600
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,230
can wipe them out entirely.

601
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:55,910
There is nothing to be afraid of.

602
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,060
Just control the intensity of
your Soul Power.
