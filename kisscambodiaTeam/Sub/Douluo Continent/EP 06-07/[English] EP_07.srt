<i>Episode 7</i>

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,470
No need to be afraid.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,710
You only have to master the Soul Power.

5
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,880
Parasite, I see.

6
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,440
Your second Soul Ring

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,110
inherited the power of the Haunted Vine.

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,920
And my wound

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,000
doesn't hurt at all.

10
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:42,590
It's Blue Silver Plant.

11
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:43,720
Your first Soul Ring's poison

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,830
has a transitory numbing effect.

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,390
But growing plants on the skin
doesn't seem that useful.

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,830
These Soul Skills can combine

15
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,080
and immobilize your enemy.

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,870
For example,

17
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,080
cover your enemy's

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,750
skin with Blue Silver Plant seeds.

19
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,080
The poison will numb the skin.

20
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,560
As such,

21
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:05,800
the seeds can grow

22
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,670
unbeknownst to the enemy.

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,670
It's foolproof.

24
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,520
Tang San can then

25
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,590
bind the enemy.

26
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,440
I was just planning to be a nuisance

27
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,280
but when I asked around...

28
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,230
You are cruel.

29
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,280
You kill for fun.

30
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,280
The hunter will become the hunted.

31
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,830
You already know this, don't you?

32
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,000
Dude,

33
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,750
no curfew today?

34
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,110
The governor is dead.

35
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,080
No more curfew.

36
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,670
What?

37
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,200
The governor is dead?

38
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,750
This afternoon,

39
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,520
when he was out with his guards,

40
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,800
a masked man appeared.

41
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,800
The masked man was so strong.

42
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,800
He rushed in,

43
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,110
knocked away all the Soul Masters,

44
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,110
and

45
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:37,920
with just one punch,

46
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,310
he smashed the governor and his litter.

47
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,590
What happened to our world?

48
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,960
You can tidy up

49
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,360
but it can never be restored.

50
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,990
But this is my home.

51
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,270
I should keep it clean and tidy.

52
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
Yu Xiao Gang.

53
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,960
They can't hear me.

54
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,400
I'm outside.

55
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,200
This can treat Martial Soul injury.

56
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,400
It's enough for you three.

57
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,680
Take it,

58
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,270
sleep well,

59
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,430
then you'll be fully healed.

60
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,920
No time for this.

61
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,270
We need to

62
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,680
deal with
the governor of Nuoding first.

63
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,430
This is only the first assault.

64
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,310
The governor won't give up so easily.

65
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,400
We need to leave soon.

66
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,430
The governor is gone.

67
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,360
You...

68
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,240
Farewell then.

69
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,030
Take care of Tang San.

70
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,360
He's your son.

71
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,240
You don't want to say hi to him?

72
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,310
Meeting me

73
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,360
will make him suffer.

74
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,750
And one day...

75
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,800
How did you find out?

76
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,520
I thought the governor would attack

77
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,710
so I buried some Blue Silver Plants.

78
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,710
I'll know when someone's near.

79
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,960
Who taught you that?

80
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,550
I came up with it.

81
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,430
Give us some time alone.

82
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,990
Master,

83
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,920
does Tang San's dad

84
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,470
hate him?

85
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,030
Why do you say so?

86
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,920
He came back only to meet you.

87
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,430
Obviously, he didn't want
to show himself.

88
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,990
Is he leaving?

89
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,920
Kids nowadays

90
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,960
are getting smarter.

91
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,960
Dad.

92
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,920
Sorry, dad.

93
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,920
I shouldn't have left home.

94
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,590
I shouldn’t have gone to school.

95
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,400
I won't ask any questions anymore.

96
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,240
I'll stay with you.

97
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:21,640
No.

98
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,030
You're smart.

99
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,360
You already know that

100
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,080
I'm no ordinary blacksmith.

101
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,150
Yet you never asked me.

102
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,030
Blacksmith or Soul Master,

103
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,240
none of this matters.

104
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,870
What matters is you're my dad.

105
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,270
Isn't that good enough?

106
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,750
I still have a business to tend to.

107
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,710
You won't be able to keep up.

108
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,080
I can learn.

109
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,590
I can be stronger.

110
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:51,520
Dad.

111
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,800
I have two Soul Rings now.

112
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,680
Look.

113
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,750
It's not enough.

114
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,400
Our family has a lot of secrets

115
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,470
but I can't tell you them

116
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,590
because they are related

117
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,270
to too many powerful individuals.

118
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,800
You're too weak for that.

119
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:10,990
Dad.

120
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,990
I can learn from you.

121
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,680
I can be stronger.

122
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:15,960
Dad.

123
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,590
We can retire together.

124
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,150
Let me take care of you.

125
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,550
A man shouldn't be so spineless.

126
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,470
You took the first step

127
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,640
and you decided to be

128
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,800
someone extraordinary.

129
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,990
Then you should

130
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,310
use your own power

131
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,800
to face the world.

132
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,590
Hiding in my shadow

133
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,470
won't make you grow.

134
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,120
But I want to train

135
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,030
and learn from you.

136
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,400
Master will bring you

137
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,200
to somewhere more suitable.

138
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,400
He's a good teacher.

139
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,030
Trust him.

140
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:54,990
Dad.

141
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,870
Are you abandoning me?

142
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,230
You're my son.

143
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,350
Forever will be.

144
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,110
When your willpower and Martial Soul

145
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,310
are more than powerful,

146
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:09,960
then

147
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,640
I will appear before you.

148
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,520
Dad.

149
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,640
I hope that day will come sooner.

150
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,520
Dad.

151
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,160
Where are you going?

152
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,670
You have your own path

153
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,480
and I

154
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,200
have to face my fate.

155
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:38,430
Dad.

156
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,430
Dad.

157
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,750
You're back.

158
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,990
What happened?

159
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,160
Master,

160
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,960
you're aware of my dad's identity.

161
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,080
What?

162
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,160
Why else

163
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,640
would he come and say goodbye to me?

164
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,870
I promised him to keep it as secret.

165
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:27,600
It's fine.

166
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
Once I'm strong enough,

167
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,960
I'll ask him myself.

168
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,040
Master,

169
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,230
I want to attend the best school

170
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,870
and be the strongest Soul Master.

171
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,750
I'll be with you.

172
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,720
The governor of Nuoding
is looking for you.

173
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,310
Most schools are no-go.

174
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,280
Any alternatives?

175
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,400
Martial Soul Hall or the seven clans.

176
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
Comparing both,

177
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,310
Martial Soul Hall

178
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,480
has the best resource and teachers.

179
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,080
But my dad prohibits me

180
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,670
from attending Martial Soul Hall.

181
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,080
It's okay.

182
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,600
Wu can go.

183
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,750
Master, can you help Wu then?

184
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,790
I'll go wherever you go.

185
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,040
No need to persuade me.

186
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,870
You're wasting your time.

187
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,520
Master.

188
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,910
What about the seven clans?

189
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,350
Other than normal schools
and Martial Soul Hall,

190
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,840
in Douluo Continent, there are

191
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,230
seven renowned Soul Master tribes.

192
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,960
These seven tribes stick to themselves

193
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,600
and established their own school.

194
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,750
Can we join?

195
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,600
Yes,

196
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,720
but when you're done,

197
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,160
you have to work for the clan.

198
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,350
That's only fair.

199
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,640
For how long?

200
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,040
The rest of your life.

201
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,280
And outsiders

202
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,990
are shunned
by the in-house Soul Masters.

203
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,550
So outsiders like us

204
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,910
can never succeed then?

205
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,280
Who do these clans

206
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,480
treat outsiders so?

207
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,840
Every clan

208
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,960
wants to control their own Soul Masters.

209
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,750
This is inevitable.

210
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,400
Any other option?

211
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,670
If you don't want

212
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,960
to be bound to any party,

213
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,040
there's one option:

214
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,080
Devil's School.

215
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,110
Stop!

216
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,840
It's not like this.

217
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,480
No?

218
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,910
Of course not.

219
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,670
Devil's School is a nickname.

220
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,280
Every student there

221
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,670
is powerful beyond comprehension,

222
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,640
like a real devil.

223
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,910
That powerful?

224
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,910
The first principal, Shi,

225
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,720
is a legendary being.

226
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,840
Hence the school name.

227
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,430
What's his full name?

228
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,750
Shi Lan Ke.

229
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,520
Devil's School sounds better.

230
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
Regardless of your status

231
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,790
or secret,

232
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,230
everyone is equal there.

233
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,350
Where is this Shi Lan Ke School?

234
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,400
In Suo Tuo City.

235
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,990
Suo Tuo City belongs to Tian Dou Empire.

236
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,910
To commemorate

237
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,160
an old but beautiful love story,

238
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,960
the two cities in this empire

239
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,200
are named after

240
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Suo Tuo and Fei Ren.

241
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,040
As time goes by,

242
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,960
Fei Ren City is in ruin

243
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,040
while Suo Tuo City continues to prosper.

244
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,230
All right. That's all.

245
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,720
It's quite far from here.

246
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:11,990
Rest early.

247
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,600
We'll move at sunrise.

248
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:14,640
Okay!

249
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,280
Wait,

250
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,960
one more thing.

251
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:20,840
What?

252
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:21,910
The rite.

253
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,960
Hold on.

254
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,670
The rite of apprenticeship is no
trifling matter on Douluo Continent.

255
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:27,870
We can only

256
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,400
have one mentor in our life.

257
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,790
I know. I'll kowtow.

258
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,990
I have two Soul Rings like you.

259
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,600
You'll surpass me in no time.

260
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,600
But you've long studied Martial Soul.

261
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,840
You're knowledgeable.

262
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,480
You deserve a better, stronger mentor.

263
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,790
But that's not what I want.

264
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,670
What then?

265
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,520
The confidence you gave me.

266
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,870
You told me that
Blue Silver Plant was useful.

267
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,550
You accompanied me

268
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,080
to Soul Hunting Forest.

269
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,280
You helped me find my Soul Ring.

270
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,430
That's just a deal.

271
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,910
I walked the talk.

272
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,600
But you used

273
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,960
your body to block the attack
from Thorn Apple Snake.

274
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,840
It was the heat of the moment.

275
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,790
This time,

276
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,230
you could've escaped alone.

277
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,400
Yet you came to
Saint of Soul Village with me.

278
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,480
You saved me

279
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,840
when the Haunted Vine attacked me.

280
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,430
You were injured due to me.

281
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,670
You saved me too.

282
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,200
And now

283
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,310
my wounds are healed.

284
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,790
Also,

285
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,550
my dad trusts you.

286
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,870
Need I say more?

287
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,640
You don't understand.

288
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,280
I'm useless.

289
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,990
If you want to be stronger,

290
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,160
you need to pick

291
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,520
someone powerful with a lot of resources

292
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,400
as your mentor.

293
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,550
If becoming stronger

294
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,670
means abandoning

295
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,640
my friend with whom
I went through life and death,

296
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,080
then what's the point of being strong?

297
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,110
You're the teacher
I trust and respect the most.

298

299
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:24,840
You're crying.

300
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,230
Crying?

301
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,520
No, I'm not.

302
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,430
Impossible.

303
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,350
Do you miss your dad?

304
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,790
I...

305
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,790
I don't know when

306
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,910
he'll be back again.

307
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,670
Last time when I left Nuoding

308
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,790
and home,

309
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,840
I felt like he'd be at home,

310
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,670
waiting for me.

311
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,280
It reassured me.

312
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,430
But this time,

313
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,350
I really don't have anyone else.

314
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,870
Cry it all out then.

315
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,840
I think

316
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,350
crying makes people weak.

317
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,910
Really?

318
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,310
Truth be told,

319
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,670
I cried a lot

320
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,910
when my parents died.

321
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,080
When I thought that
I couldn't see them again,

322
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,400
my tears came gushing out.

323
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,990
That time,

324
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,870
my eyes were as red as bunny eyes.

325
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,430
But Da Ming told me that

326
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,430
tears built character.

327
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,750
So I think you should cry.

328
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,750
After crying,

329
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,990
I felt much better.

330
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,670
Tang San,

331
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,110
you don't have a family now.

332
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,230
Neither do I.

333
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,280
What if from now onwards,

334
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,480
we'll be each other family.

335
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,640
And during tough times,

336
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,790
we can stand by each other.

337
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,400
Perhaps we'll feel better.

338
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,400
No?

339
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,750
Sure.

340
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,870
For real?

341
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,160
Then that's a promise.

342
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,430
From now onwards,

343
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,110
you're my sister.

344
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,110
I've always wanted a sister.

345
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:16,990
What?

346
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,750
Does this mean

347
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,910
I have to call you Brother San?

348
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,520
I'll sound like a kid.

349
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,040
You just have to keep it in mind.

350
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,430
You can still call me Tang San as usual.

351
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,840
All right then.

352
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,550
Will you

353
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,670
still braid my hair?

354
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,600
Of course.

355
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,310
Great.

356
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,720
That's a deal then.

357
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,080
From now onwards,

358
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,910
you're my sister.

359
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,720
No matter what happens,

360
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,150
I'll protect you.

361
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,310
I swear.

362
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,840
I'm also very strong.

363
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,720
I can protect you.

364
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,660
<i>Rose Inn</i>

365
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,000
Come.

366
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,600
Come here.

367
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,880
This is Rose Inn.

368
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,240
Why are we here

369
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,030
instead of the school?

370
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,720
Yeah.

371
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,030
Shi Lan Ke School has no fixed location.

372
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,670
To enter Shi Lan Ke,

373
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,790
the first step

374
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,480
is to enter this inn

375
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,790
and take the admission exam.

376
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,720
What kind of exam?

377
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,910
It's different every time.

378
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,270
In short, it's unorthodox.

379
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,150
Here.

380
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,430
Go ahead.

381
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,790
Let's see what

382
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,080
Devil's School has to offer.

383
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,670
That sounds interesting.

384
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,030
Let's go.

385
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,840
Hi.

386
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,200
We here to enroll into Devil's School.

387
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,840
Pay the registration fee.

388
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,120
How much?

389
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,120
50 Gold Soul Coins.

390
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,760
Fif...

391
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:15,840
So expensive.

392
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,550
25 per student?

393
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,760
No, 50 per student.

394
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,150
Check if we have it.

395
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
Give us a moment.

396
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,880
Too expensive.

397
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,550
That's all?

398
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,120
This is Rose Inn.

399
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,240
He should be inside.

400
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,600
For registration?

401
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,310
50 Gold Soul Coins, please.

402
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,030
Backyard.

403
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,510
Find a room yourself.

404
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,480
Move along then.

405
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:38,840
Sir.

406
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,550
She's so rich.

407
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,630
How about you two?

408
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,150
We

409
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,720
still need some money.

410
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,480
Learning tricks out in the wild

411
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,430
is no easy feat.

412
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,790
If it's just 7 or 8 Gold Soul Coins,

413
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,150
we can still make an exception.

414
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,910
Other than this one Gold Soul Coin

415
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,630
and other changes,

416
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:07,960
we still need

417
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,880
3,000...

418
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,790
3,000...

419
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,000
3,975 Copper Soul Coins.

420
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,600
That's a lot.

421
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
Let's go then.

422
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,120
Uhm...

423
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,720
the amount doesn't matter.

424
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,480
After all, fate brought us together.

425
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,310
Right?

426
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,550
What matters the most?

427
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,670
Kindness, don't you think?

428
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,430
Kindness.

429
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,240
Where are you two from?

430
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,600
Saint of Soul Village.

431
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,600
I see.

432
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,760
You've heard of it?

433
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,760
No.

434
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,270
You must be from somewhere far away.

435
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,510
You two must be exhausted, right?

436
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,480
As for Gold Soul Coins,

437
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,670
every bit counts.

438
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:00,670
No?

439
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,150
I couldn't agree more.

440
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,960
You're here,

441
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,550
just leave after the exam.

442
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,240
I mean,

443
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,310
you might as well take the exam.

444
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,840
Here, please.

445
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,200
Come.

446
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,760
Kindness is so important.

447
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,600
Remember that.

448
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,480
Where's Dai Mu Bai?

449
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:18,720
Looking for me?

450
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,000
I'd like a duel.

451
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:23,390
Sure.

452
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,840
No! No!

453
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,630
Who's going to pay

454
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,760
when you break everything here?

455
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:27,630
Inside.

456
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,120
Okay.

457
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,270
You...

458
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:33,840
Miss.

459
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,310
Today is not a good day for a duel.

460
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,310
Move away.

461
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,200
No,

462
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,360
he's gone.

463
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,630
I've been looking for him.

464
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,310
Move away.

465
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,080
Miss.

466
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,150
Today

467
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,670
is the first day of registration.

468
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,600
It's a sacred day.

469
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,080
We shouldn't fight.

470
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,760
Back off.

471
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,880
I have an idea.

472
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,910
An idea, Miss.

473
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,000
You can pay for the registration.

474
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,150
What?

475
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,430
Once you pay up,

476
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,390
you can find Dai Mu Bai in the backyard.

477
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,390
When you find him,

478
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,310
you can challenge him to a duel.

479
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,760
I'm not here for the registration.

480
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,310
Who cares?

481
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,880
Look,

482
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,000
if you pay,

483
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,480
you can find Dai Mu Bai

484
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,960
and duel him in the backyard.

485
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,030
Target achieved!

486
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,310
How much?

487
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:13,550
50 Gold Soul Coins.

488
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,840
Boss, look, more than 50.

489
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,480
This girl is decisive.

490
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,150
Exactly.

491
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,000
So decisive.

492
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,960
You two,

493
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,390
backyard, please.

494
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,080
Here.

495
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,960
It's not refundable.

496
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,480
No.

497
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,310
Is this for sale?

498
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:44,910
Boss.

499
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,480
This crystal

500
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,150
is murky and opaque.

501
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,080
No one wants it.

502
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:52,760
I want it.

503
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,200
It may look ugly

504
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,960
but it has potential.

505
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,360
Look,

506
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,910
you don't seem like a bad person.

507
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,430
How about 10 Gold Soul Coins?

508
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,670
10 Gold Soul Coins?

509
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,840
I don't have money.

510
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,390
How much do you have?

511
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,030
All my money

512
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,670
is in that pouch.

513
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,000
Oh well. Too bad.

514
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,360
Let's go then.

515
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,310
Hold on.

516
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,600
Can we buy it with this?

517
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,270
This is some excellent herbal medicine

518
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,790
found deep within the Star Forest.

519
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,240
Is this worth 10 Gold Soul Coins?

520
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,880
Let me see.

521
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,510
I...

522
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,200
That's worth 20 Gold Soul Coins.

523
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,790
Take it then.

524
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,670
We want this.

525
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,390
Not enough.

526
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:57,840
What do you mean?

527
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,150
I made a mistake.

528
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,430
The crystal costs 30 Gold Soul Coins.

529
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,910
But you said 10 Gold Soul Coins.

530
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,080
No, 30 Gold Soul Coins.

531
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:04,600
Look.

532
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,790
You can't increase the price on a whim!

533
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,840
I'm forgetful.

534
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:08,840
This huge crystal

535
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,880
costs 50 Gold Soul Coins.

536
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,270
Fif...

537
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,670
We're not interested.

538
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,360
Sorry.

539
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,480
Let's go, Wu.

540
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,510
Why do you want this?

541
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:20,550
Because it's

542
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,760
a good smelting material.

543
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:24,670
How good?

544
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:25,910
High quality.

545
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,080
Honesty.

546
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,910
You two passed the first test.

547
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,310
Why speak the truth?

548
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,670
If you say it's useless,

549
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,310
perhaps

550
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,840
I'll name a cheaper price.

551
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,390
But I shouldn't lie.

552
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,200
Let's go.

553
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,390
I really don't have money.

554
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,510
It's a gift.

555
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,670
A gift?

556
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,240
Thanks, sir.

557
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,270
Thanks, sir.

558
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,840
Let's go to the backyard then.

559
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,430
Give me a sec.

560
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:11,880
Miss.

561
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,200
Where's Dai Mu Bai?

562
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,550
He disappeared.

563
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,360
Hi, I'm Ou Si Ke.

564
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,360
I'm here for Dai Mu Bai.

565
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,480
Here.

566
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,720
I've heard of

567
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,840
your situation with him.

568
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,550
But the registration is over

569
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,200
and we have to organise
the admission exam.

570
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,480
We have rules

571
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,430
for everything, right?

572
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,760
You can't fight whenever you want.

573
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,080
Summon him.

574
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,120
I'll tell him myself.

575
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,670
Let's go somewhere.

576
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,550
Here.

577
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,480
This

578
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,430
is how I see it.

579
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,200
I'm fine

580
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,630
with a duel

581
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,390
but you plan to win,

582
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,630
right?

583
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,840
You arrived here

584
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,200
after a long journey.

585
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,910
Fighting him now

586
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,000
is disadvantageous.

587
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,480
After a long journey,

588
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,080
your stamina and mental state

589
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,480
are not at their peak.

590
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,720
What you need now

591
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,910
is some rest.

592
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,270
Don't you think?

593
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,960
Rest and recover

594
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,310
before fighting him.

595
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,430
There's an empty room there.

596
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,760
You can rest a bit.

597
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,310
I'll bring you some refreshments

598
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,310
and food.

599
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,310
Face wash too.

600
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,120
I'll bring them.

601
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:17,910
Cool?

602
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:26,910
Sorry.

603
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,390
Come with me.

604
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,600
This is the room for students.

605
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,600
Individual suite.

606
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,200
This is yours.

607
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,720
This is an individual suite?

608
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,510
Others paid 50 Gold Soul Coins.

609
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,760
You two can only afford
the price of one room.

610
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,600
I have some change here.

611
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,910
I think we're good here.

612
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,720
No worries.

613
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,200
Thanks.

614
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,840
I mean, boy and girl alone...

615
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,390
I don't mind.

616
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,670
It's not like that.

617
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,550
I'm not thinking about anything.

618
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,550
When's the exam?

619
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,030
What do we need?

620
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,480
I'm not sure

621
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,200
about the time and date.

622
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,910
But try not to

623
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:13,880
leave the backyard.

624
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,840
Are you from Shi Lan Ke School?

625
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:20,720
Not at all.

626
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,880
I'm just an inn staff.

627
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,720
I'm Tang San.

628
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:23,720
I'm Wu.

629
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,200
Tang San, Tang Wu.

630
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,000
Where's Tang Si?

631
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,670
It's the dancing "Wu".

632
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:31,600
My bad.

633
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,360
I shouldn't assume.

634
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,150
I'm

635
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:34,880
Ou Si Ke.

636
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,840
"Si" means yearning and "Ke" means guests.

637
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,240
Interesting name.

638
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,480
Really?

639
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,270
I prefer

640
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,550
you guys' name.

641
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,910
Simple and easy to remember.

642
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,430
Brother Ou,

643
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,000
can you lend me a hammer?

644
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,630
A hammer?

645
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:48,840
Here.

646
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,510
Thanks, Brother Ou.

647
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,310
If you need something else,

648
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,360
ask me.

649
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:56,790
Okay.

650
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,000
Why do you need a hammer?

651
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,270
What is this?

652
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,910
A tabular crystal.
[*It sounds similar to beef backstrap.]

653
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,360
For roasting?

654
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,720
It's a crystal.

655
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,270
Look carefully.

656
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,200
Impurity?

657
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,760
Acicular crystal.

658
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,240
I want them.

659
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,910
Cover the ears.

660
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,270
I mean your own ears.

661
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,910
It's not broken.

662
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:58,960
And then?

663
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,480
Are you looking for those thin strips?

664
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,760
I can't find any.

665
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,240
Are they destroyed?

666
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,000
Here.

667
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
It's not a thin strip.

668
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,790
What's this?

669
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,030
It will appear
once it's infused with Soul Power.

670
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,120
Try pulling it out.

671
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,840
This thing

672
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,960
can pierce a lot of things.

673
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,550
It will shrink without Soul Power.

674
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,510
Once ingested,

675
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,310
it can open the wound instantly.

676
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,720
Interesting.

677
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,760
It also goes by

678
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,960
Dragon's Beard.

679
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,120
Dragon's Beard.

680
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,790
Tiny but fatal.

681
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,310
Tabular crystal is rare

682
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,670
but Dragon's Beard of such quality

683
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,600
is even rarer.

684
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,390
How do you know so much?

685
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,240
It's on Xuan Tian Records.

686
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,430
What's that?

687
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,480
It's a book.

688
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,630
When I was small, my dad let me

689
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,030
learn some skills from it.

690
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:09,910
Some to train my eyes.

691
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:10,960
Some to train my dodging.

692
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,120
Some about

693
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,310
machinery and rare items.

694
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,630
Dragon's Beard was on it.

695
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,510
It sounds so cool.

696
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,030
What's odd is that

697
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,550
after getting my Martial Soul,

698
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,720
I realize I can mix Soul Power

699
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,310
with those skills I learnt
from Xuan Tian Records.

700
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,720
They are even more powerful.

701
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,480
How so?

702
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,430
I don't know.

703
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,480
Why didn't you ask Master?

704
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,760
I can't.

705
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,120
I promised my dad

706
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,510
not to tell anyone about

707
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,390
Xuan Tian Records.

708
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,080
Then why did you tell me?

709
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,880
Because you're my sister now.

710
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,960
Right, I'm your sister now.

711
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:50,550
Don't worry.

712
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:51,910
Your secret is safe with me.

713
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,310
Let's take half each.

714
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,390
This thing is strong.

715
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,240
Only use it as your

716
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,840
last resort.

717
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,720
Don't forget.

718
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,310
Hold on.

719
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:14,790
Come in.

720
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,000
What are you doing here?

721
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,600
Nothing.

722
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,030
Here.

723
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:19,790
Thanks.

724
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:20,720
You're done with it?

725
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:21,790
What did you destroy?

726
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:22,390
Tabular crystal.

727
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,880
Backstrap?

728
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,550
Why use a hammer on the backstrap?

729
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,080
Isn't it supposed to be roasted?

730
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,240
Not that. It's a tabular crystal.

731
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,630
Not beef backstrap?

732
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,670
Anything else?

733
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:35,790
Oh yes.

734
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,480
Come.

735
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,790
From now onwards,

736
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,630
we have to be careful

737
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,000
in this backyard.

738
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:44,910
Why?

739
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,270
One night,

740
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,550
I couldn't sleep well so I got up.

741
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,910
Guess what I found out?

742
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,120
Why couldn't you sleep?

743
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,270
Too cold.

744
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,310
The windows were open?

745
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,910
Maybe.

746
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:56,630
No blanket?

747
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,000
It's on the floor.

748
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,720
Your sleeping posture was bad.

749
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,000
In that case,

750
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,790
it'd be...

751
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,360
What sleeping posture?

752
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:03,960
I...

753
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,000
Where was I?

754
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:05,880
Bad sleeping posture.

755
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:06,760
It's...

756
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,550
Before that.

757
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,840
You woke up one night.

758
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,600
I woke up one night.

759
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,360
Guess what I saw.

760
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,360
I saw a human shadow

761
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,630
on my window.

762
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,390
A human shadow?

763
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,360
He's moving left and right

764
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,240
on my windows.

765
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,000
And poof, he's gone.

766
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,550
Isn't that scary?

767
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,910
You have bad eyesight.

768
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,480
Astigmatism I reckon.

769
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,760
I'm talking about a shadow.

770
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,000
A human shadow.

771
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,550
I'm...

772
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,430
Perhaps it was the admission exam?

773
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,760
It might be a school teacher.

774
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,080
What if it's a bad guy?

775
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,550
I don't think so.

776
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,200
Looks can be deceiving.

777
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,760
What if those people

778
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,200
are the enemies of the school.

779
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,080
What to do?

780
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,030
Also, look,

781
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,960
an admission exam

782
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,120
of a never-before-seen school

783
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,150
in an inn.

784
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,550
Isn't it odd?

785
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,630
Then why did you take the money?

786
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,200
It's...

787
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,720
My job and the school

788
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,310
are two different things.

789
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,240
Just be careful

790
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,720
from now onwards.

791
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,030
Be very cautious.

792
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:12,720
Sure.

793
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,480
Also,

794
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,670
never have a barbecue indoor.

795
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,360
If you break anything,

796
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,200
you have to pay.

797
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,270
Thank you.

798
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,000
Bye then.

799
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,790
Be very, very cautious.

800
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:25,790
Sweet dream.

801
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,030
Stay alert!

802
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,720
Is the school safe?

803
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,080
I don't know

804
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,000
but we have no other choice.

805
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,070
Master said that

806
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,480
there's only this school left for us.

807
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,350
True.

808
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,720
I wonder when the exam starts.

809
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,000
Those here for the exam,

810
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,630
come out now.

811
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,590
A troublemaker?

812
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,070
Is he looking for a fight?

813
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,000
Eh?

814
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,760
I didn't know Shi Lan Ke School
was for cowards.

815
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,760
No one?

816
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,390
Ou Si Ke?

817
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:45,350
What should we do?

818
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,000
Let's see what he wants first.

819
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,350
I'm not from Shi Lan Ke.

820
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,720
I'm just an inn staff.

821
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,590
I...

822
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,070
To put it simply,

823
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,800
Shi Lan Ke School and I have a history.

824
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,590
Rose Inn helps Shi Lan Ke

825
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,110
organize the admission exam,

826
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,430
which means it's just as guilty.
