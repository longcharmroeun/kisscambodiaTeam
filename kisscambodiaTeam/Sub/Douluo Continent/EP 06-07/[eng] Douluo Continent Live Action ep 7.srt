<i>Episode 7</i>

15
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,270
No need to be afraid.

16
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,510
You only have to master the Soul Power.

17
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,680
Parasite, I see.

18
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,240
Your second Soul Ring

19
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,910
inherited the power of the Haunted Vine.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,720
And my wound

21
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,800
doesn't hurt at all.

22
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,390
It's Blue Silver Plant.

23
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,520
Your first Soul Ring's poison

24
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,630
has a transitory numbing effect.

25
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,190
But growing plants on the skin
doesn't seem that useful.

26
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,630
These Soul Skills can combine

27
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,880
and immobilize your enemy.

28
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,670
For example,

29
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,880
cover your enemy's

30
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,550
skin with Blue Silver Plant seeds.

31
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,880
The poison will numb the skin.

32
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,360
As such,

33
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,600
the seeds can grow

34
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,470
unbeknownst to the enemy.

35
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,470
It's foolproof.

36
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,320
Tang San can then

37
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,390
bind the enemy.

38
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,240
I was just planning to be a nuisance

39
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,080
but when I asked around...

40
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,030
You are cruel.

41
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,080
You kill for fun.

42
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,080
The hunter will become the hunted.

43
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,630
You already know this, don't you?

44
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,800
Dude,

45
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,550
no curfew today?

46
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:02,910
The governor is dead.

47
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,880
No more curfew.

48
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,470
What?

49
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,000
The governor is dead?

50
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,550
This afternoon,

51
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,320
when he was out with his guards,

52
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,600
a masked man appeared.

53
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,600
The masked man was so strong.

54
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,600
He rushed in,

55
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,910
knocked away all the Soul Masters,

56
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:16,910
and

57
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,720
with just one punch,

58
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,110
he smashed the governor and his litter.

59
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,390
What happened to our world?

60
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,760
You can tidy up

61
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,160
but it can never be restored.

62
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,790
But this is my home.

63
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,070
I should keep it clean and tidy.

64
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
Yu Xiao Gang.

65
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,760
They can't hear me.

66
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,200
I'm outside.

67
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,000
This can treat Martial Soul injury.

68
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,200
It's enough for you three.

69
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,480
Take it,

70
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,070
sleep well,

71
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,230
then you'll be fully healed.

72
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,720
No time for this.

73
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,070
We need to

74
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,480
deal with
the governor of Nuoding first.

75
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,230
This is only the first assault.

76
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,110
The governor won't give up so easily.

77
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,200
We need to leave soon.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,230
The governor is gone.

79
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,160
You...

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,040
Farewell then.

81
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,830
Take care of Tang San.

82
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,160
He's your son.

83
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,040
You don't want to say hi to him?

84
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,110
Meeting me

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,160
will make him suffer.

86
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,550
And one day...

87
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,600
How did you find out?

88
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,320
I thought the governor would attack

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,510
so I buried some Blue Silver Plants.

90
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,510
I'll know when someone's near.

91
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,760
Who taught you that?

92
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,350
I came up with it.

93
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,230
Give us some time alone.

94
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,790
Master,

95
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,720
does Tang San's dad

96
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,270
hate him?

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,830
Why do you say so?

98
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,720
He came back only to meet you.

99
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,230
Obviously, he didn't want
to show himself.

100
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,790
Is he leaving?

101
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,720
Kids nowadays

102
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,760
are getting smarter.

103
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,760
Dad.

104
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,720
Sorry, dad.

105
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,720
I shouldn't have left home.

106
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,390
I shouldn’t have gone to school.

107
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,200
I won't ask any questions anymore.

108
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,040
I'll stay with you.

109
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,440
No.

110
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,830
You're smart.

111
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,160
You already know that

112
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,880
I'm no ordinary blacksmith.

113
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,950
Yet you never asked me.

114
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,830
Blacksmith or Soul Master,

115
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,040
none of this matters.

116
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,670
What matters is you're my dad.

117
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,070
Isn't that good enough?

118
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,550
I still have a business to tend to.

119
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,510
You won't be able to keep up.

120
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,880
I can learn.

121
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,390
I can be stronger.

122
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,320
Dad.

123
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,600
I have two Soul Rings now.

124
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,480
Look.

125
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,550
It's not enough.

126
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,200
Our family has a lot of secrets

127
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,270
but I can't tell you them

128
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,390
because they are related

129
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,070
to too many powerful individuals.

130
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,600
You're too weak for that.

131
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:50,790
Dad.

132
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,790
I can learn from you.

133
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,480
I can be stronger.

134
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:55,760
Dad.

135
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,390
We can retire together.

136
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,950
Let me take care of you.

137
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,350
A man shouldn't be so spineless.

138
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,270
You took the first step

139
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,440
and you decided to be

140
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,600
someone extraordinary.

141
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,790
Then you should

142
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,110
use your own power

143
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,600
to face the world.

144
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,390
Hiding in my shadow

145
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,270
won't make you grow.

146
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,920
But I want to train

147
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,830
and learn from you.

148
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,200
Master will bring you

149
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,000
to somewhere more suitable.

150
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,200
He's a good teacher.

151
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,830
Trust him.

152
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:34,790
Dad.

153
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,670
Are you abandoning me?

154
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,030
You're my son.

155
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,150
Forever will be.

156
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,910
When your willpower and Martial Soul

157
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,110
are more than powerful,

158
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,760
then

159
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,440
I will appear before you.

160
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,320
Dad.

161
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,440
I hope that day will come sooner.

162
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,320
Dad.

163
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,960
Where are you going?

164
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,470
You have your own path

165
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,280
and I

166
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,000
have to face my fate.

167
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,230
Dad.

168
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,230
Dad.

169
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,550
You're back.

170
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,790
What happened?

171
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,960
Master,

172
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,760
you're aware of my dad's identity.

173
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,880
What?

174
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:55,960
Why else

175
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,440
would he come and say goodbye to me?

176
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,670
I promised him to keep it as secret.

177
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,400
It's fine.

178
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
Once I'm strong enough,

179
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,760
I'll ask him myself.

180
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,840
Master,

181
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,030
I want to attend the best school

182
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,670
and be the strongest Soul Master.

183
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,550
I'll be with you.

184
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,520
The governor of Nuoding
is looking for you.

185
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,110
Most schools are no-go.

186
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,080
Any alternatives?

187
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,200
Martial Soul Hall or the seven clans.

188
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Comparing both,

189
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,110
Martial Soul Hall

190
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,280
has the best resource and teachers.

191
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,880
But my dad prohibits me

192
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,470
from attending Martial Soul Hall.

193
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,880
It's okay.

194
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,400
Wu can go.

195
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,550
Master, can you help Wu then?

196
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,590
I'll go wherever you go.

197
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,840
No need to persuade me.

198
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,670
You're wasting your time.

199
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,320
Master.

200
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,710
What about the seven clans?

201
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,150
Other than normal schools
and Martial Soul Hall,

202
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,640
in Douluo Continent, there are

203
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,030
seven renowned Soul Master tribes.

204
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,760
These seven tribes stick to themselves

205
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,400
and established their own school.

206
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,550
Can we join?

207
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,400
Yes,

208
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,520
but when you're done,

209
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,960
you have to work for the clan.

210
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,150
That's only fair.

211
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,440
For how long?

212
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,840
The rest of your life.

213
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,080
And outsiders

214
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,790
are shunned
by the in-house Soul Masters.

215
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,350
So outsiders like us

216
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,710
can never succeed then?

217
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,080
Who do these clans

218
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,280
treat outsiders so?

219
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,640
Every clan

220
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,760
wants to control their own Soul Masters.

221
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,550
This is inevitable.

222
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,200
Any other option?

223
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,470
If you don't want

224
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,760
to be bound to any party,

225
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,840
there's one option:

226
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,880
Devil's School.

227
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:53,910
Stop!

228
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,640
It's not like this.

229
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,280
No?

230
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,710
Of course not.

231
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,470
Devil's School is a nickname.

232
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,080
Every student there

233
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,470
is powerful beyond comprehension,

234
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,440
like a real devil.

235
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,710
That powerful?

236
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,710
The first principal, Shi,

237
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,520
is a legendary being.

238
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,640
Hence the school name.

239
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,230
What's his full name?

240
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,550
Shi Lan Ke.

241
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,320
Devil's School sounds better.

242
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,880
Regardless of your status

243
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,590
or secret,

244
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,030
everyone is equal there.

245
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,150
Where is this Shi Lan Ke School?

246
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,200
In Suo Tuo City.

247
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,790
Suo Tuo City belongs to Tian Dou Empire.

248
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,710
To commemorate

249
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,960
an old but beautiful love story,

250
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,760
the two cities in this empire

251
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,000
are named after

252
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Suo Tuo and Fei Ren.

253
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,840
As time goes by,

254
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,760
Fei Ren City is in ruin

255
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,840
while Suo Tuo City continues to prosper.

256
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,030
All right. That's all.

257
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,520
It's quite far from here.

258
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,790
Rest early.

259
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,400
We'll move at sunrise.

260
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,440
Okay!

261
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,080
Wait,

262
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,760
one more thing.

263
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,640
What?

264
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:01,710
The rite.

265
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:03,760
Hold on.

266
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,470
The rite of apprenticeship is no
trifling matter on Douluo Continent.

267
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,670
We can only

268
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,200
have one mentor in our life.

269
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,590
I know. I'll kowtow.

270
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,790
I have two Soul Rings like you.

271
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,400
You'll surpass me in no time.

272
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,400
But you've long studied Martial Soul.

273
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,640
You're knowledgeable.

274
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,280
You deserve a better, stronger mentor.

275
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,590
But that's not what I want.

276
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,470
What then?

277
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,320
The confidence you gave me.

278
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,670
You told me that
Blue Silver Plant was useful.

279
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,350
You accompanied me

280
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,880
to Soul Hunting Forest.

281
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,080
You helped me find my Soul Ring.

282
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,230
That's just a deal.

283
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,710
I walked the talk.

284
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,400
But you used

285
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,760
your body to block the attack
from Thorn Apple Snake.

286
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,640
It was the heat of the moment.

287
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,590
This time,

288
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,030
you could've escaped alone.

289
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,200
Yet you came to
Saint of Soul Village with me.

290
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,280
You saved me

291
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,640
when the Haunted Vine attacked me.

292
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,230
You were injured due to me.

293
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,470
You saved me too.

294
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,000
And now

295
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,110
my wounds are healed.

296
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,590
Also,

297
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,350
my dad trusts you.

298
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:05,670
Need I say more?

299
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,440
You don't understand.

300
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,080
I'm useless.

301
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,790
If you want to be stronger,

302
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,960
you need to pick

303
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,320
someone powerful with a lot of resources

304
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,200
as your mentor.

305
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,350
If becoming stronger

306
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,470
means abandoning

307
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,440
my friend with whom
I went through life and death,

308
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,880
then what's the point of being strong?

309
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,910
You're the teacher
I trust and respect the most.

310

311
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,640
You're crying.

312
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,030
Crying?

313
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,320
No, I'm not.

314
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,230
Impossible.

315
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,150
Do you miss your dad?

316
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,590
I...

317
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,590
I don't know when

318
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,710
he'll be back again.

319
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,470
Last time when I left Nuoding

320
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,590
and home,

321
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,640
I felt like he'd be at home,

322
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,470
waiting for me.

323
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,080
It reassured me.

324
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,230
But this time,

325
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,150
I really don't have anyone else.

326
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,670
Cry it all out then.

327
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,640
I think

328
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,150
crying makes people weak.

329
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,710
Really?

330
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,110
Truth be told,

331
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,470
I cried a lot

332
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,710
when my parents died.

333
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,880
When I thought that
I couldn't see them again,

334
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,200
my tears came gushing out.

335
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,790
That time,

336
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,670
my eyes were as red as bunny eyes.

337
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,230
But Da Ming told me that

338
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,230
tears built character.

339
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,550
So I think you should cry.

340
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,550
After crying,

341
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,790
I felt much better.

342
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,470
Tang San,

343
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,910
you don't have a family now.

344
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,030
Neither do I.

345
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,080
What if from now onwards,

346
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,280
we'll be each other family.

347
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,440
And during tough times,

348
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,590
we can stand by each other.

349
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,200
Perhaps we'll feel better.

350
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,200
No?

351
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,550
Sure.

352
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:43,670
For real?

353
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,960
Then that's a promise.

354
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,230
From now onwards,

355
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,910
you're my sister.

356
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,910
I've always wanted a sister.

357
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,790
What?

358
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,550
Does this mean

359
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,710
I have to call you Brother San?

360
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,320
I'll sound like a kid.

361
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,840
You just have to keep it in mind.

362
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,230
You can still call me Tang San as usual.

363
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,640
All right then.

364
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,350
Will you

365
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,470
still braid my hair?

366
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,400
Of course.

367
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,110
Great.

368
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,520
That's a deal then.

369
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
From now onwards,

370
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,710
you're my sister.

371
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,520
No matter what happens,

372
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:26,950
I'll protect you.

373
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,110
I swear.

374
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,640
I'm also very strong.

375
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,520
I can protect you.

376
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,460
<i>Rose Inn</i>

377
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:48,800
Come.

378
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,400
Come here.

379
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,680
This is Rose Inn.

380
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,040
Why are we here

381
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,830
instead of the school?

382
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,520
Yeah.

383
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,830
Shi Lan Ke School has no fixed location.

384
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,470
To enter Shi Lan Ke,

385
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,590
the first step

386
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,280
is to enter this inn

387
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,590
and take the admission exam.

388
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,520
What kind of exam?

389
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,710
It's different every time.

390
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,070
In short, it's unorthodox.

391
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:15,950
Here.

392
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,230
Go ahead.

393
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,590
Let's see what

394
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,880
Devil's School has to offer.

395
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,470
That sounds interesting.

396
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:25,830
Let's go.

397
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:45,640
Hi.

398
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,000
We here to enroll into Devil's School.

399
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,640
Pay the registration fee.

400
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:51,920
How much?

401
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,920
50 Gold Soul Coins.

402
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,560
Fif...

403
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,640
So expensive.

404
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,350
25 per student?

405
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,560
No, 50 per student.

406
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,950
Check if we have it.

407
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,280
Give us a moment.

408
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,680
Too expensive.

409
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,350
That's all?

410
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,920
This is Rose Inn.

411
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,040
He should be inside.

412
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,400
For registration?

413
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,110
50 Gold Soul Coins, please.

414
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,830
Backyard.

415
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,310
Find a room yourself.

416
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,280
Move along then.

417
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:18,640
Sir.

418
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,350
She's so rich.

419
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,430
How about you two?

420
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,950
We

421
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,520
still need some money.

422
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,280
Learning tricks out in the wild

423
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,230
is no easy feat.

424
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,590
If it's just 7 or 8 Gold Soul Coins,

425
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,950
we can still make an exception.

426
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,710
Other than this one Gold Soul Coin

427
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,430
and other changes,

428
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,760
we still need

429
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,680
3,000...

430
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,590
3,000...

431
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,800
3,975 Copper Soul Coins.

432
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,400
That's a lot.

433
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Let's go then.

434
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:10,920
Uhm...

435
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,520
the amount doesn't matter.

436
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,280
After all, fate brought us together.

437
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,110
Right?

438
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,350
What matters the most?

439
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,470
Kindness, don't you think?

440
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,230
Kindness.

441
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,040
Where are you two from?

442
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,400
Saint of Soul Village.

443
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,400
I see.

444
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,560
You've heard of it?

445
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,560
No.

446
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,070
You must be from somewhere far away.

447
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,310
You two must be exhausted, right?

448
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,280
As for Gold Soul Coins,

449
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,470
every bit counts.

450
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:40,470
No?

451
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,950
I couldn't agree more.

452
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,760
You're here,

453
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,350
just leave after the exam.

454
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,040
I mean,

455
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,110
you might as well take the exam.

456
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,640
Here, please.

457
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,000
Come.

458
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,560
Kindness is so important.

459
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,400
Remember that.

460
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,280
Where's Dai Mu Bai?

461
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:58,520
Looking for me?

462
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:59,800
I'd like a duel.

463
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,190
Sure.

464
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,640
No! No!

465
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,430
Who's going to pay

466
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,560
when you break everything here?

467
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,430
Inside.

468
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:08,920
Okay.

469
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,070
You...

470
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:13,640
Miss.

471
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,110
Today is not a good day for a duel.

472
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,110
Move away.

473
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,000
No,

474
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,160
he's gone.

475
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,430
I've been looking for him.

476
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,110
Move away.

477
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:20,880
Miss.

478
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:21,950
Today

479
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,470
is the first day of registration.

480
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,400
It's a sacred day.

481
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,880
We shouldn't fight.

482
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,560
Back off.

483
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,680
I have an idea.

484
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,710
An idea, Miss.

485
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,800
You can pay for the registration.

486
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:35,950
What?

487
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,230
Once you pay up,

488
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,190
you can find Dai Mu Bai in the backyard.

489
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,190
When you find him,

490
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,110
you can challenge him to a duel.

491
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,560
I'm not here for the registration.

492
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,110
Who cares?

493
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:44,680
Look,

494
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,800
if you pay,

495
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,280
you can find Dai Mu Bai

496
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,760
and duel him in the backyard.

497
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,830
Target achieved!

498
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,110
How much?

499
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,350
50 Gold Soul Coins.

500
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,640
Boss, look, more than 50.

501
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,280
This girl is decisive.

502
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:05,950
Exactly.

503
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,800
So decisive.

504
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,760
You two,

505
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,190
backyard, please.

506
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:11,880
Here.

507
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,760
It's not refundable.

508
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,280
No.

509
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,110
Is this for sale?

510
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,710
Boss.

511
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,280
This crystal

512
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,950
is murky and opaque.

513
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:29,880
No one wants it.

514
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,560
I want it.

515
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It may look ugly

516
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,760
but it has potential.

517
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,160
Look,

518
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,710
you don't seem like a bad person.

519
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,230
How about 10 Gold Soul Coins?

520
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,470
10 Gold Soul Coins?

521
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,640
I don't have money.

522
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,190
How much do you have?

523
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,830
All my money

524
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,470
is in that pouch.

525
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,800
Oh well. Too bad.

526
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,160
Let's go then.

527
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,110
Hold on.

528
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,400
Can we buy it with this?

529
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:18,070
This is some excellent herbal medicine

530
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,590
found deep within the Star Forest.

531
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,040
Is this worth 10 Gold Soul Coins?

532
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,680
Let me see.

533
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,310
I...

534
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,000
That's worth 20 Gold Soul Coins.

535
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,590
Take it then.

536
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,470
We want this.

537
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,190
Not enough.

538
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:37,640
What do you mean?

539
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,950
I made a mistake.

540
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,230
The crystal costs 30 Gold Soul Coins.

541
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,710
But you said 10 Gold Soul Coins.

542
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,880
No, 30 Gold Soul Coins.

543
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,400
Look.

544
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,590
You can't increase the price on a whim!

545
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,640
I'm forgetful.

546
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,640
This huge crystal

547
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,680
costs 50 Gold Soul Coins.

548
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,070
Fif...

549
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,470
We're not interested.

550
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,160
Sorry.

551
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,280
Let's go, Wu.

552
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,310
Why do you want this?

553
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:00,350
Because it's

554
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,560
a good smelting material.

555
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,470
How good?

556
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,710
High quality.

557
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,880
Honesty.

558
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,710
You two passed the first test.

559
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,110
Why speak the truth?

560
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,470
If you say it's useless,

561
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,110
perhaps

562
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,640
I'll name a cheaper price.

563
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,190
But I shouldn't lie.

564
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,000
Let's go.

565
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,190
I really don't have money.

566
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,310
It's a gift.

567
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,470
A gift?

568
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,040
Thanks, sir.

569
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,070
Thanks, sir.

570
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,640
Let's go to the backyard then.

571
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,230
Give me a sec.

572
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:51,680
Miss.

573
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,000
Where's Dai Mu Bai?

574
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,350
He disappeared.

575
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,160
Hi, I'm Ou Si Ke.

576
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,160
I'm here for Dai Mu Bai.

577
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,280
Here.

578
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,520
I've heard of

579
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,640
your situation with him.

580
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,350
But the registration is over

581
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,000
and we have to organise
the admission exam.

582
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,280
We have rules

583
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,230
for everything, right?

584
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,560
You can't fight whenever you want.

585
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:13,880
Summon him.

586
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,920
I'll tell him myself.

587
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,470
Let's go somewhere.

588
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,350
Here.

589
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,280
This

590
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,230
is how I see it.

591
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,000
I'm fine

592
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,430
with a duel

593
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,190
but you plan to win,

594
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,430
right?

595
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,640
You arrived here

596
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,000
after a long journey.

597
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,710
Fighting him now

598
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,800
is disadvantageous.

599
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,280
After a long journey,

600
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,880
your stamina and mental state

601
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,280
are not at their peak.

602
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,520
What you need now

603
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,710
is some rest.

604
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,070
Don't you think?

605
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,760
Rest and recover

606
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,110
before fighting him.

607
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,230
There's an empty room there.

608
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,560
You can rest a bit.

609
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,110
I'll bring you some refreshments

610
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,110
and food.

611
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,110
Face wash too.

612
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:56,920
I'll bring them.

613
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,710
Cool?

614
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,710
Sorry.

615
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,190
Come with me.

616
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,400
This is the room for students.

617
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,400
Individual suite.

618
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,000
This is yours.

619
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,520
This is an individual suite?

620
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,310
Others paid 50 Gold Soul Coins.

621
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,560
You two can only afford
the price of one room.

622
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,400
I have some change here.

623
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,710
I think we're good here.

624
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,520
No worries.

625
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,000
Thanks.

626
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,640
I mean, boy and girl alone...

627
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,190
I don't mind.

628
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,470
It's not like that.

629
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,350
I'm not thinking about anything.

630
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,350
When's the exam?

631
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,830
What do we need?

632
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,280
I'm not sure

633
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,000
about the time and date.

634
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,710
But try not to

635
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,680
leave the backyard.

636
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,640
Are you from Shi Lan Ke School?

637
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,520
Not at all.

638
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,680
I'm just an inn staff.

639
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,520
I'm Tang San.

640
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,520
I'm Wu.

641
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,000
Tang San, Tang Wu.

642
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,800
Where's Tang Si?

643
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,470
It's the dancing "Wu".

644
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,400
My bad.

645
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,160
I shouldn't assume.

646
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:13,950
I'm

647
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,680
Ou Si Ke.

648
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,640
"Si" means yearning and "Ke" means guests.

649
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,040
Interesting name.

650
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,280
Really?

651
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,070
I prefer

652
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,350
you guys' name.

653
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,710
Simple and easy to remember.

654
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,230
Brother Ou,

655
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,800
can you lend me a hammer?

656
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,430
A hammer?

657
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,640
Here.

658
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,310
Thanks, Brother Ou.

659
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,110
If you need something else,

660
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,160
ask me.

661
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,590
Okay.

662
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,800
Why do you need a hammer?

663
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,070
What is this?

664
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,710
A tabular crystal.
[*It sounds similar to beef backstrap.]

665
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,160
For roasting?

666
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,520
It's a crystal.

667
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,070
Look carefully.

668
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,000
Impurity?

669
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,560
Acicular crystal.

670
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,040
I want them.

671
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,710
Cover the ears.

672
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,070
I mean your own ears.

673
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,710
It's not broken.

674
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,760
And then?

675
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,280
Are you looking for those thin strips?

676
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,560
I can't find any.

677
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,040
Are they destroyed?

678
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:48,800
Here.

679
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,520
It's not a thin strip.

680
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,590
What's this?

681
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,830
It will appear
once it's infused with Soul Power.

682
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,920
Try pulling it out.

683
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,640
This thing

684
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,760
can pierce a lot of things.

685
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,350
It will shrink without Soul Power.

686
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,310
Once ingested,

687
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,110
it can open the wound instantly.

688
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,520
Interesting.

689
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,560
It also goes by

690
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,760
Dragon's Beard.

691
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,920
Dragon's Beard.

692
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,590
Tiny but fatal.

693
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,110
Tabular crystal is rare

694
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,470
but Dragon's Beard of such quality

695
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,400
is even rarer.

696
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,190
How do you know so much?

697
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,040
It's on Xuan Tian Records.

698
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:43,230
What's that?

699
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,280
It's a book.

700
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,430
When I was small, my dad let me

701
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,830
learn some skills from it.

702
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,710
Some to train my eyes.

703
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,760
Some to train my dodging.

704
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:51,920
Some about

705
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,110
machinery and rare items.

706
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,430
Dragon's Beard was on it.

707
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,310
It sounds so cool.

708
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,830
What's odd is that

709
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,350
after getting my Martial Soul,

710
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,520
I realize I can mix Soul Power

711
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,110
with those skills I learnt
from Xuan Tian Records.

712
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,520
They are even more powerful.

713
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,280
How so?

714
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,230
I don't know.

715
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,280
Why didn't you ask Master?

716
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,560
I can't.

717
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:16,920
I promised my dad

718
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,310
not to tell anyone about

719
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,190
Xuan Tian Records.

720
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,880
Then why did you tell me?

721
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,680
Because you're my sister now.

722
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,760
Right, I'm your sister now.

723
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,350
Don't worry.

724
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,710
Your secret is safe with me.

725
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,110
Let's take half each.

726
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,190
This thing is strong.

727
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,040
Only use it as your

728
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,640
last resort.

729
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,520
Don't forget.

730
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,110
Hold on.

731
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,590
Come in.

732
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,800
What are you doing here?

733
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,400
Nothing.

734
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:58,830
Here.

735
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,590
Thanks.

736
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,520
You're done with it?

737
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,590
What did you destroy?

738
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,190
Tabular crystal.

739
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,680
Backstrap?

740
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,350
Why use a hammer on the backstrap?

741
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,880
Isn't it supposed to be roasted?

742
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,040
Not that. It's a tabular crystal.

743
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,430
Not beef backstrap?

744
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,470
Anything else?

745
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,590
Oh yes.

746
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,280
Come.

747
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,590
From now onwards,

748
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,430
we have to be careful

749
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,800
in this backyard.

750
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:24,710
Why?

751
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,070
One night,

752
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,350
I couldn't sleep well so I got up.

753
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,710
Guess what I found out?

754
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:30,920
Why couldn't you sleep?

755
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,070
Too cold.

756
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,110
The windows were open?

757
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,710
Maybe.

758
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:36,430
No blanket?

759
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:37,800
It's on the floor.

760
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,520
Your sleeping posture was bad.

761
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:40,800
In that case,

762
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,590
it'd be...

763
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,160
What sleeping posture?

764
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,760
I...

765
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,800
Where was I?

766
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:45,680
Bad sleeping posture.

767
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,560
It's...

768
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,350
Before that.

769
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,640
You woke up one night.

770
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,400
I woke up one night.

771
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,160
Guess what I saw.

772
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,160
I saw a human shadow

773
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,430
on my window.

774
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,190
A human shadow?

775
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,160
He's moving left and right

776
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,040
on my windows.

777
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,800
And poof, he's gone.

778
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,350
Isn't that scary?

779
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,710
You have bad eyesight.

780
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,280
Astigmatism I reckon.

781
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,560
I'm talking about a shadow.

782
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,800
A human shadow.

783
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,350
I'm...

784
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,230
Perhaps it was the admission exam?

785
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,560
It might be a school teacher.

786
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,880
What if it's a bad guy?

787
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,350
I don't think so.

788
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,000
Looks can be deceiving.

789
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,560
What if those people

790
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,000
are the enemies of the school.

791
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:26,880
What to do?

792
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,830
Also, look,

793
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,760
an admission exam

794
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,920
of a never-before-seen school

795
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,950
in an inn.

796
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,350
Isn't it odd?

797
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,430
Then why did you take the money?

798
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
It's...

799
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,520
My job and the school

800
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,110
are two different things.

801
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,040
Just be careful

802
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,520
from now onwards.

803
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,830
Be very cautious.

804
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:52,520
Sure.

805
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,280
Also,

806
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,470
never have a barbecue indoor.

807
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,160
If you break anything,

808
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,000
you have to pay.

809
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,070
Thank you.

810
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:01,800
Bye then.

811
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,590
Be very, very cautious.

812
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,590
Sweet dream.

813
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:06,830
Stay alert!

814
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,520
Is the school safe?

815
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,880
I don't know

816
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,800
but we have no other choice.

817
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,870
Master said that

818
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,280
there's only this school left for us.

819
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,150
True.

820
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,520
I wonder when the exam starts.

821
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,800
Those here for the exam,

822
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,430
come out now.

823
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,390
A troublemaker?

824
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,870
Is he looking for a fight?

825
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,800
Eh?

826
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,560
I didn't know Shi Lan Ke School
was for cowards.

827
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,560
No one?

828
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,190
Ou Si Ke?

829
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,150
What should we do?

830
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,800
Let's see what he wants first.

831
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,150
I'm not from Shi Lan Ke.

832
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,520
I'm just an inn staff.

833
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,390
I...

834
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,870
To put it simply,

835
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,600
Shi Lan Ke School and I have a history.

836
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,390
Rose Inn helps Shi Lan Ke

837
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,910
organize the admission exam,

838
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,230
which means it's just as guilty.
