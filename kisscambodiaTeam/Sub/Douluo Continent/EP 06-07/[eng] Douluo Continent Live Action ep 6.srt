15
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,300
If you don't let go now,

16
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,620
your Martial Soul will be destroyed.

17
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,110
Let go of your hand!

18
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,900
Without pain, without sacrifice,

19
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,230
how I'm going to lead my way?

20
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,190
No.

21
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,940
You have burned your Blue Silver Plant.

22
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,510
If you don't want to lose your power

23
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,300
you better stop that right now!

24
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,230
Tang San!

25
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,300
Let go of your hand.

26
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,870
Open...!

27
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,150
Tang San! Tang San!

28
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,620
Finally.

29
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,390
Tang san!

30
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:50,590
Tang San!

31
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,030
Tang San!

32
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,310
Are you okay?

33
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,430
Don't waste your energy anymore.

34
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:15,980
Master.

35
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,070
Tang San... Tang San's
Blue Silver Plant.

36
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,620
Is it damaged?

37
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,150
Wu.

38
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,100
Wu!

39
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:34,390
Tang San.

40
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,030
What a surprise.

41
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,340
Wu got the Century Soul Ring as well.

42
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,100
Both of you are incredible.

43
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,150
Anyway.

44
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,870
No matter how impressive you are

45
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,460
you couldn't beat all of us.

46
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,230
Also, one of you had injured.

47
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,390
Whilst the other one...

48
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,900
has lost his power.

49
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,260
Last chance.

50
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,740
Be my follower.

51
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,230
Your Martial Soul has damaged and
you still want to fight back?

52
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,260
You're such a stubborn person.

53
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,870
You are just a footman

54
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,100
and you want to save him?

55
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,860
Double Soul Rings.

56
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,900
That's a pity. Only you alone.

57
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,180
I wonder what makes you stand out

58
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,830
in my uncle's mind.

59
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,580
Rubbish!

60
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:37,990
Plug your nose.

61
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,110
Watch properly.

62
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,180
This is my Second Soul Skill.

63
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,670
Break wind like mist,

64
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,230
mesmerize to deep sleep Luo San Pao!

65
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,230
I've seen this before.

66
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:54,990
Hold your breath.

67
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,670
What kind of Soul Skill is this?

68
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,020
Let's go!

69
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,270
You... You can't run away from me.

70
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,790
I will go to Saint of Soul Village

71
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,230
and catch all of your family members.

72
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,140
Don't you mess with a footman.

73
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,670
One more punch for me.

74
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,420
I'm the son of the governor.

75
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,830
You can't hit me.

76
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,990
I'm going to teach you
some manners today.

77
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,900
I'm bringing justice

78
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,460
to those people
who are oppressed by you.

79
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,740
I want to kill you.

80
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,950
I'm going to torture your whole family.

81
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,830
I'm going to torture your whole family!

82
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,110
My whole family?

83
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,670
I'd like to see you try!

84
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,710
Stop! Stop it.

85
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,020
I'm sorry.
Please don't hit me anymore.

86
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,900
This school failed to teach you

87
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,670
how to respect people.

88
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,420
That's why you became so disrespectful.

89
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,710
Before I leave,

90
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,180
I teach you this lesson.

91
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,550
You better learn from it.

92
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,300
It seems like fists are sometimes

93
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,140
quite effective at solving problems.

94
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,510
Let's go.

95
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,420
I want to kill you.

96
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,620
I want to kill all of you!

97
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,900
Xiao Chen Yu won't let us go.

98
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,950
We must leave Nuoding City now.

99
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,460
I need to go to the
Saint of Soul Village.

100
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,740
I'm going to bring my dad along.

101
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:45,620
Okay.

102
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,860
You planned to kill me from the
beginning, don't you?

103
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,460
I can release you and your dad.

104
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,580
Master.

105
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,020
The Luo San Pao just now

106
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,110
is your Second Soul Skill?

107
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:18,670
Yes.

108
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,180
That smog can cause dizziness.

109
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,020
You are invincible then.

110
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,180
Depend on your opponent.

111
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,830
If your opponent has more than
two Soul Rings,

112
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,740
it won't work anymore.

113
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,070
We need to be quick.

114
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,710
Soul Honour set up the cage.

115
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,110
If the Soul Honour finds us,

116
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,740
we won't be able to defeat him.

117
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,460
Move faster, Wu.

118
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:34,740
Quick.

119
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,580
Officer Ling Feng.

120
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,460
Who killed the young master?

121
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,390
What?

122
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,300
Young master.

123
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,830
Tell me. Who did this?

124
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:41,830
It's Tang San.

125
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:42,780
Who is Tang San?

126
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,420
Tang San...

127
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,390
Tang San is one of the students.

128
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,150
And there is another student called Wu.

129
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,390
And a footman in school backing him up.

130
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,270
Why did nobody ask me to come here?

131
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,470
Young master said that

132
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,220
he doesn't want the governor
to know about this matter.

133
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,390
Where is Tang San?

134
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,390
Tang San comes from the
Saint of Soul Village.

135
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,470
What is the level of the two students?

136
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,860
Tang San and Wu

137
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,270
both have a century Soul Ring.

138
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,510
How about the footman?

139
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,150
I... I ... I...

140
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,510
I lost my consciousness.

141
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,950
I didn't know about

142
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,350
things that come up later.

143
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:29,710
But

144
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,420
that master is close to the headmaster.

145
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,470
We do not dare to hurt him.

146
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,220
But based on your capability,

147
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,470
they will surely fall into your hands.

148
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,910
I didn't plan to catch them.

149
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,740
Not... Not catching them?

150
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,150
Wake up the rest.

151
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,390
Head to Saint of Soul Village.

152
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,860
You know what kind of person
the governor is.

153
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,710
If we don't kill the murderer

154
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,910
everyone here

155
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,270
has to die.

156
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,590
This is the place I lived
since I was born.

157
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,830
My house is right in front.

158
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,070
Dad, I'm back.

159
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,590
He must have been drunk again.

160
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,980
I guess he is inside.

161
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:41,780
Dad.

162
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,030
Not here.

163
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,950
Perhaps he went to the
neighbour's house.

164
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,150
Based on the condition of this house

165
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,100
seems like it has been deserted
for quite some time.

166
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,150
How... How could that be possible?

167
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,540
Let's talk about your problem first.

168
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:05,910
Show me your Martial Soul.

169
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,860
What... What happened to it?

170
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,860
Is it damaged?

171
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,420
Not really.

172
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,780
But the basis has been affected.

173
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,300
The electric current on the cage

174
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,070
is the power of the Soul Honour.

175
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,710
You held on to it for too long.

176
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,220
That will cause some bad effects.

177
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,390
How long will it take to recover?

178
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,510
Will it get better?

179
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,830
We still have a choice.

180
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,780
What is that?

181
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,390
Get the Second Soul Ring
as soon as possible.

182
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,150
On our way here,
I've been thinking about

183
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,590
how to heal your Blue Silver Plant.

184
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,350
According to my analysis,

185
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,540
there is a prerequisite.

186
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:49,860
That is finding

187
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,180
a Soul Beast that has the same
traits as plants.

188
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,270
But...

189
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,070
Plant?

190
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:54,910
Why?

191
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,710
But you just got your First Soul Ring.

192
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,710
You didn't have time to refine
and accumulate your Soul Power.

193
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,070
If you absorb

194
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:02,830
the Second Soul Ring now,

195
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,740
the chances of failure
will be very high.

196
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,470
How high is it?

197
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,350
Over ninety percent.

198
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,860
How could this be?

199
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,950
Even so, we still have
ten percent of hope.

200
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,540
And the worst thing is

201
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,070
we might not be able to find

202
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,830
the Second Soul Ring that suits you
in a short time.

203
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,420
It's all my fault. I'm too weak.

204
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:29,950
Unable to protect both of you.

205
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,620
But instead, put both of you
into trouble.

206
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,420
Master. No one is to blame.

207
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,710
It was me who ask your help to
get the Soul Ring.

208
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,950
Also, you being caught
because of me.

209
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,100
I can't just walk away.

210
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,620
Remember to kill all of them later.

211
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,470
Bring back their body.

212
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,420
As an explanation.

213
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:58,950
Yes.

214
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,030
Seize them.

215
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,420
Let the governor handle them.

216
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:02,860
Officer.

217
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:03,980
Three of them.

218
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:05,510
All bring back?

219
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:07,620
Three of them.

220
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:09,910
Kill on the spot.

221
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,950
What?

222
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,420
Not bringing them to the governor?

223
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,150
Officer.

224
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,270
Are you going to kill all of them now?

225
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,740
But...

226
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,910
Don't you feel that is too hasty?

227
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,510
Kill now,

228
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:21,910
or I will kill you later.

229
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,620
And send you together
with their body

230
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,740
to the governor.

231
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,390
Things had happened.

232
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,780
We didn't have any choice.

233
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,860
Dad.

234
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,350
Three of you.

235
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,390
Leave the Saint of Soul Village
immediately.

236
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,860
Runaway as far as you can and
don't come back again.

237
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,780
Leave Saint of Soul Village?

238
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,150
No, dad.

239
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,620
The reason we came back today

240
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,740
is due to some unexpected situations.

241
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,350
We fought with people in school.

242
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,350
Xiao Chen Yu has died.

243
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,780
Xiao Chen Yu has died?

244
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:51,830
That's impossible.

245
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,350
We just punch him several times.

246
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,300
But they insist that you killed him.

247
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:58,660
Dad.

248
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,030
No. I didn't kill anyone.

249
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,470
Those people in Nuoding City

250
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,950
might want all of you to pay for it.

251
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,390
I didn't kill Xiao Chen Yu.

252
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,220
They don't care about it.

253
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,150
They couldn't find the murderer.

254
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,150
So they want all of you to pay for it.

255
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,860
That doesn't make any sense.

256
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,540
Xiao Chen Yu has been killed.

257
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,910
The governor won't take it
lying down.

258
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,180
Wu.

259
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:31,860
I'll leave you here.

260
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:32,620
I got to go now.

261
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:33,590
Where are you going?

262
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,100
Find the village head.

263
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,390
You and master go first.

264
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,070
What are you talking about?

265
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,070
I'm not leaving.

266
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,070
I'm the one who has conflicts
with Xiao Chen Yu.

267
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,390
Also, I'm the person they want to find.

268
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,830
Both of us created the mess.

269
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:46,740
We should face it together.

270
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,510
No way.

271
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:48,950
Both of you leave now.

272
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,300
I will take full responsibility
for what I did.

273
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,420
I'm not leaving. I want to follow you.

274
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,590
But I worried I didn't have
enough strength

275
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,910
and unable to protect you.

276
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,980
I can protect you too.

277
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,540
Saint of Soul Village has
nothing to do with you.

278
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,710
But you have something
to do with me.

279
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:05,540
But...

280
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,070
No more excuses.

281
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:06,950
I'm a smart person.

282
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:07,780
You'll never get rid of me.

283
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:08,980
And this time

284
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,860
we can work together.

285
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,860
There will be higher chances
of winning.

286
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,620
If we didn't defeat them this time,

287
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,470
they will surely

288
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,540
keep troubling us.

289
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:18,510
Alright.

290
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:19,780
That's great!

291
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,510
I can fight together with you again.

292
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,470
This time

293
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,780
I'm going to beat the pants off them.

294
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,150
You are such a brave girl.

295
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,540
Of course. I'm the boss.

296
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,950
Quick. I'm afraid they might
arrive here soon.

297
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:29,270
Let's go.

298
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,910
Why are you still here?

299
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,910
You look familiar.

300
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,830
Did you work here before
as a knife smith?

301
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:40,270
No.

302
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,100
But I'm sure we met a long time ago.

303
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,390
Is you?

304
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,220
I thought you were dead?

305
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,390
Have you ever thought

306
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,030
what will happen to you

307
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,980
after find out who am I?

308
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:06,660
Hao Tian Hammer!

309
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,620
I almost couldn't

310
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,220
recognize you.

311
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,070
This is a Meteorite.

312
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,780
It is tougher than most substances

313
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,420
in the world.

314
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,100
What is it used for?

315
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,220
To seal.

316
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,660
There is a Hunted Vine underneath.

317
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:32,590
How old is it?

318
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:33,950
Six hundred years.

319
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,510
Almost to its limit.

320
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,390
And a Plant Branch Soul Beast.

321
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,030
It can be used as Tang San's Second Soul Ring.

322
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,830
The Martial Soul of Tang San
can finally restore.

323
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,270
Looks like you didn't
break it completely.

324
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,150
It has been sealed for many years.

325
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,390
I'm afraid it hasn't awakened.

326
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,780
A Hunted Vine with Plant Branch Soul Beast
is rarely seen.

327
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,220
How did you find it?

328
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,030
Tang San's mother kept it for him.

329
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,100
She also prepared

330
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,300
the Soul Beast of the First Soul Ring.

331
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:12,750
But...

332
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,710
the Thorn Apple Snake

333
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,500
you chose for him in Soul Hunting Forest

334
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:17,990
is more suitable.

335
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,950
So you were there during that time.

336
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:21,500
When you witness Tang San

337
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,590
fighting between life and death
with Thorn Apple Snake

338
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:23,630
why you didn't help him out?

339
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,260
He had to depend

340
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,750
on himself.

341
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,350
How about the Governor Office?

342
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,070
Do you plan to let him die too?

343
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,830
I will help him for the last time.

344
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,630
But you must promise me that

345
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:34,950
you won't say a word

346
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,950
about my past to him.

347
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,710
That's what happened in Nuoding City.

348
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,540
Those people in Governor Office
will arrive here in no time.

349
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,230
Village Head.

350
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,350
I know I have made a big mess this time

351
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,380
and might get everyone into trouble.

352
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,630
I have an idea.

353
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,660
Village Head, please tie me up

354
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,630
and send me to them.

355
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,020
I...

356
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,020
Only in this way

357
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,380
I can disassociate myself

358
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,420
from the Saint of Soul Village

359
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,470
and won't get the others into trouble.

360
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:02,710
You...

361
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,540
Please tie me up.

362
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,230
Me too.

363
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:07,230
I...

364
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:09,630
Officer.

365
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:14,900
Over there.

366
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,470
Officer. It's them.

367
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,870
Tang San and Wu.

368
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,110
Is it true that
young master Xiao has died?

369
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,420
Do you want to say that
you didn't kill him?

370
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,470
I really didn't kill him.

371
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,380
I never kill anyone.

372
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,350
Officer. We have got them.

373
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,990
Are we bringing them back

374
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:39,990
and send to the governor
for interrogation?

375
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,140
I remember the record in the
Office of Administration

376
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:42,990
clearly stated that

377
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,540
he has a dad who works as a
metalsmith in this village.

378
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:47,660
Yes.

379
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,350
Where is his house?

380
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,110
This thing has nothing to do
with my dad.

381
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,230
Young master has died.

382
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,900
Both of you are simply not enough.

383
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,230
I didn't kill anyone.

384
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,470
You want Tang San
to carry it alone?

385
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,750
I'll leave everything here to you.

386
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,300
What do you mean?

387
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,300
All of you stay in this village.

388
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,070
I will go to Nuoding City

389
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,260
to settle the source of this problem.

390
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,500
What if they reach here?

391
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,830
You can help him.

392
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,020
But how?

393
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,380
I only have double Soul Rings.

394
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,110
You're from the Blue Lightning
Tyrant tribe, right?

395
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,140
How did you know about that?

396
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,660
The Martial Soul of your family

397
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,230
is Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon.

398
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,630
And the mutation of Luo San Pao

399
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,630
is clearly because of
Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon

400
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,500
mutate in the wrong way.

401
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,260
Since you know about my strength,

402
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,870
you should aware that if here comes
someone stronger than me,

403
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:31,950
I won't be able to defeat him.

404
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,230
Let Tang San help you.

405
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,020
Tang San only has one Soul Ring.

406
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,140
Also, his ring is not stable.

407
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,540
You have Hunted Vine under the bed.

408
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,750
What if we fail?

409
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:42,710
Have you ever thought about

410
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,630
what will happen to Tang San?

411
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,110
He has to take full

412
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,350
responsibility for his action.

413
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:47,900
I need to go now.

414
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,470
Tang San has nothing to do with me.

415
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,590
Why should I stay?

416
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,020
Don't you worry I run away?

417
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,830
Whatever.

418
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,900
I won't risk my life staying here.

419
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,500
Did I owe both of you anything?

420
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:18,830
Officer.

421
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,140
Since we are here

422
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,260
how about we let the village head go?

423
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,380
Kill him.

424
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,870
He is the village head.

425
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,070
He is unlucky today.

426
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:26,780
Why?

427
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,830
Why you want to kill an
innocent person.

428
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,230
He is your village head.

429
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,710
So he is not considered innocent.

430
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,380
I said kill him.

431
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,380
Do you hear me?

432
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,110
Officer.

433
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,070
That guy is with them.

434
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:55,950
Bring him out.

435
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,300
What is the thing down there?

436
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,300
Nothing down there.

437
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,710
How dare you lie to me.

438
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,140
I...

439
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,500
Plant Branch Soul Beast.

440
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:47,780
Thunderbird Spike!

442
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,070
Village Head, you leave first.

443
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,110
You heard him. He wants to
kill the villagers.

444
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,380
Tang San, I...

445
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:17,990
Parasite.

446
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,470
This thing can parasitize.

447
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,780
Electric Light Rotation!

448
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,420
Let's go.

449
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,140
Master. Where is my dad?

450
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,300
What... What is this thing?

451
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:11,780
This is Hunted Vine.

452
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:12,900
Six hundred years old.

453
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,710
It can be used as your
Second Soul Ring.

454
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,180
The Hunted Vine can grow in an
adverse environment.

455
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,420
According to my mimicry theory,

456
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,260
It can make up your
damaged Martial Soul.

457
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,350
But... But why is it

458
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,660
under my house?

459
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,870
This creature is too strong.

460
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:29,710
How are we going to kill it?

461
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:30,900
Not now.

462
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,180
We can borrow its power

463
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,140
to attack the Soul Honour outside.

464
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,300
I think his Martial Soul is
Thunderbird.

465
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,660
The First Soul Skill is
Electric Current Spike.

466
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,900
And his Third Soul Skill is
Electric Ring Defense.

467
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,140
Beware of these.

468
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,070
Then we will get the chance
to attack him.

469
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,950
What about his Second Soul skill?

470
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:46,950
When he caught us,

471
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,830
an electric current was set
on the cage

472
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,420
I guess that is his Second Soul Skill.

473
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,900
Can we use Hunted Vine to attack him?

474
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,420
We can't.

475
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,140
The Hunted Vine will bring the

476
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,140
electric current through
the roots to the earth

477
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,380
for it to attack temporarily.

478
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,070
After a long time,

479
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,750
it will still be defeated.

480
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,590
I will attack him from behind.

481
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,500
You can't.

482
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,230
Tang San must do it by himself.

483
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,900
Why?

484
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,020
The Martial Soul of Tang San is
Blue Silver Plant.

485
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,750
Soul Power will diffuse.

486
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,260
The Hunted Vine will treat

487
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:12,900
you as a plant in short term.

488
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:13,830
So, it won't attack you.

489
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,140
But... But my Blue Silver Plant had...

490
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,350
You don't need a complete Martial Soul.

491
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,830
Maintain your Soul Power.

492
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,260
Just like that.

493
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:33,470
I will go right now.

494
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:35,350
Tang San.

495
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,140
You must remember that

496
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,470
you can't use your Martial Soul now

497
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,140
and couldn't kill.

498
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,380
So, find a way to

499
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,470
let the Hunted Vine coil around him.

500
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,180
The Hunted Vine can parasitize.

501
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,710
That way, he will be defeated.

502
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,110
Purple Demon Eye!

503
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,140
Electric. Fade.

504
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,540
Electric. Fade.

505
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,380
Electric.

506
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:17,990
Fade!

507
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,590
A simple trick

508
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,590
doesn't work on my third Soul Ring.

509
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,380
Mesmerize to deep sleep Luo San Pao!

510
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,900
I will let Luo San Pao
divert his attention.

511
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,660
But you need to find something

512
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:44,900
to block his electric current
temporarily.

513
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,420
How about the plank in the courtyard?

514
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,470
Controlling Crane Catching Dragon.

515
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:17,900
I did it.

516
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,350
He has been parasitized.

517
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,020
Chop it off right away?

518
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,140
What... What if it attacks me?

519
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:09,630
What I'm going to do?

520
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:10,950
Try to avoid it.

521
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,660
Alright. I got it.

522
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:14,750
Let me remind you again.

523
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,420
You just got your First Soul Ring.

524
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,230
So, if you absorb
the Second Soul Ring right now,

525
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,180
you will put your body under
extreme stress.

526
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,830
The pain you feel will be
much higher than usual.

527
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,540
Survive or not,

528
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,300
it all depends on your will.

529
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,660
How about we try it next time.

530
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,350
The Hunted Vine is very hard to find.

531
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,830
And the worst thing is

532
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,420
if he doesn't

533
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,900
absorb the Second Soul Ring now

534
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,660
his Blue Silver Plant will be
completely damaged.

535
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:35,750
Tang San.

536
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,710
You still have ten percent
of hope.

537
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:39,590
It's up to you to decide

538
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,180
whether want to give it a go.

539
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,750
I must become a Soul Master.

540
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,020
I'm going to risk it all no matter what.

541
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,350
I want to stay by his side.

542
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:53,950
Upgrade Soul Power

543
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,470
is the ordeal that everyone
must go through by themselves.

544
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,780
No one can help.

545
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,110
Endure no matter how hard it is.

546
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,780
You will be alright after wake up.

547
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,230
Trust me.

548
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:05,420
No.

549
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,900
Better trust my Martial Soul theory.

550
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:09,300
You can't go wrong.

551
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,470
It is just a plant.

552
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,710
I chop firewood since I was
a kid. No problem.

553
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:17,630
Tang San.

554
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,900
You need it more than me now.

555
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,420
Wait for me outside.

556
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,260
Alright.

557
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,590
Ghostly Trace.

558
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,470
Watch out!

559
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:44,830
Master!

560
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,630
Hang in there.

561
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,140
Tang San!

562
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,020
The governor won't forgive
all of you.

563
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:40,590
Tang San.

564
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,630
Tang San. Wake up.

565
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:53,870
What...

566
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:55,780
What should I do?

567
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:57,900
Tang San. Wake up.

568
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:45,590
Tang San!

569
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:46,630
Tang San!

570
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,950
He will be fine as long as
he could wake up.

571
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:53,990
Why he is not awake?

572
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,180
Let me try this.

573
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:47,950
Tang San.

574
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,230
Tang San. Wake up.

575
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,900
Tang San. You are awake.

576
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:58,230
Wu.

577
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,140
Master.

578
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,590
Master protected me from

579
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,380
a sudden attack by The Hunted Vine just now.

580
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:04,470
Where is he?

581
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:05,780
Over there.

582
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,020
Bring me there.

583
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,070
Master.

584
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,230
Master.

585
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,070
Master, wake up.

586
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,110
Master.

587
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:20,830
Master. He is awake.

588
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:21,500
He is awake.

589
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:22,740
Come.

590
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:23,700
Come.

591
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:29,630
Over here.

592
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,150
I knew you can make it.

593
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,150
Come.

594
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:39,460
Release Martial Soul.

595
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:52,670
You did it!

596
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:58,460
Tang San,

597
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,460
I guess you are the fastest among
all the Soul Masters

598
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,260
to get the double Soul Rings.

599
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,910
What kind of Soul Skill

600
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,070
does your Second Soul Ring bring to you?

601
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,300
I guess it only works on living things.

602
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,070
Living things?

603
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,540
Master, you had injured.

604
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,460
How about trying it on me.

605
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,020
I can make it.

606
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:20,500
Come on.

607
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,190
Aren't you wanting to save me just now?

608
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,110
The branch of this Hunted Vine

609
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,020
has parasitized my body.

610
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,150
I guess

611
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,110
only your Blue Silver Plant

612
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,430
can wipe them out entirely.

613
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,110
There is nothing to be afraid of.

614
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,260
Just control the intensity of
your Soul Power.
