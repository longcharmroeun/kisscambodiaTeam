Yes.

00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,860
Save it.

36
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,990
What’s there for you to be busy with?

37
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,430
Don’t you want to try the cakes I made?

38
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,000
Take it as an obligation
of being an uncle.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,800
Save me from being boring.

40
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,510

00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,030

00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,310

55
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,280

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,930
the clinical symptoms of

disturbance of consciousness,
and increased intracranial pressure.

62
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,850
Boss, aren’t you on a break?

63
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,020

00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:30,560
Hurry!

67
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,290
I’ve been on break for only a few days.

68
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,460
But you guys are slacking off, right?

69
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,170
I’m busy here.

70
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:35,770
Talk later.

71
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,610
I’ll hang up.

72
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,320
You must be lying.

73
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,480

77
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,930
Boss?

78
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,290
Why is that you?

79
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,700
It’s all because
you called me for nothing earlier.

80
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,700
I made the wrong call.

81
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,680

82
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,560

00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,130
Sorry, Boss.

85
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,330
It’s just we’re so occupied right now.

86
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,400
There was a chain collision
on the highway.

87
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,610

88
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,470

You’re asking me?

99
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,850
Tell me, have you made mistakes

100
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:12,760
while your Boss is on a break?

101
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,850
How come? I don’t want to be killed.

102
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,260
I called you to warn you that

103
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,090
you’ve got to care more about
your strange boyfriend.

104
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,170
What’s wrong with him?

105
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,530
I think he acts a little strange.

106
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,680
You need to lead him to a brighter road.

107
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,800
Make it clear.

108
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,520
Rong,

109
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,800
according to my observation these days,

110
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,460
I think my poor and lonely Boss

111
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,380
is really becoming more and more

112
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,610
like a weirdo.

113
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,530
You have to save him!

114
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,140
Okay.

115
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:39,850
I get it.

116
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:40,650
I’ll hang up.

117
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:47,820
Hello, Mom?

118
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,810
Dear, your Dad Jiang
wants to meet Shaoqing.

119
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,900
I told you I’ve been busy.

120
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,580
I can’t go back.

121
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,290
Save it.

122
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,970
If you don’t come back,
he and I will go to you.

123
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,130
Okay!

124
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,020
I’ll go back in a few days.

125
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,900
Don’t play tricks.
Take Shaoqing with you.

126
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,820
Okay, okay.

127
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,880
I will take him with me.

128
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,210
I’ll hang up.

129
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,440
You are back.

130
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,480
Remember we agreed to go for an outing?

131
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,100
I’ve figured out the destination.

132
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,020
<i>Domestic Departure Information</i>

133
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,050
Cong Rong.

134
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,730
Is the destination your...?

135
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,440
Yeah.

136
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:54,650
Right guess.

137
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:55,850
My home.

138
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,210
Let me show you

139
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,920
our family photos.

140
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,090
This was taken when I was at college.

141
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,730
This one is my favorite.

142
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,880
Look, the three of us all have
the same expression.

143
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,480
This is a picture
of my parents on their trip.

144
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,500
Mom loves travelling.

145
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,850
So, Dad Jiang travels with her.

146
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,210
The two of you seem to get along well.

147
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:19,970
That’s right.

148
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,360
Dad Jiang treats me
just as his natural child.

149
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,820
Scolds me when I do wrong.

150
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,730
Praises me when I do right.

151
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,290
There’s no barrier between us.

152
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,880
Knowing that you were a naughty kid,

153
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,650
I didn’t expect that
you accepted him so smoothly.

154
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,010
Of course not.

155
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,650
I excluded him a lot at first.

156
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,970
Guess what I used to do to him?

157
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,720
I spat out watermelon seeds at him.

158
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:41,560
He was unwilling to be outdone.

159
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,130
So, he fought back in the same way.

160
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,960
But every time he would
win me by one more seed.

161
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,680
Later, melon vines grew out
in the flowerpot.

162
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,340
Your mom didn’t scold you?

163
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,250
She did.

164
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,010
I don’t know when exactly but gradually,

165
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,010
Dad Jiang and I were no longer
hostile to each other.

166
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,010
We became concerned about each other.

167
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,530
Are you happy?

168
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,650
Yes,

169
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,800
I am.

170
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,200
Dad Jiang takes infinite care of my mom.

171
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,080
They live very happily.

172
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,220
I told you,

173
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,680
it’s only a casual dinner.

174
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,490
If I knew you would buy so many gifts,

175
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,650
I should’ve told you about it
till we get to the door.

176
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,530
This is my first formal visit.

177
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,920
Of course I must prepare
as many gifts as possible.

178
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,370
What if my father-in-law
considered me inconsiderate

179
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,410
and didn’t want to marry you to me?

180
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,650
Father-in-law?

181
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,530
Don’t call him that when you meet.

182
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,200
So, your family live inside the school.

183
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,260
Dad Jiang is a professor of philosophy.

184
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,840
Of course we live inside the school.

185
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,650
We are already near your home.

186
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,920
We don’t need to hurry.

187
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,680
Show me around your Alma Mater.

188
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,500
I’m quite curious of
your school environment.

189
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,100
No. You’re curious of what happened here

190
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,840
when you and I
were separated, aren’t you?

191
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:57,740
Let’s go.

192
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,340
I’ll take you to a place.

193
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:58,920
Okay.

194
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,050
That is the administrative building.

195
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,380
Every time I went there,

196
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,050
the security
would give me a candy.

197
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,440
That building

198
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,490
is the gym.

199
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,730
It’s super huge.

200
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,960
There’s even a pool in it.

201
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,860
Are these the girls’ dormitories?

202
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,440
Yep.

203
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,010
Which room did you live in?

204
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,370
That one.

205
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,440
But my roommates and I were not close.

206
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,320
My home is in the school, you know.

207
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,290
I spent much time at home.

208
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,130
Is that it?

209
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,410
But I guess there must be other reasons.

210
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,800
It’s just I received more love letters.

211
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,440
And?

212
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,380
And... Sometimes, someone
gave me meals,

213
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,320
tea,

214
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:40,290
gifts.

215
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,200
And?

216
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,010
And...

217
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,320
Maybe someone liked to block my way.

218
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,440
I understand that.

219
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,380
I also had that kind of trouble.

220
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,650
Headache.

221
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,530
-Then how many love letters?
-Then how many love letters?

222
00:10:59,170 --> 00:10:59,920
Not many.

223
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,200
So-so.

224
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,170
Did you take them?

225
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,200
What do you think?

226
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,250
Wait for me!

227
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,200
Wait for me.

228
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,200
Are you still in touch
with some of those people?

229
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,900
What about you?

230
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,290
I wasn’t even in touch with
any of them ever.

231
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,010
I didn’t even take
any of the letters ever.

232
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:30,560
Dad Jiang?

233
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,250
Dad Jiang is over there.

234
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:33,720
Dad Jiang,

235
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,130
what are you doing?

236
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,320
You are back.

237
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,200
This must be Shaoqing.

238
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:41,920
Really handsome.

239
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,170
Even handsomer
than the one on the photo.

240
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:44,960
Nice to meet you, Uncle.

241
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,650
You look even younger
than the one on the photo.

242
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,650
That’s sweet.

243
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,900
No wonder her mom

244
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,560
always speaks highly of you.

245
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,490
Cong Rong always tells me
how much she admires you.

246
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,730
I can even recite all your

247
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,860
heroic deeds backwards fluently.

248
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,570
Heroic deeds? No.

249
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,720
You’re flattering me.

250
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,490
When will you stop
flattering each other?

251
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,290
Dad Jiang,

252
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,440
you even ignored me
after you met him.

253
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,800
We often meet,

254
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:08,530
don’t we?

255
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,410
But this is my first time
to meet my son-in-law.

256
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,290
-We have a lot to talk.
-Yeah.

257
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,720
I agree with you, my father-in-law.

258
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,920
Dad Jiang.

259
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,840
What were you busy with?

260
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,800
When your mom and I married, I buried
two jars of Chinese liquor here.

261
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,340
Today, Shaoqing came.

262
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,410
I want to dig out one jar,

263
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,130
and drink with him at dinner.

264
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,440
But I couldn’t find it.

265
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,050
Buried under this tree or that tree?

266
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,730
Well, I... I’ll continue.

267
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,680
Wait for me.

268
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,560
Why did you bury the liquor
under a tree?

269
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,370
These are osmanthus trees.

270
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,440
So?

271
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,960
The liquor buried under
an osmanthus tree must be Nyu Er Hong.

272
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,650
In ancient China,
a father brew some Chinese liquor

273
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,530
when his daughter
was entering the marriageable age.

274
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,210
When his daughter was getting married,

275
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,570
he dug out the liquor underground

276
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,500
to treat the guests.

277
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,440
The taste was extraordinary.

278
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,680
Your father is digging it out,

279
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,890
which means his daughter
is going to get married.

280
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,530
Don’t gloat only because

281
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,530
he called you son-in-law.

282
00:12:58,530 --> 00:12:59,840
I haven’t said yes.

283
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,250
You will soon.

284
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,290
I found it! I found it!

285
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,890
Great! I found it.

286
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,400
I found it. I found it.

287
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,080
No rush.

288
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,320
Take a look.

289
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,490
This liquor is amazing.

290
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,210
One jar of it will do for today.

291
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,290
The other jar of it

292
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,290
will be drunk at a more important event.

293
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,290
Let’s go.

294
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:20,770
Let’s go home for dinner.

295
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,560
Let’s go home for dinner.

296
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,680
Let’s have a good drink tonight.

297
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,450
Look at Shaoqing’s
cutting and slicing skill.

298
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,220
Impressive.

299
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:36,900
You’re flattering me.

300
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,960
Skill comes from practice.

301
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,140
I just use knives
more often than others.

302
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,380
I get too familiar with them.

303
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,210
That’s right.

304
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,490
He’s a professional butcher.

305
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,970
He’s only good at using knives.

306
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:45,860
How could you say that?

307
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,800
Impolite.

308
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:47,900
What did I tell you?

309
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,680
You can find no one

310
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,220
that has better
cutting and slicing skills than him.

311
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:50,930
I thought

312
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,410
you were the luckiest woman
for marrying me.

313
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:53,370
But check this.

314
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,290
Well,

315
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,290
our daughter

316
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,490
is even luckier than you.

317
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,810
Do you think we should be jealous

318
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,080
or relieved?

319
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,490
Relieved, of course.

320
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,130
However, I still think

321
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,320
my husband is the best man in the world.

322
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,280
Of course!

323
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,320
Be restrained, okay?

324
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,900
This sweet couple always
ignore my feelings.

325
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,650
I’m so miserable.

326
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,800
We’re setting a good example for you.

327
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,840
Come on, sit, sit.

328
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,370
I’ll do it.

329
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,290
Food coming.

330
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:22,920
Uncle, Aunt,

331
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,250
have a check.

332
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,860
Are you satisfied with
Cong Rong’s daily meal standard?

333
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,170
Can’t be more satisfied!

334
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,050
Right?

335
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:28,450
Come on.

336
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,440
Sit, sit.

337
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,280
Now I see,

338
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,260
these two kids are trying to
make us jealous, right?

339
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,340
Considering your performance today,

340
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,680
I’ll give you a score of 120!

341
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:39,530
Hurry, let’s eat.

342
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,220
I’m starving.

343
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:40,570
Okay, okay.

344
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,450
Let’s eat.

345
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,250
Wait!

346
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,170
Wait a sec.

347
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,290
Shaoqing.

348
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:46,960
Here.

349
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,770
From now on, this pair of chopsticks

350
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,770
belongs to you.

351
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,440
Let’s welcome our new family member.

352
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,010
Thanks, Uncle, Aunt.

353
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,170
What are you waiting for?

354
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:55,570
Come on, applaud!

355
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,170
Welcome, welcome!

356
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:58,570
All right.

357
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,290
Sit, sit.

358
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,600
Come on.

359
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,290
Guys, cheers.

360
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:02,920
Cheers.

361
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,600
Hey, you.

362
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,380
Cheers!

363
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,440
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

364
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,200
Shaoqing, a good name,

365
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,930
more importantly, a good person.

366
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,380
He’s not only humble and gentle,

367
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,650
but also talented in cooking.

368
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,890
You’ve seen countless people,

369
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,340
but you’re wrong
about a person this time.

370
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,170
Why?

371
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,600
He’s not humble or gentle.

372
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,100
He’s tactful and sharp-tongued.

373
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,090
A man

374
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,340
needs not only wisdom

375
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,320
but also tactics

376
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,370
to protect the one he loves.

377
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,410
I think Shaoqing

378
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,260
can totally handle it.

379
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:31,690
Yes, that’s right.

380
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,440
I agree.

381
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,530
Your dad is the same kind.

382
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,600
Of course.

383
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Thanks for your appreciation,
Uncle, Aunt.

384
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:36,810
Let’s have a toast.

385
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,410
A toast to you two.

386
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:37,860
Cheers.

387
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,440
Okay, okay.

388
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:38,980
Cheers.

389
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,010
We have confidence in you.

390
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:43,570
Come on.

391
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,140
Another drink.

392
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,130
Fill it up. Come on.

393
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,220
Dad,

394
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:46,860
don’t drink too much.

395
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,860
You still have work to do tomorrow.

396
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,290
That’s no big deal.

397
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,290
Are you...? Protecting me

398
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,890
or him?

399
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,140
A man

400
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,290
can’t drink too little.

401
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,290
What’s big deal of getting drunk?

402
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,980
The way a man drinks
reflects his character.

403
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,920
Right?

404
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,570
Shaoqing is a good man.

405
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,020
Huh?

406
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,970
Of course!

407
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,260
Look how happy your dad is.

408
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:03,770
Cheers.

409
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:04,600
A toast on his behalf!

410
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:06,920
That’s better.

411
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,410
Let me fill your cup up.

412
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,290
Your cup.

413
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,170
Let me fill it up.

414
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,200
Dad!

415
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,130
Mom!

416
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,770
What?

417
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:18,440
He’s fine.

418
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:18,860
He can still drink.

419
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,290
Be good.

420
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,490
Be good, dear.

421
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,160
Look how happy your dad is.

422
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,840
Right?

423
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,200
Shaoqing,

424
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,680
do you know why I brew the Nyu Er Hong?

425
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,410
I’m from Shaoxing,
that liquor’s hometown.

426
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,080
As the saying goes in Shaoxing,

427
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,800
“The liquor brewed by using
the water from the local lake

428
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,960
can even be smelled
by people from another town.”

429
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,330
When my younger sister was born,

430
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,330
my father brewed a few jars
of Nyu Er Hong.

431
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,170
I was too young

432
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,800
to understand my father.

433
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,320
Until later, Rong came into my life,

434
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,320
I understood him.

435
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,200
You know her life experience, right?

436
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,130
I know.

437
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,290
For these years,

438
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,010
we didn’t give birth to another child.

439
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,840
Because in our heart,

440
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,690
Rong is our only beloved daughter.

441
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:18,930
So,

442
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,690
I wouldn’t allow you to hurt her.

443
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,840
Actually, the bond between me and her

444
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,010
began much earlier
than Aunt and you know.

445
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,210
Holding her hand again

446
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,560
is really a blessing for me.

447
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,730
After so many years,

448
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,010
we met again.

449
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,050
I will never hurt her.

450
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,690
Being by her side

451
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,010
is happy, right?

452
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:53,930
Yeah.

453
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,730
It’s hard to describe,

454
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:02,970
but I feel each day
is given a different meaning.

455
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,230
Cong Rong is like...

456
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,760
A clock pendulum.

457
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,210
Every day, she takes me
with her, swinging.

458
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,360
Every second is different.

459
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,490
Uncle,

460
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,930
it feels amazing.

461
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,730
I know, I know.

462
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,720
I was young once.
I’ve been through this.

463
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,360
Couldn’t help loving.

464
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,930
Still the same now.

465
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,800
If I may,

466
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,970
I want to hold her hand forever,

467
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,450
never letting go.

468
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:54,530
Uncle.

469
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,930
I don’t know what could happen
in the future,

470
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,080
but please trust me,

471
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,970
Cong Rong is the first priority
of my life.

472
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,970
I hope you can feel at ease
letting her be with me.

473
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,160
I will protect her well.

474
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,640
You are her choice.

475
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,880
I respect her choice.

476
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,160
As parents, we don’t want much.

477
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,730
We only want you

478
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,490
to be happy.

479
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,120
I’ll take a walk,

480
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,360
and enjoy the breeze.

481
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,140
Careful.

482
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:34,930
Sure.

483
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,820
How could my dad

484
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,880
let you drink so much?

485
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,320
Are you clear-headed?

486
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,450
Yes!

487
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:01,930
Careful.

488
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:02,600
Careful.

489
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:03,930
Lift your feet.

490
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:08,970
You drank too much.

491
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,210
I want to sleep there.

492
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,160
You passed the guest room.

493
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,930
Wait, this is my bedroom.

494
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,290
You’d better go sleep in the guest room.

495
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,970
My parents will come back soon.

What are you afraid of?

499
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,730
Drunkenness is medically called
alcoholic intoxication,

500
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,930
which can cause
nervous system abnormalities

501
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,640
and blood circulation disturbance.

502
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,490
And loss of ability to commit crimes.

503
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,320
I’m really drunk.

504
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,320
That’s yellow rice wine.

505
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,010
It has a strong delayed effect.

506
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,840
I told you to drink less.

507
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,450
He was testing his son-in-law’s
drinking capacity.

508
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,530
I had to drink.

Let’s go check Shaoqing

521
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,640
to see if he’s recovered from the drink.

522
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,780
His drinking capacity is not bad.

523
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,450
It’s your fault.

524
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,010
Now we can’t explain it.

525
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,730
Calm down.

526
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,880
I need your collaboration.

527
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,820
Where are the kids?

528
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,530
I also wanna know.

529
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,770
You are back, Uncle, Aunt.

530
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,130
Well, Cong Rong felt uncomfortable.

531
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,160
So, I brought her here to take a rest.

532
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,820
Something must be wrong
with your liquor.

533
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,850
Let me see.

534
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,440
Nothing can be wrong with my liquor.

535
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,100
Shaoqing,

536
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,010
are you all right?

537
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,860
I also have a headache.

538
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,530
Why is it red here?

539
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,530
Are you allergic to the liquor?

540
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,620
Yes, yes, yes.

541
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,370
Yeah.

542
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,690
That... That sounds right.

543
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,690
Sounds right.

544
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,380
Yes, yes, yes.

545
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,290
She’s allergic.

546
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,930
I’ll get you some water then.

547
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,210
Something must be wrong

548
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,290
with your liquor!

549
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,200
Liquor?

550
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,880
Nothing can be wrong with my liquor.

551
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,210
Liquor...

552
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,330
Dad.

553
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,200
Don’t worry.

554
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,160
I’ll take a walk with him.

555
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:25,930
Yeah.

556
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,320
Liquor?

557
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,530
What’s this place?

558
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,360
Looks a little romantic.

559
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,730
Every school has this kind of place

560
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,490
for young lovers.

561
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,210
So, you came here before
with your adorers?

562
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,290
Impossible.

563
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,690
This is my first time to come here.

564
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,610
Really?

565
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:50,450
What a coincidence.

566
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,800
This is also my first time.

567
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,610
Do you know what I told your dad?

568
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,400
Huh?

569
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,250
Finally, I found you.

570
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,690
I don’t want to be separated
from you for a second.

571
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,120
Okay.

572
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,450
Go in.

573
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,380
Go in.

574
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,530
It’s loading.

575
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:37,450
I couldn’t hit him.

576
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,290

We’ve landed.

595
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,210
What time is it?

596
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,420
<i>Zhong Zhen</i>

597
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,530
Zhong Zhen?

598
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,450
Rong,

599
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,800
are you with Boss?

600
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,160
Looking for him again.

601
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:03,900
What is it?

602
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,640
Speak.

603
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,860
Terrible news!

604
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,770
The family of the patient in Bed Three
has sued the hospital

605
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,340
and... Boss!

606
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,360
What?

607
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,260
<i>Grandma</i>

608
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,120
Seems I’m going to be scolded.

609
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,120
You’re here.

610
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,050
Why are you also here?

611
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,640
Your grandma misses me.

612
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,250
She called me back to have dinner.

613
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,210
They have known that I’ve been sued

614
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:52,880
and are going to interrogate me?

615
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,490
I’m afraid you have to
transcribe a book.

616
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,300
I’ve prepared it for you.

617
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,400
Compendium of Materia Medica.

618
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,970
After you’re done,
give them back to me within a month.

619
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:05,880
Good.

620
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,320
Speed up your speaking speed.

621
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,010
Use long sentences
instead of short ones.

622
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,570
Don’t act like a parent

623
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,440
in front of me.

624
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,380
Yes,

625
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,450
Father.

626
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,300
He’s educating his own son.

627
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,130
Why do you have to set foot in?

628
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,090
What?

629
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,450
I’m also a dad here.

630
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,360
I can’t educate my own son?

631
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,410
Daddy,

632
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,120
eat.

633
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,370
Come play chess with your younger son!

634
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:34,250
Let’s go!

635
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,410
Come on, let’s go.

636
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,320
You naughty kid.

637
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,010
Dad.

638
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,290
The director has told you?

639
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:43,450
Yes.

640
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,640
Did you get hurt?

641
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:46,930
Just a little.

642
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,290
I’m all right now.

643
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,800
What’s the punishment?

644
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:51,930
I’m suspended.

645
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,530
For how long?

646
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:56,690
It depends.

647
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,560
I heard this incident is huge.

648
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,640
Some reports are unfair.

649
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,800
Adjust your mentality well

650
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,050
and be cooperative with
the hospital’s investigation.

651
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,290
I don’t care about those reports.

652
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,800
There’s just a disorderly crowd.

653
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:14,450
They’re just venting their emotions.

654
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,530
Good to know you understand that.

655
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:18,380
Dad,

656
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,450
aren’t you going to blame me?

657
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:20,600
As a father,

658
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,120
I won’t encourage my son to fight.

659
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,120
As a senior,

660
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,640
I won’t encourage a junior
to fight, either.

661
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,120
But as a doctor,

662
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,400
I don’t think you made a big mistake.

663
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,320
However, you must remember

664
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,800
that you are from the Wen family.

665
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,250
Many people are observing.

666
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,120
I can’t be biased in your favor.

667
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,160
I was being impulsive.

668
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,100
I won’t make the same mistake again.

669
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,490
Have a good rest then.

670
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,160
Take it as an opportunity
to improve yourself.

671
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,690
Improve what?

672
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,250
Shaoqing has been good enough.

673
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,970
He doesn’t make me worried like you do.

674
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,380
Don’t give the kid too much pressure.

675
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,050
He’s still got dinner to have.

676
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,640
Mom,

677
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,060
I wasn’t scolding him.

678
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,360
I was just educating him.

679
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,300
Anyway, I’m so far away now.

680
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,690
I can’t do anything to him.

681
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,210
It’s good you know.

682
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,170
I’ll hang up.

683
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:15,490
Mom.

684
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,050
You...

685
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,250
Your dad is old.

686
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:20,450
Likes nagging.

687
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,450
Grandma,

688
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,160
let me give you a hand.

689
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:24,970
Take it.

690
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,140
What do you mean by this, Grandma?

691
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,010
I’m not short of money.

692
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,530
I know you’re not.

693
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,970
This is your... Travelling fund.

694
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,140
You rarely have a chance
to take a long rest.

695
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,160
Don’t just stay at home.

696
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,970
Go travelling the world.

697
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,930
Take your girlfriend with you.

698
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,210
She has to go to work.

699
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:46,880
Grandma,

700
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,400
I know you feel sorry for me.

701
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:50,530
It’s okay.

702
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,530
The suspension won’t be long.

703
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,560
Shaoqing,

704
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,320
as an old woman,

705
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,780
when I look back what I’ve been through,

706
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,730
I find most difficulties
no longer difficult.

707
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,210
Don’t be too hard on yourself.

708
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,050
Enjoy the pleasures life affords.

709
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,120
Also, enjoy the bitterness life affords.

710
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,160
Understand?

711
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,640
Understand.

712
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,800
These strawberries smell really good.

713
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,140
I grew them in our yard.

714
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,050
Just eat.

715
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,930
It’s dirty.

716
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:19,970
It’s sweet.

717
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,300
Do you like the dishes I cooked?

718
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,060
Of course!

719
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,560
I love the food you cook the most.

720
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,100
Good.

721
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,730
Come to eat more often then.

722
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,250
Sure.

723
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,530
Here’s some sesame paste.

724
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,210
It’s for my future granddaughter-in-law.

725
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,160
Thanks, Grandma.

726
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,930
I promise I will marry her.

727
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,600
I can’t let her taste your food
for nothing.

728
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,210
We’re both waiting for that.

729
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:42,880
Sure.

730
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:44,820
These are

731
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,930
a few dishes Chengcheng loves.

732
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,300
I won’t take them.

733
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,290
They would be a waste.

734
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,290
You...

735
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:52,820
Dad!

736
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,840
You brat.

737
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,930
Have you quarreled with Chengcheng?

738
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,530
Take them.

739
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,250
Use them as an apology.

740
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,100
That’s right.

741
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,580
Take them.

742
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,060
Hurry, take them.

743
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,900
You know nothing

744
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,300
but still want me to apologize.

745
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,730
It must be your fault.

746
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:07,840
That’s right.

747
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,530
Be good to her.

748
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,890
You’ve finally got a girl
that likes you.

749
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,250
Cherish her.

750
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,360
I know.

751
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:15,930
I’m leaving, Mom.

752
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,080
Just leave.

753
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:17,930
Grandpa, Grandma,

754
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:18,730
I’ll visit you another day.

755
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,300
Be safe on the way.

756
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,050
Bye, Mom.

757
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:23,720
You’re grow-up
but still make us worried.

758
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,450
You...

759
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:27,530
What?

760
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,560
You were dumped?

761
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,080
Why don’t you take them?

762
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:33,970
Sure.

763
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,930
No way.

764
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:37,290
I...!

765
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,690
Haven’t taught you a lesson lately.

766
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,290
Now you’re this bold?

767
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,730
Fine, fine.

768
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,010
Do you think I’m stupid?

769
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:53,560
Honestly speaking,

770
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,210
very stupid.

771
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,730
You wanna die?

772
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:57,300
Are you done?

773
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,120
Enough.

774
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:11,820
Is it good?

775
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,450
Yeah!

776
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,450
My grandma made it by herself.

777
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,140
It’s made of walnut,

778
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:16,880
Chinese date,

779
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:17,690
and...

780
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,880
And she said in particular that

781
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:23,400
it’s for her granddaughter-in-law.

782
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,400
I shouldn’t have been worried about you.

783
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,440
Seems you didn’t get scolded at home.

784
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,160
I thought your whole family
was so strict on you.

785
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:34,800
Grandparents spoil grandkids,
don’t you know?

786
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,890
Not to mention I’ve been
well-behaved since little.

787
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,080
My grandparents really spoil me.

788
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,800
Convey my thanks to Grandma.

789
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,290
I’ve got gourmet’s luck.

790
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,400
Eat more if you like it.

791
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:50,320
I think the color of your hair
is a bit of strange.

792
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,680
I dyed it specially, alright?

793
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,800
It cost much.

794
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,120
And you often lose your hair.

795
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,780
Every time after you left

796
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,580
my place,

797
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,080
your hair would be everywhere.

798
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,880
I once thought Rangyirang’s hair
turned dark.

799
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,400
You’re a dog!

800
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:06,600
Don’t move.

801
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,450
Don’t move.

802
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,400
Done.

803
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,050
How about letting my law firm take up

804
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:42,840
your case?

805
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,400
Good.

806
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,730
Let me get this straight.

807
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,730
You and I are going to be
lawyer and party soon.

808
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:57,930
You must watch every manner of yours.

809
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,970
You can’t let me
violate my professional ethics.

810
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,640
That complicated?

811
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,840
What about after the case?

812
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:06,930
After?

813
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,050
Who knows?

814
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,560
What do you mean?

815
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,820
When you are my party,

816
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,700
I must treat you fairly.

817
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,890
But when you’re not,
I won’t have to do that anymore.

818
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,340
Is there really a law against

819
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,010
the romantic relationship
between a lawyer and a party?

820
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,810
Article 60 of Chapter VI of the Law
of the People’s Republic of China

821
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,810
on Lawyers stipulates that

822
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,970
any person who has
an improper relationship

823
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:45,300
with a party by providing legal services

824
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,730
shall be warned by
the judicial administrative department.

825
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:48,930
If the circumstances are serious,

826
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:51,120
he shall be suspended
from practicing for three months.

827
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,660
Really?

828
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,410
Yeah.

829
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,850
Miss Cong,

830
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,680
you made up that law, right?

831
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,850
You’re bullying an ignorant citizen.

832
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:19,480
Yes!

833
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,930
I’m bullying you ignorant of laws.

834
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,580
<i>Chen Cu</i>

835
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,410
Bro,

836
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:34,120
I just attended a meeting
with the leaderships.

837
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,200
Call me back when you have time.

838
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,820
Let me get you another bowl of it.

839
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,810
I still have some at my place.

840
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,810
Wait here.

841
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:13,370
Bro.

842
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:14,530
I’m sorry.

843
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,370
I didn’t expect you would be involved.

844
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,120
That’s my patient.

845
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,720
Don’t say that.

846
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,200
I didn’t do it for you.

847
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,260
Director Yan wants you to come
to the hospital when you have time.

848
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,850
He’ll tell you the details.

849
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:30,850
I get it.

850
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:32,640
Did...?

851
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:36,530
Did they mention the reinstatement
at the meeting?

852
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,010
No, they didn’t.

853
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,450
Let’s first settle the problems at hand.

854
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,050
Okay.

855
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,280
I get it.

856
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,080
What?

857
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,850
You can’t wait to eat?

858
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,280
Even for a minute?

859
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,010
I’ll coordinate the case
as soon as I get to the office.

860
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,410
Trust me.

861
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,450
I

862
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,240
will help you out.
