<i>My Little Happiness</i>

30
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:43,020
<i>Episode 21</i>

31
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,840
Thanks, bro.

32
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,550
When will I attend your wedding, huh?

33
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,830
Happy wedding.

34
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,710
I’ll take my leave.

35
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,430
Catch you later.

36
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,910
Wen Rang!

37
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,070
You’re leaving so soon?

38
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,100
Won’t you join the following activities?

39
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,660
Not today.

40
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,230
Several major booksellers

41
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,590
are also present at the wedding.

42
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,560
There’s still time.

43
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,710
I can introduce you to them,

44
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,310
so that your poems can

45
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,670
be on the bookshelves
at major bookstores.

46
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,900
We can discuss that another day.

47
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,780
Wen Rang.

48
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,780
This is a rare opportunity.

49
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,180
If your poems are seen by more people,

50
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,360
so will be your literary talent.

51
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,990
Don’t you expect that to happen?

52
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,510
Thanks for your concern.

53
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,950
But I don’t expect that to happen.

54
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:36,990
Wen Rang.

55
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,740
Now you’re cold to me

56
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,270
because of her?

57
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,580
Jiang Yao.

58
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,230
You always think yourself in the right.

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,310
Take a picture of me.

60
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,620
My friends are gonna like it.

61
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,990
No problem. Go ahead.

62
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,110
I’ll take more pictures.

63
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,670
Pose over here.

64
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,150
I keep recording your everyday life

65
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,560
and posting the videos on WeSee.

66
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,740
Now you have
several hundred thousand followers.

67
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,120
Look, guys.

68
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,270
I specially cooked it for him.

69
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,230
Do you think after he tastes it,

70
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,180
he’ll ask me to be his girlfriend?

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,580
The world even seems smaller.

72
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,230
I didn’t know he could do rock climbing.

73
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,800
We both have 24 hours a day.

74
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,310
But the things he can do in 24 hours

75
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,460
are even more than
what I can do in 48 hours.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,190
Really admire him.

77
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,260
How industrious he is!

78
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,950
Do you think if I go

79
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,350
help him with the cleaning,

80
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,150
he’ll ask me to be his girlfriend?

81
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,350
He’s cleaning the bookshelves.

82
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,510
Don’t walk away.

83
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,470
Look here.

84
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,540
Let me interview you.

85
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,660
How many times a day do you clean them?

86
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,030
Once is enough if you’re not here.

87
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,940
How many times is it if I’m here?

88
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,870
Four or five.

89
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,160
But why?

90
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,310
I never give you more trouble.

91
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,510
Don’t try to run!

92
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,270
Chickens.

93
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,460
Bear. Bear.

94
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,540
I wanna play with you.

95
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,030
Sure.

96
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,560
Do you want to see bubbles,

97
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,430
kids?

98
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,910
Yes!

99
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,070
Still so carefree.

100
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,710
Her sorrow never lasts
longer than a day.

101
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,390
That’s good.

102
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,540
I don’t need to be worried.

103
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,830
Be careful. Don’t burst them.

104
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,710
Be careful. Don’t burst them.

105
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,430
Mommy,

106
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,540
I wanna fly a kite.

107
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,910
It’s run out.

108
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,830
How about this?

109
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,440
Fly a kite in the park tomorrow, okay?

110
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,150
Okay.

111
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,860
Okay.

112
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,390
Why did you stop?

113
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,200
The bubble water has run out.

114
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,240
I’ll go get some.

115
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,860
You guys go play over there, okay?

116
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,270
-Okay.
-Okay.

117
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,920
I’m running.

118
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,320
Hey, let go of the kite.

119
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,120
I’m doing it. I’m doing it.

120
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,390
Let go when the wind blows.

121
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,350
Three, two…

122
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:07,000
<i>Inpatient Department</i>

123
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,620
Here we are.

124
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,740
Thanks,

125
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,660
my private driver.

126
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:11,950
How are you feeling

127
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,420
about having your girlfriend
drive you to work?

128
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,660
Feeling great.

129
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,780
Hope we can do this every day.

130
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,740
Does it still hurt?

131
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,870
Having your tender care,

132
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,830
I recovered long ago.

133
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,420
Don’t push yourself too hard.

134
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,360
Those families of that patient

135
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,540
must still be at the hospital.

136
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,350
I worry they may give you a hard time.

137
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,030
<i>Legal Assistant Cong Rong</i>
If they badger with you,

138
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,180
let them come to me.

139
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,350
I get it.

140
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,070
I can feel your strong desire
to protect me.

141
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,430
All right.

142
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,300
I gotta go to work.

143
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,470
Careful on the road.

144
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,390
Please don’t stand here

145
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,340
and affect our work.

146
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,120
Is Wen Shaoqing a doctor
in your hospital?

147
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,470
It’s said that
he hit the patient’s family yesterday.

148
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,680
Is that true?

149
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,680
Do you support his deed?

150
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,710
We want to interview him.

151
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,030
Can you ask Wen Shaoqing to come here?

152
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:11,470
Can you ask him…?

153
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,040
-Boss, don’t go there.
-To tell us the details?

154
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,200
Why are there so many journalists?

155
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,880
Don’t bring it up.

156
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,980
It’s a total mess now.

157
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,780
That patient’s families
contacted several media.

158
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,150
They all want to interview you.

159
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,270
Look how eager they are.

160
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,830
You mustn’t give them the chance.

161
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,420
The problem must be solved.

162
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,030
I can’t escape all the time.

163
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,070
Forget about the things here for now.

164
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,740
Think about
how to deal with the Director.

165
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:33,710
Sorry.

166
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,350
We aren’t available for an interview
right now.

167
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,590
I told you, we aren’t available…
It’s you.

168
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,590
You must stop them, understand?

169
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,710
Tell them

170
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,200
that the hospital will give them
an explanation soon.

171
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,950
Director.

172
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,710
You know what?

173
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,870
I’ve been busy with nothing

174
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,030
but the calls.

175
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,350
How could you get involved in a fight?

176
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,640
If in any case you got your hand hurt

177
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,560
and couldn’t operate anymore,

178
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,830
your career and future
would both be ruined, right?

179
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,430
It’s never easy for a hospital

180
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,030
to train a good doctor.

181
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,790
If you are a responsible man,

182
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,750
the first thing you should do
is to protect yourself.

183
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,830
I just didn’t want to let those kids down.

184
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:16,430
Well,

185
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,220
this is my fault.

186
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,100
I hope you won’t punish them.

187
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,470
This is no big deal.

188
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,670
The hospital will
deal with them accordingly.

189
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,220
Then be simple

190
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,310
and tell me the punishment for me.

191
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,710
Go home and rest for a few days.

192
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,430
The hospital will deal with
the patient in Bed Three and the media.

193
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,950
Wait till this is over.

194
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,950
How many days exactly?

195
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,140
At least a month.

196
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,310
Boss,

197
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,790
what’s their decision?

198
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,200
Dr. Wen,

199
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,230
the patient in Bed 15 doesn’t feel good.

200
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,670
Please have a check.

201
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:11,520
I’m on suspension.

202
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,880
I can’t see a patient.

203
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:17,920
Chen Cu.

204
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,490
Please take over my job.

205
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,210
I should’ve been the one
to take the responsibility.

206
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,330
Don’t say that.

207
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,250
This is my fault.

208
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,040
The one deserving punishment is me.

209
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,250
I won’t be there with you
on the night shifts lately.

210
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:33,880
Don’t miss me too much.

211
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,890
Go.

212
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:37,970
The patient is waiting.

213
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,520
Okay.

214
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:43,490
Let’s go.

215
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,120
What?

216
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,370
Don’t give me those sad faces.

217
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,330
I’m just suspended, not fired.

218
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,640
I’ll be back.

219
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:55,920
All get back to your work.

220
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,930
Or the director will scold you again.

221
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,330
We were all involved.

222
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,250
Why did you take all the punishment?

223
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,120
You’re still young.

224
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,800
You’ll understand in the future.

225
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:07,690
By the way,

226
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,610
I’ve made a call to your teacher.

227
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,690
Write a self-criticism later.

228
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,280
The school won’t be hard on you.

229
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,250
One more thing.

230
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,370
I’m writing down
all the important matters

231
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,370
needing attention

232
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,610
of several patients.

233
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,650
Director,

234
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,250
don’t punish those interns, please.

235
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,210
With more and more doctors getting old,

236
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,340
we need more and more

237
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,850
young doctors to become pillars.

238
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,850
<i>Matters needing attention of patients</i>

239
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,090
Do as I have written down.

240
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,120
Don’t make any mistakes.

241
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,490
Why are you still standing there?

242
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,730
Get back to what you should do!

243
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,170
When in that white coat,

244
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:47,970
you’re entrusted with

245
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:48,920
the patient’s health and life.

246
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,280
Bear it in mind.

247
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,040
You may leave.

248
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:55,920
I also should…

249
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,570
Leave for home.

250
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:04,840
Boss,

251
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,850
we’ll wait for you to come back.

252
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,210
You came back early today.

253
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,490
Zhong Zhen told me that you’re…

254
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,250
On suspension.

255
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,120
You look like you’re going to a war.

256
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,450
Let’s take it as a vacation,

257
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,730
to which I’ve been looking forward.

258
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:41,520
Come on.

259
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,450
Let’s eat.

260
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,520
Are you sure?

261
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,370
Are you sure you’re not worried at all?

262
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,850
Why should I be worried?

263
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,730
My life has been so boring.

264
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,370
Most of my time has been taken up
by the patients and the hospital.

265
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,040
Only a little belongs to myself.

266
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,640
Now is good.

267
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,930
I finally have time to enjoy my life

268
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:04,940
and finish my list.

269
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,000
You have a list?

270
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,920
Of course I have things I wanna do.

271
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,700
Are they weird things like
carving patterns on chopsticks

272
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,420
or working on the best way
to kill a chicken

273
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,760
for the best taste, etc.?

274
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,090
Working on a recipe
is interesting indeed.

275
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,640
But I have a more important thing to do.

276
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,090
Being with you.

277
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,160
But now,

278
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,890
what you should do is to taste

279
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:27,120
the meal cooked by a weird chef.

280
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:31,970
This one.

281
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:32,650
Newly developed by me.

282
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,280
Delicious!

283
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:35,970
You too have a bite.

284
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,280
Chengcheng.

285
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,100
I didn’t expect it to be so popular.

286
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:47,960
You must be tired.

287
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,730
I’m fine.

288
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,450
Here are your wages.

289
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,490
These are your due.

290
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,770
Thanks a lot.

291
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:53,530

But the truth is some boat

It’s okay.

329

As long as you’re back.

330
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,690
You won’t even ask
why I suddenly came back?

331
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,360
No need to ask.

332
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,930
I know you’ve been
suffering a lot outside.

00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,970
Home is good, isn’t it?

334
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,930
I’m such a failure, don’t you think?

335
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,040
I just want to run my own small business

336
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,650
and earn my own bread.

337
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,130
Why does it have to be so hard?

338
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,020
You want to be
independent and self-reliant.

339
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,280
There’s nothing wrong about that.

340
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,450
Your mom and I support you.

341
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,490
But some things in life
just don’t suit you.

342
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,210
Don’t suit me?

343
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,250
Right.

344
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,840
He and I are not from the same world.

345
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,970
How can we suit each other?

346
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:33,930
Chengcheng,

347
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:34,970
what’re you talking about?

348
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,360
Did someone hurt you?

349
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,130
No.

350
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,170
It was my fault

351
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,840
to let you and Mom down.

352
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:54,450
In fact, sometimes it’s our fault.

353
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,320
From now on, as long as you’re happy,

354
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,930
you’ll have our full support.

355
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,970
There’s no big deal.

356
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,560
Let’s take our time.

357
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,490
Yeah.

What a hearty breakfast!

362
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,970
Nutritionally speaking,

363
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,410
a healthy breakfast should have

364
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,130
four to five hundred calories.

365
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,210
There should be an appropriate
amount of carbohydrate,

366
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,760
protein, vitamin and mineral substance.

367
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,280
So that you can have enough energy
for the whole morning.

368
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,320
You got up early

369
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,650
only to make me breakfast?

370
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,730
That’s not the whole truth.

371
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,320
I also made you lunch, dinner
and night snack.

00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,760
Don’t forget to take them.

373
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,160
Are you going to be a full-time chef?

374
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,010
You lawyers often skip meals
when being busy

375
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:31,280
and casually order takeout

376
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,560
which contains little nutrition.

377
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:33,580
Now is good.

378
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,360
I have plenty of time

379
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,280
to cook for you.

380
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,410
Lately, you’ve been busy with
that online loan case

381
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,570
and always work overtime.

382
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,520
You may get hungry at night,

383
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,320
so I’ve prepared more food for you.

384
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,050
You’re so good to me

385
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,040
that I don’t even know how to repay you.

386
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,650
You can marry me.

387
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,060
Time for work.

388
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:53,890
I gotta go.

389
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,980
Go on enjoying your retire life.

390
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,930
I’m leaving for work.

391
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,650
I’ll walk you out.

392
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,810
Stay at home and have a good rest.

393
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,690
No need to walk me out.

394
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,800
Then I won’t walk you downstairs.

395
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:14,730
I’m off.

396
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,450
You lied.

397
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,320
I pushed the button for you.

398
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,650
Don’t thank me.

399
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,250
A walk after eating helps digestion.

400
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,800
I’ll walk you to the bus station.

401
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,560
Let’s have an outing when I’m less busy.

402
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,600
Good.

403
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:44,650
Where do you want to go?

404
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,080
How about going to see animals?

405
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,490
Elephant.

406
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,760
Goat.

407
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:51,970
Swallow.

408
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:52,690
Look.

409
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:53,740
Looks like a swallow?

410
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,360
Yeah.

411
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,170
A rabbit?

412
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,650
A rabbit.

413
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,360
It doesn’t look like a rabbit.

414
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,730
A rabbit should look like this.

415
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,280
Huh?

416
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,490
Right?

417
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:05,760
Right indeed.

418
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,360
You should go back.

419
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:15,440
I’ve been too busy lately.

420
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,610
You should go to bed early.

421
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:17,520
Don’t wait for me.

422
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,650
How about walking me farther?

423
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,650
Sure.

424
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,000
Last time,

425
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,210
you were on purpose, right?

426
00:23:58,450 --> 00:23:59,210
What last time?

427
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,250
I don’t remember a thing.

428
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:08,980
<i>East</i>

429
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:09,980
That’s it.

430
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,730
You should go back.

431
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,450
You agreed to walk me
only to the front of the building.

432
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,000
Then I’ll go back.

433
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,730
Remember to eat on time.

434
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,800
Eight. Still early.

435
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,440
Wen Rang.

436
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,520
I can see that

437
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,170
you’re going against yourself.

438
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,250
You have an interesting soul.

439
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,040
You have great talents as well.

440
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,540
What’s more, I think you are

441
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,000
a very, very good person.

442
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:02,890
Don’t deny yourself

443
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,000
because she doesn’t understand you.

444
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:18,680
Hello?

445
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,410
Hello.

446
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,050
Am I speaking to Mr. Wen Rang?

447
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:21,370
Yes,

448
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,020
you are.

449
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,970
What can I do for you?

450
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,100
The venue for your book sharing session
has been settled.

451
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,280
What book sharing session?

452
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,780
About the book A Castle in the Clouds.

453
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,650
Miss Jiang Yao told me to contact you.

454
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,600
So, when are you available this week?

455
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:35,850
Okay,

456
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:36,890
I’ll call you when I confirm.

457
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:37,280
Okay.

458
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,900
<i>Rang Kai Bookstore</i>

459
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:12,730
Cheers.

460
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,840
I didn’t expect the performance
to be so successful

461
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,050
and us to be so appreciated.

462
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:18,970
I’m so happy.

463
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:23,170
It’s because that our female vocal
looks beautiful

464
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,250
and sings well.

465
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,360
Isn’t because that our guitar player

466
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,040
is handsome and talented?

467
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,130
Eat.

468
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:30,730
I gotta say

469
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,890
time really flies.

470
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,320
It’s been two years.

471
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,130
Do you still remember how we met?

472
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,280
Of course I do.

473
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,570
I remember that you were

474
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,020
wearing similar clothes.

475
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,850
You were playing the guitar
near the school garden

476
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,130
with so many girls surrounding

477
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:46,650
and admiring you.

478
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,410
I remember you began to sing

479
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,970
while I was playing the guitar.

480
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,740
You were wearing a red dress

481
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,000
and being eye-catching in the crowd.

482
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:59,610
So, I was wondering

483
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:00,930
who

484
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,520
this proud girl was.

485
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,600
But she sang really well.

486
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:10,560
So, you lost your heart to me
at that moment?

487
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,040
Yes.

488
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:15,930
Fine.

489
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,970
To celebrate the second anniversary
of your losing your heart to me,

490
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:21,850
I have a gift for you.

491
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:22,690
Close your eyes.

492
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,690
Don’t peek.

493
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,490
I won’t.

494
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,280
Hurry.

495
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,650
Open your eyes.

496
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:41,930
Is it for me?

497
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,320
Open it.

498
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,130
Come on, open it.

499
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,210
This brand is expensive!

500
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,250
Where did you get the money?

501
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,130
Tell me, where did you get the money?

502
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,280
I worked part-time for months!

503
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,130
Wen Rang.

504
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,840
Do you like it or not?

505
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:11,610
I… I’m telling you.

506
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,170
It… It is not an ordinary guitar.

507
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,170
It is special.

508
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:14,690
Look.

509
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,520
Look here.

510
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,600
My surname’s initial is here.

511
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,320
This guitar represents me.

512
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,740
Having it by your side

513
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,450
roughly equals having me by your side.

514
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:26,540
Do you have to leave?

515
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,360
I can’t give up a bigger world

516
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,360
because of one person, right?

517
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:31,840
What bigger world?

518
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,080
We’ve been together for years.

519
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,170
You always tell me that
you like the way

520
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,170
I’m being stubborn

521
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,360
and retaining my dignity instead of
succumbing to a temptation.

522
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,930
I’ve been grateful to you.

523
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,930
Grateful to that girl

524
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,020
who worked hard for months

525
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,640
just to buy me a nice guitar.

526
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,210
Just tell yourself that girl is dead.

527
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,560
I was young and ignorant.

528
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,520
In my eyes, there was only the guitar,

529
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:53,650
the songs

530
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:54,970
and you.

531
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,450
Now I’ve changed.

532
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,490
I want more,

533
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,000
which you can’t give me.

534
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:18,650
Turn on the lights!

535
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:19,650
What’s going on?

536
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,130
Be careful.

537
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,040
Check the lights over there.

538
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,930
Why are you here?

539
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:47,760
Jiang Yao.

540
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:51,890
I’m here to return the guitar.

541
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,320
Don’t you remember the meaning of it?

542
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,280
Just because I remember it clearly,

543
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,760
I have to return it to you.

544
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,540
You don’t want to sell your books
by string-pulling.

545
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,130
That’s fine.

546
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,490
I’m holding this book fair for you,

547
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,450
to give your work a chance
to win others’ favor.

548
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,970
Are you still not satisfied?

549
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:14,890
Do you have to use this book fair as…?

550
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,970
Jiang Yao, you know
it’s not about the book fair.

551
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,320
It’s time for us to
end this and move on.

552
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:28,080
I was wishing you to come back
to me while hating you.

553
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,600
That’s a stupid thing I did
when I was young.

554
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,410
I had been doing that stupid thing

555
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,000
till I saw you again.

556
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:37,800
I regretted

557
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:40,520
and rued.

558
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,000
However, I eventually realized that

559
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,800
my emotions for you
were just my obsession.

560
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,280
Obsession with the past

561
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:53,250
is meaningless.

562
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:59,080
Isn’t our past your everything?

563
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:01,040
You once said

564
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,740
that you would always remember
that girl in a red dress

565
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,600
singing in the crowd.

566
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,690
You once said

567
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,280
that’s your fleeting glimpse
of an enchanting beauty.

568
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,540
You got excited
every time you talked about that.

569
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,740
You forgot all of that?

570
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,820
That’s all meaningless to you?

571
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,690
Jiang Yao!

572
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,520
You are no longer the girl
you used to be.

573
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,930
Even I, who always believe that

574
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,360
I would never be changed by this world,

575
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,450
have unknowingly

576
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:33,490
changed.

577
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:35,970
I’ve been asking myself

578
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,800
if I came back too late.

579
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,280
If I came back earlier,

580
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:43,970
we could’ve made it up,

581
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,250
we could’ve gone back…

582
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,930
I asked myself the similar question.

583
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,130
If we did it all over again,

584
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,970
would it be different?

585
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,360
Maybe yes.

586
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,170
But people are stubborn

587
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,360
when they are young.

588
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:08,840
No one would change for the other.

589
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,210
We have only one chance
to make a choice.

590
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,250
We both made the wrong choice.

591
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:24,930
Thank you.

592
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:25,540
Madam.

593
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,810
I want to buy that glass fish

594
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:27,520
I saw last time.

595
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,500
These are all I have.

596
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,250
Take your pick.

597
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,060
This one?

598
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:33,890
You sure?

599
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:34,730
Yeah.

600
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,970
I won’t make the wrong choice this time.

601
00:33:58,930 --> 00:33:59,730
What?

602
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,690
Still reading the court records?

603
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,050
Yeah.

604
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,740
I’m learning about the trial procedures

605
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,840
of these two presiding judges.

606
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,360
I’ve got to be prepared.

607
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:08,450
Good.

608
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,600
As a trainee of Mr. Shangguan,

609
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,010
you have good thoughts.

610
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:14,050
She’s forced me to watch it
for three times.

611
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:16,250
Now you’ve watched the video
for so many times.

612
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,170
Have you learned anything particular?

613
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,480
In this contract dispute case,

614
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,290
maybe we shouldn’t
bring all the evidence

615
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:25,930
to the court.

616
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:26,970
According to the claim of the defendant,

617
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:28,650
the acceptance list
provided by the plaintiff

618
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:29,970
could be easily challenged.

619
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:31,320
I’m afraid it wouldn’t be wise

620
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,760
to provide such evidence.

621
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,210
The counterattack

622
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,490
is in favor of the plaintiff.

623
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:37,930
Mr. Shangguan also taught me that

624
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:41,090
we should arrange the evidence
according to its strength.

625
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,050
Is that right?

626
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,610
Am I wrong?

627
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,730
Good thinking.

628
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:53,760
Yeah.

629
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,130
Keeping trying.

630
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:58,900
I’ll go ask Mr. Shangguan to look over
the cross-examination views.

631
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,530
Okay.

632
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,880
She’s more mature.

633
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,300
<i>Cross-Examination Views</i>

634
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,250
Well written.

635
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,320
But a few problems still.

636
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:13,730
Come over here.

637
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,050
This sentence.

638
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:20,010
The relevance of Exhibit 5

639
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,730
needs to be enumerated in this way.

640
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,800
These sentences.

641
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:47,250
Here.

642
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,840
Revise them and it’ll be fine.

643
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,420
Okay.

644
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,210
I get it.

645
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,480
I’m going to revise them now.

646
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,050
One more thing.

647
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:57,920
The trial is due in a few weeks.

648
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:59,010
