00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,430
It was hot in summer.

274
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,310
AC in the morgue was on full throttle,

275
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,630
so interns were always there,

276
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,480
leaving me no space to read theses.

277
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,950
Then I made up stories

278
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,060

279
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,630

280
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,230
Nothing.

281
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,220
It’s just that you’re secretive

282
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,670

283
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,510

00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,230
if you get stuck writing your thesis,

285
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,820
try doing it in the morgue.

286
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,270

00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,270

If you’re so good
at telling ghost stories,

293
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,940
just try it on her.

294
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,430
Maybe she’ll get scared

295
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,060
and throw herself into your arms.

296
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,460

297
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,940
Cong Rong isn’t one of them.

00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,460
can’t scare her.

00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,340
Even if we are,

380
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,700
it doesn’t mean anything.

381
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,980
Relationships can be on and off.

382
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,510
We don’t have to be together forever.

383
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,790
If not me,

384
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,740
who else would you rather be with?

385
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,280
Hello, Dr. Wen.

386
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,340
Dr. Wen... You said?

387
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,470
Zhong Zhen,

388
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,430
your friends are outside.

389
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,310
Go get them.

390
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,160
Zhong Zhen,

391
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,070
happy birthday!

392
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:44,480
Happy birthday!

393
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,700
Happy birthday!

394
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,310
Thank you. Thanks.

395
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,790
Hello, Dr. Wen,

396
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,470
Mrs. Wen.

397
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,340
Dr. Wen.

398
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,120
Mrs. Wen.

399
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,740
Mrs. Wen.

400
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,950
Call me Cong Rong

401
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,430
or Rong as Zhong Zhen does.

402
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:58,670
Make yourselves comfortable.

403
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,190
Grab a seat.

404
00:15:59,190 --> 00:15:59,480
Yeah.

405
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,220
Have a seat.

406
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:01,910
Zhong Zhen,

407
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,740
sit here.

408
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,980
Me?

409
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,060
Is there a problem?

410
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,940
No.

411
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,100
What would you like to eat?

412
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,220
Rong,

413
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,640
did you pick up this hazelnut cake?

414
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,940
It’s my boss’s favorite.

415
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,040
Pardon?

416
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,860
I didn’t get that.

417
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,550
I said hazelnut cake is my favorite.

418
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,390
Thanks.

419
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,150
You’re welcome.

420
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,240
Hello.

421
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,270
Would you like to order now?

422
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,700
Yes, sure.

423
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,630
Sautéed sliced pork liver.

424
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,460
My cousin said it’s good.

425
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,510
Make it ten.

426
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,510
Boss,

427
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,060
that’s too much.

428
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,630
One is enough.

429
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,820
Doesn’t she like it?

430
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,590
She can have as much as she wants.

431
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,700
Liver is good for the eyes.

432
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,460
Eat more to see things clearly.

433
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,660
Thanks.

434
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,230
I’d like ten spicy hearts and lungs.

435
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,160
For those who’re heartless,

436
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,870
those foods are just what they need.

437
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:07,740
Rong,

438
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,550
that’s way too much

439
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,540
for us to eat.

440
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,020
Take the leftovers to go.

441
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,070
So sautéed sliced pork liver

442
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,190
and spicy hearts and lungs, ten of each.

443
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,440
Anything else?

444
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:17,720
That’ll be all.

445
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,430
That’ll be all.

446
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,500
Why bother celebrating my birthday?

447
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,670
I shouldn’t have been born.

448
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,110
Excuse me.

449
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:28,980
Gotta take this.

450
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,630
Hello.

451
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:33,870
Mr. Shangguan.

452
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,280
OK.

453
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,630
I’m on my way to the court.

454
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,430
Yeah.

455
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,630
Sorry,

456
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,190
duty calls. Gotta run.

457
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,540
Wait.

458
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,780
This meal is on me.

459
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,940
Rong... Rong.

460
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,260
Boss,

461
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,240
should I get her back?

462
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,870
Forget it.

463
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,670
Let’s eat without her.

464
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,980
Yes, Boss?

465
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,150
Call Cong Rong

466
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,220
and ask her where she is.

467
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,440
What did she say?

468
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,240
Boss, she said

469
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,830
she’d be staying at a hotel
with Chengcheng.

470
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,310
A hotel?

471
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,220
Yeah.

472
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,700
She wouldn’t come back tonight?

473
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,630
I suppose.

474
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,070
Also, they’re having a girls’ night

475
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,460
and don’t wanna be disturbed.

476
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,780
I’m hanging up.

477
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,870
She doesn’t mean you.

478
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,300
She doesn’t want me to disturb her.

479
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,390
Are you a lawyer or a slave?

480
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,040
I thought you asked me

481
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,430
to hang out with you,

482
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,980
not to sit here watching you work.

483
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,480
Entertain yourself first.

484
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,430
I’m almost done.

485
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,630
Then I’ll give you a full body massage.

486
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,670
Hello.

487
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,630
It’s me, Wen Shaoqing.

488
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,150
Is Cong Rong there?

489
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,830
Wen...

490
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,540
Shower, shower.

491
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,480
She’s in the shower

492
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,000
and can’t answer the phone.

493
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,630
That’s fine.

494
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,590
I’ll hold.

495
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,940
Hello.

496
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,430
What’s up?

497
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,260
You left in a rush this morning.

498
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,220
Is there anything wrong?

499
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,260
No.

500
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,940
I left for the court to register a case.

501
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,070
Is there anything else?

502
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,110
Cong Rong.

503
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,390
Yeah?

504
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,150
Never mind.

505
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:19,670
I’m glad everything is fine.

506
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,070
Get some sleep.

507
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,700
We can talk things out

508
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,780
tomorrow night once you get back.

509
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,000
We’ll see.

510
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,740
My schedule is tight.

511
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,630
No wonder you got a hotel room for us.

512
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,940
You two had a fight?

513
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,700
What’s this?

514
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,700
Did she leave it

515
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,830
when she stayed here after you hit her?

516
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,110
What’s the use of having it now?

517
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,110
She isn’t here.

518
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,430
I don’t even get to apologize to her.

519

Almost identical to the owner.

521
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,220
That’s it?

522
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,540
What more do you want?

523
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,830
I mean,

524
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,540
could he be jealous?

525
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,300
He’s getting on my nerves on purpose.

526
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,430
Check his Moments.

527
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,350
Does he care about me at all?

528
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,590
There’s nothing other than theses

529
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,780
and drugs.

530
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,300
Febuxostat.

531
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,590
Is that also a drug?

532
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,830
Febuxostat.

533
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,070
Its homophone in Chinese means

534
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,390
“I’m not saying I don’t miss her”.

535
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,220
Clearly, he implies that he misses you.

536
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,280
I hate seeing myself like this.

537
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,390
That I get sensitive

538
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,350
when it comes to him.

539
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,740
I wasn’t like this before.

540
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,780
I know

541
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,470
he mistook me and Mr. Shangguan

542
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,910
and I could explain it to him.

543
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,260
But you see how childish he is!

544
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,500
He’s trying to piss me off.

545
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:31,070
So I’d rather say nothing.

546
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,540
Enough!

547
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:35,980
If you ask me,

548
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,260
both of you are childish.

549
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,310
But, sweetie,

550
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,740
relationships

551
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,740
aren’t lawsuits.

552
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,670
You can be spoiled,

553
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,630
cute,

554
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,700
sensitive

555
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,740
and needy.

556
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,110
All that is common.

557
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,780
Oh.

558
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,350
Love does

559
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,940
change you to someone you are not.

560
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,720
Don’t you

561
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,150
want him to comfort you?

562
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,870
Not at all!

563
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,280
I don’t think

564
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,230
Dr. Wen is being jealous for no reason.

565
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,220
Do you know

566
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,940
what it means

567
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,500
when a man gives a woman a scarf?

568
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,630
That means he’s scarfing you up

569
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,700
for the rest of his life.

570
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,460
Knock it off.

571
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,460
Back to business.

572
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,670
There’s one problem.

573
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:36,430
Shangguan Yi didn’t make it clear

574
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,110
and he’s your boss.

575
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,480
Why don’t you think up a way

576
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,220
to return the scarf?

577
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,480
When the time is right,

578
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,630
let him know
you already have a boyfriend.

579
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,190
Good idea.

580
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,520
Let me see

581
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,940
how to return it.

582
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:59,110
<i>East Gate</i>

583
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,300
Can’t you say something nice to me?

584
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:14,960
Xiong Jingjing,

585
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,220
why didn’t you make a sound?

586
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,680
You look hot-tempered.

587
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,190
Is it about your relationship?

588
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:20,460
Of course not!

589
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,020
Stop denying it.

590
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,480
We all saw

591
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,020
your post yesterday.

592
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,220
You still haven’t patched things up?

593
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,630
I can give you a few tips.

594
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,260
You?

595
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,720
Do you have a boyfriend?

596
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,190
You do and look what happened!

597
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,190
You know what?

598
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,110
If I’m in love with someone,

599
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,260
he will eventually be mine.

600
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,070
Mr. Shangguan.

601
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,700
Morning, Mr. Shangguan.

602
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,300
Mind your own business.

603
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,260
Stop worrying about me.

604
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,260
Come in.

605
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,190
Mr. Shangguan,

606
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,070
these are the files I put together

607
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,430
for Cong Rong about online loan cases.

608
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,260
Let me know if there’s anything missing.

609
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:20,070
<i>Students’ Loans</i>

610
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,150
Good.

611
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,260
They’re detailed.

612
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:28,590
Anything else?

613
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,020
Mr. Shangguan, don’t get me wrong.

614
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,630
I’m still single.

615
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,430
But Cong Rong seemed to have argued
with her boyfriend.

616
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,390
I was simply teasing her just now.

617
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,150
She has a boyfriend?

618
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:46,980
Yes.

619
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,950
You don’t know?

620
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,870
It’s that doctor at Yun Ji hospital.

621
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,470
I see.

622
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,300
You may leave.

623
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,220
Yes.

624
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,280
What...? What are you doing here?

625
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,150
Where’s Wen Shaoqing?

626
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,710
He pricked his hand during surgery,

627
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,790
so he’s kept in quarantine

628
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,480
in case of infection.

629
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,200
Quarantine?

630
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,190
Is it serious?

631
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,150
I’m not sure.

632
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,630
He asked me to take care of his dog.

633
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,830
Are you free tonight?

634
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,020
Can you feed it?

635
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,550
One of my friends back in college

636
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,500
is getting married.

637
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,440
His bachelor party is tonight

638
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,500
and he insists that I come over.

639
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,470
I might be back late.

640
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,150
No worries.

641
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,300
I’ll feed it

642
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,470
to spare you the trip.

643
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,040
OK.

644
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,780
Thanks.

645
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,460
One more thing.

646
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,020
Is it about Zhou Chengcheng?

647
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,300
She hasn’t been in the store

648
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,390
and the storage room is sealed.

649
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,390
Is she OK?

650
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,630
What’s she doing lately?

651
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,670
She’s working with a friend’s hotel

652
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,980
on outdoor parties.

653
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,350
and helping with the barbecue.

654
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,220
Do you need to see her?

655
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,390
No, no.

656
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,440
I just need to know she’s fine.

657
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,190
Bye.

658
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,790
You know Zhou Chengcheng

659
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,350
couldn’t keep anything to herself,

660
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,390
but not this time.

661
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,500
Quarantine?

662
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,540
Come in.

663
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,350
Rong.

664
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,300
Zhong Zhen,

665
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,460
how come your boss is in quarantine?

666
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,830
Is he OK?

667
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,870
He didn’t know the patient carries

668
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,500
chronic virus until the surgery is done.

669
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,630
He has been vaccinated against it.

670
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,350
But it takes time to know

671
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,980
if he’s infected.

672
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,830
I understand.

673
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,870
Didn’t you always brag about his skills?

674
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,390
How did he get pricked?

675
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,540
Rong,

676
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,480
doctors can barely
keep their hands steady

677
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,020
after working for over ten hours.

678
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:46,070
It’s common to get pricked or cut.

679
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,590
Not to mention...

680
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,740
What?

681
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,300
Not to mention he’s in a bad mood.

682
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:54,870
So...

683
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,780
You know the cause.

684
00:29:59,070 --> 00:29:59,780
I’m hanging up.

685
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:27,310
<i>Bachelor Party</i>

686
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:41,700
Chengcheng.

687
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,480
My place has just opened.

688
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,440
Everything is still a mess.

689
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,630
Thanks for helping me out.

690
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:47,720
Don’t mention it.

691
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,630
We’re friends.

692
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,150
What’s the event?

693
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,670
A bachelor party.

694
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,630
They’re gonna drink most of the time.

695
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:54,920
You don’t need to prepare too much.

696
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,590
OK.

697
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,310
I gotta go.

698
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,070
Go ahead.

699
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,430
You gotta be kidding me!

700
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,940
He’s here, too?

701
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,190
I knew it!

702
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,980
It couldn’t be a coincidence.

703
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,140
I’m sorry. My bad.

704
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,870
I... I... I didn’t mean to...

705
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:34,590
It’s me.

706
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,780
Have you been avoiding me?

707
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,830
No.

708
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,260
Why would I?

709
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,460
I’ve forgotten about that day.

710
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:54,630
Wen Rang.

711
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,960
There you are.

712
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,960
Come here.

713
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,430
Drink with us.

714
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,350
Guys,

715
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,430
look who’s here!

716
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,830
Here comes the lady killer!

717
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:06,960
Wen Rang, right?

718
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,390
It’s been a while.

719
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,430
Long time no see.

720
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,390
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

721
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:16,460
This is my last night as a bachelor.

722
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,070
After the wedding,

723
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,240
I’ll be kept on a short leash

724
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,540
without any freedom.

725
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,710
If your fiancée hears that,

726
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,020
she’ll take away your bank cards.

727
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,990
Only Wen Rang is still single

728
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,700
among us, right?

729
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,460
Back in college,

730
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,070
when you settled down
with your girlfriend,

731
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,830
we were still single.

732
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,720
He already moved in with her.

733
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,590
I know.

734
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,220
How come you guys broke up?

735
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,440
I heard

736
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,430
she’s back

737
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,540
and she’s asked about you.

738
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:44,550
Let’s drink.

739
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,150
Stop talking and start drinking.

740
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:46,830
Cheers!

741
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,350
Isn’t that Jiang Yao?

742
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:01,980
Hi.

743
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,110
It’s been a while.

744
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,470
I’ve cut my hair short.

745
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,110
I was with the bride

746
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,470
and I thought I should come over

747
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,780
and drink with you guys.

748
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,040
Congratulations!

749
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,630
Thanks.

750
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,040
Where are you going?

751
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,740
What’s wrong?

752
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:15,940
Let’s drink.

753
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,190
For old times’ sake.

754
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:18,870
Yeah.

755
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:19,630
Cheers!

756
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:20,590
Drink.

757
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,300
Jiang Yao,

758
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,220
how’s the foreign land treating you?

759
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,460
I heard you’re doing fantastic.

760
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,000
I miss the old days

761
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,630
when you guys had your own band.

762
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,830
Why don’t you...?

763
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,150
What’s on your mind?

764
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,740
Didn’t you hear our heartfelt words?

765
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,630
“Heartfelt words” means
to feel them with hearts.

766
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,630
How could I hear them?

767
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,230
They want us to perform together

768
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,630
just like we did at the college.

769
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,780
-That’s right.
-That’s right.

770
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,150
I’ll sing to your instrument.

771
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:52,830
I no longer play it.

772
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,720
I haven’t done it for ages.

773
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,350
I’m rusty.

774
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,300
You two make a perfect couple.

775
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,390
We’ve finally gotten together.

776
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,520
You can’t leave without playing a song.

777
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,390
I agree.

778
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:58,960
Do it for us.

779
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,350
Play it.

780
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,240
-Don’t be a buzzkill.
-Please.

781
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:00,680
Go ahead.

782
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,280
Go. Come with me.

783
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,040
Come on.

784
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,590
Let’s go.

785
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,190
Do it!

786
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:04,430
Guys,

787
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,040
guys,

788
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,070
a big hand, please!

789
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,150

Thanks.

798
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,190
This isn’t a good idea.

Why would she waste time on me?

You put down bait

to tempt me to rise to it.

844
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,740
You bought my book
and put your name on it

00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,410
wait.

858
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,010
Seven years ago,

859
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,820

00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,780
Wen Rang,

863
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:44,150
I love you.

864
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,260

Wen Rang!

866
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,420
I was wrong.

867
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:20,780
Jiang Yao,

868
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,030
it doesn’t matter who’s right or wrong.

869
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,340
What we had is like snow.

870
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,190
It’s melted

871
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:30,990
over the years.

872
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,300
But it matters to me.

873
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:34,860
I was wrong.

874
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,420
I admit that, OK?

875
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,220
I shouldn’t have left
without telling you.

876
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,710
I was young

877
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,630
and ignorant.

878
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,110
I couldn’t sleep night after night.

879
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,030
Then I could only say to myself,

880
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,480
“Don’t regret it.

881
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,510
You can’t regret it”.

882
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,670
But I do.

883
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,470
Jiang Yao,

884
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,220

886
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,800
You should be happy.

887
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,700
I’m not.

888
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,150
I don’t want to be successful.

889
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,190
I shouldn’t have given you up.

890
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,820
Wen Rang,

891
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,110
could you forgive me?

892
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,030
Let’s drink together.

893
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,950

894
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,470
Cheers!

895
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,070
I wish you a happy marriage
