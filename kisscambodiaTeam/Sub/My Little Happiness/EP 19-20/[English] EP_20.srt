31
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,630
I wish you a happy marriage.

32
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,100
Happily ever after.

33
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,350
Why drink like a fish with strangers?

34
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,460
You should’ve known your limit.

35
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,260
Do I know you?

36
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,300
It’s me, Wen Rang.

37
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,700
You can’t be him.

38
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,190
He...

39
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,140
He’d never be anywhere near me.

40
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,700
He’s right here.

41
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,790
I’ve...

42
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:54,790
Never ever...

43
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,580
Been in love with anyone...

44
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,910
There, there.

45
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,510
You’re breaking my heart.

46
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,510
You’re up.

47
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,660
Why did you drink so much?

48
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,860
I had to carry you upstairs.

49
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,260
What time is it?

50
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,190
3 AM.

51
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,400
Hey,

52
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,530
I made soup to sober you up.

53
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,160
Have some.

54
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,090
Hold it.

55
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:03,970
Rong,

56
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,480
I had a dream

57
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,930
that Wen Rang kissed me.

58
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,560
Your eyes are as red as rabbits’.

59
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,320
Do you really love him that much?

60
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,480
That doesn’t matter anymore.

61
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,800
Wen Rang has made it.

62
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,450
She’s back for him.

63
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,240
What a happy ending!

64
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,690
Just like you and Wen Shaoqing.

65
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,530
What about you?

66
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,410
What will you do?

67
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,040
Remember I once told you

68
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,010
he was good at singing?

69
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:47,700
Yeah.

70
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,480
I do.

71
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,240
Turns out he was singing their song.

72
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,500
I’ve never been part of their story

73
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,800
since the very beginning.

74
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:01,570
It’s OK.

75
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,650
Everything will be fine.

76
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,480

78
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,120

79
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,570
Rong,

80
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,600
I envy you guys a lot.

81
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,040
Not all people are as lucky as you

82
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,970

87
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,480
What happened to your boss?

88
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,780
His condition... Isn’t too well.

89
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,680
You’d better come over.

90
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,850
We didn’t expect
he’d develop complications.

91
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,140
He’s suffering from a lingering fever

92
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,320

I’ll make a quick call.

Zhong Zhen...

101
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,970
Where is he?

102
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,700
Dr. Qin, I...

103
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,500
He isn’t here.

104
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,210
Follow me.

105
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,240
Is it serious?

106
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,090
You should be prepared.

107
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,450
Go in.

108
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,480
Is he asleep?

109
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,570
He just drifted off.

110
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,970
How did he develop complications?

111
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,250
He had a fever a few days ago

112
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,570
which had weakened his immune system.

113
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,570
After you two fought,

114
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,450
he hardly went back to rest

115
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,040
but worked all day,

116
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,210
and took up all emergency surgeries.

117
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,380
Hey... Hey... Rong.

118
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:40,330
What are you doing?

119
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,240
Don’t cry.

120
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,410
Don’t be sad.

121
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,300
Look at me.

122
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,090
I’m fine.

123
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:49,860
All good.

124
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,420

126
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,530
what the hell is wrong with you?

127
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,410
I’m off.

00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,920

00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,240
Good for you.

131
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,240
I’m sorry.

132
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,480
I shouldn’t have lashed out at you.

133
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,890
Nothing happened
between me and Mr. Shangguan.

134
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,330
I know.

135
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,530
Do you know how worried I was?

136
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,670
Even Dr. Qin lied for you, too.

137
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,530
Please don’t be mad.

138
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,090
I’m sorry.

139
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,650

140
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,450
or messages.

141
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,040
I wasn’t sure if I could see you

142
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,700
or if you’d come.

143
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,450
So...

144
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,970
Hey,

145
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,120
I know I made a mistake,

146
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,330
but I couldn’t wait to see you.

147
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,680
Don’t do this ever again.

148
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,050
So are there complications or not?

00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:41,810

154
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,360
But what is it?

155
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,720
Lovesickness, in layman’s terms.

156
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,330
Are you messing with me again?

157
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,290
Can’t you stop?

158
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,330

<i>Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital</i>

160
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,240

and asked me to return the card to you.

162
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,210

163
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,050

New bike?

You bought another one?

168
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,090
Would money burn a hole in your pocket?

Boss got it for me

170

because he broke my old one.

171
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,940
To ride with you on New Year’s Eve
as he promised,

172
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,700
he fell hard

Say that again.

No.

186
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,730
I’ve said it already.

187
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,370
Wait for me.

188
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,040
Say it again.

189
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,880

00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,570
Why would I shower

193
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,890
in my clothes at home?

194
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,400
You’re a lawyer.

195
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,240
Should I sue you for trespassing?

196
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,000
Cover yourself first.

197
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,410
I’ll come later.

198
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,050
Hold on.

199
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,720
Pass me that jacket.

200
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,850
I said to pass me that jacket,

201
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:36,880
not to ask you to leave.

202
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:42,090
You smell nice.

203
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,360
Do you want it?

204
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,090
What?

205
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,120
I mean my body wash.

206
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,530
Better change your password

207
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,850
in case I rush in next time

208
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,090
and see things I shouldn’t.

209
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,120
That’ll be awkward.

210
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,170
Stay as it is.

211
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,360
Although we’re only two doors away,

212
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,050
they can be barriers between us

213
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,000
sometimes.

214
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,330
Rather than seeing you sleep in a rage

215
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,330
and wake up regretting for

216
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,240
the hurtful words you said,

217
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,210
I prefer

218
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,720
that you burst in

219
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:22,970
and vent your anger on me.

220
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,840
Then I can hold you and cheer you up.

221
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,880
Leave all our unhappiness

222
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,360
in the past,

223
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,720
OK?

224
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,360
Don’t I get any response

225
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,360
after all that I’ve said?

226
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:38,880
Oh.

227
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,670
That’s it?

228
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,270
I won’t let it slide

229
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,030
next time.

230
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,030
My security password is your birthday.

231
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,570
But text me before you come.

232
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,700
I’m not open to unannounced visits

233
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,640
as you are.

234
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,360
Sorry,

235
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,170
did I disturb you?

236
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,170
I... I... I guess

237
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,240
I hit the frame by accident.

238
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,000
I’m only half awake.

239
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,930
You’re up early.

240
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,450
Didn’t you sleep well last night?

241
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,370
You could’ve slept in.

242
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,330
I’m fine.

243
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,640
The hotel still needs me.

244
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:31,480
I’m healthy enough to go to work.

245
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,000
Don’t worry about me.

246
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,850
I’m taking the breakfast to go.

247
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,050
See you.

248
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,450
Call me if you need anything.

249
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,880
She must’ve

250
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,880
been sad all night.

251
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,730
When her previous relationships failed,

252
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,450
she’d cry and make a fuss

253
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,000
but soon get over them.

254
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,450
This time,

255
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,050
she’s forcing herself to look happy.

256
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,810
Apparently, she can’t get over Wen Rang.

257
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,970
If he has no feelings for her,

258
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,170
could he keep a distance from her?

259
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:09,970
OK.

260
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,640
I’ll talk to him.

261

<i>One Palace Home</i>

262
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,020
Pull yourself together

263
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,520
or Cong Rong will be worried.

264
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,940
<i>Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital</i>

265
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,720
Guys,

266
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,330
those four patients came in last night.

267
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,760
Their conditions are critical.

268
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,670
There’s a long day

269
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,980
ahead of us.

270
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,190
Are you clear about everything?

271
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,580
Treat them according to our discussion.

272
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,500
Dismissed.

273
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,980
Chen,

274
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,700
go get some rest.

275
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,820
You look pale.

276
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:08,740
Thank you, Director.

277
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,820
I’ve almost reached my limit.

278
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,100
One more shift,

279
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,640
I’d end up in ER.

280
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,700
You must’ve been cursed

281
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,670
with night shifts.

282
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,860
You’re such a jinx!

283
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,980
That look of yours

284
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,510
is never good.

285
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,910
You’re wise, Boss.

286
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,390
It’s the patient in Bed 3.

287
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,100
His children insist that he can eat food

288
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,270
and refuse to put him on TPN.

289
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:45,880
Eat food?

290
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,400
Look,

291
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,070
Zhong Zhen,

292
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,110
tell them

293
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,120
those liquid he takes

294
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,390
is hardly food.

295
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,460
There’s not enough nutrition.

296
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,500
He’s a senior

297
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,710
and he needs to build up his resistance

298
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,190
to postoperative infection.

299
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,790
I believe TPN is necessary.

300
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,740
Are your feet itchy?

301
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,270
I said so,

302
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,390
but they wouldn’t listen

303
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,590
and claimed TPN is a waste of money.

304
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,430
They kept arguing with me.

305
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,500
Zhong Zhen,

306
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,950
you’re a doctor-to-be.

307
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,870
Why didn’t you

308
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,430
explain the consequence to the patient?

309
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,110
Communication

310
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,550
is also part of our job

311
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,750
and a must-have skill.

312
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,670
Boss,

313
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,590
you should see

314
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,350
how bulging their eyes were.

315
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,670
They were scary

316
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,390
as if they’d whack me anytime.

317
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,200
You...

318
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,960
Give him a break.

319
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,500
Those people are a problem.

320
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,500
I’ll talk to them.

321
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:47,870
Follow me.

322
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,260

Mr. Shangguan,

326
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,780
here’s the preliminary evidence
regarding the online loan case.

327
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,110
This afternoon,

328
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,950
I’ll brief Miss Zhang on the progress.

329
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,540
At what time?

330
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,350
2 PM.

331
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:21,960
OK.

332
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,670
Got it.

333
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,630
What’s wrong?

334
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,150
Anything else?

335
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,630
Thank you for giving me

336
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,270
such an expensive scarf,

337
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,110
but I can’t take it.

338
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,460
I got yours dirty last time.

339
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,860
Take it as compensation from the firm.

340
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,980
In that case,

341
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,190
you can send me a red packet.

342
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,860
An Hermès scarf for spilling porridge

343
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,020
is just too much.

344
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,910
Fine.

345
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,910
You’ll get a red packet.

346
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,980

You’re a wonderful boss.

This case

353
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,950
has become a criminal one.

354
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,670
Although it’s filed by the police,

355
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,350
during the trial,

356
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,760
the judge and the defense lawyer

357
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,720

Miss Zhang.

362
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,780
Miss Zhang?

363
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,830
Are you with me?

364
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,460
Mr. Shangguan,

365
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,950
do I still have to pay them back?

366
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,700
Are you afraid that you’ll lose?

367
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,550
It’s common

368
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,950
to have pre-court jitters,

369
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,260
but trust yourself, OK?

370

You should trust him, too.

373
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,110
I’m afraid I’ll mess up the hearing.

374
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,060
There’s no time to be afraid

375
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,220
and there’s no turning back.

376
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,110
If you back down,

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,480
what about the others?

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,220
Look,

00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,350
You’ll be helping other victims.

383
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,910
Relax.

384
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,060
Be brave.

385
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,460
One more thing.

386
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,590
Shoot.

387
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,670
Will Miss Cong go to the court with us?

388
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,240
Miss Cong,

389
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,110
Mr. Shangguan,

390
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,190
if there’s nothing, I should leave.

391
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,870
Thanks for everything.

Mr. Shangguan,

394
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,020
may I join you in court?

395
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,070
Normally,

396
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:01,950
you can’t.

397
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,070
I understand.

398
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,020
I’ll work harder for it.

399
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,960
Are you eager to be in the courtroom?

400
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,780
I am.

401
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,310
This is my first case

402
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,540
since I was hired.

403
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,950
I’m not able to work independently yet

404
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,070
but I’ve seen this case

405
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,750
as my own

406
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,780
and I expect victory.

407
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,440
Are you sure we’ll win?

408
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,220
Of course.

409
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,390
That’s all about the trademark case.

410
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,700
Tang will take care of the rest.

411
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,110
OK.

412
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,020
We’ll call it a day.

413
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,220
Hold on.

414
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,430
There’s something else.

415
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,110
I recommend Cong Rong

416
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,580
to be the first chair
for the online loan case.

417
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,390
Me?

418
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,870
She’s been working on it
since the beginning

419
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,720
and she’s gained the client’s trust.

420
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,980
I believe she’s the best choice.

421
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,630
Any objections?

422
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,740
No.

423
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,190
Mr. Shangguan,

424
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,630
your apprentice is a quick learner.

425
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,910
It’s settled then.

426
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:18,980
Dismissed.

427
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:23,780
Keep up the good work.

428
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,700
Cong Rong,

429
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,870
Mr. Shangguan treats you so well.

430
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,220
Are you guys...

431
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,590
Enough. Let’s go.

432
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:33,910
Cong Rong,

433
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:34,980
you’re lucky.

434
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:36,750
Bring your A-game

435
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,150
and don’t fail Mr. Shangguan.

436
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,910
Or I’ll replace you anytime.

437
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:40,630
Just give up.

438
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,980
That’ll never happen.

439
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,190
Mr. Shangguan.

440
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,340
Mr. Shangguan,

441
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,020
are you sure I can be the first chair?

442
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,110
Didn’t you say...?

443
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,700
Yes,

444
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,950
if you’re with me.

445
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,830
Lawyers can go to court with assistants

446
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,910
after application.

447
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,110
So you can be there with me.

448
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,950
Thank you for giving me this chance.

449
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,630
I’ll give it my all.

450
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,870
Make me proud.

451
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,000
Excuse me,

452
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,830
Mr. Shangguan.

453
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,390
Hello.

454
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,020
Have you had your meal?

455
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,550
I don’t have time

456
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,950
for food.

457
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:36,960
Why?

458
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,680
I,

459
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,110
a legal assistant,

460
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,150
is going to court!

461
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,060
Really?

462
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,150
Yes!

463
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,260
Mr. Shangguan just said it
in the meeting.

464
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,200
You know how rare that is

465
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,630
for an intern?

466
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,190
They say the first year is stressful,

467
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,910
but I can be in the courtroom!

468
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,540
I’m literally over the moon!

469
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,670
Congratulations!

470
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,500
Would you like to sit in on the trial

471
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,870
to witness how I crush the others?

472
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,870
That’ll remind you not to hurt me again.

473
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,220
You’re a lawyer.

474
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,240
I wouldn’t dare to offend you.

475
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,190
I wouldn’t.

476
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,870
Let’s eat out tonight to celebrate.

477
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,270
I don’t wanna eat out.

478
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,070
So you want me to cook for you?

479
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,910
Fire away.

480
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:13,630
What would you like to eat?

481
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,980
Li Hongzhang Stew.

482
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,260
What’s the good news?

483
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,720
Share it with us.

484
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,280
Yes.

485
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:19,760
That’s right.

486
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,390
What’s going on?

487
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,350
Rong,

488
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,310
Boss,

489
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,590
sautéed pork liver you ordered last time

490
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,430
gave us nightmares.

491
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,310
Shouldn’t you

492
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,980
make it up to us?

493
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,150
Dr. Wen.

494
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,870
Today is a good day.

495
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:36,900
Why don’t we get together?

496
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,190
You two can be all lovey-dovey

497
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,620
and pretend we aren’t there.

498
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,740
It’s win-win.

499
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,020
You hear that?

500
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,870
Zhong Zhen has quite an appetite.

501
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,950
Tell him to bring lunchboxes

502
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,540
for leftovers.

503
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,020
Happy now?

504
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,700
Yes. Of course.

505
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:56,780
Absolutely.

506
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,390
She’s something!

507
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,910
Mr. Shangguan,

508
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:23,870
cut down on coffee.

509
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:24,630
It’s bad for your stomach.

510
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,500
Have some porridge instead.

511
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,430
Thank you for giving me

512
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,700
such an expensive scarf,

513
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:35,950
but I can’t take it.

514
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,220
Should I go on

515
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,930
or give up?

516
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,020
<i>Discharge Summary</i>

517
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:55,830
Boss,

518
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,060
it’s time.

519
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:57,860
I know.

520
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,630
Well,

521
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,860
I can eat later

522
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,060
but if possible,

523
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,520
they wonder...

524
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,630
I have two case reports to complete.

525
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,980
You guys go ahead.

526
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,260
I’ve booked the table.

527
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:08,390
OK.

528
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:11,760
Who’d know

529
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,220
we’d get free meals

530
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,460
whether Dr. Wen is happy and upset?

531
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,720
Zhong Zhen,

532
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,680
you’re good!

533
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,780
You guys enjoy yourselves.

534
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,500
Unlike you,

535
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,020
this is probably

536
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,620
my last meal.

537
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,960
Cheer up.

538
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,590
Let’s empty his pocket today.

539
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,780
Eat as much as we can.

540
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,630
Come on.

541
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,980
If we have no night shifts,

542
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,280
let’s play mahjong again.

543
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,200
Again?

544
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,280
You cheat every time.

545
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,670
I’ll join you if you stop cheating.

546
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,590
My dad is still in the ICU

547
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,870
and here you are having fun!

548
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:39,480
Who is he?

549
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:39,800
He’s...

550
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,520
That hot potato

551
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,110
Bed 3’s son.

552
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,870
He was sent to the ICU
this afternoon for infection.

553
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:44,830
It’s dinner time,

554
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,240
so we...

555
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,870
My dad’s life is on the line!

556
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:47,480
Step back. Calm down, sir.

557
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,830
You still have time to eat?

558
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,190
Don’t be mad.

559
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:49,680
Let’s talk.

560
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,310
You prescribed my dad

561
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,550
that expensive TPN

562
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,870
and said he’d be fine.

563
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,720
He had it this morning,
and now, he’s dying!

564
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,240
Stop!

565
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,680
Stop it!

566
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,440
Calm down!

567
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,390
Is that all you can do?

568
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:57,910
Listen.

569
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:58,750
Listen to me.

570
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,540
We can talk it out.

571
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,110
-No need to be rough.
-Yes.

572
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:00,550
Don’t pick a fight.

573
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:00,950
Yeah.

574
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:01,390
Let’s go!

575
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:01,760
Go back to the hospital!

576
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,990
So what if I beat you?

577
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:03,760
My dad is still...

578
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,110
Go!

579
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:04,800
Go to the hospital now!

580
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,760
Please control yourself.

581
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,260
I understand you’re worried

582
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,070
but we’re just interns.

583
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,040
There’s nothing much we can do.

584
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,070
Doctors are responsible for treatments.

585
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,910
Cut the crap!

586
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:13,300
Go!

587
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:13,960
Go to the hospital!

588
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,390
Go!

589
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,070
Go to the hospital!

590
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,020
I’m not responsible for it.

591
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:16,760
Look...

592
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,630
Come with us!

593
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,310
Stop it!

594
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:18,680
Go!

595
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,000
Let’s go!

596
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,460
What are you doing?

597
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,440
Let’s go!

598
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,540
Go to the Medical Association!

599
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,740
Go there now!

600
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,540
Let’s go!

601
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,550
Let’s go!

602
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,390
What are you doing?

603
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,060
Who are you?

604
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,590
Please

605
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,280
calm down.

606
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,070
Control yourselves.

607
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:32,980
Who the hell are you?

608
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,500
I’m their teacher.

609
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,960
You can talk to me.

610
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,870
You’re a doctor?

611
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,590
You people

612
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,020
look gentle,

613
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,540
but you broke my hand.

614
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,670
I demand compensation and an apology

615
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,540
or I’ll report you to
the Medical Association!

616
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:46,870
Yes.

617
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:47,520
We’ll report you!

618
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,110
Boss,

619
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,500
they’re Bed 3’s family.

620
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,020
It’s my fault.

621
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,780
I did shove them.

622
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:58,870
I’ll apologize.

623
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,460
Look,

624
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,790
the doctor talked to you before surgery

625
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,060
and informed you of all the risks.

626
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,060
You signed the paper yourself.

627
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,870
If you suspect malpractice,

628
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,110
just check with
the Medical Association.

629
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,830
Don’t pick a fight with those kids

630
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,030
before the result comes out.

631
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,960
You doctors

632
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,820
have all sorts of excuses.

633
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,960
Don’t waste breath on them.

634
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,590
Yeah!

635
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,680
I’ll sue you!

636
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,590
I’ll go to the Medical Association!

637
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,190
Please

638
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:25,960
stop making a scene.

639
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,440
Calm down!

640
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:26,870
Stop it!

641
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:27,440
Break it off!

642
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,060
I’ll sue you!

643
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:28,750
Stop!

644
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,700
I’ll sue you!

645
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,350
I’ll sue your ass off!

646
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,460
What are you doing?

647
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,950
I’m sorry, Dr. Wen.

648
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,740
Without us,

649
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,720
you wouldn’t have injured your hand.

650
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,590
Don’t worry.

651
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,590
Nothing serious.

652
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,460
Rong.

653
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,630
What happened?

654
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,020
Does it hurt?

655
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,630
I’m fine,

656
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,430
but Boss... His hand...

657
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,390
Are you in pain?

658
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,540
Are you his family?

659
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:20,950
Officer,

660
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,390
<i>Legal Assistant Cong Rong</i>
I’m a lawyer.

661
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,630
Lawyer?

662
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,390
I’m hiring you

663
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,390
to sue them,

664
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,280
their hospital

665
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:27,910
and him!

666
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:28,680
He hit me!

667
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,540
Stop yelling!

668
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,020
Being loud doesn’t make you right.

669
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,110
Try that in court. I dare you!

670
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,950
They look worse than you.

671
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,590
Didn’t you hit them?

672
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,550
It’s their fault!

673
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,460
And

674
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,060
I won’t represent you.

675
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,910
Feel free to file a complaint
to the Bar Association.

676
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,390
My name is Cong Rong.

677
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,500
What’s that attitude?

678
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,150
What are you doing?

679
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,110
Look around.

680
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,220
This is a police station.

681
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,150
Miss Cong,

682
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,260
come.

683
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,350
This is

684
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,000
an affray case at most.

685
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,220
Fill out the paperwork

686
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,460
and pay the fine,

687
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,430
then

688
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,220
they can leave.

689
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,390
OK.

690
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,380
Zhong Zhen,

691
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,510
your cousin is awesome!

692
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,000
You bet.

693
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,540
They’re ridiculous.

694
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,950
Even if they do make a complaint,

695
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,240
the Bar Association

696
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,540
won’t do anything to my cousin soon.

697
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,540
It’s late.

698
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,190
Go back and get something to eat.

699
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,060
We can talk at work tomorrow.

700
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,150
Let’s go eat at my place.

701
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,190
The paperwork is done.

702
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:24,590
You should join us.

703
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,860
How’s your hand?

704
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,670
Let me see.

705
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,780
Does it still hurt?

706
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,590
It looks bad.

707
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:33,910
Ow!

708
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,040
Your hospital is nearby.

709
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,060
Let’s go get you checked again

710
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,100
for fractures.

711
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,260
Move your hand for me.

712
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,630
Why is it still bleeding?

713
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,870
Let’s go home.

714
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:03,980
Here you are.

715
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,520
Clean your wounds

716
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,060
before your family see them.

717
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,020
Be gentle!

718
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:13,680
Nice and easy!

719
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,390
Hand me a swab.

720
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,150
Swab?

721
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,110
Give me one.

722
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,870
Thank you, Miss Cong.

723
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,500
Just now, Dr. Wen was so cool.

724
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,100
He protected us

725
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,230
against those three.

726
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,390
He’s my hero!

727
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,590
Super cool!

728
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,200
Yes!

729
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:26,780
Yeah!

730
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,820
Dr. Wen seems less sporty

731
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,550
but he has abs.

732
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:30,960
Really?

733
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,240
Yeah!

734
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,480
You found time to peek during the fight?

735
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,510
Yeah!

736
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,630
Hey,

737
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,480
isn’t he always calm?

738
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,260
How come he lost it today?

739
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,830
Actually, he’s under a lot of stress.

740
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,740
As gentle and kind as he is,

741
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,910
he can get edgy sometimes

742
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,780
even though he hides it well.

743
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,540
Is it because
he faces life and death every day?

744
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,500
Not just that.

745
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,950
Other than surgery,
he has to do research,

746
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,060
treat patients

747
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,150
and work on his thesis.

748
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,700
On top of that,

749
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,910
he needs to
explain everything to patients.

750
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,430
Being a doctor

751
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:04,980
is hard.

752
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,060
That’s hard?

753
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,900
Other than doctors,

754
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,980
try being patients

755
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,990
and their family.

756
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,070
I wish

757
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,670
I could just be a doctor.

758
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,740
Hey,

759
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:17,710
food is ready.

760
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,520
Let’s eat.

761
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,000
Let’s go.

762
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,980
Time to eat.

763
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:22,960
This is a lot!

764
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,740
What a feast!

765
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,910
Why didn’t you talk to me

766
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,220
when you were stressed out?

767
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,590
I feel much better with you around.

768
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,980
You cooked for us with an injured hand.

769
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,220
Did you get it wet?

770
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:42,900
I’m fine.

771
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,830
Let’s eat.

772
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,590
Eat up.

773
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,070
What do you think?

774
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:48,590
Do you like it?

775
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,350
Tastes good, yeah?

776
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,280
There’s one more dish.

777
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:54,870
I’ll go get it.

778
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:55,430
Boss,

779
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,110
have a seat.

780
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,040
I’ll go.

781
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,830
Let me do it.

782
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,390
Quite a fancy dinner!

783
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,000
Wow!

784
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,760
What is this?

785
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,950
It looks amazing!

786
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,870
You made Li Hongzhang Stew!

787
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,270
It’s long overdue.

788
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,220
I didn’t get to cook it for you

789
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,540
until today.

790
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:18,870
Try it

791
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,980
and see if it’s as good as your mom’s.

792
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,460
Taste it

793
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,700
or they’ll clean all the plates.

794
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,540
Cousin,

795
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,510
he made this for you despite his injury.

796
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,230
Look

797
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,020
how well he treats you.

798
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:37,910
Shut up and eat.

799
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,540
It’s tasty.

800
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,540
Boss,

801
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,060
you were like a superhero earlier.

802
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,070
I agree.

803
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,720
Super hot!

804
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,760
Starting from today,

805
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,460
I’ll work out regularly.

806
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,280
Not just that.

807
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,200
I’ll work on my speech.

808
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,020
If I can’t beat them up,

809
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,020
I can still win by persuasion.

810
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:12,350
Give it a rest.

811
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,020
Not bad, actually.

812
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:13,870
Right?

813
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:15,460
Persuasion can be useful,

814
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,270
but don’t engage in

815
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:19,390
unnecessary fight.

816
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,660
Or what would our workplace be?

817
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,910
A boxing ring or a debate club?

818
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,460
Understand?

819
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,430
Yes.

820
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,030
For some reason,

821
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,910
fewer and fewer people
choose to be doctors.

822
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,020
I also know

823
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,870
you might be one of them

824
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:35,460
after graduation.

825
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,140
But a world without doctors is sad.

826
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,620
No one wants to see that happen.

827
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:42,980
The right amount of resistance

828
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,750
is to give hope to the hopeless.

829
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,580
Intensifying contradictions
won’t solve the problem.

830
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:49,620
On the contrary,

831
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:51,820
the moment people start to fight,

832
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,270
they’re already on the wrong path.

833
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:56,350
Forget about what happened today.

834
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:58,750
Tomorrow, when you put on your uniform,

835
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,390
you must still adhere to the oath

836
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,660
that you’ll abide by medical ethics,

837
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,870
respect your teachers,
observe disciplines

838
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,710
and save lives at all costs.

839
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:07,830
Yes.

840
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:08,540
Boss,

841
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:09,560
rest assured.

842
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,830
We’ll study hard

843
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:11,640
and become good doctors.

844
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,750
-That’s right.
-Yeah.

845
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,900
Really?

846
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,910
Then why haven’t I

847
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,390
received your thesis?

848
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,600
I’m probably sick

849
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,790
that my laziness is worsening.

850
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:22,830
Laziness?

851
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,790
That’s still incurable, isn’t it?

852
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:26,720
Better dig your own grave

853
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,750
and bury yourself in it.

854
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:28,600
Go ahead.

855
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,270
Do it.

856
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:29,980
Zhong Zhen.

857
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,500
Xia,

858
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,870
let me peel an orange for you.

859
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:36,540
Sure.

860
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,580
I’m surprised that you think of me.

861
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,710
I’m thinking of you all the time.

862
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,800
It’s late.

863
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,720
Dr. Wen, Miss Cong,

864
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,800
we should leave.

865
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,640
Good night. Bye.

866
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,310
-Bye.
-See you.

867
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,020
Are you mad at me?

868
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,180
For what?

869
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,870
Zhong Zhen’s injury.

870
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,710
Not at all.

871
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,750
A man’s life without injures

872
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,350
is incomplete.

873
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,620
He grew up with me.

874
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,800
Sometimes, I wish I’d be a boy

875
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,660
so that I wouldn’t influence him
in a negative way.

876
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,070
Are you afraid...

877
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:21,620
I’m afraid he’d be... A sissy.

878
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,230
You’re worrying too much.

879
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:29,180
Why did you agree to teach Zhong Zhen?

880
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,580
I don’t think he fits
into your category.

881
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,430
What is my category?

882
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:36,460
The brainy, I guess?

883
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,710
I value characters and manners

884
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,460
more than talent and knowledge.

885
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,230
Doctors are normal and special.

886
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,910
I want my students to study medicine

887
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,060
because they love it,

888
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,580
not because of something else.

889
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,910
And Zhong Zhen ticks all the boxes.

890
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,270
He wants to be a doctor

891
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,580
because of your grandma, right?

892
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,060
How did you know?

893
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,230
When you made
Li Hongzhang stew a while back,

894
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,910
I got curious

895
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,910
and asked Zhong Zhen about it.

896
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:15,910
He said

897
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,750
when your grandma died of illness,

898
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,750
you were abroad and unable to see her.

899
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,760
Only she could make that dish,

900
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,620
so to you, that’s something
to remember her by.

901
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:32,540
Zhong Zhen is such a blabbermouth!

902
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,100
He chose this career out of passion,

903
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,830
not because of my grandma.

904
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:39,800
What about you?

905
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,830
Why do you wanna be a doctor?

906
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,460
You know why I’m named “Shaoqing”?

907
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,590
The ancients said

908
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,580
to either be a good official

909
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,750
or a good physician.

910
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,230
My parents were always abroad
doing research,

911
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,750
so my grandpa practically raised me.

912
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,020
He practiced
traditional Chinese medicine,

913
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,950
but made me read
all kinds of medical books.

914
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,100
I know how hard it is to be a doctor.

915
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,870
If people could choose,

916
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:13,870
I bet nobody would be it.

917
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:19,100
But someone has to do it.

918
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,020
My grandpa said
to always do the right thing

919
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,270
no matter how hard it is.

920
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,830
“Physician” is another word
for “doctor”.

921
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,910
It’s given to officials
in ancient times

922
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,830
who served the state and the public,

923
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,390
just like my name suggests.

924
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,390
That’s probably my fate.

925
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,980
“Do the right thing

926
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,230
no matter how hard it is”.

927
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:46,070
My dad used to say

928
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,230
something similar to me.

929
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:50,500
I bet he doesn’t know the next line.

930
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,350
What is it?

931
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,710
“I’ll always love you and miss you

932
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,020
no matter how far we are”.
