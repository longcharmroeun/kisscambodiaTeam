00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,010
You said you were Cong Rong
from Class 11.

192
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,650
But before I could tell you that

193
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,680
I was Wen Shaoqing in Class 9,

194
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,010
you transferred to another school.

195
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,770
White.

196
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,680
The college girls

197
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,010
all like this color, right?

198
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:03,490
Girls’ white skirts, boys’ white shirts.

199
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,890
When I was in college,
I studied running script.

200
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,130
If we met in college,

201
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,340
<i>Cong, the book says gentle and calm,
years of quietness.</i>

202
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,440

There’s love in school.

205
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,800
In college, I read a few books,

206
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,080
so even my confession is full of books.

207
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,440

208
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,840
Mature and stable.

209
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,610
As a doctor, I wrote too many cases,

210
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,490
<i>Frown, smile, glance, a couple always.</i>
so I used the doctors’ usual font, cursive script.

211
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,140
<i>Frown, smile, glance, a couple always.</i>

212
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,680
At this age,

213
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,200
if I write love letters,

214
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,410
I won’t

215
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,530
write about love.

216
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,080

00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,210
Zhou Chengcheng made many dishes.

379
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,560
She’s so sweet.

380
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,540
I haven’t had a good meal
for a long time.

381
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,120
I’m sick of crunchy crackers.

382
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,320
Why aren’t you eating?

383
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,450
I can be full watching you eat.

384
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,290
Cong Rong.

385
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,820
Come to my house for the New Year.

386
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,340
My parents are coming back this year.

387
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,770
You can meet my parents.

388
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,010
What did you say?

389
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,400
I’m serious.

390
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,050
All of a sudden?

391
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,780
But can I?

392
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,450
Of course, you’re the girl I like.

393
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:20,060
I mean, am I their type?

394
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,560
How is my hair?

395
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,380
How are my clothes?

396
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,100
Should I change my look?

397
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,210
No, they like everything about you.

398
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,620
I’ll take that as a yes.

399
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,490
I want to say...

400
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,490
No?

401
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,730
No, my shirt got grease on it.

402
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,090
It won’t come out.

403
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,880
Leave it to me.

404
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,400
You just leave yourself to me.

405
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:51,880
Mom, I have some bad news.

406
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,770
No, you’re scaring me.

407
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,340
Is everything okay?

408
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,480
I’m fine.

409
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,400
I can’t go home for New Year this year.

410
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,850
Will you spend the New Year at Shaoqing’s?

411
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:07,970
That’s great.

412
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,800
That’s good news, not bad news.

413
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,880
You won’t see your lovely daughter.

414
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,970
That’s okay.

415
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,900
After you get married,

416
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,290
you go home together for the New Year.

417
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,240
I’ll be so happy.

418
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,400
So, what’s the plan?

419
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,360
Not yet.

420
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,120
Why?

421
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,120
Then why are you blushing?

422
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,250
Come on, tell me.

423
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,250
How’s it going? How far have you gone?

424
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,050
Has he asked you to marry him?

425
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,120
So, when can I have a grandchild?

426
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:42,800
Oh.

427
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,800
You have so much free time.
Take good care of Dad Jiang,

428
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,290
and cook delicious meals for him.

429

Happy New Year!

433
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:11,970
Let’s go.

435
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:36,450
This...

436
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,320
Is this the Phalaenopsis
that Grandma likes?

437
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,010
Yeah.

00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:02,730
Are you nervous?

440
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:04,530
I’m fine.

441
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:05,930
Deep breathing is

442
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,170
a subconscious activation of

443
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:11,930
the parasympathetic nervous system
to release pressure.

444
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,560
What should I do? I’m so nervous that
I can’t walk well.

445
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,400
It’s okay. Just do as usual.

446
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,840
We’ll just have dinner.

447
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,880
My family is very easygoing.

448
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,080
We’re almost there.

449
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,850
Here, hold your bonus items.

450
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:27,600
Okay.

451
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,860
Grandma.

452
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,850
Grandma.

453
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,400
Take your time. Slow down.

454
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,730
Hello, Grandma, I’m Cong Rong.

455
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,060
Grandma.

456
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,300
This is the girl

457
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,210
I was telling you about.

458
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:44,400
Good. You are pretty.

459
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,330
Better than the picture.

460
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,360
You look good, too.

461
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,800
I’m what you call

462
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,690
a fashion old lady.

463
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,690
Oh, I almost forgot.

464
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,050
This is a gift for you.

465
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,680
Yeah. Grandma.

466
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,200
She knows you like Phalaenopsis.

467
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,290
So she found it specially.

468
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,810
That’s very kind of you.

469
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,450
The color is rare.

470
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,930
His grandpa asked me to look for it
for a long time,

471
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,060
but I couldn’t find it.

472
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,100
Thank you so much.

473
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,080
You’re welcome.

474
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,770
So nice.

475
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,320
She’s usually better,
but she’s a little nervous today.

476
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:20,320
That’s good.
It means she cares about you.

477
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,770
Come on. Come on in.

478
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:23,400
Let’s go.

479
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,490
I’ll prepare some dumpling stuffing.

480
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,530
You take her to meet Grandpa.

481
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,290
Where’s he?

482
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,080
He’s doing municipal construction.

483
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,320
Municipal construction?

484
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,880
It’s a good spot. I’ll take it.

485
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,400
Let me get the floor for you.

486
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,400
Okay, your turn.

487
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,250
3,500 points.

488
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,530
Here you are.

489
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,840
Not enough.

490
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:52,800
Five.

491
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,010
I told you.

492
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,120
I’ll stay in the jail today.

493
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,490
What’s the fun in that?

494
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:02,490
It teaches you to buy houses and land

495
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,380
when you have money.

496
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,050
-That’s interesting.
-That’s interesting.

497
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,450
Grandpa, just ignore him.

498
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,610
He’s envious of your young mentality.

499
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:12,680
Rong, you’re here.

500
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,340
Uncle, this is Cong Rong.

501
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,060
I told you.

502
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,560
This is my best friend.

503
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,050
Uncle…

504
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,480
Grandpa. Happy New Year!

505
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,600
Happy New Year! Happy New Year!

506
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,080
Sit down.

507
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,400
Wen Rang, make some tea.

508
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,120
Go.

509
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,250
Okay, I’ll go.

510
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,400
Sit down.

511
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,120
Grandpa, let me introduce her for you.

512
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,010
Cong Rong.

513
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,770
Your girlfriend, a lawyer.

514
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:40,490
She fought a lawsuit for you and
just got back from the rescue with you.

515
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,490
You were after her, right?

516
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,360
Grandpa, you’re the Oracle.

517
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:52,610
Chengcheng muttered from time to time,

518
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,160
so I remembered that.

519
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,360
You’re always bragging about me.

520
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,680
Uncle, we’ve got a live one.

521
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,210
What do you think of her?

522
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,770
Good.

523
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,320
She’s just too skinny.

524
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,290
Come on, show me.

525
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,360
Smell it. Is it okay?

526
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:16,800
What did you say?

527
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:18,800
That’s not enough for you?

528
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,620
You can’t drink strong tea.

529
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,690
Smell it. Is it okay?

530
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:22,730
Okay.

531
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,010
All right. You said it’s okay.

532
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:36,010
Learn from her. Eat and drink well.

533
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:38,530
I don’t eat that much.

534
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:39,650
Don’t you?

535
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,490
You’re the No.1 omnivore.

536
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,130
Drink tea.

537
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:43,900
Drink tea.

538
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,560
Rangyirang made the tea.

539
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,250
Rangyirang can make the tea?

540
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,400
Yeah, it can bite you.

541
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,250
Get away from my seat.

542
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:52,120
Be good. Pour the tea, Rangyirang.

543
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,930
We never interfere

544
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,290
with these kids.

545
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,000
But Shaoqing

546
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,320
never brought girls home.

547
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,210
It’s different this time.

548
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,480
He brings you to our home.

549
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,290
And he must be serious.

550
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,050
We talked it over with his parents and

551
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:19,530
we got you a welcome gift.

552
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:21,780
Grandpa, it’s too much.

553
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,810
I can’t take it.

554
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:23,970
Take it.

555
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,530
It’s a gift from the elders. Take it.

556
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,640
Take it.

557
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,310
Open it.

558
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,800
This looks like blue amber,

559
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,290
a kind of amber.

560
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:43,250
I don’t know what the print is.

561
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,360
Pi Xiu?

562
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,400
Bi An.

563
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,320
It’s the seventh son of the Dragon.

564
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,880
It’s on the gate of Yamen.

565
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:57,100
It’s said to judge cases impartially.

566
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,640
Good point.

567
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,210
Then it’s for you.

568
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,290
Thanks, Grandpa. I’ll collect it well.

569
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,640
Great.

570
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,120
Dragon has nine sons.

571
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,640
Does he love the youngest the most?

572
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,490
You like it?

573
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,490
I’ll give one to you.
It’s perfect for you.

574
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,640
Okay.

575
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,640
Let’s make dumplings.

576
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,140
Dumplings. Go.

577
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:23,970
Help Grandma make dumplings.

578
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:24,540
Okay.

579
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,320
Coming, Mom.

580
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,780
Let’s go help, too.

581
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,490
Go.

582
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:28,730
Grandpa, we’re going.

583
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:29,690
Go, go.

584
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,970
Darling. Slow down.

585
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,690
It’s good to be at home.

586
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,400
Professor Wen, Professor Lin.

587
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,840
May I help you with your luggage?

588
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,490
No, we’ll do it ourselves.

589
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,290
The Dean arranged everything well.

590
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,300
Thank him for us.

591
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:15,650
Yes.

592
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:16,250
Okay.

593
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,690
It’s our appreciation. Take it.

594
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:20,450
You don’t have to do this. It’s my job.

595
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:21,770
Take it.

596
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,880
It’s New Year today.

597
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,540
You’ve worked so hard to pick us up.

598
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,380
Just take it.

599
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,410
Take it.

600
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:30,120
I wish you a happy new year
and a happy family.

601
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,300
Thank you, thank you.

602
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:31,730
Thank you.

603
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:32,600
Bye.

604
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:34,860
Mom, Dad.

605
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,690
Let’s go.

606
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,770
Son.

607
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,050
Son.

608
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,400
You must be tired after
flying for over ten hours.

609
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,250
I’m not tired when I see you.

610
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,800
This is Cong Rong, right?

611
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,010
Hello, Uncle and Aunt, I’m Cong Rong.

612
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,490
Come into the room. It’s cold outside.

613
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:51,400
I’ll get the luggage.

614
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,730
No, no, no. Go.

615
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,380
I’ll take it.

616
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,450
Come on, son.

617
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:55,860
Grandma and Grandpa are waiting for you.
The food is ready.

618
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,880
All right. Come on.

619
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,120
It must be hard on you, Aunt.

620
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:58,690
Are you okay?

621
00:33:58,690 --> 00:33:59,250
I’m okay.

622
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:02,210
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

623
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:05,650
-Good health to Mom and Dad.
-Happy New Year.

624
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:08,650
-Good health to Grandma and Grandpa.
-Good health to Grandma and Grandpa.

625
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,780
Thank you. Good luck to the kids.

626
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,450
Happy New Year, Aunt and Uncle.

627
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:12,410
All right, drink.

628
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:13,600
Drink.

629
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:22,130
Eat. Don’t wait for us.

630
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,050
-Come on.
-Eat.

631
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,760
You have a good appetite, so eat more.

632
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:26,160
Wen Rang. Shaoqing.

633
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:27,640
Take care of your girlfriends.

634
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,970
Did you hear that?

635
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:30,090
Aunt asked you to take care of me.

636
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,120
Yeah. I heard it.

637
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,220
It’s not the time yet.

638
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,010
I’ll get you some pepto-bismol
after dinner.

639
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,080
I can do it myself.

640
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,260
It’s the mission Grandma gave us.

641
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,280
Thank you.

642
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:40,130
How long can you stay here?

643
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,370
We’re not

644
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,960
going anywhere.

645
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,660
That’s right.

646
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,650
Really?

647
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:45,520
Yeah.

648
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,300
After all, that’s not our home abroad.

649
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,250
There is a sense of wandering.

650
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,920
So it’s better to go home.

651
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,410
That’s nice.

652
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,850
Chinese medical technology is good,

653
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,860
and investment funds are sufficient.

654
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,040
So we discussed it carefully and

655
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,130
transferred the personnel relationship

656
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,330
back to Yun Ji Hospital.

657
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,380
Dad, you’re back in Neurosurgery?

658
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,290
Yeah.

659
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:06,700
Yeah.

660
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,680
Your mom’s back in Thoracic Surgery.

661
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,850
Next year,

662
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:09,920
we

663
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,370
can meet at the hospital.

664
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,560
Don’t you welcome us?

665
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:13,640
Come on.

666
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,450
Congratulations.

667
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,220
Congratulations.

668
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,080
Dr. Wen, you’ve made it this far.

669
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,850
You’re not young,

670
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,810
so you’d better go home.

671
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,530
Nothing is important

672
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,640
but family.

673
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:34,970
Family’s good.

674
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,260
-Poverty doesn’t matter.
-Poverty doesn’t matter.

675
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,410
That’s true.

676
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,450
Yeah, I agree with old...

677
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,220
No old.

678
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,810
Dad’s words.

679
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:50,330
Congratulations.
Brother and sister-in-law.

680
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,340
From now on, your father watches you.

681
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,560
And mine watches me.

682
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,560
That’s a lot of balance right there.

683
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,410
Welcome home.

684
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,370
Thank you.

685
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,220
Eat the dishes.

686
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,330
Dumplings.

687
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,610
Eat.

688
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:08,090
Just eat your food.

689
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:08,530
Food’s getting cold.

690
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:09,720
Who made the dumpling? Eat it.

691
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,820
This one, this pig-like one is mine.

692
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,680
I know it.

693
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,180
Oh, it’s leaking.

694
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:14,760
It’s leaking.

695
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,680
It’s leaking.

696
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,490
The pig’s alive.

697
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,220
Try my mom’s egg dumplings.

698
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:22,700
Dad, eat.

699
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,930
Okay. Let me eat.

700
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:24,450
Cong Rong.

701
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,010
Thank you, Aunt.

702
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:25,610
Eat more.

703
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:26,450
You eat more.

704
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,330
Okay, Dad.

705
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,930
This is good.

706
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,380
Come on.

707
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,260
Stop talking and eat.

708
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:31,930
Eat this.

709
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,050
This is good.

710
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,000
This is you, not obedient at all.

711
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,220
What?!

712
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,370
How obedient I am.

713
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,810
That bets I made with you.

714
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,400
Open my own bookstore

715
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,810
and get a girlfriend.

716
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:43,120
I’ve done them all.

717
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:47,680
Go and play.

718
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,130
Go, go.

719
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:49,890
Go play.

720
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,600
Look at that. Three stars.

721
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,610
On the left is the Longevity Star,

722
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:06,130
the middle is the Prosperity star,
and the right is the Luck Star.

723
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:07,010
Good, huh?

724
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,850
Yeah.

725
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:11,660
Aunt, I thought it was Wen Shaoqing.

726
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,850
Put this on.

727
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:15,010
You put it on. I wear more.

728
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,680
How is it? Are you used to it?

729
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:22,160
Good. It’s a good family.

730
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,640
Is this your first time outside
on New Year?

731
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,720
Yes.

732
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,050
But I do video chat with them.

733
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,330
I don’t want them to think
they’re empty nesters.

734
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,440
Shaoqing told me

735
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,600
the story of you two

736
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,610
about a banyan tree.

737
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,120
He told you that?

738
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,760
He loved school so much

739
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:46,530
because he was waiting for you.

740
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:49,410
He really likes you.

741
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,010
You like him a lot, too?

742
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,330
I like him as a boyfriend,

743
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,530
and

744
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,160
as a doctor.

745
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,560
His integrity, detachment,

746
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,850
discipline and empathy

747
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,810
are all good.

748
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,480
Aunt, look.

749
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,760
That’s a lot of fireworks.

750
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:13,260
Look, come here.

751
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,260
Look, it’s beautiful.

752
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,010
