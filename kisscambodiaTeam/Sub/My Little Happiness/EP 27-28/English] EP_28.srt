<i>Episode 28</i>

00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,740
<i>Happy Spring Festival</i>

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,260
<i>Happy New Year</i>

33
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,670
Luckily, I didn’t get up too late.

34
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,180
Can the oil on the shirt be washed off?

35
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,020
Just leave the shirt to me.

36
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,020
And you.

37
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,180
Just trust me and leave yourself to me.

38
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,620
You’re up.

39
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,580
I thought to wake you up.

40
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,020
I tend to wake up early in a new place.

41
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,180
You look good in it.

42
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,860
Your skill is good, too.

43
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,680
But the shirt is too small for you

44
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,620
to embroider.

45
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,740
I’ll tell Grandpa you’d like to embroider

46
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,590
Along the River During
the Qingming Festival for him.

47
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,830
Don’t you dare.

48
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,860
I’m kidding.

49
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,380
What’s the name of the flower?

50
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,310
Forget the flower’s name.

51
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,110
Go to pay New Year’s call

52
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,590
to Grandparents in this.

53
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,260
I’m sure they’ll be very happy.

54
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,980
What’s the name on earth?

55
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,100
Chinese cinnamon.

56
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,190
Chinese cinnamon?

57
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,420
Isn’t it seasoning?

58
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,470
You can say so.

59
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,310
Cinnamon twig is
a traditional Chinese medicine.

60
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,160
Cassia twig. Cassia twig is good.

61
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,600
In the Treatise on Cold Damage Diseases
compiled by Zhang Zhongjing,

62
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,660
the cinnamon twig soup
is the first prescription,

63
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,310
known as the Top Prescription.

64
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,420
Got it?

65
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,660
Cinnamon? The Top Prescription?

66
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,380
It’s interesting.

67
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,510
Hold on.

68
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,230
You are misleading me.

69
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,030
I don’t mean it’s bad.

70
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,540
But, why will Grandparents be happy

71
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,230
seeing me wear it?

72
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,750
Cinnamon blooms and then bears fruits.

73
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,030
The fruits are called “cassia seeds”.

74
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,070
It’s auspicious.

75
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,580
Are “cassia seeds” auspicious?

76
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,170
Cassia seeds mean “have babies soon”.

77
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,340
I’m gonna get it changed.

78
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,190
Isn’t it good? Why changing it?

79
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,430
What do you think?

80
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,510
Wen Rang! Stop there!

81
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,790
Let’s talk!

82
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,390
I’m not a flower.

83
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,030
Why watering me?

84
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,670
You knew the ninth son of dragon
is called Chiwen,

85
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,480
and you gave me that.
I’ve checked online.

86
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,750
What’s wrong with Chiwen?

87
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,430
Chiwen means a fool!

88
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,110
Alright. Alright. Alright.

89
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,100
I’m not making fun of you.

90
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,070
Go get changed.

91
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,220
We’ll pay New Year’s call
for red packets.

92
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,110
Red packets?

93
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,990
Yes.

94
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,460
Big red packets.

95
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,190
But in my family,

96
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,110
you’ll have to say auspicious words.

97
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,990
Can you do it?

98
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,070
Father. Mother. Happy New Year.

99
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,700
May you have longevity.

100
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,470
A couplet for you.

101
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,550
“By reading thousands of scrolls,

102
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,630
spring comes beyond the walls”.

103
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,190
-Good.
-Good.

104
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,390
Wish you good luck

105
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,750
and great success.

106
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,380
<i>Bliss</i>

107
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,780
Thanks.

108
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,310
Grandpa. Grandma.

109
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,990
Cong Rong and I have a couplet for you.

110
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,340
“Mediate in mountain
with peace in mind.”

111
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,310
“Enjoy leisure free from worries.”

112
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,960
Good. Good.

113
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,990
You are a good match.

114
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,700
We like it.

115
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,230
Here. Red packets.

116
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,430
-Thank you, Grandpa, Grandma.
-Thank you, Grandpa, Grandma.

117
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,510
You’re good.

118
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,260
Big red packets, aren’t they?

119
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,310
Your turn.

120
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,140
It’s easy-peasy to say auspicious words.

121
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,150
Dad and Mom.

122
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,160
“Eat and drink as you please.

123
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,830
Never mind any annoyances.”

124
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,750
It...

125
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,790
“Raise flowers and have pet birds.

126
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,380
Live happily for every second”.

127
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,150
A perfect match.

128
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,840
You buffoons.

129
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,310
Dad, Mom. Red packets!

130
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,670
Wish you good fortune.

131
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,870
Red packets, please!

132
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,550
Here! Red packets!

133
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,870
You two buffoons.

134
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,310
<i>Bliss</i>

135
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,510
It’s really a big red packet.

136
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,720
I haven’t been so happy

137
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,220
on Spring Festival for long.

138
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,480
Any other events in your family?

139
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,140
Take mine.

140
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,950
That’s a hard job.

141
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,580
You are indeed in a medical family.

142
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,430
We change medicine cards every year.

143
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,520
<i>Cortex Ailanthi</i>

144
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,110
Five hundred cards with regular script.

145
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,630
Be seated all the afternoon.

146
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,390
Will you get bored?

147
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,350
No.

148
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,720
These names are interesting.

149
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,670
I’ve never heard of them.

150
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,580
“Sandy Moon.” An elegant name.

151
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,550
For eye diseases and detoxification.

152
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,510
Is it herbal medicine?

153
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:55,990
No.

154
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,220
What is it?

155
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,780
Hare dung.

156
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,480
“Luminous Night Sand” <i>bat’s droppings</i>

157
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,870
couldn’t be something good.

158
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,020
No. No.

159
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,030
“White Lilac” is good.

160
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,140
Is it lilac?

161
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,310
Take it out and smell it.

162
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,220
How is it?

163
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,550
Smells bad.

164
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,020
Sparrow droppings.

165
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,190
All the medicines here

166
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,820
are droppings?

167
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,460
Not really.

168
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,140
The first row at the top.

169
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,380
The first cell.

170
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,630
Rou Cong Rong <i>Desertliving Cistanche</i>.

171
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,190
The same name as mine. Not droppings.

172
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,270
I’m glad for it.

173
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,660
What does it cure?

174
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,950
Invigorate organs.

175
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,870
Replenish Qi. Good to have babies.

176
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,550
Go back to babies again.

177
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,630
Would you like to write?

178
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,510
I don’t write well.

179
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,550
It’s fine. I can teach you.

180
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,430
Like this? Right?

181
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,990
The ancients said, “study with a lady”.

182
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,700
It’s like this, I guess.

183
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,040
<i>Cong Rong</i>

184
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,950
You write it wrong.

185
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,020
You’ve missed a character.

186
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,460
It’s right.

187
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,020
These two characters are better.

188
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:39,030
Wen Shaoqing! Shame on you!

189
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,400
You’ve written Cong Rong
in the family tree

190
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,540
before you marry her.

191
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,980
Don’t you feel ashamed of it?

192
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,980
What is he talking about?

193
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,390
I don’t know.

194
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,950
Please sit, Uncle.

195
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,040
You may sit.

196
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,100
One chair for each person.

197
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,100
You’re dead.

198
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,340
Only this time. Never do it again.

199
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,550
Grandpa, I’ll only marry once.

200
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,740
There won’t be a next time.

201
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,220
There is Cong Rong on it.

202
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,700
Are Wen Qing and Wen Gu some big names?

203
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,640
<i>Wen Qing, Wen Gu</i>
Yeah.

204
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,950
<i>Wen Qing, Wen Gu</i>
Not big names.

205
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,390
My son and daughter to be born.

206
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,350
So soon?

207
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,820
No! It’s not true!

208
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,220
Shaoqing. Don’t talk nonsense.

209
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,460
Yeah. You startled Cong Rong.

210
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,430
I mean it.

211
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,430
Grandpa. Grandma. Dad. Mom.

212
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,580
Uncle.

213
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,220
On this New Year,

214
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,550
I’m back with Cong Rong

215
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,430
to tell you something.

216
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,740
We mean to have babies.

217
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,590
Wen Shaoqing.

218
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,310
Stop blabbering!

219
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,820
She hasn’t agreed, though.

220
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,390
As per the law, we need to get married

221
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,270
before having babies.

222
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,950
I agree.

223
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,590
It’s good.

224
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,860
Great! Great!

225
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,580
We’ll have four generations in our family.

226
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,310
Hurry and set the date.

227
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,670
Book good hotels as soon as possible.

228
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,550
Yeah, list the guests to be invited.

229
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,070

258
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,030
I come to have a check.

259
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,460
You’ve reviewed my thesis for long.

260
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,740
Have you finished it?

261
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,070

Is my thesis lame?

265
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,220
It depends on whose it’s compared with.

266
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,430
I see. I’m gonna rewrite it.

267
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,310
Boss.

268
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,150
Am I the worst student you’ve ever had?

269
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,620
Turn to the last page and have a look.

270
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,150
As a doctor,

271
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,580
he shall be self-aware,

272
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,740
solemn and humble,

273
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,430
magnanimous and upright.

274
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,950
What does it mean?

275
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,430
It describes the proper manners

276
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,220
to be a virtuous and skilled doctor.

277
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,100
He shall be upright and introspective,

278
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,500
dedicated and considerate,

279
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,740
not showing off talents for fame.

280
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,460
Understand?

281
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,100
Yes,

282
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,150
but I’m confused again.

283
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,190
What are you trying to say?

284
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,700
Zhong Zhen, you’re able to graduate.

285
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,980

286
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,620
Pardon?

287
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,820
You are not the worst student
I’ve ever had.

288
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,790
You’ve been hardworking.

289
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,040
Boss, I love you!

290
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,950
Knock it off. Go away.

291
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,390
You love me, but I don’t love you.

292
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,820
You love my cousin. It’s the same thing.

293
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,790

298
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,580
is a good fighter.

299
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,820
Keep the Human Injury

300
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,670

Wish you a good fight
in your marriage life.

302
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,700
Never let go of each other

303
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,500
despite blood and blade.

304
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,390
I’m gonna...

305
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,950
Wrap candies tonight in my place.

306
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,500
You can count on me.

307
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,550
You brat.

308
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,740
All of these are bought by me.

309
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,950

310
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,860

312
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,270
What can I do for you?

313
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,430
No, thanks.

314
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,820
Mrs. Wen, we can take care of these.

315
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,310
Everyone is here. Let me assign you tasks.

316
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,620
Boys fold candy boxes.

317
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,310
Girls put candies in and tie ribbons.

318
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,980
I’ll seal the lids.

319
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,270
Let’s do this.

320
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,310
I have a question.

321
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,700
Make a bowknot or a surgical knot?

322
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,280
My foot.

323
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,000
A surgical knot?

324
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,180
You must be crazy. A surgical knot...

325
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,390
Come on. Hurry up.

326
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,820
Get started,

327
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,950
or candies will be eaten up.

328
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,860
What should I do, Zhong Zhen?

329
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,390
Go away.

330
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,550
How dare you?

331
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,310
My boss doesn’t allow you to work.

332
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,220
Or he’ll beat me up.

333
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,550
Go away.

334
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,670
Don’t ruin my bright future.

335
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,580
Go. Go. Go.

336
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,340
Are you writing wedding invitations?

337
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,070
What’s up?

338
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,180
They drove me here,

339
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,550
not allowing me to do anything.

340
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,190
What is the bride supposed to do?

341
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,340
Wait for the wedding, perhaps.

342
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,710
The couple, Xiao Ziyuan and Sui Yi.

343
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,740
Sounds familiar.

344
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,220
I told you about them,

345
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,710
my cousin and cousin-in-law.

346
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,590
I wrapped candies for them

347
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,860
when they got married.

348
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,460
I remember.

349
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,920
The bride who cried her eyes out

350
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,040
at the wedding.

351
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,740
Yeah.

352
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,280
Few brides don’t cry

353
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,310
on their weddings.

354
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,550
It must be because

355
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,470
they are too happy.

356
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,220
What about you?

357
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,820
Will you cry on our wedding?

358
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,310
I will not.

359
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,190
A sweet fragrance on you.

360
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,220
You stole and ate candies?

361
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,190
You want some?
I’m stealing one for you.

362
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,740
You are my sweetest candy.

This way, please.

401
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,470

Come on.

408
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,510

Cheese!

410
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,590
Nice! Good!

411
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,350
The wedding is so tiring.

412
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,820
My feet are swollen.

413
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,460
I told you to wear flatties.
You didn’t listen.

414
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,300
Come here.

415
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:32,780
Take off your shoes.

416
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,740
Let me give you a massage.

417
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,670
Thanks.

418
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,780
Excuse me, Sir, Miss.

419
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,060
Ten minutes to go.

420
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,200
Take a break now.

421
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,950
We’ll start at 6:18 PM.

422
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,790
When it gets started,

423
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,710
the door will open.

424
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,040
You may go in

425
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,680
when the light is on.

426
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,280
OK.

427
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,070
OK.

428
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,790
Sir.

429
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,200
Please go in now and wait.

430
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,480
You’ll go to the stage from there.

431
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,150
OK. Got it.

432
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,670
OK. I’m going for it.

433
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,740
I’m going there.

434
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,390
See you.

Rong, are you here alone?

437
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,310
Where is Wen Shaoqing?

438
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,070
He just went in.

439
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,960
I saw him run out

440
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,110
from the backstage in a hurry.

441
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,500
I thought he came to you.

442
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,630
He didn’t.

443
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,430
I’m gonna have a look.

444
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,500
Look. He isn’t here.

445
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,460
He didn’t answer the call.

446
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:19,980
Rong.

447
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,230
Are you looking for me? What’s up?

448
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,300
Where is your boss?

449
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,590
I don’t know.

450
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,740
I really don’t.

451
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,430
Tell me or you’re dead.

452
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,300
Rong. Don’t make it hard on me.

453
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,200
Remember.

454
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,040
My boss doesn’t mean to

455
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,430
leave any regret on your wedding.

456
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,190
A double meaning in your words?

457
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,440
Did he go to the hospital

458
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,310
for an emergency?

459
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,260
Was he afraid to irritate me?

460
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,980
I didn’t say that.

461
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,110
Should we put off the wedding?

462
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,540
Nothing good comes easy.

463
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,620
Distinguished guests, friends,

464
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,280
the wedding ceremony is about to begin.

465
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,310
Ladies and gentlemen,

466
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,780
please be patient.

467
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,830
Let’s wait for this happy
and sweet moment

468
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,980
of these two lovebirds.

469
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:18,440
Here she is.

470
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,240
Look, the bride is out.

471
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,790
Is the procedure right?

472
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,260
Let’s see.

473
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,470
What’s going on? Why is Cong Rong alone?

474
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,150
I... I don’t know.

475
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,870
Where is Shaoqing?

476
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,060
Why is she out alone?

477
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,240
Why you came out earlier?

478
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,710
It’s not the time yet.

479
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,910
The groom went to the hospital
for an emergency.

480
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:51,720
What?

481
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,590
Give me the microphone.

482
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,870
Hello, everyone.

483
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,700
Thank you for coming to my wedding.

484
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,980
There are some unexpected situations.

485
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,430
I’d like to explain to you.

486
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:27,220
My love, Wen Shaoqing, is a surgeon.

487
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,430
Being with him,

488
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,700
I can’t remember how many times

489
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,630
he’s gone back to hospital late at night.

490
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,740
It’s the routine of his life.

491
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,780
I used to ask myself

492
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,980
if I’d blame him.

493
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,590
No.

494
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,020
Not even today.

495
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,060
Between the patient
whose life is on the line,

496
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,110
and my wedding,

497
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,700
I choose to back him up.

498
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:55,430
I admire him. I’m proud of him.

499
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,500
I know,

500
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,950
he’s ready for his lancet at any time.

501
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,870
His every brief parting with me

502
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,590
is to help patients on the operating table

503
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,630
so that they can see their families soon.

504
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:12,980
In fact, I almost missed him.

505
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,430
You’re finally here.

506
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,220
I’ve been long waiting for you.

507
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,710
I’m in danger. What is it to do with you?

508
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,070
Who am I to you?

509
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,440
I’ve had a crush on her for decades.

510
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,680
She might not even know I like her.

511
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,870
I said I’ve loved someone for long.

512
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,670
It is you,

513
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,500
the one I’ve been waiting for,

514
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,870
the Swordswoman I’ve been longing for.

515
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,350
I’m Cong Rong in Class 11.

516
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,390
You can call me Swordswoman.

517
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,390
Yet I haven’t told you

518
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,830
I’m Wen Shaoqing from Class 9.

519
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:49,670
See you next term. I’m waiting for you!

520
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,430
A dependable man

521
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,190
shall promise her a lifetime commitment.

522
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,590
Luckily, he’s been waiting for me.

523
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,670
Today is our wedding.

524
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,540
I don’t mind standing here
and waiting for him.

525
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,060
Since I decided to
live the rest of my life with him,

526
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,540
I’ve been wishing

527
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,350
to back him up all my life.

528
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:24,110
Wish I’d never break my word.

529
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,540
I’m doomed. A big mistake.

530
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,870
Boss.

531
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,020
Sorry. Boss.

532
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,480
You said I must not reveal the surprise

533
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,310
to Cong Rong.

534
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,980
So I...

535
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,390
It turned out to be
a big misunderstanding.

536
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,060
You may hit me.

537
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,500
Thanks.

538
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,670
Or I couldn’t have heard these.

539
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,740
Cong Rong.

540
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,830
My apology.

541
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,430
Sorry.

542
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,020
I’ve prepared you a surprise.

543
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,870
I didn’t even tell Zhou Chengcheng.

544
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,060
Don’t be angry with me.

545
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,060
I wrote a song for you,

546
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,720
my very first song.

547
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,740
Don’t know.

548
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,700
I’ve been practicing,

549
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,300
but I still feel nervous.

550
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,190
Pardon me

551
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,350
if I don’t sing it well. Alright?

You said you’ve loved someone for long.

562
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,870
We are childhood sweethearts.

563
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,260
I’ve had a crush on her for decades.

564
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,060
Badly, I can’t have her.

565
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,740
Why are you bullying him?

566
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,390
What are you doing? It hurts! Be gentle.

567
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,590
If you pass,

568
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,870
be my girlfriend.

569
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:09,790
What if I fail?

570
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,830
Then you win.

571
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,980
I’ll lose myself to you,

572
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,540
and be your boyfriend.

573
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,540
If I lose the lawsuit,

574
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,540
I can no longer be a doctor.

575
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,390
Will you still be with me?

576
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,390
I want to protect what is right,

577
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,150
and the ones I care about.

578
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,740
Please protect me then, Miss Cong.

579
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,540
Rest assured.

580
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,220
I won’t allow anything to happen to you.

581
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,700
You are so special.

582
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:13,020
The man I love glows with light,

583
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,190
shiny but not divine.

584
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:20,070
The happiest thing is that

585
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,760
the one you’ve been waiting for

586
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,300
is also waiting for you.

587
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,220
You lied to me.

588
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,460
Do you know the consequence
of lying to a lawyer?

589
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,540
I’m your man anyway.

590
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,980
You can do anything to me.

591
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:18,820
Wen Shaoqing.

592
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,720
The Marriage Law only protects
your property,

593
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,150
not your love.

594
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,700
My love has me

595
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,870
to protect it.

596
00:30:59,240 --> 00:30:59,910
You wake up.

597
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,590
What would you like to eat?

598
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,740
Yogurt ice cream?

599
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,460
OK.

600
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,260
Where did you get it?

601
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:15,780
By magic.

602
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,150
How about going to Iceland
for honeymoon?

603
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,590
No worries about visas and luggage.

604
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,150
You’d like to see Aurora, right?

605
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,780
Wen Shaoqing.

606
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:33,060
I once saw you as a dream, not an ideal.

607
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,110
An ideal can be achieved by hard work,

608
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,630
but a dream is a gift from Heaven.

609
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:43,220
So lucky I am to have you.

610
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,500
Honey.

611
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,060
I love you.

612
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,000
<i>After a few years</i>

613
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,390
About the Daren Law Firm,

614
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,950
I believe you’ve heard a lot about it.

615
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,860
To stay here,
you have to pass the internship.

616
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,390
You’ll draw the lot to decide

617
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,760
which company you will be assigned to.

618
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,020
Thank you, Ms. Cong.

619
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,590
It gives me confidence

620
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,670
that you’ll take this case.

621
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,910
I’m flattered. I’ll go all out for it.

622
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,190
My assistant will talk with you
about contract details.

623
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,110
Keep in touch.

624
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,500
OK. I’ll take my leave.

625
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:30,630
Morning.

626
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,140
Ms. Lucy.

627
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,060
Which company did Ms. Cong go
for internship?

628
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,700
Yun Ji Hospital.

629
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,350
You’re drinking coffee again.

630
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,950
Why can’t I?

631
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,870
You have a poor stomach, don’t you?

632
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,790
You’d better have some milk.

633
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,670
Give it to me.

634
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,630
Do you really like me?

635
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:00,700
Um.

636
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,980
Let’s have dinner tonight.

637
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,390
I said,

638
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,590
let’s have dinner tonight.

639
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,940
<i>Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital</i>

640
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,260
Cong Rong. The result is out.

641
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,780
An unexpected result.

642
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,740
Get mentally prepared.

643
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,220
I’m back.

644
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,590
Go wash your hands.

645
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,620
We have goodies for dinner.

646
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,460
What goodies?

647
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,660
How is it?

648
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,500
You are so kind to me.

649
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,230
You just knew it?

650
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,830
Given your good performance all the time,

651
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,590
I have a big gift for you.

652
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,390
OK.

653
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,750
Gift accepted.

654
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:39,790
What is it?

655
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,790
Wen Qing, Wen Gu.

656
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:47,830
Do you like the gift?

657
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,710
Yes, I like it.

658
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,430
I see.

659
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,600
What’s wrong? What happened at home?

660
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,590
Big news.

661
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,910
I’m gonna be Grandpa.

662
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,870
What?

663
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,390
Wen Shaoqing called me that

664
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,750
Cong Rong is carrying a twin.

665
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,080
Really?

666
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,980
Well... Will I be Grandma?

667
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,160
Not yet,

668
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,350
you haven’t married me.

669
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,310
You’re right.

670
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:32,860
Zhou Chengcheng.

671
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,500
How long have we been traveling?

672
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,390
Two years?

673
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,180
I’m tired somewhat.

674
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,230
How about we make do and get married?

675
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,020
Make do?

676
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,790
What do you mean by that?

677
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,430
You neither propose to me

678
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,230
nor give me a reason to marry you.

679
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,870
A reason? Let me think now.

680
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,500
Got it.

681
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,180
When we are old,
we may sit freely in the yard.

682
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,430
Among the flowers, we listen to the rain.

683
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,660
Under the starry sky, we enjoy the moon.

684
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,910
Cloudy or cloudless,
recall the travel in the south.

685
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:14,540
Every moment of the past.

686
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,430
I’m saying, if you marry me,

687
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,910
our baby will be Uncle once he’s born.

688
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,020
Then we win.

689
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,660
Deal.
