let me tell you,

77
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,260
there is no such saying as “wife” in law.

78
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,090
The correct title should be “spouse”.

79
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,970
In another word,

80
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,800
wife is not protected by law.

81
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,120
Well, I got it.

82
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,240
But my wife should be protected by me.

83
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:57,770

84
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,480

00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,370
So, I’ll replace Cong Rong to appear
in the court.

191
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,730
Besides,

192
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,370
we also talked to the clients.

193
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,220
They also agreed.

194
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,010
Nonsense.

195
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,840
How dare you regard such important work
as a trifling matter?

196
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,650
Where on earth has Cong Rong gone?

197
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,370
She went to Shanghai for evidence.

198
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,540
<i>Cong Rong</i>

199
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,690
You two are good friends.

200
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,370
Go call her back.

201
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,010
Hello,

202
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,410
what do you want for dinner?

203
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,410
I’ll hold a victory party for you.

204
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,800
I’m at the supermarket now.

205
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,410
Bad luck,

206
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,620
after the session is ended,

207
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,560
I’ll go to Shanghai with Mr. Shangguan.

208
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,010
I won’t come back until tomorrow.

209
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,170
It’s so sudden.

210
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,290
Mr. Shangguan

211
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,720
does not sympathize with you at all.

212
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,170
It’s me who insists on going to Shanghai

213
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,650
not Mr. Shangguan.

214
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,010
This is not the first time for me.

215
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:40,890
Relax.

216
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:41,720
OK.

217
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,200
Take good care of yourself.

218
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,100
Send me your flight number.

219
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,200
I’ll go to pick you up.

220
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,580
<i>Mr. Shangguan</i>

221
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,320
Why did you make the decision privately?

222
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,680
Why not discuss with me?

223
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,840
Do you still treat me as your senior?

224
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,280
I know you won’t agree

225
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,570
if I told you.

226
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,080
So you made the decision
before telling me.

227
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,900
Making statement is a hard-won

228
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,090
opportunity for interns.

229
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,650
You just gave it up with ease.

230
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:14,260
I’m sorry.

231
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,080
Mr. Shangguan.

232
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,260
During the case investigation,

233
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,650
I learned a lot.

234
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,200
You gave me step-by-step directions.

235
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,530
That’s the most precious for me.

236
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,080
So, even if I can’t make the statement,

237
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,080
I won’t feel sorry.

238
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:32,960
You give up your future

239
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,200
for Wen Shaoqing like that?

240
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,020
You and he

241
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,860
are two individuals.

242
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,690
As a newbie, you shall be a lawyer first.

243
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,220
Then,

244
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,200
you’re his girlfriend.

245
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,320
Mr. Shangguan.

246
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,530
I know what you did is for my good.

247
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,490
But you’re wrong for one thing.

248
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,890
I’m an individual.

249
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,130
But he

250
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,010
is the one I want to protect.

251
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,860
Sorry, Mr. Shangguan.

252
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,720
I let you down.

253
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:12,490
Shangguan Yi,

254
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,050
why are you here?

255
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:15,490
You know?

256
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,170
She gave up her first court appearance
in her career

257
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,920
just to collect evidence for you.

258
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,250
How could you be so incompetent?

259
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,490
What?

260
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,720
Don’t you know

261
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,130
what an important chance it is for her?

262
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,290
If I were you,

263
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,250
I won’t let her give up the chance for me.

264
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,320
Follow me.

265
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,250
Why are you...?

266
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,770
Where to go?

267
00:12:58,530 --> 00:12:58,980
Stop it.

268
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,890
Return my luggage.

269
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,170
Why are you here?

270
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,200
Cong Rong.

271
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,530
Drop my case.

272
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,010
Let’s settle out of court.

273
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,320
What are you talking about?

274
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,320
I know the whole truth.

275
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,320
You gave up your first court appearance

276
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,130
just to collect evidence for me.

277
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,960
I’ll pay the money

278
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,320
no matter how much it is.

279
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,530
You mean it?

280
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:22,370
I mean it.

281
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,530
Why drop the lawsuit?

282
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,570
I don’t get it.

283
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,960
There is no need to waste time.

284
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,440
It isn’t worth it.

285
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,890
How could it be not worth it?

286
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,250
If you drop the lawsuit,

287
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,500
the people who are unaware of the truth

288
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,160
will think you’re in the wrong.

289
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,050
You admit mistakes.

290
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,320
You’re wrong.

291
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,080
I’m a doctor.

292
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,250
As long as I don’t feel ashamed
before patients

293
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,770
and have a clear conscience,

294
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,170
that’s enough for me.

295
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,080
Wen Shaoqing,

296
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,490
what’s wrong with you?

297
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,920
You ignore obvious matters

298
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,620
and pretend they don’t exist.

299
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,650
Even they’ve wronged you,

300
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,040
you’ll accept it?

301
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,680
It’s not that I accept it.

302
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:03,680
I could ignore it.

303
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,920
But I couldn’t.

304
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,250
What did you tell me
when we first met each other?

305
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,200
You said, a doctor has his own dignity.

306
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,260
As long as you did nothing wrong,

307
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,370
you’d not yield regardless of pressure.

308
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,900
You said, you studied diligently

309
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,920
and cherished your reputation

310
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,250
just to be a good doctor.

311
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,050
Even when you get old,

312
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,290
you’d try to treat patients.

313
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,320
Isn’t it your principle?

314
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,440
I will not let you be treated wrongly.

315
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,130
Even if I’m a stranger to you,

316
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,290
as long as you could get justice,

317
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,370
I would do it.

318
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,440
But I don’t want you to give up
your chance for me.

319
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,320
This is not why I’m with you.

320
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,680
I wouldn’t allow you to give up
your principle either,

321
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,720
even for me.

322
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,780
<i>Agent</i>

323
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,890
Relax.

324
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:36,680
Take it easy.

325
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,200
Mr. Shangguan,

326
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,800
I feel a little giddy.

327
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,170
Thank you, Mr. Shangguan.

328
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,530
<i>Clerk</i>
All rise.

329
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,080
Welcome Chief Judge to his seat.

330
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,010
Be seated.

331
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,010
This court is now in session.

332
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:38,930
Plaintiff lawyer,

333
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:42,740
is your claim consistent with
the written indictment?

334
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,960
Is there any change or supplement
to the facts and reasons?

335
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,650
It’s consistent with the indictment.

336
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,250
No change or supplement.

337
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,410
Now, the plaintiff presents evidence,

338
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:56,440
stating the name of evidence
and all supporting facts.

339
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,800
Your honorable Chief Judge and judges.

340
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,050
I, entrusted by the plaintiff of the case,

341
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,800
act as agent ad litem of Zhang, Li, Yang,

342
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,930
Zhao, Du and Jiang,

343
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,600
and attend the case trial by law.

344
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,060
Now, as for the focus of dispute,

345
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,290
I present the following opinions
based on facts.

346
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,770
You gave up your first court appearance

347
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,820
just to collect evidence for me.

348
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,930
It isn’t worth it.

349
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,840
I will not let you be treated wrongly.

350
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,570
Even if I’m a stranger to you,

351
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,250
as long as you could get justice,

352
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,640
I would do it.

353
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,010
The defendant, Shen,

354
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,860
from August to November 2018,

355
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,250
in the name of doing business together,

356
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,090
used ID card from Zhang,

357
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,320
and borrowed money from multiple lenders,

358
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,120
causing our client to owe
a huge amount of money.

359
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,120
The borrower registered and
uploaded certification materials

360
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,930
for loan application.

361
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,800
In November 2018,

362
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,970
Li submitted the loan application

363
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,160
for RMB 400,000 to the lender.

364
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,820
The lender issued the loan contract.

365
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,050
We claim against the defendant

366
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,960
for returning the principal and interest,

367
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,930
totaling RMB 400,000 to our client.

368
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,900
<i>Futian District People’s Court</i>

369
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,690
Dr. Wen.

370
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,450
Congratulations.

371
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,690
Thank you.

372
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,320
Why are you here?

373
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,400
This is Cong Rong’s first case.

374
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,320
She can’t make the statement in person,

375
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,530

If Cong Rong could be here today,

378
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,640
she would be happier.

379
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,640
Because she’s worked hard for the case.

381

Yes.

You did a great job today.

388
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,250
There’s a lot work to do.

Calm down. Stop it.

395
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,100
He was fine in the morning
but is critically ill now.

396
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,900
Calm down.

397
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,730
Aren’t you a quack?

398
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,250
Stop it.

399
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,330
I’ll submit the evidence to the court.

00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,120
What would happen
if it’s ruled by the court?

403
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,490
Mr. Yao should know it clearly.

404
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,010
So we strongly disagree on

405
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,360
your claim.

406
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:26,380
We accept proper compensation.

407
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,210
But there’s no doubt that

408
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,050
your client caused harm to mine.

409
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,530

hold you accountable.

Well, we’ll also reserve
the right to prosecute.

00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,730
I sincerely hope we could make a deal.

414
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,620
Today’s situation is unexpected,

415
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,050
which is caused by momentary impulse

416
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,640
rather than grudge.

420
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,970

in a responsible manner

there is no doctor in the world

425

if I met you earlier,

00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,120
Not at all.

567
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,290
Cong Rong is totally a different girl
after falling in love.

568
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,570
Mr. Shangguan,

569
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,690
look at them.

570
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,210
When will I meet my Mr. Right?

571
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,640
Mr. Shangguan,

572
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,770
do you admire them?

573
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:48,770
Get off.

574
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:49,970
I’m gonna park the car.

575
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,860
You asked for leave to remove the plaster

576
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,160
but in fact to go dating.

577
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:19,450
I just dropped by.

578
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,490
Envy me?

579
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:21,730
Not at all.

580
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,720
Actually, I win the case the first time
I went to the court.

581
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,690
Do you envy me?

582
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,360
Indeed, I do.

583
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,320
Xiong Jingjing,

584
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,320
thank you for helping me.

585
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,730
You’re so polite

586
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,930
that I could not get used to it.

587
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,690
I know.

588
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:40,900
We win the case

589
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,440
mainly because of you.

590
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,960
But don’t look down upon me.

591
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,800
I’ll score a success on my own next time.

592
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:46,850
Great.

593
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,970
I’ll wait and see.

594
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,730
If you lose…

595
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:50,640
No way.

596
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,580
If I lose, I’ll treat you to a big meal.

597
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,580
That’s the deal.

598
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,330
OK.

599
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,080
Let’s go.

600
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,120
In January 2019,

601
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,530
though I missed the first chance
to go to court,

602
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:05,200
I do not regret.

603
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,900
There’s probably a long way to go

604
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,640
to become a good lawyer

605
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:11,840
but I’m grateful

606
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,210
that I took a step forward.

607
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,420
<i>Mr. Shangguan</i>

608
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:34,650
Mr. Shangguan,

609
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,360
what’s up?

610
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,050
Good news for you.

611
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,490
The case is officially withdrawn.

612
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,450
Is it true?

613
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,290
Great.

614
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,340
Director Yan,

615
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,380
your punishment is canceled.

616
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,170
Really?

617
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,720
Then I can restore my work tomorrow.

618
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,820
If your colleagues know your return,

619
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,890
they’ll be over the moon.

620
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,250
No, they should be the other way around.

621
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,090
What about the hospital?

622
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:58,250
Based on the investigation result,

623
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:00,450
Yun Ji did nothing illegal.

624
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,800
Luckily, the patient regained
consciousness.

625
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,800
His family also came to
realize the truth.

626
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:06,900
That’s great.

627
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,850
It’s a good day.

628
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,160
When you come back,

629
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,540
we’ll throw you a welcome party.

630
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,690
Thank you, Director Yan.

631
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,740
<i>Good News</i>

632
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,620
<i>Girlfriend</i>

633
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,080
You knew it.

634
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,210
Of course.

635
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,250
I got the first-hand news.

636
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,930
Thank you,

637
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,120
Miss Cong.

638
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,730
You’re welcome,

639
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:40,690
Dr. Wen.

640
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,770
Let’s bring everyone together
and celebrate tonight.

641
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:44,640
OK.

642
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,250
Rong.

643
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:58,620
Rong.

644
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,530
Hello, everyone.

645
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,250
What are we going to eat?

646
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,060
How about hot pot?

647
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:02,730
OK.

648
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:03,640
Fine with me.

649
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,080
To enjoy the big meal,

650
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,210
I’ll be a couple with Chengcheng.

651
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,090
So none of us are a third wheel.

652
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:09,880
Perfect.

653
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:10,730
Leave me alone.

654
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:11,970
Go to get someone else.

655
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,860
There are crowds of guys pursuing me.

656
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,160
You have no chance.

657
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,770
Let’s go.

658
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:17,930
Wait a minute.

659
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,360
There is another person.

660
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,290
Who?

661
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,290
Isn’t he the Boss’s uncle?

662
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,840
What brings you here?

663
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,820
You go back to work.

664
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,620
As your uncle,

665
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,050
I should come to celebrate it.

666
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,010
Uncle,

667
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,840
no matter why you are here,

668
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,900
in a world featuring
public display of affection,

669
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,400
we can team up to enjoy hot pot.

670
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,170
Sorry,

671
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,050
I have a teammate.

672
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,210
He’s pursuing me

673
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,210
but I haven’t said yes.

674
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,050
The world is so crazy.

675
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,970
Blood curd.

676
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:03,600
OK.

677
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,450
What kind?

678
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,170
Pig or ox?

679
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:06,730
Pig.

680
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,050
No.

681
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,360
Crab sticks for Chengcheng.

682
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,530
Beef and mutton.

683
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:14,380
I wanna...

684
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,730
Both beef and mutton.

685
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,530
Special beef.

686
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:18,010
OK.

687
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:18,540
Order me a...

688
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,060
How much should I order?

689
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:19,970
One for each.

690
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:20,690
People like you

691
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,050
are not clever.

692
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:25,400
Miss,

693
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,970
bring me a bear.

694
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:28,720
Wait a minute.

695
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,820
Sugar-coated haws for each.

696
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,210
Strawberry hawthorn.

697
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,000
Two dishes of thousand-layered tripe.

698
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,490
I noticed

699
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,540
there is no plain broth.

700
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,780
Hello, here is the bear.

701
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,320
Thank you.

702
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,680
Only the double-flavor hot pot
is available.

703
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,250
Tofu sheet slices.

704
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,400
Your perfect matching

705
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,490
leaves no space for me.

706
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,450
You need no space.

707
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,640
Lettuce, potato, yam, white gourd;
one dish for each.

708
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:48,690
Well.

709
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:50,540
Thank you.

710
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,720
Seems you’re recovered mentally.

711
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,770
I need to thank you for your tricks.

712
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,140
It’s you who fooled me.

713
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,960
Obviously, you’re anxious

714
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,360
and saw nothing.

715
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,120
Fortunately, adopting the right trick
is my strength.

716
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,600
So, you’re welcome.

717
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,050
What are you talking about?

718
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,810
I mean,

719
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:12,120
the four of us could play cards.

720
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,200
Four?

721
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,490
Four of us?

722
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,600
I haven’t said yes.

723
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,160
But you will soon.

724
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,210
Do you think I’m nobody?

725
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,360
I’ll go get sauce.

726
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:26,250
Sit down.

727
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:26,930
Let me do it.

728
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,050
I go get it as well.

729
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,770
Well, let me get one for you.

730
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:40,480
Uncle,

731
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,170
take this.

732
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:41,340
OK.

733
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,080
Thank you.

734
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,490
I can’t call you uncle anymore.

735
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:48,450
Chengcheng is a sister to me.

736
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:50,600
So you’re my brother.

737
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,780
Boss is also my brother.

738
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,100
Wen Rang.

739
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:53,640
Chili.

740
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,050
They you two will be brothers.

741
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,360
But that’s wrong.

742
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,160
Boss,

743
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,810
Wen Rang is your uncle,

744
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,770
so Chengcheng is your aunt-in-law.

745
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:08,880
Boss.

746
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,290
In this way,

747
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,800
you need to call me uncle.

748
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,330
If I call you like that,
do you have the gut to say “yes”?

749
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,090
You like him so much.

750
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:26,440
Why don’t you accept him?

751
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,600
Why do you keep him guessing?

752
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,850
It’s not true.

753
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:31,850
What is not true?

754
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,370
Our affection.

755
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,120
Although I like him,

756
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,970
I never expected him to like me.

757
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:40,530
You pursued him hardly

758
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:42,010
to be with him, didn’t you?

759
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:42,660
Well,

760
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,970
now you start to doubt your affection?

761
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,650
Do you think

762
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,810
he and I are cut from the same cloth?

763
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,210
Even now I still have no idea

764
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:52,250
why he chose me but not Jiang Yao.

765
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,490
Have you told what you thought to him?

766
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,730
You were not indecisive before.

767
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:00,660
Even a specialist needs to inquire
before making a diagnosis.

768
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,090
Well,

769
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,170
you need to make it clear

770
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,370
but not guessing without ground.

771
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:05,970
Thank you.

772
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,050
Try mine

773
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:09,010
to see which one is better.

774
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,010
What are you going to do?

775
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,810
Isn’t it for me?

776
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,370
No.

777
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,890
Seasoning platform is over there.

778
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:23,490
Shouldn’t you prepare the sauce

779
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:24,930
and bring it to me?

780
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,970
I don’t know your taste.

781
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:28,450
You’d better prepare it by yourself.

782
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,160
Pass me the oyster sauce.

783
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:40,930
It’s boiling.

784
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,740
It’s boiling. Come.

785
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,600
Enjoy it.

786
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,760
Enjoy it.

787
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,490
Try mine?

788
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,490
No need.

789
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,600
I didn’t prefer green onion.

790
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,760
Make way. I’ll go get the sauce.

791
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:55,330
Seems you’re not recovered totally.

792
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:56,050
That’s right.

793
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,300
Try the lettuce.

794
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,560
Since when, she didn’t eat green onion?

795
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:00,890
Not yet done.

796
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:06,450
Well,

797
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,180
take a look.

798
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,380
This is my favorite sauce.

799
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,370
Prepare it for me like this.

800
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:10,720
Stand up.

801
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:20,930
Not bad.

802
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,490
How to prepare it?

803
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:28,810
Shouldn’t you figure it out?

804
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:29,970
Do you expect me to tell you?

805
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,090
OK.

806
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:31,970
Anyway, I’m literate.

807
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,050
Cong Rong.

808
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,300
This beverage seems delicious.

809
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,330
Let me pour you some.

810
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,410
OK.

811
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,240
OK.

812
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,010
I want some too.

813
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,220
You can’t.

814
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:42,860
You have stomach trouble.

815
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:43,490
Drink tea.

816
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,340
You’ve finally finished.

817
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,180
They went away.

818
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,050
If you don’t come out,
I’ll go to find you.

819
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:03,130
Well,

820
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,330
my sauce recipe.

821
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,280
No ghost words.

822
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,080
Wen Rang,

823
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,850
is it true that you want to be with me?

824
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,120
Does it seem that I’m teasing you?

825
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,330
Yes, it does.

826
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:22,180
And I can’t feel your affection to me.

827
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,850
How could you feel it?

828
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,610
I’m in my 30s.

829
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,970
I have no idea what you like or dislike.

830
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:31,330
How about making a list for me,
like this one?

831
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,160
OK.

832
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:42,930
Well…

833
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,780
<i>Tips for pursuing me. Keep them in mind.
Follow it strictly.</i>

834
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,930
Let me have a look.

835
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:50,810
1. Everyday morning call.

836
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:53,930
2. A bunch of flowers every week.

837
00:37:54,570 --> 00:38:00,080
3. At least 2hrs phone talks every day.

838
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:06,860
4. Shopping, dating and dining.
What are these?

839
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,900
So many rules.

840
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,680
What?

841
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,170
You don’t want to follow them?

842
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,330
Never mind.

843
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,160
Bye.

844
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,130
Wen Rang is indeed

845
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:22,050
a straight man.

846
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,080
Zhou Chengcheng will suffer greatly.

847
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,760
You don’t understand.

848
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,530
Wen Rang is a sly old fox.

849
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,120
He’s just playing dumb.

850
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,280
Maybe Zhou Chengcheng can’t
stop being teased.

851
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:36,640
Really?

852
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,370
Why do you like such thing?

853
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,520
Totally girlish.

854
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,130
Right.

855
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,220
I’m shallow.

856
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:42,930
I’m a shadow girl,

857
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:43,740
so stop liking me.

858
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,640
Stop following me.

859
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,050
No way.

860
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,250
Although it’s hard for me,

861
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,970
I can fulfill the last one.

862
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,370
What’s the last one?

863
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,330
Why don’t you follow the sequence?

864
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,050
I wrote so many.

865
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:20,930
Some more?

866
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,080
OK.

867
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,410
I mean these instructions.

868
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,930
How could you treat me like this?

869
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,160
A cunning fox.

870
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,440
Then, I’m off.

871
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,260
Wait, you’re pursuing me,

872
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,770
so won’t you send me home?

873
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,080
I haven’t accepted you.
