<i>My Little Happiness</i>

00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:43,020
<i>Episode 26</i>

31
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:52,840
What’s the laugh about?

32
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,850
Wen Rang is indeed

33
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:56,920
a straight man.

34
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,000
Zhou Chengcheng

35
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,170
will suffer greatly.

36
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,120
You don’t understand.

37
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,970
Wen Rang is a sly old fox.

38
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,480
He’s just playing dumb.

39
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,250
Maybe Zhou Chengcheng can’t

40
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,610
stop being teased.

41
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:11,920
Really?

42
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,130
The truth of relationship is

43
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,130
that it’s like playing games.

44
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,480
Beating the game too easily

45
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,520
means less fun.

46
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,050
I’d say three days at most.

47
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,810
That’s why you are flirting with me

48
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,170
but not confessing.

49
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,490
Tell me then.

50
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,920
How much longer will you play the game?

51
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,460
It’s been over three days.

52
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,850
Now we’re heading towards three months.

53
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,730
The biggest virtue of my family is

54
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,450
that we’re blessed with the best genes.

55
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,640
Do you know what

56
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,730
the best of the best is?

57
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,080
Is it flirting?

58
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,520
To start carefully for a happy ending.

59
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,610
The beauty of love is that

60
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,610
it withstands the test of reality.

61
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,570
After I was suspended,

62
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,640
you didn’t hesitate to protect me.

63
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,850
I was moved.

64
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,730
I wish we could hold hands together

65
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,640
till our hair turns grey.

66
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,680
The best virtue of our family is

67
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,680
that we start carefully for a happy ending.

68
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:42,170
I wish we could hold hands together

69
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,680
till our hair turns grey.

71
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,500

72

<i>Wen Shaoqing: I’ll give you a ride,
Miss Cong.</i>

73
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:10,300
<i>No, let me. You’ve been off work for long.</i>
<i>I didn’t have the fun of giving a ride.</i>

74
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:16,460
<i>Wen Shaoqing: All right.</i>

75
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,260
<i>Go sleep. See you tomorrow.
No, in seven hours. Good night.</i>

76
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,420
<i>Your babe goes to sleep now</i>

77
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,970
It’s just 11 PM.

78
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,850
Not too late.

79
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,170
Aren’t we going to meet in seven hours?

80
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,730
Miss Cong, you knocked the door

81
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,930
of a single man in pajamas at midnight.

82
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:03,920
What do you want?

83
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,500
Can I send you my attorney’s letter

84
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,000
for harassment?

85
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,290
I’m here for medical advice.

86
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,210
Can you prescribe some sleeping pills?

87
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,800
I can’t fall asleep.

88
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:13,800
Sleeping problem.

89
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,170
It’s about the storage of Yang energy.

90
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,530
What is that?

91
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,400
Huangdi Neijing says, in the cold days

92
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,010
when water freezes, one needs to

93
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,460
sleep early and get up late

94
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,560
after sunrise to store Yang energy and

95
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,850
stay calm. To put it simply,

96
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,200
Yang energy is stored in your body.

97
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,460
Your mind is affected due to mood changes.

98
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,770
So what is my problem?

99
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,650
Tell me!

100
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,240
I mean…

101
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,530
I have to warn you. Don’t seduce me.

102
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,200
I didn’t.

103
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,610
I just can’t fall asleep.

104
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,610
You pervert.

105
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,620
You’re here for my medical advice.

106
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,000
How can I walk away?

107
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,850
Come on in.

108
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,240
Lie down.

109
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,560
Close your eyes.

110
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,210
What’s this?

111
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,170
ASMR for white noise.

112
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,000
ASMR means
the autonomous sensory meridian response.

113
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,680
It’s visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory

114
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,800
or sensory stimulation which

115
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,920
induces a special and pleasing sensation

116
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,000
inside your head,

117
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,970
on your scalp or

118
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,360
other parts of body

119
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,290
to help you sleep better.

120
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,410
You worked too hard and

121
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,120
didn’t get enough sleep.

122
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,800
That’s why your cortex
was too stretched.

123
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,290
So when you’re relaxed,

124
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,240
you find it difficult to sleep.

125
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:05,880
After we get married,

126
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,090
I’ll give you head massage every night.

127
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,650
Who’s going to marry you?

128
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,090
Why did I sleep here?

129
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,240
Are you awake?

130
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,770
Go brush your teeth

131
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,320
and have some breakfast.

132
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,560
-Welcome back, Boss!
-Welcome back, Boss!

133
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,170
-Good morning, Mrs. Wen!
-Good morning, Mrs. Wen!

134
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:34,930
Zhong Zhen,

135
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,020
what’re you doing here so early?

136
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,680
To welcome Boss back for work.

137
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:39,800
Rong,

138
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,440
don’t tell me you’re wounded again.

139
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,650
Nope.

140
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,290
When I was brushing teeth,

141
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,290
the water was off.

142
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,290
So I came to ask him,

143
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,080
and found it only happened to me.

144
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,220
I might have accidentally switched it off.

145
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,490
I need to go back and check.

146
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,620
Are you looking for Wen Shaoqing?

147
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,500
He’s there.

148
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,050
Go ahead.

149
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,960
Are they going to gossip at hospital?

150
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:17,650
Come on in.

151
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,050
Bye, Boss.

152
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:44,410
See you.

153
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:44,960
All right.

154
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,370
Bye.

155
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,720
You did it on purpose.

156
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:03,840
How come?

157
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,650
They came here to welcome me back.

158
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:06,920
I knew it just now.

159
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,840
I don’t buy it.

160
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,560
Do you have any evidence to prove

161
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,530
I did it on purpose?

162
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,290
I don’t.

163
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,220
So be it.

164
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,250
You always talked about

165
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,210
the principle of “burden of proof”.

166
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,450
I did talk about that.

167
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,860
But there’s an exception “reverse onus”.

168
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,740
That is to say,

169
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,050
if I think you’re the suspect,

170
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,650
but you can’t prove you didn’t do it,

171
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,620
then it’s assumed

172
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,140
my claim is justified.

173
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,260
How rational you are!

174
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,440
I’m always rational.

175
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,770
It doesn’t work.

176
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,530
Everybody saw it.

177
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,900
We’re all grown-ups.

178
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,050
They can understand.

179
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,380
You… You did it on purpose.

180
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:38,860
You did it

181
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,380
on purpose,

182
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:39,980
on purpose…

183
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,220
Calm down.

184
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,530
Do you need CPZ?

185
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,800
What’s that?

186
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,900
It’s a kind of sedative drug

187
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,570
for schizophrenics and other psychos.

188
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,570
You’re crazy.

189
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,600
Craziness isn’t mental disorder.

190
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,290
I… I’m fine.

191
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,340
Go on.

192
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,200
I need to go.

193
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,170
Bye, Rong.

194
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,650
I’ve never seen her like this.

195
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,800
You’ve never seen many sides of her.

196
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,530
I grew up with her.

197
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,010
You’ve never seen lots of sides, either.

198
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,500
I left my phone at your home.

199
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,170
I’m here to get it back.

200
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,680
Since you know so much,

201
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,770
let’s go talk about your paper.

202
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,290
Oh, please. Boss, I’m busy.

204
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,170
Dr. Wen, you’re back!

205
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,370
I miss you so much.

206
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,490
It’s just a few days.

207
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,530
Stop exaggerating.

208
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,850
By the way,

209
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,720
there’s a fruit basket on your table.

210
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,100
All right.

211
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,730
Thank you.

212
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,010
Give me some if you can’t finish.

213
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:48,980
Sure thing.

214
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,340
OK.

215
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,040
Bye.

216
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,770
Bye.

218
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,380
Look at you.

219
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,530
You look pretty well.

220
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,530
What about you?

221
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,800
Seems you’re blessed with night shifts.

222
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,770
Let’s go.

223
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,450
There’s a mess

224
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,490
for you to clean up.

Good morning!

00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,440
What’s the emergency so early?

228
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,320
Sandwich for you!

229
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,130
And flowers!

230
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,130
Oh, wow, finally!

231
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,650
Are you happy?

232
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:32,410
Yes.

233
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,170
I am.

234
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,680
There’s more.

235
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,330
Are we hanging out?

236
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,100
Let’s go.

237
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,800
Go!

238
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:55,720
Having fun?

239
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,080
Having fun?

240
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,650
It’s not fun at all.

241
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,080
If I knew it’s so tiring,

242
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,320
I would have thrown it away.

243
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,810
Are you all right?

244
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,330
Don’t talk to me.

245
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,570
Why did you bring me here?

246
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,770
What do you want?

247
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,600
If you think I’m over weighted,

248
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,490
tell me directly.

249
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,690
Do you want a piggyback?

250
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:18,440
No.

251
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,050
Then hold my hand.

252
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,370
No.

253
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,200
I can walk.

254
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,020
You’re annoying.

255
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,290
It’s scary.

256
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,080
I’m worn out.

257
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:37,840
I’m also tired.

258
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,720
You…

259
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,720
Why did you bring me all the way here?

260
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,500
What’s it for?

261
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,490
To sit here.

262
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,600
To sit here?

263
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,770
We drove a long way,

264
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,840
and walked so far

265
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,440
just to sit here?

266
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,290
Yeah.

267
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,530
To sit here.

268
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,200
Do you often come here

269
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,370
for hiking when you’re free?

270
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,250
Sometimes.

271
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,560
With whom?

272
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,890
Flowers, grasses, birds, insects,

273
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,080
mountain breezes and clouds.

274
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,720
Did you get

275
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,250
your poetry inspiration here?

276
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:23,960
Try it.

277
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,990
It tastes so good.

278
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,590
That’s the tea from mountains.

279
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,350
Is it sweet?

280
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,060
It’s mountain dew.

281
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,080
Does it take so much time?

282
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,870
The Classic of Tea says,

283
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,830
spring water is the best, river water

284
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:49,110
is the second,
and well water is the worst.

285
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,940
So I collected the dew at 3 AM,

286
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,670
put it in a jar

287
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,510
and buried it three feet
under the ground.

288
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,390
It took you so much effort.

289
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,150
I need to take small sips.

290
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,820
I’m kidding.

291
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,910
I always wanted to do this,

292
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,180
but I haven’t tried yet.

293
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,140
It’s the tea from mountains,

294
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,320
but the water is

295
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,230
just mineral water.

296
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,320
But

297
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,620
if you’re in a different mood,

298
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,150
the tea tastes different as well.

299
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,540
It’s just like the views here.

300
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,300
They’re not great mountains.

301
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,750
But the unique views are something

302
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,940
I want to share with you.

303
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,350
Wen Rang.

304
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,060
What?

305
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,990
Look, we’re totally different.

306
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,900
You’re gentle, while I’m restless.

307
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,180
You’re calm, while I’m short-tempered.

308
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,590
You think about the state of mind.

309
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,350
I follow the nose.

310
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,230
About us being together,

311
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,510
have you really thought about it?

312
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,270
You and I are quite different.

313
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,350
You’re very spontaneous.

314
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,670
You go all out for the things you like,

315
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,470
and stay far away from the things

316
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,590
you dislike.

317
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:33,230
You’re a free spirit.

318
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,480
So you don’t judge or

319
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,540
restrain others.

320
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,960
I feel quite relaxed

321
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:42,870
when I’m with you.

322
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:46,660
That’s it?

323
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,630
There’s another big reason.

324
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,180
For me,

325
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,780
you’re who you are.

326
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,230
The one and only.

327
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,180
It’s all done?

328
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,630
Did you drink?

329
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:47,700
Yeah.

330
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,660
I was happy.

331
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,740
Zhang and others gave us gifts.

332
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,700
What gift?

333
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:56,980
A love letter.

334
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,980
<i>Miss Cong, we love you.</i>
You’ve got so many confessions.

335
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,790
I can’t compete with you.

336
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,590
I used to think

337
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,590
it must be romantic if

338
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,350
I get a love letter from the boy I love.

339
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,740
What about now?

340
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,790
Now?

341
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,400
Now everyone uses internet.

342
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,700
Who would write a love letter by hand?

343
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,940
Stop looking at it.

344
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,390
Let’s go watch a movie.

345
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,310
We haven’t dated for long.

346
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,550
Let’s go.

347
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,590
Hello?

348
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:33,920
OK.

349
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,590
I got it.

350
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,150

You’re all clear about the situation.

358
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,420
It’s very critical.

359
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,550
As a key provincial hospital,

360
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,460
we need to send a rescue team there.

361
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,790
We don’t have much time.

362
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,500
Let’s get a list.

363
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,180
I’ll go.

364
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:12,960
I’ll go.

365
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,510
Me too.

366
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,420
Count me in.

367
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,550
Director,

368
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,790
let me go there.

369
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,420
Dr. Li has two severe cases.

370
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,180
Dr. Zhao is too old

371
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,070
to travel around.

372
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,260
I’m young.

373
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,740
I just came back. I’m not occupied.

374
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,980
So leave it to me.

375
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,740
I’ll go, too.

376
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:32,700
Director,

377
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,790

Dijing is my hometown?

571
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,350
You never talked about it.

572
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,440
I was born there and

573
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,740
stayed there for just a couple of years.

574
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,420

This time,

00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,980
I heard from my relatives that

00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,480
it was seriously damaged.

00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,590

00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,030
Although they’re skiing goggles,

678
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,110
they can protect you from dust.

679
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,220
And the most important one!

680
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,670
A big protective suit!

681
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,280
Look!

682
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,700
It has the print of an astronaut.

683

With the protection of all these stuffs,

684
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,700

Are you sure you will find him?

697
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,380
It’s a big area.

698
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:31,280
I may not be able to find him, but

699
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,960
when I think we’re at the same place,

700
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,320
doing the same things,

701
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,660
I feel safe and assured.

702
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,070
As long as I can help him a little bit,

703
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,700
I’ll be satisfied.

704
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:42,030
You’re so deeply in love with him.

705

I really miss him.

706
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,590
I was cleaning the room the other day,

707
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,910
I saw all the memories about us.

708
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,470
But now I don’t hear anything about him.

709
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,030
I don’t know what to do

710
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,860
if anything bad happens to him.

711
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,590
Think about it.

712
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,830
Wen Shaoqing is such a smart guy.

713
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:09,000
Even if anything happens,

714
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,360
he will protect himself

715
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,950
and make it through.

716
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,030
Let me stay here with you

717
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,920
to pack your luggage together.

718
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,630
OK.

719
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,960
But you have to take it.

720
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,840
I spent so much time to prepare.

721
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,910
Put my clothes in my bag first.
