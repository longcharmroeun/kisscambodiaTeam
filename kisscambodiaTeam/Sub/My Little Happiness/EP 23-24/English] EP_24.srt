<i>Episode 24</i>

3
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,630
Rong, are you gonna finish that?

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,150
You can have it.

5
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,270
Thanks.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,710
Zhong Zhen,

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,630
are you a pig?

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,700
She hasn’t had any.

9
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,150
She wouldn’t eat it,

10
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,300
so I’m doing her a favor.

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,390
Have some soup then.

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,580
Thanks.

13
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,860
Boss,

14
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,620
I want it, too.

15
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,310
It’s in the kitchen.

16
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,020
Go get it yourself.

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:56,740
OK.

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,110
So, my place or yours for tonight?

19
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,280
It’s just a fracture.

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,280
I’m not disabled.

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,030
Zhong Zhen

22
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,360
can stay and look after me.

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,830
He needs to study for his exam.

24
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,860
Don’t waste his time.

25
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,030
Zhong Zhen.

26
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,580
Yeah?

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,990
What’s the Epsilon Wave?

28
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,900
How does it show on ECG?

29
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,830
It’s

30
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,620
a blip buried in the end
of the QRS complex.

31
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,460
RV...

32
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,550
Boss, is this really necessary?

33
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:37,670
You don’t know?

34
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,780
Then what are you still doing here?

35
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,300
Got it.

36
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,390
I’m going back to study.

37
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,960
Rong,

38
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,590
I’m off.

39
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,860
See you tomorrow.

40
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,110
Zhong Zhen,

41
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,640
don’t you dare move!

42
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,960
Is one night enough to pass the exam?

43
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:00,920
I mean,

44
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,530
isn’t it wrong

45
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,650
for you to leave but make your boss

46
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,480
stay and look after me?

47
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,410
How is it wrong?

48
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,700
It’s a man’s duty

49
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,610
to take care of his girlfriend.

50
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,020
Everyone at work knows he’s decent.

51
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,860
Zhong Zhen,

52
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,140
it’s 6:57 PM.

53
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,580
If you don’t get out by 7:00 PM...

54
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,450
On it.

55
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,650
Rong,

56
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,610
sorry.

57
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,010
I’ll come by tomorrow.

58
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,520
Come here and finish your soup.

59
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,890
What’s your decision?

60
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:47,960
Wen Shaoqing,

61
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,690
I can take care of myself.

62
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,290
Unlike last time,

63
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,240
this little fracture

64
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,690
won’t put me in a coma, right?

65
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,240
Medically speaking, no.

66
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,880
But personally speaking,

67
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,480
I suggest you get help.

68
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,650
See?

69
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,770
I have another hand.

70
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:05,920
I’m perfectly fine on my own.

71
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,320
What’s taking you so long?

72
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,920
Do you need a hand?

73
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:41,650
No.

74
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,730
I’m almost done.

75
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,800
Don’t wet your hand.

76
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,480
I know.

77
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,090
Does your stomach hurt?

78
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,000
No.

79
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,170
Then why are covering it?

80
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,320
Nothing.

81
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:38,620
Hey,

82
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,500
I can tie it for you.

83
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,360
No need.

84
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,000
I’m going to bed anyway.

85
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,970
Don’t be shy.

86
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,880
Come on.

87
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,560
All done?

88
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,290
What are you doing?

89
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,210
Making a hard knot.

90
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,650
This is insane!

91
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,970
How am I supposed to
untie it and take off my robe?

92
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:35,680
Give me a shout.

93
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,480
I’ll untie the knot I tied.

94
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,450
Are you gonna take it off now?

95
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,920
Oh, shut up!

96
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,770
Your shadow and the moonlight

97
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,680
remind me of a poem.

98
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,110
What is it?

99
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,750
“In the clear moonlight,

100
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,710
spring flowers are quiet.

101
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,560
The moon seems to be within reach.

102
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,110
But the moon goddess can’t be found”.

103
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,720
I’m surprised that you’ve read

104
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,660
Romance of the Western Chamber.

105
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,270
There’s more.

106
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,900
I’m all ears.

107
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,910
“Dancer’s waist...”

108
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,750
God, make it stop!

109
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,950
I’ve heard enough.

110
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,750
It’s dirty.

111
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,580
Done.

112
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,710
It’s dry.

113
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,780
You can go to sleep.

114
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,560
What about you?

115
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,090
I’ll be right outside.

116
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:13,770
You can take

117
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,890
the guest room.

118
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,080
I can’t hear you there.

119
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,250
Don’t worry about me.

120
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,260
Last time, while I slept in the bedroom,

121
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,490
you were outside, too.

122
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,800
Hope that won’t happen again.

123
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,050
Knock it off!

124
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,050
Get out!

125
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:27,980
Are you sure you don’t need company?

126
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,840
No, no, no.

127
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:29,770
Out!

128
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,900
<i>Supreme People’s Court
on Personal Injury Compensation</i>

129
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,460
<i>The former refers to
the rights to life, health, body...</i>

130
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,220
<i>Supreme People’s Court
on Personal Injury Compensation</i>

131
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,560
May I come in?

132
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,890
The door’s open.

133
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,680
It hurts, doesn’t it?

134
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,200
Yeah, a little bit.

135
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,650
The cast looks fine.

136
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,530
It’s normal to feel the pain.

137
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,140
Why are you still up

138
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,370
this late?

139
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,980
I guess it’s about time

140
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,860
for the painkiller to wear off.

141
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,050
If it’s really bad,

142
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,320
take another one.

143
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,600
I’ll go get water.

144
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:23,690
It’s hot.

145
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,560
Hold on a sec.

146
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,290
OK.

147
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,130
Has anyone called you old-school?

148
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,890
Is that good or bad?

149
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,890
Neither.

150
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:41,530
Sometimes, I feel as if
I were reliving the past.

151
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,220
Did someone else do the same to you?

152
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,130
Yeah.

153
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:53,890
My dad.

154
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,170
Are you aware of a psychological theory

155
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,770
that if you and your father are close,

156
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,200
you’ll tend to marry someone like him?

157
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,840
You are like him.

158
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,860
Take the pill

159
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,290
before it melts.

160
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,320
Aren’t you gonna
sue them for injuring you?

161
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,640
It’s hard

162
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,770
to identify the motive

163
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,410
that whether it’s intentional or not.

164
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,770
My words against theirs.

165
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,200
No one wins in the end.

166
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,490
Better let it slide.

167
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,250
What happened to your hand?

168
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:04,560
I got burned.

169
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,290
Nothing serious.

170
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,260
What happened?

171
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,290
Did you put on the ointment?

172
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,770
I panicked this afternoon

173
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,890
when I heard you were injured.

174
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,840
I was nervous

175
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,650
when putting you in a cast.

176
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,800
That was the first time in years.

177
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,440
Cong Rong.

178
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,600
Yeah?

179
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,490
When you hit your head,

180
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,010
my heart almost stopped.

181
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,370
Here?

182
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,370
The longer we’re together,

183
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:54,800
the more fear I have.

184
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,320
All I’m asking for

185
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,800
is to see the love of my life

186
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,440
healthy

187
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,770
and safe.

188
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,410
Rong,

189
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,960
what happened to your hand?

190
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,890
It’s really no big deal.

191
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,280
The cast can be removed
in three to four weeks.

192
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,050
Relax.

193
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,720
That’s not the point.

194
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,720
What is it then?

195
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,500
When I called your phone
early this morning,

196
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,770
Wen Shaoqing answered it.

197
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,600
Here are the highlights:

198
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,920
“early this morning”,

199
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,440
“your phone”,

200
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,250
“Wen Shaoqing answered it”.

201
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,890
You two slept together last night?

202
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,130
What are you talking about?

203
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:34,810
Be honest with me.

204
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,770
The sooner the better.

205
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:41,930
Hey,

206
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,170
untie it for me.

207
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,800
That’s...

208
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,170
Quite a complicated knot.

209
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,440
How could you manage it?

210
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,600
I just did.

211
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,200
It looks familiar, though.

212
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,890
Isn’t it the Surgeon’s Knot?

213
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,140
Wen Shaoqing did it, didn’t he?

214
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:02,860
You two must’ve...

215
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,530
No.

216
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,530
Nothing happened between us.

217
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,050
OK?

218
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,600
How did you know that knot?

219
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,800
I see stuff.

220
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,080
Oh, save it.

221
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,260
I’ve been watching a medical drama

222
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,560
and got it from there.

223
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,730
It also features a male surgeon.

224
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,680
He’s hot!

225
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,130
I suddenly get it.

226
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,010
Get what?

227
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,560
I get why girls love dating doctors.

228
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,530
They’re professional and charming.

229
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,490
Of course the look matters, too.

230
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,650
Here’s my hubby,

231
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,970
Dr. Romantic, Kang Dong-Joo.

232
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,890
And this is our
marriage certificate photo.

233
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,520
You’re a hardcore fan.

234
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,440
I wish you a happy marriage!

235
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,570
Hey,

236
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:40,930
come

237
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:41,840
and untie the knot now.

238
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,050
Rong,

239
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,340
listen,

240
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,410
a man’s head and a woman’s waist

241
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,410
are private.

242
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,140
Did anything happen

243
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,170
when Wen Shaoqing made this knot?

244
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,330
Are you done?

245
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:06,960
Thanks.

246
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,920
I’ll go get changed.

247
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,080
You can tell me anything.

248
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,250
Besides,

249
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,600
you two have settled down, right?

250
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,890
Even if you guys did it,

251
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,170
I’m totally fine with it.

252
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,440
Enough about me.

253
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,490
I can ask Zhong Zhen
to set you up with a doctor.

254
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:32,680
Sounds good,

255
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,960
but no.

256
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,130
I’m already in love with my new hubby.

257
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,920
I don’t need another date.

258
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,800
Where...? Where are you going?

259
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,080
Why are you wearing a suit?

260
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,320
I’m going to work.

261
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,050
What?

262
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,580
Your hand is broken.

263
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,730
Forget about work.

264
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,340
Just take a few days off.

265
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,080
The online loan case
is going to court soon.

266
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,410
Files for the cross-examination
are yet to be submitted.

267
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,450
I can’t afford

268
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,400
to rest at the moment.

269
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,080
Can you even work like this?

270
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:15,920
Oh, no.

271
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,640
The cast is stuck into my sleeve.

272
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,010
Roll it up.

273
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,970
I can never say no to you.

274
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,900
Sorry, sorry.

275
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,840
Easy, easy.

276
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,490

Rong,

280
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,370

What do you mean?

282
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,240
Look,

<i>Wen Shaoqing</i>
here’s your master’s signature.

284
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,360
When...? When did he do that?

285
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,930
When you were asleep, of course.

286
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,640
Let me see.

287
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:49,880
This is him.

288
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,210
And this is you.

289
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,730
Here’s his dog.

290
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,250
The three of you make a happy family.

291
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,450
How could I go out with this on my arm?

292
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:58,930
Simple.

293

Get me a marker.

294
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,210

you’re overjoyed, aren’t you?

298

302
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,210
Don’t mention it, Director.

303
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,530

385
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:21,730
You may leave.

386
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,600
Take care of yourself.

What’s your meeting
with Mr. Shangguan about?

389
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,250
Is there a new case?

390
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,690
He benched me in Dr. Wen’s case.

391
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,770
Why?

392
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,050
I need your help.

393
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,690
He’ll ask you

394
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,480
to help him with that case.

395
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,290
So,

396
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,900
keep me updated

397
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,400
on the status.

398
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,360
Really?

399
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,880
We’ll be handling a case together?

400
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,450
Finally!

401
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:19,730
Xiong Jingjing,

402
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:20,900
you won’t say no to me,

403
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,730
will you?

404
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,210
You’ve asked nicely,

405
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,050
so I’ll see what I can do.

406

Not even a single message.

407
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,300
Hello.

408
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:53,860
Sorry,

409
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,090
I might’ve sent it to you by mistake.

410
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:55,780
OK.

411
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,530
Bye.

412
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,160
Could he do that?

413
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,650
Come this afternoon
to pick up the books.

414
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,640
I’ll be there.

415

Sorry.

417
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,640

00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:45,800

What’s gotten into me?

424
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,490

Yeah.

I do.

441
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,610
Also a doctor.

442
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:27,490
So the whole world knows

443
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,800
except me?

Wen Rang,

445
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,840
you should get treated.

446
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,380

00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,540
from inside out

448
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,970
and you have an anger issue.

449
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,160
Hurry up

450
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,750
and ask Grandpa to prescribe you herbs

451
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,850
to help blow off your steam.

452
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,730
Don’t give me that crap.

453
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:42,580
If you guys already know everything,

454
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,840
why keep me in the dark?

455
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,730
Whose fault is that?

456
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,320
You don’t care about her, do you?

457
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,800
Seeing her find a better man

458
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,210
with good looks,

459
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:54,600
you get jealous?

460
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,490
How is he better?

461
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,210
Isn’t he just a doctor?

462
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,400
And what good looks?

463
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,400
Aren’t you just a bookstore owner,

464
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,450
who, by the way, is still in denial?

465
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:03,970
Listen,

466
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,140
if it were me,

467
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,240
I’d choose him over you, too.

468
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,400

So what’s for lunch?

474
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,050
Why ask?

475
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,530
Will you order takeout?

476
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:16,410
Sure.

477
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,450
What do you want?

478
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,620
Why are you taking away the bricks

479

480
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,010
What’s wrong with them?

481
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,770
I haven’t recovered from the last fight.

482
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,000
Are you trying to start another one?

483
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,880
Are you insane?

484
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,730
You’re absolutely right.

485
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,640
I am insane.

486
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,010
Whatever.

487
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,380
You can’t cancel the lease.

488
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,780
Please reconsider it.

489
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,640
No need.

490
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,080
I’m scared, OK?

491
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,250
I didn’t take the surroundings
into consideration

492
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,620
when renting this store.

493
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,450
I can’t stand staying next to a lunatic.

494
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,690
It’s dangerous.

495
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:58,820
I can explain.

496
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,340
He isn’t always like that.

497
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,860
I’ll talk to him.

498
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,380
Don’t bother.

499
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,370
It’s useless.

500
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:04,010
I relapse into insanity

501
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:04,970
irregularly

502
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:05,540
and unexpectedly.

503
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,930
I can’t control myself.

504
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:08,730
See?

505
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,440
Look at him!

506
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,400
He’s sick!

507
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,360
Wen Rang!

508
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,160
Hey,

509
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,100
you know what,

510
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:15,860
this area

511
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,090
is cursed.

512
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:17,780
It’s bad for business.

513
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,300
No...

514
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,380
My store is a perfect example.

515
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,840
You won’t break even.

516
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:22,100
I...

517
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:22,810
Miss,

518
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:23,380
I’m serious.

519
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,640
I don’t want this place anymore.

520
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,410
Look,

521
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:26,380
I haven’t done anything.

522
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,650
You have nothing to lose.

523
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,730
Just give me the money back.

524
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:29,820
How about this?

525
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,780
Keep the changes to yourself,

526
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,170
OK?

527
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,320
Just let me go.

528
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,650
You can’t do this.

529
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,380
We’ve signed the contract.

530
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,650
You’ve redecorated the place

531
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,100
and removed walls.

532
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,450
I can’t return your money.

533
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,610
I can.

534
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:41,930
How much is it?

535
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:42,880
I’ll pay.

536
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,890
Please excuse me.

537
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:48,410
Sorry.

538
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,050
Hold on.

539
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,050
What did I do to you?

540
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,010
Nothing.

541
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,620
Why did you make me come over and over?

542
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,640
Because I miss you.

543
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,320
That again?

544
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,920
Do you think I’m so stupid

545
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,340
that I’ll fall for your sweet talk,

546
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,650
and my heart will race for you

547
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:16,730
to satisfy your ego?

548
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,160
I mean it.

549
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,880
I heard you’re getting married.

550
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:24,730
So?

551
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,290
Is there a problem?

552
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:31,880
Zhou Chengcheng,

553
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,930
do you think love is a game

554
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,060
that you can play

555
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,410
or quit any time you want?

556
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,620
You start

557
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,010
and end everything as you please.

558
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:42,080
How could you do this?

559
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,080
In your eyes,

560
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,450
I’m nothing

561
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,490
but a joke,

562
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,140
yeah?

563
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,900
What do you think?

564
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,930
You’re marrying

565
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:54,060
a so-called perfect match in haste.

566
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,490
Who else would do that?

567
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:56,210
Excuse me?

568
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,170
What do you mean?

569
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,490
What perfect match?

570
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,450
You posted it on Moments, didn’t you?

571
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,690
I... I photoshopped it.

572
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,360
Yes, I’m ridiculous.

573
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,540
The most ridiculous thing I’ve ever done

574
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,840
is to have fallen in love with you.

575
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,160
I knew you’d never love me back

576
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,880
but I stayed and listened to your crap.

577
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,080
Will you be my girlfriend?

578
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,210
I was a jerk.

579
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,360
I didn’t mean anything I said.

580
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:39,730
Zhou Chengcheng,

581
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:41,930
be my girlfriend.

582
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:24,940
<i>Rang Kai Bookstore</i>

583
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,560
Wen Rang!

584
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:31,440
Wen Rang!

585
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:32,540
Thanks to you,

586
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,670
Tagore’s poems finally speak to me.

587
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,820
“When I stand before thee

588
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,250
at the day’s end,

589
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,400
thou shalt see my scars

590
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,360
and know that I had my wounds
and also my healing”.

591
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,820
Love can be a battle

592
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,640
in which we break each other’s shells.

593
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:57,600
Stray birds can keep flying
without landing.

594
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,220
<i>Selected Poems of Tagore</i>

595
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,050
Wen Rang!

596
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,080
We’re home.

597
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:37,290
One page to go.

598
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:43,810
This package came for you.

599
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,210
How did you get it?

600
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,160
And it’s open.

601
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:49,700
It got my address on it

602
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,080
without a recipient.

603
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:52,610
I assumed it was mine

604
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:53,410
and opened it.

605
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,240
Apparently, it wasn’t.

606
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,330
Zhou Chengcheng’s name
is on the voucher.

607
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,890
So she must’ve bought something for you.

608
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,760
Why was it sent to you?

609
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,600
This might be a mistake.

610
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,040
I don’t think it’s for me.

611
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,930
Maybe she put the address wrong.

612
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,810
I’m in a rush.

613
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:23,890
Gotta go.

614
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:43,850
My phone.

615
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,500
<i>Zhou Chengcheng</i>

616
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,680
Why did you send me a robe?

617
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:56,810
You got it?

618
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:57,780
What do you think?

619
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,160
It’s your size.

620
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:00,680
Do put it on.

621
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,280
It’s got lace!

622
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:05,700
Your old ones

623
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,250
are too safe.

624
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,820
So I chose a lace robe

625
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,960
made of silk.

626
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,780
You’ll look super sexy in it.

627
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,380
Sorry,

628
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,260
“super sexy”

629
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,490
is way beyond my level.

630
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,810
Don’t hold yourself back.

631
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:18,930
Miss Zhou,

632
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,090
Wen Shaoqing is only looking after me.

633
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,450
We aren’t moving in together.

634
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:26,720
What about that knot he made?

635
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:29,300
You could’ve sent it to me.

636
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,850
Why him?

637
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,680
He saw it?

638
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,120
Just as I expected.

639
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,240
That was to give him
something to imagine.

640
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,570
No, thanks.

641
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,240
We don’t need it.

642
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,450
You’ve passed that stage?

643
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:44,260
Zhou Chengcheng,

644
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,560
get your mind out of the gutter!

645
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,560
It’s got more than one belts

646
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,050
to make Surgeon’s Knots.

647
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,610
They’ll keep his skills

648
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:51,660
from getting rusty in suspension,

649
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,200
right?

650
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,370
Zhou Chengcheng,

651
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,340
you’re beaming with joy.

652
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,000
What’s the good news?

653
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,970
The thing is

654
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,280
I have an admirer.

655
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,380
Who is it?

656
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,260
Do I know him?

657
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:03,900
That can wait

658
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,200
until next time.

659
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:07,050
Put on the robe,

660
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,930
Miss Cong.

661
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,130
Bye.

662
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:10,850
Go away.

663
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,690
What’s up?

664
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:16,850
I’ve made night snacks.

665
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,200
Would you like some before bed?

666
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,720
I... I’m not hungry.

667
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,080
I had a big dinner.

668
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,850
These contain vitamins.

669
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,530
Is it the poorly chosen orange
from yesterday?

670
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,560
It’s too sour,

671
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,810
making my teeth sensitive.

672
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:46,760
Taste it.

673
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,240
How come it’s sweet?

674
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,780
Microwaved it

675
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,760
with medium power for a few seconds.

676
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,370
This is for you.

677
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:07,240
Too late.

678
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:08,810
What’s wrong?

679
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:09,560
I didn’t touch it.

680
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,680
Besides,

681
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,180
don’t you know the phrase
“Bitten Peach”?

682
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,530
So you adore me?

683
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,050
I mean you’re a magician

684
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:20,490
who can make

685
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,330
anything taste good.

686
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:28,200
Cong Rong,

687
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,680
I love you

688
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,410
not because of your look.

689
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:47,160
You’ve passed that stage?

690
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,970
I need to send an email.

691
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:52,900
My router is down.

692
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,200
May I use your Wi-Fi?

693
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:06,850
Let me.

694
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,490
What do those numbers mean?

695
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,450
You’re using 10-key?

696
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,450
Cheesy pick-up lines.

697
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,180
<i>Wi-Fi “2664766464926926744952676”</i>

698
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:33,180
<i>Cong Rong, you’ll marry me eventually.</i>

699
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,600
Wen Shaoqing,

700
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:42,560
what’s your Wi-Fi password again?

701
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,280
42633.

702
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,580
<i>Cong Rong, you’ll marry me eventually.</i>

703
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,160
You can stop typing.

704
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,540
It’s “yes”.

705
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,260
<i>Cong Rong, you’ll marry me eventually.
Yes.</i>
