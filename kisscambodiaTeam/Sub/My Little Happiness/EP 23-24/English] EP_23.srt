<i>Episode 23</i>

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,990
Mr. Shangguan.

4
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:18,690
Can you take the case

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,270
about Yun Ji Hospital?

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,960
No, I can’t take that case.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,840
Why?

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,430
Lawyers have their own
strength and weakness,

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,710
and their own majors.

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,430
Intentional injury cases
are not my strong suit,

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,160
let alone it concerns medical disputes.

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,880
I won’t take cases that I’m not sure of.

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,240
You’ve cooperated with Yun Ji for years

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,510
and won all the medical dispute cases

15
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,360
that you took.

16
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,730
Your capability is proved.

17
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,110
Please reconsider it.

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,110
Cong Rong.

19
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,160
You want me to take it
for the case’s sake

20
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:58,720
or for your selfish purpose?

21
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,600
The online loan case
will be opened soon.

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,350
Put your mind to that case.

23
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,230
Don’t let me down.

24
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,350
What have you done exactly?

25
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,640
Even an unemotional man like him got mad

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,880
and raised his voice so loud.

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,390
I just want him to take a case.

28
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,010
Cong Rong.

29
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,100
Come here.

30
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,620
Um.

31
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,780
Come in.

32
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,900
Sorry, Mr. Shangguan.

33
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,850
I was too anxious just now.

34
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,620
I shouldn’t trouble you.

35
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,500
Is Wen Shaoqing your boyfriend?

36
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,100
Um.

37
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:24,820
Yes.

38
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,340
That’s why

39
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,450
you help him with the lawsuit?

40
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,290
I admit that

41
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,380
I have a selfish purpose,

42
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,900
but that’s not all the reason.

43
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,470
I had an internship in the hospital,

44
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,230
and know doctor-patient relationship
is tense.

45
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,030
It’ll incur disputes
if not handled well.

46
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,410
We can understand
patients and their families,

47
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,970
but doctors shall also
be respected by patients.

48
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:47,940
As for this case,

49
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,570
from a fair standpoint,

50
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,060
I don’t think Shaoqing is wrong.

51
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,580
That’s why I’ll help him

52
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,690
and clarify the truth to people.

53
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,570
OK.

54
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,890
Prepare for the trial
of online loan case first.

55
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,060
I’ll take care of this case.

56
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,500
Really?

57
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,860
Thank you, Mr. Shangguan.

58
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,590
For more details,

59
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,740
I need to talk with my client.

60
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,410
Let him come here when he’s free.

61
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,100
OK.

62
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,330
I’ll call him here right now.

63
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,300
By the way,

64
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,140
you must go all out
for the online loan case.

65
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,020
Rest assured.

66
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,060
I’ll be well-prepared.

67
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,380
<i>Civil Case Indictment</i>
It’s my first time to get an indictment.

68
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,900
It’s intriguing.

69
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,860
You brat.

70
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,180
You’re in great trouble,

71
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,450
and still have the mood to joke?

72
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,690
Sit.

73
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,740
Here is the situation.

74
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,090
The patient’s family
sued the hospital and you.

75
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,690
It’s fine for the hospital to go through

76
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,330
medical malpractice identification
by the Medical Association

77
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,970
and cope with relevant issues.

78
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,540
Chen Cu has briefed it to me.

79
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,980
There should be no problem, right?

80
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,010
In the meeting,

81
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,890
we had the same judgement,

82
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,450
but it would be a trouble for you.

83
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,500
I know.

84
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,980
The hospital is under great pressure.

85
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,820
I respect the hospital’s decision.

86
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,500
But I’m itching

87
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:22,940
to come back for work.

88
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,890
I know you wanna be back for surgeries.

89
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,250
The seniors here watched you grow up.

90
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,540
They all care about you,

91
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,980
and don’t hope anything goes wrong
with your career.

92
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,940
How about the hospital hires
a good lawyer for you?

93
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,540
Sir, have you forgotten Cong Rong’s job?

94
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,890
I’ve really forgotten it.

95
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,030
Alright.

96
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:46,740
Director Yan,

97
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,980
see you around.

98
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,570
OK.

99
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,980
Take care these days.

100
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,770
OK.

101
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,030
See you.

102
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,450
OK.

103
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,250
Boss.

104
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,690
Here!

105
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,060
What are you doing?

106
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,530
You should be on duty.

107
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,900
Chen Cu is performing a surgery.

108
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,860
He knew you’d come,

109
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,150
and asked me to bring you

110
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,180
the breakfast he prepared.

111
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,330
Anything else?

112
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,030
Boss,

113
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,250
when will you come back?

114
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,250
What?

115
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,180
You wanna be punished to copy books?

116
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,130
Truth to be told,

117
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,010
not being urged to learn,

118
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,770
I’ve been perturbed all day.

119
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,860
Please come back.

120
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,650
Dr. Wen.

121
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,500
Even if you won’t be a doctor,

122
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,860
you can give us lectures.

123
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,980
What nonsense is that?

124
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,660
It’s his fate to be a doctor.

125
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,060
He will still be back as a doctor.

126
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:50,620
Yes.

127
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,820
Yes.

128
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:52,740
Boss,

129
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,500
we’re waiting for you.

130
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,230
Me too.

131
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,980
We’re all waiting for you.

132
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:56,860
You brat.

133
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,500
Rest assured.

134
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,740
I promise I will.

135
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,980
But before that,

136
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,860
go back now for your work.

137
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,620
Yes, sir!

138
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,670
Go.

139
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:04,980
Go back to work.

140
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,230
Go.

141
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,300
Go.

142
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,250
Go. Go.

143
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,380
Bye-bye, boss.

144
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:09,980
Boss.

145
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,590
I’m waiting for you.

146
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,250
Bye-bye.

147
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,950
<i>Come to the Law Firm this afternoon
to sign the commission contract</i>

148
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,270
<i>Daren Law Firm</i>

149
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,790
Hello.

150
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,860
Do you have an appointment?

151
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,540
Yes.

152
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,500
The lawyer, Miss Cong Rong.

153
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,620
Wait a second, please.

154
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,420
Let me have a check.

155
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,380
No need.

156
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,060
He’s Mr. Shangguan’s client.

157
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,330
Mr. Shangguan is waiting
in the reception room.

158
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,980
Can’t you get another guy?

159
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,910
You are in luck to have him, OK?

160
00:06:58,910 --> 00:06:59,820
You’re picky.

161
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,750
I bear a grudge with him,

162
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,060
remember?

163
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,100
This is the golden lawyer of our firm,

164
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,260
Mr. Shangguan Yi.

165
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,270
I’ve heard a lot about you.

166
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,670
The outstanding young doctor
in Yun Ji Hospital,

167
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,300
Wen Shaoqing.

168
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,690
We’ve met several times.

169
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,180
Cong Rong.

170
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:27,940
Yes?

171
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,900
Although Dr. Wen isn’t a stranger,

172
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,060
you should still serve him water.

173
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:39,790
Sorry.

174
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,850
I’m gonna get it.

175
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,090
She said you could handle the case well.

176
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,660
I count on you then.

177
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,730
I’m flattered.

178
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,420
Litigation comes with risks.

179
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,450
Before it’s ruled by the court,

180
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,020
no one can surely win it.

181
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,850
I usually say these to patients’ family.

182
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,940
Surgery comes with risks.

183
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,060
The success is not guaranteed.

184
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,610
I’m not used to putting myself
in others’ shoes,

185
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,610
but I can understand you.

186
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,260
To be frank,

187
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,240
I didn’t hope you’d come to me.

188
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,330
Nor do I hope to see you
on my operating table.

189
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,820
From now on,

190
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,740
I’m your attorney.

191
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,490
Tell me what happened in detail.

192
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,490
When

193
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,540
and where.

194
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,790
The cause.

195
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,580
The process.

196
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,330
And the result.

197
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,420
The more details, the better.

198
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,690
Here’s the story.

199
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,610
The patient in Bed 3

200
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,610
had been in bad condition.

201
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,370
We provided him ANH by IV,

202
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,370
but his family didn’t agree anyway.

203
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,690
I’ve mostly learned about it.

204
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,180
Let’s call it a day.

205
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,300
Be seated for a while.

206
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:15,990
Excuse me.

207
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,780
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

208
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,570
Mr. Shangguan.

209
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,970
We count on you for our company’s case.

210
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,180
Is it over?

211
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,810
I’ve mostly learned about it.

212
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,180
You may talk with him

213
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,090
about contract details.

214
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:25,940
Um.

215
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,870
This way, please.

216
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,330
OK.

217
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,970
Why was it so soon?

218
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,490
Because I was eager to see you.

219
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,060
Is it fun to tease me?

220
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,180
Nope.

221
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,570
Sign it.

222
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,540
The commission contract.

224
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,660

00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,370
you’ll pay with everything you own.

228
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,210
I don’t need to read it then.

229
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,420
I can’t tell

230
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,690
if you mean to trick me.

231
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,750
So, stop struggling.

232
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,510
Just fill it out

233
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,540

00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,730
Signed it wrong?

237
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,510
It’s fine.

238
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,110

I usually use a blue-black pen
for medical cases.

241
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,970
I’m not used to this color suddenly.

242
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,900
I’m going to fetch another one.

254
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,820

the full part of my life either,

“I shall not change
and go with the flow.”

344
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,540

He said I’ve got much more mature.

383
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,700
Do you have a boyfriend now?

384
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:50,980
Yes.

385
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,500
Be careful this time.

386
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,910
Don’t find a man
like your last boyfriend

387
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,590
who cheated on you

388
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,700
and left you alone crying in the lobby.

389
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:05,890
He won’t.

390
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,570
He is the son of my father’s friend.

391
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,980
I know him well.

392
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,850

00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,780

Zhou Chengcheng,

399
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:00,980
I didn’t finish my words.

00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,590

401
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,300
back then,

402
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,820
I misunderstood Jiang Yao.

403
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,250
Please say sorry to her for me.

404
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,090
Also,

405
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,700
my dad is doing antique business.

406
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,650
He may cooperate with Jiang Yao on it.

407
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,130
Please introduce her to my father.

408
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,410
Pull over.

409
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,740
We... We haven’t arrived.

410
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,170
It’s stuffy in the car.

411
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,370
I’m gonna take a walk alone.

412
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,740
I’ll send her profile to you.

413
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,980
To tell her,
I have to put in words first.

It’s not safe.

441
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,310
Install an anti-theft door then.

My family is still in ICU.

525
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,730
We also need money.

526
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,460

00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,630
These are two things.

00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:35,780
Don’t confuse them.

529
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,700
Many witnesses could prove that

530
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,090
you stirred up the fight.

531
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,090
Your claim is unreasonable.

532
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,980
Mr. Shangguan.

533
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,210
You need evidence to prove it.

534
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,740
The doctors on the scene

535
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,330
all sided with him.

536
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,260
I think they colluded to slander us.

537
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,330
As you see,

538
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,820
we have support from netizens.

539
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,300
He is a doctor.

540
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,850
Whatever the reason is,

541
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,350
doctors shouldn’t fight back.

542
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,020
You did hit him.

543
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:06,130
Any intentional assault is illegal,

544
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,260
regardless of status and occupation.

545
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,300
To affect justice with public opinion

546
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,500
is impossible.

547
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,130
You...

548
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,420
We can

549
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,850
drop the charge.

550
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,420
And we can talk about the compensation.

551
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,490
It’s nothing about the compensation.

552
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,010
The truth is what we want.

553
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,540
Dr. Wen did nothing wrong...!

554
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,090
I’ve learned about your demand.

555
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,090
We’ll respond to the complaint.

556
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,550
I’m sure your unreasonable demands

557
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,820
won’t be backed up by the court.

558
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,220
If nothing else,

559
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,130
I’ll take my leave.

00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,300

562
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,780
They are really hard to deal with.

563
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,770
We may talk at the firm later.

564
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:50,180
OK.

565
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,410
I’ll wait for you at the firm.

566
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,410
Ms. Cong.

567
00:30:58,670 --> 00:30:59,820
Anything else?

568
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,930
Why don’t you reconsider it?

569
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,740
You know that doctor.

570
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,910
You may convince him.

571
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,330
He doesn’t want to lose his job

572
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,300
for some money, does he?

573
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,410
Cong Rong!

574
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,170
Are you alright?

575
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:24,540
I’m fine.

576
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:24,940
My hand got hurt.

577
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,310
What happened?

578
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:25,670
Are you alright?

579
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:26,410
Let me see.

580
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,890
We need to go to the Orthopedics.

581
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,370
A fracture, I guess.

582
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:34,610
Let’s go.

583
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,790
<i>Qin Chu</i>

584
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,380
Hello, Qin Chu.

585
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,130
What’s up?

586
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,500
Cong Rong’s hand fractured.

587
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,820
She looks pale.

588
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,070
We’re now in the Orthopedics.

589
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,260
Come here now.

590
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:09,550
<i>Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital</i>

591
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,020
Have a cast

592
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,300
and you’ll recover soon.

593
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,700
Boss is here.

594
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,780
What happened?

595
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:15,820
Show me your hand.

596
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,850
What brings you here?

597
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,210
It’s fine.

598
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:20,130
I fell when going downstairs

599
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,930
and hit the ground with my hand.

600
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,830
You’re no kid,

601
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,820
but still so worrisome.

602
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,370
For fear that you’d be worried,

603
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,890
she didn’t tell you
she met the patient’s family.

604
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,820
This is the CT.

605
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:41,590
I have things to do.

606
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,410
I’m leaving.

607
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,300
Thanks.

608
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,330
Distal radius fracture.

609
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,140
It’s not very serious,

610
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,780
but you still need a cast.

611
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,370
OK.

612
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,330
I know this, too.

613
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:00,970
Zhong Zhen.

614
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:01,590
Yes?

615
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,450
What are you waiting for?

616
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,260
Go to the doctor for a cast list.

617
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,620
Be careful. Be careful. Be careful.

618
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,450
Blow it.

619
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:15,740
Don’t move.

620
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:17,330
Sit here.

621
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,580
Take a seat.

622
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,370
I’m gonna see how many people are ahead.

623
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:24,970
Don’t touch it.

624
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,300
Rong.

625
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,940
You two lovebirds are so pathetic.

626
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,820
One is suspended.

627
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,740
The other has a fracture.

628
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,150
Are you two being cursed?

629
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:34,780
I...

630
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,140
Boss.

631
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,030
Cong Rong says it hurts badly.

632
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:37,890
Come and have a look.

633
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:41,780
Take it.

634
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,140
How do you feel?

635
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,180
I’m fine.

636
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,010
He is lying.

637
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:46,780
Rong.

638
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,340
How come

639
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,970
you suddenly fell and had a fracture?

640
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,700
My boss is suspended.

641
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,580
So, you got upset

642
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,810
and fell down in a trance?

643
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:56,700
Shut up.

644
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,530
Come with me.

645
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,410
Not to line up?

646
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,260
Slowly.

647
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,330
Take a seat here.

648
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,700
Too many people are ahead.

649
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,410
We won’t wait.

650
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,450
I’ll do it myself.

651
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,140
You?

652
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,660
You are not an orthopedic surgeon.

653
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:30,850
I’ve learned it.

654
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,740
You said a Jack of all trades
is a master of none.

655
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,580
It’s just a cast.

656
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,690
I... I’d rather wait.

657
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,970
Don’t you trust me?

658
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,490
Boss.

659
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:20,890
Haven’t you finished?

660
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:21,780
Zip it.

661
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,950
Dr. Wen is applying a cast!

662
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,180
Come and see!

663
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,140
I come here twice,

664
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,660
and get watched twice.

665
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,370
Last time to pull a tooth.

666
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,330
Now to apply a cast.

667
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,580
I’ll never come again.

668
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,620
Boss.

669
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,370
You applied it well,

670
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,660
but I still have to blame you.

671
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,450
Since my cousin was with you,

672
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,410
she’s got hurt many times.

673
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,050
I feel bad for it. OK?

674
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,430
If I have a girlfriend,

675
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,930
I’ll wrap her in cotton

676
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,820
and take her with me in my pocket.

677
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,100
Do you mean a Barbie doll?

678
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,700
It’s a metaphor.

679
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:08,490
I’ll take good care of her, anyway.

680
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,580
She won’t get any harm.

681
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:11,970
Am I right?

682
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,930
Shut up and no one sees you as a dumb.

683
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,740
Go out, guys.

684
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:18,930
Right.

685
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,140
This is my family affair.

686
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,630
You guys go out.

687
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,340
Outsiders shouldn’t be here.

688
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,300
And you.

689
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,300
Go out.

690
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,410
Is the height OK?

691
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,450
It’s fine.

692
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,330
That was about my work.

693
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,530
It has nothing to do with you.

694
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,930
Don’t blame yourself.

695
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:11,820
He is right.

696
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,450
I didn’t protect you well.

697
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,930
We’ll quit the lawsuit.

698
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,660
No.

699
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,140
You have to pay me for the service.

700
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,620
Cong Rong.

701
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,580
Thanks.

702
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,410
Does it hurt?
