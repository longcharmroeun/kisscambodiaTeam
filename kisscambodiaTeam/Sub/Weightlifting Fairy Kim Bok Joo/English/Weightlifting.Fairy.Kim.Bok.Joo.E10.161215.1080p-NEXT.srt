What is it? What happened?

3
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,450
Where on earth is she?

4
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,450
- Joon Hyung. - Come on out.

5
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,210
What are you doing?

6
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,250
Joon Hyung.

7
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:13,980
How did you come here?

8
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,310
Ah Young told me about this. My friend opened a clinic near here.

9
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,510
She was my patient. I thought I should cheer for her.

10
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,680
Why would you come and cheer for Bok Joo?

11
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,810
Hey. What's wrong with you? Why are you so angry?

12
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,250
The guy she likes...

13
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,480
is you, Jae Yi.

14
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,180
Bok Joo likes you.

15
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,620
That's why she secretly went to your clinic.

16
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,810
She took it hard when you found out she's a weightlifter.

17
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,580
She was worried you might think she's a big liar.

18
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,580
Then you show up here of all places.

19
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,580
She's a girl, too.

20
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,850
Do you think she'd want to show...

21
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,380
the guy she likes her contorted face while lifting weights?

22
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,110
So just go.

23
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,750
Bok Joo's feelings are already hurt.

24
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,780
(Episode 10, A Comma or a Period)

25
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,610
- We did it! - Yes!

26
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,010
Professor Yoon.

27
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,850
Corners of your mouth are turning up.

28
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,750
You told me not to dwell on the result, but you look like Joker now.

29
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,080
Joker or not, I don't care about that right now.

30
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,110
Listen. Our team...

31
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,180
has achieved the best result in 10 years.

32
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,610
Why would I care about that now?

33
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,410
Our strategy worked perfectly.

34
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,780
We won 1 gold, 1 silver, and 2 bronze medals. Gosh.

35
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,510
I'm so happy that I could dance right now. Should I dance?

36
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,750
Please calm down.

37
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,780
Hello? Gosh. You must be so happy, Mr. Kim.

38
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,480
Yes. Oh, really?

39
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,780
Okay. I will do that.

40
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,180
Yes. Thank you.

41
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,180
Stop the music.

42
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,310
- Attention. - Gosh.

43
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,420
First of all, some of you achieved great outcome.

44
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,480
Min Young, Woon Gi, Jung Woo,

45
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,610
and Bok Joo. You did great today. Applaud them.

46
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,980
- Thank you. - Thank you.

47
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,450
- We owe it to you two. - Thank you.

48
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,710
But I think...

49
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,850
you all deserve to stand on the podium.

50
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,880
The ones who cheered for them when they were warming up,

51
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,650
the ones who gave them water when they tensely waited for their turn,

52
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,110
and the ones who applauded them when they made good records.

53
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,780
I'm saying...

54
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,750
it's like those people lifted the barbell with you today.

55
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,080
On that note,

56
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,380
I've got some hot news.

57
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,420
We're having a dinner party at Bok Chicken today!

58
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,350
Let's go and pig out!

59
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,980
- Yes! - Great!

60
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,420
- Pick me, pick me, pick me up - Pick me, pick me, pick me up

61
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,420
- Enjoy. - Enjoy, everyone.

62
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,310
Let me know if you want anything more.

63
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,910
- Awesome. - Thank you.

64
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,950
All right, quiet down.

65
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,310
Today,

66
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,550
each person must eat two whole chickens, okay?

67
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,880
- Okay. - Okay.

68
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,350
Mr. Kim, I'll get going now. I already finished two chickens.

69
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,310
That was impressive, Woon Gi.

70
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,780
You're ahead of the game since you won the silver medal.

71
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,010
- You'd better eat five chickens. - Okay.

72
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,610
Professor Yoon, you deserve to eat the most.

73
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,010
I'm eating a lot.

74
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,650
- Thank you, Mr. Kim. - Thank you.

75
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,480
Thanks to you, we have a great athlete like Bok Joo.

76
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,380
You provide us food when we're hungry.

77
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,950
Thank you very much.

78
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,150
I'm not the one.

79
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,050
You're the one who made her an athlete.

80
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,710
Not at all. You are the one.

81
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,610
You've raised your daughter very well.

82
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,250
When Bok Joo was born,

83
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,610
I said that...

84
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,450
Bok Joo was such an outdated name.

85
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,480
I'd like to take that back.

86
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,110
Bok Joo is such a lucky girl.

87
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,810
I think she's the one who did the most work.

88
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,080
She increased Bok Joo's weight class.

89
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,580
You ate pupa stew with much gusto last time. Here you go.

90
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,610
Oh, thank you.

91
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,210
Last time?

92
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,710
Have you come here to drink without me?

93
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,550
Just once.

94
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,210
- Last time, I made her breakfast... - Woon Gi!

95
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,450
Isn't it perfect timing...

96
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,750
to say the weightlifting team's chant?

97
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,050
- Weightlifting! - Weightlifting!

99

Oh, my goodness.

109
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,210
Why is my face on the screen?

110
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,950
You're impossible.

111
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,110
It's because it's in selfie mode.

112
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,550
My goodness.

113
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,550
She looks beautiful.

114
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,080
She isn't exactly beautiful.

115
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,210
Of course she is.

116
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,520
All of you did a good job yesterday.

117
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,550
We have another good news.

118
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,150
Coach Choi?

119
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,210
Shall I tell them?

120
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,020
Everyone.

121
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,480
As you know, N.S. Ning sponsors some teams at our school.

122
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,650
- Yes. - Yes.

123
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,650
Finally,

124
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:59,110
they agreed to sponsor us from now on.

125
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,380
Will they start to treat us better?

126
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,580
Can we eat as many snacks as possible?

127
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,680
Of course.

128
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,410
We won't be treated like kings,

129
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,020
but we won't have to worry about food anymore.

130
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,410
Good job, everyone.

131
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,310
However, don't relax just because the competition is over.

132
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,750
Until everyone sets a new record,

133
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,650
- keep up the good work! - Let's go!

134
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,680
Go ahead and enjoy your food.

135
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,350
- Go on. - Thank you.

136
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,750
- Enjoy. - Let's go.

137
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,150
Bok Joo.

138
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,180
For you,

139
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,150
N.S. is considering to recruit you to their official team.

140
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,550
Let's have a meeting this weekend.

141
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,810
I think they became your fan.

142
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,180
They want to meet you.

143
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,950
Bok Joo, that's awesome.

144
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,580
- N.S. is awesome. - Awesome.

145
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,180
Girl, it's okay to show that you're happy.

146
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,450
Don't worry about us.

147
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,610
Congratulations.

148
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,210
Don't feel discouraged.

149
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,750
They will recruit a few more other than Bok Joo.

150
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,780
Work hard so you can be one of them.

151
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,610
- I know, I know. - That's good.

152
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,810
I get an opportunity because my friend is an ace.

153
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,950
Thank you, Bok Joo.

154
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,350
Come on. Let's go eat.

155
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,650
Why aren't you eating, Bok Joo?

156
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,910
You've been listless since yesterday.

157
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,310
That's true. Are you sick?

158
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,180
Do you have a fever because of yesterday's competition?

159
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,580
No, I'm fine.

160
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,650
Look who it is.

161
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,210
It's the weightlifter who was on the news last night.

162
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,310
It's the great Bok Joo.

163
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,450
May I take a photo with you?

164
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,810
- How about a photo? - Excuse me.

165
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,880
You aren't allowed to take her photos. Keep moving.

166
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:32,180
She has to finish her meal.

167
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,510
I'm leaving since I have no appetite.

168
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,750
Finish your meal.

169
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,650
Bok Joo.

170
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,550
I'm leaving, too. Take care of my tray.

171
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,510
Hey, wait.

172
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,750
What do I do with...

173
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,710
You almost got into an accident. Stay alert.

174
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,910
I'm sorry.

175
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,050
It's fine.

176
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,310
Don't apologize to me.

177
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,280
You should apologize to your body.

178
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,710
You won the national competition.

179
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,310
Don't you know your body is precious?

180
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,680
Okay, I have to go.

181
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,080
Hey.

182
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,250
You didn't even finish your meal.

183
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,850
How will you lift weights later?

184
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,150
I don't know what you like. You can choose.

185
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,780
Oh, thank you.

186
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,210
You were really incredible.

187
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,510
When people called you a rising star,

188
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,080
I didn't believe them.

189
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,750
I heard you set a new record this time.

190
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,780
After I saw you on the news, I bragged to everyone about you.

191
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,580
I see.

192
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,980
Go on and eat.

193
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,080
I spent all my allowance on it.

194
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,810
Okay, I'll eat.

195
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,250
Why are you so down?

196
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,710
Shouldn't you be ecstatic after setting a new record?

197
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,780
I've never placed first, so I feel inferior now.

198
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,650
Here, eat it. It's your favorite.

199
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,480
Bok Joo, look at me.

200
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,450
What are you doing? That's so childish.

201
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,380
Was that a sneer? Fine.

202
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,550
I'll show you something really funny.

203
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,250
Copying Bok Joo, number one.

204
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,350
"You know, I even hit men."

205
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,010
Number two, this is you pretending to be cute.

206
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,550
Take a look.

207
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,810
Number three.

208
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,450
Your running.

209
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,350
Gosh, I wasn't going to go this far.

210
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,880
"Chicken delivery."

211
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,550
"Who ordered chicken?"

212
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,950
"Chicken delivery."

213
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,310
"Chicken delivery."

214
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,080
- "Here's your chicken delivery." - Joon Hyung.

215
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,410
Don't you have anything to do today?

216
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,650
Gosh, it's very cold.

217
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,510
Chubs, can you give me your jacket?

218
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,480
Gosh, it's fine. I was just kidding.

219
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,510
Cheer up already.

220
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,180
People will probably assume that you got disqualified,

221
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,080
and that is why you are so down.

222
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,280
Cheer up, okay?

223
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:37,010
Hey. I'm going to bug you, then.

224
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,080
Do you want to punch me?

225
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,310
I'm tired and sleepy. I'm going to go take a nap.

226
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,880
I saw the banner. So you won the first place.

227
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:02,910
Yes.

228
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,010
Congratulations.

229
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,410
(Dr. Jeong)

230
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,010
(Dr. Jeong)

231
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,510
Hello?

232
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,710
Bok Joo, do you have a moment to talk?

233
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,680
Yes, of course. Go ahead.

234
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,180
Are you at school now? Are you in the middle of your training?

235
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,610
No, I'm taking a break.

236
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,550
What is it about?

237
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,510
Then...

238
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,250
can we meet briefly?

239
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,450
Now?

240
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,880
Hello.

241
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,410
- Hello. - Have a seat.

242
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,220
Do you want to eat something? I can order.

243
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,250
Well, why did you want to see me?

244
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,250
First, I wanted to congratulate you on winning the first place.

245
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,280
I see. Thank you.

246
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,780
Joon Hyung lectured me harshly yesterday.

247
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,280
I was in the area,

248
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,510
so I just stopped by to cheer for you at the match.

249
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,080
I probably shouldn't have done it.

250
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,650
I'm sorry, Bok Joo.

251
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,220
I hope...

252
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,450
that I didn't hurt your feelings in any way.

253
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,550
Come to think of it, I think I made...

254
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,450
a few other mistakes even though it wasn't my intention.

255
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,350
I should have been more thoughtful. I'm sorry.

256
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,220
That's not true at all.

257
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,050
You didn't do anything wrong.

258
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:49,720
It's all my fault.

259
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,280
I fell for you alone and did all sorts of silly things.

260
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,350
I mean, I even lied to you.

261
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,910
- It's really all my fault. - No.

262
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,510
I did it out of goodwill, but it could've been misleading.

263
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,010
I'm older than you, so I should've been more thoughtful.

264
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,850
I'm really sorry.

265
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,050
No, it's fine. Please don't apologize.

266
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,410
Every time I see you, I feel energized...

267
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,450
and happy.

268
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,880
That's probably why I made the mistake.

269
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,310
Well...

270
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,220
I should've been more careful.

271
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,280
Please don't say that, Doctor.

272
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,350
What's wrong with being kind to people?

273
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:32,750
This world is full of mean people who treat others badly.

274
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,380
I'm impulsive and capricious.

275
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,380
I get love-struck easily...

276
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,180
and fall for someone else quickly.

277
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,480
The same goes for celebrities.

278
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,850
I'd be in love with Song Joong Ki today and Kim Soo Hyun the next day.

279
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:46,910
It changes on a daily basis.

280
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:53,510
Joon Hyung and I only met again recently,

281
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,110
so he probably doesn't know this about me.

282
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,980
When I train,

283
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,550
I get bored and look for ways to distract myself.

284
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,220
But as you saw yesterday,

285
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,650
I ended up winning the first place,

286
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,080
so I'll really have to focus on training from now on.

287
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,380
I see.

288
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,680
Well, I actually have to go meet someone now.

289
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,550
So many people want to see me today.

290
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,980
- It's like I've become a celebrity. - Oh, okay.

291
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,150
- Let's get going, then. - Okay.

292
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,080
Gosh, this must be expensive.

293
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,510
Which way are you going?

294
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,080
I'm going this way. What about you, Doctor?

295
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,350
Really? I'm going that way, too. I'll give you a ride.

296
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,380
Oh, I was confused. I'm actually going the other way.

297
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,650
I have to go home first.

298
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,650
Then please drive carefully.

299
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,780
You know that you really don't have to worry about it, right?

300
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,480
All right. Bye.

301
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:03,810
Bye.

302
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,720
Hey, Joon Hyung.

303
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,510
Spare me a second.

304
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,380
Gosh, that was scary.

305
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,880
It looks like she's really angry.

306
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,880
Hey, what's going on? You're scaring me.

307
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,750
What? What is this about?

308
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,150
Why did you do that? Why did you tell him?

309
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,450
- What? - Why did you tell Dr. Jeong...

310
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,010
that I have a crush on him? Who do you think you are?

311
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,580
I just saw him.

312
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,080
He said he feels bad because he thinks he made a mistake.

313
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,480
He kept apologizing to me.

314
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,810
Do you know how horrible I felt...

315
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,910
as I was watching him doing that?

316
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:21,210
I thought, "When I like someone, he has to apologize to me like this."

317
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,050
"I put him in a bind because he can't reciprocate my feelings."

318
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:27,250
- Hey, that's a bit of a stretch. - You shouldn't have done anything.

319
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,850
Why did you have to make me feel that pathetic?

320
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,980
Who are you to tell him how I feel about him?

321
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,310
Hey, that wasn't my intention. I was just...

322
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,710
Fine. I went to the waiting room yesterday.

323
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,380
I saw you crying and felt bad.

324
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,510
But Jae Yi showed up cluelessly with flowers,

325
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,750
so I dragged him outside and lost my temper...

326
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,880
Why would you lose your temper? Are you the one who has a crush on him?

327
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,380
You shouldn't have done anything.

328
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,010
That's much better than him feeling all awkward around me.

329
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,250
Why do you always do whatever you want?

330
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,750
Do you think this is funny?

331
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,480
Are you enjoying watching me making a fool of myself because of him?

332
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,750
Hey.

333
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,950
Do you think I'm a joke?

334
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,750
Do you think I covered up your lies, tried to make you feel better,

335
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,150
and told Jae Yi because I'm bored out of my mind?

336
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,610
I don't know. I can't read your mind.

337
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,680
Fine. Go ahead and think that's how I am.

338
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,550
But what's wrong with you?

339
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,610
Why do you walk around like a loser after winning the first place?

340
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:26,080
Are you that embarrassed about him seeing you at the match?

341
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,710
You've spent all this time on weightlifting, and you're ashamed?

342
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,380
This is a different issue!

343
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,310
You are ashamed of it.

344
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,580
As a fellow athlete,

345
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,650
I thought that you were very cool, but I'm disappointed now.

346
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,680
Who will love you when you're that ashamed of yourself?

347
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,280
You're back.

348
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:59,250
What's the matter with your friend? She seemed very upset.

349
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,010
- We have no more patients, right? - Yes.

350
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,950
- Let's call it a day. - Okay.

351
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,010
Doctor, she wants to go out for drinks.

352
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,110
Take us out for beer. We haven't gone out for drinks in a while.

353
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,080
Sure, let's go grab a drink.

354
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,850
- Hi, Joon Hyung. - Hey, Joon Hyung.

355
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,850
- Are you done for the day? - Yes. We're going to grab a beer.

356
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:27,310
- Do you want to come? - I'm sorry,

357
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,480
but I'll need to steal Jae Yi from you guys today.

358
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,450
Okay. We can go out for drinks another time.

359
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,180
Go get changed. I'll wait outside.

360
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,310
All right.

361
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,410
It's cold. Why didn't you wait inside?

362
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,610
- I heard you saw Bok Joo today. - Yes.

363
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,450
I thought that I might have been overly nice to her...

364
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,050
and felt that I shouldn't have gone to the match.

365
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,650
- I had to do something. - So?

366
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,780
- Was it for you to feel better? - What?

367
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,410
That's basically what you just said.

368
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,780
Didn't you apologize to her to unburden yourself and feel better?

369
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:06,150
No, that's not it. I'm older than you guys, you know.

370
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,380
It wasn't intentional, but I'm still at fault.

371
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,680
I thought I should let her know that I'm sorry.

372
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,780
Why are you asking, though?

373
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,550
- Did I make a mistake again? - Yes.

374
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,580
You made a mistake again.

375
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,550
How do you think she felt to see you all flustered because of her?

376
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,580
Do you think she felt better to see you being sorry?

377
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,280
Why can't you see that...

378
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,810
your consideration for others can hurt their feelings?

379
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:33,810
You've always been like this.

380
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,780
Ever since I moved into your house,

381
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,680
you've been excessively considerate of me.

382
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,280
Even when I broke your things,

383
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,180
even when I drove your car without telling you and made a scratch,

384
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,980
you didn't even get angry at me.

385
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,110
My friends would say I have such a great brother.

386
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,480
But...

387
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,880
it somehow made me sad.

388
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,910
"I see."

389
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:59,210
"It's because I'm not his real brother."

390
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,280
"I'm just..."

391
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,280
"a stranger being protected by this family."

392
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,680
- Joon Hyung. - I know.

393
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,550
That's not how you meant it.

394
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,810
It must've been hard for you...

395
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,380
to be understanding and considerate.

396
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,280
But I hoped you would...

397
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,980
get angry at me,

398
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,480
and sometimes beat me up like other brothers.

399
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,980
That's what I hoped for.

400
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,180
I'm going to go now.

401
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,380
What's going on with all of you?

402
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,850
Hey. Did you eat something together yesterday?

403
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,450
Why are you all slacking off?

404
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,650
I'm sorry.

405
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,880
Stay and work out until you lose all the weight you gained.

406
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,210
Next.

407
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,910
You weigh 0.3kg less than yesterday.

408
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:09,180
If you keep this up, you'll be back to your old weight very soon.

409
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,080
Lose all the weight before the competition.

410
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,180
The selection match is close. You know that, right?

411
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,810
Yes, Coach.

412
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,680
Next.

413
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,650
Take this.

414
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:24,910
What?

415
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,550
Thank you.

416
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,550
Are you sure you can eat all of it?

417
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,280
Yes. I'll eat it...

418
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,750
and run 10 laps around the track.

419
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,380
I'll have a three-hour sauna, too.

420
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,110
Eat it slowly, then.

421
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,780
- Chew it well. - Okay.

422
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,380
Excuse me.

423
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,010
Are you okay?

424
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,350
Do you have indigestion?

425
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,110
I'll go and buy some medicine.

426
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,210
Aren't you annoyed?

427
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,380
I keep changing my mind on a whim.

428
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,180
We ordered a lot of food because I insisted.

429
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,180
Why do you put up with it?

430
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,480
It's because I like you.

431
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,980
I have liked you...

432
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:31,880
since we were freshmen.

433
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,450
Wait here. I'll get you some medicine.

434
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,180
(Couple Pharmacy)

435
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,910
What are you doing in there?

436
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,850
Are you meditating?

437
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,110
No. I was about to go in.

438
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,910
Please go ahead.

439
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,380
Bok Joo.

440
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,080
It's late. Why are you still asleep?

441
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,180
Get up.

442
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,550
Bok Joo. Let's go to the cafeteria.

443
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,280
I'll buy you sausages.

444
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,880
Forget it. I don't want them.

445
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,850
Don't be absurd.

446
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,080
You skipped breakfast. How can you not want the sausages?

447
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,880
Get up, Bok Joo.

448
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,580
Just leave me alone. I want to sleep.

449
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,180
What are you, Sleeping Beauty?

450
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,710
Why do you keep sleeping?

451
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,180
Hey. Let's just let her sleep.

452
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,280
I guess she's tired from the competition.

453
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,180
She's not the only one who had the competition.

454
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,980
Why would she be so tired?

455
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:08,910
Bok Joo.

456
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,710
When you wake up, you'd better be...

457
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,350
as cheerful as usual. Okay?

458
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,710
My gosh.

459
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,380
You're so boring.

460
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:16,980
Goodness.

461
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,080
No matter how hard I try, I just can't understand her.

462
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,180
The competition is over. She should feel relieved.

463
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,180
Why is she having an aftereffect?

464
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,780
She even won first place.

465
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,010
Tell me about it.

466
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,680
But she worked so hard to raise her weight class.

467
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,580
Maybe she feels a little empty inside.

468
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,610
I don't know.

469
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,580
I've never won first place.

470
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,580
- Hello. - It's Tae Kwon.

471
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,910
Don't call him. He's too loud.

472
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,280
What? I think he's nice.

473
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,280
The more I see him, the more I think he's cute.

474
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,180
If I don't have a boyfriend by the end of this year,

475
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,680
I'll seduce him...

476
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,650
and make him my man.

477
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,350
That's what she did.

478
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:06,380
- Really? - Really?

479
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,580
Did Bok Joo really barge into your gym...

480
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,980
- and call Joon Hyung out? - Yes.

481
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,480
I guess you didn't know.

482
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,910
Gosh, she seemed very upset.

483
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,850
Since then, Joon Hyung has been grumpy, too.

484
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:21,210
It looks like something happened between those two.

485
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,380
What could that be?

486
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,210
Isn't it obvious?

487
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,350
I knew this would happen eventually.

488
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,380
Whether it's a guy or a girl,

489
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,210
if you're too close with someone,

490
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,480
you cross the line in the end.

491
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,450
Joon Hyung must have teased her too much...

492
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,080
calling her names like "Chubs".

493
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,080
I told him not to do that so many times,

494
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,580
but it looks like he had a big fight with Bok Joo.

495
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,380
You startled me when you said they crossed the line.

496
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,710
Gosh, I thought you meant something else.

497
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,180
My goodness.

498
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,610
There isn't even the slightest chance of that happening.

499
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,080
Don't you worry.

500
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,680
Joon Hyung is immature in a way,

501
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,380
so he likes pretty girls.

502
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,710
What about you, Tae Kwon?

503
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,210
What kind of girls do you like?

504
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,650
I guess I like...

505
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,180
pretty girls.

506
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,880
Pretty girls?

507
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,610
Oh, look.

508
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,280
- Hello, Professor Yoon. - Hello, Professor Yoon.

509
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,350
Maybe he didn't see us.

510
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,080
He seems to be out of his senses a little.

511
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,280
He's in such a hurry.

512
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,480
What are you talking about?

513
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:24,850
Don't be ridiculous.

514
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,110
Joo Yeon says...

515
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:30,280
Coach Choi called and begged her...

516
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,580
to pay her the operating expenses in advance.

517
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,680
Is that true?

518
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,080
Yes. She did.

519
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,580
Coach Choi. I'm glad you're here.

520
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,850
Come here. It's good that you're here.

521
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,380
You should talk to them.

522
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:56,650
They keep talking nonsense about how you used...

523
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:58,550
- the operating expenses. - It's true.

524
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:00,680
I did it.

525
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,010
- What? - I used it for a personal matter.

526
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,180
I'm sorry.

527
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,710
What's the personal matter?

528
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,650
What was so urgent that you had to use...

529
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,350
the operating expenses?

530
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:21,810
I'm sorry.

531
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,580
Coach Choi.

532
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:31,210
- You should start pushing. - Should I keep going?

533
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,080
Hey. You should lower it more.

534
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,180
Gosh, Woon Gi.

535
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,350
How long are we going to do the stretches?

536
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,910
Training should've started 10 minutes ago.

537
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:49,480
Why aren't Professor Yoon and Coach Choi here?

538
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,550
Did they tell you anything, Woon Gi?

539
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:52,910
No.

540
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,810
- I'll try calling them. - Okay.

541
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:56,910
Hello.

542
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,780
- Hello. - Hello.

543
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,180
Woon Gi. You should take charge of today's training.

544
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,480
Just like yesterday,

545
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,780
have them repeat each set four times, okay?

546
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,980
Gosh. Professor Yoon doesn't look so good.

547
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,180
- What's wrong with him? - I know, right?

548
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,180
He doesn't seem well at all.

549
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,120
- Where's Coach Choi? - That's right.

550
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,750
Professor Yoon looked very pale.

551
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,950
- He ran to the head office. - The head office?

552
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,480
- Why would he? - He went to the head office?

553
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,510
- What's going on? - Why?

554
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,850
He looked like he was in shock.

555
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,980
- There's something going on. - He ran.

556
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,850
- Why would he go there? - Quiet down. What are you doing?

557
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,280
You heard Professor Yoon, right?

558
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:38,080
Repeat the set of four you did yesterday. Go.

559
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,410
- Okay. - Okay.

560
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,650
- Hurry up and get started. - Okay.

561
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,180
Why would he go there?

562
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:45,750
Sir.

563
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:48,650
I'm sure it was necessary for a reason.

564
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,280
Please take care of the matter.

565
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:55,480
She wouldn't use the funds for personal reasons.

566
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,120
It's 3,000 dollars.

567
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,550
It doesn't make sense.

568
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,550
Coach Choi.

569
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,850
Why aren't you in training?

570
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,180
Where did you find the money for my settlement?

571
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,280
You don't need to know.

572
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,210
I heard there's a problem with the operating funds.

573
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,050
I overheard Professor Yoon's phone conversation.

574
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,150
Did it come from the operating funds?

575
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,580
Did you use the operating funds because of me?

576
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,580
- Woon Gi. - Coach Choi.

577
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:36,050
If I had known,

578
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:38,550
I wouldn't have accepted the money even if I'm sent to prison.

579
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,580
- I'll tell the head office. - Stop right there.

580
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,580
Even if you go now, nothing will change.

581
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,410
It's true that I used the school funds.

582
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:50,980
It's my fault.

583
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:54,450
- You should keep quiet. - How can I keep quiet?

584
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,120
All of this happened because of me.

585
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,680
I made the decision, so keep quiet.

586
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,910
If you still tell them after having this conversation,

587
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:03,910
I won't see you anymore.

588
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:29,880
Why can't you see that...

589
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,180
your consideration for others...

590
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,850
can hurt their feelings?

591
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,780
(Jae Yi)

592
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:58,950
Hello, Mom?

593
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,850
Be careful of the top.

594
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:03,510
- Hello. - Hello, Joon Hyung.

595
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:06,210
Hey, what are you doing? Come and help us.

596
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,680
Why are you doing a big cleanup?

597
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,510
Your mom has been wanting to do it.

598
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,450
She suggested we do it before it gets colder.

599
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,350
Honey, you should stop now.

600
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:18,010
Let the boys do it. Go and massage your back.

601
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:20,050
- Isn't your back hurting? - Shall I?

602
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:24,280
I'll let you take over, guys. Thank you.

603
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,510
We'll organize the medicine.

604
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,780
- Thank you. - See you later.

605
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,850
- Where should we put it? - Fix the bottom first.

606
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,850
I didn't train my body for manual labor.

607
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,210
Good work.

608
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,680
It wasn't a lot of work anyway.

609
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,950
Since you worked hard to train your body,

610
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:56,380
how about a round of catch ball?

611
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,410
The glove is too small.

612
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,050
It's from a long time ago.

613
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:39,380
Stop making excuses and just throw the ball.

614
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,780
Here I go.

615
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,080
Jae Yi!

616
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,380
- Are you okay? - What are you doing?

617
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,750
You almost got me hurt.

618
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,380
Is that the best you can do when you're an athlete?

619
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,580
Did you throw it like that because you're upset?

620
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,680
How dare you!

621
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:10,780
How was that?

622
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,450
Did I seem more like an older brother?

623
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,850
Come on.

624
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,120
You startled me.

625
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,780
Ouch.

626
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,880
Seriously,

627
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:32,580
I had no idea that treating you well would create...

628
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,780
more distance between us.

629
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,450
Do I have a disorder?

630
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,280
No way.

631
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,910
It could be that I was being sensitive.

632
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,410
I'm sorry.

633
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:48,010
Don't apologize. I'm the guilty one here.

634
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,150
I should apologize to you.

635
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:54,010
I complained even though you were treating me well.

636
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,350
You were quite scary when you got angry.

637
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,680
I thought you'd punch me.

638
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:03,750
I may seem sweet to you,

639
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,410
but I can be quite tough.

640
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:06,950
I'm not sure about that.

641
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,780
Usually, you don't care about other people's business.

642
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,050
For you to be that upset...

643
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:16,150
means Bok Joo is quite special to you.

644
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:22,050
She isn't special to me.

645
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:27,380
I only pity her because she has a crush on someone at her age.

646
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,780
Fine, I won't care about her from now on.

647
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,550
That's what she asked for as well.

648
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,580
Bok Joo, I won't care about you anymore.

649
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:52,880
That's it.

650
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,050
No more!

651
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:03,450
Your ankle looks terrible.

652
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:04,580
Look at the colors.

653
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,280
It's purple and green.

654
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,380
Are you going to make it more colorful?

655
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,450
You look more relaxed today.

656
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,250
Is there any change to your love life?

657
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,050
- Can you see right through me? - What?

658
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:21,950
Am I right? Is there someone new?

659
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:25,210
I was tired of being obsessive.

660
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:30,120
I wanted to be with someone who likes me.

661
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,850
I fully support that.

662
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,880
It's good to love someone, but you need to be loved...

663
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,980
to boost your self-esteem.

664
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:39,510
Wait.

665
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,310
I can't move well.

666
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,410
Wait a minute.

667
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,510
Didn't you say you're good at skating?

668
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:55,150
Maybe it's because I haven't skated in a long time.

669
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:58,550
Wait, I need to take a break.

670
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,650
Be careful.

671
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:07,380
Undo these first.

672
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:11,680
Like this.

673
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,510
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

674
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,250
It's okay.

675
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:38,010
I know.

676
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:40,410
I know that I'm not the one.

677
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,380
Listen, Si Ho.

678
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:45,010
You can use me as much as you want.

679
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,380
However, stop torturing yourself.

680
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,910
I'll be outside.

681
00:43:58,750 --> 00:43:59,780
What's going on with you?

682
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,680
You waited in front of my house to have a drink with me.

683
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:07,280
You aren't diagnosed with some incurable disease, right?

684
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,310
You have such a wild imagination.

685
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:11,680
It doesn't matter what the reason is.

686
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:15,650
You'll see my drinking habits from our intern days.

687
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,910
- Brace yourself. - Ah Young.

688
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:20,110
Do you think...

689
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,480
there's a problem with my personality?

690
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:24,480
What are you talking about?

691
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,880
Someone told me that...

692
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:29,450
my consideration for others...

693
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:31,280
may hurt their feelings.

694
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,580
My care for someone...

695
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,750
only created more distance.

696
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,580
I don't know who said it, but he's right.

697
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:41,450
Really?

698
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,650
To be honest,

699
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:46,580
you're friendly and caring.

700
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,050
However, sometimes it feels like you're being distant.

701
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,110
It makes me wonder if we're close or not, and I feel disappointed.

702
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:56,750
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

703
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,010
I had no idea.

704
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:00,580
I thought you knew.

705
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:03,410
I supposed it's possible that you didn't know.

706
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,550
- When were you disappointed? - I won't tell you.

707
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,250
- I won't make any comments. - You might as well tell me.

708
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,010
I'm willing to change.

709
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,250
Just a second.

710
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:20,280
Hey, Sang Yun.

711
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:23,310
Really? Okay, I'll see.

712
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:24,880
All right.

713
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:29,450
Sang Yun and Dong Hoon are meeting up with Sang Gu.

714
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:32,380
I heard that he's in Korea now.

715
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,010
I guess he's here for quite a while.

716
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,050
I wonder if Hwan Hee came with him.

717
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:43,710
What do you say? Do you want to go see them with me?

718
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:50,450
Did you go out yesterday?

719
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:51,610
No, I didn't.

720
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:53,250
Then why do you keep chuckling?

721
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,150
I don't know. I'm just excited.

722
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:56,780
- You definitely went out. - No.

723
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:58,850
Hey, it's the weightlifting trio.

724
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:00,210
Hey, girls!

725
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:02,050
Don't.

726
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:04,450
Have you still not made up with your friend?

727
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:06,450
Gosh, just beg her to forgive you.

728
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,110
Shut it. I have nothing to do with that girl anymore.

729
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:12,780
What's wrong with him? Hey, Joon Hyung. Hey...

730
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,280
What is the matter with him?

731
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:18,510
What are you talking about? Coach Choi got fired?

732
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,080
My friend who works at the registrar's office...

733
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:23,410
told me that she got our team's operating funds paid up front...

734
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:26,050
and spent it personally. That's why she got let go.

735
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,750
That is crazy. I cannot believe it.

736
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:30,380
How could Coach Choi do such a thing?

737
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,850
- Is it really true? - I think so.

738
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:34,950
That must be why Professor Yoon was downcast yesterday.

739
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:39,010
That's impossible. We all know that she'd never do such a thing.

740
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:41,850
- I clearly heard it yesterday. - That is really crazy.

741
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:43,850
- No way. - I couldn't believe it, either.

742
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:45,380
- Gosh. - That can't be.

743
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,480
- I can't believe it. - Hello.

744
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,280
Why are you all gathered here?

745
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:54,650
- Woon Gi. - Yes.

746
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:56,510
There won't be any specific training today.

747
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:59,010
Take everyone to the weight room for reinforce training.

748
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,880
I'll leave them with you today.

749
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:18,680
Coach. It's not true, right? It must be just a false rumor.

750
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:20,680
I'm sorry.

751
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,110
Hold on. The fact that she apologized...

752
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,950
means that she's admitting it.

753
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,080
That's just wrong.

754
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,880
- I'm sure she didn't do it. - Let's trust her.

755
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,350
- I'm not sure. - Hey.

756
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:40,050
- How did this happen? - She'd never do such a thing.

757
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:45,380
I really wanted to persuade them not to fire you.

758
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,050
I'm sorry.

759
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,510
It's okay.

760
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:50,250
It's all my fault.

761
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,510
Let me ask you for one last time.

762
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:56,380
Where did you spend the money?

763
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:01,180
I need to know so that I can ask them...

764
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:02,650
to consider your situation.

765
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:04,680
It's all my fault no matter what.

766
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:06,680
You don't need to try to help me.

767
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,350
It was because of me.

768
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:16,780
Coach spent the money to help me...

769
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:19,010
pay the settlement money.

770
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,480
Woon Gi.

771
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:26,850
We're closed now...

772
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:28,550
Hello, Professor Yoon.

773
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:30,680
- Chang Geol! - What is it?

774
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,710
Oh, Professor Yoon. What brings you here at this hour?

775
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,510
Did something happen?

776
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:37,950
It looks like Coach Choi...

777
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:39,750
will get fired.

778
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:43,750
She was waiting on some money anyway,

779
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:46,210
so she just went ahead and spent it to help him out.

780
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,250
But it got out of hand.

781
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:51,050
In order for her situation to be considered,

782
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,110
I need to tell the school the truth.

783
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:56,450
But if I do that, he will face a disciplinary action.

784
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:58,550
I feel too bad for Coach Choi...

785
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,210
to turn a blind eye to what happened.

786
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:03,780
But she's telling me not to bother.

787
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:08,610
She kept the truth from me because she didn't want to worry me.

788
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:12,710
Gosh, that woman...

789
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,550
She's too cool for her own good.

790
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,650
- Coach. - Coach.

791
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,910
Hey, guys.

792
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:49,380
Coach.

793
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,550
Are you really leaving us?

794
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:52,780
My gosh.

795
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:56,850
I'm really sorry, guys.

796
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:01,150
My goodness.

797
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,110
Gosh.

798
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:09,480
Oh, boy. You guys.

799
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:12,150
Keep training hard,

800
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,250
and you better not use this as an excuse to slack off.

801
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,610
Bye, guys.

802
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,710
- Coach. - Don't walk me out. I'm fine alone.

803
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:24,010
Get back to your training, okay?

804
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:25,710
Where did all of your discipline go?

805
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:27,450
Go, weightlifting team!

806
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:37,550
(Weightlifting Department)

807
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:39,280
Coach!

808
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,050
Bok Joo, I told you to stay and train. Why did you follow me?

809
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:46,080
I know that you didn't do it.

810
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:47,950
You'd never do something like that.

811
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:49,580
There must be some sort of a misunderstanding.

812
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:51,110
It's not true, right?

813
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:53,380
I'm really sorry.

814
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:57,850
Then who's going to train me from now on?

815
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,250
You're in charge of my training.

816
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,550
I did all that work to go up a weight class.

817
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,410
Whom am I supposed to lean on from now on?

818
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,410
You can't leave like this!

819
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:09,010
You said we're in this together.

820
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:12,110
Why are you leaving alone like this?

821
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:18,180
- Go back inside. - No, Coach...

822
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:19,980
Coach!

823
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:26,780
Coach!

824
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:34,010
Coach...

825
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:43,780
Oh, boy. Hi.

826
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,510
Here. Get on.

827
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:48,580
It's okay. I'm just going to take a taxi.

828
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:51,780
Gosh. Just listen to me, will you?

829
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,510
Can you try to be a little nicer?

830
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:56,510
What do you say?

831
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,750
Shall we enjoy a speedy ride?

832
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:19,050
This isn't what I expected.

833
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,680
This is not the picture I had in my mind.

834
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,380
Don't go too fast. Drive slowly, please.

835
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:52,310
Hey, Woon Gi.

836
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:54,350
- What's going on? - Woon Gi.

837
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,910
- Woon Gi, what's wrong? - Woon Gi.

838
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,310
Hey!

839
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:59,210
Let's go.

840
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:00,750
Let's go, everyone.

841
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:03,580
Hey, Woon Gi!

842
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:07,980
(Choi Seong Eun)

843
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:11,380
Coach...

844
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:15,780
Coach...

845
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:28,750
Coach...

846
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:48,980
Hey.

847
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:53,750
You know...

848
00:53:54,410 --> 00:53:56,780
that we have a meeting with your sponsor later today, right?

849
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:00,880
Let's...

850
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:03,410
head out together in a bit.

851
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:05,980
Okay.

852
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:10,180
Gosh, why do we have to gather on the weekend?

853
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:11,410
My shift is starting in a bit, too.

854
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,410
Hey, are you sure that Coach is mad because of Ki Seok?

855
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:15,610
Yes!

856
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:18,080
Freshmen had a training with Coach yesterday,

857
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,550
but that punk didn't show up.

858
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:23,480
- That's why he called everyone. - My gosh.

859
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:27,380
- Look. Have you seen Bok Joo? - Bok Joo?

860
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:29,610
We haven't seen her. Why?

861
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:33,080
We've got a meeting with our sponsors, but she disappeared.

862
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:35,480
She disappeared? Did something happen?

863
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,310
Our coach got fired today.

864
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:39,380
Bok Joo was attached to her, so she must be upset.

865
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,850
But still, she wouldn't suddenly disappear like this.

866
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:44,580
I told you she's been acting weird. She just kept on sleeping.

867
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:47,380
Let's check the gym again. She might have come back.

868
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,410
We'll get going, then.

869
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,610
Gosh. What's happening?

870
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:55,850
Bok Joo causes all kinds of trouble.

871
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:05,880
We're late. Hurry up.

872
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:13,480
Where are you going? We're late!

873
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:33,380
This phone is turned off.

874
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:35,310
You'll be directed to...

875
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:42,280
- Jae Yi! - What is it?

876
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,110
Did Bok Joo come here?

877
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:45,850
Bok Joo? No, she didn't.

878
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:48,550
Where did she go, then?

879
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,510
Why? Did something happen to her?

880
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,310
It's nothing.

881
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:56,710
Okay. I should go now. See you later.

882
00:56:58,750 --> 00:56:59,750
Hey.

883
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:04,210
My goodness.

884
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:08,350
Excuse me. What are you doing here?

885
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:11,780
Why are you lying on here? It's dark already.

886
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:14,850
You'll freeze to death. Get up and go.

887
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:17,110
I'm sorry.

888
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:44,180
Hey. What's the matter with you? Where on earth have you been?

889
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:47,280
Everyone was looking all over for you.

890
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,580
Why did you turn off your phone? Are you a teenager?

891
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:52,250
Did you go in hiding to make people worry?

892
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,610
How can you be so immature?

893
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:59,310
Why do you keep making me feel uneasy?

894
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:02,450
Why do you keep making me worry...

895
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:06,110
if you're okay?

896
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:10,210
Joon Hyung.

897
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,150
I feel strange.

898
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:16,880
I think I'm sick.

899
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:20,150
I don't want to do anything.

900
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:22,580
I don't want to lift weights.

901
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:24,350
Strangely, I feel so sleepy.

902
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:26,610
I feel listless.

903
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:31,380
Bok Joo.

904
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:34,310
I think a part of me is broken.

905
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:37,750
I feel like something is pressing my heart.

906
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:40,410
It feels so frustrating,

907
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:42,350
and it makes me sad.

908
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:45,210
What should I do?

909
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:49,010
(Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo)

910
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:51,350
Dad. I hate weightlifting.

911
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:52,780
I want to quit weightlifting, Dad.

912
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:55,010
Go out and do the things you always wanted to do.

913
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:56,780
Why did you want to meet in front of my house?

914
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:59,480
Are you scared that your dad or uncle might see us?

915
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:02,250
It's cold. Why? Did I make your heart flutter?

916
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,780
- Are you really dating her? - You may be right.

917
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:05,910
I think I am dating her.

918
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:09,350
Try to stay in town. Don't go out of my sight. Don't go too far.
