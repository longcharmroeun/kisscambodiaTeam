13
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,810
No, I just came by.

14
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,180
Don't you remember seeing me last night?

15
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,480
You saw me in front of the fridge in the lounge.

16
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,010
Oh, last night.

17
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,940
You must've been surprised. I formed a habit of binging half-asleep.

18
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,080
You're not sick or anything, are you?

19
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,240
What do you mean?

20
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,710
I just heard that there has been a fuss in the dormitory.

21
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,280
Some people say they've seen a ghost.

22
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,640
What does it have to do with me?

23
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,710

(SIDE EFFECTS OF SLEEPING PILLS)

26
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,780
Sleeping pills can cause side effects...

27
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,380
such as drowsiness, and dizziness at first.

28
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,340
You might develop delusions, memory defects,

29
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,610
and even sleepwalking later on.

30
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,980
I'd recommend you to stop taking the pills first.

31
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,610
Please come to the hospital and get checked up as soon as possible.

32
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,110

33
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,810
- Hey, Bok Joo.
- Bok Joo!

34
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,740
It's so nice to see you. Are you back?

35
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,010
Good for you.

36
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,380
You are the glue of your group. Without you here,

37
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,440
your friends seemed depressed, and it made me feel bad.

38
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,940
It's too early to make a fuss. Are you heading out?

39
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:46,850
Yes.

40
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,880

41
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,350

42
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,040
Leave us alone, will you? Take the hint already.

43
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,940
Oh, I get it now.

44
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,810
It's not like you guys are dating. Why do you have secrets?

45
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,850
Just try not to fight.

46
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,410
Anyway, I'll let you two talk. See you later.

47
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,350

00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,480
- Si Ho recently?
- Si Ho?

50
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,310
- Why?
- She just didn't look so good.

51
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,580
Actually, last night...

52
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,410
You're quite nosy. You have your own problems to deal with.

- Bok Joo.
- Yes.

54
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,980
Nothing. I'm being nosy again.

55
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,140
Never mind. I'll go now.

56
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,480
What? What do you want this time?

57
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,510
Didn't you lose anything?

58
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,010
Nothing except my mind.

59
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,980
What's that over there? Wait.

60
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,080
What's that?

61
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,440
What's wrong with you?

62
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,480
You aren't working today, right? What are you doing?

63
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,480
I don't, but why?

64
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,680
So we can hang out.

65
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,440
You said you're up for the experience.

66
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,940
Stop talking nonsense.

67
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,010
Experience what?

68
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,540
You promised to do it for a month.

69
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,240
You can't change your mind now, Miss.

70
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,680
Miss? You've lost your mind.

71
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,710
Be quiet.

72
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,210
I am free at night starting from today.

73
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,040
I'm free after the morning, so think of what you want to do.

74
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,180
I'll call you.

75
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,940
Okay? I'll call you.

76
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,010

77
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,480
Gosh.

78
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,980
He startled me.

79
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,540
Goodness.

80
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,640
He really startled me.

81
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,710
Gosh, that arrogant punk.

82
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,710
Do you know you're allowed to spend the night...

83
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,810
off-campus starting today?

84
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,180
- Yes.
- Yes.

85
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,080
As the weightlifting team,

86
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,580
when you go home, there's something...

87
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,710
you must remember to do.

88
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,840
What is it, Woon Gi?

89
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,640
- It's to eat well.
- That's exactly right.

90
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,680
You haven't been home in a while.

91
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,080
Go home and eat your parents' cooking as much as possible.

92
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,610
Those who had to lose weight are allowed to eat.

93
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,480
It's because when you return,

94
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,280
you must strengthen your muscles.

95
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,710
This isn't a favor. It's an order.

96
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,480
Go and eat!

97
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,680
You must starve.

98
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,080
You'll be in big trouble if you gain any weight.

99
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,140
Just because you have a three-day break...

100
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,280
doesn't mean you eat 1.5 days and starve 1.5 days.

101
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,410
You might think otherwise,

102
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,340
but the scale will always tell the truth.

103
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,580
- Yes.
- Yes.

104
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,010

105
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,880
on the day you come back.

106
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,540
It's a special break before you start the difficult winter training,

107
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,580
so get a lot of rest.

108
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,610
Please stay out of trouble, okay?

109
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,640
- Yes.
- Yes.

110
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,240
- You're dismissed.
- Thank you.

111
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,440

112
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,310

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,180
- Let me go.
- Where are you going?

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,640
- Let me go.
- Wait, don't go.

132
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,310
He's been suspicious lately.

133

Is he hanging out at the Race Park like last time?

134
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,210
No way.

135
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,140

(GOING TO AN AMUSEMENT PARK ON A WEEKDAY AND RIDING FIVE ATTRACTIONS)

182
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,240
How about the amusement park?

183
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,880
It's been such a long time since I've been there.

184
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,510
Amusement park?

185
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,080
How old are you? That's so childish.

186
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,540
What's wrong with that? Let's go.

187
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,480
It won't be crowded since it's a weekday.

188
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,080
Gosh, look at this.

189
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,780
There's a bus that goes directly from here.

190
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,710
We have no reason not to go.

191
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,480
That's true.

192
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,080
Then, shall we go?

193
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,340
Okay, the amusement park is confirmed.

194
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,380
I almost forgot. I'm meeting my friends later.

195
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,140
Do you mean your friends at school?

196
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,180
They wanted to hang out before they go back home.

197
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,180
Gosh, I completely forgot.

198
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,940
Do you have to meet them today when you talked all night long?

199
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,080
Can't you cancel it?

200
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,380
No, they'll throw a fit.

201
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,710
Come on, let's go to the amusement park together.

202
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,710
I'm so excited.

203
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,680
I haven't been here in a long time.

204
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,310
It's my first time being here on a weekday.

205
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,210
It's best to come here on a weekday.

206
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,710
- We don't have to wait in line.
- That's right.

207
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,940
Let's get in first before you start talking.

208
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,110
Otherwise, we won't make it in.

209
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,940
Wait, give me a second.

210
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,210
Is someone else joining us?

211
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,480
Joon Hyung!

212
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,380
Bok Joo!

213
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,110
I called him.

214
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,840
The more the merrier.

215
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,780
This is unbelievable.

216
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,380
You're such a team player.

217
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,840
I ran here as fast as I could after you called me.

218
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,640
You're a traitor.

219
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,840
Why didn't you let me know about this beforehand?

220
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,710
You haven't gone home yet.

221
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,280
I'll take the last bus later.

222
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,010
We don't have anyone else joining us, right?

223
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,880
Let's go in.

224
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,080
Joon Hyung, wait up.

225
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,710
- Let's go.
- It's show time.

226
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,780
Look how pretty this is.

227
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,310
- Look at the hairbands.
- Hey, hey.

228
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,540
- Let's go in.
- Come on, let's go in.

229
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,440
Let's get one each.

230
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,610
Look at this one.

231
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,910
- How do I look?
- That looks so childish.

232
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,540
What's wrong? Everyone gets one at the amusement park.

233
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,680
How about this one for you?

234
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,840
No, I hate things like this.

235
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,640
- Goodness.
- Wow, that one matches mine.

236
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,910
Let's get a couple look.

237
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,240
Those look cute together.

238
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,080
- Honey.
- We look like a couple.

239
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,410
- That hurts.
- There's this one, too.

240
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,440
You said you don't want it.

241
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,210
No, it's mine, okay?

242
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,410
- You said you don't want it.
- It's mine.

243
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,980
It's totally mine. You said it looks good.

244
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,680
This is mine. This is mine!

245
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,680
I'll take this one.

246
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,710
- It's mine.
- Fine, you take it.

247
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,880
It looks good on you since you look like a devil.

248
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,210
Take that one. It looks cute.

249
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,310
- Do I look cute?
- Why isn't there only one of those?

250
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,480
- The eyes look like yours.
- I turned into a devil.

251
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,040
- Really? Thank you.
- It looks cute on you.

252
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,010
It looks great on you.

253
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,040
Doesn't it look cute?

254
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,410
Don't do that.

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,380
The back seat of Pirate Ship is the most exciting.

257
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,040
Of course, Pirate Ship is awesome.

258
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,280
Which one shall we ride next? I want to ride Mad Swing.

259
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,440
I don't like that one.

260
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,480
I want to go on the merry-go-round to take good selfies.

261
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,040
I'm in. Merry-go-round is the best for selfies.

262
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,840
I'm in, too.

263
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,140
When will I get a chance to ride that again?

264
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,210
Why would we ride a merry-go-round? We aren't children.

265
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,780
I want to ride Mad Swing.

266
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,640
I want to ride Mad Swing, too.

267
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,910
Aren't you afraid of heights?

268
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,980
- You were about to barf...
- No, I'm not.

269
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,610
I came here to ride Mad Swing. I love that ride.

270
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,640
I love Mad Swing. I love it so much.

271
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,240
I have to ride it today. I must ride it now. Right now.

272
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,240
Then let's split up...

273
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,580
and meet again here in 30 minutes, okay? Go.

274
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,680
- Hey, Joon Hyung!
- Let's go ride the merry-go-round.

275
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,410
- Come on.
- Let's take selfies.

276
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,040
Are you going to be okay? Are you riding this just because of me?

277
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,310
No, I like this.

278
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,540
You look so pale, though.

279
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,340
I have pale skin.

280
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,540
I won't worry about you, then.

281
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,510
- Gosh, hold on.
- Here we go.

282
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,040
Safety harness, checked.

283
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,180
I like this ride.

284
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,410
This is the most thrilling moment. Oh, my goodness.

285
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,410
Here we go.

286
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,480

00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,940
Stop!

292
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,980
You're not passed out, are you?

293
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,540
Gosh, Bok Joo is like the energizer bunny.

294
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,480
I feel nauseous right now.

295
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,910
What should I get for her?

296
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,210
Corn dog.

297
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,840
Churros.

298
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,340

Okay. What a great timing.

301
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,980
Hello. I'd like two churros...

302
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,540
and a cup of soda with two straws.

303
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,010
Nice, churros!

304
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:15,080
- Why did you only get one drink?
- I just want a sip.

305
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,380
What is it?

306
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,580
Is your heart fluttering?

307
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,280
That's quite a look on your face you got there.

308
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,910
What are you talking about? You're crazy.

309
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,040
Hey! That was so sudden. I'm just startled.

310
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,780
I don't want this. You drink it all.

311
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,680
All right, sorry. You can have it all. I won't drink any.

312
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,380
- Hey, Nan Hee.
- Where are you guys now?

313
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,940
Come to the square right now. There will be fireworks.

314
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,340
Okay.

315
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,810
Hey, let's go watch the fireworks!

00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,940
I'd recommend you to stop taking the pills first.

317
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,080
Please come to the hospital and get checked up as soon as possible.

318
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,340

It's cold. Use what you can.

322
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,840
What's wrong?

323
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,480
Is your heart fluttering again?

324
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,240
It is, isn't it?

325
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,580
Will you be in need of emergency cardiac care soon or what?

326
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,880
I won't stop you if you want to experience it,

327
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,680
but your safety is my priority.

328

I'm very worried about you now.

329
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,880
You... You're such a lunatic!

330
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,880
You've been going on about it all day long. You're too much.

331
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,110
Get out of my way! I can't stand you because you're so annoying.

332
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,180
Where did these guys go? Goodness.

333
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,610
Gosh, was I too forward with her?

334
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,610
She was already feeling uncomfortable.

335
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,440
I thought going by her bucket list was a great strategy.

336
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,710
- Gosh, this is amazing.
- Nan Hee, let's take a photo.

- It looks so pretty from here.
- Hey, guys.

338

- What took you so long?
- Where have you been?

339
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,840
- It looked even cooler earlier.
- I missed out.

340
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,650
- I want to take photos of it.
- You should.

341

All right, it's time to practice.

You're doing that again.

352

You're going too fast. You have to follow the beat.

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,510
I'm sorry. I'm used to doing things with all of my might.

356
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,380
Repeat it 10 times. If you don't get this right,

357
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,340
- we won't be able to progress.
- Okay.

358
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:19,140
Gosh, why can't I do this? Do I have no sense of rhythm or what?

359
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:27,380
He hasn't called me at all today. Were you all talk?

360
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,440
Or are you taking today off?

361
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,610
- Hey, Nan Hee.
- Bok Joo.

362
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:37,210
Are you back at school now? Did you get some rest at home?

363
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,810
Yes, I'm back at school now.

364
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,540
But Seon Ok isn't back yet.

365
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,080
I think she can't leave home for some reason.

366
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,980
So...

367
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,640
- you want to go to Seon Ok's place?
- Yes.

368
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,210
I think I should.

369
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,680
Her phone is off, too. I'm worried about her.

370
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,940
All right. Then...

371
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,710
you should go.

372
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,480
You're getting dialysis today, right?

373
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,710
- Did Uncle go out again?
- Yes. He said that...

374
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:12,040
his friend is throwing a birthday party for his daughter today.

375
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,610
It's probably a lie, though.

376
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,010
- Get going.
- I'll see you later, Dad.

377
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,610
Make sure you take a taxi, okay?

378
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,640
Bye, Dad.

379
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,880
(CHEONJI MOTEL)

380
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,280
Bok Joo.

381
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,010
This place is in the middle of nowhere. It was so hard to find it.

382
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,710
Why did you come all the way here?

383
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,180
Hello. Just a second, okay?

384
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,610
- For half a day or overnight stay?
- Half a day, please.

385
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:20,640
It'll be 20 dollars.

386
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,440
Bok Joo, wait for me in this room. I'll be right back.

387
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,510
This way, please.

388
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,880
Why are you standing up? Have a seat.

389
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:08,610
Do you want some yogurt?

390
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,110
No, I'm okay.

391
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,710
Drink it. It's the only drink we have here.

392
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,310
- Here.
- Okay.

393
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,140
Thank you.

394
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,580
Sit down.

395
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,710
I guess you were worried.

396
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,640
Did Nan Hee call you?

397
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,240
Yes.

398
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,540
What happened?

399
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,780
My parents want me to drop out of school.

400
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:39,580
They think I'll never make the national team,

401
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,010
and I won't earn much money in a semi-professional team.

402
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,610
I may not even get into one.

403
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,940
They want me to work here and not waste the tuition.

404
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,710
They're short of hands here.

405
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,710
My parents even do wall papering as a part-time job.

406
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,710
I also have a younger sibling.

407
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,940
I didn't know how to answer my parents.

408
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,710
It's true that I have no talents for weightlifting.

409
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,380
What do you mean? When you were in high school, you won a prize...

410
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,840
- at a provincial tournament...
- That was effort, not talent.

411
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,640
Guess what my nickname was in high school.

412
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,280
Weightlifting Ghost.

413
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,140
It's because I never left the gym just like the ghost in the story.

414
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,280
Back then, I stayed there not because I liked weightlifting,

415
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,710
but because I hated to be home.

416
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,440
I didn't want to be at the front desk in our motel.

417
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,340
Weightlifting was the only excuse I could give to escape here.

418
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,980
But somewhere along the way,

419
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,580
I actually started to like weightlifting.

420
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,910
It's an honest sport.

421
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,980
People appreciate exactly how much I lift.

422
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,440
I envy you, Bok Joo.

423
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,610
You have talents,

424
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,680
and a father who heartily supports you.

425
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,980
I'd be grateful if my parents wouldn't be so opposed to it.

426
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,780
Seon Ok.

427
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,340
I told you to take out the trash.

428
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,310
Don't leave it lying around outside like that.

429
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,710
- Hello.
- Hi.

430
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,510
Mom, this is my friend, Bok Joo.

431
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,140
I've mentioned her before. She's my best friend at school.

432
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,410
I see.

433
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,840
What brings you all the way here?

434
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,110
- Did you give Seon Hee dinner?
- Not yet.

435
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,580
Can't you just let her eat ramyeon?

436
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,010
Why would you let her eat ramyeon when we have food here?

437
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,010
Go and prepare dinner for her.

438
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,210
While you're at it, hang out the laundry as well.

439
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,010
Seon Ok. I should get going now.

440
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:50,710
No. You came all the way here. Let's go together.

441
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,180
Let's have dinner, spend the tonight, and go back tomorrow.

442
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,880
No. My dad will worry. I'll just go.

443
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,010
Goodbye.

444
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,410
- See you later.
- All right. Goodbye.

445
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,580
Sir. Are you okay?

446
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,410
Can I get some help over here?

447
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,480
The girl who will receive these will be so happy.

448
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,310
It's for your girlfriend, right?

449
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,580
Well...

450
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,280
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

451
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,540
Thank you.

452
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,680
Please come again.

453
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,010
I hope this will work.

454
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,840
I guess Bok Joo is a girl after all.

455
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:13,010
I thought she would hate flowers because she can't eat them.

456
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,880
Hey, Joon Hyung.

457
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,340
- Where are you?
- I'm in Daejeon.

458
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,240
I came to see Seon Ok. I'm on my way home now.

459
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,040
Why did you go there?

460
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,540
It's a long story. I'll tell you later.

461
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,710
I should get on the bus now.

462
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,280
So you're getting on the bus from Daejeon, right?

463
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,410
Okay. Be careful on your way.

464
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:46,910
My gosh.

465
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,680
(READY TO GO OUT HAIR SALON)

466
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,310
Now I'm all ready to go out.

467
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,180
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

468
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,510
What do you want to do? Do you want to catch a movie...

469
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,840
- or get a couple's massage?
- Dae Ho.

470
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,140
Wait.

471
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,340
I'm very sorry,

472
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,340
but I actually...

473
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,480
Hello, Professor Yoon?

474
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,580
I'm still talking to the school.

475
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,980
I'm asking them to hire you back,

476
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,010
so you should be patient.

477
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,240
I'm fine.

478
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,180
I'm doing okay at the hair salon.

479
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,040
How are the kids? Are they well?

480
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,480
I heard about Bok Joo...

481
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,640
from Bok Joo's uncle.

482
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,480
Well... It just happened.

483
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,640
I guess it's not bad for her to take a break.

484
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:48,610
Seong Eun.

485
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,710
You'll get enough protein from this.

486
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,710
I'm good.

487
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,780
By the way,

488
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,710
when did you two become so close?

489
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,940
I didn't know you see each other outside.

490
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,580
Well...

491
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,510
Actually, we...

492
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:03,680
We're friends.

493
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,340
We're drinking buddies.

494
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,710
I see. You're drinking buddies.

495
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,810
Everyone needs a drinking buddy.

496
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,180
Let's drink.

497
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,340
Oh, wait. Professor.

498
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:18,180
Gosh. You should be more careful.

499
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,280
Goodness.

500
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:28,240
But somewhere along the way, I started to like weightlifting.

501
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,110
It's an honest sport.

502
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,910

503
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,610
I envy you, Bok Joo.

504
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,380
You have talents,

505
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,310
and a father who heartily supports you.

506
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:47,240
(A YEAR AGO)

507
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,210
I lifted it!

508
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:23,080
There was a time when I genuinely liked weightlifting.

509
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,940
Hello?

510
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,040
Is this the guardian of Mr. Kim Chang Geol?

511
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,840
This is Gangdong Hospital.

512
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,010
What is this regarding?

513
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,340
I bought flowers and offered to be her temporary boyfriend.

514
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,540
Bok Joo makes me do all kinds of things.

515
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,980
(BUS TERMINAL)

516
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,510
Bok Joo.

517
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,510
Bok Joo.

518
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,280
Joon Hyung. I have to get to the hospital now.

519
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,280
My dad was getting a dialysis and...

520
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,050
- Calm down, Bok Joo.
- I have to get to the hospital.

521
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:07,880
What should I do? What if something goes wrong with my dad?

522
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,010
He's in the hospital, right?

523
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,840
They must've helped him right away.

524
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,050
It'll be okay, then. Let's go. I'll take you to the hospital.

525
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,880
Dad. Dad...

526
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,510
Dad...

527
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,210
We're looking for a patient.

528
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:25,180
- His name is Kim Chang Geol.
- He's in Room 1101.

529
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,310
- Room 1101?
- Yes.

530
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,610
Bok Joo. He's in here.

531
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,710
Dad.

532
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,240
Dad!

533
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,880
Dad...

534
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,980
Chang Geol!

535
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:46,980
Mr. Kim.

536
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:48,880
He's here.

537
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:50,640
Chang Geol.

539
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,980
Dad. Are you okay?

540
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:17,580
Chang Geol. I'm so sorry.

541
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,340
Please don't die.

542
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,140
Gosh, you're so noisy. I'm fine.

543
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,840
Why are you making a big fuss?

544
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:25,940
Please don't be sick.

545
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,680
Doctor. My dad is okay, right?

546
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:33,680
He isn't going to die, right? I can't live without him.

547
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,810
He's not in a critical state,

548
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,910
but his phosphorus level is high.

549
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,910
His blood creatinine level is also over 10.

550
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,550
He should stay in the hospital for a few days and get a full checkup,

551
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,640
but I think he should get a transplant as soon as possible.

552
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,710
A transplant?

553
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,550
You should rest up without stressing yourself until tomorrow.

554
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,810
- Okay.
- Yes, Doctor.

555
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,010
No, I'm sorry, Chang Geol.

556
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:00,580
Dad, Dad.

557
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,050
My goodness.

558
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,510
- Long time no see.
- Here you go.

559
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,610
I haven't seen you in a while, Jae Yi.

560
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,510
Let's have a shot.

561
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,680
Let's cheer.

562
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:19,510
You two have been close ever since school.

563
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,050
Why don't you just get married? Wouldn't that be nice?

564
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,810
Do you want to get married?

565
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,880
Come on, friends don't get married.

566
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,840
- Gosh.
- I got rejected.

567
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,180
I feel totally embarrassed.

568
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,880
Gosh, look who's here. It's Sang Gu and Hwan Hee.

569
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,280
I got a call from Sang Gu.

570
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,080
He said he's seeing her tonight. I didn't think they'd come.

571
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,610
I haven't seen you guys in a while. It's great to see you.

572
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,910
How have you been?

573
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,510
Have you been well, Jae Yi?

574
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,840
Yes.

575
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,510
- How about you?
- Me, too.

576
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,710
You haven't changed at all.

577
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,050
I was surprised when I first saw you.

578
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,840
You're exactly like how I remember you.

579
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,380
Let's have a drink, Jae Yi. I haven't seen you in a long time.

580
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,050
I won't drink anymore. I have work tomorrow.

581
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,140
You're still so proper.

582
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,580
You were like that before.

583
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,940
You were very proper and nice.

584
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,980
You were popular among women.

585
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,340
- Isn't he your ideal type?
- Why are you bringing up the past?

586
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,840
You still like men like him, don't you?

587
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,710
You said you don't like me because I have no manners.

588
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:33,380
She still gives me a hard time.

589
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,910
Maybe it's because she hates me or because she couldn't...

590
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,480
forget about you.

591
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,380
Pardon me, but I'm leaving.

592
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:43,710
I'm sorry, everyone. See you later.

593
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,810
Hey, what's wrong?

594
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,710
It'd be sad if you leave.

595
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:52,380
Hwan Hee probably counted the days until she could see you again.

596
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,980
Stay here a little longer.

597
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,510
Sit back down.

598
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,510
Sit down!

599
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,280
Please stop.

600
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,410
You'll regret this tomorrow morning.

601
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,340
Hey, you.

602
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:10,080
I'm not drunk. I'm only telling you the facts.

603
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:11,410
Hwan Hee.

604
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:14,110
Didn't you want to come to Seoul to see this guy?

605
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,810
- Here he is.
- What's wrong with you?

606
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:19,480
- You're too drunk. Let's go.
- Let me go.

607
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,680
Look at him as much as you want now.

608
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,640
- Ouch.
- Goodness.

609
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,840
Jae Yi.

610
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,710
Didn't you know that Sang Gu talks without manners?

611
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,580
You should have just ignored him.

612
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,380
Did you have to punch him?

613
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:50,840
You're not a child.

614
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,580
Are you an adolescent?

615
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,110
Usually, you're reasonable...

616
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,050
and don't lose your temper.

617
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,140
Why were you so upset?

618
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,380
Were you annoyed by Sang Gu?

619
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,880
Or was it because of Hwan Hee?

620
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,610
Do you still have feelings for her?

621
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,310
- No, it's not that.
- Then what is it?

622
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,080
I'm tired of you being stuck on your first love.

623
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:22,680
Isn't it about time...

624
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,280
that you forget and date other people?

625
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,610
Let's go. It's late.

626
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,280
When will you ever consider me?

627
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,140
You didn't know?

628
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,110
For the sake of our 10-year friendship,

629
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,710
do you think...

630
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:46,280
I stayed by your side like a shadow?

631
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,140
Ah Young.

632
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:54,810
You had no idea, did you?

633
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,880
That means you've never...

634
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,610
considered me as your potential girlfriend.

635
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,640
I suspected it,

636
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,580
but it feels worse to confirm it.

637
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,680
Ah Young.

638
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,340
Fine.

639
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,550
I'm tired of liking you, too.

640
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,680
I'm tired of wishful thinking.

641
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,310
I think it's better to stop now.

642
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,980
This is the end.

It's okay. Just go home.

- I don't want to.

Bok Joo, just go home.

648
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,710
There's only one bed for the guardian.

649
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,610
- It's already too small.
- Go home now.

650
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,680
You're only being a nuisance.

651

The whole family doesn't need to be here.

652
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,210
I still want to stay here.

653
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,980
You're annoying me. Go home. I need some rest.

654
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,710
I'll get some things you need downstairs. You don't have tissue.

660
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,840
I should pack some inner wear.

Why aren't you sleeping?

What about you?

678
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:13,780
- Were you sleeping?
- I'm about to sleep.

679
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:15,840
Why are you still awake?

680
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,580
Are you scared to sleep alone?

Dad.

684
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,840
I'm sorry.

685
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:36,010
What are you sorry about?

686
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,780
Just everything.

687
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:40,710
I'm sorry about everything.

I'm sorry for making you worry.

689
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:49,340
I'm sorry for making deliveries when you told me not to.

690
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:55,410
I'm also sorry that I was rude to you.

691
00:45:56,810 --> 00:45:57,940
When I was a kid, I used to...

692
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:01,540
complain that your gimbap is ugly and didn't eat it. I'm sorry.

693
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,440
Cut it out, you silly.

694
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:09,110
I'm more sorry.

695
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,580
I'm sorry that I made you do weightlifting,

696
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,440
and I feel bad that I had no choice but to run a fried chicken place...

697
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,140
to raise you.

698
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,710
What I'm most sorry about...

699
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:26,240
is the fact that you...

700
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:31,080
never got...

701
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,610
to say the word "mom" when you were growing up.

702
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:39,210
That's not your fault.

703
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:40,980
It's Mom's fault.

704
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,680
Still, I'm sorry.

705
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:46,580
I want to apologize to you on her behalf.

706
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,510
I'm really sorry.

707
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,340
I felt so bad about it...

708
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:57,510
the whole time you were growing up.

709
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,010
Don't say that. I'm the one who should apologize.

710
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,910
I'm really sorry, Dad.

711
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,380
You should go to bed now.

712
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:13,940
Good night.

713
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:36,140

715
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,940
Good morning, Professor Yoon. Did you have breakfast?

716
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:14,580
It looks like you slept in today.

717
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:16,010
Your hair...

718
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,710
is all messy.

719
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:19,880
Bok Joo.

720
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,680
What's going on?

721
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:24,380
- Are you back now?
- Sophomore at Haneol,

722
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,940
Kim Bok Joo, is back on the weightlifting team...

723
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:28,840
for the winter training after a short hiatus.

724
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,240
I report my return to you. Salute!

725
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,110
I haven't seen your smile in such a long time.

726
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:38,710
Good.

727
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,710
That's the spirit of a weightlifter.

728
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,610
This is great. I'm glad to have you back.

729
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:46,980
With you gone,

730
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,980
the weightlifting room felt so empty.

731
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:51,340
I'm sorry to have worried you, Professor Yoon.

732
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,280
It's okay.

733
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:57,310
I'm grateful that your deviation didn't last long.

734
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:01,710
I was only gone for a short while,

735
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:04,080
but this place has gotten so messy and disorganized.

736
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:06,080
It's the freshmen's job to keep this space tidy.

737
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,710
Where did their discipline go?

738
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:10,110
I'll assemble them and train them properly.

739
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:11,910
Okay. Teach them a lesson.

740
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,510
They're dead now.

741
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,410
Oh, Bok Joo!

742
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,910
- Hi!
- Hey, what happened?

743
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,640
- Are you back now?
- Why did you disappear?

744
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,440
It wasn't because of us, was it?

745
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,780
We were never harsh on her, right? Were you sick?

746
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,780
You should've told us if you were sick.

747
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,410
We were so worried about you.

748
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:34,940
I'm really sorry. I'll be on my best behavior from now on!

749
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:36,710
You're back, so all is good now.

750
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:38,140
Stop giving her a hard time.

751
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:40,540
Look at this one. She's crying.

752
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,210
Bok Joo...

753
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:45,440
Gosh, Bok Joo!

754
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:50,040
What is wrong with you? You're overreacting.

755
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:51,840
Seon Ok is gone, too.

756
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:54,110
Do you know how lonely I've been?

757
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:58,440
If you talk about quitting weightlifting once again,

758
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,610
I'm going to crush you with a barbell.

759
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,280
Gosh, how scary. I'm so scared.

760
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,610
I won't say it ever again. I'm sorry.

761
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,710
Woon Gi, have everyone warm up and get ready for the training.

762
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,780
Okay. Guys, let's start.

763
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,210
- Okay.
- All right.

764
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,710
If Seon Ok was here,

765
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,840
our trio would be complete again. It's too bad.

766
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,880
I actually went to see her yesterday.

767
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,980
What did she say? When is she coming back?

768
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:26,140
I don't think she'll be able to come back for a while.

769
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,210
I missed you. My life without you girls has been so tough.

770
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:34,410
I kept having dreams about the ghost and...

771
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,940
Seon Ok left me, too.

772
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:41,880
Whom did you eat with?

773
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:44,210
- By myself.
- Gosh, I'm sorry.

What are you doing now? What just happened?

Even junior high gymnasts don't make mistakes like that.

779

What is the matter with you, seriously?

780
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,980
You're experienced enough to know how to manage stress.

781
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:17,480
You can't keep doing this. I'll check on you again tomorrow...

782

That means you've never...

considered me as your potential girlfriend.

787
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:46,910
I'm tired of liking you, too.

788
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:49,380
I think it's better to stop now.

Why did you go back all of a sudden?

Why did you come running? There's no hurry.

834
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,780
I was worried you'd be cold. When did you get here?

835
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,840
- How is your dad? Is he okay?
- Yes.

836
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:15,780
He got a checkup, and they said he's not in a critical state.

837
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:19,640
They think he will need to have a kidney transplant soon.

00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,840
That's a relief. I was worried.

Thank you.

If it wasn't for you, I would've been so flustered.
