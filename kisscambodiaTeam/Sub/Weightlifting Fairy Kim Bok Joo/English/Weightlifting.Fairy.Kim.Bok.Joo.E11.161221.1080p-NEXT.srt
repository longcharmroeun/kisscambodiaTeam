1
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,639
I made up some excuse...

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,839
and told them that she got sick after the competition.

3
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:13,979
Yes.

4
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:17,009
We decided to reschedule the meeting.

5
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:19,279
Gosh, really?

6
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:22,779
I'm really sorry that it's gotten complicated.

7
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:23,879
It's all right.

8
00:00:24,979 --> 00:00:26,509
I think Bok Joo was upset...

9
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:28,339
about Coach Choi.

10
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:30,709
Her friends are looking for her.

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,079
I'll call you as soon as we find her.

12
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:34,539
Okay.

13
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:37,009
I'll also keep looking. Thank you.

14
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:39,179
Did they postpone the meeting?

15
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:43,309
That little brat, where did she go?

16
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:44,709
When she comes back,

17
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:46,039
I'll scold...

18
00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:49,679
Hey, Bok Joo!

19
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:52,909
You punk! Where have you been?

20
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:54,839
We've been looking everywhere for you.

21
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:57,239
First, call Professor Yoon. Now!

22
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:00,409
Dad.

23
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:03,979
Dad.

24
00:01:05,039 --> 00:01:06,349
I don't like weightlifting.

25
00:01:07,779 --> 00:01:09,039
I don't want to do it anymore.

26
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:12,309
What...

27
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:15,779
What did you say? You don't want to do what?

28
00:01:16,179 --> 00:01:17,349
She doesn't like...

29
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:19,579
weightlifting anymore.

30
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:21,349
What do you mean, all of a sudden?

31
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:23,139
Explain what you mean.

32
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:25,909
Dad.

33
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:28,379
No matter what others said about...

34
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:32,479
how strange it is for a girl to like weightlifting,

35
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,379
I liked weightlifting.

36
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,609
I liked the metallic smell of the barbells.

37
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:42,409
I liked the smell of the chalk powder at the gym.

38
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:45,179
Weightlifting was fun, and it made me happy.

39
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:47,909
Now, I don't like it.

40
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,939
I hate weightlifting.

41
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:53,509
It doesn't make me happy at all.

42
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:58,979
I don't want to do weightlifting anymore.

43
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,779
I don't want to do anything. What should I do now, Dad?

44
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,509
Poor Bok Joo.

45
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,179
Hey, Joon Hyung.

46
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:21,749
Where have you been?

47
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:44,209
Why do you have so many secrets lately?

48
00:02:45,779 --> 00:02:46,809
Are you...

49
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:48,379
dating someone?

50
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:00,009
Quack, quack.

51
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:03,679
Quack, quack, quack.

52
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:05,879
- What's that? - Here, it's a toad.

53
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:10,179
Who knows? It may be your lucky charm.

54
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:01,479
She must be a very special friend.

55
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:04,409
- I mean Bok Joo. - Gosh.

56
00:04:07,339 --> 00:04:08,939
Why aren't you saying anything?

57
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:10,839
Are you really dating someone?

58
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:12,679
No, right?

59
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:14,679
I think I am.

60
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:16,109
What?

61
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:18,049
I think I'm in love...

62
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:21,179
with her.

63
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:47,479
(Episode 11, It's the End, It's Not the End)

64
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:58,439
Gosh, in my bowl of beef soup,

65
00:04:58,609 --> 00:05:01,639
there are only two pieces of beef.

66
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,779
That's so interesting.

67
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,009
In Bok Joo's bowl,

68
00:05:06,549 --> 00:05:09,239
let's see, there are 2, 4, 6, 8...

69
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:11,409
Did you give her beef stew?

70
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:14,609
My goodness, you're so honest.

71
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,879
You're not ashamed to discriminate so openly.

72
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:19,179
I like that.

73
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:23,809
Where are you going?

74
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:33,279
Why are you going back in?

75
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:38,709
Gosh, it's so dreary at the house.

76
00:05:40,609 --> 00:05:42,139
It's so suffocating.

77
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:49,379
(Haneol Sport University)

78
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:57,039
After she started weightlifting,

79
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:00,639
she never said it was so hard.

80
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,809
She cried because it's difficult.

81
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,509
I think she meant what she said.

82
00:06:08,109 --> 00:06:10,039
I think Bok Joo is in a slump.

83
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:11,779
As you know,

84
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:13,979
it happens to athletes at least once.

85
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,539
She must feel dispirited...

86
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:18,639
now that the competition is over.

87
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,709
To make matters worse, Coach Choi is no longer here.

88
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:25,039
What do you think we should do?

89
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:49,409
I was about to go to school.

90
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:51,639
Pack up your things at your dormitory.

91
00:06:53,609 --> 00:06:54,779
Just bring the things you need.

92
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:02,509
What do you mean you're taking a break?

93
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:04,309
It just happened.

94
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:06,939
Professor Yoon also said it'd be better for me.

95
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:12,339
Here you go. They're new.

96
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,239
I'll give them to you.

97
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:16,439
Bok Joo, are you sick?

98
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:19,909
Tell us.

99
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:21,409
Why are you taking a break?

100
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,139
Yesterday, you simply disappeared and made us worry.

101
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:27,379
What's going on with you?

102
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:30,439
Listen.

103
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:33,309
I need some time to think.

104
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,309
Think about what?

105
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,639
Why am I doing weightlifting?

106
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:45,039
What does weightlifting mean in my life?

107
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:48,779
Is it something I'm doing because I love it?

108
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:52,109
Why are you asking those questions?

109
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,779
If you don't love it,

110
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:55,739
will you quit? Is that it?

111
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:59,139
You're a traitor, Bok Joo.

112
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:02,909
How can you do this without ever discussing with us?

113
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:09,309
We should let her go for now. She's not leaving us for good.

114
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:10,539
She's only taking a break.

115
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,809
I still don't want to let her go.

116
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:16,009
Coach Choi left, and now it's Bok Joo?

117
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:17,239
Why is everyone leaving?

118
00:08:19,109 --> 00:08:20,379
I'm sorry, Nan Hee.

119
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:22,709
I'm sorry, Seon Ok.

120
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,739
Are you going somewhere?

121
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:58,439
Hey, Chubs.

122
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:00,709
Are you okay?

123
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:03,709
No, I'm not okay.

124
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:05,649
Joon Hyung.

125
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,609
I've packed, and I'm leaving.

126
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:09,439
What?

127
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:12,379
I decided to take a break during winter.

128
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:15,279
I thought I should tell you before I leave.

129
00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:18,579
Thank you for everything.

130
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,409
Good luck with your training.

131
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:23,209
Hey, hey, Bok Joo.

132
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:32,149
The number you have dialed is not available at this moment.

133
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:36,609
Yes.

134
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:39,309
I thought I should tell you.

135
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:41,879
I'm sorry.

136
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:44,079
I'll explain everything later.

137
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,339
Okay.

138
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,879
See you later.

139
00:09:53,979 --> 00:09:55,649
I heard you won't be training this winter.

140
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:56,739
What's going on with you?

141
00:09:56,739 --> 00:09:58,279
Why are you taking a break?

142
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:00,439
Gosh, I want to take a break, too.

143
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:56,939
Gosh, I caught you again.

144
00:10:57,479 --> 00:10:59,539
I think I was born to hunt you down.

145
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,179
Joon Hyung.

146
00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:04,639
What is this? Is it Bungeoppang?

147
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:06,479
Hop on.

148
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,809
You went all the way to the intersection for this?

149
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:24,139
Yes. My dad like their bungeoppang.

150
00:11:24,979 --> 00:11:27,209
He must be feeling terrible because of me.

151
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:29,409
He didn't even eat breakfast.

152
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:34,879
Do you want 1 more? I bought 10 pieces. There're a lot.

153
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,139
I'm good. You should enjoy bungeoppang with someone.

154
00:11:38,409 --> 00:11:39,939
It doesn't taste good to eat it alone.

155
00:11:43,939 --> 00:11:45,739
Do you have to take time off training?

156
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:51,109
- Is it that hard? - It's not exactly hard.

157
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:53,439
I've just lost motivation.

158
00:11:54,909 --> 00:11:57,539
I feel listless. I can't do anything.

159
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,339
What are you going to do during the break?

160
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:04,339
I don't have anything particular on my mind.

161
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:08,639
I'll just help my dad at the restaurant or sleep all day.

162
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:12,209
Maybe I'll go up the mountain and train my spirit.

163
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:13,279
You can't go up the mountain.

164
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:15,039
Try to stay in town.

165
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:16,309
Don't go out of my sight.

166
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:17,709
Don't go too far, either.

167
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:20,779
If you get bored, call me.

168
00:12:21,109 --> 00:12:22,109
I'll hang out with you.

169
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,039
Call me even if you're not bored.

170
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,309
I'll hang out with you anyway. I'll be on standby.

171
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:30,409
Cheer up.

172
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:35,779
You're nothing if you're not perky, but you're not perky right now.

173
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:38,079
Okay.

174
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:39,979
Call me as soon as you wake up.

175
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,809
Call me before you eat and when you go to the bathroom.

176
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:45,109
Are you a pervert? Why would I call you in the bathroom?

177
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,679
Fine. Don't call me in the bathroom.

178
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,679
Call me before and after you eat lunch.

179
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:52,339
Call me before and after you eat dinner, too. Okay?

180
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,079
Why should I call you?

181
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,679
It's not bad enough to call you and report everything...

182
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:59,679
Call me at 7pm, too. I like 7pm. Okay?

183
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,139
Bok Joo, you're awesome.

184
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:08,139
Gosh. You never get better.

185
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:10,979
Bok Joo, you're awesome.

186
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,439
Awesome.

187
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,309
Awesome...

188
00:13:15,109 --> 00:13:16,309
Forget it.

189
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,239
- You know I care about you, right? - I get it. Your arm is heavy.

190
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:26,209
Cheer up.

191
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:28,339
All right. Thank you.

192
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:30,709
Awesome...

193
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:32,939
Awesome.

194
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:38,339
Can I ask something about Bok Joo?

195
00:13:39,739 --> 00:13:40,979
Why did she leave the dormitory?

196
00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:43,839
Did she quit school?

197
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:46,479
Why? Is that what you wish for?

198
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:51,609
No. I don't hate her that much.

199
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:53,509
She's my roommate.

200
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:56,279
You're such a good roommate.

201
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:04,109
Don't.

202
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:07,679
I didn't let you have a break, so you can mop the floor.

203
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:10,579
While you're at it, have a good rest,

204
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,479
or go out and do the things you always wanted to do.

205
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:19,939
Give it to me. You should go to the hospital and get a good dialysis.

206
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:21,539
I'll come with you.

207
00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:22,879
Forget it. You don't need to.

208
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:25,409
I'll go by myself. I don't need anyone to come.

209
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:06,009
The things I want to do.

210
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:07,779
First,

211
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:11,479
studying at a library.

212
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:13,509
Second,

213
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:16,039
learning how to play an instrument.

214
00:16:16,979 --> 00:16:18,009
Piano, maybe.

215
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:19,809
Third,

216
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:23,679
going to an amusement park on a weekday and riding five attractions.

217
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:25,939
They must include Mad Swing, and Pirate Ship.

218
00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:28,309
Fourth,

219
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:30,839
getting myself a boyfriend.

220
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:35,639
Sharing a drink with two straws with him.

221
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,779
Putting my hands in my boyfriend's pocket while walking.

222
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:43,639
Getting a hundred roses from him.

223
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:58,079
So why is Bok Joo taking a break?

224
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:00,909
What's the reason?

225
00:17:00,909 --> 00:17:02,909
I don't know. Woon Gi.

226
00:17:03,609 --> 00:17:04,739
Do you know anything?

227
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,139
I don't.

228
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:08,209
I spoke her on the phone, but she didn't say much.

229
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:10,439
Maybe they know.

230
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,609
Hey. What's going on with Bok Joo?

231
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:16,849
I think she just doesn't feel so well.

232
00:17:16,979 --> 00:17:19,939
Don't be ridiculous. We don't take a break whenever we don't feel good.

233
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:26,679
I knew it.

234
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:29,539
You're working hard even though I didn't ask you to.

235
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:31,979
I wish all the students were like you.

236
00:17:31,979 --> 00:17:33,509
I don't need to do anything.

237
00:17:34,379 --> 00:17:36,439
Min Young, you cut your hair.

238
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:38,079
My hair has been short for three years.

239
00:17:38,709 --> 00:17:40,909
Is that so? It looks shorter today.

240
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:42,739
Maybe your face grew longer, then.

241
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:50,909
All right. As you know, the winter training finally begins today.

242
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:54,509
So don't slack off just because the tournament is over.

243
00:17:54,939 --> 00:17:58,209
Today's practice gives you tomorrow's good result.

244
00:17:58,479 --> 00:18:00,239
You should work hard. Okay?

245
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:06,439
Okay. Good.

246
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:08,179
Continue warm-up exercises,

247
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:10,179
and start practicing your snatch afterwards.

248
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:12,879
Guys, you can do it!

249
00:18:17,739 --> 00:18:18,739
All right.

250
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:32,439
Woon Gi. What is it?

251
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,409
I was wondering what will happen to Coach Choi.

252
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:39,639
I'm pressuring the dean about it.

253
00:18:40,139 --> 00:18:42,139
She will return soon.

254
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:45,139
So don't mind it. Just focus on your training.

255
00:18:46,139 --> 00:18:47,409
That's how you can help Coach Choi.

(Professor Yoon)

260
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:24,179
They must have started the winter training by now.

261
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:29,109
Seong Eun. Get the towels from the washer.

262
00:19:31,139 --> 00:19:32,209
Okay.

263
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:44,979
Hello? This is Choi Seong Eun.

264
00:19:45,349 --> 00:19:46,779
Hi, this is Kim Dae Ho.

265
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:51,579
You're Bok Joo's uncle, aren't you?

266
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:53,349
Are you free tonight?

267
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:55,579
I want to buy you a drink.

- No. - How old are you?

272
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:02,409
- Ji Yeon, go practice. - Okay.

273
00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:03,409
You, too.

274
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:06,239
If you're completely new to this,

275
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:08,479
you'll need three lessons a week.

276
00:21:09,209 --> 00:21:11,349
It'll be 150 dollars for a month.

277
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:17,039
Gosh, it's expensive. It's more expensive than I expected.

278
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:21,809
I need to get a part-time job to be able to afford it.

279
00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:24,849
Is there any high-paying job I can pick up?

280
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:30,779
- Hello. - Hello, Sir.

281
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:33,939
- Gosh, it's okay. - I'll just take them in.

282
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:34,979
Thank you.

Dr. Jeong is still as kind as ever.

Gosh, whatever.

285
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,339
I need to find a part-time job.

286
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:55,009
Part-time job! Where can I work?

287
00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:57,139

291
00:22:04,939 --> 00:22:06,879
don't last a week here.

292
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:08,879

293
00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:10,139

00:22:11,209 --> 00:22:13,979
I sincerely appreciate your concern,

295
00:22:14,109 --> 00:22:15,409

That's a sport, and this is work.

Hold on.

Are you having dinner with her?

You sure know how to win ladies' hearts.

Fine. I know what I've done, so I can't really deny it.

But I don't think it's a fair judgement.

My life motto is not being a jerk.

332
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,509
That makes it worse.

333

Is she doing well?

00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:20,439
Why do you ask?

339
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:21,939
I can't even ask you how she's doing?

340
00:24:22,939 --> 00:24:24,479
I'm still worried about her, you know.

341
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:26,909
Goodness. Just forget it. You can stop worrying about her.

342
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:31,379
Don't show interest in her. You're still dangerous.

343
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,379
I'll take care of her.

I don't even know.

350
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,139
I must be out of my mind.

351
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:53,079
I mean, she's really not my type.

352
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:55,309

Good luck. She's cute.

357
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:06,339
Is that why you rejected her?

358
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:09,679
You made her cry. You're so slow-witted.

359
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:12,939
You should've known when she was asking you, "Do you like Messi?"

360
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,909
I told you. I had no idea that was what she meant.

361
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:19,279
So?

362
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:21,309
When are you going to tell her?

363
00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:24,439
I'll have to see.

364
00:25:24,879 --> 00:25:26,439
It's not the right time yet.

365
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,239
- She's in a bit of a slump now. - Really?

366
00:25:29,639 --> 00:25:31,039
She's taking a break from training, too.

367
00:25:32,139 --> 00:25:35,139
I'll help her get through the phase and wait for the right time.

368
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:36,439
Gosh, look at you.

369
00:25:36,939 --> 00:25:38,339
You're really serious about her, aren't you?

370
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:40,509
We sure do share the same blood.

371
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:42,439
I can see that you really like her.

372
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:43,909
Yes. Did you think I was making it up?

373
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:49,079
If you make her cry once again,

374
00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:51,279
I'm going to kick your...

375
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:54,709
Gosh, I'm so scared.

376
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:56,539
Are you going to punch me?

377
00:25:57,539 --> 00:25:59,809
Well, I won't punch you.

378
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:05,139
No, it's nothing to be congratulated on.

379
00:26:05,139 --> 00:26:06,709
I'll have to work so hard.

380
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,279
There're so many things that need to be done at the association. Right.

381
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,339
- Hey. - Yes?

382
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:12,579
Professor Seong is now on the board for the association.

383
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:13,679
Will it help us out in any way...

384
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,079
especially at tournaments?

385
00:26:15,979 --> 00:26:18,579
Well... It won't be bad for us.

386
00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:23,539
Gosh, is Si Ho dozing off right now?

387
00:26:23,639 --> 00:26:26,709
What's wrong with her? She has huge under-eye dark circles, too.

388
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:34,179
- I hope you enjoy it. - Thank you.

389
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:37,209
Is gukbap all you want to eat?

390
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:38,509
I wanted to get you something fancy.

391
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,609
I've been craving this restaurant's gukbap.

392
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,479
We used to come here all the time, you know.

393
00:26:42,939 --> 00:26:44,439
To the point that we got sick of it.

394
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:47,039
This place hasn't changed at all.

395
00:26:47,379 --> 00:26:49,679
Of course. Only people change.

396
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:53,539
Oh, right. Sang Gu didn't show up.

397
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:55,379
He said something came up.

398
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,409
I wanted to see if he's doing well.

399
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:00,909
Really?

400
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,139
By the way,

401
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:03,779
what's going on between Joon Hyung and Bok Joo?

402
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:05,179
Has there been any progress?

403
00:27:07,439 --> 00:27:08,439
I'm not sure.

404
00:27:09,109 --> 00:27:10,909
I hope they end up dating each other.

405
00:27:11,439 --> 00:27:13,909
The foxy types aren't right for Joon Hyung.

406
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:15,379
Someone like Bok Joo is perfect for him.

407
00:27:16,209 --> 00:27:17,279
She has such a cool personality.

408
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:19,309
Like me.

409
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:22,979
That's what you wanted to say.

410
00:27:25,209 --> 00:27:26,479
I hope things go well for them, too.

411
00:27:29,139 --> 00:27:30,139
Chang Geol.

412
00:27:31,009 --> 00:27:32,739
Chang Geol. We haven't gotten any orders,

413
00:27:32,739 --> 00:27:34,339
so let's just call it a day.

414
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:35,979
I'm not in the greatest mood. What do you say?

415
00:27:37,209 --> 00:27:39,179
That troublemaker.

416
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:43,339
Bok Joo got me all down.

417
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:44,779
Well...

418
00:27:45,739 --> 00:27:47,979
I think we should go play pool.

419
00:27:47,979 --> 00:27:49,939
It'll be a perfect way to lift up our spirits.

420
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:55,009
- Hello. - Goodness!

421
00:28:03,609 --> 00:28:04,979
(Bok Chicken)

422
00:28:04,979 --> 00:28:06,379
Hey, Joon Hyung.

423
00:28:06,639 --> 00:28:07,679
Hello.

424
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,079
This probably isn't the best time to visit us.

425
00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:12,639
Is Bok Joo here? She's not answering her phone.

426
00:28:12,639 --> 00:28:14,139
- She's not here. - Really?

427
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:17,139
She picked up a part-time job. She called and said that she'll be late.

428
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,139
Part-time job?

429
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,109
(Courier Service)

430
00:28:36,639 --> 00:28:38,239
You're so impressive.

431
00:28:38,709 --> 00:28:40,679
It seems that being a weightlifter certainly helps.

432
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:43,239
I've been lifting heavy weights since I was very young.

433
00:28:43,339 --> 00:28:44,609
This is light as a feather to me.

434
00:28:45,609 --> 00:28:46,709
You're cut out for this.

435
00:28:46,739 --> 00:28:48,379
You should stay at this job.

436
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,979
The manager left, so we should go home, too.

437
00:28:52,379 --> 00:28:53,379
All right.

438
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:57,239
You must be hungry.

439
00:28:57,739 --> 00:29:00,509
Yes. I digested my dinner in less than an hour.

440
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:03,039
Do you want to go for udon with me?

441
00:29:03,139 --> 00:29:05,339
Today was your first day, so I'll treat you.

442
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:07,779
Seriously? Can I eat two bowls?

443
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:10,079
I'm rich.

444
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:11,239
I'll buy you dumplings, too.

445
00:29:12,109 --> 00:29:14,009
You're awesome.

446
00:29:14,239 --> 00:29:15,309
Kim Bok Joo!

447
00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:20,979
Joon Hyung, what are you doing here?

448
00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:22,409
What do you think?

449
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:24,779
I came to see you.

450
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:26,879
Really? How did you know that I was here?

451
00:29:26,979 --> 00:29:28,579
I went to your place for fried chicken,

452
00:29:29,739 --> 00:29:30,779
and your uncle...

453
00:29:38,379 --> 00:29:40,739
I'm sorry. Let's go for udon another time.

454
00:29:41,009 --> 00:29:42,039
My friend is here.

455
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:44,279
Oh, your friend can come with us.

456
00:29:46,379 --> 00:29:48,479
I'm allergic to udon noodles.

457
00:29:49,109 --> 00:29:51,579
Get something else. Their stir-fried cartilage dish is very good.

458
00:29:51,879 --> 00:29:53,309
The owner is such a good cook.

459
00:29:53,309 --> 00:29:54,379
Stir-fried cartilage!

460
00:29:56,239 --> 00:29:58,279
When I eat with people I'm not comfortable with,

461
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:02,709
I get panic attacks, become violent, and curse at times.

462
00:30:05,939 --> 00:30:07,779
Joon Hyung, what's wrong with you?

463
00:30:14,209 --> 00:30:15,279
I'm sorry,

464
00:30:15,739 --> 00:30:18,539
but I think he's a little sick.

465
00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:24,179
I'll get going now. See you tomorrow.

466
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:26,009
Let's have udon together next time.

467
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:35,839
You're still young. Stay strong.

468
00:30:39,209 --> 00:30:41,679
What's going on? Are you allergic to udon?

469
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:43,639
Sometimes...

470
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:45,209
when I'm in bad condition.

471
00:30:46,379 --> 00:30:47,379
Let's go.

472
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:51,709
What?

473
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:01,179
Goodness.

474
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:05,479
You're too impatient.

475
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,809
By the way, who was that arrogant-looking guy?

476
00:31:09,979 --> 00:31:11,009
Is he a full-time employee?

477
00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:13,309
That guy?

478
00:31:14,379 --> 00:31:15,709
He's a part-time worker.

479
00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:17,979
He treats me well like his sister.

480
00:31:18,439 --> 00:31:19,539
What?

481
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,479
You talk about him as if he's close to you.

482
00:31:23,209 --> 00:31:26,109
Don't act friendly with everyone.

483
00:31:26,739 --> 00:31:30,339
Except for your dad and uncle, you should keep a distance from men.

484
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:33,979
What about you? Should I also keep a distance since you're a man?

485
00:31:34,879 --> 00:31:36,009
Me?

486
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:39,079
Let me be an exception.

487
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,579
You're ridiculous.

488
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:43,339
How's your part-time job?

489
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:47,239
I heard it's a difficult job even for men.

490
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:50,939
Of course it's difficult. It's different from weightlifting,

491
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:52,479
but it's not so bad.

492
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:55,079
After I work for a while,

493
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:57,209
I start to sweat.

494
00:31:57,409 --> 00:32:00,409
When I drink a cup of instant coffee during break,

495
00:32:00,609 --> 00:32:03,209
it feels amazing.

496
00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:06,809
You sound like you've been doing physical labor for years.

497
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,339
Let me tell you a secret.

498
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:13,779
I'm going to learn how to play the piano with the money I earn.

499
00:32:14,139 --> 00:32:15,139
Piano?

500
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:18,509
Is it piano this time instead of cello?

501
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:21,779
I said cello because I saw one of his decorations.

502
00:32:22,379 --> 00:32:24,539
I've wanted to play the piano ever since I was young.

503
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,609
Every girl in my class could play it except me.

504
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:29,539
All I played was sports when I was young.

505
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:33,439
I also want to learn how to play the cello,

506
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:35,139
but it seems too difficult.

507
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:37,339
It's more expensive than piano lessons.

508
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:41,179
Anyway, I can't wait.

509
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,109
Do, re, mi.

510
00:32:45,579 --> 00:32:46,809
It'll suit you.

511
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:48,609
You have long fingers, too.

512
00:32:48,609 --> 00:32:51,739
I'll play "Wedding March" at your wedding.

513
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:53,409
No, thank you.

514
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:55,409
You'll only ruin my wedding.

515
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:57,209
Instead,

516
00:32:58,179 --> 00:32:59,679
why don't you stand next to me?

517
00:33:00,409 --> 00:33:02,709
Why would I stand next to you instead of your wife?

518
00:33:03,579 --> 00:33:05,139
Fine, don't.

519
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:06,609
Don't stand next to me.

520
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,309
Just eat.

521
00:33:10,579 --> 00:33:13,139
Don't talk to that arrogant guy.

522
00:33:14,009 --> 00:33:15,179
It makes me feel upset.

523
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:17,509
Don't you think he's good-looking?

524
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:24,409
Here. I'd like to hear about you.

525
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:26,139
What are you up to these days?

526
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:28,879
I'm helping out my sister.

527
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:31,439
She runs a hair salon in front of a university.

528
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,609
Scissorhands?

529
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:36,879
Do you even like it?

530
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:40,639
Who cares about that?

531
00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:43,009
I help out with the chores.

532
00:33:43,509 --> 00:33:44,779
Come on.

533
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,739
Let's drink together.

534
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:50,879
Thank you.

535
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:52,979
Here you go.

536
00:33:56,809 --> 00:33:58,739
Are you okay? Can you walk?

537
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:00,579
Can you?

538
00:34:01,009 --> 00:34:02,079
- Excuse me... - Hey.

539
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:05,609
What do you want?

540
00:34:10,279 --> 00:34:11,279
Here you go.

541
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,709
Get on my back.

542
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:17,009
Why are you being good to me?

543
00:34:17,009 --> 00:34:19,539
I'm not being good to you.

544
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:22,479
Offering my back isn't such a big deal. Get on.

545
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:32,709
Mister, do you like me?

546
00:34:34,009 --> 00:34:35,839
What's wrong with this woman?

547
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,409
Listen.

548
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,279
Why would I like an old woman...

549
00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:47,679
Yes, I like you.

550
00:34:48,979 --> 00:34:50,209
I like you, so what?

551
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:52,209
Am I not allowed to like you?

552
00:34:52,609 --> 00:34:54,279
It's okay.

553
00:34:54,779 --> 00:34:56,679
There's nothing wrong with a person liking someone else.

554
00:34:58,409 --> 00:35:00,139
Gosh, what is it?

555
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:04,009
There's one thing that I can't understand at all.

556
00:35:04,779 --> 00:35:06,639
That's love.

557
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:10,779
All right.

558
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:13,709
Why don't we date each other?

559
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:15,709
What?

560
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:17,139
Let's date each other.

561
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:21,309
Before I become an old granny,

562
00:35:23,009 --> 00:35:26,439
let's just date each other like it's not a big deal.

563
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:28,409
Do you mean it?

564
00:35:29,509 --> 00:35:32,839
You're not saying it because you're drunk.

565
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:34,209
Do you really mean it?

566
00:35:35,179 --> 00:35:36,179
Are you being serious?

567
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:37,539
Don't you believe me?

568
00:35:38,839 --> 00:35:39,839
Shall I prove it to you?

569
00:35:52,249 --> 00:35:54,209
You don't have to walk me home.

570
00:35:54,509 --> 00:35:56,379
I can defend myself if someone attacks me.

571
00:35:56,879 --> 00:36:00,579
No way. Even if you're strong, you can't defeat a man.

572
00:36:02,979 --> 00:36:04,709
- Ouch. - What about now?

573
00:36:05,609 --> 00:36:06,639
I was wrong.

574
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:08,909
You'd better watch what you say.

575
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:17,839
Gosh, the winter smells amazing. It's so refreshing.

576
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:22,179
It's cold. I want it to be spring soon.

577
00:36:24,779 --> 00:36:25,809
Joon Hyung.

578
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,809
I saw Dr. Jeong today on the street.

579
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:29,109
Really?

580
00:36:29,909 --> 00:36:31,979
You and Jae Yi bump into each other often.

581
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:34,479
He didn't see me, though.

582
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:37,409
How did you feel seeing him again?

583
00:36:38,009 --> 00:36:40,279
Did seeing him again tear you apart?

584
00:36:40,709 --> 00:36:42,339
It wasn't like that.

585
00:36:43,379 --> 00:36:45,209
It just felt strange.

586
00:36:45,979 --> 00:36:49,139
The days I went to the clinic because I was crazy about him...

587
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:50,709
seem long ago.

588
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:53,179
You know when you catch a cold...

589
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:55,979
but can't get rid of it no matter what you try?

590
00:36:55,979 --> 00:37:00,509
Now, I feel like I'm at the tail end of the cold.

591
00:37:00,979 --> 00:37:02,609
Doesn't that mean you're okay now?

592
00:37:03,709 --> 00:37:04,779
I'm glad to hear that.

593
00:37:05,009 --> 00:37:06,249
I think so.

594
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:11,009
Like you said before, time takes care of everything.

595
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:15,279
Oh, we're here. You should go home now.

596
00:37:16,809 --> 00:37:18,479
Can you walk me to school?

597
00:37:18,939 --> 00:37:21,079
I'll walk you home again after that.

598
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:24,939
Just go alone. I need to rest for extra work tomorrow.

599
00:37:25,249 --> 00:37:27,039
What? You have extra work?

600
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,409
Yes, they told me to work extra tomorrow.

601
00:37:30,279 --> 00:37:32,939
What kind of part-time job is that?

602
00:37:33,409 --> 00:37:34,939
Won't you finish late at night?

603
00:37:35,279 --> 00:37:37,479
It's okay. If I work with that guy, we'll finish early.

604
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:40,379
- That guy? - See you.

605
00:37:41,249 --> 00:37:43,809
Why do you keep mentioning him?

606
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,139
See you later.

607
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:49,439
Why does she talk about him as if they're close friends?

608
00:37:49,709 --> 00:37:53,339
She's friends with anyone who buys her food.

609
00:37:53,439 --> 00:37:54,909
Gosh, what do I do?

610
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:57,079
Should I go there again tomorrow?

611
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:02,879
Darn it!

612
00:38:07,439 --> 00:38:08,479
That guy.

613
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:10,749
Goodness.

614
00:38:32,539 --> 00:38:33,709
A ghost?

615
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:34,839
Yes.

616
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:38,709
Last night, a fencer saw a ghost with bare feet and got shocked.

617
00:38:38,779 --> 00:38:40,679
Maybe she was dreaming.

618
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:42,009
Not everyone with bare feet is a ghost.

619
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:44,539
That's not it. Pale bare feet...

620
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:46,439
were floating above the floor.

621
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:03,909
It's called the barefoot ghost.

622
00:39:04,749 --> 00:39:07,139
According to people, 15 years ago,

623
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,439
she lost her medal for taking drugs.

624
00:39:09,509 --> 00:39:11,679
She was a runner who killed herself by jumping off a building.

625
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:13,609
They think the ghost is her.

626
00:39:13,709 --> 00:39:16,109
- Oh, my gosh. - Is the ghost pretty?

627
00:39:17,979 --> 00:39:19,009
Sorry. Continue.

628
00:39:19,279 --> 00:39:22,039
She took diet pills that her friend gave her.

629
00:39:22,209 --> 00:39:24,249
- Then she failed the drug test. - Goodness.

630
00:39:24,249 --> 00:39:28,439
She turned into a ghost and looked for her friend every night.

631
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:31,309
- My goodness. - That's so scary.

632
00:39:31,409 --> 00:39:33,409
Gosh, it's so scary.

633
00:39:42,909 --> 00:39:45,409
- Bok Joo, come and eat. - Okay.

634
00:39:46,749 --> 00:39:49,179
Why is it sticking to my clothes?

635
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:51,079
Gosh.

636
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:55,749
- What are you doing? - I'm coming.

637
00:39:56,539 --> 00:39:57,839
I'll come out after I get dressed.

638
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,409
Hurry up. The stew will get cold.

639
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,609
It must be soybean paste stew. It smells fantastic.

640
00:40:15,709 --> 00:40:16,939
Do you need a bowl?

641
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:18,309
I'll get it.

642
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:25,979
Give it to me. I'll mix it for you.

643
00:40:30,509 --> 00:40:31,539
Dad.

644
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:33,809
Aren't you going to ask me what kind of a part-time job I got?

645
00:40:36,779 --> 00:40:37,809
I don't need to ask...

646
00:40:38,539 --> 00:40:40,039
as long as it's not something bad.

647
00:40:41,709 --> 00:40:43,279
I won't meddle in everything anymore.

648
00:40:43,879 --> 00:40:46,939
You can go back to school if you ever feel up to it.

649
00:40:47,209 --> 00:40:48,209
Do what you want to do.

650
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:50,009
It's your life, not mine.

651
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:53,979
Here. Try it. I mixed it well.

652
00:40:58,509 --> 00:40:59,679
It's so salty, Dad.

653
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:01,139
Really? I'm sorry.

654
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:06,079
Where did Dae Ho go so early this morning?

655
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:07,679
I haven't seen him all day.

656
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,209
My goodness! I must've been crazy.

657
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:18,879
I won't drink alcohol anymore.

658
00:41:19,209 --> 00:41:21,409
Gosh. Alcohol always gives me trouble.

659
00:41:21,409 --> 00:41:22,909
- What is it? - What should I do?

660
00:41:22,909 --> 00:41:24,909
Did you drink alcohol and do something?

661
00:41:24,909 --> 00:41:27,309
Whatever. This is all your fault.

662
00:41:27,309 --> 00:41:28,939
It's because you borrowed money from me.

663
00:41:29,879 --> 00:41:31,509
Forget it. I shouldn't say more.

664
00:41:32,379 --> 00:41:33,749
What should I do?

665
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:37,379
That's right. I was drunk. Let's just pretend it never happened.

666
00:41:38,249 --> 00:41:40,209
Maybe he was drunk, and he doesn't remember it.

667
00:41:40,579 --> 00:41:42,439
Welcome. Please have a seat here.

668
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:45,509
- What can I do for you? - Well...

669
00:41:50,139 --> 00:41:51,379
What are you doing over there?

670
00:41:57,779 --> 00:41:58,839
Hi.

671
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,109
I brought you hangover food.

672
00:42:03,309 --> 00:42:04,809
Gosh, Bok Joo.

673
00:42:04,809 --> 00:42:06,709
You do your job so well. I like you very much.

674
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:09,839
Right? My dad runs a chicken restaurant,

675
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,439
and he said I'm a natural worker.

676
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:12,809
Do you have a boyfriend?

677
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:14,749
If you don't, I'll introduce you to my nephew.

678
00:42:14,979 --> 00:42:16,039
Really?

679
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:17,909
Shall I meet him?

680
00:42:18,409 --> 00:42:20,339
Hey. You do have a boyfriend.

681
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:22,609
That guy with glaring eyes I saw yesterday.

682
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:24,709
He looks a bit like me.

683
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:26,409
Gosh. He's not my boyfriend.

684
00:42:26,409 --> 00:42:29,109
Come on. I could tell you were more than just friends.

685
00:42:29,109 --> 00:42:30,609
He even glared at me.

686
00:42:30,609 --> 00:42:32,939
He's just a friend who is a guy.

687
00:42:33,479 --> 00:42:35,109
He's just a guy. A human.

688
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:36,839
Aren't I better than him?

689
00:42:37,509 --> 00:42:38,809
You're a lot better.

690
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:40,379
- Gosh. - Gosh.

691
00:42:41,749 --> 00:42:44,479
Sir. When are you going to introduce me to your nephew?

692
00:42:46,009 --> 00:42:47,679
Hey. Let's go out.

693
00:42:47,779 --> 00:42:49,509
Let's go to a cyber cafe and play games.

694
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:51,139
No. I don't feel like it.

695
00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:53,779
Okay. If you're all determined,

696
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:55,249
I'll just go, then.

697
00:42:56,139 --> 00:42:58,439
- Get a good rest by yourself. - Hey!

698
00:42:59,609 --> 00:43:00,679
You punk!

699
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:12,249
Bok Joo. You're even working overtime today.

700
00:43:13,539 --> 00:43:15,279
Oh, that guy?

701
00:43:15,709 --> 00:43:17,109
He's a part-time worker.

702
00:43:17,109 --> 00:43:19,909
He treats me well like his sister.

703
00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:26,309
That sly punk. He definitely gave her a dirty look.

704
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:30,639
- I'll get it from the warehouse. - I'll go with you. It's heavy.

705
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:32,339
Keep moving them.

706
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:34,039
Okay. I'll see you later.

707
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:36,409
My gosh.

708
00:43:36,409 --> 00:43:38,039
My shoelace. Gosh.

709
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:39,639
Goodness.

710
00:43:41,379 --> 00:43:42,439
I can't see it.

711
00:43:47,309 --> 00:43:48,739
How did you get in here?

712
00:43:49,139 --> 00:43:50,939
How else? I just walked in.

713
00:43:52,179 --> 00:43:53,239
Do you still have much to do?

714
00:43:53,509 --> 00:43:54,539
Yes.

715
00:43:54,909 --> 00:43:55,979
What brought you here again?

716
00:43:56,809 --> 00:43:57,839
Nothing.

717
00:43:58,809 --> 00:44:01,379
I went to a club, but the girls weren't pretty.

718
00:44:02,609 --> 00:44:05,579
Don't go to clubs so often. You'll hurt your bones.

719
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:07,239
I'm fine. I have thick bones.

720
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:10,139
If you have much to do, I can help you.

721
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:12,679
It's fine. Just go before people see you.

722
00:44:21,739 --> 00:44:24,039
My gosh. I said it's fine. Hurry up and go.

723
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:26,239
Since I'm here, I'll help you out.

724
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:27,939
You should finish it and go home.

725
00:44:28,839 --> 00:44:30,479
It's not that.

726
00:44:30,479 --> 00:44:32,309
I just don't want people to misunderstand.

727
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:34,239
What do you mean?

728
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,109
They think you're my boyfriend.

729
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:39,109
They won't believe you're just a friend.

730
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:43,809
If they see us, they will definitely misunderstand. So just go.

731
00:44:49,639 --> 00:44:50,709
They didn't misunderstand.

732
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:54,679
What?

733
00:44:57,079 --> 00:44:58,239
You're not just a friend.

734
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:11,539
You're a special friend to me.

735
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:17,439
Can't you see what I'm trying to say?

736
00:45:46,139 --> 00:45:48,709
What... What are you doing? Are you crazy?

737
00:45:48,809 --> 00:45:49,839
Yes. I'm crazy.

738
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,139
If I wasn't, I wouldn't do this.

739
00:45:52,139 --> 00:45:53,209
What?

740
00:45:53,439 --> 00:45:54,509
You fool.

741
00:45:56,579 --> 00:45:57,739
I like you.

742
00:45:59,439 --> 00:46:00,679
Not as a friend, but as a girl.

743
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:05,439
If I don't see you, I get curious.

744
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:06,939
If you're depressed, I get upset.

745
00:46:06,939 --> 00:46:08,809
If you smile, it makes me happy. If you're sick, I get worried.

746
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:10,879
It's driving me crazy.

747
00:46:12,439 --> 00:46:13,479
It means...

748
00:46:14,709 --> 00:46:15,739
I like you, doesn't it?

749
00:46:33,139 --> 00:46:34,639
Gosh, is he asleep already?

750
00:46:35,509 --> 00:46:36,509
Joon Hyung.

751
00:46:37,809 --> 00:46:38,839
Joon Hyung!

752
00:46:41,609 --> 00:46:43,579
Who locked this door?

753
00:46:45,009 --> 00:46:46,309
Gosh, I'm freezing.

754
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:51,239
I can't go home right now, Mom. The winter training has started.

755
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,779
I get a sleepover next week. I'll go home then.

756
00:46:55,539 --> 00:46:58,009
Why don't you just hire someone instead of asking me?

757
00:46:58,539 --> 00:46:59,579
I can't keep...

758
00:47:00,309 --> 00:47:01,809
Mom? Mom...

759
00:47:12,779 --> 00:47:13,809
Who is it?

760
00:47:14,779 --> 00:47:16,309
It's me, Tae Kwon.

761
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:18,609
- What were you doing there? - Well...

762
00:47:18,609 --> 00:47:21,279
I went out to play some games, but someone locked the window.

763
00:47:21,439 --> 00:47:24,239
The window here was open, and your voice sounded familiar.

764
00:47:25,879 --> 00:47:26,909
Did you hear everything?

765
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:30,179
No, I didn't hear what you said. I just heard your voice.

766
00:47:31,709 --> 00:47:32,909
Fine. Just go.

767
00:47:32,909 --> 00:47:34,609
You're going to get me into trouble.

768
00:47:35,479 --> 00:47:38,609
- Well... - Where on earth is Seon Ok?

769
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:53,439
Gosh, my stomach hurts.

770
00:47:54,139 --> 00:47:55,439
Maybe the chicken feet were too spicy.

771
00:47:57,079 --> 00:47:58,979
Why am I the only one with the stomachache?

772
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:02,579
Where did Seon Ok go in the middle of the night?

773
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:26,809
Go! Go away!

774
00:48:26,809 --> 00:48:29,409
Go away! Go!

775
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:30,579
What's wrong?

776
00:48:30,579 --> 00:48:32,509
- There's a ghost. - A ghost?

777
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:35,579
- What's wrong? - Seon Ok. There was a ghost there.

778
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,579
What? Where? There's nothing.

779
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:40,279
- It was there. Where did it go? - Gosh, calm down.

780
00:48:40,479 --> 00:48:42,179
I think it's gone.

781
00:48:42,179 --> 00:48:44,439
- It was definitely there. - Calm down.

782
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:46,609
- My goodness. - Oh, dear.

783
00:48:48,439 --> 00:48:49,509
Stop crying.

784
00:49:07,979 --> 00:49:10,639
Bok Joo. Stop punishing me and talk.

785
00:49:14,479 --> 00:49:15,539
Bok Joo.

786
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:18,909
Why?

787
00:49:19,109 --> 00:49:21,079
Why... Why me?

788
00:49:22,509 --> 00:49:23,509
What?

789
00:49:23,739 --> 00:49:25,839
It just doesn't make sense.

790
00:49:26,009 --> 00:49:29,379
It wasn't long ago when I was crying and upset because of your brother.

791
00:49:29,609 --> 00:49:30,609
How could you...

792
00:49:32,379 --> 00:49:34,609
Is it because you pity me?

793
00:49:34,609 --> 00:49:36,979
Guys I like don't like me back, and I've never had a boyfriend.

794
00:49:36,979 --> 00:49:38,079
Do you feel bad for me?

795
00:49:38,739 --> 00:49:40,309
I don't do charity.

796
00:49:40,809 --> 00:49:42,939
- Why then? - I can't explain why.

797
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:46,339
There is no reason for liking someone.

798
00:49:47,279 --> 00:49:49,109
I like you because I just do.

799
00:49:50,209 --> 00:49:52,509
Besides, I realized that...

800
00:49:53,209 --> 00:49:55,039
I started to like you a long time ago.

801
00:49:58,979 --> 00:50:01,279
You're my first love.

802
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:10,509
What is it supposed to mean? Do you hate me or something?

803
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:14,979
Well... No, I don't hate you.

804
00:50:15,709 --> 00:50:20,539
Gosh, what should I say... All right. I like you, too.

805
00:50:20,879 --> 00:50:23,679
These days, I lean on you more than Seon Ok and Nan Hee at times.

806
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:25,239
You make me feel safe.

807
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:26,879
And...

808
00:50:27,709 --> 00:50:30,739
you're... To be honest, you're a little handsome.

809
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:34,779
I didn't realize it at first, but I've come to admit it.

810
00:50:36,339 --> 00:50:37,579
But...

811
00:50:38,279 --> 00:50:39,309
But?

812
00:50:40,809 --> 00:50:43,279
I like you as a friend.

813
00:50:43,279 --> 00:50:45,709
I've never felt romantically towards you.

814
00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:47,909
Then start now.

815
00:50:49,409 --> 00:50:50,839
Go out with me...

816
00:50:51,309 --> 00:50:52,339
for just one month.

817
00:50:53,309 --> 00:50:55,009
See if you can be attracted to me...

818
00:50:55,109 --> 00:50:57,439
and find out how I can be as a boyfriend.

819
00:50:58,309 --> 00:51:01,239
Get a full experience and decide whether you want to do it or not.

820
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:05,009
Is this a home shopping channel? That sounds ridiculous.

821
00:51:05,279 --> 00:51:07,539
Then are you just going to reject me?

822
00:51:09,339 --> 00:51:11,409
We've been through many things together.

823
00:51:11,739 --> 00:51:13,609
You should at least give me a chance.

824
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:18,409
I'll take that as a yes.

825
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,239
Let's go. It's cold.

826
00:51:23,239 --> 00:51:24,739
Gosh, that lunatic.

827
00:51:27,509 --> 00:51:28,579
Are you not coming?

828
00:51:28,879 --> 00:51:31,179
What should I do? Goodness.

829
00:51:31,609 --> 00:51:32,739
Gosh, seriously.

830
00:51:36,879 --> 00:51:39,009
Keep walking. Why are you staring at me?

831
00:51:39,979 --> 00:51:41,179
Go! What do you want?

832
00:51:43,909 --> 00:51:46,079
Why do you keep looking at me? Just go.

833
00:52:00,609 --> 00:52:02,679
Gosh. Kim Bok Joo, you're too much.

834
00:52:03,009 --> 00:52:04,009
What?

835
00:52:04,009 --> 00:52:05,739
Do you know how uncool you are right now?

836
00:52:05,879 --> 00:52:07,739
Why are you being all awkward with me?

837
00:52:09,179 --> 00:52:11,709
What are you talking about? I'm not being awkward at all.

838
00:52:13,279 --> 00:52:15,579
What do I expect? You've probably never had a guy confess to you.

839
00:52:15,809 --> 00:52:18,609
Try to stop being so awkward. Be natural.

840
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:23,409
I'm being so natural. Blame your unnatural thoughts.

841
00:52:28,609 --> 00:52:30,939
- Hey, Nan Hee. - Bok Joo.

842
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:34,109
I almost died from a heart attack earlier.

843
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:37,179
My heart is still pumping so fast. I'm so scared.

844
00:52:37,309 --> 00:52:40,209
I just saw a ghost.

845
00:52:40,739 --> 00:52:42,309
I can't explain it over the phone.

846
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:45,339
I'd be less scared if you were here.

847
00:52:45,339 --> 00:52:47,809
- Come back soon. I'm terrified. - Hey.

848
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:51,279
All right. I'll go home first and head over there. Okay.

849
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:54,979
- Do your friends need you? - Yes.

850
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:58,009
Nan Hee said she saw a ghost or something. Who knows what happened?

851
00:52:58,339 --> 00:52:59,839
I should hurry, though. See you.

852
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:01,809
Hey, I'll walk you home.

853
00:53:02,139 --> 00:53:04,109
It's fine. It's right there. Just get going.

854
00:53:09,079 --> 00:53:11,009
She sure loves her friends.

855
00:53:11,239 --> 00:53:13,009
She's so loyal to her friends.

856
00:53:16,739 --> 00:53:18,439
She rejected me just as I expected.

857
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:20,679
It's all that weasel's fault.

858
00:53:24,909 --> 00:53:25,979
What's this?

859
00:53:29,979 --> 00:53:31,209
Is this Bok Joo's?

860
00:53:39,539 --> 00:53:40,839
It is her wallet.

861
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:47,439
Gosh, why does she carry so much cash?

862
00:53:48,909 --> 00:53:50,479
Oh, it's probably her pay from today.

863
00:53:52,579 --> 00:53:56,839
How can she be so clumsy about her hard-earned money?

864
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:03,509
Let's see.

865
00:54:03,609 --> 00:54:06,339
What else is in Bok Joo's wallet?

866
00:54:10,509 --> 00:54:12,979
Gosh, look at that face. Is she on a most-wanted list or what?

867
00:54:14,439 --> 00:54:17,839
From her eyes and nose...

868
00:54:18,679 --> 00:54:20,309
to her lips, everything is mediocre.

869
00:54:21,179 --> 00:54:24,979
But together, they look harmonious and cute.

870
00:54:30,979 --> 00:54:33,609
What is this? What on earth is this? Goodness gracious.

871
00:54:33,709 --> 00:54:34,779
Jeong Jae Yi.

872
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:36,079
Jeong Jae Yi, this...

873
00:54:45,339 --> 00:54:46,539
What's this now?

874
00:54:48,179 --> 00:54:50,279
"Things that I want to do".

875
00:54:51,779 --> 00:54:52,939
It must be her bucket list.

876
00:54:53,509 --> 00:54:55,839
"First. Studying at a library."

877
00:54:56,879 --> 00:54:58,179
You wish.

878
00:54:58,179 --> 00:55:00,279
You'll fall asleep in 5 minutes. I bet you 100 dollars.

879
00:55:00,909 --> 00:55:04,009
"Second. Learning how to play an instrument. Piano, maybe."

880
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:06,509
Piano? That I heard.

881
00:55:06,879 --> 00:55:08,579
"Third. Going to an amusement park on a weekday..."

882
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:10,239
"and riding five attractions."

883
00:55:11,209 --> 00:55:12,279
Right.

884
00:55:12,879 --> 00:55:15,809
On weekends, you waste so much time waiting in the lines.

885
00:55:18,439 --> 00:55:19,509
"Fourth".

886
00:55:21,479 --> 00:55:22,609
This is the most important one.

887
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:24,139
This is it. This is key.

888
00:55:26,539 --> 00:55:29,439
Her wishes are so humble even when it comes down to her boyfriend.

889
00:55:29,709 --> 00:55:31,809
Gosh, be quiet.

890
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:41,709
Okay. I obtained key information at a very important moment.

891
00:55:43,539 --> 00:55:44,979
The universe is helping me.

892
00:55:47,379 --> 00:55:50,279
I got out of the bathroom,

893
00:55:50,379 --> 00:55:53,479
then I saw something black and white passing by.

894
00:55:53,909 --> 00:55:55,879
I took a look at it again...

895
00:55:55,939 --> 00:55:57,709
and saw that her hair was let loose and unkempt.

896
00:55:57,709 --> 00:55:59,679
You know those white nightdresses, right?

897
00:56:05,439 --> 00:56:07,339
Then she went back into the washroom.

898
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:09,779
I was seriously so scared.

899
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:13,739
I would've wet my pants if I hadn't relieved myself already.

900
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:17,539
Yes. And you would've become a legend...

901
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:19,039
as a girl who wet her pants because of a ghost.

902
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:22,209
You fool. I like you.

903
00:56:23,809 --> 00:56:26,809
Isn't it so scary? Doesn't it give you goose bumps?

904
00:56:26,939 --> 00:56:29,109
I can't believe it, no matter how many times I hear the story.

905
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:31,109
I don't believe in ghosts.

906
00:56:31,579 --> 00:56:34,809
But I'm glad that the incident helped us get together like this.

907
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:37,539
When will you return to training, Bok Joo?

908
00:56:38,479 --> 00:56:39,479
What?

909
00:56:40,109 --> 00:56:41,639
Oh, yes.

910
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:44,039
Come back soon, Bok Joo.

911
00:56:44,339 --> 00:56:46,139
I need you to knock out that ghost.

912
00:56:46,139 --> 00:56:50,039
Right. Only Bok Joo is strong and fearless enough to catch that ghost.

913
00:56:51,139 --> 00:56:52,509
Why is your face so red by the way?

914
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:54,309
- Do you have a fever? - What?

915
00:56:54,509 --> 00:56:56,779
No. Why? I don't have a fever.

916
00:56:56,979 --> 00:56:58,979
You're right. Her face is beet red.

917
00:56:59,209 --> 00:57:02,009
It's probably because I was out in the cold. I feel fine.

918
00:57:15,439 --> 00:57:17,879
Oh, no. Keep Nan Hee safe.

919
00:57:23,079 --> 00:57:24,609
Darn it.

920
00:58:18,839 --> 00:58:20,439
Who... Who are you?

921
00:58:36,109 --> 00:58:37,109
(We thank Ji Soo for his guest appearance.)

922
00:58:44,779 --> 00:58:45,779
(Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo)

923
00:58:45,779 --> 00:58:47,739
Hey, why did you insist on meeting here?

924
00:58:47,739 --> 00:58:49,839
I have to pick up my girlfriend from her place, of course.

925
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:50,879
Is someone else coming?

926
00:58:50,879 --> 00:58:52,879
Joon Hyung!

927
00:58:52,979 --> 00:58:54,879
You're really something.

928
00:58:55,039 --> 00:58:56,539
It's cold. Use what you can.

929
00:58:56,709 --> 00:58:58,139
What is it? Is your heart fluttering?

930
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:01,209
I have to go to the hospital now. My dad was getting dialysis and...

931
00:59:01,409 --> 00:59:02,709
How have you been, Jae Yi?

932
00:59:02,709 --> 00:59:04,079
You haven't changed at all.

933
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:05,509
Do you still have feelings for Hwan Hee?

934
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:07,839
Where are you now? Can we meet up for a few minutes?

935
00:59:08,009 --> 00:59:09,239
Why? Do you have something to tell me?

936
00:59:09,539 --> 00:59:10,779
Joon Hyung.
