 SUBTITLES BY VIU N SYNC BY SA143 

2
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,510
Chubs, what are you doing here?

3
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,410
Why do you...

4
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,610
look like that?

5
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,450
- Why? - Joon Hyung.

6
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,580
What brings you here without calling me?

7
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,380
Hey, Jae Yi.

8
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,080
- Jae Yi? - I was just in the neighborhood.

9
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,750
I stopped by to eat with you.

10
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,610
Do you know each other?

11
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,150
- We went to the same... - Elementary school.

12
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,220
We attended the same elementary school.

13
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,980
Joon Hyung, I haven't seen you in so long.

14
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,050
I can't believe that we met again.

15
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,610
We haven't seen each other for 10 years, right?

16
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,220
You still recognized me.

17
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,080
It's a small world after all.

18
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,150
She's the cellist...

19
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,410
I mentioned to you before.

20
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,210
That was Bok Joo.

21
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,850
A cellist?

22
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,450
She's a cellist?

23
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,280
Yes.

24
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,310
Your major is playing the cello?

25
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,180
You were gifted in music since elementary school.

26
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,410
She's also a great singer.

27
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,710
She is?

28
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,480
Am I?

29
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,950
You must have been very close to remember such details.

30
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,150
Of course, we were best friends.

31
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,710
It's great to see you again, Bok Joo.

32
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,780
We'll have a great time together.

33
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,780
- Don't you think? - Right.

34
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,880
It's good to see you again.

35
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,550
I can't believe that you met each other again.

36
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,780
There must be a strong connection between us, Bok Joo.

37
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,280
You went to the same elementary school with my brother.

38
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,780
How do you play the cello so well?

39
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,350
She's also very strong.

40
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,650
A cellist is...

41
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,910
- as strong as a weightlifter. - I like classical music, too.

42
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,280
This must be a dream.

43
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,880
Such a thing can't be possible.

44
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,150
Why?

45
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,280
They don't even take after one another.

46
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,750
This is so absurd!

47
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,180
Hey.

48
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,980
Cellist Kim Bok Joo.

49
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,010
Wait for me.

50
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,180
I think we're going to the same destination.

51
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,310
(Episode 5, I'm Happy Because I'm a Woman)

52
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,350
You're a cellist?

53
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,180
After all, your arms are more fit for being a cellist...

54
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,510
than a violin or a flute player.

55
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,280
You understand exactly what the best thing is for you.

56
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,380
Stop acting like a know-it-all.

57
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,310
Hey, are you upset with me?

58
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,380
Are you calling me a know-it-all when I covered up for you?

59
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,980
How could you call me that?

60
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,080
Is he really your brother?

61
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,510
Of course we're brothers.

62
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,380
Since when have you been going there?

63
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,110
If you went there simply to lose weight,

64
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,510
you wouldn't lie about being a cellist.

65
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,080
It means that you had an ulterior motive.

66
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,920
Have you...

67
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,710
fallen in love with my brother?

68
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,010
Isn't that why you go there?

69
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,050
No way.

70
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,110
You're so creative, aren't you?

71
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,550
Even if I fell in love with him,

72
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,550
I wouldn't go there by paying so much money.

73
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,210
Then why do you go there by paying so much money?

74
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,920
Weightlifter Bok Joo?

75
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,210
That's because... Gosh, there's a mayfly.

76
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,350
You've matured a lot, Chubs.

77
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,310
You're willing to go far for a man.

78
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,510
Wouldn't you be in trouble if other weightlifters find out?

79
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,750
A weightlifter falls in love...

80
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,180
with a doctor at a weight clinic.

81
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,050
Oh, my goodness.

82
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,750
Hey!

83
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,920
You'll keep it a secret, won't you?

84
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,080
Of course I will.

85
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,510
Announcing it won't do me any good.

86
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,750
You thought I'd keep quiet?

87
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,110
It's unnecessary for me to keep it a secret.

88
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,780
I'll decide...

89
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,650
depending on how you behave.

90
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,010
Come on, what do you mean by that?

91
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,080
Why you...

92
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,510
Are you getting angry at me?

93
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,510
No, I just have a loud voice.

94
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,950
Maybe that's why I sounded angry.

95
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,110
No, I think you're angry at me.

96
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,350
No, I'm not.

97
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,180
I'm getting upset.

98
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,110
I'm not angry at you.

99
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,250
I'm really not.

100
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,980
Let me think about it.

101
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,150
Think about what? I'm not angry.

102
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,380
I'm leaving.

103
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,750
I'm not angry at you. Come on.

104
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,910
Gosh, I'm sorry!

105
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,950
My goodness.

106
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,650
I can't believe it.

107
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,010
Why did she fall in love with my brother of all people?

108
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,950
Gosh.

109
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,510
Goodness.

110
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,380
Why is he the brother of Joon Hyung?

111
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,050
Awesome, it's fish cutlet.

112
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,250
- Goodness. - Hey.

113
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,850
Be careful when you sit.

114
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,580
I'm fine.

115
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,880
No, you're not. You should be careful.

116
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,480
Shouldn't she carry a cushion with her?

117
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,680
That would make it too obvious.

118
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,510
Okay, you're exempted from eating a lot...

119
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,580
for a while.

120
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,710
- Our friendship is awesome. - Awesome.

121
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,710
Awesome.

122
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,650
It's very good to see you.

123
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,280
Did you sleep well last night?

124
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,010
I'm done. See you later.

125
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,780
No way. You just started eating.

126
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,210
Come on, we're colleagues. Why are you acting like this?

127
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,510
Sit back down.

128
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:33,850
What are you doing? Take a seat.

129
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,550
It's not like we're strangers. Come and sit down.

130
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,150
Please excuse me.

131
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,850
Why do my hands feel weak today?

132
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,280
Chubs, do it for me.

133
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,750
What?

134
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,910
Cut it for me.

135
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,650
Don't make it too thin.

136
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,650
I'm sorry, but can you get me some water, too?

137
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,110
Make it half cold and half hot.

138
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,280
Joon Hyung, why can't you do it yourself?

139
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,910
- I'll get it for you. - It's okay.

140
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,280
I'll get it.

141
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,110
I was thirsty myself anyway.

142
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,310
Make it 6 to 4 ratio.

143
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,410
It's sweet.

144
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,680
The water tastes especially sweet today.

145
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,850
What's going on between you and Joon Hyung?

146
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,550
What are you talking about?

147
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,580
Then why are you being obedient to him?

148
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,950
Didn't you hate him?

149
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,280
You wouldn't get water even for us. Something is definitely strange.

150
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,610
What are you talking about?

151
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,780
It wasn't such a big deal.

152
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,450
I realized that he isn't a bad person after all.

153
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,250
He's a bit immature,

154
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,780
but I must overlook him because we're colleagues.

155
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,880
You should have overlooked him a long time ago.

156
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,020
What made you change your mind...

157
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,910
- so suddenly? - I know.

158
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,210
Are you sure that there's nothing between you two?

159
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,210
No way.

160
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,210
It's not because I like him...

161
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,180
or because he knows some secret about me.

162
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,880
You guys are too sensitive.

163
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:15,050
My beautiful skin will be damaged again the day after tomorrow.

164
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,380
I don't know if I'd call your skin beautiful,

165
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,780
but I don't want to compete, either.

166
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,650
A competition is still necessary.

167
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,280
This is the only event that makes us proud.

168
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,350
That's true. If we win, we'll get a big dinner, right?

169
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,210
- Yes. Of course. - Well...

170
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,150
Guys. I should take off. I need to go to the hospital.

171
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,180
Okay.

172
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,780
If anyone asks about you, we'll make up a story.

173
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,450
I should get going. Thank you, guys.

174
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,520
Be careful.

175
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,520
See you later.

176
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,910
She seems so uncomfortable.

177
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,250
- It's hard to watch. - Is it?

178
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,980
It's 21.27 seconds. You stick out your head too much. Keep it down.

179
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,710
Go.

180
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,180
- Come on. - I'm tired.

181
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,150
Now, go. That's right. Keep going.

182
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,450
Okay. Good.

183
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,980
If I go to the dormitory, Ki Seok would know.

184
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,410
Chubs...

185
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,050
I can see where she's headed to.

186
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,150
Okay. Kim Bok Joo. I choose you.

187
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,680
You're maintaining your weight, but it's not decreasing.

188
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,650
It's not easy to lose weight in a healthy way, right?

189
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,710
No, it's not.

190
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,180
But I often do sit-ups.

191
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,650
You're doing good.

192
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,010
Let's not get ahead of ourselves and be greedy.

193
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,850
By the way, I guess you haven't changed since you were little.

194
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,050
- Excuse me? - Joon Hyung recognized you at once.

195
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,110
- He has changed a lot, right? - Yes.

196
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,080
I didn't recognize him at first.

197
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,950
I suppose. He got taller, and his personality has changed.

198
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,650
He was quite reversed when he was little.

199
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,850
That's right. Gosh.

200
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,450
He's so sly now. He keeps messing with me.

201
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,780
I wish I could punch him...

202
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,450
You saw him only for a minute. How did you figure out all that?

203
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,510
It's amazing.

204
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,180
It was only for a minute,

205
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,110
but he's so much different from before.

206
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:51,210
You're right. He's changed a lot.

207
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,950
Instead, he got so handsome.

208
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,350
Well... I'm not sure about that.

209
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,350
Why not? Everybody says he's more handsome than me.

210
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,150
No, he's not.

211
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,880
You're a million times more handsome than he is.

212
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,380
I'm flattered that you think so,

213
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:14,110
but I can't really jump up and down with joy. I'll lose my face.

214
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,310
You're really a million times more handsome.

215
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,110
Really?

216
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:21,910
Let me see.

217
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,010
Let's begin your treatment.

218
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,180
Do we have more patients?

219
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,780
Ms. Joo Hye Jeong changed her appointment to tomorrow.

220
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,950
Is that so? Let's finish up, then.

221
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,580
- Really? - Hi, Brother.

222
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,550
What are you doing here? You come here so often these days.

223
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,550
So? Aren't you happy to see me? Should I just go?

224
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,710
I am happy to see you.

225
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,550
You still owe me a dinner.

226
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,480
- You didn't buy me one before. - Goodness.

227
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,580
Like someone said, you're sly.

228
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,010
Who? Who said I'm sly? Who is it?

229
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,980
Who is it? Who?

230
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,280
Hello, there.

231
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,480
I didn't expect to see you here.

232
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,910
Hello.

233
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,150
I'm having dinner with Jae Yi. You should come, too.

234
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,850
You don't skip meals to lose weight, right?

235
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,410
Sure. You should come. We can go to a buffet.

236
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,010
No. I have plans.

237
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,080
Really? Let's eat by ourselves, then.

238
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,510
I should have a nice chat with my brother.

239
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,780
I have so many things to tell him.

240
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,110
Where are we eating?

241
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,780
Bok Joo. Are you seeing this?

242
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,110
Here.

243
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,310
Do you want this?

244
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,550
He's so sweet.

245
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,550
It's seasoned konjac.

246
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,980
It has much fiber, but it's low in calories.

247
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,050
Don't worry and eat.

248
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,950
Thank you.

249
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,110
Gosh, that's...

250
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,510
You're such a sweet guy, Jae Yi.

251
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,150
This is why you're so popular among girls.

252
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,650
Gosh, Bok Joo. Be careful.

253
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,350
I feel bad to watch you only eat vegetables trying to lose weight.

254
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,550
To lift weights... No, barbells...

255
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,580
I mean to lift a cello, you should be strong.

256
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,610
Thank you so much for your concern.

257
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,110
It's hard to be on a diet while studying music, right?

258
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,450
No, it's fine.

259
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,780
Sure. Some people are gifted with strength.

260
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,910
Look at her arms.

261
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,310
Gosh. With arms like this, you'd be a great athlete.

262
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,480
For example, something like this.

263
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,380
Lifting 130kg!

264
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,050
- No. I don't like sports. - Why not?

265
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,550
You like soccer. Messi, in particular.

266
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,480
- Messi? - She...

267
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,980
asked me if I liked Messi when she first came to my clinic.

268
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,250
She seemed to be a big fan of his.

269
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,750
Do you like Messi?

270
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,650
That's right. I'm a big fan of Messi's.

271
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,210
You're a fan of Messi's, too.

272
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,450
That's right. Did you see him score yesterday?

273
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,310
Gosh. He made a free kick and scored.

274
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,910
From an angle like this, the ball...

275
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,880
Excuse me.

276
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,180
No, I'm not busy. Yes.

277
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,750
Hey.

278
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,980
Do you and your friends ask everyone if they like Messi?

279
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,980
Is Messi aware of this terrible fact?

280
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,150
Stop it.

281
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,250
- How long are you going to do this? - Do what?

282
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,220
- What am I doing? - Cut it out.

283
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,220
You know what I mean. If I could just...

284
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,350
Drink some water. You'll get indigestion.

285
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,410
I'm sorry.

286
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,780
It was my close friend. Oh, the goal.

287
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,980
It was fantastic. Did you see it?

288
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,380
No, I watched weightlifting last night.

289
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,950
Why would you watch weightlifting?

290
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,680
On the game last night,

291
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,180
they lifted weights like this.

292
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,680
Please eat.

293
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,880
Get in, Joon Hyung. You, too, Bok Joo.

294
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,010
Okay. Thank you.

295
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,380
I'll give you two a ride. Get in.

296
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,450
Wait.

297
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,450
Joon Hyung and I will stay and talk for a while.

298
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,850
Talk about what? We've been talking all along.

299
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,110
It's been 10 years. We have a lot to talk about.

300
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,180
Let's catch up, shall we?

301
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:17,180
That's right. You should spend some time together.

302
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,550
You still have time until the roll call.

303
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,250
I'll get going, then. I'll see you later at the clinic.

304
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,780
- See you later. - Take good care of her.

305
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,480
Jae Yi. I should go with you. Jae Yi.

306
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,410
Take me with you. Jae Yi.

307
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,380
Goodbye. Please drive safely.

308
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:38,110
Do you want me to die? Jae Yi. Take me with you.

309
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,010
You'd better follow me quietly.

310
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,450
Let's not make a scene.

311
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,780
Why are you lowering your voice? It's scary.

312
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,080
Why are we here?

313
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,450
- Joon Hyung. - Don't lower your voice.

314
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,180
You're scaring me.

315
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,950
You're not...

316
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,580
going to kill me...

317
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,280
and bury me, right?

318
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,350
Let's make a deal.

319
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,280
- What deal? - I'm always on the jig...

320
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,550
because you might say something to someone.

321
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,050
I can't live like this. It will kill me soon.

322
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,450
I'll let you have a big one, and we'll call it a day.

323
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,150
A big one?

324
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,280
What do you mean by that?

325
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,220
You should decide that.

326
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,310
Here. Do you want to punch me?

327
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,280
Gosh, you startled me.

328
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:58,510
If you're going to shove your face to mine, give me a warning first.

329
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,280
Also, I'm not a thug.

330
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,220
What do you want, then? Money?

331
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,880
How much money will you give me?

332
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,410
I'm a little short on cash right now,

333
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,080
but I'll try to raise some.

334
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:17,150
How much will it take to keep you silent?

335
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,610
I'm not sure.

336
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:27,010
I'm quite enjoying knowing your weakness.

337
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,880
But...

338
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,720
at the moment,

339
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,610
I'm not really in need of money.

340
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,910
But if I punch you,

341
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,780
I'll just end up with a sore fist.

342
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,950
So?

343
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,280
Okay.

344
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,350
Let's think about it carefully.

345
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:55,950
I only have one chance,

346
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,580
so I can't waste it.

347
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,980
Aren't you coming? We'll be late for the evening roll call.

348
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,350
Let's go.

349
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,450
A deal.

350
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,180
How did she even come up with that?

351
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,180
That girl, Bok Joo, is such a lunatic.

352
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,950
Hey, hey.

353
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,150
Hey.

354
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,010
- Did you see Ki Seok? - No, I didn't.

355
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,580
- Why? Did he say he'll kill me? - Yes.

356
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,110
Also...

357
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,720
There's more?

358
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,450
He said he'll make you lift a big bag of rice.

359
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,010
That's what everyone hates the most at the track meet.

360
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:49,310
No one wants to do it, so that jerk put your name down for it.

361
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,610
It's what you're getting for not showing up.

362
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,780
You should've stopped him, you idiot.

363
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,780
How exactly was I supposed to do it?

364
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,750
I have no power whatsoever.

365
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,510
How can I stop that jerk?

366
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,610
Just accept it, okay?

367
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,610
It won't look cool, but you should just do it and get it over with.

368
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,310
I don't care. I'm going to disappear that day.

369
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,150
How will you handle the consequences?

370
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,980
It's not like that sociopath will become fond of me after that.

371
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,780
I'd much rather get scolded...

372
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,380
and punished later.

373
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,250
I'm going to run away,

374
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,550
so you better keep your mouth shut about it. Are we clear?

375
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,310
I don't even know any more. Do whatever you want.

376
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,410
What are you going to be doing?

377
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,850
I've been assigned with something. Cheer...

378
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,380
- What? - Cheer... Cheer...

379
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,310
Stop mumbling, will you?

380
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,410
Cheerleading. Cheerleading, you punk.

381
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,750
I'll be a cheerleader.

382
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:54,780
Jeong Joon Hyung.

383
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,250
You sneaked out again yesterday.

384
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,750
I guess you're going to consider the duck walk as part of the training.

385
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,510
Something came up at home.

386
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,280
Right.

387
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,110
I should refrain from giving you any muscle-building punishment.

388
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,650
The pool water will start getting cold now.

389
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,780
Just clean the pool, you idiot.

390
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,780
Darn it.

391
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,650
Are you really going to be okay?

392
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,210
You won't be able to handle Ki Seok if he loses it.

393
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,950
I don't even know. I'll worry about it when I have to. My head hurts.

394
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,650
How's your cheerleading practice going?

395
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,180
It's going all right.

396
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,850
I need to pick a color for my uniform.

397
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:39,580
Shall I go for silver or pretty purple?

398
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,780
Hey.

399
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,380
You seem to be enjoying it.

400
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,750
What are you talking about? I'm totally enjoying it.

401
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,550
I've never been so focused in my entire life.

402
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,410
You idiot.

403
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,110
What's your problem?

404
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,650
Did you have good training?

405
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,650
I've been waiting for you to grab pizza with you.

406
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,710
You like wood-fired pizza.

407
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,780
I found a good place.

408
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,050
- Have a great time. - Hey.

409
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,480
Hey.

410
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,610
Why are you being like this, seriously?

411
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,950
I want to try my best.

412
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:17,880
Just get used to it.

413
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,080
Relationships aren't like sports.

414
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,380
Effort does not guarantee success.

415
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,980
I still want to give my all and see if it makes a difference.

416
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,510
I can only give up when I know that it's absolutely not possible.

417
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:30,750
I was fine when I was in Taereung, but seeing you made me realize...

418
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,680
that I can't give up.

419
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:35,780
You're the only thing...

420
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,180
I can hold onto now.

421
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,910
Learn to stand on your own two feet.

422
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,450
Everyone lives his or her own life.

423
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:46,680
You can't expect anyone...

424
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,580
to solve your problem.

425
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,650
I don't want to go for pizza with you.

426
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,080
Gosh, your hair.

427
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,750
I told you that you have to dry your hair properly.

428
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,780
What are you going to do if you catch a cold?

429
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,080
I was in a rush because of someone.

430
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,550
- Let's go for pizza. - What?

431
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,450
I want to watch you eat.

432
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,910
Then I'm going to watch you watching me eat.

433
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,680
What?

434
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,280
What was that about?

435
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,350
Gosh, seriously!

436
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:27,610
Wait up!

437
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,010
Okay.

438
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,510
I'll accept my punishment.

439
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,210
I'll do whatever you think I deserve...

440
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,480
if it means we can get back together.

441
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,450
You guys know that the track meet is finally happening tomorrow, right?

442
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,680
- Yes! - Yes!

443
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,410
What's our slogan, guys?

444
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,550
"The Best Team with the Best Teamwork".

445
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,480
Let's flaunt our strong teamwork...

446
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,850
and show everyone that the track meet is our day.

447
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,680
Let's prove it to everyone once again.

448
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,010
- Okay! - Okay!

449
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,650
- Attention. - Professor.

450
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,210
Why is it our day?

451
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,210
Ye Bin, that's a great question.

452
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,650
You freshmen probably don't know yet.

453
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,750
Since the very first track meet,

454
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,750
our weightlifting team has always won...

455
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,610
the first place due to our remarkable strength,

456
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,250
endurance, and perseverance.

457
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,310
It goes all the way back to 1991...

458
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,750
- when I was a freshman... - Professor.

459
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,850
You said you have a meeting in the afternoon.

460
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,780
Right, I forgot.

461
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,610
I'll tell you guys next time.

462
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,880
You're dismissed.

463
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,410
Attention. Bow.

464
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,850
- Thank you! - Thank you!

465
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,180
- We're going to teach you a lesson. - You better watch out.

466
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:45,710
Hey.

467
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,310
I overheard the conversation between Professor Yoon and Coach Choi.

468
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,050
Woon Gi is changing his weight class.

469
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,910
Why would he do that all of a sudden?

470
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,550
It's obviously a strategy.

471
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,780
Woon Gi is strong, so if he bulks up a little,

472
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,010
he can surely aim for that class as well.

473
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,180
Also, you two are in the same weight class now.

474
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,880
Then I'd be grateful.

475
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,910
So he wasn't practicing for the semi-professional match?

476
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,750
- I guess not. - I feel so apologetic suddenly.

477
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,950
(Weightlifting Department)

478
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,510
- Thank you for today. - Bye, guys.

479
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:44,610
Thanks.

480
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,180
Hey.

481
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,050
Why would you bulk up just before graduation?

482
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:53,150
Do you feel that responsible as a team leader?

483
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,750
I just want to do it.

484
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,580
I want to test my limits.

485
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,050
Your limits? Whatever.

486
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,350
It could ruin your health.

487
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,550
Hey, learn to put yourself first.

488
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:07,750
Don't go overboard for us. Think about yourself first.

489
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,280
See you.

490
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,410
See you tomorrow.

491
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:17,750
All right.

492
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:30,680
Joon Hyung.

493
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,080
Shall we wrap the weight training...

494
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,250
and go to play a game for an hour?

495
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,110
Forget it. I don't want to.

496
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:39,280
Hey, our fingers need exercise, too.

497
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,050
Otherwise, I'll tell Ki Seok that you won't show up tomorrow.

498
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,780
Do whatever you want. You jerk.

499
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,180
Come on, Joon Hyung. Let's go, please!

500
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:03,950
He's supposed to be my friend,

501
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,680
but he never cooperates.

502
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,850
Did you have a good meal?

503
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,650
I'm practicing right now.

504
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:18,580
What means happiness for me?

505
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,250
Getting into the national team?

506
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:23,650
Are you all right?

507
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,850
Give me your arm.

508
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,780
- That feels nice. - You've been coming here every day.

509
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,950
Did you miss me that much?

510
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,780
My gosh, you read my mind.

511
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,080
I think you got a message.

512
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,310
(Song Si Ho)

513
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,310
- I don't need to check it. - It must be from a girl.

514
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,980
Don't be too difficult.

515
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,980
You'll lose her if you play hard to get.

516
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,550
Don't worry about me. Worry about yourself first.

517
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,310
What do you mean?

518
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,910
You can't afford to waste your time like this.

519
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,780
Get your act together. Jae Yi is so popular these days.

520
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:03,280
Hey, what are you talking about? We're just friends.

521
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,750
What do you mean, though?

522
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,780
He's popular?

523
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,680
Is he really seeing someone now?

524
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,250
I guess it still bothers you.

525
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,480
I'm not bothered by it.

526
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,310
I'm just curious.

527
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,550
Just get ready to turn on your signal.

528
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,750
If you stall, you may miss your chance to change lanes.

529
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,450
There must be someone in Jae Yi's life.

530
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:29,610
Is it that gorgeous model who comes to his clinic?

531
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,010
A model? Who do you mean?

532
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,650
- You're working hard. - Yes.

533
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,010
My abs don't seem very strong these days.

534
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,580
It's good to see you working so hard.

535
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,050
By the way,

536
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,910
have you seen Joon Hyung today?

537
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,850
No.

538
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,080
Si Ho, I'm sorry,

539
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,180
but could you not mention him for a while?

540
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,080
I'm going through a hard time because of him.

541
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,450
Why?

542
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:18,450
Something is making me feel uncomfortable. Don't ask any more.

543
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,910
(Infirmary)

544
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:42,350
- Hello, don't I look pretty today? - Yes, you do.

545
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,380
I'm the queen of Haneol Sport University today.

546
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,450
- Go on. - Bye.

00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,510
(Gymnastics Team)

549
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:04,280
(Weightlifting Team)

550
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,850
It looks good on you.

551
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:08,750
Thank you for the compliment.

552
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,680
- Where's Joon Hyung? - Joon Hyung?

553
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,880
Actually, it's a secret.

554
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,180
He ran away because he didn't want to lift a big bag of rice.

555
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,080
Where did he go?

556
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,580
Players, please step forward.

557
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,910
- Gymnasts! - Gymnasts!

558
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,780
All of you are doomed today.

559
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,750
We'll destroy all of you.

560
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,480
I'll attack only one person.

561
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,650
Get ready, set, go.

562
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:30,650
- Let's go. - Go, Bok Joo.

563
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:31,780
You can do it.

564
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:03,310
(Swimming Team)

565
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,050
- That's amazing. - Everyone.

566
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,610
Next up is lifting bags of rice.

567
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,780
Those of you who are playing, step forward.

568
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,080
(List of participants)

569
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,080
Jeong Joon Hyung. Joon Hyung.

570
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,350
- Tae Kwon. - Yes?

571
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,180
Where did Joon Hyung go this time?

572
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,980
I'm not sure. He was here a moment ago.

573
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,350
Did he go to use the bathroom?

574
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:28,950
Are you kidding with me? Bring him here right now.

575
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:30,510
Now!

576
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,350
Are you still playing games?

577
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:37,350
- What's going on? - The places you go are obvious.

578
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:40,780
You're either at the swimming pool, basketball court or cyber cafe.

579
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,780
I don't like track meets, either.

580
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,050
I didn't know that you were a good detective.

581
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,850
Were you busy yesterday? You didn't read my messages.

582
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,850
No, I didn't read them even though I wasn't busy.

583
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,480
(Tae Kwon)

584
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,250
Answer the phone, you punk.

585
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,680
I didn't do anything bad to you.

586
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,580
How can I find him if he's determined to hide?

587
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:20,010
He finds it easy to use me. I should tell on him.

588
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,650
Did I scare you? I'm sorry. I was just too hot.

589
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:27,280
Have you seen Joon Hyung?

590
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,310
No, I haven't. What's wrong?

591
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,880
- It's nothing. Take care. - Okay.

592
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,710
- Hello, Sir. - Tae Kwon!

593
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,480
Haven't you found Joon Hyung yet?

594
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,050
I'm still looking for him, but I don't think he's on campus.

595
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,120
Are you kidding me?

596
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:48,950
Find him in five minutes.

597
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:50,950
Do whatever you have to do to bring him.

598
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,980
If he doesn't show up, both of you are doomed.

599
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,780
Ki Seok?

600
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,780
Ki Seok? You punk.

601
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:02,280
I'm not Joon Hyung's partner in crime.

602
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,410
Why does he always blame me for his fault?

603
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,010
I'm not the one who's skipping it.

604
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,080
By the way,

605
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,780
did Joon Hyung do something wrong?

606
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:14,710
He ran away because he didn't want to lift bags of rice.

607
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,510
I don't think it'll just end with the usual punishment.

608
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,080
He's going to destroy us.

609
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,410
There's an old saying that one's partner can determine his life.

610
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:25,780
I completely empathize with that saying.

611
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,050
I shouldn't have been friends with him in the first place.

612
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:31,410
Are you saying that...

613
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,980
if Joon Hyung...

614
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,620
doesn't participate in the game of lifting bags of rice,

615
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:39,950
he'll be at the risk of being destroyed by his senior?

616
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,010
Is that right?

617
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,120
That's right.

618
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,010
Why is he calling me so much?

619
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,050
What?

620
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,450
I'm glad you answered. It's me.

621
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,120
Who is this?

622
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,150
Bok Joo?

623
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,620
I got your number from your friend. I think today's the day.

624
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,250
What do you mean?

625
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,010
Let's make that deal we talked about before.

626
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,910
- What? - Listen to me carefully.

627
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,410
I'm going to save you today.

628
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:32,380
In return, don't ever tease me again...

629
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,050
about my weakness, okay?

630
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,950
I'll take that as a yes.

631
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,310
Hey, Chubs. Bok Joo.

632
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,010
Bok Joo.

633
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:49,050
- Bok Joo? What's going on? - The phone is turned off...

634
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:52,850
Where are you going?

635
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,380
Am I sick?

636
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,980
Looking at those bags of rice makes me want to do something.

637
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:01,510
Guys, I think Hyung Chul is hungry again after seeing the bags of rice.

638
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:03,950
It's unfortunate.

639
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:07,310
If the weightlifting team could participate in this game,

640
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,710
- we'd be the winner. - Come on.

641
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,620
That would be unfair.

642
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,150
If the track and field team runs relay races and jumps hurdles,

643
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:17,450
the track meet would be a talent show.

644
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:19,010
That's true.

645
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:23,550
If the judo team defeats the swimming team,

646
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:26,050
we'll definitely be the winners.

647
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,080
Don't worry.

648
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,850
There's no way the swimming team is stronger than the judo team.

649
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,550
- Judo Team. - Let's go, Judo Team.

650
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:41,210
- Judo Team. - You can do it.

651
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:44,010
- Come on, let's go. - You can do it.

652
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:47,080
Participants from the swimming team, please step forward.

653
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:50,120
Swimming Team, are you giving up already?

654
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,510
Anyone who's strong should step forward.

655
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,620
I'm here. I'm right here.

656
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:59,310
Here I am.

657
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,250
I'm sorry,

658
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,950
but the person who was supposed to participate is sick.

659
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,280
Instead of him,

660
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:08,650
can someone else play?

661
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,580
- Someone else? - Who?

662
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,050
What are you talking about? Where on earth is Joon Hyung?

663
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,180
I couldn't find him.

664
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,780
Isn't it more important to win?

665
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,850
- Hold him back. - Why you...

666
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:21,850
Here's the player...

667
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:25,880
who will represent the swimming team in lifting bags of rice.

668
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,950
(Gymnastics Team)

669
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:27,980
(Swimming Team)

670
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:52,450
Who is that?

671
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,550
All right, this player...

672
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,880
will participate in place of Joon Hyung...

673
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:02,050
and represent the swimming team.

674
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:05,150
- What are you doing? Get back here. - You've lost your mind.

675
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,050
Give her a round of applause.

676
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,450
- What's wrong with her? - I don't know, but she's crazy.

677
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,620
Did you know about this?

678
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,210
We're running late, so we'll allow her to participate.

679
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:25,350
For the first round, we'll start with 40kg!

680
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,480
That's so easy. I'm sure she can lift 40kg with one hand.

681
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,620
Are we allowed to do this?

682
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,050
- Nice! - Okay, great!

683
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,350
- Okay. - Did you guys see that?

684
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,750
- That was awesome. - My goodness.

685
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,010
This time, it's four bags.

686
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,410
Go!

687
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,280
- Oh, my! - Amazing!

688
00:40:48,280 --> 00:41:01,080
- Kim Bok Joo! - Kim Bok Joo!

689
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,850
- She did it. - Nicely done!

690
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,380
Let's move on to the final round.

691
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,910
They'll lift five bags this time. Go!

692
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,120
This is the last round.

693
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:22,380
- Kim Bok Joo. - Kim Bok Joo.

694
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,050
- Kim Bok Joo! - My goodness.

695
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,880
- Kim Bok Joo! - Go, weightlifting team!

696
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,480
- Kim Bok Joo! - Kim Bok Joo!

697
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,450
- Oh, no! - No!

698
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:34,750
- He lost. - Hey!

699
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:41,080
What was he doing, seriously?

700
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,550
We got the second place because of you!

701
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,380
- Gosh, I'm so angry. - Bok Joo!

702
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,580
Bok Joo.

703
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,910
Hey, Bok Joo!

704
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,580
- Good work! - You were amazing!

705
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:54,350
- We need better teamwork. - We've never lost.

706
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:56,480
- Guys, it's okay. - It's too bad.

707
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,780
We got the second place.

708
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,250
Good work, everyone.

709
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:03,250
Winning the second place...

710
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:04,950
is good enough, of course.

711
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,150
We can't win the first place every time.

712
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:12,710
We should pat ourselves on the back for beating...

713
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,910
the judo team at the tug-of-war match.

714
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,780
Of course...

715
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:20,410
I'm very sad that our legacy as the strongest team was broken...

716
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,120
while I'm in charge of the team.

717
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,210
Not even two points.

718
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,010
One point would've been enough...

719
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,120
to make us the co-champion.

720
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,350
It's not the end of the world, though.

721
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:38,080
Process matters more than outcome.

722
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:40,880
I'm happy if you guys had fun.

723
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:42,550
Eat. Eat up.

724
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,410
Are you not going to eat, Professor?

725
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,250
I don't really have any appetite. I'm not going to eat anything!

726
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,580
Well, I mean...

727
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,880
Eat it and get some rest, okay?

728
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,910
Good work, everyone.

729
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:05,280
Don't forget to massage your muscles,

730
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:07,210
and don't be late tomorrow.

731
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:11,180
Gosh. Kim Bok Joo, that little...

732
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,480
Do they want us to eat this or not?

733
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,750
This isn't even much. Professor Yoon is so mean.

734
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,950
We were so close to winning, though. We lost by one point.

735
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:24,120
Exactly. You should've run faster.

736
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,010
We could've earned 5 points if you got into the top 3.

737
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:30,880
Why are you putting the blame on me?

738
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,450
What did they call her again? A helper? A rat?

739
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:35,780
If she didn't betray us,

740
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:37,580
the swimming team wouldn't have won.

741
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,910
You're right.

742
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,150
Bok Joo.

743
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:44,250
What on earth were you thinking?

744
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,250
I didn't know that this would be the outcome. I'm sorry.

745
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,650
You're a psycho if you did it expecting this outcome.

746
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:51,480
Hey, don't eat that burger.

747
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:54,050
Go to the swimming team and ask for one. Don't eat it!

748
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,880
That's enough, guys. What's done is done.

749
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,050
Bok Joo.

750
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,950
You should clean up everything after.

751
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:02,650
You should do that, right?

752
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,450
That's such a light punishment.

753
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:08,080
That's way too light of a punishment for a betrayer.

754
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,010
You're really something.

755
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,710
What are you looking at?

756
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:14,780
Get your act together, will you?

757
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:16,910
Dear me.

758
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:27,280
I'm sorry. I don't even know what to tell you.

759
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:29,310
Bok Joo.

760
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:32,210
You have a crush on Joon Hyung, don't you?

761
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:33,310
Hey.

762
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,980
What are you talking about?

763
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:37,180
Don't lie to my face.

764
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,180
You can't fool me.

765
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:42,310
That's the only plausible explanation.

766
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,550
A substitute? Whatever.

767
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:48,110
Why would you stand in for him and help the swimming team?

768
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:50,280
You obviously like him.

769
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:52,110
That's why you risked worsening...

770
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:54,480
the condition you have and lifted all of those bags.

771
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,710
I knew that something was up between the two of you.

772
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,880
Hey, Bok Joo.

773
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,380
- Is that really what happened? - Not at all!

774
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:02,610
I wish I could turn my heart inside out and show you.

775
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:05,080
- You're driving me crazy. - You're driving us crazy.

776
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,550
Then explain why you did what you did so that we can understand.

777
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:08,950
You got it all wrong.

778
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,610
- I don't like him. - You do like him. I can tell.

779
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,210
I can't believe you did that because of a guy.

780
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:16,510
How can you betray us?

781
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,350
I really...

782
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:22,280
That's really not what happened!

783
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:25,580
Hey, you should've stopped her.

784
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,910
How can you just let her do that?

785
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:29,410
She said she was indebted to you.

786
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:31,310
She wanted to do it so that she can call it even,

787
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:32,650
so I couldn't stop her.

788
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:34,880
Shut it, you fool. This puts her in such an awkward situation.

789
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,410
The weightlifting team lost because of her.

790
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:38,780
She has become a traitor to them!

791
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:42,050
It's just a track meet. Don't be so dramatic.

792
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:43,780
I'm just saying. You piece of...

793
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:44,980
Oh, there she is.

794
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:47,080
Girls, believe me.

795
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,510
That's really not what happened, okay?

796
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:50,110
- All right, we heard you. - I'll explain.

797
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:52,850
- We heard you. - Enough. We already figured it out.

798
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,450
Hey, no, no. It's not what you're thinking.

799
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:02,780
Let's talk.

800
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:05,250
- All right. Let go of me first. - Bok Joo...

801
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,380
Okay, but let go of me. I said, let go!

802
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:12,980
Goodness. Why is that jerk dragging Bok Joo?

803
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,610
Where is he taking her? Where?

804
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:15,850
It looks like we have a big problem.

805
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,610
What is this about? What do you want?

806
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:22,680
What on earth were you thinking?

807
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:24,910
I told you on the phone. We're even now.

808
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,950
I no longer want to worry about you exposing it,

809
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:29,280
and I'm done with being teased by you.

810
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,750
What's your problem? Shall I explain more?

811
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,450
You're insane if you go ahead and reveal my secret after this.

812
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:38,150
Be sure to keep your mouth shut from this moment on.

813
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,750
You better keep my secret safe.

814
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,210
What kind of person do you think I am?

815
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:43,710
Even if you think I'm thoughtless,

816
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,250
how can you assume that I'd tell your team members?

817
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:47,650
That's not what I meant.

818
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:49,680
Don't tell Doctor Jeong.

819
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:54,080
He's your brother. What if you let it slip?

820
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,150
I don't want him to think that I'm a liar,

821
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:01,480
so please don't tell him, okay?

822
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,710
Do you like him that much?

823
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:11,750
Why? What do you like about him?

824
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:12,780
Yes, I like him. What's the problem?

825
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:15,080
Am I not allowed to like a guy or what?

826
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:17,680
I don't even expect him to like me back.

827
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:20,180
I just want to see him and like him. Can't I even do that?

828
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,210
I'm sorry that I ended up falling for your brother.

829
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:35,980
So what do you think?

830
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:38,980
Bok Joo likes your friend, doesn't she?

831
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:42,880
Well, I'm not too sure. I can't really tell.

832
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:45,350
What are you saying exactly?

833
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:46,680
Well... I'm just...

834
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,210
I can be a little wishy-washy.

835
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:52,480
I'm just realizing that we don't even know each other's names...

836
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,380
even though we've met many times.

837
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,850
I'm Cho Tae Kwon from the swimming team.

838
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:01,480
I'm Jeong Nan Hee from the weightlifting team.

839
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,610
Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Seon Ok.

840
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,550
Nice you meet you both.

841
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:09,250
I'm so happy to get to know cool girls like you... First off,

842
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:12,610
I must apologize to you for the mishap caused by my foolish friend.

843
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:14,610
I'm happy we've become friends.

844
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:17,480
Don't you worry. We don't have any...

845
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,350
hard feelings towards you, Tae Kwon.

846
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:22,210
Your friend is the problem.

847
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:24,880
I think he's toying with Bok Joo's feelings.

848
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,450
It looks like he's leading her on.

849
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:30,850
Right. He can be like that.

850
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:32,650
He's a little full of himself,

851
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:34,780
and he plays games with people's emotions.

852
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:38,210
I told him numerous times that he'd end up being punished...

853
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:41,410
for his deeds, but he never listens to any of my advice.

854
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:42,410
Anyway,

855
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,350
I'll guide him to the best of my ability so that there's no problem.

856
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,080
You should.

857
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:50,850
I'm glad that we're on the same page.

858
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:53,850
This is a little awkward, though. Can we just talk casually?

859
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,250
Of course! By all means.

860
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:57,110
Talk to me however you want. I don't care.

861
00:48:57,610 --> 00:48:58,680
Okay, Tae Kwon.

862
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:00,780
- Great stuff, Nan Ok. - Nan...

863
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:01,950
I'm Nan Hee.

864
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:03,050
- Her name is Seon Ok. - Let's go.

865
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:04,280
Oh, right. Seon Ok.

866
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,680
What's going on? Did he reject her?

867
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:09,450
- Goodness! - Hey, Bok Joo!

868
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,580
Hey.

869
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:15,110
My goodness.

870
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:16,680
I was so nervous.

871
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:19,780
Why are they so scary? What took you so long?

872
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,710
Gosh, my legs are wobbly.

873
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:30,880
Drink up.

874
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:33,580
Drink away and forget everything.

875
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:35,480
Yes.

876
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:38,310
Dating a handsome guy would be too nerve-racking.

877
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:40,880
Enough! I told you that is not what's going on.

878
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,850
Right. There's no point in talking about what's already done.

879
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:45,680
Just forget about him!

880
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:48,180
Think whatever you want.

881
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:49,880
It doesn't even matter.

882
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,480
Hey, I'll hook you up with guys.

883
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,510
I know so many guys.

884
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:57,750
What do you think of him? He's in rowing.

885
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,280
I have my eyes on him, but I'll introduce you to him...

886
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,280
if he's your type.

887
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:05,480
Or... What was his name? Tae Kwon? What do you think of him?

888
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,750
He seems like a much easier target than Joon Hyung.

889
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,280
Bok Joo has standards, too. Don't be so ridiculous.

890
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,250
What do you mean?

891
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:15,110
I think he's cute. He'll be easy to deal with.

892
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:17,110
He's also pretty stylish and sweet.

893
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:19,650
Sure. You like all guys.

894
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:20,780
Go ahead and date everyone.

895
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:24,980
I miss him so much.

896
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,280
Hey, Bok Joo.

897
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,550
I feel so bad for her.

898
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,210
I miss him so much.

899
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:39,450
I miss him.

900
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:41,710
I really do.

901
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:49,480
I really miss him.

902
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:12,310
Listen.

903
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:15,680
Can I ask you something?

904
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,580
Sure. What is it?

905
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:20,280
Why did you...

906
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:24,310
lift the rice bags for Joon Hyung yesterday?

907
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:27,150
Oh, that.

908
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:30,150
I just...

909
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:32,610
had a reason. That's all I can say.

910
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:35,850
It's a personal matter. I'm sorry.

911
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:39,150
Is that so?

912
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:41,450
You're a secretive person, too.

913
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:52,380
I gave a ticket to Jae Yi as well. He'll sit next to you.

914
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,050
Act surprised. It's my gift.

915
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:57,510
(Symphony Orchestra)

916
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:18,510
Bok Joo. Why aren't you more excited? You like this.

917
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:21,550
I made you a good one. Here. Eat this.

918
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:24,050
It's so delicious.

919
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,710
It's good.

920
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:29,850
It was so fun.

921
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:33,850
The lounge looks like a marketplace. Don't you think?

922
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:37,410
They're sitting there like a bunch of old ladies.

923
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:40,110
- Gosh, I know. - Look at their posture.

924
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:41,380
Mind your own business.

925
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:44,210
We can eat or do whatever we want. It doesn't concern you.

926
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:46,210
Have pity on them.

927
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:48,880
Appetite is 1 of the 3 human desires,

928
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:50,980
but they can't help it.

929
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:53,610
Fine. I'm sure there're things you can't help, too.

930
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:54,910
Let's say we're even.

931
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,510
- Am I right, nuns? - They've never dated men.

932
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:00,850
- How faithful. - How dare you.

933
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:03,480
- Gosh, she startled me. - Fine. We'll go.

934
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,880
Goodness, what's wrong with her?

935
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:09,180
Words don't work on them. Only force does.

936
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:13,580
Should I go? Or not?

937
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:16,110
Should I just go?

938
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:21,510
He'll think it's strange if I sit next to him.

939
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:24,510
I don't have an outfit to wear for an orchestra.

940
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:27,510
Gosh, let's just forget about it.

941
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:32,910
Joon Hyung, Tae Kwon.

942
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,180
You're not wiping hard enough.

943
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:40,950
What? Does it hurt your pride that you're cleaning with the freshmen?

944
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,980
- Do you want to do it alone? - No!

945
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:46,610
We'll work harder!

946
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:49,450
All right. Work harder.

947
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:50,780
Okay.

948
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:01,080
Gosh, my arms hurt. Still, it was better than I expected.

949
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,180
If we hadn't won, it would've been much worse.

950
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,780
We owe it to your friend.

951
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:09,880
- Are you happy? - Of course I am.

952
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,980
By the way, does she really like you?

953
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,910
Her friends seem to think that way.

954
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:19,710
They're mistaken. She pines for someone else.

955
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:20,750
- Really? - Yes.

956
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,150
Speak of the devil. There they are.

957
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,910
I don't see your friend.

958
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:34,950
I'm sure she's busy acting graceful right now.

959
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:50,110
Oh, my. Dr. Jeong.

960
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:54,580
Bok Joo.

961
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,550
Are you here to for the orchestra?

962
00:54:57,850 --> 00:54:59,650
Yes. This is so unexpected.

963
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,850
Joon Hyung gave me a ticket.

964
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:05,150
I always wanted to hear this orchestra play.

965
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:08,210
Even my seat is next to yours. This almost looks like a set-up.

966
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:10,250
I know.

967
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:13,550
By the way, you look like a whole different person.

968
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:14,610
I almost didn't recognize you.

969
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:17,980
I feel a little uncomfortable,

970
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:20,750
but you should dress in accordance with the occasion.

971
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:23,280
- Please sit. - Okay.

972
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,010
- Did you see this pamphlet? - Thank you.

973
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:48,510
Do you play like that?

974
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:05,150
What did you think, Bok Joo? It was much better than I expected.

975
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:08,750
The ensemble of the string instruments were outstanding.

976
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:11,110
You major in cello. it must've been great.

977
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:16,050
That's right. They were very skillful.

978
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,110
Let me give you a ride home.

979
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,210
You don't have to.

980
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:23,580
Actually, that would be helpful.

981
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:26,410
The bust stop is quite far from here.

982
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,450
(Coach Choi)

983
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:47,850
It's taking longer than I thought.

984
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:49,910
I'm sorry.

985
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:52,080
No, I love it...

986
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,710
I mean, I'm fine.

987
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:02,880
It's raining.

988
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:06,510
Come to think of it,

989
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:09,650
it always rains when I'm with you.

990
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:11,680
That's true.

991
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:13,950
Maybe the dark clouds follow me around.

992
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,680
No. It's the opposite.

993
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:20,280
The sunlight follows you around instead.

994
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:23,350
No, it doesn't.

995
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:27,910
Dr. Jeong.

996
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:32,780
Please speak to me casually. You're much older than me.

997
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:36,010
I shouldn't. You're my patient.

998
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:37,750
I should stay professional.

999
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:41,750
Your patient. I see.

1000
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:47,650
Not that kind of patient.

1001
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:49,350
Please don't misunderstand.

1002
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:56,150
You're cute sometimes.

1003
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:58,010
I'm sorry. That was rude.

1004
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:00,780
No. That's good to hear.

1005
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:04,910
No one has ever told me that I'm cute.

1006
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:08,950
I'm glad.

1007
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:12,780
I'm glad that I passed along that street...

1008
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:15,710
on the day I carried the dressing table.

1009
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:20,910
I'm glad that it was raining, and I didn't take an umbrella.

1010
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,080
I'm glad that...

1011
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:26,850
I didn't give up running towards him.

1012
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:30,480
I'm so glad that...

1013
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:34,380
I was born as a girl.

1014
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,010
(Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo)

1015
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:51,280
My brother hates the feminine type of girls.

1016
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,110
Guys don't like female weightlifters.

1017
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:55,410
What's wrong with them? I think they're great.

1018
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:58,250
- Say hello. This is my dad. - What's going on with you two?

1019
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:00,650
- What? My weight class? - Eat some more.

1020
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:02,710
Instead, we did two things today.

1021
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:05,410
Watch out, Bok Joo! Are you captivated by it?

1022
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:07,610
- I totally am. - Bok Joo.

1023
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,850
Why do you go to a weight clinic?
