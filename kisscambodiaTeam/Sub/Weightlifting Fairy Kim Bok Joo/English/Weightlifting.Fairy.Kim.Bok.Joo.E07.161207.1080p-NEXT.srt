00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,440
Si Ho. Where are you going?

3
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,110
What is it, Dad? It's early.

4
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,140
What brings both of you here?

5
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,680
What is this?

6
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,780
Tell me what it is, you brat!

7
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,140
Are you dumb? Why can't you answer me?

8
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,180
What on earth is this?

9
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,310
Dad.

10
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,180
Don't yell at her right away. You're scaring her.

11
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,680
Let her explain first.

12
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,810
Be quiet, you punk.

13
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,080
Stay quiet before I beat you up.

14
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,240
Your name is written on here. Why does it have your name?

15
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,440
Dad.

16
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,010
I heard this place is weight clinic.

17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,540
So why does it have your name?

18
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,440
Explain why your name is on it!

19
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,440
Mr. Kim. Please calm down.

20
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,340
She is out of her mind. I should teach her a lesson.

21
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,480
Dad...

22
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,510
- Come here, you brat! - Please stop.

23
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,540
You should have been training. What on earth have you been doing?

24
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,580
- Dad. I'm so sorry. - Come here!

25
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,740
- Please. - Let go of me.

26
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,040
- Please calm down. - She deserves a beating. Come here!

27
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,380
Gosh, calm down! You have to.

28
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,010
Your blood pressure will go up and you'll collapse.

29
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,080
- Do you want to die? - Fine. Kill me instead.

30
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,510
- Just go, Bok Joo. - Where do you think you're going?

31
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,780
- Come here right now! - We'll take care of this.

32
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,740
Bok Joo! Where are you going? Come here!

00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,680
Counting 22,

35
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,240
and 23.

36
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,140
Bok Joo. Do it right. Straighten your arms.

37
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,910
What on earth were you thinking while going to that place?

38
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,110
Was it out of curiosity?

39
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,010
Did you want to take a look what's inside?

40
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,140
Or did you want to lose weight like other girls...

41
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,680
and wear miniskirts? Is that it?

42
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,310
Bok Joo.

43
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,810
You're a weightlifter, okay?

44
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,310
You're not just an ordinary college girl.

45
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,480
Your father, Coach Choi, and I...

46
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,810
have such high hopes for you.

47
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,080
How could you let us down like this?

48
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,410
You should be trying hard...

49
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,180
to bulk up.

50
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,780
Are you revolting? Don't you care about weightlifting now?

51
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,310
- I'm sorry. - Do 100 squats.

52
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,740
Don't try any tricks and finish it.

53
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,280
A weight clinic? You went to that ridiculous place...

54
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,940
and lost muscles. You need to put them back on.

55
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,710
Don't let go of the barbell.

56
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,040
She has a fine figure.

57
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,040
Why did she go there and try to lose weight? This is so upsetting.

58
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,010
(Weightlifting Team)

59
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,740
What on earth is going on?

60
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,210
Bok Joo must have gone crazy. Why would she...

61
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,080
Why would she go to a weight clinic?

62
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,140
She could have gone there out of curiosity.

63
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,640
Have you gone crazy, too?

64
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,240
Don't be absurd. You can't do such a thing out of curiosity.

65
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,180
She's a weightlifter and...

66
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,640
she is aiming for the gold medal in the Olympics.

67
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,740
A weight clinic?

68
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,880
Gosh. I just can't understand her.

69
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,140
Was she lured or something?

70
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,810
Maybe she decided to work on her looks because Joon Hyung rejected...

71
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,310
That's not true.

72
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,380
How do you know if it's true or not?

73
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,310
I'm just saying...

74
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,480
that she didn't seem like she liked him that much.

75
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,180
Hi, Mom.

76
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,640
Of course I know it's Jae Yi's birthday.

77
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,310
Dinner tonight?

78
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,840
Wasn't it this weekend?

79
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,810
I'm okay with it, of course.

80
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,310
All right. See you later.

81
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,410
That's right. I am a loyal friend.

82
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,810
I must share...

83
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,380
such useful information with Chubs.

84
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,540
Here's your second gift.

85
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,310
Today is my brother's birthday.

86
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,540
(A message from Joon Hyung)

00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,510

88
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,510

89
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,710
99.

90
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,210
100.

91
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,580
Here, Bok Joo.

92
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,540
Here you go.

93
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,810
Get a massage.

94
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,410
Otherwise, you can't train tomorrow.

95
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,410
I don't think you went there simply out of curiosity.

96
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,310
You're not that immature or irresponsible.

97
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,810
You're so dedicated to weightlifting.

98
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,310
I don't understand why you did such a thing.

99
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,510
I wonder why, and I'm worried about you.

100
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,810
Why did you do it?

101
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,740
You must have a reason!

102
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,080
Why did you go there?

103
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,780
Listen.

104
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,310
Instead of being...

105
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,480
a weight clinic,

106
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,640
is it a place that uses innocent young girls for something else?

107
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,280
No, Coach Choi. It's not.

108
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,810
Then did you really go there to lose weight?

109
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,910
Are you not going to tell me?

110
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,080
I thought we were more than just...

111
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,180
a coach and a trainee.

112
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,440
Now I know the truth.

113
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,310
I'm sorry, Coach Choi.

114
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,310
Anyway,

115
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,310
your training for heavyweight class must continue.

116
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,180
You're going to be under my watch throughout the day.

117
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,010
You aren't allowed to leave campus.

118
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,780
If you must leave, ask for permission.

119
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,810
I'm against violence, but if you disobey, violence may be used.

120
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,210
Do you understand?

121
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,440
Yes.

122
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,310
Go and get some rest.

123
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,540
Bok Joo.

124
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,480
Get up.

125
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,310
You must hang in there.

126
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,280
If you don't get a massage, you'll be more sore.

127
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,910
Why did you even go there? Have you lost your mind?

128
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,910
You're strong-willed for nothing.

129
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,910
Why would you do 100 squats just because they told you to?

130
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,810
Look how hard her calves are.

131
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,180
They're so hard.

132
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,740
Won't you tell us?

133
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,110
Why did you go there?

134
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,610
Come on, let's give her some time.

135
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,240
She can't talk about it right now.

136
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,810
She needs proper treatment for her muscles.

137
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,640
How could Professor Yoon make her do 100 squats?

138
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,680
He probably thought that she'd stop after a while.

139
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,810
What a mess.

140
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,580
- It's not like she'll be a model. - Hey, watch it.

141
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,680
- It's because I'm upset. - I am, too.

142
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,110
My goodness. I hate you.

143
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,310
Gosh.

144
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,880
How far will I go?

145
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,410
This is the worst.

146
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,410
Hey, wake up!

147
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,140
Si Ho.

148
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,010
Hello, Ms. Go.

149
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,680
I wish we could have some beer together,

150
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,310
but today is my best friend's birthday. Let's drink this instead.

151
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,910
May I ask you...

152
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,310
why you're so upset?

153
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,080
It's because of me.

154
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,480
I hate myself.

155
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,240
I did something terrible to someone.

156
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,910
It was because I was jealous.

157
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,210
Jealousy can be serious.

158
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:46,580
I've been very jealous once because of a man.

159
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,410
Is it about the man you mentioned last time?

160
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,140
That love triangle?

161
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,810
It isn't a love triangle.

162
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,480
I'm not sure what it is.

163
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,640
Don't blame yourself so much.

164
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,680
Let's cheer.

165
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,010
For being jealous.

166
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,180
Yes?

167
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,550
Doctor, Bok Joo isn't answering her phone.

168
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,910
Let's wait a little longer and get off work.

169
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,280
Okay, Doctor.

170
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,010
She wouldn't be absent without calling in advance.

171
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,640
It's delicious.

172
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,740
Food at the restaurant is the best.

173
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,610
Of course. My dishes won't taste like this.

174
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,380
It'd be pointless to cook and annoying to clean up.

175
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,980
I like this, too. We had seaweed soup for breakfast.

176
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,540
It's delicious.

177
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,980
- Hello, Ah Young. - Where are you?

178
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,480
I'm at your clinic, but you already left.

179
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,480
I got off work early.

180
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,310
Why didn't you call me?

181
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,380
Are you at your birthday party?

182
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,310
Can I meet you?

183
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,410
I'm having dinner with my family.

184
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,510
Who is it?

185
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,280
- Tell your friend to come here. - You should.

186
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,110
It's okay with us.

187
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,310
It's a woman.

188
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,010
Can you come here for a bit?

189
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,810
We've only heard about you.

190
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,540
We finally get to meet you.

191
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,810
You're so beautiful.

192
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,440
No.

193
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,080
You're more beautiful.

194
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,710
What's going on here?

195
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,910
What's wrong?

196
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,910
Your mom is beautiful.

197
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,980
Her skin is beautiful...

198
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,880
and her skin is beautiful.

199
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,610
Her skin is beautiful.

200
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,010
Only your skin is beautiful.

201
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,010
What did you say?

202
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,110
- Mr. Jeong, you're so funny. - Do you think so?

203
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,410
I wondered why Jae Yi and Joon Hyung...

204
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,310
were so different from one another.

205
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,780
Joon Hyung must take after you.

206
00:11:58,810 --> 00:11:59,810
Let's eat.

207
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,440
Mom, Dad. Eat some more.

208
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,540
- Have some more. - You, too.

209
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,740
Your friend didn't come without any notice. Do you know why?

210
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,280
Do you mean Bok Joo?

211
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,740
She'd never do that.

212
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,010
- Did you call her? - She didn't pick up.

213
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,240
Is she busy playing the cello?

214
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,680
She hasn't answered my text message either.

215
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,710
I'm sorry.

216
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,540
It was uncomfortable for you, right?

217
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,740
No, it was fun.

218
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,910
I like your parents.

219
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,210
I think Mom is worried these days.

220
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,210
She isn't explicit about it,

221
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:47,010
but she's curious about every young female customer at her pharmacy.

222
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,810
She's inquisitive simply out of habit.

223
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,110
Okay, I didn't complain, did I?

224
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,210
You're so defensive.

225
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,480
All mothers around her age are like that.

226
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,640
My mom considers every colleague and friend of mine...

227
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,180
she's heard of...

228
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,910
as my potential husband.

229
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,240
It's not a big deal. Don't take it so seriously.

230
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,280
You hurt my feelings.

231
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,380
I didn't take it that seriously.

232
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,810
Are you afraid that I'd hope for something else?

233
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,610
That I might try to make you as my husband?

234
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,110
No.

235
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,810
I just didn't want you to feel uncomfortable.

236
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,280
You're making me feel more uncomfortable.

237
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,680
You're so paranoid.

238
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,310
See you later, Friend.

239
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,610
Ah Young.

240
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,240
Happy Birthday.

241
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,110
My goodness.

242
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:05,010
Bok Joo would have gone if she knew today's Jae Yi's birthday.

243
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,310
- The number you've dialed is not... - What?

244
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,680
Is she ignoring my calls?

245
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,580
Did something happen to her?

246
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,810
(Bok Chicken)

247
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,010
Is she not here?

248
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,810
Hello.

249
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,010
You're that abalone thief.

250
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,180
- Excuse me? - What's up?

251
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,510
Is Bok Joo home?

252
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,580
She didn't pick up her phone.

253
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,280
It's because she can't pick up her phone.

254
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,910
She got into trouble, so everyone is watching her.

255
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,210
What kind of trouble?

256
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,480
Come closer.

257
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,380
You must keep it a secret.

258
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,980
I'm telling you this because you're her friend.

259
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,480
Okay.

260
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,010
Bok Joo has been...

261
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,810
secretly going to a weight clinic or whatever it's called.

262
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,840
She got caught, and it turned into a huge deal.

263
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,310
Her professor and coach showed up at our restaurant, and her dad...

264
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,840
was swinging a bat at her in fury.

265
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,110
If I didn't stop him, she would've been beaten up to a pulp.

266
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,980
Bok Joo's dad is hot-tempered.

267
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,510
Nothing can stop him when he's angry.

268
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,610
When he was an athlete,

269
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,610
people used to call him Crazy Dog. He was like a crazy old dog.

270
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,180
Why did you get caught?

271
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,910
You're so careless, Bok Joo.

272
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,040
(A message from Joon Hyung)

273
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,780
(Today is my brother's birthday.)

274
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,510
Here's your second gift. Today is my brother's birthday.

275
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,110
Are you all right?

276
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,610
Are you kidding me right now?

277
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,410
You better take more rice than that.

278
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,480
One more round.

279
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,880
What's wrong? Has the weight clinic made you...

280
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,680
think that food is poison or something?

281
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,940
You used to eat 2 to 3 plates easily.

282
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,040
Will you not go for heavyweight class?

283
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,880
That's not it. I'll be right back.

284
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,750
We should...

285
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,510
Look, there she is.

286
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,680
Why does everyone look so tense?

287
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,910
Gosh, look at their faces. It looks like a scene from a horror movie.

288
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,210
Even their coach seems so upset.

289
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,610
The coach is keeping a tight rein on her.

290
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,680
You have gained 0.53kg.

291
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,410
If you lose even 0.01kg from here,

292
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,910
I'm going to ramp up the program.

293
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,280
So eat instant noodles at night or do whatever you can to keep it up.

294
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,510
Do 3 sets of 20 squats. Start now.

295
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,840
Okay.

296
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,510
Woon Gi, it's your turn.

297
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,980
- Hello. - Hello.

298
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,040
Hello.

299
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,580
Isn't the training session starting in 30 minutes? Where is everyone?

300
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,940
- Woon Gi. - Yes, Professor.

301
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,110
Everyone is supposed to warm up now.

302
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,310
Where are the others?

303
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,680
- I'll tell them to gather now. - These brats...

304
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,610
I've been too lenient with you guys. You need to be disciplined.

305
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,810
Hey, is this how you're going to manage the team?

306
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,310
- Jung Woo. - Yes.

307
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,250
Did you get an X-ray of your knee?

308
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,880
It's better now, so I was going to get it done after the match.

309
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,940
After the match? When?

310
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,510
What if you end up with a broken knee? Will you quit weightlifting?

311
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:15,680
Why am I even talking to you guys? You never listen to me anyway.

312
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,250
You fools.

313
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,710
Gosh, I'm upset. Goodness gracious.

314
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,310
I'll be back.

315
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,250
Why is everyone so on edge today?

316
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,250
Bok Joo, I heard you got yourself in another trouble.

317
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,610
Isn't Professor Yoon mad because of you?

318
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,750
Hey, what did you do this time?

319
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,410
- Did you get dead drunk or what? - No, I didn't.

320
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,080
Please let us live in peace, Bok Joo.

321
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,880
Worrying about my unstable future...

322
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,110
is already giving me enough headache.

323
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,880
Please, Bok Joo. No more trouble, okay?

324
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,210
Gosh, my head hurts.

325
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,410
She probably got drunk and caused a scene.

326
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,210
Yes, Uncle.

327
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,610
Gosh, I think she's in big trouble.

328
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,580
Why did I get involved? I can't stop worrying.

329
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,180
Hey, are you okay or what?

330
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,010
- Hey, Bok Joo. - Hey!

331
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,010
Wait up. I'll go with you.

332
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,380
What was that about? Am I invisible?

333
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,750
Where are you going in such a rush, Bok Joo?

334
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,010
She's so busy.

335
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,750
Darn it.

336
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,250
Hey, you're here.

337
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,840
Is Dad inside?

338
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,610
Uncle, what happened to your eye?

339
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,510
I'm so sick and tired of his bad temper.

340
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,080
He has been throwing a fit, saying that he shouldn't bother getting...

341
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,980
dialysis when his daughter disrespects him.

342
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,210
He punched me when I was trying to drag him to the hospital.

343
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,680
Please wait here for a moment, Coach.

344
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,310
Dad.

345
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,750
Get up. You need to go to the hospital.

346
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,380
If you don't, it'll get painful for you.

347
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,480
Dad, please.

348
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,480
Why does it matter to you?

349
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,910
You don't even care about me!

350
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,940
Whether I die or not, just mind your own business.

351
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:46,310
I can't really afford my hefty medical bill anyway. This works out.

352
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,780
If I die, you can pay for your sessions at the weight clinic...

353
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,180
with the condolence money.

354
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,410
How can you say that to your daughter?

355
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,280
You cannot protest by skipping your appointment at the hospital.

356
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,210
Yes, I went to the weight clinic,

357
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:04,980
but how is what you're doing now any different from what I did?

358
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,410
What? How dare you talk back to me?

359
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,140
Get up.

360
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:14,410
Where's the clinic? It's the one after the intersection, isn't it?

361
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:18,080
I should go speak to the doctor. He seduced a naive student...

362
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,880
to make money. I shall teach this scum a serious lesson!

363
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,510
Dad. Dad, Dad!

364
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,740
That father-and-daughter duo seriously kills me.

365
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,810
What do you say? Would you like a glass?

366
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,010
I bet you're as frustrated as I am.

367
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,040
I don't drink soda on an empty stomach.

368
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,080
I see.

369
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,010
Where did it go?

370
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,740
Gosh, for goodness' sake.

371
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,210
You're getting on my nerves.

372
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:11,610
No, Dad! No, no! Dad, please...

373
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,710
- Why can't I go talk to him? - Dad, please...

374
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,810
That weight clinic or whatever it's called.

375
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,780
I'm going go destroy it so that he has to shut it down.

376
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,380
- Gosh! - Dad, no!

377
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,040
No, Dad. You can't go there. Dad, please.

378
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,310
- Dad, please don't do this. - Let go of me!

379
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,780
Let go! You didn't do anything wrong.

380
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,140
All of this is that money-greedy doctor's fault.

381
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,110
You only used to care about weightlifting. He must've lured you.

382
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,840
That must be why you went there when you couldn't even afford it.

383
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,310
Let go, you brat!

384
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:41,080
That's not true, Dad. I went there on my own.

385
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,910
Dad, please. I won't go there ever again.

386
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:45,580
- I won't even go near the clinic. - Shut it, you brat...

387
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,140
- Gosh! - Dad, Dad! Are you okay?

388
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,310
- Dad! - Bok Joo, call a taxi.

389
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:53,910
I'll do it.

390
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,610
Dad, I'm sorry.

391
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:59,780
- Let's go to the hospital now... - Chang Geol.

392
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,140
Dad. Dad, please...

393
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,510
And up!

394
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:16,980
Your posture is not stable.

395
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,680
Si Ho, are you going to keep being like this?

396
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,840
You have to be stable in the pivot position.

397
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,410
Will you be able to go on the competition tomorrow?

398
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,310
Do it again.

399
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,310
You're driving me crazy.

400
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,580
Why can't you keep your balance?

401
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,310
It's disrupting the flow.

402
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,880
Gosh, you're stressing me out.

403
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,980
(Hemodialysis Room)

404
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,080
It's okay. He's receiving hemodialysis. He'll be fine.

405
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,280
You should get back to the training.

406
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,580
But still...

407
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,740
It's okay. It will take hours.

408
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,080
Coach Choi. Please take her back to school with you.

409
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,580
I'm sorry we caused you trouble.

410
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,110
Not at all.

411
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,940
Drink it. You must've been startled.

412
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,840
Thank you.

413
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,110
It's normal for your father to react that way.

414
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,380
He has been...

415
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,780
devoting his life to look after you.

416
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,940
You should be good to your father.

417
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,440
I know.

418
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,710
Excuse me.

419
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,440
Hello? This is Choi Seong Eun.

420
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,710
I submitted the record of expenses and the receipts yesterday.

421
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,610
It doesn't add up?

422
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,110
Okay. I'll go and check right now.

423
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,540
Okay.

424
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,510
I have to go to the administration office.

425
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:08,740
Drink this, go to the gym, and set up the equipment.

426
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,110
Woon Gi should be there.

427
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,980
- Go straight to the gym, okay? - Okay.

428
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,410
Woon Gi.

429
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,410
Why are you alone? Where is Bok Joo?

430
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,640
Bok Joo didn't come.

431
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,310
I thought she went out with you.

432
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,110
I just can't find an answer to this.

433
00:26:58,810 --> 00:26:59,840
I'm talking about Bok Joo.

434
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,580
She was raising her weight class,

435
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,280
and she didn't care about losing weight at all.

436
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,980
Come to think of it, she lied about having hemorrhoids.

437
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,310
She snuck out to go to that clinic.

438
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,510
Why did she do that?

439
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,110
Do you have any ideas?

440
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,310
Gosh, of course not. How would I know?

441
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,710
Something definitely feels weird.

442
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,380
I thought I knew Bok Joo well.

443
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,840
I'm a bit disappointed that she lied to us.

444
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:31,580
She must have had some reasons.

445
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,540
So what can those reasons be?

446
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,710
I can't even guess at what they are.

447
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:40,910
Frankly, why is it so bad that she went to a weight clinic?

448
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,280
What's bad is we're weightlifters.

449
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,880
Why is it bad to be a weightlifter?

450
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,910
Hello, Coach Choi?

451
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,440
Bok Joo?

452
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,940
She's not in her room.

453
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,940
I thought she was training.

454
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,110
Dr. Jeong.

455
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,110
Did you have a happy birthday yesterday?

456
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,080
I don't think...

457
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:16,110
I'll be able to see you any more.

458
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,880
If I had been honest with you from the beginning,

459
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:26,440
would I have been able to wish you a happy birthday in person?

460
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,410
I'm Kim Bok Joo, a sophomore at Haneol Sport University.

461
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,440
I'm a weightlifter.

462
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,580
I've always had great strength since I was little.

463
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:46,210
Rather than elegant classical music, I like Big Bang's songs much better.

464
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,110
I love sausages.

465
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,510
I like to do morning exercise in winter.

466
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,280
I also like the smell of the ground on rainy days.

467
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,710
And...

468
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,580
I...

469
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,110
like you.

470
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,010
It's okay.

471
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,910
I'm dumb and simple-minded.

472
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,640
I'll forget you soon.

473
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,110
I will...

474
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,940
stay sad...

475
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,210
only until today.

476
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,710
Dr. Jeong.

477
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,080
Happy belated birthday.

478
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,210
(Happy belated birthday.)

479
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,610
It's a day late,

480
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,080
but happy birthday to you.

481
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,580
Hi, Joon Hyung.

482
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,510
Gosh, you finally answered.

483
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:38,280
Why is it so hard to get you on the phone?

484
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,540
Sorry. What is it?

485
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,480
You know why I called.

486
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,610
Are you okay?

487
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,410
Your coach seemed to be following you everywhere.

488
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,210
Are you holding out okay?

489
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,640
Yes.

490
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,510
How did you know about that?

491
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,310
Bok Joo!

492
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,210
My gosh, Bok Joo.

493
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,080
Hello?

494
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:08,840
Hey, Chubs.

495
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,280
Did you hang up?

496
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,580
She hung up.

497
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,810
Gosh, not again.

498
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,640
What is it this time?

499
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,410
I'm asking you a question, Bok Joo.

500
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,880
Where have you been?

501
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,440
I had some errands to run.

502
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,640
I told you to practice, not to run errands.

503
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,410
Give me a good excuse, at least!

504
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,680
What errand was so urgent to run?

505
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,210
Are you going to stay silent again?

506
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,310
You don't want to talk to me. Is that it?

507
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,510
All right. Fine.

508
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,810
I warned you I'm ready to use force.

509
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,010
I did.

510
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,110
Assume push-up position.

511
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,810
I guess 20 lashes are enough.

512
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,280
Count it right.

513
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,210
One.

514
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,210
Two.

515
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,680
Coach Choi! Coach Choi...

516
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,580
Coach Choi.

517
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,180
I'll tell you what happened.

518
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,410
Nan Hee.

519
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,940
That's why she went there.

520
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:38,410
She wasn't trying to lose weight.

521
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,280
I asked her where she had been earlier.

522
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,310
She said yesterday was that doctor's birthday,

523
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,310
so she went to leave him a present.

524
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,940
You know that this has never...

525
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,610
happened to Bok Joo.

526
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,680
When you like someone,

527
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,840
you can't let the feelings go easily.

528
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,110
When I was 19 years old,

529
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,680
I ran away from home once.

530
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,210
I fell in love with a guy.

531
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,710
After a dinner and a night view of the sea,

532
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:20,840
he said we must go back home,

533
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,580
or his parents would kill him.

534
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:24,010
I had given up...

535
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:27,880
everything including weightlifting to run away with him.

536
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,180
But...

537
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,110
do you know what bothered me more than feeling betrayed?

538
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,610
I couldn't get over that jerk.

539
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,540
I guess that's how girls are.

540
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,740
Once I started to like him, I couldn't stop easily.

541
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,010
How silly.

542
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,010
Bok Joo.

543
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,840
Hey.

544
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:03,110
Your heart is breaking inside, right?

545
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,010
It's okay. It will pass. All right?

546
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,680
You know about the dead point, right?

547
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:16,710
You're out of breath and you feel like you'll die soon.

548
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:19,010
But if you pass that point, it becomes tolerable.

549
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:21,840
Everything works in the same way. Okay?

550
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,110
Coach.

551
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,780
It's good to have this kind of experience.

552
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,440
Now or later, if you meet a guy...

553
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:38,840
whom you can be yourself around and who loves you, date him.

554
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:43,010
Why can't weightlifters date?

555
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:44,650
You can. I won't stop you.

556
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,810
Coach.

557
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,510
Gosh.

558
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:57,810
Hey.

559
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,710
Where did she go? She even hung up my phone like that.

560
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,010
She's not in the gym.

561
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:11,380
Who's the punk that made Bok Joo cry?

562
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,780
I'll come to get you if you give her a hard time!

563
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,710
- Coach Choi. - Bok Joo.

564
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:20,110
It's okay.

565
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,240
Everything will be okay after you finish crying.

566
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,940
I'll talk to the head of your dormitory.

567
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,280
You should sleep at home tonight.

568
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,380
Calm yourself down.

569
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,110
You should spend some time with your dad, too.

570
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,810
Coach Choi.

571
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,040
You have to start training hard tomorrow.

572
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,610
I won't cut any slacks.

573
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:51,710
Bring back your awesomeness.

574
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,580
- Okay? - Yes.

575
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,810
- Thank you, Coach. - Go on.

576
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,610
Go on now!

577
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,540
You're in love, which can be lonely.

578
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:13,440
There is no answer to love.

579
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,680
Darn it.

580
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,510
- Are you getting off work? - Yes. How's Bok Joo?

581
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:31,680
Don't worry so much. She'll work hard.

582
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,680
You said giving our trust is a way to support, so we must trust her.

583
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,310
Right. Trust is real when you trust something that you can't see.

584
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,110
Hardships are necessary for growth.

585
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,810
You should go home soon.

586
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,610
Okay, get home safely. Make sure to have dinner.

587
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,910
Gosh, you aren't my wife.

588
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,910
He's so poetic.

589
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:34,310
I caught you, Bok Joo.

590
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,080
What is it?

591
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:40,480
The sausage works best to catch Bok Joo.

592
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,150
I bought it for you because you always crave for it.

593
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,980
It's not even that tasty. Here you go.

594
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:50,150
- Where are you going? - I'm going home.

595
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,780
- What about you? - Me?

596
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,440
I went to buy this sausage.

597
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,540
Why didn't you return my calls?

598
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,710
It just happened.

599
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,110
By the way, how did you know that I got caught?

600
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,180
There's a way to know.

601
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:12,510
Let's go. Have you had dinner yet?

602
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:16,110
- What about your curfew? - The rules are there...

603
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,180
for you to break.

604
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,310
- Let's go. - Hey.

605
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,610
What are we going to eat?

606
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,180
Come on, Seon Ok. Don't be upset.

607
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,240
You knew that Bok Joo has been going there.

608
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,910
I didn't know about it from the beginning.

609
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,610
You knew about it before I did.

610
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,810
That's why you were so calm.

611
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,610
Otherwise, you would have made a big fuss about it.

612
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:44,880
I wasn't sure whether I should tell you or not.

613
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,810
What gives you the right to know?

614
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,310
- It's not like that. - Forget it.

615
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,440
You're worse than Bok Joo.

616
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,810
Come on, Seon Ok.

617
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,110
- You're awesome! - Go away!

618
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,440
Gosh, that hurt.

619
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,710
Bok Joo. Look, it's meat.

620
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,210
It's your favorite.

621
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,980
You'll get to have this meat.

622
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,280
Why are you being so friendly?

623
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,280
- You're buying me meat? - I told you.

624
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,480
I found a 50-dollar bill on the street. I must spend it quickly.

625
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,480
Go ahead and eat.

626
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,610
Gosh, I have no appetite.

627
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:26,980
Here, Bok Joo. Open your mouth.

628
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:29,410
Here's some meat for Bok Joo.

629
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,710
Bok Joo, open your mouth.

630
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,010
Here. Come on.

631
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,810
Help yourself. Consider it a celebration for Jae Yi's birthday.

632
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,080
You don't need to be on a diet any more.

633
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:52,240
Why weren't you more careful? You got caught on his birthday.

634
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:58,440
He was worried because you missed your appointment without calling.

635
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:03,210
- Really? - Yes, you should have called.

636
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,440
I'm sure you didn't have the chance, though.

637
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:16,310
Hey, that's not cooked yet. Spit it out.

638
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,010
Spit it out.

639
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,040
Gosh, come here.

640
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,310
You have sauce on your arm.

641
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,210
My goodness, Bok Joo.

642
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,040
It's ready to eat. Go ahead.

643
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,610
You have to finish all the meat, okay?

644
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,610
Let's fill up the stomach and empty the mind.

645
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:44,980
I will treat everything for embarrassing yourself today.

646
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,780
Why are we at a club?

647
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,310
Clubbing is best when you have too much on your mind.

648
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:02,280
- I prefer going to a karaoke. - Can you open it for me?

649
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,080
That was amazing.

650
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,940
We must loosen up to have fun. Drink up!

651
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:20,040
- Shall we go have fun? - You go ahead.

652
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,710
- Are you ready? - Go ahead.

653
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,940
- Are you ready? - Go by yourself.

654
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:25,940
Come here, Bok Joo.

655
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:30,880
Come on. Will you just stand there?

656
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,810
- Go ahead. No. - Come on.

657
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:34,580
- Come on. - I don't want to.

658
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:37,480
Let's go. Please move out of the way.

659
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:40,610
Here we are, Bok Joo.

660
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:43,380
Dance with me. You're doing well.

661
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,780
You're doing well.

662
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,810
I knew you would, Bok Joo. Come on.

663
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,280
Why didn't I bring the credit card machine?

664
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,240
Stop it. You shouldn't drink.

665
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,880
Give it back. It's okay to have one drink.

666
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,810
You had more than one.

667
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,310
You're going to get swollen.

668
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,280
You can only have this much.

669
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,910
You're so cute.

670
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:13,610
You feel bad about scolding Bok Joo, don't you?

671
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,540
Think about it.

672
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:20,310
Bok Joo is 21 years old.

673
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:24,510
Wouldn't she also want to put on makeup, lose weight,

674
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,910
and go on dates like her peers?

675
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,680
She's also a woman.

676
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,580
She's not a woman. She's a weightlifter.

677
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:34,180
She's still a woman even if she does weightlifting.

678
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,180
Whenever I see Bok Joo,

679
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,040
I feel bad for her.

680
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,940
She's always in her sweatpants, on the motorcycle to make deliveries.

681
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:50,810
Her palms are rough like the back of a turtle.

682
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:54,410
Those aren't hands of a lady.

683
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:58,940
She lost her mom when she was young.

684
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:03,610
Her ignorant dad hits her everyday.

685
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:04,610
Be quiet.

686
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,580
Go to bed if you'll keep talking that way.

687
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,040
I was on my way anyway.

688
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:11,510
Don't drink any more bottle.

689
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:21,080
I feel bad for her, too.

690
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,610
That's why she shouldn't give up.

691
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:32,280
She must at least win a gold medal.

692
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,680
She can't regret like me.

693
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,480
You can't stop dancing, can you?

694
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:48,040
- You might turn into jelly. - I know.

695
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,810
I didn't think I was the clubbing type, but it wasn't that bad.

696
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:52,810
The loser pays for the club next time, rock-paper-scissors.

697
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:57,380
- Gosh. - You pay for the club next time.

698
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,010
Why am I so terrible at playing rock-paper-scissors?

699
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:01,610
I always lose when I play with my friends.

700
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:05,410
By the way, how did you get caught?

701
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:06,810
My coach...

702
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,480
found my diet journal in the weightlifting room.

703
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,780
Hey, why did you leave it...

704
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:14,410
You're so clumsy.

705
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:17,110
I made sure to put it in my bag.

706
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:20,540
I have no idea how it ended up there. It's a mystery to me.

707
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,910
You obviously dropped it there.

708
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:23,110
Do you think a ghost put it there?

709
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,910
I know, right?

710
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:28,080
What's done is done. It doesn't even matter any more.

711
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,380
But...

712
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:34,040
I have no regrets.

713
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,310
I learned a lot, thanks to Dr. Jeong.

714
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,380
He made me realize that I'm a woman, too.

715
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:45,580
He taught me that a man can make my heart flutter...

716
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,610
as much as weightlifting does.

717
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,410
And you realized that you can...

718
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:56,980
dance around like this, too.

719
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,310
I was just about to get immersed in my sensibilities. Goodness.

720
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:04,910
Hey, will you be okay with sleeping outside without permission?

721
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:07,580
Well, I do it all the time.

722
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:09,410
Why do you ask?

723
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:12,910
- Are you worried? - Of course I'm worried.

724
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:14,880
You might get caught. How can I not worry?

725
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,780
You're so sweet, Bok Joo.

726
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,210
Hey, don't touch me.

727
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,380
Why not? Why can't I touch you?

728
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,210
Do you want to be put behind bars or what?

729
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:28,540
You're finally back to being yourself.

730
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,780
Cheer up, you fool. Being chatty and bubbly is your charm.

731
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:34,410
Being all quiet makes you so boring.

732
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,180
Call me whenever you need a mood booster.

733
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,840
I'll tease you.

734
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,310
Hey.

735
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:54,310
You got permission, so use the front door.

736
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:55,540
I have to go through the back door.

737
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:56,840
Okay. Be careful.

738
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:02,940
Hey.

739
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:06,210
I had fun today,

740
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:08,040
thanks to you.

741
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,210
(Dormitory)

742
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,110
I had fun today, too.

743
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:16,310
Thanks to you.

744
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:25,310
(Student Dormitory)

745
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,510
My coach...

746
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:30,140
found my diet journal in the weightlifting room.

747
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,880
(Weightlifting Department)

748
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,310
Jeong Joon Hyung. That was so unlike him.

749
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,080
Well.

750
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,310
I guess they share the same blood, after all.

751
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:02,840
I do see a tiny bit of resemblance between Dr. Jeong and him.

752
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:04,310
A teeny-weeny bit.

753
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,210
You woke up early today, Si Ho.

754
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,540
Yes, I have a competition today.

755
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:36,140
I heard you went home. You're back early.

756
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:39,540
Yes. I got up early for some reason.

757
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,940
How are you feeling?

758
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,040
You didn't look well yesterday.

759
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:51,010
I'm fine. I'm strong as steel.

760
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:53,010
Thanks for your concern.

761
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:57,010
Good luck with your competition. I'll be rooting for you.

762
00:48:57,610 --> 00:48:59,540
I'm going to take a quick nap then.

763
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,280
They are saying...

764
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,640
- What are you doing? - I knew it.

765
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,540
- I don't know. - What do you mean?

766
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:29,680
- Gosh, I'm so tired. - Cut it out.

767
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,680
This won't work, right?

768
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,110
You should have woke me up. How can you leave without me?

769
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:37,280
I thought you were skipping the run.

770
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:39,640
Come here for a second.

771
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:42,140
What's the matter?

772
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,940
Seon Ok is so mad at us right now.

773
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:48,740
Because I knew about it and didn't tell her.

774
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:50,210
She thinks we excluded her on purpose.

775
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,380
Things got so messed up.

776
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:55,210
Gosh, that's not what happened. That fool.

777
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:56,880
What should we do?

778
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,310
You know how bull-headed she can be.

779
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:01,110
She can be so difficult.

780
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:03,410
It's all my fault.

781
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,640
(Dad)

782
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:14,210
(Bok Chicken)

783
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,310
I'm here, Dad.

784
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:25,910
I told you to come by when you have time. Why did you come so early?

785
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,780
- Have you had breakfast yet? - Yes, I ate two plates.

786
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:30,880
Coach Choi will buy me jokbal, too.

787
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:36,210
Don't worry about this. I'll do it.

788
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,610
How are you feeling by the way?

789
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:48,210
Didn't you receive hemodialysis too late yesterday?

790
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:50,140
Don't pretend that you're worried about me.

791
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:54,040
Why did you lie to me if you care about me that much?

792
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,010
Take this.

793
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:07,410
- What is this? - Just open it. I got it for you.

794
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,780
I heard that all girls use things like that these days.

795
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,210
Don't use it when you train.

796
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:17,140
Just use it when you go out or when you want to dress up.

797
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,710
It's a pretty color.

798
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:21,940
They said that it just came out.

799
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:24,380
Apparently, it's the most popular product at the moment.

800
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:27,210
All of those things look the same to me, though.

801
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,580
What do you think? Do I look pretty, Dad?

802
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:32,140
I'm not used to it.

803
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:34,280
Eat something before you go.

804
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:36,540
I have ribs in the refrigerator.

805
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:39,410
Shall I grill some? Or do you want braised ribs?

806
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:40,740
Can you make me both?

807
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,080
Have some shame, will you?

808
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,810
Do you want spicy braised ribs?

809
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:23,310
(Best of luck, Song Si Ho of Haneol Sport University.)

810
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,380
Si Ho.

811
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,410
Don't forget to keep your balance, okay?

812
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,910
Do every move accurately and pay attention to your legs.

813
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,580
Be especially careful with the pivot position.

814
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:38,640
Number Four for Ribbon.

Song Si Ho of Haneol Sport University.

816
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:45,210
- Go, Si Ho! - You got this!

817
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,510
- You look stunning! - Best of luck!

818
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:01,810
Hey, Joon Hyung. What are you doing?

819
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:03,310
Go faster!

820
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,710
Do you think you're out for a walk or what?

821
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:07,040
Get ready to do a turn.

822
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:10,710
Go, go. Keep going.

823
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,040
Goodness!

824
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:16,080
You have to go faster.

825
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:18,080
Kick harder. Harder.

826
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,110
Go faster. Keep going.

827
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:29,410
Hey, what's the matter with you? Why do you have no energy today?

828
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,840
You used to go another 14 to 15m effortlessly after a turn.

829
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:46,710
You fool.

830
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:48,110
Where did you sleep last night?

831
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:50,280
What are you talking about? I told you I stayed out all night.

832
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,410
My goodness.

833
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,610
Do you expect me to believe that you stayed out all night alone?

834
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:55,610
What time did you leave, whom were you with,

835
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:56,740
and what time did you get back?

836
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:57,810
Be quiet.

837
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,480
I have a lot on my mind right now.

838
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:01,680
Gosh, I'm speechless.

839
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,880
I put on a big show to cover for you yesterday.

840
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,910
I told the housemaster that you had diarrhea and ran for the toilet.

841
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:10,010
Gosh. I was quick to think of that.

842
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,610
He just pretended to be fooled because he didn't want to bother.

843
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:17,240
Where are you going? Wait for me.

844
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,010
I have things to do. I'll see you later.

845
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:26,140
- All right. - Hurry up.

846
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:31,880
(Rhythmic Gymnastics Team)

847
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,140
All of you did so well at the competition today.

848
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,910
Please check the mistakes carefully at home.

849
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:40,580
- Okay? - Yes.

850
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,310
- Dismiss. - Thank you.

851
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:47,310
Congratulations.

852
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:52,410
I liked your performance today.

853
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,310
Hang in there.

854
00:55:57,810 --> 00:55:58,880
What was that?

855
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:10,110
Hi, Joon Hyung.

856
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:12,740
Can I see you for a minute if you're not practicing?

857
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,380
- Joon Hyung. - You're here.

858
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:29,440
Did you do well on the competition?

859
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:31,640
Yes, I did.

860
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:34,810
Good for you.

861
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,580
My mirror broke this morning,

862
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:40,010
so I thought I'd have bad luck today.

863
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,640
But I guess it meant the opposite.

864
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:44,810
Si Ho.

865
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:47,680
- Yes? - Was it you?

866
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,240
I saw you in the morning a few days ago.

867
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:54,910
You went into the weightlifting gym.

868
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:58,180
It's not you, is it?

869
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:02,480
Why do you ask me when you already sensed it?

870
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:06,010
What?

871
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:08,980
It's me. I did it.

872
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,240
I left her diet journal at the weightlifting gym on purpose.

873
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,180
Why?

874
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:16,640
Why did you do that?

875
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,910
What good would it do to you?

876
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,780
Do you know how much trouble you caused Bok Joo?

877
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:23,880
What about you?

878
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,110
Why are you so upset?

879
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,580
- What? - It's none of your business.

880
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,810
Why are you getting angry and lashing out on me because of her?

881
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:34,810
Is she your girlfriend?

882
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:37,440
- Si Ho. - Fine.

883
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:40,280
I hated to see you giggling when you were with her.

884
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:43,740
She disarms you and it annoys me. But a weight clinic?

885
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:46,410
It was ridiculous that she went there.

886
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:49,140
She's a weightlifter. Why does she have to lose her weight? For whom?

887
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:51,980
What has become of you? We're not...

888
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,010
We're not in the relationship you think.

889
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:57,810
- She likes someone else. - What about you?

890
00:57:58,780 --> 00:57:59,910
How do you feel about her?

891
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:04,910
Gosh. I don't even know why I have to explain it to you,

892
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:07,910
- but we went to the same school... - I hate that, too.

893
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:12,140
I don't know what's wrong with me,

894
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:15,240
and I'm worried if I'm going crazy.

895
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:17,380
But I hate it.

896
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,540
I hate that you're with someone,

897
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:22,580
and I hate that you smile at someone other than me.

898
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:28,210
So, don't push me, or I'll go crazier.

899
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:45,410
He was worried because you missed your appointment without calling.

900
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:50,080
I should call the clinic and tell them that I won't be going.

901
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:52,880
What excuse should I give?

902
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:02,010
(Joon Hyung)

903
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,610
Hi, Joon Hyung. It's me.

904
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:11,810
What should I tell Dr. Jeong?

905
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:16,640
Hey. What are you up to?

906
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,810
Why do you keep calling Joon Hyung and seeing him?

907
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:20,580
I heard you like someone else.

908
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:23,110
Why are you making passes at Joon Hyung?

909
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:26,280
Making passes? What are you talking about?

910
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,910
I left your diet journal...

911
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:29,980
at the gym.

912
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:34,410
What? What did you just say?

913
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:50,010
I don't think I can go there any more.

914
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:52,780
- I'm going abroad to study. - What is your wish these days?

915
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:56,410
I wish that the person I like will like me back.

916
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:59,080
- Do you want to go see a movie? - A movie?

917
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:01,810
Gosh. Your boyfriend is so sweet.

918
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:04,910
Joon Hyung wants you to leave. His brother is on his way here.

919
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,310
I'm angry that you're close with Joon Hyung.

920
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,580
- I'm sorry, Chubs. - I'll never find love again.
