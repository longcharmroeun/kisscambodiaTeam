5
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,330
Joon Hyung. You'd better run fast.

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,130
If you lose, you'll be in trouble.

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,230
If you don't do this right, I'll punch you.

9
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,290
Hurry up and run!

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,830
- Hurry up! - Come on.

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,990
Run! Hurry up!

12
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,360
- I'll kill him. - What's wrong with him?

13
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,490
What are you doing, Mr. Reversed? Are you cleaning?

14
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,530
Our team lost because of you.

15
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,460
Are you saying you can eat the whole thing at once?

16
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,490
It's true. I can eat it in one bite.

17
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,860
- Stop lying, Bok Joo. - What? I'm serious.

18
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,660
He only runs the opposite way.

19
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,360
Don't talk to a fool who only runs the opposite way.

20
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,160
Move, you punk!

21
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,990
- Wow, it's Kim Bok Joo. - That was amazing.

22
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,430
No wonder why her nickname is Chubs.

23
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,430
Will you get off?

24
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,430
Oh, gosh.

25
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,360
You can touch the bottom with your feet.

26
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:50,930
Goodness.

27
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,760
Here.

28
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,690
Take this, too.

29
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,790
Anyway, thank you.

30
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,930
I'm sorry for misunderstanding you.

31
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,360
I'm sorry about the handkerchief even though...

32
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,460
I don't know why it shouldn't be washed. Forgive me.

33
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,130
Bok Joo.

34
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,860
So it's you.

35
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
Chubs!

36
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,190
Are you...

37
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,960
that skinny Mr. Reversed?

38
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,730
Yes, I'm Joon Hyung who ran the race the opposite way.

39
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,990
Hey, you've changed so much.

40
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,990
You're all grown up.

41
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,560
You're all grown up, too.

42
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,360
I thought you'd grow chubbier instead of getting taller.

43
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,760
It's really great to see you.

44
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,960
Yes, it's great to see you, too.

45
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,190
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,090
I have my training, so I have to go.

47
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,160
Gosh, I'm late.

48
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,560
I knew she looked familiar.

49
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,330
Hey.

50
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,430
I accept your apology.

51
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,930
We're even now after the bike accident.

52
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,460
It was good to see you.

53
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:33,960
See you again, Chubs.

54
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,660
Take care.

55
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,090
(Episode 2, When I Fall in Love with You)

56
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,730
Really?

57
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,260
That handsome swimmer went to the same elementary school as you?

58
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,000
That's right.

59
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,960
He was so short and skinny back then.

60
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,060
How did he get so tall?

61
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,860
Now, he's cool and such a smooth talker.

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,730
What a misfortune.

63
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,330
What do you mean? It's a blessing.

64
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,130
Introduce me to him. I'll take care of the rest.

65
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,260
Do you think he's a fool?

66
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,630
He won't fall for you.

67
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,630
My mom said plump women are...

68
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,360
a hidden beauty.

69
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,360
Once I lose weight,

70
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,090
I'll be as beautiful as any celebrity.

71
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,560
Stop talking nonsense.

72
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,690
- You're still a weightlifter. - Be quiet.

73
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,730
I'm in a serious situation.

74
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,530
I don't have a good feeling about it at all.

75
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,090
Goodness.

76
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,260
Hey, Chubs.

77
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,160
Who called me "Chubs"?

78
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,160
Who was that?

79
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,130
Hey.

80
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,090
I knew I had an ominous feeling about this.

81
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,590
Chubs.

82
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,360
Come on.

83
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,930
Hey, let's go.

84
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,230
- Wait for us. - Hey.

85
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,330
Where are you going? To the cafeteria?

86
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,890
Today's menu is bulgogi.

87
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,630
Enjoy it.

88
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,090
Chubs.

89
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,360
You have such broad shoulders. Keep working hard.

90
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,530
- Let's go. - Okay.

91
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,130
Why is he calling you...

92
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,790
- Chubs? - Was it your nickname as a child?

93
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,490
- Was it "Chubs"? - "Chubs"?

94
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,960
Chubs, Chubs!

95
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,430
They're eating so much.

96
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,160
It's so impressive.

97
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,730
How could they eat so much?

98
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,890
Shall we get one more tray?

99
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,960
- One more tray? - I think Bok Joo is already full.

100
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,160
No, I'm not.

101
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,660
You hesitated. It means you're full.

102
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,660
I can eat one more tray.

103
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,730
Hey, Chubs.

104
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,130
- What, Chubs? - Chubs?

105
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:47,890
Why are you eating so little?

106
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,990
Never mind, this is your second tray.

107
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,160
Enjoy your food, Chubs.

108
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,490
Hey.

109
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,730
- Did he call her Chubs? - I think so.

110
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,060
- Go, weightlifters. - Let's go!

111
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,190
- Go, weightlifters. - Let's go!

112
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,030
(Haneol Sport University)

113
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,690
Good morning, Chubs.

114
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,290
Give me a high-five.

115
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,330
Give me a high-five.

116
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,460
High-five.

117
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,190
I'll leave you alone if you do.

118
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,890
- Give me a high-five. - You punk.

119
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,490
Come on, run.

120
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,760
- Stop it. - Be careful, okay?

121
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,190
- Come on. - Gosh.

122
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,990
Hello, Chubs.

123
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,290
Joon Hyung.

124
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,260
From now on,

125
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,430
stop calling me Chubs.

126
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,790
I'm not Chubs any more.

127
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,530
I'm warning you.

128
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,930
For your information,

129
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,190
I beat up men, too.

130
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:23,890
Understand?

131
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,030
You don't like that name, do you?

132
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,590
I'm sorry, Chubs.

133
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,730
- What? - Yes.

134
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,760
No, I won't come.

135
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,630
Come on, I don't want to.

136
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,600
What do you want to tell me now?

137
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,530
What is it?

138
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,530
Should I get closer?

139
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,230
What is it?

140
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,690
- Hey. - I said I beat up men, too.

141
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,930
This is just a warning.

142
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,830
You'd better be careful.

143
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,230
Hey, you!

144
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,490
I can't help but call you by that name.

145
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,890
Once Chubs, you're always Chubs.

146
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,630
See you again, Chubs.

147
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,100
Her body seems heavy.

148
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,260
What's wrong with you?

149
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,060
- What did I do? - Stop it.

150
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,190
When she approached me, I thought my life was at risk.

151
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,990
She's a weightlifter, after all.

152
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,830
Why do you keep teasing her?

153
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,160
I don't know why, but it's so much fun.

154
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,600
It's funny that Bok Joo is a weightlifter.

155
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,230
It's also fun to see her get upset.

156
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,660
Other than getting taller, she hasn't changed much.

157
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,430
You must be having a lot of fun.

158
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,730
You're such a great guy.

159
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,690
It's so much fun!

160
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,360
Goodness, Joon Hyung is driving me crazy.

161
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,130
Who does he think he is?

162
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,600
He teases you more because you get so upset.

163
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,560
I can see that he's having a lot of fun.

164
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,690
It's not like you're completely innocent.

165
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,600
You made him look like a pervert.

166
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,460
Hey, it was just a misunderstanding.

167
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,530
Besides, I apologized to him.

168
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,790
Either way,

169
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,490
I'm so jealous of you.

170
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,430
I don't care if he teases me.

171
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,660
I'd love to have such a handsome friend like him.

172
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,530
Isn't it pleasing just to look at him?

173
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,530
He's such an eye candy.

174
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,560
Aren't you proud that you know him?

175
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,260
He's not an eye candy. He makes my blood boil.

176
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,430
You say that, but doesn't your heart flutter a little?

177
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,560
What?

178
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,430
Such a handsome friend approaches you out of the blue,

179
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,560
and your heart doesn't flutter at all?

180
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,530
I bet she's itching to go on a date with him.

181
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,030
He's not handsome at all.

182
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,690
I don't fall in love with every handsome man.

183
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,760
Unlike you two, I'm not interested in men at all.

184
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,360
I can't think about dating.

185
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,930
I'm too busy with weightlifting.

186
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,460
Of course you fall in love with handsome men.

187
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,490
Could you give us more pickles?

188
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:17,790
Goodness.

189
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,230
Excuse me?

190
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,290
Please give us more water.

191
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,690
This is Bok Chicken.

192
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:30,060
Four glasses of beer are coming up.

193
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,230
We have many deliveries. You'll have to wait 30 minutes.

194
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,460
Okay, we'll hurry. Thank you.

195
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,460
Dad, an order of half fried, half spicy.

196
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,460
The business is going really well here.

197
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,360
I think this place will get bigger.

198
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,790
You're right.

199
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,760
- It's delicious. - Help yourself.

200
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,460
Did you hear the order?

201
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,060
I'm not deaf. You should go back to school.

202
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,760
I fired the part-time worker.

203
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,290
Come on.

204
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,560
We didn't even discuss it.

205
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,790
Fine.

206
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,460
 SUBTITLES BY VIU N SYNC BY SA143 

207
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,530
What?

208
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,760
I'm not asking you to read my palm.

209
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,290
I'll work if you pay me.

210
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:11,960
If not, I'll report you to the Ministry of Labor for not paying me.

211
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,160
What did you say?

212
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,530
Then you should pay me for raising you all these years.

213
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,590
You eat twice as much as other people.

214
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,190
I work so hard to support you, and you don't work on weightlifting.

215
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,560
You're worse than her, you punk.

216
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,290
Why did you call her here?

217
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,530
How could we refuse to serve a big group of customers?

218
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,790
If you cook, and I serve, who would do the deliveries?

219
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,160
Don't talk back at me.

220
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,030
Could we get some more popcorn?

221
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,560
Yes, Sir.

222
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,760
- Isn't the popcorn delicious? - I'm thirsty.

223
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,060
My goodness.

224
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,830
Your popcorn is coming up soon.

225
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,630
Shall we order some chicken?

226
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,690
- This place makes good popcorn. - Okay, fine.

227
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,030
Please bring us a lot of popcorn.

228
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,960
Those cheap punks, how much popcorn do they need...

229
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,760
- for just two glasses of beer? - Watch your mouth.

230
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,130
He makes everyone at Haneol Sport University proud.

231
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,790
He's on the national shooting team.

232
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,290
It's Jong Suk.

233
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,830
People like him help us with our business.

234
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,560
You don't know how to run a business.

235
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,330
He totally belongs to me.

236
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,430
Get the popcorn.

237
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,060
Get it before I beat you.

238
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,030
- Joon Hyung. They're yours. - We did your laundry.

239
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,890
Gosh, thank you. It must be hard to be the minions.

240
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,360
Didn't you do mine?

241
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,860
No. You hardly put out your laundry.

242
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,060
Put it out already. Stop wearing the same clothes over and over.

243
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,730
Hey. Let me clear this up.

244
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,760
I swear I'm not...

245
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,590
dirty or lazy.

246
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,660
I just don't want to trouble them.

247
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,730
By the way, I'm hungry. Our dear juniors are working so hard.

248
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,460
Why don't you treat them some food?

249
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,490
You're the one who is hungry. I don't know why I should...

250
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,360
buy them food.

251
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,990
- Do you want me to? - Thank you.

252
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,730
- Do you want it? - Yes.

253
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,760
- All right! - Yes!

254
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,790
Let's go!

255
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,860
- Yes! - Joon Hyung is the best!

256
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,130
What's this? A dressing table?

257
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,590
Dad must've picked it up on a street again.

258
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,530
Why are you giving it to them?

259
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,490
I don't know if you'd like this popcorn or not.

260
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,730
Please help yourselves.

261
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,930
Wait. Excuse me.

262
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,860
Have we met before?

263
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,630
Weren't you on the weekend drama?

264
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,630
You're the patient next to the lead character in the hospital.

265
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:53,760
Gosh.

266
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,730
Yes. I think that's me.

267
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,760
That was me.

268
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,360
That was only a few scenes. You have a good eye.

269
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,190
I've never seen a celebrity before. This is amazing.

270
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,760
- He's handsome. - You're so handsome.

271
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,460
Celebrities aren't so special. We also drink, pass gas,

272
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,530
go to the toilet, and do everything normal people do.

273
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,890
Come on. You also look like a main character of a cartoon.

274
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,460
You can eat this all. Please eat up.

275
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,030
He called you a celebrity.

276
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:32,330
Dad. Where did you get the dressing table? Is it from the street again?

277
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,760
No, it's not.

278
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,630
You've been complaining that we don't have a big mirror.

279
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,960
Are you saying you actually bought that? You?

280
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,330
Of course I did.

281
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,730
I got it at a cheap price on the internet.

282
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,130
Gosh. You said athletes don't...

283
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,530
need a mirror. You're cold outside and warm inside.

284
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,930
What? I'm cold?

285
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,590
But warm inside.

286
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,860
I'm saying you're considerate, only pretending not to be.

287
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,330
Gosh. What are you saying?

288
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,130
Dae Ho. Here's the chicken. Go and deliver it.

289
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,760
I'm a celebrity that people recognize.

290
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,430
I can't be seen as a delivery guy now.

291
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,290
Dad, I'll deliver it. Where is the place?

292
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,330
- Your school. - All right.

293
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,490
I should... I should go instead.

294
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,460
My goodness.

295
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,160
It's been over 30 minutes since we ordered.

296
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,230
- Let's order at someplace else. - Why?

297
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,530
That place's chicken is delicious.

298
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:50,460
- You little... - It'll be here. Be patient.

299
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,730
I'm starving.

300
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,430
Did somebody order fried chicken from Bok Chicken?

301
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,290
Chicken delivery. It's from Bok Chicken.

302
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,830
- We did! - It's us!

303
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,460
Do you deliver chicken, too?

304
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,930
Fried chicken, spicy chicken, and teriyaki chicken.

305
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,330
- It'll be 38 dollars. - All right.

306
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,300
You do all sorts of things.

307
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,490
Can you do a part-time job and trainings at the same time?

308
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,800
It'll be 38 dollars.

309
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,630
Pay her already. She's waiting.

310
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,990
Chubs looks tired.

311
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,090
I should let her rest.

312
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,230
I'll try them first.

313
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,300
I'll pay you if they're delicious.

314
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,830
Why don't you take a seat over there?

315
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,190
Looking at a big person like you sweat...

316
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,730
makes me very worried.

317
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,360
Let's eat! Give me the drumstick.

318
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,460
- Okay. Let's eat. - Give me the drumstick.

319
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,430
- All right. Let's eat. - Okay.

320
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,460
It's my treat.

321
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,260
I owe you one, so it's my treat.

322
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,830
Enjoy.

323
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,690
- Well... Let's eat first. - Okay.

324
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,160
Where is it?

325
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,730
I should have paid her. Why did I put myself in trouble?

326
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,730
(Bok Chicken)

327
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,030
I found it.

328
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,760
You should go. It's time for the individual training.

329
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,830
All right. Go inside, Dad.

330
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:06,890
Dad?

331
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,030
That's right. This is from the delivery.

332
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,730
Didn't they pay with a card?

333
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,960
What? No. They paid with cash.

334
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,760
- I'll see you at the hospital. - Forget it. You don't have to come.

335
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,560
All right, Mr. Kim. Please go inside and get some rest.

336
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,300
- Bye. - I said go inside. Come on.

337
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,460
- Just go. - Fine.

338
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,260
She's a good daughter.

339
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,630
Do we have to ride this to the training center?

340
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,530
Why? Did our bus break down?

341
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,060
I guess so.

342
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,160
They didn't even tell us about it.

343
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,660
Hey. Forget it. We don't have time, so get in there.

344
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,800
- This won't work. - Gosh.

345
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,530
- No way. - It'd be so suffocating.

346
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,960
Be quiet.

347
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,890
Consider yourselves lucky.

348
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,960
Hyung Chul's great-grandmother passed away, so he's not here.

349
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,230
If that fatso was here... Gosh.

350
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:19,230
- Be thankful and get in. Come on. - That's a relief.

351
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,230
Coach Choi!

352
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,160
Guys!

353
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,360
Wait for me.

354
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,360
I took a cab here.

355
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,090
My mom said I don't have to go to the cemetery.

356
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,760
- Gosh. - That's...

357
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,690
Don't you have to go to the cemetery?

358
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,060
Get in. Hurry up.

359
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,690
- Let's go. - Hyung Chul.

360
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,860
- Yes, Ma'am. - Why didn't you go to the cemetery?

361
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,090
- My mom said... - Get in.

362
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,560
- All right. - Get in now.

363
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,830
- Let's go. - Hurry up.

364
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,930
- My goodness. - Oh, boy.

365
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,190
- Gosh. - Wait!

366
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,960
- Goodness. - Move a bit.

367
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,660
- Come on. - Quiet down.

368
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,360
All right.

369
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,430
- We can't go on like this. - Gosh.

370
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,060
- Don't come here! - Oh, dear.

371
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,300
- I'm good here. - Goodness.

372
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,360
Hey. Wait here. My gosh.

373
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,360
I can't take this any more.

374
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,490
Wait here.

375
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,090
Thank you, Sir.

376
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,060
Are you happy now?

377
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,060
(Weightlifting Team)

378
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,990
This is what I'm talking about.

379
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,230
This is surprising. They never do the things we ask for.

380
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,090
They reduced our operating costs by 30 percent.

381
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,290
What? That's absurd.

382
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,830
They already cut it by 10 percent.

383
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,160
That doesn't mean they can't do it again.

384
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,130
They can reduce it as much as they want.

385
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,830
They told me to cut down on our food expenses.

386
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,560
Why don't you go and throw a fit?

387
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,730
I can't believe they'd do this to us.

388
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:10,130
How can they expect us to feed the kids less food?

389
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,590
- They can't lift weights that way. - The kids are watching. Smile.

390
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,530
Professor. Hurry up.

391
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:19,290
Giving them less food will teach them a lesson.

392
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,530
It'll motivate them.

393
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,460
- Hurry up and get in. - Don't push me.

394
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,960
Why would he want to eat chicken?

395
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,130
Welcome. Please have seats.

396
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,360
Hey. You said you'll treat us lunch.

397
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,590
What? Why can't you eat chicken for lunch?

398
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,560
- Excuse me. - Yes.

399
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,960
We'll have 2 fried chickens and 1 spicy chicken.

400
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,990
Two fried chickens and one spicy chicken. Okay.

401
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:53,930
(Weightlifting Champion)

402
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:00,730
Let's go.

403
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,890
- How much is it? - Yes.

404
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,830
You had 2 fried chickens, 1 spicy chicken, and 3 cans of coke.

405
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,060
It'll be 46 dollars.

406
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,930
- Here you go. - Thank you.

407
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,290
Oh, right.

408
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,660
This.

409
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,230
This is what I owe you.

410
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,630
What? From when?

411
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:26,030
Well... About 2, 3 or 4 weeks ago?

412
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,560
Thank you for the food.

413
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,330
- Take care. - 2, 3 or 4 weeks? Hey, wait!

414
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,030
Chang Geol.

415
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,590
What's the matter?

416
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,160
I don't remember putting anything on tab for him.

417
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,260
He's saying I did.

418
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,260
Let's split it.

419
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:44,830
Gosh, I'm in pain.

420
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:47,990
Come here.

421
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,690
Good work today, everyone.

422
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,360
Go to a sauna and relax.

423
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,260
And don't forget to do some stretches before you go to bed.

424
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,530
Great work! You're dismissed.

425
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,460
Dismissed!

426
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,530
Good job, everyone. Go now.

427
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,530
Go, go. Bye.

428
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,660
- Let's go, Professor. We should... - Coach Choi.

429
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,760
Why are you guys just standing there? You're dismissed.

430
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,490
You two said that you'd take us out for dinner after today's training.

431
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,060
Dinner?

432
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:16,830
- Yes. - That's right.

433
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,830
- You said you'd take us out. - You said you'd treat us to a meal.

434
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,730
Did I say that?

435
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,360
- You did! - We clearly heard you!

436
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,130
- Don't back out now. - You said we'll eat barbecue!

437
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,530
You said you'd treat us to barbecue!

438
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,530
- All right. All right. - You promised us.

439
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,960
- Seriously. - Let's do it. Let's go for dinner!

440
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,630
Since when burgers are the same thing as barbecue?

441
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,030
Who knows?

442
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:46,090
- Isn't this just a snack? - Hey.

443
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,030
This is a meal, and what you eat in between meals is called a snack.

444
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,630
You guys are so spoiled.

445
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,060
Give it to me if you don't want it.

446
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,160
- Give it back. - Thank you for the burger!

447
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,890
Hey, eat mine. I don't have any appetite.

448
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,560
It's okay.

449
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,160
Please don't worry, Professor.

450
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,060
You eat yours. Hey, you.

451
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,330
Hyung Chul, eat mine.

452
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:19,090
I ate instant noodles earlier, so I'm not hungry.

453
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,330
I'm really okay.

454
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,530
Don't worry. Just eat it. Eat it already.

455
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,060
Was there something wrong with the noodles? It's sitting in my stomach.

456
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,890
Shall I needle my finger to make it go down?

457
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,690
- Ouch, my stomach. - Guys.

458
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,030
Get up. Let's go.

459
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,260
Go where?

460
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,360
Those burgers won't give you enough energy to lift weights.

461
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,030
Let's go for barbecue. Come on.

462
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,530
- Sweet! - Nice!

463
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,160
- Let's go! - Professor Yoon.

464
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,360
- Let's go. - Come on, guys!

465
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,990
- Professor, you're the best! - Where are we going?

466
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,430
My feet are cramping.

467
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,130
My darling!

468
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:11,830
You didn't answer my calls. Where have you been?

469
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,290
Gosh, where did I leave my phone? Oh, right!

470
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,360
I left it inside.

471
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,760
I'm so forgetful.

472
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,430
You're still so gorgeous.

473
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,430
It's been a long time, my ex-boyfriend.

474
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,430
I know.

475
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:31,990
It's been a long time.

476
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,090
I guess the food in Taereung is good.

477
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,460
You look healthy and well.

478
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,560
They do have good food there,

479
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,530
but I decided to come back because I missed you.

480
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,830
If you're trying to sound me out, don't bother.

481
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,030
I'm at peace now.

482
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,990
I know. I was just kidding. I wanted to break the ice.

483
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,630
But I must say that I'm happy to see you.

484
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,490
I'm glad to see you looking well.

485
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,530
I have to go inside now.

486
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,930
Right. Okay.

487
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,560
I can say hi to you when I see you, right?

488
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,890
Of course. Ignoring each other would be uncool and childish.

489
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,330
See you.

490
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,160
Ouch, it's hot!

491
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,290
- Eat up. - You, too.

492
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,360
Eat quickly.

493
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,490
I'm going as fast as I can.

494
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:27,290
- We'd like 3 more servings of ribs. - No, just 2 more.

495
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,130
Girls, make sure to control your pace.

496
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,490
You know our routine, right?

497
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,530
Of course.

498
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,560
We have to eat BFN.

499
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,160
- That's how it should be done! - That's how it should be done!

500
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,160
- Awesome. - Awesome.

501
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,530
By the way, what does BFN stand for?

502
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:40,890
Gosh, Ye Bin.

503
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,630
I'm disappointed in you, Ye Bin.

504
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,060
Shouldn't you know the basics?

505
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,090
Okay, listen up.

506
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,830
When you eat at a barbecue place,

507
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:52,160
you get full quickly if you eat without a proper strategy.

508
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,360
We came up with BFN...

509
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,460
in order to reduce chances of such mistakes.

510
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,190
It lets you enjoy your meal to the fullest.

511
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,360
First.

512
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,930
(Step 1: Grilled Meat)

513
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,360
You eat grilled meat.

514
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,290
- Next is grilled marinated meat! - Grilled marinated meat!

515
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:14,490
(Step 2: Grilled Marinated Meat)

516
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,190
When you're getting a little full from the barbecue,

517
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,890
you have to order the must-eat item, fried rice!

518
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,330
Five servings of fried rice, please.

519
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,730
(Step 3: Fried Rice)

520
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:30,130
(Step 4: Naengmyeon)

521
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:34,160
The last step is cleansing the palate with naengmyeon.

522
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,560
It completes the authentic, perfect meal...

523
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,090
at a barbecue place in the most efficient way.

524
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,760
So what do you think, girls?

525
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,090
You got first-hand experience.

526
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,260
- We admire you. - We admire you.

527
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,560
You girls are so adorable.

528
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,930
Eat some wraps, too.

529
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,330
Coach Choi. You should eat, too.

530
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,960
We live to eat, you know.

531
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,230
Let's pig out today.

532
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,430
Wait. Take this box, too.

533
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,090
- Here. - All right.

534
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,730
Take out all the recycling.

535
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,290
My gosh. He startled me.

536
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,630
Oh, my goodness.

537
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,660
You silly. You startled me.

538
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,730
- You startled us. - What's up?

539
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,830
- I'm here. - My goodness, you silly.

540
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,530
I'm hungry, Mom.

541
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,060
You haven't eaten dinner yet?

542
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,230
I didn't have time.

543
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:30,360
- You lost weight. - Shall we get something delicious?

544
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,260
- That sounds awesome. - I'd love that.

545
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,590
- Let me take this out first. - Okay.

546
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,760
- Go help Dad. - Dad, wait up.

547
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,860
(Dear Joon Hyung)

548
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:17,060
(Merry Christmas! From Mom)

549
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,660
"From Mom."

550
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:55,290
Gosh, my pride is crushed.

551
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,960
I can't believe that was so close. I mean, I'm a professional swimmer.

552
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,660
Hey, I know that you went easy on me.

553
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,360
How dare you try to fool me.

554
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,830
You've gotten so daring, Joon Hyung.

555
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,460
Was it that obvious?

556
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,490
But I must say, you're better than most amateurs.

557
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,630
- I've been swimming regularly. - I know.

558
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,060
Aren't you a doctor? How can you be so athletic?

559
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,130
You're too perfect that you irk me.

560
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,230
You even know so much about classical music.

561
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,330
Hey.

562
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,490
You're so good at swimming.

563
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,160
Not really.

564
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,930
If I was actually good, I wouldn't get disqualified all the time.

565
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,460
What's up with him?

566
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,160
- Goodness. - Here.

567
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:01,560
Are you worried about it?

568
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,790
- Starting it, I mean. - Of course.

569
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:08,460
All I do is swim. I'm obviously stressed out about it.

570
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,760
Jae Yi.

571
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,060
If I didn't swim,

572
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,730
would I be an average college student?

573
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,360
Maybe I'd work part-time...

574
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,990
and go on backpacking trips for vacation.

575
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,630
Do you want to travel?

576
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:32,030
No, it's not that.

577
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:34,130
Swimming isn't going so well.

578
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,060
I feel restless.

579
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,890
You miss her, don't you?

580
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,730
Your mom.

581
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,130
Of course I always miss Mom.

582
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:57,530
- Our mom is great. - I'm not talking about her.

583
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:00,860
Come on, I'm not a child who misses his mom.

584
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:02,990
Let's go home.

585
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:10,530
(Haneol Sport University)

586
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,790
Professor, it's time to get up.

587
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:36,060
- Gosh. - Did you fall asleep here again?

588
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:39,160
You should sleep at home.

589
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,460
If you keep doing this, it'll become a habit.

590
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,460
I must have fallen asleep.

591
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,890
- You're here early. - Professor.

592
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,460
Why don't you two get back together?

593
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:53,430
- What do you mean? - I mean,

594
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:55,790
her signing as a guarantor for her friend isn't a sin.

595
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,290
How could you divorce her just like that?

596
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,290
You can't go on like this.

597
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,890
You drink a lot because you miss your children.

598
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:05,160
You pay a lot for child support, too.

599
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,260
Doesn't your wife only shop at expensive department stores?

600
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,890
- Why are you getting angry? - I'm not angry.

601
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:18,200
I'm saying this because it's so frustrating.

602
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,760
She's a little immature because she's still young.

603
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,830
Just because you're young doesn't mean you're immature.

604
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,330
I'm sorry if it wasn't my place to say this.

605
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,360
Don't spend your own money any more.

606
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,930
I'll figure it out within our budget.

607
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,430
Come on, you can't do it alone.

608
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,260
I'll make it work somehow.

609
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,760
You should sleep at home from now on.

610
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:44,530
Please, I beg you.

611
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:46,890
Take care of yourself.

612
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:48,990
Gosh.

613
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,090
Look at that. He has an upset stomach again.

614
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,990
I should have bought them already. It's so annoying.

615
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,430
What did women do to deserve this?

616
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,790
What are you praying for?

617
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:28,930
A gold medal?

618
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,430
It's none of your business.

619
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:36,560
You're right. Good luck with training, and don't get injured.

620
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,830
Why isn't he prying like usual?

621
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,560
Next.

622
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,200
Again.

623
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:56,090
I'm sorry for being late.

624
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,160
Coach Choi.

625
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:00,630
- What's that? - I brought some snacks.

626
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,700
Huddle, everyone.

627
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,700
What is it?

628
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,230
Didn't you already digest your breakfast?

629
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,360
Let's take a break for some snacks.

630
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,490
Ta-da.

631
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,200
Here, catch it.

632
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,030
- Thank you. - Let me have one.

633
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,590
Here you go, Professor.

634
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,590
No thanks.

635
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,760
Come on, I bet you didn't have proper breakfast, either.

636
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,360
I had some rice with soup.

637
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,830
When did you get the snacks?

638
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:27,860
- I... - Coach Choi.

639
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:31,230
It doesn't taste the same. Isn't it from the same shop?

640
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,830
I got it from a different shop. Doesn't it taste good?

641
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,530
- It's not good. - It tastes fine to me.

642
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,530
It's different.

643
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,200
- I don't like it at all. - Me, neither.

644
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,760
- It tastes strange. - It's bad.

645
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,830
The ham doesn't taste the same.

646
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:45,260
- It smells bad. - How different can gimbap get?

647
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,830
Just eat it.

648
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:49,060
You don't know how to be grateful.

649
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,430
- Thank you. - Thank you.

650
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,530
Thank you.

651
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,090
- Thank you. - Thank you.

652
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,130
Take your mark.

653
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,660
Keep it up. Keep going.

654
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:13,430
Move, move, move! Hurry up.

655
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:16,760
Come on, let's go.

656
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,890
Keep going.

657
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,430
You're almost there.

658
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:24,200
Stop the time.

659
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,490
Good job.

660
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,490
- Good job. - Hurry up.

661
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,660
Good job.

662
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,090
This might make me lose all of my hair.

663
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,560
- Do you want it? - Yes.

664
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:45,790
Joon Hyung.

665
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,890
I heard you were offered to be Tae Hoon's private training partner.

666
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:51,890
- What? - I heard you rejected it.

667
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,160
- Is that true? - What?

668
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,430
You're so impressive.

669
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,960
You even rejected an offer from a famous swimmer.

670
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,590
You should have taken it.

671
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,060
You could earn money by being his partner.

672
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,730
You could also travel abroad with Tae Hoon.

673
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:08,730
Wouldn't that be better?

674
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,490
Having high self-esteem can be a bad thing.

675
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,200
What a sociopath.

676
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,160
I'm sure he feels inferior to you.

677
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,660
Hey, are you okay?

678
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:38,560
Joon Hyung.

679
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,160
Yes.

680
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,290
What do you think?

681
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:46,890
Don't you think it's better?

682
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,360
I was thinking about suggesting psychotherapy to Joon Hyung,

683
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:54,460
but some athletes reject the idea of getting therapy.

684
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,360
Don't you have a knack...

685
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,790
for making people take your advice by being very friendly?

686
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,200
Give it a try.

687
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,490
It sounds like a command.

688
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,790
Come on, that doesn't look good.

689
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,760
I'll do it.

690
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,260
There you go.

691
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,160
What's going on?

692
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:46,360
- Were you the one who called me? - Were you surprised?

693
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,890
I was surprised to see him here for some coffee, but it turns out...

694
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:51,860
- that he wanted to see you instead. - No way.

695
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:54,360
I stopped by because I was in the neighborhood.

696
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,230
We already saw each other this morning.

697
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:59,630
What's wrong with seeing me again?

698
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,630
You two are something.

699
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,090
Why don't you make a film about brotherly love?

700
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,200
No, we're the opposite.

701
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,960
He's kind but unattractive,

702
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,030
and I'm bad but very charming.

703
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,260
- Let me put this over your mouth. - I'm sorry.

704
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:17,790
- Come here. - I'm sorry.

705
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,160
I gave it some thought.

706
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,490
How about seeing a therapist?

707
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,130
I know some well-known therapists.

708
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,130
You could get a recommendation.

709
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,760
Is that what you thought about all day?

710
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:37,090
You concern yourself too much.

711
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:40,060
It's better than not seeing anyone.

712
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,530
Many athletes see therapists, too.

713
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,790
Joon Hyung.

714
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,290
I understand, so text me when you get me an appointment.

715
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,460
I'll give it a try.

716
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,090
I'm glad you decided to do it.

717
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:57,760
Just give it a try.

718
00:41:58,530 --> 00:41:59,560
Okay.

719
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,700
Gosh, I didn't bring an umbrella.

720
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:07,590
Take this. I'll run.

721
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,860
It's not raining much. Let's share it.

722
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,660
There's no way.

723
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,290
See you again.

724
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,930
(Lost Dressing Table)

725
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,630
It looks very similar to mine.

726
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:41,490
(On November 16, someone took my dressing table. Please return it.)

727
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,630
Come on, Dad!

728
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:53,030
Why did you pick it up from the street? We aren't poor.

729
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,330
I really thought someone threw it away.

730
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:59,660
You're driving me crazy.

731
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,660
Why do you pick things from the street? We aren't a junk shop.

732
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,460
Fine, I'll put it back.

733
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,200
I'll put it back, okay?

734
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,130
What are you doing? You might pass out again.

735
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,930
Then what should I do?

736
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,960
Dae Ho went out to play pool.

737
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,700
Gosh, I don't know what to do about my dad.

738
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,630
Why did he bring this home?

739
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,630
Can it get rained on like this?

740
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:29,290
Darn it.

741
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,200
Gosh, hurry up.

742
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:48,630
Do you need a hand?

743
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,230
- Pardon me? - It looks heavy.

744
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,930
No, no. It's all right.

745
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:03,560
Let's go.

746
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,060
Gosh, thank you.

747
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:31,430
Which way are you going?

748
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:35,230
If you're going this way, I can walk with you.

749
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:37,560
I'm really okay.

750
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:38,960
Well...

751
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:40,890
People will badmouth me,

752
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:43,690
saying that a guy is making a lady carry this.

753
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:46,330
Sorry?

754
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:48,360
A lady?

755
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:01,290
Let me help you.

756
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:03,990
No, no. It's okay.

757
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:07,090
He has such a nice voice, too.

758
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:19,290
My crazy heart.

759
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,860
Calm down already.

760
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,260
He'll hear how fast you're beating.

761
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:43,760
You can put it down here.

762
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:06,190
Thank you so much.

763
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,060
It was on my way anyway.

764
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,090
Take the umbrella.

765
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:12,660
No, I'm just going over there.

766
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:14,130
Over there? It's not that close.

767
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:15,560
I'm going right there.

768
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,830
- Thank you. - No problem.

769
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:28,530
- Oh, this way. - Right, go on.

770
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:35,360
A lady.

771
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,660
A lady?

772
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:41,460
Lady?

773
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:44,690
He called me a lady.

774
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:46,990
A lady.

775
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:51,130
Yes, Lady speaking...

776
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,830
No. I mean, Kim Bok Joo speaking.

777
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,560
Hey, Seon Ok.

778
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:57,160
What?

779
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,160
(Emergency Medical Center)

780
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,630
Hey!

781
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:07,190
Woon Gi, are you all right?

782
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,730
Hey, are you okay?

783
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:12,890
- Hi. - Are you all right? My gosh.

784
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,330
Hey. Oh, no.

785
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:16,730
Are you okay? My goodness.

786
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,330
Nan Hee! Are you all right?

787
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:20,760
- I'm in so much pain. - Bok Joo, you made it.

788
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,360
- What is going on? - We're in so much pain.

789
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:24,660
Professor.

790
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:26,560
Hey.

791
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:28,590
Bok Joo, you're here.

792
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:31,730
They're okay. This is caused by the gimbap they ate.

793
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:34,760
It's mild food poisoning. They just need to get a shot.

794
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:37,230
I'm so relieved.

795
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:41,830
Professor.

796
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:43,330
You're missing a shoe.

797
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:45,890
Gosh, when did I lose it?

798
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,460
Aging is making me become forgetful. Hang on a minute.

799
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:50,660
What a disaster.

800
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:52,490
You must've been so scared.

801
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:55,930
We've been eating gimbap every day. What was wrong with it today?

802
00:47:57,790 --> 00:47:59,730
Coach Choi. It was from Elephant Snack House, right?

803
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:02,190
We should complain.

804
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:03,460
No.

805
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:06,130
It was me.

806
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:07,430
Pardon me?

807
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:11,790
I made the gimbap.

808
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,330
Everyone got food poisoning from the gimbap I made.

809
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:21,890
Gosh, I shouldn't have bought the things on clearance.

810
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:24,130
I feel so guilty.

811
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,960
I must've been out of my mind. Goodness.

812
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,860
I'm so stupid.

813
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:39,260
You're being such a crybaby.

814
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:41,230
- No. - You're acting like you can't walk.

815
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:42,830
- Lie down. - Gosh!

816
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:47,260
Oh, boy.

817
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,660
Seon Ok is totally fine.

818
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,990
How much gimbap did you eat?

819
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,860
Seon Ok has a strong stomach.

820
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,790
That country girl is used to eating anything and everything.

821
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:57,490
You must be feeling better.

822
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,490
You couldn't even talk earlier.

823
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:01,460
I think I lost some belly fat.

824
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,330
Oh, right. Bok Joo.

825
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:06,130
What do you mean Coach Choi made the gimbap herself?

826
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:11,130
- Was she trying to embezzle... - Hey.

827
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,030
Don't you know what she's like?

828
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:14,990
Watch your tongue.

829
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:17,060
Why are you getting mad at me?

830
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,560
I'm sick.

831
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,190
Why did she do that?

832
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:24,630
I can't figure it out.

833
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,630
Hi, Woon Gi. It's me, Bok Joo.

834
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:42,660
I'm sorry, Coach Choi.

835
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:46,530
- It's because I'm incompetent. - Please don't say that.

836
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:49,190
It's all my fault.

837
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,290
In order to save a little bit of money,

838
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,960
I bought expired ingredients.

839
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:56,230
I'm sorry.

840
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:58,060
No.

841
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:00,260
I should've secured the budget...

842
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:03,030
at all costs.

843
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,130
You guys should get some rest.

844
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:16,390
Professor Yoon and Coach Choi.

845
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,960
Don't forget to take the medicine.

846
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:21,760
Except for Bok Joo,

847
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:23,530
all of you should take tomorrow off.

848
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:25,030
Professor, we heard...

849
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:27,930
everything from Bok Joo.

850
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:31,990
We had no idea about the budget cut. We should've been more thoughtful.

851
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:36,660
You know I have a big mouth.

852
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:42,730
We had a meeting about this issue.

853
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,660
We'll only have a snack every three days.

854
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,530
We'll have either one row of gimbap or a burger.

855
00:50:57,990 --> 00:50:59,460
We also decided to buy some sausages...

856
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:01,890
with our own money to snack on when we're really hungry.

857
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:04,160
We'll get the medium size, not the large one.

858
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:07,030
We also agreed to use toilet paper and other supplies...

859
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:09,830
at our dormitory instead of the ones here.

860
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,530
And we'll only go out for dinner together after matches.

861
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:16,630
Bok Joo can get us 50 percent family discount at Bok Chicken.

862
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,430
That'd be all.

863
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:20,990
Gosh, these fools.

864
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,830
Hey.

865
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:26,390
Who said you can go ahead and have a meeting about it?

866
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,360
Shall I teach you guys a lesson?

867
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:32,330
We know that we spend the most amount of money on food and snacks.

868
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,790
We took it for granted and didn't think about the cost.

869
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:42,330
We'll be more thoughtful from now on.

870
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:45,390
And we'll work hard!

871
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,090
- We'll do our best! - We'll do our best!

872
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:56,660
All right.

873
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:58,790
It's...

874
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,990
This, too, shall pass...

875
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,790
and become precious memories.

876
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:06,760
It also motivates us to work harder.

877
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:11,090
Let's turn this around...

878
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:14,690
by doing a great job at the tournament.

879
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,730
- Got it? - Yes!

880
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,690
- You guys are confident, right? - Yes!

881
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:22,130
How many gold medals should we aim for?

882
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:23,890
- 100. - 200!

883
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,860
We'll aim for four.

884
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:28,790
Let's win three. Please, guys.

885
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:32,190
You guys better win medals.

886
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,160
Here. It's coffee I brewed myself.

887
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,260
The test is really long, right?

888
00:54:37,090 --> 00:54:39,160
It makes me want to throw up. It's like the college entrance exam.

889
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:43,930
It's a basic test I need for the counseling. Hang in there.

890
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:46,260
Let's talk after we get the result.

891
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:47,790
Okay.

892
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:52,130
Gosh. You're a promising swimming player.

893
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,930
The burden I feel is quite heavy.

894
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:58,530
- You have to finish it in an hour. - The whole thing?

895
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,430
- You can do it. - Are you serious?

896
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:03,790
- Begin. - That's impossible.

897
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:05,230
- Begin. - You must be kidding.

898
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:07,190
You have 59 minutes.

(Weightlifting Team)

900
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,760
Bok Joo. Are you done with the training?

901
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:17,360
Hurry up and come home. Your dad...

902
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:25,660
Dad!

903
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,360
Dad!

904
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:32,130
Dad! Dad!

905
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:36,260
What's this? I thought Dad was sick. Are you okay?

906
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:37,790
We tricked you.

907
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:41,430
Your dad pulled a trick to show you the new dressing table.

908
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:45,090
- Uncle! Dad! - What?

909
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:48,490
You wanted one, right? You said it yourself.

910
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:51,760
It's pretty. I like the color, too.

911
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:54,260
It looks classy. Is this expensive?

912
00:55:57,390 --> 00:55:58,460
Wow. It has a drawer.

913
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,230
It looks good.

914
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:02,690
- You're early, Dr. Jeong. - Is my patient here?

915
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:04,230
Not yet. You still have 10 minutes.

916
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:28,990
Of course.

917
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:33,890
He's so handsome and polite because he's a doctor.

918
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:38,690
Why does it make me so depressed?

919
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,730
What did I expect?

920
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:46,790
- Hey, Bok Joo. - Bok Joo.

921
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:48,730
What took you so long?

922
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:51,560
We can eat now.

923
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:54,290
Today's menu is pork stew, your favorite. Hurry up.

924
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:58,560
- Hey! - Let's stop dreaming, Bok Joo.

925
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,430
He's a doctor for goodness' sake.

926
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:04,160
- He's in a different class. - Hurry!

927
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,660
Bok Joo!

928
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:06,890
I'm coming.

929
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:09,390
- Hurry. - I'm hungry. Hurry up, Bok Joo.

930
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:12,130
I'm starving here.

931
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:14,130
- Come on. - I'm so hungry.

932
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:18,790
What are you doing, Bok Joo?

933
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:22,390
- Where are you going? - Where are you going, Bok Joo?

934
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,690
Thank you for calling J Weight Clinic.

935
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:28,830
At 5pm?

936
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:32,530
We'll make a reservation for you, then. Okay.

937
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:36,290
Ms. Kim Bok Joo.

938
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:38,630
Yes.

939
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:45,790
- Your next patient is here. - Okay.

940
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,260
Ms. Kim Bok Joo...

941
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,190
Aren't you...

942
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:55,830
- Yes. I met you a few days ago. - Right?

943
00:58:57,090 --> 00:58:58,230
Did you get home safe then?

944
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,160
Is your arm okay?

945
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:03,290
- I'm fine. - That's good to hear.

946
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,160
You carried such a heavy thing.

947
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:06,860
Are you here for a counseling?

948
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:09,190
Please sit down.

949
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:15,190
I guess we have...

950
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:16,360
a special bond.

951
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:20,930
Doctor.

952
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:30,590
Do you like Messi?

953
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:33,430
Excuse me?

954
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:37,460
Do you like Messi?

957
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:54,630
That's right. There are no men in my life.

958
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:57,190
The dean even offered a prize.

959
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:00,090
- Why didn't you come to my clinic? - Hey, Chubs!

960
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:03,130
- Am I a ghost? Talk to me. - Go away, you punk.

961
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:04,430
You're drunk. You might fall.

962
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:06,730
Your hand is always warm.

963
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:08,130
You don't even look like girls.

964
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:10,190
- Do you want a piece of me? - What is it?

965
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:12,560
- Run! - Did you fight because of me?
