00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,490
- Good.
- All right.

3
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,510
People ask me...

4
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,780
why I became a weightlifter.

5
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,810
My dad took me to a weightlifting stadium when I was 10 years old,

6
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,750
and I strangely liked the metallic smell of...

7
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,950
the barbell.

8
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,380
That's when I decided...

9
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:51,510
to become a weightlifter.

10
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,880
Kim Bok Joo from Haneol Sport University...

11
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,680
will now make the 3rd attempt to lift 115kg in the clean-and-jerk.

(HANEOL SPORT UNIVERSITY)

14
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,350
As a young player who made history,

15
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,050
I grew up with weightlifting.

16
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,710
I lifted and threw the barbell thousands of times,

17
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,950
and I cut out calluses on my hands hundreds of times.

18
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,080
I shed thousands liters of sweat...

19
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,280
and tears.

20
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,510
And...

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,780
I'm about to go on stage.

22
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,250
The third attempt of Kim Bok Joo of Haneol Sport University.

23
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,580
- Tell us about it.
- I told you already.

24
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,310
- What is it?
- Come on.

25
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,410
Here is your chicken.

26
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,480
Why can't you tell us?

27
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,580
Can we switch the channel?

28
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,280
Please don't mind me and enjoy the food.

29
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,510
- Don't mind him.
- Gosh.

30
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,780
Oh my goodness!

31
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,580

00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,580
Yes!

00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,980
She's my daughter.

35
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,880
- She's my niece.
- She's my daughter.

36
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,350
Thank you.

37
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,550
Great work. I'll see you at the Taereung National Training Center.

38
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,380
You're my role model. I'll work harder.

39
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,750
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

We're in the Olympia Swimming Stadium,

43
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,980
where the 35th Presidential Cup National Swimming Competition...

44
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,780
is taking place.

45
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,580
Group D is having...

46
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,580
the preliminary round of Men's 200m right now.

47
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,210
Take your mark.

48
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,950
In the fifth lane,

49
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,880
we have Jeong Joon Hyung from Haneol Sport University.

50
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,510
He's going at an amazing speed.

51
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,180
Could you tell us more about him?

52
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,580
He has great records in practice games.

53
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,080
He's a rising star.

54
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,350
Unfortunately, in the previous competition, he was...

55
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,450
- disqualified for a false start.
- As we speak,

56
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,280
Jeong Joon Hyung came in first...

57
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,350
in the preliminary round of Group D.

58
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,480
Let's look at his record.

59
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,880
He was 0.15 second faster than Choi Tae Hoon of Group A,

60
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,280
who has the fastest record in Korea.

00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,580
Coach, take a look at Bok Joo.

72
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,650
Bok Joo. That's right. Okay.

73
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,220
Keep it up. Look up.

74
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,750
That's right.

75
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,720
You should endure it.

76
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,650
Your leg at the back was shaking.

77
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,950
Maybe you don't have enough muscles.

78
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,880
You should do some extra workout.

79
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,720
Don't slack off and work out more.

80
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,480
That's it for the morning training.

81
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:28,910
Gather up.

00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,780
- Gather up.
- Gather up.

83
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,610
Yes. Good work.

84
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,580
As your professor, there's something I want to ask of you.

85
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,150
You see,

86
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,610
how you finish is as important as how you start.

87
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,980
When I was a player like you,

88
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,150
I always turned on and off the lights at the gym.

89
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,310
Why? Was I a bad player?

90
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,680
Of course not.

91
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,410
Personality is as important as the talent, and...

92
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,950
In short, don't forget to turn off the lights. Do you understand?

93
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,950
- Yes, Ma'am!
- Attention, bow.

00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,750

- Shall we?
- I'll see you later.

97
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,250
Okay.

98
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,810
Seon Ok. What's today's lunch?

99
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,580
Stir-fried pork, bean sprout soup, beans, anchovies, and yogurt.

00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,850
Wow, stir-fried pork?

- Awesome.
- Awesome. Let's have three plates.

Why do we have to do this every time there's an event? We're not slaves.

Based on the preliminary round records,

Jeong Joon Hyung is in the fourth lane.

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,580
we have Choi Tae Hoon.

00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,780
That's right. It's only the records of preliminary round,

125
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,680
but it'd still get on...

Jeong Joon Hyung in the fourth lane made a false start.

00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,050
Does this mean he is disqualified again?

134
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,280
That's right. He'll be disqualified.

You already are talking.

We have a favor to ask.

00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,510
Can you be Tae Hoon's private training partner?

A private training partner?

145
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,980
Tae Hoon doesn't like training in Taereung.

146
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,250
I think he needs some private training.

147
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,410
It's more fun to train with someone with similar records.

148
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,780
We'll be able to motivate each other.

149
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,750
It'll be a win-win situation.

150
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,820
It's my honor.

151
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,820
A nobody like me rarely gets to train with a world star like you.

But...

153
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,010
I have difficulty waking up early. We can't train in the morning.

I have to take all weekends off.

155
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,710
I'm sensitive to change, so I'd like us to train at my school.

- It's so heavy.

162
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,510
It's too much.

00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,410
Gosh.

Move.

166
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,850
- My hands hurt.
- We have to arrange them now.

00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,810
Those sly gymnasts.

181
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,150
They're so tiny. They're not worth our energy.

182
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,750
I knew it. That serves you right.

183
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,580
You deserved that.

184
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,280
How dare you bother us?

185
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,150
- I know.
- We're gymnasts.

186
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,310
I'm sorry. Can you pass me the ball?

187
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,410
That was so funny.

188
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,580
Gosh.

189
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,750
I'm sorry.

190
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,480
I failed to control my movement.

191
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,880
This is the last one.

192
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,050
I'm so tired.

193
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,510
Are you okay?

194
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,510
Are you all right?

195
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,010
Can you get up?

196
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,480
Look at that.

197
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,150
Those witches.

198
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:36,980
Look at her.

199
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,410
- That was hilarious.
- I thought it was a tsunami.

200
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,750
- Try getting up.
- Get up.

(HANEOL SPORT UNIVERSITY)

202
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,710
We just ate, but I'm hungry again.

203
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,050
- It's time for some sausages.
- Why do you have so many?

204
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,350
Give me one.

205
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,250
Cheer up, Bok Joo.

206
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,950
- It's just like stepping on waste.
- That'd be much better.

207
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,850
That was so embarrassing.

208
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,850
Should I drop out? Should I kill myself?

209
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,280
- Gosh.
- It's okay.

210
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,080
They'll talk about it for a couple of days and forget about it.

211
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,580
I don't do this often.

212
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,210
Have a sausage...

213
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,980
and cheer up.

214
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,310
Cheer up. She's trying so hard.

- You're so pretty, Bok Joo.
- You're so pretty, Bok Joo.

217
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:51,950
Stop it.

218
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,050
Do you want some sausages?

219
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,810
If you insist, should I try some?

220
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:57,980
- Of course.
- Yes!

221
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,010
You have so many. You're obsessed with sausages.

222
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,780
I love them.

223
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,410
How many do you have?

224
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,510
Gosh. Bok Joo.

225
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,580
- Are you okay?
- Are you all right?

226
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,650
Are you okay?

227
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,080
Gosh!

228
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,350
I thought her finger got cut off.

229
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:38,980
Are you okay?

230
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,210
I'm okay,

231
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,850
but my sausage died.

232
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,810
You should have slowed down and kept your eyes forward.

233
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,980
Do you want me to express my condolences or something?

234
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,510
What did you just say?

235
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,580
By the way,

236
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,810
have we met before? You look familiar.

237
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:00,880
Sorry?

238
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,150
I'm sure we've met before.

239
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,180
She's been in newspaper many times.

240
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,080
It's on the school bulletin boards, too.

241
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,210
Anyway, I'm sorry for your loss.

242
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,980
Please excuse me now.

243
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,680
Wait.

244
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,680
This might sound random,

245
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,010
but do you like Messi, by any chance?

246
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,310
Sorry?

247
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,050
It's nothing. I guess it was too random.

248
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,310
Well,

249
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,450
bye.

250
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,180
Go now.

251
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,580
Go ahead.

252
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,580
Be careful. Go.

253
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,550
He sounded so rude.

254
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,250
I should have made him pay for my sausage.

255
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,750
I think he's hot.

256
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,310
He's famous as a handsome swimmer.

257
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,150
No way. He looks completely ordinary.

258
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,050
He doesn't look any special.

259
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,710
Nan Hee, what were you saying about Messi?

260
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,410
Do you like Messi, by any chance?

261
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,210
It's a good tip.

262
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:18,110
Guys are attracted to girls who share the same interests as they.

263
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:21,010
Guys love sports,

264
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,880
especially soccer.

265
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,380
If a girl likes Messi,

266
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,780
guys want to have a drink with her.

267
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,950
That makes sense. Isn't that convincing?

268
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,680
You say such meaningless words in such a serious way.

269
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,710
Don't react. That's all meaningless.

270
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,780
Gosh, what?

271
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,810
Do you like Messi?

272
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,910
What a terrible day!

273
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,010
Wait.

274
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,210
Did he drop it?

275
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,580
He has such a weird taste.

276
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,780
Is he a pervert?

277
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,010
Were you nervous about the competition?

278
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,580
Your thighs are so stiff.

279
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,110
That's not it.

280
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,410
I was startled at a sausage.

281
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,780
A sausage?

282
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,150
It's nothing.

283
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,810
You're enjoying it, aren't you?

284
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,520
Hey.

285
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,550
I'm sorry,

286
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,310
but I don't feel anything.

287
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,580
That can't be true.

288
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,910
Don't thighs like this make your heart flutter?

289
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,210
I wish someone could make my heart flutter.

290
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,580
It's done.

291
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,580
Be careful today. Massage them before you go to bed.

292
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,580
Okay.

293
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,950
Thank you.

294
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,750
Wait.

295
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,050
Are you looking for something?

296
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,450
It's nothing.

297
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,020
Who else would know?

298
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,080
We gave you back all the laundry.

299
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,310
I ordered them from Canada.

300
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,520
Could it be...

301
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,250
those lumps?

302
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,280
- What do you mean?
- Those weightlifters.

303
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,350
Theirs break so easily, so they often use ours.

304
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,210
Our laundry once ended up in theirs.

305
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,880
- It might be...
- Hey, weightlifters.

306
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,780
Yes?

307
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,350
Come here.

308
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,650
You're freshmen, right?

309
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,280
- Yes.
- Yes.

310
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,150
Have you seen my tights?

311
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,980
Didn't it get mixed into your laundry?

312
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,110
No.

313
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,450
How can I trust you?

314
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,950
Hey, what are you doing to them?

315
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,580
- Bok Joo!
- Bok Joo!

316
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,280
- What's going on?
- Her tights went missing,

317
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,050
and she's assuming that we took it.

318
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,680
We really don't use their washing machine...

319
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,550
because they've lashed out at us about it.

320
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,410
Did you actually accuse them?

321
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,950
- Yes, I did.
- Do you have proof?

322
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,050
It's not like I made it up.

323
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,350
Do you have evidence to prove that these girls took it?

324
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,080
I don't have evidence, but they have history.

325
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,850
How many times did you girls sneak in and use our washing machine?

326
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:18,750
That's not enough to put anyone behind bars. You need evidence.

327
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,580
This is precisely why our society never improves.

328
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,480
Everything prevents ex-convicts from starting afresh with confidence.

329
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,480
Don't you dare bother my girls.

330
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,050
Got it?

331
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:33,910
Let's go.

332
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,410
- Bok Joo, you're the best!
- Bok Joo, I admire you.

333
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,410
You girls didn't even sync.

334
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,350
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

335
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,910
Hey, the fried chicken is here.

336
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,910
- Sweet.
- I'm so excited.

337
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,110
- Hey.
- Yes?

338
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,410
How can they accuse our girls of stealing their laundry?

339
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:08,020
Look at this. They were glaring at us like this.

340
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,450
What is wrong with those skinny girls? They give us so much trouble.

341
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,980
Our unfavorable memories with them go back a long time, you know.

342
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,350
You girls did an amazing work.

343
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,250
Keep up the great work.

344
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,310
- Okay!
- Okay!

345
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,520
Good job.

346
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,180
The space the gymnastics department is using as their practice room...

347
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,180
used to be a weightlifting room.

348
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,210
Was it during the Asian Games?

349
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,810
They got a gold medal and took over our space. Our seniors were so mad.

What's more?

355
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,080
At every track meet, guys compare us to them and humiliate us.

356
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,550
Do you girls remember last year?

357
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,410
That's nothing compared to Day of Goo Seul.

00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,210
Right, Day of Goo Seul!

I can quit weightlifting and say goodbye to resin if you want.

00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,020
I can wear makeup, too.

362
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,580
What is the problem, Joo Sang?

363
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,180
Is this what you don't like about me? Or is this the problem?

364
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,050
- Goo Seul, stop it.
- Why are you being like this?

365
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,180
Why are you...

366
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,210
There she is. It's you, isn't it? This girl is the one.

367
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,180
- Goo Seul, please!
- You witch.

368
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,450
You wagged your tail like a vixen and seduced him!

369
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,580
Lifting you up and down is a piece of cake.

370
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,210
- You witch!
- That's enough.

371
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,950
Goo Seul spent an entire year...

372
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,080
on coaxing that guy from track and field to go out with her,

373
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,550
and that girl in gymnastics snatched him from her.

374
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,650
Goo Seul ended up getting kicked out of the residence after that.

375
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,510
Ever since that happened, her performance has been bad, too.

376
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,880
I know. Everyone had high hopes for her before that incident.

377
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,850
Anyhow, those girls irk me so much.

378
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,410
- Bok Joo, we ate all the chicken.
- What? Oh, okay.

379
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,480
- Gosh, you're the best!
- Nice!

380
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,280
- Ouch, it's hot.
- This is the fourth chicken.

381
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,710
- It's the 3rd one!
- It's the 3rd one!

382
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,910
I'm sorry. I sincerely apologize.

383
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,580
Go ahead and stuff your faces with it, you fools.

384
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,250
- Why did you hit us on the head?
- That was mean!

385
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,510
- Then pay for it at least!
- You'll kill our brain cells!

386
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,680
Are you collecting chicken bones or what?

387
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,980
Hey, we only have 10 minutes left. Eat quickly!

388
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,010
- Hurry up.
- Oh, my goodness.

389
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,850
- Hey, why are you girls here?
- Hello.

390
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,850
- Good night.
- Okay. You, too.

391
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,980
Make him do the deliveries, Dad. I'll go to the hospital...

392
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,110
What is that? You found it on the street, didn't you?

393
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,910
Well... Someone threw out this rice cooker, but it looks totally fine.

394
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,210
It's clean inside, too.

395
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,550
It probably doesn't work. What are you going to use it for?

396
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,410
I can certainly find uses for this.

397
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,450
I can put chicken in here when I do deliveries to keep it warm.

398
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,950
Also, what is that thing called? That...

399
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,150
You know that you're not making much sense now, right?

400
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,180
Shut it. Just go back to your residence already.

401
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,250
Stop eating so much chicken. I don't want to talk to you, so just go.

402
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,280
And don't come back tomorrow.

403
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,810
What are you talking about? I'll see you at the hospital tomorrow. Bye!

404
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,650
- Come on!
- Hurry up!

405
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,150
Hey, be careful! You might trip!

406
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:25,180
Goodness! My cute daughter.

407
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,650
- Don't run. Just go like this.
- Just hurry up already.

408
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,950
- Oh, boy.
- Let's do our laundry.

409
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,580
It's time to do our laundry. Gosh, it reeks of sweat.

410
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,550
- What's the matter?
- What?

411
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,050
Well, I feel like I just saw something.

412
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,210
What are you talking about? I don't see anything.

413
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,810
Was I mistaken?

414
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,380
Let's go.

415
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,150
We'll start the evening roll call.

416
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,710
- All student leaders to the office.
- Have you seen my handkerchief?

417
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:10,310
What are you talking about randomly? Just organize your stuff.

418
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,780
Tidy up, please. Ki Seok will be here soon.

419
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,010
Gosh, where did it go? Did I leave it at home?

420
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,450
Hey, hurry up. He's in the room right next to ours.

421
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,910
You guys are in charge of the stairs, right?

422
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,080
Did you mop the stairs?

423
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,050
We did, of course.

424
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,110
You left in the middle of the match.

425
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,350
I wasn't feeling well.

426
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,210
Being disqualified is nothing to be proud of.

427
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,650
- I let our coach know.
- Right.

428
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,550
You don't care about things like comradeship and teamwork.

429
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,280
You only care about yourself.

430
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,580
I guess I'm at fault.

431
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,680
You guess?

432
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,310
You prick...

433
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,180
Ki Seok, what are you doing? Are you going to keep us up all night?

434
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,450
I'm coming!

435
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,180
Good night.

436
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,350
Can't he close the door?

437
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,110
Is he a sociopath or what?

438
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,450
Why is he always out to get you?

439
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:34,080
People either really like me or hate me, you know.

440
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:37,950
Would you like someone who is as cheeky as me if you were my senior?

441
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,780
You even understand your anti-fan. You're really something.

442
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,080
Aren't I too perfect? Even my personality is perfect, right?

443
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,710
Gosh, you're so very perfect.

444
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,450
Is that why you got disqualified again?

445
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,680
You're worse than me who came in fifth place.

446
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,180
Just give up already.

447
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,780
Hearing you swearing at me is actually making me feel better.

448
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:58,710
- You jerk. I'll teach you a lesson.
- Ouch, stop it.

449
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,210
Hey, get up. Let's go out.

450
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:05,450
We need to lift up our spirits.

451
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,880
The roll call is done. We can't go out now, you fool.

452
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,880
Hurry up. Oh, my. Look at this!

453
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,980
Min Young, it's been such a long time.

454
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,180
Hey, you look gorgeous today.

455
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,810
Girls, I'm here!

456
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:22,550
Hey, let's drink. Cheers!

457
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:29,910
You're a professional swimmer, right?

458
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,580
You have such broad shoulders.

459
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,080
I saw your photo on Hye Jin's social media page.

460
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:40,250
Well, can I have your number?

461
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,550
My mom took my phone.

462
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,480
My performance hasn't been good lately.

463
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,580
She thinks it's all because of girls.

464
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,510
Have a good time.

465
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,950
Hey, where are you going? Hey!

466
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:01,980
Gosh.

467
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:06,280
Joon Hyung. You're going to eat breakfast, right?

468
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,850
- I'm fixing you breakfast.
- I don't want too much food, Mom.

469
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,580
Where did it go?

470
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,850
- Good morning.
- You're up early.

471
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,950
- Get in. I'll give you a ride.
- It's okay.

472
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,180
I'll run and get some exercise, too.

473
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,750
Just get in.

474
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,810
You must be exhausted from the match yesterday.

475
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,580
You're just bringing it up now?

476
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,780
Mom and Dad probably wanted to talk about it but didn't say a word.

477
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,780
Everyone in our family loves to act cool.

478
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:47,980
We all know how upset you must be. Bringing it up is pointless.

479
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,980
Sure thing. I was so upset that I went out and partied all night.

480
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,780
I'll get going since I'm so uncool.

481
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:56,050
Let's see if your clunker can be as fast as me.

482
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,350
What are you doing? Follow me with your car.

483
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:04,310
Gosh, it looks like we've been too lax with you guys. Seon Ok.

484
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,150
What are you thinking? You've put on 2kg.

485
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:09,080
It's because I ate fried chicken last night.

486
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,950
Gosh, seriously.

487
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,010
- Don't laugh.
- If you guys pig out like this,

488
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:18,710
you'll regret it so much before the tournament. I told you.

489
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,450
For the Atlanta Olympics,

490
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:25,180
I had to lose 3kg because I had to change my weight class unexpectedly.

491
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,450
I starved myself and got rid of every drop of water in my body...

492
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,710
in order to shed the 3kg.

493
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:33,080
Even someone who is so disciplined like me had to...

494
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,450
- You guys!
- My goodness.

495
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:37,180
Try to manage your weight on a daily basis.

496
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,350
And eat less meat, please.

497
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,580
- Okay!
- Okay!

498
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,210
Professor Yoon!

499
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,110
- Hello.
- Hello.

500
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,710
- Hello, Sir.
- Hello, everyone.

501
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,010
Hello.

502
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,080
What brings you here?

503
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:51,380
Someone ordered chicken, and suddenly cancelled the order.

504
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,910
I thought the kids can use a snack.

505
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:55,710
Gosh, you didn't have to do that. I'm sorry.

506
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,450
What are you talking about? You're making me feel bad.

507
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,080
You're the one who made Bok Joo who she is today.

508
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,110
She was thinking about quitting...

509
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,650
because she's tall, and she has long arms and legs.

510
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,550
You encouraged her...

511
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,580
and told her that all she needs is affection towards weightlifting.

512
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,910
- I'm so grateful to you that...
- Everyone, applaud!

513
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,010
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

514
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,910
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the food.

515
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,350
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

516
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,950
- Thank you.
- Go on and eat.

517
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:24,810
Why did you come? I was going to go to the hospital later.

518
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,280
We have to do this once in a while, you brat.

519
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,310
They always make things comfortable for you.

520
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,280
Professor Yoon. Go on and eat.

521
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,810
I cooked very young chickens.

522
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:38,150
- They were not even fully grown.
- Thank you.

523
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,880
Bok Joo.

524
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,950
Since your dad is here, why don't you go to the hospital with him?

525
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:45,680
Evening training is an individual training anyway.

526
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,910
Go on.

527
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:48,950
Thank you, Sir.

I'm sorry, but I have to go out.

531
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,650
Jong Ki's father died. He's my friend from the army.

532
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,310
You know him, right?

533
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,550
- Of course I do.
- Okay.

534
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,150
By the way,

535
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,380
his father would be thrilled...

536
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,850
to see you in this glitter jacket.

537
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,650
Are you playing a nightclub singer this time?

538
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:46,480
I'll go and change.

539
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:49,880
How silly.

540
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,550
If he wants to be an actor, he should play better roles.

541
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:56,010
He's always an extra who doesn't even have a line.

543
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,110
Okay. That was great.

544
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,580
Good cycles, Joon Hyung.

545
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,080
Well done.

546
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,510
Ki Seok. You should work harder.

547
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,680
Gosh, I got a callus again.

548
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,150
Look at this. It's the wound of glory.

549
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,980
My goodness.

550
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,250
- You're back.
- Hey.

551
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,550
Do you have to do that in my room?

552
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,150
Gosh, it stinks.

553
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,750
Even if you color your nails, it will come off soon.

554
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,550
I don't know why you do that.

555
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,650
It's not coloring. It's called nail art.

556
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,480
Don't be ridiculous.

557
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,580
Remove calluses on your hands instead.

558
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:19,450
It will come off when you lift the barbell, and your hands will bleed.

559
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,750
Let her be.

560
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,150
She's just trying to impress the guy she likes.

561
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:26,210
Hey. Don't try to impress him with those.

562
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,750
Work on your inner beauty.

563
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,250
That'd be much faster.

564
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,710
We're a lot more charming than the girls in rhythmic gymnastics team.

565
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,480
We're nicer and more self-sufficient.

566
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:36,680
Not to mention...

567
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:39,110
our glamorous figure.

568
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,980
That's right. You have a glamorous figure.

569
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,310
- Awesome.
- Awesome.

570
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,310
You're such an optimistic girl, Bok Joo.

571
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:49,650
- You have high self-esteem.
- I don't know if it's self-esteem,

572
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,010
or vanity.

573
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,010
Nan Hee.

574
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,450
You're out. Get out.

575
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,680
Go to your room.

576
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,310
Where did it go?

577
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,810
- What?
- What?

578
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:04,380
The t-shirt I wore at the national games. It's not here.

579
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,310
It should be there. Look harder.

580
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,380
Where did it go?

581
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,110
Are you sure? You don't know where my t-shirt is?

582
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:14,180
No. I think I saw it when I was doing laundry.

583
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:15,910
Oh, no.

584
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,550
I won the gold medal in that. I need to wear it for the next game.

585
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:20,780
This is bad.

586
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,010
I can't find it.

587
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,950
It's not in my room, and everyone else hasn't seen it.

588
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,380
What are you going to do?

589
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,380
You always wear it for the games.

590
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,810
Gosh, I'm doomed.

591
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,680
I can't win a medal without it.

592
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,850
Maybe...

593
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,410
This is just an assumption.

594
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,550
Maybe the girls in gymnastics did it to get back at you.

595
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:46,150
They always blame us when their clothes go missing.

596
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,580
Maybe they did it to...

597
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,680
Bok Joo, it was just an assumption.

598
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,010
Don't you know that she acts first when she's angry?

599
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:58,710
- Bok Joo.
- Can't I make an assumption?

600
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,910
Did you say...

601
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,250
we did something to your t-shirt?

602
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,680
Do you think we took it?

603
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,650
- Didn't you?
- Are you crazy?

604
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:11,050
Why would we? It's too big for us anyway.

605
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,280
You think we took your clothes.

606
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,010
You can't find any proof,

607
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:18,250
- so you...
- We did it to get back at you?

608
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,480
She's driving me crazy.

609
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,210
- She thinks we're that childish.
- I know.

610
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,350
Do you have proof? You said what matters is the proof.

611
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,180
Yes. I'm here to find proof.

612
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:32,480
Let me search your room.

613
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,050
No.

614
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:36,950
Why should I let you do that? Why?

615
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,880
I must find that t-shirt. Move.

616
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,750
What are you doing? What's wrong with you?

617
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,810
It's my lucky charm. I have to find it.

618
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,580
- Gosh.
- I said no.

619
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,210
Move or you'll get hurt.

620
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,210
- Gosh.
- Move.

621
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,550
- What's the matter with her?
- Ouch.

622
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,580
- Get off of me.
- Don't push them, guys.

623
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,850
Hey, no pushing.

624
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,710
- Goodness.
- Are you okay?

625
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,380
What should we do?

626
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,780
My wrist.

627
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,380
(INFIRMARY)

628
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,550
Goodness.

629
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:19,050
Who said you can rest? Straighten your arms!

630
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,580
Get up, Bok Joo.

631
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,480
What were you doing? Are you a thug?

632
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,950
Are you really a human bulldozer like others say?

633
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,650
Why did you use your strength on a person?

634
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,310
No, Sir. I'm sorry.

635
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,880
Is that why you work out so hard? To beat up a person?

636
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,480
- But today...
- Don't make excuses.

637
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,850
You did something terrible and your excuse won't work.

638
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,480
Watch your behavior. We're strength athletes.

639
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:51,710
If you do something wrong, it'll put all of us in trouble. Do you get it?

640
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,380
Professor.

641
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,010
She hurt her muscle.

642
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,510
She'll have to rest for 2 to 3 weeks.

643
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,810
It's not like you to do something so...

644
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,850
I didn't do it on purpose.

645
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,480
She stopped me from going into her room, so I pushed her a little.

646
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,580
It's true. I didn't even use much strength.

647
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,920
I know.

648
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:28,980
Still, apologize to her.

649
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,950
Try not to be involved with the girls in gymnastics.

650
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,950
- Darn it.
- Professor.

651
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:40,050
He had to apologize to their coach so many times.

652
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,980
He doesn't want to make any trouble. Do as he says.

653
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,110
I'm sorry.

654
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,550
What did you say? I can't hear you.

655
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,250
I'm sorry. I said I'm sorry. Are you happy?

656
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,580
Well... I'm not sure.

657
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,550
I'll see how you behave...

658
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:07,010
and decide whether to forgive you or not.

659
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,450
Let's go.

660
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:14,080
Gosh, I hate them.

661
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,110
This is too upsetting.

662
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,310
Hurry.

663
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,550
Our bunk bed is still here.

664
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,810
It was such a long day.

665
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:06,850
It was all because of a stupid washing machine.

666
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,880
What are you going to do about your t-shirt? It's your lucky charm.

667
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,380
Gosh. Those witches in gymnastics.

668
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,880
My dad was right.

669
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,310
We can't do anything about the people we hate.

670
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,010
Hey!

671
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,950
You're pretty and popular, but that's not everything.

672
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,250
You should be a decent human being first.

673
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,280
That's right!

674
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:27,980
I know you have...

675
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,280
bad breath in the morning just like we do.

676
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,180
Don't be so cheeky.

677
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,010
We have bigger chest than you!

678
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,710
You've got nothing.

679
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,980
Nothing at all.

680
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,980
Gosh, it's so noisy. You're weightlifters, right?

681
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,780
No.

682
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,580
We're judo players.

683
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,110
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

684
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,750
Bok Joo,

685
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:58,050
if both Song Joong Ki and Kim Soo Hyun ask you out,

686
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,250
who would you choose?

687
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,810
Can't I date both?

688
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,380
Shame on you.

689
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,510
You want to have both meat and fish?

690
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,280
Can't I?

691
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,450
I've been always giving up mine to others.

692
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:13,680
It's nothing to fight over. Just look at the sky.

693
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:18,250
The weather is so nice.

694
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,350
- Nan Hee.
- Yes.

695
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,980
- Where's our fish jerky?
- We ate it all last time.

696
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,680
- We didn't.
- We need something to eat.

697
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,980
I didn't eat it. Stop suspecting me.

698
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,650
- I'm so hungry.
- Nan Hee.

699
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,420
You sound so guilty.

700
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,950
- Fine, I ate it.
- I knew it.

701
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:37,650
Joon Hyung, let's go out.

702
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,150
Let's go out.

703
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,150
The headmaster is in his room,

704
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,810
and Ki Seok is sleeping, too.

705
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:46,010
I don't want to. I'm tired.

706
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,880
Just an hour.

707

Let's play some games for just an hour.

708
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:52,450
- Please.
- Gosh.

709

Oh my.

710
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:57,580
It's not 2 hours or 3 hours.

711
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,450
It's just an hour.

712
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,920
Is it such a big favor?

713
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,450
I'm so sad.

714
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:07,080
Gosh, you're so annoying.

715

We were going to play some games. She just popped out.

I could just ask a girl out. Why would I steal girls' clothes?

Don't get me wrong. I just want to make use of them.

I'm so shocked that he's the one who did it.

887
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:56,550
Me, too. I feel bad that we blamed it on the girls in weightlifting.

888
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:58,780
They falsely accused us, too. Just pretend you don't know about it.

889
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:01,750
Don't show them that you feel apologetic.

890

Hush. Who's chatting right now?

No, you have to go lower.

Hey, pay attention to your feet.

- Did you see that?
- That piece of...

- Thank you.
- He's crazy.

900

That pervert.

901
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:33,410
- We have to go.
- That jerk needs to be punished.

Hey, let's go.

903
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:37,410
From now on, make sure you tell us first.

904
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:39,350
I can't believe it.

They say, it's easy to miss what's in front of you.

Are you hungry already?

911
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,380
Okay, all right. I'm sorry.

912
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:15,850
Why did that jerk have to show up right at that moment?

913
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:17,480
Should I transfer to a different school or what?

What should I do?

This was the only available room.

Let's have fun together.

Hey. Isn't she Song Si Ho, one of the prospects for the national team?

00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:24,450
She said that she'll be my roommate.

Get ready for a tough time ahead.

You said your name is Bok Joo, right?

Do you mind keeping the window closed?

932
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:45,080
I can't catch a cold as my bronchial tubes get inflamed easily. Sorry.

933
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,580
I keep the window open most of the time because I get hot easily.

934
00:55:57,110 --> 00:55:58,780
Hey, can you make some room in the closet?

935
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:01,450
It's so packed right now.

The pervert in the dormitory has been caught.

00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:41,210
It was the sly-looking man in the administrative office.

No, I have no idea.
