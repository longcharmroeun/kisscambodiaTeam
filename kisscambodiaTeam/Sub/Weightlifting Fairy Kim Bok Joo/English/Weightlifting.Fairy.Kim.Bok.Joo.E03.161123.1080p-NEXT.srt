- Your next patient is here. - Okay.

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,860
Ms. Kim Bok Joo...

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,490
Aren't you...

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,260
- Yes. I met you a few days ago. - Right?

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,530
Are you here for a counseling?

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,890
Please sit down.

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,060
I guess we have a special bond.

9
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,490
Doctor.

10
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,590
Do you like Messi?

11
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:50,560
Excuse me?

12
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,390
It's a good tip.

13
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,190
Guys are attracted to girls who share the same interests as they.

14
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,090
Guys love sports,

15
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,990
especially soccer.

16
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,430
If a girl likes Messi,

17
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,960
guys want to have a drink with her.

18
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,490
Do you...

19
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,130
like Messi?

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,130
By Messi, do you mean...

21
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,890
the soccer player?

22
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,790
Yes.

23
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,390
Yes.

24
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:27,930
That's right.

25
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,860
I love soccer players.

26
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,130
Among them, I'm a big fan of Messi's.

27
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,690
Sure. I like Messi.

28
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,060
He's an amazing soccer player.

29
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,030
He is of a small build but very persistent.

30
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,260
I know. He's really persistent.

31
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,490
That's what I love about him.

32
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,030
- Oh... I see. - Right?

33
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,090
He's also very handsome...

34
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,130
in a manly way.

35
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,630
Right.

36
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,660
Right.

37
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,760
Let's talk about soccer later.

38
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,460
Let's have a checkup,

39
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,730
Ms. Kim Bok Joo.

40
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,830
You don't need special treatments.

41
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,630
I recommend dietary and behavior therapy.

42
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,660
Don't seek immediate weight loss.

43
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,590
It's more important to lose weight healthily.

44
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,130
Give it enough thoughts. If you really want this,

45
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,560
come and sign up for a session.

46
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,960
(Why is the success rate of losing weight only 17 percent?)

Come and sign up.

51
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,290
Come and sign up.

52
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,190
(Episode 3, Let It Go)

53
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,860
Please choose a transaction.

54
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,190
When you enter the passcode...

55
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,360
(Remaining balance of 390 dollars)

56
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,130
What?

57
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,460
Why do I have this little?

58
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,730
Right, I bought my uncle's birthday gift last month.

59
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,090
Why did I buy him a jacket instead of a pair of socks?

60
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,530
The transaction is in progress.

61
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,730
What should I do?

62
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,290
I need 200 dollars more to sign up.

63
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,330
Shall I ask Dad to pay me in advance for working part-time?

64
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,730
Should I lie about getting shoes for weightlifting?

65
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,460
Okay, that's a great idea.

66
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,660
Shoes for weightlifting.

67
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,360
Shoes for weightlifting.

68
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,290
Don't forget to take all of your belongings with you.

69
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,060
(Daehan Bank)

70
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,460
Hey, Chubs.

71
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,530
Hey!

72
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,990
Why is she in such a hurry?

73
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,690
Oh, my goodness.

74
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,360
Look at her run.

75
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,990
That's definitely Bok Joo.

76
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,860
She hasn't changed at all.

77
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,660
Gosh, look at that.

78
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,390
It's taped everywhere.

79
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,730
The scooter will become green soon.

80
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,230
Let's just get a new one.

81
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,260
We've used it for 18 years. That's enough.

82
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,130
Why would we buy a new one when it works?

83
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,330
It's good enough to use for the next 10 years.

84
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,890
I haven't mentioned it before,

85
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,460
but it's so embarrassing to make deliveries with this piece of junk.

86
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,190
It's the same as riding...

87
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,890
an old mule.

88
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,760
Hey, Bok Joo.

89
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:12,730
What brings you here at this hour?

90
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,360
Just because... Is the scooter broken?

91
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,360
No, it fell over and a piece broke off.

92
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,660
Bok Joo, tell your dad to get a new scooter.

93
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,990
Look at this piece of junk.

94
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,760
Deliveries are important for a chicken restaurant.

95
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,100
Goodness, be quiet!

96
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,460
If you have any conscience, you can say that again after earning more.

97
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,460
You worked as an extra...

98
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,990
but didn't even get paid. Don't tell me what to do!

99
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,560
The boss was mean, so I couldn't help it.

100
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,760
I have no power to make any complaints.

101
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,060
That's why you should just focus on running this business.

102
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,690
Take your mark.

103
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,360
Okay.

104
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,790
Joon Hyung, there's no pressure. You did a good job.

105
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,860
Keep up the good work.

106
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,260
Good job.

107
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,060
That's right. That was great.

108
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,190
Okay.

109
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,190
That's right.

110
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,390
Point your toes more.

(Haneol Sport University)

112
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,930
Point your toes more when you jump.

113
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,460
Soo Bin, since you're flexible,

114
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,260
all you need is more accuracy, okay?

115
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,530
Keep your leg firm when you kick.

116
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,260
Keep up the good work. You're doing well.

117
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,360
Wrap it up. That's all for today.

118
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,830
Who weighed more than the standard?

119
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,030
Do some jump ropes.

120
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,230
You can't go home if you don't lose weight by today.

121
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,890
Attention.

122
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,760
- In 2, 3. Thank you. - Thank you.

123
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,160
Si Ho.

124
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,660
You aren't getting better than I thought you would.

125
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,690
What's the problem?

126
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,830
I lose balance during penche turns,

127
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,030
- but if I work on my leg muscles... - The problem isn't that simple.

128
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,390
Have you seen...

129
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,290
how Soo Bin is improving?

130
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,730
She improved a lot.

131
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,760
Speaking of which,

132
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,690
why don't you get some training in Russia during vacation?

133
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,360
- In Russia? - Yes.

134
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,990
It'll cost you some money,

135
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,390
but how you spend your winter season...

136
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,830
is very important.

137
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,390
Discuss it with your mom.

138
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,990
Okay?

139
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,730
Gosh, where's Bok Joo? I can't get a hold of her.

140
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,460
Maybe she's making deliveries.

141
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,660
Bok Chicken is making her work so hard these days.

142
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,460
- I hope no one's in the lounge. - Let's check.

143
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,860
Darn it.

144
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,330
Nice.

145
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,430
Goodness.

146
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,790
I got here first.

147
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,730
So what?

148
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,130
It belongs to the person who grabs it first.

149
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,090
Were you going to watch food shows again?

150
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,330
What's the point of watching them? You have to watch your weight.

151
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,460
Then why do you read fashion magazines?

152
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,960
You can't wear those clothes anyway.

153
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,230
She's right.

154
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,990
We don't read fashion magazines.

155
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,290
Bok Joo.

156
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,200
Where have you been? I've been calling you.

157
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,460
Shall we go to a sauna?

158
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,590
- Okay. - Let's go.

159
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,430
Gosh.

160
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,090
Do you...

161
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,060
- have any money? - Money?

162
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,700
I have about 20 dollars. Why?

163
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,390
I have exactly 11 dollars.

164
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,260
Do you want to order a pizza?

165
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,460
Forget it.

166
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:26,930
I want to get some rest.

167
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,700
Where are you going?

168
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,830
With coupons, we might have enough for a pizza.

169
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,390
I told you that she should have quit gymnastics a long time ago.

170
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,460
We even sold our house for her.

171
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,060
If we invest more money in her,

172
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,460
we'll have to move to a cheaper housing, okay?

173
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,630
What can we do now?

174
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,060
We sold our house to come this far. We can't give up now.

175
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,590
She's close to being the top.

176
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,930
Who wants her to be the top?

177
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,290
It's you. It isn't what Si Ho wants.

178
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,890
All of this is for her.

179
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,430
She's underweight, undernourished, and doesn't have her period.

180
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,090
I don't want to push my daughter this hard, either.

181
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,830
What's wrong with you?

182
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,160
Did you see a ghost or something? You seem so out of it.

183
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,830
It's because I remembered...

184
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,360
a question someone asked me yesterday.

185
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,760
What question?

186
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,190
One of my patients asked me...

187
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,460
if I like Messi.

188
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,090
Isn't that a soccer player from Argentina?

189
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,460
Come to think of it,

190
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,290
I always ask questions to my patients.

191
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,630
I haven't been asked a question in a while.

192
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,590
Especially about what I like.

193
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,090
You must have been quite surprised.

194
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,460
You don't usually talk about your patients.

195
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,460
Is she pretty?

196
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,160
I'm not sure.

197
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,190
I think she is.

198
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,460
Gosh, this is crazy.

199
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,090
What am I thinking?

200
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,890
There's no cure to being lovesick.

201
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,060
- Come back to your senses. - Bok Joo.

202
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,460
Oh, my goodness.

203
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,660
You might break her spine. Stop it.

204
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,230
Gosh, are you okay?

205
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,360
It's okay. I felt like I was bent in half.

206
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,290
You've been strange since yesterday.

207
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,360
Is something bothering you?

208
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,730
No, I'm just not feeling too well.

209
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:50,560
Are you putting on a show so that you can skip mountain climbing?

210
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,930
Something is fishy.

211
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,460
Right, the mountain climbing race is tomorrow.

212
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,730
I'd be flying around right now if I didn't have to worry about it.

213
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,130
Why does our school always schedule these things on Saturdays?

214
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,090
I'm going to go wash my face.

215
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,260
Okay.

216
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,090
Oh, Bok Joo. Hello.

217
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,660
(Weightlifting Department)

218
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,130
My gosh.

219
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,190
I must've really lost my mind.

220
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,160
Why haven't you signed up?

221
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,660
Gosh, he even talks now.

222
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,590
I'm broke,

223
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,260
and I have to go to my training. Please don't do this to me.

224
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,960
Why aren't you coming by to sign up?

225
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,690
Why on earth are you doing this to me? Please stop.

226
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,530
I must be going insane.

227
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:43,330
Stop. Don't smile. My goodness.

228
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,830
Stop hesitating.

229
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,130
- Just trust me and take my advice. - I'm going crazy.

230
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,830
Also, UV rays can be very harmful for women.

231
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,860
- You need to protect yourself. - This is how people become insane.

232
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,390
- Carry a parasol or an umbrella... - I'm losing it.

233
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
Okay?

234
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,590
Go away. Don't come near me.

235
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,430
I'm literally going crazy.

236
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,030
Stop drinking. It looks like you already drank an entire pack.

237
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,360
You're the best.

238
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,830
You actually came all the way here for your obnoxious ex-girlfriend.

239
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,790
You threatened me by saying that you'd wait here for me all night.

240
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,460
Did something happen?

241
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,030
Joon Hyung.

242
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,030
Were you born with a gold spoon?

243
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,530
Or were you born with a silver spoon in your mouth?

244
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,830
Gosh, I'm neither.

245
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:22,230
I guess you could say that I was born with a bronze spoon.

246
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,860
If I can be born again,

247
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,330
I want to be born into a rich family.

248
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,090
I want to have parents who can fully support me,

249
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,430
and I don't want to have any worries.

250
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,230
Even if I don't work hard and slack off all the time,

251
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,360
my parents will marry me off to a good family.

252
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,530
You know Pyeongchang-dong, right? I'd love to live in a fancy mansion.

253
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,530
A house with a beautiful garden.

254
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,760
Don't say things like that to anyone else. It makes you sound clueless.

255
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,630
Do you think I'm pathetic?

256
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,330
I'm desperate.

257
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,730
Do you know why you're unhappy?

258
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,760
It's because of the gap...

259
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,590
between what you want and your reality.

260
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,060
Try to be a little less greedy.

261
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,860
Let's go.

262
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,790
We can't be late for the roll call.

263
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,690
Your hand still feels warm.

264
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:53,290
We have to get some sleep for the busy schedule ahead. Let's go.

265
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,130
Even just thinking about mountain climbing...

266
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:10,190
is making me so upset.

267
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,330
Tomorrow is Saturday, yet we can't even sleep in.

268
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,060
I'd rather do more training.

269
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:17,190
- Girls in gymnastics aren't going. - Are you serious?

270
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,430
Goodness. Had I known that, I would've...

271
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,790
gotten into gymnastics.

272
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,230
That's not even funny.

273
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,860
Have some conscience, will you?

274
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,660
How about I lie and say that I have...

275
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,460
- pain in my hamstring? - That won't work.

276
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,560
Hyung Chul tried the same tactic, but it didn't work.

277
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,790
- He said he has hemorrhoid. - Goodness.

278
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,860
Hemorrhoid is nothing.

279
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,400
So many people in our department have it.

280
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,130
Bok Joo also had to go to a hospital because of it last year.

281
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,330
Hey, why are you talking about me all of a sudden?

282
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,630
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

283
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:48,830
It's like a medal to those of us who are in strenuous sports.

284
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:52,030
Anyway, we can't skip it unless we have serious injuries.

285
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,430
So many people tried to get out of it.

286
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,660
That's why the dean wants to give prize money to the winner.

287
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
Prize money?

288
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,590
How much is it?

289
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,960
Was it 300 dollars? I heard that it's the dean's own money.

290
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,330
It'll be like a little event.

291
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,990
300 dollars is more than enough to sign up for the program.

292
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,990
This is a chance for me.

293
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,930
It's a golden opportunity.

294
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,260
Then...

295
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,690
shall I climb that darn mountain as fast as I can?

296
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,190
- Yes, that's right. - Hey!

297
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,400
Wake up already.

298
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,030
All right, everyone. Let's do our chant.

299
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,360
Here we go. In 5, 6, 7, 8!

300
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:52,530
- Haneol Weightlifting Team - Haneol Weightlifting Team

301
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,560
- Power up and lift - Snatch, clean and jerk

302
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,530
- Haneol Weightlifting Team - Haneol Weightlifting Team

303
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,790
- We're the strongest - We're the strongest

304
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,860
- Just a minute, guys. - What is it?

305
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,590
- Someone's calling me. Be quiet. - You're ruining the fun.

306
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,090
- Ring, ring, we got a call - Ring, ring, we got a call

307
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,130
Who called?

308
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,330
- We heard that gymnastics team won - We heard that gymnastics team won

309
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,330
What?

310
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,860
- No, no, that's a lie - No, no, that's a lie

311
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,690
- The weightlifting team won - The weightlifting team won

312
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,690
We're so awesome!

313
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,560
Let's go, guys. Unload the bus.

314
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,630
Hurry up, guys.

315
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,560
All right. I'm glad that all of you are...

316
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,960
fully recovered from food poisoning.

317
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,360
Today's such a gorgeous day.

318
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,760
I know that you guys aren't fans of mountain climbing,

319
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,790
but this race is an important event.

320
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,290
- You know, right? - The peak is 338.2m high.

321
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,160
Yes. I'll be sure to win...

322
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,730
and make that 300 dollars mine. Then...

323
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,130
Then come to me, Bok Joo.

324
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,960
Then I...

325
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,090
Stay strong, Bok Joo. You can do it. You got this!

326
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,660
Then I will...

327
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,230
So what are you guys going to do? You have to do your best. Got it?

328
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,990
Listen. No matter how high the mountain is,

329
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,990
it won't be as grand as your dreams. You know what I mean?

330
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,990
What I'm saying is that this is nothing hard.

331
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,160
What's our biggest strength?

332
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,230
It's being trampling upon... Wait.

333
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,530
- What was it... - Ability to overcome obstacles.

334
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,560
Yes, overcoming obstacles.

335
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,790
We get back up no matter how harshly we're trampled upon.

336
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,460
Guys, I don't even expect any of you to win today.

337
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,690
I just want all of you to finish the race...

338
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,230
without giving up.

339
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:46,330
That's my goal as well as the challenge we must conquer today.

340
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,690
Got it? I hate it when people call us fat...

341
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,830
and assume that we'd be terrible at mountain climbing for that reason.

342
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,730
As you guys know, that's total nonsense.

343
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,860
Do not make me hear things like that ever again, okay?

344
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,900
- Yes! - Are you ready?

345
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,130
- Yes! - Good.

346
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,660
- Are you guys feeling passionate? - Yes.

347
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,060
All right! Go!

348
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,590
- Yes, go. - Hurry up, guys.

349
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:07,460
- Move, guys. Move. - Hey, Bok Joo!

350
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,560
Hurry up.

351
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,360
Let's go faster.

352
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,860
Hey, watch out.

353
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,230
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

354
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,830
- He's coming. - Ouch!

355
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,290
Joon Hyung, are you all right?

356
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,860
Hey, Ki Seok. Ki Seok.

357
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,360
Joon Hyung sprained his ankle while getting off the bus earlier.

358
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,330
I don't think he can climb any more.

359
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,990
- Really? Is it painful? - Yes.

360
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,030
- Let me see. - It's this side.

361
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,430
Hey, are you all right? Ki Seok, Ki Seok!

362
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,730
Are you okay? Hey, it was your left ankle.

363
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,160
Stop putting on a show.

364
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,060
Jeong Joon Hyung.

365
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,590
You better not get behind me and climb all the way to the peak.

366
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,130
The second you see the back of my head,

367
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,730
you and all of your peers will be punished. Got it?

368
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,960
- Yes. - Go.

369
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,290
- Keep climbing. - Okay.

370
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,660
This way.

371
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,690
- Hey, was I too obvious? - Yes, you were.

372
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,260
- Bok Joo, wait up! - I can't climb any more.

373
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,890
What's wrong with her today? Did she eat something weird?

374
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,630
I don't even know. I can't do this any more.

375
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,830
My gosh.

376
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,860
Hold on.

377
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,060
Hey.

378
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,030
The crazy guy is coming.

379
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,430
Tae Kwon. I'm going first. Good luck.

380
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,230
Hey. Wait.

381
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,790
I'm scared, too.

382
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,190
Frankly, I'm scared, too. Gosh.

383
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,460
Hey! Wait for me.

384
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,030
Hey, Chubs!

385
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,660
This is surprising.

386
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:36,630
Looking at your size, I expected you to give up.

387
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,360
I'm not sure if you have a strong will...

388
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,930
or physical strength.

389
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,390
Hey.

390
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,990
Am I a ghost?

391
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,290
Talk to me.

392
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,060
I have no energy to talk.

393
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:50,690
Go away.

394
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,060
Gosh. You're all determined.

395
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,660
Are you going to win the first place?

396
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,660
 SUBTITLES BY VIU N SYNC BY SA143 

397
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:02,760
Way to go, Bok Joo!

398
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,490
I'll give you energy!

399
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,490
Get up there, Bok Joo!

400
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,590
Wait for me, though.

401
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,360
One,

402
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,730
two,

403
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,830
- Good. - three.

404
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,760
Flip and kick.

405
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,760
Chubs.

406
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:50,690
Are you okay?

407
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,930
I just don't want to carry you in case you collapse.

408
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,860
You're not going to take care of me even if I hurt my back.

409
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,260
Should I call for a stretcher?

410
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,530
Just go.

411
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,890
Let's go!

412
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,630
What are you doing? Keep going.

413
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,260
- Gosh. - Move it.

414
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,390
My goodness.

415
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,830
Stop it!

416
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,730
- Let's go, Bok Joo! - Stop!

417
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,830
Bok Joo!

418
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,490
Hey. My gosh.

419
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,390
What should I do?

420
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,860
I'm so sorry.

421
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,860
- It wasn't intentional. - Gosh.

422
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,290
You seemed to be tired, so I just wanted to help you.

423
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:36,830
I just wanted to help.

424
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:41,160
I think someone will be here soon.

425
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,130
We're offering a prize, so they would be competing hard.

426
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,790
Shall we get ready, then?

427
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,830
Gosh.

428
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,330
Hey. I'm sorry.

429
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,360
You seemed so tired, so I was trying to help you.

430
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,530
What? Are you going to head-butt me again?

431
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,460
- Hold on to me. It'd be easier. - Gosh.

432
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,130
Hold on to me.

433
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,830
Come on.

434
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,460
Goodness.

435
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,260
Hey. Get on my back, then.

436
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,660
I made you fall, so I'll carry you.

437
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,130
I'll just hurt my back at worst.

438
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,130
Get on.

439
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,790
Bok Joo!

440
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,260
I'm hurt.

441
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,560
My knee hurts.

442
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,090
She won't look back at all.

443
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,730
So many have come already.

444
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,760
Well, they're athletes.

445
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,390
I guess they're competitive.

446
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,230
They offered a prize.

447
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,760
That's gone.

448
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,090
Bok Joo.

449
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,030
Let's get your ankle treated.

450
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,890
- You should put ice on the... - Get lost.

451
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,730
- What? - I said get lost!

452
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,660
We're not friends. We just went to the same school.

453
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,290
Why are you hovering being nosy?

454
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,360
Mind your own business.

455
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,030
You ruined everything.

456
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,490
Did she have to be mean like that?

457
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,430
Hey. What do you want to eat?

458
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,490
Jokbal? Bossam?

459
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:15,090
Should we have some beer with chicken, sausages,

460
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,760
and French fries?

461
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,990
The last one sounds good.

462
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,160
- Let's eat until we can't. - I'd like that.

463
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,130
Bok Joo. Which one do you want?

464
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:25,790
What? I don't have an appetite.

465
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:29,030
Gosh. Seon Ok. Did I hear her right?

466
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,960
Did she say she doesn't have an appetite?

467
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,890
What's wrong with you? You said your ankle is fine.

468
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:37,660
- You made it to the top. It's good. - She's right.

469
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,160
Hey.

470
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,690
It's our night out in a long time. Don't be like this.

471
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,060
Come on now.

472
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,230
Let's go, Bok Joo.

473
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:53,130
I'm hungry.

474
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,390
I'm so hungry that my stomach is flat.

475
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:59,260
Come on, Bok Joo. She won't stop.

476
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,260
Hurry.

477
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,830
Let's eat the things you just said. Be quiet.

478
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,890
How long do we have to put up with this?

479
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:11,830
- Cheers! - Cheers!

480
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,690
Drink up! I don't need anything else.

481
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,730
I have you guys.

482
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,360
That's right. Now you sound like yourself.

483
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,390
Bok Joo is finishing her beer. Awesome.

484
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,790
Bok Joo.

485
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,090
To your healthy weight loss.

486
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:31,930
Cheers.

487
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:37,630
- Hey. Slow down. You'll get drunk. - Gosh.

488
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,660
This is her third glass.

489
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,290
Bok Joo, she's drinking too fast.

490
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:44,190
What are you doing? Slow down.

491
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:47,160
It's fine. It's our night out in such a long time.

492
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:49,930
We won't get to drink for a while.

493
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,560
- Right? - Ouch.

494
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,560
I'm sorry. Hey, budge up.

495
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:58,090
Fine. All right.

496
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,360
Okay.

497
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,860
My gosh.

498
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,930
What should we do? She's doing it again.

499
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,130
Let's hurry and eat.

500
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:10,060
I'm going to take a selfie.

501
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,760
Have you talked to Joon Hyung?

502
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,560
He was disqualified. Is he okay?

503
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,560
He'll have a counseling with my friend.

504
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,260
Really? Gosh. That's a relief.

505
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,690
That's good. We were worried,

506
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,360
but we tried not to show.

507
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,860
Mental training is important to athletes.

508
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:39,160
- It will help him. - Oh, my.

509
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:42,460
Speak of the devil.

510
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,730
Hello, Joon Hyung?

511
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,730
Have you eaten?

512
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:50,930
We're having octopus... No, I meant pancakes.

513
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,230
I just ate dinner with Tae Kwon.

514
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,630
I'm not going to be late.

515
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,460
I know you miss me. Just wait a little longer.

516
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:03,730
I love you, Mom.

517
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,230
Is she your mom or girlfriend?

518
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:10,090
You're quite a mama's boy.

519
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,690
I am. I love my mom so much.

520
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:15,790
My goodness.

521
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,160
I love taking selfies

522
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:23,530
Taking selfies makes me pretty

523
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,060
What's wrong with you?

524
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,890
- My gosh. - Oh, boy. What should I do?

525
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,830
- I'm so sorry. - Goodness.

526
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,090
I'm sorry. My friend is drunk.

527
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,330
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

528
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,590
Do something about your drinking problem.

529
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,360
Let them be. They'll ruin the mood.

530
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,660
- Sit down. - Girls should just stay home.

531
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,890
Why are they drinking outside?

532
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:51,190
Hey. Don't bother others when you're drinking.

533
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,090
I can see what will become of you.

534
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,730
We'll be weightlifters.

535
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,890
Gosh. If you were my sister,

536
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:01,060
I'd shave your head and lock you up.

537
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,060
What did you say to my friend?

538
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,730
What?

539
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:08,890
I said what I wanted to say. Do you have a problem?

540
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,090
How dare you.

541
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,760
Look at that.

542
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,730
You're athletes.

543
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,960
No wonder.

544
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,290
That's enough.

545
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,260
Those losers don't know anything.

546
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,060
What did you say?

547
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,430
- Losers? - Losers?

548
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,960
Let's see who the real losers are.

549
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,960
- Gosh. - Bok Joo.

550
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,660
- Darn it. - Calm down. Calm down.

551
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:37,260
Hey. The girls here don't look so nice.

552
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,330
I'm tired. Let's just have a quick drink.

553
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,030
Come on.

554
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,930
- Gosh. - Don't get upset.

555
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,630
- Don't. - Look.

556
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:51,460
You're such cowards to talk about us behind our back.

557
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,260
Isn't she a weightlifter whom you went to school with?

558
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,760
- Stop it, let's go. - I can't believe this.

559
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,030
I don't want to fight with you. Just apologize and leave.

560
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,630
I already apologized. Get lost.

561
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:03,330
What did you say? How dare you being rude to me?

562
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:05,530
- Get lost. - I'm not getting lost.

563
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,290
- Stop it. - You are the worst.

564
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:09,260
- You're worse. - Stop it.

565
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,330
Gosh, what should I do?

566
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,690
- Stop it. - Get out of here.

567
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,630
- Gosh, he's so rude. - What?

568
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,160
You're not a woman.

569
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,790
- Then am I a man? - You're uglier than a man.

570
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,590
- Your face is worse. - Oh, my gosh.

571
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:26,430
- Don't look down on women. - Stop it.

572
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,730
Let me go.

573
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:30,560
- You're such aggressive women. - Hey, let's go.

574
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:34,360
Do you think I'll go easy on you because you're a woman?

575
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,090
Hey.

576
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:39,430
- Who cares if you're an athlete? - What does that have to do with it?

577
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,390
- You swore at us first. - Stop it.

578
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,660
My goodness.

579
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,030
She might even punch me.

580
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:48,130
Punch me. Come on, punch me.

581
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,430
How dare you?

582
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,660
You have a flat chest anyway.

583
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,290
You don't even look like a woman.

584
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,630
What? You punk!

585
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,130
- Hey. - Gosh.

586
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:07,190
- You punk, what did you say? - Let me go.

587
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,230
- Goodness. - Let me go.

588
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:12,490
You punks, I'm also a woman.

589
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:15,390
- I'm still a woman even if I'm fat. - Let it go.

590
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:17,960
- How dare you hit me? - Goodness.

591
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,690
Let me go.

592
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,990
- You, come here. - Goodness.

593
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:23,830
- Hey, stop it. - Just leave.

594
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:24,860
My goodness.

595
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,090
- Come on, stop it. - I'm sorry.

596
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,590
You'd better watch it.

597
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:31,530
- Don't stop me. - Come on, let's go.

598
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,130
They deserve to be punched.

599
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:35,230
Gosh.

600
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,860
Stand up straight. You need to sober up.

601
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,060
Have a seat over there.

602
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,330
Okay, I'm sober now.

603
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,390
I'm completely sober. See?

604
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,960
Put this on. It's cold.

605
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,990
What a mess.

606
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,590
I wanted us to have a good time away from school.

607
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,530
Those punks!

608
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,430
I'm sorry. I lost my temper again.

609
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:18,960
You should be careful. What if you got hit?

610
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,330
We're weightlifters, but they were still men.

611
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,930
They looked like punks.

612
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,860
They were being so rude.

613
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,890
You guys are a mess.

614
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,990
One likes to fight while the other is drunk.

615
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,830
I'm never letting her drink ever again.

616
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,800
Gosh,

617
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:39,160
I'm so cold.

618
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,260
I'm so cold.

619
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,560
Here you go.

620
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,930
Drink this and let it go.

621
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,430
Gosh, that was close.

622
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,090
I was close to punching a girl.

623
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,760
Be careful with your words.

624
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,730
They were gangsters, not girls.

625
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:58,260
I hate women who are aggressive like them.

626
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,630
Even if they were easy, I'd reject them.

627
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:03,360
- Are you being serious? - One of them was okay.

628
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:06,690
That's right.

629
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:09,530
Women like them can be attractive in a different way.

630
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:10,960
They may be tough at first,

631
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,360
but then they become submissive.

632
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,190
You know what I mean.

633
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,260
Do you know Kyung Shik?

634
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,490
His girlfriend is manly and has a big build.

635
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,330
Kyung Shik says that she's amazing.

636
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:25,930
Come on, be more specific.

637
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:28,590
Compared to skinny girls...

638
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,360
- Excuse me. - What?

639
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,230
Gosh!

640
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,330
Nan Hee, are you okay?

641
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,830
- Have you sobered up? - Yes.

642
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,530
I feel much better now.

643
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,990
She's sober now that she can talk. She looks better.

644
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,590
- Let's go. - Let's go.

645
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,190
I'm so tired today.

646
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,230
- Hey, you. - Gosh, I'm tired.

647
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,060
- Run. Let's go! - What?

648
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,230
- Run, run! - What's going on?

649
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,690
- Goodness. - What's going on?

650
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,930
Come on, hurry up.

651
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,960
- Run faster. - Stop right there.

652
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:10,230
Just wait until I catch you!

653
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,090
Come on, let's go.

654
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,800
How much more do we have to run?

655
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,460
You go that way.

656
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,300
- Gosh. - Go this way.

657
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,160
Come on, hurry up.

658
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:26,830
My goodness.

659
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,590
Where did those punks go?

660
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,630
Where on earth did they go?

661
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,130
Gosh.

662
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:36,230
What are you doing?

663
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,560
You guys go that way. Let's go this way.

664
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,830
- Why don't we go this way? - That's what I said.

665
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:44,230
- Come and follow me. - Gosh.

666
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:45,990
Again?

667
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:52,930
- They're leaving. - Let's go.

668
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,300
That must hurt.

669
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:10,690
Let's go.

670
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:13,960
Okay, let's go.

671
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,460
Hey, look.

672
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,090
Stop it.

673
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,630
All that running made me nauseous.

674
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,830
Is your ankle okay?

675
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,330
I feel a little pain, but it's okay.

676
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,730
Why did we run away?

677
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,760
I wonder why I ran away with you.

678
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:06,830
I must have lost my mind.

679
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:09,930
When did you get there?

680
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:13,960
Did you see what happened?

681
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,530
What?

682
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,230
Did you get into a fight...

683
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,490
because of me?

684
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,590
Why would I get into a fight because of you?

685
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,930
You may not know this,

686
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:32,130
but I'm not that loyal. I don't meddle in other people's business.

687
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,460
Stay out of other people's business while others stay out of mine.

688
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,190
That's my motto in life.

689
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:39,530
Then why did you run away?

690
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,890
Wasn't it because you got into a fight?

691
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,930
No.

692
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,660
I must have been too handsome because...

693
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,760
they kept giving me looks.

694
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:52,300
I understand that they were out to have some good time,

695
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,860
but all women were looking at me.

696
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,830
What?

697
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:01,130
I can't have a serious conversation with you.

698
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:06,830
Anyway, now that I ran for a long time,

699
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,230
I have less on my mind.

700
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,190
Thanks, friend.

701
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,060
You're welcome.

702
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,560
By the way, what was on your mind?

703
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:26,360
- Is it something complicated? - What if it is?

704
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,800
Should I tell you about it?

705
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,190
I don't think we're close enough to have a deep conversation.

706
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:36,460
I have to agree with that.

707
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,060
Let me ask you one question.

708
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,730
Has your personality changed,

709
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,630
or do I remember you in a wrong way?

710
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,890
Of course I have changed.

711
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:53,130
I can't survive in this world if I'm still that shy.

712
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,660
Be honest.

713
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,960
Aren't I more attractive than before?

714
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,060
Right?

715
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:05,690
Stop it, get that face away from me.

716
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,760
Your chin is too pointy.

717
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,430
Speaking of what's on your mind,

718
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,430
don't force yourself to come to a conclusion.

719
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,490
Based on my experience,

720
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,730
time solves everything.

721
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:41,830
Whatever.

722
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,460
Hey.

723
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,190
Bok Joo!

724
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,730
Come out now.

725
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:56,860
Why is he being so loud?

726
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,690
Why are you being loud so early in the morning?

727
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:09,730
What's that?

728
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,260
Dae Ho, what's that?

729
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,230
Can't you see what it is?

730
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,260
It's a scooter.

731
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:21,190
It's used, but it doesn't have much mileage.

732
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,830
It's as good as new.

733
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:25,960
By the way, I disposed our old scooter.

734
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,060
No one was willing to take such junk,

735
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,160
so I barely sold it for 100 dollars.

736
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:33,130
How did you get the money to buy this?

737
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:35,860
I complained to my boss.

738
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:38,430
I told him to pay me for the work I've done.

739
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,830
If not, I said I'll complain to the broadcasting station.

740
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:43,830
If you get on his bad side, he might not give you more work.

741
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:47,300
I don't even think I have the talent for acting. I'll just quit.

742
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:51,390
Whatever. I don't want to talk about it.

743
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:52,860
So? What do you think?

744
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:55,130
If you get on this scooter...

745
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:58,530
and ride it like this, you'll look so cool.

746
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,160
Uncle! I must say, you're so cool today.

747
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,160
You're super charismatic.

748
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,690
So?

749
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:11,090
I do like it.

750
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,490
Isn't it so shiny?

751
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,030
- Gosh. - Come on.

752
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,890
Let's just take a look. It'll be quick.

753
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:35,190
- Let's go inside. - We're running late. Let's just go.

754
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:36,660
- Hello! - Hello.

755
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,800
Let's just browse. We won't buy anything.

756
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:43,530
This must be a new model.

757
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,090
- Let's get matching shoes. - No, let's go.

758
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,590
- Why not? - Why should we get the same shoes?

759
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:49,790
I hate that. It makes me cringe.

760
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,990
Let's go. Come on.

761
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:52,990
Gosh, seriously.

762
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,060
Okay, all right. Let go of me, then.

763
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,290
- You won't get them, right? - No.

764
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:57,990
- Promise? - Yes.

765
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:00,490
Goodness, hey.

766
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:03,890
- Let's go. - Gosh, all right.

767
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:04,960
Come on.

768
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:07,660
- Let's go now. - Let's get matching shoes!

769
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,290
- Thank you. - I'll be back soon!

770
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:10,690
Gosh, what are you talking about?

771
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,460
That one would also look good...

772
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,330
on Joon Hyung.

773
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,260
It's certainly faster. It took at least five minutes less.

774
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,360
I know, right?

775
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,390
I must say, this new scooter is great.

776
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:57,990
Don't drive too fast, though.

777
00:44:58,130 --> 00:44:59,660
And be careful when you make a turn, okay?

778
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,430
Yes, Ma'am. Sure thing.

779
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,560
Thanks for giving me a ride, Dad. See you later.

780
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:07,160
Here, take this.

781
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:09,090
What is this?

782
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:12,590
You seemed so down the last time I saw you.

783
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,030
Don't spend all of your time on training. Be sure to de-stress, too.

784
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:18,260
Go out for delicious food with friends, and go shopping, too.

785
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:20,590
You should also go clubbing like other girls.

786
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:23,360
It's okay. I don't need this.

787
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,030
Gosh. Just take it, you silly.

788
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,290
I was thinking of getting a new scooter,

789
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:30,790
but your uncle got this for me.

790
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:32,960
Stress is bad for athletes.

791
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,690
Go out and de-stress. You have to.

792
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:38,190
Oh, right. Your uncle will visit the hospital from now on,

793
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:40,060
so don't worry and just focus on your training.

794
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:42,460
We don't get that many customers during the day,

795
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,760
so let's just do that. All right? I'm should get going now.

796
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:49,060
Dad.

797
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,030
Bok Joo, I'm rooting for you!

798
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:56,930
Bye!

799
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:12,960
Watch my parkour stunt!

800
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,390
You silly.

801
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,730
Gosh, here we go again. My shoulders are hurting so much.

802
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:23,530
Build more muscles unless you want it to be dislocated all the time.

803
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,460
I know, too. I'm just lazy, that's all.

804
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:31,130
My darling, you're the only one who's worried about me.

805
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:32,290
Get off of me, you idiot.

806
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:34,030
What's your problem? Get more of this!

807
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:36,960
You're dead! I'm going to catch you!

808
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:39,190
Come here. Come with me.

809
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:41,960
- You're so dead. - No! I have to pick up my package.

810
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,130
- What? Don't lie to my face. - I'm serious.

811
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:47,890
- Ouch! Let go of me! - Gosh, I'm not lying.

812
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:50,560
I'm expecting the swim trunk I bought.

813
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,590
Hey, you did more shopping?

814
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,190
- What? - Aren't you worried about your dad?

815
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:56,430
Can you keep on splurging like this?

816
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:57,590
Don't you worry, my friend.

817
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:59,930
They say that the rich never goes flat broke.

818
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:01,830
What's there to life, anyway?

819
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:04,230
You have to live today as if there's no tomorrow.

820
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:07,190
There's something for you.

821
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:10,260
Look at this. It says "Jeong Joon Hyung".

822
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,460
I'm not expecting anything.

823
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,260
It's actually a little odd.

824
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:16,630
There's no address written. All it has is your name.

825
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:41,630
(Korea Gymnastics Association)

826
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,530
Hey, Joon Hyung.

827
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:12,160
I guess you were practicing.

828
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:18,860
Here.

829
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,860
You figured it out.

830
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:26,330
You're the only person who'd send me things like this.

831
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:30,060
If I'm the only person, can you just keep them and wear them?

832
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:33,760
You do have a point.

833
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,530
I thought about keeping them for a very brief moment,

834
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,090
but I don't think I can accept this from you.

835
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:44,790
Okay.

836
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,290
I didn't know it'd make you that uncomfortable.

837
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:50,790
Point taken.

838
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:52,730
I better get going now.

839
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:14,230
No, you crazy wench.

840
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:16,960
You're really crazy if you sign up with this money.

841
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,160
All Dad does is worry about you.

842
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:22,990
He had to drive on that old scooter so many times to earn this money.

843
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:25,890
Bok Joo, don't do anything you'll regret.

844
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:39,490
Gosh, this is so boring.

845
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:41,630
We can't even have beer.

846
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:42,930
Have some conscience, will you?

847
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:45,590
Don't you dare talk about alcohol for the next little while.

848
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:53,460
- Girls. - Yes, Bok Joo. What is it?

849
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:55,630
From now on,

850
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,560
I'm going to train so hard.

851
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,490
You already practice hard enough.

852
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:03,190
- You practice the hardest among us. - That's right.

853
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:04,560
No.

854
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:06,830
I've been so lax lately.

855
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:09,360
I'm going to focus now...

856
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:12,430
and train a hundred times harder.

857
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:14,660
Wow, a hundred times harder.

858
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,390
Bok Joo might go to Taereung this year, don't you think?

859
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,530
Yes. Taereung will be a piece of cake.

860
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:21,460
- She'll win a gold medal. - Exactly.

861
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:27,090
I'm Kim Bok Joo!

862
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,990
I'm a rising star of weightlifting, Kim Bok Joo.

863
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,730
From now on, I'm going to focus on training!

864
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:36,030
Yes, I got this. I can do it!

865
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:39,230
Hey, we heard everything. Kim Bok Joo!

866
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:42,060
I'm a rising star of weightlifting, Kim Bok Joo. Got it?

867
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:43,430
- I can do it! - Gosh, keep it down.

868
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:47,060
That's right. It's not like I ever had a guy in my life.

869
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,790
I'm Kim Bok Joo! I'm Kim Bok Joo.

870
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:51,730
I'm sure this is just a fleeting happening.

871
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:54,160
Time will take care of everything.

872
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:57,860
I hope time flies by. I really do.

873
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:59,330
I'm Kim Bok Joo!

874
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:00,330
Fly, time. Fly.

875
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:17,090
Hey, Bok Joo. That's it. Focus on breathing.

876
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:19,090
Lift! Don't forget to breathe.

877
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,430
- You got this! - You're doing great, Bok Joo.

878
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,790
- Hold it. - Go, Bok Joo!

879
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:28,760
Gosh, that was awesome.

880
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:31,260
Bok Joo, you seem so determined.

881
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:33,360
Our team hasn't won a gold medal for a long time.

882
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,490
Let's root for her to win one!

883
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:38,230
- Go for it, Bok Joo! - You can do it!

884
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:39,360
You can do it!

885
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:42,360
- Gosh, I'm hungry. - I know that you're taller than us,

886
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,590
- but don't do this. - What? I can't hear you.

887
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:47,090
- For goodness' sake. - Hey, what do you girls think...

888
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:48,460
about me getting the double lid surgery?

889
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:50,790
- How do I look? - You look like a celebrity.

890
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:51,960
Park Myung Soo, that is!

891
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:54,030
Hey.

892
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:56,260
- How can you say that? - Are we not going to eat?

893
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:57,330
- Yes, I'm hungry. - I'm starving.

894
00:51:57,330 --> 00:51:58,660
Today's menu is omelet rice.

895
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,060
- Omelet rice, again? - Why again?

896
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:02,160
- I don't want it. - We had it last week.

897
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,830
- Hey. - Gosh, please!

898
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:05,260
Omelet rice is delicious.

899
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,590
Hey, celebrity. Take us out for barbecue.

900
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:07,890
- Yes, you should. - Thanks in advance.

901
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:08,960
- You girls! - Let's go.

902
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,360
- Let's go eat! - Let's go!

903
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,560
It looks like Chubs is in a good mood.

904
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:18,260
You have to join the national team when you're back from Russia.

905
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,760
Yes, of course.

906
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:21,890
Hey, Si Ho.

907
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:24,260
I'll come back in a bit.

908
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:25,560
Just talk to me now.

909
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:28,160
Okay.

910
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,190
Did you speak to your mom about it?

911
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,930
Yes. I don't think I'll be able to do it this time.

912
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:41,990
Why is that? Is it because you can't afford it?

913
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:43,560
Did she say that it's too expensive?

914
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,790
All right. That can't be helped.

915
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:50,530
I hoped you could come with us.

916
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:52,790
It's disappointing.

917
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:57,090
I know. It's disappointing.

918
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:04,260
- Hey, Mom. - Did you tell the coach...

919
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,590
you won't go to Russia?

920
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:09,030
Why did you decide it without discussing it with me?

921
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:12,390
If I did,

922
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:14,160
would I be able to go?

923
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:17,260
- What? - We have to pay for the lessons.

924
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:20,730
How will you afford the airfare, living expenses, and lesson fees?

925
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:22,460
Please, Mom.

926
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:25,360
Stop bluffing when you can't even afford it.

927
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,490
It makes me forget about how poor we are.

928
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:00,760
- It's Song Si Ho. - Is that Song Si Ho?

929
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:03,860
Why is she in the men's dormitory?

930
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:06,930
Where is she going?

931
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:11,190
Gosh, she startled me.

932
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,690
I get what you want to say, and I know what I did was wrong.

933
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,630
But don't do this to me.

934
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,030
It's not so hard to accept this.

935
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:30,430
You can wear them or throw them away.

936
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:33,690
I already gave them to you.

937
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:59,560
Do you like Messi?

938
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:08,530
What's the use of accepting freshmen?

939
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:10,860
When we were freshmen, we did all the cleaning.

940
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,060
Why are we taking turns to clean from this year? It drives me crazy.

941
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,460
We're just unlucky.

942
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,260
Woon Gi became the captain and changed the rule.

943
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:20,690
Let's eat first and let one of us finish this.

944
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:22,390
Rock, paper, scissors.

945
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:27,430
Gosh. Why is it always me?

946
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,330
Seon Ok. What's today's menu?

947
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:32,660
Braised short ribs, muksabal,

948
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:35,030
fruit salad, and yogurt for dessert.

949
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:38,490
Okay. Let it go, let it go

950
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:40,760
It should be "Let's go", you fool.

951
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,530
Let's go, let's go

952
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,730
- I'm done. I can't do it any more. - All right.

953
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:48,190
It can't be cleaner than this.

954
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:49,860
Let's go and eat the ribs.

955
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,490
All right. Let's go before the ribs run out.

956
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:55,760
I'll get there first.

957
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:00,260
Come to think of it,

958
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,430
I like Ronaldo better than Messi.

959
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:03,890
(From Doctor Jeong Jae Yi)

960
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:04,930
Have a good day.

961
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:07,830
(I like Ronaldo better than Messi. Have a good day.)

962
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:15,030
Sometimes, there're passionate feelings that...

963
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:16,230
time and reason...

964
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:19,190
can't help.

965
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:25,130
Hurry up, Bok Joo.

966
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:28,260
- Hey, we're here. - Bok Joo!

967
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,830
- Bok Joo! - Hey!

968
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:32,460
One day, a mayfly said this to a moth...

969
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:33,590
drawn to a flame.

970
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:37,060
"You know that flame is a trap set by humans."

971
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:39,930
"It's not like you only live for a day as I do."

972
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:42,630
"Why would you want to throw yourself at the flame..."

973
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:43,830
"knowing that you'll die?"

974
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:46,130
The moth said,

975
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:50,490
"The flame is too beautiful not to throw myself at."

976
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,530
"There is no beauty without pain."

977
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:57,490
Would this road lead me to a fire pit?

978
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:00,360
I'm a little scared,

979
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:03,360
but I'll go down this road.

980
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:17,930
I'll run to him.

981
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,060
Are you okay?

982
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:15,760
We're stuck.

983
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,090
Be careful.

984
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:25,560
Gosh. You even talk now.

985
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:27,430
I must be out of my mind.

986
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:55,290
(We thank Ahn Il Gwon and Noh Woo Jin for their appearance.)

987
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:07,430
(Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo)

988
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:09,360
Your hairpin is pretty. It looks good on you.

989
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,030
- Should we move to the bed? - Bed?

990
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:15,230
Jae Yi, you seduced a naive college girl again.

991
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:17,630
- Where have you been? - What are you up to these days?

992
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:19,790
If I asked, would you help me?

993
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:22,790
- Bok Joo is my roommate. - You think I'm a fool.

994
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:24,860
She's one of my patients. She is a cellist.

995
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,330
- Is she pretty? - She's quite pretty.

996
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:27,330
What are you doing here, Chubs?

997
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:28,760
- He's my brother. - Brother?
