3
00:00:15,864 --> 00:00:17,864
My goodness. Look at them snuggling up to each other...

4
00:00:17,864 --> 00:00:19,864
when they're supposed to be training at school.

5
00:00:20,524 --> 00:00:23,364
Gosh. Their parents would be so upset if they knew about this.

6
00:00:24,094 --> 00:00:26,624
I wonder who their parents are. My gosh.

7
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:33,724
Wear your hood.

8
00:00:35,924 --> 00:00:37,094
Here you go.

9
00:00:42,964 --> 00:00:45,894
- What are they doing? - My goodness.

10
00:00:47,264 --> 00:00:48,624
Why are they doing that at school?

11
00:00:49,794 --> 00:00:51,964
Look at them hugging and kissing.

12
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:54,694
Get a room. Darn it.

13
00:00:55,064 --> 00:00:57,664
I hate to see that. I hope they'd trip on a stone.

14
00:00:59,494 --> 00:01:04,024
(Episode 14, This Girl Is Mine)

15
00:01:10,394 --> 00:01:11,694
You've decorated your house.

16
00:01:12,394 --> 00:01:15,064
- Yes. Aren't those paintings nice? - Yes.

17
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,964
I worked hard last year. Those are presents for myself.

18
00:01:19,924 --> 00:01:21,824
But it's been a while since I put them here.

19
00:01:22,494 --> 00:01:25,894
Gosh, come to think of it, you haven't been here for a while.

20
00:01:26,724 --> 00:01:29,494
I'm sorry. I've been very busy with some stuff.

21
00:01:29,494 --> 00:01:32,894
Not at all. It's good to have things to focus on.

22
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:37,324
I'm curious, though. What kept you so busy?

23
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:38,994
I'm just...

24
00:01:39,094 --> 00:01:42,024
meddling in other people's business.

25
00:01:43,224 --> 00:01:44,364
It's not that beneficial, is it?

26
00:01:46,364 --> 00:01:48,964
I think it's very beneficial.

27
00:01:49,764 --> 00:01:51,694
You look much happier and more comfortable.

28
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:54,524
I also feel some kind of optimistic energy from you. Am I wrong?

29
00:01:56,364 --> 00:01:59,464
You're right. I don't have ringings in my ears at all these days.

30
00:02:00,224 --> 00:02:03,264
I'm going to take a careful guess.

31
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:05,464
Are you seeing someone?

32
00:02:07,164 --> 00:02:08,194
Bingo.

33
00:02:09,094 --> 00:02:12,064
Dating is the most effective way to heal...

34
00:02:12,064 --> 00:02:13,294
your emotions. It sure is.

35
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:15,264
Doctor.

36
00:02:16,824 --> 00:02:18,564
You're a great doctor. I really admire you.

37
00:02:20,494 --> 00:02:23,524
My goodness. Good for you.

38
00:02:25,494 --> 00:02:27,864
Is your girlfriend pretty?

39
00:02:29,994 --> 00:02:30,994
She's just...

40
00:02:32,724 --> 00:02:34,664
To be honest, I'm too handsome for her.

41
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,664
Gosh, my back is sore now.

42
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,964
- She rejected me. - Do my feet stink?

43
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:44,764
My gosh!

44
00:02:45,394 --> 00:02:47,224
You two are so strange.

45
00:02:48,494 --> 00:02:49,564
When are you going to have lunch?

46
00:02:50,464 --> 00:02:52,194
I'm outside. I'll go to the cafeteria when you go.

47
00:02:52,194 --> 00:02:55,194
(I'm outside. I'll go to the cafeteria when you go.)

48
00:02:55,194 --> 00:02:56,264
At 12pm.

49
00:02:56,264 --> 00:02:59,494
(At 12pm.)

50
00:03:02,424 --> 00:03:03,524
Look at that.

51
00:03:03,824 --> 00:03:07,164
You're not supposed to get all romantic in our gym.

52
00:03:08,694 --> 00:03:10,194
You're so sly like a cat.

53
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:13,964
Did you think we wouldn't know if you kept it a secret?

54
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:17,824
You just can't take your eyes off.

55
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:19,964
Hyung Chul and Ye Bin!

56
00:03:21,964 --> 00:03:24,294
Goodness. Did something happen while I was gone?

57
00:03:24,294 --> 00:03:27,224
- What is this? Are you serious? - I knew it.

58
00:03:27,224 --> 00:03:30,524
When Hyung Chul collapsed, Ye Bin was shouting in tears.

59
00:03:30,524 --> 00:03:33,624
Gosh. While my hands and feet were numb with coldness,

60
00:03:34,064 --> 00:03:36,724
you were shooting a romantic film. I can't believe you!

61
00:03:37,364 --> 00:03:38,764
I feel so betrayed.

62
00:03:39,324 --> 00:03:42,764
When did they start seeing each other? What is this?

63
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,524
Please stop. Ye Bin didn't do anything.

64
00:03:46,194 --> 00:03:48,564
- I asked her out first. - That's not true.

65
00:03:49,324 --> 00:03:50,664
Hyung Chul didn't do anything wrong.

66
00:03:51,594 --> 00:03:53,294
I came on to him first.

67
00:03:53,794 --> 00:03:54,824
What are you doing?

68
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:57,724
- Look at that! - I can't believe this!

69
00:03:58,494 --> 00:04:01,164
Gosh, this is another shocking news after the whole fuss about...

70
00:04:01,164 --> 00:04:02,864
Coach Choi and Bok Joo's uncle.

71
00:04:03,224 --> 00:04:05,964
Ye Bin always said she felt lonely.

72
00:04:05,964 --> 00:04:07,324
She's finally dating someone.

73
00:04:07,864 --> 00:04:09,294
Hasn't Hyung Chul been saying...

74
00:04:09,294 --> 00:04:11,194
- his ideal type is Han Ye Seul? - Yes.

75
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:14,394
Your ideal type doesn't always match the person...

76
00:04:14,394 --> 00:04:15,524
you actually date.

77
00:04:17,664 --> 00:04:18,924
That's what I hear.

78
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:22,294
Anyway, I'm so jealous.

79
00:04:22,694 --> 00:04:25,164
Maybe it's because it's winter now. I see so many couples.

80
00:04:25,494 --> 00:04:28,964
Yesterday, we saw a gross couple fooling around over there.

81
00:04:30,824 --> 00:04:34,264
You two. Don't you ever betray me, okay?

82
00:04:34,764 --> 00:04:35,964
Especially you, Bok Joo.

83
00:04:36,464 --> 00:04:38,964
No way. Bok Joo would never do that.

84
00:04:39,294 --> 00:04:41,494
A guy put her through so much not so long ago.

85
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:44,094
She would be crazy to date another guy again.

86
00:04:45,024 --> 00:04:47,194
Of course. I'd be crazy to date guys.

87
00:04:47,494 --> 00:04:49,764
Okay. We all have been single our whole lives.

88
00:04:49,764 --> 00:04:51,564
I will kill you if any one of you betrays me.

89
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:53,994
- Being single is awesome. - Awesome.

90
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,024
Awesome.

91
00:05:00,994 --> 00:05:02,964
Gosh, I'm tired of these meatballs.

92
00:05:03,794 --> 00:05:04,794
I know.

93
00:05:04,794 --> 00:05:07,234
- Chubs. - Hello, hello.

94
00:05:07,564 --> 00:05:09,794
It looks like you just started eating. Why don't we eat here?

95
00:05:09,794 --> 00:05:10,794
Shall we?

96
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:14,624
It's been a while since I saw all three of you together.

97
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:16,864
When did you come back, Seon Ok?

98
00:05:17,064 --> 00:05:18,424
Yesterday. Long time no see.

99
00:05:18,794 --> 00:05:19,794
Right.

100
00:05:22,464 --> 00:05:23,494
I'm sorry.

101
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:53,624
Gosh, did my fingers get bigger?

102
00:05:58,564 --> 00:06:00,324
Joon Hyung, are you okay?

103
00:06:00,964 --> 00:06:01,994
Are you okay?

104
00:06:03,294 --> 00:06:04,364
Did you get hurt?

105
00:06:06,624 --> 00:06:09,294
It hurts. I think I got a bruise.

106
00:06:09,594 --> 00:06:12,094
Does it hurt a lot? Do you want to go to the infirmary?

107
00:06:12,264 --> 00:06:13,324
You're the one who hurt me.

108
00:06:13,564 --> 00:06:16,364
Why did you take my hand around our friends?

109
00:06:16,864 --> 00:06:19,424
What's wrong with that? We weren't doing anything wrong.

110
00:06:20,264 --> 00:06:22,024
Speaking of which, let's talk about it.

111
00:06:22,394 --> 00:06:25,394
I wanted to ask you why we should see each other in secret.

112
00:06:25,824 --> 00:06:27,794
Are you underage or married?

113
00:06:29,624 --> 00:06:30,694
Or...

114
00:06:31,294 --> 00:06:32,364
do I...

115
00:06:32,764 --> 00:06:33,764
embarrass you?

116
00:06:34,424 --> 00:06:36,264
It's not that.

117
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:37,694
Then why?

118
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,864
Will you break up with me after a little while?

119
00:06:39,864 --> 00:06:41,664
Do I embarrass you? Are you testing me?

120
00:06:41,664 --> 00:06:43,394
Don't say things like that.

121
00:06:45,094 --> 00:06:48,524
If my friends find out, they'll call me a traitor.

122
00:06:48,624 --> 00:06:51,594
After Dr. Jeong, I said I wouldn't ever see men again.

123
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:53,424
This makes me look nuts.

124
00:06:53,424 --> 00:06:56,194
Usually, you get over men by seeing other men.

125
00:06:56,194 --> 00:06:57,594
They don't know anything.

126
00:06:57,694 --> 00:06:59,794
I'm sure that it isn't the right time.

127
00:07:00,864 --> 00:07:02,594
Let's keep it a secret for now.

128
00:07:02,594 --> 00:07:04,924
Why don't we tell them when we get a chance?

129
00:07:05,064 --> 00:07:06,694
Okay, okay?

130
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:12,864
What are you doing?

131
00:07:13,194 --> 00:07:14,524
Are you trying to act cute?

132
00:07:15,594 --> 00:07:16,624
If not, forget it.

133
00:07:18,094 --> 00:07:19,164
Do it one more time.

134
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,264
Then I'll consider it.

135
00:07:27,264 --> 00:07:29,724
I can't do it again. Forget it.

136
00:07:30,664 --> 00:07:32,494
Come on, do it once more.

137
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,224
It's because it was so cool.

138
00:07:34,624 --> 00:07:35,994
Do it one more time.

139
00:07:37,394 --> 00:07:40,964
- What? - Act cute like how you did before.

140
00:07:41,224 --> 00:07:42,364
I couldn't hear you.

141
00:07:42,364 --> 00:07:45,524
Do it one more time. It was so cool.

142
00:07:45,524 --> 00:07:47,424
Do it one more time, please?

143
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:50,564
Please do it just one more time.

144
00:07:50,564 --> 00:07:52,194
Please?

145
00:07:55,064 --> 00:07:56,564
Oh, my goodness.

146
00:07:56,964 --> 00:07:57,964
You startled me.

147
00:08:00,194 --> 00:08:02,324
- Are you just getting off work? - Yes.

148
00:08:02,324 --> 00:08:03,864
I almost missed you.

149
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:06,594
Why didn't you call me in advance?

150
00:08:07,394 --> 00:08:09,324
I got two tickets to a concert.

151
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:12,864
Remember the CD of mine that you liked?

152
00:08:13,364 --> 00:08:14,424
The violinist came to Korea.

153
00:08:14,664 --> 00:08:16,724
I wanted to take you to his concert if you were free.

154
00:08:18,094 --> 00:08:19,094
Jae Yi.

155
00:08:19,564 --> 00:08:21,864
Actually, I'm not interested in classical music.

156
00:08:22,394 --> 00:08:24,594
I only pretended to like it because of you.

157
00:08:24,994 --> 00:08:27,164
I don't even remember that violinist.

158
00:08:29,164 --> 00:08:30,224
How about dinner?

159
00:08:31,664 --> 00:08:32,994
You need to eat anyway, right?

160
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,464
You didn't pretend to like steak when you don't, right?

161
00:08:55,094 --> 00:08:57,264
No, I do like steak.

162
00:08:57,594 --> 00:08:58,624
Really?

163
00:08:59,394 --> 00:09:00,394
Thank goodness.

164
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:02,564
Please go ahead and eat.

165
00:09:10,624 --> 00:09:13,064
Ah Young, what are you doing this weekend?

166
00:09:13,764 --> 00:09:16,864
If you're free, let's do something you want to do.

167
00:09:17,564 --> 00:09:18,624
Not what I want to do.

168
00:09:19,524 --> 00:09:21,194
No thank you, Jae Yi.

169
00:09:21,864 --> 00:09:24,364
I'm going to sleep this weekend. I'm tired these days.

170
00:09:24,894 --> 00:09:26,164
Shall I come to your house?

171
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,064
I'll make you spaghetti.

172
00:09:28,664 --> 00:09:31,764
You can go back to sleep after eating what I cook for you.

173
00:09:32,894 --> 00:09:33,924
Jae Yi.

174
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:35,924
Don't try too hard.

175
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:40,094
It could be worth it, don't you think?

176
00:09:41,264 --> 00:09:42,264
No.

177
00:09:42,594 --> 00:09:45,724
Trying hard won't make you fall in love with me after 10 years.

178
00:09:46,924 --> 00:09:48,994
You can't force someone to fall in love.

179
00:09:49,364 --> 00:09:50,594
I know based on experience.

180
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:08,724
Gosh, you guys.

181
00:10:09,094 --> 00:10:11,994
You're always here. Why don't you switch rooms with me?

182
00:10:11,994 --> 00:10:14,164
Getting rid of dead skin is easier in your room.

183
00:10:14,164 --> 00:10:16,524
Same here. For some reason, your room is more comfortable.

184
00:10:18,464 --> 00:10:20,294
- Is that made with potatoes? - Yes.

185
00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:24,064
Don't eat it. Yield it to the skin.

186
00:10:24,464 --> 00:10:26,994
It's made with flour, potatoes, and honey.

187
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:28,294
It's my special facial mask.

188
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,394
It moisturizes and whitens the skin right away.

189
00:10:35,994 --> 00:10:38,994
How do I look? Doesn't my skin look clear?

190
00:10:39,464 --> 00:10:41,364
Wow, your skin got so soft.

191
00:10:42,294 --> 00:10:43,464
Do you want to try it?

192
00:10:44,164 --> 00:10:45,834
I've never done it before.

193
00:10:46,494 --> 00:10:47,594
Shall I try it for fun?

194
00:10:48,194 --> 00:10:49,334
I'll do it for you.

195
00:10:54,764 --> 00:10:56,864
What's gotten into you, Bok Joo?

196
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:58,794
You were never interested in facial masks.

197
00:10:58,994 --> 00:11:01,194
It's about time that she changed.

198
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,524
If your skin gets clear because of the facial mask,

199
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,724
buy me a packet of sausages, okay?

200
00:11:06,964 --> 00:11:08,864
- Adjust it so that it fits. - Close your eyes.

201
00:11:09,094 --> 00:11:10,594
Take it off after 20 minutes.

202
00:11:11,324 --> 00:11:12,394
Don't fall asleep.

203
00:11:12,494 --> 00:11:13,694
- Hello. - Hello.

204
00:11:13,694 --> 00:11:14,694
Hello.

205
00:11:14,694 --> 00:11:16,824
How do you bother to do such a thing every day?

206
00:11:16,824 --> 00:11:18,624
- For how long? - 20 minutes.

207
00:11:18,624 --> 00:11:20,064
- Hold it still. - I'll do it.

208
00:11:20,064 --> 00:11:22,094
Make it fit on my face.

209
00:11:22,094 --> 00:11:24,064
Do you do it four times a week?

210
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,364
What is this?

211
00:11:31,464 --> 00:11:34,424
Your skin got so young that it's back to adolescent days.

212
00:11:34,864 --> 00:11:36,464
Why did you get a big pimple at your age?

213
00:11:36,994 --> 00:11:38,394
Isn't it because of that facial mask?

214
00:11:38,394 --> 00:11:40,494
That's strange. I never had any side effects...

215
00:11:40,494 --> 00:11:42,264
from the facial mask.

216
00:11:42,924 --> 00:11:45,964
You told me to yield it to the skin instead of eating it.

217
00:11:45,964 --> 00:11:48,564
Did you sleep with the mask on?

218
00:11:48,764 --> 00:11:49,994
Did you take it off after 20 minutes?

219
00:11:50,864 --> 00:11:52,464
I fell asleep,

220
00:11:52,564 --> 00:11:55,094
so I took it off in the early morning.

221
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:56,724
That's why, silly.

222
00:11:56,724 --> 00:11:58,994
Facial masks are effective only if you put it on for...

223
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:02,364
the right amount of time. Otherwise, it's not worth it.

224
00:12:02,564 --> 00:12:03,594
My goodness.

225
00:12:03,594 --> 00:12:06,624
How do I even go outside like this?

226
00:12:06,964 --> 00:12:09,924
It's not a big deal. It's not like you have a boyfriend.

227
00:12:09,924 --> 00:12:11,224
Hang in there for a few days.

228
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:14,094
It looks as if you got the pimple...

229
00:12:14,264 --> 00:12:16,464
because you didn't wash properly.

230
00:12:17,524 --> 00:12:19,794
Gosh, it seems dirty.

231
00:12:22,264 --> 00:12:24,264
- Let's go, weightlifting. - Let's go.

232
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,494
Hello.

233
00:12:26,494 --> 00:12:27,724
- Hello. - Hello.

234
00:12:27,724 --> 00:12:28,764
Hello.

235
00:12:29,894 --> 00:12:31,494
- Hello. - Hello, Bok Joo.

236
00:12:35,224 --> 00:12:36,894
Did you catch a cold?

237
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,464
Yes.

238
00:12:39,464 --> 00:12:40,494
Is it bad?

239
00:12:41,024 --> 00:12:42,224
It's contagious.

240
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:44,864
I'll call you later.

241
00:12:50,424 --> 00:12:52,824
You seemed fine yesterday. Are you very sick?

242
00:12:54,494 --> 00:12:55,664
Yes.

243
00:12:56,294 --> 00:13:00,194
I started to cough and got a fever last night.

244
00:13:00,424 --> 00:13:01,564
It's tough.

245
00:13:03,594 --> 00:13:04,994
I'm sorry to hear that.

246
00:13:06,094 --> 00:13:07,364
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

247
00:13:07,364 --> 00:13:09,324
When I have a cold,

248
00:13:09,694 --> 00:13:11,694
I cover myself in a blanket and rest.

249
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,064
Then I get better.

250
00:13:15,064 --> 00:13:17,224
I'll get some rest after training.

251
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:23,264
I don't think I can see you today because I'm sick.

252
00:13:24,264 --> 00:13:25,264
Okay.

253
00:13:25,964 --> 00:13:27,064
Take it easy.

254
00:13:27,694 --> 00:13:28,764
I'll call you again.

255
00:13:33,264 --> 00:13:34,524
Gosh, what am I doing?

256
00:13:34,524 --> 00:13:37,094
I can't see Joon Hyung because of this huge pimple.

257
00:13:42,524 --> 00:13:43,794
Hey, Bok Joo.

258
00:13:45,694 --> 00:13:47,964
You look like someone from the countryside.

259
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:50,394
One pimple is good enough to make you look silly.

260
00:13:54,424 --> 00:13:56,564
Rhinoceros, look away.

261
00:13:57,094 --> 00:14:00,364
I can't work out because you make me laugh.

262
00:14:03,764 --> 00:14:04,994
You look terrible.

263
00:14:05,264 --> 00:14:06,624
I have an idea.

264
00:14:06,864 --> 00:14:08,994
If you eat a lot of oily food, it'll get inflamed.

265
00:14:08,994 --> 00:14:10,294
Why don't you pop it when it does?

266
00:14:10,394 --> 00:14:11,594
That makes sense.

267
00:14:11,694 --> 00:14:13,664
Shall I touch it with my dirty hand?

268
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:15,164
You're annoying me. Go away.

269
00:14:15,164 --> 00:14:16,794
- Shall I put on some chalk? - Gosh.

270
00:14:18,964 --> 00:14:20,824
- It looks terrible. - Go away.

271
00:14:22,064 --> 00:14:23,764
You're being very considerate.

272
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:25,664
Who has a cold?

273
00:14:25,994 --> 00:14:27,664
You came all the way home to get medicine.

274
00:14:28,094 --> 00:14:29,364
It's a close friend of mine.

275
00:14:30,164 --> 00:14:32,394
- Do you know these are expensive? - Of course.

276
00:14:32,394 --> 00:14:35,494
I picked out the herbs myself to give them to you.

277
00:14:35,664 --> 00:14:38,094
- Tell your friend not to waste any. - Okay, thank you.

278
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:40,464
That's it?

279
00:14:40,994 --> 00:14:44,064
You haven't kissed me much these days.

280
00:14:44,524 --> 00:14:46,264
Do you have to be explicit?

281
00:14:50,394 --> 00:14:51,494
Ask Dad for the rest.

282
00:14:51,764 --> 00:14:53,264
- See you later. - See you.

283
00:14:57,694 --> 00:14:58,764
He's so cute.

284
00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:01,964
It's suffocating.

285
00:15:08,294 --> 00:15:11,294
I can't go to the cafeteria in case I bump into Joon Hyung.

286
00:15:12,094 --> 00:15:13,194
Goodness.

287
00:15:17,694 --> 00:15:18,864
Hello, Joon Hyung.

288
00:15:19,924 --> 00:15:21,294
You sound worse.

289
00:15:21,864 --> 00:15:23,064
Are you in your room?

290
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:24,994
Yes.

291
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,264
I'm in my room.

292
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:28,094
Come to the lobby.

293
00:15:28,764 --> 00:15:30,324
I brought medicine from home.

294
00:15:30,594 --> 00:15:33,224
What? No! No, I can't. I mean...

295
00:15:34,794 --> 00:15:36,864
I don't think I can.

296
00:15:37,964 --> 00:15:41,094
My legs are all wobbly because I've been coughing too much.

297
00:15:44,524 --> 00:15:47,564
Also, I don't want to get you sick.

298
00:15:47,564 --> 00:15:48,794
You're a swimmer.

299
00:15:49,594 --> 00:15:50,724
That doesn't matter.

300
00:15:52,024 --> 00:15:54,994
You sound so sick. Can you come down for just a few seconds?

301
00:15:55,224 --> 00:15:57,564
Well... I'm too sleepy right now.

302
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,394
I should get some sleep.

303
00:16:01,564 --> 00:16:02,564
All right, then.

304
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:05,824
Get some sleep. I'll call you later.

305
00:16:05,824 --> 00:16:07,224
Okay. Bye.

306
00:16:10,794 --> 00:16:14,094
Why did he go all the way home for me? I feel terrible.

307
00:16:16,694 --> 00:16:18,824
It sounds like her cold is getting worse.

308
00:16:20,494 --> 00:16:22,294
Taking medication before sleep will help.

309
00:16:34,964 --> 00:16:36,094
Can I pop this now?

310
00:16:36,524 --> 00:16:38,424
I don't think it has come to a head yet.

311
00:16:38,924 --> 00:16:41,224
What if I die from excessive bleeding while popping this pimple?

312
00:16:43,594 --> 00:16:45,924
Ouch, it hurts so much. What should I do?

313
00:16:46,624 --> 00:16:47,694
Gosh, whatever.

314
00:17:19,534 --> 00:17:21,224
You drive me crazy, Bok Joo.

315
00:17:22,194 --> 00:17:24,094
A pimple is no big deal. You didn't have to lie.

316
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:27,194
I was so worried about you.

317
00:17:27,624 --> 00:17:30,164
I even went home and brought special medicine made by my mom.

318
00:17:32,394 --> 00:17:33,424
I'm sorry.

319
00:17:34,624 --> 00:17:37,364
It actually looks a bit funny now that I'm seeing it from up close.

320
00:17:38,034 --> 00:17:40,394
Why are you trying to cover it? I already saw it. Don't bother.

321
00:17:41,224 --> 00:17:43,424
No, I don't want you to see it. I look so ugly now.

322
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:47,424
You're such a girl, Bok Joo.

323
00:17:49,064 --> 00:17:50,264
You're seriously so charming.

324
00:17:52,494 --> 00:17:54,394
This was fruitful, though.

325
00:17:55,724 --> 00:17:58,034
I finally get to see your room.

326
00:18:01,224 --> 00:18:04,324
It really is a girl's room. It feels different from my room.

327
00:18:04,824 --> 00:18:06,194
You have girly things, too.

328
00:18:06,624 --> 00:18:07,794
That's your ex-girlfriend's.

329
00:18:09,494 --> 00:18:10,494
I knew it.

330
00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:14,624
I was thinking it's not my style.

331
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,724
Where's your closet? Is this it?

332
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:22,034
No, no. You can't open it. I didn't organize it.

333
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,894
- No, no. - Come on.

334
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:27,164
- I'm messy, too. Let me see. - No, you can't.

335
00:18:27,164 --> 00:18:28,724
- No, no, no. - Hey. My gosh!

336
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:41,064
Hey, what are you doing? We can't do this.

337
00:18:42,764 --> 00:18:45,164
What are you talking about? I didn't even do anything.

338
00:19:06,624 --> 00:19:10,094
Bok Joo, the super supreme family size is here.

339
00:19:10,564 --> 00:19:12,264
Bok Joo, we're coming in.

340
00:19:14,664 --> 00:19:17,594
- What were you doing? - I was just stretching.

341
00:19:17,594 --> 00:19:19,394
- You must be hungry. Let's eat. - What is that?

342
00:19:19,664 --> 00:19:22,424
I've been craving this so much. Let's eat.

343
00:19:22,424 --> 00:19:24,064
No, eat it in the lounge.

344
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:26,724
I have a roommate, you know. I can't smell up the room.

345
00:19:26,724 --> 00:19:29,464
Those skinny gymnasts are there. We can just open the window after.

346
00:19:29,464 --> 00:19:31,994
- Since when did you care? - My goodness. You girls...

347
00:19:32,094 --> 00:19:33,824
Hey, sit here. This chair!

348
00:19:35,094 --> 00:19:36,094
- Sit here. - Okay.

349
00:19:36,624 --> 00:19:38,464
Don't dirty my blanket. It's so clean now...

350
00:19:38,464 --> 00:19:40,424
- because I just washed it. - My goodness.

351
00:19:41,624 --> 00:19:43,094
- What's with you today? - I'm cold.

352
00:19:43,094 --> 00:19:45,594
- Let's eat. - Pizza! Let's eat this pizza.

353
00:19:49,224 --> 00:19:51,624
- Doesn't this look so delicious? - Why can't you eat it in your room?

354
00:19:53,464 --> 00:19:54,494
Why did you have to come here?

355
00:20:19,264 --> 00:20:22,464
Hey, why aren't you eating? You're underperforming today.

356
00:20:22,594 --> 00:20:24,964
I know, right? She usually eats two pizzas by herself.

357
00:20:25,494 --> 00:20:27,594
- I'm just... - Is it because of that huge pimple?

358
00:20:28,424 --> 00:20:29,764
I'm just feeling a little queasy.

359
00:20:29,964 --> 00:20:31,824
Is it indigestion? Drink this soda.

360
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:36,264
I want it, too.

361
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:41,364
That's delicious.

362
00:20:42,264 --> 00:20:43,494
What are you doing?

363
00:20:45,924 --> 00:20:48,924
Girls! Seriously. Do you really have...

364
00:20:48,924 --> 00:20:51,064
to burp like that? You're disgusting.

365
00:20:51,294 --> 00:20:53,924
Who cares? It's just us. I thought it was about something else.

366
00:20:53,924 --> 00:20:56,564
You burp all the time, too. What's the matter with you?

367
00:20:56,794 --> 00:20:59,264
Hey, when did I burp?

368
00:20:59,264 --> 00:21:01,564
That's not everything. Even after running,

369
00:21:01,564 --> 00:21:03,164
she doesn't take a shower.

370
00:21:03,164 --> 00:21:05,264
Exactly. Even when she has to wash her hair,

371
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,994
she only washes her bangs.

372
00:21:06,994 --> 00:21:10,364
When did I do that? Take this pizza and go to your room.

373
00:21:11,724 --> 00:21:13,034
Hello.

374
00:21:13,224 --> 00:21:15,194
We'll finish this quickly and open the window.

375
00:21:15,194 --> 00:21:17,094
It's okay. Don't worry about me and take your time.

376
00:21:19,424 --> 00:21:20,494
This pizza is so good.

377
00:21:28,464 --> 00:21:29,494
My gosh.

378
00:21:39,324 --> 00:21:41,764
Girls. I'm sorry to say this,

379
00:21:41,764 --> 00:21:43,694
but I feel so tired all of a sudden.

380
00:21:44,824 --> 00:21:45,824
Can you guys finish soon?

381
00:21:46,564 --> 00:21:49,564
- All of a sudden? - She said we could stay.

382
00:21:49,564 --> 00:21:51,294
You're so erratic.

383
00:21:52,164 --> 00:21:53,764
Let's go. Bye, Bok Joo.

384
00:21:55,194 --> 00:21:56,264
All of a sudden.

385
00:21:57,924 --> 00:21:59,894
Bye, girls. I'm sorry.

386
00:22:01,994 --> 00:22:03,324
My goodness, you guys.

387
00:22:04,394 --> 00:22:05,424
Come on out.

388
00:22:10,764 --> 00:22:11,924
The night view here is amazing.

389
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,924
The view from here is better at night. I should've come here sooner.

390
00:22:16,594 --> 00:22:18,594
What have I been doing at school?

391
00:22:19,164 --> 00:22:22,094
- I didn't know so many things. - Now, you know.

392
00:22:23,294 --> 00:22:24,324
Thanks for earlier.

393
00:22:25,964 --> 00:22:28,724
Thanks, Si Ho. Ta-da!

394
00:22:29,094 --> 00:22:30,094
Is that your hiding place?

395
00:22:31,694 --> 00:22:34,264
Since you're offering it to me, I shall have a sip.

396
00:22:39,924 --> 00:22:41,694
- Cheers. - Cheers.

397
00:22:47,724 --> 00:22:48,764
It's so good.

398
00:22:49,664 --> 00:22:52,824
But the competition is around the corner, so I should stop now.

399
00:22:55,164 --> 00:22:58,464
Weightlifting and swimming is much easier than gymnastics.

400
00:22:58,924 --> 00:23:01,594
I wouldn't be able to live if I had to watch my weight like that.

401
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:05,424
You had to put on weight, which is more difficult to do.

402
00:23:05,494 --> 00:23:08,824
What are you two doing right now? I'm not used to this.

403
00:23:08,824 --> 00:23:12,024
What's the problem? We would've been so close if you didn't get involved.

404
00:23:12,694 --> 00:23:16,094
Si Ho. When is your competition? We'll be there to cheer you.

405
00:23:16,524 --> 00:23:17,524
This weekend.

406
00:23:17,924 --> 00:23:20,464
- Let's go. We should cheer her. - Hey, we can't.

407
00:23:20,864 --> 00:23:23,494
- It'd be great if we can be there. - We can't.

408
00:23:23,494 --> 00:23:24,924
Why not? It'll make Si Ho so happy.

409
00:23:25,094 --> 00:23:27,024
Gosh, I should head in now.

410
00:23:27,464 --> 00:23:30,524
I guess I stayed for too long. Don't stay out until too late.

411
00:23:32,164 --> 00:23:33,394
- Bye. - See you.

412
00:23:35,694 --> 00:23:37,094
Si Ho, are you not going to take that?

413
00:23:41,924 --> 00:23:43,924
Thanks to you, I got to hide in a closet today.

414
00:23:45,564 --> 00:23:47,524
We had quite a day today, didn't we?

415
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:50,694
By the way,

416
00:23:51,424 --> 00:23:53,294
- did you not wash your hair today? - Hey.

417
00:23:53,924 --> 00:23:55,764
That was only when I was too tired from the extra training.

418
00:23:55,764 --> 00:23:58,294
I'm usually very clean.

419
00:23:58,694 --> 00:24:01,564
- All right. I'll believe you. - Why do you sound so doubtful?

420
00:24:01,564 --> 00:24:03,824
- I am really clean. - Okay.

421
00:24:05,524 --> 00:24:08,324
By the way, until when do we have to hide it from everybody?

422
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:12,594
Let's keep it a secret just until the new semester begins.

423
00:24:13,294 --> 00:24:16,924
Especially your best friend, Tae Kwon. He's dangerous.

424
00:24:17,094 --> 00:24:18,624
Be careful, okay?

425
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,764
He's a nice guy. Are you badmouthing him or what?

426
00:24:20,764 --> 00:24:22,364
I'm just telling you to be careful.

427
00:24:22,364 --> 00:24:23,794
I'm always careful.

428
00:24:24,324 --> 00:24:26,394
- Are you getting annoyed with me? - No, I'm not.

429
00:24:26,394 --> 00:24:28,364
- I'm always careful. - Do you want to punch me?

430
00:24:28,524 --> 00:24:31,224
How could I punch you? You're too adorable.

431
00:24:35,394 --> 00:24:37,664
My gosh, don't say things like that!

432
00:24:37,724 --> 00:24:39,094
It makes you look too cute.

433
00:24:50,564 --> 00:24:51,624
There!

434
00:25:25,064 --> 00:25:26,094
Are you done with your training?

435
00:25:26,294 --> 00:25:28,064
(Are you done with your training?)

436
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:30,564
It just ended. I will call you when I go out.

437
00:25:30,564 --> 00:25:34,494
(It just ended. I will call you when I go out.)

438
00:25:38,864 --> 00:25:40,924
Joon Hyung. Joon Hyung!

439
00:25:41,224 --> 00:25:42,694
Gosh. What is it?

440
00:25:42,864 --> 00:25:44,424
Hey. It's an emergency.

441
00:25:44,424 --> 00:25:45,824
I need you to come with me now.

442
00:25:45,824 --> 00:25:49,324
- What? Come where? - I'll explain when we get there.

443
00:25:49,324 --> 00:25:51,094
- Come on now! - My gosh.

444
00:25:52,924 --> 00:25:54,564
Hey. Where are you going?

445
00:25:54,564 --> 00:25:56,864
What on earth are you doing?

446
00:25:56,864 --> 00:25:59,164
Listen. She suddenly called me...

447
00:25:59,164 --> 00:26:00,794
and said she wanted to see me.

448
00:26:00,794 --> 00:26:02,664
She told me to bring you as well.

449
00:26:04,464 --> 00:26:06,324
You just left the last time without saying anything.

450
00:26:06,324 --> 00:26:08,424
So Hee was so disappointed that you left.

451
00:26:08,524 --> 00:26:10,364
She would be upset if I don't bring you.

452
00:26:10,364 --> 00:26:11,894
Gosh, I just...

453
00:26:13,494 --> 00:26:14,794
- can't do this. - Look.

454
00:26:14,794 --> 00:26:17,194
How can I send away such pretty girls?

455
00:26:22,264 --> 00:26:25,394
Hi. Gosh, you look even prettier than when I saw you the last time.

456
00:26:25,564 --> 00:26:27,594
- Hello. - It's been a long time.

457
00:26:27,764 --> 00:26:29,324
Well, yes. Hello.

458
00:26:29,694 --> 00:26:30,764
Have you eaten?

459
00:26:31,364 --> 00:26:32,564
Did you guys order?

460
00:26:32,564 --> 00:26:34,294
He's the handsome guy from the swimming team.

461
00:26:34,824 --> 00:26:35,864
Hyung Chul.

462
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:37,394
What would you like to drink?

463
00:26:37,394 --> 00:26:38,964
- Coffee, please. - Me, too.

464
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,094
All right. I'll get it for you.

465
00:26:48,664 --> 00:26:50,164
What's going on?

466
00:26:50,624 --> 00:26:52,724
He said he'd call me when he goes out. Why isn't he calling me?

467
00:26:56,424 --> 00:26:57,864
Hello, Bok Joo.

468
00:26:58,424 --> 00:27:00,924
Hey. Where is your dear boyfriend?

469
00:27:01,024 --> 00:27:02,694
He went to the bathroom.

470
00:27:02,824 --> 00:27:03,924
He will be here soon.

471
00:27:05,294 --> 00:27:06,394
Oh, that's right. Bok Joo.

472
00:27:06,724 --> 00:27:10,194
It's about the guy from the swimming team who put a scarf...

473
00:27:10,364 --> 00:27:11,794
and a jacket on you.

474
00:27:12,394 --> 00:27:13,794
You mean Joon Hyung?

475
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:15,924
I guess you two are really just friends.

476
00:27:16,164 --> 00:27:19,524
I thought there was something between you and him.

477
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:21,824
He was on a blind date at a cafe nearby.

478
00:27:27,194 --> 00:27:28,194
A blind date?

479
00:27:28,924 --> 00:27:29,924
Yes.

480
00:27:31,924 --> 00:27:32,964
Where?

481
00:27:34,164 --> 00:27:36,724
Bok Joo. I'm starving.

482
00:27:36,824 --> 00:27:38,694
Why would you want to drink coffee?

483
00:27:38,694 --> 00:27:40,594
You don't even like coffee.

484
00:27:40,594 --> 00:27:42,224
And you can just drink from any cafe.

485
00:27:42,224 --> 00:27:44,424
Why do you have to go around looking for certain coffee?

486
00:27:44,794 --> 00:27:46,324
They all taste the same.

487
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:49,164
I can't do this. I should go in and eat some tteokbokki or something.

488
00:27:49,324 --> 00:27:50,864
Gosh, I'm so hungry.

489
00:27:52,724 --> 00:27:55,924
What? Aren't those Tae Kwon and Joon Hyung?

490
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:56,924
Where?

491
00:27:59,464 --> 00:28:02,294
She's right. They're obviously on a blind date.

492
00:28:02,294 --> 00:28:04,524
What are they doing? Those girls aren't even that pretty.

493
00:28:04,524 --> 00:28:06,294
We're much better. Let's go.

494
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:07,894
Let's go inside and watch them.

495
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:10,394
I think this place would make the best coffee.

496
00:28:12,364 --> 00:28:13,624
All right. It'll be fun.

497
00:28:22,094 --> 00:28:23,094
How spicy?

498
00:28:23,824 --> 00:28:24,964
I thought you liked spicy food.

499
00:28:30,594 --> 00:28:32,964
Hey, hey. Stop watching and eat first.

500
00:28:32,964 --> 00:28:34,294
Eating always comes first.

501
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:37,494
That's right. You should watch with your eyes, and eat with your mouth.

502
00:28:38,064 --> 00:28:39,624
Look at those girls.

503
00:28:39,724 --> 00:28:43,324
They're all dressed up. It means they're determined to allure them.

504
00:28:43,824 --> 00:28:45,194
Do you see that foxlike girl?

505
00:28:45,464 --> 00:28:48,594
I'm sure that she's after Joon Hyung.

506
00:28:48,724 --> 00:28:50,764
I'm not really good at this, but I think so, too.

507
00:28:50,994 --> 00:28:52,164
Look at her smiling.

508
00:28:53,094 --> 00:28:54,994
She's even touching him on the sly.

509
00:28:59,624 --> 00:29:01,994
You will die. I will kill you!

510
00:29:02,564 --> 00:29:04,364
You'd better finish up within five minutes.

511
00:29:04,364 --> 00:29:06,894
(You'd better finish up within five minutes.)

512
00:29:08,094 --> 00:29:09,494
- Look at you two. - Look at you.

513
00:29:10,694 --> 00:29:11,794
Do you like spicy food?

514
00:29:12,324 --> 00:29:14,024
I love spicy food.

515
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,564
I like eating extremely spicy food while sweating.

516
00:29:32,024 --> 00:29:33,624
- Look, Tae Kwon. - Yes?

517
00:29:34,794 --> 00:29:36,394
I think we should hurry up and go.

518
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:38,764
I just got...

519
00:29:39,524 --> 00:29:41,494
a text message saying all sophomores should gather up now.

520
00:29:41,494 --> 00:29:42,964
Gosh. What are you talking about?

521
00:29:42,964 --> 00:29:44,764
I'm the leader. I didn't get any messages.

522
00:29:45,524 --> 00:29:47,524
No. I did get a message just now.

523
00:29:47,524 --> 00:29:49,864
- Don't be absurd. - Hey!

524
00:29:50,424 --> 00:29:52,164
We're having a tournament soon.

525
00:29:52,164 --> 00:29:54,994
We should go now and practice.

526
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:56,694
I won't make it to the championship.

527
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:58,264
I messed up at the last tournament.

528
00:30:00,564 --> 00:30:02,594
He's just bragging about himself.

529
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:04,194
He sometimes messes up the start,

530
00:30:04,194 --> 00:30:05,424
but he's the ace of our team.

531
00:30:05,424 --> 00:30:09,364
No wonder. I thought he had the build of Michael Phelps.

532
00:30:10,664 --> 00:30:12,524
You have such broad shoulders.

533
00:30:13,364 --> 00:30:14,594
Why are you doing this to me?

534
00:30:16,324 --> 00:30:17,994
Your shoulders are so broad.

535
00:30:17,994 --> 00:30:20,294
- What are you... - They're just so broad.

536
00:30:29,924 --> 00:30:32,664
Get that filthy hand off of him.

537
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:35,624
Bok Joo.

538
00:30:38,324 --> 00:30:39,394
Who is she?

539
00:30:40,064 --> 00:30:42,464
I'm the girlfriend of the guy you just touched!

540
00:31:00,794 --> 00:31:03,094
I just can't believe this.

541
00:31:03,464 --> 00:31:05,624
I feel so betrayed, Bok Joo.

542
00:31:06,724 --> 00:31:07,894
What happened?

543
00:31:08,224 --> 00:31:09,324
Since when did you...

544
00:31:10,394 --> 00:31:12,464
It's not since we went to the amusement park, is it?

545
00:31:12,464 --> 00:31:14,894
No. We were just friends back then.

546
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,394
I had a crush on Bok Joo then.

547
00:31:17,464 --> 00:31:18,524
What?

548
00:31:22,164 --> 00:31:24,294
So since when did you start dating exactly?

549
00:31:24,564 --> 00:31:27,464
Yesterday? Last week? The week before that?

550
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:31,694
It's the day I came back to school. It was since then.

551
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:34,694
Then when we were on the hunger strike,

552
00:31:34,964 --> 00:31:36,094
he gave you a scarf and a jacket...

553
00:31:37,324 --> 00:31:39,364
I get it now. If I had known,

554
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:42,624
I wouldn't have been so jealous of her having such a sweet friend.

555
00:31:42,624 --> 00:31:44,424
I knew it.

556
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:46,724
He gave her such a significant look.

557
00:31:46,724 --> 00:31:49,324
Why did you keep it a secret from us again?

558
00:31:49,694 --> 00:31:51,694
You had many chances to tell us the truth.

559
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:54,864
I didn't want you to think of me as a betrayer.

560
00:31:55,294 --> 00:31:57,594
It also hasn't been that long since I made a fuss about a guy.

561
00:31:57,594 --> 00:32:00,094
We said it would be a betrayal, but we didn't really mean it.

562
00:32:00,094 --> 00:32:01,464
How could you secretly date him?

563
00:32:02,324 --> 00:32:05,194
Bok Joo is such a dishonest girl.

564
00:32:05,294 --> 00:32:07,224
She keeps lying to us.

565
00:32:07,224 --> 00:32:08,594
That's not fair.

566
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:11,194
You two kept pressuring her.

567
00:32:11,194 --> 00:32:12,494
- Bok Joo had no choice... - Hey.

568
00:32:13,324 --> 00:32:15,094
I guess you're siding with her as her boyfriend,

569
00:32:15,094 --> 00:32:16,664
but can't you see that it's not the time?

570
00:32:19,024 --> 00:32:20,024
All right.

571
00:32:20,764 --> 00:32:23,964
Anyway, I'm so sorry I didn't tell you, guys.

572
00:32:24,094 --> 00:32:26,724
- Saying you're sorry won't cut it. - Apologizing is not enough.

573
00:32:27,494 --> 00:32:28,664
What, then?

574
00:32:28,664 --> 00:32:32,024
Your boyfriend will have to pay for what you've done.

575
00:32:32,724 --> 00:32:33,764
Think of it as hazing.

576
00:32:34,824 --> 00:32:35,994
Hazing?

577
00:32:36,764 --> 00:32:38,694
Hey. Are they going to beat me up?

578
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:41,724
You took away our Bok Joo. You should treat us.

579
00:32:41,724 --> 00:32:43,894
Of course. I'd love it if you buy us meat.

580
00:32:43,994 --> 00:32:45,624
Meat? I see.

581
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:49,424
All right. If I buy you meat,

582
00:32:49,424 --> 00:32:51,564
are you going to forgive us?

583
00:32:51,794 --> 00:32:53,624
Can we now...

584
00:32:53,724 --> 00:32:55,924
see each other without sneaking around?

585
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,864
You shouldn't buy them meat.

586
00:33:08,764 --> 00:33:09,994
Let's go home, Coach Choi.

587
00:33:10,494 --> 00:33:13,464
Gosh, I feel so tired today.

588
00:33:13,564 --> 00:33:14,594
Professor Yoon.

589
00:33:14,864 --> 00:33:16,324
If you don't have any plans,

590
00:33:16,864 --> 00:33:17,924
let's have a drink.

591
00:33:18,694 --> 00:33:21,624
Can I take a rain check? I'm so tired today.

592
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,724
No, you can't.

593
00:33:23,924 --> 00:33:25,224
It has to be today.

594
00:33:27,764 --> 00:33:29,294
All right, then. Let's go.

595
00:33:34,364 --> 00:33:37,594
(Weightlifting Team)

596
00:33:37,694 --> 00:33:39,294
Gosh, you startled me.

597
00:33:40,494 --> 00:33:42,364
I'm right on time, aren't I?

598
00:33:42,364 --> 00:33:44,564
I thought you'd be getting off work around now.

599
00:33:45,694 --> 00:33:46,764
Let me take you home.

600
00:33:47,394 --> 00:33:50,394
I have something I want to talk to Professor Yoon about.

601
00:33:51,364 --> 00:33:53,964
I see. Are you going to have a drink?

602
00:33:54,764 --> 00:33:57,164
That's great. I wanted to have a drink with Professor Yoon, too.

603
00:33:57,694 --> 00:33:59,764
I'll just eat some food and take you home afterwards.

604
00:34:00,294 --> 00:34:01,364
Dae Ho...

605
00:34:02,594 --> 00:34:04,624
- Listen, Dae Ho. - Coach Choi.

606
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:06,794
I'm just going to go. I'll see you.

607
00:34:06,994 --> 00:34:09,494
No, Professor Yoon. I must tell you today.

608
00:34:10,494 --> 00:34:12,364
What's the matter, Seong Eun?

609
00:34:12,564 --> 00:34:14,224
You can tell him another day.

610
00:34:14,324 --> 00:34:15,564
He says he wants to go home.

611
00:34:15,564 --> 00:34:17,824
- That's... - We can talk another time.

612
00:34:18,024 --> 00:34:19,564
- I'll go now. - Wait...

613
00:34:20,624 --> 00:34:21,664
My gosh.

614
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:23,564
Dae Ho.

615
00:34:24,324 --> 00:34:26,094
What's the matter with you?

616
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,764
What did I do?

617
00:34:29,464 --> 00:34:31,094
My goodness!

618
00:34:32,324 --> 00:34:33,394
Gosh!

619
00:34:33,994 --> 00:34:35,064
Professor Yoon?

620
00:34:37,894 --> 00:34:39,094
Oh, gosh.

621
00:34:39,094 --> 00:34:41,224
We're here, Professor Yoon. Hang in there.

622
00:34:41,364 --> 00:34:42,994
Hold on for a second.

623
00:34:44,964 --> 00:34:47,064
What should I do?

624
00:34:49,524 --> 00:34:50,564
Be careful. Take it slow.

625
00:34:50,564 --> 00:34:53,024
- You're doing great, Professor. - How do I turn on the lights?

626
00:34:54,324 --> 00:34:55,624
Oh, the lights.

627
00:34:56,164 --> 00:34:58,724
- Go easy. Easy. - All right.

628
00:34:58,724 --> 00:35:00,994
Okay. Take one step at a time.

629
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:02,894
You're okay, right?

630
00:35:03,094 --> 00:35:04,464
No, I'm not okay.

631
00:35:04,464 --> 00:35:06,994
- Gosh, what should I do? - It's a bit messy...

632
00:35:08,164 --> 00:35:09,164
Gosh, it stinks.

633
00:35:09,494 --> 00:35:12,024
Wait. Hold on a second.

634
00:35:12,324 --> 00:35:13,594
Here.

635
00:35:15,094 --> 00:35:16,294
I got you.

636
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,364
Hold on.

637
00:35:19,494 --> 00:35:20,524
Are you okay?

638
00:35:21,364 --> 00:35:22,794
Gosh, it hurts.

639
00:35:23,824 --> 00:35:24,894
My goodness.

640
00:35:26,434 --> 00:35:27,594
My goodness.

641
00:35:28,264 --> 00:35:31,624
It'll hurt more when the painkiller wears out. I feel so terrible.

642
00:35:31,824 --> 00:35:33,094
No, I'm okay.

643
00:35:33,824 --> 00:35:35,094
I didn't break any bones.

644
00:35:35,824 --> 00:35:37,764
I'll get better after the weekend.

645
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:41,164
You got a fracture in your tailbone.

646
00:35:42,624 --> 00:35:43,624
I can't leave you like this.

647
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:46,964
You can't wash properly and need to eat before taking medicine.

648
00:35:48,764 --> 00:35:51,494
- I return with groceries tomorrow. - You'd better not!

649
00:35:53,864 --> 00:35:55,324
What I mean is that...

650
00:35:55,794 --> 00:35:58,864
if a woman visits a man who lives alone, rumors might spread...

651
00:35:58,864 --> 00:36:00,294
in the neighborhood.

652
00:36:01,164 --> 00:36:03,194
I'm completely against the idea.

653
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:04,494
What else can I do?

654
00:36:04,494 --> 00:36:07,364
He can't even get a glass of water by himself.

655
00:36:07,794 --> 00:36:09,094
My goodness.

656
00:36:11,994 --> 00:36:13,624
Fine, I'll do it.

657
00:36:15,194 --> 00:36:16,864
I'll take care of him.

658
00:36:17,194 --> 00:36:19,224
I'll get his groceries and make porridge.

659
00:36:19,224 --> 00:36:21,164
I'll support him when he goes to the bathroom.

660
00:36:22,064 --> 00:36:24,464
I might as well sleep here.

661
00:36:24,664 --> 00:36:27,934
Don't worry about a thing and leave. I'll take care of him.

662
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,434
Gosh.

663
00:36:37,364 --> 00:36:38,464
I can't eat fast because it's hot.

664
00:36:40,964 --> 00:36:42,934
Two more orders of seasoned meat, please.

665
00:36:43,194 --> 00:36:44,764
Nan Hee, you're eating quickly today.

666
00:36:44,764 --> 00:36:46,764
I was hungry because I only had bread today.

667
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:49,934
Meat is the best when someone else is buying it.

668
00:36:51,694 --> 00:36:53,624
- Here you go. - Calm down.

669
00:36:55,994 --> 00:36:58,664
You need to chew more instead of swallowing it.

670
00:36:58,664 --> 00:37:01,264
It's okay. Don't you know we have a stomach made of steel?

671
00:37:01,264 --> 00:37:03,224
- Stomach made of steel is awesome. - Awesome.

672
00:37:03,694 --> 00:37:06,494
Isn't the seasoned meat too salty? Do you want some rice?

673
00:37:06,594 --> 00:37:08,624
You're acting like an amateur.

674
00:37:08,624 --> 00:37:12,064
We'll fry the rice later. Don't you know it's FSRN?

675
00:37:12,434 --> 00:37:14,934
What's FSRN?

676
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:18,724
Fresh meat, seasoned meat, rice, and noodles are the basic course meal.

677
00:37:20,094 --> 00:37:22,624
I've never had such a meal, but seeing you two eat...

678
00:37:22,934 --> 00:37:24,764
awakens my appetite.

679
00:37:25,624 --> 00:37:27,194
- You should join us. - Join us.

680
00:37:27,194 --> 00:37:30,094
I'm in. Two additional orders of seasoned meat, please.

681
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:32,824
- What's wrong? - What are you doing?

682
00:37:32,824 --> 00:37:35,594
Is Bok Joo's boyfriend giving us a look for being tactless?

683
00:37:36,664 --> 00:37:38,764
Gosh, I won't eat anymore.

684
00:37:38,764 --> 00:37:40,794
Bok Joo kept giving me a look, too.

685
00:37:40,794 --> 00:37:43,624
What are you talking about? Help yourselves.

686
00:37:43,624 --> 00:37:45,594
You should help yourselves.

687
00:37:45,594 --> 00:37:47,764
You won't get this chance again.

688
00:37:50,264 --> 00:37:52,524
You already had a lot of fresh and seasoned meat.

689
00:37:52,524 --> 00:37:54,864
How will you finish fried rice and cold noodles?

690
00:37:55,394 --> 00:37:56,624
Thank you, Joon Hyung.

691
00:37:56,624 --> 00:37:59,164
- Thank you. - Thank you.

692
00:37:59,164 --> 00:38:00,224
Excuse me?

693
00:38:01,224 --> 00:38:02,564
How much is it?

694
00:38:06,194 --> 00:38:07,494
It's 128 dollars.

695
00:38:07,934 --> 00:38:09,964
- 128 dollars? - Yes.

696
00:38:10,824 --> 00:38:11,894
128...

697
00:38:13,694 --> 00:38:15,264
I'll pay with this.

698
00:38:21,434 --> 00:38:23,594
Did you get a new mobile phone? It's the new color.

699
00:38:24,934 --> 00:38:25,994
Was it expensive?

700
00:38:25,994 --> 00:38:28,524
No, it was only half of my monthly allowance.

701
00:38:29,694 --> 00:38:33,164
Gosh, we should have said we'd treat them next time.

702
00:38:33,464 --> 00:38:35,324
I had to treat them at some point.

703
00:38:35,324 --> 00:38:37,324
I'll consider that today.

704
00:38:37,864 --> 00:38:41,594
Eating with professional eaters was nice and strategic.

705
00:38:41,594 --> 00:38:43,624
I ate twice as more than I normally do.

706
00:38:43,624 --> 00:38:44,864
Right? I told you.

707
00:38:45,094 --> 00:38:48,294
- Are we going to karaoke next? - Karaoke?

708
00:38:48,294 --> 00:38:50,794
- Karaoke? - Are you being serious?

709
00:38:50,794 --> 00:38:52,794
You had a lot of meat already.

710
00:38:53,724 --> 00:38:55,294
- Karaoke! - Karaoke!

711
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:57,524
- Karaoke! - We aren't going to karaoke.

712
00:38:59,494 --> 00:39:02,094
- Joon Hyung! - Joon Hyung!

713
00:39:02,394 --> 00:39:04,934
Karaoke. Joon Hyung.

714
00:39:05,294 --> 00:39:07,364
- We'll see you there. - Joon Hyung.

715
00:39:07,364 --> 00:39:08,694
Let's go.

716
00:39:56,764 --> 00:39:58,864
(Text from Ah Young)

717
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:01,394
Jae Yi, I'm going to my hometown.

718
00:40:02,964 --> 00:40:04,964
I decided to work at my father's hospital for now.

719
00:40:06,764 --> 00:40:08,934
I didn't tell you in person in case I still have feelings for you.

720
00:40:09,664 --> 00:40:10,724
Take care.

721
00:40:37,664 --> 00:40:41,494
The number you have dialed is not available at this moment.

722
00:40:41,694 --> 00:40:43,194
There will be charges after the beep.

723
00:41:04,394 --> 00:41:06,264
You were good at singing.

724
00:41:06,264 --> 00:41:09,194
- It was fun. - Didn't Joon Hyung spend too much?

725
00:41:09,494 --> 00:41:12,094
- I feel slightly bad now. - No way.

726
00:41:12,194 --> 00:41:14,164
Did he? We'll treat you next time.

727
00:41:14,164 --> 00:41:17,564
No, I'll treat you next time.

728
00:41:17,724 --> 00:41:19,064
FSRN.

729
00:41:19,064 --> 00:41:20,094
- Awesome. - Awesome.

730
00:41:20,764 --> 00:41:22,664
See you later. Let's go.

731
00:41:23,524 --> 00:41:24,564
Aren't you coming?

732
00:41:25,724 --> 00:41:26,794
What?

733
00:41:27,664 --> 00:41:29,364
I'm coming,

734
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:32,094
but I need to talk to Joon Hyung for a bit.

735
00:41:32,224 --> 00:41:33,964
It's our curfew soon. We have to go.

736
00:41:33,964 --> 00:41:36,724
- We have to go. - Come on, let's go.

737
00:41:37,164 --> 00:41:38,724
- Let's go. - Come this way.

738
00:41:39,434 --> 00:41:40,964
Come on, you punk.

739
00:41:41,364 --> 00:41:42,434
- Hurry. - Let's go.

740
00:41:42,794 --> 00:41:44,894
- Let me go. Gosh. - Hurry up.

741
00:41:45,394 --> 00:41:48,994
See you in our dreams, Bok Joo.

742
00:41:54,194 --> 00:41:55,194
Joon Hyung.

743
00:41:55,294 --> 00:41:56,624
My goodness.

744
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:57,934
Let's go.

745
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:02,434
Where are you going?

746
00:42:02,894 --> 00:42:04,624
Where are you going, Bok Joo?

747
00:42:04,624 --> 00:42:06,824
I have so many questions to ask you.

748
00:42:07,094 --> 00:42:08,564
You need to sleep in our room tonight.

749
00:42:08,994 --> 00:42:11,164
You cunning girl. You won't get any sleep tonight. Let's go.

750
00:42:12,264 --> 00:42:13,264
Why?

751
00:42:19,064 --> 00:42:21,264
Tell us how far you two went.

752
00:42:22,264 --> 00:42:24,164
What do you mean?

753
00:42:24,824 --> 00:42:26,434
I don't understand the question.

754
00:42:26,434 --> 00:42:28,724
Look how she's pretending not to understand.

755
00:42:29,094 --> 00:42:31,364
You'd better answer us earlier than later.

756
00:42:31,464 --> 00:42:33,664
Nan Hee asked how far you two went.

757
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,934
This is how far we went.

758
00:42:40,594 --> 00:42:42,324
We went to the movie theater and the sea.

759
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:43,824
Come on.

760
00:42:44,994 --> 00:42:45,994
You two.

761
00:42:46,994 --> 00:42:50,524
Did you two kiss? There's no way you didn't.

762
00:42:51,064 --> 00:42:53,294
That's private. I won't make any comment.

763
00:42:53,294 --> 00:42:56,764
They definitely did it. My goodness.

764
00:42:56,764 --> 00:43:00,224
I can't imagine Bok Joo and Joon Hyung kissing.

765
00:43:01,664 --> 00:43:03,194
I shouldn't be jealous.

766
00:43:03,194 --> 00:43:05,434
I don't want to admit it, but I'm really jealous.

767
00:43:06,064 --> 00:43:08,764
When did you kiss? Where and how did it happen?

768
00:43:08,764 --> 00:43:10,394
Tell us in detail.

769
00:43:18,494 --> 00:43:20,064
Do you mean the first or the second?

770
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:21,224
Oh, my goodness.

771
00:43:21,464 --> 00:43:23,434
- Why you... - Goodness.

772
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,994
You're the ones who asked.

773
00:43:25,064 --> 00:43:27,064
Look at her bragging.

774
00:43:27,434 --> 00:43:29,464
I'm so jealous of you.

775
00:43:29,464 --> 00:43:31,434
Oh, my gosh!

776
00:43:31,624 --> 00:43:33,364
Come to your senses.

777
00:43:34,094 --> 00:43:37,524
You're basically destroying yourself. Don't live that way.

778
00:43:37,524 --> 00:43:39,964
What's wrong with Bok Joo?

779
00:43:40,364 --> 00:43:43,394
I also really like her. She has a great personality.

780
00:43:43,394 --> 00:43:46,094
However, your girlfriend is a completely different matter...

781
00:43:46,094 --> 00:43:47,724
from someone with a great personality.

782
00:43:48,094 --> 00:43:49,264
More than anything,

783
00:43:50,764 --> 00:43:54,024
she eats too much, and she's too strong.

784
00:43:54,024 --> 00:43:55,224
What's wrong with that?

785
00:43:55,994 --> 00:43:57,064
I think...

786
00:43:58,094 --> 00:43:59,264
she's sexier that way.

787
00:44:00,024 --> 00:44:01,024
Sexy?

788
00:44:01,664 --> 00:44:04,094
You're driving me crazy. This is game over.

789
00:44:04,094 --> 00:44:07,694
You're head over heels for her, aren't you?

790
00:44:22,464 --> 00:44:25,094
Is your competition today? How do you feel?

791
00:44:26,394 --> 00:44:27,394
I'm okay.

792
00:44:29,164 --> 00:44:30,224
Actually, I'm not.

793
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:33,864
I've competed a lot since I was a child.

794
00:44:34,724 --> 00:44:36,194
I'm the most nervous today.

795
00:44:38,364 --> 00:44:39,764
Do you have a moment?

796
00:44:44,064 --> 00:44:46,024
I don't show it to anyone.

797
00:44:46,024 --> 00:44:48,024
I'm showing it to you since today is special.

798
00:44:53,164 --> 00:44:54,194
Make your wish.

799
00:44:55,364 --> 00:44:57,864
- Does it grant your wish? - Of course.

800
00:44:57,864 --> 00:44:59,724
I always pray here before competitions.

801
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:02,164
- I won, remember? - Okay.

802
00:45:10,924 --> 00:45:12,594
Do you feel much better?

803
00:45:13,494 --> 00:45:16,024
- Did you wish for the nationals? - No.

804
00:45:16,524 --> 00:45:18,064
I wished for a competition without regrets.

805
00:45:20,094 --> 00:45:22,964
Joon Hyung and I will come see you at the competition. You can do it.

806
00:45:23,964 --> 00:45:25,324
I'll treat you guys if things go well.

807
00:45:25,694 --> 00:45:26,694
You can do it.

808
00:45:26,864 --> 00:45:28,624
I should be gentle because you're so delicate.

809
00:45:35,964 --> 00:45:36,994
You should eat.

810
00:45:39,764 --> 00:45:42,094
Come on. This is a pretty good meal.

811
00:45:43,024 --> 00:45:45,864
Did you expect a feast or what?

812
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,024
Well...

813
00:45:49,194 --> 00:45:52,164
I can't eat eggs without ketchup.

814
00:45:52,794 --> 00:45:53,864
Come again?

815
00:45:54,664 --> 00:45:55,664
Never mind.

816
00:45:56,424 --> 00:45:57,524
I'll just eat it.

817
00:46:30,924 --> 00:46:31,964
I should go get a new one.

818
00:46:32,094 --> 00:46:34,264
Here. Take this.

819
00:46:35,024 --> 00:46:36,164
I have money.

820
00:46:48,164 --> 00:46:49,224
Hey.

821
00:46:50,664 --> 00:46:53,324
Can you... Can you also get mayonnaise?

822
00:46:56,164 --> 00:46:57,164
It's me.

823
00:46:59,694 --> 00:47:00,864
The door was open.

824
00:47:05,564 --> 00:47:07,664
Is he a kid or what?

825
00:47:08,494 --> 00:47:10,864
Why can't he eat eggs without ketchup?

826
00:47:17,694 --> 00:47:20,264
- It's so cold. - Just stay still.

827
00:47:20,264 --> 00:47:22,364
Warm compresses will help you recover quickly.

828
00:47:22,364 --> 00:47:23,864
Gosh, it's okay.

829
00:47:24,194 --> 00:47:26,764
I'll do it later, so don't worry about it.

830
00:47:27,264 --> 00:47:28,264
You should leave.

831
00:47:28,824 --> 00:47:30,394
Dae Ho is right.

832
00:47:30,594 --> 00:47:33,624
People will get the wrong idea if they see you here. Get going now.

833
00:47:33,624 --> 00:47:34,794
I don't care.

834
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,964
Who cares about what people think?

835
00:47:44,594 --> 00:47:45,664
You know...

836
00:47:46,294 --> 00:47:47,364
that I've had...

837
00:47:49,824 --> 00:47:51,064
a crush on you for a long time.

838
00:47:54,894 --> 00:47:57,264
Stop talking nonsense.

839
00:47:57,564 --> 00:47:58,594
Why would you?

840
00:47:59,164 --> 00:48:01,294
Why on earth would a woman like you have a crush...

841
00:48:02,924 --> 00:48:05,364
- on an old divorced man? - Don't think about those things.

842
00:48:06,064 --> 00:48:07,194
As a woman,

843
00:48:09,794 --> 00:48:10,864
what do you think of me?

844
00:48:13,964 --> 00:48:14,964
Is that a no?

845
00:48:16,924 --> 00:48:18,824
You don't find me attractive at all?

846
00:48:31,564 --> 00:48:32,564
All right, then.

847
00:48:33,594 --> 00:48:35,194
I'm really sorry.

848
00:48:36,364 --> 00:48:37,664
I will never...

849
00:48:38,224 --> 00:48:41,294
put you in an awkward position again.

850
00:48:41,564 --> 00:48:42,594
I'm sorry.

851
00:48:59,964 --> 00:49:01,024
Are you okay?

852
00:49:01,224 --> 00:49:02,594
- Gosh... - Are you all right?

853
00:49:03,364 --> 00:49:06,524
- Why did you do that? - Leave it. I'm okay. Gosh...

854
00:49:07,894 --> 00:49:10,024
It's my fault, isn't it? I'm sorry.

855
00:49:10,024 --> 00:49:11,024
What should I do?

856
00:49:40,164 --> 00:49:41,794
Gosh, I'm so nervous for her.

857
00:49:41,794 --> 00:49:43,324
I hope Si Ho does a good job today.

858
00:49:44,924 --> 00:49:48,024
Girls bond in an unnatural way that I can't understand.

859
00:49:48,264 --> 00:49:50,224
You're talking about her as if she's your best friend.

860
00:49:50,564 --> 00:49:53,094
Are you being sarcastic? You're mocking me now, aren't you?

861
00:49:53,364 --> 00:49:55,264
No, not at all.

862
00:49:55,424 --> 00:49:58,164
I'm just saying that you girls are very broad-minded.

863
00:49:59,424 --> 00:50:00,624
Anyway, I'm so happy.

864
00:50:00,794 --> 00:50:02,494
We no longer have to see each other in secret.

865
00:50:02,664 --> 00:50:05,094
We should've told everyone a long time ago.

866
00:50:05,424 --> 00:50:07,864
How can you say that? They gave you such a hard time yesterday.

867
00:50:07,964 --> 00:50:09,894
Exactly. I've paid my dues,

868
00:50:09,894 --> 00:50:11,764
so I can now be open about how much I like you.

869
00:50:13,494 --> 00:50:15,094
I'm already worried.

870
00:50:15,524 --> 00:50:17,224
People will badmouth me like crazy.

871
00:50:18,094 --> 00:50:19,964
"Is Bok Joo's family rich?"

872
00:50:19,964 --> 00:50:22,094
"Did she threaten Joon Hyung?"

873
00:50:22,094 --> 00:50:24,064
"Bok Joo hit the jackpot."

874
00:50:24,064 --> 00:50:26,924
"She's not good enough for Joon Hyung." They will go on about it.

875
00:50:26,924 --> 00:50:28,324
Hey, don't say that.

876
00:50:28,324 --> 00:50:29,794
You're such a pretty girl.

877
00:50:30,464 --> 00:50:31,524
Don't worry.

878
00:50:31,524 --> 00:50:35,224
I'll show everyone that I like you more so that people don't say that.

879
00:50:35,594 --> 00:50:38,094
Look, okay? Hello, isn't my girlfriend so pretty?

880
00:50:38,864 --> 00:50:40,464
- Yes, she is. - Isn't she stunning?

881
00:50:40,894 --> 00:50:42,864
- She's so gorgeous. - You're crazy. Let's go.

882
00:50:42,864 --> 00:50:44,094
This girl is mine!

883
00:50:44,264 --> 00:50:45,664
Hey! What is wrong with you?

884
00:50:46,064 --> 00:50:47,364
Stop it. Let's go.

(2017 Gymnastics National Team Selection Competition)

887
00:51:01,994 --> 00:51:04,294
(2017 Gymnastics National Team Selection Competition)

888
00:51:11,824 --> 00:51:12,824
Hey, Si Ho.

889
00:51:13,964 --> 00:51:15,024
Are you ready?

890
00:51:15,264 --> 00:51:16,364
How are you feeling today?

891
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:17,824
I'm feeling good.

892
00:51:18,024 --> 00:51:19,394
Just stay calm and do your best.

893
00:51:19,794 --> 00:51:22,964
This is your last chance, and it'll mark a new beginning for me.

894
00:51:24,224 --> 00:51:25,924
Team A, Na Eun Ji from Yongsan Sport University...

895
00:51:25,924 --> 00:51:27,924
and Song Si Ho from Haneol Sport University. Please get ready.

896
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:40,194
Song Si Ho from Haneol Sport University is entering.

897
00:51:40,194 --> 00:51:43,264
I'm sure all gymnastics fans know who she is.

898
00:51:44,024 --> 00:51:47,594
She actually made a mistake in the preliminary round.

899
00:51:47,724 --> 00:51:50,024
That's right. No matter how experienced you are,

900
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:51,864
competitions like this are very nerve-racking.

901
00:51:52,094 --> 00:51:54,164
Her hoop and Indian club performances...

902
00:51:54,164 --> 00:51:56,564
- were done flawlessly. - Yes.

903
00:51:56,564 --> 00:51:59,294
She got an especially high score on its artistry.

904
00:51:59,424 --> 00:52:00,494
That's right.

905
00:52:01,264 --> 00:52:02,324
(2017 Gymnastics National Team Selection Competition)

906
00:52:31,364 --> 00:52:33,924
Oh, no. That's too bad.

907
00:52:34,164 --> 00:52:36,494
That was a very big mistake.

908
00:52:36,664 --> 00:52:39,094
Yes. She threw the ball too high.

909
00:52:39,424 --> 00:52:41,464
She'll get 0.1 penalty points per step.

910
00:52:41,464 --> 00:52:44,524
She'll have additional 0.3 points deducted for going over the line.

911
00:52:44,524 --> 00:52:45,864
It's too bad.

912
00:52:51,464 --> 00:52:53,894
Don't be nervous. You'll get a good score.

913
00:52:54,664 --> 00:52:55,824
Just control your facial expressions,

914
00:52:56,164 --> 00:52:57,424
and good luck with the ribbon performance.

915
00:53:04,094 --> 00:53:06,494
Look. Her score is 18.2.

916
00:53:06,894 --> 00:53:09,464
She didn't get any points deducted aside from those...

917
00:53:09,524 --> 00:53:11,464
penalty points from the mistake.

918
00:53:11,764 --> 00:53:14,924
Right. I don't think she got penalty points for going over the line.

919
00:53:24,164 --> 00:53:26,164
It's honestly so unfair.

920
00:53:26,424 --> 00:53:28,764
We get penalty points for just slightly touching the ribbon,

921
00:53:29,224 --> 00:53:32,194
- while someone gets no penalty. - That's what I'm saying.

922
00:53:32,494 --> 00:53:34,694
We should just blame the fact that our coach isn't as influential.

923
00:53:38,694 --> 00:53:40,924
Now, we'll watch a ribbon performance...

924
00:53:40,924 --> 00:53:43,724
by Song Si Ho from Haneol Sport University in Team A.

925
00:53:45,664 --> 00:53:48,794
Song Si Ho from Haneol Sport University. Her specialty...

926
00:53:48,924 --> 00:53:50,424
is ribbon.

927
00:53:50,724 --> 00:53:52,824
That's right. I hope she can forget about the mistake from earlier.

928
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:54,624
"Libertango" by Astor Piazzolla.

929
00:53:55,064 --> 00:53:57,924
I hope her performance is as liberating as the title.

930
00:53:57,924 --> 00:53:58,994
Let's watch it now.

931
00:54:03,894 --> 00:54:06,624
(2017 Gymnastics National Team Selection Competition)

932
00:55:39,164 --> 00:55:41,494
- Is she crazy? - What is she doing?

933
00:55:41,794 --> 00:55:43,594
- What's going on? - Pick it up.

934
00:55:43,594 --> 00:55:45,794
- Is she okay? - What's wrong with her?

935
00:55:45,794 --> 00:55:47,364
- Pick it up. - Did she give up?

936
00:55:47,764 --> 00:55:49,194
- What are you doing? - Pick it up now.

937
00:55:49,194 --> 00:55:50,564
Hurry up and pick it up.

938
00:55:50,564 --> 00:55:52,224
- What's happening? - Is she okay?

939
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:54,764
What is she doing? Si Ho, are you crazy?

940
00:55:54,864 --> 00:55:57,094
- Pick up the ribbon. - Pick it up, Si Ho!

941
00:56:13,864 --> 00:56:16,764
Your ex-girlfriend was a bit cool today.

942
00:56:17,494 --> 00:56:18,494
I admit it.

943
00:56:18,824 --> 00:56:21,664
I know. She was so cool. I kind of regret breaking up with...

944
00:56:22,624 --> 00:56:24,064
I take that back.

945
00:56:24,094 --> 00:56:27,594
You just ask for pain. You should watch your words.

946
00:56:27,994 --> 00:56:30,494
If you don't, I will tear your hair out.

947
00:56:31,424 --> 00:56:34,364
You brought it up. Fine. I will be careful.

948
00:56:39,194 --> 00:56:40,264
Joon Hyung.

949
00:56:41,524 --> 00:56:44,994
We're going to have our last competition someday, right?

950
00:56:46,364 --> 00:56:48,294
Would I be able to...

951
00:56:48,294 --> 00:56:50,394
let everything go just like Si Ho?

952
00:56:52,194 --> 00:56:53,224
I'm not sure I can do that.

953
00:56:53,724 --> 00:56:56,924
You don't know that. You can't be sure what will happen in life.

954
00:56:59,424 --> 00:57:00,424
It suddenly scares me.

955
00:57:00,964 --> 00:57:03,624
Hey. Even if it's scary, it's not something you can avoid.

956
00:57:03,624 --> 00:57:04,624
Don't be scared.

957
00:57:05,164 --> 00:57:07,364
Let's just work hard and get through the day.

958
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:10,694
Let's work hard to lift weights, swim,

959
00:57:10,694 --> 00:57:11,694
and...

960
00:57:12,964 --> 00:57:14,024
date.

961
00:57:15,664 --> 00:57:18,994
What you just said sounded classy and cool, Joon Hyung.

962
00:57:19,194 --> 00:57:21,424
Should I try not to be so cool?

963
00:57:22,824 --> 00:57:24,064
That's not funny.

964
00:57:25,364 --> 00:57:27,624
Fine. I will stop, okay?

965
00:57:28,224 --> 00:57:30,094
But if you keep hearing it, you'll get used to...

966
00:57:30,624 --> 00:57:31,694
That's enough.

967
00:57:32,264 --> 00:57:34,724
- Let's go. - Okay. Let's go.

968
00:57:35,924 --> 00:57:37,764
(Couple Pharmacy)

969
00:57:40,794 --> 00:57:43,294
Gosh, I guess Jae Yi is going to be late again.

970
00:57:43,564 --> 00:57:46,664
He said he has to prepare for the seminar. He should be at his clinic.

971
00:57:47,724 --> 00:57:50,794
I just hope he will get married soon.

972
00:57:51,764 --> 00:57:55,064
He's handsome, and he has a decent job.

973
00:57:55,924 --> 00:57:58,394
But he never leaves his clinic when he should be dating.

974
00:57:59,024 --> 00:58:00,494
Are you complaining he's working too hard?

975
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:03,964
People will say you're too greedy.

976
00:58:04,324 --> 00:58:06,064
I just feel bad for him.

977
00:58:06,824 --> 00:58:10,064
I really liked that girl we met, Ah Young.

978
00:58:10,524 --> 00:58:13,024
I think she likes Jae Yi, too.

979
00:58:13,264 --> 00:58:14,964
I can tell right away, you know.

980
00:58:15,094 --> 00:58:16,564
Gosh. Is that so?

981
00:58:17,564 --> 00:58:19,724
Why don't you become a fortuneteller instead, then?

982
00:58:20,264 --> 00:58:21,464
Maybe I should.

983
00:58:22,664 --> 00:58:24,094
I'm sorry, but we're closed.

984
00:58:28,464 --> 00:58:29,494
Hello.

985
00:58:32,764 --> 00:58:33,764
Hi.

986
00:58:41,064 --> 00:58:42,324
What happened?

987
00:58:43,624 --> 00:58:45,664
Why haven't you contacted us?

988
00:58:49,394 --> 00:58:51,394
Whenever we see Joon Hyung, we felt so...

989
00:58:53,824 --> 00:58:56,394
How could you be so heartless?

990
00:58:57,964 --> 00:58:58,994
I'm sorry.

991
00:59:02,094 --> 00:59:04,394
I'm very sorry to you, too.

992
00:59:04,864 --> 00:59:07,524
It's fine. We don't have to talk about the past.

993
00:59:08,664 --> 00:59:10,624
So how have you been?

994
00:59:11,394 --> 00:59:12,624
You still live in Canada, right?

995
00:59:13,894 --> 00:59:15,294
When did you arrive in Korea?

996
00:59:17,194 --> 00:59:19,794
I've been in Vancouver, Canada.

997
00:59:22,024 --> 00:59:24,294
I arrived in Seoul a couple of days ago.

998
00:59:27,464 --> 00:59:29,194
I didn't plan on coming back,

999
00:59:30,094 --> 00:59:31,694
so I couldn't call you beforehand.

1000
00:59:39,464 --> 00:59:41,824
I have something to tell you.

1001
00:59:43,324 --> 00:59:44,324
You must think...

1002
00:59:45,794 --> 00:59:47,264
I'm such a shameless person.

1003
00:59:53,194 --> 00:59:54,964
Gosh, those girls have no sense of loyalty.

1004
00:59:54,964 --> 00:59:58,464
They didn't even wait for me while I tidy up the mattresses.

1005
00:59:58,464 --> 01:00:00,824
I know eating tonkatsu is important, but still...

1006
01:00:03,494 --> 01:00:04,494
Excuse me.

1007
01:00:05,024 --> 01:00:07,724
Could you show me the way to the pool?

1008
01:00:07,724 --> 01:00:09,094
I've never been to this school.

1009
01:00:10,094 --> 01:00:12,424
It's in the building you see over there.

1010
01:00:16,594 --> 01:00:18,064
Would you like me to take you there?

1011
01:00:20,024 --> 01:00:21,024
Thank you.

1012
01:00:29,094 --> 01:00:31,024
If you go this way, you'll see the pool.

1013
01:00:31,764 --> 01:00:32,794
Thank you.

1014
01:00:40,024 --> 01:00:41,294
Joon Hyung!

1015
01:00:43,294 --> 01:00:44,294
Bok Joo.

1016
01:00:56,094 --> 01:00:57,194
Joon Hyung.

1017
01:01:02,724 --> 01:01:03,824
Joon Hyung.

1018
01:01:06,424 --> 01:01:07,794
Do you recognize me?

1019
01:01:15,294 --> 01:01:16,724
It's me. Your mom.

1020
01:01:33,324 --> 01:01:34,424
(Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo)

1021
01:01:34,424 --> 01:01:37,164
Your mom must've missed you a lot, too.

1022
01:01:37,164 --> 01:01:40,424
I'm sorry, Joon Hyung. I should've come to see you sooner.

1023
01:01:40,424 --> 01:01:42,364
Bok Joo, you brat. They want you at Taereung.

1024
01:01:42,364 --> 01:01:43,864
- Hey! - Congratulations!

1025
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:46,869
I'll just drink. I won't touch you.

1026
01:01:46,894 --> 01:01:49,594
Did my mom come back to ask for money? Did she?

1027
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:52,424
You can't reach Joon Hyung from yesterday?

1028
01:01:52,424 --> 01:01:53,494
Joon Hyung!

1029
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:55,664
This is even sadder than...

1030
01:01:56,094 --> 01:01:57,594
when my mom abandoned me, Bok Joo.
