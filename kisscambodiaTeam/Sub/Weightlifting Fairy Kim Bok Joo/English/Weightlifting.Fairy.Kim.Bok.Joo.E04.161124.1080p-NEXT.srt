00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,150
Crisp new bills...

3
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,310
tend to stick together, you know.

4
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,810
It should be 590 dollars.

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:23,980
Let me count it again.

6
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,310
Yes. It's 590 dollars.

7
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,380
Okay. Since you counted it multiple times,

8
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,810
I won't count it.

9
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,980
I received 590 dollars.

10
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,610
Your payment is done. Please change before the treatment.

11
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,510
You'll see a gown in the locker in the dressing room over there.

12
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,310
A gown?

13
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,840
(Episode 4, Her Double Life)

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,910
You're a lot healthier than I thought.

15
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,710
Yes. I think I am.

16
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,080
Maybe because I eat well.

17
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,940
Oh, I didn't mean that.

18
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,240
Some people are overweight in an unhealthy way with much body fat.

19
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,880
Others are overweight in a healthy way with muscles. You're the latter.

20
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,280
- Is that a good thing? - Of course.

21
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,510
We use body mass index to compare the amount of...

22
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,840
muscles and body fat.

23
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,210
Look at this. Yours is 24. It's within normal range.

24
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,240
Many people think they're fat after watching...

25
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,780
skinny people or female idol groups.

26
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,540
As a doctor in a weight clinic, I feel bad.

27
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,780
I know, right?

28
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,440
I saw an idol group on TV before.

29
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,940
They only ate half a sweet potato and a boiled egg for a meal.

30
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,240
A bird would eat more than they do.

31
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,910
I have a friend named Jeong Nan Hee.

32
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,810
She said she'd lose weight eating sweet potatoes only,

33
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,140
then she devoured a box of sweet potatoes a day.

34
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,410
But that kind of extreme diet has a high possibility of failing.

35
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,880
Like I told you before, it's important to lose weight...

36
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,040
in a slow and healthy way.

37
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,110
- Don't obsess with your weight. - Okay.

38
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,780
I don't want to lose a bunch of weight overnight.

39
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,010
Well... I've been...

40
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,040
living just fine with this body.

41
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,040
I think it's good to lose weight in a healthy way...

42
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,610
like you said.

43
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,740
Great. I'll look forward to your...

44
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,310
healthy weight loss.

45
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,980
Now, shall we...

46
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,910
move to the bed?

47
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,710
Bed?

48
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,780
For the treatment. Please lie down on that bed.

49
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,840
I'll apply some cream.

50
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,410
Excuse me.

51
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,440
Let's begin the treatment.

52
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:06,810
It might be a little cold.

53
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,740
Please write down everything you eat, even snacks.

54
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,710
It helps us to provide precise counseling.

55
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,810
These are the instructions for stretches. Please do them often.

56
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,340
Thank you.

57
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,580
See you later, Bok Joo.

58
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,740
Today is your first day, so don't change your diet too much.

59
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,240
And it'll probably rain tonight. Don't forget to take an umbrella.

60
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,380
Oh, your umbrella.

61
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,210
I'll make sure to give it back to you in the next session.

62
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,440
I wasn't asking for my umbrella. Did it sound that way?

63
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,410
No. It didn't,

64
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,410
but I should give it back to you anyway.

65
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,650
Goodbye, then.

66
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,310
Get home safe.

67
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,010
How do I wear this?

68
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,810
Why don't you...

69
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,080
try this instead? It'll look better on you.

70
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,740
It's pretty. Take a look in the mirror.

71
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,310
Doesn't it look bad?

72
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,910
You look much prettier and more feminine.

73
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,910
I'll take this.

74
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,280
I'll wrap it for you.

75
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,640
Do you make those yourself?

76
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,380
I either sell them or give them as gifts.

77
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,680
I don't think it's polite to return the umbrella by itself.

78
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,910
- Are you dating someone? - Excuse me?

79
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,810
- No. - Why can't you maintain the weight?

80
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,210
You aren't going out on dates, are you?

81
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,980
I don't know what to do with you.

82
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,880
You won't go to Russia. You can't keep your weight down.

83
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,180
How will you join the national team?

84
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,480
You need to have more sense of urgency.

85
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,580
I understand. I'll take better care of myself.

86
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,710
Here you go.

87
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,480
Come on. I want some, too.

88
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,410
It's so sweet.

89
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,380
Let's hide it and eat it again later.

90
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,410
Of course, we'll eat it.

91
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,140
- Of course. - We can't waste any.

92
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,840
By the way, what's going on with Si Ho?

93
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,010
She's gotten slow.

94
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,810
Yesterday, she barged into the boys' dormitory...

95
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,480
and cried in front of her ex-boyfriend.

96
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,810
Really?

97
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,580
Is she in shock because she didn't make the national team?

98
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,480
- I've never seen Coach scold her. - Me, neither.

99
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,080
Si Ho had always been our coach's favorite.

100
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,340
I feel bad for Si Ho.

101
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,910
- Why? - She's not as agile due to her age.

102
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,880
She isn't as good as before.

103
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,440
She doesn't have financial support from her parents, either.

104
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,180
Why not? Isn't her family rich?

105
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,480
You have no idea, do you?

106
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,540
What do you mean?

107
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,380
You wouldn't even believe what happened today.

108
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,880
- What? - What happened?

109
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,680
I went to see our coach earlier today.

110
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,140
Then I saw Si Ho...

111
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,580
coming towards us like she was upset, so...

112
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,880
It's true that I barged in the boys' dormitory,

113
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,840
but I didn't cry.

114
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,140
People made it too dramatic.

115
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,910
Soo Bin.

116
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,610
Yes?

117
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,180
Thank you for understanding me.

118
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,840
However,

119
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,240
don't worry about my family business.

120
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,740
It's nothing for you to worry about.

121
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,540
Totally.

122
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,410
- See you. - See you later.

123
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,580
- Oh, my goodness. - Are you okay?

124
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,910
What's wrong? Are you okay?

125
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,480
Do you have an upset stomach?

126
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,780
Here.

127
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,710
Thank you.

128
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,810
Hey, aren't you Si Ho?

129
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,340
Hello.

130
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,540
I haven't seen you in a while.

131
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,250
When did you get back from Taereung?

132
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,210
It's been a few days.

133
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,610
Would it be impolite to welcome you back?

134
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,540
It's okay. You can go back again.

135
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,140
Many athletes haven't even made it to Taereung.

136
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,180
Right.

137
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,280
Are you feeling okay? Shall I get you some medicine?

138
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,840
No, I'm okay.

139
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,750
- See you later. - Stop by the infirmary sometime.

140
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,680
I'll massage your ankles. I know you had weak ankles.

141
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,140
I will.

142
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:09,610
I have to get back to training.

143
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,980
Go ahead.

144
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,910
- Here you go. - Thanks.

145
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,840
How did she get an upset stomach? She doesn't even eat much.

146
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,010
Will it be okay?

147
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,280
It'll be fine. It isn't an expensive gift.

148
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,810
You startled me, you punk.

149
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,880
Most girls cringe when startled, but you get ready to punch.

150
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,210
I knew it.

151
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,080
Speaking of which, do you want my fist in your face?

152
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,910
Come on.

153
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:06,080
Don't you know how to take a joke?

154
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,240
What's that?

155
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,280
It's not your business.

156
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,540
Is that food again?

157
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,740
What is it?

158
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,140
- Isn't it food? - Are you crazy?

159
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,510
How dare you?

160
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,840
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

161
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,680
I keep forgetting that you're a woman.

162
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,840
I'm really sorry.

163
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,180
Sincere apologies.

164
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,340
I'm sorry, Bok Joo.

165
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,580
What?

166
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:45,880
What is it?

167
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,740
What's wrong with you? Is it some kind of a horror movie?

168
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,380
It's not about me.

169
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,280
It's about my friend.

170
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,280
Between your two friends,

171
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,880
which one?

172
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,310
I'm not talking about them.

173
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,080
Anyway,

174
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,580
my friend...

175
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,440
has a crush on someone.

176
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,680
She borrowed something from him and has to return it.

177
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,580
She wants to give him a gift to thank him.

178
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,240
- Will it be okay? - Who doesn't like gifts?

179
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,010
- It's okay, right? - As long as she didn't make it.

180
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,610
What's wrong with a handmade gift?

181
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,340
Think about it.

182
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,640
If she made the gift,

183
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:40,140
it means she thought about him while she was making it.

184
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,710
He'd feel uncomfortable.

185
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,380
You said they aren't close yet.

186
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,180
Would he feel uncomfortable?

187
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,580
Of course.

188
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,180
If her feelings about him are too obvious,

189
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,540
he'll definitely take a step back.

190
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,540
Send a simple message to thank him instead...

191
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,310
Hey!

192
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,440
I was so close to making a mistake.

193
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,980
What if I didn't bump into Joon Hyung?

194
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,610
Gosh.

195
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,180
What should I write?

196
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,710
Make it as simple as possible.

197
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,040
Does it look okay?

198
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,440
I don't like the handwriting.

199
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,740
I should have practiced my handwriting.

200
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,180
Oh, sorry.

201
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,510
That's a pretty umbrella. Did you buy it?

202
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,340
No, I borrowed it from someone.

203
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,980
(Ms. Kim Bok Joo, you have an appointment tomorrow at 2pm.)

204
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,440
(J Weight Clinic)

205
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,810
You seem happy about something.

206
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,710
No, it's nothing.

207
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,080
You must be dating someone.

208
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,780
- I'm jealous. - No way.

209
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,310
You're bad at guessing.

210
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,710
How could I ever date someone?

211
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,840
You're very bad at lying.

212
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,810
I'm not lying.

213
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,240
Let's just say that you aren't.

214
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,340
I'm going to bed. Goodnight.

215
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:40,880
Gosh.

216
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,180
What? Really?

217
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,910
- Really, really? - Yes.

218
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,910
The rumor spread everywhere.

219
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:03,580
People call it, "Si Ho Attacked Boys' Dormitory."

220
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,840
I guarantee that it's one of the top three news.

221
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,980
She's much bolder than I thought.

222
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,110
That's awesome.

223
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,210
Gymnasts can be strong-willed.

224
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,710
They even spit out chicken after tasting it.

225
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,710
I'm not surprised by her attack.

226
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,810
The fact that she dated Joon Hyung is more shocking.

227
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,340
Why would she? She's too good for him.

228
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,240
Joon Hyung is one of the popular boys in school.

229
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,440
That's true. You can't disagree with that, Bok Joo.

230
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,010
Joon Hyung is cute.

231
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,680
Good looks aren't the only thing that matters.

232
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,880
You shouldn't judge a book by its cover.

233
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,110
He needs to be mature,

234
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,280
and he's far from it.

235
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,340
Hey, you three.

236
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,180
Are you the only ones here?

237
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,180
Did you come here to chitchat?

238
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,440
You've gotten too lax.

239
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,340
Just because you've been here two years...

240
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,580
doesn't mean your seniors are your equal.

241
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,440
Do you think the gym is your playground?

242
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,810
No, I'm sorry.

243
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,480
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

244
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,310
They've been lax for a while.

245
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,010
They don't even clean the equipments after their training.

246
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,540
Look at the chalk powder.

247
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,880
Look how the gym turned into a pigsty!

248
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,410
What's going on?

249
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,980
- What is it? - They've gotten so lax.

250
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,010
They don't even clean the equipments.

251
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,910
They only chitchat when they should be training.

252
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,540
Hey, go easy on them.

253
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,180
Strictly speaking, it's our fault that we didn't manage them well.

254
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:23,440
What are you girls doing? Go set up everything for the training.

255
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,680
- Okay. - Okay.

256
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,840
Hey, Woon Gi.

257
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,140
Why did you let them go like that? You made us look stupid.

258
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,310
The training will begin shortly. Scold them later.

259
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,380
Who are you to decide and dictate such matters?

260
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,940
Are you bragging because you're the team leader? I'm a senior, too.

261
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,340
I get that you won a few medals, but you can't look down on us...

262
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,680
Sorry, excuse me for a minute.

263
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,580
Gosh, I'm just speechless.

264
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,310
He made you look stupid, Sang Chul.

265
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:52,680
(Appointment at the clinic.)

266
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,110
Gosh, they're so annoying.

267
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,480
Are we their toys or what? They always take things out on us.

268
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,040
I think I mopped way too hard. My hand is shaking.

269
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,340
- Hey, look at this. - It happens every year, you know.

270
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,010
Even last year, those in their senior years were always on edge.

271
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,640
Right. They're graduating soon,

272
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,010
and there are only few tournaments left.

273
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,980
They should be getting offers from semi-professional teams,

274
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,580
but they haven't heard anything. It must be frustrating.

275
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,040
Soon, it'll be our problem.

276
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,210
- We'll be in our senior year soon. - But still,

277
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,540
they shouldn't be taking it all out on us.

278
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,740
Exactly. Let's not be like them.

279
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,950
We're good at what we do, so that won't happen. Don't you agree?

280
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,540
Girls, I have to get going. Take my plate back for me, okay?

281
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,280
Hey, where are you going? Are you going on a delivery?

282
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,180
- Yes. I'll see you girls later. - Hey.

283
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,010
Goodness, everything is either black or gray.

284
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:47,210
Is my wardrobe customized for funerals? It's so monotonous.

285
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,640
I guess this is the best option I have.

286
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,080
You came.

287
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,910
This was so helpful. Thank you.

288
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,640
Oh, you can just keep it.

289
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,880
- It's my brother's, but it's okay. - No.

290
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,740
I should give it back to you.

291
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,340
I don't like feeling indebted to anyone.

292
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,340
I guess you can say that I'm a perfectionist.

293
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,740
That's a cute hairpin. It looks good on you.

294
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,610
Really?

295
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,640
I saw it rolling around on my floor...

296
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,640
and thought I should put it on.

297
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,180
I see.

298
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,410
- Let's check your body mass index. - Okay.

299
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,010
I can't believe that it didn't drop at all, not even by 100g.

300
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,710
- That's so odd. - You just started the program.

301
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,040
I knew that it'd take a while since you have high muscle mass.

302
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,840
Also, we made a promise.

303
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,280
- Healthy weight loss. - Yes. "Healthy" is the key.

304
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,210
You're overweight around your middle, so let's focus on that area.

305
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,480
The program must be accompanied by exercise to target the area,

306
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,140
but university students probably don't have time for that these days.

307
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,450
Yes, it's a little difficult.

308
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,950
May I ask you what you're majoring in?

309
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,880
Pardon me?

310
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,810
My... My major?

311
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,180
It's...

312
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,380
- Cello. - Cello?

313
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,280
Cello?

314
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,610
I see. You're a music student.

315
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,880
I should have known.

316
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,110
To be honest, I was a little surprised when I first saw you.

317
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,680
It's not easy for a woman to carry something like that...

318
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,740
unless she has strong arms, you know?

319
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,510
You could probably do it because you're used to carrying a cello.

320
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,540
- Aren't I right? - Well...

321
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,340
Yes. I guess you can say that.

322
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,380
I'd love to hear you playing your cello someday.

323
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,950
As you can probably tell, I'm an avid fan of classical music.

324
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,780
I go to recitals often, too.

325
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,610
Of course I'm just an amateur compared to you.

326
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,610
By the way,

327
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,210
do all cellists...

328
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,180
It's okay. You should answer it.

329
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,980
I don't have to.

330
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,450
Yes, Bok Joo. Where are you now?

331
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,780
- Why do you ask? - What do you think?

332
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,910
I'm going to your school now and want to bring you some chicken.

333
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,080
- Are you at the dormitory? - No, I'm not.

334
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,910
Then I'll leave it in your room. Share it with your friends. Bye.

335
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:02,640
No, don't.

336
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,610
Hello, hello?

337
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,180
Sorry, something urgent has just come up.

338
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,540
I'll be sure to follow the diet.

339
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,580
Thank you, Doctor.

340
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:43,640
Gosh, Dad will find out everything if he meets them.

341
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,450
- Hey, watch out! - Hey, stop.

342
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,980
Are you out of your mind?

343
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,840
I'm sorry, but can you get me to the dormitory? Please. Hurry up.

344
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,440
Woman, this isn't a taxi.

345
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:59,480
Look at that. What's that in your hair? Is it a dragonfly or what?

346
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,610
What is that?

347
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,440
Hey, I'm in a rush. Please help me. Please?

348
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,480
Hurry up. Hurry up. Come on!

349
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,280
Gosh, you're such a nuisance.

350
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,910
Hey, I'm in a huge rush.

351
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,340
- Just a second. - Hurry up.

352
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,480
- Goodness. - Go, go.

353
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,140
- Hurry up. - My gosh!

354
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,980
Hurry up already.

355
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,740
- Go faster. - Why are you hitting me?

356
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,180
Hey, go faster!

357
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,880
- Gosh, you're so heavy! - Hey!

358
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,280
Go faster, please.

359
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,440
- Hurry up. Go faster. - You're really heavy.

360
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,740
Chubs, you're making my life so difficult.

361
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,980
Go faster, seriously!

362
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,780
Oh, my gosh.

363
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,580
Hey, you're not even going to thank me?

364
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,980
Dad!

365
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,840
Does she think that I'm her driver?

366
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,280
The seat totally collapsed.

367
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,640
Gosh. Dad, Dad!

368
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,640
- Dad, Dad. - My goodness.

369
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,580
You didn't have to run. I could've just left it with someone upstairs.

370
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,580
This is an all-girls dormitory. No men are allowed here.

371
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,080
Am I considered a man?

372
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,140
I come here often for deliveries, so even the housemistress knows me.

373
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,580
No one even stops me.

374
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,540
All right. Just give it to me and go.

375
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,940
Okay, fine. I'm a busy man, too.

376
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,240
I won't stay even if you ask me to.

377
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,740
Go. Get going already.

378
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,510
Hey, it looks like all of your hard training is paying off.

379
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:40,310
Your arms have gotten stronger. You could probably carry me.

380
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,780
Why are you so chatty today?

381
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,180
- Go and earn money, which you love. - Money?

382
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,880
Yes, you're right. I should go earn money. Enjoy the chicken.

383
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,780
Overall, the test result shows...

384
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,710
that your stress level is quite high.

385
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,310
You're an athlete,

386
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:10,440
so being in that kind of competitive environment must be stressful.

387
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,280
By any chance, are there any specific symptoms...

388
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,380
you experience on the day of a match?

389
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,680
My heart beats so fast as if it's about to burst,

390
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:31,040
and all sounds around me get muffled gradually.

391
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,210
And eventually, I can't hear anything.

392
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,810
It feels as if everything has been muted.

393
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,410
You can't hear anything?

394
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,340
Do you experience it only during matches?

395
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,610
Usually. But it also happened during a few training sessions recently.

396
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,940
I saw an ENT doctor and was told that my ears are fine.

397
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,440
They must be fine. It's more psychological.

398
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:00,040
Symptoms like that usually occur after a big shock...

399
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,080
or a traumatic experience.

400
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,140
It could be a type of panic disorder or conversion disorder.

401
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,810
That's what I think.

402
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,310
Then...

403
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,140
try to remember when you first experienced the symptoms.

404
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,980
Did anything happen around that time to trigger such symptoms?

405
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,710
I'm not sure. Nothing specific is coming to my mind.

406
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,410
From what I see,

407
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,880
you're a highly defensive person.

408
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,340
You don't like to expose your vulnerabilities,

409
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:37,910
and you suppress everything.

410
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,340
You probably don't want to see what's inside of you.

411
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,310
No, I'm really not that complicated.

412
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,480
See? You're in denial.

413
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,980
Oh, boy. I'm in trouble.

414
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,040
Patients like you are the most difficult ones to treat.

415
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,740
Nevertheless,

416
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,640
you must get it out of yourself.

417
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,180
Only then, I'll be able to help you.

418
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,440
On that note,

419
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,240
I think we should get to know each other better.

420
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,940
How about coffee?

421
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:05,980
Okay.

422
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:29,680
Try to remember when you first experienced the symptoms.

423
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,380
Did anything happen around that time to trigger such symptoms?

424
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,810
(I miss you, Joon Hyung. Merry Christmas! Love, Mom)

425
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,510
What?

426
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,810
Why are you here?

427
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,580
- Did you come here because of me? - That's right.

428
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,510
I came to make sure you take the counseling seriously.

429
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,210
Come on. You're lying.

430
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:26,110
I had a seminar nearby. I came to pick you up.

431
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,080
You did come to keep an eye on me. Am I right?

432
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,340
How is the counseling going?

433
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,010
Fine. He seems like a good doctor.

434
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,310
He sees right through me.

435
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,740
I told you he's a famous doctor.

436
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,940
I know. He's a great doctor.

437
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,180
Don't worry. I won't embarrass you.

438
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,210
Where's your car?

439
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,910
Let's go.

440
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:57,940
What's that?

441
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,180
It's your umbrella I borrowed before.

442
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,040
What?

443
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,010
Why did you put it in a bag like this?

444
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,080
You didn't have to.

445
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,340
The person I lent it to put it in there.

446
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,840
Who?

447
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,110
Is it a girl?

448
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,610
It is a girl,

449
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,340
but she's just my patient. She's a cellist.

450
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,680
She goes to a music school?

451
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,240
Of course. Men have...

452
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,540
a fantasy towards girls who study music, right?

453
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,080
Don't make things up.

454
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,610
I don't fall for a patient.

455
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,580
So tell me about her.

456
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,210
Is she pretty?

457
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:39,280
Gosh. She's quite pretty.

458
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,710
Really?

459
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,440
I should pay a visit, then.

460
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,110
Tell me what time her session is.

461
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,540
You're here.

462
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,110
- What's that? Is it food? - No.

463
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,040
Did you get a present? It must be from a girl.

464
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,710
I lent my umbrella to my brother, and he gave it back to me.

465
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,540
Are you satisfied?

466
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,180
It has flower patterns.

467
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,980
Your brother has a weird taste.

468
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,410
What's this? You're busted.

469
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,010
Your brother wouldn't have written it. Liar.

470
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,340
It's not mine.

471
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,310
Thank you, Dr. Jeong.

472
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,380
What you gave me isn't an umbrella but your kind heart.

473
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,880
Goodness.

474
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,840
Jae Yi has seduced a naive college girl again.

475
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,480
She's one smitten cellist.

476
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,810
A cellist? Who is that?

477
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,310
She's the same person.

478
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,310
Ms. Flower Pattern.

479
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,180
How do you know Joon Hyung?

480
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,040
We went to the same elementary school.

481
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,480
He transferred to another school, so we didn't graduate together.

482
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,610
Do you know he was my boyfriend?

483
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,280
Yes. My friends told me.

484
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,610
You have an unusual taste in men.

485
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,210
We must be deeply connected somehow.

486
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,410
It's funny.

487
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,040
(J Weight Clinic)

488
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,080
Belly fat...

489
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,310
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors.

490
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,180
Thank you for the meal in advance.

491
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,440
Thank you so much.

492
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,640
Hey, hey.

493
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,680
Bok Joo.

494
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,580
Isn't it too early to be excited like that?

495
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,440
You little brats. Captain.

496
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,280
Isn't Woon Gi here?

497
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:57,110
He got a call last night. He went out and didn't come back.

498
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,440
Are you saying he stayed out without telling me?

499
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,040
Yes.

500
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:04,740
- Sang Chul. Take the lead. - Yes, Coach.

501
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,080
Go.

502
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,240
Gather up.

503
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,640
Gather up. Run.

504
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,540
Hurry up and run, you brats.

505
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,240
- Go, weightlifters. - Let's go.

506
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,780
What's going on with Woon Gi?

507
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,640
- Is there meat? - It's here.

508
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,610
Give this to me and get yourself another.

509
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,410
I'm too lazy.

510
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,340
Give it back right now.

511
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,840
What's going on? It's normal amount.

512
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,480
You should stack food up like mountains,

513
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,540
such as the Rocky Mountains, the Alps, and the Himalayas.

514
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:47,610
It actually looks like you've lost some weight.

515
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:52,180
- Has she lost weight? - Of course not.

516
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,080
- Maybe she has. - Hey. That's enough.

517
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,310
- Stop joking and give it back. - No.

518
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,440
Give it to me.

519
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,040
- Give it back! - Get yourself another.

520
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,940
- Give it to me! - No.

521
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,280
Bok Joo, let's go.

522
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,410
- Joon Hyung. I'll get you one. - It's mine! What's wrong with you?

523
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,210
"What's wrong with you?"

524
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,810
- "What's wrong with you?" - Goodness.

525
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,280
- Give it to me! - Joon Hyung.

526
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,310
Give it back.

527
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,110
- Cut it out. - Give me that.

528
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,180
- Guys. - What's the matter with you?

529
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,010
- Get yourself another. - Stop it already.

530
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,180
- You'll make me spill. - Give it back.

531
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,340
Let it go.

532
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,980
Bok Joo. What are you doing?

533
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,310
Bok Joo is my roommate.

534
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,740
Didn't you know?

535
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,980
It feels good to eat with many people.

536
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,310
Gymnasts skip meals very often.

537
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,540
I only eat lunch here from time to time.

538
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,080
- Okay. - I see.

539
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,240
Joon Hyung.

540
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,140
You look a bit thin.

541
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,740
You should eat well.

542
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,210
That's right.

543
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,480
You like acorn jelly, right?

544
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,340
You can have mine.

545
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,110
I try to eat vegetables only.

546
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,210
Excuse me. I have things to do.

547
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,180
I'll be going, too. Enjoy your lunch.

548
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,080
Do you have to do this?

549
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,440
Can't we have a meal together?

550
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,110
We can.

551
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,340
But...

552
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:52,040
I don't want to make other people uncomfortable.

553
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,440
You're always so selfish.

554
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,710
Let's get back together.

555
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:09,880
I want to get back together.

556
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,680
It has to be you.

557
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,680
You are...

558
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,910
I know. You must think it's ridiculous.

559
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:20,380
I broke up with you.

560
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,980
But...

561
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,580
things were so hard back then.

562
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,940
That competition was so important, but I wasn't getting better.

563
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,780
That's right, Eun Young.

564
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,010
Look at the ball. Good.

565
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,740
Si Ho. Balance yourself on one leg.

566
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,140
Raise your leg higher.

567
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,310
Push it back, and hold it.

568
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,440
Keep this up, and you'll never make the national team.

569
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,010
Your balance is all off.

570
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,910
Why are you getting worse every day?

571
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,210
You should be getting better.

572
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,240
If you mess this up, you'll be done.

573
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,510
You'll have to retire before making the national team.

574
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,040
(Joon Hyung)

575
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,040
Let's break up.

576
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,410
What?

577
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,140
Let's break up.

578
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,640
I want to focus on my training.

579
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:31,310
I know you're upset because you didn't win the competition.

580
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,910
But I have my own fish to fry. I should focus on myself.

581
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,480
You keep bothering me. It's annoying.

582
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,110
I don't want to be...

583
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,380
your girlfriend any more.

584
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,140
I guess you had your reasons.

585
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,210
But that day...

586
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,850
On that day at least,

587
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,540
I was having a harder time.

588
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,140
I got disqualified. I wanted to kill myself.

589
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,180
But you...

590
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,410
You didn't even have a little decency.

591
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,810
You're right.

592
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,440
I was too impatient. I couldn't comfort your pain.

593
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,610
I'm sorry.

594
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,940
It was my fault.

595
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,480
I was too selfish.

596
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,310
I'll be good to you from now on.

597
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:26,680
Please...

598
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,310
Let's get back together.

599
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,710
Please?

600
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,940
Do you think I'm that easy?

601
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,180
I'm leaving.

602
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:45,980
Joon Hyung, I'm sorry.

603
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,810
- Gosh, I have indigestion. - I couldn't eat properly.

604
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,940
What happened back there?

605
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,980
- Are they back together? - I don't think so.

606
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,610
Maybe that's what Si Ho wants.

607
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,350
Who knows what's really happening between them?

608
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,580
They could be arguing out of love.

609
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,610
(Ms. Kim Bok Joo, you have an appointment tomorrow at 7pm.)

610
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:08,640
Don't you agree, Bok Joo?

611
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,610
Hey.

612
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,910
- What are you reading? - It's just a spam.

613
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,580
Let's hurry. We'll be late for training.

614
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,140
Look, there's Woon Gi.

615
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,640
- Oh, my. - I think he just came back.

616
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:23,210
I don't know what's going on, but they'll be angry with him again.

617
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,440
Let's keep quiet.

618
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:26,680
Let's go.

619
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,440
I heard that in Goyang,

620
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,080
they reached the quota already.

621
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,080
- Aren't we hopeless, then? - What are you talking about?

622
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,680
That isn't the only semi-professional team.

623
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:38,140
Hey, Woon Gi!

624
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,140
- Where have you been? - I'm sorry.

625
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,780
Let me talk to Professor Yoon and Coach Choi first.

626
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,410
Are you just going to ignore us?

627
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:51,540
Do you have some good news?

628
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:53,580
You seem to be in a good mood.

629
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,310
I'm sure you have something to say,

630
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,240
but let's talk later.

631
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,540
Gosh, he's so annoying.

632
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,880
As a captain, if you broke the rules to get off campus...

633
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,640
and missed the morning training,

634
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,380
shouldn't you at least give us some kind of explanation?

635
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,680
We're your colleagues.

636
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,210
Sang Chul is right.

637
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,380
Do I have to report my personal issues?

638
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,880
We were never close as colleagues.

639
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,080
I didn't want to be petty and say this,

640
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:19,910
but did you get an offer from a semi-professional team recently?

641
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,280
Did you go visit one of them?

642
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,980
- What is he talking about? - What did I expect?

643
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,240
Why would an ace like yourself...

644
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,240
care about what we weaklings think?

645
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,680
Fine, just ignore us.

646
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,080
You're such a traitor.

647
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,380
I have no idea what you're talking about.

648
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,910
- Wait, I... - Hey.

649
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,310
We aren't done talking. Where do you think you're going?

650
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:42,810
- I have to answer the phone. - Move out of the way.

651
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,580
Is it a coach calling?

652
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,680
- Give it back to me, you punk. - You want to start this?

653
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,510
- Please don't do it. - Stop it.

654
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,380
- What's wrong with you? - Why you...

655
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,040
Have they lost their mind?

656
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,910
- Come on, stop it. - Hey, what's going on?

657
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:55,940
What's going on?

658
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:58,880
What are you doing?

659
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,240
Hold it correctly. Lower your bottoms.

660
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,740
It's additional 10 minutes each time someone falls.

661
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,810
You've lost your mind.

662
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:21,510
Do you think I worked hard to train you...

663
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:24,410
so that you can get into fights? You punks.

664
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:26,240
You need to grow up first.

665
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,040
Hold it!

666
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:31,380
If you can't even hold it for this long,

667
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,350
you'd better quit weightlifting. My goodness.

668
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,380
Coach Choi, they should be trained much harder...

669
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,680
so that they're too exhausted...

670
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,580
to not get into this kind of nonsense.

671
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:44,380
When I went to Atlanta to train for the Olympics,

672
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,980
something like this could never happen. You know why?

673
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,910
We were too exhausted from training to get into any kind of fight.

674
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:53,180
They should just be busy with their training. I'm so disappointed.

675
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,040
He's giving me a headache.

676
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,810
Don't you see what's going on?

677
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,280
Professor Yoon is very upset.

678
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,140
- Keep up the good work. - We can do it.

679
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,210
- Thank you. - Thank you.

680
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,310
Good job, everyone.

681
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:28,440
Everyone, get up.

682
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,940
Do some stretching and come outside.

683
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,980
(15 minutes before the appointment)

684
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:56,280
Why aren't you sitting down?

685
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,380
You need some meat after wasting your energy.

686
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:04,010
What are you doing? The seniors should barbecue the meat.

687
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:06,140
The rest of you can set the table and take a seat.

688
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,380
- Yes, Coach. - Yes, Coach.

689
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:11,040
Come on, let's go.

690
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:14,980
Actually,

691
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,380
I have diabetes.

692
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,610
My doctor told me not to eat meat.

693
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,350
However, I still eat it.

694
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,610
I can be healthier by giving up meat,

695
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,480
but I'd rather eat what I enjoy.

696
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,710
I'd rather live a happier life than a healthy one. That's my belief.

697
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,180
I hope that...

698
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,240
you'll live that way, too.

699
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,940
Instead of being happy for making it to the national team and winning,

700
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,580
I hope that weightlifting makes you happy.

701
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,780
Some coaches might laugh...

702
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:54,980
at what I just said.

703
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,180
However,

704
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,280
I don't want you...

705
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:04,240
to give up weightlifting because you damaged your body too much...

706
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,810
just to win a gold medal.

707
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,350
If your goal is to win a medal,

708
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,510
and if you don't, you'd be unhappy.

709
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,140
However, if you simply love...

710
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,440
lifting that cold, heavy metal,

711
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:21,680
wouldn't you be happy by simply lifting weights?

712
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:26,980
I'm sorry.

713
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,280
I'm sorry.

714
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:35,980
I know all of you are having a hard time...

715
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,310
these days,

716
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:39,850
especially the seniors.

717
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,380
I'm sure you're worried.

718
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,380
However,

719
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:47,640
you have to wait until the end of the game for the results.

720
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,480
Just like that,

721
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,010
you have no idea how your life will turn out.

722
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,380
During the last half of a soccer game,

723
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,040
you might turn off the TV thinking that the team already lost.

724
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:59,980
Right then, the team makes a goal.

725
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,040
You must watch it until the end.

726
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,680
If you do that, you'll win.

727
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,240
Gosh, I can't seem to stop talking today.

728
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:23,480
Meanwhile, the meat is getting burnt.

729
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:27,580
That's all I have to say. Let's eat!

730
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:30,610
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

731
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,210
- Here. - Thank you.

732
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,850
- Set up the table. - Here you go.

733
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:36,010
- Hey. - I'll do it.

734
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:39,740
(10 minutes before the appointment)

735
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,580
It reeks of meat.

736
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:45,380
Order more meat if we need more.

737
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,880
I talked to Mr. Jung about it.

738
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:49,380
- Is it out of your own pocket? - Watch it.

739
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:53,180
I'm sorry for getting out of line.

740
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:56,510
Professor Yoon, Coach Choi.

741
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,910
I'm sorry, but I have to step out for a while.

742
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,610
I was going to talk to you in private. What's going on?

743
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:04,940
- What's going on? - You can go.

744
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,010
Will you be back before the roll call?

745
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:08,240
Yes, of course.

746
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:11,240
- Is everything okay? - Yes, it's fine.

747
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,280
See you tomorrow.

748
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,210
Okay.

749
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,380
- But... - Coach Choi.

750
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,880
Trusting them is a way to support them.

751
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,080
This is Bok Joo, and I have an appointment at 7pm.

752
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,180
I'm sorry, but I'm running a little late.

753
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:39,180
Of course I'm on my way.

754
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,780
I'll be right there. See you soon.

755
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:51,080
My goodness, it's raining.

756
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,880
Gosh.

757
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:55,140
Goodness.

758
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,340
I'm sorry to keep you at work.

759
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,910
It's okay. I'm usually here at this hour.

760
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:33,710
Did you get wet again?

761
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,240
It must look obvious. Does it look bad?

762
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,380
That's not what I mean.

763
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:41,710
You should stay out of the rain.

764
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,580
You'll catch a cold.

765
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,880
You must be in good condition to take good care of yourself.

766
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,710
I'll do that, Doctor.

767
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:55,040
You did a great job.

768
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:57,780
Without any muscle loss, you've lost 200g of body fat.

769
00:45:58,610 --> 00:45:59,780
Did you stick to a good diet?

770
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,440
Really?

771
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:04,080
I don't think I kept it very strictly.

772
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,610
I'm telling you the truth. Why wouldn't you believe me?

773
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:09,980
Take a look.

774
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:15,010
This is your body mass index graph.

775
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,040
This is your body fat, and...

776
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,440
Bok Joo?

777
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:54,610
Sorry?

778
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:56,710
Oh, yes. Of course.

779
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:58,640
- What was I saying? - Pardon me?

780
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,680
Sorry?

781
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:05,240
I was going to reward you, but you blew your chance.

782
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:09,610
No, I wasn't thinking about something else.

783
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:13,140
I was just too immersed in the music.

784
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:16,110
Oh, right. That...

785
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,180
"J.B. Breval Sonata".

786
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,080
I heard that it's like "Czerny New Studies"...

787
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,910
to cellists.

788
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:25,710
Of course.

789
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:29,410
Breval... I heard it so many times that I almost know it by heart.

790
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,240
It's such a long etude, though.

791
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,840
How long do you have to practice...

792
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,780
in order to master it and play it like you?

793
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,310
It depends on the person.

794
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,040
I guess...

795
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:48,910
- about 3... - For 3 months?

796
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:50,010
From 3 months to 4, 5 or 6 years?

797
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,380
When it comes to cello, the difference can be big.

798
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,440
Yes, you're right.

799
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:58,880
Bok Joo.

800
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,640
Then...

801
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:02,480
shall we start the treatment?

802
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,040
Sure.

803
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:24,380
- This way, please. - Okay.

804
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:29,740
I'm hungry.

805
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:33,340
We could've gotten more if it didn't start pouring.

806
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,740
I know. Why did it start raining all of a sudden?

807
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,810
Hey, where is Bok Joo by the way? She didn't say where she was going.

808
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,440
I guess she's doing deliveries.

809
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:44,010
That girl is so busy.

810
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:48,340
Don't you think that we should try to be better friends to her?

811
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:52,640
We've had so much fried chicken at her dad's restaurant, you know.

812
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:54,240
I guess you're right.

813
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:57,510
Shall we go help them serve their customers?

814
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:01,310
- Best friends! - Best friends!

815
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,610
We're seriously so slow today.

816
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:13,340
By the way, why are you so quiet these days?

817
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:15,640
Your boss hasn't called you?

818
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:18,710
I made a scene and asked for money. Would you call me if you were him?

819
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:24,180
By the way, why does Bok Joo never come by these days?

820
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,440
I told her to focus on training.

821
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,110
She has to start preparing for the upcoming tournament soon.

822
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,180
I actually miss her now that I haven't seen her for a while.

823
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:35,610
My troublemaker niece.

824
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:39,210
Gosh, hold on. I have to go to the bathroom.

825
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,940
That little... How dare he call her a troublemaker!

826
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,480
Hello.

827
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,880
- Hello! - My gosh!

828
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:48,580
Look who's here. I haven't seen you girls in a while.

829
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:49,980
Where is Bok Joo?

830
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:51,380
She's not here?

831
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,740
Why would she be here at this hour? Is she not at school?

832
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:56,340
- I thought... - I just remembered...

833
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:59,580
Bok Joo told me that she was going to a sauna. I totally forgot.

834
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,210
Gosh, I'm so forgetful these days.

835
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,240
Take care, Mr. Kim.

836
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,540
- Take care. - Bye, girls.

837
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,140
Hey, what was that about?

838
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,740
Where did she go, then?

839
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:15,040
Who knows? Gosh, I can't believe this.

840
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,110
That sly fox.

841
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:19,110
We've been completely fooled.

842
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,610
Kim Bok Joo, I shall teach you a lesson.

843
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,780
Hey, girls. Why are you here?

844
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:50,940
Are you going somewhere?

845
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,140
No, we've been waiting for you.

846
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,480
You're late. Where have you been?

847
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:58,380
What do you think? I was out doing deliveries.

848
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:02,140
We were so busy. Orders kept coming in nonstop.

849
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:03,710
Don't you dare lie to our faces.

850
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:05,880
We were just at Bok Chicken.

851
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,110
There wasn't a single soul there,

852
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,640
and your dad thought you were here.

853
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:12,780
You better tell us the truth.

854
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:14,880
What's keeping you so busy these days?

855
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,910
Where on earth were you?

856
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:18,710
You better tell us. Don't even think about lying.

857
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:22,140
Actually, I was...

858
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,080
- Go on. - What is it?

859
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:26,880
I was...

860
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:37,380
I kept it from you guys because I was too embarrassed to tell you.

861
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:39,710
We're best friends. Why would you feel embarrassed...

862
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:47,140
Is it that thing again?

863
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:49,680
Did you go to see a doctor because of it?

864
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:51,380
Is that really what's happening?

865
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:54,210
You should've just told us. It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

866
00:51:57,210 --> 00:51:58,480
I know, but...

867
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,240
What did the doctor say? Is it really bad?

868
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:05,440
Do you need surgery?

869
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,840
No, it's not that serious.

870
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:09,810
Thank goodness.

871
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:12,080
You should still be careful from now on.

872
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,440
- You have to watch what you eat. - Yes, I should.

873
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:19,280
I didn't want to worry my dad, you know.

874
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:22,310
It's probably going to get better soon, so I didn't tell you.

875
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,340
Still, you should've told us.

876
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,180
We were so worried about you.

877
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:29,940
Yes. We'll get mad at you if you keep another secret from us.

878
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:32,440
Okay. I'm sorry.

879
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,980
- Be careful, okay? - Did you get medication for it?

880
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:45,280
I guess lying also requires practice.

881
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,740
The more you lie, the better you get.

882
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:59,140
"Bach Cello Suite Number One".

883
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:01,640
Pre... Pre...

884
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,480
How do I pronounce this word?

885
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,510
It's okay. Don't turn it off.

886
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:14,540
I guess you like classical music, too.

887
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:16,510
Well, yes. A little.

888
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:19,310
About Joon Hyung...

889
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:21,110
Isn't he charming?

890
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:23,580
He makes you laugh.

891
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:25,910
He comes across as aloof, but he's actually very caring.

892
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,440
I'm not sure about that. I haven't noticed that about him.

893
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:33,710
To be honest, I want to get back together with him,

894
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,880
but he's not opening up to me.

895
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,480
I broke his heart in the past.

896
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,980
Will you be able to help me if I ever need your help?

897
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,280
Me?

898
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:48,710
I'm not sure how I can help you, though.

899
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,640
Why not?

900
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,910
You and Joon Hyung seem very close.

901
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,410
Gosh, no way. We're not close at all.

902
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:58,480
All right, I heard you.

903
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:10,440
I bluffed in front of our students,

904
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:12,710
but I'm very worried these days.

905
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:17,280
I'm worried that they might get no offers and become unemployed.

906
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:21,310
I hear you. We should start to receive some offers by now.

907
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:25,210
I guess it's because our team's performance wasn't great last year.

908
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:28,840
We only have the tournament and a couple of matches left.

909
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,640
They must be frustrated, too.

910
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:33,980
I mean, their lives depend on this.

911
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,110
Professor Yoon, on that note...

912
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,510
I've been thinking about it and...

913
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,180
You'll be discharged tomorrow, right?

914
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:55,240
You can't even go to a postnatal care center.

915
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:56,980
Doing everything alone will be hard.

916
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,210
It's okay.

917
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,310
We can't afford things like that.

918
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:04,910
I can do it alone. I already bought seaweed, too.

919
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:12,610
Just a second.

920
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,480
Yes, Professor Yoon.

921
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:18,540
My weight class?

922
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:19,640
Yes.

923
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:23,140
Well, it's Coach Choi's idea.

924
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:25,580
We know...

925
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:28,640
that gaining weight and muscle mass isn't an easy thing to do.

926
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:33,310
But if we do it, winning a medal will become easier for you.

927
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:37,740
And Jung Woo will be able to aim for a medal, too.

928
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:41,110
I'll think about it.

929
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:43,840
Okay, sure. Give it some thought.

930
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:45,710
We can talk about it again later.

931
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,080
All right.

932
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:50,580
One more thing, Professor Yoon.

933
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,580
Let's call one more person.

934
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:54,410
Just a second.

935
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:00,710
My goodness.

936
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:46,480
- Bok Joo's weight class? - Yes.

937
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:50,180
I've given it a lot of thoughts.

938
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,040
It's possible.

939
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:54,880
In women's 63kg, no one can beat Bok Joo.

940
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,310
She will own it.

941
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,140
If Bok Joo raises her weight class,

942
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:00,710
she will be more likely to win a medal.

943
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:02,680
Girls in 58kg will have...

944
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,480
a better hope for a medal as well.

945
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,210
It can be a win-win situation.

946
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:10,510
The remaining competition, especially for the seniors,

947
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:12,140
is so important...

948
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,140
for their career.

949
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:15,880
In fact, a senior named Woon Gi...

950
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,180
is considering a weight increase as well.

951
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:21,910
I get what you're saying,

952
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:23,910
but...

953
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:27,180
raising weight is even harder than lowering it.

954
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:37,110
(Weight on November 23rd: 57.12kg, Weight on November 24th: 56.80kg)

955
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:39,140
You lost 300g again.

956
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:41,810
I really should give you a prize.

957
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,510
You're doing great.

958
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:45,210
You don't have to.

959
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,210
What will you give me?

960
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:50,780
I'm not sure. What would be good?

961
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:53,080
It should be something you want.

962
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,280
Give it some thoughts. Please go and change.

963
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:01,180
Okay, Doctor.

964
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,210
What are you doing here, Chubs?

965
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:34,280
What... What are you wearing?

966
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:37,040
- Why? - Joon Hyung.

967
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:40,280
What brings you here?

968
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:41,980
Hi, Jae Yi.

969
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:43,440
What?

970
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:49,280
- Do you two know each other? - Yes.

971
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:50,910
She and I go to...

972
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,780
(Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo)

973
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:08,910
The cellist I told you about is Bok Joo.

974
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,880
You have arms of an athlete.

975
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,840
She likes soccer. Messi, in particular.

976
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,540
Chubs. I want this. Get me water, too.

977
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:17,710
- What happened with Joon Hyung? - Let's talk.

978
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,640
I'm sorry for liking your brother.

979
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:21,510
Do you like my brother that much?

980
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:23,440
Why? What do you like about him?

981
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,080
- Is Jae Yi seeing someone? - Today is D-day.

982
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,140
Doctor.
