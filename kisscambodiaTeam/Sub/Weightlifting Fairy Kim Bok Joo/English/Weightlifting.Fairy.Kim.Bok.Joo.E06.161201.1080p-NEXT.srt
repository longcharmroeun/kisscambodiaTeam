1
00:00:12,392 --> 00:00:14,932
- Hi, Mom. 
- Jae Yi. Are you going to be late?

2
00:00:15,162 --> 00:00:16,162
No, I won't be late.

3
00:00:16,162 --> 00:00:18,162
Do you remember the dumplings we ate the other day?

4
00:00:18,392 --> 00:00:20,362
- You mean the dim sum? 
- Yes, that one.

5
00:00:20,362 --> 00:00:22,192
- I'll buy some on my way home. 
- Okay.

6
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:23,792
All right.

7
00:00:30,492 --> 00:00:31,492
You must be bored.

8
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:34,232
Do you want some gum?

9
00:00:36,432 --> 00:00:38,962
It's sugar-free, so don't worry.

10
00:00:39,492 --> 00:00:40,562
Okay.

11
00:00:51,732 --> 00:00:53,362
I don't have water in my car.

12
00:00:54,432 --> 00:00:58,032
It's okay. Don't worry. I'll just hold my breath.

13
00:01:13,632 --> 00:01:14,932
Gosh, I was so silly.

14
00:01:20,932 --> 00:01:22,992
Things were going great, and I blew it.

15
00:01:24,232 --> 00:01:25,232
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

16
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:27,562
I couldn't find a convenience store.

17
00:01:27,662 --> 00:01:29,762
I got a warm beverage from the vending machine.

18
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,592
Here you go.

19
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:36,262
Thank you.

20
00:01:40,692 --> 00:01:42,192
How is it? Are you okay now?

21
00:01:44,432 --> 00:01:45,532
I think so.

22
00:01:49,562 --> 00:01:51,292
The wind is cold in the morning and evening.

23
00:01:53,132 --> 00:01:54,732
You're wearing thin clothes.

24
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:02,092
You still have hiccups. Drink some more.

25
00:02:09,202 --> 00:02:10,292
Drink some more.

26
00:02:11,032 --> 00:02:13,362
You can drink as much as you want. It's just tea.

27
00:02:15,762 --> 00:02:19,232
(Episode 6, Long Tails Either Get Caught or Get Stepped on)

28
00:02:29,862 --> 00:02:32,202
I started to learn swimming when I was 11 years old.

29
00:02:33,732 --> 00:02:36,202
I was a lonely, awkward,

30
00:02:37,202 --> 00:02:38,762
and nervous kid.

31
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,762
To me, water felt like the only safe place.

32
00:02:43,362 --> 00:02:44,432
Just like...

33
00:02:45,592 --> 00:02:46,732
being in the arms of my mom.

34
00:02:54,732 --> 00:02:57,932
In fact, I was left with my uncle's family when I was 10...

35
00:02:59,362 --> 00:03:01,332
as my mom got remarried and went to Canada.

36
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:04,192
So the parents you have now are...

37
00:03:04,932 --> 00:03:07,992
They're my aunt and uncle. Jae Yi is my cousin.

38
00:03:10,092 --> 00:03:11,262
It was okay.

39
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:14,792
My mom sent me presents and post cards every Christmas.

40
00:03:15,392 --> 00:03:17,232
I didn't think I was abandoned.

41
00:03:18,262 --> 00:03:19,962
I believed we'd meet someday.

42
00:03:22,232 --> 00:03:23,262
But...

43
00:03:23,732 --> 00:03:26,392
- Joon Hyung. 
- The rising star...

44
00:03:26,662 --> 00:03:28,192
You got a Christmas present from Canada.

45
00:03:29,362 --> 00:03:30,932
It came a bit early this year.

46
00:03:32,162 --> 00:03:35,092
Maybe she wanted to wish you good luck for your game today.

47
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:39,032
- I'll go and make some snacks. 
- Okay.

48
00:03:41,132 --> 00:03:42,362
Let's see.

49
00:03:47,592 --> 00:03:49,232
How unlucky. I have a game today.

50
00:03:51,192 --> 00:03:53,332
Mom. Do we have waterproof Band-Aids?

51
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:54,862
Are you hurt?

52
00:03:55,862 --> 00:03:58,232
Check the drawers next to the door to my room.

53
00:04:29,332 --> 00:04:30,662
I realized that...

54
00:04:31,232 --> 00:04:34,562
the handwriting on the post cards became different...

55
00:04:34,562 --> 00:04:35,692
after the first three.

56
00:04:36,692 --> 00:04:37,962
It looked like...

57
00:04:38,662 --> 00:04:41,362
someone tried to imitate my mom's handwriting.

58
00:04:43,762 --> 00:04:44,832
It was your aunt.

59
00:04:47,332 --> 00:04:48,362
Is that day...

60
00:04:48,962 --> 00:04:52,192
Yes. It was the day of the game that I had symptoms for the first time.

61
00:04:55,332 --> 00:04:56,362
Thank you.

62
00:04:57,062 --> 00:04:59,032
I'm sure it wasn't easy for you to tell me that.

63
00:05:01,062 --> 00:05:03,632
Do you think it has something to do with my symptoms?

64
00:05:05,592 --> 00:05:06,632
Probably.

65
00:05:07,662 --> 00:05:09,362
Like I told you before...

66
00:05:09,362 --> 00:05:12,592
"Panic disorder and conversion disorder are diseases of the heart."

67
00:05:13,002 --> 00:05:14,562
It can cause hearing problems, too.

68
00:05:20,462 --> 00:05:23,762
I suppose you were quite shocked on that day.

69
00:05:24,632 --> 00:05:26,992
I guess you felt like you lost...

70
00:05:27,492 --> 00:05:30,092
the only connection you had with your mother.

71
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,292
Good.

72
00:05:34,962 --> 00:05:38,232
We now know what might have caused your problem.

73
00:05:38,232 --> 00:05:40,362
Let's take it slow to solve it.

74
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:44,932
Telling me about it may have cured it by half.

75
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:48,292
Then... Let's see.

76
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:50,592
Which method will be...

77
00:05:50,592 --> 00:05:52,992
the most effective for you?

78
00:05:53,632 --> 00:05:55,732
I think we need to do an experiment.

79
00:05:56,562 --> 00:05:59,032
When is your next game?

80
00:06:50,462 --> 00:06:53,132
Thank you for giving me a ride. Please drive safely.

81
00:06:53,132 --> 00:06:56,162
What's wrong with her? What is she wearing?

82
00:06:56,692 --> 00:06:59,192
I set her up with a good chance. She should be wearing...

83
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:02,162
a pretty dress and show off her charms. Only then,

84
00:07:02,362 --> 00:07:05,262
Jae Yi would say, "You look so charming today, Bok Joo."

85
00:07:05,262 --> 00:07:06,492
But with those clothes,

86
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:08,892
it all goes down the drain.

87
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:11,162
Let me drop you off at your house.

88
00:07:11,162 --> 00:07:14,132
It's not polite to let a woman go home by herself at night.

89
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:17,292
No, it's fine. I can go home from here even with my eyes shut.

90
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:19,762
I also need to stop by at the supermarket to buy something.

91
00:07:20,532 --> 00:07:22,262
Okay. I'll see you at the clinic.

92
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:26,092
Don't forget to do some stretches before you go to sleep.

93
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:29,132
Okay. Goodbye.

94
00:07:29,892 --> 00:07:30,992
My goodness.

95
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,562
Gosh, you're going to break your back, Bok Joo.

96
00:07:33,562 --> 00:07:35,432
I can't watch this.

97
00:07:36,932 --> 00:07:39,232
What should I do with you, Bok Joo?

98
00:07:39,932 --> 00:07:41,632
Are you happy, Bok Joo? Are you?

99
00:07:45,092 --> 00:07:46,762
Where is she going?

100
00:07:47,432 --> 00:07:48,792
She never takes the subway.

101
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:16,532
Three.

102
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:17,992
Two.

103
00:08:18,492 --> 00:08:19,532
One.

104
00:08:21,732 --> 00:08:23,362
Okay, there she is.

105
00:08:37,602 --> 00:08:38,962
Did I catch a cold?

106
00:08:38,962 --> 00:08:40,132
It's because of the dress.

107
00:08:41,432 --> 00:08:43,032
Hey, who's this?

108
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:45,632
It's the weightlifting fairy Kim Bok Joo.

109
00:08:46,432 --> 00:08:48,462
Are you watching me 24 hours a day?

110
00:08:48,932 --> 00:08:50,492
Why do we meet every day?

111
00:08:51,132 --> 00:08:52,492
I find it surprising, too.

112
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:53,762
Why do I always see you?

113
00:08:57,462 --> 00:08:58,462
What's that?

114
00:08:58,962 --> 00:09:00,492
It's nothing. It's none of your business.

115
00:09:00,562 --> 00:09:03,962
It looks like you're coming back from a concert.

116
00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:05,192
You didn't go there...

117
00:09:05,192 --> 00:09:08,432
looking unsophisticated by wearing a dress and heels, did you?

118
00:09:08,562 --> 00:09:10,832
No way. I wouldn't wear such an outfit to a concert.

119
00:09:10,932 --> 00:09:12,632
I was checking just in case you did.

120
00:09:13,362 --> 00:09:16,732
My brother despises a fashion style that's too feminine.

121
00:09:18,462 --> 00:09:19,532
Really?

122
00:09:19,662 --> 00:09:20,732
No, I was kidding.

123
00:09:21,732 --> 00:09:24,332
All men like feminine fashion style.

124
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:26,632
Hey.

125
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,432
Are you teasing me because you saw me? You're so evil.

126
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,032
Don't call me evil when I paid for you.

127
00:09:33,662 --> 00:09:35,532
Then why did you tease me?

128
00:09:35,632 --> 00:09:37,862
I spent all of my monthly allowance to buy those tickets.

129
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:40,962
Well, thank you for the tickets.

130
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:43,462
You should thank me.

131
00:09:45,362 --> 00:09:47,732
Did you have a good time with him?

132
00:09:49,102 --> 00:09:50,632
It wasn't bad.

133
00:09:50,892 --> 00:09:53,962
- He drove me, too. 
- You went for a drive?

134
00:09:54,162 --> 00:09:55,492
You did everything, didn't you?

135
00:09:59,102 --> 00:10:00,362
Watch out, Bok Joo!

136
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:21,792
Gosh, that was close.

137
00:10:22,462 --> 00:10:24,692
Thank goodness for my quick motor system.

138
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,362
What was wrong with that driver?

139
00:10:27,562 --> 00:10:28,792
Hey, you!

140
00:10:29,192 --> 00:10:30,192
Come here, you jerk.

141
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:31,532
Joon Hyung!

142
00:10:49,892 --> 00:10:51,132
Are you leaving?

143
00:10:52,032 --> 00:10:53,062
Why don't you rest some more?

144
00:10:54,592 --> 00:10:56,132
It's okay, I'm fine now.

145
00:10:56,992 --> 00:10:59,732
You had a temporary stomach cramp, so I gave you a shot of painkillers.

146
00:11:00,892 --> 00:11:01,892
Here's some antacid.

147
00:11:03,732 --> 00:11:04,962
Remember to take it after eating.

148
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:08,592
Thank you.

149
00:11:08,762 --> 00:11:12,262
Stomach cramps are usually caused by excessive acid due to stress.

150
00:11:12,892 --> 00:11:13,992
Are you stressed out these days?

151
00:11:14,662 --> 00:11:15,732
Yes, a little.

152
00:11:16,262 --> 00:11:17,662
Is it because of a man?

153
00:11:19,132 --> 00:11:21,132
Who is he?

154
00:11:21,532 --> 00:11:24,362
Who is this man making such a beautiful woman sad?

155
00:11:32,562 --> 00:11:34,932
You should dry your hair first. It's all wet.

156
00:11:35,832 --> 00:11:37,932
Whose fault is that? Keep your mouth shut.

157
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:45,562
Give it to me. It'll take forever to dry your hair like that.

158
00:11:45,562 --> 00:11:46,592
Give it back.

159
00:11:46,592 --> 00:11:48,292
Wait, I'll dry it for you.

160
00:11:54,162 --> 00:11:55,232
Gosh.

161
00:11:57,492 --> 00:11:59,962
Goodness, I'm sorry.

162
00:12:12,692 --> 00:12:15,032
Here, do whatever you want with it.

163
00:12:15,432 --> 00:12:17,932
I never asked you to dry my hair, you punk.

164
00:12:19,562 --> 00:12:20,562
Gosh.

165
00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:27,732
Hey.

166
00:12:27,892 --> 00:12:29,632
Do you think Jae Yi noticed...

167
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:30,962
that you like him?

168
00:12:31,562 --> 00:12:33,432
No, I don't think he has any idea.

169
00:12:35,462 --> 00:12:36,732
I don't want him to find out.

170
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:38,832
Men don't like women who does weightlifting.

171
00:12:39,462 --> 00:12:41,032
Look.

172
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,062
It's full of calluses.

173
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,292
Who would like hands full of calluses?

174
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:47,932
What's wrong with that? It's because you do weightlifting.

175
00:12:48,062 --> 00:12:50,362
You can feel safe walking at night.

176
00:12:50,762 --> 00:12:51,992
I'd be happy if I were him.

177
00:12:52,362 --> 00:12:54,062
You're only good with words.

178
00:12:57,232 --> 00:12:59,662
Anyway, I had a good day.

179
00:13:00,162 --> 00:13:01,832
Thanks to you, I went on something similar to a date.

180
00:13:02,792 --> 00:13:04,832
When Dr. Jeong was driving me,

181
00:13:05,032 --> 00:13:07,032
I felt like Cinderella riding her pumpkin carriage.

182
00:13:07,462 --> 00:13:10,062
You know, when the clock hits midnight,

183
00:13:10,062 --> 00:13:11,432
she comes back to reality.

184
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,132
At least, she ends up marrying the prince.

185
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:16,962
You're right.

186
00:13:18,092 --> 00:13:20,792
I don't like watching movies without a happy ending.

187
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:29,292
Did you know...

188
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:31,062
in that fountain...

189
00:13:31,362 --> 00:13:33,192
lives a toad that grants your wishes?

190
00:13:34,262 --> 00:13:35,362
- What? 
- You didn't know?

191
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:38,932
Are you sure you go to Haneol Sport University? It's a famous legend.

192
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:41,362
You know all of our senior athletes who won the gold medal?

193
00:13:41,932 --> 00:13:44,132
All of them won because of the toad.

194
00:13:47,432 --> 00:13:49,292
You should work on your creativity.

195
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,762
I'm being serious.

196
00:13:51,762 --> 00:13:53,062
You may not know it,

197
00:13:53,062 --> 00:13:56,132
but if you pray earnestly enough, he grants your wish no matter what.

198
00:13:56,362 --> 00:13:57,592
Why don't you pray to him...

199
00:13:58,362 --> 00:13:59,762
so that it works out between you and Jae Yi?

200
00:14:00,592 --> 00:14:02,062
You're full of lies.

201
00:14:06,932 --> 00:14:09,292
Did you catch a cold?

202
00:14:09,492 --> 00:14:11,692
My nose has been itching for a while.

203
00:14:12,462 --> 00:14:13,632
I'm sorry,

204
00:14:13,632 --> 00:14:15,792
but I have an important plan to follow, so I can't catch a cold.

205
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:16,792
I'm leaving.

206
00:14:22,732 --> 00:14:23,732
What are you doing?

207
00:14:32,662 --> 00:14:34,762
Gosh, I really can't catch a cold.

208
00:14:35,032 --> 00:14:36,632
It'll last long.

209
00:14:36,932 --> 00:14:39,492
My germs are very strong like me.

210
00:14:39,492 --> 00:14:40,962
It's an awesome virus.

211
00:14:40,962 --> 00:14:43,532
If I really catch a cold,

212
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:44,692
I'm going to...

213
00:14:45,062 --> 00:14:47,632
return the virus by kissing you if I have to.

214
00:14:47,632 --> 00:14:48,632
You wait and see.

215
00:14:50,632 --> 00:14:52,232
Wait for me, Joon Hyung.

216
00:14:52,232 --> 00:14:53,832
Come on, be a loyal friend.

217
00:14:54,362 --> 00:14:56,662
Joon Hyung, wait for me.

218
00:15:10,092 --> 00:15:11,862
I must have caught a cold.

219
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:13,462
It's so annoying.

220
00:15:21,632 --> 00:15:23,792
Are you sick? You look so pale.

221
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:25,592
I'm okay.

222
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,162
I also caught a cold.

223
00:15:27,832 --> 00:15:29,362
Maybe we're unlucky today.

224
00:15:31,262 --> 00:15:32,292
Why doesn't it open?

225
00:15:32,462 --> 00:15:33,632
Here, I'll do it for you.

226
00:15:34,132 --> 00:15:36,492
- It's okay. I'll do it. 
- Come on, give it to me.

227
00:15:36,492 --> 00:15:37,492
I said I will...

228
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:43,532
I'm sorry for being too sensitive.

229
00:15:50,262 --> 00:15:52,362
Even if Bok Joo moves up her weight class,

230
00:15:52,562 --> 00:15:53,862
she'll do well.

231
00:15:55,762 --> 00:15:58,262
Chang Geol, they want more radish.

232
00:16:01,092 --> 00:16:03,632
What are you doing? The chicken is getting burnt.

233
00:16:04,892 --> 00:16:05,962
Oh, my.

234
00:16:06,562 --> 00:16:09,292
It's all burnt. What a waste.

235
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:11,362
Did you fall asleep or something?

236
00:16:12,962 --> 00:16:13,962
No.

237
00:16:15,032 --> 00:16:17,062
I was lost in thoughts.

238
00:16:18,462 --> 00:16:20,932
Focus on strengthening the torso while keeping the same weight.

239
00:16:21,332 --> 00:16:22,732
- Let's increase the number. 
- Okay.

240
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,532
Should we increase the number of consumption of protein as well?

241
00:16:25,762 --> 00:16:27,262
Let Woon Gi decide.

242
00:16:27,492 --> 00:16:28,832
He can adjust it on his own.

243
00:16:30,432 --> 00:16:32,762
I'm glad that Woon Gi decided to move up.

244
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:37,032
Bok Joo doesn't seem probable though, right?

245
00:16:37,862 --> 00:16:40,492
I can't bring it up without Mr. Kim's permission.

246
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:42,062
It'll be hard for Bok Joo to decide as well.

247
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,492
Hello.

248
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:47,792
You came all the way here.

249
00:16:48,332 --> 00:16:50,132
Why didn't you call us? We would have come to you.

250
00:16:51,532 --> 00:16:53,492
I'm sure you know why I'm here.

251
00:16:54,192 --> 00:16:56,632
Let's get down to it since we're both busy.

252
00:16:57,132 --> 00:16:59,062
Okay, I'm listening.

253
00:17:00,332 --> 00:17:02,862
It's about what you mentioned last time.

254
00:17:04,562 --> 00:17:05,592
Bok Joo's weight class.

255
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,762
What do you think is going on?

256
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,162
I have no idea.

257
00:17:14,302 --> 00:17:16,732
I have a bad feeling about it.

258
00:17:18,132 --> 00:17:19,132
I want to know.

259
00:17:19,562 --> 00:17:20,662
I really want to know.

260
00:17:20,962 --> 00:17:22,892
- It's driving me crazy. 
- Stop it.

261
00:17:22,892 --> 00:17:24,662
Stop it. You're making it worse.

262
00:17:25,562 --> 00:17:27,462
Bok Joo, come out now.

263
00:17:28,492 --> 00:17:29,532
Be quiet.

264
00:17:30,192 --> 00:17:31,192
What?

265
00:17:31,362 --> 00:17:32,362
My weight class?

266
00:17:32,862 --> 00:17:33,862
That's right.

267
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:35,302
I'm sure you're surprised.

268
00:17:37,032 --> 00:17:38,862
Of course. I'd be surprised if I were you.

269
00:17:39,062 --> 00:17:40,302
Professor Yoon and I believe...

270
00:17:41,162 --> 00:17:43,302
that you have the potential.

271
00:17:43,592 --> 00:17:47,462
Increasing your weight few months before the competition isn't normal,

272
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:49,632
but you're strong.

273
00:17:50,132 --> 00:17:52,762
Off the records, you've tied with the best record from the 63kg class.

274
00:17:53,132 --> 00:17:55,062
That's when I was in my best condition.

275
00:17:55,062 --> 00:17:56,302
You should make it so.

276
00:17:56,662 --> 00:17:57,962
We'll make sure to help you.

277
00:17:59,062 --> 00:18:00,092
As you know,

278
00:18:00,632 --> 00:18:03,832
the competition for 58kg weight class is fierce.

279
00:18:04,062 --> 00:18:05,932
In your weight class, the result of...

280
00:18:06,032 --> 00:18:08,762
the competition changes drastically depending on your condition.

281
00:18:09,062 --> 00:18:10,132
What about 63kg?

282
00:18:10,862 --> 00:18:14,192
Ever since Jang Ran Ran retired,

283
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:16,232
there's no one who stands out.

284
00:18:16,802 --> 00:18:19,692
I'm not saying this to pressure you,

285
00:18:19,802 --> 00:18:21,432
but if you go up to 63kg,

286
00:18:22,062 --> 00:18:23,432
then other girls...

287
00:18:23,432 --> 00:18:25,662
could try for a medal at 58kg.

288
00:18:25,862 --> 00:18:28,192
Coach Choi is right. It'll be a win-win situation for everyone.

289
00:18:28,562 --> 00:18:31,532
It'll benefit you and create opportunities for team members.

290
00:18:32,232 --> 00:18:34,732
If you can manage to gain 3 to 4kg, it'll be totally possible.

291
00:18:35,332 --> 00:18:38,062
Woon Gi is doing the same thing. We're working on his program now.

292
00:18:38,862 --> 00:18:40,032
If you can make up your mind,

293
00:18:40,802 --> 00:18:42,192
we can give you all the support you need.

294
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,192
But I have to talk to my dad first...

295
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:49,232
We already spoke to him. He gave us a go ahead today.

296
00:18:49,232 --> 00:18:50,262
Pardon?

297
00:18:50,532 --> 00:18:51,592
My dad did?

298
00:18:52,362 --> 00:18:55,162
How can you do that without even talking to me?

299
00:18:55,492 --> 00:18:58,362
You fool. It's not like that was an easy decision for me.

300
00:18:59,462 --> 00:19:01,832
I was tossing and turning all night thinking about what to do.

301
00:19:01,832 --> 00:19:04,832
How can you make such an important decision by yourself?

302
00:19:04,832 --> 00:19:07,732
Do you think going up a weight class is as easy as blowing a balloon?

303
00:19:08,092 --> 00:19:10,562
Bulking up is a lot harder than losing weight.

304
00:19:10,562 --> 00:19:13,232
You must know it, too!

305
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:15,062
I know. I'm obviously aware of it,

306
00:19:15,492 --> 00:19:16,802
but life is a challenge in and of itself.

307
00:19:17,232 --> 00:19:19,332
As a weightlifter, you have to keep challenging yourself.

308
00:19:20,802 --> 00:19:23,492
Professor Yoon is right. This will put you at an advantage.

309
00:19:23,732 --> 00:19:24,892
It's a pretty good strategy.

310
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:27,362
- Dad! 
- I have to deep-fry chicken.

311
00:19:27,362 --> 00:19:28,662
I'm behind on orders. I have to go.

312
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:30,692
- Let's talk later. 
- Dad!

313
00:19:31,432 --> 00:19:34,332
You always do whatever you want! You even hung up on me!

314
00:19:34,432 --> 00:19:36,162
Calm down, Bok Joo.

315
00:19:36,462 --> 00:19:39,802
I know that it'll be difficult, but it's not impossible.

316
00:19:40,132 --> 00:19:41,962
I agree. Gaining 3 to 4kg...

317
00:19:41,962 --> 00:19:43,732
isn't that difficult for you.

318
00:19:43,732 --> 00:19:45,492
That's not it.

319
00:19:45,492 --> 00:19:47,932
Gosh, this is seriously driving me crazy.

320
00:19:47,932 --> 00:19:50,192
Why would you go crazy over this?

321
00:19:50,462 --> 00:19:52,632
We'll help you.

322
00:19:52,632 --> 00:19:54,762
Yes. As good friends, we'll pig out with you.

323
00:19:54,962 --> 00:19:57,962
That's not why I'm upset.

324
00:19:58,092 --> 00:20:00,592
Why does it have to be now? For goodness' sake.

325
00:20:01,062 --> 00:20:02,762
Don't run! It'll make you lose weight.

326
00:20:02,932 --> 00:20:04,862
Hey, Bok Joo. Wait up!

327
00:20:04,862 --> 00:20:07,632
- Dad always does whatever he wants. 
- Calm down.

328
00:20:10,962 --> 00:20:13,632
What? You want to go on the match hosted by Joongang Bank?

329
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,162
Why?

330
00:20:17,162 --> 00:20:19,732
It's a small match. It won't really be helpful for you.

331
00:20:20,132 --> 00:20:21,892
Just as practice.

332
00:20:22,762 --> 00:20:24,062
I see. You're right.

333
00:20:24,062 --> 00:20:26,362
Getting as much practice as possible will help you overcome the anxiety.

334
00:20:27,132 --> 00:20:28,562
I think it's a good idea.

335
00:20:28,992 --> 00:20:30,062
Hey.

336
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:33,432
Use your guts that allowed you to reject being Tae Hoon's partner...

337
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:34,432
to win a medal.

338
00:20:35,362 --> 00:20:38,362
Everyone will badmouth Ronaldo if he scores a goal at a tiny game.

339
00:20:38,632 --> 00:20:41,462
You're getting cheeky again. All right. Do it.

340
00:20:41,832 --> 00:20:42,862
Okay, thank you.

341
00:20:51,692 --> 00:20:55,362
Kim Bok Joo, that girl. She gave me her cold.

342
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:59,732
Why did she have to give me her cold at a time like this?

343
00:21:02,332 --> 00:21:03,362
Hey, Chubs!

344
00:21:13,032 --> 00:21:14,962
Hey, how will you take responsibility for this?

345
00:21:15,362 --> 00:21:17,162
I caught a cold because of you!

346
00:21:17,162 --> 00:21:19,762
I have a match next week. How will you take responsibility for this?

347
00:21:19,762 --> 00:21:22,192
Shut it. My head is already pounding.

348
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:24,132
Is something going on?

349
00:21:25,132 --> 00:21:27,492
I don't even know. Nothing is going my way.

350
00:21:28,032 --> 00:21:29,862
You looked happy until yesterday. What happened?

351
00:21:30,892 --> 00:21:33,532
- I have to move up a weight class. 
- Weight class?

352
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,932
My gosh, Bok Joo! Are you finally moving up to the heavyweight class?

353
00:21:38,692 --> 00:21:40,592
But what is the problem?

354
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:42,892
Hey. Right now, I can't...

355
00:21:43,592 --> 00:21:46,032
You know that I'm in a bind now. I signed up at the clinic, too.

356
00:21:46,032 --> 00:21:48,462
Hey, that's not really an issue.

357
00:21:48,462 --> 00:21:51,362
I mean, you go there to see Jae Yi. Weight loss isn't your goal.

358
00:21:52,032 --> 00:21:54,462
You got to do what you have to do unless you'll quit weightlifting.

359
00:21:55,592 --> 00:21:56,962
That's true, but...

360
00:21:58,332 --> 00:22:01,662
Hey, you're talking as if it's so easy because it's not your problem.

361
00:22:02,032 --> 00:22:03,932
Do you think all things in life are that simple?

362
00:22:04,762 --> 00:22:07,662
Right, you probably have no idea how life really works.

363
00:22:07,892 --> 00:22:10,262
You're from a good family, you're a natural swimmer,

364
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,562
you're good-looking, and girls are all over you.

365
00:22:12,562 --> 00:22:14,732
I was an idiot to expect advice from you.

366
00:22:14,732 --> 00:22:15,992
I'm going, you stuck-up.

367
00:22:20,192 --> 00:22:21,932
I should be the one getting mad at you!

368
00:22:21,932 --> 00:22:23,832
How can you yell at me after giving me your cold?

369
00:22:25,532 --> 00:22:27,962
(Weightlifting Department)

370
00:22:27,962 --> 00:22:30,092
"You got to do what you have to do."

371
00:22:30,092 --> 00:22:32,632
He can say whatever because it's not his problem. What a jerk.

372
00:22:32,762 --> 00:22:33,792
That sly dabbler.

373
00:22:36,992 --> 00:22:38,032
Bok Joo.

374
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:41,362
What's up? What brings you here? What is it?

375
00:22:43,292 --> 00:22:45,532
I left my practice journal here.

376
00:22:48,962 --> 00:22:49,992
I see.

377
00:22:51,232 --> 00:22:53,992
Have you had a chance to give it some thought?

378
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:56,292
Pardon me?

379
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:00,862
Oh, that.

380
00:23:01,132 --> 00:23:03,962
You'll need to start the special training now if you want to bulk up.

381
00:23:04,362 --> 00:23:05,892
We've already come up with the plan.

382
00:23:14,562 --> 00:23:15,592
I see.

383
00:23:15,992 --> 00:23:17,062
Then...

384
00:23:18,162 --> 00:23:20,792
I will... I'll give it a try.

385
00:23:21,262 --> 00:23:22,332
Really?

386
00:23:22,662 --> 00:23:24,262
You want to give it a try? Seriously?

387
00:23:24,962 --> 00:23:27,362
Professor Yoon, Professor Yoon!

388
00:23:28,792 --> 00:23:30,962
Bok Joo wants to give it a try. She has made up her mind.

389
00:23:31,432 --> 00:23:33,762
Is that right, Bok Joo? Are you serious?

390
00:23:36,262 --> 00:23:37,992
You made the right decision.

391
00:23:38,592 --> 00:23:41,662
As we told you the other day, you can certainly do it.

392
00:23:41,932 --> 00:23:45,362
Of course. Who would be able to do it if Bok Joo can't?

393
00:23:45,362 --> 00:23:47,462
Your dad will be so thrilled to hear this.

394
00:23:47,662 --> 00:23:50,932
- Then let's start today. 
- All right.

395
00:23:51,032 --> 00:23:52,532
- I'll train Woon Gi. 
- Okay.

396
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:55,162
You should train Bok Joo, Coach Choi.

397
00:23:55,592 --> 00:23:59,162
Gosh, I must say that it'll also be a competition between us.

398
00:23:59,262 --> 00:24:00,532
Coach Choi, are you confident?

399
00:24:00,932 --> 00:24:02,932
Of course. You know how scary I can be as a coach.

400
00:24:03,832 --> 00:24:05,292
You're scary, indeed.

401
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:07,362
Bok Joo, you better watch out. She might bite you.

402
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:35,432
One more round.

403
00:24:48,232 --> 00:24:49,292
One more.

404
00:24:50,092 --> 00:24:52,892
Coach Choi, I really can't eat any more.

405
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:54,362
There was so much rice.

406
00:24:54,362 --> 00:24:56,462
That's how much you usually eat.

407
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:57,862
You got to go for another round.

408
00:25:19,362 --> 00:25:22,032
It was going so well. Why did you gain weight all of a sudden?

409
00:25:27,362 --> 00:25:30,062
Doctor, it's because I haven't been following the diet.

410
00:25:30,432 --> 00:25:32,562
- The scale isn't broken. 
- It's my fault.

411
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,662
It's all right. Your weight can fluctuate at the beginning.

412
00:25:35,862 --> 00:25:38,032
But I'm going to give you two different types of treatment today.

413
00:25:38,692 --> 00:25:39,762
Lie down.

414
00:25:42,492 --> 00:25:43,492
That's odd.

415
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:46,732
Your weight went up by 1kg yesterday.

416
00:25:47,632 --> 00:25:48,862
Why did you lose 0.5kg?

417
00:25:50,162 --> 00:25:51,192
Hey, Bok Joo.

418
00:25:52,362 --> 00:25:53,362
Did you go...

419
00:25:56,092 --> 00:25:57,132
to the bathroom a few times today?

420
00:25:58,662 --> 00:25:59,732
Yes, I did.

421
00:26:00,962 --> 00:26:02,962
We need to fix this. Let's go fill you up again.

422
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:06,062
We're having an extra-large size of bossam for a snack!

423
00:26:11,732 --> 00:26:13,562
Bok Joo, you got to try harder.

424
00:26:13,962 --> 00:26:15,832
Woon Gi has already gained 1.6kg.

425
00:26:16,162 --> 00:26:18,932
No, I still have a long way to go. I have to increase my muscle mass.

426
00:26:19,262 --> 00:26:20,632
Bok Joo will get there soon, too.

427
00:26:21,432 --> 00:26:24,332
Bok Joo, eat the meat.

428
00:26:35,232 --> 00:26:37,562
Gosh, your cold is lasting for such a long time.

429
00:26:38,532 --> 00:26:40,732
Right, you're practically living in the pool to prepare for the match.

430
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:42,162
Of course the cold won't go away.

431
00:26:43,362 --> 00:26:44,362
You can't even take any medicine.

432
00:26:44,362 --> 00:26:46,192
By the way, why are you going on that match?

433
00:26:46,592 --> 00:26:48,792
Isn't that match for those who are starting out?

434
00:26:48,792 --> 00:26:49,862
You idiots.

435
00:26:50,162 --> 00:26:53,092
Only those who aren't competent are fussy about things like that.

436
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,692
Learn from us, you fools.

437
00:26:55,692 --> 00:26:57,992
When I was a freshman, I was not like you guys...

438
00:26:59,132 --> 00:27:00,662
Shut it and just eat your food.

439
00:27:10,492 --> 00:27:11,832
- You guys are done, right? 
- Yes.

440
00:27:11,832 --> 00:27:13,692
- We're going. 
- I'm not done yet.

441
00:27:14,262 --> 00:27:16,792
- I'm not done. I'm still eating. 
- Come on.

442
00:27:18,362 --> 00:27:19,462
Do you have a match coming up?

443
00:27:20,092 --> 00:27:21,892
It looks like you have a cold. Will you be okay?

444
00:27:22,232 --> 00:27:23,992
Coughing lasts for a long time when you catch a cold.

445
00:27:25,492 --> 00:27:27,162
You're really unbelievable.

446
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:29,632
You're acting like a stalker. Is this fun for you?

447
00:27:30,362 --> 00:27:31,462
How could it be fun?

448
00:27:32,292 --> 00:27:34,562
It's exhausting and embarrassing. My pride has been crushed.

449
00:27:35,092 --> 00:27:38,362
But I'm really desperate right now.

450
00:27:40,932 --> 00:27:42,232
You're the only thing I can hold onto.

451
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:44,962
That's just in your head.

452
00:27:45,462 --> 00:27:46,592
I'm not that person for you.

453
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,362
I'm just myself.

454
00:27:50,662 --> 00:27:51,692
Okay.

455
00:27:51,992 --> 00:27:53,362
I'll leave you alone, so finish your food.

456
00:27:54,362 --> 00:27:57,062
You can't even take medicine, so you have to eat well.

457
00:28:12,992 --> 00:28:15,362
It looks like Joon Hyung keeps rejecting you.

458
00:28:17,492 --> 00:28:18,762
Isn't it too demeaning?

459
00:28:19,462 --> 00:28:21,132
You're the most beautiful girl in our school.

460
00:28:21,962 --> 00:28:23,832
Is this why you kept rejecting me?

461
00:28:24,932 --> 00:28:26,062
You can come back.

462
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:28,792
I'll treat you better than Joon Hyung.

463
00:28:33,932 --> 00:28:35,032
Get lost, you jerk.

464
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:42,832
No, no.

465
00:28:42,832 --> 00:28:45,132
- I'll never finish this. No. 
- Let me go.

466
00:28:45,132 --> 00:28:46,892
No, no!

467
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:48,892
Why can't you eat it?

468
00:28:48,892 --> 00:28:50,262
Just have some drumsticks...

469
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:52,692
and drink the broth. It's not that much.

470
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:54,262
I thought you must be sick of fried chicken.

471
00:28:54,262 --> 00:28:57,892
That's why I boiled the chicken with ginseng and abalone.

472
00:28:58,032 --> 00:29:00,362
I even had three plates of food for lunch today.

473
00:29:00,592 --> 00:29:01,632
There's only so much I can eat.

474
00:29:01,632 --> 00:29:03,762
I can't just keep shoving food down my throat.

475
00:29:04,032 --> 00:29:05,662
My gosh.

476
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:07,332
Pick it up! Just wait.

477
00:29:08,562 --> 00:29:10,162
Bok Joo. I know it's hard,

478
00:29:10,162 --> 00:29:12,162
but you should try your best.

479
00:29:12,162 --> 00:29:14,362
I think you really have a shot at winning.

480
00:29:14,362 --> 00:29:15,862
I can feel it.

481
00:29:15,862 --> 00:29:18,492
That doesn't matter.

482
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,462
I'm saying I'm not confident!

483
00:29:20,462 --> 00:29:22,932
Gosh, just eat it. My arms are about to fall off.

484
00:29:23,032 --> 00:29:24,192
Then put it on your head!

485
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:25,462
Or on your back!

486
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:27,292
Be quiet, you punk.

487
00:29:27,292 --> 00:29:28,832
I can't put this on my back.

488
00:29:29,562 --> 00:29:30,792
Hello.

489
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:31,862
Hi, Coach Choi.

490
00:29:31,862 --> 00:29:34,492
You didn't have to go through the trouble and make this.

491
00:29:34,492 --> 00:29:36,462
I bought some pizza for Bok Joo as well.

492
00:29:36,462 --> 00:29:38,462
Is that so? Shall we go inside?

493
00:29:38,462 --> 00:29:40,492
- Let me carry it. 
- No, it's fine.

494
00:29:40,592 --> 00:29:42,062
Lifting things is what I do. Let's go.

495
00:29:42,562 --> 00:29:43,632
Let's eat, Bok Joo.

496
00:29:45,532 --> 00:29:46,662
- Let me carry it. 
- It's okay.

497
00:29:46,662 --> 00:29:48,762
- I can't eat any more. 
- Hurry up.

498
00:29:57,532 --> 00:29:59,192
Bok Joo's dad...

499
00:29:59,192 --> 00:30:01,262
makes such delicious food.

500
00:30:01,362 --> 00:30:02,732
He is a master.

501
00:30:02,732 --> 00:30:04,862
- This is perfectly seasoned. 
- I know.

502
00:30:04,962 --> 00:30:07,732
By the way, we can eat as much food as we want...

503
00:30:07,962 --> 00:30:09,262
with people's support.

504
00:30:09,492 --> 00:30:11,932
- Weightlifting isn't so bad, right? 
- That's right.

505
00:30:12,132 --> 00:30:15,362
Those gymnasts eat like a bird every day to lose weight.

506
00:30:16,262 --> 00:30:18,832
Eat up. Why are you picking at the food? This is all for you.

507
00:30:19,662 --> 00:30:21,692
She's right. Have some pizza.

508
00:30:22,192 --> 00:30:24,732
Should I pick some drumsticks? You like them.

509
00:30:24,732 --> 00:30:26,962
You said you wish chickens had four feet.

510
00:30:27,332 --> 00:30:28,832
I'm just sick of chicken.

511
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:32,162
I'll soon shed chicken broth instead of tears.

512
00:30:32,262 --> 00:30:33,462
I'm actually full.

513
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,162
We might all end up in the open-weight class.

514
00:30:36,262 --> 00:30:38,432
Don't be so weak.

515
00:30:38,492 --> 00:30:40,492
We, big eaters, always have...

516
00:30:40,492 --> 00:30:42,492
our friend, soft drinks.

517
00:30:42,662 --> 00:30:45,492
Help us, dear soft drinks!

518
00:30:45,492 --> 00:30:47,992
Gosh. I have some coins. I'll get them.

519
00:30:49,362 --> 00:30:50,432
Goodness.

520
00:30:51,692 --> 00:30:53,032
(A New Message)

521
00:30:54,862 --> 00:30:56,432
Hey. Don't try so hard.

522
00:30:56,532 --> 00:30:57,992
You'll lose weight. I'll do it.

523
00:30:57,992 --> 00:30:59,062
Let me.

524
00:31:01,792 --> 00:31:05,332
"Ms. Kim Bok Joo, your session is at 4:30pm tomorrow. J Weight Clinic."

525
00:31:05,332 --> 00:31:07,362
Your session is at 4:30 at J Weight...

526
00:31:11,092 --> 00:31:13,892
Hey. Why do you go to a weight clinic?

527
00:31:13,892 --> 00:31:15,292
Nan Hee. Let me explain.

528
00:31:15,292 --> 00:31:16,892
- Nan Hee. 
- I just...

529
00:31:19,932 --> 00:31:22,862
Hey! Why do you go to a weight clinic?

530
00:31:22,862 --> 00:31:24,262
You need to raise your weight class.

531
00:31:24,832 --> 00:31:26,992
What on earth are you up to these days?

532
00:31:28,562 --> 00:31:29,592
Nan Hee.

533
00:31:30,692 --> 00:31:31,832
How could that be?

534
00:31:39,762 --> 00:31:40,762
Great work today.

535
00:31:40,762 --> 00:31:42,862
- Are you saying you like him? 
- You, too. See you tomorrow.

536
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:44,362
Not Joon Hyung?

537
00:31:45,692 --> 00:31:46,692
Yes.

538
00:31:47,562 --> 00:31:51,462
And he is Joon Hyung's older brother.

539
00:31:52,862 --> 00:31:53,862
Yes.

540
00:31:54,892 --> 00:31:56,092
You wanted...

541
00:31:56,862 --> 00:31:58,732
to see him at any cost,

542
00:31:58,892 --> 00:32:01,192
so you signed up for sessions and paid a lot of money.

543
00:32:01,592 --> 00:32:03,262
You lied to us, kept going there,

544
00:32:03,492 --> 00:32:06,332
and lifted the rice bags for Joon Hyung to keep him quiet.

545
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,562
Is this what you're saying?

546
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:12,792
- Yes. 
- You crazy girl!

547
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:15,162
I know. I deserve that. I am crazy.

548
00:32:15,362 --> 00:32:16,992
No one in the right mind would do this.

549
00:32:16,992 --> 00:32:18,692
I tried hard not to do it,

550
00:32:18,992 --> 00:32:21,492
but he kept popping up in my head. I started seeing things.

551
00:32:22,032 --> 00:32:24,362
I really couldn't help it.

552
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:28,362
I just wanted to see his face. That's all I wanted.

553
00:32:29,262 --> 00:32:30,262
I get it.

554
00:32:32,062 --> 00:32:34,132
I mean he's way better than Joon Hyung.

555
00:32:34,362 --> 00:32:36,592
He's so manly. He looked very sturdy.

556
00:32:37,132 --> 00:32:38,492
Right? Isn't he handsome?

557
00:32:38,492 --> 00:32:39,962
Yes, he is.

558
00:32:40,162 --> 00:32:43,462
He's cute. Besides, he's a doctor.

559
00:32:44,932 --> 00:32:46,332
You're so sly.

560
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:48,692
You pretended that you were not interested in men at all.

561
00:32:49,062 --> 00:32:51,592
You have such a great taste in men.

562
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,762
By the way, how did you guys meet?

563
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,662
It wouldn't be like in the movie...

564
00:32:58,662 --> 00:33:02,562
where he shared his umbrella on a rainy day, right?

565
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:13,562
He did.

566
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:18,892
Oh, my. Really?

567
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:21,262
Did he really do that?

568
00:33:21,262 --> 00:33:22,362
My goodness.

569
00:33:22,362 --> 00:33:24,032
He makes my heart flatter.

570
00:33:24,032 --> 00:33:25,162
He's great and handsome, right?

571
00:33:25,162 --> 00:33:27,092
I want someone like him, too.

572
00:33:27,162 --> 00:33:30,492
- He's mine. 
- Is he? I'm so jealous.

573
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:38,762
(Si Ho, it's ginger extract. Eat it when you have a cold. Mom)

574
00:33:46,932 --> 00:33:49,662
Hey, what are you doing? Get some rest.

575
00:33:49,792 --> 00:33:51,892
You have a match tomorrow, and you're still sick.

576
00:33:52,192 --> 00:33:53,962
You should save your energy.

577
00:33:53,962 --> 00:33:55,232
I need to watch this.

578
00:33:55,362 --> 00:33:57,262
Watching it won't help you.

579
00:33:57,262 --> 00:33:58,462
Get rest.

580
00:33:58,462 --> 00:33:59,592
Sweet dreams.

581
00:34:00,192 --> 00:34:01,492
Fine. Gosh.

582
00:34:01,592 --> 00:34:03,232
Stop nagging me. You're not my mom.

583
00:34:03,692 --> 00:34:05,462
Stop complaining.

584
00:34:05,462 --> 00:34:06,462
Just go to sleep.

585
00:34:12,892 --> 00:34:13,962
It's me, Si Ho.

586
00:34:14,492 --> 00:34:16,992
Can you come out without telling Joon Hyung?

587
00:34:24,232 --> 00:34:25,262
I'm sorry.

588
00:34:25,462 --> 00:34:27,202
I called you out so suddenly. You must've been surprised.

589
00:34:28,462 --> 00:34:29,532
Here.

590
00:34:30,432 --> 00:34:33,032
What is this?

591
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,232
It's dates and ginger tea. Joon Hyung has a game tomorrow.

592
00:34:37,432 --> 00:34:38,862
If I give it to him, he won't drink it.

593
00:34:42,662 --> 00:34:43,662
Hey.

594
00:34:47,362 --> 00:34:48,362
What is it?

595
00:34:50,162 --> 00:34:52,202
It's my sincere love for you.

596
00:34:56,162 --> 00:34:57,362
Is this ginger tea?

597
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:00,792
Don't ask any questions and just drink up.

598
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,832
Think of it as medicine.

599
00:35:10,562 --> 00:35:11,592
It's good.

600
00:35:12,462 --> 00:35:13,492
I feel better now.

601
00:35:13,892 --> 00:35:15,632
Do you? That's good to hear.

602
00:35:16,592 --> 00:35:17,862
You punk.

603
00:35:17,862 --> 00:35:20,762
You shouldn't be so cold and play nice.

604
00:35:21,592 --> 00:35:23,962
What I meant was your body and heart are cold.

605
00:35:23,962 --> 00:35:27,202
That's why you caught a cold. That's what I wanted to say.

606
00:35:27,202 --> 00:35:29,592
Hey, I need to go to the bathroom. I have to go.

607
00:35:29,592 --> 00:35:32,632
I'll be in the bathroom. Finish it before I get back.

608
00:35:33,792 --> 00:35:34,862
What is he saying?

609
00:35:38,932 --> 00:35:41,232
Do you know how sexy his voice is?

610
00:35:41,662 --> 00:35:43,932
It's not too high or too low.

611
00:35:43,932 --> 00:35:45,462
It sounds so sweet.

612
00:35:46,432 --> 00:35:49,362
It must be as great as the prince's voice that Sleeping Beauty heard...

613
00:35:49,362 --> 00:35:51,862
when she woke up from her sleep.

614
00:35:53,492 --> 00:35:54,792
Gosh, really?

615
00:35:55,532 --> 00:35:57,792
I saw his face but didn't hear his voice.

616
00:35:58,232 --> 00:35:59,762
When he smiles,

617
00:35:59,762 --> 00:36:01,762
the corners of his eyes wrinkle a bit,

618
00:36:02,092 --> 00:36:03,892
and his white teeth are shown.

619
00:36:04,432 --> 00:36:05,562
It makes my heart flutter.

620
00:36:06,232 --> 00:36:08,462
It feels so enchanting. He melts my heart.

621
00:36:10,262 --> 00:36:12,592
Let me tell you the biggest reason why I fell for him.

622
00:36:12,592 --> 00:36:14,162
This is really important.

623
00:36:14,862 --> 00:36:16,092
It's...

624
00:36:17,292 --> 00:36:18,332
his gentle heart.

625
00:36:19,292 --> 00:36:21,992
I've never seen such a gentleman.

626
00:36:22,232 --> 00:36:25,232
He's not pretentious. It's his natural personality.

627
00:36:26,992 --> 00:36:28,362
When I'm with him,

628
00:36:28,832 --> 00:36:31,992
I feel like I became a very beautiful woman.

629
00:36:33,832 --> 00:36:36,792
I've never been treated like that, so I don't know how that feels.

630
00:36:38,492 --> 00:36:40,792
Anyway, he's fantastic.

631
00:36:41,362 --> 00:36:44,432
He's sweet, gentle, and reliable.

632
00:36:45,132 --> 00:36:47,492
I can't believe he is Joon Hyung's brother.

633
00:36:47,492 --> 00:36:49,492
He's so mature.

634
00:36:49,492 --> 00:36:52,962
Hey. Listening to you makes me want to meet him.

635
00:36:53,432 --> 00:36:54,432
Why?

636
00:36:55,532 --> 00:36:58,702
You're not going to make us fight over a guy, right?

637
00:36:58,702 --> 00:37:00,932
I'm a bit worried that you will.

638
00:37:01,092 --> 00:37:02,862
You flirt with every guy.

639
00:37:02,962 --> 00:37:05,892
No matter how desperate I am, I won't try to steal your man.

640
00:37:08,032 --> 00:37:09,092
My man?

641
00:37:09,832 --> 00:37:11,592
- Oh, my. 
- Bok Joo, gosh.

642
00:37:11,592 --> 00:37:12,592
Hey.

643
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:15,832
What are you doing here?

644
00:37:16,132 --> 00:37:17,432
We used the toilet, of course.

645
00:37:17,532 --> 00:37:18,962
We were about to leave. Let's go.

646
00:37:18,962 --> 00:37:20,032
Were you two...

647
00:37:23,292 --> 00:37:24,362
badmouthing me?

648
00:37:24,702 --> 00:37:27,332
How can you do that? You disappeared without me.

649
00:37:27,332 --> 00:37:28,832
Don't be absurd.

650
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:31,292
We don't have anything bad to say about you.

651
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:33,202
Of course. Don't be silly.

652
00:37:33,202 --> 00:37:34,702
Let's just go out.

653
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:41,762
Why did you take one Hamburg steak?

654
00:37:42,332 --> 00:37:45,132
You should eat a lot to put on weight. Here. Take mine.

655
00:37:46,992 --> 00:37:48,962
Thank you, Seon Ok.

656
00:37:54,362 --> 00:37:56,132
Seon Ok. Can you get me some water?

657
00:37:56,832 --> 00:37:58,662
The food got stuck in my throat.

658
00:38:09,992 --> 00:38:11,092
Here is water.

659
00:38:13,932 --> 00:38:15,092
Gosh, eat slowly.

660
00:38:16,332 --> 00:38:17,362
It finally went down.

661
00:38:18,932 --> 00:38:21,532
Wow, you're eating well today. Here you go.

662
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:23,662
Have another.

663
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:39,032
- Are you leaving now? 
- Yes, I have an appointment at 6pm.

664
00:38:40,992 --> 00:38:42,962
Is that what you're going to wear?

665
00:38:43,262 --> 00:38:45,892
- Are you serious? 
- Why? Do I look bad?

666
00:38:45,992 --> 00:38:47,032
Yes, you do.

667
00:38:49,032 --> 00:38:51,062
Is it at 6pm? Give me just 5 minutes.

668
00:39:11,702 --> 00:39:12,702
Okay.

669
00:39:13,492 --> 00:39:14,562
I did my best.

670
00:39:15,832 --> 00:39:16,832
Thank you.

671
00:39:17,462 --> 00:39:18,532
Let's go.

672
00:39:52,492 --> 00:39:53,592
Are you really going?

673
00:39:54,832 --> 00:39:55,862
Yes.

674
00:39:57,202 --> 00:39:58,562
Fine. Let me take a look at you.

675
00:40:00,032 --> 00:40:02,662
Since you're going, do a good job.

676
00:40:02,792 --> 00:40:04,892
Okay, go back inside.

677
00:40:08,562 --> 00:40:10,432
I should go with you because you're sick.

678
00:40:11,362 --> 00:40:12,962
It's unfortunate that I have training.

679
00:40:13,362 --> 00:40:15,632
You should work harder.

680
00:40:15,632 --> 00:40:17,262
You don't swim as well as I do.

681
00:40:17,932 --> 00:40:19,132
You're so cruel.

682
00:40:19,762 --> 00:40:21,032
Fine, you punk.

683
00:40:21,032 --> 00:40:23,432
I get what you mean. Just go.

684
00:40:23,702 --> 00:40:25,862
You'd better win first place, okay?

685
00:40:26,362 --> 00:40:28,462
Did I make you upset? You're so cute.

686
00:40:29,032 --> 00:40:30,062
See you.

687
00:40:33,962 --> 00:40:35,132
Good luck.

688
00:40:36,532 --> 00:40:37,962
Focus on the start.

689
00:40:39,762 --> 00:40:41,262
It's grilled abalone this time?

690
00:40:41,332 --> 00:40:43,232
We had abalone chicken soup last time.

691
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:46,132
That was regular abalone I bought at the market.

692
00:40:46,562 --> 00:40:48,262
The abalone is from Wando this time.

693
00:40:48,262 --> 00:40:49,292
Just for you,

694
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:52,232
I called my friend whom I haven't talked to in 10 years.

695
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,062
Please try to come to the restaurant later.

696
00:40:56,232 --> 00:40:57,792
Don't bring your friends today.

697
00:40:58,632 --> 00:41:00,532
There isn't enough.

698
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,932
I could only get 30 abalone.

699
00:41:02,932 --> 00:41:04,932
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

700
00:41:13,362 --> 00:41:14,362
Where are you going?

701
00:41:15,132 --> 00:41:17,632
- Are you going to the clinic? 
- Why do you even ask?

702
00:41:19,092 --> 00:41:22,202
I'm on my way to a competition, so send me some good energy.

703
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:25,262
You know you will be fine.

704
00:41:25,962 --> 00:41:28,332
I don't wish you luck. I hope you make a mistake.

705
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:33,202
Gosh, she's so mean.

706
00:41:33,562 --> 00:41:36,062
I'm so nervous, but she tries to put a curse on me instead.

707
00:41:36,562 --> 00:41:37,632
You wait and see.

708
00:41:42,062 --> 00:41:44,092
Hey, I'm going to get you!

709
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:45,892
What a jerk.

(J Weight Clinic)

711
00:41:51,792 --> 00:41:53,332
Your weight increased again.

712
00:41:59,492 --> 00:42:01,132
Why can't you look at me in the eyes?

713
00:42:03,332 --> 00:42:06,362
I'm sorry for keep disappointing you, Dr. Jeong.

714
00:42:06,362 --> 00:42:08,162
You don't need to apologize to me.

715
00:42:08,162 --> 00:42:09,892
This is all for your sake.

716
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:13,532
It isn't easy to follow the diet plan, is it?

717
00:42:13,862 --> 00:42:15,362
People around you probably don't help, either.

718
00:42:17,092 --> 00:42:19,992
- Right. 
- The evening is the most difficult.

719
00:42:20,092 --> 00:42:22,532
Unfortunately, socializing in Korea takes place in the late evening.

720
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:25,632
Some patients say they want to move to a deserted island.

721
00:42:26,132 --> 00:42:29,092
I know. I can't stop my contact with friends.

722
00:42:29,962 --> 00:42:32,362
Let's try harder to lose your weight.

723
00:42:32,362 --> 00:42:33,832
Please get changed for the treatment.

724
00:42:35,132 --> 00:42:36,162
Okay.

725
00:42:37,462 --> 00:42:39,462
Joon Hyung has a competition today.

726
00:42:40,362 --> 00:42:42,632
I sent him a message to wish him luck.

727
00:42:43,432 --> 00:42:45,232
He hasn't replied. He must be busy.

728
00:42:45,662 --> 00:42:47,762
He'll do well. He's confident after all.

729
00:42:48,162 --> 00:42:50,462
He may look it, but he's quite tender-hearted.

730
00:42:51,562 --> 00:42:53,332
It's an important competition for him.

731
00:42:55,262 --> 00:42:58,662
Two years ago, he made a mistake at the start and was disqualified.

732
00:42:59,762 --> 00:43:01,992
His records from training are good enough for the national team.

733
00:43:02,832 --> 00:43:05,492
Ever since, he's made mistakes at the start in important competitions.

734
00:43:06,762 --> 00:43:09,062
I think Joon Hyung is traumatized by the first mistake he made.

735
00:43:11,662 --> 00:43:14,702
Goodness, he always pretends to be strong.

736
00:43:16,062 --> 00:43:17,562
I had no idea.

737
00:43:17,562 --> 00:43:19,932
I gave him a cold and wished him bad luck.

738
00:43:21,962 --> 00:43:23,792
I'm so careless about what I say.

739
00:43:34,262 --> 00:43:37,832
If Joon Hyung doesn't do well, he'll only blame me.

740
00:43:37,832 --> 00:43:38,932
I hope he'll do well.

741
00:43:39,462 --> 00:43:41,492
Also, was it his trauma?

742
00:43:41,492 --> 00:43:44,992
I hope he overcomes it so that he can do his best.

743
00:43:45,262 --> 00:43:47,692
Please.

744
00:43:49,462 --> 00:43:57,332
(Good luck! You can do it, Jeong Joon Hyung!)

(Joongang Bank Swim Competition)

746
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:12,462
When you have the symptom,

747
00:44:12,462 --> 00:44:14,592
not focusing on the symptom...

748
00:44:14,992 --> 00:44:17,262
is most effective when overcoming it.

749
00:44:18,332 --> 00:44:19,932
When you start to feel nervous,

750
00:44:19,932 --> 00:44:21,992
try to think of something else.

751
00:44:22,532 --> 00:44:24,832
For example, focus on your breathing.

752
00:44:25,092 --> 00:44:27,762
It's also effective to count down the numbers.

753
00:44:30,732 --> 00:44:31,732
Ten.

754
00:44:32,862 --> 00:44:33,932
Nine.

755
00:44:34,892 --> 00:44:35,892
Eight.

756
00:44:37,162 --> 00:44:38,162
Seven.

757
00:44:39,162 --> 00:44:40,232
Six.

758
00:44:41,132 --> 00:44:42,132
Five.

759
00:44:45,732 --> 00:44:46,762
Four.

One.

763
00:45:17,032 --> 00:45:18,432
Please, Joon Hyung.

764
00:45:44,662 --> 00:45:45,692
Take your mark.

765
00:45:52,032 --> 00:45:54,692
Five, four, three,

766
00:45:55,692 --> 00:45:56,692
two.

767
00:46:32,432 --> 00:46:34,532
First place goes to Lee Sang Young from Dongha University.

768
00:46:35,162 --> 00:46:37,232
Second place goes to Choi Jae Hyung from Minju City Hall.

769
00:46:37,992 --> 00:46:40,262
Third place goes to Park Jun from Kyungjin Sport University.

770
00:46:40,962 --> 00:46:43,162
Fourth place goes to Jeong Joon Hyung.

(Results of Joongang Bank Swim Competition)

772
00:47:18,162 --> 00:47:20,732
He didn't make it to the top three.

773
00:47:22,092 --> 00:47:24,462
Why didn't he do better?

774
00:47:24,462 --> 00:47:27,162
Did he get disqualified again? That jerk.

775
00:47:31,132 --> 00:47:34,032
Joon Hyung, are you okay? Stay strong.

776
00:47:34,032 --> 00:47:37,262
(Joon Hyung, are you okay? Stay strong...)

777
00:47:40,092 --> 00:47:42,432
Joon Hyung, it serves you right.

778
00:47:46,362 --> 00:47:49,032
Gosh, what should I write him? I can't send him a sweet message.

779
00:48:06,662 --> 00:48:08,092
Drink it up without leaving a drop.

780
00:48:09,092 --> 00:48:10,162
Go on.

781
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:19,262
Finish it.

782
00:48:20,062 --> 00:48:21,062
Good.

783
00:48:21,262 --> 00:48:23,362
Gosh. If I didn't catch a cold,

784
00:48:23,362 --> 00:48:25,492
I totally would've been able to win the first place.

785
00:48:25,592 --> 00:48:27,192
Why am I so unlucky?

786
00:48:27,332 --> 00:48:30,162
You should've visited us before the match.

787
00:48:30,432 --> 00:48:33,192
Your mom made for you with special ingredients which would...

788
00:48:33,432 --> 00:48:34,462
be fine for the doping test.

789
00:48:35,092 --> 00:48:36,132
I should have.

790
00:48:36,362 --> 00:48:38,762
I must be getting punished for looking down on the match.

791
00:48:38,762 --> 00:48:40,562
Gosh, stop it. It's completely fine.

792
00:48:40,892 --> 00:48:42,362
You said it's not an important match.

793
00:48:42,732 --> 00:48:44,362
Just forget about it.

794
00:48:45,292 --> 00:48:47,492
- Did you talk to Jae Yi? 
- Yes, I did.

795
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:50,732
His nagging is driving me crazy.

796
00:48:50,932 --> 00:48:53,732
He's acting just like you. All he does is worry about me.

797
00:48:57,362 --> 00:48:58,362
Where are you?

798
00:48:58,732 --> 00:49:00,362
- It's Chubs. 
- Chubs?

799
00:49:00,732 --> 00:49:01,992
Who is Chubs?

800
00:49:02,562 --> 00:49:05,362
A friend of mine who is really funny.

801
00:49:07,192 --> 00:49:09,632
Chubs sounds like a name for a dog.

802
00:49:10,562 --> 00:49:12,632
What's up, Chubs? You never text me.

803
00:49:16,462 --> 00:49:21,632
(What's up, Chubs? You never text me.)

804
00:49:21,632 --> 00:49:22,632
I asked you where you are.

805
00:49:24,362 --> 00:49:25,432
I'm at home.

806
00:49:25,732 --> 00:49:26,832
I'll head back to school now.

807
00:49:30,132 --> 00:49:31,232
He'll be back soon, then.

808
00:49:38,132 --> 00:49:41,332
What's going on with this girl? She asked me to come to the fountain.

809
00:49:44,162 --> 00:49:45,592
Quack, quack.

810
00:49:45,762 --> 00:49:47,262
Quack, quack, quack.

811
00:49:47,562 --> 00:49:49,192
Quack, quack, quack...

812
00:49:49,192 --> 00:49:50,192
What's going on, Bok Joo?

813
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,662
- What's that? 
- Here. It's a toad.

814
00:50:01,592 --> 00:50:04,032
I didn't make it because you talked about it.

815
00:50:04,192 --> 00:50:06,992
I was bored, and I happened to have a few pieces of paper lying around.

816
00:50:08,832 --> 00:50:11,192
Who knows? It may be your lucky charm.

817
00:50:14,192 --> 00:50:16,232
You're obviously so not crafty.

818
00:50:16,462 --> 00:50:17,862
Look at how it's all wrinkled up.

819
00:50:18,962 --> 00:50:20,492
How many times did you undo and redo this?

820
00:50:20,692 --> 00:50:22,062
Hey, give it back then!

821
00:50:23,692 --> 00:50:24,792
You can't take it back.

822
00:50:25,362 --> 00:50:28,092
It's mine now. We'll see whether it'll bring me luck or not.

823
00:50:28,662 --> 00:50:29,732
Awesome toad.

824
00:50:30,462 --> 00:50:31,992
- You copycat. 
- What's wrong with it?

825
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,332
You and your friends say it all the time.

826
00:50:34,462 --> 00:50:35,462
"Awesome."

827
00:50:38,092 --> 00:50:39,432
It sounds different when I say it, right?

828
00:50:40,092 --> 00:50:43,192
It probably sounds way cooler.

829
00:50:43,662 --> 00:50:45,462
What? You're cracking a joke,

830
00:50:45,462 --> 00:50:47,362
so you must feel better now. Is your cold gone?

831
00:50:47,792 --> 00:50:48,832
It's better.

832
00:50:49,232 --> 00:50:51,262
I'm sure it'll go away soon. I took medicine when I was at home.

833
00:50:54,962 --> 00:50:56,692
I'm sorry for being harsh on you earlier.

834
00:50:57,592 --> 00:50:59,232
I'm on edge these days.

835
00:51:02,462 --> 00:51:04,992
Hey. You should've done a better job, though.

836
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:06,992
I know.

837
00:51:07,432 --> 00:51:09,192
I guess I was too full of myself.

838
00:51:10,032 --> 00:51:13,292
Don't worry, though. I'm going to surprise everyone very soon.

839
00:51:14,132 --> 00:51:16,992
You better not ask me for 100 autographs when that happens.

840
00:51:17,162 --> 00:51:20,462
I'll be at the Olympics by then.

841
00:51:20,692 --> 00:51:21,762
You wish.

842
00:51:24,492 --> 00:51:25,562
Let's go.

843
00:51:25,662 --> 00:51:28,792
We have time until the roll call. I'll treat you to something good.

844
00:51:29,332 --> 00:51:30,362
Seriously?

845
00:51:31,032 --> 00:51:34,492
- What are you treating me to? 
- Something that will energize you.

846
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:36,462
Keep your mouth shut and just follow me.

847
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:39,962
Why are you heading towards school?

848
00:51:51,492 --> 00:51:52,892
Gosh, just a moment.

849
00:51:52,992 --> 00:51:54,432
- Do you want to get on this? 
- Yes!

850
00:51:54,592 --> 00:51:56,362
- I want to... 
- Gosh! No, you can't.

851
00:51:56,362 --> 00:51:57,562
Giving you a ride the other day...

852
00:51:57,562 --> 00:51:59,732
made be bedridden for three days because of a backache.

853
00:51:59,732 --> 00:52:01,692
- No way. 
- Shall I teach you a lesson?

854
00:52:03,992 --> 00:52:05,032
Gosh, I said no.

855
00:52:05,332 --> 00:52:06,832
Goodness. I won't go, then.

856
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:10,562
Joon Hyung, come on. Let's go!

857
00:52:11,562 --> 00:52:13,692
I'm treating you, for goodness' sake.

858
00:52:13,692 --> 00:52:15,362
You can't even do this for me?

859
00:52:15,762 --> 00:52:17,662
Joon Hyung, get on your bike. Hey!

860
00:52:18,162 --> 00:52:20,762
- The number you're calling... 
- Jeong Joon Hyung!

861
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:23,232
- Please leave a message after... 
- You're seriously a piece of work.

862
00:52:23,462 --> 00:52:25,192
You said you want to ride it.

863
00:52:25,692 --> 00:52:27,092
Hey! I'm going to throw this out.

864
00:52:30,492 --> 00:52:31,992
Gosh, seriously.

865
00:52:42,362 --> 00:52:44,562
- Who is he? 
- Say hello. This is my dad.

866
00:52:45,062 --> 00:52:46,092
Hello.

867
00:52:46,592 --> 00:52:49,462
- This is... 
- Oh! The one with the tab.

868
00:52:49,962 --> 00:52:50,992
Yes, that's right.

869
00:52:51,362 --> 00:52:53,632
- Do you know him, Dad? 
- The other day...

870
00:52:53,632 --> 00:52:55,062
I've been here once before with friends.

871
00:52:55,332 --> 00:52:56,362
I didn't know it was your dad's.

872
00:52:57,062 --> 00:52:58,892
What's your relationship, exactly?

873
00:52:59,292 --> 00:53:01,532
Bok Joo has never brought a boy here before.

874
00:53:01,532 --> 00:53:03,192
This is very interesting.

875
00:53:03,632 --> 00:53:05,632
We went to the same elementary school. He's in the swimming team.

876
00:53:11,932 --> 00:53:13,862
I owe him a lot, so I want to do something for him.

877
00:53:13,862 --> 00:53:14,962
We have a lot of abalone, right?

878
00:53:15,932 --> 00:53:17,162
- What? 
- Abalone.

879
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:19,462
What do you mean?

880
00:53:19,862 --> 00:53:20,862
Wild abalone.

881
00:53:25,492 --> 00:53:27,192
You said we have wild abalone from Wando.

882
00:53:29,232 --> 00:53:30,232
We have a lot of it, right?

883
00:53:35,592 --> 00:53:38,062
I didn't know that you and Bok Joo went to the same elementary school.

884
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:40,962
- Eat up. 
- Thank you.

885
00:53:41,492 --> 00:53:43,832
- This abalone is very rare. 
- I see.

886
00:53:47,492 --> 00:53:48,562
Hey, eat up.

887
00:53:52,332 --> 00:53:54,292
No, you eat. I don't have much appetite.

888
00:53:55,492 --> 00:53:56,792
Just eat!

889
00:53:56,932 --> 00:53:59,092
I can't stand the feeling of being indebted.

890
00:53:59,092 --> 00:54:01,062
Eat up so that you can fight off your cold.

891
00:54:06,332 --> 00:54:07,832
- Dad. 
- Yes?

892
00:54:08,762 --> 00:54:11,792
Oh, sorry. Make yourself at home. I hope you enjoy it.

893
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:22,992
Is it good?

894
00:54:34,362 --> 00:54:35,692
My goodness.

895
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:40,032
- Gosh, I can't believe that I'm... 
- Eat up.

896
00:54:40,032 --> 00:54:43,032
seeing Bok Joo with a boy right now. Doesn't it feel weird, Chang Geol?

897
00:54:43,032 --> 00:54:46,032
Goodness, getting those wild abalone was so hard.

898
00:54:46,362 --> 00:54:48,262
I can't believe that weasel is eating all of them.

899
00:54:48,532 --> 00:54:50,032
Why are you calling him a weasel?

900
00:54:50,032 --> 00:54:52,832
I must say that he's very handsome.

901
00:54:53,932 --> 00:54:56,992
To be honest, Bok Joo isn't good enough for him...

902
00:54:56,992 --> 00:54:58,492
- in terms of looks. 
- Just eat.

903
00:54:58,492 --> 00:55:00,262
See? She likes him more.

904
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:03,132
Are you blind or what?

905
00:55:03,662 --> 00:55:04,732
What's wrong with Bok Joo?

906
00:55:04,832 --> 00:55:05,962
My vision is perfectly fine.

907
00:55:05,962 --> 00:55:07,632
It's 1.0 on both eyes.

908
00:55:07,632 --> 00:55:09,692
- It can't get any better. 
- Shut it, you fool.

909
00:55:11,832 --> 00:55:13,592
Anyway, I don't like that guy.

910
00:55:14,962 --> 00:55:16,292
I saw him...

911
00:55:16,462 --> 00:55:19,232
giving Bok Joo naughty looks.

912
00:55:19,262 --> 00:55:20,292
Who?

913
00:55:20,792 --> 00:55:21,792
That guy?

914
00:55:22,262 --> 00:55:24,462
In my opinion, he's in more danger.

915
00:55:24,562 --> 00:55:26,862
At a glance, I can tell that Bok Joo likes him more.

916
00:55:26,862 --> 00:55:28,992
What are you talking about? She said they're just friends.

917
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,862
Then why is she giving him all the abalone?

918
00:55:31,262 --> 00:55:34,062
I mean, she's not the type to share food with other people.

919
00:55:34,862 --> 00:55:37,862
It shows that she's head over heels for him.

920
00:55:42,292 --> 00:55:44,062
Hey, where are we going?

921
00:55:44,232 --> 00:55:46,432
Gosh, just follow me.

922
00:55:52,332 --> 00:55:53,632
- It's so beautiful. 
- Oh, my.

923
00:55:54,462 --> 00:55:55,492
Isn't my neighborhood so beautiful?

924
00:55:55,732 --> 00:55:57,432
It's so pretty up here at night.

925
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:58,562
Everything sparkles.

926
00:55:59,362 --> 00:56:00,362
Yes.

927
00:56:03,762 --> 00:56:04,792
It's pretty.

928
00:56:05,692 --> 00:56:08,862
By the way, your trauma.

929
00:56:09,462 --> 00:56:10,462
What is it caused by?

930
00:56:11,492 --> 00:56:12,532
What?

931
00:56:13,532 --> 00:56:14,992
I heard from Doctor Jeong.

932
00:56:15,662 --> 00:56:17,832
Is it caused by pre-match anxiety?

933
00:56:21,662 --> 00:56:22,692
I'm not sure.

934
00:56:24,332 --> 00:56:25,792
How did you get into swimming?

935
00:56:26,162 --> 00:56:27,262
Did your parents tell you to do it?

936
00:56:27,762 --> 00:56:29,662
No. I just liked water.

937
00:56:31,962 --> 00:56:35,092
I first learned swimming when I followed Jae Yi to a pool as a kid.

938
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:37,332
Water comforted me so much.

939
00:56:37,832 --> 00:56:39,992
It felt warm...

940
00:56:39,992 --> 00:56:41,532
as if it was embracing me.

941
00:56:42,862 --> 00:56:44,932
You have quite the sensibilities.

942
00:56:45,592 --> 00:56:47,332
Did your personality change after you started swimming?

943
00:56:48,362 --> 00:56:49,432
Maybe.

944
00:56:50,162 --> 00:56:51,162
I think so.

945
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:53,862
It did. You're right.

946
00:56:55,362 --> 00:56:56,832
That's how I got into swimming,

947
00:56:57,032 --> 00:57:00,262
but now that I'm majoring in it, it has become quite stressful.

948
00:57:00,562 --> 00:57:02,492
I can't help but obsess over my records.

949
00:57:02,662 --> 00:57:04,762
I feel like a bull going on a bullfight.

950
00:57:04,932 --> 00:57:05,962
I know.

951
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:08,462
"Don't worry about your ranking..."

952
00:57:08,462 --> 00:57:11,732
"and just lift weights." I'd have so much fun if that was the case.

953
00:57:13,162 --> 00:57:15,162
Gosh, I hate that I have to be ranked!

954
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:17,832
Gosh, I hate that I have to be ranked!

955
00:57:19,032 --> 00:57:20,032
But you know what?

956
00:57:20,432 --> 00:57:22,932
In a way, it's our fate as athletes.

957
00:57:23,992 --> 00:57:25,062
We have to accept it.

958
00:57:30,362 --> 00:57:31,362
Hey.

959
00:57:31,862 --> 00:57:32,962
Cheer up.

960
00:57:33,362 --> 00:57:35,292
I'm a good judge of character,

961
00:57:35,632 --> 00:57:37,262
and I know that you'll achieve your goal.

962
00:57:37,962 --> 00:57:40,692
I see something very intense in your eyes.

963
00:57:44,192 --> 00:57:45,562
Are you falling into my eyes?

964
00:57:46,332 --> 00:57:48,462
Yes, I totally am.

965
00:58:02,962 --> 00:58:04,732
It's so beautiful!

966
00:58:05,662 --> 00:58:07,362
We can't even come here when it's colder.

967
00:58:10,562 --> 00:58:13,332
Gosh, Bok Joo must be so full by now.

968
00:58:13,592 --> 00:58:14,632
I know.

969
00:58:14,962 --> 00:58:17,362
Her dad called her, so he'd be feeding her chicken soup.

970
00:58:17,362 --> 00:58:19,262
I've been watching Bok Joo and I realized...

971
00:58:19,692 --> 00:58:22,462
- gaining weight is hard. 
- Of course.

972
00:58:22,662 --> 00:58:24,732
Raising weight class is much harder.

973
00:58:24,732 --> 00:58:27,362
Bok Joo is working so hard to put on weight.

974
00:59:04,132 --> 00:59:05,862
(Name: Kim Bok Joo Current weight: 57.39kg)

975
00:59:16,432 --> 00:59:17,932
Right now, I feel like...

976
00:59:17,932 --> 00:59:20,632
I won't get sick for one whole year.

977
00:59:21,662 --> 00:59:23,892
This is why people are so eager...

978
00:59:23,892 --> 00:59:25,932
to eat wild abalone.

979
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:27,892
- Did it give you some energy? 
- Yes.

980
00:59:27,892 --> 00:59:29,592
I can feel energy surging up.

981
00:59:30,092 --> 00:59:32,932
Your dad's food is what made you so strong.

982
00:59:33,432 --> 00:59:35,432
Now that we ate it together, let's work hard.

983
00:59:35,832 --> 00:59:37,832
It's not like athletes...

984
00:59:37,832 --> 00:59:39,662
get better overnight.

985
00:59:40,232 --> 00:59:43,362
You should have a good physical strength to win the war of nerves.

986
00:59:43,462 --> 00:59:45,532
How long are you going to live a double life?

987
00:59:47,362 --> 00:59:48,462
I know.

988
00:59:49,062 --> 00:59:51,162
I should put an end to it soon.

989
00:59:58,932 --> 00:59:59,932
Look, there's a toad!

990
01:00:01,162 --> 01:00:03,892
- Do you want me to punch you? 
- I'm serious.

991
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:05,892
There was a toad this big.

992
01:00:05,892 --> 01:00:07,432
Hey! There it is!

993
01:00:07,432 --> 01:00:10,362
Cut it out. You just like to tease me.

994
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:14,262
You'd better watch out if you want to live. Okay?

995
01:00:16,732 --> 01:00:18,562
Gosh, why won't you believe me?

996
01:00:19,162 --> 01:00:21,292
There was a toad this big.

997
01:00:22,792 --> 01:00:23,862
Awesome.

998
01:00:25,192 --> 01:00:26,892
What was that? That's not how you say it.

999
01:00:27,462 --> 01:00:29,262
- Awesome. 
- Awesome.

1000
01:00:29,262 --> 01:00:30,432
This is how you say it. Try again.

1001
01:00:32,292 --> 01:00:34,192
Stop laughing and do it again.

1002
01:00:38,532 --> 01:00:40,462
You're here. You must be tired.

1003
01:00:40,462 --> 01:00:43,032
I cleaned your desk and bed.

1004
01:00:43,232 --> 01:00:44,762
Okay. Thank you.

1005
01:00:47,092 --> 01:00:48,092
Joon Hyung.

1006
01:00:48,832 --> 01:00:49,832
You're okay, right?

1007
01:00:50,192 --> 01:00:53,032
It wasn't a major competition. You'll do better next time.

1008
01:00:53,832 --> 01:00:55,862
I didn't say anything. I'm fine.

1009
01:00:56,232 --> 01:00:58,192
I wasn't disqualified today.

1010
01:00:58,962 --> 01:01:01,532
That's right. I knew you were broad-minded.

1011
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:11,762
She's surprisingly cute.

1012
01:01:33,092 --> 01:01:35,232
(Weightlifting Team)

1013
01:01:43,362 --> 01:01:46,832
You should stick more meatballs into the chopstick. Two aren't enough.

1014
01:01:46,932 --> 01:01:49,032
Bok Joo, do you want more? I got many of them.

1015
01:01:49,032 --> 01:01:51,462
No, just leave them there. I'll eat them later. Thank you.

1016
01:01:51,462 --> 01:01:52,492
Okay.

1017
01:01:53,032 --> 01:01:55,232
Hey. Why isn't Coach Choi here today?

1018
01:01:55,592 --> 01:01:58,162
She'd stand next to Bok Joo during breakfast and lunch,

1019
01:01:58,162 --> 01:01:59,462
and shout, "Have one more plate!"

1020
01:01:59,862 --> 01:02:01,862
Maybe she's just sleeping in.

1021
01:02:01,862 --> 01:02:03,132
Hurry. We'll be late for class.

1022
01:02:03,162 --> 01:02:04,832
(Dad)

1023
01:02:08,692 --> 01:02:11,432
What is it, Dad? Did you make beef bone soup this time?

1024
01:02:11,662 --> 01:02:13,362
Be quiet and come home right now.

1025
01:02:17,932 --> 01:02:19,592
What is it, Dad? It's early.

1026
01:02:21,762 --> 01:02:23,632
What brings both of you here?

1027
01:02:29,992 --> 01:02:31,032
What is this?

1028
01:02:34,962 --> 01:02:36,362
Tell me what it is, you brat!

1029
01:02:47,262 --> 01:02:48,262
(Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo)

1030
01:02:48,262 --> 01:02:49,632
Get over here!

1031
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:52,592
You went to a weight clinic. Do you now see food as poison now?

1032
01:02:52,592 --> 01:02:54,532
Can't you see me, Bok Joo?

1033
01:02:54,532 --> 01:02:55,962
Is Bok Joo home?

1034
01:02:55,962 --> 01:02:57,692
There you are, Bok Joo!

1035
01:02:57,692 --> 01:02:59,892
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo!

1036
01:02:59,892 --> 01:03:01,292
I had fun today, thanks to you.

1037
01:03:01,292 --> 01:03:03,692
Weightlifters can date, too.

1038
01:03:03,692 --> 01:03:04,762
Coach.

1039
01:03:04,762 --> 01:03:06,832
This is my second gift. Today is Jae Yi's birthday.

1040
01:03:06,832 --> 01:03:09,562
I'm Kim Bok Joo, a sophomore at Haneol Sport University.

1041
01:03:09,562 --> 01:03:11,692
I like you, Dr. Jeong.
