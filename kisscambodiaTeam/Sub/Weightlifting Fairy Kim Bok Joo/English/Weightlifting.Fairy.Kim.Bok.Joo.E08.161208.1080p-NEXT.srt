00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,920
Hi, Joon Hyung. It's me.

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,720
What should I tell Dr. Jeong?

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,490
Hey. What are you up to?

5
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,720
Why do you keep calling Joon Hyung and seeing him?

6
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,420
I heard you like someone else.

7
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,860
Why are you making passes at Joon Hyung?

8
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,020
Making passes? What are you talking about?

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,690
I left your diet journal...

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,690
at the gym.

11
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,690
  What?

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,390
What... What did you say?

13
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:45,860
Are you saying that...

14
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,820
you put my diet journal there on purpose?

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,620
Yes, I'm the one who did it.

16
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,960
Why?

17
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,190
Why would you do that?

18
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,090
I was annoyed and upset that you were so close to Joon Hyung.

19
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,260
What?

20
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,320
- I can't believe this. - That's right.

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,920
I told you that I want to get back together with him.

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,690
Didn't you know that it was a warning?

23
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,620
Whenever I want to be with him, you're always with him.

24
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,320
You said you like someone else.

25
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,290
Are you dating around?

26
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,690
Hey, listen.

27
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,960
I don't date around.

28
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,790
I have no intention to date Joon Hyung at all!

29
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,960
Besides, he doesn't find me attractive.

30
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,220
Why would he like me when he's so popular?

31
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,360
Then...

32
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,390
- was it my misunderstanding? - Yes, it was.

33
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,420
Shouldn't you apologize to me before bringing that up?

34
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,420
No, I don't want to apologize.

35
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,890
Joon Hyung hurt my feelings because of you.

36
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,260
It was because of you, not me.

37
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,890
Gosh, you're so aggressive.

38
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,160
Now I know why...

39
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,860
Joon Hyung dislikes you and doesn't want you back.

40
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,020
You're two-faced.

41
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,490
What do you know?

42
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,120
You don't know anything about my relationship with him.

43
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,690
You're right. I don't know.

44
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:00,720
I'm not interested, either.

45
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,590
Let me go. I don't want to talk to you

46
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,160
I'll sleep somewhere else.

47
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,520
It was serious between us.

48
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,390
That's why Joon Hyung was hurt.

49
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,060
Whatever, just let me go!

50
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,690
Hey, hey.

51
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,860
Let go of me now!

52
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,860
How dare you trivialize our relationship?

53
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,960
How dare you?

54
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,220
I'm the one who should be angry. Let me go!

55
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,820
My goodness.

56
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,090
Seon Ok, are you going to stay upset?

57
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,790
Like I said, I wasn't trying to bully you.

58
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,490
I found out only a few days ago.

59
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,060
Let me sleep here tonight.

60
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,990
What brings you here?

61
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,220
Why don't you sleep in your own room?

62
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,120
I can't think clearly right now.

63
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,690
When a room becomes available, I'll ask the housemistress...

64
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,590
for a change. Until then, let me stay here.

65
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,760
Goodness, did you fight with Si Ho?

66
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,720
Did you punch her?

67
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,460
Why would I?

68
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,320
She was the one who attacked me.

69
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,760
Seon Ok, can't you even say hi to me?

70
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,160
Are you still upset?

71
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,620
Fine, blame everything on me.

72
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,920
Please don't be upset.

73
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,390
Why did you argue with Si Ho?

74
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,460
Tell me.

75
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,020
I don't want to talk about it. What a mess.

76
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,620
(Chubs)

77
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,190
It's because of me.

78
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,520
(Episode 8, The Wind is Blowing)

79
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,790
Does that mean it was all because of Si Ho?

80
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,990
That's what I'm saying.

81
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,890
Seriously,

82
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,230
she's good at making people dislike her.

83
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,690
She wasn't even sorry when she told me about it.

84
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,420
Gosh, she's so horrible.

85
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,690
I'd better go and give a piece of my mind...

86
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,960
I've done enough. Stay in bed.

87
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,360
I thought she was different from other gymnasts,

88
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,760
but she was only being fake.

89
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,020
I knew she couldn't get along with us. She's a gymnast, after all.

90
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,490
What did I tell you?

91
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,460
I told you that there was something uneasy about her.

92
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,420
What?

93
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,160
Bok Joo, I'm really sorry.

94
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,730
I'm terribly sorry.

95
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,560
I'll buy you meat. It's your favorite.

96
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,590
This isn't right.

97
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,860
Let's say that she's here.

98
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,790
Hey, I'm sorry.

99
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,160
I'll buy you meat.

100
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,390
This isn't right, either.

101
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,160
Hey.

102
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,190
Why did you call me at this hour?

103
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,020
What if the housemistress catches us?

104
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,960
It's because...

105
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,920
the call got disconnected suddenly.

106
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,560
Is something wrong?

107
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,760
Joon Hyung.

108
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,490
Can you please leave me alone?

109
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,390
I don't want to cause any misunderstanding, okay?

110
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,090
Did...

111
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,260
Si Ho tell you?

112
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,560
She did, didn't she?

113
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,520
Speaking of which,

114
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,320
I don't dare to talk to you now. She's way too scary.

115
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,220
I'm really sorry about what happened.

116
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,320
You should be sorry.

117
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,360
It's all because of you.

118
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,320
Ever since I argued with Si Ho,

119
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,920
I've been so angry and stressed out.

120
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,760
I'm sorry, Chubs.

121
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,060
Forget it.

122
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:07,690
Gosh.

123
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,160
Why does she even like you?

124
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,060
I'm charming in so many ways.

125
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,390
You're making me angrier.

126
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,390
Hey!

127
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,020
No one's here.

128
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
Did she leave?

129
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,490
I think so.

130
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,060
If we get caught like this, people will misunderstand us.

131
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,160
Your ex-girlfriend might beat you up.

132
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,560
Be more careful.

133
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,020
Are you scared of her?

134
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,590
Why would I be scared of that skinny girl?

135
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,160
I'm Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo.

136
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,460
- This is great. - What's great about it?

137
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,460
It's cold. Let's go.

138
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,460
Don't leave yet. Stay here for a while.

139
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,490
Look, there are many stars in the sky.

140
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,560
Watch them.

141
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,590
Aren't they satellites?

142
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,460
There are so many of them.

143
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,990
- They can't be satellites. - Maybe you're right.

144
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,890
- Gosh. - Gosh, it's cold.

145
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,360
I want to go inside.

146
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,720
No, stay a little longer.

147
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,860
I only have a muffler on me.

148
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,360
You mean around your neck?

149
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,760
Either way, you're wearing a thick jacket.

150
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,160
Do you want to come into my arms?

151
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,990
My goodness. No way.

152
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,720
Stay here a little longer.

153
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,060
- Your nose bridge is so high. - What?

154
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,890
I'm jealous of you.

155
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,590
Whenever I put on glasses, they slide on my nose.

156
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,920
- Why? - My nose bridge is too low.

157
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,290
Bok Joo.

158
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,260
I can see that...

159
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,090
you're not so bad-looking.

160
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,220
Are you teasing me?

161
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,420
No, you're pretty.

162
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,290
No one other than my dad has said that.

163
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,720
You're just not bad-looking.

164
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:57,960
When I break up with someone I love

165
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:03,060
The world is over

166
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,660
That's right.

167
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,420
When you break up with someone, the world seems to end.

168
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,520
That's what love is.

169
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,620
Once in everyone's life

170
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,190
- You meet someone unforgettable - Coach Choi.

171
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,890
What are you doing? Why didn't you go home?

172
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,090
Professor Yoon.

173
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,060
Why are you here at this hour?

174
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,620
After a meeting,

175
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,330
I had dinner with other professors. I'm here to pick up my car.

176
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,620
I see. I was about to leave.

177
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,620
I see.

178
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:48,990
You wouldn't believe...

179
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,390
how much Professor Choi was bragging about his team...

180
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,920
winning all the gold medals.

181
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,260
I see. You must have been bored.

182
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,890
I should get going.

183
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,560
Wait, let's go together.

184
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,330
- I'll give you a ride. - It's okay.

185
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,620
We're going the opposite directions.

186
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,660
I'll see you tomorrow. Goodnight.

187
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,460
See you tomorrow.

188
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,260
Why was she so sad?

189
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,260
- Haneol. - Haneol.

190
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,920
Why are you panting? The jog wasn't long.

191
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,160
And you call yourselves athletes?

192
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,590
- We ran hard. - We did.

193
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,890
Forget it.

194
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,060
To prepare for next month's competition,

195
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,660
you'll start the training of the highest difficulty level.

196
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,290
Go inside and get warmed up.

197
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,720
- Go. - Gosh.

198
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,090
- Go in. - Are you ready?

199
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,330
Go inside.

200
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,890
Coach Choi.

201
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,220
Yes?

202
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,960
Don't drink alone from now on.

203
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,160
If you fall into a habit, you'll become alcoholic.

204
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,890
I was so tired.

205
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,420
I wanted to sleep at home after two cans of beer.

206
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,220
Let's drink together.

207
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,220
- Are you doing anything tonight? - Excuse me?

208
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,560
Why?

209
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,860
You don't want to drink with a man with a popped belly?

210
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,660
I wanted to treat you.

211
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,760
Sure, I'd like that.

212
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,590
Let's go out after the training.

213
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,160
The food stand I told you about makes good eel dish.

214
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,160
Si Ho.

215
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,490
- Yes? - Here. It's a present.

216
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,960
I sent the video of the competition in Moscow to your email.

217
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,190
Watch it carefully.

218
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,360
It will help you a lot for the competition.

219
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,220
- Keep it up. - Thank you.

220
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,160
- Isn't Coach Seong sly? - Why?

221
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,920
After the competition, she treats Si Ho so differently.

222
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,920
I guess her affection towards Si Ho came back.

223
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,660
Gosh. Soo Bin was her favorite for a while.

224
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,890
It won't last long.

225
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,690
Even if you glue back a broken bowl, it will break again soon.

226
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,290
Why isn't Mom answering her phone?

227
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,890
- Si Eon. - Si Ho.

228
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,820
- What brings you here? - Si Ho.

229
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,720
- What is it? Is something wrong? - I think Mom and Dad are...

230
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,560
getting divorced.

231
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,160
- What? - They have been fighting a lot.

232
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,320
Dad doesn't come home any more.

233
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,060
I think they're really getting divorced this time.

234
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,260
It's okay, Si Eon.

235
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,360
It's okay. Don't cry. It's going to be okay.

236
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,920
I'll take care of it. It's okay. Don't cry.

237
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,460
Si Eon told you after all. I told her not to tell you.

238
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,620
If she hadn't told me, when were you going to tell me?

239
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,420
After you sign the divorce papers?

240
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,260
Or when you and Dad meet someone else and get married again?

241
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,790
Were you going to keep this secret from me forever?

242
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,860
Don't raise your voice.

243
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,760
People will recognize you.

244
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,860
That doesn't matter right now.

245
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,620
I heard you sold our house,

246
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,420
and Dad has been a credit delinquent for a while now.

247
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,520
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

248
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,790
Don't worry about our divorce, either.

249
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,490
Just focus on your training.

250
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,190
How can I not worry? You're my parents.

251
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,590
- Si Ho. - I'll quit gymnastics.

252
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,290
I'll work and make money instead.

253
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,820
Who says you can? Who says you can quit gymnastics?

254
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,860
Do you think your life is just your own?

255
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,260
Wrong. Your life is a part of my life, too.

256
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,920
People point their finger at me and say I exploit my daughter.

257
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,590
I've been fighting with your dd every day...

258
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,060
and taking all the blame from Si Eon. What will you do with that?

259
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,460
That has burdened me the most.

260
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,090
The fact that my life is also your life.

261
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,760
Why are you being greedy over my life?

262
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,790
You should have lived your own life better.

263
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,820
Why did you have me and put me through all this?

264
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,760
Si Ho.

265
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:39,720
Gosh. Why would you come home at night and ask me to cook curry?

266
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,760
Come on. I suddenly missed the curry you make.

267
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,560
Great. I won't be able to marry anyone...

268
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,490
because no one makes curry better than you.

269
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,190
This is your mom's trick.

270
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,860
I'm also a victim.

271
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,860
You should have married a cook, then.

272
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,790
Why did you choose a pharmacist?

273
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,120
Hey. I made a slip of the tongue, didn't I?

274
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,660
Yes. I think so.

275
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,760
Here she comes.

276
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,090
Gosh, you're so annoying. Why are you in my seat?

277
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:17,460
Don't be like that. I was only joking.

278
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,420
Where's my curry?

279
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,790
You have abdominal obesity.

280
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,120
You're the one who has abdominal obesity.

281
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,220
I deserve to eat the dishes I made.

282
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,960
- I should just keep eating. - Eat up, dear.

283
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,120
I'll get straight to the result.

284
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,790
- I messed up. - Why?

285
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,820
When I tried to control my mind through the breathing,

286
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,320
I thought I'd be okay.

287
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,920
I need a refund for the counseling fee.

288
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,060
Gosh. I can't do that. I should make a living, too.

289
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,820
Listen. I'll buy you a meal. Don't tell anyone about this.

290
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,920
Why don't we...

291
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,990
think of it as a warm-up exercise,

292
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,360
and take it slow to solve it?

293
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,920
I'm sure we'll be able to find a good solution.

294
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,820
If we can't solve it by this year, I'll be doomed. I'm getting old.

295
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,860
That's true. You should be soaring high at this age.

296
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,420
Don't worry. Be happy.

297
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,020
By the way, it's about your mother.

298
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,890
Not the mother you have now, but your birth mother.

299
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,960
Didn't you want to look for her?

300
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,520
No.

301
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,220
I didn't.

302
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,390
Why? You must have been curious.

303
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:54,160
She must have reasons for severing contact with me.

304
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,190
I see.

305
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,920
Also, I guess I felt bad...

306
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,290
for my aunt and uncle.

307
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,420
Did you think it'd be betraying them?

308
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,990
My aunt raised me with her sincere heart.

309
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,920
Right. I think I know what you mean.

310
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,490
But I hope...

311
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,590
you will confront that matter squarely.

312
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,520
I mean your resentment towards your mother,

313
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,620
and your complicated emotions...

314
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,190
towards your uncle's family. Such as gratitude, guilt,

315
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,120
or tiredness from pretending you don't know the truth.

316
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,190
Those emotions should burst out at least once.

317
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,120
Only then you'll be completely free from...

318
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,160
the trauma you're having.

319
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,590
That's what I think.

320
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,990
I should really call Dr. Jeong.

321
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,720
Come on, Seon Ok.

322
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,160
I bought this for you. Please eat this sausage.

323
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,290
Forget it. I don't want to.

324
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,530
Can you move? I know I'm a non-person,

325
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,790
but this is still my bed.

326
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,320
Seon Ok. Can you stop, please?

327
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:24,320
I know you're hurt, but we didn't bully you on purpose.

328
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,460
You're right.

329
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,560
You didn't mean to hurt my feelings,

330
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,260
but I'm being a crybaby.

331
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,090
- That's not what I meant. - No.

332
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,990
It's all because I'm small-minded.

333
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,890
I'm so sorry for not being understandable,

334
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,320
and not having the personality that satisfies you.

335
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,060
Hey. Are you going to keep talking like that?

336
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,390
Gosh. Don't raise your voice.

337
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,660
I'm scared you might start fighting.

338
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,590
She keeps being sarcastic.

339
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,290
I'm disappointed in you, too.

340
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,290
Are you getting mad at me now, Bok Joo?

341
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,660
I'm sad enough as it is. Do you really have to do this?

342
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,360
Why are you getting angry at others for your own mistake?

343
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,260
Do you think this is fun for me?

344
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,260
So just stop it already!

345
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,260
I tried to, but I just can't.

346
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,290
You're too loud! Fight outside!

347
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:08,390
Gosh. Do you want the housemistress to kick us out?

348
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,860
Have you guys thought about how I feel?

349
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,590
After I came to Seoul...

350
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,660
and started school, I considered you as my sisters.

351
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,660
But I was deluding myself.

352
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,460
Don't overreact over one incident. We all feel the same way.

353
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,290
Bok Joo only told me...

354
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,460
because I saw her text message. She had no choice.

355
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,390
You should have told me when she got caught by Coach Choi.

356
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,360
You pretended that you knew nothing,

357
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,060
and told me we should wait because it must be hard for Bok Joo.

358
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,690
You made me sound like a bad friend.

359
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,060
That's not Nan Hee's fault. I asked her to keep it a secret.

360
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,160
So why did you make a secret in the first place?

361
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,320
Do you think I wanted to?

362
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,720
It was hard for me to keep it a secret, too.

363
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,620
I wanted to tell you all about it so badly.

364
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,190
But how could I?

365
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,290
I knew that I was doing something ridiculous.

366
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,090
You're my friends, but I knew you'd hate it.

367
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,720
How could I tell you? It's embarrassing.

368
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,060
Why is it embarrassing? We're friends.

369
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,290
If you told us, we'd understand. That's what friends are for.

370
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,990
Is that all we mean to you?

371
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,260
Seon Ok is right about that.

372
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,420
I'm sorry.

373
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,060
I thought you'd be disappointed and think I'm pathetic.

374
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,530
No. I'm sorry. Why are you crying?

375
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,190
It must have been so hard for you. I feel terrible.

376
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,690
Guys.

377
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:30,460
I won't keep anything secret from you again.

378
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,620
I promise.

379
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,260
Don't cry. You're making us feel bad.

380
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,720
I told you that my parents run a store.

381
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,420
It's not a store.

382
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,620
It's a motel. I couldn't tell you because it's embarrassing.

383
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,890
Hey. There's nothing wrong with that. Why did you hide it?

384
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,320
You wouldn't know...

385
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,530
how it feels to serve drinks and wet towels to customers at our age.

386
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,990
I'm no better.

387
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,620
I haven't kissed any guy, let alone have a deep kiss.

388
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,260
- That doesn't matter. - That's right.

389
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,620
It doesn't matter at all!

390
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,090
- Not at all! - You can kiss someone later.

391
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,460
I'm so sorry.

392
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,160
I really didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

393
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,390
I just...

394
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,030
made up an excuse, but things got...

395
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,920
- out of hand. - Bok Joo.

396
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,590
It's hot.

397
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,490
Slow down. You'll have indigestion again.

398
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,920
Well, I've had enteritis, but I've never had indigestion.

399
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,720
- What is indigestion? Awesome. - Awesome.

400
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,890
Saying "awesome" with you guys just feels right.

401
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,260
- You want fried rice, right? - Of course.

402
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,530
- 2 bowls? - I'm hungry. Let's get 3.

403
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,290
Excuse me, we'd like three bowls of rice to make fried rice!

404
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,530
Hey, the weekend starts tomorrow.

405
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,220
Shall we party it up today?

406
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,620
- What do you think? - What will you do to us this time?

407
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,420
Plus, Bok Joo has special training.

408
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,860
Right. You won't get any rest days for the next little while, right?

409
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,690
Both Coach Choi and Professor Yoon aren't taking any days off either,

410
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,760
so I should do my best.

411
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,260
That's too bad.

412
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,390
Then how about going to karaoke room?

413
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,760
I know that you are super stressed out because of Si Ho.

414
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,860
That's right, Song Si Ho.

415
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,690
I was trying to pretend I don't know anything,

416
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,120
- but I want to go teach that fox... - Hey, don't.

417
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,420
You don't need to put that dirty blood on your hands.

418
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,320
Let's just eat this and go to a karaoke room.

419
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,030
I'll pay for the karaoke room!

420
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,490
Let's go.

421
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,790
- Okay. - So? Shall we have dinner first?

422
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,120
- Or shall we just go for drinks? - Let's go for drinks.

423
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,590
We won't have room for drinks if we have dinner first.

424
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,760
How much are you planning on drinking?

425
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,290
You're scaring me.

426
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,320
I'm going to be honest with you.

427
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,120
I'm a lightweight compared to you.

428
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,720
No, don't say that.

429
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,920
I don't get drunk quickly only because I try to stay alert.

430
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,860
It sounds like you're implying that you'll let yourself go today.

431
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,890
Gosh, I'm terrified.

432
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:13,090
Goodness. That's not what I meant.

433
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,390
Gosh, what kind of person do you think I am...

434
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,820
Hey, Honey.

435
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:18,790
How?

436
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:22,420
I told you not to drive at night.

437
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,620
You're not an experienced driver.

438
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,560
Are you all right?

439
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,590
Okay. I'll be there shortly.

440
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,420
Don't cry.

441
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,420
All right.

442
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,260
- Was that your wife? - Yes. She got into an accident.

443
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,560
I'm sorry. I think I should go see her right away.

444
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,460
- Is she seriously injured? - No, she's not.

445
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,220
I think it scared her. She gets scared easily.

446
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,190
I'm sorry. I really wanted to treat you today.

447
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:54,590
Don't worry. You should get going.

448
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,120
Yes, I better go.

449
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,090
I'll buy you something delicious next time, okay?

450
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,090
- Hold on, where is my car key? - In your hand.

451
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,320
Right. See you.

452
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,890
Drive safely.

453
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,390
Do I just like him as a person?

454
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,690
Or do I still have feelings for him?

455
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:20,990
Although it was love

456
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:28,760
Even though I loved you

457
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,660
- Just like this - Just like this

458
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,320
- I look at you from afar - I look at you from afar

459
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,990
- And cannot get closer to you - And cannot get closer to you

460
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:55,960
- Nan Hee! - I didn't want it to be true

461
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,420
I didn't want to let you go

462
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:05,160
What if things go wrong and our love ends

463
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,490
My heart aches, but I have to ignore the pain

464
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,660
Because it'll be more painful than the breakup

465
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,320
In 1, 2, 3, 4!

466
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,590
- I can't believe that you left me - I can't believe that you left me

467
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:25,920
- I can't believe you abandoned me - I can't believe you abandoned me

468
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:29,290
- I cannot forget our love - I cannot forget our love

469
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:32,490
- It's too late, I'm already yours - It's too late, I'm already yours

470
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,860
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

471
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,820
Nan Hee, how can you get the dance move wrong every single time?

472
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,490
- Start from the left side! - This is my signature body wave.

473
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:44,520
Your signature body wave? Whatever.

474
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,190
- Nan Hee... - Speaking of which, I was...

475
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,920
so impressed by Bok Joo's vibrato.

476
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,060
Hey, hasn't my vibrato gotten better?

477
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,260
Seon Ok, how about my sexy body wave?

478
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,290
- That's enough. - Stop talking about that.

479
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,860
Let's focus on my vibrato, Nan Hee.

480
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,620
Wait, girls. I think we only have two minutes.

481
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,760
- My gosh! - No! I have to do my sexy dance.

482
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,690
Ma'am, please give us bonus time. It's almost up.

483
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,490
I already gave you girls additional 10 minutes.

484
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,790
We come here all the time, you know.

485
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,190
Hold on a second. What have you been doing to your skin?

486
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,560
It's glowing. For a second, I thought you were my age.

487
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,060
Fine. I'll give you additional 15 minutes. Are we good now?

488
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,290
Gosh, you rock.

489
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,990
Tell your dad that I said hi.

490
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,290
He hasn't been bringing leftover chicken lately.

491
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,990
Are you serious?

492
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,520
Gosh, what is he doing? I should have a word with him.

493
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,590
Go talk to him.

494
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,590
- Thank you. - Let's go, let's run

495
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,960
Mission accomplished!

496
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,820
Make some noise!

497
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,520
Fantastic baby

498
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,420
Fantastic baby

499
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,690
Dance, dance, dance

500
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,220
- Yes, we like to party - We like to party

501
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,060
- We're going to party - We're going to party

502
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:03,060
Open your heart, clear your head, bring on the fire

503
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,690
Who says you can quit gymnastics?

504
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,460
Do you think your life is just your own?

505
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,890
Wrong. Your life is a part of my life, too.

506
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,320
I've been fighting with your dad every day...

507
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:39,090
and taking all the blame from Si Eon. What will you do with that?

508
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,460
- Hello! - Yes, hello.

509
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,360
Why did you come alone?

510
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,590
What's wrong with it? Am I not allowed to come here alone?

511
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,260
Do I always have to bring people?

512
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,120
It looks like you've already had a drink or two.

513
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,220
I'll get pupa soup and a bottle of soju.

514
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,760
Sure!

515
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,790
Thank you.

516
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:18,190
You look a little different today.

517
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,720
- This is... - My goodness!

518
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,360
Your makeup isn't sitting right.

519
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,690
I bet your date stood you up. Aren't I right?

520
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,720
Gosh! I can't believe this.

521
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,720
Aren't I getting my pupa soup?

522
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,890
I just put it on the stove. I have to heat it up first.

523
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,990
Gosh, why does this taste like it's burnt?

524
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,460
My goodness.

525
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,790
Why are you sitting down?

526
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,090
It's not like I'm sitting on our lap. This is my chair.

527
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,860
I felt bad that you're drinking solo and wanted to keep you company...

528
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,990
Are you normally that twisted?

529
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:55,160
Are you normally that nosy?

530
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,290
Look at that. You always have to win, don't you?

531
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,320
Don't drink too much, seriously.

532
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,460
I usually drink until I drop.

533
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,260
Whatever.

534
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,320
You probably can't even take a lot of alcohol.

535
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,890
Gosh, snot came out of my nose.

536
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,420
My head is splitting.

537
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,790
Goodness.

538
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,160
It's Bok Joo.

539
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,860
Where am I?

540
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,020
You woke up, Coach Choi.

541
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,820
I'm really sorry, Chang Geol.

542
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,120
- I'm so sorry. - Don't worry about it.

543
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,290
You can certainly stay over at my place when you're drunk.

544
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,520
Have a seat.

545
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,620
I'm making beansprout soup for your hangover.

546
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,990
No, it's okay. I'm being a huge nuisance to you.

547
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,320
- I'll get going. - What are you talking about?

548
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,590
I got up early to make this soup for you.

549
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,320
Just have a seat.

550
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,820
You woke up.

551
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,460
Have a seat. You should have this soup, too. Sit down.

552
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,820
Yes. I should eat it for my hangover.

553
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:22,890
Well...

554
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,920
Did I make any mistake last night?

555
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,460
Why do you ask?

556
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,190
Did something happen?

557
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,420
I also blacked out in the middle of drinking with you, so...

558
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,660
Why does the soup taste like soju?

559
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,520
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

560
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,920
Oh, my.

561
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,320
- Ouch. - Gosh.

562
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,760
I'm sorry.

563
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,290
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

564
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,660
Coach?

565
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,990
Coach...

566
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,160
I had lost my mind.

567
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,290
How could I fall asleep there?

568
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,920
What an embarrassment.

569
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,260
- Coach Choi. - That startled me.

570
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,690
You're wearing the same clothes. Didn't you go home last night?

571
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:36,720
Yes, I did.

572
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,320
I like this outfit, so I have several of it.

573
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,090
I don't think it's that nice.

574
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,120
(Weight)

575
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,660
45kg. You made the cut.

576
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,720
It's impossible for everyone to make the cut.

577
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,060
The scale can't be wrong.

578
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,160
My dear scale.

579
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,960
Here's what was inside.

580
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,790
I knew it. What is this?

581
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,320
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

582
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,360
Who's the perpetrator?

583
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,220
Are you not going to tell me?

584
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,760
Fine, starting tomorrow,

585
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,820
we'll use an accurate electronic scale.

586
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,720
What are you doing? That's not enough to break it.

587
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,290
Move out of the way.

588
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,390
Break, break.

589
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,360
- Gosh, you startled me. - Goodness.

590
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:01,320
Did I startle you? It's just me.

591
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,690
Why are you here at this hour?

592
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,460
I wanted to practice.

593
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,820
Bok Joo, don't stick out your bottom.

594
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,020
Keep it engaged.

595
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,990
You have to engage your legs more.

596
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,720
Why did you place your arm there? Let's try it again.

597
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,090
- Let's go. - Let's see.

598
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,090
Okay, keep it there.

599
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,360
That's right. Great.

600
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,020
Hello.

601
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,620
I'm here, Professor Yoon and Coach Choi.

602
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,920
- Hello. - Hello, Sir.

603
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,360
Goodness, you can't take your weekend off because of Bok Joo.

604
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,890
I brought a lot for you to keep for a while.

605
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:49,060
We're only doing our job.

606
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,120
I'm sorry.

607
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,520
- Coach Choi. - Yes? Okay.

608
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,060
Coach Choi, I see you again today after this morning.

609
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,890
Professor Yoon, I'll take these downstairs.

610
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:03,190
- The athletes might finish it all. - Okay.

611
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,560
- May I take them? - Sure.

612
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,660
I'm sorry.

613
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,660
Are you working hard?

614
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,090
She is.

615
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,490
Don't worry about her.

616
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,020
- Have some food. Aren't you hungry? - Thank you.

617
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,520
Woon Gi, come and eat with us.

618
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,390
(Dr. Jeong)

619
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,060
I'm going to use the restroom.

620
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,560
Go ahead.

621
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,890
(Dr. Jeong)

622
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:50,960
(Calling Dr. Jeong)

623
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:58,090
Hello, Bok Joo.

624
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,820
I'm sorry for not picking up the phone.

625
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,890
I thought you'd make an appointment this week, but you haven't called.

626
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,590
Is something wrong?

627
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,190
No.

628
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,820
Actually...

629
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,990
It's okay. You can tell me.

630
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:19,860
Actually,

631
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,160
I don't think...

632
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,190
I can go to the clinic any more.

633
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,960
You can't come at all?

634
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,020
Why not?

635
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,930
Actually...

636
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,430
I'm going to study abroad.

637
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,620
Study abroad?

638
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,560
Is it to play the cello? Where are you going? Germany?

639
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:43,290
Well, yes, to Germany.

640
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,290
That sounds great.

641
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,560
I should congratulate you, but I feel somewhat sad.

642
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,460
It feels like saying goodbye to a close friend.

643
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,060
Anyway, congratulations. Good luck in Germany.

644
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,520
Don't forget about me when you get famous. Sign me an autograph, too.

645
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,960
Okay.

646
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,960
Take care, Dr. Jeong.

647
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,360
Okay. Good luck, Bok Joo.

648
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:39,260
Stop crying, Bok Joo. This isn't something to cry about.

649
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,360
Stop it.

650
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,960
- Hey, Chubs. - It's me.

651
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:12,190
I know it's you. What's with your voice?

652
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,290
Is something wrong?

653
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,090
I called Dr. Jeong and told him...

654
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,060
that I can't come to the clinic any more.

655
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,490
What did he say?

656
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,930
He didn't say much.

657
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,690
Did you cry?

658
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:34,460
Where are you? Are you already out?

659
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:38,260
No, I'm in my room. Where are you?

660
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,690
What is your wish these days?

661
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,490
I wish that the person I like will like me back.

662
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,430
But it's hopeless.

663
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:00,460
I still pray for it out of habit. Otherwise, I'd feel sad.

664
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,260
What did you tell him about not going there any more?

665
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,490
I said I'm going to study abroad.

666
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:08,520
To play the cello.

667
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,930
You must have thought about it carefully.

668
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,220
Don't laugh. This is all because of you.

669
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:21,060
I'm sorry, but I didn't mean it to happen.

670
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,620
Forget it. It already happened.

671
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:28,790
You aren't the one to be blamed. I blame love.

672
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,360
You might become a poet after being in unrequited love.

673
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,220
I'm more sentimental than you think.

674
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,090
To be honest,

675
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,620
this is what pains me the most.

676
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,360
Until the very end,

677
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,390
I had to lie to Dr. Jeong.

678
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:54,760
I wanted to be honest to him at least once.

679
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,120
Don't think too much. You'll get a headache.

680
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,820
Just think of it as your first love and let it go.

681
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:04,090
Isn't their last love more important to women than their first love?

682
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,990
I'll never find love again.

683
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:09,360
I might do weightlifting until I die.

684
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,720
That's just self-pity.

685
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,620
No, that's just the reality.

686
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,320
I should come back to senses and focus on weightlifting.

687
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,060
When do you finish your training today?

688
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,820
Shall we go clubbing again? It's time for you to treat me.

689
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,690
No, maybe next time.

690
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:31,820
- I don't have enough strength. - Then what about movie?

691
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,190
I'll treat you to everything including popcorn and drinks.

692
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:35,990
The movies?

693
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,860
Really?

694
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:41,660
Usually, I don't go to the movies with my friends...

695
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,430
because it's a waste of time,

696
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,720
but I've done something wrong, and you also gave me some coins.

697
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,690
I always return what I receive.

698
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,290
What do you think?

699
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,760
You'll go, won't you?

700
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,190
At what time?

701
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,190
We watch what I want.

702
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:07,460
Bok Sil, which moment do you remember the most?

703
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,190
That wench.

704
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:15,460
What are you looking at? I'm going to punch you.

705
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,760
Let's go.

706
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,430
Right this moment.

707
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,320
- What about you? - Isn't it an adult university?

708
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,790
What I'm saying is...

709
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,120

711
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,090
Hello.

712
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,220
- I have an upset stomach. - You don't look so good.

713
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,520
Take this. If it doesn't get better,

714
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,660
you should go see a doctor.

715
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,990
Thank you.

717
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,990
My gosh! Miss.

718
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,620
Are you all right?

719
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,720
It's from Canada.

720
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:09,560
Christmas is right around the corner, you know.

721
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:11,560
She remembers every year.

722
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,660
She sure loves Joon Hyung so much.

723
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:18,190
- What are you doing? Open it. - I should.

724
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,890
What did she send this time?

725
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,820
My gosh, it's so nice.

726
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,120
Isn't this totally your style?

727
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,860
It certainly is. It looks like the newest model.

728
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,620
Go ahead and try it on.

729
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,520
It fits perfectly.

730
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,720
Of course it does.

731
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,260
Gosh, it really fits you perfectly.

732
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:57,060
How does she know your shoe size so well?

733
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,690
Honey, I'm so amazed.

734
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:01,060
Parents and children must really have an inseparable bond.

735
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,320
- I know, right? - Mom, I have to head out now.

736
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:05,860
Are you not going to eat?

737
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,490
I'm sorry. I'll eat when I get back.

738
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,860
We shouldn't have gotten his exact size.

739
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,560
We should have gone a size up.

740
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,620
We can't get a bigger size just for that reason.

741
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,430
He won't be able to wear them.

(Dear my beloved son, Joon Hyung)

743
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:32,220
By the way, didn't you want to...

744
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,220
look for her?

745
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,620
But I hope...

746
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,860
you will confront that matter squarely.

(Si Ho)

750
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,220
Hey, what's up?

751
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:21,560
Gosh, why isn't he here yet? Does he want to get punched or what?

752
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,560
Shall I buy tickets now?

753
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,620
Gosh, what an eyesore.

754
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,860
Get a room, will you?

755
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:38,990
Gosh, I'm so annoyed.

756
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:47,790
Are you still dizzy?

757
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,120
You got a shot, so you'll feel better soon.

758
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:52,760
I'm sorry.

759
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,190
You were the only person who came to my mind.

760
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:59,720
Shouldn't you be going home instead of the dormitory?

761
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,320
My parents are getting divorced.

762
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:04,860
It'll be a complete mess there.

763
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,260
If I go home,

764
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,220
I'll feel sick again.

765
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:13,760
I didn't know,

766
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,560
but we'll lose our house, too.

767
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,620
We couldn't pay back the loan.

768
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,460
Just so that I can pursue gymnastics,

769
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,920
my family has been making too many sacrifices.

770
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:28,820
I feel burdened by that,

771
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:32,290
and the sacrifices my family members have made...

772
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,520
left them all wounded and scarred.

773
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,760
I wouldn't even have started it if I had known how hard it'd be.

774
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:45,360
I was too young back then,

775
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:49,020
and I can't quit now.

776
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:52,660
I've come way too far for that.

777
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:14,060
Is he coming or not?

778
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:16,690
Gosh, seriously.

779
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,220
I shouldn't get better.

780
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:33,990
I'm so happy to have you looking after me.

781
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,660
Hey. You can go alone from here, right?

782
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:37,890
I have to meet someone.

783
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:39,620
Can you stay with me for a little longer?

784
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:40,760
I have to go. I'm late.

785
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:46,660
Don't forget to take your medicine.

786
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:54,660
You jerk.

787
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:56,360
How dare you stand me up?

788
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,920
Do you think I have that much time to waste?

789
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,720
Gosh, you're such a jerk

790
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,990
I seriously can't believe you.

791
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:03,560
I'm your friend, not your family.

792
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,990
I'm just speechless!

793
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:07,160
Hey, you need a serious lesson.

794
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,720
You're honestly so full of it.

795
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,690
What? You'll take me to the movies? You'll treat me?

796
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:12,560
You're dead now.

797
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,620
Die!

798
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:16,660
Gosh, this jerk.

799
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,220
Nice, Stage Three. Okay.

800
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,820
The customer you're calling is not available at the moment.

801
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,890
Gosh, why is she not picking up?

802
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,520
Did she leave already?

803
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:30,990
Goodness, she'll kill me.

804
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:32,720
Die! Get a taste of this!

805
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,560
Die, I'll kill you. Die!

806
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,490
Die, die, die!

807
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,660
Get a taste of this!

808
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,660
Die. You get out of there.

809
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:43,290
Die! Go away. Die!

810
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:45,790
Die, die, die! I'll shoot you to death!

811
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:47,720
Take the bullet! Here it comes!

812
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:50,520
Hey, you! Die. Die!

813
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,920
The movie is over. Why did you come?

814
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,360
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

815
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,890
I'm going to play this game. Do not distract me.

816
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,620
- I'm sorry. - Gosh, this scum.

817
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:04,190
- Bok Joo, I'm sorry. - You need to die.

818
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,690
Hey, I'm sorry.

819
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:07,790
I'm really sorry. Forgive me, please?

820
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,390
You're really sorry, yet you can't tell me why you stood me up?

821
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:13,120
I want to punch you so badly.

822
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,390
Okay, fine. Just punch me!

823
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:17,290
Punch me. Hit me.

824
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,360
No guy has ever stood me up before.

825
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,090
I bet you've never gone to the movies with a guy.

826
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:28,390
Hey. You punched me once, so you'll forgive me, right?

827
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:29,890
I'll treat you to something delicious.

828
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:32,390
You like barbecue, right? How about we go for barbecue?

829
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:34,720
You have to treat me. Were you going to just call it a night?

830
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,090
Okay! Let's go, Chubs.

831
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,360
Pork isn't good enough for today.

832
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,820
It better be beef, beef barbecue.

833
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,120
Beef?

834
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,990
All right. I won't eat, then.

835
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:53,690
Hey, will you have room for barbecue after this?

836
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:55,360
I didn't even eat much.

837
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:56,490
Fish cakes aren't even filling.

838
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,060
Hey, you'll hurt yourself.

839
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:02,960
- Here. - Thanks.

840
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:07,720
Goodness. You're so clumsy.

841
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:10,720
Gosh, your boyfriend is so sweet.

842
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,690
- Good for you. - He's not my boyfriend.

843
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:13,790
Then is he your husband?

844
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,360
You must've gotten married early. You two look so young.

845
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,690
- We're not married! - We're not married.

846
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:21,020
Hey, do you want to eat more?

847
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,620
Yes, this one. I'm not done yet.

848
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,620
All right. Eat up.

849
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:27,920
If you get full from this, I won't have to spend much money.

850
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:30,890
- How much do we owe you? - Hey, wait!

851
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:33,160
I'd like a corn dog, as well.

852
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,090
This is so good. I'll eat one more of this.

853
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,220
How can you devour everything at the fishcake place...

854
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,420
and still eat four servings of meat?

855
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:47,120
That's nothing impressive in my team.

856
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:49,420
You're seriously unbelievable.

857
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,460
Anyway, thanks for the food, Joon Hyung.

858
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:53,920
Thanks to you, I was able to de-stress.

859
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:57,290
All right. Make sure to take a digestive aid before going to bed.

860
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,120
I've already digested everything.

861
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:02,620
You spent so much money today.

862
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:05,090
Well, you had to make up for what you did.

863
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:07,660
Yes. I'm a horrible friend.

864
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,760
- I'm so terribly sorry. - Hold on.

865
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:11,690
Are you being sarcastic now?

866
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,620
You still haven't learned your lesson!

867
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:21,260
- Hey... - You still have a lot to learn.

868
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,060
Hey, let go! Gosh, seriously.

869
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,620
- Let go of me first. - You're too much.

870
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,860
(Deleting 4 photos.)

871
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,420
(Deleting 2 photos.)

872
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:01,120
(Your album is empty.)

873
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,560
Pay attention to your legs.

874
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,190
Watch your feet. Yes.

875
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:36,620
- It's so nice to see you, Ma'am. - I haven't seen you for so long.

876
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,790
- I've been very busy. - I see.

877
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:40,090
What brings you here, Mom?

878
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:43,660
I brought you japchae and other dishes for you all.

879
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,220
It must be for Dr. Jeong's birthday.

880
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:47,820
Thank you, Ms. Lee.

881
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:50,690
You shouldn't have to. I was going to buy them dinner.

882
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:52,490
You can still buy them dinner.

883
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:54,160
This is just what I wanted to do.

884
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:56,590
Jae Yi. Come here.

885
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:01,990
Please give this to your friend, Ah Young.

886
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,620
- What? - She lives alone.

887
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:06,860
I doubt that she cooks proper meals for herself.

888
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:10,160
I packed some side dishes as well.

889
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,660
Give it to her today, or it'll go bad.

890
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,260
Gosh, Mom. You shouldn't...

891
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:17,690
- This is too much. - Why is it too much?

892
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,090
I can share food with your friend, can't I?

893
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,060
Also, you're supposed to share the food for one's birthday...

894
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,390
to live a long life.

895
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,690
Is that the real reason?

896
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:29,260
What else would it be?

897
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:31,490
Are you two more than friends?

898
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:34,220
I'm grateful that you're considerate of my friend,

899
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,960
but don't expect something more. I don't want to lose my friend.

900
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:40,160
Gosh. I didn't say anything.

901
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,690
I'm being nice to her, so you can stay as her friend.

902
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,960
Next time, invite her to our house.

903
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:49,260
Tell her I feel lonely because I don't have a daughter.

904
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:50,320
Okay?

905
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,260
All right.

907
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:04,220
Good.

908
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:05,890
- You did it. - That's right.

909
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,220
Bok Joo. That was 80 percent success.

910
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:12,090
Can you make it 90 percent right away? You can take a break first.

911
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:15,560
- I can do it. - Way to go, Bok Joo.

912
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,020
I think Bok Joo will break the record today.

913
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,360
If she can...

914
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,690
Here we go.

915
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,990
- Let's go! - Go, Bok Joo!

916
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:27,060
Let's go!

917
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,660
Get ready. Flex your back, and watch your front leg.

918
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:32,890
Take a deep breath.

919
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,120
- Are you okay? - What's wrong? Is it your back?

920
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,260
I think the muscles are cramped up a bit. It's okay.

921
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,790
You don't seem okay. Go to the infirmary.

922
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,090
You don't want to let it get worse. Coach Choi, call the infirmary.

923
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:58,260
- Okay. Massage her back. - Yes. Here.

924
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,120
Are you okay?

925
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,390
Gosh, I should fix it quickly.

926
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:08,860
Hey, Chubs!

927
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:13,590
Chubs.

928
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:17,320
Where are you going?

929
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,590
I'm going to the infirmary. Don't mind me and go.

930
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,090
Did you get hurt while training?

931
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,120
You should have been careful.

932
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:29,120
What about you? Where are you going?

933
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:32,260
To give my brother... Gosh. I'm just going out.

934
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:34,960
All right. I'll see you later.

935
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,260
Get a good massage.

936
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:40,690
If you mention my name to Ms. Go, she will treat you better.

937
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,820
Look at that. Gosh.

938
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:45,420
It looks like she's not badly hurt.

939
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,820
I almost said I was going out to give Jae Yi a birthday present.

940
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,060
I should watch my words.

941
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:09,660
Gosh. I should place it where everyone can see it.

942
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:16,820
Okay.

943
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,460
- Joon Hyung. I brought you a drink. - Thank you.

944
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,490
Is that a birthday gift for Dr. Jeong? What is it?

945
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:33,490
It's a speaker. Don't I have a great taste?

946
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:37,490
- I want to show him. Did he go out? - He went out to see his friend.

947
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:40,160
I think he said he was going to your school.

948
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,720
He must have gone to see Ms. Go...

949
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:48,490
My mom packed a few dishes for you.

950
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:49,860
Can I really accept it?

951
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:52,990
If I do, are you going to lecture me again?

952
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,460
I'm not going to do that. I know I was wrong.

953
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:00,420
By the way, it looks like my mom liked you the other day.

954
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,760
Hey. But I can't go out right now.

955
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,260
I have a student who hurt her back.

956
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,690
Then I should deliver it to you myself.

957
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:15,590
The person you're trying to reach is not available.

958
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:18,860

960
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:24,490
If you're here, park your car and come on up. Okay.

961
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,660
Let's leave it on for another 20 minutes.

962
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,520
Luckily, I don't think you need a painkiller.

963
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:33,320
Okay.

964
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,590
Bok Joo, please pick up. There's no time!

965
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,220
Hey, Joon Hyung.

966
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:53,020
Tae Kwon. Go to the infirmary and get Chubs out of there.

967
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,220
You must not let my brother see her.

968
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,520
Just get her out of there. Okay?

969
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:57,690
Gosh.

970
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,790
- Hi, Tae Kwon. - Hey.

971
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:02,620
Gosh, it's good that I ran into you.

972
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,660
There is an emergency.

973
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,120
You must go to the parking lot,

974
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,490
find a gray SUV which just came in.

975
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:10,560
After that, stall the driver no matter what.

976
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:12,890
It's because Joon Hyung's brother is on that car.

977
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:16,590
Joon Hyung says if he goes to the infirmary, he will see Bok Joo.

978
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:18,360
- Oh, my gosh. - That means...

979
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,890
- Let's find that car. - Okay.

980
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:23,960
What is happening? I thought the crisis was over.

981
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,390
We shouldn't let him find out. Keep running.

982
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,020
- That's the car. - Let's go.

983
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:33,990
Stop! Stop!

984
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:38,120
- Nan Hee! Are you okay? - Gosh.

985
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,490
- Nan Hee! - My goodness.

986
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:42,860
How can you drive so poorly?

987
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,960
You should see if there is a person on the road.

988
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,160
What are you doing?

989
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,960
- That's not him, Seon Ok. - It's not?

990
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:51,360
What? Where is he, then?

991
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,690
He should be here by now.

992
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,820
Bok Joo. Are you in there?

993
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,420
Bok Joo. This is an emergency. You should get out now.

994
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:27,390
Joon Hyung's brother is on his way here now.

995
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:28,420
What?

996
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:31,560
I don't know why it's an emergency, but Joon Hyung wants you to get out.

997
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:34,520
- Hurry up. - Did your mom make all these?

998
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,160
I told you my mom is a great cook.

999
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,420
She made so many dishes.

1000
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:47,920
Hey. Please say thank you to your mom for me.

1001
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,290
And please tell her that I won't stretch the meaning of this. Okay?

1002
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:53,690
Gosh. I made one mistake, and you're giving me...

1003
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:54,990
such a hard time.

1004
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:58,060
You should have a harder time. I'll keep bringing it up.

1005
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:59,720
Fine. I'm sorry.

1006
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:02,760
- Jae Yi! - What? Why are you here?

1007
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,060
- Did you know I was here? - Yes.

1008
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:06,920
I went to your clinic to give you a present.

1009
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:10,090
Anyway, I want to eat patbingsu.

1010
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,390
Ms. Go, you should come, too. Jae Yi will pay.

1011
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:14,490
- What? - Don't be absurd. It's cold.

1012
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:16,790
You don't even like sweets. Why would you want to eat patbingsu?

1013
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:18,590
No, I love patbingsu.

1014
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:21,020
Fine. I'll buy you one. Let's go together.

1015
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,320
Give me a second.

1016
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:29,920
- Jae Yi! - Gosh.

1017
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,990
Listen. I'll be out for a while.

1018
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:34,590
Stay here for five more minutes. Also, massage your back at night.

1019
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,360
Okay.

1020
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,590
- Let's go, shall we? - Let's go.

1021
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:42,790
- Okay. - All right. Let's go.

1022
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:45,760
- Come on. Let's go. - Why are you in such a rush?

1023
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,420
- Hurry up. - What's wrong with you today?

1024
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:49,190
Nothing. I just want to eat patbingsu.

1025
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:17,460
Jae Yi is gone. We're okay now.

1026
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:21,360
Hello, Ms. Go?

1027
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:24,090
Jae Yi just took off.

1028
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,860
What? Did he leave his phone at the infirmary?

1029
00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:32,990
Gosh. How clumsy.

1030
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,260
All right. I'll go and pick it up. Okay.

1031
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:41,620
Gosh. What a nasty day!

1032
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:45,420
I'm running around all day!

1037
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:47,720
Why did she sign up at the clinic? I mean, she's a weightlifter.

Who's the guy she likes?

Nothing happened, right?

01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,020
Is there a match today?
