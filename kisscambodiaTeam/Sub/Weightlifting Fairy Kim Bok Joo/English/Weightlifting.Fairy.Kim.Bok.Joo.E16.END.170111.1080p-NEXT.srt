2
00:00:12,495 --> 00:00:14,455
Yes. We turned the lights off already.

3
00:00:15,895 --> 00:00:18,625
I just came out to a quiet place.

4
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:21,695
My roommate,

5
00:00:21,695 --> 00:00:24,225
who plays for Yeonnam City Hall, is a light sleeper.

6
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,425
How was your training today?

7
00:00:27,255 --> 00:00:30,095
Good. I shortened my record again by 0.2 second.

8
00:00:31,225 --> 00:00:34,725
I might not only join you there, but become a star player like Phelps.

9
00:00:35,295 --> 00:00:36,525
I like him.

10
00:00:38,155 --> 00:00:41,525
What about you? How is your back?

11
00:00:42,055 --> 00:00:43,125
Well...

12
00:00:43,755 --> 00:00:45,825
It won't heal any time soon. It's a chronic illness.

13
00:00:46,855 --> 00:00:48,195
You lost weight again, didn't you?

14
00:00:48,795 --> 00:00:52,155
I saw your picture, and your face has gotten even smaller.

15
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:57,325
No. I'm just lovesick. It's because I miss you.

16
00:00:58,095 --> 00:01:00,995
Gosh. Why aren't I losing weight, then?

17
00:01:01,155 --> 00:01:02,455
I miss you, too.

18
00:01:03,465 --> 00:01:07,095
I miss you, Seon Ok, and Nan Hee.

19
00:01:07,255 --> 00:01:10,225
I also miss the fried chicken my dad and uncle make.

20
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:13,625
You call your dad often, right?

21
00:01:14,755 --> 00:01:16,525
Yes. I talked to him on the phone earlier.

22
00:01:17,225 --> 00:01:20,255
His voice sounded weak. Maybe it's because I'm not there.

23
00:01:21,295 --> 00:01:22,325
All right.

24
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:24,725
I'll come by his restaurant tomorrow...

25
00:01:24,725 --> 00:01:26,495
and check on him.

26
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:29,925
Okay. Thank you.

28
00:01:34,955 --> 00:01:36,495
Now that I'm here in Taereung,

29
00:01:37,095 --> 00:01:40,525
things that happened back in school seem like a dream.

30
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:44,525
I realize how happy I was,

31
00:01:45,225 --> 00:01:48,655
and how blessed I was to have such good people around me.

32
00:01:50,655 --> 00:01:51,725
Joon Hyung.

33
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:53,725
Joon Hyung?

34
00:01:55,355 --> 00:01:57,355
Are you asleep? Are you?

35
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,255
You're asleep.

36
00:02:04,455 --> 00:02:06,395
Gosh. I fought off...

37
00:02:06,395 --> 00:02:08,725
the urge to sleep and waited to call you,

38
00:02:08,725 --> 00:02:09,955
but you fell asleep.

39
00:02:11,525 --> 00:02:14,655
Come to think of it, it seems I like you more than you like me now.

40
00:02:14,995 --> 00:02:16,155
It hurts my pride.

41
00:02:18,425 --> 00:02:19,925
Hey. Who's there?

42
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:26,955
I must follow the rules.

43
00:02:27,325 --> 00:02:29,425
I must follow the rules.

44
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:31,825
I must follow the rules.

45
00:02:31,825 --> 00:02:33,995
I must follow the rules.

46
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:36,495
I must follow the rules.

47
00:02:36,495 --> 00:02:38,495
I must follow the rules.

Joon Hyung. Joon Hyung!

50
00:02:54,825 --> 00:02:57,755
You said you'd go to the cyber cafe with me. I even massaged my hands.

51
00:02:57,755 --> 00:02:59,595
I have a place to go. I'll see you later.

52
00:02:59,895 --> 00:03:00,895
Where is it?

53
00:03:01,395 --> 00:03:03,395
Hey, Joon Hyung. Hey!

54
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:07,795
Gosh, where is he rushing so much to?

55
00:03:07,795 --> 00:03:08,925
Did something good happen?

56
00:03:11,255 --> 00:03:13,225
- Hi, Tae Kwon. 
- Hello.

57
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:16,655
We're going to the cafeteria. Join us.

58
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:18,595
- All right. 
- Let's go.

59
00:03:19,555 --> 00:03:21,395
- Awesome. 
- I love the cafeteria.

Did something happen?

65
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:47,555
I should ask.

66
00:03:49,455 --> 00:03:50,725
Hello? This is Kim Dae Ho.

67
00:03:51,395 --> 00:03:54,725
Hello, Mr. Kim? This is Jeong Joon Hyung, Bok Joo's friend.

68
00:03:55,155 --> 00:03:57,395
Oh, you're Bok Joo's future husband.

69
00:03:58,725 --> 00:04:00,355
Yes. That's right.

70
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:03,525
Well... Is everything okay?

71
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,795
Your restaurant is closed.

72
00:04:08,195 --> 00:04:09,295
What brings you here?

73
00:04:09,795 --> 00:04:12,225
I heard you were in the hospital, and I thought I should come.

74
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:16,055
Are you feeling okay?

75
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,095
Yes. He's fine.

76
00:04:18,095 --> 00:04:20,525
He's staying here because they need to treat his stomach ulcer...

77
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:22,755
and optimize his condition before the surgery.

78
00:04:23,795 --> 00:04:26,555
Well, I thought you and Bok Joo were just friends.

79
00:04:27,525 --> 00:04:29,955
Why do you care so much that your friend's dad is sick?

80
00:04:31,055 --> 00:04:32,955
You should be thankful that he cares.

81
00:04:33,325 --> 00:04:35,325
You have such a nasty temper.

82
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:38,695
A nasty temper? How dare you talk to your brother like that?

83
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,925
It's been too long since I gave you a good beating, right? You punk.

84
00:04:41,925 --> 00:04:44,525
You didn't have to get him anything.

85
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:47,595
All right. Here you go.

86
00:04:50,555 --> 00:04:52,325
When are you going to have the surgery?

87
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:53,925
They gave us a date,

88
00:04:54,755 --> 00:04:56,695
but it's the same day as Bok Joo's tournament.

89
00:04:56,695 --> 00:04:59,525
We've been worried that Bok Joo might find out.

90
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:05,255
Listen. I say this out of concern.

91
00:05:05,895 --> 00:05:08,165
Don't you tell Bok Joo about this. Do you hear me?

92
00:05:09,165 --> 00:05:10,895
She'll have a match soon. If she finds out,

93
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:12,625
she won't focus on her training.

94
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:14,395
She worked so hard to make the national team.

95
00:05:14,895 --> 00:05:18,165
Okay. I promise you I will keep that in mind.

96
00:05:27,525 --> 00:05:28,525
Yes, Bok...

97
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:32,525
I'm training right now, so I'll call you back when I'm done. Okay.

98
00:05:34,755 --> 00:05:37,995
What's going on? He fell asleep last night, and now this?

99
00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:41,295
I wanted to hear his voice.

100
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:47,125
What is it? Didn't your boyfriend pick up?

101
00:05:47,725 --> 00:05:50,725
What? He did, but he said he will call me back later.

102
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,295
I didn't know you had a boyfriend. Show us his picture.

103
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:55,695
Let's see what he looks like.

104
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:00,395
Here.

105
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,825
Hey. Are you really saying he's your boyfriend?

106
00:06:04,825 --> 00:06:07,355
Don't lie to us. You got these pictures from the internet, right?

107
00:06:07,855 --> 00:06:09,555
No. He's in my school's swimming team.

108
00:06:09,555 --> 00:06:11,695
Maybe you did something great in your previous life.

109
00:06:11,695 --> 00:06:14,555
He's so handsome. It's like she won a lottery.

110
00:06:14,555 --> 00:06:16,855
But apparently, she can't get her handsome boyfriend...

111
00:06:16,855 --> 00:06:18,055
on the phone.

112
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:20,995
That's not a good sign.

113
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:23,025
I think you two are going to break up soon.

114
00:06:24,355 --> 00:06:26,795
- What? 
- 90 percent of the athletes who...

115
00:06:26,795 --> 00:06:28,125
have a girlfriend or a boyfriend...

116
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:31,055
go through a breakup after coming here.

117
00:06:31,295 --> 00:06:32,455
But there're stages.

118
00:06:32,855 --> 00:06:35,525
At first, it gets harder to get him on the phone.

119
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:38,125
He either ignores your call, or says he'll call back later. Then,

120
00:06:38,355 --> 00:06:41,125
he will sound aloof, and his answers will be very short.

121
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,825
And finally, he will drop the bomb.

122
00:06:44,325 --> 00:06:46,395
"I'm sorry. I think we should break up."

123
00:06:46,595 --> 00:06:48,155
"I'm seeing someone else."

124
00:06:51,425 --> 00:06:53,655
No way. He's just training right now, so...

125
00:06:54,655 --> 00:06:56,155
- Gosh, I'm sorry. 
- Hey.

126
00:06:56,155 --> 00:06:58,525
He's not training. It's lunch time.

127
00:06:58,525 --> 00:06:59,695
We went to a sports university, too.

128
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:03,225
With your boyfriend's looks,

129
00:07:03,825 --> 00:07:05,455
I'll give it a month at the longest.

130
00:07:05,455 --> 00:07:07,955
Girls would never leave him alone. Am I right?

131
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:11,955
Seon Ok, Tae Kwon.

132
00:07:11,955 --> 00:07:13,625
- The hot dogs are here. 
- What took you so long?

133
00:07:14,555 --> 00:07:16,995
I brought hot dogs. There's no ketchup.

134
00:07:16,995 --> 00:07:19,825
- Why? You have no tact at all. 
- They didn't have it.

135
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:26,025
The food tastes so much better now that you're filling in for Bok Joo.

136
00:07:26,495 --> 00:07:28,925
Tae Kwon. I'll have you as our new member. Okay?

137
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:31,225
Sure. I'll be honored. Count me in.

138
00:07:31,225 --> 00:07:34,295
Okay. We're now the new trio.

139
00:07:36,525 --> 00:07:38,395
- It's our former member. 
- It's Bok Joo.

140
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,725
Hey, Bok Joo. You're calling me in a very long time.

141
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:43,325
I almost forget how your voice sounded.

142
00:07:44,325 --> 00:07:46,295
That's why I'm calling you now.

143
00:07:46,695 --> 00:07:47,755
How are you, Nan Hee?

144
00:07:48,255 --> 00:07:49,325
Where's Seon Ok?

145
00:07:49,325 --> 00:07:51,695
She's next to me. We're eating snacks.

146
00:07:51,955 --> 00:07:52,955
Have you eaten?

147
00:07:53,395 --> 00:07:54,855
Have you talked to your boyfriend?

148
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:58,125
No, I haven't. He's in training.

149
00:07:58,495 --> 00:08:00,595
What? Joon Hyung is in training?

150
00:08:05,895 --> 00:08:06,995
What happened?

151
00:08:07,055 --> 00:08:09,995
Where did Joon Hyung go after lying to Bok Joo?

152
00:08:10,055 --> 00:08:12,755
I have no idea. He said he had to go somewhere.

153
00:08:12,755 --> 00:08:15,955
What is Joon Hyung up to these days?

154
00:08:15,955 --> 00:08:18,625
Do you also suspect that he's with another woman?

155
00:08:18,995 --> 00:08:22,155
I don't want to suspect him, but that's the feeling I get.

156
00:08:22,695 --> 00:08:24,155
What else could it be other than women?

157
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,655
Listen, Joon Hyung tends to have...

158
00:08:26,655 --> 00:08:28,555
many women around him,

159
00:08:28,555 --> 00:08:30,555
but he's not the type to betray.

160
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,295
How do you know that?

161
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,725
As a man, I can't guarantee it.

162
00:08:34,995 --> 00:08:36,025
Forget it.

163
00:08:36,595 --> 00:08:38,355
We need evidence to catch him...

164
00:08:38,355 --> 00:08:40,725
or to straighten out any misunderstanding.

165
00:08:41,265 --> 00:08:44,655
Tae Kwon, we need your cooperation.

166
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:49,525
Hey.

167
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:51,625
My niece's future husband.

168
00:08:52,855 --> 00:08:54,955
I'm not sure if I can ask this,

169
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,955
but can you come for two hours tomorrow?

170
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,225
My girlfriend is very upset right now.

171
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:01,655
Okay, I will.

172
00:09:02,195 --> 00:09:04,155
I'll come after my training.

173
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:10,725
Could you let me go?

174
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:17,155
- Hello, Honey? 
- Aren't you coming?

175
00:09:17,425 --> 00:09:20,495
- Where are you, you jerk? 
- Why are you cursing at me?

176
00:09:20,765 --> 00:09:22,265
You're the most beautiful when you curse.

177
00:09:22,425 --> 00:09:25,655
- Keep up with the compliments. 
- You're so cool.

178
00:09:26,955 --> 00:09:27,995
Why aren't you answering me?

179
00:09:28,395 --> 00:09:30,295
Who are you with? Which girl?

180
00:09:30,895 --> 00:09:32,325
Aren't you going to answer me?

181
00:09:33,095 --> 00:09:35,225
The number you have dialed...

182
00:09:35,555 --> 00:09:37,055
She's not picking up.

183
00:09:37,855 --> 00:09:39,125
Is she in training?

184
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,325
Why did she call me at that moment?

185
00:09:42,725 --> 00:09:45,895
I want to hear your voice, Bok Joo.

186
00:09:46,355 --> 00:09:47,425
Joon Hyung.

187
00:09:48,995 --> 00:09:51,765
Look who it is. It's Si Ho.

188
00:09:52,955 --> 00:09:55,265
- Have you been well? 
- I've been okay.

189
00:09:55,765 --> 00:09:57,395
Gosh, where are you going?

190
00:09:57,595 --> 00:09:58,955
I'm heading to the dorm, and you?

191
00:09:59,095 --> 00:10:00,765
I'm heading there, too. Let's go together.

192
00:10:01,155 --> 00:10:02,855
- Go ahead first. 
- Let's go together.

193
00:10:03,195 --> 00:10:04,265
No, go ahead first.

194
00:10:04,265 --> 00:10:06,625
Stop playing. Let's go.

195
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:07,725
Okay, let's go.

196
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,495
How's the therapy session?

197
00:10:13,925 --> 00:10:16,265
- Isn't the doctor great? 
- Yes.

198
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:19,695
I've been feeling much better ever since the therapy.

199
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,855
I'm studying these days.

200
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:24,195
I'm being interviewed for assistant coach positions.

201
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:26,925
You're working hard.

202
00:10:27,655 --> 00:10:29,495
You look much better, too.

203
00:10:29,955 --> 00:10:31,025
Really?

204
00:10:31,995 --> 00:10:34,195
By the way, are you in touch with Bok Joo often?

205
00:10:35,425 --> 00:10:38,055
Isn't it difficult because she's in Taereung?

206
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:42,155
I'm starting to resent the national team.

207
00:10:58,395 --> 00:11:01,125
(Haneol Sport University)

208
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:12,395
What?

209
00:11:13,355 --> 00:11:15,125
Gosh, see you there.

210
00:11:16,055 --> 00:11:17,825
Nan Hee, we've got one.

211
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:19,555
Joon Hyung is out again.

212
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:21,695
We have to go now.

213
00:11:21,695 --> 00:11:23,995
Okay, Joon Hyung is dead meat.

214
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:25,525
Let's go.

215
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:36,255
He's walking so fast. He must be excited.

216
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:38,255
I hope he's not seeing another woman.

217
00:11:38,425 --> 00:11:39,925
If so, I'll grab him by the collar.

218
00:11:40,055 --> 00:11:41,855
It has to be another woman.

219
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:43,625
I'm sure of it.

220
00:11:44,025 --> 00:11:46,425
I thought he was more faithful than that.

221
00:11:46,755 --> 00:11:48,755
- I'm nothing without my fidelity. 
- Be quiet.

222
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:50,825
We must catch him in the act,

223
00:11:50,825 --> 00:11:52,595
so be discreet as possible.

224
00:12:06,495 --> 00:12:07,495
Over there.

225
00:12:08,655 --> 00:12:09,725
Let's go.

226
00:12:28,025 --> 00:12:29,355
Is he visiting someone at the hospital?

227
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,195
Perhaps.

228
00:12:31,955 --> 00:12:33,795
Is the woman hospitalized?

229
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:35,825
Could it be...

230
00:12:36,695 --> 00:12:37,755
a nurse?

231
00:12:42,055 --> 00:12:44,755
We can't go into someone's room in the hospital.

232
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:47,925
We must catch him in the act of cheating.

233
00:12:48,195 --> 00:12:51,155
Kim Chang Geol? The name sounds familiar.

234
00:12:51,295 --> 00:12:52,795
Do you know Kim Chang Geol?

235
00:12:53,525 --> 00:12:55,125
Kim Chang Geol?

236
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,855
It's the same as the name of Bok Joo's father.

237
00:12:58,855 --> 00:13:00,755
Right, her father's name is...

238
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,655
No, that can't be.

239
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:08,025
What? What do you think it is?

240
00:13:09,595 --> 00:13:11,525
- Gosh, these are delicious. 
- Aren't they?

241
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:15,095
Nan Hee, Seon Ok.

242
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,155
How did you know I was here?

243
00:13:17,425 --> 00:13:19,225
- Mr. Kim. 
- Mr. Kim.

244
00:13:19,495 --> 00:13:21,025
- Mr. Kim? 
- Hey.

245
00:13:34,425 --> 00:13:36,425
I can't believe you guys the more I think about it.

246
00:13:37,255 --> 00:13:38,995
- Especially you, Tae Kwon. 
- Yes?

247
00:13:39,295 --> 00:13:41,955
Are you friends with me or with them?

248
00:13:42,325 --> 00:13:44,755
How could you suspect me and spy on me?

249
00:13:44,995 --> 00:13:46,895
I didn't have a choice.

250
00:13:46,895 --> 00:13:49,295
He didn't do anything wrong. It's us who overreacted.

251
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:53,295
Bok Joo was sad that she couldn't get a hold of you,

252
00:13:53,295 --> 00:13:54,955
so I lost my temper.

253
00:13:56,155 --> 00:13:59,195
I'm sorry for being thoughtless. It's because we're her friends.

254
00:13:59,195 --> 00:14:02,195
I'm sorry for overreacting.

255
00:14:04,295 --> 00:14:07,555
I understand. Just make sure you keep it a secret from Bok Joo.

256
00:14:08,925 --> 00:14:10,695
I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing,

257
00:14:10,695 --> 00:14:12,825
but this is what her father wants.

258
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,455
It's right to respect his wish.

259
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:15,825
Okay, I got it.

260
00:14:15,995 --> 00:14:17,495
Don't worry. We won't tell.

261
00:14:21,255 --> 00:14:23,225
I won't see Bok Joo anyway.

262
00:14:29,725 --> 00:14:31,755
Our friendship is over after this year.

263
00:14:32,495 --> 00:14:33,555
I love you, Joon Hyung.

264
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:52,295
Gosh, why is it so difficult to get a hold of you?

265
00:14:53,055 --> 00:14:55,625
I'm sorry. We kept missing each other.

266
00:14:56,955 --> 00:14:58,825
- Where are you? 
- I'm at the gym.

267
00:14:59,255 --> 00:15:00,595
Are you in the dormitory?

268
00:15:01,555 --> 00:15:02,995
Are you training a lot these days?

269
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:06,025
You seem busier than me even though I'm in Taereung.

270
00:15:06,595 --> 00:15:08,555
I'm busy with training.

271
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,925
Lately, I've been busy with many things.

272
00:15:12,555 --> 00:15:13,725
Many things? Like what?

273
00:15:14,655 --> 00:15:15,655
What?

274
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,095
I'm just saying.

275
00:15:19,755 --> 00:15:21,025
Why would I be busy?

276
00:15:22,925 --> 00:15:24,195
You're so wishy-washy.

277
00:15:25,195 --> 00:15:27,595
Is it because you don't like me?

278
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,495
Bok Joo, come here for a minute.

279
00:15:32,055 --> 00:15:34,855
Okay, someone is calling me. I'll call you later.

280
00:15:36,595 --> 00:15:37,825
Bok Joo.

281
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,325
(Chubs)

282
00:15:40,825 --> 00:15:42,455
We only talked for a minute.

283
00:15:43,925 --> 00:15:46,555
I miss you more after hearing your voice.

284
00:15:54,425 --> 00:15:56,955
I miss you, Bok Joo.

285
00:15:57,825 --> 00:16:00,995
I miss you like crazy, Bok Joo.

286
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:27,055
Let's focus.

287
00:16:27,555 --> 00:16:29,195
The competition is coming up. Let's focus.

288
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,255
What's wrong, Bok Joo? Is your back okay?

289
00:16:46,695 --> 00:16:48,395
I think I hurt my back.

290
00:16:48,555 --> 00:16:50,725
Your back keeps getting in the way.

291
00:16:50,895 --> 00:16:52,055
Your competition is coming up soon.

292
00:16:52,725 --> 00:16:53,755
Let me see it.

293
00:16:55,325 --> 00:16:57,925
- Does it hurt? 
- It's okay, I can endure the pain.

294
00:16:57,925 --> 00:16:59,625
No, it's not good.

295
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:01,255
You can't continue like this.

296
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:03,525
It's better that you get treated first.

297
00:17:04,225 --> 00:17:07,195
There's a placed called Dr. Park's Hospital.

298
00:17:07,395 --> 00:17:10,255
They specialize in injuries for athletes, so go there for treatment.

299
00:17:10,755 --> 00:17:12,855
Get some rest at home, and come back tomorrow.

300
00:17:13,055 --> 00:17:14,555
I give you my permission.

301
00:17:14,895 --> 00:17:17,255
- Are you being serious? 
- Yes.

302
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,895
You need to change and get in better shape.

303
00:17:19,895 --> 00:17:21,125
You can't compete with your back like this.

304
00:17:21,855 --> 00:17:24,195
Thank you, I'll go get treated.

305
00:17:24,755 --> 00:17:26,925
It must go straight up.

306
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,355
There it is.

307
00:17:29,295 --> 00:17:30,925
It was a success.

308
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,655
Is it Tae Kwon?

309
00:17:33,325 --> 00:17:34,525
What's up, Tae Kwon?

310
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:38,395
- What are you doing? 
- I'm watching competition videos.

311
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:40,095
What is it?

312
00:17:40,555 --> 00:17:42,255
I'm not working today.

313
00:17:43,725 --> 00:17:46,155
Do you want to see a movie with me?

314
00:17:46,255 --> 00:17:47,465
A movie sounds good.

315
00:17:47,465 --> 00:17:49,855
Just a moment. I'll ask Nan Hee when she's back from...

316
00:17:49,855 --> 00:17:51,225
Well, don't ask her.

317
00:17:52,255 --> 00:17:53,325
Let's go without her.

318
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:55,655
I want to go with you.

319
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:08,495
Are you surprised that I asked you out for a movie?

320
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:11,525
No.

321
00:18:11,795 --> 00:18:14,495
I think I'm more surprised that you're talking to me casually now.

322
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,655
Then shall I go back to talking politely?

323
00:18:18,195 --> 00:18:19,695
You don't need to do that.

324
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:21,425
I'm sure I'll get used to it soon.

325
00:18:29,895 --> 00:18:31,255
- Hey, guys! 
- Gosh.

326
00:18:31,255 --> 00:18:34,465
Where were you, Nan Hee? My gosh.

327
00:18:34,465 --> 00:18:37,255
- Hi, Nan Hee. 
- Where are you guys going?

328
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:41,755
- Well, we were... 
- We were waiting for you here...

329
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:43,295
to go to the movies with you.

330
00:18:43,295 --> 00:18:45,155
- Yes, that's right. 
- Really?

331
00:18:45,155 --> 00:18:47,195
My gosh, I love movies.

332
00:18:47,195 --> 00:18:50,425
Is this the first official outing of the three of us? I'm so excited.

333
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:54,155
Which movie? There's something I've wanted to watch.

334
00:18:56,195 --> 00:18:59,055
Nan Hee loves movies.

335
00:19:00,825 --> 00:19:02,925
- Thank you. 
- You're welcome.

336
00:19:08,155 --> 00:19:10,625
This doctor is really good. The tension is gone.

337
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,295
Nice. I'm free from the pain now.

338
00:19:14,155 --> 00:19:15,355
Would Joon Hyung be done now?

339
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,925
I should go home first.

340
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:24,655
Then I should call Dad.

341
00:19:31,695 --> 00:19:32,725
Hey, Bok Joo.

342
00:19:35,325 --> 00:19:36,325
Hi, Uncle. Where's Dad?

343
00:19:36,895 --> 00:19:39,495
Oh, well... He's in the bathroom.

344
00:19:39,495 --> 00:19:41,355
I think he has diarrhea or something.

345
00:19:41,825 --> 00:19:44,125
Really? What did he eat?

346
00:19:44,525 --> 00:19:47,295
Uncle, I got a day off to get treatment for my lower back.

347
00:19:47,295 --> 00:19:49,095
If I take a taxi, I can be home in 20 minutes.

348
00:19:51,095 --> 00:19:53,295
What did you just say? You're coming home now?

349
00:19:56,355 --> 00:19:59,795
Okay. All right, Bok Joo. I left something on the stove.

350
00:19:59,795 --> 00:20:01,655
Yes, okay. I have to go. Bye.

351
00:20:04,555 --> 00:20:06,525
What should we do? She's on her way home now.

352
00:20:06,525 --> 00:20:09,395
- What if she sees the sign? 
- We have no choice.

353
00:20:09,395 --> 00:20:12,195
- We should go home now. 
- You'll hurt yourself.

354
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:13,655
We're already doomed.

355
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:17,295
She'll be there in 20 minutes. It'll take at least an hour for us.

356
00:20:17,295 --> 00:20:19,655
What should we do, then? If she finds out,

357
00:20:19,655 --> 00:20:21,465
she'll cry her eyes out and go crazy.

358
00:20:21,465 --> 00:20:24,325
Hold on. Let's calm down and try to collect our thoughts.

359
00:20:25,155 --> 00:20:27,895
We have to stop her from going home, right?

360
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,725
- What about her friends? 
- Right, her friends.

361
00:20:30,725 --> 00:20:33,555
- Shall I ask them to snatch her? 
- Yes, call them now.

362
00:20:34,325 --> 00:20:37,195
- You should use your phone. 
- Oh, right. My phone is here.

363
00:20:38,055 --> 00:20:40,495
The seizure procedure has begun. I used to be...

364
00:20:41,555 --> 00:20:42,995
a prosecutor in the special crimes unit.

365
00:20:43,695 --> 00:20:46,355
The unit is still filled with my junior colleagues.

366
00:20:47,695 --> 00:20:48,695
Please trust me...

367
00:20:49,555 --> 00:20:52,125
and sign this power of attorney.

368
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:54,395
I promise you that you will...

369
00:20:55,525 --> 00:20:56,555
get your money back.

370
00:21:03,925 --> 00:21:05,295
It's so funny.

371
00:21:08,325 --> 00:21:10,925
- I heard they're on bad terms. 
- Then...

372
00:21:18,095 --> 00:21:19,155
That's way too light.

373
00:21:35,155 --> 00:21:36,355
Hi, Mr. Kim.

374
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:38,655
I'm at the gym now. What's up?

375
00:21:40,225 --> 00:21:41,225
Sorry?

376
00:21:41,895 --> 00:21:42,925
Bok Joo?

377
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:47,055
Gosh. My home sweet home, Bok Chicken!

378
00:21:47,465 --> 00:21:49,755
Kim Bok Joo is back. I'm home.

379
00:21:49,755 --> 00:21:52,725
Bok Joo! Bok Joo, Bok Joo!

380
00:21:53,655 --> 00:21:54,695
Joon Hyung!

381
00:21:58,695 --> 00:22:01,025
- How did you know that I'm here? 
- What?

382
00:22:02,295 --> 00:22:05,095
I didn't know. I was coming here to eat fried chicken...

383
00:22:05,095 --> 00:22:06,225
and saw you.

384
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:09,995
This must be what people call telepathy.

385
00:22:10,255 --> 00:22:12,595
We must be really meant to be.

386
00:22:13,225 --> 00:22:15,555
It is pretty cool. Let's go in together.

387
00:22:15,755 --> 00:22:17,925
Hey! Bok Joo.

388
00:22:17,925 --> 00:22:19,795
I missed you so much.

389
00:22:19,795 --> 00:22:20,855
What's the matter with you?

390
00:22:22,355 --> 00:22:25,255
Hey, did you do something wrong?

391
00:22:25,255 --> 00:22:26,655
Is that why you're overreacting like this?

392
00:22:27,355 --> 00:22:29,855
What are you talking about? I just missed you too much.

393
00:22:31,155 --> 00:22:34,455
Hey, let's go. We should go eat something delicious.

394
00:22:35,055 --> 00:22:36,595
How about we go for barbecue?

395
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:39,295
Okay. I'll go in and say hi to my dad before we go.

396
00:22:39,295 --> 00:22:41,755
Hey! You can do that later.

397
00:22:41,755 --> 00:22:44,725
I'm starving right now. Let's go eat meat. It's on me.

398
00:22:44,925 --> 00:22:45,925
Turn around!

399
00:22:46,995 --> 00:22:47,995
Go.

400
00:22:49,395 --> 00:22:50,425
Hurry up now.

401
00:22:59,455 --> 00:23:02,825
I'm not sure why I have to eat fried chicken here,

402
00:23:02,825 --> 00:23:06,295
but I guess knowing my enemy isn't a bad thing. Let's eat.

403
00:23:06,655 --> 00:23:08,125
Yes, exactly. Eat up.

404
00:23:09,395 --> 00:23:11,395
It looks like you've lost a bit of weight.

405
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:14,525
- I've gained weight. 
- I haven't seen you in so long.

406
00:23:15,655 --> 00:23:17,195
How have you been, Chubs?

407
00:23:17,495 --> 00:23:18,795
You're asking that just now?

408
00:23:19,555 --> 00:23:22,195
- I've been great. Are we good now? 
- Do you have to talk like that?

409
00:23:22,195 --> 00:23:24,295
You haven't seen your darling here in such a long time.

410
00:23:24,395 --> 00:23:25,525
My darling? Whatever.

411
00:23:27,425 --> 00:23:29,855
Hey, be honest with me.

412
00:23:29,855 --> 00:23:31,155
What are you up to these days?

413
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:34,425
Have you been partying like crazy and hanging out with girls?

414
00:23:34,425 --> 00:23:37,295
Do you think I'm crazy? I know that I'll die in your hands if I do that.

415
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,555
- So you didn't do that? 
- Of course not.

416
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,495
I have to go to the washroom.

417
00:24:11,995 --> 00:24:13,255
Hello? Go ahead.

418
00:24:13,695 --> 00:24:15,225
Hey, what's going on? Are you with Bok Joo?

419
00:24:16,195 --> 00:24:18,925
I'm making sure she can't go anywhere. Don't worry.

420
00:24:19,095 --> 00:24:21,325
My gosh. Thanks so much, Joon Hyung.

421
00:24:21,325 --> 00:24:24,425
I think we'll be home in about 20 minutes.

422
00:24:24,425 --> 00:24:26,695
Stall her for another 30 minutes, okay?

423
00:24:27,225 --> 00:24:28,995
Okay, I will. Please don't worry.

424
00:24:28,995 --> 00:24:31,095
I'll do my best to keep Bok Joo here. Yes.

425
00:24:32,225 --> 00:24:33,255
Thank you.

426
00:24:36,495 --> 00:24:40,195
Yes. I should go. All right.

427
00:24:42,825 --> 00:24:45,495
Weren't you going to the washroom? Why are you taking a call here?

428
00:24:46,255 --> 00:24:48,355
Well... I was feeling a little claustrophobic,

429
00:24:48,355 --> 00:24:50,025
so I wanted to get some fresh air.

430
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:54,795
- Who called you? 
- What? It's someone you don't know.

431
00:24:55,825 --> 00:24:58,095
Hey, let's go eat. The chicken will get cold.

432
00:24:58,095 --> 00:24:59,125
Come on. Let's go.

433
00:25:00,825 --> 00:25:01,855
Goodness.

434
00:25:03,825 --> 00:25:05,655
Who was it? Why can't you tell me?

435
00:25:05,655 --> 00:25:09,155
It's not that I can't tell you. It's just someone you don't know.

436
00:25:09,155 --> 00:25:12,225
So who is it? I'm sure that person has a name. Tell me.

437
00:25:12,225 --> 00:25:13,955
Well... You don't know him.

438
00:25:14,855 --> 00:25:17,825
Seung... His name is Seung Jin. He's my friend from high school.

439
00:25:18,955 --> 00:25:21,855
Friend? Do you usually talk that politely to your friends?

440
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:23,625
You must have huge respect for him.

441
00:25:24,255 --> 00:25:27,295
Hey, when did I talk like that?

442
00:25:27,595 --> 00:25:29,355
You misheard me.

443
00:25:29,825 --> 00:25:32,895
We haven't seen each other forever. Why are you trying to pick a fight?

444
00:25:32,895 --> 00:25:35,525
It wasn't a friend, right? I'm sure it was a girl.

445
00:25:36,055 --> 00:25:39,725
What are you talking about? Why are you so suspicious of me?

446
00:25:39,725 --> 00:25:41,595
It's because you're acting suspiciously!

447
00:25:42,225 --> 00:25:43,655
Give me your phone. Show me his name.

448
00:25:43,955 --> 00:25:45,225
What are you doing now?

449
00:25:45,225 --> 00:25:47,955
Goodness gracious. How dare you glare at me.

450
00:25:47,955 --> 00:25:50,925
What you're doing is only increasing my suspicion. Give it to me.

451
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:53,525
- Stop it. I don't want to. 
- You said you did nothing wrong.

452
00:25:53,525 --> 00:25:54,655
Show me his name. Give it to me.

453
00:25:54,655 --> 00:25:56,725
What is wrong with you? Do you not trust me?

454
00:25:59,995 --> 00:26:01,895
Okay. I was out of line.

455
00:26:01,995 --> 00:26:05,425
I've been on edge because of my training. Let's not fight.

456
00:26:09,155 --> 00:26:12,325
Yes. Why are you suspicious of me?

457
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:15,755
I haven't even looked at other girls. Never.

458
00:26:15,755 --> 00:26:16,795
Trust me.

459
00:26:21,395 --> 00:26:23,725
Hey. Hey! Give it back.

460
00:26:23,725 --> 00:26:26,195
- Who is this person? 
- Hey, give it back to me now.

461
00:26:29,095 --> 00:26:30,125
Hey, stop.

462
00:26:30,925 --> 00:26:31,955
Give it back!

463
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:33,955
Give it back to me, seriously.

464
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:39,295
I know that we're dating, but we must respect each other's privacy.

465
00:26:39,295 --> 00:26:40,795
Going through your boyfriend's phone...

466
00:26:42,025 --> 00:26:43,295
is such a mannerless thing to do.

467
00:26:43,495 --> 00:26:46,195
Privacy? Mannerless?

468
00:26:46,195 --> 00:26:48,555
My gosh! You're so intelligent.

469
00:26:48,555 --> 00:26:51,595
I don't know what privacy or manners are, so I'll just leave you alone.

470
00:26:51,595 --> 00:26:53,825
Have fun with your new girlfriend. Bye!

471
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:56,355
Hey, wait. Hey!

472
00:26:59,055 --> 00:27:00,125
Bok Joo.

473
00:27:00,595 --> 00:27:02,155
Oh, I have to pay.

474
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:03,795
Hey, Bok Joo. Wait up!

475
00:27:04,425 --> 00:27:06,695
What is the matter with you? It's nothing to get angry about.

476
00:27:06,695 --> 00:27:09,295
Right. I'm getting worked up over nothing, aren't I?

477
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:12,325
I'm overreacting, and I have trust issues. Let's say it's all my fault!

478
00:27:12,695 --> 00:27:14,925
Hey, why are you talking like that?

479
00:27:15,595 --> 00:27:17,425
We haven't seen each other forever. Let's make up.

480
00:27:17,425 --> 00:27:20,025
Right. I didn't want to be like this as I haven't seen you in so long,

481
00:27:20,025 --> 00:27:21,655
but I can't stop feeling angry.

482
00:27:21,655 --> 00:27:24,055
My lower back is killing me, but I was still so excited...

483
00:27:24,055 --> 00:27:26,025
to see you and Dad. I was such an idiot!

484
00:27:26,495 --> 00:27:28,655
I really didn't think you'd do this to me.

485
00:27:29,025 --> 00:27:30,595
Hey, Kim Bok Joo.

486
00:27:32,755 --> 00:27:34,825
Gosh, I can't even tell her the truth.

487
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,755
Has it been 30 minutes? Goodness.

488
00:27:41,095 --> 00:27:42,925
He doesn't love me as much anymore. What a jerk.

489
00:27:43,325 --> 00:27:45,655
He used to be so sweet to me.

490
00:27:45,655 --> 00:27:46,755
We weren't even apart for that long.

491
00:27:47,495 --> 00:27:51,095
Fine. The world is wide, and there're many pretty girls.

492
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:53,225
What a jerk.

493
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:56,825
(Bok Chicken)

494
00:27:57,055 --> 00:27:59,095
Dad. Uncle.

495
00:28:05,895 --> 00:28:07,925
- What are you doing, Uncle? 
- What?

496
00:28:08,955 --> 00:28:10,825
Hey, Bok Joo. You're here.

497
00:28:12,055 --> 00:28:15,155
Is your back okay now? Did you get it treated?

498
00:28:15,255 --> 00:28:17,555
I went to the hospital the coach told me about. I feel much better.

499
00:28:18,225 --> 00:28:20,095
Why are you wearing a mask? Did you catch a cold?

500
00:28:21,495 --> 00:28:24,055
I might give it to the customers. It's just a prevention.

501
00:28:24,055 --> 00:28:27,225
Be careful, Dad. They say the flu this winter is really bad.

502
00:28:29,225 --> 00:28:31,095
Why are you sweating so much, Uncle?

503
00:28:31,095 --> 00:28:32,155
Did you go somewhere?

504
00:28:32,325 --> 00:28:35,695
Well... I think I've become poor in health.

505
00:28:35,695 --> 00:28:37,625
I sweat so much these days.

506
00:28:38,025 --> 00:28:39,725
I guess my male menopause started early.

507
00:28:40,195 --> 00:28:42,025
You should get married soon.

508
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:43,725
Uncle.

509
00:28:44,425 --> 00:28:46,825
- What are you doing? 
- It's a prevention.

510
00:28:46,995 --> 00:28:48,695
Why are you cleaning the fire extinguisher?

511
00:28:49,425 --> 00:28:50,425
To prevent fire.

512
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:52,125
- Bok Joo! 
- Bok Joo!

513
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:54,995
What are you doing here, guys? Did you know I was here?

514
00:28:55,455 --> 00:28:58,625
- What's going on? 
- We just came to eat chicken,

515
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,225
and we heard your voice.

516
00:29:00,955 --> 00:29:03,755
We just have telepathic connections, don't we?

517
00:29:03,925 --> 00:29:05,655
- We're awesome. 
- Awesome.

518
00:29:05,825 --> 00:29:07,055
All right.

519
00:29:08,095 --> 00:29:09,995
Why is everyone keep talking about telepathy?

520
00:29:09,995 --> 00:29:12,195
Bok Joo, I missed you.

521
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:14,525
- Did you? 
- Welcome back.

522
00:29:14,525 --> 00:29:16,055
You eat chicken without me now.

523
00:29:25,795 --> 00:29:28,425
Dr. Go. He's late today.

524
00:29:28,695 --> 00:29:29,895
Maybe he's busy.

525
00:29:30,195 --> 00:29:32,595
Well... I'm not waiting for him.

526
00:29:33,255 --> 00:29:34,455
I didn't say you were.

527
00:29:35,055 --> 00:29:36,455
Should we go home first?

528
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,125
Of course. I'm going to go home soon, too.

529
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,455
- I just want to see some documents. 
- Okay.

530
00:29:53,795 --> 00:29:54,825
Ah Young.

531
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:01,925
I'm sorry.

532
00:30:02,155 --> 00:30:03,825
A seminar suddenly came up.

533
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:05,925
I came as soon as it ended,

534
00:30:06,695 --> 00:30:07,725
but I'm a little late.

535
00:30:08,925 --> 00:30:10,795
I didn't want to keep you waiting, so I drove really fast.

536
00:30:11,725 --> 00:30:13,095
I wasn't waiting for you.

537
00:30:14,025 --> 00:30:16,895
- I just had many patients today. 
- Is that so?

538
00:30:18,255 --> 00:30:19,455
I guess I was happy over nothing.

539
00:30:21,325 --> 00:30:22,325
Have you eaten?

540
00:30:22,325 --> 00:30:24,555
Of course. I had dinner with the nurses.

541
00:30:24,555 --> 00:30:25,655
It's late.

542
00:30:26,055 --> 00:30:28,025
You're still going to eat with me, right?

543
00:30:29,095 --> 00:30:30,155
I rushed all the way here.

544
00:30:31,155 --> 00:30:32,195
All right.

545
00:30:32,825 --> 00:30:36,025
You did come all the way here. I can't really tell you to go back.

546
00:30:37,225 --> 00:30:38,295
Let's go, then.

547
00:30:56,825 --> 00:30:58,895
Here. Eat up.

548
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,225
They make delicious food here.

549
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:04,595
I couldn't finish my dinner because I got a patient.

550
00:31:05,855 --> 00:31:06,925
I know.

551
00:31:07,425 --> 00:31:08,955
Eat up. I didn't say anything.

552
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:15,025
By the way, I think we've been to almost every restaurant here.

553
00:31:15,825 --> 00:31:16,825
Well...

554
00:31:17,325 --> 00:31:18,895
I guess you're right.

555
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:21,755
I wanted to buy you something more delicious,

556
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,425
but I don't know this neighborhood well.

557
00:31:23,695 --> 00:31:26,455
So I looked up the good restaurants near here on the internet.

558
00:31:26,955 --> 00:31:28,095
There is...

559
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:30,925
a very famous place that makes squid and pork bulgogi.

560
00:31:31,695 --> 00:31:34,355
Also, there is a popular samgyetang restaurant in the suburb.

561
00:31:34,795 --> 00:31:35,855
The drumsticks look good.

562
00:31:37,555 --> 00:31:40,055
And we can go to eat rice with wraps, too. You like that, right?

563
00:31:40,825 --> 00:31:42,855
Gosh. Look at these pictures.

564
00:31:42,855 --> 00:31:44,125
Look. What do you think?

565
00:31:44,225 --> 00:31:46,455
Do you want to go to eat it next time?

566
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:51,655
I should go.

567
00:31:53,025 --> 00:31:55,155
I have some more work to do. You should stay and eat.

568
00:31:58,995 --> 00:31:59,995
Ah Young.

569
00:32:01,555 --> 00:32:03,255
Ah Young. Hang on.

570
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:06,425
Here you go.

571
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:07,555
- Please keep the change. 
- Thank you.

572
00:32:07,555 --> 00:32:08,555
Ah Young!

573
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:10,755
Ah Young. What's wrong?

574
00:32:12,195 --> 00:32:13,295
Did I make a mistake again?

575
00:32:14,395 --> 00:32:16,395
Yes. You did.

576
00:32:16,995 --> 00:32:19,825
I moved here to avoid you. I wanted to be away from you.

577
00:32:20,725 --> 00:32:21,725
These days,

578
00:32:22,325 --> 00:32:24,595
I find myself waiting for you every evening.

579
00:32:25,495 --> 00:32:28,195
I feel like I'm developing a crush on you all over again.

580
00:32:29,525 --> 00:32:31,095
It scares me so much. I hate it.

581
00:32:32,455 --> 00:32:33,725
So don't come out here again.

582
00:32:34,825 --> 00:32:36,255
I won't eat with you anymore.

583
00:32:44,325 --> 00:32:45,455
I hate Seoul without you in it.

584
00:32:47,155 --> 00:32:48,355
It's too lonely.

585
00:32:51,355 --> 00:32:52,725
So don't tell me not to come.

586
00:33:00,025 --> 00:33:01,055
What did you...

587
00:33:01,395 --> 00:33:03,755
mean by the things you just said?

588
00:33:07,255 --> 00:33:08,255
Do you...

589
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:10,195
like Messi?

590
00:33:16,055 --> 00:33:19,055
That's a bad way to propose to someone.

591
00:33:20,455 --> 00:33:21,495
I know.

592
00:33:51,595 --> 00:33:52,895
No, not that.

593
00:33:54,555 --> 00:33:56,095
My goodness. Here.

594
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:57,725
Get it yourself.

595
00:33:57,725 --> 00:34:00,255
- You're so lazy. 
- Just eat this.

596
00:34:01,725 --> 00:34:03,155
- I can't reach it. 
- Gosh.

597
00:34:06,555 --> 00:34:08,225
Who is it? Why aren't you answering?

598
00:34:08,725 --> 00:34:10,555
Who is it? Isn't that Joon Hyung?

599
00:34:10,865 --> 00:34:13,395
- Why aren't you answering? 
- Whatever. I hate him.

600
00:34:13,755 --> 00:34:15,895
What's wrong? You two were madly in love.

601
00:34:15,995 --> 00:34:17,455
Are you fed up with him already?

602
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:20,295
I don't know. I guess men are all the same.

603
00:34:20,655 --> 00:34:24,055
If you don't keep them on a tight leash, they start getting ideas.

604
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:28,195
(Bok Chicken)

605
00:34:32,865 --> 00:34:34,695
Gosh. It looks like she's really mad at me.

606
00:34:35,755 --> 00:34:37,655
We don't have much time to be with each other.

607
00:34:37,655 --> 00:34:39,695
Please pick up already, Bok Joo.

608
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:41,825
The person you're trying to reach is not available.

609
00:34:43,195 --> 00:34:46,455
(Bok Chicken)

610
00:34:58,895 --> 00:35:00,125
What are you doing here?

611
00:35:01,995 --> 00:35:03,155
Hello, Sir.

612
00:35:07,395 --> 00:35:09,455
Why were you waiting outside in the cold?

613
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,595
If she didn't pick up,

614
00:35:12,155 --> 00:35:13,195
you should've gone home.

615
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,255
Thank you for the drink.

616
00:35:20,825 --> 00:35:22,255
Are you feeling okay?

617
00:35:22,425 --> 00:35:25,125
Of course. It's not like I'm dying.

618
00:35:26,755 --> 00:35:29,365
Why is Bok Joo mad at you? What did you do?

619
00:35:29,825 --> 00:35:32,925
I didn't do anything. She just misunderstood about something.

620
00:35:33,595 --> 00:35:35,325
- It's nothing big. 
- Is that right?

621
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:39,155
Anyway, thank you for helping me today.

622
00:35:41,155 --> 00:35:42,895
- Did you say you are a swimmer? 
- Yes.

623
00:35:43,195 --> 00:35:44,195
How good are you?

624
00:35:44,525 --> 00:35:46,425
I won the second place at the last national games.

625
00:35:48,225 --> 00:35:49,695
You should've won the first place.

626
00:35:51,055 --> 00:35:53,425
Do you have both of your parents?

627
00:35:53,725 --> 00:35:54,755
Yes.

628
00:35:55,055 --> 00:35:57,095
They run a pharmacy together.

629
00:36:00,195 --> 00:36:01,755
They're actually my aunt and uncle.

630
00:36:02,455 --> 00:36:05,595
My dad died when I was little, and my mom got remarried,

631
00:36:07,455 --> 00:36:09,055
so I grew up in my uncle's house.

632
00:36:11,055 --> 00:36:12,795
But I've been well-loved by them.

633
00:36:13,055 --> 00:36:14,695
I never felt like anything was missing.

634
00:36:16,825 --> 00:36:19,325
I've never seen someone who says he's been well-loved himself.

635
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:24,655
By the way, why do you like Bok Joo?

636
00:36:26,495 --> 00:36:27,555
She just...

637
00:36:29,525 --> 00:36:30,595
feels warm.

638
00:36:33,455 --> 00:36:35,655
When she is with her friends,

639
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:39,755
when she is with you and her uncle,

640
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:43,865
and also when she lifts weights.

641
00:36:47,555 --> 00:36:51,025
Bok Joo somehow makes your heart warm...

642
00:36:51,455 --> 00:36:52,455
since she was little.

643
00:36:53,695 --> 00:36:54,725
I guess.

644
00:36:55,795 --> 00:36:58,525
She's a very friendly person. She takes after me.

645
00:36:59,995 --> 00:37:03,125
That's right. Bok Joo is just like you.

646
00:37:05,795 --> 00:37:06,895
Don't laugh, you brat.

647
00:37:07,655 --> 00:37:08,725
I know you're lying.

648
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:11,925
You're quite cheeky, you rascal.

649
00:37:18,395 --> 00:37:19,455
My gosh.

650
00:37:21,795 --> 00:37:24,755
Bok Joo. Hurry up and go. You're on the national team now.

651
00:37:24,755 --> 00:37:26,025
I'm going.

652
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:28,325
Just go already. I hope the rest of your training goes well.

653
00:37:28,325 --> 00:37:29,725
Watch your back as well.

654
00:37:29,825 --> 00:37:31,655
I hope you'll get over your cold soon.

655
00:37:31,995 --> 00:37:33,895
Uncle, you should work harder and let him rest. Okay?

656
00:37:33,995 --> 00:37:36,325
All right. Don't worry about it and just go.

657
00:37:36,325 --> 00:37:37,725
A national athlete shouldn't be late.

658
00:37:37,725 --> 00:37:39,725
Fine. I'm going. Why are you so eager to send me away?

659
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:42,395
I'll call you. I love you. I love you.

660
00:37:42,655 --> 00:37:44,025
Okay. I'll see you later.

661
00:37:46,795 --> 00:37:48,455
- We should hurry. 
- Okay.

662
00:37:53,025 --> 00:37:55,655
(Closed due to the owner's personal reason)

663
00:37:55,655 --> 00:37:58,525
I always forget to bring my extra battery.

664
00:38:00,495 --> 00:38:03,325
What? Why is it closed?

665
00:38:05,595 --> 00:38:07,555
Where did they disappear to?

666
00:38:10,825 --> 00:38:12,655
Bok Joo, long time no see.

667
00:38:12,655 --> 00:38:15,095
- Hello. 
- Hello.

668
00:38:15,095 --> 00:38:17,865
I heard you went to Taereung. Are you visiting home?

669
00:38:19,155 --> 00:38:22,495
By the way, when is your father's surgery?

670
00:38:22,495 --> 00:38:23,895
Pardon me? His surgery?

671
00:38:33,525 --> 00:38:37,155
My gosh, it's Bok Joo again.

672
00:38:37,655 --> 00:38:38,995
Why does she keep calling me?

673
00:38:40,895 --> 00:38:42,725
My Bok Joo, did you get back safely?

674
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:45,365
Where are you right now?

675
00:38:45,895 --> 00:38:49,025
Of course I'm at the restaurant.

676
00:38:49,025 --> 00:38:51,995
Now that you've left again, it feels so empty here.

677
00:38:51,995 --> 00:38:54,225
You're at the restaurant?

678
00:38:54,455 --> 00:38:56,295
Yes, I am.

679
00:38:58,755 --> 00:38:59,995
Is this the restaurant?

680
00:39:00,825 --> 00:39:02,395
Yes, this is the restaurant.

681
00:39:03,325 --> 00:39:05,655
Your voice sounds so clear.

682
00:39:21,655 --> 00:39:24,595
I'm being honest. I was going to tell you...

683
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:27,155
after your competition.

684
00:39:28,895 --> 00:39:30,955
I told him not to tell you...

685
00:39:31,365 --> 00:39:32,955
in case you can't focus.

686
00:39:34,555 --> 00:39:36,755
It's your first international competition.

687
00:39:38,055 --> 00:39:39,595
If you ruin it because of me,

688
00:39:40,425 --> 00:39:42,895
I'd regret it all my life.

689
00:39:43,955 --> 00:39:46,195
Don't be angry, Bok Joo.

690
00:39:47,295 --> 00:39:48,655
I'm not angry.

691
00:39:51,225 --> 00:39:53,525
When I heard weakness in your voice...

692
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,955
and saw you wearing a mask, I should have noticed it.

693
00:39:58,795 --> 00:40:00,895
No matter how much I try to hide it,

694
00:40:00,895 --> 00:40:03,425
you know if I'm sick or in a bad mood.

695
00:40:04,925 --> 00:40:06,495
I'm nowhere near that.

696
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,725
That's because I'm your parent.

697
00:40:10,865 --> 00:40:11,865
Dad.

698
00:40:15,395 --> 00:40:17,125
I'll do well.

699
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:20,555
I'll win the gold medal and put it around your neck,

700
00:40:20,895 --> 00:40:23,825
so stay strong and get through the surgery, okay?

701
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:25,995
I believe in you, Dad.

702
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:28,695
Yes, believe in me.

703
00:40:30,225 --> 00:40:31,255
Just believe me.

704
00:40:34,195 --> 00:40:35,955
If you win the gold medal,

705
00:40:35,955 --> 00:40:39,365
you should treat Joon Hyung to a meal.

706
00:40:39,555 --> 00:40:41,255
He helped taking care of your dad,

707
00:40:41,255 --> 00:40:43,995
and he was with you yesterday.

708
00:40:43,995 --> 00:40:45,055
He's done a lot.

710
00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:03,595
Bok Joo, what are you doing here? Didn't you go back?

711
00:41:05,325 --> 00:41:06,725
I'm very thoughtless.

712
00:41:06,825 --> 00:41:09,455
I'm not understanding at all and self-centered.

713
00:41:09,455 --> 00:41:11,495
I don't deserve you as my boyfriend.

714
00:41:13,255 --> 00:41:15,365
What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?

715
00:41:16,995 --> 00:41:18,395
I think so.

716
00:41:18,395 --> 00:41:21,155
I believed what my senior athletes said without proof...

717
00:41:21,155 --> 00:41:23,255
while you did so much for my dad.

718
00:41:23,865 --> 00:41:25,595
Please hit me. I deserve it.

719
00:41:25,595 --> 00:41:27,295
Stop it. It will hurt.

720
00:41:29,225 --> 00:41:31,425
I tried to keep it a secret, but you found out.

721
00:41:32,095 --> 00:41:33,455
I'm really sorry.

722
00:41:34,395 --> 00:41:37,395
I'm worried because you're too handsome.

723
00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:39,895
On top of that, you're tall.

724
00:41:39,895 --> 00:41:42,255
You have a great personality that any woman would fall for.

725
00:41:44,255 --> 00:41:47,395
- What else? 
- Your hands are warm, and you...

726
00:41:47,395 --> 00:41:48,395
are good at swimming and kissing.

727
00:41:49,825 --> 00:41:52,325
- What else? 
- There's nothing more.

728
00:41:53,695 --> 00:41:56,195
How did you find out? Are things okay between you and your dad?

729
00:41:58,365 --> 00:42:01,125
Let's go before it gets late. I'll take you to Taereung.

730
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:13,195
We're already here.

731
00:42:13,195 --> 00:42:16,055
- I thought Taereung was farther. 
- I know.

732
00:42:16,055 --> 00:42:18,025
It seemed far when I traveled alone.

733
00:42:19,795 --> 00:42:21,595
Bok Joo, look at me.

734
00:42:22,595 --> 00:42:23,595
Look at me in the eyes.

735
00:42:26,025 --> 00:42:27,865
Do you see that I'm completely into you?

736
00:42:28,725 --> 00:42:32,195
Maybe in millions of years, but I won't cheat on you now.

737
00:42:32,795 --> 00:42:35,025
Don't worry and focus on your training, okay?

738
00:42:36,925 --> 00:42:38,865
Don't worry about your dad's surgery.

739
00:42:38,865 --> 00:42:42,255
I'll stay with him and do my best to take care of him...

740
00:42:42,555 --> 00:42:43,925

741
00:42:46,995 --> 00:42:47,995
Do you trust me?

742
00:42:49,365 --> 00:42:50,395
Yes, I do.

743
00:42:51,865 --> 00:42:52,925
Okay, go in.

744
00:42:53,725 --> 00:42:57,025
Concentrate only on your training, okay?

745
00:42:57,925 --> 00:43:00,495
You'd better win the gold medal. Otherwise...

746
00:43:01,395 --> 00:43:03,225
- Otherwise? 
- I'll hug you.

747
00:43:04,955 --> 00:43:07,995
Don't feel pressured. There will be another chance.

748
00:43:08,925 --> 00:43:10,925
Okay, you should leave first.

749
00:43:11,325 --> 00:43:12,725
No, you go in first.

750
00:43:13,255 --> 00:43:15,725
- Come on, you leave first. 
- No, go in first.

Go on.

Wrap roasted salt in a towel.

768

Put it on for 30 minutes twice a day.

769
00:44:37,195 --> 00:44:39,055
It's more effective than heat pads.

770
00:44:40,725 --> 00:44:43,155
Bok Joo, your dad is in good condition.

771
00:44:43,925 --> 00:44:45,525

That means she won, right?

802
00:48:14,295 --> 00:48:17,155
Yes, she'll get the gold medal.

00:53:28,155 --> 00:53:29,255
- Snatch it. 
- Gosh!

880
00:53:29,255 --> 00:53:30,625
I got her shoe!

881
00:53:32,995 --> 00:53:34,395
- Hey! 
- Get back here!

882
00:53:34,695 --> 00:53:36,125
(Danger! Keep Out)

883
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:39,255
- Guys! 
- Joon Hyung.

884
00:53:39,255 --> 00:53:41,195
- Joon Hyung. 
- Joon Hyung, come on.

885
00:53:41,195 --> 00:53:42,255
Guys, take his clothes off.

886
00:53:42,255 --> 00:53:44,495
- Take it. 
- I thought you guys were going out.

887
00:53:45,095 --> 00:53:47,155
- Lift him. 
- Wait! I'll give you guys money.

888
00:53:49,595 --> 00:53:51,225
The graduation ceremony will begin shortly.

889
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:52,725
Let's get this over with, okay?

890
00:53:57,225 --> 00:53:58,295
Salute!

891
00:53:58,695 --> 00:54:02,195
Sergeant Cho Tae Kwon is here to attend the graduation ceremony!

892
00:54:02,525 --> 00:54:05,095
- Just in time. 
- Help me, Tae Kwon!

893
00:54:05,195 --> 00:54:07,425
You wish. Let's do this, guys!

894
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:09,825
No, no. Guys, please.

895
00:54:09,825 --> 00:54:11,625
No. No! Gosh!

896
00:54:11,625 --> 00:54:13,755
- In 1, 2, 3. 
- In 1, 2, 3.

897
00:54:27,355 --> 00:54:28,425
Bok Joo!

898
00:54:29,155 --> 00:54:30,995
Oh, hello!

899
00:54:30,995 --> 00:54:32,095
- Hello. 
- Hi.

900
00:54:33,995 --> 00:54:36,055
This is Bok Joo's dad, and this is her uncle.

901
00:54:36,795 --> 00:54:37,995
- Hello. 
- Hello.

902
00:54:38,495 --> 00:54:40,225
These are Joon Hyung's parents.

903
00:54:40,225 --> 00:54:42,425
This is his brother, and she's his fiancee.

904
00:54:43,255 --> 00:54:45,395
It's such a pleasure to finally meet you. I'm Kim Chang Geol.

905
00:54:46,025 --> 00:54:49,295
Thank you for those vitamins you sent for me. They're great.

906
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:53,095
It's nothing compared to all the fried chicken you've sent.

907
00:54:53,195 --> 00:54:54,755
It's so delicious.

908
00:54:55,555 --> 00:54:56,795
You're a master of fried chicken.

909
00:54:58,755 --> 00:55:01,495
To be honest, I deep-fry 70 percent of our fried chicken.

910
00:55:01,955 --> 00:55:04,355
Please visit our restaurant. I'll close it for the day...

911
00:55:05,355 --> 00:55:07,125
and make as much fried chicken as you want.

912
00:55:08,025 --> 00:55:10,555
Then we'll give you the red ginseng drink in return.

913
00:55:10,995 --> 00:55:12,225
Please visit our pharmacy.

914
00:55:13,455 --> 00:55:15,225
It looks as if you two are getting engaged.

915
00:55:15,955 --> 00:55:16,955
Congratulations.

916
00:55:17,225 --> 00:55:18,325
You got me a gift, right?

917
00:55:19,895 --> 00:55:20,955
Congratulations, Bok Joo.

918
00:55:20,955 --> 00:55:23,025
Congratulations on setting a date for your wedding.

919
00:55:23,225 --> 00:55:25,425
- Congratulations, Dr. Go. 
- Thanks.

920
00:55:25,825 --> 00:55:28,025
You'll need to help me out if we become sisters-in-law.

921
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,695
You know how clumsy I am, right?

922
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:31,255
Gosh, stop it.

923
00:55:33,595 --> 00:55:34,655
Here, Bok Joo.

924
00:55:34,795 --> 00:55:35,825
- Thank you. 
- Joon Hyung, here.

925
00:55:37,395 --> 00:55:38,555
Dad, smell these flowers.

926
00:55:38,555 --> 00:55:40,595
- Bok Joo. 
- Bok Joo, let's take photos.

927
00:55:40,595 --> 00:55:41,925
Hello, everyone.

928
00:55:41,925 --> 00:55:45,295
I, Sergeant Cho Tae Kwon, will be your photographer today.

929
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,455
Hello, hello.

930
00:55:46,455 --> 00:55:49,025
Shall we start with Joon Hyung's family?

931
00:55:49,255 --> 00:55:51,325
All right. Please stand right there. I'll take a few photos.

932
00:55:51,525 --> 00:55:54,295
In 1, 2, 3.

933
00:56:08,195 --> 00:56:10,325
I guess I won't be able to come here after today.

934
00:56:11,325 --> 00:56:14,725
I can probably buy 100 chickens with all the change I spent here.

935
00:56:15,395 --> 00:56:17,695
Thanks to it, you achieved all of your dreams.

936
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,455
I mean, you joined the national team and even got a boyfriend.

937
00:56:21,555 --> 00:56:22,555
A handsome boyfriend.

938
00:56:23,655 --> 00:56:24,655
What are you saying?

939
00:56:25,455 --> 00:56:26,525
You don't think I'm handsome?

940
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:29,795
Fine. I'll give it to you as your graduation gift. You're handsome.

941
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:38,555
So many things happened on this campus in the last four years.

942
00:56:39,795 --> 00:56:41,955
I trained hard...

943
00:56:42,325 --> 00:56:45,455
and ate a lot with Nan Hee and Seon Ok.

944
00:56:46,155 --> 00:56:47,925
We spent so much time together, too.

945
00:56:55,895 --> 00:56:57,895
I think I'll miss this place a lot, too.

946
00:56:58,495 --> 00:57:00,595
I ran so hard here...

947
00:57:00,595 --> 00:57:02,695
and even had to drag tires.

948
00:57:04,195 --> 00:57:06,025
When do you have to go back to Taereung tomorrow?

949
00:57:06,125 --> 00:57:08,395
- Will you get to go on the match? 
- I think so.

950
00:57:08,755 --> 00:57:11,855
One of the senior members has a shoulder injury, so I'll probably...

951
00:57:12,555 --> 00:57:15,025
Look at you. That's awesome!

952
00:57:15,225 --> 00:57:17,695
Do you want to bet on who will win more medals at the Tokyo Olympics?

953
00:57:17,695 --> 00:57:18,755
How about 100 dollars? Are you in?

954
00:57:18,755 --> 00:57:20,425
Hey, 100 dollars is too little.

955
00:57:20,595 --> 00:57:22,025
It has to be at least 1,000 dollars.

956
00:57:22,295 --> 00:57:26,095
Also, I'll be more famous than you after the Olympics.

957
00:57:26,095 --> 00:57:27,455
Do you want my autograph?

958
00:57:27,725 --> 00:57:30,625
My gosh. Just make sure I'll be able to see you in Japan.

959
00:57:32,995 --> 00:57:34,055
Bok Joo.

960
00:57:36,695 --> 00:57:38,355
If I win a gold medal this time,

961
00:57:40,795 --> 00:57:41,825
would you marry me?

962
00:57:43,725 --> 00:57:44,855
I'll get pension, you know.

963
00:57:45,455 --> 00:57:46,725
I'll take care of you.

964
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:48,925
I'll think about it.

965
00:57:50,025 --> 00:57:52,955
But shouldn't you train hard if you want to win a gold medal?

966
00:57:53,555 --> 00:57:54,755
With that said, let's run together.

967
00:57:56,025 --> 00:57:59,025
Why would you want to run on our graduation day? No.

968
00:57:59,025 --> 00:58:00,755
You're a big slacker.

969
00:58:00,755 --> 00:58:03,195
If you slack off even just a day, your body will get stiff.

970
00:58:03,195 --> 00:58:05,195
- Let's run. 
- No.

971
00:58:05,195 --> 00:58:07,225
- Let's run. 
- I said no.

972
00:58:09,155 --> 00:58:10,195
I won't marry you.

973
00:58:11,425 --> 00:58:13,625
Hey. What do you mean you won't marry me?

974
00:58:13,625 --> 00:58:15,995
If you say that, now I have no choice but to run.

975
00:58:17,655 --> 00:58:18,725
I won't marry you.

976
00:58:19,555 --> 00:58:20,555
Hurry up.

977
00:58:21,655 --> 00:58:22,725
Hug me.

978
00:58:23,055 --> 00:58:24,855
Everyone spends their youthful years.

979
00:58:26,295 --> 00:58:28,155
It's a time more beautiful...

980
00:58:29,155 --> 00:58:31,655
because we're immature, and a time that sparkles brightly.

981
00:58:33,495 --> 00:58:35,725
We're not afraid because we have nothing to lose,

982
00:58:36,655 --> 00:58:39,295
and our hearts flutter because we can have anything.

983
00:58:41,525 --> 00:58:42,695
A 24-year-old youth.

984
00:58:43,755 --> 00:58:45,825
I'm not complete yet,

985
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,825
but I'm more than perfect already.

986
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:21,555
(We thank the immature but eager 21-year-old youths and the viewers.)

987
00:59:21,555 --> 00:59:29,125
(Dear youths who are living the present, you're awesome!)
