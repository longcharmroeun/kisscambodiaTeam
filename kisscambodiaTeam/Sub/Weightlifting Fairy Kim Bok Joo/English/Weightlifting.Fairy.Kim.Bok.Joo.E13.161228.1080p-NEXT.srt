Did you get in safely?

3
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,020
(Did you get in safely?)

4
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:41,590
How about you?

5
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,920
(How about you?)

6
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,020
You must be tired. Go to sleep.

7
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,950
You should go to sleep, too. You have training tomorrow.

8
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,850
(You should go to sleep, too. You have training tomorrow.)

9
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,890
You should go to sleep first.

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,850
No. You should go to sleep first.

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,050
(No. You should go to sleep first.)

12
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,160
This will take all night.

13
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,820
I'll go to sleep now, then.

14
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:19,290
(This will take all night. I'll go to sleep now, then.)

15
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,350
Are you asleep?

16
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,090
(Are you asleep?)

17
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,420
Stop it.

18
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,790
I can't sleep because of you.

19
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,420
(Stop it. I can't sleep because of you.)

(Episode 13, Round off Love, and It Becomes Jealousy)

21
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,620
Hello, guys.

22
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,750
- Hi.
- Hello.

23
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,220
Nan Hee. Good morning.

24
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,350
Hurry up.

25
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,820
What's up with you? Did you find a big piece of meat...

26
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,560
in your short rib soup earlier?

27
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,790
Mine only had broth.

28
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,950
Did you? I thought the soup was delicious.

29
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,950
Why are you so optimistic today?

30
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,990
You used to say you'd become the student president and add more meat.

31
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,620
Hey. Did something good happen?

32
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,750
No, it didn't.

33
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,620
It definitely looks like there's something going on.

34
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,520
Come to the toad's house.

35
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,320
(Come to the toad's house.)

36
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:52,920
- What is it?
- A spam message.

37
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,390
Yes!

38
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,190
Okay.

39
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,320
Why did you call me out so early?

40
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,490
I tossed a coin for you. Make a wish.

41
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,820
Hey. You told me to make a wish to do this, didn't you?

42
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,590
How did you become so sly?

43
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,590
You're no better yourself.

44
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,720
Don't you remember you threw yourself on me?

45
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,950
I didn't do that. You're the one who kissed me...

46
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,450
Yes. I just kissed you, but you grabbed my face...

47
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,590
and went wild like someone who had been starving...

48
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,620
All right.

49
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,950
Let's just say I threw myself on you.

50
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,360
By the way, isn't that hairpin...

51
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,420
the one you used to wear when you went to see Jae Yi?

52
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,390
- What? Yes.
- Jae Yi said it's pretty, right?

53
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,320
Or did he say it suits you well?

54
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,690
No. He didn't say that.

55
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,320
Don't you lie to me! I know he did!

56
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,250
Don't wear that anymore. Wear something else.

57
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,190
I have nothing else. Isn't this pretty?

58
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,790
It's not pretty at all. It's so ugly.

59
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,750
- Take it off.
- Stop it. I only have this hairpin.

60
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,550
Take it off! Take it off now.

61
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,150
Take it off.

62
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,290
Just take it...

63
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,750
You pulled out my hair!

64
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,220
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,390
Why don't you come with me? Let's go out.

66
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,450
Stop. My hands are coarse because I didn't put on hand cream.

67
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,820
It's fine. It feels like acupressure treatment. I like it.

68
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,920
Let's go, Weightlifting... I mean Chubs. Let's go.

69
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,590
Where are we going?

70
00:06:17,614 --> 00:06:29,614

71
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,820
Hey. Why did you want to come here?

72
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,050
I don't get it.

73
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,920
- Pick something you like.
- What?

74
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,450
Pick something you like. I'll buy you one.

75
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,150
From now on, don't wear anything else than that.

76
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,950
Don't wear that bow hairpin anymore, okay?

77
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,120
Joon Hyung. You're a very jealous guy.

78
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,620
My gosh. How can I not be jealous?

79
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,790
I've seen you crying out in tears because of Jae Yi.

80
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,890
You shouldn't be so petty and remember things like that.

81
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,290
It's all in the past.

82
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,150
Listen. Let me say this while we're at it.

83
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,290
I hate guys who get jealous over little things...

84
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,050
and play hard to get just because they're in a relationship.

85
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,390
I can't stand it. It's so childish.

86
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,450
So don't expect me to be okay with it.

87
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,250
- Are you going to pick one or not?
- I will. Which looks good?

88
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,120
What about this? It suits you very well.

89
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,090
A star?

90
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,950
My gosh. Bok Joo.

91
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,720
Why are you here, Bok Joo?

92
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,450
Bok Joo. Why are you on a hairpin?

93
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,690
I like this big one. What do you think?

94
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,020
Let me see.

95
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,690
Try it on this side.

96
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,250
How about this one?

97
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,820
It's a strawberry.

98
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,890
I know it's pretty even if I can't see it.

99
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,550
Gosh, Si Ho!

100
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,720
Wake up, Si Ho. Is anyone out there?

101
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,220
Si Ho.

102
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,850
Goodness.

103
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,290
Please help!

104
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,790
(Ambulance)

105
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,050
She looks very sick.

106
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,890
What is it?

107
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,250
What's going on?

108
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,090
Joon Hyung, Joon Hyung!

109
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,090
Hey, Joon Hyung.

110
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,820
Gosh, calm down.

111
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,590
Did Ki Seok call for a meeting?

112
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,420
It's not about Ki Seok. It's about Si Ho.

113
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,350
Si Ho took pills to kill herself.

114
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,720
Bok Joo found her passed out.

115
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,020
The ambulance took her to the hospital just now.

116
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,960
(Emergency Center)

117
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,460
Are you Si Ho's guardian?

118
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,890
Well, I guess so.

119
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,890
We cleaned out her stomach.

120
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,050
Her blood test shows that she didn't take many pills.

121
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,190
I don't think she tried to commit suicide.

122
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,090
However, she's very weak.

123
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,460
She's malnourished with elevated levels of liver enzymes.

124
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,020
She has reflux esophagitis.

125
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,350
She's also been suffering from bulimia and anorexia.

126
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,650
- We'll check her condition for now.
- Okay.

127
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,820
Thank you, Doctor.

128
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,150
Si Ho.

129
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,590
Si Ho, what happened to you?

130
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,790
What happened?

131
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,420
Please open your eyes.

132
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,290
Si Ho.

133
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,090
Si Ho.

134
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,050
Can you see me?

135
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,620
Mom.

136
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,490
Si Ho, it's me.

137
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,320
Si Ho.

138
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:37,920
Are you okay?

139
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,490
How's Si Ho? Is she okay?

140
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,120
I saw her wake up.

141
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,190
The doctor said she isn't in critical condition.

142
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,020
Thank goodness.

143
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,950
I think she's been taking pills for her insomnia.

144
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,690
She suffered from eating disorder, too.

145
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,350
She has to stay in the hospital because she's very weak.

146
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,650
I see.

147
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,890
Are you okay? Weren't you startled?

148
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,650
That's not that important.

149
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,320
I made a mistake.

150
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,190
When I told you that Si Ho wasn't doing well,

151
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,890
I should have done something.

152
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,220
I saw her binging at night.

153
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,290
You didn't know this would happen.

154
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,850
Don't blame yourself.

155
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,320
Still, I'm her roommate.

156
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,450
I should have checked on her when she was sleeping in.

157
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,650
I was too excited after getting your text.

158
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,550
- I'm so stupid.
- Hey.

159
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,120
Stop it. Your head isn't at fault.

160
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,720
Come here.

161
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,920
Gosh.

(Missed Call from Si Ho)

163
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,290

- I like the big one.

You promised me, okay?

170
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,950
You promised to reconsider...

173
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,590
Okay, don't worry about it.

174
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,520
No, I still don't believe you.

175
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,650
Promise me, please.

176
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,890
You're so silly. I promise.

177

Please get in the car.

- Goodness.

- Wait.

- Please take him home safely.
- Okay.

00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,650
Please get home safely.

183
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,790
I only have two dollars left.

184
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,190
Okay, I'll walk home, then.

185
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,690
Seong Eun.

186
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,820
Hey.

187
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,950
You just wait and see. I'll make sure you get hired back.

188
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,250
(Song Si Ho)

189
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,520
Joon Hyung.

190
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,550
Why are you alone?

191
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,290
My sister is at school, and Mom is at work.

192
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,720
Shouldn't you be lying down?

193
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,550
After a deep sleep, I feel completely fine...

194
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,120
as if nothing ever happened.

195
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,350
Shall we go out?

196
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,650
- Let's sit here for a while.
- Okay.

197
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,920
- Aren't you cold?
- I'm okay.

198
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,590
I'm sorry about...

199
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
missing your call...

200
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,190
yesterday.

201
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,150
I didn't know that you were sick.

202
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,420
I should have answered it.

203
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,990
It's okay. It's because I didn't take good care of myself.

204
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:54,990
Joon Hyung.

205
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,520
I feel very strange right now.

206
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,790
What happened was only a day ago.

207
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,790
Everything that happened before today seems like long ago.

208
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,620
Maybe it's because I almost died.

209
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,720
As you know,

210
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,220
we matured only through sports.

211
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,620
Life seemed to be over if we didn't stay competitive.

212
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,720
That's why I hung onto it without accepting it.

213
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,590
I knew I was going downhill.

214
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,220
I struggled while hanging at the edge of a cliff.

215
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,690
Now,

216
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,590
I can let everything go and train myself without much stress.

217
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,820
I knew it wasn't possible,

218
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,020
but I was persistent about getting back together.

219
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,350
I'm really sorry.

220
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,890
Now we're even.

221
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,120
We have something to apologize for.

222
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,820
Let's be friends.

223
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,990
You'd better respect me.

224
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,720
When are you getting out of the hospital?

225
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,290
Tomorrow or the day after that.

226
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,350
The doctor said that I got better,

227
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,690
but I haven't gotten better mentally.

228
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,520
I might see a psychiatrist.

229
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,390
I have a psychiatrist whom I'm seeing.

230
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,650
He's amazing.

231
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,590
Should I introduce him to you?

232
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,020
That'd be nice.

233
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,650
Hello, Bok Joo.

234
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:42,020
- Where are you?
- Me?

235
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,390
I'm at the hospital.

236
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,790
My coach let me have free time, so I stopped by.

237
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,350
I see.

238
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,120
How is Si Ho?

239
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,520
I think she's okay.

240
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,790
She's calmed down a lot.

241
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:56,690
I'm relieved to hear that.

242
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,120
I was thinking of visiting her. Why didn't you wait for me?

243
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,420
I thought you were in training.

244
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,390
Do you want to come now?

245
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,420
Should I? I'll be right there.

246
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,490
Okay, see you soon.

247
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,090
See you.

248
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,420
Why didn't he tell me before?

249
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,090
I'd have come with him.

250
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,220
What do you mean?

251
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,820
You're hiring a new coach?

252
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,660
This isn't what you said yesterday.

253
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,990
You said you'd reconsider.

254
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,850
You said you'll hold a committee meeting...

255
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,850
and convince the other members.

256
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,590
That was my intention,

257
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,050
but the higher-ups just notified me. What can I do?

258
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,350
I'm trying to help Coach Choi get her job back...

259
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,090
because she knows the students best,

260
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,350
and she has been a great mentor.

261
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,250
I know for a fact that she will continue to guide them well.

262
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,590
The decision has already been made.

263
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,190
My head is pounding, too. Let's stop talking about this!

264
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,250
Mr. Kim!

265
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,850
Fine.

266
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:59,090
If you're going to push through such an unfair decision,

267
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,020
I'm going to have to quit, too. Do whatever you want!

268
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,950
Wait. How dare you.

269
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,660
Come in.

270
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,350
Hey.

271
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,050
We were outside for a bit, so I was cold.

272
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,690
I see.

273
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,290
Are you feeling better?

274
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:34,290
I almost died. I'm happy to see you, my roommate.

275
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
Come have a seat.

276
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,160
Come here.

277
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,520
- This is for you.
- Thanks.

278
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,050
I figured you probably should be careful with what you eat now.

279
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,520
I thought they'd suit you because you're so feminine.

280
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,690
Thanks.

281
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,890
You're allergic to pollen, though. Will it be okay?

282
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:03,090
My nose is a little itchy, but it should be okay.

283
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,790
I didn't know about your allergy. Had I known,

284
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,420
I would've just gotten some drinks for you. I'll take it back.

285
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,660
It's okay. Let's just put it at the back.

286
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,290
I guess I talked too much. I'm dizzy. I should lie down.

287
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,590
I see. I'll do it for you.

288
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,590
I'll do it.

289
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,990
Here.

290
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,520
Why are you so quiet today? It's very unlike you.

291
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,790
Do I have to be a chatty mouth all the time?

292
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,550
Well, you're just unusually quiet today.

293
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,390
It'd be more unusual to spot a horse here.

294
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,450
Goodness!

295
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:14,850
That was such a terrible joke. It wasn't funny at all.

296
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,090
Thanks to my dad, I'm great at coming up with corny jokes.

297
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,420
How about we have a showdown?

298
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,720
Cut it out. Stop talking to me.

299
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,890
Gosh. Why are you so irritable today, Chubs?

300
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:26,920
I know why.

301
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,550
It's long past your snack time.

302
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,850
You're all grumpy because you're hungry.

303
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,120
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

304
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,120
Okay. Let's go get you something to eat.

305
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,020
Forget it. I'm not hungry.

306
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,020
You're not hungry?

307
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,920
Don't lie to my face. You're always hungry.

308
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,690
Come on. Let's go grab something to eat.

309
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,420
- I said I don't want to.
- Let's go.

310
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,990
Let's start with eomuk, which you love.

311
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,390
- Hello.
- Hello.

312
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,020
Here.

313
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,120
Which one shall I eat?

314
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,350
Hey, Si Ho.

315
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,250
No, I'm still out.

316
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:13,290
My psychiatrist? No, he's not at a big hospital.

317
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,720
He owns a small clinic.

318
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,290
My brother introduced him to me.

319
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,220
Well...

320
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,420
If you want long-term treatment,

321
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,720
I think it'll be better for you.

322
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,920
They just saw each other. Why do they have so much to talk about?

323
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,920
Get back together, then.

324
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,250
You can ask for a referral,

325
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,550
but my psychiatrist is really good.

326
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,160
No, it's not far from school.

327
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,720
Do you remember the pasta place we went together a long time ago?

328
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,520
It's about a block away from there.

329
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,290
Okay. Tell me if you want to see him.

330
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,120
I'll ask him his availability.

331
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,850
All right.

332
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,250
Hey, eat slowly or you'll get indigestion.

333
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,090
You said you didn't feel like eating anything.

334
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,320
You're a true natural-born glutton.

335
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,820
How about you aim for setting a new Guinness records, Piggy?

336
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,650
What? Piggy?

337
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,450
All right, sorry. I take that back. You're no Piggy.

338
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,490
You're just Chubs.

339
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,490
I can't even call you Chubs?

340
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,490
I've been calling you Chubs, though.

341
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,720
Fine. If you're going to be that sensitive,

342
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,720
I won't call you by nicknames...

343
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,550
like Piggy or Chubs ever again, Chubs.

344
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,450
Hey, stop. I'm sorry. Wait up.

345
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,720
- How much do we owe you?
- 16 dollars, please.

346
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,720
- How much?
- 16 dollars.

347
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,250
How many did she eat?

348
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,350
- Did she eat all of these?
- Yes.

349
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,590
Gosh, Bok Joo.

350
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:02,120
What's wrong? It's so unlike you to get mad over something like that.

351
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,350
Just leave me alone.

352
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,720
All right. I'll watch my mouth from now on.

353
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,190
Forgive me, okay? Please forgive me now.

354
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,550
- Come on.
- Leave me alone.

355
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,990
I told you to leave me alone. Why did you keep bugging me?

356
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,620
Bok Joo, look at this. I'm bleeding.

357
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,850
Look, I'm bleeding.

358
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:27,090
It's just a tiny scratch. Don't be such a crybaby.

359
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:30,050
What are you talking about? Scratches like this sting so much.

360
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,350
Just tell me why you're mad at me.

361
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,390
I don't think it's because I called you Piggy.

362
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,350
- I'm not mad.
- You are.

363
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,020
- I said I'm not.
- You totally are.

364
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,390
Why do you keep saying that? You're making me angry. You're so weird.

365
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,520
Go away! I have to go to my training.

366
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,920
She's definitely mad at me. What's the problem?

367
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:57,720
If he wants to know the reason, he should reflect on what he did.

368
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,650
Bok Joo, I didn't think you'd be like this. You're such a girl.

369
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:03,020
Have some manners.

370
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,890
What was he doing with his ex-girlfriend in front of me?

371
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,950
Did he really have to remind me that they used to date?

372
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,920
I didn't want to look childish, so I couldn't tell him why I got mad.

373
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,050
I'm so angry!

374
00:24:12,074 --> 00:24:24,074

375
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,420
I can't believe Professor Yoon quit, too.

376
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,650
What are we supposed to do now? Do we have to quit weightlifting?

377
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,820
Hey, I'm sure he didn't actually quit.

378
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,090
He probably just said it out of anger.

379
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,620
What happened to Professor Yoon?

380
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:41,850
I think he's been trying to help Coach Choi come back.

381
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:45,420
But they hired a new coach without telling him,

382
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,420
so he said that he wants to quit and stormed out.

383
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,290
Guys, let's just leave. Why are we even here?

384
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,150
- Even our professor doesn't care.
- Exactly.

385
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,520
He only cares about Coach Choi who spent the team's operating funds.

386
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,250
He doesn't care about us at all.

387
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,590
Guys, let's just quit this. Forget training. Let's go.

388
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,090
- Let's go.
- It's not Coach Choi's fault.

389
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:03,720
It's all my fault.

390
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,320
Coach Choi spent our operating funds...

391
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,590
to help me.

392
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,520
I'm sorry, guys.

393
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,850
It's all my fault.

394
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,720
I should've told everyone as soon as they started accusing her.

395
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,250
I couldn't because she didn't want me to.

396
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:31,320
See? I told you guys that Coach Choi would never do such a thing.

397
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,320
What should we do now?

398
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,990
We now know what happened.

399
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,520
Are we going to just let Coach Choi and Professor Yoon leave us?

400
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,650
Shouldn't we ask the school...

401
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:48,350
to consider the situation and forgive Professor Yoon?

402
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,050
Will they listen to us, though?

403
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,990
We'll have to make them listen to us.

404
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,490
We're very persistent, you know.

405
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:05,250
The weightlifting team wants Coach Choi Seong Eun back.

406
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,450
- We want her back.
- We want her back.

407
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,320
Please understand our situation.

408
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,050
- Please understand.
- Please understand.

409
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,020
- Please hire her back.
- Please hire her back.

410
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,820
- Hire her back.
- Hire her back.

411
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,790
(Why Does the Weightlifting Team Exist?)

412
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,890
Gosh, it's a lot colder than I expected.

413
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,820
I shouldn't have suggested doing this outside.

414
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,090
Hey, you said that we have to protest outside...

415
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:28,090
in order to show how much we want her back. It's seriously so cold.

416
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,020
Well, that's true.

417
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,090
I can stand the cold,

418
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,720
but I'm starving right now.

419
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,720
Hey, are you okay?

420
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,990
- I know you can't skip meals.
- I'm all right.

421
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:40,920
This is my life motto.

422
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,790
"I would rather be a hungry Socrates than a satisfied swine."

(We Want Our Coach Back!)

424
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,820
Gosh, I smell soybean paste stew.

425
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,620
It must be on the menu today.

426
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,620
No. It smells like soybean paste stew,

427
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,150
but I'm also getting a whiff of the ocean. It must be...

428
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,990
crab stew made with soybean paste.

429
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:01,550
Bok Joo is right.

430
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:04,250
- It's totally crab stew.
- It sounds so delicious.

431
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,590
It tastes amazing with rice.

432
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,420
- Gosh, it'll be so good.
- My goodness.

433
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,390
Stop, guys. You'll get hungrier if you keep on chatting like that.

434

437
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,520
What are they doing over there?

438
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,050
Members of the weightlifting team want Coach Choi back.

439
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,790
They're apparently on a hunger strike.

440
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,820
Goodness. They're really something.

441
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,450
Both the professor and his students are...

442
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,350
putting on a big show.

443
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:39,190
It's cold. They're going to stop soon. Let's go in.

444
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,220
"It's a day late, but happy birthday to you."

445
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,350
I guess the winter training is not hard enough.

446
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,290
You have so much free time.

447
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,320
I just came by during my dinner break.

448
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,720
I have to go after this coffee.

449
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,790
How about you? Are you seeing anyone?

450
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,590
You hardly come to my school to see Dr. Go these days.

451
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,150
I know.

452
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,420
I have a lot on my mind right now.

453
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:16,290
Why? Did Dr. Go tell you she can't wait for you to like her anymore?

454
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,320
Did she say she wants to end things?

455
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,420
You're good.

456
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,720
- She said something like that.
- I knew it.

457
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,450
A man and a woman can never be friends.

458
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,820
You have...

459
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,690
such a big problem.

460
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,390
How can you not sense things that even I can sense?

461
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,550
Tell me about it.

462
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,650
How about you? Are things going well with Bok Joo?

463
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,190
Of course they are. I'm not like you.

464
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,290
What?

465
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,990
- You confessed to her, didn't you?
- Well...

466
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,990
It's just...

467
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,890
Congratulations.

468
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:52,350
But it's still a bit hard.

469
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,050
Why do girls...

470
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,890
not tell guys what they're mad about...

471
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:58,790
and expect them to just know it?

472
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,590
Do they just like quizzes?

473
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,890
That's the charm of being in a relationship.

474
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,450
- Why? Is Bok Joo mad at you?
- Yes.

475
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:07,520
I have no idea why.

476
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,250
I feel like I'm in a maze.

477
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,590
Think about it carefully.

478
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:13,650
If you keep wandering through it, you'll find an exit eventually.

479
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,590
You're now in a relationship.

480
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,720
You're much better than me.

481
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,020
Of course I'm much better than you.

482
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:33,550
Isn't that Bok Joo?

483
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,790
(Hunger Strike Day 1, we want Coach Choi Seong Eun to come back.)

484
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,690

Can't you read?

489
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,120
We're on a strike. A hunger strike.

490
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,450
Hey. The temperature is below zero tonight.

491
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,520
What are you doing out here on a winter night?

492
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,350
Why do you care?

493
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:11,420
Mind your own business. It's something my team is doing.

494
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,650
How... How can I not care?

495
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,520
If you keep doing this, you'll freeze to death.

496
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,250
Even if I do, that's none of your business.

497
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,320
You have other things to care about.

498
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,020
You're surprisingly nosy.

499
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,250
Hey!

500
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,250
Stop talking to me like that.

501
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,290
I'm just worried about you.

502
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,520
Fine. No one can stop you.

503
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:43,720
Do whatever you want.

504
00:31:01,744 --> 00:31:13,744

505
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,290
You didn't answer your phone.

506
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,390
You did it on purpose, right?

507
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,390
Yes. I did.

508
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,850
I got too emotional that day.

509
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,390
I'm sorry.

510
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,720
I've been thinking about what you said.

511
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,250
For the past 10 years,

512
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,190
you've always been there for me.

513
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,420
When I had no one to eat with,

514
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,250
when I wanted to have a drink,

515
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,520
and when I needed a company to a party, you were there.

516
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,020
But I took it for granted.

517
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,690
Let's go out.

518
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,290
Let's try dating for real.

519
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,820
Jae Yi. You're so...

520
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,350
Do you think dating is a charity work?

521
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:19,720
You can't love someone by efforts, you fool.

522
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,850
Ah Young.

523
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,950
I appreciate the friendship you've shown me.

524
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,620
It's cold. You should go.

525
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:42,690
What is she doing out there in the middle of winter?

526
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,190
Dumb people ask for trouble.

527
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,820
Why is she mad at me?

528
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,820
I'll never know if she doesn't tell me.

529
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,520
- Gosh, it's snowing again.
- Hey.

530
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,820
- Is it snowing?
- Yes.

531
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,820
Gosh, it doesn't look like it will stop soon.

532
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:01,150
Gosh, it's so cold. The roads will become icy soon.

533
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,690
I'm so sick of winter. I hate cold weather.

534
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:13,090
Shall we take a break?

535
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,450
- Yes.
- That sounds good.

536
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:15,590
Let's take a break and brace ourselves.

537
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,990
- Okay.
- I should go to the bathroom.

538
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,950
(We want Coach Choi Seong Eun to come back.)

539
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,350
My feet are cold.

540
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,020
Put on your shoe.

541
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,790
Your arms.

542
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,290
Don't overstrain yourself.

543
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,090
Please.

544
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,290
What is Bok Joo doing there?

545
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,790
What? Who is that?

546
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,290
I don't know.

547
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,520
What is she doing there?

548
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,060
What? Isn't he from the swimming team?

549
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,620
- What?
- He is.

550
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,820
- I see.
- Oh, him.

551
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,490
I'll go now.

552
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:08,720
What is he doing here?

553
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,850
They look serious.

554
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:24,950
He's just my friend.

555
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,690
He's a nosy guy, and he just got worried about me.

556
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,690
I'm so jealous.

557
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:34,490
I wish I had a friend like him.

558
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:35,850
I'm so jealous of you.

559
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:58,250
The road is frozen from the snow yesterday.

560
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:01,390
Chang Geol, go in and lie down.

561
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,220
Am I a corpse or something?

562
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,820
I just got up. Why would I lie back down?

563
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,350
My back hurts because I've been lying down too long.

564
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,620
Don't you dare pass out again.

565
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,950
Why did that fall off out of the blue?

566
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,090
It seems fine.

567
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:24,060
I had a strange dream last night.

568
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,820
Give Bok Joo a call right now.

569
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,790
Why would anything happen to her? She returned to her training and...

570
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:32,890
Okay, I will.

571
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:39,620
Where are you, Bok Joo? Have you eaten?

572
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:40,850
(Second Day of Hunger Strike)

573
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:44,290
Of course I have. Today's menu was dried radish greens porridge.

574
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:49,220
I'm at the gym. How's Dad?

575
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,820
I'll call you later. Talk to you soon.

576
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:07,150
- Hyung Chul, don't fall asleep.
- Okay.

577
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,420
Keep your eyes open.

578
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,920
Wake up.

579
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,790
- Oh, my goodness.
- Hyung Chul!

580
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:17,790
Goodness.

581
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,620
I'll stay here. Take him to the infirmary.

582
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,090
- Let's take him to the infirmary.
- Goodness.

583
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:24,150
- Let's hurry up.
- Hyung Chul.

584
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,190
Poor Hyung Chul.

585
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,290
(This is Unfair.)

586
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:55,720
I can't do it anymore.

587
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:59,020
My legs are about to fall off.

588
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,250
Nan Hee, are you okay?

589
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,420
- Nan Hee.
- I'm not okay.

590
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:07,190
Bok Joo, your nose is bleeding.

591
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:09,490
Bok Joo.

592
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:14,120
Her nose is bleeding. What are we doing?

593
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,350
We can't continue this. You two should go in.

594
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,320
I think you've done enough.

595
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,290
No way. If we quit now,

596
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,350
we won't make any difference.

597
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:26,720
We might never see Coach Choi or Professor Yoon.

598
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,320
It's all because I felt guilty. What have I done?

599
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:31,620
Woon Gi.

600
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,390
Bok Joo. Nan Hee.

601
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,790
- Hello, Woon Gi.
- Seon Ok.

602
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:42,720
Seon Ok, why did you come so late?

603
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:46,020
I got worried, so I ran away when Mom went to the market.

604
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:47,290
Aren't you proud of me?

605
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:50,560
My goodness, do you know how hard...

606
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,290
it's been for me?

607
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,820
Don't worry anymore. You know my hourly rate is expensive, right?

608
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,560
Seon Ok.

609
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,190
Don't cry.

610
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:03,150
Come here, my babies.

611
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:07,560
I really missed you, Seon Ok.

612
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,920
Seon Ok.

613
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,850
You're my roommate.

614
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:20,720
- You weren't there with me.
- I know.

615
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:27,450
Woon Gi, we have big news.

616
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,290
This is what we just heard.

617
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:31,790
The new coach is hired because of personal connections with Mr. Kim.

618
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:35,720
He's never done weightlifting. He minored in physical education.

619
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:38,090
- How does it make sense?
- Now, the problem isn't...

620
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,060
only about Coach Choi.

621
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,720
Our team can't be a target for corruption.

622
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:45,250
Let's start a real fight.

623
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,790
- Let's do it.
- Let's fight.

624
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:49,950
I can't believe this. Let's do it.

625
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,590
- Okay.
- Goodness.

626
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,020
- Haneol is wrong.
- Haneol is wrong.

627
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,650
Stop the corruption.

628
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:56,190
- Stop the corruption.
- Stop the corruption.

629
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,720
Haneol is wrong.

630
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,220
- Haneol is wrong.
- Haneol is wrong.

631
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,920
Our coach can't be hired through personal connections.

632
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,690
- Don't look down on us.
- Don't look down on us.

633
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,220
Haneol is wrong.

634
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,650
- Haneol is wrong.
- Haneol is wrong.

635
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:07,320
Don't look down on us.

636
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,190
- Don't look down on us.
- Don't look down on us.

637
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:12,690
Our coach can't be hired through personal connections.

638
00:42:17,714 --> 00:42:29,714

639
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,020
What time is it?

640
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,120
(Mr. Kim)

641
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:48,020
This is Yoon Deok Man.

642
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,620
What?

643
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:53,450
My athletes?

644
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,650
What kind of hiring is this?

645
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,720
- What kind of hiring is this?
- What kind of hiring is this?

646
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,450
Rise, Haneol.

647
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,290
- Rise, Haneol.
- What are they doing?

648
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:02,820
What kind of hiring is this?

649
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,720
- What kind of hiring is this?
- What kind of hiring is this?

650
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:08,590
You guys, have you lost your mind?

651
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:11,950
Who told you to do this? You should be in training.

652
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,450
I'm really sorry, Professor Yoon.

653
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:16,820
However, we had to do something about it.

654
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:21,450
We want Coach Choi to come back, but that's not the only problem.

655
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:24,990
I can't accept a coach who's never done weightlifting before.

656
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:27,650
You punks.

657
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,020
What will you do...

658
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,690
if you also get in trouble?

659
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,890
- Go back to the gym now.
- No.

660
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:36,290
- Go back now.
- No, Professor Yoon.

661
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:38,020
- Go back now!
- No.

662
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,890
Gosh, I got it.

663
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:41,890
I have no choice.

664
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:44,120
Step on me if you want to keep going.

665
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,690
- No, Professor Yoon.
- Please get up.

666
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:49,050
I will never get up. No!

667
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:50,490
- Please get up.
- Get up.

668
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:51,590
- No, I won't.
- Professor Yoon.

669
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:53,090
- Please get up.
- Come on.

670
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:55,320
Fine, fine. I have a call.

671
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:57,890
- I knew this would happen.
- Please get up.

672
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:03,250
Hello? Yes, Mr. Kim.

673
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,090
I'm blocking the athletes right now.

674
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:10,650
Pardon me? Do you mean that?

675
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:12,520
Really?

676
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:14,790
Okay, thank you.

677
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:16,920
Thank you so much, Sir.

678
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,720
They'll hire back Coach Choi.

679
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,950
- What?
- Are you serious?

680
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:25,020
- Really?
- Yes.

681
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,820
The committee decided to cut her pay for three months...

682
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:29,950
but will hire her again.

683
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,720
- We did it.
- Yes.

684
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,720
Haneol University.

685
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,050
This is great.

686
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:55,020
(Hot pads)

687
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:06,450
Hello, Professor Yoon?

688
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:09,990
Pardon me?

689
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,420
What?

690
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,350
They'll rehire me?

691
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,920
- This is delicious.
- Here it is.

692
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,890
Here you go.

693
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:27,350
- This is awesome.
- Help yourselves.

694
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,720
This is my treat because I'm so proud of all of you.

695
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,820
Eat everything at this restaurant.

696
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:38,890
All right, raise your glass.

697
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,990
I was very moved by how our team came together...

698
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:45,050
this time.

699
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,320
Your determination showed that anything's possible.

700
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,550
There's no fear in solidarity.

701
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:52,790
As your professor, I learned a lot more.

702
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:55,890
Now that everyone is back on the team,

703
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,790
all we have left to do is training hard.

704
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,290
Let's go, everyone. We can do it.

705
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:04,450
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

706
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:05,690
Wait a minute.

707
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:11,190
Let's hear from Coach Choi who's finally back.

708
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:14,190
- No, it's okay.
- Come on out.

709
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:16,990
- Come on, Coach Choi.
- Stop it.

710
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:19,950
It's been a long time. Let's hear from Coach Choi.

711
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,390
Coach Choi!

712
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,090
Everyone.

713
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,020
I feel very embarrassed about what happened.

714
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:34,520
I'm sorry.

715
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,250
I'm grateful to you.

716
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:39,450
I really missed you all.

717
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:41,620
My goodness.

718
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:45,920
- Don't cry.
- Don't cry.

719
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,090
You should link arms and take a shot together to celebrate.

720
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:51,050
- Take a shot with linked arms?
- No thank you.

721
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:53,050
- Come on.
- Take a shot together.

722
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:54,620
- Take a shot together.
- Take a shot together.

723
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,690
Take a shot together.

724
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:57,920
- Stop it. We won't do it.
- Okay, fine.

725
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,820
Go!

726
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,050
Do you want to do it?

727
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,090
All right, here we go.

728
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:07,550
- There.
- Level two.

729
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:10,290
- Level 2.
- Level 2.

730
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:12,290
- Gosh.
- Level two.

731
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:15,020
- Level 2.
- Level 2.

732
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,320
Here, try it.

733
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:21,620
Wait!

734
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,550
Please take...

735
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:30,990
your arm off of her.

736
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:35,120
What are you doing?

737
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:38,990
Well...

738
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,290
That's right.

739
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:46,090
We're dating.

740
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,550
Coach Choi.

741
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,390
- My gosh.
- Seriously?

742
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:51,990
- Goodness.
- I'm so surprised.

743
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:54,790
Seong Eun and I are in a relationship.

744
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:00,150
- Coach Choi.
- My goodness.

745
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:02,850
- Gosh.
- This is awesome.

746
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:05,120
I can't believe this.

747
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:07,690
Dae Ho.

748
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,220
What was that about? Have you lost your mind?

749
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:11,920
What? What did I do?

750
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,050
How can you just go ahead and make that kind of announcement?

751
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,550
Well, it's not like I made it up...

752
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,050
Why are you so mad at me?

753
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:22,820
- Look, Bok Joo's uncle.
- Don't call me like that.

754
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,650
My name is Dae Ho, Kim Dae Ho.

755
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,150
And it's true that we're going out.

756
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,090
Am I wrong, Seong Eun?

757
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:31,550
Dae Ho.

758
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:33,150
I'm really sorry.

759
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:37,120
I should've told you a long time ago, but I was too drunk.

760
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,520
What are you talking about? We...

761
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:40,950
We kissed.

762
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:42,820
Gosh, this is crazy.

763
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,720
You got to take responsibility for what you've done.

764
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,220
You can't do this now.

765
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:48,720
Does a kiss mean nothing to you?

766
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:52,320
Dae Ho, I'm really sorry.

767
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:55,350
Go ahead and slap me. Here.

768
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:56,720
Come on. Just slap me.

769
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:00,120
- Come on. Just punch me!
- Gosh, why are you...

770
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,620
Goodness, I should really quit drinking.

771
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:07,790
This is driving me insane.

772
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:10,190
Is it because of Professor Yoon?

773
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,250
Are you not opening up to me...

774
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:17,890
because of Professor Yoon?

775
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:20,550
What are you talking about?

776
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:24,190
- That's not the reason.
- All right. That's great, then.

777
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:25,890
I didn't hear anything you said today,

778
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:28,350
so I'm going to keep liking you. Don't try to change my mind.

779
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:29,590
Dae Ho, wait.

780
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,390
Dae Ho!

781
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:44,420
What's going on?

782
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:47,320
Is she not able to pick up? Or is she just ignoring my calls?

783
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,490
What if she got sick and went into the emergency room?

784
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,490
- Why didn't they finish this?
- Goodness.

785
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,190
Let's clean up.

786
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,220
By the way, isn't that such big news?

787
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:02,620
It totally is.

788
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:04,390
I wonder when Coach Choi...

789
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:07,020
and Bok Joo's uncle started going out.

790
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:09,590
Who knows? I had no idea.

791
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,350
I'd love to make that kind of romantic announcement...

792
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:13,720
in front of everyone, too.

793
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:15,650
I'm honestly so jealous.

794
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:17,190
"We're dating."

795
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,520
- My gosh!
- Go, Uncle Dae Ho!

796
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:21,220
My goodness!

797
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,290
You silly girls.

798
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:23,820
You girls have no time to date now.

799
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:26,190
You don't even have enough time for training.

800
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,920
You can date guys when you're older.

801
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:30,950
Look at Bok Joo's uncle.

802
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:33,550
I've always been worried about that immature guy,

803
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,020
but he managed to find a good woman for himself.

804
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:38,650
- Yes, you're absolutely right.
- We'll remember your advice.

805
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,720
- No dating!
- Okay.

806
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:45,650
- "We're dating." - My gosh!

807
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:52,420
Why do you keep ignoring calls? Who is it?

808
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,820
I keep getting calls from an unknown number.

809
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,990
It must be a spam call.

810
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:00,920
Girls, our trio is finally together.

811
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,720
We have to do something special tonight.

812
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,590
Bok Joo, how about we stay up all night and chat in our room?

813
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:07,990
I've stashed a few bags of chips, too.

814
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:10,720
Are you guys going to be okay? Shouldn't you get some rest tonight?

815
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,390
The warm compresses helped, so I'm fine.

816
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:14,650
- Bok Joo, are you tired?
- What?

817
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:17,090
Well, I'm not feeling so bad...

818
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:19,590
But my arms and legs hurt a little,

819
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:21,120
and I have a bit of a headache.

820
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,950
All right, then. Let's rest up tonight,

821
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:24,590
and have fun after the training tomorrow.

822
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:26,420
I'll treat you girls tomorrow.

823
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,990
Okay! It's on you, then.

824
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:30,890
- Go in, Bok Joo.
- All right. Good night.

825
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:31,890
Good night.

826
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:34,120
- Come to our room if you're scared.
- Okay.

827
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,650
I'm sorry, girls. I'm such a horrible friend.

828
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:48,550
I used to hate girls who neglect their friends...

829
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:51,090
when they get boyfriends, but I need to date, too. All right?

830
00:51:51,114 --> 00:52:01,114

831
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:03,450
Why did you not answer my calls?

832
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:06,490
I didn't know you called. I just saw it now.

833
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:08,990
I kept calling you. I think I called you over 10 times.

834
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:11,650
Are you all right?

835
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,050
Well... My body aches a little,

836
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:17,220
and my feet hurt, but other than that, I'm okay.

837
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,990
Good.

838
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,420
Do you want to meet up?

839
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:26,050
We have some time until the evening roll call,

840
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,090
and I have something to give you.

841
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:46,150
Why did you want to meet here instead of the toad's house?

842
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,950
It's cold outside. You're not fully recovered yet.

843
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:53,520
Here. Thanks for letting me use it.

844
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:56,390
What? Is this what you wanted to give me?

845
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,820
That's disappointing.

846
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:00,790
You could've kept it for longer.

847
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:04,450
Goodness. What else were you expecting?

848
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,450
Do I need to buy you heating patches?

849
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:08,790
No, it's fine.

850
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:11,220
I need to know this, though.

851
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:12,790
Why are you mad at me?

852
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,790
What are you talking about? I'm not mad at you.

853
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:17,120
I know that you are.

854
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,620
That's why you threw a fit at me.

855
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:21,650
I really don't think it's because of me calling you Piggy.

856
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:25,520
What is it? I won't know what I did wrong if you don't tell me!

857
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:30,220
Hey.

858
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,850
I didn't want to look childish, so I wasn't going to say anything...

859
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:37,290
Tell me.

860
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:39,990
You're so sweet to your ex-girlfriend.

861
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:43,650
Fine, I get it. She's sick. I understand that part.

862
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,620
But how can you go on about her pollen allergy in front of me?

863
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:48,050
Did you have to be that obvious?

864
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:49,720
Then you didn't even notice me pigging out...

865
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,550
and talked to her on the phone for so long.

866
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:53,590
Did you two have that much to talk about?

867
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:55,720
Was that the reason?

868
00:53:56,990 --> 00:53:59,090
Yes. You inconsiderate, mean jerk!

869
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:02,490
Gosh, I had no idea you'd be like this.

870
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,890
Didn't you say that you hate the childish, jealous type?

871
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:07,190
You went on about it.

872
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:10,490
You're totally the jealous type. My goodness.

873
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:11,650
I find this very refreshing.

874
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:13,420
Are you mocking me now?

875
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:15,920
Hey.

876
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,790
With Si Ho, I know that we used to date,

877
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:20,890
but I felt bad that I didn't answer her call...

878
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:22,490
that day.

879
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:24,990
And we sorted it all out before you arrived.

880
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:27,520
She said we should just be friends.

881
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:32,020
How can you stay as friends with your ex-girlfriend?

882
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:35,420
Let's be honest here. Don't you have a past, too?

883
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,690
In my case, it was just a crush.

884
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:38,890
It's different from your case.

885
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:41,450
You're really something, Bok Joo.

886
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:43,050
You're so cute.

887
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:44,550
You're seriously so adorable.

888
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:46,520
Go away. I don't like physical contact.

889
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,590
Don't lie to my face. I know you love it.

890
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:51,290
- What are you talking about?
- Okay. I'll be careful from now on.

891
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,390
So just tell me, okay?

892
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:54,920
That way, I'll know.

893
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:57,450
Let's tell each other everything,

894
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:01,090
from being stressed out to feeling sad or embarrassed.

895
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:05,720
I'll see.

896
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:11,450
This is so cute. Who got it for you?

897
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:13,650
Dr. Jeong.

898
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:17,490
I'm going to go see Si Ho.

899
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,450
Hey.

900
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:25,550
All right. Come here.

901
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:27,150
Come here.

902
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,620
So are we good now?

903
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,220
No, I'm still mad at you.

904
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:33,990
Seriously?

905
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,350
Oh, hello.

906
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:53,950
(Haneol Sport University)

907
00:55:58,050 --> 00:55:59,050
Did you have a good sleep?

908
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:00,850
People will see us.

909
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:03,290
- Did you dream about me?
- Let go of me.

910
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:05,790
- You can't catch a cold.
- Gosh, hey.

911
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:10,020
Hey.

912
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:11,620
There's Si Ho. Si Ho!

913
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:20,220
Did you just get discharged? Let me help you.

914
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,450
Are you feeling better? I'll help you with your bag.

915
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:31,320
It's okay. I should've stayed at the hospital if I couldn't carry it.

916
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:34,350
It looks like you two have gotten very close.

917
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,720
Don't make it so obvious, though.

918
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,850
I'll get all jealous and be sick again.

919
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:45,190
No, we're not that close.

920
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:47,650
Never mind, then. I'll see you later.

921
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:52,250
What?

922
00:56:56,190 --> 00:56:58,220
Hey! Gosh, seriously.

923
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,020
You're cold, right?

924
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,220
Turn around. Look at me.

925
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,720
You're doing so well, Joon Hyung.

926
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,820
Like what you just did, don't ever look at other girls,

927
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,850
and you can be as mannerless as you want.

928
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:22,190
Also, don't wear things that show your chest. Got it?

929
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:23,650
Yes, Ma'am.

930
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:25,350
You're so cute. Let's go.

931
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:27,150
Come on.

932
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,950
You're hurting my arm. It hurts.

933
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:32,390
Win or lose, rock-paper-scissors!

934
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:34,790
- You lost.
- What is this for?

935
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:36,250
A flick on the forehead.

936
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:37,950
Come here.

937
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,190
Gosh. All right. So this is how you want to play it.

938
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:44,290
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

939
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,150
Come here.

940
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:49,790
Rock-paper-scissors.

941
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:53,520
Gosh. Go ahead.

942
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:55,150
You're so dead.

943
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:57,620
Hey. Hold on. Go easy.

944
00:57:57,620 --> 00:58:00,250
- I'll flick you twice if you dodge.
- All right.

945
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:01,650
I let you win. Wait.

946
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:04,290
There!

947
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:08,320
It hurts, doesn't it? I'm so sorry. I forgot to control my power.

948
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,790
- Gosh, it really hurts.
- I'm sorry.

949
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:13,050
- Let's break up.
- Don't get mad.

950
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:15,250
- Let's break up.
- No, Joon Hyung.

951
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:18,220
- Have a laugh. Come on.
- My gosh.

952
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:21,120
Hey, stop it. Stop.

953
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:22,950
Stop it.

954
00:58:34,974 --> 00:58:46,974

(Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo)

956
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:51,090
Don't you ever betray us, okay?

957
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:52,120
Especially you, Bok Joo.

958
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,120
I was going to ask you. Why do we have to see each other secretly?

959
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,120
Do I embarrass you?

960
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,950
What on earth is this?

961
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:01,890
It's fine. It's not like you have a boyfriend to impress.

962
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:04,720
I can't even go to the cafeteria because Joon Hyung might see me.

963
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,890
Come down to the lobby. Can't you come out just for a second?

964
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:08,990
Hey. Stop it. We shouldn't do this.

965
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:10,720
Bok Joo. We're coming in.
