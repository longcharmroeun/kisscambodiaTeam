00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,130
If you go this way, you'll see the pool.

2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,730
Thank you.

00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,230
Joon Hyung.

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,130
Bok Joo.

6
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,160
Joon Hyung.

7
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,230
Can you recognize me?

8
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,160
It's me, Mom.

9
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,960
Are you really Joon Hyung?

10
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,190
My goodness.

11
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,460
I always wanted to know...

12
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,790
how you'd turn out after growing up.

13
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,030
You grew up to be much better than I thought.

14
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,360
I wonder if...

15
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,660
Joon Hyung met his mom by now.

16
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,430
I think so. She went to his school today.

17
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,590
I hope she doesn't mention the postcards.

18
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,890
I begged her not to.

19
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,590
Joon Hyung's mom isn't dumb.

20
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,290
Why would she mention that? It'd only hurt Joon Hyung.

21
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,030
I wonder if she'll recognize him.

22
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,790
I don't know the area.

23
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,360
I got lost, so I asked someone.

24
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,730
Coincidentally, she turned out to be your friend.

25
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,560
Are you very close to her?

26
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,130
Yes.

27
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,560
Have you eaten?

28
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,430
- If you're hungry, let's get... - No.

29
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,260
I'm not hungry.

30
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,030
Okay.

31
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,890
How's swimming?

32
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,560
Isn't it difficult?

33
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,190
Is it okay?

34
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,660
Yes, I guess.

35
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,660
By the way,

36
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,630
I have this.

37
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,460
This is for you.

38
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,890
I didn't know what you needed.

39
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,760
It's a pair of sneakers.

40
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,230
I thought you could use a pair.

41
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,060
I hope they fit you.

42
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,830
I guessed your size.

43
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,890
Thank you.

44
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,090
I'll make good use of them.

45
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,930
While buying the present,

46
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,660
I thought about you very much.

47
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,830
I wondered how much taller you got.

48
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,490
I wondered how your face changed.

50
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,730
I'm sorry, Joon Hyung.

51
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,990
I should have come earlier to see you.

52
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,060
I was too busy.

53
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,930
Okay.

54
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,960
Hello, Mom.

55
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:43,430
(Episode 15, That's How You Become an Adult)

56
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,130
I didn't have much time to prepare.

57
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,190
I hope you like the food.

58
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,160
It's very delicious.

59
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,490
Your cooking is amazing as always.

60
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,430
It's not so true these days.

61
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,660
Perhaps she's getting old because her food is getting saltier.

62
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,960
Father, you might regret later for saying that.

63
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,660
The fish is very plump.

64
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,960
You made a great choice.

65
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,300
Here you go.

66
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:11,960
Thank you.

67
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,330
Mom. Water, please.

68
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,430
- Okay. - Okay.

69
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,660
Pardon me.

70
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,960
You can give it to him.

71
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,660
Okay.

72
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,360
Here you go, Joon Hyung.

73
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,360
Are you okay?

74
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,160
Yes, thank you.

75
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,060
I can catch the taxi by myself.

76
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,190
- Please get in. It's cold. - Okay.

77
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,130
Joon Hyung.

78
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,290
Do you want to come see me tomorrow?

79
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,560
Before I leave,

80
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:53,590
I want to make you a meal.

81
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,130
- If you aren't free... - I'll come.

82
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,030
After the training.

83
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,230
- Could you give me your number? - Okay.

84
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,090
See you tomorrow, my son.

85
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,060
- Get home safe. - Bye.

86
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,360
Hello.

87
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,230
You look happy.

88
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,660
How was it with your mom?

89
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,960
There's not much to say.

90
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,830
Yes, there is. You look much happier than before.

91
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,890
Is it obvious?

92
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,590
Yes, it's very obvious.

93
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,360
What did you do with your mom?

94
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,660
We went home and had dinner.

95
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,560
I walked her to the taxi home.

96
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,360
That's it?

97
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,630
I'll go see her again tomorrow.

98
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:32,990
What else?

99
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,260
I held my mom's hand.

100
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,960
It was very warm.

101
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,790
I'm getting jealous, but I'll let it go this time...

102
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,960
since she's your mom.

103
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,900
I think your mom missed you very much.

104
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,190
She came all the way here from Canada.

105
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,190
Of course.

106
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:01,490
Why wouldn't she want to see a handsome son like me?

107
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:06,900
You seem very confident after seeing your mom.

108
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,090
I shouldn't be jealous.

109
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,190
I'd love to have a mom who came to visit me at school.

110
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,060
You have a dad who supports you.

111
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,530
You also have a great uncle.

112
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,030
More importantly, you have me.

113
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,830
That's right.

114
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,260
I forgot about that.

115
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,630
Is it Spring Residence room number 1803?

116
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,430
I'm leaving now. It'll take about 30 minutes.

117
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,660
Okay, see you soon.

118
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,400
By the way,

119
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,900
can you bring a photo album if you have one?

120
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,630
I want to see your photos...

121
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,590
when you were young.

122
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,400
I'll bring some from home.

123
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,990
Okay. I'll see you later.

124
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,130
Gosh, it's too small.

125
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,330
I'll just have to squeeze my feet into them.

126
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,660
I sent 10,000 dollars to Mom's bank account.

127
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,460
All right.

128
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,460
If I put that together with the money I have,

129
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,560
it'd be 20,000 dollars.

130
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,930
Thank you. I'm sure you need money for other things, too.

131
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,060
It's fine. It's not like I need the money right now.

132
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,660
By the way, is her child in a serious condition?

133
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,860
Can she get her child a surgery if she goes back with the money?

134
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:21,660
I'm not sure.

135
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,760
She has to get enough money for the surgery first.

136
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,730
I feel bad that...

137
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,290
her young child got a rare disease.

138
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,490
I guess she thought her brother could give her the money,

139
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,530
but selling land takes time.

140
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,360
She wouldn't have asked us for money if she had a choice.

141
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,530
What money?

142
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,860
Joon Hyung.

143
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,560
When did you get here? We didn't hear you come in.

144
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,530
Money?

145
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,960
What are you talking about?

146
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,660
Joon Hyung. Let's sit down and...

147
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,490
Is my mom here for money?

148
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,460
Did she need money?

149
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,390
Is that why she suddenly...

150
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,860
But why is she...

151
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,990
asking you for the money?

152
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,830
She should be grateful that you've fed me and raised me so far.

153
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,430
How...

154
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,290
How could she ask you two for such a favor?

155
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,860
Joon Hyung. It's not that. She had a reason for it.

156
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,830
Even if she did, this is not right.

157
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,290
It's so brazen to do that.

158
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,830
She hasn't contacted us for the last 10 years.

159
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,130
How...

160
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,030
How could she do this?

161
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,190
I knew it all along.

162
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,930
The postcards and presents I got every year.

163
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,460
I know it was you who sent them.

164
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,660
You should've been honest with me.

165
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,590
I was miserable thinking how long I should keep pretending,

166
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,030
and when I should end this show.

167
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,360
But I still felt bad because you were trying so hard.

168
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,030
Why would you give her that money? Do you feel sorry for me?

169
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,730
Or what is it?

170
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,590
Did you think you'd do just one more charity work...

171
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,930
since you've been merciful all along?

172
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,990
Did you want to look like a good person?

173
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,830
Is that it?

174
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,390
You're right.

175
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,130
I did it because I wanted to go to paradise.

176
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,590
That's why I raised you. Are you happy now?

177
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,430
You ungrateful brat.

178
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,590
How could you say such harsh things?

179
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,530
I just... I can't believe you.

180
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:43,930
Joon Hyung.

181
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:52,360
Bok Joo. You're slacking off.

182
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,630
How long are you going to sit there and wrap the bandage?

183
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,260
Are you a mummy?

184
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,290
- No, Sir. I will start right away. - You brat.

185
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,460
You won a tournament and got all lazy.

186
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,790
If you're going to keep doing this, just quit and go to Taereung!

187
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:07,930
Pardon?

188
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,990
They want you in the Taereung National Training Center.

189
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,730
Go to Taereung, you brat.

190
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,030
The association made a decision today.

191
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,290
You should join them within this weekend.

192
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,030
What?

193
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,760
- Hey! - Congratulations!

194
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,390
The Daily Sports will come to interview you tomorrow.

195
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,660
They want to hear about how our team came to the front...

196
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,760
at the last tournament.

197
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,660
Thank you so much. Thank you, Bok Joo.

198
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,890
You brat. You did it.

199
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,330
- What's happening? - Congratulations.

200
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,160
- Congratulations. - Way to go, Bok Joo.

201
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,190
- You did it. - Well done.

202
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,990
- Go, Bok Joo! - Let's go!

203
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,030
Delivery service.

204
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,960
You can put it over there.

205
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,930
Three radishes, three spring onions, and one scallion, right?

206
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,760
Mr. Kim usually delivers them.

207
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,660
Oh, he went to have a vasectomy.

208
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,190
He doesn't want to have four children.

209
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,360
He loves his wife so much.

210
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,960
By the way, I'm thirsty. Can I have a bottle of soda?

211
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,830
Sure.

212
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,590
Here.

214
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:53,990
That felt good.

215
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,830
Thank you.

216
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:06,530
Wake up. I still haven't come to my senses.

217
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,560
Women are wicked.

218
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,630
You're going to Taereung. It's amazing, Bok Joo.

219
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,760
- Your dream is finally coming true. - What did your dad say?

220
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,460
- He must be so happy. - He is.

221
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,760
My dad's dream was to be a national athlete.

222
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,730
He must think his hard work at the restaurant is finally paying off.

223
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,630
You're doing a great thing to your dad.

224
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,790
This would be the greatest news to your dad.

225
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,660
I'm not sure. I can't really feel it yet.

226
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,190
Am I really a national athlete now?

227
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,390
Am I really going to Taereung?

228
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,290
It doesn't feel real that you're going to be stay apart from us.

229
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:49,530
We're surely sad, but how would Joon Hyung feel?

230
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,160
You two just started dating.

231
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,060
- You have to be apart already. - I know.

232
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,660
It's certainly a good thing, but Joon Hyung might feel bad.

233
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,100
The number you have dialed cannot be reached at the moment.

234
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,100
You'll be directed to voice mail.

235
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,530
Please leave a message...

236
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,860
The number you have dialed cannot be reached at the moment.

237
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,030
You'll be directed to the voice mail.

238
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,330
Please leave a message after the tone.

239
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,990
What is it? Is Joon Hyung not answering his phone?

240
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,360
It's not that.

241
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,630
Actually, you're right. He doesn't normally turn off his phone.

242
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,190
That's the mire of dating.

243
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,390
You get worried if he doesn't call you,

244
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,530
and you think he has changed if he sounds different...

245
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,100
on the phone even just a little.

246
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,660
Gosh, dating is too hard for me.

247
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,130
Enjoy it while you can. We're young.

248
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,330
The number you have dialed cannot be reached at the moment.

249
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,930
He's not answering. His phone is off.

250
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,290
It's our fault.

251
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,560
We should've been honest with Joon Hyung.

252
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,600
That poor little thing.

253
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,130
He was pretending not to know about the show we were putting on.

254
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,230
It must have broken his heart.

255
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,890
We all meant well.

256
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,390
Don't blame yourself, Honey.

257
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,190
Joon Hyung is going to be okay, right?

258
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,330
Of course he is. He's not a child.

259
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:33,490
- Hello? - It's me.

260
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,560
Yes. Hi.

261
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,330
I was wondering if something happened to Joon Hyung.

262
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,600
He said he was coming, but he didn't.

263
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,930
His phone is also turned off.

264
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,860
(Girls' Dormitory)

265
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:53,260
My face is swollen, right? I will look ugly in the picture.

266
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,360
Hey. Why are you making a fuss? They're interviewing Bok Joo.

267
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,790
They'll still take a picture of us all together.

268
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,960
I'm doing this to revive weightlifting.

269
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,260
Listen. Kim Yu Na of figure skating, and Son Yeon Jae of gymnastics.

270
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,490
There should be a star weightlifter,

271
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,390
who will make weightlifting popular.

272
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,660
Besides, you're one to talk. What are you wearing?

273
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,730
Bok Joo.

274
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,390
- Hello. - Hey, Tae Kwon.

275
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,600
I was thinking about calling you.

276
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,660
- Were with Joon Hyung last night? - What?

277
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,460
What are you...

278
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,930
Didn't Joon Hyung come back to the dormitory last night?

279
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,460
His phone was turned off, so I assumed he'd be with you.

280
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,960
Where did he go? I'm getting worried.

281
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,760
When did you talk to him the last?

282
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,730
In the afternoon yesterday.

283
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,100
Does this mean Joon Hyung went missing yesterday?

284
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,990
Gosh, what's going on?

285
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,190
After he left home like that...

286
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,130
I couldn't reach him.

287
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,890
I still thought he would've gone back to school.

288
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,230
He must've been shocked.

289
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,030
His mother came back...

290
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,160
after 10 years because of money, not because of him.

291
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,560
But still, it's so immature of him to disappear like this.

292
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,290
He's a soft-hearted guy.

293
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,890
He just got mature too early.

294
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,660
He's just used to having to put up a tough front.

295
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
I know.

296
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,430
My mom couldn't sleep at all last night.

297
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,030
She has never hit Joon Hyung before.

298
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,830
I'll keep trying to track him down, too.

299
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,730
If you hear from him, let me know immediately.

300
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:38,930
Please.

301
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,790
(Leader of Athletic Education, Haneol Sport University)

302
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,430
- It must be them. - It must be them.

303
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,790
Goodness, stop putting on such a show.

304
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,330
Why are you guys overreacting?

305
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,160
Did you not hear what Professor Yoon said?

306
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,130
The interview is nothing special.

307
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,790
- Just be natural. Do what you... - They're here.

308
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,560
My sweat suit isn't dry yet.

309
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,830
What?

310
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,890
Let's go inside.

311
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,160
- Okay. - Look at what he's wearing.

312
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,190
- What's up with him? - Why is he wearing a suit?

313
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,030
- Professor Yoon. - Let's practice.

314
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,190
Really? Let's do something else.

315
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,030
Hey, can't you just tell us what's going on?

316
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,730
By any chance, did Joon Hyung's family go bankrupt?

317
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,130
Hey, his family owns a pharmacy.

318
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,730
Why would a pharmacy go bankrupt?

319
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,360
I don't know what's going on, but don't worry. I'm sure it's nothing.

320
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,360
That's right. He's probably just drinking somewhere.

321
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,730
What if he's dangling off a bridge...

322
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,790
The number you have dialed cannot be reached at the moment.

323
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,990
Please leave a message after the tone.

324
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:10,330
Joon Hyung, I heard about what happened.

325
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,560
I know how upset you must be now.

326
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,960
I'm so worried about you, though. Please call me back.

327
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,330
No, you don't have to call me. Just text me.

328
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,860
Okay?

329
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,360
All right, Joon Hyung?

330
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,530
Darn it!

331
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,290
Woon Gi, straighten your back. More! That's good.

332
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,060
Hey, your legs!

333
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,990
They're shaking. Watch me! Like this.

334
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:18,130
Like this! Is that all you can do?

335
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,130
Hey, Ye Bin.

336
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:23,190
Be careful. You can dislocate your shoulders that way.

337
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,030
Watch your shoulders.

338
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,760
Good.

339
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,660
Hey, focus on your lower body!

340
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,360
- Ye Bin. - Mom, I'm on television.

341
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,430
Bok Joo, congratulations on being selected for the national team.

342
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:43,560
I actually heard you went through a slump after winning the match.

343
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:47,060
May I ask you how you managed to overcome it?

344
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:52,660
I took some time off from training and did a lot of thinking.

345
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,760
I also got help from people around me.

346
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,460
Who are some of the people that helped you?

347
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,030
My family members, of course.

348
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,830
My professor, my coach,

349
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,390
my best friends, Lee Seon Ok and Jeong Nan Hee,

350
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,990
and...

351
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,430
Bok Joo.

352
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,590
The ace of Haneol's weightlifting team.

353
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,730
You won't make any mistakes.

354
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,660
You've been training so hard, and you're such a strong person.

355
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,660
And...

356
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:53,130
I'm really sorry, but I think we should end the interview here.

357
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,490
Something very urgent has come up for me.

358
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,260
I'm sorry. I sincerely apologize.

359
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,460
- Bok Joo. - What's going on?

360
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,390
- Bok Joo. - Bok Joo.

361
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,290
Bok Joo.

362
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:18,730
Please leave a message after the tone.

363
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,490
Joon Hyung, where on earth are you right now?

364
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,860
Your brother and everyone else are so worried about you.

365
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,560
I'm really worried, too.

366
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,330
Call me as soon as you get this message.

367
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,360
I'm starting to get so mad at you.

368
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,660
Call me back, okay?

369
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,230
Where did this guy go?

370
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,330
Joon Hyung, this fool...

371
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,160
Where are you?

372
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,160
The number you have dialed cannot be reached at the moment.

373
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,260
Gosh...

374
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:11,090
Hey, where are you? Why aren't you picking up?

375
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,930
I had no idea that you were this self-centered.

376
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:19,190
Let's just break up if this is how you're going to be. You're a jerk.

377
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:24,160
What if he got into an accident or something?

378
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,890
Where are you?

379
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,660
Well...

380
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:32,530
Ma'am.

381
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,860
How much will my total be if I take out these two things?

382
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,290
I didn't bring my wallet.

383
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,560
I can pay the rest. I'll get this, too.

384
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,660
You work at Bok Chicken, right?

385
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,390
We're even now.

386
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,860
I see that you can drink quite a bit.

387
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,290
You must like soju.

388
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,130
Yes. Beer tastes like nothing to me.

389
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,330
You must love chips.

390
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,390
You're like a kid. It's so cute.

391
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,090
I think I'm a little too old to be called cute.

392
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,660
But you are really cute.

393
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,260
You have a cute face.

394
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:25,530
You're my type.

395
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,790
By the way, is Bok Chicken yours?

396
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,290
Are you the owner?

397
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,560
No, my brother owns it.

398
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:38,130
I'm actually an actor. I've only played minor roles, though.

399
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,260
Seriously? Which films or dramas were you in?

400
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,360
Oh, you know. I played one of the crewmen...

401
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,890
in the film that came out recently, "Train to Bucheon".

402
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:49,030
I also played Sawing Man Number Three in "Inside Men".

403
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,590
Right, that sawing scene.

404
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,460
Yes, you do look familiar.

405
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,260
You were that man with the saw.

406
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,030
That scene was so scary.

407
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:02,090
That wasn't even one of my best performances.

408
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,590
Thanks for remembering it.

409
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,730
If you don't mind, can you reenact the scene for me?

410
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,160
I was so impressed by it.

411
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,630
How can I reenact the scene here...

412
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,330
I'll cut here and here.

413
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,930
My gosh! You're awesome. You look just like him!

414
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,930
Of course I look like him. I'm the one who played that role.

415
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,330
All right, bottoms up.

416
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,530
Gosh, you're a celebrity.

417
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:34,030
Let's have just one more drink at my place.

418
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,760
- Please? - Well, I can't. We shouldn't.

419
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,760
We're going way too fast.

420
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,560
I won't lay a finger on you.

421
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,260
We're just going to drink, okay?

422
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:44,730
- Wait, my ear. - What?

423
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:47,560
- Gosh, hold on. My ear is... - What's wrong?

424
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,830
(Dead End)

425
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,730
- Let's go! - You're so manly.

426
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,760
Here we go!

427
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,660
Yes, Dr. Jeong. Not yet.

428
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,490
I went to all the places that he could be but couldn't find him.

429
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,660
Okay. I'll call you if I find him.

430
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,460
Bye.

431
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,490
(Indoor Swimming Pool)

432
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:50,460
Joon Hyung!

433
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:57,560
What are you doing here? Come out now.

434
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,360
Are you dead, you jerk?

435
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,390
Tell me if you're dead, you punk!

436
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,730
Come out now.

437
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,990
I'm going to get you.

438
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,190
Do you know how worried I was?

439
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,330
I went to Han River in case you jumped off the bridge.

440
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:50,890
Why did you turn off your phone?

441
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:54,160
You need a good beating to come back to your senses.

442
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,230
What are you doing, Joon Hyung?

443
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,030
Joon Hyung.

444
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,960
Gosh.

445
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,260
Are you okay?

446
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,990
Bok Joo.

447
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,990
Mom didn't come to see me.

448
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,390
She came here for money.

449
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:30,790
To borrow money.

450
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,730
My assumption was completely wrong.

451
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,490
Even though I missed Mom to death,

452
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,930
I persevered through it.

453
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,230
I thought it was the same for her.

454
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,390
Only I was happy to see her.

455
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,190
It's so embarrassing.

456
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,090
I'm embarrassed...

457
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,260
for myself.

458
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,660
I feel embarrassed in front of Uncle and Aunt.

459
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,390
Compared to when Mom abandoned me,

460
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,890
I'm much sadder now.

This is your voice message box.

463
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,890
Hey, where are you? Why aren't you picking up?

464
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:04,030
I had no idea that you were this self-centered.

465
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:07,660
Let's just break up if this is how you're going to be. You're a jerk.

466
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,890
It's too big and smells like old rags.

467
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,030
Do you have a smaller one?

468
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
It's the smallest one there is.

469
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,000
Just think of it as a hip-hop style outfit.

470
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,790
Your hair is still wet.

471
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,790
There you go.

472
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,760
- You're so cute, my baby. - Hey.

473
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:47,190
I'm not your baby. Did you give birth to me?

474
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,930
Yes, I'm your real mother. You're so immature.

475
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,860
Do you know how worried I was?

476
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,630
What you did was terrible.

477
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,090
I know.

478
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,930
I heard your voice messages.

479
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,530
Will you break up with me?

480
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:13,730
- Are you breaking up with me? - It's a warning.

481
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,930
If you cut off contact one more time,

482
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,790
I won't forgive you then.

483
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,290
You like me very much, don't you?

484
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,390
How can you say that at a moment like this?

485
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,390
- That hurts. - You need more beating.

486
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:30,560
This is on behalf of your aunt and uncle.

487
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,860
These are from your mom and Dr. Jeong.

488
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,790
These are from me.

489
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:37,030
You have really strong hands. It really hurts.

490
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:41,390
Let's get out. I'm worried that the security will find us.

491
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,590
No.

492
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:45,860
I can't go.

493
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,660
Why not?

494
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:51,160
- I don't have any shoes. - What?

495
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,500
I threw them away.

496
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:00,230
My goodness.

497
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,730
Why did you throw away your shoes?

498
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,260
You're walking barefoot in the middle of winter.

499
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,030
You're so dumb.

500
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:10,500
It was because I was so mad.

501
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,130
It's impossible to carry you to the dormitory.

502
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:19,390
It's okay, I'll walk back. I walked here barefoot, too.

503
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,000
No, you might get a frostbite in this weather.

504
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:25,160
Stay on that bench.

505
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:28,360
Where are you going?

506
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,060
Here you go.

507
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,790
I took them from the senior lockers in the weightlifting room.

508
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,190
Give them back tomorrow.

509
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,290
Thank you.

510
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:47,760
Gosh, I even steal shoes for you.

511
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,390
Are you cold?

512
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,290
You're being so considerate.

513
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,230
At least you have a mom to blame.

514
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,530
I don't even have a mom.

515
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,360
Those who have complain more.

516
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:21,390
- I'm sorry. - Don't be.

517
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:24,660
You shouldn't apologize to me.

518
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,130
You might feel hurt by this,

519
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,230
but I can understand your mom a little.

520
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,830
Every child is dear to his parents.

521
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:42,190
You're dear to her,

522
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:45,130
but her other child is sick.

523
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,190
She must help her sick child first.

524
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:51,860
It doesn't mean that she doesn't love you.

525
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,590
It's difficult for your mom,

526
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,390
but can you imagine how difficult it is for your aunt?

527
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,030
Go and comfort her now.

528
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,530
She couldn't sleep a wink last night.

529
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,660
How did you know that?

530
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,160
- Did you meet Jae Yi? - What else could I do?

531
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,660
You didn't pick up my calls.

532
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,860
My only contact was Dr. Jeong.

533
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,230
You're making me angrier.

534
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:30,090
Go home and make your aunt feel better.

535
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,160
Okay.

536
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:37,260
- I'll go back tomorrow. - No way.

537
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,330
Go home now.

538
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,000
Is it because you feel embarrassed for what you've done?

539
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,230
It gets worse tomorrow. Go home now.

540
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,760
Let's stay one more minute.

541
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,860
(Couple Pharmacy)

542
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,930
Okay. You didn't have to walk me all the way here.

543
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:01,590
It's because I'm worried that...

544
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,290
you'd go somewhere else.

545
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:05,760
Your walking me home doesn't make me look good.

546
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,460
Gosh, what's the big deal?

547
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,560
Women can walk men home, too.

548
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,460
- Okay, Ma'am. - Go home. It's cold.

549
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:16,590
Ask for their forgiveness and tell them you won't do it again.

550
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,500
Give these to make them feel better.

551
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,390
I'm afraid that they're very disappointed in me.

552
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,060
Moms don't get disappointed in their sons.

553
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,160
Just give her a tight hug. Go in now.

554
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,000
Thank you.

555
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,930
Gosh, it's so cold.

556
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:09,500
Don't you need an electric heater at the pharmacy?

557
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,660
Where's Dad?

558
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,030
He went home first.

559
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:17,960
What's that?

560
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,000
This? Roasted chestnuts.

561
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,430
There was a vendor selling them on my way here. You like chestnuts.

562
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,590
Gosh, you didn't have to. It's too late to eat anything.

563
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,660
You probably don't want the soot on your hands.

564
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,930
I must say, you can be so fussy at times.

565
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:37,000
What can I do?

566
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,660
I shall peel them for you, then.

567
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,500
What now?

568
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:56,060
Eat them before they get cold, or they won't taste as good.

569
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,790
Your hands are so cold.

570
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,000
I'll make you a cup of citron tea.

571
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:18,260
I'm sorry, Mom.

572
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,530
Please forgive me.

573
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,130
I'll never do that again.

574
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:29,860
You should've been strict with me.

575
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:33,330
You spoiled me by coddling me all the time.

576
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,660
What? You brat.

577
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,660
I'm speechless.

578
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:39,330
Mom.

579
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,890
I'm really sorry.

580
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:46,590
You probably don't know...

581
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,060
how grateful I am to have you, Dad,

582
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,460
and Jae Yi in my life...

583
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,460
and how much...

584
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,960
I love you guys.

585
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:03,500
I love you so much more...

586
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,190
than you think...

587
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:08,760
because my family...

588
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,500
means so much to me.

589
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:20,330
Your smell.

590
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,060
I was too upset to even wash my hair.

591
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,390
I knew it!

592
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:30,460
Does it smell bad?

593
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,790
- Yes, it stinks. - Stop teasing me, you silly.

594
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,330
- Come here. - Why?

595
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:39,630
My gosh, you're so sweet.

Joon Hyung.

599
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,660
I didn't expect the traffic to be so bad.

600
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,330
I didn't think I'd be able to see you before I go.

601
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,930
Thank you so much for coming.

602
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,390
- Well, Joon Hyung. - Thanks for giving birth to me.

603
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:24,500
I came to tell you that.

604
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:28,860
And...

605
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:31,530
Take this.

606
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,960
It's yours, so I should give it back to you.

607
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,660
I don't think I'll need it anymore.

608
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:59,590
By the way, do you happen to have a photo of my sister?

609
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:01,260
I want to see what she looks like.

610
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:04,290
What? Yes, sure.

611
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,560
Her name is Emily.

612
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:18,760
She's a pretty girl. She sure takes after you.

613
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:25,060
She'll recover soon. You should bring her next time you visit.

614
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:27,530
All right.

615
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:31,290
She'll be so happy to meet her handsome brother.

616
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:39,760
You met her on my campus, right?

617
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:43,460
She's my girlfriend.

618
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:45,490
Oh, this girl.

619
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:47,590
I see.

620
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:51,130
She's very pretty.

621
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,790
Did you say goodbye to your mom?

622
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:02,660
Yes.

623
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:04,730
Good.

624
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,430
I'm happy because you listened to me.

625
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,430
I'm yours, so I have to listen to you.

628
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:32,230
You're still so clumsy.

629
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:36,430
I don't think that's enough to smash this desk, though.

630
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:39,060
What brings you here? When did you get here?

631
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:41,030
I was in the area,

632
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:44,090
so I thought I should just stop by.

633
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,090
You probably won't believe that.

634
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:49,660
I'm here to see you.

635
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:50,990
I closed my clinic early today.

636
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:54,730
What has gotten into you? You've never done this before.

637
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,460
The nurse told me that you only work in the morning on Saturdays.

638
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:00,730
I must be your last patient.

639
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:03,230
Let's go grab some food.

640
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:04,830
I'm hungry.

641
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:06,890
You came all the way here for food?

642
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:09,330
Well...

643
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:12,530
Except for you, I don't even have friends to eat with.

644
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:15,460
Let's go eat something.

645
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:25,960
- Gosh, he's so handsome. - He really is.

646
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:27,830
- My goodness. - He's so good-looking.

647
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:29,660
- He's so handsome. - That must be his girlfriend.

648
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:32,630
- Whatever. He's seriously so cute. - I'm really jealous.

649
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,060
He's the most handsome guy I've ever seen.

650
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:36,930
- Look at him. - He's so cute.

651
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:38,930
Hey, ouch. What are you doing?

652
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:42,060
You have to cover your face as much as possible from now on, okay?

653
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:45,230
Nothing can really mask my good looks, all right?

654
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:51,260
Why do you have to be this handsome?

655
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:52,760
How about you shave your head?

656
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,560
I'll do it if you want me to.

657
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:58,560
I can't go away...

658
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,130
because I'll be too nervous about some other girl snatching you.

659
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:06,430
Joon Hyung,

660
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:09,830
I haven't told you because I didn't want to upset you.

661
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:13,290
I got selected for the national team.

662
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:14,960
I have to move to Taereung next week.

663
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,460
Whatever. Don't lie.

664
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,660
The world championships will take place in China in February.

665
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:23,530
What?

666
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:25,090
Are you serious?

667
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,590
Seriously?

668
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:29,760
Really? My gosh...

669
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:31,660
Hey, congratulations.

670
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,660
How did you manage to do that with those heavy weights?

671
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,890
I'm more amazed by you because you can float in water.

672
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:39,760
You're not sad about it?

673
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:43,390
We just started going out, and we'll be a long-distance couple now.

674
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,830
I won't be able to visit you often.

675
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:47,330
It's okay. I'll follow you there soon.

676
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,260
What?

677
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:51,230
I have a match next week.

678
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:53,930
They'll pick members for the national team, too.

679
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:56,490
If I win the first place, I can go straight to Taereung.

680
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,830
We also have a world championship tournament coming up.

681
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:00,860
Seriously? Can you really join the national team if you win the match?

682
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:01,890
Yes.

683
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:04,860
If I get the second place, they'll take a look at my previous scores.

684
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:08,630
But if I win the first place, I can join the national team immediately.

685
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:11,760
I was going to take it a little easy this time,

686
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:14,190
but I feel my competitive juices starting to flow all of a sudden.

687
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:16,490
Are you confident that you can win?

688
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:17,830
Of course.

689
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:20,360
I can beat anyone in the world if my trauma doesn't get in the way.

690
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:22,930
Joon Hyung, I really want to go to Taereung with you.

691
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:24,860
- Let's go together. - Don't you worry.

692
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,060
I'm going to beat everyone at the match.

693
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:28,830
I'll follow you there shortly, okay?

694
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:31,090
I really want us to go to Taereung together. Please.

695
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,760
Go!

696
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,830
Hey, I don't need extra training right away.

697
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:47,060
You missed your training for two full days.

698
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,090
You have to win the first place, you know.

699
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:50,660
Come on. Start with running. Hurry up.

700
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:52,730
Let's eat something first.

701
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,190
You wish. Just run first.

702
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:56,890
I'll run if you give me a kiss.

703
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:06,330
Don't let me catch you!

704
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:08,530
Hey!

705
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,130
That's it. Keep going.

706
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:17,160
Hey, Joon Hyung. Watch your head!

707
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:19,330
One, two. The pace is great!

708
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:21,160
Keep going, guys.

709
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,130
One, two. Great.

710
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,260
Joon Hyung, you seem to be in a great shape. Good job.

711
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,460
Hey, did you really make this?

712
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:59,360
It's so good.

713
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,630
I'm happy to see you enjoying it.

Hey, go run now if you're done. Hurry up.

715
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:09,230
I just ate. Running immediately after eating causes stomach pain.

716
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:11,660
- I can't. I can't run now. - Come on!

717
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:13,530
Whatever. I won't run.

718
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:15,190
Hurry up. Go run now. You're totally fine.

719
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:17,490
Let's go. Come on. Start running, will you?

720
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:19,060
I'll run if you kiss me.

721
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,490
Gosh, you think it's fun, don't you? I'll kiss you if you finish running.

722
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,030
Go and run first.

723
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,630
Hurry up and run.

724
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:40,930
I love you, too.

725
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,290
Stop looking back.

726
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:46,860
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

727
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,060
I wish my dear Joon Hyung will...

728
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:54,060
overcome his trauma of the false start, win the tournament,

729
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:56,960
and go to Taereung National Training Center with me.

730
00:50:57,530 --> 00:50:59,590
Me, too. I wish for the same thing.

731
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,890
You have to make it come true.

732
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:13,130
(Joon Hyung's match, Going to Taereung)

733
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:15,930
(The Selection Contest for the National Swimming Team)

734
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:33,930
Now, it's men's 200m final.

735
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:36,560
The players are entering the pool.

736
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:51,990
Choi Tae Hoon in the fifth lane...

737
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:53,930
did his individual training in Australia...

738
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:56,490
and came back to Korea for this contest.

739
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:00,090
I wonder if his training will make a great result.

740
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:03,160
I see the one who made a false start at the last Presidential Cup.

741
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,830
- You mean Jeong Joon Hyung. - Yes.

742
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:07,230
If he makes a good start,

743
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:09,960
- he will achieve a good result. - He's always sadly defeated...

744
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,660
because of the start.

745
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,860
Will he be able to overcome his trauma...

746
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:15,960
at this final game?

747
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,490
It's going to be very interesting.

748
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:29,660
All right. Choi Tae Hoon was the quickest one to start the race.

749
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:32,360
Jeong Joon Hyung made a good start, too.

750
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:42,230
Joon Hyung is picking up the speed.

751
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:43,890
- He's catching up. - That's right.

752
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:46,390
Joon Hyung is going at a great speed.

753
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:48,990
He's only a span away from Tae Hoon.

754
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:51,430
- He almost caught up to him. - He's coming up fast.

755
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:54,390
Now...

756
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:56,960
It looks like they came in almost at the same time.

757
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,760
That's right. They finished at the same time.

758
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:05,660
All right. That means...

759
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:07,430
Choi Tae Hoon won the first place,

760
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:10,830
and Jeong Joon Hyung won the second place by a nose.

761
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:13,230
Yes. Joon Hyung was amazing.

762
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,360
This is Kim Chang Geol.

763
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,430
Pardon? A donor?

764
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:27,560
I see. I can't go in today,

765
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:30,290
but I can go to the hospital tomorrow.

766
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:34,890
All right. Okay. I'll go to the hospital tomorrow afternoon.

767
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:37,090
Okay. Thank you.

768
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,460
What is it? Do they want you to have the surgery?

769
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:42,130
Did they find a donor?

770
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:44,760
Yes. I'm the second one on the list, but they said...

771
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:47,460
there's still a chance.

772
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:51,390
They set up additional tests for me and want me to come in today.

773
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:52,660
Why did you say you'll go tomorrow?

774
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:54,830
You should go when they ask you to.

775
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:58,260
You brat. I should go after Bok Joo goes into Taereung.

776
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:01,490
If I say I have to go to the hospital, she would be worried.

777
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:03,830
You can't hide this from her.

778
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:06,460
Even if I get the surgery, I won't tell her until they set the date.

779
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:08,760
Maybe I'll tell her after setting the date.

780
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,160
I still think you should tell her.

781
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,130
What if she gets mad at me later because of this?

782
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:45,490
You did great. You were the best, Joon Hyung.

783
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:49,630
I could have won if my arms were a little bit longer.

784
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,330
I wanted to win and go into Taereung with you.

785
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:57,590
Don't say that. You couldn't have done it better.

786
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:00,460
You completely overcame your trauma.

787
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,430
You're going to win the first place next time.

788
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,430
You're only going to get better.

789
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,230
You'll be leaving...

790
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:16,790
in 13 hours 26 minutes...

791
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:19,490
and 15 seconds. 14 seconds.

792
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:23,660
Bok Joo. I'm not sure I'll be okay if I don't see you.

793
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,760
I'm the one who is more worried.

794
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,290
You made me get addicted to you without realizing.

795
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:35,430
I know I have deadly charms.

796
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,160
You shouldn't run away from there because you miss me,

797
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,130
so I will follow you in there soon.

798
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:46,660
If you break up with me and start seeing someone else, I'll kill you.

799
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:49,530
That's what I want to say.

800
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:52,160
I already asked Seon Ok and Nan Hee to keep an eye on you.

801
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:54,530
Those girls.

802
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,560
They ruined everything.

803
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,990
What time are you leaving tomorrow? Let me see you off.

804
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,490
No. I'll go by myself.

805
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,930
You said you'll join me soon.

806
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:09,590
You don't have time to see me off. You should train hard.

807
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:12,090
Gosh. You already sound so proud of being a national athlete.

808
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,930
Now I have to go into Taereung.

809
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:17,060
Please do. No one is stopping you.

810
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:21,590
When you're free, please visit my dad's restaurant.

811
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:24,890
My uncle takes care of him, but I'm still worried.

812
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:27,230
Okay. You can trust me.

813
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:34,330
We only have 13 hours 22 minutes...

814
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:36,860
12 seconds. 11 seconds.

815
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:37,890
Hello, Nan Hee?

816
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:41,160
Your uniform? Why do you want me to bring it?

817
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:45,390
Well... Yes, I am outside. Fine.

818
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:48,330
I'll drop by the gym. I'll see you later. Okay.

819
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:51,930
- Do your friends need something? - Yes.

820
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:54,730
- I should drop by the gym. - Okay. Let's go.

821
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:04,860
What? Why is it so dark? Why are all lights turned off?

822
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:07,930
Hey. This is a chance.

823
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:09,560
For what?

824
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,930
No. What if someone walks in?

825
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,460
No one would walk in. There's nobody here.

826
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,830
- Surprise! - Surprise!

827
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,260
Here, Bok Joo. Let me pour you one.

828
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:30,290
Yes, Professor.

829
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:35,730
I told the coach at Taereung...

830
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:38,160
to take good care of my special pupil.

831
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:40,860
You should try not to hurt your back in particular.

832
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:44,060
- You have to take care of yourself. - Yes, Coach.

833
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:46,330
Thank you.

834
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:49,530
I couldn't have done it without your help.

835
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:52,760
Gosh, what's wrong? It's not like we will never see her again.

836
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,030
It's true that we won't be seeing her for a while.

837
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:57,860
She won't be here for the jog, lunch,

838
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:59,760
and training for snatch, clean and jerk.

839
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,830
Who's going to be my partner now, Bok Joo?

840
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:05,460
You have Seon Ok. You're just trying to stop me from leaving.

841
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:08,430
By the way, you've been standing still over there...

842
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:10,060
for a while. What's your name?

843
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,460
I'm Jeong Joon Hyung, a sophomore at the swimming team.

844
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,530
Even his voice sounds amazing.

845
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:16,190
You're so handsome.

846
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,960
Good for you, Bok Joo.

847
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,860
Bok Joo is lucky to have a boyfriend like that.

848
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,930
He reminds me of myself when I was 20 years old.

849
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:25,930
I used to look like that.

850
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:27,360
I doubt that, Professor.

851
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,130
- You're a big liar. - It's not a lie.

852
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:32,390
Even my nickname was...

853
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:35,890
All right. Bok Joo, I hope your training goes well at Taereung,

854
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:38,960
and you will raise Korean weightlifting's prestige in China.

855
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,790
All right, guys. Cheers!

856
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:43,160
- Cheers! - Cheers!

857
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,790
- Thank you. I'll work hard. - Congratulations.

858
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:47,090
- Cheers, Bok Joo. - It's delicious.

859
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:50,460
- Can we eat now? - Go ahead.

860
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,660
Here. It's bellflower roots.

861
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,060
It boosts your immune system. Eat it when you have a cold.

862
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:15,630
This is ginseng extract.

863
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:18,660
Don't forget to drink one pack every day. Okay?

864
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,430
Take care of yourself.

865
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:23,760
Dad.

866
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:28,230
Bok Joo. Should I drive you there with my scooter?

867
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:31,130
No. I'll just take the bus by myself.

868
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:33,130
All right, then.

869
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:36,730
Uncle. Please take good care of my dad.

870
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:39,060
I'll count on you.

871
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,260
I'll look after him. Don't worry about it,

872
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:44,630
and take care of yourself.

873
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:47,360
Eat well and train hard.

874
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:54,430
Kim Bok Joo of Haneol Sport University, reporting for...

875
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:56,730
departure to Taereung. Salute!

876
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,160
Salute!

877
00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:02,630
- Take care. - Okay. Don't come out, Dad. Bye.

878
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:08,830
Chang Geol.

879
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:10,790
Bok Joo's gone now. Let's go to the hospital.

880
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,730
Joon Hyung. I'm going now.

881
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:27,960
I didn't show it to you,

882
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,360
but I'm so scared and nervous right now.

883
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:34,660
Will I be able to do a good job?

884
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:37,260
If I open the strange door and walk through it,

885
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:39,830
what kind of world will be waiting for me?

886
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:44,430
Don't worry, Bok Joo.

887
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:46,230
You'll be great.

888
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,190
You're much stronger and prettier than...

889
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:50,390
you think you are.

890
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,730
Wherever you go, you'll shine brightly.

891
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:54,860
Bok Joo, you're awesome.

893
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:04,890
I'll be waiting for you, Joon Hyung.

894
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:07,230
Don't take too long, though.

895
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:08,930
I'm a short-tempered girl.

896
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:12,730
Wait for me. I will be there soon.

897
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:14,990
You know I never turn back, right?

898
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,760
I miss you,

899
01:01:19,890 --> 01:01:20,990
Joon Hyung.

900
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:23,660
I miss you,

901
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:25,390
Bok Joo.

(Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo)

904
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:41,190
Bok Joo. Can you see that I'm totally in love with you?

905
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:42,790
I'd never fool around with anyone else.

906
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:45,590
Joon Hyung just came back. He stinks of a girl's perfume.

907
01:01:45,590 --> 01:01:48,430
I moved here to avoid you. I wanted to be away from you.

908
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:49,590
So don't come here again.

909
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:51,930
I hate Seoul without you in it. It's too lonely.

910
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:54,660
I guess men are all the same. Joon Hyung has changed, too.

911
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:57,530
What's wrong? You two were madly in love. Did you guys fight?

912
01:01:57,630 --> 01:01:59,790
What's the matter? It's not something to get mad about.

913
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:01,830
I never thought you'd do this to me, Joon Hyung.
