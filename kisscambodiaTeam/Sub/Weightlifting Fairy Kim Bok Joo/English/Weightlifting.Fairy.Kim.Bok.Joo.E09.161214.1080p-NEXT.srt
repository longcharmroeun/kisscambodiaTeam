Bok Joo.

3
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,120
It is you, Bok Joo.

4
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,060
Why are you here?

5
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,090
Bok Joo! You should've called me if you got here.

6
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,420
She said she wanted to see my school...

7
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,720
before she goes abroad, so I told her to come.

00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,890
Jae Yi. Let me explain.

10
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,960
Actually...

11
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,860
Don't tell him.

12
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,960
I'm a student here in the weightlifting team.

13
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,390
I lied about majoring in cello and also about...

14
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,190
going abroad to study.

15
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,430
I'm sorry, Dr. Jeong.

16
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,490
I was also surprised when I first saw her in your clinic.

17
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,120
But what could I do?

18
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,490
Bok Joo begged me to keep it a secret.

19
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,020
You still should have hinted me on that.

20
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,760
I had no idea.

21
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,090
I'm saying I couldn't do that.

22
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,690
- She was so desperate. - What's the reason?

23
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,560
- What? - Why did she...

24
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,220
lie to come to my clinic? She's a weightlifter.

25
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,160
Well, that's...

26
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,820
Maybe she wanted to lose weight.

27
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,690
It looked like she recently started to like someone.

28
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,560
She's a girl, too.

29
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,490
That's understandable.

30
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,060
Anyway, Bok Joo had a very hard time herself.

31
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,090
Her team found out about it.

32
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,360
Her professor and coach got so mad,

33
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,390
and her dad was also furious. It was a total mess.

34
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,190
Really?

35
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,890
Gosh, I feel guilty.

36
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,860
What should I do?

37
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,330
You didn't know anything.

38
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,290
It's her fault that she lied to you.

39
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,120
But she's a strength athlete, and I made her lose weight.

40
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,960
Forget it. It's all over now.

41
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,860
She lied to you about going abroad to study...

42
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,360
because she thought she couldn't go to your clinic anymore.

43
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,960
Just don't mind her.

44
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,660
Who is the guy she likes?

45
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,890
Jae Yi.

46
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,760
What?

47
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,760
I'm hungry.

48
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,320
Why did he come here out of the blue?

49
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,990
It's all over now, right?

50
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,890
He must think I'm nothing but a big liar, right?

51
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,390
This isn't supposed to happen. It's the worst. What should I do?

52
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,460
In order to make a lie true,

53
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,160
you need seven lies.

54
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,990
While a lie produces another lie,

55
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,960
and that lie bears another lie again,

56
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,290
I became a lying machine.

57
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,720
What should I do now?

58
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,820
I'm so ashamed of myself.

(Episode 9, The Merits of a Secret Crush)

60
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,660
Bok Joo!

61
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,160
She's not here, either.

62
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,890
Where did she go? She's not answering her phone.

63
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,820
Did she eat ginseng or something? What's wrong with her?

64
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,130
I'm not sure.

65
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,260
What if she ran into that doctor in spite of our efforts?

66
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,560
It can't be. Joon Hyung took her out safely, right?

67
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,490
- That's what his friend said. - I know.

68
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,590
Then what's the source of that superhuman strength?

69
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,390
- She hurt her back earlier, right? - That crazy girl.

70
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,020
Hey. She stopped. Go and stop her from doing that.

71
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,020
I can't handle her, either. She's like a crazy bull right now.

72
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,220
- Stop it! - Stop!

73
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,520
You're losing your balance as you go on, Si Ho.

74
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,860
Your movements are...

75
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,290
all delayed because you're watching your turn only.

76
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,590
This won't work. Let's play it safe and just do four turns.

77
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,990
No. I'll try it again.

78
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,720
Okay. Keep on practicing for now,

79
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,990
and we will adjust it later if you can't.

80
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,260
That was amazing. Coach, did you see how Soo Bin just did that?

81
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,590
That was amazing.

82
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,820
Why don't you practice your own work instead?

83
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,490
I just wanted to give it a try.

84
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,890
To see how difficult it was.

85
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,160
Hello, Si Eon.

86
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,020
Did Dad leave home?

87
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,960
- Did he take his things, too? - Yes.

88
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,560
He said he'll be in Ulsan.

89
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,460
He found a job there on purpose.

90
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,260
Mom went to work without even looking at him.

91
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,160
People keep visiting the house to see if they want to buy it.

92
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,290
What have you done for us?

93
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,690
I told you to stop this from happening no matter what.

94
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,020
You should have stopped her.

95
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,890
I talked to Mom, but...

96
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,790
If you talk to her once,

97
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,820
did you think Mom would stop?

98
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,790
You should have threatened her,

99
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,260
begged her to stop, or done anything you could.

100
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,560
This happened to us all because of your gymnastics.

101
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,490
Don't look for me.

102
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,720
Si Eon!

103
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,690
No one can stop her. She's lost her mind.

104
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,220
I don't know anymore.

105
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,790
She'll be exhausted before the night ends.

106
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,560
What's wrong with her?

107
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,220
I want to know the reason.

108
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,690
I don't know, either.

109
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,320
She must be dissatisfied about something.

110
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,290
I don't even want to know.

111
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,320
I'm tired of her acting like this.

112
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,860
It looks like she'll stop soon.

113
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,660
My goodness.

114
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,820
Take it off.

115
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,190
Get up.

116
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,720
Oh, my goodness.

117
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,290
I'll die earlier because of this.

118
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,120
Hey.

119
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,860
- Aren't you going to tell me? - It's none of your business.

120
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,890
Knowing won't do you any good. Stay out of it.

121
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,690
Why can't your brother,

122
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,790
who's a gentleman unlike you,

123
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,090
meet Bok Joo?

124
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,460
What? Are you trying to make fun of me?

125
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,760
Since we're getting off campus after a long time,

126
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,660
I prepared something very special for us.

127
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,990
If you don't tell me, I won't tell you, either.

128
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,620
Fine, I don't care anyway.

129
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,860
It's a 3-to-3 date.

130
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,760
They're the queens of Sukyoung Women's University.

131
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,490
One of them is my friend on social media.

132
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,860
She's absolutely beautiful.

133
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,390
She's photogenic like a celebrity.

134
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:48,920
What do you say?

135
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,860
I don't believe you.

136
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,790
What have we got to lose? Let's check it out.

137
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,230
This might be a great opportunity for us.

138
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,990
Hello, Si Ho.

139
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,660
She's cold like the Ice Queen.

140
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,690
Your grip is too close.

141
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,320
Hold the weight more like this.

142
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,290
Bok Joo, tighten your hands more.

143
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,390
More, more!

144
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,990
Engage your abs more.

145
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,760
That's right. Engage them more.

146
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,860
Engage your abs.

147
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,360
You look out of focus.

148
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,960
- Squat more quickly. - Coach Choi.

149
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,490
You should send them home early.

150
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,230
It's their last weekend before the competition.

151
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,390
Professor Yoon, their weight hasn't increased enough yet.

152
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,560
They need more strength.

153
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,960
- They can't take time off. - That's why.

154
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,990
They should eat some healthy food at home.

155
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,060
Okay, Professor Yoon.

156
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,360
Eat with determination and not for the taste.

157
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,990
Woon Gi must increase by 1kg, and Bok Joo by 1.5kg.

158
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,990
- Understand? - Yes, Coach.

159
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,120
- Yes, Coach. - Go and get some fresh air.

160
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,690
Let your family encourage you.

161
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,920
Relax and eat delicious food.

162
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,690
If you don't increase your weight,

163
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,120
be prepared to eat 10 meals a day, okay?

164
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,590
Yes, Sir.

165
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,620
Isn't it difficult to increase your weight?

166
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,990
It's okay. I'm not the only one having a hard time.

167
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,730
If you're tired of eating protein,

168
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,490
add eggs and make bread with it.

169
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,860
Sang Chul told me about it, so I tried.

170
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,160
I like it because of the texture.

171
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,060
Okay, I'll try it.

172
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,490
- Are you going home? - Not yet.

173
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,520
Someone is picking me up.

174
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,230
- Goodness gracious. - I'll try it.

175
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,760
You can't just leave after messing up the seat.

176
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,730
It's only some milk powder.

177
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,620
I don't need to pay for laundry, do I?

178
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,960
Bok Joo, I have to get going.

179
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,920
See you, Woon Gi.

180
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,790
Since you're English Literature majors,

181
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,660
traveling abroad wouldn't be a problem, right?

182
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,620
Aren't you fluent in English like native speakers?

183
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,820
That's not true.

184
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,160
You don't swim across the Pacific Ocean because you're a swimmer.

185
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
Cross the Pacific Ocean?

186
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,790
You have such a great sense of humor.

187
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,860
Are you...

188
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,190
usually this quiet?

189
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,060
Yes, compared to him.

190
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,720
In which category do you compete?

191
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,120
Is it short distance?

192
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,020
Yes, that's why I don't talk much.

193
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,620
Gosh, he's a short-distance swimmer.

194
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,390
(Chubs)

195
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,690
Excuse me for a moment.

196
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,560
Isn't this Bok Joo who's incredibly busy?

197
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:47,160
Thank you so much for calling after missing three of my calls.

198
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,320
Where are you? Are you home already?

199
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,490
No, I'm out.

200
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,720
Was Dr. Jeong shocked yesterday?

201
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,890
- What did he say? - Good job for asking me only now.

202
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,290
I'm sure you were itching to find out.

203
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,520
Are you at school?

204
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,020
Hey.

205
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,860
Hey, Chubs!

206
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,390
Gosh!

207
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,020
Why didn't you say anything? You startled me.

208
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,590
Goodness, why did you startle me?

209
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,320
What are you doing?

210
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,520
Why did you make holes in the face of someone innocent?

211
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,420
It's because I was getting bored of waiting.

212
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,590
What did Dr. Jeong say?

213
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,620
You ask me that so early.

214
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,460
Weren't you itching to find out?

215
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,320
He probably thought that I was just crazy...

216
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,220
and stupid.

217
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,160
That's not necessarily true.

218
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,820
He was just flustered.

219
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,020
Of course he would be. He found out that his patient is...

220
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,890
a professional weightlifter.

221
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,620
He asked why you had to lie to him.

222
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,820
I made up an answer.

223
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,860
I said maybe you have a crush on someone.

224
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,890
Did you tell him who it was?

225
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,320
I have common sense, too. Why would I tell him that?

226
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,620
Does he think I'm pathetic?

227
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,890
No, I don't think so.

228
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,390
He was just flustered.

229
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,490
If I hadn't told him that I was a cellist,

230
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,860
I wouldn't have been such a crazy liar.

231
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,920
Why did I ever say that I played the cello?

232
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,490
I even went to a concert with him.

233
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,560
Watch it.

234
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,060
You were happy to go on a date with him.

235
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,460
Are you blaming me for it now?

236
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,190
You can't do that!

237
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,460
I wasn't blaming you. I was just saying.

238
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,820
What's wrong with you?

239
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,390
Have you lost your mind?

240
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,690
Why am I so unlucky?

241
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,120
I don't care about weightlifting.

242
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,060
I want to turn into a puff of smoke and disappear from Earth.

243
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,020
Turning into a puff of smoke...

244
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,690
would be impossible.

245
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,660
You weigh too much.

246
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,990
I'm sorry.

247
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,220
Being playful is becoming a habit.

248
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,620
I'll be careful from now on.

249
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,290
Do you want to go relieve stress?

250
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,990
Come on, hurry up.

251
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,690
- Let's stop. - We almost died, didn't we?

252
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,590
Bok Joo, watch me carefully.

253
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,460
I'll set a new record.

254
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,560
What do you think? No one can break my record for three years.

255
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,520
Not even...

256
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,990
a male weightlifter can break it.

257
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,290
I set another record.

258
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,820
Come on, does it hurt?

259
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:35,190
- Why doesn't it work? - Be careful.

260
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,190
- You might break your fingers. - Gosh!

261
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,990
It's not coming back up. I think it's stuck.

262
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,160
Gosh, I told you to be gentle.

263
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,490
- Why doesn't this work? - Hey, stop it.

264
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,520
- Hey, get up. - Why?

265
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,060
Be quiet. Just get up.

266
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,220
Why should I?

267
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,090
- Excuse me. Excuse me! - Run!

268
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,120
I hate running so much.

269
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,690
Why do I always run when I'm with you?

270
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,490
I'll become a track and field champion in no time.

271
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,520
You're an athlete. Shouldn't you be better at controlling your emotions?

272
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,390
What are you talking about? I still have so much stress to relieve.

273
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:19,020
Hey, do you know if there's a boxing gym nearby?

274
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,060
Are you good at boxing?

275
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,520
Bok Joo, shall we just go grab a drink?

276
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:25,920
Drink?

277
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,260
I have a feeling that I'll drink a lot if we go for drinks now.

278
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,260
(Mom)

279
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,660
- Hello? - Si Eon didn't come home yesterday.

280
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,930
It looks like she took some clothes with her, too.

281
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,790
- Hey, where are we going to sleep? - I have no idea.

282
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,960
- Goodness. - Do we have any money?

283
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,160
We have no money. Gosh, I'm annoyed.

284
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,460
- We have nothing? - None.

285
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,460
What? Did we spend it all?

286
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,060
Gosh, what does she want?

287
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,720
- What's she doing here? - I'm so annoyed.

288
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,760
Who is she?

289
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,260
Guys, don't mind her. Let's go and...

290
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,690
Don't tell Si Eon that I told you.

291
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,460
One of her friends ran away from her family.

292
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,560
She said she'd stay with her for a little while.

293
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,390
What are you doing now?

294
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,560
Gosh, why are you being like this?

295
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,720
Why do you even care? It's my life.

296
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,490
Are you saying that I should just watch you ruin your life?

297
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,990
Since when were you so interested in my life?

298
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,460
- Don't act like you care. - Just come with me.

299
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,820
Taxi.

300
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,560
Get in.

301
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,090
- Gosh, seriously. - Just get in.

302
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,790
- Hey. Open this! - Sir, please go. I don't know her.

303
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,520
Hey, Si Eon!

304
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,790
Look at the way you drink.

305
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,660
- You drink like an old man. - Shut it.

306
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,430
Right now, I can't afford to worry about how I look.

307
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,820
Hey, let me fill up your glass.

308
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,560
Yes, that's what friends are for.

309
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,930
A friend must help me let it all out when I feel like crying...

310
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,590
and let me get drunk when I want to get drunk.

311
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,090
Gosh, why does this taste so weak today?

312
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,930
This isn't enough to get me drunk.

313
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,520
Hey. Don't do that, please.

314
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,760
Hey, don't. Goodness.

315
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,720
Here. Eat this.

316
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,020
Excuse me. We'd like another bottle.

317
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,090
Excuse me!

318
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,930
(Haneol Sport University)

319
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,990
Is that you, Si Ho?

320
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,660
What are you doing alone here?

321
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,760
Nothing. I had to go somewhere.

322
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,290
I just finished my practice.

323
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,160
I'm going to play pool with my friends.

324
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,320
Well... Can I join you guys?

325
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,620
I'll just watch.

326
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,620
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

327
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,990
I keep drinking, but I'm still so sober. I'm not even tipsy.

328
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,160
I'm not sure about that. I think you're a little drunk.

329
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,260
Not at all. I'm completely sober.

330
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,120
Look at this.

331
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,890
I don't even get drunk when I'm determined to get drunk.

332
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,960
I was going to focus on my training,

333
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,620
and I got distracted by something so random.

334
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,430
The guy I like doesn't like me back.

335
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,190
The guy whom I don't like doesn't like me, either.

336
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,460
Right. Life is certainly not easy.

337
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,430
Hey, Joon Hyung.

338
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,160
Do you know when things started going wrong?

339
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,490
- The dressing table. - Dressing table?

340
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,930
My dad found it on the street and brought it.

341
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,220
If he hadn't brought it home,

342
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,760
I wouldn't have had to walk by that intersection.

343
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,090
If I hadn't walked by there, I wouldn't have met Dr. Jeong.

344
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,220
No, no. That's not really true.

345
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,320
- It's you! - Me?

346
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,120
If you weren't his brother, things wouldn't...

347
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,930
have gotten this complicated. You have to fix everything!

348
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,590
Hey, why are you blaming everything on me?

349
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,930
Did I tell you to fall for him?

350
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,090
You're right.

351
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,060
You didn't tell me to like him.

352
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,020
It's all my fault.

353
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,590
Joon Hyung. By the way,

354
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,060
do you know what really started this fate?

355
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,560
You're going to talk about fate now?

356
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,960
- What is it? - The dressing table.

357
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,360
My dad found a dressing table and brought it home.

358
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,930
If he hadn't brought it home,

359
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,560
I wouldn't have had to walk by there.

360
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,560
If I hadn't walked by there, I wouldn't have met Dr. Jeong.

361
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,620
So...

362
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,390
- you have to fix everything! - Hey, you're drunk. Let's go now.

363
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,120
- Get up. - Gosh, I'm not drunk.

364
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,790
But...

365
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,160
do you know when things started going wrong?

366
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,190
Yes. Everything was caused by either the dressing table or me.

367
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:47,690
How did you know?

368
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,920
Look at you. You're quite clever.

369
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,060
Hey, what's your IQ? Is it over 100?

370
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,520
Hey, no! Gosh!

371
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,920
Why is this girl so extreme even when she drinks?

372
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,590
I was not mentally prepared for this.

373
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,790
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

374
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,990
Fix everything, Joon Hyung.

375
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,960
You have to take responsibility for everything!

376
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,660
Hey, what more can I do?

377
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,720
You have to fix everything.

378
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,360
Fix everything...

379
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,120
Hey, you can't throw up now. Do not throw up, please!

380
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,660
Try to hold it, please.

381
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,920
Gosh, I'm cold...

382
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,690
Are you cold?

383
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,490
Look at this. Newspapers...

384
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,490
happen to be lying around right here.

385
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,220
Bok Joo.

386
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,520
This will help.

387
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,060
Why is she sleeping with her eyes open?

388
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:07,890
Gosh, Bok Joo. Let's put your hand over this.

389
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,660
This hand, too.

390
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,790
You'll learn what a difference a piece of newspaper can make.

391
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,020
Hey. Goodness.

392
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,890
Take responsibility for everything.

393
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,820
What are you talking about? I've done more than enough.

394
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,420
She passed out.

395
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,720
How can someone look like this?

396
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,420
Gosh, it's so cold.

397
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,990
Hey, Bok Joo. Bok Joo, let's go now.

398
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,060
Get up already.

399
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,660
How am I going to carry her?

400
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,060
(Plus Supermarket)

401
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,220
My mom would be so proud of me if she sees this.

402
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,660
Sir, where are we going now?

403
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,220
Wake up already, Kim Bok Joo!

404
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,720
Thank you for calling Bok Chicken.

405
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,120
Half and half? No problem. Dad, half and half!

406
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,190
How long will it take to get to your place like this?

407
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:14,190
Take responsibility for everything, Jeong Joon Hyung...

408
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,160
Enough is enough.

409
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,520
Hey. You're actually awake now, aren't you?

410
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,890
I'm getting carsick. Please drive slowly.

411
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,790
Bok Joo. You wench!

412
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,660
Goodness.

413
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,420
Be careful. Be gentle with her.

414
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,060
Yes, be really careful.

415
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,620
- Do it slowly. Be careful. - Jeong Joon Hyung...

416
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,260
You punk! I said put her down easy.

417
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:38,690
Take out the thick blanket.

418
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,460
She shouldn't be cold.

419
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,760
- My gosh. - You punk.

420
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,990
You always...

421
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,690
scold her, but you love her so dearly, don't you?

422
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,790
How much did she drink to get knocked down like this?

423
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,860
Do you think...

424
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,060
she drank with that guy alone?

425
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,790
Until a late hour like this?

426
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,890
What are you trying to say? Shut your mouth.

427
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,920
Take responsibility for everything,

428
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,190
Joon Hyung.

429
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,020
For what?

430
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,090
I'm going to kill him!

431
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,360
That little...

432
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,490
Are you saying...

433
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,660
you've done nothing...

434
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,960
- to take responsibility for? - Of course.

435
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,690
- Are you sure? - We're just friends.

436
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,190
We went to the same elementary school.

437
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,690
We all know that,

438
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,590
but you never know what will happen between a guy and a girl.

439
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,690
A friend can become a boyfriend, and a boyfriend can become a baby daddy.

440
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,060
Gosh, that won't happen.

441
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,120
We're just friends.

442
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,620
That will never happen.

443
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,560
I swear it won't happen.

444
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,790
- Do you swear? - Yes, I swear.

445
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,960
Why would you swear?

446
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,590
What's wrong with my dear Bok Joo?

447
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,090
She doesn't dress up because she's busy training,

448
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,760
but if you look at her closely, she has such a pretty face.

449
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,220
Excuse me?

450
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,220
Chang Geol. Come here for a second.

451
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,860
You sound like a psycho right now.

452
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,720
Please pick a side and stick with it.

453
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:23,990
Is that so?

454
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,220
Okay.

455
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,390
Anyway,

456
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,360
this applies not only to Bok Joo but also to you, too.

457
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,760
You're an athlete. Your body is your asset.

458
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:38,020
You shouldn't stay out late and make your friend drink.

459
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,690
You won't become the top player this way.

460
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,660
Don't you have dreams?

461
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,520
I'm sorry.

462
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,260
Are you really?

463
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,560
Yes.

464
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,920
Can I go home now?

465
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,160
Try to understand him.

466
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,360
It may not seem that way,

467
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,520
but my brother is very protective of Bok Joo.

468
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,820
She's his only daughter.

469
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,890
After his wife died young, he must've felt so bad for Bok Joo.

470
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,960
I see.

471
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,720
I'll get going, then.

472
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,860
Okay. See you later. Oh, wait.

473
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,520
Here. Take a cab with this money.

474
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,490
Bok Joo must've exhausted you.

475
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,490
No. I can take the bus.

476
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,820
It's disrespectful not to accept it.

477
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,520
Actually,

478
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,060
I'm in favor.

479
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,190
- Pardon? - I'm in favor of you two dating.

480
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,960
Let's have a drink sometime later,

481
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,520
Bok Joo's future husband.

482
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,690
No, it's not like that.

483
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,060
I'll be going now.

484
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:01,360
Gosh, l should go.

485
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,720
Joon Hyung.

486
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,620
- Yes, Jae Yi. - Where have you been?

487
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,990
I just came out to go to the supermarket.

488
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,120
You're lying.

489
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,920
Jae Yi.

490
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,990
Mom is angry, isn't she?

491
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,860
She doesn't know. I told her you came home late,

492
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,860
and you're asleep now.

493
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,160
That's good. I wasn't sure if I could take her nagging.

494
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,520
Where have you been?

495
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,060
- Were you drinking? - I didn't drink much,

496
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,690
but Bok Joo drank too much...

497
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,520
when she can't even drink and got knocked out.

498
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,490
So I took her home.

499
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,690
- Did you drink with Bok Joo alone? - Yes.

500
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,420
You should go.

501
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,720
I'll sneak in and get some sleep.

502
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,120
Okay. I'll see you.

503
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,720
You're causing all kinds of trouble these days.

504
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,960
You made me cook hangover soup for you.

505
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,390
We have tons of alcohol here.

506
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,420
Why did you go out to drink?

507
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,590
And even with a guy.

508
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,590
I'm sorry, Dad. It won't happen again.

509
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,160
Eat it slowly. I'm heating up the boiled pork.

510
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,090
It's too early to have boiled pork.

511
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,990
Sure. Having boiled pork in the morning will help me put on weight.

512
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,360
Our dear Bok Joo.

513
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,920
I actually...

514
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,860
like him as your future husband.

515
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,290
- What? - To improve the seed of our family,

516
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,520
I think we need a handsome guy like him.

517
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,590
Forget it. Nothing will happen between me and him.

518
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,790
He's already seen things he shouldn't have.

519
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,390
"He's seen..."

520
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,090
"things he shouldn't have?"

521
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,060
What are you thinking?

522
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,290
It's not like that.

523
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,190
It's fine. I can understand that.

524
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,460
We're living in the 21st century.

525
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,420
Things can happen when a grown man and a woman drink together.

526
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:10,990
You're two vigorous youths.

527
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:14,460
I'm not an old-fashioned person.

528
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,190
Just admit it.

529
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,060
I told you it's not like that. We just drank.

530
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,160
It's true.

531
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,160
Fine. I guess you're too shy.

532
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,390
Okay, then. I'll tell you first.

533
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,090
I lost my virginity when...

534
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,290
Gosh, Dad!

535
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:30,520
- I was... - Stop Uncle!

536
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,290
- Dad! - What did he do now?

537
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,660
- He's a pervert! - What did you...

538
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,290
say to her?

539
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,560
- Dad. - Eat up.

540
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,990
What time did you get home, Joon Hyung?

541
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,590
Right after you went to bed.

542
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,020
Gosh, you must've drunk a lot.

543
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,260
I can smell alcohol from your clothes.

544
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,760
Don't you know I grew up in this neighborhood?

545
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,820
Keep this up, and everyone will say my son always stays out late.

546
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,290
Gosh, Mom. I'm sorry.

547
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,920
I'm sorry, Mom. I really am.

548
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,090
My gosh. You're so sly.

549
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,320
When are you going back to school?

550
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,220
After I'm done eating. Why?

551
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,490
Your dad keeps saying he feels listless these days.

552
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,120
I was going to go and buy milk vetch roots.

553
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,060
Gosh, a daughter will be perfect for this kind of things.

554
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,920
What about you, Jae Yi? Do you have plans?

555
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,290
Yes. Ah Young is buying a stereo, and she wants me to look at it.

556
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,020
- I can cancel it, though. - Ah Young?

557
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,460
Then you should go and help her.

558
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,960
I can go to the market by myself.

559
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,960
You should go. Go and help her.

560
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,020
I'm fine.

561
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,560
- Don't forget your medicine. - Yes, Mom.

562
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:39,990
Woon Gi.

563
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,560
- Hello. - Coach Choi.

564
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,690
You punched a taxi driver? Why?

565
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:47,790
Goodness.

566
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,360
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

567
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:03,990
I'm sorry.

568
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,490
After a careful consideration, we registered our marriage...

569
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,460
and gave birth to our child.

570
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,560
I just couldn't tell you.

571
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:17,190
You're right. If it were me, I wouldn't be able to say it, too.

572
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,660
You brat.

573
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,090
You have a wife and a child.

574
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,020
Why did you hit someone? What were you thinking?

575
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,720
He swore at my wife.

576
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:30,620
- I couldn't stand it. - My gosh.

577
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,420
It looked like he's holding out thinking he hit the jackpot.

578
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,520
For now,

579
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,190
let's try to settle it with the money I got.

580
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:42,560
No, Coach. I'll figure out something and...

581
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,090
How are you going to make 3,000 dollars? Do you have money?

582
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,420
Your wife is working because you can't even afford...

583
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,520
her to stay in a postnatal care center.

584
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,820
I'll make sure...

585
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,620
to pay you back that money.

586
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,890
Of course you will.

587
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,220
- Have you named your baby yet? - We named the baby Soon Ri.

588
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,220
We wanted the baby to go with the flow and live in comfort.

589
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,830
That's a good name.

590
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,090
Hey, Soon Ri's dad.

591
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,620
If you ever keep a secret from me again,

592
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,220
I will kill you.

593
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,190
Hello? Hi, it's me.

594
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,190
It's about the money you borrowed from me before.

595
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,990
Can you pay me back this month?

596
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,190
If you're going to put it in the infirmary,

597
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,920
I think a Bluetooth stereo would be better.

598
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,260
It's more convenient.

599
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:34,990
Do you think so?

600
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:38,090
But there're so many kinds. I don't know which one to pick.

601
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,260
I think this is better than the one we saw earlier.

602
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,190
Is that so?

603
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,860
I should listen to the expert, then.

604
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:47,830
I'll take this.

605
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,390
- Okay. Please have a seat and wait. - Okay.

606
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,790
There're so many.

607
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,790
Since you recommended it,

608
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,190
you should install it, too.

609
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,460
- For free. - Gosh.

610
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:06,360
Now I know why people get conned without realizing.

611
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,520
I'll buy you an expensive meal instead.

612
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,690
Oh, by the way,

613
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,420
do you know someone named Kim Bok Joo...

614
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,390
in your school's weightlifting team?

615
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:15,890
Bok Joo?

616
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,890
She's the ace of her team. She's the tall one.

617
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,890
I mentioned a patient who asked me about Messi. Do you remember?

618
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,360
I do. You said it was memorable.

619
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,760
That patient is the student I just asked about.

620
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,720
What? That can't be true.

621
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,120
Why would a weightlifter go to a weight clinic?

622
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,790
She told me she was a cellist.

623
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,460
But I bumped into her at school.

624
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,830
That's how I found out that she does weightlifting at your school.

625
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,220
That's so strange.

626
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,520
Joon Hyung said it's because she has a crush on someone.

627
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,190
Also, Bok Joo went to elementary school with Joon Hyung.

628
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:50,220
Really? What a small world.

629
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,720
Who does she have a crush on?

630
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:57,260
She has a regular schedule, so she doesn't meet many men.

631
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,220
Does she like Joon Hyung?

632
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,830
After all, he's popular at school.

633
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,020
He's popular among many freshmen girls.

634
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,560
Is that so?

635
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,520
They seemed quite close.

636
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,760
- They drank until late last night. - Really?

637
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,330
Maybe it's him.

638
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,760
Why do I feel excited? I hope they get together.

639
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,620
Thank you, Jae Yi.

640
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:31,790
I took a lot of your time, so I'll treat you to anything you choose.

641
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,220
Tell me.

642
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,760
Do you want spaghetti or pasta?

643
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,960
My hourly rate is high. What's something that's expensive?

644
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,160
Just say what you want.

645
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,390
Bok Joo.

646
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,760
Hello, Dr. Jeong.

647
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:52,190
Bok Joo, I heard about what happened.

648
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:56,120
You caused such a big trouble. It must have been so much fun.

649
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,690
See you later.

650
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,560
You still have some time. Let's go eat together.

651
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,020
- Call Joon Hyung, too. - Excuse me?

652
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,990
No, it's okay.

653
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,960
You should join us. I wanted to treat you to a meal.

654
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,220
Let's go.

655
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,220
- Let's go. - Get in.

656
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,830
- How about a steak? - Let's eat steak.

657
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:22,890
You love meat.

658
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,790
- What else? - How about soup?

659
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:30,190
Let's order a salad for...

660
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,260
- Bok Joo. - A salad?

661
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:35,330
Right, you can eat something else.

662
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,790
How about...

663
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,920
How about this one?

664
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,920
Jae Yi, Dr. Go.

665
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,090
- Hello. - Over here, Joon Hyung.

666
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,420
Why are we meeting together?

667
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:56,120
Jae Yi set up the sound system. We met Bok Joo on our way to eat.

668
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:00,260
I didn't know you two went to the same elementary school.

669
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,420
It's not something to brag about.

670
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,920
It turns out that Bok Joo was the one...

671
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,460
who asked Jae Yi about Messi.

672
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,490
I was so surprised.

673
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:15,920
I had no idea.

674
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,860
It's a lot of food. Help yourselves.

675
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,790
Enjoy, Jae Yi. Thank you for your help.

676
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,060
Thank you for the food.

677
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:30,890
Thank you.

678
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,990
I can't help but ask questions about things I'm curious about.

679
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,020
May I ask you a question?

680
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:39,390
Do you have a crush on someone at our school?

681
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:43,330
Well, I...

682
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,660
I...

683
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,460
Stop it. You're invading her privacy.

684
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,990
Right, I'm sorry for being nosy.

685
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,420
Since when were you close to Joon Hyung?

686
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,160
I've been working at the school over a year,

687
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,490
but I had no idea.

688
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,120
We met again only recently.

689
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,860
- He's changed so much. - Really?

690
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:08,690
I bet you were surprised.

691
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,720
He used to be so small, but now he's all tall and grown up.

692
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,590
My heart would have fluttered if I were you.

693
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:19,360
Speaking of which, you two look great together.

694
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,920
Is it because they're both tall?

695
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,160
I guess so.

696
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,220
Come on, Dr. Go. You're exaggerating.

697
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,020
Do you realize how unnatural you sound?

698
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,220
No, I'm not exaggerating.

699
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:34,220
- You two look great together. - Come on.

700
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,330
Let's stop talking and eat. The food is getting cold.

701
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:37,690
- Let's eat. - Okay.

702
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,660
Are you telling me to shut it and eat? Fine.

703
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:42,090
Come On.

704
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,190
Here you go.

705
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,160
- What? - It's a rib.

706
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:49,390
- It's so delicious. - Here you go.

707
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:53,490
Here's one for you, Bok Joo.

708
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:54,830
It's okay.

709
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,920
- Please take one. - Here.

710
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:00,890
Here you go.

711
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,720
Enjoy.

712
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,760
You have to try it.

713
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:06,690
Look how meaty it is.

714
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:08,790
Eat it with the pasta.

715
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:12,460
- Try it. - You like this, don't you?

716
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,490
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

717
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:22,020
Thank you for the food.

718
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:25,360
You helped me today, so I'll give you a ride.

719
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,560
Do you want a ride, too? I can drop you off.

720
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:32,590
- It's okay. We can walk. - Okay.

721
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:35,420
You'll look great walking together.

722
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:38,920
- See you later. - Take care. See you again, Bok Joo.

723
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:50,890
Dr. Go's assumption was wrong, don't you think?

724
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,220
That's not important.

725
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,420
It doesn't matter.

726
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,520
Come to think of it,

727
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,560
it turned out for the better.

728
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,790
What do you mean?

729
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:21,490
The lunch we had today.

730
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,790
I felt uncomfortable about how we parted last time.

731
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,720
Now, I feel like things came to a close.

732
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,860
All I have to do is concentrate on my competition.

733
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:37,520
Can you get ready for the competition when you sound so weak?

734
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,220
That's true.

735
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,020
Why do I feel so listless and empty?

736
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:46,620
I'm not sure.

737
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:54,330
By the way, Dr. Go and Dr. Jeong looked great together.

738
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,760
They seemed close.

739
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:59,160
It's because they're colleagues from medical school.

740
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,420
They're on the same level.

741
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,990
Dr. Go is pretty.

742
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:05,390
She has a great personality, and she's a doctor.

743
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,690
You're good, too.

744
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,520
You're healthy.

745
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,990
Is that supposed to make me feel better? You're terrible.

746
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,390
Do you want to eat something?

747
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,020
We just had lunch.

748
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,990
I don't eat all the time.

749
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:22,990
How about...

750
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,990
watching a movie?

751
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,620
Or go to a club?

752
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,660
How about a drive to the sea?

753
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:32,860
Can you drive?

754
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,190
- Do you have a car? - I have a car that isn't mine.

755
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:38,330
It won't take long to get to the sea.

756
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:44,520
No, it's too far away. Forget it.

757
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,160
Come on, let's go to the sea.

758
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,160
You lose if you don't, rock-paper-scissors.

759
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,460
Let's go.

760
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:56,990
- Can we go? - Yes, we can.

761
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:09,020
Hey, you look very aggressive.

762
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,390
Do you want to get in?

763
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:20,330
Isn't this Dr. Jeong's...

764
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:21,830
It is, but it's also mine.

765
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:23,720
I've been driving it secretly for some years.

766
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,390
I have the emergency key. I'm sure Jae Yi knows that I drive it.

767
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,860
Can you drive well?

768
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,390
Of course, I'm the best driver.

769
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:34,260
Where's the seat belt?

770
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,220
Put on the seat belt.

771
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:41,590
- I wonder if this is okay. - Okay.

772
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,590
To come back by midnight, we don't have much time.

773
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:47,220
Hold on tight. There won't be any turning back.

774
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,620
What do you think? Don't I drive well?

775
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,690
You drive like a beginner. I'm getting motion sickness.

776
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:11,920
It's perfect how it keeps me alert.

777
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,560
This is all a strategy.

778
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,360
It's hard to pretend like I'm bad at driving.

779
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,360
Either way, it's good to be out.

780
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,920
Aren't you glad that you listened to me?

781
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:26,520
Do you regret...

782
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:28,720
lying to Jae Yi about weightlifting?

783
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:33,360
No.

784
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,220
Even if I were to go back in time,

785
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,090
I would have lied again.

786
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,890
Why? Aren't you proud of your weightlifting?

787
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:44,490
What's wrong with a woman who does weightlifting?

788
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:48,020
Of course, I'm very proud of myself...

789
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:51,090
as a professional weightlifter.

790
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:53,360
A woman who does weightlifting...

791
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:57,620
may be impressive, but she isn't exactly beautiful.

792
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,220
What's the difference?

793
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:02,990
Here's the difference.

794
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:06,420
The senior female weightlifters who have boyfriends...

795
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,720
don't usually invite their boyfriends to competitions.

796
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,460
We lift heavy lumps of metal.

797
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,720
In that moment,

798
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:16,490
we can't help but show our veins popping out,

799
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:20,020
our faces getting red, our double or triple chins,

800
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:23,090
and our belly fat sticking out from the belt. It's so ugly.

801
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,120
We say that our looks aren't everything.

802
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,860
Being dedicated to achieving our dream is...

803
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,160
more important.

804
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:34,520
However, it's not something we want to show to the guy we like.

805
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,490
So in some ways,

806
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,490
choosing to be a weightlifter...

807
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:46,490
might mean that I have to...

808
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:49,220
give up living as a woman to a certain extent.

809
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:50,720
That's what I've been thinking.

810
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,960
That is complete nonsense.

811
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:57,260
You just have to meet a guy who can even love that about you.

812
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:00,220
It's easier said than done. It's hard to find a guy like that.

813
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:03,260
Hey, they exist. Take me for an example...

814
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,220
Hey, did you see those seagulls over there?

815
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,590
There's a flock of them. Did you see?

816
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,160
- Over there. Oh, my. - I have to look straight ahead.

817
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,620
Do you want to do that thing?

818
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,390
What's it called? The boat where you can...

819
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:14,720
feed seagulls. Is this off-season for it?

820
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,790
Hey, I have to drive. I can't look around right now.

821
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:18,360
You haven't done it? You're so lame.

822
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,660
- What a loser. - Choose between seagulls and me.

823
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,820
Seagulls.

824
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,660
Let me ask you one last time. Seagulls or me?

825
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:26,690
Hey.

826
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:28,120
Do you want to go for barbecue?

827
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:38,060
Look at the ocean! The sea breeze feels so nice.

828
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,520
Hi, seagulls!

829
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,520
Have you never been to a beach or what? Stop acting so lame.

830
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:47,160
I've been so stressed out, but being here has totally refreshed me.

831
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:50,120
I should really be here with a boyfriend.

832
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:51,820
It'd be so romantic to play silly games...

833
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:53,220
and write each other's names in the sand.

834
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,420
Hey, aren't you a little too old for that?

835
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,290
You're so immature.

836
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,090
Grow up already, will you?

837
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:01,420
Hey.

838
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,590
- Hey, hey! - Try and catch me!

839
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,790
You!

840
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:06,860
Hey, Joon Hyung!

841
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,190
I need head support. Let me use your arm.

842
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:40,420
Chubs, is it because you lift heavy weights?

843
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:41,760
Even your head is heavy.

844
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,920
Get a taste of this.

845
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,160
I actually tasted death.

846
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:47,520
It was for fun. Why did you have to get all feisty?

847
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:50,090
You know how competitive I can be.

848
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:51,920
You're actually a pretty good runner.

849
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,960
I ran away to survive.

850
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:55,290
You little...

851
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:01,860
I've shown you all sorts of things.

852
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:03,720
How did this happen?

853
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:05,860
So? Do you think it's unfair?

854
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:08,120
Of course I do.

855
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:10,190
I've told you everything about me,

856
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:12,020
but all I know about you is your trauma.

857
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,320
I don't know anything else.

858
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:15,220
Okay!

859
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,690
Then I'll tell you something, too.

860
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,560
When we were in elementary school...

861
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,920
Ouch! Who pulled my hair?

862
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,360
Whose chocolate is this?

863
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:41,020
- I don't know. - What is it?

864
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,890
I'll eat it if it doesn't belong to anyone!

865
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,220
- Okay! - Go ahead.

866
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,960
- Can I really eat it? - Yes!

867
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:56,890
Someone used to put chocolates and candies on your desk, right?

868
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:00,120
It was me.

869
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,560
Seriously?

870
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:03,390
Did you have a crush on me?

871
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,260
Goodness, you're overreacting again.

872
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,420
You saved my life, you know.

873
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:09,660
I wanted to thank you.

874
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,090
I also thought you were cool.

875
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,060
You know how timid I used to be back then.

876
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,420
But you got along with other kids so well,

877
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:20,620
and you were always brave...

878
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,290
and strong.

879
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:24,560
That was nothing special.

880
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:26,590
It wasn't even a big secret.

881
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:28,860
You want something bigger?

882
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:32,020
Gosh, I thought it was a pretty big secret.

883
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:36,060
Then I'll let you in on a huge secret.

884
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,960
Yes, please. Tell me everything.

885
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:41,390
It's about Jae Yi.

886
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:46,760
He's not really my brother.

887
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,490
He's actually my cousin.

888
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,060
The people whom I call my parents now are actually my uncle and aunt.

889
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:58,120
When my mom got remarried,

890
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,220
she left me with my uncle and aunt.

891
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,820
Then she moved to Canada.

892
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:08,090
Is that why you transferred to a different school all of a sudden?

893
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:09,920
That's what happened.

894
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:13,760
I couldn't even say goodbye to you.

895
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:17,260
Hey.

896
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:19,860
Don't give me that pitiful look.

897
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:21,860
It wasn't too bad.

898
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,120
My uncle and aunt have been so good to me,

899
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,560
and Jae Yi couldn't have been any sweeter to me.

900
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,590
You see, my personality has changed so much.

901
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,360
I wouldn't have changed like this if I had an unhappy childhood.

902
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,220
You know,

903
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,320
everyone keeps...

904
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,690
a few painful wounds buried in his or her heart.

905
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:47,920
If they can move on, it's great.

906
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,260
Even if they can't, they still live.

907
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,290
They become numb to the pain with time.

908
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:55,620
You'll be fine soon, too.

909
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:58,560
You're right.

910
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,990
I already feel much better than earlier.

911
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:04,960
You have a match in two weeks, right?

912
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,960
Tackle what's in front of you first,

913
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,090
then just wait.

914
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:13,320
Time will take care of everything.

915
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,760
One good thing about having a crush on someone...

916
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:28,360
is that I get to decide when to end it.

917
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:33,190
My feelings have been out of my control,

918
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,960
but I've decided to tame my heart as of today.

919
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:40,820
You've been a good sport, my heart.

920
00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:42,920
You were definitely...

921
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,760
passionate enough.

922
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:54,520
(D-7 to the tournament)

923
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,520
Good, you're doing great.

924
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,620
Flex your stomach. Flex! More.

925
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:01,120
Keep going.

926
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:03,890
The gold medal goes to Kim Bok Joo!

927
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:05,020
Gold medal!

928
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:09,960
(D-6 to the tournament)

929
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:19,790
(D-5 to the tournament)

930
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:23,420
- I'd love it if you can gain more. - This is good, Bok Joo.

931
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,260
Keep up the great work, okay?

932
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,720
(D-4 to the tournament)

933
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:36,660
(An adequate amount of effort is never enough.)

934
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:42,590
(D-3 to the tournament)

935
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,960
Here it comes. Eat this, too. Eat up.

936
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,920
Oh, there's more. There's one more dish.

937
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:05,720
(The day before the tournament)

938
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:09,490
Hey, you did it.

939
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,760
This is good enough. Professor, look.

940
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,860
See? I knew it.

941
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,290
I told you that it had to be Bok Joo.

942
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:16,820
You just have to maintain your condition.

943
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:19,520
I have really good instincts!

944
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,260
Isn't the tournament today?

945
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:27,520
Yes.

946
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:29,490
Good luck.

947
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,090
I really mean it.

948
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,220
Oh, no. I have to wear this today.

949
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,760
What should I do?

950
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,320
I knew that you'd be here, Bok Joo.

951
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,060
Hey, you.

952
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,820
How are you feeling? Do you feel ready?

953
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,960
No, I feel horrible.

954
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:11,460
I think I'll be terrible today.

955
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,860
I even spilled my protein shake on my lucky shirt this morning.

956
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:14,960
I'm getting a bad feeling.

957
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:17,060
What if I make a mistake?

958
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:19,660
Bok Joo.

959
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:22,490
The ace of Haneol's weightlifting team.

960
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,560
You won't make any mistakes.

961
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:29,590
You've been training so hard, and you're such a strong person.

962
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,520
Not everyone gets to be the ace, you know.

963
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,660
All right, then. Go get on the bus now.

964
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,060
I'll be there later to cheer you.

965
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:41,460
All right.

966
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:42,690
Go!

967
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:45,560
Go, Bok Joo!

968
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,290
I'm rooting for you!

969
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:51,690
You need to march triumphantly.

970
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:53,560
You're going there to win.

971
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,120
It's new. Why is it breaking already?

972
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:02,120
- Did we get scammed? - It was working fine.

973
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,290
Did you not plug this in properly?

974
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:07,090
Hey, do you think I'm an idiot?

975
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,890
That's the first thing I checked.

976
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,160
I tried pressing all the buttons, but I just can't get it to work.

977
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:17,960
Oh, the power bar.

978
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,490
I didn't think to check that.

979
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:22,660
It works fine.

980
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:24,660
Do you want to grab food with me?

981
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:26,960
No, I have to visit Dr. Kang's new clinic.

982
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,020
Are you going, too?

983
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:31,090
No, I'm working the night shift today.

984
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:33,960
The other doctor has to work at a weightlifting match today.

985
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,590
Is there a weightlifting match today?

986
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:40,190
Bok Joo will compete, too. It's at the Olympic Stadium.

987
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:42,360
Isn't Dr. Kang's hospital near there?

988
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,120
Yes. I think so.

989
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:51,390
(2016 National Weightlifting Championship)

990
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:52,460
Go, Woon Gi!

991
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:53,720
- Let's go! - Let's go!

992
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,090
- Yes! - You can do it!

993
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,560
Woon Gi! Just go with the flow!

994
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:01,390
Let's go!

995
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:25,820
The judges agree...

996
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:27,860
it's a success.

997
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:33,560
Bok Joo.

998
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:36,390
- It's time. - Break a leg, Bok Joo.

999
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:39,090
Be calm, and do it as you always do.

1000
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:44,290
The next contestant is...

1001
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:46,390
Kim Bok Joo from Haneol Sport University.

1002
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:49,420
It's her third and final attempt in the clean and jerk.

1003
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,190
That's right, Bok Joo.

1004
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:55,160
Everything depends on this one shot.

1005
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,790
Don't be nervous.

1006
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:59,420
You're strong.

1007
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:01,420
You can do this.

1008
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:05,220
Don't doubt yourself. Just focus on the barbell now.

1009
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,520
Dr. Jeong?

1010
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,520
- You can do it, Bok Joo! - Let's go!

1011
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:05,520
Bok Joo.

1012
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:07,920
What are you doing, Bok Joo? Get in there now.

1013
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:32,920
We lift heavy lumps of metal.

1014
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,290
In that moment, we can't help...

1015
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,690
but show our veins popping out, our faces getting red,

1016
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:40,520
our double or triple chin,

1017
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:44,390
and our belly fat sticking out from the belt. It's so ugly.

1018
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,260
It's not something we want to show to the guy we like.

1019
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:11,390
What is it? What happened?

1020
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,160
(Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo)

1021
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,390
Why can't you see that your consideration...

1022
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:50,720
for others can hurt their feelings?

1023
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,920
I hope I didn't hurt your feelings.

1024
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,560
I see. If I like someone, he won't like me back.

1025
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,090
It puts him in a difficult position.

1026
00:59:58,090 --> 01:00:00,420
Who would think you're pretty when you're so embarrassed of yourself?

1027
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:03,390
Have you seen Bok Joo? She suddenly disappeared.

1028
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:04,820
- What's the matter with you? - Joon Hyung.

1029
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:07,090
Why do you keep making me feel uneasy?

1030
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:09,090
Why do you make me worry about you, Bok Joo?
