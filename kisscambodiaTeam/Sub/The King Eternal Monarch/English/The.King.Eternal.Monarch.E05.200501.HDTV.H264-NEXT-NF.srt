00:00:00,055 --> 00:00:04,711
THE KING: ETERNAL MONARCH

2
00:00:04,813 --> 00:00:06,274
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:06,383 --> 00:00:07,713
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:15,837
JEONG TAE-EUL

5
00:00:15,921 --> 00:00:17,714
<i>I'm bored, let's play pool.</i>

6
00:00:22,177 --> 00:00:24,638
EPISODE 5

7
00:00:27,557 --> 00:00:28,642
Thank you for your kindness.

8
00:00:29,226 --> 00:00:30,936
I should repay you in cash,

9
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,814
but our worlds had different bills,
so I got you goods instead.

10
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:39,569
I hope you can get a satisfactory price.

11
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:46,451
Where did you get this?

12
00:00:46,535 --> 00:00:48,537
Did you find oil in your yard
or something?

13
00:00:56,711 --> 00:00:57,712
Oh, Sin-jae.

14
00:00:57,796 --> 00:00:59,464
Can I get a sweet milk tea?

15
00:01:01,424 --> 00:01:02,759
I guess Squad Three is off duty tomorrow.

16
00:01:02,843 --> 00:01:04,678
Yes, I was thinking of playing pool.

17
00:01:05,929 --> 00:01:07,764
I don't see the horse that was here.

18
00:01:07,848 --> 00:01:10,100
Maximus? It's been gone for a while.

19
00:01:13,186 --> 00:01:16,439
Everyone's been asking,
so I even wrote it on the sign out front.

20
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:24,322
But Tae-eul isn't here.

21
00:01:25,365 --> 00:01:26,700
Who are you playing pool with?

22
00:01:27,993 --> 00:01:30,245
-She's not here?
-Maybe she's back.

23
00:01:31,663 --> 00:01:33,498
She left with that King guy a while ago.

24
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:38,795
THE HORSE ISN'T HERE

25
00:01:46,303 --> 00:01:48,930
I'M BORED, LET'S PLAY POOL

26
00:01:50,807 --> 00:01:51,975
<i>Head Court Lady Noh, it's me.</i>

27
00:01:53,018 --> 00:01:55,645
<i>His Majesty just came back,
and he has a guest.</i>

28
00:01:58,815 --> 00:01:59,900
It's a woman.

29
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:03,737
Tell His Majesty to take a detour,

30
00:02:04,487 --> 00:02:05,822
and use the sea route.

31
00:02:06,907 --> 00:02:09,159
He shouldn't be seen by people.

32
00:02:10,368 --> 00:02:12,829
Don't worry about the palace,
I'll make sure nobody talks.

33
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,214
FOUR TIGER SWORD

34
00:02:34,392 --> 00:02:36,269
I'm the King of the Kingdom of Corea.

35
00:02:39,064 --> 00:02:41,066
And my name, which you cannot say,

36
00:02:44,527 --> 00:02:45,612
is Lee Gon.

37
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,704
So

38
00:02:56,414 --> 00:02:57,499
you do have a name.

39
00:03:01,753 --> 00:03:03,713
If you really have a name,

40
00:03:05,715 --> 00:03:07,926
I guess there's no way
to avoid a beheading now.

41
00:03:11,221 --> 00:03:14,683
From the way you talked to me so far,
it's only right to behead you right away.

42
00:03:20,855 --> 00:03:23,108
-I'll escort you to the palace.
-Let me take care of Maximus first.

43
00:03:24,192 --> 00:03:26,027
The trip had been too long for her age.

44
00:03:27,028 --> 00:03:28,321
Come to the racetracks.

45
00:03:33,284 --> 00:03:35,620
Withdraw the guards from the racetracks
right now.

46
00:03:35,954 --> 00:03:38,081
Two of you go to the control room
and get the security footage.

47
00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:39,082
The rest, follow me.

48
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:07,235
What is this place?

49
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:10,697
Is it some kind of a fourth dimension?

50
00:04:11,614 --> 00:04:13,158
I'm not sure yet.

51
00:04:13,742 --> 00:04:17,078
I guess we can say it's something between
1 and 0 in my world and yours.

52
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:21,124
This is a place that cannot be
explained scientifically.

53
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:27,213
Do you see that balloon?

54
00:04:28,548 --> 00:04:31,009
Balloons usually pop within ten hours.

55
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:34,387
But that one has been floating
like that for over ten days.

56
00:04:35,346 --> 00:04:37,515
It hasn't popped or floated away.

57
00:04:38,683 --> 00:04:40,226
It's exactly where I let it go.

58
00:04:41,227 --> 00:04:44,731
That means there's no light,
wind or air here.

59
00:04:45,648 --> 00:04:46,649
Isn't that amazing?

60
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:48,610
If it's not science, what is it?

61
00:04:49,652 --> 00:04:52,280
Is it some kind of magic?

62
00:04:52,572 --> 00:04:55,366
It could be a part of a legend.

63
00:04:57,243 --> 00:04:58,995
Time flows differently here as well.

64
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:01,748
One minute here is about an hour outside.

65
00:05:02,499 --> 00:05:04,000
My watch stops here,

66
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:05,752
so I went back and forth
for several days to check.

67
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:10,632
How could you check when clocks stop here?

68
00:05:10,965 --> 00:05:12,634
I used Euler's number.

69
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:17,639
I don't know how deep

70
00:05:19,224 --> 00:05:21,142
or how vast this place is.

71
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:24,687
I'll reach the edge of this place someday.

72
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:26,356
And I'll tell you

73
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,274
all about it.

74
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:30,485
But for today, let's go to my world.

75
00:05:44,874 --> 00:05:47,919
Lady Maximus has a lower blood pressure
than last time,

76
00:05:48,002 --> 00:05:51,506
but it's still within a normal range.

77
00:05:52,382 --> 00:05:53,424
"Lady"?

78
00:05:55,885 --> 00:05:57,345
A horse is called a lady...

79
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,390
I will do another thorough checkup
in the morning, Your Majesty.

80
00:06:01,057 --> 00:06:02,142
Please do.

81
00:06:12,902 --> 00:06:15,613
I told you so. Everything I said to you
was true, wasn't it?

82
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:19,784
Don't you see that's driving me crazy?

83
00:06:20,618 --> 00:06:22,829
If this is all real, it's terrifying.

84
00:06:23,621 --> 00:06:25,790
And if it's not, that means I'm crazy.

85
00:06:25,874 --> 00:06:27,083
You should watch your manners.

86
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:28,793
And that face.

87
00:06:28,877 --> 00:06:30,378
He is supposed to be on my side.

88
00:06:30,962 --> 00:06:32,630
He's been on my side since I was three.

89
00:06:35,884 --> 00:06:37,260
Is that gun real?

90
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:39,304
Can I take a look at it?

91
00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:46,644
She knows how to handle it. Let her be.

92
00:06:47,437 --> 00:06:49,439
She has to see for herself to believe it.

93
00:06:49,522 --> 00:06:50,690
Believe what?

94
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:53,109
That she just crossed between 1 and 0.

95
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:04,704
No way.

96
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:07,290
This is real?

97
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:09,417
This P30

98
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:11,961
is actually real?

99
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:16,674
I'm going to check something.

100
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,177
It's nothing personal.

101
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:32,815
I told you. She can handle guns.

102
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,485
I'm letting this go just this once
because you're His Majesty's guest.

103
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:38,363
So...

104
00:07:38,947 --> 00:07:39,989
This country...

105
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,991
And you being the King.

106
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:44,369
It's all real?

107
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:45,954
It's all real.

108
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,458
That gun, this world, and me.

109
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:53,920
So don't think of confirming that
by pulling the trigger.

110
00:07:54,796 --> 00:07:58,216
This guy isn't going to move an inch.

111
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:01,010
Loosen your grip

112
00:08:01,844 --> 00:08:03,179
unless you want to get killed.

113
00:08:19,862 --> 00:08:20,822
Your Majesty, is she...

114
00:08:20,905 --> 00:08:21,906
Yes.

115
00:08:22,991 --> 00:08:24,409
She's Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

116
00:08:27,161 --> 00:08:28,121
Do you

117
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:29,872
know me as well?

118
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:54,897
Welcome to my palace.

119
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,997
This is Gwangyeongjeon.

120
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:12,582
It's my private residence.

121
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:15,084
Make yourself at home...

122
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:21,841
Did you really have to do this?

123
00:09:22,425 --> 00:09:25,261
Are you trying to worry me to death?

124
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:27,221
Head Court Lady Noh...

125
00:09:27,972 --> 00:09:30,141
I think it has only been
about 10 minutes and 50 seconds

126
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:32,352
since she believed I'm a king.

127
00:09:35,229 --> 00:09:36,814
She's the important person who knows

128
00:09:37,565 --> 00:09:38,941
where the buttons came from.

129
00:09:41,944 --> 00:09:44,238
It's nice to meet you. I'm--

130
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:48,368
Put all your belongings here in the box.

131
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:54,624
Everyone has to go through
a security check when entering the palace.

132
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,419
Everyone including the court ladies
and even the Prime Minister.

133
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:05,593
You reap what you sow.

134
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,359
You're giving them back
to me later, right?

135
00:10:21,818 --> 00:10:24,570
I'll be penalized
if I lose my ID card again.

136
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:29,534
You recognize her face, right?

137
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,370
You're right.

138
00:10:35,623 --> 00:10:38,084
Do I have to get frisked now?

139
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:39,669
We'll skip that.

140
00:10:40,294 --> 00:10:41,546
I should trust you.

141
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,965
You're my King's guest.

142
00:10:47,802 --> 00:10:49,762
Let me talk to you for a moment.

143
00:10:50,263 --> 00:10:51,222
Now?

144
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:57,478
I'm sure you want to talk later.

145
00:10:58,104 --> 00:11:01,607
But I also would have liked it
if you had left the palace later

146
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:07,029
and brought a guest according
to the right procedures later.

147
00:11:07,113 --> 00:11:11,784
There were five guards and one person
at the stable who saw her.

148
00:11:11,868 --> 00:11:15,329
Twelve court ladies who would be
suspicious of being

149
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:16,998
-dismissed suddenly--
-I was on my way.

150
00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:20,960
I needed to talk now anyway.

151
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:27,133
You should leave, too.

152
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,260
It's a King's order.

153
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:40,021
Don't worry.

154
00:11:40,688 --> 00:11:41,981
Just wait here.

155
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:45,151
I'll ditch her somehow and come back.

156
00:11:45,234 --> 00:11:47,695
My goodness...

157
00:11:48,905 --> 00:11:50,198
You're really asking for it, aren't you?

158
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:55,786
I mean,

159
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,539
Your Highness.

160
00:12:04,086 --> 00:12:05,630
I guess that was the wrong thing to say.

161
00:12:08,716 --> 00:12:10,051
She really believes it now.

162
00:12:11,928 --> 00:12:13,346
That I'm the King.

163
00:12:24,273 --> 00:12:26,067
My goodness, my head.

164
00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:27,860
Oh, my heart.

165
00:12:28,903 --> 00:12:30,154
My goodness.

166
00:13:06,691 --> 00:13:10,236
You have a meeting at 8 a.m.
regarding the 25th anniversary

167
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:12,029
of your coronation with the staff.

168
00:13:12,363 --> 00:13:15,950
And you have an appointment for tea
at 10 a.m. with press company CEOs,

169
00:13:16,117 --> 00:13:18,202
then you must make the first throw
at the basketball

170
00:13:18,286 --> 00:13:19,620
season-opening ceremony at 1 p.m.

171
00:13:19,704 --> 00:13:20,663
Hang on.

172
00:13:20,746 --> 00:13:23,249
I left the palace for just half a day,

173
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,209
and I have that many things to do?

174
00:13:25,793 --> 00:13:28,754
Maybe someone in the court
has a grudge on you.

175
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:33,134
-Is there more?
-Yes.

176
00:13:33,634 --> 00:13:35,511
You have a speech to deliver at 2 p.m.

177
00:13:35,595 --> 00:13:37,054
at the International Congress of
Mathematicians.

178
00:13:37,138 --> 00:13:40,474
Then there is a flood relief supply
delivery ceremony at 4 p.m.

179
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:42,476
You can go there by helicopter.

180
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,644
All right.

181
00:13:44,061 --> 00:13:45,313
I'll do all that,

182
00:13:45,396 --> 00:13:47,189
so please let me eat dinner freely.

183
00:13:47,607 --> 00:13:51,152
It's always suspicious
when you do something on your own.

184
00:13:51,235 --> 00:13:52,862
You're crossing the line now.

185
00:13:53,738 --> 00:13:55,448
I'll be eating by myself in the study.

186
00:13:56,449 --> 00:13:57,575
Alone.

187
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:02,997
<i>There is a guest in His Majesty's study.</i>

188
00:14:03,831 --> 00:14:05,875
<i>You must keep that guest</i>

189
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,919
<i>locked up in there
until I give other orders.</i>

190
00:14:26,771 --> 00:14:28,189
Ironically, my first duty as a king

191
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:30,566
was to carry out
the funeral of the former king.

192
00:14:31,192 --> 00:14:32,234
It was when I was eight.

193
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,292
I'm positive now

194
00:14:49,377 --> 00:14:50,544
that it's a parallel universe.

195
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:53,547
Pardon?

196
00:14:54,924 --> 00:14:56,008
Na-ri.

197
00:14:57,677 --> 00:14:58,552
Myeong Na-ri.

198
00:14:58,636 --> 00:15:00,513
Who's Myeong Na-ri?

199
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:04,642
I'm Myeong Seung-a
from the Royal Public Affairs Office.

200
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:17,238
I know it won't be true,

201
00:15:17,863 --> 00:15:19,532
but I just want to make sure.

202
00:15:20,491 --> 00:15:21,867
Don't you own a building?

203
00:15:22,451 --> 00:15:24,870
Didn't you rent it out
to a Taekwondo center?

204
00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:31,127
I do own buildings,
but they're all in Canada.

205
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,255
Would you like some tea?

206
00:15:34,338 --> 00:15:36,132
It's herb tea that will help you
have a good night's sleep.

207
00:15:40,261 --> 00:15:42,805
You want me to fall asleep?

208
00:15:43,097 --> 00:15:44,390
I'd be grateful if you could.

209
00:15:44,473 --> 00:15:46,517
I came here to keep an eye on you,

210
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,104
and you won't be able to leave
until Head Court Lady Noh says otherwise.

211
00:15:50,187 --> 00:15:52,314
It will be easy for both of us
if you sleep.

212
00:15:54,525 --> 00:15:56,235
You're really straightforward,

213
00:15:57,445 --> 00:15:59,071
just like Na-ri.

214
00:16:01,323 --> 00:16:02,199
I...

215
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,162
Can I use that laptop over there?

216
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:09,206
Of course not. You can't use His Majesty's
laptop without his permission.

217
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:15,504
-It's the year 2019 here, right?
-Yes.

218
00:16:15,588 --> 00:16:18,382
And was this room's owner born in 1987?

219
00:16:18,966 --> 00:16:19,967
Of course.

220
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,595
And the cultural capital is Busan,

221
00:16:22,678 --> 00:16:25,097
and there are 63 buildings
called 63 Building.

222
00:16:25,181 --> 00:16:26,974
There's only one 63 Building
in Yeouido, Seoul.

223
00:16:27,057 --> 00:16:27,892
That little jerk.

224
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:30,895
Did you just swear at me?

225
00:16:34,106 --> 00:16:37,485
What would be the better answer?

226
00:16:42,156 --> 00:16:44,742
Can I have alcohol instead of tea?

227
00:16:45,493 --> 00:16:47,578
I'd love some soju.

228
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:53,876
<i>Your Majesty, where did you go this time?</i>

229
00:16:55,503 --> 00:16:56,378
A parallel universe.

230
00:17:23,531 --> 00:17:24,740
Why do you need a laptop?

231
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:29,036
I wanted to look some stuff up
on the internet.

232
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,751
It's a business phone,
so I can't lend it to you.

233
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:38,963
But if you tell me,
I'll read out the search results for you.

234
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,507
I guess that will work.

235
00:17:44,343 --> 00:17:45,302
All right. Then...

236
00:17:46,303 --> 00:17:47,179
Lee Gon.

237
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:52,101
What did you just say?

238
00:17:52,184 --> 00:17:53,477
Lee Gon.

239
00:17:54,103 --> 00:17:56,689
Isn't the King's name Lee Gon?

240
00:17:56,772 --> 00:17:57,731
Have you lost your mind?

241
00:17:58,399 --> 00:18:01,026
Are you just casually
calling the King's name like that?

242
00:18:02,403 --> 00:18:06,073
You don't even know the 63 Building,
and you don't know the King's age.

243
00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:10,744
Who in the world are you?

244
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:13,497
Oh, did you live abroad for a long time?

245
00:18:14,164 --> 00:18:15,583
But even so,

246
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,835
how could you be so indifferent
toward your home country?

247
00:18:18,586 --> 00:18:19,753
Well...

248
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,756
This isn't my home country.

249
00:18:24,258 --> 00:18:28,762
Well, my earth is still flat for me
so I can't explain.

250
00:18:30,639 --> 00:18:32,308
Let's just say I'm an illegal immigrant.

251
00:18:34,435 --> 00:18:35,477
Oh, my gosh.

252
00:18:43,694 --> 00:18:45,404
Can you leave us? It won't take long.

253
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:54,830
She's an illegal immigrant.

254
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:01,962
Why are you smiling?

255
00:19:02,046 --> 00:19:04,924
I know someone who looks like you,
but you're so different from him.

256
00:19:05,257 --> 00:19:06,258
I'm sorry about earlier.

257
00:19:07,635 --> 00:19:09,845
But were you always like this?

258
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,098
So prudent and serious?

259
00:19:14,058 --> 00:19:15,100
Hold this.

260
00:19:16,185 --> 00:19:18,771
I understand how you feel.
I went through that too.

261
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:37,122
I thought you'd need it,
so I made it easy for you.

262
00:19:37,331 --> 00:19:38,916
I'm sure you won't find anything, though.

263
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:42,711
You can ask your boss why.

264
00:19:42,962 --> 00:19:45,422
He's a science guy,
so he'd be better at explaining.

265
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:50,386
Are you

266
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:53,973
from a parallel universe?

267
00:19:54,723 --> 00:19:56,016
Where the capital is Seoul,

268
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:59,186
and the country's name
is the Republic of Korea?

269
00:20:00,938 --> 00:20:02,314
How do you know that?

270
00:20:07,027 --> 00:20:08,070
Who are you?

271
00:20:09,363 --> 00:20:11,240
What have you done to His Majesty?

272
00:20:12,616 --> 00:20:14,868
Did you make that weird scar
on his shoulder too?

273
00:20:15,452 --> 00:20:17,663
He has a scar on his shoulder?

274
00:20:20,457 --> 00:20:22,584
I don't know anything about that.

275
00:20:23,836 --> 00:20:25,462
We're not close enough to show
each other's backs.

276
00:20:26,255 --> 00:20:29,216
And don't talk to me like that.

277
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:31,802
You were born in 1991, right?
I'm a year older than you.

278
00:20:36,432 --> 00:20:37,599
Captain Jo.

279
00:20:57,411 --> 00:20:59,663
I said I wanted the halls empty.

280
00:21:04,293 --> 00:21:05,753
Your Majesty, I wanted to ask a few--

281
00:21:05,836 --> 00:21:08,630
I know. I know you're curious

282
00:21:08,714 --> 00:21:10,966
and I understand why you want
to check her fingerprints.

283
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,676
I'll send you a link.

284
00:21:12,968 --> 00:21:14,595
It's about quantum mechanics.

285
00:21:14,678 --> 00:21:17,347
Send me your questions by text
after reading it.

286
00:21:17,431 --> 00:21:21,268
And will you open the door now?
The food is getting cold.

287
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:23,979
But Your Majesty.

288
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,774
Didn't you get any alcohol?

289
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:31,070
Your guest was asking for some.

290
00:21:33,864 --> 00:21:34,907
Yeong.

291
00:21:35,032 --> 00:21:35,949
Yes, Your Majesty.

292
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:40,079
Will you find out where the alcohol fridge
is located in the palace?

293
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,081
Pardon?

294
00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:48,003
By the way,

295
00:21:48,837 --> 00:21:50,672
when do you think His Majesty saw me?

296
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:53,258
I greeted him,

297
00:21:54,134 --> 00:21:57,054
but he said we'd met before
and that he was glad to see me.

298
00:21:59,098 --> 00:22:00,432
I had never met him before.

299
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,271
Was there anything notable
about the woman in there?

300
00:22:06,396 --> 00:22:08,607
-Except that she asked for alcohol.
-You shouldn't ask me.

301
00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:11,235
I'm only going to report
to Head Court Lady Noh.

302
00:22:14,363 --> 00:22:15,364
You're good at your job.

303
00:22:15,447 --> 00:22:17,741
I feel so sad about

304
00:22:17,825 --> 00:22:19,326
missing this great opportunity.

305
00:22:20,577 --> 00:22:22,871
I have to go meet Head Court Lady Noh.

306
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,748
I'll be off, then.

307
00:22:37,136 --> 00:22:39,054
-Did you just lock me up in here?
-I'm housing you.

308
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:40,681
So be understanding.

309
00:22:41,598 --> 00:22:43,600
I brought you here
without saying anything.

310
00:22:44,268 --> 00:22:47,271
Everyone's in a panic
because this has never happened before.

311
00:22:47,354 --> 00:22:48,772
Why are you so calm, then?

312
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:52,651
I imagined bringing you here
lots of times before.

313
00:22:53,026 --> 00:22:54,153
Although it wasn't like this.

314
00:22:57,489 --> 00:22:59,908
Did you make a contract or something?
Did you buy land?

315
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:06,165
I stopped myself from wiping it
on the wall because of your citizens.

316
00:23:06,748 --> 00:23:08,750
You should promote that employee
who was watching me.

317
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:09,877
She's a real patriot.

318
00:23:11,003 --> 00:23:13,213
Let me borrow your phone,
and give it to me unlocked.

319
00:23:13,672 --> 00:23:15,549
She wouldn't lend me her phone.

320
00:23:16,675 --> 00:23:17,843
What are you going to look up?

321
00:23:18,468 --> 00:23:20,053
I'm sure you have nowhere to call.

322
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,764
None of your business.

323
00:23:23,015 --> 00:23:23,932
What's your passcode?

324
00:23:24,016 --> 00:23:26,018
Who would even try to look
through a King's phone?

325
00:23:26,226 --> 00:23:27,060
It's not locked.

326
00:23:33,734 --> 00:23:34,693
Pass me the snack.

327
00:23:34,776 --> 00:23:36,195
It's not a snack, it's dinner.

328
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,489
I thought you would be hungry.

329
00:23:42,242 --> 00:23:43,118
You try it first.

330
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,414
-What?
-I'm not joking.

331
00:23:47,998 --> 00:23:49,708
I'm Alice in Wonderland right now.

332
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:53,170
She eats weird pills
and grows bigger and smaller and stuff.

333
00:23:53,253 --> 00:23:56,173
What if I eat this and die from poisoning
or natural causes and stuff?

334
00:23:57,507 --> 00:23:58,592
Don't worry.

335
00:23:59,134 --> 00:24:01,345
I keep my promises.
You'll die from a beheading.

336
00:24:03,013 --> 00:24:04,264
All right, then.

337
00:24:04,681 --> 00:24:05,682
I'll enjoy the food.

338
00:24:15,317 --> 00:24:16,360
You made this yourself?

339
00:24:17,527 --> 00:24:19,112
Yes. Is it good?

340
00:24:20,072 --> 00:24:20,906
No, it's bad.

341
00:24:24,368 --> 00:24:27,704
I haven't done this for about 25 years,

342
00:24:28,288 --> 00:24:29,748
but I should call my officials today.

343
00:24:30,374 --> 00:24:33,001
In this world,
if I say "Anyone out there?",

344
00:24:33,085 --> 00:24:35,420
everyone will come rushing...

345
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:38,757
Oh, gosh.

346
00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:45,514
Were you really standing outside the door?

347
00:24:45,597 --> 00:24:48,225
Do you think I have
that much time on my hands?

348
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:51,311
And you were here this whole time?

349
00:24:51,395 --> 00:24:53,063
No, I came just a minute ago.

350
00:24:54,273 --> 00:24:55,482
I barely sat down.

351
00:24:57,818 --> 00:25:00,570
I prepared a bedroom and a meal
for your guest,

352
00:25:01,947 --> 00:25:05,325
but since she seems to have eaten,
I will escort her to her room.

353
00:25:06,576 --> 00:25:09,496
It is the farthest room from your room,
Your Majesty.

354
00:25:20,424 --> 00:25:22,301
I'll see you tomorrow. Get some sleep.

355
00:25:28,098 --> 00:25:30,225
I was talking to you.

356
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,853
You should really sleep well.

357
00:25:36,106 --> 00:25:39,651
Is it far to the right
or to the left from my room?

358
00:25:40,777 --> 00:25:42,237
My goodness!

359
00:25:53,373 --> 00:25:55,334
Besides emergency situations,

360
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,420
outsiders hardly ever stay

361
00:25:58,503 --> 00:26:00,589
in the palace overnight.

362
00:26:01,506 --> 00:26:06,511
So you must never speak
about what happened today

363
00:26:06,595 --> 00:26:08,221
anywhere or to anyone.

364
00:26:09,348 --> 00:26:13,894
You must keep everything a secret,
such as the structure of the palace

365
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:17,314
or the private conversations
you've had with the King.

366
00:26:18,315 --> 00:26:19,691
You don't need to worry about that.

367
00:26:20,192 --> 00:26:22,069
I'm a government official, too.

368
00:26:22,652 --> 00:26:23,570
So I've seen.

369
00:26:26,031 --> 00:26:27,366
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

370
00:26:31,411 --> 00:26:34,289
I've been meaning to ask this.

371
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,500
How do you people

372
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:38,835
know me?

373
00:26:40,921 --> 00:26:42,798
A lieutenant in the police force?

374
00:26:44,216 --> 00:26:46,802
It is very strange.

375
00:26:48,053 --> 00:26:53,100
His Majesty has had a strange ID card
since he was young.

376
00:26:54,851 --> 00:26:59,439
There was no police officer named
Jeong Tae-eul in the Kingdom of Corea,

377
00:27:01,858 --> 00:27:04,778
and there is no such rank
as a lieutenant in the police force here.

378
00:27:05,821 --> 00:27:11,368
I thought that it was a fake ID
made as a joke or for some other reason,

379
00:27:13,203 --> 00:27:14,496
but that nonexistent person

380
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:16,373
suddenly appeared here.

381
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:19,751
It's shocking.

382
00:27:22,212 --> 00:27:24,339
Everything is just absurd,

383
00:27:25,257 --> 00:27:26,758
but there is one thing I'm sure about.

384
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:31,930
An existence that cannot be explained
will only bring chaos to the world,

385
00:27:32,347 --> 00:27:34,224
and it will only harm our King.

386
00:27:35,517 --> 00:27:36,435
So

387
00:27:37,144 --> 00:27:38,812
during your stay here,

388
00:27:39,438 --> 00:27:43,233
please try to avoid contact

389
00:27:43,567 --> 00:27:48,029
with anyone besides the King,
the Chief of the Royal Guard, and me.

390
00:27:50,031 --> 00:27:53,368
Furthermore,
don't get curious about this world,

391
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:55,787
and don't try to stay.

392
00:27:58,999 --> 00:28:00,542
And when I say "this world,"

393
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,378
that includes the King.

394
00:29:10,529 --> 00:29:12,155
I was right.

395
00:29:13,156 --> 00:29:14,282
It was far to the right.

396
00:29:20,455 --> 00:29:21,623
I thought you'd be glad to see me.

397
00:29:22,207 --> 00:29:23,416
You came empty-handed?

398
00:29:32,842 --> 00:29:35,929
There's a bed and a sofa in here.
Why are you sitting on the floor?

399
00:29:36,888 --> 00:29:39,391
There's a draft in here,
especially on the left side of the bed.

400
00:29:53,405 --> 00:29:54,406
Why are you here?

401
00:29:56,575 --> 00:29:58,535
I didn't want to leave you scared
all by yourself.

402
00:29:59,911 --> 00:30:01,997
Trust me. I'm not a weird person here.

403
00:30:03,915 --> 00:30:07,627
Why did you use the window
instead of the door if you're not weird?

404
00:30:09,796 --> 00:30:10,797
You should know...

405
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:12,549
That's the shortcut.

406
00:30:13,466 --> 00:30:14,676
The palace is really big.

407
00:30:16,303 --> 00:30:17,887
I thought you couldn't sit on the floor.

408
00:30:19,514 --> 00:30:20,765
It's not so bad, actually.

409
00:30:22,058 --> 00:30:24,561
And it feels kind of nice with the draft.

410
00:30:31,735 --> 00:30:35,655
When are you going to show me my ID card?

411
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:41,036
-Tomorrow.
-Why tomorrow?

412
00:30:41,911 --> 00:30:43,330
Were you just pretending to have it?

413
00:30:43,913 --> 00:30:44,831
I do have it.

414
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:47,917
You might try to go back to your world

415
00:30:49,461 --> 00:30:50,754
if I show you.

416
00:30:58,178 --> 00:30:59,179
What is it?

417
00:31:00,597 --> 00:31:01,598
What?

418
00:31:11,024 --> 00:31:12,108
<i>The doll on my car key.</i>

419
00:31:13,151 --> 00:31:14,402
It seems pretty cheap.

420
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,331
SHOOTING, ARCHERY

421
00:31:26,414 --> 00:31:28,375
You can win this
if you hit the target seven times.

422
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:30,835
But if you've served in the military,

423
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:32,837
it'll be a piece of cake.

424
00:31:34,047 --> 00:31:35,799
It's 10,000 won for 10 bullets.
How many do you want?

425
00:31:35,882 --> 00:31:37,175
I only need seven bullets.

426
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,405
<i>You should really know,</i>

427
00:31:59,072 --> 00:32:01,700
nothing I have is cheap.

428
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:07,455
How much did you spend?

429
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:10,375
Anyone who's served in the military
can do it with their eyes closed.

430
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:11,376
I knew it.

431
00:32:12,711 --> 00:32:14,629
Everyone in your country is a swindler.

432
00:32:16,172 --> 00:32:18,758
Be quiet. There's someone
guarding the door outside.

433
00:32:18,842 --> 00:32:22,220
Are you stupid?
There are dozens of security cameras here.

434
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:28,935
Is that a security camera?

435
00:32:29,644 --> 00:32:30,812
Wave to them.

436
00:32:31,688 --> 00:32:33,314
Twelve people are watching us right now.

437
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:35,775
For real?

438
00:32:40,238 --> 00:32:41,531
You believe everything I say now.

439
00:32:42,699 --> 00:32:43,658
That was a lie.

440
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,079
Are you kidding me?

441
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,416
So

442
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:53,960
is that really a security camera or not?

443
00:32:54,377 --> 00:32:56,546
It isn't. I was just joking.

444
00:33:00,008 --> 00:33:01,092
You want proof?

445
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:10,894
Move.

446
00:33:13,313 --> 00:33:14,355
This might look romantic,

447
00:33:15,356 --> 00:33:16,983
but it's actually really uncomfortable.

448
00:33:17,734 --> 00:33:20,195
No, it's not uncomfortable at all.

449
00:33:26,284 --> 00:33:29,746
I'm going to ask you something,
so just answer with yes or no.

450
00:33:31,372 --> 00:33:32,207
Okay.

451
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:34,834
You've never dated before, right?

452
00:33:36,795 --> 00:33:38,046
You startled me.

453
00:33:39,923 --> 00:33:40,840
Yes,

454
00:33:41,382 --> 00:33:42,258
I have.

455
00:33:42,926 --> 00:33:44,385
Should I guess when?

456
00:33:44,969 --> 00:33:46,304
Guess.

457
00:33:46,387 --> 00:33:47,222
Now.

458
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:55,355
Should I have done this?

459
00:34:19,295 --> 00:34:21,339
Try guessing what I just proved.

460
00:34:22,715 --> 00:34:23,800
The fact that I've dated before?

461
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,260
Or

462
00:34:26,678 --> 00:34:28,179
that I'm dating right now?

463
00:34:52,271 --> 00:34:55,816
Did Squad Two find the weapon used
in their murder case?

464
00:34:56,191 --> 00:34:58,527
Chief Choe is begging me to help him out.

465
00:34:59,069 --> 00:35:02,323
I just handed the information over.
It's a common kitchen knife.

466
00:35:03,157 --> 00:35:04,074
Right.

467
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,285
It'd be about this size.

468
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,244
I see.

469
00:35:10,372 --> 00:35:13,917
Here, here, and here.

470
00:35:16,086 --> 00:35:17,463
And made sure the victim would die.

471
00:35:20,174 --> 00:35:21,842
Why is the world so dark?

472
00:35:21,925 --> 00:35:23,761
Let's live a bright life.

473
00:35:23,927 --> 00:35:25,387
As bright as a light bulb.

474
00:35:25,763 --> 00:35:30,893
I can't possibly be bright when
my husband is leaving home at this hour.

475
00:35:32,728 --> 00:35:34,104
Come on, I don't want to leave.

476
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,191
But I can't help it.
Sin-jae asked for just one glass...

477
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,110
Don't make me work
after work hours have passed.

478
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:43,989
I can check your call records
within ten minutes.

479
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,577
Honey, wait. I'll push that.

480
00:35:48,661 --> 00:35:49,495
No, I'll do it.

481
00:35:49,578 --> 00:35:51,330
Honey, then could I put that in the car

482
00:35:51,413 --> 00:35:53,207
and just take a taxi
in front of the building?

483
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,750
VIOLENT CRIMES DIVISION SQUAD 3

484
00:36:11,684 --> 00:36:13,602
CHIEF PARK

485
00:36:14,937 --> 00:36:17,856
<i>I'm having a drink with you today.</i>

486
00:36:20,901 --> 00:36:22,277
<i>Who are you actually meeting, then?</i>

487
00:36:26,323 --> 00:36:27,408
<i>Loneliness.</i>

488
00:36:35,457 --> 00:36:37,751
I'M BORED, LET'S PLAY POOL

489
00:36:50,723 --> 00:36:53,100
I told you to sleep well,
but I guess you didn't.

490
00:36:55,185 --> 00:36:56,270
It's a Royal Guard uniform.

491
00:36:58,689 --> 00:37:00,107
You want me to run away in disguise?

492
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:02,609
I won't let you do that.

493
00:37:04,153 --> 00:37:05,612
I have a full schedule today.

494
00:37:06,864 --> 00:37:07,948
Get dressed and come out.

495
00:37:08,157 --> 00:37:09,575
We have to leave
without Head Court Lady Noh noticing.

496
00:37:11,785 --> 00:37:14,997
If that was your plan,
you should've been more meticulous.

497
00:37:25,382 --> 00:37:27,718
My goodness, gracious.

498
00:37:28,385 --> 00:37:31,013
I made sure to separate you,
but you came here this early.

499
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,516
Right, I guess it's better for you
to go outside.

500
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,561
Come back as late as you can.

501
00:37:38,562 --> 00:37:40,856
And don't get any photos taken.
No photos together!

502
00:37:43,317 --> 00:37:44,151
My goodness.

503
00:37:50,491 --> 00:37:51,909
This was my plan all along.

504
00:37:52,618 --> 00:37:54,119
I've succeeded.

505
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:58,665
You said you weren't a weird person here.

506
00:38:12,262 --> 00:38:14,264
IT'S MY VERY FIRST TIME
SEEING HIS MAJESTY IN PERSON!

507
00:38:30,155 --> 00:38:31,949
<i>His Majesty will</i>

508
00:38:32,032 --> 00:38:35,077
<i>make the first throw
for our victory today.</i>

509
00:38:35,244 --> 00:38:37,037
<i>Please give a round of applause.</i>

510
00:38:49,633 --> 00:38:51,176
<i>Please give a round of applause</i>

511
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:55,097
<i>and a loud cheer for the King
who did the first throw for us.</i>

512
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,105
<i>The architect Richard Fuller said,</i>

513
00:39:03,188 --> 00:39:05,858
"When I find a solution to a problem,

514
00:39:07,317 --> 00:39:10,863
I know that I am wrong if the solution
is not beautiful."

515
00:39:12,447 --> 00:39:14,032
So I'm giving you this advice

516
00:39:15,075 --> 00:39:19,121
as an amateur mathematician
and also as your King.

517
00:39:21,665 --> 00:39:22,499
WALK

518
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:24,501
Leave your lab
for at least 30 minutes a day.

519
00:39:26,753 --> 00:39:27,921
Your labs

520
00:39:28,964 --> 00:39:30,173
need to be cleaned.

521
00:39:36,471 --> 00:39:38,390
Get plenty of rest.

522
00:39:38,932 --> 00:39:41,977
Your bodies are not infinite decimals.

523
00:39:43,228 --> 00:39:44,771
ATMOSPHERE

524
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:49,526
Share beautiful moments
with your lovers or family.

525
00:39:51,445 --> 00:39:53,030
Even mathematicians can do it.

526
00:40:03,248 --> 00:40:07,210
You are all proud mathematicians
of the Kingdom of Corea.

527
00:40:08,211 --> 00:40:09,630
Whatever problem you are working on,

528
00:40:10,631 --> 00:40:13,175
I hope your solution and your answer

529
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,053
are both beautiful.

530
00:40:34,655 --> 00:40:35,489
Wasn't I cool?

531
00:40:38,241 --> 00:40:39,326
Yes, you were.

532
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:41,954
I think so, too.

533
00:40:42,037 --> 00:40:44,039
I've thought that for a long time.

534
00:40:57,177 --> 00:40:58,053
Captain Jo.

535
00:40:58,136 --> 00:40:59,721
Please do as I requested.

536
00:41:05,686 --> 00:41:07,062
Can you look this way, please?

537
00:41:15,028 --> 00:41:16,822
It doesn't seem to be a present.

538
00:41:16,947 --> 00:41:19,241
"I got you out of the palace
since you might stay locked up

539
00:41:19,324 --> 00:41:20,784
in the study.

540
00:41:21,201 --> 00:41:22,703
Have fun. I'll see you in the evening."

541
00:41:24,788 --> 00:41:26,915
That is what His Majesty said.

542
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:30,752
His Majesty has other duties to attend to,
so you're on your own now.

543
00:41:38,051 --> 00:41:38,969
"Oh, thanks.

544
00:41:39,928 --> 00:41:41,221
It's totally my style."

545
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:44,182
Tell him I said that.

546
00:41:47,019 --> 00:41:47,894
But...

547
00:41:49,354 --> 00:41:50,313
Do you have some money?

548
00:41:51,481 --> 00:41:54,901
I bought your boss
chicken and stuff in the other world.

549
00:42:07,664 --> 00:42:09,708
It takes about 50 minutes
to the disaster area.

550
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:12,502

The woman in these photos is you.

576
00:44:21,256 --> 00:44:22,090
To be exact,

577
00:44:23,175 --> 00:44:24,676
it's you in another world.

578
00:44:26,344 --> 00:44:27,804
In this world,

579
00:44:31,183 --> 00:44:33,351
you're living in hell.

581
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,500
Did you come into my house?

582
00:44:57,584 --> 00:44:59,544
You have a useless lock,

583
00:45:00,754 --> 00:45:02,964
a window with no sunlight coming through,

584
00:45:03,632 --> 00:45:05,926
and walls that can't protect you
from the cold nor the heat.

585
00:45:06,509 --> 00:45:08,053
Is that house any different

586
00:45:08,678 --> 00:45:09,763
from a grave?

587
00:45:11,223 --> 00:45:12,933
How about giving your daughter

588
00:45:13,934 --> 00:45:15,977

589
00:45:16,645 --> 00:45:19,189

590
00:45:20,941 --> 00:45:24,736
Instead of used garbage like that.

592
00:45:33,453 --> 00:45:34,579

of a cult, you've got the wrong person.

00:46:05,527 --> 00:46:07,153
What do I have to do

601
00:46:11,241 --> 00:46:12,492
to get that?

602
00:46:13,702 --> 00:46:16,037
You just have to kill the other you.

603
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,916
All right, then...

604
00:46:23,586 --> 00:46:25,630
Would you like to change

605
00:46:26,589 --> 00:46:27,924
your miserable life?

606
00:46:30,844 --> 00:46:31,928

607
00:46:32,554 --> 00:46:33,513
if I say no?

608
00:46:34,097 --> 00:46:35,557
I already saw your face.

609
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:38,685
Am I going to die

610
00:46:39,686 --> 00:46:40,562

611
00:46:41,271 --> 00:46:42,105
her?

612
00:46:42,564 --> 00:46:44,774
Well, I haven't thought about that yet.

613
00:46:46,192 --> 00:46:50,280
Nobody has refused until now.

614
00:46:57,162 --> 00:46:58,163
It's okay

615
00:46:58,955 --> 00:47:01,207
for you to be the first exception.

616
00:47:03,001 --> 00:47:04,461
It'll be interesting to me.

617
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:08,465
Wait.

618
00:47:08,798 --> 00:47:11,009
Wait...

619
00:47:14,471 --> 00:47:15,388
How

620
00:47:19,267 --> 00:47:21,186
should I contact you?

621
00:47:29,652 --> 00:47:30,820
I'll be the one

622
00:47:31,613 --> 00:47:32,989
to contact you.

623
00:47:36,368 --> 00:47:37,619
It's an urgent report from
the Ministry of National Defense.

624
00:47:38,203 --> 00:47:39,954
A Chinese fishing boat
sent a distress signal

625
00:47:40,038 --> 00:47:41,915
in the intermediate zone of the East Sea.

626
00:47:41,998 --> 00:47:44,876
The Yi Sun-sin Destroyer
that was nearby received the signal.

627
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,128
Are they sure it's a fishing boat?

628
00:47:47,212 --> 00:47:48,463
Yes, they confirmed it.

629
00:47:48,546 --> 00:47:51,966
They say it must've been stranded
because of the severe fog and swells.

630
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:53,843
This happened last spring as well.

631
00:47:54,344 --> 00:47:56,930
The Japanese Navy
could interfere again, right?

632
00:47:57,097 --> 00:48:00,058
Yes, after Japan broke off
the EEZ agreement,

633
00:48:00,141 --> 00:48:02,394
both Japan and China
are sensitive about such things.

634
00:48:02,644 --> 00:48:04,104
Let's just think simply.

635
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:06,564
We'll be more aggressive
at the next negotiation with Japan,

636
00:48:06,648 --> 00:48:08,608
and rescue those people
since we got the signal.

637
00:48:09,192 --> 00:48:12,612
And tell our people to ask them
why they keep fishing in our waters.

638
00:48:14,406 --> 00:48:15,323
Yes, ma'am.

I mean, the Kingdom of Corea's

659
00:50:41,511 --> 00:50:44,264
We export rare-earth elements
internationally.

660
00:50:44,973 --> 00:50:46,140
It's even in school textbooks.

661
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:50,103
I'm sorry, but what are
rare-earth elements?

662
00:50:50,687 --> 00:50:52,355
It's always mentioned in exams.

663
00:50:52,522 --> 00:50:54,524
Cerium, lanthanum, yttrium, samarium...

664
00:50:57,318 --> 00:50:58,444
Are you a foreigner?

665
00:51:01,155 --> 00:51:02,991
Yeah, something like that.

666
00:51:04,158 --> 00:51:06,244
So, what are they?

667
00:51:06,494 --> 00:51:08,121
Well, they're minerals.

668
00:51:08,746 --> 00:51:12,292
There are 30 million tons
just in the northern area, and in the sea.

669
00:51:12,375 --> 00:51:16,045
Anyway, those minerals in the northern
area are worth 20 billion dollars a ton,

670
00:51:16,129 --> 00:51:18,381
so it'd be about six quintillion dollars.

671
00:51:18,464 --> 00:51:22,302
And that's all owned
by the Kingdom of Corea?

672
00:51:22,385 --> 00:51:23,636
Oh, no.

673
00:51:24,345 --> 00:51:26,848
The mountains where they're buried
are owned by the royal court,

674
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:29,517
so they're actually the King's.

675
00:51:36,065 --> 00:51:37,150
<i>It's a diamond?</i>

-Luna.

we were chasing last time.

00:53:09,158 --> 00:53:10,159
Are you sure?

701
00:53:10,243 --> 00:53:11,661
She took off with our boss' money

702
00:53:11,744 --> 00:53:14,122
and even got a new hairstyle with it.
How could we forget her?

703
00:53:14,497 --> 00:53:16,791
Our boss is still in jail because of her.

704
00:53:16,874 --> 00:53:19,127
-But that bitch is wandering around--
-All right. Get lost.

705
00:53:19,711 --> 00:53:20,920

RELATIVE SEARCH RESULTS TO LEE GON,
LEE GON AND KOO SEO-RYEONG MARRIAGE

711
00:54:02,879 --> 00:54:04,630
Prime Minister, make sure to eat well.

712
00:54:04,714 --> 00:54:06,215
-Love you all!
-Me too, Prime Minister!

713
00:54:06,299 --> 00:54:07,467
Stay healthy!

714
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:16,225
You're six months pregnant,
but you still look slim.

715
00:54:16,392 --> 00:54:18,436
I watch my figure even more than
before I got married.

716
00:54:18,561 --> 00:54:20,146
My husband didn't want me to gain weight.

717
00:54:20,271 --> 00:54:22,064
Right, don't end up like me.

718
00:54:22,523 --> 00:54:24,150
My husband cheated on me

719
00:54:24,442 --> 00:54:26,110
when I was seven months pregnant.

720
00:54:29,405 --> 00:54:30,448
Excuse me.

721
00:54:30,948 --> 00:54:32,325
I guess Seo-ryeong is coming.

722
00:54:32,617 --> 00:54:35,244
I've just lost my appetite.
Did she have to come?

723
00:54:35,828 --> 00:54:36,871
I'm leaving first.

724
00:54:36,954 --> 00:54:38,498
-You're leaving?
-Yeah.

725
00:54:46,964 --> 00:54:47,882
Did she just leave?

726
00:54:47,965 --> 00:54:49,634
She said she lost her appetite.

727
00:54:50,259 --> 00:54:52,804
The food isn't even served yet.
That's nonsense.

728
00:54:53,054 --> 00:54:54,180
Didn't you know?

729
00:54:54,263 --> 00:54:56,349
Congressman Park Cheol-ung,
the one involved in the sex scandal.

730
00:54:56,432 --> 00:54:57,725
He's her sister-in-law's brother-in-law.

731
00:54:57,809 --> 00:54:59,060
So what?

732
00:54:59,143 --> 00:55:00,770
I barely remember my sister-in-law's face.

733
00:55:00,853 --> 00:55:03,815
Bad things keep happening
to people who oppose you.

734
00:55:04,941 --> 00:55:08,569
Rumors say the only one
who benefits from the scandal is you.

735
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:10,822
The person who benefits the most

736
00:55:11,239 --> 00:55:12,198
is usually the culprit.

737
00:55:12,782 --> 00:55:15,701
It's just that the people who oppose me
happen to have dark secrets.

738
00:55:16,494 --> 00:55:19,747
My husband says Prince Buyeong
has your back.

739
00:55:20,206 --> 00:55:22,041
-Is that true?
-What if it is?

740
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,126
Does he want to take sides with me?

741
00:55:24,752 --> 00:55:25,795
Can he?

742
00:55:26,879 --> 00:55:28,673
Are the Royal Family your in-laws now?

743
00:55:29,257 --> 00:55:30,800
Is that why you're serving another term?

744
00:55:30,925 --> 00:55:32,218
You really think she can?

745
00:55:32,635 --> 00:55:35,847
That "I studied while selling fish"
doesn't work anymore.

746
00:55:37,265 --> 00:55:39,392
A queen with no term limit is better

747
00:55:39,517 --> 00:55:41,727
than a Prime Minister
with a five-year term.

748
00:55:41,811 --> 00:55:44,730
But I'm not sure
if His Majesty likes old women.

749
00:55:46,858 --> 00:55:49,527
Do you want to see
if it still works or not?

750
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:53,114
What will you do if the priority
for the remainder of my term

751
00:55:53,197 --> 00:55:55,950
is to do a tax investigation into
your husband's company, Sungwoon Group?

752
00:55:57,243 --> 00:55:59,954
What'll you do
if I obsess over that like a lunatic?

753
00:56:03,249 --> 00:56:04,500
Aren't you going to leave?

754
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:09,297
I don't think our conversation
will be good for your baby.

755
00:56:13,217 --> 00:56:14,218
Auntie's sorry about that.

756
00:56:40,369 --> 00:56:43,706
SEOUL JONGNO POLICE STATION

757
00:56:59,764 --> 00:57:00,723
Excuse me.

758
00:57:03,893 --> 00:57:06,395
Don't you know me?

759
00:57:07,396 --> 00:57:08,314
It's Jeong Tae-eul.

760
00:57:08,981 --> 00:57:09,899
Don't you know?

761
00:57:09,982 --> 00:57:10,983
Well...

762
00:57:11,275 --> 00:57:12,318
Do you know her?

763
00:57:16,572 --> 00:57:18,324
No, I don't. Who are you?

764
00:57:18,407 --> 00:57:20,910
Then what about Kang Sin-jae? Or Jangmi?

765
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,579
Or what about Director Kim Hee-ju
from Forensics?

766
00:57:23,663 --> 00:57:25,414
I'm not sure who they are.

767
00:57:25,498 --> 00:57:28,125
The names sound like
they are kind-hearted people...

768
00:57:28,709 --> 00:57:29,669
What is this about?

769
00:57:30,336 --> 00:57:31,462
Are you visiting the station?

770
00:57:33,714 --> 00:57:34,799
Are you a detective?

771
00:57:37,843 --> 00:57:40,471
No, it's nothing. I guess I was mistaken.

772
00:57:41,806 --> 00:57:43,391
Enjoy your meal.

773
00:57:44,475 --> 00:57:45,559
-All right.
-Oh, okay.

774
00:57:49,522 --> 00:57:52,441
You've been on the news
too often these days.

775
00:57:52,733 --> 00:57:55,653
Yeah, I was so shocked.
I look so good on screen.

776
00:57:55,736 --> 00:57:56,570
You looked so cool.

777
00:57:56,654 --> 00:57:58,364
What do you want to eat?
I want ox bone soup.

778
00:57:58,447 --> 00:57:59,740
I want ox knee soup.

779
00:58:00,741 --> 00:58:04,912
Hey, but how did she know
we were on our way to eat?

780
00:58:12,211 --> 00:58:13,170
Bye.

781
00:58:18,217 --> 00:58:20,594
-Let's eat ox knee soup.
-All right. There's a place I know.

782
00:58:20,678 --> 00:58:24,390
It's been there for 50 years, and
the bone soup tastes just like knee soup.

783
00:58:24,473 --> 00:58:25,683
Don't be ridiculous.

784
00:58:44,827 --> 00:58:46,620
If he hasn't become a detective...

785
00:58:48,122 --> 00:58:48,998
Right...

786
00:58:49,749 --> 00:58:51,417
It means his family didn't get bankrupt.

787
00:58:52,752 --> 00:58:55,212
The Kang Sin-jae of the Kingdom of Corea

788
00:58:56,047 --> 00:58:57,048
is so cool.

789
00:59:00,801 --> 00:59:01,802
Wow.

790
01:00:19,338 --> 01:00:20,214
Oh, hey.

791
01:00:21,215 --> 01:00:22,550
I'm running into you often lately.

792
01:00:23,759 --> 01:00:24,969
And you're still eating sweets.

793
01:00:25,553 --> 01:00:28,514
I don't eat sweets that often,
but I keep getting caught eating them.

794
01:00:29,849 --> 01:00:32,351
-What are you doing in this neighborhood?
-I live around here.

795
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,605
Well, I used to live around here.

796
01:00:38,315 --> 01:00:39,692
I guess you're having a gathering today.

797
01:00:41,694 --> 01:00:43,070
I'm just going to have some drinks.

798
01:00:43,487 --> 01:00:45,447
This won't be enough
if I start drinking in the daytime.

799
01:00:45,865 --> 01:00:47,241
Do you want one?

800
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:59,170
Is it okay for a psychiatrist
to be an alcoholic?

801
01:01:01,088 --> 01:01:03,257
I'm not that dependent.
I have a high alcohol tolerance.

802
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,552
But are sweets really effective?

803
01:01:09,013 --> 01:01:11,098
It's just nice
because it's sweet and melts fast.

804
01:01:11,182 --> 01:01:13,642
Isn't it better for it to melt
slowly if it's sweet?

805
01:01:13,893 --> 01:01:15,019
It's going to melt anyway.

806
01:01:18,606 --> 01:01:20,149
By the way, what's your job?

807
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,653
I thought I'd ask you at the next session,
but you didn't come.

808
01:01:26,739 --> 01:01:28,741
-I'm a detective.
-Really?

809
01:01:29,575 --> 01:01:31,327
I guessed totally wrong.

810
01:01:32,453 --> 01:01:35,039
-I thought you were a gangster.
-What kind of psychiatrist...

811
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:38,125
That's why the meds didn't work.

812
01:01:38,209 --> 01:01:40,044
You probably didn't even take them.

813
01:01:42,213 --> 01:01:44,131
When did you move away
from this neighborhood?

814
01:01:44,548 --> 01:01:47,384
I've always lived here,
so we could've run into each other...

815
01:01:51,388 --> 01:01:55,142
Yes. I told you that my family
got bankrupt when I was little.

816
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:58,395
We moved out when I was in middle school.

817
01:02:00,773 --> 01:02:02,399
The house prices here
went up a lot, right?

818
01:02:02,942 --> 01:02:05,819
I visit here sometimes,
but I feel so bitter.

819
01:02:07,863 --> 01:02:10,824
What do you think makes you
keep returning to this place?

820
01:02:12,868 --> 01:02:15,120
Do you still have
the same recurring nightmares?

821
01:02:18,624 --> 01:02:20,292
Don't start a session
so suddenly like this.

822
01:02:21,168 --> 01:02:22,878
Especially when you're drinking.

823
01:02:23,295 --> 01:02:24,922
You're treating me like some quack.

824
01:02:27,591 --> 01:02:29,093
All right, let's just drink then.

825
01:02:44,817 --> 01:02:47,778
I'M BORED, LET'S PLAY POOL

826
01:02:50,155 --> 01:02:51,198
<i>Jeong who?</i>

827
01:02:51,699 --> 01:02:52,658
SUIM ORIENTAL CLINIC

828
01:02:52,741 --> 01:02:54,326
Jeong Do-in.

829
01:02:54,827 --> 01:02:58,122
He's a Taekwondo instructor
at a Taekwondo center.

830
01:02:58,747 --> 01:03:00,207
I don't know anyone by that name.

831
01:03:03,085 --> 01:03:04,420
Then...

832
01:03:07,756 --> 01:03:11,969
How about a woman named Ahn Bong-hui?

833
01:03:13,095 --> 01:03:14,054
Do you know her?

834
01:03:14,138 --> 01:03:16,140
Her face looks really similar to mine.

835
01:03:16,348 --> 01:03:18,684
Have you ever seen her?

836
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:20,769
Ahn Bong-hui?

837
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:22,771
No, I haven't.

838
01:03:23,355 --> 01:03:25,316
We've lived here for 30 years.

839
01:03:25,941 --> 01:03:28,068
Why? Did they say they live here?

840
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,071
No, never mind. Thank you.

841
01:03:44,084 --> 01:03:45,377
It's 41,800 won.

842
01:03:45,502 --> 01:03:46,545
Oh, right. One second.

843
01:03:56,764 --> 01:03:59,141
I'm sorry, but how much
is a standing ticket?

844
01:04:00,267 --> 01:04:01,643
It's 34,800 won.

845
01:04:06,148 --> 01:04:09,109
I rode a taxi
without thinking about the ticket.

846
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:13,697
I'm sorry,
but is there a bus terminal in Gangnam?

847
01:04:14,323 --> 01:04:15,324
There's one in Songpa-gu.

848
01:04:16,075 --> 01:04:18,994
But even if you go now,
you'd miss the last bus.

849
01:04:19,495 --> 01:04:20,746
Don't you have a card?

850
01:04:26,418 --> 01:04:29,505
I'm telling you, it's not a prank call!

851
01:04:29,588 --> 01:04:31,006
I really know Lee Gon...

852
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:35,844
I mean, the King... I know the King.

853
01:04:36,345 --> 01:04:38,389
Okay? I'm an acquaintance.

854
01:04:38,722 --> 01:04:39,598
I...

855
01:04:44,311 --> 01:04:45,854
I'm really serious.

856
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:49,024
I just need to talk to him for one minute.

857
01:04:52,736 --> 01:04:56,115
I'm short of 2,600 won,

858
01:04:56,949 --> 01:04:59,576
so I can't return to Busan right now.

859
01:05:04,915 --> 01:05:05,874
Just ten seconds.

860
01:05:05,958 --> 01:05:08,502
Please, just ten seconds. I...

861
01:05:16,051 --> 01:05:16,927
Who

862
01:05:18,512 --> 01:05:20,222
did you say it was just now?

863
01:05:21,515 --> 01:05:22,474
Well, Your Majesty,

864
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:25,602
some woman called
the Royal Court's main number

865
01:05:25,686 --> 01:05:27,688
seventeen times, asking for you.

866
01:05:28,605 --> 01:05:30,482
-The security team was checking--
-No,

867
01:05:31,692 --> 01:05:33,360
I mean the name of the caller.

868
01:05:34,695 --> 01:05:36,947
Well, she said she was Princess Diana.

869
01:05:37,406 --> 01:05:39,992
They tracked her location just in case,
and she's at Seoul Station.

870
01:05:42,536 --> 01:05:43,454
Turn the helicopter.

871
01:05:44,371 --> 01:05:45,497
We're going to Seoul.

872
01:05:46,415 --> 01:05:47,499
Pardon?

873
01:05:47,583 --> 01:05:50,377
Check Captain Jo's location right now.

874
01:05:50,461 --> 01:05:51,378
Yes, Your Majesty.

875
01:06:13,692 --> 01:06:14,610
Oh, my gosh.

876
01:06:17,321 --> 01:06:18,322
What are you doing here?

877
01:06:18,405 --> 01:06:19,948
I received orders from the King.

878
01:06:20,949 --> 01:06:22,993
He said you must be kept alive
until your beheading.

879
01:06:27,122 --> 01:06:29,666
But do you even really behead people here?

880
01:06:30,292 --> 01:06:33,253
It hasn't happened since 1920, but...

881
01:06:35,214 --> 01:06:37,007
it seems like it could happen again soon.

882
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:38,342
My gosh.

883
01:06:40,636 --> 01:06:41,887
Who are you, really?

884
01:06:42,429 --> 01:06:43,597
Are you really a detective?

885
01:06:44,681 --> 01:06:46,600
Why did you go
to the police station earlier?

886
01:06:48,852 --> 01:06:50,062
Were you following me?

887
01:06:51,813 --> 01:06:52,648
Follow me.

888
01:07:43,865 --> 01:07:44,866
I heard you were looking for me.

889
01:07:46,076 --> 01:07:46,952
Yes.

890
01:07:47,035 --> 01:07:48,161
Seventeen times.

891
01:07:49,079 --> 01:07:49,997
Yes.

892
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,915
I thought you were going to stay in Busan.

893
01:07:52,457 --> 01:07:53,917
Why did you come so far?

894
01:07:55,836 --> 01:07:57,546
Did you get to find Ahn Bong-hui?

895
01:07:57,838 --> 01:07:58,839
How did you know?

896
01:08:01,967 --> 01:08:04,094
Since when were you following me?

897
01:08:04,261 --> 01:08:06,471
You should have lent me money
if you were there all along.

898
01:08:08,098 --> 01:08:09,016
Who is she?

899
01:08:09,641 --> 01:08:12,269
Who are you looking for in this world?

900
01:08:16,857 --> 01:08:17,983
My mom.

901
01:08:20,110 --> 01:08:21,653
If this is a parallel world...

902
01:08:22,404 --> 01:08:25,365
And since Na-ri and Eun-sup are both here,

903
01:08:26,992 --> 01:08:29,077
although I might not exist...

904
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:32,914
my mother could still be alive.

905
01:08:34,541 --> 01:08:36,126
I know she is someone else,

906
01:08:37,836 --> 01:08:39,671
but I didn't want her to be sick
in this world.

907
01:08:40,756 --> 01:08:43,967
I only have memories of her
from when I was five.

908
01:08:46,386 --> 01:08:48,096
So I just wanted to watch her from afar.

909
01:08:48,805 --> 01:08:50,182
That's why I came here.

910
01:08:52,392 --> 01:08:53,810
You should have told me.

911
01:08:54,728 --> 01:08:55,937
I was just curious.

912
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:58,106
But she wasn't there.

913
01:08:59,733 --> 01:09:00,609
Anyway...

914
01:09:00,859 --> 01:09:03,945
I had fun today because of you.

915
01:09:04,529 --> 01:09:05,947
Is that why you searched for KTX?

916
01:09:06,573 --> 01:09:08,033
I was wondering what KTX is.

917
01:09:09,409 --> 01:09:10,827
Search?

918
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:14,456
He didn't tell me that.

919
01:09:15,123 --> 01:09:16,792
The auto-save function told me.

920
01:09:17,834 --> 01:09:19,836
You were curious about a lot of things.

921
01:09:20,587 --> 01:09:22,631
Why were you curious about
Lee Gon's ex-girlfriend?

922
01:09:23,298 --> 01:09:24,716
Didn't you think
that I never had a girlfriend?

923
01:09:26,927 --> 01:09:29,304
Why would you read that?

924
01:09:30,013 --> 01:09:30,889
That's cheating.

925
01:09:33,058 --> 01:09:34,726
Your Majesty, Prime Minister Koo is--

926
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:37,354
Right. You looked up
Prime Minister Koo as well.

927
01:09:37,437 --> 01:09:38,980
That was because...

928
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:43,485
Because I heard she was
the youngest female Prime Minister.

929
01:09:43,568 --> 01:09:46,029
I only looked up her name
because I was amazed by that.

930
01:09:47,531 --> 01:09:48,949
Why? Do you feel guilty?

931
01:09:49,032 --> 01:09:50,534
I meet her every Friday.

932
01:09:52,119 --> 01:09:53,036
Is she IU?

933
01:10:00,627 --> 01:10:02,003
Yes, it's Prime Minister Koo.

934
01:10:02,629 --> 01:10:06,049
She probably got a report
that your helicopter landed in Seoul.

935
01:10:36,079 --> 01:10:38,623
I'm seeing you at an unexpected hour,
in an unexpected place,

936
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:41,626
with an unexpected person, Your Majesty.

937
01:10:42,461 --> 01:10:43,336
You're right.

938
01:10:43,837 --> 01:10:45,839
And you've put me in an awkward situation.

939
01:10:48,008 --> 01:10:48,842
Nice to meet you.

940
01:10:50,135 --> 01:10:52,304
I'm Koo Seo-ryeong,
Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Corea.
