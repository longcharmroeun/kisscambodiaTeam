PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

EPISODE 4

5
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:21,642
Here's your iced tea latte.

6
00:01:21,726 --> 00:01:23,353
Thank you. Latte...

7
00:01:24,687 --> 00:01:25,646
Hot.

8
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:27,940
What the...

9
00:01:28,024 --> 00:01:29,317
Why is the iced drink so hot?

10
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,860
You are a piece of work.

11
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:32,111
Are you still drunk?

12
00:01:32,195 --> 00:01:33,738
But it was really hot just now.

13
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:38,159
My gosh.

14
00:01:38,326 --> 00:01:39,202
Are you okay, sir?

15
00:01:39,285 --> 00:01:42,872
I don't understand why guys
from the southern region like this stuff.

16
00:01:42,955 --> 00:01:45,917
How are you supposed to drink
something so hot?

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,877
Next time, I'll make the coffee for you.

18
00:01:49,128 --> 00:01:51,881
I should at least know
how to make my own cup of coffee.

19
00:01:51,964 --> 00:01:53,216
It's okay. I'll do it.

20
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,426
Sir?

21
00:01:56,677 --> 00:01:58,971
Prime Minister Koo has arrived
at the helipad.

22
00:01:59,055 --> 00:02:00,264
Today's Friday?

23
00:02:01,724 --> 00:02:02,725
I can't believe this.

24
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,062
-Sir?
-What?

25
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,237
I'm listening.

26
00:02:15,488 --> 00:02:18,533
<i>We found an intruder at Point 06,
and it turns out it was His Majesty.</i>

27
00:02:28,668 --> 00:02:29,794
<i>I've</i>

28
00:02:30,837 --> 00:02:31,921
<i>finally met you,</i>

29
00:02:33,297 --> 00:02:34,340
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

30
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,385
<i>Where are you going?</i>

31
00:02:38,386 --> 00:02:39,262
Back to my world.

32
00:02:39,887 --> 00:02:42,974
I'm the King of my country.
I left the palace empty for too long.

33
00:02:44,934 --> 00:02:46,894
<i>It's not that I didn't know
how to go back.</i>

34
00:02:47,645 --> 00:02:49,188
<i>I just didn't want to go.</i>

35
00:02:49,856 --> 00:02:51,732
<i>So, this is a parallel world?</i>

36
00:02:52,358 --> 00:02:53,443
<i>Prove it.</i>

37
00:02:53,943 --> 00:02:55,611
The proof is right in front of you.

38
00:02:57,238 --> 00:02:58,698
I came

39
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:00,950
from the other world.

40
00:03:13,588 --> 00:03:14,714
LEE SANG-DO MURDER CASE

41
00:03:15,506 --> 00:03:16,966
Evidence that points
to another evidence...

42
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:18,384
FOUND LEE SANG-DO'S BODY

43
00:03:19,218 --> 00:03:20,636
WEAPON, CROWBAR

44
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,267
Evidence that points
to another evidence...

45
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,852
CASE SUMMARY

46
00:03:29,395 --> 00:03:30,980
<i>Why did you become a detective?</i>

47
00:03:32,023 --> 00:03:34,358
I was born into my profession.

48
00:03:34,817 --> 00:03:35,735
The King.

49
00:03:36,652 --> 00:03:39,614
I am curious as to how others
grow to have aspirations.

50
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,284
You know that sounds cocky, right?

51
00:03:43,868 --> 00:03:45,203
It may be,

52
00:03:46,037 --> 00:03:48,831
but I go through things that
others don't go through because of this.

53
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:52,752
When I was little,

54
00:03:54,212 --> 00:03:57,340
I watched <i>The Police</i> with my dad

55
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,343
while other girls watched
<i>Snow White</i> and <i>The Little Mermaid</i>.

56
00:04:01,093 --> 00:04:03,638
By eight-years-old, I could tell
who the criminal was on the show.

57
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:05,223
So, it was your talent.

58
00:04:06,057 --> 00:04:07,642
No. It's the reruns.

59
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,063
As I kept watching the show,
I wanted to be a cop.

60
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:15,149
It's dangerous to be a cop.

61
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:17,818
I know.

62
00:04:18,444 --> 00:04:21,489
Not everyone in the world can be brave.

63
00:04:22,073 --> 00:04:23,533
So I decided to become brave.

64
00:04:35,753 --> 00:04:38,464
That's cool, Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

65
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:42,260
So that's my story.

66
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:45,846
Tell me what kind of a King
Kim Gae-ddong is.

67
00:04:47,974 --> 00:04:49,058
A young,

68
00:04:50,393 --> 00:04:52,603
handsome, and rich King?

69
00:04:55,481 --> 00:05:00,736
A rower, a mathematician,
a well-grown orphan,

70
00:05:03,823 --> 00:05:05,658
and the owner of the Four Tiger Sword.

71
00:05:07,868 --> 00:05:10,371
The kind of King who has
never been asked such a question

72
00:05:11,706 --> 00:05:12,999
and is trying his best

73
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:15,501
not to panic.

74
00:05:18,963 --> 00:05:21,841
Evidence that points
to another evidence...

75
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,263
Evidence that points
to another evidence...

76
00:05:31,934 --> 00:05:33,728
-Prime Minister Koo.
-Yes, I know.

77
00:05:35,354 --> 00:05:36,355
Hurry up.

78
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:39,233
I know they asked you
to buy time but make it quick.

79
00:05:39,859 --> 00:05:41,652
She's unbelievable.

80
00:05:41,736 --> 00:05:44,572
Does she think the palace
is some kind of a supermarket?

81
00:05:45,072 --> 00:05:48,284
The security team tried to buy time,
but it didn't really work.

82
00:05:48,576 --> 00:05:50,536
What did she say she's here for?

83
00:05:50,953 --> 00:05:53,664
I'm here to report to His Majesty
regarding national affairs.

84
00:05:57,543 --> 00:05:59,754
We asked everyone
to send in a written report

85
00:06:00,087 --> 00:06:02,423
unless it's regarding
a national emergency.

86
00:06:02,506 --> 00:06:05,051
And everyone already agreed to that.

87
00:06:05,134 --> 00:06:07,386
You can't just barge in here like this.

88
00:06:08,971 --> 00:06:11,474
Do you want us to make it harder
for people to visit the palace?

89
00:06:11,682 --> 00:06:14,977
Or do you just need us to teach you
the rules all over again?

90
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:17,813
Why don't you take a step back?

91
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:19,940
His Majesty is gone, isn't he?

92
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:23,861
I'd call that a national emergency.

93
00:06:24,528 --> 00:06:26,280
I won't turn a blind eye to this.

94
00:06:26,364 --> 00:06:30,159
And I won't let you hide it either
regardless of your position in the palace.

95
00:06:31,285 --> 00:06:34,455
His Majesty stayed in his study
all day long.

96
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:36,666
And he went to bed early today.

97
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,253
-I guess I should've gone to his bedroom.
-You're crossing the line!

98
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,465
You're just a government official
who will be replaced in five years.

99
00:06:44,548 --> 00:06:46,509
Don't get too ahead of yourself.

100
00:06:46,592 --> 00:06:48,386
I haven't crossed the line yet.

101
00:06:49,553 --> 00:06:52,515
Tell His Majesty
that I'll be waiting in his office.

102
00:06:53,808 --> 00:06:55,559
-Please move aside.
-Stay right there!

103
00:06:56,352 --> 00:06:59,689
I won't take a single step
from where I'm standing now.

104
00:06:59,772 --> 00:07:01,816
Then that's going to cause some trouble.

105
00:07:02,024 --> 00:07:05,903
His Majesty is the only person
who has the right to stop me.

106
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,072
And I'm a lot stronger than you.

107
00:07:13,285 --> 00:07:15,079
Ma'am!

108
00:07:15,162 --> 00:07:16,205
How dare she...

109
00:07:23,087 --> 00:07:26,298
Didn't I tell everyone to send me
written reports this week?

110
00:07:27,842 --> 00:07:28,801
Yes, Your Majesty.

111
00:07:30,386 --> 00:07:34,056
I told her so,
but she just barged in anyway.

112
00:07:36,058 --> 00:07:40,354
Since you're up, why don't you
just check what she has to report?

113
00:07:41,188 --> 00:07:42,440
Okay, then.

114
00:07:43,315 --> 00:07:44,358
Will you please excuse us?

115
00:07:56,537 --> 00:07:59,373
I was busy trying to solve a puzzle
that has perplexed me for a long time.

116
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,667
I'm sorry for worrying you.

117
00:08:02,251 --> 00:08:03,461
I made you work until so late.

118
00:08:04,044 --> 00:08:05,171
That just comes with the job.

119
00:08:05,838 --> 00:08:07,173
Did you solve the puzzle?

120
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,341
I was horrible at math,
so my answers were always

121
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:13,512
either zero or minus one
whenever I didn't know the answer.

122
00:08:14,305 --> 00:08:15,264
That's interesting.

123
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:16,724
My answer

124
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:18,601
was zero as well.

125
00:08:20,394 --> 00:08:21,270
Lucky you.

126
00:08:22,146 --> 00:08:24,315
My answer turned out to be incorrect.

127
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:26,901
By the way,

128
00:08:27,443 --> 00:08:28,611
you're a bit tan.

129
00:08:29,612 --> 00:08:31,280
I thought you stayed in your study.

130
00:08:31,363 --> 00:08:32,656
Really?

131
00:08:33,532 --> 00:08:35,367
The study is in Gwangyeongjeon.

132
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,538
It gets lots of sunlight during the day,
and it's covered with stars at night.

133
00:08:40,831 --> 00:08:44,794
It looks like my grandfather
spent a fortune building that place.

134
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:51,801
I haven't been able to laugh
due to all the problematic issues.

135
00:08:52,802 --> 00:08:54,637
I'm not really here to report anything.

136
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:57,389
I just came to see if you were missing.

137
00:08:57,598 --> 00:08:59,141
And I'm glad I came.

138
00:09:03,979 --> 00:09:05,189
You're indebted

139
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,691
to me now, Your Majesty.

140
00:09:10,402 --> 00:09:11,904
Good luck with solving this one.

141
00:09:13,322 --> 00:09:14,448
I'll see you next week.

142
00:09:18,452 --> 00:09:19,537
Prime Minister Koo.

143
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,043
Let me tell you something.

144
00:09:27,044 --> 00:09:28,504
I didn't want to offend you,

145
00:09:29,797 --> 00:09:31,048
but this won't sound pleasant.

146
00:09:34,468 --> 00:09:38,222
Every moment of my life
is the history of the Kingdom of Corea.

147
00:09:38,556 --> 00:09:41,684
And I want that history to last forever

148
00:09:43,435 --> 00:09:44,937
because I am the King of this country.

149
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:47,314
But that will require

150
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,234
more than just my benevolence.

151
00:09:52,361 --> 00:09:53,279
Therefore,

152
00:09:54,488 --> 00:09:55,948
I can never be indebted to you.

153
00:09:57,366 --> 00:09:59,952
Let's wait and see how my absence
will be recorded

154
00:10:00,035 --> 00:10:01,453
in the pages of history books.

155
00:10:02,454 --> 00:10:03,747
Do you understand?

156
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,877
I'll see you next week.

157
00:10:29,148 --> 00:10:31,317
Captain Jo, please excuse us.

158
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,234
Stay here.

159
00:10:32,985 --> 00:10:35,112
Your job is to keep me
and the royal court safe.

160
00:10:35,613 --> 00:10:36,739
Come here.

161
00:10:37,781 --> 00:10:39,408
You should be coming to me.

162
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:42,786
Then stay right there.

163
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,248
You must want to see me die of stress.

164
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:48,584
My goodness.

165
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:50,753
I missed you.

166
00:10:50,836 --> 00:10:53,380
My goodness, gracious.

167
00:10:53,464 --> 00:10:55,507
You're unbelievable! You really are!

168
00:11:00,846 --> 00:11:01,805
I'm sorry.

169
00:11:02,306 --> 00:11:06,101
It'll probably happen again,
but I'll try not to worry you next time.

170
00:11:06,185 --> 00:11:10,356
My gosh, must I die to make you come back?

171
00:11:10,856 --> 00:11:13,275
How are you going to make it to my funeral

172
00:11:13,484 --> 00:11:16,028
if you travel so far away?

173
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:17,363
Let me guarantee this.

174
00:11:18,197 --> 00:11:19,323
You'll live a long life.

175
00:11:20,324 --> 00:11:22,368
I've taken into account
how hard you struck me just now.

176
00:11:22,618 --> 00:11:23,702
It's based on science.

177
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:28,749
Prime Minister Koo barged in
as if she has a mole in here.

178
00:11:28,832 --> 00:11:30,751
And the court ladies were all suspicious.

179
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:33,253
I was so worried someone might
post something on the internet.

180
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:37,716
My goodness, what in the world...

181
00:11:38,884 --> 00:11:39,718
My gosh.

182
00:11:41,303 --> 00:11:42,513
My goodness.

183
00:11:43,305 --> 00:11:45,516
What... What happened?

184
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,644
Where are all your buttons?

185
00:11:50,229 --> 00:11:51,271
Well...

186
00:11:52,022 --> 00:11:53,190
I needed to use them urgently.

187
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,359
They used a different currency.

188
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,569
You never know

189
00:11:58,153 --> 00:11:59,822
what life has in store for you.

190
00:11:59,905 --> 00:12:03,617
My gosh, those buttons were worth so much.

191
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:05,953
I can't believe you used every single one.

192
00:12:06,036 --> 00:12:08,122
Don't you have a lot of work to do?
Let's go.

193
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:09,331
Let me help you out.

194
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:13,502
Why is he so silent?
He's making me anxious.

195
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,091
Lady Noh, Yeong just glared at me.

196
00:12:19,174 --> 00:12:21,510
My gosh, I can't believe
you used all those buttons.

197
00:12:21,635 --> 00:12:23,721
Didn't you hear me? He was glaring at me.

198
00:12:23,804 --> 00:12:25,556
How could you use every single one?

199
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:27,266
-Are you listening?
-My goodness, gracious.

200
00:12:27,349 --> 00:12:29,268
My goodness.

201
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:32,855
Lift the security level for Prince Buyeong
and keep it at Level Green.

202
00:12:40,446 --> 00:12:41,572
Your Highness.

203
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:48,203
The security level for you has been
lowered to Level Green, sir.

204
00:12:48,454 --> 00:12:51,582
I guess His Majesty
finally came out of his study.

205
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:52,958
Thank you.

206
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:54,209
Salute.

207
00:12:57,171 --> 00:12:59,423
Oh, my goodness.

208
00:12:59,506 --> 00:13:01,300
What in the world is...

209
00:13:02,551 --> 00:13:03,552
What?

210
00:13:04,344 --> 00:13:05,179
Wait.

211
00:13:07,306 --> 00:13:08,390
No.

212
00:13:08,474 --> 00:13:09,349
Wait.

213
00:13:13,729 --> 00:13:16,106
What is...

214
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,191
BBQ CHICKEN GOLDEN COUPON

215
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:20,194
What in the world...

216
00:13:24,573 --> 00:13:25,657
My gosh.

217
00:13:39,463 --> 00:13:41,882
<i>AZALEAS</i>
SELECTED POEMS OF KIM SO-WOL

SEOUL JONGNO POLICE STATION

219
00:13:46,804 --> 00:13:49,515
No. No way. Just no.

220
00:13:49,598 --> 00:13:50,933
I didn't even start speaking.

221
00:13:51,225 --> 00:13:53,477
I can tell you the whole story.

222
00:13:54,061 --> 00:13:56,855
Hey, I told you to write an investigation
report. What's taking so long?

223
00:13:57,856 --> 00:13:59,566
Lieutenant Jeong worked
overtime last night.

224
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,652
She hung a towel around her neck
to impress you.

225
00:14:02,194 --> 00:14:03,695
-Let's hear her out.
-Goodness.

226
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:06,824
First, let's prepare the mind
and the body. Here.

227
00:14:08,617 --> 00:14:11,411
I don't have to hear or see anything.
I know what you're going to say.

228
00:14:12,955 --> 00:14:14,456
From three months before the incident,

229
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,709
Lee Sang-do hasn't been accessing
the gambling website.

230
00:14:17,793 --> 00:14:19,878
It's probably because he had no money.

231
00:14:20,087 --> 00:14:21,588
He could have had money though.

232
00:14:21,672 --> 00:14:23,382
Kim Bok-man changed the website address

233
00:14:23,465 --> 00:14:25,467
multiple times a month
to escape the police dragnet

234
00:14:25,551 --> 00:14:27,052
and lost a large number of members.

235
00:14:27,636 --> 00:14:28,554
And guess what he did.

236
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:31,640
He gave a lot of points to new members.

237
00:14:31,723 --> 00:14:34,601
It's why Lee Sang-do made a new account
under his wife's name.

238
00:14:35,352 --> 00:14:37,604
But for three months before the incident,

239
00:14:37,688 --> 00:14:39,356
he hasn't accessed the website at all.

240
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:40,649
Even when he had points left.

241
00:14:42,609 --> 00:14:44,153
Let's not accuse him of murder yet.

242
00:14:44,236 --> 00:14:46,488
Let's put a gambling charge
on him for now.

243
00:14:46,738 --> 00:14:49,158
-We can charge him with murder later.
-Don't you do this to me.

244
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:51,160
Well, I know a bit
about gambling addiction.

245
00:14:51,243 --> 00:14:53,287
-How many points did he have?
-About 3.7 million.

246
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,122
Lieutenant Jeong has got a point.

247
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:57,708
He wouldn't have been able to stay away
if he had 3.7 million in points.

248
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,586
If you get lucky enough to double it
three times, you get 30 million won.

249
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,088
We are restoring Lee Sang-do's 2G phone.

250
00:15:03,422 --> 00:15:06,675
It will take two weeks to restore,
so let's wait until then.

251
00:15:06,758 --> 00:15:07,593
My gosh.

252
00:15:08,594 --> 00:15:09,803
I'll give you exactly two weeks.

253
00:15:10,596 --> 00:15:12,431
If you fail to find evidence
within that time,

254
00:15:13,098 --> 00:15:15,559
-I will kick both of you out.
-Yes, sir.

255
00:15:15,642 --> 00:15:17,936
Division Two requested for backup
for a robbery case

256
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,230
I don't want to see you. Get out of here.

257
00:15:20,314 --> 00:15:21,190
Yes, sir!

258
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:22,774
I admire you.

259
00:15:24,818 --> 00:15:28,197
Do you have the things from the pocket
of the buttonless jacket?

260
00:15:28,906 --> 00:15:31,116
I want the things in the outer pockets
stored in the study

261
00:15:31,742 --> 00:15:33,327
and the book from the inner pocket...

262
00:15:35,662 --> 00:15:36,496
in the bedroom.

263
00:15:37,247 --> 00:15:39,583
Get ready. We don't have time.

264
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:40,542
Yes, ma'am.

265
00:15:46,632 --> 00:15:47,841
Last night,

266
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:50,344
the father of Captain Choe Gi-tae,

267
00:15:51,178 --> 00:15:53,430
who was your superior in the army,

268
00:15:54,181 --> 00:15:55,474
has passed away.

269
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,895
All your military colleagues
will be there.

270
00:16:00,395 --> 00:16:02,397
It's a great chance

271
00:16:03,315 --> 00:16:07,486
to dismiss the rumors
and show that you are well.

272
00:16:09,363 --> 00:16:10,239
It's fortunate

273
00:16:12,366 --> 00:16:13,700
that I came right on time.

274
00:16:13,784 --> 00:16:17,246
You could have told us before you left...

275
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:29,258
Put this on before you go in
and please hold on for a while.

276
00:17:06,086 --> 00:17:07,504
Thank you for coming, Your Majesty.

277
00:17:08,463 --> 00:17:09,798
How have you been?

278
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:11,842
I am very much sorry for your loss.

279
00:17:12,843 --> 00:17:14,720
May he rest in peace.

280
00:17:15,387 --> 00:17:16,847
I have been a bad son my whole life,

281
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,099
but I was lucky enough to be by his side
on his deathbed.

282
00:17:19,182 --> 00:17:20,726
He was laid to rest.

283
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:23,979
I have followed your lead and admired you

284
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,857
as you were an upright soldier
and my role model.

285
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:31,862
I'm sure your father was proud of you.

286
00:17:33,488 --> 00:17:35,198
Thank you for your kind words,
Your Majesty.

287
00:17:38,952 --> 00:17:40,829
I saw that you won the rowing competition.

288
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,791
I should have stopped you from
leaving the army and made you a soldier.

289
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,004
Right. You wouldn't have been promoted
because you're not talented in combats.

290
00:17:49,588 --> 00:17:51,798
-You came in last place in your battalion.
-Last place...

291
00:17:53,175 --> 00:17:54,426
I wasn't...

292
00:17:58,597 --> 00:18:01,099
Hasn’t the information been classified
as the national secret yet?

293
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,935
I heard you never leave Gangnyeongjeon,
so I was worried.

294
00:18:04,728 --> 00:18:06,730
But I guess there was no need to.

295
00:18:08,231 --> 00:18:09,733
You should come to the bridge sometime.

296
00:18:09,816 --> 00:18:12,110
You can come
as a discharged Navy Lieutenant,

297
00:18:12,194 --> 00:18:14,738
or as the commander-in-chief
of the Kingdom of Corea.

298
00:18:15,322 --> 00:18:16,239
Okay.

299
00:18:17,032 --> 00:18:18,617
I will visit you.

300
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,135
BUSAN CATHEDRAL

301
00:19:03,787 --> 00:19:06,832
Focus on driving only.
That is best for His Majesty's safety.

302
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:08,583
Yes, sir.

303
00:19:30,188 --> 00:19:31,106
I see.

304
00:19:31,189 --> 00:19:33,316
All we can see
is the wheel of the motorbike.

305
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:36,361
I knew she would get in trouble.

306
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:39,781
She always gets out of a taxi
in front of the store

307
00:19:39,865 --> 00:19:42,451
and buys beer and cigarettes
in our convenience store.

308
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:45,203
And she's always drunk.

309
00:19:45,328 --> 00:19:47,581
She is lucky that I'm a nice person.

310
00:19:47,664 --> 00:19:49,875
If I weren't,
I would have robbed her first.

311
00:19:56,715 --> 00:19:58,300
How long have you been working here?

312
00:19:59,342 --> 00:20:00,969
Are you suspecting me?

313
00:20:01,678 --> 00:20:04,139
I have been working here
for less than a month now.

314
00:20:04,222 --> 00:20:06,099
Do you know the phone number
of the person who worked before you?

315
00:20:06,183 --> 00:20:09,686
The culprit knew where the victim
was going to be, how much she would have,

316
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:11,480
and even the blind spots of the CCTV.

317
00:20:11,563 --> 00:20:13,231
Right. I see.

318
00:20:13,356 --> 00:20:16,401
Hang on a second.
I have her number because of the handover.

319
00:20:18,904 --> 00:20:20,572
There it is. Here.

320
00:20:27,954 --> 00:20:30,081
Her number is found
on the online secondhand market.

321
00:20:30,165 --> 00:20:32,042
She's selling a red wallet.

322
00:20:38,006 --> 00:20:40,008
Tae-eul, do you need a wallet?

323
00:20:40,884 --> 00:20:42,135
How about we buy it in person?

324
00:20:44,471 --> 00:20:45,347
Excuse me.

325
00:20:46,264 --> 00:20:47,265
Are you buying the wallet?

326
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:49,100
Oh, right.

327
00:20:50,185 --> 00:20:53,396
Can I see the wallet first?

328
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:59,152
Oh, my. It's pretty.

329
00:20:59,361 --> 00:21:00,654
It's almost brand new.

330
00:21:00,737 --> 00:21:02,197
I only unpacked it and didn't use it.

331
00:21:02,781 --> 00:21:03,949
I see.

332
00:21:04,032 --> 00:21:07,744
I would have asked for a refund,
but I lost the receipt.

333
00:21:08,578 --> 00:21:10,163
Will you wire me the money?

334
00:21:12,832 --> 00:21:14,668
I think I will arrest you.

335
00:21:15,252 --> 00:21:16,294
Ms. Kim Su-jin?

336
00:21:17,087 --> 00:21:20,674
Where were you between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m.
yesterday?

337
00:21:20,757 --> 00:21:21,675
Who are you?

338
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:23,260
What the hell?

339
00:21:23,343 --> 00:21:24,469
-Wait.
-It hurts.

340
00:21:24,553 --> 00:21:25,971
Wait a second.

341
00:21:27,013 --> 00:21:30,267
Ms. Kim Su-jin, you are under arrest
for bodily injury and theft.

342
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,185
You have the right to an attorney,

343
00:21:32,978 --> 00:21:34,563
and you have the right to remain silent.

344
00:21:34,646 --> 00:21:36,314
You have all sorts of rights.

345
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:38,275
Let's go.

346
00:21:47,325 --> 00:21:48,535
Fine. I'm coming.

347
00:21:52,914 --> 00:21:54,082
Detective Jeong, thank you.

348
00:21:54,165 --> 00:21:55,500
No problem. See you.

349
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,459
Bye.

350
00:22:06,886 --> 00:22:08,972
Oh, hey.

351
00:22:09,806 --> 00:22:10,640
Hi.

352
00:22:10,724 --> 00:22:12,017
What are you doing here?

353
00:22:13,184 --> 00:22:14,477
I'm working.

354
00:22:15,061 --> 00:22:17,147
I haven't heard from you in a while,
so I was curious.

355
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,648
How have you been?

356
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,108
I'm busy every day.

357
00:22:20,191 --> 00:22:22,736
What about your nightmares?
Is it better now?

358
00:22:25,238 --> 00:22:26,197
What?

359
00:22:30,327 --> 00:22:32,454
I've been having
sweet dreams too recently.

360
00:22:32,537 --> 00:22:34,623
There's no way
that you can be cured this quick.

361
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:38,084
You must still eat a lot of sweets.

362
00:22:39,753 --> 00:22:40,879
It's better than medicine.

363
00:22:40,962 --> 00:22:42,297
There is no way it is.

364
00:22:43,256 --> 00:22:44,799
If sweets don't work, come see me again.

365
00:22:52,724 --> 00:22:53,642
Who is she?

366
00:22:53,725 --> 00:22:56,144
I have never seen any woman
who talks to you

367
00:22:56,227 --> 00:22:58,730
except for testifiers, suspects,

368
00:22:59,397 --> 00:23:00,315
and criminals.

369
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,611
Is that mystery man's horse
still at your place?

370
00:23:07,656 --> 00:23:10,533
Don't change the subject. Who is she?

371
00:23:10,825 --> 00:23:12,285
You're the one changing the subject.

372
00:23:12,994 --> 00:23:16,164
He said he was a King or something.
Was anything stolen from your house?

373
00:23:17,749 --> 00:23:19,209
He left, saying he was going home.

374
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:21,086
Where's his home?

375
00:23:21,836 --> 00:23:23,922
I don't know where his home is.

376
00:23:37,644 --> 00:23:40,814
Yeong. Are you going to keep
giving me the silent treatment?

377
00:23:44,609 --> 00:23:45,443
What?

378
00:23:46,111 --> 00:23:47,404
Do you want me to hold your hand?

379
00:23:49,823 --> 00:23:50,907
Please, give me your phone.

380
00:23:51,282 --> 00:23:52,867
I'm going to install a GPS tracking app.

381
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,078
Because you kept

382
00:23:56,371 --> 00:23:58,873
staying in the study, I almost got fired.

383
00:23:58,957 --> 00:23:59,916
You're lying.

384
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:02,210
You know what?

385
00:24:02,877 --> 00:24:04,045
When it was first invented,

386
00:24:04,629 --> 00:24:06,464
the GPS had large discrepancies

387
00:24:06,548 --> 00:24:09,426
between the user's location on-screen
and the actual location, but...

388
00:24:09,551 --> 00:24:10,719
What's your ID?

389
00:24:11,678 --> 00:24:13,054
"King," of course.

390
00:24:13,972 --> 00:24:16,057
But when they applied
Einstein's theory of relativity

391
00:24:16,141 --> 00:24:18,268
to the tracking process--

392
00:24:18,351 --> 00:24:19,769
That ID already exists.

393
00:24:20,687 --> 00:24:22,939
Who dare calls himself a King
when I am the King?

394
00:24:24,315 --> 00:24:25,442
Go for "King Two."

395
00:24:26,234 --> 00:24:28,236
Anyway, about the theory of relativity--

396
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,113
All Kings are taken until King 987.

397
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,825
Track the IP addresses
of those 988 people.

398
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,369
Right now.

399
00:24:36,453 --> 00:24:37,996
It's the King's order.

400
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,583
Currently, our shipbuilding companies
has bid for 120 vessels, 40 each,

401
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:45,003
in order to win the transportation rights
for the LNG from Qatar Gas,

402
00:24:45,086 --> 00:24:48,339
which is one of Qatar's
government-controlled companies.

403
00:24:49,174 --> 00:24:53,011
Therefore, it's inevitable for us
to compete with the Japanese.

404
00:24:53,094 --> 00:24:56,765
We're already facing trouble
with our Japanese competitors

405
00:24:56,848 --> 00:24:59,350
regarding the patent of our PRS system--

406
00:24:59,434 --> 00:25:02,228
Did you prepare a presentation
to tell me that we can't do it?

407
00:25:02,771 --> 00:25:06,441
I bet you asked your smart subordinates
to make the PowerPoint for you.

408
00:25:09,486 --> 00:25:12,113
The Kingdom of Corea produces
rare-earth elements,

409
00:25:12,197 --> 00:25:14,115
and we have advanced technology
to process them.

410
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:16,159
And thanks to that, we have allies.

411
00:25:17,035 --> 00:25:21,289
Figure out which country can help us
persuade Qatar as fast as possible.

412
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:25,376
Next, the Ministry of Agriculture
and Forestry.

413
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,755
Why haven't I still heard about
the pesticides found in eggs?

414
00:25:28,838 --> 00:25:30,173
This is crazy.

415
00:25:30,423 --> 00:25:32,258
-Is the Prime Minister inside?
-Yes, but she's--

416
00:25:32,342 --> 00:25:33,510
Yes, I know. It's urgent.

417
00:25:35,094 --> 00:25:36,054
Ma'am.

418
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:37,806
Ma'am.

419
00:25:38,473 --> 00:25:40,058
I'm too tired to eat.

420
00:25:40,725 --> 00:25:42,977
I don't want to eat.
I'll have some red ginseng instead.

421
00:25:44,062 --> 00:25:46,981
You need to see this. It's urgent.

422
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:52,946
<i>That woman keeps saying
we need to spend more on national defense</i>

423
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:55,198
<i>when she doesn't even know anything.</i>

424
00:25:55,281 --> 00:25:56,866
<i>That will only upset the Japanese.</i>

425
00:25:57,992 --> 00:26:01,412
Congressman Park was
at Jeguk University's homecoming event.

426
00:26:01,496 --> 00:26:04,415
A few reporters from that university
were apparently there, too.

427
00:26:06,668 --> 00:26:08,253
<i>I'm sick of hearing her say that.</i>

428
00:26:08,753 --> 00:26:12,674
<i>Japan is our ally.
Are you trying to start a war with them?</i>

429
00:26:13,341 --> 00:26:17,679
<i>I bet she only cares about
what she's going to wear every day.</i>

430
00:26:17,971 --> 00:26:20,849
<i>What would she know about politics?</i>

431
00:26:20,932 --> 00:26:22,600
<i>Look at her nose.</i>

432
00:26:22,934 --> 00:26:25,979
<i>It can't be her actual nose.</i>

433
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:29,148
<i>My friend is the best cosmetic surgeon
in the country.</i>

434
00:26:29,232 --> 00:26:30,400
<i>And I already asked him.</i>

435
00:26:30,483 --> 00:26:32,235
Should I kill this jerk?

436
00:26:32,986 --> 00:26:34,195
What?

437
00:26:34,487 --> 00:26:36,447
Look at me. Does my nose look fake?

438
00:26:36,531 --> 00:26:38,658
It's probably because it looks so perfect.

439
00:26:39,284 --> 00:26:40,118
Right?

440
00:26:41,744 --> 00:26:44,289
Then let's just make him
regret that he's alive.

441
00:26:52,255 --> 00:26:54,465
Send this to Reporter Song.
Tell him it's exclusive.

442
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:01,848
My goodness.

443
00:27:02,348 --> 00:27:05,894
Why did you keep...
I mean, where did you get this?

444
00:27:07,103 --> 00:27:09,397
Mr. Kim, you've been working for me
for a year and a half.

445
00:27:09,939 --> 00:27:12,400
I'm surprised you seem intrigued
by these kinds of photos.

446
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,069
What's the matter with you?

447
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,698
Do you really want to be a politician?
I'm really curious.

448
00:27:19,282 --> 00:27:20,325
I'll send it right away.

449
00:27:29,834 --> 00:27:31,836
Where do you get those kinds of photos?

450
00:27:33,796 --> 00:27:35,048
I'm just really curious.

451
00:27:36,257 --> 00:27:37,926
Why don't you have coffee outside?

452
00:27:38,551 --> 00:27:40,386
You should drink near the campus.

453
00:27:41,012 --> 00:27:42,972
And with someone handsome if possible.

454
00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:03,618
Prime Minister Koo.

455
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,790
It's been a while, Prince Buyeong.

456
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:10,583
I'm glad.

457
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:12,251
What do you mean?

458
00:28:12,543 --> 00:28:14,504
His Majesty has been away.

459
00:28:14,587 --> 00:28:16,839
And seeing you make
journal entries so smoothly like this,

460
00:28:16,923 --> 00:28:19,759
only means that you know that he's away.

461
00:28:20,343 --> 00:28:21,678
I have no idea what you're saying.

462
00:28:22,428 --> 00:28:24,639
His Majesty was in his study.

463
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:30,103
Once he begins studying mathematics,
he doesn't come out for days and weeks.

464
00:28:30,186 --> 00:28:31,854
It happens a few times every year.

465
00:28:31,938 --> 00:28:34,607
Could it be that he was out
every time that happened?

466
00:28:34,691 --> 00:28:38,277
Whenever it happened,
the security level for you was elevated.

467
00:28:42,281 --> 00:28:43,574
I'm just curious.

468
00:28:44,117 --> 00:28:45,660
You were born as the son of the King,

469
00:28:45,743 --> 00:28:49,163
but four generations of your family are
not allowed to be involved in politics

470
00:28:49,247 --> 00:28:52,000
nor hold important posts.
You can only be a scholar.

471
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:54,293
And all your children and grandchildren
must live abroad.

472
00:28:54,961 --> 00:28:57,005
Are you okay with such a life?

473
00:28:58,089 --> 00:29:00,049
People are jealous of the royal family.

474
00:29:00,758 --> 00:29:02,301
Don't you think it's unfair?

475
00:29:02,385 --> 00:29:05,263
Not once have I thought that way.

476
00:29:07,265 --> 00:29:08,224
Is that so?

477
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,978
Prime Minister Koo,
you were born to an ordinary family.

478
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:16,315
People love you
for your friendly and honest image.

479
00:29:17,775 --> 00:29:21,404
I suppose class disparity
can never disappear

480
00:29:21,487 --> 00:29:23,906
nor will it ever disappear in the future.

481
00:29:28,077 --> 00:29:29,954
That's quite a dangerous statement.

482
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:33,875
I guess our conversation isn't so light.

483
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,045
So, what's your point?

484
00:29:38,046 --> 00:29:42,300
Don't you think our current situation
is perfect to spark rumors?

485
00:29:42,884 --> 00:29:44,719
Yes. Exactly.

486
00:29:55,396 --> 00:29:58,357
A member of the ruling party was
just kicked out because of a scandal.

487
00:30:01,903 --> 00:30:05,364
ASSEMBLYMAN PARK'S SEX SCANDAL

488
00:30:06,324 --> 00:30:08,826
Do you think people will think
that you have my back

489
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:11,496
if I sit here with you like this?

490
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,247
I hope they do.

491
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:21,798
Your Majesty.

492
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,259
I'm here for a scolding.

493
00:30:28,054 --> 00:30:32,225
Head Court Lady Noh made tons
of traditional donuts today.

494
00:30:33,142 --> 00:30:35,228
I hope it tastes similar
to what you had up North.

495
00:30:35,311 --> 00:30:37,897
It'll taste pretty similar
since it was made by Head Court Lady Noh.

496
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,315
Thank you for this.

497
00:30:41,025 --> 00:30:43,194
Did you have fun, Your Majesty?

498
00:30:44,153 --> 00:30:45,947
Where did you go this time?

499
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,198
This time,

500
00:30:48,866 --> 00:30:50,701
I went somewhere very far away.

501
00:30:53,538 --> 00:30:55,706
It was the most exciting trip ever.

502
00:30:57,875 --> 00:31:00,545
If you're going to keep traveling,

503
00:31:00,962 --> 00:31:03,589
at least get married and have a son.

504
00:31:03,965 --> 00:31:06,634
You have a duty to carry on
the royal bloodline.

505
00:31:06,717 --> 00:31:08,594
Gosh, you sounded so old.

506
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:11,389
I thought I was in the Joseon Dynasty.

507
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,441
My favorite photo is the one

508
00:31:24,235 --> 00:31:26,487
taken during the spring field trip
in elementary school.

509
00:31:28,948 --> 00:31:30,408
There are cherry blossoms everywhere.

510
00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:33,327
And I'm holding both your hand

511
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:37,748
and Head Court Lady Noh's hand.

512
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,211
The hand of my uncle who has to live
his entire life away from his family.

513
00:31:43,921 --> 00:31:44,755
Your Majesty.

514
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:46,591
Don't you hate me

515
00:31:47,633 --> 00:31:48,509
for that?

516
00:31:48,593 --> 00:31:51,220
That's complete nonsense.

517
00:31:53,139 --> 00:31:56,767
My father's stepbrother killed my father

518
00:31:57,435 --> 00:31:59,270
and even tried to strangle me.

519
00:32:01,272 --> 00:32:05,193
And because of me,
all your family has to live abroad.

520
00:32:06,527 --> 00:32:07,528
All their lives.

521
00:32:08,404 --> 00:32:09,697
So I'm curious.

522
00:32:11,782 --> 00:32:13,367
Is my father's cousin

523
00:32:15,036 --> 00:32:16,120
on my side

524
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,623
or not?

525
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:22,793
What are you asking, Your Majesty?

526
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,213
You're being absurd.

527
00:32:26,214 --> 00:32:29,926
Do you want me to kill my own children
to prove my loyalty to you?

528
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,303
I couldn't bear

529
00:32:33,387 --> 00:32:35,806
to kill my own kids,

530
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,559
so I forbade them from coming here
until the day they die.

531
00:32:39,727 --> 00:32:43,898
What kind of absurd rumor
has made you come this far?

532
00:32:43,981 --> 00:32:45,441
I wasn't swayed

533
00:32:46,901 --> 00:32:48,277
by any rumors.

534
00:32:49,779 --> 00:32:51,572
That wasn't my question.

535
00:32:55,534 --> 00:32:57,578
Are you hiding something from me?

536
00:32:59,622 --> 00:33:02,875
I trust you, and I admire you.

537
00:33:04,085 --> 00:33:06,003
Please don't hide anything from me.

538
00:33:12,218 --> 00:33:14,553
Here's something I've been
trying to solve for a long time.

539
00:33:15,805 --> 00:33:16,806
I can't seem to solve it,

540
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,849
so I'll leave it here with you.

541
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:46,585
AUTOPSY REPORT
LEE JONG-IN

542
00:33:55,177 --> 00:33:56,095
What's wrong?

543
00:33:59,265 --> 00:34:00,224
Do you think

544
00:34:01,475 --> 00:34:03,352
the library is
in the same place in this world?

545
00:34:04,729 --> 00:34:05,646
The library?

546
00:35:08,084 --> 00:35:10,795
<i>THE PARALLEL UNIVERSE</i>

547
00:36:44,813 --> 00:36:45,772
When did you get back?

548
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,443
Did you have dinner yet?
If you haven't, let's go eat out.

549
00:36:51,152 --> 00:36:52,070
Where have you been?

550
00:36:52,153 --> 00:36:55,740
I was with friends. You know the mothers
of your middle school friends?

551
00:36:55,824 --> 00:36:57,784
Did you go to the house again?

552
00:36:58,493 --> 00:36:59,911
I told you not to...

553
00:37:00,996 --> 00:37:02,372
Give me your bag.

554
00:37:03,581 --> 00:37:05,917
I didn't go.
Come on. What's wrong with you?

555
00:37:06,084 --> 00:37:08,545
Sin-jae, why are you doing this?

556
00:37:22,684 --> 00:37:25,103
I got lucky today.

557
00:37:26,021 --> 00:37:27,772
I won these.

558
00:37:28,565 --> 00:37:30,942
Please, believe me. This is my last time.

559
00:37:31,026 --> 00:37:32,110
Seriously, Mom.

560
00:37:33,445 --> 00:37:35,905
This is way more than
how much you can earn!

561
00:37:45,915 --> 00:37:48,793
Jangmi, I'm going to send you an address,

562
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,378
so come to the address right now.

563
00:37:52,505 --> 00:37:53,465
Where's the house?

564
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,426
I said, where's the house?

565
00:37:59,429 --> 00:38:00,263
Mom!

566
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:01,723
All right. Let's do this!

567
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,394
All right. Let's do it!

568
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,775
Let's go.

569
00:38:30,919 --> 00:38:33,755
Jangmi, from now on, take pictures of
everything that has a face.

570
00:38:34,547 --> 00:38:35,382
Yes, sir.

571
00:38:39,636 --> 00:38:40,845
Hey!

572
00:38:41,596 --> 00:38:43,515
Stop!

573
00:38:45,683 --> 00:38:47,018
Is this a scam?

574
00:38:47,268 --> 00:38:48,561
-What's going on?
-What's this?

575
00:38:48,645 --> 00:38:51,439
First, take your money back.

576
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:53,650
Now, look over here and smile.

577
00:38:55,026 --> 00:38:56,069
Show me your eight teeth.

578
00:38:56,653 --> 00:38:57,695
All right.

579
00:38:58,154 --> 00:38:59,697
I'm dead if I get caught again.

580
00:38:59,781 --> 00:39:03,034
Hey, you. The man who looks like
the picture on the card. Scoot over.

581
00:39:03,118 --> 00:39:04,160
Look over here. Good.

582
00:39:04,953 --> 00:39:07,080
-Hey, come over here and join the photo.
-Sin-jae.

583
00:39:08,206 --> 00:39:10,166
-Smile.
-Goodness.

584
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:13,628
My intuition is never wrong
when it comes to shit hitting the fan.

585
00:39:14,629 --> 00:39:16,881
I was wondering who took my money,

586
00:39:17,632 --> 00:39:18,883
and gosh.

587
00:39:19,592 --> 00:39:20,802
It was Detective Kang's mother.

588
00:39:23,721 --> 00:39:25,223
Did you have some meat with your son?

589
00:39:25,598 --> 00:39:28,560
He said he was a builder.
He said he would do it, so I believed him.

590
00:39:29,227 --> 00:39:31,104
I haven't seen him before today.
Believe me.

591
00:39:31,187 --> 00:39:32,480
Shut your mouth and follow me.

592
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:36,568
Are you out of your mind?

593
00:39:36,651 --> 00:39:38,361
How dare you touch a cop's body.

594
00:39:38,611 --> 00:39:40,572
Do you want me to help you
remove your wrist?

595
00:39:41,156 --> 00:39:42,323
Wow.

596
00:39:42,615 --> 00:39:45,952
Looking at his build,
he looks just like one of us.

597
00:39:46,578 --> 00:39:47,829
I told you to shut your mouth.

598
00:39:49,622 --> 00:39:51,291
You're going away for a long time.

599
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:55,128
I will make sure that your last meal
will be in prison.

600
00:39:55,837 --> 00:39:56,796
Sure, sure.

601
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,923
I should do as the policeman says.

602
00:39:59,716 --> 00:40:01,384
But I'm not the only one going away, am I?

603
00:40:02,093 --> 00:40:04,053
The person who won my money
should be arrested too.

604
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:05,722
Am I wrong, ma'am?

605
00:40:13,062 --> 00:40:13,897
Mom.

606
00:40:15,023 --> 00:40:16,024
Watch this.

607
00:40:22,113 --> 00:40:24,532
Oh, my.

608
00:40:25,158 --> 00:40:27,577
Taking money from an asshole like this
makes me a joke.

609
00:40:28,203 --> 00:40:30,330
And I can't work as a detective
when this happens.

610
00:40:30,663 --> 00:40:32,499
I need to quit, okay?

611
00:40:32,582 --> 00:40:34,417
You don't know how much money this is.

612
00:40:35,793 --> 00:40:38,963
Come on, Mom!

613
00:40:41,424 --> 00:40:42,759
I'm here because of a report.

614
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,441
I made the report.

615
00:40:59,776 --> 00:41:03,363
Detective Kang, this isn't right.

616
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,198
I won't go alone.

617
00:41:06,658 --> 00:41:10,203
Arrest every single one of them here.

618
00:41:11,162 --> 00:41:12,872
-Sin-jae.
-Sir.

619
00:41:12,956 --> 00:41:13,873
Come with me.

620
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:17,210
Sin-jae!

621
00:41:17,293 --> 00:41:18,419
I will stay.

622
00:41:21,047 --> 00:41:22,173
Come on out.

623
00:41:24,259 --> 00:41:25,718
I will wrap this up with them.

624
00:41:27,428 --> 00:41:29,389
That's all I will do.

625
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,311
Sin-jae!

626
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,524
You can't just leave like this.
You should take me with you.

627
00:41:43,653 --> 00:41:46,739
He's my son. I'm his mother.

628
00:41:46,823 --> 00:41:48,241
Bye then.

629
00:41:48,324 --> 00:41:51,244
My son is a detective! Sin-jae!

630
00:41:51,327 --> 00:41:52,829
Bye, sir.

631
00:42:44,213 --> 00:42:45,089
I'm sorry.

632
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:47,550
Should I try to get it out?

633
00:42:49,385 --> 00:42:50,595
You can't.

634
00:42:51,387 --> 00:42:52,764
It all went down the drain.

635
00:42:54,015 --> 00:42:55,558
My performance assessment.

636
00:42:55,933 --> 00:42:57,060
My promotion.

637
00:43:02,899 --> 00:43:03,775
It's okay.

638
00:43:08,571 --> 00:43:10,823
FORENSICS TEAM, GYEONG-RAN

639
00:43:12,283 --> 00:43:14,494
I know it was a mistake.

640
00:43:15,411 --> 00:43:16,621
You can go now.

641
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,708
It's okay.

642
00:43:22,418 --> 00:43:23,795
I'm fine.

643
00:43:31,094 --> 00:43:32,220
Hey, Gyeong-ran.

644
00:43:32,303 --> 00:43:36,182
<i>Hey, where did that money come from?
Where did you get that bill?</i>

645
00:43:36,974 --> 00:43:38,059
<i>Where are you now?</i>

646
00:43:38,142 --> 00:43:39,352
What's the matter?

647
00:43:45,316 --> 00:43:46,359
What is it?

648
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:48,903
What is this?

649
00:43:48,986 --> 00:43:50,029
What do you think?

650
00:43:51,364 --> 00:43:52,740
It's a flyer.

651
00:43:53,574 --> 00:43:55,868
Yes, it is. It's an advertisement.

652
00:43:57,286 --> 00:43:59,038
But did you know that this is real?

653
00:43:59,247 --> 00:44:02,375
It's real. Even down to its watermark.

654
00:44:02,959 --> 00:44:04,252
Even his watermark is handsome.

655
00:44:05,002 --> 00:44:06,087
What are you talking about?

656
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:09,132
I know this sounds crazy,
but this is real.

657
00:44:09,716 --> 00:44:13,928
The proportion of noil, ink, and even
the anti-forgery methods are identical.

658
00:44:14,554 --> 00:44:17,682
It's a real banknote printed by a bank.

659
00:44:33,656 --> 00:44:35,742
THE KING RETURNS TO THE PALACE

660
00:44:42,081 --> 00:44:43,040
<i>Leaving the palace.</i>

661
00:44:48,087 --> 00:44:49,213
<i>Returning to the palace.</i>

662
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,100
<i>So it happened.</i>

663
00:45:02,602 --> 00:45:04,312
<i>My nephew</i>

664
00:45:06,439 --> 00:45:08,232
<i>finally stands before the legend.</i>

665
00:45:29,086 --> 00:45:31,214
Father.

666
00:45:31,798 --> 00:45:34,759
Father.

667
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:10,253
<i>The sky bestows the heart upon us,
and the ground helps the spirit.</i>

668
00:46:11,003 --> 00:46:12,505
<i>The sun and the moon are formed.</i>

669
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,176
<i>As the mountains and streams form,
lightning strikes.</i>

670
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:22,223
A sage is moved to defeat
the evil of the mountains and streams.

671
00:46:23,307 --> 00:46:27,103
Wield it with deep thoughts
and make things right.

672
00:46:28,271 --> 00:46:30,273
That is the calling of
the Four Tiger Sword.

673
00:46:32,733 --> 00:46:35,611
Only the King can become
the owner of the Four Tiger Sword.

674
00:46:38,197 --> 00:46:41,325
Do you think you can
fulfill this calling, Gon?

675
00:46:41,409 --> 00:46:43,953
Yes, Father.

676
00:46:44,036 --> 00:46:45,288
Even if

677
00:46:46,038 --> 00:46:47,665
it requires you to eat beans

678
00:46:48,666 --> 00:46:49,959
and spinach?

679
00:46:51,085 --> 00:46:54,881
Then, maybe next time, Father.

680
00:47:00,052 --> 00:47:03,723
All right. But why?
Is the challenge too steep for you now?

681
00:47:17,778 --> 00:47:20,239
FOUR TIGER SWORD

682
00:47:27,914 --> 00:47:29,373
He was spotted twice.

683
00:47:29,999 --> 00:47:31,667
But we can't find him.

684
00:47:32,585 --> 00:47:33,920
He disappeared somewhere.

685
00:47:34,879 --> 00:47:36,964
There's nothing but a bamboo forest
in that direction.

686
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:40,134
I know.

687
00:48:15,586 --> 00:48:17,171
Did you really come here?

688
00:48:19,465 --> 00:48:20,591
Why?

689
00:48:45,074 --> 00:48:47,660
JEONG TAE-EUL
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

690
00:48:52,832 --> 00:48:54,000
Your Majesty!

691
00:48:56,919 --> 00:48:58,087
Your Majesty!

692
00:49:00,047 --> 00:49:02,091
Head Court Lady Noh is upset again.

693
00:49:02,216 --> 00:49:04,427
She thinks you left the palace again...

694
00:49:25,114 --> 00:49:30,911
<i>2.71828182845904523536028747135...</i>

695
00:49:32,538 --> 00:49:34,081
She's searching everywhere.

696
00:49:35,541 --> 00:49:38,794
-You should at least tell her--
-Wait. Let me check how many seconds.

697
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,468
2.71828182845904523536028747135...

698
00:49:45,551 --> 00:49:46,635
What are you doing, Your Majesty?

699
00:49:48,012 --> 00:49:50,431
Time just stopped. It was the second time.

700
00:49:51,223 --> 00:49:52,308
Didn't you feel anything?

701
00:49:52,391 --> 00:49:53,893
Are you saying your watch stopped?

702
00:49:53,976 --> 00:49:55,519
Of course, the watch stops, too.

703
00:49:56,896 --> 00:49:57,938
Your Majesty.

704
00:49:58,856 --> 00:50:00,816
Where were you this time?

705
00:50:02,443 --> 00:50:03,652
A parallel universe.

706
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:05,821
Right...

707
00:50:06,739 --> 00:50:07,740
"A parallel universe"?

708
00:50:07,823 --> 00:50:09,450
Their capital city is Seoul,

709
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:12,161
and the statue of Yi Sun-sin
is in Gwanghwamun.

710
00:50:12,578 --> 00:50:14,914
Their country is called
the Republic of Korea.

711
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:20,920
So you went to the parallel universe

712
00:50:21,504 --> 00:50:23,089
where the capital city is Seoul,

713
00:50:23,589 --> 00:50:25,424
and it's called the Republic of Korea...

714
00:50:25,508 --> 00:50:27,426
Is the earth round or not?

715
00:50:29,512 --> 00:50:31,055
I'll ask for a doctor.

716
00:50:31,138 --> 00:50:32,098
Ma'am!

717
00:50:32,181 --> 00:50:34,433
-No, don't call Head Court Lady Noh.
-Head Court Lady Noh!

718
00:50:34,517 --> 00:50:35,684
Hey, Unbreakable Sword.

719
00:50:36,143 --> 00:50:36,977
Come here!

720
00:50:47,446 --> 00:50:50,032
What is the other world like?

721
00:50:50,866 --> 00:50:52,701
Between the two worlds, which is better?

722
00:50:59,583 --> 00:51:01,418
<i>REAR EARTH ELEMENT</i>

723
00:51:01,502 --> 00:51:02,878
We don't have this book here.

724
00:51:02,962 --> 00:51:05,965
If you were going to bring something,
you should've brought some gold.

725
00:51:06,882 --> 00:51:08,342
You said I existed in that world too.

726
00:51:09,718 --> 00:51:11,095
I don't need this.

727
00:51:12,054 --> 00:51:14,932
Just make sure not to favor either
him or me over the other when it's over.

728
00:51:17,726 --> 00:51:19,770
You in the other world
told me to give you the book.

729
00:51:20,855 --> 00:51:22,565
You on the other side

730
00:51:23,732 --> 00:51:24,859
runs a bookstore.

731
00:51:44,962 --> 00:51:46,839
You go to the charnel house very often.

732
00:51:47,298 --> 00:51:48,799
It's for myself.

733
00:51:49,884 --> 00:51:52,303
Who knows when I might die?

734
00:51:53,888 --> 00:51:55,514
Although, it looks like you'll never die.

735
00:51:56,682 --> 00:51:58,350
You'll have to eat dinner by yourself.

736
00:51:59,101 --> 00:52:00,019
Or you could eat out.

737
00:52:05,107 --> 00:52:06,567
What's the matter with you?

738
00:52:07,067 --> 00:52:09,278
Why don't you ever age?

739
00:52:36,847 --> 00:52:37,848
At ease.

740
00:53:45,749 --> 00:53:48,711
AUTOPSY REPORT

741
00:53:48,794 --> 00:53:50,921
LEE JONG-IN

742
00:54:14,778 --> 00:54:17,156
<i>-Yes, Your Majesty.</i>
-Did I get any phone calls?

743
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:19,575
<i>From whom, Your Majesty?</i>

744
00:54:22,077 --> 00:54:22,911
Never mind.

745
00:54:23,871 --> 00:54:24,830
You can go home.

746
00:54:35,257 --> 00:54:36,300
Why aren't you going home?

747
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:39,595
Did Head Court Lady Noh
ask you to keep an eye on me?

748
00:54:39,678 --> 00:54:42,473
Yes. And Ho-pil is outside the window
if you must know.

749
00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:46,435
I'm telling you so you don't feel awkward
when you try to escape through the window.

750
00:55:02,409 --> 00:55:03,285
Okay.

751
00:55:03,369 --> 00:55:06,038
With a white top,
your face will stand out too much.

752
00:55:06,372 --> 00:55:09,458
We have clothes here,
so why don't you put on a jacket?

753
00:55:09,708 --> 00:55:10,793
Okay.

754
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:17,383
Good.

755
00:55:18,675 --> 00:55:20,469
-Now, let me take a picture.
-Hold on a second.

756
00:55:20,552 --> 00:55:21,595
Okay.

757
00:55:22,638 --> 00:55:23,847
Smile.

758
00:55:24,139 --> 00:55:25,724
All right. Here we go.

759
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,894
One, two, three.

760
00:55:30,604 --> 00:55:31,647
Let's take another one.

761
00:55:31,855 --> 00:55:33,941
One, two, three.

762
00:55:37,236 --> 00:55:40,030
REISSUE OF CIVIL SERVICE ID CARD

763
00:55:47,704 --> 00:55:50,165
LOST AFTER A FIERCE SCUFFLE WITH A SUSPECT

764
00:55:52,418 --> 00:55:53,335
Here.

765
00:55:55,754 --> 00:55:58,090
When will it be ready?

766
00:55:58,173 --> 00:56:02,052
Your ID card that I have
was issued on November 11, 2019.

767
00:56:02,136 --> 00:56:05,264
Around late October.
It will take about a week.

768
00:56:06,807 --> 00:56:10,978
Right? I don't have to wait
until November 11, do I?

769
00:56:12,062 --> 00:56:12,896
No.

770
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,233
All right. Thank you.

771
00:56:47,681 --> 00:56:49,141
<i>Time stopped for a bit just now.</i>

772
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,101
<i>Didn't you feel that?</i>

773
00:56:51,935 --> 00:56:53,562
<i>Everything stopped except for me.</i>

774
00:56:55,147 --> 00:56:57,941
But thanks to that,

775
00:56:58,567 --> 00:57:00,194
I saw something beautiful.

776
00:57:05,866 --> 00:57:07,159
What did he see?

777
00:57:32,518 --> 00:57:35,604
The proposed salary increase for
congressmen was sent back to the assembly.

778
00:57:35,854 --> 00:57:37,981
The Prime Minister won.

779
00:57:40,275 --> 00:57:41,443
You seem happy.

780
00:57:41,527 --> 00:57:42,778
Yes, Your Majesty.

781
00:57:43,111 --> 00:57:45,739
If she serves another term,
she won't be able to flirt with you.

782
00:57:49,535 --> 00:57:52,746
Are you worried
I might fall for Prime Minister Koo?

783
00:57:52,829 --> 00:57:53,956
To be honest,

784
00:57:54,831 --> 00:57:56,208
she's quite pretty.

785
00:57:58,460 --> 00:57:59,670
Don't worry.

786
00:58:00,921 --> 00:58:02,422
I know someone prettier.

787
00:58:03,549 --> 00:58:04,716
You do?

788
00:58:11,765 --> 00:58:13,850
What's wrong, Your Majesty?
Are you all right?

789
00:58:16,436 --> 00:58:18,230
-I want to have my shoulder checked.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

790
00:58:18,313 --> 00:58:19,731
I want only Yeong to see it.

791
00:58:21,275 --> 00:58:24,152
Don't worry, and don't tell
Head Court Lady Noh about this.

792
00:58:24,444 --> 00:58:25,696
I have Captain Jo with me.

793
00:58:27,864 --> 00:58:28,907
Yes, Your Majesty.

794
00:58:36,206 --> 00:58:38,333
Drop the act. You can't fool me.

795
00:58:38,917 --> 00:58:40,335
It really hurts.

796
00:58:40,502 --> 00:58:41,628
Take a look.

797
00:58:42,838 --> 00:58:43,755
Hurry.

798
00:58:48,969 --> 00:58:50,178
What is this?

799
00:58:50,679 --> 00:58:51,722
When did this start?

800
00:58:53,056 --> 00:58:54,099
Not long ago.

801
00:58:55,767 --> 00:58:56,685
What is going on?

802
00:58:56,768 --> 00:58:58,812
Please hang in there.
I will call the royal doctor.

803
00:59:20,208 --> 00:59:21,918
There's no record of calls and texts.

804
00:59:22,002 --> 00:59:23,378
It's an unregistered burner,

805
00:59:23,462 --> 00:59:26,298
so there are only three voice messages
recorded while it was kept.

806
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:28,592
Thanks to the service provider,
we got them here.

807
00:59:29,092 --> 00:59:30,469
It took more than two weeks

808
00:59:30,552 --> 00:59:32,387
because it was difficult to get
the service provider to cooperate.

809
00:59:33,805 --> 00:59:35,349
Lieutenant Park, you are the best.

810
00:59:35,766 --> 00:59:37,476
Thank you.

811
00:59:38,393 --> 00:59:39,603
Thank you.

812
00:59:42,981 --> 00:59:45,776
<i>From August 1st to 4th,

Is this not Lee Sang-do's phone?

820
01:00:07,756 --> 01:00:09,424
Why did you lose your ID card?

821
01:00:09,508 --> 01:00:11,885
Apparently, you lost it
after a fierce scuffle with a suspect.

822
01:00:14,012 --> 01:00:15,305
Right.

823
01:00:15,931 --> 01:00:16,807
Well...

824
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:19,726
I think it might have been

825
01:00:20,227 --> 01:00:22,229
the time your friend...

826
01:00:22,312 --> 01:00:23,355
Well done.

827
01:00:23,438 --> 01:00:25,857
How long have you been holding out
without the ID card?

828
01:00:26,108 --> 01:00:27,317
Don't you want a promotion?

829
01:00:27,401 --> 01:00:28,527
It hasn't been long.

830
01:00:28,819 --> 01:00:31,196
I was supposed to get it late October.
I just forgot about it.

831
01:00:31,279 --> 01:00:33,615
What do you mean late October?
It was issued today.

832
01:00:34,991 --> 01:00:35,992
Today?

833
01:00:46,837 --> 01:00:47,838
Today is...

834
01:00:49,464 --> 01:00:51,133
November 11?

835
01:00:51,591 --> 01:00:54,469
They said you were accidentally left out.
They said sorry.

836
01:00:54,553 --> 01:00:57,347
Right. Today is November 11.

837
01:00:58,932 --> 01:01:00,350
It's <i>garaetteok</i> day.

838
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:03,311
I love you.

839
01:01:06,606 --> 01:01:08,734
By the way, guys,
did you hear about the news?

840
01:01:09,067 --> 01:01:10,068
What news?

841
01:01:10,152 --> 01:01:11,778
There will be
this year's first snow today.

842
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:13,655
It's early this year, isn't it?

843
01:01:14,489 --> 01:01:17,492
Doesn't it feel like
some kind of a good omen?

844
01:01:17,576 --> 01:01:19,411
Doesn't it feel like an omen
of being scolded?

845
01:01:19,911 --> 01:01:20,996
I love you...

846
01:01:21,997 --> 01:01:24,624
It's okay you say that to Tae-eul,
but you owe me an apology.

847
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:40,515
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul
of Violent Crimes Division Three speaking.

848
01:01:40,599 --> 01:01:41,516
<i>It's me.</i>

849
01:01:41,641 --> 01:01:43,894
<i>I see you haven't gone home yet.
I'm relieved.</i>

850
01:01:47,981 --> 01:01:49,649
-What's wrong?
-What?

851
01:01:58,784 --> 01:02:00,076
Let me answer it.

852
01:02:04,206 --> 01:02:05,081
Hello?

853
01:02:05,165 --> 01:02:06,917
<i>You keep hanging up on me.</i>

854
01:02:08,043 --> 01:02:09,544
<i>Do you get off work late again?</i>

855
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,672
<i>I thought I'd go see you
since you might've waited for me.</i>

856
01:02:17,302 --> 01:02:18,220
I should get going.

857
01:03:39,467 --> 01:03:40,552
Where were you?

858
01:03:41,887 --> 01:03:42,929
My world.

859
01:03:43,013 --> 01:03:44,347
Don't lie to me.

860
01:03:45,557 --> 01:03:46,516
I really did.

861
01:03:46,933 --> 01:03:48,560
You don't even know your name,

862
01:03:49,603 --> 01:03:50,979
but you went home?

863
01:03:52,647 --> 01:03:54,733
As I said,
I never said I don't know my name.

864
01:03:55,692 --> 01:03:57,235
I just said you can't call my name.

865
01:04:00,071 --> 01:04:01,323
Then why did you come back?

866
01:04:02,032 --> 01:04:05,952
There's some money I have to pay back,
and I need two more stamps for my coupon.

867
01:04:07,412 --> 01:04:09,623
But I forgot to bring the coupon
because I was in a rush.

868
01:04:10,206 --> 01:04:11,458
And I was also wondering

869
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:13,418
if you were doing all right.

870
01:04:18,673 --> 01:04:20,675
Now that I've paid the money back
and saw you,

871
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:23,845
I should get going

872
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:25,555
because I sneaked out this time.

873
01:04:28,558 --> 01:04:29,809
Do you really have your house?

874
01:04:29,893 --> 01:04:31,353
I do.

875
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:34,230
I have a really big house.

876
01:04:34,314 --> 01:04:37,609
There are many rooms
and it has a great view of the ocean.

877
01:04:38,318 --> 01:04:39,527
And a large garden as well.

878
01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:46,076
I have one question.

879
01:04:47,869 --> 01:04:49,871
The picture on my ID card that you saw.

880
01:04:51,247 --> 01:04:52,457
In that picture,

881
01:04:54,417 --> 01:04:56,294
is my hair down or tied up?

882
01:04:58,630 --> 01:04:59,881
So it was today.

883
01:05:01,841 --> 01:05:03,969
Did you lose your ID card
while I was gone?

884
01:05:11,559 --> 01:05:13,103
That's why it was today.

885
01:05:15,397 --> 01:05:17,107
You got your ID card today.

886
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:19,359
Just answer my question.

887
01:05:20,735 --> 01:05:22,070
In the picture,

888
01:05:22,946 --> 01:05:25,323
is my hair down or tied up?

889
01:05:25,907 --> 01:05:26,908
It was tied up.

890
01:05:43,633 --> 01:05:44,509
Like this.

891
01:05:48,596 --> 01:05:51,182
What am I wearing in the picture?

892
01:05:53,018 --> 01:05:53,852
The uniform, right?

893
01:05:53,935 --> 01:05:54,936
No.

894
01:05:55,770 --> 01:05:57,772
Just a navy jacket.

895
01:06:00,025 --> 01:06:01,359
It can't be.

896
01:06:09,034 --> 01:06:10,452
Do you want to see for yourself?

897
01:06:12,996 --> 01:06:14,539
You can come with me now if you want.

898
01:06:18,585 --> 01:06:19,878
Come with you where?

899
01:06:40,023 --> 01:06:41,066
Come with me.

900
01:06:42,233 --> 01:06:43,151
To my world.

901
01:06:45,987 --> 01:06:47,989
If you're lying again, you are so dead.

902
01:06:49,449 --> 01:06:50,700
Where should I go?

903
01:06:51,201 --> 01:06:52,285
You can't get there by car.

904
01:07:17,268 --> 01:07:18,603
Hold the rope tightly.

905
01:07:21,106 --> 01:07:22,482
I will hold you.

906
01:07:23,441 --> 01:07:24,275
Giddy up!

907
01:07:49,884 --> 01:07:50,885
I must be crazy.

908
01:07:52,137 --> 01:07:53,638
We've been here before.

909
01:07:54,681 --> 01:07:56,266
I'll seriously kill you.

910
01:07:58,351 --> 01:07:59,811
You'll regret having said that.

911
01:08:00,311 --> 01:08:02,438
Whatever happens, don't get too startled.

912
01:08:03,648 --> 01:08:04,732
Just trust me.

913
01:08:07,569 --> 01:08:08,444
Giddy up!

914
01:09:15,762 --> 01:09:17,180
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

915
01:09:17,972 --> 01:09:20,225
I command the royal guards
to take ten steps back.

916
01:09:25,772 --> 01:09:26,773
You too, Yeong.

917
01:09:28,358 --> 01:09:29,651
She seems too shocked.

918
01:09:35,949 --> 01:09:38,368
Is he...

919
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:41,579
Yes.

920
01:09:42,455 --> 01:09:43,873
In your world, he's Eun-sup.

921
01:09:49,963 --> 01:09:51,005
See?

922
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:53,341
I was right, wasn't I?

923
01:10:07,981 --> 01:10:10,024
I'm the King of the Kingdom of Corea.

924
01:10:12,568 --> 01:10:14,279
And my name,
which I asked you not to call,

925
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:18,074
is Lee Gon.

926
01:10:35,805 --> 01:10:43,684

927
01:10:51,879 --> 01:10:54,048
Welcome to my palace.

928
01:10:54,632 --> 01:10:55,883
<i>I didn't want to leave you scared
all by yourself.</i>

929
01:10:55,966 --> 01:10:57,051
<i>It's just my type.</i>

930
01:10:57,134 --> 01:10:59,512
-What have you done to His Majesty?
-Lee Gon.

931
01:10:59,595 --> 01:11:01,931
-You've never dated anyone, have you?
-Yes, I have.

932
01:11:02,014 --> 01:11:04,058
<i>My goodness, gracious.</i>

933
01:11:04,141 --> 01:11:05,434
No photos together!

934
01:11:05,518 --> 01:11:06,352
<i>Who are you?</i>

935
01:11:06,519 --> 01:11:09,397
<i>Would you like to change
your miserable life?</i>

936
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:12,400
<i>Do you still have
the same recurring nightmares?</i>

937
01:11:12,483 --> 01:11:14,610
<i>He's Kang Sin-jae of the Kingdom of Corea.</i>

938
01:11:14,693 --> 01:11:16,862
Do you want to see if it works or not?

939
01:11:16,946 --> 01:11:18,239
<i>Don't you know me?</i>

940
01:11:18,322 --> 01:11:19,573
You know me as well?

941
01:11:19,657 --> 01:11:21,784
<i>I'm letting this go just
because you're his guest.</i>

942
01:11:21,867 --> 01:11:25,121
Who are you looking for in this world?

943
01:11:26,758 --> 01:11:29,424
