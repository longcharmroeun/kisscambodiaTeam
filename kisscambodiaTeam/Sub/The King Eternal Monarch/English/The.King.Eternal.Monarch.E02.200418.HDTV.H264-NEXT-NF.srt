00:00:00,156 --> 00:00:04,906
THE KING: ETERNAL MONARCH

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,508
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:06,617 --> 00:00:08,016
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,928
JEONG TAE-EUL
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

5
00:00:42,393 --> 00:00:43,353
What the hell

6
00:00:43,937 --> 00:00:45,730
do you think you're doing right now?

7
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,233
I've

8
00:00:51,444 --> 00:00:52,821
finally met you,

9
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,324
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

10
00:01:24,978 --> 00:01:26,688
What are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

11
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:28,439
Can't you see my ID card?

12
00:01:28,523 --> 00:01:30,150
I'm a police officer. What are you doing?

13
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:32,235
That was a greeting.

14
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:34,863
-What?
-Because I'm happy to see you.

15
00:01:35,446 --> 00:01:37,073
So, you were across the universe.

16
00:01:39,993 --> 00:01:41,369
You really existed.

17
00:01:43,913 --> 00:01:46,207
And after 25 years,
you're still a lieutenant.

18
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,796
LIEUTENANT JEONG TAE-EUL
BIRTHDATE: MAY 27TH, 1990

19
00:01:56,342 --> 00:01:57,343
How do you know my rank?

20
00:01:57,427 --> 00:01:59,012
I have been watching you for a long time.

21
00:01:59,888 --> 00:02:00,763
Although you may not believe me.

22
00:02:00,847 --> 00:02:02,765
If you knew I wouldn't believe you,
why would you say such bullshit?

23
00:02:03,641 --> 00:02:05,852
I will ask you again, sir.

24
00:02:06,394 --> 00:02:07,896
Show me your ID.

25
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:09,731
I'm afraid I can't.

26
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,151
-I don't have an ID.
-Why do you not have an ID?

27
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:14,319
Because I am

28
00:02:15,153 --> 00:02:15,987
who I am.

29
00:02:18,114 --> 00:02:19,657
I guess you won't believe this either.

30
00:02:21,284 --> 00:02:22,619
What the...

31
00:02:22,702 --> 00:02:25,830
It seems that my feelings are conveyed,
and you are confused,

32
00:02:25,914 --> 00:02:28,166
so I will sum up the current situation.

33
00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:30,752
I am the King of the Kingdom of Corea.

34
00:02:31,544 --> 00:02:33,588
I crossed the dimension
with lightning and thunder

35
00:02:33,671 --> 00:02:36,299
while chasing after a suspicious person
and arrived here.

36
00:02:36,382 --> 00:02:38,718
<i>I was confused for a while,</i>

37
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:40,929
<i>but after giving it some thought,</i>

38
00:02:41,888 --> 00:02:44,891
I came to the conclusion
that this is a parallel universe.

39
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,687
This is a parallel universe?

40
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:51,481
It is a bit different,
but let's not get into the details.

41
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,233
There's already one thing

42
00:02:53,858 --> 00:02:55,068
that makes a big difference.

43
00:02:58,446 --> 00:02:59,948
QUEEN YUNA
THE BEGINNING OF A NEW LEGEND

44
00:03:00,573 --> 00:03:03,243
It seems that this country
is ruled by a Queen in this universe.

45
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,703
And she seems to be pretty beloved.

46
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:08,665
We do love our Queen Yuna.

47
00:03:09,415 --> 00:03:11,084
She's loved by the whole nation.

48
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:12,502
Just like I am.

49
00:03:13,753 --> 00:03:16,172
Now, escort me to your Queen

50
00:03:16,256 --> 00:03:18,258
and give well-dried grass and water
to Maximus,

51
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,593
my seventh-grade official.

52
00:03:20,677 --> 00:03:22,804
How am I supposed to take you

53
00:03:22,971 --> 00:03:23,972
to Queen Yuna?

54
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:26,015
You've got to buy a ticket.

55
00:03:28,226 --> 00:03:30,770
There seems to be something wrong
with our conversation.

56
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,649
-Am I right?
-Now you're talking sense.

57
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,484
This is annoying.

58
00:03:37,026 --> 00:03:38,319
He must be a movie star.

59
00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:43,574
-He must be a celebrity.
-Take a picture of his face.

60
00:03:49,455 --> 00:03:51,958
So, you're saying

61
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,669
you came from a parallel universe,

62
00:03:55,753 --> 00:03:57,839
where you are
the King of the Kingdom of Corea.

63
00:03:58,965 --> 00:04:01,342
And there was lightning on your way here.

64
00:04:02,218 --> 00:04:04,178
And the horse is a seventh-grade official.

65
00:04:05,013 --> 00:04:07,015
Is that what you're saying now?

66
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:09,600
It looks like you don't understand
what a parallel universe is.

67
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:12,353
Did you not study science?

68
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:16,399
Who is this half-crazy bastard?

69
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,696
Is this what your personality is like?

70
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:23,197
Yes.

71
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:27,201
My personality has been like this
for about 30 years now.

72
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:28,578
Why?

73
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:30,788
I have never imagined it.

74
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:34,375
I thought you would rather be softer...

75
00:04:36,586 --> 00:04:37,462
This is new.

76
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:38,963
Sure.

77
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:40,798
Enough with the self-introduction.

78
00:04:41,257 --> 00:04:42,759
Let me introduce myself now.

79
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:50,808
You didn't show me your ID,
you violated the traffic law,

80
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:55,104
and you touched the body
of a police officer on duty. Right?

81
00:04:56,689 --> 00:05:00,068
You have the right to an attorney,
and you have the right to remain silent.

82
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,403
If you move, it will only hurt more.

83
00:05:07,784 --> 00:05:09,619
I am the King of the Kingdom of Corea--

84
00:05:10,453 --> 00:05:11,287
My arm.

85
00:05:11,621 --> 00:05:12,497
My arm.

86
00:05:13,206 --> 00:05:14,624
EPISODE 2

87
00:05:14,707 --> 00:05:16,250
FORENSIC SERVICE

88
00:05:22,507 --> 00:05:24,425
-What a handsome white horse.
-What is it?

89
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:26,344
-What's going on?
-It looks so pretty.

90
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:27,428
It makes a great photo.

91
00:05:27,512 --> 00:05:29,138
-Where did you come from?
-What's going on?

92
00:05:29,222 --> 00:05:30,932
-It looks great.
-It makes a great photo.

93
00:05:31,015 --> 00:05:33,226
-I haven't seen a real white horse.
-What's this?

94
00:05:35,311 --> 00:05:37,271
Let me ask you again.

95
00:05:37,897 --> 00:05:40,149
What's your name?

96
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:43,694
I can tell you,
but you cannot call me by that.

97
00:05:44,153 --> 00:05:45,446
That's my answer again.

98
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:47,490
The name is not supposed to be called.

99
00:05:47,573 --> 00:05:50,451
Then let's say it's Kim Gae-ddong
for convenience's sake.

100
00:05:50,535 --> 00:05:51,911
"Gae-ddong" as in dog poop?

101
00:05:54,205 --> 00:05:56,374
You could have called me
Hong Gil-dong or Mr. so-and-so.

102
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,709
And my family name isn't even Kim...

103
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:01,295
Mr. Kim Gae-ddong,
take out all your belongings

104
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:02,463
and put them here.

105
00:06:02,547 --> 00:06:05,216
If you disobey the order,
I will take them out myself.

106
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:17,895
I will check your belongings.

107
00:06:20,398 --> 00:06:21,482
THE KINGDOM OF COREA

108
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:31,784
Right, it was there too.

109
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,036
Think of it as the concern

110
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,623
of the Head Court Lady
over the Royal Ancestral Shrine.

111
00:06:37,707 --> 00:06:38,791
Good luck.

112
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,426
A 100 thousand won?

113
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,928
What's wrong? Don't you guys
have 100 thousand won bills here?

114
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:52,263
Did you play Monopoly yesterday?

115
00:06:52,555 --> 00:06:54,390
-Did you get to buy much land?
-Will you keep talking down to me?

116
00:06:54,474 --> 00:06:56,517
Kim Gae-ddong has been talking down to me
since Gwanghwamun.

117
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:57,894
I'm three years older than you.

118
00:06:57,977 --> 00:06:59,437
Does that matter right now?

119
00:07:00,188 --> 00:07:01,647
Goodness. It looks quite real.

120
00:07:03,191 --> 00:07:06,360
There's a chance that this can be
involved in crimes or fraud,

121
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:08,613
so I'm seizing it.

122
00:07:11,074 --> 00:07:12,283
Thank you.

123
00:07:12,992 --> 00:07:14,952
-When will we get the result?
-In about two hours.

124
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:18,372
Bring it to the office.

125
00:07:18,456 --> 00:07:20,041
Okay. I'll bring it to you straight away.

126
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:24,128
What's that?

127
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:28,007
You don't have an ID,
you failed to identify yourself,

128
00:07:28,257 --> 00:07:30,843
and you've been uncooperative with police.
You know that, right?

129
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,596
I need your cooperation
with the fingerprint identification.

130
00:07:35,014 --> 00:07:37,433
No one is allowed to touch my body.
Even you--

131
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:46,651
Don't think that you just overpowered me.

132
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,820
I have trained my body
with all kinds of exercises.

133
00:07:51,113 --> 00:07:52,490
You seem to not believe me.

134
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:54,951
I wish I get to prove it.

135
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:58,120
Rowing, horse-riding,
taekwondo, fencing, boxing...

136
00:08:12,176 --> 00:08:13,803
His Majesty went out again?

137
00:08:16,055 --> 00:08:17,014
Yes.

138
00:08:17,723 --> 00:08:20,393
He went out without permission again
in the early evening.

139
00:08:20,476 --> 00:08:22,603
I thought so since my security level

140
00:08:23,354 --> 00:08:24,438
has been elevated.

141
00:08:25,815 --> 00:08:27,108
Where has he gone this time?

142
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:29,443
Did he go see the ice cap again?

143
00:08:29,735 --> 00:08:31,112
No, not there.

144
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,322
He left all his winter clothes.

145
00:08:34,156 --> 00:08:37,493
This time, I have no clue.

146
00:08:38,744 --> 00:08:41,622
Captain Jo assumes that he disappeared

147
00:08:41,706 --> 00:08:44,834
through the bamboo forest
near the racetracks.

148
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:52,008
Just until this summer,
he was shameless about running away.

149
00:08:52,091 --> 00:08:54,594
This is no laughing matter.

150
00:08:54,885 --> 00:08:58,556
You should really knock some sense
into him this time.

151
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:01,225
Don't ask him if he had fun this time.

152
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:03,769
But that's my biggest interest.

153
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,230
So, what should we say this time?

154
00:09:06,689 --> 00:09:08,691
We've already used acute gastritis

155
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:11,360
and acne caused by the change of season.

156
00:09:13,237 --> 00:09:18,159
Why don't you use the method
that you used a year ago?

157
00:09:18,242 --> 00:09:19,785
Let's say he cooped himself up
in his study

158
00:09:19,869 --> 00:09:22,788
because he has math fever again.

159
00:09:23,372 --> 00:09:27,001
Let's say he even has the Prince over
to help him solve math problems.

160
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,756
I guess I should stay here
for a few hours.

161
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,924
Looks like we will have
another rush of applicants

162
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:35,092
for science and engineering.

163
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:37,553
This is so frustrating.

164
00:09:38,638 --> 00:09:43,351
Captain Jo said he's searching,
so let's hope he finds something.

165
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:04,038
The CCTVs caught him pass by
the sixth point but not the seventh point.

166
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:07,750
The only thing that is between the two
is this bamboo forest

167
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,669
but the footprints stop here.

168
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:15,424
It means he disappeared here,

169
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:17,551
which makes no sense.

170
00:10:18,177 --> 00:10:21,013
I will check the CCTV footage again
to make sure we didn't miss anything

171
00:10:21,097 --> 00:10:22,264
and search again.

172
00:10:22,348 --> 00:10:23,307
Right.

173
00:10:23,474 --> 00:10:24,433
That makes sense.

174
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:28,771
It's either you missed something,
or I missed what you missed.

175
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:31,857
You two take care of it.
Just the two of you.

176
00:10:31,941 --> 00:10:33,734
-You know what I mean.
-Yes.

177
00:10:33,818 --> 00:10:36,278
I will be on outside duty,
so call me to keep me updated.

178
00:10:38,531 --> 00:10:39,365
Right.

179
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:44,412
You said His Majesty went to check
if it's a clock or rabbit, right?

180
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:45,830
Yes.

181
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:48,332
Seriously, we are innocent.

182
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,461
We had no idea that His Majesty was there.

183
00:10:52,545 --> 00:10:54,880
We were just trying to catch the bitch
that ran away with our boss' money

184
00:10:54,964 --> 00:10:56,048
and ended up there.

185
00:10:56,132 --> 00:10:57,466
-That's what happened.
-Hey.

186
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:01,470
That bitch doesn't have
a home nor does she have an identity.

187
00:11:01,554 --> 00:11:04,223
We must get her while she's in our sight.
Otherwise, we can't.

188
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:06,976
Please be generous.

189
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:08,602
You see, we did some investigation

190
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:12,940
and what they said
mostly correspond to what happened.

191
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:15,276
-Did you find the woman they were chasing?
-Not yet.

192
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:17,111
We have our eyes on her too

193
00:11:17,194 --> 00:11:20,239
because she's committed
various crimes like theft and assault.

194
00:11:20,448 --> 00:11:22,783
But we don't know her face nor name.

195
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,536
We rather got tips from these guys.

196
00:11:25,911 --> 00:11:26,954
What is she called again?

197
00:11:27,037 --> 00:11:28,080
-Luna.
-Luna.

198
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:29,623
Luna, it is.

199
00:11:29,707 --> 00:11:31,917
I will call you as soon as we catch her.

200
00:11:32,001 --> 00:11:34,503
Please prepare
the CCTV footage of her as well.

201
00:11:34,587 --> 00:11:35,463
I will.

202
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:36,380
<i>Hey.</i>

203
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:39,550
Hey.

204
00:11:40,926 --> 00:11:42,261
Give me a cushion to sit on.

205
00:11:42,386 --> 00:11:43,804
Or at least a chair.

206
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:47,099
I have never sat on the floor before.

207
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:51,729
I know you can hear me.

208
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:54,106
Is he the person you talked about?
Prince Charming?

209
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:12,833
JO EUN-SUP

210
00:12:22,426 --> 00:12:23,302
Yeong.

211
00:12:24,637 --> 00:12:25,513
Isn't that you, Yeong?

212
00:12:26,222 --> 00:12:27,264
What's your problem?

213
00:12:30,476 --> 00:12:31,435
I'm here.

214
00:12:31,644 --> 00:12:32,520
This way.

215
00:12:34,647 --> 00:12:36,816
He says he's not a prince but a king.

216
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:39,151
-He says he can't sit on the floor.
-I see.

217
00:12:39,235 --> 00:12:40,569
See? I knew you could hear me.

218
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:48,702
Yeong, I had no idea
that you would follow me.

219
00:12:48,786 --> 00:12:50,287
He's a little scary.

220
00:12:51,455 --> 00:12:53,499
Director Jeong asked me
to pass this to Squad Three.

221
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:55,417
This...

222
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:57,294
is for the delivery.

223
00:13:03,843 --> 00:13:04,844
He's not

224
00:13:06,387 --> 00:13:07,555
Yeong.

225
00:13:09,557 --> 00:13:10,432
He's not.

226
00:13:10,516 --> 00:13:13,394
Yeong? You kept saying that name.
Who is that?

227
00:13:13,477 --> 00:13:14,603
My name is Jo Eun-sup.

228
00:13:14,687 --> 00:13:17,481
Why do you answer him? Don't talk to him.

229
00:13:17,565 --> 00:13:20,067
One should not ignore what others say.

230
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,819
There is a horse outside.

231
00:13:22,111 --> 00:13:24,321
It was one dashing horse.

232
00:13:25,281 --> 00:13:27,157
Are you the owner of the horse?

233
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,662
He's like King Arthur.
King Arthur rides a white horse, you know.

234
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:33,664
I loved that cartoon.

235
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:35,124
Did you see it?

236
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,209
Wait.

237
00:13:40,212 --> 00:13:41,589
My, look at that watch.

238
00:13:41,672 --> 00:13:42,548
What is it?

239
00:13:46,677 --> 00:13:48,762
At least you have good taste.

240
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:52,641
It's the only watch in this world
that was made

241
00:13:52,892 --> 00:13:55,978
to celebrate the first victory
of Maximus, my fine horse.

242
00:13:56,604 --> 00:13:57,438
Right.

243
00:13:58,022 --> 00:13:59,273
There are two worlds now.

244
00:14:01,025 --> 00:14:03,110
It's the only watch in two worlds.

245
00:14:03,694 --> 00:14:05,362
Yeong would have recognized right away

246
00:14:05,738 --> 00:14:08,574
that the accurate watch
doesn't go faster or slower

247
00:14:09,408 --> 00:14:11,160
even by one-tenth of a second.

248
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,287
I get it.

249
00:14:13,746 --> 00:14:15,372
He talks with elegance
just like his horse.

250
00:14:15,456 --> 00:14:17,583
I wish my horses were as elegant.

251
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,711
-I do have horses too, you know.
-You do?

252
00:14:21,754 --> 00:14:23,172
Horseradish, sawhorse,

253
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:25,299
Red Horse.

254
00:14:27,051 --> 00:14:28,093
Eun-sup.

255
00:14:30,471 --> 00:14:32,806
It's seven already. Aren't you going home?

256
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:35,059
Wait.

257
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:38,854
I didn't want to say this,

258
00:14:40,648 --> 00:14:43,359
but please lay it
on at least a piece of paper.

259
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:46,320
It has never been laid on the floor.

260
00:14:46,403 --> 00:14:48,113
He seems pretty ill.

261
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,908
This is why I told you not to talk to him.

262
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:53,369
I should get going.

263
00:14:57,915 --> 00:15:00,501
FORENSICS TEAM, GYEONG-RAN

264
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:02,753
You can't find his identity? At all?

265
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,798
Are you saying he's an unidentified man?

266
00:15:05,881 --> 00:15:07,633
Even those who aren't registered anymore
have records.

267
00:15:07,716 --> 00:15:10,260
I know. But we found nothing.

268
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:13,555
I haven't seen any adult over 30
whose fingerprints aren't registered.

269
00:15:14,056 --> 00:15:17,685
It's a rare case,
but there's a chance that he was a child

270
00:15:17,768 --> 00:15:19,812
that went missing
before registering his fingerprints.

271
00:15:21,897 --> 00:15:24,233
Take his DNA sample and send it
to the Women and Juvenile Division.

272
00:15:24,316 --> 00:15:26,819
And I will have to take a look
at the flier once again.

273
00:15:26,902 --> 00:15:29,989
I don't know who made it,
but it looks like real money.

274
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:31,240
Good luck.

275
00:15:32,282 --> 00:15:33,367
Okay, bye.

276
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:37,121
Gosh, I dug my own grave.

277
00:15:38,414 --> 00:15:40,374
Seriously, who are you?

278
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:43,377
Open your mouth.

279
00:15:50,426 --> 00:15:51,969
You tried to identify my fingerprints,

280
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,221
but you failed to identify me.

281
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,306
Is that right?

282
00:15:56,849 --> 00:15:57,850
It means

283
00:15:57,933 --> 00:16:00,728
I don't exist in this world

284
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:05,899
and the two worlds
aren't exactly the same.

285
00:16:08,777 --> 00:16:11,196
Will you keep talking nonsense?

286
00:16:11,739 --> 00:16:13,949
-I said, "Open your mouth."
-Just like I don't exist here,

287
00:16:14,575 --> 00:16:16,035
you didn't exist in my world either.

288
00:16:16,827 --> 00:16:18,954
It took me a while to find you
and some effort to confirm it.

289
00:16:19,496 --> 00:16:21,457
Your affiliation was questionable

290
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:24,376
and a photo of you and your birthdate
was the only lead I had.

291
00:16:32,718 --> 00:16:33,761
A photo?

292
00:16:33,844 --> 00:16:36,055
Are you saying you have a photo of me?

293
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:38,766
Why?

294
00:16:38,849 --> 00:16:41,310
Why do you have a photo of me?

295
00:16:42,394 --> 00:16:45,230
Seriously, what are you?
You said this the moment you saw me.

296
00:16:45,314 --> 00:16:47,191
"I've finally met you."

297
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:49,485
Why did you finally meet me?

298
00:16:50,861 --> 00:16:52,446
You had better worry about your life.

299
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:55,449
Anyone who talks down to me like you,
gets beheaded.

300
00:16:58,118 --> 00:16:59,369
Are you a spy?

301
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,830
Is your mission
to explode this police station?

302
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:06,376
-Is that why you secretly investigated me?
-You don't look that important...

303
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,712
-Do you know me?
-I was curious about you,

304
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:10,589
and I thought about you a lot.

305
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,716
You also look better in real life.

306
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:21,809
That young man is the Captain
of the Royal Guards in my world.

307
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:24,603
Some people don't exist
in both worlds like you and me.

308
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:28,273
So, this is a parallel world?

309
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:29,983
Prove it.

310
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:31,652
The proof is right in front of you.

311
00:17:32,694 --> 00:17:34,238
I came

312
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,448
from the other world.

313
00:17:48,627 --> 00:17:49,670
Why

314
00:17:51,046 --> 00:17:52,506
do you look at me like that?

315
00:17:53,423 --> 00:17:54,424
How else should I look at you?

316
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:56,051
You must make sure
they don't give me the wrong idea.

317
00:17:57,136 --> 00:17:59,054
Right now,
your eyes are those of a criminal.

318
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:00,222
A petty criminal.

319
00:18:01,557 --> 00:18:04,017
-You don't have other proofs, do you?
-Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

320
00:18:05,394 --> 00:18:08,021
To help you understand,
I will give you a simple explanation.

321
00:18:08,105 --> 00:18:09,148
So, listen carefully.

322
00:18:10,482 --> 00:18:14,194
Quantum mechanics
that Albert Einstein discovered...

323
00:18:17,573 --> 00:18:18,532
You know,

324
00:18:18,615 --> 00:18:21,410
I don't know about other things,
but I know my eyes are charming.

325
00:18:21,493 --> 00:18:22,828
I was born with deep-set eyes.

326
00:18:22,911 --> 00:18:26,623
What about the quantum mechanics
that Albert Einstein discovered?

327
00:18:26,748 --> 00:18:28,375
Did the mechanics fix a car or something?

328
00:18:36,341 --> 00:18:39,261
Quantum mechanics
that Albert Einstein discovered

329
00:18:39,678 --> 00:18:41,388
led to the parallel universe theory.

330
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:45,267
The theory where our universe
consists of particles

331
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:48,061
and can exist in two places

332
00:18:48,604 --> 00:18:50,189
if particles that form substances

333
00:18:50,772 --> 00:18:52,524
can be waves as well

334
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:56,111
just like light can be both waves

335
00:18:56,195 --> 00:18:58,488
and particles at the same time

336
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:02,367
and therefore suggest the possibility
of the existence of parallel universes.

337
00:19:08,498 --> 00:19:09,625
I guess that didn't help.

338
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,087
The theory where our universe--

339
00:19:19,301 --> 00:19:20,802
Thanks for the speech.

340
00:19:23,388 --> 00:19:25,599
They are all Idiots.

341
00:19:25,682 --> 00:19:28,810
I thought I would see only gorgeous men
once I become the prime minister.

342
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:30,312
But you...

343
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:37,861
But you formed the cabinet.

344
00:19:38,654 --> 00:19:39,905
I know.

345
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,825
I chose them to shoot in the foot.

346
00:19:44,576 --> 00:19:46,662
-So, that was it for today, right?
-Yes, ma'am.

347
00:19:47,913 --> 00:19:49,248
I will see you tomorrow.

348
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:02,594
Is the article on
the state administration published?

349
00:20:02,678 --> 00:20:03,762
Yes.

350
00:20:06,848 --> 00:20:07,724
Here.

351
00:20:09,184 --> 00:20:10,769
And starting from tomorrow,

352
00:20:10,852 --> 00:20:12,562
the schedule of His Majesty
is open for a week.

353
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:13,647
So, I had a look into it

354
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,358
and the security level for Prince Buyeong
has elevated, as expected.

355
00:20:17,693 --> 00:20:19,027
So, the King ran off again.

356
00:20:25,242 --> 00:20:26,827
Maybe he has a woman.

357
00:20:27,494 --> 00:20:28,912
That woman is here.

358
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:31,456
If the King has a woman,
that woman has to be me.

359
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,126
I'm trying to make
the whole nation believe that,

360
00:20:34,251 --> 00:20:36,169
so it would be bad
if he has another woman.

361
00:20:36,253 --> 00:20:38,505
Is she young? Is she pretty?

362
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:41,883
The chance must be pretty high.

363
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:43,885
Get out.

364
00:20:44,303 --> 00:20:45,137
Yes, ma'am.

365
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:03,322
THESE ARE THE FACES
OF THE KINGDOM OF COREA

366
00:21:03,405 --> 00:21:04,656
THEY LOOK CUTE TOGETHER

367
00:21:07,951 --> 00:21:09,911
IS THE KING AND THE PRIME MINISTER
ON A DATE?

368
00:21:09,995 --> 00:21:11,246
He was right.

369
00:21:13,332 --> 00:21:15,208
The left side of my face looks prettier.

370
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,213
The lipstick was a bit too much.

371
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,971
I'm letting you go because I'm a good cop.

372
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:29,056
Consider yourself lucky.

373
00:21:29,139 --> 00:21:31,058
I was bound to be freed
after 48 hours anyway

374
00:21:31,183 --> 00:21:32,559
because there's no reason to arrest me.

375
00:21:32,642 --> 00:21:34,436
Yes, but you got out earlier.

376
00:21:35,687 --> 00:21:38,273
How can I contact you
when I get the DNA test result?

377
00:21:38,357 --> 00:21:39,274
Right.

378
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:40,901
Well...

379
00:21:48,658 --> 00:21:50,035
You can contact me here.

380
00:21:50,285 --> 00:21:52,037
I heard this was near your place.

381
00:21:52,621 --> 00:21:53,538
Who says that?

382
00:21:53,622 --> 00:21:54,706
That young man from earlier.

383
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,624
ROYAL INFINITY HOTEL

384
00:21:55,707 --> 00:21:57,667
Was his name Eun-sup?

385
00:21:58,627 --> 00:22:00,504
I heard he was your junior in high school.

386
00:22:00,837 --> 00:22:04,091
And I also heard that your father runs
a taekwondo center.

387
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:08,553
Do you even know
how expensive this hotel is?

388
00:22:08,637 --> 00:22:10,305
This is a five-star hotel.

389
00:22:10,764 --> 00:22:12,766
-Do you have money?
-I don't, but I can get some.

390
00:22:14,142 --> 00:22:16,186
Where's the nearest jewelry shop
around here?

391
00:22:20,732 --> 00:22:22,818
This is a diamond.

392
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:24,820
It's a diamond?

393
00:22:26,113 --> 00:22:28,782
If that's a diamond, I'm Princess Diana.

394
00:22:32,536 --> 00:22:34,704
I have been a gemologist for 40 years

395
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:37,958
and I haven't seen a diamond
with such delicate cuts.

396
00:22:39,376 --> 00:22:43,088
I would say
it practically has no inclusions at all.

397
00:22:43,505 --> 00:22:45,006
Goodness.

398
00:22:46,925 --> 00:22:48,552
Where did you get this?

399
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:50,720
I will ask where they bought it later.

400
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:52,889
The Head Court Lady is in charge.

401
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:55,767
How much can you give me?

402
00:22:55,851 --> 00:22:56,893
Well...

403
00:22:57,269 --> 00:23:00,397
It's a fine product,
but there's no warranty.

404
00:23:00,564 --> 00:23:04,359
And a fine diamond like this
includes risks.

405
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:08,655
JEONG TAE-EUL
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

406
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:11,032
Are you a cop?

407
00:23:11,116 --> 00:23:12,033
Yes.

408
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:16,371
Why don't you tell him
about your other identity?

409
00:23:16,455 --> 00:23:17,622
Princess Diana.

410
00:23:32,137 --> 00:23:33,430
You seem confused.

411
00:23:35,182 --> 00:23:36,808
So, what's with the diamond?

412
00:23:38,101 --> 00:23:39,144
Did you steal it?

413
00:23:40,937 --> 00:23:42,689
Have you seen anyone who accompanies a cop

414
00:23:42,772 --> 00:23:44,608
when trying to sell a stolen diamond?

415
00:23:48,695 --> 00:23:52,157
Who knows?
Maybe that Head Court Lady or whatever

416
00:23:52,365 --> 00:23:53,533
stole it.

417
00:23:53,617 --> 00:23:55,869
I will ask her that too.

418
00:23:57,579 --> 00:23:59,247
She's not the kind of person though.

419
00:24:03,668 --> 00:24:05,045
What is that, by the way?

420
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,421
Princess Diana.

421
00:24:10,592 --> 00:24:12,135
It's the 63 building.

422
00:24:13,094 --> 00:24:13,970
Why?

423
00:24:14,596 --> 00:24:16,389
Does your world
not have something like that?

424
00:24:17,516 --> 00:24:20,602
We have 63 of that in Haeundae.

425
00:24:20,685 --> 00:24:23,104
-Is that the only one here?
-Yes, it's the only one.

426
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,191
You can take a taxi across the road
to get to the hotel.

427
00:24:30,362 --> 00:24:31,279
Are you leaving?

428
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:33,365
Why?

429
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:35,617
Don't go.

430
00:24:37,244 --> 00:24:40,705
It took 25 years for me to meet you.

431
00:24:43,124 --> 00:24:44,334
I wish

432
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,420
today will be a long day.

433
00:24:48,338 --> 00:24:49,798
Get out of my way, will you?

434
00:24:50,507 --> 00:24:52,717
I already had a long day today
because of Kim Gae-ddong.

435
00:24:58,723 --> 00:25:00,976
LEE SANG-DO'S WIFE, TESTIFIER

436
00:25:02,686 --> 00:25:03,728
Hello?

437
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,856
Is this Mr. Lee Sang-do's wife?

438
00:25:08,692 --> 00:25:11,528
Yes, I can. I will be right there.

439
00:25:15,031 --> 00:25:17,742
Hey, Lee Sang-do's wife
answered the phone.

440
00:25:17,826 --> 00:25:19,327
Okay. See you at the hardware store.

441
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,836
I think it's been about three weeks
since my husband left home.

442
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:33,049
Why did you not report him missing then?

443
00:25:33,508 --> 00:25:36,428
It's not like this is the first time
he ran away from home after we fought.

444
00:25:37,345 --> 00:25:39,139
I just thought he might
be gambling somewhere.

445
00:25:40,515 --> 00:25:42,350
This time, it lasted a bit longer though.

446
00:25:44,561 --> 00:25:47,814
Is there anyone
who might hold a grudge against him?

447
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:49,608
To be honest,

448
00:25:50,734 --> 00:25:53,528
whoever killed him, it would make sense.

449
00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:57,824
He borrowed money from everyone he knew.

450
00:25:58,241 --> 00:26:02,495
He borrowed money from everyone,
carrying two phones around.

451
00:26:03,204 --> 00:26:05,206
Now I have to pay for all the debt...

452
00:26:33,652 --> 00:26:36,613
My, she grew by leaps and bounds.

453
00:26:43,912 --> 00:26:45,455
-Hello?
-<i>This is a collect call.</i>

454
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:46,414
<i>Eun-sup,</i>

455
00:26:46,998 --> 00:26:48,750
<i>it's me, King Arthur.</i>

456
00:26:49,209 --> 00:26:51,586
<i>Please pick up the phone.
I need to talk to you.</i>

457
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:54,798
<i>If you wish to continue the phone call,
press the pound key.</i>

458
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,549
He's out of his mind.

459
00:27:01,304 --> 00:27:02,389
Come in.

460
00:27:03,431 --> 00:27:04,391
Wow.

461
00:27:04,474 --> 00:27:08,353
I'm glad I managed to convince you
after 13 attempts.

462
00:27:08,478 --> 00:27:10,271
This suite is awesome.

463
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,483
By the way,

464
00:27:15,068 --> 00:27:16,778
why did you bring me here?

465
00:27:16,861 --> 00:27:18,697
I wanted to catch up with you.

466
00:27:19,322 --> 00:27:20,365
"Catch up"?

467
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,784
I've got nothing to catch up on with you.

468
00:27:24,244 --> 00:27:26,705
Everything in your left hand is all yours.

469
00:27:26,788 --> 00:27:28,415
Do you want me to sit over there?

470
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,376
So, what should we begin with?

471
00:27:32,085 --> 00:27:33,586
I want to see a photo of your family.

472
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:36,339
It would be better if it was from
when you were very young.

473
00:27:37,173 --> 00:27:40,844
Most people usually don't carry around
photos like that,

474
00:27:41,428 --> 00:27:43,847
but I looked the best then.

475
00:27:44,055 --> 00:27:45,140
Hold on.

476
00:27:45,223 --> 00:27:46,266
All right.

477
00:27:47,517 --> 00:27:50,145
Where is the photo of my life?

478
00:27:51,062 --> 00:27:53,273
There it is.

479
00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:56,109
Why do you want to see the photo though?

480
00:28:00,363 --> 00:28:01,489
I was right.

481
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:05,660
This is a parallel world.

482
00:28:07,996 --> 00:28:09,539
<i>Hey, do you want to die?</i>

483
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,001
<i>Answer your phone before I kill you.</i>

484
00:28:13,501 --> 00:28:15,086
<i>You freak. A horse?</i>

485
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,172
<i>Are you serious? You told him, didn't you?</i>

486
00:28:17,756 --> 00:28:19,716
<i>Pick up the phone already,
or I will kill you.</i>

487
00:28:19,924 --> 00:28:22,385
<i>Answer me! You are so dead.</i>

488
00:28:25,847 --> 00:28:27,307
Someone is texting you.

489
00:28:28,308 --> 00:28:29,476
A warning of murder.

490
00:28:38,151 --> 00:28:40,445
<i>I heard you had a broad yard.</i>

491
00:28:40,862 --> 00:28:43,865
<i>Please take good care of Maximus,
my seventh-grade official.</i>

492
00:28:44,032 --> 00:28:46,242
What in the world is this?

493
00:28:46,326 --> 00:28:47,911
It doesn't make any sense.

494
00:28:47,994 --> 00:28:48,953
It looks so well-fed.

495
00:28:50,205 --> 00:28:52,707
It doesn't seem to be a regular horse.

496
00:28:53,416 --> 00:28:56,044
-It's a seventh-grade official.
-I knew it.

497
00:28:56,127 --> 00:28:59,214
Tae-eul, are you sure the man
who left this horse is the owner?

498
00:28:59,798 --> 00:29:02,008
If he is, let's not let him go.
You must not let him go.

499
00:29:02,091 --> 00:29:04,594
Not many people in Korea own horses.
He must be incredibly rich.

500
00:29:04,677 --> 00:29:06,179
-Is that so?
-Yes.

501
00:29:06,262 --> 00:29:09,015
See that? Old sayings are always right.

502
00:29:09,098 --> 00:29:11,267
"Nice horses for nice horses."

503
00:29:11,893 --> 00:29:14,395
"Soft horse turns away wrath."

504
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:15,647
That's right.

505
00:29:16,147 --> 00:29:18,066
It sounds somewhat off though.

506
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:19,734
-Delivery!
-What do you mean?

507
00:29:19,818 --> 00:29:21,319
Hey, take a picture of it.

508
00:29:23,238 --> 00:29:25,240
Did you order fried chicken?

509
00:29:25,323 --> 00:29:26,241
-Yes.
-Delivery.

510
00:29:26,658 --> 00:29:27,742
Thank you.

511
00:29:28,284 --> 00:29:30,036
I ordered some food.
You should have some too.

512
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:32,997
-Come here.
-I have got no appetite.

513
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:37,168
Dang, I really am in trouble.

514
00:29:37,836 --> 00:29:39,212
Kim Gae-ddong!

515
00:29:41,005 --> 00:29:42,799
A moment of your time, please.

516
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:46,052
Has a well-built man
in his early thirties,

517
00:29:46,135 --> 00:29:48,304
around 187cm in height with a likable face

518
00:29:48,388 --> 00:29:50,139
checked in at this hotel today?

519
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,226
I'm sorry, but we are not permitted
to give out information on--

520
00:29:53,309 --> 00:29:54,394
Yes, I know.

521
00:29:54,936 --> 00:29:56,980
You don't need to tell me.

522
00:29:57,063 --> 00:29:58,273
Hold on a second, please.

523
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,782
<i>The horse you left at my place.</i>

524
00:30:07,866 --> 00:30:09,993
<i>I bet I can sell it for a good price.</i>

525
00:30:11,077 --> 00:30:12,537
<i>I'm giving you ten minutes.</i>

526
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:22,672
Please deliver this message to his room.

527
00:30:37,061 --> 00:30:39,606
That was nine minutes and forty seconds.
Close call.

528
00:30:40,565 --> 00:30:41,941
The suite is on the upper floors,

529
00:30:42,025 --> 00:30:44,027
so it took five minutes
for the manager to come up.

530
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,279
-I headed down as soon as I could.
-Sit.

531
00:30:46,362 --> 00:30:47,697
I was about to.

532
00:30:49,073 --> 00:30:51,534
Should I sit here like this?

533
00:30:52,577 --> 00:30:54,245
What are you going to do about the horse?

534
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,998
If it's okay with you--

535
00:30:57,081 --> 00:30:58,499
It's not okay with me.

536
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:00,543
I will feed him and brush him myself.

537
00:31:00,627 --> 00:31:01,753
Stop stating the obvious.

538
00:31:01,836 --> 00:31:03,046
Only for a while.

539
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,048
I can't stay here for long.

540
00:31:05,131 --> 00:31:06,966
I must return to my own world.

541
00:31:07,592 --> 00:31:11,596
Could you lend my dear Maximus
just 16 square meters of your lawn?

542
00:31:11,721 --> 00:31:15,058
Isn't that my entire lawn?
When are you going back to your world?

543
00:31:15,725 --> 00:31:16,684
I haven't decided yet.

544
00:31:16,768 --> 00:31:18,686
You should have done that first.

545
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,104
I should have,

546
00:31:21,105 --> 00:31:22,857
but I postponed it for later.

547
00:31:23,483 --> 00:31:24,442
I like

548
00:31:26,069 --> 00:31:27,570
being here with you like this.

549
00:31:33,493 --> 00:31:35,161
And you went shopping in the meanwhile?

550
00:31:38,206 --> 00:31:41,793
I was out shopping for Eun-sup,
and the clerk asked me to try it on.

551
00:31:41,876 --> 00:31:44,712
I tried it as I needed a change of clothes

552
00:31:47,465 --> 00:31:48,716
and it looked so good on me.

553
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,969
I wasn't asking a question.
It was an insult.

554
00:31:51,511 --> 00:31:52,345
Never mind.

555
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:55,890
I will look after the horse
until the DNA test result comes in.

556
00:31:55,974 --> 00:31:57,433
Why are you tying your hair?

557
00:31:57,934 --> 00:31:58,935
Don't tie your hair.

558
00:32:02,772 --> 00:32:03,773
Focus, will you?

559
00:32:04,941 --> 00:32:06,818
I'm going to look after your horse.

560
00:32:07,276 --> 00:32:08,778
Animals are innocent,

561
00:32:09,362 --> 00:32:12,156
but Kim Gae-ddong might not be.

562
00:32:13,658 --> 00:32:15,660
So, stay out of trouble until then.

563
00:32:15,743 --> 00:32:18,538
Unless you want to find out
how much your horse can sell for.

564
00:32:28,381 --> 00:32:29,549
That was scary.

565
00:32:32,552 --> 00:32:35,513
<i>The cause of death is
a blunt force trauma to the head.</i>

566
00:32:35,596 --> 00:32:37,181
The stage of rigor mortis shows

567
00:32:37,265 --> 00:32:39,267
that the body was disposed
in the trunk after death.

568
00:32:39,767 --> 00:32:43,021
Taking it into account
that the decaying process was quick

569
00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:45,189
since the body was in the trunk,
the death was three weeks ago.

570
00:32:45,273 --> 00:32:47,650
The victim Lee Sang-do left home
three weeks ago.

571
00:32:48,401 --> 00:32:50,236
Did you figure out
what weapon it was exactly?

572
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:53,197
Yes. One is the wound on the corpse

573
00:32:53,281 --> 00:32:54,907
and the other is that of the suspect,
Kim Bok-man.

574
00:32:55,783 --> 00:32:58,745
The two wounds are identical.
There's one weapon.

575
00:32:58,828 --> 00:33:00,455
It must be a tool that is quite heavy.

576
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,666
Could it be something like this?

577
00:33:06,794 --> 00:33:08,087
A lever?

578
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:10,757
I don't see why not.

579
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:13,968
It's often used
at the National Assembly too.

580
00:33:16,554 --> 00:33:18,556
Could this be

581
00:33:19,182 --> 00:33:20,850
what made these wounds?

582
00:33:21,851 --> 00:33:23,895
I guess it could be.

583
00:33:24,645 --> 00:33:26,355
-Let's find the weapon first.
-Okay.

584
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:31,110
BOTTLES, METAL, STYROFOAM

585
00:33:40,369 --> 00:33:41,329
Hello?

586
00:33:41,412 --> 00:33:43,956
<i>It seems that there's a food called
</i>budaejjigae<i> in your world.</i>

587
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,375
<i>I would like to try it.
If you are free sometime--</i>

588
00:33:51,589 --> 00:33:52,423
Hello?

589
00:33:52,507 --> 00:33:54,092
<i>I'm in front of the Gyeongbokgung Palace.</i>

590
00:33:54,592 --> 00:33:56,469
<i>And they happen to be reenacting
a royal event.</i>

591
00:33:56,552 --> 00:33:58,179
<i>Why do they say it's for the last king?</i>

592
00:33:58,262 --> 00:33:59,806
<i>Did something happen to Queen Yuna--</i>

593
00:34:02,266 --> 00:34:03,476
Hello?

594
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:05,561
I just discovered
something very interesting.

595
00:34:06,354 --> 00:34:08,189
It turns out that the bakery
that provides my pre-meal bread

596
00:34:08,564 --> 00:34:09,982
exists in this world too.

597
00:34:11,776 --> 00:34:12,902
What's odd is though,

598
00:34:13,444 --> 00:34:15,071
that everyone here is tasting--

599
00:34:23,996 --> 00:34:24,914
Excuse me.

600
00:34:25,164 --> 00:34:26,040
Thank you.

601
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:28,292
I wouldn't mind if you used it for longer.

602
00:34:29,293 --> 00:34:30,461
That would be dangerous.

603
00:34:30,545 --> 00:34:33,506
I suppose she's tying up her hair now.

604
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:34,882
I see.

605
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:37,677
I would like to have this one packed.

606
00:34:38,177 --> 00:34:39,720
This is a sample.

607
00:34:42,306 --> 00:34:43,266
Here.

608
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:44,225
No.

609
00:34:44,725 --> 00:34:45,852
I want this.

610
00:34:46,936 --> 00:34:47,812
Excuse me?

611
00:35:07,623 --> 00:35:12,336
I'm sure you have a good car, a secretary,

612
00:35:12,837 --> 00:35:15,089
and other better things to do.

613
00:35:15,548 --> 00:35:18,634
Why are you doing tough work like this?

614
00:35:19,844 --> 00:35:22,096
This <i>dancheong</i> has 300 years of history.

615
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:25,308
Painting over it like this

616
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:28,144
is as if I am covering it
with another history.

617
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:34,984
A history of my own.

618
00:35:35,067 --> 00:35:36,194
I see.

619
00:35:36,277 --> 00:35:37,695
That's why

620
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:42,575
your color seems to have depth.

621
00:36:04,935 --> 00:36:05,936
Good.

622
00:36:08,898 --> 00:36:11,650
Thank you so much
for coming to Myeong-ho's birthday party.

623
00:36:11,734 --> 00:36:14,111
Don't say that. We should thank you.

624
00:36:15,029 --> 00:36:15,905
It's fun.

625
00:36:19,033 --> 00:36:22,161
Okay. So, enjoy the food and have fun.

626
00:36:22,244 --> 00:36:24,371
Right. I got him a present.

627
00:36:29,418 --> 00:36:30,920
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

628
00:36:31,003 --> 00:36:32,004
Thank you.

629
00:36:33,631 --> 00:36:35,132
Hurry. Take a picture.

630
00:36:37,635 --> 00:36:39,178
Look at his face.

631
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,644
He looks ugly in this one.

632
00:36:48,521 --> 00:36:49,688
This one?

633
00:36:49,772 --> 00:36:54,318
It would be nice if you play soccer
with Myeong-ho one day.

634
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,072
Now, shall we blow out the candles?

635
00:36:58,155 --> 00:36:59,406
We were just about to leave now.

636
00:36:59,907 --> 00:37:01,617
We're going to play on a trampoline,

637
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,035
but Myeong-ho can't do that.

638
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:03,953
Let's go.

639
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,716
-I want to go to the toilet.
-Sure.

640
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,593
No, I can go by myself.

641
00:38:03,554 --> 00:38:05,222
I'm sorry.

642
00:38:05,598 --> 00:38:06,974
We were too loud, weren't we?

643
00:38:08,434 --> 00:38:10,019
What did you pray for?

644
00:38:11,228 --> 00:38:12,313
Well...

645
00:38:13,981 --> 00:38:15,566
I wish my son can...

646
00:38:22,948 --> 00:38:26,368
I wish my son can walk.

647
00:38:27,203 --> 00:38:29,079
That will not happen.

648
00:38:30,831 --> 00:38:35,085
Your child will never get to walk.

649
00:38:36,462 --> 00:38:37,296
However,

650
00:38:38,672 --> 00:38:41,759
you can make those children limp.

651
00:38:44,386 --> 00:38:47,598
Would you like to change the prayer?

652
00:38:55,814 --> 00:38:58,442
<i>Three elementary students
have been seriously injured</i>

653
00:38:58,525 --> 00:39:00,611
<i>by a truck while jaywalking.</i>

654
00:39:01,111 --> 00:39:04,073
<i>It is unlikely that the three students
will make a full recovery.</i>

655
00:39:04,615 --> 00:39:08,410
<i>We must review the speed limit
in school zones.</i>

656
00:39:08,494 --> 00:39:10,788
Is there a happy occasion to celebrate?

657
00:39:12,373 --> 00:39:13,249
Yes.

658
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:16,293
It's my dead son's birthday.

659
00:39:16,835 --> 00:39:19,296
I'm sorry.

660
00:39:23,717 --> 00:39:25,261
Why are you sorry?

661
00:39:26,428 --> 00:39:27,721
Just finish what you were doing.

662
00:39:52,788 --> 00:39:55,708
Ms. Song Jeong-hye, are you inside?
It's the police.

663
00:39:59,962 --> 00:40:01,922
I'm here because of your son, Ms. Song.

664
00:40:03,966 --> 00:40:05,301
Your son

665
00:40:07,177 --> 00:40:09,138
tripped at a reservoir and drowned.

666
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:12,391
Your husband was killed
by a hit-and-runner.

667
00:40:13,517 --> 00:40:14,852
Both your husband and son

668
00:40:15,602 --> 00:40:17,688
had suspicious deaths.

669
00:40:18,772 --> 00:40:20,232
Now, the whole world

670
00:40:21,442 --> 00:40:23,110
will accuse you.

671
00:40:27,573 --> 00:40:29,325
What do you want to do now?

672
00:40:31,327 --> 00:40:34,413
Do you want redemption?

673
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,643
<i>How pathetic you are.</i>

674
00:40:57,144 --> 00:40:58,437
<i>You've sinned by laughing once,</i>

675
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,277
<i>and now you can never laugh again.</i>

676
00:41:13,327 --> 00:41:19,041
LEE JI-HUN
OCTOBER 28, 1987 - DECEMBER 28, 1994

677
00:41:26,965 --> 00:41:29,802
This is the record of the blackmailing
text messages the victim sent you.

678
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:33,389
He sent dozens of messages a day,
saying things like you should watch out

679
00:41:33,555 --> 00:41:35,391
and he would kill you.

680
00:41:35,808 --> 00:41:38,727
He even found the address
to your apartment and blackmailed you.

681
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:48,362
Detective, you shouldn't let
such trivial texts fluster yourself.

682
00:41:49,238 --> 00:41:50,572
I didn't kill him.

683
00:41:51,281 --> 00:41:53,826
A bloodstain was detected in your place.

684
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:56,120
That's my blood.

685
00:41:56,203 --> 00:42:00,165
I was going home after drinking
and someone hit the back of my head.

686
00:42:00,249 --> 00:42:02,251
Is that so? When was that?

687
00:42:03,585 --> 00:42:07,798
Tell me the exact date, time,
and your whereabouts on that day.

688
00:42:09,842 --> 00:42:11,844
I think it was three weeks ago.

689
00:42:11,927 --> 00:42:13,595
Wait. Maybe it wasn't that long ago.

690
00:42:13,846 --> 00:42:15,264
Damn it. I don't know.

691
00:42:15,681 --> 00:42:17,933
When I regained consciousness,
I found myself at home.

692
00:42:18,016 --> 00:42:19,810
And the floor was all bloody,
so I wiped it.

693
00:42:22,813 --> 00:42:24,189
It's not your blood.

694
00:42:24,273 --> 00:42:26,316
It corresponds to the victim's DNA.

695
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:31,113
Lee Sang-do attacked you
with a weapon first and you murdered him

696
00:42:31,947 --> 00:42:33,073
with the weapon.

697
00:42:34,032 --> 00:42:35,409
Where is the weapon?

698
00:42:36,493 --> 00:42:39,663
What weapon? I didn't do it.

699
00:42:40,038 --> 00:42:43,000
Go ask at the bar.
I'm a regular customer there.

700
00:42:47,004 --> 00:42:49,506
NUMBER ONE

701
00:42:55,387 --> 00:42:56,263
Wait.

702
00:42:59,266 --> 00:43:00,684
It's Lee Sang-do.

703
00:43:05,564 --> 00:43:06,940
I checked the CCTV

704
00:43:07,024 --> 00:43:10,736
and it's certain that Lee Sang-do
followed Kim Bok-man three weeks ago.

705
00:43:10,819 --> 00:43:13,864
Lee Sang-do followed him
to the entrance of his apartment building

706
00:43:14,156 --> 00:43:16,200
and his whereabouts after that
is unconfirmed.

707
00:43:17,993 --> 00:43:20,078
There's nothing useful
from the CCTV of the apartment.

708
00:43:20,162 --> 00:43:21,079
The footage is kept only for a week.

709
00:43:22,581 --> 00:43:24,583
It seems pretty simple now.

710
00:43:24,666 --> 00:43:26,460
All we need to do is to find the weapon.

711
00:43:26,543 --> 00:43:27,586
The weapon?

712
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,546
It's ten. Let's go home.

713
00:43:30,045 --> 00:43:31,130
Okay, let's go home.

714
00:43:31,213 --> 00:43:32,047
Wait.

715
00:43:35,427 --> 00:43:38,514
How did an owner of the hardware store
who is just an ordinary man

716
00:43:39,473 --> 00:43:42,351
find Kim Bok-man's phone number
and home address?

717
00:43:44,561 --> 00:43:47,147
There's no information whatsoever
on Kim Bok-man's website.

718
00:43:48,065 --> 00:43:49,650
Why would he hire a private detective

719
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:51,985
when he had so much debt?

720
00:43:52,069 --> 00:43:54,071
I guess he didn't mind
having a little more debt.

721
00:43:54,363 --> 00:43:55,489
You see,

722
00:43:55,948 --> 00:43:59,910
when one loses money and loses their mind,
they can do anything.

723
00:43:59,993 --> 00:44:02,871
We might need to hire a private detective
ourselves to find the weapon.

724
00:44:02,955 --> 00:44:05,541
Tomorrow, we need to scavenge--

725
00:44:05,624 --> 00:44:07,459
That's a good point. Let's go home.

726
00:44:11,129 --> 00:44:12,172
Let's go home.

727
00:44:12,256 --> 00:44:13,423
Let's go.

728
00:44:29,856 --> 00:44:30,983
Open your mouth.

729
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:34,861
You seem like a high-class horse,
so I got an organic one.

730
00:44:37,197 --> 00:44:38,073
What's the matter?

731
00:44:38,156 --> 00:44:40,200
Is it not good enough
for a seventh-grade official?

732
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:42,077
Does it have to be fresh from the farm?

733
00:44:43,453 --> 00:44:44,621
My goodness.

734
00:44:49,001 --> 00:44:51,336
Why do I feel like you just got mad at me?

735
00:44:54,381 --> 00:44:56,258
Where's your owner?

736
00:45:05,642 --> 00:45:06,852
Hey, Eun-sup.

737
00:45:07,227 --> 00:45:08,520
Where are you now?

738
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,574
THE KOREAN WAR, A NATIONAL TRAGEDY

739
00:45:22,784 --> 00:45:24,870
He's been doing that for three days now.

740
00:45:25,037 --> 00:45:28,040
I gave him a cushion to sit on
and fed him after work.

741
00:45:29,374 --> 00:45:31,168
I will feed him today.

742
00:45:39,301 --> 00:45:40,469
Why is she sitting there?

743
00:45:42,471 --> 00:45:43,472
Is she his girlfriend?

744
00:45:43,555 --> 00:45:44,723
He had a girlfriend?

745
00:45:53,231 --> 00:45:55,734
<i>Are you from the Louvre Museum?
You're like a sculpture.</i>

746
00:45:55,817 --> 00:45:58,195
<i>A nation that forgets its past
has no future.</i>

747
00:45:58,278 --> 00:45:59,571
<i>Drink this and keep it up.</i>

748
00:45:59,655 --> 00:46:01,365
Most people here seem very kind.

749
00:46:02,074 --> 00:46:03,575
They kept giving me things like this.

750
00:46:04,951 --> 00:46:06,787
And I discovered something important.

751
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:09,581
In this world,
this country has a presidential system.

752
00:46:09,665 --> 00:46:10,916
Well done.

753
00:46:13,835 --> 00:46:14,711
She's leaving.

754
00:46:14,795 --> 00:46:15,837
Is he going with her?

755
00:46:17,255 --> 00:46:18,632
Please don't go.

756
00:46:18,715 --> 00:46:20,592
-Oh, no. Don't go.
-Please don't.

757
00:46:40,278 --> 00:46:41,405
Why aren't you eating?

758
00:46:41,488 --> 00:46:43,657
I don't eat food
that wasn't tasted beforehand.

759
00:46:43,824 --> 00:46:45,867
I could be poisoned anytime.

760
00:46:45,951 --> 00:46:48,120
Is that so?
Then how have you been eating food here?

761
00:46:48,203 --> 00:46:49,454
Eun-sup did it for me.

762
00:46:49,579 --> 00:46:51,123
You made him taste your food?

763
00:46:51,206 --> 00:46:53,750
I didn't even have to.
He always eats first.

764
00:46:53,834 --> 00:46:54,793
So,

765
00:46:55,585 --> 00:46:57,212
are you saying I should taste your food?

766
00:46:57,295 --> 00:46:58,171
No.

767
00:46:59,923 --> 00:47:01,967
If this food is poisoned
and I'm dying here,

768
00:47:02,676 --> 00:47:06,138
what I'm saying now will be my last words.

769
00:47:11,143 --> 00:47:12,227
Shoot.

770
00:47:13,603 --> 00:47:14,646
Thank you for everything.

771
00:47:16,398 --> 00:47:18,066
Because you existed somewhere,

772
00:47:19,276 --> 00:47:20,152
I was less lonely

773
00:47:21,445 --> 00:47:22,654
for the past 25 years.

774
00:47:44,885 --> 00:47:46,303
How can food

775
00:47:47,512 --> 00:47:48,722
taste like this?

776
00:47:49,139 --> 00:47:50,891
I haven't tasted anything like this.

777
00:47:50,974 --> 00:47:53,435
Do you not have any chicken in your world?

778
00:47:53,518 --> 00:47:55,854
We don't have ones
covered in sauce like this.

779
00:48:00,275 --> 00:48:03,111
It tastes excellent.

780
00:48:04,905 --> 00:48:06,323
What did you do in the library?

781
00:48:06,782 --> 00:48:08,742
I read about your world's history.

782
00:48:09,075 --> 00:48:11,077
I wanted to know how different it is
from that in my world.

783
00:48:11,161 --> 00:48:12,704
So, how is it different?

784
00:48:12,788 --> 00:48:15,499
The history of this country separated
since Prince Sohyeon.

785
00:48:16,374 --> 00:48:18,710
In your world, he passed away early

786
00:48:18,877 --> 00:48:21,379
while in my world,
he remained in history as King Yeongjong.

787
00:48:21,505 --> 00:48:23,089
He stopped the Qing invasion.

788
00:48:23,423 --> 00:48:26,301
The history of the two worlds
started to go separate ways since

789
00:48:26,468 --> 00:48:28,053
and ended up here now.

790
00:48:28,136 --> 00:48:30,388
It seemed that in your world,
the country has quickly grown

791
00:48:30,472 --> 00:48:33,016
through intensive industrialization
since the war and division.

792
00:48:33,892 --> 00:48:34,935
I was impressed.

793
00:48:35,018 --> 00:48:36,812
Do you write novels online?

794
00:48:37,562 --> 00:48:39,022
Is that what you wrote until now?

795
00:48:40,357 --> 00:48:41,858
<i>Do you think it's here?</i>

796
00:48:42,776 --> 00:48:45,904
<i>The reason why I survived that day.</i>

797
00:48:46,905 --> 00:48:51,368
Even on a night like that, a baby is born.

798
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:52,911
Isn't it great?

799
00:48:55,413 --> 00:48:57,165
That night,

800
00:48:58,834 --> 00:49:00,168
I heard the sound of a flute.

801
00:49:22,065 --> 00:49:24,276
Do you think
it was the sound of Manpasikjeok?

802
00:49:24,943 --> 00:49:26,152
No way.

803
00:49:27,028 --> 00:49:29,948
Manpasikjeok doesn't make any sound,
Your Majesty.

804
00:49:30,031 --> 00:49:31,283
That's not true.

805
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,994
I definitely heard it.

806
00:49:34,703 --> 00:49:36,496
That's why I went to Cheonjongo.

807
00:49:37,497 --> 00:49:39,541
I couldn't hear anything

808
00:49:40,417 --> 00:49:42,210
because the flute was too loud.

809
00:49:44,045 --> 00:49:45,630
I couldn't even hear the gunfire.

810
00:49:51,928 --> 00:49:55,015
I didn't know you remembered everything

811
00:49:56,349 --> 00:50:00,478
because you have never mentioned
what happened that day.

812
00:50:00,562 --> 00:50:04,024
I held onto two things

813
00:50:05,066 --> 00:50:06,484
that night.

814
00:50:07,277 --> 00:50:09,237
I'm asking if one of them

815
00:50:10,572 --> 00:50:13,909
is in the whip you are holding.

816
00:50:18,455 --> 00:50:22,417
Also, whether or not
you have the other one.

817
00:50:25,086 --> 00:50:26,338
That's right.

818
00:50:29,174 --> 00:50:32,385
I have been keeping it in secret

819
00:50:33,511 --> 00:50:37,390
and I brought it to give it back to you
despite my fear.

820
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:42,479
What an odd thing it is.

821
00:50:43,647 --> 00:50:45,941
Something that is silent made a sound

822
00:50:47,192 --> 00:50:50,362
and something
that cannot be identified exists.

823
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:56,743
Which is why I wished

824
00:50:57,661 --> 00:51:00,288
you had forgotten everything.

825
00:51:11,091 --> 00:51:14,552
Is this a secret between us?

826
00:51:16,054 --> 00:51:17,931
Yes, Your Majesty.

827
00:51:20,809 --> 00:51:21,977
JEONG TAE-EUL
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

828
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:23,353
Do you think it's here?

829
00:51:24,312 --> 00:51:25,313
The reason

830
00:51:26,731 --> 00:51:28,483
why I survived that day.

831
00:51:30,944 --> 00:51:34,030
Why do you never believe

832
00:51:35,198 --> 00:51:36,491
anything I say?

833
00:51:36,574 --> 00:51:37,993
Is that how belief works?

834
00:51:39,452 --> 00:51:41,746
Am I supposed to believe
nonsense just like that?

835
00:51:42,664 --> 00:51:45,500
I'm the type of person who still can't
believe the earth is round.

836
00:51:45,959 --> 00:51:47,794
But a parallel universe?

837
00:51:48,628 --> 00:51:49,796
Pre-meal bakery?

838
00:51:50,505 --> 00:51:52,298
Stop your nonsense
and eat before it gets cold.

839
00:51:53,299 --> 00:51:55,760
Just do one thing
before we get your DNA test result.

840
00:51:56,177 --> 00:51:57,429
Do nothing.

841
00:51:58,596 --> 00:52:00,473
If you don't believe me,
why do you help me?

842
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:03,059
Is it some kind of a sense of duty?

843
00:52:03,143 --> 00:52:05,020
You need that
only when you have to save the country.

844
00:52:05,854 --> 00:52:06,980
Then why?

845
00:52:07,063 --> 00:52:09,566
There's no reason. I just do it.

846
00:52:09,649 --> 00:52:11,443
I'm a police officer
of the Republic of Korea.

847
00:52:17,699 --> 00:52:18,950
Anything else?

848
00:52:20,702 --> 00:52:22,537
Is there any other reason?

849
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,999
The reason why
I have to stay in your world.

850
00:52:27,167 --> 00:52:28,501
Could there be a reason?

851
00:53:00,742 --> 00:53:03,870
EXHIBITION FROM KING TAEJO
TO THE LAST KING SUNJONG

852
00:53:58,842 --> 00:54:00,677
I just saw the White Rabbit
with the clock.

853
00:54:24,784 --> 00:54:26,870
Goodness. What was that?

854
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:29,873
Wait. You are Jo Yeong.

855
00:54:30,999 --> 00:54:32,417
Where did you buy this?

856
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,210
It's our class uniform.

857
00:54:34,294 --> 00:54:36,629
I suppose we ordered them online.

858
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:38,673
Please excuse me.

859
00:54:39,174 --> 00:54:40,967
Can I take a picture with you?

860
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:42,260
No.

861
00:54:49,851 --> 00:54:54,230
They said they would call me by today,
but I still didn't hear back.

862
00:54:54,564 --> 00:54:56,065
I guess it means I didn't pass.

863
00:54:56,357 --> 00:54:58,067
Where are you? Let's go grab a drink.

864
00:54:59,319 --> 00:55:00,653
Hang on a second.

865
00:55:02,322 --> 00:55:03,656
Hey, I will call you back.

866
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:05,617
THE ROYAL PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICE

867
00:55:07,785 --> 00:55:08,953
Hello?

868
00:55:09,495 --> 00:55:10,371
Yes.

869
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:12,165
That's me.

870
00:55:13,374 --> 00:55:15,627
The final interview? Really?

871
00:55:16,461 --> 00:55:17,295
Okay.

872
00:55:18,463 --> 00:55:19,464
Okay.

873
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:23,051
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

874
00:55:23,635 --> 00:55:26,930
Are you Ms. Myeong Seung-a?
I work for the Royal Guard--

875
00:55:27,013 --> 00:55:29,766
Jo Yeong. You're really him.
This is unbelievable.

876
00:55:29,849 --> 00:55:31,476
That's right. I'm Jo Yeong.

877
00:55:33,228 --> 00:55:36,564
Is this the camera that you were holding
at the rowing competition?

878
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,608
May I see the photos?

879
00:55:39,817 --> 00:55:40,652
What?

880
00:55:40,777 --> 00:55:43,196
Sure. Take a look. Here.

881
00:55:45,698 --> 00:55:48,451
Did you know I was here?

882
00:55:49,035 --> 00:55:50,411
Yes, I knew you were here.

883
00:55:50,495 --> 00:55:52,372
Oh, you did.

884
00:55:53,998 --> 00:55:54,916
How?

885
00:56:05,301 --> 00:56:06,552
Thanks for your cooperation.

886
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:10,014
Could you please send me
the photos by e-mail?

887
00:56:10,098 --> 00:56:11,015
Wow.

888
00:56:11,099 --> 00:56:13,434
I guess these photos are helpful.

889
00:56:13,518 --> 00:56:17,188
I don't know yet,
but I might find a clue later.

890
00:56:17,397 --> 00:56:18,982
Here's my e-mail address.

891
00:56:19,065 --> 00:56:20,483
He's so cool.

892
00:56:20,566 --> 00:56:21,651
I can hear you.

893
00:56:21,734 --> 00:56:22,860
Really?

894
00:56:38,543 --> 00:56:41,587
Did you investigate the assailants
from the rowing competition?

895
00:56:41,754 --> 00:56:45,591
Yes, but they seem irrelevant
to His Majesty's absence.

896
00:56:46,426 --> 00:56:48,344
I found one lead though.

897
00:56:48,469 --> 00:56:50,471
It's the woman that caused the incident.

898
00:56:50,722 --> 00:56:53,057
It seems that His Majesty
was after that woman as well.

899
00:56:53,224 --> 00:56:54,058
Wait.

900
00:56:54,934 --> 00:56:57,145
His Majesty was after whom?

901
00:56:57,812 --> 00:56:58,688
A woman?

902
00:56:59,856 --> 00:57:01,774
<i>I just saw the White Rabbit
with the clock.</i>

903
00:57:02,442 --> 00:57:04,110
It's just my suspicion.

904
00:57:04,235 --> 00:57:06,446
I will let you know
when I find concrete evidence.

905
00:57:08,364 --> 00:57:09,741
Make sure to make
a thorough investigation.

906
00:57:10,325 --> 00:57:11,284
Yes, ma'am.

907
00:57:11,367 --> 00:57:14,537
The talismans haven't been working,

908
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:19,000
so I was just about to go
and grab the shaman by the hair.

909
00:57:20,626 --> 00:57:22,795
I might end up bowing to her
to show my appreciation.

910
00:57:59,624 --> 00:58:01,209
One, two, three.

911
00:58:38,871 --> 00:58:41,082
I think that car owner will understand me.

912
00:58:44,293 --> 00:58:45,336
Welcome.

913
00:58:47,588 --> 00:58:48,965
Weren't you just in the yard?

914
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:52,385
Wait. Are you the owner of the horse?

915
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:56,764
It's nice to finally meet a citizen
who recognizes me.

916
00:58:57,432 --> 00:58:58,808
As you probably have assumed,

917
00:58:58,891 --> 00:59:00,768
I am the owner
of the seventh-grade official, Maximus,

918
00:59:00,852 --> 00:59:02,770
who is staying in the yard for a while.

919
00:59:02,854 --> 00:59:05,857
I am also
the King of the Kingdom of Corea.

920
00:59:06,441 --> 00:59:09,026
What an interesting character you have.

921
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:13,114
If you don't mind, I would like to have
a cup of tasted milk tea.

922
00:59:15,533 --> 00:59:17,118
It's 5,800 won and you need to pay first.

923
00:59:46,397 --> 00:59:48,399
Hey, I'm in the yard. Come on down.

924
00:59:51,694 --> 00:59:52,612
Give me five minutes.

925
00:59:54,489 --> 00:59:56,157
Were you home?

926
00:59:56,866 --> 00:59:59,744
<i>He appeared at the Gwanghwamun Junction,
on horseback.</i>

927
01:00:00,244 --> 01:00:03,247
He seemed a bit crazy
but he's good-looking.

928
01:00:03,331 --> 01:00:06,292
I found no one
that matches his fingerprints.

929
01:00:06,792 --> 01:00:07,877
But he was handsome.

930
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:11,255
I heard Tae-eul got herself into
a difficult situation with a handsome guy.

931
01:00:11,464 --> 01:00:12,548
Have you seen him?

932
01:00:13,382 --> 01:00:15,927
Hey, Eun-sup is waiting. You can go first.

933
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:17,553
I'll join you after hanging the laundry.

934
01:00:17,637 --> 01:00:19,847
What should we order? Half and half?

935
01:00:19,931 --> 01:00:21,516
-Hey, wait--
-Sounds great!

936
01:00:35,029 --> 01:00:36,614
I know I have just met you,

937
01:00:37,073 --> 01:00:40,743
but what exactly is the relationship
between you and Lieutenant Jeong?

938
01:00:40,826 --> 01:00:42,286
Container ship?

939
01:00:43,371 --> 01:00:45,164
Tanker ship?

940
01:00:45,331 --> 01:00:46,707
Passenger ship?

941
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:49,126
What do you mean?

942
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:51,504
If you know we just met,
then why do you say such bullshit?

943
01:00:52,088 --> 01:00:52,964
That's what I meant.

944
01:00:54,382 --> 01:00:55,633
Stand there.

945
01:01:00,179 --> 01:01:01,764
It's a mug shot. Just in case.

946
01:01:01,889 --> 01:01:03,057
I heard you're unidentified.

947
01:01:03,724 --> 01:01:04,559
Stand there.

948
01:01:07,645 --> 01:01:08,854
Are you crazy? What was that?

949
01:01:08,938 --> 01:01:10,606
Just in case you are my savior.

950
01:01:11,148 --> 01:01:13,568
I wished you weren't, and you aren't.

951
01:01:13,651 --> 01:01:14,902
Who is this crazy bastard?

952
01:01:14,986 --> 01:01:16,320
I've heard that many times
since my arrival.

953
01:01:16,404 --> 01:01:17,613
Although

954
01:01:18,406 --> 01:01:20,408
it doesn't mean you can say it though.

955
01:01:20,491 --> 01:01:23,661
Every word you say is beyond common sense.

956
01:01:23,744 --> 01:01:25,204
You had better watch what you say.

957
01:01:25,705 --> 01:01:26,914
Beheading is my kindest offer.

958
01:01:34,171 --> 01:01:36,215
What do you think
my kindest offer is then?

959
01:01:37,341 --> 01:01:40,344
I'm the kindest when I just met someone.

960
01:01:44,098 --> 01:01:48,519
Which means if I see you once again,
there will be more than just kind words.

961
01:01:57,528 --> 01:01:58,571
Yes, I'm coming.

962
01:02:03,659 --> 01:02:07,371
I still have no clue
what relationship he and Tae-eul has.

963
01:02:27,808 --> 01:02:29,018
<i>Father!</i>

964
01:02:29,727 --> 01:02:32,188
APRIL 2006

965
01:02:35,399 --> 01:02:38,110
Are we living in the Joseon era or what?

966
01:02:38,736 --> 01:02:41,072
How could you accept eggs for tuition?

967
01:02:43,783 --> 01:02:47,912
Well, Min-gu's family sells eggs

968
01:02:49,705 --> 01:02:51,499
and they have too many left this month.

969
01:02:52,708 --> 01:02:56,337
You know, it takes quite a while
to go to the supermarket to buy eggs.

970
01:02:57,922 --> 01:02:59,548
It's all protein.

971
01:03:00,508 --> 01:03:04,053
You're saying nonsense.

972
01:03:04,136 --> 01:03:06,180
How can you pay the rent
for the center with this?

973
01:03:06,263 --> 01:03:09,058
I told you that you should help the kids
with their homework.

974
01:03:09,642 --> 01:03:12,144
You can't teach
the five tenets of taekwondo.

975
01:03:12,353 --> 01:03:14,188
to the kids that want pink belts.

976
01:03:14,689 --> 01:03:16,023
By the way,

977
01:03:16,857 --> 01:03:19,527
why haven't you showed me the report card
from the mock exam in April?

978
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:20,653
Tell me.

979
01:03:21,404 --> 01:03:24,407
It's been four months
since you entered high school

980
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:26,617
and I haven't seen any report card.

981
01:03:36,752 --> 01:03:37,795
Father,

982
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:41,006
I have a good idea.

983
01:03:42,883 --> 01:03:44,385
It's a brilliant idea.

984
01:03:44,468 --> 01:03:46,762
The idea just crossed my mind

985
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,140
and I think it will work.

986
01:03:55,521 --> 01:03:57,982
-Want to play pool?
-You are so bad, but if you insist.

987
01:03:58,482 --> 01:04:00,276
Hey, you are the worst.

988
01:04:00,818 --> 01:04:01,694
Hey, wait.

989
01:04:09,702 --> 01:04:10,786
Let's go.

990
01:04:13,998 --> 01:04:15,082
<i>TAEKWONDO</i>

991
01:04:48,282 --> 01:04:49,158
It doesn't work.

992
01:04:49,241 --> 01:04:50,075
<i>-Taekwon!
-Taekwon!</i>

993
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:52,161
I told you I wanted to get
the double eyelid surgery.

994
01:04:52,495 --> 01:04:54,455
You will get them when you get older.

995
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,248
Do it properly.

996
01:04:57,333 --> 01:05:00,252
Keep holding up. Then you will get them.

997
01:05:01,045 --> 01:05:03,464
All right. Let's do it again. Taekwon!

998
01:05:03,547 --> 01:05:04,882
-Taekwon!
-Taekwon!

999
01:05:04,965 --> 01:05:07,051
Good. Let's do it again.
Keep your voice up.

1000
01:05:07,134 --> 01:05:08,010
Taekwon.

1001
01:05:08,093 --> 01:05:09,804
-Taekwon!
-Taekwon!

1002
01:05:17,686 --> 01:05:19,647
I told you it was a brilliant idea.

1003
01:05:27,446 --> 01:05:28,405
Someone actually came.

1004
01:05:29,573 --> 01:05:30,699
All right. At ease.

1005
01:05:31,367 --> 01:05:34,495
That's it for today. Let's take a bow.

1006
01:05:34,578 --> 01:05:38,624
-Thank you for the lesson.
-Thank you for the lesson.

1007
01:05:47,883 --> 01:05:48,884
What are you doing here?

1008
01:05:48,968 --> 01:05:51,804
I know what "half and half" means too.

1009
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:54,098
I'm coming with you.

1010
01:05:54,181 --> 01:05:55,307
No, you aren't.

1011
01:05:55,808 --> 01:05:58,102
Have quality time
with your seventh-grade official.

1012
01:06:18,873 --> 01:06:19,874
<i>Anything else?</i>

1013
01:06:21,417 --> 01:06:23,335
Is there any other reason?

1014
01:06:24,336 --> 01:06:26,589
The reason why
I have to stay in your world.

1015
01:06:28,132 --> 01:06:29,174
Could there be a reason?

1016
01:07:03,959 --> 01:07:07,212
Why are you still here?
Will you keep standing here?

1017
01:07:08,213 --> 01:07:09,048
You

1018
01:07:10,174 --> 01:07:11,592
really shouldn't treat me like this.

1019
01:07:11,675 --> 01:07:12,843
Why not?

1020
01:07:13,844 --> 01:07:15,054
Because it upsets me.

1021
01:07:16,305 --> 01:07:18,474
-What?
-Why would you leave me?

1022
01:07:18,557 --> 01:07:20,517
You are the only person I know
in this world.

1023
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,606
You are driving me crazy.

1024
01:07:27,066 --> 01:07:29,193
Fine. Since you brought it up,
let me ask you.

1025
01:07:29,526 --> 01:07:31,862
Why am I the only person you know
in this world?

1026
01:07:32,029 --> 01:07:34,865
You act like you know me,
but I don't know you.

1027
01:07:34,949 --> 01:07:36,825
How do you know me?

1028
01:07:36,909 --> 01:07:40,412
I acquired your ID card 25 years ago.

1029
01:07:41,205 --> 01:07:42,873
To be precise, someone lost it.

1030
01:07:43,624 --> 01:07:44,917
Twenty-five years ago?

1031
01:07:45,459 --> 01:07:46,377
Who lost it?

1032
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:49,296
I'm still looking for the person.
The person seems to be related to you.

1033
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:50,714
Of course.

1034
01:07:50,798 --> 01:07:54,009
If that person had my ID card,
they have to be related to me somehow.

1035
01:07:54,093 --> 01:07:56,345
Let's say what you are saying is true.

1036
01:07:56,428 --> 01:07:58,305
But 25 years ago,

1037
01:07:59,139 --> 01:08:00,182
I was only five.

1038
01:08:00,349 --> 01:08:03,936
Of course, I was more than qualified
to become a detective when I was five.

1039
01:08:04,019 --> 01:08:05,813
But still, you fool,

1040
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:08,524
how would someone
find my ID card 25 years ago?

1041
01:08:08,607 --> 01:08:11,485
I don't know why,
but your ID card that I have

1042
01:08:11,568 --> 01:08:13,696
was issued on November 11, 2019.

1043
01:08:14,196 --> 01:08:15,823
And I have been waiting for that day.

1044
01:08:19,493 --> 01:08:22,329
November 11?

1045
01:08:26,208 --> 01:08:27,751
That's Leonardo DiCaprio's birthday.

1046
01:08:30,254 --> 01:08:33,090
I totally forgot about him.

1047
01:08:34,258 --> 01:08:36,176
Were we just meant to be?

1048
01:08:38,971 --> 01:08:41,223
Hey, Mr. Kim Gae-ddong.

1049
01:08:41,932 --> 01:08:43,517
You're having delusions.

1050
01:08:44,727 --> 01:08:46,228
Seriously,

1051
01:08:47,396 --> 01:08:50,190
stop this and go see a doctor
with the money you got from the diamond.

1052
01:08:50,274 --> 01:08:51,525
I don't have any left.

1053
01:08:51,608 --> 01:08:53,152
Right. It's...

1054
01:08:55,904 --> 01:08:57,614
I'm not just saying this.

1055
01:08:57,948 --> 01:08:59,575
You must have a family

1056
01:09:00,117 --> 01:09:02,703
and they must be worried about you.

1057
01:09:03,579 --> 01:09:04,455
Family...

1058
01:09:09,251 --> 01:09:12,421
Is that what you wanted to know?

1059
01:09:12,504 --> 01:09:14,131
Yes, it is.

1060
01:09:14,214 --> 01:09:15,174
Okay, then.

1061
01:09:15,549 --> 01:09:16,550
I will give you an answer.

1062
01:09:18,886 --> 01:09:20,220
I'm still single.

1063
01:09:22,639 --> 01:09:24,058
What are you trying to say?

1064
01:09:24,141 --> 01:09:26,143
Which means
I don't have any immediate family.

1065
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:29,605
Therefore, I have just made
a very important decision.

1066
01:09:30,814 --> 01:09:34,818
I am going to give you the position
where you have to know who I am.

1067
01:09:35,778 --> 01:09:36,653
Fine.

1068
01:09:37,196 --> 01:09:38,614
Give it to me. What is it?

1069
01:09:39,656 --> 01:09:41,533
I wish I could understand you.

1070
01:09:55,756 --> 01:09:56,757
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

1071
01:09:59,468 --> 01:10:00,594
I take you

1072
01:10:02,554 --> 01:10:03,972
to be my wife, the Queen.

1073
01:10:05,849 --> 01:10:08,268
-What?
-You just became the reason.

1074
01:10:10,062 --> 01:10:11,021
The reason

1075
01:10:12,898 --> 01:10:14,399
why I should stay in this world.

1076
01:10:16,819 --> 01:10:18,403
Goodness.

1077
01:10:19,238 --> 01:10:24,076
He wasn't half-crazy.
He is completely crazy.

<i>I have been longing for you for 25 years.</i>

1080
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:35,314
-Be quiet!
-You will be beheaded for cutting me off.

1081
01:11:35,397 --> 01:11:36,648
I can't stand you!

1082
01:11:36,732 --> 01:11:37,566
<i>What is this logo?</i>

1083
01:11:37,649 --> 01:11:38,525
<i>I left the palace for too long.</i>

1084
01:11:38,609 --> 01:11:40,027
<i>Where are you?</i>

1085
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:41,361
<i>I can stop time.</i>

1086
01:11:41,570 --> 01:11:44,072
<i>I think it's a side effect
from crossing the gate.</i>
