EPISODE 16

5
00:00:27,837 --> 00:00:30,756
When is she getting home? Goodness.

6
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:36,554
<i>Dad, I'm on a stakeout tonight.
I have to go pretty far.</i>

7
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:37,638
Gosh.

8
00:00:51,736 --> 00:00:54,322
<i>Catch that jerk no matter what.
And make sure you don't skip a meal.</i>

9
00:00:54,906 --> 00:00:56,157
<i>I'm doing fine, so don't worry.</i>

10
00:01:01,454 --> 00:01:03,372
<i>Talk soon, Dad.</i>

11
00:03:01,574 --> 00:03:02,616
Walk.

KINGDOM OF COREA, 1994
THE NIGHT OF THE TREASON

13
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,036
Tell me what needs to be done.
I'll lead the way.

14
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:49,705
The traitors will arrive here
in about 20 minutes.

15
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:53,542
Yeong, I want you to stay here
and stop them from getting away.

16
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:56,045
Shoot them all down
as soon as you spot them.

17
00:03:56,128 --> 00:03:58,631
Then will you be going to
Cheonjongo alone?

18
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,343
If I fail my mission at Cheonjongo,

19
00:04:03,386 --> 00:04:06,097
you must kill Lee Lim at all costs.

20
00:04:07,098 --> 00:04:09,141
Your Majesty, what on earth
are you planning to do?

21
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,604
Don't tell me...

22
00:04:16,607 --> 00:04:17,775
No. No way.

23
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:21,529
This is my last order.

24
00:04:27,618 --> 00:04:28,828
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

25
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:32,289
I must go to Cheonjongo.

26
00:04:33,082 --> 00:04:34,125
I...

27
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:37,169
must protect my king.

28
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:39,463
That is my duty.

29
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:42,842
You cannot.

30
00:04:44,176 --> 00:04:45,177
Yeong.

31
00:04:46,512 --> 00:04:47,721
This is our last chance.

32
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,891
The same goes for me.

33
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,020
This is my last chance

34
00:04:56,856 --> 00:04:58,399
to protect Your Majesty.

35
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:05,322
<i>I hoped everything would unfold
exactly the same as it did that night.</i>

36
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:10,202
Take care, Your Majesty.

37
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:30,723
<i>At what point did things start to change?</i>

<i>Beautiful equations are always simple.</i>

40
00:05:49,825 --> 00:05:52,870
Not everyone in the world can be brave.

41
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:54,955
So I decided to be brave.

42
00:05:56,248 --> 00:05:57,374
-Captain!
-Captain!

43
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,544
No, I'll go.
Do I just have to go with this jerk?

44
00:06:06,717 --> 00:06:08,761
<i>Tonight,</i>

45
00:06:10,012 --> 00:06:11,180
<i>I'm not alone.</i>

00:06:11,263 --> 00:06:13,307
FOUR TIGER SWORD

47
00:06:14,892 --> 00:06:16,060
<i>We just haven't</i>

48
00:06:17,603 --> 00:06:19,104
<i>reached our destination yet.</i>

49
00:06:31,575 --> 00:06:32,409
So?

50
00:06:33,035 --> 00:06:34,495
What's your plan?

51
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:36,288
I will wait.

52
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:39,917
Until Gon stops you in the past

53
00:06:40,793 --> 00:06:42,461
and puts everything back in its place.

54
00:06:43,754 --> 00:06:45,589
If he fails,

55
00:06:47,383 --> 00:06:48,551
I will stop you.

56
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:53,097
But if my nephew restores order,

57
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:56,850
your memories of him will be gone.

58
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:00,813
That's why

59
00:07:02,648 --> 00:07:03,691
I'm heartbroken.

60
00:07:05,943 --> 00:07:07,861
All those radiant memories

61
00:07:10,114 --> 00:07:11,490
are engraved deep in my heart.

62
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,921
You can't shoot here.

63
00:07:27,131 --> 00:07:29,466
-Here, everything is at a standstill.
-How would you know

64
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,345
if no one's ever tried to fire a gun
here before?

65
00:08:06,295 --> 00:08:08,422
Do you really think
you can hurt me with that?

66
00:08:14,845 --> 00:08:16,263
I will try!

67
00:08:23,312 --> 00:08:24,438
I am awaiting your order.

68
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:31,070
Kill him.

69
00:09:38,721 --> 00:09:42,266
<i>There's an emergency in Cheonjongo.
Calling all Royal Guards.</i>

70
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:44,184
<i>Royal Guards assemble immediately.</i>

71
00:10:53,378 --> 00:10:54,922
Why did the Manpasikjeok...

72
00:10:58,592 --> 00:10:59,802
I must have obtained

73
00:11:00,844 --> 00:11:01,887
the whole Manpasikjeok.

74
00:11:05,891 --> 00:11:07,351
Finally, I got my hands

75
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:12,189
on the whole Manpasikjeok.

76
00:11:49,852 --> 00:11:51,353
<i>If mine is gone,</i>

77
00:11:53,272 --> 00:11:55,899
the other half that my nephew had
is probably gone too.

78
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:58,026
What now?

79
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:02,072
This means that Gon can never come back.

80
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:07,244
And you're stuck here with me
for an eternity.

81
00:12:56,793 --> 00:12:59,004
Your Majesty!

82
00:12:59,463 --> 00:13:00,589
-Your Majesty.
-Your Highness.

83
00:13:00,797 --> 00:13:04,426
-Your Majesty!
-Your Highness!

84
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:06,386

00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,554

86
00:13:07,638 --> 00:13:09,598
-Your Highness, where are you?
-Are you okay?

87
00:13:09,932 --> 00:13:11,391
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

88
00:13:11,475 --> 00:13:13,727
-Your Highness!
-Where are you?

89
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,354
-Your Majesty!
-Your Highness!

90
00:13:15,812 --> 00:13:17,064
Your Highness!

91
00:13:24,154 --> 00:13:25,656
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty.

92
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:27,491
-Your Highness!
-Your Majesty...

93
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,743
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

94
00:13:30,285 --> 00:13:32,329
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

95
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:33,705
-Your Majesty.
-Are you all right?

96
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:38,502
Take His Majesty and His Highness
to the hospital at once!

97
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:39,753
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness.

98
00:13:53,183 --> 00:13:56,895
From now on,
you are the Unbreakable Sword.

99
00:14:43,859 --> 00:14:44,901
<i>Mom.</i>

100
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:48,196
<i>Listen carefully
to what I'm about to tell you.</i>

101
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:53,118
<i>It's a very long story.</i>

102
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:54,953
Gosh, my dear son...

103
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:56,955
<i>There's something</i>

104
00:14:57,914 --> 00:14:59,958
-<i>dad's been hiding from you.</i>
-Look how you've grown.

105
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:01,043
<i>To be exact,</i>

106
00:15:03,045 --> 00:15:04,880
<i>it's about your son, Kang Sin-jae.</i>

107
00:15:04,963 --> 00:15:06,298
My baby...

108
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:13,847
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

109
00:15:15,807 --> 00:15:16,808
Sin-jae.

110
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:20,395
I had no idea.

111
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:23,690
You.

112
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,859
When did you find out?

113
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,653
That Sin-jae...
The fact that my son is in this mess.

114
00:15:29,654 --> 00:15:31,448
How long have you been
hiding this from me?

115
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:34,409
What will you do about this?

116
00:15:35,118 --> 00:15:36,953
Bring my son back!

117
00:15:37,746 --> 00:15:42,709
What will you do?
What are you going to do about this?

118
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,545
Gosh, I can't believe this.

119
00:15:47,464 --> 00:15:50,592
My poor baby...

120
00:16:11,488 --> 00:16:12,531
Sin-jae!

121
00:16:17,035 --> 00:16:18,036
Sin-jae!

122
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:21,373
Mom.

123
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:32,050
I'm sorry.

124
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:34,678
I should have given you a hug.

125
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,932
You're also my son.

126
00:16:40,225 --> 00:16:41,768
I know it's not your fault.

127
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:44,938
I should have given you a hug first.

128
00:16:46,022 --> 00:16:47,149
I'm...

129
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:49,359
I'm really sorry.

130
00:16:50,026 --> 00:16:51,153
Sorry.

131
00:17:00,245 --> 00:17:01,371
Mom.

132
00:17:52,923 --> 00:17:54,257
I was right.

133
00:17:55,634 --> 00:17:56,927
I was right after all.

134
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,891
This must be the door to another world.

Who the hell are you?

137
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:41,096
Why are you after me?

138
00:18:42,847 --> 00:18:45,558
And why do you have the Four Tiger Sword?

139
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:49,771
I am the King of the Kingdom of Corea,

140
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:52,983
the rightful owner
of the Four Tiger Sword,

141
00:18:54,943 --> 00:18:57,529
and the one who will carry out
your capital punishment.

142
00:18:57,946 --> 00:18:58,863
The King?

143
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:01,950
The King just died at my hands.

144
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:05,287
So how could you be the King?

145
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:09,499
I suppose my dear nephew has failed

146
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:13,086
seeing how I'm still alive and well.

147
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:19,259
No, you're not.

148
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:23,930
If Gon has failed, you won't be for long.

149
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:37,569
I must say, it is quite entertaining
to watch how foolishly hopeful you are.

150
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:43,033
But I will no longer tolerate
your insolence.

But it sprouted instead.

168
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:37,415
The door will close,
and only the memories will remain.

169
00:22:38,374 --> 00:22:40,335
-What's with you, seriously?
-Right?

170
00:22:40,418 --> 00:22:42,712
-I'd be happy if I didn't fail.

Hey.

172
00:22:45,548 --> 00:22:46,466
I'm sorry.

173
00:22:55,266 --> 00:22:56,309
Should I break it?

174
00:22:57,727 --> 00:22:59,062
Or just let it be?

175
00:24:01,165 --> 00:24:02,458
You did it.

176
00:24:06,671 --> 00:24:07,797
Then I guess

177
00:24:10,508 --> 00:24:11,759
you won't be able to come back.

00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,380
REPUBLIC OF KOREA, 1994

184
00:26:12,588 --> 00:26:14,841
I guess there is a god.

185
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:18,177
My husband just died.

186
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:24,267
I prayed every day that he'd die.

187
00:26:26,269 --> 00:26:27,729
I thought I would

188
00:26:29,397 --> 00:26:32,316
end up either dying or killing him

189
00:26:34,318 --> 00:26:35,987
before leaving this house.

190
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,414
But...

191
00:26:47,832 --> 00:26:49,834
someone else killed him

192
00:26:51,836 --> 00:26:53,045
for me.

193
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:04,098
Ji-hun and I...

194
00:27:07,518 --> 00:27:09,562
have nowhere to go, Seong-jae.

195
00:27:12,482 --> 00:27:13,316
So...

196
00:27:19,447 --> 00:27:21,073
you'll have to go.

197
00:27:26,537 --> 00:27:27,663
Don't worry.

198
00:27:28,956 --> 00:27:30,708
I won't do what Ji-hun's dad did.

199
00:27:43,638 --> 00:27:46,182
I can't look after you at home
because I have to work.

200
00:27:48,726 --> 00:27:50,645
Ji-hun and I will visit you
at least once a month.

201
00:27:55,066 --> 00:27:58,444
<i>I love you, Uncle. From Ji-hun.</i>

202
00:28:02,657 --> 00:28:03,866
Let's just die together.

203
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,118
-Let's die together.
-No!

204
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:07,745
-Hyeon-min!
-Mom!

205
00:28:08,329 --> 00:28:10,414
-Let's die together.
-Don't do this.

206
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:12,375
-Mom, no!
-Hyeon-min!

207
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,544
-Mom! Stop!
-I'm really sorry!

208
00:28:15,378 --> 00:28:17,964
It will only take a second. Hyeon-min!

209
00:28:18,047 --> 00:28:20,049
-I'm so sorry!
-Stop...

210
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:22,009
-I'm sorry.
-Stop!

211
00:28:22,093 --> 00:28:24,262
Don't mind us and just be on your way!

212
00:28:24,345 --> 00:28:25,888
-Mom, no...
-What on earth are you doing?

213
00:28:26,264 --> 00:28:27,348
-Mom!
-Come here.

214
00:28:28,641 --> 00:28:29,809
All of you.

215
00:28:30,101 --> 00:28:33,646
Back off.
You scared this lady and her son.

216
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:35,273
Mom.

217
00:28:42,405 --> 00:28:45,449
Kiddo, here's your shoe.

218
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,743
Here. Oh, hold on.

219
00:28:50,413 --> 00:28:51,664
There.

220
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,960
Prince Buyeong?

221
00:28:59,672 --> 00:29:01,883
Yes, that's me.

222
00:29:02,717 --> 00:29:04,051
What is your name?

223
00:29:09,098 --> 00:29:10,850
I'm Kang Hyeon-min.

224
00:29:11,434 --> 00:29:15,313
I assume it's "Hyeon" as in "to shine,"
and "Min" as in "jade."

225
00:29:16,314 --> 00:29:19,400
Your name means that you're someone
who "shines like a jewel."

226
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:28,534
Why would a member of the royal family
bother to talk to people like us?

227
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:31,579
I'm talking to you as a parent,

228
00:29:32,747 --> 00:29:34,707
not as a member of the royal family.

229
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:37,585
Your choices determine your destiny,

230
00:29:37,668 --> 00:29:42,548
but no one gets to choose their parents.

231
00:29:43,591 --> 00:29:45,843
So change this choice of yours

232
00:29:46,636 --> 00:29:51,474
for the choice you make will determine
this boy's fate.

233
00:29:57,229 --> 00:30:00,566
How about we go have a cup of tea?

234
00:30:01,442 --> 00:30:03,569
That's what I'd prescribe to you
as a doctor.

235
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:16,874
KINGDOM OF COREA, 1999

236
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:18,167
-Is this it?
-Yes.

237
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,753
-Have a nice day.
-You too. Take care.

238
00:30:30,304 --> 00:30:31,389
KOO SEO-RYEONG

239
00:30:35,142 --> 00:30:36,227
Look at that.

240
00:30:36,811 --> 00:30:39,063
How dare you glare at me? You thief.

241
00:30:46,696 --> 00:30:49,115
How old are you? And what's your name?

242
00:30:49,699 --> 00:30:51,075
This kid doesn't have a name.

243
00:30:51,575 --> 00:30:54,286
I'm sure she's stolen
from every vendor at this market.

244
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:57,373
I do have a name. I'm Luna.

245
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,293
That's such a pretty name.

246
00:31:02,712 --> 00:31:06,007
My daughter is very strong, isn't she?

247
00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:08,759
I want to apologize to you on her behalf.

248
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:10,302
Do you want to come in for food?

249
00:31:10,386 --> 00:31:12,388
What are you talking about?
You need to call the police.

250
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:14,515
What are you? A charity worker?

251
00:31:17,226 --> 00:31:19,562
It's all right. Here, come on.

252
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:30,031
Have some food first,

253
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,949
and you can take this.

254
00:31:32,825 --> 00:31:34,035
You can't take the whole thing.

255
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:36,203
I didn't sell much today.

256
00:31:49,258 --> 00:31:51,677
Why would you give me this?
Is it too little?

257
00:31:54,055 --> 00:31:55,347
I'm paying for the food.

258
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,060
Really?

259
00:31:59,727 --> 00:32:01,937
You're paying too much.

260
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:06,067
You'll have to eat a lot, okay?

261
00:32:29,131 --> 00:32:31,425
Are you all right? Do you need some help?

262
00:32:31,801 --> 00:32:33,260
-Isn't that a gun?
-That's blood!

263
00:32:33,344 --> 00:32:35,054
What is going on? She's bleeding!

264
00:32:40,684 --> 00:32:43,437
My goodness. What do we do?

265
00:32:43,521 --> 00:32:46,565
-We should go.
-Where am I?

266
00:32:47,858 --> 00:32:49,652
Is this the Republic of Korea?

267
00:32:51,153 --> 00:32:53,531
What's the date today?

268
00:32:54,115 --> 00:32:55,533
Yes, this is the Republic of Korea.

269
00:32:55,825 --> 00:32:58,327
And today is April 25, 2020.

270
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,417
I'm a police officer.
Can I use your phone to make a quick call?

271
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:16,554
Chief Park?

272
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:18,639
Chief Park.

273
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,391
It's me, Tae-eul.

274
00:33:21,142 --> 00:33:24,603
Where's Jangmi?
What about Detective Shim and Sin-jae?

275
00:33:43,164 --> 00:33:47,251
<i>For me, only about a week had passed.</i>

276
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:52,756
KIND CIVIL POLICE
ALWAYS BY THE CITIZENS' SIDE

277
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,884
-There she is.
-Here she comes.

278
00:33:55,426 --> 00:33:58,762
-Why did you kill your fellow actress?
-Was it because of the role?

279
00:33:58,846 --> 00:34:00,264
-Any comments?
-How do you feel?

280
00:34:00,347 --> 00:34:01,849
-Anything you'd like to say?
-Tell us!

281
00:34:01,932 --> 00:34:03,517
-What was your motive?
-Do you admit to the crime?

282
00:34:03,601 --> 00:34:06,520
<i>The world seemed unchanged,
yet some things</i>

283
00:34:06,604 --> 00:34:08,647
<i>had unfolded differently.</i>

284
00:34:08,731 --> 00:34:09,732
What did you say?

285
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:11,567
<i>I was still a lieutenant.</i>

286
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,985
Are you running a charity?

287
00:34:13,068 --> 00:34:15,654
<i>And I still tried to do something nice
for my dad once a month.</i>

288
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:27,833
<i>And I lived everyday</i>

289
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:31,462
<i>with my memories of him still intact,</i>

290
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:37,343
<i>in a world where he or Sin-jae</i>

291
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:40,846
<i>no longer exists.</i>

292
00:34:51,016 --> 00:34:52,017
It's not you, right?

293
00:34:53,226 --> 00:34:55,145
-Pardon?
-You're not the one

294
00:34:55,228 --> 00:34:56,730
who keeps calling my hubby out.

295
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,026
It is me.

296
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:02,610
I did that.

297
00:35:03,945 --> 00:35:05,655
-Get going.
-Okay.

298
00:35:16,249 --> 00:35:18,710
CIRCLE MART, ILSAN CITY BRANCH
BACKPACK, SNEAKERS 110,000 WON

299
00:35:18,793 --> 00:35:22,213
The person who keeps calling my hubby over
must be starting school next year.

300
00:35:31,097 --> 00:35:32,891
Bo-gyeong!

301
00:35:44,486 --> 00:35:45,361
You...

302
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,241
Hee-ju.

303
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:54,454
When snow piles up,
it can make some roofs collapse.

304
00:35:55,789 --> 00:35:57,665
The weight of snow

305
00:35:57,749 --> 00:36:00,960
can be unbearable to some 16-year-old kid.

306
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,089
Is that your solitude?

307
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:05,715
Yes.

308
00:36:06,508 --> 00:36:07,509
You could say that.

309
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:11,012
Do you remember Seong-min's friend?

310
00:36:11,096 --> 00:36:13,890
-Yes.
-That's his grandmother and sister.

311
00:36:14,474 --> 00:36:17,852
As you can probably guess,
his grandmother is very ill.

312
00:36:18,853 --> 00:36:21,106
He couldn't pay the hospital bills,

313
00:36:22,732 --> 00:36:25,235
so he stole money from the safe
at his job.

314
00:36:25,985 --> 00:36:27,695
-And?
-And

315
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:31,699
he asked me for a favor
before he got arrested.

316
00:36:32,867 --> 00:36:36,913
He asked me to buy his sister
a bag of steamed buns.

317
00:36:37,163 --> 00:36:38,331
And he also asked me

318
00:36:39,374 --> 00:36:42,627
to remove snow from their roof.

319
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,634
That's why I started visiting her,
and here I am.

320
00:36:51,261 --> 00:36:53,555
She needs hope
to get through it all, you know?

321
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,935
But I had no idea I'd see you here.

322
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:02,647
My goodness, seriously.

323
00:37:03,648 --> 00:37:06,442
Come on. I thought you were
here to plow snow.

324
00:37:07,569 --> 00:37:09,863
Honey, shall we hold hands?

325
00:37:10,363 --> 00:37:13,074
Well, how about I build a snowman for you?

326
00:37:51,654 --> 00:37:54,449
LEE JI-HUN

327
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,222
<i>If that door closes,</i>

328
00:38:19,098 --> 00:38:20,808
I'll open every single door
in the universe.

329
00:38:21,392 --> 00:38:22,268
And

330
00:38:24,354 --> 00:38:25,647
I'll come to you.

331
00:38:40,912 --> 00:38:42,038
You promised you'd come.

332
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,806
Who might you be?

333
00:39:41,889 --> 00:39:43,224
Can I help you?

334
00:39:44,392 --> 00:39:45,935
I'm looking for someone,

335
00:39:47,937 --> 00:39:49,647
but it doesn't look like
she's in this world.

336
00:39:51,899 --> 00:39:52,900
All right, then.

337
00:40:10,168 --> 00:40:11,169
Can I help you?

338
00:40:16,966 --> 00:40:17,842
Even here,

339
00:40:19,844 --> 00:40:21,679
you're busy protecting someone.

340
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,807
JEONG EUN-KYEONG
REPUBLIC OF KOREA ARMY

341
00:40:27,977 --> 00:40:30,646
-Tae-ra, we're here.
-Okay.

342
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:33,191
Tae-ra, be careful
not to step on the dress.

343
00:40:33,441 --> 00:40:34,942
Hold on. Here.

344
00:40:35,818 --> 00:40:36,652
Hyeong-taek.

345
00:40:37,403 --> 00:40:39,238
Where's my trophy?

346
00:40:39,614 --> 00:40:41,074
My trophy for the Grand Prize.

347
00:40:41,157 --> 00:40:42,367
It's in the boss' car.

348
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:43,993
-I'll bring it tomorrow.
-Grand Prize,

349
00:40:44,827 --> 00:40:46,913
Jeong Tae-ra!

350
00:40:50,708 --> 00:40:54,545
Once again, I'd like to sincerely thank
Hyeong-taek, Yeong-han, Eun-gi

351
00:40:54,629 --> 00:40:57,924
and Hye-yeon. I owe it all to you guys.

352
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:04,847
Hey, who's that handsome man?

353
00:41:07,016 --> 00:41:08,768
Are you a member of Tae-ra Byte?

354
00:41:10,186 --> 00:41:12,313
Sorry, no photos.
I'll take those flowers though.

355
00:41:12,814 --> 00:41:14,107
It seems like

356
00:41:15,191 --> 00:41:16,651
you already received flowers.

357
00:41:18,653 --> 00:41:19,612
These flowers

358
00:41:20,113 --> 00:41:21,697
are not for you.

359
00:41:23,366 --> 00:41:25,159
I can't believe what I just heard.

360
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:28,162
Why aren't they for me?

361
00:41:30,289 --> 00:41:32,250
I'm Jeong Tae-ra,
the winner of the Grand Prize.

362
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:34,961
I won the Grand Prize today.

363
00:41:53,062 --> 00:41:54,272
Who are you?

364
00:41:56,315 --> 00:41:57,608
Hyo-jin!

365
00:41:58,651 --> 00:42:01,237
Mom, why did you buy so much stuff?
It must be heavy.

366
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,030
-I should have gone with you.
-It's okay.

367
00:42:03,448 --> 00:42:05,491
Oh, who's this young man?

368
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:10,204
Are you here to see Hyo-jin?

369
00:42:10,288 --> 00:42:12,081
Mom, no.

370
00:42:13,916 --> 00:42:16,669
I'm sorry, but who are you looking for?

371
00:42:19,464 --> 00:42:20,465
In this world,

372
00:42:21,549 --> 00:42:22,967
you're with your mother.

373
00:42:25,303 --> 00:42:26,387
I'm glad.

374
00:42:32,477 --> 00:42:35,438
REPUBLIC OF KOREA, 2021

375
00:42:36,939 --> 00:42:38,024
Hey, Na-ri.

376
00:42:38,107 --> 00:42:39,901
<i>Tae-eul, don't be surprised.</i>

377
00:42:40,401 --> 00:42:41,986
<i>I think your dad bought a horse.</i>

378
00:42:43,571 --> 00:42:44,697
-A horse?
-<i>Yes.</i>

379
00:42:45,031 --> 00:42:48,743
<i>There's some guy on a white horse
at the Taekwondo center now.</i>

380
00:42:49,368 --> 00:42:50,578
<i>I guess he's selling the horse.</i>

381
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:53,247
<i>This guy looks like a pro.</i>

382
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,504
Na-ri, I have to go.

383
00:43:31,285 --> 00:43:32,411
You exist

384
00:43:33,246 --> 00:43:35,164
across every universe.

385
00:43:39,043 --> 00:43:40,503
And you still don't recognize me.

386
00:43:46,842 --> 00:43:47,969
But you...

387
00:43:50,221 --> 00:43:51,222
Why are you crying?

388
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,393
You seemed happy
in every world that I saw you.

389
00:43:55,851 --> 00:43:57,520
It was the only thing that comforted me.

390
00:44:03,734 --> 00:44:04,735
But you...

391
00:44:08,656 --> 00:44:10,449
Why do you look
as though you recognize me?

392
00:44:12,702 --> 00:44:13,703
Why do you look

393
00:44:16,622 --> 00:44:18,374
as though you remember
everything about me?

394
00:44:28,926 --> 00:44:31,470
JEONG TAE-EUL
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

395
00:44:42,857 --> 00:44:43,858
Is it you?

396
00:44:48,613 --> 00:44:49,697
Jeong Tae-eul.

397
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,827
Is it really you? Yes?

398
00:44:58,706 --> 00:44:59,749
You came?

399
00:45:02,043 --> 00:45:02,918
You really

400
00:45:04,045 --> 00:45:04,879
came for me?

401
00:45:08,174 --> 00:45:09,050
You've finally

402
00:45:10,343 --> 00:45:11,469
arrived.

403
00:45:17,141 --> 00:45:18,017
Finally.

404
00:45:20,936 --> 00:45:22,563
I finally got to see you,

405
00:45:24,982 --> 00:45:26,275
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

406
00:45:37,286 --> 00:45:38,871
What took you so long?

407
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:41,666
I kept waiting for you.

408
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,168
Every single day,

409
00:45:45,878 --> 00:45:47,171
I waited for you.

410
00:45:56,889 --> 00:45:58,307
<i>After I slew the traitor,</i>

411
00:45:59,225 --> 00:46:00,976
<i>I had to go back and get Yeong.</i>

412
00:46:04,063 --> 00:46:07,525
DECEMBER 13, 1994, EMERGENCY ALARMS
WENT OFF IN CHEONJONGO AT 23:15

413
00:46:08,484 --> 00:46:13,155
KINGDOM OF COREA, 2021

414
00:46:16,659 --> 00:46:20,663
DECEMBER 14, 1994, TRAITOR LEE LIM
FOUND DEAD IN THE BAMBOO GROVE

415
00:46:35,261 --> 00:46:37,096
<i>So I had to find my way back again,</i>

416
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:41,058
<i>which meant I had to open
every single door in the universe.</i>

417
00:46:43,102 --> 00:46:44,603
That's why it took me so long.

418
00:46:45,688 --> 00:46:49,024
And I didn't think you'd remember me
even if I did find you.

419
00:46:52,945 --> 00:46:54,113
Yet you still

420
00:46:56,031 --> 00:46:57,283
kept looking for me?

421
00:46:57,366 --> 00:46:59,201
Even if you forgot all about me,

422
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:00,953
I still wanted to see you.

423
00:47:02,621 --> 00:47:04,790
I was going to tell you again
if you had forgotten me.

424
00:47:07,251 --> 00:47:09,336
That I am the King
of the Kingdom of Corea,

425
00:47:09,837 --> 00:47:12,006
and that my name, which is not
supposed to be called,

426
00:47:12,965 --> 00:47:15,009
is Lee Gon.

427
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:22,099
But how do you

428
00:47:22,975 --> 00:47:25,269
still remember me
when the two worlds flowed differently?

429
00:47:25,352 --> 00:47:26,771
Let's skip that.

430
00:47:28,063 --> 00:47:31,317
I've also been through many things myself.

431
00:47:34,737 --> 00:47:36,113
And now, this.

432
00:48:10,898 --> 00:48:11,982
Do you still

433
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,360
hate flowers?

434
00:48:19,031 --> 00:48:20,157
No, I like flowers.

435
00:48:22,368 --> 00:48:25,579
Especially this flower.

436
00:48:36,465 --> 00:48:38,342
I realized I haven't told you this.

437
00:48:42,972 --> 00:48:43,973
I love you.

438
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:47,351
I am deeply...

439
00:48:49,311 --> 00:48:51,564
in love with you.

440
00:49:00,364 --> 00:49:01,365
So this is

441
00:49:04,034 --> 00:49:05,786
how everything comes together.

442
00:49:09,748 --> 00:49:11,208
I love you too.

443
00:49:13,544 --> 00:49:14,545
I...

444
00:49:16,005 --> 00:49:17,590
love you so much too.

445
00:49:45,409 --> 00:49:50,205
KINGDOM OF COREA, 2022

446
00:49:50,998 --> 00:49:52,833
The twins are doing well?

447
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:55,419
I'm stressed from babysitting them
all by myself.

448
00:49:55,753 --> 00:49:58,047
Why did my parents
have to get back together?

449
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:00,549
What are their names again?

450
00:50:01,759 --> 00:50:03,928
They go by their nicknames.

451
00:50:05,137 --> 00:50:07,056
Eun-bi and Kka-bi.

452
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:11,268
Don't you miss him?

453
00:50:18,567 --> 00:50:19,735
I'm all right.

454
00:50:20,819 --> 00:50:24,156
Jo Eun-sup wouldn't remember me anyway.

455
00:50:29,995 --> 00:50:31,830
Here's what Your Majesty
asked me to look into.

456
00:50:40,089 --> 00:50:46,387
PERSONNEL FILE
HAEUNDAE POLICE STATION

457
00:51:05,823 --> 00:51:06,824
I'm here.

458
00:51:07,449 --> 00:51:08,325
Hey, man.

459
00:51:09,368 --> 00:51:10,953
I told you not to call me like that.

460
00:51:11,036 --> 00:51:13,330
You need to be quick
when your senior summons you.

461
00:51:15,124 --> 00:51:16,291
I'm off today.

462
00:51:17,251 --> 00:51:19,628
Gosh, I really wasn't going to say this.

463
00:51:19,712 --> 00:51:20,796
It's my birthday today.

464
00:51:21,338 --> 00:51:23,007
-I know.
-Really? How do you know?

465
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:24,091
I was forced to find out.

466
00:51:25,509 --> 00:51:26,760
I got another one of these.

467
00:51:27,344 --> 00:51:28,637
Chief told me to cuff you.

468
00:51:28,721 --> 00:51:31,056
Well, it's not like all offenders
hang out at parking lots.

469
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,350
They're out in the streets.
They can be anywhere.

470
00:51:34,351 --> 00:51:36,895
You called me over on my day off
just to give me this?

471
00:51:36,979 --> 00:51:39,231
No, I wanted to buy you a gift.

472
00:51:42,151 --> 00:51:44,820
You can't take it back.
I'll go pick something, then.

473
00:51:53,871 --> 00:51:55,914
Yes, this is Kang Hyeon-min
at Violent Crimes Squad 3.

474
00:52:06,091 --> 00:52:10,596
MAY 27, 2022

475
00:52:24,193 --> 00:52:26,320
-Have you eaten yet?
-I have, of course.

476
00:52:26,695 --> 00:52:28,864
-Did you sleep well last night?
-I sure did.

477
00:52:28,947 --> 00:52:31,825
Hey, you should be asking me
these questions.

478
00:52:31,909 --> 00:52:33,827
Don't you think you should be asking me

479
00:52:33,911 --> 00:52:35,913
if I've been eating and sleeping well?

480
00:52:36,538 --> 00:52:39,792
How I've been eating and sleeping!
And my appeal!

481
00:52:40,125 --> 00:52:41,001
Do you not care?

482
00:52:41,085 --> 00:52:43,670
Do you think cops in the Kingdom of Corea
have that much free time?

483
00:52:44,296 --> 00:52:45,923
Had you wanted to eat and sleep well,

484
00:52:46,006 --> 00:52:47,382
you, as an assemblywoman,

485
00:52:47,466 --> 00:52:50,427
shouldn't have stolen
the people's tax money like that.

486
00:52:50,511 --> 00:52:52,137
-Hey!
-What?

487
00:52:54,723 --> 00:52:56,683
It's the law that's messed up.

488
00:52:57,226 --> 00:52:59,228
Shouldn't I receive immunity
as an assemblywoman?

489
00:53:00,395 --> 00:53:03,941
Gosh, this is why
I should've become Prime Minister.

490
00:53:04,024 --> 00:53:04,858
Inmate 5827.

491
00:53:05,859 --> 00:53:07,486
Keep it down in the visitation room.

492
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:13,033
How's Mom doing?

493
00:53:13,117 --> 00:53:15,911
If you have time to visit me,
take better care of Mom.

494
00:53:15,994 --> 00:53:17,996
If you want to be a good daughter,
do it yourself.

495
00:53:18,622 --> 00:53:20,624
Take care of her yourself,
after you're released.

496
00:53:20,707 --> 00:53:22,251
As much as I want to get out...

497
00:53:23,877 --> 00:53:25,379
Get me a new lawyer at once!

498
00:53:25,462 --> 00:53:27,881
-Hire someone expensive.
-Inmate 5827, keep it down!

499
00:53:30,134 --> 00:53:31,385
Gosh.

500
00:53:33,095 --> 00:53:35,430
Can you get me a new correctional officer?

501
00:53:38,183 --> 00:53:41,645
His orders really get on my nerves.

502
00:53:43,063 --> 00:53:44,356
I'm all done.

503
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:46,400
-Be well.
-Hey!

504
00:53:46,817 --> 00:53:47,776
Koo Seo-gyeong!

505
00:53:51,572 --> 00:53:53,073
-Hey, newbie.
-Yes, ma'am.

506
00:53:53,157 --> 00:53:56,160
The NFS called. You left your phone there.

507
00:53:56,243 --> 00:53:58,203
Really? I bought that phone yesterday.

508
00:53:59,788 --> 00:54:00,747
Oh, it's here.

509
00:54:00,831 --> 00:54:03,876
Can I really entrust you
with this important task?

510
00:54:03,959 --> 00:54:04,960
Is it a case?

511
00:54:05,294 --> 00:54:07,087
It will be if you don't do this properly.

512
00:54:07,421 --> 00:54:10,591
All right.
Shred all the documents in this box.

513
00:54:10,674 --> 00:54:14,469
As for these plastic bottles,
remove the lids and labels

514
00:54:15,929 --> 00:54:17,681
-and recycle them. Go.
-Got it.

515
00:54:18,432 --> 00:54:20,934
By the way, where do you go every weekend?

516
00:54:21,727 --> 00:54:23,020
Why do you ask?

517
00:54:23,228 --> 00:54:25,480
Chief told me to look into it...

518
00:54:26,648 --> 00:54:30,444
Gosh, that old man. He's the one
being fishy with that solitude of his.

519
00:54:32,446 --> 00:54:34,198
I go on a trip every weekend. Have fun.

520
00:54:35,407 --> 00:54:36,491
See you later!

521
00:54:37,034 --> 00:54:39,244
<i>Gosh, they're very expensive.</i>

522
00:54:39,328 --> 00:54:41,079
And so many of them.

523
00:54:41,872 --> 00:54:44,249
How could you sell all of them
every single time?

524
00:54:45,584 --> 00:54:49,755
Seriously, where have you been going
every weekend?

525
00:54:50,505 --> 00:54:54,426
Every single time,
you're not back until dawn.

526
00:54:54,509 --> 00:54:58,597
No matter where that place actually is,
you must call it "the study."

527
00:54:59,348 --> 00:55:02,059
I'll try to sell less buttons this week.

528
00:55:03,769 --> 00:55:04,937
Oh, my head.

529
00:55:05,437 --> 00:55:07,272
Oh, my heart.

530
00:55:08,857 --> 00:55:10,525
If you have to sell them,

531
00:55:10,817 --> 00:55:13,195
sell the ones on your sleeves first.

532
00:55:13,737 --> 00:55:14,947
Keep your jacket buttoned up

533
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:17,658
since it's cold.

534
00:55:20,452 --> 00:55:21,954
You're getting pretty good at this.

535
00:55:24,164 --> 00:55:25,499
Put it back.

536
00:55:26,541 --> 00:55:28,210
What can I do?

537
00:55:28,919 --> 00:55:31,838
I need to do this
to be able to sleep at night.

538
00:55:32,172 --> 00:55:33,090
Put it back.

539
00:55:37,344 --> 00:55:38,387
All right, fine.

540
00:55:51,275 --> 00:55:53,193
<i>Perhaps Tae-eul's threats worked.</i>

541
00:55:54,403 --> 00:55:58,907
<i>Thanks to her, we're doing all the things
that we've skipped.</i>

542
00:56:00,867 --> 00:56:02,744
<i>We even have some know-hows now.</i>

543
00:56:03,578 --> 00:56:05,914
<i>First, we find out what year we're in</i>

544
00:56:07,165 --> 00:56:10,877
<i>to make sure
we won't run into our counterparts.</i>

545
00:56:11,712 --> 00:56:14,423
Oh, it's the rotary dial phone,
not the push-button one.

546
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,009
It means it's before 1981, so we're safe.

547
00:56:17,634 --> 00:56:18,844
Let's go.

548
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,225
That's a model from the early 90s.

549
00:56:25,934 --> 00:56:27,102
We're fairly safe.

550
00:56:32,524 --> 00:56:34,109
I'm not sure about this one.

551
00:56:34,735 --> 00:56:35,986
What year could this be?

552
00:56:37,863 --> 00:56:40,282
Oh, hold on a second.
I see some newspapers over there.

553
00:56:45,704 --> 00:56:47,080
This is still refreshing.

554
00:56:49,875 --> 00:56:50,792
Your Majesty!

555
00:56:54,463 --> 00:56:56,131
Please leave.

556
00:57:03,764 --> 00:57:05,390
That man recognized me.

557
00:57:05,474 --> 00:57:06,767
Yes, we've got to run.

558
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:10,228
You exist in this world.
Apparently, you're a tyrant here.

559
00:57:11,146 --> 00:57:12,147
What?

560
00:57:15,734 --> 00:57:17,486
This is another parallel world.

561
00:57:18,195 --> 00:57:20,530
Lee Gon here must have had
a bad upbringing.

562
00:57:21,114 --> 00:57:22,657
I guess he grew without
Head Court Lady Noh, his uncle,

563
00:57:23,075 --> 00:57:25,035
and someone's identification card.

564
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:27,496
He must've been scared and lonely
while growing up.

565
00:57:28,455 --> 00:57:30,916
Let's leave. It's dangerous to stay
where our counterparts live.

566
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,001
Okay.

567
00:57:35,379 --> 00:57:38,131
<i>And that's how we travel together,</i>

568
00:57:38,965 --> 00:57:42,469
<i>although our destinations
are a little extraordinary.</i>

569
00:57:42,969 --> 00:57:45,972
THE NEW MILLENNIUM,
A NEW BEGINNING

570
00:57:54,398 --> 00:57:56,900
"The new millennium"?
Then it must be the year 2000.

571
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:58,485
It should be pretty safe.

572
00:57:58,735 --> 00:58:01,321
Gosh, so many people thought
the world was going to end in 2000.

573
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,532
We're near Corea University now.

574
00:58:05,826 --> 00:58:06,827
Come with me.

575
00:58:07,202 --> 00:58:09,246
I know someone who wants to meet

576
00:58:09,704 --> 00:58:11,456
the woman who insists the earth is flat.

577
00:58:27,013 --> 00:58:30,475
By the way, who's the person
that wants to meet me?

578
00:58:42,237 --> 00:58:44,739
Excuse me. Are you looking for this?

579
00:58:45,824 --> 00:58:47,701
Yes, thank you.

580
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,161
Have a nice day.

581
00:58:49,244 --> 00:58:50,745
Thank you. You too.

582
00:59:05,385 --> 00:59:06,470
Is he

583
00:59:07,596 --> 00:59:09,931
the person who wanted to meet me?

584
00:59:10,015 --> 00:59:10,891
Yes.

585
00:59:12,017 --> 00:59:13,351
And he met you just now.

586
00:59:15,187 --> 00:59:16,938
He's the uncle who raised me.

587
00:59:27,282 --> 00:59:28,283
But the thing is,

588
00:59:28,617 --> 00:59:32,496
the woman who used to insist
that the earth is flat no longer exists.

589
00:59:33,038 --> 00:59:35,499
My earth has become round as well.

590
00:59:36,249 --> 00:59:37,083
Really?

591
00:59:38,001 --> 00:59:38,919
Because of me?

592
00:59:39,794 --> 00:59:42,130
As if. Because of gravity, obviously.

593
00:59:42,214 --> 00:59:44,299
And that's also the reason
apples fall to the ground.

594
00:59:46,218 --> 00:59:47,219
What else?

595
00:59:48,428 --> 00:59:50,472
It's also what creates tides.

596
00:59:51,431 --> 00:59:53,225
-What else?
-I love you.

597
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:54,976
My goodness.

598
00:59:56,478 --> 00:59:58,813
Why am I startled every time I hear this?

599
01:00:00,482 --> 01:00:01,316
Me too.

600
01:00:03,109 --> 01:00:05,320
By the way, I hope we end up
in the Joseon dynasty

601
01:00:05,403 --> 01:00:07,739
or the late Joseon period next time.

602
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:09,658
Why that specific time period?

603
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:13,870
I took a quick look around,
and we've finally come to Joseon.

604
01:00:13,954 --> 01:00:15,038
Where's my <i>hanbok</i>?

605
01:00:15,121 --> 01:00:17,290
Why did you want to travel
to the Joseon dynasty so much?

606
01:00:18,959 --> 01:00:21,002
I must find my great-grandfather
and tell him

607
01:00:21,086 --> 01:00:23,588
to buy the pear field in Apgujeong-dong
when he's older.

608
01:00:24,714 --> 01:00:26,591
Where's the traditional hairpin?

609
01:00:33,557 --> 01:00:34,683
What is this?

610
01:00:35,433 --> 01:00:37,561
Why did you bring these leaves?

611
01:00:38,228 --> 01:00:40,021
Because we never know where we'll end up.

612
01:00:40,438 --> 01:00:43,358
Based on our experiences so far,
there's no guarantee

613
01:00:43,441 --> 01:00:45,318
we won't end up in that time period.

614
01:00:49,114 --> 01:00:51,324
Yes. I mean, the chances are slim,
but we should be--

615
01:00:55,203 --> 01:00:56,538
We should be prepared.

616
01:00:59,291 --> 01:01:01,084
-It's very important.
-Look for my hairpin.

617
01:01:02,586 --> 01:01:04,337
Why would you put that back?

618
01:01:05,171 --> 01:01:10,468
BUS STOP
PYEONGCHANG MUNHWA INTERSECTION

619
01:01:24,858 --> 01:01:25,817
Darn it.

620
01:01:27,277 --> 01:01:28,278
I got your ball.

621
01:01:28,862 --> 01:01:29,779
Stay there.

622
01:01:32,073 --> 01:01:33,241
I'll throw it over.

623
01:01:36,828 --> 01:01:37,787
Thank you.

624
01:01:39,205 --> 01:01:40,206
KANG SIN-JAE

625
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:42,792
PYEONGCHANG-DONG
REPUBLIC OF KOREA, 1994

626
01:01:42,876 --> 01:01:43,710
Oh, wait.

627
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:48,256
Where are you headed?
I'll tell you the bus routes.

628
01:01:53,178 --> 01:01:54,179
There's been an accident.

629
01:01:54,763 --> 01:01:57,390
Bye. I've got to run home
and report the accident.

630
01:02:04,898 --> 01:02:06,441
-Hey.
-I got us some bus tokens.

631
01:02:08,985 --> 01:02:10,612
What is it? Did something happen?

632
01:02:11,237 --> 01:02:13,657
I think I know why the door brought us

633
01:02:15,325 --> 01:02:16,660
to this time on this day.

634
01:02:29,673 --> 01:02:33,968
REPUBLIC OF KOREA, 2022

635
01:02:37,597 --> 01:02:38,890
Hold on a second.

636
01:02:39,432 --> 01:02:40,600
-Here.
-I'm curious.

637
01:02:41,434 --> 01:02:43,561
-This is Eun-bi, and this is Kka-bi.
-I see.

638
01:02:43,645 --> 01:02:45,730
-They're already in elementary school.
-Really?

639
01:02:45,814 --> 01:02:47,649
-They're adorable.
-They look like you.

640
01:02:47,732 --> 01:02:49,442
-You think they look alike?
-Do they?

641
01:02:49,526 --> 01:02:51,361
These were the good days.
Do we look alike?

642
01:02:51,444 --> 01:02:52,445
-Well...
-Not really.

643
01:03:01,579 --> 01:03:03,248
Why is that guy staring at me?

644
01:03:05,041 --> 01:03:06,334
Hold on.

645
01:03:16,761 --> 01:03:19,597
Excuse me. Do I know you?

646
01:03:21,474 --> 01:03:22,767
How are things with you?

647
01:03:24,853 --> 01:03:28,231
Oh, do you work here too?
Which department?

648
01:03:29,274 --> 01:03:31,776
Did you get a driver's license?

649
01:03:32,652 --> 01:03:34,028
Yes, Class 1-special.

650
01:03:35,655 --> 01:03:37,449
Wait, why do I keep answering
your questions?

651
01:03:38,199 --> 01:03:39,534
Who are you?

652
01:03:41,953 --> 01:03:43,621
JO EUN-SUP

653
01:03:43,705 --> 01:03:44,622
You're looking good.

654
01:03:45,165 --> 01:03:46,374
Confident and strong.

655
01:03:47,625 --> 01:03:49,169
It was nice meeting you.

656
01:03:50,795 --> 01:03:52,547
To me, you'll always be
the Unbreakable Sword.

657
01:03:53,131 --> 01:03:54,132
What?

658
01:03:56,551 --> 01:03:58,094
"The Unbreakable Sword"?

659
01:04:01,097 --> 01:04:02,640
NA-RI NA-RI MYEONG NA-RI

660
01:04:05,018 --> 01:04:06,269
Hi, honey.

661
01:04:06,895 --> 01:04:09,731
What? Yes, I had lunch. What about you?

662
01:04:10,732 --> 01:04:12,901
Oh, you're on a diet?

663
01:04:12,984 --> 01:04:15,361
Come on. You don't need to lose weight.

664
01:04:16,696 --> 01:04:18,573
Oh, you do?

665
01:04:20,325 --> 01:04:21,910
Then you should've told me.

666
01:04:21,993 --> 01:04:25,455
Every time I see you, I can't believe
you're real because you're so perfect.

667
01:04:26,915 --> 01:04:29,209
Okay, I'll be home soon. Bye.

668
01:04:30,668 --> 01:04:31,669
What a lunatic.

669
01:04:42,847 --> 01:04:43,848
Wait.

670
01:04:44,891 --> 01:04:46,935
What? Where are we now?

671
01:04:47,018 --> 01:04:49,145
Those are 1,200-lumen flashlights.

672
01:04:49,229 --> 01:04:50,688
The Royal Guards use them.

673
01:04:53,274 --> 01:04:55,401
We came to the same period
in the Kingdom of Corea.

674
01:04:56,402 --> 01:04:58,196
Damn it. I left just a little while ago.

675
01:04:58,279 --> 01:04:59,864
Yeong must be looking for me.

676
01:05:00,073 --> 01:05:00,990
What?

677
01:05:09,332 --> 01:05:10,166
Your Majesty?

678
01:05:13,378 --> 01:05:15,672
The Royal Guards are
to take ten steps back at once.

679
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,216
Yeong, you too.

680
01:05:18,299 --> 01:05:19,759
You guys totally startled me.

681
01:05:22,595 --> 01:05:24,305
I'll take a roundabout way to the palace.

682
01:05:24,389 --> 01:05:27,350
I'll go through the beach
so that no one will see me.

683
01:05:35,108 --> 01:05:36,442
-Your Majesty.
-Yes, Yeong.

684
01:05:37,777 --> 01:05:38,778
It's that situation.

685
01:05:50,915 --> 01:05:52,208
Gosh, I almost couldn't breathe.

686
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:56,462
Who's after Yeong?

687
01:05:57,005 --> 01:05:58,590
Who finds out next?

688
01:06:00,216 --> 01:06:01,467
-Head Court Lady Noh?
-Head Court Lady Noh.

689
01:06:03,094 --> 01:06:03,928
Your Majesty.

690
01:06:13,897 --> 01:06:15,648
The talisman must've worked.

691
01:06:16,441 --> 01:06:18,610
I'm letting her use my personal item.

692
01:06:18,943 --> 01:06:20,236
You should know what that means.

693
01:06:24,324 --> 01:06:25,867
I've been wondering

694
01:06:26,367 --> 01:06:28,786
when the Royal Ancestral Shrine
will be completed.

695
01:06:29,829 --> 01:06:32,040
Will it be completed next year?

696
01:06:36,628 --> 01:06:39,255
Drink up. All of it.

697
01:06:40,131 --> 01:06:40,965
Will do.

698
01:06:56,522 --> 01:06:58,524
You're the only one who uses this?

699
01:06:59,317 --> 01:07:02,362
Of course. But you can use it anytime.

700
01:07:03,279 --> 01:07:04,280
What are you doing?

701
01:07:05,281 --> 01:07:07,116
I shouldn't leave my fingerprints on this.

702
01:07:07,825 --> 01:07:09,577
Luna lives in this world, you know.

703
01:07:10,703 --> 01:07:13,498
This is very popular in my world.

704
01:07:16,668 --> 01:07:19,212
What about the security footage?

705
01:07:19,545 --> 01:07:20,838
I must've been caught on the cameras.

706
01:07:22,006 --> 01:07:23,549
I'll clear the control tower.

707
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:32,475
My gosh, talk about tight security.

708
01:07:34,852 --> 01:07:36,062
How do I shut this off?

709
01:07:39,065 --> 01:07:41,234
Look. Isn't that Jo Yeong?

710
01:07:45,905 --> 01:07:47,782
Jeez, him and his temper.

711
01:07:49,158 --> 01:07:50,410
What's he saying?

712
01:07:53,121 --> 01:07:57,542
Oh, you're a detective,
so you can probably read lips.

713
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:00,211
Of course.

714
01:08:00,503 --> 01:08:01,587
Let me see.

715
01:08:06,968 --> 01:08:07,969
Lee.

716
01:08:09,012 --> 01:08:10,263
Gon...

717
01:08:11,097 --> 01:08:12,306
Son of...

718
01:08:14,726 --> 01:08:16,644
We showed up out of the blue.

719
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:18,021
You know?

720
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:20,690
I'll be upset If Chief Park gives me work

721
01:08:20,773 --> 01:08:22,025
just when I'm about to take off.

722
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:23,860
So what did he say?

723
01:08:24,610 --> 01:08:26,863
Did he call me a dog? Bow wow?

724
01:08:28,448 --> 01:08:30,825
Yeong? The man I've trusted
since I was four?

725
01:08:31,868 --> 01:08:33,911
Most Royal Guards are science and
engineering majors.

726
01:08:33,995 --> 01:08:35,872
I can't believe they lost.

727
01:08:37,582 --> 01:08:39,083
Yeong would never do that.

728
01:08:39,625 --> 01:08:41,419
He doesn't keep any secrets from me.

729
01:08:41,502 --> 01:08:42,336
My gosh.

730
01:08:44,172 --> 01:08:45,339
What's going on over there?

731
01:08:46,174 --> 01:08:47,633
Looks like he has a secret after all.

732
01:08:48,217 --> 01:08:49,719
What genre would this be?

733
01:08:49,969 --> 01:08:51,721
A romantic comedy? A spy film?

734
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:55,725
Oh, no. Here comes the disrupter.

735
01:08:57,435 --> 01:08:58,561
I like this movie.

736
01:08:58,936 --> 01:09:00,313
It's already a big hit.

737
01:09:00,772 --> 01:09:03,566
I'm on my toes right now.
This is a thriller.

738
01:09:04,525 --> 01:09:05,777
No, this is a melodrama.

739
01:09:26,839 --> 01:09:29,801
<i>Just like that,
we even watched our own movie.</i>

740
01:09:42,396 --> 01:09:43,856
I don't want to leave.

741
01:09:47,151 --> 01:09:47,985
I'm off.

742
01:09:50,154 --> 01:09:50,988
That's it?

743
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:54,992
I'm late. I have to sprint.

744
01:09:55,868 --> 01:09:57,245
-See you on the weekend.
-Wait.

745
01:10:01,916 --> 01:10:04,794
Why the weekend?
The holidays begin on Wednesday.

746
01:10:04,877 --> 01:10:06,420
Really? That's not the case in my world.

747
01:10:06,504 --> 01:10:07,421
What kind of holiday?

748
01:10:09,257 --> 01:10:10,800
The King's Birthday.

749
01:10:12,218 --> 01:10:13,261
Bye.

750
01:10:14,887 --> 01:10:16,097
Be well.

751
01:10:16,764 --> 01:10:18,641
You too. See you, Lee Gon.

752
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,394
See you, Jeong Tae-eul.

753
01:10:22,311 --> 01:10:23,896
<i>We return to our daily lives</i>

754
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,440
<i>after we walk each other to the obelisk</i>

755
01:10:26,816 --> 01:10:28,359
<i>instead of our homes.</i>

756
01:10:30,486 --> 01:10:31,737
Stop right there, punk!

757
01:10:34,073 --> 01:10:36,117
God damn it!

758
01:10:48,546 --> 01:10:49,589
Shit.

759
01:10:50,798 --> 01:10:55,803
You see, I have a lot of respect for those
who try to change the future,

760
01:10:55,970 --> 01:10:58,764
but it'd be better for you
to just get caught now.

761
01:10:58,848 --> 01:11:01,142
If you want to be able to walk
to the police station, that is.

762
01:11:01,225 --> 01:11:02,476
In your dreams.

763
01:11:02,643 --> 01:11:04,979
Climb over the wall,
starting with the one at the very back!

764
01:11:05,062 --> 01:11:06,480
-Go.
-Hey, move it.

765
01:11:06,606 --> 01:11:08,232
What? Who's that prick?

766
01:11:08,316 --> 01:11:10,484
-Who is he?
-Hi.

767
01:11:11,777 --> 01:11:13,571
I'm Jang Michael
from Violent Crimes Unit 3

768
01:11:13,654 --> 01:11:14,822
of Jongno Police Station.

769
01:11:14,906 --> 01:11:16,699
-Damn it.
-You bastards.

770
01:11:17,491 --> 01:11:18,409
Jeez.

771
01:11:23,372 --> 01:11:26,000
Jangmi, easy.

772
01:11:26,083 --> 01:11:28,753
This means we have to carry them now.
Hey, newbie. Hurry.

773
01:11:28,836 --> 01:11:30,671
I'm Lieutenant Jeong
from Jongno Police Station.

774
01:11:31,505 --> 01:11:34,467
You are under arrest for violating

775
01:11:34,717 --> 01:11:36,219
the Narcotics Control Act.

776
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:39,305
I accept the people's wishes,

777
01:11:39,764 --> 01:11:43,434
and allow Prime Minister Mo
to form the cabinet.

778
01:11:50,524 --> 01:11:53,527
I will do my very best, Your Majesty.
Please trust me.

779
01:11:54,362 --> 01:11:55,571
I always have.

780
01:11:56,489 --> 01:11:59,367
Just know that I will keep my ears open
and will support you any way I can.

781
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:03,913
I will be a Prime Minister
who mostly gives written reports.

782
01:12:04,747 --> 01:12:07,625
I'd prefer it if you reported
everything to me in person every week.

783
01:12:07,708 --> 01:12:10,628
You can't possibly expect to receive
the weekly report in person...

784
01:12:12,546 --> 01:12:14,882
Fine. Then let's have it half and half.

785
01:12:19,929 --> 01:12:22,640
What are you doing, Mom?
Are you receiving an award?

786
01:12:24,058 --> 01:12:24,892
Well...

787
01:12:25,893 --> 01:12:28,688
I had to bring him
because I couldn't find a babysitter.

788
01:12:30,022 --> 01:12:32,566
Who are you, mister?

789
01:12:36,654 --> 01:12:37,697
Nice to meet you.

790
01:12:38,698 --> 01:12:40,992
I am the King of the Kingdom of Corea.

791
01:12:41,575 --> 01:12:43,661

-Come and have a look!

794
01:13:21,699 --> 01:13:23,284
