1
00:00:00,055 --> 00:00:05,021
THE KING: ETERNAL MONARCH

2
00:00:05,123 --> 00:00:07,542
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:07,626 --> 00:00:10,045
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,900
<i>It was the year
after he committed treason,</i>

5
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:34,653
<i>so it's been 24 years.</i>

6
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:37,948
EPISODE 7

7
00:00:38,031 --> 00:00:40,700
Back then and even now,

8
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:44,537
the view here is stunning.

9
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:49,209
It seems too nice

10
00:00:50,293 --> 00:00:52,462
for a traitor's resting place.

11
00:00:54,214 --> 00:00:57,509
I thought about it sometimes.

12
00:00:59,052 --> 00:01:01,555
What was that body?

13
00:01:02,722 --> 00:01:07,310
Are you still bothered by how
we announced that the guards killed him?

14
00:01:09,187 --> 00:01:14,651
Back then, that was the only way
to protect the Royal Court.

15
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:16,987
I know.

16
00:01:18,113 --> 00:01:20,407
And I made that choice.

17
00:01:23,785 --> 00:01:29,249
Sometimes, life flows
in unexpected directions.

18
00:01:33,503 --> 00:01:34,629
This is the death certificate

19
00:01:35,422 --> 00:01:38,883
where the real cause of
Prince Imperial Geum's death is written.

20
00:01:42,971 --> 00:01:44,973
Usually when two people

21
00:01:45,682 --> 00:01:48,059
have a conversation like this,
one of them kills the other.

22
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,314
That's an absurd joke...

23
00:02:01,573 --> 00:02:03,616
Is there something going on?

24
00:02:05,035 --> 00:02:08,830
What did you talk about with His Majesty?

25
00:02:09,831 --> 00:02:11,207
About the truth.

26
00:02:14,753 --> 00:02:15,754
I'm sorry,

27
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:18,673
but I hid something from you as well.

28
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:21,134
It was neither a suicide

29
00:02:22,093 --> 00:02:24,220
nor a shooting by the Royal Guards.

30
00:02:25,221 --> 00:02:26,056
That body

31
00:02:28,058 --> 00:02:30,393
wasn't Prince Imperial Geum's.

32
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:34,981
Your Highness!

33
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:38,443
<i>That traitor Lee Lim</i>

34
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:41,071
<i>is alive somewhere.</i>

35
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:54,292
<i>If the purpose of his treason</i>

36
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,336
<i>had been the Manpasikjeok</i>

37
00:02:57,087 --> 00:02:58,213
<i>and not the throne,</i>

38
00:02:59,839 --> 00:03:01,341
<i>since I have its other half,</i>

39
00:03:02,926 --> 00:03:04,302
<i>he will definitely</i>

40
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:07,472
<i>come to me to retrieve it.</i>

41
00:03:10,225 --> 00:03:11,226
<i>So</i>

42
00:03:13,144 --> 00:03:15,730
<i>Head Court Lady Noh was wrong.</i>

43
00:03:19,943 --> 00:03:22,862
<i>Jeong Tae-eul is not a danger to me.</i>

44
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:25,532
<i>I am</i>

45
00:03:26,157 --> 00:03:27,784
<i>a danger to Jeong Tae-eul.</i>

46
00:03:42,757 --> 00:03:45,343
Quick firing is a bit hard.

47
00:03:46,261 --> 00:03:47,262
Right?

48
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:52,100
What?

49
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:54,394
Did you put holes in it beforehand?

50
00:03:54,978 --> 00:03:56,813
Couldn't you have secretly
shot some on mine?

51
00:03:57,647 --> 00:03:59,274
Wow, Lieutenant Kang Sin-jae.

52
00:03:59,357 --> 00:04:01,443
I guess you'll get promoted first.

53
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:04,738
You should've just worked at
the National Police Agency headquarters.

54
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:06,740
Why would you work here when you graduated
from the National Police University?

55
00:04:06,823 --> 00:04:08,616
All your classmates
are Senior Inspectors now.

56
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:11,202
You still have no clue about me.

57
00:04:11,286 --> 00:04:13,496
I'm not jealous at all
that they're Senior Inspectors.

58
00:04:14,038 --> 00:04:16,082
Then why are you so bent
on taking the promotion test?

59
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,043
Because my friends
are all Senior Inspectors.

60
00:04:19,335 --> 00:04:21,921
Don't worry, my physical abilities
can make up for my low scores.

61
00:04:22,547 --> 00:04:24,090
It won't help with the written exam.

62
00:04:25,508 --> 00:04:27,802
Hang on. I got a call. Oh, it's our Chief.

63
00:04:30,013 --> 00:04:31,014
Yes, Chief.

64
00:04:33,141 --> 00:04:34,851
All right, I'll be there right away.

65
00:04:37,562 --> 00:04:39,063
There was a murder in Changsin-dong.

66
00:04:39,355 --> 00:04:40,356
You drive.

67
00:04:46,905 --> 00:04:48,448
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

68
00:04:49,115 --> 00:04:49,991
Your Majesty.

69
00:04:50,074 --> 00:04:51,576
Is the schedule confirmed
for China's visit?

70
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:54,913
We should wait
until you've got plenty of rest--

71
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:56,539
I want it scheduled as soon as possible.

72
00:04:57,332 --> 00:04:58,875
What other official schedules are there?

73
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:02,170
You have to go to the National Tax Service
to receive the Best Taxpayer Award.

74
00:05:02,378 --> 00:05:03,296
The people are responding

75
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:04,464
-very positively--
-Great.

76
00:05:04,964 --> 00:05:07,050
You can receive the award on my behalf.

77
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:08,218
And ask the Prime Minister's Office

78
00:05:08,301 --> 00:05:10,053
if they can make the state affairs report
in advance.

79
00:05:10,136 --> 00:05:11,095
Well...

80
00:05:11,262 --> 00:05:12,472
That is enough.

81
00:05:12,805 --> 00:05:13,973
Don't try to convince me otherwise.

82
00:05:15,558 --> 00:05:17,936
How early do you want
the state affairs report?

83
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:18,853
Tomorrow.

84
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:20,480
-Tomorrow?
-Yes.

85
00:05:20,563 --> 00:05:21,856
And if not, His Majesty
will accept a written report.

86
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,234
This is annoying.
Does he think I have time on my hands?

87
00:05:24,317 --> 00:05:25,235
Prime Minister.

88
00:05:26,152 --> 00:05:27,695
Was I being too nice these days?

89
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,906
Let's play a little hard to get.

90
00:05:30,657 --> 00:05:32,242
Just send a simple written report.

91
00:05:32,325 --> 00:05:33,451
Yes, ma'am.

92
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:38,957
Your outfits for the National Assembly
this afternoon.

93
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:42,335
We've referred to female politicians
of various countries

94
00:05:42,627 --> 00:05:43,753
and selected these suits.

95
00:05:43,836 --> 00:05:45,088
They're all pants.

96
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:48,216
Well, most of the members are males,
so we picked more masculine outfits--

97
00:05:48,299 --> 00:05:51,886
Do women in politics have to wear
suits like that to win?

98
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:54,847
I'll try to win
wearing the clothes that I like.

99
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,766
Go and have lunch.

100
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,651
What did that bitch have that I don't?

101
00:06:10,697 --> 00:06:11,739
Jangmi.

102
00:06:11,823 --> 00:06:13,199
-Hey, you're here.
-Yes.

103
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:16,286
Go, get out of here.

104
00:06:16,369 --> 00:06:17,579
I'll get the security footage.

105
00:06:17,662 --> 00:06:20,164
-Take him away from here.
-Stop contaminating the crime scene. Go.

106
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:23,418
The victim is a 26-year-old female,
and the weapon is a kitchen knife.

107
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:25,295
It was reported by her roommate.

108
00:06:26,212 --> 00:06:28,256
Okay, I'll get her statement.

109
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:29,173
Okay.

110
00:06:30,008 --> 00:06:30,884
Excuse me.

111
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:34,596
I'm Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul
from Jongno Station.

112
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:39,225
I know you're in shock, but you need to
come to the station to make a statement.

113
00:06:40,393 --> 00:06:41,436
Right now?

114
00:06:41,686 --> 00:06:42,604
Yes.

115
00:06:53,948 --> 00:06:54,824
Give me a briefing.

116
00:06:55,158 --> 00:06:56,743
There are two wounds on her neck,

117
00:06:57,368 --> 00:06:58,536
but her posture is natural.

118
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:00,830
She was attacked by surprise
while lying down.

119
00:07:02,206 --> 00:07:04,208
The first wound was critical.

120
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:06,794
With a cut this deep,
she couldn't have put up a fight.

121
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,296
There are no signs of entry

122
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,757
and she had a facial mask on.

123
00:07:10,882 --> 00:07:12,383
The killer was likely an acquaintance.

124
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,613
Why is the weapon so clean?

125
00:07:33,696 --> 00:07:35,865
The killer put it back where it was
after washing it.

126
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:37,909
They tried to get rid of the evidence.

127
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:39,118
So it's a first offender.

128
00:07:39,202 --> 00:07:41,412
Even kids know
they should wear latex gloves.

129
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,248
Hey, our vulnerable Jangmi.

130
00:07:44,332 --> 00:07:45,458
Did you find anything?

131
00:07:48,127 --> 00:07:50,463
I'm certain that Yu Jeong-hwa
from the Royal Wardrobe

132
00:07:50,546 --> 00:07:52,924
is the one who's been meeting
the Prime Minister's secretary.

133
00:07:53,549 --> 00:07:55,802
There cannot be any mistakes
regarding this issue.

134
00:07:55,885 --> 00:07:58,262
Based on when the guards changed posts,

135
00:07:58,346 --> 00:08:01,599
a total of 32 palace workers
met His Majesty in person this month.

136
00:08:02,183 --> 00:08:03,977
And 21 of them have social media accounts.

137
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,772
I followed around 40 personal accounts
that they use, and I found this.

138
00:08:08,898 --> 00:08:11,484
The same location, the same table
from a different angle,

139
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:13,069
and photos in the same style.

140
00:08:13,736 --> 00:08:14,570
And most importantly,

141
00:08:15,571 --> 00:08:17,657
their faces are reflected on these spoons.

142
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:24,998
It's totally obvious, then.

143
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:31,671
A palace worker spying on
His Majesty and spreading rumors,

144
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:35,842
and even stealing and leaking something
from the palace...

145
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:38,344
That counts as treason.

146
00:08:38,845 --> 00:08:40,471
Who put you up to this?

147
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,559
Who ordered you to spy on His Majesty?

148
00:08:47,812 --> 00:08:49,731
Head Court Lady Noh, I'm sorry.

149
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:54,235
I said His Majesty seemed to have
gotten a girlfriend,

150
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,529
but I never stole anything.

151
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,533
I was on duty on November 11th,

152
00:09:00,616 --> 00:09:02,910
and His Majesty came to the Royal Kitchen.

153
00:09:03,536 --> 00:09:05,121
And he cooked food himself.

154
00:09:05,455 --> 00:09:06,956
So I could tell right away

155
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:09,917
that his girlfriend had come.

156
00:09:12,003 --> 00:09:12,837
All right.

157
00:09:14,047 --> 00:09:15,256
I can tell

158
00:09:15,798 --> 00:09:17,258
that you are not lying.

159
00:09:18,342 --> 00:09:19,177
However,

160
00:09:20,136 --> 00:09:21,387
you are still fired.

161
00:09:26,517 --> 00:09:27,435
Come with me.

162
00:09:29,812 --> 00:09:30,646
Yes.

163
00:09:30,897 --> 00:09:32,648
Since we share a studio apartment,

164
00:09:32,732 --> 00:09:36,652
I leave the house for about an hour
whenever her boyfriend comes over.

165
00:09:37,236 --> 00:09:38,821
And where did you go?

166
00:09:39,489 --> 00:09:41,032
A convenience store nearby.

167
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:46,412
I have an audition soon,
so I read my script and went back, and...

168
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:54,504
Please tell me everything you know
about the victim's boyfriend.

169
00:09:57,256 --> 00:09:59,467
His name's Park Jung-gu.

170
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:01,928
I don't know his exact age, though.

171
00:10:03,012 --> 00:10:04,430
I think he's in his late 20s.

172
00:10:04,806 --> 00:10:06,265
I heard he's still a student.

173
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:10,103
Do you know his social media account?

174
00:10:11,395 --> 00:10:12,438
Yes.

175
00:10:15,608 --> 00:10:16,526
Here.

176
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:18,861
Thank you.

177
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:23,074
VIEW PROFILE

178
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:24,867
NAME: PARK JUNG-GU
BIRTHDAY: JUNE 6, 1992

179
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:27,537
You shouldn't leave the city or go abroad
for a while.

180
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:29,288
And answer when we contact you.

181
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,209
Name, Park Jung-gu.

182
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:35,086
Born on June 6th, 1992.

183
00:10:39,465 --> 00:10:41,926
Park Jung-gu, age 28. I have his address.

184
00:10:42,969 --> 00:10:46,514
His number matches the one
in the victim's call records. It's him.

185
00:10:46,597 --> 00:10:47,640
All right...

186
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:51,060
Detective Shim?

187
00:10:51,143 --> 00:10:52,436
We have the suspect's address.

188
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,981
I'll text it to you, so head there
right away. No detours.

189
00:10:55,898 --> 00:10:57,692
I'll go and check the witness' alibi.

190
00:10:57,817 --> 00:10:59,986
Okay, go do that.

191
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,239
All right.

192
00:11:11,122 --> 00:11:12,623
I checked Jang Yeon-ji's alibi.

193
00:11:12,874 --> 00:11:14,667
She was at the convenience store
at that time.

194
00:11:15,918 --> 00:11:17,545
I'll drop by Forensics before I head back.

195
00:11:22,508 --> 00:11:24,886
PARK MUN-HAENG OF HG GROUP'S
SUCCESSION PROCESS UNDERWAY

196
00:11:40,192 --> 00:11:42,570
It must have been a tough day.

197
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:45,031
Get some rest, Father.

198
00:12:04,717 --> 00:12:07,178
I checked the security footage
of the building Park Jung-gu lives in.

199
00:12:07,428 --> 00:12:09,388
He didn't go home after the incident.

200
00:12:10,222 --> 00:12:11,432
This jerk went into hiding.

201
00:12:12,308 --> 00:12:15,394
Forensics say a detailed autopsy report
will only be available after three weeks.

202
00:12:15,478 --> 00:12:18,230
The cause of death is excessive bleeding
from multiple wounds.

203
00:12:18,314 --> 00:12:20,483
The wounds match with the kitchen knife.

204
00:12:20,691 --> 00:12:23,152
How can we wait
three weeks for the report?

205
00:12:23,235 --> 00:12:24,987
You should've asked for Hee-ju's help.

206
00:12:25,154 --> 00:12:26,113
Didn't you mention me?

207
00:12:26,697 --> 00:12:27,907
I did. About your loneliness.

208
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,828
I see.

209
00:12:33,454 --> 00:12:37,333
You had to mention that out of
all the things you could've said about me.

210
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,709
Of course. I had to.

211
00:12:38,793 --> 00:12:40,628
I wrote and signed a note promising that

212
00:12:40,711 --> 00:12:42,463
I will never call you out
after 10 p.m. again.

213
00:12:43,047 --> 00:12:45,132
So you even wrote
and signed a note for her.

214
00:12:45,216 --> 00:12:47,802
Wow, you're really unbelievable.

215
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:49,679
We'll talk about this later.

216
00:12:50,096 --> 00:12:51,555
All right, everyone. Listen up.

217
00:12:52,223 --> 00:12:53,641
What is it? What about loneliness?

218
00:12:53,724 --> 00:12:54,850
What is it?

219
00:12:54,934 --> 00:12:57,603
What's that secret code you're using?
It sounds pretty fishy.

220
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,772
Tae-eul, you of all people

221
00:12:59,855 --> 00:13:02,942
shouldn't be asking questions like that.
Don't you think?

222
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:06,904
Out of 100 points for your promotion test,
do you know what takes up 47 points?

223
00:13:06,988 --> 00:13:09,407
The immediate supervisor's
work evaluation score?

224
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,866
That's right.

225
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,660
Usually, everyone just gets
full points for that.

226
00:13:12,743 --> 00:13:15,663
Do you want to lose all those points?

227
00:13:16,664 --> 00:13:17,790
I don't care.

228
00:13:17,873 --> 00:13:19,792
What is it?
What did you mean by "loneliness"?

229
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:22,503
I could visit Forensics tomorrow myself.

230
00:13:22,712 --> 00:13:25,047
Hey, I can just give you 470 points
on your evaluation

231
00:13:25,131 --> 00:13:27,299
and send you off to headquarters.

232
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,011
That's enough out of you. Listen up.

233
00:13:30,094 --> 00:13:33,055
Jang Yeon-ji is still one of the suspects,

234
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:34,390
so keep investigating her.

235
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,059
For now, Park Jung-gu
is our prime suspect.

236
00:13:37,143 --> 00:13:39,687
Put him on the wanted list
and find the regular routes he takes.

237
00:13:40,313 --> 00:13:41,605
And do stakeouts. That's all.

238
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:42,565
Yes, sir!

239
00:13:56,746 --> 00:13:58,080
Come on, let's go.

240
00:13:58,706 --> 00:14:00,207
It's better to just get it over with.

241
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,918
No, it's not. You have no idea.

242
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:18,559
LOTTERY
5,000 WON

243
00:14:19,143 --> 00:14:21,228
Wow, you got 5,000 won.
Let's go buy rice cake skewers.

244
00:14:21,771 --> 00:14:22,646
No.

245
00:14:23,773 --> 00:14:24,815
I'm going to save these.

246
00:14:25,316 --> 00:14:26,359
Save 5,000 won?

247
00:14:26,984 --> 00:14:30,404
Yes, I'm going to save up
and make 50 million won.

248
00:14:30,863 --> 00:14:32,823
I just have to save ten thousand of these.

249
00:14:33,657 --> 00:14:35,743
But you always buy ten thousand won
worth of lotteries.

250
00:14:46,962 --> 00:14:48,923
Where did you spend that ten thousand won?

251
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,008
What do you mean?

252
00:14:51,092 --> 00:14:54,637
You know, you got ten thousand won
when I went to the Taekwondo center.

253
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:56,138
Oh, that?

254
00:14:57,473 --> 00:14:59,392
I saved it to get double eyelid surgery.

255
00:15:01,102 --> 00:15:02,186
And?

256
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,731
What do you mean, "and"?

257
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:08,651
Look at my eyes.

258
00:15:11,112 --> 00:15:14,824
If I had managed to save it,
I'd have double eyelids right now.

259
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:16,784
But I don't.

260
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,335
So, should I get the surgery now?

261
00:15:28,504 --> 00:15:29,839
Don't waste your money.

262
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,634
You're right.

263
00:15:34,343 --> 00:15:35,970
That's why
I spent it on rice cake skewers.

264
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:42,101
But while we're on the topic...

265
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,770
I was really pretty back then.

266
00:15:45,771 --> 00:15:46,814
I was young,

267
00:15:48,107 --> 00:15:49,150
pure,

268
00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:51,110
gentle,

269
00:15:53,404 --> 00:15:54,447
and intelligent.

270
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:57,324
I only read professional books back then.

271
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,911
<i>Teaching Methods and Utilization
of Basic Taekwondo Techniques.</i>

272
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,246
Are you drunk?

273
00:16:02,913 --> 00:16:04,373
How many good words have you just misused?

274
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:06,667
What?

275
00:16:07,293 --> 00:16:08,461
Jangmi and Detective Shim are coming.

276
00:16:08,544 --> 00:16:09,962
You're going home, right?

277
00:16:11,422 --> 00:16:12,298
Yes.

278
00:16:14,592 --> 00:16:15,759
I'm finally getting off work.

279
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,762
Gosh. I wonder where Jangmi

280
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:21,640
buys clothes like that.

281
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:24,518
No one can tell we're cops
when he is with us.

282
00:16:24,727 --> 00:16:26,770
Gangsters take him with them
when they run from us.

283
00:16:50,002 --> 00:16:53,964
Your Majesty, China's Foreign Minister
and the Chinese ambassador are here.

284
00:16:57,176 --> 00:16:58,010
Let's go.

285
00:16:59,762 --> 00:17:01,096
China remembers your kindness.

286
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:04,183
Thank you very much

287
00:17:04,433 --> 00:17:07,645
for the great Kingdom and Your Majesty
who rescued the fishing boat.

288
00:17:08,896 --> 00:17:13,442
I heard
pink lotus flowers represent trust.

289
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,403
I am glad to be sharing a cup of lotus tea

290
00:17:16,695 --> 00:17:18,697
with the two representatives of China.

291
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:20,783
Thank you, Your Majesty.

292
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:22,868
To thank Your Majesty for your sincerity,

293
00:17:23,244 --> 00:17:25,037
we also prepared a gift.

294
00:17:25,287 --> 00:17:27,831
From the new year,
all citizens of the Kingdom of Corea

295
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:30,459
will be able to visit 661 cities in China

296
00:17:30,709 --> 00:17:32,711
without a visa.

297
00:17:36,966 --> 00:17:37,800
It's...

298
00:17:38,884 --> 00:17:40,344
an amazing thing

299
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:45,516
for anyone to be able to
go anywhere, at any time,

300
00:17:46,642 --> 00:17:47,977
as they wish.

301
00:17:49,728 --> 00:17:53,399
Your country's gift will be remembered
as a precious moment of history.

302
00:18:03,534 --> 00:18:05,786
-Hey, you're here.
-What?

303
00:18:06,412 --> 00:18:08,038
Why? Is it weird?

304
00:18:10,207 --> 00:18:11,667
The customers said it looked nice.

305
00:18:12,334 --> 00:18:13,252
What should I get you?

306
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:18,090
I was just startled.

307
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:20,092
My palms are sweaty.

308
00:18:20,676 --> 00:18:21,969
Did you get a haircut?

309
00:18:23,304 --> 00:18:27,766
I'll get chocolate milk tea.
Use this. And I want lots of cereal.

310
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,434
Good choice.

311
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,855
You know I always want to
cut my hair short

312
00:18:33,355 --> 00:18:34,398
around this time of year.

313
00:18:34,857 --> 00:18:36,525
I tried a simulation with a wig.

314
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,902
But I look better with long hair, right?

315
00:18:39,737 --> 00:18:43,449
You're coming here
less often these days, though.

316
00:18:44,283 --> 00:18:45,743
Are you going to a different cafe?

317
00:18:49,538 --> 00:18:50,414
Hey.

318
00:18:50,998 --> 00:18:53,208
You're much better than my dad.

319
00:18:53,584 --> 00:18:56,795
He didn't even notice
when I stayed out all night.

320
00:18:57,463 --> 00:18:59,506
You've gotten better at bluffing
since I last saw you.

321
00:19:00,132 --> 00:19:02,926
Who describes stakeouts like that?

322
00:19:03,385 --> 00:19:04,637
You were just working.

323
00:19:09,266 --> 00:19:10,934
No, it wasn't a stakeout.

324
00:19:11,894 --> 00:19:15,022
I really spent the night at a guy's house.

325
00:19:16,106 --> 00:19:17,524
His house was pretty big.

326
00:19:18,651 --> 00:19:21,070
Welcome to my palace.

327
00:19:24,657 --> 00:19:25,491
Good for you.

328
00:19:32,998 --> 00:19:34,166
It's crunchy.

329
00:19:37,961 --> 00:19:38,879
By the way, Na-ri.

330
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:41,799
Let's say

331
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,510
there's another world,

332
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:46,720
and...

333
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,932
there's someone who looks
exactly like you there.

334
00:19:51,016 --> 00:19:53,227
How would you feel

335
00:19:54,603 --> 00:19:55,896
if you meet that someone?

336
00:19:55,979 --> 00:19:57,398
Are you talking about doppelgangers?

337
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,650
I have to kill her, of course.

338
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:02,861
Hey. How can you say such a thing
in front of a detective?

339
00:20:02,945 --> 00:20:06,115
One of the doppelgangers
always ends up dying.

340
00:20:06,699 --> 00:20:07,991
That's the rule of the universe.

341
00:20:19,795 --> 00:20:21,588
Why is that the rule?

342
00:20:21,672 --> 00:20:24,258
If there's two of something
when there's just supposed to be one,

343
00:20:24,341 --> 00:20:25,884
it will cause chaos in the world.

344
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,471
One cafe in this alley is enough,

345
00:20:29,555 --> 00:20:32,099
and Hero Taekwondo center is enough
for this neighborhood.

346
00:20:32,683 --> 00:20:34,143
The world needs balance.

347
00:20:35,227 --> 00:20:38,105
Tae-eul, why else would NASA
hide the existence of aliens?

348
00:20:38,188 --> 00:20:39,398
If there are two worlds,

349
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:43,026
then one world is bound to
destroy the other.

350
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:45,904
We can't be the one that's destroyed.

351
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:00,753
I have to go now.

352
00:21:01,587 --> 00:21:02,880
Take care.

353
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:05,632
Just take me to the bamboo forest today.

354
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,721
Answer quietly, all right?

355
00:21:11,555 --> 00:21:12,931
Your Majesty!

356
00:21:24,777 --> 00:21:26,361
I didn't know Your Majesty was coming.

357
00:21:27,154 --> 00:21:28,238
Did your schedule change?

358
00:21:28,822 --> 00:21:31,241
The weather was nice,
so I just dropped by.

359
00:21:31,617 --> 00:21:33,827
-All right, Your Majesty.
-Go on with your work, then.

360
00:21:39,124 --> 00:21:40,000
Go.

361
00:21:56,183 --> 00:21:57,017
Giddy-up!

362
00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:09,655
No wonder.

363
00:22:10,447 --> 00:22:12,950
I thought it was too easy
exiting the palace.

364
00:22:13,742 --> 00:22:14,618
Were you waiting here?

365
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:16,828
Where are you going again
with your phone off?

366
00:22:17,412 --> 00:22:19,581
-Are you going to meet Luna again?
-Who's Luna?

367
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,000
Your Majesty,

368
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:23,919
you've been deceived.

369
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:27,005
That woman isn't Jeong Tae-eul.

370
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:29,132
She's a criminal called Luna.

371
00:22:29,216 --> 00:22:30,217
I'm pretty sure she's not.

372
00:22:30,801 --> 00:22:32,219
She's the one catching criminals.

373
00:22:32,302 --> 00:22:33,470
Your Majesty...

374
00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:37,975
Gangsters and the police
are all looking for that woman.

375
00:22:38,642 --> 00:22:41,478
Document forgery, theft, breaking
and entering, assault, pickpocketing...

376
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:45,315
There are hundreds of reports on her.
She just hasn't been caught yet.

377
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:47,317
So you're saying

378
00:22:48,318 --> 00:22:51,446
that there's a woman
with the same face as Jeong Tae-eul

379
00:22:52,823 --> 00:22:54,032
in this Kingdom, right?

380
00:22:56,243 --> 00:22:57,619
Not the same face.

381
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,206
-It's the same person.
-And where is this person called Luna?

382
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,250
I'm sure you would know better than anyone

383
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,252
where she is right now.

384
00:23:05,335 --> 00:23:06,670
The same face

385
00:23:08,463 --> 00:23:09,381
exists

386
00:23:10,048 --> 00:23:11,174
in the Kingdom of Corea.

387
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:14,845
Even if you look at me like that,
you can't go.

388
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,431
If you must go,
you'll either have to kill me

389
00:23:17,848 --> 00:23:18,682
or take me with you.

390
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:19,766
Make your choice.

391
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,768
-I choose number one.
-I'm better than you with swords.

392
00:23:22,352 --> 00:23:23,353
Then number two.

393
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:27,274
How can you be joking right now?

394
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,319
I told these jerks to stand by.

395
00:23:34,072 --> 00:23:36,491
<i>Don't worry about the palace
and enjoy your vacation.</i>

396
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:39,077
-Vacation?
-It's Ho-pil, right?

397
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,663
I texted Ho-pil saying

398
00:23:42,581 --> 00:23:44,291
you're going on a long vacation.

399
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,418
I'm going on vacation?

400
00:23:46,585 --> 00:23:48,295
Yes, we're leaving our horses behind.

401
00:23:49,212 --> 00:23:52,132
I believe two horses in that yard
is a bit too much.

402
00:23:52,924 --> 00:23:54,926
You didn't read the link I sent you,

403
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,054
and you won't believe me
even if I explain it to you.

404
00:23:57,137 --> 00:23:58,388
So

405
00:23:58,722 --> 00:24:00,098
I'm just going to take you there

406
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:02,184
so you can see for yourself.

407
00:24:02,267 --> 00:24:04,144
See what for myself?

408
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:05,687
What's between one and zero.

409
00:24:06,521 --> 00:24:08,523
And that Jeong Tae-eul
and the person you're chasing

410
00:24:08,899 --> 00:24:10,150
are different people.

411
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,653
And then I'll find that person

412
00:24:13,695 --> 00:24:14,905
with the same face as Tae-eul.

413
00:24:31,546 --> 00:24:32,422
Your Majesty...

414
00:24:34,716 --> 00:24:35,842
This is just the beginning.

415
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:37,969
We're going to be

416
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:40,305
entering another world now.

417
00:25:13,714 --> 00:25:15,716
Prince Imperial Geum!

418
00:25:22,556 --> 00:25:24,224
You idiot.

419
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:27,644
Don't bow to people like that
with my father's face!

420
00:25:28,687 --> 00:25:29,521
Stand up.

421
00:25:30,647 --> 00:25:32,441
Our conversation will last a while.

422
00:25:32,691 --> 00:25:34,776
Yes, Your Highness.

423
00:25:36,653 --> 00:25:37,904
So what will you do?

424
00:25:38,447 --> 00:25:40,115
The succession process is almost over

425
00:25:41,783 --> 00:25:43,952
but that idiot is dawdling.

426
00:26:02,554 --> 00:26:04,431
He's left the palace again.

427
00:26:20,238 --> 00:26:22,783
Why does he keep leaving?

428
00:26:26,286 --> 00:26:27,871
It keeps getting postponed.

429
00:26:28,455 --> 00:26:31,208
Why don't you do something?
I'm sure he'll listen to you.

430
00:26:38,924 --> 00:26:40,675
What do you want to do

431
00:26:41,134 --> 00:26:43,011
after the succession process is over?

432
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:45,764
It's simple.

433
00:26:45,847 --> 00:26:48,058
We'll say he got sick and retired

434
00:26:48,517 --> 00:26:50,977
and send him off somewhere abroad
since he's done with his work.

435
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:54,064
Do you agree with that?

436
00:26:54,856 --> 00:26:58,443
I will do as you order, Your Highness.

437
00:26:59,027 --> 00:27:00,445
He's acting like that again!

438
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:02,447
What a load of nonsense.

439
00:27:02,781 --> 00:27:04,950
I'm the one who asked you
to bring that idiot,

440
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:06,910
but he only listens to you, and not me.

441
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:08,578
-Damn it!
-The succession

442
00:27:09,955 --> 00:27:11,706
will end smoothly.

443
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,791
That's obvious!

444
00:27:12,874 --> 00:27:14,376
I'm asking when that will happen! Shit.

445
00:27:16,086 --> 00:27:19,840
And if it's nothing urgent,
let's just talk over the phone, all right?

446
00:27:20,715 --> 00:27:22,342
Stop ordering me to go back and forth...

447
00:27:25,053 --> 00:27:26,096
What?

448
00:27:26,638 --> 00:27:28,348
What?

449
00:27:30,725 --> 00:27:31,560
What...

450
00:27:32,269 --> 00:27:33,270
You...

451
00:27:40,694 --> 00:27:42,904
You should let your son
take over the business.

452
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,073
Your real son.

453
00:27:45,657 --> 00:27:47,492
Your Highness!

454
00:27:48,076 --> 00:27:49,786
Shit! You...

455
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:52,664
What are you jerks up to?

456
00:28:12,601 --> 00:28:13,894
Damn it...

457
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:39,377
No, no...

458
00:28:39,461 --> 00:28:40,879
No!

459
00:28:41,546 --> 00:28:45,300
<i>HG Group has made an official announcement
that the succession process will end</i>

460
00:28:45,383 --> 00:28:46,343
<i>by the end of the year,</i>

461
00:28:46,426 --> 00:28:49,304
<i>and that Chairman Park Mun-haeng

462
00:28:50,263 --> 00:28:52,849
<i>The succession that has been
taking place for two years</i>

463
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:54,267
<i>is finally coming to a close.</i>

464
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,645
<i>Chairman Park's son, Park Byeong-u,</i>

465
00:28:56,728 --> 00:28:59,689
<i>will become the next chairman

466
00:29:02,692 --> 00:29:04,277
<i>Take good care of the palace.</i>

467
00:29:04,361 --> 00:29:05,820
<i>I'm taking Yeong with me.</i>

468
00:29:06,029 --> 00:29:08,114
<i>I'll come back in time by Friday,

469
00:29:09,074 --> 00:29:10,075
<i>Your King.</i>

470
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:14,955
Oh, my head. Oh, my heart.

471
00:29:30,804 --> 00:29:31,846
<i>It was neither a suicide</i>

472
00:29:32,555 --> 00:29:36,017
<i>nor a shooting by the Royal Guards.</i>

473
00:29:36,518 --> 00:29:37,727
That body

474
00:29:38,228 --> 00:29:40,689
wasn't Prince Imperial Geum's.

475
00:29:47,445 --> 00:29:49,656
Secretary Mo, it's me.

476
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,996
Tell the portrait painter tomorrow morning
to finish up the painting quickly.

477
00:29:57,622 --> 00:30:01,501
It looks like His Majesty is wearing
a white outfit stained with blood.

478
00:30:01,876 --> 00:30:03,461
It makes me uncomfortable.

479
00:30:10,385 --> 00:30:12,304

00:30:31,281 --> 00:30:35,285
Then let's say it's Kim Gae-ddong

00:30:35,368 --> 00:30:36,286

491
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,855
I thought my name was
not supposed to be called,

492
00:31:06,441 --> 00:31:08,443
but I guess it was supposed to be called
only by you.

493
00:31:12,364 --> 00:31:14,449
LEE GON

494
00:31:25,752 --> 00:31:28,046
SAVE CHANGES?

495
00:31:39,474 --> 00:31:41,351
DO NOT SAVE

00:31:41,976 --> 00:31:47,774
HERO TAEKWONDO CENTER

497
00:32:22,684 --> 00:32:23,601
How

498
00:32:25,437 --> 00:32:26,521
have you been?

499
00:32:31,693 --> 00:32:32,819
Have you been waiting for me?

500
00:32:37,866 --> 00:32:38,741
That's a relief.

501
00:32:41,619 --> 00:32:42,620
I was a bit scared

502
00:32:45,373 --> 00:32:46,458
that you didn't

503
00:32:47,292 --> 00:32:48,877
want me to come back--

504
00:33:17,558 --> 00:33:19,268
How do you have the key?

505
00:33:20,478 --> 00:33:21,687
Did you meet my dad?

506
00:33:22,063 --> 00:33:23,106
He seemed happy to see me,

507
00:33:23,398 --> 00:33:25,191
but he was sad
that I didn't bring Maximus.

508
00:33:26,109 --> 00:33:27,318
I borrowed the key for a while.

509
00:33:27,402 --> 00:33:29,320
You borrowed the key? Why?

510
00:33:29,404 --> 00:33:30,863
Oh, my god!

511
00:33:31,531 --> 00:33:32,615
Hey, Jo Eun-sup.

512
00:33:34,784 --> 00:33:35,743
What are you doing here?

513
00:33:36,327 --> 00:33:37,286
Where are the twins?

514
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,122
You should've brought them.

515
00:33:40,706 --> 00:33:42,917
Hey, but what's with your outfit?

516
00:33:43,459 --> 00:33:45,044
And your hair...

517
00:33:49,632 --> 00:33:50,675
You're not

518
00:33:52,802 --> 00:33:53,678
Eun-sup.

519
00:33:59,434 --> 00:34:02,520
<i>That bitch doesn't have a home
or an identity.</i>

520
00:34:03,104 --> 00:34:05,648
<i>We must get her while she's in our sight.
Otherwise, we can't.</i>

521
00:34:06,858 --> 00:34:09,902
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul...

522
00:34:11,863 --> 00:34:13,281
You brought Jo Yeong here?

523
00:34:13,364 --> 00:34:14,699
It was unavoidable.

524
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,784
He wouldn't let me go alone.

525
00:34:17,368 --> 00:34:18,411
What is this place?

526
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,371
I totally understand

527
00:34:21,456 --> 00:34:22,748
how you feel.

528
00:34:23,791 --> 00:34:27,003
I'm sure we both have a lot of things
to worry about,

529
00:34:27,837 --> 00:34:31,757
but for now, welcome to
the Republic of Korea.

530
00:34:31,841 --> 00:34:33,134
Republic...

531
00:34:33,801 --> 00:34:35,720
<i>I heard Captain Jo went on vacation.</i>

532
00:34:37,138 --> 00:34:39,724
Yes, he only sent one text
to the sub-captain,

533
00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:41,350
so the team is worried.

534
00:34:42,143 --> 00:34:45,688
He's getting some rest
while His Majesty is staying in his study.

535
00:34:46,355 --> 00:34:48,941
He'll be back around Thursday evening,
so don't worry.

536
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:51,110
I have a job for you in the meanwhile.

537
00:34:51,986 --> 00:34:53,529
Yes, Head Court Lady Noh.

538
00:34:57,158 --> 00:35:02,330
Bring me a list of court workers on duty
and the people who visited the palace

539
00:35:03,372 --> 00:35:06,125
from November 11
to midnight the day after.

540
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:11,005
Check anyone who has ever
so much as touched the palace.

541
00:35:13,257 --> 00:35:14,759
What about the one you fired last time?

542
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,220
No.

543
00:35:17,845 --> 00:35:19,597
She's not the thief I'm looking for.

544
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:21,807
It's someone else.

545
00:35:33,486 --> 00:35:34,695
I can't even get a signal.

546
00:35:36,989 --> 00:35:38,449
I've never seen him act like that.

547
00:35:39,617 --> 00:35:41,160
He looks so cute when he's flustered.

548
00:35:42,245 --> 00:35:44,830
Your carefree attitude is what's cute.

549
00:35:45,206 --> 00:35:47,124
How can you just bring someone
with the same face?

550
00:35:47,708 --> 00:35:49,585
What are you going to do
if he gets caught?

551
00:35:49,961 --> 00:35:51,379
That's why I borrowed this place.

552
00:35:52,547 --> 00:35:54,173
Yeong isn't the type to get caught easily.

553
00:35:57,843 --> 00:35:58,886
It's King Arthur!

554
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,846
The lights were on, so I was wondering...

555
00:36:16,821 --> 00:36:18,114
Eun...

556
00:36:23,452 --> 00:36:24,745
You two haven't met, right?

557
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:26,163
Why don't I introduce...

558
00:36:30,543 --> 00:36:32,920
Well, I guess we could say
you've met already.

559
00:36:34,338 --> 00:36:36,799
Anyway, this is my guard,
the Unbreakable Sword, Jo Yeong.

560
00:36:36,882 --> 00:36:38,926
And this is a guard of a police station...

561
00:36:41,554 --> 00:36:43,264
Hey! Jo Eun-sup!

562
00:36:45,683 --> 00:36:47,476
I can't believe it! You made him faint!

563
00:36:48,311 --> 00:36:50,354
What? Did you say he wouldn't get caught?

564
00:36:51,063 --> 00:36:53,816
Eun-sup was also raised
as a precious only child

565
00:36:53,899 --> 00:36:56,277
until his twin siblings were born.

566
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,195
What are you going to do
if something happens to him?

567
00:36:58,279 --> 00:36:59,405
Eun-sup!

568
00:36:59,488 --> 00:37:00,531
Jo Eun-sup!

569
00:37:01,157 --> 00:37:02,158
Oh, my gosh!

570
00:37:02,742 --> 00:37:03,951
What happened?

571
00:37:04,035 --> 00:37:05,995
Tae-eul...

572
00:37:06,746 --> 00:37:10,291
I literally just saw someone
who looked exactly like me...

573
00:37:12,043 --> 00:37:12,918
Wow...

574
00:37:13,919 --> 00:37:14,920
He's right here.

575
00:37:20,718 --> 00:37:21,927
What the hell is this?

576
00:37:24,263 --> 00:37:25,598
He looks exactly like me.

577
00:37:27,683 --> 00:37:28,684
No.

578
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,811
He is me.

579
00:37:33,773 --> 00:37:34,982
Who are you?

580
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:36,651
And who are you?

581
00:37:38,736 --> 00:37:39,612
Eun-sup.

582
00:37:39,945 --> 00:37:41,113
Let me explain.

583
00:37:41,697 --> 00:37:44,283
So this is like a parallel universe
or something.

584
00:37:44,367 --> 00:37:46,202
Don't get too startled, all right?

585
00:37:47,286 --> 00:37:50,623
I didn't realize until now,
but I'm pretty handsome.

586
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:54,460
You really didn't know?

587
00:37:56,337 --> 00:37:57,505
How could you not know?

588
00:37:58,714 --> 00:38:01,175
I'm sure people around you
would've told you all the time.

589
00:38:01,342 --> 00:38:04,303
Why didn't you tell me?

590
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,141
Hang on, that's not the point here.

591
00:38:11,852 --> 00:38:14,855
So then this means
everything was true, right?

592
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:17,358
The Kingdom of Corea really exists,

593
00:38:17,441 --> 00:38:19,527
and King Arthur here really is the King?

594
00:38:19,735 --> 00:38:20,569
Wow.

595
00:38:21,237 --> 00:38:22,071
Wow...

596
00:38:22,738 --> 00:38:25,991
Then you're the King's bodyguard, right?

597
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:27,326
No.

598
00:38:30,287 --> 00:38:31,831
Are you doing military duties right now?

599
00:38:32,206 --> 00:38:33,416
Yes.

600
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:36,335
-Is military service compulsory here?
-What do you mean?

601
00:38:36,419 --> 00:38:37,753
Is it different where you live?

602
00:38:37,837 --> 00:38:40,756
-We have a volunteer military system.
-Yes, I guess it could be different.

603
00:38:41,507 --> 00:38:44,593
What? Then you don't need to...

604
00:38:51,684 --> 00:38:52,643
Why don't we

605
00:38:53,811 --> 00:38:55,563
go to his house first?

606
00:38:55,896 --> 00:38:57,356
It'll be the safest there.

607
00:39:01,694 --> 00:39:03,195
What's that guy doing?

608
00:39:04,822 --> 00:39:07,032
A security check. It's his job.

609
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,536
Everything is clear.

610
00:39:11,203 --> 00:39:14,039
Wow, I guess you can tell
just by looking around.

611
00:39:14,123 --> 00:39:16,125
You look pretty professional.

612
00:39:16,876 --> 00:39:18,002
Why don't you?

613
00:39:19,628 --> 00:39:23,924
I guess you don't know,
but I'm his Unbreakable Sword.

614
00:39:24,049 --> 00:39:27,344
Your boss wouldn't have been
able to go home if it weren't for me.

615
00:39:27,428 --> 00:39:28,345
Did you even know that?

616
00:39:31,432 --> 00:39:32,308
Well...

617
00:39:33,309 --> 00:39:34,477
Something came up.

618
00:39:36,604 --> 00:39:38,814
What would you know?

619
00:39:40,733 --> 00:39:41,609
Your Majesty,

620
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,112
I just realized my 63rd dream.

621
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,406
In my next life,

622
00:39:48,073 --> 00:39:50,743
I really want to be
a citizen of your Kingdom.

623
00:39:55,289 --> 00:39:56,290
I won't allow that.

624
00:39:57,917 --> 00:40:00,044
All right, why don't we have dinner first?

625
00:40:00,961 --> 00:40:02,797
How about half and half?

626
00:40:03,672 --> 00:40:04,965
Yeong should try it too.

627
00:40:05,758 --> 00:40:08,844
You're crazy.
How can you think about chicken right now?

628
00:40:08,928 --> 00:40:10,137
I'll shoot him if you order me to.

629
00:40:10,763 --> 00:40:11,847
What...

630
00:40:15,851 --> 00:40:17,812
Hey! Put that down.

631
00:40:17,978 --> 00:40:20,439
You can't use a gun! It's illegal here.

632
00:40:28,948 --> 00:40:31,367
Both of you, sit down.

633
00:40:47,174 --> 00:40:48,384
We need to make some rules.

634
00:40:49,927 --> 00:40:52,638
You'll stay here until you find
another place to stay.

635
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:55,683
And you shouldn't
be outside at the same time.

636
00:40:55,933 --> 00:40:58,102
During the day, Eun-sup can go out.

637
00:40:58,269 --> 00:40:59,812
And Mr. Jo can go out at night.

638
00:41:00,479 --> 00:41:01,897
-Why should I?
-Why should I do that?

639
00:41:03,107 --> 00:41:04,567
Do you have a death wish?

640
00:41:05,067 --> 00:41:05,901
No.

641
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:08,863
I'm talking to both of you.

642
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:13,868
If it's a problem that we look identical,
we can solve it by eliminating one.

643
00:41:17,413 --> 00:41:18,581
What?

644
00:41:20,165 --> 00:41:22,042
Why are you all looking at me?

645
00:41:22,793 --> 00:41:24,587
Wait.

646
00:41:24,837 --> 00:41:27,965
Gosh, I was trying to live a quiet life
without causing trouble.

647
00:41:28,132 --> 00:41:29,800
Don't regret this later saying

648
00:41:29,884 --> 00:41:32,761
"I didn't know you'd do this," okay?

649
00:41:33,762 --> 00:41:34,680
Eun-sup.

650
00:41:35,306 --> 00:41:37,516
I got you fruit and some other stuff.

651
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:40,060
Don't leave the house, okay?

652
00:41:43,731 --> 00:41:45,816
And Mr. Lee, follow me.

653
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,693
How dare you call His Majesty that...

654
00:41:50,237 --> 00:41:52,281
Is this how they've been
treating you here?

655
00:41:52,823 --> 00:41:53,782
Yes,

656
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,576
I missed it.

657
00:41:56,577 --> 00:41:59,246
She used to just call me
"Hey" or "Mister."

658
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:00,956
Hey...

659
00:42:02,499 --> 00:42:04,335
Don't kill him,
he belongs to the government.

660
00:42:21,268 --> 00:42:22,353
Where are your parents?

661
00:42:22,478 --> 00:42:24,813
In Busan. I'm from Busan.

662
00:42:27,191 --> 00:42:28,943
Do your parents have the same faces, too?

663
00:42:32,696 --> 00:42:33,697
Who are they?

664
00:42:34,907 --> 00:42:35,866
Did you get married?

665
00:42:37,034 --> 00:42:38,243
They're my twin siblings.

666
00:42:38,327 --> 00:42:39,954
They're in Busan for the holidays.

667
00:42:41,497 --> 00:42:42,498
Don't you have siblings?

668
00:42:43,374 --> 00:42:44,625
No, I'm an only child.

669
00:42:46,126 --> 00:42:47,002
An only child.

670
00:42:47,586 --> 00:42:51,590
Well, I guess your parents
weren't as close as mine.

671
00:42:52,424 --> 00:42:53,467
They got divorced.

672
00:42:56,637 --> 00:42:57,805
Oh, I'm sorry.

673
00:43:01,308 --> 00:43:02,351
Do you want a hug?

674
00:43:03,352 --> 00:43:05,938
Gosh! You really have a bad personality!

675
00:43:06,522 --> 00:43:08,357
I bet you don't even have a girlfriend.

676
00:43:08,983 --> 00:43:09,817
Neither do you.

677
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:10,859
I have a boyfriend.

678
00:43:11,944 --> 00:43:13,570
-What?
-Did you believe that?

679
00:43:14,238 --> 00:43:15,239
You're more gullible than I thought.

680
00:43:15,823 --> 00:43:17,241
Did you eat?
If you didn't, I'll make something.

681
00:43:18,575 --> 00:43:20,869
Nobody is stupid enough
to eat at an enemy's camp.

682
00:43:23,247 --> 00:43:26,125
Do you guys usually talk
like you're in a historical drama?

683
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,669
Come to think of it,
you don't talk in a dialect.

684
00:43:29,962 --> 00:43:31,338
I can use standard Korean, too.

685
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:35,300
Do you want to eat something?
Would you like some noodles?

686
00:43:35,384 --> 00:43:37,011
Is there anything you can do properly?

687
00:43:37,886 --> 00:43:40,848
How can someone have 63 dreams?
Are you making deposit accounts or what?

688
00:43:41,557 --> 00:43:43,642
Which one has the highest
chance of getting fulfilled?

689
00:43:45,227 --> 00:43:47,354
Becoming a civilian, of course.

690
00:43:47,438 --> 00:43:50,649
I'm fulfilling that dream in two days.
My military service ends in two days.

691
00:43:50,733 --> 00:43:53,652
In two days you'll become a bum
who doesn't even protect the country?

692
00:43:54,236 --> 00:43:56,613
Hey, you're pretty harsh.

693
00:43:56,697 --> 00:44:00,034
You know, you might have
more muscles than me,

694
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:01,785
but I'm pretty good at fighting too.

695
00:44:01,869 --> 00:44:03,287
Try me.

696
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:09,418
Don't think about shooting me from behind.

697
00:44:11,253 --> 00:44:12,421
The Republic of Korea...

698
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:15,007
What kind of country is this

699
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:17,176
to let a fool like you
protect the country?

700
00:44:35,027 --> 00:44:37,613
TAEKWONDO CENTER

701
00:44:44,953 --> 00:44:47,039
Here, this is my MSD.

702
00:44:47,122 --> 00:44:49,249
Try it. It's <i>somaek</i>. Drink all of it.

703
00:44:56,632 --> 00:44:57,758
It's quite similar.

704
00:45:01,303 --> 00:45:02,888
Unlike someone,
I live off of chicken feed of a salary

705
00:45:02,971 --> 00:45:04,556
and I don't have a mountain
full of rare-earth elements.

706
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,850
So I bought it
with a 12-month installment plan.

707
00:45:07,226 --> 00:45:10,020
Don't break it and take care of it.
Don't forget to answer my calls.

708
00:45:11,105 --> 00:45:13,649
I saved all the numbers you will need
in this world.

709
00:45:13,732 --> 00:45:15,567
It seems like you bought it
and waited for me to come back.

710
00:45:20,614 --> 00:45:22,074
Why did you save Sin-jae's number?

711
00:45:22,157 --> 00:45:24,409
They are the five people who will help you

712
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:26,537
regardless of what in this world.

713
00:45:27,204 --> 00:45:29,456
And Sin-jae
is one of the most trustworthy people.

714
00:45:29,832 --> 00:45:30,874
Not you?

715
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:32,376
For me, the citizens come first.

716
00:45:38,048 --> 00:45:39,216
Who are you calling?

717
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:46,682
LEE GON

718
00:45:49,935 --> 00:45:50,811
Is it you?

719
00:45:52,271 --> 00:45:54,189
-Hang up.
-Don't hang up.

720
00:45:54,857 --> 00:45:56,316
I always wanted to try this.

721
00:45:57,151 --> 00:45:58,360
What is this?

722
00:45:58,610 --> 00:45:59,987
Just a normal daily life with you.

723
00:46:00,279 --> 00:46:01,822
Call you...

724
00:46:01,905 --> 00:46:03,699
Chat on the phone...

725
00:46:04,616 --> 00:46:06,118
Ask you what you did today...

726
00:46:06,994 --> 00:46:08,954
And tell you that I missed you

727
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:10,664
a lot.

728
00:46:15,335 --> 00:46:16,461
Me too.

729
00:46:17,921 --> 00:46:18,755
I see.

730
00:46:20,841 --> 00:46:22,259
Here is the chicken you ordered.

731
00:46:22,342 --> 00:46:23,510
Enjoy.

732
00:46:32,769 --> 00:46:35,981
I'm tasting it beforehand
since I can't cook.

733
00:46:37,733 --> 00:46:38,734
You don't have to.

734
00:46:39,276 --> 00:46:41,278
I know our worlds
are completely different.

735
00:46:42,446 --> 00:46:43,614
But let's try to shorten the gap.

736
00:46:52,956 --> 00:46:54,291
This also tastes great.

737
00:46:55,876 --> 00:46:57,085
Fine, but let go of my hand.

738
00:46:57,169 --> 00:46:58,170
Never.

739
00:46:58,253 --> 00:46:59,421
Then grab my left hand.

740
00:47:10,015 --> 00:47:11,225
Why did you put those sunglasses on?

741
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,644
We have somewhere to go after we eat.

742
00:47:14,228 --> 00:47:16,396
It's a daily life I've been planning
for a long time.

743
00:47:17,189 --> 00:47:19,900
You know, I get nervous
when you equip something.

744
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:22,945
Is this the place?

745
00:47:26,156 --> 00:47:26,990
Welcome...

746
00:47:28,367 --> 00:47:29,952
Oh, it's you again.

747
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,956
You brought your girlfriend today.

748
00:47:34,248 --> 00:47:37,251
If you hit the target seven times,
you can win this.

749
00:47:37,417 --> 00:47:39,002
How many bullets do you want?

750
00:47:39,586 --> 00:47:41,088
Seven is enough.

751
00:47:41,171 --> 00:47:43,465
Right, of course.

752
00:47:43,882 --> 00:47:46,009
Are you going to try this time?

753
00:47:46,301 --> 00:47:48,053
Right. You can hit them
with your eyes closed

754
00:47:48,136 --> 00:47:50,138
if you have a boyfriend
who's served in the military.

755
00:47:50,264 --> 00:47:51,265
Yes.

756
00:48:10,033 --> 00:48:11,618
Did you have a boyfriend
who's served in the military?

757
00:48:11,702 --> 00:48:13,412
"With my eyes closed" is the point here.

758
00:48:25,465 --> 00:48:26,758
Can you really see with that on?

759
00:48:28,677 --> 00:48:32,597
Shooting is the act of filling the void
between me and the target.

760
00:48:32,681 --> 00:48:34,725
It's too late if you shoot after you look.
You need to look after you shoot.

761
00:48:34,933 --> 00:48:36,893
What else do you need?
Should I shoot down a star for you? Bang!

762
00:48:40,022 --> 00:48:41,148
Are you sure you earned this?

763
00:48:41,565 --> 00:48:42,649
Or did you just pay for it?

764
00:48:44,651 --> 00:48:46,653
If we have time,
let's go to Hongdae next time.

765
00:48:46,737 --> 00:48:49,239
There's a teddy bear as big as you.

766
00:48:49,323 --> 00:48:50,449
Hongdae?

767
00:48:51,491 --> 00:48:52,868
Is that the name of a neighborhood?

768
00:48:54,328 --> 00:48:55,203
Then do you know

769
00:48:55,829 --> 00:48:58,957
what "the relationship between
Hongdae and Kondae" means?

770
00:48:59,041 --> 00:49:01,835
They're both universities.
They're not that close to each other.

771
00:49:02,336 --> 00:49:03,337
Who told you about that?

772
00:49:04,338 --> 00:49:05,380
I know I have just met you,

773
00:49:06,089 --> 00:49:08,133
but what exactly is the relationship
between you and Lieutenant Jeong?

774
00:49:08,216 --> 00:49:09,551
The relationship between
Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny?

775
00:49:10,927 --> 00:49:12,512
The relationship between two and three?

776
00:49:12,596 --> 00:49:14,306
The relationship between
Hongdae and Kondae?

777
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:18,310
So it's not close.

778
00:49:18,393 --> 00:49:20,979
But I like both places.

779
00:49:22,939 --> 00:49:25,150
Why do you like them?
When they're so far away?

780
00:49:25,233 --> 00:49:26,610
Why are you taking his side?

781
00:49:27,444 --> 00:49:28,487
Take whose side?

782
00:49:29,279 --> 00:49:30,405
What are we even talking about?

783
00:49:30,614 --> 00:49:31,573
You don't need to know.

784
00:49:32,991 --> 00:49:34,826
How can you be a detective
when you have no clue

785
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:36,036
about how people feel?

786
00:49:38,663 --> 00:49:39,539
Just forget it.

787
00:49:40,582 --> 00:49:41,875
Let's go back to our daily life.

788
00:49:43,168 --> 00:49:45,253
I need to be comforted.

789
00:49:45,837 --> 00:49:47,130
So I will hold your hand.

790
00:49:51,468 --> 00:49:52,719
Let's not do this.

791
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:55,847
We don't know
when we'll see each other again.

792
00:50:11,113 --> 00:50:12,531
Answer me without letting me go.

793
00:50:12,781 --> 00:50:13,615
I won't.

794
00:50:14,866 --> 00:50:17,202
I wanted to ask as soon as I saw you,
but I was holding back.

795
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:22,207
I waited for you as a detective,
but also as myself all this time.

796
00:50:29,089 --> 00:50:30,590
Has something happened?

797
00:50:31,675 --> 00:50:33,468
Were you threatened by someone?

798
00:50:36,596 --> 00:50:37,514
I guess that means

799
00:50:38,807 --> 00:50:39,850
it will happen.

800
00:50:42,227 --> 00:50:43,228
That's why you came.

801
00:50:44,688 --> 00:50:45,605
What is it?

802
00:50:48,233 --> 00:50:49,484
Is there

803
00:50:50,277 --> 00:50:51,528
a dome stadium

804
00:50:52,529 --> 00:50:54,656
named K Stadium
in the northern region there?

805
00:50:56,074 --> 00:50:57,826
With 16,890 seats?

806
00:50:59,035 --> 00:51:00,162
How do you know that?

807
00:51:01,246 --> 00:51:02,372
Did you look that up too?

808
00:51:06,209 --> 00:51:07,085
We're screwed.

809
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,383
Give this to Director Hwang
of the care center.

810
00:51:13,467 --> 00:51:14,885
It's this month's electricity fees.

811
00:51:17,929 --> 00:51:19,848
Why are you giving him money
two days in advance?

812
00:51:20,432 --> 00:51:21,808
He'll take it for granted soon.

813
00:51:25,061 --> 00:51:25,979
Are you going to the other world again?

814
00:51:26,062 --> 00:51:27,481
I do everything in advance,

815
00:51:28,023 --> 00:51:30,692
but I won't bring the man with your face
too quickly, so don't worry.

816
00:51:35,447 --> 00:51:37,282
You can never be sure
about people, though.

817
00:51:42,662 --> 00:51:45,040
US PRESIDENT TRUMP VISITS NORTH KOREA

818
00:51:45,874 --> 00:51:46,917
People...

819
00:51:49,085 --> 00:51:52,172
<i>The northern K Stadium created a big buzz
even before its construction.</i>

820
00:51:52,255 --> 00:51:53,924
<i>As the first-ever dome stadium,</i>

821
00:51:54,007 --> 00:51:56,593
<i>it is four-stories tall,
and has two basement levels</i>

822
00:51:56,676 --> 00:51:58,595
<i>with a seating capacity of 16,890...</i>

823
00:52:00,222 --> 00:52:01,097
Is it?

824
00:52:02,182 --> 00:52:04,434
Yes, it's news from my world.

825
00:52:05,894 --> 00:52:07,395
But you found it here?

826
00:52:11,608 --> 00:52:12,901
Who else knows about this?

827
00:52:14,236 --> 00:52:15,320
Just me for now.

828
00:52:16,404 --> 00:52:19,032
I can't really tell anyone about this.
Nobody will believe it anyway.

829
00:52:20,283 --> 00:52:21,826
What are you thinking of doing?

830
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:23,119
I need to investigate further.

831
00:52:23,787 --> 00:52:25,664
This was my case

832
00:52:26,748 --> 00:52:27,832
before I even met you.

833
00:52:29,709 --> 00:52:31,878
It could be more dangerous than you think.

834
00:52:34,339 --> 00:52:36,758
That's why I thought about
just covering it up.

835
00:52:37,801 --> 00:52:38,635
But

836
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:42,514
if I cover it up,
then no one will ever find out about this

837
00:52:44,558 --> 00:52:47,561
since there would be only two people
who know about this.

838
00:52:49,271 --> 00:52:50,146
Me

839
00:52:50,855 --> 00:52:51,982
and the culprit.

840
00:52:53,191 --> 00:52:55,235
The two worlds
shouldn't get mixed up like this.

841
00:52:56,444 --> 00:52:58,572
They're supposed to stay
on their respective paths.

842
00:52:59,739 --> 00:53:00,574
But

843
00:53:01,575 --> 00:53:03,368
the two worlds are already colliding,

844
00:53:04,035 --> 00:53:05,203
and I've discovered it.

845
00:53:06,913 --> 00:53:09,124
So what else could I do?
I decided to investigate.

846
00:53:11,376 --> 00:53:13,211
I'm a police officer
in the Republic of Korea.

847
00:53:19,259 --> 00:53:21,886
So tell me anything you know about this.

848
00:53:22,721 --> 00:53:25,015
This is a cooperative investigation
that only we can do.

849
00:53:32,022 --> 00:53:33,440
And the order of command?

850
00:53:34,232 --> 00:53:35,775
I'm your superior, of course.

851
00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:37,444
I give the orders here.

852
00:53:51,207 --> 00:53:52,500
You've been carrying this around?

853
00:53:53,543 --> 00:53:56,546
You're carrying lots of stuff around.

854
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:04,429
Lee Lim? That's...

855
00:54:04,512 --> 00:54:06,264
Yes, the traitor.

856
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:08,975
If he's alive, he'll be 69 right now.

857
00:54:09,851 --> 00:54:12,479
You should find someone who matches
his age, blood type, and fingerprints.

858
00:54:13,521 --> 00:54:16,232
In my world, his body was found
the year after he committed treason.

859
00:54:17,067 --> 00:54:17,984
But the body

860
00:54:19,277 --> 00:54:20,362
was someone else's.

861
00:54:21,446 --> 00:54:22,656
If Lee Lim is alive...

862
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,035
He's here

863
00:54:28,495 --> 00:54:29,913
using that body's identity.

864
00:54:29,996 --> 00:54:31,081
That's right.

865
00:54:32,415 --> 00:54:36,920
We have to figure out what
he's done here for the past 24 years.

866
00:54:40,382 --> 00:54:41,299
I'll look into it.

867
00:54:41,591 --> 00:54:44,844
But until I find something,
do just 17 things.

868
00:54:46,805 --> 00:54:47,972
Stay quiet,

869
00:54:48,348 --> 00:54:51,476
don't draw people's attention,
don't tell anyone you're a king,

870
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:55,188
keep Jo Yeong out of trouble,
don't use any guns,

871
00:54:55,271 --> 00:54:57,941
contact me whenever you go somewhere,

872
00:54:59,442 --> 00:55:02,320
and I'll tell you the rest
when I think of any.

873
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:04,989
I'll do as you order.

874
00:55:06,991 --> 00:55:08,702
Do just two things for me.

875
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:12,414
Don't tell me not to come,

876
00:55:13,289 --> 00:55:14,290
and don't tell me

877
00:55:15,375 --> 00:55:16,251
not to leave.

878
00:55:18,545 --> 00:55:22,549
I have to go back sometimes,
and when I do, I want to come back soon.

879
00:55:23,591 --> 00:55:24,843
Whichever it is,

880
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:26,970
if you tell me not to come or leave,

881
00:55:28,054 --> 00:55:29,723
I don't think I'll be able to do anything.

882
00:55:33,893 --> 00:55:34,853
So

883
00:55:36,563 --> 00:55:38,565
I'm asking you not to get exhausted.

884
00:55:44,446 --> 00:55:45,488
I feel like a lousy man

885
00:55:47,198 --> 00:55:48,783
after saying that.

886
00:55:50,368 --> 00:55:51,536
Am I?

887
00:55:56,499 --> 00:56:00,879
I'm confused about which part
you were nodding to.

888
00:56:04,507 --> 00:56:05,550
You should go now.

889
00:56:06,009 --> 00:56:07,427
Yeong will be waiting for you.

890
00:56:07,761 --> 00:56:09,763
He'll be anxious
since he doesn't know where you are.

891
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:12,348
Why would you think Yeong
doesn't know where I am?

892
00:56:16,352 --> 00:56:18,563
He's following us around here too?

893
00:56:19,439 --> 00:56:20,940
I guess I've made you curious.

894
00:56:22,108 --> 00:56:23,109
I'll be off now.

895
00:56:24,486 --> 00:56:25,361
There's something else

896
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,740
I'm curious about.

897
00:56:30,366 --> 00:56:32,202
Am I really not in your world?

898
00:56:33,161 --> 00:56:35,497
Eun-sup and Jo Yeong,
Na-ri and that palace worker...

899
00:56:36,331 --> 00:56:37,457
Even this person

900
00:56:37,832 --> 00:56:39,667
had the same face.

901
00:56:41,127 --> 00:56:42,295
Do I really not exist there?

902
00:56:48,968 --> 00:56:49,969
I do, don't I?

903
00:56:59,896 --> 00:57:01,731
How is it sleeping in the night duty room?

904
00:57:06,027 --> 00:57:07,237
My wages are garnished, right?

905
00:57:08,196 --> 00:57:10,824
Come on, don't say it like that.

906
00:57:11,157 --> 00:57:13,368
There's an official term for that.

907
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:14,661
Seizure.

908
00:57:16,663 --> 00:57:17,705
I'll get it handled soon.

909
00:57:18,498 --> 00:57:21,167
The night duty room smells nice.
It's good.

910
00:57:22,335 --> 00:57:23,670
Of course, it does.

911
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:26,881
Jangmi handed out questionnaires
asking what flower you liked.

912
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:30,009
It took three whole days
to decide that it was lavender.

913
00:57:33,263 --> 00:57:34,138
Next time,

914
00:57:34,764 --> 00:57:37,100
tell him I like mugwort.

915
00:57:37,183 --> 00:57:38,935
Mugwort?

916
00:57:53,533 --> 00:57:54,784
Why? Is something outside?

917
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:56,619
Is it snowing?

918
00:57:58,663 --> 00:58:00,081
Do you still like snow at your age?

919
00:58:01,708 --> 00:58:03,209
I really like snow.

920
00:58:03,918 --> 00:58:05,587
I get teary when it snows.

921
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:08,047
Well, it's not snowing much this year.

922
00:58:09,173 --> 00:58:11,301
Hey, the beef is burning.

923
00:58:11,593 --> 00:58:14,679
Do you think they flip themselves over
when it gets hot?

924
00:58:14,846 --> 00:58:15,930
My gosh.

925
00:58:16,347 --> 00:58:18,349
You never had expensive beef before,
have you?

926
00:58:37,327 --> 00:58:38,369
Sin-jae.

927
00:58:40,413 --> 00:58:41,664
Sin-jae.

928
00:58:41,748 --> 00:58:44,000
Honey! Honey, Sin-jae is awake!

929
00:58:44,083 --> 00:58:46,294
Sin-jae. Can you recognize me?

930
00:58:47,378 --> 00:58:49,005
<i>Sin-jae.</i>

931
00:59:00,141 --> 00:59:01,768
I found someone
with matching fingerprints.

932
00:59:02,936 --> 00:59:05,271
Lee Seong-jae, died 24 years ago.

933
00:59:05,897 --> 00:59:08,358
He died from natural causes
at Yangsun Care Center.

934
00:59:08,691 --> 00:59:09,901
What case is this for?

935
00:59:10,902 --> 00:59:13,780
Well, I got a report.

936
00:59:16,658 --> 00:59:18,701
Born 1951, same blood type...

937
00:59:21,663 --> 00:59:22,914
Class two physical disability?

938
00:59:22,997 --> 00:59:25,291
He was born with poliomyelitis.
Call me if you have any questions.

939
00:59:25,375 --> 00:59:26,751
-I'm busy.
-Yes. Thank you.

940
00:59:31,089 --> 00:59:34,509
His brother died from a hit-and-run,
and his nephew died in an accident.

941
00:59:36,094 --> 00:59:37,303
What happened to this family?

942
00:59:47,438 --> 00:59:48,356
So Lee Gon

943
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:50,066
was here too.

944
00:59:55,405 --> 00:59:58,074
MR. JO EUN-SUP,
THANK YOU FOR USING OUR HOTEL

945
01:00:15,299 --> 01:00:16,634
I finished the security check.

946
01:00:21,014 --> 01:00:22,515
You haven't checked your expression.

947
01:00:23,766 --> 01:00:25,351
We're going to stay here for a while.

948
01:00:25,852 --> 01:00:27,729
I brought plenty of gold this time.

949
01:00:29,397 --> 01:00:30,273
Your Majesty.

950
01:00:32,108 --> 01:00:33,818
You must return to the palace.

951
01:00:34,444 --> 01:00:36,529
I can't protect you here, Your Majesty.

952
01:00:36,612 --> 01:00:39,449
What is this place, and how long
have you been coming here?

953
01:00:40,033 --> 01:00:41,200
You Majesty,

954
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:44,579
we don't have a life here.

955
01:00:46,539 --> 01:00:47,790
You've endured a lot,

956
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:50,126
Captain Jo.

957
01:00:53,546 --> 01:00:54,380
Yeong.

958
01:00:55,465 --> 01:00:57,050
I can't leave the palace permanently

959
01:00:57,717 --> 01:00:59,218
or give up coming here altogether.

960
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:01,888
So you have to help me.

961
01:01:02,472 --> 01:01:04,182
I'm going to go back Thursday evening,

962
01:01:04,807 --> 01:01:06,559
but I'm going to leave you here.

963
01:01:07,101 --> 01:01:09,854
-That is why I brought you with me.
-You're talking nonsense right now.

964
01:01:11,522 --> 01:01:12,607
One more person

965
01:01:14,192 --> 01:01:16,027
who doesn't belong here
has been added to this world.

966
01:01:19,447 --> 01:01:24,160
There's a chance that the traitor Lee Lim
is still alive.

967
01:01:26,621 --> 01:01:27,538
What...

968
01:01:29,123 --> 01:01:30,291
do you mean?

969
01:01:30,374 --> 01:01:34,796
You and Eun-sup, Tae-eul and Luna.
The same faces.

970
01:01:36,047 --> 01:01:37,465
Don't you get it?

971
01:01:41,886 --> 01:01:44,055
Let's say your theory is correct.

972
01:01:44,806 --> 01:01:46,140
What if he's in our world?

973
01:01:46,224 --> 01:01:48,935
In our world, there are enough reasons
and people

974
01:01:50,103 --> 01:01:50,978
to kill him.

975
01:01:53,481 --> 01:01:56,109
But there aren't any here. Only you.

976
01:01:56,192 --> 01:01:57,151
But Your Majesty...

977
01:01:57,777 --> 01:01:59,487
MR. JO EUN-SUP,
THANK YOU FOR USING OUR HOTEL

978
01:02:14,919 --> 01:02:16,087
<i>This is the third time.</i>

979
01:02:17,338 --> 01:02:20,383
<i>This may be a rule, not a side effect.</i>

980
01:02:21,467 --> 01:02:22,510
<i>What rule is it?</i>

981
01:02:23,803 --> 01:02:25,054
<i>What do I know so far?</i>

982
01:02:26,931 --> 01:02:28,099
<i>The Manpasikjeok...</i>

983
01:02:29,225 --> 01:02:30,226
<i>Lee Lim...</i>

984
01:02:31,978 --> 01:02:32,854
<i>The bamboo forest...</i>

985
01:02:36,482 --> 01:02:37,859
<i>I have to block that forest.</i>

986
01:02:53,416 --> 01:02:55,293
My job is to protect you.

987
01:02:55,501 --> 01:02:56,627
Yeong.

988
01:02:57,253 --> 01:02:59,589
Lee Lim is going
back and forth just like me.

989
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:02,300
And I think time stops whenever he does.

990
01:03:02,466 --> 01:03:04,010
You stopped moving just a moment ago.

991
01:03:06,012 --> 01:03:07,346
I'm sure he already knows

992
01:03:08,556 --> 01:03:09,724
that I've left the palace.

993
01:03:11,851 --> 01:03:12,935
But I don't know

994
01:03:13,853 --> 01:03:15,855
if Lee Lim left here or came here.

995
01:03:17,607 --> 01:03:18,608
I have to go back

996
01:03:19,525 --> 01:03:20,693
and find that out.

997
01:03:21,736 --> 01:03:22,612
All right.

998
01:03:23,905 --> 01:03:25,489
I'll believe you, so prove it.

999
01:03:26,407 --> 01:03:27,867
Show me proof

1000
01:03:28,826 --> 01:03:29,827
that time stopped.

1001
01:03:30,828 --> 01:03:32,163
Check your left pocket.

1002
01:03:40,922 --> 01:03:41,756
IS THIS ENOUGH PROOF?

1003
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:42,924
Is this enough proof?

1004
01:03:46,385 --> 01:03:47,220
Yeong.

1005
01:03:48,054 --> 01:03:50,306
He and I each have
half of a certain object.

1006
01:03:50,973 --> 01:03:52,683
If I lose my half to him,

1007
01:03:53,893 --> 01:03:56,312
he'll be the only one who can open
the door between our worlds.

1008
01:03:56,771 --> 01:03:57,647
Then,

1009
01:03:59,315 --> 01:04:00,900
we'd lose our lives in our world as well.

1010
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:05,696
That's why

1011
01:04:08,324 --> 01:04:10,534
you must kill him as soon as you find him.

1012
01:04:14,956 --> 01:04:16,082
It's a King's Order.

1013
01:04:19,418 --> 01:04:20,378
<i>Captain Jo.</i>

1014
01:04:20,878 --> 01:04:22,964
<i>Your phone's off so I'm leaving a message.</i>

1015
01:04:24,215 --> 01:04:27,760
I found that woman called Luna
I told you about last time.

1016
01:04:28,886 --> 01:04:29,887
But the strange thing is,

1017
01:04:30,972 --> 01:04:32,515
the fingerprints you gave me last time

1018
01:04:33,557 --> 01:04:35,393
matched Luna's.

1019
01:04:36,269 --> 01:04:37,645
That's why I called you.

1020
01:04:38,646 --> 01:04:40,273
The funny thing is though...

1021
01:04:42,692 --> 01:04:44,735
She already got arrested for larceny,

1022
01:04:46,112 --> 01:04:48,155
so she was actually in jail.

0631 SPECIAL LARCENY

1024
01:04:59,959 --> 01:05:00,918
Prime Minister Koo.

1025
01:05:01,377 --> 01:05:02,461
Prime Minister Koo.

1026
01:05:03,629 --> 01:05:04,839
I'm off work.

1027
01:05:05,589 --> 01:05:07,174
This is nine-minute care.

1028
01:05:07,925 --> 01:05:09,593
Stretch your body for nine minutes.

1029
01:05:15,308 --> 01:05:19,437
Your face will literally light up once you
hear this while you are getting the care.

1030
01:05:20,396 --> 01:05:22,857
The Royal Court sent a set of fingerprints
to the forensics.

1031
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:25,401
And it turned out to be a woman.

1032
01:05:25,901 --> 01:05:27,611
But there is something weird about it.

1033
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:30,614
Her identity was unknown

1034
01:05:30,865 --> 01:05:33,242
until she was arrested...

1035
01:05:36,078 --> 01:05:37,621
Forget it. Give it to me.

What? This girl is an ex-convict?

1038
01:05:49,925 --> 01:05:52,053
And she went into prison
in that short period of time?

1039
01:05:52,636 --> 01:05:53,596
You know her?

1040
01:05:55,222 --> 01:05:56,057
Do I?

1041
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:58,017
It's scary if you do know her.

1042
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:00,269
She has a history of forgery, trespassing,
assault, theft, and so on.

1043
01:06:00,353 --> 01:06:01,228
She's unbelievable.

1044
01:06:01,354 --> 01:06:05,358
Another thing is, she'll be released soon
when she was locked up not long ago.

1045
01:06:05,941 --> 01:06:06,859
Released?

1046
01:06:07,318 --> 01:06:08,361
When?

<i>Who</i>

1057
01:06:58,911 --> 01:07:00,579
<i>is keeping the balance?</i>

1058
01:07:18,347 --> 01:07:20,683
Send things that need to be sent
and throw away useless ones.

1059
01:07:22,893 --> 01:07:24,770
There was somethings we received
from your home.

1060
01:07:25,646 --> 01:07:27,189
-From my mom's house?
-Yes.

FROM KIM SEONG-AE

1062
01:07:32,653 --> 01:07:33,571
You can head home now.

1063
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:35,406
All right.

1064
01:07:44,915 --> 01:07:45,958
"North Korea"?

1065
01:07:46,709 --> 01:07:49,295
Donald Trump is the US President?

1066

What is this?

1067
01:07:53,841 --> 01:07:56,051

Good to see you again.

We've met before, right?

1075
01:10:32,333 --> 01:10:34,126
<i>The very first time you came here...</i>

1076
01:10:34,209 --> 01:10:36,253
-Would you have fallen for me?
-It would've led me to fall for you.

1077
01:10:36,337 --> 01:10:38,964
<i>I'm going to kill that man over there.</i>

1078
01:10:39,048 --> 01:10:40,633
<i>You have to catch him.</i>

1079
01:10:41,216 --> 01:10:43,469
Get the money ready.
The bills with the King's face.

1080
01:10:43,594 --> 01:10:44,887
<i>What happened?</i>

1081
01:10:45,262 --> 01:10:47,431
<i>So he first killed himself
and then killed me.</i>

1082
01:10:47,514 --> 01:10:50,184
<i>You're a miracle to me.</i>

1083
01:10:50,267 --> 01:10:51,727
<i>I saw something weird on it.</i>

1084
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:54,813
<i>Jang Yeon-ji has two cell phones?</i>

1085
01:10:54,897 --> 01:10:56,899
<i>I can switch it off and on
whenever it's necessary.</i>

1086
01:10:56,982 --> 01:10:59,318
You must be one of those
who stood on my father's blood.

1087
01:10:59,401 --> 01:11:01,236
Will I be able to catch up with you?

1088
01:11:01,737 --> 01:11:03,489
Hands off unless you want to die.

1089
01:11:03,572 --> 01:11:05,658
<i>Do I exist in this world?</i>
