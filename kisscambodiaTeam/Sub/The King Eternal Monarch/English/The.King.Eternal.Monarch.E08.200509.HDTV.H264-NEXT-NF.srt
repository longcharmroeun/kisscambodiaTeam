I was planning on telling you
when I was sure,

8
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,487
but I think there is someone

9
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:30,656
with your face in my world.

10
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:33,784
<i>Same faces,</i>

11
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:35,286
<i>same ID card,</i>

<i>and parallel worlds.</i>

17
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:09,737
Your Highness,
that does not belong to this world.

18
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,114
Things have been entangled strangely.

19
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,659
I did not make this move.

20
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:18,120
That girl is very famous in this world.

21
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:19,705
Her name is Luna.

22
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:23,709
If you pay her, she finds people
and even steals things for you.

23
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,377
She does everything for money.

24
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,297
I need you to track down that famous girl
and bring her to me.

25
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:30,299
Yes, Your Highness.

26
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:33,135
Then...

27
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:37,556
will I be able to catch up with you?

<i>and the two worlds are getting mixed up...</i>

<i>At least at the moment
when I sensed the transcendental power</i>

32
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,027
<i>that was trying to restore balance...</i>

33
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:52,029
<i>I should've known</i>

34
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,114
<i>before we had to face this situation.</i>

35
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,577
<i>That it's something like fate,
so to speak.</i>

36
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:06,168
Goodness, it's good to see you.

37
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,756
We keep meeting
at unexpected places, right?

38
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,056
Hey, this was my last cigarette.

39
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,392
What are you going to do?

40
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,855
Look at you talking to me all casually
just because we've met once.

41
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:32,736
As the Prime Minister,
I think you should quit.

42
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:34,905
Take your campaigning elsewhere.

43
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,157
I didn't vote for you.

44
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,118
You said you were my fan.

45
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,580
Are you pretending we've never met
because now I know who you are?

46
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:44,999
Cut the crap.

47
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,543
I do not recall meeting you.

48
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,214
You're really something.

49
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:57,553
It is you.

50
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:58,679
At the KU Building.

51
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,098
The traveler.

52
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,058
Do you live in a fairy tale?

53
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,187
Is this your palace?

54
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,196
Ms. Civil Servant.

55
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:20,284
Those who talk to me
belong to one of these two categories.

56
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,704
They either stole something from me

57
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,332
or got something stolen by me.

58
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,544
It never ends well in either case.

59
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:33,422
Get out of my way.

60
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:39,887
You really don't know me?

61
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:48,604
If you touch me again,

62
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:51,190
I will punch you without a warning.

63
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,028
Does he know that you're an ex-con?

64
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,824
I'll also punch you if you keep asking me
these nonsensical questions.

65
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,872
So, you really

66
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,793
don't know me as well as him.

67
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:15,631
You're not that bitch I saw
in front of KU.

68
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,675
Do you have a twin sister?

69
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,345
Is that what they're saying?

70
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:26,016
You obviously have access to enough intel
to figure out my release date,

71
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,894
so it's possible that you know
more about me than I do.

72
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,647
Let me know if you find her.

73
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:33,774
I'm curious too.

74
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,855
Go tell your mom
that you want to leave at once.

75
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:19,820
I'm going to kill that man over there
in a bit.

76
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,448
I'm just waiting for you to leave.

77
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,324
Why?

78
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,540
I had to serve jail time
because he betrayed me,

79
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,375
but he's here

80
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,502
to stuff his face with ice cream.

81
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,425
Min-jae, let's go.

82
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:01,320
You...

83
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:03,822
What are you doing here?

84
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:05,824
How the hell did you get out?

85
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:26,512
You see,

86
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,182
do you know what's good
about having nothing?

87
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,101
I have nothing to lose.

88
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,689
You have a pretty wife

89
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,276
and an ugly son, who looks just like you.

90
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,612
Don't hurt the kid. Please.

91
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,532
I'll give you back your money.

92
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,408
All of it. I'm serious.

93
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,077
Why did a douchebag like you

94
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:55,290
even get married, knowing it'd be
nothing but your weakness? I don't get it.

95
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,460
The insurance payout of 20 million won
and the interest as well.

96
00:06:58,544 --> 00:06:59,795
I'll give it all back.

97
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:03,549
I must have lost my mind back then.

98
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,050
Please.

99
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,803
He's the apple of my eye.

100
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,680
Please don't hurt him.

101
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,473
The apple of your puny eye?

102
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:14,935
Get the money ready.

103
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,855
The bills with the King's face.

104
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:20,983
No funny business,

105
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,403
or your son will actually end up
in your eyes,

106
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:26,738
as ground-up flesh.

107
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:42,629
Detective?

108
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,632
Oh, hello.

109
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,428
I'm Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul
from Jongno Police Station.

110
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:52,973
I'm the admin manager here.

111
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,935
I heard you're looking for a patient
who was here in 1995.

112
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,356
Yes. He died here, at Yangsun Care Center.

113
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:02,900
His name is Lee Seong-jae.

114
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:07,237
All the records were handwritten in 1995.

115
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:08,739
They're all gone now.

116
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,617
And we've changed the system
three times since then.

117
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:15,120
The records we have at the moment
only date back to ten years ago.

118
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,124
Then do you know if any of your doctors,

119
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,543
nurses, or employees were here back then?

120
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,046
I've been here for 19 years.

121
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,549
Everyone who was here before me
is all retired now.

122
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:31,637
Except for me, I think the director
is the only one who was here back then.

123
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,556
Then may I meet the director?

124
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,266
The director would remember him.

125
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,768
He had poliomyelitis.

126
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,395
The director is rarely in Korea.

127
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,815
It's not like the director
has to treat patients.

128
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:44,942
And with all that wealth...

129
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,611
If this is regarding a criminal case,

130
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,863
you must've brought an official document
or a warrant.

131
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:50,989
What is this about?

132
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:57,037
I needed some information
for another case I'm working on.

133
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,288
Thank you for your help.

134
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,374
No problem.

135
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,842
Asking for a warrant first?

136
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,720
I can't tell if she's good at her job

137
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,139
or if she's done this many times before.

138
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:24,398
<i>The picture of Prime Minister Koo
and the King is the talk of the town.</i>

139
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,440
<i>That's right.</i>

140
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:29,736
<i>The media released a photo of them
whispering to each other at the racetrack.</i>

141
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,073
<i>Correct. People are saying they might be
seeing each other, and those in Yeouido</i>

142
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,325
<i>can't just brush it off
as a groundless rumor.</i>

143
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:38,662
<i>Right, Prime Minister Koo
has quite a background.</i>

144
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,247
<i>She's definitely been on an elite path.</i>

145
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:43,291
<i>She went to Seojin International
High School and Corea University.</i>

146
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,836
<i>Then she joined a public channel
as an announcer</i>

147
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,089
<i>and worked her way up to becoming
the main news anchor in just four years.</i>

148
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:53,051
<i>Then she surprised everyone by marrying
the second son of the KU family.</i>

149
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:56,096
<i>My gosh. She surprised us once again
shortly after that.</i>

150
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,765
<i>She got a divorce in the same year.</i>

151
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,476
<i>That's right.
Scandals follow her everywhere she goes.</i>

152
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:05,230
<i>After her divorce, she got into politics.</i>

153
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,691
-She became Prime Minister in seven years.
-<i>Then she became Prime Minister</i>

154
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,067
<i>in just seven years.</i>

155
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:12,070
-<i>My gosh, it sounds like a movie.</i>
-It sounds like a movie.

156
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,120
Mommy will take you to somewhere nice.

157
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,416
Sa-rang, you now have an aunt.

158
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,087
A prime minister aunt.

159
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,052
It's nice to meet you.

160
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:38,013
I'm a big fan.

161
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:39,848
Hey, this was my last cigarette.

162
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,017
What are you going to do?

163
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:45,353
Jeez, what's the deal
with that crazy bitch?

164
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,358
MOM

165
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:51,860
Hi, Mom.

166
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,946
I'm surprised you picked up right away.

167
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,032
Everything's good, right?

168
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,618
Things can't be good all the time.

169
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,287
I won't get paid
if everything is always peaceful.

170
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:03,955
What's up?

171
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:05,791
I just wanted to call you.

172
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,544
I had a really weird dream last night.

173
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:14,257
I know you rarely drive yourself,
but drive safely if you do.

174
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,676
And be careful not to lose anything.

175
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,763
You always have the weirdest dreams, Mom.

176
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,265
Don't worry.

177
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,351
I'd never let anyone
take anything from me.

178
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:29,606
Oh, right.
Mom, what's the newspaper you sent me?

179
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,565
Newspaper?

180
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,150
What newspaper?

181
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,236
I didn't send anything like that.

182
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:35,987
You got something?

183
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,074
I'll call you later. I have a customer.

184
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,534
All right.

185
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:43,745
Hello.

186
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:50,043
What would you like? The mackerel
and Pacific saury are both very fresh.

187
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,671
I left my umbrella here a long time ago.

188
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,048
Do you still have it?

189
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:58,426
Yes.

190
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,054
I had a feeling you'd come back for it,
so I kept it.

191
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,474
That's why you looked familiar.

192
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,726
I thought I had seen you somewhere before.

193
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,728
Just a moment, please.

194
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:39,759
You got out pretty quickly.

195
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:41,720
And your style has changed.

196
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,873
I just grabbed a random jacket I found
on the run.

197
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,042
It's getting cold.

198
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,127
Put it on or you'll freeze to death.

199
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,254
Then why do you live in a van?

200
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,633
You steal stuff every day,
and you're still broke?

201
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,468
No, I have a lot of money.

202
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,929
But I also have a lot of enemies.

203
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,850
It's a world you don't need to know about.

204
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,042
Leave it anywhere there.

205
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,668
Thank you.

206
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:01,508
Thank you for this.

207
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:05,595
It's hot chocolate.

208
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,555
I heard you like sweets.

209
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,768
Chief Park mentions it
every time he drinks.

210
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:18,692
"Sin-jae loves sweets,
and Tae-eul is a meat lover.

211
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:22,237
Detective Shim loves <i>makgeolli</i>."

212
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,490
I heard the newbie likes macarons.

213
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,741
Macarons?

214
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,201
That's crazy.

215
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:33,707
Here are Ha Eun-mi's autopsy results.

216
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,751
You're lucky that you know me.

217
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:38,837
Thank you.

218
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:40,297
Sure.

219
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,341
I'm sure you saw it at the scene.

220
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,552
She died from exsanguination
from the two neck wounds.

221
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,430
A small amount of zolpidem
was found in her blood,

222
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:51,057
which explains
why there are no defense wounds.

223
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:54,686
I was suspecting her boyfriend
because of the security footage,

224
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,022
but I should reinvestigate her roommate.

225
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:57,981
Yes, I agree.

226
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,318
I've also been suspicious
of my roommate as of late.

227
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,111
Detective Kang, it's not you, right?

228
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:07,532
-Sorry?
-The one who keeps calling my hubby out.

229
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:12,787
You're his alibi, but I'm debating
whether or not I should look into it.

230
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,080
What should I do?

231
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,459
It is me.

232
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,586
-I did--
-Okay.

233
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:21,713
-Get going.
-Okay.

234
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,053
Nice catch.

235
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:34,434
What do the results say?

236
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,770
You've been taking off often.

237
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,104
Are you receiving bribes?

238
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,029
It's too bad that such a fine tradition
is disappearing these days.

239
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,909
A small amount of zolpidem was found.

240
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,494
She was sedated, then stabbed.

241
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:58,083
Then maybe it wasn't Park Jung-gu.
He fed her, sedated her,

242
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,417
stabbed her, and ran?

243
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:00,960
He didn't have enough time.

244
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,797
It was Jang Yeon-ji, then.

245
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,553
Even if we arrest her,
we'll only have 48 hours.

246
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:14,140
Go through her medical records and find
solid evidence to get her locked up.

247
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,893
First, remove the boyfriend
from the suspect list.

248
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,019
Then what should you do?

249
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,604
Arrest him first, right?

250
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:20,897
Good luck.

251
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,817
Jangmi and I switched our stakeout shifts.

252
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:25,860
Why?

253
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:28,113
Why are you taking off?

254
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:35,245
How can we help you?

255
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:37,497
I'm here for Min Hwa-yeon.

256
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:42,627
Are you her son?

257
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,379
All right, have a seat.

258
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,260
I need your signature here.

259
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:52,512
I'm sure you know the drill.

260
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,558
Your mother said you're a cop.

261
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:57,892
AFFIDAVIT OF IDENTITY

262
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,524
Lieutenant Kang Sin-jae,
Jongno Police Station.

263
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,192
So it's true.

264
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:07,944
I thought she was bullshitting.

265
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,239
I'm sure you know
this isn't her first time.

266
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:13,032
Yes, I heard.

267
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,492
We let her go every single time.

268
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,036
Gosh, I can't believe she's here again.

269
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,832
Next time, we won't let her go so easily.

270
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,885
AFFIANT KANG SIN-JAE

271
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,344
BUDAEJJIGAE

272
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,847
In this world,
there's a dish called <i>budaejjigae</i>.

273
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,433
I heard it was invented
during the Korean War.

274
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:42,103
It's interesting.
Both this and "half and half"

275
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:45,899
This is the place.

276
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,322
Look who's here.

277
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:56,367
Of course, I'd run into my enemy
in front of an amazing restaurant.

278
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,786
Last time, there were three of you.

279
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,540
I'm still all swollen
from getting beaten up to a pulp that day.

280
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,959
How come it's just the two of you today?

281
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,961
I have seven men today.

282
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,215
I guess I won't be able to
try this stew today.

283
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:12,759
I have Yeong today.

284
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:15,053
Yeong.

285
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,679
Don't kill them.

286
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,306
They're ordinary civilians.

287
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:19,599
Oh, boy.

288
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:24,103
I didn't expect something like this
would happen.

289
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:26,481
What?

290
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:29,692
When did you switch places?

291
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:32,987
Where's my Unbreakable Sword?

292
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,075
He told me
to just stay quiet and eat with you.

293
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:39,661
What the heck is going on?

294
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,290
Stand behind me.

295
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,376
Go hide somewhere if you can.

296
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:48,503
Yeong will show up--

297
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:49,546
Good luck!

298
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:52,715
Is that punk running away?

299
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,885
Goodness, your teamwork sucks.

300
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,263
Well, are you going to be okay?

301
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,014
For now, I'm here alone.

302
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,600
Will eight of you be enough?

303
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,147
Boys, do him in good.

304
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,316
Let's get even.

305
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:18,241
God.

306
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:19,784
I have to tell Tae-eul.

307
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:21,661
Gosh!

308
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:30,753
Wow.

309
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,224
Thank you. The food was great.

310
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:44,642
Thank you.

311
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,314
Gosh, jeez.

312
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:50,857
-Are they fighting?
-Goodness.

313
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,108
Jeez, idiots.

314
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:57,530
What the...

315
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:58,865
Hey.

316
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:02,285
That cool-looking dude
can't be Eun-sup, right?

317
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:06,581
Guys! Stop.

318
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:07,940
Stop.

319
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:12,295
What the hell are you guys doing
on the roadside in broad daylight?

320
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,963
Guys, run!

321
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,551
I said, stop.

322
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:19,969
PARK MUN-SIK
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

323
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,346
JEONG TAE-EUL
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

324
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,557
Are you doing military duties right now?

325
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:25,642
Yes.

326
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:27,852
Hey.

327
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,228
I'll handle the rest.

328
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:34,442
Eun-sup, you totally surprised us.

329
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,861
You were like a ninja.
Have you been working out?

330
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:45,286
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

331
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,164
I didn't want you to see this. Jeez.

332
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,624
It was no biggie.

333
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,043
These guys were bullying a passerby,

334
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,211
so I taught them a lesson.

335
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,089
You guys are so screwed now.

336
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:59,008
Look, I'm the one
who should be calling the cops.

337
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:00,677
I mean, you beat me up.

338
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:04,305
There's something weird about him.
I clearly saw him running away earlier.

339
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:05,765
I see. You saw him running away,

340
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:09,143
but you mobilized your boys
and got caught.

341
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,604
Therefore, you must come
to the police station with us

342
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:13,815
and fill out the statement form, okay?

343
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,070
Hang on. Who's that guy by the way?
How come he keeps staring at Eun-sup?

344
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:23,658
I should've introduced myself. I am--

345
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:24,992
Shut it, dude.

346
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,745
The elders are talking.
Don't you dare cut in.

347
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,082
He's my friend from Busan.

348
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,001
It's his first time in Seoul,
so this fool can't do anything.

349
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,253
He can't even eat without me.

350
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:36,629
You guys haven't eaten yet?

351
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:37,839
Hey, go eat something.

352
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,799
And I'll need a statement
from you as well.

353
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,175
Yes, sir.

354
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:45,847
Dude, come on!

355
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,308
Watch where you're going.
Your legs are long but useless.

356
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,519
That nutjob.

357
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,396
Nice to meet you, buddy. Enjoy your lunch!

358
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:56,983
I'm sure that's not the guy I saw earlier.

359
00:21:57,567 --> 00:22:01,195
That lanky prick said he came alone,
but there are five of you in total.

360
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,114
What? Are you a rapper or what?

361
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:04,240
Come on, yo.

362
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:10,621
-Eun-sup.
-It's me, Yeong.

363
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:12,540
No, you are Eun-sup.

364
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:13,666
You were Eun-sup earlier.

365
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:16,419
Yeong would never...

366
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:19,464
He'd never call me a fool.

367
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:20,923
Yeong knows

368
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,550
what I use my long legs for.

369
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,470
I apologize. I tend to improvise
in emergency situations.

370
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:26,721
So, you are Yeong?

371
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:27,763
Yes, Your Majesty.

372
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,974
Then you will be beheaded
according to the law.

373
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:31,642
Maybe I'm Eun-sup, then.

374
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:34,228
Eun-sup will also be beheaded
according to the Foreigners Act.

375
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:39,275
However,

376
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:43,279
I wish to be a wise and merciful king.

377
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:45,865
I shall have mercy on you.

378
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,412
Come here.

379
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,878
Don't forget.

380
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,422
You will be beheaded
if you remove this mole.

381
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,635
Thank you for your boundless mercy.

382
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:08,012
Sure thing.

383
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:15,061
It's me.

384
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:16,729
<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

385
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:18,564
<i>What's up?</i>

386
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,900
You told me to call you
when I'm on the move.

387
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:24,028
I called you because
I'm rushing to go somewhere now.

388
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,905
-<i>Where are you going?</i>
-To the living room.

389
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,451
Eun-sup's place can't be that big.

390
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,538
<i>I moved to a hotel.</i>

391
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:36,040
<i>Eun-sup's siblings
have gone back to school.</i>

392
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,668
<i>Now, I'm headed to the fridge
from the living room.</i>

393
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,336
<i>It's time for some coffee.</i>

394
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:44,048
The fridge? You should've called me
when you were leaving his place

395
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:45,716
to go to the hotel.

396
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:49,804
What?

397
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:51,138
What happened?

398
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,141
<i>Hello? What's wrong? Did you get hurt?</i>

399
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:56,686
It's not that. I'm just surprised.

400
00:23:57,728 --> 00:24:00,773
The coffee Yeong got tastes just like
the coffee I drink at the palace.

401
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:04,235
Rich and flavorful at the beginning
and clean at the end.

402
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,988
This is sold in stores here?

403
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,823
Are you kidding me?

404
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:13,244
I think I know which hotel it is.
I'm in the area now.

405
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:15,788
I'll give you ten minutes.
Come down right now.

406
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:20,793
So my theory was right.

407
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:24,714
I have to irritate her to see her.

408
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,845
She'll say she has to leave quickly.

409
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:32,888
I'd say about 20 minutes?

410
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:34,599
I'm saying, don't follow me.

411
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:09,884
Eight minutes and forty seconds.

412
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:12,928
I came down right away.

413
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:16,807
-Yeong wanted to follow me, so I--
-The very first time you came here...

414
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,769
Would you still have fallen for me

415
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:22,021
even if I had never helped you?

416
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:27,193
I would've understood.

417
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:30,571
And that understanding

418
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,782
would've led me to fall for you.

419
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,785
What if I was super rude to you?
Still the same answer?

420
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:36,994
You were super rude.

421
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,957
Yes, still the same answer.

422
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:46,337
Why?

423
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,131
Because you must've had your reason.

424
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:56,305
<i>It took me a long time to realize this.</i>

425
00:25:57,682 --> 00:25:58,599
<i>When it's fate,</i>

426
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,518
<i>there are no coincidences.</i>

427
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,271
<i>Your fate is determined
by the choices you make,</i>

428
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:06,440
<i>but there are times</i>

429
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:10,277
<i>when your fate chooses you.</i>

430
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:12,446
Why do you ask?

431
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,533
In the beginning,
you have to ask about everything.

432
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,368
We just skipped too many things.

433
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,830
I have to go on a stakeout.

434
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:22,832
I got to see you, so I'm off.

435
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,166
Did something happen?

436
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:28,462
No, not at all.

437
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:29,922
It's been a quiet,

438
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,674
peaceful day.

439
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:35,594
This is probably the most eventful moment
of the day.

440
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:38,264
You came to see me

441
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,391
despite the traffic jam.

442
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,601
I haven't eaten yet, so I'm irritable now.

443
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,563
I'm adding 1 more into the 17 rules.

444
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:47,940
No cheesy comments when I'm hungry.

445
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,026
Anyway, I'm glad everything is good.
I'm off.

446
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:55,489
<i>Things that are bound to happen</i>

447
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,868
<i>are taking place even at this moment.</i>

448
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:03,789
<i>I was struck with a sad premonition
that this will be short-lived,</i>

449
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:08,586
<i>but I decided to love my fate</i>

450
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:10,880
<i>that chose me.</i>

451
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:12,298
I love you.

452
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:22,266
Yeong is in the hotel room, right?

453
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,350
Hang on.

454
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,439
I'm still

455
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,900
mesmerized by what you said earlier.

456
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,115
Yeong went out.

457
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:39,992
He just walked by. Didn't you see him?

458
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,744
He has to... No.

459
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:43,829
That's not important.

460
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:47,208
I mean,

461
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,294
you just said--

462
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,504
I told you he can't go out.

463
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:53,047
Find him and go back in.

464
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:56,383
Jeong Tae-eul.

465
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,012
Ditto.

466
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:22,368
You obviously heard what I said.

467
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:29,750
Don't worry about Yeong.

468
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,504
He's done it once,
so he won't get busted again.

469
00:28:43,025 --> 00:28:43,901
Hey, Jo Eun-sup!

470
00:28:45,611 --> 00:28:46,612
<i>I'm in trouble.</i>

471
00:28:46,946 --> 00:28:48,030
<i>A female voice.</i>

472
00:28:55,872 --> 00:28:58,166
Don't you dare run away.
You were about to sprint!

473
00:29:01,377 --> 00:29:02,920
<i>She looks like Myeong Seung-a.</i>

474
00:29:03,504 --> 00:29:05,089
<i>I wonder who that woman is.</i>

475
00:29:05,423 --> 00:29:08,342
What the heck? Shouldn't you be
at the police station now?

476
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,138
Hold on, you're wearing...

477
00:29:13,598 --> 00:29:14,640
Did you have a blind date?

478
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:18,186
I'm sorry.

479
00:29:19,228 --> 00:29:20,396
Were you at a funeral?

480
00:29:22,315 --> 00:29:23,274
You got your hair done.

481
00:29:25,026 --> 00:29:26,694
<i>I can't draw any more attention.</i>

482
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,078
Are you calling me over?

483
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,122
With your finger?

484
00:29:39,207 --> 00:29:40,458
Jeez, has he lost his mind?

485
00:29:46,339 --> 00:29:47,965
It'd better be about something important!

486
00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:51,385
<i>She's tough.</i>

487
00:29:52,178 --> 00:29:53,429
<i>Then there's only one way.</i>

488
00:30:01,896 --> 00:30:03,272
I'm curious about something.

489
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,403
Do I have a crush on you?

490
00:30:09,695 --> 00:30:11,113
Or is it the other way around?

491
00:30:12,365 --> 00:30:13,366
I mean, in this world.

492
00:30:17,245 --> 00:30:18,996
This is why you don't have a girlfriend.

493
00:30:19,413 --> 00:30:20,456
Cut it out.

494
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,875
What's that on your face? Seaweed?

495
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:23,793
Don't touch it, or...

496
00:30:24,752 --> 00:30:26,754
Or what? Try causing trouble.

497
00:30:26,963 --> 00:30:28,673
I made <i>japchae</i>, so pick it up later.

498
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,518
Gosh, that guy can fight.

499
00:30:40,601 --> 00:30:42,728
I'm a pretty good fighter too.

500
00:30:49,652 --> 00:30:52,530
Jeez, you scared the crap out of me.
What do you want from me?

501
00:30:52,613 --> 00:30:54,907
Hey, Tae-eul said
that you can only go out at night--

502
00:30:54,991 --> 00:30:57,410
Who is this woman?
She's kind of pretty and...

503
00:30:57,493 --> 00:30:59,537
Jo Yeong. You're really him.
This is unbelievable.

504
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,247
-She has pretty eyes.
-Na-ri.

505
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,082
-She drives a supercar.
-Myeong Na-ri.

506
00:31:04,292 --> 00:31:05,835
Hey, did you meet Na-ri?

507
00:31:06,252 --> 00:31:08,296
What did she say?
Tell me everything she said.

508
00:31:08,379 --> 00:31:09,964
She wants to get in trouble with you.

509
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:12,008
And told me to pick up <i>japchae</i>.

510
00:31:14,302 --> 00:31:16,971
<i>Japchae</i>? Get in trouble? With me?

511
00:31:18,764 --> 00:31:20,474
Can you elaborate?

512
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:22,268
What did you say
before the <i>japchae</i> comment?

513
00:31:22,351 --> 00:31:23,602
Why would she give me <i>japchae</i>?

514
00:31:23,686 --> 00:31:25,813
-Do you have a crush on her?
-Who wouldn't?

515
00:31:28,232 --> 00:31:30,776
Anyway, I can't go now.

516
00:31:31,277 --> 00:31:33,654
Call her and tell her
that I'll stop by another time.

517
00:31:33,738 --> 00:31:34,864
I need to calm down first.

518
00:31:35,865 --> 00:31:37,908
Na-ri and I? Our first <i>japchae</i> together?

519
00:31:39,035 --> 00:31:39,952
Loser.

520
00:31:40,161 --> 00:31:42,371
How much time do you need?
Would ten minutes be enough?

521
00:31:43,748 --> 00:31:44,749
A hundred years!

522
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:46,042
Loser.

523
00:31:55,843 --> 00:31:56,802
Tae-eul, you're here.

524
00:31:56,886 --> 00:31:58,220
Hey, any leads?

525
00:31:59,805 --> 00:32:00,681
So far, nothing.

526
00:32:05,728 --> 00:32:06,562
It's so refreshing.

527
00:32:07,146 --> 00:32:08,481
You know your kimchi, Jangmi.

528
00:32:13,361 --> 00:32:14,403
What is all that?

529
00:32:15,738 --> 00:32:18,366
Detective Shim said I'd need
a lot of things for my first stakeout.

530
00:32:19,784 --> 00:32:20,743
Are you going camping?

531
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:26,123
By the way, what's going on with Sin-jae?

532
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,375
Why did he switch with you?

533
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:29,085
I didn't ask.

534
00:32:30,252 --> 00:32:31,962
I wouldn't have to ask

535
00:32:32,046 --> 00:32:33,964
if he was going to tell me.

536
00:32:35,966 --> 00:32:38,886
Impressive.
That's why I didn't ask him either.

537
00:32:45,351 --> 00:32:46,227
What?

538
00:32:47,144 --> 00:32:50,064
Are you amazed by how wise I am?

539
00:32:50,147 --> 00:32:51,190
No, it's not that.

540
00:32:51,482 --> 00:32:54,902
What is that little gadget?
You can use it for your lips and face?

541
00:32:57,696 --> 00:32:59,615
The old sayings are always so true.

542
00:33:00,741 --> 00:33:03,411
You can't even use multi-purpose balm
in front of kids.

543
00:33:04,286 --> 00:33:05,162
You can have it.

544
00:33:05,246 --> 00:33:06,539
This is the be-all and end-all.

545
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:09,750
Thank you.

546
00:33:10,668 --> 00:33:11,502
Oh, my.

547
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,132
Are we sure Park Jung-gu isn't home yet?

548
00:33:16,715 --> 00:33:18,134
Yes, I checked.

549
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:19,677
Okay.

550
00:33:20,344 --> 00:33:21,220
Oh, nice.

551
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:24,682
About the victim...

552
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:29,687
She probably never even imagined
she'd die like that, right?

553
00:33:33,858 --> 00:33:34,733
Jangmi.

554
00:33:35,901 --> 00:33:37,695
It's your first time
at a murder scene, right?

555
00:33:38,988 --> 00:33:39,822
Yes.

556
00:33:40,406 --> 00:33:42,116
Did you know that many cops
commit suicide?

557
00:33:42,741 --> 00:33:43,617
What?

558
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:46,412
You'll see countless more cases like this
going forward.

559
00:33:47,288 --> 00:33:48,205
Remember, work is work.

560
00:33:49,373 --> 00:33:51,417
We must do our best
to investigate every case.

561
00:33:52,251 --> 00:33:56,547
When the case is closed, we have to do
our best to forget about it and move on,

562
00:33:57,256 --> 00:33:58,716
or you can't do this for a long time.

563
00:34:00,718 --> 00:34:01,594
Okay.

564
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,515
What do we need to do to close this case?

565
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:09,018
We should catch the killer, right?

566
00:34:10,102 --> 00:34:12,021
-Yes.
-Keep your eyes peeled.

567
00:34:13,105 --> 00:34:14,231
I'll have my eyes peeled.

568
00:34:17,818 --> 00:34:19,737
Park Jung-gu, spotted.

569
00:34:20,571 --> 00:34:21,947
Jangmi, let's go!

570
00:34:24,992 --> 00:34:25,868
Mr. Park Jung-gu?

571
00:34:25,951 --> 00:34:27,119
Damn it!

572
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:36,504
My gosh.

573
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:44,845
Tae-eul! I caught him.

574
00:34:48,724 --> 00:34:50,476
I think I caught the suspect.

575
00:34:51,477 --> 00:34:52,353
All right.

576
00:34:56,106 --> 00:34:58,776
But he doesn't seem to be breathing.

577
00:34:59,985 --> 00:35:02,530
Hey, no.
We don't have an extra set of handcuffs.

578
00:35:05,324 --> 00:35:06,534
Mr. Park Jung-gu.

579
00:35:07,576 --> 00:35:08,869
Wake up.

580
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,663
<i>Jangmi caught Park Jung-gu.</i>

581
00:35:11,872 --> 00:35:13,874
Mr. Park.

582
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:15,626
<i>I just got home.</i>

583
00:35:16,377 --> 00:35:18,087
<i>I'll be there fairly soon.</i>

584
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:20,381
Tae-eul, he's not breathing...

585
00:35:20,464 --> 00:35:21,757
What do I do?

586
00:35:22,299 --> 00:35:25,219
<i>Sin-jae, don't pretend
you haven't seen my message.</i>

587
00:35:25,594 --> 00:35:26,428
Mr. Park!

588
00:35:43,237 --> 00:35:44,488
This restaurant is busy.

589
00:35:47,241 --> 00:35:48,075
Mom.

590
00:35:50,369 --> 00:35:51,579
Is it that fun?

591
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:57,001
I'm sorry.

592
00:35:58,669 --> 00:36:00,129
I promise I won't do it again.

593
00:36:01,755 --> 00:36:04,425
When I'm sitting there,
I feel like everything's going to go well.

594
00:36:05,259 --> 00:36:08,137
And it helps me get my mind off things.

595
00:36:10,681 --> 00:36:13,892
I'm broke now,
so I can't even wager large amounts.

596
00:36:17,229 --> 00:36:19,523
You were ill for a long time, you know.

597
00:36:21,442 --> 00:36:22,943
When you regained your consciousness,

598
00:36:23,736 --> 00:36:25,571
I felt like the whole world was mine.

599
00:36:25,863 --> 00:36:29,033
I thought only happiness awaited us.
But then, that thing happened to your dad.

600
00:36:29,617 --> 00:36:31,619
And I just couldn't pull myself together.

601
00:36:34,538 --> 00:36:35,497
How's Dad?

602
00:36:36,915 --> 00:36:38,208
Is he doing all right?

603
00:36:39,168 --> 00:36:40,336
Well, you know.

604
00:36:43,964 --> 00:36:45,299
He told me that you've been

605
00:36:46,258 --> 00:36:48,344
sending money monthly
to his inmate account.

606
00:36:51,472 --> 00:36:52,306
Mom.

607
00:36:54,141 --> 00:36:55,893
Were you happy when I woke up?

608
00:36:55,976 --> 00:36:57,728
Gosh, of course.

609
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,521
Your dad and I thought we'd lose you.

610
00:36:59,647 --> 00:37:02,566
That one year when you were in a coma
was hell for us.

611
00:37:03,317 --> 00:37:06,820
Gosh, thinking about that time
still makes my heart pound.

612
00:37:10,574 --> 00:37:11,575
I felt the same way.

613
00:37:14,161 --> 00:37:15,245
When I woke up,

614
00:37:16,955 --> 00:37:18,374
you held me in your arms.

615
00:37:21,126 --> 00:37:23,170
And you smelled so nice.

616
00:37:26,298 --> 00:37:27,508
That was when I first realized

617
00:37:29,301 --> 00:37:30,511
that a person

618
00:37:31,512 --> 00:37:33,013
could smell so good.

619
00:37:51,865 --> 00:37:52,700
Mom.

620
00:37:54,785 --> 00:37:55,661
You see,

621
00:37:58,706 --> 00:38:02,292
I was always so happy to be your son.

622
00:38:12,428 --> 00:38:13,595
<i>I know that I wasn't</i>

623
00:38:15,055 --> 00:38:16,598
<i>always a good son to you.</i>

624
00:38:20,602 --> 00:38:21,937
I called the cops on you...

625
00:38:26,775 --> 00:38:28,026
I'm really sorry, Mom.

626
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,321
So please.

627
00:38:33,991 --> 00:38:36,201
Do not ruin yourself anymore, please.

628
00:38:37,494 --> 00:38:39,204
I'm sorry for everything.

629
00:38:41,957 --> 00:38:44,877
I should've stayed away from gambling
no matter how stressed out I was.

630
00:38:48,756 --> 00:38:50,257
I'm sorry for everything, my dear son.

631
00:38:53,677 --> 00:38:54,511
I'm

632
00:38:56,847 --> 00:38:58,307
incompetent and pathetic,

633
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:00,267
so I feel bad saying this to you, but...

634
00:39:04,688 --> 00:39:05,731
Kang Sin-jae.

635
00:39:06,899 --> 00:39:07,775
You're

636
00:39:09,318 --> 00:39:11,737
a miracle to me.

637
00:39:27,294 --> 00:39:28,170
Eat up.

638
00:41:06,101 --> 00:41:07,436
SEOUL JONGNO POLICE STATION

639
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:08,812
<i>It wasn't me.</i>

640
00:41:08,896 --> 00:41:10,564
Why would I kill her?

641
00:41:11,148 --> 00:41:13,025
When I got there, she was already dead.

642
00:41:13,317 --> 00:41:16,528
The blood got on me because I freaked out
and touched her to see if she was alive.

643
00:41:16,612 --> 00:41:17,821
I see.

644
00:41:17,905 --> 00:41:20,824
I was going to wash up at my buddy's place
in the area, and then call.

645
00:41:20,908 --> 00:41:22,743
-But you didn't.
-Exactly.

646
00:41:22,868 --> 00:41:24,328
You've never been in that situation.

647
00:41:25,162 --> 00:41:27,205
I'm telling you. Your mind goes numb.

648
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:30,000
We went through your texts.
You owed her five million won.

649
00:41:31,668 --> 00:41:34,421
Maybe you killed her
so that you wouldn't have to pay her back.

650
00:41:34,504 --> 00:41:36,256
Jeez, this is driving me nuts.

651
00:41:37,382 --> 00:41:40,385
I called her because of that message,
but she didn't pick up.

652
00:41:40,469 --> 00:41:41,637
That's why I went there.

653
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,097
Eun-mi didn't have five million won
to lend to me.

654
00:41:44,306 --> 00:41:46,266
She couldn't even pay
her credit card bills.

655
00:41:48,268 --> 00:41:50,145
Jeez, this is nuts.

656
00:41:53,148 --> 00:41:56,068
Jang Yeon-ji is now our key suspect.
Let's try to track her down.

657
00:41:56,276 --> 00:41:58,820
We can only keep her for 48 hours
even if we manage to get her.

658
00:41:59,404 --> 00:42:00,906
We don't have any decisive evidence.

659
00:42:01,114 --> 00:42:02,574
I mean, do we have anything?

660
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:03,575
We might.

661
00:42:04,826 --> 00:42:06,662
I read a script Jang Yeon-ji was reading.

662
00:42:06,828 --> 00:42:08,997
It describes an MO
just like the one seen in this case.

663
00:42:09,915 --> 00:42:11,875
The killer burns the bloody clothes
on a rooftop.

664
00:42:12,542 --> 00:42:13,502
<i>It has a catchy title.</i>

665
00:42:14,211 --> 00:42:15,170
"The Desires of Magma."

666
00:42:15,253 --> 00:42:18,715
My, I'm already hooked.
I'm dying to find out what it's about.

667
00:42:19,091 --> 00:42:21,176
Hey, I think someone's phone is buzzing.

668
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,303
Oh, yes.

669
00:42:31,311 --> 00:42:32,145
It's Jang Yeon-ji.

670
00:42:33,146 --> 00:42:34,231
Answer it. Quick!

671
00:42:37,526 --> 00:42:39,152
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul speaking.

672
00:42:45,826 --> 00:42:46,785
Jang Yeon-ji

673
00:42:47,411 --> 00:42:48,412
wants to turn herself in.

674
00:42:49,037 --> 00:42:50,122
Gosh.

675
00:42:55,335 --> 00:42:57,838
Everything is clear. You can go in now.

676
00:42:59,089 --> 00:43:01,049
I finally get to try this stew.

677
00:43:10,809 --> 00:43:11,852
Are you ready to order?

678
00:43:12,644 --> 00:43:14,604
Min-hui, clean Table Three first.

679
00:43:16,606 --> 00:43:17,858
Fill up the water bottle and...

680
00:43:18,358 --> 00:43:19,526
Your...

681
00:43:31,872 --> 00:43:32,706
I suppose

682
00:43:34,332 --> 00:43:36,460
I'll never get to taste this stew.

683
00:43:37,878 --> 00:43:38,754
Yeong.

684
00:43:39,671 --> 00:43:41,298
We need to get out of here.

685
00:43:41,882 --> 00:43:42,966
What's the matter?

686
00:43:44,176 --> 00:43:48,388
The owner of that restaurant
recognized me. And you too.

687
00:43:49,806 --> 00:43:52,017
But how could someone in this world
recognize--

688
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,810
It means he doesn't belong to this world.

689
00:43:55,062 --> 00:43:57,564
If he flees,
it means that he recognized us.

690
00:43:57,647 --> 00:43:58,982
And if that happens,

691
00:44:00,692 --> 00:44:02,152
you have to catch him.

692
00:44:02,235 --> 00:44:03,278
At all costs.

693
00:44:04,488 --> 00:44:05,781
Don't worry about me.

694
00:44:07,407 --> 00:44:08,492
Yes, Your Majesty.

695
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:18,293
The five people who will help me

696
00:44:19,669 --> 00:44:20,962
regardless of what...

697
00:45:18,854 --> 00:45:22,023
CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY
AND THE ROYAL FAMILY

698
00:45:26,862 --> 00:45:28,405
PRINCE IMPERIAL GEUM
LEE LIM

699
00:45:28,488 --> 00:45:30,490
I left my umbrella here a long time ago.

700
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:32,284
<i>Do you still have it?</i>

701
00:45:39,124 --> 00:45:40,125
Your clothes, right?

702
00:45:40,584 --> 00:45:42,878
We found the victim's blood on it.

703
00:45:43,378 --> 00:45:45,964
And we found your fingerprints
on the steel trash can.

704
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,842
Why did you kill your roommate?

705
00:45:50,427 --> 00:45:51,887
I just couldn't stand her.

706
00:45:53,763 --> 00:45:55,640
Why did you message Park Jung-gu?

707
00:45:57,309 --> 00:45:58,810
I couldn't stand him either.

708
00:46:01,313 --> 00:46:02,814
So you confessed to everything.

709
00:46:03,523 --> 00:46:06,151
Jang Yeon-ji, you're under arrest
for the murder of Ha Eun-mi.

710
00:46:13,366 --> 00:46:16,286
<i>You see, that girl always
gave me the creeps.</i>

711
00:46:17,287 --> 00:46:19,706
Gosh, that scary bitch.
I can't believe she killed her friend.

712
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:25,337
I know you lost the woman you loved.

713
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,547
I'm sorry for your loss,
but I need to say this.

714
00:46:28,423 --> 00:46:30,258
Of course, I hope this won't happen again.

715
00:46:30,342 --> 00:46:31,968
But next time, call the police first.

716
00:46:33,845 --> 00:46:34,971
I didn't love her.

717
00:46:36,723 --> 00:46:38,099
It was just a fling.

718
00:46:39,517 --> 00:46:41,561
Yeon-ji says she's an aspiring actress,

719
00:46:42,062 --> 00:46:43,438
but she has two phones.

720
00:46:43,521 --> 00:46:45,232
I bet she works at a bar.

721
00:46:45,982 --> 00:46:46,858
What

722
00:46:47,734 --> 00:46:48,652
did you just say?

723
00:46:48,735 --> 00:46:50,779
He was carrying two phones around...

724
00:46:51,363 --> 00:46:53,740
Jang Yeon-ji has two cell phones?

725
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,077
Is one of them a 2G phone?

726
00:46:57,494 --> 00:46:58,495
How would I know?

727
00:46:58,787 --> 00:47:01,164
The dead girl told me
that her roomie has two cell phones.

728
00:47:02,832 --> 00:47:04,876
Jeez, I wish she died a few days later.

729
00:47:06,127 --> 00:47:08,296
I was planning on breaking up
with her soon. This sucks.

730
00:47:12,842 --> 00:47:13,843
Damn it.

731
00:47:14,552 --> 00:47:15,971
Have you lost your mind?

732
00:47:16,471 --> 00:47:17,430
Are you nuts?

733
00:47:17,722 --> 00:47:19,975
Did a cop just hit a civilian
in front of the station?

734
00:47:22,018 --> 00:47:22,852
Hey.

735
00:47:23,603 --> 00:47:25,313
Be respectful to the deceased.

736
00:47:25,814 --> 00:47:27,315
Get lost, or I'll punch you again.

737
00:47:29,276 --> 00:47:31,278
I need to close this case and move on too.

738
00:47:54,259 --> 00:47:55,135
Found it.

739
00:47:56,219 --> 00:47:59,389
The charger is here, so the phone must be
somewhere around here too.

740
00:48:05,228 --> 00:48:06,146
Give this to Tae-eul.

741
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,442
She asked me to look him up in the system
due to some intel she received.

742
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:13,028
Additional information on Lee Ji-hun,
age eight. She'll know.

743
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,991
DEATH CERTIFICATE
NAME: LEE JI-HUN

744
00:48:18,908 --> 00:48:20,744
Tae-eul is after a boy

745
00:48:21,494 --> 00:48:22,704
who died 25 years ago?

746
00:48:22,829 --> 00:48:23,913
You know nothing about this?

747
00:48:24,956 --> 00:48:26,166
It must be top-secret.

748
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:27,667
Then give it back.

749
00:48:27,751 --> 00:48:28,793
I know what this is for.

750
00:48:29,836 --> 00:48:32,047
It must be for the science fiction thing.
I'm off.

751
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:33,006
Okay.

752
00:48:35,091 --> 00:48:36,468
Tae-eul, what are you up to?

753
00:48:38,636 --> 00:48:40,889
BUDAEJJIGAE

754
00:48:55,028 --> 00:48:56,154
Now, I know for sure.

755
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:59,616
You know who I am,
and you recognized His Majesty.

756
00:49:08,166 --> 00:49:09,626
You'd better stay put

757
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:11,961
unless you want to die
without legal procedures.

758
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,468
LEASING INQUIRIES

759
00:49:35,318 --> 00:49:36,653
Who are you?

760
00:49:38,905 --> 00:49:41,074
You're from the Kingdom of Corea.
Why are you here?

761
00:49:41,574 --> 00:49:43,034
I want to hear your story.

762
00:49:43,701 --> 00:49:46,454
You are here too, Your Majesty.

763
00:49:49,916 --> 00:49:52,085
I see that you have no interest
in protecting your life.

764
00:49:53,253 --> 00:49:54,838
You must've been trained professionally.

765
00:49:55,547 --> 00:49:57,257
And I bet you work for Lee Lim,
the traitor.

766
00:49:59,217 --> 00:50:00,427
Where is he now?

767
00:50:08,059 --> 00:50:09,936
You look a lot like your father.

768
00:50:11,855 --> 00:50:15,191
Will your life end the same way as he did?

769
00:50:18,695 --> 00:50:21,322
You must be one of those
who stood on my father's blood.

770
00:50:31,875 --> 00:50:34,711
And you came here
as a compensation for that bloodbath?

771
00:50:34,878 --> 00:50:36,963
That is called balance.

772
00:50:37,297 --> 00:50:39,007
It is reasonable and fair.

773
00:50:40,175 --> 00:50:44,179
You were lucky enough to be born
with everything,

774
00:50:44,262 --> 00:50:46,723
so don't whine about losing your father.

775
00:50:47,474 --> 00:50:48,433
Yeong.

776
00:50:56,399 --> 00:50:58,401
Only God can restore that "balance."

777
00:51:00,278 --> 00:51:01,446
What you scoundrels are doing

778
00:51:03,239 --> 00:51:04,324
is murder.

779
00:51:05,617 --> 00:51:06,493
Remember that.

780
00:51:07,202 --> 00:51:08,953
Take him back to the Kingdom of Corea.

781
00:51:09,829 --> 00:51:10,955
Kill me.

782
00:51:12,248 --> 00:51:15,251
Just kill me!

783
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:24,260
There are no numbers saved on this phone.

784
00:51:25,261 --> 00:51:26,638
I suppose this is just for

785
00:51:28,097 --> 00:51:29,974
answering the calls
that you are waiting for.

786
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:34,229
That means I can answer
at least one phone call.

787
00:51:37,565 --> 00:51:39,108
Take your own life.

788
00:51:41,402 --> 00:51:42,737
It is a suicide order.

789
00:51:45,782 --> 00:51:47,325
Inmate 1834, you have a visitor.

790
00:51:56,042 --> 00:51:56,918
What's going on?

791
00:51:57,001 --> 00:51:58,336
Just follow me.

792
00:52:39,877 --> 00:52:41,045
Why did you turn yourself in?

793
00:52:41,129 --> 00:52:42,797
You came to see me because of that.

794
00:52:43,298 --> 00:52:44,799
I had no other choice.

795
00:52:45,758 --> 00:52:47,969
You drew the line,
and I had nowhere to hide.

796
00:52:48,303 --> 00:52:49,220
What else could I do?

797
00:52:49,804 --> 00:52:50,680
Where's the phone?

798
00:52:52,932 --> 00:52:54,392
I already canceled the service,

799
00:52:54,851 --> 00:52:56,060
but I need the phone back.

800
00:52:56,394 --> 00:52:59,063
I hid it in a safe place, of course.
It's my only hope.

801
00:53:01,149 --> 00:53:02,275
When will you get me out?

802
00:53:02,859 --> 00:53:03,860
Where did you hide it?

803
00:53:04,944 --> 00:53:06,154
It's a secret.

804
00:53:07,071 --> 00:53:08,531
When can I go over to the other side?

805
00:53:08,615 --> 00:53:12,368
Jeez. You shouldn't have killed anyone
if you'd wanted to go there.

806
00:53:12,952 --> 00:53:14,537
That too, I had no other choice.

807
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:16,873
Eun-mi

808
00:53:17,457 --> 00:53:18,750
overheard the phone conversation.

809
00:53:21,044 --> 00:53:23,713
You'd better get me out quickly
before I hand it over to the cops.

810
00:53:24,547 --> 00:53:25,548
You can get me out, right?

811
00:53:30,428 --> 00:53:31,512
I'm just curious.

812
00:53:33,473 --> 00:53:35,892
Have you ever heard of a power outage
at a detention center?

813
00:53:37,352 --> 00:53:38,269
What

814
00:53:39,145 --> 00:53:40,104
do you mean?

815
00:53:43,149 --> 00:53:44,609
This isn't a power outage?

816
00:53:53,451 --> 00:53:55,703
I can switch it off and on
whenever it's necessary.

817
00:53:56,829 --> 00:53:57,872
Whatever it may be.

818
00:53:59,582 --> 00:54:00,625
Click.

819
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:05,254
Try to remember

820
00:54:06,798 --> 00:54:08,466
where you hid the 2G phone.

821
00:54:09,801 --> 00:54:11,344
Call me when you remember where it is.

822
00:54:33,282 --> 00:54:35,326
I wish to rent your building
for a little while.

823
00:54:35,785 --> 00:54:36,786
Thank you for your help.

824
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:40,039
Let me know if it's not enough.
If it's more than enough,

825
00:54:41,124 --> 00:54:42,375
can I get one of these?

826
00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:43,793
Jeez.

827
00:54:45,586 --> 00:54:47,755
I'll gladly give you two cups of it.

828
00:54:48,423 --> 00:54:49,924
You know the real estate trends.

829
00:54:53,052 --> 00:54:54,178
Looks like you'll need two.

830
00:54:54,846 --> 00:54:55,930
Tae-eul is here.

831
00:55:07,984 --> 00:55:09,026
Did the stakeout go well?

832
00:55:10,236 --> 00:55:11,863
I heard you caught the culprit too.

833
00:55:13,656 --> 00:55:14,490
No way.

834
00:55:14,907 --> 00:55:16,325
Did you have Jo Yeong tail me again?

835
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,830
Yes, just briefly though.

836
00:55:21,998 --> 00:55:23,708
But he can't do it anymore
as he's busy now.

837
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:26,210
So make sure that buddy of yours
always tags along.

838
00:55:26,794 --> 00:55:27,879
This was a big decision.

839
00:55:28,921 --> 00:55:31,174
You think I'm being like this
because you had him tail me?

840
00:55:31,591 --> 00:55:32,467
Isn't it?

841
00:55:33,092 --> 00:55:35,762
You should've done it yourself.
Why send someone else?

842
00:55:39,015 --> 00:55:40,349
That would be nice,

843
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,226
but I'm not good at hiding.

844
00:55:42,894 --> 00:55:44,103
I stand out wherever I go.

845
00:55:44,854 --> 00:55:47,982
I light up a room just by walking into it.
It should be happening now too.

846
00:55:48,357 --> 00:55:51,152
Na-ri, is it still not ready?
Hurry up. I want a cold drink.

847
00:55:51,235 --> 00:55:52,653
Here are your drinks.

848
00:55:54,781 --> 00:55:56,908
First, just try it without stirring it.

849
00:55:56,991 --> 00:55:59,410
Experience the delicious sweetness,
and then stir it.

850
00:56:01,037 --> 00:56:04,290
Although I can see that there's already
too much sweetness going on here.

851
00:56:07,001 --> 00:56:08,252
Hey, take some <i>japchae</i> home.

852
00:56:10,254 --> 00:56:12,965
Why isn't Eun-sup coming for his <i>japchae</i>?
The noodles will swell up.

853
00:56:14,967 --> 00:56:16,844
I figured out something quite important.

854
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:19,931
I think she has feelings for Eun-sup.

855
00:56:21,933 --> 00:56:22,934
You got it all wrong.

856
00:56:23,434 --> 00:56:25,686
Eun-sup has a crush on her.

857
00:56:26,729 --> 00:56:27,605
No way.

858
00:56:27,688 --> 00:56:30,900
Gosh, you're so slow-witted.
I don't think we can work together.

859
00:56:36,823 --> 00:56:38,324
I looked into this.

860
00:56:39,116 --> 00:56:40,451
His name is Lee Seong-jae.

861
00:56:41,285 --> 00:56:43,955
He died in 1995 at a care center.

862
00:56:45,164 --> 00:56:48,376
That's where he was last seen,
but there are no records.

863
00:56:49,585 --> 00:56:51,712
And he supposedly died a natural death.

864
00:56:51,796 --> 00:56:53,172
Did he have poliomyelitis?

865
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,841
Yes, he did.

866
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:56,634
Did he have a family?

867
00:57:02,181 --> 00:57:03,182
Do I exist

868
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:05,226
in this world?

869
00:57:12,775 --> 00:57:13,860
No, not anymore.

870
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:16,112
He died when he was eight.

871
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:20,366
So he first killed himself

872
00:57:22,076 --> 00:57:23,160
and then killed me.

873
00:57:25,788 --> 00:57:26,789
Any other family members?

874
00:57:27,331 --> 00:57:30,209
A brother or sister-in-law, for instance.

875
00:57:31,377 --> 00:57:33,004
His younger brother also died.

876
00:57:33,671 --> 00:57:35,047
But that brother's wife...

877
00:57:36,841 --> 00:57:37,842
She's still alive.

878
00:57:47,685 --> 00:57:48,519
Are you all right?

879
00:57:49,896 --> 00:57:51,772
If he and Lee Lim had
the same family members,

880
00:57:53,149 --> 00:57:54,150
then his sister-in-law

881
00:57:55,526 --> 00:57:57,236
would probably have my mother's face.

882
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,866
Her name is Song Jeong-hye.

883
00:58:06,621 --> 00:58:07,872
Are you free tomorrow afternoon?

884
00:58:08,581 --> 00:58:10,708
I'm planning to visit her address.

885
00:58:11,417 --> 00:58:12,501
You must cooperate.

886
00:58:14,545 --> 00:58:15,546
I am at your command.

887
00:58:23,888 --> 00:58:24,847
You were right.

888
00:58:25,598 --> 00:58:26,515
About what?

889
00:58:27,224 --> 00:58:29,101
That part of the room looks so bright.

890
00:58:54,627 --> 00:58:55,670
<i>Father...</i>

891
00:58:55,753 --> 00:58:57,505
<i>After his coronation, King Lee Gon</i>

892
00:58:57,588 --> 00:59:00,216
<i>began his first duty as King,
mourning his father's death for 26 days</i>

893
00:59:00,299 --> 00:59:02,093
<i>according to court laws.</i>

894
01:00:01,318 --> 01:00:03,404
That man came by, looking for Ji-hun.

895
01:00:05,906 --> 01:00:07,616
I guess we'll finally get busted.

896
01:00:15,583 --> 01:00:17,126
Is he Ji-hun's friend?

897
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:20,254
He seems to be around Ji-hun's age,
you know.

898
01:00:24,175 --> 01:00:25,134
You can report it.

899
01:00:26,052 --> 01:00:27,094
I don't care.

900
01:00:31,348 --> 01:00:32,725
I won't die anyway.

901
01:00:36,812 --> 01:00:37,688
I can't die.

902
01:00:39,565 --> 01:00:41,484
You people will bring me
back to life again.

903
01:01:05,466 --> 01:01:08,594
<i>Let's go home, Let's go home. Go home, go!</i>

904
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,555
<i>I want to go home, home, home.</i>

905
01:01:18,062 --> 01:01:20,481
What? I didn't know you were there.

906
01:01:21,649 --> 01:01:23,692
Gosh, I just wanted to wear his coat.

907
01:01:28,614 --> 01:01:31,826
Wow, I look great.

908
01:01:33,869 --> 01:01:37,081
Oh, come on. What is this?
A picture with his boss as the wallpaper?

909
01:01:37,164 --> 01:01:40,417
Jeez, this nutcase. Is he on something?
Something is definitely wrong with him.

910
01:01:40,501 --> 01:01:41,502
Who?

911
01:01:42,294 --> 01:01:44,171
Gosh, you scared me.

912
01:01:44,255 --> 01:01:45,506
Hey, Sin-jae!

913
01:01:45,673 --> 01:01:48,384
-Leaving for the day?
-Yes, 6 p.m. on the dot.

914
01:01:48,467 --> 01:01:49,844
I'm leaving right on time today.

915
01:01:49,927 --> 01:01:51,387
And tomorrow, I'll be done for good!

916
01:01:51,762 --> 01:01:52,805
You're discharged tomorrow.

917
01:01:52,888 --> 01:01:54,014
-Yes.
-Congratulations.

918
01:01:54,098 --> 01:01:55,224
Hand that phone over.

919
01:01:59,812 --> 01:02:00,771
The phone?

920
01:02:01,897 --> 01:02:04,108
Why? It's my new phone.

921
01:02:04,191 --> 01:02:05,693
I saw something weird on it.

922
01:02:07,069 --> 01:02:08,112
Must I take it by force?

923
01:02:08,195 --> 01:02:09,697
Well...

924
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:12,408
That guy, Arthur, you know?
He came back and--

925
01:02:12,491 --> 01:02:13,659
Don't move.

926
01:02:23,627 --> 01:02:26,797
-It's a photo of me and him.
-I can't talk for long now.

927
01:02:28,007 --> 01:02:29,216
I'll say I believe you.

928
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:31,093
Just tell me where this prick is now.

929
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:36,765
He's at a hotel.

930
01:02:39,018 --> 01:02:41,061
He was staying with me,
but my siblings are visiting,

931
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,397
so I booked a room for him under my name.

932
01:02:44,773 --> 01:02:46,442
Then they'll give me a key
if I go with you.

933
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,654
Why schedule all the on-site visits
in the evening?

934
01:02:51,447 --> 01:02:53,449
Gosh, I almost swore at them.

935
01:03:01,207 --> 01:03:06,295
Prime Minister Koo, the Secretariat sent
the 2019 departmental performance report.

936
01:03:06,378 --> 01:03:09,215
Why does everyone look for me
whenever I have this on?

937
01:03:14,011 --> 01:03:15,638
Does this thing have a sensor
or something?

938
01:03:15,721 --> 01:03:17,556
Does it trigger an alarm when I rest?

939
01:03:18,515 --> 01:03:19,350
Of course not.

940
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:22,353
It's the holiday season,
so you received many invitations.

941
01:03:23,103 --> 01:03:25,814
Why do these people keep inviting me
when I never attend their events?

942
01:03:26,982 --> 01:03:29,026
They just love to bad-mouth me
for not coming.

943
01:03:30,527 --> 01:03:32,821
Your family sent you something else.

944
01:03:32,905 --> 01:03:33,989
Again?

945
01:03:40,204 --> 01:03:41,789
Thank you. You should call it a day.

946
01:03:41,872 --> 01:03:42,790
Thank you.

947
01:03:50,673 --> 01:03:53,926
US PRESIDENT TRUMP VISITS NORTH KOREA

948
01:03:55,219 --> 01:03:56,303
It's the same one.

949
01:04:20,786 --> 01:04:21,662
<i>Hello?</i>

950
01:04:21,745 --> 01:04:22,621
Mom.

951
01:04:23,247 --> 01:04:25,416
You really didn't send me anything
in the mail?

952
01:04:25,916 --> 01:04:27,001
You didn't send a newspaper?

953
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:28,085
<i>Newspaper?</i>

954
01:04:28,794 --> 01:04:31,630
<i>Who reads newspapers these days?
Everyone uses their phones.</i>

955
01:04:32,715 --> 01:04:34,258
<i>I was actually going to call you--</i>

956
01:04:34,341 --> 01:04:35,968
Mom, I'll call you later.

957
01:04:44,143 --> 01:04:46,770
A repeating pattern is
the universe trying to give you a sign.

958

01:05:10,252 --> 01:05:11,503
What is this?

962
01:05:12,379 --> 01:05:14,048

BY LEE JONG-IN

966
01:06:49,226 --> 01:06:51,687
THE KINGDOM OF COREA ROYAL COURT

967
01:06:54,898 --> 01:06:55,816
What logo is this?

968
01:06:57,526 --> 01:06:58,902
<i>I'm asking because I saw it before.</i>

969
01:07:00,571 --> 01:07:02,448
<i>Wherever you think you saw it,
you're mistaken.</i>

970
01:07:03,198 --> 01:07:04,491
That logo isn't used here...

971
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,868
<i>Today is the 6th day
of the former King's funeral.</i>

972
01:07:05,951 --> 01:07:07,828
<i>After his coronation, King Lee Gon...</i>

973
01:07:07,911 --> 01:07:10,330
<i>...in a different country in another
world. It's not used here.</i>

974
01:07:49,286 --> 01:07:50,245
Jo Eun-sup.

975
01:07:51,497 --> 01:07:52,664
I just saw you in the lobby...

976
01:07:57,127 --> 01:07:57,961
Who are you?

977
01:07:58,879 --> 01:08:00,214
You're not Eun-sup.

978
01:08:14,102 --> 01:08:15,604
What is going on here?

979
01:08:19,816 --> 01:08:21,693
This guy was going through
Your Majesty's room.

980
01:08:28,784 --> 01:08:30,786
I know you've been after this emblem.

981
01:08:31,954 --> 01:08:34,665
But you don't know what it is, do you?

982
01:08:34,748 --> 01:08:35,666
What is it?

983
01:08:35,749 --> 01:08:36,917
It's our royal emblem.

984
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,126
Don't bullshit me.

985
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:40,504
You're just
an unregistered stateless dirtbag.

986
01:08:45,884 --> 01:08:47,261
This bastard even has a gun?

987
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:53,016
Who the heck are you guys?

988
01:08:56,144 --> 01:08:57,145
If I tell you,

989
01:08:58,981 --> 01:09:00,399
will you believe me this time?

990
01:09:01,108 --> 01:09:02,401
I've already told you who I am,

991
01:09:03,735 --> 01:09:04,570
multiple times.

992
01:09:04,653 --> 01:09:06,154
Don't bullshit me. Tell me the truth.

993
01:09:08,532 --> 01:09:09,491
Then,

994
01:09:10,284 --> 01:09:11,326
where is your kingdom?

995
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:13,537
Somewhere else, not here.

996
01:09:14,788 --> 01:09:15,789
To be more exact,

997
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:18,083
it's in a different world.

998
01:09:19,459 --> 01:09:21,086
I've answered all your questions.

999
01:09:22,713 --> 01:09:24,673
Now, it's your turn.

1000
01:09:27,509 --> 01:09:28,385
Who are you?

1001
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:31,346
Who the heck are you?

1002
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:35,934
Are you

1003
01:09:40,230 --> 01:09:41,231
Lee Gon?

1004
01:09:46,445 --> 01:09:47,779
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul

1005
01:09:50,032 --> 01:09:51,742
even told you things like that?

1006
01:09:53,327 --> 01:09:54,328
Tae-eul

1007
01:09:55,871 --> 01:09:56,955
knows about this too?

1008
01:09:58,332 --> 01:10:00,292
She's not the one who told you?

1009
01:10:05,464 --> 01:10:10,260
<i>The public is watching the young King's
formality with a sad heart.</i>

1010
01:10:10,344 --> 01:10:12,804
<i>Father...</i>

1011
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,058
That boy who was crying...

1012
01:10:17,976 --> 01:10:19,186
That was really you?

1013
01:10:21,146 --> 01:10:22,397
Are you really

1014
01:10:24,775 --> 01:10:25,901
Lee Gon?

1015
01:10:27,277 --> 01:10:28,904
<i>He heard my wailing.</i>

1016
01:10:30,113 --> 01:10:31,156
<i>A lot more people</i>

1017
01:10:31,948 --> 01:10:34,326
<i>have come over
to this world than I had thought.</i>

1018
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:37,996
Answer my question, asshole.

1019
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,207
Hands off unless you want to die.

1020
01:10:40,791 --> 01:10:41,833
One thing is for sure.

1021
01:10:46,129 --> 01:10:48,548
You are the reason
why I must return to my world.

1022
01:10:52,928 --> 01:10:53,970
It seems like

1023
01:10:57,516 --> 01:10:59,017
I am your king.
