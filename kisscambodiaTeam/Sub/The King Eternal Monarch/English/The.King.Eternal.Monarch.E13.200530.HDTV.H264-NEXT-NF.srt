THE KING: ETERNAL MONARCH

2
00:00:04,992 --> 00:00:07,953
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:08,037 --> 00:00:09,914
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:11,374 --> 00:00:13,125
EPISODE 13

5
00:00:14,877 --> 00:00:17,213
What happened to that war?

6
00:00:18,547 --> 00:00:24,345
The war that broke out in June, 1950.

7
00:00:29,934 --> 00:00:31,477
How do you know

8
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:34,772
about that war?

9
00:00:38,192 --> 00:00:40,611
What you are thinking is right.

10
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,868
It was during the still of the dawn.

11
00:00:49,036 --> 00:00:51,831
The cannons began to roar like thunder,

12
00:00:52,957 --> 00:00:54,291
and all hell broke loose.

13
00:00:56,085 --> 00:00:57,128
I was at a loss

14
00:00:58,504 --> 00:01:02,049
after losing my parents and siblings.

15
00:01:03,843 --> 00:01:05,344
Then one man came up to me

16
00:01:07,221 --> 00:01:11,142
and asked if I wanted to go
to a world without war.

17
00:01:14,812 --> 00:01:17,022
I left my hometown with just this book,

18
00:01:17,815 --> 00:01:21,444
not knowing that
I would never be able to return.

19
00:01:23,446 --> 00:01:25,156
That man was

20
00:01:27,324 --> 00:01:29,660
His Majesty's grandfather, King Haejong.

21
00:01:34,123 --> 00:01:35,124
What happened

22
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:38,252
to that world's history after that?

23
00:01:45,468 --> 00:01:50,139
There was an armistice
three years after the war broke out.

24
00:01:52,057 --> 00:01:54,727
The country is now divided
into North and South Korea,

25
00:01:55,436 --> 00:01:57,772
so we can't go to Hwanghae Province
from Seoul.

26
00:02:01,984 --> 00:02:02,902
I'm sorry

27
00:02:03,611 --> 00:02:05,154
to tell you such sad news.

28
00:02:07,072 --> 00:02:07,948
No.

29
00:02:09,992 --> 00:02:11,786
It's fine.

30
00:02:14,747 --> 00:02:16,916
There were many sad days,

31
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:19,418
but now I know

32
00:02:22,296 --> 00:02:25,132
that everything was my destiny.

33
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,390
Just like how you ended up here.

34
00:02:39,814 --> 00:02:40,815
<i>All right.</i>

35
00:02:41,398 --> 00:02:42,483
Let's talk about that first.

36
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,902
Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to talk.

37
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,156
Everything in the news is true.

38
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,577
She's the woman I love.

39
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:55,955
I support her

40
00:02:57,122 --> 00:02:58,624
every step and every moment.

41
00:03:03,921 --> 00:03:05,923
You're always so honest, Your Majesty.

42
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:09,260
Even in moments like this.

43
00:03:13,347 --> 00:03:14,890
That woman has a criminal record.

44
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,519
Are you thinking of
deceiving the entire country?

45
00:03:18,602 --> 00:03:21,313
I'm not asking for your support on this.

46
00:03:21,397 --> 00:03:22,273
No.

47
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:24,692
That's not it.

48
00:03:25,276 --> 00:03:27,444
I liked being next to you.

49
00:03:29,113 --> 00:03:31,407
That was where I could see you the best.

50
00:03:32,867 --> 00:03:35,160
But you say that it is not my place.

51
00:03:36,453 --> 00:03:37,371
What should I do now?

52
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,460
Will I be able to see you better

53
00:03:45,296 --> 00:03:46,589
if I stood in opposition to you?

54
00:03:57,933 --> 00:03:59,268
Stop, Prime Minister Koo.

55
00:04:01,186 --> 00:04:03,147
-If you cross the line any further--
-I...

56
00:04:04,273 --> 00:04:05,816
started at the bottom

57
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:09,361
and climbed up all the way here
toward the King.

58
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,947
But since you've had it all to start with,

59
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,784
the only thing that moves you is love.

60
00:04:17,912 --> 00:04:20,164
What will my heart beat for now,
Your Majesty?

61
00:04:20,247 --> 00:04:22,541
I don't think it'll be for
honesty and loyalty.

62
00:04:38,515 --> 00:04:40,309
I must not have fully recovered yet.

63
00:04:41,143 --> 00:04:42,227
I'll be off now.

64
00:04:43,228 --> 00:04:44,855
I'll see you for the state affairs report.

65
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:58,994
Contact the National Forensic Service
and ask if they have the autopsy results

66
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:01,455
of the traitor Kim Gi-hwan.

67
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:12,132
<i>Since the moment your ID card
fell into the hands of His Majesty,</i>

68
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:18,514
you have been the one guiding him
to his fate.

69
00:05:20,307 --> 00:05:21,141
Please

70
00:05:22,142 --> 00:05:24,436
take good care of His Majesty.

71
00:06:00,597 --> 00:06:01,765
We meet again.

72
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:03,308
Right.

73
00:06:03,392 --> 00:06:06,061
We met at Gwanghwamun, right?

74
00:06:06,645 --> 00:06:07,855
I saw you buying shoes.

75
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:10,065
Ms. Koo Eun-a.

76
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:14,653
Oh, sorry.

77
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:18,282
I haven't seen anyone in this country
mistake me for someone else.

78
00:06:18,365 --> 00:06:20,617
I was talking about when we met
at KU Building.

79
00:06:22,244 --> 00:06:25,289
Shouldn't you know Prime Minister
Koo Seo-ryeong by now

80
00:06:25,456 --> 00:06:26,749
if you plan to live here?

81
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:30,627
The proposal you received
shook the whole nation.

82
00:06:32,171 --> 00:06:34,506
What did you do before and after
you met me?

83
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:36,967
I'm sure you didn't just buy shoes.

84
00:06:40,179 --> 00:06:42,389
Stop acting so cocky and move.

85
00:06:43,891 --> 00:06:45,184
You can't stop me yet.

86
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:47,686
You walked in here yourself,
and you're the one who stopped.

87
00:06:49,772 --> 00:06:50,981
Your heart feels heavy, right?

88
00:06:51,565 --> 00:06:54,651
That's how heavy guilt can be.

89
00:07:05,496 --> 00:07:07,623
Are you curious about what I did?

90
00:07:09,374 --> 00:07:11,168
Of course, I didn't just buy shoes.

91
00:07:14,922 --> 00:07:18,175
I mean the day we met
at KU Building, of course.

92
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,121
All right. I'll head there right away.

93
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,835
I'm sorry, but you should go to bed first.

94
00:07:54,211 --> 00:07:57,589
The coroner found the mark
on Kim Gi-hwan's body.

95
00:07:58,048 --> 00:07:59,174
I need to go and check.

96
00:07:59,258 --> 00:08:02,052
Do you know that Koo Seo-ryeong
has that mark too?

97
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:03,554
Did you see it too?

98
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:05,472
I ran into her in the hallway.

99
00:08:06,056 --> 00:08:08,016
She crossed between worlds, too.

100
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:11,395
I saw her in my world before,
and I confirmed it just now.

101
00:08:12,437 --> 00:08:14,231
That's why she was tying me down.

102
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:18,902
To place herself in the opposition,
with Lee Lim.

103
00:08:20,404 --> 00:08:22,614
But she knows
that I found out about her now.

104
00:08:22,698 --> 00:08:23,615
Will it be okay?

105
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:26,577
Criminals act recklessly
when they've been cornered.

106
00:08:27,161 --> 00:08:28,287
That would be great.

107
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,748
If I decide to act recklessly as well,

108
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:33,792
no one can beat me.

109
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:37,671
Leave this to me, and just get some rest.

110
00:08:38,255 --> 00:08:39,715
-I want to be with you, but--
-I know.

111
00:08:40,424 --> 00:08:42,593
Nothing good will happen if I get exposed.

112
00:08:42,676 --> 00:08:45,846
I'll try to make it quick,
but I'll probably return tomorrow morning.

113
00:08:46,722 --> 00:08:48,265
I'll be back with Eun-sup.

114
00:09:00,944 --> 00:09:01,820
Your Majesty.

115
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:06,158
KIM JU-HYEON
CENTRAL FORENSICS MEDICAL CENTER

116
00:09:08,368 --> 00:09:09,453
NAME: KIM GI-HWAN

117
00:09:09,536 --> 00:09:12,039
As you can see, there is a scar
that looks like a burn

118
00:09:12,706 --> 00:09:15,500
on the left side of his chest.

119
00:09:20,505 --> 00:09:21,632
Did you say

120
00:09:22,841 --> 00:09:24,176
you've seen that scar before?

121
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:27,763
Yes.

122
00:09:33,685 --> 00:09:36,688
To be honest, nobody believed me
until now.

123
00:09:37,773 --> 00:09:43,820
I've worked for 11 years, and I've seen
three bodies with the same scar.

124
00:09:44,363 --> 00:09:46,782
And all on rainy days like today.

125
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:50,535
But what's strange is that all three

126
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:54,581
had served terms in prison for parricide.

127
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,876
<i>Those that killed their counterparts</i>

128
00:09:58,335 --> 00:10:01,922
<i>and crossed worlds would
get caught easily by their families.</i>

129
00:10:02,673 --> 00:10:05,509
Please check if there are any other
cases like this.

130
00:10:06,343 --> 00:10:08,720
-I need to find the answer to something.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

131
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:23,944
What is it?

132
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,613
Is it a supplement?

133
00:10:35,914 --> 00:10:38,166
Let go of that.

134
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:40,294
That's right.

135
00:10:43,422 --> 00:10:46,133
Should I tell you a secret before you die?

136
00:10:46,717 --> 00:10:48,135
His Majesty will arrive soon.

137
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,886
I'll do the security check.

138
00:10:51,596 --> 00:10:53,432
I remember he did something like this.

139
00:11:04,443 --> 00:11:07,279
<i>This beautiful land
With rivers and mountains</i>

140
00:11:07,362 --> 00:11:10,657
<i>Was chosen by Dangun</i>

141
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:13,535
<i>He built a nation to benefit mankind</i>

142
00:11:13,744 --> 00:11:16,788
<i>There are generations of great people, yo!</i>

143
00:11:16,872 --> 00:11:19,708
<i>King Dongmyeong founded Goguryeo
King Onjo founded Baekje</i>

144
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,002
<i>And Hyeokgeose who was born from an egg</i>

145
00:11:22,669 --> 00:11:25,672
<i>Gwanggaeto the Great rode across Manju</i>

146
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,508
<i>Silla's General Isabu</i>

147
00:11:30,552 --> 00:11:32,846
Yes, Your Majesty.
I'm finally getting discharged tomorrow!

148
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:35,640
I'll get a good night's sleep
and see you tomorrow.

149
00:11:37,184 --> 00:11:38,018
Die.

150
00:11:38,602 --> 00:11:41,104
You know, that song is about
the 100 great people of Korea.

151
00:11:42,689 --> 00:11:43,982
But it's not actually 100 people.

152
00:12:06,463 --> 00:12:07,381
Great work.

153
00:12:08,048 --> 00:12:09,049
And thank you again.

154
00:12:10,926 --> 00:12:12,761
You have to open the car door for me
next time.

155
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:16,640
Is the Kingdom going to be okay
without me?

156
00:12:18,308 --> 00:12:19,851
When should Tae-eul and I go?

157
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:22,104
Maybe tomorrow at dawn.

158
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:28,402
It's about time she said she'll leave.

159
00:12:36,034 --> 00:12:38,578
Wow, it must be pouring.

160
00:12:42,707 --> 00:12:43,875
Are you all right?

161
00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:47,045
You don't have a scar like a burn
or feel pain?

162
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:48,797
I'm still in my 20s, you know.

163
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:51,049
I'm not old. Why would I feel pain
when it rains?

164
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,970
So you and Tae-eul don't have it,
but I do.

165
00:12:56,721 --> 00:12:58,014
What do you have?

166
00:12:59,182 --> 00:13:01,226
The mark of people who've killed
their counterparts.

167
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,395
What are

168
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:06,398
these scars?

169
00:13:18,952 --> 00:13:20,787
Chairman Choe is on
the special pardons list.

170
00:13:20,912 --> 00:13:22,289
He'll be released on <i>Gyeongchip.</i>

171
00:13:22,831 --> 00:13:23,874
All right.

172
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,417
Get a doctor's appointment for me.

173
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:27,502
A dermatologist.

174
00:13:28,462 --> 00:13:29,588
Wait, no.

175
00:13:30,464 --> 00:13:31,756
A psychologist?

176
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:34,885
Didn't you see the doctor
during your vacation?

177
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:36,887
Prime Minister.

178
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,016
Are you not going to tell me
what you did during vacation?

179
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:49,357
I guess I like you more than
I thought I did.

180
00:13:51,693 --> 00:13:53,445
You'll be in danger if you know,
so don't ask.

181
00:13:55,238 --> 00:13:58,742
EOSU BOOKSTORE

182
00:14:20,722 --> 00:14:23,600
You look exactly the same,
so you're definitely not

183
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:26,102
Lee Lim's hidden son.

184
00:14:27,687 --> 00:14:30,106
You look exactly like
when I saw you in the textbooks.

185
00:14:33,068 --> 00:14:34,027
Who are you?

186
00:14:37,906 --> 00:14:39,616
Are you the one who sent me this?

187
00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:40,700
US PRESIDENT TRUMP VISITS NORTH KOREA

188
00:14:45,664 --> 00:14:49,292
Your parents at least respected me.

189
00:14:50,961 --> 00:14:54,756
They feared me, listened to me,
and kept their heads bowed.

190
00:14:56,716 --> 00:14:59,844
So you're Lee Lim, and not a hidden son?

191
00:14:59,928 --> 00:15:02,806
You have a lot of questions,
so I guess you'll get the answers quickly.

192
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:06,643
Then you'd be 70 years old.
How is that appearance possible?

193
00:15:07,727 --> 00:15:09,229
And President Trump of the US?

194
00:15:18,905 --> 00:15:20,115
What is this?

195
00:15:20,282 --> 00:15:21,950
Who is that woman
who looks exactly like me?

196
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,953
Which question should I answer first?

197
00:15:33,545 --> 00:15:36,756
As you can see, I'm not dead.

198
00:15:42,137 --> 00:15:45,056
That woman is you in a different world.

199
00:15:45,932 --> 00:15:50,312
Her fingerprints, DNA, appearance,
and birthdate are the same as yours.

200
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,361
There is a parallel world
called the Republic of Korea.

201
00:16:08,288 --> 00:16:09,748
Am I getting blackmailed right now?

202
00:16:10,915 --> 00:16:12,375
If my answer is wrong,

203
00:16:16,421 --> 00:16:18,089
will that woman replace me?

204
00:16:24,846 --> 00:16:26,806
I've met thousands of people until now,

205
00:16:27,932 --> 00:16:32,020
but you're the first one to know
the next step without having to teach you.

206
00:16:38,068 --> 00:16:39,110
What will you do?

207
00:16:40,945 --> 00:16:42,530
Will you try to answer my question?

208
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:56,419
The men of the Royal Family really know
how to make me laugh.

209
00:16:58,296 --> 00:17:01,257
It's only right for you to prove
your ability first.

210
00:17:03,677 --> 00:17:05,095
Take me to that place.

211
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:08,890
The other world.

212
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:12,352
To the Republic of Korea.

213
00:17:19,317 --> 00:17:22,487
<i>You're the one who chose</i>

214
00:17:25,198 --> 00:17:28,076
<i>where I should go in these heels,
Your Majesty.</i>

215
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:31,955
<i>My guest</i>

216
00:17:33,456 --> 00:17:34,332
wants to go out?

217
00:17:34,457 --> 00:17:36,751
Yes, she asked for a guard
with a big build,

218
00:17:36,835 --> 00:17:39,212
so I sent the best trainee
of the Royal Guard, Jang Mi-reuk.

219
00:17:39,295 --> 00:17:41,005
And I gave them a business phone as well.

220
00:17:44,592 --> 00:17:47,220
You really look exactly like Jangmi.

221
00:17:48,888 --> 00:17:51,683
I heard you're the best trainee
of the Royal Guard.

222
00:17:51,891 --> 00:17:52,809
Yes, I am.

223
00:17:53,643 --> 00:17:56,187
Sorry, but how did you know my nickname?

224
00:17:57,939 --> 00:17:58,857
Really?

225
00:17:59,274 --> 00:18:00,984
Is your name Jang Michael?

226
00:18:01,317 --> 00:18:02,527
My name's Jang Mi-reuk.

227
00:18:04,904 --> 00:18:07,323
Even your names are similar.

228
00:18:08,032 --> 00:18:09,409
Anyway, it's nice to meet you.

229
00:18:09,993 --> 00:18:11,578
I need to look for a certain place.

230
00:18:12,662 --> 00:18:15,832
It's a snack or bread factory
about an hour's drive away

231
00:18:15,915 --> 00:18:19,252
from this salt field here.

232
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,297
That area
is a development restricted area,

233
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,548
so there aren't any factories.

234
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:25,049
It's just a forest there.

235
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:26,301
Really?

236
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:29,304
I regained my consciousness
while I was being dragged away,

237
00:18:29,387 --> 00:18:32,891
and I'm sure I smelled something sweet,
like cotton candy.

238
00:18:33,475 --> 00:18:35,977
If it smelled like cotton candy,
you've found the right place.

239
00:18:36,978 --> 00:18:38,938
That area is full of cinnamon trees.

240
00:18:39,022 --> 00:18:40,106
Cinnamon trees?

241
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:45,153
Yes, just two trees are enough
to spread a strong sweet scent.

242
00:18:46,946 --> 00:18:49,199
That must be it. Let's go there.

243
00:18:49,991 --> 00:18:50,909
<i>What's the number?</i>

244
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:53,286
She could just go with me.
Why would she...

245
00:18:53,495 --> 00:18:55,622
She said that you must be very busy

246
00:18:56,581 --> 00:18:57,999
so she'd go there alone.

247
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:00,919
Let's go over the urgent matter first.

248
00:19:01,002 --> 00:19:03,922
There are many urgent matters,
so let's fix the most urgent one first.

249
00:19:04,214 --> 00:19:06,090
When are you planning on getting married?

250
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:09,135
The nation is buzzing
with talk about the Queen.

251
00:19:09,219 --> 00:19:11,346
It seems like we need to make
an official announcement.

252
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:12,847
Shall we just do it, or postpone it?

253
00:19:12,931 --> 00:19:14,140
Let's postpone it for now.

254
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:16,935
I still haven't received an answer
to my proposal.

255
00:19:19,312 --> 00:19:20,271
Isn't that harsh?

256
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:22,315
Really?

257
00:19:22,398 --> 00:19:24,901
Stopping Prime Minister Koo
is more urgent right now.

258
00:19:25,276 --> 00:19:27,445
You should go to the prison

259
00:19:28,071 --> 00:19:30,949
and tell KU Group's Chairman Choe
to send a representative

260
00:19:31,324 --> 00:19:32,367
by today.

261
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:34,994
Tell him to make a choice

262
00:19:35,537 --> 00:19:36,955
between his company and his ex-wife.

263
00:19:38,456 --> 00:19:40,834
And tell him I don't want
the representative visiting twice.

264
00:19:41,084 --> 00:19:41,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

265
00:19:44,754 --> 00:19:45,713
Where's Court Lady Noh?

266
00:19:46,214 --> 00:19:47,465
I haven't seen her.

267
00:19:50,426 --> 00:19:51,302
She's here.

268
00:19:55,139 --> 00:19:56,975
When you're not in my sight,

269
00:19:57,684 --> 00:20:00,270
it's either for a talisman
or something's happened in the palace.

270
00:20:01,312 --> 00:20:04,065
Yes, Your Majesty. It's the latter.

271
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:08,069
Actually, I've caught a spy.

272
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,865
And I got new chickens
during that process.

273
00:20:14,367 --> 00:20:15,785
Someone was using poison?

274
00:20:24,711 --> 00:20:28,047
<i>The spy was a court lady
named Park Suk-jin.</i>

275
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:34,304
<i>I heard that she had been visiting
the bookstore of the traitors.</i>

276
00:20:35,138 --> 00:20:37,640
<i>She came out of that bookstore
and burned that photo.</i>

277
00:20:40,476 --> 00:20:45,648
When I was revealing her identity,
she suddenly spat out blood.

278
00:20:46,608 --> 00:20:50,236
So his parents were the ones being used.

279
00:20:52,322 --> 00:20:54,282
I still haven't paid him back
for my meal, though.

280
00:20:56,326 --> 00:20:58,328
How is she? Is she in critical condition?

281
00:20:58,828 --> 00:21:01,122
No, she's conscious now.

282
00:21:03,499 --> 00:21:08,296
But she asked to talk to you in person.

283
00:21:30,652 --> 00:21:31,653
You asked to see me?

284
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,989
You've fooled me for such a long time.

285
00:21:37,992 --> 00:21:39,744
I saw you, Your Majesty.

286
00:21:42,497 --> 00:21:43,373
I saw you

287
00:21:45,124 --> 00:21:47,126
with my son, Kang Sin-jae.

288
00:21:49,796 --> 00:21:51,965
It was the last photo that Lee Lim
gave to me.

289
00:21:54,092 --> 00:21:55,301
And with it,

290
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,721
I received the poison.

291
00:22:01,557 --> 00:22:04,185
<i>You haven't fulfilled your role yet.</i>

292
00:22:06,062 --> 00:22:09,983
This will be the last photo
that you receive.

293
00:22:11,442 --> 00:22:14,487
So I gambled.

294
00:22:15,947 --> 00:22:17,323
I drank the poison

295
00:22:19,575 --> 00:22:21,202
instead of poisoning you.

296
00:22:22,829 --> 00:22:26,499
If I died, I'd be paying for my sins,

297
00:22:28,376 --> 00:22:29,293
and if I lived,

298
00:22:30,586 --> 00:22:32,797
I'd talk to you in person like this.

299
00:22:45,476 --> 00:22:46,644
It's shameless of me,

300
00:22:47,937 --> 00:22:49,981
but I'm asking you to decide

301
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:52,650
the fate of my son.

302
00:22:57,363 --> 00:22:59,198
He didn't do anything wrong.

303
00:23:00,116 --> 00:23:00,992
Please.

304
00:23:01,701 --> 00:23:02,577
Please.

305
00:23:04,203 --> 00:23:06,372
Please protect my son, Your Majesty.

306
00:23:15,965 --> 00:23:19,010
<i>Father-in-law, Yu Heung-ik, 510727.</i>

307
00:23:19,218 --> 00:23:22,013
<i>Mother-in-law, Choe Ok-seon, 530305.</i>

308
00:23:23,097 --> 00:23:25,892
<i>Husband Yu Hyeon-jun, 770614.</i>

309
00:23:26,434 --> 00:23:29,520
<i>Sister-in-law Yu Hyeon-seo, 791112.</i>

310
00:23:32,982 --> 00:23:37,403
Your baby must be the luckiest
baby in the Kingdom of Corea.

311
00:23:38,362 --> 00:23:42,116
You're the heir to a fortune
and your husband is a chairman.

312
00:23:45,578 --> 00:23:46,662
I know.

313
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:51,584
<i>Father-in-law, Yu Heung-ik, 510727.</i>

314
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:54,629
<i>Mother-in-law, Choe Ok-seon, 530305.</i>

315
00:24:08,017 --> 00:24:08,893
What?

316
00:24:13,856 --> 00:24:14,941
What am I doing here?

317
00:24:18,986 --> 00:24:20,196
What am I doing here?

318
00:24:23,699 --> 00:24:25,243
My baby, hang on.

319
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:29,330
Don't do this.

320
00:24:37,255 --> 00:24:38,339
What happened?

321
00:24:38,548 --> 00:24:41,801
Why am I in a place like this?

322
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,989
What? Is there something in the yard?

323
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:07,535
What's with you today?

324
00:25:09,328 --> 00:25:10,913
Are you staking out at a club?

325
00:25:11,455 --> 00:25:12,748
Were you heading out or in?

326
00:25:13,332 --> 00:25:15,251
Did you eat? If you didn't, let's eat.

327
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:21,799
Jeong-hun's mother was really generous
with homemade soybean paste.

328
00:25:28,806 --> 00:25:30,808
Homemade soybean paste is the best.

329
00:25:31,017 --> 00:25:33,144
The soup is amazing.

330
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,941
What is that look?

331
00:25:40,026 --> 00:25:41,444
Are you complaining about your food?

332
00:25:42,028 --> 00:25:42,904
Stop making that face.

333
00:25:43,321 --> 00:25:45,990
I prepared pretty nice
side dishes today, you know.

334
00:25:52,538 --> 00:25:53,748
Dad.

335
00:25:54,665 --> 00:25:55,499
What?

336
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,961
Am I a nice daughter?

337
00:25:59,045 --> 00:26:00,087
Of course.

338
00:26:00,671 --> 00:26:02,298
You're nice once a month.

339
00:26:02,715 --> 00:26:04,842
On the 29th. When you receive your salary.

340
00:26:05,927 --> 00:26:08,095
There's one week left.

341
00:26:08,804 --> 00:26:12,975
Put the dishes in the sink after you eat.
I'm leaving now.

342
00:27:24,046 --> 00:27:25,548
It's a Gemini.

343
00:27:29,135 --> 00:27:30,469
That sucks.

344
00:27:35,198 --> 00:27:36,699
<i>Why are you here again?</i>

345
00:27:38,284 --> 00:27:39,702
I have nowhere to go.

346
00:27:41,788 --> 00:27:44,207
You're watching me 24 hours a day.

347
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:46,459
Where could I go?

348
00:27:52,966 --> 00:27:54,676
I used to work there

349
00:27:56,261 --> 00:27:57,929
when I had Ji-hun.

350
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:10,817
I'm going to scream.

351
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,194
Should I make people rush over here?

352
00:28:16,531 --> 00:28:17,615
Ms. Min!

353
00:28:23,788 --> 00:28:25,206
Who are you?

354
00:28:26,207 --> 00:28:28,710
Ms. Min, can't you recognize me?

355
00:28:29,294 --> 00:28:31,588
I'm Ji-hun's mom.

356
00:28:34,757 --> 00:28:36,676
Oh, my goodness. Right.

357
00:28:37,177 --> 00:28:39,554
It's so nice to run into you here.

358
00:28:40,346 --> 00:28:41,431
My gosh.

359
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,059
I guess things worked out well for you.

360
00:28:45,727 --> 00:28:46,978
How have you been?

361
00:28:47,729 --> 00:28:49,314
Do you still live in that house?

362
00:28:50,899 --> 00:28:52,609
Oh, I guess you haven't heard the news.

363
00:28:52,692 --> 00:28:54,819
We moved away when Sin-jae
was in middle school.

364
00:28:56,905 --> 00:28:57,906
To be honest...

365
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:02,410
I do housekeeping in this neighborhood.

366
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:11,211
Ms. Min, let's have a meal together.

367
00:29:13,796 --> 00:29:14,839
A meal?

368
00:29:15,381 --> 00:29:18,927
We ran into each other by coincidence.
We should talk for a bit.

369
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,388
Ms. Min, get in.

370
00:29:22,889 --> 00:29:24,641
Oh, right...

371
00:29:39,781 --> 00:29:40,698
It's amazing

372
00:29:41,824 --> 00:29:43,451
how we ran into each other there.

373
00:29:44,118 --> 00:29:46,955
Do you remember Jong-hun's family?
The bank president.

374
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,164
I work there.

375
00:29:49,207 --> 00:29:51,709
I didn't know if I could do it,

376
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:53,962
but I think I made a good choice.

377
00:29:54,045 --> 00:29:55,964
I'm helping Sin-jae out, too.

378
00:29:59,384 --> 00:30:02,387
The hospital fees must be overwhelming.

379
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,346
What?

380
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:07,725
Oh, no. Sin-jae woke up. He's healthy now.

381
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:10,228
I guess you didn't hear the news
since then.

382
00:30:13,815 --> 00:30:14,983
He regained consciousness?

383
00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:18,152
Yes. One year after the accident.
It was a miracle!

384
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,532
We moved away because my husband's
business failed.

385
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,706
Look.

386
00:30:30,582 --> 00:30:32,500
Sin-jae became a cop.

387
00:30:33,543 --> 00:30:36,963
Nobody would believe me now if I tell
them he was hospitalized like that.

388
00:30:48,141 --> 00:30:51,269
Come to think of it, Ji-hun
and Sin-jae were the same age, right?

389
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:52,770
How is Ji-hun?

390
00:30:56,107 --> 00:30:57,233
Ms. Min.

391
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,820
It was so nice to see you today.

392
00:31:02,822 --> 00:31:04,782
I thought of you sometimes.

393
00:31:06,618 --> 00:31:08,786
You were really kind to me,

394
00:31:10,371 --> 00:31:11,623
so I was grateful.

395
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:18,046
Here.

396
00:31:19,547 --> 00:31:22,550
Buy yourself something delicious.

397
00:31:23,635 --> 00:31:24,927
Oh, my goodness.

398
00:31:27,388 --> 00:31:28,306
I'll be off now.

399
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:30,642
Oh, gosh. Wait.

400
00:31:31,476 --> 00:31:32,685
Hang on!

401
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,604
My gosh.

402
00:31:35,188 --> 00:31:36,689
Wait!

403
00:31:38,316 --> 00:31:39,567
What did she...

404
00:31:39,651 --> 00:31:41,486
My goodness.

405
00:31:58,419 --> 00:31:59,545
Which floor are you going to?

406
00:32:00,838 --> 00:32:01,798
The same floor.

407
00:32:20,692 --> 00:32:21,567
That jerk.

408
00:32:22,068 --> 00:32:24,362
You said you were almost here
a long time ago.

409
00:32:24,445 --> 00:32:25,488
But you're not here.

410
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:27,615
Hurry up!

411
00:32:28,908 --> 00:32:30,159
Carry her on your back.

412
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:39,127
The guards are to wait here.

413
00:32:44,966 --> 00:32:46,050
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

414
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:50,513
I was worried.

415
00:32:51,097 --> 00:32:53,182
I heard you took
a guard with you somewhere.

416
00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:54,559
Why didn't you pick up?

417
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:57,812
I didn't even have the chance.

418
00:32:58,104 --> 00:33:00,314
That man's phone was ringing
like a thousand times.

419
00:33:00,732 --> 00:33:03,484
I brought a guard with me
so you wouldn't worry so much.

420
00:33:04,694 --> 00:33:07,155
Let's go somewhere quiet, though.

421
00:33:07,947 --> 00:33:09,198
I have something to tell you.

422
00:33:12,076 --> 00:33:14,912
I think I'm about to
find Lee Lim's bamboo forest.

423
00:33:20,168 --> 00:33:22,462
I remembered something about that day,

424
00:33:22,795 --> 00:33:24,964
and I found the forest where I woke up.

425
00:33:25,256 --> 00:33:28,760
The Jangmi in this world is going to
look for a bamboo forest nearby.

426
00:33:29,177 --> 00:33:31,929
If we find it,
you just have to keep watch there.

427
00:33:38,352 --> 00:33:39,520
What is it?

428
00:33:39,687 --> 00:33:40,605
Am I wrong?

429
00:33:41,189 --> 00:33:42,648
The moment that door opens,

430
00:33:44,317 --> 00:33:45,401
time stops.

431
00:33:49,697 --> 00:33:50,865
<i>And it stops</i>

432
00:33:52,617 --> 00:33:54,452
<i>for a longer time each time it opens.</i>

433
00:33:56,496 --> 00:33:58,831
Now, time stops for over an hour.

434
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,088
So if you keep men there,
they'll be in danger.

435
00:34:07,006 --> 00:34:08,633
Since only Lee Lim would be moving.

436
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:12,595
Right.

437
00:34:12,762 --> 00:34:14,514
I guess you would've
thought of that already.

438
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:20,394
Time really stops for that long?

439
00:34:32,532 --> 00:34:36,202
Then you'd be alone during that time.

440
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,334
You were with me

441
00:34:44,669 --> 00:34:46,254
a couple of times when that happened.

442
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:50,049
Is there even a way for us

443
00:34:51,467 --> 00:34:53,094
to fix this?

444
00:34:57,223 --> 00:35:00,768
I think time is stopping because
the Manpasikjeok is broken in half.

445
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:05,147
Only half its power is being used,
so the dimensions are falling apart.

446
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,525
Maybe

447
00:35:08,651 --> 00:35:09,777
if it's whole again,

448
00:35:10,653 --> 00:35:12,071
things might get better.

449
00:35:14,407 --> 00:35:16,200
How would it be whole again?

450
00:35:17,827 --> 00:35:19,704
I guess it'll be either of the two things.

451
00:35:20,371 --> 00:35:21,998
You take the piece Lee Lim has,

452
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:25,001
or he takes your piece.

453
00:35:25,084 --> 00:35:29,171
Or if I stop Lee Lim before he takes
half of the Manpasikjeok.

454
00:35:31,299 --> 00:35:33,050
But that's in the past.

455
00:35:33,134 --> 00:35:36,095
If there's a time axis in there
as well as a space axis,

456
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,639
then it'll be possible.

457
00:35:39,056 --> 00:35:43,019
It'll explain how I got your ID card
25 years ago.

458
00:35:44,687 --> 00:35:45,897
Does it exist?

459
00:35:46,105 --> 00:35:47,273
I'm not sure yet.

460
00:35:48,566 --> 00:35:50,276
<i>I've ridden across that place,</i>

461
00:35:51,235 --> 00:35:53,529
<i>but no matter how long I rode,
I couldn't reach the edge.</i>

462
00:35:54,822 --> 00:35:58,117
I'm sure about one thing, though.
I tossed a coin in the air,

463
00:35:59,035 --> 00:36:00,036
and it floated.

464
00:36:00,995 --> 00:36:02,830
Your seeds sank in there.

465
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,459
I think living things sink.

466
00:36:09,253 --> 00:36:10,171
Really?

467
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:15,968
I bought more flower seeds today.

468
00:36:16,052 --> 00:36:18,220
MAGIC LILY

469
00:36:22,934 --> 00:36:24,101
Do you really believe

470
00:36:25,144 --> 00:36:26,812
that flowers will bloom there?

471
00:36:30,191 --> 00:36:31,692
I know what you're concerned about.

472
00:36:33,069 --> 00:36:34,612
If the Manpasikjeok becomes one,

473
00:36:35,321 --> 00:36:38,449
that door might close forever.

474
00:36:39,909 --> 00:36:41,160
Right?

475
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:45,122
This is the 10th rule out of the 17.

476
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:47,333
Don't get scared in advance.

477
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:50,586
It hasn't even happened yet.

478
00:36:59,345 --> 00:37:00,304
You're right.

479
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:03,891
But it's the 9th out of the 17.

480
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:06,602
Oh, it's the ninth?

481
00:37:07,812 --> 00:37:11,148
You say it as if you've followed
the first eight rules.

482
00:37:12,483 --> 00:37:14,944
In this situation, you should just
give me a pat...

483
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,364
Never mind. I'll see you at dawn.

484
00:37:22,618 --> 00:37:23,828
Guards, take one step forward.

485
00:37:31,502 --> 00:37:32,628
We should see dawn breaking together.

486
00:37:33,671 --> 00:37:36,007
What kind of boyfriend says that
to stay with his girlfriend?

487
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,425
What else would I say, then?

488
00:37:37,508 --> 00:37:38,843
You should say it with sincerity.

489
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:41,137
I guess I said it with something else.

490
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,263
What did you say it with?

491
00:37:42,346 --> 00:37:43,305
With impatience.

492
00:38:20,009 --> 00:38:20,843
Wow.

493
00:38:35,816 --> 00:38:37,234
Damn it, bring your own next time.

494
00:38:37,318 --> 00:38:38,819
You're being so cheap.

495
00:38:39,195 --> 00:38:40,362
Damn it.

496
00:38:44,033 --> 00:38:44,909
Gosh.

497
00:38:45,493 --> 00:38:46,869
Hey, kids!

498
00:38:47,036 --> 00:38:48,162
You can't smoke here.

499
00:38:49,205 --> 00:38:52,958
How can you do such an awful thing
in broad daylight?

500
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:55,002
Should we smoke somewhere else, then?

501
00:38:56,796 --> 00:38:59,965
When an adult says that,
it means you should stop.

502
00:39:00,549 --> 00:39:01,759
Or I'll make you stop myself.

503
00:39:04,136 --> 00:39:05,179
Why don't you try?

504
00:39:13,562 --> 00:39:16,816
I can tell by your faces that you'll
become gangsters or cops.

505
00:39:18,109 --> 00:39:19,985
Here, take these.

506
00:39:25,074 --> 00:39:28,244
MANY COPS LEARNED HERE
AT HERO TAEKWONDO CENTER

507
00:39:28,828 --> 00:39:31,372
-Don't be ridiculous. You're lying.
-He's not lying.

508
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,626
Did you get off work already?

509
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,213
Dad.

510
00:39:42,967 --> 00:39:44,051
Dad.

511
00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:47,221
I almost got killed this time.

512
00:39:48,222 --> 00:39:50,724
You were worried this time
when I didn't come home, weren't you?

513
00:39:51,684 --> 00:39:53,435
But you were home every day.

514
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:55,104
You even messaged me often.

515
00:39:56,397 --> 00:39:57,606
Are you drunk?

516
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,750
What? What is it?

517
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:18,502
Give me your phone.

518
00:40:18,586 --> 00:40:19,628
Why?

519
00:40:22,756 --> 00:40:23,924
What's going on?

520
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,143
Didn't Lee Gon give you any money?

521
00:40:34,727 --> 00:40:36,353
Why are you mooching off a civil servant?

522
00:40:38,647 --> 00:40:40,274
I learned about this
from Lieutenant Jeong.

523
00:40:40,441 --> 00:40:41,734
This is really nice.

524
00:40:46,614 --> 00:40:47,448
But...

525
00:40:50,868 --> 00:40:52,661
KIM GI-HWAN, KANG HYEON-MIN

526
00:40:52,745 --> 00:40:54,288
KANG HYEON-MIN

527
00:40:56,207 --> 00:40:57,458
Who is Kang Hyeon-min?

528
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,963
Is it okay to drink when you got shot?

529
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:08,219
I get hurt when I protect people,
and I protect people when I get hurt.

530
00:41:08,844 --> 00:41:09,678
You're so cocky.

531
00:41:09,762 --> 00:41:11,680
That's how you should fight every battle.

532
00:41:12,932 --> 00:41:14,475
And you still haven't answered me.

533
00:41:16,227 --> 00:41:20,481
Was your name Kang Hyeon-min
in the Kingdom of Corea?

534
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:27,154
Yes, I think so.

535
00:41:28,447 --> 00:41:29,740
Will you look it up for me?

536
00:41:32,493 --> 00:41:34,036
Is there anything else you want to know?

537
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:37,748
Or anything you want to find.

538
00:41:46,048 --> 00:41:47,049
Like your mother.

539
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:51,387
Anyone.

540
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:54,098
My mother, or my siblings.

541
00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:57,559
-Is that why you wanted to see me?
-Why aren't you telling her?

542
00:42:00,229 --> 00:42:02,022
You have feelings for Lieutenant Jeong.

543
00:42:03,107 --> 00:42:05,025
I'm sure you know when even I know it.

544
00:42:10,114 --> 00:42:11,699
I guess this is why you get shot.

545
00:42:12,408 --> 00:42:13,575
I'll shoot you too next time.

546
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:17,955
His Majesty and Lieutenant Jeong
can't be together.

547
00:42:19,498 --> 00:42:21,041
The two worlds are too far apart.

548
00:42:25,421 --> 00:42:27,172
That's more the reason
for you to keep quiet.

549
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:31,427
There are people more distant
than that even in the same world.

550
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:34,888
If you leave like that,
you're confirming it.

551
00:42:38,642 --> 00:42:40,436
Yes, it's true.

552
00:43:08,422 --> 00:43:10,257
What are you doing here
when you're on vacation?

553
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:14,011
Why won't you answer your phone?
What have you been up to?

554
00:43:22,936 --> 00:43:24,229
How did you get here?

555
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:32,196
Are you okay? Are you sick?

556
00:43:41,372 --> 00:43:42,414
What did you just...

557
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:49,505
It's my dad. Hang on.

558
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:12,111
Sin-jae!

559
00:44:13,529 --> 00:44:14,571
There you are.

560
00:44:15,823 --> 00:44:17,908
My cell phone's location
is around here somewhere.

561
00:44:19,576 --> 00:44:20,411
Tae-eul.

562
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:26,375
Did you...

563
00:44:30,504 --> 00:44:31,380
You saw her, right?

564
00:44:32,131 --> 00:44:34,758
Me. I mean, my counterpart.

565
00:44:35,801 --> 00:44:36,969
Did you meet her?

566
00:44:38,554 --> 00:44:40,013
Did you arrive just now?

567
00:44:40,514 --> 00:44:41,807
Yes.

568
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,354
Is it true? Does she look exactly like me?

569
00:44:51,692 --> 00:44:53,193
She even has my cell phone.

570
00:44:54,611 --> 00:44:57,114
And she must have your ID card, too.
She applied for a vacation.

571
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,242
Go to the station first
and cancel your vacation.

572
00:45:12,296 --> 00:45:15,340
So that's where the ID card is.

573
00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:25,184
She's picking up?

574
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:29,146
You know who I am, don't you?

575
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,106
<i>Of course.</i>

576
00:45:32,441 --> 00:45:34,610
<i>Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.</i>

577
00:45:37,112 --> 00:45:39,698
Where are you now?
We should see each other.

578
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:41,825
You came here to see me.

579
00:45:42,576 --> 00:45:43,785
You shouldn't say such a thing.

580
00:45:45,412 --> 00:45:47,623
If you see me now, you die.

581
00:45:48,707 --> 00:45:50,876
Be grateful you didn't run into me.

582
00:45:52,377 --> 00:45:54,129
If you ever touch anyone around me--

583
00:45:54,213 --> 00:45:57,716
If I was planning on that,
I would've done it while you were away.

584
00:45:58,759 --> 00:46:00,636
I came here to see you. I'll see you soon.

585
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:01,970
Thanks for the phone.

586
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:11,396
<i>The number you have dialed is currently--</i>

587
00:46:14,691 --> 00:46:16,235
So it's me you're after.

588
00:46:19,905 --> 00:46:23,075
Even her voice was exactly
the same as mine, though.

589
00:46:27,871 --> 00:46:28,956
Have you been well?

590
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:32,292
Did you eat well?

591
00:46:33,126 --> 00:46:34,086
Did nothing happen?

592
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:37,381
Did you run into Prime Minister Koo?

593
00:46:39,424 --> 00:46:40,884
How did you know that?

594
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:44,429
I saw that she had the same scar

595
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:46,723
that I have on my shoulder.

596
00:46:48,392 --> 00:46:49,726
But don't worry about her.

597
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:51,895
She'll never be able to go
where she wants.

598
00:46:53,397 --> 00:46:57,818
I've only tied her down but
she'll feel as if she's lost her wings.

599
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,947
It's been six years, Your Majesty.

600
00:47:02,531 --> 00:47:03,699
Have you been well?

601
00:47:04,783 --> 00:47:05,659
I remember you.

602
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:08,912
We met
at the former Prime Minister's office.

603
00:47:10,038 --> 00:47:12,666
I see you're here today as
Chairman Choe's representative.

604
00:47:12,749 --> 00:47:17,546
People call me a lobbyist,
but I call myself a laborer.

605
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,507
I get dirt on my hands
so that the higher-ups

606
00:47:21,049 --> 00:47:22,801
don't get their hands dirty.

607
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:27,431
And you can use me for that this time.

608
00:47:28,432 --> 00:47:29,433
Shall I?

609
00:47:30,434 --> 00:47:32,060
Let's hear Chairman Choe's decision first.

610
00:47:32,185 --> 00:47:35,105
Chairman Choe always puts
his company first.

611
00:47:36,982 --> 00:47:39,610
He gave plenty of alimony to his ex-wife.

612
00:47:45,532 --> 00:47:46,825
This is Chairman Choe's answer.

613
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:57,419
It's treason, Your Majesty.

614
00:48:01,214 --> 00:48:04,092
I expected it, but KU really has it all.

615
00:48:04,509 --> 00:48:07,054
But what's more shocking
is that the evidence

616
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:09,598
came from her private residence.

617
00:48:11,308 --> 00:48:13,268
You should increase security
in the palace.

618
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:17,064
Your voice was recorded often, too.

619
00:48:17,648 --> 00:48:20,942
You said you can never be indebted to her.

620
00:48:24,529 --> 00:48:26,156
I guess I didn't know her that well.

621
00:48:26,907 --> 00:48:27,783
<i>Breaking news.</i>

622
00:48:27,866 --> 00:48:31,078
<i>SBC has just received a voice recording of
KU Group's chairman,</i>

623
00:48:31,161 --> 00:48:33,705
<i>Choe Min-heon, and his ex-wife,</i>

624
00:48:33,789 --> 00:48:36,083
<i>Prime Minister Koo Seo-ryeong.</i>

625
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:38,168
<i>Let's hear the file first.</i>

626
00:48:38,418 --> 00:48:42,005
<i>Find the ones who participated
in the treason 25 years ago.</i>

627
00:48:42,964 --> 00:48:45,801
<i>If rumors spread about me trying
to catch those traitors</i>

628
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:49,346
<i>a year before my term ends,
I'll be finished.</i>

629
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:52,641
<i>All the videos of the scene
are completely gone.</i>

630
00:48:52,974 --> 00:48:54,768
<i>Even from foreign servers.</i>

631
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:56,895
<i>Can KU find them?</i>

632
00:48:57,312 --> 00:48:59,481
<i>Is your secretary's office
actually that capable?</i>

633
00:49:08,699 --> 00:49:14,037
THE CHAIRMAN OF KU SAVES THE COMPANY
BY EXPOSING HIS EX-WIFE

634
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:19,084
You can't, Deputy Prime Minister.
Let me talk to her first!

635
00:49:24,172 --> 00:49:27,092
Prime Minister Koo, you are to cease
all duties from this moment on.

636
00:49:27,592 --> 00:49:29,219
And while you're excluded
from your duties,

637
00:49:29,636 --> 00:49:32,180
I will work in your place
as Deputy Prime Minister.

638
00:49:32,764 --> 00:49:34,349
Please return your business phone.

639
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:37,102
And put your belongings in this box.

640
00:49:37,686 --> 00:49:38,979
Who gave the order?

641
00:49:41,898 --> 00:49:44,109
KU? Or the opposition party?

642
00:49:46,236 --> 00:49:47,320
The Royal Court?

643
00:49:51,116 --> 00:49:52,993
Were all of you this close?

644
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:56,037
-Hand it to me.
-It's fine.

645
00:49:56,621 --> 00:49:57,539
I have nothing to take.

646
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:00,375
Here.

647
00:50:02,627 --> 00:50:03,587
I only need this.

648
00:50:15,223 --> 00:50:16,266
Aren't you coming?

649
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:19,186
My place is always here.

650
00:50:25,901 --> 00:50:29,821
I knew men were just all talk
about being loyal,

651
00:50:31,573 --> 00:50:32,741
but you really are ridiculous.

652
00:50:35,118 --> 00:50:37,454
Who went through
my private residence, and when?

653
00:50:39,122 --> 00:50:40,457
You've spilled the milk.

654
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:42,209
You should be the one

655
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,503
to clean it up.

656
00:50:46,046 --> 00:50:46,963
Fine.

657
00:50:49,049 --> 00:50:51,176
Stay in your place
for as long as you like.

658
00:50:52,969 --> 00:50:54,971
I never stayed in my place.

659
00:50:56,139 --> 00:50:57,474
I was always soaring higher.

660
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:01,311
Let's go.

661
00:51:05,899 --> 00:51:07,526
Are you going to ignore me, too?

662
00:51:09,736 --> 00:51:11,530
No. Let's go.

663
00:51:19,454 --> 00:51:21,456
<i>Prime Minister Koo penetrated
the palace security.</i>

664
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:27,087
You can ask her how yourself.
I don't even want to talk about it.

665
00:51:32,467 --> 00:51:33,844
This place still has the best food.

666
00:51:35,178 --> 00:51:38,223
By the way, how did you know I was here?

667
00:51:39,558 --> 00:51:41,768
Did you install a tracking app
on Eun-sup's phone?

668
00:51:41,852 --> 00:51:43,478
No, Eun-sup downloaded it on my phone.

669
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:46,189
Did Eun-sup's siblings
find out you weren't him?

670
00:51:49,609 --> 00:51:50,735
Of course not.

671
00:51:55,282 --> 00:51:56,116
Eun-bi.

672
00:51:57,284 --> 00:51:58,618
Did you know that Eun-sup's
got a driver's license?

673
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:01,121
That guy isn't my brother.

674
00:52:01,204 --> 00:52:03,623
Right? It's strange, right?

675
00:52:04,207 --> 00:52:05,959
Of course, you'd notice.

676
00:52:06,543 --> 00:52:08,545
Eun-bi, listen.

677
00:52:10,088 --> 00:52:11,131
Eun-sup!

678
00:52:11,715 --> 00:52:14,301
My little puppies! Hey!

679
00:52:15,802 --> 00:52:17,262
She just said he wasn't her brother.

680
00:52:17,387 --> 00:52:18,221
Hey, Eun-bi!

681
00:52:19,055 --> 00:52:20,515
You just said he wasn't your brother.

682
00:52:21,016 --> 00:52:22,767
This one is.

683
00:52:23,268 --> 00:52:24,144
What do you mean?

684
00:52:24,811 --> 00:52:25,729
Why is he...

685
00:52:28,023 --> 00:52:29,316
It feels like he is.

686
00:52:29,399 --> 00:52:33,153
Na-ri, it seems like you really missed me.

687
00:52:34,154 --> 00:52:37,198
I really missed you!

688
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:40,076
Didn't you see me yesterday?

689
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,329
What are you doing?
There are kids watching.

690
00:52:45,624 --> 00:52:49,210
All the reasons for not trading places
with him are here.

691
00:52:50,503 --> 00:52:52,005
Come here!

692
00:52:53,757 --> 00:52:54,758
Who

693
00:52:55,383 --> 00:52:56,843
would be so brave

694
00:52:57,594 --> 00:52:59,179
as to steal a cop's phone?

695
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:04,225
Are you sure it was stolen?
Service was canceled just now.

696
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:05,143
Canceled?

697
00:53:05,226 --> 00:53:08,271
Yes, it says you canceled
the service yourself.

698
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:12,108
Gosh, that means I can't even
use my phone now.

699
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:13,860
I'll be off, then.

700
00:53:14,903 --> 00:53:16,988
I need to get a new phone.

701
00:53:20,992 --> 00:53:21,826
Cheer up.

702
00:53:23,536 --> 00:53:26,373
04D 7283

703
00:54:21,845 --> 00:54:22,887
I thought it was Na-ri.

704
00:54:23,763 --> 00:54:26,516
What? Did you miss me already?

705
00:54:30,812 --> 00:54:32,188
You wanted me to get the door.

706
00:54:33,273 --> 00:54:34,441
Seriously?

707
00:54:34,566 --> 00:54:36,359
Where's Yeong? Ask him to drive you.

708
00:54:36,943 --> 00:54:38,194
This is the Republic of Korea.

709
00:54:38,778 --> 00:54:40,655
I was going to buy you that company
but paperwork got in the way.

710
00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:43,116
I don't have an ID
in the Republic of Korea.

711
00:54:43,616 --> 00:54:45,285
So, I've bought you this for now.

712
00:54:45,952 --> 00:54:47,162
You can drive it yourself

713
00:54:47,704 --> 00:54:48,830
since it's yours.

714
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,374
What are you saying?

715
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:56,379
This car is mine?

716
00:54:59,382 --> 00:55:02,927
Yeong's got a driving license now.

717
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,597
I thank you

718
00:55:06,347 --> 00:55:08,516
sincerely for your service.

719
00:55:10,769 --> 00:55:11,895
Wowee.

720
00:55:12,437 --> 00:55:14,731
Is this for real?

721
00:55:15,523 --> 00:55:17,609
But...

722
00:55:18,276 --> 00:55:21,196
I don't have anything to give you
in return.

723
00:55:22,238 --> 00:55:23,198
This will do.

724
00:55:25,116 --> 00:55:27,619
I was wondering what it was
since you had it all the time.

725
00:55:29,871 --> 00:55:33,625
If you told me, I would have
brought you the whole box.

726
00:55:34,626 --> 00:55:35,794
It'll boost your stamina.

727
00:55:37,587 --> 00:55:38,630
I look forward to it.

728
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:42,467
I would love to stay and watch you drive,
but I must go now.

729
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:44,511
Take good care of the car.

730
00:55:45,345 --> 00:55:46,179
Goodbye.

731
00:55:50,141 --> 00:55:52,393
He looks so cool even when he's leaving.

732
00:55:52,936 --> 00:55:55,313
Sir, yes, sir!

733
00:55:59,109 --> 00:56:02,028
Dad, I'm going to be late today
so make sure to lock the door.

734
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:04,072
Don't open it for anyone.

735
00:56:04,155 --> 00:56:06,324
Especially for people you know.

736
00:56:06,825 --> 00:56:08,451
Are you going to work on a Sunday?

737
00:56:08,618 --> 00:56:09,494
Yes.

738
00:56:09,786 --> 00:56:13,248
I put your phone on the table,
so call me if something comes up.

739
00:56:14,374 --> 00:56:15,291
I'll call if I want to.

740
00:56:16,126 --> 00:56:17,085
Eat up.

741
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:18,545
Thank you.

742
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:34,102
Oh, the horse owner came.
It's been a while.

743
00:56:34,686 --> 00:56:36,646
So I asked him to join.

744
00:56:38,106 --> 00:56:39,399
Go on, you said you're leaving.

745
00:56:41,067 --> 00:56:42,110
Well, it's...

746
00:56:44,487 --> 00:56:47,824
Isn't that the pork I bought?

747
00:56:47,907 --> 00:56:51,035
Hey, you've been living
in my house for 30 years!

748
00:56:52,662 --> 00:56:57,333
Hey, what did you put on your face?
Your skin is glowing.

749
00:56:58,001 --> 00:56:59,294
Did you get a boyfriend?

750
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:01,796
Don't be ridiculous.

751
00:57:01,963 --> 00:57:03,214
This is my bare face...

752
00:57:08,136 --> 00:57:09,137
Yes.

753
00:57:10,388 --> 00:57:12,432
-What?
-I got a boyfriend.

754
00:57:13,683 --> 00:57:14,517
He's here.

755
00:57:14,601 --> 00:57:15,768
What?

756
00:57:27,155 --> 00:57:30,283
I wanted that announcement
to be sweet and emotional,

757
00:57:30,491 --> 00:57:31,784
but I guess it's too late now.

758
00:57:31,868 --> 00:57:34,037
But the point is the same either way.

759
00:57:34,829 --> 00:57:36,164
I like your daughter a lot.

760
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:38,791
I'm Lee Gon.

761
00:57:39,334 --> 00:57:40,543
Nice to meet you, sir.

762
00:57:43,296 --> 00:57:44,797
I'm just so startled...

763
00:57:46,883 --> 00:57:47,800
Gosh, Dad.

764
00:57:48,593 --> 00:57:49,886
The meat is all cooked.

765
00:57:50,595 --> 00:57:52,805
Right. Yes, it's all cooked.

766
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:56,059
It's hot, so the meat is cooked.

767
00:57:56,684 --> 00:57:57,852
Oh, sit back down.

768
00:57:58,561 --> 00:58:01,314
Eat up. Enjoy your food.

769
00:58:01,397 --> 00:58:02,607
Here you go.

770
00:58:05,777 --> 00:58:07,070
I guess you like wrapping stuff.

771
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:14,494
Did you bring this from my world?

772
00:58:14,827 --> 00:58:16,663
It tastes exactly like the kimchi
at the palace.

773
00:58:16,913 --> 00:58:18,373
By the way...

774
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:21,876
Well, I've been wanting to ask...

775
00:58:23,628 --> 00:58:24,837
Who really are you?

776
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:28,383
Dad.

777
00:58:29,008 --> 00:58:30,260
Can't you just tell?

778
00:58:30,927 --> 00:58:33,221
You can tell just by looking at his face.

779
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:35,098
He's a decent guy.

780
00:58:40,395 --> 00:58:42,355
I think your father was pretty shocked.

781
00:58:43,064 --> 00:58:46,818
He went through so much to raise you,
but you're seeing a guy with no identity.

782
00:58:46,901 --> 00:58:48,945
I was thinking of seeing you tonight.

783
00:58:49,654 --> 00:58:51,322
I didn't know you'd come home like that.

784
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:54,701
I have to go check where
Koo Seo-ryeong went, though.

785
00:58:56,202 --> 00:58:59,330
I thought I could end up leaving
without saying goodbye.

786
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:02,959
You're leaving today?

787
00:59:06,004 --> 00:59:06,963
Right now?

788
00:59:10,842 --> 00:59:11,718
Should I stay?

789
00:59:13,428 --> 00:59:14,595
Should I stay

790
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:17,098
just for today?

791
00:59:19,267 --> 00:59:21,352
If I stop you, will you stay?

792
00:59:23,062 --> 00:59:24,063
Are you sincere?

793
00:59:25,982 --> 00:59:27,358
I'll see you after my work's done.

794
00:59:37,201 --> 00:59:38,453
I bought this a long time ago.

795
00:59:40,538 --> 00:59:41,706
I bought it thinking

796
00:59:42,206 --> 00:59:45,168
I might use it
as an excuse to stop you from leaving.

797
00:59:48,129 --> 00:59:51,007
I just bought something
that was dark and plain.

798
00:59:51,299 --> 00:59:52,967
Something people can't recognize you with.

799
00:59:53,468 --> 00:59:55,261
You didn't seem to have plain clothes.

800
00:59:56,846 --> 00:59:58,306
They won't look plain if I wear them.

801
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,935
Thank you, it'll look good on me.

802
01:00:03,019 --> 01:00:05,063
It shouldn't look that good on you.

803
01:00:05,146 --> 01:00:06,522
I told you that's not possible.

804
01:00:14,781 --> 01:00:15,698
But this...

805
01:00:17,992 --> 01:00:19,577
It feels like I've seen this before.

806
01:00:20,078 --> 01:00:22,538
Yes, that's the kind of thing
I was going for.

807
01:00:23,247 --> 01:00:26,084
Wear it. I'll see you in it later.
And pick up when I call.

808
01:00:31,047 --> 01:00:36,219
VIOLENT CRIMES DIVISION SQUAD 3

809
01:00:46,729 --> 01:00:48,856
Sin-jae, I have a favor to ask.

810
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,691
Can you help me with something?

811
01:00:53,861 --> 01:00:54,821
Are you going to look for her?

812
01:00:55,696 --> 01:00:58,533
She'll come to me sooner or later.
But there's something more urgent.

813
01:01:01,702 --> 01:01:02,787
Ms. Koo Eun-a.

814
01:01:13,423 --> 01:01:15,258
Looks like she wasn't in
for at least four days.

815
01:01:16,259 --> 01:01:17,885
That's why we need to find her.

816
01:01:18,594 --> 01:01:21,722
There's no way Koo Seo-ryeong
would have not visited her here.

817
01:01:23,474 --> 01:01:26,227
And if she did, she wouldn't have
done nothing.

818
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,982
It must be about the fingerprints
from the 2G phone.

819
01:01:32,316 --> 01:01:33,317
Yes, this is Kang Sin-jae.

820
01:01:34,485 --> 01:01:35,319
Hey, Jangmi.

821
01:01:35,862 --> 01:01:36,946
Right.

822
01:01:37,488 --> 01:01:38,656
All right. Thank you.

823
01:01:43,786 --> 01:01:44,954
I'll head over there soon.

824
01:01:48,499 --> 01:01:49,333
Koo Eun-a

825
01:01:49,959 --> 01:01:52,503
was reported missing today.

826
01:01:55,214 --> 01:01:56,716
We got the fingerprint search results.

827
01:01:59,177 --> 01:02:00,511
He has a criminal record.

828
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:04,182
He served three years
for robbing a care home 19 years ago,

829
01:02:04,891 --> 01:02:07,101
and that care home
was the Yangsun Care Center.

830
01:02:09,854 --> 01:02:11,230
That's where Lee Seong-jae died.

831
01:02:12,273 --> 01:02:13,441
Lee Lim's counterpart.

832
01:02:14,609 --> 01:02:16,569
If Koo Seo-ryeong came here with Lee Lim,

833
01:02:16,944 --> 01:02:19,405
and if Koo Eun-a is dead
and not just missing...

834
01:02:21,574 --> 01:02:23,576
She's at Yangsun Care Center.

835
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,291
You know this person, right?

836
01:02:32,835 --> 01:02:34,128
No, I don't.

837
01:02:35,004 --> 01:02:36,464
May I take a look around, then?

838
01:02:36,714 --> 01:02:39,133
No. Do you have a warrant?

839
01:02:40,218 --> 01:02:42,261
No. You can just report me.

840
01:02:42,345 --> 01:02:44,931
What kind of care center
has so many rooms that require ID cards?

841
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:51,646
It's that, right?

842
01:02:53,564 --> 01:02:55,233
I'll borrow this. Take the even floors.

843
01:02:55,316 --> 01:02:56,400
-I'll check the odd floors.
-Okay.

844
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:22,301
Don't you have any
unfinished business here?

845
01:03:22,593 --> 01:03:23,427
No.

846
01:03:23,511 --> 01:03:25,388
My plan was to come and go
like I was never here.

847
01:03:27,098 --> 01:03:28,140
What is that?

848
01:03:30,184 --> 01:03:34,397
Someone didn't want me to
attract anyone's attention in this world.

849
01:03:42,738 --> 01:03:43,656
Your Majesty.

850
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:46,576
Would you like a drink with me?

851
01:03:49,745 --> 01:03:50,663
A drink?

852
01:03:52,039 --> 01:03:53,207
Something on your mind?

853
01:03:54,792 --> 01:03:56,002
I'll be back soon.

854
01:03:56,168 --> 01:03:57,670
There's no soju in the fridge.

855
01:03:58,254 --> 01:04:00,381
Lieutenant Jeong introduced it to me,
and it was good.

856
01:04:22,528 --> 01:04:24,488
He didn't do anything wrong.

857
01:04:25,615 --> 01:04:26,574
Please.

858
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:28,200
Please.

Everything is black.

862
01:05:13,746 --> 01:05:15,623
What? Did you forget the key?

863
01:05:21,462 --> 01:05:23,172
I didn't think you'd be here so early.

864
01:05:23,881 --> 01:05:25,424
Did you skip work?

865
01:05:26,801 --> 01:05:28,219
It's all part of my skills.

866
01:05:28,594 --> 01:05:29,553
Can I come in?

867
01:06:25,693 --> 01:06:28,738

01:07:22,541 --> 01:07:25,211
What about Jo Yeong?
It'll be nice to drink together.

870
01:07:28,214 --> 01:07:31,801
I looked up how to grow a magic lily.

871
01:07:31,884 --> 01:07:32,802
HOW TO GROW MAGIC LILY

872
01:07:32,885 --> 01:07:33,803
<i>I wanted to grow some.</i>

873
01:07:34,428 --> 01:07:37,348
But it says it's really hard to grow them.

874
01:07:38,516 --> 01:07:40,142
Do you know what that flower symbolizes?

875
01:07:44,396 --> 01:07:46,524
It's "hopeless love."

876
01:07:56,075 --> 01:07:57,493
Why are you looking at me like that?

877
01:07:58,536 --> 01:07:59,870
I thought I wouldn't be fooled,

878
01:08:02,164 --> 01:08:04,250
but I guess that face is my one weakness.

879
01:08:07,294 --> 01:08:08,671
What do you mean?

880
01:08:09,255 --> 01:08:10,673
You have a look of anxiety.

881
01:08:11,465 --> 01:08:12,883
Something that Tae-eul doesn't have.

882
01:08:13,425 --> 01:08:14,260
You're not

883
01:08:15,636 --> 01:08:16,720

01:08:35,698 --> 01:08:36,991
