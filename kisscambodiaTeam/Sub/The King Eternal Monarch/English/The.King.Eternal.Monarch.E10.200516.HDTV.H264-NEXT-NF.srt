THE KING: ETERNAL MONARCH

2
00:00:04,992 --> 00:00:07,411
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:07,495 --> 00:00:09,914
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,792
EPISODE 10

5
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,880
<i>Was it a really long dream?</i>

6
00:01:02,007 --> 00:01:04,218
It was my first time seeing
a house like that.

7
00:01:05,177 --> 00:01:08,222
A house with a gate and a sofa.

8
00:01:09,807 --> 00:01:13,310
And my mom smelled really nice.

9
00:01:14,562 --> 00:01:16,605
"I really hope Kang Hyeon-min

10
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,400
is just a dream."

11
00:01:20,151 --> 00:01:21,444
I thought to myself.

12
00:01:21,527 --> 00:01:23,362
It could really be just a dream.

13
00:01:24,947 --> 00:01:27,742
Why do you think that
Kang Hyeon-min is a memory?

14
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:29,452
I met someone.

15
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,830
Someone from that world.

16
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,752
Did they say that
they're from a different world?

17
00:01:38,335 --> 00:01:39,462
Do you think I'm delusional?

18
00:01:39,545 --> 00:01:40,921
Well, the symptoms...

19
00:01:43,257 --> 00:01:44,633
Enough about the nightmare.

20
00:01:44,717 --> 00:01:47,428
Tell me more about the beautiful dream
that you've been having.

21
00:01:49,764 --> 00:01:51,724
This is where you decided to go
for your vacation?

22
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,648
What about you?
It's not even your day off.

23
00:02:00,024 --> 00:02:01,358
Why aren't you answering my calls?

24
00:02:02,234 --> 00:02:04,278
Do you know how many days
I staked out this place?

25
00:02:06,572 --> 00:02:07,573
Good for you.

26
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,200
You have too much time to kill.

27
00:02:10,326 --> 00:02:11,494
The bill, please.

28
00:02:12,536 --> 00:02:13,662
The other day, you asked me

29
00:02:14,747 --> 00:02:15,956
how far I've gone.

30
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:18,918
It's science fiction.

31
00:02:19,877 --> 00:02:21,170
Do you want me to tell you?

32
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:23,547
Let's talk another time.
I'm still on my vacation.

33
00:02:24,256 --> 00:02:25,132
Hey.

34
00:02:29,303 --> 00:02:30,471
Lee Sang-do is alive.

35
00:02:32,723 --> 00:02:35,601
Lee Sang-do and Jang Yeon-ji
have something in common.

36
00:02:36,894 --> 00:02:38,229
They both were said

37
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:41,398
to have had two cell phones.

38
00:02:42,107 --> 00:02:43,067
Do you know why?

39
00:02:44,527 --> 00:02:48,405
There's another world where people
with the same faces as ours live.

40
00:02:49,073 --> 00:02:50,491
I've been there.

41
00:02:52,284 --> 00:02:54,662
A crime that takes place
across both worlds has been committed

42
00:02:55,704 --> 00:02:56,831
but I can't report it.

43
00:02:56,914 --> 00:02:58,499
How can I provide any evidence?

44
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:01,210
Someone has to stop this,

45
00:03:01,877 --> 00:03:03,003
but you're the only one

46
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:05,464
I can think of.

47
00:03:07,216 --> 00:03:08,050
Help me.

48
00:03:12,054 --> 00:03:14,598
That's not science fiction.
I call that a delusion.

49
00:03:15,224 --> 00:03:16,475
What "another world"?

50
00:03:16,976 --> 00:03:18,394
Get a hold of yourself, you fool.

51
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:41,417
<i>This...</i>

52
00:03:43,502 --> 00:03:44,628
makes no sense.

53
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,131
No way.

54
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:48,549
<i>That's</i>

55
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:50,801
<i>where he is, biding his time.</i>

56
00:03:52,428 --> 00:03:54,096
<i>Only ten days to the last day of the year.</i>

57
00:03:54,763 --> 00:03:56,432
<i>I have about five hours.</i>

58
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,518
<i>And another thing I missed</i>

59
00:03:59,602 --> 00:04:01,604
<i>is the only place where I can find</i>

60
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,898
<i>Lee Lim's obelisks.</i>

61
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,913
<i>When the sun goes down
over the white rapids,</i>

62
00:04:20,205 --> 00:04:24,209
<i>I shall wait by the gate.</i>

63
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,217
<i>Between the shadows of the birds
singing at dawn,</i>

64
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,970
<i>I see the world brightening up</i>

65
00:04:36,138 --> 00:04:38,057
<i>in its still calmness.</i>

66
00:05:25,187 --> 00:05:27,648
<i>With my eyes fixated on
the traveler passing by</i>

67
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:31,276
<i>at the break of dawn,</i>

68
00:05:34,446 --> 00:05:36,198
<i>"Is that you?"</i>

69
00:05:37,574 --> 00:05:39,618
<i>"Is that you?"</i>

70
00:05:42,788 --> 00:05:43,664
Hey.

71
00:05:49,962 --> 00:05:50,879
What?

72
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:53,882
You're finally here.

73
00:05:54,425 --> 00:05:55,843
Did you just get here?

74
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:27,791
Have you been waiting here?

75
00:06:31,003 --> 00:06:32,629
Are you really here?

76
00:06:34,006 --> 00:06:36,633
Not yet. Not entirely.

77
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:41,847
I missed you so much.

78
00:06:43,432 --> 00:06:44,600
I missed you like crazy,

79
00:06:46,977 --> 00:06:49,021
so I was going to just hear your voice
and leave.

80
00:06:51,315 --> 00:06:52,316
My voice?

81
00:06:54,526 --> 00:06:57,654
I was going to call you
from that pay phone over there.

82
00:07:33,816 --> 00:07:36,151
You really need to tell me now.

83
00:07:36,735 --> 00:07:38,278
Where is His Majesty?

84
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:41,615
It's the New Year's ceremony.

85
00:07:41,698 --> 00:07:45,828
You need to at least help me
come up with an excuse for his absence.

86
00:07:45,953 --> 00:07:48,914
Don't worry.
Just plan for it as we normally do.

87
00:07:49,665 --> 00:07:51,625
His Majesty will return
before Lunar New Year.

88
00:07:52,292 --> 00:07:53,293
But Lunar New Year is...

89
00:07:54,128 --> 00:07:55,838
the day after tomorrow.

90
00:07:57,673 --> 00:08:00,217
I'm on my way to an early grave
from worry.

91
00:08:06,306 --> 00:08:07,182
Your Majesty.

92
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:13,438
What's the date today?

93
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:15,023
Am I back on time?

94
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:18,318
Lunar New Year should be in a day or two.

95
00:08:18,402 --> 00:08:19,987
It's the 23rd.

96
00:08:20,988 --> 00:08:22,948
You came just in time.

97
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,160
Thank God.

98
00:08:27,161 --> 00:08:28,996
I lost count.

99
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,666
What on earth is happening?

100
00:08:34,376 --> 00:08:36,420
Your Majesty, did you have
a secret rendezvous or...

101
00:08:38,297 --> 00:08:40,132
Something amazing like that?

102
00:08:40,883 --> 00:08:42,718
It's more like illegal immigration,

103
00:08:43,594 --> 00:08:44,887
but it was quite amazing indeed.

104
00:08:45,387 --> 00:08:46,555
I'll see you tomorrow.

105
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:55,522
Here's the hotel room key.

106
00:08:56,481 --> 00:08:57,357
Thank you.

107
00:08:59,443 --> 00:09:02,112
We never even had a chance
to grab a bite together. Eat up.

108
00:09:03,822 --> 00:09:06,074
I'm going to have to leave
as soon as I finish this.

109
00:09:08,202 --> 00:09:09,494
This guy's family is coming.

110
00:09:11,496 --> 00:09:12,706
Lunar New Year is already here.

111
00:09:13,457 --> 00:09:14,917
I feel bad you have to spend
the holiday here.

112
00:09:16,126 --> 00:09:19,671
I know I'm stuck here,
but Eun-sup is in the same situation.

113
00:09:22,674 --> 00:09:25,886
Just make sure you don't get
on Eun-bi's nerves. You can't beat her.

114
00:09:26,428 --> 00:09:27,971
Don't worry about that.

115
00:09:28,722 --> 00:09:30,224
I'm worried that she's too fond of me.

116
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,768
I should get going.

117
00:09:35,062 --> 00:09:36,313
Happy New Year.

118
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:39,483
Happy New Year to you too.

119
00:10:01,713 --> 00:10:02,965
What are you doing?

120
00:10:03,924 --> 00:10:04,967
Stand straight.

121
00:10:07,594 --> 00:10:08,929
Your uncle is waiting.

122
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:11,848
Every year, you put this on just fine
all by yourself.

123
00:10:11,974 --> 00:10:12,849
<i>Every year?</i>

124
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,434
<i>This?</i>

125
00:10:15,102 --> 00:10:16,311
<i>These multicolored stripes?</i>

126
00:10:17,688 --> 00:10:18,605
What? Jeez.

127
00:10:27,531 --> 00:10:28,407
Mom.

128
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,533
Yes, what?

129
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:32,327
I've been watching him carefully.

130
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:34,079
You see, that man

131
00:10:36,623 --> 00:10:37,624
isn't Eun-sup.

132
00:10:39,501 --> 00:10:41,086
What do you mean?

133
00:10:41,586 --> 00:10:43,922
Daddy is waiting in the car.

134
00:10:44,006 --> 00:10:48,176
If you look carefully, he's changed
for the better but worse in some ways.

135
00:10:48,552 --> 00:10:49,594
What?

136
00:10:51,513 --> 00:10:53,223
He's much cooler now,

137
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:56,393
but he's also become a prick!

138
00:10:58,729 --> 00:10:59,730
Eun-sup.

139
00:11:00,397 --> 00:11:01,732
What is this?

140
00:11:02,065 --> 00:11:03,358
Hey, don't touch that.

141
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:14,369
It's a souvenir from the military.

142
00:11:16,288 --> 00:11:18,290
See? Let's call the police now.

143
00:11:19,082 --> 00:11:20,792
The entire Jo family is at stake.

144
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:24,504
He is my son.

145
00:11:25,922 --> 00:11:30,385
I gave birth to this cool guy here
for the Jo family.

146
00:11:35,682 --> 00:11:37,309
You've been discharged. Grow up, will you?

147
00:11:37,893 --> 00:11:39,811
Why are you playing with kids' toys?

148
00:11:41,355 --> 00:11:42,939
Get ready, okay?

149
00:11:59,164 --> 00:12:00,248
The Republic of Korea.

150
00:12:00,832 --> 00:12:04,002
How come a mere seven-year-old here
is sharp enough to join the Royal Guards.

151
00:12:06,963 --> 00:12:08,006
I mean,

152
00:12:09,216 --> 00:12:11,510
who works the night shift
on New Year's Day?

153
00:12:12,636 --> 00:12:16,807
This happened
because our squad has no power.

154
00:12:17,974 --> 00:12:20,811
Somebody had to do this,
so let's just be glad we got the job done.

155
00:12:21,561 --> 00:12:22,396
I like it.

156
00:12:22,854 --> 00:12:25,941
The sunrise, the coffee,
and the first night duty of the new year.

157
00:12:26,691 --> 00:12:28,318
It's what
the violent crimes unit is about.

158
00:12:29,152 --> 00:12:30,237
Hey, tell me.

159
00:12:30,904 --> 00:12:34,574
What do those three things
have to do with the violent crimes unit?

160
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,790
Everyone is looking at us.

161
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:46,002
They're like, "I was wondering who worked
the night shift on New Year's Day.

162
00:12:46,878 --> 00:12:48,004
Oh. It's them."

163
00:12:48,088 --> 00:12:49,172
-Exactly.
-Poor us.

164
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,968
No, they're looking at us because
they think we're filming a TV commercial.

165
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:55,512
This totally looks like a scene
from a TV commercial.

166
00:13:02,602 --> 00:13:04,229
Did you put something in his <i>tteokguk</i>?

167
00:13:05,814 --> 00:13:07,858
All right, guys.
You all did a great job last year.

168
00:13:07,941 --> 00:13:09,985
-Let's keep it up this year--
-Gosh, that old geezer.

169
00:13:10,068 --> 00:13:11,987
-Stop it, or I'll actually get mad.
-I like it.

170
00:13:12,112 --> 00:13:14,614
The sunrise, the coffee, sharing
pleasantries to start the year off.

171
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,158
Let's just ignore them.

172
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:17,701
I'm done. I give up.

173
00:13:18,743 --> 00:13:22,372
Hey, could that cool guy walking toward us

174
00:13:22,456 --> 00:13:23,540
be Sin-jae?

175
00:13:32,757 --> 00:13:33,633
I'm back.

176
00:13:34,426 --> 00:13:35,302
Welcome back.

177
00:13:35,635 --> 00:13:37,846
I'm glad you got some well-deserved rest.

178
00:13:38,054 --> 00:13:39,306
Let's get back to some work.

179
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:40,390
-Oh, boy.
-Yes, sir!

180
00:13:40,474 --> 00:13:41,475
Let's get some work done.

181
00:13:41,558 --> 00:13:42,851
Gosh, my legs.

182
00:13:48,273 --> 00:13:50,734
What was that about the cell phone?
I'm all ears.

183
00:13:55,447 --> 00:13:58,033
<i>Year 2020 has begun.</i>

184
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,205
Another incredible year
has been added to our lives.

185
00:14:04,831 --> 00:14:08,418
I've been thinking about the plus sign,
which is one of mathematical symbols.

186
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:13,715
It's found in hospitals' signs
and equations, and it's also a cross.

187
00:14:14,966 --> 00:14:16,676
Depending on the meaning
that is added to it,

188
00:14:17,802 --> 00:14:21,181
it can be a symbol of healing to some
and of prayer to others.

189
00:14:22,098 --> 00:14:23,433
<i>And for some people,</i>

190
00:14:24,434 --> 00:14:27,229
<i>it gives them courage to face their fate.</i>

191
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:34,819
Year 2020
is the year of the mighty white rat.

192
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,656
The rat is the first creature
in the zodiac,

193
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:41,660
and it's also
the god of direction and time.

194
00:14:44,162 --> 00:14:45,372
I'll be rooting for all of you

195
00:14:47,082 --> 00:14:49,167
every step of the way in 2020,

196
00:14:49,751 --> 00:14:51,920
and I hope every second of your time
will be fruitful.

197
00:14:55,382 --> 00:14:56,925
Happy New Year to you all.

198
00:15:00,011 --> 00:15:01,429
Wow!

199
00:15:02,097 --> 00:15:05,433
My gosh, he's so charismatic
when he's giving a speech.

200
00:15:06,017 --> 00:15:06,935
I'm at your service!

201
00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:08,645
I'm...

202
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,569
<i>What's His Majesty's type?</i>

203
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:20,073
What's with this blunt question?

204
00:15:22,117 --> 00:15:23,326
You seemed busy.

205
00:15:23,493 --> 00:15:26,121
You seem busier, Prime Minister Koo.

206
00:15:26,663 --> 00:15:28,498
You only have a year until your term ends.

207
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,751
A year is more than enough.

208
00:15:31,835 --> 00:15:35,005
Don't you know that I was married
and divorced in just a year?

209
00:15:36,256 --> 00:15:38,633
With your help,

210
00:15:38,717 --> 00:15:40,051
just half a year would be enough.

211
00:15:41,678 --> 00:15:42,721
Give me some hints.

212
00:15:43,805 --> 00:15:47,100
What can crush His Majesty's heart.

213
00:15:48,602 --> 00:15:51,271
The normal question would be,
"What makes his heart flutter?"

214
00:15:51,896 --> 00:15:54,065
Yet you are asking
what can crush his heart.

215
00:15:55,275 --> 00:15:58,403
Talk about a violent love.

216
00:15:59,696 --> 00:16:04,784
Has His Majesty ever shed tears
in front of you?

217
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:06,578
Even just once?

218
00:16:09,831 --> 00:16:13,293
That is why I refuse to help you.

219
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:16,796
That was an excellent speech,
Your Majesty.

220
00:16:17,464 --> 00:16:21,718
Will you also be rooting for me
every step of the way?

221
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:25,013
As I said before, I always have.

222
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:28,391
I hope you don't have
a bad sense of direction.

223
00:16:36,524 --> 00:16:37,400
Your Majesty,

224
00:16:38,234 --> 00:16:39,152
someone's calling.

225
00:16:39,235 --> 00:16:40,070
DETECTIVE KANG

226
00:16:40,153 --> 00:16:41,321
Then answer it.

227
00:16:41,821 --> 00:16:44,824
Lower your voice and say,
"Jo Yeong speaking."

228
00:16:49,913 --> 00:16:51,498
I love hearing it.

229
00:16:52,332 --> 00:16:55,460
Yeong looks very cool
when he answers the phone in such a voice.

230
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,298
Jo Yeong speaking.

231
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,972
Attention!

232
00:17:08,765 --> 00:17:11,184
Who is Detective Kang Jun-hyeok?

233
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:12,852
It's...

234
00:17:12,936 --> 00:17:13,895
It's me, Your Majesty!

235
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:15,480
I am Kang Jun-hyeok.

236
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,246
You're

237
00:17:32,872 --> 00:17:34,082
still alive.

238
00:17:36,251 --> 00:17:37,877
I'm borrowing your name.

239
00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:40,588
It's even on the documents now.

240
00:17:41,881 --> 00:17:43,049
I'm paying you for the name.

241
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,512
Don't let anyone chase you

242
00:17:48,304 --> 00:17:49,639
and trust no one.

243
00:17:51,307 --> 00:17:52,225
I hope

244
00:17:53,852 --> 00:17:55,103
you live a long life,

245
00:17:56,396 --> 00:17:57,439
Luna.

246
00:17:58,148 --> 00:17:59,524
<i>This girl is Luna.</i>

247
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:04,738
She was locked up until two weeks ago,
but it seems she's been released.

248
00:18:04,904 --> 00:18:05,905
Why was she released?

249
00:18:06,489 --> 00:18:09,743
She didn't complete her sentence.
She got out early.

250
00:18:10,285 --> 00:18:12,662
Apparently, she's terminally ill.

251
00:18:13,663 --> 00:18:15,123
Would you like to see her diagnosis?

252
00:18:18,626 --> 00:18:19,544
I'd like to

253
00:18:20,462 --> 00:18:22,297
meet her in person,
if that is possible at all.

254
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,215
Sure, we will find her.

255
00:18:24,507 --> 00:18:27,343
Everything about this case
should be reported directly to me.

256
00:18:27,844 --> 00:18:28,928
One more thing.

257
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:33,224
I need information on this person.

258
00:18:33,308 --> 00:18:34,684
KIM GI-HWAN
BORN NOVEMBER 23, 1968

259
00:18:39,981 --> 00:18:41,399
PERSONAL INFORMATION

260
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,277
<i>If he's dead</i>

261
00:18:45,069 --> 00:18:46,863
<i>in this world...</i>

262
00:18:46,946 --> 00:18:47,989
Yes, Your Majesty.

263
00:18:48,698 --> 00:18:50,450
He was one of the traitor's followers,

264
00:18:51,117 --> 00:18:52,660
but he died while on the run.

265
00:18:53,328 --> 00:18:54,204
He took his own life.

266
00:18:56,331 --> 00:18:57,624
<i>That means</i>

267
00:18:58,917 --> 00:19:00,835
<i>those with the same faces
are stealing the lives</i>

268
00:19:02,128 --> 00:19:03,171
<i>of their counterparts.</i>

269
00:19:03,254 --> 00:19:05,507
EVIDENCE
0631 SPECIAL LARCENY

270
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,064
DO EXACTLY AS YOU BELIEVE

271
00:19:21,689 --> 00:19:24,108
-It's snowing.
-My gosh!

272
00:19:24,776 --> 00:19:26,152
It's snowing!

273
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:06,234
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

274
00:20:08,111 --> 00:20:09,404
Happy New Year.

275
00:20:20,623 --> 00:20:21,457
<i>Lee Lim</i>

276
00:20:23,543 --> 00:20:25,628
<i>has finally returned
to the Kingdom of Corea.</i>

277
00:20:30,967 --> 00:20:31,843
Your Majesty.

278
00:20:33,803 --> 00:20:35,722
Did you see anyone pass by just now?

279
00:20:35,805 --> 00:20:36,639
No, I didn't.

280
00:20:36,723 --> 00:20:37,932
No one, so far?

281
00:20:38,016 --> 00:20:41,185
Correct. We've been on rotating shifts
for 17 days but haven't spotted anyone.

282
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,481
<i>What is it that I'm missing here?</i>

283
00:20:46,941 --> 00:20:49,235
<i>Had guarding this bamboo forest
been enough,</i>

284
00:20:49,861 --> 00:20:50,987
<i>we would have already met.</i>

285
00:20:52,238 --> 00:20:54,324
He, too, would have had
his guards on the other side.

286
00:20:56,743 --> 00:20:57,869
<i>Our gateways</i>

287
00:20:59,454 --> 00:21:00,580
<i>are different.</i>

288
00:21:01,581 --> 00:21:02,707
This was a waste of time.

289
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,293
Your Majesty, with all due respect--

290
00:21:05,376 --> 00:21:08,630
Is there a shortcut from here to Haeundae
that doesn't pass through the palace?

291
00:21:08,713 --> 00:21:11,299
The path under Point Seven
is a farm road that is no longer in use.

292
00:21:11,382 --> 00:21:12,216
That's plan B.

293
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,594
All Royal Guards to Haeundae now.

294
00:21:14,677 --> 00:21:16,095
We're pulling out of here at once.

295
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:17,096
Yes, Your Majesty!

296
00:21:21,476 --> 00:21:22,310
Yes, Your Majesty.

297
00:21:23,436 --> 00:21:24,604
Yes, it's ready.

298
00:21:25,396 --> 00:21:27,941
We just need to post it
on our social media pages.

299
00:21:29,943 --> 00:21:30,818
Yes, Your Majesty.

300
00:21:31,861 --> 00:21:33,404
-Is the event notice going up?
-Yes.

301
00:21:33,488 --> 00:21:34,614
What's going on?

302
00:21:34,697 --> 00:21:37,742
His Majesty planned an event and is going
all the way to Haeundae for it?

303
00:21:37,825 --> 00:21:40,495
His Majesty needed to invite someone.

304
00:21:41,329 --> 00:21:42,872
Right, exactly. What does that mean?

305
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:46,292
My gosh, His Majesty is coming
to Haeundae!

306
00:21:51,506 --> 00:21:53,466
NEW YEAR'S MOONLIGHT WALK WITH THE KING

307
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:54,425
When is he coming?

308
00:23:26,517 --> 00:23:27,643
Traitor

309
00:23:30,229 --> 00:23:31,189
Lee Lim!

310
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,370
<i>Do you remember my voice?</i>

311
00:23:49,082 --> 00:23:50,374
<i>I remember yours.</i>

312
00:23:52,001 --> 00:23:54,003
Yes, my dear nephew. It's me.

313
00:23:55,296 --> 00:23:56,506
How have you been?

314
00:23:58,925 --> 00:23:59,801
You are

315
00:24:03,262 --> 00:24:04,388
actually alive.

316
00:24:05,807 --> 00:24:06,724
Yes.

317
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:10,061
And I have been waiting for this day,
my dear nephew.

318
00:24:11,938 --> 00:24:14,440
Since missing the opportunity
I had been waiting for all my life,

319
00:24:15,733 --> 00:24:18,069
I've waited while living a different life.

320
00:24:22,323 --> 00:24:23,699
Wait just a little longer.

321
00:24:25,952 --> 00:24:27,036
I will

322
00:24:28,996 --> 00:24:30,206
find you at all costs.

323
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:34,836
This is the first time I'm hearing you
talking like a king, my dear nephew.

324
00:24:36,629 --> 00:24:37,839
<i>Please do find me.</i>

325
00:24:39,006 --> 00:24:40,842
You told the world that I died.

326
00:24:43,302 --> 00:24:45,388
So now, bring this dead man back to life.

327
00:24:47,723 --> 00:24:49,350
<i>I am very much looking forward to</i>

328
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:53,312
<i>the chaos it will cause.</i>

329
00:25:35,229 --> 00:25:38,399
He is one of the traitor's followers.
Get him!

330
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:58,127
Hold your fire.

331
00:26:02,757 --> 00:26:04,175
Hold your fire!

332
00:26:04,258 --> 00:26:05,885
The safety of the people comes first!

333
00:26:08,471 --> 00:26:09,430
Captain!

334
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:45,466
Inform the police
and transport the injured first.

335
00:26:46,133 --> 00:26:46,968
Yes, Your Majesty.

336
00:26:48,052 --> 00:26:50,137
All Royal Guards
except for a few that you can spare,

337
00:26:50,471 --> 00:26:52,348
must protect the people
until the police arrive.

338
00:26:52,431 --> 00:26:53,724
Then those bastards--

339
00:26:53,808 --> 00:26:55,601
No, we won't chase them.

340
00:26:56,102 --> 00:26:57,561
No more casualties.

341
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:03,234
Collect CCTV footage from all the cameras
within a one-kilometer radius immediately.

342
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:05,444
If any videos of the scene get posted,

343
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:09,073
they must be taken down at all costs.

344
00:27:09,573 --> 00:27:10,783
Yes, Your Majesty!

345
00:27:17,707 --> 00:27:18,541
Eun-sup.

346
00:27:20,418 --> 00:27:21,502
Wake up.

347
00:27:22,962 --> 00:27:23,879
Jo Eun-sup.

348
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:27,604
A shoot-out?

349
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:31,566
Yes. His Majesty is okay,
but Captain Jo got hurt.

350
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,403
That is not what I'm asking.

351
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:38,407
What's this trending keyword about?
"Traitor Lee Lim." Is this true?

352
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,408
Oh, that...

353
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,576
Stories about seeing him
keep getting posted,

354
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,786
but there's no evidence yet.

355
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,163
Most believe that it's just a conspiracy.

356
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,792
He looked just like Lee Lim
when he was alive.

357
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:51,920
What's going on?

358
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,215
What on earth is happening?

359
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,719
Secure any photos or videos of the scene
as soon as possible

360
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:00,679
and call the palace.

361
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:01,805
Yes, ma'am.

362
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,310
Is His Majesty

363
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,397
an honest person?

364
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,662
What? Lee Lim?

365
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:26,788
The traitor Lee Lim?

366
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:27,831
What's going on?

367
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,083
My gosh! Look what happened in Busan.

368
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,752
What? A shoot-out?

369
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:34,546
Lee Lim, the traitor?

370
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,006
Lee Lim is alive?

371
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,382
What the heck is going on?

372
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:38,508
So he's actually alive?

373
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:39,759
I guess so.

374
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:44,639
Your Highness, the security level
for you has been elevated to level one.

375
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,933
What is going on? A shoot-out?

376
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,685
What are they talking about?

377
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:54,649
Thanks to his bulletproof vest, he hasn't
suffered any fractures or organ damage,

378
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,319
but I see some torn muscles and ligaments,

379
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:01,114
so we'll keep him here for about two weeks
and see how he recovers.

380
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,158
What about the other two?

381
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,160
We've sealed their wounds.

382
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,706
Are you really okay, Your Majesty?

383
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,710
Head Court Lady Noh keeps calling us
every five minutes.

384
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:16,129
Yes, I'm fine.

385
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:20,592
Please just take good care of them.

386
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,386
Please take special care of these men.

387
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,055
Talk soon.

388
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,237
I will take my leave.

389
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:47,619
Why don't you taste that canned peach
for me if you're that worried?

390
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,663
Are you really okay?

391
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,790
That was a real gun.

392
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:53,708
You could've died.

393
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,377
What was I supposed to do?

394
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,589
Yeong told me to protect Your Majesty
at all costs.

395
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,176
He said he'll do the same for my siblings.

396
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,390
Well, you now agree

397
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,477
that I deserve the title of
the Unbreakable Sword, right?

398
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,481
Yes, most definitely.

399
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:19,776
Thank you

400
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,736
for protecting me.

401
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,596
NOTICE
DO NOT ENTER

402
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:00,692
Are you all right?

403
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,570
The country is in an uproar.

404
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,614
The police and Royal Guards
must be after you.

405
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,573
After whom?

406
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,284
A 70-year-old man?

407
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,243
Or a man

408
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:13,079
who was shot to death 25 years ago?

409
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:21,338
Today, my dear nephew must've realized
the weight of his own words

410
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:26,176
down to the bone.

411
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,386
Still, you should be careful.

412
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,221
Prince Buyeong visited the store.

413
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,351
Did he recognize you?

414
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,977
No, I don't think so.

415
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:37,771
I think it was a coincidence.

416
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:47,947
Most things that seem like coincidences
are actually meant to be,

417
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,618
and anything that was meant to be
is called destiny.

418
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,579
But don't worry.

419
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,831
Goodwill is always useless,

420
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,085
and its destiny is powerless.

421
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,798
I am looking forward to

422
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,717
the next time he and I will cross paths.

423
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:19,270
28 19GA-GIL DONGIL-RO JUNGNANG-GU

424
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,693
Who? Who did you see? Ji-hun's mom?

425
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,570
The woman who used to work
for my family as a housekeeper?

426
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,407
<i>Yes, her. I didn't recognize her at first.</i>

427
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,534
<i>She looked like a different person.</i>

428
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,036
Gosh, they say you never know
what can happen in life.

429
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,205
Things must've worked out for her.
I'm happy for her.

430
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,206
<i>Come on.</i>

431
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,333
<i>I bet she just snatched a rich, old man.</i>

432
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,421
It could be a rich, young guy.
You never know.

433
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:48,216
Her kid was the same age as Sin-jae,

434
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,553
so I gave her
a ton of Sin-jae's old clothes.

435
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,179
That was so long ago.

436
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:55,515
Oh, right. How's your back?

437
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,839
-I thought you were coming alone.
-I thought you were both gone.

438
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,925
They came together,
but they didn't leave together.

439
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:35,263
This science fiction story needs you both.
So no objections, please. Both of you.

440
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:36,723
Okay?

441
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,777
Lee Sang-do has gone over
to the Kingdom of Corea

442
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,236
from the Republic of Korea.

443
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:54,699
And it looks like Jang Yeon-ji
is getting ready to go to the Kingdom.

444
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,245
Kim Gi-hwan came to the Republic of Korea
from the Kingdom

445
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:00,663
but has been sent back.

446
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:03,666
What they have in common
is that they all have 2G phones.

447
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,502
We haven't found Jang Yeon-ji's yet.

448
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,712
We should drop by the penitentiary first.

449
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,673
So you guys took him back to the Kingdom?

450
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,717
That's where he belongs.

451
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,762
That's not for you to decide.

452
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:18,014
If he's reported missing,
it'll turn into a headache.

453
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,058
Could we have dealt with him
with the law here?

454
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,894
You took him to bring him to justice?
What did he do?

455
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:23,895
Illegal immigration?

456
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:26,439
Doesn't the law of my country
also apply to you?

457
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,777
What are you talking about?

458
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,529
When should we visit Jang Yeon-ji?

459
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,406
Would you like something to drink,
Detective Kang?

460
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,158
I'll have some coffee.

461
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,326
Black? Or a latte?

462
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,247
Is there something
that I don't know about?

463
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:55,176
Are you hurt?

464
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,555
Is Captain Jo okay?

465
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,932
Both Yeong and I are fine.

466
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,192
By the way, is it true?

467
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:14,404
Did you really see Traitor Lee Lim?

468
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,322
I chased him.

469
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,533
I chased after him

470
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,119
but I let him get away.

471
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:22,829
Why?

472
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,539
Lee Lim looked exactly the same as he did

473
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,207
25 years ago.

474
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,126
He hasn't aged at all.

475
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,212
What? He hasn't aged?

476
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:34,507
See? I can't even convince you.

477
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,176
I can't even explain,
let alone convince you.

478
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,429
That's what he's after.

479
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,514
Returning to this world

480
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,975
as a man who doesn't age.

481
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,728
That's why I let him go.

482
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,606
So please

483
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,692
pray that I will win this fight.

484
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,320
I will win no matter what.

485
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:57,363
Your Majesty.

486
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,663
Your Majesty,
Prime Minister Koo is on the phone.

487
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,709
Here's His Majesty.

488
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,380
Prime Minister Koo.

489
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:15,965
I'm fine.

490
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,885
If you called to check up on me,
let's talk another time.

491
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,929
<i>I already heard that all is well
with Your Majesty.</i>

492
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,764
<i>I'm truly relieved.</i>

493
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,934
<i>But you must be distraught,
so I'll keep this short.</i>

494
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,393
What is it?

495
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:31,064
Conspiracy theory about
Lee Lim, the traitor has been spreading.

496
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,317
Hence, I'd like to ask you a question
out of genuine concern.

497
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,861
I trust that you'll be honest with me.

498
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,864
Was it Lee Lim?

499
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,575
Or his followers?

500
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,416
Prime Minister Koo, have you started
your horseback-riding lessons yet?

501
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,585
I beg your pardon?

502
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:56,547
The gag should act as a mediator
between the horse and the rider.

503
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,549
What I mean by that is,

504
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,636
no one should pull the gag
to change the horse's direction.

505
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,263
What happened today

506
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:07,058
was not just about the Royal Court
or me, the King.

507
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:08,893
It was an act of terrorism.

508
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:14,857
As recorded in history, Lee Lim
was shot to death a year after the coup.

509
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,859
And 25 years later,

510
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:21,114
I found some of his followers
and went after them.

511
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,450
<i>Hence, I beseech you.</i>

512
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,452
<i>Prime Minister Koo.</i>

513
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,705
Do not pull the gag.

514
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,916
Do not use the word "honesty"
as your weapon.

515
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,253
Please focus solely on protecting
the safety of the people.

516
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:37,922
That's it for now.

517
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,803
-Are you preparing the brief?
-Yes.

518
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,513
Would that summary be enough?

519
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,764
Yes, Your Majesty.

520
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,525
I'm Jo Hye-mi from Haejung Daily.

521
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,778
Rumor has it that His Majesty called a man
"Traitor Lee Lim"

522
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,655
on the night of January 25.

523
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,743
Lee Lim was supposedly shot to death.
Is there a chance that he may be alive?

524
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,663
We were asked the exact same question
25 years ago,

525
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,875
and the Royal Court's answer
remains the same today.

526
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,127
No, it's impossible.

527
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:20,381
His Majesty found
one of Lee Lim's followers.

528
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:22,675
His Majesty chased him but lost him.

529
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:27,597
Go ahead.

530
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,599
You just mentioned
the traitor's followers.

531
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:32,643
Why do you think they resurfaced?

532
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,230
As the royal court's press secretary,

533
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,109
I have no interest in their intentions.

534
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:46,074
The Royal Court's only concern is to
hunt them down and bring them to justice.

535
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:47,992
-Next.
-Here!

536
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,577
-Over here!
-Here!

537
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:54,665
A cell phone?

538
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:56,876
What do you mean?

539
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,297
A smartphone and a 2G phone.

540
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,050
You had two cell phones.

541
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,802
I don't know what you're talking about.

542
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:06,928
I'm sure you do.

543
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,476
This phone. It's yours, right?

544
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:21,400
On this phone was something
that had to be kept confidential,

545
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,195
but your friend happened to hear it.

546
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:28,616
That's why you killed her according to
what you read about in the script.

547
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:33,037
Because you were sure
that someone was going to get you out.

548
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,417
Right?

549
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:42,171
Who gave you this phone?

550
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,216
What...

551
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:49,762
Like I said, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

552
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:51,764
What do you think?

553
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:53,891
I think you're onto something.

554
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:17,331
I managed to trick her
with Lee Sang-do's phone,

555
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,001
but I wonder where Jang Yeon-ji hid hers.

556
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,173
Hey, are you listening?

557
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,469
Did you spot something outside?

558
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:34,724
What? Do you know whose car that is?

559
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:36,559
I may have seen it before.

560
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,436
I'll drive.

561
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,982
PERSONAL INFORMATION

562
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,442
VEHICLE INFORMATION

563
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,823
VEHICLE INFORMATION
VEHICLE REGISTRATION NUMBER

564
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,456
Zero.

565
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,375
If it's the car in front of
the barbecue place,

566
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,086
<i>then it's zero.</i>

567
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:07,924
Chief, you never let me down.

568
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:14,972
PENDING APPROVAL

569
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:16,724
Could you approve this?

570
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,936
Hey, why are you after that car?
What's going on?

571
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:20,937
Did something happen?

572
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,563
I'm about to find out.

573
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,650
This is Kang Sin-jae, Squad 3.

574
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,735
I requested a vehicle check.
When can it be done?

575
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,238
Okay, thank you.

576
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,242
You need a partner.

577
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,911
Hey, you should partner up with Jangmi.

578
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,746
All right, I have to step out.

579
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,456
Oh, Detective Shim.

580
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:41,415
Yes?

581
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,125
You had a drink with me last night, okay?

582
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,627
Why? You picked me, out of everyone?

583
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,545
Wait, Chief! Hold on.

584
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:47,755
Hold on a second.

585
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,715
Chief.

586
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,009
Seriously, who are you meeting?

587
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:55,513
Solitude.

588
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,641
Jeez, come on. Chief!

589
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,186
See you later, sir.

590
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,899
Did you get information on the vehicle?

591
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,818
It'll take about half an hour.

592
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,946
Order some food. I want <i>dolsot</i> bibimbap.

593
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,073
Then I'll order a steak...

594
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,827
Never mind.

595
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,788
<i>Dolsot</i> bibimbap for everyone, okay?

596
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:36,178
<i>We worked so hard to protect this nation.</i>

597
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:38,931
And we're starting the year off
with a shoot-out?

598
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,808
With the traitor's followers?

599
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,936
You see, every family needs
a strong pillar.

600
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,688
It's because we have
a woman prime minister.

601
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,149
That hen keeps on squawking
every single day.

602
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,235
No wonder even the deceased traitor's
followers are causing a scene.

603
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,488
We are truly concerned
about His Majesty's safety.

604
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,407
You saw how Park Cheol-ung suffered.

605
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,201
If this isn't a terror attack, what is?

606
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,537
Your Highness, the timing is perfect.

607
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:05,249
Just express your deep concern
as the oldest member of the Royal Family.

608
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,752
-If you just say the word--
-How insolent!

609
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:12,340
The most senior member of the Royal Family
is His Majesty, not I.

610
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:15,676
The remaining Royal Family and relatives
are to stay out of politics.

611
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,178
How many times must I tell you?

612
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,555
Get out of my house this instant!

613
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,476
Your Highness, His Majesty is here.

614
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:28,814
Your Majesty!

615
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:30,900
Your Majesty.

616
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,118
I hope I haven't caused
a misunderstanding, Your Majesty.

617
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:45,289
They barged into my house unannounced.

618
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,833
I won't get the wrong idea.

619
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,963
How's everything with Se-jin?

620
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,427
She finished her residency
and has started her fellowship.

621
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,598
She's still clumsy though.

622
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:05,768
Se-jin

623
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:07,645
will do a great job.

624
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:11,565
Will I

625
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,819
do a great job too?

626
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:17,905
Your Majesty.

627
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:20,991
By any chance...

628
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:25,830
Yes.

629
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:27,665
Traitor Lee Lim

630
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,126
is alive.

631
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:31,836
And he hasn't aged a day.

632
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,756
Because of that, I must leave
the palace again in a few days.

633
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,467
I ought to track him down.

634
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,928
And this rendezvous

635
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,807
<i>will not take place
in the Kingdom of Corea.</i>

636
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:50,271
Since you are second in line,
I need you to stay at the palace.

637
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,606
For me

638
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:54,692
and for the Kingdom of Corea,

639
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:56,861
you must stay safe.

640
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:02,074
Your Majesty will track him down yourself?

641
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:04,910
No, I cannot let you do that.

642
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,289
I know what you're worried about.

643
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,376
But I promise you
that I will protect myself.

644
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:16,630
So you must do the same.

645
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,591
Protect yourself.

646
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,968
This is a King's Order.

647
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,517
Understood.

648
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:31,770
I will do so, Your Majesty.

649
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:38,944
Okay, thank you.

650
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,699
That vehicle, 7370, is registered

651
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:45,701
under a missing person.

652
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,328
Sit down and have some food first.

653
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,504
It's common for punks who tail cops to use
cars with false registration.

654
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,174
But I wonder

655
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,469
if it could have been tailing you
for much longer.

656
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,054
And why was it at the penitentiary?

657
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:07,056
Does anything come to mind?

658
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,266
Tell me more about that.

659
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:11,185
About what?

660
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:14,063
That place you went to.
The science fiction story.

661
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:26,408
Well...

662
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:29,036
I was there just for a day.

663
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:32,665
That place is called the Kingdom of Corea,

664
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:34,750
<i>and it's not a divided country.</i>

665
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:38,629
<i>So you can actually take the train
and go all the way up to Pyongyang.</i>

666
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,841
<i>The capital city is Busan,</i>

667
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:47,012
<i>and there is a king
who is cherished by the people.</i>

668
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,849
<i>I even went to our station.</i>

669
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,813
<i>From the uniform to the vehicles,
everything was different,</i>

670
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,565
<i>but I was still so happy to see everyone.</i>

671
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,900
<i>I even saw Chief Park and Detective Shim.</i>

672
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,821
<i>Even in that world, they were cops</i>

673
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:05,739
as if they were destined to be.

674
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,243
Then

675
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:12,496
I went to find you.

676
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:15,541
But you weren't

677
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:17,668
there.

678
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:22,631
Neither at the station
nor in Pyeongchang-dong.

679
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:26,302
Could you have inherited
the family business and become rich?

680
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,429
Or maybe you live abroad or something.

681
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:29,972
Lucky you.

682
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:34,685
I was here.

683
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:37,938
What?

684
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,191
Let's eat.

685
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:42,651
We have to go somewhere.

686
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:44,528
Where?

687
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,334
LEE SANG-DO, JANG YEON-JI
KIM GI-HWAN, YANGSUN CARE CENTER

688
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,585
KANG HYEON-MIN, KANG SIN-JAE

689
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:00,794
KANG HYEON-MIN

690
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,049
KANG SIN-JAE

691
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:11,722
LEE JI-HUN
OCTOBER 28, 1987 - DECEMBER 28, 1994

692
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:15,851
How do you

693
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:17,603
know about this?

694
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,106
Gyeong-ran gave me some reports
to pass along to you.

695
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,192
She said it's top secret.

696
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:25,694
So I took a peek at them

697
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,323
to see what you're after

698
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:31,283
and where you're headed.

699
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:34,995
And this

700
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:36,622
is where I ended up.

701
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:42,086
I see.

702
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,383
I can tell you

703
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:49,968
who this boy is.

704
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:51,428
I know.

705
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,516
That's why we're here.

706
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:59,311
You said you couldn't find me
in the other world.

707
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:01,980
I know why.

708
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:05,943
Why?

709
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,739
Do you know why I became a cop?

710
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:15,911
I hoped

711
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:18,831
I'd be holding a gun in my hand

712
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:21,250
when someone asked me

713
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:25,337
to identify myself.

714
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,466
So that I can either shoot myself or him.

715
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:33,846
What do you mean?

716
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:35,931
Who are you?

717
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,769
The day when Eun-sup
wasn't the Eun-sup we know,

718
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:48,235
I called the name of the man
who claimed he was a king.

719
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,570
His name?

720
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,489
You mean, that unidentified man

721
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,200
told you his name?

722
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,244
No,

723
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,122
I just called his name.

724
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,292
The name that I remembered.

725
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:09,882
Lee Gon.

726
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:12,593
And I was right.

727
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:14,970
It's because I was here...

728
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,723
In this world

729
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:21,435
with you.

730
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,814
I was the reason why you couldn't find me

731
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:29,818
anywhere in that world.

732
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:32,029
Because of me, Kang Sin-jae.

733
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:37,576
That is a fact.

734
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:40,788
But as for who I really am...

735
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:43,040
I'm not sure yet.

736
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:55,344
You were

737
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,013
here.

738
00:50:58,847 --> 00:50:59,807
You were here

739
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,435
all along.

740
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:05,771
But am I supposed to be here?

741
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:13,779
Will you...

742
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,366
welcome me?

743
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,191
How did you know?

744
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:56,363
You asked me to find
the traitor's followers,

745
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:59,408
but the traitor himself is alive.

746
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:02,828
Lee Lim. He's the talk of the town now.

747
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,205
Watch what you say.

748
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:08,834
Seeing how cautious you are about this,

749
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:11,295
it must be true.

750
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,675
All the videos of the scene
are completely gone.

751
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,094
Even from foreign servers.

752
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:21,221
Can KU find them?

753
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:24,516
Is your secretary's office
actually that capable?

754
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:27,603
Why do you need them?

755
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:33,775
Do you want to catch the traitor
or become one yourself?

756
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:36,320
Just tell me whether or not
you can find them.

757
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,614
If I find them for you,
will I get out early?

758
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:41,617
How about the spring equinox?
I'll be out when spring begins.

759
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:47,331
In this country, special pardon
has never been issued in February.

760
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,750
An execution is more likely.

761
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,377
How about Admiral Yi Sun-shin's birthday?

762
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:53,337
April?

763
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:54,671
That's a long way ahead.

764
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,465
How about <i>Gyeongchip</i>?

765
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:58,550
Just rot here forever.

766
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,637
Okay, fine. Then I'll find them
and keep them for myself.

767
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:06,767
<i>Ribbit, ribbit, the frogs are singing</i>

768
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:11,021
<i>All together with the son, the grandson
And the daughter-in-law</i>

769
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:12,439
Fine. <i>Gyeongchip</i>, it is.

770
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,483
When can you get them?

771
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:19,905
I'll call you.

772
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,741
I'll make everyone
in the secretary's office work late.

773
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:30,123
<i>They sing all night but no one's listening</i>

774
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,335
<i>Even though no one is listening</i>

775
00:53:57,985 --> 00:54:00,612
Prince Imperial Geum!

776
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,239
You...

777
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,243
You haven't aged one bit.

778
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:07,911
Why are you surprised?

779
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:11,665
You were the first person to find out
that I didn't die.

780
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:13,542
You've known for the longest.

781
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,337
Anybody there?

782
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:18,755
I'm pretty sure

783
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:26,221
I slew all of them on my way here.

784
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,350
Don't be surprised.

785
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:34,187
I came to collect
what's rightfully mine, Jong-in.

786
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,695
Put it down.

787
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,239
It's the King's ring,
and it does not belong to us.

788
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,283
I was next in line to the throne.

789
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:48,076
It's just that I was born to a concubine.

790
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:50,662
I am the ring's rightful heir,

791
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:55,542
-so it belongs to me.
-Nonsense.

792
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:58,754
We dare not covet that ring.

793
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:01,423
"We"?

794
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:11,099
You and I can never be "we."

795
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:20,358
How can you identify with someone

796
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,944
who can kill you this instant?

797
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:24,696
Such insolence!

798
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:29,201
I will choke our dear nephew
just like this

799
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,412
and take the Manpasikjeok from him.

800
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:39,669
Then I'll be the only one
in possession of the Manpasikjeok.

801
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:47,928
I don't know the extent of
what I'll be able to do

802
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:50,847
when I'm in full possession of it.

803
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,183
To make that happen,

804
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:59,439
our dear nephew needs to suffer despair
and crumble away.

805
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,317
And for that reason,

806
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:07,280
I want him to lose
another person in his life.

807
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:14,621
You, to be specific.

808
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,352
Don't think this is unfair.

809
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,563
You're smart,

810
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,107
so I'm sure you saw this coming.

811
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,642
Why aren't you surprised?

812
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,519
Because I'm a curious person.

813
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:22,647
I don't like seeing blood.

814
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,691
Did you fight?

815
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,651
I am in the middle of a fight.

816
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:28,528
I still have a long way to go.

817
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:32,657
What are you reading?

818
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:35,744
<i>King Arthur.</i>

819
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:40,332
It's a story about a man with noble blood
drawing a sword and becoming king.

820
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:42,542
Only those with noble blood
can become king?

821
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:45,170
That's a terrible story.

822
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:47,672
Forget noble blood.

823
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:52,010
The sword must be
drawn by those who know how to use it.

824
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:53,887
What if a villain draws the sword?

825
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:55,931
Someone who is not just.

826
00:57:56,056 --> 00:57:58,099
Justice doesn't make the sword.

827
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,102
The sword decides what justice is.

828
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:05,398
It seems that the things in your world
keep changing.

829
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,068
Anyway, goodbye.

830
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:11,404
I want to know how this story ends.

831
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:25,043
Did you come alone?

832
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:26,795
Are you expecting someone?

833
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,594
I know the room service is pretty good,

834
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:37,222
but I thought you might want
some home-cooked food.

835
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:52,654
Since you're here,
I need to show you this.

836
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,075
I gave this to your king.

837
00:58:57,158 --> 00:59:01,621
Right. His Majesty left it with me,
but I can't look up anything on it.

838
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:05,500
I see.

839
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:07,794
This is why he brought all that change.

840
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:12,632
Why can't you look up anything?
Is there no Wi-Fi connection?

841
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:15,635
You'll see why.

842
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,054
I can't even say it.

843
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,776
<i>Want to see what I've been looking up?</i>

844
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:33,862
<i>A king never</i>

845
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:35,905
<i>leaves any traces.</i>

846
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:40,869
<i>Are you working now
or just doing day-to-day stuff?</i>

847
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:43,621
<i>To me, every moment in your world</i>

848
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:45,874
<i>was scandalous.</i>

849
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,626
<i>Because of Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.</i>

850
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:56,217
I'm amazed that you didn't delete this
all this time.

851
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:03,516
All deleted. You can now use this
to look things up.

852
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,227
I thought you'd want to keep it.

853
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:09,773
I'll remember it.

854
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:14,444
We shouldn't leave evidence, you know.

855
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:19,699
We need to make sure those from your world
don't leave any traces in this world.

856
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:23,411
You know what?

857
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:27,832
Besides His Majesty himself,
you're the only one

858
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:30,877
who can delete what His Majesty wrote.

859
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:36,257
Can you handle it?

860
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:40,011
-Handle what?
-Everything that will happen

861
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:41,888
after Traitor Lee Lim is caught.

862
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,558
You two belong to different worlds.

863
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:48,353
Will you travel back and forth?

864
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:52,065
His Majesty is the King of a country.

865
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,609
He needs to be with someone
who will be his queen.

866
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,529
Can you abandon everything you have here

867
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:01,825
and become the Queen
of the Kingdom of Corea?

868
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:06,037
And keep the two worlds a secret

869
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:09,165
forever?

870
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:02,969
Your Majesty.

871
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:06,264
Your Majesty...

872
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:12,353
What's the matter?

873
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:17,192
Buyeong...

874
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,653
His Highness Prince Buyeong...

875
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:27,827
His Highness Prince Buyeong...

876
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:34,644
Ma'am!

877
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:36,729
Ma'am!

878
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:40,858
Ma'am.

879
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:42,902
Ma'am.

880
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:47,031
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

881
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:14,309
Earlier today,

882
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:17,645
it was very sunny.

883
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:21,566
Because it was so sunny,

884
01:04:22,734 --> 01:04:23,860
I wondered

885
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:26,904
if you would have been able to

886
01:04:28,547 --> 01:04:32,509
gather your strength
to finally sprout today.

887
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:37,332
So I rushed home.

888
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:02,625
Hey.

889
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:06,629
How have you been?

890
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:13,302
It took you

891
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:15,680
a while this time.

892
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:21,853
Because I had to come from far away.

893
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:27,525
I realized that

894
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:31,946
I never even gave you a single flower.

895
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:34,240
That's why

896
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:38,077
I crossed the universe for you.

897
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:12,236
But the thing is,

898
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:18,284
I have to go back now.

899
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:21,496
You have to go back?

900
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:26,584
Right.

901
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:31,589
I also realized I never told you this.

902
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:43,851
I love you.

903
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:50,983
I am deeply...

904
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:56,572
in love with you.

905
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:03,973
<i>There will come a moment</i>

906
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:08,227
<i>when it seems I've disappeared.</i>

907
01:09:10,354 --> 01:09:11,314
<i>I don't want you to</i>

908
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:13,482
<i>worry too much when that happens.</i>

909
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:16,903
<i>It just means</i>

910
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:21,324
<i>I'm walking through
the frozen moments in time.</i>

Jeong Tae-eul.

<i>I'm...</i>

916
01:10:58,546 --> 01:11:00,089
headed to the palace now.

917
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:02,591
<i>I'll hurry.</i>

918
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:04,927
