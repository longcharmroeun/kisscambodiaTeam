PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

EPISODE 14

5
00:00:45,157 --> 00:00:48,744
<i>Sin-jae, I found Koo Eun-a.</i>
<i>The freezer on the second basement floor.</i>

6
00:00:48,828 --> 00:00:49,870
Okay, I'm coming.

7
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:19,024
Sin-jae.

8
00:01:41,714 --> 00:01:43,883
His Majesty has such an exquisite face,

9
00:01:44,383 --> 00:01:46,635
so I reduced the saturation
of the royal robe.

10
00:01:47,094 --> 00:01:51,223
And the light in Gwangyeongjeon
showcases the splendidness of the crown

11
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,186
-as well as His Majesty's radiant face.
-<i>How far did you go?</i>

12
00:02:05,404 --> 00:02:10,784
<i>Are you</i> <i>headed toward that perilous night?</i>

JEONG TAE-EUL
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

14
00:02:33,641 --> 00:02:37,895
If you're looking for the whip,
you're wasting your time.

15
00:02:38,103 --> 00:02:40,731
You've got to give up one or the other,
Your Majesty.

16
00:02:41,982 --> 00:02:43,859
It's either your whip or your life.

17
00:02:46,153 --> 00:02:49,240
It's Lee Lim
who wants to take Your Majesty's life,

18
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:52,409
and what I want is the whip.

19
00:02:54,745 --> 00:02:57,498
Nothing here is mine to begin with,

20
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,251
so I'll settle with the whip.

21
00:03:15,933 --> 00:03:18,310
Get her.

22
00:03:18,686 --> 00:03:19,770
You come first.

23
00:03:25,776 --> 00:03:26,986
Get the whip first.

24
00:03:28,487 --> 00:03:31,031
The gray coat in the closet.
The eighth one.

25
00:03:31,615 --> 00:03:32,992
The inside pocket.

26
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:36,203
Detective Jeong, it's me.

27
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,748
His Majesty has been poisoned.
He needs to be treated at once.

28
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,834
<i>How is he?</i>

29
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:45,087
I'm out of town at the moment.
I'll call you right back.

30
00:03:45,504 --> 00:03:48,090
I'll have someone call you.
Follow his instructions.

31
00:03:52,678 --> 00:03:53,512
Ms. Kim.

32
00:03:55,222 --> 00:03:57,308
There's an emergency poisoned case.

33
00:03:57,808 --> 00:04:01,061
But he's an unregistered resident,
so he can't go to the hospital.

34
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:03,105
Please help him.

35
00:04:07,735 --> 00:04:09,194
Hang in there.

36
00:04:09,737 --> 00:04:11,488
Please hang in there.

37
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:14,283
Eun-sup, you should wait here.

38
00:04:38,932 --> 00:04:40,726
EMERGENCY BELL

39
00:04:55,574 --> 00:04:57,951
You're that detective
from the other day, right?

40
00:04:58,369 --> 00:05:00,704
Carrying two cell phones...

41
00:05:01,288 --> 00:05:03,374
I thought he looked like you.

42
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:07,294
He's your family, right?

43
00:05:09,421 --> 00:05:10,923
What are you doing here?

44
00:05:11,507 --> 00:05:15,594
It turns out that my husband
had a good friend I didn't know about.

45
00:05:16,887 --> 00:05:19,014
He paid off our debt for us

46
00:05:19,264 --> 00:05:22,267
and even got me a job here.

47
00:05:26,188 --> 00:05:28,690
Have any other family members visited?

48
00:05:28,774 --> 00:05:29,983
No, no one.

49
00:05:30,692 --> 00:05:34,488
I was told to tell whichever family member
that comes to answer the phone.

50
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:36,698
Someone will call you.

51
00:05:49,711 --> 00:05:51,255
He's not out yet?

52
00:05:56,552 --> 00:05:59,012
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes, he was poisoned.

53
00:05:59,888 --> 00:06:03,308
But thankfully, we could save him
because Eun-sup acted speedily.

54
00:06:03,642 --> 00:06:05,853
He'll wake up soon,
so don't worry too much.

55
00:06:06,562 --> 00:06:09,398
Who is he?
Why can't he go to the hospital?

56
00:06:09,481 --> 00:06:11,191
And why is he unregistered?

57
00:06:12,443 --> 00:06:15,612
I'm sorry.
I'll explain everything later on.

58
00:06:18,407 --> 00:06:20,659
Does this have to be kept
from Chief Park too?

59
00:06:21,577 --> 00:06:22,995
Yes, I'm sorry.

60
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:25,164
All right.

61
00:06:25,414 --> 00:06:28,500
This is my friend's clinic,
so he can only stay during the weekend.

62
00:06:28,584 --> 00:06:29,501
-That's it.
-Okay.

63
00:06:30,544 --> 00:06:32,421
Thank you. Thank you so much.

64
00:06:36,049 --> 00:06:37,342
You cannot go in.

65
00:06:37,926 --> 00:06:39,803
The person who poisoned His Majesty

66
00:06:40,721 --> 00:06:42,764
looked exactly like you.

67
00:06:43,432 --> 00:06:45,684
There's no guarantee that you're not her.

68
00:07:18,091 --> 00:07:19,259
<i>Eun-sup, it's me.</i>

69
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,348
Take Eun-bi and Kka-bi and go to my place.

70
00:07:26,225 --> 00:07:31,230
My dad, Eun-bi, Kka-bi, and you
should stay there together.

71
00:07:33,482 --> 00:07:37,528
If I come home, call me right away.

72
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:39,988
Got it?

73
00:07:40,072 --> 00:07:42,574
What do you mean?
Why should I call you when you--

74
00:07:47,496 --> 00:07:48,956
Is this what I think it is?

75
00:07:49,873 --> 00:07:50,707
Yes, it is.

76
00:07:53,585 --> 00:07:54,628
I'm counting on you.

77
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,473
<i>How did you</i> <i>end up at that point in time?</i>

78
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:50,892
<i>How did you manage to find me</i>

79
00:08:51,476 --> 00:08:53,437
<i>at that moment in time and stop me?</i>

80
00:09:26,428 --> 00:09:27,262
Your Majesty.

81
00:09:28,347 --> 00:09:29,514
Are you all right?

82
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,022
You got through it.

83
00:09:43,111 --> 00:09:46,990
Does Lieutenant Jeong know about this too?

84
00:09:50,786 --> 00:09:52,829
She did stop by.

85
00:09:55,082 --> 00:09:56,083
Yeong.

86
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,712
-You were probably mean to her.
-Your Majesty.

87
00:10:01,463 --> 00:10:02,964
We must return to the palace.

88
00:10:03,632 --> 00:10:05,634
I can't protect you in this world.

89
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:07,260
Can we go back to that?

90
00:10:07,678 --> 00:10:10,013
That thing you were going to tell
over a drink.

91
00:10:10,972 --> 00:10:11,848
What was it about?

92
00:10:18,939 --> 00:10:21,400
I got flustered
because of what happened to you,

93
00:10:22,984 --> 00:10:24,027
so I forgot.

94
00:10:26,655 --> 00:10:27,906
I don't buy that.

95
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,664
If you need more time to think,

96
00:10:37,499 --> 00:10:40,252
-I'll hear it when I'm back.
-You need more rest.

97
00:10:40,335 --> 00:10:44,464
Tell Lieutenant Jeong
that I'm sorry for leaving without a word.

98
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:47,843
And I want you to protect her

99
00:10:49,428 --> 00:10:50,887
until I return.

100
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:52,431
-Your Majesty.
-Yeong.

101
00:10:54,891 --> 00:10:58,478
It was me who saved myself.

102
00:11:01,773 --> 00:11:03,108
And today must be the day.

103
00:11:04,609 --> 00:11:06,695
I started hearing the flute I heard

104
00:11:09,614 --> 00:11:11,032
on the night of the treason.

105
00:13:20,996 --> 00:13:21,830
<i>It's Lee Lim.</i>

106
00:13:22,247 --> 00:13:23,707
<i>Is that you, my dear nephew?</i>

107
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:39,806
<i>Did you know?</i>

108
00:13:40,265 --> 00:13:43,184
<i>When the </i>Manpasikjeok <i>becomes one</i>
<i>inside the gate,</i>

109
00:13:43,685 --> 00:13:47,230
<i>both the axes for time and space</i>
<i>simultaneously form inside the gate.</i>

110
00:13:49,608 --> 00:13:51,443
<i>When the </i>Manpasikjeok<i> becomes whole,</i>

111
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,738
<i>it takes you to the moment</i>
<i>when you wish to save yourself.</i>

112
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:00,368
So where were the two of them taken
from there?

113
00:14:01,453 --> 00:14:05,540
Both the king and the traitor were taken
to the same point in time.

114
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,084
The night of the treason.

115
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:10,503
Why?

116
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:14,215
Because the king wished
to save both worlds from the traitor,

117
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:15,592
1 HOUR BEFORE THE COUP

118
00:14:15,675 --> 00:14:20,805
<i>and the traitor wished to save</i>
<i>his foolish self from failing the coup.</i>

119
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:42,243
What is this?

120
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:45,205
Who are you?

121
00:14:45,872 --> 00:14:48,959
You've been dreaming
of staging a coup here every single night

122
00:14:49,793 --> 00:14:51,211
under your dim-witted father

123
00:14:51,962 --> 00:14:55,840
and your younger brother who became king
just because he's the legitimate son.

124
00:14:57,175 --> 00:14:58,760
Hence, I came to save you.

125
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:02,722
To be more exact,
I came to save my foolish self.

126
00:15:03,723 --> 00:15:04,766
Who are you?

127
00:15:06,017 --> 00:15:07,686
Why do you look exactly like me?

128
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:09,104
Can't you tell?

129
00:15:10,021 --> 00:15:11,189
I'm you.

130
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,441
You from the year 2020.

131
00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:17,487
You're from the year 2020?

132
00:15:18,863 --> 00:15:20,448
I'd be 70 years old

133
00:15:21,366 --> 00:15:22,951
in 2020.

134
00:15:23,034 --> 00:15:26,871
You already know the answer.
That's what I realized, looking back.

135
00:15:27,998 --> 00:15:29,791
And that's why you staged the coup.

136
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:39,175
That must be it.

137
00:15:41,344 --> 00:15:43,513
The secret of the <i>Manpasikjeok</i>
must be true.

138
00:15:47,517 --> 00:15:49,978
The other world actually exists.

139
00:15:51,521 --> 00:15:52,647
Do you believe me now?

140
00:15:53,815 --> 00:15:55,483
Then I'll show you a shortcut.

141
00:15:56,443 --> 00:15:58,695
You should head
to the crown prince's chambers

142
00:15:58,778 --> 00:16:00,113
instead of Cheonjongo.

143
00:16:00,363 --> 00:16:01,823
Kill the crown prince first.

144
00:16:02,157 --> 00:16:04,534
If his past perishes,
his future will be no more.

145
00:16:05,285 --> 00:16:08,580
The crown prince is the one
who puts a stop to this coup.

146
00:16:09,164 --> 00:16:11,541
You mean, the eight-year-old boy
who is sleeping

147
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,002
to a lullaby at the moment?

148
00:16:16,463 --> 00:16:19,716
That's what I thought
and I only got half of the <i>Manpasikjeok.</i>

149
00:16:19,966 --> 00:16:22,719
So just do as I say.

150
00:16:23,303 --> 00:16:26,139
Slay the crown prince
and bring the whole <i>Manpasikjeok.</i>

151
00:16:27,057 --> 00:16:29,893
If I come to possess it,
that means it will be yours too.

152
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:33,772
So in other words,

153
00:16:35,148 --> 00:16:37,150
you failed.

154
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:44,574
You are none the wiser despite your age.

155
00:16:46,493 --> 00:16:50,080
Or should I say that "I" am?

156
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:53,041
If you're actually me,

157
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:56,920
you should be keeping your sword here.

158
00:17:11,351 --> 00:17:13,978
I will carry out the coup, not you.

159
00:17:16,564 --> 00:17:19,943
And I will come into possession
of the whole <i>Manpasikjeok,</i> not you.

160
00:18:07,824 --> 00:18:10,577
<i>So, the traitor failed to save himself.</i>

161
00:18:11,661 --> 00:18:14,289
<i>Instead, he created the monster</i>
<i>that he is today.</i>

162
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:19,669
You're telling the story
as if you've seen it.

163
00:18:23,047 --> 00:18:24,382
By the way, who are you?

164
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,593
Do you live around here?

165
00:18:28,136 --> 00:18:29,429
I warn people of danger

166
00:18:30,889 --> 00:18:32,515
and defeat the enemy.

167
00:18:33,683 --> 00:18:38,563
I also want to save myself
and become whole.

168
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:42,066
Your story is interesting. So?

169
00:18:43,693 --> 00:18:45,403
What happened to the king?

170
00:18:46,112 --> 00:18:47,739
He's following his destiny.

171
00:18:49,324 --> 00:18:52,660
Will he return safe and sound
without getting lost?

172
00:18:54,162 --> 00:18:56,497
The <i>Manpasikjeok</i> is powerless when halved.

173
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:40,792
Your Highness!

174
00:20:05,108 --> 00:20:07,318
Your Highness, we've lost too much time.

175
00:20:07,402 --> 00:20:09,404
-You need to get out of here.
-Wait.

176
00:20:09,487 --> 00:20:11,948
<i>There's an emergency in Cheonjongo. </i>

177
00:20:12,031 --> 00:20:15,368
Sir, you won't be able to escape
once the Royal Guards get here.

178
00:20:24,961 --> 00:20:25,962
Let's go.

179
00:20:26,254 --> 00:20:28,131
We're going to leave right now!

180
00:21:43,748 --> 00:21:44,707
<i>Emergency alert.</i>

181
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,752
<i>All Royal Guards,</i>
<i>gear up and gather at Cheonjongo.</i>

182
00:22:25,623 --> 00:22:28,501
Identify yourself.
Are you one of the traitor's followers?

183
00:22:30,294 --> 00:22:31,212
You...

184
00:22:33,256 --> 00:22:34,424
saw me that day?

185
00:22:36,384 --> 00:22:39,178
You won't believe me, but I am your king.

186
00:22:39,262 --> 00:22:41,889
You are my king? How dare you!

187
00:22:53,651 --> 00:22:54,527
I am

188
00:22:56,362 --> 00:22:58,364
deeply indebted to you.

189
00:23:01,742 --> 00:23:03,035
And as you advised,

190
00:23:05,955 --> 00:23:07,707
I am following my destiny.

191
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:10,918
So please

192
00:23:12,795 --> 00:23:14,005
just let me go.

193
00:23:15,298 --> 00:23:16,132
Please.

194
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:26,684
But...

195
00:23:52,293 --> 00:23:54,378
You shouldn't be wasting your time on me.

196
00:23:55,087 --> 00:23:58,174
The traitor's followers,
Sub-captain Yoo of the Royal Guards,

197
00:23:58,257 --> 00:24:00,468
Kim Gi-hwan, Noh Min-ho, Lee Cheol-jin,

198
00:24:00,551 --> 00:24:03,221
Kang Hyeong-uk, and Choi Sang-min
are with Lee Lim.

199
00:24:03,387 --> 00:24:07,934
You're coming from the secondary palace,
meaning they are headed to the rear gate.

200
00:24:08,351 --> 00:24:10,353
Who are you? Identify yourself.

201
00:24:15,691 --> 00:24:16,609
Drop your guns.

202
00:24:29,497 --> 00:24:30,331
I'm sorry.

203
00:25:01,946 --> 00:25:02,780
<i>Seung-heon.</i>

204
00:25:03,489 --> 00:25:04,532
Gon.

205
00:25:06,158 --> 00:25:06,993
Hey.

206
00:25:08,202 --> 00:25:09,161
Who are you?

207
00:25:10,454 --> 00:25:12,123
You're not the Royal Guards.

208
00:25:12,832 --> 00:25:14,166
Identify yourself.

209
00:25:15,543 --> 00:25:17,920
If you're a straggler,
you don't need to do this.

210
00:25:22,466 --> 00:25:23,593
Lee Seung-heon,

211
00:25:25,094 --> 00:25:26,262
it was you.

212
00:25:27,138 --> 00:25:30,725
You were the one who helped
Lee Lim escape.

213
00:25:31,976 --> 00:25:34,562
Because of you,
Lee Lim managed to escape the palace

214
00:25:36,063 --> 00:25:38,107
and arrived in the Republic of Korea.

215
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,400
Who are you?

216
00:26:11,891 --> 00:26:12,725
Hello?

217
00:26:13,351 --> 00:26:14,185
<i>It's me.</i>

218
00:26:15,436 --> 00:26:18,397
<i>His Majesty left.</i>

219
00:26:20,232 --> 00:26:21,651
<i>He asked me to tell you</i>

220
00:26:21,817 --> 00:26:25,154
<i>that he's sorry he had to leave</i>
<i>without even saying goodbye.</i>

221
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:03,498
<i>Hi, Mom. I have a question for you.</i>

222
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:04,874
<i>It's about Dad.</i>

223
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:09,838
<i>Did he run a care center by any chance?</i>
<i>Before he ended up in jail.</i>

224
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:23,810
What's gotten into you?
You never visited me.

225
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:29,733
It was you, right?

226
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:34,195
You turned Kang Hyeon-min
into Kang Sin-jae.

227
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:39,117
Did you meet him?

228
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:43,955
You met that man, didn't you?

229
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:47,792
That's why I was chosen?

230
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:52,255
Because Lee Lim needed a care center.

231
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:54,341
And the freezer.

232
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:58,636
What did he say? Will he take you there?

233
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:01,181
What about me?

234
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:03,850
He said nothing about me?

235
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:08,563
Just tell me what happened.

236
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:19,783
We were told Sin-jae wouldn't wake up,

237
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,328
and his mom was utterly devastated.

238
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,039
But that man

239
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,542
showed me a photo of you.

240
00:28:32,587 --> 00:28:34,339
He said he'd hand you over

241
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:38,176
as a bonus
if I sold the care center to him.

242
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:42,180
Tell him

243
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:44,140
to visit me

244
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:47,102
just once.

245
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:49,729
Just once.

246
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:32,772
<i>Sin-jae, you're a miracle to me.</i>

-They might already be dead.
-<i>Just a moment.</i>

270

<i>Hello? I'm sorry, but where are you now?</i>

274
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:09,447
So

275
00:33:12,116 --> 00:33:13,326
it already happened.

276
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:20,166

<i>-Please don't hang up.</i>

00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:01,499
You looked good in the navy uniform.

-You're the only woman in my life.
-You have quite a wit.

Who are you? How do you know my name?

285
00:35:26,751 --> 00:35:28,336
You're actually five years old.

286
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,215
I'm...

287
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:36,469
from a different time.

288
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:40,473
I ended up in 1994,

289
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:45,520
so I have to travel through 26 years.

290

I think I know who you are.

293
00:35:58,157 --> 00:35:59,534
You know who I am?

294
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:01,661
You're a kidnapper.

295
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:12,421
Your personality hasn't changed
in the past 30 years,

296
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:14,632
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

297
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:22,682
-Who might you be?
-I'm Instructor Jeong's acquaintance.

298
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:25,351
Please accept my deepest condolences.

299
00:36:41,993 --> 00:36:42,827

It's spring now.

FORENSICS TEAM, GYEONG-RAN

305
00:37:58,527 --> 00:37:59,362
Hey.

306
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:02,198
<i>I stumbled upon something very strange.</i>

307
00:38:02,865 --> 00:38:06,619
This fine voice sounds very familiar.
Give it a listen.

308
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:11,791
<i>Lee Seong-jae.</i>
<i>Date of birth, February 27, 1951.</i>

<i>Lee Eun-ho.</i>
<i>Date of birth, October 23, 1952.</i>

<i>Lee Ji-hun.</i>
<i>Date of birth, October 28, 1987.</i>

311
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:21,217
What is this? Where did you get this?

312
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:23,386
<i>It's that guy, right?</i>

313
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:27,807
That handsome watermark.
Does this make sense though?

314
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:31,268
There's a record of him
calling and filing a report in 1994.

315
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:32,853
It wasn't there last time.

316
00:38:33,729 --> 00:38:35,356
<i>The intel you were after...</i>

317
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:39,193
<i>This guy is the suspect</i>
<i>in the death of that family.</i>

318
00:38:40,611 --> 00:38:43,072
<i>I'm from a different time.</i>
<i>Jeong Tae-eul?</i>

319
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:45,157
<i>I ended up in 1994.</i>

320
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:50,162
<i>I'll be there soon. I am on my way</i>

321
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:52,540
to you.

322
00:38:56,627 --> 00:38:57,461
I have

323
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,798
new memories.

324
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:05,720
I remember everything.

325
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,098
When I was five,

326
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,269
he came to see me.

327
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,397
He was over there...

328
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:24,238
Wait, 1994?

329
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:26,615
The coup took place

330
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,118
in 1994.

331
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:31,454
He went back to that night.

332
00:39:32,663 --> 00:39:36,000
Then he came to the Republic of Korea
that night.

333
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:40,337
He's...

334
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:43,758
in the past now.

335
00:40:18,918 --> 00:40:20,461
How far have you come?

336
00:40:24,507 --> 00:40:26,550
Where should I wait for you?

337
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:00,960
Thank you for your help.

338
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:04,630
You said he's your twin brother.

339
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:06,924
It's a lie, isn't it?

340
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,847
The stories you've been telling me
weren't about a dream.

341
00:41:16,934 --> 00:41:18,477
I really was a quack.

342
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:25,234
Which one of you is Sin-jae?
And which one is Hyeon-min?

343
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:30,865
I'm trying to find out.

344
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:49,383
KIND CIVIL POLICE

Tae-eul!

346
00:41:52,553 --> 00:41:54,180
We got the footage that shows

347
00:41:54,263 --> 00:41:56,724
routes of the vehicles
that visited the care center.

348
00:41:56,807 --> 00:41:57,641
Okay.

349
00:41:58,726 --> 00:42:01,353
What's going on?
Are you looking for someone?

350
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:02,980
No, don't mind me.

351
00:42:03,689 --> 00:42:07,902
Gosh, it looks like we'll have to pull
three all-nighters in a row.

352
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:09,987
I'll get it down to two.

353
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,001
I received some of them via cloud.

354
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:27,213
I gathered all the footage
from the small businesses and malls.

355
00:42:27,671 --> 00:42:28,797
Name, Yoo Jo-yeol.

356
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:31,342
He regularly gave money
to the care center director.

357
00:42:31,425 --> 00:42:34,428
We need to find out where he went
after leaving the care center.

358
00:43:31,235 --> 00:43:32,569
I found him!

359
00:43:32,945 --> 00:43:34,571
I think I found him.

360
00:43:34,947 --> 00:43:37,700
Gyuyeong Villa, 31-4 Gwangi-dong.
From two months ago.

361
00:43:37,783 --> 00:43:39,535
I found him too.

362
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:42,788
From three months ago, 31-4 Gwangi-dong.
Also at Gyuyeong Villa.

363
00:43:43,831 --> 00:43:45,332
Looks like we found him.

364
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:48,669
I'll find Chief Park and get his approval.

365
00:43:49,878 --> 00:43:52,089
We cannot reach anyone at the care center.

366
00:43:55,259 --> 00:43:56,093
Get ready.

367
00:44:37,843 --> 00:44:39,386
Hello? Ms. Song Jeong-hye?

368
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,392
Ms. Song Jeong-hye, are you inside?

369
00:44:51,357 --> 00:44:53,734
Sin-jae, something smells weird.

370
00:44:56,111 --> 00:44:57,571
It's gas. Get out! Now!

371
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:12,628
<i>A fire broke out at an apartment building</i>
<i>awaiting redevelopment in Gwangi-dong.</i>

372
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:14,797
<i>It was caused by a gas explosion.</i>

373
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,300
<i>Six units in the building</i>
<i>were engulfed in flames,</i>

374
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:21,178
<i>but thankfully no one got hurt.</i>

375
00:45:21,553 --> 00:45:24,640
<i>The police are investigating</i>
<i>what caused the gas explosion.</i>

376
00:45:24,932 --> 00:45:26,517
<i>Fire officials were dispatched…</i>

377
00:45:43,617 --> 00:45:44,743
How have you been?

378
00:45:46,036 --> 00:45:47,121
Who are you?

379
00:45:48,038 --> 00:45:51,041
I was sent by the person
who can help you get your life back.

380
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:56,130
The life as the granddaughter
of Hogyeong Pharmaceuticals' founder.

381
00:45:57,548 --> 00:46:00,801
You know me?

382
00:46:00,884 --> 00:46:02,553
Who I...

383
00:46:02,636 --> 00:46:04,763
Do you know who I used to be?

384
00:46:04,847 --> 00:46:06,890
Do you know who I really am?

385
00:46:09,977 --> 00:46:12,771
He'd like to know
what you could do for him

386
00:46:13,814 --> 00:46:17,693
if he were to help you get your life back.

387
00:46:18,527 --> 00:46:20,737
Anything. I'll do anything.

388
00:46:21,113 --> 00:46:24,283
Seriously, I'll do anything he says.

389
00:46:24,366 --> 00:46:25,617
Please...

390
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:28,078
Please help me go back.

391
00:46:28,579 --> 00:46:30,289
Please, ma'am.

392
00:46:32,499 --> 00:46:33,333
Hello?

393
00:46:33,834 --> 00:46:35,752
Yes. It's me.

394
00:46:35,836 --> 00:46:39,006
Mom, is everything okay?
Are you at Auntie's place?

395
00:46:39,423 --> 00:46:43,218
Yes, Secretary Kim gave me a ride.

396
00:46:43,635 --> 00:46:46,263
There are no reporters here,
so I'll be fine.

397
00:46:47,431 --> 00:46:50,184
What about you? Are you all right?

398
00:46:51,268 --> 00:46:53,479
Have you been eating well?

399
00:46:53,562 --> 00:46:56,315
I'm just temporarily suspended,
that's all. Don't worry.

400
00:46:58,358 --> 00:46:59,234
And Mom.

401
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:03,864
If I ask you what you had for dinner,

402
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:07,326
make sure you say you had mackerel, okay?

403
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:09,286
What are you talking about?

404
00:47:09,828 --> 00:47:11,079
Mackerel? Why?

405
00:47:11,413 --> 00:47:12,372
<i>I'm not joking.</i>

406
00:47:12,748 --> 00:47:16,251
You have to say that, okay?
If not, there will be a problem.

407
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:19,713
What did you have for dinner?

408
00:47:21,465 --> 00:47:22,382
I had mackerel.

409
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:24,092
Good?

410
00:47:24,176 --> 00:47:25,010
Yes.

411
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:27,888
I'll call you again. Bye.

412
00:47:47,074 --> 00:47:49,326
I could tell he recognized me.

413
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:57,417
<i>Why is it that only the two of you</i>
<i>can open the gate with that thing</i>

414
00:47:58,919 --> 00:48:02,089
and even know more about the pain
I've never experienced before?

415
00:48:20,649 --> 00:48:22,609
I can have it too, right?

416
00:48:24,278 --> 00:48:26,655
The thing that you men
of the Royal Family have.

417
00:48:29,783 --> 00:48:30,951
<i>Manpasikjeok.</i>

418
00:49:43,899 --> 00:49:44,775
<i>Not yet.</i>

419
00:49:45,317 --> 00:49:46,693
<i>Not entirely.</i>

420
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:49,154
<i>I missed you so much.</i>

421
00:49:51,323 --> 00:49:53,617
<i>I was going to just hear your voice</i>
<i>and leave.</i>

422
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:58,538
<i>I was going to call you</i>
<i>from that pay phone over there.</i>

423
00:50:20,977 --> 00:50:22,521
How far have you come?

424
00:50:25,148 --> 00:50:26,483
Are you almost here?

425
00:50:36,618 --> 00:50:37,744
Election day.

426
00:50:38,662 --> 00:50:40,789
PEOPLE'S CHOICE

427
00:50:41,206 --> 00:50:42,082
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

428
00:50:48,964 --> 00:50:52,050
I'm thinking of opening
a milk tea place when I get the building.

429
00:50:52,467 --> 00:50:53,427
That sounds great.

430
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,346
Give a discount to the kids
at the taekwondo center.

431
00:50:57,222 --> 00:50:58,515
What's milk tea though?

432
00:51:03,937 --> 00:51:06,606
Do you want to try it with me tomorrow?
Market research.

433
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:07,858
Sounds good.

434
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:09,651
What about me?

435
00:51:09,943 --> 00:51:11,778
What about me? I have a lot of time.

436
00:51:11,945 --> 00:51:13,697
Shouldn't you return to school?

437
00:51:14,698 --> 00:51:16,992
Jeez, this is so loud.

438
00:51:18,744 --> 00:51:21,705
My fourth goal was to return to school,
but that won't happen.

439
00:51:21,788 --> 00:51:23,457
I have to look after my siblings.

440
00:51:27,002 --> 00:51:31,047
By the way,
are you getting a call from this number?

441
00:51:31,465 --> 00:51:32,299
Yes.

442
00:51:32,466 --> 00:51:36,094
It looked like a spam call,
so I forwarded it to voice mail.

443
00:51:36,928 --> 00:51:38,597
Isn't it the murder game?

444
00:51:39,055 --> 00:51:41,683
Usually, the one who answers first dies
or is the culprit.

445
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:45,604
Then I'll die.

446
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:48,064
Hello?

447
00:51:48,482 --> 00:51:49,316
<i>Kang Sin-jae?</i>

448
00:51:51,401 --> 00:51:52,652
Who's this?

449
00:51:52,778 --> 00:51:54,237
<i>Someone who needs your help.</i>

450
00:51:54,613 --> 00:51:58,617
<i>I'd appreciate it if you could pass it</i>
<i>to Lieutenant Jeong on your left.</i>

451
00:52:06,708 --> 00:52:08,418
He's asking for you.

452
00:52:11,588 --> 00:52:13,465
Just eat, guys. I'll be right back.

453
00:52:26,728 --> 00:52:28,814
You know me, don't you?

454
00:52:34,069 --> 00:52:36,530
Aren't you that man
whom I met when I was little?

455
00:52:36,947 --> 00:52:40,116
My mom's taekwondo belt...
That was you, wasn't it?

456
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:43,328
You remember that?

457
00:52:45,997 --> 00:52:47,207
Who are you?

458
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:51,253
You're wearing the exact same clothes
as that day.

459
00:52:52,504 --> 00:52:54,589
Also, your voice and face are the same.

460
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:59,219
You got me this outfit as a gift.
And this face is my gift for you.

461
00:53:01,012 --> 00:53:02,347
What a crazy nutjob.

462
00:53:03,557 --> 00:53:05,141
Sorry, my bad.

463
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:11,189
Sir, I'm sorry,
but I'm going to have to check your ID.

464
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:45,640
I should've given you a heads-up,
but I don't have ID.

465
00:53:46,433 --> 00:53:48,685
And I've told you numerous times,
I'm not crazy.

466
00:53:50,186 --> 00:53:52,522
How did you know
I was looking for a hair tie?

467
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:55,734
Because I like it when you do that.

468
00:54:01,364 --> 00:54:03,867
I'm happy to see all five of you
in one place.

469
00:54:04,492 --> 00:54:06,620
Those who'd help me
no matter what happens.

470
00:54:09,873 --> 00:54:11,750
How did you know I was Jeong Tae-eul?

471
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:13,877
I heard you asked for me.

472
00:54:17,088 --> 00:54:18,506
I was prepared for this,

473
00:54:20,342 --> 00:54:24,220
but the moment when you don't recognize me
still makes me sad.

474
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,601
That's why I'm here.

475
00:54:30,727 --> 00:54:32,646
To be part of your memories of today.

476
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,816
We're passing through different points
in time at the moment.

477
00:54:38,735 --> 00:54:40,320
So until I get back,

478
00:54:41,571 --> 00:54:45,533
please don't get tired of waiting
and hang in there.

479
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:51,998
We'll meet again in Gwanghwamun.

480
00:54:53,166 --> 00:54:55,377
I'll be wearing a jacket
with a lot of buttons,

481
00:54:55,961 --> 00:54:57,545
and I'll be there with Maximus.

482
00:54:58,505 --> 00:54:59,422
Can you

483
00:55:00,715 --> 00:55:03,927
try to be a little friendlier to me
when we meet again?

484
00:55:06,054 --> 00:55:07,097
And make

485
00:55:08,682 --> 00:55:09,599
some more time

486
00:55:11,059 --> 00:55:12,185
for me.

487
00:55:13,269 --> 00:55:14,813
We don't have much time.

488
00:55:16,898 --> 00:55:18,274
Why will we meet again?

489
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:20,151
Because that's our destiny.

490
00:55:23,321 --> 00:55:25,824
I can't come and see you
at every point in time

491
00:55:25,907 --> 00:55:29,619
because the cracks
in the <i>Manpasikjeok</i> are deepening.

492
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:36,251
I should get going.

493
00:55:37,377 --> 00:55:41,131
Whenever I'm with you,
I forget to keep count.

494
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,554
Bye.

495
00:56:27,635 --> 00:56:28,470
He came

496
00:56:30,055 --> 00:56:31,181
to see me again.

497
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:36,770
He came to see me again

498
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,481
in 2016.

499
00:57:24,234 --> 00:57:27,278
<i>Wait for me just a little bit more.</i>

500
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:29,948
<i>I'm almost there.</i>

501
00:58:29,382 --> 00:58:30,800
Ho-pil to the second floor.

502
00:58:34,554 --> 00:58:35,388
Yeong.

503
00:58:39,017 --> 00:58:39,851
Your Majesty.

504
00:58:49,777 --> 00:58:50,778
Your Majesty.

505
00:58:52,363 --> 00:58:54,073
Why on earth are you there?

506
00:58:56,242 --> 00:58:57,118
<i>Why are you here?</i>

507
00:58:57,535 --> 00:58:59,495
You should be at the start line.

508
00:58:59,704 --> 00:59:01,539
-You didn't get changed.
-I'm sure I did.

509
00:59:01,873 --> 00:59:04,542
Yeong, do you have the access card
to the racetracks?

510
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:05,710
Don't ask why.

511
00:59:19,933 --> 00:59:22,685
Don't touch this. Just leave it here.

512
00:59:23,061 --> 00:59:24,270
It is the king's order.

513
00:59:25,021 --> 00:59:27,941
And you must remember
what I'm going to tell you now.

514
00:59:28,608 --> 00:59:29,651
What's going on?

515
00:59:30,735 --> 00:59:33,947
You'll eventually end up in a place
called the Republic of Korea.

516
00:59:34,989 --> 00:59:36,699
You'll be left alone there,

517
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:39,953
and I need you to locate Song Jeong-hye.

518
00:59:42,121 --> 00:59:44,707
I think that's what you wanted
to talk to me about

519
00:59:44,958 --> 00:59:45,959
over a drink.

520
00:59:46,626 --> 00:59:47,794
Who is Song Jeong-hye?

521
00:59:47,877 --> 00:59:50,129
Even if I explain,
you won't understand now.

522
00:59:50,797 --> 00:59:53,132
But you'll come to figure it out.

523
00:59:54,801 --> 00:59:57,804
When that moment comes,
reach out to Detective Kang for help.

524
00:59:58,179 --> 01:00:00,556
You won't trust
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul then.

525
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:04,060
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul?
Did you meet her?

526
01:00:06,938 --> 01:00:08,189
I'm on my way

527
01:00:09,482 --> 01:00:11,025
to meet her.

528
01:00:13,152 --> 01:00:15,405
So you must not stop me now.

529
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,282
This is the king's order, too.

530
01:00:18,616 --> 01:00:22,620
If I miss each moment by even a second,
I can't meet her.

531
01:00:24,998 --> 01:00:27,917
Go wait at the finish line.
I'll win today.

532
01:00:40,805 --> 01:00:42,557
Hey, out of the way!

533
01:01:22,764 --> 01:01:24,057
Tae-eul, it's me.

534
01:01:25,224 --> 01:01:26,976
You just went into a grocery store.

535
01:01:27,268 --> 01:01:29,270
Instructor Jeong and Na-ri are inside.

536
01:01:30,063 --> 01:01:32,774
<i>I'll be right there.</i>
<i>Keep tailing her. Don't lose her.</i>

537
01:01:32,857 --> 01:01:33,941
<i>You can do it, right?</i>

538
01:01:34,484 --> 01:01:37,612
Gosh, you can count on me.
I'm the Unbreakable Sword.

539
01:01:46,454 --> 01:01:50,750
Hey, why didn't you bring your car
when you have so many?

540
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:53,086
Because they're all two-seaters.

541
01:01:53,169 --> 01:01:55,421
Then Tae-eul and I can take your car.

542
01:01:56,047 --> 01:01:58,049
Darn it. You got me with that one.

543
01:01:58,758 --> 01:02:00,468
Then what if it's a one-seater?

544
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:01,928
Then I'll take the car.

545
01:02:02,261 --> 01:02:03,429
But it's my car.

546
01:02:03,596 --> 01:02:05,973
The two-seater too. They're all my cars.

547
01:02:06,891 --> 01:02:09,811
Hey, there are two cars,
yet only three people can get in?

548
01:02:10,353 --> 01:02:11,979
Why would you bring such cars?

549
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:24,534
Are you two always like this?

550
01:02:25,618 --> 01:02:29,997
Does Jeong Tae-eul always listen

551
01:02:30,832 --> 01:02:32,917
to these tear-jerkingly lame jokes?

552
01:02:35,002 --> 01:02:36,087
What's with her?

553
01:02:38,548 --> 01:02:42,093
I was wondering
why she kept telling me to buy beef.

554
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:45,471
It sounds like she's losing it a little.

555
01:03:15,626 --> 01:03:16,502
Dad.

556
01:03:17,837 --> 01:03:18,671
Na-ri.

557
01:04:05,092 --> 01:04:06,552
Didn't I warn you?

558
01:04:08,387 --> 01:04:09,972
That you'd die

559
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:12,350
if we crossed paths.

560
01:04:35,414 --> 01:04:36,332
Let go.

561
01:04:38,334 --> 01:04:39,252
Your dad said

562
01:04:40,545 --> 01:04:42,588
he'll head out later to patrol the area,

563
01:04:44,715 --> 01:04:49,095
but I saw some punks
who looked like hoodlums going that way.

564
01:04:52,098 --> 01:04:53,099
Why?

565
01:04:55,768 --> 01:04:57,687
You've never lost anyone in your life?

566
01:05:00,648 --> 01:05:02,525
Then you should get used to it.

567
01:05:05,069 --> 01:05:06,153
I've been

568
01:05:08,406 --> 01:05:10,825
losing something every single day.

569
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:29,487
<i>This is the Police Control Room.</i>

570
01:06:31,072 --> 01:06:33,199
This is Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

571
01:06:34,492 --> 01:06:36,243
Please send backup.

572
01:06:37,578 --> 01:06:40,956
I'm near Hyoja-ro 13-gil.

573
01:06:41,666 --> 01:06:44,335
Send a patrol car at once.

574
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:12,279
<i>Sir!</i>

575
01:07:13,864 --> 01:07:15,199
You, the man on the horse.

576
01:07:51,152 --> 01:07:51,986
Finally,

577
01:07:55,448 --> 01:07:56,699
we meet.

578
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:00,453
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

579
01:08:05,374 --> 01:08:06,876
Hold him, Jeong Tae-eul.

580
01:08:09,587 --> 01:08:11,172
Hold him in your arms.

581
01:08:16,761 --> 01:08:19,180
You really came.

582
01:08:20,431 --> 01:08:21,640
To Gwanghwamun.

583
01:08:24,769 --> 01:08:27,229
And you're wearing a jacket
with a lot of buttons.

584
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:36,906
This is strange.

585
01:08:38,991 --> 01:08:40,409
You seem to know me.

586
01:08:48,083 --> 01:08:50,211
<i>When it's fate, there are no coincidences.</i>

587
01:08:51,378 --> 01:08:53,380
<i>It is inevitable by nature,</i>

588
01:08:55,758 --> 01:08:57,718
<i>but when you realize its meaning,</i>

589
01:08:59,261 --> 01:09:01,222
<i>it's always too late.</i>

590
01:09:02,932 --> 01:09:03,974
Let's skip that.

591
01:09:06,477 --> 01:09:09,605
If I don't do this now,
I'll probably regret it later.

592

<i>I am waiting for someone.</i>

594

<i>Is there no way for us to change fate?</i>

595
01:10:03,576 --> 01:10:06,203
<i>I'm sorry that I keep making you wait.</i>

596
01:10:06,287 --> 01:10:08,080

<i>-We...</i>

599
01:10:13,168 --> 01:10:14,545

<i>Let's just not save the world.</i>

601

Where's <i>Manpasikjeok?</i>

602
01:10:18,424 --> 01:10:20,092
Where's Lieutenant Jeong right now?

603
01:10:20,175 --> 01:10:21,760
<i>Even if the door closes...</i>

604
01:10:22,469 --> 01:10:24,096
<i>I promise I will return to you.</i>
