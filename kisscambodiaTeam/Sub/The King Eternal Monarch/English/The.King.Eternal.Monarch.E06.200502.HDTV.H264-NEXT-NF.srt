1
00:00:00,055 --> 00:00:04,898
THE KING: ETERNAL MONARCH

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,419
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:07,502 --> 00:00:09,922
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,926
<i>Ma'am.</i>

5
00:00:18,096 --> 00:00:21,600
The royal helicopter was just approved to
make an emergency landing on KU Building.

6
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:23,810
His Majesty is coming to Seoul?

7
00:00:23,894 --> 00:00:24,978
At this hour?

8
00:00:25,062 --> 00:00:27,731
Men usually do this when their girlfriends
miss the last train or bus.

9
00:00:28,315 --> 00:00:31,109
When their girlfriends went to Seoul
and missed the last train back to Busan.

10
00:00:31,193 --> 00:00:34,237
But there's no way
His Majesty has a girlfriend.

11
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:36,073
What could it be?

12
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,876
Did you have an appointment with her?

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,919
No way.

14
00:00:49,002 --> 00:00:50,712
I'm here to pick you up.

15
00:00:51,713 --> 00:00:53,090
But I have to keep a low profile.

16
00:00:54,257 --> 00:00:56,093
If they see you, just who are they
going to think that you are?

17
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:58,637
Don't worry.

18
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:00,889
I will try not to look suspicious.

19
00:01:03,016 --> 00:01:03,892
You are a fool.

20
00:01:04,601 --> 00:01:06,228
The situation is already quite suspicious.

21
00:01:14,027 --> 00:01:16,780
I'm seeing you at an unexpected hour,
in an unexpected place

22
00:01:17,364 --> 00:01:18,907
with an unexpected person, Your Majesty.

23
00:01:19,408 --> 00:01:20,617
You're right.

24
00:01:21,243 --> 00:01:23,161
And you've put me in an awkward situation.

25
00:01:25,163 --> 00:01:26,456
This is a very personal occasion.

26
00:01:27,124 --> 00:01:28,959
I should have given you a heads-up

27
00:01:29,584 --> 00:01:31,003
since you would be notified of this.

28
00:01:31,378 --> 00:01:32,713
I'm sorry I kept you at work.

29
00:01:34,089 --> 00:01:37,092
When it comes to the country’s affairs,
personal occasions are business too

30
00:01:37,592 --> 00:01:38,969
And you are my country.

31
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:44,099
Nice to meet you.

32
00:01:44,182 --> 00:01:46,601
I'm Koo Seo-ryeong, the Prime Minister
of the Kingdom of Corea.

33
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:54,651
It's nice to meet you.

34
00:01:55,235 --> 00:01:56,653
I'm a big fan.

35
00:01:58,447 --> 00:01:59,614
I'm flattered

36
00:02:00,323 --> 00:02:02,367
to have such a young and beautiful fan.

37
00:02:03,452 --> 00:02:04,828
May I ask your name?

38
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:10,751
I'm a traveler.

39
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,254
I'm honored
just to be able to see you like this.

40
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,131
I'm leaving soon.

41
00:02:19,926 --> 00:02:22,012
This is my first time
in the Kingdom of Corea.

42
00:02:23,055 --> 00:02:24,264
I feel like I'm in a storybook.

43
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:28,727
It's your first time here,
but you speak our language well.

44
00:02:30,812 --> 00:02:31,897
Well...

45
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,107
I studied liberal arts.

46
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:41,114
Let's call it a day, Prime Minister Koo.

47
00:02:41,948 --> 00:02:43,366
I don't have much time today.

48
00:02:45,952 --> 00:02:47,454
You have a long journey ahead.

49
00:02:47,954 --> 00:02:49,456
After you, Your Majesty.

50
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:51,208
I will send you off.

51
00:02:52,084 --> 00:02:54,503
Okay, then. See you on Friday.

52
00:02:55,837 --> 00:02:57,464
-Let's go.
-Okay.

53
00:03:47,806 --> 00:03:49,850
Are you worried
I might fall for Prime Minister Koo?

54
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:51,184
Don't worry.

55
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:54,312
<i>I know someone prettier.</i>

56
00:03:57,816 --> 00:03:58,859
That's right.

57
00:03:59,526 --> 00:04:00,777
She's that person.

58
00:04:01,653 --> 00:04:02,988
Your gaze was saying a lot.

59
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:05,448
Wow.

60
00:04:08,702 --> 00:04:09,870
What are you looking at?

61
00:04:11,037 --> 00:04:13,498
The moons are the same.

62
00:04:14,249 --> 00:04:15,333
Do you also have...

63
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,796
Later.

64
00:04:28,555 --> 00:04:29,431
What?

65
00:04:36,938 --> 00:04:38,106
<i>Do we also have what?</i>

66
00:04:44,988 --> 00:04:48,116
<i>Do you also have the myth
about rabbits living on the moon?</i>

67
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:56,833
<i>There are no rabbits on the moon,
liberal arts student.</i>

68
00:04:57,417 --> 00:04:59,544
<i>The moon is
the closest celestial body to the earth--</i>

69
00:05:05,217 --> 00:05:08,762
<i>The surface of the moon
is covered with regolith.</i>

70
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,952
I smile for you. But you...

71
00:05:36,748 --> 00:05:38,792
You smile at moments like that.

72
00:06:07,654 --> 00:06:08,697
Why are we in the kitchen?

73
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:11,324
Are you going to have me sleep
here tonight?

74
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:15,328
If you're staying the night,
I will have you sleep in my bedroom.

75
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:18,957
Now that Secretary Mo knows,
almost everyone around me knows about you.

76
00:06:24,421 --> 00:06:25,338
Let's eat.

77
00:06:26,214 --> 00:06:27,340
Yeong told me

78
00:06:27,424 --> 00:06:30,010
that you didn't eat anything
but one sandwich the whole day.

79
00:06:35,098 --> 00:06:36,141
I'm repaying you

80
00:06:37,058 --> 00:06:38,184
for the half and half.

81
00:07:10,717 --> 00:07:12,761
You didn't give me money
on purpose, right?

82
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,971
You knew we had different currencies.

83
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:17,182
Right.

84
00:07:18,016 --> 00:07:19,392
You don't have buttons.

85
00:07:23,146 --> 00:07:24,606
I didn't want you to go far away.

86
00:07:25,523 --> 00:07:26,775
That's why I sent Yeong.

87
00:07:30,028 --> 00:07:31,404
The credit limit was 100,000 won.

88
00:07:32,113 --> 00:07:33,865
I borrowed it from him,
so pay it back for me.

89
00:07:34,657 --> 00:07:35,658
I will.

90
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,456
I was

91
00:07:42,207 --> 00:07:44,417
traveling around today,

92
00:07:47,462 --> 00:07:50,256
and I realized you must have been
lonely in my world.

93
00:07:54,094 --> 00:07:56,429
Were you lonely here?

94
00:07:57,389 --> 00:07:59,724
It was frustrating to not have something

95
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,394
that could prove my identity.

96
00:08:03,353 --> 00:08:04,687
Thanks for coming to pick me up.

97
00:08:07,065 --> 00:08:08,316
Would you come here for a second?

98
00:08:14,406 --> 00:08:15,865
-Do you need any help?
-Look at me.

99
00:08:22,455 --> 00:08:25,417
I want to pat your head,
but both my hands are busy.

100
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:33,591
It doesn't seem like your first time.

101
00:08:34,342 --> 00:08:36,302
What do you mean? Dating?

102
00:08:36,553 --> 00:08:38,596
Why? You didn't get any results
from web-searching?

103
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:43,601
Why do you cook so well?

104
00:08:44,185 --> 00:08:45,812
I thought you were making me
some instant noodles.

105
00:08:45,937 --> 00:08:47,105
You said it didn't taste good.

106
00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:48,982
It was good.

107
00:08:50,358 --> 00:08:53,069
That's why I didn't believe
that you cooked it yourself.

108
00:08:53,653 --> 00:08:55,321
Head Court Lady Noh taught me how to cook.

109
00:08:57,115 --> 00:09:00,076
The only food that I don't have to
have tasted is the food I cooked.

110
00:09:01,536 --> 00:09:02,704
I saw you looked it up online.

111
00:09:03,371 --> 00:09:05,498
"Prince Imperial Geum" and "Lee Lim."

112
00:09:14,424 --> 00:09:15,300
You...

113
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,428
seem to have grown into a fine man.

114
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:28,897
I guess you now know

115
00:09:30,565 --> 00:09:32,692
what root you are standing in front of.

116
00:09:43,953 --> 00:09:44,954
It's my hell

117
00:09:45,997 --> 00:09:47,081
and my history

118
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,210
that was engraved on my body

119
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:54,631
by the greed of the person
that killed my father and strangled me.

120
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,177
Which is why I was raised
amid my uncle's worries

121
00:09:59,427 --> 00:10:01,179
and Head Court Lady Noh's tears.

122
00:10:02,472 --> 00:10:05,266
And that's the reason
why Head Court Lady Noh isn't nice to you.

123
00:10:06,184 --> 00:10:07,477
Don't be upset about it.

124
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:12,607
Is that it?

125
00:10:13,358 --> 00:10:17,111
After hearing a story like this,
don't you have to either give me a hug

126
00:10:17,695 --> 00:10:19,239
or at least say you would give me one?

127
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:29,207
Aren't you going to show me my ID card?

128
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:33,253
I need to go now.

129
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:40,301
I won't let you go.

130
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:43,054
You have to live here.

131
00:10:46,182 --> 00:10:47,892
I'm serious. I won't let you go.

132
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:50,728
I can keep you here

133
00:10:54,148 --> 00:10:55,316
with just one command.

134
00:11:07,912 --> 00:11:08,913
What are you doing?

135
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:10,915
Well, I heard from the news earlier

136
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,751
that there will be a cold wave
starting from tonight.

137
00:11:14,752 --> 00:11:17,213
It'd be nice to take you to my place,
but you won't.

138
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:20,717
Can I not watch the news
in the night duty room?

139
00:11:21,426 --> 00:11:23,636
My mom bought this
from a pyramid scheme company.

140
00:11:24,512 --> 00:11:28,057
It doesn't mean she's into it.
She only purchased their product.

141
00:11:29,392 --> 00:11:33,896
But it's really soft and warm.

142
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:38,067
Blankets are innocent.

143
00:11:39,736 --> 00:11:42,071
It kind of looks like
it's paying for its sins though.

144
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:46,409
What's that?

145
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:50,455
I have it on when I sleep.
Lavender helps you sleep soundly.

146
00:11:51,831 --> 00:11:54,626
You sleep with things like that
every night?

147
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,544
Yes.

148
00:11:58,546 --> 00:12:00,965
Actually, I grew up sheltered and--

149
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:01,924
Get out.

150
00:12:02,008 --> 00:12:04,010
Okay. I will see you tomorrow.

151
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:11,601
Good night.

152
00:12:23,571 --> 00:12:26,074
VIOLENT CRIMES DIVISION SQUAD 3

153
00:12:40,588 --> 00:12:42,215
Hello, is this the police?

154
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:47,178
I'm behind the playground
near Samjung Apartment Complex.

155
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:49,764
Six boys are beating one kid.

156
00:12:49,847 --> 00:12:51,474
Is she crazy?

157
00:12:51,974 --> 00:12:55,019
Hey, hang up the phone already.
Do you want to die?

158
00:12:55,103 --> 00:12:58,898
Yes. I'm Jeong Tae-eul,
a student of Bukchon High.

159
00:12:58,981 --> 00:13:02,360
The six bullies are wearing
the uniforms of my school.

160
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:05,697
What are you waiting for?
Go take her phone.

161
00:13:11,369 --> 00:13:12,995
You crazy bitch. Do you have a death wish?

162
00:13:31,472 --> 00:13:32,348
Hey.

163
00:13:32,432 --> 00:13:34,350
I know your face

164
00:13:35,017 --> 00:13:36,436
and I know where you live.

165
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:41,107
Hey!

166
00:13:42,358 --> 00:13:44,152
I know your face too.

167
00:13:44,777 --> 00:13:46,696
So don't you think of fleeing.

168
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:49,282
I'm a black belt.

169
00:13:50,366 --> 00:13:52,535
But when it's two against six,
it counts as self-defense.

170
00:13:53,035 --> 00:13:54,704
I don't go easy on men.

171
00:14:06,632 --> 00:14:09,469
It's your fault. You've spoiled him!

172
00:14:13,806 --> 00:14:15,516
We should probably have
the kid transferred.

173
00:14:17,393 --> 00:14:18,686
Seriously, when will you grow up?

174
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:34,410
Where are you going?

175
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:36,078
None of your business. Out of the way.

176
00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:38,247
I said where are you going?

177
00:14:38,831 --> 00:14:40,249
Anywhere. Why?

178
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,376
Why would you go anywhere?

179
00:14:55,181 --> 00:14:56,182
Come to this place.

180
00:14:56,974 --> 00:14:59,310
Come and start over from a white belt.

181
00:15:01,312 --> 00:15:05,066
Courtesy, integrity, perseverance,
self-control and indomitable spirit.

182
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,901
You are not following any of these.

183
00:15:09,153 --> 00:15:11,113
I had perseverance.
That's why I let them beat me.

184
00:15:17,203 --> 00:15:18,746
Then you can start with a yellow belt.

185
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,582
I can't cut you any more slack.
Put them on.

186
00:15:37,557 --> 00:15:41,435
HEROES TAEKWONDO CENTER

187
00:15:44,939 --> 00:15:47,692
VIOLENT CRIMES DIVISION SQUAD 3

188
00:16:00,413 --> 00:16:01,330
Yes.

189
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:04,959
Yes.

190
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,257
Did you check the facts?

191
00:16:13,342 --> 00:16:14,635
Okay.

192
00:16:19,682 --> 00:16:21,183
Summon the NSC right now

193
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:22,894
and cancel
all the appointments for tomorrow.

194
00:16:29,525 --> 00:16:31,736
I thought you'd need it,
so I made it easy for you.

195
00:16:32,236 --> 00:16:34,030
I'm sure you won't find anything, though.

196
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,491
<i>We have our eyes on her too</i>

197
00:16:37,575 --> 00:16:40,453
because she's committed
various crimes like theft and assault.

198
00:16:40,536 --> 00:16:41,871
What is she called again?

199
00:16:41,954 --> 00:16:42,872
Luna.

200
00:16:43,205 --> 00:16:45,166
You know, the one
we were chasing last time.

201
00:16:47,251 --> 00:16:48,127
Captain Jo.

202
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:54,008
Sorry I had you come
all the way to the palace.

203
00:16:54,091 --> 00:16:56,260
Don't worry. I was on my way home anyway.

204
00:16:57,261 --> 00:16:58,888
This is what I talked about on the phone.

205
00:17:01,182 --> 00:17:03,893
I will get back to you
as soon as we find a match.

206
00:17:04,685 --> 00:17:05,561
Okay.

207
00:17:09,106 --> 00:17:12,109
MINISTRY OF NATIONAL SECURITY
NSC SUMMONED AT 10 P.M.

208
00:17:15,237 --> 00:17:16,447
-I will be waiting.
-Okay.

209
00:17:23,704 --> 00:17:24,580
Take your time.

210
00:17:25,581 --> 00:17:28,167
I will show you the ID card
after you finish it.

211
00:17:31,504 --> 00:17:32,463
Thanks for the food.

212
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:43,432
Steak and rice in a hot pot.
It's my signature dish.

213
00:17:44,016 --> 00:17:45,476
Everyone fell for it.

214
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:47,436
I can see why.

215
00:17:48,604 --> 00:17:50,523
You should ask me whom I cooked it for.

216
00:17:51,107 --> 00:17:52,692
I said it to make you jealous.

217
00:17:55,569 --> 00:17:56,862
I can't beat that person anyway.

218
00:17:58,197 --> 00:18:01,283
Whoever it is,
that person must be from this world.

219
00:18:22,304 --> 00:18:24,432
I have been carrying it around
ever since you came here.

220
00:18:25,433 --> 00:18:28,060
I didn't show it to you
because I was afraid you might leave.

221
00:18:28,644 --> 00:18:29,687
But...

222
00:18:31,564 --> 00:18:34,066
you've already gone somewhere
much further away than your world.

223
00:18:40,364 --> 00:18:41,407
Take a look.

224
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:48,956
JEONG TAE-EUL
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

225
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:52,168
The navy jacket.

226
00:18:53,627 --> 00:18:54,503
It's mine.

227
00:18:55,504 --> 00:18:56,797
It's my ID card.

228
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:01,677
How does this make sense though?

229
00:19:02,678 --> 00:19:03,929
It's definitely mine.

230
00:19:04,764 --> 00:19:06,891
Did you say it's been here for 25 years?

231
00:19:10,686 --> 00:19:12,855
<i>Someone dropped it here.</i>

232
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,609
But my memories are fading away.

233
00:19:17,985 --> 00:19:20,362
I'm not sure
if I can recognize that person.

234
00:19:22,114 --> 00:19:22,948
But

235
00:19:24,408 --> 00:19:26,869
I feel like the person will appear
before me at least once.

236
00:19:27,578 --> 00:19:28,412
Why?

237
00:19:28,496 --> 00:19:30,539
Because that person
is either the beginning

238
00:19:31,832 --> 00:19:33,084
or the end of all this.

239
00:19:36,504 --> 00:19:38,422
It seems like
a difficult question to solve,

240
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:41,092
but there must be
a simple and beautiful formula for it.

241
00:19:42,635 --> 00:19:44,720
And you are the answer
I have been looking for.

242
00:19:44,804 --> 00:19:46,931
From now on, I will prove it one by one.

243
00:19:47,807 --> 00:19:50,017
Whoever it is,
and whichever world the person is from,

244
00:19:51,602 --> 00:19:52,853
you've beat that person.

245
00:19:54,647 --> 00:19:57,942
So don't you decide alone
to leave like that.

246
00:20:13,082 --> 00:20:14,041
Your Majesty.

247
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,502
Prime Minister Koo has assembled the NSC.

248
00:20:18,587 --> 00:20:20,172
I wanted to send you back in the morning,

249
00:20:20,256 --> 00:20:22,174
but I guess I should let you go
earlier than that.

250
00:20:22,758 --> 00:20:24,760
I don't think I can see you off.

251
00:20:24,844 --> 00:20:25,970
Don't worry about me.

252
00:20:26,804 --> 00:20:29,431
NSC is the National Security Council.

253
00:20:30,766 --> 00:20:31,934
Did something happen?

254
00:20:32,226 --> 00:20:36,689
<i>At 2230 hours, the battleships
of the Japanese Navy led by the Aegis</i>

255
00:20:36,772 --> 00:20:38,858
<i>are moving toward
the south-southeast of Dokdo.</i>

256
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:42,486
<i>Prime Minister Koo urgently assembled
the NSC to respond</i>

257
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,698
<i>to Japan's unusual activity,
foreshowing a strong response.</i>

258
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:00,004
<i>This is a strict warning.</i>

259
00:21:00,087 --> 00:21:02,756
<i>Your ship is near the territorial waters
of the Kingdom of Corea now.</i>

260
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,383
<i>Stop sailing further.</i>

261
00:21:04,592 --> 00:21:06,010
<i>We are warning you again.</i>

262
00:21:06,093 --> 00:21:07,511
<i>Stop sailing further.</i>

263
00:21:09,471 --> 00:21:11,432
Japan insists that the search radar
the Yi Sun-sin Destroyer

264
00:21:11,515 --> 00:21:13,851
used to search fishing boats
is a fire control radar

265
00:21:13,934 --> 00:21:16,312
and it shows the Kingdom of Corea's
intention of attack.

266
00:21:16,395 --> 00:21:18,689
What about the Chinese fishing boat?
Is it rescued?

267
00:21:19,356 --> 00:21:20,858
It's still underway.

268
00:21:20,941 --> 00:21:23,360
The weather condition of the East Sea
is poor at the moment.

269
00:21:23,444 --> 00:21:25,654
If Prime Minister Koo reaches out to me,
put me on the phone.

270
00:21:25,738 --> 00:21:26,614
Yes, Your Majesty.

271
00:21:28,365 --> 00:21:30,284
Please bring my guest's belongings first.

272
00:21:30,743 --> 00:21:32,453
And I will explain the situation myself.

273
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,330
Yes, Your Majesty.

274
00:21:56,602 --> 00:21:57,478
What's this?

275
00:22:03,651 --> 00:22:05,486
JEONG TAE-EUL

276
00:22:09,907 --> 00:22:11,200
<i>This is the control room.</i>

277
00:22:11,659 --> 00:22:15,287
It's me. Could you please confirm

278
00:22:15,454 --> 00:22:18,165
if someone went into my room
since last night?

279
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:19,875
<i>That would be difficult.</i>

280
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:23,170
<i>As you requested,
we've had Gwangyeongjeon restricted</i>

281
00:22:23,295 --> 00:22:25,422
<i>from everyone in the palace
since 8 p.m. yesterday.</i>

282
00:22:25,589 --> 00:22:26,966
<i>All the CCTVs are off as well.</i>

283
00:22:27,258 --> 00:22:28,676
<i>Did something happen?</i>

284
00:22:29,885 --> 00:22:31,178
I will call you back.

285
00:22:40,813 --> 00:22:42,773
According to the rules of engagement,

286
00:22:42,856 --> 00:22:46,026
we made a warning announcement
and are now defending ourselves.

287
00:22:47,027 --> 00:22:47,945
I see.

288
00:22:48,904 --> 00:22:50,489
What are the features
of the Japanese battleships?

289
00:22:54,576 --> 00:22:58,539
On the Japanese Aegis ship,
SM-2, SM-3, and SM-6 are loaded

290
00:22:58,622 --> 00:23:00,833
as well as ASROC.

291
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:02,584
And ASROC is--

292
00:23:02,668 --> 00:23:04,420
It's an antisubmarine missile.

293
00:23:06,005 --> 00:23:07,673
That's right.

294
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,384
-We have it too, don't we?
-Yes, we do.

295
00:23:10,968 --> 00:23:14,179
We sent an Aegis
that is loaded with Tomahawk as well.

296
00:23:14,388 --> 00:23:15,514
Prime Minister Koo.

297
00:23:15,597 --> 00:23:17,808
This isn't the first time
Japan has done this.

298
00:23:17,891 --> 00:23:21,729
Why don't we talk them into going back
for the sake of our relationship?

299
00:23:22,104 --> 00:23:24,273
We can't start a war
every time this happens.

300
00:23:24,356 --> 00:23:26,275
Maybe it keeps happening

301
00:23:26,358 --> 00:23:28,235
because we never have started a war.

302
00:23:29,653 --> 00:23:30,946
This is the third time this year.

303
00:23:32,114 --> 00:23:34,241
The first two times,
we talked them into going back.

304
00:23:34,825 --> 00:23:37,619
And this time,
they came back with an Aegis ship.

305
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:40,706
What do you think will happen
the fourth time?

306
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:43,542
We don't know until it happens.

307
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:46,128
They are just throwing a tantrum
before the trade negotiation.

308
00:23:46,211 --> 00:23:48,464
War isn't easy.

309
00:23:48,797 --> 00:23:50,799
Let's make more warning announcements
and wait.

310
00:23:50,883 --> 00:23:52,009
Wait for what?

311
00:23:52,426 --> 00:23:53,761
Did we order food?

312
00:23:56,555 --> 00:23:59,641
The Japanese Navy is now sailing toward
our territorial waters.

313
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:02,478
At this rate, they will enter
our territorial waters in 20 minutes.

314
00:24:02,978 --> 00:24:03,854
You all heard that.

315
00:24:05,022 --> 00:24:08,108
If you want to wait,
do so when you become the Prime Minister.

316
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:10,611
I will not stand anymore.

317
00:24:11,653 --> 00:24:13,614
I want all the troops
to prepare for action.

318
00:24:13,697 --> 00:24:14,740
Prime Minister Koo.

319
00:24:14,823 --> 00:24:17,242
You know we need
the permission of His Majesty.

320
00:24:17,326 --> 00:24:18,660
I do.

321
00:24:19,203 --> 00:24:20,204
Call the Royal Palace.

322
00:24:20,788 --> 00:24:23,332
<i>The Aegis and three more battleships
of the Japanese Navy</i>

323
00:24:23,457 --> 00:24:25,584
<i>are currently sailing toward
our territorial waters.</i>

324
00:24:26,085 --> 00:24:28,087
<i>I commanded our troops
to prepare for action.</i>

325
00:24:28,754 --> 00:24:31,006
<i>Of course, there is a lot of opposition.</i>

326
00:24:31,173 --> 00:24:33,717
Politics must not be considered
regarding national security.

327
00:24:33,801 --> 00:24:35,177
Did you do so?

328
00:24:35,594 --> 00:24:38,764
<i>The future of our 400,000 soldiers
and 90 million citizens is on the line.</i>

329
00:24:39,056 --> 00:24:40,641
<i>No political idea was taken into account.</i>

330
00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:44,728
If you say so,
I was thinking of a different approach.

331
00:24:45,854 --> 00:24:47,356
<i>By "a different approach," do you mean...</i>

332
00:24:49,233 --> 00:24:51,151
I will do just as my ancestors did.

333
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,694
Your Majesty.

334
00:24:52,778 --> 00:24:55,072
When two countries are true to themselves,
a war breaks out.

335
00:24:55,948 --> 00:24:57,616
Japan is true to themselves,

336
00:24:58,367 --> 00:24:59,952
so we must be true to ourselves too.

337
00:25:01,286 --> 00:25:02,621
We won't sit back and watch.

338
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:09,837
Not even by 1cm and 1mm can Japan enter

339
00:25:11,338 --> 00:25:12,756
our territorial waters.

340
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,472
Your Majesty.

341
00:25:21,473 --> 00:25:23,308
I know you're busy at the moment,

342
00:25:23,892 --> 00:25:26,895
but something in the palace was stolen.

343
00:25:27,396 --> 00:25:30,524
The guest's ID card is gone.

344
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:35,487
I tried my best to keep it secure,
but I guess it wasn't enough.

345
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,824
I will find out who did it and--

346
00:25:38,907 --> 00:25:39,783
Head Court Lady Noh.

347
00:25:40,951 --> 00:25:42,619
I know this might sound odd,

348
00:25:44,037 --> 00:25:46,290
and I can't explain why,

349
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,003
but I somehow feel that everything
that is happening now was meant to be

350
00:25:51,587 --> 00:25:53,088
and they were set in motion 25 years ago.

351
00:25:54,423 --> 00:25:58,927
Why are you suddenly saying that?

352
00:26:00,804 --> 00:26:02,347
I will explain further when I get back.

353
00:26:03,348 --> 00:26:05,851
Just wish me good luck for now.

354
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,771
Your other talisman actually worked.

355
00:26:10,606 --> 00:26:13,525
Please take the talisman with you.

356
00:26:14,026 --> 00:26:17,946
Actually, the talisman
is supposed to be used that way.

357
00:26:26,497 --> 00:26:28,373
Could you two give us a moment?

358
00:26:56,151 --> 00:26:57,486
I will give this one to you.

359
00:26:57,569 --> 00:26:59,655
It seems it was supposed to be
passed on to you.

360
00:26:59,738 --> 00:27:01,490
I hope this doesn't put you in trouble.

361
00:27:06,537 --> 00:27:07,955
JEONG TAE-EUL
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

362
00:27:12,751 --> 00:27:13,752
So you were in the navy?

363
00:27:14,795 --> 00:27:16,505
I left the military as a Navy Lieutenant.

364
00:27:16,588 --> 00:27:18,298
I'm not sure if you'll believe this,

365
00:27:19,675 --> 00:27:21,969
but I'm the Commander-in-Chief
of the Kingdom of Corea.

366
00:27:23,345 --> 00:27:24,221
I believe you.

367
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:26,515
Finally.

368
00:27:29,393 --> 00:27:32,354
You said your country was
about to have a war with Japan.

369
00:27:32,938 --> 00:27:36,024
So this was what was happening
in the Kingdom of Corea.

370
00:27:36,108 --> 00:27:38,944
The royal family puts on military uniforms
at the most honorable time.

371
00:27:40,237 --> 00:27:41,655
It means we will certainly win.

372
00:27:42,823 --> 00:27:44,324
I will come back to you with honor.

373
00:27:44,866 --> 00:27:45,701
It won't take long.

374
00:27:48,537 --> 00:27:49,413
"Come back"?

375
00:27:50,455 --> 00:27:51,873
Will you wait for me?

376
00:27:59,256 --> 00:28:00,716
I will see you again, Gon.

377
00:28:08,348 --> 00:28:10,475
I thought my name was
not supposed to be called,

378
00:28:12,769 --> 00:28:14,855
but I guess it was supposed to be called
only by you.

379
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,596
I'M BORED, LET'S PLAY POOL

380
00:28:49,348 --> 00:28:50,390
<i>Who won the pool game?</i>

381
00:28:50,807 --> 00:28:52,601
<i>Sorry for the late reply.
I went somewhere.</i>

382
00:28:54,353 --> 00:28:55,604
<i>I'm fine if you're fine.</i>

383
00:28:56,229 --> 00:28:57,689
<i>Jangmi won the game.</i>

384
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,922
Could you wash your hands quickly
and help me with the eggs?

385
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,051
Dad.

386
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,304
You must have been startled.

387
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,515
I tried to contact you,

388
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:31,060
but I was Alice in Wonderland.

389
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,438
So I couldn't call you or anything.

390
00:29:35,314 --> 00:29:36,732
You must have been really worried.

391
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,193
I'm so sorry, Dad.

392
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:42,321
Were you not at home?

393
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:44,699
You didn't know?

394
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:45,741
No, I didn't.

395
00:29:46,492 --> 00:29:49,203
Goodness! Go peel the eggs.

396
00:29:50,204 --> 00:29:51,330
So you didn't know.

397
00:29:51,497 --> 00:29:52,832
Peel all of them.

398
00:29:53,499 --> 00:29:56,294
Where were you though?
Were you working undercover?

399
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,796
Forget it.

400
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:02,008
Hey, by the way,
the horse in the yard is gone.

401
00:30:03,342 --> 00:30:04,385
Did the owner take it back?

402
00:30:10,224 --> 00:30:11,309
Obviously, you don't care

403
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:13,895
about where your daughter went

404
00:30:14,228 --> 00:30:16,063
but you wondered where the horse went.

405
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,861
There will be no conversation
between us for some time now.

406
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,237
For a long time.

407
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,325
How could the owner
take the horse without telling me?

408
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,118
I even made him coffee.

409
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:32,830
We talked a lot in front of the horse.

410
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,124
He shouldn't have said
that he likes it here.

411
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:37,502
He could have at least said goodbye.

412
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:38,586
Gosh.

413
00:30:38,794 --> 00:30:40,505
I can't believe it.

414
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:43,799
Could you not think out loud?

415
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:46,511
How could he sneak out
with the horse like that?

416
00:30:47,094 --> 00:30:47,970
Let's eat.

417
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,055
Dad...

418
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,057
<i>He said he would come back soon,</i>

419
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,309
<i>but he didn't come back for a long time.</i>

420
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:55,311
The culprit is heading to the building!

421
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,067
Why are you coming out of there?

422
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,318
I'm sorry, sir!

423
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,084
Damn it. Where should I go?

424
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:19,669
Not there.

425
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,295
No, no. Okay!

426
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,509
Where? Okay.

427
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:33,683
You brat!

428
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,157
<i>I wasn't holding my phone</i>

429
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:52,618
<i>as if I was waiting for someone.</i>

430
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,914
<i>I was just waiting on Earth,</i>

431
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,875
<i>which has become slightly rounder.</i>

432
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,546
<i>There was no way I could know</i>

433
00:32:04,046 --> 00:32:05,756
<i>what was happening in his world.</i>

434
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:12,138
<i>Because he was a person
who was beyond one and zero.</i>

435
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,761
His Majesty is on board!

436
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:58,559
I wished I could come back as a reserve,
but here I am, Captain.

437
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,144
I knew you would come like this.

438
00:33:00,227 --> 00:33:01,187
I will be

439
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:04,815
the last crew to leave this ship today.

440
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:07,818
Please protect the sea of Corea.

441
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,279
The navy of the Kingdom of Corea
wins before fighting.

442
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,573
I'm honored to have you fight with us.

443
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:16,494
This is the King's Flag.

444
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:19,747
Lieutenant Commander Han Jun-yeol.
I receive the King's Flag.

445
00:33:21,707 --> 00:33:23,959
Attention!

446
00:33:24,543 --> 00:33:26,962
Salute the King!

447
00:33:27,129 --> 00:33:28,464
-Salute!
-Salute!

448
00:33:40,976 --> 00:33:43,688
<i>And the Chinese government expresses
remorse that Japan has almost caused</i>

449
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,106
<i>the death of Chinese citizens</i>

450
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:48,234
<i>and escalated the situation
to the current standoff.</i>

451
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:52,571
The Chinese government expressed
deep remorse that Japan caused

452
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:55,116
a confrontation which might
result in civilian casualties.

453
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:59,829
The anchor asked the reason for Japan's
provocation and the reporter is answering.

454
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:03,958
Your Highness, we will see
if there's an earlier flight.

455
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:05,668
Sounds good.

456
00:34:05,751 --> 00:34:07,253
<i>It could also be a strategy
to soothe the citizens</i>

457
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,922
<i>who are dissatisfied
with their economic policies.</i>

458
00:34:10,005 --> 00:34:12,925
<i>Prostests in Japan are spreading
nationwide</i>

459
00:34:13,258 --> 00:34:15,344
<i>due to long term econiomic crisis.</i>

460
00:34:16,136 --> 00:34:18,430
<i>It appears that PM Mitsuda</i>

461
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:22,476
<i>has taken this crisis as an opportunity
to improve the economy,</i>

462
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,563
<i>resulting in military tension
with the Kingdom of Corea.</i>

463
00:34:28,482 --> 00:34:31,110
Yes, according to the 2018...

464
00:34:31,193 --> 00:34:33,362
They might've assumed
that a female Prime Minister

465
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,197
who doesn't have any knowledge of war

466
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,491
would choose negotiation
over confrontation.

467
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,119
I've always been the first to strike
when someone looks at me funny.

468
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,413
Prime Minister Mitsuda has made a mistake.

469
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,291
We have an ace in the hole.

470
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,088
His Majesty got on
the Yi Sun-sin Destroyer.

471
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,256
What?

472
00:34:52,923 --> 00:34:53,758
But...

473
00:35:00,806 --> 00:35:02,850
<i>Current position.
Longitude 131.53 degrees east.</i>

474
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,977
<i>Latitude 37.15 degrees north.</i>

475
00:35:05,227 --> 00:35:07,855
<i>Distance to the enemy, 2,500 yards.
Direction, 20 degrees.</i>

476
00:35:07,938 --> 00:35:10,566
<i>Distance to the enemy, 2,400 yards.
Direction, 20 degrees.</i>

477
00:35:10,649 --> 00:35:13,277
<i>Distance to the enemy, 2,300 yards.
Direction, 20 degrees.</i>

478
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,029
The weather doesn't seem good.

479
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,530
Wave height?

480
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:20,659
Currently, it's below 1m,
but it's rising quickly.

481
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,832
Captain, we might be able
to take advantage of the sea state.

482
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,254
We are going to win anyway,
so let's do it quickly.

483
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:35,966
Yes, Your Majesty.
The entire fleet is ready for action.

484
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:36,967
Good.

485
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,139
Hoist the King's Flag.
The entire fleet will go full speed ahead.

486
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:45,142
Full speed ahead to both sides.

487
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,812
-Full speed ahead to both sides!
-Full speed ahead to both sides!

488
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:04,453
General, all ships of the Kingdom of Corea
started to maneuver.

489
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,081
Starboard observation report.

490
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,291
Direction, 270 degrees.

491
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,210
We have located a flag on an enemy's ship.

492
00:36:11,293 --> 00:36:12,753
A flag?

493
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:28,853
That's

494
00:36:29,311 --> 00:36:31,397
the Kingdom of Corea's King's Flag.

495
00:36:32,314 --> 00:36:38,195
That King's Flag means
that the King himself is on the ship.

496
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,114
Report to the Headquarters.

497
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:41,448
Yes, sir.

498
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,202
Connect me to the Headquarters.

499
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,833
Sir, this is
the General of the First Fleet,

500
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,293
Omura.

501
00:36:53,043 --> 00:36:56,297
We have been outfoxed
by the King of Corea.

502
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,715
<i>Come to your senses.</i>

503
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,967
This is not a crisis, but an opportunity.

504
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,636
Since their king is on board,

505
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,556
they will focus on their defense
instead of attacking.

506
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,143
<i>Push your ships 1,000 yards into
the Kingdom of Corea's territorial waters.</i>

507
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,729
Let the world watch

508
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,732
the King of Corea run away like a coward.

509
00:37:15,357 --> 00:37:16,734
-<i>Omura.</i>
-Yes, sir.

510
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,572
All ships sail 1,000 yards into
the Kingdom of Corea's territorial waters.

511
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:24,158
All ships full speed ahead!

512
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,251
Dear God.

513
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,921
Please help us.

514
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:41,091
Please grant my Lord the fortune of war.

515
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,512
Please let my desperation
take the wind away

516
00:37:46,096 --> 00:37:50,476
and please let my prayer
bring victory to him on the waves.

517
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,187
Dear God.

518
00:37:53,687 --> 00:37:55,606
Please help us.

519
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,319
Please grant my Lord the fortune of war.

520
00:38:01,695 --> 00:38:04,156
Distance to the enemy, 1,500 yards.
Direction, 10 degrees.

521
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,700
Territorial waters violated by 700 yards.

522
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,619
We should have stopped
His Majesty at all cost.

523
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:11,914
The enemy is so close
they are visible to the naked eye.

524
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:15,209
At this rate, we can't ensure
His Majesty's safety.

525
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:20,172
<i>You invaded the territorial waters
of the Kingdom of Corea.</i>

526
00:38:20,422 --> 00:38:22,967
<i>Leave the territorial waters
of the Kingdom of Corea.</i>

527
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,426
<i>I repeat.</i>

528
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:27,054
<i>Leave the territorial waters
of the Kingdom of Corea.</i>

529
00:38:27,137 --> 00:38:29,139
<i>Leave the territorial waters
of the Kingdom of Corea.</i>

530
00:38:29,431 --> 00:38:31,684
The enemy ships won't slow down,
Your Majesty.

531
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,352
It can be really dangerous from now on.

532
00:38:33,435 --> 00:38:35,646
We must change our strategy
and focus on defense.

533
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,649
Captain Jo. Lieutenant Commander Han.

534
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,860
From now on,
I'm the only one who worries about me.

535
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,822
What you must protect today is not me,

536
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:46,949
but this sea.

537
00:38:47,574 --> 00:38:48,826
Do you understand?

538
00:38:49,868 --> 00:38:51,412
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

539
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,789
Action stations.

540
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,710
Speed Boat Fleet 203 will
block them in the front.

541
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,130
We will press the Aegis
coming from the back.

542
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,215
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

543
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,718
<i>Action stations.</i>

544
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,803
<i>Action stations.</i>

545
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,139
-Action stations!
-Action stations!

546
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,265
Action stations!

547
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:12,558
Action stations!

548
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,059
Action stations!

549
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:17,104
<i>Follow the enemy ships!</i>

550
00:39:27,322 --> 00:39:28,574
Full speed ahead to both sides.

551
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,201
We are ready to go full speed ahead.

552
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,536
To the enemy ships!

553
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,549
Flying Squadron Six, P-3C. Attack.

554
00:39:53,932 --> 00:39:55,392
Activate the close-in weapon system.

555
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,478
-<i>Activate the close-in weapon system!</i>
-Your Majesty.

556
00:39:58,103 --> 00:40:00,230
This might be seen as an attack.

557
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:03,901
Then it's a war.

558
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:08,072
Japan is in our territorial waters.
Warning shots are a generous response.

559
00:40:08,238 --> 00:40:09,865
And it will be our last generous response.

560
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,495
I will listen to you, Major Choe.

561
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,455
Do you want to

562
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,832
stop me too?

563
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:22,795
I have been training men for 30 years
not to back off in situations like this.

564
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:24,963
Your wish is my command.

565
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,215
I will crush them.

566
00:40:27,841 --> 00:40:29,259
I knew you would say that.

567
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,225
Get ready to shoot the Aegis
from 30 yards ahead.

568
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:44,233
Get ready to shoot the Aegis
from 30 yards ahead.

569
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:54,660
Fire

570
00:40:55,452 --> 00:40:56,370
the warning shot!

571
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:09,883
Enemy ship,
Yi Sun-sin Destroyer at 800 yards.

572
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,678
Yi Sun-sin Destroyer, 700 yards.

573
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,054
Ship halted.

574
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:16,557
Captain! Guided missiles
have been detected.

575
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:21,562
The enemy ship's missiles
have aimed our ship.

576
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:27,401
They plan to shoot us if we move.

577
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:32,781
The King of the Kingdom of Corea
is determined to go to war against us.

578
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:35,075
This is the Kingdom of Corea's
territorial waters.

579
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:37,828
Things are not

580
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,581
looking good.

581
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:49,006
All ships stop maneuver.

582
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:54,094
<i>Distance to the enemy, 700 yards.
Direction, 5 degrees.</i>

583
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,804
<i>The Japanese naval fleet stopped sailing.</i>

584
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,434
It seems our message is well-conveyed.

585
00:42:01,476 --> 00:42:02,603
Let's wait a bit.

586
00:42:03,061 --> 00:42:03,937
But not too long.

587
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:42,434
IMAGINARY FLOWER

588
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,815
I bought it in that world.

589
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,526
It's made in the Kingdom of Corea.

590
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:04,873
I told you.

591
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,835
I told you there is no wind, no rain,
no sun, and no time here.

592
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,088
Flowers don't bloom here.

593
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:13,548
We don't know that

594
00:43:14,591 --> 00:43:16,718
if no one has sown seeds yet.

595
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,908
I know you're from a different world,

596
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,119
but you should sprout.

597
00:43:45,622 --> 00:43:49,084
Your friends are
in a much harsher place now.

598
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,924
IMAGINARY FLOWER

599
00:43:59,052 --> 00:44:02,264
<i>Currently at 7:40 a.m.,
the Japanese naval fleet</i>

600
00:44:02,347 --> 00:44:04,516
<i>has completely left
our territorial waters.</i>

601
00:44:06,184 --> 00:44:08,520
I would like to extend my deep respect
for the soldiers and His Majesty

602
00:44:08,603 --> 00:44:11,148
for fighting courageously for the country.

603
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:16,069
Japan will soon make an apology
and an announcement about compensation.

604
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,240
We will abide by international law
in the same circumstances

605
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,326
and fulfill our duties.

606
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:26,788
Until Japan's official apology,
the Kingdom of Corea will stop

607
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:29,916
exporting the rare-earth elements

608
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,376
to Japan.

609
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,016
The graph of your approval rating
looks amazing.

610
00:44:46,516 --> 00:44:48,101
It's sky-rocketing every minute.

611
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,355
The turbulence worked in my favor.

612
00:44:52,647 --> 00:44:55,192
It has been unnecessarily too peaceful.

613
00:44:55,817 --> 00:44:59,112
If you had not become a Prime Minister,
you would have made a lot of issues...

614
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,281
Why didn't you put on comfortable shoes?

615
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,200
These are my combat shoes.

616
00:45:04,117 --> 00:45:06,161
Have we heard from China yet?

617
00:45:06,828 --> 00:45:07,662
Right.

618
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:10,582
It seems that they would like
to visit the palace first.

619
00:45:10,832 --> 00:45:12,959
They are trying to set the date
with the royal court.

620
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,462
It seems that China is taking matters
about the visa with them.

621
00:45:15,545 --> 00:45:16,588
What's with the priority?

622
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,298
Such talk should be done with me.

623
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,258
They should just send a panda
to the royal court.

624
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:25,013
It's not a panda,
but I have a present for you.

625
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:28,809
I won a court lady over
who works for the Royal Wardrobe.

626
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:30,519
I like the package.

627
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:36,108
It seems that there has been
a mysterious guest at the palace.

628
00:45:36,691 --> 00:45:39,236
The security was strangely tight,
so no one has seen her face,

629
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:41,780
but it is assumed
that His Majesty brought her.

630
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:45,909
It's nice to meet you. I'm a big fan.

631
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:47,327
I saw her.

632
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,621
Pardon?

633
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,165
Congratulations. You were right.

634
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,501
She was young. I'm prettier though.

635
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:58,672
Next week's state administration report
will be done personally.

636
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,383
And make sure to find something
about that woman before that.

637
00:46:04,594 --> 00:46:07,556
<i>The northern K Stadium created a big buzz
even before its construction.</i>

638
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:08,849
<i>As the first-ever dome stadium,</i>

639
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:12,060
<i>it is four-stories tall,
and has two basement levels</i>

640
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,770
<i>with a seating capacity of 16,890...</i>

641
00:46:16,022 --> 00:46:17,399
K STADIUM

642
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,527
THERE ARE NO RESULTS

643
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,410
DOME STADIUM WITH 16,890 SEATS

644
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,830
THERE ARE NO RESULTS

645
00:46:40,505 --> 00:46:43,800
<i>From August 1st to 4th,
the Global Medical Center</i>

646
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:47,220
<i>will be developing a training program
for the health workforce in Thailand--</i>

647
00:46:51,224 --> 00:46:54,060
It's just the news.

648
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:59,399
Why on earth did he record the news
as a voicemail?

649
00:47:00,775 --> 00:47:03,612
Gosh, it feels so refreshing
after the workout.

650
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,323
It really does. Are you all right?

651
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:07,282
Yes, I'm all right.

652
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:08,950
What now?

653
00:47:09,242 --> 00:47:12,204
Why is she spacing out again?

654
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,582
Maybe she just checked
the physical fitness test schedule.

655
00:47:15,665 --> 00:47:18,084
Tae-eul, did you check the schedule?

656
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:20,003
We have a physical fitness test next week.

657
00:47:22,797 --> 00:47:23,673
I saw it.

658
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:25,425
Jangmi. You...

659
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,428
Have you ever searched for a person?

660
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:35,310
I have searched for run-away children,
fathers, housewives, and even dogs.

661
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,686
I specialize in run-away people.

662
00:47:37,687 --> 00:47:39,481
Is she ignoring me right now?

663
00:47:39,564 --> 00:47:40,607
Come on.

664
00:47:40,815 --> 00:47:42,400
Hey, it seems to me that you think that

665
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:44,444
I've forgotten
about the Lee Sang-do case, but--

666
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,197
Let's put Lee Sang-do's wife
on the wanted list.

667
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,366
-Hey.
-Her children are young.

668
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,576
I'm sure she would like
to have them transferred.

669
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,620
I'll send an official letter
to the Office of Education

670
00:47:53,703 --> 00:47:55,247
and stop by their office
before coming to work tomorrow.

671
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:57,457
Look at you trying to get the head start.

672
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,210
The day after tomorrow is the due date.
Did you find the evidence?

673
00:48:00,293 --> 00:48:01,628
I know it's the day.

674
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,046
It's a week
before the physical fitness test.

675
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,882
This is why you should always be ready.

676
00:48:06,424 --> 00:48:07,467
Do you understand, Jangmi?

677
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,473
I will get going.

678
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:21,731
Is she a sociopath?

679
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:25,360
You will understand
once you become as old as us.

680
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:39,040
<i>Should I have done this?</i>

681
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,941
Try guessing what I just proved.

682
00:49:06,067 --> 00:49:07,152
The fact that I've dated before?

683
00:49:07,902 --> 00:49:08,778
Or...

684
00:49:09,487 --> 00:49:10,614
that I'm dating right now?

685
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:18,455
Why won't you answer?

686
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:20,999
Do you want me to tell you?

687
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,336
You should keep it to yourself.

688
00:49:25,378 --> 00:49:26,630
I'm dating right now.

689
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:30,717
Take off your clothes.

690
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:34,387
Is that your answer?

691
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:37,807
I didn't see this coming.

692
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:42,395
Do you have a strange scar
on your shoulder?

693
00:49:43,688 --> 00:49:44,981
Who told you that?

694
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:47,150
Did you make that weird scar
on his shoulder too?

695
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:50,987
Eun-sup in your world is asking
if I made the scar.

696
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:55,533
It's not necessarily false.

697
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,994
I got the scar
from when I went to see you.

698
00:49:58,244 --> 00:49:59,621
Not all of them.

699
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,498
Then tell me exactly how many.

700
00:50:02,415 --> 00:50:03,541
You got me too excited.

701
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:04,584
Two.

702
00:50:09,714 --> 00:50:11,758
That won't be enough to see my shoulders.

703
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:13,009
They are really broad.

704
00:50:15,553 --> 00:50:17,806
Forget it. You can't see it now anyway.

705
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,642
Why? Is it luminous?

706
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,727
If you're so curious, turn off the light.

707
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:23,770
I'm not curious.

708
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,731
I just didn't want to take the blame.

709
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,733
Go now. I'm sleepy.

710
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:33,613
It's more difficult to cross this line

711
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,079
than it is to cross universes.

712
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:44,999
Fine.

713
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:46,418
I will get going.

714
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:48,920
Make sure to sleep well.

715
00:51:01,182 --> 00:51:02,350
<i>Physiatrists and researchers</i>

716
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:06,438
<i>were dispatched to Sukhumvit in Thailand.</i>

717

<i>The head of the business,

718
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:10,650
<i>an efficient development of

719

00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:15,989
<i>Professor Lee Jong-in says--</i>

721
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,367
<i>Lee Jong-in, Prince Buyeong,</i>

722
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,786
second in line to the throne.

723
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:24,664
King Haejong's nephew

724
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:27,292
and Prince Inpyeong's eldest son.

725
00:51:29,502 --> 00:51:31,963
King Haejong's nephew...

726
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,048
<i>King Haejong, my grandfather...</i>

727
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:36,092
You use the term South and North Korea,

728
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,178
but in our world,
it's the southern and northern regions.

729
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,518
<i>The northern K Stadium created a big buzz
even before its construction.</i>

730
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,103
<i>The northern K Stadium...</i>

731
00:51:49,814 --> 00:51:51,191
<i>The northern...</i>

732
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,277
<i>The northern...</i>

733

<i>-King Haejong, my grandfather...
-The northern...</i>

734
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,019
NOTES

735
00:52:31,397 --> 00:52:33,149
All she really did
was search the internet.

736
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,902
She didn't leave anything behind.

737
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:38,780
Your Majesty,

738
00:52:39,405 --> 00:52:41,574
please allow me to visit you for a second.

739
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:48,957
After your visit,
I found this at the Royal Wardrobe.

740
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:52,168
But there are many things
that I don't know.

741
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:55,797
I wasn't sure if this is something
that you lost

742
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,757
or not.

743
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,050
Leave it here.

744
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:00,552
It's mine.

745
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,557
So she did leave something.

746
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:11,896
I'm thanking you.

747
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:13,815
Have a good night.

748
00:53:15,733 --> 00:53:16,985
I'm having a good night

749
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,821
thanks to you.

750
00:53:20,446 --> 00:53:21,406
Yes, Your Majesty.

751
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,096
There you are.

752
00:53:46,347 --> 00:53:48,766
I asked you to have dinner with me,
but you made me eat alone.

753
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:51,686
Rice with beans, spinach soup,
and spinach frittata.

754
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:53,605
You decided on the menu today, didn't you?

755
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,524
I have no appetite.

756
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,651
They say

757
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:02,822
there's a thief in the palace,
but I can't find that brat.

758
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,199
It's driving me crazy.

759
00:54:07,368 --> 00:54:10,997
Anyway, did you finish all the food?

760
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,874
You told me to think of it as medicine.

761
00:54:13,374 --> 00:54:16,210
When you're like this,
you're still a baby.

762
00:54:16,961 --> 00:54:19,339
I don't understand
how you even go to the battlefield.

763
00:54:22,967 --> 00:54:25,094
Will you tell me

764
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:28,514
what you said you would tell me now
or should I wait?

765
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,101
Did Uncle Buyeong

766
00:54:33,227 --> 00:54:34,145
call?

767
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:37,899
He came back from the conference.

768
00:54:37,982 --> 00:54:41,444
I called him and said
you came back to the palace safely.

769
00:54:41,527 --> 00:54:43,738
Then he said, "That's good"
and hung up the phone.

770
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:48,868
You taste all my food,

771
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,329
examine every cloth,

772
00:54:52,413 --> 00:54:55,041
every piece of furniture,
and every item that comes into the palace.

773
00:54:55,249 --> 00:54:58,002
And you suspect every person
that enters the palace to protect me.

774
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,253
You also

775
00:55:00,129 --> 00:55:01,381
hid the Manpasikjeok in the whip

776
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,091
and protected it.

777
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:05,843
May I ask why?

778
00:55:06,427 --> 00:55:07,261
Well...

779
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:11,182
It's just what I had to do, Your Majesty.

780
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:14,894
What the traitor, Lee Lim,

781
00:55:15,269 --> 00:55:18,231
tried to steal that night
was the Manpasikjeok.

782
00:55:18,731 --> 00:55:20,108
So I had to protect it.

783
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:23,152
I had to hide it from him.

784
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:30,118
When Lee Lim's dead body was found,

785
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:34,664
the first thing I did was
to look for the other half.

786
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:36,791
But I failed to find it.

787
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:41,713
I heard the corpse was drifting
in the sea for quite some time.

788
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:45,174
I told myself that it must have gone back
to the Dragon King of the East Sea

789
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:48,803
just like the myth.

790
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,514
And it relieved me.

791
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:52,932
I'm also

792
00:55:54,308 --> 00:55:55,935
relying on a myth.

793
00:55:57,186 --> 00:55:59,105
That's why I'm waiting for Uncle Buyeong.

794
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:03,484
I'm not telling you the stories in detail

795
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,946
not because I want to hide it
but because I don't know yet.

796
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,239
So I want you

797
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,199
to find the thief

798
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:12,952
while I am looking for something else.

799
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:15,413
Yes, Your Majesty.

800
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,124
I will find the thief.

801
00:56:23,337 --> 00:56:26,466
There's no match to the fingerprint?

802
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:28,092
<i>No. Nothing at all.</i>

803
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:31,304
<i>Does the fingerprint
belong to a foreigner?</i>

804
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:34,640
Then...

805
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:40,605
Did you catch the woman called Luna?

806
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:42,899
<i>Well, not yet.</i>

807
00:56:43,941 --> 00:56:46,194
<i>Why is the Royal Court
looking for Luna though?</i>

808
00:56:46,652 --> 00:56:48,905
It's confidential.
Please be understanding.

809
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,866
Did you get the CCTV footage
that I asked before?

810
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:53,951
Yes, I did. But...

811
00:56:54,827 --> 00:56:57,955
I'm not sure if I can say
I have the footage or not, though.

812
00:56:58,039 --> 00:56:59,874
They don't show anything interesting.

813
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:03,586
She seems to know
where exactly the CCTVs are.

814
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,713
<i>None of them show her front face.</i>

815
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:08,674
Okay. I will call you back.

816
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:11,969
Please hold on.

817
00:57:16,557 --> 00:57:17,809
Let me take a picture of you.

818
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,685
It's for the security.

819
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:26,859
What just happened?

820
00:57:27,443 --> 00:57:28,528
Tell me about it.

821
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,155
I'm sorry.

822
00:57:31,447 --> 00:57:32,782
Why are you sorry?

823
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:35,952
Isn't my lipstick color weird now?

824
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,247
I think he's trying
to take pictures of me. Unbelievable.

825
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,373
I don't think so.

826
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,626
You don't know. That's what it is.

827
00:57:43,709 --> 00:57:45,336
I think I know him better than you do.

828
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:46,963
I'm his uncle.

829
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:48,714
What?

830
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,228
Could you please zoom in Camera 21?

831
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:03,688
Okay.

832
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,869
Is the person you were chasing,
Luna, here?

833
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:18,786
Then tell me which.

834
00:58:23,207 --> 00:58:24,292
This is her.

835
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:26,836
This is Luna.

836
00:58:26,919 --> 00:58:29,130
Goodness. Look.

837
00:58:29,213 --> 00:58:32,008
Look how wealthy she looks now
after stealing others' money. Gosh.

838
00:58:32,466 --> 00:58:33,885
Where is she now?

839
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:36,512
Tell me when you find her, okay?

840
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,516
You and I aren't too different.
We both use force to do our jobs.

841
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,559
You are the Royal Guard!

842
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:43,227
And I'm a gangster!

843
00:58:44,353 --> 00:58:46,147
Are you out of your mind?

844
00:58:48,065 --> 00:58:50,651
My world has just collapsed, you prick.

845
00:59:15,259 --> 00:59:17,178
Yeong, is everything all right?

846
00:59:18,554 --> 00:59:20,139
You came to work late today.

847
00:59:20,973 --> 00:59:21,974
Everything is all right.

848
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,479
Should I come back later, Your Majesty?

849
00:59:26,562 --> 00:59:27,855
That might be better.

850
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:33,819
Gosh.

851
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:36,155
My neck hurts.

852
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:38,824
I know something is up.

853
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,202
What is it?

854
00:59:46,582 --> 00:59:48,042
What is this?

855
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:49,835
What strangled your wrist?

856
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:52,964
Is it the same kind of wound
as the one on your shoulder?

857
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:54,215
No.

858
00:59:54,423 --> 00:59:55,800
This is not that.

859
00:59:56,592 --> 00:59:58,094
This mark shows that

860
00:59:58,844 --> 01:00:00,846
there's someone
who comes in and out of my heart.

861
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,724
It's kind of tight though.

862
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:05,768
As if my heart is going to burst.

863
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:13,943
Your Majesty, Prince Buyeong
has just entered the palace.

864
01:00:15,861 --> 01:00:16,946
Where is he now?

865
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:21,033
How was the conference?

866
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:23,411
It was a mess.

867
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,955
I couldn't focus on the presentation

868
01:00:26,747 --> 01:00:29,208
because you were on the battlefield.

869
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:33,379
Please stay healthy.

870
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,258
You know you are the only one I have.

871
01:00:37,883 --> 01:00:38,759
That's why

872
01:00:39,343 --> 01:00:42,680
it's a very precious and sad life.

873
01:00:43,347 --> 01:00:44,307
For me

874
01:00:44,765 --> 01:00:45,766
and you.

875
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:49,353
That is why

876
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:53,232
I wished you would never ask me
about that incident.

877
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:55,401
But at the same time,

878
01:00:55,901 --> 01:00:59,864
I knew you would ask me about it someday.

879
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:04,410
About the traitor Lee Lim's
real cause of death.

880
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:12,543
This is the death certificate

881
01:01:12,626 --> 01:01:14,628
where the real cause
of Prince Imperial Geum's death

882
01:01:15,379 --> 01:01:16,589
is written.

883
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,518
Lee Lim was killed

884
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:35,066
not by the Royal Guards
but by the fracture of the cervical spine.

885
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:38,277
He got his neck broken
and then was thrown into the ocean.

886
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:40,404
How strange is that?

887
01:01:42,531 --> 01:01:43,574
What's even stranger was

888
01:01:44,533 --> 01:01:48,788
that Lee Lim was a man
with the body of a big warrior.

889
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:51,624
But the corpse we found

890
01:01:52,666 --> 01:01:57,463
showed signs that it was born
with poliomyelitis.

891
01:01:57,546 --> 01:01:59,382
Not to mention its appearance,

892
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:06,097
its fingerprints and even blood type
matched with Lee Lim.

893
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:08,516
That odd corpse confused me,

894
01:02:09,975 --> 01:02:11,644
and that is why I hid it from you.

895
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:18,734
You have been hiding it
for quite a long time.

896
01:02:20,569 --> 01:02:22,071
It's not a minor crime

897
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:24,365
to lie about the death

898
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:26,325
of a traitor of the nation

899
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:31,288
and a high-profile criminal.

900
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,917
I know that, Your Majesty.

901
01:02:35,876 --> 01:02:36,752
That's why

902
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:40,881
I have been feeling guilty my entire life.

903
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:44,802
I would like to free myself
from that guilt now.

904
01:02:46,303 --> 01:02:50,433
If you ever find out the truth
behind that odd incident,

905
01:02:51,016 --> 01:02:53,561
will you please tell me?

906
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:57,982
What truth could lay behind that body?

907
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:00,818
I have been curious about it
my whole life.

908
01:03:02,194 --> 01:03:03,487
Although I do not deserve it,

909
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:05,990
I would like to know as a doctor.

910
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:25,718
Yes! Popsicles!

911
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:27,344
-Thank you.
-Eat it.

912
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:28,429
Yes, sir.

913
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:30,890
Yes! This one's my favorite.

914
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:33,517
Leave it there. It's for someone else.

915
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:34,935
Okay.

916
01:03:39,523 --> 01:03:40,858
There are popsicles in the fridge.

917
01:03:40,941 --> 01:03:42,026
Yes! Popsicles.

918
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:45,362
This one's my favorite.

919
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:46,864
But that's...

920
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,451
Jangmi, briefing.

921
01:03:50,534 --> 01:03:51,577
Right.

922
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:54,788
I went to the Office of Education

923
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:57,541
and I found that Lee Sang-do's wife
didn't have her children transferred.

924
01:03:58,375 --> 01:04:00,878
I checked if she changed the address
on her registration, but she didn't.

925
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:02,630
She's still registered in Seoul.

926
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:06,842
She will eventually have to
have them transferred.

927
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:08,052
She's a mother after all.

928
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,971
-Keep your eye on it.
-Yes, ma'am.

929
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:16,602
Give me the big one.

930
01:04:16,685 --> 01:04:17,811
Goodness.

931
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:23,484
You know, other senior officers are happy
to see their juniors eat.

932
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:26,487
I'm not like that.

933
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:37,373
Did you find something
regarding the Lee Sang-do case?

934
01:04:42,002 --> 01:04:42,878
Sin-jae,

935
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:45,130
do you trust me?

936
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,175
I do. What is it?

937
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:54,223
Now you say you trust me,
it's even harder to tell you.

938
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,226
I will tell you when things are clearer.

939
01:04:57,393 --> 01:05:00,521
There's something,
but it's more of science fiction.

940
01:05:00,604 --> 01:05:02,231
I will tell you when it becomes science.

941
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:21,792
Here's your milk tea.

942
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:25,087
Thank you.

943
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:28,048
You seem new.
Do you live in this neighborhood?

944
01:05:28,882 --> 01:05:31,635
It's my first time here, but I think
I will visit this place more often.

945
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:34,555
I love this neighborhood.

946
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:37,016
It's lovely, right? Please come again.

947
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:39,727
It's quite rainy.

948
01:05:42,896 --> 01:05:44,273
It seems that a typhoon is coming.

949
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:48,652
<i>Be careful.</i>

950
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:51,947
<i>There are many typhoons in summer,</i>

951
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:54,283
<i>but typhoons in winter</i>

952
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:57,286
<i>cause the most damage.</i>

953
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:23,437
What's wrong?

954
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:24,855
You should be careful.

955
01:06:27,399 --> 01:06:28,817
I told you not to run!

956
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:31,862
Goodness,
I left the laundry outside to dry.

957
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,784
Seriously.

958
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:40,287
What's up, Kka-bi?

959
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:42,581
Did you not see the man's face?

960
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,541
It was so strange.

961
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:46,251
It was really scary.

962
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:49,004
What about his face?

963
01:06:49,421 --> 01:06:50,714
Was he very ugly?

964
01:06:50,839 --> 01:06:55,052
How could you not see it?
I'm the only one scared here.

965
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:57,846
He was like a monster.

966
01:06:58,055 --> 01:07:02,810
Kka-bi, you shouldn't be like that
with others' faces. It's not right.

967
01:07:02,893 --> 01:07:04,895
You never know
what will happen to your face later.

968
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:06,939
How could you say that to a little boy?

969
01:07:07,022 --> 01:07:07,898
What?

970
01:07:08,148 --> 01:07:09,942
Stop crying. I'm here for you.

971
01:07:10,734 --> 01:07:11,694
I have got your back.

972
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:13,612
Good. I'm glad we have you. Let's go now.

973
01:07:13,904 --> 01:07:15,364
It's pouring. Let's go inside.

974
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:18,617
What could have been
so weird about his face?

975
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:20,953
Let's go. Hey, wait up!
