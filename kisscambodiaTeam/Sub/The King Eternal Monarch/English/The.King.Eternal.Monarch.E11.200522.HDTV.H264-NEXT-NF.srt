PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:10,623 --> 00:00:12,500
EPISODE 11

5
00:01:24,947 --> 00:01:25,823
Who are you people?

6
00:01:27,575 --> 00:01:29,201
You're not cops.

7
00:01:30,327 --> 00:01:31,704
You seem like bad guys.

8
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:34,373
What kind of work do you do?

9
00:01:34,957 --> 00:01:36,917
We helped you escape from the cops.

10
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:44,467
So I guess I can say that we're allies.

11
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,432
I heard you're famous in the slums.

12
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:54,769
You can and will do anything for money.

13
00:01:55,644 --> 00:01:57,438
You don't have a home or a family.

14
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,648
You sleep curled up in a car seat

15
00:01:59,732 --> 00:02:01,817
and run errands for others
to make a living.

16
00:02:02,818 --> 00:02:04,111
You've been living in the gutter

17
00:02:04,653 --> 00:02:06,530
not knowing what your parents look like.

18
00:02:08,532 --> 00:02:10,201
And you'll die soon?

19
00:02:12,328 --> 00:02:14,371
Don't you think life is too cruel?

20
00:02:15,915 --> 00:02:17,374
Will it ever be your turn

21
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:19,418
to receive the organ transplant?

22
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,755
You just

23
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:27,468
hurt my feelings.

24
00:02:29,345 --> 00:02:32,473
I may use people's weaknesses,
but I never poke others' wounds.

25
00:02:33,724 --> 00:02:34,767
You're a douchebag.

26
00:02:36,936 --> 00:02:38,395
I refuse to be your ally.

27
00:02:42,525 --> 00:02:43,818
I always meet the right people.

28
00:02:48,656 --> 00:02:49,532
Have you been praying?

29
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:00,918
JEONG TAE-EUL

30
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,670
What is this?

31
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:09,009
You went to the trouble of photoshopping
my face onto this to bullshit me?

32
00:03:09,093 --> 00:03:10,010
This girl is you.

33
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,389
You in the other world, to be exact.

34
00:03:14,265 --> 00:03:16,725
However,
her life is very different from yours.

35
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,815
She grew up healthy and happy
with loving parents.

36
00:03:34,493 --> 00:03:36,078
These are your parents.

37
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:38,289
Though you've never seen them before.

38
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,965
<i>You're not that bitch I saw
in front of KU.</i>

39
00:03:49,341 --> 00:03:50,593
Do you have a twin sister?

40
00:03:52,261 --> 00:03:54,638
I'll give you a new life.

41
00:03:56,015 --> 00:03:57,600
Just nod if you want

42
00:03:58,267 --> 00:03:59,727
that life.

43
00:04:01,437 --> 00:04:02,563
Fortune has arrived

44
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:04,899
knocking at your door.

45
00:04:11,655 --> 00:04:12,573
How nice.

46
00:04:16,869 --> 00:04:18,495
She had everything.

47
00:04:20,164 --> 00:04:21,373
This pisses me off.

48
00:04:26,712 --> 00:04:28,422
I'm actually hurt.

49
00:04:36,138 --> 00:04:38,390
<i>Prince Buyeong, who is also known
as Professor Lee Jong-in,</i>

50
00:04:38,474 --> 00:04:40,935
<i>was found dead
in his residence last night.</i>

51
00:04:41,518 --> 00:04:44,813
<i>The Royal Court hasn't made a statement
regarding the exact cause of death.</i>

52
00:04:45,272 --> 00:04:49,818
<i>The police and prosecution
have stated that King Lee Gon</i>

53
00:04:49,944 --> 00:04:51,779
<i>has full authority over all matters</i>

54
00:04:51,862 --> 00:04:54,949
<i>regarding the case and that he will
investigate the cause of death himself.</i>

55
00:05:08,253 --> 00:05:14,343
<i>I return to Amitabha</i>

56
00:05:14,426 --> 00:05:19,598
<i>Who guides me to the pure land</i>

57
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:27,314
<i>I return to the two bodhisattvas</i>

58
00:05:27,398 --> 00:05:32,945
<i>On his left and right</i>

59
00:05:34,071 --> 00:05:39,368
<i>I return</i>

60
00:05:56,927 --> 00:05:59,430
Happy New Year, Your Majesty.

61
00:06:04,393 --> 00:06:06,603
<i>We are gathered here to wish the deceased</i>

62
00:06:06,687 --> 00:06:09,023
<i>A good rebirth</i>

63
00:06:09,606 --> 00:06:11,984
<i>And the earliest opportunity</i>

64
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:14,737
<i>To attain Nirvana</i>

65
00:06:15,237 --> 00:06:18,157
<i>Led by King Lee Gon</i>

66
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,285
<i>Of the Kingdom of Corea</i>

67
00:06:21,493 --> 00:06:23,245
<i>This funeral for Prince Buyeong</i>

68
00:06:23,328 --> 00:06:25,205
<i>A royal relative</i>

69
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:26,373
Prime Minister Koo.

70
00:06:26,457 --> 00:06:28,000
<i>Is for honoring all of his contributions</i>

71
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,044
-<i>And service to the nation</i>
-You smiled just now.

72
00:06:30,127 --> 00:06:34,757
-I did?
-<i>May Prince Buyeong's soul</i>

73
00:06:34,923 --> 00:06:40,679
<i>Rest in peace and attain Nirvana</i>

74
00:06:45,642 --> 00:06:47,811
I quite enjoy seeing Lee Gon

75
00:06:48,937 --> 00:06:50,022
in despair.

76
00:07:12,836 --> 00:07:16,548
Prime Minister Koo,
KU Group's chief secretary stopped by.

77
00:07:16,632 --> 00:07:17,633
Two hours ago.

78
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:20,719
I was told to make sure
you get this today.

79
00:07:20,803 --> 00:07:21,762
Just leave it there.

80
00:07:22,346 --> 00:07:24,139
I'm taking a quick break,
so don't disturb me.

81
00:07:24,765 --> 00:07:25,641
Yes, ma'am.

82
00:07:41,532 --> 00:07:43,408
<i>Aren't my secretaries so capable?</i>

83
00:08:07,224 --> 00:08:11,019
The customer who left the umbrella at
the store came to get it a few days ago.

84
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:15,149
He looked just like Lee Lim
when he was alive.

85
00:08:15,274 --> 00:08:16,191
So I thought

86
00:08:16,942 --> 00:08:19,153
maybe he had a son.

87
00:08:22,531 --> 00:08:23,866
So, Mom was right?

88
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,747
US PRESIDENT TRUMP VISITS NORTH KOREA

89
00:08:34,376 --> 00:08:36,920
US PRESIDENT TRUMP VISITS NORTH KOREA

90
00:08:37,087 --> 00:08:38,213
What is the connection

91
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,757
between these two?

92
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,765
I sent the 2G phone to myself
via registered mail before I came here.

93
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:51,602
If the recipient can't be reached,

94
00:08:51,977 --> 00:08:54,938
they'll keep it at the post office
after about two delivery attempts.

95
00:08:56,148 --> 00:08:57,566
They're probably still trying.

96
00:09:01,403 --> 00:09:02,779
Are you going to get me out now?

97
00:09:03,906 --> 00:09:06,033
<i>Of course, I'll get you out.</i>

98
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,470
<i>Corpses are removed immediately, you know.</i>

99
00:09:43,904 --> 00:09:45,781
Are you looking for something specific?

100
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:50,410
If your skin is on the dry side,

101
00:09:51,203 --> 00:09:52,955
would you like to try this?

102
00:09:53,956 --> 00:09:54,957
Now?

103
00:09:55,999 --> 00:09:57,668
It's very dry outside, isn't it?

104
00:09:57,751 --> 00:10:01,171
This is Golden Time Mist Ampoule.
Please close your eyes.

105
00:10:01,755 --> 00:10:02,714
I'll try it myself.

106
00:10:04,925 --> 00:10:07,928
Spray it right after washing your face,
and it'll keep your skin hydrated--

107
00:10:10,347 --> 00:10:12,182
Hey, Jangmi. She just got out.
On the left.

108
00:10:12,266 --> 00:10:13,517
Her outfit matches yours.

109
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,185
Okay, got it.

110
00:10:24,611 --> 00:10:26,613
Move along. No photos, please!

111
00:10:40,377 --> 00:10:42,587
Did you guys just abduct her?

112
00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:44,965
No, we arrested her.

113
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:47,301
Oh, right.

114
00:10:48,427 --> 00:10:49,303
We're police officers.

115
00:10:50,721 --> 00:10:51,555
I'm sorry.

116
00:10:51,638 --> 00:10:52,848
Thanks for your cooperation.

117
00:10:56,268 --> 00:10:57,477
And for this too.

118
00:10:57,728 --> 00:10:59,062
It is very hydrating indeed.

119
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:37,017
The Royal Wardrobe sent your clothes
for the New Year's ceremony.

120
00:11:38,018 --> 00:11:41,146
I thought I should drop it off myself
so that I could see you.

121
00:11:41,229 --> 00:11:43,732
Oh, is today that day?

122
00:11:44,274 --> 00:11:45,192
The one day of the year

123
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:48,236
when Prime Minister Koo
stays up all night with His Majesty?

124
00:11:49,071 --> 00:11:51,782
You obviously came here
because it makes you uneasy.

125
00:11:53,575 --> 00:11:55,494
Because of that wench, Koo Seo-ryeong?

126
00:11:56,036 --> 00:11:57,412
Gosh, of course not.

127
00:11:59,122 --> 00:12:00,248
I'm glad you're here.

128
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,377
I knew it was around this time
of the year, so I was waiting for you.

129
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:07,756
The <i>gamhongro</i> has aged very well.

130
00:12:15,722 --> 00:12:18,392
Has His Majesty left the study?

131
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:22,396
Yes, just in time on Thursday night.

132
00:12:25,107 --> 00:12:27,150
Prime Minister Koo is pretty,
but that's about it.

133
00:12:27,234 --> 00:12:30,153
She has no other good qualities.

134
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,822
She is sly and vulpine.

135
00:12:33,031 --> 00:12:36,368
And if you look at her closely,
she's not even that pretty.

136
00:12:38,453 --> 00:12:39,413
I know.

137
00:12:39,996 --> 00:12:41,581
I understand.

138
00:13:10,944 --> 00:13:12,654
She doesn't have any health problems.

139
00:13:14,114 --> 00:13:16,908
We gave her a tranquilizer
along with vitamin infusions.

140
00:13:20,287 --> 00:13:21,621
And Dr. Hwang said

141
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:25,292
he'll return to the palace as soon as
Prince Buyeong's autopsy is done.

142
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,604
I love you.

143
00:15:13,358 --> 00:15:16,903
A lot.

144
00:15:21,283 --> 00:15:22,409
I am in love with you.

145
00:15:59,821 --> 00:16:01,031
<i>I could tell</i>

146
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:04,743
<i>that he was from a different time,</i>

147
00:16:06,244 --> 00:16:08,330
<i>not a different world.</i>

148
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:12,500
<i>Perhaps,</i>

149
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:16,004
<i>that was the day when I made up my mind</i>

150
00:16:18,256 --> 00:16:19,633
<i>about a lot of things.</i>

151
00:16:35,065 --> 00:16:36,524
Am I getting dumped like this?

152
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:42,656
No way. I'll teach you a lesson
when you come back.

153
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:12,852
FORENSICS TEAM, GYEONG-RAN

154
00:17:14,604 --> 00:17:15,647
Hey, it's me.

155
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,649
<i>Did you hear?</i>

156
00:17:18,608 --> 00:17:21,319
<i>Jang Yeon-ji committed suicide at
the penitentiary.</i>

157
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,737
Suicide?

158
00:17:22,987 --> 00:17:23,822
<i>Yes.</i>

159
00:17:24,155 --> 00:17:26,616
<i>I just got a call
from Seongdong-gu's forensics team.</i>

160
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:28,243
Hold on.

161
00:17:28,952 --> 00:17:30,870
Jang Yeon-ji took her own life.

162
00:17:33,123 --> 00:17:34,249
Hey, go on.

163
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:38,002
<i>But they happened to have a power outage
that day, so there's no CCTV footage.</i>

164
00:17:39,379 --> 00:17:42,590
You didn't harass or mistreat her
when you were there, right?

165
00:17:43,466 --> 00:17:44,634
I heard you visited her.

166
00:17:45,635 --> 00:17:49,139
Suicides are rare at penitentiaries,
you know.

167
00:17:50,598 --> 00:17:53,893
They might investigate you
for use of force, so be careful.

168
00:17:53,977 --> 00:17:55,395
Okay. Thanks, Gyeong-ran.

169
00:17:55,729 --> 00:17:56,730
I have to go.

170
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:03,278
They got rid of her to cut the tail off.

171
00:18:04,028 --> 00:18:05,071
Let's go.

172
00:18:05,697 --> 00:18:06,614
Go where?

173
00:18:07,073 --> 00:18:08,616
It's not even within our jurisdiction.

174
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,576
Not there.

175
00:18:10,285 --> 00:18:11,578
Let's find Song Jeong-hye first.

176
00:18:12,162 --> 00:18:14,748
The cinerarium may have
her contact details as the guardian.

177
00:18:16,499 --> 00:18:17,417
Who is Song Jeong-hye?

178
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,836
Lee Ji-hun's mother.

179
00:18:20,628 --> 00:18:22,672
The cinerarium you went to.
That boy is Lee Ji-hun.

180
00:18:23,548 --> 00:18:25,467
But if she's Lee Ji-hun's mom...

181
00:18:26,176 --> 00:18:27,051
That's right.

182
00:18:27,135 --> 00:18:28,803
She looks exactly like Lee Gon's mother,

183
00:18:29,387 --> 00:18:32,390
which means
she's most likely with Lee Lim now.

184
00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:35,685
The address is useless.
I went there and saw nothing but farmland.

185
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:37,604
Just a moment.

186
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:39,773
It's the management office.

187
00:18:40,148 --> 00:18:41,149
Hello?

188
00:18:43,318 --> 00:18:44,444
Are you the one who called?

189
00:18:44,861 --> 00:18:45,945
Yes, I am.

190
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:48,114
I'm Lieutenant Jeong
from Jongno Police Station.

191
00:18:48,323 --> 00:18:49,157
I see.

192
00:18:49,532 --> 00:18:51,159
I looked into what you had asked me about,

193
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:54,120
but we have no one's contact information
on file for Lee Ji-hun.

194
00:18:54,287 --> 00:18:57,749
We've been receiving
five years' worth of payments up front.

195
00:18:57,832 --> 00:18:59,751
Always in cash.

196
00:19:02,003 --> 00:19:03,296
I never thought of that.

197
00:19:04,881 --> 00:19:07,300
Then could we get access
to your security camera footage?

198
00:19:07,383 --> 00:19:10,094
Not the whole cinerarium.
Just the ones from your parking lot.

199
00:19:10,178 --> 00:19:12,180
-We'll be there shortly.
-Okay, I'll see you there.

200
00:19:15,391 --> 00:19:16,810
We need the footage from here.

201
00:19:17,894 --> 00:19:19,229
We don't know what she looks like.

202
00:19:20,814 --> 00:19:21,940
I do.

203
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:40,416
By the way, who is Lee Lim?

204
00:19:44,462 --> 00:19:45,797
The instigator behind all of this.

205
00:19:47,173 --> 00:19:48,341
And I think

206
00:19:50,969 --> 00:19:54,013
he's the one who brought you here.

207
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,251
This was in the pocket.

208
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,463
I didn't come for that. You can keep it.

209
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:31,175
Use it to protect what belongs to you.

210
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,640
You know where my car is, right?

211
00:20:38,224 --> 00:20:41,060
You can have that too.
And everything inside the car.

212
00:20:42,228 --> 00:20:43,271
All I ask for in return

213
00:20:44,272 --> 00:20:45,857
is that you feed Luna.

214
00:20:46,858 --> 00:20:48,234
Are you stealing something again?

215
00:20:52,947 --> 00:20:53,781
Do you believe

216
00:20:56,451 --> 00:20:57,660
God exists?

217
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:02,248
Then I'll be punished.

218
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,006
By the way, that yo-yo...

219
00:21:11,215 --> 00:21:12,342
Why is the string red?

220
00:21:15,762 --> 00:21:16,804
I hooked it up myself.

221
00:21:18,765 --> 00:21:20,350
Who taught you that expression?

222
00:21:22,518 --> 00:21:24,354
Hook it up again.
It looks like it might break.

223
00:21:24,812 --> 00:21:25,688
Bye.

224
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,649
All right, bye.

225
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:39,869
He practically disowned his son

226
00:21:40,495 --> 00:21:43,081
and devoted his life to the Royal Court.

227
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,459
A member of the royal family wore this?

228
00:21:49,462 --> 00:21:51,339
And look at these furniture pieces.
Goodness.

229
00:21:53,216 --> 00:21:54,467
Did you read the article today?

230
00:21:56,052 --> 00:21:57,637
"Passed away at 76,

231
00:21:58,304 --> 00:22:02,517
a righteous, humble life
devoted to the nation and Royal Court."

232
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:06,521
"Righteous"? Sure.

233
00:22:07,605 --> 00:22:09,816
But why did the word, "humble,"
have to go in there?

234
00:22:11,234 --> 00:22:13,945
You folks worked him like a dog
until he was almost 80.

235
00:22:14,612 --> 00:22:15,446
"Humble"?

236
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:18,199
He was just used.

237
00:22:19,367 --> 00:22:21,202
My father was used.

238
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,581
<i>It's New Year's Day. We'll visit you.</i>

239
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,667
<i>Se-jin misses you a lot.</i>

240
00:22:28,418 --> 00:22:30,545
Just send Se-jin, then.
You cannot come here.

241
00:22:31,087 --> 00:22:33,965
You cannot set foot
in the Kingdom of Corea.

242
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:36,092
<i>Dad, why are you being like this?</i>

243
00:22:36,718 --> 00:22:38,177
<i>We follow the rule of primogeniture,</i>

244
00:22:38,344 --> 00:22:40,304
<i>so I'll be next in line when you're gone.</i>

245
00:22:40,888 --> 00:22:41,931
<i>Will you seriously let</i>

246
00:22:42,306 --> 00:22:44,350
<i>all that money fall into Gon's lap?</i>

247
00:22:44,517 --> 00:22:45,643
Let me say this again.

248
00:22:46,227 --> 00:22:47,520
I absolutely cannot let you

249
00:22:47,603 --> 00:22:50,648
come anywhere near the Royal Court,
no matter what.

250
00:22:50,732 --> 00:22:51,607
I have to go.

251
00:22:54,944 --> 00:22:56,696
I can move into this house, right?

252
00:22:57,739 --> 00:22:59,240
I'm selling my house in Los Angeles.

253
00:23:00,366 --> 00:23:03,286
I'll also close my clinic
as soon as the date for my return is set.

254
00:23:04,454 --> 00:23:06,456
I should take over
the royal physician role

255
00:23:07,123 --> 00:23:09,459
and manage the foundation as well.

256
00:23:13,004 --> 00:23:14,922
You should make me the new director

257
00:23:15,214 --> 00:23:17,258
on the day you announce
the order of succession.

258
00:23:20,762 --> 00:23:21,721
Seung-heon.

259
00:23:23,181 --> 00:23:24,265
Yes, Your Majesty.

260
00:23:27,894 --> 00:23:30,354
You cannot enter the Kingdom of Corea.

261
00:23:33,524 --> 00:23:35,026
-Your Majesty.
-And you will not

262
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:36,194
succeed the throne after me.

263
00:23:37,445 --> 00:23:40,239
Se-jin is next in line to the throne.

264
00:23:40,323 --> 00:23:41,574
Nonsense.

265
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:43,451
Says who?

266
00:23:43,534 --> 00:23:46,704
You must leave the country immediately
after the 49th-day memorial service.

267
00:23:47,705 --> 00:23:51,084
I will let you maintain your dignity
as a member of the Royal Family.

268
00:23:51,584 --> 00:23:52,418
Gon, how dare you...

269
00:23:54,212 --> 00:23:55,713
-Hey--
-Is anybody outside?

270
00:24:00,885 --> 00:24:02,345
I want a full report on every move

271
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:05,973
of Prince Buyeong's eldest son
until the 49th-day memorial service.

272
00:24:07,058 --> 00:24:09,018
And he shall leave the country

273
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,814
as soon as the memorial service is over.

274
00:24:13,064 --> 00:24:14,315
-Yes, Your Majesty!
-Yes, Your Majesty!

275
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,362
Wait, Your Majesty.

276
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:20,488
Your Majesty!

277
00:24:20,571 --> 00:24:22,406
Hey, step aside! Move!

278
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,700
Your Majesty, please spare me a second.
Your Majesty!

279
00:24:42,051 --> 00:24:42,885
Your Majesty.

280
00:24:47,557 --> 00:24:48,432
I suppose the autopsy

281
00:24:50,893 --> 00:24:51,894
is complete.

282
00:25:02,405 --> 00:25:03,364
I'm ready to listen.

283
00:25:07,326 --> 00:25:10,246
The cause of death was asphyxiation
caused by manual strangulation.

284
00:25:11,372 --> 00:25:12,874
A strong force was applied to the neck.

285
00:25:19,046 --> 00:25:21,132
This was found on the corpse.

286
00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:25,219
It seems like someone
put it on his finger after he died.

287
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,390
Also, no hesitation wounds were found
on the Royal Guards who were killed.

288
00:25:29,473 --> 00:25:31,726
They were slain in one blow
with a sharp blade.

289
00:25:43,362 --> 00:25:44,197
<i>Lee Lim</i>

290
00:25:44,864 --> 00:25:45,948
<i>will not hide,</i>

291
00:25:46,532 --> 00:25:48,367
<i>and he does not intend to hide anything.</i>

292
00:25:48,868 --> 00:25:49,702
<i>He is</i>

293
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:53,789
<i>calling me to stand on my father's blood.</i>

294
00:25:54,832 --> 00:25:57,001
<i>He is provoking me using my uncle's blood.</i>

295
00:25:58,461 --> 00:25:59,420
<i>Lee Lim.</i>

296
00:26:35,456 --> 00:26:36,374
My gosh!

297
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,416
Your Majesty.

298
00:26:38,084 --> 00:26:39,252
When did His Majesty get here?

299
00:26:40,044 --> 00:26:41,420
No idea. He startled me.

300
00:26:41,504 --> 00:26:42,964
Your Majesty, in the garden...

301
00:26:44,215 --> 00:26:46,133
My apologies.
I was distracted for a moment.

302
00:26:46,467 --> 00:26:47,301
Sub-captain Seok.

303
00:26:48,302 --> 00:26:49,345
I'll be away.

304
00:26:50,388 --> 00:26:53,099
I'll try to come back soon,
but it may take a while.

305
00:26:53,766 --> 00:26:54,976
You won't be able to reach me.

306
00:26:55,184 --> 00:26:56,978
-Officially, I'm in the study--
-Your Majesty.

307
00:27:00,106 --> 00:27:01,607
You need to see this.

308
00:27:04,235 --> 00:27:07,280
This news has been circulating
since this afternoon.

309
00:27:08,572 --> 00:27:10,533
All media outlets
have released stories about this.

310
00:27:10,866 --> 00:27:12,827
This is intentional, Your Majesty.

311
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:14,996
Prime Minister Koo

312
00:27:16,872 --> 00:27:18,165
has pulled the trigger.

313
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,334
She wants to tie me down.

314
00:27:22,044 --> 00:27:24,255
-Call her office now.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

315
00:27:29,093 --> 00:27:31,345
This is the Royal Court.
His Majesty is asking for her.

316
00:27:33,889 --> 00:27:34,932
A sick day?

317
00:27:35,725 --> 00:27:37,018
Prime Minister Koo?

318
00:27:38,102 --> 00:27:39,061
Anyway, okay.

319
00:27:40,354 --> 00:27:41,814
-Your Majesty.
-I heard.

320
00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:45,526
Find her and put her on the phone.

321
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:46,485
Yes, Your Majesty.

322
00:27:51,907 --> 00:27:52,783
Sub-captain Seok.

323
00:27:53,951 --> 00:27:56,871
Bring me the daily log of the team
that guarded Prince Buyeong.

324
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,040
For the past six months.

325
00:27:59,749 --> 00:28:00,750
Yes, Your Majesty!

326
00:28:05,921 --> 00:28:09,050
<i>The ones for the evening contain
a sleep inducer, so take them on time.</i>

327
00:28:25,524 --> 00:28:26,692
Who are you?

328
00:28:26,942 --> 00:28:28,069
Why are you tailing me?

329
00:28:29,362 --> 00:28:30,946
I bet this isn't the first time.

330
00:28:33,282 --> 00:28:34,241
All right. Pick it up.

331
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:36,452
That will be best for both of us.

332
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:44,627
All right, well done.

333
00:28:47,629 --> 00:28:48,547
Nice catch.

334
00:28:49,048 --> 00:28:50,549
Now, listen up.

335
00:28:51,258 --> 00:28:53,386
That broken bottle makes this
special violence.

336
00:28:53,761 --> 00:28:56,180
And you're holding my wallet,
so this is also robbery.

337
00:28:56,847 --> 00:28:58,641
See this blood?
Infliction of bodily injury.

338
00:28:59,183 --> 00:29:02,978
So, everything I do from this moment on
will be considered execution of duties.

339
00:29:15,658 --> 00:29:16,492
God damn it.

340
00:29:30,131 --> 00:29:31,048
Oh, right.

341
00:29:31,715 --> 00:29:33,426
I'm not supposed to kill you.

342
00:29:42,685 --> 00:29:44,019
Who told you not to kill me?

343
00:29:45,354 --> 00:29:46,897
Who? I should thank that person.

344
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,608
Just someone

345
00:29:51,902 --> 00:29:53,070
who's always by your side.

346
00:29:55,281 --> 00:29:56,240
Who are you, really?

347
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,493
If you let me go now,

348
00:30:01,036 --> 00:30:02,163
this phone will ring.

349
00:30:03,164 --> 00:30:04,081
But if you arrest me,

350
00:30:05,749 --> 00:30:07,001
this phone won't ring.

351
00:30:08,085 --> 00:30:09,170
Forever.

352
00:30:13,841 --> 00:30:15,050
I'm just curious.

353
00:30:17,052 --> 00:30:18,220
Who pays the phone bill?

354
00:30:23,392 --> 00:30:24,768
You can't catch me anyway.

355
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,449
031G 7370

356
00:30:39,158 --> 00:30:40,701
031G 7370

357
00:30:53,246 --> 00:30:58,418
Now, describe the process of the arrest.
Write down when and how it was done.

358
00:30:59,127 --> 00:31:00,170
Okay.

359
00:31:01,129 --> 00:31:04,508
On January 30, we staked out
a skincare store near Jongno Station.

360
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:07,427
Lieutenant Jeong sprayed facial mist
with her eyes open.

361
00:31:08,094 --> 00:31:09,095
Jangmi.

362
00:31:11,056 --> 00:31:12,140
ON JANUARY 30, WE STAKED OUT

363
00:31:13,683 --> 00:31:16,102
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul
bravely sprayed facial mist--

364
00:31:16,186 --> 00:31:17,020
Jangmi?

365
00:31:19,773 --> 00:31:21,316
Sin-jae! What happened?

366
00:31:21,691 --> 00:31:22,692
Sin-jae!

367
00:31:23,068 --> 00:31:23,902
Gosh!

368
00:31:24,903 --> 00:31:26,863
Come and sit here.

369
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:30,116
What happened?

370
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:31,660
What kind of bastard...

371
00:31:31,743 --> 00:31:32,702
Tell me.

372
00:31:32,911 --> 00:31:34,829
I will destroy that bastard.

373
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:37,666
I'll bring the car over.
Dress the wound and meet me outside.

374
00:31:37,791 --> 00:31:38,625
Okay.

375
00:31:39,668 --> 00:31:42,212
You should've gone straight
to the hospital. Why come here?

376
00:31:42,295 --> 00:31:43,630
Don't make me talk. This hurts.

377
00:31:45,131 --> 00:31:46,007
Take this.

378
00:31:48,635 --> 00:31:49,761
Dust it for prints.

379
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,597
You'll find mine too. Just disregard it.

380
00:31:55,058 --> 00:31:55,892
This is...

381
00:31:56,476 --> 00:31:58,019
Yes, what they all have in common.

382
00:31:59,563 --> 00:32:00,605
It came to me as well.

383
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,819
Aren't we going to the hospital?

384
00:32:05,944 --> 00:32:07,070
Let's go. This hurts a lot.

385
00:32:07,571 --> 00:32:08,697
Gosh, seriously.

386
00:32:09,656 --> 00:32:10,740
Jangmi, hurry.

387
00:32:10,991 --> 00:32:11,992
Yes! I'm on my way!

388
00:32:14,327 --> 00:32:15,370
I got the direction wrong.

389
00:32:15,495 --> 00:32:17,622
I should've dodged to the left
but went the other way.

390
00:32:18,372 --> 00:32:19,248
Okay.

391
00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:25,672
Don't call my mom.

392
00:32:27,215 --> 00:32:28,300
And don't tell Chief Park.

393
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,343
That guy, Jo Yeong, too.

394
00:32:30,427 --> 00:32:31,761
Just don't tell anyone.

395
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:35,307
Come on. Jangmi knows.

396
00:32:36,308 --> 00:32:37,309
Oh, right.

397
00:32:38,893 --> 00:32:40,395
You look more severely injured.

398
00:32:45,442 --> 00:32:46,401
What happened?

399
00:32:47,235 --> 00:32:49,613
What do you mean the phone came to you?

400
00:32:51,823 --> 00:32:52,824
It must be that bastard.

401
00:32:53,533 --> 00:32:55,493
The one who brought me here. Lee Lim.

402
00:32:57,329 --> 00:32:58,330
He sent someone to me.

403
00:33:00,206 --> 00:33:02,334
That man said the phone will ring.

404
00:33:03,793 --> 00:33:06,546
I wonder why they approached me.

405
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:09,090
Will I actually get a call?

406
00:33:11,426 --> 00:33:13,345
Suggest meeting up to discuss the details.

407
00:33:13,637 --> 00:33:15,847
And tell him to bring
his prettiest friend.

408
00:33:16,181 --> 00:33:17,557
Let's catch them all at once.

409
00:33:21,353 --> 00:33:22,896
What are we after?

410
00:33:23,688 --> 00:33:25,023
And where are we headed?

411
00:33:29,194 --> 00:33:31,279
I don't have the exact answer to that yet.

412
00:33:32,238 --> 00:33:33,823
So I'll just keep going.

413
00:33:34,824 --> 00:33:37,702
I was told that we'll arrive somewhere
if we keep going.

414
00:33:38,912 --> 00:33:40,622
If we walk far enough, that is.

415
00:33:42,123 --> 00:33:44,417
-Who said that?
-<i>Alice in Wonderland.</i>

416
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:48,254
I think you're bullshitting me,
but I didn't read that book.

417
00:33:49,964 --> 00:33:51,007
Gosh, this hurts.

419
00:34:17,117 --> 00:34:18,618
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

420
00:34:19,244 --> 00:34:21,204
I cannot get a hold of Prime Minister Koo.

421
00:34:21,913 --> 00:34:23,707
She hasn't left her private residence,

422
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:26,918
and she's having all reports
sent to her electronically.

423
00:34:29,003 --> 00:34:30,088
Should I send someone?

424
00:34:32,465 --> 00:34:33,758
No, there is no need.

425
00:34:35,468 --> 00:34:38,596
She's trying to get back at me
by doing exactly what I did.

426
00:34:45,937 --> 00:34:48,565
It seems like she's trying to
go somewhere with this,

427
00:34:49,649 --> 00:34:50,483
so we shall wait.

BUSAN, THE SLUMS, EOSU BOOKSTORE

430
00:35:18,803 --> 00:35:20,096
"The slums,

431
00:35:21,765 --> 00:35:22,849
Eosu Bookstore."

432
00:35:27,061 --> 00:35:28,813
It's the only place he visited in Busan.

433
00:35:34,319 --> 00:35:35,612
What could this mean?

434
00:35:37,489 --> 00:35:38,865
This move Uncle Buyeong made...

435
00:35:40,283 --> 00:35:41,451
I'll look into it immediately.

436
00:35:46,331 --> 00:35:48,666
<i>The footsteps you take</i>

437
00:35:49,584 --> 00:35:54,881
<i>by risking your whole life is what's fate.</i>

438
00:35:55,799 --> 00:35:57,926
He knew I'd check the daily log.

439
00:36:09,687 --> 00:36:11,397
Team One, get armed and follow me.

440
00:36:11,689 --> 00:36:12,607
Yes, Your Majesty!

441
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,319
Team One,
be armed and get ready immediately.

442
00:36:26,538 --> 00:36:28,998
I'm asking you this to save lives,
not because I don't know.

443
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:31,793
Do you know Eosu Bookstore?

444
00:36:32,919 --> 00:36:34,546
The one who answers first will live.

445
00:36:35,088 --> 00:36:36,005
If you stay silent,

446
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,633
you will be beheaded.

447
00:36:39,217 --> 00:36:41,427
I do not know.
I really don't know anything.

448
00:36:41,511 --> 00:36:43,429
I've never even been to a bookstore.

449
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,765
You can't kill me

450
00:36:46,808 --> 00:36:51,354
because you need to interrogate me
to reach Prince Imperial Geum.

451
00:36:54,315 --> 00:36:55,692
I don't care what you know

452
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,695
because that information
won't help me reach Lee Lim.

453
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,866
You obviously only know
what can be spilled.

454
00:37:14,252 --> 00:37:15,545
And most importantly,

455
00:37:18,172 --> 00:37:20,300
I no longer want to obtain
any information from you.

456
00:37:23,845 --> 00:37:24,888
Then pull the trigger.

457
00:37:25,555 --> 00:37:26,848
Do it!

458
00:37:27,432 --> 00:37:30,351
Go ahead and kill me if you think you can!

459
00:37:35,273 --> 00:37:36,608
Yes, I will kill you.

460
00:37:36,941 --> 00:37:38,651
Your Majesty, please spare my life.

461
00:37:38,735 --> 00:37:40,904
Those bastards lied
that this was an amazing place.

462
00:37:41,571 --> 00:37:42,989
I want to go back.

463
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:44,324
I'll go back, Your Majesty!

464
00:37:44,407 --> 00:37:48,077
It's too late.
You're already dead in that world.

465
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:53,291
You committed the crime yourself,
so I'm sure you're well aware of it.

466
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,544
You two are guilty of causing chaos
in both worlds.

467
00:37:58,546 --> 00:38:00,256
You will stay here
and pay for what you did.

468
00:38:01,507 --> 00:38:03,426
Your Majesty. Spare my life, Your Majesty.

469
00:38:03,843 --> 00:38:04,802
Please spare me!

470
00:38:04,886 --> 00:38:05,929
Spare me, Your Majesty.

471
00:38:06,262 --> 00:38:07,180
Please don't kill me!

472
00:38:07,347 --> 00:38:09,933
Please spare me, Your Majesty!
Spare my life, Your Majesty!

473
00:38:11,601 --> 00:38:14,103
You'll behead me? Bullshit.

474
00:38:14,729 --> 00:38:18,191
Beheading was abolished ages ago
in the Kingdom of Corea!

475
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:27,200
I guess you forgot because
you're one of the traitor's henchmen.

476
00:38:29,327 --> 00:38:30,662
The King's words

477
00:38:32,747 --> 00:38:33,623
are the law.

478
00:38:36,626 --> 00:38:37,835
Royal Guards.

479
00:38:39,128 --> 00:38:41,589
Kim Gi-hwan, the traitor's henchman
who chose silence

480
00:38:44,676 --> 00:38:45,635
shall be beheaded.

481
00:38:47,011 --> 00:38:47,929
It is the King's order.

482
00:39:00,233 --> 00:39:01,442
<i>Breaking news.</i>

483
00:39:01,526 --> 00:39:03,361
<i>The Royal Court's press secretary
just announced</i>

484
00:39:03,444 --> 00:39:06,489
<i>that Kim Gi-hwan, one of the traitor's
followers, has been arrested.</i>

485
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,283
-<i>The press secretary</i>
-They'll actually behead him?

486
00:39:09,367 --> 00:39:10,618
-<i>also stated that</i>
-My gosh.

487
00:39:10,702 --> 00:39:12,328
<i>Kim Gi-hwan will be beheaded according to</i>

488
00:39:12,412 --> 00:39:14,747
-Gosh, that's ruthless.
-<i>the special law ordered by the King.</i>

489
00:39:15,081 --> 00:39:18,918
<i>This means that he will be executed
according to the Criminal Act.</i>

490
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,170
<i>The execution will take place
at midnight tonight.</i>

491
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:23,798
<i>The special law has never been
put to use before</i>

492
00:39:23,881 --> 00:39:25,967
<i>since King Lee Gon's enthronement.</i>

493
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,469
<i>It is being put to use
for the first time in 62 years.</i>

494
00:39:39,397 --> 00:39:41,774
Did you make steak and rice
for Koo Seo-ryeong or not?

495
00:39:42,483 --> 00:39:45,069
You didn't prepare
the rice in that uniform, did you?

496
00:39:48,364 --> 00:39:50,783
I rinsed the rice,
and then put on the military uniform.

497
00:39:53,453 --> 00:39:54,912
And when did you say you put it on?

498
00:39:55,663 --> 00:39:58,082
"At the most honorable moment"?

499
00:39:59,709 --> 00:40:00,626
It's true.

500
00:40:02,253 --> 00:40:05,214
The moment I propose
to the love of my life, for example.

501
00:40:06,758 --> 00:40:07,967
But you didn't wear it for me.

502
00:40:08,926 --> 00:40:10,928
I couldn't. I was in a hurry.

503
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:15,975
It's the best thing I've done
since coming to this world.

504
00:40:16,642 --> 00:40:19,896
I'm waiting for your answer, and the story
about Prime Minister Koo was a joke.

505
00:40:21,272 --> 00:40:22,523
You call that a proposal?

506
00:40:22,732 --> 00:40:26,652
You never asked me to be your queen.
You just told me to do it.

507
00:40:34,202 --> 00:40:35,453
So what's your answer?

508
00:40:36,412 --> 00:40:37,288
Will you do it?

509
00:40:47,131 --> 00:40:48,174
I'm going to punch you.

510
00:40:55,556 --> 00:40:56,599
Will you do it?

511
00:41:00,645 --> 00:41:01,979
If I say no,

512
00:41:03,564 --> 00:41:05,525
will I never see you again?

513
00:41:09,695 --> 00:41:10,738
So, it's a no?

514
00:41:13,449 --> 00:41:14,575
Not today.

515
00:41:20,706 --> 00:41:22,667
I've been doing some thinking.

516
00:41:23,292 --> 00:41:24,669
I'm just going to live for today

517
00:41:25,461 --> 00:41:26,963
and not think about anything else.

518
00:41:28,339 --> 00:41:29,882
As if today is the only ordinary day

519
00:41:30,675 --> 00:41:32,176
where we're allowed to be scandalous.

520
00:41:33,511 --> 00:41:34,512
That's what we should do.

521
00:41:36,097 --> 00:41:37,056
Let's just do that.

522
00:41:40,101 --> 00:41:41,310
Usually, in moments like this,

523
00:41:42,812 --> 00:41:44,647
couples pledge their eternal love
to each other.

524
00:41:45,189 --> 00:41:46,023
But

525
00:41:46,858 --> 00:41:48,025
we'll only live for today?

526
00:41:49,986 --> 00:41:50,820
That's right.

527
00:41:51,612 --> 00:41:52,822
There's no tomorrow for us.

528
00:41:53,573 --> 00:41:58,411
That's why I'm hoping today is a long day.

529
00:42:02,915 --> 00:42:04,375
That's why I'm holding your hand.

530
00:42:05,084 --> 00:42:06,294
Because we'll only live today.

531
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:14,802
And yet we'll only hold hands
and do nothing else?

532
00:42:16,762 --> 00:42:18,389
Do you even know what "scandalous" means?

533
00:42:20,141 --> 00:42:23,227
You ditched me
even when we were alone at your palace.

534
00:42:25,271 --> 00:42:26,898
Then you should have asked me to stay.

535
00:42:27,565 --> 00:42:29,108
I was being considerate of you.

536
00:42:31,402 --> 00:42:33,154
Next time, I won't be so considerate.

537
00:42:34,906 --> 00:42:37,742
There is no next time.
I told you that we'll only live for today.

538
00:42:38,326 --> 00:42:40,745
Gosh, where do I even start with you?

539
00:42:42,914 --> 00:42:43,915
Hey.

540
00:42:44,624 --> 00:42:45,499
Stop.

541
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:49,962
Have patience with me. I'm a fast learner.

542
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:52,590
I know that you can hear me.

543
00:42:53,633 --> 00:42:54,592
Hey.

544
00:43:15,821 --> 00:43:16,697
Excuse me!

545
00:43:19,116 --> 00:43:19,992
Excuse me.

546
00:43:23,287 --> 00:43:24,455
Yes, can I help you?

547
00:43:25,414 --> 00:43:26,415
Nice to meet you.

548
00:43:26,624 --> 00:43:29,085
I'm Koo Seo-ryeong, the Prime Minister of
the Kingdom of Corea.

549
00:43:34,966 --> 00:43:36,092
I'm sorry to bother you.

550
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:38,970
I'm going to have to check your ID.
I'm a police officer.

551
00:43:39,887 --> 00:43:44,267
Don't the police
usually show their badges first?

552
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,190
You look more like a criminal than a cop.

553
00:43:58,948 --> 00:44:01,367
Yes. I'm Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul
from Jongno Police Station.

554
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,579
You really are a cop.

555
00:44:12,044 --> 00:44:14,005
This has never happened to me before.

557
00:44:22,471 --> 00:44:24,056
What is your date of birth?

558
00:44:25,057 --> 00:44:26,142
July 26, 1982.

559
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,728
Did I do something wrong?

560
00:44:30,479 --> 00:44:31,814
No, it's fine.

561
00:44:32,565 --> 00:44:33,649
You may move along.

562
00:44:37,236 --> 00:44:39,697
I don't even know why I got so nervous.

563
00:44:40,197 --> 00:44:41,407
Have a good evening.

564
00:44:59,508 --> 00:45:01,844
I'll take these, and could you
throw those out for me?

565
00:45:01,927 --> 00:45:02,803
Sure.

566
00:45:16,067 --> 00:45:20,738

00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:22,907
DAD

568
00:45:24,575 --> 00:45:25,576
Hi, Dad.

569
00:45:26,744 --> 00:45:28,788
Yes, I'm on my way now.
I'll meet you at the store.

570
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:01,612
What's the liquid that's formed
when you grill mushrooms?

571
00:46:01,737 --> 00:46:02,863
You mean, pine mushrooms?

572
00:46:02,947 --> 00:46:04,240
These are king oyster mushrooms.

573
00:46:04,323 --> 00:46:06,200
Hey, hold on.

574
00:46:07,034 --> 00:46:09,203
This is great for boosting your stamina.

575
00:46:09,286 --> 00:46:10,871
There. Go.

576
00:46:11,205 --> 00:46:12,623
Dad, seriously!

577
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:13,916
What?

578
00:46:13,999 --> 00:46:16,168
We're going to eat pork.
Why do you want to buy chicken?

579
00:46:16,377 --> 00:46:17,962
We can eat this tomorrow.

580
00:46:18,045 --> 00:46:19,797
Hey, can't you just splurge?

581
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,923
-Goodness.
-Put it down.

582
00:48:22,253 --> 00:48:23,212
Hello, welcome.

583
00:48:26,882 --> 00:48:29,301
Can I see your menu?
This is my first time here.

584
00:48:29,969 --> 00:48:30,886
Here you go.

585
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:34,306
Hey, you.

586
00:48:47,194 --> 00:48:51,198
<i>57247093699959574966967627</i>

587
00:48:51,282 --> 00:48:54,910
<i>72407663033547594571382179</i>

588
00:48:55,661 --> 00:48:57,413
So, it's 3,481 seconds.

589
00:49:00,416 --> 00:49:01,792
I missed the beginning,

590
00:49:02,459 --> 00:49:03,377
but the second time...

591
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,546
She thinks you left the palace again...

592
00:49:06,505 --> 00:49:07,840
<i>For 121 seconds.</i>

593
00:49:08,757 --> 00:49:09,925
<i>Then for 841 seconds.</i>

594
00:49:11,594 --> 00:49:12,636
<i>And 961 seconds.</i>

595
00:49:13,846 --> 00:49:15,139
<i>Then 2,209 seconds.</i>

596
00:49:16,515 --> 00:49:17,433
<i>And lastly...</i>

597
00:49:43,417 --> 00:49:44,627
<i>The amount of frozen time</i>

598
00:49:45,377 --> 00:49:47,546
<i>is multiplying
by the square root of the prime number.</i>

599
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:54,053
<i>At this rate, time will stop
for a whole day the 62nd time it happens.</i>

600
00:49:55,638 --> 00:49:58,557
<i>In other words, there will come a moment</i>

601
00:50:00,267 --> 00:50:03,103
<i>when the worlds, both Tae-eul's and mine,
will stop forever.</i>

602
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,733
Your Majesty.

603
00:50:09,026 --> 00:50:10,444
We've found where Eosu Bookstore is.

604
00:50:10,944 --> 00:50:12,821
This is the prick that owns the store.

605
00:50:20,913 --> 00:50:22,247
He's alive?

606
00:50:25,125 --> 00:50:26,335
Just tell me what to do.

607
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,295
How dare you...

608
00:50:28,545 --> 00:50:29,588
<i>Your Highness!</i>

609
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:41,684
He was alive this whole time.

610
00:50:52,111 --> 00:50:54,905
EOSU BOOKSTORE

611
00:51:03,122 --> 00:51:03,956
<i>Tonight,</i>

612
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,377
<i>we will raid Eosu Bookstore,
the hideout of the traitor's followers.</i>

613
00:51:18,595 --> 00:51:21,181
Everything is clear.
Should we capture them alive?

614
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:32,860
Kill them.

615
00:51:42,494 --> 00:51:44,496
Why do I keep getting the same thing?

616
00:51:53,338 --> 00:51:54,214
There you are.

617
00:51:55,174 --> 00:51:56,216
Come to daddy.

618
00:52:17,529 --> 00:52:18,489
Damn it.

619
00:53:00,113 --> 00:53:01,114
<i>The bookstore?</i>

620
00:53:02,199 --> 00:53:03,158
Me?

621
00:53:03,242 --> 00:53:04,201
Why?

622
00:53:04,701 --> 00:53:05,828
Is that prick acting up?

623
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:07,871
He's no longer useful.

624
00:53:09,623 --> 00:53:11,917
I need you to take care of that bookstore.

625
00:53:13,544 --> 00:53:14,962
See? I told you.

626
00:53:15,712 --> 00:53:17,256
I don't have to take anything, right?

627
00:53:17,631 --> 00:53:20,175
When should I go? What would you
like me to do when I'm there?

628
00:53:32,813 --> 00:53:33,939
This is why...

629
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:41,738
I said you never know
what someone is really thinking.

630
00:54:16,857 --> 00:54:18,817
Check his left shoulder
for a gunshot wound.

631
00:54:30,329 --> 00:54:31,622
There's nothing, Your Majesty.

632
00:55:05,364 --> 00:55:06,406
<i>Eight.</i>

633
00:55:09,201 --> 00:55:10,202
<i>Car keys.</i>

634
00:55:52,869 --> 00:55:54,496
<i>Those with the same faces</i>

635
00:55:56,081 --> 00:55:57,457
<i>are stealing</i>

636
00:56:00,377 --> 00:56:01,503
<i>their counterparts' lives.</i>

637
00:56:08,051 --> 00:56:09,052
Sub-captain Seok.

638
00:56:10,637 --> 00:56:12,597
Retreat immediately

639
00:56:13,098 --> 00:56:14,558
and assemble all Royal Guards.

640
00:56:16,059 --> 00:56:19,521
The infantry unit and cavalry unit
are to be on standby, fully armed.

641
00:56:23,525 --> 00:56:27,070
<i>Hang in there just a little longer,
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.</i>

642
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:29,281
<i>I'm coming for you.</i>

643
00:56:30,198 --> 00:56:32,659
<i>I will find you no matter what.</i>

644
00:56:33,869 --> 00:56:36,246
<i>Please just be there,
no matter where you are.</i>

645
00:56:51,094 --> 00:56:52,471
What are you doing here, kiddo?

646
00:56:53,764 --> 00:56:55,140
Get out of here.

647
00:56:55,766 --> 00:56:57,142
I warn people of danger

648
00:56:57,768 --> 00:56:59,311
and defeat the enemy.

649
00:57:00,437 --> 00:57:01,521
What?

650
00:57:08,737 --> 00:57:09,613
By the way,

651
00:57:11,865 --> 00:57:13,158
you're in this world too.

652
00:57:14,367 --> 00:57:15,494
There's only one of me.

653
00:57:16,828 --> 00:57:18,080
I went to the other world.

654
00:57:34,471 --> 00:57:35,639
I'm trying to restore balance.

655
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,682
There are too many enemies.

656
00:57:47,317 --> 00:57:48,235
You...

657
00:57:49,778 --> 00:57:50,612
What is going on?

658
00:57:52,489 --> 00:57:53,782
Who are you?

659
00:58:03,333 --> 00:58:04,209
Run!

660
00:58:05,544 --> 00:58:07,087
She's up! Get her!

661
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:08,713
-You little...
-Don't let her get away!

662
00:59:10,275 --> 00:59:11,318
Shit, my phone.

663
00:59:13,695 --> 00:59:14,946
How do I get to Seoul from here?

664
00:59:15,488 --> 00:59:18,366
BUSAN PALACE

665
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:21,286
What?

666
00:59:22,037 --> 00:59:23,121
"Busan Palace"?

667
00:59:26,166 --> 00:59:27,667
Am I in the Kingdom of Corea now?

668
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:37,636
About the bookstore...

669
00:59:38,511 --> 00:59:41,932
Even the ones inside the main building
were shot to death.

670
00:59:50,607 --> 00:59:52,442
I thought he was a benevolent ruler.

671
00:59:53,944 --> 00:59:56,780
Who knew my nephew could be
such a blood-thirsty tyrant?

672
01:00:01,076 --> 01:00:03,787
We lost the woman. I sincerely apologize.

673
01:00:05,497 --> 01:00:07,374
About three of our guys
are chasing her, so--

674
01:00:14,965 --> 01:00:16,508
She must be headed to the main palace.

675
01:00:17,384 --> 01:00:18,343
Catch her at all costs.

676
01:00:19,928 --> 01:00:22,305
Gon will come even for her corpse,

677
01:00:23,765 --> 01:00:25,433
so bring her to me dead or alive

678
01:00:27,018 --> 01:00:29,354
There is something I must obtain
in exchange for her!

679
01:00:29,437 --> 01:00:31,189
-Yes, Your Highness!
-Yes, Your Highness!

680
01:03:06,845 --> 01:03:09,472
CALL THIS NUMBER
TO WISH HIS MAJESTY A HAPPY NEW YEAR

681
01:03:19,524 --> 01:03:24,237
<i>Wish the King of the Kingdom of Corea
a happy new year after the tone.</i>

682
01:03:26,656 --> 01:03:27,574
Gon.

683
01:03:29,826 --> 01:03:30,702
It's me,

684
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:32,203
Jeong Tae-eul.

685
01:03:35,415 --> 01:03:36,916
You won't believe me,

686
01:03:38,209 --> 01:03:40,170
but I'm in the Kingdom of Corea now.

687
01:03:41,129 --> 01:03:44,174
I'm being chased by someone.

688
01:03:46,259 --> 01:03:47,343
I'm headed

689
01:03:48,261 --> 01:03:49,762
to the palace now.

690
01:03:51,139 --> 01:03:52,223
I'll hurry.

691
01:03:52,849 --> 01:03:54,559
I'm on my way there now--

692
01:03:54,642 --> 01:03:56,060
<i>Message recorded.</i>

693
01:03:56,394 --> 01:03:58,146
<i>Thank you for using our service.</i>

694
01:03:59,731 --> 01:04:01,065
So look for me

695
01:04:02,859 --> 01:04:04,402
when you get this message.

696
01:07:38,408 --> 01:07:39,784
Protect her!

697
01:07:39,867 --> 01:07:41,703
She is the future queen
of the Kingdom of Corea.

Why are these scars appearing?

701

Just kill me!
