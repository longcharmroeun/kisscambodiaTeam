ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:06,617 --> 00:00:08,352
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:11,203 --> 00:00:12,538
<i>This story begins</i>

5
00:00:12,872 --> 00:00:15,249
<i>during King Sinmun's reign
in the Silla Dynasty.</i>

6
00:00:16,584 --> 00:00:18,627
<i>This is recorded in</i>
Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms.

7
00:00:19,503 --> 00:00:21,046
<i>"In spring of the year 682,</i>

8
00:00:21,797 --> 00:00:23,716
<i>King Sinmun received a bamboo flute</i>

9
00:00:24,508 --> 00:00:26,802
<i>from the Dragon King of the East Sea.</i>

10
00:00:30,473 --> 00:00:31,932
<i>When the flute is played,</i>

11
00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:34,727
<i>enemies would retreat,
diseases would be cured,</i>

12
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:38,355
<i>rain would fall during droughts,
the rainy season would end,</i>

13
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,024
<i>the wind would stop,</i>

14
00:00:40,858 --> 00:00:42,610
<i>and strong waves would subside."</i>

15
00:00:44,153 --> 00:00:45,404
Seeing its powers,

16
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,573
King Sinmun named the flute

17
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:49,700
"Manpasikjeok"

18
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:52,203
and designated it as a national treasure.

19
00:00:57,499 --> 00:00:59,418
Although for people
who do not believe the story,

20
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:02,505
it is merely a myth.

21
00:01:03,172 --> 00:01:04,798
Name, Lee Lim.

22
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,510
Born in February 1951.

23
00:01:07,676 --> 00:01:09,136
Currently aged 70

24
00:01:10,179 --> 00:01:11,096
in the year 2020.

25
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,556
BIRTHDATE: FEBRUARY 27, 1951

26
00:01:17,603 --> 00:01:18,646
Explain this.

27
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:20,689
For me, this is harder to believe.

28
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:24,735
I really am 70 this year.

29
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:27,112
I hardly aged

30
00:01:27,738 --> 00:01:29,573
since the winter of 1994.

31
00:01:30,699 --> 00:01:36,205
Since then, my time passed by slowly,
unlike you guys.

32
00:01:36,288 --> 00:01:37,289
Why did it pass by slowly?

33
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:38,791
You're just a guy born in 1951.

34
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:43,420
Because I finally got my hands
on the Manpasikjeok.

35
00:01:45,214 --> 00:01:47,716
I took it from my brother who had it,
but did not believe in it.

36
00:01:48,384 --> 00:01:49,260
So,

37
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:51,679
did you kill

38
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:53,097
your brother?

39
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,017
The Manpasikjeok was revealed
only once every 20 years

40
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,770
to wish peace upon the world.

41
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,438
Just answer yes or no.

42
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:02,982
So

43
00:02:03,774 --> 00:02:04,942
did you kill your brother?

44
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:07,486
Yes, I did.

45
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,448
He was allowed to see it every day.

46
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:14,827
My naive half-brother, who became King

47
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,663
just because he was born
the legitimate son,

48
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:20,124
did not do anything

49
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,543
when he had the world in his hands.

50
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,923
He did not even know
that the Manpasikjeok in his hands

51
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:32,303
<i>would bring the world to him.</i>

52
00:02:33,012 --> 00:02:35,723
<i>To be exact, two different worlds.</i>

53
00:02:36,473 --> 00:02:39,018
<i>I did expect</i>

54
00:02:40,102 --> 00:02:42,646
<i>that one day, my nephew</i>

55
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:46,275
<i>would face that legend too,</i>

56
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,695
<i>just like me.</i>

64
00:03:51,674 --> 00:03:52,508
Let's go.

65
00:03:53,175 --> 00:03:55,803
What I need is over there.

66
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,937
-You...
-Yes.

67
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,690
They're helping me, Your Majesty.

68
00:04:56,155 --> 00:04:57,239
Brother,

69
00:04:57,948 --> 00:04:59,324
what are you doing?

70
00:05:01,785 --> 00:05:03,078
Do you still not know

71
00:05:03,162 --> 00:05:04,788
what I'm about to do?

72
00:05:05,497 --> 00:05:06,623
Don't do this.

73
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,294
Put that sword down.

74
00:05:11,462 --> 00:05:12,671
This is treason.

75
00:05:12,754 --> 00:05:15,090
To you, it might be nothing but treason.

76
00:05:17,342 --> 00:05:19,970
But I picked up this sword
to gain something even bigger.

77
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,222
What is it
that you're so willing to kill for?

78
00:05:22,973 --> 00:05:24,641
Do you not fear
the punishment of the skies?

79
00:05:35,486 --> 00:05:37,779
The punishment of the skies?

80
00:05:38,447 --> 00:05:41,241
I plan to become the very being
who gives punishment from the skies.

81
00:05:41,325 --> 00:05:42,618
Your Majesty.

82
00:05:44,786 --> 00:05:45,787
Brother.

83
00:05:47,331 --> 00:05:49,917
God never created humans.

84
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,710
It was the weak

85
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:54,254
who created God.

86
00:06:55,232 --> 00:06:56,149
Father.

87
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:59,361
Father!

88
00:07:00,571 --> 00:07:02,531
Father!

89
00:07:02,614 --> 00:07:03,740
Father!

90
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:06,785
Father!

91
00:07:09,746 --> 00:07:11,164
Father.

92
00:07:14,126 --> 00:07:17,504
Father.

93
00:07:18,088 --> 00:07:19,423
His Majesty has already...

94
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:22,718
This is too bad.

95
00:07:25,888 --> 00:07:28,515
You're an orphan now, Your Highness.

96
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:46,909
Do you really think
you can hurt me with that?

97
00:07:47,284 --> 00:07:48,160
I will try!

98
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:08,764
This is treason.

99
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,476
I order the Royal Guards
to arrest the traitor, Lee Lim.

100
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:17,981
I deprive Prince Imperial Geum
of his royal status

101
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:19,775
and sentence him to the maximum penalty

102
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,902
in accordance with the national law.

103
00:08:25,155 --> 00:08:28,241
You sound like the crown prince
for the first time in your life.

104
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:34,915
I'm ready, sir.

105
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:53,141
I will do it myself.

106
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:06,363
I've waited all my life
for this very moment.

107
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,241
I hid my desires,
gathered people to assist me,

108
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,912
endured your foolish father and mine,

109
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:17,249
and quietly waited for this day
my entire life.

110
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,378
So how dare you...

111
00:09:22,087 --> 00:09:24,214
How dare a little kid like you...

112
00:09:24,715 --> 00:09:26,717
You useless and powerless punk...

113
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,262
How dare you mess this up?

114
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:38,288
Your Highness!

115
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:55,388
<i>Emergency alert.
There's an emergency in Cheonjongo.</i>

116
00:10:55,472 --> 00:10:56,932
<i>There's an emergency in Cheonjongo.</i>

117
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:02,229
Your Highness, we've lost too much time.
You need to get out of here.

118
00:11:02,312 --> 00:11:03,146
It won't take long.

119
00:11:11,446 --> 00:11:14,658
Sir, you won't be able to escape
once the Royal Guards get here.

120
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:47,065
Let's go.

121
00:11:47,858 --> 00:11:49,818
We're going to leave the palace right now!

122
00:12:12,716 --> 00:12:13,800
<i>Emergency alert.</i>

123
00:12:13,884 --> 00:12:17,012
<i>All Royal Guards gear up
and gather at Cheonjongo.</i>

Come back to us, Your Majesty.

128
00:13:06,478 --> 00:13:11,024
<i>Last night, Prince Imperial Geum

129
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,110
<i>The spokesperson of the Royal Family
announced that...</i>

130
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:17,864
<i>Prince Imperial Geum who is currently
wanted for murder and treason</i>

131
00:13:17,948 --> 00:13:19,741
<i>will be stripped of his position.</i>

132
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:23,662
So Crown Prince Lee Gon,
the first in line to the throne

133
00:13:24,245 --> 00:13:27,791
of the Kingdom of Corea,
will be crowned King.

<i>Second in line is
Prince Inpyeong's eldest son,</i>

<i>Prince Buyeong, Professor Lee Jong-in.</i>

136
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:40,595
Salute.

137
00:13:43,848 --> 00:13:44,724
At ease.

138
00:13:47,352 --> 00:13:49,646
You're here, Prince Buyeong.

139
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:56,861
Is the Crown Prince awake yet?

140
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,864
I heard his neck was severely injured.

141
00:14:00,991 --> 00:14:02,158
I am sorry to say this,

142
00:14:03,827 --> 00:14:08,957
but asking about the Crown Prince's state
in the current situation

143
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,960
could lead to misunderstandings.

144
00:14:12,794 --> 00:14:14,838
Whether I mention him or not,

145
00:14:15,046 --> 00:14:17,257
people will gossip about me.

146
00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:20,719
What about Lee Lim's whereabouts?

147
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:24,514
The Royal Guards and the police
are investigating together.

148
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,934
We're doing vehicle inspections.
Please open your trunk.

149
00:14:29,144 --> 00:14:31,646
<i>They closed off all the roads right away,</i>

150
00:14:32,564 --> 00:14:36,735
<i>If he is still in Busan,
I'm sure they will find him.</i>

151
00:14:40,572 --> 00:14:44,242
I hope so too, but he seems
to have thoroughly prepared for this.

152
00:14:45,744 --> 00:14:49,039
I believe he would have thought
of an escape plan first.

00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,692
How can this happen?

183
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,043
I was right.

184
00:18:23,586 --> 00:18:25,255
"Republic of Korea"?

185
00:18:33,972 --> 00:18:37,267
So, where is your brother right now?

186
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:09,632
This is how you were living?

187
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:12,218
You're living such a lowly life.

188
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:19,392
Well, you and I do look alike.

189
00:19:24,147 --> 00:19:24,981
But

190
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,026
we don't just look alike.

191
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:31,070
I am you.

192
00:19:32,655 --> 00:19:34,073
You in a different world.

193
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:41,080
But I'm

194
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:44,000
very different from you.

195
00:19:46,044 --> 00:19:47,629
I am much nobler

196
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,882
than you.

197
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:27,085
Uncle,

198
00:20:28,086 --> 00:20:29,420
how are you...

199
00:20:34,592 --> 00:20:35,718
standing?

200
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:54,445
Even in this world,
you've seen something you shouldn't have.

201
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:58,991
And you're holding something
you shouldn't be holding.

202
00:21:09,711 --> 00:21:13,423
KINGDOM OF COREA
CORONATION OF THE THIRD KING

203
00:21:32,483 --> 00:21:35,737
<i>The King is entering!</i>

204
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:52,962
KING LEE GON
THE THIRD KING OF THE KINGDOM OF COREA

205
00:22:29,665 --> 00:22:31,459
Long live the King!

206
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:33,753
-Long live the King!
-Long live the King!

207
00:22:33,836 --> 00:22:35,379
Long live the King!

208
00:22:36,005 --> 00:22:37,757
-Long live the King!
-Long live the King!

209
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,926
Long live the King!

210
00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:42,512
-Long live the King!
-Long live the King!

211
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,639
<i>Today is the 6th day
of the former King's funeral.</i>

212
00:22:44,722 --> 00:22:47,141
<i>After his coronation, King Lee Gon</i>

213
00:22:47,225 --> 00:22:49,936
<i>began his first duty as King, mourning
his father's death for 26 days</i>

214
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:52,063
<i>according to court laws.</i>

215
00:22:52,647 --> 00:22:54,815
<i>The public is watching
the young King's formality</i>

216
00:22:54,899 --> 00:22:59,445
<i>-with a sad heart.</i>
-Father...

217
00:23:00,071 --> 00:23:03,449
Father...

218
00:23:04,075 --> 00:23:07,411
Father...

219
00:23:07,912 --> 00:23:11,457
Father...

220
00:23:13,084 --> 00:23:15,294
Father...

221
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,469
Is this your husband?

222
00:23:24,345 --> 00:23:27,139
It seems he was in a hit-and-run accident
while he was drunk.

223
00:23:27,265 --> 00:23:29,684
I know you're startled,
but we'd appreciate your cooperation.

224
00:23:30,393 --> 00:23:31,561
Yes, he's my husband.

225
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:34,397
I was in the middle of work.

226
00:23:35,064 --> 00:23:36,691
Can I go since I've confirmed it?

227
00:23:37,275 --> 00:23:38,484
Oh, yes.

228
00:23:38,776 --> 00:23:41,153
You may have his body transferred
tomorrow afternoon.

229
00:23:45,032 --> 00:23:45,992
I...

230
00:23:48,911 --> 00:23:50,329
I heard that

231
00:23:51,914 --> 00:23:53,791
the government
will cremate the body for you

232
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,876
if you sign something.

233
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:13,853
Well, at least he had a meal
before his death.

234
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:06,489
I guess there is a god.

235
00:25:07,948 --> 00:25:09,784
My husband just died.

236
00:25:11,827 --> 00:25:14,538
I prayed every day that he'd die.

237
00:25:15,831 --> 00:25:17,792
I thought I would end up

238
00:25:18,209 --> 00:25:20,586
either dying or killing him

239
00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:23,005
before leaving this house.

240
00:25:26,175 --> 00:25:27,301
But...

241
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,889
But someone killed him for me.

242
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,649
And the government
will cremate his body for me.

243
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:43,818
Now...

244
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:45,986
I can leave this house with Ji-hun...

245
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:12,012
Father...

246
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:16,392
Father...

247
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:20,563
Father...

248
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:24,442
Father...

249
00:26:24,525 --> 00:26:25,693
Father...

250
00:26:25,776 --> 00:26:26,694
Hey.

251
00:26:27,778 --> 00:26:29,447
Hey, eat this.

252
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,948
I'll give this to you.

253
00:26:33,033 --> 00:26:33,951
Put that away.

254
00:26:35,953 --> 00:26:39,707
Father...

255
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:41,417
He's not moving an inch.

256
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,376
Right.

257
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,003
He shouldn't talk to the King like that.

258
00:26:44,086 --> 00:26:47,214
It's all part of a plan.

259
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:49,675
Just wait and see.

260
00:27:15,284 --> 00:27:17,828
Hey, is it fun to study?

261
00:27:20,956 --> 00:27:22,833
How are you getting into this place?

262
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:23,918
Get out.

263
00:27:24,585 --> 00:27:26,378
Do you think this whole place is yours?

264
00:27:26,504 --> 00:27:28,130
Yes, this place is all mine.

265
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:29,673
So get out.

266
00:27:29,757 --> 00:27:31,258
You're lying.

267
00:27:31,842 --> 00:27:33,177
Who's your father?

268
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,262
He's your father's friend!

269
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:52,882
The funeral process is finally over.

270
00:28:56,719 --> 00:29:00,639
You've done well on performing
your first duty, Your Majesty.

271
00:29:14,069 --> 00:29:16,947
I miss my father.

272
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:22,578
I miss my father.

273
00:29:22,912 --> 00:29:23,829
Yes.

274
00:29:24,413 --> 00:29:25,915
I know, Your Majesty.

275
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:29,877
I know.

276
00:29:47,228 --> 00:29:49,188
Why are you crying?

277
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:52,483
Don't cry.

278
00:30:18,175 --> 00:30:19,760
You should stop crying too.

279
00:30:20,511 --> 00:30:21,595
Here.

280
00:30:25,015 --> 00:30:28,769
From now on, you're the Unbreakable Sword.

281
00:30:29,645 --> 00:30:32,690
The Unbreakable Board? What's that?

282
00:30:35,651 --> 00:30:38,654
What's your name, though?

283
00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:41,657
Jo Yeong. What about you?

284
00:30:42,324 --> 00:30:47,162
I am Lee Gon,
the King of the Kingdom of Corea.

285
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:49,373
Okay, I get it.

286
00:30:49,456 --> 00:30:50,708
Anyway,

287
00:30:51,709 --> 00:30:53,168
thank you for this.

288
00:31:11,645 --> 00:31:12,563
My goodness.

289
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:26,827
There's someone over here!

290
00:31:27,411 --> 00:31:29,163
Help! There's someone here!

291
00:31:29,496 --> 00:31:33,834
Help! Someone help!

292
00:31:36,045 --> 00:31:41,800
ROYAL HOSPITAL OF COREA

293
00:31:47,181 --> 00:31:48,307
Oh, gosh.

294
00:31:49,475 --> 00:31:50,476
Hello.

295
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:54,813
This can't be revealed to the public,

296
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:58,734
so I had to ask you
to perform the autopsy yourself.

297
00:32:00,611 --> 00:32:03,906
I have no idea what to do about this.

298
00:32:04,573 --> 00:32:05,783
Calm down.

299
00:32:06,283 --> 00:32:08,077
You made a wise choice.

300
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:10,746
I heard that the Royal Guards

301
00:32:11,497 --> 00:32:12,790
think he committed suicide.

302
00:32:13,374 --> 00:32:16,377
Yes, they say it seems like it.

303
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:19,588
He probably had nowhere to run.

304
00:32:20,464 --> 00:32:25,511
They say all his bones were broken.
Probably due to the waves.

305
00:32:25,594 --> 00:32:26,970
Even so,

306
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,973
this can never be suicide.

307
00:32:31,725 --> 00:32:32,768
This has to be

308
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,230
a shooting by the Royal Guards.

309
00:32:36,814 --> 00:32:37,731
Your Highness.

310
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:40,776
I will have to make a false statement

311
00:32:41,485 --> 00:32:44,279
for the young King
and the Royal Court that is in chaos.

312
00:32:45,489 --> 00:32:46,615
Do you understand?

313
00:32:47,324 --> 00:32:49,618
Yes, Your Highness.

314
00:33:24,778 --> 00:33:29,032
FORMER KING'S BASTARD LEE LIM
MEETS TRAGIC END

315
00:34:13,535 --> 00:34:14,912
Your Highness,

316
00:34:16,163 --> 00:34:17,456
you were alive?

317
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:19,541
You believed I was, didn't you?

318
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:21,793
Yes, I did.

319
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:24,254
I believed you were alive.

320
00:34:30,427 --> 00:34:31,845
But how...

321
00:34:34,264 --> 00:34:35,641
How can you still look the same?

322
00:34:36,225 --> 00:34:37,935
It has been over a decade
since I last saw you.

323
00:34:38,018 --> 00:34:39,728
How did you not age at all?

324
00:34:41,104 --> 00:34:42,689
You've held out well.

325
00:34:44,191 --> 00:34:45,526
Let me show you

326
00:34:46,735 --> 00:34:48,654
a new world.

327
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:51,448
Yes, Your Highness.

328
00:34:58,836 --> 00:35:02,089
KINGDOM OF COREA, BUSAN MAIN PALACE
THE FALL OF 2019

329
00:35:11,015 --> 00:35:12,808
SUNGWOON GROUP
LABOR RELATIONS BOARD

330
00:35:12,892 --> 00:35:15,144
THEY WILL ONLY ADVISE GROUP
ON LABOR UNIONS AND SUCCESSIONS

331
00:35:30,993 --> 00:35:32,620
Yes, I'm caught today as well.

332
00:35:36,248 --> 00:35:38,417
Prime Minister,
please step up onto the platform.

333
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:40,961
I need to do an additional
pat-down search.

334
00:35:46,717 --> 00:35:49,553
Wireless bras
don't support my breasts properly.

335
00:35:50,721 --> 00:35:52,389
I'll begin the pat-down search.

336
00:36:48,612 --> 00:36:49,738
I will do it myself.

337
00:36:51,407 --> 00:36:52,950
-Are you new?
-Yes, sir.

338
00:36:53,033 --> 00:36:55,911
His Majesty does not like others
touching his body.

339
00:36:55,995 --> 00:36:58,497
This may be a mistake,
but if it happens again, it's intentional.

340
00:36:58,622 --> 00:36:59,623
Keep that in mind.

341
00:36:59,707 --> 00:37:01,500
Yes, sir.

342
00:37:04,003 --> 00:37:06,046
His Majesty is going
to the VIP horse riding course.

343
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:07,715
I'm going to drop by my bedroom first.

344
00:37:29,236 --> 00:37:30,237
All right.

345
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,909
1. PICTURE IN THE HALLWAY
2. VASE NEXT TO BED

346
00:37:35,993 --> 00:37:38,328
We have to replace these every month,

347
00:37:38,412 --> 00:37:40,289
so make sure to write down
all the locations.

348
00:37:40,372 --> 00:37:43,250
The first one is behind the painting,

349
00:37:43,542 --> 00:37:45,210
and it goes counterclockwise.

350
00:37:45,878 --> 00:37:48,130
And don't say a word to His Majesty.

351
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,465
Gosh,

352
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,218
I heard this talisman is the most
effective for finding a lover.

353
00:37:55,471 --> 00:37:57,598
What? Why aren't you answering?

354
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,269
I almost had a heart attack.

355
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,108
I heard the Prime Minister came early
and is waiting right now.

356
00:38:08,734 --> 00:38:10,819
What are you doing here?

357
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,572
These really seem to be effective.

358
00:38:14,156 --> 00:38:17,326
I guess they have
the power to pull people toward you.

359
00:38:18,494 --> 00:38:21,080
Prime Minister Koo must be coming early
every time because of these.

360
00:38:21,163 --> 00:38:24,083
She might actually become the Queen.

361
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:25,667
Oh, that bitch...

362
00:38:26,919 --> 00:38:28,629
I mean... My goodness.

363
00:38:29,129 --> 00:38:31,715
She cannot become the Queen.

364
00:38:32,216 --> 00:38:34,468
You said
you don't believe in superstitions.

365
00:38:34,551 --> 00:38:36,386
These don't have any powers--

366
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:38,847
I don't, but you believe in them.

367
00:38:38,931 --> 00:38:39,932
What?

368
00:38:40,015 --> 00:38:42,976
You believe that someone might
actually answer your desperate prayers.

369
00:38:43,685 --> 00:38:46,188
I have my reasons, you know.

370
00:38:46,939 --> 00:38:51,401
The royal court
is unstable more than ever.

371
00:38:51,485 --> 00:38:55,280
So, you know, you should get married--

372
00:38:55,364 --> 00:38:56,532
I do not want to.

373
00:38:57,533 --> 00:39:00,702
It is the King's duty
to produce an heir, and--

374
00:39:00,786 --> 00:39:01,954
I am not interested.

375
00:39:02,454 --> 00:39:07,584
How can you not be interested
when you are so young and decent?

376
00:39:07,793 --> 00:39:10,754
My goodness. This is unbelievable.

377
00:39:10,838 --> 00:39:15,050
You are the very first woman to be
so rude to me since I sat on the throne.

378
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,139
Goodness.

379
00:39:21,557 --> 00:39:22,683
Oh, my.

380
00:39:22,766 --> 00:39:24,726
-You shall be beheaded.
-What?

381
00:39:26,979 --> 00:39:29,898
Tell Prime Minister Koo
we'll meet in two hours as planned.

382
00:39:30,941 --> 00:39:34,778
My gosh. These are really expensive.

383
00:39:42,786 --> 00:39:46,165
Let's put these clockwise this time.

384
00:40:32,085 --> 00:40:34,796
Yeong, I found talismans again.

385
00:40:35,297 --> 00:40:37,966
There were 8 today. That's 51 in total.

386
00:40:39,301 --> 00:40:40,177
Really?

387
00:40:43,889 --> 00:40:44,848
Why?

388
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:46,683
Is it not 51?

389
00:40:46,975 --> 00:40:49,478
Did she hide more than that
when you were keeping a lookout?

390
00:40:51,313 --> 00:40:53,315
I didn't take an active part in it.

391
00:40:53,398 --> 00:40:56,276
Well, I'm going to reprimand you actively,
so just wait.

392
00:41:17,965 --> 00:41:20,092
I know I'm here early, Your Majesty.

393
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,970
The weather was nice,

394
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,973
and I missed Maximus, so I hurried a bit.

395
00:41:28,308 --> 00:41:29,601
Hi, Maximus.

396
00:41:31,311 --> 00:41:32,437
It doesn't like women.

397
00:41:32,688 --> 00:41:34,273
And it's spoiled, so it bites people too.

398
00:41:34,356 --> 00:41:35,399
Me too.

399
00:41:36,483 --> 00:41:38,026
I bite people often as well.

400
00:41:39,027 --> 00:41:40,529
Can you wave your hand?

401
00:41:40,612 --> 00:41:43,240
They're filming us 50 meters away.

402
00:41:43,323 --> 00:41:45,993
The Royal Public Affairs Office
thought a photo here would look great.

403
00:41:47,661 --> 00:41:49,329
It'll be hard to walk together.

404
00:41:50,163 --> 00:41:51,164
Just stand over here.

405
00:41:51,248 --> 00:41:52,749
Your left face is pretty.

406
00:41:54,042 --> 00:41:56,003
And next time,
wear more comfortable shoes.

407
00:41:56,086 --> 00:41:57,170
You're pretty considerate.

408
00:42:03,468 --> 00:42:06,555
You shortened the state affairs
report time down to half,

409
00:42:06,638 --> 00:42:08,515
so I had no time to change my shoes.

410
00:42:08,598 --> 00:42:11,059
Your reports last for
an average of 18 minutes,

411
00:42:11,601 --> 00:42:13,687
so I believe 30 minutes is enough.

412
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,105
Shall we begin then?

413
00:42:15,188 --> 00:42:17,190
Should we shorten five more minutes
since we're busy?

414
00:42:19,526 --> 00:42:23,238
Like I said in my written report,
the country is peaceful,

415
00:42:24,114 --> 00:42:25,574
and the people are happy.

416
00:42:26,783 --> 00:42:29,036
And they'll be happier
when they see our photo.

417
00:42:38,462 --> 00:42:39,880
It is all thanks to you.

418
00:42:46,636 --> 00:42:48,722
I'm thinking of learning
horse riding as well.

419
00:42:49,389 --> 00:42:51,141
Do you think I'd do well, Your Majesty?

420
00:42:51,224 --> 00:42:53,643
When you learn to ride,
this is what you hear first.

421
00:42:54,561 --> 00:42:56,480
"If you have trained honestly every time,

422
00:42:57,314 --> 00:43:00,817
your horse will take you
to the edge of the world."

423
00:43:03,695 --> 00:43:06,531
Prime Minister, are you honest?

424
00:43:09,493 --> 00:43:10,994
I received your report,

425
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:13,955
and we took enough photos,
so shall we end it here?

426
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,085
I have to get washed up
for my next schedule.

427
00:43:27,886 --> 00:43:29,721
Oh, my gosh!

428
00:43:36,395 --> 00:43:38,271
You nearly gave me a heart attack!

429
00:43:39,064 --> 00:43:40,190
This is treason.

430
00:43:41,525 --> 00:43:43,902
You should hurry. You might be late.

431
00:43:43,985 --> 00:43:45,570
What will you do if I'm not late?

432
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:48,281
And how long have you been standing there?

433
00:43:49,783 --> 00:43:51,284
Do you really want to know?

434
00:43:51,368 --> 00:43:53,036
You're getting beheaded for sure.

435
00:43:53,203 --> 00:43:55,372
This is when we say,
"You reap what you sow."

436
00:43:55,664 --> 00:43:57,124
You bolt like this all the time.

437
00:43:57,707 --> 00:44:00,293
And I don't know if you've dug
some kind of tunnel in your bathroom.

438
00:44:00,961 --> 00:44:03,004
How can you say "bolt" to your King?

439
00:44:03,088 --> 00:44:05,799
As you ordered, we got rid of the term
"single-parent family."

440
00:44:06,133 --> 00:44:06,967
And the banners.

441
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:08,301
Yes, good job.

442
00:44:10,011 --> 00:44:12,681
But how can you talk like that
to your King?

443
00:44:13,682 --> 00:44:15,183
Everything here is mine.

444
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:17,644
Get it? It's all mine!

445
00:44:23,942 --> 00:44:25,235
You know that now, don't you?

446
00:44:26,361 --> 00:44:28,405
Hey, Unbreakable Sword.
Aren't you going to answer me?

447
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:29,948
Do you get it now?

448
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,951
FAIRY TALES TOLD BY THE KING

449
00:44:33,034 --> 00:44:38,081
"Alice didn't even think
about how she would return

450
00:44:38,623 --> 00:44:41,585
and jumped into the hole
after the White Rabbit.

451
00:44:42,377 --> 00:44:46,298
She fell down and down.

452
00:44:47,382 --> 00:44:49,301
She was falling endlessly.

453
00:44:50,135 --> 00:44:55,223
She said in a loud voice, 'How many miles

454
00:44:55,474 --> 00:44:56,808
have I fallen?'"

455
00:44:57,809 --> 00:44:59,895
This is my favorite book.

456
00:45:00,437 --> 00:45:02,772
The author was a mathematician, too.

457
00:45:03,648 --> 00:45:05,358
How is it? Is it interesting?

458
00:45:05,442 --> 00:45:07,027
-No!
-No!

459
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:08,153
It's boring.

460
00:45:10,614 --> 00:45:14,576
I've never seen anyone talk
so honestly to me since I became King.

461
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,204
Your Majesty, do you have a girlfriend?

462
00:45:18,246 --> 00:45:20,081
This is what we really need to ask.

463
00:45:20,165 --> 00:45:21,458
Oh, no.

464
00:45:23,668 --> 00:45:27,964
So even this young girl
is worried about the royal court.

465
00:45:29,883 --> 00:45:30,717
All right.

466
00:45:31,676 --> 00:45:34,387
I know who ordered you to ask that,

467
00:45:35,305 --> 00:45:36,306
but I'll answer you.

468
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:40,519
I do not have a girlfriend yet.

469
00:45:42,979 --> 00:45:46,233
Then you should follow
the White Rabbit too, Your Majesty.

470
00:45:46,858 --> 00:45:48,026
Should I?

471
00:45:49,945 --> 00:45:52,405
All right, then I guess
I should keep reading.

472
00:45:52,489 --> 00:45:55,325
-"Alice..."
-No!

473
00:45:55,408 --> 00:45:57,786
It's boring. Please!

474
00:46:17,013 --> 00:46:19,432
-Move!
-Hey! Move it!

475
00:46:19,516 --> 00:46:21,351
Find her! Where the hell did she go?

476
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,335
Long strides. Keep it firm.

477
00:46:47,419 --> 00:46:48,295
Navy Academy.

478
00:46:48,378 --> 00:46:49,629
-The 88th class!
-The 88th class!

479
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,091
-Navy Academy.
-The 88th class!

480
00:46:53,675 --> 00:46:54,551
Navy Academy.

481
00:46:54,801 --> 00:46:56,136
-The 88th class!
-The 88th class!

482
00:47:12,152 --> 00:47:13,862
THE 88TH CLASS WILL TAKE
THE ROWING CUP AGAIN

483
00:47:22,287 --> 00:47:26,875
Hey, men should wear little
and move a lot!

484
00:47:26,958 --> 00:47:30,503
Hey, some men look awesome
even when they're all covered up.

485
00:47:31,338 --> 00:47:32,172
This is so great.

486
00:47:39,471 --> 00:47:40,847
He's moving to the finish line.

487
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:49,356
1. NAVY 88TH CLASS
2. UX CONSTRUCTION 3. ZENIST

488
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,733
Yes!

489
00:48:11,586 --> 00:48:13,421
You'll need some water later.

490
00:48:13,755 --> 00:48:15,882
Iced water for 1,000 won.
I have iced water here.

491
00:48:19,135 --> 00:48:20,220
Hey, my water!

492
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,930
That crazy bitch! Damn it!

493
00:48:22,013 --> 00:48:23,473
I haven't even sold any today yet!

494
00:48:23,556 --> 00:48:26,768
-We are!
-Descendants of the Admiral Yi Sun-sin!

495
00:48:26,851 --> 00:48:29,145
-If we fight, we win! Yes!
-If we fight, we win! Yes!

496
00:48:31,773 --> 00:48:33,400
That way. Run!

497
00:48:34,776 --> 00:48:35,860
Where is she?

498
00:48:35,944 --> 00:48:37,612
Damn it, move aside!

499
00:48:37,696 --> 00:48:38,655
Move! Come on!

500
00:48:38,738 --> 00:48:40,281
Damn it!

501
00:48:44,077 --> 00:48:47,497
I'm really serious right now, okay?

502
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:49,332
If you don't want to die, move aside!

503
00:48:49,416 --> 00:48:51,334
Boss, wait.

504
00:48:51,418 --> 00:48:53,128
Don't move. Stay still.

505
00:48:53,211 --> 00:48:54,170
-You idiot!
-Stay still.

506
00:48:54,254 --> 00:48:55,714
How can I get her if I stay still?

507
00:48:55,797 --> 00:48:57,173
What's this red thing on you?

508
00:48:57,757 --> 00:48:59,300
What is that?

509
00:48:59,384 --> 00:49:00,468
Put your hands up!

510
00:49:00,552 --> 00:49:02,137
-What? Why...
-What's going on?

511
00:49:03,596 --> 00:49:05,557
Soldiers? Why are soldiers here?

512
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:06,975
Why are they...

513
00:49:07,058 --> 00:49:08,101
I'm sorry.

514
00:49:08,852 --> 00:49:10,478
We should get away from here first.

515
00:49:12,063 --> 00:49:13,648
Team One, take those jerks to the police.

516
00:49:13,732 --> 00:49:15,734
Team Two, let's escort
the VIP away from here.

517
00:49:25,827 --> 00:49:26,745
Your Majesty.

518
00:49:30,707 --> 00:49:34,377
-Over there! His Majesty went that way!
-My gosh...

519
00:49:50,769 --> 00:49:51,644
What?

520
00:49:53,313 --> 00:49:57,066
Mom, His Majesty is really following
the White Rabbit with the clock.

521
00:50:49,577 --> 00:50:50,995
You have really good stamina.

522
00:50:51,704 --> 00:50:53,915
You rowed 2,000 meters
and you ran like that right after.

523
00:50:54,874 --> 00:50:56,292
Why did you suddenly run like that?

524
00:51:00,505 --> 00:51:02,131
I just saw the White Rabbit
with the clock.

525
00:51:02,215 --> 00:51:03,508
What do you mean?

526
00:51:03,591 --> 00:51:06,052
Are you saying
you saw a rabbit or a clock?

527
00:51:11,057 --> 00:51:13,184
Weren't you listening
when I was reading <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>?

528
00:51:13,268 --> 00:51:15,395
I was busy organizing my team's schedules.

529
00:51:15,478 --> 00:51:16,771
You really need some

530
00:51:18,106 --> 00:51:19,482
fairy tales in your life.

531
00:51:20,441 --> 00:51:22,902
And I think you need some shoes,
Your Majesty.

532
00:51:24,779 --> 00:51:25,697
These aren't my shoes.

533
00:51:29,158 --> 00:51:31,119
You must wear this from now on.

534
00:51:31,578 --> 00:51:33,538
You're going to protect me anyway.

535
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:35,748
Still, you must wear this.

536
00:51:37,125 --> 00:51:39,502
Will you feel better if I do?

537
00:51:41,337 --> 00:51:42,881
Then you can wear two for me.

538
00:51:43,673 --> 00:51:45,425
I'm really going to get a warning
if you don't listen.

539
00:51:45,508 --> 00:51:47,468
You're the captain.
Who would give you a warning?

540
00:51:48,052 --> 00:51:48,928
My sense of duty.

541
00:51:54,642 --> 00:51:56,060
You just made it really awkward.

542
00:51:57,645 --> 00:52:00,648
We caught all the men
who caused the scene at the competition.

543
00:52:00,899 --> 00:52:03,359
And we're looking for
the White Rabbit with the clock you saw.

544
00:52:04,277 --> 00:52:06,988
I will check whether it is a rabbit
or a clock once when we find it.

545
00:52:20,126 --> 00:52:22,629
Are you having fun, Captain Jo?

546
00:52:23,296 --> 00:52:24,505
Don't.

547
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:27,050
Don't do what?

548
00:52:28,384 --> 00:52:31,304
Why do you want to catch
the culprit yourself?

549
00:52:32,138 --> 00:52:33,765
Do you want to get a Brave Citizen Award?

550
00:52:33,848 --> 00:52:35,224
Why would I catch the culprit?

551
00:52:35,475 --> 00:52:38,144
You should be catching the culprit
as the captain of the Royal Guards.

552
00:52:42,607 --> 00:52:44,442
I'm not catching anyone.
I'm just trying to find

553
00:52:45,944 --> 00:52:47,320
the face that only I can recognize.

554
00:52:52,742 --> 00:52:54,827
Every time something like this happens,

555
00:52:56,704 --> 00:52:58,581
it feels like that person is there.

556
00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:02,043
When it happened 25 years ago,

557
00:53:03,336 --> 00:53:04,170
and today as well.

558
00:53:06,005 --> 00:53:07,590
It's been 25 years.

559
00:53:08,591 --> 00:53:10,301
Your savior must have aged a lot.

560
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:12,929
Do you think you can recognize the face?

561
00:53:14,347 --> 00:53:15,431
I'm not sure.

562
00:53:16,975 --> 00:53:19,644
We might have already met unknowingly.

563
00:53:22,939 --> 00:53:23,856
But

564
00:53:26,317 --> 00:53:28,611
why hasn't my savior ever come to see me?

565
00:53:31,072 --> 00:53:32,865
Because you've grown up well.

566
00:53:34,158 --> 00:53:37,286
You don't need anyone's help now.

567
00:53:45,795 --> 00:53:47,213
You're not mad at me anymore.

568
00:53:47,588 --> 00:53:48,464
My dear Yeong.

569
00:53:49,841 --> 00:53:50,842
How about a glass of beer?

570
00:53:51,884 --> 00:53:52,885
No, thank you.

571
00:53:56,097 --> 00:53:57,181
You can go home.

572
00:54:23,624 --> 00:54:27,545
JEONG TAE-EUL
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

573
00:54:37,722 --> 00:54:38,848
I'm older than you now.

574
00:54:41,434 --> 00:54:42,727
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

575
00:54:45,438 --> 00:54:51,569
LIEUTENANT JEONG TAE-EUL
DATE OF BIRTH: MAY 27TH, 1990

576
00:55:06,709 --> 00:55:09,670
REPUBLIC OF KOREA,
THE FALL OF 2019

577
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:35,113
Oh, my. She totally crashed into it.

578
00:55:35,196 --> 00:55:37,782
I think that'll cost about 370,000 won.

579
00:55:38,324 --> 00:55:40,201
She didn't have to hit it that hard.

580
00:55:40,284 --> 00:55:41,702
My goodness.

581
00:55:43,496 --> 00:55:45,289
Hello, this is the security office.

582
00:55:45,373 --> 00:55:46,457
You live in Unit 405, right?

583
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,001
-There's some bad news.
-Oh, no. What do I do?

584
00:55:49,085 --> 00:55:52,296
Some woman just crashed
her car into yours!

585
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:53,589
Oh, my gosh. What do I do?

586
00:55:58,427 --> 00:56:00,221
I'm sorry.

587
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:10,481
What?

588
00:56:10,565 --> 00:56:12,358
What? What's she doing?

589
00:56:15,945 --> 00:56:17,321
Oh, gosh. She's insane.

590
00:56:17,405 --> 00:56:20,116
Hey, that woman over there.
Hey, stop right there!

591
00:56:20,199 --> 00:56:22,660
-Hey!
-It's illegal if you just leave. No, stop!

592
00:56:22,743 --> 00:56:24,537
Hey, ma'am. Stop!

593
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:25,830
Stop!

594
00:56:25,913 --> 00:56:26,914
Did you see that?

595
00:56:26,998 --> 00:56:29,250
You should come down. All right.

596
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,628
He won't come down.

597
00:56:33,296 --> 00:56:35,464
Only delivery guys go up to his house.

598
00:56:35,756 --> 00:56:39,051
-He hasn't come down for quite a while.
-I'm telling you, he'll come down.

599
00:56:39,135 --> 00:56:41,637
Bad guys are more sensitive
when it comes to others breaking the law.

600
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,307
This is the most effective method.

601
00:56:45,725 --> 00:56:48,060
Kim Bok-man and two others
have left the house.

602
00:56:48,769 --> 00:56:50,313
Okay. I'll block their escape route.

603
00:56:50,396 --> 00:56:51,439
-Okay.
-Right.

604
00:56:54,901 --> 00:56:57,028
Oh, no. This is awful.

605
00:56:57,111 --> 00:56:58,362
What happened?

606
00:56:58,446 --> 00:56:59,864
Damn it!

607
00:56:59,947 --> 00:57:01,866
Mister, where did this bitch go? Where?

608
00:57:01,949 --> 00:57:03,826
The bitch who crashed into my car.
Where is she?

609
00:57:10,124 --> 00:57:11,500
Tae-eul, are you okay?

610
00:57:12,251 --> 00:57:15,796
I'm fine. You know.
I've done this many times.

611
00:57:16,422 --> 00:57:17,673
I'm not hurt. Don't worry.

612
00:57:17,757 --> 00:57:19,759
I mean, is your outfit really okay?

613
00:57:19,842 --> 00:57:21,761
Your top and bottom
really don't match right now.

614
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,555
What's wrong with my outfit?

615
00:57:24,931 --> 00:57:29,143
It's all about being natural.
It emphasizes the colors of these clothes.

616
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,104
I'm dressed as a chic,
professional city girl.

617
00:57:32,521 --> 00:57:33,898
I think I look pretty great.

618
00:57:33,981 --> 00:57:36,734
You should've dressed up properly.
Why only focus on the colors?

619
00:57:42,782 --> 00:57:44,533
She has such a filthy temper.

620
00:57:49,664 --> 00:57:51,874
Wait, there's a weird smell.

621
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,459
Come down.

622
00:57:57,755 --> 00:57:59,465
So I'm saying, some woman just

623
00:57:59,548 --> 00:58:01,717
crashed her car into yours
and just drove off...

624
00:58:05,846 --> 00:58:08,099
It's that car.
The one driving backward like that.

625
00:58:08,182 --> 00:58:10,142
You drove off naturally,
but why are you coming...

626
00:58:10,226 --> 00:58:12,144
Hey! Ma'am! What are you doing?

627
00:58:12,228 --> 00:58:13,437
Hey! Damn it.

628
00:58:15,439 --> 00:58:17,024
Hey! Damn it!

629
00:58:17,483 --> 00:58:18,359
Damn it!

630
00:58:21,946 --> 00:58:23,114
Ma'am...

631
00:58:23,281 --> 00:58:24,532
What a crazy bitch.

632
00:58:24,615 --> 00:58:26,784
Hey, do you have a death wish?

633
00:58:30,871 --> 00:58:32,748
Oh, it hurts. My back!

634
00:58:37,586 --> 00:58:39,130
Wait, I know this smell. Oh, no.

635
00:58:39,922 --> 00:58:41,924
We found a body in the trunk.

636
00:58:42,008 --> 00:58:44,593
We're changing this
from an illegal gambling website case

637
00:58:44,677 --> 00:58:45,761
to a murder case.

638
00:58:45,845 --> 00:58:47,013
No!

639
00:58:47,096 --> 00:58:48,431
I don't know that person!

640
00:58:48,514 --> 00:58:51,434
I really don't know! I didn't kill him!

641
00:58:51,517 --> 00:58:52,852
-Now give me your wrists.
-Damn it!

642
00:59:09,994 --> 00:59:12,413
The two others are heading that way.

643
00:59:16,542 --> 00:59:17,752
-Damn it.
-Hey.

644
00:59:18,252 --> 00:59:20,338
<i>One is going towards the playground.</i>

645
00:59:21,422 --> 00:59:23,299
<i>You are mine.</i>

646
00:59:33,976 --> 00:59:35,102
Hey!

647
00:59:42,693 --> 00:59:44,028
Shit.

648
00:59:51,577 --> 00:59:53,954
Over here. That's it.

649
00:59:54,038 --> 00:59:55,748
-Okay!
-Damn it. What the...

650
00:59:57,792 --> 00:59:58,751
Nice shot.

651
00:59:58,834 --> 01:00:00,920
Put on the handcuffs yourself.

652
01:00:01,003 --> 01:00:02,004
Okay, let's go!

653
01:00:02,088 --> 01:00:04,382
Hey, I really didn't kill that person.
Stop! Wait! Don't go!

654
01:00:09,053 --> 01:00:10,638
The Forensics team
is going to arrive in 20 minutes.

655
01:00:10,721 --> 01:00:12,223
Oh, why can't they come any faster?

656
01:00:12,306 --> 01:00:14,558
You said it was just a plain
illegal gambling website case.

657
01:00:14,642 --> 01:00:16,477
Are we going to have to work
overtime again?

658
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,145
I can't work overtime.

659
01:00:18,229 --> 01:00:19,230
I'm serious.

660
01:00:19,313 --> 01:00:20,606
I'm totally serious right now.

661
01:00:20,856 --> 01:00:24,110
-I can't do it until we get a new member.
-I can't do it either. Damn it.

662
01:00:24,193 --> 01:00:25,528
When are we getting a new recruit?

663
01:00:25,611 --> 01:00:27,571
I want to hire one too.
I think about it every day.

664
01:00:27,655 --> 01:00:30,825
But I have no choice. Nobody wants to join
the Violent Crimes Division these days.

665
01:00:30,908 --> 01:00:32,410
You don't get promoted easily,
you don't get paid well,

666
01:00:32,493 --> 01:00:34,370
you get hurt all the time,
you get disciplined for everything...

667
01:00:34,453 --> 01:00:35,830
Would you apply if it were you?

668
01:00:35,913 --> 01:00:37,123
But we're doing this job.

669
01:00:37,373 --> 01:00:38,374
That's right!

670
01:00:40,251 --> 01:00:42,253
But what's with your outfit today?

671
01:00:42,711 --> 01:00:44,130
What? What about it?

672
01:00:45,506 --> 01:00:47,049
I'm a chic, city girl.

673
01:00:47,133 --> 01:00:48,717
This is a natural style.

674
01:00:49,552 --> 01:00:51,929
But did you call me "ma'am" a while ago?

675
01:00:52,012 --> 01:00:53,514
Anyone would have called you that.

676
01:00:59,061 --> 01:00:59,979
He's right.

677
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:34,763
Tell Captain Jo that I'm going to check

678
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,474
whether it's a clock or a rabbit first.

679
01:01:41,061 --> 01:01:43,606
Team One and Two,
put on the harnesses and stand by.

680
01:01:43,689 --> 01:01:45,483
Where are you right now, Captain?

681
01:02:06,462 --> 01:02:08,130
<i>We got the identity of the body.</i>

682
01:02:08,714 --> 01:02:10,966
Lee Sang-do, age 45,
a hardware store owner.

683
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:13,636
He was a member of Kim Bok-man's
gambling website.

684
01:02:13,719 --> 01:02:15,721
He took money worth a whole building
from that site.

685
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:19,767
<i>But he put the store up for sale
and we can't get a hold of his wife.</i>

686
01:02:19,892 --> 01:02:22,061
<i>I'll head back after investigating
around here some more.</i>

687
01:02:22,144 --> 01:02:24,730
Okay, I'm getting the security footage.
We'll discuss things at the station.

688
01:02:26,482 --> 01:02:28,275
I want to check the security footage.

689
01:02:29,777 --> 01:02:31,987
The VIP just passed Point 06. Over.

690
01:02:32,571 --> 01:02:33,531
We're at Point 04.

691
01:02:33,614 --> 01:02:35,199
Report at each point. Over.

692
01:02:51,006 --> 01:02:51,840
What is it?

693
01:02:53,133 --> 01:02:54,134
What's wrong, Maximus?

694
01:05:30,207 --> 01:05:31,083
What was that?

695
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:34,211
Damn it. That startled me.

696
01:05:36,922 --> 01:05:37,923
That's so scary.

697
01:05:43,345 --> 01:05:45,264
I guess I'm really getting old.

698
01:05:46,056 --> 01:05:47,558
How could I hallucinate like that?

699
01:05:50,227 --> 01:05:51,770
Gosh, my heart hurts.

700
01:05:59,486 --> 01:06:01,196
What the hell is that?

701
01:06:02,156 --> 01:06:03,115
What a weirdo.

702
01:06:03,198 --> 01:06:04,491
Hey, there's a horse.

703
01:06:04,575 --> 01:06:05,951
It's huge.

704
01:06:06,034 --> 01:06:08,203
What's a white horse doing on the road?

705
01:06:08,787 --> 01:06:11,415
You, the man on the horse,
stop right there.

706
01:06:13,167 --> 01:06:15,544
Horse, horse-rider...

707
01:06:15,627 --> 01:06:17,004
Excuse me, horse-rider.

708
01:06:17,463 --> 01:06:20,174
Park your horse
on the side road to the right.

709
01:06:20,257 --> 01:06:22,134
-Do you see that?
-What's that?

710
01:06:22,217 --> 01:06:24,595
-He is so handsome.
-Park your horse right now.

711
01:06:26,472 --> 01:06:27,848
He's not listening at all.

712
01:06:37,232 --> 01:06:38,358
Maybe it's for a film.

713
01:06:38,442 --> 01:06:39,568
He's really handsome.

01:07:11,558 --> 01:07:13,894
Excuse me, sir! The man on the horse!

718
01:07:50,097 --> 01:07:52,808
You shouldn't
disturb the traffic like this.

719
01:07:53,475 --> 01:07:54,351
Get down.

720
01:07:56,228 --> 01:07:59,690
Where did a civilian
get a white horse like that?

721
01:08:02,568 --> 01:08:04,736
You've violated the road traffic law.

722
01:08:07,072 --> 01:08:10,534
And you'll be given a heavier penalty
if that horse poops on the ground.

723
01:08:14,955 --> 01:08:16,707
Why are you staring at me like that?

724
01:08:18,625 --> 01:08:19,626
Oh, I see.

725
01:08:22,087 --> 01:08:24,506
I'm a police officer. Get down from there.

726
01:08:25,966 --> 01:08:27,718
And show me your identification card.

What the hell

729
01:09:07,132 --> 01:09:08,800
do you think you're doing right now?

730
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:11,136
I've

731
01:09:14,348 --> 01:09:15,641
finally met you,

732
01:09:18,101 --> 01:09:19,227
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

<i>What are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?</i>

735
01:10:43,145 --> 01:10:44,730
I am the King of the Kingdom of Corea.

736
01:10:44,813 --> 01:10:46,982
<i>I came to a conclusion
that this is a parallel universe.</i>

737
01:10:47,065 --> 01:10:48,483
This is a parallel universe?

738
01:10:48,984 --> 01:10:52,154
<i>I heard Tae-eul got herself into
a difficult situation with a handsome guy.</i>

739
01:10:52,237 --> 01:10:53,196
Kim Gae-ddong!

740
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,407
His Majesty was after whom? A woman?

741
01:10:55,490 --> 01:10:56,783
<i>Did you find the woman they were chasing?</i>

742
01:10:56,867 --> 01:10:58,869
-Yeong. Isn't that you, Yeong?
-What's your problem?

743
01:10:58,952 --> 01:11:00,037
I heard you're unidentified.

744
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,788
What exactly is the relationship
between you and Lieutenant Jeong?

745
01:11:01,872 --> 01:11:03,040
<i>Container ship?</i>

746
01:11:03,123 --> 01:11:04,291
<i>I can't stay here for long.</i>

747
01:11:04,374 --> 01:11:06,835
<i>The reason why
I have to stay in your world.</i>

748
01:11:06,918 --> 01:11:07,919
<i>Could there be a reason?</i>

749
01:11:08,003 --> 01:11:10,130
<i>I like being here with you like this.</i>

750
01:11:10,213 --> 01:11:12,632
But I don't know you. Why do you know me?

751
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:14,301
<i>Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.</i>

752
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:16,011
I take you...
