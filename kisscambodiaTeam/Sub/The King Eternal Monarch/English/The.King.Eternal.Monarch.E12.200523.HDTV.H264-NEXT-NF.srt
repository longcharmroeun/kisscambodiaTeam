THE KING: ETERNAL MONARCH

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,003
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:08,086 --> 00:00:09,922
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:13,842 --> 00:00:14,843
Oh, man.

5
00:00:15,427 --> 00:00:17,012
EPISODE 12

6
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:22,601
Are you all right?

7
00:00:22,684 --> 00:00:24,186
Yes, I'm fine.

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,064
I thought I just saw something.

9
00:00:31,985 --> 00:00:33,028
Let go!

10
00:00:33,278 --> 00:00:35,447
Let go of me, you jerk!

11
00:00:35,906 --> 00:00:37,157
Let me go!

12
00:00:55,258 --> 00:00:56,093
Get some sleep.

13
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,470
You'll be treated by the time you wake up.

14
00:01:05,018 --> 00:01:06,812
You really are incredible.

15
00:01:08,146 --> 00:01:09,439
You kill the living,

16
00:01:10,148 --> 00:01:12,275
but you keep me alive
every time I try to die.

17
00:01:13,276 --> 00:01:14,111
I guess

18
00:01:15,654 --> 00:01:17,322
you'll really become God.

19
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,342
I'll take care of the rest.
Let her go now.

20
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:38,385
Hang this up.

21
00:01:39,803 --> 00:01:41,054
I guess that cabinet will do.

22
00:01:48,562 --> 00:01:50,731
Where is Mr. Yu when we need him?

23
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,316
He quit.

24
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,693
There's a new manager now.

25
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:56,695
She's Ms. Baek.

26
00:01:59,197 --> 00:02:00,574
-A déjà vu?
-Yes.

27
00:02:01,283 --> 00:02:02,617
A déjà vu actually occurs

28
00:02:02,701 --> 00:02:04,619
when your frequency matches
that of another world

29
00:02:04,703 --> 00:02:07,122
and you get a glimpse
of yourself in that world.

30
00:02:07,247 --> 00:02:09,332
You know that I used to be
in the radio club, right?

31
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,419
But why are you mentioning that right now?

32
00:02:12,502 --> 00:02:13,962
I saw myself just now.

33
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:17,924
But I was with someone
who looks exactly like you.

34
00:02:18,842 --> 00:02:20,719
My doppelganger had short hair,

35
00:02:20,802 --> 00:02:22,763
and your doppelganger was
in a hospital gown.

36
00:02:25,223 --> 00:02:26,058
A hospital gown?

37
00:02:37,527 --> 00:02:38,987
Na-ri!

38
00:02:41,907 --> 00:02:43,825
Right, you're injured.

39
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:46,161
So I guess you could be
delirious from a fever.

40
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:57,255
And this has happened twice already,
so I have to ask.

41
00:02:58,131 --> 00:02:59,299
Who is Na-ri?

42
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:01,885
Why do people keep calling me Na-ri?

43
00:03:02,886 --> 00:03:04,679
<i>Myeong Seung-a, a newcomer
at the Royal Public Affairs Office.</i>

44
00:03:04,846 --> 00:03:07,349
<i>We talk formally, and she's good
at her work and with words.</i>

45
00:03:09,309 --> 00:03:10,268
I meant ordinary,

46
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:12,312
not Na-ri.

47
00:03:12,562 --> 00:03:14,606
I meant that I want to get better

48
00:03:14,856 --> 00:03:16,399
and go back to my ordinary life.

49
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,528
Should I tell you how someone
who's a bad liar like you

50
00:03:19,653 --> 00:03:21,863
can get out of a situation like this?

51
00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:24,491
It's finally time

52
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,035
for you to ask for my number.

53
00:03:28,787 --> 00:03:29,663
It's 010...

54
00:03:29,746 --> 00:03:30,664
So it was you.

55
00:03:31,581 --> 00:03:33,333
The person he was talking about.

56
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:34,459
She has pretty eyes.

57
00:03:36,795 --> 00:03:37,921
Excuse me?

58
00:03:41,842 --> 00:03:42,801
Hey, newbie.

59
00:03:43,593 --> 00:03:44,761
Take good care of your number.

60
00:03:45,387 --> 00:03:46,930
Don't give it out to other guys.

61
00:04:00,193 --> 00:04:02,779
Damn, I thought I was going to get caught.

62
00:04:07,325 --> 00:04:09,744
She looks exactly like Na-ri. Wow.

63
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:13,415
Even across different worlds,
she's still so pretty...

64
00:04:19,212 --> 00:04:20,213
Na-ri...

65
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:22,716
How are you...

66
00:04:26,678 --> 00:04:28,221
Na-ri, Na-ri...

67
00:04:30,098 --> 00:04:31,057
Jo Eun-sup...

68
00:04:31,725 --> 00:04:33,310
He seems a bit strange these days.

69
00:04:34,895 --> 00:04:37,272
Does he have another weird dream?

70
00:04:43,153 --> 00:04:44,029
Hello, welcome.

71
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:50,202
Can I see your menu?
This is my first time here.

72
00:04:50,368 --> 00:04:51,411
Here you go.

73
00:04:53,496 --> 00:04:54,581
What's this?

74
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,918
It's the most popular milk tea we have.

75
00:04:58,126 --> 00:05:01,588
There are chewy tapioca pearls
and soft pudding inside.

76
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:04,633
It sounds like a foreign language.

77
00:05:05,383 --> 00:05:07,761
But it sounds interesting.
I'll have that to go.

78
00:05:09,471 --> 00:05:10,764
It's 5,800 won.

79
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:14,267
Here.

80
00:05:15,852 --> 00:05:17,145
Please wait a moment.

81
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:21,191
Hey, you're here. Hang on.

82
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:32,869
Eun-bi and Kka-bi aren't here yet.

83
00:05:32,953 --> 00:05:34,162
Why did you come so early?

84
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:40,627
I want my <i>japchae</i>!

85
00:05:42,462 --> 00:05:44,673
What are you talking about?

86
00:05:45,465 --> 00:05:49,261
You told me to come get some <i>japchae</i>.
You said you'd give me some. Come on.

87
00:05:50,971 --> 00:05:52,097
Here's your drink.

88
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:54,516
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:55,058 --> 00:05:56,685
We're childhood friends.

90
00:05:57,394 --> 00:05:58,228
I see.

91
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:07,404
It's good.

92
00:06:07,904 --> 00:06:08,947
Come back again next time.

93
00:06:11,283 --> 00:06:13,410
Can't you see I have a customer?

94
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:16,621
And why did you cut your hair so short?

95
00:06:16,871 --> 00:06:18,832
Na-ri, let me borrow your car.
The one out there.

96
00:06:19,332 --> 00:06:21,042
Nonsense. You don't even have a license.

97
00:06:22,627 --> 00:06:24,212
DRIVER'S LICENSE
JO EUN-SUP

98
00:06:37,058 --> 00:06:39,769
The car escorting the VIP
just passed the Naegok-dong intersection.

99
00:06:39,853 --> 00:06:42,314
<i>It's heading for
the National Security Agency.</i>

100
00:06:47,777 --> 00:06:50,196
<i>Hang in there, Lieutenant Jeong.</i>

101
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,408
<i>I'm coming for you.</i>

102
00:06:54,617 --> 00:06:55,744
<i>I promise</i>

103
00:06:56,911 --> 00:06:57,996
<i>I will find you.</i>

104
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:02,876
I want you all

105
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,338
to use big data to find the person
in this photo.

106
00:07:07,172 --> 00:07:08,715
It's very urgent.

107
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:10,633
This isn't an order,

108
00:07:11,968 --> 00:07:13,136
but a request.

109
00:07:13,636 --> 00:07:15,180
-Yes, Your Majesty!
-Yes, Your Majesty!

110
00:07:15,972 --> 00:07:17,640
Could I have the data, Your Majesty?

111
00:07:17,724 --> 00:07:19,934
It's a photo of a security footage,

112
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,519
so it's not very clear.

113
00:07:22,145 --> 00:07:23,021
Could it still work?

114
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:25,482
Yes, it's possible.

115
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:28,401
But since we don't have
the exact location of the target,

116
00:07:29,027 --> 00:07:30,195
it may take some time.

117
00:07:30,278 --> 00:07:31,488
I understand.

118
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:13,279
Your Majesty, there's a call for you.

119
00:08:17,826 --> 00:08:18,910
Yes, Yeong.

120
00:08:19,202 --> 00:08:22,247
<i>Sir, Detective Kang called again.</i>

121
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,666
<i>He said something about finding
Luna or whatever.</i>

122
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:27,502
<i>They were chasing her
and causing a huge racket.</i>

123
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:30,213
Tell him to call me right now.

124
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:32,382
And keep your voice low.

125
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,849
Is there a quiet room and a laptop
I could use?

126
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:43,685
I'll have them ready right away.

127
00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:35,361
I checked the video.

128
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,363
It's near the Busan palace.

129
00:09:37,947 --> 00:09:40,492
<i>Yes. If you look at the 15th second
in the third file,</i>

130
00:09:40,992 --> 00:09:42,243
<i>you can tell it's Luna for sure.</i>

131
00:09:42,744 --> 00:09:44,496
She's not the one you've been looking for,

132
00:09:45,788 --> 00:09:46,623
but thank you.

133
00:09:46,706 --> 00:09:47,749
<i>Right...</i>

134
00:09:47,832 --> 00:09:48,708
<i>What?</i>

135
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,043
Take care, then.

136
00:09:50,293 --> 00:09:51,628
I'll thank you in person later.

137
00:09:54,672 --> 00:09:56,216
I got info on the target's attire.

138
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:58,676
A grey hoodie, training pants,
and white sneakers.

139
00:09:58,885 --> 00:10:00,762
She probably has
her hair tied in a ponytail.

140
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,682
Check the routes from the Eastern Market
to the main palace.

141
00:10:31,751 --> 00:10:32,877
TAE-EUL

142
00:10:32,961 --> 00:10:34,420
SIN-JAE

143
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:38,091
<i>Jo Eun-sup?</i>

144
00:10:38,174 --> 00:10:40,718
It's Jo Yeong.
Detective Jeong isn't picking up.

145
00:10:41,594 --> 00:10:43,846
Please come to Yeouido. I need your help.

146
00:10:44,472 --> 00:10:45,848
<i>Do you have Eun-sup's phone, too?</i>

147
00:10:46,516 --> 00:10:47,600
<i>What's going on?</i>

148
00:10:47,684 --> 00:10:49,352
<i>You're going to have to owe me, though.</i>

149
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,645
I'll be waiting.

150
00:11:03,157 --> 00:11:04,284
Go on

151
00:11:04,993 --> 00:11:06,286
and get some rest.

152
00:11:06,995 --> 00:11:08,162
You've done a good job today.

153
00:11:08,955 --> 00:11:09,998
It's nothing.

154
00:11:28,182 --> 00:11:29,475
Did you find out?

155
00:11:31,144 --> 00:11:34,105
I hope it's news
that will put me back on my feet.

156
00:11:34,772 --> 00:11:37,817
I checked the alibis of the court workers
who changed their shifts.

157
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,029
And there was nothing in particular about
Lee Gi-yun, Yun Do-gyeong, and Kim Su-a.

158
00:11:42,905 --> 00:11:43,740
So

159
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,618
there was something about Park Suk-jin?

160
00:11:48,911 --> 00:11:52,915
<i>She only went out twice recently
to a bookstore in the slums.</i>

161
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:54,709
And the days she left

162
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:57,712
were when His Majesty's
schedule was empty.

163
00:11:58,379 --> 00:11:59,756
After she left the bookstore,

164
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:03,176
she was burning this.

165
00:12:08,097 --> 00:12:11,684
And the reason I'm reporting
to you today is because

166
00:12:11,893 --> 00:12:14,562
that bookstore was where
the traitor's followers were staying.

167
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,689
What?

168
00:12:17,607 --> 00:12:18,858
How could someone like her

169
00:12:19,567 --> 00:12:21,736
have worked here at the palace?

170
00:12:22,403 --> 00:12:24,572
She was hired as a descendant
of a national contributor,

171
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:26,741
and the contributor was her
grandfather, Park Dong-u.

172
00:12:27,492 --> 00:12:29,744
But she was not his real granddaughter,
Park Suk-jin.

173
00:12:30,328 --> 00:12:32,455
What in the world are you talking about?

174
00:12:32,622 --> 00:12:35,875
The real Park Suk-jin is living in Pyongan
Province under the name of Min Seon-yeong.

175
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,170
And there's a record of Min Seon-yeong
having lost her son a long time ago.

176
00:12:41,673 --> 00:12:42,507
What?

177
00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:44,175
Min Seon-yeong?

178
00:13:28,136 --> 00:13:31,848
I was so thorough
when hiring workers in the palace,

179
00:13:33,057 --> 00:13:34,183
but it was you!

180
00:13:38,104 --> 00:13:39,772
What is your real name?

181
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:45,987
Are you Min Seon-yeong,
who lost a son a long time ago?

182
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,168
Keep your mouths shut!

183
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:02,128
If even a word

184
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:05,339
about this incident leaves the palace,

185
00:14:05,923 --> 00:14:09,844
I will punish you and your family
for three generations!

186
00:14:10,344 --> 00:14:11,888
-Yes, Head Court Lady Noh.
-Yes, Head Court Lady Noh.

187
00:14:16,392 --> 00:14:18,186
And call the palace doctor.

188
00:14:18,811 --> 00:14:21,022
Take her to the secondary palace.

189
00:14:22,565 --> 00:14:24,317
We must keep her alive.

190
00:14:25,943 --> 00:14:28,488
I have to find out and reveal

191
00:14:29,238 --> 00:14:33,159
who tried to keep her mouth shut.

192
00:15:10,488 --> 00:15:11,364
Hey!

193
00:15:12,782 --> 00:15:14,242
Can't you drive properly?

194
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:16,077
I could've died!

195
00:15:19,497 --> 00:15:20,832
You can't die here,

196
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,584
Prime Minister Koo.

197
00:15:25,753 --> 00:15:27,964
Do I look like a government official?

198
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,758
I think you're mistaken.

199
00:15:31,342 --> 00:15:32,468
I don't think I am.

200
00:15:32,552 --> 00:15:34,595
You're mistaking me with someone else.

201
00:15:35,596 --> 00:15:37,390
Why would you mistake me for someone else?

202
00:15:38,474 --> 00:15:39,350
It's dangerous.

203
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:11,007
The police is here!

204
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:14,302
Over here! Someone's hurt! Hurry!

205
00:16:19,265 --> 00:16:20,474
What was that gunshot just now?

206
00:16:21,017 --> 00:16:21,934
Jo Yeong!

207
00:16:22,268 --> 00:16:23,311
Hey, stay with me! Hey!

208
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:30,026
This is just a drill. You can go.

209
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:32,653
He's fine. It's a drill.

210
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,131
Are you sure you don't need a doctor?

211
00:16:52,673 --> 00:16:54,383
The hospitals here are great.

212
00:16:55,217 --> 00:16:57,345
Bullet-proof vests from
the Kingdom of Corea are great.

213
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,514
I don't have any fractures
or organ damages.

214
00:17:00,723 --> 00:17:03,184
I only have a ruptured ligament,
so it's fine.

215
00:17:05,061 --> 00:17:07,730
You don't see a doctor after being shot
where you come from?

216
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,900
I got rid of the dashcam footage.

217
00:17:10,983 --> 00:17:12,401
Give that back to Na-ri.

218
00:17:15,571 --> 00:17:17,114
And be honest now.

219
00:17:18,366 --> 00:17:20,618
What kind of country is it
to have shootouts like that?

220
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:23,829
Just give me anything.
Even an excuse will do.

221
00:17:23,913 --> 00:17:25,456
Or you'll be the first to be arrested.

222
00:17:26,832 --> 00:17:28,376
It won't happen again.

223
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:30,670
I'll explain everything
when His Majesty returns.

224
00:17:31,963 --> 00:17:33,339
And when's he coming back?

225
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:38,260
That's no way to treat your savior.

226
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:41,889
I can't use my hand. Can you open the lid?

227
00:17:43,474 --> 00:17:46,018
You can get beheaded for referring
to the King like that.

228
00:17:53,025 --> 00:17:54,652
He's your King, not mine.

229
00:18:01,867 --> 00:18:03,035
Don't you remember?

230
00:18:03,828 --> 00:18:05,204
He was your King,

231
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,748
and you saw him crying.

232
00:18:15,381 --> 00:18:16,716
How long have you been his guard?

233
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,260
Since I was four.

234
00:18:21,595 --> 00:18:22,471
Don't be ridiculous.

235
00:18:27,268 --> 00:18:30,855
From now on, you're the Unbreakable Sword.

236
00:18:32,064 --> 00:18:33,399
He was eight,

237
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,109
and I was four.

238
00:18:36,944 --> 00:18:38,863
<i>I saw His Majesty at his coronation.</i>

239
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,494
That's when I thought

240
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:49,081
that I wanted him to be happy.

241
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,376
I think it was fate.

242
00:18:57,506 --> 00:19:00,593
I don't know what to say.
It's such a different world from mine.

243
00:19:01,761 --> 00:19:02,636
Are you two dating?

244
00:19:04,972 --> 00:19:06,724
Rumors like that do exist.

245
00:19:08,225 --> 00:19:12,480
But it's the same
for you and Lieutenant Jeong.

246
00:19:12,855 --> 00:19:14,732
You protect the law and justice
with your lives.

247
00:19:16,025 --> 00:19:17,443
For me, that's His Majesty.

248
00:19:21,572 --> 00:19:23,074
By the way, why was he crying then?

249
00:19:29,288 --> 00:19:30,956
It was his first duty as the King.

250
00:19:32,374 --> 00:19:34,085
The funeral of the former King.

251
00:19:36,378 --> 00:19:37,505
So he doesn't have a father?

252
00:19:38,255 --> 00:19:39,173
What happened?

253
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:41,050
He was killed by his brother.

254
00:19:42,802 --> 00:19:44,804
And His Majesty saw it all.

255
00:19:46,263 --> 00:19:48,015
So since then,

256
00:19:50,684 --> 00:19:53,646
he has been sleeping
with the thought of death.

257
00:20:08,285 --> 00:20:09,161
Protect her!

258
00:20:09,662 --> 00:20:11,580
She is the future queen
of the Kingdom of Corea.

259
00:20:11,705 --> 00:20:13,874
<i>So the palace is the safest home for him,</i>

260
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:16,961
<i>and the most dangerous
battlefield as well.</i>

261
00:20:18,838 --> 00:20:22,049
<i>But now it seems like
he has enetered a new battlefield.</i>

262
00:20:23,676 --> 00:20:25,177
<i>If that is his destiny,</i>

263
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,139
<i>I must follow him,</i>

264
00:20:30,349 --> 00:20:31,809
<i>whatever that battlefield may be.</i>

265
00:22:06,487 --> 00:22:09,448
Let me skip the thanks.

266
00:22:11,784 --> 00:22:13,244
You're skipping so much.

267
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:18,624
I missed you.

268
00:22:21,168 --> 00:22:22,419
I missed you.

269
00:22:25,881 --> 00:22:27,132
I missed you.

270
00:22:35,641 --> 00:22:36,767
And the gun.

271
00:22:37,893 --> 00:22:39,311
There are two bullets left.

272
00:22:53,117 --> 00:22:54,785
Let's go to the palace.

273
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:01,709
Jeong Tae-eul.

274
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:07,756
Sub-captain Seok.

275
00:23:08,173 --> 00:23:09,925
Take care of things here, and Maximus too.

276
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:11,218
Yes, Your Majesty!

277
00:23:36,285 --> 00:23:37,161
Your Majesty!

278
00:23:38,746 --> 00:23:41,540
Dr. Hwang is here,
and I have a guest room ready.

279
00:23:41,665 --> 00:23:43,542
No, I'm taking her to my chambers.

280
00:23:46,462 --> 00:23:48,839
Bring Dr. Hwang to the King's chambers
right now.

281
00:24:22,956 --> 00:24:23,832
Your Majesty!

282
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:25,250
What happened?

283
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:28,754
Blood! My goodness.

284
00:24:31,215 --> 00:24:32,466
It's not my blood.

285
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:33,384
What?

286
00:24:35,886 --> 00:24:36,887
Are you all right?

287
00:24:42,684 --> 00:24:46,480
Every woman I like is unwell.

288
00:25:50,043 --> 00:25:51,170
My goodness.

289
00:25:52,212 --> 00:25:54,756
Were you here the whole time?

290
00:25:55,549 --> 00:25:57,217
You should've just come inside.

291
00:25:58,927 --> 00:26:00,220
You told me to leave.

292
00:26:02,639 --> 00:26:04,349
I've treated her wounds,

293
00:26:04,975 --> 00:26:07,144
and she'll soon recover from dehydration.

294
00:26:09,146 --> 00:26:11,899
She just fell asleep.
Why don't you go inside?

295
00:26:12,483 --> 00:26:15,986
I should go and get Dr. Hwang
something to eat.

296
00:26:20,407 --> 00:26:21,283
Thank you.

297
00:26:23,619 --> 00:26:24,661
Thank you for your work.

298
00:26:28,373 --> 00:26:30,709
This way, Dr. Hwang.

299
00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:33,670
Oh, my head.

300
00:27:40,779 --> 00:27:41,655
Get some more sleep.

301
00:27:44,866 --> 00:27:45,951
Why are you making me sleep

302
00:27:47,661 --> 00:27:49,454
when I've met you again at last?

303
00:27:54,376 --> 00:27:56,336
I look awful, don't I?

304
00:27:58,338 --> 00:27:59,172
Not at all.

305
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:03,010
You look like a huge bandage right now.

306
00:28:03,468 --> 00:28:06,138
But you're a really pretty bandage.

307
00:28:09,308 --> 00:28:10,350
But

308
00:28:11,852 --> 00:28:13,478
how did you find me, though?

309
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,482
I told you I'm a decent person here.

310
00:28:21,945 --> 00:28:25,782
I drank water at the Taekwondo center

311
00:28:27,367 --> 00:28:28,785
and lost consciousness.

312
00:28:32,205 --> 00:28:34,666
Now I know how important it is
to have food tasted beforehand.

313
00:28:38,295 --> 00:28:39,630
You can tell me about it later.

314
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:44,635
You can tell me when you're all better.

315
00:28:47,596 --> 00:28:50,223
I thought it would've been
our last moment together.

316
00:28:52,976 --> 00:28:54,478
That time in the bamboo forest.

317
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,154
Lots of things

318
00:29:07,032 --> 00:29:08,659
happened while we were apart.

319
00:29:10,202 --> 00:29:11,411
That's why I couldn't go back.

320
00:29:15,123 --> 00:29:16,166
That's a relief.

321
00:29:19,169 --> 00:29:21,213
I thought that door had closed.

322
00:29:22,214 --> 00:29:23,173
Don't worry.

323
00:29:24,966 --> 00:29:26,259
If that door closes,

324
00:29:27,761 --> 00:29:29,304
I'll open all the doors in the universe.

325
00:29:30,222 --> 00:29:31,098
And

326
00:29:33,016 --> 00:29:34,393
I'll come to you.

327
00:29:38,355 --> 00:29:39,272
You have to.

328
00:29:43,443 --> 00:29:44,444
But

329
00:29:45,404 --> 00:29:46,446
what about Eun-sup?

330
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:50,909
Well...

331
00:29:54,037 --> 00:29:55,539
He's in the hospital.

332
00:29:56,248 --> 00:29:57,416
He's all right, though.

333
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,210
It was one of the many things
that happened here.

334
00:30:02,713 --> 00:30:03,922
I see.

335
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,551
When I wake up later,

336
00:30:10,095 --> 00:30:12,472
let's go and see Eun-sup first.

337
00:30:14,307 --> 00:30:15,392
I miss him.

338
00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:18,270
Are you saying you miss another guy
in front of me?

339
00:30:21,356 --> 00:30:23,191
Jo Yeong is doing all right, too.

340
00:30:26,403 --> 00:30:27,320
Yeong...

341
00:30:29,281 --> 00:30:30,699
I like you more than Yeong, though.

342
00:30:30,782 --> 00:30:32,325
Liar.

343
00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:33,952
Sorry.

344
00:30:36,788 --> 00:30:37,831
It hurts.

345
00:30:41,126 --> 00:30:41,960
What?

346
00:30:42,794 --> 00:30:43,628
"Sorry"?

347
00:30:44,337 --> 00:30:45,297
You opened your eyes.

348
00:30:49,509 --> 00:30:51,178
I wanted to see your eyes again.

349
00:30:53,555 --> 00:30:54,806
Get out.

350
00:30:54,931 --> 00:30:56,016
This is my room.

351
00:30:56,099 --> 00:30:57,350
Oh, really?

352
00:30:58,935 --> 00:31:00,937
Then I should take a look around tomorrow.

353
00:31:03,148 --> 00:31:06,193
I hope there's a lot of jewelry here.

354
00:31:59,923 --> 00:32:01,133
JINSUN PARTY

355
00:32:03,718 --> 00:32:06,346
His Majesty just caused a huge commotion.

356
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,933
It was shocking enough that he caught
the traitor's followers himself,

357
00:32:10,016 --> 00:32:11,101
but announcing the queen?

358
00:32:11,351 --> 00:32:13,437
Nobody would've ever imagined
such things happening.

359
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,897
Announcing the queen
after so much blood was shed...

360
00:32:16,523 --> 00:32:19,025
That's a very symbolic show of action.

361
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,988
We must find out
what kind of family that woman is from.

362
00:32:23,071 --> 00:32:25,907
By the way, how long is Prime Minister Koo
going to stay cooped up?

363
00:32:25,991 --> 00:32:28,994
The King announced the Queen,
and her approval ratings are falling.

364
00:32:29,286 --> 00:32:31,830
All her efforts went to waste,
so it's natural for her to fall ill.

365
00:32:31,913 --> 00:32:33,999
It'll be a pain in the neck
if an outsider gains power.

366
00:32:34,624 --> 00:32:37,419
Even a prime minister from a fish shop
was a pain in the neck.

367
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:41,923
All right. We have to find out her age,
alma mater, family, job, anything.

368
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:43,133
Move!

369
00:33:06,615 --> 00:33:09,868
CALL HISTORY

370
00:34:10,595 --> 00:34:13,598
HOW TO RAISE A MAGIC LILY

371
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,396
JANGMI

372
00:34:22,691 --> 00:34:24,776
<i>Chief, what should I order for everyone?</i>

373
00:34:25,527 --> 00:34:26,945
<i>I had a homemade meal.</i>

374
00:34:27,529 --> 00:34:28,738
<i>I had ox knee soup.</i>

375
00:34:29,281 --> 00:34:30,365
<i>What about the other two?</i>

376
00:34:31,908 --> 00:34:35,036
<i>One of you two read my message.
Can't you at least send a reply?</i>

377
00:34:35,161 --> 00:34:36,580
<i>An exclamation mark is fine too.</i>

378
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:39,958
<i>I'll accept question marks too.</i>

379
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,503
<i>Crying face...</i>

380
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,464
Oh, Mr. Kang, you're here.

381
00:34:47,048 --> 00:34:49,384
Did you get my message?
I'm trying to order food.

382
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:50,552
You can eat first.

383
00:34:50,844 --> 00:34:52,178
What about Tae-eul?

384
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:53,346
What?

385
00:34:57,851 --> 00:34:58,810
You don't know, either?

386
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:00,687
Tae-eul took a vacation.

387
00:35:01,271 --> 00:35:02,314
What? A vacation?

388
00:35:02,606 --> 00:35:05,150
Yes. She used all 21 days.

389
00:35:06,192 --> 00:35:09,237
Why are you taking turns doing this to me?

390
00:35:10,697 --> 00:35:12,991
-Hey. Your wild ideas...
-<i>I'm getting some fresh air.</i>

391
00:35:13,074 --> 00:35:13,992
<i>Don't worry.</i>

392
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,785
and your anxious eyes

393
00:35:16,536 --> 00:35:18,204
are driving me crazy.

394
00:35:18,955 --> 00:35:20,457
-This won't do.
-What should I do?

395
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,000
We need to go out for drinks tonight.

396
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:24,252
We can go singing later.
It'll be all right.

397
00:35:24,419 --> 00:35:26,463
-<i>Where are you? Answer my call.</i>
-We should all go.

398
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,732
You've taken in enough fluids
so I was removing your IV.

399
00:35:48,068 --> 00:35:48,985
Right.

400
00:35:49,444 --> 00:35:50,278
Thank you.

401
00:35:58,286 --> 00:35:59,287
Nice to see you again.

402
00:35:59,871 --> 00:36:00,705
Right.

403
00:36:02,499 --> 00:36:05,168
His Majesty ordered me to
escort you once you wake up.

404
00:36:05,835 --> 00:36:07,921
Oh, right. Thank you.

405
00:36:08,922 --> 00:36:10,298
Where is he right now?

406
00:36:23,061 --> 00:36:24,604
Is there something going on?

407
00:36:25,313 --> 00:36:26,272
Well...

408
00:36:26,648 --> 00:36:27,524
His Majesty

409
00:36:28,024 --> 00:36:30,318
is washing rice in his navy uniform.

410
00:36:31,027 --> 00:36:31,945
What?

411
00:36:43,373 --> 00:36:45,667
You're awake. You should've come earlier.

412
00:36:46,251 --> 00:36:48,336
I washed a whole bag of rice.

413
00:36:56,386 --> 00:36:57,554
Where are you going?

414
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:01,141
I've been doing this for you to see.
You can't just leave.

415
00:37:02,308 --> 00:37:03,393
Don't leave!

416
00:37:05,854 --> 00:37:07,230
I can't feel my fingers right now.

417
00:37:09,482 --> 00:37:10,567
Hey.

418
00:37:12,402 --> 00:37:14,904
-All right. Hurry it up then.
-What are we to do?

419
00:37:41,598 --> 00:37:43,016
You said you'll only live for today.

420
00:37:43,683 --> 00:37:46,895
I wanted you to laugh,
although I laughed more than you.

421
00:37:47,937 --> 00:37:49,939
I couldn't leave because I was hungry.

422
00:37:50,565 --> 00:37:52,066
How can you be so dramatic?

423
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,694
That's why I make such a great king.

424
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,157
If I take the MBTI personality test,
my type would be "the King."

425
00:37:59,741 --> 00:38:02,744
Didn't I tell you I'm easily
irritated before meals?

426
00:38:03,328 --> 00:38:04,996
All right. Enjoy your meal.

427
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:12,337
But it might not have been me.

428
00:38:13,254 --> 00:38:15,924
What would you have done
if it was the other me?

429
00:38:21,513 --> 00:38:22,388
I'm...

430
00:38:23,598 --> 00:38:26,643
dating someone in another world.

431
00:38:27,894 --> 00:38:30,355
And she always ties her hair
when something important comes up.

432
00:38:31,648 --> 00:38:33,441
But she always leaves out some strands.

433
00:38:34,275 --> 00:38:36,945
And she doesn't know it
because she can't see it herself.

434
00:38:39,781 --> 00:38:40,657
And?

435
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:43,868
She prefers beer to tea
when having a conversation.

436
00:38:44,494 --> 00:38:45,954
And she likes to mix drinks.

437
00:38:46,371 --> 00:38:47,997
She takes mixing drinks seriously.

438
00:38:48,164 --> 00:38:50,583
She shakes the glass excitedly,
and drinks it quickly.

439
00:38:53,044 --> 00:38:53,878
But

440
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,256
when courage is needed,

441
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,132
she becomes a warrior.

442
00:38:59,759 --> 00:39:01,094
That's the kind of person she is.

443
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:08,518
Let's go see Eun-sup when I'm done eating.

444
00:39:10,854 --> 00:39:13,481
But one big flaw is that
she only says what she wants to say

445
00:39:13,898 --> 00:39:16,150
whether I make her food
or express my love for her.

446
00:39:17,986 --> 00:39:19,571
Where did you put my clothes?

447
00:39:20,154 --> 00:39:21,823
They weren't in the room.
Did you wash them?

448
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,750
I got clothes that match
the styles you usually wear.

449
00:39:33,293 --> 00:39:34,252
Wear anything you want.

450
00:39:34,752 --> 00:39:36,796
Why did you only get styles
I usually wear?

451
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,381
You could get different styles, too.

452
00:39:39,007 --> 00:39:40,341
Don't you have any dresses?

453
00:39:41,175 --> 00:39:42,260
The dresses are over there.

454
00:39:52,604 --> 00:39:53,730
I was just kidding.

455
00:40:04,449 --> 00:40:05,700
I'll wear this.

456
00:40:05,783 --> 00:40:07,577
I knew you'd say that so I was showing off

457
00:40:07,911 --> 00:40:09,078
all the pretty dresses I have.

458
00:40:29,933 --> 00:40:32,560
What's that?

459
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,730
When do you wear that?

460
00:40:37,857 --> 00:40:39,567
At the most glorious moment.

461
00:40:41,235 --> 00:40:45,823
For example, when I'm holding
flowers in my hand?

462
00:40:46,407 --> 00:40:47,450
What flowers do you like?

463
00:40:51,412 --> 00:40:52,497
I just remembered

464
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:56,960
that I never even gave you flowers before.

465
00:40:58,336 --> 00:40:59,253
So

466
00:41:01,673 --> 00:41:03,257
I crossed the universe to give you this.

467
00:41:05,885 --> 00:41:07,053
I don't like flowers.

468
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,554
Let's go.

469
00:41:09,013 --> 00:41:10,306
I want to see Eun-sup.

470
00:41:14,978 --> 00:41:15,937
Fine.

471
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,272
Escort her to the fitting room.

472
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,566
Yes, Your Majesty.

473
00:41:21,985 --> 00:41:22,986
This way, ma'am.

474
00:41:53,266 --> 00:41:57,520
<i>His Majesty said he'd like it
if you put on every item he's prepared.</i>

475
00:41:57,854 --> 00:41:58,938
<i>All of it.</i>

476
00:42:39,729 --> 00:42:41,522
Didn't you find anything in your clothes?

477
00:42:41,731 --> 00:42:42,857
Like a box.

478
00:42:44,192 --> 00:42:45,526
It's a plum blossom, right?

479
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:47,403
It's really pretty.

480
00:42:48,696 --> 00:42:49,906
It's so pretty

481
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,702
that I want to wear it
on a glorious day, too.

482
00:42:55,745 --> 00:42:57,330
When I don't have any wounds.

483
00:43:00,124 --> 00:43:04,295
But how did you know I'd pick this outfit?

484
00:43:05,797 --> 00:43:06,881
I know everything.

485
00:43:07,715 --> 00:43:09,967
Let's go. Eun-sup will be waiting.

486
00:43:21,687 --> 00:43:22,563
<i>Captain Jo.</i>

487
00:43:22,647 --> 00:43:24,398
His Majesty will arrive soon.

488
00:43:24,774 --> 00:43:26,484
He just took the elevator
on the first floor.

489
00:43:27,068 --> 00:43:28,236
All right.

490
00:43:29,028 --> 00:43:30,113
I'll do the security check.

491
00:43:44,377 --> 00:43:45,920
He did the security check like this.

492
00:43:48,756 --> 00:43:49,674
Eun-sup.

493
00:43:53,136 --> 00:43:53,970
What?

494
00:43:54,929 --> 00:43:56,514
Whose voice is this?

495
00:43:59,225 --> 00:44:00,268
Tae-eul!

496
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:05,314
What's going on? Is this a dream?

497
00:44:05,398 --> 00:44:07,024
Is it really you, Tae-eul?

498
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,027
How have you been?

499
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:11,737
I heard you were really courageous.

500
00:44:12,697 --> 00:44:13,698
Listen carefully, Tae-eul.

501
00:44:14,198 --> 00:44:17,535
Someone was shooting at him,
and I could see the bullet flying.

502
00:44:17,618 --> 00:44:18,953
So my instincts kicked in, and...

503
00:44:20,371 --> 00:44:22,331
Hey, what happened to you, though?

504
00:44:22,415 --> 00:44:23,749
Did that happen before you came?

505
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:25,877
Something came up.

506
00:44:26,502 --> 00:44:28,754
Jo Eun-sup, it looks like
you'll get a big promotion here.

507
00:44:28,838 --> 00:44:30,715
Well, if I just put my mind to it,

508
00:44:30,798 --> 00:44:32,925
getting a top rank position
will be a piece of cake.

509
00:44:34,093 --> 00:44:35,803
What's that? Is that for me?

510
00:44:36,888 --> 00:44:38,431
The roll cake you wanted.

511
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:43,811
I went to the Royal Bakery myself
and got it made just for you.

512
00:44:44,979 --> 00:44:46,480
Wow, you really didn't have to.

513
00:44:48,482 --> 00:44:51,652
All right. Cut me a large piece.

514
00:44:54,113 --> 00:44:55,531
I'm afraid I can't do that.

515
00:44:56,115 --> 00:44:58,117
But I could buy you the entire bakery
if you wanted.

516
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:01,621
Really? You better mean it.
I really respect you, sir.

517
00:45:03,164 --> 00:45:05,875
I accidentally lost my chance
to have a canned peach company last time.

518
00:45:05,958 --> 00:45:07,209
I was so upset because of that.

519
00:45:07,293 --> 00:45:10,046
Then next time,
ask him to open a car door for you.

520
00:45:13,674 --> 00:45:17,178
Wow. Why didn't I think of that?

521
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:21,515
What is this?

522
00:45:21,724 --> 00:45:23,225
How can this taste so luxurious?

523
00:45:23,809 --> 00:45:26,187
Eun-bi and Kka-bi would
stuff their faces if they tried this.

524
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,442
Eun-bi and Kka-bi are eating well,

525
00:45:32,068 --> 00:45:34,654
attending kindergarten well,
and they're bright.

526
00:45:35,905 --> 00:45:38,824
And it seems like Eun-bi
found out Yeong isn't you.

527
00:45:39,867 --> 00:45:42,036
Gosh, I told him to be careful.

528
00:45:43,245 --> 00:45:44,789
Aren't you asking about Na-ri?

529
00:45:45,873 --> 00:45:46,749
Na-ri?

530
00:45:48,918 --> 00:45:49,752
Na-ri?

531
00:45:50,962 --> 00:45:53,714
Oh, well.
I haven't thought about her at all...

532
00:45:54,924 --> 00:45:56,300
-I don't really miss--
-She's not

533
00:45:56,384 --> 00:45:57,969
-getting along with Jo Yeong.
-What?

534
00:45:58,052 --> 00:46:00,137
She says he's not as handsome as before.

535
00:46:02,431 --> 00:46:03,474
I actually told him

536
00:46:04,058 --> 00:46:07,228
that his style wouldn't do.
I knew that would happen.

537
00:46:12,066 --> 00:46:15,194
Sir, can you open
the bathroom door for me?

538
00:46:15,903 --> 00:46:17,697
The spot where I got hit
is suddenly hurting.

539
00:46:20,491 --> 00:46:22,410
This hospital is pretty huge.

540
00:46:25,287 --> 00:46:28,040
What? No, no, no!

541
00:46:28,124 --> 00:46:29,083
What's this?

542
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:31,711
Why are you doing that?

543
00:47:09,206 --> 00:47:10,499
I guess the one who took me here

544
00:47:11,542 --> 00:47:12,543
is Lee Lim.

545
00:47:13,127 --> 00:47:14,462
Do you have any idea why?

546
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:16,672
Did you see

547
00:47:17,423 --> 00:47:19,175
the umbrella that he was holding?

548
00:47:20,843 --> 00:47:21,886
The umbrella?

549
00:47:22,887 --> 00:47:25,890
I didn't actually see him.
I only saw his men.

550
00:47:26,474 --> 00:47:27,516
I told you last time

551
00:47:28,476 --> 00:47:31,687
that we each have a piece
of something we both want.

552
00:47:33,064 --> 00:47:35,191
I think he hid it in his umbrella.

553
00:47:39,278 --> 00:47:40,529
And me...

554
00:47:41,572 --> 00:47:42,406
<i>You hid it</i>

555
00:47:43,574 --> 00:47:44,617
<i>in your whip.</i>

556
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,661
He would've realized by now where mine is.

557
00:47:48,788 --> 00:47:51,082
That's why he brought me here.

558
00:47:52,124 --> 00:47:52,958
To make a deal.

559
00:47:53,959 --> 00:47:58,380
So I guess if you lose it,
the door closes on your side.

560
00:47:59,799 --> 00:48:00,633
Yes.

561
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,677
So now the fight is about
who steals the other's piece first?

562
00:48:03,761 --> 00:48:06,222
No. It's about not losing mine.

563
00:48:07,181 --> 00:48:10,518
It's an all-or-nothing fight.

564
00:48:12,103 --> 00:48:13,479
But you'd be at a disadvantage

565
00:48:16,065 --> 00:48:17,650
in this fight.

566
00:48:20,528 --> 00:48:21,695
You'd have to carry that

567
00:48:23,781 --> 00:48:25,407
when you're visiting me.

568
00:48:26,992 --> 00:48:28,369
That's why

569
00:48:29,328 --> 00:48:30,621
you shouldn't treat me harshly.

570
00:48:41,257 --> 00:48:42,341
Don't worry.

571
00:48:43,175 --> 00:48:45,052
I won't lose anything that belongs to me.

572
00:48:46,887 --> 00:48:48,180
But if you're still worried,

573
00:48:49,431 --> 00:48:50,808
why don't we go and pray together?

574
00:48:52,434 --> 00:48:53,435
Let's pray that we'll have

575
00:48:55,521 --> 00:48:56,856
God's blessing as well.

576
00:49:10,703 --> 00:49:12,746
I searched for this place in your world.

577
00:49:13,539 --> 00:49:17,042
This church is the only place
that's the same in both worlds.

578
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:18,586
Really?

579
00:49:19,336 --> 00:49:21,005
Why did you search for this church?

580
00:49:22,464 --> 00:49:25,718
This is where my parents got married.

581
00:49:28,762 --> 00:49:34,268
My father saw my mother lecturing at
a seminar and fell in love at first sight.

582
00:49:34,852 --> 00:49:36,729
It was held by
the World Academy of Sciences.

583
00:49:37,771 --> 00:49:39,690
My mother was a scientist.

584
00:49:41,108 --> 00:49:42,568
So you take after your mother.

585
00:49:43,444 --> 00:49:44,403
Yes.

586
00:49:45,613 --> 00:49:50,492
My father proposed to her,
but my mother was Catholic.

587
00:49:52,578 --> 00:49:53,537
So my father

588
00:49:54,371 --> 00:49:56,248
studied the religion for six months.

589
00:49:57,333 --> 00:50:00,127
He came here every single week.

590
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:02,671
Wow.

591
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:07,718
So they got married and had me.

592
00:50:09,762 --> 00:50:10,804
But my mother

593
00:50:12,014 --> 00:50:13,515
passed away three years later.

594
00:50:14,475 --> 00:50:16,101
She had been frail from birth.

595
00:50:18,729 --> 00:50:20,147
I don't really remember it,

596
00:50:21,357 --> 00:50:24,068
but everyone knows it, and it's
the first time telling someone myself.

597
00:50:26,654 --> 00:50:30,032
But it's nice that you're the one
I'm telling this story to.

598
00:50:33,452 --> 00:50:35,871
You've turned out great, Gon.

599
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:41,877
We skipped a lot of things.

600
00:50:47,591 --> 00:50:49,218
When I was five,

601
00:50:50,386 --> 00:50:53,389
my parents ran
the Taekwondo center together.

602
00:50:54,515 --> 00:50:57,726
My mother was a really popular instructor.

603
00:50:58,769 --> 00:50:59,812
But she died of cancer.

604
00:51:03,232 --> 00:51:04,608
I'm still wearing

605
00:51:06,026 --> 00:51:07,278
my mother's black belt.

606
00:51:14,493 --> 00:51:15,786
You've turned out great,

607
00:51:16,954 --> 00:51:17,788
Tae-eul.

608
00:51:23,085 --> 00:51:24,295
Your Majesty?

609
00:51:28,048 --> 00:51:29,591
Hello, father.

610
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,726
I wasn't notified of your visit.

611
00:51:39,727 --> 00:51:40,894
It's not an official schedule.

612
00:51:41,562 --> 00:51:42,521
I was just passing by.

613
00:51:46,608 --> 00:51:47,526
Are you

614
00:51:48,694 --> 00:51:50,362
good at keeping secrets, by any chance?

615
00:51:50,446 --> 00:51:51,280
Pardon?

616
00:51:54,491 --> 00:51:57,077
God told me to set a guard over my mouth

617
00:51:57,619 --> 00:51:59,580
and keep watch over the door of my lips.

618
00:52:02,499 --> 00:52:04,752
Then would you take a photo for me?

619
00:52:07,004 --> 00:52:07,880
I want

620
00:52:08,881 --> 00:52:10,424
a photo of us together.

621
00:52:15,346 --> 00:52:16,180
All right.

622
00:52:19,558 --> 00:52:21,268
Three, two...

623
00:52:47,044 --> 00:52:51,465
<i>What is your reason for doing that?</i>

624
00:52:53,467 --> 00:52:56,678
<i>You were sitting alone by the stream.</i>

625
00:52:59,348 --> 00:53:02,351
<i>The green grass was sprouting</i>

626
00:53:05,479 --> 00:53:09,024
<i>and the water was splashing
from the spring breeze.</i>

627
00:53:12,111 --> 00:53:16,198
<i>You promised that even if you go,
you won't be gone forever.</i>

628
00:53:17,658 --> 00:53:20,744
<i>That is what you promised.</i>

629
00:53:22,788 --> 00:53:27,292
<i>I sit by the stream each day</i>

630
00:53:28,836 --> 00:53:32,047
<i>and think about something endlessly.</i>

631
00:53:34,466 --> 00:53:38,429
<i>When you promised that even if you go,
you won't be gone forever,</i>

632
00:53:40,597 --> 00:53:45,018
<i>were you asking me not to forget you?</i>

633
00:54:40,032 --> 00:54:40,866
It's all done.

634
00:54:41,909 --> 00:54:43,660
The medicine is for three days,

635
00:54:43,744 --> 00:54:45,954
and it contains antibiotics,
so you must not drink.

636
00:54:51,126 --> 00:54:52,586
She asked about it...

637
00:55:02,012 --> 00:55:02,888
Alcohol?

638
00:55:04,515 --> 00:55:05,724
It's just for disinfection.

639
00:55:06,016 --> 00:55:07,684
I was going to have just one glass.

640
00:55:07,976 --> 00:55:11,897
It'll help with my blood circulation
and let me recover quickly.

641
00:55:12,606 --> 00:55:14,191
I suddenly feel exhausted.

642
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,568
You should go.
I'm going to get some sleep.

643
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,737
I told you numerous times
that this is my room.

644
00:55:21,365 --> 00:55:22,366
Oh, right.

645
00:55:25,285 --> 00:55:27,829
Then where have you been sleeping?

646
00:55:31,166 --> 00:55:32,042
Here.

647
00:55:33,126 --> 00:55:34,002
Here?

648
00:55:35,128 --> 00:55:36,255
How?

649
00:55:36,547 --> 00:55:37,798
Next to you while you slept.

650
00:55:38,882 --> 00:55:40,259
It's a big bed, you know.

651
00:55:40,342 --> 00:55:41,593
Have you lost your mind?

652
00:55:42,177 --> 00:55:44,304
No wonder.
People were giving me strange looks.

653
00:55:48,684 --> 00:55:52,187
Don't overreact.
I didn't even hit you that hard.

654
00:55:54,147 --> 00:55:55,315
My shoulder is hurting

655
00:55:55,941 --> 00:55:56,984
like I've been burned.

656
00:55:59,319 --> 00:56:00,904
The scar that Yeong mentioned last time.

657
00:56:02,739 --> 00:56:05,284
Really? Let me see. Where is it?

658
00:56:38,901 --> 00:56:40,068
What's wrong?

659
00:56:43,488 --> 00:56:46,658
I think it's a side effect of crossing
the road of thunder and lightning.

660
00:56:48,452 --> 00:56:50,662
What about you? Aren't you hurting?

661
00:56:51,413 --> 00:56:52,915
No, I feel fine.

662
00:56:55,459 --> 00:56:57,085
Look. Do I have a scar too?

663
00:56:57,169 --> 00:56:58,170
Oh, you startled me.

664
00:57:00,297 --> 00:57:02,132
You can see this much in the summer,
you know.

665
00:57:02,758 --> 00:57:03,717
Look properly.

666
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:04,885
You're unbelievable.

667
00:57:07,262 --> 00:57:08,764
This hurts even more.

668
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:15,062
You don't have one.

669
00:57:16,146 --> 00:57:17,064
I don't?

670
00:57:19,316 --> 00:57:21,276
Then is it a random thing?

671
00:57:22,402 --> 00:57:23,445
It's strange.

672
00:57:24,613 --> 00:57:27,282
This means the rule of traveling
between worlds has been broken.

673
00:57:30,535 --> 00:57:31,495
What about this?

674
00:57:33,163 --> 00:57:35,123
The phrase we use when cursing bad people.

675
00:57:37,084 --> 00:57:38,585
"You deserve to get hit by lightning."

676
00:57:40,212 --> 00:57:41,838
I really wanted to stop beheading people.

677
00:57:42,422 --> 00:57:43,507
Go ahead and try me.

678
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:49,429
Hey, that's...

679
00:57:54,101 --> 00:57:55,727
I'm sure I told you

680
00:57:57,229 --> 00:58:00,107
that you could be beheaded for addressing
me with "hey," "this" or "that."

681
00:58:03,443 --> 00:58:04,695
Stop being ridiculous.

682
00:58:51,116 --> 00:58:52,367
Horrible weather, isn't it?

683
00:58:52,784 --> 00:58:53,827
I'm sorry.

684
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:55,328
It's fine. I didn't see you either.

685
01:01:46,875 --> 01:01:47,918
Why?

686
01:01:49,085 --> 01:01:50,337
Why?

687
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:56,551
Why are these scars appearing
here and there?

688
01:01:58,053 --> 01:01:58,887
Kill me.

689
01:02:01,431 --> 01:02:03,141
Just kill me!

690
01:02:12,317 --> 01:02:14,236
I didn't keep you alive

691
01:02:15,612 --> 01:02:17,322
just to kill you like this.

692
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:20,867
You're the perfect bait.

693
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:24,371
That's why I've kept you alive.

694
01:02:25,538 --> 01:02:27,123
If your son was alive,

695
01:02:28,041 --> 01:02:29,376
would he have grown up like him?

696
01:02:32,212 --> 01:02:33,713
You have the face

697
01:02:35,423 --> 01:02:38,093
of my nephew's mother.

698
01:03:09,165 --> 01:03:10,041
Welcome.

699
01:03:10,417 --> 01:03:11,626
Take a seat over there, please.

700
01:03:12,877 --> 01:03:14,212
Can't I use the private room?

701
01:03:14,296 --> 01:03:17,382
The Prime Minister is using it right now.

702
01:03:18,133 --> 01:03:19,384
You mean Seo-ryeong?

703
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:21,428
Without any guards?

704
01:03:22,804 --> 01:03:24,180
I want perilla seed noodles.

705
01:03:29,602 --> 01:03:31,938
It's been a while, Seo-ryeong.
I heard you were here alone.

706
01:03:33,273 --> 01:03:34,232
Can I sit?

707
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:35,567
Whatever.

708
01:03:38,987 --> 01:03:39,988
I heard you were sick.

709
01:03:41,239 --> 01:03:42,282
Yes.

710
01:03:42,949 --> 01:03:44,075
This is my first meal.

711
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,704
So let's not talk.
I don't want my food to get cold.

712
01:03:48,455 --> 01:03:49,873
The seat isn't for you.

713
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:52,167
It's for the baby.

714
01:03:52,834 --> 01:03:55,211
It must be a boy.
I'm eating so much these days.

715
01:03:56,463 --> 01:03:57,964
I didn't check the gender.

716
01:03:58,548 --> 01:03:59,466
It's a girl.

717
01:04:00,342 --> 01:04:01,384
What?

718
01:04:02,635 --> 01:04:03,678
Did you order something?

719
01:04:05,388 --> 01:04:06,431
It's coming soon.

720
01:04:07,766 --> 01:04:10,518
I heard you're visiting the Middle East
with my husband.

721
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:13,730
I guess Mr. Yoon is a family man.

722
01:04:14,522 --> 01:04:15,815
He talks about his work with you?

723
01:04:17,233 --> 01:04:18,318
He's wasting his time.

724
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:23,198
Aren't you the icon of wasting time
these days?

725
01:04:23,823 --> 01:04:26,242
It's too bad the four years
of effort is going to waste.

726
01:04:26,493 --> 01:04:28,161
It seems you're not going to be the queen.

727
01:04:31,706 --> 01:04:32,916
What do you mean?

728
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:34,876
You don't know?

729
01:04:35,919 --> 01:04:37,545
Were you really that sick?

730
01:04:37,837 --> 01:04:39,964
The King announced someone
as the future Queen.

731
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:43,760
Let me use your phone.

732
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:52,227
You didn't even bring your phone?

733
01:04:55,605 --> 01:04:56,898
KING ANNOUNCES FUTURE QUEEN

734
01:04:56,981 --> 01:04:59,192
You should really serve another term.

735
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,070
Or else you'll really just become

736
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:06,324
a daughter of a fish shop owner.

737
01:05:11,329 --> 01:05:12,539
Good luck with the baby.

738
01:05:13,164 --> 01:05:15,041
And make sure to give birth
in this Kingdom.

739
01:05:20,964 --> 01:05:22,674
What's she on about?

740
01:05:25,135 --> 01:05:26,636
Yes. All right.

741
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:29,055
Keep that jerk's mouth shut.

742
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:32,851
Your Majesty, Lee Sang-do
is saying he's in pain.

743
01:05:33,143 --> 01:05:34,018
Pain?

744
01:05:34,102 --> 01:05:36,896
Yes, apparently it feels like
he's burning and it happens when it rains.

745
01:05:44,946 --> 01:05:45,780
Your Majesty.

746
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:50,743
Prime Minister Koo
just entered the palace without a notice.

747
01:05:53,037 --> 01:05:54,497
I guess she finally feels better.

748
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:56,666
Where is she right now?

749
01:06:10,263 --> 01:06:11,681
You were on sick leave for a while.

750
01:06:12,807 --> 01:06:14,184
Are you feeling all right?

751
01:06:14,517 --> 01:06:15,351
Yes, Your Majesty.

752
01:06:16,769 --> 01:06:19,230
An unexpected piece of news
made me get up.

753
01:06:19,814 --> 01:06:21,566
Let's talk about that
after I'm done talking.

754
01:06:23,693 --> 01:06:24,527
Prime Minister Koo.

755
01:06:25,612 --> 01:06:26,821
You eventually pulled the gag.

756
01:06:28,281 --> 01:06:29,491
What's your reason?

757
01:06:30,283 --> 01:06:33,369
For tying me down, I mean.

758
01:06:33,453 --> 01:06:35,121
If I hadn't tied you down,

759
01:06:36,456 --> 01:06:38,666
where would you have gone?

760
01:06:40,919 --> 01:06:42,545
To make a marriage proposal?

761
01:06:46,257 --> 01:06:47,133
All right.

762
01:06:47,967 --> 01:06:49,260
Let's talk about that first.

763
01:06:49,886 --> 01:06:51,429
Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to talk.

764
01:06:55,767 --> 01:06:56,726
Everything in the news

765
01:06:57,894 --> 01:06:58,728
is true.

766
01:07:00,522 --> 01:07:01,397
She's

767
01:07:02,649 --> 01:07:03,942
the woman I love.

768
01:07:05,777 --> 01:07:09,489
I support her every step and every moment.

769
01:07:15,578 --> 01:07:17,539
You're always so honest, Your Majesty.

770
01:07:42,939 --> 01:07:45,316
It rains often since it's by the ocean.

771
01:07:45,608 --> 01:07:48,111
That's the only downside.

772
01:07:49,404 --> 01:07:50,655
Drink your tea.

773
01:07:59,664 --> 01:08:04,127
I'm sure you would have felt upset
about how I treated you.

774
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:11,968
I hope you understand
that it was all to protect His Majesty.

775
01:08:13,928 --> 01:08:14,887
It's all right.

776
01:08:19,225 --> 01:08:22,395
I'm going to ask you something.

777
01:08:23,396 --> 01:08:24,939
Can you answer me

778
01:08:25,315 --> 01:08:26,691
without asking anything else?

779
01:08:28,359 --> 01:08:30,320
And don't talk about this to anyone.

780
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:34,407
I'm willing to trust you

781
01:08:34,907 --> 01:08:36,993
because you seem to be
a government official.

782
01:08:40,455 --> 01:08:41,414
Go ahead.

783
01:08:46,044 --> 01:08:48,880
My name is Noh Ok-nam.

784
01:08:52,842 --> 01:08:56,846
My father is Noh Gi-seop,
my mother is Shin Jeong-ae,

785
01:08:56,929 --> 01:08:59,015
and my sister is Noh Yeong-nam.

786
01:09:00,266 --> 01:09:04,771
I was born in 1932, in Pyoksong
of Hwanghae Province.

787
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:08,608
I left my hometown at the age of 17,

788
01:09:09,233 --> 01:09:10,985
and I haven't heard any news of it

789
01:09:11,444 --> 01:09:13,404
for 67 years.

790
01:09:14,697 --> 01:09:15,865
So I want to ask...

791
01:09:21,537 --> 01:09:23,915
What happened to that war?

792
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:31,589
The war that broke out in June, 1950.

793

<i>His Majesty and Lieutenant Jeong...</i>

795
01:10:23,099 --> 01:10:24,434
<i>The two worlds are too far apart.</i>

796
01:10:24,517 --> 01:10:27,103
<i>What will you do?
Will you try to answer my question?</i>

797
01:10:27,186 --> 01:10:28,730
<i>Is there even a way for us?</i>

798
01:10:29,021 --> 01:10:30,732
Stop acting so cocky and move.

799
01:10:30,815 --> 01:10:32,608
Stop, Prime Minister Koo.

800
01:10:32,692 --> 01:10:33,609
<i>And if I stop you,</i>

801
01:10:33,693 --> 01:10:34,986
<i>-Tae-eul.
-will you stay?</i>

802
01:10:35,069 --> 01:10:37,029
<i>Should I tell you a secret before I die?</i>

803
01:10:37,113 --> 01:10:38,364
-I think I'm...
<i>-What are they?</i>

804
01:10:38,448 --> 01:10:39,699
<i>...about to find Lee Lim's bamboo forest.</i>

805
01:10:39,782 --> 01:10:40,700
<i>These scars...</i>

806
01:10:40,783 --> 01:10:42,410
<i>My counterpart. Did you meet her?</i>

807
01:10:42,493 --> 01:10:43,745
<i>Should I stay just for today?</i>

808
01:10:43,828 --> 01:10:45,246
We should see each other.

809
01:10:45,329 --> 01:10:47,081
If you see me now, you die.
