00:00:00,055 --> 00:00:04,914
THE KING: ETERNAL MONARCH

2
00:00:05,008 --> 00:00:07,510
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:07,594 --> 00:00:09,929
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,559
EPISODE 9

5
00:00:16,853 --> 00:00:18,980
This is the right address.

6
00:00:20,148 --> 00:00:22,317
I think it was set here on purpose.

7
00:00:22,817 --> 00:00:26,654
If she's being this thorough about hiding,
it'll take some time to find her.

8
00:00:27,697 --> 00:00:29,157
This made me confirm two things.

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,868
One is that Song Jeong-hye
is with Lee Lim,

10
00:00:33,078 --> 00:00:34,829
and the other is that
even though it's work,

11
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:36,706
it's nice to go somewhere far with you.

12
00:00:37,457 --> 00:00:38,458
Wherever it is.

13
00:00:41,419 --> 00:00:43,463
Do you get tutored
to learn phrases like that?

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,299
Surprisingly, I taught myself.

15
00:00:48,468 --> 00:00:49,719
I guess this is why everyone...

16
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,391
Everyone commits treason?

17
00:00:56,059 --> 00:00:57,602
Are you mad?

18
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,563
Do you think doing that is okay?

19
00:01:01,147 --> 00:01:03,525
I mean, it's why everyone
in the palace loves you.

20
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:05,985
You know how to joke
in difficult situations.

21
00:01:07,612 --> 00:01:10,198
I shouldn't have begun saying that.
We don't have time.

22
00:01:11,157 --> 00:01:12,242
That's what I was thinking.

23
00:01:14,452 --> 00:01:15,662
You thought of a lot of things

24
00:01:16,454 --> 00:01:17,580
in a short time.

25
00:01:18,706 --> 00:01:19,916
Why would you make a joke like that?

26
00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:21,835
It's a joke only I can make.

27
00:01:23,378 --> 00:01:25,880
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you'd be so startled.

28
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:31,302
I don't even know how to comfort you.

29
00:01:33,012 --> 00:01:34,764
There's a person I like,

30
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,309
but his past is so dramatic.
He's a victim of treason.

31
00:01:42,522 --> 00:01:44,899
Your earth is still flat.

32
00:01:44,983 --> 00:01:48,736
Yes, it's as flat as a thin pancake.

33
00:01:59,205 --> 00:02:00,832
I guess you were troubled

34
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,209
since Song Jeong-hye

35
00:02:04,794 --> 00:02:07,005
will have the face of my mother,

36
00:02:07,755 --> 00:02:08,756
right?

37
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:15,722
I thought that maybe
you'd want to see her.

38
00:02:18,308 --> 00:02:19,559
Not at all.

39
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,937
Like how Yeong and Eun-sup are
different people,

40
00:02:24,522 --> 00:02:26,191
she is not my mother either.

41
00:02:27,442 --> 00:02:30,069
The face is just a symbol of a person.

42
00:02:32,864 --> 00:02:34,199
Then let me ask just one question.

43
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:39,370
How do you go back and forth
between the two worlds?

44
00:02:40,038 --> 00:02:41,706
Both you and Lee Lim.

45
00:02:48,338 --> 00:02:50,298
I've answered all your questions
until now,

46
00:02:50,715 --> 00:02:51,883
and I will continue to do so.

47
00:02:52,383 --> 00:02:53,343
Except for that question

48
00:02:54,052 --> 00:02:55,386
you just asked.

49
00:02:59,557 --> 00:03:00,516
All right.

50
00:03:02,602 --> 00:03:05,104
Then it's really true
that it's your first time dating?

51
00:03:05,188 --> 00:03:06,272
That one's an exception too.

52
00:03:07,941 --> 00:03:08,816
Shall we go now?

53
00:03:09,776 --> 00:03:11,444
It's suddenly getting cold,
don't you think?

54
00:03:12,153 --> 00:03:14,822
In this world, we say that men
should always keep their word.

55
00:03:14,906 --> 00:03:16,199
Don't you say that in yours?

56
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:18,243
Oh, do you say that here?

57
00:03:23,706 --> 00:03:25,667
Who's the girl you made
steak and rice for?

58
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:27,919
I thought you had one question.

59
00:03:28,002 --> 00:03:29,712
You didn't even answer
one question so far.

60
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:32,298
I attended the Naval Academy.

61
00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:34,259
You're the only woman in my life.

62
00:03:35,343 --> 00:03:36,761
You have quite a wit.

63
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,973
I see that you don't.

64
00:03:47,397 --> 00:03:49,649
You looked good in the navy uniform.

65
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:51,651
Why are you holding my hand?

66
00:03:52,694 --> 00:03:54,779
Did you make steak and rice
for Koo Seo-ryeong or not?

67
00:03:55,196 --> 00:03:57,365
You didn't prepare
the rice in that uniform, did you?

68
00:04:05,832 --> 00:04:07,208
I barely made it on time.

69
00:04:08,793 --> 00:04:10,712
Listen carefully, and keep this in mind.

70
00:04:12,297 --> 00:04:14,173
I eat bread from this bakery
every morning.

71
00:04:14,257 --> 00:04:17,885
The bread here tastes exactly
like the bread at the Royal Court.

72
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,388
Why would I need to keep that in mind?

73
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:27,979
I'm a busy person.
Why did you bring me here?

74
00:04:28,062 --> 00:04:30,398
You spread the jam pretty thoroughly
for a busy person.

75
00:04:30,565 --> 00:04:31,774
Bread should be eaten with jam.

76
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,443
So why am I here?

77
00:04:38,197 --> 00:04:40,366
Keep in mind that it tastes
great without jam as well.

78
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,994
And what I'm about to say now
is even more important.

79
00:04:45,455 --> 00:04:46,622
From now on,

80
00:04:47,623 --> 00:04:49,792
you must be the real Unbreakable Sword.

81
00:04:51,627 --> 00:04:53,379
You must've lost your mind.

82
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:55,965
Can you turn around a bit?

83
00:04:57,884 --> 00:04:59,177
That looks like Yeong's coat.

84
00:04:59,927 --> 00:05:01,054
100 percent cashmere.

85
00:05:04,265 --> 00:05:05,433
The Unbreakable Sword?

86
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:07,769
I will do as you order.

87
00:05:08,895 --> 00:05:11,356
I didn't want to brag about myself,

88
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,442
but I'm actually skilled at dealing with
problems at the Public Service Center.

89
00:05:15,109 --> 00:05:16,235
What should I do first, Your Majesty?

90
00:05:19,947 --> 00:05:20,782
You're here.

91
00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:22,617
Did you eat dinner?

92
00:05:23,117 --> 00:05:26,287
I sent you a lot of clothes.
Why did you come wearing that?

93
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:27,955
Don't waste your money.

94
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:31,209
I didn't wear expensive clothes
even when we had rich in-laws.

95
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:32,543
That's a really long time ago.

96
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:34,754
You're right.

97
00:05:35,797 --> 00:05:38,132
I brought some boiled fish.

98
00:05:39,384 --> 00:05:42,053
Why don't you have just one bite with me?

99
00:05:42,136 --> 00:05:44,305
How can I eat at this hour?

100
00:05:49,685 --> 00:05:50,853
Just one bite, then.

101
00:05:54,982 --> 00:05:55,817
But Mom.

102
00:05:56,526 --> 00:05:58,319
You really didn't send me that newspaper?

103
00:05:59,112 --> 00:06:00,947
It's salty. Eat that with rice.

104
00:06:02,073 --> 00:06:05,076
And I really didn't send it.
What kind of newspaper was it?

105
00:06:06,994 --> 00:06:08,079
Never mind.

106
00:06:08,663 --> 00:06:10,081
I guess my secretary made a mistake.

107
00:06:10,706 --> 00:06:12,208
Lots of stuff gets sent to my office.

108
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,378
Is everything okay at home?

109
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:17,004
It's always the same, you know.

110
00:06:20,049 --> 00:06:21,217
By the way...

111
00:06:21,926 --> 00:06:23,678
About that dead Lee Lim...

112
00:06:26,013 --> 00:06:27,598
Did he have a hidden child or something?

113
00:06:27,682 --> 00:06:29,767
Don't be ridiculous.

114
00:06:29,851 --> 00:06:32,895
He died the year after he committed
treason without an heir.

115
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:33,855
Right?

116
00:06:35,606 --> 00:06:38,484
But the customer who left the umbrella
at the store

117
00:06:38,568 --> 00:06:40,695
came to get it a few days ago.

118
00:06:41,863 --> 00:06:44,699
He looked just like Lee Lim
when he was alive.

119
00:06:44,782 --> 00:06:45,616
So I thought

120
00:06:46,451 --> 00:06:48,786
maybe he had a son.

121
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,166
Mom, you'll get in huge trouble
if you say things like that.

122
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:55,293
The King doesn't have an heir yet.

123
00:06:55,668 --> 00:06:57,044
A bastard of the traitor?

124
00:06:59,172 --> 00:07:00,840
If you spread rumors like that,

125
00:07:01,757 --> 00:07:03,009
it'll be the end of me.

126
00:07:03,634 --> 00:07:05,386
Your daughter
is the Prime Minister, you know.

127
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:09,182
I'm going to go and change.

128
00:07:09,265 --> 00:07:10,141
All right.

129
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:16,063
I didn't tell anyone.
You're the only one I told.

130
00:07:17,106 --> 00:07:18,774
I really won't tell anyone.

131
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:37,043
YEONGSIN DRAGON SEES HOPE
FOR THE FALL BASEBALL SEASON

132
00:08:02,527 --> 00:08:03,986
Stay right here, okay?

133
00:08:04,987 --> 00:08:06,239
I'll come back for you soon.

134
00:08:12,995 --> 00:08:14,080
I'll be back soon, okay?

135
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,707
<i>Today is the 6th day
of the former King's funeral.</i>

136
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,584
<i>After his coronation, King Lee Gon</i>

137
00:08:19,085 --> 00:08:21,837
<i>began his first duty as King, mourning
his father's death for 26 days</i>

138
00:08:22,171 --> 00:08:25,758
<i>-according to court laws.
-Father...</i>

139
00:08:25,841 --> 00:08:27,969
<i>The public is watching
the young King's formality</i>

140
00:08:28,052 --> 00:08:32,848
<i>-with a sad heart.
-Father...</i>

141
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,395
<i>Father...</i>

142
00:08:37,478 --> 00:08:39,313
<i>A black plum blossom
on a white background...</i>

143
00:08:39,397 --> 00:08:41,315
<i>-Father...
-The people,</i>

144
00:08:42,316 --> 00:08:43,192
<i>the wailing...</i>

145
00:08:44,485 --> 00:08:45,861
That boy who was crying...

146
00:08:47,863 --> 00:08:48,823
That was really you?

147
00:08:50,908 --> 00:08:51,993
Are you really

148
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,037
Lee Gon?

149
00:08:56,664 --> 00:08:57,999
<i>He heard my wailing.</i>

150
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,209
A lot more people

151
00:09:01,502 --> 00:09:03,796
have come over
to this world than I had thought.

152
00:09:06,507 --> 00:09:07,800
Answer my question, asshole.

153
00:09:08,593 --> 00:09:10,511
Hands off, unless you want to die.

154
00:09:15,182 --> 00:09:16,225
One thing is for sure.

155
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,522
You are the reason
why I must return to my world.

156
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,442
It seems like

157
00:09:28,112 --> 00:09:29,614
I am your king.

158
00:09:37,663 --> 00:09:38,623
Can I ask

159
00:09:39,206 --> 00:09:41,542
what else you remember
besides the wailing?

160
00:09:42,501 --> 00:09:43,544
A particular location

161
00:09:44,837 --> 00:09:45,796
or person.

162
00:09:55,348 --> 00:09:56,182
Help me,

163
00:09:56,682 --> 00:09:58,142
then I will help you.

164
00:09:59,685 --> 00:10:01,312
Whatever you're looking for,

165
00:10:02,563 --> 00:10:04,649
I'm sure I'm the closest person to it.

166
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:08,944
You want to help me?

167
00:10:10,821 --> 00:10:12,365
Then get lost to where you came from.

168
00:10:16,118 --> 00:10:16,952
You too.

169
00:10:17,995 --> 00:10:21,499
If I spot you again, I'll arrest you

170
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:23,793
for illegal firearm possession.

171
00:10:42,395 --> 00:10:43,312
Don't worry.

172
00:10:44,522 --> 00:10:45,439
He left as a detective,

173
00:10:46,691 --> 00:10:48,150
and as a close friend of someone.

174
00:10:49,151 --> 00:10:50,778
-But Your Majesty--
-I know.

175
00:10:51,654 --> 00:10:54,281
Lee Lim brought him here,
like the one in the basement.

176
00:10:55,616 --> 00:10:57,618
He only remembers the emblem, so I guess

177
00:10:58,911 --> 00:11:00,246
he came here when he was little.

178
00:11:01,831 --> 00:11:04,083
Why bring a child here?

179
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:06,711
He must have

180
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:09,380
needed his parents.

181
00:11:11,006 --> 00:11:13,175
Whether it was his parents
in this world or ours.

182
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:16,804
I'll investigate this world
while you're away.

183
00:11:39,702 --> 00:11:41,203
Why did you call me outside?

184
00:11:41,704 --> 00:11:43,581
-It's cold, let's--
-I met Eun-sup just now.

185
00:11:47,793 --> 00:11:49,044
But he wasn't Eun-sup.

186
00:11:53,674 --> 00:11:54,675
I guess you already knew.

187
00:11:57,094 --> 00:11:57,970
Sin-jae,

188
00:11:58,679 --> 00:11:59,597
how much have you seen?

189
00:12:01,682 --> 00:12:02,641
What about you?

190
00:12:03,225 --> 00:12:04,226
How far have you gone?

191
00:12:05,102 --> 00:12:06,771
The science fiction you were talking about

192
00:12:08,981 --> 00:12:09,899
was that jerk?

193
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,652
Do you really believe everything
that jerk is telling you?

194
00:12:15,821 --> 00:12:16,655
Yes.

195
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:20,034
-I do.
-Why would you believe him?

196
00:12:20,701 --> 00:12:22,578
-What do you believe?
-Everything.

197
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,205
I believe everything.

198
00:12:24,872 --> 00:12:27,500
I'll explain everything I can to you.

199
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:30,211
I actually need your help--

200
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,822
You must have lost your mom.

201
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:06,121
I'll find her for you.

202
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:09,750
<i>Sin-jae...</i>

203
00:13:09,834 --> 00:13:11,335
Sin-jae...

204
00:13:13,003 --> 00:13:14,380
Doctor!

205
00:13:14,588 --> 00:13:17,883
Doctor, he's awake! My son is awake!

206
00:13:19,593 --> 00:13:20,594
Can you see me?

207
00:13:21,887 --> 00:13:23,430
Can you recognize me?

208
00:13:25,432 --> 00:13:27,643
My baby, Sin-jae...

Cheers!

211
00:14:11,979 --> 00:14:14,273
You did a great job, Eun-sup.

212
00:14:14,356 --> 00:14:16,066
Congratulations on becoming a civilian.

213
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,152
Thank you, it's an honor.

214
00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:20,821
You gathered for me on your day off.

215
00:14:22,197 --> 00:14:23,324
Wow,

216
00:14:23,782 --> 00:14:25,367
look at the marbling of the meat.

217
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,496
The meat is unbelievable.

218
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,248
How can it be so tasty?

219
00:14:31,332 --> 00:14:33,959
You only need to flip the beef over once.

220
00:14:34,627 --> 00:14:36,378
-Chief, enjoy your food.
-Yeah.

221
00:14:37,671 --> 00:14:38,672
Eat up.

222
00:14:38,756 --> 00:14:40,299
Why aren't you eating?

223
00:14:42,635 --> 00:14:44,887
You should eat too.

224
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:48,057
Congratulations, sir.

225
00:14:52,728 --> 00:14:55,064
What? I'm two years older than him.

226
00:14:55,648 --> 00:14:56,732
Oh, right.

227
00:14:56,815 --> 00:14:57,900
Yes, that's right.

228
00:14:59,026 --> 00:15:02,112
Hey, is Sin-jae coming or not?

229
00:15:04,114 --> 00:15:06,241
I'll try messaging him again.

230
00:15:06,992 --> 00:15:09,036
He's coming. He has to.
We're eating barbecue.

00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:10,621
<i>You got Jangmi's message, right?</i>

00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:12,456
<i>We're celebrating Eun-sup's discharge.</i>

233
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:13,666
-<i>Where are you?</i>
-Hey, Eun-sup!

234
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,001
Congratulations on your discharge!

235
00:15:16,085 --> 00:15:19,505
Thank you. The world is my oyster now.

236
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,839

SATURDAY CONCERT

240
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,548
A police officer visited the care center.

241
00:16:03,841 --> 00:16:07,094
They sent the officer away without
causing suspicion, so it's fine.

242
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,264
But Jang Yeon-ji caused some
trouble and is in jail right now.

243
00:16:11,265 --> 00:16:13,183
I canceled the service
for the phone we gave her,

244
00:16:13,267 --> 00:16:14,935
and I'm working to retrieve it.

245
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:16,687
And...

246
00:16:18,147 --> 00:16:19,064
And?

247
00:16:21,316 --> 00:16:24,486
That jerk Kim Gi-hwan disappeared.

248
00:16:26,572 --> 00:16:27,865
I'm still looking for him.

249
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,786
<i>A crack...</i>

250
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:35,456
I hate that.

251
00:16:40,377 --> 00:16:41,962
<i>I suppose this is just for</i>

252
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,715
<i>answering the calls

253
00:16:45,924 --> 00:16:47,259
<i>Take your own life.</i>

254
00:16:49,595 --> 00:16:50,596
It is a suicide order.

00:17:10,074 --> 00:17:12,868
This is a cooperative investigation

<i>Keep shaking while you're being shaken.</i>

<i>Make a crack to regain balance...</i>

260
00:17:31,095 --> 00:17:32,596
Weren't you taking the day off?

261
00:17:32,971 --> 00:17:34,389
You said you're going to play golf.

262
00:17:35,057 --> 00:17:36,016
Yes, in the afternoon.

263
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:41,480
KU Group's legal team
wants an interview with you.

264
00:17:42,064 --> 00:17:43,398
Are you playing golf with them?

265
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:46,652
KU Group promised that
they'll hire one million new recruits

266
00:17:46,735 --> 00:17:48,821
during the first half of next year.

267
00:17:49,696 --> 00:17:54,618
The King took all the credit
for winning the war.

268
00:17:57,704 --> 00:17:59,248
We should at least resolve
the employment problem.

269
00:17:59,331 --> 00:18:01,458
If that's the only reason,
there's no need to meet them.

270
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:06,130
You said you wanted to know
where Congressman Park's photo came from.

271
00:18:08,257 --> 00:18:09,091
When are you free?

272
00:18:10,092 --> 00:18:11,635
Chairman Choe was asking for your visit.

273
00:18:14,304 --> 00:18:15,472
I guess he's bored.

274
00:18:19,977 --> 00:18:20,811
Tonight.

275
00:18:28,068 --> 00:18:30,696
<i>The sky bestows the heart upon us,</i>

<i>and the ground</i>

<i>helps the spirit.</i>

278
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:37,744
The sun and the moon are formed.

279
00:18:38,412 --> 00:18:41,290
As the mountains and streams form,

280
00:18:42,457 --> 00:18:44,251
lightning strikes.

281
00:18:46,503 --> 00:18:47,379

00:18:59,224 --> 00:19:00,225

RESTRICTED NUMBER

289
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:24,958
<i>Your Highness.</i>

290
00:19:26,376 --> 00:19:27,502
Do you know

291
00:19:29,004 --> 00:19:32,466
what the phrase on that sword means?

292
00:19:33,175 --> 00:19:35,552
Yes, it states the duties of a king.

293
00:19:37,012 --> 00:19:39,389
So will Your Highness

294
00:19:40,224 --> 00:19:42,351
fulfill all those duties?

295
00:19:49,066 --> 00:19:50,859
A sage is moved to defeat

296
00:19:53,737 --> 00:19:56,281
the evil of the mountains and streams.

297
00:19:57,532 --> 00:19:59,284
<i>Wield it with deep thoughts</i>

298
00:20:00,285 --> 00:20:01,620
<i>and make things right.</i>

299
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:07,292
Do you remember my voice?

300
00:20:11,546 --> 00:20:12,965
I remember yours.

301
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:16,969
<i>You'll need to do a better job hiding.</i>

302
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:21,056
I've just found out

303
00:20:24,685 --> 00:20:26,270
that you're in the Republic of Korea.

304
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:58,176
You're wearing the shoes
I bought for you, Prime Minister Koo.

305
00:20:59,136 --> 00:21:01,638
You bought it for so many bitches
that it became a trend.

306
00:21:05,892 --> 00:21:08,312
They say even ex-husbands
can be useful somehow.

307
00:21:09,021 --> 00:21:09,896
That saying was right.

308
00:21:10,647 --> 00:21:11,857
I'm a bit late in thanking you.

309
00:21:12,858 --> 00:21:14,484
That photo of Congressman Park was useful.

310
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,529
How does KU get photos like that?

311
00:21:18,322 --> 00:21:19,948
Can you not? You just sat down...

312
00:21:21,658 --> 00:21:23,076
Don't ask leading questions.

313
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:27,164
What kind of wife spies on her husband
24 hours a day?

314
00:21:27,247 --> 00:21:28,665
Just tell me why you called me here.

315
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,668
Isn't it obvious?

316
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:36,506
I was thinking that maybe I would get
something in return for what I did.

317
00:21:39,634 --> 00:21:41,345
How about a special pardon for Christmas?

318
00:21:42,095 --> 00:21:43,180
I've been good.

319
00:21:44,514 --> 00:21:45,432
Don't you know

320
00:21:45,515 --> 00:21:47,559
that Santa doesn't give presents to guys

321
00:21:47,768 --> 00:21:51,355
who commit a breach of duty,
embezzlement, and diversion of funds?

322
00:21:51,897 --> 00:21:53,940
Wow, I'm so disappointed.

323
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,277
I even donated to summer church camps.

324
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,990
I saw your photo with the King.

325
00:22:02,699 --> 00:22:04,368
You were totally clinging to him.

326
00:22:04,451 --> 00:22:06,286
A Prime Minister
wiretapping the royal court?

327
00:22:08,413 --> 00:22:09,498
That's treason, you know.

328
00:22:09,581 --> 00:22:10,832
Don't blackmail me.

329
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,877
I still have the files
from wiretapping you.

330
00:22:15,295 --> 00:22:16,546
Guyeon tunnel project

331
00:22:17,714 --> 00:22:18,799
seems to be the fishiest.

332
00:22:22,677 --> 00:22:24,012
You're really scary.

333
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:27,099
I was just saying that
because I'm worried.

334
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:31,311
Are you really trying
to become the Queen now?

335
00:22:31,395 --> 00:22:32,270
Can't I?

336
00:22:33,063 --> 00:22:34,773
Greed is the most sincere emotion.

337
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,317
What's so bad about staying true
to my emotions?

338
00:22:37,692 --> 00:22:39,820
I wanted to become an announcer,

339
00:22:40,237 --> 00:22:42,155
I wanted to get married to a rich man,

340
00:22:42,823 --> 00:22:44,324
<i>I wanted to become the Prime Minister,</i>

341
00:22:45,283 --> 00:22:47,160
<i>and now I want to become the Queen.</i>

342
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:49,704
<i>There's no limited term for the Queen.</i>

343
00:22:51,331 --> 00:22:55,001
The King of the Kingdom of Corea
accepts the people's decision

344
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:58,213
and allows Prime Minister Koo
to form the Cabinet.

345
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:00,632
<i>I...</i>

346
00:23:01,341 --> 00:23:03,009
<i>came a very long way.</i>

347
00:23:04,344 --> 00:23:06,680
<i>I climbed up here from the very bottom.</i>

348
00:23:08,557 --> 00:23:11,268
How can you be
so ambitious your whole life?

349
00:23:12,352 --> 00:23:14,062
I'm sincere about everything.

350
00:23:15,105 --> 00:23:16,898
My greed and my ambition, too.

351
00:23:19,192 --> 00:23:21,194
Don't even dream about a Christmas present

352
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:23,113
and just wait for Buddha's birthday.

353
00:23:23,196 --> 00:23:25,407
Let's go to church instead of a temple.

354
00:23:25,574 --> 00:23:29,411
Take care of that deal
your legal team offered first.

355
00:23:30,871 --> 00:23:31,830
And one more thing.

356
00:23:38,795 --> 00:23:40,922
I keep getting mail from my mom,
but she never sent any.

357
00:23:41,923 --> 00:23:43,175
Are you getting blackmailed?

358
00:23:43,258 --> 00:23:44,301
It could be a negotiation.

359
00:23:46,094 --> 00:23:48,930
Find the ones who participated
in the treason 25 years ago.

360
00:23:49,014 --> 00:23:51,558
Why would you negotiate
with the traitor's followers?

361
00:23:52,058 --> 00:23:54,060
You want to catch the traitors
to become the Queen?

362
00:23:54,561 --> 00:23:55,395
And you want me

363
00:23:56,396 --> 00:23:57,230
to do that for you?

364
00:23:58,315 --> 00:24:00,817
If rumors spread about me trying
to catch those traitors

365
00:24:02,194 --> 00:24:03,945
a year before my term ends,
I'll be finished.

366
00:24:06,406 --> 00:24:08,366
This is what you're doing on your own.

367
00:24:09,034 --> 00:24:10,285
If you want to at least go to a temple.

368
00:24:15,582 --> 00:24:17,959
Is this how you ask for a favor?

369
00:24:19,336 --> 00:24:21,254
Promise me we'll go to a temple, then.

370
00:24:32,849 --> 00:24:34,809
Wow, this thing is pretty smart.

371
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,356
I only ordered food a few times, but
it recommends the stuff Mr. Lee likes.

372
00:24:43,944 --> 00:24:44,945
Enjoy your food.

373
00:24:45,028 --> 00:24:45,946
Thank you.

374
00:24:51,201 --> 00:24:52,994
Hey, where are you?

375
00:24:53,703 --> 00:24:54,788
I'm here by the...

376
00:24:56,331 --> 00:24:57,249
I'm here too.

377
00:24:58,542 --> 00:24:59,751
Next to you.

378
00:25:00,377 --> 00:25:01,211
Right here.

379
00:25:03,296 --> 00:25:04,798
You found your way easily.

380
00:25:06,424 --> 00:25:07,842
This place is a popular dating spot.

381
00:25:08,718 --> 00:25:10,428
I guess you came here often in your world.

382
00:25:11,596 --> 00:25:12,597
Of course, I've been here.

383
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:14,849
I knew it.

384
00:25:15,475 --> 00:25:16,393
With who?

385
00:25:19,187 --> 00:25:20,355
The Minister and Vice Minister of Land,

386
00:25:20,438 --> 00:25:22,065
Infrastructure and Transport,
four secretaries,

387
00:25:22,148 --> 00:25:23,775
the mayor, directors,
and section chiefs of Seoul--

388
00:25:23,858 --> 00:25:24,985
Let's eat.

389
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,991
Couples in the Republic of Korea
spend time near the water like this.

390
00:25:31,616 --> 00:25:33,368
When they break up, they push each other.

391
00:25:41,585 --> 00:25:42,586
This is pretty nice.

392
00:25:43,837 --> 00:25:46,756
Alcohol, stars, water, chicken

393
00:25:48,842 --> 00:25:49,759
and jealousy.

394
00:25:51,511 --> 00:25:52,554
Everything is perfect.

395
00:25:57,726 --> 00:25:59,019
Eat up and regain your strength.

396
00:26:01,313 --> 00:26:02,272
And have a good trip.

397
00:26:06,776 --> 00:26:09,321
You said you receive
administration reports every Friday.

398
00:26:10,405 --> 00:26:11,823
And today's Thursday.

399
00:26:15,952 --> 00:26:16,995
You remember that?

400
00:26:19,247 --> 00:26:20,498
What kind of condition is that?

401
00:26:22,459 --> 00:26:24,127
Do you realize you're a bad boyfriend?

402
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,598
I'm risking punishment for leaking
the case info by giving you this.

403
00:26:37,349 --> 00:26:40,769
But I think the answer to this
is in your world.

404
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,188
This person is dead in my world.

405
00:26:46,733 --> 00:26:48,360
He is the son of the master Lee Gu-yong.

406
00:26:49,527 --> 00:26:51,071
Your Majesty!

407
00:26:54,991 --> 00:26:56,493
I already know the answer.

408
00:26:57,118 --> 00:26:58,370
I've met him in person before.

409
00:27:00,246 --> 00:27:01,665
You met Lee Sang-do?

410
00:27:02,415 --> 00:27:03,291
Lee Sang-do

411
00:27:04,167 --> 00:27:05,794
is alive?

412
00:27:06,378 --> 00:27:07,504
Yes. I'll take care of this.

413
00:27:08,088 --> 00:27:09,130
I'm giving you a job too.

414
00:27:09,714 --> 00:27:12,467
I'm leaving Yeong here
and taking Eun-sup instead.

415
00:27:14,135 --> 00:27:15,178
What do you mean?

416
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:16,888
Lee Lim is here right now,

417
00:27:18,056 --> 00:27:19,057
in the Republic of Korea.

418
00:27:20,058 --> 00:27:21,434
Then you shouldn't leave.

419
00:27:22,185 --> 00:27:23,228
If he's here right now.

420
00:27:23,311 --> 00:27:26,231
I have to go. I should go
and guard the path between our worlds.

421
00:27:26,815 --> 00:27:27,857
He must be caught

422
00:27:29,025 --> 00:27:30,527
in my world.

423
00:27:32,362 --> 00:27:33,863
That is why I'm leaving Yeong here.

424
00:27:35,365 --> 00:27:36,533
In the worst-case scenario,

425
00:27:37,992 --> 00:27:40,161
the only one who can kill him
in this world

426
00:27:41,454 --> 00:27:42,414
is Yeong.

427
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,044
So,

428
00:27:49,504 --> 00:27:52,507
this was really a matter
of life and death.

429
00:28:01,766 --> 00:28:03,309
I'm sorry about causing trouble

430
00:28:05,395 --> 00:28:06,354
in your world.

431
00:28:15,447 --> 00:28:16,865
I was pretending to be okay,

432
00:28:18,491 --> 00:28:19,743
but I'm not okay.

433
00:28:22,328 --> 00:28:23,538
You'll be back soon, right?

434
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:27,834
I'll be back soon.

435
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,296
It'll be like visiting the next town over.

436
00:28:33,381 --> 00:28:34,674
That's how quick I'll be.

437
00:28:42,307 --> 00:28:43,224
No way.

438
00:28:44,058 --> 00:28:45,018
Don't come near me.

439
00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:49,105
That's never going to happen. Do you know
how long it took for it to grow?

440
00:28:52,192 --> 00:28:53,735
I never grow my hair long.

441
00:28:53,818 --> 00:28:55,653
You could grow it long
during your vacation.

442
00:28:55,987 --> 00:28:57,655
I'll just say you felt too lazy to cut it.

443
00:29:01,284 --> 00:29:03,328
Should I just cut off
your whole head instead?

444
00:29:04,162 --> 00:29:06,706
We could just get rid of your head
instead of your hair.

445
00:29:07,123 --> 00:29:10,585
Can't you keep such thoughts
just in your head?

446
00:29:17,509 --> 00:29:20,386
Click, click, click.

447
00:29:26,726 --> 00:29:28,728
You only think about the future, right?

448
00:29:31,064 --> 00:29:32,732
People like that

449
00:29:33,525 --> 00:29:37,111
can't win against people
who only think about the present.

450
00:30:00,386 --> 00:30:03,597
<i>Sub-captain Seok, head to the bamboo
forest near the race tracks right now.</i>

451
00:30:04,807 --> 00:30:06,600
<i>His Majesty will be waiting for you there.</i>

452
00:30:07,518 --> 00:30:10,604
<i>Take only a few guards,
and don't get curious about anything.</i>

453
00:30:11,146 --> 00:30:12,815
<i>Don't ask any questions.</i>

454
00:30:13,983 --> 00:30:15,025
<i>It's the King's orders.</i>

455
00:30:20,155 --> 00:30:21,073
Your Majesty!

456
00:30:22,741 --> 00:30:23,575
Captain Jo!

457
00:30:25,077 --> 00:30:26,537
This man participated in the treason.

458
00:30:27,246 --> 00:30:29,623
Lock him up in the deepest basement
of the palace.

459
00:30:29,707 --> 00:30:32,751
And I forbid you to make any records
about him

460
00:30:33,711 --> 00:30:34,795
or mention him to anyone.

461
00:30:34,878 --> 00:30:35,963
-Yes, Your Majesty!
-Yes, Your Majesty!

462
00:30:40,426 --> 00:30:43,095
I'm telling you this in case you think
that this is the end.

463
00:30:43,887 --> 00:30:45,347
This is only the beginning

464
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:48,559
for those who committed treason.

465
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,353
This is the appropriate

466
00:30:52,646 --> 00:30:53,564
and right measure.

467
00:31:00,404 --> 00:31:02,740
JO YEONG

468
00:31:12,124 --> 00:31:15,336
Why does it feel like I'm joining
the military again? My gosh.

469
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:17,254
<i>Put on a bulletproof jacket
as soon as you get there.</i>

470
00:31:17,338 --> 00:31:19,798
It's not for your protection,
it's for you to protect the King.

471
00:31:19,882 --> 00:31:22,176
You must protect him
with your life, all right?

472
00:31:22,843 --> 00:31:24,970
This seems too thin.
Can it really stop bullets?

473
00:31:25,054 --> 00:31:26,597
I should wear three of these.

474
00:31:27,389 --> 00:31:28,432
-Captain Jo?
-Yes, sir...

475
00:31:28,515 --> 00:31:29,850
I mean what?

476
00:31:29,933 --> 00:31:31,226
Are you going home right away?

477
00:31:31,602 --> 00:31:34,146
When should I make the report
on what happened while you were away?

478
00:31:34,813 --> 00:31:35,814
A North Korean accent?

479
00:31:37,066 --> 00:31:38,108
North Korea?

480
00:31:45,115 --> 00:31:46,200
The Northern region?

481
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:48,452
The North...

482
00:31:49,537 --> 00:31:50,871
Winter is coming.

483
00:31:52,873 --> 00:31:53,749
Pyongyang University?

484
00:31:54,249 --> 00:31:55,417
Seok Ho-pil?

485
00:31:56,168 --> 00:31:58,420
He must've been named
after a TV series character.

486
00:32:01,465 --> 00:32:02,299
Sub-captain Seok,

487
00:32:02,966 --> 00:32:04,551
what I say from now on is top secret.

488
00:32:05,636 --> 00:32:06,470
Yes, Your Majesty!

489
00:32:06,553 --> 00:32:09,264
First, place guards
around the bamboo forest.

490
00:32:09,348 --> 00:32:11,809
Stand watch starting today
until I give further orders,

491
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,520
and arrest anyone who appears.

492
00:32:15,687 --> 00:32:17,689
Be aware especially of a man in his 70s.

493
00:32:19,108 --> 00:32:22,027
Secondly, bring me
all the security footage taken

494
00:32:22,111 --> 00:32:23,987
near the events I attended
during the past year.

495
00:32:24,405 --> 00:32:25,322
As soon as possible.

496
00:32:26,615 --> 00:32:27,950
Excuse me, Your Majesty, but...

497
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:30,744
Are you the one giving orders

498
00:32:31,245 --> 00:32:32,371
and not Captain Jo?

499
00:32:34,373 --> 00:32:36,542
Yeong is taking care
of something more important.

500
00:32:39,878 --> 00:32:41,213
Yes, Your Majesty!

501
00:32:42,714 --> 00:32:46,802
Yeong, bring your laptop.
It's your laptop, you understand?

502
00:32:49,513 --> 00:32:50,347
"Yes, Your Majesty!"

503
00:32:52,266 --> 00:32:54,601
That's what you should say.

504
00:32:57,312 --> 00:32:58,439
Yes, Your Majesty!

505
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:13,620
Lady Noh, His Majesty is here.

506
00:33:22,254 --> 00:33:24,756
Did you even know that I came back?

507
00:33:27,176 --> 00:33:31,305
Your King has returned to the palace,
but you didn't come to see me once.

508
00:33:31,513 --> 00:33:34,641
Well, you left without seeing me,
Your Majesty.

509
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:37,102
I sent the vice-captain

510
00:33:37,186 --> 00:33:39,146
and I received the report
that you arrived.

511
00:33:40,772 --> 00:33:41,940
I saw your face too.

512
00:33:43,317 --> 00:33:44,860
You may leave now.

513
00:33:55,871 --> 00:33:56,830
Oh, no.

514
00:33:57,998 --> 00:33:59,500
Look how rough your face has become.

515
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:05,214
Did you stay up every night
worrying about me?

516
00:34:05,923 --> 00:34:06,798
Is that why?

517
00:34:07,466 --> 00:34:08,467
My goodness.

518
00:34:09,301 --> 00:34:12,095
I've been at peace since you weren't here.

519
00:34:13,013 --> 00:34:15,307
I slept soundly from early in the evening.

520
00:34:17,684 --> 00:34:19,811
There must be a lot of work
to catch up on.

521
00:34:20,687 --> 00:34:22,439
You should go now.

522
00:34:24,233 --> 00:34:25,567
Why do you keep telling me to go?

523
00:34:26,026 --> 00:34:27,402
Why aren't you asking me anything?

524
00:34:28,654 --> 00:34:30,072
I was going to tell you everything

525
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:35,118
if you asked me where I was.

526
00:34:44,962 --> 00:34:46,004
I already know.

527
00:34:46,672 --> 00:34:47,798
I know

528
00:34:49,049 --> 00:34:50,467
where you're going.

529
00:34:57,099 --> 00:35:01,853
You're chasing your destiny, aren't you?

530
00:35:06,066 --> 00:35:10,320
This is a secret
between you and me, right?

531
00:35:30,757 --> 00:35:32,676
-Your Majesty.
-Carry on with your work.

532
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,177
Yes, Your Majesty.

533
00:35:34,928 --> 00:35:36,555
All right, let's finish up.

534
00:35:50,611 --> 00:35:52,696
Your Majesty, is there something
you'd like to order--

535
00:35:52,779 --> 00:35:53,864
No.

536
00:35:55,991 --> 00:35:57,117
My goodness!

537
00:35:57,868 --> 00:35:59,161
How can you make such a mistake?

538
00:36:14,217 --> 00:36:15,052
How could you

539
00:36:15,761 --> 00:36:16,845
when you don't even have

540
00:36:20,098 --> 00:36:20,932
the guts

541
00:36:23,143 --> 00:36:24,478
nor the caliber?

542
00:36:29,024 --> 00:36:31,360
Until I give further orders,
put him under house arrest

543
00:36:31,443 --> 00:36:33,236
and forbid him from entering the palace.

544
00:36:34,196 --> 00:36:35,405
He is to be forbidden from

545
00:36:36,156 --> 00:36:37,949
contacting and meeting anyone else
from now on.

546
00:36:38,742 --> 00:36:40,202
SEOUL JONGNO POLICE STATION

547
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:42,371
Sin-jae went on vacation?

548
00:36:42,871 --> 00:36:44,206
He's using all 21 days in one go.

549
00:36:45,248 --> 00:36:47,417
You don't know what's going on either?

550
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:52,130
I'll try calling him.

551
00:36:52,673 --> 00:36:54,049
Is something going on at home?

552
00:36:54,716 --> 00:36:57,010
My gosh, maybe his mother...

553
00:36:57,094 --> 00:36:57,928
Hey, stop it.

554
00:36:58,011 --> 00:36:59,846
I'm just worried.

555
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,181
I think it's because of her.

556
00:37:10,857 --> 00:37:11,858
Sin-jae.

557
00:37:13,568 --> 00:37:16,530
Hwa-yeon, this is Tae-eul.

558
00:37:20,617 --> 00:37:22,744
SIN-JAE

559
00:37:39,428 --> 00:37:41,888
I knew today was going to be my lucky day.

560
00:37:42,305 --> 00:37:45,851
We have a precious guest
even before opening hours.

561
00:37:51,356 --> 00:37:54,484
Detective Kang, I guess
you're feeling a bit down.

562
00:37:55,277 --> 00:37:57,529
They say sharing your sadness
with someone makes it better.

563
00:37:58,238 --> 00:37:59,573
Do you want to share it with me?

564
00:38:04,286 --> 00:38:08,165
If you want to do some sharing,
why don't you share some peanuts?

565
00:38:09,916 --> 00:38:11,334
The food here is too expensive.

566
00:38:11,543 --> 00:38:15,005
I'm so upset that you're worried
about the cost of our food.

567
00:38:15,589 --> 00:38:17,758
Why are you so humble?

568
00:38:18,925 --> 00:38:21,386
Anyhow, thank you for visiting
when you're having a rough time.

569
00:38:22,596 --> 00:38:23,847
You made the right choice.

570
00:38:24,306 --> 00:38:25,140
Stuff like this

571
00:38:26,725 --> 00:38:29,352
can be comforting
when things get rough. Here.

572
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,899
You can have all the food
you want with this.

573
00:38:44,242 --> 00:38:45,076
Here.

574
00:38:46,036 --> 00:38:47,579
Do you accept payments in installments?

575
00:38:49,623 --> 00:38:51,374
And count this one out, I didn't open it.

576
00:38:53,835 --> 00:38:55,086
Why did you come here then?

577
00:38:57,172 --> 00:38:59,966
Someone I know calls me their brother.

578
00:39:01,384 --> 00:39:04,888
That person is really smart
and persistent.

579
00:39:06,848 --> 00:39:10,435
The only place I can stay hidden
from that person is here.

580
00:39:24,407 --> 00:39:25,283
Hey.

581
00:39:26,201 --> 00:39:27,619
Bring some peanuts to room nine.

582
00:39:29,538 --> 00:39:30,872
Do you need anything else?

583
00:39:31,456 --> 00:39:32,874
Let me use this room for a few days.

584
00:39:35,126 --> 00:39:36,419
I'm on vacation,

585
00:39:38,171 --> 00:39:39,631
but I have nowhere to go.

586
00:39:39,714 --> 00:39:42,676
If you're on vacation,
just go somewhere nice and warm!

587
00:39:43,718 --> 00:39:45,220
Damn it.

588
00:39:46,721 --> 00:39:47,639
My gosh.

589
00:39:48,515 --> 00:39:49,349
Where are you going?

590
00:39:50,058 --> 00:39:51,142
To church.

591
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,561
For evening service.

592
00:39:53,311 --> 00:39:55,480
Why can't you just ask me
for money instead!

593
00:39:56,314 --> 00:39:57,232
Damn it.

594
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:15,333
JO YEONG

595
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,012
Who's the one who said,

596
00:40:27,596 --> 00:40:30,056
"Yeong is simple, and I'm good at math"

597
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:34,185
and told me to bring his laptop as if
he could find out the password right away?

598
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:37,480
It may seem like I'm having a hard time
unlocking it, but it's a misunderstanding.

599
00:40:38,315 --> 00:40:40,108
I'm just checking
the court's security levels.

600
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:42,319
Yeah, right.

601
00:40:43,236 --> 00:40:46,323
But what's in it? Why are you
making such a fuss to unlock it?

602
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:53,997
Your Majesty, Prime Minister Koo is here.

603
00:40:59,294 --> 00:41:00,378
The end-of-year report.

604
00:41:02,005 --> 00:41:03,548
Is it that time of year already?

605
00:41:03,632 --> 00:41:05,634
Yes. A year passed by so quickly.

606
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,469
Do you want anything
for a late-night snack?

607
00:41:08,094 --> 00:41:09,012
Sweet potatoes.

608
00:41:09,095 --> 00:41:10,680
I'm on a diet right now.

609
00:41:11,932 --> 00:41:12,849
I'll be off, then.

610
00:41:16,186 --> 00:41:17,103
Hello, Your Majesty.

611
00:41:19,064 --> 00:41:19,940
Welcome.

612
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,194
We have heightened
the security at the palace.

613
00:41:24,277 --> 00:41:26,112
Captain Jo will be with us the whole time.

614
00:41:27,322 --> 00:41:28,281
As you already know,

615
00:41:28,365 --> 00:41:31,409
we'll be staying up all night since
I'm receiving a year's worth of reports.

616
00:41:32,953 --> 00:41:33,912
Yes, Your Majesty.

617
00:41:35,372 --> 00:41:37,207
Sin-jae? He didn't come here.

618
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:40,043
Didn't he go to work?
Why are you looking for him here?

619
00:41:41,753 --> 00:41:42,921
That's classified information.

620
00:41:44,255 --> 00:41:46,883
Just call me if he comes here.

621
00:41:47,467 --> 00:41:49,010
Okay. But Tae-eul,

622
00:41:50,553 --> 00:41:51,429
isn't Eun-sup

623
00:41:53,014 --> 00:41:54,057
acting strange these days?

624
00:41:59,688 --> 00:42:01,231
Eun-sup? Why?

625
00:42:01,314 --> 00:42:03,358
I didn't notice anything weird.

626
00:42:03,441 --> 00:42:04,317
It feels like

627
00:42:05,068 --> 00:42:06,945
he's not as handsome as before.

628
00:42:07,737 --> 00:42:09,030
He looks a bit lame.

629
00:42:10,115 --> 00:42:11,825
What's up with his hair?

630
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,080
You really have a strange taste.

631
00:42:23,128 --> 00:42:25,213
Let's meet at the hotel from now on.

632
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,300
Na-ri and Eun-sup are going to
fall apart at this rate.

633
00:42:30,552 --> 00:42:31,386
What do you want?

634
00:42:35,682 --> 00:42:36,850
Can you sell this for me?

635
00:42:37,017 --> 00:42:38,977
I heard you know a decent place
that pays you well.

636
00:42:42,605 --> 00:42:43,690
Yeah, I do.

637
00:42:45,275 --> 00:42:49,070
I've been selling so much stuff
that the owner thinks I'm a corrupt cop.

638
00:42:50,321 --> 00:42:54,784
Anyway, I'll sell this for you,
so let me use the hotel room too.

639
00:42:55,493 --> 00:42:57,704
-I need a place of my own.
-His Majesty isn't in there...

640
00:42:57,787 --> 00:42:58,747
You're here.

641
00:42:59,914 --> 00:43:03,501
But what do you want to get
with the money from selling this?

642
00:43:04,711 --> 00:43:05,879
I need revenue

643
00:43:06,713 --> 00:43:08,006
to gain mobility.

644
00:43:14,054 --> 00:43:15,055
DRIVING TEST VEHICLE

645
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:19,100
<i>The driving test will begin now.</i>

646
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:21,936
<i>-You don't have a license?
-Congratulations. You have passed.</i>

647
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,564
SOCIAL SECURITY CARD
DRIVER'S LICENSE

648
00:43:25,148 --> 00:43:26,816
I took the test.

649
00:43:27,025 --> 00:43:29,194
I usually pass any kind of test I take.

650
00:43:29,694 --> 00:43:30,862
I got perfect scores on CSAT.

651
00:43:30,945 --> 00:43:32,447
I don't know what that is,

652
00:43:32,781 --> 00:43:34,949
but why don't you have a license
when you took the test?

653
00:43:35,533 --> 00:43:37,035
Because I couldn't turn right or left.

654
00:43:38,244 --> 00:43:39,829
A man should always go straight.

655
00:43:42,165 --> 00:43:43,249
I have a good enough reason.

656
00:43:44,292 --> 00:43:47,504
But why are you trying to go
when you can't even turn left or right?

657
00:43:47,754 --> 00:43:50,298
If you're thinking of it as
an overseas trip, you better stop.

658
00:43:50,381 --> 00:43:51,841
You'll get caught when you open...

659
00:43:56,096 --> 00:43:57,722
Should I just rip your throat?

660
00:43:58,389 --> 00:43:59,682
If you lose your voice...

661
00:43:59,766 --> 00:44:00,600
Hey!

662
00:44:04,979 --> 00:44:05,814
Hey.

663
00:44:06,815 --> 00:44:08,691
I know you care about King Arthur,

664
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,902
but you won't be as sincere as I am
for my siblings.

665
00:44:14,197 --> 00:44:15,698
Well, King Arthur told me

666
00:44:17,992 --> 00:44:19,953
that this is how
I can protect my siblings.

667
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:28,002
Are you doing well, Jo Eun-sup?

668
00:44:32,132 --> 00:44:34,175
If we're to maintain the budget
for education,

669
00:44:34,509 --> 00:44:36,761
we need drastic changes
for the medical sector.

670
00:44:41,808 --> 00:44:43,059
Do we really need to choose one?

671
00:44:43,143 --> 00:44:45,353
The department is stating that
we need to lower the welfare budget

672
00:44:45,436 --> 00:44:48,273
and increase the budget for
factors such as technology and service.

673
00:44:49,107 --> 00:44:50,024
For national interest.

674
00:44:50,108 --> 00:44:53,444
Medical service and education
are the people's rights, not benefits.

675
00:44:54,362 --> 00:44:55,363
Let's move on.

676
00:44:58,116 --> 00:44:59,576
There's a supplementary budget

677
00:44:59,659 --> 00:45:01,953
of 5.2 trillion won for restoring
the disaster area.

678
00:45:02,036 --> 00:45:04,122
Yes, it's been designated
as a special disaster zone

679
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:07,333
and we're doing our best to restore
and help people to live their daily lives.

680
00:45:07,709 --> 00:45:08,668
Great.

681
00:45:11,421 --> 00:45:14,757
Did that traveler return safely?

682
00:45:14,841 --> 00:45:16,050
Is work boring?

683
00:45:19,012 --> 00:45:21,681
She returned to her daily life.

684
00:45:28,271 --> 00:45:30,607
DONGNAE PENITENTIARY

685
00:45:32,692 --> 00:45:34,944
I hope she had a good time
in the Kingdom of Corea.

686
00:45:42,202 --> 00:45:44,454
I'm much more productive
after I eat something spicy.

687
00:45:44,871 --> 00:45:45,830
I work faster, too.

688
00:45:47,582 --> 00:45:48,917
Yeong, let's eat.

689
00:45:53,755 --> 00:45:56,007
Wow, how can you sweet potatoes
for every meal?

690
00:45:59,427 --> 00:46:00,762
Effort never betrays you.

691
00:46:03,514 --> 00:46:05,391
You need kimchi with sweet potatoes.

692
00:46:05,892 --> 00:46:08,478
DELICIOUS KIMCHI

693
00:46:13,441 --> 00:46:14,817
Do you know about this combination?

694
00:46:16,277 --> 00:46:18,071
Head Court Lady Noh
always gave these to me.

695
00:46:23,785 --> 00:46:24,911
It's really tasty.

696
00:46:26,162 --> 00:46:27,038
Yeong.

697
00:46:27,789 --> 00:46:28,915
Let's hurry up and eat.

698
00:46:30,041 --> 00:46:31,125
Yes, Your Majesty.

699
00:46:33,378 --> 00:46:34,712
Why aren't you eating?

700
00:46:35,338 --> 00:46:37,423
I'll gain weight
if I eat three times a day.

701
00:46:38,132 --> 00:46:39,717
Aren't you getting married, Your Majesty?

702
00:46:41,844 --> 00:46:43,513
That was a rather random question.

703
00:46:44,097 --> 00:46:44,931
Why?

704
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,892
-Do you want to marry me?
-Can I?

705
00:46:48,476 --> 00:46:49,394
No.

706
00:46:49,894 --> 00:46:51,896
I already proposed to someone else.

707
00:46:53,564 --> 00:46:54,983
What's the next agenda?

708
00:46:56,276 --> 00:46:57,360
<i>Wow.</i>

709
00:46:57,443 --> 00:46:59,362
<i>This world is very aggressive.</i>

710
00:47:03,449 --> 00:47:05,285
I told you, we're closed for today.

711
00:47:05,368 --> 00:47:07,036
You need to make an appointment first.

712
00:47:07,453 --> 00:47:09,580
He's here for me. You can go home now.

713
00:47:10,164 --> 00:47:10,999
All right.

714
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:17,046
I guess the sweets aren't helping.

715
00:47:18,006 --> 00:47:20,383
Or have you just realized
that they don't help?

716
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:22,010
Have a seat.

717
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:24,595
I want to get some sleep.

718
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:27,181
Can I get a prescription?

719
00:47:27,265 --> 00:47:28,891
Not without an examination.

720
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,144
Don't turn me into a real quack
and just sit down.

721
00:47:31,644 --> 00:47:34,605
I'm not the type that goes on
about your subconscious or whatever,

722
00:47:34,689 --> 00:47:35,940
so don't worry.

723
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:40,403
I believe a quick diagnosis
and the right medication is better.

724
00:47:40,486 --> 00:47:41,446
Like a cold.

725
00:47:42,447 --> 00:47:44,198
Can't you just introduce me to a quack?

726
00:47:44,907 --> 00:47:46,701
I came here because
even alcohol isn't helping.

727
00:47:46,784 --> 00:47:47,869
Are you sure?

728
00:47:48,578 --> 00:47:49,954
Maybe you just didn't drink enough.

729
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,459
Are you sure you're a real doctor?

730
00:47:58,921 --> 00:48:00,256
Wow.

731
00:48:00,798 --> 00:48:01,799
This is amazing.

732
00:48:13,144 --> 00:48:13,978
Wow.

733
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,456
Eun-sup?

734
00:48:36,334 --> 00:48:37,210
Take that off.

735
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:39,879
The King never shares his belongings
with other people.

736
00:48:41,631 --> 00:48:43,216
Damn, you're so cheap.

737
00:48:43,508 --> 00:48:45,051
I wanted to get some skincare, too.

738
00:48:49,597 --> 00:48:50,431
By the way,

739
00:48:51,724 --> 00:48:53,643
how did you unlock Yeong's cell phone?

740
00:48:56,729 --> 00:48:57,605
Like this.

741
00:49:02,068 --> 00:49:04,529
Have you still not unlocked his laptop?

742
00:49:04,695 --> 00:49:05,947
Should I give it a try?

743
00:49:07,448 --> 00:49:08,908
I appreciate your sense of challenge.

744
00:49:09,409 --> 00:49:12,120
But security in the Royal Court
isn't something that simple.

745
00:49:13,037 --> 00:49:14,330
Wake me if you do unlock it.

746
00:49:14,831 --> 00:49:16,040
Then I'll give you one too.

747
00:49:16,582 --> 00:49:18,501
This is a special skincare product

748
00:49:19,127 --> 00:49:21,045
made especially for the King.

749
00:49:35,268 --> 00:49:36,310
I unlocked it.

750
00:49:41,023 --> 00:49:42,608
<i>J, and then 13 zeros.</i>

751
00:49:42,692 --> 00:49:45,111
<i>One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,</i>

752
00:49:45,194 --> 00:49:47,989
<i>nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
And another zero.</i>

753
00:49:48,072 --> 00:49:49,740
<i>"Jo" as in trillion,
and "Yeong" as in zero.</i>

754
00:51:27,129 --> 00:51:29,966
We didn't take any photos together.

755
00:51:33,928 --> 00:51:35,471
<i>It's too cold outside now.</i>

756
00:51:36,514 --> 00:51:37,890
You should grow here from now on.

757
00:51:39,016 --> 00:51:39,934
What did you plant?

758
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:42,937
Seeds I got from your world.

759
00:51:43,854 --> 00:51:44,939
But it's not sprouting.

760
00:51:45,898 --> 00:51:46,941
Is it being shy?

761
00:51:50,444 --> 00:51:51,445
Listen up.

762
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,239
I am your King.

763
00:51:54,365 --> 00:51:56,033
I order you to grow well.

764
00:51:57,618 --> 00:51:59,620
I order you to sprout and bloom

765
00:52:00,955 --> 00:52:03,624
in the garden of the woman I like.
It's a King's Order.

766
00:52:06,127 --> 00:52:09,547
And you're still saying
that it's your first time dating?

767
00:52:10,381 --> 00:52:13,092
Of course. That statement is never
going to change until the next life.

768
00:52:16,095 --> 00:52:20,224
The seeds I scattered
in that strange place...

769
00:52:20,725 --> 00:52:22,685
Didn't they sprout?

770
00:52:24,312 --> 00:52:25,313
I told you.

771
00:52:26,063 --> 00:52:29,275
There's no wind, sunlight, or time there.

772
00:52:30,693 --> 00:52:31,694
I was just asking.

773
00:52:34,655 --> 00:52:36,157
Did you try going to the edge?

774
00:52:36,907 --> 00:52:40,036
I tried to, but I couldn't reach the edge.

775
00:52:40,661 --> 00:52:42,079
I shouldn't stay there long.

776
00:52:42,663 --> 00:52:43,956
Even if I spend one day in there,

777
00:52:44,957 --> 00:52:46,334
two months flow by outside.

778
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:48,294
Then

779
00:52:48,878 --> 00:52:50,671
if you're in there, you won't grow old.

780
00:52:53,507 --> 00:52:54,342
Hang on.

781
00:52:56,844 --> 00:52:58,679
Then I could actually be older than you.

782
00:53:00,139 --> 00:53:03,225
No wonder. You seemed to be
getting younger these days.

783
00:53:04,769 --> 00:53:06,354
Even if I can have eternal life in there,

784
00:53:06,854 --> 00:53:08,105
I'll come to you.

785
00:53:09,065 --> 00:53:11,359
If I'm late, it's because I'm on my way.

786
00:53:13,569 --> 00:53:16,030
Don't think about coming to me.
Think about going together.

787
00:53:16,322 --> 00:53:18,032
Don't go somewhere nice without me.

788
00:53:33,089 --> 00:53:35,049
I think I'm going to miss you so much.

789
00:53:37,551 --> 00:53:38,386
Can't you

790
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:41,180
come with me?

791
00:53:43,891 --> 00:53:45,101
Can't you live with me

792
00:53:47,395 --> 00:53:48,813
in my world?

793
00:53:52,775 --> 00:53:55,486
I'm adding one more of the 17 things.

794
00:53:58,531 --> 00:54:00,032
Don't ask me to come with you.

795
00:54:02,076 --> 00:54:03,494
What about this world?

796
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:05,621
What about my dad?

797
00:54:05,955 --> 00:54:06,831
And Na-ri,

798
00:54:07,623 --> 00:54:08,624
and the station?

799
00:54:09,792 --> 00:54:11,377
Saying that just puts me in a tight spot.

800
00:54:17,883 --> 00:54:18,718
What was that?

801
00:54:19,343 --> 00:54:21,595
-Did you just stop me from talking?
-No, I stopped myself.

802
00:54:23,097 --> 00:54:24,807
This is what we do when we have

803
00:54:25,766 --> 00:54:26,726
too many things to say.

804
00:54:27,476 --> 00:54:28,644
That's the law in...

805
00:54:32,565 --> 00:54:34,191
I have to follow the law.

806
00:54:34,275 --> 00:54:35,651
I'm a civil servant, you know.

807
00:55:04,054 --> 00:55:05,014
I'm seeing

808
00:55:06,932 --> 00:55:08,642
something beautiful again.

809
00:56:25,135 --> 00:56:26,053
What?

810
00:56:31,016 --> 00:56:32,226
Was I mistaken?

811
00:56:38,649 --> 00:56:40,025
Haesong Bookstore,

812
00:56:40,484 --> 00:56:42,987
May 27, 2022.

813
00:56:43,821 --> 00:56:47,491
2022...

814
00:56:52,746 --> 00:56:53,831
Is it an error?

815
00:56:59,712 --> 00:57:01,171
Tae-eul wasn't

816
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:03,424
wearing that on that day.

817
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:08,971
What is this?

818
00:57:29,033 --> 00:57:31,368
Did you retrieve the cell phone?

819
00:57:33,203 --> 00:57:34,288
I'm on it.

820
00:57:35,122 --> 00:57:36,999
I've been investigating
other stuff these days.

821
00:57:42,087 --> 00:57:45,007
You know, Kang Sin-jae.

822
00:57:45,966 --> 00:57:48,886
I heard that he went to see
Song Jeong-hye's son at the cinerarium.

823
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:52,222
And the cop that visited
the care center before...

824
00:57:52,765 --> 00:57:54,558
It's a bitch named Jeong Tae-eul.

825
00:57:54,642 --> 00:57:57,311
I looked into it,
and she's the one who caught Jang Yeon-ji.

826
00:57:58,312 --> 00:57:59,688
She's looking for her phone, too.

827
00:58:00,564 --> 00:58:01,732
Kang Sin-jae...

828
00:58:02,983 --> 00:58:04,610
The wrong move I made.

829
00:58:06,236 --> 00:58:07,446
And Jeong Tae-eul,

830
00:58:09,573 --> 00:58:11,408
the move I didn't make.

831
00:58:11,951 --> 00:58:14,036
Don't worry. I'll find it first.

832
00:58:14,995 --> 00:58:17,665
Should I just bury them both somewhere?

833
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,428
Just get rid of Jang Yeon-ji,

834
00:58:31,929 --> 00:58:34,640
and don't do anything else.

835
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:37,351
I need to leave again.

836
00:58:40,771 --> 00:58:44,358
I think my nephew will know by now.

837
00:58:53,951 --> 00:58:56,453
That bookstore you asked me
to find, Your Majesty...

838
00:58:57,037 --> 00:59:00,207
There is no Haesong Bookstore
registered anywhere in this Kingdom.

839
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:05,004
I looked online, and even through
used bookstores, but there's nothing.

840
00:59:06,422 --> 00:59:07,631
And this.

841
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:11,635
I got all the security footage
of the event you asked for.

842
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:14,513
Good job.

843
00:59:15,139 --> 00:59:16,348
Keep looking for the bookstore.

844
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:18,809
Look for ones
that closed in the past, too.

845
00:59:18,892 --> 00:59:20,811
Yes, Your Majesty.

846
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:34,533
<i>Back then, he was in
the Republic of Korea.</i>

847
00:59:36,285 --> 00:59:37,494
<i>So if the time stops again,</i>

848
00:59:39,496 --> 00:59:40,748
<i>he's in the Kingdom of Corea.</i>

849
00:59:49,506 --> 00:59:50,799
We're closed today.

850
00:59:54,178 --> 00:59:55,387
I'm sorry.

851
00:59:57,097 --> 00:59:59,058
The door was open.

852
01:00:00,392 --> 01:00:02,019
Yes. I'm waiting for a delivery.

853
01:00:02,853 --> 01:00:05,355
If there's anything you're looking for,
I'll get it for you.

854
01:00:05,439 --> 01:00:06,607
Oh, it's all right.

855
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:11,278
I was just thinking of looking
at medical books if you have any.

856
01:00:12,571 --> 01:00:14,406
We don't have medical books here.

857
01:00:14,615 --> 01:00:16,033
Nobody comes looking for them.

858
01:00:16,116 --> 01:00:17,409
Oh, I see.

859
01:00:19,745 --> 01:00:20,579
But

860
01:00:21,663 --> 01:00:24,541
have we met before?

861
01:00:32,216 --> 01:00:33,759
I've seen you.

862
01:00:34,885 --> 01:00:36,261
You're a member of the royal family.

863
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:39,973
Sometimes I forget that.

864
01:00:40,516 --> 01:00:41,934
Sorry for the trouble.

865
01:01:08,335 --> 01:01:12,339
You come here every year
without telling me in advance.

866
01:01:12,422 --> 01:01:17,261
Because you're here every year
as if we've made a promise.

867
01:01:20,681 --> 01:01:22,808
Have you found any answers yet?

868
01:01:23,433 --> 01:01:24,977
I found a symbol,

869
01:01:26,353 --> 01:01:28,939
but I'm having trouble with it
because the solution isn't good.

870
01:01:29,439 --> 01:01:31,900
I'm sure you will be able to solve it.

871
01:01:32,234 --> 01:01:34,153
You've always done so.

872
01:01:35,279 --> 01:01:36,405
Uncle,

873
01:01:38,157 --> 01:01:39,741
do you believe in fate?

874
01:01:43,245 --> 01:01:46,540
It's a hard concept
for a math and science person.

875
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:48,917
It's not something clear.

876
01:01:49,585 --> 01:01:53,839
People usually tell fate to move aside
and challenge it.

877
01:01:56,633 --> 01:01:57,885
Should I fight against it?

878
01:01:58,677 --> 01:02:01,972
You can never know
what will happen in life.

879
01:02:03,182 --> 01:02:05,350
But if there is a place you want to reach

880
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:07,394
even if

881
01:02:08,187 --> 01:02:10,439
your life may be at risk,

882
01:02:10,689 --> 01:02:12,608
that is fate.

883
01:02:13,525 --> 01:02:16,153
The footsteps you take

884
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:23,368
by risking your whole life is what's fate.

885
01:02:28,081 --> 01:02:30,918
Is there a place you want to reach?

886
01:02:32,628 --> 01:02:33,503
Yes.

887
01:02:34,046 --> 01:02:34,963
There is.

888
01:02:35,214 --> 01:02:38,717
Then you just have to go there.
You don't need to fight.

889
01:02:39,801 --> 01:02:42,971
I hope there is a beautiful lady there.

890
01:02:44,389 --> 01:02:46,725
You should really get married this year.

891
01:02:48,602 --> 01:02:49,853
If I find the solution,

892
01:02:51,396 --> 01:02:55,984
I will visit you again with a woman
who argues that the earth is flat.

893
01:02:56,068 --> 01:02:57,027
All right.

894
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:58,987
I will be waiting, Your Majesty.

895
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:05,702
It's the first sunrise of the new year.

896
01:03:33,313 --> 01:03:34,523
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul,

897
01:03:36,149 --> 01:03:37,401
happy New Year.

898
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:54,459
<i>Lee Lim</i>

899
01:03:56,461 --> 01:03:58,588
<i>has finally come over
to the Kingdom of Corea.</i>

900
01:04:01,883 --> 01:04:05,178
HAPPY NEW YEAR 2020

901
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:31,788
It's the King!

902
01:05:07,282 --> 01:05:08,283
<i>I'm sure</i>

903
01:05:09,534 --> 01:05:11,453
<i>he is watching me.</i>

904
01:05:17,709 --> 01:05:18,877
<i>But he isn't in the videos.</i>

905
01:05:21,755 --> 01:05:22,631
<i>Why?</i>

906
01:06:11,596 --> 01:06:13,181
<i>What have I missed?</i>

907
01:06:22,274 --> 01:06:23,150
<i>Then</i>

908
01:06:23,692 --> 01:06:25,652
<i>if you're in there, you won't grow old.</i>

909
01:06:40,625 --> 01:06:41,543
This

910
01:06:44,671 --> 01:06:45,839
doesn't make sense.

911
01:06:54,139 --> 01:06:54,973
No way.

912
01:06:55,056 --> 01:06:55,974
<i>He's...</i>

913
01:06:57,058 --> 01:06:59,269
<i>delaying time inside that place.</i>

914
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:04,334
<i>Someone who does not age.</i>

915
01:08:07,045 --> 01:08:08,588
<i>A near-immortal life.</i>

916
01:08:10,924 --> 01:08:12,342
<i>That is what you want</i>

917
01:08:13,176 --> 01:08:14,177
<i>to achieve.</i>

918
01:08:16,346 --> 01:08:17,430
<i>Eternity.</i>

919
01:08:21,226 --> 01:08:22,310
Traitor,

920
01:08:25,522 --> 01:08:26,856
Lee Lim!

922
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,209
<i>"Traitor Lee Lim." Is this true?</i>

923
01:09:28,293 --> 01:09:30,420
<i>You're still alive.</i>

924
01:09:30,503 --> 01:09:32,714
I'm looking forward
to the next time we meet.

925
01:09:32,797 --> 01:09:34,257
<i>Those with the same faces...</i>

926
01:09:34,341 --> 01:09:36,509
<i>The other day, you asked me
how far I've gone.</i>

927
01:09:36,593 --> 01:09:37,969
<i>...are stealing...</i>

928
01:09:38,053 --> 01:09:40,597
<i>I tried calling his name.
The name that I remembered.</i>

929
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:41,765
<i>...their counterparts' lives.</i>

930
01:09:41,848 --> 01:09:42,682
Lee Gon.

931
01:09:42,766 --> 01:09:44,601
<i>Is there something going on
that I don't know?</i>

932
01:09:44,684 --> 01:09:46,394
<i>Can you really do it?</i>

933
01:09:46,478 --> 01:09:51,066
<i>And for some people, it gives them
the courage to face their fate.</i>

934
01:09:52,067 --> 01:09:53,276
Prince Imperial Geum.

935
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:55,403
<i>Can you really
abandon everything in this world</i>

936
01:09:56,029 --> 01:09:58,782
<i>and become the Queen
of the Kingdom of Corea?</i>
