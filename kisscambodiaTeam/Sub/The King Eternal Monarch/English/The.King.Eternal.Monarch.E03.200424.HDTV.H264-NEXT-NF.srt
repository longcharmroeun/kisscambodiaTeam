THE KING: ETERNAL MONARCH

2
00:00:05,073 --> 00:00:07,492
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:09,995
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:11,437 --> 00:00:13,148
EPISODE 3

5
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,917
SIN-JAE...

6
00:00:45,221 --> 00:00:47,724
She should tell us
if she's going to be late.

7
00:00:47,807 --> 00:00:48,683
She's making us wait.

8
00:00:50,393 --> 00:00:52,395
The good parts like the drumsticks
and wings

9
00:00:52,478 --> 00:00:55,481
should be eaten while they're crispy
on the outside and soft on the inside.

10
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:58,359
<i>Sin-jae, just drink with Eun-sup today.</i>

11
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,862
<i>I have something to take care of.</i>

12
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:04,240
Eat up. She says she can't come.

13
00:01:06,743 --> 00:01:08,036
Give us a bottle of soju, please.

14
00:01:09,412 --> 00:01:10,622
Hang on.

15
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,166
Tae-eul really refused chicken and beer?

16
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:17,128
What's going on?

17
00:01:17,212 --> 00:01:18,504
That's unbelievable.

18
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:22,592
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

19
00:01:25,053 --> 00:01:26,012
I take you

20
00:01:26,596 --> 00:01:27,931
to be my wife, the Queen.

21
00:01:29,182 --> 00:01:30,808
You just became the reason.

22
00:01:31,851 --> 00:01:33,061
The reason

23
00:01:33,937 --> 00:01:35,230
why I should stay in this world.

24
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:39,609
Did you say "queen"?

25
00:01:40,026 --> 00:01:41,110
Why?

26
00:01:41,444 --> 00:01:43,696
Did I look cool over the last few days?

27
00:01:43,905 --> 00:01:46,741
You've gone so mad
that your brain turned 360 degrees.

28
00:01:46,991 --> 00:01:49,410
If you are referring
to the angle of rotation,

29
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:50,787
a 360-degree turn means
that my brain is in its original position.

30
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,581
Oh, right. It should've been 180 degrees.

31
00:01:54,207 --> 00:01:55,083
So?

32
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:56,960
Are you saying you really mean it?

33
00:01:57,043 --> 00:01:59,045
I've just given you a whole world.

34
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,132
I don't know
how I can be any more sincere.

35
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:05,343
Oh, I just received a whole world.

36
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:07,679
Right, I guess that's a good item

37
00:02:07,762 --> 00:02:10,390
to be giving back and forth
on the street while going to eat chicken.

38
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,558
Are you crazy?

39
00:02:17,397 --> 00:02:18,731
Among real numbers,

40
00:02:19,274 --> 00:02:20,483
zero is my favorite.

41
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:22,110
You have the nature of that number.

42
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,528
Do I?

43
00:02:23,736 --> 00:02:25,113
Who would have known?

44
00:02:25,738 --> 00:02:27,907
Usually, a zero means
that there is nothing,

45
00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:30,785
but it's actually
a number of absolute power.

46
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,997
It can nullify any number
or take everything away from it.

47
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:37,292
What makes money powerful
is not the number at the front,

48
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,127
but the number of zeros behind it.

49
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:42,922
A number trapped
in a root symbol can escape

50
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,008
under only two circumstances.

51
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:49,679
They need to have a square root
or meet the powerful number, zero.

52
00:02:51,514 --> 00:02:54,517
You're always busy,
and you don't care much for me.

53
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,312
Because of you, I'm powerless here,

54
00:02:58,354 --> 00:02:59,522
but it's fine.

55
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,277
You are much more amazing
than I had imagined.

56
00:03:04,777 --> 00:03:06,571
And you're standing
in front of the root symbol

57
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:09,115
I'm trapped in.

58
00:03:12,744 --> 00:03:14,662
You asked if I meant it. That's my answer.

59
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,706
Do you believe me now?

60
00:03:18,124 --> 00:03:19,292
Believe what?

61
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:25,381
I was asking if you really
mean to keep talking nonsense.

62
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:29,427
You're as slow-witted

63
00:03:30,261 --> 00:03:31,137
as a bear.

64
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,388
A bear?

65
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:34,807
A bear?

66
00:03:34,891 --> 00:03:37,810
Oh, are you insulting me
since you have nothing to say?

67
00:03:38,186 --> 00:03:42,398
Would it be okay for a king
to marry some random bear?

68
00:03:42,482 --> 00:03:44,317
They would oppose a marriage with a bear.

69
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,403
The court and the cabinet
would all oppose strongly.

70
00:03:48,738 --> 00:03:49,822
All right, let's go.

71
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:50,948
Let's go there.

72
00:03:51,157 --> 00:03:53,201
Take me to this
parallel universe of yours.

73
00:03:53,326 --> 00:03:55,870
I'll go and proclaim myself
the mother of the people.

74
00:03:56,496 --> 00:03:58,122
Lead the way. Which way is it?

75
00:03:58,706 --> 00:03:59,874
Come on, lead the way.

76
00:04:25,817 --> 00:04:26,692
What is it?

77
00:04:27,151 --> 00:04:29,862
Is this the wrong address
of the doorway to your world?

78
00:04:30,905 --> 00:04:33,032
If you have to recite
a spell or something, do it.

79
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:34,492
No need to feel embarrassed.

80
00:04:35,284 --> 00:04:36,285
I'm looking for the door.

81
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:39,664
But it's not opening
since I came empty-handed.

82
00:04:40,665 --> 00:04:43,418
I guess we should've brought something.

83
00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:45,461
Are you kidding me?

84
00:04:46,462 --> 00:04:47,839
I know it's hard to believe,

85
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:51,592
but there should be two obelisks there.

86
00:04:52,677 --> 00:04:54,720
Your lies are getting
more and more detailed.

87
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:57,390
You mean the rocks in temples?

88
00:04:58,015 --> 00:05:01,978
Yes. The obelisks that stand between
the world of gods and humans.

89
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:06,232
<i>I heard a flute,
then came thunder and lightning,</i>

90
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:09,068
<i>and two large obelisks appeared.</i>

91
00:05:10,987 --> 00:05:13,948
But I guess I'm not allowed
to use that door today.

92
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,207
Are you bored or something?

93
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:27,086
Why did you come here
when you're not allowed?

94
00:05:27,211 --> 00:05:29,839
I needed to check once anyway,

95
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,884
but you told me to lead the way,
so it was a good chance.

96
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:36,429
What did I do to deserve this?

97
00:05:36,512 --> 00:05:40,266
Why am I talking such nonsense with him
when it's freezing cold right now?

98
00:05:41,476 --> 00:05:42,727
Mr. Kim Gae-ddong.

99
00:05:44,937 --> 00:05:45,897
Listen to me carefully.

100
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:49,901
Your DNA results will probably
come out by tomorrow.

101
00:05:50,943 --> 00:05:52,945
It will be a relief
if we find a relative of yours,

102
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:54,864
but even if we don't,

103
00:05:55,615 --> 00:05:57,575
this is as much as I can do to help.

104
00:05:58,951 --> 00:06:01,746
And stop calling Eun-sup. Got that?

105
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:02,872
Did he agree to that?

106
00:06:02,955 --> 00:06:05,917
He's government property,
so he doesn't have a free will.

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,253
Would Eun-sup and Yeong
really have the same DNA?

108
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:12,423
Even twins don't have the exact same DNA.

109
00:06:12,507 --> 00:06:14,509
So even if you find a relative
based on my DNA,

110
00:06:15,384 --> 00:06:16,761
they won't be my real family.

111
00:06:18,262 --> 00:06:21,891
Why would a relative not be your family?

112
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,896
My mother and father passed away
a long time ago.

113
00:06:28,606 --> 00:06:30,066
Ironically, the first duty of a king

114
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:32,276
is carrying out
the funeral of the former king.

115
00:06:33,194 --> 00:06:34,237
It was when I was eight.

116
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:43,996
That's a long time ago.

117
00:06:45,331 --> 00:06:46,290
Shall we go now?

118
00:07:36,465 --> 00:07:37,592
What's his name?

119
00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:40,678
You're an only child
but you call him your brother.

120
00:07:42,221 --> 00:07:43,472
What's your name, then?

121
00:07:44,307 --> 00:07:47,018
Why ask another guy's name
when you don't even know yours?

122
00:07:47,184 --> 00:07:48,269
I never said I don't know.

123
00:07:48,894 --> 00:07:50,521
I said you can't say my name
even if I tell you.

124
00:07:51,856 --> 00:07:53,107
Are you the poet Kim So-wol?

125
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,109
Who's Kim So-wol?

126
00:07:56,193 --> 00:07:57,737
Wow, you're really good at pretending.

127
00:07:59,322 --> 00:08:03,242
I won't "finish the last words
I had in my heart,"

128
00:08:03,492 --> 00:08:05,494
so stop being nosy about my life.

129
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:14,670
Is that guy
really a huge part of your life?

130
00:08:15,755 --> 00:08:16,631
Hey!

131
00:08:26,515 --> 00:08:27,975
The five tenets of Taekwondo are

132
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:31,771
courtesy, perseverance, integrity,
self-control, and indomitable spirit.

133
00:08:32,355 --> 00:08:34,690
For people without black belts,
the forms are <i>Taeguk</i> 1 to 8.

134
00:08:34,774 --> 00:08:37,526
For people with black belts,
the forms are from <i>Koryo</i> to <i>Ilyeo</i>.

135
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,903
You're the Taekwondo master?

136
00:08:39,236 --> 00:08:42,490
As you can see, the road of learning
is a long and rough unpaved road.

137
00:08:42,573 --> 00:08:44,158
But there is no need to worry.

138
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:46,077
And I'll accompany you
to the end of that road,

139
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,162
so you'll show courtesy,
have perseverance,

140
00:08:48,245 --> 00:08:50,956
integrity, and self-control,
and eventually have an indomitable spirit.

141
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,209
-Is that black-belt real?
-Don't talk so casually to me.

142
00:08:53,918 --> 00:08:55,086
JEONG TAE-EUL

143
00:08:56,921 --> 00:08:58,172
I thought you had perseverance.

144
00:09:01,092 --> 00:09:02,426
Don't lower your guard.

145
00:09:03,094 --> 00:09:06,013
You're the one who needs
to learn perseverance, not me.

146
00:09:07,682 --> 00:09:10,059
It'll be a waste of money
to just lie there on the floor.

147
00:09:10,142 --> 00:09:12,728
Get up. You will learn breakfalls first.

148
00:09:12,812 --> 00:09:14,313
Let's just skip that.

149
00:09:15,773 --> 00:09:17,358
I fell thousands of times before.

150
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:20,361
And you'll keep falling in the future,

151
00:09:20,653 --> 00:09:23,406
so I'll teach you how to fall safely.

152
00:09:44,301 --> 00:09:45,177
Hey.

153
00:09:46,178 --> 00:09:48,139
Hey, that's prejudice.

154
00:09:48,222 --> 00:09:51,142
I just look a bit rough.
I'm not really a bad person.

155
00:09:56,105 --> 00:09:57,815
They must've been talking about you.

156
00:09:57,898 --> 00:09:59,775
You really are handsome.

157
00:10:01,277 --> 00:10:03,279
You don't have an ID, do you?

158
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:05,698
Hey.

159
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:07,616
Are you trying to attack me?

160
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:49,867
Your resume states

161
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:53,621
that your family is living
in Canada right now.

162
00:10:54,747 --> 00:10:56,165
Is your family wealthy?

163
00:10:56,415 --> 00:10:57,416
Pardon?

164
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:00,377
Oh, well...

165
00:11:00,628 --> 00:11:02,546
We didn't have any financial trouble.

166
00:11:03,172 --> 00:11:05,299
Then you won't do anything stupid
because of money.

167
00:11:06,217 --> 00:11:07,468
Do you have many friends?

168
00:11:07,551 --> 00:11:10,221
Well, it hasn't been long
since I came from Canada.

169
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:12,807
I only meet a childhood friend often.

170
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:15,851
Then you won't have many people
to tell about your work.

171
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:19,063
The reason why I'm hiring you is--

172
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:20,356
What?

173
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,774
I got the job?

174
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:23,692
So suddenly?

175
00:11:23,776 --> 00:11:25,653
It's not sudden.

176
00:11:25,736 --> 00:11:30,950
You've applied for 4 years,
and I've watched you for 4 years.

177
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:34,411
You've been watching me?

178
00:11:35,746 --> 00:11:36,580
How?

179
00:11:37,623 --> 00:11:39,291
Nickname Jogon Jogon.

180
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,585
I've enjoyed your fanfics.

181
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:45,631
I was happy
living in the world you created.

182
00:11:46,549 --> 00:11:51,512
I appreciate your ability to create
something from nothing,

183
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:54,765
so I will give you an important job.

184
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:58,811
Can you use After Effect and Photoshop?

185
00:11:58,894 --> 00:12:00,604
Wow, that's crazy.

186
00:12:02,898 --> 00:12:04,483
Sorry about that.

187
00:12:04,984 --> 00:12:07,403
I got a spot for you
at the Royal Public Affairs Office.

188
00:12:09,446 --> 00:12:13,284
I want you to just write like you used to.

189
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:17,830
Please write beautiful stories
and touching hashtags.

190
00:12:36,891 --> 00:12:41,729
HIS MAJESTY IS GROOMING
HANDSOMENESS STILL SHOWS BEHIND THE MASK

191
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:45,107
Head Court Lady Noh sure is working hard.

192
00:12:49,194 --> 00:12:50,070
<i>Prime Minister,</i>

193
00:12:51,113 --> 00:12:52,698
<i>are you honest?</i>

194
00:12:53,908 --> 00:12:56,869
Honesty is a privilege that only
the king can have

195
00:12:57,536 --> 00:13:00,080
since he doesn't need to care
about approval ratings.

196
00:13:01,123 --> 00:13:02,207
But I'm a politician.

197
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:05,961
I thank you on behalf of all the citizens

198
00:13:06,045 --> 00:13:08,005
for voluntarily deciding to pay taxes.

199
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:11,842
But as a politician,
I'm planning on using your honesty--

200
00:13:11,926 --> 00:13:15,471
I heard you vetoed the salary raise
of the Congress members.

201
00:13:17,806 --> 00:13:19,058
Do you think you can win?

202
00:13:19,892 --> 00:13:22,353
Am I going to be the Joker in that fight?

203
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:24,563
Don't you know what card you are?

204
00:13:25,147 --> 00:13:26,857
You're always the King, of course.

205
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:29,777
I'll do my best to win.

206
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:31,403
Just watch me, Your Majesty.

207
00:13:33,197 --> 00:13:34,365
I've always been watching.

208
00:13:35,366 --> 00:13:37,368
He said he'd watch, but he ran off?

209
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:38,452
Pardon?

210
00:13:38,661 --> 00:13:40,454
Is everyone attending the meeting today?

211
00:13:40,537 --> 00:13:41,455
Oh, yes.

212
00:13:41,872 --> 00:13:43,832
Since it's an agenda
that affects them personally,

213
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:47,002
even those on a business trip
returned this morning.

214
00:13:47,503 --> 00:13:50,297
They only start working hard
when their money is on the line.

215
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:57,096
It's the first time in three years
that a salary raise has been mentioned

216
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:00,557
since the discussion
at the last cabinet meeting.

217
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:02,643
Living expenses have risen since then,

218
00:14:02,935 --> 00:14:05,312
and it's natural to have
an increased rate based on that.

219
00:14:05,396 --> 00:14:06,772
But a veto?

220
00:14:07,022 --> 00:14:08,273
My goodness.

221
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:11,819
Aren't you a member of our party,
Prime Minister?

222
00:14:12,403 --> 00:14:13,821
Prime Minister,

223
00:14:13,904 --> 00:14:17,658
are you trying
to use our well-earned money

224
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:21,245
to maintain your own approval ratings?

225
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:24,289
I really didn't want to say this,

226
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:29,169
but don't you think that position
is too much for you?

227
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:36,135
I mean, the party helped you
gain that position

228
00:14:36,218 --> 00:14:39,304
by creating a favorable image for you.

229
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,975
But all you're doing
is putting on more makeup.

230
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,939
Mr. Park, if this position can be kept
by dressing up and putting on makeup,

231
00:14:49,898 --> 00:14:51,859
then you can dress up
and put on eyeliner as well.

232
00:14:51,942 --> 00:14:53,193
Look here, Prime Minister!

233
00:14:54,153 --> 00:14:55,154
COREA PARTY

234
00:14:56,572 --> 00:14:59,575
His Majesty has been paying taxes
voluntarily since last year.

235
00:15:00,993 --> 00:15:03,078
Don't you think we should
improve our party's image?

236
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:05,539
There are articles being written every day

237
00:15:05,622 --> 00:15:08,292
about the increasing gap between
high-income earners like politicians

238
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,668
and low-income earners.

239
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:13,130
Of course, postponing the salary raise
just once won't narrow the gap.

240
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:15,424
But we can show the citizens

241
00:15:16,425 --> 00:15:20,804
that our party's values
are clearly centered around them.

242
00:15:22,056 --> 00:15:25,100
If you understand why our party's
approval rating has been so low,

243
00:15:26,185 --> 00:15:28,604
please explain it
to the people next to you.

244
00:15:28,687 --> 00:15:30,189
Don't just keep it to yourself.

245
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:35,360
And one more thing.

246
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:40,115
I'm the Prime Minister
of the Kingdom of Corea.

247
00:15:40,783 --> 00:15:42,159
Not the representative of a party.

248
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:59,093
My mouth feels...

249
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,220
My mouth feels so fresh.

250
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:02,262
Chief.

251
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:05,265
What is it?

252
00:16:05,349 --> 00:16:08,477
I just heard from Administration that
they're seizing Sin-jae's salary again.

253
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,686
Again?

254
00:16:11,396 --> 00:16:13,107
You didn't say anything
to Sin-jae, did you?

255
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,859
I didn't. If I wanted to,
I would've gone to the office right away.

256
00:16:15,943 --> 00:16:18,195
-Why would I be here telling you about it?
-Good job.

257
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:21,615
Do you think his mother
still hasn't quit gambling?

258
00:16:21,824 --> 00:16:23,033
This is just unbelievable!

259
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:26,870
His mother grew up a bit spoiled
in a wealthy environment.

260
00:16:26,954 --> 00:16:28,539
She has no knowledge of the world.

261
00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:31,416
People enjoy gambling even
when they weren't spoiled.

262
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,918
It's so irritating.

263
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:35,420
What do we do about poor Sin-jae?

264
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,680
This is the list of junk dealers
in Eunpyeong, Seodaemun, and Jung-gu.

265
00:16:45,597 --> 00:16:50,269
I asked around in Seongbuk, Dongdaemun,
and Seongdong-gu, but there was nothing.

266
00:16:50,936 --> 00:16:53,397
Do I really have to investigate
junk dealers at my rank?

267
00:16:54,064 --> 00:16:56,400
When are we getting a new recruit?

268
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:57,401
This morning.

269
00:16:58,068 --> 00:16:58,944
It's the afternoon.

270
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:02,364
The sun's down already.

271
00:17:02,865 --> 00:17:07,119
I mean, he came to work real early,
so I sent him to Squad Two to help...

272
00:17:08,745 --> 00:17:09,830
Wow.

273
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:12,249
Is that our new recruit

274
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:13,959
who just caught a criminal?

275
00:17:42,738 --> 00:17:44,448
You look well-built. Nice.

276
00:17:45,324 --> 00:17:47,534
It's nice to see you, newbie.
Tell us your name.

277
00:17:47,618 --> 00:17:48,619
Yes!

278
00:17:49,661 --> 00:17:50,537
I'm Jang Michael.

279
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:52,497
Sit down, sir.

280
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:55,250
And answer
the detective's questions properly.

281
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:57,836
He's the detective.

282
00:18:00,505 --> 00:18:01,381
Hello!

283
00:18:01,965 --> 00:18:04,801
I'm Jang Michael, and I'll be working
with you starting today.

284
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:09,431
I really wanted to try wearing
a handcuff with a criminal I caught.

285
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:13,352
I won't do it again.

286
00:18:13,435 --> 00:18:14,728
Right, once is enough.

287
00:18:14,811 --> 00:18:16,688
Is there another dream you have?

288
00:18:16,897 --> 00:18:18,440
Even if you do, don't ever mention it.

289
00:18:18,523 --> 00:18:19,650
Yes, sir.

290
00:18:19,816 --> 00:18:20,692
But you...

291
00:18:20,776 --> 00:18:23,737
-What's your name again?
-It's Jang Michael.

292
00:18:24,071 --> 00:18:27,574
It's my baptismal name.
Just call me Jangmi.

293
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:30,077
My friends all call me that.

294
00:18:30,661 --> 00:18:32,537
Jangmi, as in "rose"? Wow.

295
00:18:32,621 --> 00:18:34,831
I'll send you our work manual,
so tell me your email address.

296
00:18:34,915 --> 00:18:35,791
Yes, sir.

297
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,626
It's rose93...

298
00:18:39,962 --> 00:18:42,422
Oh, I'm sorry. I mean...

299
00:18:43,173 --> 00:18:45,300
R, O, S...

300
00:18:45,384 --> 00:18:49,304
We weren't shocked at your
English skills, you know.

301
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:50,806
"Rose"?

302
00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:52,933
The "rose" part was fine with me,
but the 93 shocked me.

303
00:18:53,016 --> 00:18:54,643
Okay, just continue.

304
00:18:54,726 --> 00:18:55,936
Yes, sir.

305
00:18:56,353 --> 00:18:59,189
It's rose93@unicorn.net!

306
00:18:59,856 --> 00:19:03,068
I will do my best
with passion and a sense of duty!

307
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:04,820
I look forward to working with you!

308
00:19:05,821 --> 00:19:07,281
Wow, look at you.

309
00:19:07,864 --> 00:19:10,701
Passion and sense of duty?
That's too overwhelming.

310
00:19:10,784 --> 00:19:11,910
Let's get rid of one.

311
00:19:12,035 --> 00:19:13,328
It'll exhaust you, too.

312
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:17,124
Copy that list and follow
your seniors around with passion.

313
00:19:17,207 --> 00:19:19,209
-Yes, sir!
-You can drive a manual, right?

314
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:20,460
Oh, I'm sorry.

315
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:22,587
I was born in 1993, so...

316
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:25,465
Okay, I'll drive since I was born in 1987.

317
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:27,551
I'll drive, I was born in 1990.

318
00:19:49,072 --> 00:19:51,241
<i>A crowbar? You can look around.</i>

319
00:19:52,117 --> 00:19:55,746
<i>You can find scrap metal on the right.</i>

320
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:57,664
<i>There are some crowbars there.</i>

321
00:19:57,789 --> 00:19:59,333
<i>Is the weapon a crowbar this time?</i>

322
00:20:00,042 --> 00:20:01,877
<i>The world is so scary these days.</i>

323
00:20:03,795 --> 00:20:04,921
<i>You're lucky.</i>

324
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:08,216
<i>I didn't get enough scrap metal,
so I haven't sold them off yet.</i>

325
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,593
<i>You can dig around freely.</i>

326
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:13,347
Let's go.

327
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,612
Ms. Jeong! Mr. Kang!

328
00:20:29,112 --> 00:20:31,698
I found it! I think I found it!

329
00:20:32,115 --> 00:20:33,367
What?

330
00:20:36,161 --> 00:20:39,331
The blood. This is it, right?

331
00:20:39,414 --> 00:20:40,499
I think it's the weapon.

332
00:20:40,582 --> 00:20:41,666
Are you a shaman or what?

333
00:20:42,376 --> 00:20:44,920
We'll hand it to the Forensics team.
You two take care of the rest.

334
00:20:45,003 --> 00:20:46,963
What do you mean? You should join us.

335
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:49,174
What would this rookie know?

336
00:20:49,257 --> 00:20:50,801
That's the same as telling me
to do everything.

337
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:52,302
I guess you understood, then.

338
00:20:53,595 --> 00:20:54,429
Good luck.

339
00:20:54,513 --> 00:20:57,307
Where are you going?
Are you receiving a bribe or what?

340
00:20:57,391 --> 00:21:00,060
It's too bad that such a fine tradition
is disappearing these days.

341
00:21:01,353 --> 00:21:03,105
I really like your jokes.

342
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:06,066
"Jokes"?

343
00:21:06,608 --> 00:21:07,526
We weren't joking.

344
00:21:09,152 --> 00:21:10,028
Why?

345
00:21:10,112 --> 00:21:11,988
You only accept your salary
and nothing else?

346
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:16,701
Take him with you.

347
00:21:16,993 --> 00:21:17,994
Take this guy!

348
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:19,579
He believes everything he's told!

349
00:21:19,663 --> 00:21:21,206
What should I do with you?

350
00:21:29,506 --> 00:21:30,966
I just picked this up on my way here.

351
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:32,175
Nobody saw me.

352
00:21:33,218 --> 00:21:35,762
If we pick up money on the street,
we should give it to the police.

353
00:21:35,846 --> 00:21:37,013
Detective Kang,

354
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,850
please find the owner of this.

355
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:42,352
Wait, maybe you're the owner.

356
00:21:47,023 --> 00:21:49,568
I did a background check on you
the last few days.

357
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:52,237
Your family was rich,
but you went bankrupt when you were 15.

358
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,531
It seems like you need two lifetimes
to pay back the debt.

359
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:56,700
Right, I lived in an upscale neighborhood.

360
00:21:57,242 --> 00:21:58,160
Why? Are you jealous?

361
00:21:58,243 --> 00:21:59,494
Of course.

362
00:22:00,078 --> 00:22:01,788
I lived in Area B
of the Youth Detention Center.

363
00:22:03,457 --> 00:22:05,876
But I guess I'm better off now.

364
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:06,877
How?

365
00:22:08,086 --> 00:22:09,171
Did you buy your own house?

366
00:22:09,254 --> 00:22:11,715
Then I'd be jealous
because I live on rent.

367
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:13,467
I'm really curious, though.

368
00:22:14,551 --> 00:22:16,136
Why do you live so honestly?

369
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:18,096
You really are a curious person,
aren't you?

370
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:21,141
I don't live honestly.

371
00:22:21,224 --> 00:22:25,687
Somebody once told me to be someone
standing at the edge of the wrong path.

372
00:22:26,229 --> 00:22:27,606
So I'm living like this, okay?

373
00:22:27,689 --> 00:22:28,607
Wow.

374
00:22:29,274 --> 00:22:30,817
That's so touching.

375
00:22:32,694 --> 00:22:34,529
Then you should earn lots of money.

376
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:36,615
I bet the government
doesn't give you this much.

377
00:22:37,699 --> 00:22:39,534
I'm not asking for much.

378
00:22:40,118 --> 00:22:42,037
Just give me a call before any crackdowns,

379
00:22:42,287 --> 00:22:44,164
and let us off a little if we get caught.

380
00:22:44,998 --> 00:22:46,208
It's a win-win...

381
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:48,585
Civil servants can't beat up
civilians like this.

382
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:50,420
Don't you know what it's like these days?

383
00:22:51,046 --> 00:22:53,715
You can call the police if you want.
And I got hired ages ago.

384
00:22:53,882 --> 00:22:55,926
-You little...
-Hey, it's fine.

385
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:02,265
Why don't you calm down and...

386
00:23:02,891 --> 00:23:05,685
You asshole, you chose the wrong guy.

387
00:23:08,396 --> 00:23:10,607
You better be here at the next crackdown.

388
00:23:11,566 --> 00:23:12,692
And make sure I catch you,

389
00:23:14,027 --> 00:23:16,446
so I can get promoted, all right?

390
00:23:36,424 --> 00:23:38,802
-Taekwon!
-Taekwon!

391
00:23:39,427 --> 00:23:44,224
-Taekwondo! Concentration!
-Taekwondo! Concentration!

392
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:46,851
Everyone, gather round. Roll call.

393
00:23:46,935 --> 00:23:47,894
Yang Seo-jun.

394
00:23:47,978 --> 00:23:49,688
-Here!
-Here!

395
00:23:49,771 --> 00:23:50,689
Jeong Si-ho.

396
00:23:50,772 --> 00:23:51,773
-Here!
-Here!

397
00:23:52,357 --> 00:23:55,151
All right, answer just once,
shortly and politely.

398
00:23:55,235 --> 00:23:56,861
Rock, paper, scissors.

399
00:23:56,987 --> 00:23:58,154
Jeong Seo-yun.

400
00:23:58,238 --> 00:23:59,155
-Here!
-Here!

401
00:24:00,073 --> 00:24:01,032
Jeong Ji-min.

402
00:24:01,283 --> 00:24:02,617
-Here!
-Here!

403
00:24:02,701 --> 00:24:04,035
Rock, paper, scissors.

404
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:09,457
The five tenets of Taekwondo
are courtesy, perseverance, integrity...

405
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:10,417
Hey!

406
00:24:11,001 --> 00:24:12,294
Be quiet, you little jerks!

407
00:24:14,212 --> 00:24:17,465
You should listen to your Taekwondo master
when he's talking, all right?

408
00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:18,508
You little punks!

409
00:24:24,097 --> 00:24:25,348
Why are you crying?

410
00:24:29,394 --> 00:24:30,395
Stop crying!

411
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,064
Cut it out!

412
00:24:42,365 --> 00:24:43,575
Hey, Sin-jae.

413
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:46,077
You...

414
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,790
You should stop teaching the kids.

415
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:54,586
-Why?
-They said they're scared of you.

416
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:58,006
They go home all excited
and never come back.

417
00:24:58,506 --> 00:25:00,467
Gosh, kids these days
don't have any perseverance.

418
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,509
Perseverance? You punk!

419
00:25:01,593 --> 00:25:03,511
You're the one who should
have perseverance!

420
00:25:03,595 --> 00:25:05,388
My goodness.

421
00:25:05,472 --> 00:25:07,182
You can't do this to me.

422
00:25:07,265 --> 00:25:09,768
You took my money, saying
you'll stop me from becoming a gangster.

423
00:25:09,851 --> 00:25:12,270
How will I make a living
if you suddenly kick me out like this?

424
00:25:12,354 --> 00:25:14,022
All I can do is become a gangster.

425
00:25:14,606 --> 00:25:17,817
If I do, I'm going to take tons of money
for the building maintenance fees,

426
00:25:18,443 --> 00:25:19,444
so think about it.

427
00:25:19,694 --> 00:25:23,198
Why weren't you so good with words
in front of the kids?

428
00:25:23,782 --> 00:25:25,116
I'll be better tomorrow.

429
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:27,619
I can lead kids on the right path, too.

430
00:25:27,702 --> 00:25:29,579
I'm going to get someone else
to do the leading,

431
00:25:30,163 --> 00:25:31,289
so just do something else.

432
00:25:32,582 --> 00:25:34,584
Not someone who leads people
to the right path,

433
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,922
but be someone
on the edge of the wrong path.

434
00:25:48,139 --> 00:25:50,975
POLICE EXAM PREPARATION BOOK

435
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,902
I handed the weapon over
to the forensic investigation.

436
00:26:01,277 --> 00:26:02,153
I was really anxious.

437
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:11,246
The forensic investigation just called.

438
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,748
-You left your phone there.
-Really?

439
00:26:14,332 --> 00:26:16,960
I bought it yesterday. Oh, no...

440
00:26:20,213 --> 00:26:21,673
My gosh, Jangmi.

441
00:26:22,257 --> 00:26:23,800
Can you really do such an important job?

442
00:26:26,386 --> 00:26:27,637
What you're going to do now

443
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:31,224
is the most important job
for our team's rookie needs to do.

444
00:26:31,307 --> 00:26:32,267
Is it a case?

445
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,144
It will be if you don't do this properly.

446
00:26:34,686 --> 00:26:37,439
Organize the bills for activity fees
and write up work progress reports.

447
00:26:37,522 --> 00:26:40,525
The overtime payments of
your senior colleagues depend on you now.

448
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:43,737
So with your sense of duty and passion,
record each second. Pick up your pen.

449
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,904
Right!

450
00:26:47,866 --> 00:26:49,909
Use a black pen, Jangmi.

451
00:26:51,161 --> 00:26:52,203
Black!

452
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,669
Yes, this is Violent Crimes Division
Squad Three, Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

453
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,046
<i>It's me. I guess you're still at work.</i>

454
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,256
<i>It's a relief.</i>

455
00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:04,591
Kim Gae-ddong?

456
00:27:05,341 --> 00:27:07,635
No wonder why my cellphone
was quiet today.

457
00:27:08,219 --> 00:27:12,640
How did you find out
the direct line to my office desk?

458
00:27:12,724 --> 00:27:14,017
Eun-sup.

459
00:27:14,476 --> 00:27:15,477
<i>-Jangmi!
-Yes?</i>

460
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,061
<i>Bring Jo Eun-sup here.</i>

461
00:27:17,395 --> 00:27:19,522
<i>In handcuffs.
You can beat him up if he refuses.</i>

462
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:50,804
-Eun-sup?
-Wow, it's broken.

463
00:27:51,054 --> 00:27:52,889
Gosh, it can't even live up to its worth.

464
00:27:54,432 --> 00:27:55,600
Don't even talk to me.

465
00:27:55,683 --> 00:27:58,394
I'm not getting involved with you anymore.

466
00:28:00,021 --> 00:28:00,939
It's great.

467
00:28:04,818 --> 00:28:05,693
Hey,

468
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,613
what did you say to make me
get handcuffed?

469
00:28:09,197 --> 00:28:11,407
All I said was "Eun-sup."

470
00:28:11,491 --> 00:28:14,118
I told you to keep it a secret.

471
00:28:14,202 --> 00:28:16,287
How can you be so cheap?

472
00:28:16,371 --> 00:28:17,997
You might not know it,

473
00:28:18,832 --> 00:28:20,333
but nothing I have is cheap.

474
00:28:21,334 --> 00:28:22,836
So as an apology,

475
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:25,547
I'm appointing you
chief of the Royal Guard in this world.

476
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:29,217
From now on, you're the Unbreakable Sword.
It's a very honorable position.

477
00:28:32,262 --> 00:28:34,180
-You're crazy.
-"Crazy"?

478
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:40,061
I must take you back to my world with me.

479
00:28:40,478 --> 00:28:41,646
You'll be beheaded for sure.

480
00:28:42,272 --> 00:28:43,815
Yeah, sure.

481
00:28:44,732 --> 00:28:47,819
I don't have a head, so I'll skip my bow.

482
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:55,493
Yeong.

483
00:28:57,287 --> 00:28:58,413
Head Court Lady Noh.

484
00:29:01,499 --> 00:29:03,209
Since His Majesty
is not shown to the public,

485
00:29:03,293 --> 00:29:05,587
there are rumors about Him being ill.

486
00:29:06,796 --> 00:29:09,883
They will soon
start writing speculative articles.

487
00:29:09,966 --> 00:29:11,968
We are in trouble now.

488
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:15,513
He won't come out of his study
and won't let anyone in or out.

489
00:29:15,847 --> 00:29:19,893
I'm feeling so heavy with worries.

490
00:29:21,686 --> 00:29:22,604
I have a solution.

491
00:29:24,564 --> 00:29:26,691
We can cloud the issue in times like this.

492
00:29:28,401 --> 00:29:31,154
Where is the Jo Yeong,
the Chief of the Royal Guards?

493
00:29:44,292 --> 00:29:45,293
What are you doing here?

494
00:29:45,376 --> 00:29:46,210
Work.

495
00:29:47,295 --> 00:29:48,963
Give me your phone, unlocked.

496
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:54,260
Head Court Lady Noh
told you to cooperate with me, right?

497
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,563
Do you have SNS?

498
00:30:05,813 --> 00:30:06,981
I don't.

499
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:09,692
I knew it. I was just checking
if you have any hidden accounts.

500
00:30:10,276 --> 00:30:12,111
I'm going to check your photo album.

501
00:30:15,698 --> 00:30:18,159
I guess you came to work
with your father's phone.

502
00:30:18,743 --> 00:30:19,661
It's my phone.

503
00:30:19,744 --> 00:30:21,579
I know. I'm just making fun of you.

504
00:30:24,082 --> 00:30:24,916
Amazing.

505
00:30:26,584 --> 00:30:27,835
I'm going to use this photo.

506
00:30:35,009 --> 00:30:37,470
BUSAN, THE CULTURAL CAPITAL

507
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:46,688
<i>-Jo Yeong's official account?
-Don't impersonate him.</i>

508
00:30:46,771 --> 00:30:48,272
<i>Gon Jo couple is official now.</i>

509
00:30:48,355 --> 00:30:52,234
<i>-I thought it would never happen.
-Oppa, I love you. English please.</i>

510
00:31:10,461 --> 00:31:12,088
JEONG TAE-EUL, NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

511
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:15,299
Find out everything you can about her.

512
00:31:15,883 --> 00:31:17,802
And of course, this is a secret.

513
00:31:19,095 --> 00:31:20,179
Isn't she

514
00:31:20,847 --> 00:31:23,474
the woman from the ID card
His Majesty had?

515
00:31:24,267 --> 00:31:26,060
How do you know that?

516
00:31:26,144 --> 00:31:29,480
I already investigated her three years ago
under His Majesty's orders.

517
00:31:30,064 --> 00:31:33,818
I looked through every database,
but such a person didn't exist.

518
00:31:34,485 --> 00:31:37,739
And as you would've seen,
the issue date is strange, too.

519
00:31:37,822 --> 00:31:39,532
There's a high chance it's fake.

520
00:31:39,657 --> 00:31:40,825
I'm getting a headache.

521
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:42,744
And it breaks my heart.

522
00:31:42,827 --> 00:31:44,579
I told him not to,

523
00:31:44,912 --> 00:31:48,166
but I guess he never gave up.

524
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,335
The woman he was chasing,

525
00:31:51,836 --> 00:31:54,756
could it have been this woman?

526
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:59,343
How can there be nothing on her?

527
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:02,263
There aren't
any immigration records, either.

528
00:32:02,346 --> 00:32:03,681
Don't worry.

529
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:07,101
That woman isn't His Majesty's style.

530
00:32:07,935 --> 00:32:09,604
She won't even get along well with him.

531
00:32:10,313 --> 00:32:12,732
You can tell she's not a science
kind of person.

532
00:32:13,191 --> 00:32:14,275
And you,

533
00:32:15,109 --> 00:32:17,070
do you know what your style is?

534
00:32:21,449 --> 00:32:22,533
Oh, my head.

535
00:32:23,451 --> 00:32:24,786
Oh, my heart.

536
00:32:26,329 --> 00:32:28,206
<i>The number you have called is unavailable.</i>

537
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:35,963
<i>The number you have called is unavailable.</i>

538
00:32:36,047 --> 00:32:37,632
SIN-JAE

539
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:40,426
Detective Jeong!

540
00:32:41,594 --> 00:32:44,138
Oh, Officer Yoon.
Did you get the DNA results?

541
00:32:44,722 --> 00:32:45,932
Yes.

542
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:50,353
But there aren't any matches,
even in the missing person database.

543
00:32:52,814 --> 00:32:53,815
Nothing?

544
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,359
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

545
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:58,111
You said he doesn't even have ID.

546
00:32:58,694 --> 00:33:01,656
How can there really be nothing?
I've never seen such a person.

547
00:33:01,739 --> 00:33:02,990
Damn it. Hang on.

548
00:33:07,411 --> 00:33:08,913
Yes, this is Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

549
00:33:09,247 --> 00:33:11,207
<i>Detective, this is
the Korea Racing Authority.</i>

550
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,251
<i>I'm contacting you about the document
you sent us.</i>

551
00:33:14,168 --> 00:33:17,004
<i>Could we take a look
at the horse you were asking about?</i>

552
00:33:19,715 --> 00:33:21,717
So is it a stolen horse?

553
00:33:21,968 --> 00:33:24,846
<i>No, it wasn't stolen at all.</i>

554
00:33:25,221 --> 00:33:28,099
<i>It's a rare breed from
a Spanish descendant,</i>

555
00:33:28,182 --> 00:33:30,893
<i>so we can't find it
in the Republic of Korea right now.</i>

556
00:33:31,811 --> 00:33:34,814
<i>We're curious about how
that horse is here.</i>

557
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:40,444
<i>Hello? Lieutenant Jeong?</i>

558
00:33:52,272 --> 00:33:53,815
Let's talk after I drink a glass.

559
00:33:54,274 --> 00:33:55,608
I really need alcohol right now.

560
00:33:56,443 --> 00:33:59,446
But why are you mixing
two kinds of alcohol?

561
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:08,872
It's not just mixing.
It's making a new drink.

562
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:10,790
Is it your first time seeing this?

563
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:12,542
Why?

564
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:15,462
Your horse is of Spanish descendant,
but you've never seen this?

565
00:34:15,628 --> 00:34:17,589
Don't you have soju and beer
in your world?

566
00:34:17,672 --> 00:34:19,466
-We have.
-Then why don't you mix them?

567
00:34:19,966 --> 00:34:20,967
Don't you know MSD?

568
00:34:22,802 --> 00:34:24,512
You know MSD?

569
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:26,222
It's the joy of life.

570
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,392
Making,

571
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,520
shaking,

572
00:34:32,312 --> 00:34:33,146
and drinking.

573
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:35,648
Bottoms up for the King.

574
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:39,819
Why are you laughing?

575
00:34:39,903 --> 00:34:43,031
The MSD you know and the MSD I know
are so different.

576
00:34:43,656 --> 00:34:44,991
And I'm telling you again,

577
00:34:45,075 --> 00:34:47,285
I never drink anything my subordinates
haven’t tried the taste for me.

578
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,623
Are you really from another world?

579
00:34:51,706 --> 00:34:53,249
I told you countless times
but you don't believe me.

580
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:57,587
Who's allowed to use that door?

581
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:02,550
I'm not sure yet,

582
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,512
but there's a chance
that someone besides me used it.

583
00:35:05,595 --> 00:35:06,846
Who is that?

584
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:09,140
I can only tell you
if you become part of my royal court.

585
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:11,226
Stop making things up.

586
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:12,519
You should know, though.

587
00:35:12,602 --> 00:35:13,686
If I make up something,

588
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:14,938
then that becomes the law.

589
00:35:15,105 --> 00:35:16,439
You should know, though.

590
00:35:16,523 --> 00:35:17,774
If I give you a punch,

591
00:35:17,857 --> 00:35:19,317
then that becomes a bruise.

592
00:35:19,401 --> 00:35:21,611
-You really are a liberal arts person.
-Right.

593
00:35:21,694 --> 00:35:23,071
Liberal arts people make the ideas

594
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:24,906
and the science people
make them come true.

595
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:26,991
But I don't think you're capable
of doing either.

596
00:35:27,075 --> 00:35:28,410
You said it's a parallel universe.

597
00:35:28,576 --> 00:35:30,078
But why is the capital Busan?

598
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:31,663
Busan is the cultural capital.

599
00:35:31,746 --> 00:35:33,206
The central government is in Seoul.

600
00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:35,834
It's the political capital,
and Pyongyang is the economic capital.

601
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:37,502
You use the term South and North Korea,

602
00:35:37,585 --> 00:35:40,004
but in our world,
it's the southern and northern region.

603
00:35:40,922 --> 00:35:43,925
And both the King and Queen
stay in the main palace in Busan.

604
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:47,053
-In case you were wondering.
-Do you think that makes sense?

605
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:49,848
Why would the King stay
in Busan and not Seoul?

606
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:51,975
I'm not curious, though.

607
00:35:55,645 --> 00:35:59,315
Since 1592,
we've had a political conflict with Japan.

608
00:35:59,774 --> 00:36:01,234
We're always at the brink of war.

609
00:36:02,068 --> 00:36:04,237
So my grandfather, King Haejong,

610
00:36:04,404 --> 00:36:06,948
announced a constitutional monarchy
in 1945,

611
00:36:07,615 --> 00:36:10,994
<i>leaving the parliament in Seoul
and moving the palace to Busan.</i>

612
00:36:11,995 --> 00:36:13,329
<i>That decision was made to show</i>

613
00:36:13,413 --> 00:36:17,000
<i>the royal court's resolution to stand
at the front to face our enemies first.</i>

614
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:18,710
<i>That's why</i>

615
00:36:18,793 --> 00:36:21,504
<i>the statue of Admiral Yi Sun-Sin
is in Busan in my world.</i>

616
00:36:22,505 --> 00:36:24,090
<i>The statue shows</i>

617
00:36:24,924 --> 00:36:28,761
<i>that no one can cross our Kingdom's seas
and invade our Kingdom.</i>

618
00:36:33,308 --> 00:36:34,684
I see your novel is going well.

619
00:36:37,353 --> 00:36:39,105
I guess you got nothing on my DNA results.

620
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,233
But you still can't really believe me,

621
00:36:43,776 --> 00:36:44,819
right?

622
00:36:48,656 --> 00:36:50,241
So who do you think I am?

623
00:36:51,534 --> 00:36:54,120
There is no information at all
about me in this world.

624
00:37:02,629 --> 00:37:03,880
I hope your earth

625
00:37:05,298 --> 00:37:07,133
can become round soon.

626
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:25,276
I'm going to use the bathroom and pay,
so you can head out first.

627
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,717
What is...

628
00:38:01,354 --> 00:38:02,647
No wonder.

629
00:38:03,231 --> 00:38:05,149
I thought it was too expensive.

630
00:38:06,109 --> 00:38:07,569
When did you get that?

631
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:09,779
Before you came back,

632
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:12,907
the owner asked if I needed anything else,
so I answered yes.

633
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,327
I nearly got fooled.

634
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:19,831
A King? And the stuff about the capital?

635
00:38:21,124 --> 00:38:22,709
You're a total nutjob.

636
00:38:23,251 --> 00:38:25,128
This is so ridiculous.

637
00:38:25,795 --> 00:38:27,422
I've been missing you for 25 years--

638
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:29,382
-Shut up!
-You'll be beheaded for interrupting.

639
00:38:29,465 --> 00:38:31,259
You'll be beheaded for your lies.

640
00:38:32,969 --> 00:38:34,637
Just go and keep writing your novel.

641
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,348
My gosh.

642
00:38:46,649 --> 00:38:47,859
Why are you following me?

643
00:38:48,443 --> 00:38:49,652
I'm not following you.

644
00:38:50,945 --> 00:38:53,364
I'm going to Maximus to say goodnight.

645
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:14,761
But why won't it eat
the carrots I give it?

646
00:39:14,969 --> 00:39:17,555
Do Senior Seventh Rank officials
only eat freshly picked food?

647
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:18,931
Did you taste it beforehand?

648
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,652
Why didn't you eat the carrots
she gave you?

649
00:39:31,944 --> 00:39:33,071
Just eat them from now on.

650
00:39:33,321 --> 00:39:34,864
Keep it in your mouth,
even if you don't want to.

651
00:39:38,451 --> 00:39:39,744
That's a king's order.

652
00:40:06,062 --> 00:40:06,938
<i>What?</i>

653
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:10,358
Are you wondering
why I always look at this?

654
00:40:10,733 --> 00:40:11,734
Yes.

655
00:40:12,485 --> 00:40:14,445
Prince Buyeong performed the autopsy.

656
00:40:15,405 --> 00:40:19,242
The fingerprints and DNA
all matched with traitor Lee Lim.

657
00:40:20,034 --> 00:40:22,203
I know. I know that, but...

658
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:25,832
The body is like Lee Lim,

659
00:40:25,915 --> 00:40:28,501
but it's like an unknown symbol
that's not really him.

660
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,423
Sometimes,
symbols of mathematics or science

661
00:40:33,923 --> 00:40:36,467
are useful when understanding
a certain phenomenon.

662
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:40,346
For example, the plus sign
doesn't have any meaning by itself,

663
00:40:41,097 --> 00:40:43,766
since it's a symbol that means
adding something.

664
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,811
So I have a theory

665
00:40:48,271 --> 00:40:51,774
that this body is a symbol
that Lee Lim used

666
00:40:53,025 --> 00:40:54,861
to show that he died.

667
00:40:56,571 --> 00:40:58,322
But then there would be a bigger question.

668
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:01,117
What is this body,

669
00:41:02,452 --> 00:41:04,162
and how does it have the same DNA?

670
00:41:06,456 --> 00:41:07,790
What was added

671
00:41:10,585 --> 00:41:12,044
to the real traitor Lee Lim?

672
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:17,508
Where are you?

673
00:41:20,094 --> 00:41:21,304
What has been

674
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,348
added to you, Your Majesty?

675
00:43:28,431 --> 00:43:30,224
I told you to just pretend.

676
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:31,851
Don't actually sell food here.

677
00:43:33,769 --> 00:43:35,271
Careful what you say.

678
00:43:35,354 --> 00:43:36,731
Those kids have ears too, you know.

679
00:43:40,234 --> 00:43:41,235
Hey, kids.

680
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:43,446
Move. That's my seat.

681
00:43:43,529 --> 00:43:46,073
I heard that if you sit here,
you can become a Prime Minister.

682
00:43:47,074 --> 00:43:49,076
I succeeded because it was me.

683
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,661
I even went to the palace before.

684
00:43:51,245 --> 00:43:52,622
That woman goes there every day.

685
00:43:53,414 --> 00:43:54,790
She's the King's girlfriend.

686
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:56,584
Right?

687
00:43:57,877 --> 00:44:00,004
You can stay and play,
and you can go home.

688
00:44:01,047 --> 00:44:04,300
Stop babysitting the kids around here.
You're taking care of all the kids.

689
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:09,096
My gosh.

690
00:44:10,389 --> 00:44:15,102
You can play here and go home
when your mom gets back.

691
00:44:15,186 --> 00:44:16,020
-Okay.
-Okay.

692
00:44:20,733 --> 00:44:22,777
Mom, I want pollack soup.

693
00:44:23,486 --> 00:44:25,237
And I want it spicy.

694
00:44:27,281 --> 00:44:30,409
What about the men outside?
Are they joining you?

695
00:44:32,078 --> 00:44:33,329
Just Mr. Kim.

696
00:44:34,121 --> 00:44:37,249
The security team takes turns eating,
so don't mind them.

697
00:44:39,919 --> 00:44:40,878
What's that?

698
00:44:40,962 --> 00:44:44,757
Oh, a customer left it here.
They might come back to get it.

699
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:47,385
Get some sleep. I'll wake you up later.

700
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:49,095
Okay.

701
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,661
RELICS EXHIBITION
KINGDOM OF COREA

702
00:45:29,468 --> 00:45:30,761
I hope your earth

703
00:45:31,846 --> 00:45:33,556
can become round soon.

704
00:45:52,324 --> 00:45:53,242
What's going on?

705
00:45:54,201 --> 00:45:55,119
The fuel tank is full.

706
00:45:58,539 --> 00:46:00,541
Right, I should turn off the engine first.

707
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:02,334
Stay calm.

708
00:46:16,932 --> 00:46:18,768
This is Hero Taekwondo Academy.

709
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:21,437
Hello?

710
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,521
<i>Is that you?</i>

711
00:46:24,315 --> 00:46:25,441
Why...

712
00:46:25,733 --> 00:46:27,818
Why is Kim Gae-ddong answering...

713
00:46:30,946 --> 00:46:31,822
What?

714
00:46:39,914 --> 00:46:41,332
<i>Did you just hang up on me?</i>

715
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:42,958
You did that often to me.

716
00:46:44,376 --> 00:46:45,461
Don't you dare.

717
00:46:46,212 --> 00:46:47,254
Why are you over there?

718
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:50,341
I was here the whole time
since I came to this world.

719
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:52,259
You just didn't know it.

720
00:46:54,261 --> 00:46:55,304
Let me talk to my father.

721
00:46:55,554 --> 00:46:57,306
<i>Your father is having a meeting.</i>

722
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:01,936
<i>Your father gave me coffee,
and he even tasted it for me.</i>

723
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:04,980
<i>What do you need? I'll tell him later.</i>

724
00:47:06,315 --> 00:47:07,358
I'm...

725
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:09,902
in front of the supermarket,

726
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,738
but my car just stopped.

727
00:47:13,364 --> 00:47:16,283
I need him to watch my car
until the service center person comes.

728
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:17,701
<i>I can take a taxi.</i>

729
00:47:19,495 --> 00:47:20,496
What state is your car in?

730
00:47:22,748 --> 00:47:24,500
If I tell you, would you know...

731
00:47:25,626 --> 00:47:26,836
Oh, I guess you might.

732
00:47:27,086 --> 00:47:28,546
You said you're a science guy, right?

733
00:47:28,963 --> 00:47:30,297
Tell me, what should I do?

734
00:47:30,381 --> 00:47:31,549
Answer my questions first.

735
00:47:31,632 --> 00:47:33,175
-<i>Okay.</i>
-Did you change your engine oil?

736
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:35,344
-Of course.
-<i>And the fuel filter?</i>

737
00:47:35,427 --> 00:47:37,138
<i>You should change it every 20,000km.</i>

738
00:47:43,352 --> 00:47:44,186
What's that?

739
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:46,105
-What stuff do you have right now?
-<i>Oh, hang on.</i>

740
00:47:49,984 --> 00:47:51,068
A bottle of water,

741
00:47:51,819 --> 00:47:52,987
wet towels...

742
00:47:54,572 --> 00:47:56,991
Beef jerky and a hair tie.

743
00:47:57,741 --> 00:48:00,703
Then take the hair tie and water.

744
00:48:00,786 --> 00:48:01,871
<i>Okay, hang on.</i>

745
00:48:01,954 --> 00:48:03,622
Tie your hair and open up the bonnet.

746
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:08,169
-<i>And...</i>
-Yes?

747
00:48:10,671 --> 00:48:12,798
Drink that water while you wait.
I'll head over there.

748
00:48:13,716 --> 00:48:14,758
Are you kidding me?

749
00:48:14,884 --> 00:48:17,219
Good cars stop like that
to protect their engines.

750
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:21,098
That means there's nothing you can do.
I'll be there soon.

751
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:22,850
Just hang on.

752
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:42,119
The service center person's
going to come in ten minutes.

753
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:43,954
So just watch my car until then.

754
00:48:44,663 --> 00:48:46,123
Don't touch anything.

755
00:48:46,207 --> 00:48:47,208
You...

756
00:48:49,501 --> 00:48:51,170
Gosh, it feels like...

757
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,583
I'm leaving my kid in danger.

758
00:50:19,133 --> 00:50:22,052
So take care of it like you take care
of your Senior Seventh Rank official.

759
00:50:22,553 --> 00:50:25,723
This thing is
a Senior Fifth Rank official to me, okay?

760
00:50:26,307 --> 00:50:29,351
Time stopped for a bit just now.

761
00:50:30,352 --> 00:50:31,270
Didn't you feel that?

762
00:50:33,605 --> 00:50:34,940
Why would time stop?

763
00:50:35,274 --> 00:50:38,193
-Did you decide to get weirder?
-Everything stopped except for me.

764
00:50:38,277 --> 00:50:39,486
Why not you?

765
00:50:41,447 --> 00:50:45,492
It's a theory, but I think it might be
a side effect of using that door.

766
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:48,203
But

767
00:50:49,163 --> 00:50:50,080
thanks to that,

768
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:52,291
I saw something beautiful.

769
00:50:53,667 --> 00:50:55,794
Okay, enjoy yourself.

770
00:50:56,378 --> 00:50:58,297
And please watch my car too.

771
00:50:59,465 --> 00:51:00,341
Bye.

772
00:51:13,395 --> 00:51:16,148
I unintentionally got a car.

773
00:51:28,911 --> 00:51:30,537
EOSU BOOKSTORE

774
00:51:57,356 --> 00:51:59,525
THE KING LEFT THE PALACE

775
00:52:02,528 --> 00:52:03,612
Your Highness.

776
00:52:06,949 --> 00:52:08,158
It's been a long time.

777
00:52:08,659 --> 00:52:10,744
The world is peaceful,

778
00:52:11,954 --> 00:52:14,623
so I couldn't feel the time passing by.

779
00:52:15,624 --> 00:52:18,168
I guess there are many customers
in the book shop.

780
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:22,798
Yes, they always come at the agreed time.

781
00:53:24,526 --> 00:53:25,569
<i>On that day...</i>

782
00:53:27,488 --> 00:53:29,823
<i>I should have realized it once I found out</i>

783
00:53:30,991 --> 00:53:32,326
<i>that Manpasikjeok is the key.</i>

784
00:53:36,038 --> 00:53:38,624
<i>That traitor Lee Lim has
the other half of the Manpasikjeok.</i>

785
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,585
<i>And that he is probably alive</i>

786
00:53:42,836 --> 00:53:45,255
<i>moving back and forth
from the two parallel worlds.</i>

787
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,425
<i>I should have known</i>

788
00:53:51,053 --> 00:53:54,139
<i>before seeing the beauty
I have been looking for.</i>

789
00:53:57,309 --> 00:53:59,186
<i>I should have known that
Manpasikjeok is the key</i>

790
00:54:00,812 --> 00:54:02,439
<i>and the lock.</i>

791
00:54:06,235 --> 00:54:07,236
Have you all been well?

792
00:54:07,903 --> 00:54:09,571
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

793
00:54:17,329 --> 00:54:18,705
Listen up, everyone.

794
00:54:22,376 --> 00:54:24,503
We finally got the results
from the Forensics team.

795
00:54:25,963 --> 00:54:30,133
They found the blood of both the killer
and the victim on the crowbar.

796
00:54:30,217 --> 00:54:31,969
We can finish up the case on Kim Bok-man.

797
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:34,596
Sin-jae,
you write the investigation report.

798
00:54:34,846 --> 00:54:36,473
Good job, good job.

799
00:54:36,598 --> 00:54:37,891
Great job, everyone.

800
00:54:37,975 --> 00:54:38,850
Thank you, sir.

801
00:54:39,601 --> 00:54:41,728
"Good job"? That's it?

802
00:54:41,853 --> 00:54:44,481
-We should have an after-work party today.
-My gosh.

803
00:54:44,565 --> 00:54:46,024
But Chief...

804
00:54:46,108 --> 00:54:47,442
-Oh, please.
-Oh, please.

805
00:54:48,402 --> 00:54:51,113
Kim Bok-man is strongly denying it,

806
00:54:51,196 --> 00:54:54,199
but everything's adding up perfectly.
Don't you think so?

807
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:57,744
Among the guys
who strongly denied their crimes,

808
00:54:57,828 --> 00:54:59,037
nobody was innocent.

809
00:54:59,121 --> 00:55:01,039
They all killed someone
and just denied it.

810
00:55:01,123 --> 00:55:03,542
-We have the weapon and a clear motive.
-Right.

811
00:55:03,625 --> 00:55:05,460
And the victim's body was in his trunk.

812
00:55:05,544 --> 00:55:08,755
Which out of those three is bothering you?

813
00:55:09,756 --> 00:55:12,801
I'm not saying there's something specific.

814
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,846
It just feels like someone
planned all this.

815
00:55:17,264 --> 00:55:18,307
My gosh.

816
00:55:27,316 --> 00:55:29,693
Why are you looking at me?
She's looking at me.

817
00:55:31,945 --> 00:55:34,698
Buzz, buzz. 2019 Kang Sin-jae.

818
00:55:34,865 --> 00:55:36,450
Is it the same over there?

819
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:39,244
Do you have after-work parties
without investigating everything?

820
00:55:39,828 --> 00:55:43,582
It's been 20 years,
so I guess some things would've changed.

821
00:55:43,665 --> 00:55:45,751
It's Cho Jin-woong from <i>Signal</i>!

822
00:55:45,834 --> 00:55:48,545
She's talking nonsense while
looking at me, and he keeps playing along.

823
00:55:48,629 --> 00:55:50,464
You little... Hey.

824
00:55:51,798 --> 00:55:52,716
You little...

825
00:55:54,343 --> 00:55:55,302
Good job.

826
00:56:27,918 --> 00:56:30,295
<i>The number you have called is unavailable.</i>

827
00:56:30,921 --> 00:56:32,297
The victim's wife isn't picking up.

828
00:56:32,964 --> 00:56:34,758
I guess she ran away from the loan sharks.

829
00:56:36,218 --> 00:56:37,386
Are you going to keep digging?

830
00:56:37,928 --> 00:56:39,471
Kim Bok-man is garbage anyway.

831
00:56:39,554 --> 00:56:42,349
We can put him behind bars for longer,
so why go through all the trouble?

832
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:43,892
A detective shouldn't talk like that.

833
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:45,977
You came with me anyway

834
00:56:46,061 --> 00:56:47,938
so we can make sure
he isn't falsely accused.

835
00:56:48,021 --> 00:56:49,773
I'm only making sure
you don't feel wronged.

836
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:55,153
If you're going to keep digging,
trust the evidence we found.

837
00:56:55,737 --> 00:56:59,449
If it really was planned by someone,
that evidence will point to something.

838
00:57:02,744 --> 00:57:04,830
I doubt it'll have anything useful,
but I took this just in case.

839
00:57:04,913 --> 00:57:06,665
Check this.

840
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:16,341
Wow, 2019 Kang Sin-jae.

841
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:21,179
Hey, Kang Sin-jae from 11th grade,
Class 3, Number 5!

842
00:57:26,935 --> 00:57:28,353
What's going on today?

843
00:57:28,937 --> 00:57:30,814
The past keeps calling me today.

844
00:57:35,902 --> 00:57:37,738
Hey, it's been such a long time.

845
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:40,115
Has it been three years?

846
00:57:41,116 --> 00:57:43,118
What are you doing
in such a dangerous neighborhood?

847
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:46,037
Is he your old teacher?

848
00:57:46,705 --> 00:57:48,039
No, my old classmate.

849
00:57:48,874 --> 00:57:51,460
You should go. He might kill me.

850
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,670
I sent him to jail three years ago.

851
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:59,217
Your friend must've succeeded
after getting released from jail.

852
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:00,969
He has a large group.

853
00:58:01,052 --> 00:58:03,722
Yeah, and I only have you.

854
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:07,684
Sometimes I think I should've
just stayed on that path.

855
00:58:08,977 --> 00:58:09,936
You can rely on me.

856
00:58:12,397 --> 00:58:14,983
You're in Violent Crimes Squad Three now.

857
00:58:17,986 --> 00:58:20,238
Hey, misters.

858
00:58:20,322 --> 00:58:23,575
You can't just jaywalk like that.

859
00:58:25,035 --> 00:58:26,077
Is she your girlfriend?

860
00:58:28,246 --> 00:58:29,372
Oh, she's a detective.

861
00:58:29,956 --> 00:58:33,168
Female detectives are so scary these days.

862
00:58:33,335 --> 00:58:34,878
Maybe I should change my job.

863
00:58:34,961 --> 00:58:36,338
Should I become a househusband?

864
00:58:38,673 --> 00:58:40,342
You two have some nerve coming here.

865
00:58:40,425 --> 00:58:41,343
It's actually three people.

866
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:45,055
Hey! How did you get here?

867
00:58:45,138 --> 00:58:47,599
By car. Your Senior Fifth Rank official.

868
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:50,185
-It was pretty speedy.
-What?

869
00:58:53,188 --> 00:58:55,148
We'll talk about that later.

870
00:58:55,857 --> 00:58:57,901
So how are you going to do this?

871
00:58:58,276 --> 00:58:59,319
Are you three teaming up?

872
00:59:01,238 --> 00:59:02,531
I'm just going to watch.

873
00:59:03,073 --> 00:59:04,574
The governmental authority
can take care of it.

874
00:59:04,658 --> 00:59:06,701
Why are you confusing us?

875
00:59:07,494 --> 00:59:11,540
Guys, make sure to beat up Number 5
Kang Sin-jae from Class 3 properly.

876
00:59:12,207 --> 00:59:13,041
I owe him a lot.

877
00:59:42,195 --> 00:59:43,905
<i>Why did you become a cop?</i>

878
00:59:44,489 --> 00:59:46,366
<i>It's dangerous to be a cop.</i>

879
00:59:47,534 --> 00:59:50,829
<i>Not everyone in the world can be brave.</i>

880
00:59:52,038 --> 00:59:53,623
<i>So I decided to become brave.</i>

881
01:00:08,471 --> 01:00:10,515
Hey! Get this jerk first!

882
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,356
You really shouldn't do that.

883
01:00:19,357 --> 01:00:20,692
I hate it

884
01:00:22,235 --> 01:00:23,403
when people touch me.

885
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:47,218
I told you, didn't I? I worked out a lot.

886
01:00:47,969 --> 01:00:50,680
-I'm glad I was able to prove it.
-Are you kidding me?

887
01:00:50,764 --> 01:00:53,266
Are you mad? How could you drive that?
Do you even have a license?

888
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:54,809
The King doesn't have a license.

889
01:00:55,393 --> 01:00:57,687
-I'm the one who issues--
-You crazy...

890
01:01:00,565 --> 01:01:02,192
How did you know I was here?

891
01:01:02,359 --> 01:01:03,777
I went to the station to see you,

892
01:01:04,486 --> 01:01:06,488
and they said you were out.
I looked at your GPS

893
01:01:06,738 --> 01:01:08,573
and this place was searched
several times, so I came here.

894
01:01:08,657 --> 01:01:10,158
It's a relief I met you here.

895
01:01:10,283 --> 01:01:12,035
I nearly had to go to the forensics.

896
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:15,872
Over here.

897
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:23,046
I just got some random stuff.
Put on a bandage while we eat.

898
01:01:23,588 --> 01:01:24,631
So we meet again.

899
01:01:26,007 --> 01:01:28,927
Are you feeling all right?
It looked like you got beat up badly.

900
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:32,222
What are you doing here?
You seemed to be on their side.

901
01:01:32,305 --> 01:01:33,723
What's with the two of you?

902
01:01:33,848 --> 01:01:35,850
Let's continue after we eat.

903
01:01:36,685 --> 01:01:39,062
Gosh, why didn't you put some thought
into what you're buying?

904
01:01:39,145 --> 01:01:41,189
There are waterproof bandages these days.

905
01:01:41,398 --> 01:01:42,816
They are expensive.

906
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:45,902
And why did you only get one?

907
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:47,529
The bigger one is mine, okay?

908
01:01:47,654 --> 01:01:50,573
Focus on dividing it equally.
Don't think about eating the bigger half.

909
01:01:50,657 --> 01:01:52,993
You could've just bought two.
There are two people, you know.

910
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:56,705
<i>It's actually three people.</i>

911
01:02:16,224 --> 01:02:18,435
-I'll pay for this.
-No, I will. Just head out first.

912
01:02:18,518 --> 01:02:19,352
Mister.

913
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:21,104
Pay for mine.

914
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:23,565
I need that hospitality more than her.

915
01:02:26,401 --> 01:02:28,153
You really are a funny dude.

916
01:02:28,653 --> 01:02:30,822
He really doesn't hold grudges.

917
01:02:31,489 --> 01:02:33,324
He doesn't keep anything to himself.

918
01:02:33,992 --> 01:02:37,454
I'll head out first. Come with me.
Where did you park my car?

919
01:02:37,537 --> 01:02:40,081
Head to the station. And you come with me.

920
01:02:40,915 --> 01:02:41,833
Come with me.

921
01:02:45,712 --> 01:02:46,921
Did you enjoy it?

922
01:02:48,548 --> 01:02:49,424
Come out. Hurry.

923
01:02:52,552 --> 01:02:55,096
Are you going to be late today?

924
01:02:57,849 --> 01:02:58,975
Why are you asking?

925
01:02:59,768 --> 01:03:00,894
I should say goodbye.

926
01:03:02,062 --> 01:03:03,563
I might have to wait for you.

927
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:06,691
Where are you going?

928
01:03:07,609 --> 01:03:08,526
Back to my world.

929
01:03:10,236 --> 01:03:12,906
I'm the King of my country.
I left the palace empty for too long.

930
01:03:14,699 --> 01:03:17,535
And you didn't share that
obelisk-shaped ice cream with me.

931
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:22,123
You said it's a parallel universe.

932
01:03:22,207 --> 01:03:24,292
You make it sound as if you're going
to a different neighborhood.

933
01:03:24,375 --> 01:03:26,920
Did you finally remember the spell?

934
01:03:27,879 --> 01:03:30,173
It's not that I didn't know
how to go back.

935
01:03:31,216 --> 01:03:32,759
I just didn't want to go.

936
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:39,432
All right, then.
Goodbye. I'm gonna be late.

937
01:04:03,414 --> 01:04:06,084
I'll pay you back next time. Bye.

938
01:04:11,005 --> 01:04:12,549
That horse is yours, right?

939
01:04:15,093 --> 01:04:16,719
What's the company that made the harness?

940
01:04:17,011 --> 01:04:17,929
Give me their number.

941
01:04:18,513 --> 01:04:19,764
That's an interesting question.

942
01:04:20,765 --> 01:04:22,517
Why? Is it nice?

943
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,060
What's the company?

944
01:04:24,185 --> 01:04:27,105
I don't know.
I was never curious about it.

945
01:04:27,188 --> 01:04:30,441
And you won't be able to reach them
even if I knew.

946
01:04:30,525 --> 01:04:31,776
Stop the nonsense.

947
01:04:33,987 --> 01:04:35,905
What logo is this?

948
01:04:35,989 --> 01:04:37,407
I'm asking because I saw it before.

949
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:39,617
-Where?
-You better be honest.

950
01:04:39,784 --> 01:04:41,077
I didn't see it at some party.

951
01:04:41,161 --> 01:04:43,705
Wherever you think saw it,
you're mistaken.

952
01:04:44,414 --> 01:04:45,874
That logo is used

953
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:48,710
in a different country in another world.
It's not used here.

954
01:04:51,504 --> 01:04:52,589
Oh, really?

955
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:54,966
Then how do you know about it?

956
01:04:55,049 --> 01:04:57,177
I'm the King of that country,
the Kingdom of Corea.

957
01:05:00,805 --> 01:05:02,307
He's a liberal arts person too.

958
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:06,186
How long will it take to analyze this?

959
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:07,562
It's urgent.

960
01:05:07,645 --> 01:05:10,106
Extremely urgent.

961
01:05:10,607 --> 01:05:11,983
Everything is urgent here.

962
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:15,320
-It'll take two weeks minimum, I guess.
-Wait, this is--

963
01:05:15,403 --> 01:05:18,531
Everything here is about murder,
robbery, and assault.

964
01:05:18,615 --> 01:05:21,534
I truly mean it.

965
01:05:22,243 --> 01:05:24,954
I have a family.

966
01:05:25,872 --> 01:05:27,498
I work 13 hours a day.

967
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:29,959
Don't rush me.

968
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:36,174
Good luck.

969
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:42,180
What? You lent him money? How much?

970
01:05:42,263 --> 01:05:44,349
I told you. 2,007,560 won.

971
01:05:44,432 --> 01:05:47,685
He said he needed to check out of
the hotel, but he was missing that much.

972
01:05:48,478 --> 01:05:50,063
Do you sleep on a pile of cash?

973
01:05:50,772 --> 01:05:54,734
That guy didn't even have 7,560 won
to pay himself.

974
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:56,194
How could you lend him that much?

975
01:05:56,486 --> 01:06:00,031
He walks in even strides, has precise
pronunciation, and is good with words.

976
01:06:00,114 --> 01:06:02,367
You can't achieve that
with just any education, you know.

977
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:05,703
I'm sure he's wealthy. You just wait.
He'll pay me back double the amount.

978
01:06:06,788 --> 01:06:09,207
My gosh. Where is he right now?

979
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:12,168
He would've gone back to his world.
He said he was going home.

980
01:06:14,045 --> 01:06:15,046
What?

981
01:06:16,256 --> 01:06:18,800
He said he's the King of his country.

982
01:06:18,883 --> 01:06:20,718
And that he left
the palace empty for too long.

983
01:06:21,302 --> 01:06:23,221
He said he was going to stop by somewhere
and head home.
