00:00:00,055 --> 00:00:04,820
THE KING: ETERNAL MONARCH

2
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:07,508
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,843
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:21,480
You really came to Gwanghwamun.

5
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:27,486
And you're indeed wearing a jacket
with a lot of buttons.

6
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,364
This is strange.

7
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:33,909
You seem to know me.

8
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:49,842
Let's skip that.

9
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:52,886
If I don't do this now,

10
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:54,930
I'll probably regret it later.

11
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,902
<i>When it's fate, there are no coincidences.</i>

12
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,489
<i>It is inevitable by nature,</i>

13
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,827
<i>but when you realize its meaning,</i>

14
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,330
<i>it's always too late.</i>

15
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:30,507
DAD

16
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,186
-Dad.
-<i>Hey.</i>

17
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,314
<i>I got your call
and beat up all those guys.</i>

18
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:46,273
<i>Where are you?</i>

19
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,277
You got my call?

20
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,238
<i>Hey, what's wrong with your voice?</i>

21
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,660
<i>Hang on. The police are here.
They're asking for me.</i>

22
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:00,287
<i>I'll call you again later, okay?</i>

23
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,010
Is that a person?

24
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,428
Oh, my gosh.

25
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,014
Excuse me, are you okay?

26
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:21,725
She's bleeding pretty badly.
We should call an ambulance.

27
00:02:22,505 --> 00:02:23,458
EPISODE 15

28
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,814
So you're saying that my mom
met Lee Gon's,

29
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:30,234
I mean, Lee Ji-hun's mom?

30
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,070
<i>At the Grace Heritage Hotel.</i>

31
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:37,825
<i>Start with the security camera there.
You'll be able to track Song Jeong-hye.</i>

32
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:39,910
<i>Will you help me?</i>

33
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,871
Why did you follow my mom?

34
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,917
Are you going to help me?

35
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,228
Hello?

36
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:12,151
It's been a long time.
I believe your name was Hyeon-min.

37
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,069
Kang Hyeon-min.

38
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,577
You must have lost your mom.

39
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:23,453
I'll find her for you.

40
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:25,914
Who are you?

41
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,792
How can you look
exactly the same as before?

42
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:29,835
That's right.

43
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:33,463
That's why I thought I had a lot of time.

44
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:37,426
But now that I think of it,

45
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,637
that was the first crack.

46
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,600
My nephew was just a baby back then,

47
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,353
but now he's all grown
and he's almost caught up to me.

48
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:51,148
Enough with your family issues.
Just tell me why you called.

49
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:02,659
It's time for you to repay me
for changing your life.

50
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,878
The mother who was deceived
her whole life,

51
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,589
and the mother who deceived
her whole life.

52
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,592
The lives of both your mothers

53
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:20,761
depend on you.

54
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:31,939
Just get to the point.

55
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:33,774
What do you want?

56
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:38,028
You're someone who is far from
yet close to my nephew.

57
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,198
This is a very easy deal.

58
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,743
Bring me Lee Gon's whip,
whatever it takes.

59
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,748
And it'll be even better
if you kill him in the process.

60
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,962
Can't you suggest a normal deal?

61
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:57,923
I'm not a good son.

62
00:04:58,757 --> 00:04:59,925
I'm not that devoted.

63
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,176
You should be.

64
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:06,348
I'm sure you have an affection
that's sweet and melts quickly.

65
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,781
<i>So, Hyeon-min.</i>

66
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:26,743
Let's just die together.

67
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,870
-Let's die together.
-No!

68
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,414
-Hyeon-min!
-Mom!

69
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,040
-Mom!
-I'm sorry.

70
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,750
I'm really sorry!

71
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,004
It will only take a second.

72
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,672
-I'm so sorry!
-Stop...

73
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,549
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,343
Don't mind us, and just be on your way!

75
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,013
Your name is Min Seon-yeong.

76
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:47,723
And your son is Kang Hyeon-min.

77
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:55,939
Is this your thumbprint?

78
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,407
I said I'd pay by tomorrow.

79
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,534
I still have one day left.

80
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,494
Did you pray?

81
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,125
If you want to throw away your life,
why not give it to me?

82
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:19,921
I will give you and your son a new life.

83
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,259
You will be a palace worker
named Park Suk-jin,

84
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,680
and your son will have a rich father.

85
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,224
Who are you? What are you on about?

86
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,768
How would you do such a thing?

87
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,566
You...

88
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,276
Are you...

89
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,737
Prince Imperial Geum?

90
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:46,907
You're supposed to be dead.

91
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:54,706
You just need to nod

92
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,377
and grab a hold of the luck
that came to you.

93
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,386
What is it?

94
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,263
Are my palm lines strange?

95
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,764
It's interesting.

96
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:58,186
This scar connected with your fate line,
and became your new fate.

97
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,857
What kind of fate?

98
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,818
Well, since this is
just for fun, I'll tell you.

99
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,072
Your fate is to commit treason
if it were the old times.

100
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,200
Will it succeed?

101
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,036
Well, that's the problem.

102
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,791
You're fated to be beheaded,
I mean, if it were the old times.

103
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:23,920
So in other words,

104
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,340
you failed.

105
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,302
If you're actually me,

106
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,055
this is probably
where you're keeping your sword.

107
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,155
<i>That fate has already passed.</i>

108
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,117
I took part in the beheading myself.

109
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,497
Although it was foolish of me to do so.

110
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,876
I should've trusted myself

111
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,379
and killed the crown prince first.

112
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,466
The crown prince?

113
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:13,178
Na-ri! Hello, Na-ri!

114
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,641
Why are you holding hands?

115
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:18,934
It's so cheesy.

116
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,685
I've recently joined a palm-reading club.

117
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,230
-Should I read yours too?
-Yes.

118
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,576
I'm sure I've seen you before.

119
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:45,126
My gosh. Where did I see you before?

120
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,714
He is one of the traitor's followers.

121
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,925
<i>Get him!</i>

122
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,974
Stay right here behind me.

123
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,267
Yes, you saw me at Haeundae.

124
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,478
Can you relay a message
to my nephew, then?

125
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,732
I don't know where he's hiding right now,

126
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,736
but I'd really love to see him
on the death anniversary of his mother.

127
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:16,032
Tell him I'll be attending
the memorial mass.

128
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,078
And that if he doesn't show up,

129
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:26,334
I'll be visiting
your fortune-telling friend again.

130
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,558
Who is he? Do you really know him?

131
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,520
Stay right here, okay?

132
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,647
I need to call Tae-eul.

133
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,776
-She's right over there, outside.
-What?

134
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:54,613
Tae-eul!

135
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:56,865
What's going on?

136
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,244
Lee Lim came by just now.

137
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:02,871
You know, Lee Lim.

138
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,875
Here? Where's Dad?

139
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,628
He went to pick up the kids.
He couldn't cancel the afternoon class.

140
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,255
-What's all this fuss? Who is he?
-I'll tell you later.

141
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,886
Hey, what happened to your forehead?

142
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,638
What are you doing here when you're hurt?

143
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,890
You're hurt? Where? Why?

144
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,394
Something just happened.
Let's go, Sin-jae.

145
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:27,312
Jeong Tae-eul.

146
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,482
You were stabbed on your left side.

147
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,234
Oh, right.

148
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,737
I'm right-handed.

149
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,413
What's going on?

150
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,376
Eun-sup, take care of Na-ri.

151
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,462
What's with your forehead?

152
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,173
I asked him already,

153
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,343
-but he's not answering.
-Shut up.

154
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,154
It's you, Jo Yeong.

155
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,119
Don't look at me like that.

156
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,579
We're from the same country.

157
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,540
If I saw you there, you'd be dead by now.

158
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:30,750
Who put you up to this?

159
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,920
Who told you to poison the King?

160
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,131
Is it Lee Lim?

161
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,342
Narcotic painkillers.

162
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,928
They're prescribed
to late-stage cancer patients.

163
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,806
-Do you have cancer?
-Yes.

164
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,185
I'm going to die soon.

165
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,397
But don't get too excited.

166
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,443
Can you two give us a moment?

167
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,319
I'll talk to her.

168
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,614
Call me, then.

169
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,160
Call me if anything happens.

170
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,379
<i>So</i>

171
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,465
you came to kill me

172
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,092
because you have cancer?

173
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,261
What do you need?

174
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,263
A liver? A kidney?

175
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,518
Is that why you avoided my organs
when you stabbed me?

176
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,230
So it's true.

177
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,067
There really isn't even

178
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,779
a hint of anxiety in your eyes.

179
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,451
You're the one who called my dad
and told him, right?

180
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,788
Why didn't you stab me
deep enough to kill me?

181
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,589
Homemade soybean paste is the best.

182
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,466
The soup is amazing.

183
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,264
I didn't want to upset your dad.

184
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,268
What did you talk about with my dad?

185
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,731
I heard you were at my house
when I wasn't here.

186
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,318
We talked about food,

187
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:22,987
money,

188
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,156
and work.

189
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,116
It was all about you in the end.

190
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,167
Sitting here like this,

191
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,921
it feels like I'm looking into a mirror.

192
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:44,050
Tell me about yourself now.

193
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,013
You're pretty sentimental, aren't you?

194
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:18,042
VIOLENT CRIMES DIVISION SQUAD 3

195
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,590
Oh, my gosh!

196
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,551
How can we help you?

197
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,596
Is Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul here?

198
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,272
Is it April, 2020 right now?

199
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,984
Excuse me,
but how do you know Detective Jeong?

200
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:50,283
I've finally come to the year 2020.

201
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,286
Where is Lieutenant Jeong right now?

202
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:56,873
My name

203
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,083
is Lee Gon.

204
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,921
Where have you been?

205
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,673
I told you that you need rest.

206
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:10,094
And if you came to the hospital,
you should head to your room.

207
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,971
What are you doing here?

208
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,894
I'm waiting for someone.

209
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:35,370
He's here.

210
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,247
He's over there.

211
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,036
How

212
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:19,122
have you been?

213
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,291
Have you been waiting for me?

214
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,211
I missed you.

215
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,048
I missed you so much.

216
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:30,591
I'm sorry.

217
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,553
I'm sorry

218
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:37,640
that I keep making you wait.

219
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,185
I'm sorry.

220
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,231
I'm sorry.

221
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,147
Don't go.

222
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:31,069
I won't.

223
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:32,904
Don't go tomorrow, either.

224
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:37,825
I won't.

225
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:42,038
Lie down.

226
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,499
You got scolded for not getting rest.

227
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,097
I guess you'll leave when I fall asleep.

228
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,643
I really won't.

229
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,729
Do you need proof?

230
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,207
You're still wearing that jacket.

231
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,919
I wanted to change,

232
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,296
but I had no money for clothes.

233
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,800
Oh, no.

234
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:40,888
I was happy that you came to see me

235
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,391
when I was five

236
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,768
and when I was 27.

237
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,567
I was happy that you hugged me

238
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,696
when you saw me at Gwanghwamun.

239
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,908
I thought you were crazy
the two times you came to see me.

240
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:05,454
I thought my two visits
would have been endearing.

241
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,666
I didn't think you'd ask for my ID again.

242
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:18,676
Do you remember

243
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:23,598
what happened between us after that?

244
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,148
<i>Unlike the first time,</i>

245
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:36,194
<i>I believed half of his claims about
being the King of the Kingdom of Corea,</i>

246
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:39,697
<i>understood the concept of
parallel worlds a bit faster,</i>

247
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,283
<i>and went to his world a little earlier.</i>

248
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:46,579
<i>I still bought flower seeds
and scattered them,</i>

249
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,584
<i>and decided to embrace my fate
a little earlier,</i>

250
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,881
<i>but what was bound to happen
happened anyway,</i>

251
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:01,552
<i>and ironically,
the tragedy came earlier as well.</i>

252
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:22,615
<i>Fate</i>

253
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,408
<i>did not change.</i>

254
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,829
Is there no way

255
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:32,375
for us to change fate?

256
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,168
I'm sure there isn't.

257
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:36,963
There's no way

258
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,507
that fate can be broken so easily.

259
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:44,095
The larger the fate,
the more you need to walk

260
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:46,764
to reach your destination.

261
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:53,062
We just haven't reached
our destination yet.

262
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,239
Get some sleep.

263
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:05,324
No.

264
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:33,686
Yeong.

265
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:35,688
<i>Your Majesty?</i>

266
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,616
<i>Kang Sin-jae?</i>

267
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,578
<i>I'd appreciate it if you could
pass the phone to Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul</i>

268
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:51,704
<i>on your left.</i>

269
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:54,832
It's you, right?

270
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:58,377
You called me in front of
the chicken place about four years ago.

271
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,338
Yeong.

272
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,217
Was it really you
at the rowing competition?

273
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,929
I guess I did arrive at the right year.

274
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,931
You two have aged quite a bit.

275
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:14,685
You can even travel back in time now?

276
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,065
It is a relief that you are all right.

277
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,777
I found Song Jeong-hye.

278
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,404
I got a lot of help from Detective Kang.

279
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,449
I guess I have a lot to repay you.

280
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:30,618
Thank you for helping out.

281
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,828
Then repay me.

282
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:36,207
Repay me for your food
and the ride I gave you.

283
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,000
What would you like to get?

284
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:40,711
Your life.

285
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,925
You must have met Lee Lim.

286
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,135
And he must have used your two mothers.

287
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,306
Did Lee Lim tell you to kill me?

288
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:58,229
Will you die for me?
It'll be best if you died in your world.

289
00:23:58,312 --> 00:23:59,855
Killing a king will be difficult.

290
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:03,025
It'll be easier to kill someone
without an identity.

291
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,820
It's so that you'll have
a lot of mourners at your funeral.

292
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,989
Call me when you're leaving.

293
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:13,744
Your Majesty.

294
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:15,955
What about Song Jeong-hye?

295
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,546
It's that house.

296
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,299
Lee Lim still hasn't shown up yet.

297
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,510
You must stand watch

298
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,847
and find out Lee Lim's route
to his bamboo forest.

299
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,306
Yes, Your Majesty.

300
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:38,811
And I got a call from Jo Eun-sup.

301
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:40,646
He said he met Lee Lim.

302
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,066
And Lee Lim mentioned

303
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:47,778
the memorial mass of the late Queen.

304
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,907
Song Jeong-hye will be going to church
in 20 minutes.

305
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,617
There's always someone watching her.

306
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,879
I think you've got the time wrong.

307
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,171
Let go of me.

308
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:51,634
If I scream right now,
things will get more complicated.

309
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,866
It must be you.

310
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:18,911
Lee Lim's nephew.

311
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,792
The same face as Ji-hun.

312
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:33,467
If Ji-hun were alive,

313
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:36,845
he'd have grown up like you.

314
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:44,311
But Ji-hun died

315
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,147
because of you.

316
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:52,945
And it seems like you'll die
because of me.

317
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,576
Lee Lim said that's why he kept me alive.

318
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:14,008
Detective Kang, it's me. I need your help.

319
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:16,885
Will you be okay?

320
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,271
It's my mother's death anniversary soon.

321
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,025
I believe Lee Lim

322
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,819
is planning on taking you there that day.

323
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,824
If you go to the other world,

324
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:42,828
you can't come back.

325
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:45,998
I'll help you.

326
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:48,250
Then will you come and save me?

327
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,961
Come two days before the anniversary.

328
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:53,797
I know the date, too.

329
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,348
-I'm sorry about--
-There's no point saying that.

330
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,559
It doesn't change the fact
that he died because of you.

331
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:14,443
Don't die because of me.

332
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,072
I'm...

333
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,449
not your mother.

334
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,222
I'll come and escort you later.

335
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,105
When will you leave?

336
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:24,388
Ms. Jeong Tae-eul's guardian? She's ready.

337
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,308
It's me. I'm her guardian.

338
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:37,693
<i>Yeong, just for today.</i>

339
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:42,322
<i>Just until she can wash her face
on her own.</i>

340
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,201
I should thank Luna.

341
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,955
I get to stay with you
because she stabbed me.

342
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,500
Don't say such a thing.

343
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:55,794
All right?

344
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,589
Don't you know how startled I was?

345
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,134
Put my hair back to how it was.

346
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:05,637
My hairstyle is what makes me look pretty.

347
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:11,560
Let me see.

348
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,252
What did you pray for?

349
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:42,049
I didn't pray. I threatened.

350
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:44,843
I told him to stop being so harsh.

351
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:46,720
We didn't do anything that bad.

352
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:48,347
I asked

353
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,392
if we really have God's blessing.

354
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,745
I've never seen an adult who couldn't
order food using an app.

355
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,665
Do you have any messages for the owner?

356
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,544
Do I have to?

357
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,257
Thank you, I'll enjoy the food.

358
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,511
Enjoy your food.

359
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,097
What's this?

360
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:33,267
You said you wanted
convenience store food today.

361
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:35,894
Did you know you can get these delivered?

362
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:39,314
It was pretty easy to order this.

363
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:44,152
I saw you getting scolded by a little kid.

364
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:46,738
Wow, there's a lot of meat.

365
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,782
He was just explaining really loudly.

366
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,202
Here.

367
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,540
What should I do?

368
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:01,420
I was told to get lots of rest,
so I can't pick up the spoon.

369
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:06,717
My goodness.

370
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:13,015
-Meat.
-Okay.

371
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,812
Is it good?

372
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:21,899
It's good.

373
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:26,987
This is nice.

374
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:29,197
Spending time like this.

375
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:31,825
Let's sneak out

376
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:33,911
after we eat.

377
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,538
Excuse me! Jeong Tae-eul is trying to--

378
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,750
What are you doing?

379
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:46,006
Eat up, and don't think
about sneaking out.

380
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,842
-Let's sneak out.
-Excuse me!

381
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:40,727
<i>Yeong.</i>

382
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,562
<i>Just for today.</i>

383
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,316
<i>Let me just say goodbye.</i>

384
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:49,653
Yes, Your Majesty.

385
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:51,571
I should, too.

386
00:34:07,493 --> 00:34:08,911
Thanks for this.

387
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:10,871
I got it dry cleaned.

388
00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:15,334
I told you to keep it. Why call me here?

389
00:34:20,631 --> 00:34:22,216
Thank you for everything.

390
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,301
Take care.

391
00:34:24,718 --> 00:34:26,011
You don't need to worry.

392
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:29,682
Live a long and healthy life
and don't get shot again.

393
00:34:31,433 --> 00:34:34,561
Well, people all meet and part
throughout their lives.

394
00:34:37,022 --> 00:34:38,982
Goodbye. I won't see you off.

395
00:34:39,942 --> 00:34:41,360
Make sure to get a driver's license.

396
00:34:42,569 --> 00:34:44,113
If you do,

397
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,907
what will your 65th dream be?

398
00:34:47,825 --> 00:34:48,826
My dream?

399
00:34:50,828 --> 00:34:51,704
Well,

400
00:34:52,788 --> 00:34:53,747
I don't have

401
00:34:54,915 --> 00:34:56,125
anything like that anymore.

402
00:34:56,667 --> 00:34:57,918
I think you do.

403
00:35:00,546 --> 00:35:01,672
All right, then.

404
00:35:02,756 --> 00:35:04,675
-Bye.
-Already? You're leaving now?

405
00:35:06,802 --> 00:35:08,512
I do!

406
00:35:08,971 --> 00:35:10,222
I do have a dream.

407
00:35:15,102 --> 00:35:16,478
Seeing you again.

408
00:35:28,532 --> 00:35:29,575
Let's

409
00:35:31,201 --> 00:35:32,578
meet again someday.

410
00:35:40,169 --> 00:35:41,462
You have to promise.

411
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:44,882
You have to come back someday.

412
00:35:59,396 --> 00:36:02,524
You said this position
is actually really uncomfortable.

413
00:36:05,068 --> 00:36:06,570
Do you think I even tried it before?

414
00:36:07,196 --> 00:36:08,614
I just said that without thinking.

415
00:36:10,657 --> 00:36:12,826
Now that I've tried, it's really nice.

416
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:20,793
Let's...

417
00:36:23,462 --> 00:36:27,424
do everything we skipped someday.

418
00:36:29,468 --> 00:36:31,178
Let's travel together,

419
00:36:32,012 --> 00:36:33,764
watch movies,

420
00:36:34,681 --> 00:36:36,391
take photos together,

421
00:36:37,142 --> 00:36:38,685
-and--
-Jeong Tae-eul.

422
00:36:40,312 --> 00:36:41,355
Don't.

423
00:36:51,114 --> 00:36:52,616
If you're trying to say you need to go,

424
00:36:54,034 --> 00:36:55,244
don't.

425
00:36:58,497 --> 00:37:00,040
I'm not going to let you leave.

426
00:37:06,004 --> 00:37:07,130
Let's just not

427
00:37:08,298 --> 00:37:09,341
save the world.

428
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:14,346
Let's just go back and forth

429
00:37:16,098 --> 00:37:17,933
and only think about the present.

430
00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:29,653
I know what you're planning.

431
00:37:31,405 --> 00:37:32,865
You're thinking of going to the past.

432
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,286
You're going to try and catch Lee Lim
before he comes to this world.

433
00:37:49,381 --> 00:37:50,799
Then I won't

434
00:37:53,844 --> 00:37:55,554
be able to remember you.

435
00:38:00,267 --> 00:38:02,519
If our worlds flow differently
from the present,

436
00:38:08,525 --> 00:38:11,028
then I'll live without knowing you.

437
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,161
Our worlds

438
00:38:22,581 --> 00:38:24,583
have already gone so wrong.

439
00:38:29,004 --> 00:38:30,047
CREMATION OF PRINCE BUYEONG
LEE JONG-IN

440
00:38:34,134 --> 00:38:36,011
But Ji-hun died

441
00:38:37,387 --> 00:38:38,513
because of you.

442
00:38:39,932 --> 00:38:41,683
There are so many reasons

443
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,271
to change the past.

444
00:38:47,773 --> 00:38:48,941
And that

445
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,778
is the only way.

446
00:38:56,949 --> 00:38:58,116
So

447
00:39:01,244 --> 00:39:02,663
tell me to go.

448
00:39:04,706 --> 00:39:05,916
Tell me to leave.

449
00:39:07,876 --> 00:39:08,710
Please.

450
00:39:15,384 --> 00:39:17,094
I'm asking for someone's permission

451
00:39:19,638 --> 00:39:21,556
for the first time in my life.

452
00:39:31,525 --> 00:39:32,818
If you stop me,

453
00:39:36,029 --> 00:39:37,280
I can't leave.

454
00:39:53,672 --> 00:39:55,632
Tell me you'll come back.

455
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,469
That's the tenth rule.

456
00:40:04,391 --> 00:40:06,852
No matter what happens,
you have to come back.

457
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,231
That's the 11th rule.

458
00:40:15,569 --> 00:40:16,987
Catch Lee Lim,

459
00:40:18,613 --> 00:40:20,198
and even if the door closes,

460
00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:24,953
open all the doors in the universe

461
00:40:26,705 --> 00:40:27,748
and return to me.

462
00:40:27,831 --> 00:40:29,124
Promise me you'll do that.

463
00:40:31,334 --> 00:40:32,627
That's the 12th rule.

464
00:40:39,926 --> 00:40:40,969
I will.

465
00:40:44,681 --> 00:40:46,391
I'll open all the doors in the universe.

466
00:40:53,607 --> 00:40:54,775
And I promise

467
00:40:57,944 --> 00:40:59,863
I will return to you.

468
00:41:21,802 --> 00:41:23,845
If you ask someone
to meet at a place like this,

469
00:41:24,262 --> 00:41:26,139
you should be waiting here first.

470
00:41:26,807 --> 00:41:28,850
I was worried you'd be feeling dejected,

471
00:41:29,434 --> 00:41:30,769
but I guess there was no need.

472
00:41:33,522 --> 00:41:34,981
You can't become Queen,

473
00:41:35,524 --> 00:41:37,067
and you've been suspended.

474
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:40,362
It looks like you can't even get near
a high position now.

475
00:41:41,488 --> 00:41:45,450
So I'm thinking of going to a vast place
instead of a high place.

476
00:41:48,662 --> 00:41:51,581
Yours seems to be that umbrella.

477
00:41:51,665 --> 00:41:52,582
What about

478
00:41:54,376 --> 00:41:55,418
Lee Gon's?

479
00:41:57,587 --> 00:41:58,713
I want to take it.

480
00:42:00,382 --> 00:42:01,591
Wouldn't it be nice?

481
00:42:02,509 --> 00:42:04,427
We can each have one.

482
00:42:04,511 --> 00:42:06,054
There is a better way.

483
00:42:07,848 --> 00:42:09,558
You can have this as well.

484
00:42:11,143 --> 00:42:12,769
What are you trying to--

485
00:42:16,398 --> 00:42:18,942
I'm expressing my anger at you.

486
00:42:20,485 --> 00:42:23,029
What I wanted from you was simple.

487
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,449
Get Lee Gon or get the Kingdom of Corea.

488
00:42:27,284 --> 00:42:30,245
But you've lost both.

489
00:42:31,705 --> 00:42:34,082
There is only one way for you to live now.

490
00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:37,502
Find a way for me to attend
the memorial mass

491
00:42:38,003 --> 00:42:40,505
for Lee Gon's mother
that will be held soon.

492
00:42:41,548 --> 00:42:43,091
You, me,

493
00:42:43,592 --> 00:42:46,428
and the late Queen
who will be raised from the dead.

494
00:42:47,721 --> 00:42:50,640
I am going to announce at the mass
that there are two worlds,

495
00:42:51,725 --> 00:42:54,144
the Kingdom of Corea
and the Republic of Korea.

496
00:43:09,701 --> 00:43:13,079
I guess my nephew has finally turned up.

497
00:43:14,372 --> 00:43:16,625
RELICS EXHIBITION
KINGDOM OF COREA

498
00:43:46,029 --> 00:43:47,197
Where did he go?

499
00:43:53,328 --> 00:43:54,371
What is this?

500
00:44:06,216 --> 00:44:09,594
Your Majesty, what...

501
00:44:10,512 --> 00:44:12,973
My goodness. What happened?

502
00:44:16,935 --> 00:44:17,936
Your Majesty.

503
00:44:19,562 --> 00:44:21,106
Thank you

504
00:44:23,483 --> 00:44:24,609
for letting me go back then.

505
00:44:25,235 --> 00:44:26,486
I know.

506
00:44:27,362 --> 00:44:29,489
I know, Your Majesty.

507
00:44:40,458 --> 00:44:41,918
What about Uncle's funeral rite?

508
00:44:42,919 --> 00:44:45,213
I'm sure people would've talked
about my absence.

509
00:44:45,714 --> 00:44:47,424
We announced that it was done privately

510
00:44:47,507 --> 00:44:50,593
and that you were grieving alone.

511
00:44:51,344 --> 00:44:53,138
The bereaved all left the country

512
00:44:53,221 --> 00:44:55,807
and Lee Seung-heon
is leaving in four hours.

513
00:45:02,647 --> 00:45:05,483
Does he limp by any chance?

514
00:45:06,109 --> 00:45:07,736
Yes, he does.

515
00:45:12,574 --> 00:45:14,159
Please check his current location.

516
00:45:14,993 --> 00:45:16,453
I will see him off myself.

517
00:45:33,261 --> 00:45:35,347
Those crazy jerks!

518
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,143
Damn it!

519
00:45:47,192 --> 00:45:48,318
Your Majesty?

520
00:45:48,401 --> 00:45:52,405
We finished the funeral rite
and did everything to embarrass ourselves.

521
00:45:52,489 --> 00:45:55,658
What are you doing here
when it's all over?

522
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,788
Don't you remember me?
From the night of the treason.

523
00:46:01,122 --> 00:46:02,332
At the back gate of the palace.

524
00:46:12,342 --> 00:46:14,219
The man who shot your leg.

525
00:46:20,141 --> 00:46:21,434
What...

526
00:46:22,352 --> 00:46:24,104
How do you have this?

527
00:46:24,187 --> 00:46:26,356
The best thing you did your whole life

528
00:46:27,774 --> 00:46:29,818
is the fact that you hid it well
from my uncle.

529
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:32,320
If he had known
that you were an accomplice,

530
00:46:33,446 --> 00:46:34,614
he would've killed himself.

531
00:46:36,408 --> 00:46:40,036
You will never be able to return
to this kingdom, even after your death.

532
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:40,995
Wait.

533
00:46:41,621 --> 00:46:43,123
Please hear me out, Your Majesty.

534
00:46:43,206 --> 00:46:44,541
Prince Buyeong's son Lee Seung-heon

535
00:46:44,624 --> 00:46:47,168
is to be exiled
from the Kingdom of Corea permanently.

536
00:46:47,252 --> 00:46:48,670
Yes, Your Majesty.

537
00:46:51,005 --> 00:46:52,841
Your Majesty, wait!

538
00:46:54,092 --> 00:46:55,135
Gon!

539
00:46:56,094 --> 00:46:57,178
Your Majesty!

540
00:46:58,555 --> 00:46:59,639
Gon!

541
00:47:02,767 --> 00:47:04,894
Please change into this.
It's an order from the King.

542
00:47:35,467 --> 00:47:36,426
Is it really you,

543
00:47:37,135 --> 00:47:38,344
Hyeon-min?

544
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:43,516
It's me, your mom. Can you recognize me?

545
00:47:50,607 --> 00:47:51,900
It was the only thing

546
00:47:53,026 --> 00:47:54,736
I could do back then.

547
00:47:58,406 --> 00:48:00,492
I'm sorry. I really am.

548
00:48:06,331 --> 00:48:07,707
Did you lose me

549
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:09,667
or abandon me?

550
00:48:11,878 --> 00:48:12,754
Did you lose me

551
00:48:13,755 --> 00:48:16,341
by accident or did you let go of my hand?

552
00:48:19,219 --> 00:48:20,637
I wanted you to live.

553
00:48:22,347 --> 00:48:23,723
I wanted you to live a decent life.

554
00:48:28,311 --> 00:48:29,479
I didn't...

555
00:48:32,148 --> 00:48:33,316
get to live a decent life.

556
00:48:42,992 --> 00:48:43,993
Don't

557
00:48:45,078 --> 00:48:46,079
get your hopes up.

558
00:48:48,122 --> 00:48:50,625
And don't ask me for forgiveness.

559
00:48:53,586 --> 00:48:54,921
I just wanted

560
00:48:57,257 --> 00:48:58,424
to see you once.

561
00:49:01,261 --> 00:49:02,470
I want to wake up

562
00:49:04,389 --> 00:49:05,932
from a bad dream.

563
00:49:09,769 --> 00:49:10,895
Stay healthy.

564
00:49:13,356 --> 00:49:14,482
This time,

565
00:49:15,942 --> 00:49:17,360
I'm the one abandoning you.

566
00:49:46,806 --> 00:49:51,019
I thought kings had
grander meals than this.

567
00:49:52,103 --> 00:49:53,938
It depends on who I'm eating with.

568
00:49:55,773 --> 00:49:57,191
They set the table to suit you.

569
00:50:00,153 --> 00:50:01,404
You have more drinks, right?

570
00:50:10,872 --> 00:50:12,665
Thank you for today.

571
00:50:14,834 --> 00:50:16,919
Your mother won't be harmed.

572
00:50:19,505 --> 00:50:22,508
Now I've paid you back for the meal.

573
00:50:25,637 --> 00:50:26,763
Thank you for that, too.

574
00:50:28,056 --> 00:50:28,973
Where will you go now?

575
00:50:30,558 --> 00:50:31,684
Are you going to stay?

576
00:50:32,185 --> 00:50:33,102
Or will you

577
00:50:34,062 --> 00:50:34,937
go back?

578
00:50:36,314 --> 00:50:37,565
What about you?

579
00:50:38,608 --> 00:50:40,151
Are you really going back to that night?

580
00:50:41,944 --> 00:50:43,237
-I should.
-If you do,

581
00:50:43,321 --> 00:50:44,947
are you sure you can catch Lee Lim?

582
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:47,241
It's possible if I only target Lee Lim.

583
00:50:48,284 --> 00:50:50,328
The moment he chokes me.

584
00:50:52,914 --> 00:50:57,543
He'll be defenseless then since
he'll be focused on his anger.

585
00:50:59,212 --> 00:51:00,505
Why didn't you do that before?

586
00:51:03,966 --> 00:51:05,510
You'll regret asking me if I told you.

587
00:51:10,348 --> 00:51:12,058
I broke the dome glass

588
00:51:13,476 --> 00:51:15,937
and set off the alarm
to grab everyone's attention.

589
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,816
because I wanted to save the young me.

590
00:51:21,109 --> 00:51:24,028
So you won't save yourself this time?

591
00:51:24,862 --> 00:51:28,449
-Then you'll disappear.
-If I succeed,

592
00:51:30,243 --> 00:51:32,620
all your time spent
in the Republic of Korea will disappear.

593
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,791
I'll be returning things to before
Kang Hyeon-min met Lee Lim.

594
00:51:39,502 --> 00:51:42,880
So you have to make a choice
you won't regret.

595
00:51:43,881 --> 00:51:44,966
I'm saying this

596
00:51:46,509 --> 00:51:48,386
because this is your
last chance to kill me.

597
00:51:59,689 --> 00:52:01,190
I should've poisoned your drink.

598
00:52:05,653 --> 00:52:08,489
Does Tae-eul know your plan too?

599
00:52:13,244 --> 00:52:14,537
She can't.

600
00:53:45,378 --> 00:53:46,462
You let your guard down.

601
00:53:50,383 --> 00:53:51,676
Ms. Baek!

602
00:53:56,389 --> 00:53:57,557
You bitch.

603
00:53:58,766 --> 00:54:00,977
How dare you!

604
00:54:07,066 --> 00:54:08,192
You fool.

605
00:54:08,943 --> 00:54:10,403
Did you pray?

606
00:54:13,781 --> 00:54:17,159
I prayed every day for God to kill me.

607
00:54:18,202 --> 00:54:19,287
And finally...

608
00:54:24,834 --> 00:54:26,419
I'm going to die.

609
00:54:28,379 --> 00:54:29,463
I'm finally

610
00:54:30,673 --> 00:54:32,091
going to die.

611
00:56:09,647 --> 00:56:11,357
I even transcended death,

612
00:56:12,608 --> 00:56:15,945
but how is it that I'm unable
to avoid you?

613
00:56:17,113 --> 00:56:19,448
How did you find me here?

614
00:56:20,032 --> 00:56:21,617
It would've been easy if it were just me.

615
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:23,035
But

616
00:56:24,203 --> 00:56:25,287
I'm not alone.

617
00:56:26,539 --> 00:56:28,207
Someone sets the time,

618
00:56:28,791 --> 00:56:29,917
someone chases after you,

619
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:32,920
someone prays for you to get caught,

620
00:56:34,005 --> 00:56:35,172
and someone

621
00:56:36,716 --> 00:56:38,050
is going to fight you.

622
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:42,805
How dare you

623
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,183
try to attend my mother's memorial mass?

624
00:56:46,267 --> 00:56:48,310
You should've waited for me there.

625
00:56:48,686 --> 00:56:50,813
We should've met there.

626
00:56:52,189 --> 00:56:53,607
This can't happen.

627
00:56:54,608 --> 00:56:56,736
I can't let things end like this.

628
00:57:00,448 --> 00:57:01,574
Time won't flow again

629
00:57:02,825 --> 00:57:04,035
for a while.

630
00:57:09,665 --> 00:57:12,209
At first, it was only 22 steps.

631
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,712
You've stopped the world

632
00:57:15,421 --> 00:57:17,298
that I am supposed to have.

633
00:57:17,882 --> 00:57:19,341
You postponed death

634
00:57:20,092 --> 00:57:22,261
for 25 years by using the Manpasikjeok,

635
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:23,846
so now the world is dying.

636
00:57:25,056 --> 00:57:28,350
That is why this fight must end now.

637
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:34,166
This can't be.

638
00:58:43,676 --> 00:58:44,927
Is something wrong?

639
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:11,370
You can't open my door.
I'm sure you expected that.

640
00:59:12,663 --> 00:59:15,499
The Manpasikjeok was soaked with my blood.

641
00:59:39,273 --> 00:59:40,649
You two wait here.

642
01:00:10,054 --> 01:00:12,014
They're the obelisks of my father.

643
01:00:14,266 --> 01:00:16,143
I've finally witnessed it
with my own eyes.

644
01:00:17,186 --> 01:00:21,565
The moment I've been waiting for
has finally arrived.

645
01:00:26,195 --> 01:00:27,655
I cannot hear the flute.

646
01:00:29,782 --> 01:00:31,283
The Manpasikjeok isn't crying.

647
01:00:31,367 --> 01:00:33,661
You have eternity and infinity
in your hands now.

648
01:00:33,744 --> 01:00:34,954
Don't be absurd.

649
01:00:35,454 --> 01:00:38,666
Of course, it's not crying.
It's whole again at last.

650
01:00:39,959 --> 01:00:41,460
Forget about the treason.

651
01:00:42,419 --> 01:00:43,337
We should go inside.

652
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:44,880
Just the two of us.

653
01:00:46,548 --> 01:00:47,800
It's not crying.

654
01:00:48,384 --> 01:00:49,593
If it doesn't cry,

655
01:00:50,552 --> 01:00:52,429
I can't go back to the night
of the treason.

656
01:00:53,305 --> 01:00:54,348
I must

657
01:00:56,308 --> 01:00:57,601
make the crack again.

658
01:00:58,644 --> 01:01:01,021
You mean you have to
give him back his piece?

659
01:01:01,105 --> 01:01:02,231
I don't need it anymore.

660
01:01:02,815 --> 01:01:04,984
It's finally whole again.

661
01:01:06,235 --> 01:01:08,654
Eternity and infinity
are waiting for us in there,

662
01:01:09,863 --> 01:01:13,200
and you're just going to use that
to go back to the night of the treason?

663
01:01:13,284 --> 01:01:15,035
I don't need eternity and infinity.

664
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,204
You will

665
01:01:18,247 --> 01:01:19,498
never see

666
01:01:20,499 --> 01:01:21,792
nor own that place.

667
01:01:23,168 --> 01:01:24,712
You fool.

668
01:01:27,214 --> 01:01:28,716
Fine. Try it, then.

669
01:01:29,466 --> 01:01:32,636
You can ask or order me to go and die.

670
01:01:33,345 --> 01:01:35,389
You can open your own door,

671
01:01:35,472 --> 01:01:38,851
but you'd need someone to escort me
past my door.

672
01:01:38,934 --> 01:01:40,269
Who would it be?

673
01:01:40,352 --> 01:01:43,188
Who will you order to die in there?

674
01:01:43,272 --> 01:01:44,481
Shut up.

675
01:01:45,232 --> 01:01:47,401
You have not transcended death.

676
01:01:49,361 --> 01:01:50,988
You've postponed punishment from the Gods.

677
01:01:52,197 --> 01:01:54,491
With your taunting added,

678
01:01:56,493 --> 01:01:58,245
I'll make sure you die a miserable death.

679
01:01:58,912 --> 01:02:01,957
I'll stay and go with him.

680
01:02:02,499 --> 01:02:04,626
No, I'll go.
Do I just have to go with this jerk?

681
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:07,671
Your Majesty, I'll get rid of the traitor
with my own hands.

682
01:02:08,339 --> 01:02:11,425
I told you many times.
Get lost and go to your own world.

683
01:02:12,468 --> 01:02:14,178
Give me the piece. When should I go?

684
01:02:47,711 --> 01:02:49,671
How far do you want me to go?

685
01:02:52,841 --> 01:02:54,051
How far?

686
01:02:56,512 --> 01:02:57,805
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

687
01:03:00,891 --> 01:03:02,893
-Did you get discharged?
-What happened?

688
01:03:03,352 --> 01:03:06,188
How did you catch Lee Lim?

689
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:09,566
I tracked down Song Jeong-hye.

690
01:03:10,359 --> 01:03:12,528
And she's dead.

691
01:03:13,237 --> 01:03:14,613
I just confirmed she has no family.

692
01:03:17,574 --> 01:03:19,076
Maybe we should've been there for her.

693
01:03:21,412 --> 01:03:23,080
We need to question him. Come inside.

694
01:03:32,172 --> 01:03:36,635
LATE SONG JEONG-HYE

695
01:04:24,892 --> 01:04:25,767
Secretary Mo.

696
01:04:27,019 --> 01:04:27,853
Please announce

697
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:31,899
Se-jin as first in line to the throne
tomorrow morning.

698
01:04:33,984 --> 01:04:36,153
-Your Majesty.
-If anything happens to me,

699
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:38,697
Prince Buyeong's granddaughter Lee Se-jin

700
01:04:41,867 --> 01:04:43,619
will succeed to the throne.

701
01:04:45,078 --> 01:04:46,371
Your Majesty.

702
01:06:05,242 --> 01:06:06,535
Where is the Manpasikjeok?

703
01:06:06,618 --> 01:06:07,578
No,

704
01:06:09,121 --> 01:06:10,330
who has it right now?

705
01:06:11,206 --> 01:06:12,541
Did you come here to die too?

706
01:06:13,709 --> 01:06:14,918
You're going to go and die?

707
01:06:15,002 --> 01:06:16,545
Just answer my question.

708
01:06:17,963 --> 01:06:19,256
Where's the Manpasikjeok?

709
01:06:19,339 --> 01:06:21,341
You should be scared!

710
01:06:21,425 --> 01:06:24,136
Why are you idiots making such choices?

711
01:06:24,219 --> 01:06:25,470
Why?

712
01:06:26,179 --> 01:06:27,347
I am scared.

713
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:29,725
I'm scared he'll be lonely by himself.

714
01:06:31,393 --> 01:06:32,644
I'm scared

715
01:06:33,395 --> 01:06:35,063
that our worlds will continue like this.

716
01:06:36,023 --> 01:06:37,274
So make a choice, too.

717
01:06:38,442 --> 01:06:40,360
Wouldn't it be better
if you went there with me?

718
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:43,947
This is your last chance.

719
01:06:45,073 --> 01:06:47,409
Who has the Manpasikjeok?

720
01:06:48,410 --> 01:06:50,454
If that's what you're afraid of,

721
01:06:52,497 --> 01:06:54,291
I must have not taught you anything.

722
01:06:55,834 --> 01:07:00,005
I've sent hell to my nephew
and Prime Minister Koo.

723
01:07:02,341 --> 01:07:05,469
<i>Prince Buyeong's granddaughter
Lee Se-jin, who was residing in LA,</i>

724
01:07:05,552 --> 01:07:08,055
<i>died this morning in a car accident.</i>

725
01:07:08,305 --> 01:07:09,598
<i>Park Ji-yeong, the granddaughter</i>

726
01:07:09,681 --> 01:07:12,142
<i>of Hogyeong Pharmaceuticals' founder,
caused the accident.</i>

727
01:07:12,225 --> 01:07:15,395
<i>The fact that she was pregnant
and due soon</i> <i>has caused even more shock.</i>

728
01:07:16,313 --> 01:07:17,773
<i>Ms. Park was in LA</i>

729
01:07:17,856 --> 01:07:20,067
<i>to meet with friends
before her due date...</i>

730
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:23,153
He used Ji-yeong to do that?

731
01:07:25,447 --> 01:07:28,825
<i>The White House has stated...</i>

732
01:07:38,669 --> 01:07:39,795
Mom?

733
01:07:41,254 --> 01:07:42,297
Mom.

734
01:07:44,966 --> 01:07:46,301
Mom, what did you

735
01:07:47,511 --> 01:07:49,096
eat for dinner today?

736
01:07:50,764 --> 01:07:51,765
Dinner?

737
01:07:52,516 --> 01:07:54,184
Didn't you eat dinner yet?

738
01:07:55,018 --> 01:07:56,269
Are you busy?

739
01:07:56,478 --> 01:07:58,814
<i>Mom, come on. Answer me.</i>

740
01:08:01,858 --> 01:08:03,694
What did you have for dinner?

741
01:08:05,112 --> 01:08:06,613
<i>I ordered </i>jjajangmyeon.

742
01:08:08,448 --> 01:08:10,575
<i>Why? Is there something you want to eat?</i>

743
01:08:35,475 --> 01:08:36,768
What's going on?

744
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:40,939
Are you letting me go too
since I'm going to die?

745
01:08:43,817 --> 01:08:45,527
I still have a bit more time.

746
01:08:46,528 --> 01:08:48,196
Don't live just a bit. Live a long life.

747
01:08:49,114 --> 01:08:51,491
Or else my dad will be upset.

748
01:08:52,075 --> 01:08:53,326
Just get to the point.

749
01:08:54,703 --> 01:08:57,497
I'm going to go somewhere.
It might take a long time.

750
01:08:59,332 --> 01:09:02,002
Protect my dad while I'm gone
as Jeong Tae-eul.

751
01:09:03,253 --> 01:09:05,672
And steal something for me before that.

752
01:09:22,522 --> 01:09:24,316
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

753
01:09:25,442 --> 01:09:26,943
They put me back in one piece.

754
01:09:27,861 --> 01:09:28,945
Hey!

755
01:09:38,497 --> 01:09:39,664
What happened?

756
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:42,209
The door looks fine. How did she run away?

757
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:47,506
I let her go a while ago.

758
01:09:49,216 --> 01:09:50,300
Why?

759
01:09:51,051 --> 01:09:53,220
You have the Manpasikjeok, right?

760
01:09:54,763 --> 01:09:55,680
Give it to me.

761
01:09:58,391 --> 01:09:59,976
I don't. What is that?

762
01:10:01,061 --> 01:10:02,395
I have Lee Lim.

763
01:10:04,523 --> 01:10:06,650
Why would you have brought Lee Lim
to the station?

764
01:10:07,567 --> 01:10:10,987
We can't punish him under our law anyway.

765
01:10:12,322 --> 01:10:14,741
It's because you need to keep him safe
for 48 hours.

766
01:10:14,991 --> 01:10:16,034
You must have promised

767
01:10:17,035 --> 01:10:18,495
to bring Lee Lim

768
01:10:19,788 --> 01:10:21,665
to the bamboo forest in 48 hours.

769
01:10:25,544 --> 01:10:26,711
Give me the Manpasikjeok.

770
01:10:27,128 --> 01:10:28,839
-I have to go there.
-I won't let you.

771
01:10:29,923 --> 01:10:30,799
You can't.

772
01:10:31,842 --> 01:10:32,759
If you go,

773
01:10:34,219 --> 01:10:35,846
you might not come back. Why would you go?

774
01:10:37,931 --> 01:10:39,015
I don't think

775
01:10:40,684 --> 01:10:43,311
I can remain here and endure it alone.

776
01:10:45,272 --> 01:10:46,565
Don't make me do that.

777
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:50,193
Please.

778
01:10:51,486 --> 01:10:52,529
Give it to me.

779
01:10:53,613 --> 01:10:55,073
Don't you get it?

780
01:10:56,741 --> 01:10:58,368
I'm not letting you go.

781
01:11:11,381 --> 01:11:13,466
I wanted to keep this secret to the grave,

782
01:11:15,093 --> 01:11:17,345
but I guess I have no choice
but to tell you the truth.

783
01:11:24,477 --> 01:11:26,062
I have feelings for you, Tae-eul.

784
01:11:28,189 --> 01:11:30,609
I've had feelings for you and you alone
my whole life.

785
01:11:33,028 --> 01:11:35,071
For every second until now,

786
01:11:36,907 --> 01:11:38,408
I've liked you.

787
01:11:40,952 --> 01:11:42,454
So how can I let you go?

788
01:11:44,581 --> 01:11:46,333
How can I just let you die?

789
01:11:48,501 --> 01:11:49,794
Don't be ridiculous and go home.

790
01:11:59,095 --> 01:12:00,138
Please...

791
01:12:02,766 --> 01:12:03,850
Give it to me.

792
01:12:07,812 --> 01:12:09,356
I won't apologize

793
01:12:10,982 --> 01:12:12,776
for not having known how you felt.

794
01:12:15,070 --> 01:12:16,863
If I say I feel bad for you now,

795
01:12:18,114 --> 01:12:19,240
I'd be a hypocrite.

796
01:12:22,535 --> 01:12:23,495
But

797
01:12:25,372 --> 01:12:27,332
just like your feelings for me,

798
01:12:30,335 --> 01:12:32,045
I also like someone a lot.

799
01:12:35,632 --> 01:12:39,928
I promise I'll come back and make up
for all the times I upset you.

800
01:12:43,723 --> 01:12:45,225
So just give it to me.

801
01:12:47,978 --> 01:12:49,354
Please, help me.

802
01:12:51,398 --> 01:12:52,607
If I don't go,

803
01:12:55,610 --> 01:12:57,988
I think I'll really die, Sin-jae.

804
01:13:45,076 --> 01:13:47,704
<i>God must have known</i>

805
01:13:48,872 --> 01:13:50,373
<i>that I would choose to kill Lee Lim</i>

806
01:13:51,791 --> 01:13:53,668
<i>instead of saving myself.</i>

807
01:13:59,257 --> 01:14:02,260
Are you going somewhere special,
Your Majesty?

808
01:14:03,762 --> 01:14:05,597
You're wearing your ceremonial outfit.

809
01:14:25,408 --> 01:14:29,245
<i>That is why God had left the mark
on my shoulder.</i>

810
01:14:31,122 --> 01:14:32,916
<i>It was so I would follow my destiny.</i>

811
01:14:34,417 --> 01:14:35,293
<i>How selfish.</i>

812
01:14:42,759 --> 01:14:45,470
-Your Majesty.
-I'm telling you first

813
01:14:46,638 --> 01:14:48,056
so you won't be anxious anymore.

814
01:14:49,933 --> 01:14:50,975
Tell me what?

815
01:14:55,188 --> 01:14:56,231
You

816
01:14:57,690 --> 01:14:58,942
must've been so lonely.

817
01:15:01,194 --> 01:15:02,529
You kept my secret

818
01:15:03,738 --> 01:15:05,406
and yours all to yourself.

819
01:15:09,577 --> 01:15:10,703
That book of poems

820
01:15:12,831 --> 01:15:14,624
was a gift for you.

821
01:15:16,459 --> 01:15:17,836
The lullaby

822
01:15:19,003 --> 01:15:22,090
you used to sing to me

823
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:24,634
was in that book.

824
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:30,849
The thought had crossed my mind,

825
01:15:32,475 --> 01:15:34,102
and it made me anxious.

826
01:15:36,229 --> 01:15:40,233
But why didn't you ask me about it?

827
01:15:42,152 --> 01:15:43,403
I thought you'd try to go back

828
01:15:45,738 --> 01:15:46,990
to your world.

829
01:15:49,409 --> 01:15:51,536
-Your Majesty...
-But thanks to you,

830
01:15:53,079 --> 01:15:54,873
I was able to read a beautiful poem.

831
01:15:57,417 --> 01:15:59,002
And I have a favor to ask you.

832
01:16:02,505 --> 01:16:03,673
Please let me go

833
01:16:06,009 --> 01:16:07,010
once again.

834
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:18,605
If I let you go,

835
01:16:22,275 --> 01:16:24,652
will you ever come back?

836
01:16:25,987 --> 01:16:27,071
You

837
01:16:30,241 --> 01:16:31,576
have to stay healthy.

838
01:16:34,537 --> 01:16:35,788
This is my last order.

839
01:16:38,917 --> 01:16:40,001
Your Majesty...

840
01:17:20,792 --> 01:17:22,377
Where are you going this time?

841
01:17:23,878 --> 01:17:25,713
-Yeong.
-Don't even think about it.

842
01:17:27,257 --> 01:17:29,842
Wherever you go, you can't go alone.

843
01:17:30,677 --> 01:17:31,719
I will go with you,

844
01:17:33,388 --> 01:17:34,264
no matter where it is,

845
01:17:35,598 --> 01:17:36,933
no matter what battlefield it is.

846
01:17:38,559 --> 01:17:41,187
Even more so if it's somewhere
you can't return from.
