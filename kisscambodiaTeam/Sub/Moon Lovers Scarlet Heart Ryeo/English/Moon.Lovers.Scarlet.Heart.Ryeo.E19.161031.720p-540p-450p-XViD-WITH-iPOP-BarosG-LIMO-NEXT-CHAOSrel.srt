<i>[Episode 19]</i>

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,600
You're not even feeling well,
so why are you out here?

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,540
Let's go back in.

7
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,460
Come with me.

8
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,940
I waited for you to talk to me today.

9
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,560
I cannot...

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,200
go back to that room.

11
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,220
Don't do this to me
because of Chae Ryung.

12
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,920
She fooled you.

13
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,720
She was never sincere with you,
not even once.

14
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,430
<i>I am doing well.</i>

15
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,440
Chae Ryung...

16
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,030
was sincere to me.

17
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,050
I don't care what you say to me.

18
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,660
She was sincere.

19
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,750
Now what?

20
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,660
You're going to trust her over me?

21
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,440
I want to leave the palace.

22
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,890
I want to leave this place.

23
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,480
I cannot...

24
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,650
bear this any longer.

25
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,130
What about me?

26
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,690
Do you think I'll let you go?

27
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,160
You...

28
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,990
can never leave me.

29
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,490
<i>Can you completely turn on
your brother and family?</i>

30
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,490
<i>If you become my only queen...</i>

31
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,620
<i>then I will make our child
the Crown Prince.</i>

32
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:06,410
Goryeo will belong to my son someday.

33
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,050
Please find Chae Ryung's family
and let them know.

34
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,310
This is everything that I have.

35
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,710
If they need anything else,
I will do what I can to get it.

36
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,880
You don't need to do this.

37
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,120
I am worried that
you will anger the king.

38
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,440
She was worrying about her family
even when she was dying.

39
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,650
She asked me for my help.

40
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,090
Even the king will not object.

41
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,240
Good job.

42
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,330
Hello, Ji Mong.

43
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,720
Chae Ryung has died.

44
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,140
Really?

45
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,180
You should not be so calm and composed.

46
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,110
It was your fault.

47
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,210
My fault?

48
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,640
You must be crazy.

49
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,060
You will regret it.

50
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,860
You treated someone like
Chae Ryung in that way.

51
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,160
I promise you that a day will come
when you will regret this.

52
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,790
Ever since you became the king's mistress

53
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,940
you think you can do whatever you please.

54
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,900
- Is that it?
- Mistress?

55
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,080
Your Majesty.

56
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,340
You asked for me?

57
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,900
I heard from Ji Mong.

58
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,920
I will have to proclaim you
a royal concubine.

59
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,400
There is no need for that.

60
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,110
It is better than
being called a mistress.

61
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,240
I don't like to hear it.

62
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,460
You will be treated as the wife
second only to the queen.

63
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,740
Once you have a child,
you will be proclaimed the second queen.

64
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,010
The reason I want to leave this place
is not because of those titles.

65
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,270
Discuss it with Ji Mong
and choose a title that you want.

66
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,460
Your Majesty.

67
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,610
You know that you can't,
so stop being so stubborn.

68
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,140
Let's not fight.

69
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,540
Have you forgotten how long we
had to be apart from each other?

70
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:47,040
I am only saying we should not waste
away our relationship over a small fight.

71
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,340
He is going to read all of "Essentials
of Government in the Zhenguan Reign"?

72
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,650
I don't know what he is planning.

73
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,900
I think I should get him a hawk.

74
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,380
Get one that is good at hunting
and very agile while you are at it.

75
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,410
I don't know what he is up to.

76
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,180
He wants to go out and hunt.

77
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,540
I should go along with it.

78
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,160
Wook, you know our 4th brother well.

79
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,480
You can never trust him
or let your guard down with him.

80
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,020
You have to cut off his arms and legs.

81
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,380
Are you referring to Baek Ah?

82
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,040
He keeps company with a
gisaeng from the Gyobang.

83
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,720
It will be easy to get him
away from the king.

84
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,570
What's holding you back now?

85
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,730
We've already had you
registered to a different family.

86
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,130
My mother is waiting to meet you.

87
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,620
It's because of what happened
last time, isn't it?

88
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,420
I have already said we should
emancipate all the slaves from Hubaekje.

89
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,240
That will not happen again.

90
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,720
<i>[Runaway slaves]</i>
Why don't people from Hubaekje pay taxes?

91
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,690
Why are they like that? Goodness.

92
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,870
The slaves from Baekje have
already set fire to 10 homes.

93
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,650
There are many members of
powerful families who have died.

94
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,870
We cannot just sit and watch anymore.

95
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,480
The families want you
to send out the soldiers.

96
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,010
If we send soldiers,
there will definitely be casualties.

97
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,250
It will not end with just slaves.

98
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:10,290
If any other foreigners join in,
this whole nation will be in chaos.

99
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,460
You should protect the families first!

100
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,010
Their lives are in immediate danger,
yet no soldiers come to help them.

101
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,440
They have started to
get their own people.

102
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,970
You must do this, Your Majesty.

103
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,640
You must save the powerful families
who are the foundation of this nation.

104
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,840
If so...

105
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,790
the soldiers must use spears
without knives and wooden swords.

106
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:38,050
I have not been on the throne long.
I want to avoid bloodshed if I can.

107
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:44,130
I propose that the 13th Prince
Baek Ah lead the soldiers.

108
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,810
Prince Baek Ah knows nothing
about the military or fighting.

109
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:49,970
Why would he do that?

110
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,440
There are rumors that His Majesty
does not care for the people of Goryeo

111
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,480
but cares more for Baek Ah of Silla
and the people of Baekje.

112
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,230
On top of everything

113
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:03,190
Baek Ah had a Baekje court lady adopted
into a Goryeo family and is marrying her.

114
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,260
I have already consented to that.

115
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,800
It could also mean that
someone close to the king

116
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,270
is being manipulated
by someone from Baekje.

117
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,570
You are making ridiculous accusations.

118
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,890
It only takes moments
for accusations to become truths.

119
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,400
They call that rumors
or... word of mouth.

120
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,270
I will not allow it.

121
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,760
You have only held a lute.
How can you wield a sword?

122
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,580
I do not like Woo Hee being under
suspicion for being from Baekje.

123
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,790
Because of us...

124
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,370
you have been troubled, Your Majesty.

125
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,600
It would be better if I stepped forward.

126
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,900
In order to get
the families to stand down

127
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,980
it seems they have left the area.

128
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:56,510
If you step in to take sides with either
the powerful families or the slaves

129
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,560
it will cause problems.

130
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,090
I am not going to die.

131
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,410
If we leave things like this...

132
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,770
we will be controlled by those families
and the throne will be in danger.

133
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,010
I will be fine.

134
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,130
You won't regret it?

135
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,860
I was pretending to be strong.

136
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,440
I don't know what will happen to me.

137
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:01,570
You'll have a wife, so you must survive.

138
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,810
I don't want to become a widow.

139
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,530
Once I come back...

140
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,460
let's get married.

141
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,030
You are my eternal companion.

142
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:35,690
<i>Right in this moment,
I wish I wasn't a daughter of Baekje.</i>

143
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,840
<i>With all my heart, I am your companion.</i>

144
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,650
Move!

145
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,050
Let's go!

146
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,390
There's something here.

147
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:04,530
I, the King of Goryeo, make this
promise to the people of Baekje.

148
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,860
Slaves will not be attacked.

149
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,920
In order to take care of this matter

150
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,570
I will do the right thing
and look into it.

151
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:22,050
<i>All those forced into slavery
by war will be freed.</i>

152
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:28,390
<i>Foreigners who were forced into slavery
will have their status re-instated.</i>

153
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,070
<i>This will be strictly enforced.</i>

154
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:35,700
<i>Slaves who were taken will be
returned to their original home region.</i>

155
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,280
<i>They will be exempted from taxes
for a time to be determined.</i>

156
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:43,950
<i>Receiving different treatment based on
your place of origin will be abolished.</i>

157
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,750
<i>You may be appointed
to work in government.</i>

158
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,810
<i>You will become a Goryeo citizen.</i>

159
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:56,040
They always lie with the same thing.

160
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,870
- Yeah.
- We won't be fooled. No, we won't!

161
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:03,260
They treated us like dogs and pigs!

162
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,360
Come on. Let's go!

163
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,530
Yeah!

164
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,490
You were sent home, so why are you here?

165
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,810
You'll lose your head.

166
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:37,300
Tell the king to do as he pleases.
I'm not afraid of anything.

167
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,760
I told you that he would
put you in a position to die.

168
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,550
He could have sent me.

169
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,280
Please do not die.

170
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,870
You can come back injured.

171
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,190
Just do not die.

172
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,510
I cannot watch any more of this.

173
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,680
You received what Hae Soo
asked me to send you?

174
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,330
The hairpin?

175
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,720
Yes.

176
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,720
However, I didn't know what it meant
because there was no letter.

177
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,170
She wanted me to tell you this, too.

178
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,910
"I want it."

179
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,270
"I want it"?

180
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,100
Did Hae Soo really say that?

181
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,970
Yes, that's what she said.

182
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,500
Hae Soo...

183
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,860
desperately wants it.

184
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,710
She told me to tell you.

185
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,460
I don't know what it is she wants.

186
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,300
Help her.

187
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,320
I don't know what will happen to me.

188
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:03,510
You should remain a good friend to Soo.

189
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,300
To the king, as well.

190
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,080
He's having a hard time.

191
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,990
Should you be worrying
about others right now?

192
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,950
No one is here to even see you off.

193
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,180
What about that court lady
from the Gyobang?

194
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,940
I told Woo Hee it would be
better if she didn't come.

195
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,590
Please take care yourself, Baek Ah.

196
00:15:55,550 --> 00:16:03,180
<i>[Reunification of the Three Kingdoms] [Goryeo, Baekje, and Silla]</i>

197
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,320
Woo Hee.

198
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,830
Princess! It's Princess Woo Hee.

199
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:18,890
Princess Woo Hee, be careful!
Come down from there.

200
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,410
You can't stand there.

201
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,070
Woo Hee!

202
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,070
Stop.

203
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,010
You're not going to, right?

204
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,310
Don't do it.

205
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,760
Turn around.

206
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,530
Turn around!

207
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,410
If you see...

208
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,030
you won't ever forget.

209
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,980
Woo Hee!

210
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,870
<i>I thought I could ignore it
and live my life.</i>

211
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,000
<i>I was going to deny my parents.</i>

212
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,700
<i>But I can't turn my back on my people
who look to me as a mother.</i>

213
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,810
<i>I don't think I can live like that.</i>

214
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,590
<i>Goryeo and Baekje.</i>

215
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,020
<i>Gyeon Hwon and Taejo Wang Geon.</i>

216
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,540
<i>Their sins...</i>

217
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,190
<i>I will pay for them with my lie.</i>

218
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:19,410
<i>Perhaps this is the reason I was born.</i>

219
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,230
<i>I...</i>

220
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,090
Woo Hee.

221
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,470
<i>love you.</i>

222
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,050
<i>You alone...</i>

223
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,760
<i>are my one and only companion.</i>

224
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:01,950
You shouldn't destroy yourself
just so you don't forget her.

225
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,660
Why didn't she tell me?

226
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,110
I must have made her that way.

227
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,170
If you think about it, I was too greedy.

228
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,110
A citizen of a fallen nation
and a former gisaeng.

229
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,290
An orphan.

230
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,730
I knew her painful background.

231
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,910
I felt proud of myself for loving her.

232
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,640
I was being narcissistic.

233
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,390
I didn't look back to see
how Woo Hee truly felt.

234
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,040
Why was she sad
and what made her so unhappy?

235
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,530
"Why are your smiles so brief?"

236
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,630
I never asked her.

237
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,920
It was a shallow love.

238
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,970
Woo Hee is the bad one here.

239
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,930
We gave our whole hearts to her.

240
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,410
In the end...

241
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,530
she was not selfish enough.

242
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,450
She is the bad one.

243
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,020
The king already knew everything.

244
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,630
Didn't he?

245
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,850
You look very haggard.

246
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,960
I will send you a doctor, so get treated.

247
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,550
The fact that Woo Hee displayed your tenets

248
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,360
means you had already
made a deal with her, right?

249
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,540
I did not know that she would choose to die.

250
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:16,370
She only told me that I could save you
if I wrote those tenets

251
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,090
That was when I found out that
she was a princess of Hubaekje.

252
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,080
I wanted to save you.

253
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,420
It was like grabbing on to
a rotting rope, but I wrote them.

254
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:30,350
I did not know what would happen,
but even if I had...

255
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,750
it would have been the same.

256
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,690
To me...

257
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,060
you are more important.

258
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,480
I know that.

259
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,080
I do know that.

260
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,770
But it is hard for me to accept.

261
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:56,300
It is hard being by your side,
Your Majesty.

262
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,130
Do not do this.

263
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,350
I...

264
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,010
I was wrong.

265
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,730
No, I was.

266
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:32,050
I am sorry that I was not enough
to protect you, Your Majesty.

267
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,840
Please live long and be healthy.

268
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,470
Brother.

269
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,690
Baek Ah.

270
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,810
Baek Ah!

271
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:33,050
Are you sure about your decision?

272
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,460
I am.

273
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,810
You mentioned going hunting.

274
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,970
- I got you a hunting hawk.
- Oh.

275
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:13,790
Hawk hunting is something
I enjoy very much.

276
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:23,480
This is a show of brotherly love.

277
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,570
They say that brotherly affection and
fraternity is the foundation of a man.

278
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,270
Wow! This is why brothers are the best.

279
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:33,580
Harmony in the family will mean
harmony in the country, don't you think?

280
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,220
Isn't this a dead hawk?

281
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,600
A dead hawk given to the king?

282
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,800
You have cursed the king!

283
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,670
We cannot let this slide.

284
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,730
Your Majesty.

285
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,770
It is a misunderstanding.

286
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:21,000
Something happened during
the transport of the hawk--

287
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,960
You brought it yourself,
so who are you blaming?

288
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,960
You are placing a curse on the king?

289
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,630
Then, is this treason?

290
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,920
Anyone can see that it is!

291
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,770
It is true, Your Majesty.

292
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,020
Your Majesty, I have been wronged.

293
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,060
I am clearly being framed, Your Majesty.

294
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,830
If it is treason...

295
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:09,320
you will have to pay with your life.

296
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,740
Your Majesty.

297
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,780
You are here?

298
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:41,350
Wook is being framed. He may die.

299
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,550
I heard that he committed a
grave error that is beyond repair.

300
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,950
You must save your brother.

301
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,600
I refuse.

302
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,800
Your Majesty.

303
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:04,000
I cannot get involved in politics
just to cover up my brother's crimes.

304
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,200
His crimes are too serious to do so.

305
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:09,940
The Hwangju elders are
already focused on me.

306
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,750
Do not have any expectations.

307
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,290
"Just"?

308
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:19,250
Did you use the word "just"
when referring to your brother's life?

309
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,440
I am the queen now.

310
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,750
I treasure my family
and I do not want to lose him.

311
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,220
However, we must look
at the bigger picture.

312
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,420
You need to let me go.

313
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,040
Forgive Wook.

314
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,180
I am certain that he was framed.

315
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,250
Let him live.

316
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,170
Your Majesty.

317
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,290
Don't you know you can't use your knees?

318
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:45,390
You may be unable to walk
if you do this. Get up now.

319
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,320
You said you wouldn't hurt your brothers.

320
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,460
Do not do this.

321
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,790
I know you care about the princes.

322
00:29:55,870 --> 00:30:01,010
I don't like how you're coming to me
and kneeling for his sake.

323
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,040
- Get up now.
- The person who killed the hawk...

324
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,460
was you, Your Majesty.

325
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:16,010
You killed the hawk on purpose and
now you've put Wook's life in danger.

326
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,650
What?

327
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,150
Is that wrong?

328
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,900
Wook killed our oldest brother and Eun.
He chased Baek Ah away, too.

329
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:41,420
He tried to kill me
and he tried to split us apart.

330
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,140
- That's the kind of person he is.
- If you kill anyone else...

331
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,490
it will return to you as bad luck.

332
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:50,090
If you are too severe
in giving out punishment

333
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,960
everyone will eventually
consider you the enemy.

334
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,480
In the future...

335
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:02,110
I do not want you to be
remembered as a bloody monarch.

336
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,280
Fine. I will let him live.

337
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:12,620
Wook will be punished by
being confined to his hometown.

338
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:17,600
He will not be allowed to take
even one step out of his home.

339
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,780
He had greed for Goryeo.

340
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,390
That house will become his entire world.

341
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:28,060
He will suffocate in that house.

342
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,980
He will have to live
until his heart rots.

343
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,790
If I think about it...

344
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:50,550
I suppose this suits him better
than killing him immediately.

345
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,540
You have time to play with flowers?

346
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:55,050
You are a hateful person.

347
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,790
I heard about Wook.

348
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,950
I know you must not feel good,
Your Majesty.

349
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:16,300
Ever since I was young,
he has never said no to me.

350
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,990
I wondered if I had destroyed him.

351
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,550
I worried about it a lot.

352
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,370
I pushed him to become king.

353
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:29,040
I wanted us to own this palace together.

354
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,750
I pushed him too hard.

355
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,880
However...

356
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,700
it wasn't me who completely
changed my brother.

357
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,380
It was you.

358
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,410
- Excuse me?
- I heard from Wook.

359
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,950
That you told him to
be careful of the 4th Prince.

360
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:56,890
You told him not to get in the way of
Prince Wang So and that he could die.

361
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,210
It's because...

362
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:07,690
I told him to be careful
of the 4th Prince?

363
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:12,710
After Wook heard that,
he believed the 4th Prince would be king.

364
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,810
He had feelings for you.

365
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:19,960
He hated it more than anything that you
were acknowledging another man as king.

366
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,570
I was the one who pressured Wook.

367
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,240
But it was you who hammered in the nail.

368
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,660
<i>Everything started with you.</i>

369
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:40,800
<i>I made the decision to kill my brothers
and become king.</i>

370
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,860
<i>All because you...</i>

371
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:49,560
<i>helped So cover up his scar
and take my seat.</i>

372
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,780
<i>Because he took what was mine...</i>

373
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,350
<i>Be careful of Prince Wang So.</i>

374
00:34:57,350 --> 00:35:00,300
<i>You must avoid him.
Do not ever get in his way.</i>

375
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,510
<i>If you do...</i>

376
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,750
<i>If you do, you will all die.</i>

377
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,240
It was all my fault...

378
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,600
If only you hadn't told him to
be careful of the 4th Prince...

379
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:24,140
If only you hadn't gotten involved and
said that the 4th Prince would be king...

380
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,220
Wook would not have changed so much
that it even shocked me.

381
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,410
You ruined everything.

382
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:37,070
And yet shamelessly, you still live.

383
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,990
<i>It's my favorite, Soo.</i>

384
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,620
<i>Mine is white tea.</i>

385
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,350
<i>It was my fault?</i>

386
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:46,180
You have to draw me to look the same.

387
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:50,300
I need it to feel like they're looking
at me even by looking at the drawing.

388
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,050
I thought we were drawing what you
would look like in your older years.

389
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,560
You're not sitting in your throne.

390
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,820
People wouldn't know
if you were a prince or king.

391
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,140
People would be confused.

392
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,250
I'm still very young.
Why draw a picture to hang after I die?

393
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,000
I have someone to give it to.

394
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:13,350
No. You cannot enter!

395
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,810
I am here to see you, Your Majesty.

396
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,590
You defy your exile so boldly.

397
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,750
You must be intent on dying.

398
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,050
I came because I need
your consent, Your Majesty.

399
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:40,260
I thought you would not allow me here
if I told you in advance.

400
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,770
This is a decre e left by the late king.

401
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:02,870
<i>I consent to the marriage of the sacred
Prince Jung and Court Lady Hae Soo.</i>

402
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,160
The borders have quieted down,
thanks to you.

403
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,630
I'll give you whatever you want
as an award before you leave.

404
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,570
Whatever I want?

405
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:15,990
As long as it's not the throne,
tell me what you want.

406
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,560
If so...

407
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:25,180
there is something I have
wanted for a very long time.

408
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,230
It is fake.

409
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,420
It's a lie.

410
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,090
You were enthroned without
even a last decree, Your Majesty.

411
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,800
Can you treat the late king's
decrees in this way?

412
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,770
You can compare this to
the late king's other writing.

413
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:57,030
You will be sure that
it was the late king.

414
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:00,540
Even if it is not fake,
I cannot approve it.

415
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,440
You cannot marry Hae Soo.

416
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,430
As long as the late king has consented,
there is no reason that I can't.

417
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:11,370
There is no one in this palace who
does not know about our relationship.

418
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:14,520
Yet, you want to marry her?

419
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,960
Enough with that nonsense.

420
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,450
Hae Soo is not a queen
nor is she a royal concubine.

421
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:23,060
She is not your wife.

422
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:27,330
There is no reason she cannot marry me.

423
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,810
Also, I have informed the
other ministers of this fact.

424
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:35,570
I let them know that I am waiting
for your consent to marry her.

425
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,690
Ji Mong.

426
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,070
Punish Prince Jung
for breaking his exile--

427
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,280
Hae Soo wants it.

428
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,930
What?

429
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:55,170
You can check with her.

430
00:39:56,110 --> 00:40:01,750
Hae Soo wants to marry me.

431
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,280
This is lacking honey, isn't it?

432
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,080
It will break down easily.

433
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,390
Use a flower scent for the wives.

434
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:25,010
Use grass or mint for
the princes and the king.

435
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:26,030
Yes.

436
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,400
Jung says...

437
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,230
he will marry you.

438
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:43,310
He had a decree from the late king
that gave him consent to marry you.

439
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,870
Did you know about it?

440
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,710
When did he receive that decree?

441
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,050
Year of the Monkey, September.

442
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,780
It was when Jung won a battle in Hwayi
against Khitan and returned.

443
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:04,370
Jung says you want marriage too.

444
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,890
I know you don't.

445
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,160
- I can dismiss that decree as a fake.
- I want it.

446
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,540
It is a grave sin to go against
the will of the late king.

447
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,500
If you do not adhere to it this time,
someone will definitely...

448
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:24,700
bring up your accession to the throne.

449
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:34,230
When we were apart,
we always longed for one another.

450
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,260
My heart got torn up
just thinking about you.

451
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,160
Now...

452
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,540
Although I see you daily and smile...

453
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,810
Sometimes, I even hate you.

454
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,390
You hate me?

455
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,170
If we keep on like this

456
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:57,760
it is obvious that someday,
only hate and disgust will be left.

457
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,120
I do not want that.

458
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,830
I would rather leave now.

459
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:07,930
I will never allow that.

460
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:51,410
People are already suspicious of how you
got on the throne, and you ignore this?

461
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,840
You made me turn on
my family and brother.

462
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:01,350
You cannot throw away
Hae Soo, Your Majesty?

463
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:02,450
That's right.

464
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,020
I can never let Hae Soo go.

465
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:11,310
How long will you be saying that?

466
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,240
I will wait and see.

467
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,570
You may throw away the throne.

468
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,860
But I can never do that.

469
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:55,300
You should get up now.

470
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,970
<i>The king has agreed to let you live.</i>

471
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:07,200
<i>What if people start suspecting you too?</i>

472
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:11,700
<i>It's not like...</i>

473
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,740
<i>you have any feelings left for me.</i>

474
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:21,310
<i>No matter who it was,
you know I would have done this.</i>

475
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:24,140
<i>The king knows that too.</i>

476
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,420
<i>Get over this now.</i>

477
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:38,150
<i>Be it towards the throne or me.</i>

478
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:41,545
<i>Unless you leave this place,</i>

479
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:44,750
<i>you can never break free from this misery.</i>

480
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,720
<i>You...</i>

481
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,210
<i>must give up first.</i>

482
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:52,800
You need to help me, Brother.

483
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,030
You have something you must tell me?

484
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,540
The queen begged me desperately.

485
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:17,470
That is why I made this exception.

486
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,280
Please wait outside, Your Majesty.

487
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:24,210
Brother.

488
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,720
I wish for nothing else.

489
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:39,580
Please listen to what my brother
has to say until the end.

490
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:53,490
I...

491
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:00,500
have something to confess about
my relationship with Hae Soo.

492
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,680
Hae Soo?

493
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:09,390
There seems to be something
you're still unaware of, Your Majesty.

494
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:11,370
I thought I should let you know.

495
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:15,250
The two of us...

496
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:20,470
had promised to marry one another.

497
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,470
Do you really want to die?

498
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:32,770
It was long before she became your woman.

499
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:37,740
Soo...

500
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,740
was my person.

501
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,120
I found out why you
worried so much about Wook.

502
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:07,470
Why it was that you got
on your knees to save Wook...

503
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,860
I know now.

504
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:16,880
That bracelet you wore for a long time.

505
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:19,800
The secret meetings at the Damiwon.

506
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,960
Is it all true?

507
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:29,200
Were you really planning
on marrying Wook?

508
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:33,370
Yes.

509
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:38,310
The person you told me you loved...

510
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,450
was it Wook?

511
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:46,990
Yes, it was.

512
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:56,800
<i>Also, there is someone that I like.</i>

513
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,050
<i>- Baek Ah?
- No, it's not Baek Ah.</i>

514
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:01,440
<i>I'll take her back.</i>

515
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,310
<i>If someone sees you two returning,
people will start talking.</i>

516
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:06,450
<i>Soo.</i>

517
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:13,690
<i>Nothing here is yours.</i>

518
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:16,490
<i>Not Yeon Hwa, and not Soo.</i>

519
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,860
<i>They are all my people.</i>

520
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,220
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

521
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:24,710
<i>You killed the hawk on purpose and
now you've put Wook's life in danger.</i>

522
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:29,360
Just lie to me instead.

523
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:34,270
Tell me it's a misunderstanding
and that Wook is lying to me!

524
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:38,250
Then we can go back to before.

525
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,540
We said...

526
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:46,400
we would not lie to one another.

527
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:48,690
How could you do this?

528
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,370
How could you hurt me like this?

529
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:54,390
Why is it Wook, of all people?

530
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:06,010
You always had Wook in your heart.

531
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:07,820
Your Majesty.

532
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:13,150
Do not touch me.

533
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,360
Starting today...

534
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:22,600
I will not see you ever again.

535
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:05,800
It was enough to give her up once.

536
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:11,030
I know they say you must sacrifice
in order to protect this throne.

537
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:15,190
But if you send her away like this,
you will lose yourself, as well.

538
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:20,750
I did not abandon her.

539
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,080
Soo...

540
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:34,520
abandoned me.

541
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,360
Bring it over.

542
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:00,550
We bonded over drinks,
so we should have a drink when we part.

543
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:08,130
Had I known Jung had that decree,
I wouldn't have helped you so easily.

544
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:09,790
I didn't know either.

545
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:14,260
He said he had a way out
of the palace. That's all I knew.

546
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,230
You don't like this marriage either.

547
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:19,170
You should turn back now, then.

548
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:21,070
I don't like the marriage.

549
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:24,400
But it's my only way out of the palace.

550
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:26,890
So I will do it.

551
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,900
At the very least,
I wanted you to stay with my brother.

552
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:37,414
Why are you trying to leave him

553
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:39,800
when you know you can't get over him?

554
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,030
There is too much blood
in our relationship.

555
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:46,250
I thought I could stop it.

556
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,100
I was wrong.

557
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:54,490
I have no confidence to
stand by and watch anymore.

558
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:58,490
I don't know everything there is
to know about your relationship.

559
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,690
I was very lucky to
become friends with you.

560
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:10,750
It was a precious relationship
that Lady Hae gave to us.

561
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:19,860
Don't let yourself
become sick with grieving.

562
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,050
You should go.

563
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:39,600
If you stay any longer,
I don't know what I'll do.

564
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,780
- What are the guards doing?
- Baek Ah.

565
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,490
Thank you.

566
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,230
I didn't do it with purely good intentions.

567
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:28,290
If you did not know
that I wanted to leave

568
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:32,410
I know you would
never have said those words.

569
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,150
Jung...

570
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:38,380
will be good to you.

571
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:45,280
Please take good care of yourself.

572
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:48,880
Since you are intent on leaving

573
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,090
cut things off cleanly.

574
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:57,690
Forget everything that has passed.

575
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:02,630
Think only of the future.

576
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:06,410
Think only of that.

577
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:30,240
Soo.

578
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:40,150
I think you should know my heart.

579
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:53,460
You should go now.

580
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:12,500
In this lifetime...

581
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:18,870
our intertwined fate ends here.

582
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:30,480
<i>If I had not met him</i>

583
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:34,030
<i>I would not yearn for him.</i>

584
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:37,780
<i>If I did not know him</i>

585
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:41,210
<i>I would not think of him so much.</i>

586
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:45,720
<i>If we had not been together,
I would not have to disappear.</i>

587
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:50,040
<i>If I did not treasure him so much,
I would not have so many memories.</i>

588
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:53,930
<i>If I did not love him...</i>

589
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:58,430
<i>we would not need to
throw each other away.</i>

590
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,100
<i>If we had not been face-to-face</i>

591
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:06,610
<i>we would never have been together.</i>

592
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,270
<i>Perhaps...</i>

593
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:14,870
<i>if I had not met you at all.</i>

594
00:59:31,450 --> 00:59:35,450
