<i>[Episode 3]</i>

4
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,840
She is my wife's cousin.

5
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,570
She has nothing to do with this,
so let her go.

6
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,140
I lost the assassin because of her.

7
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,390
Then, are you insisting on
spilling blood for no reason?

8
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,790
I... I had only lost my way.

9
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,410
Please believe me.

10
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:21,650
Why should I?

11
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,750
I don't know you.

12
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,100
So.

13
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:44,490
The palace guards are everywhere.
They will catch another assassin.

14
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,690
Then you will know she
has done nothing wrong.

15
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,770
Until then, for my sake...

16
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,440
let her go.

17
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,230
Are you all right?

18
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,110
Over there... there are many people.

19
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,180
They are all dead.

20
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,560
Dead?

21
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,760
They are all wearing those masks.

22
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,380
I should never have had the
4th Prince stand in my place.

23
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,300
He made his own choice to do this.

24
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,460
There is no need for you
to feel sorry, Crown Prince.

25
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,980
Do not say such things.

26
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,090
I have put my brother in danger.
If that is not wrong, what is?

27
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,370
He got injured, as well.

28
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,790
- Search the area now.
- Yes!

29
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,310
What is it that you saw?

30
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,660
Did the dead get up and
walk away on their own?

31
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,160
It was definitely here.

32
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,700
I know I'm right.
They were stabbed from behind.

33
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,090
It was right about here.

34
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,570
- Where did they all go?
- They were killed?

35
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,230
By whom?

36
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,810
- Tell me who it was.
- How am I supposed to know?

37
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,720
There was definitely a gang of assassins.

38
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,030
The leader of the assassin gang
killed off his own group.

39
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,730
It wasn't the palace guards?

40
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,720
Did you get any reports?

41
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,030
Seeing as how he took the bodies,
they planned this out very well.

42
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,550
That man was our very last witness.

43
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,550
He has died without a trace now.
What do you plan on doing?

44
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,870
Still...

45
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,860
I could not let Soo get hurt.

46
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,560
Once it gets bright out,
I will look for tracks.

47
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,220
Let's get you treated for now.

48
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,670
It's done now. Let's go back.

49
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,140
He's always saying he'll kill me.

50
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,240
Every time I see him,
he says that he's going to kill me.

51
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,740
I was only going to return
something that he left behind.

52
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,570
Soo.

53
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,350
It's going to be okay.

54
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,710
Oh my.

55
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,300
What if he really kills me?

56
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,510
He told that man to kill me before, too.
He just said to kill me.

57
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,330
He must have no tears or blood at all.

58
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,640
What did I ever do wrong?

59
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,390
Soo, everything will be fine.

60
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,150
That's enough now, Soo. It's all okay.

61
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,290
Stop now, okay?

62
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,800
Stop crying now and let's go home.

63
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,120
It's okay.

64
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,200
Where is the Crown Prince?

65
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,260
I am here, Your Majesty.

66
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,420
So.

67
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,140
Everything was ruined
because he got involved.

68
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,710
We should've been congratulating you
on becoming Crown Prince tonight.

69
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,760
We neatly tidied things up.

70
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,870
There are no assassins
who are still alive.

71
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,170
The king will be unable to
abdicate his throne for the time being.

72
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,330
Let's be satisfied with that.

73
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,430
I am surprised that So
stood in place of the Crown Prince.

74
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,810
Choi Ji Mong is also
difficult to predict.

75
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,780
The two of them most definitely have a
relationship that no one knows about.

76
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,360
It's just as Jung said.

77
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,270
So must have learned martial arts.

78
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,660
The Kangs would not have taught him.

79
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:03,590
I need to know who he has met
and what card he has up his sleeve.

80
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,880
Maybe if Choi Ji Mong is connected...

81
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,840
it could mean that the king is connected.

82
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,830
However, they say that no one ever
went to see him while he was in Shinju.

83
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,990
Keep a closer eye on him.

84
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,050
We should know what he is thinking in
order to chase him out or make him ours.

85
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,070
Do not forget.

86
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,440
Goryeo must belong to one of my sons.

87
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,130
This is not a job for you.

88
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,690
It is not something
a servant can do either.

89
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,640
How long do you plan on
staying in Shinju?

90
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,650
It would be good if you stayed
in Songak like the others

91
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,170
and learned from the teachers.

92
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,710
I'm different than Wook.

93
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,150
I prefer to live catching animals
in the mountains.

94
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,300
You've become adept at
hiding your inner thoughts.

95
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,540
That's good enough.

96
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,790
Make yourself comfortable
and get treatment.

97
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,970
I'll let the servants know.

98
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,370
Yeon Hwa.

99
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:59,440
I have often wondered what kind of woman
you had grown up to be.

100
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,530
What would you have done
if you had gotten seriously injured?

101
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,700
And why?

102
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,840
Why were you in that forest?

103
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,240
Well, the thing is...

104
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,250
I got lost.

105
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,870
They were people trying to
kill the Crown Prince.

106
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,020
- It's a relief she's alive.
- That's what I'm saying!

107
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,310
I felt that I was very lucky
for the first time today.

108
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:49,690
The fact that I only got hurt this much
is like a miracle.

109
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,890
Are you serious?

110
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,100
- Go and rest.
- Okay.

111
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,720
I'm not finished yet.

112
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,430
Thank you for saving Soo.

113
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:17,400
I apologize for always being
a burden to you, Your Highness.

114
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,780
What do you mean burden?

115
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,400
I have never thought of her that way.

116
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,820
In fact, she is a source of happiness.

117
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,630
She makes you happy?

118
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,890
This a very heavy household, is it not?

119
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,920
When people come to me,
they are always speaking of hardships.

120
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,340
They want so much from me.

121
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,850
But Soo is not like that.

122
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,480
She steps up to say she will
do everything on her own.

123
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,780
It makes me happy to see that.

124
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,500
It is a breath of fresh air.

125
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,480
I wait until I can see her again.

126
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:27,920
I am thankful that you
care so much for Soo.

127
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,530
Stop right there.

128
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,130
What is it?

129
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,180
What now?

130
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,710
I really told you everything I know.

131
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,110
I was busy running away.
What more could I have seen?

132
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,570
People with swords stabbed
the people with masks from behind.

133
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,630
It was all of a sudden.

134
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:40,540
Almost as if... as if they
had planned it beforehand.

135
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,000
Think harder. Remember everything.

136
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,250
Do it now!

137
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,400
That is enough now.

138
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,220
Fur outfit.

139
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,270
Everyone was wearing black clothes.

140
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,820
There was one man wearing fur.

141
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,750
He told them all to kill them.

142
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,810
Did you see his face?
What did he look like?

143
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,510
I didn't see his face.

144
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,320
He was definitely their leader.

145
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,560
That's how it seemed.

146
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,360
Who else knows about this?

147
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,870
No one else is bothering me besides you.

148
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,750
Forget everything you saw in the forest.

149
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,810
Forget that man.

150
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,690
Yes, Hae Soo. He is right.

151
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,950
You will only be safe if
no one finds out that you saw.

152
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,270
Then, can I leave now?

153
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,570
You.

154
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,050
Don't show up in front of me again.

155
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,670
What did I do wrong?

156
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,950
You told him to kill me.

157
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,530
You even said you'd kill me yourself.

158
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,470
Then, am I supposed to do nothing?

159
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,690
I should do whatever I can to live.
Am I supposed to just die?

160
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,460
Soo.

161
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:53,050
Is it a crime... to want to live?

162
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,230
Everyone wants to live.

163
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,070
Why are you picking on me?

164
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,950
You terrible jerk!

165
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,990
I think it would be best to
leave the lights on and sleep.

166
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,640
You went through something scary,
so it will help ease your dreams.

167
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,030
Are you okay, Prince Wook?

168
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,130
Me?

169
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,000
Yes, you.

170
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,900
Because of me...

171
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,080
you killed a man.

172
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,340
I'm worried that you
might have a bad dream.

173
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,960
You might get post-traumatic stress
or something.

174
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,890
I can't get bad dreams every time
something like this happens.

175
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,990
How difficult would that be?

176
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,850
Are you saying this happens often?

177
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,360
Then, you kill people...

178
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,590
I was 11 years old.

179
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,580
When I first took a life...

180
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,320
I was 11 years old.

181
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,750
A thief entered our quarters where
Yeon Hwa and my mother were.

182
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,340
Just like before...

183
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,250
I used my dagger.

184
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,260
However, I did not have any nightmares.

185
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,120
I protected my family with my own hands.

186
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,600
I was happy.

187
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,480
I was proud.

188
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:16,890
If a prince can't even do that,
then what good is he?

189
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,220
You still remember it though.

190
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,980
You can't forget it,
so how can you be comfortable with it?

191
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,840
It's obvious you are just
holding it in and living with it.

192
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:36,700
It is the burden I was born with,
so I will have to endure it.

193
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:42,010
I won't latch on to you, so don't worry.

194
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,050
What?

195
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:49,820
I shouldn't weigh you down
so that you can live lightly.

196
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,360
So, you don't need to worry about me.

197
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,430
I can live very well on my own.

198
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,040
You lost your memory.

199
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,990
Now it's been replaced by
a lot of false courage.

200
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,090
By the way...

201
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,170
What is this stre... stress?

202
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,680
<i>[Taejo 25th New Year (Year 942)]</i>

203
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,590
The Crown Prince was attacked in
the palace and in front of me, at that.

204
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:57,850
It was a clear attack on me,
and was proof that this is powerful foe.

205
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,710
<i>[Taejo Wang Geon]</i>

206
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:02,680
Ji Mong, what happened to
the tracking of the assassins?

207
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,370
The princes chased them,
but we could not catch one alive.

208
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,410
We are examining the corpses.

209
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,550
We will find any leads that we can.

210
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:15,680
Your Majesty, the assassins were all
acrobatic performers in Songak.

211
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,530
I will find out who
let them into the palace.

212
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,520
You do that.

213
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,910
How is your injury?

214
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,750
It was not a large wound.

215
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,910
I got it treated
at my 8th brother's home.

216
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,950
What is the reason you stood
in the Crown Prince's place?

217
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,490
Your life was in danger.

218
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:47,010
Crown Prince Moo
saved my life 15 years ago.

219
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:52,720
That is why I want to stay in Songak
and find out who is behind this plot.

220
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,130
You?

221
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:00,590
If you will permit it, Your Majesty.
I will find out who is behind it.

222
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,610
All right.

223
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,220
Ji Mong.

224
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,620
Inform Shinju that So has
some work to do on my behalf.

225
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,730
He will be returning later than expected.

226
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,370
I am sure they will have no objection.

227
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,630
You know our 4th brother?

228
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,860
Do you really think he didn't
get training in martial arts?

229
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:49,150
During the ritual,
he was like this and this, so...

230
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,670
It's his skill from dealing with animals.

231
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,610
Don't let him get a big ego.

232
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:57,880
It wasn't the skill of a person
who practiced by himself.

233
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,920
I'm certain he was taught by someone
and was properly trained.

234
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,720
The Kangs of Shinju trained
their hostage in martial arts?

235
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,790
Why would they?

236
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,550
If any of you hear anything,
let me know.

237
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,030
It sounds amusing.

238
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:18,220
You want us to inquire about our
4th brother learning martial arts?

239
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:22,880
Baek Ah, you know many people.
It would be easy for you to find out.

240
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,030
The only people who visit my home
are musicians and women.

241
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,670
It won't be easy for me.

242
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:35,730
Did you not chase
the assassins last night?

243
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:38,860
I did.

244
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,710
But I went the wrong way,
so I didn't see any of them.

245
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,620
I didn't even see a rat.

246
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:50,010
I heard you went to the same forest.

247
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:53,070
I was hoping you had caught
one of them, at least.

248
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,310
I regret it too.

249
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,290
If I had been there,
would they have slipped away like that?

250
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,040
Your Majesty.

251
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,360
Are you celebrating the new year?
You should enjoy yourselves.

252
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,920
You all suffered last night.

253
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,090
If any of you were injured,
don't wait, and see a doctor.

254
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,610
We will do so. Do not worry.

255
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,390
Eun, why is there a bruise on your face?

256
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,500
This?

257
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,140
Oh, this...

258
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:42,300
There was a fight.

259
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,960
A fight?

260
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,080
A fight that would cause
a prince to hurt his face?

261
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,590
How can the dignity of the
royal family have fallen so low?

262
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,120
Who did it? Tell me at once.

263
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,560
Ah, that is...

264
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,380
Well...

265
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,960
The 10th Prince is coming with
the punishment from the king, right?

266
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,280
Yes, it is usually carried out
by the authorities.

267
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,680
The 10th Prince is insisting
on coming himself.

268
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,010
He just wants to see for himself
what happens to me.

269
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,640
You don't think they're going to
cut my arms and legs off, do you?

270
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,060
I don't know.

271
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,360
The 8th Prince must have
received news of this, right?

272
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,190
He must have...

273
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,560
Nothing will happen. Yes, of course.

274
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,520
Will I be okay?

275
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,720
Prince Eun! Prince Eun!

276
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:46,530
Your Highness! Wait!

277
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,610
Oh dear, were you waiting for me?

278
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:02,160
Do you have the king's punishment for me?

279
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:06,530
The king was in a rage when he saw this
bruise on this great face of mine.

280
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,490
He told me to beat you immediately.

281
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,440
Why should I be beaten?

282
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,670
You did wrong first.

283
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:17,630
Oh! You left out the part about
what you did wrong, didn't you?

284
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,750
Hey now, do you think
I'm such a petty man?

285
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,770
I begged the king for
forgiveness on your behalf

286
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,140
in a way you can't even imagine.

287
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:28,170
If a girl who hit the prince
must be punished

288
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:31,570
what kind of a punishment must
a man who got hit by girl receive?

289
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:35,580
It should be a saying
recorded in history as a wise quote.

290
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,930
What do you think?
You're thankful, right?

291
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:42,480
Well, I don't know why you
were so generous with me.

292
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,510
Yes, I am so thankful I could die.

293
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,270
- Hey!
- What now?

294
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:51,520
I... have something to say to you.

295
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,800
Well, so...

296
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,550
You can go on in now.

297
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,410
You should all go. Get going!

298
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,790
What are you trying to pull now?

299
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,220
I'm not going to pull anything.

300
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,610
I'm not a man who
hold grudges like that.

301
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,990
Then what is it?

302
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,760
It's just...

303
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,430
Well...

304
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,210
So, what I'm saying is...

305
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,050
<i>Has he possibly...</i>

306
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,230
<i>fallen for me?</i>

307
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,990
<i>"You were the first girl
to ever treat me in that way."</i>

308
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,050
<i>Something like this?</i>

309
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,670
I just wanted to say...

310
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:48,700
you were the first girl
to ever treat me in that way.

311
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,110
What the heck?

312
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,000
What did you say?

313
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,620
I didn't know they've been using
that line for over a thousand years.

314
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,380
That line is a great line.

315
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,700
A thousand years?

316
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,240
Anyway, it was my first time fighting
so openly like that since I grew up.

317
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,770
Everyone, including
my mother and grandpa

318
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,680
are afraid of me, and let me hit them.

319
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,870
I've never fought with anyone before.

320
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,560
It was fun.

321
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,370
Yes, then come by often.

322
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,480
I will fight you without holding back.

323
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,540
You want me to come by often to see you?

324
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:24,070
You did stop me from getting punished
and having my limbs cut off.

325
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,730
That's the least I can do.

326
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,130
Today is our first day, then!

327
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:07,120
- There's a fight over there.
- Where?

328
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,710
Hurry up!

329
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,710
There, there!

330
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,360
There must be a fight over there!

331
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,840
Next man, come on up!

332
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,950
Baek Ah! Baek Ah!

333
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,930
Baek Ah, Baek Ah!

334
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,720
Please let it go this once.

335
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,720
Don't even try it.

336
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:40,490
Then sell me that drawing.

337
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,050
Bring me a house, then.

338
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,940
Then... I won't let you
get away with it either.

339
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,300
You're dressed in common clothes
and came out to have fun too.

340
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,600
I am not!

341
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:55,040
The king ordered me to come out
and draw pictures of the people.

342
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,510
You don't know anything. Just you wait.

343
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,700
Baek Ah.

344
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,780
Don't follow me!
I'm going somewhere important.

345
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,550
You're just going to Wook's house!

346
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,780
Hey.

347
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,830
Hey!

348
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:18,090
- Thank you, Brother!
- Stop right there!

349
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,160
I have many memories of our time
together when we were younger.

350
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,980
Those days were like a dream.

351
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:07,410
I resent Wook quite a bit.

352
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,050
<i>[13th Prince Baek Ah]</i>

353
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:13,920
Maybe if he opened up his heart
to you a bit more, Sister.

354
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,390
I told you not to call me Sister anymore.

355
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,060
Your brother will hear you.

356
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,610
Before you were my sister-in-law,
I called you Sister.

357
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:26,390
I knew you before Wook did.
He won't be able to say anything.

358
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,020
He is being good to you
by pretending not to hear.

359
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,560
You should be careful.

360
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,720
I do not want to.

361
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,860
Once a sister, always a sister.

362
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,880
All right.

363
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,830
All right, all right.

364
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:49,560
Isn't that Hae Soo over there?

365
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,900
All right...

366
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,910
All right. All right!

367
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,560
All right.

368
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:01,530
It will not work out well for you.

369
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:04,050
You revealed your own crime!

370
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:11,070
You should not be looking at what
a married couple is doing.

371
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:14,250
I will deal with it harshly.

372
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,570
Do you understand?

373
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:19,110
I do not understand.

374
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,140
I heard she hurt her head.

375
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,960
She seems completely different
from the little I knew of her before.

376
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,260
Even that fight with the 10th Prince.

377
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:28,220
She is the most entertaining girl lately.

378
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:32,550
Her memory has not returned,
but she is warmer than she was before.

379
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,740
- She surprises me often.
- All right.

380
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,830
All right.

381
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:39,050
Though her nursing abilities
have become more awkward.

382
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,150
That child...

383
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,060
she is very much like you, Baek Ah.

384
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,430
Why would you say such a mean thing?

385
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,730
Nothing holds her back.

386
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:57,100
She says things that no one thinks of.

387
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,630
She is very free.

388
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,350
She enjoys fun things.

389
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,510
She hates to lose and gets angry.

390
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,640
I would believe it
if she were your sister.

391
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,960
Baek Ah, your sister is not me, but Soo.

392
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,550
Don't speak that way.

393
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,250
You know what my feelings
for you are, Sister.

394
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:22,250
You know very well.

395
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,540
Myung Hee.

396
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,590
What do you mean they are
all missing their tongues?

397
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:37,180
What would they have
been promised, and by whom

398
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,810
that they would cut out their tongues?

399
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:42,810
Wouldn't a professional assassin group
be willing to do so?

400
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:46,040
Like Gum Gye? Or Chil Sal?

401
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,120
It wouldn't be the Heuk Sal Wol...

402
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,950
I'm the only one thinking here.

403
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:54,830
You have to pitch in
with your thoughts, as well.

404
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,190
It is Daegyuhwan Hell.

405
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:01,110
They cut off the tongues of those
who commit murder or adultery.

406
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,870
This is a setback.

407
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,830
They already had no tongues.

408
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,860
What?

409
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:15,120
What if their tongues weren't cut out,
but they didn't even have tongues?

410
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,340
I heard that there are fallen monks
who use this kind of punishment.

411
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,630
Keep going.

412
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:23,520
<i>Once the fallen monks are punished,
they are excluded from the holy order.</i>

413
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,800
<i>He would use the punished men
with no tongues as the assassins.</i>

414
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,550
<i>The assassins that were disguised as
performers were let into the palace.</i>

415
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,770
Then... who could be behind this?

416
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,250
Someone who has more than any other.

417
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,380
Someone who could meet with the
fallen monks without anyone noticing.

418
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:52,950
Ji Mong, find out who went out into
the city the most often in recent months.

419
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,330
Yes, Crown Prince.

420
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,910
What are you doing?

421
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,330
It was you, wasn't it?

422
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:05,450
You tried to kill Crown Prince Moo.

423
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,810
You crazy bastard.
Don't try to accuse me.

424
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,440
Do you have evidence?

425
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:14,890
You used the assassins from
the monks and killed them all.

426
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:17,350
- Isn't that right?
- That is nonsense.

427
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,750
Let go.

428
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,940
Was it Mother?

429
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,870
What?

430
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,770
I asked you if Mother is behind this!

431
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,900
Don't you dare disgrace our mother!

432
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:03,990
Jung, you'll hurt yourself.

433
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,220
This one too.

434
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,720
This one is old as well.

435
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:37,190
Myung Hee, what is all of that?

436
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,780
The prince is donating
some food and items

437
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,870
to a town hit by freezing weather.

438
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,930
Oh, I see.

439
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,010
Are you not going?

440
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,130
Me? I don't know.

441
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,790
The prince usually goes alone.

442
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:57,200
What? Then you should go with him.

443
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,960
You can help him and go out together.

444
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,120
It will be nice.

445
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,060
I'll do your makeup for you too.

446
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,380
I wonder if it will be okay.

447
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,470
This is for the eyebrows.

448
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,480
Is this powder? It is.

449
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:33,350
I had a dream.

450
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:38,200
I was selling makeup in my dream.

451
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:43,990
I was doing makeup for a lot of people
like customers and friends.

452
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,810
It wasn't boring at all.

453
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:49,750
How should I put it?

454
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,160
It felt like I was someone important.

455
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:59,600
<i>I liked the feeling of someone
becoming special, thanks to me.</i>

456
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:02,580
<i>The feeling that I was needed...</i>

457
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:10,200
<i>It was a delusional thought
that I could make someone happy.</i>

458
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,690
Smell the fragrance.

459
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:15,260
The rose fragrance is nice, isn't it?

460
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:19,000
This is a good product for people who
have trouble choosing the right color.

461
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,240
Hey!

462
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,230
Over here.

463
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,060
<i>But, I helped make my friend pretty...</i>

464
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,350
<i>and she was going out
to meet my boyfriend.</i>

465
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:46,350
<i>I had been completely betrayed.</i>

466
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,950
The two of them lied to me.

467
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:53,370
They took everything I saved,
including my house.

468
00:41:55,670 --> 00:42:00,720
But I was so stupid and I didn't even
get to say what I wanted to them.

469
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,030
You had a nightmare.

470
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,460
You should quickly forget
a bad dream like that.

471
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,620
A nightmare?

472
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,060
You're right.

473
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:20,460
Maybe all of that is the bad dream.

474
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:22,850
Okay.

475
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,350
I'm not used to the makeup here yet,
so I'm still a little awkward at it.

476
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,450
What do you think?
You look beautiful, right?

477
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:37,680
How...

478
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:43,200
How did you make
my complexion so healthy?

479
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,690
You had a talent like this?

480
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:02,490
Thank you.

481
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,500
Come here, kids.

482
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:36,850
Share it with each other.

483
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,880
Thank you.

484
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:41,980
Hey you!

485
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:47,020
Come here.

486
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,000
Come here, come here, come here!

487
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,160
Come here, you.

488
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,890
Is it okay to take your
friend's food or not?

489
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:54,730
Are you going to do it again or not?

490
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:56,230
You're not, right?

491
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,000
Come on. Let's go.

492
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,420
<i>Yes, please prepare that for me.</i>

493
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,520
<i>Yes.</i>

494
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,890
I didn't know that you had
an interest in these medicines.

495
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:30,200
After I arrived here...

496
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:35,620
I mean after I hurt myself,
I'm happy to see something I remember.

497
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,970
Bombycis, mung beans,
buttercups, and galangal root.

498
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,910
When did you learn all of this?

499
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:46,860
I don't even know all of this.

500
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,770
I made soap before.

501
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:51,330
Soap?

502
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:55,580
Oh... it's used for bathing.

503
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,860
It's a bathing aid.

504
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:02,680
These are all ingredients used
to make skincare products.

505
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:07,140
If you use these to wash,
it makes your skin very nice.

506
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:10,010
I should make one for Lady Hae.

507
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,650
This is the medicine for Lady Hae.

508
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:19,310
And this is the medicine
for cuts that you asked for.

509
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:21,630
- Thank you.
- Yes.

510
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,090
- Soo.
- Yes?

511
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,100
Put this on.

512
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,850
A woman should not
have a scar on her body.

513
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,560
Thank you.

514
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,680
I'm only worried the scar will get worse.

515
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:32,610
I can call a doctor
if you don't want me to.

516
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:47,400
Lady Hae, the prince is coming.

517
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:36,820
Mom.

518
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:41,200
You must have cried a lot by now.

519
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:46,310
You don't need to do that.
I'm doing fine.

520
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:53,690
Honestly...

521
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,460
my heart is wavering.

522
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:06,080
I tell myself that I shouldn't...

523
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:13,640
but, I'm being shaken.

524
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:09,630
<i>I have found the assassin's hideout.</i>

525
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,780
Who is the leader here?

526
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:12,610
Come out.

527
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:20,570
Can none of you really speak a word?

528
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:43,910
Who made such a disgusting place?

529
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,270
Who is it?

530
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,730
Are you in charge of this place?

531
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:06,960
These people were burdened by their sins.

532
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,200
They were punished by
having their tongues cut off.

533
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:13,490
I have been tasked with
watching over these men.

534
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:19,060
Then, you're saying all I have to do
is get rid of you.

535
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:22,540
Who, exactly, are you doing this for?

536
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:28,830
Does your mother
know about this, Your Highness?

537
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,100
This is a place where people
should not speak.

538
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,810
A man who talks too much is here.

539
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,800
You have lived off of the queen.

540
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,320
So, die for the queen.

541
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:04,950
Ji Mong, are you sure this is the place?

542
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:06,460
Yes, I am certain.

543
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:08,950
What has happened here?

544
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:12,380
Put this fire out now!
Find any survivors if you can!

545
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:13,660
Yes, Crown Prince!

546
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,120
Daegyuhwan Hell.

547
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,860
Who's there?

548
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:00,620
It is me, Mother.

549
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:05,830
How dare you come in here?

550
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:35,650
