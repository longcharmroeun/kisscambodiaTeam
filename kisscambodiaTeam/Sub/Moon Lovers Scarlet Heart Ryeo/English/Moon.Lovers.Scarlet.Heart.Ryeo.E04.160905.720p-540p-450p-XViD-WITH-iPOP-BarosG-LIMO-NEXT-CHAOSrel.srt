5
00:01:34,008 --> 00:01:35,042
Who's there?

6
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,843
It is me, Mother.

7
00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:44,755
How dare you come in here?

8
00:02:07,565 --> 00:02:09,119
Why are you here?

9
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,490
Do you know what I've done for you?

10
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:18,563
I made sure no one could kill you.

11
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:21,356
I erased all traces of you.

12
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:26,407
What are you saying?

13
00:02:26,407 --> 00:02:28,407
I cannot understand you at all.

14
00:02:28,407 --> 00:02:30,318
I've burned it all down.

15
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:33,494
Nothing will lead back to you, Mother.

16
00:02:37,362 --> 00:02:40,339
You didn't kill them all, did you?

17
00:02:40,339 --> 00:02:42,652
They only lived because of you.

18
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:46,018
They will not hold it against you
that they died for you.

19
00:02:52,431 --> 00:02:54,482
Did you think I'd tell you
that you did a good job?

20
00:02:55,464 --> 00:02:57,875
Did you want me to ask if
you had injured yourself?

21
00:02:58,691 --> 00:03:00,212
You're like an animal.

22
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:02,102
Leave!

23
00:03:02,102 --> 00:03:04,269
You stink of blood and I cannot sleep.

24
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,477
- It was for you, Mother--
- Mother, Mother, Mother!

25
00:03:11,477 --> 00:03:15,408
Hearing you call me "Mother"
makes my skin crawl.

26
00:03:16,056 --> 00:03:18,978
I do not wish to see you, so go! Go now!

27
00:03:27,995 --> 00:03:29,600
I have always been curious.

28
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,339
Why doesn't Mother feel pity for me?

29
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,139
If you were my mother,
you would care if I were injured.

30
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:43,729
So, why doesn't my mother
ever look back at me?

31
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,359
I waited so desperately for it.

32
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:49,718
- Not once--
- You are not my son.

33
00:03:51,151 --> 00:03:54,771
You are the son of the Kangs in Shinju.

34
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:19,055
It is my face, isn't it?

35
00:04:23,661 --> 00:04:25,916
You sent me to be adopted
instead of my older brother.

36
00:04:27,453 --> 00:04:29,804
And you continue to turn your back on me.

37
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,026
It's all because of this face!

38
00:04:56,621 --> 00:05:00,650
Do you know how my life was
with the Kangs?

39
00:05:03,624 --> 00:05:09,155
Once, they threw me into
the biggest wolves den in Shinju.

40
00:05:10,814 --> 00:05:14,342
I spent all night fighting the animals
with their gnashing teeth.

41
00:05:16,364 --> 00:05:18,374
Then I burned down the entire mountain.

42
00:05:20,605 --> 00:05:24,090
I burned and killed all of them in there.

43
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:30,626
And I lived.

44
00:05:32,696 --> 00:05:37,099
The revolting stench of burning flesh
was still on my body.

45
00:05:48,626 --> 00:05:50,614
The crazy Concubine Kang...

46
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:56,152
She wouldn't let me out of her sight,
thinking I was her dead son.

47
00:05:56,835 --> 00:06:01,919
Then she'd come to her senses,
beat me, and lock me up.

48
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:06,638
She'd demand to know where her son was.

49
00:06:07,924 --> 00:06:10,376
Asking why there was
an unsightly monster...

50
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:17,273
It could be three days, or four.

51
00:06:18,015 --> 00:06:21,600
I didn't get one sip of water,
but no one came to check on me.

52
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,015
What about it?

53
00:06:32,897 --> 00:06:37,061
A mother only recognizes a son
who will make her shine.

54
00:06:39,705 --> 00:06:42,933
You are my shame, disgrace, and flaw.

55
00:06:45,845 --> 00:06:47,684
That's why I sent you away.

56
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:52,809
Thanks to you,
I felt a sense of love and justice.

57
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:54,792
I will thank you for that.

58
00:07:25,234 --> 00:07:27,835
Today is a day you will remember.

59
00:07:30,061 --> 00:07:32,100
You threw me away, Mother.

60
00:07:33,991 --> 00:07:35,761
However, I will not leave.

61
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,864
From now on...

62
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,794
you will have to look only at me.

63
00:07:50,284 --> 00:07:51,592
Nonsense!

64
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:56,414
If you do something like this again,
you'll never step foot in Songak again!

65
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,071
That impudent boy.

66
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:37,217
- Stop, stop!
- All of it, be gone!

67
00:08:39,556 --> 00:08:42,183
Please stop! Stop!

68
00:08:42,183 --> 00:08:43,698
Move!

69
00:08:47,546 --> 00:08:48,785
B... blood.

70
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:54,266
Yes, it's blood.

71
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:57,056
It's the blood of those I killed today.

72
00:08:58,558 --> 00:09:00,719
Mothers build this for their children?

73
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:06,640
She shouldn't come to this thing.
She should come beg to me!

74
00:09:11,441 --> 00:09:14,001
Let go! Let me go!

75
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:15,246
Stop it now.

76
00:09:15,246 --> 00:09:18,080
Do you want to die too? Let me go.

77
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,590
You're injured!

78
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:26,361
Do you have any other injuries?

79
00:09:31,296 --> 00:09:33,816
I told you that I killed people.

80
00:09:38,148 --> 00:09:40,586
Then, tell me why you killed them.

81
00:09:44,254 --> 00:09:47,974
Did you... do it for fun?

82
00:09:52,556 --> 00:09:53,686
Go.

83
00:10:01,418 --> 00:10:02,476
Go!

84
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,408
This is that kind of a place, isn't it?

85
00:10:10,088 --> 00:10:14,432
You have to wield a sword
at a very young age.

86
00:10:15,707 --> 00:10:19,480
You have to kill others
if you want to live.

87
00:10:23,152 --> 00:10:24,999
What can you do?

88
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:30,300
It's not a crime to want to live.

89
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:35,499
You probably won't be forgiven.

90
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:39,206
Still, I understand you.

91
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,398
How you're feeling right now...

92
00:10:43,856 --> 00:10:45,848
it must be so miserable.

93
00:10:47,836 --> 00:10:49,718
I think I can relate.

94
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:36,942
We chased the assassins the night of
the ritual and we found no leads.

95
00:11:36,942 --> 00:11:40,485
The person who hired them
killed them to keep them quiet.

96
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:42,754
We found the temple that
seems to be their headquarters.

97
00:11:42,754 --> 00:11:45,618
They had already been killed
and the temple was burning.

98
00:11:45,618 --> 00:11:46,805
However...

99
00:11:48,883 --> 00:11:50,764
the owner of that temple is...

100
00:11:53,912 --> 00:11:58,695
That temple belongs to Queen Yoo.

101
00:12:07,574 --> 00:12:10,132
Are you saying that
I'm behind the assassination?

102
00:12:10,132 --> 00:12:12,293
That I tried to kill the Crown Prince?

103
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:15,436
Anyone would assume so.

104
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,124
Queen Yoo.

105
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:22,748
Did you plot an assassination
to kill the Crown Prince?

106
00:12:23,686 --> 00:12:25,303
And bring in assassins?

107
00:12:26,422 --> 00:12:27,994
I did no such thing.

108
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:34,050
Your Majesty, it is all my fault.

109
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,768
I never knew it was such a temple.

110
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:38,327
I was the benefactor of the temple
in place of Mother.

111
00:12:38,327 --> 00:12:40,393
Take my life, Your Majesty.

112
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:44,556
It is all my fault.

113
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:47,465
If a child has done wrong,
then so has the mother.

114
00:12:48,471 --> 00:12:49,830
I did it.

115
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,731
The killing and the fire in the temple...

116
00:12:56,182 --> 00:12:57,340
I did it.

117
00:13:00,903 --> 00:13:03,512
Are you saying you tried to
kill the Crown Prince?

118
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,171
Your Majesty, the assassins live in
a temple that the queen owns.

119
00:13:10,171 --> 00:13:12,681
They impersonated princes and
killed the assassins that night.

120
00:13:12,681 --> 00:13:16,713
This is most definitely a trick to get
the royal family to turn on each other.

121
00:13:20,043 --> 00:13:24,633
Just as Wook said,
I was afraid that Mother would be framed.

122
00:13:26,662 --> 00:13:28,923
Forgive me for my poor decision.

123
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,308
You haven't done it. You do it.

124
00:13:34,308 --> 00:13:35,696
It's your turn.

125
00:13:35,696 --> 00:13:37,235
- I don't want to.
- You do it.

126
00:13:37,235 --> 00:13:39,268
- You do it.
- No, I really don't want to.

127
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:40,676
Chae Ryung.

128
00:13:41,735 --> 00:13:43,747
- Lady Hae.
- What is it?

129
00:13:43,747 --> 00:13:45,846
There are guests. You should be careful.

130
00:13:45,846 --> 00:13:49,865
Everyone is trying to avoid
taking a meal up to the 4th Prince.

131
00:13:49,865 --> 00:13:52,255
How can you take the
prince's meal so lightly?

132
00:13:54,056 --> 00:13:55,417
Enough now.

133
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,792
Someone take up the 4th Prince's meal.

134
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:00,738
I do not want to see this again.

135
00:14:13,781 --> 00:14:14,800
Me?

136
00:14:17,218 --> 00:14:20,283
Look at you all. I'm a lady.

137
00:14:20,283 --> 00:14:23,199
I shouldn't be delivering meals, right?

138
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,238
Huh?

139
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:44,738
Why? Why doesn't he eat in his room?
Why make all this trouble?

140
00:14:45,657 --> 00:14:48,800
I knew I didn't like him.
He's going all out.

141
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,233
Gosh, I'm tired.

142
00:14:53,412 --> 00:14:54,593
Oh my.

143
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,896
Yesterday, he made such a commotion.

144
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:02,220
He sure looks innocent from the back.

145
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,959
He actually looks lonely.

146
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:22,264
Your meal has arrived.

147
00:15:24,825 --> 00:15:26,211
Leave it there.

148
00:15:28,223 --> 00:15:30,332
You'd like to eat alone in peace?

149
00:15:30,995 --> 00:15:32,682
You do that.

150
00:16:00,181 --> 00:16:02,287
I have to take back the empty bowls.

151
00:16:02,969 --> 00:16:04,797
Why don't you eat quickly?

152
00:16:08,308 --> 00:16:11,832
About yesterday, you didn't see anything.

153
00:16:13,385 --> 00:16:14,745
Be careful what you say.

154
00:16:15,736 --> 00:16:17,986
I wouldn't talk about that
even if I could.

155
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:20,162
I can't believe it,
even though I saw it myself.

156
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:23,552
I have my own issues.

157
00:16:23,552 --> 00:16:26,173
I don't have time to go around
talking about other people.

158
00:16:27,124 --> 00:16:29,399
Every time I see you,
you tell me to forget I saw you.

159
00:16:32,153 --> 00:16:36,055
By the way, is it better
if you eat out here?

160
00:16:37,721 --> 00:16:41,686
Oh, are you looking at
the palace over there?

161
00:16:43,223 --> 00:16:45,341
That will eventually be your home.

162
00:16:45,341 --> 00:16:48,672
Why must you stare at it while eating?

163
00:16:52,322 --> 00:16:56,204
If it is home, I should have a family.

164
00:16:56,793 --> 00:16:57,825
Huh?

165
00:16:58,555 --> 00:17:01,407
I heard that your mother, father,
and brother all live there.

166
00:17:04,532 --> 00:17:08,095
Now that it's come up...

167
00:17:08,796 --> 00:17:10,383
why did you do that yesterday?

168
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:15,417
You! How did you get into
the palace bath that day?

169
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:18,075
Oh, oh, oh, I...

170
00:17:18,075 --> 00:17:20,966
Chae Ryung says that
the chicken is the best.

171
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,301
Is the doctor not here yet?

172
00:18:31,965 --> 00:18:34,355
Be strong, Myung Hee. Okay?

173
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:37,699
Soo, step outside for a moment.

174
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,003
What?

175
00:18:40,048 --> 00:18:42,244
What is it, Lady? What is it?

176
00:18:43,404 --> 00:18:44,513
Go on.

177
00:18:57,857 --> 00:19:00,169
Take a second wife.

178
00:19:05,421 --> 00:19:06,786
Wife.

179
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:13,176
I am a very weak person.

180
00:19:14,715 --> 00:19:17,429
Whether it is running this household
or giving you an heir

181
00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:21,559
I have not done anything
as your wife, Prince Wook.

182
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:22,857
Therefore...

183
00:19:25,147 --> 00:19:26,225
Your Highness.

184
00:19:28,446 --> 00:19:30,693
Marry someone else.

185
00:19:34,103 --> 00:19:37,833
Or divorce me before that.

186
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:41,943
I must absolve myself of
the wrong I've done to you.

187
00:19:43,273 --> 00:19:47,098
That way, I can die and rest in peace.

188
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,494
I do not want to.

189
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,629
You must do so.

190
00:20:01,274 --> 00:20:03,369
Also, I know.

191
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,549
Your Highness, you do not...

192
00:20:18,212 --> 00:20:20,414
You do not love me.

193
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,134
Stop that!

194
00:20:57,792 --> 00:20:59,714
What are you so worried about?

195
00:21:01,973 --> 00:21:05,801
Whatever your worries are,
you'll forget them once you play.

196
00:21:08,371 --> 00:21:10,432
Here! I have a gift for you.

197
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,632
I didn't know what you liked

198
00:21:16,632 --> 00:21:18,801
so I brought everything
that caught my eye.

199
00:21:19,921 --> 00:21:21,042
A top.

200
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,253
Cards.

201
00:21:25,703 --> 00:21:30,292
This is something I really like.
It's a slingshot that never misses.

202
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:32,131
You can have this too.

203
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:36,041
You've never seen this, have you?

204
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:38,130
It's a silk ball from the Qing Dynasty.

205
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,842
They say girls like it.

206
00:21:43,872 --> 00:21:46,471
How old are you
that you play with these things?

207
00:21:49,322 --> 00:21:51,966
Then, what do you like?

208
00:21:51,966 --> 00:21:55,980
Gosh... I'm already so frustrated.

209
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,831
Take all of this and
go play over there, okay?

210
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:04,235
You need to share your burdens
in order to lighten them.

211
00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:07,302
Is it something I can't help with?

212
00:22:08,892 --> 00:22:11,138
I am a prince.

213
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:16,455
Are you married?

214
00:22:22,094 --> 00:22:23,389
Not yet.

215
00:22:23,389 --> 00:22:25,362
How many are you going to have?

216
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:29,738
I haven't thought about that yet.

217
00:22:31,109 --> 00:22:35,569
If your wife became sick and ill,
would you bring in another woman?

218
00:22:35,569 --> 00:22:36,761
No way!

219
00:22:36,761 --> 00:22:39,862
I don't want to deal with the stress
of having many wives like my father.

220
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:44,488
I'm going to find someone perfect
and be with her for 100 years.

221
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:49,997
It would be nice if everyone
were like you, Prince Eun.

222
00:22:51,197 --> 00:22:53,177
You're unexpectedly pure.

223
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:04,100
She's moving quite fast on her own.

224
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,384
It's a bit fast for me.

225
00:23:11,253 --> 00:23:13,563
<i>Put this in the 4th Prince's room
without anyone knowing.</i>

226
00:23:13,563 --> 00:23:16,963
Don't put it in an obvious spot.
Put it where he has to search for it.

227
00:23:26,704 --> 00:23:27,851
<i>I don't want to.</i>

228
00:23:27,851 --> 00:23:32,195
If I run into the prince,
I'm dead right on the spot.

229
00:23:32,195 --> 00:23:35,376
It's his to begin with.
He won't say anything if you get caught.

230
00:23:41,939 --> 00:23:45,216
- Clean up while the prince is out.
- Yes.

231
00:23:46,532 --> 00:23:48,369
What are you doing in here?

232
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:55,048
- Are you...
- No!

233
00:23:55,048 --> 00:23:57,399
I wasn't stealing anything.

234
00:24:15,645 --> 00:24:18,115
Tell me. What else were you stealing?

235
00:24:18,115 --> 00:24:22,784
I was not... stealing.

236
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:26,703
Then, were you giving
the prince a present?

237
00:24:29,362 --> 00:24:30,442
Whip her.

238
00:24:34,362 --> 00:24:35,591
Wait!

239
00:24:43,714 --> 00:24:45,642
What did she do so wrong
for you to do this?

240
00:24:45,642 --> 00:24:48,253
She stole something important
from the 4th Prince.

241
00:24:50,665 --> 00:24:52,388
The hairpin?

242
00:24:52,388 --> 00:24:55,463
I told her to put it there.
She didn't steal it.

243
00:24:55,463 --> 00:24:57,753
It isn't something you would
be able to own.

244
00:24:57,753 --> 00:24:59,071
It doesn't make sense.

245
00:24:59,071 --> 00:25:00,913
That's because it belongs to the prince.

246
00:25:00,913 --> 00:25:02,773
That's why I'm saying it was stolen.

247
00:25:02,773 --> 00:25:04,293
Whip her again.

248
00:25:09,821 --> 00:25:12,684
Then, hit me instead.

249
00:25:14,293 --> 00:25:17,435
I can't give you the details,
but Chae Ryung is innocent.

250
00:25:17,435 --> 00:25:20,639
If you must whip someone,
I told her to do it, so whip me instead.

251
00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:21,840
Lady!

252
00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:25,699
- Tie her up.
- Yes.

253
00:25:30,944 --> 00:25:32,161
Lady!

254
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:34,488
Lady...

255
00:25:35,588 --> 00:25:37,319
Wook, you have to stop her.

256
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:38,985
She'll really end up getting hit.

257
00:25:38,985 --> 00:25:42,384
Why should he stop her?
The servants need to be taught a lesson.

258
00:25:42,384 --> 00:25:45,745
I think that servant
has been beaten enough.

259
00:25:46,804 --> 00:25:49,426
Yeon Hwa's beatings can be quite severe.

260
00:25:50,323 --> 00:25:51,751
Yeon Hwa...

261
00:25:57,671 --> 00:25:59,042
Yeon Hwa!

262
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:06,128
Let go.

263
00:26:06,128 --> 00:26:07,541
That's enough, now.

264
00:26:07,541 --> 00:26:09,763
I'm in charge of running the household.

265
00:26:09,763 --> 00:26:10,974
Let me go.

266
00:26:15,132 --> 00:26:16,621
She belongs to me.

267
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,511
What did you just say?

268
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,261
I said that she belongs to me.

269
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:51,696
That hairpin is mine.

270
00:26:51,696 --> 00:26:55,821
I should be the one who
decides what to do with her.

271
00:26:55,821 --> 00:26:57,223
So!

272
00:26:57,223 --> 00:26:58,781
Soo did not steal it!

273
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,790
She told me she picked it up
in front of So's room.

274
00:27:02,753 --> 00:27:06,719
No... I saw her pick it up.

275
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:10,122
- Eun, even you?
- Untie Lady Hae Soo.

276
00:27:11,221 --> 00:27:12,361
Now!

277
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,647
You were too quick
to act this time, Yeon Hwa.

278
00:27:59,666 --> 00:28:02,121
Yeon Hwa, you did the right thing.

279
00:28:02,951 --> 00:28:05,058
People like that need to be
put in their place.

280
00:28:06,122 --> 00:28:07,417
The mood here is terrible.

281
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,599
I should get going.

282
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:10,977
I'll be going, as well.

283
00:28:13,855 --> 00:28:14,908
Let's go, Eun.

284
00:28:14,908 --> 00:28:17,076
She should put ointment on her wounds.

285
00:28:17,076 --> 00:28:19,250
- Soo!
- Come on now!

286
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,688
Let go of me! I told you to let go.

287
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,826
Did you feel that sorry for her?

288
00:28:45,814 --> 00:28:49,475
The brother I know is not someone
who would stop me like this.

289
00:28:51,984 --> 00:28:56,417
You don't have feelings for her, do you?

290
00:28:59,182 --> 00:29:00,521
Yeon Hwa.

291
00:29:01,524 --> 00:29:04,175
I am sorry if I have disrespected you.

292
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,086
You said she belongs to you.

293
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:45,541
I came to let you know,
because you seem to be mistaken.

294
00:29:46,765 --> 00:29:50,639
Nothing here belongs to you.

295
00:29:54,046 --> 00:29:56,942
Not Yeon Hwa. Not Hae Soo.

296
00:29:57,827 --> 00:29:59,057
They are all my people.

297
00:30:02,004 --> 00:30:06,276
When it comes to my sister
or my wife's cousin...

298
00:30:07,984 --> 00:30:09,820
do not behave carelessly again.

299
00:30:34,738 --> 00:30:35,881
<i>Soo.</i>

300
00:30:41,692 --> 00:30:45,025
<i>If you happen to be awake,
I have left medicine here for you.</i>

301
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:47,245
<i>Don't forget to use it.</i>

302
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:58,653
<i>Also...</i>

303
00:31:01,336 --> 00:31:04,877
<i>I hope you can forget everything
that happened earlier today.</i>

304
00:32:14,834 --> 00:32:16,144
I'm sorry.

305
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:20,373
I was embarrassed to see you.

306
00:32:21,503 --> 00:32:22,723
I pretended to sleep.

307
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,141
I know you did.

308
00:32:32,654 --> 00:32:36,482
You're still in a lot of pain,
aren't you?

309
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:40,061
It's not because I was whipped.

310
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,951
I'm more upset that I was
treated in that way.

311
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,099
This place...

312
00:32:51,051 --> 00:32:53,223
is it always this way?

313
00:32:54,521 --> 00:32:58,271
Is it a place that disrespects you unless
you're somebody's daughter or son?

314
00:33:00,881 --> 00:33:06,820
A person can tie up another
like an animal and hit them.

315
00:33:10,142 --> 00:33:11,359
Goryeo...

316
00:33:13,704 --> 00:33:15,744
is it like this?

317
00:33:28,603 --> 00:33:30,534
I'm sorry I could not stop it.

318
00:33:32,568 --> 00:33:37,011
However, I promise you this.

319
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:43,448
No one will ever be able to
treat you in such a manner again.

320
00:33:46,318 --> 00:33:47,487
Trust me.

321
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,108
<i>Here I go again.</i>

322
00:33:53,108 --> 00:33:54,879
<i>Think of Lady Hae.</i>

323
00:33:54,879 --> 00:33:58,039
<i>If you let him come closer,
you are hurting Lady Hae.</i>

324
00:34:30,328 --> 00:34:31,333
Oh my!

325
00:34:32,194 --> 00:34:35,723
Ouch! Oh!

326
00:34:35,723 --> 00:34:37,293
You bumped into me.

327
00:34:38,982 --> 00:34:40,660
"She belongs to me"?

328
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:43,072
Why would you say that
and create misunderstanding?

329
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:45,197
Don't you know how to say thank you?

330
00:34:45,197 --> 00:34:47,343
I saved you from a beating.

331
00:34:47,855 --> 00:34:51,722
Before you argue about that,
you should thank me for saving you.

332
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:53,823
You were always acting like
you wanted to kill me.

333
00:34:53,823 --> 00:34:56,653
I am curious about why the winds changed.

334
00:34:58,992 --> 00:35:00,132
Thank you.

335
00:35:05,411 --> 00:35:07,560
Why did you even have that hairpin?

336
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,770
Where did you get it?

337
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:11,328
You dropped it at the bath in the palace.

338
00:35:11,328 --> 00:35:14,103
This is all because I was keeping
quiet about seeing your face...

339
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,837
So, I didn't say I saw your face.

340
00:35:16,837 --> 00:35:18,630
I kept my promise.

341
00:35:21,592 --> 00:35:23,400
Aren't you even scared of me?

342
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,065
You talk back to me every single time.

343
00:35:27,257 --> 00:35:29,438
You don't seem like a person
I should take lightly.

344
00:35:30,447 --> 00:35:32,328
But I'm not scared of you anymore.

345
00:35:34,319 --> 00:35:38,686
However, do not say I
"belong" to you ever again.

346
00:35:39,927 --> 00:35:40,935
Why not?

347
00:35:40,935 --> 00:35:43,199
I'm a person, not an item or an animal.

348
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:45,154
How can you say I belong to you
or anyone else?

349
00:35:49,317 --> 00:35:50,685
Then...

350
00:35:56,038 --> 00:35:57,697
Should I call you my "person"?

351
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:02,969
That's not it either.

352
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:06,005
Let's refrain from these
burdensome titles.

353
00:36:06,806 --> 00:36:08,326
Think of something else.

354
00:36:41,179 --> 00:36:44,906
Look, isn't it the 14th Prince?

355
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,636
Let go of me!

356
00:36:53,257 --> 00:36:54,822
- Oh.
- Let me go.

357
00:36:57,177 --> 00:36:58,864
I told you to let me go!

358
00:36:58,864 --> 00:36:59,940
Oh no.

359
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,605
Isn't that the 14th Prince?

360
00:37:01,605 --> 00:37:02,909
It is.

361
00:37:03,467 --> 00:37:04,576
Hey!

362
00:37:06,348 --> 00:37:08,446
You should go get someone.

363
00:37:08,446 --> 00:37:10,833
- What about you?
- The two of us aren't enough.

364
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:13,114
I have to follow them,
so you go get help.

365
00:37:13,114 --> 00:37:15,188
Hurry, hurry! Go now!

366
00:37:27,795 --> 00:37:30,190
Let me go! Let go!

367
00:37:33,822 --> 00:37:35,545
You don't know who you're dealing with.

368
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:37,996
Don't you care about your lives?

369
00:37:37,996 --> 00:37:41,926
Prince Jung, you're the one
who made my arm this way.

370
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,328
- You went too far.
- I've never done such a thing.

371
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:45,417
That's true.

372
00:37:45,417 --> 00:37:47,656
You only lost to me in a fight.

373
00:37:47,956 --> 00:37:51,000
It was your mother who did this to me.

374
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,851
I knew nothing about that.

375
00:37:53,851 --> 00:37:54,882
Therefore...

376
00:38:03,368 --> 00:38:05,837
Let go of me. I told you to let go!

377
00:38:05,837 --> 00:38:07,647
Is anyone there?

378
00:38:09,112 --> 00:38:10,346
Oh no...

379
00:38:13,023 --> 00:38:14,147
All right.

380
00:38:15,069 --> 00:38:17,619
Accept it. Do it!

381
00:38:17,619 --> 00:38:20,109
Hey!

382
00:38:20,109 --> 00:38:22,610
Move it! Out of the way, you punks!

383
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:25,850
Get back, get back!

384
00:38:27,219 --> 00:38:30,397
I'll pull out your intestines
and make stew with them.

385
00:38:30,397 --> 00:38:33,652
What do you think you're looking at?
You're dead if you come any closer!

386
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,069
You're dead if you come closer!
Don't look at me, you punk!

387
00:38:37,384 --> 00:38:42,127
Get the hell away from us, you bastards!

388
00:38:43,895 --> 00:38:48,536
My daughter-in-law looks sicker
every time I see her.

389
00:38:49,366 --> 00:38:52,177
She has suggested divorce to Wook.

390
00:38:52,686 --> 00:38:55,047
- We should be thankful.
- What?

391
00:38:55,848 --> 00:38:57,130
Is that true?

392
00:38:58,261 --> 00:39:00,393
I will not turn my back on my wife.

393
00:39:01,212 --> 00:39:04,261
I want you to pretend
you did not hear about it.

394
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:07,938
You need to consider marrying again
for the sake of your future.

395
00:39:10,589 --> 00:39:12,877
Are you suggesting I marry for
obvious, political reasons

396
00:39:12,877 --> 00:39:14,020
like our third brother did?

397
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,208
I will lose favor with the king.

398
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:17,527
There are many ways to avoid suspicion.

Yeon Hwa!

400
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:25,203
It's because of the Hae household that
we can walk on Songak ground again.

401
00:39:25,203 --> 00:39:29,159
I think it's only right that we
do not forget to repay that debt.

402
00:39:30,188 --> 00:39:32,016
- She is ill.
- Mother!

403
00:39:32,016 --> 00:39:34,188
<i>Prince Wook! Prince Wook!</i>

404
00:39:34,188 --> 00:39:36,228
- Prince...
- You.

405
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:41,161
Prince, something has
happened to Lady Soo.

406
00:39:41,647 --> 00:39:44,194
You must go now!

407
00:39:46,697 --> 00:39:47,985
Oh!

408
00:39:50,056 --> 00:39:51,344
You're okay, right?

409
00:39:51,344 --> 00:39:53,127
I'm sorry you had to get involved.

410
00:39:53,127 --> 00:39:55,342
For now... let's run.

411
00:39:55,342 --> 00:39:56,522
Run? What?

412
00:39:56,522 --> 00:39:58,114
Let's just run for it.

413
00:39:58,114 --> 00:40:00,683
I can't go like this.
I'm going to just--

414
00:40:00,683 --> 00:40:02,592
Are you insane? Let's go.

415
00:40:03,282 --> 00:40:05,721
Oh my goodness. Oh my!

416
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,549
What do I do?

417
00:40:12,471 --> 00:40:13,953
Prince Jung!

418
00:40:17,156 --> 00:40:20,384
Don't worry. I promise I'll save you.

419
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:22,433
Who's saving whom?

420
00:40:23,572 --> 00:40:24,942
Stop!

421
00:40:31,576 --> 00:40:32,978
Wook.

422
00:40:44,632 --> 00:40:45,810
Wook.

423
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:48,388
Are you hurt?

424
00:40:48,388 --> 00:40:49,900
I can endure it.

425
00:40:51,346 --> 00:40:52,377
And you?

426
00:40:54,487 --> 00:40:55,690
Get him!

427
00:41:35,157 --> 00:41:38,110
Overconfidence is your greatest enemy.
Do you not know that saying?

428
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:50,159
That is true.

429
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:54,947
Wolf... wolf...

430
00:41:54,947 --> 00:41:56,786
Overconfidence is your greatest enemy.

431
00:41:56,786 --> 00:41:59,634
It's the wolf dog.
What do we do? The wolf dog.

432
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:02,346
Shouldn't we run away?

433
00:42:04,036 --> 00:42:06,545
You're not running even after seeing me?

434
00:42:08,096 --> 00:42:10,069
Are you all brave?

435
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,295
Or...

436
00:42:15,123 --> 00:42:17,293
do you all want to die?

437
00:42:19,326 --> 00:42:20,576
Run.

438
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:51,859
Are you hurt?

439
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:54,306
I'm not hurt.

440
00:42:55,237 --> 00:42:56,962
It's a relief that So came.

441
00:43:00,507 --> 00:43:02,679
I won't forget what you did for me, Wook.

442
00:43:03,138 --> 00:43:07,134
You saved my arm,
so I'll remember that.

443
00:43:07,134 --> 00:43:10,060
Your life will be like my own life.

444
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,480
Even if I have to die,
I will save your life.

445
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,837
Oh... oh dear.

446
00:43:15,837 --> 00:43:18,078
Oh, our youngest prince.

447
00:43:18,078 --> 00:43:21,638
You're already so reliable and strong.
You'll be a great man soon.

448
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:26,054
Oh!

449
00:43:26,786 --> 00:43:28,123
I'm sorry.

450
00:43:30,243 --> 00:43:33,243
You reminded me of a little brother
I have back home.

451
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:35,161
It's okay.

452
00:43:35,161 --> 00:43:37,605
Hae Soo... sister.

453
00:43:38,902 --> 00:43:40,063
Sister?

454
00:43:42,922 --> 00:43:45,922
Please watch over me to see
what kind of man I become.

455
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:50,359
Of course. Prince Jung, go get it!

456
00:43:52,241 --> 00:43:54,967
Go... get...

457
00:43:54,967 --> 00:43:55,996
It!

458
00:43:57,023 --> 00:43:58,851
Go get it!

459
00:43:59,592 --> 00:44:00,782
Go get it.

460
00:44:03,603 --> 00:44:05,067
Go get it.

461
00:44:07,565 --> 00:44:08,837
Wait for me.

462
00:44:10,768 --> 00:44:14,177
Slow down a bit!

463
00:44:17,757 --> 00:44:19,217
Are you angry?

464
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:21,380
Why?

465
00:44:27,777 --> 00:44:30,286
Oh... oh my.

466
00:44:32,572 --> 00:44:35,252
My leg hurts so much that I can't walk.

467
00:44:40,391 --> 00:44:44,813
Oh, I was running to
get away from those men.

468
00:44:44,813 --> 00:44:47,114
I didn't even know
that I had hurt my leg.

469
00:44:48,708 --> 00:44:50,435
How much did I injure myself?

470
00:44:50,735 --> 00:44:52,496
I don't think I can take another step.

471
00:45:02,052 --> 00:45:03,808
I thought I had lost you.

472
00:45:05,509 --> 00:45:06,578
What?

473
00:45:08,585 --> 00:45:13,060
I... thought I wouldn't be able
to see you again.

474
00:45:16,509 --> 00:45:18,344
I was scared.

475
00:45:39,232 --> 00:45:42,766
- Lady Soo!
- Prince Wook!

476
00:45:42,766 --> 00:45:44,127
Over there!

477
00:45:44,127 --> 00:45:45,449
Lady!

478
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:53,290
Lady, are you okay?

479
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:54,878
What about the 14th Prince?

480
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:56,302
He's okay too.

481
00:45:56,915 --> 00:45:58,042
Soo!

482
00:45:58,681 --> 00:46:02,081
Myung Hee, I made you worry. I'm sorry.

483
00:46:05,065 --> 00:46:07,228
We sent out the men.

484
00:46:07,228 --> 00:46:09,554
You and the prince were gone,
so we worried.

485
00:46:09,554 --> 00:46:12,089
Mother was worried.

486
00:46:12,089 --> 00:46:13,813
Go to the palace tomorrow...

487
00:46:16,956 --> 00:46:18,297
Wook!

488
00:46:42,201 --> 00:46:44,143
You even disguise yourself and go out?

489
00:46:45,313 --> 00:46:47,422
I came here in case Mother finds out.

490
00:46:47,422 --> 00:46:50,922
Thank you for your discretion
and consideration.

491
00:46:52,502 --> 00:46:56,402
This kind of outing must be common
if you know people like that.

492
00:46:56,402 --> 00:46:59,922
I just happened to be unlucky.

493
00:46:59,922 --> 00:47:01,192
You were unlucky?

494
00:47:02,123 --> 00:47:05,013
Because of you, a man lost an arm
and his household was ruined.

495
00:47:05,013 --> 00:47:06,362
Unlucky?

496
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,014
How will you take care of it?

497
00:47:10,014 --> 00:47:13,127
I told you that I didn't know!
I didn't do it.

498
00:47:14,964 --> 00:47:17,936
If you didn't know about it,
do you hold no responsibility?

499
00:47:18,708 --> 00:47:20,027
You're a prince.

500
00:47:20,027 --> 00:47:22,900
Don't you know you hold more
responsibility the higher up you are?

501
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,511
That's very funny.

502
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:27,453
Since when were you ever in
such a high position?

503
00:47:28,172 --> 00:47:29,770
Ah...

504
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:32,819
Are you acting like this because you're
the only one Mother treats coldly?

505
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:36,641
Or are you pushing down a
younger brother who might show off?

506
00:47:37,299 --> 00:47:39,509
Yo is right about you.

507
00:47:40,654 --> 00:47:46,333
It's embarrassing to have been
born from the same womb as you.

508
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,125
Stupid kid.

509
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:51,589
- So.
- You...

510
00:47:52,292 --> 00:47:54,819
- Move!
- Mother!

511
00:47:57,491 --> 00:47:59,373
Don't go near him.

512
00:47:59,373 --> 00:48:01,112
Jung, you'll be in danger.

513
00:48:01,112 --> 00:48:04,244
Mother, it was So who saved me.

514
00:48:04,244 --> 00:48:06,891
- I would've lost my arm if not for him.
- Don't be fooled.

515
00:48:07,569 --> 00:48:10,889
He brings misfortune to anyone near him.

516
00:48:12,101 --> 00:48:15,335
I went through it too.
You can't suffer it as well.

517
00:48:15,335 --> 00:48:17,138
Do not go near him.

518
00:48:17,138 --> 00:48:19,779
Still, it was So who saved me.

519
00:48:20,232 --> 00:48:21,576
I want you to say it.

520
00:48:22,415 --> 00:48:25,306
Say you won't go near Jung. Say it now!

521
00:48:27,578 --> 00:48:30,623
If that's what you want,
that's what I'll do.

522
00:48:33,784 --> 00:48:36,163
How long are you going to live
being protected by her?

523
00:48:39,005 --> 00:48:41,502
Jung, let me take a look.
Where were you hurt?

524
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:44,451
Jung, Jung.

525
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,090
What are these wounds?

526
00:48:49,339 --> 00:48:50,730
Jung!

527
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:54,159
My heart feels ripped apart
when you get hurt.

528
00:48:55,721 --> 00:48:58,924
What are you all doing?
Get a doctor now!

529
00:50:44,145 --> 00:50:45,987
- Move!
- Mother!

530
00:50:46,449 --> 00:50:48,103
Don't go near him.

531
00:50:48,103 --> 00:50:49,844
Jung, you'll be in danger.

532
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:05,384
You want the 4th Prince
to live in Songak?

533
00:51:09,824 --> 00:51:12,083
Is it repayment for the fact
that he saved you?

534
00:51:13,663 --> 00:51:17,373
I wish to keep him by my side
as one of my people.

535
00:51:18,732 --> 00:51:19,993
Your Majesty.

536
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:22,907
I saw the 4th Prince's star
rising above Songak.

537
00:51:22,907 --> 00:51:24,797
This must have been the reason for it.

538
00:51:24,797 --> 00:51:27,750
The 4th Prince's star combines with
the Crown Prince's Ursa Major...

539
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,973
Your mother tried to
kill the Crown Prince.

540
00:51:32,683 --> 00:51:36,098
Your older brother desires
to be the Crown Prince.

541
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:42,346
I have never shared their goals.

542
00:51:44,772 --> 00:51:49,953
Then, what will you do about the
reason you were first adopted?

543
00:51:51,623 --> 00:51:55,931
You were sent there to console
Concubine Kang who lost her son.

544
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:00,869
Not even for a day...

545
00:52:02,371 --> 00:52:05,092
was I considered a son.
I was merely a hostage.

546
00:52:08,893 --> 00:52:11,181
Should you not know that better,
Your Majesty?

547
00:52:19,389 --> 00:52:21,581
What will you be to the Crown Prince?

548
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:27,009
Will you be a Chungju Yoo
or a Shinju Kang?

549
00:52:36,112 --> 00:52:38,603
I will live as a loyal subject
of you and the Crown Prince.

550
00:52:38,603 --> 00:52:43,239
I will not be a son or a brother,
but a loyal subject.

551
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,069
Ji Mong.

552
00:52:52,072 --> 00:52:53,331
Yes, Your Majesty.

553
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,128
Did you say that the
4th Prince's star rose over Songak?

554
00:52:57,889 --> 00:53:01,429
Your star and the Crown Prince's star
are in perfect alignment.

555
00:53:01,429 --> 00:53:05,710
If the 4th Prince stays in Songak,
it is a sign of great fortune in Goryeo.

556
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:14,009
Tell the Kangs in Shinju
and all of Songak of this news.

557
00:53:15,029 --> 00:53:20,304
From this day forth, the 4th Prince,
Wang So, will be staying in Songak.

558
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:26,569
Thank you for your benevolence.

559
00:53:26,569 --> 00:53:28,810
Thank you for your benevolence,
Your Majesty.

560
00:53:46,703 --> 00:53:49,364
Do you have no appetite?

561
00:53:51,946 --> 00:53:55,493
Do not worry about me.
You need to eat.

562
00:54:01,293 --> 00:54:04,373
You are eating less and less.
It is worrisome.

563
00:54:08,614 --> 00:54:10,804
<i>Myung Hee, it's Soo.</i>

564
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,777
Come in.

565
00:54:22,777 --> 00:54:24,989
I called you here to come eat with us.

566
00:54:26,522 --> 00:54:29,259
I can just eat in my room.

567
00:54:29,259 --> 00:54:32,750
You've been sitting in your room
all day and barely eating.

568
00:54:33,889 --> 00:54:36,348
I thought it might be better
if we ate together.

569
00:54:36,348 --> 00:54:37,458
Sit down.

570
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:52,848
I know it was for the 14th Prince,
but it was dangerous to go alone.

571
00:54:53,848 --> 00:54:56,685
You don't know what could've happened
if our prince hadn't come.

572
00:54:57,163 --> 00:54:58,214
Yes.

573
00:55:00,098 --> 00:55:02,297
Thank you for saving me.

574
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:05,446
I only did what I should.

575
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,612
You're getting into trouble because
you're always out and about.

576
00:55:13,589 --> 00:55:15,500
You have no interest
in household affairs.

577
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:23,701
What about sewing or... knitting cotton?

578
00:55:24,681 --> 00:55:27,397
I'll look for something to interest me.

579
00:55:31,699 --> 00:55:33,348
I'll get going first.

580
00:55:34,378 --> 00:55:36,500
I have some books to read.

581
00:56:00,538 --> 00:56:02,074
Are you destroying it again?

582
00:56:04,967 --> 00:56:07,418
I'm not destroying it. I'm building it.

583
00:56:12,746 --> 00:56:14,264
What a surprise...

584
00:56:14,264 --> 00:56:16,203
What did you wish for?

585
00:56:18,134 --> 00:56:20,324
Do you need to know people's wishes now?

586
00:56:24,643 --> 00:56:27,413
I'm leaving this house now.

587
00:56:30,005 --> 00:56:31,837
I'm going to live in the palace.

588
00:56:33,134 --> 00:56:35,139
I won't be running into you so often.

589
00:56:36,569 --> 00:56:37,759
Oh.

590
00:56:39,877 --> 00:56:43,268
Oh, I guess I won't have to
deliver rice to you anymore.

591
00:56:43,268 --> 00:56:44,522
That's great.

592
00:56:45,638 --> 00:56:48,038
You didn't do it that often.
Stop trying to take credit.

593
00:56:48,038 --> 00:56:52,100
Please lead a quiet life in the palace.

594
00:56:54,567 --> 00:56:57,967
Don't threaten to kill or not kill
people all the time.

595
00:56:57,967 --> 00:57:01,677
Don't glare at people like you do
when they don't listen to you.

596
00:57:01,677 --> 00:57:05,485
Be especially careful not to
draw your sword over nothing.

597
00:57:05,808 --> 00:57:06,862
Oh yeah.

598
00:57:06,888 --> 00:57:09,558
Don't destroy something that
someone worked really hard to make.

599
00:57:09,558 --> 00:57:11,697
- What else is there?
- That's enough.

600
00:57:11,697 --> 00:57:13,002
Eat your meals properly.

601
00:57:14,902 --> 00:57:16,569
Sleep well, too.

602
00:57:17,652 --> 00:57:21,558
Try not to have bad dreams if you can.

603
00:57:32,042 --> 00:57:33,188
What is it?

604
00:57:34,764 --> 00:57:36,469
Why are you looking at me like that?

605
00:57:38,337 --> 00:57:39,371
Oh...

606
00:57:43,152 --> 00:57:45,382
I just remembered you said
you weren't scared of me.

607
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:50,335
How can you not be scared of me?

608
00:57:51,764 --> 00:57:54,712
I'm most scared of myself.

609
00:57:54,712 --> 00:57:56,268
Not you, Your Highness.

610
00:57:58,288 --> 00:58:03,496
Even though they're my feelings,
I can't figure out where they're headed.

611
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:08,096
No matter how much I try to
change direction...

612
00:58:10,322 --> 00:58:11,482
it's not working.

613
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:22,770
They wouldn't worry
about things like this.

614
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:31,750
Now that I'm in Goryeo,
there are a lot of stars here.

615
00:58:33,529 --> 00:58:35,368
What do you mean there are
a lot in Goryeo?

616
00:58:36,449 --> 00:58:39,590
You don't believe you can
only see stars in Goryeo, do you?

617
00:58:42,148 --> 00:58:44,232
Ji Mong would pass out if he knew.

618
00:58:51,781 --> 00:58:53,031
It's snowing.

619
00:59:01,989 --> 00:59:03,366
It's pretty.
