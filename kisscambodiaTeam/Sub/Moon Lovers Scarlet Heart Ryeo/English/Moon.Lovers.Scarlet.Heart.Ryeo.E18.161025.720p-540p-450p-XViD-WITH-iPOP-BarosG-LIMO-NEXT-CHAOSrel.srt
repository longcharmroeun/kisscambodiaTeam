4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,210
I will be marrying the king.

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,280
I will be the king's wife.

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,770
I will be the queen.

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,850
Unless I hear it from the king...

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,310
I will not believe it.

9
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,250
There are things the king cannot say.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,000
All of the families are deliberating
on how they can dethrone the king.

11
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:45,120
He put a stop to relocating
the capital city to Seokyeong.

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,330
The Yoos of Chungju are anxious because
someone they mistreated became king.

13
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,740
Also, the powerful families of Songak...

14
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,810
See?

15
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,700
These are the very things that
the king cannot speak to you about.

16
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:07,140
For you, this small and pretty room in
which you can wait for him is enough.

17
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,440
However, if a woman who is satisfied
with a mere room becomes the queen...

18
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,490
this nation will be in trouble.

19
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,340
His Majesty will have
to give up his throne.

20
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,830
Your Highness.

21
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,420
You're saying that you can stop it?

22
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,770
One more thing.

23
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:30,920
A king cannot marry a woman
with a scar on her body.

24
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,550
I've presented you with
how we will co-exist together.

25
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,270
It is up to you whether
or not things worsen.

26
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,820
I am a Hwangbo of Hwangju.

27
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,060
I am the daughter of the late King Taejo.

28
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,180
If I cannot do it, who can protect him?

29
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,460
That girl cannot become a queen.

30
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,090
If I say I will do it...

31
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,820
I will do it.

32
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,320
You must have forgotten.

33
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,070
In order to avoid marrying
the late King Taejo

34
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,210
she cut her own arm.

35
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,030
A woman with a scar on her body

36
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,560
cannot marry the king.

37
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,510
If you insist on marrying her,
there is one thing you can do.

38
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,950
You can give up the throne.

39
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,030
Which one do you want to give up?

40
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,900
Is it the throne?

41
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,850
Or is it Hae Soo?

42
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,650
I will not lose either.

43
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,540
Others may give up something.

44
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,980
I rose to the throne
in order to acquire everything.

45
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,040
So...

46
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:31,580
do you really think I would throw
Hae Soo aside over a scar on her body?

47
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,980
I...

48
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,020
became a king with a face like this.

49
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,270
<i>[Episode 18]</i>
I asked to see you because I have news.

50
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,050
The Yoos are requesting independence.

51
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,320
The ministers are asking for control
of the military and taxes again.

52
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,360
Since the relocating of the
capital city to Seokyeong was halted

53
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,160
the powerful families of those
districts have only been protesting.

54
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,990
The Chungju Yoos and Hwangju Hwangbos
are both turning on you.

55
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,460
This fight will not die down soon.

56
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,210
I think you're trying to say something.

57
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,940
Do not talk in circles.

58
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,160
Then I will get to the point.

59
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,780
You should marry Princess Yeon Hwa.

60
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,860
If you marry Princess Yeon Hwa,
all of your problems will be resolved.

61
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,160
That is the opinion we all have.

62
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,500
I decide who I marry.

63
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,720
It can't be...

64
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,030
You can't be thinking of marrying that
girl from the Damiwon like they say.

65
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,830
You must not be
too attached to the throne.

66
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,010
Watch what you are saying!

67
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,160
Whether it's the Chungju Yoos
or any other strong family

68
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,970
they will try to tear this nation apart.

69
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,960
Are you going to let Goryeo fall apart
during your reign, Your Majesty?

70
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,870
Your concern is excessive.

71
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,890
Your father worked too hard
to build this country.

72
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,340
He sacrificed so much.

73
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,780
He did so much to protect it.

74
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,570
That is the only reason I worry.

75
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,270
That is why I cast my son out.

76
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,080
And that is why I'm
offering up my daughter.

77
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,540
That was written by Hae Soo.

78
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,850
She writes words that no one knows.

79
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,600
Seeing what she did in the Damiwon,
she is not a normal girl.

80
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,740
She has no background.

81
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,640
Yet, she has many weaknesses.

82
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,660
I do not care about such things.

83
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,010
What is so great about this seat?

84
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,800
You know that you must die to leave it.

85
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,850
Chae Ryung.

86
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,180
You're here?

87
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,400
Did you get in trouble or something?

88
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,690
I have good news, so smile.

89
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,810
Good news, you say?

90
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:19,720
His Majesty has agreed
to let you stay in the palace.

91
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,380
Is that true?

92
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,060
But...

93
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,410
What is this about
Princess Yeon Hwa becoming the queen?

94
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,500
Why would she become the queen
instead of you, Lady Hae?

95
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,310
Princess Yeon Hwa has ordered us
to prepare for a royal marriage.

96
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,200
It's all a misunderstanding, isn't it?

97
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,760
Court Lady Hae.

98
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,970
This place used to be full of life.

99
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,630
The 10th Prince loved this flying wing.

100
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,300
<i>Wow! Look at this!</i>

101
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,250
<i>What is this? Wow!</i>

102
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,590
The 3rd Prince and 8th Prince
enjoyed reading those books over there.

103
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,620
And that picture of the stars?

104
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,870
The 14th Prince liked that a lot.

105
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,970
<i>See, that one is my star.</i>

106
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,830
<i>Oh, which one is mine?</i>

107
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,410
<i>You can't see it. It's too dark.</i>

108
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,860
<i>Yes. Thank you.</i>

109
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,440
The 9th Prince was always
asking me about alchemy.

110
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,430
Baek Ah was always busy drawing.

111
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,130
All of that went by
in the blink of an eye.

112
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,040
I know that you cared
about the princes very much.

113
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,550
Yes, very much.

114
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,370
That is why I'm going to say this.

115
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,070
Give up on marrying the king.

116
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,310
The king will be stubborn until the end.

117
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,600
You should let him go first.

118
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,020
I don't want to.

119
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,590
I've gone through a lot
and waited a long time.

120
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,450
I only did so because
I believed I would be happy one day.

121
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:32,350
If I were going to give up like this,
I would have given up long ago.

122
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,570
If the king is going to remain
steadfast, why would I do that?

123
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,710
I'm going to hold on.

124
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:49,240
What has happened
to everyone that was here?

125
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:02,150
In a palace where the king is in danger,
there is the smell of blood.

126
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,710
You don't know when and where
something may happen to him.

127
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,820
If someone dies
because of your stubbornness

128
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,960
will you be able to
absolve yourself of blame?

129
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,600
I have seen many people fall.

130
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,210
In order to stop another tragedy,
the throne must become stronger.

131
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,790
You may be able to be a source
of comfort for His Majesty

132
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,200
but you will not be able to be
his source of strength.

133
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,550
You are not the king's match.

134
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,290
Who said you could come in here
without permission?

135
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,950
It's just that everyone already knows
how much you favor me, Your Majesty.

136
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:16,050
Because of you, people will say that
I only look scary on the outside.

137
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,450
Then do you want to go outside
and have fun with me?

138
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,920
Have you forgotten?

139
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,170
It's the night of the exorcism rite.

140
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,230
It's not even the last day of December.

141
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,830
You can't go around outside
just because of the exorcism rite.

142
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:33,250
Not in the palace.
Let's go to the market.

143
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,040
Let's go to the market.

144
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,600
You want to leave the palace?

145
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,090
It's a bit sudden to go out.

146
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,150
We have to get the soldiers
and the court ladies ready.

147
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,160
No one will recognize us.

148
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:53,060
If you just wear something else,
no one will know that you are king.

149
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,000
Don't you remember?

150
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,810
Oh, this is...

151
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,940
It's not as good as the original,
but it's pretty to look at.

152
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,510
It's nice to look at.

153
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,620
It looks a place where your
wishes would come true, right?

154
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,200
Did you pile them up yourself
in order to get your proposal?

155
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
Yes, I did.

156
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,440
You said you would propose
to me at the prayer tower.

157
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,490
I was thirsty so I dug a well.

158
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,790
When I first met you,
you should have run away.

159
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,380
I ran away but you caught me.

160
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,070
I don't remember what
first drew you to me.

161
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,790
There are so many reasons now.

162
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,670
I have to live with you.

163
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,930
Let's live together.

164
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:49,320
Marry me.

165
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,350
I cannot.

166
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,630
I...

167
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,080
cannot do anything for you
except provide comfort.

168
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,910
It will be hard for me to marry you.

169
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,690
Who have you been talking to?

170
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,100
I will not give up on you over that scar.

171
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:34,780
No one can force me to.

172
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,970
I won't give up either.

173
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,870
I will continue to stay with you.

174
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:48,240
If I become a queen or your wife,
I'll be tied down by palace rules.

175
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,730
I won't be able to see you when I want
and I'll have to follow etiquette.

176
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,530
That doesn't suit me.

177
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,480
You know that.

178
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,520
I'll be all right.

179
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,120
I really...

180
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,330
am fine.

181
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,740
Even if I can't marry you...

182
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,830
you can't leave me.

183
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,270
I won't let you go.

184
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,070
You have to be mine.

185
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,920
You can't go anywhere.

186
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,110
I will never allow it.

187
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,540
You...

188
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,650
are my only queen.

189
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,610
Yeon Hwa of Hwangju's Hwangbo
will be the new queen.

190
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,970
Work well with the ministers.

191
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,770
Let us celebrate this matrimony.

192
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,470
Congratulations on being
proclaimed the queen.

193
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:17,400
Long live the queen.
May many blessings come.

194
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,060
Long live the queen.
May many blessings come!

195
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,610
<i>You...</i>

196
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,730
<i>are my only queen.</i>

197
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,350
I wasn't invited either.

198
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,350
Though Yeon Hwa told me I must come.

199
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,010
Are you going to stay even
after being treated like this?

200
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,250
Don't worry about me.

201
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,810
I'm not unhappy.

202
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:56,210
The late King Taejo told me not
to look too far ahead into the future.

203
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,280
He told me to treasure the present.

204
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,510
That is what I'm doing.

205
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,130
Why don't you just come to me then?

206
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,940
I would be good to you.

207
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,340
I am getting so tired of this place.

208
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,700
Let's go somewhere far away, like birds.

209
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:25,100
Yes, let's see everything
like butterflies and live freely.

210
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:29,700
I know you will take me far away to the
battlefields and make me watch you fight.

211
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,250
Just tell me you want it.

212
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,100
I will take you out of here.

213
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:37,390
Will you do anything
I want if I say I want it?

214
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,330
Yes. "I am willing."

215
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,460
You only need to say "I am willing."

216
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,950
Remember that.

217
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,320
"I am willing."

218
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:06,420
There will be many ways in which Hae Soo
can be used against you in the future.

219
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,300
- It is best to get rid of a risk--
- You.

220
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,660
Focus on being a queen.

221
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:18,460
Do not cross the line again.

222
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,070
My lady?

223
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,720
Are you all right?

224
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:15,480
When your heart is hurting,
your other ailments start to hurt more.

225
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,480
Thank you.

226
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:29,170
I remember how Lady Hae used to pile
these stones at the 8th Prince's home.

227
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,020
Yes.

228
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,710
She did build many of these.

229
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,730
I miss her.

230
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,380
What are you praying for?

231
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,720
I wasn't praying for anything.

232
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,840
I was thinking of my mother
who passed away.

233
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,150
I'm doing very well.

234
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,160
My younger siblings are doing well, too.

235
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,660
You were ill before. Are you better now?

236
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,540
I wanted to make you better.

237
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:20,310
Still, it's a relief that
you didn't get sicker.

238
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,640
I think that every now and then.

239
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,690
I am doing very well.

240
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:49,270
I... am doing very well.

241
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,590
Doing very well.

242
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,850
Now that you are all in here,
I am feeling extremely satisfied.

243
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:27,210
So, in light of my enthronement

244
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,620
I'd like to designate
the era name for my reign.

245
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,260
His Majesty would like
to call this era "Gwangdeok."

246
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,290
It is a good name, isn't it?

247
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,760
We will do as you wish, Your Majesty.

248
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,550
Also, as you commanded

249
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:49,110
we are looking into how to distribute
rice to those who were forced into labor.

250
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,640
Ah, as for the management
of the finances...

251
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,570
please leave it to us.

252
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,590
Let's do that.

253
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,270
With ministers as trustworthy as you all

254
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,320
I can go and enjoy hunting.

255
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,070
I think I will catch up on my reading.

256
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,100
Astronomer Ji Mong wanted me to read:

257
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,660
"Essentials of Government
in the Zhenguan Reign."

258
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,790
There is no better book
to learn the principles of virtue.

259
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,670
Also, the 14th Prince Wang Jung...

260
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,520
is guilty of treason and will be punished
by having to return to his hometown.

261
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,580
Your Majesty.

262
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,990
You must have a clear reason for the
weight of this punishment to make sense.

263
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:45,950
He created suspicion of my abdication
by questioning the late king's wishes.

264
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,960
He opposed me with purpose.

265
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,610
Taking into consideration that he is
a brother with whom I share a mother

266
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:54,130
I am not executing him,
only removing him from office.

267
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,510
I will send him to his family in Chungju.

268
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:01,990
If he even steps foot
into Songak after today

269
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,820
he will be put to death.

270
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,620
Sent to his hometown?

271
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:23,540
My Jung is being sent back home?

272
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,700
Queen Mother! Call the doctor!

273
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,450
Sent to his hometown?

274
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,840
He's being exiled to his hometown.

275
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,580
It's the biggest punishment
after execution.

276
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:50,440
He has been removed from his position
of Grand General and all titles.

277
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,800
He will not be allowed
to return to Songak.

278
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,970
He cannot go anywhere
but his home in Chungju.

279
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,520
He is a person who
led an army of 300,000.

280
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,180
He felt trapped in this palace
and jumped over those walls daily.

281
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,730
You say he'll be trapped in his home?

282
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:11,040
We must talk to the king.
If something happens to Jung--

283
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,600
You cannot get involved.

284
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,760
You have no son.

285
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,800
You could get hurt if you get involved.

286
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,980
It isn't simply an argument
between brothers anymore.

287
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,400
Woo Hee is right.

288
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,020
You should keep an eye on it for now.

289
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,750
Talk to the king once
he has calmed down a little bit.

290
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,860
How is the Queen Mother?

291
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,300
The doctor told us that neither
Your Majesty nor His Majesty

292
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,590
should leave the Queen Mother if you can.

293
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,690
Jung...

294
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,770
Bring Jung to me.

295
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,610
I will bring the king.

296
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,940
Jung...

297
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,310
I need to see Jung.

298
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,640
Jung.

299
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,770
Your Majesty.

300
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,570
I will take care of the
Queen Mother myself from now on.

301
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:31,300
No one may enter this room
without my permission.

302
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,910
You need to recover soon.

303
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,180
Mother.

304
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,370
I must see the Queen Mother. Move.

305
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,760
I said move!

306
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,900
I won't take a single step
until I see my mother. Move.

307
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,700
Please let Jung inside.

308
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,060
If something happens to the Queen Mother

309
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,670
it will haunt you forever.

310
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,320
You sent for Jung, didn't you?

311
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,550
I forbade everyone
from sending him a message.

312
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,320
You are the only person who would do it.

313
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,820
Yes.

314
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,070
I did it.

315
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:57,470
He is apart from his mother and cannot
see her, so he should be at her deathbed.

316
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:01,000
He would be executed for his return.

317
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,760
Your Majesty.

318
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,540
Forget about the deathbed.

319
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,010
Be relieved that I haven't killed him.

320
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:16,160
If Jung is allowed into the palace...

321
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,640
I will not let it go, even if it is you.

322
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:05,810
It has been five days and you haven't
even had a sip of water I've given you.

323
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,090
Do you plan on dying like this?

324
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,680
Jung.

325
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,040
Jung.

326
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,580
Jung.

327
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,080
Look.

328
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,770
Which son is by your side now?

329
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,180
The complete and perfect Yo...

330
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,850
is in the afterlife now.

331
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:57,170
Jung, who is the apple of your eye,
can't even be by your side.

332
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,240
All you have is me.

333
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,950
I have become king
and I am protecting you.

334
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:21,340
You will remember today.

335
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,570
You threw me away today, Mother.

336
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:29,290
But I will not leave.

337
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,230
From now on...

338
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,980
I will make sure I'm all you see.

339
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,150
I will build a temple in your honor.

340
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,340
I will build the largest and
grandest temple in all of Goryeo

341
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:55,790
that perfectly honors you, Mother.

342
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:02,380
Also, I will create stories about our
relationship and spread them everywhere.

343
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:06,490
I will tell them
how much you cared for me.

344
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,960
And how fond I was of you, Mother.

345
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,580
We will be a mother and a son
who loved one another so much.

346
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,160
Everyone will know about it.

347
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,630
And I...

348
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:25,060
I will become your
one and only precious son.

349
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,490
This...

350
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:36,580
is my revenge...

351
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,810
for being thrown away by you.

352
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:58,230
You can leave now.

353
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,880
I will take good care of Mother.

354
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,750
Your punishment will be re-instated soon.

355
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,470
Why are you on Jung's side too?

356
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,200
You, of all people, should be on my side!

357
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,050
This is not about taking sides.

358
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:44,280
Because of your ego,
Jung was not at her deathbed.

359
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,240
He is not the pitiful one.

360
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,540
It was always me who was cast aside!

361
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,070
Your Majesty.

362
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,570
Right before she died...

363
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:56,210
she finally touched this face of mine.

364
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,910
In all my 25 years of life,
I have never had her to myself.

365
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,730
Is it so wrong to send her off on my own?

366
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,710
You...

367
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,580
should have said you understood me.

368
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:55,110
Who was it that put the mercury
in the bath at the Damiwon?

369
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:59,750
It was Wook, wasn't it?

370
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,920
I don't know anything about it.

371
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:08,330
The girl who was a servant
at Wook's home, Chae Ryung...

372
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,890
was she not a servant
in your home originally?

373
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:16,660
Wasn't it you and Wook
who put her in the Damiwon?

374
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:22,870
The attack on our oldest brother
and Wang Gyu's Revolt...

375
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,440
Those were all Wook's ideas, right?

376
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:30,380
If it wasn't Wook...

377
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:34,700
I will have to assume it was you.

378
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,520
It wasn't me.

379
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,320
You know I don't have
the capacity for that.

380
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,100
If you continue to hide it

381
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,770
we will punish you for selling silver to
merchants by fooling them of the weight.

382
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,640
The punishment is being
put into a boiling cauldron.

383
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,290
I only did the things that I was told.

384
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:06,340
It was all... Wook.

385
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,250
He planned it with the late king.

386
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:36,440
Then... I will ask you one more thing.

387
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:03,750
- Woo Hee.
- Yes.

388
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:06,130
What's with the mood here?

389
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,710
Where is Chae Ryung?

390
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,590
What's going on? Why are you all here?

391
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:30,180
The king wants us to watch.

392
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,010
The king?

393
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:36,030
He says that is what will happen
if you speak carelessly in the palace.

394
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:49,750
What is going on? Why would he do this?

395
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,420
Why would he do such an awful thing?

396
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,360
A Damiwon court lady
committed a serious crime.

397
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:58,100
She is being punished by a beating.

398
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,260
A Damiwon court lady?

399
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,570
Who is it?

400
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:13,440
Who is it?

401
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:17,270
It is Chae Ryung.

402
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,750
Soo!

403
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,500
Soo, Soo!

404
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:00,630
My name is Hae Soo.

405
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:05,990
You are my servant, Chae Ryung. Right?

406
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:10,100
Yes, of course!

407
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:19,400
What happened?

408
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,520
Why didn't you tell me she was ill?

409
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,320
My apologies, Your Majesty.

410
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:29,110
Get out.

411
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,970
Chae Ryung...

412
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,350
Chae Ryung.

413
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:56,370
You can't get up yet.

414
00:45:58,210 --> 00:45:59,280
Soo.

415
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,480
Go away!

416
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:04,170
Soo.

417
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:05,710
How could you?

418
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,810
How could you do that?

419
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:13,610
How could you do that to a person?

420
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,750
You beat her to death like a dog?

421
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:28,430
Chae Ryung... had been
spying on you this whole time.

422
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,220
What?

423
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:33,320
She told the 9th Prince about us.

424
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,510
<i>You still lots of work to do here.</i>

425
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,640
That information got to the Queen Mother.

426
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:40,810
Hae Soo wrote this.

427
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:43,670
She took your belongings
from the Damiwon.

428
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:47,240
They created suspicion
that you were a foreign spy.

429
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,580
- Is this writing too?
- Yes, it is.

430
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:55,560
You should learn to read and write too.

431
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,540
How can I learn at this age?

432
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:03,490
She holds some responsibility for
preventing us from getting married.

433
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:09,830
It was also Chae Ryung
who put the mercury into Moo's bath.

434
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:13,500
<i>You and I are the only ones
who are there for his baths.</i>

435
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,860
<i>So, what is this about mercury?</i>

436
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:18,250
<i>It wasn't me.</i>

437
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,200
<i>I'm telling the truth.</i>

438
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,230
Do you remember when
you first entered the palace?

439
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:30,830
Through the cave that comes up
to the Damiwon's bath.

440
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,600
It was Chae Ryung who first
told you about that place.

441
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,490
Lady, we need to get going now!

442
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,330
Be careful.

443
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,710
Chae Ryung learned about it
from the 9th Prince.

444
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:49,320
That was why Eun couldn't run away.

445
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:55,000
The 9th Prince and Wook knew about it
and had the royal guards waiting there.

446
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:01,310
<i>Soo.</i>

447
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,570
<i>How could I have forgotten this place?</i>

448
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:06,090
<i>Chae Ryung told me about it.</i>

449
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:08,100
<i>I said I was frustrated
being unable to see you.</i>

450
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,780
Wook knew about that place...

451
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:15,980
That was...

452
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:28,580
She was trying to stay
by your side to keep us apart.

453
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:31,280
She was waiting for
a moment to harm you.

454
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:38,000
I had no reason or need to forgive her.

455
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:42,240
That girl...

456
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,470
That girl...

457
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,950
her only crime was
being born as a slave.

458
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,760
She was my little sister.

459
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:14,650
Rest.

460
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,410
Get more rest.

461
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:20,300
Forget everything.

462
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,060
It was Wook.

463
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:20,020
It all came from his head.

464
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,410
It all started with him.

465
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,460
He dares to use the throne as bait.

466
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:30,520
And thinks he can play around with me
however he pleases?

467
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,560
Your Majesty.

468
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,420
You should look into it some more.

469
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,500
Who do I have left?

470
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:42,390
All I have is you and Hae Soo.

471
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:48,040
It's all because of Wook.

472
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:52,250
Now I've become a monster to Soo.

473
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:56,140
I will never let him get away with this.

474
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,760
<i>Dear Lady Hae Soo.</i>

475
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,970
<i>I received this here.</i>

476
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:22,540
<i>I don't know how to read.</i>

477
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,330
<i>I only know my name.</i>

478
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:32,460
How much of it was a lie?

479
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:50,250
<i>My lady, please watch over my family.</i>

480
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,430
<i>I know the end is coming soon.</i>

481
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:57,530
<i>I wanted to admit everything to you.</i>

482
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:01,100
<i>I don't have the chance
to do that anymore.</i>

483
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:08,480
<i>I am just a person who couldn't
stop loving once I started.</i>

484
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,190
<i>I'm a foolish person like that.</i>

485
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,770
Please help me.

486
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:19,670
- Give me a little, please.
- Go!

487
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:25,360
Help me, please! I'll do anything.

488
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:27,900
Just a little bit of help.

489
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:32,650
I like your persistence, little girl.

490
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:36,160
Thank you. Thank you!

491
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:08,140
<i>I'm certain that you
will understand how I feel.</i>

492
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,970
<i>Chae Ryung doesn't regret it.</i>

493
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,540
<i>I don't resent anyone.</i>

494
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:19,740
<i>Whether there is value
in doing something or not...</i>

495
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,540
<i>that is something only you
can answer for yourself.</i>

496
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:02,230
Soo.

497
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:06,490
Are you no longer angry?

498
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,830
I told you not to get greedy.

499
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:53,120
You were fooled by a mere mask.

500
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,260
Get out.

501
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:02,630
You told me to be satisfied
just being a queen.

502
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,370
Then you should make this deal properly.

503
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:12,010
We are after the same thing within
the Goryeo household, Your Majesty.

504
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,800
You want to protect the throne and I...

505
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:19,810
need an heir.

506
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:26,510
I need to make our son into a king.

507
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:44,660
What if I tell you to turn your back
on Wook and your family?

508
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:46,490
Can you do it?

509
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,080
Can you completely turn on
your brother and family?

510
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:57,830
If you become my only queen...

511
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:05,420
then I will make our child
the Crown Prince.

512
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:12,970
You will be the queen
and the Queen Mother.

513
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:51,560
The room was empty
so I came to see if you were here.

514
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,430
What should I do now?

515
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:58,260
The person I love...

516
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:02,390
killed my little sister.

517
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:07,220
The king knew long ago that
Chae Ryung was up to something.

518
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:09,960
That's why he tried to get her to
leave the palace and your side.

519
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,710
But she latched on to you.

520
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:17,510
If she had not tried
to stay in the palace longer

521
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:20,230
he would not have done that.

522
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:22,060
No matter what she did wrong...

523
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:25,380
how could he punish her so cruelly?

524
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,730
I don't know how to escape this misery.

525
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:37,530
Chae Ryung...

526
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:41,460
was just a person in love.

527
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:47,620
Don't do that.

528
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:52,880
When you make that face,
even I get anxious.

00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:55,740
How do you think my brother feels?

530
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:00,290
He is very worried.

531
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,670
He is genuinely concerned.

532
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:16,930
I have a favor to ask.

533
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,280
Give this to Jung.

534
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:32,300
You have to give him
this message, as well.

535
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:37,760
What is it?

536
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:46,850
"I am willing."

537
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:54,960
If he does it...

538
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,420
you won't be sad anymore, right?

539
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,250
That's right.

540
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:04,130
"I am willing."

541
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:15,580
Hae Soo... desperately...

542
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:21,790
wants it.
