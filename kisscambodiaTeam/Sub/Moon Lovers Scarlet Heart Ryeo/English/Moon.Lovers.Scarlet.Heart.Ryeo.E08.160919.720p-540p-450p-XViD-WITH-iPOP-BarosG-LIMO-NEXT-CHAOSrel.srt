3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,390
Your Highness...

4
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,180
Look at me.

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,210
Look at me properly.

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,640
Your eyes...

7
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,910
That look in your eyes...

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,120
I hate it like crazy.

9
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,260
So don't ever look at me like that again.

10
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,570
How did I look at you?

11
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,100
I've never looked at you in a
different way, Your Highness.

12
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,110
You feel sorry for me. You pity me!

13
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,880
Did you think I would be grateful for it?

14
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,830
Do you know what if feels like to get
charity from someone like you?

15
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,770
Stay out of my sight.

16
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:33,820
Next time... I don't know what I'll do.

17
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,710
I'm sorry I could not stop it.

18
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,270
Eun also regrets it a lot,
so please don't be angry.

19
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,980
I noticed you did not look at me.

20
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,660
What?

21
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,080
Why did you close your eyes instead
of taking a good look at me?

22
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,540
I thought you wouldn't like it.

23
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,080
Have I offended you?

24
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,730
It really is true that a person's
feelings are the most complicated.

25
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,350
I feel upset with one person for seeing
and upset with another for not seeing.

26
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,800
I can't figure out my feelings either.

27
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,560
Always look straight at me,
no matter what.

28
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,110
I would like it if you did.

29
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,860
Yes.

30
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,360
About Hae Soo...

31
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,940
I think she was manipulated by Yo.

32
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,440
Do not bring that up.

33
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,580
I don't want to hear it.

34
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,820
I see you've become a
Damiwon lady already.

35
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,420
It is all thanks to you, Your Majesty.

36
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,750
I assume you're still getting along
well with the princes.

37
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,840
I am unable to meet them
as often as before.

38
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,100
I see you are still intelligent.

39
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,660
You know your place.

40
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,260
It is time to brush the king's hair.

41
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,770
<i>Queen Yoo has arrived.</i>

42
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,280
I will do it.

43
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:12,470
You want to use this measly
wooden hairpin for the king?

44
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,220
The drought is severe.
I told her to keep my clothing simple.

45
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,040
This is moxa tea.

46
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,300
Thank you.

47
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,220
This is white tea.

48
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,290
Thank you.

49
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,790
Oh! This is pear juice.

50
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,200
It's my very favorite, Soo.

51
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,200
Mine is green tea.

52
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,880
You must have prepared
our favorites on purpose.

53
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,990
If you are enjoying your drinks,
there is nothing more I want.

54
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,070
- This is fresh leaf tea.
- Take it away.

55
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,840
This is not the time for tea.

56
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,990
- Pardon me?
- There is a drought. Tea?

57
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,140
The 4th Prince is right.

58
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,800
There has been a drought
since last winter.

59
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,130
The people of this country
are crying out to the heavens.

60
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,660
We must live simply and show restraint.

61
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,670
Are you sure you looked into
the favor I asked of you?

62
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,770
I did.

63
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,190
The 4th Prince's favorite drink
is fresh leaf tea.

64
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,230
His favorite snack is
oil and honey pastry.

65
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,330
- Are you sure?
- I told you that I am.

66
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,220
<i>[13th Prince Baek Ah]</i>
You didn't want it to be obvious,
so I even found out everyone's favorites.

67
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,420
Gosh, then why isn't he even touching it?

68
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,550
I'm illiterate and I studied
so hard to do all of this.

69
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,580
Ask my brother yourself then.

70
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,290
Ask him what you need to do in order
for him to get over his anger.

71
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,560
I need him to look at me
in order to ask him.

72
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,060
He seems to have made up with the others.

73
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,600
- Why is he acting that way to me?
- That is true.

74
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,310
He forgave our 10th brother right away.

75
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,750
You don't think that So and you--

76
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,940
Yes, I will do as you ask.

77
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,000
What? You're leaving already?

78
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,620
What... what are you doing?

79
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,910
How are you so pretty
even when you are glaring at me?

80
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,300
Are you insane?

81
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,370
This is your punishment for being
unable to appease my fourth brother.

82
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,640
Well, Soo.

83
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,450
I will see you again, all right?

84
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,810
Oh! Go on.

85
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,210
He is trying to kill me.

86
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,670
His Highness went too far
with his jokes, don't you think?

87
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,520
Oh my!

88
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,080
Oh dear. I'm so sorry about that.

89
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,170
What's going on here?

90
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,830
"Newly Revised
Materia Medica: Tang Edition."

91
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,600
It's a medical book on
the use of over 100 medicines.

92
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,110
"Supplement to Materia Medica."

93
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,330
It is a book about many medicinal plants
by Chen Cang Qi from the Tang Dynasty.

94
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,570
I already read it all.

95
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,010
Really?

96
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,420
Then, I'd better give you more books.

97
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,520
Think about what you did wrong
for four hours.

98
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,530
It is all your fault.

99
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,250
What?

100
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,740
A mere court lady being close to princes
is what is causing all of these problems.

101
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:45,710
Do not ever talk to the princes
or even look their way.

102
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,780
Then you will not suffer like this.

103
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,670
I have known the princes since
even before I entered the palace.

104
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,300
I have not been flirting with or
seducing them like the others imagine.

105
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,530
You are mistaken if you think
you cannot cut off relationships.

106
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,940
Look at the wound on your arm.

107
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,340
You ended your relationship
to the king with one cut.

108
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,130
I refuse to see the Damiwon
in disarray because of you.

109
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,810
Stay away from the princes.

110
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,260
Yes.

111
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,360
By the way, why is it that you
only eat porridge, Court Lady Oh?

112
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,530
I have never seen you eat a proper meal.

113
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,860
If I consume foods with too much flavor

114
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,180
it is difficult to
discern the tea flavor.

115
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,820
Hold it up straight!

116
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,550
There's no food because of the drought.

117
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,750
There's nothing to do for fun!

118
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,190
Oh! You scared me.

119
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,380
Aren't you the bear fur girl?

120
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,030
<i>[10th Prince Eun]</i>
Why are you here again?

121
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,740
I... I... I...

122
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,770
I...

123
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,590
- So, I...
- What, what, what?

124
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,410
Do you know if there's
anything to do for fun?

125
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,120
When will the sparrow come?

126
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,430
When is it going to come?

127
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,980
Forget this!
How long do I have to wait...

128
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,690
I caught it. I caught it!

129
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,440
Did you see that? I caught it.

130
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,090
Then, are we going to
cook this and eat it?

131
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,930
How many more should we catch?

132
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,000
Murderer!

133
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,600
How could you break the neck
of that cute, little thing?

134
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,280
You still call yourself a person?

135
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,610
Did he want to eat it alive?

136
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,220
Hey.

137
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,460
It's burning.

138
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,250
It's all burning.

139
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,160
<i>[Grand General Park Soo Kyung]</i>
What kind of a man
can't even catch a bird?

140
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,580
What use is he?

141
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,170
I can catch them.

142
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,240
Then how will he protect
his wife and children?

143
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,780
I can protect us.

144
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,970
Gosh.

145
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:01,770
I don't suppose you want to
change your mind, do you?

146
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,450
I have only one path.
subtitles ripped,synced and added missing lines by riri13

147
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,930
Gosh... what!

148
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:13,530
Hey! Do you think I taught you how to
fight so you could attack me over a boy?

149
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:17,030
Why, you! All right, fine then.

150
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,650
Do whatever you want.

151
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,470
<i>We will hold a rain ritual.</i>

152
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,590
<i>You should all stay out of
the Damiwon for now.</i>

153
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,070
"Yok Hyul."

154
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,280
"Yok" as in "washing"
and "Hyul" as in "hole."

155
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,980
Your Highness.

156
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,580
Soo.

157
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,960
How could I have forgotten this place?

158
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,370
Chae Ryung told me about it.

159
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,540
I told her I was frustrated
because I could not see you.

160
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,410
How did a place like this
even come to exist?

161
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:58,380
Though, I am very lucky it exists.

162
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,730
You could be outside the palace
if you left this place.

163
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,080
Don't you want to leave?

164
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,680
I suppose so.

165
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,430
All I need to do is take a few steps.

166
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:22,080
I miss Chae Ryung and
I want to go to the market.

167
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,020
I want to visit Myung Hee too.

168
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:31,400
The 4th Prince told me something
when I first entered the palace.

169
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,860
No matter where I run,
I'll be in the palm of the king's hand.

170
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:40,380
There is nowhere in Goryeo
I can escape the eyes of the king.

171
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,120
Yes.

172
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,280
There is no place his power cannot reach.

173
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,290
Damiwon is a place that suits me well.

174
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,010
Until the time comes for me to be
allowed to leave the palace officially

175
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,130
I will work hard and live well.

176
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,810
Until then...

177
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,240
can you not forget me?

178
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,750
Soon, there will be a large rain ritual.

179
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,680
If there is rain after the ritual,
the king will grant favors to celebrate.

180
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,110
He will pardon a criminal
or allow a royal marriage.

181
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,720
Or hold a feast for an elder.

182
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,360
Also...

183
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,520
he allows a court lady
to leave her service.

184
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,670
I see.

185
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,420
What?

186
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,030
Leave service?

187
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:57,320
If the rain falls,
I will request that you leave the palace.

188
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,930
Then I can go back to your home again,
Your Highness?

189
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,550
When you do...

190
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,520
I'll find all the
medicinal herbs in Songak

191
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,840
and buy what you need to make soap.

192
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,670
I will fill the house with them.

193
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:20,660
Chae Ryung and Princess Yeon Hwa
will complain so much.

194
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,960
I wish it would rain.

195
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,920
It has to.

196
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,780
Yes.

197
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,290
It has to.

198
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,860
You must never scratch them and
remember not to use cold water.

199
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,430
I am off to catch groups of thieves
that have appeared since the drought.

200
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,720
- Would I have water to wash?
- Oh...

201
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,320
Lady Soo, I'm sure you know.

202
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,570
Shh, you must keep quiet.

203
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,310
Shh, of course.

204
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,860
I sneaked out on my own. Don't worry.

205
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,990
I left a necklace on your desk
in your room at the Damiwon.

206
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,830
It's in return for your help.

207
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,460
Oh, thank you.

208
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,230
We are ready to go.

209
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,750
Okay, let's go.

210
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,910
What are you doing? Let me go.

211
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,420
Where are you taking me?
Please, let me go.

212
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,450
Your... Your Majesty.

213
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,690
<i>[Queen Yoo]</i>

214
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,550
Where have you been?

215
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:45,650
I was off running an errand.

216
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,590
You were with the Crown Prince.

217
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,970
I said goodbye to the Crown Prince
before he went to fight the rebellion.

218
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:55,730
Why do you have so much with you
when you were just saying goodbye?

219
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,420
Well, that's...

220
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,880
They are all precious items that should
not be outside of the Damiwon.

221
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,820
Did the Crown Prince tell you
to bring these things?

222
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,050
That's not it.

223
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:13,130
I had an errand to run elsewhere and
I stopped by to see the Crown Prince.

224
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,570
Then, what are these precious
medicines being used for?

225
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,890
Is the Crown Prince ill, by any chance?

226
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,080
With what?

227
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:33,130
I do not know anything.

228
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,710
You don't know?

229
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,850
You dare to test me?

230
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,860
Please let her go!

231
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,360
She is returning from
Cheondeokjeon Palace under my orders.

232
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,620
Cheondeokjeon Palace?

233
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,180
Court Lady Oh.

234
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,000
You are mocking me.

235
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,120
His Majesty's knees have been
injured from the rain ritual.

236
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,010
I sent her to give him
medicinal ointment.

237
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,190
It is the law of the Damiwon
not to speak of the king.

238
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:15,480
I am only informing you so that this
misunderstanding does not grow larger.

239
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,410
Why would you send this child?

240
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:24,020
She has not been at the Damiwon long
and you send her to treat the king?

241
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:30,150
Then... should it have been me?

242
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,170
What?

243
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,520
I asked if you'd have preferred
me going to see the king.

244
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:41,500
Then would there have been
no misunderstanding?

245
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,440
The Damiwon is under my jurisdiction
just as the king has commanded.

246
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,310
I will see to the punishment
of that child.

247
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,290
Why are you here?

248
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,660
Don't be nervous.

249
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,760
I'm not planning to stay for long.

250
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,830
I can't stand being with you even for a moment.

251
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,130
Better get going now!

252
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,960
Why?

253
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,770
Are you afraid that I'll come to you

254
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:35,570
after killing people like last time?

255
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:37,640
No.

256
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,140
I have not thought of that.

257
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,070
There is no smell of blood today.

258
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:44,810
Only the smell of a monster.

259
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:48,710
Just tell me what you want.

260
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,920
No matter how much
you hate Court Lady Oh

261
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,120
you should have maintained
your dignity as a queen.

262
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,590
If you make noise in Damiwon in that way,

263
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,120
everyone will gossip behind you,

264
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,730
saying you can't even let young maidens off.

265
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,900
And that it is karma to have a son like me.

266
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,470
What?

267
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,600
So please respect yourself.

268
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,470
Stop blaming innocent people too.

269
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,040
We don't need to talk
like this to each other, right?

270
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,540
Then...

271
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,810
That crazy bastard.

272
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,260
Don't tell me...

273
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,430
It is because of the Hae family?

274
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,920
Court Lady Oh.

275
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,020
Thank you. What actually happened was...

276
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,800
I told you to stay away
from the Crown Prince.

277
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,840
There is no end to your arrogance.

278
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,270
I should never have taken you in.

279
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,240
I regret it.

280
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,020
Court Lady Oh.

281
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:13,370
What... what have I done so wrong?

282
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,860
You make medicinal herbs.

283
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,630
How does it differ if I make
medicinal herbs for the Crown Prince?

284
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:23,540
I know how to help him.
Why do you keep telling me to ignore him?

285
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,740
You lecture me and punish me
more than any other court lady.

286
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:29,200
I can't figure out why,
no matter how much I think about it.

287
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,980
You do not know the palace.

288
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,750
- You don't know it all.
- No, I don't know it.

289
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,840
So why don't you teach me?

290
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,780
I... I feel like this is all unfair.

291
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,640
I am always trying so hard
to get through it.

292
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,760
Why is it that you hate me so much?

293
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,300
I am so hurt, frustrated,
and feel mistreated.

294
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,500
Because when I look at you,
I am reminded of myself!

295
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,560
You trust people.

296
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,840
You are good to others
and you have no fear.

297
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,200
A girl like you should
not be in the palace.

298
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,930
A girl like you could easily die.

299
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,780
I feel so anxious...

300
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,460
Court Lady! Court Lady!

301
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,890
Are you all right, Court Lady?

302
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:16,920
Court Lady Oh! Please, wake up.

303
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,980
Court Lady Oh! Court Lady!

304
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,630
Are you feeling better?

305
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,280
What happened?

306
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,490
You had severe stomach pains,
so you lost consciousness.

307
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:51,730
The doctor sneaked out of the
Cheondeokjeon Palace to see you.

308
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:52,930
Did he?

309
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,830
No one else knows, do they?

310
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,140
Don't worry.

311
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:04,780
I will keep it a secret that you lost
strength from only eating porridge.

312
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,200
This is pine nut porridge.

313
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,420
The doctor said it is all right to eat.

314
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,160
I'm all right, so leave it and go.

315
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,730
I'm going to watch you finish eating
and then I will leave.

316
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,550
Do not be stubborn. I told you to leave.

317
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,880
Speaking to me like that won't work.

318
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,540
What?

319
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,270
I know why you treated me
that way all this time.

320
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:32,980
You were worried that I would
make a mistake and die.

321
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,980
You saw me hurt my arm, as well.

322
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,780
You said that I'm a lot like you,
Court Lady Oh.

323
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:49,140
I'll be very, very careful just like you.

324
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,050
I'll be able to live well.

325
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:57,090
So you should learn to depend on others
when you're sick like this.

326
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:59,840
It's okay to do it.

327
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,970
Please eat.

328
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,500
My arm hurt so much from
grinding up the pine nuts.

329
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,670
This is porridge?

330
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:52,180
<i>All the people want a rain calling ritual</i>

331
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,720
<i>but my body can't keep up</i>

332
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,320
<i>and the Crown Prince can't make it back yet.</i>

333
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:04,070
<i>Your Majesty, why don't we
choose one of the princes?</i>

334
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:07,440
<i>If one whose energy overflows
with water were to head up the ritual</i>

335
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,660
<i>the people will feel more at ease.</i>

336
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,320
Your Highness Wang Won.

337
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,890
You were born in the year of the dog.

338
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,850
That's right.

339
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:20,690
What is this all about?

340
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:29,470
- Ji Mong, can't you just leave me out?
- Pardon?

341
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:32,130
I don't like being included
in these things.

342
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:36,020
What if I'm picked
and people criticize me?

343
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,830
It will be scary.

344
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:42,370
Eun, how can life always be easy?

345
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:45,510
Regardless of who is picked,
rainfall is what is important.

346
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:50,160
Wook, what happens if it does not rain?

347
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,200
You'll have to die.

348
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,400
Die?

349
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:57,720
Before this nation was founded,
the people killed the king themselves.

350
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,330
They say the blood of the king
was spilled in request for rain.

351
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,860
Ji Mong! Take my name out!

352
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:09,210
No, no. I'm sure no one will kill you.

353
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,780
If it's like Yo said...

354
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:14,950
the whole nation will be angry if it
doesn't rain, so how can we survive that?

355
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,750
It won't rain because of the rain ritual.

356
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,130
You do the rain ritual until it rains.

357
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,410
A person cannot move the heavens.

358
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,000
You just need to make it look that way.

359
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:50,420
4th Prince Wang So,
born in the year of the rooster.

360
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,890
Ji Mong.

361
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:26,350
4th Prince, Wang So.

362
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,490
What?

363
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:36,650
This is the heavens' will.

364
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,420
You will lead the rain ritual.

365
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,860
I will do so.

366
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,640
Does it make sense that I was chosen?

367
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,470
I suppose the heavens
felt you were necessary.

368
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:59,840
What are you worried about?
The heavens chose you, Your Highness.

369
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,970
It is not good to doubt yourself.

370
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:07,950
Yes, I was chosen.

371
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,260
Please give us rain. Please rain.

372
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,650
- The 4th Prince?
- It's the 4th Prince.

373
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:36,680
Please let it rain.
- The 4th Prince?
- It's the 4th Prince.

374
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,920
Please let it rain.

375
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,460
Who is that?

376
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,130
Hey, what's going on?

377
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,690
Isn't that the 4th Prince?

378
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,110
How could this be?

379
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,200
Why is it him of all people?

380
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:08,650
How can a man in a mask
be the master of the ritual?

381
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:11,320
What if you anger the heavens?

382
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,910
He's a monster, not a person!

383
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:16,010
Gosh! This is bad luck.

384
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:17,760
Goodness, this is bad.

385
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,620
We need someone to bring rain.

386
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:01,570
Give us a son to bring rain!

387
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:04,960
Your Majesty, are you casting us aside?

388
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,530
Let us through!

389
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,160
Your Majesty!

390
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,750
How can you do this to us?

391
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:45,530
Your Majesty,
are you turning your back on us?

392
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,210
I told you that an opportunity
would come again if you waited.

393
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:06,600
This rain ritual is an optimal time
to change the Crown Prince.

394
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,080
You must not lose this opportunity.

395
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,310
I have already sent thieves to stop
the Crown Prince on his way home.

396
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:13,480
It may difficult for him to return
at the moment.

397
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:18,440
So does not blink an eye when he kills.

398
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,220
Yet he falls apart so easily
when you mention his face.

399
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:27,170
I really do think he is someone the
heavens turned their back on.

400
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,150
Why was it that he happened to be
chosen when I had plans for it?

401
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,300
I do wonder what
the king and Choi Ji Mong

402
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,390
were thinking when they chose him.

403
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,550
Chose him?

404
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,230
How could they have known who to choose?

405
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:42,950
Do you believe the heavens
can move people?

406
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,690
That is all nonsense.

407
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:49,000
People move the heavens.

408
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,460
The rain ritual is the same.

409
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,210
Whoever leads it
can lead it until it rains.

410
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:03,200
This time I must see you
take hold of Goryeo.

411
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,090
You can do it, can you not?

412
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,250
Your Highness.

413
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,960
Your Highness?

414
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,950
When did he put this thing here?

415
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,640
Are you asleep?

416
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,160
What are you going to do hiding here?

417
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:44,810
You should get going now.
Everyone must be worried about you.

418
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,590
I don't want to bother.

419
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:51,340
Don't hold on to what happened too much.

420
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,840
Everyone's just trying to
eat and survive.

421
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,850
They'll forget it soon.

422
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,950
I told you I don't want pity from you.

423
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,660
Do you know the reason
why you were born?

424
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,380
What?

425
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:09,430
How long do you have to
live in a world like this?

426
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,970
Have you tried to find out why?

427
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:12,570
Yes, I have.

428
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,040
I think about that these days.

429
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,490
You have?

430
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:27,290
But... there is no answer.

431
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:31,170
I wasn't born like this
because I wanted to be.

432
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,240
I'm the one who determines how I'll live.

433
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:39,480
I can live a very cool life
or I can live a sad one.

434
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,350
I just don't want to live
a life being controlled by others.

435
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,870
That's what I've decided.

436
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:51,240
No one in this world has an easy life.

437
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,810
You just don't notice them.

438
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,410
Everyone has a hard life.

439
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:04,410
They'll be starting
the rain ritual again soon.

440
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:08,300
What you went through just now will pass.

441
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:08,730
It's bothersome.

442
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:09,550
It will.
It's bothersome.

443
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:09,950
It will.

444
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:14,160
You are young, yet you pretend to
know everything about the world.

445
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,830
Gosh, why was I born?

446
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,200
Why would he ask me that
and make me stress about it?

447
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:08,180
That's it!

448
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,420
.

449
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:17,290
The rain ritual is today and the
Crown Prince is still not here.

450
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,180
Something very bad
must have happened to him.

451
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,520
Wait a little longer.

452
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:27,060
The people will not stay calm
if the rain ritual gets delayed.

453
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,340
I will go out of the palace
to find the Crown Prince.

454
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,100
Please do what you can to
appease the people, Your Highness.

455
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,710
I will not go.

456
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:40,170
I've had enough of standing
in front of the people.

457
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:43,370
The Crown Prince is only coming
to stand in your place.

458
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,980
You had no problem killing assassins.

459
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,750
You're going to fall into a depression
over a measly thing like that?

460
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,320
Measly thing?

461
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,900
You are too hung up on
the scar on your face.

462
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,280
You can't be a strength to the
Crown Prince if you can't overcome that.

463
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,180
You will never resolve the grudge
you have with your mother, as well.

464
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,390
So...

465
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,680
you used a ploy to choose me on purpose
and humiliate me?

466
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,710
Why?

467
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:13,850
You thought I would overcome it
if you put me in the worst situation?

468
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,090
Is that it?

469
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,420
So, you knew.

470
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,020
You need to be more confident.

471
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:30,040
That way the stones being thrown at you
will decrease in number.

472
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,930
And you've been hit
with those stones before?

473
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,100
"Heaven's will"?

474
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:40,120
You think I'm lacking intelligence
because I have this scar?

475
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:43,060
While my brothers were treated as princes

476
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,760
I was treated as less than
a butcher's son.

477
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,700
Now, I am the master of the ritual.

478
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,580
Unless you needed a slave
to sit there until it rained

479
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,770
there's no way I'd be chosen!

480
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,780
If it rains because of that "slave",
that slave will become like a king!

481
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,680
What of the way of the heavens?

482
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:02,310
You are definitely to stand tall
before all the people.

483
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,870
This is the only way the Crown Prince
can sit on the throne

484
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:07,640
and you can stand in a position
that is subject only to the king.

485
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,950
However, I can only lay the pieces.

486
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,530
I cannot force you to do this.

487
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,830
I understand.

488
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,250
I do.

489
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,520
Your will only takes you this far.

490
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:15,790
Come with me now.

491
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:17,260
I'm going to the rain ritual.

492
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,780
I have no time to go with you.

493
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:22,780
I can take that mask off for you.

494
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,340
What?

495
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:48,780
You...

496
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:53,210
It doesn't bother you
to see this ugly face?

497
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,190
Do you feel sorry for me?

498
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:01,720
How can I feel sorry for someone
who is always uttering death threats?

499
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,380
Whether you have a scar or not,

500
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,480
no matter how people see you,

501
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,820
the fact that you're a good person

502
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,350
is more important to me.

503
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:36,150
In the end, it's only a single hand-span.

504
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:40,310
Your having a long, dark life
because of this one hand-span...

505
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:42,870
doesn't that seem a bit unfair?

506
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,590
Can I really trust you?

507
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:59,420
I have always wondered and doubted.

508
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:09,170
In the past, I always trusted people
and was always betrayed by them.

509
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:13,910
That's when I learned

510
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:17,480
that it is difficult for someone to trust another.

511
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:22,690
Therefore, I intend not to change.

512
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,520
If you will trust me, Your Highness,

513
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,770
I will not change first.

514
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:29,850
I promise.

515
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:34,820
If it is you...

516
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,110
I can put myself in your hands.

517
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:44,350
Do whatever you want.

518
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:48,800
From now on...

519
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:51,970
I am yours.

520
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:31,320
Is the Crown Prince not here yet?

521
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:36,000
Please wait a little longer,
Your Majesty.

522
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:38,640
We cannot wait indefinitely.

523
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:43,390
If the time for the rain ritual passes,
what will happen after?

524
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:48,320
Your Majesty, why don't we appoint the
3rd Prince as the master of the ritual?

525
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:51,490
He is the oldest after the Crown Prince.

526
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:54,570
There is good reason and
there will be no grievances about it.

527
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:19,590
No matter what you do,
the Crown Prince won't be coming back.

528
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:23,390
What do you mean?

529
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:26,820
My brother has a tendency
to lose out on opportunities.

530
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:14,260
You can open your eyes now.

531
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:24,930
Seems like the rain ritual is starting soon.

532
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:40,050
Do you remember?

533
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:42,290
I said before, right?

534
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:44,060
You're mine.

535
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:47,730
Whether it was then

536
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:49,690
Or now

537
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:52,660
Or the moment you touched my face

538
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,400
I've made up my mind

539
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:00,070
I will make you mine.

540
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,140
Brace yourself from now on.

541
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:10,610
I will...

542
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,050
never let go of you.

543
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,780
What is this?

544
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,930
I came to take my seat.

545
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:44,930
Only the Crown Prince and I have
the right to sit in this palanquin.

546
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,770
You have a lot of guts for a beast.

547
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:10,760
You...

548
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:15,350
Please sit down.

549
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:17,010
Ji Mong!

550
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:20,090
The 4th Prince was chosen by the heavens.

551
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,680
Let's depart.

552
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:45,780
Please give us rain.

553
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,620
Let the rain fall.

554
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,240
Please rain!

555
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:51,980
Please give us rain!

556
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,200
It's the 4th Prince!

557
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,880
What? Is it you again?

558
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,900
It is. It's the 4th Prince again.

559
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,980
- Gosh!
- What are you doing here?

560
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,920
- I ought to just...
- Wait!

561
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:11,090
Look at him closely.

562
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:13,310
His face looks different.

563
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:16,890
The mask is gone.

564
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:20,170
Didn't they say he had scars all over his face?

565
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,950
Son of the dragon!

566
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,770
Please bring us rain.

567
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:29,490
Please rain! Bring us rain!

568
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:35,020
Please let it rain!

569
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:38,040
- Let it rain!
- Please give us rain.

570
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:43,010
Please let it rain.

571
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:53,810
Please rain!

572
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:52,990
What has happened?

573
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:55,760
Where is Yo?

574
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,320
Control yourself.

575
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,970
It is more important now
to complete the rain ritual.

576
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:53,690
It's raining!

577
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:57,290
It's raining! It's rain!

578
00:57:57,290 --> 00:58:00,060
The heavens have answered us.

579
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:02,650
It is finally raining.

580
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:05,490
It is raining!

581
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:10,580
It is finally raining!

582
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,870
