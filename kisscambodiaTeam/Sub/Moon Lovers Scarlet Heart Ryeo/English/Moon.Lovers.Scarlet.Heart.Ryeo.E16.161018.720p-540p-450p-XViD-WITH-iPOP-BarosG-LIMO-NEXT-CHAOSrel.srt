4
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,090
You should go now.

5
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,330
Be quiet.

6
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,850
I will be the one to protect you.

7
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,280
Yo, please let us go!

8
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,330
Please!

9
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:03,120
If you let us go,
we will never return to Goryeo again!

10
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,520
Think of our past bond
from growing up together.

11
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,620
Yo...

12
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,040
My wife.

13
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,610
Deok...

14
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,990
It's all right, Deok. It's all right.

15
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,920
Deok, it's all right.
Let's go together, okay?

16
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,990
Deok?

17
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,320
Deok!

18
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,950
Deok... no.

19
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,100
Deok, not yet.

20
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,830
Soon Deok.

21
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,050
Soon Deok.

22
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,740
Move.

23
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,640
Must you go this far?

24
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,200
The roots of treason must be pulled out
in order to keep the nation peaceful.

25
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,020
Move.

26
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,160
Stop!

27
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,350
Eun!

28
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,090
Do you remember back on my birthday?

29
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,380
You said you would give me
any present I wanted.

30
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,860
Do you recall that?

31
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,840
I was told there was a gift
only you could give to me.

32
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,080
He manipulated me.

33
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,390
That girl...

34
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,350
I cannot let her go alone.

35
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,850
So.

36
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,490
I would prefer it if you just...

37
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,930
It is a gift only you can give me.

38
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,920
No, you can't.

39
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:38,400
No! Eun, Eun.

40
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,800
Eun, Eun?

41
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,250
Eun?

42
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,500
Eun... wake up, would you?

43
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,560
Eun, open your eyes!

44
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,800
Eun.

45
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,900
Oh dear, were you waiting for me?

46
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:15,340
In all my time as a prince,
no girl has ever treated me this way.

47
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,660
I can't believe this happened.

48
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,750
What?

49
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,220
Your Highness, you are awesome.

50
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,120
There is the king, so how can I be?

51
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,000
Maybe I could be this.

52
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,470
Let go! Let me go. Let go.

53
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,130
First love, you say?

54
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,720
I once said to her.

55
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,970
The 13th Prince is handsome.

56
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:07,550
The 14th Prince is
talented in martial arts.

57
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,710
I told her to marry one of the two.

58
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,320
Yet, this girl insisted on
marrying the 10th Prince.

59
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,380
She said he was her first love.

60
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,320
If only I had known, I would have stopped her. 

61
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:34,790
I suppose she would have married him
even if she knew this would happen.

62
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,870
My Soon Deok was that kind of girl.

63
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,190
She is true to herself
and doesn't know how to change.

64
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,840
Let me ask you just one thing.

65
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,680
My Soon Deok...

66
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:04,940
Did my Soon Deok receive
lots of love from the prince?

67
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,480
A lot.

68
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,150
Very much.

69
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,170
They loved each other very, very much.

70
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,300
That's enough, then.

71
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,370
That's enough.

72
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,290
That's enough.

73
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,420
I'm sorry, Soon Deok.

74
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,760
Now, your father...

75
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,460
There was nothing more your father
could have done for you. 

76
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,540
Soon Deok.

77
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,750
I'll kill him.

78
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,300
Wang So... I'll kill him.

79
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,130
No... you can't.

80
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,680
I'll kill him.

81
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,000
Before he ends up killing everyone,
I'll kill him first!

82
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,410
He wanted it.

83
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,790
Prince Eun wanted it.

84
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,730
It isn't his fault.

85
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,410
He is having a hard time too.

86
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,280
Ji Mong.

87
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,290
It seems...

88
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,790
I must become a dog that kills.

89
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,790
A dog that bites its owner
and takes over its owner's home.

90
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,600
I will become a rabid wolf dog.

91
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:50,070
<i>I, Wang So, will become King of Goryeo.</i>

92
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,620
Eun is dead.

93
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,010
He and his wife both died.

94
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,230
With this, Wang Gyu's Revolt
is not a fabrication, but a fact.

95
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,850
Congratulations.

96
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,880
This should get all the powerful
families to act in their best interests.

97
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,230
We should hurry and
move the capital city to Seokyeong.

98
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,680
That will satisfy Uncle Wang Shik Ryeom.

99
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:34,180
They will not hold a funeral
since he has been labeled a traitor.

100
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,040
We are not to wear our mourning clothes.

101
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,680
They cannot be buried in
the royal family cemetery.

102
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:47,160
They were thrown outside the castle
into the forest to become crows' food.

103
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,760
We took care of it secretly
and buried them.

104
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,160
We could not get the
arrows out from Eun's body.

105
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,360
Jung broke off the arrows.

106
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,280
Eun...

107
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,510
still remembered that birthday.

108
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,890
Even I had completely forgotten about it.

109
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,840
He said it was a gift that
only I could give him.

110
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:28,500
Eun would be thankful for
what you did for him today.

111
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,340
Your Highness.

112
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,690
I just found the letter that
Court Lady Hae left for me.

113
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,170
She had told me that the
10th Prince was at the Damiwon.

114
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,920
Now I must look like
a monster in your eyes, too.

115
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,610
I did kill Eun.

116
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,510
It was a hard choice to make.

117
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,200
I know that.

118
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,420
Why did you hide the fact
that he was in the Damiwon?

119
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,300
You didn't trust me, did you?

120
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:10,140
You didn't say anything because
you worried that I might kill Eun.

121
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,470
Yes.

122
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,170
I did.

123
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,170
I was worried about the 10th Prince.

124
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,448
I was afraid of something happening that will cause great pain for you, too

125
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:27,860
that will cause great pain for you, too.

126
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,560
I thought avoiding the situation would be alright,

127
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,870
but I only realised too late

128
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,370
that it can hurt each other's feelings.

129
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,770
That is why I left that letter.

130
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,930
I trusted you.

131
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:54,000
It took some time, but I did come to trust you. 

132
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,370
I realized that my feelings for you

133
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,340
are enough to trust you no matter what.

134
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:09,330
But... now I don't feel that way.

135
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,390
When I look at you...

136
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,380
I will only remember what happened

137
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,220
because of the lack of trust
you had in me.

138
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,490
Eun died because of you.

139
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,160
I will remember how I had to kill him.

140
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,580
In order to save you...

141
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,530
I became the king's dog and my
feelings for you remained unchanged.

142
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,850
Now they have changed.

143
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,030
Let's stop now.

144
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,230
Lies.

145
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,350
You are lying.

146
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:07,050
We promised not to lie to each other.

147
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,660
4th Prince Wang So.

148
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:14,650
a favoured brother of mine, has executed the traitor Eun

149
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:17,470
and his wife Park Soon Deok.

150
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,355
Therefore, I grant him ten thousand lots of land near Songak

151
00:22:20,355 --> 00:22:23,410
for farming and building a house. 

152
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,910
Also, as the life energy of Songak has been depleted,

153
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,700
the capital will be moved to Seokyeong. 

154
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,530
He'll be the overseer of the construction there

155
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,740
as my trusted subject.

156
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,490
I will devote myself.

157
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,050
And repay you for
your confidence, Your Majesty.

158
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,110
After spilling all that blood...

159
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,890
are you not afraid?

160
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,390
It is difficult to sit on the throne
without spilling the blood of a few.

161
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,370
You should be careful.

162
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:01,340
There is only so much
I will let you get away with.

163
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,780
I will be traveling the borders and
will not be coming to the palace.

164
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,250
You do that.

165
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,890
However, think of Mother
and avoid the front lines.

166
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,880
Stay within the safety of your troops.

167
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,760
I have lived like a coward many times,
so I cannot do that.

168
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,370
I will see just how long
my lifeline really is.

169
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,790
I ought to pay for some of your crimes.

170
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,870
These are from Eun.

171
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,290
<i>Yo!</i>

172
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,300
<i>Please let us go.</i>

173
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,770
<i>Please! Yo!</i>

174
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:14,400
We'd better put out new sacrificial
food for the dead at the Gaeguksa.

175
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,200
You will be in charge of
building the new castle?

176
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,490
You've become very rich, too.

177
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,860
He got all of this for catching and
killing my daughter and son-in-law.

178
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,040
I hope you live a long, long time.

179
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:44,300
Is he even a human being?
It was his younger brother.

180
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,310
I hear you want to become king.

181
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,420
I plan on it.

182
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,200
That quack over there has been
saying it since long ago.

183
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,220
He says that he sees the star
of a king for you, Your Highness.

184
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:45,650
That is what your father,
the late King Taejo, said too.

185
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:48,010
So, he sent you to me.

186
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,430
That is why he wanted me to
teach you the martial arts.

187
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,180
It was because of that.

188
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,470
Star of a king?

189
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,140
I don't believe in those things.

190
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,050
Still, I have to become king.

191
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,080
If I have to be forced to kill
because of a seat...

192
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:10,280
I will become the owner of that seat
and put a stop to it.

193
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,740
Do you remember what
the late king said before?

194
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:23,120
For the sake of the nation
and the royal family...

195
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,800
the king must be willing
to throw everyone away.

196
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,350
It is a seat that makes you
throw everything away.

197
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,590
I remember.

198
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,190
Well, then...

199
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,830
who will you throw away?

200
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,180
I want to see that first.

201
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,660
Then I will decide.

202
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,270
So has already left for Seokyeong.

203
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,140
He won't return for a long time.

204
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,640
I will wait for you.

205
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,670
<i>[Jeongjong, third year
of reign (Year 948)]</i>

206
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:18,210
Court Lady! Court Lady!

207
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,930
I told you not to run.

208
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:23,070
You're an upper court lady now.
You should be dignified.

209
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,140
Get going now.

210
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,480
Someone you'll be happy to see is here!

211
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,480
Happy to see?

212
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,130
It's been two years since he's been here,
so you would be happy.

213
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,050
She told me not to run.

214
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,420
It's been a long time.

215
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,540
It has been a long time.

216
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,960
Sit down.

217
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:42,380
I came two days earlier on my own
so that I could drink this tea.

218
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,610
But then I saw Eun's cemetery.

219
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,990
I had to drop by.

220
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,210
I'm glad you did.

221
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,100
I showed off to my sister-in-law, too.

222
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,770
I did a lot more than she had ever done.

223
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:01,690
You are a grand general now.
It feels a little low of you.

224
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,360
I worried that you might have
left the palace while I was gone.

225
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,240
Where would I go?

226
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,170
What about marriage?
You're not getting married?

227
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,590
A girl from a good family can
leave the palace if she gets married.

228
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,400
Should I get married and live my life
taking care of someone?

229
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:22,770
I'm going to retire when I get older and
go on a vacation somewhere far away.

230
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:27,760
I will go to the deserts to ride camels
and go out to oceans far away.

231
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:33,200
I've saved up all my money
that I've made from working.

232
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,230
It's been a long time.

233
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,190
Wow! How long has it been?

234
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:50,200
- I heard you beat the Khitan in Hwayi.
- Well, yes.

235
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,240
My name is Woo Hee.

236
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,190
She is the highest court lady
of the Gyobang.

237
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,040
She has been coming by for tea and
refreshments for the Buddhist mass.

238
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,610
The highest court lady of the Gyobang?

239
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:07,330
Ah, that former gisaeng?

240
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:11,080
As always, you keep bad company.

241
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,560
A murderer and now a gisaeng.

242
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,510
Watch your mouth.

243
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,430
Be careful of that person.

244
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,770
He may stab you someday.

245
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:25,250
Also, would you please stop sending
that performer to the troops to spy?

246
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,350
A spy who plays the flute?
What is that?

247
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,590
I can't deal with you.

248
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:31,230
You must have suffered a lot
because you've become paranoid.

249
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,490
That guy... how did he know?

250
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,810
He sure is quick.

251
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:46,380
He may be a grand general,
but there is something cute about him.

252
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,550
Right? He is cute, isn't he?

253
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,280
You really sent someone?

254
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,260
I was curious to see
if he was doing all right.

255
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,800
What about So? Which room is he in?

256
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,720
The 4th Prince...

257
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:03,740
is here?

258
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,020
I assumed that he was here.

259
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,470
Yo.

260
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,440
Your Majesty.

261
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,480
Jung is back. Make your decision.

262
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,840
Kyung Chun Won Keun's mother
is from Hubaekje.

263
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,180
We cannot give Goryeo to
someone with Hubaekje blood.

264
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,880
Make Jung the Crown Prince.

265
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,890
You need to have someone
backing you, Your Majesty.

266
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:36,500
What do you see me as, Mother?

267
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,730
Am I a person or a pig?

268
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,690
You must not see me as a son...

269
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:48,940
but a boar that you sacrifice
in order to get the throne.

270
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,730
It is not as if I am going to die soon.

271
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:01,130
Yet, you've been nagging me for years.

272
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,600
Jung...

273
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,080
Does he want the throne?

274
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:22,870
<i>His Highness, the 4th Prince,
wishes to see Your Majesty.</i>

275
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:40,260
If you are so afraid,
I will make So the Crown Prince.

276
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:43,070
Jung or So, both are your sons.

277
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,270
What are you saying?

278
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,630
We will discuss this later.

279
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,330
Crazy...

280
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:02,470
You are useful in many ways.

281
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,480
What's so important
about a few dead slaves

282
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,340
that you would stop construction again?

283
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,480
The land in Songak is growing weaker.

284
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,940
The royal family line is in danger.

285
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,660
The priests and shamans
have all confirmed it.

286
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,760
We are lacking in manpower.

287
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,790
We do not have enough supplies
so people work one day and rest the next.

288
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:25,730
If you do not have enough manpower,
do not let them sleep.

289
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:28,540
If you are lacking supplies,
get them by stealing if you need to.

290
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:33,360
Squeeze, and squeeze,
and squeeze them out if you must!

291
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,030
Get it done on schedule.

292
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,480
I have committed a deadly sin,
Your Majesty.

293
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:01,090
Your Majesty,
let us talk more in private.

294
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,420
You're not asleep yet?

295
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:47,710
I don't think I've seen you get proper
sleep since I've been in the Damiwon.

296
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,180
I'll sleep soon.

297
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:57,360
Why is it that you write this so often?

298
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,900
You're illiterate, but you noticed.

299
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,240
I may be illiterate, but I can still see.

300
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,810
It looks the same.

301
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:13,910
I like the meaning.

302
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,480
"When the water has run dry,"

303
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,600
"Sit and watch for the rising clouds."

304
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,230
It was foolish of him to go on
until the water came to an end.

305
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,122
If you can't sleep, why don't you go for a walk?

306
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,975
You're leaving without seeing me?

307
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,751
It's been more than two years,
and you didn't come even once.

308
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,854
I guess you really have forgotten about me.

309
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,957
That's right.

310
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:06,093
I just came here by mistake today.

311
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:25,780
It's not over for me yet.

312
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,349
Just bear with me

313
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:29,951
since you left on your own without my consent.

314
00:39:30,718 --> 00:39:35,923
I deserve at least this much. 

315
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:49,470
Are you sleeping well?

316
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:53,007
Eating well?

317
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:58,010
Do you still...

318
00:40:00,047 --> 00:40:03,117
resent me?

319
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:47,820
Prince Wang So is scheming with some of the Songak clans

320
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,331
and is deliberately stalling the construction of the new capital.

321
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,467
He mixed gravel so the walls fell

322
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,903
and let some of the workers go.

323
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,239
Are you sure?

324
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:59,340
There are also rumors that

325
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,941
because Minister Wang Shik Ryeom is too ill, 

326
00:41:00,941 --> 00:41:05,179
supervision of the construction
isn't really happening.

327
00:41:05,179 --> 00:41:07,170
Why why why?!

328
00:41:10,317 --> 00:41:12,653
What is he after?

329
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:17,291
I'm sure it's more than just going against my will...

330
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:23,130
It's the throne...

331
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,932
Is he after the throne?

332
00:41:24,932 --> 00:41:26,467
Is that right?

333
00:41:26,467 --> 00:41:29,303
Before I answer that, let me ask you first.

334
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,773
Why did you break our deal?

335
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,408
Deal?

336
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:37,111
People who can't pay taxes
are drafted for forced labor.

337
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:38,813
Poor Later Baekje remnants

338
00:41:38,813 --> 00:41:41,382
are dragged to the construction
and are dying there.

339
00:41:42,016 --> 00:41:47,088
What's the point for me to keep serving

340
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,022
as your eyes and ears? 

341
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,760
So, you mean to quit?

342
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,699
If there's nothing in it for me.

343
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,648
Princess Woo Hee.

344
00:42:14,648 --> 00:42:18,252
You weren't addressed like this for a while now, right?

345
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,256
You know something about Baek Ah?

346
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:26,060
He's always been a very
sensitive and delicate soul.

347
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:31,098
People into arts are normally like that. 

348
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:39,140
I wonder what his face will look like

349
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:44,678
once he finds out you were my dog?

350
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,940
<i>I'm all right because I'm not alone.</i>

351
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:10,060
You are here, Your Highness.
Why am I alone?

352
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,280
Oh my!

353
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:19,270
You said you would ask for permission.

354
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:22,620
- Can I do it?
- No, you can't.

355
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:33,510
Next time, don't ever forget.

356
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:55,516
<i>Do you still...</i>

357
00:43:55,516 --> 00:43:59,553
<i>resent me?</i>

358
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,720
So is right over there.

359
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,330
Hae Soo is with him too.

360
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:33,180
Look at them.

361
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:36,660
I told you that you cannot trust that
he will live as your dog, Your Majesty.

362
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:43,330
He will be useful if
I pull on his collar just right.

363
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:47,150
"Those two no longer have feelings for
each other, so it won't be effective."

364
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:48,620
Do you believe that?

365
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:51,160
I did confirm that they didn't
send any letters to one another.

366
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,430
Still, you should confirm it.

367
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:58,350
Slaves only work hard if you give them
a good whipping now and then.

368
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:07,910
Stop.

369
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,550
It would have been better
not to see you at all.

370
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,580
Are you all right?

371
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:12,770
I felt like my arm was getting weak,
so I was testing myself.

372
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:15,190
Are you hurt?

373
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:16,420
It only grazed me.

374
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,240
Oh, you two are still on very good terms.

375
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:28,180
It would not look good if rumors started
that you killed a court lady for fun.

376
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:30,970
Yes, that would not be good.

377
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:34,200
It was my mistake.

378
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:40,330
You should be careful.

379
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:44,220
What did I do?

380
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:30,250
You asked to see me?

381
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:33,150
You can get a message to Baek Ah, right?

382
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,480
<i>He was on his way to Seokyeong.</i>

383
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,940
<i>His arm got worse,
so he's receiving treatment.</i>

384
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,940
<i>I have already sent everyone away,
so you don't need to worry.</i>

385
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:40,260
Why are you here?

386
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:43,240
I needed to ask you something.

387
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,850
I asked Baek Ah for this favor.

388
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:49,470
Ask me quickly and go back.

389
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:55,010
You still...

390
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:57,480
haven't forgotten me, have you?

391
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:03,400
You said you no longer liked me.

392
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,170
You were lying, weren't you?

393
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,820
Go back home.

394
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:18,120
This isn't the palace and
the king is not watching.

395
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,120
I wanted to ask you this.

396
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,440
I risked my life and left the palace.

397
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:27,020
There wasn't a day that
I wasn't waiting for two years.

398
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:30,050
I wanted to go back to that time.

399
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:34,960
I wished for it again and again.

400
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:36,920
So...

401
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,580
I wanted to tell you...

402
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,850
I trust you.

403
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,220
I will ask you again.

404
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:55,930
Answer me, and don't lie.

405
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:58,360
Answer me.

406
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:04,340
Do you...

407
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:07,530
still...

408
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:13,230
love me?

409
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,020
It's cute, right?

410
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,200
Come over here. Come over here.

411
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:52,130
That square thing over there
is called Pegasus.

412
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,910
Peg... what?

413
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:58,860
- Pegasus.
- Peg...

414
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,590
Pegasus.

415
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,420
The king is very ill.

416
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:20,960
<i>Envoys from East Jurchen were bringing tributes,</i>

417
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,870
<i>so I arranged for a day of dry thunder</i>

418
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:24,910
<i>to frighten the king,</i>

419
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:26,239
<i>I had no idea the envoy would be struck by lightning</i>

420
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:28,900
<i>and die right in front of him.</i>

421
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:30,677
<i>The royal physician says</i>

422
00:55:30,677 --> 00:55:34,481
<i>he was startled so much that he has become weak.</i>

423
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:40,921
<i>Help me get out, Yo!</i>

424
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:43,290
<i>Brother, please let us go!</i>

425
00:55:44,291 --> 00:55:48,795
<i>Think of our past bond
from growing up together.</i>

426
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:53,798
<i>Brother, please let us go!</i>

427
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:57,203
<i>We will never return to Goryeo again!</i>

428
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:19,424
<i>Yo.</i>

429
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,027
Your Majesty?

430
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:27,098
No...

431
00:56:27,701 --> 00:56:28,635
Don't... don't come to me. 

432
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:29,800
<i>Yo.</i>

433
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:34,074
Don't come near me! Don't! Don't! Don't!

434
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,220
Your Majesty!

435
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:54,427
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

436
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,894
Summon the court physician immediately!

437
00:57:04,204 --> 00:57:05,405
Get a horse ready.

438
00:57:05,405 --> 00:57:07,774
I'll go to Seokyung to see Lord Wang Shik Ryeom.

439
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,080
I think the time has come.

440
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:20,353
Princes Wook and Jung have left

441
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:22,353
while Grand General Park and the Shinju Kang clan are on standby

442
00:57:22,353 --> 00:57:24,650
controlling all the royal army and the clans.

443
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:26,350
You should make the decision.

444
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:42,570
Do you want the throne?

445
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:51,030
I want it.

446
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,100
The reason you left me...

447
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,670
was it because of the throne?

448
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:04,900
The king used you to get to me.

449
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:09,420
He will use me to continue bothering you.

450
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:15,120
What if I asked you to give it up?

451
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:24,240
I will persuade you until
you say it is all right to do it.

452
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:33,040
You said you didn't need to be king
as long as we were together.

453
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:37,050
You're not saying it anymore.

454
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:41,510
We agreed not to lie to each other.

455
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:48,810
I started this so that I could stop us
brothers from having to kill each other.

456
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:51,350
But...

457
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:54,750
when I was building the castle...

458
00:58:56,370 --> 00:59:00,260
I realized that the world
can change if the king changes.

459
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:07,850
I won't be controlled by anyone.

460
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,980
And I can get rid of all this absurdity.

461
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:13,760
Being king...

462
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,480
is something I definitely want.
