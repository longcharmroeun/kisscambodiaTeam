<i>[This drama has taken
a creative license to history.]</i>

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,320
Let Soo go now!

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,490
Wolves are known to follow
one female wolf until death.

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,780
You are an animal, after all.

6
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,920
Won!

7
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,250
Make a choice.

8
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,300
Is it Hae Soo?

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,690
Or the dead king?

10
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,590
Greetings to the new king, Your Majesty.

11
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,640
Long, long...

12
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,530
Long live the king.

13
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,510
<i>[Episode 15]</i>

14
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,970
Ji Mong.

15
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:21,500
Queen Yoo said to me that I must be
so happy that Tae died.

16
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,220
When in actuality, I miss 2nd brother very much.

17
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,770
<i>[Choi Ji Mong, Wang So, Crown Prince Moo]</i>

18
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,110
Rather than someone like me
with such lowly in-laws

19
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,780
it would've been better if
Tae had became Crown Prince.

20
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,290
I told you not to say such things.

21
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,280
I told you that you have the star of a
king in the Heonwon constellation.

22
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,510
Really?

23
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,810
Yes.

24
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,110
But...

25
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,610
Well, Moo.

26
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,630
Well, what if...

27
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,930
you did not have a long life?

28
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,290
What would you do?

29
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,530
Who cares if it is not long?

30
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,970
It is more important who I
spend my last days with.

31
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:24,370
Moo, I would like to become a king too.

32
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,990
Yes, and of course you will.

33
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,540
Your Highness Wang So
has the star of a king as well.

34
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,150
Really, Ji Mong?

35
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,360
Then I will become king too?

36
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,690
Yeah! I'm going to become king!

37
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,830
You should refer to me as "Your Majesty."

38
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,790
Yes, Your Majesty.
Forgive us, Your Majesty.

39
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,590
He is a king.

40
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,880
He is...

41
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,270
the king of our nation, Goryeo.

42
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,030
Are you going to leave him
here in tatters like this?

43
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,720
Moo.

44
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,460
Forget everything.

45
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,320
Rest in peace.

46
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,140
Please get up.

47
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,300
All of this happened...

48
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,000
because of me.

49
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,250
I am sorry.

50
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,150
So...

51
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,800
Where are you going, So?

52
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,130
Get out of my way.

53
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,320
The new king would like me
to let you know.

54
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,250
If Hae Soo is to leave
the Damiwon or disappear

55
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,790
an announcement will be made to all of
Goryeo that she poisoned the late king.

56
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,360
She won't be able to get far.

57
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,200
<i>[10th Prince Eun's Residence]</i>

58
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,190
<i>[Wang Gyu - 10th Prince's Grandfather]</i>
You scoundrels!

59
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,070
We have caught Wang Gyu,
but the 10th Prince is already gone.

60
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,700
<i>[Wang Shik Ryeom]</i>

61
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,790
We must catch him.

62
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,020
Go and find him. Now!

63
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

64
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,750
Let me go. Let me go, you scoundrels!

65
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,890
How could the king do this to me?

66
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,540
Please let me see the king!

67
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,300
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

68
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,500
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

69
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,430
Park Sool Hee will be exiled.

70
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,380
We will say that Wang Gyu plotted treason
and even killed Park Sool Hee.

71
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,640
Good work.

72
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,820
Good job on what you did with Moo.

73
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,960
Also, the advice you gave me to use
Hae Soo to get to So was good too.

74
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,020
I am relieved that you are on my side.

75
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:21,640
Without you on my side, Uncle,
Wook would not work for me.

76
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,330
Shouldn't you kneel to the king?

77
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,760
Greetings to you, Your Majesty.

78
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,500
Long live the king.

79
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,300
Eun and his wife have escaped.

80
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,760
In order to make Wang Gyu's revolt real,
you must catch Eun quickly.

81
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,830
We have to kill him.

82
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,170
Do not worry.

83
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:46,050
You do have a dog talented in
catching royal family members.

84
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,650
What about my grandson?

85
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:04,950
Please let my Eun live!

86
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,110
I knew a day like this would come.

87
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:26,490
You were a perfect child
ever since you were born.

88
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,080
I foresaw that you would
bring me great glory.

89
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,580
Your Majesty.

90
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,070
<i>[3rd Monarch - Jeongjong]</i>
Congratulations on becoming Queen Mother.

91
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,730
Take care of the other princes
as soon as possible.

92
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,520
That is the only way
to make the palace stable.

93
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,460
- Also--
- I will take care of the politics.

94
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,640
Goryeo is ours now.

95
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,360
You should live enjoying the
fine and beautiful things life offers.

96
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,680
Yo...

97
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:58,810
Come on up.

98
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,890
Have some manners in front of the king.

99
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,790
Do not be so heartless.

100
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:16,420
I am alive thanks to him.

101
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,780
You... held back when you stabbed me.

102
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,260
In that last moment,
you let consideration get in the way.

103
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:43,160
If you feel regretful about that moment,
I can put you away for good now.

104
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,310
You!

105
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,970
Wang Gyu was trying to get the
10th Prince Eun on the throne.

106
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,460
He was put to death.

107
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,230
Go catch the prince.

108
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,440
If you do find him,
you can kill him on the spot.

109
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,610
Was the late king not enough for you?

110
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,060
I cannot do that.

111
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,470
You can't?

112
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,620
You will have to do it.

113
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:19,120
That way, Baek Ah and Choi Ji Mong...

114
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,450
Even Hae Soo...

115
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,710
All of those who you
consider to be your people...

116
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,460
will stay safe.

117
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:36,180
You're already a dog that
goes after your siblings anyway.

118
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:56,040
I told you not to keep him close.
Get rid of him!

119
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,220
It's very amusing to tame him, so why?

120
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,500
He thinks he can pity me?

121
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,460
He was being considerate of me?

122
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,230
What arrogance...

123
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:33,280
Wang Gyu and his family
have been executed.

124
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:42,280
The king has ordered me
to find Eun and his wife.

125
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,890
He wouldn't kill them, would he?

126
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,680
Listen to me carefully, Your Highness.

127
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,730
I have a bond with King Taejo
from our days in the battleground

128
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,530
when we founded Goryeo.

129
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:13,530
We fought to the death,
so I have been loyal up to now.

130
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,800
But this is not right.

131
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,450
Do not harm my daughter.

132
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,110
If my daughter gets caught up
in a fight among the Wangs...

133
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,010
I, Park Soo Kyung, will not sit idly by.

134
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,180
I'm alright.

135
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,748
How about you?

136
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,450
Nothing has happened, right?

137
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:58,554
It is true that the late king
died from mercury poisoning.

138
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:03,592
Since we don't know who was behind it,
we can't trust anyone.

139
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,168
I'll be away from the palace for a while.

140
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,515
It worries me that you'll be alone.

141
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,275
Stay away from the king or the
queen mother as much as possible,

142
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:23,045
and if anything happens,
go straight to Choi Ji Mong.

143
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,410
Where are you going?

144
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:33,890
The king has ordered me to arrest some traitors.

145
00:14:33,989 --> 00:14:36,580
Did he blackmail you with my life again?

146
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,598
Just leave the matter to me.

147
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,900
You and I are the only ones
who attended to the king.

148
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,690
Whether it was getting the bath water
or preparing the herbal medicine.

149
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,680
No one else touched it.

150
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,180
So how could there be mercury?

151
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,520
It wasn't me.

152
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,540
I'm telling the truth.

153
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,150
Did you think that I would suspect you?

154
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,870
You need to be careful too.

155
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,380
The 3rd Prince has
always been a scary person.

156
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,690
The 10th Prince's family
has been accused of treason.

157
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,230
His mother and relatives...

158
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,140
they have all been executed.

159
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,210
What?

160
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,070
What about the prince?
What happened to him?

161
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:40,340
<i>I'll be away from the palace for a while.
It worries me that you'll be alone.</i>

162
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,010
<i>Where are you going?</i>

163
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,890
<i>The king has ordered me to arrest some traitors.</i>

164
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,860
Then the person the 4th Prince
needs to catch is...

165
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,470
Lady Hae? Lady?

166
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,320
Soo, it's me.

167
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,290
The new king won't be able to
figure out we are hiding here.

168
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,190
His Highness says that we can trust you.

169
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,400
But don't get any other ideas.

170
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,050
You're dead if you do.

171
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,710
Stop it, already.

172
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,120
Anyway, don't worry too much, Soo.

173
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,880
We have a boat,
so we'll be here until it leaves.

174
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,730
Where will you be going?

175
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,630
- We'll--
- That's enough.

176
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,540
You don't need to know that.
Just make sure we do not get caught.

177
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,180
Don't tell anyone about us.

178
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:16,100
Yes, I'll make sure to be very careful.

179
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,070
But wouldn't it be better
to get help from my brothers?

180
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,470
Yeah, like from Wook.

181
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,190
What about Baek Ah or Jung?

182
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,730
There's no way they wouldn't help me.

183
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,980
- Even So was there on my birthday--
- No!

184
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,860
Because...

185
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:44,790
the 4th Prince is currently
looking for the two of you.

186
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,780
We can't tell anyone.

187
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,220
We don't know how things can leak out.

188
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,400
If we make one wrong move,
it is all over.

189
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,290
All right, I got it.

190
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,300
By the way, Soo...

191
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:05,220
What happened to my mother and aunt?

192
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,040
I'm not sure.

193
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,920
I don't know much about
what's going on outside the Damiwon.

194
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,980
I'm bothered by the fact that
I couldn't bring them with me.

195
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,940
I hope they managed to get away.

196
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,680
I thought you were merely a gisaeng
who wanted revenge for your parents.

197
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,140
You were a representative
for Later Baekje.

198
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,920
You hid a lot from me.

199
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,530
I thought it may be used
against you, Your Majesty.

200
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:49,670
Please allow the people of Later Baekje
to access the southern territories.
I thought it may be used
against you, Your Majesty.

201
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,250
Please allow the people of Later Baekje
to access the southern territories.

202
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,540
Allow them to farm the land for
three years without paying taxes.

203
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,020
Please emancipate those
who were taken forcefully as slaves.

204
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,010
Restore law-abiding citizens
back to their status.

205
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:04,000
Allow them to farm the land.

206
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,340
You were someone
who tried to kill the king.

207
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,370
Why would I trust you and make a deal?

208
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,480
My people are starving to death.

209
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,440
Revenge means nothing to me.

210
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,920
If you guarantee their survival

211
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,820
the people of Later Baekje
will accept you as their king.

212
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,570
They will be loyal to you.

213
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,610
Yes.

214
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:40,180
No matter how much I think about it

215
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,520
I feel like I would be losing out.

216
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,430
I have a good offer.

217
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:02,120
I heard that the 4th Prince,
that dog, is out to kill his brother.

218
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,490
Be quiet! You'll get yourself in trouble.

219
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:11,230
It doesn't make sense that the playful,
carefree 10th Prince would plot treason.

220
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:14,540
The 4th Prince is acting
like the king's dog.

221
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,700
It's probably all made up.
You should know something.

222
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,230
Just eat up.

223
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:26,250
I found the boat.
It leaves in five days.

224
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,540
- Where is it headed?
- That's the thing...

225
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:34,240
There are four different boats leaving
at the same time on the same day.

226
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,240
I don't know which one they will take.

227
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:44,310
You aren't really going to catch Eun
and take him in, are you?

228
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,810
You do not trust me either, do you?

229
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,780
I do not trust our third brother.

230
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,900
A person who manipulates people and
uses their weaknesses has become king.

231
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,560
The future looks bleak.

232
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,210
Find out if Eun has
reached out to anyone.

233
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,690
Like Jung, for example.

234
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,050
Perhaps because Wook
has a history with our 3rd brother

235
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,000
they say he has not made a move at all.

236
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:12,490
Who could have guessed
he would have come back alive?

237
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,670
Woo Hee.

238
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,400
It has been a long time.

239
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,670
Yes, Baek Ah told me you had returned.

240
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,150
Hae Soo will be happy to see you.

241
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,440
I will probably see her soon.

242
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,240
I will be going back to the Gyobang.

243
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,490
Gyobang?

244
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,750
You didn't say that before.

245
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,850
How long can I depend on you for support?

246
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:46,690
I won't be a gisaeng.
I'm just going to teach dance.

247
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:47,880
Don't worry too much.

248
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,090
It's very late. Where are you off to?

249
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,840
You are awfully interested in me.

250
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,040
I get the feeling that it is you
who is behind all of this.

251
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,460
So I wondered if you
were visiting him again.

252
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,380
What would make you think such a thing?

253
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:26,450
The late king had been addicted
to mercury for at least two years.

254
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:30,350
The 9th Prince Won seemed
to be the most likely suspect.

255
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,650
However, it was too detailed
and well-planned.

256
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,650
It doesn't fit Won's personality.

257
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,860
But maybe if it were you...

258
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,080
It's also strange that
the king is leaving you alone.

259
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,080
A man like that would have
gotten rid of you already.

260
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:54,210
You got rid of the 10th Prince's family

261
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,030
and one of Songak's
most powerful families.

262
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:03,280
Aside from a smart person like you,
I have to wonder who else could do it.

263
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,740
You have always been suspicious of me.

264
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,080
Did you...

265
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,110
really cause our brother's death?

266
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,690
How about you?

267
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:30,300
Are you going to become
the king's dog and kill Eun?

268
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,670
We are both struggling to survive.

269
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,770
That is the fate of a prince
who does not become a king.

270
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,580
In order to protect, you must submit.

271
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,000
I don't know what made you
change so much.

272
00:23:56,050 --> 00:24:01,680
I... did not poison the late king.

273
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,050
Does that answer your question?

274
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,290
Why did you put mercury
in the king's bath water?

275
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,160
I never did such a thing.

276
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,980
Would you say the same thing
after being tortured?

277
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:53,750
If so...

278
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,850
I would say you told me to do it,
Your Majesty.

279
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:01,270
I would say that you ordered me to do it
because you wanted the throne.

280
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,080
I will say that even if I die.

281
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,620
You are quite something, aren't you?

282
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:12,300
I suppose you were always
this way since you were young.

283
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,620
It is amusing.

284
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,330
I will not get rid of you.

285
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,580
You are the best bait I can use
to control my brothers.

286
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,920
Then...

287
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,030
please tell me who really
put mercury in the water.

288
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:33,970
You believe that I know who did it?

289
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,500
Even if I know who did it,
I cannot breathe a word about it.

290
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,040
If you say that I committed regicide,
that is the end for me.

291
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,370
So, I would like to know.

292
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,470
Who was it?

293
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,520
<i>Your Majesty, His Highness
the 8th Prince is here to see you.</i>

294
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,080
How is it that he showed up
right on time?

295
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,720
Pardon?

296
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,130
Greetings, Your Majesty.

297
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,640
I had a question to ask you,
so it's a good thing you are here.

298
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,790
Hae Soo is dying of curiosity.

299
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,060
Who was it that put mercury
in the late king's bath water?

300
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,370
I believe the late king
died of an illness.

301
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,820
Is that not true?

302
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,850
Yes, that's true.

303
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,540
He passed away from an illness.

304
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,430
I heard that you witnessed
what happened to the late king.

305
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,080
It must have been shocking.

306
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,740
He was like an
older brother to me, as well.

307
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,420
The person who made him
die so tragically...

308
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,490
who could it be?

309
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,770
Your Highness...

310
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,240
you are not connected to it, are you?

311
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,960
I did not raise my son to be a traitor.

312
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,530
You have let me down.

313
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:08,800
I had to commit treason in order to
protect you and our family.

314
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,870
Is this because of Hae Soo?

315
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:16,600
I'm asking you if Hae Soo had anything
to do with the decisions that you made.

316
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:26,050
Yes. I did consider her.

317
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,980
It is because of her.

318
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:33,720
Soo says...

319
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:38,680
I tried to have everything
and that was wrong, but why?

320
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,530
I tried to protect
my family and my heart.

321
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:46,670
What's so wrong with that?

322
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,540
Mother, you told me to live right
and I lived my life that way.

323
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,340
So why am I still lonely?

324
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,656
Wook...

325
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,050
I have already started down this path.

326
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,310
I will live this way and
achieve what I want.

327
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,810
I won't be foolish and lose what I want.

328
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,420
I have done nothing wrong.

329
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,770
Soo!

330
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,780
I heard the king called you in

331
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,540
so I thought something
had happened to you.

332
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,630
It does not seem like he intends
to kill me or kick me out.

333
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,510
He plans to use you as bait
to manipulate me.

334
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:08,890
It's fine.

335
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:13,470
Even so, I prefer you being safe.

336
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:18,210
About what you said before...

337
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:21,250
what happened to the people
you were looking for?

338
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,560
To tell you the truth...

339
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,030
I am looking for Eun.

340
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:37,230
The king wants to find him and kill him.

341
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,090
But I need to do whatever
I can to help him escape.

342
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,890
Yes.

343
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,770
Don't worry. I will find him.

344
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,340
Ji Mong!

345
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:16,490
The 10th Prince's binary star
has risen near the palace.

346
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:19,080
You should try looking again.

347
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,670
I've looked everywhere.

348
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,050
I went to the Damiwon
and Eun was not there.

349
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,450
That can't be.

350
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,110
How much can I trust you
at times like this?

351
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,880
Did you know that Moo
would die in that way?

352
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,850
Did you know that my 3rd brother
would become the king?

353
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,480
Can you imagine what it is like for me
to know and not get involved?

354
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,750
It is the divine punishment for
those who read the heavens.

355
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,000
However, even I was
surprised by the 3rd Prince.

356
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,220
He was only born with the star
of one who would commit treason.

357
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:59,680
Something has definitely changed.

358
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,930
Something has deviated.

359
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:06,200
What has changed to make
the 3rd Prince become king?

360
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,830
I am curious.

361
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,280
Be careful of the 4th Prince.

362
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,300
The 4th Prince...

363
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,260
Be careful of Wang So.

364
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,830
Wook?

365
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,110
That is what Hae Soo said to me.

366
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,810
Be careful of the 4th Prince.

367
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,440
She said I should not try to stop him.

368
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,320
It's just as she said.

369
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,440
He's taking everything.

370
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,320
No matter what I do...

371
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,280
everything will become his.

372
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,490
Why is that?

373
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,090
What should I do?

374
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,010
Where is Court Lady Hae?

375
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,190
Sorry, I do not know.

376
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,600
You there.

377
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,190
Do you know where Court Lady Hae is?

378
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,510
Stop right there.

379
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,390
Why do you have such poor manners?

380
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,760
I apologize, Your Highness.

381
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:55,870
Sister-in-law.

382
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,260
It is you, right?

383
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:02,570
It is you.

384
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,940
We have to leave the palace
to get on the boat.

385
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:14,390
Are you playing here?
There are no other doors.

386
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:17,130
North, south, west, or east.
There are no easy exits.

387
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:20,070
There are more guards now
than when we entered.

388
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:24,380
After usurping the throne,
Yo is afraid he may get hit someday.

389
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,300
I am ashamed that he is my brother.

390
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,910
I wish we had Ji Mong's
flying contraption.

391
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:34,040
Or maybe a hole in the ground...

392
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,550
A cave? There is one.

393
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,010
There is a way out!

394
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,150
Soo!

395
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:10,970
I would like to say goodbye to my father.

396
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:14,520
Don't you think I could reach him
through Choi Ji Mong?

397
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,880
That is dangerous.

398
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,550
The astronomer is also
close to the 4th Prince.

399
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,350
I thought this earlier.

400
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:27,410
How come you don't trust the 4th Prince?

401
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,080
You have a special relationship.

402
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,510
I have my reasons.

403
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:37,550
If you're doing so because of us,
then I am thankful.

404
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,770
Still, I think it's a bit wrong.

405
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,370
I know there are some bad rumors
about the 4th Prince.

406
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:47,110
He wouldn't go around
catching people for no reason.

407
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,260
Unless you experienced
something bad yourself...

408
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,030
shouldn't you trust
the person that you like?

409
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:55,810
<i>Do not get so hung up on the future
that you lose what you have now.</i>

410
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:57,030
You are right.

411
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,880
You are right, my lady.

412
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,210
I was being foolish.
I never had any first-hand experience.

413
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,780
I will visit the astronomer.

414
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:24,196
Astronomer?

415
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,370
Astronomer?

416
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,510
Why do you carry around a hairpin?

417
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,410
Just because.

418
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,960
You have to give it back to me.

419
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,510
By the looks of it, it's not new.

420
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:45,530
Does it belong to a girl you love?

421
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:51,450
I thought all you cared
about was fighting.

422
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,010
I am curious about who she is.

423
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:06,040
She is someone who put
her life on the line for me.

424
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,460
She put her whole body on the line
in order to save me.

425
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,910
<i>Hey! Back off, back off!</i>

426
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:19,570
<i>Get back! You're dead
if you come any closer.</i>

427
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:22,000
<i>Get back, you scoundrels! Get back!</i>

428
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:26,650
<i>In the stillness of the day and wind.</i>

429
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:33,950
<i>Because I like the sunshine, I smile.</i>

430
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,940
At first, it was when I saw her sing.

431
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:42,990
That was when I knew.

432
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,120
Someday, I wanted her
to sing only for me.

433
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,270
I started to wish for that.

434
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,980
Are those feelings...

435
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,200
what it means to like someone?

436
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,120
I am certain of it.

437
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,500
I have been through it, so I know.

438
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:07,880
You have?

439
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,350
<i>When my older sister was chosen
to become the king's wife</i>

440
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:25,710
<i>all the girls in the powerful families
gathered to play together.</i>

441
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:30,060
<i>Even back then, I was much more
comfortable in my armor.</i>

442
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:34,030
<i>To the other children,
I was like a different species.</i>

443
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,710
I'd prefer being on the battleground.

444
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,190
Don't cry.

445
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:49,090
Don't you like this flower ring?

446
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,570
That's strange.

447
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:00,670
All pretty girls seem to
like flower rings.

448
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,830
You will like it too, right?

449
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,150
If you truly like someone,
you will never be confused about it.

450
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,460
Do not be worried about it and go for it.

451
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,880
I will cheer you on.

452
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:24,640
My first love came true.

453
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,900
Since I will be cheering you on

454
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,510
I know yours will come true,
Your Highness.

455
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,740
Go get it!

456
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,850
Greetings to you, Your Majesty.

457
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,900
I am sorry to come so late.

458
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,080
Congratulations on becoming king.

459
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,390
I was going to call you in soon.

460
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,590
I had news regarding your marriage.

461
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,940
I will send you to Khitan.

462
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,820
What?

463
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,580
The late king had promised them
Princess Kyung Hwa

464
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,930
and then married her off to So.

465
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,000
Therefore, I have agreed to send
a royal who is just as high in status.

466
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,260
Congratulations on
your marriage, Yeon Hwa.

467
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:46,290
Why is it that everyone in that seat
threatens me with marriage?

468
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:49,900
Whether it be the person who conceived
me or the person I grew up with.

469
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,880
You are all the same.

470
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,200
You must believe there is no better way
to control a woman than marriage.

471
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,910
I am disappointed in you.

472
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:04,080
You're not still greedy to
be a queen, are you?

473
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:09,210
Your brother betrayed me
and you were on his side.

474
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,440
I cannot...

475
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,020
have a household like that as in-laws.

476
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,770
<i>Also, I have someone else I want.</i>

477
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:46,590
<i>Without Soo...</i>

478
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:50,040
<i>I would not even have a future.</i>

479
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:55,120
<i>I am nothing without her.</i>

480
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:40,770
It is so stuffy in here.

481
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:43,490
I've been running around
this palace since I was a boy.

482
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:46,070
Is there nowhere I can go
besides this one room?

483
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,760
At least you can go out.

484
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,310
It has been days for me.

485
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,640
Would you like to take a bath?

486
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:01,130
Hae Soo does not allow the court ladies
in at night, so it will be all right.

487
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:48,280
What do you think?

488
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,320
Wow! That is amazing.

489
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,530
It looks like the real thing.

490
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,940
Well, I'll have to
show you all my skills.

491
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,410
All right, start!

492
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,130
Yes! I won!

493
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:53,310
See that? I won again.

494
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,110
Put your arm out.

495
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,280
My hand hurts from hitting you too much.

496
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,400
Why does it hurt so much?

497
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:27,640
Oh yeah.

498
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:32,500
I was going to give this
to you and I forgot.

499
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:35,900
You...

500
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,710
remembered to bring this
in all that confusion?

501
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:43,390
It's your favorite thing.

502
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,070
Your slingshot.

503
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,000
What prince?

504
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:10,880
I would have wanted to open the
largest novelty goods shop in Songak.

505
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,710
That was my dream.

506
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:14,620
You can do that.

507
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:19,020
We can go to Tamra and you should
open a novelty goods shop, Your Highness.

508
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,090
I will teach martial arts.

509
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:22,800
Should we?

510
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,320
I did manage to bring this one thing.

511
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:52,110
Yes.

512
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:56,440
I'm sure Hae Soo will like it.

513
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,770
It's yours.

514
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,810
Yeon Hwa was asking what kind of girl
doesn't even have an incense pouch.

515
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,770
Why are you embarrassing your husband?

516
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:18,010
Do you not like it?

517
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,790
That's strange.

518
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:25,210
They say all pretty girls like it.

519
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:28,520
That's strange.

520
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:31,750
All pretty girls seem to
like flower rings.

521
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:38,340
I'm not saying that you're pretty.

522
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:42,660
Just that... lately...

523
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,910
you don't look so bad.

524
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,810
I have some eye issues.

525
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:03,350
I understand what you are saying.

526
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:07,180
Even flowers from a pumpkin...

527
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,450
are still flowers.

528
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:19,720
I want two sons and two daughters.

529
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:21,820
I won't have it any other way.

530
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:26,870
Will kissing make me pregnant?

531
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:40,460
It would have been nice to
live like this from the beginning.

532
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:47,390
Let's head inside.

533
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:51,390
You'll freeze to death
before the king catches us.

534
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:56,040
Wait! Am I with child right now?

535
00:49:58,790 --> 00:49:59,990
Here.

536
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:09,680
My lady, there must have been a ghost.

537
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,110
I am certain that
I cleaned up before sleeping.

538
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,430
Did someone come by?

539
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:22,170
I made them.

540
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,770
I thought I might decorate
the Damiwon with them.

541
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:28,710
I see.

542
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:32,220
How did he make this?

543
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:52,660
Hello.

544
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:54,810
I will get the attendants
ready to serve you.

545
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:56,640
I came to talk to you.

546
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:03,180
Yes.

547
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:05,630
Then this way, please.

548
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:31,340
Leave So.

549
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:35,540
I know what you did with Wook.

550
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:39,350
I know you haven't told So
and now he's bewitched by you.

551
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:44,410
I cannot bear to see this indecent
behavior anymore, so leave him first.

552
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:48,440
Then I won't cause a problem either.

553
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,540
Your goal in getting married
is to leave the palace.

554
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,340
I will do that for you.

555
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,850
I can get you married into a family

556
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:59,100
that's on a similar level
to that of a prince.

557
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,410
Marriage might be a goal for you,
Your Highness, but not for me.

558
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,470
He is happy because of me.

559
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:12,630
He makes me feel valued
and that is why I want to marry.

560
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:18,390
If he remains steadfast...

561
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:21,340
there is no reason for me to change.

562
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,750
I will not leave him first.

563
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:29,680
Now I know why I have always hated you.

564
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,930
For you, feelings and marriage...

565
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,710
are all just silly games.

566
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:39,010
They aren't life and death
like they are for me.

567
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,750
Don't be so confident
that you will not change.

568
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:52,730
No one says such things in the palace.

569
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,600
You will have many regrets.

570
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:01,790
I promise you I will
make you regret this.

571
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,810
Grand General Park Soo Kyung
and Astronomer Choi Ji Mong.

572
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:43,920
Those with military and religious power
are sticking by 4th Prince Wang So.

573
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,020
You must get rid of the 4th Prince
as soon as possible.

574
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:52,160
It hasn't been long since
we planned Wang Gyu's revolt.

575
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:54,870
Also, So is a brother who
shared the same womb as me.

576
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:59,100
Even when I attack him,
the timing must be right.

577
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:04,770
Then you must separate
Park Soo Kyung and Choi Ji Mong.

578
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,510
What is this?

579
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:36,330
I wish to make things a
little easier for the two of you.

580
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,850
- What?
- In return...

581
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:44,120
if my plan works out,
cancel my marriage to Khitan.

582
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,972
I was told that you know where Eun is.

583
00:55:58,972 --> 00:56:01,174
Where is he?

584
00:56:01,174 --> 00:56:05,045
Damiwon Court Lady Hae Soo has been
hiding Eun and his wife in Damiwon.

585
00:56:05,045 --> 00:56:06,680
How do you know?

586
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,680
Did you see it yourself?

587
00:56:09,082 --> 00:56:12,986
Eun has had a knack for folding things
out of towels since he was little.

588
00:56:12,986 --> 00:56:15,221
Puppies, birds...

589
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,958
He'd also use paper to make boats.

590
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:22,362
Damiwon was full of such little toys Eun made.

591
00:56:22,362 --> 00:56:24,497
I'm positive.

592
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:41,890
If you follow this path out to the cave,
Jung will be waiting outside.

593
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:45,190
He will help you get safely to the boat.

594
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:48,950
It's some dried meat.

595
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:51,110
Just in case.

596
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:55,660
Thank you...

597
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,630
very much.

598
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:05,670
Soo. I'll see you when I come back.

599
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:08,610
Yes, I'll be waiting for you.

600
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:11,250
By the way, what about my father?

601
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:14,300
I left a letter.
I'm sure he will meet you on the way.

602
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,630
Let's go.

603
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,550
Run! There are royal guards
everywhere outside.

604
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:38,120
- Jung.
- I will stop them, so run!

605
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,180
You too!

606
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,150
<i>We are here for the 10th Prince.
Find him now!</i>

607
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:59,230
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

608
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,430
Take the prince another way.

609
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:15,840
What?

610
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:18,970
They won't be able to kill me
because of my father.

611
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:20,980
They are after you, Your Highness.

612
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,410
No, you can't.

613
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:24,690
Let's go together.

614
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,990
I will follow you soon.

615
00:58:35,330 --> 00:58:36,610
I promise you.

616
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:40,590
I'm trusting you.

617
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:55,640
Listen to your wife and run,
Your Highness.

618
00:58:56,770 --> 00:59:00,540
I can't do it. I can't hide
behind my wife in shame like this.

619
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:02,610
Your Highness!

620
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:09,660
What can I do?

621
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:12,400
I am her awesome person now.

622
00:59:16,169 --> 00:59:19,059
I am all she has.
