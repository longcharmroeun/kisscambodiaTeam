4
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,660
Mister.

5
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,860
Have you ever wanted to sleep
for a hundred or a thousand years?

6
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,330
Everything keeps going wrong

7
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,820
and you don't see any
hope of it getting better.

8
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,060
You tell yourself,
"I'm sure things will get better."

9
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,560
Then another thing goes wrong.

10
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,310
I would just prefer...

11
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,880
to fall asleep and never wake up again.

12
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,330
I want to forget everything.

13
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,090
But it's not working.

14
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,330
That jerk who left me
with a pile of debt.

15
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,370
That wench who fooled me
and ran off with him.

16
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,450
Gosh...

17
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,360
I should never have trusted anyone.

18
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,370
Mister, you know what?

19
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,660
I thought that if I didn't change

20
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,630
the people I trusted and liked
wouldn't change either.

21
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,310
I was wrong, though.

22
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,630
How did my life end up this way?

23
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,570
Your life can't change
just because you want it to.

24
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,280
Maybe if you died and
came back to life again.

25
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,470
What?

26
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,630
Oh no.

27
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,750
Hey, Mister!

28
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,220
No.

29
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,710
No, no. I'm sure someone else saw.

30
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,260
By the time I go in there,
someone else will have saved him.

31
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,300
Ha Jin, you don't need to.
No, you don't.

32
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,190
Even if you don't, someone else will...

33
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,350
Gosh! Why is it me again!

34
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,650
Eun Yool!

35
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,570
Honey, it's our Eun Yool!

36
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,980
Eun Yool, Eun Yool!

37
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,820
Eun Yool, wait!

38
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,080
Eun Yool!

39
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,130
- Grab my hand.
- Okay.

40
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,790
Grab on to me. Hold on.

41
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,170
<i>How could you do this to me?</i>

42
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,150
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

43
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,960
<i>[Goryeo, Songak (Kaesong)]</i>

44
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,050
It's the wolf dog! The wolf!

45
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,800
The wolf dog.

46
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,000
<i>[4th Prince Wang So]</i>

47
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,910
- Hurry, let's go!
- Okay, I'm coming.

48
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,080
<i>[10th Prince Wang Eun]</i>

49
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,830
<i>[14th Prince Wang Jung]</i>

50
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,730
Jung.

51
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,210
Brother!

52
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,950
<i>[3rd Prince Wang Yo]</i>

53
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,170
<i>[13th Prince Baek Ah]</i>

54
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,700
<i>[8th Prince Wang Wook]</i>

55
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,360
<i>[9th Prince Wang Won]</i>

56
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,650
Brother, feel this.

57
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,250
Do you see this definition here?

58
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,160
Jung, I'll be going now.

59
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,240
Eun, wait for me.

60
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,320
Eun!

61
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,700
Brother.

62
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,350
Is our fourth brother not here yet?

63
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,870
He should come bathe if he is
to attend the spiritual ritual.

64
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,920
Has he ever done things our way?

65
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,600
Do not bother with him.
It's too much of a pain.

66
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,120
Don't you know how Wook is?

67
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,710
He is always worrying about others.

68
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,550
Wang So was the only one
born in the same year I was.

69
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,690
I should at least take care of him.

70
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,310
This is the first time So will be
attending the spiritual ritual, right?

71
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,930
I wonder if His Majesty has a
specific reason for telling him to come.

72
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,690
Use steam and make sure to
get all the wrinkles out.

73
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,210
Baek Ah.

74
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:13,820
Did you hear that our fourth brother
massacred his family out in Shinju?

75
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,410
They say it was very brutal,
like a wolf killing people.

76
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,790
You can't believe
all the rumors like that.

77
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,480
All the criminals in the nation
don't even talk about things like that.

78
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,050
All our visitors from Shinju say so.
It must be true.

79
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,900
It is merely a rumor.

80
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,570
How can he take down a
local government on his own?

81
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,010
What about the local army?

82
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,890
Even good martial arts skills
would not suffice.

83
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,770
Also, So has never had a master
who taught him to fight.

84
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,850
Jung, you and So have the same mother.

85
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,270
You never know when
you'll turn into a wolf too.

86
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,680
Shut your mouths.

87
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,600
Then, I am born from the same womb
as our fourth brother.

88
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,530
Am I not a person, as well?

89
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,230
His jokes were too harsh.

90
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,690
I will speak to him later on.
Please don't take it to heart.

91
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:12,330
4th Prince So will be returning to
Shinju once the spiritual ritual is over.

92
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,790
If the king hears about any nonsense,
I will not stand idly by.

93
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,220
Do you understand?

94
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,290
Brothers, should we make a bet on
who can float the longest?

95
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,430
Let's go to the outer pool.

96
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,090
Eun, that's enough. I said that's enough.

97
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,490
If you give me just one chance,
I can get him to be quiet.

98
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,840
It's fine.

99
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,400
Brothers! Come quickly.

100
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,910
Jung, come now.

101
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,630
<i>What is this place?</i>

102
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,330
<i>I must be alive.</i>

103
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:19,020
<i>What a relief. What a total relief!</i>

104
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,270
Hey! You... you...

105
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,310
What are you doing here?

106
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,880
Why is there a girl...

107
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,650
Brothers, brothers!

108
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:44,010
Brothers, brothers, brothers!

109
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,840
Lady, lady.

110
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,460
- Me?
- What is it?

111
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,840
Brothers!

112
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,680
It's a girl!

113
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,840
It's a girl! A girl!

114
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,130
- Lady!
- A girl!

115
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,090
Is anyone there?

116
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,620
Hey, stop right there.

117
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,140
Stop!

118
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,040
You dare to spy on the princes?

119
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,300
Hae Soo?

120
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,350
What do we do now?
You're in trouble.

121
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,330
Hurry, Lady. We need to go.

122
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,310
This is not the time for this.

123
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,650
Hurry.

124
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,330
What are we going to do?

125
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,500
Faster. Goodness...

126
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:42,340
You didn't come outside for so long.
I knew something was wrong.

127
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,540
The princes had starting bathing
and I couldn't even go looking for you.

128
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,170
This is just insane. Hurry up. Let's go.

129
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,040
You're feeling okay now, aren't you?

130
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,280
<i>Lady? Princes? </i>

131
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,580
<i>This is strange.
How did I end up here?</i>

132
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,510
- Let's go.
- Wait.

133
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,440
I...

134
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,840
Do you know me?

135
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,920
What?

136
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,050
This doesn't look like the park.

137
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,920
What am I doing here?

138
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,750
La... Lady!

139
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,420
What do you mean you
don't know where this is?

140
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,370
This is the largest
washing area in Songak.

141
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:49,790
<i>What is this? I really am dead.</i>

142
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,770
<i>So, this place is...</i>

143
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,720
<i>the afterlife?</i>

144
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,220
Lady Soo!

145
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,100
<i>[Goryeo Palace]</i>

146
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,860
<i>Open the door!</i>

147
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,900
I will leave a servant with you, Prince.

148
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,520
Once the ritual is over,
do not delay and return to Shinju.

149
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,770
You are also an adopted member of
our Kang household, so do not forget.

150
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:42,380
Please uphold our family name
in the king's presence.

151
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,180
An adopted member?

152
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,350
And here I thought I was
your hostage this entire time.

153
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:55,080
You cannot use your sword
inside the palace.

154
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,240
Shall I prepare a horse for your return?

155
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,540
I won't be going back.

156
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,080
<i>I won't be going back.</i>

157
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,850
<i>I won't be letting myself
return to Shinju as a hostage.</i>

158
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,110
Soo!

159
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,720
You are finally awake.

160
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,630
Are you still in a lot of pain?

161
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,620
Did I get very hurt?

162
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,800
Don't even bring it up.

163
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,250
You fell so hard.
I thought your head would burst.

164
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,550
Do you know how worried Lady Hae was?

165
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,440
- Hae Soo.
- By the way...

166
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:04,000
Why do you keep calling me Hae Soo?

167
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,310
My name is Go Ha Jin.

168
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,570
What?

169
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:13,740
Why are you calling me
"Hae Soo" or "Lady"?

170
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,990
I don't understand why I'm
being called these things.

171
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:22,860
Ah, right. I died.

172
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,880
You didn't die. You nearly did.

173
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,170
I'm not dead?

174
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,290
<i>It wasn't a dream.</i>

175
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,230
<i>If I'm not dead...</i>

176
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,180
<i>where am I?</i>

177
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,680
Soo!

178
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,460
Soo.

179
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,420
Get the doctor now.

180
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,450
Yes, Lady.

181
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,750
Where is this place?

182
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,210
No, no... who am I?

183
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,150
Are you unable to remember at all?

184
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,210
Your name is Hae Soo.

185
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,490
Hae Soo.

186
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,490
I'm your sixth cousin, Myung Hee.

187
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,280
<i>Hae Soo?</i>

188
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,270
<i>I'm Hae Soo?</i>

189
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:13,310
<i>I'm not... inside another
person's body, am I?</i>

190
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:25,050
Think about it carefully.
Take a close look at me.

191
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,110
You are in Songak right now.

192
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:32,460
This is the home of the
8th Prince Wang Wook.

193
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,430
Songak, you say?

194
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,830
Then, this is Goryeo?

195
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,730
Goguryeo, Baekje, Silla,
and Goryeo... that Goryeo?

196
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,450
Do you remember now?
Yes, it is that Goryeo.

197
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,960
Then, right now...

198
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,550
who is the king?

199
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,790
It is His Majesty who
founded this land, of course.

200
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,660
<i>His Majesty who founded Goryeo...</i>

201
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,250
<i>It can't be...</i>

202
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,980
Taejo Wang Geon?

203
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,160
This is the bird that ate the
Crown Prince's breakfast today.

204
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,060
This happened even before
it could swallow the first bite.

205
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,000
It was great luck that the Crown Prince

206
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,930
skipped his meal
because he was not hungry.

207
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,520
<i>[Taejo Wang Geon]</i>

208
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,060
Why is there no response?

209
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,990
Catch the person who tried to
kill the Crown Prince.

210
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,520
<i>[Wang Shik Ryeom]</i>
We should figure out why it happened.

211
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,500
What would change just because
we catch the culprit?

212
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,270
Minister Wang Shik Ryeom,
what is it you are trying to say?

213
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,910
Is the Crown Prince acting
like a Crown Prince?

214
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,190
<i>[Crown Prince - 1st Prince Moo]</i>

215
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,640
<i>At the assembly meeting</i>

216
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,240
<i>he only received greetings from the
foreign envoys and left.</i>

217
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:09,550
He is either on the battlefield or
visiting all known hot springs.

218
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,730
Did you know that there is a rumor that

219
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,310
the Crown Prince has
an incurable illness?

220
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:21,220
Therefore I, Wang Shik Ryeom,
am making a request you.

221
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:26,050
Please depose the 1st Prince Moo
as Crown Prince.

222
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:29,610
<i>I entreat you to name a new Crown Prince.</i>

223
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,020
Do you all agree with him?

224
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,470
Speak up.

225
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:39,490
Who among you
do you think will suit the position

226
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,860
if not the current Crown Prince?

227
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,110
Please withdraw those words,
Your Majesty.

228
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:57,230
There is no one among us
who wishes to become Crown Prince.

229
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,210
That is true, Your Majesty.

230
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,280
Please withdraw your words.

231
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,170
Yes, please withdraw them.

232
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,030
Please withdraw your words, Your Majesty!

233
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,570
Astronomer Choi Ji Mong.

234
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,420
Loyal subject Choi Ji Mong

235
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,600
will relay the will of the heavens
to all of you here.

236
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:35,360
Crown Prince Wang Moo's star
is a royal star in the sky.

237
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,930
It is the first star of the
five northern stars

238
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:40,700
and it shines brighter every day.

239
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:45,880
It shines brighter along with
the king's shining palace of Goryeo.

240
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,420
This means that he is not
lacking as the Crown Prince.

241
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:55,750
It has been 24 years since
this land has been founded.

242
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,760
The 1st Prince Wang Moo
fought with me in many wars.

243
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,540
He laid the foundation for this nation.

244
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,460
Choi Ji Mong.

245
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,230
During this spiritual ritual

246
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,870
Wang Moo will
chase away the evil spirits.

247
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,700
Prepare for it with great detail.

248
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,250
Yes, Your Majesty!

249
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,160
<i>[Queen Yoo]</i>

250
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,010
That is true.

251
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,610
The Crown Prince is very lucky.

252
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,950
He has a very long life.

253
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,720
We have only made him
more aware and vigilant now.

254
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,300
It is the court lady.

255
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,110
Tell him I do not want to see anyone.

256
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,310
It has been two years
since the 4th Prince has come.

257
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,180
If you could just meet him--

258
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,130
I am not well right now.

259
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,180
Who would dare to disturb the queen?

260
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:08,220
<i>[4th Prince So]</i>

261
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,020
What about my mother?

262
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:21,610
Queen Yoo has fallen asleep,
as she is very ill.

263
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,720
Perhaps you should
come back another time.

264
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,280
<i>I died back then.</i>

265
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,830
<i>This girl Hae Soo must have drowned
and died in the water too.</i>

266
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:11,100
<i>Then, am I Go Ha Jin or am I Hae Soo?</i>

267
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:19,120
<i>I don't know how I managed to
get to Goryeo and into this body.</i>

268
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,830
<i>Try to be positive.</i>

269
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,490
<i>You have a chance here.</i>

270
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,570
<i>A chance to avoid death, and live.</i>

271
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,870
<i>You're really lucky here.</i>

272
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:31,380
<i>Okay, so don't get caught
and just get through this.</i>

273
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,500
<i>If you get through this...</i>

274
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,230
<i>If you get through this...</i>

275
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,440
<i>I'm not Hae Soo, so I'll get caught.</i>

276
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,850
<i>What do I do?</i>

277
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,410
<i>- Lady!
- Soo.</i>

278
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:51,060
<i>Come out and talk. Please come outside.</i>

279
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:55,220
<i>Lady, please open the door.</i>

280
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,160
<i>What are you planning on doing?</i>

281
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:02,800
<i>What kind of world is out there?</i>

282
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,990
<i>I'm scared.</i>

283
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,610
<i>I'm scared to death.</i>

284
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,260
<i>I don't even know anything about Goryeo.</i>

285
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,290
<i>King Taejo is the founder of Goryeo.</i>

286
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,120
<i>After Taejo...</i>

287
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,530
After Taejo...

288
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,400
<i>Why are you being like this?</i>

289
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,000
Gwangjong?

290
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,320
<i>[8th Prince Wook]</i>

291
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,510
Lady.

292
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,220
Lady.

293
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,340
What is going on?

294
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,120
- It's Lady Soo!
- Hae Soo?

295
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:44,780
She fell into the water and
didn't come out for two hours.

296
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,790
According to the doctor...

297
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,630
she stopped breathing.

298
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:52,580
Then, are you saying Soo died?

299
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,020
She died and came back.

300
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:58,090
Maybe that's why she lost all her
memories and doesn't even know her name.

301
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,390
I'm worried that she will do
something dangerous, at this rate.

302
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,540
Soo, do not be afraid.

303
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,200
I brought you to this place.

304
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,550
So... I will help you until the very end.

305
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:58,960
<i>You brought me to this place?</i>

306
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,900
Avoiding this will not change anything.

307
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,100
You have to be strong.

308
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:21,950
Won't you trust me and come outside?

309
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,710
<i>I can't go back anymore.</i>

310
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:36,470
<i>And I can't change
the way things are now.</i>

311
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,720
<i>Then, I want to live!</i>

312
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,790
<i>I want to do whatever I can
to survive and live.</i>

313
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,920
<i>I want to live.</i>

314
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:28,000
<i>What do you mean, a wife?</i>

315
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,690
<i>- Your Majesty!
- Move.</i>

316
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,000
<i>[Younger So, Crown Prince Moo]</i>
Your Majesty.

317
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,410
I will die.

318
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:40,180
Our first-born son has died.

319
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,930
How can you get married?

320
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,310
How can you marry at a time like this?

321
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:47,120
South Goryeo is in danger.

322
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,990
This marriage is the way
to deflect that danger.

323
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:54,200
Before you are a ruler,
you are the father of my children.

324
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,580
Are you not sad?

325
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,880
Does your heart not feel torn?

326
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,900
Don't you wish you could die
and bring back your child?

327
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,260
There are lives at stake.

328
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,890
King.

329
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,090
If that is all you care about...

330
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,730
why should we bother living anymore?

331
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:26,780
Mother.

332
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,550
Do you choose to marry,
or do you choose your son?

333
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,710
- Queen!
- Choose.

334
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:42,580
Is it Goryeo or your son's life?

335
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,450
Put down that knife.

336
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:47,450
You cannot stop my marriage
by doing this.

337
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:54,130
You really are something.
You really are.

338
00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:00,400
If I do not have your whole heart,
I do not need it.

339
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,980
So!

340
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,270
So!

341
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,520
Is anyone out there?

342
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:56,590
Have you brought me here to be
one of the Crown Prince's men?

343
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:00,160
I don't know if you will be
a shield for the Crown Prince...

344
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,140
or a sword out to get him.

345
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,670
<i>[8th Prince Wook's Residence]</i>

346
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,240
You always liked playing arrows,
so you would make bets and play.

347
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,710
And that tree sapling over there?
We planted it together.

348
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,480
You're really good
at playing shuttlecock.

349
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,890
Okay, so I like throwing arrows
and shuttlecock.

350
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:56,570
I'm here to nurse and keep
my sixth cousin company.

351
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:57,780
That's right.

352
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,920
My name is Hae Soo.

353
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,270
You're my servant, Chae Ryung.

354
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,350
Right?

355
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:13,540
I think I'm starting to remember now.

356
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:16,710
You're using honorifics with me.

357
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:20,150
Really... What's wrong with you, Lady?

358
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,900
Oh yeah. I forgot.

359
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:28,410
Chae Ryung, don't you worry.

360
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,330
Why is that? Do you remember?

361
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:34,510
I think I do but maybe I don't.

362
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,910
You really don't need to worry.

363
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,780
I'm the type of person
who learns one thing

364
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,150
and picks up 10 other things.

365
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,730
I'll keep trying.

366
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:49,570
Is it really true that
you don't remember anything?

367
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:56,070
It's just the two of us.
You can tell me.

368
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,650
- You're lying, right?
- What?

369
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:02,760
The prince and his wife don't know.

370
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:07,020
I've been by your side every day.

371
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,880
What is this really about?

372
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:14,090
Did you have a rendezvous with a
gentleman from another household?

373
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,320
Or do you have a lot of debt?

374
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:27,540
Is Hae Soo this kind of girl?

375
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,610
So, does she pretend to be a good girl

376
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:35,810
but then she goes out
to meet men at night?

377
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,580
She's not that bad.

378
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,080
But why are you speaking like
you're talking about another person?

379
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:46,180
Oh! You really must be injured.

380
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,200
<i>I should keep my mouth shut.</i>

381
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,230
<i>They'll say I'm crazy
if I say I'm not Hae Soo.</i>

382
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:53,140
- Chae Ryung.
- Yes.

383
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:01,280
There is another girl inside of me.

384
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:06,150
<i>Never mind.</i>

385
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,560
<i>No need to die twice.</i>

386
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,910
I was just kidding.

387
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,280
Chae Ryung.

388
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,060
I have no wrinkles
around my mouth, right?

389
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,530
What?

390
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,680
Oh my! Oh!

391
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,310
Oh! She is so nice and firm.

392
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:36,150
I haven't been in this great of shape
in a long time.

393
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,190
Oh, my word.

394
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:43,370
She took great care of herself in Goryeo
even though they just ate vegetables.

395
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,990
Oh... oh, Lady.

396
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,420
She is very severely injured.

397
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:53,740
There are positives to being alive again.

398
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:59,850
<i>[Cheomseongdae Palace]</i>

399
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:16,320
Wow! Take a look at this.

400
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,920
What is this?

401
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,080
What is it?

402
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,250
Ji Mong, Ji Mong!

403
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,610
10th Prince!

404
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,460
This is a plane.

405
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,510
Plane?

406
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,370
What is that?

407
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:35,870
It is a tool used to fly
in the sky like a bird.

408
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:38,860
Someday, your children
will have children.

409
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:42,090
Those children will have
their own children.

410
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:48,420
People will use this to go to
foreign lands and travel.

411
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,280
Wow!

412
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,810
Ji Mong is always making amazing things.

413
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:56,310
You're always staring up at the sky.
You're saying strange things more often.

414
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:58,750
What you said about the
star of the Crown Prince...

415
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,370
is that even the truth?

416
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:02,680
That's what I wanted to say.

417
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,720
The person who knows the will of the
heavens is a subject of the Crown Prince.

418
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,530
Everyone in Goryeo knows that.

419
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:10,960
I read the skies for a living.
Do you think I would lie?

420
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,130
Then, Ji Mong. What is my fortune?

421
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:17,360
If you get mine right,
I'll assume you were correct earlier.

422
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,410
The day of the 13th Prince's birth

423
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:30,590
was when Mercury, Venus, Mars,
and Jupiter were all in alignment, right?

424
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:33,120
That's how great men were in the past.

425
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:37,540
You have quite the luck with the females.

426
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,510
What? Are there no other men?

427
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,820
Even I can guess that.

428
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:47,960
Who doesn't know that girls all over
Songak fall over themselves for Baek Ah?

429
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,580
If that's all you're doing, our 3rd
brother has great fortune in governing.

430
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,860
- Our 9th brother has luck in wealth.
- Yes.

431
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,060
Our 8th brother has blessings
in high intelligence.

432
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:59,090
My 10th brother has...

433
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,260
My 10th brother doesn't really--

434
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,890
I have the younger brother blessing.

435
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:08,060
- Hey!
- You little...

436
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:12,550
I feel a little hurt.

437
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:15,890
You always enjoyed my stories before.

438
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:17,950
Now you don't believe me?

439
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,510
That was when we were young.

440
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:22,560
We're all grown up now.
We won't be fooled by you any longer.

441
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,770
Yes, you are all adults now.

442
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:29,300
I won't be able to persuade you all
with my words alone.

443
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,070
Eun, he says we're all grown up.

444
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,990
I'm not finished growing yet.

445
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:35,080
It's all right.
You're big in other areas.

446
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,980
His heart and consideration for others.

447
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,690
Yeah, that's true.

448
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,910
About our fourth brother...

449
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:57,980
I heard he's in the palace.
Why hasn't he come to say hello to you?

450
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:01,890
You heard about how he killed
the horse he rode in on, right?

451
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:04,920
I heard that the officers who saw
are having nightmares.

452
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,920
They all took the day off.

453
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,880
Why did he do such a thing?

454
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,950
Being the way he is,
I would refuse his greeting if he came.

455
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:14,910
He is probably suffering
more than anyone.

456
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,760
Don't be like that. He is your brother.

457
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:34,800
It's been a long time.

458
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,680
Yes.

459
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,230
Oh! Eun!

460
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,860
Are you all right?

461
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,650
Was it just me who couldn't breathe?

462
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:55,710
I don't know.

463
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,170
Chae Ryung.

464
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:18,770
What is the 8th Prince like?

465
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,660
I just can't remember.

466
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:24,020
He is the best man in all of Goryeo.

467
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:27,500
He's just as well educated
as any scholar out there.

468
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,550
He is a man of good character,
the best of all 25 princes.

469
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:34,870
Many believe that the Crown Prince
should not be the 1st Prince.

470
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:38,080
They believe it should our prince.

471
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:42,420
Is he Gwangjong?

472
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,380
They look like they have
a great relationship.

473
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,020
Of course.

474
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:59,260
He is so caring and
considerate of his sick wife.

475
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:02,400
She trusts him and
would follow him anywhere.

476
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,710
Everyone is so envious.

477
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:44,850
<i>I suppose I felt I could trust him too.</i>

478
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:09,940
This is disrespectful.

479
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:25,460
We would like to greet you, Princess.

480
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,420
Lady.

481
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:32,280
You should greet Princess Yeon Hwa.

482
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:35,580
<i>This woman is a princess?</i>

483
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,740
<i>Sure, there are princes.
Of course there's a princess.</i>

484
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:45,090
Leave her be.
I heard she lost her memory.

485
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:48,480
However, it seems she lost
her manners too. What shall we do?

486
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,310
I suppose it would not hurt for you
to learn from the very beginning.

487
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,100
<i>She likes to put people down
in a strange, roundabout way.</i>

488
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,080
You should not be looking at
what a married couple is doing.

489
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:06,160
I will deal with it harshly
if it happens again

490
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,370
even if you are her cousin.

491
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,060
Do you understand?

492
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:18,120
<i>Those crooked eyes and mouth.</i>

493
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,150
<i>Look how tense her hand looks.</i>

494
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:25,280
<i>I've been through all sorts of crap
before and this right here...</i>

495
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,640
If you don't like me, just say so.

496
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,550
- What did you say?
- I can tell just by looking.

497
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:36,420
You're trying to look for a reason to
pick on me in order to set me straight.

498
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:41,270
That doesn't work on me.
I have been through this a lot.

499
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:44,110
What is this girl saying to me?

500
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:46,110
Forgive her, Princess.

501
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,450
Lady Soo is not of sound mind yet.

502
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:51,700
Are you saying I'm crazy?

503
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,930
No, that's not it.

504
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:56,630
You wench. You dare act
that way in this household?

505
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:57,910
Wench?

506
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,830
What is all this commotion?

507
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,690
Brother.

508
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,040
You must have forgotten how to
greet people since your injury.

509
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,120
Ah... hi.

510
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:41,310
Hello. Hello, Prince...

511
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:45,340
They say you do not remember anything.

512
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,170
Then, you must not recognize me either.

513
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:50,870
I heard that you're the 8th Prince.

514
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,390
You heard that?

515
00:46:56,530 --> 00:47:00,610
Then, did you spy on the princes bathing
before or after you lost your memory?

516
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:05,150
Oh, that... I don't really remember.

517
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:13,660
All right, then what do you
plan on doing now?

518
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:16,660
I will allow you to do
whatever you wish to do.

519
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,260
What?

520
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:24,270
When my wife brought you here,
I planned on watching over you.

521
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:27,220
You can receive more treatment
or go back to your hometown.

522
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,610
It may be difficult to live here
since you do not remember.

523
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:33,020
- I'll help you set up a small place.
- Why?

524
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,070
What do you mean, why?

525
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:45,530
I'm the one who got hurt.
Why would you take care of me?

526
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:50,470
Ah... because I'm your wife's cousin.

527
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,590
But, still...

528
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:57,560
it's not in my personality to
take handouts from people.

529
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,780
I'll handle it.

530
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,400
Hand... handouts?

531
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:10,150
I'm having trouble understanding you.

532
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:12,020
What is the term you're using?

533
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:15,640
And you...

534
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:21,330
Anyway, I'm going to get through it
and stay in this house.

535
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:29,830
I can't remember anything,
so I can't go anywhere else.

536
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:32,870
Lady Hae, Chae Ryung, and you are here.

537
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:37,770
You're all being very kind and
I think I can get through it here.

538
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:40,710
There isn't anything that I can't do.

539
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:42,210
I'm very smart.

540
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:45,000
So, I'm a very fast learner.

541
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,860
You'll know once you see me.

542
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,320
I will become someone
you need in this household.

543
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:53,230
I'll do my best to learn everything.

544
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:56,720
I won't be a burden to you, Prince.

545
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:08,510
You...

546
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,900
seem like a different person.

547
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,240
We were never close.

548
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,470
The way you talk and your actions.

549
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:24,100
You're a different person.

550
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:33,090
It does not matter to me.

551
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:34,410
What?

552
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,500
I won't press you further
about whether or not you remember

553
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,060
or if you spied on the princes.

554
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:43,130
You must not make Lady Hae worry.

555
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:46,790
All right?

556
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,520
Yes, Prince Wook.

557
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,050
You may leave.

558
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:57,490
I'll work very hard from now on.

559
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,400
"Get through it"?

560
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:39,090
That's the latest book.

561
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:40,790
Do you want to borrow it?

562
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,370
Why did you ask to see me?

563
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:52,390
The servant who served
the Crown Prince his breakfast

564
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:54,320
was found hanging from a noose.

565
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:59,160
The assassination was
covered up by a suicide.

566
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,630
Doesn't that mean the culprit must
be a royal family member?

567
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:04,950
Particularly, one of the princes.

568
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,430
Find the culprit.

569
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:13,600
Find the culprit? Am I a dog?

570
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:18,670
People keep calling me a wolf dog.
Now you really think I'm a dog.

571
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:22,100
Did you have fun killing that horse?

572
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:26,230
You want to stop living as some hostage
and live in Songak, right?

573
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:31,810
This will give you that chance, Prince.

574
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:33,840
Take that chance when you have it.

575
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,080
Look at me.

576
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,980
I said the king would realize his dream
of unifying the Three Han states.

577
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,990
Now look where I am.

578
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:42,680
Don't use those tricks on me.

579
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:46,990
I'm not that little kid who liked it
when you used to come find me.

580
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:52,020
Do not think of playing me.

581
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,480
It's what the Crown Prince wants.

582
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:11,990
We received a tip that there is a plan

583
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:13,880
to kill the Crown Prince
during the ritual.

584
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,030
Oh...

585
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:20,600
You want me to pretend to be you?

586
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:25,060
Then, what will you
promise to me in return?

587
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:27,160
How about you catch the culprit too?

588
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:30,520
Then I will do whatever you ask.

589
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:41,820
I will live in Songak.

590
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,560
Every year, our home had the most
beautiful lotus lanterns, thanks to you.

591
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,370
It will be hard this year.

592
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:08,880
It must be because
my wound hasn't healed.

593
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,680
My hand is not doing what I want it to.

594
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,680
What can we do?
You're not doing it on purpose.

595
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:17,850
You should rest. Go on out.

596
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,660
No. I shouldn't rest alone.

597
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,200
I'll do whatever is necessary.
Give me work to do.

598
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,140
How great of you to offer.

599
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:32,530
Then, Chae Ryung.

600
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:35,460
Show your lady
where you go to mix the glue.

601
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,960
You can help out with that, right?

602
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,890
Of course, it's not a big deal.

603
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,910
Oh... that Princess Yeon Hwa
or whatever...

604
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,700
She acted like she was thinking of me.

605
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,120
That awful...

606
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:01,820
Gosh, how long do I have to do this for?

607
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:07,930
I know how to do skincare.

608
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:12,810
Massages and makeup.
I have a truckload of licenses.

609
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:15,720
But look at me here.

610
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:19,840
I'm like dog food.

611
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,750
Oh no! What am I going to do?
I knew this would happen.

612
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:03,360
Princess Yeon Hwa gave me the
important task of making this glue.

613
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:11,390
You said you would learn everything
and get through it.

614
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:15,370
It looks like you are doing very well.

615
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:20,890
You are quite the amazing person.

616
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,920
Where's So? When is he coming?

617
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,670
It's his first time,
so we should practice.

618
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:27,240
The 4th Prince will arrive soon.

619
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,840
I heard that when the ritual is over...

620
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,040
there is a rumor the king will be

621
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,860
abdicating the throne
to the Crown Prince.

622
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,570
What?

623
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:42,110
Is there really a rumor like that?

624
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:45,150
Oh my! I have never heard such a thing.

625
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:50,450
Even if it were true,
the king would never tell me.

626
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:52,140
I'm merely the astronomer.

627
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:55,360
I need to go see the Crown Prince
about his role in the ritual.

628
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,930
Why don't you all keep practicing?

629
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:01,040
My goodness!

630
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:07,720
You shouldn't have done that.
What if the king hears about it?

631
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:12,080
You did a thoughtless thing.

632
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:15,550
He wasn't the only one who was curious.
Don't blame him too much.

633
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:20,030
Choi Ji Mong did not say it wasn't true.

634
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,680
It's the dog! The wolf dog!

635
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:44,490
It's the wolf!

636
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:51,280
It's the wolf!

637
