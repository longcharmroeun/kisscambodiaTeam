4
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,410
It's raining!

5
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,190
It's raining! It's rain!

6
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,070
The heavens have answered us!

7
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,000
It is finally raining.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,580
It is raining!

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,610
It is finally raining!

10
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,000
Rain!

11
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,370
Gwangjong.

12
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,160
A hero is born. A hero.

13
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,120
How did he hide that scar anyway?

14
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,410
I think he used cosmetics.

15
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,930
I don't know who did it,
but she is very skilled.

16
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,560
The heavens chose our
fourth brother for a reason.

17
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,110
You must not treat So carelessly anymore.

18
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,600
<i>It was the 4th Prince.</i>

19
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,970
<i>Prince Wang So is Gwangjong.</i>

20
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,020
<i>His brothers, nephews,
and longtime subjects...</i>

21
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,050
<i>they say he killed them all.</i>

22
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,880
<i>He's that Gwangjong.</i>

23
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,730
<i>He killed them?</i>

24
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,420
Your Highness, you have saved us!

25
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,550
You are our savior!

26
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,890
You have saved us all!

27
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,600
Thank you!

28
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,750
<i>Is he going to become
a king because of me?</i>

29
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,190
<i>Because I covered his scar?</i>

30
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,830
<i>No, his name was already
recorded in history.</i>

31
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,310
<i>Even if I hadn't done it,
he would've become a king.</i>

32
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:20,360
<i>But is Prince Wang So really going to...</i>

33
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,270
Soo, it's raining now.

34
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,230
The king will celebrate this rain.

35
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,560
Soo, what is it?

36
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,230
Will they all die because of me?

37
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,860
What?

38
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,130
That person...

39
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,430
is he becoming like that
because of me?

40
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,550
Is he?

41
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,190
You have to be safe, Your Highness.

42
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,750
<i>The 4th Prince was chosen by the heavens.</i>

43
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,370
There is no way the heavens chose him.

44
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,500
It should have been me.

45
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,580
That was my seat.

46
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,280
I should have brought the rain!

47
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,050
Mother.

48
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,250
How could you lose
an opportunity like that?

49
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,780
If someone tries to take what is yours

50
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,480
you must tear his throat out
to protect it if you must!

51
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,580
You should have taken it,
no matter what!

52
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,730
A mistake... it was a mistake.

53
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,120
- I can make mistakes too!
- No.

54
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,200
There are no mistakes.

55
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:24,590
If I am to rise up as a king's mother,
you must be persistent and ruthless.

56
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,040
Court Lady Hae from the Damiwon...

57
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,110
I am positive she covered up
So's scar with the use of makeup.

58
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,010
I am to raise you up, Mother?

59
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,310
Damiwon, Damiwon, Damiwon!

60
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,680
The girls at Damiwon are all troublesome.

61
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,250
I will burn that place down.

62
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,150
The 4th Prince So is here
to see His Majesty.

63
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:06,060
Prince Wang So,
you have accomplished a great feat.

64
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,350
You have saved this country.

65
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,150
I only led the rain ritual
in place of the Crown Prince.

66
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,440
Why is that important?

67
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,510
I was delayed by a pack of thieves.
I could not make it to the ritual.

68
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

69
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,500
How many years has it been since you've
shown your face to your father?

70
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,750
You have kept that scar to yourself
for so many years.

71
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,690
I have caused you to worry.

72
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,910
Father.

73
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,740
Show your bare face to the world now
and be confident.

74
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,740
Devote yourself to helping the
Crown Prince make a good nation.

75
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,550
You must become
a great source of strength.

76
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,670
Your father trusts you.

77
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,280
I accept your orders.

78
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,030
We can avoid the rain here for now.
Someone will bring us rain clothes soon.

79
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,840
Was it you who covered So's scar?

80
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,640
You can get into trouble for
touching the face of a prince.

81
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,300
You did a good thing.
You do not need to worry.

82
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,020
Also...

83
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,680
So may have stood in place of the
Crown Prince at the rain ritual.

84
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,640
But that does not change anything.

85
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,220
Really?

86
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,660
Of course not.

87
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,400
But things have to change.

88
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,100
Are they not going to change?

89
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,740
Now that the rain has fallen,
the king will celebrate.

90
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,050
It has been a long time since a court
lady has been released from service.

91
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,750
I'm certain that is what it will be.

92
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,410
I can't just do nothing.

93
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,440
- I need to find out.
- Soo.

94
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,460
Do you know who the next king will be?

95
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,080
I suppose it will be the Crown Prince
as long as nothing happens.

96
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:06,550
Then... what about
after the Crown Prince?

97
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,560
After him?

98
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,090
Gwangjong... that's what you said.

99
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,170
What?

100
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,230
You called Prince Wang So "Gwangjong".

101
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,040
I said that without realizing it.

102
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,300
It just came out.

103
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,660
I think I must have been
about four or five.

104
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,280
They say I nearly drowned to death.

105
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,820
No! They say that I did die.

106
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,970
But I woke up after a day.

107
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:48,240
You died... and came back to life?

108
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,740
My mother would often say to me

109
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,380
that once I came back to life,
I seemed completely different.

110
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,070
She said I seemed wise beyond my years.

111
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,560
I've never told anyone about this.

112
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,070
Often, I see scenes pass before my eyes

113
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,840
and I don't know if
they're real or dreams.

114
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,990
I see a big bird that
carries people in the sky.

115
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,550
I've even seen stairs and
a room that moves on its own.

116
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:16,300
I saw a building as high as the sky
filled with many, many people.

117
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,460
<i>Is this person from the future like me?</i>

118
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,280
<i>Maybe he can't remember
because he was too young.</i>

119
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,020
I heard that you also died and came back.

120
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,420
So I wondered if you had
the gift of foresight like I do.

121
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,600
Now ask me the question
you truly want to.

122
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,140
What is it that you really
want to know, Lady Soo?

123
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
<i>Is Prince So really Gwangjong?
Is he going to kill everyone?</i>

124
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,660
<i>What about Prince Wang Wook?
What is his future like?</i>

125
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,360
What...

126
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,000
should I do?

127
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,150
Nothing.

128
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,750
You mustn't do anything.

129
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,690
Whatever it is you saw,
let things flow naturally.
subtitles ripped,synced and added the missing lines by riri13

130
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,170
You cannot get involved.

131
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,710
What if I can change things?

132
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,010
I can stop trouble from occurring.

133
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,820
I can make something bad
into something good.

134
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,570
You have already laid your hands
on Prince Wang So's face.

135
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,900
So...

136
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,740
the prince's future...

137
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,690
will it change?

138
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,050
I do not know that.

139
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,170
The moment humans realize heaven's will,
that is called fate.

140
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,910
Did it change
or was it always meant to be?

141
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,960
Who knows these things?

142
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,120
We humans cannot escape
the will of the heavens.

143
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,320
Leave things to play out
the way they are meant to be.

144
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,930
That is what will keep you safe.

145
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,640
So has made it rain.

146
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,420
Now he will receive the King's trust.

147
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:43,710
Yes, he will.

148
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,680
If the Crown Prince was not
going to be the master of the ritual

149
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,220
you should have been
the one standing there.

150
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,960
It was a good opportunity.

151
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,460
It was a seat that was given to So.

152
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,050
It was necessary for So
to be in that seat.

153
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,080
I should not be greedy
for something like that.

154
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,020
Once you receive the favor of the king

155
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,130
it is easy to get
other ideas in your head.

156
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:13,610
I am only saying that we have another
person to be wary of in the palace.

157
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,270
Hae Soo said So would be different too.

158
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,720
Are you saying that, as well?

159
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,040
As for So...

160
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,600
why shouldn't he receive
the king's trust and confidence?

161
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,470
Think about the harsh treatment
he has received all this time.

162
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,400
Hae Soo warned you to
be careful of our 4th brother?

163
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,640
Why?

164
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,770
The person who helped So
take off his mask was...

165
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,810
Hae Soo.

166
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:46,060
She is afraid that something
will happen because of that.

167
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,240
As for me...

168
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,810
there must be a seat that
is necessary for me to fill.

169
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,170
What could it be?

170
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,440
I am very...

171
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,170
curious.

172
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,370
It's me.

173
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,100
It was so sudden.

174
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,610
You came at me so suddenly.

175
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,350
I didn't mean anything by it.

176
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,360
I was just so surprised, really.

177
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,760
I'm sorry.

178
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,450
Did I say anything about it?

179
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,780
You don't need to be sorry. I'm sorry.

180
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:27,650
For the first time in my life,
I called the king "Father".

181
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:35,980
It had been 15 years since he looked
at my face and my eyes properly.

182
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,490
He told me to be more confident.

183
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,880
After I heard those words,
all the pain I had just disappeared.

184
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,570
I'll have to be a great support
to the Crown Prince, like he said.

185
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,900
Everyone keeps thanking me.

186
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,670
No one says I'm scary
or calls me a beast.

187
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,940
It's funny.

188
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,510
I'm starting to like myself this way.

189
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,720
Also...

190
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,720
the person who made this way...

191
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,140
Hae Soo, it was you.

192
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,970
<i>A person like this is going to
become that cruel?</i>

193
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,360
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

194
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,880
<i>Choi Ji Mong said I should
never get involved.</i>

195
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,320
<i>I could help him and
change Gwangjong's future.</i>

196
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,840
No matter how angry you get,
you must hold it in.

197
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,310
Don't ever kill anyone.

198
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,940
You won't have any reason
to be hurt in the future.

199
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,460
Everyone will like you and treat you
as a precious person, okay?

200
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,940
Gosh, you and your lectures.

201
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,920
This is nice.

202
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,460
<i>I can do it.</i>

203
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,510
<i>I won't ignore it.</i>

204
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,180
<i>I won't let anyone get hurt.</i>

205
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:49,650
Lady Mong Ryang Won asked me
to find a suitable match for Soon Deok.

206
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,680
So, I'm thinking of choosing
one of the princes.

207
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,550
One of the princes?

208
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:10,590
The 14th Prince would be a
suitable match for Lady Soon Deok.

209
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,990
They both love the martial arts and
their horoscopes are a good fit.

210
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,320
Come now. What if husband
and wife got into a fight?

211
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,290
The two of them would
tear the house down.

212
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,520
Then how about the 13th Prince, Baek Ah?

213
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,700
He is Songak's best looking man.

214
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,540
She will be the envy of
all the girls in Goryeo.

215
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,770
She might be stoned to death
by them all. I don't think so.

216
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,320
The 4th Prince.

217
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,400
I don't know about the others.

218
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,670
However, they once learned
martial arts together

219
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,170
so there must be affection there.

220
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,510
One was busy killing bears and
the other was busy killing wolves.

221
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,100
They have never even met before.

222
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,370
If you don't like any of them,
then what shall we do?

223
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,990
Ah... the 8th Prince.

224
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:06,490
He should remarry, but his disposition
is so different from Lady Soon Deok.

225
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:11,240
Hey! You should count properly.
Why are you skipping over people?

226
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,810
Look... you forgot one.

227
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:16,910
What?

228
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:22,970
What?

229
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,930
Oh, do you really mean it?

230
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,550
Soo, I have something for you.
See me later.

231
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,660
Yes.

232
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,030
His Majesty, the king, is entering.

233
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,070
Hello, Your Majesty.

234
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,080
You've all been working hard.

235
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,080
Especially you, 4th Prince.

236
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,540
You relieved us from the drought
and I want to reward you.

237
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,330
Is there anything you want?

238
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,510
I thought of giving you Songak land
to build a home and some farmland.

239
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,610
Thank you, Your Majesty, but there is
something I want more than land.

240
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,260
All right, tell me.

241
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,360
Please give me Damiwon's
Court Lady Hae Soo.

242
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,440
What?

243
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,470
All right.

244
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:41,220
I suppose it would be good
to keep her close by to help you.

245
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,340
In recognition of your efforts

246
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,800
Damiwon's Hae Soo will promoted
to Senior Court Lady.

247
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,920
From now on, you must
actively assist the 4th Prince.

248
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,490
Yes, Your Majesty.

249
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,520
I will accept your command.

250
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:02,920
To celebrate the rain,
we will have a prince's marriage.

251
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,800
We will set a date soon.

252
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,730
It will be the Grand General's
daughter, Soon Deok

253
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,270
and the 10th Prince Eun,
who will be getting married.

254
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:20,860
Eun, you are getting married!
Congratulations.

255
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,710
I do not want to get married.

256
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,790
Are you shy?

257
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:36,170
You should have in-laws and
do your part as a royal family member.

258
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:40,460
There's still our fourth brother,
and our eighth brother is single again.

259
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,860
I'm still very young.

260
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,500
And that Park girl...

261
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:52,530
I just don't like it!
I refuse... I refuse to get married.

262
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:00,090
Your Majesty, please withdraw your words.

263
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,980
I really do not want this.

264
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,540
If you insist on this marriage...

265
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,790
I would rather die.

266
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,890
Instead than do what I ask,
you would rather die?

267
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:31,980
You would rather dishonor
your father and die instead?

268
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,880
<i>Those eyes mean</i>

269
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,610
<i>if he insists on refusing the marriage,</i>

270
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,080
<i>he'll kill him for sure.</i>

271
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,780
<i>Even if you're born as a prince,</i>

272
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,020
<i>one word from the king can change your whole life!</i>

273
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:50,170
Your Majesty, he must be so excited
that he does not know what he is saying.

274
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:54,230
Eun, go on and thank the king.  Go on.

275
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,850
Thank you for your great benevolence.

276
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,770
Eun, women are only different
on the first night.

277
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,980
After that, all women are the same.

278
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:39,560
I even get the names of my first
and second wife confused sometimes.

279
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,910
I do not want to live like you.

280
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,050
Oh, wait!

281
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,370
It's better not to see.

282
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,140
I feel down so I want to see.

283
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,900
I think it's better not to.

284
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,100
Move.

285
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,080
Go! You got it!

286
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,900
Great soldier, great soldier,
great soldier!

287
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,260
Well...

288
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,410
I guess it's for the bracelet you got me.

289
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,350
Or to celebrate me leaving the palace.

290
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:42,630
Myung Hee said that you
always had many worries.

291
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:46,380
She said I should make you that
so that you could sleep well.

292
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,570
Thank you.

293
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:59,840
I have something for you too.

294
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:11,520
It's a book.

295
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,470
I'll study very hard.

296
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,960
Look at it closely.

297
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,030
I know this.

298
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,460
I used to do this with my friends.

299
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,030
Did you draw this yourself?

300
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,220
Yes.

301
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,260
Wow.

302
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,980
Eun is getting married.

303
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,280
So, this time around...

304
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:59,010
a court lady will not be released
to celebrate the rain.

305
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,960
I'm sure we will get another chance.

306
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,770
I am Court Lady Oh's right hand woman.

307
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:16,500
I was actually worried about
how she'd get by without me.

308
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,920
I got promoted too.

309
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,790
I do not know when
another chance will come.

310
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,220
If you are willing to wait, Your Highness

311
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,660
I can wait.

312
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,360
You know, I think I've
seen this somewhere.

313
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,760
<i>I didn't want to say that I was worried.</i>

314
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,240
<i>That's why I asked you to wait.</i>

315
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,500
<i>Because I felt like
something would go wrong.</i>

316
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:08,600
When it snows again...
let's walk here.

317
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,520
Just the two of us.

318
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,170
I will wait.

319
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:31,020
I... love you.

320
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:09,060
The king prefers wild plant teas
over leaf teas.

321
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,030
You need to pay attention to details.

322
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:16,120
He's had headaches and
his eyesight is not good.

323
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,780
He eats cassia seeds and
Chinese matrimony vine fruit often.

324
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,000
He often gets thirsty
and wakes up in the night.

325
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,110
It is good to give him
herbal medicine for that.

326
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,240
Yes, Court Lady Oh.

327
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,770
Be careful of Prince Wang So.

328
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,340
What?

329
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:37,020
You tried to care for him and
now he learned how to care from you.

330
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:40,490
If you cannot give him your whole heart,
you need to make that clear.

331
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:47,030
What if...
I can change that person's life?

332
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,030
Should I still turn my back on him?

333
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:59,670
Before I came into the palace,
I gave my heart to a man.

334
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,560
He was an unknown commander who
would pick flowers and herbs with me.

335
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,600
I thought he would forget his ambitions
and live a normal life with me.

336
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,700
In the end, he rose to a place
where I couldn't dare to touch him.

337
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,430
Do you understand?

338
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,940
People do not change for others.

339
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:27,310
So you need to throw out the belief
that you can change a person.

340
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,430
You have to apply thoroughly with the brush

341
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:44,360
as if to fill the scar in order to make the scar look less distinct from the skin.

342
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,270
Make the tip of the brush flat before using it.

343
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,800
Are you telling me to do this myself

344
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,500
because it's too much of a hassle for you to help me?

345
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:53,840
It'll be more convenient for you to know how to do it yourself.

346
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:02,180
What is this?

347
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,220
Make-up recipe?

348
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,560
As men often put make-up on in Goryeo,

349
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,530
it may not be that noticeable anyway,

350
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,600
but if at all possible, make it as close
to your skin color as possible.

351
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:19,070
You can adjust the color using blush or adzuki bean powder.

352
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,600
Why have you become so different?

353
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,900
What?

354
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:37,050
What happened to the tomboy that argued with me word for word?

355
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:39,050
You've become too docile.

356
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,690
<i>Your Highness.</i>

357
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,530
The others are waiting to have tea and dessert with you.

358
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,870
I see.

359
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,800
I have been immature.

360
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,800
I will be more careful from now on.

361
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:14,170
I was only practicing a sword dance.

362
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:17,390
There's no need to be afraid.
I won't hurt you.

363
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:21,450
Here are some treats.

364
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:24,050
- Me too.
- Me too!

365
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:25,620
Eat it slowly.

366
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,190
- Yes.
- Share.

367
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,110
- Get going.
- Thank you.

368
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:37,730
I saw you before, right?

369
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:38,800
From Hubaekje?

370
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:42,390
You should pay for
the drawings you ripped.

371
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:46,710
If you have nothing to give me,
you could show me your sword dance.

372
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,290
I saw you before, right?

373
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:51,340
That money insect.

374
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,370
Money insect?

375
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,070
Drawings and instruments.

376
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:57,150
You work hard to please the nobles.

377
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,980
You're diligent.

378
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,750
You came because of my music, right?

379
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:05,370
Anyone in Songak who dances can't help
but move once my music starts.

380
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,230
Let me see you dance.

381
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,970
You never know.
I might play my great music.

382
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:12,020
I don't dance for strange men.

383
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,390
You're very picky.

384
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,990
Then, we can introduce ourselves.

385
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,340
I'm Baek Ah. How about you?

386
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,540
Baek Ah?

387
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,590
If you are Baek Ah,
I am one of your attendants.

388
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:29,040
You don't have any honesty
in you at all.

389
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,970
It's a waste of your talents,
so don't live that way.

390
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,850
I really am Baek Ah.

391
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:41,380
Ah, you must not know because
you haven't been in Songak very long.

392
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,330
I'm the 13th...

393
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,890
She disappeared again.

394
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:04,720
This thing... it's unique like its owner.

395
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,600
She called me an insect.

396
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,470
I shouldn't live my life this way?

397
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:15,260
I've only met you twice,
but you are so nosy about my life.

398
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,620
Let's go.

399
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,080
What are you doing?

400
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,980
You're Hae Soo, aren't you?
We must go to the 10th Prince now.

401
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,070
What?

402
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:39,410
You're the only one who can
get through to the prince.

403
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,550
I'm afraid something might happen to him.

404
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,750
You have to go to him.

405
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,890
I don't know what this is about,
but I shouldn't get involved.

406
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:49,650
You can even be his second wife!

407
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,100
As long as you serve the prince well...

408
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,550
I am fine with it.

409
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,410
I will speak to the king
and my father about it.

410
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,220
Should I really do this?

411
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,560
Eun will die if he does not go.

412
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,000
Do it if you want to save his life.

413
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,480
Wait!

414
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,070
It's me, Hae Soo.

415
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,050
Open the door now.

416
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,560
You shouldn't be doing this. Go now.

417
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,340
Open this door now!

418
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:52,550
I won't ever speak to you again
if you don't open it.

419
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,520
Does it change anything to get drunk?

420
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,060
If you get drunk,
does that mean you don't have to marry?

421
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,300
You do not know I feel.

422
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:40,690
You like me, but now you must
marry someone you don't like.

423
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,090
You knew? But why...

424
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:53,860
Then... then Soo...

425
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:01,030
Will you be my second wife?

426
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:05,810
The king and my brothers have many wives.

427
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:06,880
It is not a bad thing.

428
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:11,830
Even if you are not the first wife,
I will only be good to you.

429
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:14,050
- So, Soo--
- No.

430
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,800
I cannot live that way.

431
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:23,210
I can't share my husband
with several women.

432
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,910
I don't want to grow old while
waiting for him to come to me.

433
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:32,270
Liar.

434
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,780
Even if I had asked you
to be my first wife

435
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,730
you would have said no.

436
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:57,560
I'm stupid. I know that.

437
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:04,820
I have always been stupid.

438
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,090
That is probably why you don't like me.

439
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,440
I was happiest while I was with you,
Your Highness.

440
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,730
You laugh when you're happy
and you know to cry when you're sad.

441
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:24,940
So I never felt anxious with you,
Your Highness.

442
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:29,040
I was able to laugh, cry,
and get angry to my heart's content.

443
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,920
I do not want that kind of consolation.

444
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,910
You are a mean girl.

445
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:51,120
If I said that I was sorry,
that would be truly mean, right?

446
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:55,760
So...

447
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,990
I am not going to apologize.

448
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,110
Did you...

449
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,250
ever even like me?

450
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,530
I still like you very much now.

451
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:24,920
Please be happy.

452
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,360
Oh, Eun! Grab him!

453
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,650
There's no need for that.

454
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:59,430
I will go there on my own.

455
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,010
Aren't we getting married?

456
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:09,630
We have to hurry! We'll be late.

457
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:22,070
I have prepared five rolls of fine
cloth and fabric for you, Sister-in-law.

458
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:24,930
Please make my brother happy
with some good clothes.

459
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:29,370
These are pearls.
I hope you are blessed with children.

460
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:34,770
Use this bronze mirror and
live a pure married life, Eun.

461
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,570
This is silver, Eun.

462
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,190
"Hyun Hyun Yeok Saek."

463
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:48,110
It means that the kindness of heart
is what's important in a marriage

464
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,440
not the appearance.

465
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,820
Therefore, all of this is an added bonus.

466
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,440
I will use them all well.

467
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:58,670
Our 10th brother has married well.

468
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:01,440
That cold girl. Is she that happy?

469
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:05,340
If she smiles any wider,
her mouth will tear apart.

470
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:11,160
I have sent a tree that blooms flowers
and bears fruits to your home.

471
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:16,310
You can enjoy its shade in the
summer and enjoy its fruit in the fall.

472
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:19,280
Once it grows leaves,
I will invite you all over.

473
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,630
It would be perfect to
wrestle in the shade.

474
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:24,350
Why would you wrestle a bride?

475
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:25,910
You want to lose to me again?

476
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:32,260
You should do it! Wrestle! Try it.

477
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:14,420
Soo!

478
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,350
Are you all right? Soo!

479
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:22,020
Be careful of Prince Wang So.

480
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,200
Be careful of Prince Wang So.

481
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,580
Avoid him.

482
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,160
You cannot try to stop him.
If you do...

483
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:34,920
You will all die if you do.

484
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:38,300
Look at me. Look at me, Soo.

485
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:42,230
What are you talking about?
What do you mean we'll die?

486
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:45,090
I want to leave this place.

487
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,950
I want to go far away from the palace,
wherever that is.

488
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:01,100
All right, let's do that.

489
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,710
I'll do that for you.

490
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,170
Don't worry, Soo. Calm down.

491
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:08,750
You'll  be all right, Soo.

492
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:21,810
Listen!

493
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:23,810
We may be married but

494
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,880
I cannot acknowledge you as my wife.

495
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,250
Therefore, I'll continue to live the way I've always lived in,

496
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:33,220
so don't think about nagging at all.

497
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:35,220
Understood?

498
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,260
You should answer me
when I ask you a question!

499
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,200
This is so frustrating!

500
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:47,670
As you and I have tied the knot,
I will follow your will

501
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:52,370
so that our matrimony will be
long lasting and harmonious.

502
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:54,340
You don't talk much,

503
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,410
and when you do,
you use words I don't understand.

504
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:58,680
How am I going to grow fond of you?

505
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:00,680
I need a large bed!

506
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,180
Very large bed!

507
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:17,390
You said I'd only have to wait
until the first snow...

508
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:24,730
Hae Soo, you're such a mean liar.

509
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:48,700
Be careful of Wang So?

510
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,310
You cannot try to stop him...

511
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,390
Be careful of Wang So.

512
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:00,010
You cannot try to stop him.

513
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:16,090
The reason I asked to see you two
was to assign new tasks to you.

514
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:20,380
3rd Prince Yo,
I need you to leave Songak.

515
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:23,150
Visit every region and
inspect the grain storehouses.

516
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:28,290
There are many of the storehouses.

517
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:30,930
I know there are many thieves
that are attacking them.

518
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:35,170
Last year, the general in charge of
the storehouses came back dead.

519
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:37,300
That is why I am sending you.

520
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:40,850
A prince must step forward
in order for things to change.

521
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,130
Keep your group small.

522
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,990
I will accept your command.

523
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:55,210
Your Majesty, what about the military
supplies the 3rd Prince was in charge of?

524
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:58,860
I will put 4th Prince So in charge of it.

525
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:04,980
I accept your orders, Your Majesty.

526
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:15,880
Is the king throwing me away?

527
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,710
What? I doubt that.

528
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:22,100
He would assign a hard task
to a person he trusts more.

529
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,030
You said something
when you gave my seat to So.

530
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:30,900
Because of a father's favoritism,
two sons are tearing each other apart.

531
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:34,660
Is this the will of heaven as well?

532
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:37,980
You've had greed for what belongs to
the Crown Prince since you were young.

533
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:43,480
Now you must find
your place in the world.

534
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:45,550
Then keep your eye on me.

535
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:49,010
Watch and see where
my place ends up being.

536
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:19,260
We only want to have a family meal.
Why is it so surprising?

537
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,860
Isn't that right, Mother?

538
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,380
How nice it is to see your bare face.

539
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:29,050
You now have the king's trust.
I am proud of you.

540
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:32,120
I have waited so long
for a day like this.

541
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:35,000
Let's forget the past.

542
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,170
Let us eat. Eat.

543
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,340
This is my first time
eating with you, So.

544
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:51,430
I was already in Shinju
when you were born.

545
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:55,120
We should forget the past mistakes
and see each other often as brothers.

546
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,310
Yes, Yo.

547
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,960
You liked meat very much
when you were young.

548
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,990
I still like it very much.

549
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:20,550
Eat up.

550
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:50,040
You are taking on Yo's job.
You have much to learn.

551
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,070
I will have to leave Songak.

552
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:53,890
It is best to learn
from the Crown Prince.

553
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:54,920
I will do that.

554
00:51:54,930 --> 00:51:58,560
Then you'll have many opportunities
to see the Crown Prince.

555
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,960
There will be times when it
will be just the two of you.

556
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,480
What?

557
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:12,470
Of course.

558
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:16,150
There was something you wanted from me.

559
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:17,920
Kill the Crown Prince.

560
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,140
It wouldn't be the first time
you've killed someone for me.

561
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:30,910
Will you do it?

562
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:35,290
Mother, you shouldn't say
such things, even as a joke.

563
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:39,610
Has there been a king who hasn't killed
his brothers after rising to the throne?

564
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:43,510
If I do not become the king,
we are all dead.

565
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:45,740
We have to make a move.

566
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:49,040
The Crown Prince is not like that.
He would not kill his brothers.

567
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:58,010
Is that what you really want?

568
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:00,480
I want it.

569
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:04,340
Then... I will do it.

570
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:06,970
After I do...

571
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,920
I will sit on the throne.

572
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,090
What?

573
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:15,500
You want a son of yours to become king.

574
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,180
It shouldn't matter if it is me.

575
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:22,650
Once I am on the throne...
I will not harm Yo or Jung.

576
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,520
Don't act like you're so great.

577
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:29,700
If I had performed the rain ritual,
I would be the one who brought rain.

578
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,350
You think you can eye the throne
over something like that?

579
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,310
I have the heavens' will.

580
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,730
You have nothing except your in-laws.

581
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:40,960
The Crown Prince has lowly in-laws.

582
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:43,020
So, do you agree that
he should be removed?

583
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:46,550
Your brother is blessed
by the heavens to become king.

584
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:48,590
Who do you think you are dealing with?

585
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:55,660
You are all making
such a fuss over a joke.

586
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:58,080
I keep getting other ideas in my head.

587
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,660
King?

588
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:09,060
That seat that everyone wants so much,
what if I happened to take it?

589
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:15,810
You think you can do anything
because of a few brush strokes.

590
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:21,890
Do you really think
you've become something?

591
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:24,930
You were chosen for the rain ritual.

592
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:27,550
They felt that it'd be all right
for you to be beaten to death

593
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:28,750
instead of the Crown Prince.

594
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:32,090
You were a shield for any arrows or
misfortune that would've come his way.

595
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:34,810
You had no idea that your father
had manipulated you.

596
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:39,480
I was not manipulated.

597
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,230
I knew and crawled into that seat.

598
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:53,380
The food I ate here was not so bad.

599
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,350
Still, you should just eat
with your family.

600
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:57,840
Do not call me in here again.

601
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:15,250
As I thought, it is too difficult
to reconcile with him.

602
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,180
We will need to cut ties.

603
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:20,780
You are all too much.

604
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:24,170
You ask him to murder a person
at a family dinner?

605
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:26,410
If you were going to raise us as enemies

606
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:28,030
why did you give birth to us, Mother?

607
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,380
What is he saying...

608
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,180
Jung!

609
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,240
How foolish.

610
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:08,360
What were you expecting?

611
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,630
Soo.

612
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:49,310
Please let me go.

613
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:50,520
Just for a moment.

614
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:54,030
Stay with me.

615
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,240
I need to rest.

616
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,520
I don't want to!

617
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:07,380
I'm afraid of you, Your Highness.

618
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:14,290
You said you were not afraid of me.

619
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,390
I thought I could change things.

620
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:19,440
I was wrong.

621
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,470
You will ruin everyone in the end!

622
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:26,150
Go. You're better off far away!

623
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:27,690
Not you too!

624
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:37,740
Don't push me away.

625
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:39,600
Don't tell me leave.

626
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:44,610
Don't tell me that I bring misfortune
and that I'm an animal.

627
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,580
At the very least,
you can't do that to me.

628
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,890
You are... my person.

629
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:00,390
I am not your person, Your Highness.

630
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:02,200
You are my person.

631
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,770
You belong to me. You are mine!

632
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:10,710
Without my permission,
you cannot leave me.

633
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,270
You cannot die either.

634
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:17,960
You are completely my person.
