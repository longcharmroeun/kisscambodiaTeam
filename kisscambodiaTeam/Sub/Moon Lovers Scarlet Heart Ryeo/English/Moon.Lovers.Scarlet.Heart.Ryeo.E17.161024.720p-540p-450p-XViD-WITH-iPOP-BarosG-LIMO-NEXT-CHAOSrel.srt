<i>[Episode 17]</i>

4
00:00:10,513 --> 00:00:12,642
You said you didn't need the throne

5
00:00:12,642 --> 00:00:16,079
as long as we were together.

6
00:00:17,213 --> 00:00:19,749
You're not saying it anymore.

7
00:00:20,913 --> 00:00:23,720
We agreed not to lie to each other.

8
00:00:25,753 --> 00:00:28,055
I started this to end this vicious cycle

9
00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:31,361
of brother killing brother.

10
00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:34,095
Then,

11
00:00:34,593 --> 00:00:37,333
working on the construction
of the new capital,

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,469
I've learned that a new king

13
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:42,805
means a new world.

14
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,712
If being king means 

15
00:00:50,113 --> 00:00:53,149
I'll no longer be a dog on a leash

16
00:00:53,943 --> 00:00:56,886
and be able to end
all the tragedies,

17
00:00:57,253 --> 00:00:59,554
I definitely want to become this king. 

18
00:01:05,163 --> 00:01:09,299
What is it?
You don't want me to be king?

19
00:01:09,923 --> 00:01:11,473
I do not like it.

20
00:01:14,503 --> 00:01:16,633
However, I dislike being
apart from you even more.

21
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:21,763
Thank you.

22
00:01:24,633 --> 00:01:26,553
You will become king.

23
00:01:28,073 --> 00:01:29,253
I know it.

24
00:01:33,943 --> 00:01:36,133
Still, you must never...

25
00:01:37,463 --> 00:01:40,863
You must never ever harm your brothers.

26
00:01:43,293 --> 00:01:45,132
Can you promise me that?

27
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:07,657
It's Prince Wang So!

28
00:02:07,657 --> 00:02:09,023
There's an army coming!

29
00:02:09,353 --> 00:02:11,659
Close the palace gates!

30
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:37,063
You... what are you hiding from me?

31
00:02:38,013 --> 00:02:40,243
Have you poisoned the tea or something?

32
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,533
No, Your Majesty.

33
00:02:42,023 --> 00:02:44,063
The court lady has already
had a sip and tested it.

34
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:51,183
Now that I am in this state
and have given it some thought...

35
00:02:54,143 --> 00:02:56,223
everything started with you.

36
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:00,563
Pardon me?

37
00:03:01,213 --> 00:03:04,383
Moo, Eun, and Eun's wife.

38
00:03:05,273 --> 00:03:07,013
Even King Taejo.

39
00:03:08,613 --> 00:03:11,853
All of those dead people
are bothering me.

40
00:03:13,073 --> 00:03:15,373
It is all your fault.

41
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:22,093
I made the decision to kill
my brothers and become king.

42
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:25,683
All because you...

43
00:03:27,513 --> 00:03:31,183
helped So cover up his scar
and take my seat.

44
00:03:32,793 --> 00:03:35,283
Because he took what was mine...

45
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,383
Your Majesty!

46
00:03:57,803 --> 00:03:58,933
Yo!

47
00:03:59,663 --> 00:04:02,136
So is...
So is coming to the palace!

48
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:07,710
Wang So is revolting against you!

49
00:04:18,513 --> 00:04:20,323
Yo, Yo...

50
00:04:22,003 --> 00:04:23,373
You need to write this now.

51
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:25,893
Write down that you will be
abdicating the throne to Jung.

52
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,003
Hurry, now.

53
00:04:30,373 --> 00:04:31,393
What?

54
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:34,553
We cannot lose the throne.

55
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,143
Hurry. Write down that
Jung is to be the new king.

56
00:04:38,953 --> 00:04:41,753
Then we can plan for the future. Go on.

57
00:04:45,683 --> 00:04:49,033
Then... what about me?

58
00:04:53,873 --> 00:04:55,653
Am I even your son?

59
00:04:58,393 --> 00:05:00,253
What am I to you, Mother?

60
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:06,013
Just something that exists
to sit on the throne?

61
00:05:09,523 --> 00:05:14,483
Do you no longer have any need
for a son who isn't the king anymore?

62
00:05:16,363 --> 00:05:18,803
Yo, don't be this way.

63
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:22,203
We will lose everything if you do this.

64
00:05:22,203 --> 00:05:24,283
Hand it over to Jung, please.

65
00:05:30,453 --> 00:05:32,583
Now I think I understand So.

66
00:05:33,973 --> 00:05:35,913
I can relate to how he feels.

67
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:40,723
Take the Queen Mother out of here!

68
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:42,493
Yo.

69
00:05:43,613 --> 00:05:46,933
Yo, don't do this. Yo, Yo!

70
00:05:47,573 --> 00:05:50,083
Yo! Let go of me. Let me go, at once!

71
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,723
Let go. Yo!

72
00:05:52,043 --> 00:05:53,263
Yo!

73
00:05:53,763 --> 00:05:56,763
Let me go! Yo!

74
00:06:26,323 --> 00:06:28,713
I cannot reach Wook yet.

75
00:06:29,103 --> 00:06:30,773
Park Soo Kyung is with So.

76
00:06:30,773 --> 00:06:32,513
The palace men will not last long.

77
00:06:35,683 --> 00:06:36,803
Mother?

78
00:06:40,203 --> 00:06:44,513
Depending on what you decide,
I will go along with you.

79
00:06:46,243 --> 00:06:48,133
I knew after I saw your brother.

80
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:51,073
I knew what I forgot to teach you.

81
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:57,893
If you want to own the palace,
you must sacrifice something.

82
00:07:00,323 --> 00:07:01,533
Mother.

83
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:02,853
You must decide now.

84
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:06,023
You can have the
whole world and lose love.

85
00:07:06,023 --> 00:07:09,773
You can have love and
live in a very small world.

86
00:07:13,163 --> 00:07:16,823
What if I were to want the whole world?

87
00:07:22,553 --> 00:07:26,473
I... will throw Wook away.

88
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:47,673
I have come to attack the very palace
that I have always protected.

89
00:08:27,803 --> 00:08:32,875
I will help you enter the palace
without any bloodshed.

90
00:08:37,973 --> 00:08:40,449
I will not forget your loyalty.

91
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:55,113
I knew that he would
end up getting everything.

92
00:08:59,363 --> 00:09:03,983
What did I do so wrong?

93
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:08,833
I was afraid that I would
be thrown away, as well.

94
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,793
Just like So was.

95
00:09:11,793 --> 00:09:14,153
I thought I would be cast off.

96
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:26,353
Mother said to me...

97
00:09:27,163 --> 00:09:31,683
She said I was complete
and not lacking in anything.

98
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,623
Yet...

99
00:09:40,403 --> 00:09:42,363
it is all because of you.

100
00:09:43,703 --> 00:09:46,053
Because you got involved, you wench!

101
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:53,263
You should choose.

102
00:10:04,693 --> 00:10:06,723
Who should I give the throne to?

103
00:10:08,213 --> 00:10:09,333
Choose.

104
00:10:09,953 --> 00:10:11,103
Wook?

105
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:14,423
Baek Ah or So?

106
00:10:16,163 --> 00:10:18,963
You're so great. Why don't you choose?

107
00:10:25,253 --> 00:10:26,913
<i>Find the king now!</i>

108
00:10:26,913 --> 00:10:27,993
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

109
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,263
<i>I was only...</i>

110
00:11:27,193 --> 00:11:28,923
<i>trying to survive.</i>

111
00:12:19,243 --> 00:12:20,303
Did you read it?

112
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:53,773
<i>Move!</i>

113
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,173
<i>I told you to move! Move!</i>

114
00:13:15,983 --> 00:13:17,023
Yo.

115
00:13:37,803 --> 00:13:40,043
Greetings to the new king.

116
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:44,003
Long, long...

117
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:47,103
may he live.

118
00:13:55,823 --> 00:13:57,173
What do you mean "king"?

119
00:13:59,193 --> 00:14:00,483
What do you mean "king"!

120
00:14:00,483 --> 00:14:05,143
His Majesty gave me the throne
before he passed away.

121
00:14:10,843 --> 00:14:12,363
He abdicated to me.

122
00:14:18,213 --> 00:14:19,603
What?

123
00:14:19,603 --> 00:14:21,803
Greetings to you, Your Majesty.

124
00:14:22,553 --> 00:14:24,773
Greetings to the king.

125
00:14:24,773 --> 00:14:28,453
Long live the king.

126
00:15:28,343 --> 00:15:30,273
His Majesty, the king.

127
00:15:30,273 --> 00:15:34,043
Long live the king!

128
00:15:36,063 --> 00:15:38,323
His Majesty, the king.

129
00:15:38,743 --> 00:15:42,643
Long live the king!

130
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:57,353
<i>Gwangjong.</i>

131
00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:02,593
<i>He is the 4th King of Goryeo.</i>

132
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:04,023
<i>He is Gwangjong.</i>

133
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:11,373
<i>Now, you will no longer be remembered
in history as a bloody monarch.</i>

134
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,943
<i>I will help you.</i>

135
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:26,323
<i>Now, the Hwangbo household will use our
power to push for a queen, not a king.</i>

136
00:16:27,913 --> 00:16:31,153
<i>I was very upset to see
how much you had changed.</i>

137
00:16:31,663 --> 00:16:34,133
<i>The further you go astray,
the more you will suffer.</i>

138
00:16:35,423 --> 00:16:37,663
<i>It is better to distance yourself
from the royal family.</i>

139
00:16:46,203 --> 00:16:48,843
Why didn't you come to the coronation?

140
00:16:48,843 --> 00:16:51,133
What if people get the wrong idea?

141
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:53,213
When I arrived in Seokyeong

142
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:57,243
Wang Shik Ryeom had already died.

143
00:16:59,363 --> 00:17:03,253
So's men immediately placed me under
house arrest until I was released.

144
00:17:04,283 --> 00:17:06,543
But the owner of the throne
had already changed.

145
00:17:09,093 --> 00:17:12,413
A rebel who brings down one who
committed treason becomes a hero.

146
00:17:13,823 --> 00:17:15,713
It was the seat that I wanted...

147
00:17:16,863 --> 00:17:18,453
and Wang So was sitting on it.

148
00:17:21,413 --> 00:17:23,083
You wanted me to go see that.

149
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,893
Isn't that too cruel?

150
00:17:30,313 --> 00:17:31,943
Help me.

151
00:17:31,943 --> 00:17:36,933
I will become queen and repay you
for that pain you are going through.

152
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:41,103
I will share that burden you have
been carrying by yourself all this time.

153
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:46,413
Give me strength, Wook. Please?

154
00:18:03,613 --> 00:18:06,415
Moving the capital to Seokyung... 

155
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:15,121
Issue a decree that it is completely canceled.

156
00:18:15,121 --> 00:18:18,293
The forced laborers
displaced by this construction

157
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,029
will be repaid according to
the duration of their service

158
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:23,496
and returned to their homelands. 

159
00:18:24,093 --> 00:18:26,463
What about those that died in service?

160
00:18:26,463 --> 00:18:28,470
Do whatever their families want.

161
00:18:29,113 --> 00:18:30,672
Guarantee them jobs

162
00:18:30,706 --> 00:18:32,474
or compensate them with goods.

163
00:18:33,703 --> 00:18:36,111
Do the same for those who got injured.

164
00:18:37,113 --> 00:18:38,547
Then... 

165
00:18:38,547 --> 00:18:40,749
are we done for the night?

166
00:18:40,749 --> 00:18:41,483
Yes.

167
00:18:41,783 --> 00:18:43,049
Your Majesty.

168
00:18:43,443 --> 00:18:46,054
Damiwon's Court Lady Hae is
waiting for you.

169
00:18:46,253 --> 00:18:48,555
Hae Soo is?

170
00:19:24,453 --> 00:19:25,927
Soo?

171
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:36,938
You're back.

172
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:50,417
I'm sorry for making you
wait for so long.

173
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:54,087
Here.

174
00:19:55,383 --> 00:19:57,691
Here, you like this, right?

175
00:19:59,483 --> 00:20:00,863
Your grace is overflowing, Your Majesty.

176
00:20:01,593 --> 00:20:04,299
Stop that. It's just us here.

177
00:20:04,593 --> 00:20:05,934
Just address me as your brother.

178
00:20:06,293 --> 00:20:09,571
Only you deserve to do that.

179
00:20:09,813 --> 00:20:11,813
Yes, Your Majesty.

180
00:20:11,813 --> 00:20:13,475
Your Majesty?

181
00:20:30,183 --> 00:20:31,723
Thank you very much, Your Majesty.

182
00:20:39,563 --> 00:20:41,563
Sit down, sit down.

183
00:20:45,707 --> 00:20:50,078
This is nice. I really like this.

184
00:20:50,543 --> 00:20:55,217
I'd been waiting to have
a family meal

185
00:20:55,813 --> 00:20:57,113
together with you two.

186
00:20:57,113 --> 00:20:59,321
Yes, we understand.
You should eat now.

187
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:01,323
If you keep making me talk
when I'm hungry,

188
00:21:01,323 --> 00:21:04,025
I won't share a meal with you again.

189
00:21:07,123 --> 00:21:10,165
Alright. Let's eat.

190
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:46,099
Soo!

191
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,443
I thought you were gone...

192
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:08,087
I'll leave after you fall asleep.

193
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,360
It's been a long day for you.

194
00:22:23,113 --> 00:22:25,603
Why bother going back and forth?

195
00:22:25,607 --> 00:22:28,043
Just sleep with me.

196
00:22:48,613 --> 00:22:49,798
Why?

197
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:51,733
You just became king.

198
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:54,169
I don't want bad rumors to form.

199
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:56,333
I'll come back tomorrow.

200
00:23:02,343 --> 00:23:05,547
I need you here.

201
00:23:06,513 --> 00:23:09,451
I just don't feel comfortable here.

202
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:11,743
Maybe because I've seen the previous owners die.

203
00:23:15,423 --> 00:23:17,423
Just thinking about being here alone

204
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:21,730
makes me feel suffocated.

205
00:23:22,263 --> 00:23:24,564
Stay here with me. Please?

206
00:23:26,293 --> 00:23:28,601
Stay with me.

207
00:23:40,473 --> 00:23:42,484
Tell me a story?

208
00:23:42,484 --> 00:23:45,487
We're nowhere near a thousand yet. 

209
00:23:50,823 --> 00:23:53,326
Well... you can't see
the stars from here...

210
00:23:54,223 --> 00:23:56,223
Ah, maybe a story about you,
Your Majesty?

211
00:23:57,423 --> 00:24:00,502
A story about me?

212
00:24:01,202 --> 00:24:06,608
A Big Bad Wolf eats this girl
called the Little Red Riding Hood.

213
00:24:11,073 --> 00:24:13,379
Once upon a time,

214
00:24:13,982 --> 00:24:17,953
there was this cute little girl

215
00:24:17,953 --> 00:24:20,488
with big eyes like me,

216
00:24:20,488 --> 00:24:22,783
<i> sent by her mom to take food
to her grandmother... </i>

217
00:25:06,113 --> 00:25:08,534
Even after just one day,

218
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:12,173
I realized how naive I'd been.

219
00:25:12,473 --> 00:25:15,844
I wanted him to become king
because waiting was so hard.

220
00:25:16,443 --> 00:25:19,814
but now it seems like
I'll have to wait even longer.

221
00:25:19,814 --> 00:25:22,113
You need to be careful with your words.

222
00:25:23,385 --> 00:25:27,113
Since Princess Gyeonghwagung has become a nun,

223
00:25:27,113 --> 00:25:29,122
the position of the queen is practically empty.

224
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:34,113
People will try to pull you down,
so be careful.

225
00:25:34,613 --> 00:25:37,433
Court Lady! Court Lady!

226
00:25:37,433 --> 00:25:38,633
Chae Ryung.

227
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:46,563
Court Lady Hae,
Queen Yoo wishes to see you.

228
00:26:10,043 --> 00:26:11,803
Hello, Queen Yoo.

229
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:14,083
I called you here because
I have a question for you.

230
00:26:16,873 --> 00:26:17,933
Jung.

231
00:26:19,993 --> 00:26:22,823
This was found in the late king's room.

232
00:26:24,063 --> 00:26:26,453
It looks like a last decree.

233
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:31,083
I am certain it pertains
to the succession of the throne.

234
00:26:31,933 --> 00:26:36,833
If so, that means it may not be
So's name that is written there.

235
00:26:39,023 --> 00:26:40,163
Tell me.

236
00:26:41,003 --> 00:26:44,473
Did the late king really
abdicate the throne to So?

237
00:26:47,723 --> 00:26:51,333
If you cannot say anything out of fear,
we can protect you.

238
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:53,143
So you need to be honest.

239
00:26:55,093 --> 00:27:00,623
Is it true that the late king
abdicated his throne to So?

240
00:27:07,033 --> 00:27:08,503
Yes, it is true.

241
00:27:08,503 --> 00:27:11,243
Lies. You are lying.

242
00:27:13,053 --> 00:27:14,583
I know Yo.

243
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,613
No one knows him better than I do.

244
00:27:18,323 --> 00:27:20,913
He would never give the throne to So.

245
00:27:22,413 --> 00:27:25,273
Tell me. Tell me the truth!

246
00:27:25,273 --> 00:27:27,383
- Mother.
- Tell me, tell me!

247
00:27:27,383 --> 00:27:29,403
- Tell me!
- That's enough!

248
00:27:43,463 --> 00:27:44,653
Stop that now.

249
00:27:45,193 --> 00:27:47,953
You can ask me about it,
so why bother her?

250
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:50,113
Is that so?

251
00:27:50,933 --> 00:27:53,083
Then why don't you tell me the truth?

252
00:27:54,543 --> 00:27:56,303
Why did you rip up the decree?

253
00:27:56,303 --> 00:27:58,343
Who says that I ripped it?

254
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:06,133
I do not know why Yo ripped it
and only left a dying wish.

255
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:08,823
He abdicated the throne to me
and there is no doubt about that.

256
00:28:12,203 --> 00:28:15,583
He has a son so why would he
leave it to his younger brother?

257
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:19,623
If you are so curious,
do you want to ask him in the afterlife?

258
00:28:20,403 --> 00:28:22,403
It's a good thing that he did abdicate.

259
00:28:22,403 --> 00:28:25,143
What would it have been like
if I were forced to usurp the throne?

260
00:28:25,973 --> 00:28:27,843
Right about now...

261
00:28:28,443 --> 00:28:30,853
the palace would be filled
with blood of Jung

262
00:28:30,853 --> 00:28:34,113
and my slaughtered brothers and nephews.

263
00:28:40,383 --> 00:28:44,773
Queen Mother, why don't you work on
the memorial service for the late king?

264
00:28:46,093 --> 00:28:48,473
I will visit you often
to see how you are.

265
00:28:48,473 --> 00:28:50,143
Do not call me Queen Mother.

266
00:28:52,463 --> 00:28:56,163
I do not wish to be called Queen Mother
because you are sitting on the throne.

267
00:28:56,163 --> 00:28:58,303
I am your son too, Mother.

268
00:28:59,053 --> 00:29:03,453
If your son is the king,
you are automatically the Queen Mother.

269
00:29:03,453 --> 00:29:06,643
You are merely the thief
who stole my son's throne.

270
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:22,813
Tell my family in Chungju
that I want to see them.

271
00:29:35,203 --> 00:29:38,163
You do not need to go to them
even if they call for you.

272
00:29:39,303 --> 00:29:40,303
All right.

273
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:50,233
Whoever it is and whatever rank,
you need to get my permission first.

274
00:29:50,233 --> 00:29:51,303
All right?

275
00:29:51,303 --> 00:29:53,073
I understand.

276
00:29:57,903 --> 00:29:58,923
I...

277
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:19,063
Your Majesty, there are rumors
coming from all four directions.

278
00:30:19,393 --> 00:30:20,463
About what?

279
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:24,603
They believe that Lord Kyung Chun Won
should have been king.

280
00:30:24,603 --> 00:30:29,733
Foreign Minister Park Young Gyu thinks
you lied about the king's dying wish.

281
00:30:31,723 --> 00:30:32,893
Kill him.

282
00:30:34,063 --> 00:30:35,143
Excuse me?

283
00:30:35,143 --> 00:30:38,113
Charge anyone who submits
an appeal with treason.

284
00:30:40,433 --> 00:30:42,303
The late king's servants.

285
00:30:42,303 --> 00:30:45,883
Take care of all the court ladies and
soldiers that were in the Cheondeokjeon.

286
00:30:46,843 --> 00:30:48,883
Don't leave behind a single person

287
00:30:48,883 --> 00:30:51,853
who will cast doubt on
the succession of the throne.

288
00:30:55,173 --> 00:30:56,983
Not a single person.

289
00:30:58,253 --> 00:30:59,793
I won't leave anyone.

290
00:31:03,233 --> 00:31:06,153
The king is determined to catch me.

291
00:31:06,153 --> 00:31:09,373
You started a rumor that the king lied
about the late king's dying words.

292
00:31:09,373 --> 00:31:10,803
Did you think you would be safe?

293
00:31:10,823 --> 00:31:11,933
Is that right?

294
00:31:12,963 --> 00:31:15,303
Then I'd better expose the fact

295
00:31:15,303 --> 00:31:18,203
that you were spying on
the 4th Prince and Baek Ah.

296
00:31:18,973 --> 00:31:20,763
Do you think I will die alone?

297
00:31:21,453 --> 00:31:22,993
You ignorant girl.

298
00:31:54,973 --> 00:31:57,923
I haven't seen this in a long time.

299
00:31:57,923 --> 00:32:00,493
It has gotten quite dirty.
You need a new string.

300
00:32:02,873 --> 00:32:04,613
I don't want to lose it.

301
00:32:06,733 --> 00:32:08,303
You said you got it from your parents.

302
00:32:10,713 --> 00:32:14,343
I think I have to do something
your parents won't like very much.

303
00:32:15,873 --> 00:32:17,253
What is...

304
00:32:17,253 --> 00:32:19,213
Before we get married...

305
00:32:20,653 --> 00:32:25,053
I think we may need to get you registered
as an adopted daughter of a good family.

306
00:32:27,473 --> 00:32:32,283
It is because I'm
from Hubaekje, isn't it?

307
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,973
My grandmother still clearly remembers
the incidents that happened to Gyeon Hwan.

308
00:32:36,763 --> 00:32:39,063
Her family was killed in front of her.

309
00:32:39,713 --> 00:32:42,703
She tries to avoid dealing with people
from Hubaekje if she can.

310
00:32:43,883 --> 00:32:46,113
It happened before we were even born!

311
00:32:46,113 --> 00:32:47,829
As if Gyeon Hwon had something to do with you.

312
00:32:47,829 --> 00:32:49,829
<i>[Park Young Gyu]
You're Gyeon Gwon's granddaughter.</i>

313
00:32:50,073 --> 00:32:52,813
Still, let's avoid unnecessary trouble.

314
00:32:52,813 --> 00:32:55,336
I'll visit your parents' gravesite later
to apologize.

315
00:32:55,336 --> 00:32:57,113
<i>[Park Young Gyu]
If his connection with you is revealed,</i>

316
00:32:57,113 --> 00:32:59,373
<i>Prince Baek Ah won't be safe, either.</i>

317
00:32:59,373 --> 00:33:01,674
Is that alright with you?

318
00:33:03,244 --> 00:33:07,243
The king of Goryeo killed my parents,

319
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:15,056
and my king killed your family.

320
00:33:15,957 --> 00:33:21,729
With that, do you think
it's alright for us to be together?

321
00:33:22,063 --> 00:33:24,363
Woo Hee.

322
00:33:24,363 --> 00:33:26,363
it wasn't my fault,

323
00:33:27,301 --> 00:33:29,301
and it wasn't your fault, either.

324
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:36,775
Think only of the two of us.

325
00:33:37,303 --> 00:33:39,612
Unless you stop liking me,

326
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:44,185
we'll never be apart no matter what.

327
00:33:49,063 --> 00:33:50,803
I cannot allow it.

328
00:33:50,803 --> 00:33:54,713
I would like to rest now
and go back to my hometown.

329
00:33:55,403 --> 00:33:57,083
I need you more than ever.

330
00:33:58,093 --> 00:34:00,403
I do not understand why
you are insisting on leaving.

331
00:34:03,073 --> 00:34:05,243
If I am to be very honest...

332
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:10,213
I have become sick and tired
of this royal household.

333
00:34:12,933 --> 00:34:15,423
Every time I go back and forth

334
00:34:16,323 --> 00:34:18,003
my child...

335
00:34:19,673 --> 00:34:23,873
I see my visions of my child
and I hear her voice.

336
00:34:24,853 --> 00:34:27,743
I try my best to pretend
it is not the case.

337
00:34:27,743 --> 00:34:33,783
I cannot rid myself of the image of
you wielding your sword, Your Majesty.

338
00:34:35,923 --> 00:34:37,883
It has been very difficult.

339
00:34:40,963 --> 00:34:42,233
Do not leave.

340
00:34:43,563 --> 00:34:45,373
- Do not leave.
- Your Majesty.

341
00:34:46,093 --> 00:34:48,413
For the sake of this nation
and its people

342
00:34:49,743 --> 00:34:51,603
become a good and wise king.

343
00:34:52,373 --> 00:34:54,493
You have to be.

344
00:35:16,563 --> 00:35:18,523
Park Soo Kyung has left.

345
00:35:20,673 --> 00:35:22,853
He is sick and tired of this palace.

346
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:25,873
Now...

347
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:29,343
he is afraid of me.

348
00:35:35,713 --> 00:35:39,133
You are curious about whose name
the late king wrote in his last decree.

349
00:35:39,133 --> 00:35:40,583
Aren't you?

350
00:35:41,663 --> 00:35:45,323
You are wondering whether
I stole this throne or not.

351
00:35:45,323 --> 00:35:47,333
I do not think that at all.

352
00:35:48,393 --> 00:35:51,703
I am the person who is
least curious about that.

353
00:35:59,453 --> 00:36:00,773
It was blank.

354
00:36:11,693 --> 00:36:14,093
<i>No one's name was written there.</i>

355
00:36:15,643 --> 00:36:16,723
That is why...

356
00:36:18,263 --> 00:36:21,043
I ripped it up, knowing that
leaving a decree like that

357
00:36:21,043 --> 00:36:22,563
would cause more confusion.

358
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:27,963
I had already taken over the palace, anyway.

359
00:36:31,113 --> 00:36:33,113
You did the right thing.

360
00:36:33,113 --> 00:36:35,483
Park Soo Kyung has left me,

361
00:36:36,323 --> 00:36:38,959
and Baek Ah sees me only as his king

362
00:36:38,959 --> 00:36:40,953
and no longer a brother.

363
00:36:42,363 --> 00:36:44,363
For Choi Ji Mong, I'm just

364
00:36:44,632 --> 00:36:48,002
an avenger of
my oldest brother's death.

365
00:36:48,863 --> 00:36:51,572
Jung...

366
00:36:52,303 --> 00:36:57,473
sees me as a murderer of our brothers.

367
00:36:58,413 --> 00:37:01,649
Even my own mother

368
00:37:02,143 --> 00:37:05,052
sees me only as a thief.

369
00:37:12,223 --> 00:37:14,962
You were right.

370
00:37:16,593 --> 00:37:18,897
The throne...

371
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:21,367
makes you scared

372
00:37:23,763 --> 00:37:26,071
and lonely.

373
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:36,763
I am right here.

374
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,423
I will not leave you.

375
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:12,513
Wow! This is what
Cheondeokjeon looks like.

376
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:29,733
I... have a favor to ask you, Lady Hae.

377
00:38:33,313 --> 00:38:38,013
With the enthronement of the new king,
they are releasing some court ladies.

378
00:38:38,913 --> 00:38:40,543
I am included.

379
00:38:43,413 --> 00:38:45,723
I was told to leave the Damiwon.

380
00:38:47,393 --> 00:38:50,073
Then I guess I will not
be seeing you too often.

381
00:38:50,883 --> 00:38:52,373
Where will you be going?

382
00:38:54,023 --> 00:38:57,643
Lady Hae, can't you help me
just stay and live in the palace?

383
00:38:58,323 --> 00:39:00,603
Please ask the king for me.

384
00:39:08,883 --> 00:39:10,013
How did it go?

385
00:39:10,013 --> 00:39:13,033
She said she would ask the king.

386
00:39:14,723 --> 00:39:16,113
All right.

387
00:39:16,113 --> 00:39:17,993
You must remain in the Damiwon.

388
00:39:20,663 --> 00:39:23,813
Well, this is a chance.

389
00:39:25,473 --> 00:39:27,393
Can I not go to you, Your Highness?

390
00:39:28,863 --> 00:39:31,573
I don't know when I'll be
able to leave the palace again.

391
00:39:34,953 --> 00:39:38,993
Chae Ryung, there is still so much
you can do to help me here.

392
00:39:40,683 --> 00:39:43,943
When the time comes,
I will take you out of here.

393
00:39:57,783 --> 00:40:00,192
Does asking for autonomy mean that

394
00:40:00,783 --> 00:40:03,330
Chungju will no longer be a part of Goryeo?

395
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:05,323
Your claim to the throne is suspicious.

396
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:07,833
How could we serve you as our king?

397
00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:12,673
Loyalty can only come from trust.

398
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:18,279
I also grew up as Lord Yu Geung Dal's grandson.

399
00:40:18,473 --> 00:40:25,319
Even so, the whole family intends
to oppose me, the current king?

400
00:40:26,953 --> 00:40:29,354
You'll have to consider what other clans would think

401
00:40:29,953 --> 00:40:32,560
when the king isn't even supported

402
00:40:32,653 --> 00:40:34,762
by his own family. 

403
00:40:36,963 --> 00:40:39,264
Do you want to

404
00:40:39,264 --> 00:40:42,736
cut off our ties, Jung?

405
00:40:43,003 --> 00:40:45,472
If the late king's dying wishes become clearer,

406
00:40:46,063 --> 00:40:48,876
we'll know for sure.

407
00:40:59,653 --> 00:41:00,955
We have to do something with the Chungju Yu clan,

408
00:41:00,955 --> 00:41:02,183
or things will get dangerous.

409
00:41:02,183 --> 00:41:05,392
We either have to show them
what the late king's last words were,

410
00:41:05,392 --> 00:41:09,330
or form an alliance with other clans
that are just as powerful.

411
00:41:09,623 --> 00:41:12,700
Even to the end,

412
00:41:13,433 --> 00:41:14,963
I'm not her son.

413
00:41:34,254 --> 00:41:36,254
Woo Hee?

414
00:41:39,723 --> 00:41:41,795
I'm sure the king will love these.

415
00:41:41,795 --> 00:41:46,166
Is this too small a gift
in return for the new room?

416
00:41:49,163 --> 00:41:51,470
Soo,

417
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:55,609
if I wrong someone for my own happiness,

418
00:41:56,873 --> 00:42:00,247
it'll come back to me eventually, right?

419
00:42:01,081 --> 00:42:02,873
I wouldn't be forgiven.

420
00:42:02,873 --> 00:42:05,073
That's right.

421
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:09,056
You shouldn't hurt someone
to save your own life.

422
00:42:12,123 --> 00:42:14,426
However...

423
00:42:15,496 --> 00:42:20,134
I think you and I deserve some slack.

424
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:24,271
We've gone through a lot.

425
00:42:24,271 --> 00:42:27,675
The scars on our wrists.

426
00:42:28,609 --> 00:42:30,609
We just want a slice of happiness

427
00:42:31,779 --> 00:42:35,649
barely enough to cover those. 

428
00:42:35,649 --> 00:42:39,620
I think we may be forgiven

429
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:42,322
even if we acted a little more selfish.

430
00:42:42,322 --> 00:42:44,213
I'm going to believe that.

431
00:43:01,283 --> 00:43:03,223
Can you go on and put this in my room?

432
00:43:03,793 --> 00:43:04,913
Yes.

433
00:43:21,233 --> 00:43:25,103
You ended up going to him.

434
00:43:26,923 --> 00:43:31,703
You said that I was being greedy
for wanting both the throne and love.

435
00:43:32,563 --> 00:43:34,363
Now you are the king's woman.

436
00:43:35,553 --> 00:43:37,283
How am I to accept that?

437
00:43:40,723 --> 00:43:42,963
He was honest with me.

438
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:48,933
He told me he did not want
to lose either the throne or me.

439
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:53,143
He confessed it all to me,
even his greed.

440
00:43:55,543 --> 00:43:58,273
I had no choice
but to try and understand.

441
00:44:02,703 --> 00:44:04,043
I have always been curious.

442
00:44:04,733 --> 00:44:09,753
Why is it that you insisted
I could not become king?

443
00:44:10,813 --> 00:44:11,833
In your eyes...

444
00:44:13,023 --> 00:44:15,613
was I not enough to become king?

445
00:44:15,613 --> 00:44:17,813
- It is not like that.
- Then what?

446
00:44:24,853 --> 00:44:30,073
They say Prince Wang So was
born with the star of a king.

447
00:44:30,613 --> 00:44:32,683
King Taejo knew about that, as well.

448
00:44:34,443 --> 00:44:36,103
It is not your fault.

449
00:44:39,413 --> 00:44:41,693
It is only nature and it is fate.

450
00:44:44,883 --> 00:44:46,093
Star of a king?

451
00:44:49,123 --> 00:44:51,193
All because of a measly star?

452
00:44:53,183 --> 00:44:54,523
Nature...

453
00:44:56,263 --> 00:44:57,493
and fate?

454
00:45:17,743 --> 00:45:19,143
<i>Can you promise me?</i>

455
00:45:21,213 --> 00:45:22,653
<i>That you will never take it off.</i>

456
00:45:47,713 --> 00:45:49,223
<i>It is not your fault.</i>

457
00:45:49,723 --> 00:45:52,043
<i>It is only nature and it is fate. </i>

458
00:46:10,903 --> 00:46:14,573
You will become queen.

459
00:46:18,493 --> 00:46:21,233
You are going to help me?

460
00:46:23,153 --> 00:46:27,503
No one can have everything.

461
00:46:29,363 --> 00:46:31,573
Isn't that what is fair?

462
00:46:40,683 --> 00:46:43,753
<i>[When the water has run dry.
Sit and wait for the rising clouds.]</i>

463
00:46:43,753 --> 00:46:45,093
Finished.

464
00:46:52,913 --> 00:46:55,033
Why do you need me to
write so many of these?

465
00:46:55,033 --> 00:46:57,383
I have a purpose for it all.

466
00:46:59,563 --> 00:47:01,933
You said you would give me
something for preparing your room.

467
00:47:01,933 --> 00:47:03,523
All you gave me was herbal rice.

468
00:47:04,443 --> 00:47:07,583
You ate it all without leaving one grain.

469
00:47:07,583 --> 00:47:11,523
I was going to give some to Baek Ah
and Astronomer Choi Ji Mong, as well.

470
00:47:12,073 --> 00:47:14,773
There's no need for you
to think of others besides me.

471
00:47:17,313 --> 00:47:18,413
It's all mine.

472
00:47:23,613 --> 00:47:25,613
Did something happen today?

473
00:47:26,963 --> 00:47:29,423
No, why do you think that?

474
00:47:31,383 --> 00:47:33,513
You are smiling more than usual.

475
00:47:34,593 --> 00:47:36,363
It is making me worry. That's all.

476
00:47:43,463 --> 00:47:45,953
Don't try to know everything about me.

477
00:47:47,413 --> 00:47:51,693
If you keep doing that when we're not
even married, I'll want to run away.

478
00:47:51,693 --> 00:47:54,983
That's because I spend all day
waiting for you, Your Majesty.

479
00:47:56,313 --> 00:47:59,463
Can't I work in the Damiwon
during the day?

480
00:48:00,623 --> 00:48:04,403
Even if I don't serve people myself,
there are many other things to do.

481
00:48:08,293 --> 00:48:11,943
Also, about Chae Ryung...

482
00:48:12,943 --> 00:48:15,793
I heard she is being released as
a court lady from the Damiwon.

483
00:48:15,793 --> 00:48:18,313
Can't you let her stay?

484
00:48:20,553 --> 00:48:23,443
She really has no place to go
even if she leaves the palace.

485
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:26,873
Chae Ryung?

486
00:48:28,383 --> 00:48:29,683
I don't know.

487
00:48:29,683 --> 00:48:32,403
I need Chae Ryung so that I'm not lonely.

488
00:48:32,403 --> 00:48:34,403
Please, please?

489
00:48:38,423 --> 00:48:39,853
All right, all right.

490
00:48:41,653 --> 00:48:46,053
But... I do not think you will
be so lonely in the future.

491
00:48:49,133 --> 00:48:51,013
We will have to have
children and raise them.

492
00:48:53,233 --> 00:48:54,563
Children?

493
00:48:58,563 --> 00:49:00,473
A doctor will come to see you.

494
00:49:00,473 --> 00:49:03,433
You need to take care of yourself
physically in order to have children.

495
00:49:04,793 --> 00:49:06,923
We aren't even married yet.

496
00:49:06,923 --> 00:49:09,673
You're telling me take care of my health
and talking about babies.

497
00:49:09,673 --> 00:49:12,713
Marriage? We can get married.

498
00:49:12,713 --> 00:49:14,063
When should we do it?

499
00:49:14,933 --> 00:49:16,473
Let's do it when you want.

500
00:49:17,653 --> 00:49:20,223
No, I do not want to.

501
00:49:21,623 --> 00:49:22,693
You don't want to?

502
00:49:23,733 --> 00:49:26,063
You should do a better proposal.

503
00:49:27,443 --> 00:49:31,643
You said you had to speak to me
at the prayer tower.

504
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,053
Do you think I am stupid?

505
00:49:36,663 --> 00:49:38,723
You were going to propose
to me there, weren't you?

506
00:49:41,363 --> 00:49:43,853
I don't know when I can go there.

507
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:47,343
It isn't so simple to
leave the palace anymore.

508
00:49:49,733 --> 00:49:50,823
I see.

509
00:49:54,083 --> 00:49:58,573
Must I come up with a proposal
to satisfy you if I am to marry you?

510
00:50:01,753 --> 00:50:05,033
Dealing with you is harder
than dealing with the government.

511
00:50:30,943 --> 00:50:34,603
Whatever you need to say,
you can be honest with me.

512
00:50:35,513 --> 00:50:39,083
I will let the king know myself.

513
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:42,473
Your knee is not doing well.

514
00:50:42,953 --> 00:50:47,583
When you were tortured in the past,
it was not treated properly.

515
00:50:47,583 --> 00:50:49,273
Now it has become a chronic illness.

516
00:50:49,273 --> 00:50:52,963
You may be unable to walk someday.

517
00:50:52,963 --> 00:50:53,993
I see.

518
00:50:54,803 --> 00:50:56,673
I will watch out for that.

519
00:50:57,823 --> 00:51:00,183
However, there is something worse.

520
00:51:01,073 --> 00:51:02,383
It is your heart palpitations.

521
00:51:03,553 --> 00:51:05,233
Heart palpitations?

522
00:51:05,233 --> 00:51:09,453
When you are overexerted or startled,
does your chest feel stuffy?

523
00:51:09,453 --> 00:51:13,633
Have you ever felt so out of breath
that you have passed out?

524
00:51:13,633 --> 00:51:15,013
Yes, well...

525
00:51:15,013 --> 00:51:17,033
You have had pent-up frustration.

526
00:51:17,673 --> 00:51:21,083
The illness of your heart has
become an illness of the body.

527
00:51:21,633 --> 00:51:27,583
At this point, I cannot guarantee
how long you will live.

528
00:51:29,903 --> 00:51:31,923
You cannot guarantee it?

529
00:51:35,333 --> 00:51:37,243
I cannot live long?

530
00:51:44,563 --> 00:51:45,993
I am all right.

531
00:51:47,053 --> 00:51:50,343
Please tell me how long I will live.

532
00:52:05,313 --> 00:52:08,023
I will take good care of
my health from now on.

533
00:52:09,843 --> 00:52:11,593
I am only in my twenties.

534
00:52:13,513 --> 00:52:15,453
10 years is too severe.

535
00:52:17,643 --> 00:52:19,093
I will live a bit longer.

536
00:52:22,803 --> 00:52:23,883
With him...

537
00:52:27,193 --> 00:52:29,713
I want to be with him a little longer.

538
00:52:40,093 --> 00:52:41,953
What are you wishing so hard for?

539
00:52:44,983 --> 00:52:48,603
Are you praying for So
to be king for a long time?

540
00:52:49,793 --> 00:52:55,773
I am praying for the manly and kind
14th Prince to become my friend again.

541
00:52:56,793 --> 00:52:59,593
You said you would not
take anyone's side.

542
00:53:00,503 --> 00:53:02,513
However, you took my 4th brother's side.

543
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:04,113
I feel very betrayed.

544
00:53:06,713 --> 00:53:09,033
Do not misdirect your anger.

545
00:53:09,033 --> 00:53:11,833
Have you forgotten
what the late king did

546
00:53:11,833 --> 00:53:13,683
to your oldest brother
and the 10th Prince?

547
00:53:15,533 --> 00:53:20,233
It is only natural that
So became the king.

548
00:53:22,403 --> 00:53:25,203
Yes, you might be right.

549
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:28,973
However, I still believe that
everything started going wrong

550
00:53:28,973 --> 00:53:30,863
once So came to Songak.

551
00:53:31,553 --> 00:53:33,583
Fighting for the throne always existed.

552
00:53:33,583 --> 00:53:37,083
Once So got involved,
it became more complicated and brutal.

553
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:39,103
It is true that he
stole the throne, as well.

554
00:53:40,683 --> 00:53:43,093
I am worried that
everyone will be in danger.

555
00:53:44,413 --> 00:53:47,733
Do you think that you
could become the queen?

556
00:53:50,443 --> 00:53:51,803
Queen?

557
00:53:55,313 --> 00:53:56,493
I don't know.

558
00:53:57,753 --> 00:54:00,233
I haven't thought about it deeply.

559
00:54:00,233 --> 00:54:05,863
A queen must use her family's name and
the other families to support the king.

560
00:54:05,863 --> 00:54:09,723
That is why King Taejo
got married as often as he did.

561
00:54:10,803 --> 00:54:15,803
At this rate, you will just be
one of the king's many women.

562
00:54:15,803 --> 00:54:18,103
Is this really how you wanted to live?

563
00:54:18,103 --> 00:54:22,273
What about riding camels in the desert
and going to oceans in faraway lands?

564
00:54:22,273 --> 00:54:23,683
Weren't you just saying that?

565
00:54:29,233 --> 00:54:31,663
Tell me whenever
you get tired of this place.

566
00:54:32,803 --> 00:54:34,393
If you really want to leave...

567
00:54:35,503 --> 00:54:37,583
I do have a way out.

568
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:41,940
I will keep that in mind.

569
00:55:06,593 --> 00:55:09,913
<i>The 8th Prince is here to see His Majesty!</i>

570
00:55:20,833 --> 00:55:21,943
Good to see you.

571
00:55:23,243 --> 00:55:26,283
I'm here on behalf of
all other court officials.

572
00:55:29,213 --> 00:55:30,893
On their behalf?

573
00:55:30,893 --> 00:55:31,933
First.

574
00:55:34,393 --> 00:55:37,823
we want the commander of the
300 thousand government troops

575
00:55:37,823 --> 00:55:40,463
to be determined by the vote
of only the court officials.

576
00:55:41,913 --> 00:55:42,983
Second.

577
00:55:43,643 --> 00:55:47,023
the clans of each region will manage
the local tax collection offices.

578
00:55:48,133 --> 00:55:50,563
We'll send a set amount to the royal family,

579
00:55:50,563 --> 00:55:54,193
but the rest will be free to use for each clan.

580
00:55:57,253 --> 00:55:58,485
As long as you agree to this,

581
00:55:58,485 --> 00:56:00,523
you'll have more company in this court.

582
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,993
Give up the military and the revenue?

583
00:56:04,263 --> 00:56:06,793
You mean to cut off both wings of the king.

584
00:56:09,023 --> 00:56:11,813
If you think such threats
will work on me,

585
00:56:12,883 --> 00:56:14,093
you are mistaken.

586
00:56:15,253 --> 00:56:17,243
If you don't want to give up your wings,

587
00:56:19,483 --> 00:56:21,153
how about your heart?

588
00:56:23,083 --> 00:56:26,923
The Hwangbo clan of Hwangju
propose a marriage to the king!

589
00:56:36,513 --> 00:56:37,973
It is a nice room.

590
00:56:38,673 --> 00:56:39,873
You have decorated it well.

591
00:56:39,873 --> 00:56:42,443
Please say what it is you came to say.

592
00:56:43,013 --> 00:56:44,873
I will only listen for today.

593
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:48,253
I did not come to fight.

594
00:56:50,353 --> 00:56:53,963
I came to make it clear
what it is that you and I want.

595
00:56:53,963 --> 00:56:57,483
I did not realize that we had anything
more to give or take from each other.

596
00:56:58,863 --> 00:57:02,783
I do not want anything
from you, Princess.

597
00:57:02,783 --> 00:57:06,373
You may continue to
stay here if you wish to.

598
00:57:06,373 --> 00:57:09,293
I am saying that I will accept you
as the king's woman.

599
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:12,533
You will not be a royal concubine.

600
00:57:12,533 --> 00:57:16,733
I won't get involved in who takes
care of the king all day and night.

601
00:57:18,503 --> 00:57:20,263
I do not know what you're referring to.

602
00:57:21,583 --> 00:57:23,073
I don't understand.

603
00:57:23,073 --> 00:57:25,523
What I want is honor and recognition.

604
00:57:26,133 --> 00:57:29,713
Also, I want my son on the throne.

605
00:57:31,873 --> 00:57:34,433
I will be marrying the king.

606
00:57:35,473 --> 00:57:37,483
I will be the king's wife.

607
00:57:41,623 --> 00:57:45,133
I will be the queen.

608
00:57:50,823 --> 00:57:55,393
If you marry Yeon Hwa,
all the families will be on your side.

609
00:57:56,533 --> 00:57:58,873
The Hwangbos will become your strength.

610
00:57:58,873 --> 00:58:01,173
Do not try to shake me in this way.

611
00:58:01,803 --> 00:58:03,443
I may be on the throne.

612
00:58:04,193 --> 00:58:06,893
But I still have the
temper of a wolf dog.

613
00:58:08,283 --> 00:58:12,563
You are sitting in a seat that is
hard to get and even harder to protect.

614
00:58:14,093 --> 00:58:17,573
From where you are sitting
it will be very clear to you

615
00:58:17,573 --> 00:58:20,723
that the powerful families
are a double-edged sword.

616
00:58:22,633 --> 00:58:24,913
If you want to sit there for a long time

617
00:58:24,913 --> 00:58:26,893
you need them on your side.

618
00:58:34,003 --> 00:58:36,733
I have promised to marry someone else.

619
00:58:38,183 --> 00:58:40,163
Are you referring to Hae Soo?

620
00:58:42,433 --> 00:58:46,473
That girl cannot become a queen.

621
00:58:50,613 --> 00:58:52,203
If I say I will do it...

622
00:58:53,743 --> 00:58:54,843
I will do it.

623
00:58:54,843 --> 00:58:56,393
You must have forgotten.

624
00:58:57,143 --> 00:59:01,113
In order to avoid marrying
the late King Taejo

625
00:59:02,403 --> 00:59:04,343
she cut her own arm.

626
00:59:07,013 --> 00:59:08,803
A woman with a scar on her body

627
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:12,663
cannot marry the king.
