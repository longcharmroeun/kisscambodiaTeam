00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,740
[This drama has taken
a creative license to history.]

5
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,550
I am very thankful for your sincerity.

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,050
Your Majesty, do you
see my brother's heart?

7
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,150
How could I be apart
from a brother like this?

8
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:52,140
Please withdraw your orders
to send him to Shinju.

9
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,740
The tea water has run low.
I will go get more.

10
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,810
I will step out for a moment.

11
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,510
Was there something you
wanted to say, Yeon Hwa?

12
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,090
Ah, yes...

13
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,620
I have an important request
to make of you, Your Majesty.

14
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,200
It is a matter concerning
my brother Wook.

15
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,340
Your Highness!

16
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,960
Your Highness! Your Highness!

17
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,720
What's wrong?

18
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,340
What's wrong with you, Your Highness?

19
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,830
Help me.

20
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,620
Is anyone there? Please help me!

21
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,940
Your Highness!

22
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,550
Quiet... be quiet.

23
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,060
What?

24
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,080
You cannot be here. Go.

25
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,600
Your Highness, Your Highness!

26
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,340
Isn't anyone there? Please help me!

27
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:20,610
After seeing my 4th brother,
I would also like three drinks.

28
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,520
Then I would like to make
a request, Your Majesty.

29
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,490
[Episode 11]

30
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,170
What is this request?

31
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,060
I am starting to feel afraid.

32
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,210
I do not know what to expect either.

33
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,170
The two siblings are very close,
so I am certain it's for her brother.

34
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,350
Your Majesty.

35
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,190
A lot of time has passed since
the 8th Prince became a widower.

36
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,450
Please allow him to remarry and
prosper with many descendants.

37
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,470
Yeon Hwa.

38
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,510
What are your thoughts, Wook?

39
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:30,010
If you'll allow it,
there is someone in Goryeo.

40
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,310
Then there is no reason
for me to protest.

41
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,680
I will allow it.

42
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,400
Thank you for your great benevolence.

43
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,110
Your Majesty, my next request...

44
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,010
My next...

45
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,890
request...

46
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,150
Yeon Hwa.

47
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:03,000
Yeon Hwa! Yeon Hwa!

48
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,460
Sister!

49
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,940
Yeon Hwa!

50
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,660
It's poison.

51
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,450
I'm sure she drank poison.
Call the doctor now.

52
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,320
What about So? Hurry.

53
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,920
Yeon Hwa, Yeon Hwa!

54
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,210
Yeon Hwa!

55
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,530
Take the princess now!

56
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,660
Yeon Hwa... Yeon Hwa!

57
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,600
Why isn't anyone coming?
Is no one there!

58
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,430
So!

59
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,180
He's vomiting blood and won't wake up.
What's wrong with him?

60
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,420
It's poison.

61
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,490
Poison?

62
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,660
- Help me now.
- All right.

63
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,480
He has a pulse.

64
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,440
Take the 4th Prince to the doctor. Hurry!

65
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,500
Yes, Your Highness.

66
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,790
So, So!

67
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,140
She was the one who brought
the chrysanthemum tea.

68
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,140
Won...

69
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,040
Ji Mong, it was not her. There is no way!

70
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,070
Get her!

71
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,250
Damiwon's Hae Soo is under arrest
for attempting to assassinate a prince.

72
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,390
Where is Nan Hee?

73
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,270
Find out why Hae Soo
served the tea instead of her.

74
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,860
We searched the Damiwon and the palace,
but we can't find her.

75
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,940
Minister, we found the poison.

76
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,120
I'm sure you did.

77
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,360
I found this precious item, as well.

78
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,960
Of course, there is poison.

79
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,460
How is she, Doctor?
Why aren't you saying anything?

80
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,170
Do not worry.

81
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:36,870
Unlike the 4th Prince,
Princess Yeon Hwa only consumed a little.

82
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,130
She will wake up once the antidote
starts to take effect.

83
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,090
You need to rest.

84
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,340
Keep an eye on her in case
anything else goes wrong.

85
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,480
Yes, Your Highness.

86
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,670
Let's go, Mother.

87
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,970
Why are you so startled?

88
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:11,530
I'm only overjoyed because
you are awake, Your Highness.

89
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,500
Yet, your facial expression
is saying something else.

90
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,080
It's as if you saw me
pretend to drink poison

91
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,480
and then bite the inside
of my cheek to draw blood.

92
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,820
How could that be?

93
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,910
Of course.

94
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:29,570
Who would suspect that the princess of
this nation would purposely drink poison?

95
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,430
So think about this carefully, Doctor.

96
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,180
This is the palace where one wrong word
can determine if you live or die.

97
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,350
It was a poison that wouldn't be caught
by the court lady who tests it.

98
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,540
Even one drink can put you
on the brink of death.

99
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,010
It's a relief that the grand general
trained his body to take in poison.

100
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,590
Why do things like this
only happen to So?

101
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:33,660
I was always worried and
I truly thought he would die this time.

102
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,720
I'm sure they were after me.

103
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,870
I'm his older brother and I'm always
pushing him forward to die in my place.

104
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,330
I have no right to even
look him in the eye.

105
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,840
He must've known it was poisoned
when he took the first drink.

106
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,800
I cannot understand
why he had three drinks.

107
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,080
Unless he was determined to die...

108
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,740
If you think about it,
there were many things that were odd.

109
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,590
He suddenly wanted to toast to you,
Crown Prince, with three drinks.

110
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,580
He knew that he was poisoned,
but he left the feast.

111
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,560
I believe he knew who the culprit was.

112
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,870
Who was the culprit that he would
put his life on the line to protect them?

113
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,240
Your Highness, what about the 4th Prince?

114
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:24,550
Nothing bad happened to him, right?

115
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,760
It couldn't have.

116
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,020
He isn't someone who would
die so easily, right?

117
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,970
So... is fine.

118
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,740
He had a high resistance to poison
and they gave him the antidote quickly.

119
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,950
He is safe.

120
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,750
You need to think of yourself right now.

121
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,020
You are suspected of
putting the poison in the tea.

122
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,340
- No, I would never do that.
- I know that.

123
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,530
However, there is nothing
to prove your innocence.

124
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,950
They will demand to know
who ordered you to do this.

125
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,430
You may be tortured.

126
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,850
Even so...

127
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,040
Soo, you must survive it.

128
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,320
I will get you out of there.

129
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,820
You can't give up.

130
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:31,020
I won't let them use me
to try and frame someone else.

131
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm prepared for it, so don't worry.

132
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,000
Are you saying the Crown Prince
tried to poison the 4th Prince?

133
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,290
Poison and a precious necklace were
found in Court Lady Hae Soo's room.

134
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,550
Also, she was seen at the Damiwon
and at the Crown Prince's residence.

135
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,820
There is a witness who has seen them
conversing often one-on-one.

136
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,230
Is the evidence not clear?

137
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,670
It is possible that he was
trying to stop the 4th Prince

138
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,200
from becoming the Crown Prince.

139
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:10,240
Are you accusing me of being a shameless
person who would kill my brother?

140
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,250
After all your planning,
you came up with accusations and rumors?

141
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,180
Say it once more.

142
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:24,270
Say that I, Wang Moo, poisoned my own
brother just to keep my position!

143
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:27,070
What is your reason for giving that
necklace to Court Lady Hae?

144
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,810
You need to reveal your secrets first,
Your Highness!

145
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,180
This is disrespectful to His Majesty.
Do not do this.

146
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,350
Your illness will be exposed
if you get upset... please.

147
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,510
There were many eyes at this feast
and the possibility of an error was high.

148
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,910
How could one plan a poisoning?

149
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,740
Also, you say he gave the
poison to a court lady

150
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,240
he was friendly with at the Damiwon?

151
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,410
Isn't this just a plan to help
the culprit escape punishment?

152
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,030
It seems the poison was
intended for the Crown Prince

153
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,640
and it was mistakenly given
to the 4th Prince.

154
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,730
I am positive of it as
Princess Yeon Hwa was also poisoned.

155
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:16,970
Then are you saying that Court Lady Hae
tried to poison Crown Prince Moo?

156
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,880
That is not something we can conclude yet

157
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,200
so please do not make hasty judgments.

158
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,160
Hae Soo...

159
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,020
will be punished by hanging for
the attempted assassination of a prince.

160
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,370
She has done nothing wrong.

161
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,060
Would any man be able to
withstand the leg-screw torture?

162
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,860
Once they bring forth the false witnesses

163
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,640
you will be in trouble, Your Highness.

164
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,000
I believe they know
about your illness, as well.

165
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,420
Still, I cannot let another person
die because of me.

166
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,040
Instead, just throw me away.

167
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,270
That is nonsense!

168
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:05,130
If you appoint a new Crown Prince,
the nation and family will be at peace.

169
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,050
My good deeds are starting to dwindle.

170
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:17,450
What is your reason for
insisting that I must do it?

171
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:21,530
Moo... you are my first born.

172
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,910
The others are sons of a king.

173
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,900
Only you are the son of Wang Geon.

174
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,950
We fought in a war together.

175
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:34,370
We stood back to back
and saved each other's lives.

176
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,130
You are my son and my comrade.

177
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,380
To you...

178
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,120
I want to give you everything.

179
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,510
Do you not understand
your father's heart?

180
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:08,730
So, you'll hurt yourself
if you move around like this.

181
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:14,080
That girl... she's alone.

182
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,280
So!

183
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,490
Minister Park Young Gyu

184
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,270
claims that Crown Prince Moo
used Hae Soo to poison you.

185
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,260
That is nonsense.

186
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,360
Ignore him.

187
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,210
I know that it's nonsense.
Everyone knows!

188
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,730
But there is no way out of it.

189
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,940
I should not have let Hae Soo
get mixed up with you.

190
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,190
That is why this happened.

191
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,610
We have something to
talk about in private.

192
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,910
- What?
- Now!

193
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,650
It was Queen Yoo.

194
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,840
My mother.

195
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,650
She said so herself.

196
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,260
That she would be serving
Crown Prince Moo

197
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,580
poisoned chrysanthemum tea.

198
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,070
Did you drink the poison
for your mother's sake?

199
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,050
Just like you killed those
assassins for her before?

200
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:31,040
I did it to save Hae Soo
and to save Crown Prince Moo.

201
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,400
You?

202
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,720
For Hae Soo?

203
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,220
I was trying to keep anyone from
finding out about the poison.

204
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,620
It got complicated because
Yeon Hwa drank it.

205
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,500
I couldn't tell anyone
there was poison in it beforehand.

206
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,550
My mother's side had
prepared things too well.

207
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,640
So, Wook...

208
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,940
you need to expose what
Queen Yoo has done.

209
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,070
No one would stand up for Soo
as much as you.

210
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,020
It's the same for
Crown Prince Moo, as well.

211
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:11,760
I... will find evidence.

212
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,130
I won't leave Soo there like that.

213
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,580
I knew it.

214
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,540
I knew you wouldn't die.

215
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,700
Of course not.

216
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,680
It's going to take more than that.

217
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,040
You knew it was poisoned.

218
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,050
Did you drink it because
you knew I would

219
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,820
be under suspicion for serving the tea?

220
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,190
That's nonsense.

221
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,370
I'm not a pathetic man who
drinks poison because of a girl.

222
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,160
Why did you do it?

223
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,680
If you act so stubborn...

224
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,650
do you think my feelings will change?

225
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:58,750
What am I that you would
put your life on the line for me?

226
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:04,500
If you do this, it becomes harder for me
to turn away from you, Your Highness.

227
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,710
Just don't run away.

228
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,130
You really know how to cause me problems.

229
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,210
We both managed to survive and not die.

230
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,390
So I know we'll meet out here soon.

231
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,230
Gosh...

232
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,710
I don't know what to do with you.

233
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,740
You too.

234
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,890
Listen to the doctor and
receive your treatment well.

235
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,600
Don't be walking around like this.

236
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:49,640
You don't have to come
back here again, all right?

237
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,870
Always lecturing.

238
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,260
Thank you.

239
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,640
Please don't kill me.

240
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,090
If you give an honest testimony,
you will live.

241
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,770
Why don't you come out now?

242
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:03,720
Is a royal family member going
to let a court lady die like this?

243
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:12,520
I have my witness already,
so there is no point in hiding.

244
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,940
Must I call the royal guards?

245
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,040
Yes, it is me.

246
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,110
Why...

247
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:46,520
How is it that you are here?

248
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,290
Is the reason important?

249
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:53,200
You have to tell the king
that I did it in order to save Soo.

250
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:03,920
If your crime is exposed,
our family becomes traitors.

251
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,020
Yes.

252
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,630
I will be hanged
and Mother will be exiled.

253
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,570
Our home in Hwangju
will become a wasteland.

254
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:13,360
Why! Why did you do it?

255
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,290
I wanted to wake you up.

256
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:19,470
You should be this nation's king
but you threw it away for that girl!

257
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,820
- I do not want to be a king.
- No!

258
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,610
You do want it.

259
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,330
When you are alone...

260
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,900
what are your inner,
most secret thoughts?

261
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,680
What were you thinking as you watched
the 4th Prince at the rain ritual?

262
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,320
"That is my seat."

263
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,900
"Those cheers should be for me."

264
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:45,110
I saw it with my own eyes.

265
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,050
You want to be a king.

266
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,980
If you still say it's not true,
you can throw Mother and me away.

267
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,550
I will not resent you.

268
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,630
I was prepared for death when I did this.

269
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:24,770
You knew very well that I would not be
able to throw you and Mother away.

270
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,790
From this point and on...

271
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,990
Yeon Hwa...

272
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,840
you are not my sweet sister.

273
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,700
You are a debtor.

274
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,260
You to me and me to you.

275
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,780
We are indebted to each other.

276
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,540
That debt...

277
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,280
is a debt that I cannot pay
even if I walk my whole life.

278
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,180
I will repay it with the throne.

279
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,210
By all means...

280
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,300
do with me...

281
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,790
as you wish.

282
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:08,140
What is Soo supposed to do
if even you are not helping her?

283
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,600
Let's all visit the king together.

284
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,500
If we all beg with our lives on the line
I'm sure he will let her live.

285
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,000
Stop hiding and come on out.

286
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,820
Come on out.

287
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,320
You dare to spy on princes?

288
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,380
Is it true that Lady Soo is dying?

289
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,430
Why would she?

290
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:44,010
Why would Lady Soo die?

291
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:47,820
Look at her. You shouldn't get involved.

292
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:51,120
Get out. I said get out.

293
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:55,720
You won't let that happen, Your Highness.

294
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,850
Isn't that right?

295
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:59,180
Please, Your Highness.

296
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,270
Please save her.

297
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,890
Save her, please.

298
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,730
Your Highness, save her!

299
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:13,360
Your Highness, save her. Please!

300
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:18,540
Please save her. Please, Your Highness!

301
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,250
No matter what you do,
it cannot be stopped.

302
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,210
Her crimes are too large.

303
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,300
You have always been fair, Your Majesty.

304
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,550
Why was the investigation
so poorly executed this time?

305
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,600
Everyone can clearly see
she is not guilty.

306
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:55,440
You're not trying to use Hae Soo in
order to save the Crown Prince, are you?

307
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,650
I am trying to protect this country.

308
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,840
I am using one small life
to save a big life.

309
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:09,040
Now I see that being king means to cast
people aside and beg for his own life.

310
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:10,860
You impudent fool!

311
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,140
Do you want to die?

312
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,490
I thought you were a well-forged sword.

313
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,980
I was wrong about you.

314
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,040
The owner must be just
in order to wield the sword properly.

315
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,150
If you come to me again, you will die.

316
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:31,100
Anyone who comes to speak for Hae Soo
will receive the same treatment!

317
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,270
Your Majesty.

318
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,030
Your Majesty!

319
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:21,020
It does not seem like
you're here to drink tea.

320
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:31,760
Court Lady Oh, you are the only person
left of whom I can request this.

321
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,700
Stand up for Hae Soo.

322
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,620
I believe you can change the king's mind.

323
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:46,920
I cannot request something like this
using the fact that we were once close.

324
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,990
Then, are you going to
ignore it until it's over?

325
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,760
Will you leave Hae Soo to die?

326
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,180
I know.

327
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,930
You feel like a mother to her.

328
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,900
That's why you did not like
seeing her with me.

329
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:15,700
Why is it that you cannot
stand up for her yourself?

330
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,950
You said you loved her.

331
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,900
Even if you die,
you should try to save Hae Soo.

332
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,760
It would be better than
if I stood up for her.

333
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,740
Is it the queen and your household
that hold you back?

334
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,200
I suppose it may have something to do
with succession to the throne.

335
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:42,410
The reason men in the royal family
become cowards is always the same.

336
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,660
Court Lady Oh.

337
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:49,260
Someday, you will come to regret
how cowardly you were today.

338
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:55,600
The one time you turned your back on her
will haunt your conscience forever.

339
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,380
I will meet with the king because
I care for Hae Soo very much.

340
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:11,380
You could not save anyone, Your Highness.

341
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,670
Say something.

342
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:23,180
However, you cannot speak about Hae Soo.

343
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:27,760
I... poisoned the Crown Prince.

344
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,080
I lost my baby.

345
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:38,640
The princes grew up healthy and
I envied them for inheriting the throne.

346
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,630
So I tried to kill the Crown Prince.

347
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:44,430
I told you not to try and save that girl.

348
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,860
Why are you going after an innocent girl?

349
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,340
I will admit to my crimes,
so let Hae Soo--

350
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,840
I will pretend I didn't hear that.

351
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,180
Over 10 years ago...

352
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,390
a highly placed person
sent me some quince tea.

353
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,160
It was supposed to help
with morning sickness.

354
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,450
So I drank it every day.

355
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,880
I would wake up from my sleep
and drink it too.

356
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,280
Not even seven days had passed.

357
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,600
I lost your baby, Your Majesty.

358
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,860
Because of a cup of tea
that same person has set up

359
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,460
I cannot lose a girl that is
like my own daughter.

360
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,860
Hae Soo is not your child who died.

361
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,750
Also, there is no evidence
that it was Queen Yoo who did it.

362
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:13,760
Are you going to look
the other way this time too?

363
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,200
I will die soon.

364
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,510
Soo Yeon.

365
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:32,910
Since two days ago,
I haven't been able to digest food.

366
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,590
My vomiting returned.

367
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,880
I went to see the doctor.

368
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,090
He says it is stomach cancer.

369
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:50,280
I know you are killing Hae Soo
in order to protect the Crown Prince.

370
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,280
I know you cannot save both.

371
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:02,400
However, I cannot lose
my child to Queen Yoo.

372
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:04,910
Please help me.

373
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,980
It is my last request.

374
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,050
You...

375
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,650
are finally throwing me away?

376
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,100
Am I going to die?

377
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,740
What about the 8th Prince?

378
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,050
Where are you?

379
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:56,540
You have to see me.
You have to come see me.

380
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,090
Soo!

381
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,330
Move.

382
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,060
She's coming with me.

383
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,610
Must blood be shed for you to move?

384
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,740
It's a royal order! Royal order!

385
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,430
This hanging has been canceled.
The real culprit has been found.

386
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,000
Soo!

387
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,060
Court Lady Oh.

388
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,360
We have orders to arrest Damiwon's
Court Lady Oh for the crime of regicide.

389
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:41,230
I will follow those orders.

390
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,420
Court Lady Oh!

391
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,410
Soo!

392
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,090
What are they saying?

393
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:54,080
What do they mean regicide?

394
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,550
I put the poison in
the Crown Prince's tea.

395
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,870
Lies.

396
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,490
I am sorry I framed you for it.

397
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:21,840
Leave them.

398
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,590
Give them a moment.

399
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,290
There is no way out.

400
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:47,890
It's been blocked.

401
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,070
We can open it up again.

402
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,100
You said we should go to your hometown.

403
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:58,630
Let's go now.

404
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:05,680
If you say we should go...
I will go anywhere.

405
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:08,140
Come on.

406
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:11,530
I can't live like this anymore.

407
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:18,130
That's enough.

408
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,780
They're just covering it all up.

409
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,860
You're dying in my place!

410
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,090
Then... then what am I supposed to do?

411
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:29,060
How will I live?

412
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:34,550
No, I can't let you do this.

413
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,830
We're going to leave!

414
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:45,130
It's not your fault.

415
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,510
I am not doing it for you.

416
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,120
I'm doing it to help the king.

417
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,820
I can't live long anyway.

418
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,600
You don't need to feel sorry for me
or feel apologetic.

419
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,990
Please.

420
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,940
Please...

421
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:21,800
I'm fine.

422
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:33,700
I also protected
what I wanted to protect.

423
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,290
Now I need to pay for it.

424
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,040
I have no regrets.

425
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:47,610
Be careful of everything.

426
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:51,090
You can't trust anyone.

427
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:56,070
Every moment of every day,
and with every step you take

428
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:59,250
you need to be careful,
as if you are walking on thin ice.

429
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:07,180
You should not live like me.

430
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,490
All right?  

431
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:08,400
Your Majesty.

432
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,150
Please spare Court Lady Oh.

433
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,100
Court Lady Oh is innocent.

434
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:22,540
Your Majesty, please reconsider it.

435
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:26,260
Court Lady Oh is not the culprit.

436
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,900
Your Majesty.

437
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:32,110
Your Majesty, let Court Lady Oh live.

438
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,460
Go back.

439
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:36,970
You won't be of any help to her
if you go now.

440
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:41,010
I cannot leave her like that.

441
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:47,420
I have never stopped you from anything,
but this time you cannot go.

442
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:51,470
If you must go,
you will have to step on me.

443
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:53,930
- Mother.
- I need to protect my child!

444
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:57,090
You do not know what the king felt when
he decided to turn on Court Lady Oh.

445
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:01,860
If you get involved in this now,
it is like giving up your life.

446
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,370
You have already turned your back on her.

447
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,720
It isn't like you can't do it twice.

448
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:15,420
Yeon Hwa, how much more
do you want to be indebted to me?

449
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,650
What are you all doing here?

450
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:26,700
Ah, I heard that the Hae girl
was doing a kneeling protest.

451
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:31,230
You must be very upset, Wook.

452
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:33,170
I know you cared for her.

453
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:35,260
That's a misunderstanding.

454
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,790
She was only the cousin of his wife.

455
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:40,350
Hae Soo is not incorrect though.

456
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:44,770
You must believe that
Court Lady Oh is innocent.

457
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,860
Then, who is really guilty?

458
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,840
Is it the Crown Prince
or any of the other families?

459
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:54,830
Perhaps, you're suggesting it was me.

460
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:56,040
Queen Yoo.

461
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,810
- Queen!
- Mother!

462
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:03,330
Is it not enough to have thrown me out?

463
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:06,180
Please do not harm Wook or Yeon Hwa.

464
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,820
I cannot bear to see them
treated the way I was.

465
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:13,640
That is why I am on my knees like this.

466
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,720
Please... please!

467
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:23,890
You should have paid closer attention
to the upbringing of your son.

468
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:28,080
What good is it to be born with a
golden spoon in your mouth as a prince?

469
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,110
He should know who the owner
of that dinner table is.

470
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:38,490
That girl could end up dead,
at that rate.

471
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:42,130
She should have just died
if she was going to do that.

472
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:45,270
Why would she take another
person's life along with hers?

473
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,450
Stand up.

474
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:50,780
Think of how you look to the servants.

475
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:07,590
Your Majesty.

476
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,930
Please spare Court Lady Oh's life.

477
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:16,440
It is not fair, Your Majesty.

478
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:21,250
Your Majesty.

479
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:24,910
Your Majesty.

480
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:28,420
Court Lady Oh did not do it.

481
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,240
Your Majesty.

482
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:35,020
Your Majesty, let Court Lady Oh live.

483
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:56,780
You dummy.

484
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,230
Your Highness.

485
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:08,910
Do you think the king will change
his mind just because you do this?

486
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:13,360
You're already unwell.
Let's go before you get worse.

487
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:15,730
Court Lady Oh...

488
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:22,050
She took the blame to save my life.

489
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:23,770
Everyone knows that.

490
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:27,630
However, there is nothing
scarier than angering a king.

491
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:29,310
That is why no one can help you.

492
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:32,540
You need to give up now.

493
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:38,370
I cannot turn my back on
Court Lady Oh like this.

494
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:40,940
Why are you so stubborn?

495
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,680
Court Lady Oh barely managed to save you.

496
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:46,260
Are you going to throw that away?

497
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:49,930
Rather than doing nothing...

498
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,560
this is better.

499
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:00,090
There is nothing I can do
if you insist on being stubborn.

500
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:03,860
Endure it however you can.

501
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:07,940
I'll prepare medicine for you.

502
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:11,650
Your Highness.

503
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,370
Have you seen the 8th Prince,
by any chance?

504
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:23,530
Forget it.

505
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:40,140
Your Majesty, please cancel
the execution now if you can.

506
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:42,500
If you send Court Lady Oh away like this

507
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,450
you will only be left with regret.

508
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:49,160
Protecting the country and saving
the Crown Prince is important.

509
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,490
If you get rid of
all those you care about

510
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:53,960
how will you live with the loneliness?

511
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:57,000
That is the work of a King.

512
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,890
You must throw things away when you can.

513
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,670
Your Majesty.

514
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:05,700
Court Lady Hae Soo from the Damiwon

515
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:07,770
has been doing a
kneeling protest for two days.

516
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:11,470
Let her leave of her own accord.
Don't go out to her.

517
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:15,490
If anyone takes her side,
I will not let that go.

518
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:45,360
Why?

519
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:48,850
Stop.

520
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,510
I wanted to see you die in my lifetime.

521
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:03,120
I got my wish.

522
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:06,430
You have lost to me.

523
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,450
Dying first is losing.

524
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:16,060
You know very well, Your Majesty.

525
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:20,010
You have never beaten me, not once.

526
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:26,380
Will you still have that arrogance
when you are hanging by your throat?

527
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:32,250
Please live a long and
healthy life, Your Majesty.

528
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,590
How lonely that life will be...

529
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,800
I will be watching even in my afterlife.

530
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:43,110
You do that.

531
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,050
I am a queen.

532
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:51,750
You are a nameless court lady who
no one will remember once you die.

533
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:07,510
It's enough for me if
one person remembers me.

534
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:34,550
Court Lady... Court Lady Oh.

535
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:15,840
Your Majesty.

536
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:32,920
Court Lady Oh.

537
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,590
- Soo.
- Court Lady Oh.

538
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:37,500
- Soo, Soo!
- Court Lady Oh!

539
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:40,580
Let me go! Court Lady Oh, Court Lady Oh!

540
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:43,200
Court Lady Oh!

541
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:46,540
Court Lady Oh! Let go of me!

542
00:58:56,830 --> 00:59:00,000
If I had known someone
would die because of me...

543
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,760
I would not have been
so greedy to live again.

544
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:13,180
I wish this were all a dream.

545
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:20,170
I wish I could wake up
and not remember any of this.

546
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:35,230
