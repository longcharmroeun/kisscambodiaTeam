5
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:55,715
Why here?

6
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:59,768
The prince's living quarters
are luxurious and clean.

7
00:01:59,768 --> 00:02:02,322
Why do you insist on staying here?

8
00:02:05,703 --> 00:02:08,803
This is where I spend my time.
It belongs to me!

9
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:12,381
This is the king's palace.

10
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:14,687
You're saying something here
belongs to you?

11
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,322
Well, that's not what I meant.

12
00:02:17,322 --> 00:02:18,382
That's good, then.

13
00:02:19,432 --> 00:02:21,348
Breaking into someone's home is wrong.

14
00:02:21,348 --> 00:02:23,780
Can a prince do this?

15
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,461
I can't see the sky from my room.

16
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,928
I can't see the stars that rise
only in Goryeo either.

17
00:02:34,928 --> 00:02:36,741
Stars only in Goryeo?

18
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:39,229
Is there such a thing?

19
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,139
Mung beans, mulberry,
bletilla tuber, buttercups.

20
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:59,860
Trichosanthis root, spikenard,
galanga, sweet grass, incense.

21
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,916
Wow! Look at all of this.

22
00:03:02,835 --> 00:03:05,096
The 8th Prince sent for all of it.

23
00:03:05,096 --> 00:03:06,739
The prince?

24
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:09,418
You were looking for a hobby.

25
00:03:09,418 --> 00:03:11,872
He said you enjoy working with
these medicinal herbs.

26
00:03:15,168 --> 00:03:19,304
But... what is it that you plan
on making with all of this?

27
00:03:19,304 --> 00:03:22,442
A washing soap.
I will make you a soap to wash with.

28
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:53,727
Do you think the queen will like
these soaps like Lady Hae said?

29
00:03:53,727 --> 00:03:54,866
Of course.

30
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:57,788
There isn't a person in Goryeo
who wouldn't like it.

31
00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:30,905
Round, like this.

32
00:05:10,499 --> 00:05:12,377
It looks funny.

33
00:05:12,377 --> 00:05:13,995
Let's make it again.

34
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,762
I have never seen her so happy.

35
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:24,940
She is even more excited
to give it to the queen.

36
00:05:27,413 --> 00:05:28,903
She may not have said so...

37
00:05:28,903 --> 00:05:31,341
however, she must've been
frustrated to lose her memories.

38
00:05:31,925 --> 00:05:34,978
She still remembers how to do this.

39
00:05:36,514 --> 00:05:37,743
It is a relief.

40
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:43,889
Soo has become much more mature
since her injury.

41
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:46,827
She often says things that sound
wiser than anything I would say.

42
00:05:46,827 --> 00:05:49,867
At other times, she acts her age
and is very cute.

43
00:05:51,627 --> 00:05:55,627
Many times, I pondered
sending her back home.

44
00:05:56,454 --> 00:05:59,832
Now I'm very glad that I did not.

45
00:06:03,194 --> 00:06:07,605
I want to find a good mate for her here.

46
00:06:16,485 --> 00:06:18,947
I want her by our side for a long time.

47
00:06:20,257 --> 00:06:22,567
I want to see that laughing face of hers.

48
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:28,428
Yes.

49
00:06:29,617 --> 00:06:33,408
I feel the same way.

50
00:06:45,836 --> 00:06:47,091
A bit more of that...

51
00:07:12,072 --> 00:07:15,105
<i>I need to write a letter.
Can you get me a new ink pen?</i>

52
00:07:15,761 --> 00:07:18,093
<i>Come to the library
once you've finished eating.</i>

53
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:31,103
Myung Hee, I'm here.

54
00:07:46,144 --> 00:07:48,653
She had asked me for a new ink pen.

55
00:07:52,954 --> 00:07:55,810
Lady Hae was coughing badly,
so she went to bed.

56
00:07:57,582 --> 00:07:59,560
She asked me to write this on her behalf.

57
00:08:00,173 --> 00:08:02,060
Ah, I see.

58
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:21,300
The ink...

59
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,856
is over here.

60
00:08:23,856 --> 00:08:24,916
Oh, okay.

61
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,998
This is a poem written by Tao Yuanming
entitled "Come Away Home."

62
00:09:26,218 --> 00:09:28,657
- You've read it before, right?
- Yes... yes.

63
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:37,108
When Lady Hae sends a letter,
she always sends a poem, as well.

64
00:09:37,857 --> 00:09:39,050
Oh...

65
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:51,065
What about you?

66
00:09:51,695 --> 00:09:52,698
What?

67
00:09:54,478 --> 00:09:57,640
Do you like poems or songs?

68
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,151
Poems or songs...

69
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,252
I prefer songs, of course.

70
00:10:04,016 --> 00:10:06,200
Oh, really?

71
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,584
How unexpected.

72
00:10:08,914 --> 00:10:11,694
A noble lady like yourself is
drawn to the songs of commoners.

73
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:14,768
<i>What? It's not that kind of music?</i>

74
00:10:15,478 --> 00:10:17,794
<i>Ah, you fool.
He's referring to Goryeo music.</i>

75
00:10:17,794 --> 00:10:22,003
No, no. I, too, like poems
more than songs.

76
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:43,465
Then... I will give you this poem.

77
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,772
I feel that I want to give it to you.

78
00:11:02,013 --> 00:11:03,563
Read it carefully.

79
00:11:04,912 --> 00:11:06,123
Thank you.

80
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,766
- Chae Ryung.
- Yes, Lady.

81
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:39,982
Come here.

82
00:11:42,082 --> 00:11:45,151
I was given this thing here.

83
00:11:48,537 --> 00:11:49,627
Well...

84
00:11:50,268 --> 00:11:54,469
I forgot how to read
after I hurt my head.

85
00:11:54,469 --> 00:11:55,512
What?

86
00:11:55,935 --> 00:11:59,353
I'll learn it again,
but can you read this for me?

87
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:02,080
How would I know how to read?

88
00:12:02,785 --> 00:12:04,895
I only know my name.

89
00:12:06,707 --> 00:12:08,075
I'm sorry.

90
00:12:26,964 --> 00:12:29,656
Yang, Ryu, Chung, Chung, Kang, Su, Pyung!

91
00:12:30,747 --> 00:12:34,234
I can recognize
each character individually

92
00:12:34,234 --> 00:12:36,993
but it's like an alien language
when I read it altogether!

93
00:12:38,773 --> 00:12:42,892
Gosh, I'm illiterate here.
How can I live here?

94
00:12:52,026 --> 00:12:55,906
His handwriting is
just as handsome as he is.

95
00:12:57,675 --> 00:12:59,926
It would be even nicer
if I knew what it meant.

96
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:04,593
I wish I could read it.

97
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:10,508
I want to read it. I want to read it.
I want to read it. I want to read it!

98
00:13:10,508 --> 00:13:12,791
Why didn't you take a class
in Chinese characters?

99
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,060
What are you doing?

100
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,560
- Oh my.
- Are you illiterate?

101
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:21,906
No.

102
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,930
I know how to read, but...

103
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:29,660
I forgot everything when I hurt my head.

104
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:33,170
- Give it to me.
- Oh, no.

105
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,276
I said I'll read it for you.

106
00:13:35,276 --> 00:13:36,738
Let me see.

107
00:13:37,313 --> 00:13:39,085
"Green. O green is the willow"

108
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,599
"Placid, peaceful the flow,"

109
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:43,236
"Hark and I hear on the river...."

110
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:48,718
Hey, you.

111
00:13:48,718 --> 00:13:52,637
"To the east, the sun is up.
To the west, drizzles persist."

112
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:55,714
"Though they say the sun is naught"

113
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,578
"to me, the sun is aglow."

114
00:14:00,497 --> 00:14:02,027
It is a lovely poem.

115
00:14:03,088 --> 00:14:05,909
It is a poem written by Liu Yuxi
entitled "Song of Bamboo Twigs".

116
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:09,805
Do you know what the poem means?

117
00:14:12,248 --> 00:14:14,982
"Green, O green is the willow."

118
00:14:14,982 --> 00:14:19,722
So, it must be about
the beautiful landscape, right?

119
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:23,862
This wouldn't have been written
by an illiterate person.

120
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,651
Who gave it to you?

121
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:29,391
The 8th Prince gave it to me to study.

122
00:14:37,092 --> 00:14:39,257
Is it true that you really can't read?

123
00:14:39,257 --> 00:14:40,810
You're not just pretending?

124
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:44,902
No. Why would I pretend to be stupid?

125
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,359
The prince gave you a good poem,
so make sure to return the favor.

126
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:55,989
Also, you will be greeting the queen
tomorrow in the palace, so be prepared.

127
00:14:55,989 --> 00:14:58,690
The palace? I'm going to the palace?

128
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,979
Yes, you'll be giving her
the soaps that you made.

129
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:06,247
Okay! Then I'll get ready.

130
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,136
Is my brother in his right mind?

131
00:15:15,662 --> 00:15:18,608
It is merely a common poem
about the landscape.

132
00:15:18,608 --> 00:15:20,593
That poem is about love.

133
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:23,762
In the last section,
a word is changed to "love"

134
00:15:23,762 --> 00:15:25,302
and is used to make a confession.

135
00:15:25,302 --> 00:15:27,310
Are you really telling me
that you did not know?

136
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,290
When you got married, I...

137
00:15:41,854 --> 00:15:43,055
Is it possible?

138
00:15:47,142 --> 00:15:48,950
Did you know everything beforehand?

139
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:55,958
You already knew how Wook felt.

140
00:15:57,446 --> 00:15:58,737
I'm right, aren't I?

141
00:15:59,537 --> 00:16:00,575
Baek Ah.

142
00:16:06,436 --> 00:16:11,165
You need to finish your drawing for me
by the end of today.

143
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,031
Myung Hee.

144
00:16:21,885 --> 00:16:25,516
So, the willow is green,
and the water placid and peaceful.

145
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,617
The young man sings a song of love.

146
00:16:32,056 --> 00:16:35,664
He didn't think the sun was naught...

147
00:16:36,757 --> 00:16:38,179
But it was?

148
00:16:43,876 --> 00:16:44,968
Gosh.

149
00:16:46,415 --> 00:16:47,786
No, no, no.

150
00:16:50,373 --> 00:16:52,641
What other meaning could there be?

151
00:17:03,411 --> 00:17:04,651
No, there isn't!

152
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,654
Stop thinking that way.

153
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:12,369
The prince is just...
yes, a landlord.

154
00:17:13,021 --> 00:17:15,040
Just consider him a landlord.

155
00:17:19,551 --> 00:17:22,292
You need to control your own heart.

156
00:17:23,651 --> 00:17:26,037
My heart is my own.

157
00:17:31,797 --> 00:17:34,074
Landlord... landlord.

158
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:20,837
You never come by Damiwon Palace.

159
00:18:20,837 --> 00:18:22,803
What brings you by today?

160
00:18:23,454 --> 00:18:27,176
Wook wanted to drop by with
his wife and his wife's cousin.

161
00:18:27,176 --> 00:18:29,357
My daughter-in-law isn't feeling well.

162
00:18:29,357 --> 00:18:31,964
I wanted to get her some medicine
from Royal Concubine Oh.

163
00:18:32,754 --> 00:18:35,634
I don't know why people put
so much trust in Royal Concubine Oh.

164
00:18:35,634 --> 00:18:38,214
She's not a doctor.
She's just a court lady.

165
00:18:39,405 --> 00:18:42,945
By the way,
Prince Jung has grown quite a bit.

166
00:18:42,945 --> 00:18:45,794
I heard that you have a private teacher
for him in your home.

167
00:18:46,712 --> 00:18:48,796
The teacher is already 70 years old.

168
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:50,589
He should have a teacher
who can teach him

169
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:52,212
about more than just his own experience.

170
00:18:52,983 --> 00:18:57,264
Who is Wook learning from?

171
00:18:57,264 --> 00:19:00,429
Wook likes to read and read again.

172
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:04,087
If he has anything he does not know,
he discusses it with a teacher.

173
00:19:04,587 --> 00:19:08,287
He refused a teacher early on.

174
00:19:08,287 --> 00:19:10,631
You're keeping his teacher a secret?

175
00:19:11,499 --> 00:19:14,158
Are you concerned about
his much younger brother?

176
00:19:16,678 --> 00:19:18,628
The 8th Prince is here.

177
00:19:35,095 --> 00:19:36,941
Hello to both of you, Your Highnesses.

178
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:41,671
Come on in.

179
00:19:41,671 --> 00:19:43,498
You must be Hae Soo.

180
00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:46,342
This is my first time
seeing you this close up.

181
00:19:46,342 --> 00:19:48,543
You sure are very pretty.

182
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:51,573
It is nice to meet you, Queen Hwangbo.

183
00:19:52,435 --> 00:19:55,457
This is my daughter-in-law's
sixth cousin, Soo.

184
00:19:55,457 --> 00:19:56,775
Yes.

185
00:19:59,829 --> 00:20:04,058
Oh... you must be the girl
Jung told me about.

186
00:20:04,058 --> 00:20:06,668
The girl who hit the
10th Prince severely?

187
00:20:09,171 --> 00:20:11,011
I have heard about your actions.

188
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:14,503
I have heard you get along
well with my sons.

189
00:20:17,105 --> 00:20:19,800
It is nice to meet you, Queen Yoo.

190
00:20:21,731 --> 00:20:24,991
Soo has made a gift
for you, Your Highness.

191
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:43,831
Oh my word! How beautiful.

192
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:45,723
I have never seen anything like it.

193
00:20:47,249 --> 00:20:49,053
If you use it every time you bathe

194
00:20:49,053 --> 00:20:52,644
your skin will become...
quite... soft.

195
00:21:03,207 --> 00:21:05,588
Thank you. I will use it well.

196
00:21:09,117 --> 00:21:11,621
We have one for you as well, Queen Yoo.

197
00:21:12,947 --> 00:21:14,006
Me too?

198
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:21,925
I know you like fragrant things.

199
00:21:21,925 --> 00:21:23,256
Please accept it.

200
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:32,785
You have a very good daughter-in-law,
Queen Hwangbo.

201
00:21:33,285 --> 00:21:35,066
Too bad you do not have children.

202
00:21:35,066 --> 00:21:37,175
There would be no flaws, otherwise.

203
00:21:41,936 --> 00:21:44,717
They say big blessings
do not come so easily.

204
00:21:45,515 --> 00:21:47,207
Thank you for your concern.

205
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,636
<i>The king will enter.</i>

206
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,637
<i>It's Taejo Wang Geon.</i>

207
00:21:57,637 --> 00:21:59,511
<i>Taejo Wang Geon who founded Goryeo!</i>

208
00:21:59,511 --> 00:22:02,790
<i>I've only seem him in TV dramas.
Now I'm seeing him for real.</i>

209
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,580
<i>Awesome.</i>

210
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:08,143
Have you arrived, Your Majesty?

211
00:22:08,608 --> 00:22:10,501
This looks like a pleasant chat.

212
00:22:13,714 --> 00:22:16,325
I have heard that
you were not feeling well.

213
00:22:16,325 --> 00:22:19,386
Now that I know you are worried for me,
I feel like I am fully recovered.

214
00:22:25,983 --> 00:22:29,973
Is this the girl who got into a fight
with Eun, by any chance?

215
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:36,245
They were only playing around.

216
00:22:36,245 --> 00:22:38,808
A prince ended up
with wounds on his face.

217
00:22:38,808 --> 00:22:40,822
The playing went too far.

218
00:22:42,313 --> 00:22:46,451
How could this cute and pretty girl
have gotten into such a fight with Eun?

219
00:22:46,451 --> 00:22:48,185
I have committed a deadly crime!

220
00:22:54,821 --> 00:22:56,425
Are you afraid of the king?

221
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:01,110
<i>Get your act together.</i>

222
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,781
<i>A tyrant lives off of fear</i>

223
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,778
<i>while a good and wise king
lives off of virtue.</i>

224
00:23:08,644 --> 00:23:13,168
You are a good and wise king,
so I am not afraid.

225
00:23:16,075 --> 00:23:17,705
A good and wise king?

226
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:21,240
Why do you think that I am
a good and wise king?

227
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:37,609
Were you planning on getting away
with it by using some flattery?

228
00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:41,869
<i>Please, please, please, please!</i>

229
00:23:41,869 --> 00:23:43,980
<i>Think of something. You have to think.</i>

230
00:23:48,056 --> 00:23:49,083
Well...

231
00:23:50,165 --> 00:23:53,102
You united the three lands
and founded a new nation.

232
00:23:56,062 --> 00:23:58,616
You didn't discriminate against people
from the fallen lands.

233
00:23:58,616 --> 00:24:00,359
You appointed them to high positions.

234
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:04,533
Also, also... what else?

235
00:24:06,492 --> 00:24:07,896
Balhae, Balhae.

236
00:24:07,896 --> 00:24:10,332
Balhae disappeared but you stayed loyal.

237
00:24:10,332 --> 00:24:12,279
That is why you are a good and wise king.

238
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,877
She is very clever.

239
00:24:34,777 --> 00:24:36,835
<i>My junior high history teacher...</i>

240
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:39,417
<i>I'm sorry for cursing you
when you made us memorize this.</i>

241
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:41,568
<i>Thank you! You'll be blessed.</i>

242
00:24:41,568 --> 00:24:44,646
I see fighting is not all
that you're good at.

243
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:50,396
You may reward her with a Persian rug.

244
00:24:50,396 --> 00:24:52,211
Yes, Your Majesty.

245
00:24:52,211 --> 00:24:54,226
A precious rug like that.

246
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,409
What an honor for her!

247
00:25:03,873 --> 00:25:06,798
Soo... you should thank him.

248
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:13,338
You are very benevolent, Your Majesty!

249
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:28,365
Gosh, where's the bathroom?

250
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:33,499
I was so nervous in there.
My stomach is killing me.

251
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:35,580
Where is the bathroom? Where?

252
00:25:37,944 --> 00:25:40,179
Where is it? Where is it?

253
00:26:02,774 --> 00:26:04,035
Oh wow.

254
00:26:05,306 --> 00:26:06,974
Wow!

255
00:26:11,168 --> 00:26:14,348
What are you doing here?
This is no place for you.

256
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,428
You've become a
completely different person.

257
00:26:19,031 --> 00:26:20,991
Now anyone would know
that you're a prince.

258
00:26:20,991 --> 00:26:23,701
I was born to be. I was already a prince.

259
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,140
What about you?

260
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,220
Are you here to spy on people
bathing again?

261
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:32,268
I had a gift for the queen

262
00:26:32,268 --> 00:26:35,671
and the 8th Prince let me
come along to see the palace.

263
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:41,201
Are you doing well in this place?

264
00:26:41,201 --> 00:26:42,755
Of course.

265
00:26:42,755 --> 00:26:46,482
Like you said, it's my home
with my mother and siblings.

266
00:26:46,482 --> 00:26:48,097
Ah, I see.

267
00:26:48,097 --> 00:26:50,830
It's too big for a home.

268
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,405
Do you even get to see
your parents every day?

269
00:27:13,403 --> 00:27:16,644
You got to stay here like you wanted.
Do you think you'll get what you want?

270
00:27:18,654 --> 00:27:21,883
I sent you to get adopted as a
gesture of goodwill to that family.

271
00:27:21,883 --> 00:27:23,091
You couldn't even stay.

272
00:27:24,082 --> 00:27:25,403
You're useless.

273
00:27:25,403 --> 00:27:28,081
You were born in the same year,
but you are nowhere near Wook.

274
00:27:31,092 --> 00:27:33,312
Your only talent is in killing people.

275
00:27:33,312 --> 00:27:37,165
You don't know anything,
so how will you last in the palace?

276
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:41,861
Thank you for your concern.

277
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:45,481
I will not be a burden to you.

278
00:27:45,481 --> 00:27:49,181
I will use every ounce of my strength
to make sure that I'm not.

279
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,570
Is she really his mother?

280
00:28:23,504 --> 00:28:26,107
That was a terrible thing to witness.

281
00:28:29,123 --> 00:28:31,325
Should I have told him I was leaving?

282
00:28:38,262 --> 00:28:41,953
What could be so important that you
wouldn't take care of your health first?

283
00:28:47,568 --> 00:28:49,067
Is anyone out there?

284
00:28:49,067 --> 00:28:51,181
Call the doctor now.

285
00:28:52,926 --> 00:28:55,215
I have something I need to say to you.

286
00:28:55,646 --> 00:28:57,204
My child.

287
00:28:57,204 --> 00:28:59,340
You told me on my wedding day.

288
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,967
You said I was a great source
of strength to the prince.

289
00:29:01,967 --> 00:29:05,514
You said you would grant
a request of mine later on.

290
00:29:07,657 --> 00:29:13,127
No matter how difficult it was,
you promised you would.

291
00:29:16,983 --> 00:29:20,241
My child, what can I do for you?

292
00:29:26,542 --> 00:29:27,660
Hae Soo...

293
00:29:30,388 --> 00:29:32,439
please accept her as the prince's wife.

294
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,477
You know.

295
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:45,714
I no longer have many days left.

296
00:30:05,521 --> 00:30:07,529
Are you here, Your Highness?

297
00:30:09,117 --> 00:30:11,579
Ji Mong, I came to visit my mother.

298
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:14,444
Mister! You know me, don't you?

299
00:30:14,444 --> 00:30:15,752
What?

300
00:30:15,752 --> 00:30:17,300
You've met me before.

301
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,665
We... even had a drink together.

302
00:30:20,513 --> 00:30:23,365
What is this outrageous story?

303
00:30:25,965 --> 00:30:30,136
Soo, you've met the astronomer
Choi Ji Mong before?

304
00:30:30,136 --> 00:30:32,160
Of course!

305
00:30:36,325 --> 00:30:38,790
Mister, you really don't know me?

306
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:42,817
I was looking all over for you.

307
00:30:43,246 --> 00:30:46,378
But I do not know you, my lady.

308
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:49,627
I just found out that you were
the cousin of the 8th Prince's wife.

309
00:30:49,627 --> 00:30:51,767
I didn't look like this back then.

310
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:52,788
It wasn't in Goryeo.

311
00:30:52,788 --> 00:30:55,683
So, it's in about a thousand years!

312
00:30:55,683 --> 00:30:58,126
A thousand years from now
by a lake in a park.

313
00:30:58,126 --> 00:30:59,506
Be careful.

314
00:30:59,506 --> 00:31:00,711
Excuse me?

315
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,373
Inside the palace...

316
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:09,675
you must always watch what you say.

317
00:31:09,675 --> 00:31:12,807
It is a place where speaking freely
can be dangerous.

318
00:31:12,807 --> 00:31:15,854
Especially regarding the throne
or the royal family.

319
00:31:15,854 --> 00:31:19,667
If you ended up living here,
you should abide by the norms here.

320
00:31:19,667 --> 00:31:24,396
Your life can't change
just because you want it to.

321
00:31:24,396 --> 00:31:27,756
Your life can't change
just because you want it to.

322
00:32:53,877 --> 00:32:58,195
So, do you and Choi Ji Mong
already know each other?

323
00:33:00,586 --> 00:33:03,676
I thought I knew him,
but I was wrong.

324
00:33:05,137 --> 00:33:06,287
I see.

325
00:33:07,636 --> 00:33:08,705
Wait.

326
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:30,678
I made this for you when
I made soap for the queens.

327
00:33:32,998 --> 00:33:35,087
I have a lot to thank you for.

328
00:33:35,687 --> 00:33:38,521
You even taught me about poems.

329
00:33:48,898 --> 00:33:49,966
Thank you.

330
00:33:56,668 --> 00:34:00,608
Yes, so do you know
the meaning of that poem?

331
00:34:01,936 --> 00:34:03,287
Of course.

332
00:34:05,225 --> 00:34:07,765
There's a green willow tree by the water.

333
00:34:07,765 --> 00:34:10,502
A man is happy and he sings.

334
00:34:11,117 --> 00:34:13,945
It was a beautiful poem.

335
00:34:17,725 --> 00:34:21,604
Yes, then you should
give me a poem to respond.

336
00:34:22,721 --> 00:34:23,764
What?

337
00:34:24,189 --> 00:34:26,888
It is the proper etiquette to reply
to a poem with another poem.

338
00:34:28,605 --> 00:34:31,506
Will you write me something you like?

339
00:34:33,626 --> 00:34:34,742
Oh...

340
00:34:36,088 --> 00:34:37,136
Yes.

341
00:35:00,242 --> 00:35:02,669
I got it wrong again!

342
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:12,437
The white part is the paper.
The black is the letter.

343
00:35:13,577 --> 00:35:17,414
I have to know something
in order to copy it.

344
00:35:18,765 --> 00:35:24,606
I am going to go crazy and lose my mind.

345
00:35:27,903 --> 00:35:30,155
How am I supposed to write a reply?

346
00:35:30,803 --> 00:35:33,584
Oh, what do I do now?

347
00:35:34,314 --> 00:35:36,434
I shouldn't have pretended I could.

348
00:35:38,044 --> 00:35:39,524
I don't know anymore!

349
00:36:41,055 --> 00:36:44,008
Stop it! I'm serious!

350
00:36:49,077 --> 00:36:50,269
Soo!

351
00:36:51,707 --> 00:36:54,526
What brings you here?
Are you here to see me?

352
00:36:54,526 --> 00:36:58,037
No, that's not it.
I had to drop off something.

353
00:36:58,037 --> 00:36:59,345
Is it food?

354
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:04,944
Is it this?

355
00:37:05,655 --> 00:37:07,852
Yes, it's this.

356
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:19,321
I... taught her a poem and told her
to reply with another poem.

357
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:20,809
- You can go now.
- Yes.

358
00:37:34,513 --> 00:37:35,588
Wook.

359
00:37:37,343 --> 00:37:40,361
Let's take a look at what Soo wrote.
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

360
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:41,912
Wait...

361
00:37:53,569 --> 00:37:57,098
What is this thing?
Did she write something or draw?

362
00:37:57,738 --> 00:38:00,388
You idiots. Give it to me.

363
00:38:08,048 --> 00:38:10,508
Wook, you know what this is?

364
00:38:20,348 --> 00:38:22,138
Well, this is...

365
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,423
No, how does this thing...

366
00:38:27,423 --> 00:38:32,155
Are these written characters
or is it a drawing?

367
00:38:32,979 --> 00:38:34,678
Can you tell?

368
00:38:37,997 --> 00:38:39,209
What about you, So?

369
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,834
Raise your arms.

370
00:38:51,341 --> 00:38:52,678
To the sky.

371
00:38:55,428 --> 00:38:56,597
Open your mouth.

372
00:38:58,097 --> 00:38:59,207
Make it rounder.

373
00:39:04,488 --> 00:39:06,437
There. That's it right there.

374
00:39:06,437 --> 00:39:09,118
So, that's ridiculous!

375
00:39:10,626 --> 00:39:12,537
He's right. It is.

376
00:39:12,537 --> 00:39:14,738
- It's completely right.
- Let me see.

377
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:21,026
You should all come look at this!

378
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:23,809
It's a face laughing with excitement.

379
00:39:23,809 --> 00:39:25,595
Oh, a laughing face!

380
00:39:25,595 --> 00:39:27,959
She must have liked Wook's poem a lot.

381
00:39:31,231 --> 00:39:32,466
Let me try too.

382
00:39:34,111 --> 00:39:35,988
You try too. You try.

383
00:39:39,037 --> 00:39:40,401
Stop right there!

384
00:39:43,669 --> 00:39:45,171
Stop!

385
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,472
What are you doing?

386
00:39:53,917 --> 00:39:54,921
What?

387
00:39:56,071 --> 00:39:57,867
How could you do that to Myung Hee?

388
00:39:59,013 --> 00:40:00,838
You know what kind of person she is.

389
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:06,613
You know her feelings for Wook.
Who are you to behave this way?

390
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:09,147
What did I do that you're doing this?

391
00:40:11,928 --> 00:40:13,410
What did you do?

392
00:40:15,222 --> 00:40:16,872
You steal glances at each other.

393
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:18,921
When you happen to brush hands

394
00:40:18,921 --> 00:40:20,993
you will ponder on it
repeatedly for days.

395
00:40:23,263 --> 00:40:25,651
"What kind of food does he like?"

396
00:40:26,803 --> 00:40:28,611
"What will make him smile?"

397
00:40:29,131 --> 00:40:31,234
This probably never leaves your mind.

398
00:40:33,908 --> 00:40:36,280
Everything you look at
makes you think of him.

399
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:39,694
Those feelings of longing
between you two!

400
00:40:41,385 --> 00:40:43,046
Did you think no one would know?

401
00:40:45,995 --> 00:40:49,693
I know... and Myung Hee knows.

402
00:40:51,207 --> 00:40:54,584
Myung Hee knows everything.

403
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:56,914
Myung Hee does?

404
00:40:57,725 --> 00:40:58,854
Listen carefully.

405
00:41:00,796 --> 00:41:02,997
All she has is Wook.

406
00:41:02,997 --> 00:41:05,747
She has only ever had eyes for Wook.

407
00:41:05,747 --> 00:41:09,990
But if you... if you hurt her...

408
00:41:13,459 --> 00:41:15,633
I won't stand by and let that happen.

409
00:41:55,966 --> 00:41:58,202
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

410
00:41:58,202 --> 00:41:59,843
It's my fault.

411
00:42:01,914 --> 00:42:03,852
I said I wouldn't be a burden.

412
00:42:05,361 --> 00:42:07,582
But I became your heaviest burden.

413
00:42:08,698 --> 00:42:10,441
It isn't your fault, Soo.

414
00:42:13,711 --> 00:42:15,365
I gave you the poem.

415
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:18,111
And I received yours.

416
00:42:19,713 --> 00:42:22,644
I made an effort to make you laugh.
It was all me.

417
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,888
It's all my fault.

418
00:42:30,367 --> 00:42:33,450
Don't blame yourself.
Please don't do that.

419
00:42:35,859 --> 00:42:38,461
I knew that a person's feelings
could be dangerous.

420
00:42:40,189 --> 00:42:44,307
I pretended not to notice
and assumed it would resolve itself.

421
00:42:47,111 --> 00:42:49,079
I took your hand.

422
00:42:51,037 --> 00:42:53,166
And I came out of my room that night.

423
00:42:53,166 --> 00:42:54,809
That was my fault.

424
00:43:01,809 --> 00:43:03,068
Please...

425
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:06,522
don't say things like that.

426
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:14,928
When I'm with you...

427
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:17,839
I am always crying.

428
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,310
I'm sorry for that.

429
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:50,841
I thought it was time for a new pillow,
so I made that for you.

430
00:44:51,144 --> 00:44:54,127
I must be the King of Heaven
to sleep on such finery.

431
00:44:54,127 --> 00:44:56,515
My skills are still lacking.

432
00:44:58,106 --> 00:45:00,968
They say fathers with daughters
can easily become fools.

433
00:45:00,968 --> 00:45:02,477
I am like that.

434
00:45:04,265 --> 00:45:07,955
You are such a beautiful young lady.
Who can I marry you off to?

435
00:45:08,555 --> 00:45:11,294
I'm sure you will choose well
for me, Your Majesty.

436
00:45:12,796 --> 00:45:16,684
I want you to live happily
like my elder daughter.

437
00:45:16,684 --> 00:45:18,865
Though it is unfortunate
that I don't see her often.

438
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:22,309
Is it not true that Princess Naklang
married and is happy where she is now?

439
00:45:25,546 --> 00:45:30,475
Does that mean you wish for me to
live far away from the palace?

440
00:45:32,455 --> 00:45:34,734
Why? Do you not want to?

441
00:45:36,644 --> 00:45:40,725
If it is a place you choose for me,
I will be happy wherever I go.

442
00:45:40,725 --> 00:45:44,231
I will wait for you to find
a good match for me, Your Majesty.

443
00:45:45,399 --> 00:45:48,660
Yeon Hwa, how is it that you only
say things that bring me joy?

444
00:45:49,754 --> 00:45:53,999
You are my greatest joy in my old age.

445
00:45:53,999 --> 00:45:55,852
Thank you.

446
00:46:14,693 --> 00:46:16,013
So!

447
00:46:18,934 --> 00:46:19,970
Yes.

448
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:26,642
I'm still not used to
seeing you in the palace.

449
00:46:28,339 --> 00:46:30,897
I don't feel like these
are my clothes yet.

450
00:46:31,925 --> 00:46:33,691
You must be here to see the king.

451
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:34,778
Yes.

452
00:46:35,899 --> 00:46:39,838
The king must be planning
to marry me off.

453
00:46:40,646 --> 00:46:44,046
Oh, really? Has he chosen someone?

454
00:46:45,546 --> 00:46:46,794
The thing is...

455
00:46:46,794 --> 00:46:49,553
Why? You don't think it's you, do you?

456
00:46:55,588 --> 00:46:57,642
Don't bother having useless expectations.

457
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:02,140
It may have been a surprise that the
king allowed you to stay in the palace.

458
00:47:02,888 --> 00:47:05,905
But he will never let you have someone
so precious like Yeon Hwa.

459
00:47:06,983 --> 00:47:10,854
Do you want to see and make a bet on it?

460
00:47:11,363 --> 00:47:13,852
Are there fools who make bets
on such obvious things?

461
00:47:13,852 --> 00:47:15,644
Then, let's ask Yeon Hwa.

462
00:47:15,644 --> 00:47:21,541
Does she have the confidence to live
looking upon that ugly face forever?

463
00:47:26,151 --> 00:47:28,309
I'm not looking for a great man.

464
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:30,749
I'm waiting for a man
who will cherish me.

465
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:34,336
Someone who will treasure me.

466
00:47:34,336 --> 00:47:37,910
He must know your value
in order to treasure you.

467
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:42,222
Yeon Hwa, I would treat you
like this nation's queen.

468
00:47:42,222 --> 00:47:45,118
You have always been kind to me.

469
00:47:46,921 --> 00:47:49,059
What about you, So?

470
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:55,059
You're not asking me to put
a value on you, are you?

471
00:47:55,801 --> 00:47:59,539
Rather than a woman of high value,
I want one who will treasure me.

472
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:05,180
Someone who would not be concerned
about this ugly face of mine.

473
00:48:14,776 --> 00:48:16,060
He's just saying that.

474
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:19,137
He always shows off like that.

475
00:48:19,137 --> 00:48:21,582
Yet, he is only a struggling animal.

476
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:27,118
How much fun would it be to
turn an animal into a human?

477
00:48:28,481 --> 00:48:30,562
Sometimes I am curious about that.

478
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:39,131
Myung Hee!

479
00:49:41,124 --> 00:49:43,923
Myung Hee, are you okay?

480
00:49:51,952 --> 00:49:55,022
Chae Ryung. Chae Ryung, Chae Ryung!

481
00:49:55,022 --> 00:49:57,615
Is anyone there? Chae Ryung!

482
00:49:57,615 --> 00:49:58,798
Soo!

483
00:49:59,689 --> 00:50:00,787
You...

484
00:50:01,816 --> 00:50:05,287
What are your feelings for the prince?

485
00:50:17,254 --> 00:50:18,823
You're so foolish.

486
00:50:21,095 --> 00:50:25,138
You are both so foolish.

487
00:50:31,347 --> 00:50:32,579
Can you...

488
00:50:35,608 --> 00:50:37,428
do my makeup for me?

489
00:50:39,227 --> 00:50:40,269
What?

490
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:43,823
It's for him.

491
00:50:46,481 --> 00:50:50,544
I want him to remember me
looking beautiful.

492
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:55,821
Myung Hee.

493
00:51:43,821 --> 00:51:45,026
<i>Soo.</i>

494
00:51:46,542 --> 00:51:49,575
<i>You have a feverish body
and catch colds very easily.</i>

495
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:53,454
<i>You must always remember
to have ginger in honey.</i>

496
00:51:56,243 --> 00:51:58,383
<i>You live in close quarters
to the royal family.</i>

497
00:51:59,704 --> 00:52:02,856
<i>Be careful with your
words and actions, always.</i>

498
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:09,151
<i>I am always worried about your
uncontrollable temper.</i>

499
00:52:12,403 --> 00:52:14,251
<i>And about the prince...</i>

500
00:52:18,281 --> 00:52:22,492
<i>I want you to make a pillow for him.</i>

501
00:52:24,553 --> 00:52:26,696
<i>He has many worries.</i>

502
00:52:27,267 --> 00:52:30,841
<i>I would like it if he could
be comfortable in his sleep.</i>

503
00:52:35,742 --> 00:52:37,001
<i>I'm asking you...</i>

504
00:52:39,334 --> 00:52:41,001
<i>to take care of him.</i>

505
00:53:25,097 --> 00:53:27,419
Your Highness! Your Highness!

506
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:33,182
- Soo.
- It's Myung Hee.

507
00:53:33,772 --> 00:53:37,651
She's looking for you. Hurry up.

508
00:53:54,448 --> 00:53:58,457
Lady Hae, I think we should head back in.

509
00:54:00,888 --> 00:54:02,640
I wanted to come out with you.

510
00:54:03,877 --> 00:54:08,537
I wanted to come out to see the snow.

511
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:12,888
Do you remember?

512
00:54:15,803 --> 00:54:19,118
<i>Do you remember when I first saw you?</i>

513
00:54:42,475 --> 00:54:45,414
<i>I knew you found me to be a burden.</i>

514
00:54:46,004 --> 00:54:48,475
<i>I still stubbornly pushed for marriage.</i>

515
00:54:49,946 --> 00:54:52,064
<i>You had been kicked out of the palace.</i>

516
00:54:52,792 --> 00:54:55,524
<i>You were a prince
whose wings had been cut off.</i>

517
00:54:56,446 --> 00:55:00,535
<i>I wanted to help you rise up
with my own hands.</i>

518
00:55:07,943 --> 00:55:08,943
Lady Hae.

519
00:55:13,564 --> 00:55:16,524
Why would you think that
I didn't know how you felt, Lady Hae?

520
00:55:55,296 --> 00:55:56,791
Now...

521
00:55:58,122 --> 00:56:00,769
I want you, Your Highness...

522
00:56:02,184 --> 00:56:04,421
to watch over Soo.

523
00:56:07,461 --> 00:56:12,289
Think about my feelings for you.

524
00:56:13,671 --> 00:56:14,921
Please, Soo...

525
00:56:16,713 --> 00:56:18,013
That child...

526
00:56:22,323 --> 00:56:25,305
Lady Hae? Lady, Lady.

527
00:56:47,294 --> 00:56:48,653
Lady Hae.

528
00:56:51,004 --> 00:56:52,872
What you said to me before...

529
00:56:55,122 --> 00:56:56,713
I cannot forget it.

530
00:56:59,876 --> 00:57:01,142
You said...

531
00:57:04,055 --> 00:57:06,539
that I do not love you.

532
00:57:11,466 --> 00:57:14,780
Lady Hae, I...

533
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:16,428
You...

534
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:20,700
do not have to say anything.

535
00:57:25,142 --> 00:57:26,153
But...

536
00:57:28,222 --> 00:57:30,473
I was able to...

537
00:57:33,252 --> 00:57:35,124
love you more.

538
00:57:38,227 --> 00:57:40,254
That was enough.

539
00:58:01,626 --> 00:58:02,671
Myung Hee.

540
00:58:29,776 --> 00:58:31,905
Do not wake Lady Hae from her sleep.
