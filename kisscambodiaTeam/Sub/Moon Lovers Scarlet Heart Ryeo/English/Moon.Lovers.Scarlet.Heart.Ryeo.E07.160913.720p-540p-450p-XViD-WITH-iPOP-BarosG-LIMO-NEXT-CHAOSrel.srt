4
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,510
Though you were once
to be the king's woman

5
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,780
you are merely a court lady here.

6
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,110
Yes, I understand.

7
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,990
I will do my best to adjust quickly.

8
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,850
Do you know how to serve tea?

9
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,540
Do you know how to differentiate herbs
or how to apply makeup?

10
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,370
That happens to be what I'm best at.

11
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,040
I'm licensed in skincare and
know how to apply makeup well.

12
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,820
I can hand-make my own makeup, as well.

13
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,930
I think that Damiwon
will suit me very well.

14
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,840
You know how to read
and write, don't you?

15
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,050
No.

16
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,970
You really don't know?

17
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,510
You're still here?

18
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,400
I was very curious about this place.

19
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,370
I think I'll be fine here.

20
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,540
They are all things I'm very good at.

21
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,870
Ah, did you know I was
good at applying makeup?

22
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,980
You didn't, did you?

23
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,950
Regardless, I'll be living at
the palace, so come visit often.

24
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,180
Oh, I forgot.

25
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,850
You were very startled
because of me, weren't you?

26
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,160
I never even got to thank you.

27
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,050
Still, isn't it a relief that I
didn't have to marry the king?

28
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,300
You could have died.

29
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,490
If the cut were a little deeper,
you would have died.

30
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,410
I didn't die.

31
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,630
Did you think about what it's like
to live with a scar on your body?

32
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,650
Are you happy to be a court lady?

33
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,040
You may never be able to step foot
outside this palace ever again.

34
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,450
Are you excited?

35
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,210
Why did you have to go so far?

36
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,230
Why didn't you just marry the king then?

37
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,600
I don't know! I just don't!

38
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:54,210
"If you can't do anything, just close
your eyes and enter the king's room."

39
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,590
That's what I told myself.

40
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,670
I just couldn't do it.

41
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:07,520
No one can save me but myself.

42
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,310
That's what I thought
and that's why I did it.

43
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,630
Once I came to...

44
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:19,930
this happened.

45
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,480
You stupid girl.

46
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,330
Don't do this again.

47
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,560
I won't ever forgive you.

48
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,920
Where is this place?

49
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,990
<i>It's a lake called Dongji.</i>

50
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,300
<i>It's the first place
the sun rises in the palace.</i>

51
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,990
<i>What kind of place is the palace?</i>

52
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,700
<i>A place that's hard to enter
and even harder to leave.</i>

53
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,530
<i>You end up dying if you trust anyone.</i>

54
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,490
<i>You'll live if you remain alert
and wary of those closest to you.</i>

55
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,630
<i>It is a place like that.</i>

56
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,420
<i>Well... then it seems like you
don't know everything either.</i>

57
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,880
<i>Everyone here is alone.</i>

58
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,250
<i>That is one thing I know for certain.</i>

59
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,940
I am not alone, so I'm all right.

60
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,670
You're not alone?

61
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,670
You're here, Your Highness.
How am I alone?

62
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,470
You'll be in trouble if you
become more reckless like that.

63
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,370
Everyone who lives here is a person too.

64
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,680
So, I will be able to get through it.

65
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,310
I suppose you will.

66
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,540
Now that a noisy thing like you is here,
I suppose the palace won't be boring.

67
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,180
- Brother
- Yes?

68
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,490
I will ask them to look for
another match for you.

69
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,490
One political marriage is more than enough

70
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,660
Then should I kill all of them?

71
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,900
Or should we be like before,

72
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,500
being chased by Queen Yoo

73
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,230
running here and there

74
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,900
wandering from place to place again

75
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,680
Yeon Hwa, I have forgotten about it.
Mother too.

76
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,410
So you should do the same

77
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,480
Look at 3rd brother Yo

78
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,550
He married prime minister Park Kyung Kyu's daughter

79
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,280
He even expanded his power to Later Baekje

80
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,190
to increase his chances of becoming king

81
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,120
If the queen drives Crown Prince Mu out,

82
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,590
it's obvious how we will end up

83
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,590
We die, or we get cast out.

84
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,700
Yet you're asking me to forget about it?

85
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,360
How?

86
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,640
What about you?

87
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,510
I thought you liked So

88
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,010
Not just 4th brother but to anyone else

89
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,080
who aims for the throne,

90
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,210
I will cross my heart.

91
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,250
Whether it’s an arranged marriage or I’m sold off,

92
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,050
I will not enter into a marriage that does not help you

93
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,660
Yeon Hwa,

94
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,130
can't you stop and live freely?

95
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,960
There is only one way for me to live freely

96
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,370
Become the king, Brother.

97
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,410
Due to my illness

98
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:29,120
I missed the morning assembly again

99
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,100
There are surely many complaints to dethrone me

100
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,120
Everyone is living with an illness

101
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,660
Don't blame yourself too much

102
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,560
I feel like a burden with this illness

103
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,730
Standing in a position that does not belong to me

104
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,930
Greedy for the throne

105
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,600
I've told you clearly.

106
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,100
Your Highness was born under the star of a king

107
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,510
Why would I fool everyone in Goryeo?

108
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:58,080
So please, just focus on your illness

109
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,630
Grand General.

110
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,430
All right, you can rest.

111
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,210
- You've all been well, right?
- Yes.

112
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,050
All right. Good.

113
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,830
Wow! It is still a brilliant place.

114
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,470
You refused to give that to your father.

115
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,570
How can you be so unreasonable?

116
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,220
This is for someone else.

117
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:44,240
Everything good and delicious
should be for your father.

118
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,800
Your subject Park Soo Kyung
has come to see you, Your Majesty.

119
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,000
Have you arrived, Grand General?

120
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,080
I should have washed up before coming.
I apologize, Your Majesty.

121
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,640
You could not come to the capital
and I left my lacking son in your care.

122
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,370
I feel very badly for that.

123
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:34,720
The 4th Prince is very talented,
so I enjoyed teaching him martial arts.

124
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,130
If it were not for the scar on his face

125
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,660
he would not be lacking
as a Crown Prince.

126
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:48,010
Then, are you saying the Crown Prince
is lacking in his martial arts skills?

127
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:53,520
Prince Wang Moo is far too gentle
compared to the strength of his fists.

128
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,730
I wonder how much
he would have had to fight

129
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,780
in the political world of the palace.

130
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,990
I think the war zone might be better off.

131
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,880
Still, there are many things
to be learned while in the palace.

132
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,500
What? What are they?

133
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,080
Some tact and sense.

134
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,570
Then, is that what Prince Wang So
has been learning here?

135
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,290
Tact and sense.

136
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,850
- Gosh, you are ignorant.
- Just leave.

137
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,120
Jung, you gave me a horse.
What will you give this time?

138
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,520
Just try to win.

139
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,980
I will give you any trinkets you want.

140
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,300
You promised.

141
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,060
Jung, come at me, then.

142
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:55,440
I don't know about anyone else,
but I will beat you, 10th brother!

143
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,140
I cannot lose today.

144
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,740
Jung, don't use too much strength.

145
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,520
- Let us be off, my brothers!
- Hold on. Wait.

146
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,110
Thirdly, if you place the objects
on the water's surface...

147
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,570
Oh my. Would you look at that?

148
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,510
I hear you're burying yourself in books

149
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,630
rather than practicing
your military skills.

150
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:01,580
I think I've learned enough of the
martial arts from you, Grand General.

151
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,210
I should fill up my brain now.

152
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,550
You killed multiple men in one day
and set them all on fire.

153
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,330
They all deserved to die.

154
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,130
It seems like you've read
many books in all this time.

155
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:25,110
You now have the ability to determine
who deserves to die and who doesn't.

156
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,170
No matter how many times
you die and are reborn...

157
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:35,850
you will eventually have to
pay for what you've done.

158
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,030
It was you who taught me how to kill.

159
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,810
I taught you how to kill only
in order to protect someone.

160
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:45,270
I stopped trouble in the royal family,
so I protected the nation.

161
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:52,170
What is the real reason
you want to live in Songak?

162
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,020
If you go back to Shinju now,
you will be able to control that family.

163
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,150
I am a prince too.

164
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,540
I should know how the royal family works.

165
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:08,660
What does it mean to be king that
Mother and my siblings are so persistent?

166
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,470
Then, will you return once you
are done observing them?

167
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,980
Must I return?

168
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,540
The prince that remains
living in Songak...

169
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,250
there is only one.

170
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,280
The one who will sit on the throne.

171
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,540
Please think carefully.

172
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,040
What is the real reason
you want to live in Songak?

173
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,570
How is your headache?

174
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,590
It does feel a bit better since
I had the chrysanthemum tea.

175
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,790
However, it is still there.

176
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,840
It does not get better,
though 10 days have passed.

177
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,730
I should not have high expectations.

178
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,640
I will add some more herbs to the pouch.

179
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,840
There is nothing as good for headaches
as chrysanthemum.

180
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,520
Thank you.

181
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,080
How are you doing, Soo?

182
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,930
Are you adjusting well?

183
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,140
You were a noble and
now you're in the palace.

184
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,100
Nothing must be easy. How is it?

185
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,280
It is not hard. I'm doing well.

186
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,740
Ah, I will make you more soaps if you
enjoyed what I made you last time.

187
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,160
I can apply makeup for you, as well.

188
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,600
I think some of the makeup has streaked.

189
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,870
You are not ready to step in.

190
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,890
Do not get in the way and step outside.

191
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,380
Yes.

192
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:59,110
Now that I think about it,
she suits the Damiwon well.

193
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:02,060
The soaps she made were very nice.

194
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,710
I will watch over her closely.

195
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,630
How are you, by the way?

196
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,260
Is Queen Yoo treating you
poorly as usual?

197
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,450
It does not bother me.
You do not need to worry.

198
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:18,090
Your stomach pains are like my headaches.

199
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,250
That's why I bring this up.

200
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,720
We both have these chronic pains
because of the same thing.

201
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,260
I should at least worry about you.

202
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,560
You need to go see the doctor.

203
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,850
I know the doctor is for royals,
but if it were for you...

204
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,750
Thank you for your great blessings.

205
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,640
<i>Ice, ice, ice!</i>

206
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,670
<i>I feel like there are insects on my body!</i>

207
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,270
<i>Ice! Get me ice now!</i>

208
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,930
<i>Ice! Ice!</i>

209
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,610
<i>Ice!</i>

210
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,330
The doctor! Bring the doctor!

211
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,820
My body is being torn apart.

212
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,670
There are insects all over my body.

213
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,820
That looks like atopic eczema.

214
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,410
No, you can't do that!

215
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,700
- You can't do that!
- Move!

216
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,110
You can't use cold water.

217
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,380
What do you know?

218
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,700
Doesn't it itch more when you
eat beans or cold food?

219
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,140
Also, when you're tired and sweaty.

220
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,190
You can't use blankets with down.

221
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,780
How do you know that?

222
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,510
Please trust me.

223
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,480
Use warm water to wash.

224
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,610
Cold water will make it itch more.

225
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,330
Do you have any cold leaves, by chance?

226
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,570
Aloe, green tea... oh, peppermint leaves!

227
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,500
Get the temperature right first.

228
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:19,490
The peppermint leaves will
help with the itching.

229
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,620
What do you think you're doing?

230
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,680
All of you, get out!

231
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,780
Get out!

232
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,570
My mother had the same illness
so I've seen it for a long time.

233
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,250
If he sits in a bath...

234
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,280
This is not a place for you.

235
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,100
Court Lady Oh.

236
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,280
Crown Prince! Are you all right?

237
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,950
Please breathe and calm down.

238
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,680
Stay calm.

239
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,680
"Sage of Tea."

240
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,590
It is a book written by medical expert
Lu Yu from the Tang Dynasty.

241
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,880
"Newly Revised
Materia Medica: Tang Edition."

242
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,330
It's a medical book on
the use of over 100 medicines.

243
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,180
"Supplement to Materia Medica."

244
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,570
It is a book about many medicinal plants
by Chen Cang Qi from the Tang Dynasty.

245
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,630
It's a record of the use of plants.

246
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,360
If you had read all of these books,
you would not have made today's mistakes.

247
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,450
How could you dare to
touch the Crown Prince?

248
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,470
He was suffering so much.

249
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:40,680
I knew how to help him.
I couldn't stand idly by.

250
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,520
How did you know that peppermint leaves
were good for itching of the skin?

251
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,910
You're illiterate so
you couldn't have read it.

252
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:52,110
My mother has the same illness,
so I've seen her use the treatments.

253
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,020
You must never speak of
the Crown Prince's illness.

254
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,950
You will not see the sunrise
tomorrow if you do.

255
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,880
Do you understand?

256
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,300
Yes.

257
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,720
Drink up.

258
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,750
Drink.

259
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,300
You drink up too.

260
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,410
Wow.

261
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,930
I don't want to do this.

262
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,630
It's not like I'm an ox or something.

263
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,360
I thought nobles were treated
differently even as court ladies.

264
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,070
This is very different, indeed.

265
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,930
- Should I just run away?
- Run?

266
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:03,140
Where in Goryeo do you think
you can hide from the king?

267
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,920
Who... who said I was
really going to run?

268
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,770
I was only saying that
it would be nice to.

269
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:14,200
You're a court lady of Damiwon,
yet you act like a royal court minister.

270
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,020
You don't use your hands or your body.
You're always using that head of yours.

271
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,280
No matter how I look at it,
this place doesn't suit me.

272
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,420
No one recognizes my talent.

273
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,130
I am overflowing with talent.

274
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,860
Have you ever demonstrated your talent?

275
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,810
Even with the Crown Prince,
I was correct about everything but...

276
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:40,130
Anyhow, you need a good boss in order
to get recognition in the workplace.

277
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,070
It's not going to work out this time.

278
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,740
You don't happen to know about the
Crown Prince's illness, do you?

279
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,900
Huh? What?

280
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,300
I've never heard of that.

281
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,620
Watch what you say.

282
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,270
This time it won't end with
just being sent to the Damiwon.

283
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,280
You know too, Your Highness.

284
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,540
But the atopic... I mean, itchy skin.

285
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,820
It won't get better just by making
a fuss as if he's going to die.

286
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,930
He just needs to take care
of himself and eat well.

287
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,700
Do you think Court Lady Oh is
trying to keep me in check?

288
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,360
Because the Crown Prince might favor me.

289
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,220
What if you had made the
Crown Prince worse?

290
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,250
You'd already be dead.

291
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,650
You should know she let you off easy.

292
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,190
Maybe you're right.

293
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,970
Just by seeing how you water trees

294
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,280
you're not overflowing with,
but actually lacking talent.

295
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,290
Very much lacking.

296
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,310
Whenever you are growing something,
you have to give it a name.

297
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,600
You must make friends with it.

298
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,090
Why would I name a tree?
I'm even confused about my name.

299
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:59,290
Oh, that pine tree means "the best."

300
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,610
That one can be named Best.

301
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,500
And this mulberry tree,
the fruits make one pass gas.

302
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,290
Fartie?

303
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,800
Are you making fun of me right now?

304
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,640
When I was in Shinju,
I named a white birch tree Pat Pat.

305
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,610
Three men could hang from it
and it would not budge.

306
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:34,610
Goodness, your friend
must be very famous.

307
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,240
I burned it down myself a few years ago.

308
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,410
It's gone now.

309
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,250
What?

310
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:48,280
It was cold and the
wolves were gathering.

311
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,230
It happened to catch my eye.

312
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,530
Forget it. Why am I saying this to you?

313
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,740
Don't think about running.

314
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,870
Stay faithful to what
you've decided to do.

315
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,270
Got it?

316
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,910
You should work for your living.

317
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:32,760
I thought he was being
too good to me lately.

318
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:39,460
Soo, how long do I
have to stay like this?

319
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,080
Wait a little longer.

320
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,950
Soo.

321
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,020
My fingers are tingling and
it feels like there are insects.

322
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,640
Gosh, just sit there and be patient.

323
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,640
They say if the snapweed is left
until the first snow falls

324
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,110
your first love will come to you.

325
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:56,970
Really?

326
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,830
First love, you say.

327
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,200
It's a cold day...

328
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,910
Chun Il...

329
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,500
Chun Il... what is this again?

330
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,090
"Bong" as in the peak.

331
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,510
"Chun Il Bong Hwa."

332
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,510
It means that flowers have bloomed
on a warm spring day.

333
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:03,200
What is all of this?

334
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,840
It's my homework.

335
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:10,800
I didn't know how to read,
so I used the wrong herb.

336
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,960
You don't know how to read?

337
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,270
Well...

338
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,650
Honestly, I haven't been
able to read since I hurt my head.

339
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,830
Then, how did you read that poem
I gave you before?

340
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,340
Myung Hee read it to me.

341
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:33,790
The green willow tree is by the water.
It was that poem.

342
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,450
I have so much to repay to Lady Hae.

343
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,250
What?

344
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:47,220
You are so hard to meet.
I was going to write you a letter.

345
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,500
You cannot read, so now what?

346
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,810
Don't worry.
I'll be able to read it all soon.

347
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,020
Soo.

348
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,080
Draw it down like this.

349
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,070
It's the Amur Adonis plant.

350
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:38,260
It's a medicinal plant that helps if
used well, but can also be poisonous.

351
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,310
I see.

352
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,740
This...

353
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,880
What is this character?

354
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,580
My name.

355
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,270
Wook.

356
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:25,570
It means the sun rising in the morning.

357
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,140
The sun rising in the morning, Wook.

358
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:05,270
The color red protects you
from misfortune.

359
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,440
It also symbolizes a joyful relationship.

360
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,980
Can you promise me?

361
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,150
That you will never take it off.

362
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:38,420
I will do whatever it takes to
return you to where you belong.

363
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,500
So...

364
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,670
please wait.

365
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,340
I know how you feel.

366
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,010
There's no need for you to rush.

367
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,860
I am doing fine here.

368
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,550
Wang...

369
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,430
Wook.

370
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,300
The morning sun, Wook.

371
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,940
<i>Even hearing the word "wait"
can make me happy.</i>

372
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,490
<i>I like that person.</i>

373
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,470
<i>If I were with him...</i>

374
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:33,370
<i>I think I would be okay being Hae Soo
instead of Go Ha Jin.</i>

375
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:45,020
<i>You'll be able to live well.</i>

376
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,680
<i>Hae Soo.</i>

377
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,500
Hey, kids.

378
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,830
Thank you.

379
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,860
- Don't eat too fast.
- Yes, sir.

380
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,880
What do you think you're doing?

381
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,850
Do we look like pigs to you?

382
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,890
What?

383
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:50,120
We may have lost to Goryeo and we
may be suffering because of the drought.

384
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,740
But we are still human beings.

385
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,590
Do not dare to think
you can look down on us.

386
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,160
That's not it...

387
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,690
I only wanted to show what
the drought was doing to the people.

388
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:04,180
It's not enough for Goryeo aristocrats
to live in luxury.

389
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,900
I hear they keep dirty
and low things as art.

390
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,880
You latch on to people like that.

391
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,650
And you make a mockery
of the suffering of the citizens.

392
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:15,960
You've sold out your pride
to the government.

393
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,950
You lowly insect.

394
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,490
Insect?

395
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,590
Hey! Hey, stop right there.

396
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,190
Your Highness.

397
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:46,020
General.

398
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:51,930
It's a relief that you look so well.

399
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:54,410
The Foreign Minister wishes
to see you, Your Highness.

400
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:55,550
Foreign Minister?

401
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:01,210
That betrayer Park Young Gyu has
become Foreign Minister already?

402
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,210
He's climbed up quite high.

403
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,590
All right, let's go.

404
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,650
This way.

405
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,330
Gosh, she misunderstands all on her own
and then disappears?

406
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,810
Was she a refugee?

407
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:30,130
All right, let's have a drink now.

408
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,460
Yes, Crown Prince.

409
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:50,160
Eun, you've grown one year older.
Let me pour you a drink.

410
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,240
Thank you for congratulating me.

411
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,200
Eun, we'll pour you a drink too.

412
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,570
Oh, sure.

413
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,780
What kind of alcohol is that?

414
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,440
Yeon Hwa.

415
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,060
You organized this gathering for us.
I don't know what will happen tonight.

416
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,780
It was more fun for me.

417
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,450
Once I marry and leave here,
I won't be able to do it for you at all.

418
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:21,240
Marry? What do you mean, you're marrying?

419
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:26,520
The king is looking into a powerful
family somewhere far away from Songak.

420
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,560
Not even a royal family,
but just a powerful family.

421
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,090
That's nonsense.

422
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:35,600
I suppose I'm not good enough
and no royal family wants me.

423
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:41,340
Let's talk about this later with Mother.

424
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,350
One more drink. Drink it all.

425
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,830
Wait, why?

426
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,100
Why is it that I'm the
only one with a cup?

427
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,310
That can't be possible.

428
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,190
You'll have to drink this too.

429
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,800
Wait. Those people...

430
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,400
Isn't this a different drink?

431
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:12,840
- Oh my!
- You drink so well!

432
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,720
What a great night.

433
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,910
I'll get going now.

434
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,740
One more. Here you go.

435
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,200
Drink it down.

436
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,170
What important thing did you
need to talk to me about?

437
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,210
You... just be mine.

438
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,420
- What?
- You could the Queen of Goryeo.

439
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,080
But the lady of a powerful household?

440
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,860
I can't bear to see that.

441
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:43,190
Then, how high do your dreams go?

442
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,320
My dreams?

443
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:50,270
You want to argue that
even in your desperate situation.

444
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,290
My dream...

445
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,500
is Goryeo.

446
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:01,070
You are very fearless.

447
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:05,090
I know you want Wook on the throne.

448
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:09,360
Even if your brother becomes king,
you are still only a princess.

449
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,610
If your husband is a king,
that changes things.

450
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:16,810
However, I would not be a first wife,
so I cannot be a queen.

451
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:24,300
Can you give up your
past marriage for me?

452
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,170
I don't give up what is mine
in order to gain a girl.

453
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,790
Let go.

454
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,900
Do you have another choice besides me?

455
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,800
Don't you get tired of it?

456
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,150
Living like a shameful coward.

457
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:03,510
You should be getting tired of it by now.

458
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,460
You're very persistent.

459
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:10,280
I see you're still butting into
things you shouldn't be.

460
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,530
We'll talk later.

461
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,210
Thank you.

462
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:27,440
And please don't tell Wook about this.

463
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:31,620
Take Wang Yo off of your mind.

464
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:34,850
You won't be able to get
what you want out of him.

465
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,120
It is a foolish calculation.

466
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:42,640
If you're going to give me that warning,
show me a better option.

467
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:50,190
Do you have interest in
being considered by me?

468
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,750
Lady Oh, I've finished everything
you've instructed me to do.

469
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,760
Get going now.

470
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,520
I'm letting you go because the
Crown Prince specifically asked for you.

471
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,020
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

472
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:27,040
I know my way home.

473
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,400
Your Highness!

474
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,400
It's you, Hae Soo!

475
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:47,150
Why do you look so pretty today?

476
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:55,260
I can see two and three of you.

477
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,560
There's Hae Soo everywhere!

478
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,780
Oh no...

479
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,040
Hold on and follow me.

480
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,570
Where are you going?

481
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,270
Where is everyone?

482
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:08,190
Baek Ah, did everyone go off
to hang out without telling us?

483
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,510
That would be a relief.

484
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,530
I'm worried they're off causing trouble.

485
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,040
Please move out of the way.

486
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,560
What... what are you?

487
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,720
Aren't you Soon Deok? Park Soon Deok?

488
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,480
Do you know this bear?

489
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,860
This is Grand General Park's
daughter, Soon Deok.

490
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,950
Daughter?

491
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,080
Wow.

492
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,780
Wow!

493
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,390
Isn't this me?

494
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:47,700
It is.

495
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:53,530
Soo, you made all of this?

496
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,680
Your Highness.

497
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,490
Thank you for becoming
my first friend in Goryeo.
subtitles ripped,synced and added missing lines by riri13

498
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:05,660
After Myung Hee passed away,
I was comforted thanks to you.

499
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:14,080
So, I wanted to give you a special gift.

500
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:22,040
<i>Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.</i>

501
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:27,960
<i>To my friend, the 10th Prince.
Happy birthday to you.</i>

502
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,170
<i>Why were you born?
Why were you born?</i>

503
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:39,480
<i>You are so ugly. Why were you born?</i>

504
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,440
<i>Why were you born?</i>

505
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:46,450
<i>Why were you born?</i>

506
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:49,710
<i>Why were you born?</i>

507
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:55,780
<i>You are so ugly. Why were you born?</i>

508
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:02,300
Wow! Eun, you're enjoying this
all by yourself?

509
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,160
- I'm hurt.
- What are you all doing here?

510
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,310
Soo, are you going to
sing for my birthday?

511
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,710
Baek Ah is right.
You were going to keep this to yourself?

512
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:11,300
You can't exclude me.

513
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,810
I was the one who asked
Court Lady Oh to send Hae Soo.

514
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:17,080
You know, you're better than a gisaeng.

515
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,230
Hey, now...

516
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:23,460
I meant that she's good.

517
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:27,150
Soo, can you sing for us too?

518
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:28,370
No, she can't.

519
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:29,660
Yeah, sing.

520
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,830
- Please sing.
- Sing just once.

521
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,230
She can't!

522
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:35,750
Why are you ruining my present?

523
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:37,360
- Please sing, Soo.
- Sing, Soo.

524
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,960
- Yes, go on.
- No! Everyone leave!

525
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,000
Why are you all disrupting my gift?

526
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,110
Seriously!

527
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:03,180
<i>The days that pass by painfully.</i>

528
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:08,450
<i>In the stillness of the day and wind.</i>

529
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:15,750
<i>Because I like the sunshine, I smile.</i>

530
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:22,880
<i>Passing by so busily.</i>

531
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:28,120
<i>Even among those heartless people.</i>

532
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:35,970
<i>Because I like my friend, I smile.</i>

533
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:44,920
<i>If I find a place without loneliness...</i>

534
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:53,620
<i>come with me to that place.</i>

535
00:45:54,510 --> 00:46:00,070
<i>Let us go together, friend...</i>

536
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:16,120
<i>You should get along like this, always.</i>

537
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,760
<i>Who cares if you don't become the king?</i>

538
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:24,200
<i>Don't forget this moment, right now.</i>

539
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,330
<i>Okay?</i>

540
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:53,690
Wow!

541
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:55,630
Wow, Soo!

542
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:58,680
Soo, you are awesome.

543
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,950
I'm looking forward to my presents.

544
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:29,410
You should look forward to them.

545
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:32,670
- Be careful.
- They're cute, aren't they?

546
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:40,000
- You can leave now.
- Excuse me?

547
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:45,360
You've made the 10th Prince happy,
so you did your job as a court lady.

548
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,680
Good work.

549
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,780
I didn't do it because I'm a court lady.

550
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:51,260
Before I was a court lady,
Eun and I were--

551
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:53,590
You're not about to say that
you were friends, are you?

552
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:55,900
A prince, friends with a court lady?

553
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,310
How ridiculous would Eun look?

554
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:03,760
I'm supervising the party,
so I'll take care of it.

555
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,630
You've helped out enough, so run along.

556
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,410
I told you to go.

557
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:13,750
You are the same
as always, Your Highness.

558
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:16,600
You look at status before
looking at the person.

559
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,560
You haven't changed
since you hit Chae Ryung.

560
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,080
Would I have any reason to change?

561
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:27,150
I'm being generous with you
because of Myung Hee.

562
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,190
You should know your place.

563
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:32,920
I said it was all right.

564
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:37,230
Crown Prince.

565
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:41,040
Eun enjoys spending time with Hae Soo,
so I allowed it as a gift to him.

566
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:46,510
I'm not a very good older brother,
and I couldn't think of another present.

567
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,280
Yeon Hwa, please understand.

568
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,250
I understand what you're saying.

569
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,680
She even has the consideration
of the Crown Prince.

570
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,230
She is always very lucky.

571
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:09,750
Thank you, Crown Prince.

572
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:13,890
You saw me at my worst state.
This is the least I could do to help.

573
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:15,750
I haven't told anyone about it.

574
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:17,810
I know. I trust you.

575
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:21,380
Will you help me in the future
when I need it?

576
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:25,300
Of course, I will help you
as much as I possibly can.

577
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:27,700
- Wow!
- Do you like it?

578
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,720
I really like it.

579
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,960
Wow, isn't this jade?

580
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,280
It is very heavy.

581
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,690
It's expensive.

582
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,630
Wow, a slingshot.

583
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:43,250
This is from me, Eun.

584
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:44,860
Oh!

585
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,810
Wow, isn't this a book? A book!

586
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:53,130
A book?

587
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:56,700
Who would read this?
Why did you bring it?

588
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,350
I'll shoot you with this slingshot.

589
00:49:58,350 --> 00:49:59,760
This is very precious.

590
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,740
I like this the best.

591
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:15,500
Your Highness.

592
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:20,220
Your Highness.

593
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:25,210
What are you? The Grim Reaper?

594
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:28,500
She's the daughter of
Grand General Park, Soon Deok.

595
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,600
You don't know her?

596
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,480
Soon Deok!

597
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:42,990
- Oh my gosh!
- This fur...

598
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:46,510
it's for you.

599
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:49,540
Was it you who scared me
every year with bear fur?

600
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,500
Why would you do such a thing to me?

601
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:55,090
Your Highness! That's not it.

602
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,600
That's not it.

603
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,530
How could there be
someone so frustrating?

604
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,170
<i>You're here, Your Highness.
How am I alone?</i>

605
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,920
Why are you alone again?

606
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,830
We should all be together
on a day like today.

607
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:19,530
You should go.

608
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:22,310
It doesn't suit me
to be in a noisy place.

609
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:25,580
Hey, are your siblings
your siblings for no reason?

610
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:27,820
You have to congratulate them
on days like this.

611
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:28,880
Let's get going.

612
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,960
Let's go.

613
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,050
I don't want to be a bother.

614
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:36,640
Hurry. Come on.

615
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,970
Come on, So.

616
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:42,530
So, what did So give you?

617
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:44,200
Oh, it's fine.

618
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:47,160
I'm surprised our
4th brother came at all.

619
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,290
That's too bad.

620
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:52,520
There is a unique gift that
only So could ever give you.

621
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:54,320
What a waste.

622
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,080
Is there something like that?

623
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,490
What? He wouldn't
give me a gift like that.

624
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:12,910
Soo!

625
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:19,090
You're close to our 4th brother.
Can you help me get my gift?

626
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:21,440
How good of a gift do you want?

627
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,830
He won't give it up so easily.
It would be good to join together.

628
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:28,530
Soo, please. Come on, Soo!

629
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:30,370
All right, all right.

630
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:32,100
Come on. Hurry up.

631
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,340
Where have you been?

632
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:45,010
We were all giving Eun his presents.

633
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:51,980
I wasn't able to prepare anything.

634
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:55,820
Tell me if there's anything you want.

635
00:53:57,170 --> 00:53:59,890
Will you really give me anything?

636
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:03,970
Of course! Would the 4th Prince
go back on his word?

637
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:06,090
He would get it for you even if it were

638
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:08,210
something precious
and hard to find, right?

639
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,880
Yes, make sure to choose
something just like that.

640
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,780
I'll make sure to find it for you.

641
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:20,610
You really promise?

642
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:21,750
I said yes.

643
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:25,800
Then... show me your face
without the mask!

644
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:36,060
I've only heard things,
but I've been very curious.

645
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:38,930
We're brothers, not strangers.
Is there any reason to hide?

646
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:43,210
I really want to see how bad it is
that you are always hiding it.

647
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:44,680
Prince Eun, wait--

648
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,110
How dare a court lady get involved?

649
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,110
Just ignore them.

650
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:58,210
Must you... see it?

651
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:00,590
- So.
- That's enough.

652
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:04,910
Eun, you should feel shame
for wanting something like that.

653
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:07,270
He said he'd give me what I wanted.

654
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:09,550
Hae Soo, you said so too.

655
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:12,470
You said Wang So would give me this gift.

656
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:15,710
What? That's not what I meant.

657
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:16,780
Forget it.

658
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,470
So!

659
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:11,900
Apologize to So right away.

660
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:13,840
You made a big mistake.

661
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,170
You told me to ask for it.
Now look at what has happened!

662
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,110
I didn't say anything wrong.

663
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:21,400
I told you it would be a gift
you wouldn't forget.

664
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:24,310
It may be a joke to all of you.

665
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:26,580
That's not how it is for So.

666
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,750
If he hates it so much,
he didn't have to take off the mask.

667
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,220
He has too much pride.

668
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:38,410
Every person has a weak spot.

669
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:41,490
Why is it that you are always
poking at people's weak spots?

670
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:42,630
I am?

671
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:47,340
So, when I pointed out that your
in-laws household was far too lowly

672
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:51,200
and asked you what nerve you had
to continue to stay as Crown Prince

673
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,220
you must have felt offended.

674
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:58,090
You speak such words so carelessly.

675
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,130
Should I teach you a lesson
about why you should not?

676
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:12,390
Your Highness!

677
00:58:13,810 --> 00:58:16,010
Wait! Wait!

678
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:19,440
Was it not enough?

679
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,350
Why? Do they want to
play more jokes on me?

680
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:25,040
That's not what happened.
You're mistaken.

681
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,920
Don't leave.

682
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,680
If you leave like this

683
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,840
the 10th Prince loses his
chance to apologize.

684
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,730
You will all grow apart.

685
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:37,160
You're brothers, right?

686
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:41,860
Your Highness...

687
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:50,780
Look at me.

688
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:54,930
Look at me properly.

689
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,600
Your eyes...

690
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:09,980
That look in your eyes...

691
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,660
I hate it like crazy.

702
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,690
<i>I'm going to ask the king
to let you leave.</i>

703
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:58,990
<i>I truly hope it rains.</i>

704
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:01,010
<i>Don't ask to play with me again.</i>

705
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:02,480
<i>Don't look for me!</i>

706
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,250
<i>Heaven's will? Yeah right.</i>

707
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:06,010
<i>You'll become king if it rains.</i>

708
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:07,990
<i>You need to become confident on your own.</i>

709
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:11,350
<i>I came for my seat.</i>
