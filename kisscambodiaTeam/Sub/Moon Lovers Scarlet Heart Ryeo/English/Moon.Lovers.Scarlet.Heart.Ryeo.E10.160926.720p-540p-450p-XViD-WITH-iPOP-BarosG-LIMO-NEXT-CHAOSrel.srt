<i>[Episode 10]</i>
Don't push me away.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,220
Don't tell me leave.

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,020
Don't tell me that I bring misfortune
and that I'm an animal.

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,460
At the very least,
you can't do that to me.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,610
You are... my person.

9
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,330
I am not your person, Your Highness.

10
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,890
You are my person.

11
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,530
You belong to me. You are mine!

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,290
Without my permission,
you cannot leave me.

13
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,710
You cannot die either.

14
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,280
You are completely my person.

15
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,580
What's going on?

16
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,380
That's not possible.

17
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,560
You must have seen wrong.

18
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,170
What do you mean she left the palace?

19
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,290
How could she?

20
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,090
I'm sure. How could I not recognize her?

21
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,320
I just checked with the gatekeeper.

22
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,390
How could a court lady leave the palace?

23
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,190
Would So care about those things?

24
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,030
He probably took her out by force.

25
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,150
If they get caught,
Soo will be the one who ends up dead.

26
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,560
Let's go find her now.

27
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,720
Get me a horse too and let's--

28
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,050
- You stay here.
- What?

29
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,910
It won't be good for you
to leave at night.

30
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,710
Go on in. I'll find them.

31
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,070
Thanks for thinking of me,
but I cannot just walk away.

32
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,180
If it is known that she left the palace

33
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,710
I really don't know
what will happen to Soo.

34
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,280
We should find them together.

35
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,790
All right.

36
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,960
I still thought of you as a young child.

37
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,580
Sorry.

38
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,450
I trust you.

39
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,900
<i>Neither of us will be safe anymore,
Your Highness.</i>

40
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,210
<i>Then, should we run away now?</i>

41
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,100
<i>If you wanted to,
I would do it.</i>

42
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:26,340
Even if I were to leave Songak someday,
I wanted to bring you here.

43
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,740
I was always forced to leave here.

44
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,090
I still don't know why I had to leave.

45
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,460
I have never brought misfortune.

46
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,130
I don't slaughter animals for fun.

47
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,760
I don't use my sword
carelessly on people either.

48
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,780
Yet why do I still have to leave?

49
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,800
<i>It was a hallucination.</i>

50
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,470
<i>It must have been just a hallucination.</i>

51
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,440
<i>I need to quit panicking</i>

52
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,440
<i>and try to stop him from going berserk.</i>

53
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:45,140
I want you to live with
your heart at ease, Your Highness.

54
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,810
Even if it's out of
the palace somewhere...

55
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,260
live without bring wronged or
spilling blood, and live life smiling.

56
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,390
I will... if you go with me.

57
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,490
I am a court lady.

58
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,880
I have to live in the palace.

59
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,020
Then I will not leave either.

60
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,490
Also...

61
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,710
I have feelings for another.

62
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,450
Baek Ah?

63
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,340
No, it's not Baek Ah.

64
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,020
It's fine then.
As long as it's not Baek Ah.

65
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:37,510
If it were any another man,
I might have killed him.

66
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,760
What?

67
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,430
When I called you mine on the day
that Yeon Hwa was beating you

68
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,450
I already considered you
my person on that day.

69
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,700
You saw me for who I was.

70
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,850
There was no need for
explanations or excuses.

71
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,560
You say you're afraid of me?
I don't believe it.

72
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,630
You are my only confidante.

73
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,630
So, I am not sorry for anything.

74
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,500
Not for kissing you

75
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,710
or bringing you out here.

76
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,840
Also...

77
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,490
threatening you not to have
feelings for another man...

78
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,490
I am not sorry at all.

79
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,780
Take this.

80
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,630
I have long wanted to give you
something like this.

81
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,360
I was only trying to help you,
Your Highness.

82
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,590
I never asked you for your heart.

83
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,220
Try running away from me then.

84
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,030
You can throw it away if you don't want it.

85
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,080
Soo!

86
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,350
Soo!

87
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,290
How did you know to come?

88
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,130
Are they already looking for me
at the palace?

89
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,350
Thankfully only Wook and I know.

90
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,920
Others will find out soon.

91
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,080
Let's get going now.

92
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,480
Gosh...

93
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,230
What are you doing?

94
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,150
I brought her out so I'll be
the one who takes her back.

95
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,520
If anyone sees you two
going back together

96
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,270
people will start talking.

97
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,720
That's the bigger problem.

98
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,540
Soo.

99
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,070
The king has already given her to me.

100
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,740
It's only right
that I take responsibility.

101
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,030
Gave her to you?

102
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,060
I will go with the 4th Prince.

103
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,040
Don't worry and return.

104
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,040
He says he will take responsibility,
so you can go back.

105
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,650
You will go with him?

106
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,670
Yes.

107
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,200
You'd better stick to your word.

108
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,600
You cannot let Soo get hurt.

109
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,190
I don't want that either.

110
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,800
Wook, you can't let them go.

111
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,080
There's no guarantee
So will go to the palace.

112
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,060
I won't let him get away with it
if he doesn't.

113
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,880
What?

114
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,740
This is the last time
I send her away like this.

115
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,170
Court Lady Oh, I...

116
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:16,510
I dragged her out unexpectedly.
Do not blame her.

117
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,020
Are you saying you left the palace?

118
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,390
The king had put me in charge
and asked for my help.

119
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,540
I had to go out.

120
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,930
Nevertheless, taking out
one of the king's court ladies

121
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,480
could be seen as defiance.

122
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,760
So, are you going to punish her?

123
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,640
- Must you do that?
- You should go back, Your Highness.

124
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,820
You should not be seen so there will
be less for us to explain to others.

125
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,670
I will trust in you, Court Lady Oh.

126
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,590
Your small act of kindness has moved
the 4th Prince's heart in a big way.

127
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,120
That is why I told you
that you do not suit this place.

128
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,260
You must not show kindness too easily
to anyone in the palace.

129
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,820
You must take every step as if
you are walking on very thin ice.

130
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,140
That is the only way

131
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,750
you can protect yourself.

132
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,260
What...

133
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,280
should I do now?

134
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,080
You will have to wait for the
4th Prince's feelings to cool off.

135
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,260
It's a hit!

136
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,910
It's a hit!

137
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,220
It's a hit!

138
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,720
You missed the target.
Now I've seen everything.

139
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,450
I need days like this in order
for my archery skills to advance.

140
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:40,370
I always picture someone
before I aim for the target.

141
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,860
The one who became a hero instead of me.

142
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,430
If I imagine this arrow
piercing the heart

143
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,560
of the one who dragged me
from that seat...

144
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,400
I will not miss.

145
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,810
It's a hit!

146
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,220
How about you?

147
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,930
Who is your target?

148
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,150
I have never...

149
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,590
shot this arrow with anyone in mind.

150
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,520
People who have no clear target
like you are easier to sway.

151
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,600
I will be leaving Songak now.

152
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,180
The king is sending me away to die,
so I'll have to come back alive.

153
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,950
You will be safe and secure.

154
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:27,960
Of course. I will return just fine.

155
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,590
So, think carefully while I am away.

156
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,860
Who will it be fun to target?

157
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,670
You and I...

158
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,970
don't we have some things we agree on?

159
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,640
I will return soon.

160
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:00,010
Until then, you should calculate carefully.

161
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:03,020
I will await your safe return.

162
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,810
Let's go.

163
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,140
Are you angry?

164
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:52,580
I only went to see the sunrise for
a brief moment with the 4th Prince.

165
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:58,130
I didn't want you to get into trouble,
so I returned with the 4th Prince.

166
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,150
I am not angry.

167
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,100
I am just disappointed.

168
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,700
I was always worrying and debating,
so I left you here in the Damiwon.

169
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:19,160
So got you out all in one go.

170
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:30,020
I will get the king's permission
to marry you.

171
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,610
Marriage?

172
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,360
When I heard that you had disappeared

173
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,530
I was reminded of when you entered
the palace to marry the king.

174
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,990
You don't know how much I worried
thinking that I might lose you once more.

175
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,810
I do not want to make that mistake again.

176
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,530
Just like Lady Hae said...

177
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,940
I have never been able to sleep well.

178
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:05,470
The expectations on me are heavy
and the future worries me.

179
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,510
Even going to sleep peacefully
feels like a crime to me.

180
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,660
To a person like me,

181
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:16,710
the one who brought back laughter, joy...

182
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:21,210
And the poem...

183
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,510
It was you.

184
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,360
I want to leave the palace,
go to Hwangju, and live happily with you.

185
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,590
I want to live by giving you
the love I never gave to Lady Hae.

186
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,870
Soo...

187
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,950
will you be my wife?

188
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,040
<i>He won't change.</i>

189
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,470
<i>He won't hurt me.</i>

190
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:57,130
<i>I could be happy with him.</i>

191
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,090
<i>If Gwangjong kills him...</i>

192
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,050
Do you no longer want to be with me?

193
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,570
No, it's not that!

194
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:14,640
Then... do you not trust my promise?

195
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,410
That's not it.

196
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,450
Then will you give me an answer?

197
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,540
Will you marry me?

198
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,300
What is going on here?

199
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:47,810
The girl who hid while
the princes bathed was you!

200
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,810
I'm sorry, Court Lady Oh.

201
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,570
Court Lady, I will explain.

202
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,490
If this secret meeting were exposed...

203
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,060
who do you think would be killed first?

204
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:02,060
This place will be shut down soon.

205
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,900
Those having relations with a court lady

206
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,250
will be harshly punished,
regardless of status.

207
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,210
Please remember this.

208
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,460
Let's go.

209
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,970
I want you to leave the palace with me.

210
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,130
What?

211
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,570
The doctor recommended
that I leave the palace

212
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,400
to recuperate due to my bad health.

213
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:39,040
Let's go to my
hometown together, all right?

214
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,220
I was aware of your relationship
with Prince Wang Wook.

215
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,940
Avoiding him is the
right thing to do now.

216
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,940
The 8th Prince...

217
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,310
has asked me to marry him,
and I'm thinking of saying yes.

218
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,940
Think of the 4th Prince!

219
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,530
Do you think you can survive
between the two princes?

220
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:04,290
If either of them has a change of heart,
your life will be in danger.

221
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,780
The 8th Prince is different.

222
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,020
- He will never change.
- No!

223
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,590
The palace is a place that makes people

224
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,420
turn their backs
on all kinds of promises.

225
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,430
That nameless general
whom I had given my heart to?

226
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,770
Yes.

227
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,310
As you might have guessed,
he is sitting on the throne.

228
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:28,880
At one time he wanted to marry me,
but he had to protect the throne.

229
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,580
So, he forgot the lowly daughter of an
herbal medicine seller from a small town.

230
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,110
Still, I wanted to be by his side.

231
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:39,330
I made a promise to live
as a court lady, not a woman.

232
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,170
I make tea and wash his hair.

233
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,830
I put his clothes on for him.

234
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,050
I call my former lover "Your Majesty."

235
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,690
I wash the bodies of the women
who will become his.

236
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,320
Soo, take a step back
and take a good look.

237
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,940
You could be in danger
if you don't leave now.

238
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:15,390
The 8th Prince asked me to
leave the palace and go to Hwangju.

239
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,440
As long as he has no greed for the throne

240
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,840
I know we can be happy.

241
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,930
I trust him.

242
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,640
I came to see if you were all right.

243
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,340
I will speak to Court Lady Oh.

244
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,260
You should rest up today.

245
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,370
Your Highness.

246
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,780
Come inside.

247
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,160
I'll help you.

248
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,930
<i>It's not that I'm scared of you
or that I don't like you.</i>

249
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,660
<i>I'm worried.</i>

250
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:57,550
Most people...

251
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:02,270
when someone helps them
through hard times

252
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,680
they hold that person very dear.

253
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,550
They believe that person is
the only person on their side.

254
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,640
That person...

255
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,220
is called a friend.

256
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,400
Whether it is friendship or love,
all affection is affection, but...

257
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,700
It is different. It is different.

258
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:32,050
I believe you are mistaken
over that difference.

259
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,390
So, I'm worried.

260
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,740
I'm worried about you instead.

261
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,830
I don't have all those
different types of affection.

262
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,740
Whether it's friendship or love...

263
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,240
it's all the same to me.

264
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,710
It's all one thing.

265
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,550
You seem to be trying to push me away.

266
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,820
That kind of method
is not going to work on me.

267
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,190
I told you to be prepared.

268
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,770
Don't worry.

269
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,630
I won't do that
without your permission anymore.

270
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,500
Soo!

271
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:08,990
Cham cham cham!

272
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,800
Oh, you got much better.

273
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,480
I would be very stupid if I didn't
improve after getting hit that much.

274
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,500
Cham cham cham!

275
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,140
Yes!

276
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:19,130
Here, you can hit me hard.

277
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,360
I would get taken away if someone
saw a court lady hitting a prince.

278
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,950
Speaking of, I was so scared when I
saw you being taken by my 4th brother.

279
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,470
You didn't get hurt, did you?

280
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,620
Where did he take you anyway?

281
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,900
He just took me for a horseback ride
to get some air.

282
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,550
It was very fun.

283
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,860
So has always done things his way.

284
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,150
I don't like it.

285
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,640
Try to understand
your brother a little bit.

286
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,290
You grew up with a lot of love,
Your Highness.

287
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:49,340
You brother did not.

288
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,860
He has no family that he's close to.

289
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,580
Kindness from people is not easy to get.

290
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,220
That is all earned through effort too.

291
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:02,500
Since So came to Songak,
both Mother and Yo have changed a lot.

292
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,600
You're not blaming the
4th Prince, are you?

293
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,840
I know it's not just So's fault.

294
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,470
If it were not for So

295
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,320
I wouldn't know about the trouble
Mother and Yo have caused.

296
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,100
Soo, I miss the past very much.

297
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,100
You know, when we all got along.

298
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,190
Your smiles were the prettiest during your time at Wook's manor.

299
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,870
I often think that as well.

300
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,440
I want to go back.

301
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,440
What did you just say?

302
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,610
At the feast on the
9th day of the 9th lunar month

303
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,030
I will request permission from the king
to marry Hae Soo.

304
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:49,520
If Soo is allowed to leave the palace,
I will live with her in Hwangju.

305
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:55,610
I know the family has high expectations,
but I do not want the throne.

306
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,740
Palace politics only disgust me.

307
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:05,000
I only wish to live in comfort.

308
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,860
You want to give up the throne?

309
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,830
You wish to throw Mother and me aside
just to live as a normal man?

310
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,220
What about us?

311
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,260
Who will protect the Hwangbo household?

312
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:17,510
There are many ways to protect ourselves
without me having to become the king.

313
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,890
Trust me.

314
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,860
Have I ever stopped you
from doing what you wanted?

315
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,220
If you are sure of what you want,
go ahead with it.

316
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,880
Make her yours.

317
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:39,170
However, it will not be easy.
You will have to be well prepared.

318
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:43,610
Soo will be extremely
grateful to you, Mother.

319
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:55,640
You should stop him.
You should have stopped him, Mother!

320
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,770
Even I get tired of chasing the throne.

321
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,450
How do you think Wook felt?

322
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:06,790
The burden on your brother is
much heavier than you can imagine.

323
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,210
Let's leave him be to do what he wishes.

324
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,950
You were exiled for
causing the miscarriage

325
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,590
of the court lady that the king loves.

326
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,270
That was only 10 years ago.

327
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:21,540
Everyone knew it was Queen Yoo,
yet no one took our side.

328
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,520
Royal Concubine Kang,
Royal Concubine Park

329
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,420
Royal Concubine Hong,
Royal Concubine Wang!

330
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,990
If we cannot take the throne,
they will attack us again.

331
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,860
Crown Prince Moo
and the king are different.

332
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,390
The country is different, as well.

333
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:37,810
Do not panic over
unfounded fears and anxieties.

334
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:49,200
I think... it is time for me to come out
from behind your skirt, Mother.

335
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,540
Yeon Hwa.

336
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,770
I have a new goal now.

337
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,860
I will no longer be a daughter
or sister of a king.

338
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,200
I will be like a god above the king.

339
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,490
You do not need to forgive me.

340
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,840
Your Majesty, Princess Yeon Hwa
has come to see you.

341
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,940
Princess Yeon Hwa?

342
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:37,550
You told me to visit if I had
any fun stories to tell you.

343
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,660
I wanted to tell one to you today.

344
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,260
Is that so?

345
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:50,060
If you insist upon it,
I suppose I must hear it.

346
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,580
I'm looking forward to it.

347
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,160
<i>I heard there is a new one who's quite a dancer.</i>

348
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,400
<i>No one can be considered a dancer without my approval.</i>

349
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:16,940
<i>Let's see... which one...</i>

350
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,250
Who's there?

351
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,140
Have you been well, Zhong Ja Gi?

352
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,760
Why are you here?

353
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:59,220
Who hired you to follow me around?

354
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,470
Who are you?

355
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:03,020
I just came to here to
play music for the dancers.

356
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,240
- Why would I follow you?
- Really?

357
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,380
It was always you who
followed me, Zhong Ja Gi.

358
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,680
Don't you remember?

359
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,890
I didn't know you played music here.

360
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:19,150
There is much that I cannot do.
I'm famous for the many things I can do.

361
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:22,940
I didn't know you were a gisaeng.

362
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,500
From the way you spoke,
I thought you were a high-class lady.

363
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,860
Whether you're a court musician
or a painter, just focus on your work.

364
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:32,070
It's a very bad habit to
gauge other people's status.

365
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,920
We should introduce ourselves since
we've seen each other three times.

366
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,630
What’s your name? Zhong Ja Gi?

367
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,360
- Bok Soon.
- Hey, Woo Hee!

368
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,390
We need to go back to our rooms now.

369
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,000
Oh, all right!

370
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,900
Bok Soon...

371
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,470
She sure is feisty.

372
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:54,140
Woo Hee. She said Woo Hee.

373
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,220
How are the plans to get the king

374
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,030
and the Crown Prince to
turn on So coming along?

375
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:04,600
We must get the king to believe that

376
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,270
the 4th Prince is a rival
to the Crown Prince.

377
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:11,910
Just pretend to
support the 4th Prince.

378
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:14,870
<i>[Park Young Gyu]</i>
Then I will do the rest, Your Majesty.

379
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:18,840
I gave the IOUs of the Crown Prince's uncle to the 4th Prince.

380
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,270
Once those documents are revealed,
Crown Prince will suspect the 4th Prince.

381
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:27,910
Yo is in Seokyeong meeting
with Wang Shik Ryeom.

382
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,560
Everything is perfect.

383
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,570
I should speed things up, as well.

384
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:34,630
Let's go.

385
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:39,360
Why is the Crown Prince
visiting his mother's family?

386
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,860
Oh, he has some issues to deal with.

387
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,220
Don't bring it up to him.

388
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,140
Yes, but So...

389
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:51,400
Is it true that you took
Soo out of the palace?

390
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,640
Soo is a court lady.

391
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,940
If you treat her like a regular girl,
both you and Soo will be in trouble.

392
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,750
You shouldn't make things hard for her.

393
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,540
I wasn't trying to
create problems for her.

394
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,440
I have no thoughts of
making things hard for her.

395
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:11,100
I merely made a mistake.

396
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,480
I don't know how to relate to people.

397
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:19,130
Must I be criticized
for things like that?

398
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:26,610
I did not know you
cared for Soo that deeply.

399
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:36,970
You and Soo are all I have
in this entire world.

400
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,850
Your Highness! Your Highness!

401
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,260
Cheondeokjeon Palace is
up in arms right now.

402
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:50,250
There are overwhelming requests for impeachment

403
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,600
of the Crown Prince and his maternal family
for imposing double taxation.

404
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:56,270
Many of the powerful families are asking
His Majesty to depose the Crown Prince.

405
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,540
<i>[Left Prime Minister Park Young Gyu]</i>
Did you not know about the embezzlement,
Crown Prince Moo?

406
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,560
Haven't you known of your maternal family's
unscrupulous dealings for quite some time?

407
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,790
I only found out later.

408
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,880
It was just a mistake
on my family's part.

409
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,800
Unlike your claims,

410
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:29,220
There was no plan to steal
from the hardworking citizens.

411
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,380
<i>[Park Sool Hee]</i>
Do not try to make false accusations.

412
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,830
He only found out later.

413
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:37,200
It was also wrong that you could
not control your family's corruption.

414
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,540
Your Majesty.

415
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:44,210
We would like to protest
leaving the future of this nation

416
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,620
to the immoral Crown Prince.

417
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,990
- Please consider this request.
- Please consider this request.

418
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,090
If so...

419
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:59,340
who would you prefer
over Crown Prince Moo?

420
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,340
Your... Your Majesty?

421
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,670
Are you saying you will
depose the Crown Prince?

422
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:13,800
There needs to be an alternative
in order for me to depose him.

423
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:18,030
So I am telling you to
recommend the prince

424
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:21,450
who would be best suited to lead Goryeo.

425
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:28,100
Your Majesty, I believe the
4th Prince would be best suited.

426
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,790
4th Prince? Do you mean Wang So?

427
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,670
Prince Wang So has
already been adopted out.

428
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:37,810
He will not have any maternal relatives
coming forward to claim him.

429
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,040
Also, he led the rain ritual.

430
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,890
Therefore, he won the confidence of the
royal family and the whole nation.

431
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:46,670
I think he is best suited
to be Crown Prince.

432
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,970
I apologize, Crown Prince.

433
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:12,160
I didn't think things would go so awry.

434
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,550
What do you mean?

435
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:16,990
I was only worried about you,
so I told So about it.

436
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:19,620
I thought he would be the one
who cared the most about you.

437
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:23,750
I only showed him the note
that your uncle wrote.

438
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:28,030
You're saying our 4th brother
knew about my maternal family?

439
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,150
I did tell him myself.

440
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,240
I'm sure he knew.

441
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:38,490
However, I did not know it would
put your position in danger.

442
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,570
Please put me death, Crown Prince.

443
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,010
It is time for you to return to Shinju.

444
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,220
You should go after the ninth day
of the ninth lunar month.

445
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,580
Do I have to?

446
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:15,290
There are those who wish
to make you Crown Prince.

447
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:19,120
Your mother, Queen Yoo, is behind it.

448
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:23,300
She is likely using you
to get to the throne.

449
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,570
I have no interactions with them,
so why must I go?

450
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,700
It is not fair.

451
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,300
A person's heart can be cunning.

452
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:34,250
You may not feel that way now,
but as you continue to feel wronged

453
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:37,210
you will forget the
sincerity you feel now.

454
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,010
<i>You were a shield for any arrows or
misfortune that would come his way.</i>

455
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:45,250
You had no idea that your father
had manipulated you.

456
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,130
To you, Your Majesty...

457
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:56,470
my true feelings must not matter at all.

458
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:59,280
I wanted to keep you with me
for a long time, as well.

459
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,170
However, what can I do?

460
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:05,650
You must cut the sprouts
before it grows any larger.

461
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,970
That is how the palace works.

462
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,930
It must be served by that girl.

463
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:51,470
Yes, Court Lady.

464
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,030
I have done as you ordered.

465
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:08,510
Queen Yoo must not know
what I have ordered you to do.

466
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,850
Yes, Your Highness.

467
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,040
I understand.

468
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,860
Was it not enough for you
to bother me as much as you have?

469
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,400
When will you leave me alone?

470
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,870
Didn't you say you wanted to be king?

471
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,120
I am a queen so I should help
my son's wishes come true.

472
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,610
Do not worry.

473
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:54,030
The throne will be yours if
everything goes according to plan.

474
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,570
Enough with these lies
claiming that this is for my sake.

475
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:01,770
I don't know what you're up to,
but it won't go according to your plan.

476
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:05,740
The Crown Prince will die on the
ninth day of the ninth lunar month.

477
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:09,140
I have already sent over a
tea cup that has poison on it.

478
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,340
Crown Prince Moo enjoys drinking tea.
You won't be able to stop it.

479
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,480
You think I won't do anything
with this information?

480
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,650
How are you going to say you
found out about the poison?

481
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,940
Will you say I told you?

482
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,990
If that's what I must do,
that's what I will do.

483
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,300
Is that so?

484
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:30,510
Then I will say I did it
to make you king.

485
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:33,020
In order to make you king...

486
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:37,840
I will say our entire family dug up the
corruption and poisoned Crown Prince Moo.

487
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:42,710
We've already made a covenant to
request you as the next Crown Prince.

488
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,160
This is how the palace is.

489
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,630
It only works if everyone's
eating up each other's tails.

490
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,080
Try to stop the poisoning if you can.

491
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,220
You will be tying a noose
around your own neck.

492
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:04,240
Things will not go your way.

493
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,930
The king has kicked you out.
Do you still not understand?

494
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,360
A measly court lady who serves tea will
die and Crown Prince Moo will be gone.

495
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,380
You will own everything.

496
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:29,270
How... would I be able to trust you?

497
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,960
You said so yourself.

498
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:35,660
Even if you became king,
you would not kill your brothers.

499
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,260
I trust you.

500
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,790
That's why I will support you.

501
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:58,280
Why is the Crown Prince's star fading?

502
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,910
I told you to wait just a little more.

503
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:09,450
Why did you insist on seeing me?

504
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:10,910
Hurry up and set a date for the coup.

505
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:15,690
I must rip open that big thief's (Wang Geon) guts.

506
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:18,190
This is the palace of the king of Goryeo.

507
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,320
It's not easy to find a vulnerable moment.

508
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,360
Don't even think about playing tricks on me.

509
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:25,430
If you don't help me kill the king,

510
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:29,530
I'll let all the remnants of Later Baekje know what you did before leaving it.

511
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,200
I doubt you'll live much longer after that.

512
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:40,040
When you were little, you were really cute, calling me uncle

513
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:46,350
No matter what I do to you, what can you do to me now?

514
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:49,450
I knew you wouldn't help me willingly.

515
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,730
How dare you treat a gisaeng like this?

516
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:02,630
Preserve your dignity!
Or I'll scream!

517
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:05,530
A court musician.

518
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:07,600
Insolent wench!

519
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:12,510
How dare you refuse my attention?
Begone!

520
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:27,620
But why was he here...?

521
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,260
Hey, are you OK?

522
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:36,130
If you're gonna be a coward and stay away,

523
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:37,270
at least be consistent about it.

524
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:39,700
Come on, it seemed like you could handle it all by yourself.

525
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,700
Looks like you have enough guts

526
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,770
to survive the Gyobang just as well.

527
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,810
This is yours, right?

528
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,350
I guess you don't want it back?

529
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:08,600
<i>Whatever you become
and if we meet again...</i>

530
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:12,720
<i>I will not forget the debt
that I owe you, Lady Hae.</i>

531
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:17,930
<i>I will keep the promise I made you.</i>

532
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,790
<i>I will love Hae Soo.</i>

533
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:25,530
<i>Please watch over us.</i>

534
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,580
Link arms and take a drink.

535
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,410
That is what you have rolled.

536
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:39,840
Go on, then.

537
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,280
Who will you choose?

538
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,920
His Majesty has not
been chosen even once.

539
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,000
I wonder if he will be able
to escape yet again.

540
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:53,490
All right, the person who will join me...

541
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,440
Jung, I would like to have
that drink with you.

542
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,800
I do not want to! I am a man.
Why would I do that with you?

543
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,250
If you say no...

544
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:21,060
it is bad luck.

545
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:26,510
Here.

546
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,970
Then we should start again?

547
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:51,530
First.

548
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:54,790
A round flower blooming
high in the tree

549
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:58,710
it is as if you've seen
the celestial poles.

550
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,940
Second.

551
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,650
Pure yellow, as yet untainted

552
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:08,840
is the colour of the earth.

553
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,640
Third.

554
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,990
To take root early and bloom late

555
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:19,100
is a great virtue.

556
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,230
Fourth.

557
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,640
A flower that blooms in the snow
symbolises integrity.

558
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:40,070
Fifth.

559
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:48,640
Fifth... Fifth...

560
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,200
Fifth.

561
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:58,330
A petal in a cup of wine,
is worthy of the gods.

562
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:01,490
It was written by Zhong Hui
about the chrysanthemum flower.

563
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:06,200
Good job, Won.

564
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,330
Jung, martial arts are good,
but focus on your studies too.

565
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

566
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:28,060
What's wrong?

567
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:30,760
You must not have much of
an appetite, Crown Prince.

568
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:36,860
The alcohol is not going down well today.
I am sorry to worry you.

569
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:39,380
Why don't we bring out some
chrysanthemum tea?

570
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:42,000
It is known to be good for your health.

571
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:45,820
Court Lady Oh, go on and
get him some chrysanthemum tea.

572
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,550
Yes, I will do so.

573
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:05,660
The Crown Prince would like
some chrysanthemum tea.

574
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:06,790
Hold on.

575
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:10,810
Soo, can you serve the tea instead of me?

576
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:13,640
I must be coming down with a cold.

577
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,730
I'm sorry.

578
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:18,450
Court Lady Oh told me to refrain
from serving the princes for now.

579
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:22,180
I guess there's nothing you can do.

580
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,300
Are you all right?

581
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,230
Hurry up!

582
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:42,670
We're late because it took you so long
to get ready and the king will be upset.

583
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,430
What is that expression about?

584
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:50,030
You don't think we're late
because I slept in, do you?

585
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,150
How shameless of you.

586
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,660
Greetings to you, Your Highness.

587
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,500
I said hurry up.

588
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:10,350
You need to receive her greeting.

589
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:14,210
- What?
- If you do not...

590
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:17,610
she has to continue standing like that.

591
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:26,150
Lift your head.

592
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:38,260
I don't want to see you at all.
Turn around now.

593
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:40,830
Yes.

594
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:44,470
From now on, turn around
whenever we see each other.

595
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:45,660
Do you understand?

596
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,010
I'm in a bad mood so I'm going back.

597
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,600
You can follow me or not.

598
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:07,430
If you're so hurt by it,
why didn't you become his second wife?

599
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:15,430
You like him enough to have
that kind of consideration for him.

600
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:17,930
Please watch over him.

601
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:21,410
Make sure he does not get into
useless fights within the palace.

602
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,310
He is easily swayed, so don't
let him get close to just anyone.

603
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:28,410
I am his wife now!
You no longer need to worry about that.

604
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,330
Test the tea for poison first.

605
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:21,660
I have something to say to you,
Crown Prince Moo.

606
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:30,090
Go on and speak.

607
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:35,400
Honestly...

608
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:57,870
<i>A measly court lady
who serves tea will die</i>

609
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:00,380
- <i>and Crown Prince Moo will be gone.</i>
- I have brought you chrysanthemum tea.

610
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:01,620
Thank you.

611
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:10,500
So, what were you saying?

612
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:13,540
Yes.

613
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:21,320
I have caused you trouble recently.

614
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:24,710
As your brother, I would like
three drinks from you

615
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:26,290
to strengthen our kinship.

616
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:30,410
Sounds good.

617
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:34,070
However, it is tea, not alcohol.
What will we do?

618
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:39,210
With the mood that I am in today,
I think even tea will get me drunk.

619
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,580
Give this to the 4th Prince.

620
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:44,780
Yes, Your Highness.

621
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,280
I have committed a deadly crime.

622
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,560
It was my fault.

623
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,590
I ate chrysanthemum biscuits earlier
so I had oil on my hands.

624
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,780
Bring a new cup.

625
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:55,610
First, I will drink to your longevity.

626
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:31,250
Second, you continue to fight for Goryeo

627
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:33,410
so I will drink to your fortune...

628
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:54,150
your fortune in war.

629
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:17,510
<i>It wasn't the cup.</i>

630
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:20,190
<i>You poisoned the tea?</i>

631
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:36,960
<i>I am...</i>

632
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:42,110
<i>drinking poison that you've poured me.</i>

633
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:00,220
Lastly...

634
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:06,450
no matter who tries to sow discord
between us with sly words

635
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:12,790
it is my wish that our
friendship will never change.

636
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:46,790
I am very thankful for your sincerity.

637
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:51,940
Your Majesty,
did you see my brother's heart?

638
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,400
How could I be apart
from a brother like this?

639
00:57:55,400 --> 00:58:00,250
Please withdraw your orders
to send him to Shinju.

640
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:13,270
The tea water has run low.
I will go get more.

641
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,230
I will step out for a moment.
