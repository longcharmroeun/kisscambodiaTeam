<i>[Final Episode]</i>

4
00:00:36,908 --> 00:00:40,048
I'll show you something nice
as your birthday present.

5
00:01:01,768 --> 00:01:04,448
The king has forbidden us
to have a wedding.

6
00:01:04,448 --> 00:01:07,198
I still prepared something in secret.

7
00:01:08,628 --> 00:01:09,708
Are you upset?

8
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,128
It is more than enough.

9
00:01:17,308 --> 00:01:18,628
Do not worry.

10
00:01:18,628 --> 00:01:20,758
I only wanted to get you
out of the palace.

11
00:01:20,758 --> 00:01:23,398
Even if we are married,
I am only going to consider us friends.

12
00:01:23,398 --> 00:01:25,328
I'm not worried about such things.

13
00:01:25,328 --> 00:01:29,018
It is far away from the noisy main house,
so it will be a quiet place to live.

14
00:01:29,018 --> 00:01:32,678
It is close to my primary residence,
so come by whenever you want.

15
00:01:35,018 --> 00:01:36,908
Oh, and this...

16
00:01:40,838 --> 00:01:44,178
Thank you for saying you wanted it.

17
00:02:14,118 --> 00:02:19,538
<i>[When the water has run dry,
Sit and watch for the rising clouds.]</i>

18
00:02:47,928 --> 00:02:49,308
Damn!

19
00:02:56,668 --> 00:02:59,248
Wow. Were you practicing
your sword skills again?

20
00:03:00,238 --> 00:03:02,478
I think you've practiced enough.

21
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:12,428
Here. Let's see how good
you are to your husband.

22
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:22,548
That's good. Let's go inside now.

23
00:03:22,548 --> 00:03:26,428
The court physician is retiring and
I asked him to come by on his way home.

24
00:03:26,428 --> 00:03:27,788
The doctor?

25
00:03:29,538 --> 00:03:30,908
I'm all right though.

26
00:03:30,908 --> 00:03:33,988
You suffered a lot,
so you should see a doctor.

27
00:03:33,988 --> 00:03:34,998
Let's go.

28
00:03:55,528 --> 00:04:00,908
Even when you left the palace,
I didn't feel the pulse of the baby.

29
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,758
- But now...
- It was still very early.

30
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,568
You would not have known.

31
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:09,788
Baby? Then are you saying...

32
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:13,828
Like I warned you before

33
00:04:13,828 --> 00:04:16,818
you have heart palpitations
and your health is not good.

34
00:04:16,818 --> 00:04:19,758
Because of your unborn baby,
you have become weaker.

35
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:23,268
If you insist on keeping the baby--

36
00:04:23,268 --> 00:04:24,518
I will be fine.

37
00:04:25,658 --> 00:04:29,228
As long as the baby is safe,
I do not care.

38
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:30,528
How can you say that?

39
00:04:32,388 --> 00:04:34,218
You must keep this a secret.

40
00:04:34,728 --> 00:04:38,208
Please delay going back home
and stay here for the time being.

41
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,438
Yes.

42
00:04:40,008 --> 00:04:43,318
My lady, you must never
be out in the cold wind.

43
00:04:43,318 --> 00:04:45,608
You should stay in bed if you can.

44
00:04:52,898 --> 00:04:55,928
Baek Ah said their marriage
was only a formality.

45
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,228
However...

46
00:04:58,748 --> 00:05:00,058
look at this.

47
00:05:00,648 --> 00:05:02,848
"The 14th Prince's wife watched him"

48
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:06,108
"practise his martial arts
for a long time."

49
00:05:06,108 --> 00:05:09,678
"They hold hands
and care for one another."

50
00:05:11,058 --> 00:05:14,988
Your Majesty, you know how Lady Soo is.

51
00:05:14,988 --> 00:05:18,168
She has been friendly with Jung
since she was young.

52
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:21,148
She has many bright aspects about her.

53
00:05:21,148 --> 00:05:24,628
She's the type of person who does not
care whether one is male or female.

54
00:05:45,448 --> 00:05:46,628
Soo!

55
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:48,528
Soo!

56
00:05:50,978 --> 00:05:54,728
Why did you come out here?
The cold wind can harm your baby...

57
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:56,188
Come on.

58
00:06:44,758 --> 00:06:48,008
I told you not to worry
and to sleep comfortably.

59
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:52,868
It's my first time sleeping in
the same room as my wife.

60
00:06:52,868 --> 00:06:54,578
Why do you keep telling me to leave?

61
00:06:56,078 --> 00:07:00,538
Now that I look at you,
I see that both you and I have aged.

62
00:07:01,448 --> 00:07:03,198
A lot of time has passed.

63
00:07:03,198 --> 00:07:06,408
If there are good times,
there are bad times, too.

64
00:07:08,098 --> 00:07:10,888
All of those days have passed, as well.

65
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:16,498
I have lived enough to learn that.

66
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:20,748
Do you remember when we first met?

67
00:07:23,198 --> 00:07:25,448
Was it in the 8th Prince's library?

68
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:32,238
Or was it when I saved you?

69
00:07:32,738 --> 00:07:35,998
You mean that time you came
running in with that stick?

70
00:07:38,018 --> 00:07:40,028
I was so shocked then.

71
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:43,018
I had never seen a girl so brave.

72
00:07:43,658 --> 00:07:45,838
What about when you fought Eun?

73
00:07:45,838 --> 00:07:48,318
I laughed whenever I thought about it.

74
00:07:48,988 --> 00:07:53,458
Your hair was a mess and
Eun had a big bruise on his head!

75
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:56,718
- You were still full of energy.
- I was.

76
00:07:56,718 --> 00:08:00,558
Why aren't you keeping your promise
to sing for me on my birthday?

77
00:08:00,558 --> 00:08:03,358
- I waited every year.
- Oh dear.

78
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,978
All right. I will sing for you this year.

79
00:08:08,138 --> 00:08:09,198
Do you remember?

80
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:12,838
You snuck into the Damiwon
and spied on us bathing.

81
00:08:12,838 --> 00:08:14,898
Why would you have done such a thing?

82
00:08:15,808 --> 00:08:19,068
If you think about it,
you've been sly since you were young.

83
00:08:19,068 --> 00:08:21,208
That's very unfair.

84
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,578
I was so shocked back then
that I didn't even see a thing.

85
00:08:23,578 --> 00:08:26,508
Do not lie! You saw everything, right?

86
00:08:26,508 --> 00:08:27,928
<i>I really couldn't see.</i>

87
00:08:31,318 --> 00:08:33,428
<i>What's wrong with my body?</i>

88
00:08:56,968 --> 00:09:01,998
From now on, I do not need to hear
updates about Jung and Hae Soo.

89
00:09:03,888 --> 00:09:07,168
Make sure I do not hear
anything about those two.

90
00:09:31,768 --> 00:09:33,731
<i>Finally, there's just the two of us now,</i>

91
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:36,834
<i>away from the palace.</i>

92
00:09:37,138 --> 00:09:38,908
<i>Just you and I...</i>

93
00:09:39,408 --> 00:09:41,658
<i>me and you.</i>

94
00:09:43,838 --> 00:09:45,943
<i>Now I can forget about truth and lies, </i>

95
00:09:46,108 --> 00:09:48,377
<i>misunderstandings and jealousy,</i>

96
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:53,117
<i>and the precarious fight for the throne and deaths</i>

97
00:09:53,478 --> 00:09:56,620
<i>and just devote my time</i>

98
00:09:56,988 --> 00:09:58,618
<i>on loving you.</i>

99
00:10:42,528 --> 00:10:46,878
<i>[Approximately six months later]</i>

100
00:11:01,008 --> 00:11:03,898
What about my wife?
Why was the baby born so early?

101
00:11:03,898 --> 00:11:06,588
Your daughter is still healthy.

102
00:11:07,428 --> 00:11:09,738
She is just so pretty.

103
00:11:10,788 --> 00:11:14,018
This child was stillborn.

104
00:11:14,718 --> 00:11:15,918
Do you understand?

105
00:11:16,548 --> 00:11:18,068
Take her to the wet nurse.

106
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:20,498
You must watch what you say.

107
00:11:45,158 --> 00:11:46,608
Don't worry about the baby.

108
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:49,718
She is so beautiful and healthy.
She sure is blessed.

109
00:11:49,718 --> 00:11:53,118
I got her the best wet nurse in the area.

110
00:11:53,118 --> 00:11:55,008
That's a relief.

111
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:05,298
So stop worrying about the baby
and worry about yourself.

112
00:12:06,038 --> 00:12:09,108
You need to get your health back
as soon as you can.

113
00:12:18,408 --> 00:12:20,298
I have a favor to ask.

114
00:12:25,648 --> 00:12:30,028
<i>[To: His Majesty]</i>

115
00:12:31,648 --> 00:12:34,718
Do you want to show the king your baby?

116
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:42,248
I...

117
00:12:44,248 --> 00:12:45,908
want to see him.

118
00:12:52,258 --> 00:12:53,618
All right.

119
00:12:59,918 --> 00:13:02,518
Send this to the king.
Tell him to read it as soon as possible.

120
00:13:02,518 --> 00:13:03,848
Yes.

121
00:13:04,908 --> 00:13:06,068
Wait!

122
00:13:12,108 --> 00:13:14,748
To think, my wife's calligraphy
is identical to the king's.

123
00:13:15,048 --> 00:13:16,618
It will look strange.

124
00:13:33,404 --> 00:13:35,404
<i>[To: His Majesty
From: Wang Jung]</i>

125
00:14:26,718 --> 00:14:28,826
We have to differentiate the distribution of rice to the clans.

126
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,562
If they have less,

127
00:14:31,562 --> 00:14:33,230
they'll have less standing.

128
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,099
All that the clans have can be reduced to

129
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:37,398
land and slaves.

130
00:14:37,468 --> 00:14:41,898
Your Majesty, the 14th Prince
has sent you a letter.

131
00:14:55,918 --> 00:14:58,128
He isn't getting tired
of sending the letters.

132
00:15:03,368 --> 00:15:05,238
Aren't you even going to read it?

133
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,608
I'm sure it's full of
resentment towards me.

134
00:15:08,318 --> 00:15:10,278
I don't want to read it and feel bad.

135
00:15:11,318 --> 00:15:13,898
He said he had a message for you,
Your Majesty.

136
00:15:13,898 --> 00:15:15,708
He even sent someone.

137
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,188
Do I look like I have the time
to meet someone like that?

138
00:15:19,248 --> 00:15:20,568
Forgive me.

139
00:15:39,218 --> 00:15:41,598
Is he not here yet?

140
00:15:47,848 --> 00:15:50,348
I have sent so many.

141
00:15:53,918 --> 00:15:56,288
Does he hate me that much?

142
00:16:01,918 --> 00:16:03,918
Please send someone there.

143
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:09,418
If you send him my message,
he will come.

144
00:16:10,258 --> 00:16:11,668
I did, but...

145
00:16:14,118 --> 00:16:17,508
Yes, I forgot. I will send someone.

146
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:25,128
Let's go outside.
You need to feel happy to get better.

147
00:16:25,128 --> 00:16:28,588
I brought over the most
famous musicians from Songak.

148
00:16:29,028 --> 00:16:31,308
I brought peony flowers, too.

149
00:16:32,248 --> 00:16:33,398
Don't you want to see them?

150
00:16:36,018 --> 00:16:38,238
- Peonies?
- Yes.

151
00:16:46,888 --> 00:16:48,948
Is there a song you want to hear,
in particular?

152
00:16:54,908 --> 00:16:56,778
Play a song you're best at.

153
00:16:56,778 --> 00:16:58,858
There was a court lady the king loved.

154
00:16:58,858 --> 00:17:03,258
This is the song they say
made him fall in love with her.

155
00:17:04,008 --> 00:17:05,138
The king?

156
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:11,408
I would like to hear it.

157
00:17:37,368 --> 00:17:42,188
<i>The days that pass by painfully.</i>

158
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:47,458
<i>In the stillness of the day and wind.</i>

159
00:17:48,218 --> 00:17:54,758
<i>Because I like the sunshine, I smile.</i>

160
00:17:55,568 --> 00:18:00,388
<i>Passing by so busily.</i>

161
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:05,628
<i>Even among those heartless people.</i>

162
00:18:06,598 --> 00:18:13,478
<i>Because I like my friend, I smile.</i>

163
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:21,528
<i>If I find a place without loneliness...</i>

164
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:27,828
<i>come with me to that place.</i>

165
00:18:28,718 --> 00:18:34,278
<i>Let us go together, friend...</i>

166
00:18:34,498 --> 00:18:36,104
<i>Friend...</i>

167
00:18:38,308 --> 00:18:40,758
<i>Thank you for being the way you are.</i>

168
00:18:40,758 --> 00:18:42,978
<i>I love you.</i>

169
00:18:56,888 --> 00:18:58,778
Long ago...

170
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:05,358
you promised that you would
treat my life as if it were your life.

171
00:19:07,838 --> 00:19:10,028
Do you remember that?

172
00:19:17,828 --> 00:19:19,248
My daughter...

173
00:19:22,058 --> 00:19:23,488
in my place...

174
00:19:26,228 --> 00:19:28,248
I need you to protect her.

175
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:34,008
You cannot let her go to the palace.

176
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:39,318
Why would you say such things?

177
00:19:44,638 --> 00:19:46,878
He will not be coming.

178
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:07,818
Soo.

179
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:11,708
In your next life...

180
00:20:14,228 --> 00:20:15,818
you'll remember me, won't you?

181
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:20,538
I'm going to forget you.

182
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,308
I will forget everything.

183
00:20:30,138 --> 00:20:32,338
Even in my dreams...

184
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:37,578
all of you.

185
00:21:43,308 --> 00:21:44,388
Soo...

186
00:21:46,608 --> 00:21:48,828
would not hate me this much.

187
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,668
Apparently, she had been
sending you letters, Your Majesty.

188
00:21:55,868 --> 00:21:57,538
Haven't you read them?

189
00:22:39,978 --> 00:22:42,308
<i>Life is like a dream.</i>

190
00:22:42,888 --> 00:22:46,278
<i>Right and wrong. Love and hate.</i>

191
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:50,638
<i>They all get buried with the passing of
time and leave quietly with no trace.</i>

192
00:22:51,768 --> 00:22:55,031
<i>Do you still think that you don't have my whole heart</i>

193
00:22:55,031 --> 00:22:57,334
<i>and resent me?</i>

194
00:22:57,898 --> 00:23:01,298
<i>I'm always worried that</i>

195
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:04,408
<i>I may have left you with hatred instead of love,</i>

196
00:23:04,808 --> 00:23:08,505
<i> not allowing you to rest in peace.</i>

197
00:23:22,358 --> 00:23:24,959
<i>I still love you.</i>

198
00:23:25,188 --> 00:23:28,418
<i>When you gave up everything
and stood by me in the rain...</i>

199
00:23:29,118 --> 00:23:33,678
<i>When you threw your body in the way
of a flying arrow to protect me...</i>

200
00:23:33,928 --> 00:23:36,678
<i>you became someone I could never forget in my life. </i>

201
00:23:38,938 --> 00:23:41,044
<i> I came to realize that the opposite of loving</i>

202
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,988
<i> is not hating,</i>

203
00:23:43,988 --> 00:23:46,218
<i>but leaving.</i>

204
00:23:47,918 --> 00:23:49,419
<i>I'm afraid you may think</i>

205
00:23:49,778 --> 00:23:51,688
 that I left you

206
00:23:52,108 --> 00:23:57,294
<i> and that you left me.</i>

207
00:23:58,261 --> 00:24:00,964
<i>I yearn for you so much,</i>

208
00:24:00,964 --> 00:24:00,997
<i>but I can't be near you.</i>
<i>I yearn for you so much,</i>

209
00:24:00,997 --> 00:24:03,900
<i>but I can't be near you.</i>

210
00:24:04,628 --> 00:24:08,605
<i>I hope and wait to see you again inside these fences,</i>

211
00:24:08,605 --> 00:24:13,643
<i>I'll be waiting for you... every day.</i>

212
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,078
Soo!

213
00:25:05,328 --> 00:25:08,038
Where is Soo? Where is she?

214
00:25:09,418 --> 00:25:10,668
Soo...

215
00:25:12,108 --> 00:25:14,988
Stop playing around and come out. Soo...

216
00:25:14,988 --> 00:25:17,878
Soo! Where are you?

217
00:25:17,878 --> 00:25:19,948
Where are you!

218
00:25:19,948 --> 00:25:22,048
Soo, Soo!

219
00:25:27,968 --> 00:25:30,458
What have you been doing
this entire time?

220
00:25:31,138 --> 00:25:33,778
Don't pretend to be sad now.

221
00:25:40,488 --> 00:25:42,258
It is all your fault.

222
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:45,028
Your name was written on the envelopes.

223
00:25:46,058 --> 00:25:49,028
I didn't know Soo's letters were inside.

224
00:25:49,888 --> 00:25:53,548
I did that because your handwriting
was so similar to hers.

225
00:25:54,318 --> 00:25:57,188
Still, you must have known Soo was dying.

226
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:00,158
I know you had someone
keeping an eye on this house.

227
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:04,568
You were sharing a room with Soo
and getting along so well.

228
00:26:04,568 --> 00:26:07,458
He stopped getting
any reports on you two.

229
00:26:38,378 --> 00:26:41,608
Soo... let's go.

230
00:26:43,078 --> 00:26:44,208
Let's go.

231
00:26:47,258 --> 00:26:50,598
No. You can't. She's my wife!

232
00:26:51,138 --> 00:26:52,418
Move.

233
00:26:53,418 --> 00:26:57,478
Soo may be dead, but she's my person.

234
00:26:58,428 --> 00:27:02,538
Jung, you ought to know!
You should know better than anyone.

235
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,068
You know who Soo would want to be with.

236
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:26,938
If you truly consider Soo a friend,
do not fight with the king any longer.

237
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:32,938
Hae Soo spent her life
caught between all of us.

238
00:27:32,938 --> 00:27:35,038
She couldn't do this or that.

239
00:27:37,488 --> 00:27:42,218
Knowing that, are you going to
make Hae Soo even sadder?

240
00:28:00,368 --> 00:28:01,688
You didn't actually...

241
00:28:04,408 --> 00:28:05,648
Soo.

242
00:28:09,318 --> 00:28:10,878
How foolish of you.

243
00:28:41,578 --> 00:28:44,058
<i>I'm not alone, so I'll be fine.</i>

244
00:28:48,098 --> 00:28:50,698
<i>You're here, Your Highness,
so why am I alone?</i>

245
00:28:58,868 --> 00:29:00,978
<i>I won't leave.</i>

246
00:29:20,568 --> 00:29:24,053
<i>I... won't leave.</i>

247
00:29:39,938 --> 00:29:41,198
Let me go!

248
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:46,498
I am someone who could have been king.

249
00:29:46,498 --> 00:29:49,298
If you're going to kill me,
hang me in front of the Cheondeokjeon!

250
00:29:55,848 --> 00:29:59,378
Are you telling me to kill myself?

251
00:30:07,778 --> 00:30:08,808
What?

252
00:30:09,738 --> 00:30:13,588
Did the king send you to
confirm whether I die or not?

253
00:30:13,588 --> 00:30:15,948
I'm here to deliver something to you.

254
00:30:17,618 --> 00:30:19,148
Hae Soo requested it.

255
00:30:26,248 --> 00:30:27,928
She died a long time ago.

256
00:30:27,928 --> 00:30:32,938
She asked in her will that I
deliver Chae Ryung's letter to you.

257
00:30:34,808 --> 00:30:36,928
I can't do anything more for you.

258
00:30:38,228 --> 00:30:39,478
I'm sorry.

259
00:31:07,068 --> 00:31:10,538
<i>I know the end is coming soon.</i>

260
00:31:10,538 --> 00:31:14,108
<i>Can I use this chance</i>

261
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:17,478
<i>and go to you, Your Highness?</i>

262
00:31:18,828 --> 00:31:21,748
<i>I don't know when I'll be
allowed to leave the palace again.</i>

263
00:31:21,748 --> 00:31:26,438
<i>I am just a person who couldn't
stop loving once I started.</i>

264
00:31:26,438 --> 00:31:28,688
<i>I'm a foolish person like that.</i>

265
00:31:32,448 --> 00:31:35,184
<i>Chae Ryung doesn't regret it.</i>

266
00:31:35,448 --> 00:31:37,151
<i>I don't resent anyone.</i>

267
00:31:39,578 --> 00:31:43,198
<i>Whether there is value
in doing something or not...</i>

268
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,398
<i>that is something only you
can answer for yourself.</i>

269
00:31:59,748 --> 00:32:01,248
Stupid girl.

270
00:32:03,348 --> 00:32:05,578
Why don't you hate me?

271
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,885
Why?

272
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:16,125
[Great Prince Hyo Eun Wang Won, executed for treason]

273
00:32:39,348 --> 00:32:41,248
My father will catch you.

274
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:52,368
You're Wook's daughter, aren't you?

275
00:32:54,358 --> 00:32:57,348
I'm your uncle. Your 13th uncle.

276
00:32:57,348 --> 00:33:00,568
Liar. You look like a wandering musician.

277
00:33:01,748 --> 00:33:03,238
I'm telling the truth.

278
00:33:04,028 --> 00:33:05,288
What's your name?

279
00:33:05,288 --> 00:33:07,508
My name? It's Bok Soon.

280
00:33:09,148 --> 00:33:11,568
<i>What's your name? Zhong Ja Gi?</i>

281
00:33:11,568 --> 00:33:13,288
<i>- Bok Soon.
- Woo Hee!</i>

282
00:33:13,288 --> 00:33:15,398
<i>We have to go to our dorms now.</i>

283
00:33:15,398 --> 00:33:16,958
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

284
00:33:20,618 --> 00:33:22,758
Bok... Soon?

285
00:33:38,648 --> 00:33:40,008
Is that a zhen mu shou talisman?

286
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,618
Where did you get it?

287
00:33:43,618 --> 00:33:46,548
I don't know. I've always had it.

288
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:50,318
It's my favorite thing.

289
00:34:14,008 --> 00:34:19,198
<i>Right in this moment,
I wish I wasn't a daughter of Baekje.</i>

290
00:34:20,928 --> 00:34:22,168
<i>With all my heart...</i>

291
00:34:25,108 --> 00:34:26,658
<i>I am your companion.</i>

292
00:34:57,898 --> 00:35:02,748
I heard you still have no plans to marry
and you spend your time in the fields.

293
00:35:06,038 --> 00:35:10,308
If there were no excitement,
how weary would life be?

294
00:35:19,528 --> 00:35:22,718
The king has spent his time reading

295
00:35:22,718 --> 00:35:24,878
the "Essentials of Government
in the Zhenguan Reign."

296
00:35:24,878 --> 00:35:26,868
He is wielding his sword now.

297
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:33,028
He is freeing the slaves and
restoring them to their former status.

298
00:35:34,658 --> 00:35:37,458
It is taking power away from
the noble class families.

299
00:35:38,238 --> 00:35:41,868
You still have great interest
in the palace, as always.

300
00:35:42,828 --> 00:35:44,678
I am only observing.

301
00:35:47,048 --> 00:35:48,238
It is So.

302
00:35:49,348 --> 00:35:52,368
I am curious to see what
kind of king he will become.

303
00:35:55,558 --> 00:35:56,728
I wonder...

304
00:35:58,278 --> 00:36:02,168
perhaps, Goryeo has the most
powerful king in its history.

305
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:07,568
He has had to give up that much, as well.

306
00:36:22,368 --> 00:36:23,468
Lately...

307
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:27,668
there are faces I can't
stop thinking about.

308
00:36:27,668 --> 00:36:31,648
Do you still miss Hae Soo?

309
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:41,068
I don't know.

310
00:36:51,278 --> 00:36:56,318
I was always... giving my heart.

311
00:36:57,868 --> 00:37:00,438
But I was always making mistakes.

312
00:37:04,898 --> 00:37:06,808
I only realized that now.

313
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:47,668
It is his birthday.

314
00:37:47,668 --> 00:37:50,828
How can you not go to Ju even once?

315
00:37:51,548 --> 00:37:54,708
It is more than enough
for you to go to him.

316
00:37:54,708 --> 00:37:56,648
He fears his own father.

317
00:37:56,648 --> 00:38:01,668
You treat him like he is
your competition, Your Majesty.

318
00:38:01,668 --> 00:38:06,498
You've already gotten rid of your nephews
Gyeongchunwon and Heunghwagoong.

319
00:38:07,188 --> 00:38:09,498
You should at least trust your son.

320
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:12,858
Look here, Queen.

321
00:38:14,248 --> 00:38:18,248
I know very well about people who hide
their true selves behind invisible masks.

322
00:38:18,858 --> 00:38:21,218
Both you and that child...

323
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:24,938
I know very well that you will
come after me someday.

324
00:38:27,578 --> 00:38:32,878
So... you still only remember her?

325
00:38:40,378 --> 00:38:43,798
Hae Soo was the only one who
spoke of all people being equal.

326
00:38:44,828 --> 00:38:48,268
You are emancipating those taken into
slavery because you can't forget her.

327
00:38:48,268 --> 00:38:50,378
Did you think I wouldn't know?

328
00:38:50,378 --> 00:38:52,178
Suppose I am.

329
00:38:52,178 --> 00:38:56,368
However, even if you do know

330
00:38:56,368 --> 00:38:58,498
will anything change?

331
00:39:05,368 --> 00:39:09,888
Now that I think about it,
I think I understand why Hae Soo left.

332
00:39:11,128 --> 00:39:12,968
I think I know why.

333
00:39:37,268 --> 00:39:38,508
Dad!

334
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:40,998
You'll hurt yourself.

335
00:39:43,188 --> 00:39:45,548
Ow! Ouch!

336
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:52,568
<i>Ow! Ouch!</i>

337
00:39:53,698 --> 00:39:55,438
You bumped into me.

338
00:40:03,888 --> 00:40:05,128
Who are you?

339
00:40:10,558 --> 00:40:12,088
Dad!

340
00:40:18,698 --> 00:40:20,238
Hello, Your Majesty.

341
00:40:27,908 --> 00:40:32,608
You are not supposed to leave Chungju,
yet you come to the palace?

342
00:40:32,608 --> 00:40:34,408
It's the anniversary of Soo's death.

343
00:40:34,408 --> 00:40:35,878
Forgive me.

344
00:40:35,878 --> 00:40:39,228
I lost my mind for a moment.
This won't happen again.

345
00:40:40,558 --> 00:40:41,908
Is she your child?

346
00:40:45,108 --> 00:40:46,118
Yes.

347
00:40:49,308 --> 00:40:52,768
Your family asked permission for you
to marry and I recall consenting to it.

348
00:40:53,578 --> 00:40:54,638
However...

349
00:40:58,778 --> 00:41:00,418
your child is very grown.

350
00:41:03,098 --> 00:41:04,388
How old is she?

351
00:41:04,388 --> 00:41:06,388
I'm sure you're busy
managing the country.

352
00:41:06,388 --> 00:41:08,798
Why bother with my child?

353
00:41:09,308 --> 00:41:10,628
Come along.

354
00:41:13,588 --> 00:41:14,818
Stop.

355
00:41:32,278 --> 00:41:34,068
Leave the child.

356
00:41:44,678 --> 00:41:47,178
I cannot do so unless you kill me.

357
00:41:49,518 --> 00:41:50,578
Really?

358
00:41:52,068 --> 00:41:53,198
For this child...

359
00:41:56,188 --> 00:41:58,748
she asked that she does
not live in the palace.

360
00:42:00,178 --> 00:42:01,958
It is so scary and lonely.

361
00:42:02,718 --> 00:42:04,718
She said she did not want her here.

362
00:42:09,488 --> 00:42:13,978
That is all Hae Soo worried about
until the moment she died.

363
00:42:47,548 --> 00:42:49,478
14th Prince, Wang Jung.

364
00:42:53,198 --> 00:42:55,248
I release you from your exile
to your hometown.

365
00:43:04,468 --> 00:43:06,778
I'd like it if you came to
the palace every now and then.

366
00:43:53,508 --> 00:43:56,208
Do you want to leave that badly?

367
00:43:56,868 --> 00:43:57,888
Yes.

368
00:43:59,028 --> 00:44:00,798
I can't help but think of him.

369
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,778
You promised me otherwise.

370
00:44:06,698 --> 00:44:10,698
You said you were not anyone's person,
but the king's person.

371
00:44:11,888 --> 00:44:12,928
Yes.

372
00:44:14,198 --> 00:44:16,838
However, I think my king was one person.

373
00:44:18,508 --> 00:44:21,998
He was a brother and a friend to me.

374
00:44:23,528 --> 00:44:24,878
He was a monarch.

375
00:44:30,928 --> 00:44:35,058
In regards to Lady Hae Soo,
I don't think she was from this world.

376
00:44:36,068 --> 00:44:39,318
When you think back on things,
there are many instances you realize it.

377
00:44:39,318 --> 00:44:41,308
You need to forget her.

378
00:44:41,308 --> 00:44:45,888
If you long for a person you
cannot reach, you'll end up like me.

379
00:46:19,758 --> 00:46:22,618
Then, should I call you my person?

380
00:46:25,608 --> 00:46:28,198
<i>You are my only queen.</i>

381
00:47:08,858 --> 00:47:10,788
Why am I like this again?

382
00:47:12,748 --> 00:47:15,148
Seriously, who is he that I'm like this?

383
00:47:28,337 --> 00:47:30,078
<i>[Goryeo Era Makeup Culture]</i>

384
00:47:30,478 --> 00:47:33,978
Goryeo was influenced by Buddhism
to wash the eyes and take baths.

385
00:47:33,978 --> 00:47:38,498
Also, it was an era when bath products
and makeup started to develop.

386
00:47:38,498 --> 00:47:42,028
Song Dynasty writer So Kung traveled
to Goryeo and wrote in his book...

387
00:47:43,388 --> 00:47:46,408
I've been having the same dream
for almost one year.

388
00:47:46,408 --> 00:47:49,778
He's a man with a long scar
on his face like this.

389
00:47:49,778 --> 00:47:51,448
He hides it with a mask like this.

390
00:47:52,368 --> 00:47:54,188
He was dressed in olden day clothes, too.

391
00:47:54,188 --> 00:47:56,478
It's because you came back from death.

392
00:47:56,478 --> 00:47:59,398
You nearly drowned, passed out,
then woke up after a year.

393
00:47:59,398 --> 00:48:01,868
I'm totally fine now.

394
00:48:06,188 --> 00:48:08,798
I don't know why
when I dream about him...

395
00:48:10,268 --> 00:48:12,688
I end up crying so much.

396
00:48:18,498 --> 00:48:21,818
They had a powder treatment that
was similar to the modern facial pack.

397
00:48:22,388 --> 00:48:25,068
They could go to the Byukrando market
to get things from Bulgaria.

398
00:48:25,898 --> 00:48:29,638
They would get roses from Bulgaria.

399
00:48:29,638 --> 00:48:33,818
It is amazing that they were
able to create makeup from roses.

400
00:48:48,448 --> 00:48:50,088

00:49:04,228 --> 00:49:06,928
Yes. I'm Go Ha Jin.

404
00:49:07,398 --> 00:49:11,038
Did you know that the last name Go
was Hae in the Goryeo era?

405
00:49:11,038 --> 00:49:13,308
Oh, really?

406
00:49:13,308 --> 00:49:16,468
We happen to be selling makeup
from the Goryeo era.

407
00:49:16,468 --> 00:49:18,188
That's a fun coincidence.

408
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:20,198
There is no such thing as a coincidence.

409
00:49:20,198 --> 00:49:22,848
Things only return
to their original place.

410
00:49:23,658 --> 00:49:24,708
What?

411
00:49:27,308 --> 00:49:30,098
It smells a lot like roses here.

412
00:49:30,098 --> 00:49:34,268
Ah, that's because our products
have a lot of rose oil in them.

413
00:49:34,268 --> 00:49:35,608
Especially this serum here.

414
00:49:36,488 --> 00:49:39,478
It's made with Bulgarian rose oil
in houttuynia cordata extract.

415
00:49:39,528 --> 00:49:42,488
<i>Bulgarian rose oil.
You didn't use that, did you?</i>

416
00:49:51,198 --> 00:49:53,768
- Are you all right?
- Huh?

417
00:49:55,188 --> 00:49:56,948
It's nothing.

418
00:49:58,918 --> 00:50:03,398
It's good for your skin
if you use this regularly.

419
00:50:05,078 --> 00:50:09,298
Oh, did you know they had something
like BB cream during the Goryeo era?

420
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:11,138
Men use it a lot these days.

What's wrong with me?

425
00:50:28,428 --> 00:50:31,128
You shouldn't be here.
Don't worry about it and go home.

426
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:32,288
I'll take care of it.

The late King Taejo's last words

It is all short and in vain.

But I think that he was wrong.

You and I are together like this,
so how could it be in vain?

461

I feel nervous whenever
you have that facial expression.

462
00:56:51,168 --> 00:56:53,318
I feel like you're going to
leave me and go far away.

What are you hiding?

It's just...

Every step that I take...

467
00:57:12,698 --> 00:57:15,438
I feel I must be cautious,
like I'm walking on thin ice.

468
00:57:17,598 --> 00:57:19,558
Sometimes, I feel like I cannot breathe.

Even though you have me?
