4
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,370
Wait!

5
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,900
Wait. Hold on, there.

6
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,340
How can you throw someone around
as if they're a bag or something?

7
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,590
I told you to hold on and wait!

8
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,850
How can you go so fast
on such a narrow road?

9
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,660
Look over there! Look, look.
Everyone had to move to the side.

10
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,020
People come before cars...
before horses.

11
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,620
Is your horse more important?

12
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,870
Oh my!

13
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,370
Hey! Hey, you!

14
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,800
Wow! What is with him?

15
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,770
Lady, please forget about him.

16
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,610
Cops! I mean, the police.

17
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,850
Where are they?

18
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,230
They need to arrest that man.

19
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,590
What do you mean?
Do you really not know the 4th Prince?

20
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,330
You're lucky just to be alive.

21
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,430
4th Prince?

22
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,190
Another prince?

23
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,940
How many sons does Taejo have?

24
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,150
Lady!

25
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,050
Lady, Lady!

26
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,600
What are you doing here?

27
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,180
Chae Ryung, who is the man
who's about this tall?

28
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,860
And he has big eyes.

29
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,140
He came out of our house.

30
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,870
Do you know any of the visitors
who look like that?

31
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,690
It is not the time to be out here.

32
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,890
Princess Yeon Hwa has been
looking all over the place for you.

33
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,310
Princess Yeon Hwa?

34
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,270
It seems like our fourth brother
is not going to come.

35
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:48,020
Sister, seeing So is so scary
that it gives me a headache.

36
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,770
I accidentally stepped on his foot
two days ago...

37
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,940
"Do you want to die?"
I was so scared.

38
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,410
You are so bad.

39
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,120
We may have the same mother

40
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,730
but we've never had
a proper conversation.

41
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,860
Even if I say hello to him,
he doesn't respond to me.

42
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,890
He does have a tendency to ruin the mood.

43
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,820
Brother, you've arrived.

44
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,710
You're late.

45
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,660
You and I should practice for
the ritual together on our own.

46
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,940
We can do that.

47
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,380
We had not heard from you at all

48
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,790
so we were going to
send someone to Shinju.

49
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,620
Why haven't we heard from you?

50
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,480
I'm here, aren't I?

51
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,060
You should stay here with us
while you're in Songak.

52
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,280
I would like to hear about Shinju.

53
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,940
Yes, it would be better here
than in the queen's home.

54
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,770
Wook, don't try so hard.

55
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:25,950
He understands animals better than
he understands the words of people.

56
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,500
Ah, no wonder...

57
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,170
I thought your words were very clear.

58
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,920
<i>Princess, we've prepared the drinks.</i>

59
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,220
What are you doing?
Bring them in now.

60
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,970
Have you seen me before, by chance?

61
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,220
No, I haven't.

62
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,430
- You look familiar.
- No.

63
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,270
You're the one who spied on us bathing.

64
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,960
- That's impossible.
- It is you.

65
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,400
It wasn't me!

66
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,390
What's going on?

67
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,760
Is it really that girl?

68
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,860
She seems overly taken aback,
so I think it is.

69
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,040
That girl has changed.

70
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,910
She was a very careful,
well-behaved girl.

71
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,990
Right, Wook?

72
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,430
I can't really say.
I wasn't that close to her.

73
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,770
I don't know.

74
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,760
Eun, you saw wrong.

75
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,270
How could she have been in that
bathing area? It's only for royalty.

76
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,550
I'm good at recognizing people though.

77
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,050
I'm quite sure of it.

78
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,000
Gosh, that little guy.

79
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,060
He should just accept it if I said no.

80
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,310
I'm going to go crazy, seriously.

81
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,800
Let's just hold it all in.

82
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,970
If you can get through today,
you probably won't see him again.

83
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,810
What is he doing here?

84
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,120
Where did she run off to?

85
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,780
That way or this way?

86
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,620
Stop.

87
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,680
Who is it?

88
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:16,060
I was right. You were spying.

89
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,250
Are you suspecting me? I'm a prince.

90
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,320
Do you actually think I'd spy
on a servant wench like her?

91
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,230
Yes, I do.

92
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,700
Are you certain that it was me?

93
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,140
Answer me.

94
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,330
Are you certain that you saw me?

95
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,490
Well, it's...

96
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,540
I did not get a good look.

97
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,380
Do you see?

98
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,840
You must not doubt a prince again.

99
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,800
Chae Ryung may not have seen you,
but I saw it very clearly.

100
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,980
I understand that you are
curious about women.

101
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,330
Still, it isn't right to spy on them!

102
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,270
Apologize to her now.

103
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,930
Apologize?

104
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,810
Are you telling me, a prince,
to lower myself in front of a servant?

105
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,880
There is no such law in this nation.

106
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,070
Now, move.

107
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,340
Hey, now! Are you not ashamed?

108
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,200
You shameless person.

109
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,810
You dare speak that way to a prince?

110
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,640
What? How insolent you are!

111
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,820
Move!

112
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,940
Apologize! Hurry up and apologize!

113
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,390
Seriously, you're the size
of a rice grain.

114
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,810
- Really? Hey!
- What?

115
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,510
Hey, let go of me. Let go.

116
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,980
- Let go. I'm serious.
- You let go.

117
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,240
Hey!

118
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:01,280
<i>Let me go! Let go! Ouch!</i>

119
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,920
Oh! I think there's a fight going on.

120
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,890
Gosh, it's Eun.

121
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,690
<i>I said, let go!</i>

122
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,840
They are so immature.

123
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,590
<i>- Let go, let go.
- No, you let go.</i>

124
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,120
Yeah, fights are very entertaining.

125
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,690
<i>Let me go. Let me go.</i>

126
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,400
You! How do you like this?

127
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,240
- You...
- What!

128
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,410
Hey! You...

129
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,790
You think you'll be safe after this?

130
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,200
You molester! You pervert!

131
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,490
You lewd wench.

132
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,400
You still have something to say.

133
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,710
People like you need to have
some sense beaten into you.

134
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,380
Let go of me!

135
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,930
So, hold on to her nice and tight.

136
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,480
- You awful wench.
- Eun.

137
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,050
Wook!

138
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:36,320
The servants are staring.
Are you going to keep this up?

139
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,410
Hey, don't laugh.

140
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,730
Hey... wait up.

141
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,920
Hey, wait!

142
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,960
You did this earlier too.

143
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,180
Do I look like a parcel or a bag to you?

144
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,820
You should apologize too.

145
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,000
Who are you?

146
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,500
Me? Who am I?

147
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,000
Hae Soo. I am Hae Soo.

148
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,620
I'm not asking you for your name.

149
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,160
What is your position that
you'd act that way to a prince?

150
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,540
I told you to apologize.

151
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,870
Why are you asking my rank
like I'm in the military?

152
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,730
Are you going to ignore me if I'm a
servant and apologize if I'm a princess?

153
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,200
Gosh, this is a funny neighborhood.

154
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,660
So, you want to hear an apology?

155
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,100
Yes, and not just from you,
but from that small, little prince.

156
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,520
I will get an apology from him too.

157
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,910
The higher up you are,
the more you should care about justice.

158
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,950
Don't you agree?

159
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,670
All right.

160
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,980
However...

161
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,340
once you hear "sorry" from me...

162
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,810
you will have to die.

163
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,270
That's okay though, right?

164
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,120
Then...

165
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,670
- I am sor--
- Lady Hae!

166
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,150
You came looking for me, right?

167
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,170
Let's go, let's go.
Let's get going and talk.

168
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,530
Let's get going. Let's go.

169
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,910
Hae Soo...

170
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,900
Whatever the reason was

171
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,920
you hit the son of
the king of our nation.

172
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,150
You will not be able to avoid punishment.

173
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:17,140
Perhaps...

174
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,900
my prince will be punished as well.

175
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,830
Do you think you can help me?

176
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:30,120
I will do my best to explain to the king.

177
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,140
Do you think it's easy to meet the king?

178
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:39,370
I don't know how
you have changed so much.

179
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,240
You were such a well-behaved girl.

180
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:52,670
The mothers of Songak come here to pray
for the well-being of their children.

181
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:58,240
Have you thought about why I come here

182
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,610
even though I have no children?

183
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,280
This is what Queen Hwangbo has made

184
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,140
on behalf of the prince
and Princess Yeon Hwa.

185
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,030
And this...

186
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,610
I am building it for you.

187
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,660
For me?

188
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:30,620
When you first came to this house...

189
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,620
When I knew you would grow up alone...

190
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,990
you had no mother, so I never
considered you as a younger cousin.

191
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,420
I thought of you as my own child.

192
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:52,180
Your mother would have done this
for you if she were here.

193
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,970
I wanted to do the same thing for you.

194
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:01,730
However, on a day like today,
I wonder if my efforts were not enough.

195
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,560
Your mother must be watching us,
and I wonder what I should do.

196
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,190
I feel ashamed.

197
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,880
Mom.

198
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,240
My mom.

199
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,730
Soo.

200
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,190
Please.

201
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,600
What am I to do with you?

202
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,500
Think of your mother.

203
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,530
And try to live well here.

204
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,170
Mom, Mom.

205
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,440
Yes, I know.

206
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:32,100
<i>Go Ha Jin, you're a burden
wherever you go.</i>

207
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,340
<i>Everyone is being good to you,
but you're a nuisance.</i>

208
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,170
<i>Is it impossible to go back?</i>

209
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:43,830
<i>If only I could do it,
I'd want to return.</i>

210
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,100
<i>My mom must be waiting.</i>

211
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,180
Lady Soo!

212
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,890
Lady, what are you doing here?

213
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,720
It's cold, so you should head inside.

214
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,030
Chae Ryung, you know how I asked you
about that person before?

215
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,540
You still don't know who it is?

216
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,850
There was another visitor
besides the princes.

217
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,120
I'm not too sure.

218
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,810
This house has so many visitors.

219
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,550
I think you need to take a bath.

220
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:20,380
That place I got hurt before...
you said it was a washing area!

221
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,990
It's a girl! It's a girl!

222
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,040
It's a girl!

223
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,170
Hurry up, Lady.

224
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,880
This is not the time for this.

225
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,050
This is the largest
washing area in Songak.

226
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,470
You can't go there.

227
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:42,090
I have a bad feeling about that place.
How can you go back there?

228
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,940
I'll get water drawn up for you,
so you can bathe here.

229
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,860
<i>That man is the person I saw
before I died.</i>

230
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,540
You will get a bruise, a very blue one.

231
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,630
Maybe a deep blue one.

232
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:04,060
You will be more beautiful
than a painting.

233
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,100
I won't let that girl get away with it.

234
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,180
How dare she do this to a prince?

235
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,460
Did you say that your foe was Lady Soo?

236
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,970
From what I've seen and heard,
she is a very lively girl.

237
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:20,070
It isn't easy to meet a lady like that.

238
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:22,730
- You've experienced something rare.
- Yes.

239
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:25,570
It's hard to recognize someone
you only met one time.

240
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,610
It's hard to experience
getting beaten up.

241
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,220
You may have met your fate, Eun.

242
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,220
My fate? Fate, yeah right!

243
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,600
She's more like a fated enemy.

244
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,060
No, you just don't know women very well.

245
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,790
If she had no interest in you,
she wouldn't even touch you.

246
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,730
Then, you're saying...

247
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,600
she hit me because
she's interested in me?

248
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,690
Well, I'm saying it could be,
or it might not be.

249
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,270
<i>[Damiwon Palace]</i>

250
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,580
Your Highness!

251
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,990
I wanted to say hello to you, Mother.

252
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,050
<i>[Queen Yoo]</i>

253
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,510
Have you been well?

254
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,470
I had heard that you arrived.

255
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,280
I would have called for you.

256
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,870
I had met with my brothers and
I thought I should meet with you.

257
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,610
Mother, it seems like So has
learned some martial arts lately.

258
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,170
- Martial arts?
- Yes.

259
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:37,360
He was great when we were
practicing for the ritual earlier.

260
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,150
According to the rumors...

261
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,750
They are just rumors.

262
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,750
Eun mentioned the Shinju government
dying and useless nonsense like that.

263
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,110
You tell me.

264
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,340
Have you learned martial arts?

265
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,570
I have not.

266
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,210
Why would you?

267
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,500
It's not as if they are
raising you to be a tiger.

268
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,730
Why would the Kangs teach martial arts?

269
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,160
Mother, have you heard that
there is a wolf dog in Songak?

270
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,530
They say it is so awful to look at,
that it's worse than a wolf or dog.

271
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,180
They say it is from Shinju, don't they?

272
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,870
It's been a long time since you've
been to the capital, so enjoy your visit.

273
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:30,810
I have set aside a gift for your mother.

274
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:34,270
You no longer need to visit me
while you are here.

275
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,710
You may leave.

276
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:39,660
It's been two years.
You want me to leave already?

277
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:44,520
It is because of your adoptive mother,
who lies around suffering without you.

278
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,020
I plan on staying
a while longer this time.

279
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,310
Why don't I stay in the palace
with my brothers?

280
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,830
That is impossible.

281
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,470
You are a Kang of Shinju.

282
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,600
Have you forgotten that
the moment of your return

283
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,960
would incite the longstanding grudge
between the two households?

284
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,050
You say I was sent there to be adopted.

285
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,610
But I am a hostage.

286
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:24,190
What a thing to say...
How can you say you're a hostage?

287
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:30,090
Mother is only worried that it will be
a bother to your adoptive mother.

288
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,830
Yo is correct.

289
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,470
Why would I send you as a hostage?

290
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:42,220
Since you are saying that,
I will have to trust you.

291
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,150
- Oh, right. I--
- Mother.

292
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,380
I brought you a gift.

293
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,460
Oh my goodness.

294
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:02,870
Jung, I like it very much.

295
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,380
You like hair pieces a lot.

296
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:11,380
So I got this specially made by a
silversmith at the market.

297
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,260
You should wear it for
the spiritual ritual.

298
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,790
Thank you.

299
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,240
I'll get going now.

300
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,870
How can a prince look so lowly?

301
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,850
There is nothing more embarrassing.

302
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:55,650
Once the ritual is over,
make sure to send him back home.

303
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,130
If he insists on staying...

304
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:03,500
call in the army officers
and get him out of my sight.

305
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,070
Do not worry about it.

306
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,330
What right would he have to stay around?

307
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,660
Do you know what?

308
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:13,210
There are so many rumors about So
all over the market.

309
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:17,670
There are people who even say that it's
our mother who made So's face that way.

310
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,750
How is that even possible?

311
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:27,040
Jung, don't bother leaving the palace if
you're going to come back with rumors.

312
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,060
All right.

313
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,160
Prince So.

314
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,620
<i>[Choi Ji Mong]</i>

315
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,250
Why don't you take a bath
before the ritual?

316
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,390
Prepare the bath for the 4th Prince.

317
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,670
Yes, sir.

318
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:02,560
When did So get that scar on his face?

319
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,640
- Do you know?
- No.

320
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,660
I know about his.

321
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,650
Yeah, I know about mine too.

322
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,340
<i>It was definitely that homeless man.</i>

323
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,420
<i>Since I saw the same person,
it could be the start of something.</i>

324
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,950
<i>I might still be alive in the present.</i>

325
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,310
<i>I might be able to go back.</i>

326
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:34,560
<i>There's only one way to find out.</i>

327
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,410
<i>I've beaten up a prince.</i>

328
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,670
<i>I need to go back before
they cut off my arms and legs.</i>

329
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:51,650
<i>It was too hard for me
to survive in this place.</i>

330
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:20,050
Oh, I'm alive!
I thought I was going to die.

331
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:22,080
Oh, oh...

332
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,190
Did you see it?

333
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,130
I asked you if you saw it!

334
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:11,220
Please... please let me live.

335
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:22,260
Forget... me.

336
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,040
Erase it all.

337
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,600
If you don't...

338
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,110
your face will become like this too.

339
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,660
Oh, my heart is racing.

340
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,930
<i>Is the 4th Prince already gone?</i>

341
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,320
<i>Let's clean up.</i>

342
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,580
Lady Soo!

343
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,420
Where have you been?

344
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,830
Were you all waiting for me?

345
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:09,090
Where have you been?

346
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:14,230
I was just so dirty. I went to wash up.

347
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,520
You should tell people
where you are going.

348
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,430
The whole family was worried.

349
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,470
The family?

350
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:31,040
Take the lady inside and warm her up.

351
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,300
Yes. Let's go.

352
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,500
Okay.

353
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,590
Go on. Get inside.

354
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,370
I...

355
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,650
guess I'm home.

356
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,320
- Let's go.
- All right.

357
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:13,350
You are a troublemaker.

358
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:15,730
I told you not to go there.

359
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:20,990
By the way, Chae Ryung,
you know the 4th Prince?

360
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,240
What kind of person is he?

361
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,850
Did you run into him at the bath?

362
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,410
What are you talking about?

363
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,160
I know that it is very possible
for men and women

364
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,420
to meet while bathing in Goryeo.

365
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:36,230
You must avoid the 4th Prince
as soon as you see him.

366
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,940
Avoid him? Why?

367
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,810
His birth mother is Queen Yoo.

368
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:42,620
He was adopted by
Royal Concubine Kang in Shinju.

369
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,580
He is a powerful man with two families.

370
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,470
He is famous for being scary and cruel.

371
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:55,480
Your Highness! Your Highness!

372
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,030
Your Highness!

373
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,150
He didn't die? He's alive?

374
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:24,080
<i>They say it was his hobby to
hunt animals since he was young.</i>

375
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:28,130
<i>There is a rumor that he has caught
every last wolf in all of Shinju.</i>

376
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,810
They say he kills people very easily too.

377
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:37,770
Especially those who have
seen the scar on his face.

378
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,130
People who have seen his scar?

379
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:43,120
<i>Then I really nearly died.</i>

380
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,220
<i>I saw him without his mask.</i>

381
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:50,050
He wouldn't be able to set foot
in Songak if he were not a prince.

382
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,320
- It's a relief, really.
- What?

383
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:56,330
You can't even go where you want
if you have a scar on your face?

384
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:59,670
Do you think you can?
People only like attractive faces.

385
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,950
<i>You have to be well-off to
be treated well even in this time.</i>

386
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,480
<i>It is the same as now.</i>

387
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,450
<i>This crappy world.</i>

388
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:32,100
If abdicating the throne had not come up,
we would not have to rush like this.

389
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,970
He has always acted so strong.

390
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:37,580
What will he be like when he dies?

391
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:40,650
Opportunities like this
do not come often.

392
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,810
You must finish him off
during the spiritual ritual.

393
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,910
I told you that you
do not need to worry.

394
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:57,930
<i>The Crown Prince will be the one
to chase away the evil spirits?</i>

395
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:10,520
<i>[Exorcism rite: a rite aimed to ward off
evil spirits in the 12th lunar month.]</i>

396
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,290
- Done?
- No.

397
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,240
Done?

398
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,940
Welcome.

399
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:55,420
I do not want any woman
to shine brighter than me.

400
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,750
If anyone stands out...

401
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,840
though I do not think that will happen.

402
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:29,360
Three flowers have bloomed in the palace.

403
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,730
Queen Hwangbo, today...

404
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,910
you are looking more elegant.

405
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:40,030
Queen Yoo, you are looking
very beautiful today.

406
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:42,630
Princess Yeon Hwa.

407
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:45,330
Do not just visit your mother,
but visit me as well.

408
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:47,400
Tell me some fun stories about the world.

409
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,720
The princes are no good for that.

410
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,310
I'm worried that my speaking skills are
not good enough to entertain you.

411
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,850
I will visit you soon
with some amusing stories.

412
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:56,930
I will expect you.

413
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,080
Shall we go in, then?

414
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,890
Let's go to the king.

415
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:22,780
Merely running into her makes
the color of the day feel different.

416
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:29,220
It worries me to think that you must deal
with that force alone in the palace.

417
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,100
Brother has to stand by your side
as soon as he can.

418
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,810
It is the palace.
You should be careful with your words.

419
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:39,910
Your sister-in-law is correct.

420
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:42,350
You are still lacking.

421
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,300
It would be better
if you forgot everything.

422
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,320
How can I forget such a grudge?

423
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:54,930
Why didn't you bring Hae Soo?

424
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:59,710
The whole palace already knows
about the disturbance she caused.

425
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,600
She has been making many mistakes
since her injury.

426
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,080
I left her behind to have fun on her own.

427
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:12,090
All right, the king is waiting.
Let's hurry along.

428
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:40,220
The king will be proud to see
all of you here.

429
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:43,400
Once this ritual ceremony is over,
we will have a great feast.

430
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,070
Yes, Crown Prince.

431
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,560
Wook, will your wife
and Hae Soo be attending too?

432
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,830
Yes, I think so.

433
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:56,900
Is that so?

434
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,320
Why? Are you going to get beaten up
for being a bad performer this time?

435
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:05,140
No, this time I will really
give her a piece of my mind.

436
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:08,790
Are you going to get another black eye?

437
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:16,090
Stop laughing.

438
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,470
I told you to stop laughing!

439
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,960
Get over here!

440
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:30,100
Ouch! Oh...

441
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:34,210
Eun, Eun! Are you okay?

442
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:36,040
I got you now.

443
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,880
You're still no match for me.

444
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,020
How dare you behave this way
toward your older brother...

445
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,730
Stop it, you two.

446
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,640
Ouch! Hey!

447
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:29,960

450
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,930
The Jin Jas have gathered.

451
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:41,140
We will now cast out the evil spirits!

452
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:54,670
The Crown Prince is
very good at his role.

453
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,670
He has practically lived
on the battlefields.

454
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,570
The godly monster suffers a scar.
The stomach takes medicine.

455
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:55,150
The oil of a bear eats the spirit.

456
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:57,060
The light engulfs the Buddha.

457
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:01,260
We will call upon 12 gods and
wipe out the evil spirits and disease.

458
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:03,200
I will cut your body.

459
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,590
I will pierce your liver
and slice your flesh.

460
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:09,530
I will pull out your stomach
and intestines.

461
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:27,030
Protect the king!

462
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:45,000
Moo!

463
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:22,630
Catch them!

464
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:32,180
Royal army, follow me!

465
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,790
Crown Prince!

466
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:38,100
Moo!

467
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,080
You... you're the 4th Prince.

468
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,840
Where is the Crown Prince?

469
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:58,720
Where is he?

470
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:03,770
I am here, my king.

471
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:19,470
Are you all right, 4th Prince?

472
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,250
So.

473
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:44,590
I will catch them.

474
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:02,580
Crown Prince.

475
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,990
Look over there. There, too.

476
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:27,270
Over there, too.

477
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,530
- Wow!
- Wow...

478
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,030
Come on.

479
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,180
Honey or sugar?

480
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,690
One, two, three. Honey!

481
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:25,870
Of course!

482
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:26,880
This one.

483
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,930
Let's please rest for a bit.

484
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:44,770
At this rate, I won't be able to marry.
My body will shrivel up.

485
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:48,690
You're much younger than me.
Why are you in such bad shape?

486
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:50,700
We're only one year apart.

487
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,110
Oh, are we?

488
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:12,090
Chae Ryung, wait right here.

489
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:14,520
Lady! Lady Soo!

490
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:39,170
Do you think you'll get out
of this forest alive?

491
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:41,740
Tell me who is behind all of this.

492
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:46,170
If you do, I will speak to the king
about a pardon for you.

493
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,960
I am the 4th Prince, Wang So.

494
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:57,760
Trust in the promise of a prince.

495
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:21,030
Over there... there are people...

496
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:33,720
Kill her.

497
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:38,970
I told you to kill her.

498
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:47,060
If you won't do it, should I?

499
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:06,200
Please... save me.

500
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:09,160
I'll really die if you do this.

501
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:13,800
I don't care what you do to that girl.

502
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:18,110
Stop with the useless acts
and tell me who is behind it all.

503
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:21,370
Now!

504
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:11,650
Why!

505
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:18,680
I almost had him.

506
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:21,560
All because of a girl like you.

507
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:38,310
That's enough.

508
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:43,540
She is an innocent girl. Let her go.

509
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:03,160
I don't want to.
