<i>[This drama has taken
a creative license to history.]</i>

00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,590
<i>[Two years later.
Hyejong, second year of reign.]</i>

4
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,210
Girls, Lady Hae is coming

5
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,410
<i>[Episode 14]</i>
My lady.

6
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,680
I told you not to call me that.

7
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,450
It's become a habit, so I can't fix it.

8
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,320
Also, I'm not used to
calling you Court Lady Hae.

9
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,240
Are these words, as well?

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,600
Yes, they are.

11
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,410
You should learn to read and write too.

12
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,310
How can I, at this age?

13
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,500
I've memorized all the teas
in the pantry

14
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,380
and the herbal medicines,
so I'll be fine.

15
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,540
Happy birthday.

16
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,400
Today is your birthday, Lady.

17
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,550
I'm giving this to you because
your knee is still not well.

18
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,580
It is so pretty.

19
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,060
Thank you.

20
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,180
I will use it whenever my knee hurts.

21
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,860
Still, the best gift is having
you here at the Damiwon.

22
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:47,580
That's because I was emancipated on
your behalf by Prince Wook.

23
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,340
Happy birthday.

24
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,770
I saw it at Byukrando and
I knew it was perfect for you.

25
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,660
It was brought over by
a Persian merchant.

26
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,760
It's from Bulgaria.

27
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,760
It's a rose fragrance.

28
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,040
It's a precious oil made
from distilled rose leaves.

29
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,190
It will be perfect for an incense pouch.

30
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,660
I love it.

31
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,080
So didn't know what to choose,
so he wandered around.

32
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,680
He ended up coming back with nothing
or something like that.

33
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,370
It's just a court lady's birthday.
It's a gift to have a prince here at all.

34
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,750
- What more could you want?
- Yes, that's true.

35
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,630
I'm just a court lady and I should
be happy just to have been born.

36
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:17,750
Was it you who made those
animal sounds just now?

37
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,810
Yes.

38
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,080
I sounded so much like an animal
that I was afraid you wouldn't know.

39
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,740
You're not a dog or a wolf.

40
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,940
It sounded like you were
choking on a rice cake.

41
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,900
Why does it matter?
You're out here, aren't you?

42
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,000
- Let's go.
- What?

43
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,360
I'll show you something good
for your birthday present.

44
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,320
I said let's go.

45
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,530
I'm telling you,
that's called a fixed star.

46
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,630
Oh, that's an anchor star.

47
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,640
You're talking about the North Star.

48
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,410
That's not an anchor star.
That's Cassiopeia.

49
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,140
Have you forgotten how much
I know about astronomy?

50
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,930
I'm telling you that you learned it
wrong from the beginning.

51
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,980
You see Cassiopeia?

52
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,730
Ethiopia's Queen Cassiopeia was bragging

53
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,900
that her daughter was
more beautiful than a sea fairy.

54
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,450
They say she's getting
punished by the sea gods.

55
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,680
Look at that.

56
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,990
Doesn't it look like
an upside down chair?

57
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,310
You should not be vain.

58
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:09,030
They say she is punished for half a day
by being hung upside down in the sky.

59
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:29,410
Long ago, when I was much younger...

60
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,100
I had gone to see my mother
after not seeing her for a long time.

61
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,660
Mother had Jung in her lap.

62
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,350
She was telling him stories.

63
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,540
I wished to myself that
Jung would disappear.

64
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,450
I wanted that seat to be mine.

65
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:59,280
Mother saw that expression on my face
and quickly hid Jung.

66
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:05,080
Perhaps, she already knew that I would
be a person who'd kill my own brother.

67
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,980
People who have
younger siblings all say that.

68
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,910
I was that way, too.

69
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,370
"I wish my younger sibling
would go away."

70
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,100
"Why does that person have to
be around and upset me?"

71
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,330
Are you trying to
make me give up on you or...

72
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,990
do you want me to look only at you?

73
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,610
What?

74
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:39,120
Whenever I come to you,
all my problems seem to become lighter.

75
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,320
So, how can I live without seeing you?

76
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:53,130
If you're not going to come to me,
don't give me hope either.

77
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,160
For me... it is torture.

78
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,830
Didn't you say that
you'd get my permission?

79
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,160
- Can I do it?
- No, you can't.

80
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,140
You said you wouldn't and
you were going to do it, weren't you?

81
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,370
I won't do it, okay?

82
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,290
At this rate, the king will marry you off

83
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,260
as a second wife
to some old, powerful man.

84
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,560
That will never happen.

85
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,670
The king favors me very much.

86
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,230
What a show-off.

87
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,700
You have a day off in a few days, right?

88
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,310
Let's go to the prayer tower together.

89
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,160
Prayer tower?

90
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
I want to tell you something.

91
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:09,850
I think I should tell you there.

92
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,620
You'll come, won't you?

93
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:37,560
The king wants a restructuring
of the of the palace's forces.

94
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,070
Therefore, all the soldiers
of the powerful families

95
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,580
will join the palace army.

96
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,950
They will take turns in
providing that support.

97
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,670
His Majesty's illness
is worsening every day.

98
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,300
You all know it is difficult for him
to attend morning meetings.

99
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:03,760
It is a royal order that we must
not delay this urgent matter.

100
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,200
Wook.

101
00:09:17,707 --> 00:09:19,876
You're stepping out of line a lot lately.

102
00:09:19,876 --> 00:09:24,240
As if you're ruling as a regent with
His Majesty's illness as an excuse.

103
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,280
Nonsense. It didn't pass because of your objection.

104
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,452
I'll be more careful so nobody gets such a wrong impression.

105
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,488
The fact that you're acting as a Senior Minister itself

106
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,691
is already causing a lot of alarm for the clans.

107
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:38,990
If you keep pressuring the clans as if it's His Majesty's will,

108
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,497
their resentment will keep growing.

109
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,034
You're smiling?

110
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:47,303
I thought you were only good at fighting,

111
00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:49,706
but now I see you're also good with politics.

112
00:09:49,706 --> 00:09:51,700
I had to learn in order to face you.

113
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:58,348
I'm still suspicious of you.

114
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,183
I was just trying to fill in for the absence of His Majesty

115
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,551
and overdid it a little.

116
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,153
I'll take your advice.

117
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:10,026
It wasn't something a mere senior minister can do.

118
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,790
<i>[Hyejong]</i>
Lately, after I take a bath...

119
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,820
I feel so weary.

120
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,290
When I wake up from my sleep...

121
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,310
I do not know if it is
yesterday or today.

122
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,490
My memory is so fuzzy.

123
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,980
The doctor says that
you are lacking sleep.

124
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,000
I will provide you tea and a pillow
to help you with your sleep.

125
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,550
I will leave Chae Ryung here,
so please soak a little longer.

126
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,760
Are you adding more herbal medicines?

127
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,670
It will smell too strong.

128
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

129
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,130
I think the herbs have diluted.

130
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,892
Ah...

131
00:11:49,892 --> 00:11:52,295
I heard that there's a lot of demand for mirrors at Damiwon.

132
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:55,965
So I ordered more mercury for making mirrors.

133
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,035
I'm sure they've been delivered?

134
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,039
Yes, Your Highness.

135
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,509
I saw them being received.

136
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,170
Wook, something is wrong with me lately.

137
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,360
I cannot sleep at all.

138
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,790
When I do sleep, I have nightmares.

139
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,030
The summer sun is hot.

140
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,550
So, why I am so cold?

141
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,380
Your Majesty.

142
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,530
I believe... the time has come.

143
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,060
Why don't you abdicate the throne to me?

144
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,400
What?

145
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,520
I know you got Choi Ji Mong
to spread false rumors

146
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,050
that you were the son of a dragon.

147
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:17,660
Because of the severe rashes on
your skin, you have scale-like scarring.

148
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,810
Wook... Wook, you...

149
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,780
If you abdicate to me...

150
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,790
I will help you live in comfort
for the rest of your life.

151
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,280
The throne is a burden.

152
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:37,340
For everyone's sake,
why don't you let that burden go?

153
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,360
Brother.

154
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,070
Come along, Your Highness.
Do not be afraid.

155
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,290
Go on! Go!

156
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,150
You must go in order for us to survive
and for this nation to survive.

157
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,260
Your Majesty,
I do not want to get married.

158
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,090
You dumb child!
This is all to save your life.

159
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:24,610
Get going! Go, go!

160
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,390
Get going! Leave!

161
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,570
Your Majesty, she is still so young.
How can you send her to Khitan?

162
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,430
This is not right.

163
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:37,470
If she marries into Khitan,
they will send troops when I'm in danger.

164
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,540
Did anyone hear that?

165
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,960
I'm sure that I heard horses coming.

166
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,960
Go! You don't know when you'll die here.
You need to go now!

167
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,660
Your Majesty! Father!

168
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,580
<i>Mother, Mother!</i>

169
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,180
Father!

170
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,351
<i>Mother!</i>

171
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,480
Mother!

172
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,750
Mother...

173
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,357
Mother!

174
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,210
You need to go quickly!

175
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,550
- Go now! Go!
- Father!

176
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,300
- Father!
- Get going now!

177
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,680
Please stop!

178
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,810
Khitan?

179
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,100
She will be nothing but a hostage
if she is sent there.

180
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,420
You need to see things straight!

181
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,910
What do you know?

182
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,180
I fear I will be assassinated every night

183
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,920
and I have not slept well even once.

184
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,530
People I once trusted
are now asking me to abdicate!

185
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,560
Telling me to give up the throne.

186
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,730
I will end up dying at this rate.

187
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:58,570
We will all end up dead.
Who will protect us?

188
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,040
Your Majesty.

189
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,750
Will you do it?

190
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:13,970
Will you marry the princess
and protect us?

191
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,650
Have you arrived?

192
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,650
Oh no.

193
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,580
I didn't think you would really come,
so I took my time getting here.

194
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,410
Did you wait long?

195
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,940
You said you had something
important to tell me.

196
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,130
Something important?

197
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,550
Oh, right. I did say that.

198
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,290
What was it again?

199
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,500
What?

200
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,710
I just cannot remember.

201
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,820
What was it again? What was it?
subtitles ripped,synced and added the missing lines by riri13

202
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,710
Why would you ask me that?

203
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:17,970
You asked to meet here and said
I had to come because it was important.

204
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,420
What? Did you get your hopes up high
thinking that it was something great?

205
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,560
Now I feel bad.

206
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,490
No, I didn't.

207
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,590
Really?

208
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,810
I still feel bad,
so let's do something else.

209
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,360
Can't you go any faster?

210
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,760
I want to feel the breeze
if I'm in a boat.

211
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,430
Do you want to row?

212
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,500
I was always curious.

213
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,780
Is this your boat, Your Highness?

214
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,780
I brought it to the palace when I
was younger and first arrived.

215
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,490
I wouldn't have to care about
what others thought of me

216
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,920
if I came out on the boat.

217
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,520
This boat is my favorite thing
in the palace.

218
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:54,770
Strange that it's your favorite thing,
yet I haven't seen you out in it.

219
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,030
Because I like it too much.

220
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:08,710
If I do something I like too much,
I might not want to leave the palace.

221
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,490
I didn't take it out on purpose.

222
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,280
Why are you staring at me?

223
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,350
I was thinking about what it must be like

224
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,970
to turn away from something you like.

225
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:31,210
I was also thinking what a relief it is
that you don't have to do that anymore.

226
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,380
I'm sorry.

227
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,070
For what?

228
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,050
The important thing I wanted to say.

229
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:49,320
For forgetting what I
wanted to say to you.

230
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,220
I'm sure you'll remember soon.

231
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,800
You can take your time.

232
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,410
You made a very big decision.

233
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,800
If I marry the princess

234
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,320
Queen Yoo and the Shinju family

235
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,380
will falsely believe that
I'm in line for the throne.

236
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,800
I will control the other families.

237
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,860
The attacks on the king will be reduced.

238
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,790
You've already calculated that far ahead.

239
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,440
Your political skills
have improved a lot.

240
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,570
There is one thing I cannot solve.

241
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:53,170
Am I back to being a dog on a leash
protecting my brother?

242
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,860
Is this my destiny?

243
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,280
I am sick and tired of having to
turn my back on the things that I like.

244
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,980
Things always go awry.

245
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,910
Tell me.

246
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,020
How can I cut this leash and be free?

247
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:22,160
Most people would bite their owners and
become dogs that take over the house.

248
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,000
Are you telling me to revolt?

249
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,760
Of course not.

250
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,030
Thank you for protecting the king.

251
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,810
He will not hold on to you for long.

252
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,900
This is an appeal from Wang Gyu.

253
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,950
"This is a request I had made
twice to the late king."

254
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,240
"I believe Prince So should be
thrown out of the palace."

255
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,780
"His older brother Yo was already
disloyal to you, Your Majesty."

256
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,890
You can stop.

257
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,170
The point of that appeal...

258
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,340
is likely to get me to
abdicate to you, Wook.

259
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,500
That is why I do not
need to hear any more.

260
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,510
I believe I have given you
the wrong idea, Your Majesty.

261
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,540
I merely wanted to help lessen
the burden for you in any way.

262
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,620
I said it to you out of loyalty.

263
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,510
Did it anger you?

264
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,170
No.

265
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,920
Just like you said...

266
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,860
I plan on sharing
my burden with a brother.

267
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,840
<i>Your Majesty, His Highness
the 4th Prince would like to see you.</i>

268
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,880
Tell him to enter.

269
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,140
Greetings to you, Your Majesty.

270
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:18,720
Yes.

271
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,210
So is going to marry my eldest daughter.

272
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,850
Excuse me?

273
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:31,530
However, the princess is young
and unable to start a family.

274
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:34,220
I said it is fine if
she is the second wife.

275
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:42,470
Choi Ji Mong has chosen a wedding day.

276
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,570
I have taken your advice, Wook.

277
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,390
I plan on abdicating to So soon.

278
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,890
He is my brother and son-in-law.

279
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,240
Who could be more perfect?

280
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,260
Don't you agree?

281
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,160
Of course, Your Majesty.

282
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,840
Congratulations on your marriage.

283
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,200
I hope there are no girls crying
over losing such a good man.

284
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,440
Isn't that right, Your Majesty?

285
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:55,110
Hey, you said you'd do my makeup for me.
Why do you keep staring instead?

286
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:59,920
Our first priority should be
to clear up your skin.

287
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,450
This smells like roses.

288
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:17,940
You didn't put in that Bulgarian
rose oil that I gave you, did you?

289
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,610
My expertise was being questioned,
so why bother saving it?

290
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:25,110
I put in lots of it.
Their skin will become very soft.

291
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:27,430
He wields a sword every day
and is so rough.

292
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,030
Why waste such a precious thing on him?

293
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,220
- Baek Ah!
- Stay still.

294
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,630
You cannot move for two hours.

295
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,900
Please, my lady.

296
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,680
His Highness will like it very much.

297
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,150
Oh, your skin does look much brighter.

298
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:47,250
Your skin looks clearer,
like Hae Soo said it would.

299
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,580
Really? Are all the spots gone too?

300
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:54,420
Yes, your face looks bright and shiny.
It looks very good.

301
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:58,220
Your face was very dark before,
but it's brightened up, Your Highness.

302
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,880
It's even firmer.

303
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,640
Nice going, you two.

304
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,440
Shiny, bright...

305
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:10,630
What are all these words? How disgusting.

306
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,260
Eun, you have it all wrong.

307
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,920
You had the wrong idea about my and
Hae Soo's relationship and bothered me.

308
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,730
Now you go and seduce
your brother-in-law?

309
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,590
At least Hae Soo is not like you.

310
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,900
Stop it already!

311
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:26,650
You really are too much sometimes.

312
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,860
What a bad temper...

313
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,760
Why drag Hae Soo into it because you
envy her good relationship with me?

314
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,760
You're putting many people
in awkward situations.

315
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:45,930
You don't know your own feelings,
Your Highness.

316
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,430
You have a lot of interest in
a wife you claim you don't like.

317
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,430
Why must you act so jaded?

318
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,940
Forget it all!

319
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,540
The most useless thing
in the world is marriage.

320
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,030
Jung, you should just live alone.

321
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,610
So should just forget it
while he still can.

322
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,260
So is getting married?

323
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,610
You didn't know?

324
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:09,390
So is going to become
the king's son-in-law.

325
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,610
I heard that the wedding
is going to be soon.

326
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,470
You heard.

327
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,250
You can hate me and resent me.

328
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,080
It is all my fault.

329
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:47,090
Why would I hate or resent you?

330
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,710
It's not as if you made a promise to me.

331
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,610
I said I would take you
out of the palace.

332
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,360
I said I wanted to see you free.

333
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,200
Everything I said was a promise.

334
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,350
I ended up being unable to keep them.

335
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,360
Are you not even going
to give me an excuse?

336
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:14,450
I've already caused the problem and
you've been hurt.

337
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,090
Whatever reason I give...

338
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,460
I broke your trust,
and that doesn't change.

339
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,780
I don't wish to speak any longer.

340
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,600
I understand.

341
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,650
I won't ask any more questions.

342
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,110
Congratulations...

343
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,750
on your marriage.

344
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,740
<i>Soo, it is Baek Ah.</i>

345
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,910
<i>I'm coming in.</i>

346
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,540
Hello. Come in.

347
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,010
How are you feeling?

348
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,640
I'm doing fine, as always.

349
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:34,290
Well, So wanted me to
give you this letter.

350
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,720
He says you can consider this
his explanation.

351
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,780
<i>"When the water has run dry,"</i>

352
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,610
<i>"Sit and watch for the rising clouds."</i>

353
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,671
Wang Wei's poem "Zhongnan Mountain Retreat".

354
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,370
I had no idea that he wrote so well.

355
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,640
There so much more
I don't know about him.

356
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,580
I was mistaken in thinking
that I knew everything.

357
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,680
How foolish of me.

358
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:19,540
He meant it when he said he wanted
to leave the palace with you.

359
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,510
That, I know for certain.

360
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:43,040
<i>"When the water has run dry,"</i>

361
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,480
<i>"Sit and watch for the rising clouds."</i>

362
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:49,800
<i>"When the water has run dry,"</i>

363
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,110
<i>"Sit and watch for the rising clouds."</i>

364
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,234
<i>While it was hard going back and forth as an envoy,</i>

365
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,070
<i>there were many free moments, too.</i>

366
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:04,372
<i>I always thought of you then.</i>

367
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:09,144
<i>I want to be with you in peace without having to worry about anything.</i>

368
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,546
<i> If I can't do that,</i>

369
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:13,715
<i>the position of king or whatever else</i>

370
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:21,089
<i>is meaningless to me.</i>

371
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:36,440
<i>"When the water has run dry,"</i>

372
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,580
<i>"Sit and watch for the rising clouds."</i>

373
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:44,600
<i>"When the water has run dry.
It's time..."</i>

374
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:50,100
<i>"When the water has run dry,"</i>

375
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,810
<i>"Sit and watch for the rising clouds."</i>

376
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,240
Is my mother inside?

377
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,510
Her Majesty has asked not to let
anyone inside while she is praying.

378
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,260
I am allowed.

379
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,560
I'm worried because
she's been gone for days.

380
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,800
I apologize, but Your Highness...

381
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:52,010
You say you are a general,
but you are not very stoic.

382
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,480
What's going on?

383
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,670
I was planning on telling you.

384
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,120
Do not be alarmed.

385
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,740
It is heaven's will
that your brother lives.

386
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,350
Heaven is on your mother's side, Jung.

387
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,340
Then why did you pretend
to be dead this entire time? Why?

388
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,450
I've been labeled a traitor.
I can't show up on my own.

389
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,820
I barely managed to stay alive.

390
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:30,740
If Uncle Wang Shik Ryeom had not taken
care of me, I would not have made it.

391
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,520
I will request that the king
exonerate you and restore your position.

392
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,010
I have worked hard for him
and he is an affectionate person.

393
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,720
I'm sure he will listen.

394
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,030
Restore me to my position?

395
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,750
I was someone who wanted the throne.

396
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,250
He will kill me as soon as
he finds out that I'm alive.

397
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:59,660
Also, didn't you hear that
So is marrying the princess?

398
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:05,120
It seems that the king is going to
abdicate the throne to So.

399
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,840
I am opposed to So
sitting on the throne as well.

400
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:17,340
However, I cannot take your side if you
plan on revolting against the king.

401
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,780
Committing treason once
is more than enough.

402
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,930
What a foolish thing to say.

403
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,660
A successful plot of treason
is not treason at all.

404
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:30,390
I will sit on that throne. I...

405
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,620
may lose once, but never twice.

406
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,170
I am a loyal subject of the king.

407
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,510
You may be my brother,
but I will not stand idly by.

408
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,970
The king has completely lost his mind!

409
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,550
They say he killed
an assassin in his room.

410
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,650
The truth is...

411
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,450
he was hallucinating
and he killed a court lady.

412
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:54,770
A person like that...

413
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,940
or even a person he chooses...

414
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,600
do you really want to
leave Goryeo in their hands?

415
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,240
Is that what you want?

416
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:09,950
<i>The king has forbidden entry and exit
into and out of the palace at night.</i>

417
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:13,660
<i>It does not matter who it is.
Catch whoever disobeys this rule.</i>

418
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,500
I believe he entered the Damiwon.

419
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,110
There is nowhere he could have gone
except this room.

420
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,760
Should we break the door down?

421
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,230
What is going on here?

422
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,250
Damiwon is not a place that
you can enter so carelessly.

423
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,480
Please leave.

424
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,550
A man who jumped the palace wall
was seen entering here.

425
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,110
We must search your room.

426
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,830
I was reading a book.
I did not see anything.

427
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,560
Please search somewhere else.

428
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,170
Where do you think you are going?

429
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,730
I am the highest court lady
of the Damiwon.

430
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,900
I serve the king directly.

431
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:37,060
I cannot let any random man into my room.

432
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:40,090
Move. I will check myself.

433
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,140
I do not want to.

434
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,320
It is the room of an unmarried girl.

435
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:56,910
Rather than go through that shame,
I would die instead.

436
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:04,020
If you insist on entering,
get the king's permission and return.

437
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,510
There will be no exceptions for anyone.

438
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:14,430
You are sure there is
no one in your room?

439
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,480
Yes.

440
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,130
I am sure of it.

441
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,950
We will search elsewhere.

442
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:33,970
Yes.

443
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,240
Let's go.

444
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,540
Soo!

445
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,390
They could still be here.

446
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,870
Let me see.

447
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,310
You have a scratch on your neck.

448
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,500
Were you really going to
stab yourself with this?

449
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:26,180
If they insisted on coming in,
what else could I do?

450
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,980
Why would you bother
going to such lengths?

451
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,140
You can just let me get caught.

452
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,560
Why would you say such a thing?

453
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,150
You've become more distant
from the 4th Prince

454
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,940
so it's best not to have any run-ins.

455
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:40,350
You would've done this
even if it were not me?

456
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:41,370
What?

457
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,160
Even if it were another brother,
you would have helped out.

458
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,180
Right?

459
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,920
Of course, I would have.

460
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,890
If we end up splitting apart
and fighting...

461
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,960
whose side will you take?

462
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,170
Why would I take sides?

463
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,980
Perhaps, I will be the referee.

464
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,760
You cannot expect us
to go back to the days

465
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,670
of hanging out at
the 8th Prince's home.

466
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:25,480
That's just your greed.

467
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,840
We have changed.

468
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,290
Soon, you will have to choose.

469
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,920
It is getting late.

470
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,680
Get a little sleep and
leave once it gets quiet outside.

471
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,370
Even so...

472
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,240
I don't think I will be able
to take anyone's side.

473
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,010
I do not want anyone to get hurt.

474
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,840
I'm going to make sure no one does.

475
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:23,230
It was Jung in your room
last night, wasn't it?

476
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,420
That never happened.

477
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,870
I thought about breaking your door
down all night. Do you know that?

478
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:33,300
Tell me the truth. It was Jung.

479
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,680
Give me some sort of explanation.

480
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:38,870
Why did you hide Jung?

481
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:43,060
Why don't you give me a proper
explanation first, Your Highness?

482
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:49,450
Not just a poem, but an explanation
that I can actually understand.

483
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,400
Why are you suddenly getting married?

484
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,770
Is it really like what people are saying?

485
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:01,060
Are you greedy for the throne?

486
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:08,780
That child...

487
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:11,880
If I had not done what I did

488
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,860
she would've been sent
to Khitan as a hostage.

489
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,400
There was no other way except marriage.

490
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:27,590
Why didn't you tell me that
to begin with?

491
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:32,010
Then I wouldn't have felt so upset.

492
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:33,940
Also...

493
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,840
Then I would have to
ask you to endure again.

494
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:41,000
I know you hate multiple wives.

495
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:44,590
I tried my best to avoid marriage.

496
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:47,710
There was no other way.

497
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,740
So, what could I say to you and how?

498
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:04,220
Yesterday... it was Jung in my room.

499
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:09,580
It seemed like he forgot the rules
and was practicing his martial arts.

500
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:12,290
Nothing happened.

501
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,080
Don't lie to me from now on.

502
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:24,380
No matter how bad and awful it is,
you and I both want the truth.

503
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,990
What if there's something
we don't want to say?

504
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:30,170
Then what do we do?

505
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,480
Just say you don't want to say it.

506
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:40,000
I really hate people
being vague and lying.

507
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,510
That's what I'll do, then.

508
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:52,990
I won't lie either.

509
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,740
Then... are you not angry anymore?

510
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:12,490
Do you regret getting married?

511
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,990
I don't regret it.

512
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,050
I had no choice
in order to protect the king.

513
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,720
The princess was sent away
to Gaetaesa temple.

514
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,650
That was what we had decided on
before we married.

515
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:35,000
Before...

516
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:40,770
you said that you loved someone.

517
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:42,950
Is that...

518
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:45,600
Jung?

519
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:50,600
Not at all. No.

520
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:58,560
On the day we went on the boat,
you had something important to tell me.

521
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:03,110
You never did forget, did you?

522
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:09,950
What was it?

523
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:26,840
I...

524
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:31,890
love you.

525
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:51,710
Next time, don't forget it.

526
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:58,240
Is this not... a dream?

527
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:03,890
All this time...

528
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,420
I've been thinking about you.

529
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:11,930
I had been hoping...

530
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,800
that the wound you got from me
wouldn't have healed yet.

531
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,850
That way...

532
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:25,200
you wouldn't have forgotten me.

533
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:41,170
I couldn't go to you because I thought
seeing me would make you sad.

534
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,720
Wook.

535
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:10,680
What brings you here, Won?

536
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,510
I brought a guest who
really wants to see you.

537
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,390
A guest?

538
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,100
It's been a long time, Wook.

539
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:50,970
I heard that you got Won to use mercury
inside the Damiwon all this time.

540
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:55,180
It's the smart ones who
turn out to be scary.

541
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:59,760
You see, I'm a very loyal person.

542
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,620
I could not ignore my third brother.

543
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:10,850
It seems like you have
a lot to discuss with me.

544
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:12,460
Of course.

545
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,600
Talking all night would not be enough.

546
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:16,830
I have so much to say.

547
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,570
Attack!

548
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:10,480
Find the king. Hurry!

549
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,630
Yes, sir!

550
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:18,850
Jung, kill me first if you have to go.

551
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:21,855
Move. I must protect the king.

552
00:52:21,855 --> 00:52:25,150
I don't want to see my sons fighting each other.

553
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:28,090
I can't see you die before my eyes again!

554
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:29,830
Mother!

555
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:33,433
Jung, your brother has to become king

556
00:52:33,433 --> 00:52:36,100
in order for everything to go back in its rightful place.

557
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:40,073
Only then will Goryeo be stable and we will have peace.

558
00:52:41,108 --> 00:52:43,710
Do you want me to die?

559
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,660
<i>Where is the king?</i>

560
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:47,740
<i>Do you want to die?</i>

561
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:50,360
<i>Keep looking.</i>

562
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,060
<i>Please let me live.</i>

563
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:00,570
Your Majesty! Your Majesty, what is it?

564
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:05,600
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!
Are you all right?

565
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,400
Your Majesty, what is it?

566
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:15,250
Who is it? Let go of me! Let go!

567
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:17,050
Let go, let go!

568
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:38,710
Save me.

569
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:10,900
Your Majesty!

570
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:15,000
Your Majesty.

571
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,380
Something could go seriously wrong.
Please get him out.

572
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:21,740
Please.

573
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:28,220
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

574
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:38,500
<i>Moo, you were destined to live your
life floundering away like that.</i>

575
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:43,890
<i>If the late king knew you
would live this way</i>

576
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,960
<i>he would not have chosen you to be king.</i>

577
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,560
Your Majesty, please!
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.

578
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:58,270
Your Majesty...

579
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:01,150
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

580
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:19,510
<i>It looks like it is over.</i>

581
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,480
I may lose once.

582
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:30,260
I told you I would not lose twice.

583
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,360
You!

584
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,190
Stop!

585
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,490
Your Majesty.

586
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,180
Your Majesty?

587
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:52,040
Your Majesty.

588
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:56,260
Your Majesty?

589
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:01,900
Moo?

590
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,940
Moo, open your eyes.

591
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:11,960
Moo.

592
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:21,120
Moo!

593
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,900
I didn't kill him.

594
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:40,030
He was already addicted
to poison and dying.

595
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,010
What?

596
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,620
That girl Hae Soo put mercury
in the king's bath water.

597
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:58,000
The king did not get baths
from anyone except you.

598
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:02,560
There is mercury in the bath water.

599
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:04,810
How did that happen?

600
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:11,400
I do not know anything about it.

601
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:13,930
I will give you two choices.

602
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:19,430
You can show your loyalty to
our dead brother and die with the girl

603
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:24,650
or you can accept me and save the girl.

604
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:31,100
Of course, Hae Soo's crime of
poisoning the king will remain.

605
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:35,300
Whenever I need to...

606
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:39,100
I will take her in
for the crime of regicide.

607
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:53,210
Let Soo go now!

608
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:58,260
Wolves are known to follow
one female wolf until death.

609
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,500
You are an animal, after all.

610
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:03,790
Won!

611
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:12,060
Make a choice.

612
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:15,630
Is it Hae Soo or...

613
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:17,580
the dead king?
