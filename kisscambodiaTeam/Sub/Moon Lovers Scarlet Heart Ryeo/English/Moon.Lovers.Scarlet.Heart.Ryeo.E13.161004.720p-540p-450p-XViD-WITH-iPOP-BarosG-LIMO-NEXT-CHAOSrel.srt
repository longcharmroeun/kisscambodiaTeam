<i>[This drama has taken
a creative license to history.]</i>

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,520
Soo!

4
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,290
A prince marrying a water maid?

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,620
Don't manipulate Soo with such lies.

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,800
If I say it is marriage, it is marriage.

7
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,800
You!

8
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,250
Stop pretending to care about her

9
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,360
and turn your back on her
like you've been doing.

10
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,540
You're no longer in-laws.

11
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,370
She has nothing to do with you.

12
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,790
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

13
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,600
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

14
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,840
Your Majesty.

15
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,510
Your Majesty!

16
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,220
What should we do, Yo?

17
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,030
Find our eighth brother now!

18
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,590
Run. Hurry.

19
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,150
Take His Majesty back now.

20
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,290
Yes.

21
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,540
<i>[Episode 13]</i>

22
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,860
Is this how I will go?

23
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,670
Where are you saying you will go?

24
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,990
Please do not say weak things
that do not even suit you.

25
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,450
How short and fleeting it was.

26
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,230
What have I been
living for all this time?

27
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,790
You have founded an empire, Your Majesty.

28
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,780
An empire?

29
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:15,250
Will Goryeo last forever?

30
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,390
Did I make the right decision
in choosing Crown Prince Moo?

31
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,440
We can confirm that you made
the right decision, Your Majesty.

32
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,360
The Crown Prince will rise to the throne.

33
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,870
I see I have very good friends.

34
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,640
My war is over now.

35
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,620
Now, your battle is starting.

36
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,230
Watch over the Crown Prince...

37
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,480
and the 4th Prince, as well.

38
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,860
Your Majesty.

39
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,790
Let's get married.

40
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,780
What?

41
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,850
While it was hard to travel as an ambassador.

42
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,980
I often felt very free.

43
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,490
I thought of you every time.

44
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,550
I wanted you to feel freedom like that.

45
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,540
Come with me.

46
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,610
The Crown Prince must not
find out about this situation.

47
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,960
All roads out of Songak
have been blocked.

48
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,880
The moment that the king passes away

49
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,230
we must secure his last decree
and grab our chance at victory.

50
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,360
Wook, how is the king?

51
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,860
What are you doing?

52
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,820
Your Highnesses, you should all return.

53
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,460
His Majesty will give his commands soon.

54
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,360
We cannot do that.

55
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,650
If the king is suffering from an illness

56
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,640
we need to protect Cheondeokjeon
so his last decree remains unchanged.

57
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,400
It's not that you wish to
change his last decree?

58
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,600
If you do not wish
to be suspected of that

59
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,240
you should all leave this place.

60
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,550
I do not see So.

61
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,820
What?

62
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,160
Whoever steps into Cheondeokjeon
without His Majesty's permission...

63
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,780
will be stabbed as a criminal
guilty of treason.

64
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,030
So, it is best for you to all leave now.

65
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,490
Move! I must see the king for myself.

66
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,770
You dare to stop me? Do you wish to die?

67
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,020
Step aside.

68
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,200
Ji Mong, are you hiding
the condition of the king?

69
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,990
I apologize.

70
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,430
What about the princes?
You haven't harmed them, have you?

71
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,140
Of course not.

72
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,140
The princes have returned to their homes.

73
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,320
You are buying time until
the Crown Prince arrives.

74
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,100
Your Majesty.

75
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,160
Even the aroma of your tea
is like that of Soo Yeon's.

76
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,590
Are you feeling all right?

77
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,650
I will be dying soon.

78
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,040
Bring the Crown Prince.

79
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,400
He must come before it's too late.

80
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,180
You want me to do it?

81
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,360
I will find someone who can go quickly.

82
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,800
No, it must be you.

83
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,410
No one from inside the palace...

84
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:45,450
must find out about my death
before the Crown Prince arrives.

85
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,480
What?

86
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:54,280
Once you leave this room,
someone will approach you.

87
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,280
That person will ask you
about my condition.

88
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,400
To the person who merely asks how I am...

89
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,740
tell that person
I am asking for more tea.

90
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,670
To the person who asks if I am dead,
you need to be careful.

91
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,410
That person is after the throne.

92
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,230
<i>Get going.</i>

93
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,590
<i>You cannot trust anyone.</i>

94
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:43,930
<i>The fate of the Goryeo Empire
rests on your shoulders.</i>

95
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:50,420
<i>That is probably
the reason you are here.</i>

96
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,760
- Be on guard.
- Yes, Grand General.

97
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,160
Step aside unless you want to die.

98
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,580
No one can leave Songak.

99
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,750
I'm sure these are Wook's orders.

100
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,040
My suspicions were correct.

101
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:33,280
Last night, I saw that Wook
was wearing his armor.

102
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,080
I saw it very clearly under his sleeve.

103
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,240
I wondered why he would secretly
wear armor into the palace.

104
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,700
Was he planning on killing the king
at the peace gathering?

105
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,160
Soo.

106
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,740
Where are you off to in such a hurry?

107
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,260
The king is asking for more tea.

108
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,650
I am going to the Damiwon.

109
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,140
What is this about marriage with So?

110
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,690
I didn't know you had
that kind of relationship.

111
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:36,930
I was surprised.

112
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,780
You're mistaken. The 4th Prince was...

113
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,190
I have errands to run for the king.

114
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,930
I will speak to you once I return.

115
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,610
- I...
- By any chance...

116
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:03,570
Has the king passed away?

117
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,510
I'm worried about him.

118
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:14,190
Has the king died?

119
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:17,790
<i>To the person who asks if I am dead,
you need to be careful.</i>

120
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,010
That person is after the throne.

121
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,370
Your Highness...

122
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,040
do you...

123
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,200
want to become king?

124
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,360
Last night's events are not important.

125
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,020
The king has passed out now.

126
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,570
The question is,
who will sit on the throne?

127
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,300
The king's successor is Crown Prince Moo.

128
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,950
That is his will.

129
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,620
What do you want, So?

130
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,130
Do you want to become king?

131
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,430
Are you...

132
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,780
going to become king?

133
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:22,050
Is becoming king something so easy
that you can become one if you want?

134
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,270
You can become one if I help you.

135
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:28,420
If the Hwangbos and I support you

136
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,210
you can become king.

137
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,550
When I lost you...

138
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,930
I could not do anything with
the limited power that I had.

139
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,830
In order to protect those
I love inside this palace

140
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,360
I realized that I need to
become the most powerful.

141
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,130
What can one do if they become king?

142
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,580
The world will become yours.

143
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,500
You can have everything.

144
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,410
Then can I have a
person's heart, as well?

145
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:11,500
If I become king,
will the heart I so desire become mine?

146
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,320
You asked if I am going to become king.

147
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,080
I am going to become king.

148
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,260
If so...

149
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,100
I will do it.

150
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:31,470
I will... become king.

151
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,620
Your Majesty, are you all right?

152
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,100
Your Majesty.

153
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,060
Are you awake?

154
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,060
Soo Yeon...

155
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,700
He has passed away.

156
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,740
No.

157
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,800
How can you leave me behind?

158
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,260
Open your eyes!

159
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,490
Queen Yoo.

160
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,790
You cannot leave me behind like this.

161
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,520
Come back!

162
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,060
You can't leave like this!

163
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,260
You can't throw me away like this!

164
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,310
Your Majesty! Come back.

165
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,730
Come back! Open your eyes.

166
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:34,390
Come back, come back!

167
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,190
Wake up.

168
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,120
Come back to me.

169
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,790
You terrible person.

170
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,110
For your sake, I will become king.

171
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:55,070
For my sake?
You're doing this because of me?

172
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,610
It has already started.

173
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,330
Tomorrow, I will attack Cheondeokjeon
with my third brother.

174
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,040
No, you can't do that.

175
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,040
That is treason.

176
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,990
Soo! The Crown Prince will
not be able to return anyway.

177
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,370
Fighting over an empty seat is
just a battle over a throne.

178
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,680
So, do not say anything to anyone.

179
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,500
You only to need to hide and wait for me.

180
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,190
You can do that, right?

181
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,020
I will ask you one more time.

182
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:40,660
Has the king died already?

183
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,520
The king...

184
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,170
has asked for more tea.

185
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,900
Crown Prince Moo is in Chahyeon.

186
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,870
You will not be able to
get him here on your own.

187
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,720
You want to become king just
to win over someone's heart?

188
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,810
The throne is not a seat
to trifle with in that way.

189
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,460
To me, that is all it is.

190
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,500
Open up the road.

191
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,760
If you do not do so,
I will assume you are plotting treason.

192
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,410
I am only stopping people from traveling
to prevent treason while the king is ill.

193
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,420
I can't open the road for a person when
I don't know who he will bring back.

194
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,820
There are no exceptions. Please return.

195
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,770
You ruined everything.

196
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:22,480
If it weren't for you,
I would've killed the king.

197
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,100
Did you pretend to be a gisaeng
this whole time just to kill the king?

198
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,500
You are a very scary girl.

199
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,570
Why did you do it?

200
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:37,140
What kind of deep grudge did you have
that you would do that?

201
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,380
Your father...

202
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,640
killed my family.

203
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,090
All of them.

204
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,050
I was the only one left.

205
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,790
All of them.

206
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,320
Is that why you have
the scars on your wrist?

207
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,680
Because of my father?

208
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,930
I am sorry.

209
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,050
I will beg in his place.

210
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,120
I am sorry.

211
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,790
I am sorry for being his son.

212
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:07,190
I have to assume that the king
must be dead by now.

213
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,050
Or he is very close to it.

214
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:13,770
Then, will the Crown Prince
take his place on the throne?

215
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,620
Oh, good thing you're here.

216
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,730
Do you have any news about Cheondeokjeon?

217
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,730
Has the king died, by any chance?

218
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,430
Don't speak so carelessly.

219
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:30,610
He must have more energy now after
drinking tea from the Damiwon.

220
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,820
Why would you say that?

221
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,950
Are you certain?

222
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,310
Then why is he holding
the queens hostage?

223
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,490
Hostage?

224
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,790
Have they not returned
from Cheondeokjeon?

225
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:45,340
They are likely keeping them there
to keep news from leaking out.

226
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,480
I will go back there.

227
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,930
By the way, where did you hear
about the Damiwon?

228
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,800
Who said that tea was served?

229
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:00,080
They said that the king was getting
his appetite back with Hae Soo's tea.

230
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,990
She served him tea
both last night and today.

231
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,500
Find that girl.

232
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,200
That girl is the only one
who knows the condition of the king.

233
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,310
We have to stop her from telling
the Crown Prince about the king.

234
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,660
Find her. Now!

235
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,070
Have you seen Hae Soo?

236
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,380
I don't know her.

237
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,200
You know, that water maid
from the Gyobang.

238
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,120
Why don't you know her?

239
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,140
The king has passed away.

240
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,390
What?

241
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:07,440
When I last saw him,
he was just about to die.

242
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,130
By now...

243
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,550
He told me to bring the Crown Prince
without anyone finding out.

244
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:24,320
The 3rd Prince is going to attack
Cheondeokjeon tomorrow.

245
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,370
You need to bring the Crown Prince
and stop him.

246
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,680
How do you know this?

247
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,910
Is that what's important right now?

248
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,820
The Crown Prince is in Hubaekje.

249
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,090
All the roads out of Songak are blocked.

250
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,360
We need to find another way out.

251
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,360
You said Hubaekje?

252
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,670
I know someone who might know the way.

253
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:02,250
Because the king has passed out,
no one is left who will recognize you.

254
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,890
Would it be wrong to ask you
to forget everything and be with me?

255
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,090
Woo Hee!

256
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,230
You said your hometown
is Hubaekje, right?

257
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,930
Why are you suddenly asking?

258
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,900
We need to go get the Crown Prince.

259
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,000
- What?
- How can I trust this girl?

260
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,550
She's my friend. You can trust her.

261
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:35,090
I don't know what it is,
but she is all right.

262
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,710
It seems the king has passed away.

263
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:42,780
What?

264
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,480
Are you positive?

265
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,830
We have to assume it.

266
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:02,470
Soon, Yo and Wook...

267
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,870
they will attack Cheondeokjeon
to go after the throne.

268
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,380
I will stop them,
so you go get the Crown Prince.

269
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,740
It should take two days.

270
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,950
Wook has blocked all the roads out.

271
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:26,620
There is a road in and out of Songak
that only I know.

272
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:37,940
If So was trying to leave Songak,
he was going to get the Crown Prince.

273
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,500
You don't think the king
has already died, do you?

274
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,750
I don't know yet.

275
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,380
I haven't heard from Mother,
who is inside Cheondeokjeon.

276
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,510
So, no one knows the king's condition.

277
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,900
This is an opportunity.

278
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,770
Attack Cheondeokjeon now
and get Mother out.

279
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,400
Announce that the king decreed
you to be the next king.

280
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,070
No one will be able to refute it.

281
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,410
You have no fear.

282
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,320
You want to alter the king's last decree?

283
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,910
We can't lose everything
while pondering for too long.

284
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,070
I told you already.

285
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,160
I do not want to become king
with people calling me a traitor.

286
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,110
I do not want anyone to
pick at my weaknesses.

287
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,760
I do not want any flaws.

288
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:21,180
I don't know what
your true intentions are.

289
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,030
You wore your armor when you
entered the palace yesterday.

290
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,770
I thought you were
on the same side as Yo

291
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,410
but you will not kill the Crown Prince.

292
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,890
I am confused.

293
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,830
I am prioritizing.

294
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,500
Who would be more advantageous
to attack first?

295
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:43,090
The Crown Prince or my third brother?

296
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,000
Or...

297
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,480
I cannot make a single mistake
on my path to the throne.

298
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,470
You have changed, Wook.

299
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,070
You're not being forcefully dragged.

300
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:08,100
You seem to sincerely
want the throne now.

301
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,690
I am happy.

302
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,620
If the situation will not change,
then I must change.

303
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:21,250
The thing that worries me most now...

304
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,500
is the betrayal of one person.

305
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,270
What is it? Do you want to sit in it?

306
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,550
No.

307
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,120
I don't like it.

308
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,470
Everyone risks their lives for that seat.

309
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,870
You don't like it?

310
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,630
The king threw Court Lady Oh aside
in order to protect that seat.

311
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,280
And you, Your Highness...

312
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,510
will have to fight your brothers.

313
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,840
It is a scary seat.

314
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,430
Even if you fight tomorrow

315
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,640
you won't hurt them, right?

316
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,920
Are you worried about Wook?

317
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,050
I guess you still
consider him a relative.

318
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,930
Then why did you come to me?

319
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,700
You could have just stood by and watched.

320
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,550
He said it was for my sake.

321
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,920
He was angry that he could not
do anything when I got kicked out.

322
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,630
He couldn't help
and had to leave me alone.

323
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:07,270
He says he wants more power.

324
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,730
I see.

325
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,960
I felt that way back then too.

326
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:22,320
The king told me to live my life
rationally and according to reason.

327
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,040
That is why I am siding
with the Crown Prince.

328
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,200
But if the 8th Prince
were to get injured...

329
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:41,090
I would be scarred forever.

330
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,810
All right.

331
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,130
I can't be confident about it,
but I will try.

332
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,060
I don't want Wook to die either.

333
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,830
I could die too.

334
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,110
Are you not worried about me?

335
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:04,252
<i>You are Gwangjong.</i>

336
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,980
<i>You have a long history ahead of you.</i>

337
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,750
Even people who don't seem like they'll ever die...

338
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,258
eventually die.

339
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,740
You will be fine, Your Highness.

340
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:27,690
I don't know much else,
but I'm sure about that.

341
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,820
Get away.

342
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,070
He is mine. Do not touch him.

343
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:12,730
His Majesty would not like
you acting this way.

344
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,920
What do you know?

345
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:18,970
Have you ever even been loved by him?

346
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,120
Move that hand!

347
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,480
Please do not get caught up
in your emotions and cause a scene.

348
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,400
Your Majesty.

349
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:53,190
I would like to see him briefly.

350
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:59,470
How did you get in here?

351
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:03,620
What about Yo? Is Jung here?

352
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,380
His last words were...

353
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,240
that life is short.

354
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:44,150
He said life was short and fleeting.

355
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,400
And fleeting, yet again.

356
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,860
<i>[Two years earlier, Shinju]</i>

357
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:13,460
The king must think sending a mask
every year is enough fatherly affection.

358
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,430
Ji Mong.

359
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:30,140
How many men and weapons
does Cheondeokjeon have?

360
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,430
Go check with Grand General Park.

361
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,970
Once the sun comes up...

362
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:42,730
3rd Prince Yo and 8th Prince Wook
will be raising a rebellion.

363
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:48,560
The king wished to hand the throne
to the Crown Prince.

364
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,690
We should make that happen.

365
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,770
I will go talk to Grand General Park.

366
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,370
Did you really just say Wook?

367
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,040
I think I must have heard wrong.

368
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,760
I apologize.

369
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,120
A rebellion? What about Yo?

370
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,770
Yes. He is probably coming for me.

371
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:17,370
He is coming to see why you all
have me locked up in here.

372
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,100
Do not harm Yo.

373
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,860
If you touch one hair on his body,
I will kill you myself.

374
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:31,550
You expect him to live
after committing treason?

375
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,200
You are too greedy.

376
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,560
Leave my son alone!

377
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:50,010
What do you mean treason? What treason?

378
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,880
Shut your mouth.
Why are you being stupid?

379
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,390
With one wrong move,
your son and mine will both die.

380
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,730
We need to come up with
a plan to save our children.

381
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:06,050
Forget that you're a woman
and remember that you are a mother.

382
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,270
Understand?

383
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,530
Whoa!

384
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,950
We need to keep going.

385
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,270
We need to take a break
in order to arrive a bit earlier.

386
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,820
If we keep going like this,
your wound will open up more.

387
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,740
We might not arrive at all.

388
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,994
I wasn't trying to hide that
I was a prince from the beginning.

389
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:56,597
I wasn't trying to fool you.

390
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,660
I know.

391
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,380
You're not like that.

392
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,290
I hid things from you too.

393
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,790
We're even.

394
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:22,790
I could just be a musician
and you could be a gisaeng.

395
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,160
I wonder what it would've been like
if that were true.

396
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,790
If so...

397
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,400
would we have an entirely
different relationship?

398
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:43,960
Rest up a little more.

399
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,200
We just need to cross one mountain.

400
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:55,240
Then... we will be in Hubaekje.

401
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,380
It's my hometown.

402
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:02,970
We will have to part ways tomorrow.

403
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,960
We won't have a reason to meet again.

404
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,030
I don't want to.

405
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:13,750
All right.

406
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,130
I guess that's how you feel.

407
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:29,100
Since we won't see
each other again, then...

408
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,800
can I do whatever I want for tonight?

409
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,900
It's strangely too quiet.

410
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,210
It's as if they are expecting us.

411
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:25,550
Most of the military is out
with the Crown Prince.

412
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,530
There are not many soldiers left.

413
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:32,340
Even if they were to come back now,
it would take them a whole day.

414
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,820
I have a request to ask of you.

415
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,880
What is it? Ask me anything.

416
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,460
If 4th Prince So tries to stop us...

417
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,510
please make sure to kill him.

418
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,180
There's no need to request that of me.

419
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:55,390
I will make sure to kill him.

420
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,890
You dare to bring an army to
a place where the king lives?

421
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,900
This is treason!

422
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,790
My mother has been in there
for over a day.

423
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:39,230
I need to know the truth behind why
Cheondeokjeon has been sealed off.

424
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:42,860
I have told you that
the king needs his rest.

425
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,540
Do you think I would believe
such an blatant lie?

426
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,680
Let my mother out now

427
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,250
or I have to assume
you're pushing out the Crown Prince.

428
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,800
And you are planning to
take over the throne.

429
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:20,560
Crown Prince!

430
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,670
Wook, go to Cheondeokjeon now.

431
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:47,460
You're going to betray me now?

432
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:51,450
We were never on the same side,
so it is not betrayal.

433
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:55,220
I heard about your plan from Wook.

434
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,200
I was on my way back
after receiving a letter.

435
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,520
Wook, you proved your loyalty this time.

436
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,010
It was my honor, Crown Prince.

437
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,900
So, it was a trap to catch me?

438
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,900
His Majesty...

439
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,800
has just died.

440
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,640
He has left a decree stating that
Crown Prince Moo shall be the next king.

441
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:57,040
The queens have acknowledged
and received the decree.

442
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:00,250
I deliver this message to you,
Your Highnesses!

443
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,150
Father...

444
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,740
Greetings to the new king, Your Majesty.

445
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:11,850
Long live the king! Long live the king!

446
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,500
Greetings to the king, Your Majesty.

447
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,470
Long live the king! Long live the king!

448
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:22,130
What are you all doing?

449
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:25,830
Greet your new king!

450
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:29,400
Long live the king! Long live the king!

451
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,470
Is he really dead?

452
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:34,220
I cannot believe it.

453
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,590
Your Majesty.

454
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,920
Father.

455
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,220
Father.

456
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,650
<i>Wait and see, Your Majesty.</i>

457
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:02,240
<i>You always thought I was too ambitious.</i>

458
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:07,270
<i>I, Yeon Hwa, will make this empire mine.</i>

459
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,350
Are you crazy?

460
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:20,790
We must go now and say
our last goodbyes to the king.

461
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:22,800
You cannot go to the palace.

462
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,180
You are very sick right now.

463
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:29,220
What do you mean? I'm not sick.

464
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,570
You're so deathly ill
that you can't go to the funeral.

465
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:33,830
You won't be able to attend
when the new king is enthroned.

466
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:37,030
That way... that way, you can live.

467
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:43,780
Why would I die?
Explain it so I understand.

468
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:47,070
Do you know what a new king does
once he gets on the throne?

469
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,510
He kills off all male siblings and
nephews who will threaten his position.

470
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,050
Kill?

471
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:05,710
You need stay as silent as a mouse
if you want to live.

472
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:08,990
You need to make the new king
completely forget about us.

473
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:15,770
Why are you giving me your armor?

474
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:19,060
You want me to wear my wife's armor
to save my own life?

475
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:21,980
I noticed that you tend to
look down on your husband.

476
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,590
Then... should we die together?

477
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:29,360
Are you crazy? Why would I die with you?

478
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:36,910
Why should we die at all?

479
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:42,770
Let's both... live.

480
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:46,710
Life and death are matters of luck.
I'd rather not die together.

481
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:50,100
We are married,
so we shouldn't die alone.

482
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,560
Your Highness!

483
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,330
You were on the Crown Prince's side.

484
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:08,040
Why did you lie to me like that?

485
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,750
You did it on purpose, right?

486
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:17,460
You were testing me.

487
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:21,510
And... you went to So in the end.

488
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:28,810
You weren't planning to
kill the 4th Prince, were you?

489
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:36,710
It was not a lie that
I plan on becoming the king.

490
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:41,020
Nothing bad will come from getting rid
of those who will get in my way later.

491
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:44,460
I...

492
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,480
I was the cause of what happened
to Court Lady Oh.

493
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,380
You knew how much pain that caused me.

494
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,660
Yet, you were going to use me
to kill the 4th Prince?

495
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,540
You have changed.

496
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,090
You are not the person I once knew.

497
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:07,640
What about you?
Why did you hide the truth from me?

498
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,720
I wanted you to tell me
that the king had died.

499
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:16,890
Didn't you care if I would die or not?

500
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:21,480
The king asked me to help the
Crown Prince become the next king.

501
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,750
That was what was logical.

502
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:26,230
I could not go against that and...

503
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:34,790
the 4th Prince had promised
that he would not kill you.

504
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:42,040
You pleaded for my life with So?

505
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:48,100
You said to me before.

506
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:52,930
That we should leave Songak
and leave in peace.

507
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:58,580
I can do that now.

508
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,750
If you ask the new king,
he will allow it.

509
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:05,930
Even if we do that,
another problem will arise.

510
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:08,110
There is no other way.

511
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:19,440
You said you were doing this for me.

512
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,660
You are fooling yourself.

513
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:33,610
Now...

514
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,660
I cannot have the same feelings for you
as I did in the past, Your Highness.

515
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,830
I want to keep my distance from you.

516
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,620
Is it because of the 4th Prince?

517
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,620
For even one moment...

518
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:58,540
have you ever been sure
of my feelings for you?

519
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:04,900
Have you ever completely trusted me?

520
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,840
I will make you come back to me.

521
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,140
It won't be easy.

522
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:52,190
Don't hunt him like he's an animal.

523
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,670
I'll do it. I can convince him.

524
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:07,730
Don't do it.

525
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,660
Can you handle him until the end?

526
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,680
He is still your older brother.

527
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:41,280
Give up already.

528
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:44,680
If it were you, would you give up?

529
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,810
Yo!

530
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:02,670
Yo... Yo!

531
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:53,900
It's not possible.

532
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,860
It is not possible.

533
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,900
It is not possible!

534
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,600
Why would Yo?

535
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,120
This would not happen to me.

536
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:12,630
I will find him.

537
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:14,180
I can find him.

538
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:19,170
Yo... he always comes when I call, Jung.

539
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:20,460
Mother.

540
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:27,090
I told him to stay away from him.

541
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:31,420
He ended up taking my child!

542
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,330
Jung.

543
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:39,700
Jung, this can't be happening to me.

544
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,880
Jung, Jung!

545
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:45,240
I am here. I will stay with you.

546
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,150
I will not leave you, Mother.

547
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:49,060
Yo!

548
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:53,460
My child, my child!

549
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:54,810
Yo!

550
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,040
What's the matter?

551
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:44,390
If I came to you,
I didn't think you would forgive me.

552
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:47,690
But I thought you would understand.

553
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:57,080
I...

554
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:02,070
stabbed my older brother.
