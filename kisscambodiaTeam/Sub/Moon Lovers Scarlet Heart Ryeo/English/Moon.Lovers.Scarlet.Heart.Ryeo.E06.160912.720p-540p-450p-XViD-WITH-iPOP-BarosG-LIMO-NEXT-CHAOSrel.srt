[Episode 6]

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,950
[Spirit Tablet of Wife of
Prince Wook, Lady Hae.]

3
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,900
Myung Hee.

4
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,020
Will I be able to see her again?

5
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,100
I miss her already

6
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,800
What I'm going to do now?

7
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,500
You just have to look for her.

8
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,900
Me too. I will just look for you.

9
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,700
I like that.

10
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,700
To have a friend like that.

11
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,570
Leave it.

12
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,520
Why couldn't I say it?

13
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,420
I knew she wanted so badly to hear it.

14
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,480
I couldn't tell her I loved her.

15
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,170
I did not think I did.

16
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,540
But, Soo...

17
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,240
those feelings were love.

18
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,440
I thought I was just grateful.

19
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,790
It was love.

20
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,390
I thought she was just comforting.

21
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,960
It was love.

22
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,800
What...

23
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,500
What should I do now?

24
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,750
What now?

25
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,560
What can I do now, Soo?

26
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,110
I should have told her.

27
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,300
She had waited so long.

28
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,590
I'm sure Myung Hee already knew.

29
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,320
She already knew.

30
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,780
You can stop now.

31
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,430
Okay?

32
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,180
Why now?

33
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,610
Why now?

34
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,840
I received all of her love.

35
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,850
Why? Why, why, why, why?

36
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,840
Why did I just realize now?

37
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,650
What will happen now?

38
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,750
What am I supposed to do with my life?

39
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,470
I can't think of anything.

40
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,560
Who is it?

41
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,060
Who is that?

42
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,310
Oh my! Those men with
no clothes on are the princes.

43
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,970
You indecent girl.

44
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,400
You need to get into trouble.

45
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,410
What is that? Are you making fun of me?

46
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,200
Aren't you a prince?

47
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,900
You need to get a beating.

48
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,660
Hey! Let go.

49
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,080
You let go first!

50
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,280
How impudent!

51
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,620
Impudent, yeah right!

52
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,270
How dare you speak that way to a prince?

53
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,900
Prince, yeah right!

54
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,240
You dare to hit a girl?

55
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,650
You're as tiny as a grain of rice.

56
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,570
Ouch, ouch!

57
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,470
What are you doing?

58
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,100
Where did you get the idea
to do a puppet show?

59
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,620
I'm a little bit touched.

60
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,340
Your Highness, you're awesome.

61
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,140
I'm relieved to hear you enjoyed it.

62
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,560
I thought you might be feeling down
since my sister-in-law's death.

63
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,230
By the way, what is this?

64
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,620
Awesome... the best.

65
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,710
The thumb is the head
of the five fingers.

66
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,030
That's not right!

67
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,620
There is the mighty king,
so how could that be me?

68
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,660
Maybe if it's this one.

69
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,210
This one is good too.

70
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,980
10th Prince, you were
really awesome today.

71
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,150
I was able to laugh thanks to you.

72
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,560
It's too bad I'm the only
awesome person in your life.

73
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,140
Your Highness, you were the best today.

74
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,590
I was, wasn't I?

75
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,150
- That's enough, now.
- Your Highness, you're so funny.

76
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,060
- Am I really?
- Stop that.

77
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,120
Your Highness, you're the best looking.

78
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,880
- Oh, am I?
- I said stop already.

79
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,780
- Who do you like most?
- Prince Eun, of course!

80
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,140
I said stop.

81
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,140
You still have to apologise for me.

82
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,140


83
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,180
You misunderstood my mother and I.

84
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,180


85
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,980
Barking at others is your potential.

86
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,980


87
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,490
We might be brothers,

88
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,490


89
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,520
but you should at least greet properly.

90
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,520


91
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,830
About greeting, shouldn't I be the to receive it?

92
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,830


93
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,160
I saved him from dying.

94
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,160


95
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,130
How long do you plan to stick bye his side?

96
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,130


97
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,710
That's why I exchanged my life for it.

98
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,710


99
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,340
What?

100
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,340


101
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:03,410
Hyungnim, have you heard the news that Later Baekje will live in Songak?

102
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:03,410


103
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,350
His Majesty will grant each of them a field to live.

104
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,350


105
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:12,490
Whether Balhae or Later Baekje, His Majesty will end them.

106
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:12,490


107
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,090
This is what Goryeo is like.

108
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,090


109
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:18,530
Yeah, the collaping of Nate is only a matter of time.

110
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:18,530


111
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,100
Look at the 13th's grandfather,

112
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,100


113
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,470
the mighty be Silla Emperor

114
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,470


115
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,670
is now relying on the King to survive.

116
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,810


117
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,810
How can he even show up in the palace?

118
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,910
Is crawling heredity?

119
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,910


120
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:37,320
But... We are nothing without the King just like them.

121
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:37,320


122
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,550
We are eating the same food given by the owner,

123
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,550


124
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,920
and yet you talk like this.

125
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,920


126
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,890
What?

127
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,890


128
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,960
Whether we crawl or eat like a dog,

129
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,960


130
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,060
you're still a coward for not being able to say anything in front the owner.

131
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,060


132
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,070
So stop saying useless things.

133
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,070


134
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,070
Rather than living like this, it's better to drink some alchool.

135
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,070


136
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,140


137
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,920
Baek Ah, do you drink?

138
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,920


139
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,320
Yeah, hyungnim. 
Drinking is my talent.

140
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,320


141
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,830
Thank you, hyungnim.

142
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,830


143
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,570
I didn't speak up for you, no need to thank me.

144
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,570


145
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:31,100
I just hate the one who bully the weak ones.

146
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:31,100


147
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,800
I'm thankfull that you vented out your anger.

148
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,800


149
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,570
I don't ever have courage to talk to my brothers like that.

150
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,570
subtitles ripped,synced and missing lines added by riri13

151
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,610
Time goes by so fast.

152
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,990
I suppose I've been here a long time too.

153
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,590
At first, I wondered if
I could even live here.

154
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,000
It wasn't so bad here.

155
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,500
But...

156
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,620
how long will I have
to live here as Hae Soo?

157
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:11,040
I wanted to tell you all of this
many times, Myung Hee.

158
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,820
I'm sorry about everything.

159
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,880
And thank you.

160
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,590
Hae Soo!

161
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,830
Sis! Hae Soo!

162
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,620
You're going to trip and fall.

163
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,150
Go get it!

164
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,850
Go get it...

165
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:36,870
Yeon Hwa.

166
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,090
Yeon Hwa.

167
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,680
Have you been well?

168
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,440
Where are you all coming from?

169
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,580
We went to visit our sister-in-law.

170
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,230
She must have been happy.

171
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:53,220
If I had told you earlier,
you could have told Myung Hee yourself.

172
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,470
I have good news for you.

173
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,730
You will be getting married.

174
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,240
Married?

175
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,520
Me?

176
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:11,310
You plan on marrying Soo off?

177
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,790
Ah, I see. It's just so sudden.

178
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,600
She's at the marrying age.
We can't just leave her be.

179
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,900
Thankfully we've found a
great person for her to marry.

180
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,780
For Soo, a marriage like this
will be hard to come by again.

181
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:36,270
Still, Lady Hae just passed away.

182
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,110
What do you mean marriage?

183
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,270
You should give her some space.

184
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,230
It is actually a good thing.

185
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,980
If she remains too long
where Myung Hee died

186
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,730
it won't be well for her
future marriage opportunities.

187
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,350
Your Highness, we hope you understand.

188
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,370
We cannot lose out on this opportunity.

189
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,360
Marriage? Is there anything so shocking?

190
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,620
It is true that she's
at the marrying age.

191
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,240
You're here now, so you
might as well oppose the marriage.

192
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,430
It's a Hae household affair.

193
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,060
We have no right to do that.

194
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,350
So! So, So.

195
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,690
Is it true that Hae Soo
is getting married?

196
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,970
Baek Ah, did you hear?

197
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,460
Eun heard somewhere.

198
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:23,850
The man she's marrying is an old man
who is over 60 with many, many sons.

199
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:27,410
Oh, that dummy.
Does she know what she's getting into?

200
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,580
If that is true, this is no marriage.
She's basically being sold.

201
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,520
Yes, she is being sold.

202
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,410
What did you just say?

203
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:37,920
Say it again.

204
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,070
What kind of home is Soo going to?

205
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,640
Wook, you're too much.

206
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,290
How could you treat Soo this way?

207
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,950
The man she's marrying made the offer

208
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,840
to make up for the
mistreatment of the Haes.

209
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,500
Selling Soo away like this
is dishonorable.

210
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,180
I need you all to help me.

211
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,650
Chae Ryung. I want to leave.

212
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,770
What?

213
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,330
How can I live with a man I've never met?

214
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:22,220
Myung Hee would never have
wanted me to marry in this way.

215
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,310
Give me that. I have to run.

216
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,720
Hurry, hurry.

217
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,860
Yes, go! Please go.

218
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,880
Even if I get beaten to death,
I won't tell them where you went, Lady.

219
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,920
Chae Ryung.

220
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,320
Soo! Hurry up and come out.

221
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,980
Hurry!

222
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,220
Will this be okay?

223
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,850
I can't send you away like this.

224
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,130
That was what he said.

225
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,150
Wook?

226
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,680
Follow them!

227
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,470
- Stop!
- Stop!

228
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,320
Stop, Wook.

229
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,660
You impudent thing.

230
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,550
You dare to stand
in the path of a prince!

231
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,480
- Wook.
- Oh, Yeon Hwa.

232
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,650
What is it?
Has something happened at home?

233
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,190
I apologize.

234
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:46,260
I believe that my niece has become
a burden to you, Your Highness.

235
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,700
Peek-a-boo!

236
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,230
Your niece was my brother?

237
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,730
Search the other paths. Now!

238
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:37,210
I didn't think you would
help me too, Prince So.

239
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,840
I just don't want to see you
live a life controlled by others.

240
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:46,280
It's really not worth living like that.

241
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,870
Hello to you, Your Highnesses.

242
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,260
What brings you out here,
and with the royal guards, at that?

243
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,300
Is that not Lady Soo from
the 8th Prince's home?

244
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,790
You will need to come with me.

245
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,020
Why do you need her?

246
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:53,280
Did the person who is to marry her
ask you for a favor?

247
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,610
Ji Mong.

248
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,030
Look the other way just this once.

249
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,930
How could she marry into
a household like that?

250
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,240
Don't you feel bad for her?

251
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,940
An order has been given for
Lady Soo to enter the palace.

252
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,070
What do you mean "enter the palace"?

253
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,210
It's not possible.

254
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,050
It has been confirmed that
the king will marry Lady Soo.

255
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,500
I have come to take her.

256
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,520
You must be mistaken.

257
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,430
It was sudden.

258
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:30,480
The daughter of the Hong Ha Jin Hae clan
and In Gyu Go Myung, Lady Soo

259
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,400
is definitely to be married to the king.

260
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,850
Have you heard anything?

261
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,530
No, not at all.

262
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,650
That's nonsense. Why would I...

263
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:42,340
Okay, then. Don't get off and wait.

264
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,150
4th Prince.

265
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,350
Astronomer Ji Mong.

266
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,610
Astronomer!

267
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,260
Your Highness.

268
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,600
What happened? Marriage to the king?

269
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,970
Oh, you heard about it.

270
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:10,930
The king has acknowledged
the Hae household's efforts.

271
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,630
He would like for us to be in-laws.

272
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:17,070
Why didn't you tell me
Soo was to marry the king?

273
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,620
Myung Hee is dead now.

274
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,240
We are no longer related to you.

275
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,530
Suppose Soo were to get pregnant
with the king's child.

276
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,700
You may have a breakdown in
relations due to the throne.

277
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,300
Were you afraid we would stop
the marriage if we knew about it?

278
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,490
We have nothing more to discuss.
Let us return.

279
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,490
Stand back.

280
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,280
Stand back.

281
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,760
You know what will happen if
you refuse a royal command.

282
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,240
Let her go, So.
How can you refuse a royal command?

283
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,160
All our brothers will die because of her.

284
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,200
I told you not to move.

285
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,770
I think I have to go.

286
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:26,520
If you leave now,
it will be hard to leave the palace.

287
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,570
I must go.

288
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,350
That's the only way no one gets hurt.

289
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,130
You really won't regret it?

290
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,630
Don't worry.

291
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:11,880
I'll go and try to talk to him.

292
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,640
Please sit in the palanquin.

293
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,110
Back to the palace!

294
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,110
That stupid girl.

295
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,270
An old man over 60 with many sons?

296
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,600
It was the king!

297
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,500
Where did you hear that?

298
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,810
Queen Dowager is here.

299
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,480
Such a busy person,

300
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,820
 is getting married now?

301
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,990
What is the hurry to set the date for the first night before the marriage?

302
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,370
Khitan is coming at us.

303
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:26,840
We have to combine power with Hong Ha Jin Hae housewold to protect the north board.

304
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,840
When will the powerfull household be satisfied the royal family?

305
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:37,080
The whole nation has no hope for Wang Mu and is digging his tomb.

306
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,380
Is that what you seek for his life?

307
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,320
I dug my own grave and my son's grave too!

308
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,590
You're still doubting me?

309
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,030
My Queen, you're a person who has everything.

310
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,030
I just doubt your greediness for it!

311
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,440
You pespective about me

312
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,110
I can't change it.

313
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,160
I'm not going to end up
marrying Taejo, am I?

314
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,240
No, it's not even right that
I'm living here in Goryeo.

315
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,170
Who knows what else could go wrong?

316
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,030
You need keep your head on straight.

317
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,910
Don't let yourself panic.

318
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:53,480
You have to get through this.
You have to survive.

319
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,570
[Damiwon Palace]

320
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:21,080
Switch the herbal pouch in one hour.

321
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:23,370
Royal Concubine Oh!

322
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,430
Astronomer Ji Mong has news
of the king's new bride.

323
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,530
When? And who is she?

324
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,940
The Damiwon was built to take care

325
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,020
of the mind and body
of the king and the princes.

326
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,420
You will prepare for the
marriage here, Lady Soo.

327
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,450
Excuse me.

328
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,560
I haven't heard anything
about this marriage at all.

329
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,680
I'm sorry to the king.

330
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,860
But can you inform him that I think
there has been some sort of mistake?

331
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,400
You want to turn down
a marriage to the king?

332
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,300
It's not just the king.
It would be the same for his grandfather.

333
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,400
I have no intention of marrying
a man I don't know.

334
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,670
Oh my, Royal Concubine Oh!

335
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:13,660
I wanted to see you for so long that
my eyes became this big all the time.

336
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,650
Is that her?

337
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,160
This is Lady Soo of
Hong Ha Jin Hae's household.

338
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:23,510
Now that you are here,
your subject will leave now.

339
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,270
Just follow your fate.

340
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,520
Astronomer.

341
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:39,260
From now on, do not refer to yourself
as a lower person in front of us.

342
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,290
Ah, that was...

343
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,670
Bring the lady.

344
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,000
Please come.

345
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,200
She's difficult... so difficult.

346
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,640
What did the king see
in a woman like that?

347
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,490
We will search your body briefly
before you wash up.

348
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,630
Why?

349
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:21,310
A woman with scars on her body
cannot be the king's wife.

350
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,590
So you must be examined.

351
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,950
I don't want to be.

352
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,300
I don't have scars.

353
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:32,290
I don't like people looking at me.
I never even go to public baths.

354
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,870
So how can you tell me to undress?

355
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:36,490
Oh! What are you doing?
What are you doing?

356
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:39,480
- Hold on!
- You will be sharing a room tonight.

357
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,740
It will not take long,
so forgive me for the lack of courtesy.

358
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,090
Sharing a room? Wait, just wait!

359
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:47,360
What are you doing? I told you to stop!

360
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,480
Wait!

361
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:53,730
I'm sure you heard about
the king's marriage.

362
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,550
Will you not stop him?

363
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:00,140
He's doing it for national interests.
Is it something I should speak up about?

364
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:04,570
You always carry around your Buddhist
prayer beads and now you're like a saint.

365
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,050
His Majesty already has 29 concubines.

366
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:09,940
He should consider his family
before he considers national interests.

367
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:14,260
Is he planning on splitting the nation
into 25 parts once he passes away?

368
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,710
Why would you say such a thing?

369
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,250
The 14th Prince is here.

370
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,760
Tell him to come in.

371
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:27,390
The 14th Prince greets you,
Queen Hwangbo.

372
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,590
Come in.

373
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,320
Help me, Mother.

374
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,970
You know Soo from
my eighth brother's home?

375
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,020
Hae Soo is marrying the king.
Please stop it.

376
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,800
She was the one he is marrying?

377
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:47,130
You seemed relaxed about it.
Was it because you're related to her?

378
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,000
Who can stop the king's marriage?

379
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,890
It's not your place to step in.

380
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:58,600
It's her household forcing it on her.
Soo does not wish to marry.

381
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,090
Mother...

382
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,680
The 8th Prince is here.

383
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:19,690
The 8th Prince greets you, Queen Yoo.

384
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,320
Why brings you by unexpectedly?

385
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,980
- Well...
- You're here about Hae Soo too, right?

386
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,930
You see? This is a big problem.

387
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,120
You have to resolve this, Mother.

388
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,060
I know you can do it.

389
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,570
Wook.

390
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:42,220
Does this marriage truly bother you?

391
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,480
Why?

392
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:50,340
To me, she is like a younger sister.

393
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,410
It is also very sudden.

394
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,810
- Also--
- She is the cousin of his dead wife.

395
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:57,780
Of course he would be conflicted.

396
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,160
It's a marriage to the king.

397
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,200
I wonder why you would be so conflicted.

398
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,730
Your Highness!

399
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,880
Come on.

400
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,670
You have to find a way to get Soo out!

401
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:32,690
She came in on her own.
Let her endure it on her own.

402
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:36,030
If she had persisted and stayed,
we would have all died.

403
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:39,540
Whatever the case,
she should have run if she chose to.

404
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:43,140
- No one can stop it now.
- So!

405
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:50,470
Do you, by chance, have feelings for her?

406
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,100
Is this why you're doing this?

407
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,110
It's not me who does.

408
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:00,160
Anyway, she is a bit special to me.

409
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,270
It was after Myung Hee died,
and we were drinking together every day.

410
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:11,770
If you liked Myung Hee so much,
why couldn't you tell her even once?

411
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,630
Well...

412
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:20,150
Well, my mother...

413
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,700
She is a Shilla royal family member,
which is now fallen.

414
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:27,730
We may all be princes,
but we're not at the same level.

415
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:32,130
Back then, my family
had a high standing.

416
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,630
I was not in a position to be
able to ask for Myung Hee.

417
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,540
Ah, there you go again!

418
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:41,120
Please stop talking about
taking people or whatever.

419
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,650
This place always treats people
like they are property.

420
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,940
Just wait a thousand years.

421
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,140
There is no one above any other person.

422
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,640
There is no one below you.

423
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,020
Prince? Psh.

424
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,800
Be careful with what you're saying.

425
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,210
How long is life anyway?

426
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,870
- You're always going on and on...
- Be quiet.

427
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:04,350
Your status is this,
and this prince is that.

428
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,720
Gosh.

429
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,880
Baek Ah... look here.

430
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:15,890
You could be living well,
and still just end up dying one day.

431
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:18,730
You can fall right out of the sky

432
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,970
then end up living in a place like this.

433
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:27,540
So, just follow your heart and live.

434
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,080
Do everything you want to do
and live however you want.

435
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,140
However!

436
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,150
Okay?

437
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,600
Okay?

438
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:42,900
Okay.

439
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:46,970
She spoke recklessly like that
and you just listened?

440
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:48,330
She didn't say anything wrong.

441
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:51,260
Look around Goryeo.
Family connections are everything.

442
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,600
You only get treated well if you're born
from a good family and good-looking.

443
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,510
You only get recognition
if you marry well.

444
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,800
It's this bad for us, and we are princes.

445
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,960
How bad is it for the people?

446
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,000
So, what?

447
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,310
Do you want to overthrow the throne?

448
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:07,120
Are you going to change this nation?

449
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,290
I only want to be free.

450
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:14,250
That's what you want too.
What about Hae Soo?

451
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:17,240
How can a girl with no parents
or siblings survive in this place?

452
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,780
Once today passes...

453
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,810
she will never even see the king.

454
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:28,540
She will suffocate and die like this.

455
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:47,850
We are finished examining you.
You may wash up now.

456
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,740
I want to be alone.

457
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,690
You will marry once the sun sets.

458
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:55,700
The king is waiting, so now--

459
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,180
Let go of me!

460
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,370
Even this morning,
I didn't know this would happen to me.

461
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,260
I need time to figure out
what is happening.

462
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,630
Wait here a moment.
I will check on the bath.

463
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,210
Marriage?

464
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,120
Sharing a room?

465
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,390
I have to leave, but to where?

466
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,810
Ah, that secret tunnel!

467
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,030
I'm sure the entrance is here.

468
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,350
Are you happy?

469
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:24,150
My father forced a marriage!

470
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,520
Crowd Prince, please save me.

471
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,810
You said that before, right?

472
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,440
A rabbit always dig two holes.

473
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,900
While the silly man guards the front hole,

474
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,670
the rabbit escape through the back hole.

475
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:43,040
The Choi Ji Mong I know, never have just one way out!

476
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,310
He'll have at least two or more!

477
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,380
Tell me about the other way out!

478
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,880
Your Majesty.

479
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,610
Hong Ha Jin Hae's household has
handed over their daughter, Soo.

480
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,210
She is ready for the marriage.

481
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,640
Did you say Soo?

482
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,960
Is she the cousin of my 8th son's wife,
who passed away?

483
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,430
Yes, she is.

484
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:26,600
Why did it have to be that girl?

485
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,820
Those people are full of greed.

486
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,030
Would you like to stop the marriage?

487
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,990
It will too cumbersome to do so

488
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,670
and where will I find
another suitable girl?

489
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,840
It is fine, so let's go.

490
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,230
Isn't that you, Wook?

491
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:26,870
I have dared to come and discuss
a matter with you, Your Majesty.

492
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:34,780
An intelligent boy like you
is blocking my path?

493
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:41,530
The royal family already
has many in-laws.

494
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:44,530
The other powerful families are trying
to keep the royal family in check.

495
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:50,910
I am curious to know why you
need to bring in another household.

496
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,880
I have very good justification.

497
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:57,810
I need the help of the Haes in order to
stop a war from breaking out with Khitan.

498
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:03,060
As for you, what is your reason
for stopping this marriage?

499
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,840
That is...

500
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,940
What if you did not have
to use this method?

501
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,860
What do you all think you're doing?

502
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,040
Your Majesty.

503
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,720
Please hear us and stop this marriage.

504
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:34,720
You must not care about your lives!

505
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:39,750
I have found a witness who saw
Hong Ha Jin Hae conspiring with Khitan.

506
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,760
You should punish the Haes.

507
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,190
Leave the border to another family.

508
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:49,780
You could let the Haes be
magistrate of their town.

509
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,350
Reconciliation is possible, as well.

510
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,880
You do not need marriage.

511
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,170
There are other ways to
cut down the Haes' strength.

512
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,660
Must you offer to make them your in-laws?

513
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,100
Minister.

514
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,590
Yes, Your Majesty.

515
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,650
I will proceed with the marriage.

516
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:07,950
Yes, Your Majesty.

517
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:12,030
If I punish the Haes for conspiracy
like you suggest

518
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:16,230
it will take half a day to send the army
and the borders will be breached.

519
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,860
If I tried to teach the Haes a lesson...

520
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:23,690
would you not fear the actions
of the other powerful families?

521
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:31,180
In the palace, it is not right
to look for a reason to act.

522
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:34,550
You must look for a good excuse
to stop it from happening.

523
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:37,220
Do you understand?

524
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,920
Your reason...

525
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:42,860
is not good enough.

526
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,880
Soo.

527
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,170
That reason...

528
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:17,630
I will give it to you.

529
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,890
What?

530
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:27,130
My body... if there is a scar...

531
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,230
I cannot become a king's wife.

532
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:37,910
So, Your Majesty, please stop.

533
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,980
Let me go now.

534
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,360
You are more courageous than a man.

535
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:12,190
Bring in Hong Ha Jin Hae.

536
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,810
Yes, Your Majesty.

537
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,170
Soo!

538
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:24,370
Soo!

539
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,280
Soo...

540
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:39,930
Soo!

541
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:42,180
- Soo!
- Sis, Sis!

542
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,770
Call a doctor!

543
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,860
Hurry.

544
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,260
Soo! Hurry.

545
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,270
Are you okay?

546
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,430
Where am I?

547
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:14,930
Right, I died... but I didn't.

548
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,750
Goryeo... Taejo Wang Geon.

549
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:20,970
Gwangjong?

550
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:24,450
Something about Gwangjong
is bothering me.

551
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:27,450
I'm forgetting something.

552
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:32,800
Goryeo's fourth king, Gwangjong.

553
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,780
Yes, Gwangjong is the fourth king.

554
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:39,990
He was a king who killed
his brothers and his subjects.

555
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:42,330
Goryeo's fourth King, Gwangjong.

556
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,100
Who is it?

557
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,510
Which one of the princes is it?

558
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:48,680
Could it possibly be...

559
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:01,530
It's not.

560
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,610
That's right.

561
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,910
You have not died and you are alive.

562
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:10,730
You're still unmarried.

563
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:13,140
So I watched over you
instead of a doctor.

564
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,790
This is the palace, right?

565
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:26,430
You haven't died yet,
so you are still in the palace.

566
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:33,560
Are you saying that I can't
leave this place unless I die?

567
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:40,130
The doctor says the wound is deep
and you will have a scar.

568
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:45,190
I expected it.

569
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,550
Did you hate the idea of being
the king's wife that much?

570
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:53,160
You would've had all the wealth
and prosperity you could wish for.

571
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:59,560
No matter how I live,
I'm going to have the right to choose.

572
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,950
That's what people think
when they are young.

573
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:10,420
You will be punished soon.

574
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:12,730
You should prepare yourself for that.

575
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,590
I don't regret it.

576
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:19,530
I protected what I wanted.

577
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,670
I should pay for it.

578
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:31,730
Then rest up.

579
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:51,550
Everything will be all right now.

580
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:55,260
It's all over now.

581
00:47:58,570 --> 00:47:59,770
The king...

582
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:04,270
Because...

583
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:14,200
Because of the scar of your body,
he has canceled the marriage.

584
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:18,890
The Hae household...

585
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:24,310
It's been determined that they've
gone against national interests.

586
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,960
Your household will not
pressure you anymore.

587
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:41,520
Last night...

588
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:45,810
I felt so pathetic.

589
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:50,210
And pathetic.

590
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:57,310
And pathetic, yet again.

591
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:03,830
I thought to myself
that I was a bad person.

592
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,080
Yet, I prayed to my dead wife.

593
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,850
I said if you were returned to me...

594
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:22,330
I would pay her back by giving you
the affection I could never give her.

595
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:26,670
I asked her for forgiveness
and to send you to me.

596
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:30,110
I begged her.

597
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,500
If you had become the king's woman...

598
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:43,910
I would never have forgiven myself.

599
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:48,610
I thought...

600
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,030
I would never see you again.

601
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:00,000
I never got to say goodbye to you.

602
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:06,410
I didn't think it was right
to part like that.

603
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:08,770
So...

604
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:22,850
This will not happen again.

605
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:25,480
I lost you once.

606
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:30,420
I won't let that happen again, so...

607
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:35,350
it's all right.

608
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:40,050
Everything will be all right, Soo.

609
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:45,830
It's all right.

610
00:50:56,430 --> 00:51:00,390
Your Majesty, the stars are gone
and the sun is about to rise.

611
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:04,200
You need to get some sleep
in order to preserve the throne.

612
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,530
All right.

613
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:10,170
Your Majesty.

614
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:13,020
Have you determined what to do
about Soo of the Hae household?

615
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:21,570
Though I do feel bad for her,
I can't ignore that she disobeyed orders.

616
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:25,550
Send her to be a slave.

617
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,950
Why don't we let her live
as a court lady in the palace?

618
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:32,620
Both Queen Yoo and
Queen Hwangbo need one.

619
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:37,160
Even Lady Gwangjuwon asked for Hae Soo.

620
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,700
I'm sure the children asked for it.

621
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:43,860
What is her relationship
to the princes, anyhow?

622
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,610
The 8th and 4th even got involved.

623
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,960
I do not want to cause any more trouble.

624
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,630
But...

625
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:57,620
Royal Concubine Oh of Damiwon Palace
put in a request, as well.

626
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:02,690
Damiwon?

627
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:06,580
I have heard that Hae Soo has a lot of
interest in makeup and herbal medicine.

628
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:07,870
They say she knows a lot.

629
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:10,390
I believe she would be a
great benefit to the royal family

630
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:11,750
if we left her with Concubine Oh.

631
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,360
Where is she now?

632
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:08,450
I would like to go see Myung Hee.

633
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:11,700
Yes, let's go together.

634
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,070
She did ask me to look after you.

635
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:17,970
If we go together,
I know it will make her happy.

636
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:53,120
It's enough to cancel the wedding.

637
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,970
Why must she be a court lady, right?

638
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:58,520
Still, isn't it a relief that
she avoided punishment?

639
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,730
She could have become a slave.

640
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:02,120
Yes.

641
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,170
I had nowhere to go, anyway.

642
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:05,880
I heard court ladies get paid.

643
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,150
It's a good thing I can support myself.

644
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:09,610
That's right.

645
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:13,390
You're a noble lady so you will be
treated differently even as a court lady.

646
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:17,200
If you work very hard,
the king may let you marry.

647
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,450
He will let you out on trips too,
so work hard.

648
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:21,420
Trips? Really?

649
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,920
Yes.

650
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:26,130
Lady Soo. Should we get going?

651
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:36,410
I think it may be difficult to go see
Myung Hee for the time being.

652
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:41,920
Like Choi Ji Mong said

653
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,830
it's a relief that
you avoided punishment.

654
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:48,080
Do not worry too much.

655
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,550
I'm not worried.

656
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:54,410
There's nothing I can't do,
and I'm smart.

657
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:56,440
So, I'm a fast learner.

658
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,820
I'll become someone who is needed.

659
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:02,080
You know that.

660
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:42,890
I will visit you every day.

661
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:52,110
Soo!

662
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:54,770
- Sis!
- Soo!

663
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,720
Soo, Soo!

664
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,460
Move, would you?

665
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,450
Soo, I thought you had died.

666
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:09,490
You understand why I did that before?

0666
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:14,990
It's a misunderstanding.

667
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:20,220
Stop making people worry.

668
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:22,250
How could you do that to your body?

669
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:25,100
That's enough now.

670
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:28,550
If you wear her down on her first day,
Concubine Oh will not be happy.

671
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:30,100
Yes, she won't be.

672
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,470
Concubine Oh is really scary.

673
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:33,630
I will visit often, so don't worry.

674
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:36,260
It's one out of these two or three.

675
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:38,180
The next king is here.

676
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:40,700
Who is it?

677
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:44,140
Who's going to become Gwangjong
and kill his brothers?

678
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:48,090
No! That can't happen.

679
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,920
It can't be...

680
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:06,400
Your life is quite something.

681
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,560
How many times have you almost died?

682
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:11,330
Next time, you will definitely die--

683
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:12,490
Stop!

684
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,900
Stop!

685
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,190
Come on, Lady Soo.

686
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:19,360
You must go alone from here on.

687
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,100
Royal Concubine Oh will be waiting.

688
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,090
Soo, go get it!

689
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:45,220
There's no need to be afraid.
You know that, right?

690
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:54,880
Soo!

691
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:28,400
