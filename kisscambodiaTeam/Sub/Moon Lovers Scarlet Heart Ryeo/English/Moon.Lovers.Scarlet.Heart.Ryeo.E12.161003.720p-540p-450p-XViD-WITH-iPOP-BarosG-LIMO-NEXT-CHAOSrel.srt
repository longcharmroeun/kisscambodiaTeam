<i>[Episode 12]</i>
Find out how strong their forces are.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,090
It will be very dangerous.

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,730
I will do as you command.

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,740
You will not protest?

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,670
It is your command. How could I refuse?

10
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,040
I will leave Songak
as you have commanded.

11
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,690
However, Hae Soo has nowhere to go
except the Damiwon.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,330
Please have mercy and be understanding.

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,440
Are you still taking her side?

14
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,350
She is not someone I can throw away.

15
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,930
I will work hard as an ambassador to Jin.

16
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,160
Get rid of Hae Soo.

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,740
Pardon me?

18
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,620
Send her away to a place where
the princes will be unable to meet her.

19
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:34,660
If he cannot throw her away himself,
his father will have to do it for him.

20
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,880
She had the dignity of a queen.

21
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,040
However, she was not born
under the star of a queen.

22
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,500
Is that good luck or bad luck?

23
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,560
I asked the obvious.

24
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,840
She left this place after
meeting someone like me.

25
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,440
It is the worst luck.

26
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,390
She left without grudges or bitterness.

27
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,110
So, she was very lucky.

28
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,410
You should believe that.

29
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,850
You must leave the Damiwon.

30
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,140
You've been instructed not to say goodbye
to the princes or get involved with them.

31
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,960
Where must I go?

32
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,410
Where must I go in order
to never see them again?

33
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,000
How are you feeling?

34
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,460
No matter how much my heart may ache,

35
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,131
this world doesn't stop its course.

36
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:38,168
I suppose if I keep watching its busy course,

37
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,060
I may come to forget everything some day.

38
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,130
Forget it quickly if you can.

39
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,800
The more difficult things are,
the better it is to work hard to forget.

40
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,590
You too, Your Highness.

41
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,360
You should forget me now.

42
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,900
Do not say such things.

43
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,490
Stay put and wait for me
at the Damiwon until I return.

44
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,090
I will not wait.

45
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,400
This happened to you
because you tried to help me.

46
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,540
I remember how happy you were
because you got to live in the palace.

47
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,440
You don't want to leave,
but you have to.

48
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,580
It is all my fault.

49
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:52,670
Now, please... learn to differentiate
between friendship and love.

50
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,180
If you give all your affection
to one person

51
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,480
it will make things harder for you.

52
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,200
It is you who might run into bad luck
if you get involved with me.

53
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,960
Because it happens
to everyone who does.

54
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,530
I still won't let you go.

55
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,120
Because with this face,
all they can do is curse it, anyway.

56
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,790
Dummy.

57
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,480
I said I would get your permission.

58
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,560
I lied.

59
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,390
I'll borrow this for good luck.

60
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,080
I'll be back soon.

61
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,690
<i>I will not be waiting.</i>

62
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,750
<i>Though you risked your life for me...</i>

63
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,310
<i>Though you called me your person...</i>

64
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,060
<i>I cannot do it.</i>

65
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,790
<i>I become afraid every time we meet.</i>

66
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,540
<i>I know that I had feelings for another.</i>

67
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,190
<i>So why is it that I can't
let you go and ignore you?</i>

68
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,100
<i>[Hae Soo]</i>

69
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,040
Wook!

70
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,360
Soo is gone.

71
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,080
She's not in the Damiwon.

72
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,010
You don't think she's
been kicked out, do you?

73
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,730
S... Soo?

74
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,630
Soo, no...

75
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:14,028
You can't just vanish like this...

76
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,180
Soo!

77
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,280
There was a person
who was a pesky creature

78
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,110
and she has lost her life.

79
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,920
Was it your doing?

80
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,080
I'm sure you wanted to
get rid of her too, Your Majesty.

81
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,150
When I see you like this,
you seem like a daughter I bore myself.

82
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,660
You and I, we will get along very well.

83
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,820
That will not happen.

84
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,840
I just remembered.

85
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,590
My mother was accused of
causing the miscarriage

86
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,930
of a court lady the king loved.

87
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,150
My mother was exiled for it.

88
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,640
That was Court Lady Oh.

89
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:48,820
It is you, Your Majesty, who killed
the woman that the king loves most.

90
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,120
I cannot become close to you

91
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,490
who could be caught and
kicked out at any moment.

92
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,780
You should get it straight.

93
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,760
You are in the same boat.

94
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,990
I drank the poison by my own hands.
Who would doubt me?

95
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,890
Anyone who knows the truth
or abetted in the act are all gone now.

96
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,920
You are alone now, Your Majesty.

97
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,040
Do not make my mother
get on her knees ever again.

98
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,530
Protect yourself well.

99
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,200
Yeon Hwa is different.

100
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,850
Do you see why I can't help but like her?

101
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,180
She is dangerous.

102
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,610
She has more ambition than any man.

103
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,210
Keep your distance from her.

104
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,250
That's what makes her fun, though.

105
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,810
Did you meet with your uncle,
Wang Shik Ryeom?

106
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:20,400
Uncle has agreed to support me
whenever I need it.

107
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,160
You will become a Queen Mother now.

108
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,610
He wouldn't help without
getting anything in return.

109
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,460
What does he want?

110
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,960
To make Seokyeong the capital city.
(present day Pyongyang)

111
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:48,040
<i>[One year later (Taejo Year 26)]</i>

112
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,320
Families from rural cities
who don't ever come to the palace?

113
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,060
Is something going on?

114
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,600
The king has 10 instructions
to give before he is to die.

115
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,110
It could be the second son rather than
the first who takes the throne.

116
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,210
Many believe the king may choose me.

117
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,690
I don't believe it.

118
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,160
What have you been doing?

119
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,250
I heard that you have been
getting rid of the pirates.

120
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,660
Why haven't you visited Mother?

121
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,120
She is hurt.

122
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,070
I am living just fine, so don't worry.

123
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,780
Mother has you, doesn't she?

124
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,490
Listen to the way you're talking.

125
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,670
Wook, he has changed since
he's been hanging around you.

126
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,074
Now that anybody can succeed the throne,

127
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:56,011
all my brothers are after me. 

128
00:14:56,712 --> 00:15:00,683
His Majesty has pushed me into the tiger's mouth. 

129
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:03,200
His Majesty intends to use the 10 Instructions

130
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,780
to see who is on your side, Crown Prince.

131
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,623
I'm afraid that in the process,

132
00:15:08,057 --> 00:15:11,193
my loved ones will get hurt.

133
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,430
You got it wrong!

134
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,720
You got it wrong again. Wrong again.

135
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,020
Why would you point the knife there?
You should wind it in.

136
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,610
You always get it wrong
in the same place.

137
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,290
You'll embarrass yourself
at the peace gathering.

138
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,910
- Let's try one more time.
- No.

139
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,920
What?

140
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,840
There's a limit to how much
you can overwork a person.

141
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,830
Look, look, look.

142
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,350
Do you see how swollen my lips are
from helping you?

143
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
My lady has prepared me food
and she is waiting.

144
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,890
I have to go.

145
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,150
You're married?

146
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,290
Why?

147
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,450
Does it bother you that I'm married?

148
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,070
Why would it bother me?

149
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,410
What's it to me?

150
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,690
Have you been married a long time?

151
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,770
Do you have children too?

152
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,510
Let me see.

153
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:48,330
It's been over 20 years
and there is a great son, too.

154
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,600
- What?
- There is a wife.

155
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,660
It's my father's wife.

156
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,960
My mother is waiting,
so I must get going.

157
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,300
Were you playing a joke on me?
Have you no fear?

158
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,260
You're the one who got fooled.
You got fooled.

159
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,030
It's good to practice and all,
but don't get hurt.

160
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,650
Okay?

161
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,470
- O...
- Okay.

162
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,860
Works of Mencius?

163
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,820
Are you testing your husband?

164
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,620
I'm willing to bet my wrist
that I read it all.

165
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,730
This wrist is mine.

166
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:41,930
Next!

167
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,030
Take it. Take it all!

168
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,470
My arm, leg, and throat. Take it all!

169
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,690
Next.

170
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,080
You can't have this.

171
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,190
This belongs to Hae Soo.

172
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,190
You're not crying, are you?

173
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,810
Father!

174
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:42,250
Wow, my daughter is still alive and well.

175
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:47,060
Why do you look like crap
someone has chewed and spat out?

176
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,680
Why are you stuck on that desk?

177
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,550
What would you have done if
His Highness had been shocked to death?

178
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,780
If that were enough to shock him,
how would he live in this harsh world?

179
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,600
Were you hurt? Should I blow on it?

180
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,910
Once I get on the throne

181
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:19,190
I will divorce my wife
and make you queen.

182
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:23,280
Your current wife's father is
the Minister of the Left Park Young Gyu.

183
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,120
You expect me to believe the lie that
you will get rid of a close associate?

184
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,000
Park Young Gyu is originally
from Later Baekje.

185
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,720
I will need that support
before I become king.

186
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,510
After, he will be a bother.

187
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,790
I know how to find weaknesses in people.

188
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,390
You can recognize darkness immediately.

189
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:05,250
Don't you see that we are
a match made in heaven?

190
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,790
You are visiting often.
I'm worried people will start to talk.

191
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,600
As for you and I, do not forget
that we are complete opposites.

192
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,670
Don't worry.

193
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:34,840
It was not you I came to see.
I came for Yeon Hwa.

194
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,380
We have cause now because of the
10 instructions the king will leave us.

195
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,450
How about we attack the king now
instead of waiting on it?

196
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,630
It will be troublesome if the
Crown Prince ends up on the throne.

197
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,600
Still, I will not do
something so immoral.

198
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,030
How can a child kill his own parent?

199
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,470
A father is willing to kill his child.

200
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,630
Why can't a child do it?

201
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,600
I am only joking... joking.

202
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,700
Do not forget your promise to support me
and not the Crown Prince.

203
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,210
Of course.

204
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,780
I do not understand you, Wook.

205
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,700
Why wouldn't you take
the throne yourself?

206
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,060
Why are you acting as our
third brother's shadow?

207
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,600
If you push the Crown Prince out now

208
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,950
you will be a traitor,
even while on the throne.

209
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:46,900
However, a traitor who kills a traitor...

210
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,070
becomes a hero.

211
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,200
It is far better to be in
Yo's shadow right now.

212
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,030
A very loyal shadow.

213
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,880
What if our third brother
ends up betraying you?

214
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,780
You can help me.

215
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:06,940
What?

216
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,480
That ring...

217
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,770
it suits you very well, Yeon Hwa.

218
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,130
Are you telling me to become a hostage?

219
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,120
Colleague, collateral...

220
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,560
Use a term that makes you feel better.

221
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,930
We are heavily indebted
to one another, are we not?

222
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,160
You should risk that much.

223
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,270
I like the 8th Prince best.

224
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:50,470
They say the 14th Prince cut the pirate's
throat like he was cutting a flower.

225
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:55,050
The king made him a general
and favors him.

226
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,620
He could become a king.

227
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,850
Really?

228
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,560
What about the 8th Prince?

229
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,570
I heard that the king
was close to the 8th Prince.

230
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:08,520
I heard all the powerful families with
daughters put in requests to marry him.

231
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:17,310
Hae Soo! You were at the Damiwon,
so you must've seen the princes.

232
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,240
Which one is the best?

233
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,850
Who's the best, huh?

234
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,610
Hey, can't you hear me?

235
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,590
Can you not hear?

236
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,970
It's best not to talk about the princes.

237
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,650
It's easy to get into trouble.

238
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:38,300
So, you're saying water maids like us
shouldn't even mention them?

239
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:42,120
You got kicked out of there.
Don't act like you're better than us.

240
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,560
I'm just saying, be careful what you say.

241
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,010
Oh my, oh my, oh my.

242
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:51,250
She won't even let us
bring up the princes.

243
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,970
How funny of her.

244
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:58,340
I told her to draw the 4th Prince's face
and she ripped up the paper.

245
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,710
I suppose we should just
rinse the laundry.

246
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,760
Goodness. Gosh!

247
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,090
Hey, who are you glaring at?

248
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,050
Who do you think you are?
You little thing.

249
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,320
Oh my gosh.

250
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,370
I told you to stop.

251
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,090
I heard that you
caused your superior to die.

252
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,530
I know all about how Court Lady Oh
from the Damiwon died because of you.

253
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:48,200
You unlucky wench.

254
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,330
Everyone says that getting mixed up
with you leads to bad things.

255
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,740
She's bad luck.

256
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,480
Must feel good.

257
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,850
That must feel good.

258
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,230
Wook!

259
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,690
- Good job.
- I'm so tired.

260
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,460
That was hard work.

261
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,680
Wook.

262
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,050
I didn't recognize that path.

263
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,570
Were you trying to show her to me?

264
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,850
It's already been a year.

265
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,120
Are you really going to
leave her like that?

266
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,390
She's a Gyobang water maid.

267
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,010
It the lowest place in the palace.

268
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,970
Why should I care?

269
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,360
I know everything.

270
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:12,680
You loved Soo.

271
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,400
There's another reason, right?

272
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,610
Otherwise, you wouldn't act this way.

273
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,390
I can't die too.

274
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,570
It was the king who kicked Hae Soo out.

275
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,440
You cannot go against the king.

276
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,510
You should be careful as well.

277
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,770
Don't forget that you can be thrown
out of the palace for one mistake.

278
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:48,120
Is your leg still unwell?

279
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,510
I heard Jung sent you medicine.

280
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,680
Only when I work too long
or I am by the water.

281
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,390
I'm all right.

282
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,580
Are you upset with me?

283
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:08,510
Do you... hate me?

284
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,600
I could not promise you anything.
That is why I could not come.

285
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,320
Because I've become so useless...

286
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,130
Because I cannot do anything for you...

287
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,400
I cannot get you back
because the king's anger

288
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,780
was too great over Court Lady Oh.

289
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,370
I cannot dare to bring up marriage.

290
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:45,060
Did you miss me?

291
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,670
Even once?

292
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:59,880
Did you ever miss me?

293
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,860
Every day.

294
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,890
I longed for you every moment.

295
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,020
That is all I need, then.

296
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,740
That's enough.

297
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,440
The situation will get better now.

298
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,070
So, once I get more power--

299
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,020
Don't overextend yourself on my behalf.

300
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,510
Don't put yourself in danger.

301
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,860
I have seen enough of that.

302
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,390
Please don't get hurt.

303
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,200
Don't make me feel more sorry than I do.

304
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,170
What is the situation like in Later Jin?

305
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:56,240
Gaozu has died and his nephew,
Yonghe, is leading now.

306
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,970
It seems like they'll be
going to war with Khitan

307
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,870
over a territorial dispute soon.

308
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,800
There are many conflicts over the
succession of the throne.

309
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,700
I do not think they will succeed.

310
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:09,360
That means Khitan will be
starting to dominate.

311
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,890
Then, I want you to visit
Khitan this time.

312
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:14,090
I do not want to.

313
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,910
Do not want to?

314
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,220
You broke the promise
you made to me when I left.

315
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,620
I cannot comply either.

316
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,400
You still have feelings for that girl?

317
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,810
A king must be able to throw anyone away

318
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,710
for the sake of his family
or this nation!

319
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:32,180
You should thank me for
throwing her out for you!

320
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:35,570
I am not the king nor will I become one.

321
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,330
If you want to keep even one more ally
for the Crown Prince

322
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,100
do not tie a noose around my neck.
subtitles ripped,synced and added the missing lines by riri13

323
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:46,250
I, too, will live like a person now.

324
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,690
You...

325
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,240
Your Majesty.

326
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:06,440
Children all think they were raised on
their own and act out of turn like that.

327
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,960
Do not worry about it too much.

328
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,550
You will get sick over it.

329
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:18,010
He should've come at me
like that to begin with.

330
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,620
Excuse me?

331
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,500
Now he will not lose
no matter who he fights.

332
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:29,370
He has to be at that level in order
for me to close my eyes in peace.

333
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:35,890
Your Majesty, your star is still bright.
Why would you say such a thing?

334
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:41,430
There are times you know yourself
better than the heavens know you.

335
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,840
You should all prepare yourselves.

336
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,230
You never did listen.

337
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,270
I told you to stay put at the Damiwon.

338
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:11,110
Doing physical labor suited you better
than being a court lady, anyway.

339
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,780
I missed you.

340
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:32,330
You should not be here.

341
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:35,740
Pretend you didn't see me.

342
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,330
Just as always...

343
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,210
you are beautiful.

344
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,460
Why?

345
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,560
Why have you covered it again?

346
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,630
Have you forgotten how to
prepare the makeup?

347
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,210
Has your scar gotten more prominent?

348
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,060
You hated it so much,
so why would you let it....

349
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,200
I didn't take it off
so I wouldn't forget you.

350
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,940
I was determined to
come back and see you.

351
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,430
I am not a Damiwon court lady,
but a Gyobang water maid.

352
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:44,230
I'm not at a level where
I can meet you, Your Highness.

353
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,780
You have returned safe and sound.

354
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,990
You know that I am doing well.

355
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,780
That's good enough.

356
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,960
- Soo.
- Please go.

357
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,490
This isn't where you should be. Let's go.

358
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,230
I'll resolve this somehow.

359
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,040
Just leave me alone!

360
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:22,230
I am only here like this
because I can neither die nor live.

361
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,880
Whether it's Court Lady Oh,
who died because of me

362
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,040
or the scary life in the palace
waiting around every corner

363
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,920
I can forget all of it
if my body grows weary.

364
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,677
<i>You must stop caring about me.</i>

365
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,790
I will watch over you
just like when you helped me.

366
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:43,710
I will help you forget it all
even without living this hard life.

367
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:46,740
<i>Please, don't abandon who you are for me.</i>

368
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,190
Even if the person
I want to avoid most...

369
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,140
is you, Your Highness?

370
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:59,060
When I meet you,
I recall everything I want to forget.

371
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:06,950
Go back.

372
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:12,120
I'm living just fine. I can survive.

373
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,580
Your Highness...

374
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,490
Please live in peace.

375
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:22,380
Do not hate or hold grudges.
Forget everything.

376
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,020
Then no one will get hurt.

377
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,750
Do not worry about it.

378
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,630
I know my condition well.

379
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,010
It's a new tea from the Damiwon.

380
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,080
Nothing appeals to me
and I don't want anything.

381
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,390
A new court lady made a new mixture.

382
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,680
At least try smelling the fragrance.

383
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,920
Did that girl make it?

384
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:10,170
I only wanted to bring
your appetite back.

385
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,750
I apologize, Your Majesty.

386
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,560
Bring her to me.

387
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:40,250
I want you to marry me.

388
00:39:43,998 --> 00:39:47,501
I don't think I heard you right. 

389
00:39:48,169 --> 00:39:51,505
You want what with me? 

390
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,410
I've been thinking about what kind of a person I am.

391
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:56,777
Although I was born as a princess

392
00:39:56,777 --> 00:39:59,814
and received undeserved love from the king and the princes,

393
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,616
I was always missing something.

394
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,152
I was never satisfied.

395
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,120
When my whole household was on exile, I finally realized.

396
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,325
I need power.

397
00:40:11,525 --> 00:40:14,829
The only thing that can fulfill my insatiable hunger is...

398
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,064
the throne.

399
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,940
I'm not that kind of person.

400
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:29,240
I'm the opposite of the
kind of person you want.

401
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:33,160
Yes, I know.
That's why I kept my distance.

402
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,790
However...

403
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,720
there was something I did not know.

404
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,550
I am a girl too.

405
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,820
I have loved you for a long time.

406
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:58,000
I am destined to be with you.

407
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,089
When I was little,

408
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:19,727
somebody said that I had the star of a king.

409
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,962
That same day,

410
00:41:21,962 --> 00:41:24,665
I got this scar on my face.

411
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:27,833
I didn't even get treated as a prince,

412
00:41:28,102 --> 00:41:30,571
much less king.

413
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:34,275
Your predestined one?

414
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,742
 I don't believe in such a thing as fate.

415
00:41:39,013 --> 00:41:40,381
Besides,

416
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,983
there's someone else I have in mind. 

417
00:41:47,988 --> 00:41:51,492
 Is it... Hae Soo?

418
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,163
She brings bad luck.

419
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,165
She'll hinder your future! 

420
00:41:58,165 --> 00:41:59,934
Without Soo,

421
00:42:00,835 --> 00:42:03,300
there would have been no future for me at all.

422
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,005
Now that I've said that,

423
00:42:07,675 --> 00:42:09,510
it's become clear now.

424
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:16,617
I am nothing without her.

425
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:03,060
<i>The way he looks... it reminds
me of how Grandpa looked before dying.</i>

426
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,420
<i>I don't know which year
Taejo passed away.</i>

427
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,700
<i>I'm sure he doesn't have much time left.</i>

428
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:17,210
You are thinking
I don't have much time left.

429
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:27,650
Where did you come from?

430
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:35,080
After what happened with Court Lady Oh,
I looked into you.

431
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,380
Your childhood friends
and hometown relatives...

432
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:43,900
I questioned all of Wook's
household embers.

433
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,870
I could only conclude that you
suddenly became a different person.

434
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:55,100
You were a completely different person.

435
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,570
My senses tell me that
you are similar to Ji Mong.

436
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,880
You know the future that we do not.

437
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,471
Did you know that my 4th son was
born with the star to become a king?

438
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:27,980
Crown Prince Moo and So
are both destined to become kings.

439
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:33,180
No one knows what will happen
here in this palace.

440
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,180
You will be observing all of it.

441
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,080
Even so, do not get involved.

442
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:51,620
Can't you just send me far away?

443
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:57,350
I no longer think
I can handle living here.

444
00:44:57,350 --> 00:45:00,390
Close your eyes to the things
you cannot control.

445
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:03,200
If you cannot keep silent
about what goes on here

446
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,000
you will be in the same situation,
no matter where you go.

447
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:19,660
Do not get so hung up on the future
that you lose what you have now.

448
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,310
Soo Yeon called you her daughter.

449
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:30,670
So you are a daughter to me and
that is why I am giving you this advice.

450
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:33,380
Are you all right?

451
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,680
Let me see.

452
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,920
It's fine. It's nothing.

453
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,290
What do you mean?
How many times is that now?

454
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,920
Let me see.

455
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:56,590
What happened?

456
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,650
I shouldn't ask, right?

457
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:08,900
How about if I hold you?

458
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:12,410
Can I do that?

459
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:26,550
When you went through a hard time,
I'm sorry I wasn't there with you.

460
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,180
It was before I met you.

461
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,590
That's why I feel more sorry.

462
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,430
I feel more sorry about that
than anything.

463
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:37,890
The fact that I didn't know you then.

464
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:43,470
I want only good things to happen
for you and to make you happy now.

465
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:47,500
Trust in me.

466
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,260
Who are you to be able to do that?

467
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:56,450
I have never had those
expectations of you.

468
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,330
Woo Hee.

469
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:06,540
I still have more to confess to you.

470
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:28,090
Are you upset about something?

471
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,650
Why do you look so down?

472
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,290
Did something happen with Baek Ah?

473
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,460
How did you say you met Baek Ah?

474
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:43,860
Oh.

475
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:49,750
It was before I entered the palace.
I met him in the market.

476
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:53,350
He knew my cousin too. That's how.

477
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,240
He seems like a good person.

478
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:59,660
I can guarantee that he is.

479
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:02,410
If it were the old me...

480
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:06,330
I would never had met him.

481
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:12,260
Now that I was put into this position,
I ended up meeting him.

482
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:17,430
I can't tell you everything.

483
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:21,790
He is only coming here because of you.

484
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,460
So, don't push him away too much.

485
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:25,540
No.

486
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,970
We won't be getting any closer.

487
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:32,780
Soon...

488
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,780
I'll be leaving.

489
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:39,050
Leaving? Where to?

490
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:42,050
Do you remember when we first met?

491
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:45,970
We became close because we had
gone through similar hardships.

492
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:49,100
Why did we go through
something like that?

493
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:51,940
We didn't ask each other.

494
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:55,310
Let's keep it that way in the future.

495
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:58,430
It's better not to know.

496
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:03,520
That way, you won't be in a difficult
situation if something happens.

497
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:08,580
The peace gathering is tomorrow.

498
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:11,500
You'll make me look good, won't you?

499
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,200
Yes, of course.

500
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,850
You'll be the prettiest girl
from the Gyobang.

501
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:19,940
I want them to see me once...

502
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:23,780
and never be able to forget me.

503
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,720
Make me look that way.

504
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:35,860
That's how I want to be remembered.

505
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:51,010
Is that girl prepared?

506
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:53,650
The peace gathering will be
the ideal opportunity.

507
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,460
She is full of hatred for the king.

508
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,330
Do not worry.

509
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:00,490
It must be kept secret from my mother.

510
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:05,270
As much as she hates the king,
she also has great affection for him.

511
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,800
You should cancel your appearance
at the peace gathering.

512
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,800
You do not look well at all.

513
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,360
I agree.

514
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,440
You usually do not
attend the peace gathering.

515
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,360
You are only going because of the
powerful families attending.

516
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,910
My uncle Wang Shik Ryeom will be there.

517
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,990
But I can tend to him. You should rest.

518
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,790
I think it would best to attend.

519
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:43,980
The goal of your appearance today was to
show how healthy you are, Your Majesty.

520
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:48,520
You must be there even briefly
in order to stop the rumors.

521
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:52,030
You are right.

522
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,360
I cannot give them any openings.

523
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:03,050
Let us get going.

524
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:20,810
Soo.

525
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,400
Let's get married.

526
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:34,950
What?

527
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,310
If we get married,
you can leave the Gyobang and palace.

528
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:39,550
Let's do that.

529
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:43,150
I can't do that.

530
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:52,320
If you really do not like me,
we can divorce once we leave the palace.

531
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,900
I will do that for you, so let's leave.

532
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,510
You have a lot of work to do,
Your Highness.

533
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:02,530
You don't need to leave because of me.

534
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,370
And the king...

535
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,830
worries and thinks about you
a great deal.

536
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:14,850
He is constantly testing his children.

537
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:17,380
He is a king before he is a father.

538
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,020
I do not want to be by his side.

539
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,250
What if...

540
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,560
you were to become king, Your Highness?

541
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,810
Would you still leave?

542
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:44,830
If I were king, would you leave with me?

543
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,450
While it was hard to travel as an ambassador.

544
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:51,580
I often felt very free.

545
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:54,090
I thought of you every time.

546
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:58,150
I wanted you to feel freedom like that.

547
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:03,400
I want to be with you in peace,
with nothing getting in our way.

548
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:05,830
If that can't happen...

549
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:10,540
being king or whatever else
has no meaning to me.

550
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,540
Come with me.

551
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:30,690
You are my person, after all.

552
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,910
No.

553
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:46,280
I cannot marry you to
leave the palace, Your Highness.

554
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,320
Soo!

555
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:05,090
A prince marrying a water maid?

556
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,420
Don't manipulate Soo with such lies.

557
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:12,600
If I say it is marriage, it is marriage.

558
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:17,540
She was put in danger...

559
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,000
all because of you.

560
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:28,830
She ended up here because she got mixed
up in a fight between you and Queen Yoo.

561
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:31,590
It started with you.

562
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,630
Now you want to marry her?

563
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,200
I cannot forgive you.

564
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,600
I feel the same way.

565
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:46,630
I gave you everything you needed
to prove Hae Soo's innocence.

566
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,340
In the end, you couldn't do it.

567
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,740
Your uselessness makes me shake in anger.

568
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:55,790
You!

569
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,020
<i>You got it wrong!</i>

570
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:27,200
Why would you point the knife there?
You should wind it in.

571
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:17,150
Stop pretending to care about her

572
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:19,260
and turn your back on her
like you've been doing.

573
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,440
You're no longer in-laws.

574
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,270
She has nothing to do with you.
