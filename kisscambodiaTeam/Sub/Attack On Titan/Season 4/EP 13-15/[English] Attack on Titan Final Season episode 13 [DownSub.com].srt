2
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,340
It was called gas weapon.

3
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,750
The gas contained my spinal fluid.

4
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,170
Any subject of Ymir who inhaled
even just a small bit of the gas

5
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,720
would be frozen in-place.

6
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,390
He would lose control of his
body and fall unconscious.

7
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,500
All I had to do was give an order.

8
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,990
Through the Path, I could send the power
of Titans to those coordinates.

9
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:56,040
That's why the Titans from that
village moved according to my will.

10
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,640
It's not "that village."

11
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,110
It's Ragako.

12
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,150
That is the name of the village
that you slaughtered.

13
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,430
At least get the name right, you bearded shit.

14
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,610
Yeah, I wish I didn't
have to do it, too.

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,640
But if I hadn’t, they would've found out
that I was aligned to Eldian restoration,

16
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,140
thus making it impossible for me
to bring hope to this island.

17
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,320
...Didn't I already tell you
all this when I first landed?

18
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,740
Why do you keep asking me that?

19
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,490
Because I can tell that you
don't even feel a speck of guilt.

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,009
Not that I know whether you
really want to save Eldia or not,

21
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,030
but it's certain that human
lives mean nothing to you.

22
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,979
I bet you're not popular
with the ladies.

23
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,590
Don’t think that you can see through people.

24
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:43,430
I know.

25
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,350
And I was... popular enough.

26
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,240
Oh, is that so?

27
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,170
Anyway, when can I meet Eren
and begin the experiment?

28
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,180
It’s not up to me.

29
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,210
We're waiting for the order from HQ.

30
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,180
Tell them if they think they have
time to wait, they're gravely mistaken.

31
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,150
We are on the same page about that.

00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,300

What a nice place!

48
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,690
It's the first time
I've been in a place like this!

49
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,890

Yes!

Well, nothing...

59
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,640
Is there really a Marleyan
POW working here?

60
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,340
It's true, so try to be nonchalant.

61
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,810
Soldiers come here often.

62
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:21,380
It will be great if we can at least
have a Marleyan acquaintance here.

63
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,380
Mr. Blouse!

64
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,280
Thank you for coming.

65
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,890
Thank you for inviting us.

00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,200
Well, what do we have here?

00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,430
Quite a crowd there.

68
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,030
I brought my family along.

69
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,600
You did say it's your treat.

70
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,620
Sorry.

71
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,960
Never mind.

72
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,490
It’s all on me.

73
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,740
Please, come on in.

-I see, I see.

That's Mr. Nicolo, the Marleyan who
invited Mr. Blouse here.

77
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,390
Try asking him.

he said he wanted to treat us the meal
that he never got to make for her.

82
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,320
I personally think they were in love.

00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,440
I've never had a meal this
delicious in my entire life!

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,710
There's still more!

89
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,610
Just wait until you taste the main dish!

90
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,350
Nicolo, you got visitors.

91
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,620
Eh? Who would come at this hour?

92
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,610
The Survey Corps.

00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,890
It's you guys?

94
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,430
What's wrong?

95
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,450
Something urgent?

96
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,950
I'm busy with entertaining some
important guests right now.

97
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,190
Well, it's fine. You can carry on.

98
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,160
But we have a few questions for you later.

99
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,540
Questions?

100
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,240
About what?

101
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,070
I mean, well, you also have...
concerns, don't you?

102
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,880
About the detained volunteers.

103
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,370
We need you to assist in the investigation.

104
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,480
Okay.

105
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,510
Got it.

106
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,720
You guys can wait here for a while.

107
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,420
Oh, never knew about this room.

108
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,290
I bet it's a room exclusively
for those Military Police.

109
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,110
This is...

110
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,610
the wine that people in the military talk about.

111
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,230
I heard only the officers
have the right to drink this.

112
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,350
What did you say?

113
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,630
We're officers too in
Survey Corps, right?

114
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:42,659
Yeah.

115
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,280
We should deserve some treat
once in a while.

116
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,250
Just a sip…

117
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,270
Get your hands off that!

118
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,080
What's wrong, Nicolo?

119
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,970
I was just joking around.

120
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,130
No need to overreact.

121
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,000
The Eldians can’t afford such wine!

122
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:02,910
Nicolo...

123
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,440
You're still saying that?

124
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,050
Drinking wine has nothing to do
with who I am.

125
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,130
Don't touch me, Eldians.

126
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,700
Don't act like we're buddies just
because we know each other.

127
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,680
Then who do you think you are?

128
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,970
In here you are...

129
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,180
"Nothing but a POW"?

130
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,880
Now we're even, Eldians.

131
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,570
What happened to him?

132
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,590
Dammit!

133
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,090
Hell if I know.

134
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,650
Now.

135
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,000
Ugh! My stomach hurts!

136
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,530
Are you okay, Ben?

137
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,430
Did you eat something wrong?

138
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,330
Going to the bathroom might help!

139
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,440
And I may even be able to help my brother!

140
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,460
Good luck.

141
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,880
You kids.

142
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,470
This isn't the way to the bathroom.

143
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,990
We're not looking for the bathroom, Mr. Nicolo.

144
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,290
We came from Marley.

145
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,000
We are Warrior Candidates!

146
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,050
Huh?

147
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:19,690
We believe this island will soon receive
massive attack from armies around the world.

148
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,150
Please hold on until then.

149
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,640
And also tell this to your
fellow Marleyans.

150
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,630
H-Hold on a second.

151
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,410
Why are the warrior candidates here?

152
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,970
The devils launched an attack
on Liberio district.

153
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:39,020
We jumped onto a retreating enemy
airship and landed here.

154
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:43,289
Did you...

155
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,450
...kill anyone?

156
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,460
Like a...

157
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,370
...female soldier?

158
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,870
Yes, I took her down.

159
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,540
But only a few of them.

160
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,390
Gabi!

161
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,170
-We will have our revenge
-Wait!

162
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,960
-for what they did to our home soon.
-Hey!

163
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,920
We definitely won't lose to
those underhanded devils…

164
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,170
Gabi, stop it!

165
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,580
What is it?

166
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,670
So you...

167
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,820
killed her....

168
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,040
So you're the one who killed Sasha?!

169
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,850
Falco?

170
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,720
Hey!

171
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:27,900
Falco!

172
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,070
Are you okay? Falco!

173
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,370
Falco!

174
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,950
Falco, wake up!

175
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,210
Hear me!

176
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,020
Come on!

177
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:36,930
Shit!

178
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,790
Falco!

179
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,320
Nicolo?!

180
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,200
What did you do to Ben and Mia?

181
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,850
She is the one who killed Sasha.

182
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,040
She took your daughter's life.

183
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,190
She's still a kid, but she's a
well-trained Marleyan soldier.

184
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,630
She pulled the trigger
inside the retreating airship

185
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,790
and killed her.

186
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,070
Daughter...?

187
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,620
Mr. Blouse.

188
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:16,970
Here.

189
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,880
If you can't kill her,
then I will do it for you.

190
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,660
You won't mind, right?

191
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,310
This is bad!

192
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,010
Everyone, come here!

193
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,940
Huh?

194
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,770
What?

195
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,180
The kid who killed Sasha?

196
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,060
What does this mean, Nicolo?

197
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,590
I heard she was on the run.

198
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,230
What are you trying to do?

199
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:43,970
Hey!

200
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,530
Stay away! Back off!

201
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,410
I'm just going to avenge Sasha!

202
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,870
Don't move!

203
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,620
Stop it.

204
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,050
Falco is innocent!

205
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,580
How is he related to you?

206
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,760
He ended up like this
because he tried to protect you!

207
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,760
Is he someone special to you?

208
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,920
I also had someone special to me!

209
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,160
She's an Eldian!

210
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,920
The descendant of devils!

211
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,460
But she enjoyed my cook more
than anyone else did!

212
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,600
She saved me from this shitty war.

213
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,830
She had me realize that it’s the real me
when I cook something that makes people happy!

214
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,770
Her name is Sasha Blouse.

215
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,460
That is the name of the girl you killed!

216
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,280
I lost people who were special to me, too!

217
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,140
Because Sasha Braus shot them!

218
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,190
That's why I got my revenge!

219
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,720
She's the one who killed them first!

220
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,120
I don’t care about who did it first!

221
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,810
Come to your senses!

222
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,850
You're a Marleyan soldier, aren't you!

223
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,680
I'm sure that devil woman
brainwashed you!

224
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,780
Don't let the devils win!

225
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,260
Nicolo.

226
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,940
Give me the knife.

227
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,100
Please.

228
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,120
That's enough.

229
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,280
Mr. Blouse.

230
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,490
Please put down the knife.

231
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,390
Sasha was a hunter.

232
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:31,810
What?

233
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,880
I taught her how to use a bow
when she was little,

234
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,810
and we'd go hunting in the forest.

235
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,950
'Cause that's how we lived.

236
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,840
But...

237
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,570
I knew that the time has changed,
and we couldn't keep living that way.

238
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:50,640
So I made Sasha leave the forest.

239
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,860
Then the world got bigger.

240
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:57,030
Sasha became a soldier
and went off to attack other lands,

241
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:00,170
shot people,
and then got herself killed.

242
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,790
I only wanted her to leave the forest.

243
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,920
Turns out, the world was a colossal forest,

244
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,900
where it was still about
killing or being killed.

245
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:16,070
I believe Sasha got killed 'cause she
wandered too long in that forest.

246
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,400
We've gotta at least get
the kids outta this forest.

247
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,840
Or else...

248
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:26,640
We would just keep on circling
around the same place.

249
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:34,240
That's why it is the adults’ job
to shoulder the sins and hatred of the past.

250
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,360
Mr. Nicolo.

251
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,950
Let Ben go.

252
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,000
Good.

253
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,080
Lisa, move him slowly.

254
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,970
Yes.

255
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,820
Show me your wound.

256
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:52,800
Mia.

257
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,990
Are you okay?

258
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,680
You really...

259
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,340
...don't hate me?

260
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,900
-How dare you killed her!
-Hey! Stop!

261
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,370
-Murderer!
-Kaya!

262
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,780
I thought you were my friend!

263
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,150
-Take her to the other room. Come on.
-Why!? Why did you do it!?

264
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,330
The main dish has gone cold now.

265
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,980
Hange.

266
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,810
Please rinse that kid's mouth for me.

267
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,960
Some of that wine got in.

268
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,170
Eh?

269
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,040
But... it's probably too late.

270
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,180
Is there anything in that wine?

271
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,350
I think...

272
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,560
...it's Zeke's spinal fluid.

273
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:04,930
[Currently Shareable Information:]

274
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,890
Zackly was killed?

275
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
Yes.

276
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:16,820
The Yeagerists practically have control
over everything within the walls.

277
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:24,170
It is believed that all the chaos is being
caused by Zeke, through Eren and Yelena.

278
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,940
And then?

279
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:32,600
Eren will be brought to Zeke, following
the Yeagerists' demand.

280
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,730
Is Pixis really going to
obediently roll with it?

281
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,080
As you thought, the commander
remains steadfast.

282
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,220
The military plans to have
someone eat Eren, right?

283
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,490
By taking advantage of us.

284
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,860
That is right.

285
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:54,170
I've saved Eren's life over and over.

286
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,170
Many of my comrades died each time.

287
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:01,760
I did it because I believed it was
the best hope for humanity's survival.

288
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,310
And this is where that
belief has gotten me.

289
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,020
It's like an awful joke.

290
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,100
Just what was that hope
we looked forward to?

291
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:18,450
All that hardship has led to this farce?

292
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,690
You gotta be kidding me.

293
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,320
This got to be a joke.

294
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,280
If it's about feeding someone to a Titan,
there's a better option.

295
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,320
Eh?

296
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,540
What do you mean?

297
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,080
Zeke's spinal fluid is in the wine?

298
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,580
I don't have any proof.

299
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,920
But...

300
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,250
the survey ships have been packed
with this type of wine since the very beginning.

301
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,110
A short-term surveying voyage shouldn’t
need wine, much less one in such a huge amount.

302
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,510
One more time.

303
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,550
And also...

304
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:53,450
Just as I started to settle
here as a cook,

305
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,190
I was told to serve it to the military,

306
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,690
-starting with high-ranking officers.
-One more.

307
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,050
By whom?!

308
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,340
Yelena.

309
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:08,020
As far as I know, she was the
one who started all this.

310
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:11,300
I'm not sure about the other volunteers.

311
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,530
I-I've never heard about this before.

312
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:17,260
But that doesn't make sense!

313
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,599
Eldians will freeze once they
drink Zeke's spinal fluid, right?

314
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,910
That's what Zeke said.

315
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,619
It's not like anyone had seen it,
so we can't even confirm it.

316
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,410
But...

317
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,620
The effect of that one lie is enormous.

318
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:40,340
We won't even suspect getting dozed with
his spinal liquid if we don't see the symptoms.

319
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,000
But... still...

320
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,370
That's just your theory, right?

321
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,580
Yeah.

322
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
I have no proof.

323
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,710
But every Marleyan soldier knows about it.

324
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,840
Just how Zeke's spinal fluid
has been used in the past.

325
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:00,580
Around ten years ago, Marley took down
the enemy nation's capital in one night.

326
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,630
Hundreds of Titans appeared in
the town out of nowhere, after all.

327
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,190
They must be plotting
to do something like that.

328
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:16,210
Though, why I was asked to give the military
higher-ups that suspicious wine is beyond me.

329
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:20,650
So when you took that wine
from me back then...

330
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,590
...it was to protect us?

331
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,610
Dunno.

332
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,910
Just what am I doing?

333
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,170
I was supposed to survey the island
of devils and save the world.

334
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,660
Now that I’ve told you all about this,
I'm sure I won't live for long.

335
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,240
But Mr. Blouse.

336
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,310
I still can't be
as forgiving as you, but...

337
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,490
...I hope this can make up
even a little for what I did.

338
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,660
I tried to kill a child...

339
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,300
What's wrong with me?

340
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,950
Nicolo...

341
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,440
Why...

342
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,990
...did you protect me?

343
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,440
It's nothing.

344
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,800
I don't have any particular reason.

345
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:10,710
I'm the one who killed
your precious comrade.

346
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,300
I'm also the one who beat
the guard with rock over and over.

347
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,760
Falco did nothing wrong.

348
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,830
You should just kill me, not him.

349
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,900
We won't.

350
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,670
But you do want to kill me, don’t you?

351
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,480
I don't want to.

352
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:31,550
Kill, kill, kill, that's all
you can talk about.

353
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,580
You're just like someone I knew.

354
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:43,990
What's wrong?

355
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,530
Commander?

356
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,050
Floch?!

357
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,200
Glad to find you.

358
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,470
You should know Zeke's location.

359
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,170
You're going to take us to him.

360
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,990
Listen, we have no intention
to oppose you guys.

361
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,310
We already rejected that offer.

362
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,290
We won't negotiate with the military.

363
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,790
And why is that?

364
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,790
It was Eren's decision.

365
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:15,000
Commander Pixis would never bet
the fate of the island on our hands.

366
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,440
He's probably busy right now
trying to devise a plan

367
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,720
to steal the Founding Titan from Eren
when they're showing us the way.

368
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,380
You're delusional.

369
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:30,990
Or is that what your friend
from Garrison told you?

370
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,990
Do I look like one of your
obedient subordinates

371
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,820
who will answer all your questions?

372
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,950
Or should I prove it to you that
I'm no longer your subordinate?

373
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,770
I suggest you come with us
before I do that.

374
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,800
Dammit!

375
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,940
How did they know we're here?

376
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:47,760
Griez?

377
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,980
Was this Yelena's order?

378
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,750
Nicolo.

379
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,420
You've gotten too close to Eldians.

380
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,340
I knew this day would come.

381
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,190
Thank God I didn’t tell you
how to contact them.

382
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,320
Listen to me, Floch!

383
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,110
There is no time for us
to fight amongst ourselves!

384
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:12,690
Wine contaminated with Zeke's spinal fluid
has been served throughout the military!

385
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:16,150
We’ve all fallen into Zeke’s trap!

386
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:21,430
Even if that's true, the idiotic military
police will just look even stupider.

387
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,520
Is that all?

388
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,630
I didn't say a thing about
the military police drinking the wine.

389
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,230
Could it be...

390
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,060
you guys knew about the wine?!

391
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,410
Please keep your voice down
within the restaurant.

392
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,730
We're taking off.

393
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,850
Yeah.

394
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,040
That voice just now...

395
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,320
Did you come with Floch and others?

396
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,690
Yeah.

397
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,730
I wanted to...

398
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,910
...talk with you guys.

[Preview]

409
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,630
The Yeagerists have captured
Hange and others.

410
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,840
Eren said to Mikasa and Armin
as he gazed at them.

411
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:51,610
"I want to talk."
