00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,580
Take a close look at it, Zeke.

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,250
This is Liberio where we live.

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,980
It is as small as a birdcage
compared to the rest of the world.

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:14,770
We must live here, unable to go anywhere else,
for the rest of our lives.

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,930
Zeke, do you want to leave this place?

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,510
Yes.

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,870
I do.

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,750
Oh my, what a surprise.

10
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,180
Visitors this early?

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,420
I'll come back later.

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,570
Ah, it's okay. We were just leaving.

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,680
Oh, Eldians.

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,410
What are you doing?

15
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,190
We have the permit to go out.

16
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,760
I’m the cleaner of this tower, and
it's my job to get rid of the filth.

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,240
You devils have tainted this place! How dare you!

18
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,700
You, the descendants of devils
who've massacred countless people!

19
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,660
And yet, you still breed like pests!

20
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,710
Damn devils!

21
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,610
Stay in the internment zone, dammit!

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,050
You stink.

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,360
-Keep it in mind, Zeke.
-Bumped into such filth this early!

24
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:11,870
This is the outside world.

25
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,020
If you hate this world,
then you must change it.

26
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,050
Zeke.

27
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,470
You must save everyone.

40
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,850
So one of these children
will be my successor?

41
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,190
Yes, one of them will be chosen.

42
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,320
There's one who’s falling behind. Who's he?

43
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,690
Ah, Yeager again?

44
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,570
All the other children are desperate
to earn the title of honorary Marleyans.

45
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:20,829
But I don’t see such drive on him at all.

46
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,960
I don’t even know what he’s doing here.

47
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,180
How was your training, Zeke?

48
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,030
It was really tough.

49
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,150
I see.

50
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,560
But you will surely become a Warrior.

51
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,970
You have special power, after all.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,140
Moreover, you're our boy.

53
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,490
Yes!

54
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,010
Dad, mom, please help me
take care of Zeke again tonight.

55
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,350
Okay.

56
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,180
I baked your favourite pie.

57
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,380
Hooray!

Social dance club again?

59
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,240
Zeke is really lonely, you know.

60
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,490
I'm doing this for the health
of the people in this zone.

61
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,030
I'm sure Zeke will someday
understand the good deeds we’ve done.

62
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,690
This is the Fall of Lago,
which took place 1,200 years ago.

63
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,120
The metropolitan city Lago was destroyed at that time.

64
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:19,230
The same Titans also caused the Devastation
of Monte and the Ravaging of Valle.

65
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,150
Hundreds of thousands of Marleyans
were killed by the Eldian Empire.

66
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:29,040
The refugees who somehow managed
to flee from Lago wandered the ruins.

67
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,130
However, the Eldian Empire had
planted Titans on their escape route.

68
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,940
Then as the sun rose, the Titans
started approaching the Marleyans and…

69
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,780
Yes, I get it.

70
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,860
More people died, right?

71
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,159
Has your father properly taught
you our true history?

72
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,530
He taught me that Eldians did
awful things to Marleyans.

73
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,480
Which is why we must atone for that here.

74
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,080
Zeke, do you want to become
a Warrior and fight for Marley?

75
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,680
Yes.

76
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,030
I want to become a Warrior.

77
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,910
It's time for bed now.

78
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,010
Oh! I can continue to read you
the story about the cat family.

79
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,600
Yay!

80
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,610
Begin!

81
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,620
You're so bad at this, Dad!

82
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,490
Dad!

83
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,670
Is that you, Zeke?

84
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,690
I finished early today, so…

85
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,310
Ah, I see.

86
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,700
Then that means we can
focus on studying today.

87
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,770
Yeah...

88
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,480
In other words, the Fall of Lago
never happened.

89
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,490
The Devastation of Monte and
the Ravaging of Valle

90
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,770
are also made-up stories to
serve Marley's purposes.

91
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,640
Eldians have never had such cruel
culture or custom.

92
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,530
Most of all...

93
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,710
Our great founder Ymir would never
wish for it, therefore it's impossible.

94
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,830
That's right.

95
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,850
You finally understand, Zeke!

96
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,880
Yes!

97
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,200
If you don't have the drive, leave!

98
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:37,240
Marley is looking for those who are prepared
to devote everything to their motherland.

99
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:43,040
An Eldian like you would never be
entrusted with one of nation's Titans!

100
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,350
Hey!

101
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,780
You over there!

102
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,150
Pass me the ball, please!

103
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,750
Not bad for a little kid.

104
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,920
Eh?

105
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,510
Nice catch!

106
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,090
I’m tired of throwing the ball against the wall.

107
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,950
Would you care to join me?

108
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,980
Red armband!

109
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,120
Then you're...

110
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,270
A Marleyan Warrior you kids
are striving to be.

111
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,540
Though, my Beast Titan is not
that useful in combat.

112
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,130
That’s why I'm here playing ball to kill time.

113
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,600
Tom Ksaver.

114
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,490
My real job is a researcher
in Titan science.

115
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,970
Here, what's your name?

116
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,870
I'm Zeke Yeager!

117
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,960
Zeke, huh?

118
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,930
You’ve got a gift.

119
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,909
You can make a good pitcher.

120
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,350
I'm home!

121
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,480
Dad! Today I…

122
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,860
That's not what we agreed on!

123
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,690
Just what is going on, Grice?

124
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,850
The plan will be ruined if we
can't make Zeke a Warrior!

125
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,280
But according to Owl,

126
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:07,410
he can’t intervene in the selection
unless Zeke gets high marks.

127
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:11,590
I got it, okay? I know this is our
once-in-a-lifetime chance!

128
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,790
But it's still possible for Zeke
to earn the position, right?

129
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,380
Yes, that's right.

130
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,590
Zeke will surely…

131
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,520
Ah...

132
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,380
I'm sorry…

133
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,650
Zeke!

134
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,270
You can do it!

135
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,419
You're our boy, after all!

136
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,850
I believe I already said
Marley didn't need you.

137
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,880
Why are you here?

138
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:45,330
To show my loyalty to Marley
and atone for the sins of Eldians!

139
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,120
Please allow me to participate
in the open training!

140
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,960
What are you doing, Yeager?

141
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,490
Run! Come on, run!

142
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,540
Dammit! It's not supposed to be like this!

143
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,090
Don't say that!

144
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,830
That boy is doing his best.

145
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,620
But still not enough to become a Warrior!

146
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,750
You sure were a mess that day.

147
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,390
It's not funny at all.

148
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,960
Since then, they’ve always asked me to run errands.

149
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,490
I’m hopeless.

150
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,730
To me, you don't look like
you want to be a Warrior, though.

151
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,710
I have to become one.

152
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,370
Yet, I can't catch up with the rest…

153
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,280
It's not your fault.

154
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,030
You must think being a Warrior is ridiculous.

155
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:53,800
It's a stupid move to shorten your lifespan
and invade other countries for Marley.

156
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,810
Then why did you become
a Warrior, Mr. Ksaver?

157
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,380
I wanted to know the secrets
of the Titans.

158
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,170
I'm a researcher, after all.

159
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:11,840
They said it all started when the Founder
Ymir came in contact with something.

160
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,760
I wanted to know what
happened exactly at that moment.

161
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,540
I wanted it so much that I've shortened my own
lifespan to look into a Titan's memories.

162
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,390
That's why I'm completely useless in war.

163
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,130
However...

164
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:30,450
hate and conflict just sound ridiculous
compared to the mysteries of Titans.

165
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:37,350
That's why we're alike, for we both don’t care
to play this war game along with the others.

166
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,330
We are one of the few sensible people in this world.

167
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,470
This is for the best.

168
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,380
It's okay to stay in the internment
zone forever.

169
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,500
As long as we can stay alive.

170
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,420
We finally got something on them.

171
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,930
They're calling themselves
Eldian restorationists.

172
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,050
There are a lot of them this time.

173
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,740
I heard a traitor known as
the Owl started it.

174
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,970
We’ve already got a few leads.

175
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,090
All that is left to do is to get some proof.

176
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,990
It's only a matter of time to take them all down.

177
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,140
Zeke?

178
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,450
What's wrong?

179
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,670
Hurry up and eat.

180
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,090
M-My stomach is a little...

181
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,380
Dad.

182
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,940
Mom.

183
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,790
Please don't do anything
dangerous anymore.

184
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,200
If they find out, they will
send all of us to Paradis.

185
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,920
To the island of devils...

186
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,630
...where they will turn us into Titans.

187
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,950
Have you learned anything
from me all this time?

188
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:58,700
Unless someone stands up, everyone is
doomed to die inside these walls.

189
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,840
That's right.

190
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:04,370
We told you that this is a fight for your
future and the future of all Eldians, remember?

191
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,710
Even if it means I’ll end up like aunt Faye?

192
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,850
Zeke!

193
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,900
For starters, Faye was killed
only because this world is crazy!

194
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:20,420
We must fight to prevent anyone
from suffering the same fate as Faye!

195
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:25,480
We must take the strong Eldia back
from Marley and win the right we deserve!

196
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,900
[The available intelligence for now]
[Titan Research]
[The research concerning the unique power of
Subjects of Ymir to become Titans.
A field of study started since the Eldian Empire.
It encompasses not only the biology of Titans themselves,
but also the ways to deal with Eldians
who possess the power and their ideologies.
Though it has been researched for many years,
the truth of Titans still hasn’t been found.]

197
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,650
Unbelievable...

198
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,790
Your parents are restoratonists?!

199
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,290
Your whole family will be
sent to Paradis at this rate...

200
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,300
Yeah.

201
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,450
Mr. Ksaver.

202
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,840
Thank you for playing catch with me.

203
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,770
I'll remember you
even after I turn into a Titan.

204
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,260
Well then, I'm going.

205
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,990
Accuse them.

206
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:05,990
Eh?

207
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,270
That is the only way.

208
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,230
If you show your loyalty to Marley by
turning your parents in to the authorities,

209
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,920
you and your grandparents
should be safe.

210
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,460
No, I can't do that…

211
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:19,440
Zeke!

212
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,890
Your parents have done
something awful to you.

213
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,700
They gave up on you and didn't
care about your feelings at all.

214
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,000
They don’t love you.

215
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,990
Zeke...

216
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,310
...you did nothing wrong.

217
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:40,410
You're a smart and good boy.

218
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,090
Go easy on me, okay, Zeke?

219
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,010
Ah, I suppose it's too much
for an elderly to handle.

220
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,090
Hey, I'm not that old…

221
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,170
Mr. Ksaver!

222
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,450
My term is drawing to a close soon.

223
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,850
Yeah...

224
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,720
I don’t have much time left, but I don't
regret devoting myself to my research.

225
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,020
I should be able to present
my findings in one compilation.

226
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,840
Oh, what did you find out?

227
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:22,690
The various effects the Founding Titan
has brought to the Subjects of Ymir.

228
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,110
Ooh.

229
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,920
That memory control stuff?

230
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:32,190
Not just memory, it can also change
our body structure.

231
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:39,350
About 600 years ago, an epidemic killed
so many people that the population plunged.

232
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:45,810
But one day, the disease was
eradicated from the Eldian Empire.

233
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,530
The king at the time used the power
of the Founding Titan

234
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,820
and redesigned the bodies of
the Subjects of Ymir.

235
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,440
It proves that wherever we are,

236
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,480
we Subjects of Ymir are like
a part of the Founding Titan's body.

237
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,810
Scary, right?

238
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,110
Then...

239
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,560
Why did you give birth to another devil?

240
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:13,670
Can the Founding Titan make the Subjects
of Ymir lose their ability of giving birth?

241
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,340
If no more Subjects of Ymir were born...

242
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,190
Titans would vanish from this world
in the next hundred years.

243
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:28,010
The world wouldn't have to live
in fear of the Titans or suffer anymore.

244
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,880
Moreover, if we'd never been born...

245
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,200
...we would’ve never had to suffer!

246
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,590
Mr. Ksaver?

247
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,940
I never told you this.

248
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,530
But I once had a family.

249
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,000
I was young and stupid back then,
so I took off my armband.

250
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:53,260
I lived with my wife and we had a child,
all while keeping it a secret that I'm an Eldian.

251
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,740
My wife was a Marleyan.

252
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,830
However, there was no way I'd
be able to deceive her forever.

253
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,680
After she learned that I'm an Eldian...

254
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,720
She cut our son's throat and then her own’s,
and they both died.

255
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:13,950
I became a Warrior so that I can
kill myself in an honourable way.

256
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,300
But...

257
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,570
Over the last thirteen years.

258
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,810
I've devoted myself to studying Titans.
I'm so happy that I met you

259
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,580
and played catch with you.

260
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,210
You remind me of my dead boy.

261
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,610
And I tried to run away from my sins
using the power of the Titan.

262
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,270
If only I hadn't been born in this world!

263
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,420
I will inherit the Beast Titan.

264
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,020
Not for Marley.

265
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,630
I'll make the plan of retaking the Founding Titan
a success and save the world.

266
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,840
I'll free the people of the world
from their fear of the Titans...

267
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,690
...and free the Eldians from their suffering!

268
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,800
This is the information I never
told Marley about.

269
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,410
It's the way to break pass
the vow renouncing war.

270
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,819
And surprisingly enough, Zeke...

271
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:10,980
You are the only one who can make this happen.

272
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:17,420
When a Titan with royal blood makes physical
contact with the Founding Titan’s successor,

273
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,060
he should be able to draw out its power.

274
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,940
But you're not the one who
can wield that power.

275
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,089
The actual decision can only be made
by the one who possesses the Founding Titan.

276
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,580
In other words, your role is to be the key.

277
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,090
You must pass the Founding Titan
to someone you can trust.

278
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:39,790
Someone who can empathize
with our euthanasia plan.

279
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,200
You should be able to find that person.

280
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,130
I'll always be watching over you.

281
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,950
Zeke.

282
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,210
I will surely find it, Father.

283
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,010
Eren Yeager?

284
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,080
Yes.

285
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,480
Eren possesses the Founding Titan.

286
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,140
And what seems to be the vital
information is hidden in the basement

287
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,750
of his home in Shiganshina district
where he grew up.

288
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:19,260
Did you hear anything
from Eren about his father?

289
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,730
If I'm not mistaken,

290
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,260
Eren said he used to be a doctor
and is now missing.

291
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,110
How could this happen?

292
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,680
That father actually survived!

293
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,630
Eren...

294
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,200
We're his victims.

295
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,280
You’ve been brainwashed by your father.

296
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,640
I will surely come and save you someday!

297
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,710
You're starting to look like our father.

298
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,060
First off, Eren.

299
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,540
Thank you for agreeing
to meet me all the way here.

300
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,230
My thought is just like what
Yelena told you.

301
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,510
Would you support the Eldian
euthanasia plan?

302
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,870
It was four years ago.

303
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,720
One day, something happened that
opened our old man's memories.

304
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,800
The memory of him slaughtering
the royal family of the walls.

305
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,930
He moved around and smashed
young children like bugs.

306
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,650
I still remember how it felt.

307
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,910
If those children are still alive,

308
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,700
the Founding Titan will get
passed down to the royal family,

309
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,330
and we'll still be bound
by the vow renouncing war.

310
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,230
And we, humanity inside the walls,
will eventually die with it.

311
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,260
We survived because of their death.

312
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,750
I see.

313
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,890
So you believe that Father was right?

314
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,290
No.

315
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,030
Old man was mistaken.

316
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:58,310
And, I, whom he raised, am also
one of his mistakes.

317
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,500
If no Eldians had been born,

318
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,430
including those in this town,

319
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,980
none of them would have had to die
in the plan we're about to carry out.

320
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:12,390
There's no better salvation than
never having to be born in this world.

321
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,840
I'll do it.

322
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:19,630
I will put an end to 2,000 years of history
ruled by Titans with my very own hand.

323
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,300
I will keep going forward
until that day comes.

324
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,010
Isn't that right?

325
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,220
Brother.

326
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,500
Yes!

327
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,150
Yes. You're right.

328
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,430
Let's do it.

329
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:37,440
I would love to end this
with a firm handshake.

330
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,390
But, well, it would be bad if
we come into contact now.

331
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,600
Here, take this instead.

332
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,510
Eren.

333
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,860
We're going to save everyone.

334
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,490
The only salvation...

335
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,360
Eldian euthanasia...

336
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,850
What did you say?

337
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,130
Euthanasia?

338
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,290
Well, you're about to die inside
a Titan's stinky mouth,

339
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,950
all while hearing the sound of your own
body being chewed to pieces.

340
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,200
That's quite a merciful death
for you, don't you think?

341
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,010
Considering the lives of
my comrades that you stole.

342
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,790
I stole nothing.

343
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,200
I saved them.

344
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,440
I saved the children they would have...

345
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,930
...from this cruel world...

346
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,400
-Looks like you're growing another limb.
-Isn't that right?

347
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,360
Mr. Ksaver!

348
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:45,080
