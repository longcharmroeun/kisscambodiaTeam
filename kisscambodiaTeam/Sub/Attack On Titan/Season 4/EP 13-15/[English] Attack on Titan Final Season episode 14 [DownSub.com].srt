Why...

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,300
...did you protect me?

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,410
It's nothing.

5
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,630
I don't have any particular reason.

6
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,660
I'm the one who killed
your precious comrade.

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,379
I'm also the one who beat
the guard with rock over and over.

8
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,610
Falco did nothing wrong.

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,890
You should just kill me, not him.

10
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,620
We won't.

11
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,780
But you do want to kill me, don't you?

12
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,480
I don't want to.

13
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,610
Kill, kill, kill, that's all
you ever talk about.

14
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,730
You're just like someone I knew.

28
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,350
I want to have a quiet talk.

29
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,880
Conflict is not necessary
to solve Eldia's problems.

30
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,660
Hange and others will be fine.

We're just relocating them.

32
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,550
Eren.

33
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,440
We're the ones who wanted
to talk with you.

34
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,329
Why did you decide to attack
Marley on your own?

35
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:53,490
Have Zeke and Yelena really
won you over to their side?

36
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,940
I am free.

37
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,170
Eh?

38
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,320
Whatever I do,

39
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,890
whatever I choose,

40
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,000
it all comes from my own free will.

41
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,050
So everything you did after meeting
Yelena was out of your own free will?

42
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,320
Yes.

43
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,950
No, you're being controlled by them.

44
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,140
Even against people
from an enemy nation,

45
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,460
you're not the type of person who
would involve the innocents.

46
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,020
And you've always cared and
thought about us more than anyone else.

47
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,890
Isn't that right?

48
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,560
You saved me in that mountain hut,

49
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:38,430
and wrapped this scarf around me,

50
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,810
all because you're a kind perso--

51
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,770
I said keep your hands on the table.

52
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,180
I talked with Zeke in Liberio.

53
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,210
Just the two of us brothers.

54
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,610
Zeke knows more about Titans
than Marley does.

55
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,010
Armin.

56
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,960
You're still visiting Annie, aren't you?

57
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,840
Did you really do that
out of your own free will?

58
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,240
What?

59
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,220
If memory is what forms a person,

60
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,640
that means part of you has become Bertolt.

61
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,460
You're an enemy soldier who falls
in love with another enemy soldier.

62
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,390
Armin.

63
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,320
Your brain has been taken by Bertolt.

64
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,390
You're the one who is being
controlled by the enemy.

65
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,530
Eren, you--

66
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,260
Mikasa, you too.

67
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,530
The Ackerman clan was designed
to protect Eldia's king.

68
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,110
That moment, when you were
facing death, you obeyed my order.

69
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,880
"Fight."

70
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,280
Your instinct must've been awakened
at that instance.

71
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,370
All because you mistakenly recognized
me as the host you must protect.

72
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,070
You're wrong...

73
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,440
I'm wrong?

74
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,680
In what?

75
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,880
It's not... a mistake.

76
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,840
It's because of you, Eren, that
I was able to become strong.

77
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,510
It's all thanks to you!

78
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:30,090
Seems like once an Ackerman awakens,
they often suffer sudden headaches.

79
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:36,630
They say it happens because their true selves
try to resist being forced to protect the host.

80
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,970
Sounds familiar?

81
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:45,690
No...

82
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,300
That means...

83
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,420
No.

84
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,140
I am...

85
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:55,420
A clan created to follow orders at
the cost of losing their true selves.

86
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,670
In other words, you're a slave.

87
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,170
Stop it, Eren!

88
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,520
Do you know what I hate
the most in this world?

89
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,500
Those who are not free.

90
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,390
Or livestocks.

91
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,510
Eren!

92
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,090
Just looking at you irritates me.

93
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,320
I finally understand the reason why.

94
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:21,530
I couldn't stand looking at a slave who
always follows orders without question.

95
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,580
Since we were little...

96
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,390
Mikasa.

97
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,800
I have always hated you.

98
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,430
Eren!

99
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,800
How dare you make Mikasa--

100
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,220
Mikasa?

101
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,220
Your whole action in life was
dictated by your Ackerman blood.

102
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,360
No...

103
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,510
I'm not...

104
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,400
That's all you are.

105
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,670
Mr. Yeager?

106
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,840
It's nothing.

107
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,720
Hey, Armin.

108
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,600
We've never fought before, have we?

109
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,060
Do you know why?

110
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,690
-Because you’ve never been my match!
-Stop it...

111
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,090
Please...

112
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,230
Stop it...

113
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,440
Like I said at the start.

114
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:46,909
There'd be no need for us to fight
if you tell us Zeke's location.

115
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,880
So just come with us.

116
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,900
Take them.

117
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:51,820
Yes, sir.

118
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,860
And this brat who killed Sasha, too.

119
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,190
So...

120
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,590
What is it that you wanted
to say anyway?

121
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,410
Is hurting Mikasa the freedom you wanted?

122
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,160
Who is it?

123
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,630
Who is the real slave that
succumbed to a shitty bastard!

124
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,200
Who are you calling a slave?

125
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,630
Let's go.

126
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,520
To where?

127
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,240
To where everything began.

128
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,650
Shiganshina district.

129
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,700
This got to be a joke.

130
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,770
If it's about feeding someone to a Titan,
there's a better guy for it.

131
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,890
Eh?

132
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,590
What do you mean by that?

133
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,240
We will transfer Zeke's Beast
to someone else.

134
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:42,130
Turn one of those Yeagerists into
a Titan and feed Zeke to him.

135
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,490
I don't know if Eren is really
being controlled by Zeke.

136
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,950
But if they lose Zeke, they'll be done.

137
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,520
Tell Pixis that.

138
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,570
Go.

139
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,440
Are you serious, Captain?

140
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,490
If I rip this guy's limbs off, I'm sure
that geezer will get his shit straight.

141
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,580
Do you enjoy your book?

142
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,670
It's good, though it’s my
seventh time reading it.

143
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,440
I bet you couldn't concentrate
because of our conversation.

144
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,550
You're telling me to concentrate
on the book I've read for seven times?

145
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,920
By the way, do you still have
some wine left?

146
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,060
We've been here for a month.

147
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,800
There isn't a drop left.

148
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,680
Sheesh.

149
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,280
You guys sure thought up quite
a horrible torture.

150
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,400
Keep on reading.

151
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,690
Roger that, Boss.

152
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,930
Whatever Pixis says, I will slice him.

153
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,790
We have thirty fully armed soldiers
surrounding this forest from above.

154
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,380
Even if he transforms into a Beast Titan,
there's no escape for him.

155
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,260
This bearded bastard is our enemy all along.

156
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,750
Now that it's clear, there's no reason to
keep a hostage like him with his limbs on.

157
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,980
It has been long.

158
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,800
Erwin.

159
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,870
Looks like I can finally fulfill
the vow I made that time.

160
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,600
Your deaths meant something.

161
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,260
And finally, I'll be able to prove it.

162
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,760
Hey...

163
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,940
[The available intelligence for now]
[Spinal Fluid Wine]
[A Marleyan red wine mixed with Zeke 'Wonderboy' Yaeger's spinal fluid.]
[When drinking the wine, Subjects of Ymir consume Zeke's spinal fluid at the same time.]
[They will turn into Pure Titans and obey his orders]
[when hearing his 'scream'.]
[This is a cheap and effective way to conquer other nations.]

164
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,940
What was that?

165
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,380
My body went numb for a second.

166
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,600
-Me too.
-So did mine.

167
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,650
Eh? I didn't feel anything...

168
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,940
What's wrong?

169
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,210
It felt like electricity just ran
through my body.

170
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,670
Could it be...?

171
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,800
He really did it...

172
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,230
Zeke...

173
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,830
Farewell, Captain.

174
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,140
You're a caring leader.

175
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,610
You won't kill your innocent soldiers just
because they’ve grown a little bigger, right?

176
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,620
Wine?

177
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,590
Why do we need wine while on duty?

178
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,890
Captain!

179
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,240
This is rare Marleyan wine that only
the Military Police get to drink!

180
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,540
We deserve a little bit of fun.

181
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,870
We got black tea.

182
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,550
Captain!

183
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,200
What a pain.

184
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,830
Fine, take it.

185
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,090
Dammit!

186
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,150
Zeke's spinal fluid was in the wine?

187
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,900
When did he start all this?

188
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,200
There's no sign of them freezing up.

189
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,070
Was that one of his lies?

190
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,540
Dammit, so fast!

191
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,360
They're not moving like normal.

192
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,920
Is this also Zeke's doing?

193
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,150
Varis!

194
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,380
Are you still there?

195
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,760
My friends...

196
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,070
Time to say goodbye.

197
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,410
We couldn't trust each other.

198
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,230
The entire world's forces are about
to gather here on this island.

199
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,370
You have no idea what it means.

200
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,460
You thought you had strength,
time, and choices.

201
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,460
The reason why you have
these misunderstandings...

202
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,550
Levi, it was your fault.

203
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,060
Well...

204
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,880
It's not like you will understand
my true goal even if I tell you.

205
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,450
Hey, Eren.

206
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,640
Only you and I can understand.

207
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,480
Once I'm out of this forest,
I'll be there by your side soon.

208
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:46,080
Though, I wonder if you still remember
the place and time we agreed on.

209
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,340
Eren.

210
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,000
Go!

211
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,320
Oh, come on!

212
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,360
Not again!

213
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,540
Where are you?!

214
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,080
Where are you, Levi?!

215
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,070
There you are!

216
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,510
What happened to your adorable soldiers?!

217
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,730
Don't tell me, you killed them?

218
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,760
Poor things!

219
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,970
Branches?!

220
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,440
You're desperate, you bearded bastard.

221
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,260
All you had to do
was to sit and read books.

222
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,910
Since when did you get the wrong idea...

223
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,770
...that you can run away from me?

224
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,680
You really think I wouldn't kill my comrades
just because you turned them into Titans?

225
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:22,620
You didn't even know just how many
friends we've had to kill!

226
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,760
Hey there, bearded bastard.

227
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:59,880
Look at you, you stink,
filthy, ugly piece of shit.

228
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,050
You shit!

229
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,530
Oh well, don't worry.
I won't kill you.

230
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,070
Not yet.

231
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,560
As you already know, the Supreme
Commander Zackly's assassination

232
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,710
has destabilized the military and
the state of affairs within the walls.

233
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,500
But that has nothing to do with you recruits.

234
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,880
The 109th Training Corps will
operate as planned,

235
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,060
and practice defending Shiganshina district
in the case of a Titan attack.

236
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,510
Do you understand?!

237
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,700
Y-Yes, sir!

238
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,630
They're still making us practice
cutting a Titan's nape with a blade?

239
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,950
It's not like we will get
attacked by Titans anymore.

240
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,300
We're up against humans
outside the wall, you know?

241
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,010
My dad also told me
that we should be training

242
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,600
how to use guns and form
an Eldian army instead.

243
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,300
Times have changed.

244
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,480
Instructor Shadis is stuck in the past.

245
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:04,700
If there's any hope for Eldia, that would be
when the Yeagerist seizes the power.

246
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,510
Surma, he will hear you.

247
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,829
But doesn't everyone feel that way?

248
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,630
All of us should want Eren
Yeager to lead Eldia.

249
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,730
We need a strong leader who's
capable of making the hard decisions.

250
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,690
Wha--

251
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,970
Hange?!

252
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,390
Long time no see, Instructor.

253
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:33,550
Sorry to interrupt, but we've
occupied the facility.

254
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,440
We, whom you call the
"Yeagerists," I believe?

255
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,660
You'll be following our orders.

256
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,770
Yeagerists...

257
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,350
You seem to know your place well, Floch.

258
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:52,030
If you see yourselves as a bunch of pissants

259
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,550
who need to wave guns around to get anyone
to bother with them, then spot on--

260
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,790
Floch?!

261
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,150
I missed.

262
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,440
I thought I'd speed things up
by shooting him in the foot.

263
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,380
What do you want to say?

264
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,950
No, it has nothing do to with you.

265
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,020
We don't need old and useless men whose
trait is just being hard-headed.

266
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,400
From now on...

267
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,640
All you cadets! This is your time!

268
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:31,460
We Yeagerists have dedicated our hearts to save
Eldia that is on the verge of destruction!

269
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:37,810
Not for this outdated military,
but for the people on this island!

270
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,420
If you continue to subordinate
yourselves to the obsolete military,

271
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,990
you'll only be able to watch helplessly
as our enemies from outside trample over us!

272
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,150
I ask all of you!

273
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,250
What are you?

274
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,920
Will you live in the future with
Eren Yeager, the leader of Eldia?!

275
00:18:55,180 --> 00:19:01,710
Or will you die here with Keith
Shadis and his old ways?!

276
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:12,450
We dedicate our hearts
for the future Eldia!

277
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,750
Good!

278
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,900
Then show me your resolve!

279
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:20,000
Beat Instructor Shadis
until he can no longer stand!

280
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:21,750
What?

281
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:26,830
He represents the vices
that we must weed out!

282
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,670
Purge him!

283
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,560
Anyone who can't will be detained!

284
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,760
Enough, Floch!

285
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,390
Don't be stupid!

286
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,690
Hange.

287
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:42,720
All these children would
be no match for me!

288
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,780
You did well.

289
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,850
We welcome all of you.

290
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,600
Now then, show us the way.

291
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,540
To where Zeke's being held.

292
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,880
Commander Hange.

293
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,900
Hey, let's go.

294
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,120
You awake?

295
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,090
Hey, wait.

296
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,400
Don't move.

297
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:39,260
There's a wire connected to the detonator
of that Thunder Spear right around your neck.

298
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,870
One false move, and you'll explode from
the stomach outward,

299
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,970
leaving you in two pieces at least.

300
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,160
It sure is tough not being able
to die at times like this.

301
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,570
Not that I sympathize with you.

302
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,710
You toyed with the lives of my soldiers.

303
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,940
Is it also part of your plan to end up
sobbing and being covered in your own filth?

304
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,900
Shut up.

305
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,330
If I don't cut you like this,

306
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,580
you will turn into a Titan again!

307
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,530
Where are... my... glasses?

308
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,280
Huh? How would I know?

309
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,220
You don't need glasses anymore.

310
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,270
Nice, Zeke.

311
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,870
You are becoming a better player.

312
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,820
Going to be a baseball player
when you grow up?

313
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,560
I can't...

314
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,640
Mr. Ksaver...

315
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,770
Because I... have... a mission.
