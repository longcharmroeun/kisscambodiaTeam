2
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,590
Hey…


3
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,670
It's dangerous here…


4
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,660
Fly away…


5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,530
To somewhere… far away…


6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,270
Falco!


7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,730
Eh? Brother… what's wrong?


8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,840
Good! If you can still talk, then you're all okay!


9
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,990
Colt!


10
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,520
I'm running! Hold on tight!


11
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,450
Falco!


12
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,940
Colt, how's the situation?!


13
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,580
The Eldian unit on the front line…


14
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,690
took a direct shell hit and was blown away…


15
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,930
And the trenches?


16
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,170
It's impossible to dig any further!


17
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,490
Impossible?


18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,039
Is that an order?


19
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,430
You, an Eldian, is giving me order?


20
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,630
Hey! You!
Watch your mouth in front of Commander Magath!


21
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,420
But… at this rate…


22
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,380
Falco, are you drunk?


23
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,370
He must've hit his head.


24
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:34,340
We've been at war for four years, do you remember?


25
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,690
Who are… you guys…?


26
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,229
Or more like… eh?


27
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,280
Wasn't there a group of people jumping
around wielding a sword?


28
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,720
Like, swoosh…They took down a Titan


29
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,039
Looks like we need to
explain the operation to you again.


30
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:56,000
Just listen to me, Falco.


31
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,970
This war that has consumed our last four years…
It's finally going to an end.


32
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,830
All we have to do is to take control of Fort Slava.


33
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,380
Well, to be precise,
we have to sink the Mid-East Allied Forces' fleet


34
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,150
in the naval station below it.


35
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,340
Once we do that, we, the Marley, will win this war.


36
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:21,020
But to do that, we must take control Fort Slava
that defends the high ground.


37
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,530
Otherwise, we can't attack the station.


38
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,900
Can't the Marley navy attack them
from the sea for us?


39
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,410
Zofia?! Do you really think we can count
on that Navy to do something for us?!


40
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,320
They're the cesspool of incompetence


41
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,060
that took four whole years
to take control of the seas!


42
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:35,720
That hurts!


43
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,980
It took them half of the battleships
we have for them


44
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,060
to accomplish that!


45
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,130
Yet, they have the nerve to tell us


46
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,890
to capture a fort for them
before they can do a thing!


47
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,500
Those bastards! Do you understand?!!!


48
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,000
Udo, you're going to rip Falco's head off.


49
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,960
Ah! Sorry, sorry!


50
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,020
So,


51
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,070
why did they send warrior cadets like us


52
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,820
to the frontline?


53
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,110
It's to test us.


54
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,160
To see who is it among us…
that will become the next Warrior.


55
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,400
The "time" is near.


56
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,610
Commander Magath has decided this


57
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,690
to be our final exam.


58
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,210
In preparation for what's coming next,


59
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,440
he will choose who gets to play an important role
on the plan to suppress the Paradis island.


60
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,670
The heir to the Armored Titan.

74
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,310
Who will get chosen, I wonder.


75
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,540
Well, Gabi.


76
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,690
You made it sound like no one but you


77
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,680
could possibly be chosen.


78
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,680
I mean, who else?


79
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,170
True, we're not much compared to Gabi.


80
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,820
Considering the grades, yeah.


81
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,690
No, it's not about the grades, Udo.


82
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,140
Aren't I always telling you that?


83
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:37,830
The thing that separates me from you guys…
it's my resolve.


84
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,610
The resolve to shoulder the fate of all Eldian


85
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,230
and kill every demon living in that island


86
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,750
who've caused us so much suffering.


87
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,190
To prove that
the only remaining Eldians are the good ones,


88
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,310
I will win this fight
and show it to the rest of the world.


89
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,960
I won't lose.


90
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,120
I will free everyone from the internment zone.


91
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,890
So…


92
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,530
What have you been fiddling with all this time?


93
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,250
This? Cool, right?


94
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,240
Why, Commander Magath?!


95
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,810
It's impossible for infantry like us


96
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,850
to destroy the tracks
behind that machine gun on our own.


97
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,860
They have eyes all along that trench,


98
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,400
there isn't a single crack in their defenses…


99
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,220
On top of that,
they have artillery supporting them from the fort.


100
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,490
If we stay here,


101
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,780
they will just start raining shells down our heads.


102
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,300
Sounds like you have an idea, Colt.


103
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,170
Let's have Jaws and Cart go loose here.


104
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,670
Galliard and Pieck should be able to do it.


105
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,170
They'd be able to wipe out the enemies
in the pillbox and the trench in an instant.


106
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,260
No.


107
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,930
We’ll lose if we play our cards in the wrong order.


108
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,210
Commander Magath. It's here.


109
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,480
What is it?


110
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,810
It.


111
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,850
The Armored Train.


112
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:03,690
It has total four guns on its front and back cars.
The allies' new weapon;


113
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,250
the Anti-Titan Artillery.


114
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,350
The 100mm armor-piercing shells they fire


115
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,770
would stop a titan in one shot.


116
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,290
Even one of the Nine.


117
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,690
But, both of our titans are quick.


118
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,810
It couldn't possibly hit their nape.


119
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,010
But what if it does?


120
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,670
We… will lose the power of a Titan,
as well as a Warrior


121
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:29,170
and there's no guarantee
that we'll be able to regain it.


122
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,380
That's right.


123
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,530
Just like how our plan to regain the Founder


124
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,250
launched nine years ago failed


125
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,020
and we lost the Colossal and the Female


126
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,990
as a result.


127
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,440
Our enemies perceived it
as a blow to our military strength,


128
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,290
and it becomes the trigger to the war
that continues to this day,


129
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,170
thus delaying our Paradis operation.


130
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,570
What is it that makes our homeland Marley
the great empire it is today?


131
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,200
It's the power of the Titan.


132
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,200
That's right.


133
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,250
If we lose any more of it, this country
won't be able to sustain itself any longer.


134
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,680
The power of the Titans is absolute.
That is our axiom.


135
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,280
Prepare the Eldian unit to charge.


136
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,060
Roger.


137
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,980
Commander Magath! That's…!


138
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,960
What is it, Eldian?


139
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,340
Aren't you all Warriors
who have pledged your loyalty to Marley?


140
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,680
This is your chance to be honored
by our motherland.


141
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,590
All eight hundred Eldians here.


142
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:37,720
Stand, all of you! Prepare to charge!


143
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,510
Come on, stand up!


144
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,420
Now, you Eldian unit


145
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,110
will charge straight at enemy's tracks
and crush them!


146
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:54,130
The death squad will jump into the enemy's bunker
and neutralize their machine guns!


147
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,480
Listen well!


148
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,880
This is a chance for you disgusting descendant
of devil to clear your name!


149
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,290
A wonderful opportunity for you
to be honored by our motherland Marley!


150
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,540
Give it your best!


151
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,530
Roger!


152
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,640
You warrior cadets stand by here.


153
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,580
The Eldian unit's charge must destroy
those tracks no matter what.


154
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,790
As long that


155
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:22,150
Armored Train prowls around the fort,


156
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,020
neither the Armored nor the Beast
can be called upon here.


157
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,600
But still…


158
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,470
Colt. If you would inherit the Beast,


159
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,110
you should show that you're prepared to be a leader.


160
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,310
Nice.


161
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,560
It's a chance to blow the tracks along
with the train.


162
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,140
Can you let me do it?


163
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,080
Tadaa!


164
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,630
I can neutralize the Armored Train all by myself.


165
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,000
Hey, Gabi…


166
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,660
Do you have any idea how much it
cost the country to train you bunch?


167
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,590
Denied.


168
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,650
True, I am a gifted talent,


169
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,940
unlike the rest of them.


170
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:14,540
And I doubt you will find another warrior
as exceptional as me.


171
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,740
I'm super cute, too.


172
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,830
However, if I succeed,


173
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,890
we can get through this
without losing eight hundred Eldian soldiers.


174
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,610
And if you fail?


175
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:28,440
You will lose one exceptional warrior cadet


176
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,130
and seven hand grenades.


177
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,300
But, if you consider me to worth more


178
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,370
than eight hundred Eldian soldiers


179
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,620
it can't be helped.


180
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,210
If you're willing to sacrifice
eight hundred soldiers


181
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,590
because you love me so much, then I--


182
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,640
Fine.


183
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,030
Go.


184
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,300
No. - Gabi…


185
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:58,470
I promise! I will prove you that I'm a warrior
worthy of inheriting the Armored Titan!


186
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,690
What are you doing?


187
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,290
It's for the plan to work.


188
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,450
Please allow me to take off my armband,
just for now.


189
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,950
You may.


190
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,060
Hey. Someone is coming. Alone.


191
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,150
It's a girl… a young one at that.


192
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,210
Seems like she's coming to surrender.


193
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,350
No, wait.


194
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,130
She could be an Eldian.


195
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,650
But still, she looks strange.


196
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,780
It looks like she's dragging a pair
of shackles on her leg.


197
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,320
She's close. She must be an Eldian.


198
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,110
Shoot her before she turns into a Titan.


199
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,480
Don't be silly. Your rifle should do the trick.


200
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,340
Shit.


201
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,880
What is it?


202
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,600
Not yet…


203
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,620
Not yet…


204
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,450
Not yet…!


205
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,060
She's moving.


206
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,500
Don't mind her, just shoot.


207
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,990
Now…!!!


208
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,670
She did it!


209
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,170
Galliard! Get ready!


210
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,860
Dammit… those Marley cowards!


211
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:56,850
This is why… we must…
not let you get with what you want!


212
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,550
Gabi!


213
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,910
Falco, no!


214
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,190
Galliard!


215
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,020
We have confirmed that the Armored Train
is out of commission.


216
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,050
The airborne operation will now begin.


217
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,300
Be sure to stick to the plan.


218
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,280
Zeke will be our spear,


219
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,850
and Reiner will be our shield.


220
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:55,800
[Known Information Military Power Marley Led by Helos who ended the war Marley becomes a rejuvenated super power. With seven titans of the Nine as their warriors, it keeps invading other countries. In addition, it also has the Army, the Navy and Air Force made up of airships. So it’s stronger than any other country.]


221
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:56,980
That hurts!


222
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,610
Why is a Marley like me getting shot?


223
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,040
-What are you doing, Falco?
-Eldian should be at the forefront!


224
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,450
Can't you tell?


225
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,400
He can't fight anymore, he's our prisoner.


226
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,760
Udo, give me the tourniquet.


227
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,410
Here.


228
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,770
Damn kids, forget about him. He's an enemy.


229
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:15,540
Is that supposed to be your strong suit?


230
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,250
You're trying to overshadow me
by adhering to the international law,


231
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,710
believing it will get you chosen
to inherent the Armored?


232
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,480
It doesn't seem to be working, though.


233
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,950
Hell if I care.


234
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,850
Weirdo.


235
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,310
He's saying something.


236
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,090
Can you translate for me, Udo?


237
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,460
Tell him his bleeding is settling down,
so he can just relax.


238
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,500
"Don't touch me."


239
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,370
"You filthy."


240
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,660
"Devil."


241
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:47,990
That's what he said.


242
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,320
Retreat!


243
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,590
Hurry up!


244
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,360
Get away from the fortress!


245
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,690
Don't get caught in it!


246
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,060
It started.


247
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,420
No! Stop it!


248
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,680
They truly are… devils.


249
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,990
So our Marleyan ancestors…


250
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,600
were eaten up that way, too, huh.


251
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,360
By you Eldians.


252
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,050
Fire!


253
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,410
The kinetic bombardment was sufficient.


254
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,530
But due to excessive altitude,


255
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,310
about half of them died from falling.


256
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:20,080
Many of the Anti-Titan artillery
are still functional.


257
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,280
Twenty eight… twenty nine…


258
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,260
Location and number confirmed.


259
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,730
But still…


260
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,130
A wall again?


261
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,540
I'm sick of walls already!


262
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,490
It's the Armored!


263
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,600
Kill him!


264
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,240
Fire!


265
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,590
The Anti-Titan shells…


266
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,550
So it can even pierce my armor?


267
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,190
What? What just hit me?


268
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,210
Armored Train?


269
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:23,610
There's still more of it?


270
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,690
Fire


271
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,150
Galliard!


272
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,910
You descendants of whore!


273
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:27,990
Good.


274
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,490
So, you've subdued them all…


275
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:42,960
Our defeat caused this war, Reiner.


276
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,530
Isn’t war a terrible thing?


277
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,260
Now, at last… this war will end.


278
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,540
With the annihilation of their fleet,


279
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,540
the Mid-East Allied Forces
signed a peace treaty with Marley.


280
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,080
The four-year long war


281
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,380
