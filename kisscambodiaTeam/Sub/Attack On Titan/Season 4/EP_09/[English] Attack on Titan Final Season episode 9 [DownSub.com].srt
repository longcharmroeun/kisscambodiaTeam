2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,270
I'm sure you are tired of hearing this,


3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,260
but I want you to listen.


4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,660
It was three years ago.


5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,190
Maybe we could've changed
something at that time.


6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,220
(Three years ago)


7
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,160
Captain.


8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,420
Two hours have passed since the advance
team landed, but no news from them.


9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,280
Prepare survey units 2
and 3 for landing now.


10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,290
Yes, sir!


11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,000
The island of devils that defeated
our warrior unit and threatens the world.


12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,940
We must bring back whatever information
we can get back to Marley.


13
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,210
Hold on tight!


14
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,480
The devil...!


15
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,380
Hello, ladies and gentlemen of Marley!


16
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,130
Welcome to Paradis island!


17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,180
I am Hange.


18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,350
I'm here to welcome our distinguished
guests who've travelled a long way here!


19
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:26,380
Please, come here and enjoy
some tea and relax.


20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,530
By the way, I’ve become a friend


21
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,950
with one guest who arrived earlier.


22
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,930
Isn't that right, Niccolo?


23
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,780
Captain!


24
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,700
Don't mind me!
Just shoot these devils already!


25
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,490
Wha-!


26
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,340
-Just what are you saying, Niccolo?
-Captain!


27
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,380
He's clearly not interested in
playing along with your stupid skit.


28
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,830
Niccolo..!


29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,100
Listen up, you damn devils!


30
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,580
Marley lean no ears to the words
of those with defiled blood!


31
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,220
We have no interest in drinking pig piss
with you tarnished bastards!


32
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,910
Ooooh!? Oooh!


33
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,210
Are you sure you want to
insult us like that?!


34
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,580
Can't you see the titan standing behind you?


35
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,000
We will not bend to the power of devils!


36
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,940
This is our greeting to you!


37
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,110
What're you doing, Yelena?!


38
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,020
Throw your weapon away.


39
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,640
You guys...


40
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,640
Do as she said.


41
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,130
Hange, we're honored to receive
your invitation.


42
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,470
Let's have that tea.


43
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,329
I've always wanted to meet you.


44
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,560
Eren.

(#68 Volunteer)


56
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,640
That tall, skinny woman just shot
her own ally to death.


57
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,250
What did she do that for?


58
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,480
Beats me.


59
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,780
Be she's on our side nor not,
it's clear we can't trust her either way.


60
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,450
Sasha, don't sleep.


61
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:47,480
But we're fortunate to be able to
talk and gain intelligence from them.


62
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,210
-Yeah, we're really lucky.
-Tell me about it.


63
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,909
It was by pure chance that we
were able to stop them from landing.


64
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,960
If Marley were intended to send out troops,
it’d be a much more massive scale..


65
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,110
We must think of something about it.


66
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,520
Oh, I see.


67
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,250
So you can shoot multiple
times with this.


68
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,280
Those are Marleyan soldiers'
standard equipment.


69
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,520
Each Marleyan's army divisions
consists of about 20,000 soldiers.


70
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,260
There are 50 divisions in total,
making around a million of them.


71
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,730
In addition to that,


72
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,170
they possess three fleets
consisting of 21 battle ships.


73
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,270
They've also seen incredible
progress in new weapons R&D,


74
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,970
as well as in aerial military capabilities.


75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,750
...Aerial?


76
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,680
Don't look so surprised.
They will look down on us.


77
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,050
I know that!


78
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,300
In other words,


79
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,330
mobile weapons that can go beyond seas
and walls, and drop the enemy from the sky.


80
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,840
They'll come from the sky?!


81
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,510
Hey!


82
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,280
Marley has all that wonderful power,


83
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,659
yet they haven't launched a proper attack
on us for almost a year. Why is that?


84
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,150
There are two main reasons.


85
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,930
The first reason is the Pure Titans
that they unleashed on this island.


86
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,140
Their existence makes it hard for them
to get here, even with the latest weapons.


87
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,470
It was originally a policy meant
to confine the Eldians inside the walls.


88
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,990
However, it ended up one of the reasons
that kept Eldian from Marley’s attack.


89
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,690
Seems like it.
Quite ironic, I must say.


90
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:25,750
However, the day is about to break.
The Titans should be active soon.


91
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,100
Yet, we're still leisurely drinking tea
here outside the wall.


92
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,690
That means you have killed
all the pure titans on the island.


93
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,030
Is that correct?


94
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,500
So what? Will you manage
to inform Marley of it?


95
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,930
No, it's wonderful.


96
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,230
Way beyond what I expected.


97
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,220
What's the second reason?


98
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,540
Marley is currently in a state
of war with multiple countries.


99
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,659
In other words, they’ve got
a bigger issue to deal with.


100
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:03,040
You guys have defeated Marley's
trusted Warrior unit.


101
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,060
You guys also took the Colossal Titan
and the Female Titan-their key weapons.


102
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,250
Marley is a country with many enemies.


103
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,380
So other countries came together in
a blink of an eye and then the war began.


104
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:22,030
So that means you guys are
seeking revenge for your defeat, .


105
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,000
so you infiltrated the army as
some sort of intelligence agent?


106
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,580
I’m right, aren’t I?


107
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:34,060
As I thought, you guys must have convincing enough
motive and backers to betray Marley like that.


108
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,320
Calling us an "intelligence agent"
would be an overstatement.


109
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:45,900
We lost our homeland to Marley and
joined their army as conscripts. We're weak.


110
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,960
We also start to lose hope of
opposing such a big nation.


111
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,760
It is until he became our leader.


112
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,470
Marley and the world fear
the Titans and regard them as devils.


113
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,930
However, I think differently of them.


114
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,930
They are Gods…


115
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:09,540
They gave us hope
when we were at our weakest.


116
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:17,150
We shot our superior under
the orders of Zeke Yeager.


117
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,170
We're the Anti-Marleyan Volunteers.


118
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,660
Our goal is to free the Eldian people.


119
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,770
That would be Zeke Yeager's request.


120
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,880
All of this would be done to rescue
the Eldian people who are in…


121
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,980
Nonsense!


122
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,970
Who would accept such a ridiculous offer!


123
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,020
We're talking about the Beast Titan here!


124
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:42,110
He turned the people of Ragako into Titans
and spread terror inside the walls!


125
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:47,240
He's the very person who nearly killed the entire
Survey Corps, yet he's sending out a request?!


126
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,610
Their objective has always been
to retake the Founding Titan.


127
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:56,530
If force doesn't work, they will
use any other means at their disposal.


128
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,470
Our enemies must be aware of our thoughts.


129
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,610
Why don’t we listen to Commander first?


130
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:09,080
According to Zeke, they have a "secret plan"
that can solve all Eldian's problems at once.


131
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:15,380
What he needs to carry out that plan are
the Founding Titan and a Titan with royal blood.


132
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,570
The world can be saved
if he has those two things.


133
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,290
However...


134
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:24,580
He can only reveal this secret plan
after those conditions are met.


135
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,790
I can't listen anymore.


136
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,360
They sure think of us as fools.


137
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,580
Eren?


138
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,210
That's true.


139
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,980
I remember.


140
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,950
There was one time I was able to activate
the powers of the Founding Titan.


141
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,670
It was in the moment I touched
a Titan with royal blood.


142
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,500
I’m sure that Titan was
my father's former wife, Dina Fritz.


143
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,410
Zeke is Dina's son, so he must've
figured it out somehow.


144
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,750
The means of overcoming
the vow renouncing the war.


145
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:00,130
The only hope left for us Eldians.


146
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:05,350
The way of trampling the world using
thousands of titans inside the walls...


147
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,480
The condition to activate the Rumbling.


148
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,200
You...


149
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,910
Why didn't you tell us that until now?


150
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,040
Because I was concerned about Historia.


151
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,960
I can't allow her to become a Titan
based on my uncertain information.


152
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,700
I admit it was a thoughtless decision.


153
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,500
We will talk more about that later.


154
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,420
But, if that's really true...


155
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,470
Zeke's secret plan would make sense.


156
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,120
Are you serious? You really trust them?!


157
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,070
That's right!


158
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:40,400
Who knows what would happen if we left
those enemy soldiers on the island!


159
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,030
We should hang them all to death!


160
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,290
No, we can't do that.


161
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:51,560
We need those volunteers if we want to
protect this island from Marley's survey boats.


162
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,670
Without their "wireless communication,"
then we....


163
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,310
This is survey fleet 1.


164
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,160
Come in.


165
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,540
This is survey fleet 1.


166
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,080
This is survey fleet 2.


167
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,730
Thank goodness! Our boat ran aground...


168
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,160
We have been waiting
for help all this time.


169
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,010
We will head right away.


170
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,970
In that inlet, right?


171
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,340
Our numbers?


172
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,140
Rest assured. We're heading there
with two survey ships.


173
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,020
Hey, are you okay?


174
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,660
Everything is fine now!


175
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,270
The Colossal Titan!


176
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,220
Why?!


177
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,520
Hey!


178
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,290
That's the enemy!


179
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,600
Hurry! Jump into the sea!


180
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,740
Get out of there!


181
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,280
Jump! Now!


182
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,440
Welcome to our filthy island,
home to defiled devils.


183
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,630
We’ll receive you well!


184
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,660
As long as you like pig piss.


185
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,690
We won't mind if you refuse,
but we also won't let you come ashore.


186
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,810
I'm sorry, but you'll need
to swim back home.


187
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,600
It was fun back then.


188
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:04,500
We Eldians indeed are
feared and hated by the world.


189
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,240
By the people on the other side
of the sea who have never even met us.


190
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:14,950
But not everyone on the other side
of the sea is our enemy.


191
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,230
We find that the world is much
more complicated than we thought.


192
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,920
It's full of things we don't know.


193
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,490
By the way, why's your skin is
so dark, Onyankopon?


194
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,150
He who made us once thought,


195
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,060
“wouldn't it be interesting if there
were more than one kind of people out there?”


196
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,560
The same goes to the subjects
of Ymir like you guys.


197
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,360
All of us exist because
someone wanted us to exist.


198
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,780
Then who made us?


199
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,950
The being that granted power
to the founder Ymir.


200
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,000
It’s God.


201
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,050
There are those who think like that.


202
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,560
They have right to believe
whatever they want.


203
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,840
What is this food?


204
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,020
Is this stuff edible?


205
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,250
Looks raw.


206
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,300
First time having seafood?


207
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,040
Niccolo is a master of
Marleyan cooking.


208
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,240
Dammit.


209
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,150
If you don't like it, stop eating,
you Eldians.


210
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,230
There's no food for…


211
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,370
-Yum!
-That's unfair, Sasha!


212
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,060
Mr. Niccolo, you're a genius!


213
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,700
Watch your manners!


214
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,910
I've never had something like this.


215
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,640
There's more. Take it slow.


216
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,250
The port will be done soon.


217
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,860
The progress has been so fast ever since
those Marleyan engineers decided to help.


218
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,970
I'm surprised they would
agree to do so.


219
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:03,660
Sure, we both were suspicious of each
other at first and it didn't go so smoothly.


220
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:10,310
But once time passed and we started to
look at each other as a person, not title...


221
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,810
I'm sure we can understand each other.


222
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:15,970
Armin.


223
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,180
Did you see anything from
Bertolt's memory?


224
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
Eh? Well...


225
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,260
No, nothing useful.


226
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,050
We don't have much time.


227
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,990
Zeke only has three years
left to live.


228
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,270
Yeah, and about that.


229
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:35,100
Is it really okay for us to keep
carrying on Yelena's plan?


230
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,100
Is there any problem?


231
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,720
Is threatening the world with Rumbling really
the only way to protect the Eldian people?


232
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,340
That’d drag the entire world into a nightmare.


233
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,890
Can't we just talk it through
before that?


234
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,030
If we can resolve our misunderstanding
by speaking to Marley and the world...


235
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,290
Misunderstanding?


236
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,620
What misunderstanding?


237
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,530
You know, people think we're scary.


238
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,560
According to the world, we're monsters
who can turn into a titan.


239
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,390
That’s not a misunderstanding.


240
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,680
But there are Marleyans
who’ve become friends with us..


241
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,910
How many?


242
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,490
Most Marleyan soldiers are glaring
at us from the prison cell, no?


243
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,470
I'm sure if we have more time, we can...


244
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,530
Yeah.


245
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,560
We need time.


246
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,280
Yes.


247
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,420
And to buy that time...


248
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,780
...we must make sure they
can't do anything to us.


249
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,460
Is what we're doing
really the right thing?


250
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,880
Maybe there could be another way.


251
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,310
I can't stop thinking about that.


252
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,970
I thought I knew about Eren
more than anyone else.


253
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,310
Even more than Mikasa.


254
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,640
But... I don't know anymore.


255
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,440
Hey!


256
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,030
You're Marleyan, right?


257
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,080
What are you coming here for?!


258
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,380
What business do you have at
a graveyard of the Eldian killed by Marley?!


259
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,530
Please wait!


260
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,620
Please let us!


261
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,020
We will take care of him!


262
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,440
I beg you, please.


263
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,760
Don't get so close with an Marleyan!


264
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,130
Hey, Niccolo.


265
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,380
Are you okay?


266
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,270
Dammit!


267
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,590
Why?


268
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,540
Did Sasha really die?


269
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,970
Tell me.


270
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,400
Why?


271
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,360
What were you guys doing?!


272
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,820
They said she got shot by
a girl who snuck into the airship.


273
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,320
How could that possibly happen?


274
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,410
It was not just an ordinary girl.


275
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,810
She'd been trained.


276
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,930
A warrior candidate?


277
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,020
I also let my guard down.


278
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,310
I'm sorry.


279
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,970
Why are you apologizing to me?


280
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,390
All I did was cooking for you guys.


281
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:25,569
Thank you for feeding
her so much good food.


282
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,220
Niccolo.


283
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,480
How did you feel, Connie?


284
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:36,120
Sasha and I were like twins.


285
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,330
It's like I'm losing half of myself.


286
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,450
You are?


287
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,040
Thank you for taking care of my daughter.


288
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,970
Umm, sir?


289
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,170
I'm just a captive Marleyan.


290
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,490
But I have permission to work as a chef.


291
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,790
Your daughter enjoyed my food
more than anyone else did.


292
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,730
That's why...


293
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,770
If you don't mind...


294
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,990
Please come and taste my cooking.


295
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,060
For free, right?


296
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,270
Yes!


297
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,210
So your reports say you were victorious?


298
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,020
Ignorance sure is frightening.


299
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:44,540
I can kill you right now and send your
corpse to Marley in order to reveal your scheme.


300
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,250
I bet it will spell an end
to your grandparents.


301
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,010
But if this "secret plan" of yours is real,


302
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,520
I can wait a bit longer before
slicing you into pieces.


303
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,150
I don't mind either way.


304
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:59,700
I'm grateful for your generous words.


305
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,610
But shouldn't you let me meet Eren first?


306
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,320
Why the hurry?


307
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,790
I already prepared a high class
hotel for you to stay for the night.


308
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,760
You can take a nice rest there, first.


309
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:18,690
Say... can you stop glaring me like that?


310
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:23,520
This is all the Titan transformation
serum we stole from Marley.


311
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,750
However, duplicating them
will be difficult.


312
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,470
No, this ought to be enough.


313
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,710
We can't thank you enough for this.


314
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:40,220
You guys have done so much for us,
guiding us from ignorance to hope.


315
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,460
Only devils would doubt
their own saviors.


316
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,010
Over these past three years,


317
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:52,170
we thought we've done enough to
prove that we're friends with the Eldian.


318
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,900
But it's unfortunate.


319
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:59,840
Those guns we brought were meant
to bring freedom to the Eldian.


320
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,920
I'm sorry for our selfishness.


321
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:06,860
But please overlook our weakness
for the time being.


322
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:10,570
We have no choice but to put
shackles on Zeke.


323
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,610
I don't mind, Commander Pixis.


324
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,190
The day will soon come when
we can sit at the same dinner table again.


325
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,880
This is the hotel I'm staying?


326
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,270
Do you have any complaints?


327
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,100
It's the forest of great trees.


328
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,260
There's no better place than this for you to stay.


329
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,960
Looks like I can have a lot of fun
with vertical maneuver equipment here.


330
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,410
What do you say, Captain Levi?


331
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,650
I'd like to show Gabi and Falco
this vast wilderness as well.


332
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:45,890
Whether or not those brats get
to see this vast wilderness is up to you.


333
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,730
Eren... Yeager!


334
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,450
Eren was ready to do this,
even by himself.


335
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,980
Whether we help him or
abandon him...


336
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,200
it would have ended awfully
either way.


337
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,040
But now we've killed a lot of people.


338
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:15,390
We’ve got the battleship, soldiers,
and civilians involved.


339
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,720
And took everything away
from them out of nowhere.


340
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:23,430
However, if that military port
is still operating...


341
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:27,510
Marley would launch an
immediate counter-attack on this island any time.


342
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,540
We lost our hope for peace.


343
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,500
So we have no other choice but this.


344
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,790
Just like you guys that day.


345
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,820
Please, Annie...


346
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,380
Tell us something.


347
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,280
If we lose, we die.


348
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,230
If we win, we live.


349
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,330
We can't win if we don't fight.


350
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,070
Fight.


351
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:06,970
Fight.


352
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,970
♫ In an instant ♫


353
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:24,970
♫ In an abandoned world ♫


354
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:36,150
♫ If you can’t fly, please tell him ♫


355
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:45,580
♫ Many birds with burnt wings ♫


356
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:52,250
♫ Scattering ashes and smiling ♫


357
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:58,760
♫ I wish someone ♫


358
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:04,890
♫ Spreading the proof of my existence ♫


359
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:19,110
♫ Even if my body turns into ashes
I will be immortal ♫


360
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:34,710
♫ Even if my body turns into ashes
I will be immortal ♫


361
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:43,850
There is no ally in the outside world.


362
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,060
That's why we must destroy all
of our enemy to survive.


363
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,950
No one knows whether that
is truly the right answer.


364
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,970
