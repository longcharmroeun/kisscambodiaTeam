2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,700
Gabi! Hey! What's wrong?!

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,600
Hey! Get hold of yourself!

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,240
What's wrong? What happened?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,570
She suddenly started wailing in pain.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,540
Hey, young miss, are you okay?

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,630
Gabi, that's enough!

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,710
What’s your purpose of
running away from here?

9
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,820
They would kill us eventually.

10
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,500
That person is worried about you.

11
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,760
How can you trust those devils?

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,990
We can't trust Zeke either.

13
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,880
I trust no one!

14
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,810
Bad dreams?

15
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,390
If only it had all been just a dream.

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,880
I heard Gabi and Falco's voices.

17
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,820
Where are they now?

(#70 Counterfeit)

29
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,150
We've made it pretty far.

30
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,280
We’ve been running all night, after all.

31
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,120
Hey.

32
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,820
You should take off your armband.

33
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,750
It’ll give us away.

34
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,190
Regular citizens won't recognize
this armband anyway.

35
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,280
But the soldiers would.

36
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,880
Just take it off already.

37
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,390
There are no soldiers
in a rural countryside like this.

38
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,970
If you keep it on, people
will find out sooner or later.

39
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,810
We don't have any clue
on how to get back to Marley.

40
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,640
It’s impossible to get back.

41
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:23,010
I just want to find Zeke and confront
him before I'm captured and killed.

42
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,930
I wanna ask him if he really betrayed us…and Marley,

43
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,730
and why he did that!

44
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,220
You can do whatever you want.

45
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,480
You don't have to come along with me.

46
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,260
Is that so?

47
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,110
I’ll take your advice, then.

48
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,030
I will toss this away for you.

49
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,480
Give it back!

50
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,180
Ugh!

51
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,850
What are you doing?

52
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,790
This thing is useless in here!

53
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,250
I'm a good Eldian!

54
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,140
Without that, I'm no different
from these island devils!

55
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,670
What are you talking about?

56
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,320
Have you gone crazy?!

57
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,070
Then leave me alone!

58
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,570
Why... did you follow me?

59
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,390
There is no reason for you to die.

60
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,100
What are you two doing?

61
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,210
It's so early in the morning.

62
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,730
Where did you two come from?

63
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,750
I... don't want to say it.

64
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:22,330
We were tired of staying at home.

65
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,910
We finally managed to run away and get here...

66
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,100
That's why...

67
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,070
We can't go back now.

68
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,450
I see.

69
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,159
You must be hungry.

70
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:36,090
My house is nearby, so come with me.

71
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,310
Please wait here.

72
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,430
Yes.

73
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,840
We can take that horse and escape.

74
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,560
What the heck are you saying?

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,810
We must run further away.

76
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,190
They will track us down here
sooner or later.

77
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:59,710
Also, I can't eat alongside
those damn devils.

78
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,960
You are really...

79
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,010
Sorry for the wait. Come in.

80
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,600
Ah, thanks.

81
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,870
We will.

82
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,730
I will talk. Don't say anything stupid.

83
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,100
So you kids ran away from home?

84
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,750
What’s that?

85
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,320
It’s south Marleyan accent?

86
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,430
Nice to meet you.

87
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,840
We're siblings. I'm Ben and she's Mia.

88
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,130
We have our reasons
to run away from our parents.

89
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,920
If there's anything we can do
to help, we will gladly do it!

90
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,730
Please let us stay
here for a few days!

91
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,420
We beg you!

92
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,040
You kid shouldn't lower
your head like that.

93
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,710
Welcome to Blouse stables.

94
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,420
You can stay as long as you want.

95
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,540
Come mere and eat some breakfast.

96
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,980
You must be tired.

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,600
You may lay down after finishing that.

98
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,660
Lisa... this kid...

99
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,100
Sorry. You must've gone through a lot.

100
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,370
No...

101
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,950
I'm sorry for my sister's behaviour.

102
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,620
Thanks for the meal!

103
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,740
Delicious! This tastes great!

104
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,010
It's really good.

105
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,850
Go ahead and eat, Mia.

106
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,590
I would like to congratulate you on
the success of your campaign against Marley.

107
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:47,650
The leaders of Hizuru have nothing but praise
for the bravery shown by the nation of Eldia.

108
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,470
I'm honored by your words.

109
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,300
Welcome to the most dangerous
island in the world.

110
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,260
Yes.

111
00:06:54,770 --> 00:07:00,280
Our objective today is to witness
how dangerous it really is.

112
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,740
Is that the observation
unit I've heard so much about?

113
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,270
Yes.

114
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:11,910
It's the world's first flying boat, using
the iceburst stone as its fuel.

115
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:16,340
We shall take a good look at
the power of the Rumbling on it.

116
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,770
Rumour says Eren Yeager is in prison,

117
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,750
and all the volunteers have been arrested.

118
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,790
Is that true?

119
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,210
Please, Hange, explain to us.

120
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,090
Why did you force evacuation order to
all residents in Shiganshina district?

121
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,510
Wasn't it the Corps who made Reeves
company responsible for its reconstruction?

122
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,870
consult the Police Brigade.

123
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,180
Hange!

124
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,810
Yeager's victory has opened
a path to our future!

125
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,840
He proves us that the Eldians can survive now!

126
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:47,510
That means the relationship between him
and the Corps matters to all Eldians!

127
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,850
Hange.

128
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:53,010
You once said you would give
information to the taxpayers.

129
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,440
Have you changed your stance on that?

130
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,640
The situation has changed!

131
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:02,710
Information has a different meaning
now that we're connected to the world!

132
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,870
We understand that you're
in a difficult position, Hange.

133
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,560
So please look at us in the eye
and say it's okay for us to believe in you.

134
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,840
Everything we do is for
the sake of the Eldian people.

135
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,990
So it's you guys who leaked
the info about Eren?

136
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:38,100
Holger, Wim, Louise.

137
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,990
You recruits, and Floch.

138
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,990
Why did you do that?

139
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,280
Because Eren ought to be freed.

140
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,340
He hasn't done anything wrong.

141
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,710
He’s faced countless colossal
enemies and grasped victory.

142
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,230
That victory is the overwhelming power
named the Rumbling

143
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,050
which is also our ticket to survival.

144
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:06,440
Eren saved the lives of the
citizens of the New Eldian Empire.

145
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,770
No one can guarantee that the Rumbling

146
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,780
can save us as we expected it to.

147
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,970
To be frank, it's nothing more than
a story you heard from a stranger.

148
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,870
That's only because you're keeping
Eren locked in the prison.

149
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,960
Do we have the time to
waste on this?

150
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,160
At this rate, our great victory
will be all for naught.

151
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,590
The one that should lead this nation
is Eren Yeager.

152
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,020
You need to release him immediately.

153
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,090
Mmm..

154
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,090
You might be right.

155
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:47,190
Specifics aside, I was the one who made
the decision to see Zeke's plan through.

156
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,500
I should be held accountable.

157
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,430
Which is why I can't allow
any more insubordination.

158
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:58,200
You all will be prosecuted for the crime
of leaking information about Eren.

159
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,990
Bring these four to the detention room.

160
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,540
I will gladly go if it leads to
victory for humanity within the wall.

161
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,630
The stage always needs someone
to fill in this role.

162
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:25,410
Even if I leave, another
will come to take my place.

163
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,490
Do your best, Hange.

164
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,150
I'm tired.

165
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,530
No.

166
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,890
There's still more I need to look up.

167
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,740
Is this the cell you were locked in, Mikasa?

168
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,480
Eh? No.

169
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,120
I see.

170
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,850
What a shame.

171
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,960
Ah, but I don't regret violating
military regulation.

172
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:10,140
If Survey Corps' goal is to win, that means
rules are not always absolute, right?

173
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,190
Stop it, Louise.

174
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,810
You will only extend your sentence.

175
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,740
Ever since that day you saved me...

176
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,220
I haven't changed a bit.

177
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:25,240
When I saw you defeated a Titan
with human strength, I realized

178
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,820
that you can't save anyone without power.

179
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:34,110
I learnt that it's okay for us to
fight against unjust violence.

180
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:41,380
Ever since that day, I’ve been trying
my best to be just like you, so I...

181
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,350
Why did you join the Survey Corps, Mikasa?

182
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,480
If it's for Yeager,
then you should free…

183
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,280
I only have one thing to tell you.

184
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,470
You should shut your mouth.

185
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,600
It's all fine now.

186
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:24,880
Mikasa.

187
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,940
Ten months ago,

188
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,440
during the banquet celebrating the
opening of the trail system in Torst district,

189
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,890
the guard assigned to you
was suddenly changed...

190
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,750
...into Floch Forster.

191
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,410
He accompanied you to your lodgings
just as the festivities were winding down.

192
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,220
He's currently detained for
divulging secret information.

193
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:58,700
Also, your lodgings were located a few dozen
kilometres away from Eren Yeager's place.

194
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:05,620
Somehow right around that time, Eren began
to take more unauthorized actions.

195
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:11,460
Anyway, I'm pleased to have an excuse to
speak with such a beautiful woman today.

196
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,830
Gabi!

197
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,240
Gabi!

198
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,180
Gabi…!

199
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,950
How did it end up like this?

200
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,060
Could it be the work of the devils?!

201
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,960
Well, I'm sure it's because of the horse.

202
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,810
I bet none of the horses here
would let you ride them away from here.

203
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,570
We never learned how to
ride a horse anyway.

204
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,460
We can't get any information
in a countryside like this.

205
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,810
I believe it's better to avoid doing
anything reckless and just blend in.

206
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,680
What are you saying?

207
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,910
We should lay low and wait
for help here.

208
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,780
I'm sure the army from all over the world
will come to attack this island.

209
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,020
I'm sure my brother and Reiner
will come to save us.

210
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,390
Aren't you mad at Zeke?

211
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,830
We had a traitor right next to us!

212
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,400
There's nothing we can do.

213
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,070
Also, why Mia?

214
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,410
Why must I be your little sister?

215
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,090
Does it matter?

216
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,490
Guys.

217
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,840
Time for lunch.

218
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,940
You two sure are fast learners.

219
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,100
And strong, too.

220
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,070
Really? Thank you very much.

221
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,560
I see that people who work here are
young, including you, Kaya.

222
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:57,830
Yeah.

223
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,090
Because they are orphans.

224
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,850
Is that so?

225
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:06,130
The Queen's policies provide support
to children with no place to go.

226
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,600
This is where the kids who lost
their parents four years ago are gathered.

227
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,060
Looks like you haven't admitted your sin.

228
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,020
Eh?

229
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:20,440
Have you forgotten the horrible crime
people of this island committed against the world?

230
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,200
Only when every single
Eldian understands his sins

231
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,150
will the path to atonement open.

232
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,990
Does that have anything to do with
children losing their parents?

233
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,350
Of course.

234
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:37,080
No matter how good you may try to act,
your sin is too big for you to escape from.

235
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,040
Is that what they taught you in Marley?

236
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,420
How could you say that
to the person who helped you!

237
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,990
- This is about basic history.
- You're still saying that?

238
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,210
Wait, what did you just say?

239
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,820
You two are from Marley, right?

240
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,090
-Why?
-Why what?

241
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,110
Well, I mean, you said that yourself.

242
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,280
Eh?

243
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,150
Ah!

244
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,200
So you’ve known from the very beginning?

245
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,160
Eh?! Since we first met?!

246
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,270
That's really embarrassing!

247
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,930
Why didn't you tell us?

248
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,950
That's so mean, you know.

249
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:07,880
Eh?

250
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,810
What are you doing?!

251
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,330
The devil has showed her true form!

252
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,570
I knew something was off!

253
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,020
There's no way island devil
would be this nice!

254
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,560
C'mon, are you idiot?!

255
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,680
Hey!

256
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,790
What are you guys arguing about?

257
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:30,550
This is bad!

258
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:35,140
Mia is jealous that her big brother
is stolen away from her!

259
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,540
Looks like Kaya is getting
along with them.

260
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,630
They do seem to have cheered up a bit.

261
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,700
Sheesh.

262
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,630
It's dangerous, so don't play
around with that tool, okay?

263
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,790
Yes!

264
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,270
Why?

265
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,920
This is the village I used to live in.

266
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,490
A Titan came here four years ago.

267
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:04,359
Everyone in the village ran away
after seeing that Titan.

268
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:08,050
All while leaving my handicapped mom behind.

269
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,030
I couldn't do anything so I just sat there.

270
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,829
I was here... listening to the
sound of my mom getting eaten.

271
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,430
My mom was eaten alive.

272
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,460
Eventually, she couldn't even
say anything.

273
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:27,819
She kept screaming until
she lost her voice.

274
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:34,920
There are human outside the walls
and they call us a race of devils, right?

275
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,410
But I can’t understand why
the world despises us like that.

276
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,880
Mia, Ben, tell me.

277
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,140
What did my mom do?

278
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:48,180
What did she do that
makes them hate us so much?

279
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:53,170
That’s because of all the mass killing you
people did for thousands of years!

280
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,990
Thousands of years?

281
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,360
How could you forget that?!

282
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:03,620
The Eldians ruled and oppressed the world for
thousands of years using the power of Titans!

283
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,890
They stole the culture of other races,

284
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:10,960
forced them to have children they didn’t want,
and killed countless human beings!

285
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,000
Stop acting like the victim here!

286
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,150
But my mom was born and raised here.

287
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,540
I don't think my mom did
anything awful like that.

288
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:24,320
As I said, the problem is the sins your
ancestors committed a hundred years ago!

289
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,850
A hundred years ago?

290
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,570
Then what kind of sins have we committed?

291
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,710
Just recently you people trampled my city.

292
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,950
My mom was killed four years ago.

293
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,480
It has nothing to do with her!

294
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,940
Like I said, your ancestor has slaughtered
people around the world…

295
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,000
My mom didn't kill anyone!

296
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,040
Hey, Mia! Answer me properly!

297
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:51,070
Why must my mom suffer
such a painful death?

298
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,840
There should be a reason for it!

299
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,180
If there's none, why?!

300
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,250
Why must my mom
get eaten alive like that?!

301
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,000
Tell me! Why must she get killed?!

302
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,210
Tell me! Why?!

303
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,390
It's for reconnaissance.

304
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,410
The incursion on Paradis four years ago
was a reconnaissance mission

305
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:14,750
preparing for a large-scale attack.

306
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,020
Your mother got wrapped up in it.

307
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,340
Your mother didn't commit any sin.

308
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,550
I'm sorry.

309
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,130
You just leaked military
top-secret detail.

310
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,080
Why are you apologizing to her?

311
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,900
Thank you for telling me that, Ben.

312
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,030
But it's wrong for you to apologize.

313
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,440
You just happened to be born in Marley.

314
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:51,280
So how did you escape
from that situation?

315
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:57,880
A girl older than me came in
swinging an axe from our yard

316
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,740
and fought the Titan.

317
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,970
No way! That was too reckless!

318
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,200
Yeah.

319
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:08,810
In the end, she shielded me with her
own body to let me escape.

320
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,820
If she was still alive,

321
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,650
she'd never abandon two kids like you
who have nowhere to go.

322
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,940
Just like she didn’t abandon me.

323
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:24,610
We've been invited to a restaurant
where a Marleyan works.

324
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:30,500
If I bring you there, maybe you
can find a way to return home.

325
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,610
Why?

326
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:37,110
I want to become someone like her.

327
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:44,440
♫ Many birds with burnt wings ♫

328
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:51,120
♫ Scattering ashes and smiling ♫

329
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:57,620
♫ I wish someone ♫

330
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:03,760
♫ Spreading the proof of my existence ♫

331
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:17,980
♫ Even if my body turns into ashes
I will be immortal ♫

332
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:33,580
♫ Even if my body turns into ashes
I will be immortal ♫

333
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,950
After investigating the remains
of the Beast Titan,

334
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:47,520
we found parts of Zeke's body
that was exploded into pieces.

335
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,060
However, it's not enough.

336
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,070
All we found were his limbs.

337
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:58,830
He made it look like he died
to deceive us.

338
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:04,940
We believe Zeke has allied with enemy forces
on Paradis and escaped on their airship.

339
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:09,270
This modified anti-personnel
vertical maneuvering gear

340
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,570
uses Marleyan technology.

341
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:17,220
And the airship they stole for their
escape required military training to pilot,

342
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,440
especially at such a high
degree of proficiency.

343
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:25,300
He must've snuck them onto
the survey ship to Paradis four years ago.

344
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,080
His comrades in the Eldian
restorationists, that is.

345
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,450
Dammit!

346
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,690
We fought together all this time.

347
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,330
But he's actually a traitor?

348
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:37,580
Of course we have no intention
to let this end here.

349
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,520
Within the next six months,

350
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:43,470
the global military alliance will conduct
mopping-up operation against Paradis!

351
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,570
Six…Six months?!

352
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:48,850
Is that how long we have to wait
to rescue Gabi and Falco?

353
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,990
Those two are the best warrior
candidates we have now.

354
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,660
I believe losing them will
be a great loss to Marley.

355
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:02,580
It will also take a lot of time to train
the next batch of warrior candidates.

356
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:09,280
But the chance of winning is slim
if Marley attacks Paradis on its own.

357
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,030
We must wait for the allied forces to gather.

358
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,510
Zeke must be thinking the same thing.

359
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:19,540
That the Marleyan army won't attack
immediately after taking such a massive blow.

360
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:25,260
And he's not the kind of person who just
going to wait with no plan for six months.

361
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,690
We can't wait for the global allied
forces to be ready!

362
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:33,940
We must attack Paradis
island right away!

363
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,700
Just whom must we hate?

364
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,320
Just what is it that we must resent?

365
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,600
We should've already been
used to getting our belief shaken.

366
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,990
