00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,680
Hold on!

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,800
Dear customer, we're sorry,
but no touching is allowed here.

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,750
You…You got me wrong, Hitch!

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:23,140
Titans' memories are often triggered
by physical contact, so...

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,720
I thought I might be able to get
important information from this.

7
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,510
It's not like that I had any improper
thought or anything!

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,340
You're a guy, after all.

9
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,530
I understand why you would want
Annie's precious information.

10
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,220
I'm sorry, okay?

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,080
Just please don't throw me out…

12
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,600
I'm not gonna do that.

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,730
I'm sure Annie is bored just
having me as her chatting partner.

14
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:49,860
Eh?

15
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,950
I can't believe you.

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,350
All you do is sleeping, so why
are you so popular?

28
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,690
I don't mind you being interested in her.

29
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,060
But do you know what's
going on in the world?

30
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:40,630
Yeah.

31
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,470
Read this.

32
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:51,800
"The military continues to cling to
power and unjustly detains Eren Yeager."

33
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,520
The concern towards the military
is at its boiling point.

34
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,800
The military hasn't said anything
that pleased the crowds, after all.

35
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,400
Even so, they can't reveal the existence
of Zeke or the Rumbling.

36
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,320
Only Eren can save Eldia!

37
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,260
Only Yeager can avenge our citizen who were eaten!

38
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,040
The New Eldian Empire can
not exist without Eren Yeager!

39
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,240
What is this?

40
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,560
It's said the people have surrounded
the entire military base.

41
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,350
Hey, Hitch! Help us out!

42
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,070
Ugh, more work...

43
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,090
Armin!

44
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,210
Mikasa!

45
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,880
Thank goodness.

46
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,550
I'm glad you made it here safely.

47
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,670
We can't waste this chance we got.

48
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,850
Let's hurry.

49
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,770
The new recruits of Survey Corps?

50
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,460
What are they doing in the HQ?

51
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,720
I did go to meet Eren that day.

52
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,100
Oh?

53
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,340
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you earlier.

54
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,750
No wonder you'd detain the volunteers.

55
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,590
You sure act meek all of a sudden.

56
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,560
That was my thought before.

57
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,300
You people don't know what
the world is like.

58
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,910
It would be too late if you kept
postponing the discussion.

59
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,390
Eren had the same concern as I did.

60
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:33,400
So that's why you advised Eren to infiltrate
Marley to force the military into action?

61
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,450
I didn't say anything of the sort.

62
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,940
But I did say the military
government needed some push.

63
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,770
Is that all?

64
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,659
You put yourself in danger
just to meet him in secret.

65
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,920
Surely you had a specific agreement in mind.

66
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,370
Of course.

67
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:55,570
We weren't in a position to formally
request a meeting with him, after all.

68
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,810
Yet you still decided to
meet him in secret,

69
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,390
thus successfully manipulated Eren
and accomplished Zeke's goal, right?

70
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,770
There was no point of doing that!

71
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,330
I just wanted Eren Yeager to
get to know me and…

72
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,160
Anyway,

73
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,400
to us, Eren's Founder was the key
to crush Marley once and for all.

74
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,290
He delivered a massive blow to Marley
just as we had hoped.

75
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,240
No.

76
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,010
It was beyond what we imagined.

77
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:44,840
He punished Marley that made us
suffer for years all by himself.

78
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,270
He's a such a powerful person
who even possesses the Founding.

79
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,220
Commander Pixis.

80
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,050
Do you know what's unfolding
before us right now?

81
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:00,490
We're witnessing the moment
when the history changes.

82
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,580
This world will be reborn
thanks to the brothers.

83
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,540
I just want to witness it
right next to them.

84
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,130
In other words, what drove you to
meet Eren in secret was your curiosity?

85
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,380
You can say that again.

86
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,470
The other Volunteers don't know
that I met him in secret.

87
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,970
This is all because of my reckless action.

88
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,570
It's true that I deceived you,

89
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,680
but everything I did was for Eldia.

90
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,680
I hope so, too.

91
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,760
Tell us what you talked about. All of it.

92
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,830
Do you know the best way of telling lies?

93
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,450
The best way is to mix truths in it.

94
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,690
I can't believe this.

95
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,480
I'm honestly disappointed that
you guys still doubt us after all this time.

96
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,980
We're comrades, aren't we?

97
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:06,260
We broke a sweat together
in these past three years.

98
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,430
We built rails, trades system,
and everything to flourish this island!

99
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,370
We were completely devoted to Eldia.

100
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,920
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:20,490
I didn't expect this would happen only ten months
after the opening ceremony of the railroad.

102
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,460
Yes, indeed.

103
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,720
We swore to fight for
Eldia's future, and yet...

104
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,750
What…What is it?

105
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,640
Eh?

106
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,650
Yelena admitted that she met
Eren in secret?

107
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,270
Is that true?

108
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,440
So you really don't know?

109
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,560
Of course I don't.

110
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,030
Really.

111
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,159
It does look like it.

112
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,659
At least to me.

113
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,520
Yelena...

114
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,630
"There is no way Yelena would do that."

115
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:56,350
It's what people usually say here.

116
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,620
Should I assume you've expected her 
to do something like that since you didn't say it?

117
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,390
Well, that's...

118
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,660
It came in the wrong order,

119
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,870
but now we've got enough convincing
reasons to detain the volunteers.

120
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,090
Tell us everything you know about Yelena.

121
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,830
For the sake of our future cooperation.

122
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,010
As you already know, it was
Yelena who organized the volunteers.

123
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,540
It was hard for us to work together at
first as we were suspicious of each other.

124
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,320
But each time, she would
get her own hands dirty

125
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,140
to show her loyalty towards
Zeke and the organization.

126
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,110
She'd even kill the friends who
lived with us for a long time.

127
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,549
All the Marleyan who doubted us
were gotten rid of as accidental deaths.

128
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,900
We overcame that by believing it was
all for the sake of our stolen homeland.

129
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,870
That's odd.

130
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,740
Eh?

131
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,680
In here, she argued with the military
government for Marleyan's human rights,

132
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,720
even though she used to
be merciless on them.

133
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,390
Yet on this island…

134
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
Now,

135
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,480
come with me, Onyankopon.

136
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,490
Eh?

137
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,350
Hange is still on the move, isn't she?

138
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,530
Yes.

139
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,090
She said there's something
she needs to confirm.

140
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,620
Yeah.

141
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,400
I did allow her to take
one of the volunteers along, but...

142
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,430
I can't let you two meet Eren.

143
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,060
Why is that?

144
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,980
Because we're now certain that
the volunteers are in contact with him.

145
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,760
Eren concealed his secret meetings
with the volunteers,

146
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,700
leading up to the assault on Marley.

147
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,650
We're currently looking for the mastermind
behind these meetings along with his followers.

148
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:54,580
Eren has maintained his silence ever
since these facts were brought to light.

149
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,720
We still know nothing about what
he did during his time alone in Marley.

150
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,530
We believe that Eren is being
controlled by Zeke.

151
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,830
I only share these because
you're his close friends.

152
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,950
So please keep it a secret.

153
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,210
Eren is being controlled?
No way...

154
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,150
What will happen to Eren?

155
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,810
What's that?

156
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,690
Hmm?

157
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,050
It's nothing.

158
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,730
I had nowhere else to put this,
so I had the recruits bring it here.

159
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,850
But Sir!

160
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:42,350
If he's staying silent, then maybe
we can do something about it!

161
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,380
I can't guarantee you that we can
get Eren to speak the truth,

162
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,620
but it should be worth a try.

163
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,910
This situation requires great caution.

164
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,140
That is all.

165
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,500
Why?

166
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,440
As you said,
it should be worth a try.

167
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,140
So why did he refuse?

168
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,800
If I had to think of a reason...

169
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,540
The military government might've
already given up on Eren.

170
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,720
Excuse us.

171
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:28,990
If that's the case, they would already
start looking for the Founder's hire.

172
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,710
I'm going to eavesdrop.

173
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,190
Wait, Mikasa!

174
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,660
It's okay. I won't let them see me.

175
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,190
We can't afford violating
any rules now.

176
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:42,650
Given the situation, we need to know
the military's next move as soon as possible.

177
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,070
Whatever happens, I won't let Eren…

178
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,110
Armin! Are you hurt?

179
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,040
I'm fine.

180
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,630
Put out the fire!

181
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,390
- What happened?! Anyone injured?
- Hurry!

182
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,490
Over here! Get help!

183
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,300
Hurry!

184
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,110
Are you two okay?

185
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,580
Hitch, what happened?

186
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,530
The Supreme Commander's room
just suddenly...

187
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,840
Where's the Supreme Commander?

188
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,730
Dedicate your heart!

189
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,410
Our anger has reached them!
Now is the time to fight!

190
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,730
I will fight, too!

191
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,110
- Me, too!
- So will I!

192
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:39,880
That's right!

193
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,740
Let us bring victory to
the New Eldian Empire!

194
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,810
Dedicate your heart!

195
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,800
Dedicate your heart!

196
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,130
Dedicate your heart!

197
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,350
Dedicate your heart!

198
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,630
Dedicate your heart!

199
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,140
Dedicate your heart!

200
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,650
Supreme Commander Zackly's
personal custom chair.

201
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,980
It is believed that a bomb
has been planted in it.

202
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,560
Four soldiers, including Commander
himself, were lost in the explosion.

203
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,000
The culprits and their motivation are unknown.

204
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,060
He was with me all day.

205
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,520
And the volunteers are
under house arrest.

206
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,570
Then are there any other
factions you can think of?

207
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,100
That chair...

208
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,990
Commander said that he had
the recruits bring it for him.

209
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,460
From which branch?

210
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,130
He only said recruits.

211
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:38,920
But before Mikasa and I visited his room,
we saw recruits running away from the HQ.

212
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,600
They're from the Survey Corps.

213
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,810
Speaking of the Survey Corps...

214
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,290
I heard some of its members were punished
for leaking information about Eren.

215
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,010
Could it be...

216
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,030
Emergency!

217
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,010
Eren Yeager has escaped from
the underground cell!

218
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,430
Assemble all soldiers
and search for him!

219
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,080
Roger!

220
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,260
Hurry! We will go, too!

221
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,810
Armin...

222
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,240
Just... what is happening?

223
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,940
What a big group.

224
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,210
How many are here?

225
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,670
We have more comrades
beyond the ones present here.

226
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,600
Including those who blew
Darius Zackly away with bomb.

227
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:45,090
You're the only one who can
save the Eldian Empire.

228
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,170
Eren Yeager.

229
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,020
It will be okay, Mikasa.

230
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,920
Eren will understand.

231
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,100
I'm sure he will,
once we talk with him.

232
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,480
Locate Zeke's position.

233
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,640
Over a hundred soldiers,
including Flock Foster,

234
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,220
have disappeared from their
cells along with their guards.

235
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,300
It is believed that all of them have abandoned
the military after Eren's escape.

236
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,420
It should be safe to say that they're also
the ones who killed the Supreme Commander.

237
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,060
We need a name for them.

238
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:31,450
We will now call them the anti-military
organization, the Yeagerists.

239
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,700
As for their objective...

240
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,310
Do you know, Hange?

241
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:40,370
Their one and only goal should be
to put Zeke and Eren in contact.

242
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:44,290
Then, to reform the military
under the leadership of Eren.

243
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,560
They're showing their resolve through
assassinating the Supreme Commander.

244
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:55,520
The final trigger was the Military's plan
of transferring the Founding Titan

245
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:58,340
without notifying us
in the Survey Corps.

246
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,740
We knew exactly what would've
happen if we had told you.

247
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:06,760
Not to mention, most of the Yeagerist
are from the Survey Corps.

248
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,150
How are you going to take responsibility
for that, Commander Hange?

249
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,490
I will accept any punishment necessary.

250
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,110
But resigning from my position right now
would be the most irresponsible thing to do.

251
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,740
And we still don't know how many
hidden Yeagerist are out here

252
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,760
or which branch they belong to.

253
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,030
That's right.

254
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,520
They might even be standing
right in front of me right now.

255
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,990
Any of you could explore here
and I wouldn't be surprised.

256
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,210
Roeg, don't be ridiculous.

257
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,210
How are you going to prove it?

258
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,040
Unless you can, we can't let
the Survey Corps roam free!

259
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,260
Enough!

260
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,630
We still have a guest here.

261
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,880
Don't we have other things to do
besides bickering amongst ourselves?

262
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,250
Hange.

263
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,600
How many soldiers know
where Zeke is being confined?

264
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:53,190
Levi and the 30 other soldiers
who were watching over Zeke.

265
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:56,060
Plus another three who were responsible
for resupply and communication.

266
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,060
And me.

267
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,860
Bring those three here.

268
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,920
Nile, is the Queen's residence secure?

269
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,940
Only a select few know where it is,
but I'll go back and check.

270
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,050
Eren's first objective would be
to make contact with Zeke.

271
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,180
Next, Queen Historia.

272
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,589
We need to make sure these two
are under absolute protection.

273
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,740
Yes, sir!

274
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,880
Commander Pixis!

275
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:20,130
Now that we've lost the Supreme Commander,

276
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,960
the only one who can
lead all of us is you.

277
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,810
Do you have any plans going forward?

278
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,120
We've lost.

279
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,280
Let's surrender to Eren.

280
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,020
There's nothing we can do
with enemies inside the military.

281
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,570
Even if we did manage to smoke out
every last one of them,

282
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,950
a lot of blood would be
spilled in the process.

283
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,820
We have no time to waste on such folly.

284
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,780
Our actions have made many soldiers
desert the military.

285
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,620
That is why we lost.

286
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,730
No way!

287
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,210
Are you going to give in to those
who killed the Supreme Commander?

288
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:04,080
I knew Zackly for a long time.

289
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:08,590
I'm sure he'd be satisfied to
live and die for the revolution.

290
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,480
Most of all,

291
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:16,660
the four who died wouldn't want their
funerals to come at the cost of Eldia's fall.

292
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,540
So you're planning to submit
to the Yeager brothers?

293
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,360
It's not submission.

294
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:27,580
We will negotiate with the Yeagerist
using Zeke's location as a bargaining chip.

295
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:34,380
We'll do the Rumbling experiment as planned
and stake Eldia's survival on it.

296
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,920
However, we will not talk about
the assassination of our top dog.

297
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:46,430
If that's what's needed to prevent the deaths
of hundreds, if not thousands of our comrades,

298
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,110
then it's worth it.

299
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:56,180
Now all of you, get on it!

300
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,440
Yes, sir!

301
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,990
Commander.

302
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,420
I apologize for that unseemly display.

303
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,480
No, it's a path any country would go through.

304
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,080
We can no longer ensure your safety.

305
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,180
Please stay close to the port until
the situation is under control.

306
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,570
Yes.

307
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,800
We sincerely hope for Eldia's victory.

308
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,850
Miss Mikasa.

309
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:27,470
If anything happens, please
escape to our ship at once.

310
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,790
Thank you for your consideration, Lady Kiyomi.

311
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,200
But I am an Eldian.

312
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:38,060
I want to watch over the future of
this island where I was born and raised.

313
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,940
Please, no need to mind me.

314
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,650
What are you saying?

315
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,460
We came here for your sake…

316
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,360
Even without the underground resource?

317
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,790
You don't care who leads this nation...

318
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,030
...as long as the Rumbling succeeds, right?

319
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,230
...Yes.

320
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,080
If the Rumbling's power is not
what it promised to be,

321
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,660
Hizuru will surely cut off
their ties with us.

322
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,270
What we've invested will be
for nothing and Azumabito will meet its end.

323
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,340
In that case, 
I have more reason to not rely on you.

324
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,670
We Azumabito have always adapted
to tumultuous times.

325
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:23,780
But now we've been derided as
wretched, penny-pinching vixens.

326
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,600
Still...

327
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:31,630
We can't afford to lose our pride as a clan
that your mother handed down to you.

328
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,450
Whatever happens to this nation,
I will do anything to protect you.

329
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,100
Can't believe we're supposed to work with
Eren who killed the Supreme Commander.

330
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,570
We still don't know for sure
if Eren is the one who did it.

331
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,510
Keep your voice down, Mikasa.

332
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:49,670
You know people already suspect
us being Yeagerist, right?

333
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,910
Seriously speaking, whose
side are you on, Mikasa?

334
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,830
I told you Armin and I nearly
got caught up in that explosion.

335
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,560
Is that not enough clue for you?

336
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,150
Huh?

337
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,430
Stop fighting.

338
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,660
Like Commander Pixis said,

339
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,250
infighting will only lead to our downfall.

340
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:10,280
Then are you saying it's okay to
entrust everything to Eren and Zeke?

341
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,240
No.

342
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,860
That's not good.

343
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,650
Judging from the situation,

344
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:19,370
Zeke and Yelena's insurance plan
is taking effects.

345
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,410
We should expect they have more
under their sleeves.

346
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:29,370
We need to figure out Zeke's intentions
before they make even bigger fools out of us.

347
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,520
Of course, it would be nice if this
is all just my wild speculation.

348
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,650
Do you have any leads?

349
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,290
The Marleyan POWs workplaces
that she oversaw seems suspicious.

350
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:43,280
Like the restaurant, for example.

351
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,310
What a nice place!

352
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,250
It's the first time 
I've been in a place like this.

353
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,490
Me, too.

354
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,620
Isn't this great, kids?

355
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,930
Make sure to eat a lot today.

356
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,030
Yes!

357
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,680
Those darn soldiers sure are noisy today.

358
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,970
♫ In an instant ♫

359
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:24,970
♫ In an abandoned world ♫

360
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:36,150
♫ If you can't fly, please tell him ♫

361
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:45,580
♫ Many birds with burnt wings ♫

362
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:52,250
♫ Scattering ashes and smiling ♫

363
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:58,760
♫ I wish someone ♫

364
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:04,890
♫ Spreading the proof of my existence ♫

365
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:19,110
♫ Even if my body turns into ashes
I will be immortal ♫

366
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:34,710
♫ Even if my body turns into ashes
I will be immortal ♫

367
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,580
Gabi and Falco seek help from
the captured Marleyan soldier.

368
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:49,680
Will they find a bright future
from what they believe in?

369
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,050
Or perhaps...

370
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,840
