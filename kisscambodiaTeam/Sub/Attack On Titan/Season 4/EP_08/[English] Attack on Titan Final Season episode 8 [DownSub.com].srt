00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,980
Reiner!


3
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,080
Eren!


4
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,850
We have to stop now.


5
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,050
I don't have any strength left.


6
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,900
I don’t think Reiner…will come to kill us.


7
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,430
Let's go back.


8
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,970
Back to our home.


9
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,280
Reiner...


10
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,340
See you around.


11
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,900
Protect the airship from the enemy below!


12
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,580
All the ammunitions should be used against the enemy!


13
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,100
Finally...


14
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,330
They're retreating.


15
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,210
...’Are we safe now?


16
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,670
They escaped?


17
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:42,490
Gabi!


18
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:46,860
Eren Yeager!


19
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,430
Gabi!


20
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:49,950
I won't let you get away!


21
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:52,000
I will definitely kill you!

33
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,770
I can't believe how messy you are.


34
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,230
You look like you just fell
in a pile of shit.


35
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,399
Eren.


36
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:20,860
Captain...


37
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,980
It's been a while, Eren.


38
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,280
You're as easy to kick as always.


39
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,659
I’ll put you under arrest.


40
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,590
Then we can talk.


41
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,360
I don't mind.


42
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,380
But everything is like
what I wrote in my letter.


43
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,409
You should’ve agreed by now.


44
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,870
You’ve got the same look


45
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,280
as those jerks whom
I'm sick of seeing in the underground city.


46
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,900
I didn’t expect you’d end up like this.


47
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,660
You, too.


48
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,450
Are you happy?


49
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,010
Everything went according to your plan.


50
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,250
Don't let them escape!


51
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,220
Shoot them down as many as you can!


52
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,290
Get in! Hurry!


53
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,460
Let them know that none of their
weapons can shoot down this airship!


54
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,570
Jean!


55
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,690
You should get in now!


56
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,130
I'll cover for you!


57
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,110
I'm counting on you,
Commander Lobov!


58
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,780
I told you, I'm just a new recruit!


59
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,830
We no longer need Garrison!


60
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,700
Neither do we need those old money-suckers!


61
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,890
Jean!


62
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,909
Hold on!


63
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,840
Called the roll yet?


64
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,800
We're still waiting for
Squad Lima in the front.


65
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,850
We've currently confirmed six deaths.


66
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,260
I see...


67
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,550
Shit!


68
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,300
Just compare it to the losses
we caused to the enemy.


69
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,160
It's a huge victory!


70
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:23,220
The new Eldian empire's first battle
has ended with a huge victory!


71
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,830
Let’s cheer for it!


72
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:32,520
That's how we pay tribute to
our six fallen heroes!


73
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,770
First battle, huh...


74
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,760
Just how long will it last?


75
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,040
Just... how many more do we need to kill?


76
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:51,090
For now, once again, we survived this one,


77
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,800
though it’s not fair to our lost friends...


78
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,500
But you guys are special to me.


79
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,580
That's how I feel.


80
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,050
That hurts, idiot.


81
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,770
Don't hug people with that
lump of iron on.


82
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,530
What's that, Jean?


83
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,090
The real idiot is the guy who tries
to groom a fresh beard.


84
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,880
I’m referring to you! Idiot!


85
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,790
Huh?


86
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,180
He's right, you know?


87
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,900
It's not like you can eat
a beard or anything.


88
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,820
Huh?!


89
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,270
Anyway, when will we eat?


90
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,490
Wait until we get to the island, okay?


91
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,010
What a useless commander officer!


92
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,240
Gabi!


93
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,140
Gabi! Wait!


94
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,710
Let’s stop.


95
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,970
The enemies can fly;
it's pointless to run after them.


96
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,030
You understand, right?


97
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,020
But Zofia...


98
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,710
Her torso got crushed by falling rubble.


99
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,720
I was sitting right next to her.


100
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,890
Udo tried to save Zofia.


101
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,890
But he got stomped by the panicking crowd.


102
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,450
He got stomped over and over
until his head got crushed completely.


103
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:26,310
The two gate guards scolded me.


104
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,730
It's all because I tried to go back
to the plaza.


105
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:35,630
They were so desperate to warn me,
an Eldian, about how dangerous it is.


106
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,950
And then...


107
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,770
They got shot by the woman
on the rooftop and died.


108
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:47,300
I'm an Eldian born in this internment zone.


109
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,090
People would spit at me when
they see me walking around town.


110
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,010
I had a lot of awful
experience here, but...


111
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,270
That's exactly why I must work hard.


112
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,220
I wanted to prove to the world
that Eldians were good people.


113
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:06,450
I believed that the time would come
when I could be proud of this Eldian armband.


114
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,770
That's why I was able to work
so hard until now.


115
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,490
But it's all destroyed now.


116
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,490
This internment zone...


117
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,550
This place is my home, and
it's the home of people I love.


118
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:22,450
How am I supposed to forgive
those who trample over it?


119
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:29,520
Will you still ask me to stop
running after them despite that?


120
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,550
Mr. Zeke was killed in front of us.


121
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,580
We couldn't do anything.


122
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,520
We don't even know
why we had to go through that…


123
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,770
Why, Reiner?


124
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,370
Why did my mom have to be
eaten by a Titan that day?


125
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,340
It's because they were trampled.


126
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:56,800
Our enemies got attacked by Marley
Warriors and many died.


127
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,950
And this must be their revenge.


128
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,090
Did you see that?


129
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,700
No... I didn’t.


130
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,430
Neither did I.


131
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,730
Our enemy were originally the island
devils threatening world peace, right?


132
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,020
Didn't you study?


133
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,610
They're savage devils who deserve
to die, as they always have had.


134
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,610
They're different from us.


135
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,550
I'm just like you, Reiner.


136
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,330
Be it on the other side of the sea
or inside the wall,


137
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,340
we're the same.


138
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,150
Squad Lima?


139
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,180
Alright, all on board now.


140
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,590
Tell the control room that
it's time to rise and withdraw!


141
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,900
Yes, sir!


142
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,020
A child?!


143
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,200
I hit him...


144
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,990
It's still... connected.


145
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,620
Gabi!


146
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,820
What are you planning to do?!


147
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,780
It's this trigger...


148
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,150
If I pull this hard...


149
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,750
Gabi... are you going...


150
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,600
...to get on that ship?


151
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,870
I'm going to kill all of those island devils.


152
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,770
You will just get yourself killed, idiot!


153
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:09,020
Tell my parents,
Reiner and everyone else,


154
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,150
that I fought until the end.


155
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,150
Even if we can't win now...


156
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,080
those who are still alive will surely
carry on my will.


157
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,660
Falco!


158
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:21,880
Gabi!


159
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,450
What are you two doing?!


160
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,610
Brother...


161
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,620
See you, Falco.


162
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,490
You are... a good guy.


163
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,070
You must save Gabi


164
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,080
from our bleak future.


165
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,470
Falco!


166
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,480
Falco?!


167
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,580
Why?!


168
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,800
The one who inherits the Armored Titan...


169
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,830
is me!


170
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,040
I just heard something.


171
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,210
Hey, quiet down!


172
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,740
Raise your voice!


173
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,330
It's our huge victory!


174
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,950
Hey!


175
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,870
By the way, have
you seen Lobov yet?


176
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,950
No, but he should’ve been here by now.


177
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,940
Sasha!


178
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,120
You bitch!


179
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,070
Sasha! Hey!


180
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,170
Stay with us!


181
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,440
Hey!


182
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,340
You're so loud...


183
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:27,110
Is the food... ready yet?


184
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,200
Get a tourniquet! We must
cover her wound! Hurry!


185
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,400
Okay!


186
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,560
Sasha! Hang in there! We’ll reach the island soon!


187
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,520
Meat...


188
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,620
Jean.


189
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:56,440
These two got up here using Lobov's
vertical maneuver gear.


190
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,110
I'm going to throw them out.


191
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,790
No objections, right?


192
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,410
Can throwing some kids out of an airship...


193
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,850
... stop all this bloodshed?


194
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,360
What happened to Braun and Grice?


195
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,370
Well...


196
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,770
They ran off on their own and
haven't returned since then.


197
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,580
Pieck...


198
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,570
Commander...


199
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,090
Now I remember.


200
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:53,980
That Marleyan soldier who led the Warrior
unit and trapped me and Galliard in that hole.


201
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,980
I saw her
three years ago.


202
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,720
After Reiner and the Warrior unit
retreat from the island...


203
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:09,360
She was a member of the first survey
fleet that was sent to Paradis island.


204
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,270
From the missing survey ship?


205
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,570
Yes.


206
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,490
And moreover...


207
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,610
That beard didn’t fit her.


208
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,340
Hey, how long are you going to wear it?


209
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,550
Really?


210
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,660
People seem to like it, though.


211
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,750
They're still yelling there?


212
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,520
Don't touch me, you devils!


213
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,140
We haven't lost yet!


214
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:45,620
Our folks will carry on
War Chief Zeke's will!


215
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,840
Gabi, stop it!


216
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,040
What are you planning to do with her, Jean?


217
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:57,170
We, the true Eldian, will wish you a horrible death.


218
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,600
Tell that to your ring-leader
once you kill me!


219
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,190
I will bring you to him.


220
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,050
Just try to say the same thing to him.


221
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:20,450
How did you figure out it was her?


222
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,109
That's because...


223
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,550
I was quite interested in her.


224
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,230
Because she...


225
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,480
...was one of Zeke's followers.


226
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,670
Gabi...? Falco?


227
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,910
Why are you here?


228
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,470
...What do you mean, why?


229
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,360
...Why are you here, Mr. Zeke?


230
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,870
So you are alive!


231
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,550
But, to think that you got
captured by these devils...


232
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,020
Who are these brats?


233
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:56,550
They killed Lobov and got here
using his equipment.


234
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,610
And then this girl shot Sasha.


235
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,650
It doesn't seem like she can make it...


236
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,480
I'm leaving the rest to you, Onyankopon.


237
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,600
Roger that, Ms. Hange!


238
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:21,840
So, did everything really go
according to your plan?


239
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,160
Zeke Yeager.


240
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,460
It was good for the most part.


241
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,370
But we made some mistakes.


242
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,380
Mr. Zeke...?


243
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,680
Who are these kids?


244
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,100
Mistakes.


245
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,690
Yelena!


246
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,190
Weren't you supposed to restrain
the Jaw and the Cart?!


247
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,520
Some of our friends died
because of you!


248
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,120
I'm sorry.


249
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,000
I've certainly trapped those two
down the hole, but...


250
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,660
That was my fault.


251
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:02,010
And the Beast threw more pellets
at us also because of them, huh?


252
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,250
That was quite of an improv act
for a clown.


253
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,120
Don't you agree, Beardy?


254
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,960
Don't glare at me like that, Levi.


255
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,650
What would you do if I wet my pants?


256
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,780
You're quite an actor yourself.


257
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,620
Considering you must've wanted
to kill me right there when you could.


258
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,810
I'm the type who likes to save
the best for last.


259
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,370
I want to savor the taste well, after all.


260
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:37,910
We killed the Marleyan army officers and
destroyed its primary naval fleets and ports.


261
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,330
We should be able to buy time for now.


262
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:46,040
You mean the time until the rest
of the world attack Paradis island?


263
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:51,400
We risked our lives to get you back every
time you get captured by the enemy.


264
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,250
No matter how many of us
died because of it.


265
00:19:55,050 --> 00:20:00,350
But despite that, you went ahead to
go with a plan to make yourself a hostage.


266
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,570
As you wish, we have no
choice but to follow along.


267
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:11,120
You trust us, but unfortunately,
We’ve lost our trust in you.


268
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,370
But now that we have both
the Founding Titan and a Titan of royal blood,


269
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:23,880
all of those precious sacrifices will surely
bear fruit and bring freedom to Eldia.


270
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,190
Sasha...


271
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,860
She's dead.


272
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:00,940
Connie.


273
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,230
Sasha...


274
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,960
...what were...


275
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,990
...her final words?


276
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,060
She said... meat.


277
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:27,330
I brought meat from
the officers' storehouse.


278
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,240
It's fine!


279
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:36,740
Once we retake the land, we can
raise cows and sheep again.


280
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,280
Eren...


281
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:56,230
Sasha died because you got
the Survey Corps involved, you know?


282
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,970
♫ In an instant ♫


283
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:24,970
♫ In an abandoned world ♫


284
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:36,150
♫ If you can fly, please tell him ♫


285
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:45,580
♫ Many birds with burnt wings ♫


286
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:52,250
♫ Scattering ashes and smiling ♫


287
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:58,760
♫ I wish someone ♫


288
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:04,890
♫ Spreading the proof of my existence ♫


289
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:19,110
♫ Even if my body turns into ashes
I will be immortal ♫


290
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:34,710
♫ Even if my body turns into ashes
I will be immortal ♫


291
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:44,510
Maybe there was another way.


292
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,550
However, we can't change the past.


293
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,580
We have no choice but to continue
to move forward on this path.


294
