[Episode 4]

21
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,270
After all, seeing you like in Angry Birds (a video game), you look very cute.

22
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,640
Blockhead!

23
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,680
Like this, you'll always be by my side.

24
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,460
What's up, what's up, what's up?

25
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,910
The electricity was out a moment ago.

26
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,190
You scared me!

27
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,420
I had thought some big thing happened. This isn't the first time.

28
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,680
The picture I just painted has gone! I haven't saved it.

29
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,410
Here! Wait a moment.

30
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,850
I finally got a chance to give this to you.

31
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,920
- This is... 
 - Open it!

32
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,540
Xin'er!

33
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,670
Mom.

34
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,070
Xin'er, you are back.

35
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,280
Who is this?

36
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,490
Auntie, I'm Ling Sheng. Don't you remember me?

37
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,940
Ling Sheng?

38
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,440
You've grown! It's so hard to recognize.

39
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,000
Auntie, wait a minute!

40
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,800
Auntie, I have a little gift for you.

41
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,160
You shouldn't be!

42
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,040
Please accept it.

43
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,150
Then I won't be too polite.

44
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,740
Thank you.

45
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,720
Please come in.

46
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,970
Auntie, today I came in a hurry.

47
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,420
So I won't come in but maybe another day.

48
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,420
Alright, alright. Please come when you have time.

49
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,440
Okay.

50
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,360
Xin'er, I'm leaving now.

51
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,060
Have a safe trip!

52
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,400
- Auntie, see you again! 
 - See you.

53
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,820
Bye-bye.

54
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,410
This Ling Sheng, is he the one who kept on talking about marrying you all the time when you were both little?

55
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,720
Mom, that was just a joke when we were young.

56
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,910
As I see, he still has you in mind.

57
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,580
Mom, please don't mistakenly pair us up.

58
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,660
Little girl, think no more about

59
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,000
someone whom you aren't sure of his survival.

60
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,180
Don't you want to achieve something in your life?

61
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,530
It isn't enough to rely only on yourself.

62
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,320
A man create his own world.

63
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,970
But for a woman, one should take control of a man's heart.

64
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,670
That Ling Sheng has all his mind on you.

65
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,960
It's the best choice now.

66
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,640
Understand?

67
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,530
There are so many of these cards, when can we collect all of them?

68
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,970
I'm sick of collecting these. Can we change to something else?

69
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:55,200
No way! Brother Yue likes these Water Margin cards.

70
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,080
Let's get in.

00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:03,800
[Express Delivery Service]

72
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,750
[Express Delivery Service] 
 (TN: lit. Arriving fast delivery - the same as the previous segment.)

73
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,200
- Anxin, we're leaving. 
 - Okay. 
 - Bye-bye.

74
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,340
- What are we going to have? 
 - Can't think of anything.

75
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,470
Manager, which way will you go? Can you give me a lift?

76
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,290
Okay. No problem.

77
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,800
Anxin, let's go together.

78
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,300
No need. My house is very close by.

79
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,420
You guys, go ahead!

80
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,810
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

81
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,700
Anxin.

82
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,510
Why are you here?

83
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,560
I came out for a troll.

84
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,440
Your leg isn't good and you still want to take a troll?

85
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,990
Let's go home.

86
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,310
Accompany me to the property management office to pick up some packages then.

87
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,960
Okay. You'll lead me.

88
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,350
Let me push you. It'd be faster.

89
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,870
Sure.

90
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,230
I'm tired. It'd be better if I just get them myself.

91
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,290
Every time you get a package, do you always have to go that far?

92
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,310
That's right.

93
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,240
I got off work too late today so I have to leave all these packages at the management office.

94
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,900
However, I can only keep them there for a bit but not too long.

95
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,350
You think, it would be great if picking these packages is like going to a bank.

96
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,850
You can do it any time.

97
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,840
Aren't you buying too many?

98
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,790
Big discount! Spending 300¥ and get 300¥ back.

99
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,800
It's almost free.

100
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,590
It's a business strategy.

101
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:30,090
You aren't a shop-owner, what do you know about business strategy?

102
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,920
Moving all these stuff is tiring

103
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,840
but opening them is so joyous.

104
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,610
For you.

105
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,220
Don't you complain that this phone is too old!

106
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,970
But... but it has everything that a phone should have.

107
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,280
I'm asking you to enter the phone number.

108
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,850
Okay. You see? This tree is me.

109
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,410
This tree is ugly.

110
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,410
Don't say that! This is a fortune tree.

111
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,490
I'm hungry. Prepare something for me.

112
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,670
Exactly! I happen to be hungry, too.

113
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,410
- Spicy or sea— 
 - Just instant noodle?

114
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,120
Let me cook it.

115
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,340
There is no money for me to buy a pot.

116
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,060
Don't you worry! I learn a dish from a TV show.

117
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,040
Art and real-life aren't the same.

118
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,600
Turn around.

119
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,900
Th-that's enough. If you add more I'll be fat. It's alright.

120
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,300
Shouldn't girls be chubby?

121
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Chubby? Do you think we are pigs?

122
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Take your chopsticks.

123
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,100
It's all yours.

124
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,300
It's enough.

125
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,000
Can you cook more tasty food from now on?

126
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Then we can eat this more often so we don't have to eat instant ramen.

127
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,400
- In the past, did you eat instant ramen every day?
 -Yes

128
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,400
It's cheap, so I ate ramen.

129
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,800
Then in the future I'll make ramen for you every day.

130
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,300
Okay.

131
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Don't waste food.

132
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,300
Hello?

133
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,200
Lend me $300,000

134
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,700
Why do you want money again? Is money the only thing between us?

135
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,800
Ai Li will personally pay you back.

136
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,300
Then I'll send it over right away.

137
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,400
Kisses and hugs.

138
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,640
Doctor Xiao, you treat your girlfriend so well.

139
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,300
Your room, too.

140
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Did you win something?

141
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,200
I just randomly chose some scratch cards.

142
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,700
Randomly?

143
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,400
And you won the lottery? You won big?

144
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,600
I'm lucky. I can't help it.

145
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,000
How is this lucky?

146
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,300
This is as if you saved the Milky Way in your past life.

147
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,580
There's still $200,000 in here. You take it.

148
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,200
I can't take this money. I didn't win it.

149
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,000
Anyways, I won't receive payment for doing nothing.

150
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,600
I don't want it.

151
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,220
Take it. The password is 888888.

152
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,800
I've received it.

153
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,200
I'll help you save it.

154
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,400
Xiao Ba, when I took you in -

155
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,800
Let me tell you, in the future I'll do anything you say.

156
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,800
You'll agree to anything?

157
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,040
Only serious things.

158
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,400
I'm not just giving you this money for nothing.

159
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,700
It's so that you can serve me better.

160
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,500
I understand. Don't worry.

161
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,000
Anxin, I'll help you.

162
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
Look.

163
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,400
Manager Du sure takes extra care of Anxin.

164
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,200
Don't you know? Gu Anxin has a boyfriend.

165
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,300
And she's still clinging onto Du Ming.

166
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,600
Is this news legit?

167
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,700
There was one time he got drunk and it slipped his mouth.

168
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,000
No way.

169
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,400
She said herself, "My boyfriend is out of the country. He doesn't come back often."

170
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,200
Isn't that hinting at Du Ming that he has a chance?

171
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,700
You can't really say that.

172
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,000
If Manager Du knows she has a boyfriend why is he like that?

173
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,800
If you don't believe it, why don't we personally check it out?

174
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,700
Sure!

175
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
- Anxin
- Yes?

176
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
After work, can we come over to your place?

177
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,600
I can make a hot pot for you all.

178
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,400
I can be an assistant.

179
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,000
How about another day? We can do anything on another day.

180
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,200
Are we not welcome?

181
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,400
That's not what I meant.

182
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,600
Then it's settled.

183
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,800
Manager Du, come with us.

184
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,100
Okay.

185
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,860
Anxin your home is quite far away.

186
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,360
Yeah, I have never came here before.

187
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,560
Yeah, I have also never come here before. There is also no traffic right now.

188
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,960
My coworkers are coming over. Leave!

189
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,990
Anxin

190
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,440
Who are you talking to?

191
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,620
No, I was just checking the time.

192
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,690
Don't play with your phone anymore, let's chat together.

193
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,460
Okay.

194
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,060
My coworkers are coming over. Leave!

195
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,230
We've arrived.

196
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,520
We've arrived?

197
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,330
Here?

198
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,980
Sir has been waiting for you

199
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,790
for a long time.

200
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,110
Surprise.

201
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,160
Bonjour, Madam.

202
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,710
Thank you...

203
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:41,060
How shall I address you?

204
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,540
- Ba.
 - Ba?

205
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:53,400
Mr. Ba, what is your relationship with Anxin?

206
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,490
We live together.

207
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,060
What relationship do you think we have?

208
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,930
It's over, the gods are fighting.

209
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,290
We'll be fine right? We're just watching the show?

210
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:22,150
Fight what? You have to be evenly matched to fight each other. But look at this.

211
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:25,960
Manager Du and this Mr. Ba are on complete different levels.

212
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:31,910
Anxin, didn't you say that your boyfriend is usually out of country?

213
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,030
Yeah

214
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,770
I just came back from out of the country.

215
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:38,680
But didn't think that friends would come over,

216
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,510
so I arranged seats for everyone last minute.

217
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:44,560
Also, we don't have to share all of our private matters

218
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,830
with coworkers. Right?

219
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,910
Right, yes.

220
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,920
Get the present for me, will you?

221
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,160
Just a small gift.

222
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,050
Please watch over Anxin a little more at work.

223
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,990
She's a little oblivious. She won't even know when she's being tricked.

224
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,530
What are you thinking about?

225
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,210
Be careful.

226
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,990
Alright.

227
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:44,010
Anxin, does your boyfriend have any single friends?

228
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,650
When I go back I'll ask for you.

229
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:50,680
Sadly I got married early so I don't have a chance.

230
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,960
Caring and romantic.

231
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,700
The key is that he's handsome.

232
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,180
Where did you find such a great boyfriend?

233
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,280
It's just that he's a bit arrogant.

234
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,390
We're leaving and he didn't even come see us out.

235
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:03,350
He is probably tired from the long flight.

236
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,220
Anxin go back quickly

237
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,350
to take good care of him.

238
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,520
- Then we're not going to take more of your time.
 - Drive safe!

239
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,510
Bye!

240
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,380
Bye!

241
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,200
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

242
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,860
Didn't I tell you to hide?

243
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,740
Then what?

244
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,580
You hide until after they leave and then come back.

245
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,200
Even if you get away with it this time, then what happens next time?

246
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,580
These coworkers were clearly trying to make you look bad.

247
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,190
What could I do.

248
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:47,400
We all work in the same building and will see each other everywhere.

249
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,570
The wintermelon-looking guy,

250
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,690
is he the one that gave you flowers?

251
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:54,380
Wintermelon?

252
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,880
His name is Du Ming.

253
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,480
Then what's up with this "foreign boyfriend?"

254
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,820
I don't have a foreign boyfriend.

255
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,080
It was just a way to avoid situations.

256
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,090
If I had one why would I let you stay here.

257
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:09,930
Now you can use my to avoid situations.

258
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:14,060
How about that? Isn't that easy?

259
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,550
It is.

260
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,790
Oh right.

261
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,000
How do you know so much?

262
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,030
Also, you bought perfume and prepared a Western meal.

263
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:32,110
Where did you get the money?

264
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,290
Did you win money again?

265
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,350
How much?

266
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:47,440
There's still $200,000. Take it.

267
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,620
How much is left?

268
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,760
$200.

269
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,860
$200?

270
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,430
There's only $200 left?

271
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,580
You're angry?

272
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,600
No.

273
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,350
This card was yours to begin with, the money was yours. What does that have to do with me?

274
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,010
I'm not angry.

275
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,320
I'm going to bed.

276
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,490
The money has already been spent. Furthermore, it wasn't yours.

277
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:46,860
Why do you care so much?

278
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,050
You can't really say that.

279
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,640
In any case, it was a huge sum of money.

280
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,540
It's just too wasteful.

281
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,660
Yeah.

282
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,610
Is it that fun?

283
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:35,010
It's alright. You want to try?

284
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:37,100
No need.

285
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:43,180
You don't look so good. Are you still mad at me?

286
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:47,630
Of course not. Of course I'm not mad at you.

287
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:50,710
If you aren't then come try this program.

288
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,190
[Big Bad Wolf and Little Sheep]

289
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,550
Here.

290
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,040
That's you?

291
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,030
Wow.

292
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,790
You like it?

293
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,870
Yes I do.

294
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:47,630
In the future you can use this to draw.

295
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:50,290
Even if there's an accident you won't have to worry about losing the drawing.

296
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,630
It will automatically save.

297
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,640
I suddenly know what you're doing.

298
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,420
Then you tell me. What am I doing?

299
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,080
You have a fun computer,

300
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,650
and you're normally so secretive.

301
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:13,000
You're a hacker.

302
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,720
You're overthinking it.

303
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,210
Are you still mad at me?

304
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,700
Still mad?

305
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,240
Still mad?

306
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,910
No I'm not.

307
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,690
I'm sleepy. I'm going to bed.

308
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,630
Good night.

309
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,170
You You?

310
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,380
Why are you tied up?

311
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,610
Who tied you up?

312
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,010
Anxin

313
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:59,930
Are you sure that handsome guy is not your boyfriend?

314
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:04,090
He's really not.

315
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,430
Then what happened to his leg?

316
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,520
Does he have a girlfriend?

317
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,020
It's a long story.

318
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,870
Wait, I wanted to ask you

319
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,700
Didn't you tell me before

320
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,840
that you were gonna be away for a bit longer?

321
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,780
It's also a long story for me! It's all because of my parents.

322
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,830
In order to force me to go home, they stopped all my cards.

323
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:28,900
I have nowhere to go because of this cold war with my parents.

324
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,070
Anxin!

325
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,340
Please let me stay here for a few days!

326
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,940
K.O.!

327
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,560
Sure!

328
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:41,660
Gu Anxin, help me take a shower.

329
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,800
Wait!

330
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,240
You two?

331
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,720
Are going to shower together?

332
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,390
No, it's not like that.

333
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,390
-Can we not shower today? 
-No!

334
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,620
No way...

335
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,580
I'm telling you guys—

336
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,610
-What are you doing? 
-What are you doing?

337
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,050
I... wanted to use the bathroom.

338
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,690
Why can't you use it later,

339
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:43,410
he still showering

340
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:48,110
Okay.

341
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,090
I'm sorry!

342
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,180
No way...

343
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,540
That is so interesting that you just took him home like that.

344
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,040
Even TV shows wouldn't plot like that.

345
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,540
What else can I do, I was the one that crashed into him.

346
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,250
I can't just leave him outside.

347
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,440
That is true.

348
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,160
But he is very good looking

349
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,080
and has a good figure. He can just debut now!

350
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:17,710
If I was the one that took him in...

351
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,250
Don't even dream about it.

352
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,470
Also,

353
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:25,740
what happens if he has a girlfriend.

354
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:29,020
Maybe not only is he single,

355
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:32,910
but he is a rich single batchelor!

356
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:35,510
Just like the main character in your manga!

357
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,890
You should wash up and go to bed. You're already dreaming.

358
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:46,370
Hey Anxin.

359
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:52,110
I see that he listens to you. Can you help me?

360
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,310
What?

361
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,490
I don't think that's a good idea.

362
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:05,040
Please Anxin! Please help me!

363
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,920
Okay, go to sleep.

364
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,980
I will try tomorrow.

365
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:34,650
Can you help me with something?

366
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,890
What?

367
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,920
Can you pretend to be You You's boyfriend for a day, and then

368
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,650
escape from her parent's questioning?

369
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,140
Okay.

370
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,540
Really?

371
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,520
That's great!

372
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,490
What do I need to do?

373
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,500
You don't need to do anything besides sit there.

374
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,820
Then Anxin should also go.

375
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,560
Why do I need to go? It's not necessary for me to.

376
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,180
No way, I already told my parents

377
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,050
that you were the one who introduced us both together.

378
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:16,090
Then of course need to see you.

379
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,380
Dad. Mom.

380
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,380
At first, I thought that brat was lying to us.

381
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,650
I didn't think it would be real.

382
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:40,160
You sure are good looking.

383
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,180
What's the point of being good looking?

384
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,060
The most important thing is to have good health.

385
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,920
Such a young age and already in a wheelchair.

386
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,520
Your mom and I are older and we aren't even sitting in a wheelchair.

387
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,210
Okay, Mom and Dad. Let's not argue. Since you already saw him, you can rest assure.

388
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:56,340
How is he, Mom? Are you satisified with him?

389
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,740
I am satisfied.

390
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,350
What do you do?

391
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,910
What does your family do? What are your plans for the future?

392
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:06,540
When do you plan on getting married to You You?

393
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:13,920
As long as she is willing, we can get married whenever she wants.

394
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,090
I'm currently preparing a tech company. In the future,

395
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,450
the company, including me,

396
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:21,120
belongs to her.

397
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,650
Let's eat!

398
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,620
Here Anxin

399
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,520
Eat, eat!

400
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,760
Okay, Anxin! Stop drinking!

401
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,730
Why are you drinking so much?

402
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,730
-There's no more? 
-There's no more.

403
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:06,080
Boss! Can you give us...

404
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,330
5 more bottles?

405
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,360
What are you sitting there for? Help me out.

406
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,580
Oh.

407
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:52,080
Ah! You can't sleep there, that's not your bed!

408
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,220
That's not your bed, that's my bed.

409
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,880
He is also mine.

410
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,530
Dear Anxin, 

411
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:12,340
Thank you for taking me in for the past few days. 

412
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,570
 Also! Let me tell you some good news. 

413
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:17,110
After so many years, I've finally had the chance to become a koi.*(experience good luck)

414
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:20,950
I have been chosen to go to London to attend Mike's fan meeting! 

415
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:23,370
I also hope that your love with Xiao Ba is sweet.

416
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:25,580
Coming back this time, I was very happy to see your changes.

417
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,180
Treasure that man. 

418
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,890
Love you always, You You. 

419
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:36,990
M-Monday?

420
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,050
-Good morning. 
-Good morning.

421
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,280
-Eat some breakfast.
-I'm in a rush to get to work.

422
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,650
I already asked for half a day off for you.

423
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:52,100
Why?

424
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,850
Do you remember what happened last night?

425
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,890
What happened?

426
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,880
 He is also mine. 

427
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:20,090
Anxin.

428
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:28,160
Manager Du, you didn't leave yet?

429
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,020
Anxin.

430
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:40,370
I like you.

431
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:42,720
You are drunk.

432
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,020
I am sober.

433
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,790
Y-You stand there. We can talk from there.

434
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:49,920
I like you sincerely.

435
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,090
Wait a second! Don't come over here!

436
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:54,030
Listen to me. You should give me a chance.

437
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,220
I- I don't come

438
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,060
-Don't cover over here! 
-Anxin.

439
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,130
-Listen to me! 
-Don't come over here!

440
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:02,430
-Give me a chance, please!
-Anxin!

441
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,350
Anxin!

442
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:07,180
Listen to me. Give me a chance!

443
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,020
I really like you. Anxin!

444
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:18,560
You hit me? Anxin!

445
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,460
Anxin! Anxin!

446
