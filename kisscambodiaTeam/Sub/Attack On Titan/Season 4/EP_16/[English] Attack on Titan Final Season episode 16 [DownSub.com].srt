That loud noise just now...

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,340
Was that thunder?

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,930
That was a thunder spear.

00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,000
What on earth happened?

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,600
Something must've happened
and caused that noise.

8
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,900
It's so... quiet.

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,590

22
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,740
I told you that
we’d get together soon again for dinner.

23
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,400
It turned out exactly as I said.
Right, Commander Pixis?

24
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,420
I'm grateful for your quick response.

25
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,210
You prohibited the military from
making any resistance

26
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,329
and assembled all your soldiers
here in Shiganshina as we requested.

27
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,200
You left me with no choice knowing
you dosed people with that spinal fluid.

28
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,000
We might turn into Titans at any moment.

29
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,310
There is no better place for us to be than
here, where all civilians have been evacuated.

30
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,440
Moreover...

31
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:50,500
What else can I do while I’m held at gunpoint?

32
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,230
Please forgive me, Commander.

33
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,450
My son and I have had that wine.

34
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,329
Since when did you decide to betray…

35
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,470
There is no need to answer him.

36
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,560
Please forgive me.

37
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,880
Looks like the earlier you switch sides,
the better your position here will be.

38
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:16,680
That white armband you wear so proudly
is a symbol indicating you're a Yeagerist, right?

39
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,950
Then I'm guessing the red indicates those
who were forced to submit

40
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,650
after learning that they'd drunk
the wine tainted with spinal fluid.

41
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:30,400
And finally, the majority are fools like us
who drank the wine unknowingly,

42
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,850
so we are wearing black armbands.

43
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,880
It’s just like what Marley would do.

44
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,250
Didn’t Marley control your homeland
with the same method?

45
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,200
We’ve learned a lot from our enemy.

46
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,290
Including how to make new
enemies, as it turned out.

47
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,659
Aren’t you the ones who
refused to let us join you?

48
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:58,050
We decided not to trust visitors
who came in bearing tainted wine.

49
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,880
I don't even know if that was
a wise choice or a foolish one.

50
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,340
You people are both foolish and wise.

51
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:12,150
If you had trusted us and Zeke,
the world could have been saved by now.

52
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,030
Did you say the world?

53
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,730
Isn't your plan to put Zeke and Eren
together and cause a small-scale Rumbling,

54
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,280
so as to show the nations of the world

55
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,380
that they can't lay a hand on
this island for the next fifty years?

56
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,800
But that’d only save this island.

57
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,400
Yelena?

58
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:42,020
It's already too late. Zeke already
gave you enough time to think it through.

59
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,560
And in exchange for his mercy,
you tried to stab him in the back.

60
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,130
Zeke is a god who will save the world.
You will be punished for that.

61
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:00,560
So there’s nothing we can do but wait and see?

62
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,640
Would you like some tea?

63
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,950
Thank you.

64
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,880
Armin, can you get out of here
with your Titan power?

65
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,840
I can't.

66
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,050
I can only blow this town up.

67
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,940
Colossal Titan can't do
something that agile.

68
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,920
I can’t do what Eren did.

69
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,560
So why did Eren beat you up?

70
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,220
Can't you tell us already?

71
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,210
He hurt Mikasa with his words.

72
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,470
So I attacked him, and he fought back.

73
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,520
Huh?

74
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,330
He hurt Mikasa with his words? What did he say?

75
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,980
-Well...
-Stop it.

76
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,400
It's fine.

77
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,040
No, it's not.

78
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,200
Tell us how he hurt her.

79
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,570
Hey, that’s enough, Jean!

80
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,340
That means he already turned
into a total piece of shit.

81
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,410
He already lost sight of who he is,

82
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,170
to the point that he'd pointlessly hurt
the two people whom he used to care about most.

83
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:09,330
If he was still sane, I doubt he would
do something like that for no reason.

84
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,520
Maybe he had some sort of hidden motive.

85
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,140
Long time no see.

86
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,380
Heroes of Shiganshina.

87
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,870
It pains me that
we must reunite at a place like this.

88
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,710
Hey...

89
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,280
You're on their side, too?

90
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,540
Get us out of here!

91
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,550
You all put me under arrest and
dragged me all around the island.

92
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,159
Do you think I’d just listen
to you guys like that?

93
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,300
Just sit and wait here until
Zeke and Eren come into contact.

94
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,950
You...

95
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,770
Good for you, Yelena.

96
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,320
You must be pleased that
everything went well.

97
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,280
Through you, Eren moved
according to Zeke's plan.

98
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,240
You got your attack on Marley.
You’ve gained the Eldians’ support,

99
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,940
and you’ve taken control of the military
with that spinal fluid-infused wine.

100
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,530
Now you have the Eldia nation and
the power of the Founding Titan.

101
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,570
You can finally destroy Marley and
get revenge for your motherland.

102
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:10,990
That is the true reason why
you came to this island, isn't it?

103
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,480
We helped improve this island.

104
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,060
This primitive island was a century behind.

105
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:16,860
Huh?

106
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,490
It’s all because
you want to live a luxury life here!

107
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,560
Once you become the rulers of this island…

108
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,390
You got tricked and lost. That's all.

109
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,810
Griez...

110
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,880
Seems like you just got promoted
as Yelena's servant by betraying us.

111
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,409
You little rat!

112
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,909
Are you stupid?

113
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:39,870
You're the real traitor who
sided with the devils!

114
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:40,919
What?

115
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:45,310
You were smitten with some
devil-blooded potato-grubbing girl!

116
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,210
I will kill you!

117
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,500
Stop it, Niccolo!

118
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,770
You talked about that girl to me every night.

119
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,900
I was a fool for thinking you'd come back
to your senses after that whore died.

120
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,390
What the hell did you just say?

121
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,340
I will put it in a way you can understand.

122
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,400
That whore was the daughter of a de…

123
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,720
Yelena?

124
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,630
I apologize for his rudeness.

125
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,950
This island no longer needs
those who would curse you as devils.

126
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,450
And please believe me.

127
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:23,770
Our true intention is never as
hollow as taking revenge on Marley.

128
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:30,580
It is to sever the chains of hate from this world
and save not only Eldia, but Marley as well.

129
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,310
I will explain everything to you
without holding back.

130
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,790
Zeke's plan of saving the world...

131
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,580
The euthanasia plan.

132
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,050
But they're devils...

133
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,290
Why must this happen to me?

134
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,930
Hey, you brat who killed Sasha.

135
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,100
What do you want?

136
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,710
If you want to save Falco, work with me.

137
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,320
Work... with you?

138
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,610
How?

139
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,770
I want you to radio for help.

140
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,320
Lure out the spies
who've infiltrated the walls.

141
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,690
Don't move.

142
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,030
Gabi, stay quiet.

143
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,360
Ms. Pieck!

144
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,600
Quiet.

145
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,920
So, you are Eren Yeager,

146
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,910
right?

156
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:04,230
Have you never seen that?
You won't even have time to transform.

157
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,550
So?

158
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,140
What are you waiting for?

159
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,390
If don't shoot me,
what’s your purpose of being here?

160
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,180
What if I refuse to take my hands out?

161
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,760
You won't know what will happen,

162

not until your brains…

163
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,530
No, I know

164
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,930
you won't shoot me.

165
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:23,530
You don't have the permission
to kill the Founding Titan.

166
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,460
Your order is to retrieve the Founding Titan
no matter what.

167
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:33,990
Even now, you still have to turn into
a Titan first before you gulp me down.

168
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,910
Right?

169
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,910

Do not pull that trigger!

172
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,740
If you breach such a severe military law,

173
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,860
your family in the internment zone would
have to pay the price alongside you.

00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,390
Yes, I can't shoot.

175
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,740
I doubt I can eat you alive either.

176
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,170
Anyway...

177
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,140
Ms. Pieck?

178
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:05,600
You found my Titan's tracks I left
when I snuck in here, didn't you?

179
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:11,950
My plan was to get as near as I can
before you could react. I was lucky.

180
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,420
But there's another reason I couldn't shoot.

181
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,910
If you can use the Founding Titan, I figure
you might be able to defeat Marley.

182
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:28,820
You won’t go against the world
without any chance of winning, right?

183
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,800
But aside from the power of the Founding Titan,
what else do you have?

184
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,780
Ms. Pieck? What are you saying?

185
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,270
Gabi. Put the rifle down.

186
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,780
Then what do you want?

187
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:47,000
To free the Eldians from subjugation
by Marley and the rest of the world.

188
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,540
I want to get my family out of
the internment zone as soon as possible.

189
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:58,180
I became a Warrior so I can get my father, my one
and only family, a proper medical treatment.

190
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,140
My father survived,

191
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,480
but he'd been living in misery since
he learned that my tenure would end soon.

192
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,590
Before I die and leave him all alone,

193
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,630
I want to show him a brighter future
for Eldia with my own hands.

194
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,300
And to do that, I need to crush Marley.

195
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,180
I will help you with anything,

196
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,500
if that's what it takes to kill all Marleyan.

197
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:33,950
The mastermind behind
the attack on Marley was Mr. Zeke.

198
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,660
You too, Ms. Pieck?

199
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,770
What have we been fighting for?

200
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,880
I thought that if the world realized
we were good Eldians...

201
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,500
....someday... Eldians would be free!

202
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:51,290
Are you a traitor just like Zeke?

203
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,400
Gabi.

204
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,390
Are we Marleyans? Or are we Eldians?

205
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,100
What do you think?

206
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,890
We are.... Honorary Marleyans...

207
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,020
No, we're the Subjects of Ymir.

208
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,660
That is our inescapable truth.

209
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,760
No matter what we call us,
we are people who can become Titans.

210
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:21,100
Like what you saw in Fort Slava, someday,
the Titan power will no longer work.

211
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:26,560
In other words, Marley will be
done with us and kill us all!

212
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:33,670
No matter how you prove you're
a good Eldian, they will never let us free!

213
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,340
We must win our rights with our own hands.

214
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,050
Prove it.

215
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:46,650
If you're really going to join
our side, show us some proof.

216
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,860
I will tell you where my allies
are hiding in this town.

217
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,800
How?

218
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,560
Just take me to the rooftop.
I can show you where they are.

219
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,600
Fine.

220
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:04,210
Won’t be able to bear children…?

221
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,190
Yes. That is Zeke's euthanasia plan.

222
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:14,080
No more pain will come to this world
due to the existence of Titans.

223
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:17,540
Slowly... and peacefully.

224
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:20,060
No, wait. How can that be peaceful?

225
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,870
If the population of Subjects of Ymir
keep shrinking until it vanishes...

226
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,990
Only the elderly will be left
during this country's last years!

227
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,530
How can our country be protected by then?

228
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,670
You think all other countries
will just stay silent?

229
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,080
It will be just like what it has always been.

230
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,660
The Rumbling will act as a deterrent force,

231
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:39,790
so both the Founding Titan and the royal
family need to be maintained.

232
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:44,690
Fortunately, Queen Historia has
already been blessed with a successor.

233
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,880
Until that child passes from this world,

234
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,830
a few Subjects of Ymir must inherit
the Founding Titan.

235
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,030
And you think that it's fool-proof?

236
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:59,280
Fool-proof? Absolute?
No nation out there has such a thing.

237
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,260
All countries have their problems.

238
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,800
But there is one thing that's certain-
the great threat of the Titans.

239
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:13,870
The fact that two men stepped forward to put
an end to this history of blood and tears.

240
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,400
Zeke and Eren.

241
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,890
I don't know how many millennia
human history still has,

242
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,060
but will anyone who can accomplish
such a feat appear in the future?

243
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:30,400
Those brothers will be remembered as
symbols for thousands of years to come.

244
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,960
Just like we still talk about the ancient gods to this day.

245
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:39,570
Even after their death, they will shine
like the sun as the saviors of humanity…

246
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,020
Is something wrong?

247
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,780
I didn't know... they had
such a noble intention...

248
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,810
I'm so moved.

249
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,530
That's great.

250
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,120
I'm happy that you understand.

251
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,280
Yelena!

252
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,240
Please come right away.
We have intruders!

253
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,410
The enemy has infiltrated the base!

254
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,460
I’ve lost one man!

255
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,319
It's the one with the Cart Titan!

256
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:11,150
What?

257
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,500
But it’s said she betrayed Marley.

258
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:18,030
What's happening?
What's with the noise outside?

259
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,220
Does this mean I'm now officially
part of your group?

260
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,079
After you hand us the other
intruders, that is.

261
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,510
Until then, you and the kid will be cuffed.

262
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:36,360
If you transform into a Titan,
she will get smashed into pieces.

263
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,460
It's fine.

264
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,680
I'm sure she will understand soon.

265
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,320
So that small woman is
a Marleyan soldier?

266
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,420
She's on our side?

267
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,500
Hey there!

268
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,030
Umm...

269
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,490
Where's Falco?

270
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,520
Falco's here, too.

271
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:04,600
But he ingested some of Zeke's spinal fluid.

272
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,330
What do you mean?

273
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,570
Who knows?

274
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,750
Just that some of that wine
got into his mouth.

275
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,360
Could it be at that time...

276
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,600
Gabi?

277
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,080
It's my fault...

278
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,150
Again...

279
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,080
I see.

280
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:26,250
So you took control of the military
using Zeke's spinal liquid.

281
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,960
Do you know why Zeke has such
a unique ability?

282
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,320
Who knows?

283
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,280
Do you?

284
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,190
No.

285
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,960
No one knows.

286
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,280
Except for Zeke.

287
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,330
I always think that Zeke is a liar.

288
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,760
But four years ago,
I confirmed my suspicions.

289
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,250
Because when he saw you,
he told the truth for the first time.

290
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,070
"Please believe me."

291
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,800
"I understand you."

292
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,800
"Eren, I will surely save you one day."

293
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,810
I believe he'll tell you the secret of
his power because he wouldn't lie to you.

294
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,490
And maybe that secret...

295
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,490
...is connected to how to draw out
the power of the Founding Titan.

296
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,040
Oh my.

297
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,960
You shaved your goatee?

298
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,550
It looked great on you though.

299
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,060
Eren.

300
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,040
You shouldn't trust that woman.

301
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,680
She's too dangerous.

302
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,070
Yeah.

303
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,990
I don't trust her,
and she doesn't trust me either.

304
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,540
By the way, you are still not going
to use the Founding Titan's power?

305
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,740
Where's Zeke?

306
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,700
You will find out soon.

307
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,360
Show us.

308
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,050
Where's the enemy?

309
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,610
Over there.

310
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,220
What happened?

311
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,970
It started...

312
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,390
The Titans...

313
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,350
...are moving!

314
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,860
Mr. Galliard?

315
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,580
It’s not as easy as I thought.

316
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:17,140
Ms. Pieck? Didn't you betray us?

317
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:20,310
Gabi, you seriously think I would
betray my friends?

318
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,430
But you said we won’t have a future
even if we keep serving Marley.

319
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,550
Look.

320
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,620
I don't trust Marley.

321
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:36,540
I trust my friends whom
I fought alongside.

322
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,380
The signal is up.

323
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,830
Pieck and Galliard have exposed
that bastard's location!

324
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,770
That's the Founding Titan.

325
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,860
Time to get revenge for Liberio!

326
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,450
We will end him right here.

327
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,490
Come.

328
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,160
