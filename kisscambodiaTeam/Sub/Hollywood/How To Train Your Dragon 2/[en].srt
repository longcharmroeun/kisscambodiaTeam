184
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:38,930
I've decided..."
To make you chief!
Oh, my gods!

185
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:41,099
Hiccup, that's amazing!

186
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,701
oh...!

187
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,003
Y-you're gonna wear
out the spring coil.

188
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:47,305
The calibration
is very sensitive.

189
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:56,781
Yeah, so... this is
what I'm dealing with.

190
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,049
What did you tell him?

191
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,417
I-I didn't.

192
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:00,819
By the time he turned
around, I was gone.

193
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,187
Huh.

194
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:05,990
Well... it's a lot
of responsibility.

195
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:08,293
The map will have
to wait, for sure,

196
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:09,928
and... and I'll need

197
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,831
to fly toothless, since
you'll be too busy, but...

198
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,336
I-it's not me, Astrid.

199
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:21,506
All those speeches and planning
and running the village,

200
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,141
that's his thing.

201
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:25,343
I think you're
missing the point.

202
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:26,945
I mean-- chief.

203
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:28,379
What an honor!

204
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:29,948
I'd be pretty excited.

205
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,851
I-I... I'm not like you.

206
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,120
You... know exactly
who you are,

207
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:39,491
you always have, but...
I'm still looking.

208
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:42,260
I know that I'm
not my father,

209
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,296
and I never met
my mother, so...

210
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,432
What does that make me?

211
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:57,375
What you're searching for
isn't out there, hiccup...

212
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,944
It's in here.

213
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:03,081
Maybe you just
don't see it yet.

214
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,116
Ugh. Ugh!
Maybe.

215
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,918
But, you know...

216
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,788
There is something

239
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,187
That is a night fury.

240
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:51,289
Thought they were
all gone for good.

241
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,024
Looks like our
luck's had a turn

242
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,392
for the better, lads!

243
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,361
Don't think drago
has one of those...

244
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,196
In his dragon army.

245
00:14:58,198 --> 00:14:59,497
Dragon army?

246
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,499
Look, we don't
want any trouble.

247
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,935
Hah! You should
have thought of that

248
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:06,404
before you stole
all of our dragons

249
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,972
and blasted our
fort to bits!

250
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:09,674
MAN: That's right!
MAN 2: Yeah, look it at!

00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:11,109
HICCUP:
Wait.

252
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,343
What are you
talking about?

253
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:13,978
You think we did this?

254
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,582
Hah! Dragon trapping is
hard enough work as it is

255
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,018
without do-gooder dragon riders

256
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,988
sneaking in to rescue them.
What do-gooder...?

257
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,658
There are other dragon riders?
You mean

258
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,560
other than your thieving friend
from last night? You tell me.

259
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,029
You may have

260
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,664
an ice-spitting dragon
on your side,

261
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,233
but we still have
a quota to fill.

262
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,468
How do you suppose
we explain this mess

263
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,003
to drago bludvist?

264
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,505
Drago what-fist?

265
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:42,507
Does anything you
say make sense?

266
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,342
He's expecting
a new shipment of dragons

267
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,544
for his army by tomorrow.

268
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:50,248
And drago don't
take well to excuses!

269
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,083
This is what he gave me

270
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:54,452
last time I showed up
empty-handed.

271
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:58,556
He promised to be far less
understanding in the future.

272
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:01,426
All right, look, we don't know
anything about a dragon thief

273
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:02,694
or an ice-spitting dragon

274
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:04,696
or your lunatic boss

275
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:07,131
and his dragon army, okay?

276
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:10,234
Just give us back our dragon,
and we'll go...

277
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:13,037
Strange, hostile person
whom we've never met.

278
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,039
Oh, where are my manners?

279
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:19,243
I'm eret... Son of eret.

280
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,512
Finest dragon trapper alive.

281
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,314
OTHERS: Yeah.
After all...

282
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:27,285
It's not just anyone
who can capture a night fury.

283
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,320
And this is toothless.

284
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,589
He says we're going. Now.

285
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:32,724
Hah!

286
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:34,325
They all say that.

287
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,593
Rush 'em, lads!

288
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,068
ASTRID:
Stormfly, come on!

289
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,336
Go! Go!

290
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,210
You will never hold
on to those dragons!

291
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:53,511
You hear me?!

292
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,280
Drago is coming for them all!

293
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:02,553
Come on, meatlug!
Whoo-hoo!
Yahoo!

294
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,296
Hey there, stoick!
Hey, how are you?

295
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:13,765
Beautiful day.

296
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:16,067
Hello, spitelout. Great race.
Yeah...

297
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,635
Oh! Sorry, Mrs. ack.

298
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:20,338
: Any sign of him?
Eh! He's probably flown

299
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,640
off the edge
of the world by now.

300
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:25,109
You sure you want that kid
running the village?

301
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:27,211
You can still delay
your retirement.

302
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,781
Oh, he's ready.
You'll see.

303
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:32,383
there he is!

304
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:35,053
Huh?
The pride of berk!

305
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,657
Who finally decided
to show up for work. Yay.

306
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,426
Sorry, got held up.
Hey, uh, dad,

307
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:42,760
could I have a word?

308
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,429
Something you're
itching to tell me?

309
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:47,465
Uh, not quite the itch
you're thinking of, but, yes.

310
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,666
Oh, good man!

311
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:50,701
NOW, LESSON ONE:
A chief's first duty

312
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:53,404
is to his people, so... 41!

313
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,273
Well, can we just
talk in private for...

314
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,307
Forty...
MAN: That's me!

315
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,542
That's me! I'm next!

316
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:58,609
MAN 2: Hey, I was
ahead of you!

317
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:00,111
If we could just talk...

318
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:02,180
Excuse me.
I've been here all day.

319
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:04,549
Okay, okay, I want one
of those high seaters

320
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:07,819
with lots of spikes and a
big storage compartment!

321
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:11,322
Absolutely! You got it, sir.
Dad, this is actually

322
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,124
a little more important
than building saddles.

323
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:15,293
AH, LESSON TWO:
No task is too small

324
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,195
when it comes
to serving your people.

325
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:19,297
But, dad...
Oh, excuse us, grump.

326
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,599
Can we just talk...
Yah! Grump!

327
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,835
You let the forge
die down again!

328
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,674
Ah...

329
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,709
GOBBER: That's it, grump!
You're going up for adoption.

330
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,311
Okay, uh...
There you go.

331
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,580
Dad... yeah, but seriously,
go on. Have away.

332
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:40,118
I really need to tell you about
this new land we came across.

333
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,786
Another one?
Any new dragons?

334
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,654
We didn't stick
around to find out.

335
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:46,424
These folks weren't
particularly friendly.

336
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:47,592
GOBBER:
Oh, really?

337
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,360
Your night fury
and deadly nadder

338
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:51,829
didn't bring them
cheering to the rooftops?

339
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,364
No, this was different.

340
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:55,333
Not the standard
run-for-the-hills hoo-ha

341
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:56,667
I've come to enjoy.

342
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:59,604
These guys were trappers.

343
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,372
Dragon trappers.

344
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:02,807
You should have seen their fort.

345
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,810
All blown apart and stuck
in giant spikes of ice.

346
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,278
It was weird.

347
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,880
I've never seen
anything like it.

348
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:11,549
A-and worst of all,
they thought we did it!

349
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:14,385
You know, you two are gonna get
yourselves in serious trouble

350
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:15,720
one of these days.

351
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:18,890
Not everyone appreciates
this way of life.

352
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:20,191
Aye, gobber's
right, son.

353
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,859
Best we keep to our own.

354
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:24,929
Besides, you'll have more
important uses for your time.

355
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,764
Huh-huh?

356
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:29,667
Once we make
the big announcement!

357
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,670
They are building
a dragon army.

358
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:37,708
Or-or at least the guy
they work for is. Uh...

359
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,545
"Dargo... bloody fist"

540
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,227
♪ ♪

541
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,097
hey!

542
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,866
You left my dragon back there!

543
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:31,301
He can't fly on his own!
He'll drown!

544
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,793
Hey! Uh...

545
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,828
We have to head back
for my dragon!

546
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:46,009
Who are you?

547
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:48,879
The dragon thief?

548
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:52,583
Uh... Drago bludvist?

549
00:30:52,585 --> 00:30:56,486
Do you even understand
what I'm saying?

550
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,227
Toothless!

551
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:06,029
Oh, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

552
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,131
I'm glad to see you,
too, bud.

553
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,366
You really had me worried there.

554
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,538
Uh, uh...

555
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,179
:
Oh...

556
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:57,481
:
Hiccup?

557
00:31:57,483 --> 00:31:59,383
Uh...

558
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:03,654
C-could it be?

559
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:06,990
After all these years?

560
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:09,493
How is this possible?

561
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:13,463
Uh, should I...
Should I know you?

562
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:15,632
No.

563
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:17,334
You were only a babe.

564
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,442
But a mother never forgets.

565
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:31,148
Shh, shh.

566
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,352
Come.

567
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:37,187
STOICK:
Boar-headed!

568
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:38,522
Just like his mother!

569
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:40,524
Aye, she could never
stay put, either.

570
00:32:40,526 --> 00:32:41,591
GOBBER:
Eh, he's just 20,

571
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:43,160
and a viking.

572
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:44,628
I mean, could there be
a worse combination?

573
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:48,131
Heh! When I think
of how stubborn and senseless

574
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,567
you were back in the day.

575
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,269
Oh.

576
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:55,005
Well, not much
has changed, actually.

577
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:58,241
Ah, you know what he's like.

578
00:32:58,243 --> 00:33:00,110
He won't give up, gobber.

579
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:02,713
And if hiccup finds drago

580
00:33:02,715 --> 00:33:05,048
before we find him...

581
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,583
Ah!
Nothing can hurt hiccup,

582
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:08,719
so long as that
night fury's around.

583
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:10,187
It's a night fury!

584
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:16,259
Huh?

585
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,441
Find them, skullcrusher.

586
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:34,478
Find them.

587
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,687
Uh, h-hold on.
Wait just a minute.

588
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,088
This way.
Come back here.

589
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,723
Come.
You can't just say

590
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:49,026
something like that and run off.

591
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:50,494
You're my mother?!

592
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:52,095
I mean, what the...?

593
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:54,131
Do you... do you grasp how
insane it sounds?

594
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:55,365
Come quickly.

595
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,533
I have questions!

596
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,402
where have you...

597
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:00,404
Been all this time?

598
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:03,407
What-what have you been doing?

599
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:06,343
But they-they said
you were dead!

600
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:08,678
Everyone thinks
you were eaten by...

601
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:52,789
This is where you've been
for 20 years?

602
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,794
You-you've been rescuing them.

603
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,632
Unbelievable.

604
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:04,367
You're not upset?
What?

605
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:06,169
No. I-I don't know. I...

606
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:08,839
It's a bit much to get
my head around, to be frank.

607
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:11,708
It's not every day you find out
your mother

608
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:15,879
is some kind of crazy, feral,
vigilante dragon lady.

609
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:18,281
Oh...

610
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,883
Well...

611
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:23,453
At least I'm not boring, right?

612
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,222
Well, I suppose there is that...

613
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:28,325
One specific thing.

614
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:30,160
Do-do you like it?

615
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:34,464
I... I... I... I-I
don't have the words.

616
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:46,877
C-can I... Oh, he's beautiful.

617
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:48,478
Oh.

618
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:51,314
Oh, incredible.

619
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:55,886
He might very well be
the last of his kind.

620
00:35:55,888 --> 00:35:59,890
Oh... and look, he's your age.

621
00:35:59,892 --> 00:36:01,291
Wow.

622
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:03,160
No wonder you get
along so well.

623
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:04,494
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?

624
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:08,899
And retractable teeth.

625
00:36:08,901 --> 00:36:11,201
How did you manage...

626
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:12,736
I found him in the woods.

627
00:36:12,738 --> 00:36:16,306
He was shot down
and wounded.

628
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:22,679
This snafflefang lost his leg

629
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,382
to one of drago bludvist's
iron traps.

630
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:26,850
This raincutter

631
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:29,219
had her wing sliced
by razor netting.

632
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:31,588
And this, oh, poor hobblegrunt

633
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,491
was blinded by a tree snare

634
00:36:34,493 --> 00:36:37,727
and then left to die alone
and scared.

635
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:39,796
And what of this?

636
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:42,799
Did drago or his trappers
do this, too?

637
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:44,334
oh.

638
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:45,835
Yeah.

639
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:49,573
Well, crazy thing is...

640
00:36:49,575 --> 00:36:53,510
I'm actually the one
who shot him down.

641
00:36:53,512 --> 00:36:56,279
Hey, it's-it's okay, though.

642
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:57,347
He got me back.

643
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:58,748
Right, bud?

644
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,717
You couldn't save
all of me, could you?

645
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,485
You just had to make it even.

646
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:05,355
So peg leg.

647
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:10,460
uh...

648
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:12,963
What did your father think
of your night fury friend?

649
00:37:12,965 --> 00:37:15,999
Oh, he-he didn't take
it all that well.

650
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:19,869
But then, he changed.

651
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:21,004
They all did.

652
00:37:21,006 --> 00:37:22,606
Pretty soon,

653
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:25,442
everyone back home had
dragons of their own.

654
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:27,644
If only it were possible.

655
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:28,745
No, really.

656
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,814
Believe me, I tried, as well,

657
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:33,850
but people are not capable
of change, hiccup.

658
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:35,385
Some of us...

659
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:37,654
were just born different.

660
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:46,863
MOTHER:
Berk was a land of kill

661
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:48,431
or be killed,

662
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:51,401
but I believed peace
was possible.

663
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:55,672
Stop!
You'll only make it worse!

664
00:37:55,674 --> 00:37:59,342
MOTHER:
It was a very
unpopular opinion.

665
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,512
Hiccup!

666
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:04,314
MOTHER:
Then one night,

667
00:38:04,316 --> 00:38:07,417
a dragon broke into our
house, finding you

668
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:08,985
in the cradle.

669
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:12,355
I rushed to protect you.

670
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:21,331
But what I saw was proof
of everything I believed.

671
00:38:34,046 --> 00:38:36,746
This wasn't a vicious beast,

672
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:39,683
but an intelligent,
gentle creature,

673
00:38:39,685 --> 00:38:43,386
whose soul reflected my own.

674
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:48,391
Valka, run!
No, don't.

675
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:54,064
Oh... Hold on!

676
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:58,101
No! Aah! Stoick!

677
00:38:58,103 --> 00:39:00,470
STOICK:
Valka!

678
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:04,074
Stoick!

679
00:39:04,076 --> 00:39:06,810
Valka.

680
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:10,080
VALKA:
You and your father
nearly died

681
00:39:10,082 --> 00:39:11,681
that night.

682
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,684
All because
I couldn't kill a dragon.

683
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:17,887
Eh, runs in the family.

684
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:19,956
It broke my heart to stay away,

685
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:23,426
but I believed
you'd be safer if I did.

686
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,563
How did you survive?

687
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:28,832
Oh, cloudjumper never meant
to harm me.

688
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:32,969
He must have thought
I belonged here

689
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:36,906
in the home of the
great bewilderbeast.

690
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,110
The Alpha species.

691
00:39:40,112 --> 00:39:43,947
One of the very few
that still exist.

692
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:47,684
Every nest has its queen,

693
00:39:47,686 --> 00:39:51,121
but this is the king
of all dragons.

694
00:39:51,123 --> 00:39:53,523
With his icy breath,

695
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:56,126
this graceful giant
built our nest,

696
00:39:56,128 --> 00:39:59,562
a safe haven for
dragons everywhere.

697
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,865
Wait, that's the ice-spitter?

698
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:04,901
He's responsible for
all that destruction?

699
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,770
He protects us.

700
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:10,940
We all live under his
care and his command.

701
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:16,012
VALKA: All but the babies,
of course...

702
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:20,617
...who listen to no one.

703
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,555
Aw...

704
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,533
I've lived among them
for 20 years, hiccup,

705
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:39,135
discovering their secrets.

706
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:44,674
he likes you.

707
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:46,176
Wow.

708
00:40:46,178 --> 00:40:47,710
You must be hungry.

709
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:49,479
Uh, yeah, I could eat.

710
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:50,480
Good.

711
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:51,881
It's feeding time.

712
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:02,625
I don't like it.

713
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,761
They should've been back
with hiccup by now.

714
00:41:04,763 --> 00:41:05,929
I don't like it, either.

715
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:07,030
eret, son of eret,

716
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:08,798
was the man of my dreams.

717
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,200
My everything!

718
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:12,669
But, baby,
I grew facial hair for you.

719
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:14,604
Me, too.

720
00:41:14,606 --> 00:41:16,105
What if drago shot them down?

721
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:18,808
What if they need our help?

722
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,577
We have to find them.

723
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:21,611
Wait, wait, what?

724
00:41:21,613 --> 00:41:22,779
No, but stoick said...

725
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:24,013
It doesn't matter
what he said

726
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,215
if they've all been captured.

727
00:41:25,217 --> 00:41:26,583
Come on!

728
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,688
NO-NAME:
Do we go back?

729
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:32,956
ERET:
We've nowhere to go,

730
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:34,958
nothing to sell, and no heads

731
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,226
to call our own.

732
00:41:36,228 --> 00:41:37,861
Uh, eret...?
If we don't turn up

733
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:40,230
with dragons and fast...

734
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:43,766
Careful what you wish for!

735
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:45,535
Do something!
Eret, son of eret!

736
00:41:45,537 --> 00:41:46,536
We'll miss you, eret!

737
00:41:46,538 --> 00:41:47,537
What is this?

738
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:48,705
A kidnapping.

739
00:41:48,707 --> 00:41:50,240
Yay, can he ride with me?
Can he?

740
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:51,541
:
Can he...?

741
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:54,911
You're gonna show us
the way to drago.

742
00:41:54,913 --> 00:41:56,579
And help dragon riders

743
00:41:56,581 --> 00:41:58,081
sneak into drago's camp?

744
00:41:58,083 --> 00:41:59,148
Just kill me now.

745
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,250
That could be arranged.

746
00:42:00,252 --> 00:42:01,918
Stormfly, drop it.

747
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,586
Huh?

748
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:05,855
Good girl!

749
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:08,892
Stormfly, fetch.

750
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:10,994
All right!

751
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:13,963
Okay! I'll take you to drago!

752
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,600
Works every time.

Oh, we are.

755
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:04,113
And then, from dragon island,
I found this archipelago...

756
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:12,922
There.

00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,658

every dragon

784
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:08,331

No.

throne of berk,

right now,

867
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:07,496
and now all of berk?

868
00:51:07,498 --> 00:51:10,399
And you led them to me!

We must attack
the dragon riders' nest at once!

872
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:23,579
We will take down their Alpha.

873
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:27,483
Then we will take berk!

886
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:22,838

All clear.

887
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,306
Toothless, come.
Uh, wait, uh, wait...

888
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:26,475
Okay, uh, dad,
there-there's something

889
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,544
you need to know.
Yeah, yeah,
tell me on the way.

890
00:52:28,546 --> 00:52:31,547
Well, this isn't an "on the way"
kind of update, actually.

891

I spring on you,

this is one you'll like,

So... Uh...

900
00:52:50,368 --> 00:52:53,536
