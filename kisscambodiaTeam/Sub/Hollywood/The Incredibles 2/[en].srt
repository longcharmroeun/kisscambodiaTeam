the program shut down.

285
00:14:46,395 --> 00:14:48,294
How much longer
are you in this motel?

286
00:14:48,296 --> 00:14:49,562
Two weeks.

You're very generous,
but there are five of us.

We wouldn't do that
to you and Honey.

ask you something.

389
00:19:09,658 --> 00:19:11,491
What is the main reason

390
00:19:11,493 --> 00:19:13,060
you were all
forced underground?

391
00:19:13,062 --> 00:19:15,129
- Ignorance.
- Perception.

392
00:19:15,131 --> 00:19:17,664
Take today for example,
with the Underminer.

393

Difficult situation.

394

lot of hard decisions.

395
00:19:21,503 --> 00:19:22,669
Oh, tell me about it.

396

neither did anyone else.

399
00:19:28,177 --> 00:19:30,576
So, when you fight bad
guys like today...

400
00:19:30,578 --> 00:19:33,213
people don't see the fight
or what led up to it.

401
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:35,816
They see what politicians
tell them to see.

402
00:19:35,818 --> 00:19:38,718
They see destruction
and they see you.

So, if we wanna change

404
00:19:40,122 --> 00:19:42,923
people's perceptions
about superheroes...

405
