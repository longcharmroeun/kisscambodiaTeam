1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:01:07,640
watch on kisskh.me

2
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,130
Sometimes,
I think I'm cursed.

3
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,770
Because of something that
happened before I was even born.

4
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,120
See, a long time ago,
there was this family.

5
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,140
The papa, he was a musician.

6
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,990
He and his family would sing and
dance and count their blessings.

7
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,780
But he also had a dream.
To play for the world.

8
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,160
And one day,

9
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,160
he left with his guitar
and never returned.

10
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,170
And the mama...

11
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,840
She didn't have time to cry
over that walk-away musician.

12
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,280
After banishing all music from
her life she found a way...

13
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,900
to provide for her daughter.

14
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,190
She rolled up her sleeves
and she learned to make shoes.

15
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,630
She could have made candy,

16
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,730
or fireworks,
or sparkly underwear...

17
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:26,050
for wrestlers,
but no, she chose shoes.

18
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,920
Then she taught her daughter
to make shoes.

19
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,890
And later,
she taught her son-in-law.

20
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,880
Then her grandkids
got roped in.

21
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,540
As her family grew,
so did the business.

22
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,810
Music had torn
her family apart.

23
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,940
But shoes held
them all together.

24
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,260
You see, that woman was

25
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,810
my great-great-grandmother,
Mama Imelda.

26
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,640
She died
way before I was born.

27
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,810
But my family
still tells her story

28
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,380
every year
on Dia de los Muertos...

29
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,880
the Day of the Dead.

30
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,780
And her little girl,

31
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,230
she's my great-grandmother,
Mama Coco.

32
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,820
Hola, Mama Coco.

33
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,350
How are you, Julio?

34
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,520
Actually, my name is Miguel.

35
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,360
Mama Coco has trouble
remembering things.

36
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,390
But it's good
to talk to her anyway.

37
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,530
So, I tell her
pretty much everything.

38
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,270
I used to run like this.

39
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,270
But now I run like this
which is way faster.

40
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,440
And the winner
is Luchadora Coco!

41
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,570
I have a dimple on this side,
but not on this side.

42
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,540
Dimple, no dimple.
Dimple, no dimple.

43
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,780
Miguel, eat your food.

44
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,410
My abuelita,
she's Mama Coco's daughter.

45
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,550
Oh, you're a twig, mijo.
Have some more.

46
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,690
No, gracias.

47
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,920
I asked if you would
like more tamales!

48
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,290
Si?

49
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,860
That's what
I thought you said!

50
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,430
Abuelita runs our house

51
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,300
just like Mama Imelda did.

52
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,300
No music!

53
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,840
No music!

54
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,700
♪ Y aunque la vida ♪

55
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,010
No music!

56
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,440
I think we're
the only family in Mexico

57
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,410
who hates music.

58
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,410
And my family's fine
with that. But me...

59
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,760
- Be back by lunch, mijo.
- Love you, Mama.

60
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,330
I am not like
the rest of my family!

61
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,990
- Hola, Miguel!
- Hola!

62
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,180
- Muchas gracias.
- De nada, Miguel.

63
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,750
Hey! Dante!

64
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,920
Sit. Down.
Roll over. Shake.

65
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,710
Fist bump!

66
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,930
Good boy, Dante!

67
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,120
I know I'm not
supposed to love music.

68
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,690
But it's not my fault!
It's his!

69
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,590
Ernesto de la Cruz.

70
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,530
The greatest musician
of all time.

71
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,460
Right here
in this very plaza,

72
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,030
Ernesto de la Cruz
took his first steps...

73
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:12,600
toward becoming the most beloved
singer in Mexican history.

74
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,510
He started out a total
nobody from Santa Cecilia, like me.

75
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:21,550
But when he played music, he made
people fall in love with him.

76
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,650
He starred in movies.

77
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,950
He had the coolest guitar!
He could fly!

78
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,520
And he wrote the best songs.

79
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,760
But my all-time favorite,
it's...

80
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,790
♪ Remember me

81
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,060
♪ Remember me

82
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,930

to say goodbye

- ♪ Remember me

84
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,700

85
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,410

86
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,410

87
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,410

89
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,420

in my arms again ♪

92
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,910
He lived the kind
of life you dream about.

93
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,310
Until 1942.

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,250
When he was crushed
by a giant bell.

95
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,720
I want to be just like him.

96
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,880
Sometimes,
I look at de la Cruz

97
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,120
and I get this feeling
like we're connected.

98
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,070
Like if he could play music,
maybe someday, I could too.

99
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,730
If it wasn't for my family.

100
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,130
- Ay-ay-ay, muchacho.
- Huh?

101
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,570
I asked for a shoe shine
not your life story.

102
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,600
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

103
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,870
I just can't really talk about
any of this at home. So...

104
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,870
If I were you,

105
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,040
I'd march right up
to my family and say...

106
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,640
"Hey, I'm a musician.
Deal with it."

107
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,580
I could never say that.

108
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,110
You are a musician, no?

109
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,510
I don't know.

110
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,050
I mean, I only
really play for myself.

111
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,120
Ah! Did de la Cruz become
the world's best musician

112
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,020
by hiding his skills?

113
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,160
No! He walked out
onto that plaza

114
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,160
and he played out loud.

115
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,630
Mira, mira, they're
setting up for tonight!

116
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,030
The music competition
for Dia de Muertos.

117
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,770
You want to be like your hero?
You should sign up!

118
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,670
Uh-uh.
My family would freak!

119
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,360
Look, if you're too scared then,
well, have fun making shoes.

120
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,060
Come on, what did
de la Cruz always say?

121
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,060
Seize your moment?

122
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,180
Show me what
you got, muchacho.

123
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,500
I'll be your first audience.

124
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,240
Miguel!

125
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,070
- Abuelita!
- What are you doing here?

126
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,000
You leave my grandson alone.

127
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,100
Dona, please!

128
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,270
I was just getting
a shine.

129
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,540
I know your tricks, mariachi.
What did he say to you?

130
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,080
He was just
showing me his guitar.

131
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,880
Shame on you.

132
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,180
My grandson is a sweet little
angelito querido cielito.

133
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,920
He wants no part
of your music, mariachi.

134
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,250
You keep away from him.

135
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,690
Ay, pobrecito.
Oh, estas bien, mijo.

136
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,930
You know better than to
be here in this place!

137
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,320
You will come home. Now.

138
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,980
How many times
have we told you?

139
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,350
That plaza is
crawling with mariachis.

140
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,590
Yes, Tio Berto.

141
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,720
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Ah! Go away, you. Go!

142
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,990
It's just Dante.

143
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,120
Never name a street dog.

144
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,180
They'll follow you forever.
Now, go get my shoe.

145
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,040
I found your son
in Mariachi Plaza.

146
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,100
Ay, Miguel!

147
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,740
You know how Abuelita
feels about the plaza.

148
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,040
I was just shining shoes.

149
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,610
A musician's shoes!

150
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,750
But the plaza's where
all the foot traffic is.

151
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,380
If Abuelita says no more
plaza, then no more plaza.

152
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,790
- But what about tonight?
- What's tonight?

153
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,620
Well, they're having
this talent show.

154
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,860
And I
thought I might...

155
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,390
- Sign up?
- Well, maybe?

156
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,760
You have to have
talent to be in a talent show.

157
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,730
What are you gonna do?
Shine shoes?

158
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,200
It's Dia de los Muertos.

159
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,640
No one's going anywhere.
Tonight is about family.

160
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,460
Ofrenda room. Vamonos.

161
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,050
Don't give me that look.

162
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,890
Dia de los Muertos
is the one night of the year

163
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,930
our ancestors
can come visit us.

164
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,160
We've put their photos
on the ofrenda

165
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,060
so their spirits
can cross over.

166
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,030
That is very important.

167
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,930
If we don't put them up,
they can't come.

168
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,670
We made all this food,

169
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,310
set out the things
they loved in life, mijo.

170
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,680
All this work
to bring the family together.

171
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,950
I don't want you sneaking
off to who knows where.

172
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,380
Where are you going?

173
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,920
I thought
we were done.

174
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,050
Ay, Dios mio. Being part
of this family means

175
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,920
being here for this family.

176
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,190
I don't want
to see you end up like...

177
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,360
Like Mama Coco's papa?

178
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,830
Never mention that man!
He's better off forgotten.

179
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,930
But you're the one who...

180
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,100
I was just...

181
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,360
But... I...

182
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,730
Papa? Papa is home?

183
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,700
Mama, calmese, calmese.

184
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,470
Papa is coming home?

185
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,590
No, Mama.
It's okay. I'm here.

186
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,340
Who are you?

187
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,950
Rest, Mama.

188
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:01,120
I'm hard on you
because I care, Miguel.

189
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,300
Miguel? Miguel?

190
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,390
What are we going
to do with that boy?

191
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:13,450
You're right.
That's just what he needs.

192
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,120
It's you. Get in here.

193
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,190
Come on, Dante. Hurry up!

194
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,160
You're gonna
get me in trouble, boy.

195
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,750
Someone could hear me.

196
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,440
I wish someone
wanted to hear me.

197
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,760
Other than you. Ew. Okay.

198
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,490
Perfecto!

199
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,480
I have to sing.
I have to play!

200
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,230
The music, it's not
just in me, it is me.

201
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,140
When life gets me down,
I play my guitar.

202
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,260
The rest of the world
may follow the rules,

203
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,140
but I must follow my heart.

204
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,200
Ugh!

205
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,000
You know that feeling like
there's a song in the air and...

206
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,120
it's playing just for you?

207
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,410
♪ A feeling so close...

208
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,730
♪ You could
reach out and touch it

209
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,250
♪ I never knew

210
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,400
♪ I could want something
so much, but it's true ♪

211
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,960
You must have faith, sister.

212
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,390
Oh, but, Padre,
he will never listen.

213
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,430
He will listen. To music.

214
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,030
♪ Only a song,
only a song

215
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,720
♪ Has the power
to change a heart ♪

216
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,860
Never underestimate
the power of music.

217
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,580
But my father, he will
never give his permission.

218
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,220
I am done
asking permission.

219
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,390
When you see your moment, you
mustn't let it pass you by.

220
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,290
You must seize it!

221
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,520
Senor de la Cruz,

222
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,570
what did it take for you
to seize your moment?

223
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,030
I had to have
faith in my dream.

224
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,000
No one was going
to hand it to me.

225
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,300
It was up to me
to reach for that dream.

226
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,270
Grab it tight
and make it come true.

227
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,890
...and make it come true.

228
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:16,050
No more hiding, Dante.
I got to seize my moment!

229
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,220
I'm gonna play in Mariachi
Plaza if it kills me.

230
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:27,290
Dia de los Muertos has begun!

231
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:30,560
No, no. We have to make
a clear path.

232
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,200
The petals guide
our ancestors home.

233
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,230
We don't want
their spirits to get lost.

234
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,940
We want them to come
and enjoy all the food

235
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,550
and drinks on the ofrenda.

236
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,000
Mama!

237
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,370
Where should we
put this table?

238
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,080
In the courtyard, mijos.

239
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,240
You want it
down by the kitchen?

240
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,650
Si. Next to the other one.

241
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,190
- Get under! Get under!
- Miguel?

242
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,620
Nothing! Mama, Papa. I...

243
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:02,490
Miguel, your abuelita had
the most wonderful idea.

244
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:06,730
We've all decided. It's time
you joined us in the workshop!

245
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,200
- What?
- No more shining shoes.

246
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,140
You'll be making them
every day after school.

247
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,210
Oh! Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to

248
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,670
carrying on
the family tradition.

249
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,340
And on Dia de los Muertos!

250
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,150
Your ancestors
will be so proud.

251
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,550
You'll craft huaraches
just like your Tia Victoria.

252
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,220
And wingtips
like your Papa Julio.

253
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,760
But what if
I'm no good at making shoes?

254
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,130
Ah, Miguel. You have your
family here to guide you.

255
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:40,710
You are a Rivera.
And a Rivera is...

256
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,270
A shoemaker.
Through and through.

257
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,310
That's my boy!
Berto!

258
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,270
Break out the good stuff.
I want to make a toast.

259
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,900
Dante! No, Dante. Stop!

260
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:17,480
No, no, no, no, no! No.

261
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,610
De la Cruz's guitar?

262
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,070
Papa? Papa?

263
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,190
Mama Coco, is your papa
Ernesto de la Cruz?

264
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,830
Papa! Papa!

265
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,570
Papa! Papa! It's him!

266
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,440
I know who my
great-great-grandfather was.

267
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,480
Miguel, get down
from there.

268
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,250
Mama Coco's father
was Ernesto de la Cruz!

269
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,550
What are you talking about?

270
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,630
I'm gonna be a musician!

271
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,650
What is all this?

272
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,760
You keep secrets
from your own family?

273
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,090
It's all that time
he spends in the plaza.

274
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,490
Fills his head
with crazy fantasies.

275
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,090
It's not a fantasy.

276
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,360
That man was
Ernesto de la Cruz!

277
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,230
The greatest musician
of all time!

278
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,770
We've never known anything
about this man!

279
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,500
But whoever he was, he still
abandoned his family.

280
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,140
This is no future
for my son.

281
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,680
But, Papa, you said
my family would guide me.

282
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,240
Well, de la Cruz
is my family.

283
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,780
I'm supposed to play music.

284
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,110
Never! That man's music
was a curse.

285
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,120
I will not allow it.

286
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,650
- If you would just let...
- Miguel...

287
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,250
You will listen
to your family.

288
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,550
No more music.

289
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:46,700
- Just listen to me play!
- End of argument.

290
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,190
You want to end up
like that man? Forgotten?

291
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,600
Left off
your family's ofrenda?

292
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,730
I don't care if I'm on
some stupid ofrenda.

293
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,740
- No!
- Mama!

294
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:09,280
There. No guitar.
No music.

295
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:16,490
Oh, come. You'll feel better
after you eat with your family.

296
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,600
I don't want
to be in this family!

297
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,070
Miguel! Miguel!

298
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,380
I want to play in the plaza,
like de la Cruz.

299
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,580
Can I still sign up?

300
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,250
You got an instrument?

301
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,580
No. But if I
can borrow a guitar...

302
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,450
Musicians got to bring
their own instruments.

303
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,920
You find a guitar, kid,

304
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,640
I'll put you on the list.

305
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,330
- Can I borrow your guitar?
- Sorry, muchacho.

306
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:01,330
- You guys have a spare guitar?
- No.

307
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,470
I need a guitar
just for a little bit.

308
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,050
Get out of here, kid.

309
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,230
Great-great-grandfather,
what am I supposed to do?

310
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,420
No, no, no, no.

311
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,290
Dante, stop! Callate! Shh!

312
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,270
I'm sorry.

313
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,360
Senor de la Cruz,
please don't be mad.

314
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,720
I'm Miguel.

315
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:13,310
Your great-great grandson.
I need to borrow this.

316
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,870
Our family thinks
music is a curse.

317
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:22,770
None of them understand
but I know you would have.

318
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,540
You would have told me
to follow my heart.

319
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,060
To seize my moment!

320
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,350
So, if it's
all right with you,

321
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,070
I'm gonna play in the plaza.
Just like you did!

322
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,760
The guitar! It's gone!

323
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,060
Somebody stole
de la Cruz's guitar!

324
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,370
The window's broken.
Look!

325
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,540
All right, who's in there?

326
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,380
I'm sorry.
It's not what it looks like.

327
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,890
De la Cruz is my...

328
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,260
There's nobody here.

329
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,060
- Miguel!
- Mama!

330
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:23,700
Miguel, come home.
Where are you, Miguel?

331
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,540
Dios mio!
Little boy. Are you okay?

332
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,260
Here. Let me help you.

333
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,930
Thanks. I...

334
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,440
Do you mind? Whoa!

335
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,710
Look how big she's getting.

336
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,750
Dante!

337
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,750
You can see me? Wait!

338
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,810
What's going on? Dante!

339
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,990
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Miguel?

340
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,780
- Miguel?
- Miguel?

341
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:34,870
You're here? Here, here.
And you can see us?

342
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,510
Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to!

343
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,010
Remind me how I know you.

344
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,990
We're your family, mijo.

345
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,800
- Tia Rosita?
- Si.

346
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,970
- Papa Julio?
- Hola.

347
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,160
Tia Victoria?

348
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,660
He doesn't
seem entirely dead.

349
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,560
He's not quite alive either.

350
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,160
We need Mama Imelda.
She'll know how to fix this.

351
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:04,170
Oye! It's Mama Imelda.

352
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,570
She couldn't cross over.

353
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:08,000
- She's stuck!
- On the other side!

354
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,810
Tio Oscar? Tio Felipe?

355
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,910
Oh. Hey, Miguel.

356
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,540
I have a feeling this has
something to do with you.

357
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,680
But if Mama Imelda
can't come to us...

358
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,950
Then we are going to her.
Vamonos!

359
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,230
Whoa.

360
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,980
Come on, Miguel.
It's okay.

361
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:55,170
Dante? Dante!
Dante, wait up!

362
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:02,440
You got to stay with me, boy.
We don't know... where...

363
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:26,280
This isn't a dream then.
You're all really out there.

364
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,250
- You thought we weren't?
- Well, I don't know.

365
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,120
I thought it might've been
one of those

366
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,050
made up things
that adults tell kids.

367
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,620
Like vitamins.

368
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,760
Miguel,
vitamins are a real thing.

369
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,930
Well, now I'm thinking
maybe they could be.

370
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,000
Mija, it's not nice to stare at...

371
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,670
Ay! Santa Maria!

372
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,740
Are those...
Alebrijes! But those are...

373
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,280
Real alebrijes.
Spirit creatures.

374
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,150
They guide souls
on their journey.

375
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,620
Watch your step. They
make caquitas everywhere.

376
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,820
Welcome back
to the Land of the Dead.

377
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,660
Please have all offerings
ready for re-entry.

378
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,890
Welcome back.
Anything to declare?

379
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,360
Some churros.
From my family.

380
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,360
How wonderful. Next.

381
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,230
If you are
experiencing travel issues,

382
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,970
agents at
the Department of Family...

383
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,200
Reunions are
available to assist you.

384
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,980
Next family, please.

385
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:25,040
Oh! Your photos
are on your son's ofrenda.

386
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,410
Have a great visit.

387
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,680
Gracias.

388
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,710
And remember
to return before sunrise.

389
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,910
Enjoy your visit.

390
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,250
Next.

391
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:36,790
Your photo's on your dentist's ofrenda.
Enjoy your visit.

392
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,570
- Gracias.
- Next?

393
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,090
Yes! It is I.
Frida Kahlo.

394
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,660
Shall we skip
the scanner?

395
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:48,380
I'm on so many ofrendas it'll just
overwhelm your blinky thingy.

396
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:54,670
Well, shoot, looks like no one
put up your photo, Frida.

397
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:58,940
Okay, when I said I was Frida,
just now, that was a lie.

398
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,340
And I apologize
for doing that.

399
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,210
No photo on an ofrenda,
no crossing the bridge.

400
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:07,000
I'm just gonna zip right over.
You won't even know I'm gone.

401
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,130
Hey!

402
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:19,430
Almost... there.
Just a little further.

403
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,300
Upsy-daisy...

404
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:29,710
Fine. Okay. Fine, who cares?
Dumb flower bridge!

405
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:33,810
Aw. I don't know what I'd do
if no one put up my photo.

406
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:36,110
- Next?
- Oh! Come, mijo. It's our turn.

407
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:39,050
Welcome back, amigos.
Anything to declare?

408
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:42,470
As a matter of fact, yes.

409
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,170
Hola.

410
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,160
Paging Marta Gonzales-Ramos.

411
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,050
Please report to Level Seven.

412
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,090
Whoa!

413
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,330
I miss my nose.

414
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,320
Come on, help us out, amigo.

415
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,790
We got to get to
a dozen ofrendas tonight.

416
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:23,930
We are not visiting your ex-wife's
family for Dia de Muertos!

417
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:26,460
I demand to speak
to the person in charge!

418
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:29,370
I'm sorry, senora, it says
here no one put up your photo.

419
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:33,940
My family always puts my
photo on the ofrenda.

420
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:37,040
That devil box tells
you nothing but lies!

421
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,810
- Mama Imelda?
- Oh, mi familia!

422
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,410
They wouldn't let me
cross the bridge.

423
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:45,920
Tell this woman
and her devil box

424
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,450
that my photo
is on the ofrenda.

425
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,920
Well, we never
made it to the ofrenda.

426
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,640
- What?
- We ran into...

427
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:01,450
- Miguel?
- Mama Imelda.

428
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,200
What is going on?

429
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,500
You the Rivera family?

430
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,470
Well, you're cursed.

431
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,610
What?

432
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:13,240
Dia de los Muertos is the
night to give to the dead.

433
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,840
You stole from the dead!

434
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,210
But I wasn't
stealing the guitar.

435
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,350
Guitar?

436
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,950
It was my
great-great-grandfather's.

437
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,250
He would have
wanted me to have it.

438
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,390
Ah, ah, ah. We do not speak
of that musician.

439
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,120
He is dead to this family.

440
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,090
Uh,
you're all dead.

441
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,830
I am sorry.
Whose alebrije is that?

442
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,090
That's just Dante.

443
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,230
He sure doesn't
look like an alebrije.

444
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,830
He just looks
like a plain old dog.

445
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,100
Or a sausage someone dropped
in a barbershop.

446
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,870
Whatever he is, I am
terribly allergic.

447
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:43,540
But Dante
doesn't have any hair.

448
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:46,240
And I don't have a nose,
and yet, here we are.

449
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:51,150
But none of this explains
why I couldn't cross over.

450
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,830
Oh!

451
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:57,020
You took my photo
off the ofrenda?

452
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,120
- It was an accident!
- How do we send him back?

453
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,860
Well,
since it's a family matter...

454
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,290
the way to undo
a family curse

455
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,030
- is to get your family's blessing.
- That's it?

456
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,430
Get your family's blessing

457
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:11,030
and everything should
go back to normal.

458
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,070
But you got
to do it by sunrise.

459
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,000
What happens at sunrise?

460
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,860
Hijole! Your hand!

461
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,880
Whoa, Miguel, can't have
you fainting on us.

462
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,450
But not to worry.
Your family's here.

463
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,490
You can get
your blessing right now.

464
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:34,460
Cempasuchil, cempasuchil.
Aha! Perdon, senora.

465
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,430
Oh.

466
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:38,340
Now, you look at the living
and say his name.

467
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,260
Miguel.

468
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,570
Nailed it. Now say,
"I give you my blessing."

469
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,620
I give you my blessing.

470
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,440
I give you my blessing
to go home...

471
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,610
to put my photo
back on the ofrenda,

472
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:57,050
and to never
play music again.

473
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,920
What? She can't do that!

474
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,180
Well, technically, she can
add any condition she wants.

475
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,320
Fine.

476
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,540
Then you hand
the petal to Miguel.

477
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,420
No skeletons!

478
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,790
Mariachi Plaza,
here I come.

479
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,210
Two seconds and you already
break your promise.

480
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:37,090
This isn't fair. It's my life.
You already had yours.

481
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:39,160
Papa Julio,
I ask for your blessing.

482
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,260
Tia Rosita? Oscar?

483
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,130
Felipe? Tia Victoria?

484
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:49,530
Don't make this hard, mijo.
You go home my way or no way.

485
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,400
You really hate
music that much?

486
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,550
I will not let you go down
the same path he did.

487
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:01,180
The same path he did.
He's family.

488
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,980
Listen to your Mama Imelda.

489
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,250
She's just
looking out for you.

490
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,310
Be reasonable.

491
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,650
Con permiso,
I need to visit the restroom.

492
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,440
Be right back.

493
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,390
Uh, should we tell him
there are no restrooms

494
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,710
in the Land of the Dead?

495
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,910
Vamonos.

496
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:31,610
We got a family
looking for a living boy.

497
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:34,340
If I want to be a musician,
I need a musician's blessing.

498
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,410
We got to find
my great-great-grandpa.

499
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,460
Hold it, muchacho.

500
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,420
I found that living boy!

501
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,650
Oh, whoa, excuse me.
Excuse me, folks.

502
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,010
Excuse me.

503
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,270
Oh.

504
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,300
No, no. Dante!

505
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,330
Disturbing the peace.
Fleeing an officer.

506
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,200
Falsifying a unibrow.

507
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,470
- That's illegal?
- Very illegal.

508
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:04,570
You need to clean up
your act, amigo.

509
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:08,310
Amigo? Oh, that's so nice
to hear you say that

510
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,110
because I have just had a...

511
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:13,050
really hard Dia de Muertos
and I could really use

512
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,050
an amigo right now.

513
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,790
And amigos,
they help their amigos.

514
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:19,490
You get me across
that bridge tonight,

515
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,090
and I'll make it
worth your while.

516
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:24,190
Oh! You like de la Cruz?
He and I go way back.

517
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,530
I can get you front row seats to
his Sunrise Spectacular show.

518
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,730
I'll get you backstage.
You can meet him.

519
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,470
You just got to let me
cross that bridge!

520
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,640
I should lock you up
for the rest of the holiday.

521
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,740
But my shift's almost up and I
want to visit my living family.

522
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,460
So I'm letting you off
with a warning.

523
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:43,550
Can I at least
get my costume back?

524
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,350
Uh... No.

525
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,830
Some amigo.

526
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:53,760
Hey! Hey!
You really know de la Cruz?

527
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,390
Who wants to... Ahh!
Ay! You're alive!

528
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,090
Shh! Yeah, I'm alive.

529
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,160
And if I want to get back
to the Land of the Living...

530
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,630
I need de la Cruz's blessing.

531
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,230
That's weirdly specific.

532
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,770
He's my
great-great-grandfather.

533
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:07,350
He's your Gr... What?

534
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,700
Ugh.

535
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:13,560
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

536
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:16,510
Wait. No, wait, wait, wait.

537
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:20,650
Wait! Yes! You're going back
to the Land of the Living!

538
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,650
You know what? Maybe this
isn't such a good...

539
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:25,390
No, no, nino! Nino, nino, I can help you.
You can help me.

540
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:26,520
We can help each other.

541
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,390
But most importantly,
you can help me.

542
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:29,890
- Miguel!
- I'm Hector.

543
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:31,440
That's nice.

544
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,780
Esperame, chamaco!

545
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:48,180
Ay, he is going
to get himself killed.

546
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:51,800
I need my spirit guide...
Pepita.

547
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:05,560
Who has that petal
Miguel touched?

548
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,680
Here. Nice alebrije.

549
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:26,030
Ay, ay, hold still. Look up. A ver, a ver.
Look up, up, up.

550
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:32,450
Aqui arriba, eso...
Eh, la rayita.

551
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,040
Okay. Hey! Ta-da!

552
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:37,580
Dead as a doorknob.

553
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:41,630
So listen, Miguel,
this place runs on memories.

554
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,870
When you're well remembered,

555
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,730
people put up your photo
and you get to...

556
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,340
cross the bridge
and visit the living

557
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,800
on Dia de Muertos.
Unless you're me.

558
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,610
You don't get
to cross over?

559
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:51,870
No one's ever
put up my picture.

560
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,660
But you can change that!

561
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,640
This is you?

562
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,280
Eh, muy guapo, eh?

563
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,380
So, you get me
to my great-great-grandpa...

564
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:03,280
then I put up your photo
when I get home?

565
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:06,960
Such a smart boy! Yes!
Great idea, yes! One hiccup.

566
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,890
De la Cruz is
a tough guy to get to

567
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,690
and I need to
cross the bridge soon.

568
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,700
Like, tonight.

569
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,660
So, you got any other
family here, you know?

570
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,800
Someone a bit more,
eh, accessible?

571
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,630
Mmm... Nope.

572
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,970
Don't yank my chain,
chamaco.

573
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,570
You got to have
some other family.

574
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:21,910
Only de la Cruz.

575
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,940
If you can't help me,
I'll find him myself.

576
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,810
Oh! Okay. Okay, kid.
Fine! Fine!

577
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,690
I'll get you to your
great-great-grandpa.

578
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,850
It's not gonna
be easy, you know?

579
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:35,990
He's a busy man.
What are you doing?

580
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:38,650
I'm walking like a skeleton.
Blending in.

581
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,460
No. Skeletons
don't walk like that.

582
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:44,530
- It's how you walk.
- No, I don't! Stop it!

583
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:48,470
Whoa! Ernesto de la Cruz's
Sunrise Spectacular?

584
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,270
Que padre!

585
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:53,400
Every year your great-great-grandpa
puts on that dumb show...

586
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,840
to mark the end
of Dia de Muertos.

587
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,410
- And you can get us in!
- Um...

588
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,680
Hey, you said you have
front row tickets!

589
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,880
That... was a lie.
I apologize for that.

590
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,050
Cool off, chamaco.
Come on. I'll get you to him.

591
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,150
How?

592
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,270
Because I happen to know
where he's rehearsing.

593
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:23,010
♪ Remember me
Don't let it make you cry ♪

594
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,570
You better have
my dress, Hector.

595
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:27,950
Hola, Ceci.

596
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:38,050
- Hola.
- Ceci, I lost the dress.

597
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,720
Ya lo sabia!

598
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,980
I got to dress
forty dancers by sunrise.

599
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:45,850
Thanks to you, I'm one Frida
short of an opening number!

600
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:49,940
Dante!
We shouldn't be in here.

601
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,190
No, no, Dante! Ven aca!

602
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,890
You! How did you
get in here?

603
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:22,060
- I just followed my...
- Oh! The mighty Xolo dog!

604
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:25,030
Guider of wandering spirits.

605
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:28,060
And whose spirit
have you guided to me?

606
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,430
I don't think
he's a spirit guide.

607
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,430
Ah, ah, ah.

608
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,500
The alebrijes of this world
can take many forms.

609
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:37,820
They are as mysterious
as they are powerful.

610
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:47,260
Or maybe he's just a dog.
Come, I need your eyes.

611
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,690
You are the audience.
Darkness.

612
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:56,910
And from the darkness,
a giant papaya.

613
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,860
Dancers emerge
from the papaya,

614
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:04,930
and the dancers are all me.

615
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,670
And they go to drink from
the milk of their mother,

616
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,870
who is a cactus.

617
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,610
But who is also me.

618
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:14,930
And her milk is
not milk but tears.

619
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,950
Is it too obvious?

620
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:20,680
I think it's just
the right amount of obvious?

621
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,090
It could use some music.
Oh, what if you did like...

622
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,960
Oh! And then it could go...

623
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:37,430
And what if
everything was on fire?

624
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,640
Yes! Fire! Everywhere!

625
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,840
Inspired! You have
the spirit of an artist.

626
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,710
The dancers exit. The music
fades, the lights go out.

627
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:52,050
And Ernesto de la Cruz
rises to the stage!

628
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,150
Huh?

629
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,490
He does a couple of songs, the
sun rises, everyone cheers...

630
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:02,020
Excuse me,
where's the real de la Cruz?

631
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:04,130
Ernesto doesn't do
rehearsals!

632
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:08,040
He's too busy hosting that fancy
party at the top of his tower.

633
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,670
Chamaco, you can't run off
on me like that.

634
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,500
Stop pestering
the celebrities.

635
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,670
You said my great-great-grandpa
would be here!

636
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,540
He's halfway across town
throwing some big party.

637
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,950
That bum. Who doesn't show up
to his own rehearsal?

638
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:25,880
If you're such good friends,
how come he didn't invite you?

639
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,750
He's your great-great-grandpa,
how come he didn't invite you?

640
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:31,750
Hey, Gustavo! You know
anything about this party?

641
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,190
It's the hot ticket!

642
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,790
But if you're not
on the guest list,

643
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:37,230
you're never
getting in, Chorizo.

644
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:40,030
Hey! It's Chorizo! Choricito!

645
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,660
A-ha. Very funny, guys.
Very funny.

646
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,900
Chorizo?

647
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,030
Oh, this guy's famous!

648
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,170
Go on, go on.
Ask him how he died.

649
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,800
I don't want
to talk about it.

650
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:51,940
He choked on some chorizo!

651
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,780
I didn't choke, okay?

652
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,780
I got food poisoning
which is a big difference.

653
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,550
This is why
I don't like musicians.

654
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,180
Bunch of
self-important jerks.

655
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,690
- Hey! I'm a musician!
- You are?

656
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:07,520
If you really want
to get to Ernesto,

657
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,920
there is that
music competition...

658
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:10,590
at the Plaza de la Cruz.

659
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,140
Winner gets
to play at his party.

660
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:17,100
No, no. Chamaco,
you're loco if you think...

661
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,540
I need to get my
great-great-grandfather's blessing!

662
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,420
You know where
I can get a guitar?

663
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:25,290
I know a guy.

664
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,950
Have you found him, Pepita?
Have you found our boy?

665
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,960
- A footprint!
- It's a Rivera boot.

666
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,830
- Size seven!
- And a half.

667
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:48,280
- Pronated.
- Miguel.

668
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,710
Why the heck would
you want to be a musician?

669
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,580
My great-great-grandpa
was a musician!

670
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,110
Who spent his life
performing like a monkey

671
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,910
for complete strangers.

672
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,320
No thank you.
No! Guacala!

673
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,180
What do you know?

674
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,590
So, how far is
this guitar anyway?

675
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:12,970
We're almost there.

676
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,380
Keep up, chamaco. Come on.

677
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,740
- Cousin Hector!
- Hey! These guys! Hey, Tio!

678
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,880
¿Que onda?

679
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,340
These people are
all your family?

680
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,710
Uh...

681
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:40,050
In a way. We're all the ones
with no photos or ofrendas.

682
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:43,190
No family to go home to.
Nearly forgotten, you know?

683
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:47,340
So, we all call each other
cousin, or tio, or whatever.

684
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,280
- Hector!
- Tia Chelo!

685
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:58,170
Muchas gracias!

686
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:00,700
Hey! Save some for me!
Is Chicharron around?

687
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,870
Eh, in the bungalow.

688
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,370
I don't know if he's in
the mood for visitors.

689
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,660
Who doesn't like
a visit from Cousin Hector?

690
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,690
Buenas noches, Chicharron!

691
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:21,120
I don't want to see
your stupid face, Hector.

692
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:23,190
Come on.
It's Dia de Muertos.

693
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:24,790
I brought you
a little offering.

694
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,860
- Get out of here.
- I would, Cheech.

695
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:29,510
But the thing is,
me and my friend, Miguel...

696
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,370
We really need
to borrow your guitar.

697
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:33,940
- My guitar?
- Yes.

698
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:36,240
My prized beloved guitar?

699
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,070
I promise
we'll bring it right back.

700
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:40,740
Like the time you promised
to bring back my van?

701
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,210
- Uh...
- Or my mini-fridge?

702
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:43,950
- Ah, you see...
- Or my good napkins?

703
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:45,780
My lasso? My femur?

704
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,010
Well, no,
not like those times.

705
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,350
Where is my femur?
You...

706
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:51,350
Whoa, whoa.

707
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:55,270
- You okay, amigo?
- I'm fading, Hector.

708
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,290
I can feel it.

709
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,480
I couldn't even play
that thing if I wanted to.

710
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,240
You play me something.

711
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,300
No. You know
I don't play anymore, Cheech.

712
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:11,240
The guitar is for the kid.

713
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:15,030
You want it,
you got to earn it.

714
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:19,300
Ay, only for you, amigo.

715
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:23,250
Any requests?

716
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:27,340
You know my favorite, Hector.

717
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:48,530

00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:46,250
Gracias.

729
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:19,500
Wait. What happened?

730
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,540
He's been forgotten.

731
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,100
When there's no one left
in the living world

732
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:24,440
who remembers you...

733
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,240
you disappear
from this world.

734
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,180
We call it
the final death.

735
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,380
Where did he go?

736
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,650
No one knows.

737
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:37,850
But I've met him. I could
remember him when I go back!

738
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,190
No, it doesn't work
like that, chamaco.

739
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:43,160
Our memories,
they have to be passed down

740
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,990
by those
who knew us in life...

741
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,860
in the stories
they tell about us.

742
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:51,720
But there's no one left alive
to pass down Cheech's stories.

743
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,200
Hey, it happens
to everyone eventually.

744
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:59,190
Come on, de la Cruzcito,
you've got a contest to win.

745
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:13,290
You told me
you hated musicians.

746
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:14,590
You never said you were one.

747
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:17,060
How do you think I
knew your great-great-grandpa?

748
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,290
We used to play
music together.

749
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,260
Taught him
everything he knows.

750
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:23,530
No manches! You played
with Ernesto de la Cruz...

751
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:25,430
the greatest musician
of all time?

752
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,200
Ah, you're funny.

753
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,170
Greatest eyebrows
of all time maybe.

754
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:31,170
But his music?
Eh, not so much.

755
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:33,360
You don't know
what you're talking about.

756
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:38,280
Welcome
to the Plaza de la Cruz!

757
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,530
Showtime, chamaco!

758
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,940
Llevelo!
T-shirts! Bobbleheads!

759
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,940
Bienvenidos a todos!

760
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,940
Oh!

761
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:06,470
Who's ready for some musica?

762
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,110
It's a battle
of the bands, amigos.

763
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:12,180
The winner gets to play
for the maestro himself,

764
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,220
Ernesto de la Cruz...

765
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:17,050
at his fiesta tonight!

766
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:18,590
That's our ticket, muchacho.

767
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:20,720
Oh! Oh, oh, oh!

768
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,630
Let the competition begin!

769
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,210
So, what's the plan?
What are you gonna play?

770
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,610
Definitely Remember Me.

771
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:45,010
No! Not that one. No.

772
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,080
Come on.
It's his most popular song!

773
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,380
Ah, it's too popular.

774
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:50,490
♪ Remember me
Though I have to travel far ♪

775
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:51,650
♪ Remember me... ♪

776
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:53,650
♪ Don't let it
make you cry... ♪

777
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:01,660
- What about Poco Loco?
- Epa! Now that's a song!

778
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:03,570
De la Cruzcito?
You're on standby.

779
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:05,580
Los Chachalacos,
you're up next.

780
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:08,670
Los Chachalacos!

781
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,780
You always this nervous
before a performance?

782
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:25,120
I don't know.
I've never performed before.

783
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,060
What? You said
you were a musician!

784
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,020
I am!
I mean, I will be.

785
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:30,430
- Ay!
- Once I win.

786
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:33,030
That's your plan?
No. You have to win.

787
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:34,600
Your life
literally depends on...

788
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,160
you winning. And you've
never done this before!

789
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:37,330
I'll go up there.

790
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:39,670
- No! I need to do this.
- Why?

791
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:42,140
If I can't go out
and play one song,

792
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,040
how can I call
myself a musician?

793
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,410
What does that matter?

794
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:47,310
Because I don't just want to
get de la Cruz's blessing...

795
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:51,810
I need to prove
that I'm worthy of it.

796
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:54,720
Oh, that's such
a sweet sentiment

797
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,190
at such a bad time!

798
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:01,760
Okay! Okay.
You want to perform?

799
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,560
Then you got to perform!

800
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:06,560
First, you have to loosen up.
Shake off those nerves.

801
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,300
Now give me
your best grito.

802
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,050
- My best grito?
- Come on, yell! Belt it out.

803
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:21,660
Ah, it feels good.
Okay, now you.

804
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:28,670
Oh, come on, kid.

Hey, look at me.

You can do this.

808

Grab their attention
and don't let it go.

Earlier tonight
he ran away from his family.

844
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:39,810
They just want to send him back
to the Land of the Living.

I do have other family,
but...

849

You could have taken my
photo back this whole time?

850
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:51,390
But they hate music!
I need a musician's blessing.

I'm not gonna
miss my one chance

00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:00,130
to cross that
bridge because...

856
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:03,330
you want to live out

You don't want to help me.
You only care about yourself!

You're not a spirit guide.
You're just a dumb dog!

870
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,840

Oh, I loved it!
I remember that feeling...

888

when my husband would play,

889

01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:08,020
I'm Miguel.
Your great-great-grandson.

947
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:11,490
I... have
a great-great-grandson?

948
01:01:11,490 --> 01:01:13,390
I need your blessing

949
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,730
so I can go back home
and be a musician.

950
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:17,400
Just like you.

951
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:21,240
The rest of our family,
they wouldn't listen.

952
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:24,290
But I hoped you would.

953
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:30,730
My boy, with a talent like
yours, how could I not listen?

954
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,880
Aww!

955
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,280
I have a great-great-grandson!

956
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:46,290
- Look! It's Frida!
- Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo.

957
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:49,310
- It is an honor, Senora.
- Gracias.

958
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:55,300
Hey, Negrete! Infante!

959
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:57,540
Have you met
my great-great-grandson?

960
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:59,440
My great-great-grandson.

961
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:02,010
He's alive!
And a musician to boot!

962
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:04,040
Dimple. No dimple.
Dimple. No dimple.

963
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:05,150
No dimple!

964
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:06,580
To our friendship.

965
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:10,470
I would move Heaven and
Earth for you, mi amigo. Salud!

966
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:13,450
Poison!

967
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:15,790
You know,
I did all my own stunts.

968
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:19,640
♪ Though I have to say
goodbye Remember me... ♪

969
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:24,030
All of this
came from my amazing fans

970
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:26,430
in the Land of the Living.

971
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:30,470
They leave me more offerings
than I know what to do with!

972
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:34,070
Hey, what's wrong? Is it too much?
You look overwhelmed.

973
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:37,350
- No! It's all great!
- But?

974
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:39,450
It's just...

975
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:41,850
I have been looking up to you
my whole life.

976
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:45,230
You're the guy
who actually did it!

977
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:49,120
But did you ever regret it?

978
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:52,540
Choosing music
over everything else?

979
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,490
It was hard.

980
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:58,550
Saying goodbye to my hometown.
Heading off on my own...

981
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,500
Leaving your family?

982
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:06,410
Si. But I could not have
done it differently.

983
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:10,010
One cannot deny
who one is meant to be.

984
01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:14,430
And you, my great-great-grandson,
are meant to be a musician!

985
01:03:16,850 --> 01:03:19,350
You and I,
we are artists, Miguel.

986
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,360
We cannot
belong to one family.

987
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,840
The world is our family.

988
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:28,280
Ooh! Ooh!
The fireworks have begun!

989
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:43,010
Soon the party will move across
town for my Sunrise Spectacular.

990
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:45,980
Miguel,
you must come to the show!

991
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:48,010
You will be
my guest of honor!

992
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:50,430
- You mean it?
- Of course, my boy.

993
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,290
I can't.

994
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:56,990
I have to get home
before sunrise.

995
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:59,310
Oh! I really do
need to get you home.

996
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:06,170
It has been an honor.

997
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:08,570
I am sorry
to see you go, Miguel.

998
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:10,450
I hope you die very soon.

999
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:14,660
You know what I mean.

1000
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:19,480
Miguel, I give you my bless...

1001
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,550
We had a deal, chamaco.

1002
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:25,190
Who are you?
What is the meaning of this?

1003
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:28,020
Oh, Frida! I thought
you couldn't make it.

1004
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:30,190
You said
you'd take back my photo.

1005
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:31,590
You promised, Miguel.

1006
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:33,630
You know this, uh, man?

1007
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:37,380
Uh, I just met him tonight.
He told me he knew you.

1008
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,630
Hector?

1009
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:42,920
Please, Miguel.
Put my photo up.

1010
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:49,080
My friend,
you're being forgotten.

1011
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,710
- And whose fault is that?
- Hector, please...

1012
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:53,510
Those were my songs you took.
My songs that made you famous.

1013
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,580
What?

1014
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:56,220
If I'm being forgotten,
it's because you never

1015
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:58,090
told anyone
that I wrote them!

1016
01:04:58,090 --> 01:05:01,320
That's crazy! De la Cruz
wrote all his own songs.

1017
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,220
You want to tell him
or should I?

1018
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:05,630
Hector, I never meant
to take credit.

1019
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:09,200
We made a great team,
but you died...

1020
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,230
and I only sang your songs

1021
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:14,230
because I wanted to keep
a part of you alive.

1022
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,970
Oh, how generous!

1023
01:05:15,970 --> 01:05:18,210
You really did
play together.

1024
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:20,540
I don't want
to fight about it.

1025
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:22,380
I just want you
to make it right.

1026
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:26,430
Miguel can put my photo up, and
I can cross over the bridge.

1027
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:29,150
I can see my girl.

1028
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:32,120
Ernesto,
remember the night I left?

1029
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:33,650
That was a long time ago.

1030
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:35,290
We drank together
and you told me

1031
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:37,260
you would move
Heaven and Earth...

1032
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:41,230
for your amigo.
Well, I'm asking you to now.

1033
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:43,530
Heaven and Earth?
Like in the movie?

1034
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:46,270
- What?
- That's Don Hidalgo's toast.

1035
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:48,770
In the de la Cruz movie,
El Camino a Casa.

1036
01:05:48,770 --> 01:05:50,170
I'm talking about
my real life, Miguel.

1037
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:53,010
No! It's in there. Look!

1038
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:54,380
Never were
truer words spoken.

1039
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:57,540
This calls for a toast.
To our friendship!

1040
01:05:57,550 --> 01:06:00,250
I would move Heaven and Earth
for you, mi amigo.

1041
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:03,380
But in the movie, Don
Hidalgo poisons the drink.

1042
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:06,340
- Salud!
- Poison!

1043
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:12,790
That night, Ernesto.
The night I left...

1044
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,400
We'd been performing
on the road for months.

1045
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:16,700
I got homesick...

1046
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:18,480
and I packed up my songs.

1047
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:20,070
You want to give up now

1048
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:22,540
when we're this close
to reaching our dream?

1049
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:24,570
This was your dream.
You'll manage.

1050
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:26,570
I can't do this
without your songs, Hector.

1051
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:27,740
I'm going home, Ernesto.

1052
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:30,490
Hate me if you want,
but my mind is made up.

1053
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:36,820
Oh, I could never hate you.
If you must go,

1054
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:39,930
then I'm sending you off
with a toast.

1055
01:06:43,490 --> 01:06:44,760
To our friendship.

1056
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:49,380
I would move Heaven and Earth
for you, mi amigo. Salud!

1057
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:55,470
You walked me
to the train station.

1058
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:58,340
But I felt
a pain in my stomach.

1059
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:00,610
I thought it must have been
something I ate.

1060
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:03,110
Perhaps it was
that chorizo, my friend.

1061
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:05,660
Or something I drank.

1062
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:10,930
I woke up dead.

1063
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,790
You poisoned me.

1064
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:18,330
You're confusing movies
with reality, Hector.

1065
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:21,980
All this time, I thought
it was just bad luck.

1066
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:27,080
I never thought that
you might have... That you...

1067
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:32,740
- How could you?
- Hector!

1068
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:34,090
Security! Security!

1069
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:38,830
You took everything
away from me! You rat!

1070
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:43,350
Have him taken care of.
He's not well.

1071
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:48,140
I just wanted to go back home.
No! No!

1072
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:52,630
I apologize.
Where were we?

1073
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:54,830
You were going to give me
your blessing.

1074
01:07:54,830 --> 01:07:57,480
Yes. Uh, si.

1075
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:04,240
Miguel, uh,
my reputation...

1076
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:07,710
It is
very important to me.

1077
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:09,810
I would hate
to have you think...

1078
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:13,850
That you murdered Hector
for his songs?

1079
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:18,580
You don't think that.
Do you?

1080
01:08:18,590 --> 01:08:23,570
I... No. Everyone
knows you're the good guy.

1081
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:32,880
Papa Ernesto, my blessing?

1082
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:39,610
Security? Take care of Miguel.
He'll be extending his stay.

1083
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:42,740
What? But I'm your family!

1084
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:45,310
And Hector
was my best friend.

1085
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:48,710
Success doesn't
come for free, Miguel.

1086
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,880
You have to be willing to do
whatever it takes

1087
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:54,350
to seize your moment.

1088
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:55,940
I know you understand.

1089
01:08:56,330 --> 01:08:58,870
No! No!

1090
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,500
Let go! No!

1091
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:30,260
Help!
Can anyone hear me?

1092
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:32,710
I want to go home.

1093
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:52,910
- Hector?
- Kid?

1094
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,780
Oh, Hector!
You were right.

1095
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:58,390
I should have gone
back to my family.

1096
01:09:58,390 --> 01:10:00,950
They told me not
to be like de la Cruz,

1097
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,790
but I didn't listen.

1098
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:05,790
I told them I didn't care
if they remembered me.

1099
01:10:05,790 --> 01:10:09,360
I didn't care if I was
on their stupid ofrenda.

1100
01:10:09,370 --> 01:10:12,270
Hey, chamaco.
It's okay. It's okay.

1101
01:10:12,270 --> 01:10:14,890
I told them I didn't care.

1102
01:10:18,570 --> 01:10:21,760
Hector! Hector?

1103
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:25,680
She's forgetting me.

1104
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:28,960
- Who?
- My daughter.

1105
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:35,820
She's the reason you wanted
to cross the bridge.

1106
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:39,330
I just wanted
to see her again.

1107
01:10:39,330 --> 01:10:42,010
I never should have
left Santa Cecilia.

1108
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:45,070
I wish I could apologize.

1109
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:49,070
I wish I could tell her that her
papa was trying to come home.

1110
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:51,660
That he loved her so much.

1111
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:55,890
My Coco...

1112
01:10:57,810 --> 01:10:59,630
Coco?

1113
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:18,830
Where did you get this?

1114
01:11:18,830 --> 01:11:22,650
That's my Mama Coco.
That's my Mama Imelda.

1115
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,690
Is that you?

1116
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:33,830
- We're...
- Family?

1117
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:48,730
I always hoped
I'd see her again.

1118
01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:51,130
That she'd miss me.

1119
01:11:51,130 --> 01:11:55,220
Maybe put up my photo.
But it never happened.

1120
01:11:56,370 --> 01:11:58,500
You know the worst part?

1121
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:00,770
Even if I never got to see
Coco in the living world...

1122
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:04,380
I thought at least
one day I'd see her here.

1123
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:06,100
Give her the biggest hug.

1124
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:11,880
But she's the last person
who remembers me.

1125
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:14,150
The moment she's gone
from the living world...

1126
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:18,060
You disappear...
from this one.

1127
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:19,930
You'll never get to see her.

1128
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:21,940
Ever again.

1129
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:28,070
You know,
I wrote her a song once.

1130
01:12:28,070 --> 01:12:32,070
We used to sing it every
night at the same time.

1131
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:34,820
No matter
how far apart we were.

1132
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:38,450
What I wouldn't give
to sing it to her

1133
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:41,400
one... last... time.

He stole your songs.

01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:56,260
You should be the one the world
remembers, not de la Cruz!

1148
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:59,030
I didn't write Remember Me
for the world.

1149
01:13:59,030 --> 01:14:00,940
I wrote it for Coco.

1150
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:05,630
I'm a pretty sorry excuse
for a great-great-grandpa.

1151
01:14:05,630 --> 01:14:08,900
Are you kidding? A minute ago I
thought I was related to a murderer.

1152
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:11,170
You're a total upgrade.

1153
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:13,810
My whole life,
there's been something...

1154
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:15,540
that made me different.

1155
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:17,830
And I never knew
where it came from.

1156
01:14:18,650 --> 01:14:22,180
But now I know.
It comes from you.

1157
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:27,050
I'm proud we're family!
I'm proud to be his family!

1158
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:36,830
I'm proud to be
his family!

1159
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:53,680
Dante?

1160
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:56,120
Dante!

1161
01:14:58,690 --> 01:15:00,270
It's Dante!

1162
01:15:11,870 --> 01:15:15,150
- Imelda!
- Hector.

1163
01:15:15,570 --> 01:15:17,150
You look good.

1164
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:31,590
Dante! You knew he was my
Papa Hector the whole time!

1165
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:33,590
You are a real spirit guide.

1166
01:15:33,590 --> 01:15:36,120
Who's the good spirit guide?
You are!

1167
01:15:47,030 --> 01:15:48,350
Whoa!

1168
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:57,290
Dante!

1169
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:22,240
There they are!

1170
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:26,590
Miguel! Miguelito! Look, it's Miguel!
He's all right.

1171
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:31,090
Gracias, Dios mio.
Que bueno.

1172
01:16:45,190 --> 01:16:47,230
Mijo, I was so worried!

1173
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:49,480
Thank goodness
we found you in time.

1174
01:16:50,430 --> 01:16:53,970
And you... How many times
must I turn you away?

1175
01:16:53,970 --> 01:16:55,240
Imelda.

1176
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:58,440
I want nothing to do with you!
Not in life, not in death!

1177
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:02,080
I spent decades protecting
my family from your mistakes.

1178
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,080
He spends
five minutes with you

1179
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,810
and I have to fish him
out of a sinkhole!

1180
01:17:05,810 --> 01:17:07,350
I wasn't in there
because of Hector.

1181
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:09,980
He was in there
because of me.

1182
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:12,250
He was just
trying to get me home!

1183
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:16,720
I didn't want to listen,
but he was right.

1184
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:19,010
Nothing's more
important than family.

1185
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:22,650
I'm ready
to accept your blessing.

1186
01:17:23,070 --> 01:17:25,100
And your conditions.

1187
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:27,400
But first,
I need to find de la Cruz.

1188
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,270
To get Hector's photo.

1189
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:30,970
- What?
- So he can see Coco again.

1190
01:17:30,970 --> 01:17:32,870
Hector should be
on our ofrenda.

1191
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:34,340
He's part of our family.

1192
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:35,810
He left this family!

1193
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:37,480
He tried to go home
to you and Coco.

1194
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:39,460
But de la Cruz
murdered him!

1195
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:42,260
It's true, Imelda.

1196
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:44,480
And so what if it's true?

1197
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:46,990
You leave me alone
with a child to raise...

1198
01:17:46,990 --> 01:17:49,090
and I'm just
supposed to forgive you?

1199
01:17:49,090 --> 01:17:51,020
Imelda, I...

1200
01:17:51,030 --> 01:17:53,260
Hector!

1201
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:58,610
I'm running out of time.
It's Coco.

1202
01:17:59,770 --> 01:18:01,450
She's forgetting you.

1203
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:05,240
You don't have
to forgive him.

1204
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:07,560
But we shouldn't
forget him.

1205
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:13,380
I wanted to forget you.

1206
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:16,280
I wanted Coco
to forget you too, but...

1207
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:19,330
This is my fault.
Not yours.

1208
01:18:21,390 --> 01:18:23,540
I'm sorry, Imelda.

1209
01:18:27,430 --> 01:18:31,160
Miguel, if we help you
get his photo,

1210
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:32,900
you will return home?

1211
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,480
No more music?

1212
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:38,090
Family comes first.

1213
01:18:39,770 --> 01:18:43,220
I can't forgive you.

1214
01:18:45,450 --> 01:18:47,400
But I will help you.

1215
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:51,330
So, how do we get
to de la Cruz?

1216
01:18:52,290 --> 01:18:55,100
I might know a way.

1217
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:48,120
- Good luck, muchacho.
- Gracias, Frida.

1218
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:59,890
- Here, let me help you with...
- Don't touch me!

1219
01:19:59,890 --> 01:20:02,160
- Everyone clear on the plan?
- Find Hector's photo.

1220
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,990
- Give it to Miguel.
- Send Miguel home.

1221
01:20:03,990 --> 01:20:05,840
Got your petals?

1222
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:08,490
Now, we just
have to find de la Cruz.

1223
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:09,810
Yes?

1224
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:12,580
Don't I know you?

1225
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:16,170
That's for murdering
the love of my life!

1226
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:18,240
- Who... Who the...
- She's talking about me!

1227
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:19,540
I'm the love of your life?

1228
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:21,310
I don't know.
I'm still angry at you.

1229
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:22,640
Hector!
How did you...

1230
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:25,580
And that's for trying
to murder my grandson.

1231
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:27,980
- Grandson?
- She's talking about me!

1232
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:32,150
You! Wait.
You're related to Hector?

1233
01:20:32,150 --> 01:20:33,700
The photo!

1234
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:37,060
Uh...

1235
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:38,770
After him!

1236
01:20:40,930 --> 01:20:43,130
Security! Ayudenme!

1237
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:46,200
- You said love of your life.
- I don't know what I said.

1238
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,620
That's what I heard.

1239
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:02,900
Places, Senor.
You're on in thirty seconds.

1240
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:12,370
Ay! Miguel! I have it!

1241
01:21:21,070 --> 01:21:22,380
Oh!

1242
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:29,920

Too hard to let him
destroy everything.

Hector's the real musician.

1290
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:09,460
You're just the guy
who murdered him

1291
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:10,700
and stole his songs!

1292
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:11,860
Murdered?

1293

Miguel, it's almost sunrise.

1317

No, no. I can't leave you.

1318
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:48,320
I promised
I'd put your photo up.

1319
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:50,460
I promised you'd see Coco.

Mama Coco, please.

Miguel,
open this door!

1340
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:30,860
Here. This was
his guitar, right?

1341
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:32,340
He used to play it to you?
