00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,259
Thanks for the food.

2
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,493
You're that guy from the last game.

3
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:37,474
Do you want to live?

4
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,650
I...

5
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:55,913
I'll die too.

6
00:01:58,827 --> 00:01:59,657
Is that so?

7
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,621
I got it.

8
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,914
Thanks for the food.

LIFE IN THE WOODS BY HENRY DAVID THOREAU

10
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,887
It's so beautiful.

11
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:05,894
Yes.

12
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,023
Father.

13
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,560
If God exists,

14
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,153
what would you wish for?

15
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,584
Please create more mountains
around the world!

16
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,043
Mountains that no one has ever climbed.

17
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,044
Please!

18
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,127
You're so strange!

19
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:45,514
I don't think there are any mountains
that have not been climbed by humans.

20
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,135
And you, Yuzuha?

21
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,478
Please let things stay like this forever!

22
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,569
Mountains.

23
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,158
They are the only place...

24
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:12,163
where I'm accepted as I am.

25
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:20,132
And you are the only one
who accepts me as I am, Father.

26
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,758
I just want things
to stay like this forever.

27
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,350
You're so strange.

28
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,700
That's his daughter!

29
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,495
-Ms. Usagi?
-Excuse me!

30
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,829
Can we please have a word with you?

31
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:56,915
There are claims

32
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,749
that his solo no-oxygen climb
on the Southwest route was staged.

33
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:03,876
-Your response, please!
-Have you heard anything from your father?

34
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,125
-Ms. Yuzuha Usagi?
-Ms. Usagi?

35
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:08,890
Welcome home.

36
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,268
Father.

37
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:18,404
I don't know who came up with
that sham article,

38
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,567
but I never lie.

39
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,743
Where are you going?

40
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:32,832
The mountains.

41
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,342
Father?

42
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,676
The mountains.

43
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,190
They accept me for who I am.

44
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,042
-Mr. Usagi?
-You're Shigenori Usagi, right?

45
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:27,086
STAGED?!

46
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,093
SOLO NO-OXYGEN MOUNTAIN CLIMBING
SUSPECTED TO BE STAGED

47
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,596
HE USED AN OXYGEN TANK

48
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,598
IT WAS AN IMPOSSIBLE CHALLENGE
IN THE FIRST PLACE

49
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,981
DID USAGI STAGE THE ENTIRE EVENT?

550-STRONG SEARCH PARTY
LOOK FOR MISSING CLIMBER

{\an8}WORLD-FAMOUS MOUNTAINEER MISSING

53
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:55,119
{\an8}SHINEGORI USAGI COMMITS SUICIDE
FOLLOWING RUMORS OF STAGED CLIMB?

54
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,831
SUICIDE

55
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,731
Thanks for the food.

56
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,778
Why did you save me?

57
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,260
Your body is saying that it wants to live.

58
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,347
My body?

59
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,060
My body wants to live...

60
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,232
But there's no point in me living.

61
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,025
Everyone died.

62
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,788
Because I was the only one who survived.

63
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:11,132
Everyone died because I survived.

64
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,263
I was the one who killed all of them.

65
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,518
I killed them!

66
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,307
Someone like me...

67
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,015
It's unforgivable
for someone like me to be alive!

68
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,531
I'll die.

69
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,866
I'll die.

70
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,829
I'll die!

71
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,287
I'll die and go to them.

72
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:53,501
I have to kneel and apologize to them!

73
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:58,094
I have to apologize to them right now!

74
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,649
Even so.

75
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,693
Why?

76
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,698
My body.

77
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,793
It's saying that it's hungry.

78
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:37,971
There have been times
I've wanted to die, too.

79
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,555
But I'm the same as you.

80
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,981
I laid down for so long

81
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,936
that my stomach started getting hungry.

82
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,113
I'm going to die anyway.

83
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,792
I might die during tomorrow's game,

84
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,164
or I might die when my visa expires.

85
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,295
I made the effort to cook that for you,

86
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,965
so you should eat it before you die.

87
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,556
Get ready.

88
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,478
You're joining the game, right?

89
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,817
Are you planning to die
by letting your visa expire?

90
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,340
Why did you scream at that time?

91
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,641
During the tag game.

92
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,229
You tried to save everyone
even at the cost of your life.

93
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,805
-Everyone!
-Hey!

94
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,774
The tagger is currently
on the second level of the central area!

95
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:42,015
Let's inform each other
of the tagger's location

96
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,027
and search for the safezone together!

97
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,948
That's because I didn't want to die.

98
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,706
I didn't want everyone to die.

99
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,674
I'm the same.

100
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,264
I don't want you to die.

101
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,480
If you hadn't shouted, I would have died.

102
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:28,819
Let me return the favor.

103
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,895
{\an8}THIS WAY TO THE GAME ARENA

104
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,381

105

{\an8}FACIAL RECOGNITION IN PROGRESS
PLEASE WAIT A MOMENT

106
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,071
You guys aren't new to this.

107
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,855
What about you guys?

108
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,241
The three of us
cleared four games together.

109
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,119
We happened to be together
in our first game,

110
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,832
and we stuck together after that.

111
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:28,418
Having friends makes the difference
between winning and losing.

112
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,131
Your leg. Are you injured?

113
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:36,723
Yes,

114
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,933
I guess I sprained it.

115
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,432
During a game?

116
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,596
Well, yes.

117
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,321
Hey, it's starting.

118
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,235
<i>Registration has closed.</i>

119
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,359

120
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,737

121
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,701
<i>Distance.</i>

122
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,334
Distance.

<i>Rule. Endure the trial</i>
<i>and reach the goal within the time limit.</i>

<i>Clear condition. Reach the goal safely.</i>

125
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,588
What's this?

126
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,346
<i>Game start.</i>

127
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,969
{\an8}<i>One hundred twenty minutes remaining.</i>

128
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,225
Are they asking us to run?

129
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,476
What do you think, Seizan?

130
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:38,701
Distance?

131
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,200
Are we supposed
to run on a highway or something?

132
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,245
Run? Oh, no...

133
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,540
Takuma. It will be fine.

134
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,094
Sit there.

135
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,801
This bus has a carburetor model
from the early 1970s.

136
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,802
If I can just get the engine started...

137
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,935
Damn it, no gas!

138
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,361
Then I guess we have no choice but to run.

139
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,741
Leave me.

140
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,450
Takuma!

141
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,708
I'm not saying

142
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,501
that I'll sacrifice myself and die here!

143
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,012
I'll search for a way for me to survive,

144
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:41,931
so you guys go ahead.

145
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,966
-There's no way we can do that!
-Yamane!

146
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,226
You have to clear the game!

147
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,364
You want to see your wife again, right?

148
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,399
And the baby in her belly!

149
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,320
If you die,
what's going to happen to your family?

150
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,788
Don't mind me.

151
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,787
I'll figure something out.

152
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:24,553
Yamane.

153
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,675
Let's go.

154
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:33,943
Go.

155
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:36,766
Please.

156
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:38,859
It was fun with you guys.

157
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:49,788
Let's go.

158
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,463
We should go.

159
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,893
It's the right thing to do.

160
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,107
<i>One hundred ten minutes remaining.</i>

161

Arisu.

162
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,309
Live on for us.

163
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,140
Thank you.

164
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,092

166
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:43,397
<i>They told us to reach the goal,</i>

167
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,496
<i>Distance, 5,000.</i>

168
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,419
What's over there?

169
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,891
REPLENISHMENT STATION

170
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,555
What a lifesaver.

171
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,908
Wait. Are you going to drink it?

172
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,199
Is this a test for us?

173
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:43,832
How can that be?

174
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,591
Take this.

175
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,051
Thanks.

176
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:08,976
I feel so alive now.

177
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,737
Is that fine?

178
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,624
Yes.

179
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,773
<i>Distance, 6,000.</i>

180
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,808
This place is kind of dark.

181
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:57,950
This is tough. This is more like
a Spades game than a Clubs game.

182
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:02,748
Something's there.

183
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,256
There's nothing.

184
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,719
No. Something's there.

185
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:33,942
Arisu.

186
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:58,949
Damn it!

187
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,091
Run!

188
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:28,774
Shit. This is seriously bad!

189
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:37,983
Go!

190
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,525
Just go!

191
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,275
Seizan!

192
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,624
-Let's go!
-Seizan!

193
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,581
Seizan!

194
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:51,291
Seizan!

195
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,092
I can't run any further.

196
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:58,547
You can do it!

197
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,220
I'm...

198
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:07,675
all alone now.

199
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:17,977
I was only with them for a week.

200
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,741
But it felt as if...

201
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,527
we had been friends for a long time.

202
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:38,671
Live on and talk about them
with your wife.

203
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:50,427
You're right.

204
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,744
<i>Distance, 8,000.</i>

205
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:22,883
What's the matter?

206
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,048
This motorcycle.

207
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,349
It's a Royal Enfield.

208
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:32,562
You know your stuff.

209
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,597
It's a rare motorcycle
that uses a diesel engine.

210
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,153
But things like this still work, huh?

211
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:46,404
Since they don't have IC chips installed.

212
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:49,656
I see.

213
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,910
It's the electrical circuits.

214
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,998
All the electrical circuits
around this area have been destroyed.

215
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,870
So what?

216
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,997
So in contrast, analog equipment
can be operated here.

217
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,335
It means old motorcycles or cars
may work here.

218
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,341
Whether it's this motorcycle
or the bus at the starting point!

219
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,597
But there are no batteries.

220
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:18,016
You said this motorcycle is a rare model
that uses a diesel engine, right?

221
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,152
Yes.

222
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,608
So it runs on diesel fuel
instead of gasoline.

223
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,730
That bus runs on diesel too!

224
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,571
So we have to carry this all the way
back to the starting point?

225
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:33,326
If we transport the fuel back there,
we can save him.

226
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,910
Are you saying that you'll save Takuma?

227
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:36,995
But if you go,

228
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,247
you can't clear the game!

229
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,382
There's still time.

230
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,378
We still have half the duration left.

231
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,710
Usagi, you head to the goal with him!

232
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,756
I'll be right behind. If the bus moves,
we'll reach the goal easily.

233
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,300
Letting someone die so I can survive...

234
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,641
I'll never do that again.

235
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,951
<i>Distance, 7,000.</i>

236
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,416
<i>Distance, 10,000.</i>

237
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,437
<i>Distance, 12,000.</i>

238
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,611
<i>Distance, 4,000.</i>

239
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,001
What?

240
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,506
Is that the goal?

241
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,219
So we'll wait for them here?

242
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,729
<i>Distance, 1,000.</i>

243
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,815
<i>Fifteen minutes remaining.</i>

244
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,526
Hey!

245
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,089
Hey!

246
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,391
Hey!

247
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,663
{\an8}ENTRY PROHIBITED

248
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,157
Is that your wife?

249
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,380
The baby's supposed to be due in autumn.

250
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,982
I'm sure they must be safe somewhere.

251
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:54,896
I'm sure of it.

252
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,410
Everyone.

253
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,995
They should all be safe somewhere.

254
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,329
They didn't just disappear into thin air.

255
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,636
So we have to survive and go back.

256
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,938
<i>Five minutes remaining.</i>

257
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,404
I wonder if they can make it here.

258
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:46,658
What was that?

259
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:52,537
What was that?

260
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,640
Water?

261
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,191
I can't run anymore!

262
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,574
You have to run! Don't look back!

263
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,207
Damn it!

264
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,812
Usagi!

265
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,362
Arisu!

266
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,659
Arisu.

267
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,640
It hurts.

268
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:55,772
Is everyone all right?

269
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,833
Thanks.

270
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,483
I was always...

271
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,226
right inside the goal?

272
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,949
<i>It was written there right from the start.</i>

273
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,317
<i>This was the goal.</i>

274
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,951
So what did those numbers mean?

275
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:57,912
Distance from the goal.

276
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,037
<i>It should have been zero.</i>

277
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,466
<i>Game cleared.</i>

278
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,548
<i>Congratulations.</i>

279
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,386
Are you all right?

280
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,114
Thanks.

281
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:35,987
Where are you going?

282
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,212
Who knows?

283
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,802
I don't know myself.

284
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,773
If we're still alive...

285
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,982
let's meet somewhere, okay?

286
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:34,721
The Beach?

287
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,215
Maybe the people
who disappeared are there.

288
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:41,977
Could it be
some sort of evacuation shelter?

289
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,731
I don't know.

290
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,149
But I'm sure we'll find our answer there.

291
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,862
I want to believe in what Karube said.

292
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,453
I'll avenge everyone.

293
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,791
I'll stop the mastermind of this game

294
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:02,909
and return the world to how it was before.

295
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:06,537
I will live.

296
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:11,711
To do that,

297
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,297
I must go to the Beach.

298
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,581
You really don't know
how to ride a bicycle?

299
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,000
I never learned how to ride one.

300
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,080
Even though you're so athletic?

301
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,545
But this feels nice.

302
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:14,273
