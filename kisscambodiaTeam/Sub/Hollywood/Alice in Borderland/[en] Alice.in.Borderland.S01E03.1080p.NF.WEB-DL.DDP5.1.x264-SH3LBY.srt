1
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,044
That person...

2
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,752
I killed her.

3
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,510
Everyone was made
to participate in the game.

4
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,223
It's no one's fault.

5
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,519
Just what in the world is this?

6
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,106
Who knows? I don't know either.

7
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,477
But...

8
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:11,196
It amazes me
that I'm willing to do anything

9
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,622
just so that I can survive.

10
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,001
If we weren't willing,
we might as well die.

11
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,272
My visa ends today.

12
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,863
{\an8}Do you even know how hard I worked
to get into this company?

13
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,365
I even had to have sex
with someone like that.

14
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,905
I finally got promoted too.

15
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:09,995
Saori,

16
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,833
I talked to the HR department already.

17
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:13,415

00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,474
SPECIAL PROMOTION FOR ASSISTANT
IN THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM

22
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,932
I will survive

23
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,523
and return to my original life.

24
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,279
Arisu! Karube!

25
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,895
I'm so glad!

26
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,988
I was so worried because you guys
didn't come back this morning..

27
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,528
I'm so glad!

28
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,826
Hey.

29
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,039
-Chota!
-That hurts!

30
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,211
You're hurt?

31
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,004
I'm fine.

32
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,672
Someone radioed in?

33
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,170
Yes.

34
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:02,804
Thanks.

35
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,719
If we go to that place called the Beach,

36
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,231
we might be able to discover something.

37
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,233
Like where all the people
who disappeared went?

38
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,518
Could there be an evacuation shelter?

39
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,234
Maybe everyone else is there.

40
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,905
Are the closest beaches to us
in Shonan, Izu, and Ito?

41
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,449
They're so far.

42
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,792
We can get there.
It's just a matter of time.

43
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,205
What should we do?

44
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:33,955
Shall we try going there?

45
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,171
In any case,

46
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,705
we have no choice
but to trust that voice for now.

47
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,049
Chota won't be able to make it
with his leg injury.

48
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:46,763
You're right.

49
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,142
Both of us...

50
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,595
Our visas will expire today.

51
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:02,277
We'll clear today's game
and increase your visa days.

52
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,532
And then,

53
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,700
let's search for the Beach tomorrow.

54
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,385
I will go to the Beach.

55
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,428
No matter what.

56
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,313
I will do anything it takes.

57
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,307
We still have hope.

58
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,421
<i>It amazes me</i>
<i>that I'm willing to do anything</i>

59
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,553
just so that I can survive.

60
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,966
If we weren't willing,
we might as well die.

61
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:23,855
Arisu?

62
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,621
What's the matter?

63
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:38,922
It's nothing.

64
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,059
Say something.

65
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,980
Like what?

66
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,272
Let's see, like gossip?

67
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,696
I saw someone die in front of me.

68
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,116
But I survived.

69
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,249
How should I say this?

70
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,119
You were glad.

71
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,089
Were you relieved?

72
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,839
I didn't think about that, but...

73
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,774
Even so...

74
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,438
I guess I do want to survive.

75
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,198
I told you that last time, right?

76
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,698
During my first game,

77
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,084
everyone except for me died.

78
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,286
I don't want to die like that.

79
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,207
I knew...

80
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,722
I wanted to survive.

81
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,953
Found it!

82
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,724
Please stay safe.

83
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,032
THIS WAY TO THE GAME ARENA

84
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,541
He's late.

85
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,166
Hey, should we just go?

86
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,880
No, we'll wait for Karube.

87
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,718
If we don't join the game,
both of us will die.

88
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,259
Let's go, Chota.

89
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,391
Both of you still have days left
on your visas.

90
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:54,986
Karube!

91
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,073
Sorry.

92
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,577
-I went to pick up something.
-What do you mean, "sorry"?

93
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,041
Shibuki and I...

94
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,168
This is the end for us.

95
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,053
What's going on?

96
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,804
Don't be so angry.

97
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,139
There's no time. Let's go.

98
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,020
Thank you.

99
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,501
Shall we?

100
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:52,062
SHINJUKU NATURAL BOTANICAL GARDEN

101
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,715
FEEL FREE TO USE ANY OF THESE

102
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,938
Are we going to dismantle something?

103
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:39,532
I'll have this.

104
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,030
That looks really impressive.

105
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,090

REGISTRATION IN PROGRESS
CURRENT PARTICIPANTS

111
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,777
What is this?

112
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,240
It recognized Chota.

113
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,124
The target cursor turned red
when our eyes met.

114
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,330
It's eye-tracking.

115
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,905
What are they making us do this time?

116
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,666
<i>Registration has closed.</i>

117
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,747
<i>The game will now commence.</i>

118
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,165
THERE ARE CURRENTLY 4 PARTICIPANTS

119
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,053
<i>Difficulty, Seven of Hearts.</i>

120
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,971
Hearts.

121
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,839
Hearts? Isn't it...

122
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:32,096
The suit on a playing card
usually signifies the game genre.

123
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,101
Club refers to a team battle,
and Diamond refers to a battle of wits.

124
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,774
As for Heart...

125
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,693
It's a game of betrayal
where you play with people's hearts.

126
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,283
Seven. Isn't this quite difficult then?

127
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,149
This is terrible.

128
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,816
What should we do?

129
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,697
<i>Game, "Hide-and-seek."</i>

130
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:56,159
<i>Rule. One person will be the wolf,</i>
<i>and the other three will be the lambs.</i>

131
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,536
<i>The one found by the wolf</i>
<i>will become the next wolf.</i>

132
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,050
<i>Hide well</i>
<i>so that the wolf does not discover you.</i>

133
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,720
<i>Clear condition. Whoever is</i>
<i>the wolf at the end of the game wins.</i>

134
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,717
<i>Time limit, 15 minutes.</i>

135
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,392
<i>After 15 minutes,</i>

136
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,813
<i>the collars</i>
<i>around all the lambs will explode.</i>

137
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,023
What?

138
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,687
What is going on?

139
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,110
What does this mean?

140
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,645
How is this possible?

141
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,533
What?

142
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,990
This means only one person will survive.

143
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,372
What?

144
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,004
We'll play hide-and-seek,

145
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,957
and the person who is the wolf
at the end of the game wins.

146
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,384
The other three will die.

147
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,130
It's a simple game, huh?

148
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:51,642
<i>The first wolf is</i>

149
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:56,469
<i>ID number 1000247.</i>

150
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,061
<i>Chota Segawa.</i>

151
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,233
Me?

152
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,895
<i>Game start.</i>

153
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,571
<i>Fifteen minutes remaining.</i>

154
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,166
Stop it, Chota! If you try to
force it open, the collar might explode!

155
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:30,634
-Stop it!
-Then what should I do?

156
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,353
Arisu?

157
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,895
When two people lock eyes,
the wolf's role is passed on.

158
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,608
There's a flaw with the game.

159
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,571
If the wolf survives,

160
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,948
there's no point to the lambs hiding!

161
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,369
What should we do, Arisu?

162
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,502
Everyone!

163
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,801
Shibuki?

164
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,393
The one that needs to hide is the wolf!

165
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,309
-Are we going to die?
-We will if this continues.

166
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,558
But it'll be fine.

167
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,184
Shibuki!

168
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,096
-Karube!
-Karube!

169
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,980
Hey!

170
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:31,856
Wait up!

171
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,120
Hey!

172
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,078
Shibuki!

173
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,968
TROPICAL RAINFOREST

174
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,579
Come out!

175
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,332
Shibuki!

176
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,569
<i>You can hear me, right, Shibuki?</i>

177
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,950
Shibuki!

178
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,791
<i>Don't run away.</i>

179
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,623
<i>Let's think of a way together.</i>

180
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,421
I'm sorry.

181
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,246
I'm sorry.

182
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,798
What's the point in apologizing now? Hey!

183
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,930
-Look at me!
-Get off!

184
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,717
<i>Stop it, Karube!</i>

185
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,517
Hey!

186
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,147
Look over here!

187
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,488
Damn it...

188
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:07,138
<i>Look over here, damn it!</i>

189
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,184
<i>Hey!</i>

190
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:11,731
You fucking bitch!

191
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,105
Karube!

192
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:24,986
Arisu!

193
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,619
Both of you, stop that already!

194
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:31,163
Please! If we work together as usual,
we might be able to figure things out!

195
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,958
You're too naive.
This is a game of Hearts.

196
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,257
<i>What is happening to all of you?</i>

197
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,232
-<i>You guys are acting weird!</i>
-Damn you, Arisu!

198
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,305
<i>Aren't we on the same side?</i>

199
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,320
<i>Time remaining, ten minutes.</i>

200
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,200
<i>Hey!</i>

201
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:05,948
<i>Arisu!</i>

202
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,783
O Holy Mother...

203
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,329
-Please save us from our tainted souls.
<i>-Where are you?</i>

204
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,253
<i>Arisu!</i>

205
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,878
Our smiles are the light of hope.

206
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,922
The Holy Mother will appear when we smile.

207
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:22,798
O Holy Mother...

208
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:27,547
-Please save us from our tainted souls.
<i>-Hey!</i>

209
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:28,467
<i>Hey!</i>

210
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,602
Our smiles are the light of hope.

211
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,938
The Holy Mother will appear when we smile.

212
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:37,612
<i>Damn it!</i>

213
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,150
<i>O Holy Mother,</i>

214
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,490
<i>please save us from our tainted souls.</i>

215
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,493
<i>Our smiles are the light of hope.</i>

216
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,118
<i>The Holy Mother will appear when we smile.</i>

217
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,416
So that's how bad you want to survive.

218
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,842
Just give me a bit of time!

219
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,264
I will think of a solution to this game!

220
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,722
You'll think of a solution?

221
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,983
You just want
to be the only survivor, right?

222
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,234
It doesn't matter if you're dead!

223
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,363
Let me be the wolf.

224
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,030
You've been living
a half-assed life anyway!

225
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,741
There's no point if someone

226
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,990
who has the will to live on dies!

227
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,077
Arisu.

228
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,416
There is no hope left after all!

229
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,680
Chota!

230
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,431
-Let me go!
-Go! Quick!

231
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,677
Let me go!

232
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,354
Wait!

233
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,070
Don't go, Karube!

234
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,321
Let me go!

235
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,113
I let you fuck me!

236
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,321
Do you know who's on your side?

237
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,697
<i>Let me go!</i>

238
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,503
<i>Let go!</i>

239
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,752
<i>-O Holy Mother...</i>
<i>-Let me go!</i>

240
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,006
<i>Eight minutes remaining.</i>

241
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,097
-<i>Let go!</i>
-<i>I can't!</i>

242
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,685
<i>Arisu!</i>

243
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,398
Where are you, Arisu? Come out!

244
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,950
Damn it.

245
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,780
<i>Are you planning</i>
<i>to just hide the entire time?</i>

246
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,528
Damn it!

247
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,325
<i>You lied to us.</i>

248
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,548
<i>And you said</i>
<i>it'll work out if we cooperate?</i>

249
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:11,178
You just wanted to be the only survivor
in the first place!

250
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,136
Damn it!

251
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,097
Damn it!

252
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,770
I don't know what to do anymore.

253
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,646
<i>Let go of me!</i>

254
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:07,651
I'm sorry.

255
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,990
I'm sorry!

256
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,702
<i>What's the point in apologizing now?</i>

257
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,121
<i>Arisu!</i>

258
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,873
In the end,

259
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,413
that's all you can say?

260
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,714
<i>Ever since you dropped out of university...</i>

261
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,213
<i>Hey.</i>

262
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,300
<i>All you've ever done is say sorry!</i>

263
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,885
<i>-Hey!</i>
-I'm sorry.

264
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,597
I'm sorry!

265
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,730
I'm sorry.

266
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,358
Congratulations
on your acceptance, Hajime.

267
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,494
You really did your best.

268
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,528
Your mother would be so happy.

269
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,662
But this is just the beginning.

270
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,292
Even if I go to university,
I might end up like Ryohei.

271
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:08,081
Your brother doesn't devote himself
to anything. But you do.

272
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,748
You have something to work hard on.

273
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,129
You are different from Ryohei.

274
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,509
Ryohei, why don't you come over
and have some, too?

275
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,033
<i>If you're just going to be</i>
<i>a loser forever,</i>

276
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:38,242
<i>then let me be the wolf!</i>

277
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,616
<i>Arisu!</i>

278
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,880
<i>Five minutes remaining.</i>

279
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,013
<i>Enough already.</i>

280
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:06,428
I don't care who survives in the end.

281
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:12,481
But...

282
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,611
I don't want it to end this way!

283
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,511
<i>Is this about Arisu and Chota again?</i>

284
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,024
You're really kind.

285
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,493
<i>I don't really expect anything from you.</i>

286
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,198
Hajime...

287
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,084
This is awesome.

288
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,293
It's really good!

289
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,122
<i>Arisu.</i>

290
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,581
<i>I have a dream.</i>

291
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,881
<i>I want to buy a huge farm in Australia.</i>

292
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,841
<i>I'll invite you guys over,</i>
<i>and we'll drink beer all day!</i>

293
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,307
<i>That sounds nice!</i>

294
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:34,928
<i>Then I'll deliver the highest-quality</i>
<i>beef steak to you through drone delivery!</i>

295
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,895
<i>The drone will be fully automated.</i>
<i>I'll make an app for it!</i>

296
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,900
<i>All right then.</i>

297
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,978
<i>-Cheers to our future!</i>
<i>-Cheers!</i>

298
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,446
<i>You better keep your promise,</i>
<i>you hear that?</i>

299
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,083
<i>Time remaining, three minutes.</i>

300
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:56,018
I'll drop out.

301
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:02,685
<i>I'll drop out of this game.</i>

302
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,818
You guys...

303
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,244
are all I have.

304
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,447
If someone has to survive this game,

305
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:19,705
it's not me.

306
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,167
I'll leave the game.

307
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:32,014
Karube, Chota. Where are you guys?

308
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,057
<i>Karube, Chota.</i>

309
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:45,897
Karube!

310
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:47,781
Chota!

311
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:49,898
<i>Hey!</i>

312
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:56,623
Chota!

313
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,002
Chota?

314
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,417
Where are you?

315
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,174
Chota!

316
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,048
Chota!

317
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:17,853
Chota?

318
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:20,847
Where are you?

319
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,353
Chota!

320
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,523
YOU BECOME THE WOLF IF YOU ARE FOUND
HIDE WELL SO THE WOLF WON'T FIND YOU

321
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,186
Karube!

322
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,565
Chota!

323
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,527
Where are you guys?

324
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,816
Please come out!

325
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,279
Hey!

326
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,079
HIDE SO THAT THE WOLF WON'T FIND YOU

327
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,417
Karube! Where are you?

328
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,471
Why are you guys keeping silent now?

329
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,721
Karube!

330
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:06,103
HIDE WELL, SHEEP

331
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,056
Where are you guys?

332
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,034
Karube!

333
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,065
Chota!

334
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,162
Chota!

335
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:22,577
Karube!

336
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,041
Come out, please!

337
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:27,877
Shut up!

338
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,133
Karube!

339
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,969
Making a ruckus like idiots

340
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,984
and drinking the whole night away.

341
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,308
When I'm with you guys,

342
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,068
I forget about all the troubles I have.

343
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:59,066
<i>You remember, right? That hot summer day</i>
<i>we made noodles with shaved ice.</i>

344
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:02,366
Karube, where are you?

345
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:05,655
Karube!

346
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,304
We laughed a lot then, didn't we?

347
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,510
Chota?

348
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:20,138
Chota laughed so hard
that noodles came out from his nose.

349
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,466
You don't have to mention that.

350
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:28,394
Where are you guys? Chota, Karube!

351
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,269
Arisu.

352
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,531
Live on for us.

353
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,996
Karube!

354
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,620
Chota!

355
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,753
<i>Thirty seconds remaining.</i>

356
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:03,852
<i>It's not me.</i>

357
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,434
I shouldn't be the one to stay alive!

358
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,064
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

359
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,143
I'm behind you.

360
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,031
I'm sorry.

361
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,283
I'm sorry, Shibuki.

362
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,612
-<i>Ten seconds.</i>
-Arisu.

363
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,370
Thank you.

364
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:29,041
<i>-Five. Four. Three. Two.</i>
-Karube!

365
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,961
<i>-One.</i>
-Karube!

366
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:35,157
