AUDI AND BMW

4
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,635
What a shitty brother.

5
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,555
Crap!

6
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:03,607
Shit.

7
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,482
Skipped your interview again?

8
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,573
After I begged them to consider you,
you're playing games?

9
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,117
Did I ever tell you to do that?

10
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,617
Dad also said
this is the last time he's helping.

11
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,876
He won't help you
look for jobs anymore.

12
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,457
I'm saying
that I never asked for your help.

13
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:29,916
But you needed it.

14
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,514
You're just a parasite at home.

15
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,564
Okay, I'm leaving then.

16
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,854
If only we could reset reality.

17
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,984
It was way better
when Mom was still alive.

18
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,250
Ryohei.

19
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,876
Just don't get in your brother's way.

ARISU RESIDENCE

CHOTA SEGAWA, DAIKICHI KARUBE

22
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,328
ARISU: CAN I GO TO THE BAR?

23
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,327
ARISU: I'M OFFICIALLY HOMELESS

24
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,526
Oh, boss.

25
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,279
-Good day.
-You're early, Karube.

26
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,859
I just happened to come in early.

27
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,697
Why are you here at this time of the day?

28
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,532
I have some business to attend to.

29
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,997
ARISU: KARUBE, YOU THERE?

30
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:34,462
KARUBE

31
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,667
How dare you put your hands on my woman!

32
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:37,798
-Fuck you!
-Stop it!

33
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,091
Shove it, woman!

34
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,765
I feel better now.

35
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:05,793
{\an8}ARISU:
CHOTA, YOU WORKING? LET ME STAY OVER

36
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:11,459
CHOTA

37
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,139
Here, Mom.

38
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,602
I'm sorry that you have to do this
when you're so busy, Chota.

39
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,560
This will keep me going.

40
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,564
Let's make this the last time, okay?

41
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,359
How can this be the last time?

42
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:40,736
ARISU: HEY, ARE YOU IGNORING ME?

43
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,122
<i>Even the air in Tokyo...</i>

44
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,989
It has been contaminated
by the evilness of mankind.

45
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,995
We need to purify it!

46
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,000
Here, here, and here.
Everything has to be purified!

47
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,713
I got it already!

48
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,335
See you.

49
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:57,843
Thank you!

50
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,893
ARISU: FINE

51
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:24,657
KARUBE: I WAS FIRED FROM MY JOB

52
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,582
Karube has such bad timing!

53
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,458
ARISU: SERIOUSLY? WHEN?

54
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,711
KARUBE:
RIGHT NOW. I'M JOBLESS NOW!

55
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,625
{\an8}ARISU: SERIOUSLY? WHEN?
KARUBE: RIGHT NOW. I'M JOBLESS NOW!

56
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:46,757
{\an8}CHOTA: GOOD JOB GETTING FIRED
I'M SKIPPING WORK RIGHT NOW

57
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:52,017
{\an8}KARUBE:
YOU SHOULD WORK, CHOTA. YOU ARE POOR

58
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,484
{\an8}ARISU: I LEFT HOME

59
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,358
CHOTA: GOOD WORK

60
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,362
ARISU: I NEED A DRINK

61
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,994
CHOTA: ME TOO!

62
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,951
KARUBE: LET'S GO THEN!

63
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,951
ARISU: GO FIND A JOB, KARUBE.

64
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,624
CHOTA: YOU TOO, ARISU.

65
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,710
KARUBE: OKAY,
LET'S MEET IN FRONT OF SHIBUYA STATION

66
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,631
ARISU: OKAY!

67
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,539
ARISU: OKAY!

68
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,546
ARISU: I STEPPED ON SOMEONE'S VOMIT

69
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,093
CHOTA: GOOD JOB STEPPING ON VOMIT

70
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,612
ARISU: I'M HAVING THE WORST DAY

71
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:46,863
CHOTA: ME TOO

72
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,568
KARUBE: SAME

73
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:54,658
{\an8}ARISU: I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE
I'M DOING MY BEST SINCE THIS MORNING

74
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,541
{\an8}KARUBE: ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT YOUR GAME?

75
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,216
ARISU: FOUND YOU, KARUBE!

76
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,352
KARUBE: HEY!

77
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,140
CHOTA: HEY!

78
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,733
ARISU: HEY!

79
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,477
Just talk.

80
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,363
So where to?

81
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,110
There are only a few pubs open, right?

82
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,442
Man.

83
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,160
We're all chased out with nowhere to go.

84
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,122
Oh, well.

85
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,713
Wish I could go to some unknown place.

86
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,708
It would be bad if zombies
were to appear in Shibuya, huh?

87
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,216
If they're all bitten here,
they will all turn into zombies!

88
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,889
Stop it with the zombie talk
and think about which shop to go to.

89
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:52,098
But if zombies were to appear,
I guess only Karube would survive.

90
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,520
You'd knock those zombies out
with one punch.

91
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,059
No, it wouldn't be me.

92
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,852
You'd be the one to survive, Arisu.

93
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,435
Me? Why?

94
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,067
I'm sure you're the one who will survive.

95
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,661
Arisu, you know...

96
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,582
Stop hanging out with us
and go live a normal life.

97
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,620
You can do it.

98
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,369
What?

99
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,337
What's with that?

100
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,008
All right.

101
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,387
Here we go.

102
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,893
-What are you doing?
-Hey!

103
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,937
This is your Independence Day!

104
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,060
Let's take a photo!

105
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,186
Okay!

106
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,693
Passing through!

107
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,935
Move aside!

108
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,776
-Move aside!
-Hey, this is dangerous!

109
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,622
-Hey!
-Come on, let's take a photo!

110
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,196
We're here!

111
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,834
Hey, what are you doing?

112
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,830
Take a photo!

113
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,791
Hey, don't take my picture!

114
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,171
Here, Arisu! Look over here!

115
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,039
Come on, Arisu!

116
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,746
-Here!
-Smile!

117
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,166
Stop it already!

118
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,844
That's a good expression!

119
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,692
This is nice!

120
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,862
Great!

121
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,197
Shibuya!

122
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,754
You're the best!

123
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,132
-Hey!
-Oh, shit!

124
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,679
-Yikes!
-That was close!

125
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,099
-Hurry up!
-Look, fireworks!

126
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,215
Run for your lives!

127
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:52,191
It's the police! This is bad!

128
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,316
Let's run for it!

129
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:55,994
Where to now?

130
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,457
Over there!

131
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,749
Police!

132
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,634
Head for the restroom!

133
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,547
Sorry!

134
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,429
Hurry!

135
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,933
-Just hurry up already!
-Hurry up!

136
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,744
CHOTA: WHO FARTED?

137
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,456
{\an8}CHOTA: WHO WAS IT? OWN UP
AND SNIFF UP YOUR OWN FART!

138
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,417
It was you, right?

139
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,864
Power outage.

140
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,626
I'll go out and check.

141
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,456
Be careful.

142
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:30,759
What?

143
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:18,655
Emi.

144
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:25,586
Emi!

145
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:43,687
WHERE'S THAT FILE?!
GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER! - TAKAGI

146
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,612
Are you serious...

147
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,137
Hey!

148
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,694
Hello?

149
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,574
Anyone here?

150
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,536
Hello?

151
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,441
Did you find anyone?

152
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,483
No.

153
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,108
How was it?

154
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,196
There's no one around at all.

155
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,749
Even our cellphones aren't working.

156
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,598
Could it be an evacuation drill?

157
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,024
What's that?

158
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:12,354
An event? A flash mob, maybe?

159
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,017
The scale is too huge for that.

160
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,741
If only the three of us remain here...

161
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,591
This doesn't seem so bad to me.

162
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,085
What?

163
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,181
Don't you find this exciting?

164
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,603
Are you insane?

165
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,307
You're right. I think this is quite nice.

166
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,266
Hey.

167
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,857
I don't have to go to work.

168
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,071
Have you guys gone crazy?

169
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,073
No one would be angry at us.

170
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,405
And we can eat and drink
all we want, right?

171
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,291
You'll be a virgin your entire life.

172
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,406
I don't want that.

173
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,849
All right!

174
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:30,771
All right.

175
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,023
-Isn't this nice?
-Perfect!

176
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,067
-Hey.
-Arisu!

177
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,861
Stop joking around, you guys!

178
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,154
Karube!

179
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,744
-It hurts!
-Come on, say that it's nice!

180
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,414
Look.

181
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:04,799
WELCOME, PLAYERS
THE GAME WILL COMMENCE IN A MOMENT

182
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:10,564
WELCOME, PLAYERS.
THE GAME WILL COMMENCE IN A MOMENT

183
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,599
Game?

184
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,356
THIS WAY TO THE GAME ARENA

185
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:25,566
Over there.

186
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,315
There are lights.

187
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,078
Is someone there?

188
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:34,833
Let's go.

189
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:35,793
Okay.

190
00:23:57,352 --> 00:24:00,612
GM BUILDING

191
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:37,353
THE GAME ARENA IS UP AHEAD

192
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,698
ONE PER PERSON

193
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:21,041
FACE RECOGNITION IN PROGRESS
PLEASE WAIT A MOMENT

194
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,155
It has facial recognition.

195
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,133
Can we use these phones?

196
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:28,884
There's no signal.

197
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,924
We can't make calls with this.

198
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,176
<i>Please wait for the game to commence.</i>

199
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:39,386
<i>Two minutes until registration closes.</i>

200
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,561
<i>There are currently three participants.</i>

201
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,556
What's this?

202
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,192
A game.

203
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,027
There's a human.

204
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:52,571
Hey.

205
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,112
Do you know where everyone went?

206
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,879
What was that just now?

207
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:14,513
A laser?

208
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:15,631
CONNECT LIGHT
CHOTA SEGAWA

209
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:19,097
Once you cross the borderline,
you can never return.

210
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,814
You have no choice
but to participate in the game.

211
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,370
It might be best not to go any further.

212
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,253
I'm so relieved!

213
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,004
Geez, I thought
I wouldn't find anyone here!

214
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,592
My condolences.

215
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,940
<i>Registration has closed.</i>

216
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,056
{\an8}<i>The game will now commence.</i>

217
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,273
Game?

218
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,614
<i>Game, "Dead or Alive."</i>

219
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,775
DEAD OR ALIVE

220
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,372
<i>Difficulty, Three of Clubs</i>

221
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,198
Three of Clubs?

222
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,874
What does that mean?

223
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,204
<i>Rule.</i>

224
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:30,127
<i>Select the correct door</i>
<i>within the stipulated time.</i>

225
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:31,747
What?

226
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,252
<i>Clear condition.</i>

227
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:36,256
<i>Leave the building within the time limit.</i>

228
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:43,431
START

229
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,810
You'll die if you keep spacing out.

230
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,316
There's no time.

231
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:24,184
<i>The time limit for this room</i>
<i>is two minutes.</i>

232
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,410
What's this?

233
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,285
LIVE

234
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,622
To live...

235
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:53,537
DIE

236
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,625
...or to die.

237
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,048
Is this really a game?

238
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:04,218
This is kind of starting
to get a little exciting.

239
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:11,096
I'm sure this must be some kind of event.

240
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:15,942
I want to go home.

241
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,322
It'll be fine. You're with us!

242
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,570
Let's win the game,
get the prize, and go home.

243
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,660
The prize?

244
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,072
I was hoping that we'd get one.

245
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,617
<i>One minute remaining.</i>

246
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,620
Arisu.

247
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,950
Which do you think it is?

248
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:31,957
Well...

249
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,884
If it's a choice between life and death,

250
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,959
I wouldn't choose the skeleton.

251
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,593
What if we choose the wrong door?

252
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,929
The answer is "Live."

253
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,136
Open the door that says "Live."

254
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,217
How do you know that?

255
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,265
Because obviously, it's the "Live" door!

256
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:55,766
Do you guys smell something?

257
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,520
Hey, look down!

258
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,477
Fire?

259
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,109
<i>Thirty seconds remaining.</i>

260
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,525
The answer is "Live"!

261
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,533
-Hurry up and open the door!
-Open it yourself!

262
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,275
What will happen if the time is up?

263
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,987
We have no time. Hurry up!

264
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:14,787
-Why do you think that's the answer?
-Clearly, we can't choose to die, can we?

265
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,173
<i>Twenty seconds remaining.</i>

266
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,579
I can't stand it anymore!

267
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,470
Did she die?

268
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:34,772
<i>Ten seconds remaining.</i>

269
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,192
DIE

270
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,689
<i>Five. Four. Three.</i>

271
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,275
-Chota!
<i>-Two. One.</i>

272
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,283
Quick!

273
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,122
<i>The time limit for this room</i>

274
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,989
<i>is one minute and fifty seconds.</i>

275
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,957
She really died.

276
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,342
What the hell is this?

277
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,050
You were the one who killed that girl.

278
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,970
But we survived because of me, right?

279
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:07,473
What?

280
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,380
Go on. Hit me.

281
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,137
If you guys keep spacing out,
you'll die too.

282
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,022
Damn it!

283
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,978
Do we choose "Die" here, too?

284
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,611
Since the last one was "Die,"
the next one should be "Live."

285
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,355
Yes. It can't be "Die" twice in a row.

286
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,031
-But it's hard to choose "Die."
-I see.

287
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,490
I'm sure that this is a game for us
to choose a sacrifice

288
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,701
within the time limit.

289
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,661
Sacrifice?

290
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,740
There's probably no meaning to the doors.

291
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,485
What's important is
who's going to open it.

292
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,957
They're telling us to choose one person
within the time limit.

293
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,365
You sacrificed that girl just now.

294
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,629
Why don't you open the door next?

295
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:44,499
I believe if I were to survive,
it'll be for the good of all mankind.

296
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,377
Don't you feel bad talking about that?

297
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,551
<i>One minute remaining.</i>

298
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,064
No one's going to open the doors
at this rate.

299
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,349
Everyone's going to die
from the fire when the time is up!

300
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,893
Then why don't you open it?

301
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,808
Why ask someone to open it?
Do it yourself!

302
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,436
You also want to let someone else do it!

303
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,414
I'll open it.

304
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,084
Arisu!

305
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:18,825
LIVE

306
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,246
DIE

307
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,504
Stop, Arisu. Don't be provoked by her!

308
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,008
I'll open the door, damn it!

309
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,096
<i>Thirty seconds remaining.</i>

310
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,488
Arisu!

311
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,286
See?

312
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:06,293
You can't open it.
Even you would have sacrificed that girl!

313
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,627
Shut the hell up!

314
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,509
<i>Twenty seconds remaining.</i>

315
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,301
I'll do it.

316
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,893
He's got bad luck anyway.

317
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,138
-Karube!
-But we'll take turns!

318
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,432
You'll be next after me.

319
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,690
<i>Ten seconds remaining.</i>

320
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,151
Karube.

321
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:29,571
Karube!

322
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,951
<i>-Five, Four. Three.</i>
-Karube!

323
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,661
-<i>Two. One.</i>
-Hurry up!

324
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,661
<i>The time limit for this room</i>

325
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,827
<i>is one minute and forty seconds.</i>

326
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,551
-The time limit is shortening each time.
-I can't do this anymore.

327
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,919
We're taking turns.

328
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,966
You open the door next.

329
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,888
-I'll choose the door to open.
-Wait.

330
00:34:58,471 --> 00:34:59,391
"Live."

331
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,176
Open it!

332
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,480
No.

333
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,280
Do you have any ideas, Arisu?

334
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:12,898
Ideas?

335
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:16,065
You always say that there's a solution
in every game, right?

336
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,572
-This isn't a game.
-You must know what to do!

337
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,828
You've always solved
puzzle games that I could never do.

338
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,791
-So do it!
-This is not a game, Karube.

339
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,289
It's all about luck here.

340
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,504
-Think, Arisu!
-<i>One minute remaining.</i>

341
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,416
There might have been a hint somewhere.

342
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,883
First, we went into this building.

343
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,176
Stop it already!

344
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,429
-Then, the elevator took us--
-I can't do this!

345
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,931
Don't give up, Arisu! We can't reset!

346
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:42,353
It's impossible, I'm telling you!

347
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,561
-I can't do this anymore.
-I'm telling you to think!

348
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,732
I've been working my ass off,
while you were just playing games!

349
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,312
What does that have to do with this?

350
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,817
You only know how to beat people up.
What makes you so big?

351
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,029
Well, I'm sorry about that!

352
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,400
Just stop that!

353
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,655
GM BUILDING

354
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,039
Wait a minute.

355
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:05,957
What's the matter, Arisu?

356
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,712
<i>Thirty seconds remaining.</i>

357
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,255
BMW 523d.

358
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,264
It was a BMW 523d.

359
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,056
So?

360
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,020
The answer is "Die."

361
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,733
-How do you know that?
<i>-Ten seconds remaining.</i>

362
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:33,765
There's no time!

363
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,612
I'll open the door.

364
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:38,493
Arisu! Are you sure the answer is "Die"?

365
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,411
-Please...
<i>-Fiv</i>e...

366
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,831
<i>-Three. Two. One.</i>
-This means it's correct, right?

367
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,745
<i>The time limit for this room</i>
<i>is one minute and thirty seconds.</i>

368
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,593
What's going on?

369
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:53,958
Do you know which it is now?

370
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:58,174
The length of a BMW 523d
is 4 meters and 94 centimeters.

371
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,797
There was one parked outside here.

372
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,719
<i>The length of the building</i>
<i>is equivalent to four of those cars.</i>

373
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:08,476
This means that this building
is approximately 20 meters in length.

374
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,861
My feet are 28 centimeters long.

375
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,359
One, two, three...

376
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,150
It should be around six meters.

377
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:21,776
According to the evacuation map,

378
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,824
the elevator is at the corner
of the building.

379
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,615
<i>The shape of the building is square.</i>

380
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,206
<i>These rooms are all square-shaped too.</i>

381
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,915
Assuming that one side
of the building is 20 meters,

382
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:38,212
and the rooms are 6 square meter in size,
there can only be three rooms on one side.

383
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:41,007
-<i>One minute remaining.</i>
-Is there something I can write on?

384
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,432
Here you go.

385
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,969
Inside a square building,

386
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,306
assuming that each room is square,

387
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,022
this floor should have nine rooms.

388
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,062
-It's just like a puzzle game.
-It's Arisu's forte!

389
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,606
We started in this room.

390
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:59,437
The high-school girl died in this room.
This is the next room.

391
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,319
Thanks to Karube, we moved forward.

392
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,115
This means that the door to the right
cannot be accessed.

393
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,909
Then I opened the door to this room.

394
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,004
<i>Twenty seconds remaining.</i>

395
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,748
Through the process of elimination,
these two rooms are a no-go.

396
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,325
I'm sure of it.

397
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,666
<i>Ten seconds remaining.</i>

398
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,040
The answer is "Die"!
The "Live" door is a trap!

399
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:21,258
<i>Four. Three. Two. One.</i>

400
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:28,183
<i>The time limit for this room</i>
<i>is one minute and twenty seconds.</i>

401
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,184
If your reasoning works,
we'll be able to survive!

402
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,806
You're awesome, Arisu!

403
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,095
This game is not based on luck.
We can clear it together!

404
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,230
According to my drawing,
the next is "Die" too.

405
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,191
All right!

406
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,526
Ready?

407
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,780
Come on!

408
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,659
All right!

409
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,195
<i>The time limit for this room...</i>

410
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,157
What's next?

411
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,076
...<i>is one minute and ten seconds.</i>

412
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,035
It's "Live."

413
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,468
All right.

414
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:04,836
Hey!

415
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:07,801
Hey, it hurts!

416
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:11,394
<i>The time limit for this room</i>
<i>is one minute.</i>

417
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,058
There's no door in the front.

418
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,273
All right!

419
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,194
-That hurts!
-Take this!

420
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:20,478
What's next?

421
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,117
Since the right door
is out of the question,

422
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,701
should we choose one on the outer wall?

423
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,250
Wait!

424
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,960
I might have missed something.

425
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,292
<i>Fifty seconds remaining.</i>

426
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,628
<i>The room that we are currently in</i>

427
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,134
<i>is in the back-left corner</i>
<i>of the building.</i>

428
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,514
<i>The clear condition</i>
<i>is to leave this building.</i>

429
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,721
<i>We're compelled to choose</i>
<i>the "Die" door, which leads us out.</i>

430
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:56,057
<i>But if I recall, there is no gap</i>
<i>between this and the neighboring building.</i>

431
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:59,273
<i>The "Live" door leads us</i>
<i>to where the high-school girl died.</i>

432
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:02,185
<i>Why isn't there a door</i>
<i>to the rear of the building?</i>

433
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,947
<i>I must have overlooked something.</i>
<i>What could that be?</i>

434
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:10,159
<i>There's no space for any tricks</i>
<i>in the rooms we've come through.</i>

435
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,201
<i>If that's the case...</i>

436
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,285
There's no time to waste! We'll die!

437
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:21,464
-You didn't even open the door!
-You were the one who pushed it onto me!

438
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,554
Give me a break!

439
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:23,917
A video.

440
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:24,964
Wait.

441
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,167
Chota!
You took a video in the first room, right?

442
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,928
We have no time for that!

443
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:30,722
<i>Thirty seconds remaining.</i>

444
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,103
I might have missed something.

445
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,429
<i>...some kind of event.</i>

446
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:35,773
<i>Which do you think it is?</i>

447
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,313
<i>Hey, look down!</i>

448
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,516
<i>...will happen if the time is up?</i>

449
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,856
<i>I can't stand it anymore!</i>

450
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,119
There's no door!

451
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,367
There's no door in the room
the girl entered!

452
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,041
-So what?
-There's a door here!

453
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,449
-<i>Ten seconds.</i>
-This means...

454
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,833
The room where the girl died isn't square!

455
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:01,924
-Then this door...
-There's another room behind that door!<i> </i>

456
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,921
<i>Four. Three.</i>

457
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,213
<i>Two. One.</i>

458
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,470
<i>The time limit for this room</i>
<i>is ten seconds.</i>

459
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,142
Ten seconds?

460
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,431
Are you kidding me?

461
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,314
It's not "Live." It's "Die"!

462
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,101
Don't be tricked by the question!

463
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,645
<i>Five. Four.</i>

464
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,769
-Hurry up!
<i>-Three. Two. One.</i>

465
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,873
Head downstairs!

466
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,159
Hang in there!

467
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,217
GAME CLEAR

468
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,515
<i>Congratulations.</i>

469
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,349
It's all thanks to you guys.

470
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,571
Thank you.

471
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,704
This must be retribution.

472
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:04,036
<i>To the survivors of the game,</i>
<i>we will now supply you with a visa.</i>

473
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:07,253
{\an8}WE WILL SUPPLY ALL GAME SURVIVORS
WITH A THREE-DAY VISA

474
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,419
Visa?

475
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,854
I'm going to... drop out of the game!

476
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:30,568
You guys.

477
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,400
There's no end to this game,
no matter how much you clear.

478
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,452
My visa ends today.

479
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,288
Finally...

480
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,963
This is the end.

481
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:57,007
GM BUILDING

482
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,745
When it's a new day,

483
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,541
you'll die if your visa expires by then.

484
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,247
Our visas will end too.

485
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,337
Three more days.

486
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:36,547
If you don't want to die,

487
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,591
you'll have to keep playing the games.

488
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:36,022
