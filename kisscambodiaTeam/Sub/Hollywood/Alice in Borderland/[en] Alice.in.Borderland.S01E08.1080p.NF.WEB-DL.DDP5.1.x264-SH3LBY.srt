1
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:23,357
<i>-Oh, it worked.</i>
<i>-What?</i>

2
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,860
<i>Is that your phone, Asahi?</i>

3
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,451
<i>No, it's the one I picked up.</i>

4
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,164
<i>Is it recording?</i>

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,070
<i>Yes.</i>

6
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,792
<i>I think the camera is working.</i>

7
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,311
<i>Let's see.</i>

8
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,401
<i>There's no one in this town.</i>

9
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,324
<i>Everyone in Tokyo disappeared.</i>

10
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,281
<i>We're in Harajuku, yet there's no one.</i>

11
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:17,991
<i>Yes.</i>

12
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,171
<i>What's going on?</i>

13
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,345
<i>It's been five days</i>

14
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,520
<i>since everyone disappeared.</i>

15
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,518
<i>You're taking a video again?</i>
<i>What are you going to do with it?</i>

16
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,105
<i>To leave a record.</i>

17
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,355
<i>And why would you want to do that?</i>

18
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,942
<i>Someone might see it.</i>

19
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,485
<i>After that,</i>

20
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,083
<i>we met a certain person.</i>

21
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:04,575
<i>Then we were brought to that place,</i>

22
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,501
<i>and we work there now</i>

23
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,759
<i>Here?</i>

24
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,607
<i>Are you really going in?</i>

25
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,999
<i>It's pitch black!</i>

26
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,245
<i>Momoka?</i>

27
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,377
<i>Momoka?</i>

28
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,721
<i>Momoka!</i>

29
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,730
<i>Time remaining, 15 minutes.</i>

30
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,202
Kill them all.

31
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,167
Jun...

32
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,378
I can't do this anymore.

33
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,303
We've gone too far to stop.

34
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,005
There's no way we can return
to our original lives

35
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,216
after killing so many people.

36
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,023
You heard me, right?

37
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,273
Anyone who goes against me is a witch.

38
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,530
Please shoot me!

39
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,528
Stop it already!

40
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,581
Let's end this game.

41
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:38,884
I...

42
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,470
I was confined by you guys

43
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,974
the entire time,
even when the murder occurred.

44
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,845
I'm sure you know

45
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,433
I couldn't have been the witch.

46
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,817
If you aren't the witch,
then there's no need to kill me.

47
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:02,106
Please cooperate with me
and search for the witch!

48
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,459
Arisu!

49
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,174
Stop it!

50
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,423
Hey!

51
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,837
Now I know.

52
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,835
The reason why you attacked Arisu,

53
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,598
even though
he's the only one with an alibi.

54
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,770
That's because you're the witch!

55
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,019
Arisu!

56
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:44,701
You...

57
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,361
Are you the witch?

58
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,422
Yes. I'm the witch.

59
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:19,856
Shoot me.

60
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,732
Do it!

61
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:33,244
-Shoot him!
-Aguni is not the witch!

62
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,076
This is a Ten of Hearts game!

63
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,955
A game that toys with people's feelings!

64
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:44,461
It's not a game
where you win by killing Aguni!

65
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,433
You're not the witch.

66
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,600
So why?

67
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,943
That's because you have another motive.

68
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,060
Another motive?

69
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,652
The one you killed

70
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,697
was not Momoka.

71
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,407
It was Hatter.

72
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,124
What?

73
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,422
I found out after I saw your eyes.

74
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,958
It was as if you had given up all hope.

75
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,592
Those eyes.
It was the same as mine that day.

76
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,973
Those eyes after I killed my friends.

77
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,846
You're not dumb.

78
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,185
Yet you wanted to kill everyone
right from the start.

79
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,478
That's not like you!

80
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,950
You must have had another motive in mind.

81
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,120
Ever since I came to the Beach,
I thought it was strange.

82
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,826
If you had these many firearms,

83
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,335
the militants would have gained control
over the Beach a long time ago.

84
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,127
Yet that didn't happen until now.

85
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:10,837
In reality,

86
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,296
you were not in conflict
with Hatter at all.

87
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,893
Didn't you both actually help each other?

88
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,476
You wanted to make sure

89
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,062
that dangerous people like Niragi
don't go on a rampage.

90
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,229
You tried to hold them back.

91
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,662
You...

92
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:44,668
Weren't you and Hatter
best friends in reality?

93
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,585
Then, why did you kill him?

94
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,218
For some reason,

95
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,886
you couldn't forgive Hatter
for what he did.

96
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,938
You wanted
to stop Hatter and his crazy ways.

97
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,737
You wanted your best friend
to regain his senses.

98
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,477
Will it continue?

99
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,652
Those games.

100
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:51,858
I...

101
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,070
will create a utopia here.

102
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,908
For those who have fallen into despair,

103
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,873
if we don't have hope,

104
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,416
we just need to make one!

105
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,295
This will be the land of hope.

106
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,264
That's impossible.

107
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,545
No.

108
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,980
We can do it.

109
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,441
Everyone here

110
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,992
is now one!

111
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:42,031
We shall unite and gather all cards,

112
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,037
and return to the original world together!

113
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:58,681
These guys.

114
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,466
They dared
to hide their playing cards from me.

115
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,950
Aguni.

116
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,498
As of today,

117
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:38,007
I will create a third rule.

118
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,187
"Death to the traitors."

119
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,860
What would you know?

120
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,372
Stop it!

121
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,756
What would you...

122
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,931
THIS WAY TO THE GAME ARENA

123
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:39,744
This way.

124
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,209
<i>Congratulations</i>.

125
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,890
How nostalgic.

126
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,439
This place looks exactly
the same as before.

127
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,730
I'm...

128
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,148
at my limit.

129
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,906
It's getting harder
to control Niragi and the militants.

130
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,461
Let's end the Beach.

131
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,304
End it?

132
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,506
All the members of the Beach

133
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,060
are immersed in the happiness
they found there, aren't they?

134
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,059
Returning to the original world
after we gathered all the cards

135
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,772
was just a big lie you came up with!

136
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,565
Let's end this.

137
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,068
Are you going to betray me?

138
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,497
"Death to the traitors."

139
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,877
The rules of the Beach are absolute.

140
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,421
There's no meaning to the Beach!

141
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,634
Let's stop this already.

142
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,893
We need to aim towards hope!

143
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,391
Stop talking like that!

144
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,305
Just where is the hope within the Beach?

145
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,187
A world like this,

146
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,815
where is the hope?

147
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,247
In the past,

148
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,209
I had trusted friends alongside me.

149
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,875
My hope in them...

150
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,433
was enough for me.

151
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,364
For a king...

152
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:35,542
There are times where
we have to make difficult decisions.

153
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:45,165
What a pity, Mori.

154
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,608
I was also someone who killed my friends.

155
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,947
I understand the pain in your eyes.

156
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,002
You killed your friend.

157
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,251
And so you wanted
to kill everyone at the Beach,

158
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:27,214
because they were the ones
who made your friend go crazy.

159
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:34,892
Your broken feelings.
The game master made use of them!

160
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:40,428
-That's why this is a Hearts game!
-Shut up!

161
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,810
Arisu!

162
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:49,649
If that's true, then Aguni just wanted
to kill everyone regardless of the game?

163
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,112
You're joking.

164
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,621
And we went along with that?

165
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,040
Just who is the witch?

166
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,628
I know who it is.

167
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,341
The identity of the real witch.

168
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:19,305
You can always see the game master's
characteristics in a game.

169
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,389
In a Hearts game,

170
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,306
it always makes a fool out of everyone.

171
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,727
NATURAL BOTANICAL GARDEN

172
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,566
<i>Difficulty, Seven of Hearts.</i>

173
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,362
A game of betrayal
where you play with people's hearts.

174
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,356
Everyone!

175
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,200
The one that needs to hide is the wolf!

176
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,502
Maybe...

177
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,996
there really was a way to end the game

178
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,712
without killing everyone.

179
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,299
A solution

180
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,722
where no one has to die.

181
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,064
But that's impossible.

182
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,395
We have to hunt down the witch

183
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,730
and burn them
in the Fire of Judgment, right?

184
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:12,935
No.

185
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,829
There's a witch candidate

186
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,794
that makes it possible.

187
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,205
It is possible...

188
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,723
if the witch is Momoka herself.

189
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:54,443
Momoka struck the knife into herself?

190
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:56,741
Yes.

191
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,067
If I were the game master,

192
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,583
I would come up with this idea.

193
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,335
What a joke.

194
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,173
I'm the witch!

195
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,300
You guys want to kill me, right?

196
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,859
Aguni is trying
to take everyone down with him!

197
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,038
Hey, Takeru.

198
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,456
Takeru.

199
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,804
Takeru.

200
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,419
Takeru!

201
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,517
The Beach made him crazy.

202
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,694
You guys made him crazy!

203
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,278
I'm the witch!

204
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,164
I know how to stop Aguni!

205
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,872
I'll get Aguni's attention.

206
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,995
Use the chance
to burn Momoka in the Fire of Judgment!

207
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:16,841
Arisu.

208
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,052
End this meaningless massacre.

209
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,511
Asahi!

210
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,682
Listen up, everyone!

211
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:38,481
I'm the dealer of this game.

212
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,216
It was a reverse grip.

213
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:20,772
Fingerprints with a reverse grip
were found on the knife.

214
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
<i>This means</i>

215
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,122
<i>Momoka grabbed the knife herself</i>

216
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,292
<i>and stabbed it through her own chest.</i>

217
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,177
She's the witch.

218
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,604
Why would she...

219
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,561
kill herself for a game?

220
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,732
Was Momoka really the game master?

221
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,284
That girl also said she's the dealer.

222
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,947
So were we just being toyed with by them?

223
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,539
But she's human, just like the rest of us.

224
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,463
Ordinary humans...

225
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,793
The two of them...

226
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:26,917
They might have been
controlled by someone else too.

227
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:34,813
Aguni.

228
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:39,728
Let's just stop this.

229
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:46,111
Don't let the deaths
of the innocents go to waste.

230
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:54,405
I understand
how it feels to kill your friends.

231
00:24:55,744 --> 00:25:00,584
But we shouldn't take out our frustration
on those who are still alive!

232
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,843
We are still alive!

233
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,224
We're all facing despair head-on

234
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:12,049
and fighting until the very end!

235
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,851
Don't look down on those
who are still alive!

236
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,299
The fire is spreading!

237
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,264
Run!

238
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,984
-Move the body to the Fire of Judgment!
-Hurry up!

239
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,153
That hurt.

240
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,155
In the first place,

241
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:28,343
I should have just burned down the Beach
with the Fire of Judgment.

242
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,126
Niragi...

243
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,303
Niragi?

244
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,972
With this, I'll clear the game!

245
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,401
You guys...

246
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,065
I'll kill all of you!

247
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,263
Aguni.

248
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,522
<i>Three minutes remaining.</i>

249
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,440
There's no time!

250
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,614
You grab her legs.

251
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,995
-Get out!
-Hurry up!

252
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,971
<i>Congratulations.</i>

253
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,974
GAME CLEARED
CONGRATULATIONS

254
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:38,743
<i>There is no place</i>
<i>where we'll always be safe in this world.</i>

255
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,328
<i>The North Pole, which the explorer saw,</i>

256
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,036
<i>was the true form of the world</i>

257
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,245
<i>without the illusions of civilization.</i>

258
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:58,209
<i>When all is done,</i>
<i>you simply return to the soil.</i>

259
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:02,838
<i>This land</i>

260
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,465
<i>is the true form of the world.</i>

261
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,137
<i>I'm thankful to this place.</i>

262
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,439
<i>Now...</i>

263
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,318
<i>I'm freer than I ever was.</i>

264
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,546
I guess this is the end of our paradise.

265
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,354
Everyone died.

266
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,380
Those guys.

267
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,547
I can't forgive them.

268
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,046
Let go!

269
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:25,472
You can't.

270
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,966
They killed all our comrades!

271
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,057
I won't forgive them!

272
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,538
Let's stop this.

273
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,804
We're still alive.

274
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,129
That's all that matters now.

275
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,102
That's all.

276
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,142
Arisu?

277
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,104
Arisu!

278
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,075
I got it.

279
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,630
I got it.

280
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,553
Arisu...

281
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,010
You're quite persistent too.

282
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,942
I started to think that it's pointless
to collect all the playing cards.

283
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:42,734
Say what?

284
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,689
But with this,

285
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,736
we've got everything
except for the face cards.

286
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:56,867
But I wonder what the management team
of the game wants us to see?

287
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,507
<i>-Is it recording?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

288
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,720
<i>I think the camera is working.</i>

289
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,272
What's this?

290
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,021
It's a video that Asahi left behind.

291
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,111
<i>Let's see...</i>

292
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,360
<i>There's no one in this town.</i>

293
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,987
<i>Everyone in Tokyo disappeared.</i>

294
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,990
<i>After that,</i>

295
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,912
<i>we met a certain person.</i>

296
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:46,794
<i>Then we were brought to that place,</i>

297
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,803
<i>and we work there now.</i>

298
00:34:56,094 --> 00:35:00,354
<i>We help with setting up the games.</i>

299
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,266
<i>Are you really going in?</i>

300
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:20,156
<i>People known as dealers help</i>
<i>to facilitate the games.</i>

301
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:28,838
<i>Sometimes we join games to act as taggers,</i>

302
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:33,756
<i>or we act as players</i>
<i>to confuse other players</i>

303
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,180
<i>or to help prepare the game.</i>

304
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,180
<i>But during the games,</i>
<i>we're also being monitored,</i>

305
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:46,854
<i>and we'll be killed</i>
<i>if we reveal that we're dealers.</i>

306
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,820
<i>Are you recording again?</i>
<i>What are you going to do if they find out?</i>

307
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:17,088
RISK OF ELECTRIC SHOCK

308
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,597
Is this the dealers' base?

309
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,646
<i>Stop!</i>

310
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,526
<i>Place your bets!</i>

311
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,493
<i>I got a ten-day visa!</i>

312
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,094
<i>Just hurry up already!</i>

313
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,266
DEALER WINS

314
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,444
This is...

315
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,403
So they are the game masters.

316
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:11,706
<i>Many people have died.</i>

317
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,587
<i>There was a girl</i>
<i>who was around the same age as us.</i>

318
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:24,222
<i>We prepared the game</i>
<i>according to how our superiors wanted,</i>

319
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,552
<i>then we joined the games</i>

320
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,473
<i>and made it so that the players die.</i>

321
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,056
<i>Because of us,</i>

322
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,864
<i>many people die every day.</i>

323
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,816
<i>I can't take this anymore.</i>

324
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:49,874
<i>We kill people,</i>
<i>win games, and earn visa days.</i>

325
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,043
<i>We get to live for another two weeks,</i>

326
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,916
<i>but I don't even know</i>
<i>how many people we had to kill for that.</i>

327
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,670
<i>I can't take it anymore.</i>

328
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:06,724
<i>Momoka.</i>

329
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:11,471
<i>This is all a dream.</i>

330
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,350
<i>It's all right.</i>

331
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,154
<i>We will wake up from this dream soon.</i>

332
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,575
<i>I want to end everything...</i>

333
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,071
This is the place.

334
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:44,821
There it is.

335
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:56,865
RISK OF ELECTRIC SHOCK

336
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:02,199
Are you serious?

337
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,054
You actually found this place.

338
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,305
As expected
from someone I have high hopes for.

339
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,020
We meet again.

340
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,073
You guys.

341
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:38,115
Thanks to you guys, I have
all the numbered playing cards with me.

342
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,201
Thank you.

343
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,039
How did you discover this place?

344
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,671
It took me some time to realize
that this is actually

345
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,047
the route map of a subway station.

346
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,732
What happens
when we collect all the playing cards?

347
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:15,073
I thought I would know the answer
after I came here.

348
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:19,202
But there's only one thing I discovered.

349
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,831
They are not game masters.

350
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,116
Right.

351
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:30,832
Judging from the fact that
they were all killed after our victory.

352
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,422
They're humans like us,
and on top of that,

353
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:37,593
there's someone above them.

354
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:47,894
Just who could they be?

355
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,350
Who knows?

356
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:52,939
They might be aliens.

357
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:56,691
Or even God himself.

358
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:08,121
SPECIAL URGENT BROADCAST

359
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:15,422
<i>Congratulations to all players.</i>

360
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,263
What?

361
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:22,797
Interesting.

362
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:27,852
Mira.

363
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,189
<i>With the exception of the face card games,</i>

364
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:35,435
<i>all of you have cleared</i>
<i>all the numbered games thus far</i>

365
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,784
<i>and emerged the victors.</i>

366
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,612
<i>A sweet victory you've grasped</i>

367
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:44,117
<i>by sacrificing numerous lives.</i>

368
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:54,383
<i>I wonder how many</i>
<i>of your comrades have died?</i>

369
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,008
<i>Try remembering...</i>

370
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,509
<i>those that were shot dead with a gun.</i>

371
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,731
<i>That girl you burned alive.</i>

372
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:20,320
<i>Those struck with the lasers</i>
<i>and those that drowned.</i>

373
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,947
<i>Those whose heads were blown off.</i>

374
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,199
<i>Those comrades of yours.</i>

375
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,294
<i>The despair you've felt so far</i>

376
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:39,206
<i>and those dying moments</i>
<i>that you can never forget.</i>

377
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:46,046
<i>I'm extremely touched!</i>

378
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:54,104
<i>All of you players,</i>

379
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:59,609
<i>we would like to give you a present.</i>

380
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,364
Are you returning us
to the original world?

381
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,371
<i>There will be new games!</i>

382
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:11,745
<i>Let's play games together.</i>

383
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,999
<i>You'll fight for face cards!</i>

384
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,455
New games?

385
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,633
I don't dislike the idea.

386
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:26,012
<i>We've still got many more</i>
<i>wonderful games prepared for all of you,</i>

387
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,220
<i>so look forward to it!</i>

388
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,971
This woman.

389
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,311
Is she the game master?

390
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:38,274
I'd rather see an alien
appear on the screen.

391
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:44,895
<i>The next stage will commence</i>
<i>tomorrow at noon.</i>

392
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:50,488
<i>Let's have some fun together!</i>

393
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,952
So we have to fight again.

394
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,369
Yes.

395
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,838
But one thing is different.

396
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,723
We're finally seeing our target.

397
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,427
We'll definitely find our answers there.

398
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:58,949
