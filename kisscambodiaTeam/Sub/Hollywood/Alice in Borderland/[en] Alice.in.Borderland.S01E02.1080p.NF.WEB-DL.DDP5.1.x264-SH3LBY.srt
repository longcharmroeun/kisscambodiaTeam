1
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,132
You're letting your guard down!

2
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,257
Yuzuha!

3
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,109
Father.

4
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,464
I will survive!

5
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,619
What?

6
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,033
<i>How was it?</i>

7
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,700
<i>No good. I can't find any leads.</i>

8
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,610
<i>In any case,</i>

9
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,704
<i>let's gather anything that we can use.</i>

10
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:17,215
FURNITURE AND INTERIOR GOODS FLOOR

11
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,468
I knew it. It's no good.

12
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,759
All the IC chips have been destroyed.

13
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,266
Video cameras, digital clocks.

14
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,098
Anything that operates
via an electronic circuit board

15
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,894
won't function at all.

16
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,321
But things like this still work, huh?

17
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,649
Since they don't have IC chips installed.

18
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,071
What does that mean?

19
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,704
Maybe...

20
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,195
-Hurry up!
-Look, fireworks!

21
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,708
It might have been
an electromagnetic pulse attack.

22
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,473
I've read about this on the Internet.

23
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,509
When fired into the stratosphere,

24
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:05,642
it's a weapon capable of destroying
the electronics in an entire city.

25
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,021
Seriously?

26
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,364
So why is this still operating?

27
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:19,985
I have no idea.

28
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,405
VISA
RYOHEI ARISU

29
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,409
REMAINING DAYS: 3

30
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,241
What?

31
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,126
It's useless if we can't charge it, huh?

32
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,774
This area looks safe.

33
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,862
All right.
This will serve as a decent weapon.

34
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,530
What are you going to fight against?

35
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,491
Zombies?

36
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,833
You can't use electricity
and gas either, right?

37
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,245
But I can still use the portable stove.

38
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,634
Batteries work.
So we can use flashlights, too.

39
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,461
Don't you feel like eating something warm?

40
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,568
I feel alive again!

41
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,531
Nice and hot!

42
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,867
We haven't eaten anything since yesterday.

43
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,210
What were the three of you doing?

44
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,711
When everyone disappeared, I mean.

45
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,090
We were in a restroom.

46
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,420
We were talking in the same cubicle.

47
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,837
I don't really understand what's going on.

48
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,337
What about you?

49
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,346
Saori...

50
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,028
Work.

51
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,372
I was inside the meeting room
organizing the work materials.

52
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:33,702
And then everyone disappeared
from the office.

53
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,422
Did you see or hear anything?

54
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:57,771
Chief?

55
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,832
I don't remember.

56
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,540
I arrived at this place three days ago,

57
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,170
and I was made to join the game
out of nowhere, like everyone else.

58
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,377
Everyone died, except for me.

59
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,803
You used them all as bait?

60
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:33,887
Say whatever you want.

61
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,305
I just...

62
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,393
I just wanted to survive.

63
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,911
Well...

64
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,833
What game was it?

65
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,746
I was at a subway station.

66
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,835
It was a game where they used poison gas.

67
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,099
Everyone was vomiting blood.

68
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,474
Blood was even flowing out of their eyes.

69
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,306
Isn't it strange?

70
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,108
When everyone disappeared
from this world.

71
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,902
It was yesterday
for the three of us, right?

72
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:30,986
Yes.

73
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,660
But it was three days ago for Shibuki.

74
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,239
Why at different times?

75
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:35,831
You're right.

76
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,195
And even the vegetables were rotten.

77
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,041
It was only a few days
since everyone disappeared.

78
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,166
What could be the reason?

79
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,036
Maybe the way time passes

80
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,047
is different from normal?

81
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,585
What?

82
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,132
I don't really know,

83
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:57,013
but even among us,

84
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:01,266
the time when people disappeared
is different, right?

85
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,903
Did we time travel
while we were in the restroom?

86
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,482
That's impossible.

87
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,437
But it's also impossible
for people to disappear.

88
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,737
Time traveling does not exist.

89
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
How do you explain the game
and people disappearing?

90
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,065
Don't ask me that.

91
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,027
In any case,

92
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,164
One thing we know for sure about this game

93
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,619
is that there's a game master.

94
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,420
Game master?

95
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,878
Someone came up with this game.

96
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,801
That I'm sure of.

97
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,759
While we were in the restroom,

98
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,181
they moved the people in Tokyo away

99
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,720
and prepared for this game?

100
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,263
Then they ascertained our movements

101
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,845
<i>and fired lasers</i>
<i>on people's heads when it was time.</i>

102
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,685
Can a human really do all that?

103
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,233
I'm sure it's possible if they inserted

104
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,737
a highly accurate
GPS microchip into our bodies.

105
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,660
Now you're talking like an IT technician!

106
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,446
But who could be behind that?

107
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:06,002
Could it be the federal
or state government or something?

108
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,844
I've heard some rumors in my company.

109
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,589
An IT corporation from Europe
wants to conduct an experiment,

110
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,474
where within a VR space,

111
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,680
they attempt to create a world
completely identical to the real world.

112
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,727
But we should be able to distinguish
VR from the real world.

113
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,564
It hurts.

114
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,400
I don't think
VR can cause burns like that.

115
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,241
It must be God.

116
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,485
This must be the work of God.

117
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,704
Otherwise, it's impossible
to explain what's happening.

118
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,787
Don't be stupid.

119
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:49,294
So God really exists.

120
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,298
Hey, is your injury getting worse?

121
00:11:58,592 --> 00:11:59,432
It's all right.

122
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:00,967
It's going to be fine.

123
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,904
I think Chota needs to see a doctor.

124
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,652
Given his personality,

125
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,146
he must be enduring the pain.

126
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:18,653
But he's at his limit.

127
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,370
Arisu.

128
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:28,826
Let's join the game tomorrow night,
just the two of us.

129
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:30,575
What?

130
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,705
We still have three days
left on our visas.

131
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,798
It's better to get used to the game
while we still have time to spare.

132
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,759
We'll probably have to

133
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:45,564
beat the next game
with Chota's injured leg.

134
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:53,983
Are you all right?

135
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,112
Thank you very much.

136
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,068
<i>If we don't learn how to clear the games</i>
<i>with just the two of us,</i>

137
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,161
<i>we won't be able to protect Chota.</i>

138
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,116
<i>You're right, but...</i>

139
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,156
And we can search for a doctor too.

140
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,462
It's easier to meet people in games.

141
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,418
Do we have to do that again?

142
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,085
There might be a hint
as to what the game is about!

143
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:23,933
Well, I guess.

144
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,100
If we join the game,

145
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,970
we might be able
to find out their signature.

146
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,064
Signature?

147
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,061
If someone actually made this game,

148
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:39,031
we will definitely be able to find out
their characteristics through the games.

149
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,145
If we can discover that,

150
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,945
we might be able to figure out
a strategy for the game.

Where did all the people in Tokyo go?

159
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,652
This thing--

Just what is this?

166
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,826
I ended up here.
I have no idea what's going on.

167
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,841
-It's a game.
-Stop it.

00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,384
Beginners will only get in our way.

169
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,465
It doesn't feel great,

170
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,974
but it might be a good idea
to act like Shibuki did.

171
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:16,557
<i>Difficulty, Five of Spades.</i>

172
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,018
Five of Spades?

173
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:23,901
It's a physical game.

174
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,113
Strength is everything here.

175
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,200
I'm Nitobe. Nice to meet you.

176
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,735
-Each mark has a different meaning?
-Exactly!

177
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,121
The mark on a trump card
signifies the game's genre.

178
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,753
Club refers to a team battle,
and Diamond refers to a battle of wits.

179
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,963
As for Heart...

180
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,132
It's the most troublesome one.

181
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,046
"Troublesome"?

182
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,758
It's a game of betrayal
where you play with people's hearts.

183
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,101
What about the numbers?

184
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,641
The difficulty level.

185
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,558
The larger the number,

186
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:01,854
the harder it is to clear.

187
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,478
<i>Game, "A Game of Tag."</i>

188
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:11,156
<i>Rule. Run away from the tagger.</i>

189
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,740
What?

190
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,738
A Game of Tag?

191
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,161
-Who's the tagger?
-How should I know?

192
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,171
<i>Clear condition.</i>

193
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,377
{\an8}<i>Discover the safezone</i>

194
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,170
{\an8}<i>hidden in one of the building rooms</i>
<i>within the time limit.</i>

195
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,764
{\an8}<i>You clear the game</i>
<i>when this objective is fulfilled.</i>

196
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,760
{\an8}<i>Time limit, 20 minutes.</i>

197
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,393
<i>After 20 minutes has passed,</i>

198
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:39,141
<i>the time bomb hidden</i>
<i>in the building will explode.</i>

199
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,491
TOEI SENDAGAYA APARTMENT

200
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,670
O Holy Mother.

201
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,422
Please save us from our tainted souls.

202
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,796
Our smiles are the light of hope.

203
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,305
The Holy Mother will appear when we smile.

204
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:24,268
O Holy Mother.
Please save us from our tainted souls.

205
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,726
Our smiles are the light of hope.

206
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,862
The Holy Mother will appear when we smile.

207
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,200
So you believe in God.

208
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,123
Here you go.

209
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,996
I've also been doing nothing
but praying recently.

210
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,544
I don't believe in God.

211
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:51,213
But my mom
has always been super religious.

212
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,176
Because of that, I was bullied in school.

213
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,850
But Arisu and Karube saved me.

214
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,676
They are good friends.

215
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,024
Karube is good at fighting
and is popular with the girls,

216
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:12,646
while Arisu is clever
and comes from a reputable family.

217
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,822
Someone like me,

218
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:18,243
I come from a poor family,
and I don't have anything I'm good at.

219
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:23,249
And now that I'm injured,
I have to rely on everyone else again.

220
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:29,997
Humans like it
when someone weaker follows them

221
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,504
because it makes them feel at ease.

222
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,419
But not them.

223
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,217
Do you think you'll be able to
join the next game with them?

224
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:42,933
Your leg is injured, you know?

225
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,810
They are different.

226
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,895
Then will you die for your friends' sake?

227
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,704
<i>Two minutes until the game starts.</i>

228
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,790
Stop following us.

229
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,252
I'm trying to gauge you guys.

230
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,582
Maybe both of you are suitable
to be my allies.

231
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,497
What a joke.

232
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,382
-Are you a doctor?
-No, I'm a real estate agent.

233
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,877
How many times have you played the game?

234
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,545
Let's see, maybe five times?

235
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,505
And you've always won?

236
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,545
Well, I guess.

237
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,231
Where should I go?

238
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,678
I don't know!

239
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,555
You can only rely on yourself.

240
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,623
If you can choose
your starting position,

241
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,958
this is the perfect location.

242
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,555
What?

243
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,772
That's nasty.

244
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,855
Let's see...

245
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,566
Everyone looks like
they're about to die, as usual.

246
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:27,235
I guess you've always been
betrayed by people, Shibuki.

247
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,447
You've never met anyone decent.

248
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,370
That's right.

249
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,128
The same goes for you, right, Chota?

250
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,806
O Holy Mother...

251
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,468
Please save us

252
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,891
from our tainted souls.

253
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,225
You're wrong.

254
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,209
It must have been tough for you.

255
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,614
<i>The game will now commence.</i>

256
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,359
<i>The time limit is 20 minutes.</i>

257
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,909
<i>Game start.</i>

258
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,004
<i>The tagger is on the move.</i>

259
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,450
Anyway, let's just search
for an unlocked door.

260
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,673
We won't make it if we dawdle like this!

261
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,557
<i>Three minutes have passed.</i>

262
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,412
What was that sound?

263
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,320
He's dead.

264
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,601
Arisu!

265
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,599
-Run!
-Go!

266
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,388
-Arisu!
-Run!

267
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:45,897
-Down!
-Hurry up!

268
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,645
Hurry up!

269
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,242
-Move aside!
-What's with you?

270
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,150
Hey!

271
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,283
-Arisu, hurry!
-Karube, wait!

272
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:19,761
<i>Chota,</i>

273
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,217
<i>I can trust you, right?</i>

274
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,370
When it happened,

275
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,868
I was actually having sex
with my superior.

276
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,503
I hated him.

277
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,785
Didn't you say you were working?

278
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,882
They are not even my allies.

279
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,761
Why do I need to tell them the truth?

280
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,624
Since we're both the same,

281
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:22,826
we should get along.

282
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,562
In order to live...

283
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:02,991
This is impossible.

284
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,374
This is crazy. I can't do this!

285
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,832
Hurry up, Mai!

286
00:29:58,838 --> 00:29:59,708
Mai!

287
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:02,878
Aya.

288
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,177
I'll fucking kill you!

289
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,064
Don't come closer!

290
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,323
I told you the truth
because it's you, Chota.

291
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,592
O Holy Mother...

292
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,707
Holy Mother...

293
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,100
The Holy Mother will appear when we smile.

294
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,892
O Holy Mother...

295
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,523
Wait for me, okay?

296
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,937
...from our tainted souls.

297
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,651
Our smiles are the light of hope.

298
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,903
The Holy Mother will appear when we smile.

299
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,702
O Holy Mother,

300
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:10,028
Please save us from our tainted souls.

301
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,328
Please accept this.

302
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,538
Our smiles are the light of hope.

303
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,956
The Holy Mother will appear when we smile.

304
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,495
Very well, this way.

305
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:25,054
O Holy Mother.

306
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,610
-Let's go over there.
-Let's pray together.

307
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,478
O Holy Mother.

308
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,359
Please save us

309
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,244
from our tainted souls.

310
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,287
<i>...from our tainted souls.</i>

311
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:58,288
O Holy Mother.

312
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:02,666
<i>Please.</i>

313
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,883
<i>Save them.</i>

314
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,512
What should we do, Arisu?

315
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,675
Can you come up with any solution?

316
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,564
We can't clear this game
with something like that!

317
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,812
-Just think, Arisu!
-Then you think of one!

318
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,963
The tagger didn't see us.

319
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,250
His field of vision
is narrowed due to the mask!

320
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,628
It's his weak point!

321
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,884
That could be the key!

322
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,144
-Everyone!
-Hey!

323
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,682
The tagger is currently
at the second level of the central area!

324
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:57,806
Stop it. You'll get killed!

325
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:00,192
The tagger has bad vision
because of his mask!

326
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,309
Let's inform each other
of the tagger's location

327
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,357
and search for the safezone together!

328
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,735
It's a good idea,

329
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,406
but no one will respond.

330
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,957
The tagger is moving
from the fourth level of the central area!

331
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,618
Anyone nearby, run!

332
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,382
Really?

333
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,255
-Quick, run away!
-What?

334
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,671
I'm sorry.

335
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,020
A climber?

336
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:38,765
She's pretty good.

337
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,436
{\an8}<i>Eight minutes until the game ends.</i>

338
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:48,898
<i>There are currently seven survivors.</i>

339
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,493
Hey!

340
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,283
Over here! Hey!

341
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,366
Hey!

342
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:43,959
Hey Arisu!

343
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,375
We don't have the time
to help someone else!

344
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,920
Don't just sit there, move!

345
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,837
Hey, move it!

346
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,771
Shall we begin?

347
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,860
Arisu!

348
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,202
You go first!

349
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,243
Damn it.

350
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,581
Let's take the tagger out.

351
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,080
We're going up against a machine gun here!

352
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,252
No, that's a human.

353
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:33,208
The tagger is 190cm tall and weighs 90kg.
Their dominant hand is their right hand.

354
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,377
His shooting is rudimentary.

355
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,216
Most likely
an ex-SDF officer or policeman.

356
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,216
I got it.

357
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:49,814
Take this.

358
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,445
Let's go hunt down the tagger.

359
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,945
Go search for the safezone.

360
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:04,908
What?

361
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:06,618
Hey!

362
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,003
-Don't command us!
-I got it.

363
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,500
I'll search from the top.

364
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:12,881
Arisu!

365
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,759
-Don't do that.
-We don't have any other choice.

366
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,929
I checked the 5th floor on the south block

367
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,889
and the 6th floor on
the east and south blocks.

368
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,813
Let's split up
and search for the safezone.

369
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,926
I haven't checked
the 1st and 2nd floors.

370
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,096
Understood. I'll go check it out.

371
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,154
-Hey!
-Hey!

372
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,815
It's time to get rid of the tagger.

373
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,042
<i>Five minutes remaining.</i>

374
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:48,708
See you later.

375
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:50,794
Okay.

376
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,845
Just where is the safezone?

377
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:17,819
Calm down. Relax and think.

378
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,697
Come on, follow me.

379
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,869
He wields a MAC-10

380
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:33,917
and finishes shooting his 32-round ammo
in 1,5 seconds.

381
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,801
We'll go for him when he's reloading.

382
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,177
I'm over here!

383
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,688
Just come at me. I dare you!

384
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:02,861
Aguni?

385
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,329
Aguni?

386
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,236
Aguni!

387
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,960
You just let him die?

388
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:43,009
Think.

389
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:05,741
Why did he shoot
from such a long distance?

390
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,377
So you realized that too?

391
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,757
Yes. The safezone is in this apartment.

392
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:35,852
Aren't you going to open it?

393
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:38,981
Why did the tagger chase us?

394
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,647
They could have just waited here.

395
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,281
Seems like there's something else
we don't know.

396
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:48,775
However,

397
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,320
if you don't open it...

398
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:59,124
<i>Three minutes until the game concludes.</i>

399
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,128
Look out!

400
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,767
It never hurts to be prepared--

401
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,384
PUSH BOTH BUTTONS
AT ONCE TO CLEAR GAME

402
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,379
Damn it.

403
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,627
Someone, please come over!

404
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:36,643
The safezone is in Apartment 406!

405
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,770
It's impossible to clear the game alone!

406
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:41,428
We need two people to do this!

407
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,141
Seriously?

408
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:45,898
Arisu!

409
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:13,133
This is getting interesting, huh?

410
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:26,154
<i>Time remaining, one minute.</i>

411
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:45,044
Someone!

412
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:46,916
Please come!

413
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,640
<i>Time remaining, thirty seconds.</i>

414
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,617
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

415
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,040
You called?

416
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,297
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

417
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,383
Hey!

418
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,312
<i>Five.</i>

419
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,640
-<i>Four.</i>
-The buttons!

420
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:46,934
<i>Three.</i>

421
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,057
<i>Two. One.</i>

422
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,027
<i>Game clear.</i>

423
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:06,163
<i>Congratulations.</i>

424
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:35,606
Excuse me.

425
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:18,279
This person...

426
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:21,778
Were they also made
to participate in the game?

427
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:52,727
<i>Answer...</i>

428
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,140
<i>...in our hands now.</i>

429
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:56,899
"Answer"?

430
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,533
Hey, can you hear me?

431
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,196
Hey, what's this "answer"
you're talking about?

432
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:07,236
<i>Return.</i>

433
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:10,541
<i>The answer is in our hands now.</i>

434
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,753
<i>Return to the Beach.</i>

435
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,252
"The Beach"?

436
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:31,058
<i>Return.</i>

437
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,682
<i>Return to the Beach.</i>

438
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,269
<i>Return to the Beach.</i>

439
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:44,686
