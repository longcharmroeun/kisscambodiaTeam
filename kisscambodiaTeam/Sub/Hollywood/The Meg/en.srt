00:00:57,363 --> 00:00:59,198
<i>Look at the sonar.</i>

2
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,133
<i>Let me know what you find.</i>

3
00:01:01,135 --> 00:01:03,268
<i>So far
nothing new, my friend.</i>

4
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,072
<i>It just keeps getting worse.</i>

5
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:30,661
D'Angelo, Marks,
talk to me.

6
00:01:30,663 --> 00:01:32,730
We've moved
to the sonar room.

7
00:01:32,732 --> 00:01:34,667
Just nine rescues so far.

8
00:01:35,635 --> 00:01:37,468
<i>It's a mess, man.</i>

9
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,372
<i>This is the worst
I've ever seen.</i>

10
00:01:40,074 --> 00:01:41,075
Help!

11
00:01:42,776 --> 00:01:44,309
Help!

12
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:46,644
Somebody help me!

13
00:01:46,646 --> 00:01:49,882
Help! Who's there?

14
00:01:53,419 --> 00:01:55,020
I got
one more survivor.

15
00:01:55,022 --> 00:01:56,587
Heading back
to the rescue vehicle now.

16
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:00,758
Marks. D'Angelo.

17
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,160
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

18
00:02:02,162 --> 00:02:03,728
I have no idea.

19
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,597
Listen.

20
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:18,377
<i>Jonas, we got
something outside the ship.</i>

21
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:20,647
<i>There's something out there.</i>

22
00:02:28,188 --> 00:02:29,189
Here.

23
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:31,489
You okay, pal?

24
00:02:36,263 --> 00:02:38,297
Oh, my God.

25
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:39,730
<i>Something's crushing the hull.</i>

26
00:02:39,732 --> 00:02:42,267
Get back to
the rescue vehicle. Now.

27
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:43,636
We're right behind you.

28
00:02:45,738 --> 00:02:47,471
You guys, move!

29
00:02:47,473 --> 00:02:48,708
Got him. Slide him up.

30
00:02:50,244 --> 00:02:52,311
Marks. D'Angelo. Report.

31
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:53,711
You almost here?

32
00:02:53,713 --> 00:02:55,881
<i>Jonas, listen to me.
We're trapped!</i>

33
00:02:55,883 --> 00:02:56,815
What?

34
00:02:56,817 --> 00:02:58,417
The impact jammed the hatch!

35
00:02:58,419 --> 00:02:59,619
Coming back.

36
00:03:02,156 --> 00:03:03,454
<i>The sub
is starting to collapse.</i>

37
00:03:03,456 --> 00:03:04,755
Marks!

38
00:03:04,757 --> 00:03:05,756
<i>Jonas,
we need you down here</i>

39
00:03:05,758 --> 00:03:07,125
before it's too late.

40
00:03:08,796 --> 00:03:10,963
The sub's been breached.

41
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:12,264
<i>There's water everywhere.</i>

42
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:13,899
<i>Jonas,
the room is flooding.</i>

43
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:16,701
<i>Marks, we gotta
get this hatch open.</i>

44
00:03:16,703 --> 00:03:18,270
<i>Come on, Jonas.
Where are you?</i>

45
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:19,938
<i>- It's not gonna work!</i>
<i>- Let us out!</i>

46
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,472
<i>Jonas, hurry, please!</i>

47
00:03:21,474 --> 00:03:23,342
<i>We just need
more time! Don't leave us!</i>

48
00:03:23,344 --> 00:03:25,344
<i>Jonas!</i>

49
00:03:25,346 --> 00:03:27,346
<i>Let us know
when you're here!</i>

50
00:03:27,348 --> 00:03:28,479
<i>Don't give up!</i>

51
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:29,881
<i>Jonas, please!</i>

52
00:03:29,883 --> 00:03:31,116
<i>Come down here, now!
Where are you?</i>

53
00:03:31,118 --> 00:03:32,252
<i>Jonas!</i>

54
00:03:39,692 --> 00:03:40,861
You've lost your mind!

55
00:03:41,627 --> 00:03:42,828
Back off, Heller.

56
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:45,197
If we go back, everyone dies.

57
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,666
Everyone.

58
00:03:58,745 --> 00:04:00,180
What have you done?

59
00:05:33,407 --> 00:05:36,640
Are we living the dream here
or what?

60
00:05:36,642 --> 00:05:39,677
Welcome to <i>Mana One,</i>
Mr. Morris.

61
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:41,246
Get that thing away from me.

62
00:05:41,248 --> 00:05:42,746
What are you doing?

63
00:05:42,748 --> 00:05:46,585
Come on, bring it in.
There we go.

64
00:05:46,587 --> 00:05:48,086
Good to see you again,
Mr. Morris.

65
00:05:48,088 --> 00:05:49,687
- Yeah.
- This way, please.

66
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:52,190
Hey, you always smell so nice.
What is that? Sandalwood?

67
00:05:52,192 --> 00:05:54,758
It's impressive so far,
I'll say.

68
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,128
Oh, here they are.

69
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,829
Do you remember
my daughter Suyin?

70
00:05:57,831 --> 00:05:59,264
Our chief marine biologist.

71
00:05:59,266 --> 00:06:00,565
Hi.

72
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,911
Sorry, what was that?

73
00:06:12,913 --> 00:06:14,815
- I didn't catch it.
- Uh...

74
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,416
She says she likes your hat.

75
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:20,152
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

76
00:06:20,154 --> 00:06:21,221
Yeah.

77
00:06:24,657 --> 00:06:27,259
- Let's go.
- Why don't we go? Yeah.

78
00:06:30,097 --> 00:06:31,899
Your granddaughter's
a pistol.

79
00:06:32,698 --> 00:06:33,901
Okay.

80
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:36,370
What have we here?

81
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,671
This is, um,

82
00:06:40,673 --> 00:06:43,041
really ugly.

83
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:44,242
You know, I realize that

84
00:06:44,244 --> 00:06:45,443
we're under construction
and everything,

85
00:06:45,445 --> 00:06:46,878
but I really think that

86
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,813
a world-class
research institute

87
00:06:48,815 --> 00:06:51,715
deserves
a world-class entrance.

88
00:06:51,717 --> 00:06:54,354
Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

89
00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:57,055
<i>O-Level.</i>

90
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:01,426
Whoa!

91
00:07:01,428 --> 00:07:03,628
Welcome to the O-Level.

92
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,031
Nice.

93
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:07,866
This is
our central hub,

94
00:07:07,868 --> 00:07:09,834
from which
researchers will access

95
00:07:09,836 --> 00:07:12,806
all five labs
once it's finished.

96
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,309
Wow!

97
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,413
Oh, look at that.

98
00:07:21,815 --> 00:07:23,884
That's not something
you see every day.

99
00:07:28,155 --> 00:07:31,189
Did you have
those whales here on cue?

100
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:35,126
I might have lured them
with some whale songs.

101
00:07:35,128 --> 00:07:39,132
This is Lucy
and her daughter Gracie.

102
00:07:40,534 --> 00:07:41,866
Incredible.

103
00:07:44,404 --> 00:07:45,503
Wow!

106
00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:50,811
Follow me quickly.
I hope we are on time.

107
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,277
Come on in.

108
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,414
Oh.

109
00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:56,147
Oh, man.

110
00:07:56,149 --> 00:07:57,816
I'd like you
to meet our engineer

111
00:07:57,818 --> 00:07:59,584
and sub designer, Jaxx.

112
00:07:59,586 --> 00:08:00,751
Hey, Doc.

113
00:08:00,753 --> 00:08:02,921
- Hello.

114
00:08:02,923 --> 00:08:05,523
Doctor Heller.
Our medical officer.

115
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:06,925
Nice to meet you.

116
00:08:06,927 --> 00:08:08,293
You're like Bones, huh?

117
00:08:08,295 --> 00:08:11,496
DJ here pilots
our remote explorer.

118
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:12,697
How's it going?

119
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:14,132
You're my first billionaire.

120
00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:16,901
And of course, Mac,
our station chief.

121
00:08:16,903 --> 00:08:18,503
Mr. Morris, just in time.

122
00:08:18,505 --> 00:08:19,571
So I keep hearing.

123
00:08:19,573 --> 00:08:21,072
Try that.

124
00:08:21,074 --> 00:08:22,340
Just in time for what?

125
00:08:22,342 --> 00:08:24,276
<i>Good morning,
Mr. Morris.</i>

126
00:08:24,278 --> 00:08:26,678
Lori Taylor,
our mission pilot.

127
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,013
<i>Hi, Mr. Morris.</i>

128
00:08:28,015 --> 00:08:29,014
Welcome on board.
It's good to have you.

129
00:08:29,016 --> 00:08:30,148
<i>Hey.</i>

130
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,416
How's it going down there?

131
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:33,451
Where'd you learn
how to pilot a sub?

132
00:08:33,453 --> 00:08:35,487
<i>I spent ten years

that shall remain unnamed

135
00:08:39,426 --> 00:08:41,226
Yeah, ask her
if she ever blew up

136
00:08:41,228 --> 00:08:42,761
a whaling ship
with a homemade torpedo.

137
00:08:42,763 --> 00:08:43,828
Hey.

138
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,963
No.

139
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,000
That is a good hire.

140
00:08:49,002 --> 00:08:50,502
<i>Eleven in two.</i>

141
00:08:50,504 --> 00:08:54,272
<i>Water temperature
is at six degrees.</i>

142
00:08:54,274 --> 00:08:56,241
Mac, we are
through the thermocline.

143
00:08:56,243 --> 00:08:58,310
We are approaching
11,000 meters.

144
00:08:58,312 --> 00:09:00,981
One hundred meters
from the bottom.

145
00:09:01,682 --> 00:09:03,114
<i>Maybe.</i>

146
00:09:03,116 --> 00:09:05,016
<i>Maybe from the bottom.</i>

147
00:09:05,018 --> 00:09:07,852
"Maybe"? What does
he mean, "maybe"?

148
00:09:07,854 --> 00:09:09,888
Come on. Look at this.

149
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,556
Since 1875,

150
00:09:11,558 --> 00:09:13,992
we've all believed
the Mariana Trench

151
00:09:13,994 --> 00:09:15,660
was the deepest place
on Earth.

152
00:09:15,662 --> 00:09:18,363
I've had a theory that
what we think is the bottom

153
00:09:18,365 --> 00:09:21,099
might actually be a layer
of hydrogen sulfide.

154
00:09:21,101 --> 00:09:22,767
Beneath that cloud,

155
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:24,336
and a freezing
cold thermocline,

156
00:09:24,338 --> 00:09:26,638
there could be
a completely new world.

157
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,173
Wow!

158
00:09:28,175 --> 00:09:29,874
The <i>Origin</i> is about to see
if my father is right.

159
00:09:29,876 --> 00:09:31,710
If there is warm water below,

160
00:09:31,712 --> 00:09:34,579
that means we're going to be
the first to see it.

161
00:09:34,581 --> 00:09:36,047
And what if you're wrong?

162
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:39,718
Then you have wasted
$1.3 billion.

163
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:43,290
You're kidding.

164
00:09:46,026 --> 00:09:47,525
He's kidding, right?

165
00:09:47,527 --> 00:09:48,794
Copy that.

166
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,028
Wait. What?

167
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,565
Ten meters.
Approaching boundary.

168
00:09:57,003 --> 00:09:58,903
Hovering at five meters.

169
00:09:58,905 --> 00:10:00,004
Full stop.

170
00:10:00,006 --> 00:10:01,306
Final checks.

171
00:10:01,308 --> 00:10:02,640
- Jaxx?
- Good to go.

172
00:10:02,642 --> 00:10:03,942
- Doc?
- Crew are go.

173
00:10:03,944 --> 00:10:06,177
- DJ?
- Sub and rover are a go.

174
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:07,512
<i>Origin</i> crew,

175
00:10:07,514 --> 00:10:09,214
we are go for insertion.

176
00:10:09,216 --> 00:10:11,416
Insertion.

177
00:10:11,418 --> 00:10:13,251
Is everything sexual
with you guys?

178
00:10:13,253 --> 00:10:15,653
Sex, food, power and...

179
00:10:15,655 --> 00:10:16,988
Money.

180
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,859
Blow it up now.

181
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:21,092
<i>Dive control,</i>

182
00:10:21,094 --> 00:10:23,928
we are a go for... insertion.

183
00:10:37,377 --> 00:10:38,878
We're in.

184
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,146
You guys, we're in.

185
00:10:41,148 --> 00:10:43,214
<i>It's a cloud.
It is not the bottom.</i>

186
00:10:43,216 --> 00:10:45,250
Lori, be careful.
We don't know the depth

187
00:10:45,252 --> 00:10:46,651
<i>on the other side of this.</i>

188
00:10:46,653 --> 00:10:48,153
<i>The sea floor could come
right up on you.</i>

189
00:10:48,155 --> 00:10:50,524
<i>Copy that, Mac.
We're ready.</i>

190
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:01,633
You guys,
we are through!

191
00:11:01,635 --> 00:11:04,436
<i>I have multiple
small sonar contacts.</i>

192
00:11:04,438 --> 00:11:06,271
<i>There is life down here.</i>

193
00:11:06,273 --> 00:11:07,607
<i>Congratulations!</i>

194
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:10,310
Deploying the lights.

195
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,665
Lights deployed.
I'm gonna come around.

196
00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:48,513
Whoa!

197
00:11:48,515 --> 00:11:51,384
Oh, my goodness.

198
00:12:09,837 --> 00:12:11,338
- Wow!
- Whoa!

199
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:13,671
Mac, tell me
you're getting this.

200
00:12:13,673 --> 00:12:15,440
We're getting
all of it, Lori.

201
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:18,311
Got a lot of
smiling faces up here.

202
00:12:22,984 --> 00:12:25,485
DJ, we got positive terrain
to launch the rover.

203
00:12:26,052 --> 00:12:27,820
Copy.

204
00:12:27,822 --> 00:12:30,121
Launch is all yours.

205
00:12:30,123 --> 00:12:31,324
Okay.

206
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:33,760
Rover is

207
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:36,797
free.

208
00:12:38,431 --> 00:12:39,666
Copy.

209
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,804
<i>Water temperature</i>

210
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,474
<i>below three degrees Celsius.</i>

211
00:12:55,282 --> 00:12:57,651
How is this possible?

212
00:12:59,185 --> 00:13:01,753
This ecosystem
is completely cut off

213
00:13:01,755 --> 00:13:03,154
from the rest of the ocean

214
00:13:03,156 --> 00:13:05,156
by the freezing
cold thermocline.

215
00:13:05,158 --> 00:13:07,559
We should find
all sorts of species

216
00:13:07,561 --> 00:13:09,561
completely unknown to science.

217
00:13:09,563 --> 00:13:12,465
Sounds like a good investment.

218
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:18,136
Lori, I have a contact.

219
00:13:18,138 --> 00:13:20,273
Bearing zero eight zero.

220
00:13:22,108 --> 00:13:23,943
Huh. It's big.

221
00:13:23,945 --> 00:13:25,743
Oh, it's huge.

222
00:13:25,745 --> 00:13:27,080
And it's moving fast.

223
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,786
DJ,
is the rover seeing this?

224
00:13:33,653 --> 00:13:34,787
Negative.

225
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:36,723
Let me try
and bring up some more lights.

226
00:13:42,997 --> 00:13:45,096
Rover One, <i>signal interrupted.</i>

227
00:13:45,098 --> 00:13:47,098
Whoa! I just lost telemetry.

228
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,301
What the hell?

229
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:52,770
<i>Origin,</i> recommend

230
00:13:52,772 --> 00:13:54,105
an immediate right turn
to three-five-zero.

231
00:13:54,107 --> 00:13:55,508
<i>This could be a landslide.</i>

232
00:14:04,584 --> 00:14:06,417
Last time I checked,
landslides don't make

233
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:08,219
<i>90-degree turns.</i>

234
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:10,223
It's right on us!
It's right on us!

235
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:16,527
What the hell was that?

236
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:19,631
Lori, what's going on
down there?

237
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:20,531
You guys...

238
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:22,469
- What?
- Come look at this.

239
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:25,737
Whoa!

240
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,806
What could do that
to the rover?

241
00:14:27,808 --> 00:14:30,009
I don't think
I wanna know.

242
00:14:31,645 --> 00:14:33,146
It's coming back.

243
00:14:36,349 --> 00:14:37,649
Oh, my God!

244
00:14:37,651 --> 00:14:39,317
<i>Let's get out of here.
Blow the tanks.</i>

245
00:14:39,319 --> 00:14:40,585
<i>I'm trying.
It's not working!</i>

246
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:42,253
<i>- It's not starting!</i>
<i>- Mac, help!</i>

247
00:14:42,255 --> 00:14:43,789
- Whole system's down!
- Oh, my God.

248
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,224
<i>Oh, my God. DJ, Mac.
There's something down here.</i>

249
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:47,592
<i>Jonas was right.</i>

250
00:14:47,594 --> 00:14:49,396
<i>Jonas was right! Do you co...</i>

251
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,632
Lori, come in.

252
00:14:54,634 --> 00:14:55,903
<i>Origin,</i> can you hear me?

253
00:14:56,871 --> 00:14:59,972
<i>Origin,</i> please respond.

254
00:14:59,974 --> 00:15:01,675
- Come on.
- Lori, come in.

255
00:15:04,979 --> 00:15:06,613
Wall, can you hear me?

256
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,184
Toshi?

257
00:15:13,653 --> 00:15:16,989
Gather around, people.
Options.

258
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,090
Not great.

259
00:15:18,092 --> 00:15:19,657
We know they're alive.

260
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:22,127
I've still got telemetry
on their vitals.

261
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,962
How long do they have?

262
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,164
Maybe 18 hours.

263
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,364
Ballast valves
are jammed,

264
00:15:26,366 --> 00:15:27,866
which means
it can't rise by itself.

265
00:15:27,868 --> 00:15:29,001
If we attempt to tow it,

266
00:15:29,003 --> 00:15:31,335
it's fifty-fifty
that the tanks will explode,

267
00:15:31,337 --> 00:15:32,770
and breach the capsule.

268
00:15:32,772 --> 00:15:34,840
- Can't we go hatch-to-hatch?
- Not a chance.

269
00:15:34,842 --> 00:15:37,442
The external camera's
showing severe hatch damage.

270
00:15:37,444 --> 00:15:38,944
We have to try something.

271
00:15:38,946 --> 00:15:40,511
They're six miles down

272
00:15:40,513 --> 00:15:42,680
and no one has ever attempted
a rescue at that depth.

273
00:15:42,682 --> 00:15:44,250
Well, that's not exactly true.

274
00:15:45,285 --> 00:15:47,418
No. No way.

275
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,753
We can handle this.

276
00:15:48,755 --> 00:15:50,421
Not at 11,000 meters,
you can't.

277
00:15:50,423 --> 00:15:53,458
We've gone 5,000 meters.
8,000 meters.

278
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,493
At some point,
it just becomes a number.

279
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:57,062
Why don't you try this number?

280
00:15:57,064 --> 00:16:00,032
Three. That's how many people
have actually attempted

281
00:16:00,034 --> 00:16:01,934
a rescue below 10,000 meters.

282
00:16:01,936 --> 00:16:03,735
And the number one.

283
00:16:03,737 --> 00:16:05,403
That's how many are left alive
to talk about it.

284
00:16:05,405 --> 00:16:06,704
One man. Jonas Taylor.

285
00:16:06,706 --> 00:16:08,439
And look what happened
to that one man

286
00:16:08,441 --> 00:16:09,975
the last time he went
to these depths.

287
00:16:09,977 --> 00:16:11,375
He saved eleven people,

288
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:12,577
including you, Heller.
That's what happened.

289
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:14,113
He left our friends to die,

290
00:16:14,115 --> 00:16:16,414
because he had
pressure-induced psychosis.

291
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,382
Come on, Heller.
That was your diagnosis.

292
00:16:18,384 --> 00:16:20,585
Jonas said
something attacked them.

293
00:16:20,587 --> 00:16:22,955
Something big enough to
take out a nuclear submarine.

294
00:16:22,957 --> 00:16:24,223
He's a drunk.

295
00:16:24,225 --> 00:16:25,690
You're not listening!
You're not listening!

296
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:27,325
He washed up on a beach
in Thailand.

297
00:16:27,327 --> 00:16:28,794
- Did you hear what Lori said?
- I'm listening. I heard it.

298
00:16:28,796 --> 00:16:29,029
- Were you there?
- That's enough.

299
00:16:31,631 --> 00:16:34,867
We all heard
Lori's last transmission.

300
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,267
We have to consider

301
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:37,702
that <i>Origin</i> may have
encountered

302
00:16:37,704 --> 00:16:40,304
something similar to what
Jonas Taylor described.

303
00:16:40,306 --> 00:16:42,507
Something he was able
to escape from.

304
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:44,709
<i>Ba!</i> Please.

305
00:16:45,712 --> 00:16:47,478
Prep the helicopter.

306
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,716
We must go to Thailand.

307
00:17:25,718 --> 00:17:27,019
Your boat,

308
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:28,854
she's killing me.

309
00:17:28,856 --> 00:17:31,056
Number one engine
slips out of the gear,

310
00:17:31,058 --> 00:17:32,557
and there's some leak
in the hydraulics.

311
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,226
Hey, I'll take a look
at it tonight.

312
00:17:34,228 --> 00:17:35,459
That's what you said
last night

313
00:17:35,461 --> 00:17:36,694
and the night before that,

314
00:17:36,696 --> 00:17:38,563
and the night before that.

315
00:17:38,565 --> 00:17:39,730
Hey, I'm working up to it.

316
00:17:39,732 --> 00:17:41,499
You drink too much.

317
00:17:41,501 --> 00:17:42,835
Hey, now
you're only saying that

318
00:17:42,837 --> 00:17:45,838
because I literally have
a beer in my hand.

319
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,539
You always have beer
in your hand.

320
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:49,777
You know why?

321
00:17:50,677 --> 00:17:52,543
Because I drink too much?

322
00:18:15,336 --> 00:18:19,004
Now this is shaping up to be
an eventful Tuesday evening.

323
00:18:19,006 --> 00:18:21,306
You know
I like to make an entrance.

324
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,673
Hell, Mac, after five years,

325
00:18:22,675 --> 00:18:24,475
just showing up
is making an entrance.

326
00:18:24,477 --> 00:18:26,644
What? You're living
above a bar? Really?

327
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:28,648
Figured it was the only way
to get you to come visit.

328
00:18:32,485 --> 00:18:34,052
Jonas,
allow me to introduce...

329
00:18:34,054 --> 00:18:35,720
It's an honor to meet you,
Doctor Zhang.

330
00:18:35,722 --> 00:18:38,556
Always had a tremendous
respect for your work.

331
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:39,992
You're too kind, Mr. Taylor.

332
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,960
Yeah, no, I'm not.
You're a good man.

333
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:44,495
Hey, can I offer
either of you two a beer?

334
00:18:44,497 --> 00:18:46,899
'Cause I'm gonna have a beer.

335
00:18:46,901 --> 00:18:48,834
It's not a social call, Jonas.

336
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,970
You mean you didn't helicopter
in just to say "hi"?

337
00:18:51,972 --> 00:18:54,772
You wound me, Mac.

338
00:18:54,774 --> 00:18:57,575
- We have a serious...
- Problem?

339
00:18:57,577 --> 00:18:59,311
Thought so.

340
00:18:59,313 --> 00:19:01,179
Just like you know

341
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,414
I don't dive anymore.

342
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,649
Done being responsible
for people, Mac.

343
00:19:04,651 --> 00:19:05,951
Mr. Taylor...

344
00:19:05,953 --> 00:19:07,652
Hey, I mean no offense,
Doctor Zhang.

345
00:19:07,654 --> 00:19:09,720
I mean, if there was
two people on this planet

346
00:19:09,722 --> 00:19:11,522
that could get me
back into the water,

347
00:19:11,524 --> 00:19:13,557
it's probably you two.

348
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:14,960
But you can't.

349
00:19:14,962 --> 00:19:18,163
You're gonna tell me your
problem, and I'll say no.

350
00:19:18,165 --> 00:19:20,032
You're gonna offer me money.

351
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,166
I'll still say no.

352
00:19:21,168 --> 00:19:23,768
You're gonna appeal
to my better nature,

353
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,404
and I'm gonna say no.

354
00:19:25,406 --> 00:19:27,406
Because I don't have one.

355
00:19:27,408 --> 00:19:30,474
So I say,
why don't we sit down?

356
00:19:30,476 --> 00:19:32,110
We'll enjoy a couple of beers,

357
00:19:32,112 --> 00:19:33,946
and then we can
get you on your way.

358
00:19:35,349 --> 00:19:37,548
Jonas.

359
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:40,718
This happened this morning.

360
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,988
<i>Let's get out
of here. Blow the tanks!</i>

361
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,588
<i>I'm trying.
It's not working!</i>

362
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,924
<i>It's not starting!
Whole system's down!</i>

363
00:19:45,926 --> 00:19:47,793
<i>Mac, help!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

364
00:19:47,795 --> 00:19:50,594
<i>DJ, Mac.
There's something down here.</i>

365
00:19:50,596 --> 00:19:51,797
<i>Jonas was right.</i>

366
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:53,098
<i>Jonas was right!
Do you co...</i>

367
00:19:54,168 --> 00:19:55,700
It's Lori.

368
00:19:55,702 --> 00:19:58,136
Your ex-wife
and her crew are trapped

369
00:19:58,138 --> 00:20:00,571
below 11,000 meters.

370
00:20:00,573 --> 00:20:01,974
I fear they may
have encountered

371
00:20:01,976 --> 00:20:04,376
the same species
you did down there.

372
00:20:04,378 --> 00:20:08,113
I have divers with less
experience willing to go.

373
00:20:08,115 --> 00:20:10,082
But I feel
I owe it to my crew

374
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:13,821
to give this rescue
the best chance of success.

375
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:17,724
Please.

376
00:20:25,698 --> 00:20:27,734
Lori,
hand me that hexa key.

377
00:20:28,902 --> 00:20:29,937
Thanks.

378
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,639
Oh.

379
00:20:35,641 --> 00:20:37,976
Okay.

380
00:20:37,978 --> 00:20:39,411
Okay, if we can
short out the firewall,

381
00:20:39,413 --> 00:20:41,547
I can... I can probably
reboot the computers.

382
00:20:44,385 --> 00:20:46,552
Okay. Try it now.

383
00:20:51,358 --> 00:20:53,559
Auxiliary power's back.

384
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,897
Heaters are online.

385
00:20:58,899 --> 00:21:00,432
There's no way that we'll
get the engine started,

386
00:21:00,434 --> 00:21:03,235
but we might be able
to get the ballast tanks back.

387
00:21:04,704 --> 00:21:06,304
What are you doing?
Taking notes?

388
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,142
Letter to my wife.

389
00:21:11,245 --> 00:21:12,712
Just in case.

390
00:21:13,514 --> 00:21:14,712
Hey.

391
00:21:14,714 --> 00:21:16,448
We got this.

392
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,716
Step by step.

393
00:21:18,718 --> 00:21:21,721
Come on. Give me
that fighting octopus.

394
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:33,432
See?

395
00:21:33,434 --> 00:21:34,968
Works every time.

396
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,208
No.

397
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,709
- What?
- We gotta can the lights.

398
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:08,400
Turn out the lights.

399
00:22:08,402 --> 00:22:10,102
<i>There was
something down there with us.</i>

400
00:22:10,104 --> 00:22:11,303
<i>How can you be
sure if there were</i>

401
00:22:11,305 --> 00:22:13,405
<i>no observation windows
on your craft?</i>

402
00:22:13,407 --> 00:22:15,107
<i>'Cause whatever it was</i>

403
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:18,410
<i>caved in the entire starboard
side of a nuclear submarine.</i>

404
00:22:18,412 --> 00:22:19,911
<i>That wasn't my imagination.</i>

405
00:22:19,913 --> 00:22:22,180
<i>Is that why
you blew the hatch mid-rescue?</i>

406
00:22:22,182 --> 00:22:25,749
<i>Hey, look, I brought 11 men
back safe and sound.</i>

407
00:22:25,751 --> 00:22:27,352
<i>You left
eight more to die</i>

408
00:22:27,354 --> 00:22:28,520
<i>because you panicked.</i>

409
00:22:28,522 --> 00:22:30,856
<i>If I hadn't blown the hatch,</i>

410
00:22:30,858 --> 00:22:33,024
<i>we all would have been
killed by that thing.</i>

411
00:22:33,026 --> 00:22:34,326
<i>There was no thing.</i>

412
00:22:34,328 --> 00:22:35,827
<i>There was no evidence
of anything.</i>

413
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:37,095
<i>Because
it was destroyed</i>

414
00:22:37,097 --> 00:22:38,662
<i>in the explosion, Heller.</i>

415
00:22:38,664 --> 00:22:41,867
<i>Look, there was no time left!
So I made the call!</i>

416
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:43,767
<i>And you left
our friends there to die</i>

417
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:46,006
<i>in an act of cowardice!</i>

418
00:22:48,175 --> 00:22:50,708
What do you think
happened down there?

419
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,244
He lost it.

420
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:54,012
And now we're
about to send him

421
00:22:54,014 --> 00:22:56,148
into the exact same situation.

422
00:22:57,618 --> 00:22:58,950
Excuse me, Suyin.

423
00:22:58,952 --> 00:23:00,919
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but we need you.

424
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,389
It's an emergency.

425
00:23:03,624 --> 00:23:05,656
What's wrong, Jaxx?

426
00:23:05,658 --> 00:23:07,025
Now they're leaking oxygen.

427
00:23:07,027 --> 00:23:08,896
They've got a couple of hours.
Maybe more.

428
00:23:10,797 --> 00:23:12,330
- I'm going.
- No.

429
00:23:12,332 --> 00:23:13,532
Wait, what?

430
00:23:13,534 --> 00:23:15,467
I'll take one of the gliders,
grab the <i>Origin,</i>

431
00:23:15,469 --> 00:23:17,135
- and tow her up.
- Wait!

432
00:23:17,137 --> 00:23:19,306
If the <i>Origin's</i> ballast tanks
blow, you're gonna die, too.

433
00:23:19,907 --> 00:23:21,909
We have to try.

434
00:23:24,744 --> 00:23:26,446
Mummy?

435
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:30,882
Meiying.

436
00:23:35,155 --> 00:23:36,223
Um...

437
00:23:46,699 --> 00:23:48,068
Uh...

438
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:10,924
Communications check!

439
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,894
Good to go.

440
00:24:15,896 --> 00:24:19,364
Suyin, you are go for launch.

441
00:24:19,366 --> 00:24:20,766
Richard Byrd.

442
00:24:42,322 --> 00:24:45,092
<i>Auto descent
sequence initiated.</i>

443
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,863
- Hey, Meiying.
- Hi.

444
00:25:19,192 --> 00:25:22,060
- Sir, we've got a new problem.
- It's your daughter.

445
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,129
She took a glider
to try and save them.

446
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:25,463
Why did you let her go?

447
00:25:25,465 --> 00:25:27,932
Trust me,
I didn't let her do anything.

448
00:25:27,934 --> 00:25:29,367
I was sort of
under the impression

449
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:30,935
you're supposed to try
to save people

450
00:25:30,937 --> 00:25:31,803
who are dying
on the bottom of the ocean.

451
00:25:31,805 --> 00:25:33,071
Who's he?

452
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,042
I'm the guy
who paid for all this.

453
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,609
Uh-huh.

454
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:39,978
You know, he looks heroic
and he walks fast,

455
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,083
but he's kind of
got a negative attitude.

456
00:25:46,788 --> 00:25:48,053
What's the window?

457
00:25:48,055 --> 00:25:49,956
It'll be close.

458
00:25:51,825 --> 00:25:53,091
Who are you?

459
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,326
I'm the one
that designed all this.

460
00:25:54,328 --> 00:25:56,194
So my life's in your hands?

461
00:25:56,196 --> 00:25:59,331
Pretty much. That a problem?

462
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:00,265
Nah.

463
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,466
You look like you might

464
00:26:01,468 --> 00:26:03,468
actually know
what you're doing.

465
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,670
<i>Dive control level.</i>

466
00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:07,205
Oh, I'm sorry.

467
00:26:07,207 --> 00:26:10,608
Mac, have Doctor Heller
meet us in the medical bay.

468
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,811
Heller?

469
00:26:11,813 --> 00:26:13,845
Did I not mention that?

470
00:26:13,847 --> 00:26:15,282
You mother...

471
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,586
He's in perfect shape.

472
00:26:21,588 --> 00:26:23,523
Just like the last time
you examined me.

473
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,226
Suyin took a glider
15 minutes ago.

474
00:26:28,228 --> 00:26:29,861
She's planning
on taking the <i>Origin</i> back up.

475
00:26:29,863 --> 00:26:31,162
Take me to the sub.

476
00:26:31,164 --> 00:26:33,231
- We're not done here.
- Yeah, we are.

477
00:26:33,233 --> 00:26:34,466
Lori's running out of air,

478
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:35,967
and we're in
international waters,

479
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,302
which means legally

480
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,137
I can beat the ever-loving
shit out of you

481
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,074
and get away with it.

482
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:43,942
It's true.

483
00:26:43,944 --> 00:26:45,178
Legally, I mean.

484
00:26:46,446 --> 00:26:48,515
Good thing
he doesn't hold a grudge.

485
00:26:49,182 --> 00:26:50,582
Jonas, you do know

486
00:26:50,584 --> 00:26:52,384
that this sub is rated
for 12,000 meters, right?

487
00:26:52,386 --> 00:26:54,552
Like the one leaking
on the ocean floor?

488
00:26:54,554 --> 00:26:56,822
Ah. Good point.

489
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,356
- We good?
- Yep.

490
00:26:58,358 --> 00:26:59,825
Once you strip back
the safeties

491
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:02,394
and go full manual,
like I know you're gonna do,

492
00:27:02,396 --> 00:27:03,796
the system's gonna
have problems

493
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:06,297
trying to keep up
with your pressure changes.

494
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:07,999
Try not to blow
your ears out, brother.

495
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,070
Thanks, mate.

496
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,984
Hello, skipper.

497
00:27:25,986 --> 00:27:27,921
You must be the crazy guy.

498
00:27:28,722 --> 00:27:30,555
Now who called me that?

499
00:27:30,557 --> 00:27:32,359
My mom. Doctor Heller.

500
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,027
Yeah, well, I'm not crazy.

501
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,263
I've just seen things
no one else has.

502
00:27:38,265 --> 00:27:40,900
That's the definition
of crazy.

503
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:46,940
Backup power. Backup power...

504
00:27:51,813 --> 00:27:53,445
So where are your parents?

505
00:27:53,447 --> 00:27:56,181
My mom's trying
to bring our friends back

506
00:27:56,183 --> 00:27:58,483
from the bottom of the ocean.

507
00:27:58,485 --> 00:28:02,487
My dad's with a Pilates
instructor in Taipei.

508
00:28:02,489 --> 00:28:05,256
Granddad says
Mom needs to move on,

509
00:28:05,258 --> 00:28:07,158
but Mom says
she needs some more time

510
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,227
because she was
married to an a-hole.

511
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,231
Sounds like
your mom's got a point.

512
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:17,435
You know a lot.

513
00:28:17,437 --> 00:28:19,973
Eight-year-olds
hear everything.

514
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:23,677
Mind if I give it a try?

515
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,048
Bye.

516
00:28:33,053 --> 00:28:34,287
Hey, Crazy.

517
00:28:35,655 --> 00:28:38,590
Is my mom gonna die?

518
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:41,894
I'll have <i>Captain Bubbles</i>
and your mom back in no time.

519
00:28:41,896 --> 00:28:43,997
I promise.

520
00:28:49,002 --> 00:28:50,602
Thank you, Emma.

538
00:30:06,313 --> 00:30:08,847
How is he descending so fast?

539
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:11,316
Looks like he's diverted
all nonessential power

540
00:30:11,318 --> 00:30:13,318
like heat and life support
to the motors.

541
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,719
He's gonna black out.

542
00:30:17,892 --> 00:30:19,860
His blood gases are dropping.

543
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:23,261
Jonas.

00:30:42,349 --> 00:30:44,315
Tell her to get
out of the way, Mac.

551
00:30:44,317 --> 00:30:45,750
More people means more risk

552
00:30:45,752 --> 00:30:47,185
<i>and she's in

553
00:30:47,187 --> 00:30:49,623
Jonas, you just

554
00:30:51,124 --> 00:30:52,423
What?

555
00:30:52,425 --> 00:30:53,859
The little green button

<i>Call you from the other side.</i>

567
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:42,141
You got Wi-Fi here?

568
00:31:42,143 --> 00:31:43,576
All right.

569
00:31:44,377 --> 00:31:45,710
Okay.

570

Toshi, is it still out there?

00:31:49,249 --> 00:31:50,682
I can't tell.

573
00:31:50,684 --> 00:31:52,552
I can't see anything

574
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:28,352
Oh.

575
00:32:28,354 --> 00:32:30,621
There it is.

576
00:32:30,623 --> 00:32:32,091
I've got visual
on the <i>Origin.</i>

00:32:35,096 --> 00:32:36,663

586
00:33:09,864 --> 00:33:12,663
<i>There is something

<i>Suyin, what's happening?</i>

589
00:33:31,484 --> 00:33:32,951
It's a huge squid.

590
00:33:32,953 --> 00:33:34,385
It's got the glider.

591

<i>It's like 20, 25 meters.</i>

Tell me this isn't the world's

You came all the way here

Pretty much.

00:38:20,908 --> 00:38:23,275
<i>Doctor Heller has vitals
on Lori and The Wall,</i>

655
00:38:23,277 --> 00:38:25,312
<i>but we don't have Toshi.</i>

656
00:38:26,113 --> 00:38:27,281
<i>Is Toshi okay?</i>

657
00:38:28,748 --> 00:38:31,118
<i>Jonas, is Toshi okay?</i>

658
00:38:32,453 --> 00:38:33,819
- All right.
- Nice and easy.

659
00:38:33,821 --> 00:38:35,287
Yeah. Yep.

660
00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:36,822
- Don't move her neck.
- Careful.

661
00:38:36,824 --> 00:38:39,793
That's good.
Grab a hold. We got her.

662
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:53,637
You couldn't bring
Toshi back?

663
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:56,376
- Why not?
- He closed the hatch.

664
00:38:58,212 --> 00:38:59,712
He saved us.

665
00:39:00,746 --> 00:39:02,349
You left him.

666
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:07,185
You left him
because that's who you are.

667
00:39:07,187 --> 00:39:09,620
You are the guy
who leaves people behind.

668
00:39:09,622 --> 00:39:11,289
You go that deep,

669
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:13,158
you take your life
in your hands.

670
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,063
It was your choice
to send them down.

671
00:39:20,467 --> 00:39:23,303
This is why
I don't do this anymore, Mac.

672
00:39:35,549 --> 00:39:36,749
How is she?

673
00:39:39,386 --> 00:39:41,652
Well, the puncture
just missed her liver.

674
00:39:41,654 --> 00:39:43,288
She lost a lot of blood.

675
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,825
But she's stable.

676
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:53,800
Jonas.

677
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,205
I'm sorry.

678
00:39:59,306 --> 00:40:00,908
I was wrong.

679
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,045
You save Lori,

680
00:40:06,013 --> 00:40:07,814
we can call it even.

681
00:40:35,042 --> 00:40:37,375
I just want to apologize
for before.

682
00:40:37,377 --> 00:40:39,778
I was angry
and I lose my temper.

683
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,248
And you did save my...

684
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,351
You're naked.

685
00:40:48,956 --> 00:40:53,860
I know you did all you could.
So, thank you.

686
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:55,961
Yeah.

687
00:40:55,963 --> 00:40:58,196
You're welcome.

688
00:40:58,198 --> 00:41:01,902
I know it's not easy
being the person who survives.

689
00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:05,637
I'm gonna go now.

690
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:06,770
You should
put on some clothes.

691
00:41:06,772 --> 00:41:09,074
Yep. That's the original plan.

692
00:41:09,076 --> 00:41:11,211
Okay, then. Carry on.

693
00:41:31,064 --> 00:41:33,865
Hi. Uh... I was...

694
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:35,269
It's all good.

695
00:41:36,937 --> 00:41:39,571
Jonas and Lori were the worst
married couple ever, you know?

696
00:41:39,573 --> 00:41:40,771
Uh-huh.

697
00:41:40,773 --> 00:41:43,043
Whole experiment
was over in a year.

698
00:41:44,444 --> 00:41:46,313
I didn't ask anything.

699
00:41:47,281 --> 00:41:48,949
I know.

700
00:41:54,388 --> 00:41:57,822
This is what
attacked us. A megalodon.

701
00:41:57,824 --> 00:41:59,991
How big is that thing?

702
00:41:59,993 --> 00:42:04,129
Between 70 and 90 feet.
21 to 27 meters.

703
00:42:04,131 --> 00:42:08,033
The megalodon was the largest
shark that ever existed.

704
00:42:08,035 --> 00:42:09,934
It feared nothing.

705
00:42:09,936 --> 00:42:12,570
It had no predators.

706
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:16,074
Its jaws were stronger
than any other animal, ever.

707
00:42:16,076 --> 00:42:18,943
The meg could bite
a whale in half,

708
00:42:18,945 --> 00:42:20,712
crushing through the bones.

709
00:42:20,714 --> 00:42:22,747
We are
in uncharted territory.

710
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,149
Until today

711
00:42:24,151 --> 00:42:26,551
megalodons were thought
to have been extinct

712
00:42:26,553 --> 00:42:28,119
for over two million years.

713
00:42:28,121 --> 00:42:30,455
- Wrong.
- A living fossil.

714
00:42:30,457 --> 00:42:33,427
That living fossil
ate my friend.

715
00:42:35,128 --> 00:42:36,995
I cannot begin
to express

716
00:42:36,997 --> 00:42:38,863
my sadness for Toshi's death.

717
00:42:38,865 --> 00:42:40,932
We have the discovery
of a lifetime.

718
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:43,403
This is what Toshi worked for.

719
00:42:45,272 --> 00:42:47,072
It's what
we've all worked for.

720
00:42:47,074 --> 00:42:50,575
But we're going
to have to proceed slowly.

721
00:42:50,577 --> 00:42:53,380
Yeah, that's really
not gonna work for me.

722
00:42:55,982 --> 00:42:58,151
What is <i>Mana One?</i>

723
00:42:58,885 --> 00:43:00,185
This station?

724
00:43:00,187 --> 00:43:02,155
Yes. And what's it doing?

725
00:43:03,023 --> 00:43:05,092
Hmm? Right now.

726
00:43:07,461 --> 00:43:08,760
Exactly.

727
00:43:08,762 --> 00:43:10,762
Nothing.

728
00:43:10,764 --> 00:43:12,364
20 million dollar rover, gone.

729
00:43:12,366 --> 00:43:15,233
Thirty million dollar sub,
gone.

730
00:43:15,235 --> 00:43:17,235
You are now sitting
in the most expensive

731
00:43:17,237 --> 00:43:19,971
underwater marine
biology day camp

732
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:21,774
in human history.

733
00:43:21,776 --> 00:43:24,042
Hey, Crazy.

734
00:43:24,044 --> 00:43:25,477
And now that
we've actually

735
00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:27,080
found something amazing,

736
00:43:27,849 --> 00:43:30,081
we can't proceed slowly.

737
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:33,251
Thank you
for keeping your promise.

738
00:43:33,253 --> 00:43:34,854
- You're welcome.
- You don't quit

739
00:43:34,856 --> 00:43:37,122
trying to get to the Moon
because you lose an astronaut.

740
00:43:37,124 --> 00:43:38,556
You charge forward,

741
00:43:38,558 --> 00:43:41,626
or someone else
will get there first.

742
00:43:41,628 --> 00:43:44,929
Other people will want
a piece of this thing,

743
00:43:44,931 --> 00:43:47,332
whether we like it or not.

744
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:49,002
You seem to like it.

745
00:43:50,404 --> 00:43:54,439
- Excuse me?
- I said, you seem to like it.

746
00:43:54,441 --> 00:43:57,008
I'm sorry.
Is he part of this team?

747
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,411
You're damn right
he's a part of this team.

748
00:43:59,413 --> 00:44:01,279
Okay.

749
00:44:01,281 --> 00:44:02,747
You ever think
that Mother Nature

750
00:44:02,749 --> 00:44:05,316
might know what she's doing?

751
00:44:05,318 --> 00:44:10,221
The thermocline might
just be there for a reason?

752
00:44:10,223 --> 00:44:14,993
Hey, look, you wanna explore?
Go ahead, explore.

753
00:44:14,995 --> 00:44:18,096
But if you start sending
people back down there,

754
00:44:18,098 --> 00:44:20,632
don't call me
to come save your asses.

755
00:44:20,634 --> 00:44:22,233
Because in case what happened
down there

756
00:44:22,235 --> 00:44:24,202
wasn't clear to you,

757
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:27,138
man vs. meg isn't a fight.

758
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,442
It's a slaughter.

759
00:44:43,089 --> 00:44:45,256
<i>O-Level.</i>

760
00:45:24,799 --> 00:45:27,632
What you people discovered
is an even bigger goldmine

761
00:45:27,634 --> 00:45:29,902
than we ever thought
possible.

762
00:45:29,904 --> 00:45:31,669
We are completely unprepared

763
00:45:31,671 --> 00:45:33,371
to deal with creatures
like megalodon.

764
00:45:33,373 --> 00:45:35,039
I understand,
and we can get prepared.

765
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:36,942
I'm talking about
a long-term plan.

766
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:32,499
That's gonna be
the other alternative.

767
00:46:35,068 --> 00:46:36,369
What's that?

768
00:46:40,707 --> 00:46:41,809
My daughter.

769
00:46:51,284 --> 00:46:52,717
Jonas.

770
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:53,986
- Did you see Meiying?
- We can't find Meiying.

771
00:46:53,988 --> 00:46:56,721
Meiying? Meiying?

772
00:46:56,723 --> 00:46:58,291
- I'll take this way.
- Let's try this way.

773
00:47:04,966 --> 00:47:06,166
Meiying.

774
00:47:06,733 --> 00:47:07,734
Meiying?

775
00:47:09,436 --> 00:47:11,304
- Meiying.
- Mama.

776
00:47:13,773 --> 00:47:15,774
Are you okay?

777
00:47:15,776 --> 00:47:19,912
There's a monster
and it's watching us.

778
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:41,434
It's okay.
It's just a whale.

779
00:47:42,602 --> 00:47:44,337
Wait. Where's Lucy?

780
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,973
Where's the mom?

781
00:48:00,654 --> 00:48:03,588
Is the station all right?
Report.

782
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:05,289
No leaks. No visible damage.

783
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:08,192
All right, team.
Initiate emergency protocols.

784
00:48:08,194 --> 00:48:09,661
And nobody is to go
near the water.

785
00:48:09,663 --> 00:48:10,662
If you insist.

786
00:48:10,664 --> 00:48:12,497
Turn off
all the underwater lighting.

787
00:48:12,499 --> 00:48:14,532
Restrict the crew
to essential areas.

788
00:48:14,534 --> 00:48:17,168
You said it was impossible
for it to get up here.

789
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:18,736
It should have been.

790
00:48:18,738 --> 00:48:20,538
You guys,
take a look at this.

791
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,875
When the glider came up,
the thermocline was intact,

792
00:48:22,877 --> 00:48:25,010
so it was
one degree Celsius, right?

793
00:48:25,012 --> 00:48:26,544
Yeah.

794
00:48:26,546 --> 00:48:28,713
But a minute later,
when the <i>Evolution</i> came up,

795
00:48:28,715 --> 00:48:30,816
the temperature increased
by 25 degrees.

796
00:48:30,818 --> 00:48:33,184
A shark could come
right through there.

797
00:48:33,186 --> 00:48:35,420
20 sharks for that matter.

798
00:48:35,422 --> 00:48:36,621
When the meg hit the <i>Origin,</i>

799
00:48:36,623 --> 00:48:38,090
it slammed into
a thermal vent.

800
00:48:38,092 --> 00:48:40,658
Those can release millions
of gallons per minute.

801
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,727
The heat from that vent
cleared the path

802
00:48:42,729 --> 00:48:44,462
through the freezing
cold layer.

803
00:48:44,464 --> 00:48:45,663
Are you saying we opened up

804
00:48:45,665 --> 00:48:47,166
a super highway
for giant sharks?

805
00:48:47,168 --> 00:48:50,334
Not exactly. It seems like
it was a transitory event.

806
00:48:50,336 --> 00:48:51,569
The temperatures
are returned to normal

807
00:48:51,571 --> 00:48:53,204
and the gap is closed.

808
00:48:53,206 --> 00:48:56,374
Yeah. But not before a massive
prehistoric killing machine

809
00:48:56,376 --> 00:48:57,876
decided to come up
and say "Hi."

810
00:48:57,878 --> 00:49:00,278
Hey, look, we're wasting time.
That thing's out there.

811
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,748
We need to find it
and kill it.

812
00:49:02,183 --> 00:49:03,681
No.

813
00:49:03,683 --> 00:49:08,153
We can't. We should explore
non-lethal options first.

814
00:49:08,155 --> 00:49:09,922
For the meg or for us?

815
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:12,858
<i>Attention.</i>

816
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:15,226
I've got
an emergency locator beacon.

817
00:49:15,228 --> 00:49:16,895
20 miles south, southwest.

818
00:49:16,897 --> 00:49:18,097
What does that mean?

819
00:49:18,099 --> 00:49:19,597
It means
a boat has gone down.

820
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:21,432
<i>- Attention.</i>
- Three boats.

821
00:49:21,434 --> 00:49:25,338
That's the meg.
We need to get there. Now.

822
00:49:40,253 --> 00:49:42,890
Mac! I found something!

823
00:50:01,341 --> 00:50:03,175
These sharks have no fins.

824
00:50:03,177 --> 00:50:05,643
They were killed
by shark poachers.

825
00:50:05,645 --> 00:50:08,515
They cut off the fins and
throw the shark back to die.

826
00:50:09,582 --> 00:50:12,350
All for a bowl of soup.

827
00:50:12,352 --> 00:50:14,021
Looks like the meg
evened the score.

828
00:50:19,325 --> 00:50:20,760
One fish did all this?

829
00:50:21,996 --> 00:50:23,496
Ask it yourself.

830
00:50:26,366 --> 00:50:27,765
Okay.

831
00:50:27,767 --> 00:50:30,401
We have a shark cage
and spearguns on board.

832
00:50:30,403 --> 00:50:32,037
If we can shoot the meg

833
00:50:32,039 --> 00:50:33,806
in a soft spot
like it's mouth or gills,

834
00:50:33,808 --> 00:50:35,908
we can inject it
with something lethal.

835
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:37,176
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

836
00:50:37,178 --> 00:50:38,911
It's gonna take at least
20 minutes to rig the cage.

837
00:50:38,913 --> 00:50:40,611
And that thing
will be gone in two.

838
00:50:40,613 --> 00:50:42,348
Why don't you just
put a tracker on it?

839
00:50:44,684 --> 00:50:46,350
Don't you guys
ever watch <i>Shark Week?</i>

840
00:50:46,352 --> 00:50:51,156
You have one of those, like,
GPS tracker tag thingamajigs.

841
00:50:51,158 --> 00:50:53,125
Keep an eye on the shark
till the cage is ready.

842
00:50:53,127 --> 00:50:55,093
We should be able
to put a tracking dart

843
00:50:55,095 --> 00:50:56,228
in that dorsal fin.

844
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:57,328
You're welcome.

845
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:58,964
Yeah, but somehow

846
00:50:58,966 --> 00:51:00,531
we have to get this boat
next to that meg.

847
00:51:00,533 --> 00:51:02,201
No, we can't.

848
00:51:02,203 --> 00:51:04,937
It's already proven
aggressive towards boats.

849
00:51:04,939 --> 00:51:07,272
The safest way to approach
is without a vehicle.

850
00:51:07,274 --> 00:51:08,439
Hold up. Hold up.

851
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:09,942
You want someone
to swim out there?

852
00:51:09,944 --> 00:51:12,610
To a prehistoric shark
that ate our friend?

853
00:51:12,612 --> 00:51:15,080
Actually, one of us alone
in the water is no threat.

854
00:51:15,082 --> 00:51:17,717
Okay, who the hell
is gonna make that swim?

855
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,153
Let's draw straws.

856
00:51:21,155 --> 00:51:22,722
I can't swim.

857
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:26,591
Uh...

858
00:51:26,593 --> 00:51:29,662
Sorry, my body
made me say that.

859
00:51:30,998 --> 00:51:32,933
You sure about this?

860
00:51:35,336 --> 00:51:38,136
Not really.

861
00:51:38,138 --> 00:51:40,841
If I get eaten,
you're gonna feel really bad.

862
00:51:46,814 --> 00:51:50,084
This tracker rifle
only has a 100-foot range.

863
00:51:50,818 --> 00:51:51,950
100 feet?

864
00:51:51,952 --> 00:51:53,854
Get really close
before you shoot.

865
00:51:54,855 --> 00:51:56,420
Great.

866
00:51:56,422 --> 00:51:58,522
If you want me
to go instead, I will.

867
00:51:58,524 --> 00:52:00,359
I got this, Mac.

868
00:52:00,361 --> 00:52:02,160
Okay, good,
'cause I was lying.

869
00:52:02,162 --> 00:52:03,461
Be safe.

870
00:52:03,463 --> 00:52:04,965
Yeah, thanks, pal.

871
00:52:08,035 --> 00:52:10,004
I hope you're right
about this.

872
00:52:10,938 --> 00:52:12,172
Me, too.

873
00:52:24,151 --> 00:52:25,853
I'm an idiot.

874
00:52:37,697 --> 00:52:41,366
I am proceeding to
the enormous killer shark.

875
00:52:41,368 --> 00:52:43,135
Yeah, we got you, Jonas.

876
00:52:43,137 --> 00:52:46,171
<i>Sharks are
attracted to panic motion.</i>

877
00:52:46,173 --> 00:52:47,975
<i>Keep it nice and smooth.</i>

878
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:00,187
It's all gonna be fine.

879
00:53:06,592 --> 00:53:08,860
<i>♪ Just keep swimming</i>

880
00:53:08,862 --> 00:53:11,462
<i>♪ Just keep swimming</i>

881
00:53:11,464 --> 00:53:13,832
<i>♪ Swimming, swimming</i>

882
00:53:13,834 --> 00:53:15,970
<i>♪ Just keep swimming</i>

883
00:53:21,976 --> 00:53:24,677
Oh, boy,
it's going under.

884
00:54:24,171 --> 00:54:25,370
He's done it.

885
00:54:25,372 --> 00:54:27,005
Mac, tracker is live!

886
00:54:27,007 --> 00:54:28,275
Great!
Reel him in, DJ.

887
00:54:35,315 --> 00:54:36,381
Stop! Stop!

888
00:54:36,383 --> 00:54:38,152
No vibration!

889
00:54:39,953 --> 00:54:42,521
Oh, shit. I'm in trouble.

890
00:54:42,523 --> 00:54:43,889
Jonas, it's coming at you.

891
00:54:43,891 --> 00:54:46,525
You think I didn't notice?

892
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,995
Start the boat!
Start the boat!

893
00:54:54,268 --> 00:54:56,036
Pull him in.

894
00:55:12,086 --> 00:55:14,321
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on!

895
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,940
You might be
a son of a bitch,

896
00:55:34,942 --> 00:55:36,810
but you're sure as hell
no coward.

897
00:55:37,277 --> 00:55:38,609
Good job.

898
00:55:53,927 --> 00:55:57,796
I prepared the spearheads
to inject etorphine.

899
00:55:57,798 --> 00:56:00,664
A killer whale is knocked
out with 10 CCs.

900
00:56:00,666 --> 00:56:03,301
Dead with 20.
What do you think?

901
00:56:03,303 --> 00:56:06,039
I think we use
the whole damn bottle.

902
00:56:07,441 --> 00:56:10,708
Remind me again
why this is a good idea.

903
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:12,978
What?
It's a shark cage.

904
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:14,980
Plastic shark cage.

905
00:56:14,982 --> 00:56:17,449
I'm gonna ignore
that you just said that.

906
00:56:17,451 --> 00:56:19,885
This beautiful thing
is polycarbonate,

907
00:56:19,887 --> 00:56:22,521
specifically designed
not to crack,

908
00:56:22,523 --> 00:56:25,056
not to break, but to deform.

909
00:56:25,058 --> 00:56:27,025
And in this case,
at this thickness,

910
00:56:27,027 --> 00:56:30,896
it would take 20,000 pounds
per square inch.

911
00:56:30,898 --> 00:56:32,898
And if you're talking
about breaking,

912
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:35,435
that's eight to nine
hundred thousand.

913
00:56:38,906 --> 00:56:40,307
I don't like it.

914
00:56:44,645 --> 00:56:46,311
Doesn't like it.

915
00:56:46,313 --> 00:56:48,015
I wouldn't get in there.

916
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:51,084
Keep it coming.

917
00:56:55,155 --> 00:56:56,823
That's good!

918
00:57:04,431 --> 00:57:05,465
Hey.

919
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,800
What did he say?

920
00:57:08,802 --> 00:57:10,635
He said, "be careful."

921
00:57:10,637 --> 00:57:12,938
That's his version
of I love you.

922
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,738
Your father has
a lot of faith in you.

923
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:17,911
I've done
hundreds of shark dives.

924
00:57:19,546 --> 00:57:21,714
Not like this.

925
00:57:22,249 --> 00:57:23,383
Yes.

926
00:57:24,084 --> 00:57:26,117
But I know shark anatomy.

927
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:27,751
And I know where this

928
00:57:27,753 --> 00:57:30,424
can penetrate through
megalodon skin.

929
00:57:32,993 --> 00:57:35,527
- Suyin, let me go instead...
- Hey.

930
00:57:35,529 --> 00:57:38,465
Don't worry about me.
Let me do what I do best.

931
00:58:24,911 --> 00:58:26,478
<i>Everything okay up there?</i>

932
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,114
<i>Just a fresh
round of chum,</i>

933
00:58:29,116 --> 00:58:32,117
so you,
you know, taste good.

934
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:34,786
<i>I'm so glad
you're looking out for me.</i>

935
00:58:34,788 --> 00:58:37,291
Thank you.
Bye-bye. Good luck.

936
00:59:03,417 --> 00:59:04,916
<i>What's happening
down there?</i>

937
00:59:04,918 --> 00:59:06,484
<i>You okay?</i>

938
00:59:06,486 --> 00:59:08,553
<i>Yeah. I'm okay.</i>

939
00:59:08,555 --> 00:59:12,125
<i>Just some teeny,
tiny eight-foot sharks.</i>

940
00:59:18,965 --> 00:59:21,399
<i>Here we go.</i>

941
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:24,502
We've got her attention.

942
00:59:24,504 --> 00:59:26,304
Suyin, it's on its way.

943
00:59:26,306 --> 00:59:27,874
- 50 meters.
- 50 meters.

944
00:59:30,844 --> 00:59:32,112
<i>30.</i>

945
00:59:33,914 --> 00:59:35,013
<i>10 meters.</i>

946
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:54,301
<i>Okay.</i>

947
00:59:55,803 --> 00:59:58,103
<i>Wow.</i>

948
00:59:58,105 --> 01:00:00,507
<i>I'm going to try
to hit it in the eye.</i>

949
01:00:02,844 --> 01:00:04,378
<i>Damn it.</i>

950
01:00:16,156 --> 01:00:17,722
Whoa! Watch it.

951
01:00:17,724 --> 01:00:19,025
Whoa! Hey!

952
01:00:29,369 --> 01:00:31,304
Oh, sh...

953
01:00:39,312 --> 01:00:41,847
<i>Yes!
The poison is in.</i>

954
01:00:41,849 --> 01:00:44,317
<i>Okay, Suyin,
hang in there.</i>

955
01:00:47,621 --> 01:00:50,121
<i>I'm trapped!
I'm in its mouth!</i>

956
01:00:50,123 --> 01:00:51,756
That cage will not break.

957
01:00:51,758 --> 01:00:55,128
<i>That's the problem.
The cage is being swallowed.</i>

958
01:01:08,843 --> 01:01:10,375
Hell, yeah!

959
01:01:20,987 --> 01:01:23,390
- Not this again.
- Oh, man. Oh, man.

960
01:01:49,851 --> 01:01:53,987
<i>New problem. My mask
is broken. I'm losing air.</i>

961
01:02:01,061 --> 01:02:02,596
Help!

962
01:02:05,999 --> 01:02:07,200
Help!

963
01:02:12,272 --> 01:02:14,074
Come on, Jaxx!

964
01:02:18,512 --> 01:02:21,047
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

965
01:02:26,553 --> 01:02:27,887
<i>No, Jonas.</i>

966
01:02:27,889 --> 01:02:30,190
<i>Go! Get back to the ship.</i>

967
01:02:30,958 --> 01:02:32,659
<i>It's not safe for you.</i>

968
01:02:35,262 --> 01:02:37,564
<i>Jonas, go back.</i>

969
01:02:38,565 --> 01:02:39,666
<i>Jonas.</i>

970
01:02:49,676 --> 01:02:51,911
<i>Jonas,
the crane's in the water!</i>

971
01:02:51,913 --> 01:02:54,214
<i>It's gonna pull her
to the bottom. Hurry!</i>

972
01:02:57,852 --> 01:02:59,785
Swing the second crane over.

973
01:02:59,787 --> 01:03:02,556
We're gonna set a trap.
Guys, I need some bait.

974
01:03:24,678 --> 01:03:26,144
Come on. Got him!

975
01:03:26,146 --> 01:03:27,681
Whoa!

976
01:04:16,396 --> 01:04:18,231
Over here!

977
01:04:20,266 --> 01:04:22,903
This way. Throw a rope.

978
01:04:24,071 --> 01:04:25,472
She's not breathing.

979
01:05:10,851 --> 01:05:12,051
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

980
01:05:12,053 --> 01:05:13,518
Take it easy.

981
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:14,855
You were dead a minute ago.

982
01:05:15,588 --> 01:05:16,924
Doctor.

983
01:05:20,928 --> 01:05:23,494
You got me out.

984
01:05:23,496 --> 01:05:25,498
It was closer
than I woulda liked.

985
01:05:26,967 --> 01:05:29,736
Can I have
a minute with Jonas?

986
01:05:31,005 --> 01:05:32,338
Sure.

987
01:05:45,218 --> 01:05:48,388
You saved me. Again.

988
01:05:49,322 --> 01:05:50,925
I prefer you alive.

989
01:05:54,761 --> 01:05:57,230
There's something
you might wanna see.

990
01:05:58,565 --> 01:06:00,264
Wow.

991
01:06:00,266 --> 01:06:01,501
Wow.

992
01:06:11,244 --> 01:06:13,578
- Hey! Look who's up.
- Hey.

993
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:16,649
- How are ya?
- I'm better. Thank you.

994
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:19,450
Jonas, get a picture of me

995
01:06:19,452 --> 01:06:21,285
with this big smelly beast.

996
01:06:21,287 --> 01:06:23,621
Okay. Wait. Here.

997
01:06:23,623 --> 01:06:24,890
Hey, you want
a proper picture,

998
01:06:24,892 --> 01:06:26,359
get your head inside.

999
01:06:27,061 --> 01:06:28,326
- Closer.
- Closer?

1000
01:06:28,328 --> 01:06:29,727
Come on. Get in.

1001
01:06:29,729 --> 01:06:30,595
Okay.

1002
01:06:30,597 --> 01:06:32,732
Ugh!

1003
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:38,636
Nice one.

1004
01:06:38,638 --> 01:06:41,305
Yo, Jonas, please tell me
you got that.

1005
01:06:41,307 --> 01:06:43,010
I got that, DJ.

1006
01:06:44,044 --> 01:06:45,376
That's not funny, man!

1007
01:06:45,378 --> 01:06:46,577
No, like seriously,
it's funny.

1008
01:06:46,579 --> 01:06:48,581
Look. Watch this.

1009
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:52,750
<i>♪ We got The Wall
in the water</i>

1010
01:06:52,752 --> 01:06:54,452
<i>♪ We got The Wall
in the water ♪</i>

1011
01:06:55,755 --> 01:06:57,055
<i>♪ We got The Wall
in the water ♪</i>

1012
01:06:57,057 --> 01:06:58,558
Hey, Suyin.

1013
01:06:59,692 --> 01:07:01,461
Look at him next to the meg.

1014
01:07:02,695 --> 01:07:06,697
Look, remember the bite marks
on the O-Level?

1015
01:07:06,699 --> 01:07:08,499
Well, how do you like that?

1016
01:07:08,501 --> 01:07:11,369
That was a serious
man vs. nature moment.

1017
01:07:11,371 --> 01:07:13,640
I'm just glad
things went our way.

1018
01:07:14,507 --> 01:07:16,409
It didn't go our way.

1019
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:18,946
Not for Toshi.

1020
01:07:20,281 --> 01:07:22,482
And not for science.

1021
01:07:23,483 --> 01:07:26,118
We did what people always do.

1022
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:29,790
Discover and then destroy.

1023
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:33,926
Ugh.

1024
01:07:33,928 --> 01:07:35,560
Hey, I will end you.

1025
01:07:35,562 --> 01:07:37,328
At least you can use this
as your dating app pic.

1026
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:38,831
Give you a little leg,
you know.

1027
01:07:38,833 --> 01:07:39,965
Yeah!

1028
01:07:39,967 --> 01:07:41,766
Oh, yeah!

1029
01:07:41,768 --> 01:07:43,369
- Jellyfish.
- Whoo-hoo!

1030
01:08:23,576 --> 01:08:25,777
Two! There's two?

1031
01:08:25,779 --> 01:08:27,480
Nobody said there were two.

1032
01:08:28,349 --> 01:08:30,315
How are there two?

1033
01:08:30,317 --> 01:08:31,716
Help me!
Get me out of this water!

1034
01:08:31,718 --> 01:08:34,152
Help! Somebody help, please!

1035
01:08:34,154 --> 01:08:35,586
Help!

1036
01:08:35,588 --> 01:08:37,055
What is wrong with you?

1037
01:08:37,057 --> 01:08:39,224
I can't... I can't swim.

1038
01:08:39,226 --> 01:08:41,126
No! Get outta here! Really?

1039
01:08:41,128 --> 01:08:42,895
Don't pull that
racist stuff on me.

1040
01:08:42,897 --> 01:08:43,929
Oh, come on, man.

1041
01:08:43,931 --> 01:08:45,596
Give me a break.
I'm not being racist.

1042
01:08:45,598 --> 01:08:49,968
You work, literally,
in the middle of the ocean.

1043
01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:51,870
This wasn't
part of the job description.

1044
01:08:51,872 --> 01:08:54,339
None of this was part
of the job description!

1045
01:08:54,341 --> 01:08:55,976
They left that part out!

1046
01:09:07,453 --> 01:09:08,719
It's time
to get some real help.

1047
01:09:08,721 --> 01:09:10,421
Yeah. Go get some help.

1048
01:09:13,027 --> 01:09:14,326
I'm quitting.

1049
01:09:14,328 --> 01:09:16,830
Mac! Give me a hand.

1050
01:09:21,701 --> 01:09:24,803
Hey, I need you
to find my location.

1051
01:09:24,805 --> 01:09:27,339
Track my sat phone.
There's a second shark.

1052
01:09:27,341 --> 01:09:28,907
Yes, two.

1053
01:09:28,909 --> 01:09:30,541
How the hell should I know?

1054
01:09:30,543 --> 01:09:32,643
Just hurry up
and get us some help.

1055
01:09:32,645 --> 01:09:33,779
Thank you, Jonas. Thank you.

1056
01:09:33,781 --> 01:09:35,047
Bring whatever
you got!

1057
01:09:35,049 --> 01:09:37,182
Just relax. Relax.

1058
01:09:37,184 --> 01:09:38,749
It's not good.

1059
01:09:38,751 --> 01:09:40,618
He needs a hospital fast.

1060
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:43,055
Let's get the doctor.
Where's Doctor Heller?

1061
01:09:44,457 --> 01:09:45,658
Jaxx?

1062
01:09:46,427 --> 01:09:48,427
Jaxx, you okay?

1063
01:09:48,429 --> 01:09:50,663
Yeah! Kind of.

1064
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,632
Jaxx...

1065
01:09:54,634 --> 01:09:56,467
We can do this.

1066
01:09:56,469 --> 01:09:58,138
Swim gently back to the boat.

1067
01:09:58,738 --> 01:10:00,640
Nice and easy.

1068
01:10:05,712 --> 01:10:07,446
Here it comes!

1069
01:10:07,448 --> 01:10:08,715
Heller!

1070
01:10:09,383 --> 01:10:11,018
We're not gonna make it.

1071
01:10:12,386 --> 01:10:13,684
Jaxx.

1072
01:10:13,686 --> 01:10:15,087
You're gonna be okay.

1073
01:10:15,089 --> 01:10:17,992
- You're a good person, Jaxx.
- Wait, what?

1074
01:10:18,691 --> 01:10:20,158
Don't look back.

1075
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:21,559
- Hey!
- No!

1076
01:10:21,561 --> 01:10:22,660
Heller, no!

1077
01:10:22,662 --> 01:10:24,096
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

1078
01:10:24,098 --> 01:10:25,831
Hey, come on!

1079
01:10:25,833 --> 01:10:28,902
Hey! Hey, come on!

1080
01:10:29,502 --> 01:10:30,703
Hey!

1081
01:10:33,207 --> 01:10:35,042
Heller!

1082
01:10:44,318 --> 01:10:46,550
Almost there.

1083
01:10:46,552 --> 01:10:48,989
- Come on.
- We got you.

1084
01:10:51,724 --> 01:10:54,625
It's okay, Jaxx.

1085
01:10:54,627 --> 01:10:56,196
You're gonna be okay.

1086
01:11:03,536 --> 01:11:08,140
Thank you, Heller, thank you.

1087
01:11:08,142 --> 01:11:10,809
What was that?
What the hell was that?

1088
01:11:10,811 --> 01:11:12,978
- Okay, come on, DJ.
- No! No!

1089
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:14,946
This is why we don't
leave the station, okay?

1090
01:11:14,948 --> 01:11:16,782
That's why you don't do that!

1091
01:11:16,784 --> 01:11:19,184
And you went down there
and you pissed it off,

1092
01:11:19,186 --> 01:11:21,953
now it's gonna come back
and kill every one of us!

1093
01:11:21,955 --> 01:11:23,422
Now what are we
supposed to do?

1094
01:11:23,424 --> 01:11:25,157
I shouldn't even be out here
in the first place.

1095
01:11:25,159 --> 01:11:28,026
Swimming in this ocean.
That one ate the other one.

1096
01:11:28,028 --> 01:11:30,095
Is another one
gonna eat this one?

1097
01:11:30,097 --> 01:11:31,999
Man, it's...

1098
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,100
It just killed Heller.

1099
01:11:35,102 --> 01:11:38,238
It killed The Wall.
It killed Toshi.

1100
01:11:40,606 --> 01:11:42,810
These are my friends, man.

1101
01:11:51,717 --> 01:11:52,918
Okay,
can I just point out

1102
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,319
that this thing is sinking?

1103
01:11:54,321 --> 01:11:55,619
What are we gonna do now?

1104
01:11:55,621 --> 01:11:56,857
Where's Mac?

1105
01:12:11,972 --> 01:12:12,973
Yes!

1106
01:12:27,488 --> 01:12:29,454
What happened to your hair?

1107
01:12:29,456 --> 01:12:30,791
What happened to your hair?

1108
01:12:31,657 --> 01:12:32,926
Touche.

1109
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:35,896
Guys!

1110
01:12:38,664 --> 01:12:40,067
That thing is the devil.

1111
01:12:41,101 --> 01:12:43,301
10 miles, it's still with us.

1112
01:12:43,303 --> 01:12:44,970
You got us?

1113
01:12:44,972 --> 01:12:47,139
The ocean. The middle
of a freaking ocean!

1114
01:12:47,141 --> 01:12:48,607
Do you think
it'd slow down the shark

1115
01:12:48,609 --> 01:12:50,944
if we threw him over?

1116
01:12:52,012 --> 01:12:54,479
You got to work on yourself.

1117
01:12:54,481 --> 01:12:55,713
Okay. Good news, guys.

1118
01:12:55,715 --> 01:12:57,151
It's payback time.

1119
01:12:58,785 --> 01:13:00,753
Oh, yeah!

1120
01:13:33,187 --> 01:13:34,619
Yes! Get some!

1121
01:13:34,621 --> 01:13:36,354
You seriously think
that a rifle

1122
01:13:36,356 --> 01:13:37,355
is gonna hurt that thing?

1123
01:13:37,357 --> 01:13:39,257
I didn't have
much notice, okay?

1124
01:13:39,259 --> 01:13:41,795
I just wanted to get it
off our backs.

1125
01:13:42,596 --> 01:13:43,795
Well done, Morris.

1126
01:13:43,797 --> 01:13:45,098
Whoo!

1127
01:15:34,975 --> 01:15:36,107
It's okay.

1128
01:15:36,109 --> 01:15:38,478
Mummy! Mummy!

1129
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:41,882
Welcome back, Mummy.

1130
01:16:30,832 --> 01:16:32,132
Come in.

1131
01:16:38,038 --> 01:16:39,473
How's Meiying?

1132
01:16:40,941 --> 01:16:42,874
She's sad.

1133
01:16:42,876 --> 01:16:45,245
And confused.

1134
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:48,048
How are you?

1135
01:16:49,851 --> 01:16:52,619
I really don't want
to accept it.

1136
01:16:55,355 --> 01:17:00,158
Sometimes things happen
that change your life forever.

1137
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:02,795
Meanwhile,
the world just keeps going.

1138
01:17:02,797 --> 01:17:07,200
You think maybe it would stop
just for a second...

1139
01:17:09,703 --> 01:17:11,569
But it doesn't.

1140
01:17:11,571 --> 01:17:13,440
How do you live with it?

1141
01:17:14,842 --> 01:17:16,076
I don't.

1142
01:17:17,043 --> 01:17:20,745
I left my two best friends
to die.

1143
01:17:20,747 --> 01:17:23,648
I think about it
all the time.

1144
01:17:23,650 --> 01:17:25,452
Every day I replay it.

1145
01:17:26,686 --> 01:17:29,354
Could I have done more?

1146
01:17:29,356 --> 01:17:32,392
It's not just about
the ones you lose.

1147
01:17:34,294 --> 01:17:38,365
It's also about
the ones you save.

1148
01:17:43,603 --> 01:17:45,405
I'm glad you're here.

1149
01:17:57,551 --> 01:18:00,518
I've informed the Chinese
government about the meg.

1150
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:03,321
As well as the authorities
in Thailand,

1151
01:18:03,323 --> 01:18:05,623
Vietnam, Indonesia,
and Australia.

1152
01:18:05,625 --> 01:18:09,795
The Chinese are sending
two destroyers to take it out.

1153
01:18:09,797 --> 01:18:12,230
So, this is now officially

1154
01:18:12,232 --> 01:18:15,001
and thankfully
out of our hands.

1155
01:18:17,704 --> 01:18:19,306
I'm closing <i>Mana One</i>

1156
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:22,607
until the meg is killed

1157
01:18:22,609 --> 01:18:26,978
and an evacuation ship is
coming here tomorrow morning.

1158
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:28,546
You damn right.

1159
01:18:28,548 --> 01:18:31,351
And finally,
I just want to say

1160
01:18:35,957 --> 01:18:39,659
I'm sorry for your losses.

1161
01:18:40,828 --> 01:18:42,629
Your friends.

1162
01:18:44,397 --> 01:18:47,067
I came here
to celebrate with you,

1163
01:18:49,436 --> 01:18:51,571
and now I'm mourning with you.

1164
01:19:05,485 --> 01:19:07,387
Thanks for saving our asses.

1165
01:19:16,730 --> 01:19:18,663
What do you got for me?

1166
01:19:18,665 --> 01:19:21,666
These are Semtex high velocity
demolition charges.

1167
01:19:21,668 --> 01:19:24,769
I had the men rig delay fuses
to give them time to sink.

1168
01:19:24,771 --> 01:19:27,340
Essentially,
they're depth charges.

1169
01:19:29,175 --> 01:19:30,708
That's right.

1170
01:19:30,710 --> 01:19:34,045
I'm not sure this is
a advisable course of action.

1171
01:19:34,047 --> 01:19:37,415
Every person that gets maimed
or killed by that thing

1172
01:19:37,417 --> 01:19:38,817
is a potential lawsuit.

1173
01:19:38,819 --> 01:19:40,320
A potential casualty.

1174
01:19:41,688 --> 01:19:44,556
Relax, bro.
It's gonna be fun.

1175
01:19:48,194 --> 01:19:51,563
- I can see your cards.
- Well, look at you two crooks.

1176
01:19:51,565 --> 01:19:52,798
Hey.

1177
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,732
How are you feeling?

1178
01:19:54,734 --> 01:19:55,767
Like I got off easy,

1179
01:19:55,769 --> 01:19:57,237
compared to
the rest of you guys.

1180
01:19:57,872 --> 01:19:59,105
Mmm.

1181
01:19:59,807 --> 01:20:01,272
What do you got up there?

1182
01:20:01,274 --> 01:20:02,473
Three kings.

1183
01:20:02,475 --> 01:20:05,743
What? Come on! Every time.

1184
01:20:05,745 --> 01:20:07,913
You owe me
a soda for that one.

1185
01:20:07,915 --> 01:20:09,714
Fine.

1186
01:20:09,716 --> 01:20:11,850
We'll square up
when you get back, okay?

1187
01:20:11,852 --> 01:20:14,619
Fine. Fine. Fine.

1188
01:20:14,621 --> 01:20:16,654
Just trying to take her mind
off things, you know.

1189
01:20:16,656 --> 01:20:18,692
She's tougher than me,
that's for sure.

1190
01:20:22,562 --> 01:20:24,629
I'm sorry
I didn't believe you.

1191
01:20:24,631 --> 01:20:27,165
Well, you didn't
call me crazy.

1192
01:20:27,167 --> 01:20:28,968
Yeah, but I didn't
call you sane.

1193
01:20:28,970 --> 01:20:32,272
Yeah, well, "sane" wasn't
a word I heard very often.

1194
01:20:34,274 --> 01:20:35,941
So, what now?

1195
01:20:35,943 --> 01:20:38,676
I don't know.
Go back to Thailand, I guess.

1196
01:20:38,678 --> 01:20:40,745
Mac told me
about you and Suyin.

1197
01:20:40,747 --> 01:20:44,582
- Nothing to tell.
- Well, maybe there could be.

1198
01:20:44,584 --> 01:20:45,884
You and Mac are unbelievable.

1199
01:20:45,886 --> 01:20:48,854
How about you just
try something new?

1200
01:20:48,856 --> 01:20:51,189
So the rest of your life
isn't a vast wasteland

1201
01:20:51,191 --> 01:20:53,959
of misery and solitude.

1202
01:20:53,961 --> 01:20:56,361
I think that's a good idea.

1203
01:20:56,363 --> 01:20:57,695
You do, huh?

1204
01:20:57,697 --> 01:20:59,564
Eight-year-olds
hear everything.

1205
01:20:59,566 --> 01:21:01,768
Jonas...

1206
01:21:05,372 --> 01:21:07,707
My mom likes you, too.

1207
01:21:12,278 --> 01:21:15,415
This is possibly
the worst moment of my life.

1208
01:21:18,351 --> 01:21:19,985
<i>Approaching target area.</i>

1209
01:21:19,987 --> 01:21:21,388
<i>I'll confirm visual.</i>

1210
01:21:23,623 --> 01:21:25,858
Let me make myself
absolutely clear.

1211
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:28,493
We are not getting within
a mile of that monster

1212
01:21:28,495 --> 01:21:30,528
until the helicopter kills it.

1213
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:32,664
<i>We have a visual
on the target.</i>

1214
01:21:32,666 --> 01:21:34,198
Stop the boat.

1215
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:35,402
Stop the boat.

1216
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:40,240
<i>Deploying
depth charges.</i>

1217
01:21:54,187 --> 01:21:55,455
We got him.

1218
01:21:57,058 --> 01:21:58,389
Hit it again.

1219
01:21:58,391 --> 01:21:59,457
<i>Sir,
there's no way possible...</i>

1220
01:21:59,459 --> 01:22:00,660
Hit it again.

1221
01:22:07,134 --> 01:22:10,401
<i>Target is dead.
Repeat, target is dead.</i>

1222
01:22:10,403 --> 01:22:12,004
Are you absolutely sure?

1223
01:22:12,006 --> 01:22:13,172
Because I'm not getting eaten

1224
01:22:13,174 --> 01:22:14,907
by some goddamn
prehistoric fish.

1225
01:22:14,909 --> 01:22:17,475
<i>Affirmative, sir.
There's, uh...</i>

1226
01:22:17,477 --> 01:22:20,244
Well, there's pieces of it
all over the place.

1227
01:22:20,246 --> 01:22:22,346
<i>Shark chunks?</i>

1228
01:22:22,348 --> 01:22:24,049
That's a good sign.

1229
01:22:24,051 --> 01:22:26,821
All right. Take us in.

1230
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:35,794
Oh!

1231
01:22:35,796 --> 01:22:37,863
Jump down there,
get me a couple of teeth.

1232
01:22:37,865 --> 01:22:38,931
Big ones for my desk.

1233
01:22:38,933 --> 01:22:41,001
- All right.
- Keep one for yourself.

1234
01:22:41,969 --> 01:22:43,570
Nice.

1235
01:22:46,539 --> 01:22:48,008
Oh, you seeing this?

1236
01:22:49,409 --> 01:22:50,643
Crazy.

1237
01:22:55,850 --> 01:22:57,650
That's sick.

1238
01:23:02,990 --> 01:23:04,357
That's weird.

1239
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:12,430
Oh, man!
Don't do that to me.

1240
01:23:12,432 --> 01:23:14,332
That thing
doesn't have any teeth.

1241
01:23:14,334 --> 01:23:15,968
What?

1242
01:23:15,970 --> 01:23:17,537
I think we killed a whale.

1243
01:23:20,607 --> 01:23:22,408
It's right below us.

1244
01:23:23,309 --> 01:23:24,577
Get us outta here!

1245
01:23:29,649 --> 01:23:32,117
Wait! Wait,
you idiots! Wait!

1246
01:23:32,119 --> 01:23:34,054
I'm over here! Wait!

1247
01:23:36,456 --> 01:23:38,758
Oh, no!

1248
01:23:59,246 --> 01:24:00,547
Oh!

1249
01:24:12,725 --> 01:24:16,329
Yeah, I understand.
I understand, yep. Thank you.

1250
01:24:18,199 --> 01:24:20,565
Let me guess,
Morris never called anyone.

1251
01:24:20,567 --> 01:24:21,834
Didn't call anyone.

1252
01:24:21,836 --> 01:24:23,501
No one knows
the shark's out there.

1253
01:24:23,503 --> 01:24:25,304
No one. Not the Australians,

1254
01:24:25,306 --> 01:24:26,637
not the Chinese. No one.

1255
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:28,140
The hell was he thinking?

1256
01:24:28,142 --> 01:24:30,575
He wanted to make this go away
as quietly as possible.

1257
01:24:30,577 --> 01:24:31,742
Mac, we need
to let everyone...

1258
01:24:31,744 --> 01:24:33,145
Let everyone know.
Yeah, I'm on it.

1259
01:24:33,147 --> 01:24:34,645
Jaxx, can you find that thing?

1260
01:24:34,647 --> 01:24:36,281
Wait, wait, wait.
Why're you asking her that?

1261
01:24:36,283 --> 01:24:38,551
I don't like the fact that you
asking her about that thing.

1262
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:40,919
You want me
to illegally hack

1263
01:24:40,921 --> 01:24:42,720
into Morris' satellite
tracking system

1264
01:24:42,722 --> 01:24:45,257
- to find a prehistoric shark?
- Yeah.

1265
01:24:45,259 --> 01:24:46,757
Okay.

1266
01:24:46,759 --> 01:24:49,194
We use a tracker,
find the meg, and we kill it.

1267
01:24:49,196 --> 01:24:50,396
Bro.

1268
01:24:52,432 --> 01:24:53,832
We really gonna do this?

1269
01:24:53,834 --> 01:24:55,733
A lot of people are gonna die
if we don't, Mac.

1270
01:24:55,735 --> 01:24:57,236
- Well, I'm in.
- Me, too.

1271
01:24:57,238 --> 01:24:59,004
Let's do this.

1272
01:24:59,006 --> 01:25:01,439
How do you feel about
commandeering that evac ship?

1273
01:25:01,441 --> 01:25:03,608
I'd say,

1274
01:25:03,610 --> 01:25:05,445
it's a great day
to go fishing.

1275
01:25:06,579 --> 01:25:07,779
Now let's get
everything on it.

1276
01:25:07,781 --> 01:25:09,747
Construction explosives,
gliders.

1277
01:25:09,749 --> 01:25:11,149
The whole lot. Everything.

1278
01:25:11,151 --> 01:25:13,185
Because we're about
to evac, right?

1279
01:25:13,187 --> 01:25:14,485
Like evacuate?

1280
01:25:14,487 --> 01:25:16,654
Like, leave the area
of imminent danger

1281
01:25:16,656 --> 01:25:20,627
and go to a safe place
like normal people?

1282
01:25:31,272 --> 01:25:32,703
What we got, Jaxx?
Anything?

1283
01:25:32,705 --> 01:25:35,406
Yeah. Here's where we saw
Morris attack the shark.

1284
01:25:35,408 --> 01:25:38,076
But here is where it's going.

1285
01:25:38,078 --> 01:25:39,543
Sanya Bay. What's there?

1286
01:25:39,545 --> 01:25:40,678
Oh, nothing.

1287
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:41,980
It only has some of the most

1288
01:25:41,982 --> 01:25:43,949
densely populated beaches
in the world.

1289
01:25:43,951 --> 01:25:45,350
Any luck with the authorities?

1290
01:25:45,352 --> 01:25:46,785
No.

1291
01:25:46,787 --> 01:25:49,187
"Prehistoric shark" sounds
like a damn prank call.

1292
01:25:49,189 --> 01:25:51,223
We can't rely on them
for anything.

1293
01:25:51,225 --> 01:25:53,225
How long until the
shark gets to those people?

1294
01:25:53,227 --> 01:25:54,425
20 minutes.

1295
01:25:54,427 --> 01:25:56,228
- Can we get there first?
- Doubtful.

1296
01:25:56,230 --> 01:25:57,561
Yeah, we're gonna have to.

1297
01:25:57,563 --> 01:25:58,696
Getting there first
won't mean anything

1298
01:25:58,698 --> 01:26:00,265
if we don't have a plan.

1299
01:26:00,267 --> 01:26:02,169
Maybe we have a plan.

1300
01:26:05,039 --> 01:26:07,705
Here's where we do it.
Right here in the shallows.

1301
01:26:07,707 --> 01:26:09,473
Use the gliders
and go after it.

1302
01:26:09,475 --> 01:26:11,410
Okay, so, how are we
gonna get it here,

1303
01:26:11,412 --> 01:26:14,179
when there's a beach full
of people to eat right here?

1304
01:26:14,181 --> 01:26:16,616
You ask it out for dinner.

1305
01:26:28,829 --> 01:26:31,497
So...
How do you wanna do this?

1306
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:33,934
Is that you asking my opinion?

1307
01:26:34,567 --> 01:26:35,766
No.

1308
01:26:35,768 --> 01:26:37,369
I was just being polite

1309
01:26:37,371 --> 01:26:40,604
before telling you
what we're actually doing,

1310
01:26:40,606 --> 01:26:42,374
so you feel
better about yourself.

1311
01:26:42,376 --> 01:26:43,743
Appreciate that.

1312
01:26:50,951 --> 01:26:51,952
What?

1313
01:26:52,419 --> 01:26:54,086
Nothing.

1314
01:26:54,088 --> 01:26:55,155
We're ready.

1315
01:28:18,072 --> 01:28:20,238
Pippin!

1316
01:29:46,426 --> 01:29:47,928
Oh, my God!

1317
01:29:59,239 --> 01:30:01,173
We're close enough.
Stop here.

1318
01:30:01,175 --> 01:30:03,408
Jaxx, DJ, we gotta get
that thing in the water.

1319
01:30:03,410 --> 01:30:04,444
Yeah, we're on it.

1320
01:31:01,401 --> 01:31:05,105
Shark! Shark!

1321
01:33:10,397 --> 01:33:12,530
<i>Any last
thoughts about our plan?</i>

1322
01:33:12,532 --> 01:33:14,599
Not dying
would be a good start.

1323
01:33:14,601 --> 01:33:17,068
Finally,
we agree on something.

1324
01:33:17,070 --> 01:33:19,304
<i>Let's not make it a habit.</i>

1325
01:33:19,306 --> 01:33:21,108
<i>Suyin, look out!
Get out of there!</i>

1326
01:33:32,052 --> 01:33:33,551
- Damn it!
- What's wrong, Jonas?

1327
01:33:33,553 --> 01:33:36,089
Can't make the shot.
It's too close to the ship.

1328
01:33:37,457 --> 01:33:38,492
Jesus!

1329
01:33:40,862 --> 01:33:42,460
<i>Jonas, it's on you.</i>

1330
01:33:42,462 --> 01:33:43,497
Mac!

1331
01:33:46,868 --> 01:33:48,366
Jonas, what's going on
down there?

1332
01:33:48,368 --> 01:33:50,370
Trying to stay
out of its mouth.

1333
01:34:12,025 --> 01:34:13,226
Jeez!

1334
01:34:21,067 --> 01:34:22,335
Oops.

1335
01:34:24,204 --> 01:34:25,770
<i>Suyin, are you set?
I'm coming to you.</i>

1336
01:34:25,772 --> 01:34:27,472
I'm in position.

1337
01:34:27,474 --> 01:34:28,908
<i>Shark's getting close.</i>

1338
01:34:28,910 --> 01:34:30,610
I need a little
breathing room.

1339
01:34:36,918 --> 01:34:39,286
- I'm ready to fire.
<i>- Take the shot.</i>

1340
01:34:41,087 --> 01:34:42,322
<i>Move! Move!</i>

1341
01:35:03,176 --> 01:35:05,477
Anybody see it?

1342
01:35:05,479 --> 01:35:07,245
<i>Can't see the shark, but
something's going on up here.</i>

1343
01:35:17,390 --> 01:35:19,726
<i>Okay,
I've got her attention.</i>

1344
01:35:22,996 --> 01:35:24,197
Bring her to me.

1345
01:35:24,799 --> 01:35:26,066
Here we come.

1346
01:35:29,035 --> 01:35:31,071
Make your move, Suyin.

1347
01:35:34,474 --> 01:35:36,710
Chew on this,
you ugly bastard.

1348
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,782
No, no, no! Shit!

1349
01:35:43,885 --> 01:35:45,085
Jeez!

1350
01:36:09,609 --> 01:36:12,445
No, no, no. Go! Go! Go!

1351
01:36:24,124 --> 01:36:26,291
- Where's DJ?
- I don't know.

1352
01:36:26,293 --> 01:36:27,659
- Where's Meiying?
- I don't know!

1353
01:36:27,661 --> 01:36:29,795
- <i>I couldn't see her anywhere.</i>
- Jonas.

1354
01:36:29,797 --> 01:36:31,765
- <i>Sorry, I...</i>
- Go, go. Take care of Meiying.

1355
01:36:39,539 --> 01:36:40,839
Jonas!

1356
01:36:40,841 --> 01:36:43,310
<i>I'm okay. I'm leading
it away from the ship.</i>

1357
01:36:46,580 --> 01:36:50,049
- Oh, my God! Gotta get...
- Stop splashing!

1358
01:36:50,051 --> 01:36:52,250
You have a life jacket on!

1359
01:36:52,252 --> 01:36:54,285
- A life jacket?
- Yep.

1360
01:36:54,287 --> 01:36:56,421
Oh, yeah.
I've got a life jacket on.

1361
01:36:56,423 --> 01:36:58,425
It's right here. I can...

1362
01:36:59,125 --> 01:37:00,859
The monster's here.

1363
01:37:00,861 --> 01:37:02,293
The monster's here?

1364
01:37:02,295 --> 01:37:03,528
No, don't worry
about the monster, I got you.

1365
01:37:03,530 --> 01:37:05,833
- Everything's fine.
- Stop talking.

1366
01:37:10,037 --> 01:37:11,235
Meiying!

1367
01:37:11,237 --> 01:37:13,338
Mummy! It's you!

1368
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:15,740
That's good! Wait! Wait!
Wait for me.

1369
01:37:15,742 --> 01:37:18,276
Wait for DJ,
wait for DJ. Yeah.

1370
01:37:18,278 --> 01:37:19,546
- Yes.
- Come on.

1371
01:37:20,948 --> 01:37:22,883
Mummy, are you okay?

1372
01:37:24,785 --> 01:37:26,284
I'm okay.

1373
01:37:26,286 --> 01:37:28,421
I'm okay, too.

1374
01:37:31,358 --> 01:37:32,559
Come on. Come up!

1375
01:37:34,427 --> 01:37:36,895
- Meiying, be careful.
- Jonas!

1376
01:37:36,897 --> 01:37:38,864
Careful! Careful!

1377
01:37:38,866 --> 01:37:40,833
- There it is.
- Oh, my God.

1378
01:37:40,835 --> 01:37:42,333
Jonas!

1379
01:37:42,335 --> 01:37:43,601
It's coming.

1380
01:37:43,603 --> 01:37:44,903
We're sitting ducks
up here, Jonas.

1381
01:37:44,905 --> 01:37:46,604
<i>- Mummy!</i>
<i>- It's coming.</i>

1382
01:37:46,606 --> 01:37:48,473
<i>- Can you hear me, Jonas?</i>
<i>- Meiying, hold on.</i>

1383
01:37:48,475 --> 01:37:50,208
<i>Suyin, we're gonna
have to go. Through here.</i>

1384
01:37:50,210 --> 01:37:52,710
Jonas, we've got nothing left.

1385
01:37:52,712 --> 01:37:54,379
Almost nothing.

1386
01:37:54,381 --> 01:37:56,048
How're you gonna kill it?

1387
01:37:56,050 --> 01:37:57,248
<i>Evolution.</i>

1388
01:37:57,250 --> 01:37:59,517
I'm gonna
make this thing bleed.

1389
01:37:59,519 --> 01:38:01,787
<i>Suyin, what you said before,
you were right.</i>

1390
01:38:01,789 --> 01:38:03,690
It's not about
the people you lose.

1391
01:38:05,826 --> 01:38:07,895
<i>It's about the people
you save.</i>

1392
01:38:09,596 --> 01:38:11,331
- Signing off.
<i>- Jonas!</i>

1393
01:38:18,371 --> 01:38:19,539
Here we go.

1394
01:38:26,479 --> 01:38:28,849
How do you like that? Bleed!

1395
01:38:37,490 --> 01:38:38,893
Come on, come on, come on.

1396
01:38:49,103 --> 01:38:50,169
Come on.

1397
01:40:45,286 --> 01:40:46,519
Hey!

1398
01:40:47,021 --> 01:40:48,055
Hey!

1399
01:40:52,392 --> 01:40:53,593
Yes!

1400
01:41:21,889 --> 01:41:22,890
Thank you.

1401
01:41:26,759 --> 01:41:28,526
Beep-beep!
Coming through, Crazy.

1402
01:41:28,528 --> 01:41:29,964
- Hi.
- Look who it is.

1403
01:41:33,466 --> 01:41:34,632
Well,

1404
01:41:34,634 --> 01:41:36,971
here's to being alive.

1405
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:41,976
And to our friends.

1406
01:41:48,448 --> 01:41:49,649
Cheers!

1407
01:41:53,686 --> 01:41:55,486
I don't know about you.

1408
01:41:55,488 --> 01:41:58,489
But, uh,
I could use a vacation.

1409
01:41:58,491 --> 01:42:00,027
Shall we ask my mum?
