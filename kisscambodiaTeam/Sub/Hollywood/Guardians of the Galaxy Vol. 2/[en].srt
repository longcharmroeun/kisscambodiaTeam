1
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:10,282
There's a girl in this harbor town

2
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,485
And she works layin' whiskey down

3
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:17,906
They say,
"Brandy, fetch another round"

4
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,118
And she serves them
whiskey and wine

5
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,250
The sailors say
"Brandy, you're a fine girl"

6
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:29,259
"What a good wife you would be"

7
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:42,099
- Come on!
- Slow down!

8
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,269
This way, my river lily! Come on!

9
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,315
Where are you taking me?

10
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,483
Come on, come on.

11
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,780
Look. Look!

12
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,855
Oh, it's beautiful!

13
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,121
I was afraid
it wouldn't take to the soil...

14
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,533
but it rooted quickly.

15
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,371
And soon, it'll be everywhere.

16
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,537
All across the universe.

17
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,885
Well, I don't know what
you're talking about...

18
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,674
but I like the way you say it.

19
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,589
My heart is yours...

20
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,342
Meredith Quill.

21
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:17,756
I can't believe I fell in love
with a spaceman.

22
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,530
Showtime, a-holes!

23
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,455
It will be here any minute.

24
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,412
Which will be its loss.

25
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:19,073
I thought your thing was a sword?

26
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,321
We've been hired
to stop an interdimensional beast...

27
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,131
from feeding on those batteries,
and I'm gonna stop it with a sword?

28
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,409
It's just, swords were your thing
and guns were mine.

29
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,250
But I guess we're both doing guns now.
I just didn't know that.

30
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:32,748
Drax, why aren't you wearing
one of Rocket's aero-rigs?

31
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,261
It hurts.

32
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:35,423
It hurts?

33
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,589
I have sensitive nipples.

34
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,348
"My nipples hurt! Oh, goodness me!"

35
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,104
What about him? What's he doing?

36
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,766
I'm finishing this so we can listen to
tunes while we work.

37
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,185
How is that a priority?

38
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,733
Blame Quill. He's the one
who loves music so much.

39
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,458
No, I actually agree with Drax on this.

40
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,028
That's hardly important right now.

41
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,573
Okay. Sure, Quill.

42
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,657
No, seriously, I side with Drax.

43
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:03,163
No, I understand that.
You're being very serious right now.

44
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,504
I can clearly see you winking.

45
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,077
Damn it. I'm using my left eye?

46
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,261
I am Groot.

47
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,552
They were not looking at you funny.

48
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:23,934
Well, that's intense.

49
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:27,243
Groot!

50
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,933
Groot, get out of the way!
You're gonna get hurt!

51
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,095
Hi.

52
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,805
No! Spit it out!

53
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,144
Come on!

54
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,555
Disgusting!

55
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,040
The beast's hide is too thick
to be pierced from the outside.

56
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,385
I must cut through it from the inside.

57
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:44,547
Huh?

58
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,050
No, no! Drax, wait a minute!

59
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,217
Drax!

60
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,226
What is he doing?

61
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:02,226
He said the skin is too thick
to be pierced from the outside, so he...

62
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,252
- That doesn't make any sense!
- I tried telling him that!

63
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,880
Skin is the same level of thickness
from the inside as from the outside!

64
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,614
I realize that.

65
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,412
There is a cut on its neck.

66
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,788
Rocket, get it to look up.

67
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,881
Hey, you giant Sea-Monkey! Up here!

68
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,104
Watch it, Quill!

69
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,976
Yes! I have single-handedly...

70
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,269
vanquished the beast!

71
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,476
What?

72
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,834
What are they called again?

73
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,658
Anulax batteries.

74
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:43,041
Harbulary batteries.

75
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,498
That's nothing like what I just said.

76
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,469
But they're worth
thousands of units apiece...

77
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,666
which is why the Sovereign hired us
to protect them.

78
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,220
Careful what you say around these
folks. They're easily offended.

79
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,175
The cost of transgression is death.

80
00:09:56,513 --> 00:10:00,523
We thank you, Guardians,
for putting your lives on the line.

81
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:04,694
We could not risk the lives
of our own Sovereign citizens.

82
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:09,362
Every citizen is born
exactly as designed by the community.

83
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,696
Impeccable, both physically
and mentally.

84
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,033
We control the DNA of our progeny...

85
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:17,529
germinating them in birthing pods.

86
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:21,201
I guess I prefer to make people
the old-fashioned way.

87
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:24,866
Perhaps someday, you could give me
a history lesson...

88
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,545
in the archaic ways of our ancestors.

89
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,842
For academic purposes.

90
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:32,796
I would be honored, yes.

91
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,966
In the name of research...

92
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,635
I think that could be pretty...

93
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,064
repulsive.

94
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,350
I'm not into that kind of casual...

95
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:42,557
Oh, please.

96
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:46,016
Your people promised something
in exchange for our services.

97
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:47,478
Bring it...

98
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,228
and we shall gladly
be on our way.

99
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:05,585
Family reunion. Yay.

100
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:08,249
I understand she is your sister.

101
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:12,708
She's worth no more to me
than the bounty due for her on Xandar.

102
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:17,260
Our soldiers apprehended her
attempting to steal the batteries.

103
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:20,182
Do with her as you please.

104
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,444
We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.

105
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,444
What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?

106
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,233
My mother is from Earth.

107
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,275
And your father?

108
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,780
He ain't from Missouri.
That's all I know.

109
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,450
I see it within you.

110
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:45,122
An unorthodox genealogy.

111
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:49,499
A hybrid that seems particularly...

112
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,090
reckless.

113
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:56,128
You know, they told me you people
were conceited douchebags...

114
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:58,926
but that isn't true at all.

115
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:04,814
Oh, shit.

116
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,985
I'm using my wrong eye again,
aren't I?

117
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,524
I'm sorry. That was meant to be
behind your back.

118
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,243
Count yourself blessed
they didn't kill you.

119
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,108
You're telling me.

120
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,487
You wanna buy some batteries?

121
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:33,166
All right, let's get baldy to Xandar
and collect that bounty.

122
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:27,559
That stuff about my father...

123
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,734
Who does she think she is?

124
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:32,193
I know you're sensitive about that.

125
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,554
I'm not sensitive about it.
I just don't know who he is.

126
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:39,243
Sorry if it seemed like
I was flirting with the High Priestess.

127
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,950
I wasn't.

128
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:43,243
I don't care if you were.

129
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:45,197
Well, I feel like you do care.

130
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:47,737
That's why I'm apologizing. So, sorry!

131
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:50,081
Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.

132
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,044
Damn shadow.

133
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,251
There are two types of beings
in the universe...

134
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,128
those who dance, and those who do not.

135
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,255
Mm-hmm.

136
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,423
I first met my beloved at a war rally.

137
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:01,421
Oh, God.

138
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:04,552
Everyone in the village flailed about,
dancing.

139
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,390
Except one woman.

140
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,098
My Ovette.

141
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:11,061
I knew immediately
she was the one for me.

142
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,766
The most melodic song in the world
could be playing.

143
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:16,613
She wouldn't even tap her foot.

144
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:19,571
Wouldn't move a muscle.

145
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:22,455
One might assume she was dead.

146
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:24,073
That does sound pretty hot.

147
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:27,245
It would
make my nether regions engorge.

148
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:29,289
Okay. I get it, yes.

149
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,253
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.

150
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:35,083
You just need to find a woman
who is pathetic... like you.

151
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:43,304
I'm hungry.
Hand me some of that yaro root.

152
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:44,967
No. It's not ripe yet...

153
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,135
and I hate you.

154
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:47,513
You hate me?

155
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,349
You left me there
while you stole that stone for yourself.

156
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:52,676
And yet here you stand, a hero.

157
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,691
I will be free of these shackles
soon enough, and I will kill you.

158
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:57,356
I swear.

159
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:58,653
No.

160
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,185
You're gonna live out the rest of
your days in a prison on Xandar...

161
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:03,781
wishing you could.

162
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:11,661
This is weird.

163
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,681
We've got a Sovereign
fleet approaching from the rear.

164
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:14,705
Why would they do that?

165
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,643
Probably because Rocket stole
some of their batteries.

166
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:17,667
Dude!

167
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:18,998
Right.

168
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:20,369
He didn't steal some of those.

169
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:22,785
I don't know why they're after us.
What a mystery this is.

170
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,190
What were you thinking?

171
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:36,788
Dude, they were really easy to steal!

172
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:38,192
- That's your defense?
- Come on!

173
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,685
You saw how that High Priestess
talked down to us.

174
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:42,528
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!

175
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,900
I didn't realize your motivation
was altruism.

176
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:48,671
It's really a shame the Sovereign
have mistaken your intentions...

177
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,379
- and they're trying to kill us.
- Exactly!

178
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:52,164
I was being sarcastic!

179
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:53,367
Oh, no!

180
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:55,937
You're supposed to use
a sarcastic voice! Now I look foolish!

181
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:57,648
Can we put the bickering on hold...

182
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,708
until after we survive
this massive space battle?

183
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:01,537
- More incoming!
- Good!

184
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:03,212
I wanna kill some guys!

185
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,394
You're not killing anyone.

186
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:14,266
All those ships are remotely piloted.

187
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:18,686
Damn it!

188
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:31,201
What is the delay, Admiral?

189
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:35,406
High Priestess, the batteries, they are
exceptionally combustible...

190
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:36,890
and could destroy the entire fleet.

191
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:39,624
Our concern is their slight
against our people.

192
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,455
We hired them and they steal from us.

193
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:46,088
It is heresy of the highest order.

194
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:49,975
All command modules...

195
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:52,715
fire with the intent to kill.

196
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,935
What's the nearest habitable planet?

197
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:06,282
It's called Berhert.

198
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,073
- How many jumps?
- Only one.

199
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:11,317
But the access point is 47 clicks away.

200
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,330
And you have to go through
that quantum asteroid field.

201
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,072
Quill, to make it through that...

202
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:26,940
you'd have to be the greatest pilot
in the universe.

203
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:27,964
Lucky for us, I...

204
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,631
I am.

205
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:43,152
What are you doing?

206
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,323
I've been flying this rig
since I was 10 years old.

207
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:48,532
I was cybernetically engineered
to pilot a spacecraft.

208
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:51,324
You were cybernetically engineered
to be a douchebag!

209
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:52,822
Stop it.

210
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,801
Later on tonight, you're gonna be
laying down in your bed...

211
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:56,970
and there's gonna be something
squishy in your pillow case.

212
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:58,513
And you're gonna be like,
"What's this?"

213
00:17:58,537 --> 00:18:00,417
And it's gonna be because
I put a turd in there!

214
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:04,209
You put your turd in my bed,
I shave you.

215
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:05,786
It won't be my turd.

216
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:07,341
It will be Drax's.

217
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,800
I have famously huge turds.

218
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:14,337
We're about to die,
and this is what we're discussing?

219
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:18,014
Son of a...

220
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:19,642
Dude! Seriously!

221
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,350
Hey! Let me...

222
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,029
Idiots!

223
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:39,081
Well, that's what you get
when Quill flies.

224
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,828
We still have a Sovereign
craft behind us.

225
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,498
Our weapons are down.

226
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,710
20 clicks to the jump!

227
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:54,884
Hold on.

228
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,233
It's not ripe.

229
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:17,242
Come on, Zylak. You can do this.

230
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:22,544
Yes!

231
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:25,712
15 clicks to the jump!

232
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,254
Come on!

233
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:29,593
Keep going!

234
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:45,019
10 clicks!

235
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,355
Die, spaceship!

236
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,453
You suck, Zylak.

237
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:57,613
Typical.

238
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:01,367
Five clicks!

239
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:08,674
Son of a...

240
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:10,996
They went around the field!

241
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:27,639
Someone destroyed all our ships!

242
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:29,021
What?

243
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:33,685
Who?

244
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,071
One click!

245
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,987
- What is that?
- Who cares?

246
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:40,526
That's the jump point! Go!

247
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:46,003
It's a guy.

248
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,000
Oh, my God.

249
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:55,551
He's still out there?

250
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,829
Groot, put your seatbelt on!

251
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:27,999
Prepare for a really bad landing!

252
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,580
That was awesome!

253
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:13,082
Yes!

254
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:16,417
Look at this!

255
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:18,761
Where is the other half of our ship?

256
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:19,922
My ship.

257
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:23,720
Either one of you could have gotten us
through that field... Had you flown

258
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:26,756
with what's between your ears
instead of what's between your legs!

259
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:30,177
If what's between my legs
had a hand on it...

260
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,480
I guarantee I could have landed
this ship with it.

261
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:35,415
Peter, we almost died
because of your arrogance.

262
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:37,069
More like because he stole...

263
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:38,442
the Anulax batteries!

264
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:40,779
They're called Harbulary batteries.

265
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:42,454
No, they're not!

266
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:44,489
Do you know why I did it, Star-Munch?

267
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,720
I'm not gonna answer to "Star-Munch."

268
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:48,703
I did it because I wanted to!

269
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:49,619
Dick.

270
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,576
What are we even
talking about this for?

271
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:54,367
We just had a little man save us
by blowing up 50 ships!

272
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:55,541
How little?

273
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:57,464
Well, I don't know, like this?

274
00:22:57,878 --> 00:22:59,458
A little one-inch man saved us?

275
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,870
Well, if he got closer,
I'm sure he would be much larger.

276
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:04,297
That's how eyesight works,
you stupid raccoon.

277
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:05,888
Don't call me a raccoon!

278
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:08,681
I'm sorry. I took it too far.

279
00:23:09,515 --> 00:23:10,855
I meant trash panda.

280
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:14,393
Is that better?

281
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:16,563
I don't know.

282
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,940
It's worse. It's so much worse.

283
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:20,397
You son of a...

284
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:21,277
Hey!

285
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:22,879
- I've had it with you!
- No! Back up!

286
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:24,653
Someone followed you through
the jump point.

287
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:28,912
Set me free, you'll need my help.

288
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:30,156
I'm not a fool, Nebula.

289
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:32,388
You are a fool if you deprive yourself
a hand in combat.

290
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:33,723
You'll attack me
the moment I let you go.

291
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:34,747
No, I won't.

292
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:38,135
You'd think an evil supervillain
would learn how to properly lie.

293
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:40,383
I bet it's the one-inch man.

294
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:16,044
After all these years, I've found you.

295
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:18,498
And who the hell are you?

296
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:22,503
I figured my rugged good looks
would make that obvious.

297
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,879
My name is Ego...

298
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:28,761
and I'm your dad, Peter.

299
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:46,702
You know what they say...

300
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:49,822
"You're out of luck
until you've gone duck."

301
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:17,978
Yondu!

302
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:20,685
Come on down!

303
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:34,494
After going around years in circles...

304
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,450
with this woman I end up marrying.

305
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,330
I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl...

306
00:25:39,498 --> 00:25:40,918
"but you're losing your mind!"

307
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:43,043
Then again, she's always
been that way.

308
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,960
I could never trust her. You know?

309
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:46,208
Stakar.

310
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:52,184
It's been some time.

311
00:25:56,223 --> 00:26:00,233
It seems like this establishment
is the wrong kind of disreputable.

312
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:07,285
- Sir!
- Stakar!

313
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:09,782
There's a hundred Ravager factions.

314
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:12,995
You lost the business of 99 of them
by serving one.

315
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:14,656
Please, sir. Please!

316
00:26:14,825 --> 00:26:16,205
Get away from me.

317
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:24,328
You can go to hell then!

318
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:26,751
I don't give a damn
what you think of me!

319
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:28,877
So what are you following us for?

320
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:30,525
Because you're gonna listen to
what I gotta say!

321
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:33,339
I don't gotta listen to nothing!
You betrayed the code!

322
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,350
Ravagers don't deal in kids.

323
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:38,432
I told you before!
I didn't know what was going on!

324
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:41,244
You didn't know because you didn't
want to know because it made you rich.

325
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:45,608
I demand a seat at the table!
I wear these flames, same as you.

326
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:47,862
You may dress like us...

327
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:50,535
but you'll never hear the Horns
of Freedom when you die, Yondu.

328
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:52,534
And the Colors of Ogord...

329
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:56,116
will never flash over your grave.

330
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:58,699
If you think...

331
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:03,040
I take pleasure in exiling you...

332
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,541
you're wrong.

333
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:10,631
You broke all our hearts.

334
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:27,563
Pathetic.

335
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:30,732
First, Quill betrays us...

336
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:34,151
and Yondu just lets him go scot-free.

337
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:37,452
We followed him
because he was the one...

338
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:40,116
who wasn't afraid
to do what needed to be done.

339
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:42,615
Seems he's goin' soft.

340
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,580
If he's so soft,
why are you whispering?

341
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:47,996
You know I'm right, Kraglin.

342
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:52,588
You best be very careful
what you say about our captain.

343
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:54,256
Who the hell is that?

344
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:36,049
Yondu Udonta...

345
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:38,893
I have a proposition for you.

346
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:41,506
I hired Yondu to pick you up...

347
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,720
when your mother passed away.

348
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:45,731
But instead of returning you...

349
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:47,643
Yondu kept you.

350
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:50,521
I have no clue as to why.

351
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:52,983
Well, I'll tell you why.

352
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,190
Because I was a
skinny little kid who

353
00:28:55,277 --> 00:28:56,337
could squeeze into
places adults couldn't.

354
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:57,821
It made it easier for thievin'.

355
00:28:57,988 --> 00:29:01,318
Well, I've been trying to track you down
ever since.

356
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,449
I thought Yondu was your father.

357
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:05,659
What? We've been together
this whole time...

358
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:08,619
and you thought Yondu
was my actual blood relative?

359
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,000
You look exactly alike.

360
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:11,837
One's blue!

361
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:15,132
No, he's not my father!

362
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:17,717
Yondu was the guy who abducted me...

363
00:29:17,883 --> 00:29:19,819
kicked the crap out of me
so I could learn to fight...

364
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:21,893
and kept me in terror by
threatening to eat me.

365
00:29:22,054 --> 00:29:23,354
- Eat you?
- Yeah.

366
00:29:23,514 --> 00:29:25,644
That son of a bitch.

367
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,177
How'd you locate us now?

368
00:29:27,893 --> 00:29:30,903
Even where I reside,
out past the edge of what's known...

369
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:33,573
we've heard tell about the man
they call Star-Lord.

370
00:29:33,732 --> 00:29:36,032
What say we head out there right now?

371
00:29:36,193 --> 00:29:38,833
Your associates are welcome.
Even that triangle-faced monkey there.

372
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:40,906
I promise you...

373
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,490
it's unlike any other place
you've ever seen.

374
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:45,371
And there...

375
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:49,659
I can explain
your very special heritage.

376
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:52,714
Finally get to be...

377
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:55,546
the father I've always wanted to be.

378
00:29:57,047 --> 00:29:58,547
Excuse me.

379
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:00,379
I've gotta take a whiz.

380
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:08,387
I'm not buying it.

381
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:12,231
Let's go take a walk.

382
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:20,452
I am Mantis.

383
00:30:24,241 --> 00:30:25,741
What are you doing?

384
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:27,289
Smiling.

385
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,620
I hear it is the thing to do
to make people like you.

386
00:30:31,707 --> 00:30:33,747
Not if you do it like that.

387
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:38,049
I was raised alone on Ego's planet.

388
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:42,933
I do not understand
the intricacies of social interaction.

389
00:30:45,262 --> 00:30:48,892
Can I pet your puppy?
It is adorable.

390
00:30:51,727 --> 00:30:52,767
Yes.

391
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:05,777
That is called a practical joke!

392
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:11,082
I liked it very much!

393
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:12,906
I just made it up!

394
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:16,918
Give me a break!

395
00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:20,106
After all this time, you're gonna
show up, and all of a sudden...

396
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,970
- you wanna be my dad?
- I hear you.

397
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:24,132
And by the way, this could be a trap.

398
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:25,841
The Kree purists, the Ravagers...

399
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:27,681
- they all want us dead.
- I know, but...

400
00:31:27,846 --> 00:31:28,846
But what?

401
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:31,432
What was that story you told me
about Zardu Hasselfrau?

402
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
Who?

403
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:33,984
He owned a magic boat?

404
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:37,148
David Hasselhoff?

405
00:31:37,314 --> 00:31:38,314
Right.

406
00:31:38,357 --> 00:31:40,437
Not a magic boat. A talking car.

407
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:41,649
Why did he talk again?

408
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:45,278
To help him fight crime,
and to be supportive.

409
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:47,987
As a child, you would carry his picture
in your pocket...

410
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:49,878
and you would tell
all the other children...

411
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:52,155
that he was your father,
but that he was out of town.

412
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:54,869
Shooting Knight Rider
or touring with his band in Germany.

413
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,519
I told you that when I was drunk.
Why are you bringing that up now?

414
00:31:57,543 --> 00:31:58,543
I love that story.

415
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,670
I hate that story.

416
00:32:00,838 --> 00:32:02,378
It's so sad!

417
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:07,553
As a kid, I used to see all the other kids
off playing catch with their dad.

418
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:10,389
And I wanted that,
more than anything in the world!

419
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:12,849
That's my point, Peter.

420
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:16,564
What if this man is your Hasselhoff?

421
00:32:19,982 --> 00:32:21,522
If he ends up being evil...

422
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:24,531
we will just kill him.

423
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:34,084
You're leaving me with that fox?

424
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:35,406
He's not a fox.

425
00:32:35,581 --> 00:32:37,581
Shoot her
if she does anything suspicious.

426
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:41,037
- Or if you feel like it.
- Okay.

427
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:44,592
It'll be just a couple of days.

428
00:32:44,756 --> 00:32:47,546
We'll be back before Rocket's finished
fixing the ship.

429
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:52,676
What if the Sovereign come?

430
00:32:52,848 --> 00:32:54,928
There's no way for them to know
we're here. Let's go.

431
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:56,688
I'm uncertain about parting ways.

432
00:32:56,852 --> 00:32:58,402
God, you're like an old woman.

433
00:32:58,562 --> 00:33:00,272
Because I'm wise?

434
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:03,191
Why do you have so much luggage?

435
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:05,528
I don't want Groot playing
with my things.

436
00:33:08,572 --> 00:33:11,242
I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick
as you, orphan boy.

437
00:33:13,243 --> 00:33:17,083
What is your goal here?
To get everybody to hate you?

438
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:19,923
Because it's working.

439
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:28,595
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again

440
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:34,763
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain

441
00:33:34,932 --> 00:33:37,932
And if you don't love me now

442
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:41,231
You will never love me again

443
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:45,276
I can still hear you saying

444
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:47,492
You would never break the chain

445
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:50,783
And if you don't love me now

446
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:53,658
You will never love me again

447
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:56,785
I can still hear you saying

448
00:33:56,954 --> 00:34:00,504
You would never break the chain

449
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:09,299
Hey, can I ask you a personal question?

450
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:13,636
No one has ever asked me
a personal question.

451
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:15,511
Your antennae, what are they for?

452
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:17,181
Their purpose?

453
00:34:17,307 --> 00:34:19,137
Yes. Quill and I have a bet.

454
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:21,519
Dude. You're not supposed to say that!

455
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:23,559
I say...

456
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,070
if you are about to go through
a doorway that is too low...

457
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:28,993
your antennae will feel this,
and keep you from being decapitated.

458
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:31,322
Right. And if it's anything
other than...

459
00:34:31,488 --> 00:34:34,908
you specifically not being decapitated
by a doorway, I win.

460
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:37,575
They are not for feeling doorways.

461
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:40,536
I think...

462
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:43,496
they have something
to do with my empathic abilities.

463
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:45,084
What are those?

464
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:48,669
If I touch someone,
I can feel their feelings.

465
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:51,416
- You read minds?
- No.

466
00:34:51,592 --> 00:34:53,892
Telepaths know thoughts.

467
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:56,552
Empaths feel feelings.

468
00:34:57,848 --> 00:34:58,848
Emotions.

469
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:02,521
May I?

470
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:05,112
All right.

471
00:35:13,363 --> 00:35:15,873
You feel love.

472
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:20,411
Yeah. I guess I feel a general,
unselfish love for just about everybody.

473
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:21,709
No!

474
00:35:21,872 --> 00:35:23,872
Romantic, sexual love.

475
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:25,381
No, I don't.

476
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:27,212
- For her!
- No!

477
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:31,757
Okay.

478
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:36,888
She just told everyone your deepest,
darkest secret!

479
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:39,394
Dude, I think
you're overreacting a little bit!

480
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:40,926
You must be so embarrassed!

481
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,650
Do me! Do me!

482
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:54,902
I have never felt such humor!

483
00:35:58,408 --> 00:36:00,448
So unbelievably uncool.

484
00:36:01,787 --> 00:36:02,997
Quill.

485
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:09,592
Touch me, and the only thing
you're gonna feel is a broken jaw.

486
00:36:14,925 --> 00:36:18,645
I can also alter emotions
to some extent.

487
00:36:18,804 --> 00:36:19,804
Yeah, like what?

488
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:23,677
If I touch someone who is sad...

489
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:26,601
I can ease them into contentment
for a short while.

490
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:30,610
I can make a stubborn
person compliant.

491
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:33,784
But I mostly use it
to help my master sleep.

492
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:37,784
He lies awake at night
thinking about his progeny.

493
00:36:39,992 --> 00:36:41,202
Do one of those on me.

494
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:47,456
Sleep.

495
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:41,759
I love this song.

496
00:38:13,544 --> 00:38:14,884
There!

497
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:37,707
Ain't so tough now without
all your toys...

498
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:38,878
are you?

499
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:43,129
Move!

500
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,070
Crap.

501
00:40:06,615 --> 00:40:07,995
Hey there, rat!

502
00:40:08,158 --> 00:40:10,618
How's it going, you blue idiot?

503
00:40:10,994 --> 00:40:13,084
Not so bad.

504
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:15,617
We got ourselves a pretty good
little gig here.

505
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:18,591
This golden gal with
quite a high opinion of herself...

506
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:22,672
has offered us a large sum to deliver
you and your pals over to her...

507
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,470
because she wants to kill y'all.

508
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:26,844
Your friend...

509
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,640
There's too many of them.

510
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:32,024
He needs my help.
If you care about him...

511
00:40:32,182 --> 00:40:34,932
you need to get me out of these bonds.

512
00:40:35,477 --> 00:40:37,347
They are going to kill him!

513
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:39,691
I tell you, it was pretty easy
to find you.

514
00:40:39,857 --> 00:40:41,817
I put a tracer
on your ship back there...

515
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,364
during the war over Xandar.

516
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:46,201
Give me your word
you won't hurt Groot...

517
00:40:46,363 --> 00:40:48,373
and I'll tell you
where the batteries are.

518
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:51,526
Lucky for you, my word
don't mean squat.

519
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:54,294
Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.

520
00:40:54,454 --> 00:40:55,794
Otherwise, you'd what?

521
00:40:56,957 --> 00:40:58,327
We'll take them batteries.

522
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,050
They're worth what?
A quarter mill on the open market?

523
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:04,552
That Priestess offered us a million.

524
00:41:04,715 --> 00:41:07,385
A quarter is only one third of that!

525
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:08,721
A quarter ain't a third.

526
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:10,716
A quarter is 25.

527
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:11,888
No.

528
00:41:11,972 --> 00:41:14,392
We can't even buy a pair of boots
with 25 units.

529
00:41:14,558 --> 00:41:15,388
Enough!

530
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:20,519
The point is, we ain't stupid enough
to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!

531
00:41:20,898 --> 00:41:23,398
The whole dang Nova Corps
would be on us.

532
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:25,487
That ain't right!

533
00:41:26,236 --> 00:41:29,316
I just gotta say it
this one time, Captain.

534
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:31,739
No matter how many times
Quill betrays you...

535
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:34,739
you protect him
like none of the rest of us much matter!

536
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:35,912
Yeah!

537
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,579
I'm the one what sticks up for you!

538
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:38,748
Take it easy, Kraglin.

539
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:41,416
Damn straight, lad. He's gone soft.

540
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:44,715
Suppose it's time for a change
in leadership.

541
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:51,968
Put your damn guns down!

542
00:41:52,137 --> 00:41:53,387
Whoa! Whoa!

543
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:57,015
There must be some kind of
peaceful resolution to this, fellas.

544
00:41:57,184 --> 00:42:00,064
Or even a violent one
where I'm standing over there.

545
00:42:19,122 --> 00:42:20,792
Well, hello, boys.

546
00:42:26,463 --> 00:42:28,173
It's not ripe.

547
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:16,219
Welcome, everyone, to my world.

548
00:43:16,388 --> 00:43:18,808
Wow. You have your own planet?

549
00:43:18,974 --> 00:43:22,774
Come on.
No larger than your Earth's Moon.

550
00:43:22,978 --> 00:43:24,478
Humility.

551
00:43:24,646 --> 00:43:26,016
I like it.

552
00:43:26,398 --> 00:43:28,858
I, too, am extraordinarily humble.

553
00:44:11,235 --> 00:44:15,325
You own a planet and can destroy
two dozen spaceships without a suit.

554
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:17,779
What are you exactly?

555
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:22,291
I'm what's called
a Celestial, sweetheart.

556
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:26,119
A Celestial, like a god?

557
00:44:27,793 --> 00:44:29,713
Small "g," son.

558
00:44:29,878 --> 00:44:32,708
At least on the days
I'm feeling humble as Drax.

559
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:45,351
Whoa!

560
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:50,517
I don't know where I came from exactly.

561
00:44:50,691 --> 00:44:52,691
First thing I remember is flickering...

562
00:44:53,277 --> 00:44:55,147
adrift in the cosmos utterly...

563
00:44:56,113 --> 00:44:58,663
and entirely alone.

564
00:44:59,741 --> 00:45:01,621
Over millions of years...

565
00:45:01,785 --> 00:45:05,325
I learned to control the molecules
around me.

566
00:45:05,664 --> 00:45:08,834
I grew smarter and stronger.

567
00:45:10,794 --> 00:45:13,764
And I continued building from there...

568
00:45:13,922 --> 00:45:16,012
layer by layer...

569
00:45:16,175 --> 00:45:18,805
the very planet you walk on now.

570
00:45:18,969 --> 00:45:20,259
Whoa.

571
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:22,098
But I wanted more.

572
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:24,893
I desired...

573
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:26,564
meaning.

574
00:45:27,728 --> 00:45:31,688
"There must be some life out there
in the universe...

575
00:45:31,857 --> 00:45:34,647
"besides just me," I thought.

576
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:38,818
And so, I set myself the task
of finding it.

577
00:45:39,156 --> 00:45:40,616
I created...

578
00:45:40,782 --> 00:45:44,412
what I imagined biological life
to be like...

579
00:45:44,578 --> 00:45:48,328
down to the most minute detail.

580
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:50,748
Did you make a penis?

581
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:52,168
Dude!

582
00:45:52,336 --> 00:45:53,496
What is wrong with you?

583
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:56,760
If he is a planet, how could he
make a baby with your mother?

584
00:45:56,924 --> 00:45:57,924
He would smush her!

585
00:46:00,135 --> 00:46:02,295
I don't need to hear how my parents...

586
00:46:03,514 --> 00:46:04,514
Why?

587
00:46:05,307 --> 00:46:07,557
My father would tell the
story of impregnating

588
00:46:07,643 --> 00:46:09,023
my mother every winter solstice.

589
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:10,481
That's disgusting.

590
00:46:10,646 --> 00:46:12,106
It was beautiful.

591
00:46:13,357 --> 00:46:14,897
You Earthers have hang-ups.

592
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:17,572
Yes, Drax, I got a penis.

593
00:46:18,403 --> 00:46:19,403
Thank you!

594
00:46:19,571 --> 00:46:20,741
It's not half bad.

595
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:26,083
I've also got pain receptors,
and a digestive system...

596
00:46:26,245 --> 00:46:28,045
and all the accompanying junk.

597
00:46:28,497 --> 00:46:33,127
I wanted to experience
what it truly meant to be human...

598
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:36,303
as I set out amongst the stars...

599
00:46:36,964 --> 00:46:39,134
until I found...

600
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:41,009
what I sought.

601
00:46:42,553 --> 00:46:43,723
Life.

602
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:47,892
I was not alone in the universe
after all.

603
00:46:54,606 --> 00:46:56,436
When did you meet my mother?

604
00:47:00,612 --> 00:47:02,362
Not long after.

605
00:47:08,036 --> 00:47:12,706
It was with Meredith
that I first experienced love.

606
00:47:16,587 --> 00:47:19,757
I called her my river lily.

607
00:47:24,052 --> 00:47:26,642
And from that love, Peter...

608
00:47:30,184 --> 00:47:31,394
you.

609
00:47:38,692 --> 00:47:42,202
I have searched for you for so long.

610
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,490
And when I heard of a man from Earth...

611
00:47:45,657 --> 00:47:49,407
who held an Infinity Stone
in his hand without dying...

612
00:47:51,163 --> 00:47:54,213
I knew you must be the son
of the woman I loved.

613
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:58,129
If you loved her, why did you leave her?

614
00:48:19,191 --> 00:48:21,071
This is mutiny!

615
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,150
This is mutiny!

616
00:48:24,321 --> 00:48:26,911
This is mutiny!

617
00:48:38,669 --> 00:48:40,089
You're scum!

618
00:49:15,831 --> 00:49:16,831
Captain!

619
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:19,384
Help me! Please!

620
00:49:19,543 --> 00:49:21,133
Captain!

621
00:49:24,381 --> 00:49:26,131
You're the one what killed those men...

622
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:28,505
by leading them down the wrong path.

623
00:49:29,386 --> 00:49:31,096
Because you're weak.

624
00:49:33,473 --> 00:49:35,063
And stupid!

625
00:49:37,102 --> 00:49:39,062
It's time for the Ravagers...

626
00:49:39,229 --> 00:49:43,069
to rise once again to glory
with a new captain...

627
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:45,529
Taserface!

628
00:49:53,202 --> 00:49:56,832
I'm sorry. Your name is...

629
00:49:56,997 --> 00:49:58,707
It's Taserface?

630
00:49:59,124 --> 00:50:00,424
That's right.

631
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:03,172
Do you shoot tasers out of your face?

632
00:50:03,795 --> 00:50:05,665
It's metaphorical!

633
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:06,839
Yeah!

634
00:50:10,344 --> 00:50:11,344
For what?

635
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:16,219
For it is a name what strikes fear...

636
00:50:16,391 --> 00:50:19,191
into the hearts of anyone what hears it.

637
00:50:21,855 --> 00:50:23,105
Okay.

638
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:24,900
Okay...

639
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:26,317
whatever you say.

640
00:50:26,818 --> 00:50:28,068
You shut up.

641
00:50:28,237 --> 00:50:29,527
You're next.

642
00:50:29,821 --> 00:50:33,911
Udonta, I have waited
a long time to do...

643
00:50:34,076 --> 00:50:35,076
What?

644
00:50:36,203 --> 00:50:39,123
I'm sorry. I am so sorry!

645
00:50:39,289 --> 00:50:42,289
I just keep imagining you
waking up in the morning, sir...

646
00:50:42,459 --> 00:50:45,459
looking in the mirror and then
in all seriousness saying to yourself...

647
00:50:45,629 --> 00:50:49,339
"You know what would be
a really kick-ass name? Taserface!"

648
00:50:51,635 --> 00:50:54,355
That's how I hear you in my head!

649
00:50:55,138 --> 00:50:57,308
What was your second choice?

650
00:50:57,474 --> 00:50:58,524
Scrotum Hat?

651
00:51:01,645 --> 00:51:04,235
New plan. We're killing you first.

652
00:51:05,649 --> 00:51:08,739
Well, dying is certainly better
than having to live an entire life...

653
00:51:08,902 --> 00:51:12,822
as a moronic shitbag who thinks
Taserface is a cool name.

654
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:15,910
That's enough killing for today.

655
00:51:19,872 --> 00:51:21,502
She's the daughter of Thanos.

656
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:25,957
I thought you were the biggest sadist
in the galaxy.

657
00:51:26,086 --> 00:51:28,916
That was when Daddy
was paying my bills.

658
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:32,679
The Priestess wants to
kill the fox herself.

659
00:51:32,843 --> 00:51:35,853
And he has bounties on his head
in at least 12 Kree provinces.

660
00:51:37,514 --> 00:51:38,894
I assure you...

661
00:51:39,057 --> 00:51:41,847
I am not as easy a mark as an old man
without his magic stick...

662
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:43,899
or a talking woodland beast.

663
00:51:45,272 --> 00:51:47,192
I want 10% of the take...

664
00:51:48,859 --> 00:51:50,569
and a couple more things.

665
00:51:52,404 --> 00:51:54,034
We got a whole box of hands...

666
00:51:54,198 --> 00:51:56,028
- if that one don't work out.
- It is fine.

667
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,410
You think them Kree
is gonna execute the captain?

668
00:51:59,578 --> 00:52:03,788
The Kree consider themselves merciful.
It will be painless.

669
00:52:03,957 --> 00:52:07,377
Well, here it is.
It's the best ship we got.

670
00:52:07,544 --> 00:52:09,214
Location of Ego's planet in the nav.

671
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:11,719
We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.

672
00:52:11,882 --> 00:52:14,052
What are you gonna
do with your share?

673
00:52:14,927 --> 00:52:15,797
As a child, my father would have

674
00:52:15,886 --> 00:52:19,136
Gamora and me battle
one another in training.

675
00:52:19,932 --> 00:52:22,232
Every time my sister prevailed...

676
00:52:22,392 --> 00:52:25,732
my father would replace a piece of me
with machinery...

677
00:52:25,896 --> 00:52:28,566
claiming he wanted me to be her equal.

678
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:31,480
But she won...

679
00:52:31,652 --> 00:52:36,492
again and again, and again,
never once refraining.

680
00:52:38,075 --> 00:52:40,455
So after I murder my sister...

681
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:43,829
I will buy a warship with
every conceivable instrument of death.

682
00:52:43,997 --> 00:52:47,627
I will hunt my father like a dog,
and I will tear him apart slowly...

683
00:52:47,793 --> 00:52:49,253
piece by piece...

684
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:52,799
until he knows some semblance
of the profound and unceasing pain...

685
00:52:52,965 --> 00:52:56,135
I know every single day.

686
00:52:57,928 --> 00:52:59,258
Yeah.

687
00:52:59,763 --> 00:53:01,603
I was talking about,
like, a pretty necklace.

688
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:04,269
Or a nice hat.

689
00:53:04,434 --> 00:53:07,274
Something to make the other girls go,
"Ooh, that's nice!"

690
00:53:11,108 --> 00:53:14,278
Anyways, happy trails.

691
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:25,659
My mother told everyone
my father was from the stars.

692
00:53:27,332 --> 00:53:29,832
She had brain cancer, so
everyone thought she was delusional.

693
00:53:30,002 --> 00:53:31,002
Peter...

694
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:33,106
Listen, I'd love to believe all of this,
I really would.

695
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:34,460
But you left...

696
00:53:34,631 --> 00:53:37,511
the most wonderful woman ever...

697
00:53:37,676 --> 00:53:39,136
to die alone.

698
00:53:39,303 --> 00:53:42,723
I didn't want to
leave your mother, Peter.

699
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:45,060
If I don't return regularly
to my planet...

700
00:53:45,225 --> 00:53:46,635
and the light within it...

701
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:48,310
this form will wither and perish.

702
00:53:48,478 --> 00:53:50,518
So why didn't you come back?
Why did you send Yondu?

703
00:53:50,689 --> 00:53:52,649
A criminal, of all people,
to come and fetch me?

704
00:53:53,025 --> 00:53:54,905
I loved your mother, Peter!

705
00:53:55,068 --> 00:53:57,488
I couldn't stand to set foot
on an Earth...

706
00:53:57,654 --> 00:54:00,494
where she wasn't living!
You can't imagine what that's like!

707
00:54:00,657 --> 00:54:03,077
I know exactly what that feels like!

708
00:54:03,243 --> 00:54:04,993
I had to watch her die!

709
00:54:09,374 --> 00:54:13,504
Over the millions and millions of years
of my existence...

710
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:16,170
I've made many mistakes, Peter.

711
00:54:17,007 --> 00:54:19,217
But you're not one of them.

712
00:54:21,011 --> 00:54:24,761
Please give me the chance to be
the father she would want me to be.

713
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:34,770
There's so much that I need to
teach you about this planet...

714
00:54:34,942 --> 00:54:36,692
and the light within.

715
00:54:37,027 --> 00:54:40,197
They are a part of you, Peter.

716
00:54:41,073 --> 00:54:42,743
What do you mean?

717
00:54:43,534 --> 00:54:45,454
Give me your hands, son.

718
00:54:46,411 --> 00:54:47,541
Here.

719
00:54:48,413 --> 00:54:50,293
Hold them like that.

720
00:54:56,213 --> 00:54:59,053
Now, close your eyes and concentrate.

721
00:55:00,217 --> 00:55:03,257
Take your brain
to the center of this planet.

722
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:08,981
Yes!

723
00:55:09,142 --> 00:55:10,142
Yes!

724
00:55:10,394 --> 00:55:12,064
Whoa!

725
00:55:12,229 --> 00:55:13,649
Yes! It's okay.

726
00:55:13,814 --> 00:55:14,904
Just relax. Concentrate.

727
00:55:15,065 --> 00:55:17,225
You can do it. Bring it back.

728
00:55:17,734 --> 00:55:18,824
Yes!

729
00:55:20,445 --> 00:55:23,235
Yes, now shape it.

730
00:55:23,574 --> 00:55:25,284
Feel that energy.

731
00:55:29,454 --> 00:55:30,464
Yes.

732
00:55:34,751 --> 00:55:36,131
You're home.

733
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:39,760
Peter...

734
00:56:14,291 --> 00:56:17,211
How did you get to this weird,
dumb planet?

735
00:56:17,794 --> 00:56:20,674
Ego found me in my larva state.

736
00:56:20,839 --> 00:56:22,339
Orphaned on my homeworld.

737
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,970
He raised me by hand,
and kept me as his own.

738
00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:28,807
So you're a pet?

739
00:56:29,973 --> 00:56:31,313
I suppose.

740
00:56:32,809 --> 00:56:35,189
People usually want cute pets.

741
00:56:35,354 --> 00:56:37,654
Why would Ego want
such a hideous one?

742
00:56:37,814 --> 00:56:39,074
I am hideous?

743
00:56:39,233 --> 00:56:41,483
You are horrifying to look at. Yes.

744
00:56:44,571 --> 00:56:45,741
But that's a good thing.

745
00:56:47,241 --> 00:56:48,881
When you're ugly,
and someone loves you...

746
00:56:48,992 --> 00:56:51,492
you know they love you
for who you are.

747
00:56:52,829 --> 00:56:55,249
Beautiful people never know
who to trust.

748
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:59,086
Well, then I'm certainly grateful
to be ugly.

749
00:57:00,546 --> 00:57:03,666
Those pools, they remind me of a time...

750
00:57:03,841 --> 00:57:07,431
when I took my daughter
to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld.

751
00:57:08,595 --> 00:57:09,925
She was like you.

752
00:57:10,347 --> 00:57:11,847
Disgusting?

753
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:14,020
Innocent.

754
00:57:47,301 --> 00:57:48,301
Drax?

755
00:57:49,928 --> 00:57:51,598
There's something I must tell you.

756
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,063
What's going on?

757
00:58:01,231 --> 00:58:03,151
This gross bug lady is my new friend.

758
00:58:03,317 --> 00:58:06,777
I'm learning many things,
like I'm a pet and ugly.

759
00:58:07,112 --> 00:58:08,742
You're not ugly. Drax!

760
00:58:08,906 --> 00:58:10,116
What are you talking about?

761
00:58:10,282 --> 00:58:11,452
Mantis...

762
00:58:11,909 --> 00:58:14,079
can you show us
where we'll be staying?

763
00:58:14,578 --> 00:58:16,338
Why are there no other beings
on this planet?

764
00:58:16,496 --> 00:58:18,576
The planet is Ego.

765
00:58:18,749 --> 00:58:20,999
A dog would not invite a flea
to live on his back.

766
00:58:21,752 --> 00:58:23,002
And you're not a flea?

767
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:25,460
I'm a flea with a purpose.

768
00:58:26,089 --> 00:58:27,759
I help him sleep.

769
00:58:28,926 --> 00:58:32,096
What were you about to say to Drax
before I walked out?

770
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,270
Nothing.

771
00:58:39,102 --> 00:58:41,022
Your quarters are this way.

772
00:58:48,612 --> 00:58:52,162
We deliver you to the Kree
in the morning.

773
00:58:54,451 --> 00:58:57,621
Neither one of you will last
much longer after that.

774
00:58:58,247 --> 00:59:00,287
Okay, Taserface.

775
00:59:00,958 --> 00:59:02,998
Hey, tell the other guys we said...

776
00:59:03,168 --> 00:59:04,628
"Hi," Taserface!

777
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,300
What about this little plant?
Can I smash it with a rock?

778
00:59:12,469 --> 00:59:13,969
No, Gef.

779
00:59:14,137 --> 00:59:15,847
It's too adorable to kill.

780
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:17,934
Take it to the tailor.

781
00:59:19,434 --> 00:59:22,814
No offense, but your employees
are a bunch of jerks.

782
00:59:25,148 --> 00:59:29,938
I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years
when Stakar freed me.

783
00:59:32,489 --> 00:59:35,159
He offered me a place
with the Ravagers.

784
00:59:35,325 --> 00:59:39,745
He said all I needed to do
was adhere to the code.

785
00:59:39,913 --> 00:59:41,663
But I was young...

786
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:46,126
and greedy, and stupid.

787
00:59:47,087 --> 00:59:49,167
Like you stealing those batteries.

788
00:59:49,339 --> 00:59:50,919
That was mostly Drax.

789
00:59:52,342 --> 00:59:55,852
Me and Stakar and the other captains...

790
00:59:56,847 --> 00:59:59,177
we weren't so different from you
and your friends.

791
01:00:00,142 --> 01:00:02,022
The only family I ever had.

792
01:00:03,437 --> 01:00:05,147
When I broke the code...

793
01:00:07,357 --> 01:00:09,027
they exiled me.

794
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,860
This is what I deserve.

795
01:00:12,029 --> 01:00:13,699
Slow down, drama queen.

796
01:00:13,864 --> 01:00:15,534
You might deserve this,
but I don't.

797
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:17,489
We gotta get outta here.

798
01:00:18,952 --> 01:00:20,162
Where's Quill?

799
01:00:20,329 --> 01:00:21,869
He went off with his old man.

800
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:25,170
- Ego?
- Yeah.

801
01:00:25,334 --> 01:00:27,424
It's a day for dumbass names.

802
01:00:30,464 --> 01:00:32,884
You're smiling.
And for a second, I got a warm feeling.

803
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:35,720
But then it was ruined
by those disgusting-ass teeth.

804
01:00:35,886 --> 01:00:38,256
You like a professional
asshole or what?

805
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:39,430
Pretty much a pro.

806
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:42,386
Why didn't you deliver Quill to Ego
like you promised?

807
01:00:42,935 --> 01:00:44,645
He was skinny.

808
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:49,230
Could fit into places we couldn't.
Good for thievin'.

809
01:00:54,154 --> 01:00:57,374
I got an idea on how to get outta here.

810
01:00:58,242 --> 01:01:00,742
But we're gonna need your little friend.

811
01:01:01,912 --> 01:01:04,372
Mascot, mascot, mascot...

812
01:01:15,425 --> 01:01:17,715
Little fellow's all worked up!
He needs a drink!

813
01:01:23,809 --> 01:01:26,519
Look how cute it is
when it's all riled up.

814
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:28,557
He's goddang precious!

815
01:01:42,619 --> 01:01:44,329
Hey, twig!

816
01:01:44,663 --> 01:01:46,123
Come here.

817
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:47,750
Come on.

818
01:01:54,339 --> 01:01:55,339
Aw, man...

819
01:01:55,424 --> 01:01:57,014
what did they do to you?

820
01:02:00,095 --> 01:02:02,555
Hey, you wanna help us get outta here?

821
01:02:03,348 --> 01:02:06,518
There's something I need you to get,
and bring back to me.

822
01:02:06,685 --> 01:02:10,805
In the captain's quarters,
there's a prototype fin...

823
01:02:10,981 --> 01:02:12,611
the thing I wore on my head.

824
01:02:13,275 --> 01:02:17,365
There's a drawer next to the bunk.
It's in that. It's red.

825
01:02:17,529 --> 01:02:18,819
You got it?

826
01:02:52,481 --> 01:02:54,021
That's my underwears.

827
01:02:54,191 --> 01:02:56,336
Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't know
what you were talkin' about.

828
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,490
You have to explain it more careful.

829
01:02:59,988 --> 01:03:03,408
It's a prototype fin.

830
01:03:08,872 --> 01:03:11,622
That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot.

831
01:03:11,792 --> 01:03:13,462
You explain it this time.

832
01:03:14,628 --> 01:03:16,168
All right.

833
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,760
That's Vorker's eye.

834
01:03:18,924 --> 01:03:20,934
He takes it out when he sleeps.

835
01:03:21,093 --> 01:03:22,433
Go. Look again.

836
01:03:22,594 --> 01:03:24,014
But leave the eye here.

837
01:03:24,638 --> 01:03:25,468
Why?

838
01:03:25,639 --> 01:03:27,019
He's gonna wake up tomorrow...

839
01:03:27,182 --> 01:03:29,522
and he's not gonna know...

840
01:03:29,685 --> 01:03:31,525
where his eye is!

841
01:03:38,151 --> 01:03:39,741
That's a desk.

842
01:03:39,903 --> 01:03:42,703
We told you it was this big.

843
01:03:48,579 --> 01:03:50,749
Tell me you guys have
a refrigerator somewhere...

844
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:53,634
with a bunch of severed human toes.

845
01:03:53,792 --> 01:03:57,502
Okay. Then let's just agree
to never discuss this.

846
01:04:00,674 --> 01:04:04,304
The drawer you wanna open
has this symbol on it.

847
01:04:04,469 --> 01:04:05,849
Okay?

848
01:04:14,396 --> 01:04:16,266
What? No!

849
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,792
He thinks you want him
to wear it as a hat.

850
01:04:17,816 --> 01:04:19,026
That's not what I said!

851
01:04:19,193 --> 01:04:21,323
- I am Groot.
- He's relieved you don't want him to.

852
01:04:21,486 --> 01:04:22,946
- I am Groot.
- He hates hats.

853
01:04:23,113 --> 01:04:23,913
I am Groot.

854
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:25,192
On anyone, not just himself.

855
01:04:25,324 --> 01:04:26,164
I am Groot.

856
01:04:26,325 --> 01:04:28,303
One minute you think someone
has a weird-shaped head...

857
01:04:28,327 --> 01:04:31,181
the next minute it's just because
you realize part of that head is the hat.

858
01:04:31,205 --> 01:04:32,585
That's why you don't like hats?

859
01:04:33,665 --> 01:04:36,035
This is an important conversation
right now?

860
01:05:12,788 --> 01:05:13,788
That ain't it.

861
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:25,130
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.

862
01:05:28,095 --> 01:05:29,935
They killed all my friends.

863
01:05:33,976 --> 01:05:36,556
Get the third quadrant ready
for release.

864
01:05:43,277 --> 01:05:44,277
One more thing.

865
01:05:46,029 --> 01:05:48,449
You got any clones of Quill's old music
on the ship?

866
01:06:39,249 --> 01:06:40,249
He's got it!

867
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:41,917
Yondu's got the fin!

868
01:06:42,085 --> 01:06:43,085
Go!

869
01:07:24,586 --> 01:07:25,586
Down there!

870
01:09:24,164 --> 01:09:25,624
You maniac.

871
01:09:27,543 --> 01:09:29,843
The whole ship's gonna blow.

872
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,260
Not the whole ship.

873
01:09:58,323 --> 01:09:59,373
Who is this?

874
01:09:59,533 --> 01:10:03,833
I am sending you the coordinates
for Yondu's ship.

875
01:10:04,288 --> 01:10:06,078
- Release the quadrant!
- Aye, Captain!

876
01:10:06,248 --> 01:10:08,748
I only ask one thing.

877
01:10:09,251 --> 01:10:10,881
That your High Priestess...

878
01:10:11,044 --> 01:10:14,634
tell him the name of the man
what sealed his fate.

879
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:17,631
Taserface!

880
01:10:41,074 --> 01:10:42,334
Where to, Captain?

881
01:10:42,492 --> 01:10:43,492
Ego.

882
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,330
No, boy!

883
01:10:54,046 --> 01:10:58,586
It ain't healthy for a mammalian body
to hop more than 50 jumps at a time.

884
01:10:58,759 --> 01:10:59,759
I know that.

885
01:10:59,885 --> 01:11:02,395
We are about to do 700!

886
01:11:16,109 --> 01:11:18,359
So I guess this could all
be mine someday.

887
01:11:19,613 --> 01:11:22,243
Rocket? Rocket, are you there?

888
01:11:29,373 --> 01:11:31,083
What are you doing, Peter?

889
01:11:33,377 --> 01:11:34,747
Dance with me.

890
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,380
I'm not going to dance with you.

891
01:11:36,547 --> 01:11:38,297
This is Sam Cooke...

892
01:11:38,841 --> 01:11:42,011
one of the greatest Earth singers
of all time.

893
01:12:11,164 --> 01:12:13,174
Drax thinks you're not a dancer.

894
01:12:14,293 --> 01:12:16,843
If you ever tell anyone about this...

895
01:12:17,004 --> 01:12:18,424
I will kill you.

896
01:12:19,173 --> 01:12:23,053
When are we gonna do something
about this unspoken thing between us?

897
01:12:23,677 --> 01:12:25,097
What unspoken thing?

898
01:12:26,555 --> 01:12:28,225
This...

899
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:31,180
Cheers, Sam and Diane...

900
01:12:31,351 --> 01:12:33,941
a guy and a girl on a TV show
who dig each other...

901
01:12:34,104 --> 01:12:36,664
but never say it because if they do,
the ratings would go down...

902
01:12:36,815 --> 01:12:37,855
sort of thing.

903
01:12:38,025 --> 01:12:39,485
There's no unspoken thing.

904
01:12:41,403 --> 01:12:44,703
Well, it's a catch-22, because if you
said it, then it would be spoken...

905
01:12:44,865 --> 01:12:47,625
and you would be a liar.
So, by not saying it...

906
01:12:47,784 --> 01:12:51,914
you are telling the truth,
and admitting that there is.

907
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,000
No, that's not what I...

908
01:12:56,335 --> 01:13:00,385
What we should be discussing right
now is something about this place.

909
01:13:00,547 --> 01:13:02,337
It doesn't feel right.

910
01:13:02,799 --> 01:13:04,969
What are you talking about?

911
01:13:05,135 --> 01:13:06,529
You're the one who wanted me
to come here!

912
01:13:06,553 --> 01:13:07,803
That girl Mantis...

913
01:13:07,971 --> 01:13:09,141
she's afraid of something.

914
01:13:09,473 --> 01:13:11,643
Why are you trying to take this
away from me?

915
01:13:11,808 --> 01:13:12,888
I'm not trying...

916
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:14,980
He's my father. He's blood.

917
01:13:15,145 --> 01:13:16,789
You have blood on Earth
and you never wanted to return there.

918
01:13:16,813 --> 01:13:19,073
Again, you made me come here!

919
01:13:19,233 --> 01:13:21,294
And Earth is the place
where my mother died in front of me.

920
01:13:21,318 --> 01:13:24,028
No, it's because that place is real,
and this is a fantasy.

921
01:13:24,196 --> 01:13:26,866
This is real! I'm only half human,
remember?

922
01:13:27,032 --> 01:13:28,492
That's the half I'm worried about.

923
01:13:29,034 --> 01:13:30,704
I get it. You're jealous...

924
01:13:30,869 --> 01:13:33,199
because I'm part-god,
and you like when I'm the weak one.

925
01:13:33,372 --> 01:13:36,002
You were insufferable to begin with.

926
01:13:36,166 --> 01:13:37,352
I haven't been able to reach Rocket.

927
01:13:37,376 --> 01:13:38,978
I'm gonna go outside,
and I'm gonna try and get a signal.

928
01:13:39,002 --> 01:13:41,842
You know what?
This is not Cheers after all!

929
01:13:42,005 --> 01:13:44,835
This is whatever the show is where
one person is willing...

930
01:13:45,008 --> 01:13:46,608
to open themselves up
to new possibility,

931
01:13:46,677 --> 01:13:48,507
and the other person is a jerk...

932
01:13:48,595 --> 01:13:52,265
who doesn't trust anybody!
It's a show that doesn't exist.

933
01:13:52,432 --> 01:13:53,932
That's why it would get zero ratings!

934
01:13:54,351 --> 01:13:56,351
I don't know what Cheers is!

935
01:13:56,687 --> 01:13:59,727
I finally found my family.
Don't you understand that?

936
01:14:00,899 --> 01:14:02,529
I thought you already had.

937
01:14:32,055 --> 01:14:33,255
Damn it.

938
01:15:06,423 --> 01:15:07,513
Psychopath!

939
01:17:17,888 --> 01:17:19,718
Are you kidding me?

940
01:17:46,124 --> 01:17:47,124
I win.

941
01:17:47,584 --> 01:17:49,794
I win. I bested you in combat.

942
01:17:49,962 --> 01:17:51,882
No. I saved your life.

943
01:17:52,047 --> 01:17:53,877
Well, you were stupid enough
to let me live.

944
01:17:54,049 --> 01:17:55,049
You let me live!

945
01:17:55,217 --> 01:17:56,967
I don't need you always
trying to beat me!

946
01:17:57,135 --> 01:17:58,238
I'm not the one that just flew across

947
01:17:58,262 --> 01:17:59,902
the universe just
because I wanted to win.

948
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:01,470
Do not tell me what I want.

949
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,160
I don't need to tell you
what you want!

950
01:18:03,225 --> 01:18:04,235
It's obvious!

951
01:18:04,393 --> 01:18:07,483
You were the one who wanted to win.
And I just wanted a sister!

952
01:18:15,237 --> 01:18:16,777
You were all I had.

953
01:18:18,115 --> 01:18:20,955
But you were the one
who needed to win.

954
01:18:22,119 --> 01:18:24,329
Thanos pulled my eye from my head...

955
01:18:25,122 --> 01:18:27,122
and my brain from my skull...

956
01:18:28,292 --> 01:18:30,172
and my arm from my body...

957
01:18:31,962 --> 01:18:34,092
because of you.

958
01:18:54,943 --> 01:18:55,993
You all right, son?

959
01:18:59,323 --> 01:19:01,993
I saw your girl stomp off
a little earlier in quite a huff.

960
01:19:02,618 --> 01:19:03,948
Yeah.

961
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:05,829
It's fortuitous...

962
01:19:05,996 --> 01:19:07,246
you listening to this song.

963
01:19:07,414 --> 01:19:09,044
- You know...
- Brandy?

964
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:10,631
By Looking Glass?

965
01:19:12,377 --> 01:19:13,747
A favorite of your mom's.

966
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:16,170
Yeah, it was.

967
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:18,350
One of Earth's greatest
musical compositions.

968
01:19:18,425 --> 01:19:20,505
Perhaps its very greatest.

969
01:19:20,677 --> 01:19:21,677
Yes!

970
01:19:21,845 --> 01:19:25,015
Peter, you and I,
we're the sailor in that song.

971
01:19:27,226 --> 01:19:29,136
He came on a summer's day

972
01:19:29,478 --> 01:19:31,978
Bringing gifts from far away

973
01:19:34,024 --> 01:19:36,484
Like the child I put in your mother...

974
01:19:36,652 --> 01:19:38,702
or the freedom you brought Gamora.

975
01:19:40,781 --> 01:19:43,781
Brandy, you're a fine girl

976
01:19:43,951 --> 01:19:46,621
What a good wife you would be

977
01:19:47,704 --> 01:19:50,334
My life, my love

978
01:19:50,499 --> 01:19:53,789
My lady is the sea

979
01:19:53,961 --> 01:19:55,801
The sea calls the sailor back.

980
01:19:55,963 --> 01:19:58,553
He loves the girl,
but that's not his place.

981
01:19:59,299 --> 01:20:03,299
The sea calls upon him
as history calls upon great men.

982
01:20:04,471 --> 01:20:08,021
And sometimes we are deprived
the pleasures of mortals.

983
01:20:08,559 --> 01:20:10,689
Well, you may not be mortal, but me...

984
01:20:10,853 --> 01:20:11,983
No, Peter...

985
01:20:12,145 --> 01:20:14,145
death will remain a stranger
to both of us...

986
01:20:14,565 --> 01:20:16,735
as long as the light
burns within the planet.

987
01:20:17,693 --> 01:20:18,783
I'm immortal?

988
01:20:21,029 --> 01:20:22,029
Really?

989
01:20:22,197 --> 01:20:25,027
Yes! As long as the light exists.

990
01:20:26,076 --> 01:20:29,326
And I can use the light
to build cool things...

991
01:20:29,496 --> 01:20:31,786
like how you made this whole planet?

992
01:20:31,957 --> 01:20:34,327
It might take you
a few million years of practice...

993
01:20:34,501 --> 01:20:36,711
before you get really good at it.
But, yes!

994
01:20:36,879 --> 01:20:37,919
What!

995
01:20:38,213 --> 01:20:41,683
Get ready for an 800-foot statue
of Pac-Man with Skeletor...

996
01:20:41,842 --> 01:20:42,882
and Heather Locklear.

997
01:20:43,051 --> 01:20:44,211
You can do anything you want.

998
01:20:44,344 --> 01:20:45,684
I'm gonna make some weird shit.

999
01:20:45,846 --> 01:20:49,016
But you know, Peter,
it is a tremendous responsibility.

1000
01:20:49,183 --> 01:20:51,693
Only we can remake the universe.

1001
01:20:51,852 --> 01:20:54,312
Only we can take the bridle
of the cosmos...

1002
01:20:54,479 --> 01:20:57,319
and lead it to where it needs to go.

1003
01:20:58,483 --> 01:20:59,533
How?

1004
01:21:09,995 --> 01:21:11,505
Come with me.

1005
01:21:21,381 --> 01:21:23,011
Drax, Drax. Drax!

1006
01:21:23,383 --> 01:21:25,053
Drax! We need to talk.

1007
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:28,967
I'm sorry.

1008
01:21:29,139 --> 01:21:31,309
But I like a woman
with some meat on her bones.

1009
01:21:31,475 --> 01:21:32,565
What?

1010
01:21:32,726 --> 01:21:35,976
I tried to let you down easily
by telling you I found you disgusting.

1011
01:21:36,146 --> 01:21:37,606
No, that's not what I...

1012
01:21:41,109 --> 01:21:42,529
What are you doing?

1013
01:21:43,111 --> 01:21:45,491
I'm imagining being with you physically.

1014
01:21:45,656 --> 01:21:46,946
Drax...

1015
01:21:47,491 --> 01:21:48,661
I don't like you like that.

1016
01:21:48,825 --> 01:21:50,785
I don't even like
the type of thing you are.

1017
01:21:51,286 --> 01:21:53,746
Hey! There's no need to get personal.

1018
01:21:53,914 --> 01:21:56,464
Listen! Ego's gotten exactly
what he wanted.

1019
01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:58,425
I should have told you earlier.

1020
01:21:58,585 --> 01:22:01,705
I'm stupid. You are in danger.

1021
01:22:07,427 --> 01:22:08,427
What is that?

1022
01:22:11,932 --> 01:22:15,482
Now, you need to readjust the way
you process life.

1023
01:22:15,644 --> 01:22:18,734
Everything around us,
including the girl...

1024
01:22:18,897 --> 01:22:22,357
Everything is temporary.

1025
01:22:22,526 --> 01:22:25,446
We are forever.

1026
01:22:25,612 --> 01:22:26,952
Doesn't eternity get boring?

1027
01:22:27,114 --> 01:22:29,534
Not if you have a purpose, Peter...

1028
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,660
which is why you're here.

1029
01:22:31,827 --> 01:22:33,947
I told you how all those years ago...

1030
01:22:34,121 --> 01:22:38,251
I had an unceasing impulse to find life.

1031
01:22:38,417 --> 01:22:42,457
But what I did not tell you was how,
when I finally did find it...

1032
01:22:43,213 --> 01:22:44,513
it was all so...

1033
01:22:46,967 --> 01:22:48,797
disappointing.

1034
01:22:49,136 --> 01:22:52,636
And that is when I came...

1035
01:22:52,806 --> 01:22:56,516
to a profound realization.

1036
01:22:57,811 --> 01:23:01,941
My innate desire to seek out
other life...

1037
01:23:02,482 --> 01:23:06,652
was not so that I could
walk among that life.

1038
01:23:08,947 --> 01:23:10,117
Peter...

1039
01:23:11,074 --> 01:23:14,294
I have found meaning.

1040
01:23:34,181 --> 01:23:35,521
I see it.

1041
01:23:37,976 --> 01:23:39,806
Eternity!

1042
01:23:40,145 --> 01:23:41,645
Oh, my God.

1043
01:23:52,241 --> 01:23:54,331
We need to get off this planet.

1044
01:24:08,006 --> 01:24:09,296
Oh, man.

1045
01:24:09,466 --> 01:24:11,886
Anyway, before I was
so rudely interrupted...

1046
01:24:12,052 --> 01:24:14,932
At that time,
I was a Federal Express man.

1047
01:24:25,858 --> 01:24:27,898
What the hell you doing, boy?

1048
01:24:28,068 --> 01:24:30,148
I could tell
by how you talked about him...

1049
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:31,650
this Ego is bad news.

1050
01:24:31,822 --> 01:24:33,452
We're here to save Quill.

1051
01:24:33,615 --> 01:24:37,655
For what? Huh?
For honor? For love?

1052
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:40,750
No. I don't care about those things.

1053
01:24:40,914 --> 01:24:43,214
I wanna save Quill so I can prove
I'm better than him!

1054
01:24:43,375 --> 01:24:46,205
I can lord this over him forever.

1055
01:24:47,921 --> 01:24:49,801
What are you laughing at me for?

1056
01:24:50,382 --> 01:24:55,102
You can fool yourself and everyone
else, but you can't fool me.

1057
01:24:55,262 --> 01:24:56,472
I know who you are.

1058
01:24:56,638 --> 01:24:58,928
You don't know anything
about me, loser.

1059
01:24:59,099 --> 01:25:01,349
I know everything about you.

1060
01:25:01,852 --> 01:25:04,232
I know you play like
you're the meanest and the hardest...

1061
01:25:04,396 --> 01:25:05,999
but, actually,
you're the most scared of all.

1062
01:25:06,023 --> 01:25:06,863
Shut up!

1063
01:25:07,024 --> 01:25:09,324
I know you steal batteries
you don't need...

1064
01:25:09,484 --> 01:25:12,074
and you push away anyone
who's willing to put up with you...

1065
01:25:12,237 --> 01:25:13,673
because just a little bit of love...

1066
01:25:13,697 --> 01:25:17,027
reminds you how big and empty
that hole inside you actually is.

1067
01:25:17,367 --> 01:25:18,617
I said shut up!

1068
01:25:19,077 --> 01:25:22,157
I know them scientists what made you,
never gave a rat's ass about you.

1069
01:25:22,331 --> 01:25:23,621
I'm serious, dude!

1070
01:25:23,790 --> 01:25:26,380
Just like my own damn parents
who sold me...

1071
01:25:26,543 --> 01:25:28,553
their own little baby,
into slavery.

1072
01:25:29,046 --> 01:25:31,296
I know who you are, boy.

1073
01:25:31,465 --> 01:25:33,475
Because you're me.

1074
01:25:40,015 --> 01:25:42,095
What kind of a pair are we?

1075
01:25:43,393 --> 01:25:46,443
The kind that's about to go fight
a planet, I reckon.

1076
01:25:46,605 --> 01:25:49,775
All right, okay! Good. Wait.

1077
01:25:50,192 --> 01:25:51,612
Fight a what?

1078
01:25:55,989 --> 01:25:56,989
Who are you people?

1079
01:25:57,115 --> 01:25:58,115
What is this place?

1080
01:25:58,242 --> 01:25:59,242
Gamora, let her go!

1081
01:25:59,409 --> 01:26:01,579
The bodies in the caverns...
Who are they?

1082
01:26:01,745 --> 01:26:04,035
You are scared.

1083
01:26:07,459 --> 01:26:10,339
I call it the Expansion.

1084
01:26:11,463 --> 01:26:14,763
It is my purpose...

1085
01:26:14,925 --> 01:26:18,435
and now it is yours as well.

1086
01:26:19,304 --> 01:26:20,894
It's beautiful.

1087
01:26:22,015 --> 01:26:23,305
Over thousands of years...

1088
01:26:23,475 --> 01:26:27,595
I implanted thousands of extensions
of myself...

1089
01:26:27,771 --> 01:26:30,481
on thousands of worlds.

1090
01:26:30,649 --> 01:26:34,439
I need to fulfill life's
one true purpose...

1091
01:26:34,611 --> 01:26:36,491
To grow and spread...

1092
01:26:36,655 --> 01:26:39,785
covering all that exists...

1093
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:44,120
until everything is...

1094
01:26:45,414 --> 01:26:46,414
Me!

1095
01:26:47,207 --> 01:26:49,457
What did she do to me?

1096
01:26:49,626 --> 01:26:51,336
She already told me everything.

1097
01:26:51,503 --> 01:26:53,963
I only had one problem.

1098
01:26:54,673 --> 01:26:59,723
A single Celestial doesn't have
enough power for such an enterprise.

1099
01:26:59,887 --> 01:27:02,007
But two Celestials...

1100
01:27:02,181 --> 01:27:05,481
Well, now, that just might do.

1101
01:27:08,228 --> 01:27:09,598
The bodies...

1102
01:27:10,355 --> 01:27:12,765
are his children.

1103
01:27:13,192 --> 01:27:14,482
Out of all my labors...

1104
01:27:14,651 --> 01:27:16,781
the most beguiling was...

1105
01:27:16,945 --> 01:27:20,365
attempting to graft my DNA
with that of another species.

1106
01:27:20,532 --> 01:27:23,452
I hoped the result of such a coupling
would be enough...

1107
01:27:23,619 --> 01:27:25,539
to power the Expansion.

1108
01:27:26,538 --> 01:27:29,038
I had Yondu deliver
some of them to me.

1109
01:27:29,208 --> 01:27:32,708
It broke the Ravager code, but
I compensated him generously...

1110
01:27:32,878 --> 01:27:36,458
and to ease his conscience,
I said I'd never hurt them.

1111
01:27:36,632 --> 01:27:39,262
I mean, that was true.
They never felt a thing.

1112
01:27:39,426 --> 01:27:42,716
But one after the other, they failed me.

1113
01:27:42,888 --> 01:27:46,728
Not one of them carried
the Celestial genes.

1114
01:27:46,892 --> 01:27:48,142
Until you, Peter.

1115
01:27:49,353 --> 01:27:51,943
Out of all my spawn...

1116
01:27:52,105 --> 01:27:56,185
only you carried the connection
to the light.

1117
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:59,240
We need to find Peter now,
and get off this damn planet.

1118
01:27:59,404 --> 01:28:01,994
Ego will have won him
to his side by now.

1119
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,580
- Then we just go.
- No!

1120
01:28:04,743 --> 01:28:07,003
- He's our friend.
- All any of you do...

1121
01:28:07,162 --> 01:28:09,332
is yell at each other.
You are not friends.

1122
01:28:09,498 --> 01:28:10,868
You're right.

1123
01:28:11,416 --> 01:28:12,536
We're family.

1124
01:28:14,378 --> 01:28:15,998
We leave no one behind.

1125
01:28:19,383 --> 01:28:20,763
Except maybe you.

1126
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:22,760
Oh, my God.

1127
01:28:23,428 --> 01:28:25,508
For the first time in my existence...

1128
01:28:25,681 --> 01:28:28,731
I am truly not alone!

1129
01:28:34,147 --> 01:28:35,437
What is it, son?

1130
01:28:38,694 --> 01:28:39,944
My friends.

1131
01:28:41,196 --> 01:28:45,236
You see,
that's the mortal in you, Peter.

1132
01:28:45,784 --> 01:28:46,784
Yes.

1133
01:28:46,827 --> 01:28:49,907
We are beyond such things.

1134
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:51,080
Yes.

1135
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:54,710
- Now...
- But my mother...

1136
01:28:57,588 --> 01:28:59,918
You said you loved my mother.

1137
01:29:00,090 --> 01:29:01,590
And that I did.

1138
01:29:02,843 --> 01:29:07,723
My river lily who knew all the words
to every song that came over the radio.

1139
01:29:09,516 --> 01:29:12,186
I returned to Earth
to see her three times.

1140
01:29:12,352 --> 01:29:14,902
And I knew if I returned a fourth...

1141
01:29:15,063 --> 01:29:16,613
I'd never leave.

1142
01:29:17,733 --> 01:29:19,283
The Expansion...

1143
01:29:20,694 --> 01:29:23,034
the reason for my very existence,
would be over.

1144
01:29:23,197 --> 01:29:25,237
So, I did what I had to do.

1145
01:29:28,035 --> 01:29:31,545
But it broke my heart
to put that tumor in her head.

1146
01:29:36,043 --> 01:29:36,883
What?

1147
01:29:37,044 --> 01:29:38,594
Now, all right...

1148
01:29:38,754 --> 01:29:40,514
I know that sounds bad.

1149
01:29:52,434 --> 01:29:55,904
Who in the hell do you think you are?

1150
01:29:56,063 --> 01:29:57,693
You killed my mother!

1151
01:29:57,856 --> 01:29:58,896
I tried...

1152
01:29:59,066 --> 01:30:00,816
so hard...

1153
01:30:00,984 --> 01:30:02,364
to find the form...

1154
01:30:02,528 --> 01:30:04,898
that best suited you...

1155
01:30:05,072 --> 01:30:07,492
and this is the thanks I get?

1156
01:30:09,201 --> 01:30:11,751
You really need to grow up.

1157
01:30:15,832 --> 01:30:18,082
I wanted to do this together...

1158
01:30:18,252 --> 01:30:21,052
but I suppose you'll have
to learn by spending

1159
01:30:21,171 --> 01:30:23,631
the next thousand years as a battery!

1160
01:30:25,342 --> 01:30:27,142
Finally! Rocket?

1161
01:30:27,302 --> 01:30:30,012
Keep that transmitter nearby,
so I can find you.

1162
01:30:30,180 --> 01:30:33,350
We're in an old piece of construction
equipment Yondu once used...

1163
01:30:33,517 --> 01:30:34,953
to slice open the Bank of A'askavaria.

1164
01:30:34,977 --> 01:30:35,977
Ego's unhinged.

1165
01:30:36,019 --> 01:30:37,439
I know. Get ready.

1166
01:30:37,604 --> 01:30:39,024
Drop her, Kraglin.

1167
01:30:57,624 --> 01:30:58,754
No.

1168
01:31:09,845 --> 01:31:12,725
My life, my love

1169
01:31:12,890 --> 01:31:15,100
My lady is the sea

1170
01:31:17,186 --> 01:31:18,306
Peter...

1171
01:31:19,104 --> 01:31:21,444
this is the sea.

1172
01:32:04,608 --> 01:32:06,278
Hey, there, jackass!

1173
01:32:16,537 --> 01:32:18,037
What is that thing?

1174
01:32:25,546 --> 01:32:27,506
Out of the way, dumber, smaller Groot!

1175
01:32:32,261 --> 01:32:34,931
I told you something didn't feel right.

1176
01:32:35,097 --> 01:32:37,387
"I told you so."
Just what I need to hear right now.

1177
01:32:37,558 --> 01:32:39,228
Well, I came back, didn't I?

1178
01:32:39,893 --> 01:32:41,253
Because there's an unspoken thing.

1179
01:32:41,353 --> 01:32:43,403
There is no unspoken thing.

1180
01:32:43,564 --> 01:32:45,404
What are you doing?
You could've killed us all!

1181
01:32:45,941 --> 01:32:47,481
"Thank you, Rocket"?

1182
01:32:47,651 --> 01:32:48,821
We had it under control.

1183
01:32:48,986 --> 01:32:51,316
We did not.
That is only an extension...

1184
01:32:51,488 --> 01:32:53,618
of his true self.
He will be back soon.

1185
01:32:53,782 --> 01:32:55,032
What's Smurfette doing here?

1186
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:57,040
Whatever I need to do to get
a damn ride home.

1187
01:32:57,202 --> 01:32:58,452
She tried to murder me!

1188
01:32:58,620 --> 01:33:00,460
I saved you, you stupid fox!

1189
01:33:00,622 --> 01:33:02,042
He's not a fox.

1190
01:33:02,207 --> 01:33:04,247
- I am Groot.
- I'm not a raboon, either.

1191
01:33:04,418 --> 01:33:05,418
I am Groot.

1192
01:33:05,586 --> 01:33:07,126
"Raccoon." Whatever.

1193
01:33:10,549 --> 01:33:11,879
How do we kill a Celestial?

1194
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:13,470
There's a center to him.

1195
01:33:13,635 --> 01:33:17,135
His brain, his soul, whatever it is...
Some sort of protective shell.

1196
01:33:17,472 --> 01:33:18,522
It's in the caverns...

1197
01:33:18,682 --> 01:33:19,772
below the surface.

1198
01:33:22,352 --> 01:33:23,652
Yondu?

1199
01:33:32,571 --> 01:33:33,821
Thrusters are out.

1200
01:33:34,323 --> 01:33:36,073
Guess I should be glad
I was a skinny kid.

1201
01:33:36,241 --> 01:33:38,201
Otherwise, you'd have delivered me
to this maniac.

1202
01:33:38,243 --> 01:33:40,763
You still reckon that's the reason
I kept you around, you idiot?

1203
01:33:40,829 --> 01:33:42,389
That's what you told me,
you old doofus.

1204
01:33:42,956 --> 01:33:45,076
Once I figured out
what happened to them other kids...

1205
01:33:45,209 --> 01:33:46,789
I wasn't just gonna hand you over.

1206
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,500
You said you were gonna eat me.

1207
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:50,210
That was being funny!

1208
01:33:51,006 --> 01:33:52,166
Not to me!

1209
01:33:52,341 --> 01:33:53,511
You people have issues.

1210
01:33:53,675 --> 01:33:55,545
Of course I have issues.

1211
01:33:56,386 --> 01:33:59,216
That's my freakin' father!

1212
01:33:59,389 --> 01:34:00,969
Thrusters are back up.

1213
01:34:14,571 --> 01:34:16,741
- We should be going up!
- We can't!

1214
01:34:16,907 --> 01:34:19,487
Ego wants to eradicate the universe
as we know it.

1215
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:20,950
We have to kill him.

1216
01:34:21,119 --> 01:34:21,789
Rocket!

1217
01:34:21,954 --> 01:34:22,954
Got it!

1218
01:34:36,844 --> 01:34:38,684
So, we're saving the galaxy again?

1219
01:34:38,846 --> 01:34:39,926
I guess.

1220
01:34:40,097 --> 01:34:41,177
Awesome!

1221
01:34:43,183 --> 01:34:45,393
We're really gonna be able to
jack up our prices...

1222
01:34:45,561 --> 01:34:47,151
if we're two-time galaxy savers.

1223
01:34:47,312 --> 01:34:49,902
I seriously can't believe
that's where your mind goes.

1224
01:34:50,065 --> 01:34:52,815
It was just a random thought, man.
I thought we were friends.

1225
01:34:52,985 --> 01:34:55,285
Of course, I care about the planets,
and the buildings...

1226
01:34:55,445 --> 01:34:57,275
and all the animals on the planets.

1227
01:34:57,447 --> 01:34:58,657
And the people.

1228
01:34:58,824 --> 01:34:59,824
Meh.

1229
01:35:00,450 --> 01:35:04,620
The crabby puppy is so cute.
He makes me wanna die!

1230
01:35:42,326 --> 01:35:43,326
Pilots...

1231
01:35:43,493 --> 01:35:44,833
release envoy units.

1232
01:35:46,997 --> 01:35:51,077
Our sensors detect the batteries
are below the surface of the planet.

1233
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:53,920
Dive!

1234
01:36:10,896 --> 01:36:12,396
Captain?

1235
01:36:13,148 --> 01:36:14,568
Captain?

1236
01:36:19,530 --> 01:36:21,280
Tell me why Ego wants you here?

1237
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:23,540
He needs my genetic connection
to the light...

1238
01:36:23,617 --> 01:36:25,737
to help destroy the universe.

1239
01:36:25,911 --> 01:36:28,161
He tried to teach me
how to control the power.

1240
01:36:28,330 --> 01:36:29,460
So, could you?

1241
01:36:29,623 --> 01:36:30,793
A little.

1242
01:36:30,958 --> 01:36:32,128
I made a ball.

1243
01:36:32,292 --> 01:36:33,342
A ball?

1244
01:36:33,502 --> 01:36:36,882
I thought as hard as I could.
It was all that I could come up with.

1245
01:36:37,047 --> 01:36:38,297
You "thought"?

1246
01:36:38,465 --> 01:36:40,505
You think when I make this arrow fly...

1247
01:36:40,676 --> 01:36:42,086
I use my head?

1248
01:36:54,064 --> 01:36:55,364
Whoa.

1249
01:37:04,199 --> 01:37:05,199
There.

1250
01:37:05,367 --> 01:37:07,327
That's Ego's core.

1251
01:37:09,705 --> 01:37:11,335
That ore is thick, Rocket.

1252
01:37:11,498 --> 01:37:13,118
I got it covered.

1253
01:37:19,506 --> 01:37:20,836
We must hurry.

1254
01:37:21,008 --> 01:37:23,128
It will not take Ego long to find us.

1255
01:37:27,347 --> 01:37:28,557
Keep it steady.

1256
01:37:35,063 --> 01:37:37,153
We drill into the center, we kill him!

1257
01:37:43,530 --> 01:37:44,860
Captain?

1258
01:37:45,199 --> 01:37:46,199
What is it, Kraglin?

1259
01:37:46,366 --> 01:37:48,406
Hey, remember that Ayesha chick?

1260
01:37:48,869 --> 01:37:50,039
Yeah, why?

1261
01:37:51,038 --> 01:37:52,078
Oh, hell!

1262
01:38:12,851 --> 01:38:14,561
Why aren't you firing the lasers?

1263
01:38:14,937 --> 01:38:16,647
They blew out the generator.

1264
01:38:16,813 --> 01:38:19,573
I think I packed a small detonator.

1265
01:38:19,733 --> 01:38:21,453
A detonator is worthless
without explosives.

1266
01:38:21,485 --> 01:38:23,075
Well, we got these.

1267
01:38:23,737 --> 01:38:25,737
Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?

1268
01:38:25,906 --> 01:38:27,816
If it is,
it'll cause a chain reaction...

1269
01:38:27,991 --> 01:38:29,661
throughout his entire nervous system.

1270
01:38:29,826 --> 01:38:30,576
Meaning what?

1271
01:38:30,744 --> 01:38:32,374
The entire planet will explode.

1272
01:38:32,538 --> 01:38:34,038
We'll have to get out of here fast.

1273
01:38:34,206 --> 01:38:35,706
I rigged a timer.

1274
01:38:36,667 --> 01:38:37,877
Go!

1275
01:38:51,974 --> 01:38:53,774
He's coming.

1276
01:38:55,185 --> 01:38:56,975
Didn't you say you
could make him sleep?

1277
01:38:57,354 --> 01:38:59,774
When he wants. He's too powerful.

1278
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:01,360
I can't!

1279
01:39:01,775 --> 01:39:03,645
You don't have to believe in yourself...

1280
01:39:04,361 --> 01:39:06,491
because I believe in you.

1281
01:39:18,792 --> 01:39:19,792
Sleep!

1282
01:39:27,176 --> 01:39:28,776
I never thought
she'd be able to do it...

1283
01:39:28,927 --> 01:39:31,177
with as weak and skinny
as she appears to be.

1284
01:39:32,097 --> 01:39:35,177
I don't know how long I can hold him.

1285
01:39:38,312 --> 01:39:39,982
The metal's too thick.

1286
01:39:40,147 --> 01:39:43,477
For the bomb to work, we'd actually
need to place it on Ego's core.

1287
01:39:43,650 --> 01:39:46,030
And our fat butts ain't gonna fit
through those tiny holes.

1288
01:39:46,737 --> 01:39:47,737
Well...

1289
01:39:50,324 --> 01:39:52,204
That's a terrible idea.

1290
01:39:52,367 --> 01:39:54,737
Which is the only kind of idea
we have left.

1291
01:39:55,704 --> 01:39:57,124
Unbelievable.

1292
01:39:57,289 --> 01:39:59,619
"Rocket, do this.
Rocket, do that."

1293
01:40:01,126 --> 01:40:02,586
What a day.

1294
01:40:10,177 --> 01:40:13,717
All right, first you flick this switch,
then this switch.

1295
01:40:13,889 --> 01:40:15,099
That activates it.

1296
01:40:15,265 --> 01:40:17,095
Then you push this button...

1297
01:40:17,267 --> 01:40:20,307
which will give you five minutes
to get out of there.

1298
01:40:20,479 --> 01:40:21,859
Now, whatever you do...

1299
01:40:22,397 --> 01:40:24,817
don't push this button...

1300
01:40:24,983 --> 01:40:28,573
because that will set off the bomb
immediately and we'll all be dead.

1301
01:40:28,737 --> 01:40:31,157
Now, repeat back what I just said.

1302
01:40:31,323 --> 01:40:33,123
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.

1303
01:40:33,283 --> 01:40:35,243
- I am Groot.
- That's right.

1304
01:40:35,410 --> 01:40:36,620
- I am Groot.
- No!

1305
01:40:36,954 --> 01:40:39,334
No, that's the button
that will kill everyone!

1306
01:40:39,498 --> 01:40:40,498
Try again.

1307
01:40:43,502 --> 01:40:45,342
- I am Groot.
- Mm-hmm.

1308
01:40:45,504 --> 01:40:47,554
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.

1309
01:40:47,714 --> 01:40:48,714
I am Groot.

1310
01:40:48,799 --> 01:40:50,629
No! That's exactly what you just said!

1311
01:40:50,801 --> 01:40:52,391
How is that even possible?

1312
01:40:52,553 --> 01:40:54,763
Which button is the button
you're supposed to push?

1313
01:40:54,930 --> 01:40:56,060
Point to it.

1314
01:40:56,223 --> 01:40:57,223
No!

1315
01:40:57,516 --> 01:40:59,266
Hey, you're making him nervous!

1316
01:40:59,434 --> 01:41:01,194
Shut up and get me some tape!

1317
01:41:01,353 --> 01:41:02,833
Does anybody have any tape out there?

1318
01:41:02,896 --> 01:41:04,616
I wanna put some tape
over the death button.

1319
01:41:04,773 --> 01:41:07,653
I don't have any tape. Let me check.

1320
01:41:07,818 --> 01:41:09,278
Yo, Yondu...

1321
01:41:10,654 --> 01:41:12,824
Do you have any tape?

1322
01:41:15,117 --> 01:41:18,157
Gamora? Do you have any tape?

1323
01:41:18,328 --> 01:41:19,368
Tape!

1324
01:41:19,538 --> 01:41:20,788
Never mind.

1325
01:41:22,875 --> 01:41:25,465
Drax, do you have any tape?

1326
01:41:26,211 --> 01:41:28,171
Yes, Scotch tape would work.

1327
01:41:28,463 --> 01:41:30,423
Then why did you ask me
if Scotch tape would work,

1328
01:41:30,507 --> 01:41:32,007
if you don't have any?

1329
01:41:33,010 --> 01:41:34,140
Nobody has any tape!

1330
01:41:34,303 --> 01:41:35,853
Not a single person has tape?

1331
01:41:36,221 --> 01:41:37,221
Nope!

1332
01:41:37,389 --> 01:41:38,559
Did you ask Nebula?

1333
01:41:39,433 --> 01:41:40,143
Yes!

1334
01:41:40,309 --> 01:41:41,519
Are you sure?

1335
01:41:41,685 --> 01:41:42,975
I asked Yondu...

1336
01:41:43,145 --> 01:41:45,456
- and she was sitting next to him.
- I knew you were lying!

1337
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:47,667
You have priceless batteries
and an atomic bomb in your bag.

1338
01:41:47,691 --> 01:41:50,071
If anybody's gonna have tape, it's you!

1339
01:41:50,235 --> 01:41:53,735
That's exactly my point!
I have to do everything!

1340
01:41:53,947 --> 01:41:56,447
You are wasting a lot of time here!

1341
01:42:02,789 --> 01:42:04,789
We're all gonna die.

1342
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:08,630
Rear thrusters are out again!

1343
01:42:08,795 --> 01:42:11,585
We're done for without that generator!

1344
01:42:24,853 --> 01:42:26,103
Guardians...

1345
01:42:26,897 --> 01:42:28,567
perhaps it will provide you solace...

1346
01:42:28,732 --> 01:42:31,402
that your deaths
are not without purpose.

1347
01:42:31,902 --> 01:42:33,572
They will serve as a warning...

1348
01:42:33,737 --> 01:42:35,987
to all of those tempted
with betraying us.

1349
01:42:36,532 --> 01:42:39,332
Don't screw with the Sovereign.

1350
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:44,160
This is gonna hurt.

1351
01:42:44,331 --> 01:42:45,961
Promises, promises.

1352
01:42:56,301 --> 01:42:57,301
Hey!

1353
01:43:08,939 --> 01:43:09,939
No!

1354
01:43:10,524 --> 01:43:12,654
No! No! No!

1355
01:43:18,115 --> 01:43:19,125
We're gonna blow!

1356
01:43:24,371 --> 01:43:26,411
Peter! No!

1357
01:43:46,226 --> 01:43:47,226
What?

1358
01:43:47,561 --> 01:43:49,561
You look like Mary Poppins.

1359
01:43:49,730 --> 01:43:51,150
Is he cool?

1360
01:43:52,941 --> 01:43:54,651
Hell, yeah, he's cool.

1361
01:43:55,319 --> 01:43:57,279
I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!

1362
01:44:24,598 --> 01:44:26,678
Mantis, look out!

1363
01:44:38,737 --> 01:44:40,407
She's just unconscious.

1364
01:44:56,380 --> 01:44:57,920
How long until the bomb goes off?

1365
01:44:58,090 --> 01:45:00,430
In the unlikely event
that Groot doesn't kill us all...

1366
01:45:00,592 --> 01:45:01,842
about six minutes.

1367
01:45:06,807 --> 01:45:09,307
Kraglin, we need the quadrant
for an extraction.

1368
01:45:09,476 --> 01:45:10,476
T-minus five minutes.

1369
01:45:10,644 --> 01:45:11,814
Aye, Captain.

1370
01:45:15,649 --> 01:45:17,569
Somebody's gotta be up top
when Kraglin arrives.

1371
01:45:18,861 --> 01:45:20,401
Drax, take Mantis.

1372
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:24,620
My nipples!

1373
01:45:32,749 --> 01:45:34,079
Gamora!

1374
01:45:37,713 --> 01:45:38,843
Peter!

1375
01:46:05,073 --> 01:46:06,493
Get over it.

1376
01:46:06,867 --> 01:46:10,747
Come now, Peter.
I know this isn't what you want.

1377
01:46:12,748 --> 01:46:17,248
What kind of father would I be
to let you make this choice?

1378
01:46:46,698 --> 01:46:47,818
Yeah!

1379
01:46:48,784 --> 01:46:52,414
Soon, Peter, we will be all there is.

1380
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:56,290
So stop pissing me off!

1381
01:47:16,395 --> 01:47:18,035
We have to get up
to the extraction point!

1382
01:47:26,113 --> 01:47:27,113
Go!

1383
01:49:26,567 --> 01:49:28,147
I told you...

1384
01:49:28,318 --> 01:49:32,238
I don't want to do this alone.

1385
01:49:35,450 --> 01:49:36,450
You cannot deny...

1386
01:49:36,618 --> 01:49:40,958
the purpose the universe
has bestowed upon you.

1387
01:49:50,048 --> 01:49:51,838
Everyone, I need you to stay back!

1388
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:53,050
What is that?

1389
01:50:08,734 --> 01:50:11,034
It doesn't need to be like this, Peter.

1390
01:50:13,071 --> 01:50:16,201
Why are you destroying our chance?

1391
01:50:18,827 --> 01:50:21,957
Stop pretending you
aren't what you are.

1392
01:50:23,874 --> 01:50:24,874
One in billions.

1393
01:50:26,585 --> 01:50:28,425
Trillions. Even more.

1394
01:50:30,756 --> 01:50:35,136
What greater meaning
can life possibly have to offer?

1395
01:50:37,804 --> 01:50:41,984
I don't use my head
to fly the arrow, boy!

1396
01:50:42,476 --> 01:50:44,346
I use my heart...

1397
01:51:19,596 --> 01:51:23,386
You shouldn't have killed my mom,
and squished my Walkman.

1398
01:51:23,559 --> 01:51:27,099
And if you don't love me now

1399
01:51:27,271 --> 01:51:29,691
You will never love me again

1400
01:51:29,857 --> 01:51:32,687
I can still hear you saying

1401
01:51:32,860 --> 01:51:36,780
You would never break the chain

1402
01:51:36,947 --> 01:51:38,987
And if you don't love me now

1403
01:51:39,157 --> 01:51:41,827
You will never love me again

1404
01:51:42,452 --> 01:51:46,622
I can still hear you saying

1405
01:51:46,790 --> 01:51:49,580
You would never break the chain

1406
01:51:49,751 --> 01:51:52,301
And if you don't love me now

1407
01:51:52,462 --> 01:51:55,342
You will never love me again

1408
01:51:55,507 --> 01:52:00,967
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain

1409
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:06,430
Groot? If you can hear me,
hurry up!

1410
01:52:06,602 --> 01:52:09,852
I'm not sure how long Quill
can keep him distracted!

1411
01:52:10,230 --> 01:52:11,820
Groot, hurry!

1412
01:53:07,579 --> 01:53:09,829
Yondu, we're about to blow!

1413
01:53:09,998 --> 01:53:11,458
Get to the ship!

1414
01:53:11,625 --> 01:53:12,675
Not without Quill!

1415
01:53:12,835 --> 01:53:15,005
You need to take care of the twig!

1416
01:53:16,255 --> 01:53:18,055
Not without you!

1417
01:53:19,216 --> 01:53:22,506
I ain't done nothin' right
my whole damn life, rat.

1418
01:53:25,889 --> 01:53:28,099
You need to give me this.

1419
01:53:38,318 --> 01:53:40,818
A spacesuit and an aero-rig.

1420
01:53:40,988 --> 01:53:43,158
I only have one of each.

1421
01:53:55,419 --> 01:53:57,089
I am Groot.

1422
01:53:57,838 --> 01:53:58,918
What's that?

1423
01:54:00,549 --> 01:54:04,759
He says, "Welcome to the frickin'
Guardians of the Galaxy."

1424
01:54:05,345 --> 01:54:07,715
Only he didn't use "frickin'."

1425
01:54:13,979 --> 01:54:15,059
Bye, twig.

1426
01:54:16,982 --> 01:54:20,612
We're gonna need to have
a real discussion about your language.

1427
01:55:15,249 --> 01:55:16,249
Where's Peter?

1428
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Rocket, where is he?

1429
01:55:19,753 --> 01:55:20,753
Rocket.

1430
01:55:20,879 --> 01:55:22,459
Rocket, look at me! Where is he?

1431
01:55:28,846 --> 01:55:31,216
No. I'm not leaving without him.

1432
01:55:38,188 --> 01:55:39,188
I'm sorry.

1433
01:55:40,023 --> 01:55:42,863
I can only afford to lose one
friend today.

1434
01:55:43,402 --> 01:55:44,402
Kraglin, go!

1435
01:55:45,237 --> 01:55:46,237
Wait...

1436
01:55:46,989 --> 01:55:48,569
Is Quill back?

1437
01:55:50,075 --> 01:55:52,615
Rocket, where's Quill?

1438
01:55:53,662 --> 01:55:57,082
Rocket, where's Quill?

1439
01:55:58,083 --> 01:55:59,333
Rocket!

1440
01:56:00,419 --> 01:56:01,419
Where's Quill?

1441
01:56:03,422 --> 01:56:05,422
Where's Quill?

1442
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:15,890
No, we need to stop it.

1443
01:56:21,064 --> 01:56:22,074
Stop.

1444
01:56:22,858 --> 01:56:24,478
Stop. Listen to me!

1445
01:56:24,651 --> 01:56:26,241
You are a god.

1446
01:56:27,654 --> 01:56:28,994
If you kill me...

1447
01:56:29,156 --> 01:56:31,776
you'll be just like everybody else.

1448
01:56:32,826 --> 01:56:34,446
What's so wrong with that?

1449
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:35,620
No!

1450
01:57:26,255 --> 01:57:30,015
He may have been your father, boy,
but he wasn't your daddy.

1451
01:57:34,346 --> 01:57:36,676
I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.

1452
01:57:37,766 --> 01:57:40,056
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.

1453
01:57:43,814 --> 01:57:45,154
What?

1454
01:57:56,910 --> 01:57:58,080
Yondu, what are you doing?

1455
01:57:58,245 --> 01:57:59,415
You can't.

1456
01:58:00,122 --> 01:58:01,872
Yondu!

1457
01:58:07,462 --> 01:58:09,052
No!

1458
01:58:13,635 --> 01:58:14,635
No!

1459
01:58:17,890 --> 01:58:20,480
No! No!

1460
01:58:21,768 --> 01:58:23,058
No!

1461
01:59:17,866 --> 01:59:19,276
I told Gamora...

1462
01:59:19,451 --> 01:59:23,371
how when I was a kid I used to pretend
David Hasselhoff was my dad.

1463
01:59:26,124 --> 01:59:28,844
He's a singer and actor from Earth,
really famous guy.

1464
01:59:30,337 --> 01:59:32,257
Earlier, it struck me...

1465
01:59:33,465 --> 01:59:37,585
Yondu didn't have a talking car,
but he did have a flying arrow.

1466
01:59:38,178 --> 01:59:40,308
He didn't have the beautiful voice
of an angel...

1467
01:59:40,472 --> 01:59:42,772
but he did have the whistle of one.

1468
01:59:42,933 --> 01:59:46,443
Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff
went on kick-ass adventures...

1469
01:59:46,603 --> 01:59:49,113
and hooked up with hot women...

1470
01:59:49,273 --> 01:59:51,273
and fought robots.

1471
01:59:53,944 --> 01:59:57,954
I guess David Hasselhoff did
kind of end up being my dad after all.

1472
01:59:58,115 --> 01:59:59,285
Only it was you, Yondu.

1473
02:00:05,873 --> 02:00:07,793
I had a pretty cool dad.

1474
02:00:10,794 --> 02:00:13,464
What I'm trying to say here is...

1475
02:00:14,464 --> 02:00:19,144
sometimes that thing you're searching
for your whole life...

1476
02:00:21,471 --> 02:00:23,811
it's right there by your side all along.

1477
02:00:23,974 --> 02:00:25,814
You don't even know it.

1478
02:00:37,863 --> 02:00:39,323
I am Groot.

1479
02:00:40,699 --> 02:00:42,489
He did call you twig.

1480
02:00:44,870 --> 02:00:46,200
Nebula...

1481
02:00:51,168 --> 02:00:53,168
I was a child like you.

1482
02:00:54,004 --> 02:00:58,174
I was concerned with staying alive
until the next day, every day.

1483
02:00:58,342 --> 02:01:01,302
And I never considered
what Thanos was doing to you.

1484
02:01:01,470 --> 02:01:03,220
I'm trying to make it right.

1485
02:01:03,388 --> 02:01:04,808
There are little girls like you...

1486
02:01:04,973 --> 02:01:07,813
across the universe who are in danger.

1487
02:01:10,479 --> 02:01:12,019
You can stay with us and help them.

1488
02:01:12,648 --> 02:01:15,028
I will help them by killing Thanos.

1489
02:01:15,192 --> 02:01:17,192
I don't know if that's possible.

1490
02:01:32,084 --> 02:01:34,214
You will always be my sister.

1491
02:02:18,589 --> 02:02:19,589
Pete!

1492
02:02:23,218 --> 02:02:24,968
Captain found this for you
in a junker shop.

1493
02:02:25,137 --> 02:02:27,967
Said you'd come back
to the fold someday.

1494
02:02:29,766 --> 02:02:30,926
What is it?

1495
02:02:31,101 --> 02:02:32,101
It's called a Zune.

1496
02:02:32,227 --> 02:02:34,080
It's what everybody's listening
to on Earth nowadays.

1497
02:02:34,104 --> 02:02:35,654
It's got 300 songs on it.

1498
02:02:35,814 --> 02:02:38,114
300 songs?

1499
02:02:43,238 --> 02:02:44,408
Wait.

1500
02:02:50,454 --> 02:02:52,334
Rocket grabbed the pieces,
and reassembled them.

1501
02:02:52,456 --> 02:02:54,916
I think Yondu would want you to have it.

1502
02:02:58,337 --> 02:02:59,667
Thanks...

1503
02:03:01,507 --> 02:03:02,797
Captain.

1504
02:03:41,839 --> 02:03:44,629
It's not time to make a change

1505
02:03:45,676 --> 02:03:49,296
Just relax, take it easy

1506
02:03:49,471 --> 02:03:53,181
You're still young, that's your fault

1507
02:03:53,350 --> 02:03:56,310
There's so much you have to know

1508
02:03:56,478 --> 02:04:00,648
Find a girl, settle down

1509
02:04:00,816 --> 02:04:03,936
If you want you can marry

1510
02:04:04,111 --> 02:04:09,531
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy

1511
02:04:14,872 --> 02:04:16,212
They came.

1512
02:04:24,214 --> 02:04:25,674
What is it?

1513
02:04:26,341 --> 02:04:30,471
I sent word to Yondu's old Ravager
buddies, and told them what he did.

1514
02:04:34,057 --> 02:04:35,887
It's a Ravager funeral.

1515
02:04:53,327 --> 02:04:54,327
Yeah!

1516
02:04:54,912 --> 02:04:56,372
Yeah!

1517
02:05:03,712 --> 02:05:05,592
He didn't let us down
after all, Captain.

1518
02:05:06,548 --> 02:05:08,338
No, he did not, son.

1519
02:05:09,343 --> 02:05:10,763
He did not.

1520
02:05:17,434 --> 02:05:20,854
Fare thee well, old friend.

1521
02:05:23,065 --> 02:05:27,905
Yondu Udonta, I will see you
in the stars.

1522
02:05:31,949 --> 02:05:33,949
He didn't chase them away.

1523
02:05:34,117 --> 02:05:35,197
No.

1524
02:05:36,245 --> 02:05:38,375
Even though he yelled at them.

1525
02:05:38,539 --> 02:05:40,039
And was always mean.

1526
02:05:42,626 --> 02:05:44,746
And he stole batteries he didn't need.

1527
02:05:50,384 --> 02:05:51,934
Well, of course not.

1528
02:06:16,159 --> 02:06:17,329
What?

1529
02:06:17,995 --> 02:06:19,125
It's just...

1530
02:06:21,790 --> 02:06:24,500
some unspoken thing.

1531
02:06:33,594 --> 02:06:35,684
It's beautiful.

1532
02:06:37,181 --> 02:06:38,351
It is.

1533
02:06:39,850 --> 02:06:42,020
And so are you.

1534
02:06:43,979 --> 02:06:45,189
On the inside.

1535
02:06:52,029 --> 02:06:53,859
Now there's a way

1536
02:06:54,031 --> 02:06:58,031
And I know that I have to go away

1537
02:06:59,703 --> 02:07:02,213
I know I have to go

1538
02:08:41,305 --> 02:08:42,395
You know, it's a shame...

1539
02:08:42,556 --> 02:08:46,936
that it took the tragedy of losing Yondu
to bring us all together again.

1540
02:08:47,102 --> 02:08:50,312
But I think he'd be proud knowing
that we are back as a team.

1541
02:08:50,981 --> 02:08:51,981
I'm in.

1542
02:08:52,149 --> 02:08:53,149
Dope.

1543
02:08:53,275 --> 02:08:55,325
I miss you guys so much!

1544
02:08:55,485 --> 02:08:56,735
Hell, yes.

1545
02:08:59,781 --> 02:09:01,781
What say we steal some shit?

1546
02:11:20,881 --> 02:11:22,801
High Priestess, the Council is waiting.

1547
02:11:24,051 --> 02:11:27,141
They are perturbed
I've wasted our resources.

1548
02:11:31,808 --> 02:11:34,768
When they see
what I have created here...

1549
02:11:34,937 --> 02:11:36,977
their wrath will dissipate.

1550
02:11:38,148 --> 02:11:41,148
It's a new type of birthing pod, ma'am?

1551
02:11:42,569 --> 02:11:43,779
That, my child...

1552
02:11:43,946 --> 02:11:45,906
is the next step in our evolution.

1553
02:11:46,073 --> 02:11:49,123
More powerful, more beautiful...

1554
02:11:49,284 --> 02:11:53,464
more capable of destroying
the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1555
02:11:55,999 --> 02:11:58,589
I think I shall call him...

1556
02:12:00,337 --> 02:12:01,837
Adam.

1557
02:14:04,378 --> 02:14:05,378
Dude.

1558
02:14:06,088 --> 02:14:07,628
Seriously?

1559
02:14:07,798 --> 02:14:09,798
You gotta clean up your room.
It's a complete mess.

1560
02:14:09,883 --> 02:14:11,303
I am Groot.

1561
02:14:11,468 --> 02:14:13,388
I am not boring. You're boring.

1562
02:14:13,554 --> 02:14:14,554
You know what's boring?

1563
02:14:14,638 --> 02:14:17,718
Sitting there,
playing that mind-numbing game.

1564
02:14:17,891 --> 02:14:21,601
What's boring is me tripping over
your vines every day!

1565
02:14:22,062 --> 02:14:23,232
I'm not boring!

1566
02:14:23,397 --> 02:14:24,477
I am Groot.

1567
02:14:26,149 --> 02:14:28,649
And now I know how Yondu felt.

1568
02:15:04,438 --> 02:15:06,648
In these times of hardship...

1569
02:15:07,774 --> 02:15:09,864
just remember...

1570
02:15:10,444 --> 02:15:14,494
We. Are. Groot.

1571
02:15:17,784 --> 02:15:18,954
Hey, fellas.

1572
02:15:19,119 --> 02:15:20,789
Wait, where are you going?

1573
02:15:20,954 --> 02:15:23,374
You were supposed to be my lift home.

1574
02:15:23,540 --> 02:15:25,170
How will I get out of here?

1575
02:15:25,334 --> 02:15:26,544
Hey! Aw, gee...

1576
02:15:26,710 --> 02:15:29,460
I've got so many more stories to tell.

1577
02:15:29,630 --> 02:15:30,880
Aw, guys.

1578
02:15:31,048 --> 02:15:33,378
Oh, gee...
