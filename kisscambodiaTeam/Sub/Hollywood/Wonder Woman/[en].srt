1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:09,630
Watch on kisskh.me

2
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:20,318
<i>Some days,
my childhood feels so very far away.</i>

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,620
<i>And others,</i>

4
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:25,857
I can almost see it.

5
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,526
<i>The magical land of my youth,</i>

6
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:33,965
like a beautiful dream of when the
whole world felt like a promise

7
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:38,503
and the lessons that lay ahead
yet unseen.

8
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:42,340
Looking back,
I wish I'd listened.

9
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:45,076
Wish I'd watched more closely

10
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:47,145
and understood.

11
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:50,648
But sometimes you can't see
what you're learning

12
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,820
until you come out
the other side.

13
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:44,704
Come on!

14
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,822
Come on!

15
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:10,330
Come on!

16
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:48,034
I'm gonna miss out.

17
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,137
I've seen this contest

18
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:56,707
humble even the most
seasoned warriors, Diana.

19
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,444
I can do it.

20
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,612
Just do your best.

21
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:03,047
And remember,

22
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,983
greatness is not
what you think.

23
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,087
Pace yourself and watch.

24
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,592
No!

25
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,233
No!

26
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,703
That's not fair!

27
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:32,703
No.

28
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,538
No. But...

29
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,907
- You took the short path.
- But...

30
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,542
- You cheated, Diana.
- No.

31
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:39,610
But that...

32
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,979
That is the truth.

33
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,380
That is the only truth,

34
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,583
and truth is all there is.

35
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,051
But I would've won,
if you didn't...

36
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,086
But you didn't.

37
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:53,357
You cannot be the winner,
because you are not ready to win,

38
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,326
and there is no shame in that.

39
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:00,164
Only in knowing
the truth in your heart

40
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,466
and not accepting it.

41
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:06,205
No true hero is born from lies.

42
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,844
Your time will come, Diana.

43
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,648
When?

44
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:19,318
When you're ready.

45
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,755
Look to the
Golden Warrior Asteria.

46
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:27,491
She did not become a legend
out of haste.

47
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:31,328
She did it through
true acts of bravery.

48
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,698
Like patience, diligence,

49
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,170
and the courage
to face the truth.

50
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:48,112
One day, you'll become
all that you dream of and more,

51
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:51,782
and everything
will be different.

52
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:57,256
This world is not yet ready
for all that you will do.

53
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,280
Welcome to the future.

54
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:26,350
Life is good,
but it can be better.

55
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,985
And why shouldn't it be?

56
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,753
Everything we've
ever dreamed about

57
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,722
is right at our fingertips.

58
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,391
But are you
reaping the rewards?

59
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:35,626
Do you...

60
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,263
...have it all?

61
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,600
Slow down, dude.

62
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:44,637
No way.

63
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,150
Dude!

64
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,386
[MaxwelWelcome to
Black Gold Cooperative.

65
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,254
- Oh, my gosh. Guys!
- The first oil company

66
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,490
run for the people,
by the people.

67
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:07,958
Think about finally having

68
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,260
everything you've
always wished for.

69
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:11,361
Let's go!

70
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:12,898
Hey!

71
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,300
For a low monthly fee,

72
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,001
you can own a piece

73
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:21,138
of the most lucrative industry
in the world.

74
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,507
And every time we strike gold,

75
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,375
- you strike gold.
- Oh!

76
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:37,154
No matter who you
are, no matter what you do,

77
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,990
you deserve to have it all.

78
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:43,594
Do you have everything
you've ever wanted?

79
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,930
Aren't you tired of
always wishing you had more?

80
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,433
- Hey, move it. It's my turn.
- Join me today.

81
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,401
- Yes!
- Operators are standing by.

82
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:55,706
You don't need a pile of money or
some business degree to get started.

83
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,808
You don't even have
to work hard for it.

84
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,843
Good morning.

85
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,745
- Good morning.
- Don't even think about it.

86
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:04,848
At Black Gold
Cooperative, all you need

87
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,552
is to want it!

88
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:13,257
We get what we want,
and we go.

89
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,959
- What do you want?
- None of this junk.

90
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,928
Word is on the street

91
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,397
you got a nice little black market
side business going on back there.

92
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,434
If you don't tell,
we won't tell.

93
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,706
Yes, yes, yes!

94
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:33,379
Oh, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

95
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,882
Yes, yes, yes!

96
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,098
Sir, are you all right?

97
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,065
Gun!

98
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,800
He's got a gun!

99
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:59,937
Shut up! Please!

100
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,538
Come on, dude. Can't hide.
Let's get out of here!

101
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,373
Stop! Mall Security!

102
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,175
No, no, you, you, right there!

103
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,244
Right there! Freeze. Stop!

104
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,545
Move, move, move!

105
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:09,715
Chief, they're running up
the escalator.

106
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,017
Hey! Stop! Freeze!

107
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:13,817
Freeze!

108
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,285
No!

109
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,624
We have several
armed assailants running free.

110
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,626
We need the police here,
right now.

111
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,166
Freeze!

112
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,234
Freeze! Freeze!

113
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,369
Whoa, whoa! Hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

114
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,871
No. Dude, dude, calm...

115
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,572
- Get back, man. I'll do it!
- Hey!

116
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:36,940
Hey, what are you doing?

117
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,508
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

118
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,676
What are you doing?

119
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,045
Hey, what are you doing?

120
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,981
- I'm not going back!
- No, no, no!

121
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,450
Just chill out.
Just chill.

122
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,619
- Stand back!
- Don't do it!

123
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,420
No, no, no!

124
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,356
Put the kid back.

125
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,824
Listen to me.

126
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,326
Listen to me!

127
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,628
- No!
- What are you doing?

128
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,163
Pull her back.
Pull her back in!

129
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,365
I'm not going back!

130
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,566
No!

131
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,734
Gonna let her go!

132
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,471
- No, no, no!
- No, no!

133
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:14,613
What? Who? What?

134
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:27,993
We won't be doing that today.

135
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,577
Whoa.

136
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,118
We... We... We should go...

137
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,723
Oh, my gosh!

138
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,559
Hold tight.

139
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,769
I hate guns.

140
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,640
We've got to go now. Come on.

141
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,204
Yo.

142
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,605
I'm sorry, lady.

143
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,374
- Shh.
- I'm sorry. Okay?

144
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,576
It was his idea.

145
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,121
And the
authorities still have questions.

146
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,823
In fact, the first is
a real doozy, which is,

147
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:09,726
who exactly
even stopped this crime?

148
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,329
If the story around here
is to be believed,

149
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,331
it wasn't the police,

150
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,367
but a mysterious female savior

151
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,969
that multiple witnesses saw.

152
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,972
If this sounds familiar,
it should.

153
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:25,308
We've now had more than
a half-dozen similar sightings

154
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,812
across the greater D.C. area
in the last year.

155
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,848
Which, of course,
begs the biggest question of today,

156
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,017
who is this woman

157
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,622
and where did she come from?

158
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,765
Excuse me.
Are you waiting for someone?

159
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:58,103
No. Just me.

160
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,756
Taxi!

161
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,329
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you there.

162
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,965
Hey, we could share,
if you like?

163
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,403
No, thanks. I'll wait.

164
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,180
Oh, my.

165
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,485
- Yeah.
- Hey, Jake.

166
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,122
Jake, hi. Can you...

167
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:32,231
Hi. I know, walk much?
The latch of my...

168
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,102
Good morning.

169
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,369
Hi. Thank you.

173
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:48,411
Oh, wow.

174
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,449
I kept busy in college.

175
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:56,086
Sorry. It's these heels,
you know. It's stupid.

176
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,622
I don't know why I was gonna wear heels.
Scientists don't wear heels.

177
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:01,191
- Sometimes we do.
- Right.

178
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,393
- Right. Those are cool!
- Have a nice day.

179
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,561
I like those.

182
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:09,966
I, uh...

183
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,501
Not now, obviously.

184
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:14,304
It's morning.
But later today, or whenever.

185
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,573
Like, around...
Like, at lunchtime?

186
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,208
I have a lot of work today.

187
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,477
- But maybe some other time?
- Oh.

188
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:23,380
- Yeah, I'm busy today, too.
- Great.

189
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:27,250
Ah! Diana, do you happen to
know who a Barbara Minerva is?

190
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,152
Oh, hi, Carol. Hi.

191
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:32,222
It's me. I'm Barbara.
Remember? You hired me.

192
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,658
- Started last week.
- Oh!

193
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,992
Gemologist?

194
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:37,794
Yes. And zoologist.

195
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,796
- We had a couple interviews.
- Yeah.

196
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:43,366
Well, the FBI are gonna drop off
some artifacts later this afternoon.

197
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:44,601
The FBI?

198
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,636
- Yeah. Yes.
- They're coming here?

199
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,238
The mall heist yesterday,

200
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,440
apparently they were using
a jewelry store as a front.

201
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,142
Front for what?

202
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,145
Black market. Stolen jewels and
art meant for private buyers.

203
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,280
But we could use your help
identifying one in particular.

204
00:21:57,282 --> 00:22:00,083
My help?
Yeah, I'll help the FBI

205
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:01,951
with whatever they need.

206
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,153
Is that a yes?

207
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,521
Yes. I would, um...

208
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,690
- I would love to assist you.
- Wonderful.

209
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,825
It's nice to meet you.

210
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,495
We've met.

211
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,596
Have a nice day.

212
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:14,966
Bye, Diana.

213
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:21,171
Okay, item number 23.

214
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,141
Shoot. That's not it.

215
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:31,047
Oh, the Empress of Siam.

216
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:35,120
Originally found in the wreck
of the Nuestra Senora de Atocha.

217
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,953
Wow.

218
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:40,457
Sorry. I couldn't resist
coming to see.

219
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,327
Oh, it's okay.

220
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,361
Here it is.

221
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,965
- What is it?
- Um...

222
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,267
Uh...

223
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,037
I can't tell.

224
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,241
Some light.

225
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:03,213
I think the technical term here
is "extremely lame."

226
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,482
Um...

227
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,784
It's... It's citrine.

228
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:11,654
A classic stone used in fakes
throughout history.

229
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:15,625
I can't imagine this is worth
any more than $75.

230
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:16,960
What do you think?

231
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,498
Fakes aren't my forte,
but let me see.

232
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:21,498
Mmm.

233
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,732
Latin.

234
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,601
At least
it's an antique, right?

235
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:27,704
Or a purchase from a stall
on the Ponte Vecchio last week.

236
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,973
- Mmm-hmm.
- You never know.

237
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:33,510
"Place upon the object held

238
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,145
but one great wish."

239
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,546
You read Latin?

240
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:39,616
Yeah. Yeah.
Languages are a hobby.

241
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,651
So maybe it's, like,
a lucky charm or something?

242
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:42,919
Yeah, I guess.

243
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,354
Strange.

244
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,324
I really wish I had a coffee.

245
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,125
You're funny.

246
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,593
Hey, I got Erika a coffee, but she's
out sick. Does anybody want this?

247
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,331
What?
Yeah, I'll take one.

248
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,064
Ooh, hot!

249
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:56,132
Hot, hot!

250
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:57,636
Did you see that?

251
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,339
Oh...

252
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,140
Can you imagine?

253
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:06,445
- If only.
- Hmm.

254
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:12,050
So many things,
I don't even know what I would wish for.

255
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,523
I do.

256
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:24,260
Well, um, anyway,
sorry to bother you.

257
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,896
If you need anything,
I'm around.

258
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:28,298
- Oh, yeah, I'm good.
- Yeah.

259
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,066
But thank you for...

260
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,168
That's okay. It's my job.

261
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,037
And I'll look into it more
when I have a chance.

262
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,138
Okay.

263
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,041
Well, thanks for...

264
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:40,710
talking to me.

265
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:42,647
I'm... I'm sorry, uh...

266
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:45,482
I mean, I'm fine.

267
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,650
You know, we could go
and grab early dinner

268
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:52,789
and talk about exactly
how lame that stone is.

269
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:53,923
Really?

270
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,458
Yeah, I mean, citrine?

271
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,894
Who are they kidding, right?

272
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,229
- So lame.
- Dorky.

273
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:00,630
- Lame.
- Yeah, let's go.

274
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,268
That's, like,
the lamest of lames.

275
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,998
Wow. You're so funny.

276
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,100
- Oh. Thank you.
- Wow.

277
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:40,904
I mean, no one's made me laugh
like this in such a long time.

278
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,306
I mean, it's true,
I don't get out much socially.

279
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,041
You don't get out much?

280
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,342
No, not really.

281
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:47,911
- No.
- I'm sorry. I'm just surprised.

282
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,346
Because you just seem like
the kind of person

283
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:51,881
who's, like, always out.

284
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,017
Like, people are asking you
to go out all the time

285
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,286
and you live out.
You're just out.

286
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,788
Like, you never get in.

287
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,624
You just seem
like you'd be really popular.

288
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,793
And I would know because
I've never been popular.

289
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:04,961
You haven't?

290
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:06,529
You're so personable.

291
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:09,566
So... free.

292
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:13,102
I mean, honestly,
I gotta say that I envy that.

293
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:14,470
What?

294
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:17,206
You envy me?
That doesn't make any sense.

295
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,375
Oh, my gosh.

296
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:21,644
People think I'm weird.
They avoid me

297
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:24,514
and talk behind my back when
they don't think I can hear them.

298
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,551
I'm like, "Guys,
I can hear you."

299
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:32,822
Barbara, my life

300
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:36,294
hasn't been
what you probably think it has.

301
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,662
We all have our struggles.

302
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:40,665
Yeah, we do.

303
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,502
Have you ever been in love?

304
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:49,105
Uh... Yeah.

305
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,708
- A long, long time ago.
- Mmm.

306
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,809
You?

307
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:55,111
So many times, yeah.
All the time.

308
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,879
Often.

309
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,114
So what happened?

310
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,450
Where'd he go, your guy?

311
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,920
He, uh...

312
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,754
He died.

313
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:10,259
But I still think sometimes that
I see him up there in the sky.

314
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:11,494
He was a pilot.

315
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:14,631
- Oh!
- He was all kinds of things,

316
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:18,370
but he was great. It was true.

317
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,005
I get it.

318
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,374
Well, cheers to us.

319
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:27,646
Wishing us better luck,
I guess.

320
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,252
Hey, Leon.

321
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:37,920
Hey there, Barbara. Late night?

322
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,522
Yeah. Going back to work.

323
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:41,624
I wanted to bring this to you
while it was still hot.

324
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:44,594
- Oh, you're too good to me.
- It's not a problem.

325
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:45,930
Stay warm.

326
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:58,207
Hey there, sweetheart.
You need some help?

327
00:27:58,209 --> 00:27:59,644
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

328
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:02,211
'Cause, uh,

329
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:05,181
you know, you look as though you're
having a little bit of trouble

330
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,482
walking in those heels, huh?

331
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:07,784
It's okay. I wear
these heels all the time.

332
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,719
Hey, come on.
Let me walk you home.

333
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:12,255
- I'm not going home.
- Hey, I'm just trying to be nice here.

334
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,724
Huh? Come on.

335
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:18,695
Hey, hey. Hey, hey!

336
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,263
- What are you doing?
- Hey, hey!

337
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:21,931
Let go of me!

338
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:23,299
- I'm just trying to help you!
- Let go of me! Let go of me!

339
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:25,804
Let go!

340
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:41,718
Forgot my keys. Lucky.

341
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,686
- How did you...
- Simple self-defense.

342
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,855
Used his own momentum against him.
I'll teach you.

343
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:48,393
Honestly, it takes
no power at all.

344
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:50,593
Are you okay?

345
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:53,296
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Good.

346
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:54,864
- Thank you.
- Of course.

347
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,099
Go home, okay?

348
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:57,936
- Yeah.
- Good night.

349
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:39,544
I do know what I'd wish for.

350
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,616
To be like Diana.

351
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:49,385
Strong, sexy,

352
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:51,556
cool.

353
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,728
Special.

354
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,489
Oh...

355
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,020
Oh, no! Oh!

356
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:32,457
Sorry.

357
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:34,790
Oh, it's okay.

358
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:36,359
Barbara, thank God
you're good in heels.

359
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:37,962
Oh.

360
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,564
- Hey, Barbara.
- Hi, Jake.

361
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,566
Wow. Looking good.

362
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,768
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah.

363
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,873
This is our
Earth Sciences lab.

364
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,907
Oh, Barbara!

365
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:51,976
Hi.

366
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,377
Perfect.

367
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:55,845
I have someone
I would like you to meet.

368
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,514
- A pleasure, Ms. Minerva.
- Oh.

369
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:01,450
Uh,
it's "Doctor," actually.

370
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:03,653
Um... Have we met before?
You look familiar.

371
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:06,422
- Do the thing. Do the thing.
- No.

372
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,525
Life is good,
but it can be better.

373
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,328
Oh, my gosh. From TV.

374
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,930
Oh, my gosh.
You're the oil guy.

375
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,399
- "The oil guy." I'll take it.
- That's right.

376
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:19,602
Mr. Lord is considering

377
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,171
becoming a Friend of the
Smithsonian at the Partner level.

378
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:24,040
- Oh.
- Which entitles him to a handful

379
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:25,408
of private tours
of our facilities,

380
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,910
and he asked for you by name.

381
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:30,646
- Me?
- Well, what can I say, Doctor?

382
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:32,381
Your reputation precedes you.

383
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:36,519
And apparently we share
a passion for gemology.

384
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,388
- Wow, okay. We do.
- I'll leave you to it.

385
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,923
Uh...

386
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:43,526
Oh, let me just drop this off
in my office,

387
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,596
and we'll go.

388
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:09,821
Oh! Oh, gosh. Don't look in there.
It's such a mess.

389
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:14,959
So, I thought maybe
we could start upstairs.

390
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,731
I love that ruby.

391
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:22,999
Oh, no. Be careful with that.

392
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,767
- What?
- That's very...

393
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:29,005
Hey, have you seen
my friend? Where'd he go?

394
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,473
- I'm right here.
- You are.

395
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,074
Thank God.

396
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,576
Oh, wait. You've got
a little dust on you.

397
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:34,944
- Sorry.
- Hey, good morning.

398
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:35,878
Oh, hi.

399
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,380
- Hi.
- Oh! Uh...

400
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:39,982
This is the one and only,

401
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:41,986
Mr. Maxwell Lord.

402
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,822
It's him.

403
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,291
Life is good,

404
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,026
but it can be better.

405
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,396
He's from TV.

406
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,797
Oh, I don't have a TV.

407
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,365
Well, I have a great
relationship with Sears.

408
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,667
I can get you a brand-new TV
by the end of the day.

409
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,469
Nineteen inches.

410
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:03,039
- No strings attached.
- I'll stick to the one I don't have.

411
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,473
But thank you.

412
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:05,574
Okay.

413
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:08,344
You're so generous. Um...

414
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,146
Headline... Uh...

415
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:11,313
Mr. Lord

416
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:14,717
took a tour
of the entire Smithsonian

417
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,685
while considering partnership,

418
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:19,221
and guess
what he decided to do?

419
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,223
Give his entire donation

420
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,259
to our department.

421
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,528
He's announcing it
at tonight's Members' Gala.

422
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,996
It's going to be
an amazing party.

423
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:29,265
I hope you have
something nice to wear.

424
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,500
I actually tend
to skip these events.

425
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:35,538
I find that our benefactors with
a true eye towards philanthropy

426
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,339
prefer to stay
out of the spotlight.

427
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:40,076
To let the museum's work
garner the attention.

428
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,310
I agree.

429
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:42,445
Except,

430
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:46,182
I like to party.

431
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:49,018
Oh, my gosh.
You're such a good dancer.

432
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,286
- You like Latin dancing?
- I love it.

433
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,021
I know that
I'm a terrible dancer.

434
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:53,622
No, I doubt that
you're a terrible dancer...

435
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:55,357
No, I've got a hip injury
from high school.

436
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,392
...the shape that you're in.

437
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:57,927
Great, so,

438
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,162
- thank you so much for coming.
- Oh, yeah.

439
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:01,797
You know,
I really should be going.

440
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,032
Thank you for the tour.

441
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:06,502
I will have to see you tonight.

442
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,704
See you tonight.

443
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:11,676
Bye. Have a good day.

444
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:13,878
I'll find you.

445
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:18,416
What?

446
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,617
I like him.

447
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,128
Thank you, John.

448
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,634
Ladies.

449
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,837
Mr. Lord.

450
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,739
Not now, Raquel.
My supplements?

451
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:47,712
On your desk,
but Mr. Lord.

452
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:50,246
Mr. Lord.

453
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,254
Mr. Lord.

454
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:19,410
Mr. Lord.

455
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,611
Mr. Lord.

456
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:23,612
Dad!

457
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:24,815
How?

458
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:27,349
How!

459
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,751
It's your weekend.

460
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:30,853
Yes, clearly.

461
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,856
Alistair.

462
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,291
Where's the pool, Daddy?

463
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:37,059
It's not done yet, buddy.

464
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:39,061
But it doesn't matter.

465
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:40,896
You just have
to be patient.

466
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:43,399
I told you the pool,

467
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,967
the helicopter,

468
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,803
you'll have it all.
But remember,

469
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:50,773
Rome wasn't built in a day,
was it? No.

470
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:52,808
Hasn't it been
a lot of days?

471
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,844
Well, it takes time
to become a great, great,

472
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:59,014
number-one man,
like your dad is going to be.

473
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:02,551
Are you lying to your son,
like you lie to everyone else?

474
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,557
Simon.

475
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,660
These offices aren't ready
for guests yet.

476
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:14,063
It's over, Max.

477
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,765
I don't want to hear it anymore.
I'm out.

478
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:18,367
Alistair, go wait with Raquel.

479
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:19,303
Simon.

480
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:22,738
I know it's hard
to see right now,

481
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,507
but we are finally right at the
edge of turning this thing around.

482
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:27,276
"Turning it around"?

483
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:30,713
There is no oil.
There never was.

484
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,015
So how are you gonna
turn it around?

485
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,951
Get more
sucker investors, like me?

486
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:37,786
- It's called a Ponzi scheme.
- No!

487
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:40,022
I have a big...

488
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:42,458
There's something in the works.

489
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,326
And it's no scheme.

490
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:48,764
Simon, we have millions of acres
of potentially oil-rich land.

491
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,166
You have oil rights on land

492
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:53,269
that everyone else
passed on already.

493
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,803
Now, it didn't take
much digging

494
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:56,238
to find that out.

495
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,440
I should have
done some digging on you, too,

496
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,342
Maxwell Lorenzano.

497
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:03,545
Didn't take long to find out you're
nothing but a lowlife con man.

498
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,983
I am not a con man!

499
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:12,488
I am a television personality.

500
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,856
And a respected businessman

501
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:15,324
- with a plan.
- Come on.

502
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:18,160
- With... With... With a great plan.
- Oh!

503
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:20,829
"If you can dream it,
you can have it."

504
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,900
Something like that?

505
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:26,468
You have 48 hours

506
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,671
- to get my money...
- You're going to regret this.

507
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:31,907
...or the FTC gets an anonymous report.

508
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:33,976
- Loser.
- Simon, wait.

509
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,480
Simon, wait.

510
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,925
I am not a loser.

511
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,360
He's a loser!

512
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:54,463
And don't you ever believe
a word that man said.

513
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:56,799
He's a liar...

514
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:59,203
and he's wrong.

515
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:05,376
And he will rue the day
he walked away from me.

516
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,618
And you...

517
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:21,959
You are going to be so proud
to be my son.

518
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:25,529
Okay.

519
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:32,203
You'll see.

520
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:36,374
Everyone will.

521
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:23,051
These are known
for a terrific fit.

522
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:26,789
Yeah, I'm just
not so great with heels.

523
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,392
Just try them.

524
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,928
Come out and show me.

525
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,732
Okay. Hmm.

526
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,274
They do fit well.

527
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,175
Ah.

528
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:47,411
Huh.

529
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:53,882
- Yeah, I like it.
- You look

530
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:55,651
amazing.

531
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:56,952
Do you think it's too tight?

532
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,588
I think it's just right.

533
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,392
- Wow.
- Yeah.

534
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,462
I'll take it.

535
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:25,449
Hey there. How are you doing?

536
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:55,544
- Those shoes are incredible.
- Thank you.

537
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:58,280
- What a beautiful dress.
- You look fantastic.

538
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:00,184
Thank you so much.

539
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:10,728
Dr. Minerva.

540
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:16,433
You look breathtaking.

541
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:19,067
Thank you.

542
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:22,804
I... You know, we have to go to
these sort of things for work a lot,

543
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:25,407
so I've probably worn this
dress a million times.

544
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:26,542
Mmm.

545
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,676
Um...

546
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:30,812
- Actually, no.
- I...

547
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:32,681
I just bought this today.

548
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:35,384
I never look like this.
Um, not even close.

549
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,088
Took me a long time
to get ready.

550
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,261
Biotin.

551
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,495
You should try it.

552
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:49,097
Makes you glow like a teenager.

553
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,432
Reverses the clock.

554
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:53,602
Never accept
the limitations of nature.

555
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:54,836
Yeah, no.

556
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:57,306
Especially not
a beautiful woman like you.

557
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:58,576
Oh...

558
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:04,079
God, it's so loud in here.

559
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,482
Yeah.

560
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,550
Can we go somewhere?

561
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:10,721
- Just me and you?
- Yes.

562
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,191
Hmm... Your office?

563
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:30,973
Oh, wow! Look at all
of this stuff. It's so...

564
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:33,310
It's so beautiful.

565
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:36,780
Like you.

566
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,486
What is that?

567
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:45,587
Um...

568
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:48,657
Uh, it's nothing special,
really.

569
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:52,828
But the FBI did ask me
to help them identify it.

570
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,396
Wow.

571
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:55,897
Though it certainly
has me stumped so far.

572
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:57,766
Let me help you.

573
00:43:57,768 --> 00:44:00,769
Max is here. No need to be
stumped ever again.

574
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:03,772
I have a dear friend
in Roman antiquities.

575
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:06,375
- Roman antiquities.
- Could give it a look, if you like?

576
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:11,246
It is Latin, isn't it?

577
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:16,184
I really shouldn't let it
go out of the museum.

578
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:29,700
- Hey there, beautiful.
- No, thank you. Excuse me.

579
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,869
Oh, Diana.

580
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:34,670
Hoping I'd see you.

581
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,972
Hey, do you know
I'm at the White House now?

582
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:40,976
Yeah, that's right. Interning,
but requested by name, so...

583
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:43,879
Listen, I've had my eyes on you
for some time.

584
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:46,850
- So if you ever need...
- That's great, Carl.

585
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,356
Diana.

586
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,794
Diana.

587
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:01,465
Excuse me, I don't even know
you, so please stop following me.

588
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:08,303
- Good night.
- But...

589
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:10,674
I wish we had more time.

590
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:17,347
Why did you say that?

591
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:20,015
Don't say that to me.

592
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:21,717
You don't even know me.

593
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,954
Yes, I do.

594
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:37,432
I can save today...

595
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:40,437
but you can save the world.

596
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:50,347
Steve?

597
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,986
Diana.

598
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,722
But how?

599
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:02,860
I don't know.

600
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,834
Oh, my God.

601
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:14,505
It's you.

602
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:27,851
I missed you.

603
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:32,723
So what do you remember?

604
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:36,191
I remember...

605
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:37,893
I remember taking
the plane up...

606
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:39,194
Mmm-hmm.

607
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:41,064
...and then...

608
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,366
nothing, really.

609
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:45,934
Nothing.

610
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:48,570
But somehow, I know
I've been someplace since then.

611
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:51,441
Someplace that's, uh...

612
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,577
I can't really put words to it.

613
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:59,483
But it's... It's good.

614
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:07,823
And then I, uh...
I woke up here.

615
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:08,657
Where?

616
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:12,093
I ended up in a bed. Uh...

617
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:16,565
Strange, strange pillow bed
with slats.

618
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,400
- A futon, yeah.
- A futon?

619
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:19,901
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

620
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:24,673
Well, not comfortable.
And really a bit backwards

621
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,908
if I'm being
really honest with you.

622
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,444
I mean, for a futuristic time
like this. Nineteen...

623
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:33,150
Eighty-four. 1984.

624
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:45,927
That's amazing.

625
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:03,547
Would you like
to see my futon?

626
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:16,827
Yeah. Um...

627
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:19,861
You don't have to tell me.

628
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:24,566
The place is a mess.
Cheese on demand.

629
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:27,402
I spent all morning
cleaning his bedroom,

630
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:30,672
but he seems to me
to be an engineer.

631
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:33,141
Lots of pictures of himself.

632
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:38,947
Not what I would do,
but to each his own.

633
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:41,283
Oh, so this is
how you found me.

634
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:43,652
Yeah, the phone book.

635
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:46,321
I guess some things
are just future-proof.

636
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:47,656
So you went to my apartment?

637
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:49,157
Yeah, I tried to use
the bike at first.

638
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:54,129
I couldn't really figure out
how to get it going,

639
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:57,834
so I ran over
and saw you come back.

640
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:02,940
And I was stunned.

641
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,076
There you were.

642
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:10,745
So I just, uh...

643
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:13,183
followed you, like a creep.

644
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:19,421
Diana, look at you. It's...

645
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:23,725
It's like not one day
has passed.

646
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:26,461
I can't say the same thing
about you.

647
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:31,635
Right, right, right.
Right.

648
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:40,644
Yeah, he's, uh...

649
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:08,636
He's got it.

650
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:11,541
No, I like him.

651
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:17,147
He's great,
but all I see is you.

652
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:41,605
"One great wish."
I've been waiting.

653
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,677
I wish to be you.

654
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:52,582
The Dreamstone itself.

655
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:52,642
Hi.

656
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:55,677
Come here.

657
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:57,380
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

658
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:04,018
Been eating Pop-Tarts
all morning,

659
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,821
and I've had about
three pots of coffee.

660
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:11,027
This place is amazing.

661
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,895
- This place?
- Yeah.

662
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:16,164
You know,
if I really think about it,

663
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:19,236
I don't think I've ever been
in a room more amazing.

664
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,003
- It's true.
- Yeah.

665
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:24,105
This room is
the most amazing place

666
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:25,607
I've ever been in,
in my entire life.

667
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:27,041
It's the most
amazing place, right?

668
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:30,645
So let's stay. We shouldn't go.

669
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,981
- I really don't want to.
- So, let's not.

670
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,249
- Okay.
- Okay.

671
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:36,987
Let's just stay here.

672
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,089
Forever.

673
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:43,291
Although...

674
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:46,261
I should probably go
and figure out

675
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:51,201
how a stone brought my boyfriend
back in someone else's body.

676
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:57,874
That's a fair point. Let's go.

677
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:41,518
Whoa.

678
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:56,898
Mr. Stagg?

679
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,969
Thank you, Belinda.

680
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:00,904
Oh, God.

681
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:04,138
You'd better be here
with my money.

682
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,275
I'll have your money, Simon.
Today, I'm here for an apology.

683
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:09,844
Are you out of your mind?
I'm not going to apologize.

684
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:11,346
I'm sorry.

685
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:14,249
I messed up. I messed up.

686
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,852
I lied.

687
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:18,853
And I'm sorry.

688
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:22,090
You know, the truth is, I knew we
were going to sink a long time ago.

689
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,292
The wells were coming up dry.

690
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:27,929
And no data suggested
that was going to change.

691
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,664
I should have folded then.

692
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:32,967
But all the people that bought
in, that believed in me.

693
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:35,203
- I wanted to do right.
- Oh, come on.

694
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:37,171
Max, look, you don't have to...

695
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:41,075
Simon, don't you understand
that I wished for better?

696
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:43,611
That with every ounce
of my being,

697
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:48,118
I wished that Black Gold would
change the world for all of us.

698
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:51,452
And I know
you wished that, too.

699
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:54,324
Of course I wished that, too.

700
00:54:58,028 --> 00:55:00,094
Then your wish is granted.

701
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:02,966
And in return,
I'll take all of your shares...

702
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:06,834
and full control of Black Gold,

703
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:10,004
after you are somehow magically
removed from my path...

704
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:12,342
- You're gonna what?
- ...forever.

705
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:16,644
Max!

706
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,315
Hey, Max!

707
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:23,017
- Get back here! Max!
- Ow.

708
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:26,387
What the hell is going on?

709
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:33,594
We have a warrant
for Simon Stagg.

710
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:35,096
My word. Are we in danger?

711
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:37,131
No, sir.
Federal taxation crime.

712
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:39,069
It doesn't concern you.
Move along.

713
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:41,302
Send them through.

714
00:55:41,304 --> 00:55:43,373
- Okay. Follow me.
- Let's go, guys.

715
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:56,984
Ooh.

716
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:02,590
So you said a stone
started all of this?

717
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:05,093
Yeah, that's what we need
to go and find out.

718
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:07,762
I mean, it must have
done something.

719
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:10,698
This is dynamite.

720
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,899
What do you think?

721
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:14,302
- Yeah. Yeah...
- Huh? Right?

722
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:17,672
I saw a couple of magazine pictures.
They roll these up.

723
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:19,507
I think we can do better.

724
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:22,110
Look at all the pockets in this.
There are pockets here.

725
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:23,644
There are pockets
all over the pant.

726
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:27,315
American issue bag, adjustable.

727
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:29,050
Parachute pants?

728
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,686
- Yeah. Uh...
- Does everybody parachute now?

729
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:33,454
You know,
I'm not so keen on this one.

730
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:36,924
I figure you are, but you know
what, I'm ready to go.

731
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:37,992
Mmm-mmm.

732
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:40,528
- Right?
- No.

733
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:43,097
- You're not even giving it a second.
- It's not good.

734
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:45,833
"Too much" in a good way
or a bad way? Right?

735
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:47,504
- In a bad way.
- Oh.

736
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:50,838
Now that's great.

737
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,907
It's beautiful.

738
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,376
Yeah. I would absolutely
never wear it.

739
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:57,211
- I feel like a pirate.
- Steve.

740
00:56:57,213 --> 00:57:00,014
Who would wear this?

741
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:01,249
Diana,

742
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,784
have you seen these shoes?

743
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:05,253
- Let's keep the shoes.
- Let's keep the shoes. Yes!

744
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,556
- Let's keep the shoes.
- Yes!

745
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:18,766
This is a special one, okay?

746
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:21,037
- Let's do this together.
- Uh-huh.

747
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:25,106
One foot after the other.

748
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,041
Now stay on this one.

749
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:28,943
Go to the middle.

750
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:31,045
No, Steve...

751
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:33,082
Steve, you're gonna fall.

752
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:41,291
I really thought
I was gonna fall.

753
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,206
What's up?

754
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:20,995
This is break dance.

755
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,632
- Dancing?
- Yeah.

756
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:29,237
- Whoa!
- Oh, don't worry.

757
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:30,571
- It's fine. It's just a move.
- Yeah? Oh.

758
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:31,641
It's nothing.

759
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:39,215
It's all art.

760
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,119
Yeah.

761
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:49,457
Uh... That's just a trash can.

762
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:51,528
It's just a trash can.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

763
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:58,032
Is that a plane?

764
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,703
Come on.
I want to show you something.

765
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:23,159
This is incredible!

766
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:39,574
And every time we strike gold,

767
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,842
you strike gold.

768
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:46,614
Think about finally having
everything you've always wished for.

769
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:48,885
Raquel?

770
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,622
Raquel?

771
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:57,892
Black Gold. Can you hold, please?

772
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:02,897
Black Gold. Yes. Hold, please.

773
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:04,365
- Raquel?
- Hold, please.

774
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:05,600
The wells struck pay!

775
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,234
- Which ones?
- All of them.

776
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:09,170
And the investors
heard about it somehow.

777
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:11,639
They're calling to up their buys.
Their friends are calling to buy in.

778
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:13,941
New investors are calling
out of thin air.

779
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:15,710
Hold on, please.
I need more help.

780
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:18,514
- Black Gold. Can you hold, please?
- I'll get you help.

781
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,950
Tell me again.
You wish you had more help?

782
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,719
Yes, I wish I had more help.

783
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:26,354
There are just
too many calls to take.

784
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:28,089
Uh... Hi.

785
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:29,624
I'm sorry to bother you.

786
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,525
I'm meant to be interviewing
at an accounting firm.

787
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:33,027
- You're hired!
- Oh...

788
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:34,161
Welcome aboard!

789
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:35,930
- Emerson.
- Emerson!

790
01:00:35,932 --> 01:00:37,431
Is this the employment office?

791
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:38,835
Yes! You're hired, too!

792
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:42,169
Mr. Lord,
it's Wall Street Journal.

793
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:45,608
They want to interview you
about company's sudden surge.

794
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:49,245
I'll take it in my office.

795
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:53,781
And bring me my vitamins.

796
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:55,883
So I did read
about four books last night...

797
01:00:58,021 --> 01:00:59,286
...to try to get to the bottom of this.
And did find out, Roger, you were right.

798
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:00,755
This is from the Song Dynasty.

799
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:01,922
You were correct.

800
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:03,758
And also interesting,

801
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,528
I was looking at a couple of
encyclopedias last night and you...

802
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:08,231
Thanks. Um...

803
01:01:10,566 --> 01:01:13,768
So funny, all this reading seems
to have cured my eyesight somehow.

804
01:01:15,371 --> 01:01:17,304
- Interesting fact which we...
- Hey.

805
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:19,273
- Hi.
- Good morning.

806
01:01:19,275 --> 01:01:21,909
This is Steve. He's my, um...

807
01:01:21,911 --> 01:01:22,977
- Old friend.
- Yeah.

808
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:25,413
Hi, old friend Steve.

809
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:27,448
I'm Barbara,
Diana's new friend.

810
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,050
So what do you do?

811
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:30,818
I'm a pilot.

812
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,588
- Pilot? Isn't that...
- Can I speak to you for a second?

813
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:40,261
So, I just wanted to speak
to you about that stone.

814
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:41,829
The citrine one.

815
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:44,565
- Do you have it?
- Uh...

816
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:48,202
Long story, actually,
about that.

817
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:51,505
Max Lord came by
to visit yesterday.

818
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:53,808
Which was actually
pretty great.

819
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:56,043
I'll tell you
about it later. Um...

820
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,581
I let him

821
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:00,081
borrow it.

822
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:01,315
What? Why?

823
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:02,683
Well, Diana,

824
01:02:02,685 --> 01:02:04,285
he just gave us
a huge amount of money.

825
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,986
It's not like he's a stranger
or anything.

826
01:02:05,988 --> 01:02:07,655
Plus he has a friend who's an
expert, and I don't know...

827
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:09,590
What do you mean?
How could you loan it?

828
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:11,525
- It's not even ours to loan.
- Whoa. Whoa.

829
01:02:11,527 --> 01:02:13,761
What are you getting
on my case for?

830
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:17,364
I've got 15 things in my office
more valuable than that stone.

831
01:02:17,366 --> 01:02:19,200
Do you know where he took it?

832
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:21,669
No, I have no idea.

833
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:23,671
Then I'll tell you
what we find out.

834
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:24,905
Let's go.

835
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:27,108
- I like your pants very much.
- Oh, thanks.

836
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:28,476
Yeah. Call me.

837
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:30,978
Or not. Whatever.

838
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:33,349
But I'd be curious.

839
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:41,889
Call the Black Gold hotline.

840
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:44,727
Shares are not available
in the building.

841
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:49,330
What are these people doing?

842
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:50,631
Whatever it is,

843
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:52,702
we're not getting in that way.

844
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:57,740
Diana. Diana, this way.

845
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:08,317
Have at it.

846
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,000
Strong lock.

847
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:40,116
Steve.

848
01:03:56,432 --> 01:03:59,402
- It's so dusty.
- Yeah.

849
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:02,605
It's like a bomb went off.

850
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:17,053
Whatever this is,
he's been looking for it for a long time.

851
01:04:29,398 --> 01:04:33,169
"Place upon
the object held."

852
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:38,005
What is it?

853
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:40,708
The language of the Gods.

854
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:43,646
Which God wrote it,
is the question.

855
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:47,715
Thanks.

856
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,383
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. It's okay.

857
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:51,719
I gotta go do something. Okay.
I'll talk to you. All right?

858
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,121
- Hello?
- Barbara, I need your help.

859
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:56,123
I need you to find out

860
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:58,926
exactly where
that stone was found.

861
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:01,328
"Where" is what I need to know.
You understand?

862
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:03,464
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.

863
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:05,201
Thanks.

864
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:09,672
You look like you saw a ghost.

865
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:12,909
I did.

866
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:18,178
There were many Gods

867
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,915
and they did different things
for different reasons.

868
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:25,085
One was making
objects like this.

869
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:27,588
There are universal elements
in this world,

870
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:30,624
and when they're imbued
into something,

871
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:35,031
they can become
very, very powerful.

872
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:37,898
Like my Lasso of Truth.

873
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,401
The truth is what powers it,
not me.

874
01:05:40,403 --> 01:05:43,437
The truth is bigger
than all of us.

875
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,508
But what is this?

876
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:48,711
I don't know. Uh...

877
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:52,248
Brought me back.

878
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:57,820
Love or hope...

879
01:05:58,387 --> 01:06:00,287
maybe?

880
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:03,724
Maybe.

881
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:08,662
Well, whatever it is, I can promise you
this is too powerful for Maxwell Lord.

882
01:06:08,664 --> 01:06:10,497
We need to find this guy.

883
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:12,635
Uh...

884
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:21,909
Look at this.

885
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:24,280
If this date's right,
he's going to Cairo.

886
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:27,314
Cairo?

887
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:30,617
Yeah.
Growth opportunity, you know?

888
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:33,287
"King of Crude"?

889
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:35,224
How is this so fast?

890
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,759
You have a plane that can fly

891
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:40,361
from here to Cairo in one shot?

892
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:42,296
That is amazing.

893
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:44,832
Yeah, but we can't get you on one
because you don't have a passport.

894
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,533
I don't want to get on one,

895
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:48,369
I want to fly one.
I want to fly the plane.

896
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:49,905
I want to fly this plane.

897
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:52,108
Yeah?

898
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,935
Oh, my Betsy.

899
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:26,974
Hey, Steve, this way.

900
01:07:26,976 --> 01:07:28,709
Yeah.

901
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:32,146
Look at these gams.

902
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:42,992
You wanna choose?

903
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:47,063
This one.

904
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:49,198
I like it.

905
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:01,777
Okay.

906
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,616
Okay. Uh...

907
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:10,317
No.

908
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:12,219
Uh...

909
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:14,655
All right. Good, good.

910
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:16,790
Fuel, fuel, fuel.

911
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:18,492
Here we go. Engine.

912
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:21,897
Here goes nothing.

913
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:26,400
Oh...

914
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:39,680
- Ken?
- What?

915
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:41,348
There's an aircraft
on the runway.

916
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:42,816
What do you mean,
"There's an aircraft on the runway"?

917
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:44,218
Approach, this is Tower.

918
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,619
There's an unlisted aircraft
on the runway.

919
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:46,989
Are you seeing this?

920
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,826
- Can you get us up there?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

921
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:54,428
I just have to pick up
speed first,

922
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:56,029
and then I'll take off.

923
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:58,966
The way I fly,
they will never find us.

924
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:05,606
- Oh, I forgot to tell you.
- What?

925
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:07,007
Radar. I can't explain now,

926
01:09:07,009 --> 01:09:09,376
but they'll see us anywhere,
even in the dark.

927
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:12,114
Well, will they shoot at us?

928
01:09:13,215 --> 01:09:15,449
- Well, shit, Diana.
- Right.

929
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:24,091
- Diana.
- Wait. Shh! I know.

930
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:27,361
I know. Focus.

931
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:29,229
Focus.

932
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:31,398
My father hid Themyscira
from the world,

933
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,700
and I've been trying to learn
how he did it.

934
01:09:33,702 --> 01:09:34,902
Did what?

935
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:36,937
Made something invisible.

936
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:39,139
But in 50 years,
I've only done it once.

937
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:40,841
Well, now's not a bad time
to start trying.

938
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:42,943
- How long does it last?
- I don't know.

939
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:45,612
It was just a coffee cup...

940
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:47,283
and I lost it.

941
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:13,874
Approach,

942
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:15,042
the aircraft has vanished.

943
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,312
Do you have eyes on it?

944
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:46,976
An invisible jet.

945
01:11:09,965 --> 01:11:11,500
What's that?

946
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:14,835
Oh, it's okay.

947
01:11:14,837 --> 01:11:16,870
It's just fireworks.

948
01:11:16,872 --> 01:11:19,640
The Fourth. Of course.

949
01:11:19,642 --> 01:11:21,210
The Fourth of July?

950
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:02,918
Wow.

951
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:16,065
I got an idea.

952
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:54,201
You know, it's the one thing.

953
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:56,536
The one thing
that's always been you to me.

954
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:57,537
What?

955
01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:58,672
Flight.

956
01:12:58,674 --> 01:13:00,474
Your gift.

957
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:03,045
I'll never understand it.

958
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:05,280
Ah, it's...

959
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:08,915
It's so easy, really.

960
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:12,152
It's wind and air

961
01:13:12,154 --> 01:13:16,258
and knowing how to ride it,
how to catch it.

962
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:19,294
How to join with it.

963
01:13:20,929 --> 01:13:22,262
Yeah.

964
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:25,033
It's like anything, really.

965
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:51,558
Great, thanks.

966
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:54,628
Found the last one.

967
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:56,698
This should keep you busy
for a while.

968
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:02,037
Anything else I can get you?
Coffee?

969
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:03,904
Tea?

970
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:06,074
Me?

971
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:10,377
I don't need anything from you,
and I'm done.

972
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:12,179
You're done?

973
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:15,184
Hey, you don't have
to be mean about it.

974
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:24,057
Hey, babe.
Where you going?

975
01:14:24,059 --> 01:14:25,994
No thanks.

976
01:14:29,565 --> 01:14:31,898
Ooh, you're pretty.

977
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,102
Hey, slow down, sexy.

978
01:14:39,074 --> 01:14:40,607
You talking to me?

979
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:42,578
Yep. I'm talking to you.

980
01:14:43,712 --> 01:14:47,080
Why don't you just
slow down a bit, huh?

981
01:14:47,082 --> 01:14:49,182
Come on, girl.

982
01:14:49,184 --> 01:14:52,054
I'd rather not.
You know what I mean?

983
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:56,623
I'd rather not have anything
to do with someone like you.

984
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:59,394
I'd rather you stop
harassing people.

985
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:03,129
Like me.

986
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:04,500
Do you remember me?

987
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:09,069
Oh, yeah, yeah.

988
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:12,374
I remember.
Where were we, huh?

989
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:16,445
No.

990
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:21,748
No.

991
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:29,291
No.

992
01:15:31,393 --> 01:15:32,726
She's right.

993
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:34,995
It's not that hard.

994
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:43,338
Yeah, I think I get it now.

995
01:15:44,506 --> 01:15:46,575
His body weight
does do all the work.

996
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:52,381
So easy.

997
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:55,715
I think

998
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:57,183
I could do this...

999
01:15:59,788 --> 01:16:01,857
all...

1000
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:04,626
night...

1001
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:08,196
long!

1002
01:16:25,614 --> 01:16:27,249
Barbara?

1003
01:16:30,652 --> 01:16:32,487
What are you doing?

1004
01:16:34,823 --> 01:16:37,292
Mind your business.

1005
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,401
Sir?

1006
01:16:53,976 --> 01:16:58,845
Your fortune the last few days
has been impressive, to say the least.

1007
01:16:58,847 --> 01:17:02,551
But why come all this way
to meet with me? Hmm?

1008
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:05,251
To meet a peer.

1009
01:17:05,253 --> 01:17:07,120
A peer?

1010
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:10,757
No, Mr. Lord. I only agreed to meet
with you because I was curious.

1011
01:17:10,759 --> 01:17:14,162
No one gets that lucky.
How did you do it?

1012
01:17:16,598 --> 01:17:20,500
On my journey
to self-fulfillment...

1013
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:22,869
I lucked into a secret.

1014
01:17:22,871 --> 01:17:25,273
The secret of the wish.

1015
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:27,307
So I wished for it.

1016
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:30,746
Or someone
wished for it for me.

1017
01:17:32,514 --> 01:17:34,681
Tell me what you wish for,
Your Highness,

1018
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:37,386
and I will show you
how it works.

1019
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:41,554
I wish for things
one cannot attain.

1020
01:17:41,556 --> 01:17:42,958
Like what?

1021
01:17:45,027 --> 01:17:47,394
All of my land to be returned.

1022
01:17:47,396 --> 01:17:49,262
My ancestral realm.

1023
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:51,631
The Bialyian Dynasty.

1024
01:17:51,633 --> 01:17:54,668
And for all the heathens
who dare trod upon it

1025
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:59,939
to be kept out forever,
so that its glory may be renewed.

1026
01:17:59,941 --> 01:18:01,975
You wish for that?

1027
01:18:01,977 --> 01:18:04,911
I wish for that deeply.

1028
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:12,452
Your wish is granted.

1029
01:18:12,454 --> 01:18:15,789
And in return,
I will take your oil.

1030
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:24,064
You truly delight me.

1031
01:18:24,066 --> 01:18:26,366
You know so little.

1032
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:29,836
I sold my oil to the Saudis.

1033
01:18:29,838 --> 01:18:31,204
You are a silly man.

1034
01:18:39,648 --> 01:18:41,815
Then I will take
your security team

1035
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:43,883
and leave you here
with nothing to defend yourself

1036
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:47,487
against the wrath you most
certainly will face.

1037
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:30,830
Stop! Stop the car!

1038
01:19:30,832 --> 01:19:32,098
What are you doing?

1039
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,434
Stop what you're doing now!
I'm telling you.

1040
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:36,471
I command you to stop!

1041
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:38,404
Stop!

1042
01:19:38,406 --> 01:19:40,776
Stop! Stop!

1043
01:19:42,844 --> 01:19:45,612
This
unbelievable and unexplainable wall

1044
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:47,380
appears to somehow be the work

1045
01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:49,315
of Emir Said Bin Abydos.

1046
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:52,051
The government is reporting
old rulings have emerged

1047
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:54,523
acknowledging his claim
to the land.

1048
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:06,966
You okay?

1049
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:09,536
I'm fine.

1050
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:13,408
You keep saying that, but...

1051
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:16,609
That was him!

1052
01:20:16,611 --> 01:20:18,747
That was Max Lord.

1053
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:48,877
Get rid of them, please.

1054
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:25,812
I got this.

1055
01:21:25,814 --> 01:21:26,781
What?

1056
01:21:27,983 --> 01:21:29,184
Diana!

1057
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:44,966
The brakes still work.

1058
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:01,267
Max Lord,

1059
01:24:01,269 --> 01:24:04,704
you're putting yourself and
everyone else in grave danger.

1060
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:06,572
I need you
to give me the stone.

1061
01:24:06,574 --> 01:24:08,708
What happened to it?

1062
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,812
You're looking at it.

1063
01:24:16,985 --> 01:24:18,119
Whoa!

1064
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:10,738
Steve!

1065
01:25:11,206 --> 01:25:12,173
Diana!

1066
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,767
So who's the next
closest person with oil?

1067
01:26:34,489 --> 01:26:37,823
Diana. Diana.

1068
01:26:37,825 --> 01:26:42,862
My God.
What's going on with you?

1069
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:45,665
[news anchor A truly bizarre phenomenon
that is being called the Divine Wall.

1070
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:47,166
What is happening?

1071
01:26:47,168 --> 01:26:48,901
It's an unexplainable event

1072
01:26:48,903 --> 01:26:50,703
that now sees
Egypt's poorest communities

1073
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:53,206
entirely cut off from their
only supply of fresh water.

1074
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:55,975
An already
tense situation now escalating

1075
01:26:55,977 --> 01:27:00,246
as the Soviet Union announces they
will recognize the Emir's claim.

1076
01:27:00,248 --> 01:27:02,014
- Oh, no.
- The United States,

1077
01:27:02,016 --> 01:27:04,383
a longtime ally of Egypt,
has declared

1078
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:07,153
their intention to side
with the government.

1079
01:27:07,155 --> 01:27:09,488
Bedlam on the home front
now as well

1080
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:12,158
as the shocking news
that American businessman

1081
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:15,027
Max Lord has somehow
come into possession

1082
01:27:15,029 --> 01:27:17,430
of over half
of the world's oil reserves.

1083
01:27:17,432 --> 01:27:20,633
The instability in the
oil community has resulted

1084
01:27:20,635 --> 01:27:22,568
in a nationwide run on gas,

1085
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:24,570
and experts are girding themselves...

1086
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:25,705
Hello?

1087
01:27:25,707 --> 01:27:27,106
Barbara, it's Diana.

1088
01:27:27,108 --> 01:27:30,476
- Did you...
- Yeah. Uh, well, sort of.

1089
01:27:30,478 --> 01:27:33,112
I haven't figured out
exactly what the stone is,

1090
01:27:33,114 --> 01:27:36,182
but I've found
historical images of it.

1091
01:27:36,184 --> 01:27:37,016
From where?

1092
01:27:37,018 --> 01:27:38,618
That's the weird thing.

1093
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:40,419
From everywhere.

1094
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:43,956
It first appeared in the Indus
Valley almost 4,000 years ago.

1095
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:46,692
It popped up again
in Carthage in 146 BC.

1096
01:27:46,694 --> 01:27:48,694
Kush, 4 AD.

1097
01:27:48,696 --> 01:27:50,563
Romulus, the last
Emperor of Rome,

1098
01:27:50,565 --> 01:27:53,733
he had it on him when
he was assassinated in 476.

1099
01:27:53,735 --> 01:27:57,803
The last record is in some
previously unknown dead city

1100
01:27:57,805 --> 01:27:59,205
near Dzibilchaltun.

1101
01:27:59,207 --> 01:28:01,173
- The Mayans.
- Yeah.

1102
01:28:01,175 --> 01:28:03,309
Anyway, it just led me
to a bunch of dead ends,

1103
01:28:03,311 --> 01:28:07,213
and my last lead
is not that promising.

1104
01:28:07,215 --> 01:28:08,447
What's that?

1105
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:10,049
A flier I found.

1106
01:28:10,051 --> 01:28:12,018
Grabbed it at the embassy.

1107
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:14,887
Some guy advertising
to be a Mayan shaman.

1108
01:28:14,889 --> 01:28:18,457
But he literally teaches a course
in a squat next to Galaxy Records.

1109
01:28:18,459 --> 01:28:21,294
- And he knows about the stone?
- So he says.

1110
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:23,496
I'm gonna go there
in the morning.

1111
01:28:23,498 --> 01:28:27,302
Okay, we'll meet you there.
And thank you.

1112
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:32,006
What is it?

1113
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:35,207
The stone has
traveled the world

1114
01:28:35,209 --> 01:28:37,076
to seemingly random
and different places,

1115
01:28:37,078 --> 01:28:39,478
- but they all have one thing in common.
- What?

1116
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,682
Their civilizations collapsed
catastrophically.

1117
01:28:42,684 --> 01:28:45,051
Without a trace as to why.

1118
01:28:45,053 --> 01:28:46,954
You don't think
the stone could have...

1119
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:48,988
Do you?

1120
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:51,225
I don't know
what to think, Steve.

1121
01:28:52,026 --> 01:28:55,096
I can only hope I'm wrong.

1122
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:25,059
Babajide?

1123
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:32,233
- That was fast.
- Morning.

1124
01:29:34,335 --> 01:29:35,903
Hello.

1125
01:29:37,338 --> 01:29:39,505
One second.

1126
01:29:41,342 --> 01:29:43,409
So you're a Mayan?

1127
01:29:43,411 --> 01:29:45,978
What? I'm a citizen
of the world.

1128
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:47,413
It says your name is Frank.

1129
01:29:47,415 --> 01:29:50,783
Yeah. Most of what I know
is a past-life thing.

1130
01:29:50,785 --> 01:29:52,151
So that's a no.

1131
01:29:52,153 --> 01:29:54,587
But to answer
your question, yes.

1132
01:29:54,589 --> 01:29:57,790
My great-great-grandfather

1133
01:29:57,792 --> 01:29:59,525
left me this.

1134
01:29:59,527 --> 01:30:02,695
I don't know everything about
it, but I have been warned

1135
01:30:02,697 --> 01:30:04,230
I'm better off that way.

1136
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:07,867
What I do know is,
it destroyed our people

1137
01:30:07,869 --> 01:30:09,301
in a matter of months.

1138
01:30:09,303 --> 01:30:12,004
The few survivors,
they buried the stone,

1139
01:30:12,006 --> 01:30:15,174
never to be exhumed
under any circumstances.

1140
01:30:15,176 --> 01:30:18,012
- Can I see that?
- Be my guest.

1141
01:30:32,126 --> 01:30:33,628
What?

1142
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:35,430
What is it?

1143
01:30:39,233 --> 01:30:41,100
[DianDechalafrea Ero.

1144
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:42,435
What's that?

1145
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:44,770
A very bad God.

1146
01:30:44,772 --> 01:30:47,339
The God of Lies,
Dolos, Mendacius,

1147
01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:49,608
Duke of Deception.
He's been called by many names.

1148
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:52,044
But if he's the one
who empowered that stone,

1149
01:30:52,046 --> 01:30:53,512
there has to be a trick.

1150
01:30:53,514 --> 01:30:55,514
What do lies have to do
with granting wishes?

1151
01:30:55,516 --> 01:30:58,085
It seems more like
a Dreamstone to me.

1152
01:30:58,953 --> 01:31:01,754
Wishes with a trick.

1153
01:31:01,756 --> 01:31:04,156
"The Monkey's Paw."

1154
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:05,958
Beware what you wish for.

1155
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:09,397
It grants your wish,
but takes your most valued possession.

1156
01:31:10,698 --> 01:31:12,565
Diana, your powers.

1157
01:31:12,567 --> 01:31:14,200
No, that doesn't
make any sense.

1158
01:31:14,202 --> 01:31:16,135
What's more precious
than what you wish for?

1159
01:31:16,137 --> 01:31:17,369
How do we stop this?

1160
01:31:17,371 --> 01:31:18,938
The legend said

1161
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:21,073
it can only be stopped
by destroying the stone itself

1162
01:31:21,075 --> 01:31:23,108
or give back what was given.
My people couldn't do the first thing

1163
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:24,679
and refused to do the second.

1164
01:31:25,713 --> 01:31:27,513
Now the culture's destroyed.

1165
01:31:27,515 --> 01:31:29,582
Wiped from the face
of the Earth.

1166
01:31:29,584 --> 01:31:32,618
- No one renounced their wish?
- But the stone is already destroyed.

1167
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:34,422
What? When?

1168
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:38,924
"You're looking at it."

1169
01:31:38,926 --> 01:31:42,828
"You're looking at it." That's
what Max Lord said to me.

1170
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:44,697
Maybe it's him.

1171
01:31:44,699 --> 01:31:46,532
He's become it somehow.

1172
01:31:46,534 --> 01:31:48,467
But how would
that happen?

1173
01:31:48,469 --> 01:31:51,105
I mean, if he wished for...

1174
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:02,381
No, that's crazy. No.

1175
01:32:02,383 --> 01:32:04,750
If we destroy it,

1176
01:32:04,752 --> 01:32:06,754
if we destroy him...

1177
01:32:07,822 --> 01:32:09,188
all the wishes go back.

1178
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:10,689
What are you
talking about? No.

1179
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:12,591
I'm not gonna be
a part of that. No.

1180
01:32:12,593 --> 01:32:14,560
Or if everyone
renounces their wish.

1181
01:32:14,562 --> 01:32:17,997
No, there has to be
a better way.

1182
01:32:17,999 --> 01:32:19,534
No.

1183
01:32:23,037 --> 01:32:24,537
She's right.

1184
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:26,805
We don't know enough.
We just don't know enough.

1185
01:32:26,807 --> 01:32:29,708
But what we do know is that we need
to stop him before he grants any more.

1186
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:33,679
Stopping him might
not be enough, Diana.

1187
01:32:33,681 --> 01:32:35,283
Wishes have been made.

1188
01:32:37,451 --> 01:32:38,753
Barbara?

1189
01:32:40,121 --> 01:32:41,656
Barbara?

1190
01:32:49,764 --> 01:32:52,398
Like I want any of
these people in the club anyway.

1191
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:53,966
Can we tell them
they're not invited?

1192
01:32:53,968 --> 01:32:55,367
No, sir.

1193
01:32:55,369 --> 01:32:57,169
- The FCC said we couldn't...
- Oh, the FCC.

1194
01:32:57,171 --> 01:33:01,140
The BBB, the FBD.

1195
01:33:01,142 --> 01:33:03,876
It's a conspiracy
against my success.

1196
01:33:03,878 --> 01:33:06,211
They're jealous. That's why.
Who's next?

1197
01:33:06,213 --> 01:33:08,914
- Who's next?
- Well, everyone you asked for,

1198
01:33:08,916 --> 01:33:10,649
Lai Zhong, Mr. Khalaji,

1199
01:33:10,651 --> 01:33:13,719
- that televangelist who stole your slot.
- Mmm.

1200
01:33:13,721 --> 01:33:15,521
And you have Alistair
for the night.

1201
01:33:15,523 --> 01:33:18,824
Alistair? Again?
How many weekends do I have?

1202
01:33:18,826 --> 01:33:19,892
What? What? When?

1203
01:33:19,894 --> 01:33:21,429
Tonight?

1204
01:33:26,133 --> 01:33:27,366
He's here already.

1205
01:33:27,368 --> 01:33:29,270
His mom is with her boyfriend.

1206
01:33:34,775 --> 01:33:37,009
Send in Mr. Zhong, please.

1207
01:33:37,011 --> 01:33:40,079
And buy Alistair a pony.

1208
01:33:40,081 --> 01:33:42,516
No! A race car.
Get him a race car.

1209
01:33:44,919 --> 01:33:47,019
Let's get to it, Lai.

1210
01:33:47,021 --> 01:33:48,723
Tell me...

1211
01:33:49,357 --> 01:33:50,925
what do you want?

1212
01:33:52,093 --> 01:33:55,160
What do you wish for?

1213
01:33:55,162 --> 01:33:57,429
- Me? Truly?
- Mmm-hmm.

1214
01:33:57,431 --> 01:33:59,365
Mmm-hmm.

1215
01:33:59,367 --> 01:34:02,134
The Soviets have sided
with Iran.

1216
01:34:02,136 --> 01:34:05,504
Iraq is preparing to defend
ourselves, as unrest spreads.

1217
01:34:05,506 --> 01:34:08,774
And you need? What do you...

1218
01:34:08,776 --> 01:34:10,576
What do you wish for?

1219
01:34:10,578 --> 01:34:12,878
Consider the sex tape gone.

1220
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:15,114
And God darn it,
if I have to keep doing this

1221
01:34:15,116 --> 01:34:18,150
one by one, by one, by one...

1222
01:34:18,152 --> 01:34:19,785
- How's your health?
- Well...

1223
01:34:19,787 --> 01:34:20,886
Forget that.

1224
01:34:20,888 --> 01:34:23,122
But I will take
your entire congregation

1225
01:34:23,124 --> 01:34:24,690
and your time slot.

1226
01:34:24,692 --> 01:34:25,691
Let me ask you,

1227
01:34:25,693 --> 01:34:27,960
when they pray,
is there any way

1228
01:34:27,962 --> 01:34:31,163
I could get all of them to...

1229
01:34:31,165 --> 01:34:32,464
join hands with me?

1230
01:34:32,466 --> 01:34:34,299
And simply say, "I wish"

1231
01:34:34,301 --> 01:34:36,368
rather than, "I pray"?

1232
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:37,903
Would that even work?

1233
01:34:37,905 --> 01:34:38,904
I don't...

1234
01:34:38,906 --> 01:34:40,339
I need to find a way

1235
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:43,208
to touch a lot of people
at the same time.

1236
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:46,145
Sir. The police are here.

1237
01:34:46,147 --> 01:34:48,514
They're challenging the
jurisdiction of your security team.

1238
01:34:48,516 --> 01:34:50,649
Oh, God!

1239
01:34:50,651 --> 01:34:53,919
This isn't working.
Bring in someone new.

1240
01:34:53,921 --> 01:34:55,120
And my son.

1241
01:34:55,122 --> 01:34:57,189
You, beat it.

1242
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:08,434
Alistair!

1243
01:35:10,438 --> 01:35:12,938
I've missed you, buddy.

1244
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:14,875
Come. Sit down with Daddy.
I'm sorry.

1245
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:21,714
But, your dad is on the absolute
precipice of everything.

1246
01:35:21,716 --> 01:35:24,149
Remember when I told you
that I would be number one?

1247
01:35:24,151 --> 01:35:26,118
Do you remember? Your dad?

1248
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:28,353
Well, I'm inches away. Huh?

1249
01:35:28,355 --> 01:35:30,322
I know it's hard. I know.

1250
01:35:30,324 --> 01:35:31,924
But listen,

1251
01:35:31,926 --> 01:35:34,326
I also know what you wish for,
and I wish for it, too.

1252
01:35:34,328 --> 01:35:36,495
Do you hear that?
I wish for it, too.

1253
01:35:36,497 --> 01:35:37,896
I just wish
I could be with you...

1254
01:35:37,898 --> 01:35:39,567
No!

1255
01:35:40,968 --> 01:35:43,836
You don't use your
one wish like that, Alistair.

1256
01:35:43,838 --> 01:35:46,739
You don't wish for something
that you already have.

1257
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:49,541
You wish for greatness,
for success.

1258
01:35:49,543 --> 01:35:51,844
That's why
I'm doing all of this.

1259
01:35:51,846 --> 01:35:56,717
Don't you see that my greatness
is your greatness? Huh?

1260
01:36:00,287 --> 01:36:02,221
Then I wish for your greatness.

1261
01:36:02,223 --> 01:36:04,391
No. No!

1262
01:36:17,071 --> 01:36:18,706
Thank you.

1263
01:36:20,007 --> 01:36:22,174
I love you so much.

1264
01:36:22,176 --> 01:36:24,209
And I promise you, one day,

1265
01:36:24,211 --> 01:36:26,612
everything is going
to make sense.

1266
01:36:26,614 --> 01:36:29,650
And one day, you'll thank me.

1267
01:36:31,018 --> 01:36:33,652
But right now, I, uh...

1268
01:36:33,654 --> 01:36:37,156
Right now, I need you to stay here
with Emerson, okay? I'll be back.

1269
01:36:37,158 --> 01:36:39,493
You stay here.

1270
01:36:50,271 --> 01:36:51,904
You. You.

1271
01:36:51,906 --> 01:36:53,472
Yes, sir?

1272
01:36:53,474 --> 01:36:55,874
Don't you wish I had an audience
with the President today?

1273
01:36:55,876 --> 01:36:57,576
Of course I do.

1274
01:36:57,578 --> 01:36:59,611
And can I tell you how happy I am
that you value my opinion, sir.

1275
01:36:59,613 --> 01:37:02,014
Wait a minute.
Have I asked for your wish before?

1276
01:37:02,016 --> 01:37:04,016
Yesterday. A Porsche.

1277
01:37:04,018 --> 01:37:05,686
What is it with you aides
and Porsches?

1278
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:07,386
You!

1279
01:37:07,388 --> 01:37:08,887
Hi.

1280
01:37:08,889 --> 01:37:11,025
This way.

1281
01:37:15,896 --> 01:37:16,962
How's traffic?

1282
01:37:16,964 --> 01:37:18,597
Huh? Terrible.

1283
01:37:18,599 --> 01:37:20,265
Don't you wish it wasn't?

1284
01:37:20,267 --> 01:37:23,268
And that everywhere you went
parted like the great Red Sea?

1285
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:27,741
Of course I wish that.
Sadly, ain't gonna happen.

1286
01:37:35,482 --> 01:37:37,049
Hey, you! Stop!

1287
01:37:37,051 --> 01:37:39,384
Come on in. It's not safe.

1288
01:37:39,386 --> 01:37:41,286
There's a riot
at the Saudi Embassy

1289
01:37:41,288 --> 01:37:44,122
and there are Porsches
racing up and down the street.

1290
01:37:44,124 --> 01:37:45,290
Come on. It's mad.

1291
01:37:45,292 --> 01:37:48,293
But my cows.

1292
01:37:48,295 --> 01:37:52,030
I told a man I wanted a farm.

1293
01:37:52,032 --> 01:37:54,501
I didn't mean here.

1294
01:37:58,706 --> 01:38:01,141
I'll be right back.

1295
01:38:58,966 --> 01:39:01,867
Diana, I know it's been hard.

1296
01:39:01,869 --> 01:39:04,269
You don't know. You don't.

1297
01:39:04,271 --> 01:39:06,305
But we...

1298
01:39:06,307 --> 01:39:07,806
It can't go on like this.

1299
01:39:07,808 --> 01:39:09,942
- I can't talk about this.
- We have to talk about it.

1300
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:11,779
Steve, I can't talk about this!

1301
01:39:17,384 --> 01:39:19,985
I give everything I have,
every day.

1302
01:39:19,987 --> 01:39:21,787
And I'm happy to.

1303
01:39:21,789 --> 01:39:25,257
But this one thing...

1304
01:39:25,259 --> 01:39:30,062
You're all that I've wanted
for so long.

1305
01:39:30,064 --> 01:39:33,834
You're the only joy I've had
or even asked for.

1306
01:39:34,535 --> 01:39:36,270
I am so sorry...

1307
01:39:38,372 --> 01:39:41,039
but that's crazy.

1308
01:39:41,041 --> 01:39:45,210
There's a world
out there full of

1309
01:39:45,212 --> 01:39:46,611
so many better guys, for one.

1310
01:39:46,613 --> 01:39:48,780
I mean, how about this guy?
How about him?

1311
01:39:48,782 --> 01:39:51,416
I don't want him. I want you.

1312
01:39:51,418 --> 01:39:55,053
Why, for once, can't I just
have this one thing, Steve?

1313
01:39:55,055 --> 01:39:56,757
This one thing.

1314
01:39:59,526 --> 01:40:01,996
I'm not sure we have a choice.

1315
01:40:04,131 --> 01:40:06,665
Well, I do have a choice.

1316
01:40:06,667 --> 01:40:08,166
And I can't give you up.
I can't.

1317
01:40:08,168 --> 01:40:10,669
So I won't.
So we need to stop him

1318
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:12,904
so we can figure that out.

1319
01:40:12,906 --> 01:40:14,274
There has to be another way.

1320
01:40:15,876 --> 01:40:17,277
Has to.

1321
01:40:30,357 --> 01:40:31,625
Wow.

1322
01:40:32,359 --> 01:40:35,596
This is incredible.

1323
01:40:40,401 --> 01:40:41,668
What's that?

1324
01:40:43,003 --> 01:40:44,669
From my culture.

1325
01:40:44,671 --> 01:40:49,474
The armor of an ancient Amazon warrior.
One of our greatest.

1326
01:40:49,476 --> 01:40:52,112
It's huge. This whole thing?

1327
01:40:54,248 --> 01:40:55,580
What is it made out of?

1328
01:40:55,582 --> 01:40:57,618
Here. Let me show you.

1329
01:40:58,318 --> 01:41:00,152
Give me your hand.

1330
01:41:00,154 --> 01:41:01,920
What are you talking about?
I haven't lied.

1331
01:41:01,922 --> 01:41:04,589
The Lasso does more than
just make you tell the truth.

1332
01:41:04,591 --> 01:41:06,827
It can make you see it, too.

1333
01:41:12,566 --> 01:41:14,399
Her name was Asteria.

1334
01:41:14,401 --> 01:41:16,334
She was our greatest warrior.

1335
01:41:16,336 --> 01:41:20,672
When mankind enslaved the
Amazons, my mother freed us.

1336
01:41:20,674 --> 01:41:23,942
But someone had to stay behind
to hold back the tide of men

1337
01:41:23,944 --> 01:41:27,145
so the others
could escape to Themyscira.

1338
01:41:27,147 --> 01:41:29,347
My people gave up
all of their armor

1339
01:41:29,349 --> 01:41:34,519
to make her one suit strong
enough to take on the whole world.

1340
01:41:34,521 --> 01:41:40,027
And Asteria sacrificed herself
for a better day for others.

1341
01:41:43,797 --> 01:41:45,299
That's...

1342
01:41:47,167 --> 01:41:48,333
That's incredible.

1343
01:41:48,335 --> 01:41:51,536
When I came here,
I searched for her.

1344
01:41:51,538 --> 01:41:54,840
But all I could find
was her armor.

1345
01:41:54,842 --> 01:41:56,677
What is this?

1346
01:41:57,711 --> 01:41:59,578
Where is he going?

1347
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:01,081
Oh, no.

1348
01:42:20,767 --> 01:42:22,501
Diana, Diana!
What are you doing?

1349
01:42:22,503 --> 01:42:24,336
- Where are you going?
- Steve, I'm going. You need to stay.

1350
01:42:24,338 --> 01:42:26,404
No. No. Listen to me.

1351
01:42:26,406 --> 01:42:27,739
You're getting weaker, Diana.

1352
01:42:27,741 --> 01:42:29,007
- What if you fall?
- I won't.

1353
01:42:29,009 --> 01:42:32,010
You might. We don't know that.

1354
01:42:32,012 --> 01:42:34,414
There has to be another way in.

1355
01:42:46,927 --> 01:42:49,062
Everything okay, Mr. President?

1356
01:42:49,396 --> 01:42:50,464
Yes.

1357
01:42:51,431 --> 01:42:53,665
Something very strange. I...

1358
01:42:53,667 --> 01:42:57,371
I thought I was somewhere else entirely.
Suddenly...

1359
01:42:58,705 --> 01:43:01,708
Anyway. Hectic times.

1360
01:43:02,743 --> 01:43:05,145
Give us a minute.

1361
01:43:10,817 --> 01:43:11,985
Excuse me.

1362
01:43:15,422 --> 01:43:17,022
- Carl.
- Diana.

1363
01:43:17,024 --> 01:43:18,924
- Hi.
- What a pleasure.

1364
01:43:18,926 --> 01:43:21,059
Good to see you.
How have you been?

1365
01:43:21,061 --> 01:43:22,394
- Good.
- This is Steve.

1366
01:43:22,396 --> 01:43:24,296
Steve, this is Carl.
My colleague.

1367
01:43:24,298 --> 01:43:26,665
- Hi.
- Hi.

1368
01:43:26,667 --> 01:43:27,966
Shall we, uh...

1369
01:43:27,968 --> 01:43:30,635
Yeah, we shall.

1370
01:43:30,637 --> 01:43:32,304
I'm sorry, Mr. Lord.

1371
01:43:32,306 --> 01:43:34,639
In fact, I don't even know
what we're supposed to discuss.

1372
01:43:34,641 --> 01:43:35,907
Exactly that, Mr. President.

1373
01:43:35,909 --> 01:43:39,947
These hectic days,
hectic times.

1374
01:43:41,081 --> 01:43:42,380
And you.

1375
01:43:42,382 --> 01:43:43,748
These aren't
exactly my favorite

1376
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:45,550
of the busts on display here,

1377
01:43:45,552 --> 01:43:49,020
but it's a little picture of my top
ten, maybe top five at a push.

1378
01:43:49,022 --> 01:43:51,323
Oh, here's something up ahead
that will interest you.

1379
01:43:51,325 --> 01:43:56,161
These are floor tiles originally
laid by none other than Jan Lincoln,

1380
01:43:56,163 --> 01:43:58,763
a little-known descendent
of Abraham.

1381
01:43:58,765 --> 01:44:01,499
You're having some troubles?

1382
01:44:01,501 --> 01:44:02,901
Everywhere suddenly.

1383
01:44:02,903 --> 01:44:04,836
Cuba, Egypt,

1384
01:44:04,838 --> 01:44:06,440
even here.

1385
01:44:07,207 --> 01:44:08,740
But Russia...

1386
01:44:08,742 --> 01:44:10,877
- very troublesome.
- Mmm.

1387
01:44:12,613 --> 01:44:14,112
I appreciate your concern,

1388
01:44:14,114 --> 01:44:16,448
but all the money in the world
won't help us now.

1389
01:44:16,450 --> 01:44:18,717
It's not money I'm offering.

1390
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:20,354
You.

1391
01:44:21,154 --> 01:44:23,255
You are a man of faith,

1392
01:44:23,257 --> 01:44:26,260
and I have been
very blessed lately.

1393
01:44:29,463 --> 01:44:32,332
I want to share
my blessing with you.

1394
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:36,036
The power of positive thinking.

1395
01:44:39,673 --> 01:44:41,973
Now...

1396
01:44:41,975 --> 01:44:45,477
tell me, Mr. President,
what do you need?

1397
01:44:45,479 --> 01:44:48,980
And you're not speaking to me
here, but to the universe.

1398
01:44:48,982 --> 01:44:51,418
What do you wish for?

1399
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:56,421
What is there to wish for but more?

1400
01:44:56,423 --> 01:44:58,657
More nuclear weapons.
More than they have.

1401
01:44:58,659 --> 01:45:00,492
Closer to 'em.

1402
01:45:00,494 --> 01:45:02,294
If I just had that in place,

1403
01:45:02,296 --> 01:45:04,496
then they would
have to listen to us.

1404
01:45:04,498 --> 01:45:07,799
A nice thought.
And I grant you...

1405
01:45:10,604 --> 01:45:12,003
Oh... Oh, my...

1406
01:45:16,910 --> 01:45:20,345
And you know what I'd like?

1407
01:45:20,347 --> 01:45:24,616
I would want all of your power,
influence, authority.

1408
01:45:24,618 --> 01:45:25,984
All the respect you command

1409
01:45:25,986 --> 01:45:30,324
and the command
everyone must respect.

1410
01:45:35,962 --> 01:45:39,064
I mean, what else is there?

1411
01:45:39,066 --> 01:45:41,966
Now, tell your people
I would appreciate

1412
01:45:41,968 --> 01:45:45,804
absolutely no interference
whatsoever.

1413
01:45:45,806 --> 01:45:48,173
No taxes, no rule of law,
no limits.

1414
01:45:48,175 --> 01:45:52,913
Treat me like a foreign nation
with absolute autonomy.

1415
01:45:53,980 --> 01:45:55,513
Very good, sir.

1416
01:45:55,515 --> 01:45:56,583
Right away.

1417
01:46:04,291 --> 01:46:05,390
What's this?

1418
01:46:05,392 --> 01:46:06,858
Global Broadcast Satellite.

1419
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:08,426
Top-secret program
that enables us

1420
01:46:08,428 --> 01:46:10,562
to override any broadcast
system in the world

1421
01:46:10,564 --> 01:46:14,532
in case we need direct contact
with the people of an enemy state.

1422
01:46:14,534 --> 01:46:15,800
So what does that mean?

1423
01:46:15,802 --> 01:46:18,169
You're taking over
everyone's TVs?

1424
01:46:18,171 --> 01:46:19,337
How?

1425
01:46:19,339 --> 01:46:20,905
It uses
particle beam technology,

1426
01:46:20,907 --> 01:46:22,841
just like
the Star Wars program.

1427
01:46:22,843 --> 01:46:26,211
Apparently, it bathes the landscape
in a signal of particles that goes in

1428
01:46:26,213 --> 01:46:29,114
and fiddles with
any technology it touches.

1429
01:46:29,116 --> 01:46:31,950
New or old.
Broadcast whatever you want.

1430
01:46:31,952 --> 01:46:33,618
Very impressive.

1431
01:46:33,620 --> 01:46:38,189
You said "touches"?

1432
01:46:38,191 --> 01:46:41,328
As in the particles
you are sending...

1433
01:46:43,864 --> 01:46:48,466
are touching everything?

1434
01:46:48,468 --> 01:46:50,201
It's a figure of speech,

1435
01:46:50,203 --> 01:46:51,770
but yes.

1436
01:46:51,772 --> 01:46:53,238
- That's how it was explained to me.
- I need immediate access

1437
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:55,907
to this satellite.
And a chopper

1438
01:46:55,909 --> 01:46:57,242
to get me there.

1439
01:46:57,244 --> 01:46:58,545
Yes, sir. Right away.

1440
01:47:09,089 --> 01:47:11,222
Well, aren't you resourceful?

1441
01:47:11,224 --> 01:47:14,592
Come with me before you do
any more damage, Max.

1442
01:47:14,594 --> 01:47:16,161
No. I don't think so.

1443
01:47:16,163 --> 01:47:17,996
Remove this woman, please...

1444
01:47:17,998 --> 01:47:19,966
permanently.

1445
01:47:28,775 --> 01:47:30,510
- Are you okay?
- I don't know.

1446
01:47:34,114 --> 01:47:35,380
No, Steve. You can't use that.

1447
01:47:35,382 --> 01:47:38,016
It's not their fault.

1448
01:48:25,665 --> 01:48:27,067
That's neat.

1449
01:49:00,367 --> 01:49:01,835
Barbara.

1450
01:49:04,971 --> 01:49:06,806
I can't let you do this, Diana.

1451
01:49:37,571 --> 01:49:40,371
Barbara. What...

1452
01:49:40,373 --> 01:49:43,508
- How...
- I can't let you stop Max.

1453
01:49:43,510 --> 01:49:46,246
You're not the only one
with something to lose.

1454
01:49:49,583 --> 01:49:52,152
Turns out wishing
to be like you...

1455
01:49:53,186 --> 01:49:55,388
came with some surprises.

1456
01:49:58,825 --> 01:50:00,191
Hands up.

1457
01:50:00,193 --> 01:50:01,359
- Hands up.
- Hands up, hands up.

1458
01:50:01,361 --> 01:50:02,594
Hands up!

1459
01:50:02,596 --> 01:50:04,531
- Hands up!
- Now! Now, now!

1460
01:50:18,078 --> 01:50:19,512
Open fire!

1461
01:50:34,227 --> 01:50:37,495
Oh, how sweet,
defending your love. Huh?

1462
01:50:37,497 --> 01:50:40,498
What do you wish for?
Do you wanna be a real boy?

1463
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:41,933
No.

1464
01:50:41,935 --> 01:50:44,371
Just not to be handcuffed to
you, but now I am.

1465
01:50:51,811 --> 01:50:53,811
I just learned that.

1466
01:51:05,892 --> 01:51:07,327
Barbara, stop!

1467
01:51:09,729 --> 01:51:10,962
Ahh!

1468
01:51:18,538 --> 01:51:19,771
Listen.

1469
01:51:19,773 --> 01:51:20,571
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

1470
01:51:20,573 --> 01:51:21,973
I'm not what you think.

1471
01:51:21,975 --> 01:51:23,408
You can't possibly
understand or handle...

1472
01:51:23,410 --> 01:51:25,677
Oh, I can't
possibly understand?

1473
01:51:29,015 --> 01:51:30,248
Oh...

1474
01:51:30,250 --> 01:51:32,016
Dumb little old me.

1475
01:51:32,018 --> 01:51:33,484
Dumb little, poor little

1476
01:51:33,486 --> 01:51:35,553
nothing, nobody me.

1477
01:51:35,555 --> 01:51:37,288
I couldn't possibly handle it.

1478
01:51:37,290 --> 01:51:39,859
No, Barbara.
That's not what I'm saying.

1479
01:51:45,732 --> 01:51:48,633
Well,
I'm handling it beautifully.

1480
01:51:48,635 --> 01:51:50,537
And I'm not giving it back!

1481
01:52:14,761 --> 01:52:15,695
Go.

1482
01:52:16,696 --> 01:52:17,731
Run!

1483
01:52:18,865 --> 01:52:20,266
Everyone, stand down.

1484
01:52:20,834 --> 01:52:23,002
Nobody hurts her.

1485
01:52:24,537 --> 01:52:27,004
They couldn't if they tried.

1486
01:52:31,344 --> 01:52:33,444
You've always
had everything,

1487
01:52:33,446 --> 01:52:36,380
while people like me
have had nothing.

1488
01:52:36,382 --> 01:52:40,887
Well, now it's my turn.
And you are not taking it from me. Ever!

1489
01:52:42,422 --> 01:52:44,288
But what is it costing you?

1490
01:52:44,290 --> 01:52:45,857
What is it costing me?

1491
01:52:45,859 --> 01:52:49,362
If it's the monkey's paw,
it takes as much as it gives.

1492
01:52:51,264 --> 01:52:54,265
Yes, you're strong...

1493
01:52:54,267 --> 01:52:57,368
but what did you lose, Barbara?

1494
01:52:57,370 --> 01:53:01,005
Where's your warmth, your joy,

1495
01:53:01,007 --> 01:53:02,640
your humanity?

1496
01:53:02,642 --> 01:53:06,444
You're attacking innocent men,
Barbara. Look at yourself.

1497
01:53:06,446 --> 01:53:08,479
Forget about me.

1498
01:53:08,481 --> 01:53:10,817
What is it costing you?

1499
01:53:15,855 --> 01:53:18,356
Yeah, yeah.

1500
01:53:18,358 --> 01:53:20,426
That's right.

1501
01:53:21,060 --> 01:53:23,096
Get used to it.

1502
01:53:25,665 --> 01:53:28,368
If you go after Max Lord...

1503
01:53:29,035 --> 01:53:31,369
or hurt him in any way,

1504
01:53:31,371 --> 01:53:33,004
I will destroy you.

1505
01:53:33,006 --> 01:53:34,138
Barbara!

1506
01:53:51,357 --> 01:53:53,393
Are you all right?

1507
01:54:14,547 --> 01:54:16,816
Room for one more?

1508
01:54:25,191 --> 01:54:26,657
Sir, you need to wait.

1509
01:54:26,659 --> 01:54:27,959
The President has
a meeting right now.

1510
01:54:27,961 --> 01:54:29,060
We need
to see the President.

1511
01:54:29,062 --> 01:54:30,728
He needs to be told.

1512
01:54:30,730 --> 01:54:32,463
- This is a matter of life and death.
- What is going on?

1513
01:54:32,465 --> 01:54:35,633
The Soviets' early detection
system picked up our new nukes.

1514
01:54:35,635 --> 01:54:37,568
What new nukes?

1515
01:54:37,570 --> 01:54:40,104
A hundred warheads just went
online, ready to launch.

1516
01:54:40,106 --> 01:54:42,406
They're taking this
as an act of war.

1517
01:54:42,408 --> 01:54:44,075
Prepping to return fire.

1518
01:54:44,077 --> 01:54:45,676
Return? What?

1519
01:54:45,678 --> 01:54:47,712
We haven't done anything.

1520
01:54:47,714 --> 01:54:49,380
That's not how it looks.

1521
01:54:49,382 --> 01:54:51,851
And we'd fire for less.

1522
01:54:54,654 --> 01:54:56,420
Are you kidding me?

1523
01:54:56,422 --> 01:54:58,456
You blew through that light right there!
You didn't even see!

1524
01:54:58,458 --> 01:54:59,857
How do you not see that?

1525
01:54:59,859 --> 01:55:01,826
Riots across
the world erupting

1526
01:55:01,828 --> 01:55:05,463
as America and the Soviet Union
end communication,

1527
01:55:05,465 --> 01:55:07,565
declaring war!

1528
01:55:07,567 --> 01:55:09,133
No one knows
any more than that.

1529
01:55:09,135 --> 01:55:11,369
But as you can imagine
with what's at stake,

1530
01:55:11,371 --> 01:55:13,638
there has been
madness down here

1531
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:15,072
in downtown Washington, D.C.

1532
01:55:15,074 --> 01:55:17,041
The national guard
has been brought in...

1533
01:55:17,043 --> 01:55:19,777
Attention! Attention!

1534
01:55:19,779 --> 01:55:22,146
By executive order,
all civilians

1535
01:55:22,148 --> 01:55:25,616
must immediately evacuate the
Pennsylvania Avenue corridor

1536
01:55:25,618 --> 01:55:28,586
between 3rd
and 12th streets northwest.

1537
01:55:36,262 --> 01:55:38,796
It is the final days
of tribulation

1538
01:55:38,798 --> 01:55:41,032
that is happening to us now.

1539
01:55:41,034 --> 01:55:44,535
Can you see
what your sinfulness has done?

1540
01:55:44,537 --> 01:55:46,170
Your greed?

1541
01:55:46,172 --> 01:55:48,975
You gotta do something!
You gotta do something!

1542
01:55:50,209 --> 01:55:53,146
Come on! This way! Come on!

1543
01:55:57,951 --> 01:55:59,583
Riley!

1544
01:55:59,585 --> 01:56:01,252
All units.

1545
01:56:01,254 --> 01:56:02,353
Riley!

1546
01:56:02,355 --> 01:56:04,755
We need help.

1547
01:56:04,757 --> 01:56:07,291
- It's chaos out here.
- Riley!

1548
01:56:07,293 --> 01:56:11,162
What do you want me to do?
I don't know what to do.

1549
01:56:11,164 --> 01:56:13,431
Somebody help me.

1550
01:56:13,433 --> 01:56:15,835
I don't know what to do.

1551
01:56:20,073 --> 01:56:21,674
Diana.

1552
01:56:22,475 --> 01:56:24,510
Diana, listen to me.

1553
01:56:29,048 --> 01:56:32,518
I had a great life.

1554
01:56:33,286 --> 01:56:34,485
Steve...

1555
01:56:34,487 --> 01:56:37,123
And you only made it better.

1556
01:56:38,691 --> 01:56:42,093
But you know
what you need to do.

1557
01:56:42,095 --> 01:56:43,730
The world needs you.

1558
01:56:48,401 --> 01:56:50,534
- All right?
- No.

1559
01:56:50,536 --> 01:56:52,403
Yeah.

1560
01:57:05,218 --> 01:57:06,851
I'll never love again.

1561
01:57:06,853 --> 01:57:08,986
I pray that isn't true.

1562
01:57:08,988 --> 01:57:12,089
There's a wonderful,
big world out there.

1563
01:57:12,091 --> 01:57:15,826
This crazy new world.

1564
01:57:15,828 --> 01:57:19,065
And I am so happy
I got to see it...

1565
01:57:19,799 --> 01:57:22,135
but it deserves you.

1566
01:57:32,111 --> 01:57:37,016
I can't say goodbye.

1567
01:57:37,717 --> 01:57:39,819
You don't have to.

1568
01:57:43,656 --> 01:57:46,359
I'm already gone.

1569
01:58:00,339 --> 01:58:02,406
I'll always love you, Diana,

1570
01:58:02,408 --> 01:58:05,342
no matter where I am.

1571
01:58:05,344 --> 01:58:07,244
I love you.

1572
01:58:09,749 --> 01:58:12,450
I renounce my wish.

1573
01:59:07,373 --> 01:59:08,841
It's easy.

1574
01:59:10,943 --> 01:59:14,013
It's only wind and air...

1575
01:59:15,448 --> 01:59:17,316
and how to ride it.

1576
01:59:19,418 --> 01:59:21,687
How to catch it.

1577
02:00:34,594 --> 02:00:35,995
You made a wish too, huh?

1578
02:00:40,199 --> 02:00:42,166
They're a bitch, aren't they?

1579
02:00:42,168 --> 02:00:45,803
Make you pay a price,
but I've never been one for rules.

1580
02:00:45,805 --> 02:00:48,007
Luckily, I have a way
to reverse it.

1581
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:51,842
The answer is always more.

1582
02:00:51,844 --> 02:00:53,644
But you only get one wish.

1583
02:00:53,646 --> 02:00:56,347
But I, my dear,
grant the wishes.

1584
02:00:56,349 --> 02:00:59,583
So I take
what I want in return.

1585
02:00:59,585 --> 02:01:02,586
There's nothing in this world
someone doesn't have.

1586
02:01:02,588 --> 02:01:06,292
I'll rebuild my health,
wish by wish, organ by organ...

1587
02:01:06,959 --> 02:01:08,427
if I have to.

1588
02:01:09,762 --> 02:01:11,530
I'll be invincible.

1589
02:01:13,065 --> 02:01:14,632
Tell me,

1590
02:01:14,634 --> 02:01:16,767
what do you want?

1591
02:01:16,769 --> 02:01:19,105
I'm feeling generous.

1592
02:01:22,208 --> 02:01:26,512
I don't want to be
like anyone anymore.

1593
02:01:28,614 --> 02:01:31,083
I want to be number one.

1594
02:01:33,653 --> 02:01:36,387
An apex predator,

1595
02:01:36,389 --> 02:01:40,026
like nothing
there's ever been before.

1596
02:01:41,060 --> 02:01:43,896
I like the way you think.

1597
02:01:45,131 --> 02:01:46,465
Go on.

1598
02:01:59,245 --> 02:02:03,113
You heard we were
coming, I presume?

1599
02:02:03,115 --> 02:02:06,083
How many broadcasting signals
can I take over at once?

1600
02:02:06,085 --> 02:02:08,519
Well, as many as you like, sir.

1601
02:02:08,521 --> 02:02:09,987
I'll take all of them.

1602
02:02:09,989 --> 02:02:11,989
All of them?

1603
02:02:11,991 --> 02:02:16,727
And I sure wish this works
for me. Don't you?

1604
02:02:16,729 --> 02:02:18,329
Yes, sir.

1605
02:02:21,033 --> 02:02:23,467
Lights, camera...

1606
02:02:23,469 --> 02:02:25,035
Okay, stations 12,

1607
02:02:25,037 --> 02:02:27,237
9, 16, go transmit.

1608
02:02:27,239 --> 02:02:30,140
I need it now.
16, 9, 12. Do you receive?

1609
02:02:30,142 --> 02:02:31,442
Copy. Maximum power.

1610
02:02:31,444 --> 02:02:32,843
Okay. Moving forward now.

1611
02:02:32,845 --> 02:02:34,645
Global transmission in five,

1612
02:02:34,647 --> 02:02:37,249
four, three, two...

1613
02:02:40,953 --> 02:02:43,287
Citizens of the world,

1614
02:02:43,289 --> 02:02:47,858
allow me to introduce myself.

1615
02:02:47,860 --> 02:02:50,494
I am Max Lord,

1616
02:02:50,496 --> 02:02:53,232
and I'm here
to change your life.

1617
02:02:54,066 --> 02:02:56,936
All you have to do...

1618
02:02:57,803 --> 02:02:59,972
is make a wish.

1619
02:03:00,973 --> 02:03:03,707
Anything you want.

1620
02:03:03,709 --> 02:03:06,445
Anything you dream of,
you can have it.

1621
02:03:07,780 --> 02:03:09,580
If you can dream it...

1622
02:03:09,582 --> 02:03:10,681
Daddy?

1623
02:03:10,683 --> 02:03:13,250
...you can achieve it.

1624
02:03:13,252 --> 02:03:16,255
So just look into my eyes...

1625
02:03:17,456 --> 02:03:19,857
and make a wish.

1626
02:03:19,859 --> 02:03:23,260
Anything you dream of,

1627
02:03:23,262 --> 02:03:24,430
have it.

1628
02:03:25,931 --> 02:03:28,565
Right now.

1629
02:03:28,567 --> 02:03:31,702
Do you want to be rich?

1630
02:03:31,704 --> 02:03:34,872
Do you want to be powerful?

1631
02:03:34,874 --> 02:03:36,440
Yeah, yeah.
Whatever you say.

1632
02:03:36,442 --> 02:03:38,041
- Say it out loud!
- You know what I wish?

1633
02:03:38,043 --> 02:03:39,476
- What? What?
- I wish all you Irish bastards

1634
02:03:39,478 --> 02:03:41,979
would get sent back
to where you came from!

1635
02:03:41,981 --> 02:03:43,447
Yeah? Well, I wish
you'd drop dead!

1636
02:03:43,449 --> 02:03:46,517
Look around you.

1637
02:03:46,519 --> 02:03:48,952
Make your wish!

1638
02:03:48,954 --> 02:03:50,888
Take what's yours.

1639
02:03:50,890 --> 02:03:52,890
Whatever you want,

1640
02:03:52,892 --> 02:03:54,558
you can have it.

1641
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:56,429
I wish for a million dollars.

1642
02:04:02,001 --> 02:04:03,700
Wish for it.

1643
02:04:16,148 --> 02:04:18,649
[MaxwelAnything you want.

1644
02:04:18,651 --> 02:04:22,988
Anything you dream of, have it.

1645
02:04:23,622 --> 02:04:24,955
Yes.

1646
02:04:24,957 --> 02:04:26,457
I can hear it.

1647
02:04:26,459 --> 02:04:29,460
I hear you.

1648
02:04:29,462 --> 02:04:30,561
Yes, say it.

1649
02:04:30,563 --> 02:04:32,296
Say it out loud.

1650
02:04:32,298 --> 02:04:34,233
That's right.
"I wish."

1651
02:04:35,668 --> 02:04:36,767
Take it.

1652
02:04:36,769 --> 02:04:39,102
Take it. It's all yours.

1653
02:04:39,104 --> 02:04:41,038
It's all yours for the taking!

1654
02:04:45,444 --> 02:04:48,514
And I... I take your health

1655
02:04:49,081 --> 02:04:51,515
and your strength.

1656
02:04:51,517 --> 02:04:53,050
Give her your rage

1657
02:04:53,052 --> 02:04:55,085
and your prowess.

1658
02:04:55,087 --> 02:04:58,088
And I take your power.

1659
02:04:58,090 --> 02:05:00,390
I take your life force.

1660
02:05:00,392 --> 02:05:02,326
Yes.

1661
02:05:02,328 --> 02:05:03,729
Yes!

1662
02:05:06,065 --> 02:05:07,931
That's right.

1663
02:05:07,933 --> 02:05:10,767
You're doing great.

1664
02:05:16,775 --> 02:05:18,709
It's all yours.

1665
02:05:18,711 --> 02:05:20,177
I wish you were here, Daddy.

1666
02:05:20,179 --> 02:05:22,079
I wish you'd come back.
Daddy, please!

1667
02:05:22,081 --> 02:05:25,182
- All you have to do is wish for it.
- I'm still here, Daddy.

1668
02:05:25,184 --> 02:05:27,219
Daddy, please!

1669
02:06:40,726 --> 02:06:42,661
Barbara.

1670
02:06:43,295 --> 02:06:45,764
What did you do?

1671
02:08:33,238 --> 02:08:34,406
No.

1672
02:08:35,774 --> 02:08:37,941
You renounced your wish.

1673
02:08:37,943 --> 02:08:40,844
I had to. And so do you.

1674
02:08:40,846 --> 02:08:44,514
Nothing good is born
from lies, Barbara.

1675
02:08:44,516 --> 02:08:47,384
We're wasting precious time.

1676
02:08:47,386 --> 02:08:51,724
Even now, patronizing me.

1677
02:10:21,413 --> 02:10:23,246
Barbara...

1678
02:10:23,248 --> 02:10:25,148
I know you're in there. Please.

1679
02:10:25,150 --> 02:10:26,950
Please, renounce your wish.

1680
02:10:26,952 --> 02:10:28,318
It's over.

1681
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:30,320
Please!

1682
02:10:30,322 --> 02:10:32,189
Renounce your wish.

1683
02:10:32,191 --> 02:10:33,158
Never!

1684
02:10:36,562 --> 02:10:38,664
Then I'm so sorry.

1685
02:11:21,406 --> 02:11:22,906
That's right.

1686
02:11:22,908 --> 02:11:24,641
Just wish for it.

1687
02:11:24,643 --> 02:11:26,178
It's yours now.

1688
02:11:27,479 --> 02:11:30,113
All you have to do is
say it out loud.

1689
02:11:30,115 --> 02:11:32,749
Make a wish. Any wish.

1690
02:11:32,751 --> 02:11:36,052
Look into my eyes,
and everything you've been waiting for,

1691
02:11:36,054 --> 02:11:37,587
it's all yours.

1692
02:11:37,589 --> 02:11:38,688
You're too late.

1693
02:11:40,425 --> 02:11:42,194
Granted.

1694
02:11:43,128 --> 02:11:44,696
Granted.

1695
02:11:45,330 --> 02:11:47,165
Granted.

1696
02:11:48,033 --> 02:11:49,833
Granted!

1697
02:11:49,835 --> 02:11:52,602
- Granted.
- Why are you doing this?

1698
02:11:52,604 --> 02:11:54,404
Don't you have enough?

1699
02:11:54,406 --> 02:11:56,373
Why not more?

1700
02:11:56,375 --> 02:11:58,074
Why not wish for more?

1701
02:11:58,076 --> 02:12:00,577
But they don't know
what you're taking from them.

1702
02:12:00,579 --> 02:12:02,712
We want what we want.

1703
02:12:02,714 --> 02:12:04,583
Just like you did.

1704
02:12:06,485 --> 02:12:08,151
So make a wish.

1705
02:12:08,153 --> 02:12:09,187
Very good.

1706
02:12:19,298 --> 02:12:21,533
Granted.

1707
02:12:23,368 --> 02:12:26,136
It's too late, Diana.

1708
02:12:26,138 --> 02:12:28,638
They already heard me.

1709
02:12:28,640 --> 02:12:31,109
Already wished!

1710
02:12:32,945 --> 02:12:37,082
And those that haven't yet...

1711
02:12:39,217 --> 02:12:42,352
oh, they will!

1712
02:12:55,434 --> 02:12:59,771
Granted.

1713
02:13:00,806 --> 02:13:02,272
Granted.

1714
02:13:08,013 --> 02:13:10,215
Poor Diana.

1715
02:13:11,249 --> 02:13:13,652
Why be such a hero?

1716
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:17,487
You could have kept your pilot

1717
02:13:17,489 --> 02:13:19,289
and your powers,

1718
02:13:19,291 --> 02:13:22,525
if only you'd join me.

1719
02:13:22,527 --> 02:13:25,864
Wanna reconsider?

1720
02:13:26,732 --> 02:13:30,002
I'm a forgiving man!

1721
02:13:34,039 --> 02:13:36,172
You want him back?

1722
02:13:36,174 --> 02:13:38,608
Just say the word.

1723
02:13:38,610 --> 02:13:41,344
You can have it all!

1724
02:13:41,346 --> 02:13:45,650
You just have to want it!

1725
02:13:47,586 --> 02:13:50,922
I've never wanted
anything more.

1726
02:13:56,661 --> 02:13:59,729
But he's gone...

1727
02:13:59,731 --> 02:14:02,866
and that's the truth.

1728
02:14:02,868 --> 02:14:05,368
And everything has a price.

1729
02:14:05,370 --> 02:14:07,971
One I'm not willing to pay.

1730
02:14:07,973 --> 02:14:09,574
Not anymore.

1731
02:14:16,148 --> 02:14:21,319
This world was a beautiful
place just as it was...

1732
02:14:22,454 --> 02:14:25,822
and you cannot have it all.

1733
02:14:25,824 --> 02:14:29,526
You can only have the truth.

1734
02:14:29,528 --> 02:14:32,595
And the truth is enough.

1735
02:14:32,597 --> 02:14:35,000
The truth is beautiful.

1736
02:14:37,869 --> 02:14:40,138
So look at this world...

1737
02:14:41,339 --> 02:14:45,909
and look at what your wish
is costing it.

1738
02:14:45,911 --> 02:14:49,913
You must be the hero.

1739
02:14:49,915 --> 02:14:53,618
Only you can save the day.

1740
02:14:55,120 --> 02:14:57,921
Renounce your wish

1741
02:14:57,923 --> 02:15:00,223
if you want to save this world.

1742
02:15:00,225 --> 02:15:02,659
Why would I...

1743
02:15:02,661 --> 02:15:06,364
when it's finally my turn?

1744
02:15:07,833 --> 02:15:11,568
The world belongs to me!

1745
02:15:11,570 --> 02:15:15,674
You can't stop me. No one can!

1746
02:15:16,842 --> 02:15:19,044
I wasn't talking to you.

1747
02:15:26,685 --> 02:15:30,155
I was talking to everyone else.

1748
02:15:34,226 --> 02:15:37,696
Because you're not the only one
who has suffered.

1749
02:15:39,131 --> 02:15:40,365
Who wants more.

1750
02:15:44,402 --> 02:15:47,672
Who wants them back.

1751
02:15:49,174 --> 02:15:52,310
Who doesn't want
to be afraid anymore.

1752
02:15:55,714 --> 02:15:57,814
Or alone.

1753
02:15:57,816 --> 02:15:59,415
Stop!

1754
02:15:59,417 --> 02:16:01,684
Cut the signal! Stop!

1755
02:16:01,686 --> 02:16:03,786
Or frightened.

1756
02:16:03,788 --> 02:16:06,456
Or powerless.

1757
02:16:06,458 --> 02:16:10,193
'Cause you're not the only one
who imagined a world

1758
02:16:10,195 --> 02:16:13,765
where everything was different.

1759
02:16:18,069 --> 02:16:19,369
Better.

1760
02:16:19,371 --> 02:16:22,107
Finally.

1761
02:16:25,477 --> 02:16:29,712
A world where they were loved

1762
02:16:29,714 --> 02:16:33,051
and seen, and appreciated.

1763
02:16:33,552 --> 02:16:34,684
Finally.

1764
02:16:34,686 --> 02:16:36,753
Oh, my God. Who is he?

1765
02:16:36,755 --> 02:16:38,955
He doesn't even speak English.

1766
02:16:38,957 --> 02:16:40,823
What is he eating?

1767
02:16:40,825 --> 02:16:41,958
Look at his shoes!

1768
02:16:43,395 --> 02:16:44,396
Weirdo!

1769
02:17:04,015 --> 02:17:07,884
But what is it costing you?

1770
02:17:07,886 --> 02:17:10,422
Do you see the truth?

1771
02:17:22,567 --> 02:17:23,535
Daddy!

1772
02:17:25,203 --> 02:17:27,239
Daddy!

1773
02:17:37,082 --> 02:17:40,950
The Russians are launching.
We've got orders to counter.

1774
02:17:40,952 --> 02:17:42,954
All right, all right.

1775
02:18:00,438 --> 02:18:02,472
Alistair!

1776
02:18:03,742 --> 02:18:05,208
Emergency alert.

1777
02:18:05,210 --> 02:18:07,543
You have four minutes
to find shelter.

1778
02:18:12,384 --> 02:18:14,617
Alistair!

1779
02:18:14,619 --> 02:18:16,986
My son!

1780
02:18:16,988 --> 02:18:19,789
Stay calm
and stay indoors.

1781
02:18:19,791 --> 02:18:21,658
Alistair!

1782
02:18:21,660 --> 02:18:24,627
Daddy! Daddy!

1783
02:18:24,629 --> 02:18:25,795
Help me, Daddy!

1784
02:18:25,797 --> 02:18:27,463
This is not a test.

1785
02:18:27,465 --> 02:18:28,631
Daddy!

1786
02:18:31,236 --> 02:18:32,735
Daddy!

1787
02:18:32,737 --> 02:18:34,472
One-minute warning.

1788
02:18:35,540 --> 02:18:37,573
Wait. My son!

1789
02:18:37,575 --> 02:18:39,509
I can see my son!

1790
02:18:39,511 --> 02:18:41,346
Save him, Max.

1791
02:18:42,814 --> 02:18:44,614
I have to save my son.

1792
02:18:44,616 --> 02:18:46,316
Daddy!

1793
02:18:46,318 --> 02:18:47,517
Alistair.

1794
02:18:47,519 --> 02:18:51,056
Daddy!

1795
02:18:51,623 --> 02:18:54,426
My... Alistair.

1796
02:18:55,694 --> 02:18:58,163
I renounce my wish!

1797
02:19:12,744 --> 02:19:14,446
I renounce my wish.

1798
02:19:17,782 --> 02:19:20,385
We have missiles
disappearing, sir.

1799
02:19:21,386 --> 02:19:22,618
Yes, sir.

1800
02:19:22,620 --> 02:19:25,056
They are vanishing
from our screen.

1801
02:19:28,426 --> 02:19:30,827
Only just hearing
now that a ceasefire

1802
02:19:30,829 --> 02:19:33,363
between the Soviet Union
and the United States

1803
02:19:33,365 --> 02:19:36,099
has averted
a global nuclear crisis.

1804
02:19:37,902 --> 02:19:39,637
I renounce my wish.

1805
02:19:57,722 --> 02:19:59,255
- I take back my wish.
- I renounce my wish.

1806
02:20:21,579 --> 02:20:23,948
Alistair!

1807
02:20:30,388 --> 02:20:32,290
Alistair!

1808
02:20:32,657 --> 02:20:35,326
Alistair!

1809
02:20:37,729 --> 02:20:38,696
Daddy!

1810
02:20:45,170 --> 02:20:47,238
- Daddy!
- Alistair!

1811
02:20:51,342 --> 02:20:52,677
Alistair.

1812
02:20:56,147 --> 02:20:58,247
Oh, Alistair, Alistair.

1813
02:20:58,249 --> 02:21:00,718
I'm so sorry, baby.

1814
02:21:02,687 --> 02:21:06,991
I'm so glad I wished you'd come.
I knew it would work.

1815
02:21:09,761 --> 02:21:11,029
No.

1816
02:21:11,963 --> 02:21:14,132
That is not why I'm back.

1817
02:21:14,666 --> 02:21:15,733
No.

1818
02:21:17,702 --> 02:21:20,004
I've been lying to you.

1819
02:21:21,206 --> 02:21:24,474
I'm not a great guy.

1820
02:21:24,476 --> 02:21:27,378
In fact, I'm a pretty
messed up, loser guy.

1821
02:21:29,247 --> 02:21:32,217
And I made terrible mistakes.

1822
02:21:32,917 --> 02:21:34,686
But you...

1823
02:21:36,621 --> 02:21:40,425
you don't ever have to make
a wish for me to love you.

1824
02:21:41,860 --> 02:21:44,429
I'm here because I love you.

1825
02:21:46,698 --> 02:21:48,631
I just...

1826
02:21:48,633 --> 02:21:51,033
I just wish and I pray that,
one day,

1827
02:21:51,035 --> 02:21:52,568
I'll be able to
make you proud enough

1828
02:21:52,570 --> 02:21:55,406
that you'll be
able to forgive me.

1829
02:21:56,808 --> 02:21:58,674
And love me.

1830
02:21:58,676 --> 02:22:01,844
Because I'm nothing
to be proud of, Alistair.

1831
02:22:01,846 --> 02:22:04,947
I don't need you
to make me proud.

1832
02:22:04,949 --> 02:22:07,517
I already love you, Daddy.

1833
02:22:07,519 --> 02:22:09,654
You're my dad.

1834
02:22:56,501 --> 02:22:59,402
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Sorry.

1835
02:22:59,404 --> 02:23:02,004
It's okay. It's okay.

1836
02:23:06,945 --> 02:23:09,314
So beautiful.

1837
02:23:14,285 --> 02:23:18,823
Sorry.
Just talking to myself.

1838
02:23:21,059 --> 02:23:23,025
It's all right.

1839
02:23:23,027 --> 02:23:24,760
It's just that...

1840
02:23:24,762 --> 02:23:29,834
It's wonderful.
It's so many things.

1841
02:23:30,835 --> 02:23:32,437
Yeah.

1842
02:23:33,304 --> 02:23:35,473
I know what you mean.

1843
02:23:40,812 --> 02:23:42,845
I like your...

1844
02:23:42,847 --> 02:23:44,182
I like your outfit.

1845
02:23:44,649 --> 02:23:46,215
You like...

1846
02:23:46,217 --> 02:23:47,350
Thanks.

1847
02:23:47,352 --> 02:23:49,452
You know, my friends...

1848
02:23:49,454 --> 02:23:52,922
they kinda tease me about it,
but it works, right?

1849
02:23:52,924 --> 02:23:54,824
- You look great.
- Thank you.

1850
02:23:54,826 --> 02:23:57,328
You just made my day.

1851
02:24:04,869 --> 02:24:07,905
- Happy holidays. See you around.
- Happy holidays.

1852
02:24:47,912 --> 02:24:51,249
So many things.

1853
02:24:53,418 --> 02:24:57,288
So, so many things.

1854
02:26:33,217 --> 02:26:35,151
- Whoa!
- Look out!

1855
02:26:37,855 --> 02:26:39,457
Oh, my God.

1856
02:26:41,125 --> 02:26:43,025
- Mom, would you take her?
- Yeah.

1857
02:26:43,027 --> 02:26:44,760
Um, excuse me.

1858
02:26:44,762 --> 02:26:47,865
Excuse me. Please,
you have to let me thank you, Miss...

1859
00:01:49,133 --> 02:26:50,432

1860
02:26:50,434 --> 02:26:53,235
Asteria. Wow.
That's a beautiful name.

1861
02:26:53,237 --> 02:26:54,804
It's from my culture.

1862
02:26:54,806 --> 02:26:57,239
I can't thank you enough.
I mean, you saved my daughter.

1863
02:26:57,241 --> 02:26:59,041
How did you do that?

1864
02:26:59,043 --> 02:27:03,045
It's just a simple shift of weight.
Takes practice.

1865
02:27:03,047 --> 02:27:06,651
But I've been
doing this a long time.
