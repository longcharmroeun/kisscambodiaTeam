Sergeant Vrataski.

615
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,408
Excuse me.

616
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,725
Sergeant Vrataski?

617
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,722
<font color="#80FF00">(ALARM SOUNDING)</font>

618
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,322
Excuse me.

619
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,971
Yes? Who said you
could talk to me?

620
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,644
Have I got something on my face?

621
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,524
You did. You did.

622
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,564
Tomorrow. At the beach.

623
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,604
Tomorrow. At the beach.

624
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,962
We meet.

625
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,571
You said to find you
when I wake up.

626
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,927
You do know what's
happening to me.

627
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,491
Come with me.

628
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,440
Now.

629
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,411
You don't talk to anyone
about this but me.

630
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,530
The best-case scenario is you're
gonna end up in a psych ward.

631
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,046
Worst case, you'll get...

632
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,970
...dissected for study.
Are we clear?

633
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,446
- Yes?
- Yes.

634
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,364
First time you died,
what happened?

635
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,886
- You killed a mimic?
- Yes.

636
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,640
- Describe it.
- It was different.

637
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,611
It was bigger. Bluish.

638
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,882
And you got covered
in its blood.

639
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,563
As a matter of fact, I did.

640
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,366
They know we're coming
on the beach tomorrow.

641
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,443
It's a slaughter, isn't it?

642
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,328
How do you know this?

643
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,371
Could you just...? Wait!

644
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,324
Wait. Wait.

645
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,691
Would you explain to me
what the hell is happening.

646
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,447
What happened to you
happened to me.

647
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,842
I had it. I lost it. Okay?

648
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,606
That's great. There's a cure.
How do I get rid of this?

649
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,251
First, I need your help.

650
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,801
Help with what exactly?

651
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,165
Winning the war.

652
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,160
Let's go! Come on!

653
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,240
<font color="#ffff00">CARTER</font>: Rita, what is this?

654
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,926
What are you doing here? You
gotta give me some warning.

655
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,249
- Who's this?
- He's me. Before Verdun.

656
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,925
He's gonna help us.

657
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,883
What? You mean he's...?

658
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,121
Yes.

659
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,727
When did he die? Where?

660
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,927
On the beach. Tomorrow.

661
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,480
How many fingers am I
holding up behind my back?

662
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,291
How should I know that?

663
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,483
<font color="#ffff00">CARTER</font>: Okay.

664
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,486
So this is the first time
we've had this conversation.

665
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,927
- You should try this on him.
- What is that?

666
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,491
It doesn't work.

667
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,920
Has he had any visions yet?

668
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,042
Visions of what?

669
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,287
There's still time.

670
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,249
- Yes.
- Time? Look, I'm sorry.

671
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,164
Who is this? Who are you?

672
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,289
I'm Dr. Carter. Particle physics.
Advanced microbiology.

673
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,408
He's also the only other person who'll
believe what's happening to you.

674
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,642
No one understands mimic
biology better than him.

675
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,445
He's a top analyst at Whitehall.

676
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,849
Well, I mean, I was until I
met Rita and now I'm just...

677
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,208
...a "mechanic with
psychiatric delusions."

678
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,362
Carter.

679
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,801
Show him.

680
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,806
Yeah, right.

681
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,490
Right. Well, first of all...

682
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,975
...you're not fighting an army.

683
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,402
You have to think of this
as a single organism.

684
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,923
Now, these common drones,
they act like...

685
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:02,769
...its claws.

686
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,806
And Alphas, like the one that
you killed, are much more rare.

687
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,241
<font color="#ffff00">CARTER</font>: Yeah. They're
like one in...

688
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,040
...6.18 million, by my guess.
<font color="#ffff00">RITA</font>: Yes.

689
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,605
They act as the enemy's...

690
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,480
They're like its central
nervous system.

691
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,210
But this...

692
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,090
...is the brain.

693
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,529
It controls them all.
And this is the Omega.

694
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,366
And the Omega has the
ability to control time.

695
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,562
Whenever an Alpha is killed...

696
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,246
...an automatic
response is triggered.

697
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,046
The Omega starts the
day over again.

698
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,608
But you see, this time, it can
remember what's going to happen...

699
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,285
...just like you do.

700
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,601
<font color="#ffff00">CARTER</font>: It knows exactly...

701
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,735
...what we're gonna do
before we're gonna do it.

702
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,411
- And an enemy that knows the future can't lose.
- It can't lose.

703
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,169
But if that's true, how
did you win at Verdun?

704
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,323
We were allowed to win.

705
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,370
This thing wants us to
believe we can win.

706
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,683
It wants us to throw everything
we have into the invasion.

707
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,810
Operation Downfall
isn't our endgame...

708
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,690
...it's the enemy's.

709
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,570
<font color="#ffff00">CARTER</font>: The thing you've
got to understand is...

710
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,167
...this is a
perfectly evolved...

711
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,687
...world-conquering organism.

712
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,445
For all we know, there are
millions of those asteroids...

713
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,080
...floating around
in the cosmos...

714
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,406
...like a virus.

715
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,562
They're just waiting...

716
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,371
...to crash-land into a world
with just the right conditions.

717
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,002
All they need is for the dominant
life form to attack and:

718
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,695
<font color="#ffff00">RITA</font>: There'll be nothing
to stop the mimics...

719
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,643
...from conquering the
rest of the world.

720
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,162
Unless you change the outcome.

721
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,766
Me?

722
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,691
When you killed that Alpha, you inadvertently
entered the enemy's nervous system.

723
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,928
Cage, you've seized control...

724
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,686
...of the Omega's ability
to reset the day.

725
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,735
- <font color="#ffff00">HOW'S THAT EVEN POSSIBLE? CARTER</font>:
Perhaps this organism's...

726
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,650
...only vulnerability, its
only vulnerability...

727
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,881
...is humanity.

728
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,727
Regardless of that, you
control the power now.

729
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,883
Just as I did in Verdun.

730
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,920
So I'm resetting the day?

731
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,886
Okay.

732
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,801
How do I control it?

733
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,730
You have to die.

734
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,760
Every day.

735
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,042
Until the Omega's destroyed.

736
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,245
First of all...

737
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,403
...this is a terrific
presentation.

738
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,205
Terrific.

739
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,725
I know the general.

740
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,689
We should take this to him.

741
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,808
- You just tell him everything you told me.
- I went to see the general.

742
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,483
Any number of times.

743
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,284
Psych ward. Dissection.
Remember?

744
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,846
What are you expecting from me?

745
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,404
Have you seen anything strange?

746
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,961
Is he shitting me?

747
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,042
Visions.

748
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,487
Visions. Have you seen
any visions like that?

749
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,009
The Omega senses when
it's losing control...

750
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,084
...of its power. Even now it's
mentally searching to find you.

751
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,004
<font color="#ffff00">RITA</font>: When it's close
to finding you...

752
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,210
...you will start having visions.
You'll start to see that.

753
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,687
You'll even see where it is.

754
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,726
And you had these visions?

755
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,406
Yes.

756
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,443
But eventually you saw it. I
mean, you actually saw it.

757
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,806
Right?

758
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,447
Never in the flesh.

759
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,442
So this is all just some...

760
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,680
...theory.

761
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,931
You don't know if this
thing even exists.

762
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,721
The visions showed me it was at Verdun.
I could see it. I...

763
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,926
I just...

764
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,561
...lost the power before
I could get to it.

765
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,921
<font color="#ffff00">CARTER</font>: And by the
time we took...

766
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,161
...Verdun...

767
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,362
...the Omega was gone.

768
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,008
Okay. So all I have to do is...

769
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,203
...wait to have these visions...

770
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,967
...and then tell you where
this Omega thing is.

771
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,765
No. Cage.

772
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,368
You're gonna get me there.

773
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,126
And I'm gonna kill it.

774
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,686
Get you there?

775
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,842
I'm not even trained for combat.

780
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,605
I think I broke something.

781
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,086
What?

782
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,121
My back.

783
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,766
The only thing I can
feel are my lips.

784
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,767

is a very important rule.

785

This is the only rule.

You get injured on the field,
you better make sure you die.

788
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,963
Last time I was in combat...

789
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,366
...I was hit.

790
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,810
I was bleeding out.
Just not fast enough.

791
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,800
I woke up in a field hospital...

792
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,482
...with three pints of someone
else's blood and I was out.

793
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,689
I lost the power.
Do you understand?

794
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,480
Think we better start over.

795

You don't have time to think.
Remember.

809
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,680
It's not enough knowing
where they're going to be.

810
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,121
You have to know
how to kill them.

811
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,362
Hold on. Hold on.
Listen. List...

So maybe there's some way...

821
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,803
...I can transfer it to you.

Just for the record.

- It was pretty specific.

still working on my landing.

1083
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,569
What are we still doing here?

1084
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,360
- You're wasting time!
- Rita, if you start that engine, you die.

1085
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:33,129
This is as far as you go.

1086
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,765
No matter what I do...

1087
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,082
...this is as far as
you ever make it.

1088
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:49,202
There's a mimic
buried 20 yards away.

1089
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,169
It attacks when you
start the engine.

1090
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:55,126
Get your weapon and get
in the helicopter, Cage.

1091
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,488
There's more in the
field back there.

1092
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,005
Only one of us ever makes it.

<font color="#ffff00">RITA</font>: Get in.

1094
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:05,160
Only thing we haven't tried is you
walk away. Go to the farmhouse.

1095
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,406
There's a cellar, food.

1096
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:07,203
Wait there...

1097
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,363
...till I get back.
You'll be safe.

1098
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:12,849
I'm a soldier. I volunteered.
I'm not walking away.

1099
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:15,481
You die here. Right here.

1100
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,242
I can't save you.

1101
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:22,848
And if I go on and kill
the Omega, you're dead.

1102
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:24,127
Forever.

1103
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,806
Why does it matter
what happens to me?

1104
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,441
I wish...

1105
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,691
...I didn't know you.

1106
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,291
But I do.

1107
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,129
My middle name...

1108
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,890

Battle is the great redeemer.

I'm sorry to disturb
you, sergeant.

Let's get this show on the road.
I gotta suit up.

1120
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,321
Where's your helmet?

1121
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:56,569
Never wear one.
It's a distraction.

1122

Have you been drinking?

1123
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,362
I need three more
clips of 5.56...

1124
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:05,490
...eight grenades and
an extra battery.

1125
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,161

01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,681
They knew we were coming.
They ambushed us.

1138
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:37,450
The visions were a trap.

1139
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,247
Just like Rita's visions
were a trap at Verdun.

1140
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:45,251
It could have killed me, but it didn't.
It was after my blood.

1141
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:47,687
So they know who you are.
They...

1142
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,491
They want their power back.

1143
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,849
They're gonna get it one way or another.
Unless we find the Omega.

1144
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,090
- There isn't any other way. We're finished.
- No.

1145
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:58,283
We're not finished.

1146
01:15:58,520 --> 01:15:59,601
I can't get it to work.

1147
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,285
You built a prototype
at Whitehall.

1148
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:03,841
<font color="#ffff00">CARTER</font>: Yes, and I got fired
for it, thank you very much.

1149
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:05,884
- What is this thing?
- It's a transponder.

1150
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:09,164
Stick it into the Alpha and it taps into
the wavelength connecting it to the Omega.

1151
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,209
That's the idea, anyway.

1152
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,920
I can't get it to work. Not
with the equipment I have.

1153
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,131
How do we get what you need?

1154
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:20,931
That's the thing. When I was
at Whitehall, I built one.

1155
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,650
I was even ready to test it.

1156
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,201
When I told my superiors
about it, I lost my job.

1157
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:26,726
They thought he was crazy.

1158
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:28,811
So we need to go to Whitehall.

Aren't you forgetting something?

1163
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,042
The transponder requires a
live Alpha to make it work.

1164
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:40,890
We don't need one.

manipulate time.

1235
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:55,488
The invasion will fail. No matter
how many bodies you throw at it.

1236
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:57,924
The only way to win
this war is...

1237
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:02,165
...by finding this power source of
the mimic horde and killing it.

1238
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:05,489
And the only means of finding
it is in that safe right there.

1239
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,970
No matter how many times we
have this conversation...

1240
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:13,483
...you refuse to accept that the enemy
breaks through to London tomorrow...

1241
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:16,690
...and we lose. We
lose everything.

1242
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,360
Let's say for one moment...

1243
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,440
...that I can't
rationally explain...

1244
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:31,490
...your impressive
parlor tricks.

1245
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:36,921
Dr. Carter told me...

1246
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:40,323
...this device requires a live mimic
to work. What use is it to you?

1247
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,000
- That's my concern.
<font color="#ffff00">BRIGHAM</font>: On the contrary.

1248
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,008
According to you, this
concerns the whole world.

1249
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,969
Well, what would you do if you
believed everything I just told you?

1250
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:52,521
I would locate this...

1251
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:53,488
Omega.

1252
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:54,801
Bomb it out of existence.

1253
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:58,806
You're not mentally equipped to fight
this thing. And you never will be.

1254
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,930
What do we do now?

1255
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:20,531
I don't know. We've
never gotten this far.

1256
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:27,248
