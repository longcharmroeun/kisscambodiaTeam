all of those women...

548
00:41:22,586 --> 00:41:24,153
Somebody's protecting him.

549
00:41:24,155 --> 00:41:26,124
Who has the power to do that?

550
00:41:28,427 --> 00:41:30,829
Someone far beyond us here.

551
00:41:32,764 --> 00:41:35,166
We better stay off
the street for now.

552
00:41:36,601 --> 00:41:38,836
I wanna be
a Hunter-Warrior like you.

553
00:41:39,637 --> 00:41:41,338
Alita, that's impossible.

554
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,805
We could be a team.

555
00:41:42,807 --> 00:41:44,640
Alita, this is dangerous,
dirty work.

556
00:41:44,642 --> 00:41:46,443
- I know.
- No, you don't.

557
00:41:46,445 --> 00:41:47,979
How is that
your choice to make?

558
00:41:48,713 --> 00:41:49,845
It's out of the question.

559
00:41:49,847 --> 00:41:51,713
I might need
a life-or-death situation

560
00:41:51,715 --> 00:41:53,015
to remember who I was.

561
00:41:53,017 --> 00:41:55,151
Even if it's just
for a second.

562
00:41:55,153 --> 00:41:57,320
Alita, some things are
better left forgotten.

563
00:41:57,322 --> 00:42:00,256
I don't want blood
on these hands, too.

564
00:42:00,258 --> 00:42:02,160
Then I'll find out
for myself.

I'll introduce you around.

586
00:43:37,356 --> 00:43:38,924
Who's the top player?

587
00:43:41,526 --> 00:43:42,524
Right now, I'd say Jashugan

588
00:43:42,526 --> 00:43:44,693
has the best chance
of making Final Champion.

589
00:43:44,695 --> 00:43:47,095
Camber's still off
in the left bogie.

590

What's Final Champion?

592
00:43:51,436 --> 00:43:54,169
It's the best thing
a Motorball player can win.

593
00:43:54,171 --> 00:43:57,106
Every few years, they choose a
player that can't be beaten...

594
00:43:57,108 --> 00:43:58,841
and he gets to go to Zalem.

smooth is fast.

Do it once, do it right.

598
00:44:04,916 --> 00:44:07,119
