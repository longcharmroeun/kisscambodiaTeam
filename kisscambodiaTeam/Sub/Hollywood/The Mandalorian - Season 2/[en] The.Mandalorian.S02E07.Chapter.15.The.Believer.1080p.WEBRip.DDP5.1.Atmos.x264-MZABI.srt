You get a better view.

66
00:05:12,518 --> 00:05:15,098
All right, but here's the thing.
I can't get those coordinates

67
00:05:15,187 --> 00:05:17,937
unless I have access
to an internal Imperial terminal.

68
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:20,901
I believe there's one on Morak.

69

THE MANDALORIAN: Morak?
There's nothing on Morak.

70

It's a secret Imperial mining hub, okay?

I can get you the coordinates.

Yeah, that's the refinery right there.

77
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,600
Wonder what they're refining in there.

78
00:05:54,685 --> 00:05:59,355

gotta get me the hell out of there.

I'll drop in and pull you out.

for the drivers in the tunnel.

with Rebel-dropper here,

88
00:06:45,402 --> 00:06:46,702
that's not gonna work.

89
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:48,319
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

90
00:06:48,405 --> 00:06:51,655
Well, because these Remnant bases
are set up and run by ex-ISB.

91
00:06:52,243 --> 00:06:54,163
If you get scanned
and your genetic signature

92
00:06:54,245 --> 00:06:56,655
shows up on any New Republic register,

93
00:06:56,747 --> 00:06:59,167

and it's guns out.

a lot about Imperial Remnants.

then just say it.

I'll trip the alarm, too.

00:07:11,595 --> 00:07:13,555

they might recognize my face.

102
00:07:16,892 --> 00:07:19,602

he'll tip 'em off. He'll be a hero.

I'm doin' you guys a favor.

Hey, buddy,
I might be good at fast-talking,

107
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,280
but I don't think I can explain away
a guy in a Mando suit to Imperial guards.

108
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:35,197
So, unless
you're gonna take off that helmet,

109
00:07:35,286 --> 00:07:36,696
it's gonna be me goin' in alone.

Yeah.

337
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,190
And all dead.

338
00:26:08,482 --> 00:26:11,532
VALIN HESS: Well, it's a small sacrifice
for the greater good, son.

339
00:26:13,612 --> 00:26:15,612
Depends on who you ask, don't you think?

340
00:26:16,532 --> 00:26:18,372
What you gettin' at, trooper?

341
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:21,406
All those people, the ones who died,

342
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,160
was it good for them?

343
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:26,879
Hmm? Their families?

344
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,460
The guys I served with?

345
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:35,676
Civilians, those poor mud scuffers,
died defendin' their homes,

346
00:26:37,261 --> 00:26:38,391
fighting for freedom.

347
00:26:39,388 --> 00:26:40,508
Was it good for 'em?

348
00:26:43,392 --> 00:26:45,732
But we've outlasted them, son.

349
00:26:46,395 --> 00:26:48,475
They're eatin' themselves alive.

350
00:26:49,148 --> 00:26:53,648
The New Republic is in complete disarray,
and we grow stronger.

351
00:26:54,862 --> 00:26:56,992
You see,
with the rhydonium you've delivered,

352
00:26:57,072 --> 00:27:02,332
we can create havoc that's gonna make
Burnin Konn just pale by comparison.

353
00:27:03,454 --> 00:27:05,754
And then they're gonna
turn to us once again.

354
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,760
You see, boys,
everybody thinks they want freedom,

355
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:19,890
but what they really want is order.

356
00:27:23,098 --> 00:27:24,638
And when they realize that,

357
00:27:26,477 --> 00:27:29,357
they're gonna welcome us back
with open arms.

358
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:34,859
Ah.

359
00:27:38,072 --> 00:27:39,242
