Wait here, I'll go get him.

361
00:39:22,067 --> 00:39:23,237
THE MANDALORIAN: Wake up, buddy.

362
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,946
It's time to say goodbye.

363
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,532
(COOS)

364
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,289
(WIND HOWLING)

365
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,009
(BABBLING)

366
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,178
(WHINING)

367
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,113
AHSOKA TANO: You're like a father to him.

368
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:07,784
I cannot train him.

369
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:16,155
THE MANDALORIAN: You made me a promise,
and I held up my end.

370
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,543
(SIGHS)

371
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,969
AHSOKA TANO: There is one possibility.

372
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,796
Go to the planet Tython.

373
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,560
You will find
the ancient ruins of a temple

374
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,889
that has a strong connection to the Force.

375
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,851
Place Grogu on the seeing stone
at the top of the mountain.

376
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,021
Then what?

377
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,016
Then Grogu may choose his path.

378
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,238
If he reaches out through the Force,

379
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,070
there's a chance a Jedi may sense
his presence and come searching for him.

380
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:56,661
Then again,

381
00:40:59,164 --> 00:41:00,624
there aren't many Jedi left.

382
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,212
(BABBLES SADLY)

383
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:06,836
THE MANDALORIAN: Thank you.

384
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,548
May the Force be with you.
