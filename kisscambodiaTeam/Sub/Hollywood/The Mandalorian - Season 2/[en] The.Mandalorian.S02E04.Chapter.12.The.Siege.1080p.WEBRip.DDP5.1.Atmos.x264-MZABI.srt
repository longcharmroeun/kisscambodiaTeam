But over on this side is the problem.

176
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:53,504
It's an old Imperial base.

177
00:11:53,586 --> 00:11:56,756
It's where all those troops came from
when we defeated Moff Gideon.

178
00:11:57,631 --> 00:12:00,051
This base has been here
since the Imperial expansion.

179
00:12:00,593 --> 00:12:03,853
It's got a skeleton crew, but for
some reason, it hasn't been abandoned.

180
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:05,969
There's a lot o'
heavy weaponry in that place

181
00:12:06,056 --> 00:12:09,016
the black market would love
to dismantle and get their hands on.

182
00:12:09,101 --> 00:12:12,311
And you wanna mop up the last
of the Imperial force before they do.

183
00:12:12,396 --> 00:12:14,476
Mando, I just want them off my planet.

184
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:19,819
If we could take out that one last base,
Nevarro would be completely safe.

185
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:23,029
We could be a trade anchor
for the entire sector.

186
00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:25,155
And the planet would finally be free.

187
00:12:30,998 --> 00:12:32,078
What are we looking at?

188
00:12:41,467 --> 00:12:44,137
The whole base is powered by a reactor.

189

and get the hell outta there.
