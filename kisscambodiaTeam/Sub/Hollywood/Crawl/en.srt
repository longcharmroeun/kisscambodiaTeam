Wayne!

499
00:45:57,892 --> 00:45:58,893
Down here!

500
00:45:59,627 --> 00:46:00,662
Wayne!

501
00:46:01,863 --> 00:46:02,897
Hey!

502
00:46:03,698 --> 00:46:05,165

Wayne!

He's heading to the garage!

514

[Wayne] Haley!

517

Wayne?

518
00:48:09,323 --> 00:48:11,259
No, Wayne, wait! Stop!

519
00:48:11,392 --> 00:48:13,427
- Stop! Wait, don't come down!
- [Dave yells]

520
00:48:13,561 --> 00:48:15,496
- No! Stay there!
- Hey!

521
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:18,666
Wait!
There's two gators down here!

522
00:48:19,901 --> 00:48:22,503
Okay, hold on.
Don't move. Hold on!

523
00:48:24,472 --> 00:48:27,308
- Come in, Pete.
- [radio static]

524

Pete, you copy?

525
00:48:29,777 --> 00:48:31,579
<i>Pete, do you copy?</i>

526
00:48:35,383 --> 00:48:36,617
Pete, goddamn it, man.
Where are you?

527
00:48:36,751 --> 00:48:38,953
I need you down here now
with a snare pole!

528
00:48:40,488 --> 00:48:42,423
Pete, did you hear that?

529

[Dave]
I got you.

540
00:50:07,408 --> 00:50:08,843
I couldn't save him.

541
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:18,052
It's okay. Shh.

542
00:50:19,053 --> 00:50:21,489
It's okay.
They can't get in here.

543
00:50:22,056 --> 00:50:23,457
We're safe here.

544
00:50:26,961 --> 00:50:27,929
Dad.

545
00:50:28,062 --> 00:50:29,096
Okay.

546
00:50:30,698 --> 00:50:32,900
Shh. It's okay.

547
00:50:33,034 --> 00:50:34,135
It's okay.

548
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:43,611
I never thought
it would end like this.

549
00:50:44,745 --> 00:50:46,981
We should never have
come back here.

550
00:50:47,114 --> 00:50:50,785
Haley, you stay strong.
We're getting out of here.

551
00:51:01,062 --> 00:51:04,031
You remember
when you were little,

552
00:51:04,165 --> 00:51:08,235
and Beth could hold her breath for the
length of the pool and you couldn't?

553
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:11,072
I'm not really up for
memory lane right now, Dad.

554
00:51:11,205 --> 00:51:14,875
Yeah, well, you got so mad
and you stormed off.

555
00:51:15,009 --> 00:51:17,478
Yeah, I was a little jerk.

556
00:51:17,611 --> 00:51:20,315
Yeah, well, Haley, that night,

557
00:51:20,449 --> 00:51:24,151
I woke up about 2:00 in the morning
'cause I heard something outside.

558
00:51:24,285 --> 00:51:26,421
I thought it was a burglar,
so I snuck down,

559
00:51:26,554 --> 00:51:28,457
and I saw you in the pool,

560
00:51:28,589 --> 00:51:31,926
taking your giant breaths
again and again.

561
00:51:33,362 --> 00:51:35,196
And you did it, Haley.

562
00:51:35,997 --> 00:51:38,866
You figured that shit out
all by yourself.

563
00:51:41,168 --> 00:51:45,039
And that's when I knew,
this kid's a fighter.

564
00:51:47,309 --> 00:51:50,678
So we may be stubborn,
but we do not give up.

565
00:51:53,482 --> 00:51:55,216
You gave up on Mom.

566
00:51:56,485 --> 00:51:59,520
Mom was not happy,
and I was selfish,

567
00:51:59,653 --> 00:52:01,423
and I didn't
pay enough attention to her.

568
00:52:01,555 --> 00:52:02,857
- Because of me.
- No.

569
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:05,993
Yes, because you were
always with me.

570
00:52:06,127 --> 00:52:10,064
Every weekend at the meets.
On the road away from home.

571
00:52:10,197 --> 00:52:13,301
It had nothing to do with you.
Is that what you think?

572
00:52:21,008 --> 00:52:24,111
It was you and Beth
that kept us together.

573
00:52:25,646 --> 00:52:28,582
When you girls left,
we were just...

574
00:52:30,684 --> 00:52:34,021
two lonely people
in a big, empty house.

575
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:37,758
Nobody to even pretend for.

576
00:52:39,361 --> 00:52:43,798
Your mom got a second chance,
Haley, and she deserves to be happy.

577
00:52:44,598 --> 00:52:45,933
So do you.

578
00:52:47,701 --> 00:52:49,937
I don't think I deserve one.

579
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,208
I miss you.

580
00:52:55,242 --> 00:52:58,212
I miss seeing your face
in the stands when I win.

581
00:52:58,979 --> 00:53:00,549
Why don't you come
anymore?

582
00:53:00,681 --> 00:53:03,617
- I thought you were mad at me.
- I am!

583
00:53:04,419 --> 00:53:05,820
I know.

584
00:53:25,206 --> 00:53:29,110
We are gonna beat
these pea-brained lizard shits.

585
00:53:29,643 --> 00:53:31,112
You and me.

586
00:53:32,947 --> 00:53:35,950
They didn't like it
when I was banging on the pipes.

587
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:38,819
I think I can distract them
if you can dive

588
00:53:38,953 --> 00:53:41,590
all the way under
until you get to the stairs.

589
00:53:41,722 --> 00:53:43,691
Yeah, I can do it.

590
00:53:45,092 --> 00:53:46,528
You ready?

591
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,895
Yeah.

592
00:53:48,597 --> 00:53:50,532
I'm coming back for you, okay?

593
00:53:50,664 --> 00:53:52,233
You'd better.

594
00:53:54,668 --> 00:53:55,903
[Dave]
Okay.

595
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:28,002
Okay.

I can't make it to the stairs.

607
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:18,640
I'm going for the drainpipe,
okay?

608
00:57:19,006 --> 00:57:20,240
[Dave] No.

609
00:57:20,908 --> 00:57:22,410
It's too dangerous.
