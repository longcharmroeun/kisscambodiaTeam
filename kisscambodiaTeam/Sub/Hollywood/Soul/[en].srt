00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:34,414
And also quickly. And quietly as well.

Mm. Trusty old brown

00:50:45,717 --> 00:50:47,802
It's a little tight in
the back-here part.

Oh, yeah? What happened?

I was existing as a theoretical construct

got to mentor number 266,

I was seriously asking, like,
what is all the fuss about?

I just thought you went to music school.

22: (MUFFLED) And another thing,
they say you're born to do something,

1191
00:53:51,873 --> 00:53:53,416
but how do you figure
out what that thing is?

1192
00:53:53,499 --> 00:53:55,502
I mean, what if you
pick up the wrong thing?

I'll take one of those.

I wouldn't call myself stuck,

1197
00:54:02,093 --> 00:54:04,136
but I never planned on
cuttin' heads for a livin'.

1198

Wait, but you were born
to be a barber, weren't you?

I wanted to be a veterinarian.

22: So, why didn't you do that?

1201
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:13,449
I was plannin' to when
I got out of the Navy.

1202
00:54:13,533 --> 00:54:15,368
Then my daughter got sick,

1203
00:54:15,451 --> 00:54:16,911
(CHUCKLES) and barber
school is a lot cheaper

1204
00:54:16,995 --> 00:54:17,996
than veterinarian school.

1205
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:19,122
22: Well, that's too bad.

1206
00:54:19,205 --> 00:54:21,040
You're stuck as a barber
and now you're unhappy.

00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:22,917
Whoa, whoa, slow your roll there, Joe.

I'm happy as a clam, my man.

I wonder why sitting in this chair
makes me want to tell you things, Dez.

That's the magic of the

I get to meet interesting folks like you,

make them happy, and make them handsome.

Wow! Am I crazy or do I look younger?

I may not have invented

Huh. How come we, um, never
talked about your life before?
