He hacks into the security system

back to the people that they stole it from.

Now, before we start,
I'd like to introduce a very special guest.

200
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,407
This company's founder and my mentor,

201
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,081
Dr. Hank Pym.

202
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,688
When I took over this company
for Dr. Pym,

203
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,001
I immediately started
researching a particle

204
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,845
that could change
the distance between atoms,

205
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,764
while increasing density and strength.

206
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,323
Why this revolutionary idea
remained buried

207
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,689
beneath the dust and cobwebs of
Hank's research, I couldn't tell you.

208
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,683
But just imagine,

209
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,004
a soldier the size of an insect.

210
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,010

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,125

Trumped-up BS to scare the USSR.

219
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,206
Hank, will you tell our guests
what you told me

220
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,807
every single time I asked you,

221
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,880
"Was the Ant-Man real?"

222
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,610
Just a tall tale.

223
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,727
Right.

224
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,883
Because how could anything
so miraculous possibly be real?

225
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,927
Well, I was inspired by the legend
of the Ant-Man.

226
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,844
And with my breakthrough
shrinking inorganic material,

227
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,969
I thought, could it be possible
to shrink a person?

228
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,444
Could that be done?

229
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,251
Well, it's not a legend anymore.

You know, I've been thinking a lot

00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,247
And today,
during my morning meditation,

369
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,244
an interesting thought occurred to me,
and I think it might apply to you, too.

Gratitude can be forgiveness.

I've spent years carrying around
my anger for Hank Pym.

You didn't even have a choice.

377
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,047
He never believed in you.

378
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,682
It's a shame what we had to do,
but he forced us to do it, didn't he?

379
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,084
But we shouldn't be angry,
we should be grateful.

380
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,730
Because his failures as a mentor,

381
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,928
as a father,

382
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,603

I was at a wine tasting
with my cousin Ernesto.

Which was mainly reds,
and you know I don't like reds, man.

But there was a rosé that saved the day.
It was delightful.

399
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,766
And then he tells me about this girl,
Emily, that we used to kick it with.

It was actually the first pair of boobs

402
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,171
It has nothing to do with the story.

403
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,281

who's a shot caller from across the bay.

406
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,323
And she tells him about the dude
that she's cleaning for.

407
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,767
Right? That he's like this big-shot CEO

408
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,922
That is all retired now, but he's loaded.

sitting in the basement, just chilling."

But before he was a big deal,
he was my assistant.

The son I never had, perhaps.

but as we became close,

he began to suspect
that I wasn't telling him everything.

727

He heard rumors about
what was called the Pym Particle,

728
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,049
and he became obsessed
with recreating my formula.

729
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,607
But I wouldn't help him.

730
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,526
So he conspired against me and
he voted me out of my own company.

731
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,125
How could he do that?

732
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,010
The board's chairman
is my daughter, Hope.

733

She was the deciding vote.

734

But she came back to me

735
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,448
when she saw how close
Cross was to cracking my formula.

736

The process is highly volatile.

the most stable guy to begin with.

This is not some cute technology
like the Iron Man suit.

777

This could change the texture of reality.

Ants, they can do a lot of things,
but they still need a leader.

In the right hands,

821
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,848
the relationship between man and suit
is symbiotic.

822
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,686
The suit has power.
The man harnesses that power.

823
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,604
You need to be skillful, agile,
and above all,

824

you need to be fast.

What does that mean?

861

It means that you would enter a reality
where all concepts of time and space

It's a pretty name.

That's how it works.

Think about Cassie.

969
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,165
About how badly you want to see her.
And use that to focus.

970

Open your eyes

971
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,127
and just think about
what you want the ants to do.

That's good!

973
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,970
Your mother convinced me

974
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,123
to let her join me on my missions.

975
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,802
They called her the Wasp.

976
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,121
She was born to it.

977
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,728
And there's not a day that goes by

978
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:11,604
that I don't regret having said yes.

979
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,764
It was 1987.

980
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:23,043
Separatists had hijacked
a Soviet missile silo in Kursk

981
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,570
and launched an ICBM
at the United States.

982
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,169
The only way to the internal mechanics

983
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,163
was through solid titanium.

984
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:54,162
I knew I had to shrink between
the molecules to disarm the missile.

985
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,483
But my regulator had sustained
too much damage.

986
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,645
Your mother,

987
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,085
she didn't hesitate.

988
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,844
Janet! No!

989
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,080
She turned off her regulator

990
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,569
and went subatomic

991
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,168
to deactivate the bomb.

992
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,769
And she was gone.

993
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,328
Your mom died a hero.

994
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,321
And I spent the next 10 years

995
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:40,764

about the quantum realm.

996
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,448
You were trying to bring her back.

997
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:51,687
But all I learned was we know nothing.

998
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,523
It's not your fault.

999
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,364
She made her choice.

01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:46,802
who is the new Ant-Man?

1365
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:49,326
Who is the man that my beloved mentor

1367
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,807
Scott Lang.

1368
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,610
A martyr

1369
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:01,166
who took on the system
and paid the price,

1370
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:04,847
losing his family and his only daughter
in the process.

1371
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:08,163
Exactly your kind of guy, Hank!

1372
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:13,961
He escapes his jail cell
without leaving any clue as to how.

1373
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:18,127

1374
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,448
despite having no money to his name.

1375
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:24,205
And now he brings me the Ant-Man suit.

1376
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:30,326

01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:08,931
Breathe. Focus. Keep it simple.

1663
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,650
No, no, no. No doubt, no doubt. Okay.

1664
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:13,127
<font color="#808080">LUIS:</font> So, I'm at this art museum
with my cousin Ignacio, right?

1665
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:15,407
And there was this, like,
abstract expressionism exhibit.

1666
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:17,721
But you know me, I'm more
like a Neo-Cubist kind of guy, right?

1667
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:20,485
But there was this one Rothko
that was sublime, bro! Oh, my God!

1668
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:22,728
- Luis.
- Okay, sorry. Sorry.

1669
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:24,802
You know, I just get excited and stuff.

1670
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:26,848
But anyway, Ignacio tells me,

1671
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:30,561
"Yo, I met this crazy-fine writer chick
at the Spot last night. Like fine-fine.

1672
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:33,007
"Like crazy-stupid fine." And he
goes up to the bartender and goes,

1673
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:34,764
"Look at the girl I'm with.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1674
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:36,080
"She's crazy-stupid fine, right?"

1675
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:38,851
The bartender's all like,
"Yeah, crazy-stupid fine."

1676
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:40,843
So this writer chick tells Ignacio,

1677
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:43,730
"Yo, I'm like a boss
in the world of guerrilla journalism,

1678
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:45,529
"and I got mad connects
with the peeps behind the curtains,

1679
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:46,567
"you know what I'm saying?"

1680
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:48,165
Ignacio's like, "For real?"

1681
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:51,210
And she's like, "Yeah, you know what,
I can't tell you who my contact is,

1682
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:52,645
"because he works with the Avengers."

1683
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:54,046
Oh, no.

1684
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:56,521
Yeah, and this dude sounds
like a badass, man.

1685
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:57,761
Like, he comes up to her and says,

1686
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:59,888
"Yo, I'm looking for this dude
who's new on the scene,

1687
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:01,086
"who's flashing his fresh tack,

1688
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:03,731
"who's got, like, bomb moves, right?
Who you got?"

1689
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:06,929
And she's like, "Well, we got everything
nowadays. We got a guy who jumps.

1690
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,082
"We got a guy who swings,
we got a guy who crawls up the walls.

1691
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:10,889
"You gotta be more specific."

1692
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:12,803
And he's like,
"I'm looking for a guy that shrinks."

1693
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:16,327
And I'm, like, "Damn!" I got all nervous
'cause I'd keep mad secrets for you, bro.

1694
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:17,447
So I asked Ignacio,

1695
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:19,568
"Did the badass tell
the stupid-fine writer chick

1696
01:47:19,640 --> 01:47:21,881
"to tell you to tell me,
because I'm tight with Ant-Man,

1697
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:23,200
"that he's looking for him?"

1698
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,411
<font color="#808080">SCOTT:</font> And? What'd he say?

1699
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:31,125
<font color="#808080">LUIS:</font> He said, "Yes."

1700
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:28,487
<font color="#808080">HANK:</font> There's something I want to show you.

1701
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:33,968
I realized you can't destroy power.

1702
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:39,565
All you can do is make sure
that it's in the right hands.

1703
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:48,408
This is an advanced prototype

1704
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:51,370
that your mother and I
worked on together.

1705
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:55,491
She never got to use it.

1706
01:49:56,120 --> 01:50:00,523
But now I realize that we were...
We were working on it for you.

1707
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:09,686
Maybe it's time we finished it.

1708
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:18,721
<font color="#808080">HOPE:</font> It's about damn time.

1709
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:20,451
<font color="#808080">FALCON:</font> Hey, Cap!

1710
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:37,167
This would have been a lot easier
a week ago.

1711
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:39,163
- If we call Tony...
- He won't believe us.

1712
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:40,241
<font color="#808080">ROGERS:</font> Even if he did...

1713
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:42,049
<font color="#808080">FALCONE:</font> Who knows if the Accords
will let him help.

1714
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:45,125
<font color="#808080">ROGERS:</font> We're on our own.

1715
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:47,851
<font color="#808080">FALCONE:</font> Maybe not.

1716
01:56:50,120 --> 01:56:51,565
I know a guy.

1717
01:56:52,566 --> 01:57:00,730
