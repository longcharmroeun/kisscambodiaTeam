1
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:59,708
<i>Scientists can tell us
many things about space.</i>

2
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,208
<i>They can tell us
how far away the stars are.</i>

3
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:10,166
<i>They can tell us that space starts
100 kilometers above the Earth.</i>

4
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:16,041
<i>But they can't tell us
about the space dog!</i>

5
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:24,666
<i>He likes to chase comets
and roll in the stardust!</i>

6
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,708
<i>As far as the space dog's concerned,
the moon is just a big, tempting ball.</i>

7
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:36,333
<i>And almost every night, he takes a bite.</i>

8
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,541
And that's the real reason
the moon has phases.

9
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:52,916
So, when the moon is big and round,

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,708
that's when the space dog
doesn't take a bite?

11
00:01:55,791 --> 00:02:00,708
That's when the Moon Goddess Chang'e
makes him spit it out.

12
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,375
Blech!

13
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,166
All right, does anyone want to hear
the scientific explanation?

14
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,083
Sorry, Ba Ba,
I like the Mommy explanation best!

15
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,416
Outnumbered!

16
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,875
- Tell me about Chang'e.
- Again?

17
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:20,416
Again! Again!
I love to hear about the Moon Goddess.

18
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,875

Why?

31

If your mother says she's real,
then she is absolutely real.

Thank you.

He's making a potion.

I can see him.

Slow down, little astronaut.
You have space brakes, you can use them.

- Cool your jets.
- Watch out, Ma Ma, Ba Ba!

How about
you help us make Mooncakes today?

49
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,333
I can?

50
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:31,416
I think it's about time you learn
how we make our special family Mooncakes.

111

Check.

112
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,583
All right.

113
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:14,583
Hey, we got company tonight,
so don't be late. Okay?

00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:27,958

119
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:53,708
Your scrumptious Mooncakes,
fresh for tonight!

120
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:54,791
We'll take four.

121
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,041
Four?

122
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,875
- Why not 16?
- Whoa.

123
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:02,208
Well, you fellas must get pretty hungry
building the fastest train in the world!

124
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,250
You know about the Maglev?

125
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,958
I heard about it in school.
It doesn't even bother with wheels.

126
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:11,333
Floats on electromagnetic fields
like a cushion of air.

127
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,708
Whoosh!

128
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:16,166
Magnetic levitation is the coolest!

129
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,333
Huh. Did you know that's how it works?

130
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,416
Mm-hmm.

131
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:22,666
Mm-mm.

132
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,750
Whoa.

133
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:34,541
Ba Ba, I sold all of the Mooncakes to...

134
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:40,666
Red dates? We never use dates.
That's not one of Ma Ma's recipes.

135
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,750
Well, I thought we'd try something new
in honor of our guest.

136
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,250
Fei Fei, this is Mrs. Zhong.

137
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,500
Hi, Fei Fei.

138
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:50,791
Hello.

139
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,458
- It's nice to meet...
- Oh.

140
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,541
Oh, no.

141
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,517
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

142
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,583
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. I got it. I got it.

143
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,875
Uh... Tour!

144
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:13,041
Fei Fei, how about we give
Mrs. Zhong a tour of the shop?

145
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,291
That sounds nice.

146
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:18,166
Uh... I'm sorry,
I have some homework to do.

147
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,583
Oh.

148
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,541
Well, we could work on it together later.

149
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,500
Uh, it's okay.

150
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,958
All right.

151
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,708
Can't believe I dropped that.

152
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,416
I can't believe you did, either.

153
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,875
- Thanks a lot!
- I'm kidding!

154
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,583
That's where we make the Mooncakes,
and this is where we sell them.

155
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,916
- Leapfrog!
- What?

156
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,125
- Come on. Leap over me.
- No!

157
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,875
What? Don't you know leapfrog?

158
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,000
Here, watch Croak.

159
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,333
You can't let a frog loose in here!

160
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,708
Ah!

161
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,250
Who exactly are you?

162
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,625
You just met my mom. I'm Chin.

163
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:08,166
I got fourth place,
Yanshi City Ping-Pong Club tournament.

164
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,416
Should've been third.

165
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,916
Oh, oh, oh, and by the way,
I have a super power.

166
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,375
Can you guess what it is?

167
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,875
Super annoying?

168
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,166
I have two super powers!

169
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:29,666
Look over there. What do you see?

170
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,625
A wall?

171
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:36,000
To you, it's a wall.
To me, it's just something to run through.

172
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,833
You can run through walls?

173
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,666
Wanna see?

174
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,500
Why, yes, I'd love to.

175
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,333
No barriers!

176
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,958
Ahhh!

177
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,083
Did you see that?

178
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:17,708
Almost a whole part of me
went right through that wall!

179
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:21,541
My molecules opened up.
I could feel them separate.

180
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:25,416
It's like the universe
was calling me by name.

181
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,625
Ba Ba, he ran into a wall!

182
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,916
Eight-year-old boys
have a lotta energy.

183
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,458
Give him a pass this time.

184
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,750
"This time"?

185
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,500
His mother's very... nice. Yeah?
I mean, you should talk to her.

186
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,333
- Why?
- Don't you ever get a little...

187
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,333
well, lonely?

188
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,541
No, never! Why? Do you?

189
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,750
I have you. We have each other.

190
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,166
Um...

191
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,416
Of course, sweetheart,
we're always gonna have each other.

192
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,125
Nothing can ever change that.

193
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,291
But, Fei Fei...

194
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,750
there is something important
I've been wanting to talk to you about.

195
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,458
You know how since...

196
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:16,750
Hello!

197
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,416
Anybody order 12 big, hairy crabs?

198
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,041
Move aside.
Good-lookin' is gonna start cookin'.

199
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,833
Hi, Aunties.

200
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,000
Oh, Fei Fei, you've gotten so big!

201
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,791
- Hi, Fei Fei!
- It's so good to see you.

202
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,041
Make way for the real cook in the family.

203
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,125
Take a look!

204
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,333
Oh, yeah, my favorite!

205
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,291
- I'm hungry!
- That sizzle!

206
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:41,583
These dumplings,
almost as good as mine.

207
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,375
Mmm! That's smelling so good!

208
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,166
- Fei Fei, take a bite of this.
- Oh.

209
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,291
- Thanks, Nai Nai!
- Coming through!

210
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,250
You're so skinny.
Hasn't anybody been feeding you?

211
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:57,291
The hairy crab is a burrowing crab,
known for its furry claws.

212
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,125
Hi, Ye Ye.

213
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:03,041
Fei Fei, perhaps we can use my red dates
for our second batch.

214
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,416
Ma Ma preferred melon seeds in the paste.

215
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,791
Oh. Well, my family uses dates
grown in our garden.

216
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,708
If you wanna try one, they're delicious.

217
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,041
- I'm probably allergic to dates.
- Oh.

218
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:16,416
Besides, we only make them
our special way here.

219
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,250
Okay.

220
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,708
Your right or my left?

221
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,375
Seems like this table gets heavier
every year, right?

222
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,000
Ooh, hot plate! Careful.

223
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:32,541
No rabbits at the table.
You remember what Ma Ma said.

224
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,208
Besides, that's <i>my</i> chair.

225
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:39,166
The table looks beautiful.
Um, where should I sit?

226
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,333
Here, sit by me.

227
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,500
- Oh, thank you.
- Of course.

228
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,750
All right.

229
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:52,666
The hairy crab invades local waters,
damaging fishing nets and native species.

230
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,958
Ah, look how big and bright the moon is!

231
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:01,208
You have a little bit of sauce
on the side of your...

232
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,625
It's gonna be huge for the Moon festival!

233
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,416
Ma Ma's favorite holiday.

234
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,500
Uh...

235
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,750
So, your father tells me
you're fond of Chang'e.

236
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:18,666
Oh, poor lady, that goddess!
So lonely up there on the moon.

237
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,041
No one but Jade Rabbit
to keep her company.

238
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,833
Oh, come on!
Chang'e loves it up there alone!

239
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:28,625
That's why she took both immortality pills
instead of saving one for Houyi!

240
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:32,125
Actually, according to my mother,
I might be related to Houyi.

241
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,875
Houyi, the Archer! <i>Cho!</i>

242
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,958
- Chin!
- Ugh!

243
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:40,583
That's not what happened, Auntie.
Houyi was off fighting demons.

244
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,875
With his bow and arrow and...

245
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:45,750
- When a robber came and tried to st...
- Steal the immortality pills?

246
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:49,416
Yeah, yeah, yeah, she only put them
both in her mouth as a hiding place.

247
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,000
Not buying it.

248
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:55,875
Chang'e floated to the sky
while her one true love stayed here.

249
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,333
And bit the dust.

250
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,541
Now she lives with a rabbit
instead of a husband.

251
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:02,625
Good choice.

252
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:06,666
But it wasn't her choice.
She didn't try to leave Houyi behind.

253
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,416
She misses Houyi
and cries for him every day!

254
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,625
And how do you know that?

255
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,208
They text.

256
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:16,208
- Don't tease Fei Fei.
- It's just a silly myth.

257
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:20,833
It's not a silly myth. It's real.
Chang'e is real!

258
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,250
- Ah... Fei Fei!
- Uh-oh!

259
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:31,208
She's on the moon right now,
waiting for her one and only true love.

260
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,750
Waiting... right, Ba Ba?

261
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,375
Uh...

262
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,833
Just give her a minute.

263
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:53,875
She's at the top of her class,
but she still believes in Chang'e?

264
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:03,500
It's you and me, Bungee.
We're the last true believers.

265
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,375
Ow!

266
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,708
Not really in the mood!

267
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:17,125
Know what I am? A bat!

268
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,875
Yeah, a dingbat!

269
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,333
I hope you like dingbats

270
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,541
because you're gonna see
a whole lot more of me.

271
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,458
Whoa!

272
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:26,916
Not if I can help it.

273
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,458
Haven't you heard?
We're gonna be brother and sister!

274
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:34,083
- What?
- My mom and your dad are getting mar...

275
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,250
Don't say it! Don't!

276
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,083
Hi, Fei Fei.

277
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,041
Hello.

278
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,666
I didn't want you to miss dessert.

279
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,791
Oh, um...

280
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:51,041
I saved you a special Mooncake
from my hometown... without dates.

281
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,125
Uh...

282
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:55,833
Thank you.

283
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,583
No barriers!

284
00:18:58,708 --> 00:18:59,541
Ugh.

285
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:05,041
Chin can be rambunctious at times.
But after a while, you get used to him.

286
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:09,125
Zhong! Get over here
before I kick everyone's butt at Mahjong.

287
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,166
Oh, yes. We'll see.

288
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:16,500
"Get used to him"?
I'll never get used to him!

289
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,125
What's so special about your Mooncake?

290
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:22,916
I don't want it, and I don't want you!

291
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,708
I just want things back the way they were.

292
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:35,916
He used to believe in Chang'e.
He said she was absolutely real.

293
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,958
But now he's changed.

294
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:44,833
If Ba Ba could only believe again,
he would never marry that woman.

295
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:49,375
He would remember everything.
He would remember you.

296
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,791
Bungee!

297
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:04,291

- Ow.

476
00:38:06,291 --> 00:38:08,583
- Improved.
- So much better!

477
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:13,041
All right, Unfortunate Hair Girl,
consider yourself welcomed.

478
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,583
You may now give me the gift.

479
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:18,916
Um, I'm sorry,
but I didn't bring you a gift.

480
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:26,916
Of course you brought me the gift.

481
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,208
Why else would I have sent my lions
to bring you here from Earth?

482
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:34,833
Those were yours?
They're so cool, and you sent them for me.

483
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:36,041
Well, of course.

484
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:39,625
You were given the one thing I need
to bring Houyi back.

485
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:42,500
Houyi?
I knew you've never given up on him.

486
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:46,041
That's what I was telling my dad!
You see, I'm in an urgent situation.

487
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:48,434
I came a long way. I built a rocket...

488
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:52,166
She's talking,
but it's not about the gift.

489
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,583
No, Goddess.

490
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:57,291
What I mean is, you're the one
who believes that love never dies.

491
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:59,208
Everybody knows that about you.

492
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:04,375
My dad used to believe that, too,
but now I'm afraid he's giving up.

493
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:07,625
If I could just have a photo
to prove to my dad that you're real...

494
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:10,833
Pictures! She wants pictures.

495
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:15,083
Everybody wants pictures.
Does this look like a photo op to you?

496
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:18,833
Um, yes?

497
00:39:18,916 --> 00:39:20,083
Then do it fast.

498
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:32,541
Uh-uh. No gift, no photo.

499
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:36,541
But I don't know what it is.
You can have anything of mine you want...

500
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:42,458
I don't want "anything." I want the gift!

501
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:48,250
Chin!

502
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:52,416
Clearly, you've lost my gift.

503
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:59,833
I sense it's on my moon somewhere,
and I suggest you go find it!

504
00:40:00,458 --> 00:40:02,166
Let's stop playing games.

505
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:05,875
There's only a sliver of moon left.

506
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:09,708
When the last moon dust falls,
it will be too late to bring Houyi back.

507
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,791
Lunarians, I announce a competition.

508
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:19,541
Anyone who finds and brings me the gift
will get their wish granted.

509
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:23,125
If you bring it to me first,
you'll get your photo.

510
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,416
Good luck and Godspeed!

511
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,708
Find it!

512
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:31,791
- Come on!
- Out of the way!

513
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,583
She'll get me that gift.

514
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:39,958
And, Jade, your potion is the final piece
we need to bring Houyi back.

515
00:40:40,041 --> 00:40:42,583
And you will be ready, won't you?

516
00:40:45,583 --> 00:40:48,458
Let me through, please!

517
00:40:53,875 --> 00:40:57,208
Hey, can I get a... ride?

518
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:01,666
The gift...
It has to be at the crash site!

519
00:41:02,416 --> 00:41:03,416
What could it be?

520
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,041
Wait up! We'll help you find it.

521
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:08,708
- I don't want your help.
- First, we find the gift, then...

522
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:10,500
I said I don't want your help.

523
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:12,809
- But I just wanted...
- I never wanted you on this trip!

524
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:15,541
I never even wanted you in my life!!

525
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:18,833
You can't talk to your brother like that.

526
00:41:18,916 --> 00:41:20,541
You're not my brother.

527
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:22,333
But I could become your brother.

528
00:41:22,416 --> 00:41:24,666
You will never be my brother!

529
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Bungee!

530
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:36,375
I don't have time for this.

531
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:41,291
Will anybody help me? Argh!

532
00:41:57,416 --> 00:41:59,458
Whoa! Whoa...

533
00:42:03,541 --> 00:42:04,916
Could I get a ride?

534
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,708
Biker chicks only.

535
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,583
Wait! I know where the gift is.

536
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:15,416
Well, all right.

537
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,291
Follow the leader!

538
00:42:17,958 --> 00:42:18,958
Okay.

539
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,291
I'd be a great brother.

540
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:32,041
Hut! Hut!
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!

541
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:36,708
I just have to get that photo!

542
00:42:36,791 --> 00:42:38,208
Come on, Bungee.

543
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:45,708
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!

544
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:50,708
You take that one, and I'll take the rest.

545
00:42:50,791 --> 00:42:52,708
Easy peasy.

546
00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:57,208
Whoa, whoa...

547
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:02,833
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

548
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,375
Whoa!

549
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,416
What are these things? Ow!

550
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,875
Palace Security.

551
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:23,375
- Hut! Hut! Hut!
- Whoa.

552
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,083
What are you doing here?

553
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:29,166
I want the photo for my sister!

554
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:31,500
Well, I want the gift.

555
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:33,250
Well, I know where it is.

556
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:34,708
Oh, you do?

557
00:43:34,791 --> 00:43:36,791
Bring him to the interrogation chamber.

558
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:43,666
Uh, is she taking me in there?
Because I won't go.

559
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,458
I won't, I won't!

560
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:51,125
I'm in!

561
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:53,708
Whoo!

562
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:05,750
How about a game? Do you like games?

563
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:07,833
You know it.

564
00:44:09,041 --> 00:44:12,541
Tell you what.
If you win, I'll give you this photo.

565
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:16,000
But if I win,
you tell me where the gift is.

566
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:17,791
Deal!

567
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:20,916
We'll play by Lunaria rules.

568
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,666
Whoa!

569
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:28,666
Whoa...

570
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,083
Whoa.

You're a 3,000-year-old lady
who ate both immortality pills!

607
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:11,291
Now you live alone forever!

608
00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:26,916
I win!

609
00:46:28,166 --> 00:46:30,375
Ugh!

610
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:35,916
No one's leaving until I get that gift.

611
00:46:38,083 --> 00:46:40,500
Hey! What about the photo?

612
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:47,125
That little ping-pong poo is no use,
and we're running out of time.

613
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:48,208
Aw.

614
00:46:48,291 --> 00:46:50,666
This is our only chance.

615
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:52,708
Please try to stay calm.

616
00:46:52,791 --> 00:46:55,458
You don't want to cause
another meteor shower.

617
00:46:55,541 --> 00:46:57,041
Do yoga with us.

618
00:46:57,125 --> 00:46:59,083
Calming breath in...

619
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:03,083
And calming breath out...

620
00:47:03,166 --> 00:47:04,625
Oh! Whoa, boy!

621
00:47:05,208 --> 00:47:06,916
I'm calm.

622
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,583
I'm calm.

623
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:09,541
Uh-oh.

624
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:12,875
I'm calm!

625
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,416
Oh, Goddess.

626
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:25,583
I'm so calm.

627
00:47:26,291 --> 00:47:31,458
I know the gift is somewhere near.
I can feel it!

628
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:36,000
Hi, Jade.

629
00:47:37,416 --> 00:47:40,291
Well, at least the potion is working.

630
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:49,541
I'll never see Houyi again, will I?

631
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:21,125
Looks like the Moon Goddess
is astronomically upset.

632
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:24,500
When she's mad,
this road's a suicide mission.

633
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:26,208
Yeah, let's wait it out.

634
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:28,416
No! We're going! Follow me!

635
00:48:35,125 --> 00:48:36,416
Go left!

636
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,500
Whoa!

637
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:42,125
Right!

638
00:48:44,958 --> 00:48:47,375
Okay, now left!

639
00:48:49,875 --> 00:48:52,083
We've gotta get through that canyon!

640
00:48:55,708 --> 00:48:57,791
Whoa! We're not gonna make it!

641
00:48:57,875 --> 00:49:00,500
Don't be such a chicken.

642
00:49:14,375 --> 00:49:16,125
Let's get that gift.

643
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:21,708
No barriers!

644
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:23,750
Ahhh!

645
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:39,916
There it is!
Over there! My rocket ship!

646
00:49:43,958 --> 00:49:46,541
Oh, my rocket ship...

647
00:49:46,625 --> 00:49:47,916
What a mess.

648
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,750
What's this gift
look like anyway?

649
00:49:55,833 --> 00:49:59,000
I'm not sure.
Let's just spread out. We'll find it.

650
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:05,541
Huh?

651
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:17,666
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

652
00:50:18,666 --> 00:50:21,125
Hi, I'm Gobi. What's your name?

653
00:50:21,208 --> 00:50:24,041
- Uh, I'm Fei Fei.
- I'm Gobi. What's your name?

654
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:28,333
I feel like we're talking in a circle.
I actually used to be a nervous talker.

655
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:29,875
I think that's what's great about me

656
00:50:29,958 --> 00:50:32,125
is that I'm so self-aware
about my nervous talking.

657
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:35,541
So I gotta slow it down, relax,
and just breathe.

658
00:50:35,625 --> 00:50:37,375
Checking my pulse right now.

659
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:40,041
Ah, serenity achieved.

660
00:50:40,125 --> 00:50:43,208
Who are you? What are you?

661
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:46,416
I happen to be
Chang'e's most trusted advisor.

662
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:50,000
Very high level member of the court.
I mean, not like a court jester,

663
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:53,041
but definitely a member of the court,
like, really high up.

664
00:50:53,125 --> 00:50:54,541
I'm basically indispensable.

665
00:50:54,625 --> 00:50:56,833
Then what are you doing
all the way out here?

666
00:50:56,916 --> 00:50:58,583
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!
- Wait.

667
00:50:58,666 --> 00:51:02,875
Is that <i>the</i> lunar rover?
With my parachute?

668
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:03,958
I don't know.

669
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:09,208
Oh, you can take my cape,
but I'm keeping these sweet moon pants.

670
00:51:09,291 --> 00:51:10,166
Dig it!

671
00:51:11,458 --> 00:51:13,333
- What's he doing here?
- What?

672
00:51:13,416 --> 00:51:15,625
I wouldn't be talking to that one
if I were you.

673
00:51:15,708 --> 00:51:19,083
Yeah, he was kicked out of the palace
by the Goddess.

674
00:51:19,166 --> 00:51:21,125
- Hey, easy!
- Don't listen to them.

675
00:51:21,208 --> 00:51:24,666
These Lunarian chickens,
they got a little scrambled up,

676
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,041
it's... it's fine.

677
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:28,125
It is not fine.
They are bad eggs.

678
00:51:28,208 --> 00:51:29,833
Uh-uh! Look who's talking!

679
00:51:29,916 --> 00:51:32,750
- Yeah, you little green glow worm!
- Ow.

680
00:51:32,833 --> 00:51:34,291
Hey!

681
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:37,500
Quit wasting time.
We have to find the gift for Chang'e.

682
00:51:37,583 --> 00:51:40,208
Chang'e! Oh, I wanna help.
Can I help? I'd love to help.

683
00:51:40,291 --> 00:51:41,458
Did I mention I can help?

684
00:51:41,541 --> 00:51:43,625
- Oh!
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

685
00:51:44,916 --> 00:51:46,791
Who do I look like? Who do I look like?

686
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:50,750
<i>♪ Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Egg-straordinaria! ♪</i>

687
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:52,458
Argh!

688
00:52:05,875 --> 00:52:07,625
My Chang'e doll.

689
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:11,750
Oh, yeah, she's amazing. I can't help
but break into song when I see her.

690
00:52:11,833 --> 00:52:16,375
A gift my Ma Ma gave me. This must be it!

691
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:18,958
Yeah, must be.

692
00:52:19,958 --> 00:52:21,291
- Thank you!
- Hey, wait!

693
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,583
- Sorry, newbie.
- Whoa, whoa!

694
00:52:23,666 --> 00:52:25,916
- I'm sorry!
- Give it back!

695
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Hey! Watch it!

696
00:52:28,083 --> 00:52:30,708
That's enough out of you.

697
00:52:30,791 --> 00:52:31,916
Ew.

698
00:52:35,166 --> 00:52:38,166
No! That's mine! Come back!

699
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:42,000
Whoever gets it to the Goddess
first gets their wish granted!

700
00:52:42,083 --> 00:52:44,000
You can't leave me here!

701
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:50,916
I'm gonna get that gift.

702
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:54,416
- And bring it to Lunaria!
- Lunaria?

703
00:52:55,208 --> 00:52:56,833
But you'll need a guide! And guess what?

704
00:52:56,916 --> 00:53:00,291
This guy used to both work
and live in the palace.

705
00:53:02,666 --> 00:53:06,041
As soon as I get that gift back,
I'm taking it to Chang'e.

706
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:09,208
Oh, oh, oh, please let me help you
bring a gift to the Goddess!

707
00:53:09,291 --> 00:53:10,541
- No.
- Please?

708
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:11,708
- No.
- Please?

709
00:53:11,791 --> 00:53:17,708
- No.
- Plea...

710
00:53:17,791 --> 00:53:20,041
- No!
- Let me finish.

711
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,875
Okay, okay!
Just stop making that noise.

712
00:53:27,666 --> 00:53:30,666
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!

713
00:54:25,875 --> 00:54:26,916
Ow.

714
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:13,708
But my whole point is
I'm a nervous talker,

715
00:55:13,791 --> 00:55:15,166
and I'm starting to work on that.

716
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:18,375
I realized, "Wow. Am I talking fast?"
I thought, "You should relax."

717
00:55:18,458 --> 00:55:21,333
So I've been working on slowing it down
and breathing and...

718
00:55:21,416 --> 00:55:22,500
Uh-oh.

719
00:55:26,541 --> 00:55:29,458
Sometimes it causes me
to get a little tongue-tied.

720
00:55:29,541 --> 00:55:32,291
I hate it when this happens.

721
00:55:41,375 --> 00:55:43,125
Gobi, what's happening?

722
00:55:47,541 --> 00:55:49,291
Please tell me they're not hungry.

723
00:55:49,375 --> 00:55:51,000
They're not hungry.

724
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:52,208
I'm lying.

725
00:55:52,291 --> 00:55:55,875
They're very hungry!
I've never seen them this ravenous!

726
00:55:55,958 --> 00:55:57,333
Whoa!

727
00:55:57,416 --> 00:55:58,875
Run away!

728
00:55:58,958 --> 00:56:01,333
They're going to Lunaria Lake to feed.

729
00:56:01,416 --> 00:56:05,041
Hey, I know this game! Sorry about this.

730
00:56:11,583 --> 00:56:13,000
Whew!

731
00:56:13,083 --> 00:56:16,083
We should catch up
to those biker chicks in no time.

732
00:56:16,166 --> 00:56:18,750
Whoo! That was a bonding experience.

733
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,673
Do you feel close?
'Cause I feel closer to you.

734
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:23,916
I feel like this is amazing.
Besties forever.

735
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,083
<i>♪ Uh, forever! Uh, forever! ♪</i>

736
00:56:26,166 --> 00:56:28,166
Uh-uh-uh-uh, chicka-chicka...

737
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:29,958
Huh?

738
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:37,458
Good times, good times.

739
00:56:38,708 --> 00:56:41,750
So, why are you living by yourself?

740
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:43,208
That's a personal question.

741
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:47,833
But since you and I are like family now,
I can tell you.

742
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:50,083
It happened a long time ago.

743
00:56:50,666 --> 00:56:54,166
The Goddess exiled me from Lunaria
because of a song I sang to her.

744
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:57,083
She exiled you over a song?

745
00:56:57,166 --> 00:56:59,500
She's nothing like Ma Ma said she'd be.

746
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:03,333
Ma Ma said she was kind and gentle,

747
00:57:03,416 --> 00:57:06,500
graceful as a swan
landing on a quiet lake.

748
00:57:07,208 --> 00:57:11,166
She was all those things,
until Houyi died.

749
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:15,083
And then
she just pushed us all away.

750
00:57:16,416 --> 00:57:19,416
Once you lose the person
you love the most...

751
00:57:20,125 --> 00:57:21,291
It changes you.

752
00:57:22,166 --> 00:57:23,166
Yeah.

753
00:57:24,416 --> 00:57:28,250
After I sang that song,
the Goddess disappeared.

754
00:57:28,333 --> 00:57:31,583
All the lights in Lunaria just went out.

755
00:57:32,208 --> 00:57:34,333
We call it "The Big Darkness."

756
00:57:34,916 --> 00:57:38,125
That song, will you sing it for me?

757
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,750
Uh, I don't know.

758
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:43,958
The acoustics aren't good
when you're singing on top of a frog.

759
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:47,833

So, that's the song you sang to her?

801
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,833
No, it was another song.

802
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:28,345

Jade?

806
01:01:17,666 --> 01:01:19,750
What's going on with you?

807
01:01:22,625 --> 01:01:26,250
Oh, it worked!
You've... Oh, you've done it.

808
01:01:26,333 --> 01:01:28,333
- And just in time!
- Ooh.

809
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,166
Now I just need that gift.

810
01:01:34,833 --> 01:01:35,875
Argh!

811
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:38,583
Why did I ever let
those bikers into my life?

812
01:01:39,791 --> 01:01:41,083
There they are! Ha!

813
01:01:41,916 --> 01:01:43,458
There's my doll!

814
01:01:44,625 --> 01:01:46,125
Don't worry. I got this.

815
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:51,208
Uh-oh.

816
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,333
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa!

817
01:02:13,583 --> 01:02:15,083
Aw.

818
01:02:15,166 --> 01:02:16,666
Hey, little guys.

819
01:02:23,208 --> 01:02:24,333
Where is it?

820
01:02:51,041 --> 01:02:52,083
Argh.

821
01:03:02,708 --> 01:03:04,625
Are you nuts? It's mine!

822
01:03:04,708 --> 01:03:06,291
Give it back!

823
01:03:09,541 --> 01:03:11,333
Get your grubby mitts off it!

824
01:03:24,291 --> 01:03:26,083
No!

825
01:03:27,416 --> 01:03:29,166
Guess there's no gift now.

826
01:03:34,791 --> 01:03:37,791
Fei Fei?
You can come out, they're gone now.

827
01:03:38,958 --> 01:03:42,625
Come out, Fei Fei. I'll do anything
to make you okay, anything!

828
01:03:42,708 --> 01:03:44,083
What do I have to do?

829
01:03:44,708 --> 01:03:45,750
Look up.

830
01:04:00,041 --> 01:04:01,625
Oh, no!

831
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:10,541
I've lost everything now.

832
01:04:10,625 --> 01:04:12,125
Not everything.

833
01:04:12,208 --> 01:04:15,125
You still have this, and this, and...

834
01:04:17,416 --> 01:04:18,458
this!

835
01:04:19,166 --> 01:04:21,250
And you're alive. That's a plus.

836
01:04:21,333 --> 01:04:27,291
That gift was my only chance
to stop my father from getting remarried.

837
01:04:27,375 --> 01:04:28,833
"Remarried"?

838
01:04:28,916 --> 01:04:33,875
Your mother is... I mean, is she... gone?

839
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:40,541
Now I'm stuck here. The gift is gone,

840
01:04:40,625 --> 01:04:45,666
and my dad will marry
that awful woman with her horrible boy!

841
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:47,291
What horrible boy?

842
01:04:47,375 --> 01:04:49,750
A ridiculously annoying boy.

843
01:04:49,833 --> 01:04:53,541
Nobody likes annoying creatures.
They are the worst!

844
01:04:53,625 --> 01:04:55,375
- He's always making faces.
- Ugh!

845
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:57,750
He plays leapfrog all the time.

846
01:04:57,833 --> 01:05:01,041
He thinks he can hang upside down
like a bat and run through walls.

847
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:03,392
- And he's always interrupting me!
- Let me finish.

848
01:05:03,416 --> 01:05:04,750
He plays leapfrog?

849
01:05:06,541 --> 01:05:09,500
Is that where you got the idea
for us to ride on those frogs?

850
01:05:09,583 --> 01:05:11,708
No! I mean, not really.

851
01:05:11,791 --> 01:05:15,166
And he hangs upside down like a bat,
like you did when you almost got scorched?

852
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,791
Is that where you got that idea?

853
01:05:17,375 --> 01:05:19,000
No!

854
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:21,041
Anyway, I can't stand him.

855
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:22,916
I can't stand him either.

856
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:27,500
- Did you say he can run through walls?
- Forget it, all right?

857
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I would love to have a brother.

858
01:05:31,791 --> 01:05:34,916
You know, but then again,
I've been alone for a thousand years.

859
01:05:35,958 --> 01:05:37,541
How many years have you been alone?

860
01:05:38,291 --> 01:05:39,500
Four.

861
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:42,958
Well, give it time.
You might change your mind.

862
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:50,250
I think Ms. Grumpy-Pants is hungry. Hmm?

863
01:05:50,333 --> 01:05:51,500
Why don't we eat something?

864
01:05:51,583 --> 01:05:53,791
Everything looks better
when your tummy's full.

865
01:05:53,875 --> 01:05:56,625
Ooh, there's a tasty map right here.

866
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:00,375
Mmm! Delicious. Have some map.

867
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:03,750
- Mmm.
- Blech!

868
01:06:03,833 --> 01:06:07,083
I can't believe you eat Mooncakes.
That's barbaric.

869
01:06:07,166 --> 01:06:09,583
These Mooncakes don't have feelings.

870
01:06:10,208 --> 01:06:11,416
Ow!

871
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:16,166
What's this?
Looks like the broken half of something.

872
01:06:16,791 --> 01:06:18,708
Chin probably found it somewhere

873
01:06:18,791 --> 01:06:21,500
and thought it would be funny
to bake it into a Mooncake.

874
01:06:21,583 --> 01:06:23,250
I told you he was annoying.

875
01:06:23,333 --> 01:06:26,458
Wait a minute.
Why does this look familiar?

876
01:06:29,708 --> 01:06:31,458
Nope, never seen it.

877
01:06:31,541 --> 01:06:34,291
This half forms a whole with that symbol.

878
01:06:37,458 --> 01:06:40,666
This amulet, Gobi! It's the gift!

879
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,875
There's still a chance.

880
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:48,541
We've gotta get this to Chang'e!

881
01:06:48,625 --> 01:06:50,000
- Come on!
- Aah!

882
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:53,958
We need to help Fei Fei.

883
01:06:54,666 --> 01:06:56,833
No barriers!

884
01:06:56,916 --> 01:06:58,791
Ahhh!

885
01:07:01,291 --> 01:07:02,458
I did it!

886
01:07:04,291 --> 01:07:08,041
Bungee? Maybe we did it.

887
01:07:09,958 --> 01:07:11,101
If she's coming with the gift,

888
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:12,750
it has to be now.

889
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:22,291
Got ya!

890
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:27,000
Chin?

891
01:07:27,083 --> 01:07:29,833
Fei Fei!
Oh, my gosh, I'm so happy to see you!

892
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:31,541
- You're okay!
- It was so crazy!

893
01:07:31,625 --> 01:07:34,083
The poles were all moving,
and then I was surrounded...

894
01:07:34,166 --> 01:07:36,333
Look. We got the gift.

895
01:07:36,416 --> 01:07:37,541
Wow!

896
01:07:37,625 --> 01:07:39,125
Hi, I'm Gobi.

897
01:07:39,208 --> 01:07:40,708
Rad. I'm Chin.

898
01:07:40,791 --> 01:07:43,916
Double rad, I just returned
from a thousand years in exile.

899
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,875
I wonder if I'll run into anyone I know...

900
01:07:46,583 --> 01:07:48,083
Gobi!

901
01:07:48,166 --> 01:07:50,416
The amulet!

902
01:07:52,083 --> 01:07:53,500
Fei Fei, get it!

903
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:57,541
No, no. Leave me be.

904
01:07:57,625 --> 01:07:59,291
We're almost out of time!

905
01:08:00,125 --> 01:08:02,625
- Oh, thank you.
- Hurry, come this way.

906
01:08:03,625 --> 01:08:04,958
Goddess, it's here!

907
01:08:05,041 --> 01:08:06,541
Fei Fei.

908
01:08:09,083 --> 01:08:13,333
I think
this is the gift you're looking for.

909
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,541
Of course, the other half of the amulet.

910
01:08:27,666 --> 01:08:30,666
Our two halves can make us whole again.

911
01:08:33,416 --> 01:08:36,041
Now you can come back to me.

922

Chang'e, I cannot stay.
You have to move on.

923
01:10:46,125 --> 01:10:47,125
But how?

924
01:10:51,333 --> 01:10:52,583
No!

925
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:56,166
Our love is forever.

926
01:10:56,250 --> 01:11:00,208
Please don't leave me again. Houyi!

927
01:11:02,375 --> 01:11:03,875
Oh, no...

928
01:11:17,166 --> 01:11:18,708
It's the darkness!

929
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,500
Oh, no.

930
01:11:38,416 --> 01:11:41,125
What is this place?

931
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:44,250
The Chamber of Exquisite Sadness.

932
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:46,166
It's impenetrable.

933
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:49,333
Only the Goddess
has ever gone in there.

934
01:11:50,041 --> 01:11:51,166
Let me try.

935
01:11:53,666 --> 01:11:55,666
I told you, you can't go in...

936
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:58,226
- How did you do that?
- No, no!

937
01:11:58,250 --> 01:12:00,250
If you go in there,
you may never come out again.

938
01:12:00,333 --> 01:12:02,416
You may never go home again.

939
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:12,541
Fei Fei!

940
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:26,000
Chang'e?

941
01:12:27,333 --> 01:12:29,833
It's me... Fei Fei?

942
01:12:31,416 --> 01:12:33,000
Bad Haircut Girl.

943
01:12:37,458 --> 01:12:38,833
I'm here to bring you back.

944
01:12:49,708 --> 01:12:50,583
Mom?

945
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:53,333
- Fei Fei.
- Ma Ma!

946
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:21,666
Over here! Fei Fei! This way!

947
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:25,291
I was afraid of this.
She's stuck now.

948
01:13:35,416 --> 01:13:36,875
No!

949
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,541
Bungee!

950
01:13:41,833 --> 01:13:44,500
Fei Fei!

951
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:49,750
What are you doing here?

952
01:13:50,708 --> 01:13:51,958
You don't belong here.

You can't stay here.

You'll only end up lonely
for all eternity, like me.

956
01:14:01,666 --> 01:14:03,250

Am I still a dingbat?

Yes, but you're my dingbat.

984
01:16:29,958 --> 01:16:31,666

Fei Fei! Fei Fei!

1002
01:18:20,208 --> 01:18:22,250
Remember when we chased
those mean chickens?

1003
01:18:22,333 --> 01:18:23,916
Yeah, they were mean!

1004
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,958
Remember when you lassoed
a frog with my tongue?

1005
01:18:27,041 --> 01:18:28,791
Remember when we said goodbye?

1006
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:31,291
You mean, like, right now?

1007
01:18:31,375 --> 01:18:32,375
Yes.

1008
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,666
Goodbye, Fei Fei.

1009
01:18:44,708 --> 01:18:47,833
If you wanna stay, you can.

1010
01:18:50,041 --> 01:18:51,458
I'll be okay.

1011
01:18:54,791 --> 01:18:56,916
You have a new life now.

1012
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:00,250
Go.

1013
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:07,583
Goodbye, Bungee.

1014
01:19:16,208 --> 01:19:18,375
Thank you
for bringing me the gift, Fei Fei.

1015
01:19:21,291 --> 01:19:23,708
I wish it had given you
everything you wanted.

1016
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:25,500
It did.

1017
01:19:26,416 --> 01:19:27,875
The real gift was you.

1018
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:50,000
Bye, Fei Fei! Besties forever!

1019
01:19:50,083 --> 01:19:52,416
Forever! Forever!

1020
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:53,833
Bye-bye!

1021
01:19:53,916 --> 01:19:57,333
Forever! Chicka-chicka!
Forever! Chicka-chicka! Forever!

1022
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,083
I'm starving.

1023
01:21:58,166 --> 01:21:59,708
...way too many cooks in here.

1024
01:22:03,625 --> 01:22:05,416
Hi, Fei Fei.

1025
01:22:07,291 --> 01:22:09,333
Out of the way, Space Dog!

1026
01:22:12,833 --> 01:22:17,875
Eating hairy crabs has been called
a life-changing experience.

1027
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:19,875
It smells so good!

1028
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:21,333
Really?

1029
01:22:21,416 --> 01:22:24,791
- Zhong <i>Ayi,</i> can I help you with that?
- Oh, of course.

1030
01:22:25,541 --> 01:22:29,375
You know, the Moon festival
is my favorite night of the year.

1031
01:22:29,458 --> 01:22:31,166
My Nai Nai always told me

1032
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:35,875
the circle of a Mooncake
is the symbol of a family coming together.

1033
01:22:35,958 --> 01:22:36,958
Hmm?

1034
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:47,500
- Fei Fei, sit here.
- Come, sit by us.

1035
01:22:50,416 --> 01:22:51,625
- Chin.
- Chin!

1036
01:22:51,708 --> 01:22:54,416
Get that frog off the chair.

1037
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,041
Sorry.

1038
01:22:56,125 --> 01:22:57,666
Be careful. If he does that again,

1039
01:22:57,750 --> 01:23:00,708
he may end up
as your sister's next science experiment.

1040
01:23:00,791 --> 01:23:02,083
Don't tell him that.

1041
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:07,333
It's the Moon festival, and no moon!

1042
01:23:07,416 --> 01:23:10,791
Chang'e must be so sad,
hidden behind those clouds,

1043
01:23:10,875 --> 01:23:13,041
dreaming of her one true love.

1044
01:23:13,125 --> 01:23:15,708
Come on,
don't start that again!

1045
01:23:15,791 --> 01:23:17,875
Start what? It's romantic.

1046
01:23:31,291 --> 01:23:33,750
No playing with your food at the table.

1047
01:23:35,125 --> 01:23:36,500
Are you gonna eat that?

1048
01:23:36,583 --> 01:23:38,333
Not now, we're talking about Chang'e!

1049
01:23:50,375 --> 01:23:53,250
Looks like the moon
has decided to come out for us after all.

1050
01:23:55,333 --> 01:23:57,750
What do you think
Jade Rabbit's making tonight?

1051
01:23:59,666 --> 01:24:01,500
Moonmush!

1052
01:24:04,541 --> 01:24:06,583
You laugh just like your Ma Ma.

1053
01:24:07,333 --> 01:24:08,666
I know, Ba Ba.

1054
01:24:10,583 --> 01:24:11,708
Should we head back?

1055
01:24:12,666 --> 01:24:13,875
I'll be right there.

1056
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:32,166
- Ha-ha-ha!
- All right, you dingbat!

1057
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:35,583
Mom! Fei Fei's chasing me!

1058
01:25:35,666 --> 01:25:36,791
No, I'm not!

1059
01:25:36,875 --> 01:25:39,208
