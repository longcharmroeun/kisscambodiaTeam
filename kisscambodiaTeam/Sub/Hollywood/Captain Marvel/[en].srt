Okay. Your turn.

558
00:40:46,022 --> 00:40:47,757
Prove you're not a Skrull.

559
00:40:56,232 --> 00:40:58,934
And how is that
supposed to prove to me

560
00:40:58,935 --> 00:41:00,235
you're not a Skrull?

1079
01:12:02,565 --> 01:12:06,635
My people lived as refugees
on Torfa.

1080
01:12:06,636 --> 01:12:09,738
Homeless, ever since
we resisted Kree rule...

1081
01:12:09,739 --> 01:12:11,873
and they destroyed
our planet.

1082
01:12:11,874 --> 01:12:15,610
And the handful of us
that are left

1083
01:12:15,611 --> 01:12:17,779
will be slaughtered next...

1084
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:21,784
unless you help me finish
what Mar-Vell started.

1085
01:12:23,019 --> 01:12:24,619
The core that she found

1086
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:26,388
would have powered
a light-speed ship...

1087
01:12:26,389 --> 01:12:28,156
capable of carrying us
to safety.

1088
01:12:28,157 --> 01:12:32,328
A new home where
the Kree can't reach us.

1089
01:12:33,729 --> 01:12:36,064
Lawson always told us
that our work at Pegasus

1090
01:12:36,065 --> 01:12:37,599
wasn't to fight wars...

1091
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,100
but to end them.

1092
01:12:39,101 --> 01:12:44,740
She wanted you to help us
find the core.

1093
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:46,908
Well, I already destroyed it.

1094
01:12:46,909 --> 01:12:48,677
No, you destroyed
the engine.

1095
01:12:48,678 --> 01:12:51,813
The core that powered it
is in a remote location.

1096
01:12:51,814 --> 01:12:56,184
If you help us
decode those coordinates...

1097
01:12:56,185 --> 01:12:57,820
we can find it.

1098
01:12:59,655 --> 01:13:01,357
You'll use it
to destroy us.

1099

1100
01:13:10,766 --> 01:13:16,071
You and I lost everything
at the hands of the Kree.

1101
01:13:16,072 --> 01:13:18,073
Can't you see it now?

1102
01:13:18,074 --> 01:13:19,575
You're not one of them.

1103
01:13:22,612 --> 01:13:24,013
You don't know me.

1104
01:13:25,514 --> 01:13:27,884
You have no idea
who I am.

1105
01:13:29,986 --> 01:13:32,388
I don't even know
who I am!

1106
01:13:33,623 --> 01:13:35,858
You are Carol Danvers.

1107
01:13:37,059 --> 01:13:39,227
You are the woman
on that black box

1108
01:13:39,228 --> 01:13:41,864
risking her life
to do the right thing.

1109
01:13:43,699 --> 01:13:45,634
My best friend...

1110
01:13:45,635 --> 01:13:48,637
who supported me
as a mother and a pilot

1111
01:13:48,638 --> 01:13:50,705
when no one else did.

1112
01:13:50,706 --> 01:13:55,911
You are smart, and funny,
and a huge pain in the ass...

1113
01:13:55,912 --> 01:13:59,247
and you were the most
powerful person I knew...

1114
01:13:59,248 --> 01:14:02,518
way before you could
shoot fire from your fists.

1115
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:04,654
You hear me?

1116
01:14:05,988 --> 01:14:07,823
Do you hear me?

1117
01:14:15,031 --> 01:14:17,033
Come here. Come here, girl.

1118
01:14:17,767 --> 01:14:19,101

1121
01:14:28,945 --> 01:14:31,212
We discovered
that your energy signature

1122
01:14:31,213 --> 01:14:34,016
matched Mar-Vell's core.

1123

Now we know why.

If only you knew
the importance of it to me.

decoding the coordinates
to Mar-Vell's lab.

1127
01:14:49,732 --> 01:14:52,901
Those weren't coordinates.
They're state vectors.

1128
01:14:52,902 --> 01:14:54,970
For orbital position
and velocity.

1129
01:14:54,971 --> 01:14:56,805
You didn't find her lab
on Earth,

1130
