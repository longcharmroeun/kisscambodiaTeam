1
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,580
Whoops.

2
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,457
Places, everyone.

3
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,439
<i> This was it.</i>

4
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:22,641
<i> The moment it all began.</i>

5
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,610
<i> The moment an ordinary</i>
<i> little guy</i>

6
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:27,112
<i> fell in love with the theater.</i>

7
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:28,914
<i> Everything about it.</i>

8
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,250
<i> The lights,</i>
<i> the way the scenery moved,</i>

9
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:32,951
<i> even the smell.</i>

10
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:35,587
<i> He was only six years old,</i>
<i> but his plans to become</i>

11
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:39,324
<i> the first koala bear in space</i>
<i> were suddenly toast.</i>

12
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,293
- <i> -Some folks may have said</i>

13
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:43,929
<i> he grew up to be the greatest</i>
<i>showman the city has ever seen.</i>

14
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:46,532
<i> -Some called him a visionary,</i>
<i> a Maverick.</i> -

15
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:50,302
sure, some folks said he was
as crazy as he was stubborn,

16
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:54,106
but I say wonder and magic
don't come easy, pal.

17
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:56,842
And, oh, there would never
be any doubt,

18
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,344
the name buster moon
would go down

19
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,280
in entertainment history.

20
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:03,015
And I should know,

21
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:06,151
- because I am buster...
- Moon!

22
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:08,153
- Open this door!

23
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:10,289
- Good morning, Mr. moon.

24
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:13,058
Miss crawly. What, uh...
What's going on?

25
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,328
You got a lot of animals
waiting to see you, Mr. moon.

26
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,130
I do?

27
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:20,999
Holy moly, I really do.

28
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,835
Yeah, it's the
stage crew from your last show.

29
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,837
They say their
paychecks bounced.

30
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,639
Tell 'em I'll call up the bank
and make sure

31
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:28,674
they're paid tout de suite.

32
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:30,542
Oh, I got Judith from the bank

33
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,578
holding on line two
right now, sir.

34
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,713
-Um, actually, I'm gonna have
to call her back. -Oh.

35
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,682
What should I tell her
this time?

36
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:39,384
Tell her buster moon
is out to lunch.

37
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,920
Moon! Open this door!

38
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,357
Come on, moon!

39
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,492
I know you're in there!

40
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:00,372
Moon! Open this door!

41
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,276
Aah!

42
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,631
Hmm, thought I heard
someone singing there.

43
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,667
Ah, whatever.

44
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,804
Guys, listen.
Stay where you are.

45
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,105
The cops are here in...

46
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,607
What are you...?

47
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:10,509
-Hold it right there!
-Yeah, I'll get him!

48
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,380
- Go, go, go!

49
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,083
Whoa!

50
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,953
Whoa!

51
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:24,956
Johnny, you were supposed
to be keeping a lookout!

52
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,258
Sorry, dad.

53
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,559
And where's your mask?

54
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:52,184
Look at me. I'm mommy!

55
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,554
Caspar, get off the table.

56
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:59,458
Rosita, have you seen
my car keys?

57
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,695
Norman, would you please
tell them

58
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,163
what a good singer I am?

59
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,299
Oh, yeah, you were great, honey.

60
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:09,735
By the way, the bathroom sink
is blocked again.

61
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:11,536
Bye, honey!

62
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:25,016
One, two,
one, two, three, four!

63
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:45,370
Oh, my gosh.

64
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:47,939
I thought you guys said
you were musicians.

65
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:50,442
Ash, babe,

66
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:51,777
I'm the lead singer, okay?

67
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,211
Just stick
to the backing vocals.

68
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,013
Sorry, I... I get carried away.

69
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,515
Yeah, I know, right?

70
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:59,184
It just kind of ruins my song,
you know?

71
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,611
Aw.

72
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,979
What?

73
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,915
- Come on, make your wish.

74
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:32,284
I wish you'd join a choir.

75
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,785
A local band or something.

76
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,554
-I tried.
-Bah!

77
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,556
Hey, hey, dad,
we've been over this.

78
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:39,791
So she's a little shy.
So what?

79
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:44,629
If I had a voice like meena's,
I'd be a superstar by now!

80
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,770
- Now blow out your candles.

81
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:08,620
A penny?

82
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,188
How dare you!

83
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,524
I happen to have studied
at the Lincoln school of music.

84
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,459
Sorry, it's-it's all
i got right now.

85
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,528
--Oh, is that so?

86
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:20,265
-All right, prove it, pal.
-What?

87
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:22,634
- Empty your pockets right now.
-Trying to find...

88
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24,469
-Wh-what is this you got here?
-Just trying to find...

89
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:25,837
What do you smoke out of this?

90
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,772
That's my inhaler.

91
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,709
Aha! I knew it!

92
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:31,943
You all saw it.

93
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,278
You all saw it right here.

94
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,779
- The monkey lied.

95
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,281
I forgot I had that.

96
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:37,849
And next time, pick on someone
your own size!

97
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,185
Bully!

98
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,497
Take care of her, will you?

99
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:55,867
She may look old and rusty,
but she is a classic.

100
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,807
Okay, listen.

101
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,843
We both know that my theater
has been going through

102
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:07,746
some pretty rough times lately,
but as the saying goes,

103
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,347
"for every cloud,
a silver lining."

104
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:10,649
-Hup-hup-hup-hup-hup-hup.
-We've got...

105
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:12,050
Hold on right there, buster.

106
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,052
My dad, he heard I was
gonna see you today,

107
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,154
and he was all like,
"Eddie, you tell that koala

108
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,756
"I'm not funding any more
of those shows,

109
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:19,324
and that's final."
Those were his words.

110
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:20,525
Well, your dad's right.

111
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,093
Those shows were the problem.

112
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,029
<i> War of attrition.</i>
<i> Rosie takes a bow.</i>

113
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:25,931
I mean, nobody wants to see
that stuff anymore.

114
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,499
So, what do I do?

115
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:29,401
-Quit?
-No.

116
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,937
I give 'em a show they cannot
resist, which is gonna be...

117
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,240
J-just one more minute,
<i> s'il vous plaît.</i>

118
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,409
- <i> -Merci.</i>

119
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,678
Don't speak French.
They speak English here.

120
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,014
Now, my next show is gonna be--
drumroll, please...

121
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,718
...a singing competition.

122
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,753
A singing competition?

123
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,589
Who wants to see
another one of those?

124
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,290
Everyone!
J-j-just think.

125
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,626
Your neighbor, the-the-the
grocery store manager,

126
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:56,528
that-that-that chicken--
right there!

127
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,697
Everyone in this city
gets a shot

128
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:01,366
at being a star
live on my stage.

129
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:03,602
Buster,
this is a terrible idea.

130
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:04,869
Oh, no, it's not.

131
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:07,038
Real talent from real life.

132
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,408
That's what audiences want,
and I'm gonna give it to 'em!

133
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,410
All right, well...

134
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,045
C-can we please just
get out of here?

135
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,480
Don't you want to eat?

136
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:17,115
Yeah, but we can't afford
any of this.

137
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,750
Yes, I know, and that's why...

138
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,719
I brought sandwiches.

139
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:22,053
Uh...

140
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,289
That's not allowed.
Ugh.

141
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,157
What, you don't like
peanut butter and jelly?

142
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,592
- Excuse me, sir.
- Okay, look.

143
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,728
I got cream cheese,
i got banana...

144
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:37,569
-You okay?
-Yep. Never better.

145
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,407
Miss crawly?

146
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,075
Hello?

147
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:46,444
Uh, who is it?

148
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:47,746
It's me.

149
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,514
Your boss, Mr. moon.

150
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,483
-Oh, hello, Mr. moon.
-There we go.

151
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,985
Now, I need you to add
the following information

152
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,087
-to our publicity flyers.
-Yes, sir.

153
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:57,822
The winner
of the singing contest

154
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,825
will receive a grand prize of...

155
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,828
$935.

156
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,664
Hmm. Gonna need more than that.

157
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,765
Just a second.

158
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,036
There.

159
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:12,637
There!

160
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,439
$1,000.

161
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:18,309
- You got that?
- -Uh, $1,000...

162
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,945
Oh! Oh!

163
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,318
Print 'em up
on every single sheet

164
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,187
of paper we have left
and let's spread the word

165
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,288
right away, okay?

166
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,856
Yes, uh, yes, sir.

167
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:38,129
Oh, okay.
Come on out of there.

168
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:48,206
Ah, the winds of change.

169
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,208
Yep, when this show's a hit,

170
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,844
I'm gonna get you
a fresh coat of paint.

171
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:55,180
How are we doing
with those flyers, miss crawly?

172
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:57,849
Oh, yes, sir.
We're all good to go here.

173
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,320
Miss crawly, no!
No, no, no, no, no, no!

174
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,055
Oopsie-Daisy.

175
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,392
Oh, well, I guess that's
one way to spread the word.

176
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,875
Hey, Lance, look at this.

177
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:25,677
Ash, babe, hey!

178
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,288
-You make a withdrawal!
-Yeah.

179
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,425
Meena!

180
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,199
--Hey, hey, hey!

181
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,667
What do you think you...?

182
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,771
Uh-huh. Yeah.

183
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,659
Ow. Mmm.

184
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,362
Ah.

185
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,499
Let's go to work.

186
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,104
And cue the crazy old lizard.

187
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:27,939
Good morning, Mr. moon.

188
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,274
Indeed it is, miss crawly.

189
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:30,775
Top of the morning to you.

190
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,343
I made you some coffee.

191
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,312
You did? Where is it?

192
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,982
Oh, I got a little thirsty
on the way up those stairs.

193
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:41,486
-Shall I go open the doors now?
-The doors?

194
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,755
Well, you've got a lot
of animals waiting in line

195
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:44,956
to audition, Mr. moon.

196
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,191
I do?

197
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,995
Holy moly, I really do.

198
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:56,501
I swear to you, Eddie,
this is no joke.

199
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,636
Look, just get down here
and see for yourself.

200
00:13:58,638 --> 00:13:59,871
I gotta go.

201
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:01,773
This is it, miss crawly.

202
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:05,810
Get your scaly tail downstairs
and throw those doors open wide.

203
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,655
Okay, uh, one at a time, please.

204
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,023
Calm down.

205
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:42,413
- Bye, iggy. Bye, Perry.
Bye, Carla. -

206
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:43,982
bye, Gail.
Bye, Rory. Bye, Mickey.

207
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,650
Bye, moe. Bye, Nelson.
Bye, Hannah.

208
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,018
Bye, Tess.
Bye-bye, caspar.

209
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,653
Phew!

210
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,751
Uh, let's hear from a few more
of the folks in line.

211
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,520
-What about you, sir?
-Well, Bob, I'm a lab technician

212
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,088
for a leading
pharmaceutical company,

213
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,024
but I was born with a gift.

214
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:28,226
And that gift is to sing.

215
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:09,801
Oi, dad. Just going out.

216
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,903
Well, don't be long.
I got the gang coming over.

217
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:20,144
Well, look, I mean,
I'm sure you're gonna get a lot

218
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,246
of namby-pamby animals in here
saying things like,

219
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:23,648
"oh, it's not winning.

220
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,983
It's the taking part
that counts."

221
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,951
Yeah, yeah. Not me, pal.
I'm here to win.

222
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:29,420
That prize, it's mine.

223
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:11,996
Wow! Thank you, Johnny.

224
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:14,132
Okay, next up,

225
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,701
-we have meena.
-Good luck out there.

226
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,037
All right, come on. Here we go.
Come on, you can do it.

227
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,872
You can do it. Okay...

228
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,707
Oh, I'm s...
Oh, I'm sorry. Uh...

229
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,543
Okay. Hey, it's all right.
You know, it's all right.

230
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,311
Take it away, meena.

231
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,817
Uh... okay. Uh...

232
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:35,053
-Mmm... um...
-Anytime, now.

233
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,055
Uh...

234
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,990
Do you want to start over?

235
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:41,359
-Um... uh...
-All right, enough of that.

236
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:42,927
That's quite enough of that.

237
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:44,095
That's it. Come on.

238
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:45,396
Off the stage, Helga.

239
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,365
Go on. You're useless.
Thanks.

240
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,067
Right. Here we go.
Hit it!

241
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:44,622
Okay, that's everyone, Mr. moon.

242
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,290
Whew!
All right, call everyone

243
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,059
back to stage, miss crawly,
and let's get...

244
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:49,594
--Hello! -Ooh.

245
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:52,997
Uh, can I have everybody back
to stage, please?

246
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:55,133
Everyone come back to stage
for selection.

247
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:57,235
Okay.
Thank you, miss crawly.

248
00:18:57,237 --> 00:18:59,604
- You're welcome, Mr. moon.

249
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,947
All right.

250
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:11,482
- Let's see, now.

251
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,584
Hmm.

252
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:21,259
I'll take...

253
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:22,927
-You guys.
-Yes!

254
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,595
And which one of you
is the girl?

255
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,264
Ha ha. Very funny.

256
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:29,200
"Loud and horrible,
but shows promise."

257
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:30,501
Welcome to the show.

258
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,803
Cool.
I guess we could hang.

259
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,172
No, no.
I just want her, not you.

260
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,473
What?

261
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:37,275
All right, the rest
of the group acts,

262
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:38,342
thank you so much.

263
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,678
Oh, don't feel bad, folks.

264
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,280
There will be
a ten percent discount

265
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:43,648
on tickets for everyone.

266
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,149
Yeah, sure, thanks a lot.

267
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:48,352
Let's get out of here, ash.

268
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,154
Ash?

269
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:51,556
Uh, yeah...

270
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:53,891
Yeah, let's go.

271
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:56,294
Okay, soloists.

272
00:19:56,296 --> 00:20:00,932
Johnny, Mike, Pete, Richard,
Daniel and ray.

273
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,067
Mike!

274
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,535
Ooh-hoo-hoo! Wowza!

275
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,070
I've gotta have you in my show.

276
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:08,139
Oh, I... if you insist.

277
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:09,173
And I'll take Pete...

278
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:10,641
Ooh, yeah!

279
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:12,843
And one more.

280
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:14,378
- Let me see, now.

281
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,814
--Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry.

282
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:19,584
--Oh, what is wrong with me?

283
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,520
Um, thanks for coming, Richard.

284
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:24,155
Oh...

285
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,325
- Oh, my... ray!

286
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:28,593
- Are you all right?
- -Uh-huh.

287
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:30,861
Just hang in there, ray.
I got you.

288
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:34,532
--Ooh. Oh. Whoopsie. Oh.

289
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:38,135
Okay, then I'll take...

290
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,771
Daniel.
Thank you, Johnny.

291
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:43,574
--Daniel, can you hear me?

292
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,909
You're in the show!

293
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,210
What?

294
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:48,412
Are you talking to me?

295
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,414
- Yes.

296
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,417
I was saying that you are in...

297
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,753
Oh, geez, this is
gonna drive me nuts.

298
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,388
Johnny, get back here.
You're in.

299
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,957
- Thank you, Daniel. Good-bye.

300
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,292
Yes!

301
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:03,027
Okay. That's everyone
on my list.

302
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:06,364
Um, wait a second.

303
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:07,565
Rosita.

304
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:09,233
-Is Rosita still here?
-Oh, yes.

305
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:10,801
Yes, I'm here.

306
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:12,236
Rosita, Rosita, Rosita.

307
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:14,872
Great set of pipes,
but boring to watch.

308
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,374
I knew it.

309
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,809
So, what should I do?

310
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:22,413
I could partner you up
with gunter.

311
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:23,948
Gunter! Where are you?

312
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,717
<i> Ja! Ja!</i> This is me.

313
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:31,389
<i> Ja!</i>

314
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,990
It's gonna spice things up
on stage.

315
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:35,126
Wait. You want us
to sing together?

316
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,561
<i> Ja!</i> The two of us together,
you joking me?

317
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:39,463
We're going to be spicy, no?

318
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,401
That koala's a fool,
Sherry-Anne.

319
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,569
You are going to be
a star one day!

320
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:47,104
Auditions are over, pal.

321
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:49,507
- Show's already been cast.
<i>- Okay...</i>

322
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:52,109
You are my chosen few.

323
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:53,577
- Yes!

324
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:54,979
This is it, folks.

325
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:58,349
A defining moment
in all of our lives.

326
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:00,451
Um, no.
No, no, no, not you guys.

327
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:01,986
I dismissed all
of the group acts already.

328
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,321
You... you can go home.

329
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:06,991
Look, look, look,
i-I'm really sorry,

330
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,360
but all of the slots are filled.

331
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:13,364
--No, no, no, no, listen.

332
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:14,632
No in show.

333
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:16,200
- Good-bye-bye.

334
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:17,601
- Miss crawly!

335
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:19,670
Come on, you guys,
out... out of here.

336
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,472
Come on, off the stage.

337
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:23,641
- Thank you so much.
- Hey, moon.

338
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:25,676
What's the story? Is the prize
really inside this thing?

339
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,111
The prize? Oh, sure.

340
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:28,446
Yes, it's all...
It's all in there.

341
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:29,814
Well, open it, will you?

342
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:31,615
I want to see
what $100,000 looks like.

343
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:33,217
-Yeah, come on. -Me, too.
-Let's have a look. -Open it.

344
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:34,285
Yeah, yeah, go on.
Open it, Mr. moon.

345
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:35,286
For sure, I'll open it.

346
00:22:35,288 --> 00:22:37,288
Wait. What did you say?

347
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:40,057
He said $100,000.

348
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:42,226
A hundr...

349
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:43,494
Uh...

350
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:46,997
I forgot my keys.

351
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,733
Koala be right back.

352
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:53,170
For the last time, miss crawly,

353
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:55,539
I'm not going to fire you.

354
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,141
Now, would you pull
yourself together,

355
00:22:57,143 --> 00:22:59,210
and please blow
that nose of yours.

356
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:01,145
--No, no, no, not in here.

357
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:03,180
-Blow it outside.
-I'm sorry, Mr. moon.

358
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:04,849
-Thank you.
-Buster, what do you expect?

359
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:07,318
-She's like 200 years old.
-Eddie, please, look.

360
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,854
If-if your folks could just
loan me the money until...

361
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:12,857
$100,000?
Buster, come on.

362
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,392
Hoo! I gotta think.
I've gotta think.

363
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:16,093
I've gotta think.
I've got to come up

364
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:17,695
- with a solution...
-Look, maybe it's time

365
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:20,064
to stop thinking
and it's time to just move on.

366
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,532
I mean, this theater of yours,

367
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:24,201
you could get some decent money
for it and...

368
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:26,170
I don't know, maybe we could
do something together.

369
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:28,739
What? What, sit around
playing video games?

370
00:23:30,343 --> 00:23:31,909
Do you know what that is?

371
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,344
Uh, it's a bucket?

372
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:35,579
Yes, and do you know why
i have this bucket?

373
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,014
'Cause the roof is leaking?

374
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:38,749
No, that's the bucket
for the leak.

375
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:42,086
I have this one 'cause it
belonged to my father.

376
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,721
Every day for 30 years,

377
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:46,090
he worked his tail off
washing cars

378
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:48,626
just so I could buy this place.

379
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:50,694
Every day, Eddie.

380
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:52,963
Just for me.

381
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:54,198
--Wow.

382
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,400
Sounds like a great dad.

383
00:23:58,037 --> 00:24:00,037
So, how do you want
to handle this?

384
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:04,475
Oh, Mr. moon,
i got Judith from the bank

385
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:06,944
holding on line two again.

386
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,182
Well, there's only
one thing I can do.

387
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,552
Okay, everybody, listen up.

388
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:16,253
-Shh, shh, shh.
-I gotta send you all home.

389
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:17,655
Right now.

390
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:19,757
-What? -Huh?
-Yep.

391
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,792
'Cause, like my dad used to say,

392
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,929
"get a good night's sleep
and do a great day's work."

393
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:28,999
That's right.

394
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:31,435
Rehearsals begin first thing
tomorrow morning.

395
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:33,671
And if you want to become stars
and win 100 grand,

396
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:35,473
then you better be ready
to work harder

397
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:37,608
than you've ever worked
in your lives.

398
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:41,145
So get some sleep
and dream big dreams.

399
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:46,851
Miss crawly!

400
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:48,819
Okay, come on.

401
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,154
That's enough now.

402
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,689
Come on, off the stage.
Please.

403
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:53,824
-Dream big dreams?
-I know, it's good, right?

404
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,259
What about the 100 grand?

405
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:56,527
Don't you worry, Eddie.

406
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:58,429
There's got to be
a way to get it.

407
00:24:58,431 --> 00:25:00,164
What? Buster, no, listen to me!

408
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,800
This show is not gonna
save your theater.

409
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:04,668
You're at rock bottom, pal.

410
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,003
Yep, and you know what's great

411
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,771
about hitting rock bottom,
Eddie?

412
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:10,341
There's only one way
left to go,

413
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,676
and that's up.

414
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:19,283
And you can see the lucky few
leaving the theater behind me.

415
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:21,118
Now back to you
in the studio, John.

416
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,787
--Oh, honey, please don't cry.

417
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:25,556
You are not a failure.

418
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:26,891
There'll be other chances.

419
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:29,460
-You just...
-Bah! The heck there will!

420
00:25:29,462 --> 00:25:30,694
Dad, please.

421
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,696
Come on!
Don't you want this?

422
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,565
Well, sure, but I messed it up.

423
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:36,700
Then you gotta go back there
tomorrow and say,

424
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:40,004
"Mr. moon, I demand you let me
re-audition!"

425
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:42,706
Be confident! Show 'em you
ain't gonna be pushed around!

426
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,542
You got that, meena?

427
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:45,976
-Um...
-Good!

428
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:47,645
Now, go get my cocoa.

429
00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:57,655
Would you stop?
I'd only be doing it for us.

430
00:25:57,657 --> 00:25:58,722
Oh, really?

431
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,024
Yes, really.

432
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:01,825
If I won that money,
we could build

433
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:03,861
our own recording studio,
start our own label.

434
00:26:03,863 --> 00:26:06,497
I mean, the whole world
would get to hear your songs.

435
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:22,112
Oh...

436
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,798
Hey! Uh, just a min...

437
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,166
Oh, oh, wait. W-wait!

438
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,769
Oh, look at...

439
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,071
I know Derek, the manager.

440
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:49,306
He'll vouch for me.
Come on!

441
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:51,308
Hey, Mario.

442
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,611
How's it going?

443
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:54,912
Oh, for crying out loud.

444
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:56,914
Oh, yeah, oh, let the bears in.

445
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:59,116
Let the bears in. Fine.

446
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,821
There he is!

447
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:06,590
I got a surprise for you,
my son.

448
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:08,225
--What's that?

449
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:10,561
-Tell him the plan.
-Right.

450
00:27:10,563 --> 00:27:13,597
We've been told there's a ship
carrying 25 million in gold,

451
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,833
gonna dock at night right here.

452
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:18,602
With the usual guards
here and here.

453
00:27:18,604 --> 00:27:22,640
But, lucky for us, there's
a sewer right under here.

454
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:24,908
So the getaway driver
meets us here.

455
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:28,912
And that is gonna be you
this time, Johnny.

456
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:31,415
-What? You want...
You want me to drive? -Yeah.

457
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:34,418
It's time my boy had
a proper role in the gang, eh?

458
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,919
Hang on, hang on, dad.

459
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,321
Barry's always been our driver.

460
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,622
Barry don't mind.

461
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,357
Do you, Barry?

462
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:43,193
-No. No, that's fine.
-Yeah.

463
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:45,596
So... so, when exactly
is this ship coming in, then?

464
00:27:45,598 --> 00:27:47,164
We ain't got a date yet.

465
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,033
Probably won't be
for a while, though, will it?

466
00:27:49,035 --> 00:27:51,969
What do you care? It's the last
job we ever need to do.

467
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:53,671
When it comes in, we go.

468
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:54,805
Right?

469
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:55,806
Great.

470
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:57,775
Can't wait.

471
00:27:57,777 --> 00:27:59,143
- Um, hi.

472
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:00,711
I saw your ad in the paper.

473
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:03,113
Yes, I need a nanny
just for a couple of weeks.

474
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:05,149
You can? Great.

475
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:06,450
Oh, the kids?

476
00:28:06,452 --> 00:28:07,685
Yes, they're wonderful.

477
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:09,820
They... yeah, I have 25.

478
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:11,689
No, I'm... I'm not joking.

479
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:13,624
- Um, but they're really
no problem... -

480
00:28:13,626 --> 00:28:15,793
- hello? Hello?

481
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:17,061
Good night, mommy.

482
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,965
Hey. How was the big meeting?

483
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:25,469
That bad, really?

484
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:28,038
Well, I have something
really exciting to tell you.

485
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,307
Mmm.
You make the best pie, honey.

486
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,009
Listen, Norman,
i know it's short notice,

487
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:34,344
but I could really use some help
with the kids tomorrow

488
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:37,815
because... well, you are not
gonna believe what I did today.

489
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,752
Norman, are you listening to me?

490
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,929
<i> Rehearsals begin</i>
<i> first thing tomorrow morning,</i>

491
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:54,932
<i> so get some sleep</i>
<i> and dream big dreams.</i>

492
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:59,069
Hmm.

493
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:24,862
Good morning, everybody.

494
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,131
Now, I want you all dressed
before breakfast.

495
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,704
Breakfast!

496
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,043
Rosita, have you seen
my car keys?

497
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:42,112
Don't forget, your keys
are in your coat pocket.

498
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,881
Oh, I found 'em.

499
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:46,183
- Bye, honey.
- -Bye, Norman.

500
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,819
Time for school.

501
00:29:50,823 --> 00:29:52,823
Bye, iggy.
Bye, Perry. Bye, Carla.

502
00:29:52,825 --> 00:29:54,591
Bye, Gail. Bye, Rory.
Bye, Mickey. Bye, moe.

503
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:56,493
Bye, Nelson. Bye, Hannah.
Bye, Tess. Bye, Kelly.

504
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:58,228
Bye, George. Bye, Andy.
Bye, Freddy.

505
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,364
Bye-bye, caspar.

506
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:08,338
<i> This contest is war.</i>

507
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,941
This stage is the battlefield.

508
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:13,977
Your song is your weapon.

509
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,914
Now, you only get one shot
to blow that audience away,

510
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:18,749
so choose carefully
from the list of songs

511
00:30:18,751 --> 00:30:20,484
I've selected for each of you.

512
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,920
Ah, talked some sense
into that boyfriend of yours.

513
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:24,488
Lance is an artist,

514
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,423
but I wouldn't expect you
to understand that.

515
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:28,125
You're right.
I don't understand that at all.

516
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:31,595
Now, you'll notice each list
also includes my costume

517
00:30:31,597 --> 00:30:33,297
- and performance suggestions.

518
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:36,033
Okay? Miss crawly will show you
to your rehearsal spaces.

519
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:37,434
Now, let's get to work.

520
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:38,836
Excuse me, Mr. moon?

521
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:40,437
For some reason, it says here

522
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:41,972
that I should be playing
the piano?

523
00:30:41,974 --> 00:30:44,508
Yes, just imagine--
big, soulful guy like you

524
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,976
tenderly playing the keys.

525
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:47,611
There'll be goose bumps
everywhere.

526
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:49,813
Well, I haven't played piano
since I was a kid.

527
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:51,949
Miss crawly, we're gonna need
some piano lessons over here.

528
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:54,218
Yes, sir! Up the stairs.
I'll be right along.

529
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,519
And, Pete, you're in here.

530
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:58,522
- You got it, Mr. moon.

531
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,023
-Check your ego, man.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

532
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,959
-Break it up, break it up,
break it up. -Oh, yeah?

533
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:03,493
Tell ricki. He started it.

534
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:05,696
That's right.
Just like I started this band.

535
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:06,864
My band, Howie.

536
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:08,298
Oh, forgive me, your highness.

537
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,867
- Guys, come on.

538
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:12,970
No, no, no, no, no.
Hey, hey. Out. Get out of here.

539
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,912
--Look, just calm down

540
00:31:21,914 --> 00:31:23,981
and pick a song.

541
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:25,515
-Wow!
-I think we'll probably have

542
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:27,818
a better chance of winning
if I do the singing part

543
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,319
and leave the dancing part
to you.

544
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:31,021
Bah! Are you joking me?

545
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:33,891
You are just in need of, like,
a super cool warm-up.

546
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:35,726
--Come on, let's take off

547
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:36,994
- these clothes.

548
00:31:36,996 --> 00:31:38,695
That... that is not necessary.

549
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,063
Oh!

550
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,398
That is a lot of skin.

551
00:31:43,002 --> 00:31:44,735
Ah, don't you look
so worried face.

552
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:46,403
I've got one for you, too.

553
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,938
Hey, porky!

554
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,073
-Keep it down, will you?
-Sorry.

555
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,342
Hey, moon, you gave me
the wrong list.

556
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:54,344
Cheesy pop's
not exactly my style.

557
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:56,013
Style.
I'm glad you brought that up.

558
00:31:56,015 --> 00:31:57,347
Now, let's see.

559
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:58,515
- There.

560
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,417
Isn't this a great color
for you?

561
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,686
I can't tell.
It's melting my eyes.

562
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:04,721
-You got anything in black?
-Black?

563
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:06,590
What, you want everyone to think
you're going to a funeral?

564
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:08,058
You think you're some kind
of artsy-fartsy type?

565
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,293
No, no, no, no, no.

566
00:32:09,295 --> 00:32:11,628
Bingo! Pop star Princess!

567
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:16,033
Is this part of the competition?

568
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:17,434
Okay, everybody, don't panic.

569
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:18,802
- Don't panic.
- What's going on?

570
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:20,304
Talk to me, crawly.

571
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:23,440
When did we last pay
the power company, Mr. moon?

572
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,242
Oh, for Pete's sake.

573
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:27,044
Okay, don't worry, everybody.

574
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:28,278
I will take care of this.

575
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,646
In the meantime,
you will continue

576
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:31,048
to rehearse in the dark.

577
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,816
-What?
-But I can't see anything.

578
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:34,618
- Don't you worry, Rosita.

579
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,286
I have glow sticks.

580
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,322
Great.
Use this time to shake off

581
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:40,958
those first-day inhibitions,
and I'll be right back.

582
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,826
-You gotta be kidding me.
-Okay, you heard him.

583
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:44,261
- Back to work now.

584
00:32:44,263 --> 00:32:46,063
Come on, everybody.

585
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,475
Whoa!

586
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,844
Sorry, old girl.

587
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:02,212
I'll fix that.

588
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:14,958
- Mr. moon?

589
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,593
You-you probably
don't remember me,

590
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:18,829
but i-i auditioned yesterday,
and I...

591
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:20,163
Hey, listen.

592
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,966
Do you think maybe you could
reach the ledge?

593
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:24,701
Th-that ledge?

594
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:26,436
Whoa!

595
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:28,338
Whoa, that's a heck of a trunk
you've got there.

596
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,007
Thanks a lot, kid.

597
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:32,109
Uh, Mr. moon?

598
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:35,545
M-my name is meena,
and I baked a cake for you,

599
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:38,615
and, uh... uh, I was wondering
if you'd maybe give me

600
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:40,350
-a second chance to...
-Just a moment, please.

601
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,687
Be right with you.

602
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,891
Hmm.

603
00:33:57,136 --> 00:33:59,903
Yay! It's about time.

604
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:01,538
Johnny...

605
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,173
Yep, mind your head here.

606
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:05,175
Hey, can you pull up
that scenic cable?

607
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:07,044
-You mean this?
-Yes, that's it.

608
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:11,081
Great!

609
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:12,916
And the house lights?

610
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:18,889
Wow.

611
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:20,023
Ah, I know.

612
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:22,092
Beautiful, isn't she?

613
00:34:22,094 --> 00:34:23,493
You know what, kid?

614
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:25,395
How would you like to be
a part of this show?

615
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:26,863
Really? Wait.

616
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:28,999
Oh, my gosh, I was just
gonna ask about that.

617
00:34:29,001 --> 00:34:31,568
Great. 'Cause I could
really use a stagehand.

618
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,937
Stagehand?

619
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:35,739
-But...
-Ah, don't worry about it.

620
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,274
You're gonna pick it up
in no time.

621
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:39,242
I'll teach you everything
i know. Follow me.

622
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:42,012
These are the rehearsal spaces
and dressing rooms,

623
00:34:42,014 --> 00:34:44,381
and up here we got workshops
and the main office.

624
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:46,183
Up in the air!

625
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:48,251
Touch your toes!

626
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,197
Awesome.

627
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,798
Awesome?

628
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,201
Yeah, I think the word
you're after is "awful."

629
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:06,570
And that's me
restraining myself.

630
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:08,238
There's not an ounce of talent
between 'em.

631
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,140
Not an ounce.
In fact, you know what?

632
00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:12,943
I think that prize
is as good as mine already.

633
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,249
Yes, indeed, uh,
i am about to come

634
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:21,751
into a very, very large
sum of money.

635
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:24,221
$100,000, to be precise.

636
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:25,989
Well, is that so?

637
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:28,825
In that case, sir, you'll be
wanting our platinum card.

638
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:51,081
Well, well, well, hello again.

639
00:35:58,457 --> 00:35:59,956
Oh, man, these are, like,

640
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:01,591
the cheesiest songs
of all time.

641
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:03,326
I know, right?

642
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:06,263
I mean, I was even thinking
of writing my own song instead.

643
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:07,697
Wait, what?

644
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:10,700
-Your own song?
-Well, yeah.

645
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:12,502
Look, if you want
to win that money,

646
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,638
just do what the koala says.

647
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,706
Why? You think I can't
write my own song?

648
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,708
Whoa, whoa. I'm just saying,

649
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:21,378
not everyone
can write songs, okay?

650
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,713
I know I make it
look easy, babe,

651
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:25,682
but it's not.

652
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:32,289
Oh, here she is.

653
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:35,992
- Quiet down, everybody.

654
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:39,029
So, meena, are you in the show?

655
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:42,365
Uh... well, yeah, kind of,
but...

656
00:36:44,403 --> 00:36:45,735
She did it!

657
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:49,206
Oh, I'm so proud of you,
i could pop!

658
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:51,308
That's my birthday wish
coming true right there!

659
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:53,577
-Way to go, meena!
-Oh, meena, we love you!

660
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:55,045
Mom...

661
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:56,813
-What the heck?
-Wait a minute, wait a minute.

662
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:58,748
Don't be mad, okay?
It was your grandma.

663
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,684
She told the whole street
about your audition.

664
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:02,852
-Mom, no, wait.
-Shh, shh. Shush, baby.

665
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:05,322
You need to save
that singing voice of yours.

666
00:37:05,324 --> 00:37:06,856
So, from now on,

667
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:10,594
just nod
or shake your head, okay?

668
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:21,204
How was that, dad?

669
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:23,006
You're still too soft
on them corners, Johnny.

670
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:24,507
You got to attack 'em.

671
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:26,109
And you're crunching the gears.

672
00:37:26,111 --> 00:37:28,378
I told you, you got
to be gentle with the...

673
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,380
Look, turn that down.

674
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:31,681
Oi!

675
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:34,050
Listen to your father!

676
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:35,952
"Too soft on the corners,
Johnny."

677
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:39,389
"You're not doing it right,
Johnny."

678
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:40,590
"Speed up, Johnny."

679
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:44,594
"Do it like I showed you."

680
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:45,795
Whoa!

681
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:54,471
Dad?

682
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:57,974
Oh, no.
I've run over my dad.

683
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:00,577
Now, that is more like it.

684
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,327
And the three little pigs

685
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:20,130
- lived happily ever after.

686
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:22,032
Good night, my dears.

687
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:30,407
Norman, are you awake?

688
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,843
How was your day, honey?

689
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:36,780
Same as always.

690
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:39,482
-It was?
-Mm-hmm.

691
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:43,253
I don't know
how you do it all, honey.

692
00:38:43,255 --> 00:38:46,089
-Good night.
-Good night.

693
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:05,875
<i> All creatures great and small,</i>

694
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:08,478
- welcome to the moon theater!

695
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:20,223
<i> Mr. moon?</i>

696
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:23,293
-I have Judith from the bank.
-What?

697
00:39:23,295 --> 00:39:25,562
Whoa, no, no, no. Tell her I'll
call her back in the morning.

698
00:39:25,564 --> 00:39:27,364
Oh, I can't.

699
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:29,199
She's right here.

700
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:34,371
Judith! Hello.

701
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:37,073
I work for a bank,
not a charity,

702
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:38,808
and if your accounts
are not settled

703
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,643
-by the end of the month...
-Okay, Judith...

704
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:42,812
I personally guarantee,
by the end of this month,

705
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:44,214
this show is going to be

706
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:46,383
the biggest hit
this city has ever seen.

707
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:48,551
Mr. moon, none of your shows
have ever worked.

708
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:49,686
None of them!

709
00:39:49,688 --> 00:39:51,321
You've had your chances.

710
00:39:51,323 --> 00:39:52,756
Now, settle your accounts,

711
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:55,558
or we will repossess
this property.

712
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,494
Okay. Toodle-oo.

713
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:03,266
What are you going to do,
Mr. moon?

714
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:05,535
Honestly, uh...

715
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:07,404
I have no idea.

716
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,634
Mmm. Are you wearing
a speedo, Eddie?

717
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:39,135
What... what are you...?

718
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:41,271
Eddie?
Is everything all right?

719
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:43,907
Yeah, uh,
just doing my laps, ma!

720
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,445
So, what, you live
in the pool house now?

721
00:40:48,447 --> 00:40:51,047
Yeah, my folks want me
to be more,

722
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:53,616
you know, independent, I guess.

723
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:56,119
They even hooked me up
with this life coach dude.

724
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:58,121
-Life coach?
-Yeah.

725
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:00,723
I guess he's gonna help me
find my purpose in life.

726
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:03,626
I thought I had one,
but it turns out

727
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,462
it wasn't the right one
or something.

728
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:07,130
I don't know.

729
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:09,766
Anyway, he's got me
on this whole schedule thing.

730
00:41:09,768 --> 00:41:11,634
It's, like, mondays,
take out the recycling;

731
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:14,137
Tuesdays, mow the lawn;
Wednesdays, go visit Nana;

732
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:15,839
Thursdays, clean the pool.

733
00:41:15,841 --> 00:41:17,740
It's like, don't we have people
to do all of this stuff?

734
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:19,609
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Back up.

735
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:21,444
Your Nana is still alive?

736
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:22,645
Oh, yeah.

737
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:28,585
Wow.

738
00:41:28,587 --> 00:41:30,019
And she's rich, right?

739
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:31,654
She's loaded.

740
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:34,691
But trust me, you don't want
to go near my Nana.

741
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:37,627
She is one mean sheep.

742
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,448
Good. Lower the moon.

743
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:00,316
-Coffee?
-Thank you, miss crawly.

744
00:42:01,786 --> 00:42:03,152
Okay, that's normal.

745
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:05,154
Just needs a knock.

746
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:07,657
--See? You're getting it.

747
00:42:12,898 --> 00:42:15,198
Anyone seen my glass eye?

748
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,567
The darn thing
keeps popping out.

749
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:22,472
Whoa!

750
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,046
You almost killed me, jumbo!

751
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,148
-It wasn't me.
-Oh, is that so?

752
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:37,520
- Pete?

753
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,757
Pete!

754
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:42,759
- You're gonna be all right.
- Okay, just... -

755
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:46,095
- just hang in there, buddy.

756
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:48,698
- Ricki? Kai?

757
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,899
Why aren't you guys rehearsing?

758
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,401
We're through.

759
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:54,337
They said I'm
an intolerable egomaniac.

760
00:42:54,339 --> 00:42:57,340
I don't even know
what that means.

761
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,710
All right.
We're two acts down.

762
00:43:00,712 --> 00:43:02,745
Give me some good news,
miss crawly.

763
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:06,683
Oh, it's not as bad as it looks.
Uh...

764
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:09,686
- Oopsie-Daisy.

765
00:43:09,688 --> 00:43:11,854
Meena, how would you like
to re-audition for the show?

766
00:43:11,856 --> 00:43:14,390
Really? Well, yeah.

767
00:43:14,392 --> 00:43:15,525
-Great.
-I mean, no.

768
00:43:15,527 --> 00:43:16,759
What?

769
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,528
I-i mean, yes, I can sing.

770
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:22,265
But no, i-i get so nervous,
and... i-i can't do it.

771
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:26,202
I mean, I would totally do it,
but... no, I... no.

772
00:43:26,204 --> 00:43:28,104
I'm gonna take that as a maybe.

773
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:31,874
Great! Look, they're back.

774
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:33,776
Uh, we're gonna come back
to this, meena.

775
00:43:35,146 --> 00:43:37,947
Listen, guys,
forget what I said before.

776
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,816
You are very talented.

777
00:43:39,818 --> 00:43:42,051
Please, join the show, okay?

778
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:44,120
Yes? No?

779
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:47,156
Oh, um... here.

780
00:43:57,569 --> 00:43:59,769
What? Hey, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

781
00:43:59,771 --> 00:44:01,104
D-don't go, don't go!

782
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:05,808
Oh, what is this for?

783
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:09,178
Now, we use this
to follow the steps.

784
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:22,759
Caspar! Caspar, no!

785
00:44:22,761 --> 00:44:24,293
How about this? Ha-ha!

786
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:25,695
- Come on. What did I tell you?

787
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:27,163
I'm so sorry.
He had a fever,

788
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,698
and it was too late
to get a sitter, so...

789
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,600
--Well, you seem fine now.

790
00:44:30,602 --> 00:44:31,668
Wow!

791
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:40,543
--I am not singing this.

792
00:44:40,545 --> 00:44:41,978
What's not to like?

793
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,513
You're a female,
and you're a teenager.

794
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:44,814
This song was made for you.

795
00:44:44,816 --> 00:44:46,182
Wow. It's like you can

796
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:48,284
see inside my tiny
teenage mind.

797
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:50,386
I know, right?
You just gotta add some moves

798
00:44:50,388 --> 00:44:52,221
and a little bit of...

799
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:02,632
-Go for it!
-Oh, you mean like this?

800
00:45:08,406 --> 00:45:10,740
There you go.
You're a natural.

801
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,815
Yes, that was very bad.

802
00:45:18,817 --> 00:45:20,516
Johnny.

803
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:22,185
Come in. Over.

804
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:23,720
Oh, Johnny,
your jacket's talking.

805
00:45:23,722 --> 00:45:25,555
Johnny, where are you?

806
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:27,557
Dad, what's going on? Over.

807
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:29,592
What do you mean,
you gotta leave now?

808
00:45:29,594 --> 00:45:31,360
I know.
I'm... I'm so sorry.

809
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:33,029
It's just, I've got
this family business thing.

810
00:45:33,031 --> 00:45:34,263
Do I need to start worrying

811
00:45:34,265 --> 00:45:35,531
about your commitment here,
Johnny?

812
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:36,833
-Tell me no.
-No. Absolutely not.

813
00:45:36,835 --> 00:45:38,267
I promise it won't happen again.

814
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:40,369
-It better not.
-Thank you, Mr. moon.

815
00:45:57,955 --> 00:46:00,590
Hi. I'm Becky.

816
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:02,391
Becky?

817
00:46:02,393 --> 00:46:03,693
Hey, what did you expect?

818
00:46:03,695 --> 00:46:05,128
You're never around anymore.

819
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:07,764
I did it for us, Lance!

820
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:08,931
You and me!

821
00:46:09,968 --> 00:46:11,601
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.

822
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:14,103
I think I left
my sunglasses in there.

823
00:46:16,141 --> 00:46:17,473
Come on, Becky.

824
00:46:17,475 --> 00:46:18,941
Let's get out of here.

825
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:34,423
Jackpot, baby!

826
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:35,925
-Whoo-hoo!
-Ooh!

827
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:38,261
Well, I say we call it
a night there, fellas.

828
00:46:38,263 --> 00:46:40,663
Hey, uh, put the cash
in my car, will you, Derek?

829
00:46:42,734 --> 00:46:45,835
Well, you're one great
card player, Mike.

830
00:46:45,837 --> 00:46:48,504
- Not so bad yourself.
-Ooh...

831
00:46:48,506 --> 00:46:51,574
Except I still can't tell
how you cheated.

832
00:46:51,576 --> 00:46:53,409
Cheated? Cheated?

833
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:55,511
Oh, I am offended.

834
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:57,380
Come on, baby,
let's cut some rug.

835
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:00,950
Oh!

836
00:47:00,952 --> 00:47:02,752
Wh-what the...?

837
00:47:02,754 --> 00:47:03,820
Oh.

838
00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:05,955
How did that get there?

839
00:47:05,957 --> 00:47:07,290
-Run for it, baby!
-Hey!

840
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:08,291
Whoo!

841
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,227
Get him!

842
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:21,838
Excuse me.

843
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,007
Don't let him get away!

844
00:47:30,448 --> 00:47:32,048
-Thanks, Derek.
-Out of the way.

845
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:42,458
So long, suckers!

846
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:55,171
Good morning, buster.

847
00:47:55,173 --> 00:47:56,973
-Hey, Eddie. How are you?
-Good.

848
00:47:56,975 --> 00:47:59,175
-How's the show going?
-Ah, it's going great.

849
00:47:59,177 --> 00:48:01,344
Hey, that's a sharp jacket
you've got on today.

850
00:48:01,346 --> 00:48:02,745
Oh, thanks.

851
00:48:02,747 --> 00:48:05,047
Wait.

852
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:06,549
What are you doing here?

853
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:08,517
Eddie, you can't come
visit your Nana

854
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:10,086
without bringing her
some flowers.

855
00:48:10,088 --> 00:48:11,721
-Here.
-What? No!

856
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:13,756
Buster, no! Don't go in there!

857
00:48:13,758 --> 00:48:15,091
Yes, can I help...?

858
00:48:15,093 --> 00:48:17,927
-Buster!
-Ah, Nana!

859
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:23,266
Just look at you, dear.

860
00:48:23,268 --> 00:48:24,400
Wow!

861
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,502
You don't look a day over 90.

862
00:48:26,504 --> 00:48:27,837
Oh, my gosh.

863
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,038
Buster moon.

864
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,873
We met at Eddie's graduation.

865
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:32,508
Oh, lucky me.

866
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,744
A visit from my useless grandson

867
00:48:34,746 --> 00:48:37,380
and his ghastly little
theater friend.

868
00:48:37,382 --> 00:48:38,948
Look at that-- she remembers me.

869
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:40,283
Okay, Nana...

870
00:48:40,285 --> 00:48:42,418
How would you like
to be the sponsor

871
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,120
for a very prestigious prize?

872
00:48:44,122 --> 00:48:46,956
Not for that singing contest
i saw on the news.

873
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:48,424
That's the one.

874
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:50,259
Oh, I see.

875
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:53,029
You don't have the money,
do you?

876
00:48:53,031 --> 00:48:54,931
Well, we don't quite have it
all locked in...

877
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:56,232
Well, you'll not get
a cent out of me.

878
00:48:56,234 --> 00:48:57,700
Nana, please, just listen to me

879
00:48:57,702 --> 00:48:59,402
-for one second, okay?
-No, absolutely not.

880
00:48:59,404 --> 00:49:00,870
-Don't listen to him, Nana.
-I'm not listening

881
00:49:00,872 --> 00:49:02,438
-to either of you.
-Just wait one second.

882
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,540
Lapsang souchong, no sugar,
and be quick about it.

883
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:08,077
Uh, Nana, i-i don't know
how to make tea.

884
00:49:10,048 --> 00:49:12,982
Wow. I saw this show
when I was a kid.

885
00:49:12,984 --> 00:49:15,618
Nana, you were
absolutely amazing.

886
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,954
Please, this flattery is futile.

887
00:49:17,956 --> 00:49:20,323
I have no intention
of bailing you out.

888
00:49:20,325 --> 00:49:22,792
Your pathetic shows
are the reason

889
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:24,427
that theater
no longer has an audience.

890
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:26,462
Oh, but this show is gonna...
Gonna pack 'em in

891
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:28,097
like it did
in the good old days.

892
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:31,300
They were not "good old days,"
Mr. moon.

893
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:34,270
They were magnificent.

894
00:49:34,272 --> 00:49:36,339
And that theater of yours,

895
00:49:36,341 --> 00:49:40,176
it was a palace
of wonder and magic.

896
00:49:40,178 --> 00:49:41,610
But, Nana, it still is.

897
00:49:41,612 --> 00:49:43,312
-Yeah, right.
-Ow!

898
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:47,116
I can recall the ushers
in their velvet suits.

899
00:49:47,118 --> 00:49:50,486
Queues a mile long
just to get a ticket.

900
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:55,124
The curtain rising
over that glorious stage.

901
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:59,128
Music and light
bringing dreams to life?

902
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,496
Precisely.

903
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,698
Well, it's just like
you remember it.

904
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,501
In fact, I've made it
even more spectacular.

905
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:06,836
No, you haven't.
-Shh.

906
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:08,204
Come see for yourself.

907
00:50:08,206 --> 00:50:10,006
Uh, a special performance
just for you.

908
00:50:10,008 --> 00:50:11,540
What do you say, Nana?

909
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:13,309
I say...

910
00:50:13,311 --> 00:50:14,877
You are a liar, Mr. moon.

911
00:50:14,879 --> 00:50:18,147
Okay, well, we're done now.
Thank you, Nana.

912
00:50:18,149 --> 00:50:20,349
But anything's better
than spending another evening

913
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:22,451
playing checkers
with this old fart.

914
00:50:22,453 --> 00:50:23,619
What?

915
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:24,653
Great.

916
00:50:24,655 --> 00:50:26,122
It's gonna blow you away, Nana.

917
00:50:26,124 --> 00:50:27,990
And that is no lie.

918
00:50:27,992 --> 00:50:29,692
Now, listen up.

919
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:32,328
Tomorrow we are going to have
a full preview of the show,

920
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:35,898
and our audience will be none
other than miss Nana noodleman.

921
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,166
- Nana noodleman?
- Wow, Nana noodleman.

922
00:50:37,168 --> 00:50:38,367
She's still alive?

923
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:40,069
Oh, yes, and believe me,

924
00:50:40,071 --> 00:50:42,204
she's got some
pretty high standards.

925
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:43,906
All right? So, today,
we're going to have

926
00:50:43,908 --> 00:50:46,075
a full dress rehearsal,
and I want to see you

927
00:50:46,077 --> 00:50:47,710
light up the stage, folks.

928
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:49,645
Well, that's cool.
-Meena? Miss crawly?

929
00:50:49,647 --> 00:50:51,013
What do you think?

930
00:50:51,015 --> 00:50:53,049
Wow, it's so ambitious.

931
00:50:53,051 --> 00:50:54,350
Yeah, are you sure about this?

932
00:50:54,352 --> 00:50:56,585
I promised Nana
something spectacular,

933
00:50:56,587 --> 00:50:59,088
and this-- ha!--
It's gonna blow her away.

934
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:01,323
-Oh, yes.
-Two minutes, everybody.

935
00:51:01,325 --> 00:51:03,225
Johnny.

936
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:04,927
Johnny, where are you?

937
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:08,731
Johnny,
answer the walkie-talkie.

938
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:10,599
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, dad.
I'm here. I'm here.

939
00:51:10,601 --> 00:51:12,168
-What's wrong?
-We got the call.

940
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:13,502
Shipment's coming in.

941
00:51:13,504 --> 00:51:16,172
-Tonight?
-Not tonight. Now.

942
00:51:16,174 --> 00:51:19,008
Meet us on the corner
of Hector street in two minutes.

943
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,954
Stay here.

944
00:51:31,956 --> 00:51:33,789
We'll be back in exactly 37...

945
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:35,257
Yeah, 37 minutes. Yep.

946
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:37,493
- You've told me repeatedly.

947
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,034
I can make it.

948
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:51,440
Bravo, Mike.

949
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,109
Nana is gonna love that.

950
00:51:53,111 --> 00:51:55,211
Oh, you're...
You're too kind, Mr. moon.

951
00:51:55,213 --> 00:51:57,313
And I myself am loving
the new suit, sir.

952
00:51:57,315 --> 00:52:00,216
Okay, can we see ash next,
please?

953
00:52:00,218 --> 00:52:02,218
Ash, let's get you out here.

954
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:04,553
Oh, stand back.

955
00:52:04,555 --> 00:52:06,255
Moody teenager coming through.

956
00:52:06,257 --> 00:52:07,456
Good luck, ash.

957
00:52:39,624 --> 00:52:41,957
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. Okay, enough of that.

958
00:52:41,959 --> 00:52:44,527
- Cut it, cut it, cut it,
cut it. -

959
00:52:44,529 --> 00:52:46,028
--i don't think anyone's

960
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:47,329
gonna call her after that.

961
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:49,298
Okay, ash, um...

962
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,034
Hey, come on, ash.

963
00:52:52,036 --> 00:52:54,136
What is it? Do you...
Do you not like the dress?

964
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:56,405
Ow.

965
00:52:57,374 --> 00:52:58,440
Ow.

966
00:52:58,442 --> 00:52:59,909
Ash, what's wrong?

967
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,884
Well, it sounds to me like you

968
00:53:08,886 --> 00:53:11,554
are way better off
without that... that...

969
00:53:11,556 --> 00:53:14,190
That total super-jerk
dinkleschplatt!

970
00:53:14,192 --> 00:53:17,793
Exactly.
Total super-jerk dinkleschplatt.

971
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:19,128
Rosita! Gunter!

972
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:20,863
-You're on next.
-Yeah, okay, here.

973
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:22,698
There should be some gum or
some candy in there somewhere.

974
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:23,732
Just help yourself.

975
00:53:23,734 --> 00:53:25,067
Rosita, Rosita, Rosita.

976
00:53:25,069 --> 00:53:26,902
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

977
00:53:26,904 --> 00:53:28,404
Can I take your place, please?

978
00:53:28,406 --> 00:53:30,072
- Sure, Johnny. Go ahead.
- Okay, get ready,

979
00:53:30,074 --> 00:53:32,408
'cause I'm warning you...

980
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:36,745
This stage is about to explode
with major piggy power.

981
00:53:36,747 --> 00:53:38,347
I am so sorry.

982
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:40,249
I have no control.

983
00:53:43,187 --> 00:53:44,720
Yeah!

984
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:46,722
Okay, come on, you can do this.

985
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:54,597
Are you okay?

986
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:56,865
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thank you.

987
00:53:56,867 --> 00:53:58,701
- How are you?
- Okay.

988
00:53:58,703 --> 00:54:00,936
Johnny, let's get you out here!

989
00:54:00,938 --> 00:54:03,405
And, you guys, you've gotta
work on that routine.

990
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,708
Take it away, Johnny!

991
00:54:17,021 --> 00:54:18,587
You can't just sing it.

992
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,623
You've got to show
the fire<i> und</i> desire.

993
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:22,524
The fire went out
a long time ago.

994
00:54:22,526 --> 00:54:23,959
What?

995
00:54:23,961 --> 00:54:26,629
Look, I can't even
keep count of the steps.

996
00:54:26,631 --> 00:54:28,464
Ugh! Counting schmounting!

997
00:54:28,466 --> 00:54:31,800
She sings too much
with her head, right?

998
00:54:31,802 --> 00:54:33,435
<i> Ja, ja,</i> see?

999
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:35,704
Forget the steps and just, like,

1000
00:54:35,706 --> 00:54:38,407
let the music take control
of your body parts.

1001
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:40,442
My body parts
are not responding, okay?

1002
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,278
It's never gonna happen.

1003
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,313
I should just be
getting groceries.

1004
00:54:44,315 --> 00:54:46,382
-Rosita, no. -Rosita, come on.
-What? Rosita, please.

1005
00:54:46,384 --> 00:54:48,150
Like, don't go.

1006
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:51,754
Psst! Hey! Hey!

1007
00:54:51,756 --> 00:54:53,389
Down here.

1008
00:54:53,391 --> 00:54:55,958
Have you seen three
nasty-looking bears out there?

1009
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,793
Uh... no.

1010
00:54:57,795 --> 00:55:00,396
Oh, great. Hey, by the way,
i love your act.

1011
00:55:00,398 --> 00:55:02,998
Seriously, the... the part where
you fall flat on your face?

1012
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,668
Oh, that...
That cracks me up, every time.

1013
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:07,469
See you around, porky.

1014
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,013
Ah, man.

1015
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:20,349
Johnny, uh, I know
I'm asking a lot of you...

1016
00:55:20,351 --> 00:55:22,418
Mr. moon, I'm really trying,
i promise.

1017
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:23,752
What about your backup song?

1018
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:25,087
Have you practiced that?

1019
00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:26,855
Uh, well, not yet.

1020
00:55:26,857 --> 00:55:29,958
Well, why don't we go back
and work on that one, okay?

1021
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,194
I mean, look,
if you play like that

1022
00:55:32,196 --> 00:55:35,364
- in front of Nana noodleman...

1023
00:55:35,366 --> 00:55:37,333
Johnny?

1024
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:46,675
--Hey!

1025
00:56:05,162 --> 00:56:07,730
We are set for life now, boys!

1026
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,500
What's going on?
Where's Johnny?

1027
00:56:11,502 --> 00:56:12,868
He's not here.

1028
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:18,040
Run!

1029
00:56:29,253 --> 00:56:31,420
Oh, I'm dead.

1030
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,767
Okay, wait, let me see.

1031
00:56:52,843 --> 00:56:54,710
No, mom, I have not made
any friends.

1032
00:56:54,712 --> 00:56:56,345
What do you think this is,
kindergarten?

1033
00:56:56,347 --> 00:56:57,679
If you hadn't squealed
to the cops,

1034
00:56:57,681 --> 00:56:59,047
I wouldn't be in here right now.

1035
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:00,516
Honey, when are you getting out?

1036
00:57:00,518 --> 00:57:02,551
I'm only gonna be in here
for a few years.

1037
00:57:02,553 --> 00:57:04,019
Well, where'd you
hide the money?

1038
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:05,587
Where were you?

1039
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:07,423
Um, well, thing is, i-i went

1040
00:57:07,425 --> 00:57:09,792
-to get gas, and, um...
-Don't lie to me!

1041
00:57:09,794 --> 00:57:12,628
Um, I was at a rehearsal.

1042
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:15,063
Rehearsal? For what?

1043
00:57:16,233 --> 00:57:18,000
I was at a singing contest.

1044
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:21,637
Look, dad, I'm... I'm sorry.

1045
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:23,639
I just don't want
to be in your gang.

1046
00:57:23,641 --> 00:57:25,874
-I want to be a singer.
-Singer?

1047
00:57:25,876 --> 00:57:27,376
Look, dad, no, it's okay,
it's okay.

1048
00:57:27,378 --> 00:57:28,777
I can get the bail money.

1049
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:30,379
There's a prize--
it's $100,000...

1050
00:57:34,051 --> 00:57:37,453
How did I end up
with a son like you, eh?

1051
00:57:37,455 --> 00:57:39,488
You're nothing like me.

1052
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:41,790
You never were,
and you never will be.

1053
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,091
I'll get you out!
Dad, wait!

1054
00:57:43,093 --> 00:57:45,994
I'll get the money!
I promise!

1055
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:22,865
Johnny! Oh!

1056
00:58:22,867 --> 00:58:25,534
You... you gave me
a fright there.

1057
00:58:25,536 --> 00:58:27,369
Sorry. I didn't mean to.
I just...

1058
00:58:27,371 --> 00:58:28,871
Well, I know it's late,

1059
00:58:28,873 --> 00:58:31,673
but I could really use
some extra piano lessons.

1060
00:58:31,675 --> 00:58:34,309
Uh-huh.

1061
00:58:36,614 --> 00:58:38,580
Mmm. That's it.

1062
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,850
That's good.

1063
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:43,385
You're getting it.

1064
00:58:51,996 --> 00:58:54,062
Shoppers are reminded the store

1065
00:58:54,064 --> 00:58:55,898
will close in 15 minutes.
Thank you.

1066
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,263
The lady in aisle six...

1067
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:03,298
That was awesome.

1068
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:08,036
- All right.

1069
01:00:08,038 --> 01:00:11,406
Mr. moon, are you sure
this is legal?

1070
01:00:11,408 --> 01:00:13,208
Uh... I don't know.

1071
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:14,943
All right, but if you keep
asking questions,

1072
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:16,778
we'll never get this done.

1073
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:17,980
Now, hit it!

1074
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:25,053
A little higher.

1075
01:00:25,055 --> 01:00:26,421
Just a little bit.

1076
01:00:26,423 --> 01:00:28,890
There it is. Thank you.

1077
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:48,677
Hey!

1078
01:00:48,679 --> 01:00:49,911
Posters up.

1079
01:00:49,913 --> 01:00:52,314
-You!
-Now, run away!

1080
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:54,983
Come back here, you vandals!

1081
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:13,135
Rosita, have you seen my car?

1082
01:01:13,137 --> 01:01:14,670
Whoa!

1083
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:19,941
Rosita, what the...?

1084
01:01:19,943 --> 01:01:21,943
What's going on?

1085
01:01:21,945 --> 01:01:23,645
Rosita!

1086
01:01:25,949 --> 01:01:27,149
Whoa!

1087
01:01:28,686 --> 01:01:30,686
Kids, where's mommy?

1088
01:01:37,061 --> 01:01:38,627
Whew.

1089
01:01:38,629 --> 01:01:40,495
How's that, miss crawly?

1090
01:01:42,066 --> 01:01:43,832
- Hey.

1091
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:44,966
Sorry.

1092
01:01:44,968 --> 01:01:46,334
Mr. moon would like everyone

1093
01:01:46,336 --> 01:01:48,203
to meet backstage
before she arrives.

1094
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,747
Wow.

1095
01:01:58,749 --> 01:01:59,981
You wrote that?

1096
01:01:59,983 --> 01:02:01,550
Uh... yeah.

1097
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:02,918
Do you like it?

1098
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,186
Are you kidding?

1099
01:02:04,188 --> 01:02:05,554
It's fantastic.

1100
01:02:05,556 --> 01:02:07,856
You've gotta sing that today.

1101
01:02:07,858 --> 01:02:10,258
Mike, you're on first.

1102
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:11,259
- Sure.

1103
01:02:11,261 --> 01:02:12,427
Uh, just a second here.

1104
01:02:12,429 --> 01:02:13,395
Honey, I'm busy.

1105
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:14,896
What? I can't hear you.

1106
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:17,733
Rosita and gunter,
you're on after Mike.

1107
01:02:17,735 --> 01:02:18,867
You got it, boss.

1108
01:02:18,869 --> 01:02:20,535
Rosita!

1109
01:02:20,537 --> 01:02:21,603
Super cool!

1110
01:02:21,605 --> 01:02:23,071
You've, like, totally come back.

1111
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:25,407
Okay, Johnny, you follow them...

1112
01:02:25,409 --> 01:02:27,843
What?
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, I'm ready.

1113
01:02:27,845 --> 01:02:29,111
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Ash, you're...

1114
01:02:29,113 --> 01:02:30,679
After Johnny. I got it.

1115
01:02:30,681 --> 01:02:32,380
And, meena, last chance, kid.

1116
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:34,683
You want to... you want to join
these guys out there today?

1117
01:02:34,685 --> 01:02:37,753
I-i would.
I-i just get so scared.

1118
01:02:37,755 --> 01:02:39,221
Sure, you do.
All right, but-but...

1119
01:02:39,223 --> 01:02:40,922
You know how
to get over that, right?

1120
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:42,691
Uh, no.

1121
01:02:42,693 --> 01:02:44,760
You just start singing.

1122
01:02:44,762 --> 01:02:46,528
Do what you love,
then you'll be great

1123
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:47,963
'cause you won't
be afraid anymore

1124
01:02:47,965 --> 01:02:50,132
because you'll actually
be doing it, right?

1125
01:02:50,134 --> 01:02:51,533
- Uh...

1126
01:02:51,535 --> 01:02:53,935
Look, do you love to sing?

1127
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:55,971
I mean, do you really love it?

1128
01:02:55,973 --> 01:02:57,305
Of course I do.

1129
01:02:57,307 --> 01:02:59,141
Then you face this head-on,
meena.

1130
01:02:59,143 --> 01:03:00,876
Because,
like my dad always said,

1131
01:03:00,878 --> 01:03:04,079
"don't let fear stop you
from doing the thing you love."

1132
01:03:04,081 --> 01:03:06,314
Uh...
Okay, I'll do it.

1133
01:03:06,316 --> 01:03:08,550
- Great.
- Mr. moon!

1134
01:03:08,552 --> 01:03:10,452
She's here.

1135
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,735
Nana...!

1136
01:03:26,737 --> 01:03:28,770
Oh! Do not even think
of embracing me.

1137
01:03:28,772 --> 01:03:30,238
You got it.

1138
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,307
Eddie, please show your Nana
to the royal box.

1139
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:33,675
Oh, for heaven sakes,

1140
01:03:33,677 --> 01:03:36,344
I'm perfectly capable
of walking.

1141
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:37,679
You nervous?

1142
01:03:37,681 --> 01:03:39,748
Are you kidding?

1143
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:42,484
I'm absolutely terrified.

1144
01:03:47,925 --> 01:03:49,958
Boss.
That's his car, isn't it?

1145
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,193
Right there.

1146
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:54,863
Pull over.

1147
01:03:58,768 --> 01:04:00,135
Lapsang souchong,

1148
01:04:00,137 --> 01:04:01,970
courtesy of Mr. moo... moo...

1149
01:04:04,775 --> 01:04:06,208
Wonderful.

1150
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:11,213
H-honey, honey, the show
is starting, all right?

1151
01:04:11,215 --> 01:04:13,014
I-i can't talk now.
I gotta go.

1152
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:14,783
Of course I love you.

1153
01:04:14,785 --> 01:04:16,952
You think I'd buy you
diamond earrings if I didn't...

1154
01:04:16,954 --> 01:04:19,487
--Where is my money?

1155
01:04:19,489 --> 01:04:21,523
Okay, okay, listen, listen,
i just, uh...

1156
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:24,125
I just maybe kind of, uh,
spent it all.

1157
01:04:24,127 --> 01:04:25,861
You know?

1158
01:04:25,863 --> 01:04:26,962
No, no, no, please,
please, wait!

1159
01:04:26,964 --> 01:04:27,996
I'll give you the money.

1160
01:04:27,998 --> 01:04:28,997
I'll-I'll get you...

1161
01:04:28,999 --> 01:04:30,632
I'll get you $100,000!

1162
01:04:30,634 --> 01:04:31,967
- Where are you

1163
01:04:31,969 --> 01:04:34,069
going to get that kind of money?

1164
01:04:34,071 --> 01:04:35,337
Moon! Okay?

1165
01:04:35,339 --> 01:04:37,239
Moon's got my money.

1166
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:41,843
Who is this "moon"?

1167
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:47,048
All creatures great and small,

1168
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:49,317
welcome to the moon theater.

1169
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:53,154
I am your host,
buster moon, and...

1170
01:04:56,026 --> 01:04:57,726
Okay.

1171
01:04:57,728 --> 01:04:59,394
Behold!

1172
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:03,064
The very first stage
lit entirely by...

1173
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:04,366
Squid power.

1174
01:05:12,509 --> 01:05:13,608
Yeah!

1175
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:14,776
Beautiful work, guys.

1176
01:05:14,778 --> 01:05:16,611
Now just follow me on the beat.

1177
01:05:19,049 --> 01:05:20,181
And as you can see,

1178
01:05:20,183 --> 01:05:22,017
this is no ordinary theater.

1179
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:25,754
This is a palace
of wonder and magic.

1180
01:05:25,756 --> 01:05:27,555
He's done it!

1181
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:29,224
He's really done it, Nana!

1182
01:05:29,226 --> 01:05:31,860
Oh, goodness.

1183
01:05:31,862 --> 01:05:35,397
Now welcome
our first contestant.

1184
01:05:35,399 --> 01:05:36,398
Whoa.

1185
01:05:37,868 --> 01:05:39,868
Which one of you is moon?

1186
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:42,037
Hey, hey, hey,
you can't just barge in here.

1187
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:43,605
You know this guy?

1188
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:44,973
-Mike?
-Right.

1189
01:05:44,975 --> 01:05:47,742
Mike here says
you got his money

1190
01:05:47,744 --> 01:05:49,945
and it's in that box.

1191
01:05:49,947 --> 01:05:52,414
No, no, no, no, no,
just hold on a moment here.

1192
01:05:52,416 --> 01:05:54,416
That's prize money,
and it's not Mike's

1193
01:05:54,418 --> 01:05:55,817
unless he wins it fair and...

1194
01:05:55,819 --> 01:05:57,919
-Give him the money!
-Okay, okay.

1195
01:05:57,921 --> 01:05:59,821
Hey, hey, hey, hey, take it.
The whole chest.

1196
01:05:59,823 --> 01:06:01,389
It's yours, okay?
All right here.

1197
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:02,557
Open it.

1198
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:04,726
Open it? I-i... no. Me?

1199
01:06:04,728 --> 01:06:05,961
Open it!

1200
01:06:05,963 --> 01:06:07,395
Okay, no, i-i...

1201
01:06:07,397 --> 01:06:09,564
I just don't...
I don't have the keys,

1202
01:06:09,566 --> 01:06:11,066
so maybe you can
come back later?

1203
01:06:11,068 --> 01:06:12,734
- Get out of the way!

1204
01:06:12,736 --> 01:06:14,602
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

1205
01:06:14,604 --> 01:06:16,671
- Wait!

1206
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:22,777
Hey, hey, there you go.

1207
01:06:22,779 --> 01:06:24,179
Big guy with a bat.

1208
01:06:24,181 --> 01:06:25,747
Who needs keys, right?
All right, well, let...

1209
01:06:25,749 --> 01:06:27,082
Let's get this thing
squared up now.

1210
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:29,951
What the...?

1211
01:06:29,953 --> 01:06:31,353
That's it?

1212
01:06:31,355 --> 01:06:34,055
That's all there is?

1213
01:06:35,124 --> 01:06:36,191
He lied.

1214
01:06:38,128 --> 01:06:40,195
-Moon lied to us all.
-Well, wait a second.

1215
01:06:40,197 --> 01:06:42,163
-I can explain. Okay?
-He's your problem, not me.

1216
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:43,264
This is just a prop.

1217
01:06:43,266 --> 01:06:44,933
So, where's the $100,000?

1218
01:06:44,935 --> 01:06:46,468
- Hmm?
- You're kidding.

1219
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:47,769
What's the big idea?

1220
01:06:47,771 --> 01:06:48,770
What a huge waste
of everyone's...

1221
01:06:48,772 --> 01:06:50,605
This... this was just...

1222
01:06:58,714 --> 01:06:59,881
Buster, look out!

1223
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:12,394
I'm stuck!

1224
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:40,221
Buster, it's falling!
Let go!

1225
01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:53,735
Whoa, whoa!

1226
01:07:57,274 --> 01:07:59,107
Hey!

1227
01:07:59,109 --> 01:08:01,009
Okay, okay, okay, steady, girl.

1228
01:08:01,011 --> 01:08:02,110
Steady...

1229
01:08:19,129 --> 01:08:22,630
No, no, no, no...!

1230
01:08:27,704 --> 01:08:29,237
Is everyone okay?

1231
01:08:29,239 --> 01:08:30,371
Nana!

1232
01:08:30,373 --> 01:08:33,208
I-i-I'm so sorry. I-i just...

1233
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:35,276
No, no, no, no, no, don't...

1234
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:36,311
Don't go!

1235
01:08:36,313 --> 01:08:39,280
Has anyone seen my glass eye?

1236
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:41,583
Oh, it-it...
It's right here, miss crawly.

1237
01:08:41,585 --> 01:08:42,951
I've got it.

1238
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:50,125
Look out!

1239
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:15,216
No.

1240
01:09:30,966 --> 01:09:32,634
Oh, dad.

1241
01:09:32,636 --> 01:09:34,669
I'm so sorry.

1242
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:48,850
--He must be dead.

1243
01:10:01,965 --> 01:10:04,199
--Oh, my gosh.

1244
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:08,369
Mommy's here!

1245
01:10:14,476 --> 01:10:16,544
I'm standing
at the scene right now, Judy,

1246
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:18,846
and I can tell you
it is a miracle

1247
01:10:18,848 --> 01:10:21,149
anyone survived
this unbelievable disaster.

1248
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:58,353
Um, yeah,
buster moon certainly

1249
01:10:58,355 --> 01:11:00,755
brought down the house
once and for all today.

1250
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:03,858
And, although Mr. moon has not
been available for questions,

1251
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,426
unconfirmed reports suggest

1252
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:06,861
- he was responsible

1253
01:11:06,863 --> 01:11:08,429
for building a water tank
that exploded

1254
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:09,631
and flooded the building.

1255
01:11:09,633 --> 01:11:11,065
I've been told the 250 squid

1256
01:11:11,067 --> 01:11:12,800
who had been part
of moon's display

1257
01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:14,435
- are, in fact, employees...

1258
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:16,037
-Eddie? -...Of three-star
restaurant les calmars...

1259
01:11:16,039 --> 01:11:17,438
- There's someone at the door.

1260
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,940
...and that none of them
were harmed

1261
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:19,974
- during the incident.

1262
01:11:19,976 --> 01:11:21,276
Whether they will be returning

1263
01:11:21,278 --> 01:11:22,744
to their usual work
is not yet...

1264
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,414
Oh, no.

1265
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:28,149
Mr. moon?

1266
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:31,486
Come on, moon,
you can't just hide out

1267
01:11:31,488 --> 01:11:32,820
in your buddy's pool house.

1268
01:11:32,822 --> 01:11:34,489
Yeah, we just want to make sure

1269
01:11:34,491 --> 01:11:36,024
you're all right, that's all.

1270
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:41,396
-Hey, Mr. moon.
-You okay?

1271
01:11:41,398 --> 01:11:44,899
Guys, look, i-i-I'm sorry
about what happened,

1272
01:11:44,901 --> 01:11:46,768
and-and the prize money and...

1273
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:48,169
Oh, it's okay.

1274
01:11:48,171 --> 01:11:50,805
No, none of this is okay.

1275
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:52,307
At least we're all in one piece.

1276
01:11:52,309 --> 01:11:54,409
Yeah, and you know what,
i bet we can find

1277
01:11:54,411 --> 01:11:56,177
some other place
to put the show on.

1278
01:11:56,179 --> 01:11:57,278
- Right?
- Yeah.

1279
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,313
The show?

1280
01:11:59,316 --> 01:12:01,983
Guys, I'm done.

1281
01:12:01,985 --> 01:12:04,319
-Are you serious?
-What do you mean, done?

1282
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:05,453
Come on!

1283
01:12:05,455 --> 01:12:07,755
Didn't you see this? Huh?

1284
01:12:07,757 --> 01:12:10,425
Look, it says
I'm a danger to society.

1285
01:12:10,427 --> 01:12:11,793
- What?
- Gah!

1286
01:12:11,795 --> 01:12:14,662
"A deluded, washed-up charlatan

1287
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:17,365
who never had a hit
in his career."

1288
01:12:17,367 --> 01:12:19,367
Oh, come on,
you don't believe all that.

1289
01:12:19,369 --> 01:12:20,868
Yeah, I do.

1290
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:22,603
Listen, you're not the only one

1291
01:12:22,605 --> 01:12:23,805
who lost something here.

1292
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:25,173
- We all did.
<i>- Ja!</i>

1293
01:12:25,175 --> 01:12:27,275
I mean, I lost any chance
of ever speaking

1294
01:12:27,277 --> 01:12:28,976
to my dad again over this show.

1295
01:12:28,978 --> 01:12:31,713
- Sorry.
- Oh, Mr. moon, don't...

1296
01:12:31,715 --> 01:12:33,681
Ah, forget about it.

1297
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:35,516
What is this?
I don't understand.

1298
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:37,418
Come on,
let's get out of here.

1299
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:42,623
Mr. moon?

1300
01:12:42,625 --> 01:12:45,159
Meena, please.

1301
01:12:45,161 --> 01:12:47,395
Um, i-i baked a cake for you

1302
01:12:47,397 --> 01:12:50,198
'cause, well,
i know you're sad right now

1303
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,967
and probably afraid
to try again and...

1304
01:12:52,969 --> 01:12:54,369
Yeah, I am afraid.

1305
01:12:54,371 --> 01:12:55,870
I'm afraid that this...

1306
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:57,972
This, me, right now,
this is who I am.

1307
01:12:57,974 --> 01:12:59,640
This is...
This is my lot for life--

1308
01:12:59,642 --> 01:13:02,243
that I'm not the guy
that my dad wanted me to be,

1309
01:13:02,245 --> 01:13:03,511
not by a million miles.

1310
01:13:03,513 --> 01:13:04,679
But-but you told me...

1311
01:13:04,681 --> 01:13:05,913
What? What? What did I say?

1312
01:13:05,915 --> 01:13:07,582
Well, you know,

1313
01:13:07,584 --> 01:13:09,884
"don't let fear stop you
from doing the thing you love."

1314
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:13,154
Ah, come... th-that's just
a bunch of stupid, corny...

1315
01:13:13,156 --> 01:13:15,189
-No, it's not.
-What, y-you really believe

1316
01:13:15,191 --> 01:13:16,491
that you're gonna be a singer?

1317
01:13:16,493 --> 01:13:18,059
Well, yeah, maybe.

1318
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:20,328
Well, then you're just
as big a fool as I am!

1319
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:23,431
Look, kid.

1320
01:13:23,433 --> 01:13:27,168
You and me, we-we're both afraid
for good reason.

1321
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:29,170
Right, 'cause deep down
we know...

1322
01:13:30,673 --> 01:13:32,740
...we just don't have
what it takes.

1323
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:14,749
-Hey, buster.
-Hey, Eddie.

1324
01:14:14,751 --> 01:14:16,651
Man, where'd you go?
Are you okay?

1325
01:14:16,653 --> 01:14:18,386
Listen, could you meet me
at the corner

1326
01:14:18,388 --> 01:14:20,221
of dinsdale and lemington?

1327
01:14:20,223 --> 01:14:21,789
Now?

1328
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:23,424
Yeah, please.

1329
01:14:23,426 --> 01:14:25,726
And could you, uh...

1330
01:14:25,728 --> 01:14:27,395
Could you bring me
a spare speedo?

1331
01:14:28,598 --> 01:14:30,331
Speedo?

1332
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:37,839
Hey, miss crawly.

1333
01:14:37,841 --> 01:14:39,240
Oh, hello, Eddie.

1334
01:14:39,242 --> 01:14:41,409
Hey. Did you bring the speedo?

1335
01:14:41,411 --> 01:14:44,579
-The... oh, yeah, uh, here.
-Great.

1336
01:14:44,581 --> 01:14:47,281
- You're a real pal, Eddie.

1337
01:14:47,283 --> 01:14:49,817
Oh, our first customer.

1338
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:51,285
Miss crawly, fill the bucket.

1339
01:14:51,287 --> 01:14:52,653
Be right with you, sir.

1340
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:54,589
--Wait.

1341
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:55,656
What are you doing?

1342
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:56,924
The only other job I know.

1343
01:15:00,797 --> 01:15:03,264
Just glad my dad
isn't here to see this.

1344
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:05,800
Miss crawly, if you would...

1345
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:08,102
Thanks.

1346
01:15:08,104 --> 01:15:10,671
Well, gotta go to work.
Uh...

1347
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:12,373
I'll see you around, Eddie.

1348
01:15:30,193 --> 01:15:32,860
Come on!
I ain't got all day!

1349
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:34,061
Yeah, yeah...

1350
01:15:34,063 --> 01:15:35,563
- Ah, forget it.

1351
01:15:35,565 --> 01:15:37,164
Too slow, dude.

1352
01:15:37,166 --> 01:15:38,699
Whoa!

1353
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:45,206
One moment, please, sir.

1354
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:48,910
Well, you know the good thing
about hitting rock bottom?

1355
01:15:48,912 --> 01:15:52,747
There's only one way left to go,
and that's up.

1356
01:15:52,749 --> 01:15:54,081
Come on.

1357
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:56,317
You wash, I'll dry.

1358
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:02,390
Thank you, miss crawly.

1359
01:16:41,364 --> 01:16:43,731
Buster, where are you going?

1360
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:29,944
I, uh...

1361
01:17:29,946 --> 01:17:31,846
Do you think you could sing
like that

1362
01:17:31,848 --> 01:17:33,247
in front of a real audience?

1363
01:17:33,249 --> 01:17:37,585
I don't know, but I want to try.

1364
01:17:37,587 --> 01:17:38,986
Good.

1365
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:40,521
'Cause I want to see it.

1366
01:17:42,291 --> 01:17:44,792
We are? Seriously?

1367
01:17:44,794 --> 01:17:45,960
--Oh, my gosh! Okay.

1368
01:17:45,962 --> 01:17:47,428
Okay, yes, I'll be right over.

1369
01:17:49,866 --> 01:17:51,365
Hello?

1370
01:17:51,367 --> 01:17:53,000
Oh, hello, Mr. moon.

1371
01:17:54,636 --> 01:17:56,437
<i> Some say</i>
<i> he's the worst showman</i>

1372
01:17:56,439 --> 01:17:58,005
<i> this city's ever seen.</i>

1373
01:17:58,007 --> 01:17:59,640
<i> Some say he's</i>
<i> a walking disaster.</i>

1374
01:17:59,642 --> 01:18:01,342
A loose Cannon.

1375
01:18:01,344 --> 01:18:02,943
Well, tomorrow night,

1376
01:18:02,945 --> 01:18:04,945
<i> the name buster moon</i>
<i> will go down</i>

1377
01:18:04,947 --> 01:18:06,781
<i> -in entertainment history</i>
<i> once and for all,</i> -

1378
01:18:06,783 --> 01:18:09,784
<i> as he and this bunch</i>
<i> of bumbling amateurs</i>

1379
01:18:09,786 --> 01:18:13,554
<i> attempt to restage the show</i>
<i> that brought down his theater.</i>

1380
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:00,101
Ah, don't you worry, Mike.
All is forgiven.

1381
01:19:00,103 --> 01:19:01,569
Just glad you're back
in one piece.

1382
01:19:01,571 --> 01:19:03,104
Oh, yeah, you're too kind,
Mr. moon.

1383
01:19:03,106 --> 01:19:05,072
And, uh, the... the prize money?

1384
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:07,208
It's, uh... I mean, it's...
It's real this time, right?

1385
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:09,710
There is no prize money,
'cause there's no competition.

1386
01:19:09,712 --> 01:19:11,212
Tonight you're singing
for yourselves.

1387
01:19:11,214 --> 01:19:13,013
Two minutes, everybody.
Final checks.

1388
01:19:13,015 --> 01:19:14,348
Singing for ourselves?

1389
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:15,750
Unbelievable.

1390
01:19:15,752 --> 01:19:17,184
What-what-what is...?
Who's he...?

1391
01:19:17,186 --> 01:19:19,019
This is crazy.
I'm out of here.

1392
01:19:19,021 --> 01:19:20,621
- Hello! -

1393
01:19:20,623 --> 01:19:23,691
uh, we-we're...
We're putting on a show here.

1394
01:19:23,693 --> 01:19:26,093
-Hey! -Come on.
-You all should come and see it.

1395
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:28,562
You! Come on!
Come on, fella!

1396
01:19:28,564 --> 01:19:30,164
It's going to be really good.

1397
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:33,701
Hey. How's our new
stagehand getting on?

1398
01:19:33,703 --> 01:19:35,436
-He's learning fast.
-All set and standing by!

1399
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:37,271
I love this headset!

1400
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:39,106
The audience
are in their seats, Mr. moon.

1401
01:19:39,108 --> 01:19:40,241
Great!

1402
01:19:40,243 --> 01:19:42,309
--Hmm.

1403
01:19:42,311 --> 01:19:43,778
- Caspar!
- That's all?

1404
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:45,980
Get your pants back on,
young man!

1405
01:19:45,982 --> 01:19:47,648
Please, you guys, please.

1406
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:49,083
Please sit down!

1407
01:19:49,085 --> 01:19:51,051
Hey, put your shoes back on
right now!

1408
01:19:51,053 --> 01:19:53,754
Zoe, I saw that! Stop it!

1409
01:19:53,756 --> 01:19:56,824
And, Leo,
that is disgusting!

1410
01:19:56,826 --> 01:19:58,893
Well, John, I've covered
many disasters

1411
01:19:58,895 --> 01:20:00,995
for this network,
but this is sure to...

1412
01:20:00,997 --> 01:20:02,930
Oh, oh, they're about to start.

1413
01:20:02,932 --> 01:20:04,565
Okay, guys, listen up.

1414
01:20:04,567 --> 01:20:06,400
Look, I gotta tell you, um,

1415
01:20:06,402 --> 01:20:09,737
there's not much of an audience
out there tonight.

1416
01:20:09,739 --> 01:20:11,172
But you know what?

1417
01:20:11,174 --> 01:20:12,807
It doesn't matter.

1418
01:20:12,809 --> 01:20:14,742
It really doesn't.

1419
01:20:14,744 --> 01:20:17,678
'Cause tonight is our night.

1420
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:20,915
And whatever happens,
i just want you all to know

1421
01:20:20,917 --> 01:20:23,851
how proud I am to be
a part of this with you.

1422
01:20:23,853 --> 01:20:25,920
Good luck, Mr. moon.

1423
01:20:25,922 --> 01:20:28,189
Good luck, every... whoa!

1424
01:20:31,794 --> 01:20:33,761
Whoop. Uh... sorry.

1425
01:20:33,763 --> 01:20:35,429
Just jumped the cue there.
Don't worry.

1426
01:20:35,431 --> 01:20:37,431
I... i-I'm gonna get
the hang of this.

1427
01:20:43,139 --> 01:20:44,271
Here we go.

1428
01:20:49,945 --> 01:20:52,279
All creatures great and small,

1429
01:20:52,281 --> 01:20:54,682
- welcome to...

1430
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:57,852
Oh, hello there.

1431
01:20:57,854 --> 01:20:59,820
Great.

1432
01:20:59,822 --> 01:21:02,790
Welcome to our newly
refurbished, open-air theater.

1433
01:21:02,792 --> 01:21:04,225
Yes, I am your host,
buster moon...

1434
01:21:04,227 --> 01:21:05,526
-You ready, big guy?
<i> -Ja!</i>

1435
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:07,294
I'm, like, totally ready.

1436
01:21:07,296 --> 01:21:08,796
All right.

1437
01:21:08,798 --> 01:21:10,865
Let's do this.

1438
01:21:10,867 --> 01:21:13,067
Gunter and Rosita!

1439
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:38,485
Aren't they great?

1440
01:22:38,487 --> 01:22:39,954
What, are you kidding me?

1441
01:22:39,956 --> 01:22:41,588
It's like watching jell-o
dancing around.

1442
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:44,058
Like you could do
any better, pip-squeak.

1443
01:22:45,328 --> 01:22:46,827
All right, all right, all right.

1444
01:22:46,829 --> 01:22:48,429
Hey! You want to see
something great?

1445
01:22:48,431 --> 01:22:50,798
I'll show you great.

1446
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:24,665
Yeah, mommy!
-Gunter and Rosita!

1447
01:23:25,868 --> 01:23:27,434
Kids, no.
Back to your seats.

1448
01:23:27,436 --> 01:23:29,703
-The show's still...
-Okay, okay. Aah!

1449
01:23:29,705 --> 01:23:31,839
- Norman!

1450
01:23:38,981 --> 01:23:41,281
All right! Piggy power!

1451
01:23:46,654 --> 01:23:48,789
- That was great!

1452
01:23:48,791 --> 01:23:50,524
Well, it seems I'm not

1453
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:52,526
the only one who actually
enjoyed that.

1454
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:55,729
Crowds are beginning
to arrive at the scene.

1455
01:23:55,731 --> 01:23:57,031
--Help!

1456
01:23:57,033 --> 01:23:58,699
I'm so sorry, Mr. moon.

1457
01:23:58,701 --> 01:24:00,200
Johnny, you're on next.

1458
01:24:43,846 --> 01:24:45,913
What is that?
Turn it down, will you?

1459
01:24:48,451 --> 01:24:50,551
Oi, didn't you hear me?

1460
01:24:50,553 --> 01:24:52,352
I said turn it...

1461
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:27,921
-What the...?
-Hey, hey!

1462
01:26:23,212 --> 01:26:24,811
What about that, huh?

1463
01:26:24,813 --> 01:26:26,813
Give it up for Johnny, folks.

1464
01:26:26,815 --> 01:26:28,549
--Yeah!

1465
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:39,693
Johnny! Johnny!

1466
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:41,695
What's with the face?
You were great.

1467
01:26:41,697 --> 01:26:43,096
They loved you.

1468
01:26:44,732 --> 01:26:46,700
Yeah, thanks, Rosita.

1469
01:26:57,545 --> 01:26:58,845
All right.

1470
01:26:58,847 --> 01:27:00,380
Welcome to all you newcomers.

1471
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:03,150
You are just in time
to meet a teenager

1472
01:27:03,152 --> 01:27:05,819
who was recently dumped
by her boyfriend.

1473
01:27:05,821 --> 01:27:08,322
- Aw...
- I know, right?

1474
01:27:08,324 --> 01:27:10,424
But she's gonna chase
those blues away

1475
01:27:10,426 --> 01:27:12,192
with a song of her very own.

1476
01:27:12,194 --> 01:27:16,530
Allow me to introduce
the singing sensation, ash.

1477
01:27:32,615 --> 01:27:34,181
--Judith?

1478
01:27:34,183 --> 01:27:36,850
You are all trespassing
on private property.

1479
01:27:36,852 --> 01:27:38,385
-What?!
-And you will leave right now.

1480
01:27:38,387 --> 01:27:40,120
I didn't... no, no, no,
no, no, no, Judith...

1481
01:27:40,122 --> 01:27:41,121
All of you.

1482
01:28:46,689 --> 01:28:48,955
Ugh. Seriously?

1483
01:28:48,957 --> 01:28:50,957
She's not even that good.

1484
01:28:50,959 --> 01:28:53,126
Yeah, yeah, totally.

1485
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:53,754
Uh, you guys okay?

1486
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,561
Ash! Ash! Ash! Ash!

1487
01:30:01,563 --> 01:30:02,729
Ash! Ash! Ash!

1488
01:30:02,731 --> 01:30:05,599
What about that?

1489
01:30:05,601 --> 01:30:09,503
We just witnessed the birth
of a genuine rock star!

1490
01:30:09,505 --> 01:30:11,838
Moon, you...
You've got some stuck here.

1491
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,240
Ow!

1492
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:25,852
He may be tiny,

1493
01:30:25,854 --> 01:30:28,388
but there is no denying
his enormous talent.

1494
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:31,925
Would you please welcome
to the stage Mike.

1495
01:30:31,927 --> 01:30:33,727
What are you doing back here?

1496
01:30:33,729 --> 01:30:35,228
Relax, sweetheart.
Just came back

1497
01:30:35,230 --> 01:30:37,431
to show you bozos
how it's really done.

1498
01:30:37,433 --> 01:30:39,399
Now, watch this.

1499
01:31:12,301 --> 01:31:13,667
That is Mike!

1500
01:31:54,142 --> 01:31:55,709
I'm so proud of you.

1501
01:32:06,455 --> 01:32:07,721
Uh-oh.

1502
01:32:16,865 --> 01:32:18,231
You gotta be kidding me.

1503
01:32:48,230 --> 01:32:50,030
Negative.
I've lost sight of the suspect

1504
01:32:50,032 --> 01:32:51,831
and am terminating pursuit.

1505
01:33:09,718 --> 01:33:13,253
That pip-squeak
really was great.

1506
01:33:13,255 --> 01:33:14,421
Thank you.

1507
01:33:14,423 --> 01:33:15,722
Thank you so much.

1508
01:33:15,724 --> 01:33:17,457
Oh, please.
You're too kind, really.

1509
01:33:17,459 --> 01:33:19,092
Look at me.
I'm turning red.

1510
01:33:19,094 --> 01:33:20,760
Stop. I can't take it.

1511
01:33:20,762 --> 01:33:22,395
Keep... keep it coming.

1512
01:33:22,397 --> 01:33:24,097
Well, I better get back.

1513
01:33:24,099 --> 01:33:26,066
They'll be wondering
what happened to me.

1514
01:33:26,068 --> 01:33:28,568
You'll visit me, though, yeah?

1515
01:33:28,570 --> 01:33:30,103
Yeah, course I will.

1516
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:33,273
See you, son.

1517
01:33:42,584 --> 01:33:46,886
We have one final act
for you tonight.

1518
01:33:46,888 --> 01:33:48,655
Would you please welcome
to the stage

1519
01:33:48,657 --> 01:33:51,825
for her first ever
live appearance...

1520
01:33:51,827 --> 01:33:53,126
Meena.

1521
01:33:55,831 --> 01:33:57,530
Meena?

1522
01:33:58,599 --> 01:34:00,600
Is she coming out?

1523
01:34:00,602 --> 01:34:02,802
Meena, what's wrong?
Are you okay?

1524
01:34:02,804 --> 01:34:05,005
Uh, I can't move.

1525
01:34:05,007 --> 01:34:07,474
I'm... I'm terrified.

1526
01:34:10,278 --> 01:34:11,911
Give me your hand, kid.

1527
01:34:14,149 --> 01:34:15,148
Okay, deep breaths.

1528
01:34:15,150 --> 01:34:16,182
Deep breaths.

1529
01:34:16,184 --> 01:34:18,018
And remember what I told you.

1530
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:20,120
You will not
feel afraid anymore

1531
01:34:20,122 --> 01:34:23,423
if you just start singing.

1532
01:34:23,425 --> 01:34:25,825
- Meena! Meena!

1533
01:34:25,827 --> 01:34:28,261
I can do it... okay.

1534
01:34:28,263 --> 01:34:30,430
Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry. Um...

1535
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:35,368
Uh, okay.

1536
01:34:36,637 --> 01:34:38,638
Uh... uh...

1537
01:34:41,510 --> 01:34:43,610
Sing.

1538
01:34:44,712 --> 01:34:46,713
Okay.

1539
01:36:16,905 --> 01:36:18,138
Whoo-hoo!

1540
01:36:23,812 --> 01:36:25,912
Guys, guys, wait.
We can talk this over, right?

1541
01:36:25,914 --> 01:36:27,781
We're all reasonable
individuals here.

1542
01:36:32,787 --> 01:36:34,120
Get in! Quick!

1543
01:36:34,122 --> 01:36:35,555
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

1544
01:36:36,792 --> 01:36:38,224
Whew! That was close.

1545
01:36:38,226 --> 01:36:39,459
Yeah.

1546
01:37:39,454 --> 01:37:40,520
Come on!

1547
01:38:20,995 --> 01:38:24,030
-Meena! You did it! -That's my
granddaughter! -She did it!

1548
01:38:24,032 --> 01:38:26,165
Go, go!

1549
01:38:34,375 --> 01:38:37,610
Oh, dad,
i wish you could see this.

1550
01:39:55,489 --> 01:39:57,457
Everybody ready?

1551
01:39:57,459 --> 01:40:00,927
All creatures great and small,

1552
01:40:00,929 --> 01:40:04,998
welcome to the new moon theater.
