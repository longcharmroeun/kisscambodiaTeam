is the most important event of the season

happened with Dottie.

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,100

before that, too. It's hard to explain.

-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
-It wasn't so hard to fit in after all.

And it's looking good

19
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,514
We've got something cooking

21
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:39,219

Lead to complications

22

Hmm.

00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,072
-Yep! Definitely pregnant.
-(WANDA CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

37
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:34,945
Well, that much we figured.

38
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,990
It's just kinda taken us by surprise.

39
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:39,284
It's just kinda suddenly.
Quite suddenly, wasn't it?

40
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:42,788
I mean, practically overnight.
I mean... (HESITATES) How did this happen?

41
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,710
You see, when a man and a woman

42
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,376
love each other very much...

43
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,179
Well, we're just tickled pink, or blue.

44
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,849
You're at about four months now.
Is that right?

45
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,267
I thought as much.

46

We let the little ladies keep tabs
on their growing babies with fruit.

47
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,145
Makes it simple for them.

48
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,727
At four months,
the fetus is about as big as a pear.

49
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,147
At five months, a papaya. Six, grapefruit.

50
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:18,816
-Seven, pineapple. Eight, honeydew.

what size fruit would it be
at, say, hmm, 12 hours?

53
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,371
Uh, pardon? 12 hours?

54
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,995
Well, I think this line of questioning
is fruitless. (CHUCKLES)

Well, hypothetically speaking,
should we be concerned?

Well, I have nerves of steel,
so there goes your theory, Mr. Doctor...

00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,888
Good idea. Yes.

for dropping by, Dr. Nielson.

I don't know,
everything's happening so quickly.

I estimate the baby's due...

It's not a constant progression,
assumingly logarithmic,

the fetal development thus far...
