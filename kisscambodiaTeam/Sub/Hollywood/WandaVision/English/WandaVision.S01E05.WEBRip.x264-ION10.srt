00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:53,776
(CLEARS THROAT) There's a briefing in ten.
Pants are encouraged.

180
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,657
-Thank you.
-This is Dr. Darcy Lewis.

181
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,754
She's the one
who discovered the broadcast.

182
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,499
-I'm...
-Monica. I know. Um, big fan.

183
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:04,212
We're gonna need to take these again.
There's something wrong with the machine.

184
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,344
DARCY: Those are blank.

185
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,420
DOCTOR: Like I said.

186
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:07,665
Well, what about her labs?

187
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:08,836
I need another blood draw.

188
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:11,394
(CHUCKLES) No, no, no. We're done here.

189
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,934
She does that. See you at the briefing.

190
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,232
HAYWARD: Morning.

191
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,440
We are now assessing a more clear picture
of this crisis.

192
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,402
And thanks to Captain Rambeau,

193
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:30,072
we now have first-person intel
from inside the Westview Anomaly.

194
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:33,873
Our initial theory had
Wanda Maximoff as one of many victims.

195
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:36,829
We now know
she is the principal victimizer.

196
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:38,788
Jimmy.

197
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,328
WOO: Quick history on our subject.

198
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:45,915
Born in Sokovia in 1989
to Irina and Oleg Maximoff,

199
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,633
both killed during an air raid

200
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:50,593
when Maximoff
and her twin brother, Pietro, were ten.

201
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:54,144
HAYWARD: The twins were subsequently
radicalized, volunteering at HYDRA.

202
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,559
It's an oversimplification
of events, but, yes.

203
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:01,099
After unspecified experimentation
with the Mind Stone,

204
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:05,145
Maximoff gained
telekinetic and telepathic abilities.

205
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,360
Back up, Jimmy.
Does Maximoff have an alias?

206
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,361
-No, sir.
-No funny nickname?

207
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:12,695
Not a one.

208
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,819
And earliest tracking had her using
her powers against the Avengers.

209
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:16,908
Is that correct?

210
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:20,162
Right before she earned their trust
and became one herself.

211
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:24,706
HAYWARD: Lagos and Germany,
we all know how that turned out.

212
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:26,631
Thanks, Jimmy.

213
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,216
Now that we have the lay of the land,
let's talk about strategy.

214
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,299
It is the policy...

215
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,053
(SOFTLY) I try
not to speak ill of people...

216
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,635
Then allow me. Hayward's a...

217
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,800
...terrorists.

218
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:39,848
Wanda's not a terrorist.

219
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:42,232
HAYWARD: By your own account,
you described the experience

220
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,349
of being under her mind-control as

221
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,567
"excruciating, terrifying, a violation."

222
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,317
GERALDINE: Wanda, what's up?

223
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:55,994
And now that I've gone all corporate...

224
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:59,413
My point is, I don't believe
she has a political agenda

225
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,373
or any inclination toward destruction.

226
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,623
Monica, she blasted you
halfway across New Jersey.

227
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,865
And I survived
because she chose to protect me.

228
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,628
She's holding thousands of people hostage.

229
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,260
And it could have been thousands more
if she hadn't put up her own quarantine.

230
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:17,011
Listen, I don't believe
this is a premeditated act of aggression.

231
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,354
HAYWARD: You don't?

232
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:20,681
Bring up the visual.

233
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,193
This morning,
I received authorization to share

234
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:28,189
this highly-sensitive material
from S.W.O.R.D. headquarters.

235
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:33,112
Until very recently, it was the top-secret
location of the Vision's corpse.

236
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:37,163
(GLASS SHATTERS)

237
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,292
-When was this?
-HAYWARD: Nine days ago.

238
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,745
Maximoff stormed our facility,
stole the Vision's body,

239
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:53,667
and resurrected him.

240
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:57,545
But that's in direct violation
of Section 36 B of the Sokovia Accords.

241
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,604
And the Vision's own living will.

242
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,007
He didn't want to be anybody's weapon.

243
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:05,477
Maximoff, in her grief,
disregarded his wishes.

244
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,188
All right, that's it for now.

245
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,270
Let's work the problem, people. Dismissed.

00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:29,528
AGNES: Found him in my azalea bushes.

524
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:31,528
Don't know how many leaves he ate.

525
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:34,110
I didn't find him until it was too late.

526
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:36,822
Oh...

527
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:41,947
Tommy, Billy, I'm so sorry.

528
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:45,119
Wait. Don't. Don't.

529
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:47,747
-Don't what?
-Don't age yourselves up.

530
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:52,505
The urge to run
from this feeling is powerful.

531
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:53,719
I know.

532
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:57,179
It's too sad.

533
00:27:57,928 --> 00:28:01,598
You can fix anything, Mom. Fix the dead.

534
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:04,273
What?

535
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:07,937
No.

536
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:10,726
You can do that?

537
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:18,451
I am trying to tell you

538
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:21,832
that there are rules in life, okay?

539
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:26,500
We can't rush aging
just because it's convenient. (CHUCKLES)

540
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:31,671
And we can't reverse death.

541
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:34,461
No matter how sad it makes us.

542
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,340
Okay? Some things are forever.

543
00:28:38,302 --> 00:28:40,602
-(SIGHS)
-You said family is forever.

544
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:42,929
TOMMY: He is family.

545
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:44,725
Bring him back, Mom.

546
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:46,939
VISION: Bring who back?

547
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:52,939
(SIGHS)

548
00:28:57,821 --> 00:29:00,781
Oh, boys. Come here.

549
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:06,955
(SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING)

550
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:22,548
How are the boys?

551
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:26,017
A little heartbroken,
but they'll be all right.

552
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:35,819
Well, it's not often you get a dog
and bury them the same day.

553
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:38,821
Well, life moves pretty fast
out in the suburbs.

554
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,910
I spoke with Norm.

555
00:29:45,494 --> 00:29:46,504
Oh?

556
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:49,461
I unearthed the man's
suppressed personality

557
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,750
and I spoke to him free of your oversight.

558
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:54,592
He was in pain, Wanda.

559
00:29:56,088 --> 00:29:57,758
Vision... (CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

560
00:29:58,757 --> 00:30:00,627
-Listen, can we just...
-VISION: What?

561
00:30:01,927 --> 00:30:03,097
Watch TV?

562
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:07,892
Turn in for the night so that
you can change everything over again?

563
00:30:07,975 --> 00:30:09,175
No, Wanda.

564
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:12,731
You can't control me the way you do them.

565
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:15,856
Can't I?

566
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:18,071
(MUSIC PLAYING)

567
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:20,451
(APPLAUSE)

568
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:21,739
I'm going to bed.

569
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:23,662
VISION: No! We're not done here.

570
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:27,367
What is the "Maximoff Anomaly"?

571
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:28,452
The what?

572
00:30:29,246 --> 00:30:32,036
I have to believe
that this, whatever this is,

573
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:33,544
was subconscious at first

574
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,165
and that you only
recently became aware of it.

575
00:30:36,253 --> 00:30:38,713
Aware of what?

576
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:40,667
-Norm has a family, Wanda!
-(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

577
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:42,887
He has a family, and he can't reach them

578
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:46,348
-because you won't let him reach them!
-I don't know what you're talking about!

579
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,060
Stop lying to me!

580
00:30:48,182 --> 00:30:54,272
-(ELECTRICITY BUZZING)
-This, all of this is for us.

581
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:56,654
So let me handle it.

582
00:30:56,732 --> 00:30:58,572
What is outside of Westview?

583
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:01,898
You don't wanna know, I promise you.

584
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:05,157
You don't get to make
that choice for me, Wanda!

585
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:09,237
You've never talked to me
like this before.

586
00:31:09,328 --> 00:31:12,078
Before what? (VOICE RISES) Before what?

587
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:14,374
I can't remember my life before Westview.

588
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:16,128
I don't know who I am!

589
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,590
I'm scared!

590
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:19,917
(BUZZING STOPS)

591
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:22,545
You are my husband.

592
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:26,893
You are Tommy and Billy's father.

593
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,680
Isn't that enough?

594
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:36,185
Wanda, why are there
no other children in Westview?

595
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:38,071
Oh, God! There are! Just stop it!

596
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:39,318
No. No.

597
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:43,203
The playground stands empty
every morning I walk to work.

598
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:44,358
Why? Tell me why?

599
00:31:44,446 --> 00:31:47,486
Do you really think
that I am controlling everything?

600
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:52,285
That I am somehow
in charge of everybody in Westview?

601
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:54,121
I'm walking their dogs,
mowing their lawns,

602
00:31:54,206 --> 00:31:56,286
getting them to
dentist appointments on time?

603
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:58,035
I mean, I... (CHUCKLES DRYLY)

604
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:04,341
I don't know how any of this started
in the first place.

605
00:32:05,843 --> 00:32:09,933
Wanda, what you're doing here, it's wrong.

606
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:12,143
-I... (WHIMPERS)
-It is wrong.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

608
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:21,023
I didn't do that.

609
00:32:21,108 --> 00:32:22,568
I...

610
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:27,196
You don't believe me.

611
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:31,701
Wanda, I want to, but at this point,
I'm ignoring statistics entirely.
