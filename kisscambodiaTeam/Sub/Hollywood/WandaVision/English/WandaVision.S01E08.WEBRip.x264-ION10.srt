Wanda Maximoff?
It's an honor to meet you.

360
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:54,085
-Truly.
-Who are you?

361
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:56,183
Director Tyler Hayward.

362
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,430
I understand
you're here to see the Vision,

363
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:02,933
to recover the body, that is,
is that right?

364
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:06,056
-Well, I'm his next of kin.
-I understand.

365
00:28:07,396 --> 00:28:08,766
I'd like to show you something.

366
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:10,266
And then you'll give him to me?

367
00:28:11,984 --> 00:28:13,784
Please, just come with me.

What is this?
Why are you showing me this?

370
00:28:34,423 --> 00:28:36,593
Because you asked to see it.

371
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,570
(SHUDDERING) Stop... Stop...

372
00:28:59,865 --> 00:29:01,025
Stop it!

373
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:03,367
What...

374
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,330
What are you doing to him?

375
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:14,251
We're dismantling the most sophisticated,
sentient weapon ever made.

376
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:17,633
But Vision's not a weapon.
You can't do this.

377
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:21,506
In fact, it is our legal
and ethical obligation.

378
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:24,675
I just wanna bury him.
That's all I want.

379
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:28,185
-Are you sure?
-Excuse me?

380
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:30,398
Not everyone has the kind of power

381
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:33,569
that could bring their soulmate
back online.

382
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:37,073
Forgive me. Back to life.

383
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,572
No, I can't do that. It's...

384
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:43,702
That's not why I'm here.

385
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:46,038
Okay.

386
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:50,424
But I cannot allow you to take
three-billion dollars' worth of vibranium

387
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:51,919
just to put it in the ground.

388
00:29:54,419 --> 00:30:00,299
So, the best I can do is,
let you say goodbye to him here.

389
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:08,429
WANDA: He's all that I have.
HAYWARD: Well, that's just it, Wanda.

390
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:11,346

HAYWARD: Fall back.

393
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:40,970
It's fine. Let her see for herself.

394
00:31:00,903 --> 00:31:02,703
I can't feel you.

395
00:31:13,457 --> 00:31:15,377

You have no idea how dangerous you are.

You're supposed to be a myth.
