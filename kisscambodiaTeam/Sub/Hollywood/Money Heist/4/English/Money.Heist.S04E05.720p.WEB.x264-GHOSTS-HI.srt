00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,434

- [Moscow] Yeah, I'm gonna talk to him.

2
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:15,218
- [Denver] You promise?
- [Moscow] Of course.

3
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:17,250
- [Moscow] We'll do it soon.
- Okay.

4
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,916
Papa! Papa, he's coming.

5

- Calm down.

6

- [Denver] There he is.
- [Moscow] I'll ask him.

7

Professor...

8
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,625
Professor, would you like a little...

9
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,666
a little coffee, huh?

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,833
Well, yes, that'd be great. Thank you.

11
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,041
Good morning.

12
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,000
[Moscow] Here's your coffee.

13
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,333
Want some cookies, Professor?

14
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:41,583
Okay, um...

15
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,208
Thank you.

16
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:49,666
You have something to ask me?

17
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,583
[Moscow] Mm... Um...

18
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,375
[Denver] Uh...

19
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,500
- One little thing.
- Yeah, uh...

20
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,166
A really quick question.

21
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:00,416
Do you have a brother?

22
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:04,750
Please. No personal questions.
It's one of the first rules, so please...

23
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:08,333
So, I have a buddy.
He's... He's like a brother.

24
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,291
We were in the mine together,

25
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:12,166
stole together, in jail together.

26
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,375
And that's the problem, because I'm out,
and he still has five years left.

27
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:19,125
- Five years, Professor.
- Yes, well, it's just that...

28
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:22,166
I'm sorry, but I don't know
what I can do for your...

29
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,333
for your friend or your brother, whoever.

30
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:25,958
No, it's his son.

31
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,291
- For his son?
- Yes, Juanito. He's my godson.

32
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,291
He's also like a brother to me.

33
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:33,708
[Moscow] I promised him
when I got out of jail to look after him.

34
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:37,833
And we haven't seen him in a long time,
and we've just heard he's not doing well.

35
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:40,458
He's out of work, almost homeless.

36
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:44,291
And I thought it'll give him
a fresh start... if we bring him here.

37
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,708
You think it's better
getting him involved with a heist?

38
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:48,375
This heist is incredible.

39
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:50,250
[laughs] Just look at this kid.

40
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,583
I've never seen him
more focused in my life.

41
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:56,750
And if it works out, when there's food
for a hundred, there's food for one more.

42
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,833
- Moscow, I'm really sorry. It's...
- This guy is incredible.

43
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:01,833
No. It doesn't matter if he's amazing.

44
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,708
[Denver]
He's good at everything.

45
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,250
[Professor] Why do you think

46
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,458
we call you Denver and you Moscow

47
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,291
and Helsinki? It's a matter safety.

48
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:13,083
No one's supposed to know the names
of the others in the heist. You can't...

49
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,291
Moscow, listen to me.

50
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:17,708
I already made an exception by bringing in
your son. And now your godson?

51
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:21,000
It's not a family business where we can
suddenly give your second cousin a job...

52
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,000
Wait. What the fuck
are you talking about, nerd?

53
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,601
- What?
- Hey, hey. Watch your language!

54
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,465
Hold on.
What we're talking about here is a guy

55
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,380
- who's almost homeless, Papa.
- [Moscow] Relax.

56
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,892
We're putting our lives on the line
for this jerk, and he repays us

57
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,708
with some shit about city names?

58
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,875
Professor, do you know what I'm gonna do
with the name Denver?

59
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,916
I'm gonna stick it up your ass
because my name is Dani.

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,333
I've been Dani my whole life.
I'll tell you another thing.

61
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:44,375
Your plan, your perfect plan
for the Royal Mint of Spain,

62
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,625
it's bullshit.
Real fucking bullshit.

63
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,375
There's a printer downstairs.

64
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:51,125
We can print the bills here
and it'll be a lot easier.

65
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,875
Thank you so much for the coffee.

66
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,875
[Denver scoffs]

This is the last time you speak
to that man like that. Understand me?

68
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,000
This is embarrassing for me.

69
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,958
He's an intellectual.

70
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,750
Well, we have to do something.

71
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,416
You have to trust this man.
You have to respect him.

72
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,291
- You don't think I respect him?
- No!

73
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:17,250
[Berlin] No, no, no. The thing is,
maybe the kid's onto something.

74
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,708
If we print the bills at home,
we'd avoid a lot of problems,

75
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,375
and we don't have to spend
any money on guns

76
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,500
or ammunition. Right?

77
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,208
Denver, you bring us the printer,

78
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,416
and we'll download bills
from the internet.

Better yet...

83
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,375

and you can color them.

Because maybe I could
bust your fucking face in,

90
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,186
and then we could print some new teeth

to give my thanks to Palermo.

158
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,750
<i>His advice
on how to escape from my handcuffs</i>

159
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,708
<i>by dislocating my thumb
is what made me a free man.</i>

160
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,666
<i>Thanks to him,
I hope to be able to help all of you.</i>

161
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,166
Well, this will be fun.

162
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,583
Is that true?

163
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,916
If you prefer believing a psychopath
before a colleague, okay.

164
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,041
- That's your decision.
- [grunts]

165
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,375
Save your breath, you motherfucker.

166
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,625
[tense music playing]

167
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,642
- Mr. Denver, I need to use the bathroom.
- It's not a good time.

168
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,916
What I'm telling you is...

169
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,833
Is that I have a really bad stomach ache.

170
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,541
I need to go to the bathroom urgently.

171
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:18,916
What's wrong?

172
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,458
The museum is big.

173
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,375
And 60, 70 hostages
are difficult to control.

174
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,708
Those numbers could spark a rebellion.

175
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,208
No.

176
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,791
That would be suicide,
and under those circumstances,

177
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,555
what prevails
is the instinct to stay safe.

178
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:37,791
No.

179
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,208
Fear.

180
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,500
Fear and more fear
will allow them to make poor decisions,

181
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:46,000
like desperately attacking one of us
even if we're carrying M16s.

182
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,083
- What are you thinking?
- Infiltrate someone.

183
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:56,791
They wouldn't have any direct contact with
us except in case a rebellion breaks out.

184
00:09:56,875 --> 00:10:00,125
And if there aren't any problems,
they'll leave like the other hostages.

185
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,875
It‘s a job that even a smoking monkey
from Ringling Brothers could do.

186
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,208
Maybe even that Juanito guy could do it.
[chuckles]

187
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,083
That's it.

188
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:36,666
Is that him?

189
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,208
- No.
- No.

190
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,916
- Well, that was his bus.
- Yeah.

191
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:45,625
- This isn't good. We're leaving.
- No, Professor. Maybe he got confused.

192
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,166
[Moscow] Sure.
Or maybe he got out at a different stop.

193
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,750
Or maybe he fell asleep,
and he's still on the bus.

194
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,250
Godfather.

195
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,500
Jesus.

196
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:06,916
It's me.

197
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:09,625
Juanito?

198
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,125
Julia.

199
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,166
It's been a long time, no?

200
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,041
You look very beautiful, Julia.

201
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Well...

202
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,333
you were always handsome. Pretty.

203
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,125
Those eyes,

204
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,958
that mouth, that smile.

205
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,916
You're very beautiful, Julia.

206
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,208
[both chuckle]

207
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,458
Everything okay, Daniel?

208
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,208
You look freaked out.

209
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:46,708
No, I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.
I-I-I think it's really fucking great.

210
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,333
I mean, you know, everyone is free to do

211
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,458
whatever they want
and when they want it.

212
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,291
Well, then.

213
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:57,708
Well, it's just that I look in your eyes,
and you're still Juanito, but...

214
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,458
you're beautiful!

215
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,583
[all laugh]

216
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,958
Come here. Give me a hug.

217
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,041
[Julia] Okay.

218
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,500
Hey, does your father know?

219
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,166
'Cause I saw him a year ago,
and he said nothing.

220
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,583
My father's so supportive.

221
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,583
He always said he wanted a daughter,
so this worked out.

222
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,666
And who's this?

223
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,833
The boy with the plan, no?

224
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,166
The boy with the plan, yes.

225
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,458
And what are we doing for this heist?

226
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:37,000
Gandía's telling the truth. Palermo
helped him escape from his handcuffs.

227
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,476
- [Denver] How do you know?
- I saw him gesturing to his thumb.

228
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,708
They were talking. Palermo kept going
over to him the entire day.

229
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,059
- You didn't say anything?
- Because I couldn't hear them,

230
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,166
and I didn't know he'd tell him
to break his finger.

231
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,041
Then move closer! That's why you're here.

232
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:52,750
No, no, no, no. I'm here to keep an eye
on the hostages, not on the gang.

233
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,083
[Denver sighs]

234
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:57,875
[Denver] Uh...

235
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,458
You hear so much shit in here.

236
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:01,958
- Yeah, I know.
- Hm.

237
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
How's Nairobi?

238
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:07,000
Well, she's still recovering
as best as she can.

239
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,125
And Tokyo was abducted. Two down.

240
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:13,208
Hmm. Things are starting
to get a little fucked up, no?

241
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:14,791
Julia.

242
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,375
What do you want?

243
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,541
I want you to let me go, give me a weapon,
and let me join the others

244
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,825
'cause my ass is constantly asleep
from sitting on it...

245
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,476
They have think you're a hostage
in case things get more fucked up.

246
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,142
- More? It's gonna get worse?
- Quit fucking around and sit back down.

247
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,375
Jesus! Even Matías has a gun.

248
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,517
It's bigger than him.
He doesn't know how to hold it.

249
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,301
No, no. Just listen to me.
Orders are orders.

250
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,375
What you have to do
is go back to your place.

251
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,000
And the orders are given by you
because you're in charge here.

252
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,750
- Me? What do you mean I'm in charge?
- Of course you're in charge!

253
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:41,666
Nairobi's been shot.

254
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,791
Tokyo's been taken. Palermo...
Well, nobody could ever trust Palermo.

255
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,875
Do the math, Dani. You're next.
You're in charge.

256
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,041
You're really starting to piss me off.

257
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,166
So start giving orders.

258
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,500
It's easy. Give me a gun,
a vest and all the gear you have.

259
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,583
And...

260
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,208
start calling me Manila
because I'm Manila, Dani.

261
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:03,250
No, you're not Manila
because you're still a hostage.

262
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,750
And don't call me Dani. My name is Denver.

263
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:06,833
We're gonna go.

264
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,125
And I'll tell you something else.

265
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,750
Don't stare at me that way
because people are starting to notice.

266
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:13,916
[Julia] Stare at you?

267
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,791
I was sending you signals,
you fucking moron.

268
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:17,875
Stare at you!

269
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,833
[Tokyo sighs] Oh, fuck.
It feels like a fucking sauna.

270
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,333
Turn on the air-conditioning.

271
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,541
If I turn it on,
they'll know where we are.

272
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,500
- That would be a shame.
- It would.

273
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,291
We have so much to talk about.

274
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,250
Without the AC, there's not much oxygen,

275
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,416
so I suggest you ration your breathing.

276
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,291
Don't worry about me.

277
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:53,375
The people out there broke into
the vaults of the national reserve.

278
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,333
You think they won't find a way
into this bunker?

279
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:58,416
You're a dead man.

280
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,583
You're sweating.
May I open your jumpsuit?

281
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,625
We can't afford poor hygiene here.

282
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,208
Touch me and I'll rip your arm off,
motherfucker.

283
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,833
Oh, yeah?
What happened to that kid up there?

284
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,916
The one with the curly hair.

285
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,333
He's not making you horny?

286
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,708
Like an animal.

287
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,083
I really doubt that.

288
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,041
You're not into IT guys or kids.

289
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,666
I set up this heist for him.

290
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,791
What's the most
someone's ever done for you?

291
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,583
Give you a drill on Father's Day?

292
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,583
You're more into real men.

293
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,416
- Kinda like you?
- Mm-hmm. Like me.

294
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,333
That's right.

295
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,083
You've even stopped kicking me.

296
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,416
Because you've tied up my legs,
you fucking imbecile.

297
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,250
Well, whatever the reason,

298
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,791
the important thing is
you're much more receptive.

299
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,875
And you even painted your toes for me.

300
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,541
I love it.

301
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,916
[Professor]
<i>Is it true you helped Gandía escape?</i>

302
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,416
[Palermo] Yes, sir.

303
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,000
<i>And are you aware that he almost killed
Nairobi and Helsinki?</i>

304
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,125
- Collateral damage.
- Collateral damage?

305
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,208
- You are such a piece of shit.
- Relax.

306
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,916
Why did you do it, Palermo?

307
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,291
[Palermo] <i>Tokyo staged a </i>coup d'etát,<i> sir.</i>

308
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,750
I felt morally obligated...

309
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,958
to save the plan.

310
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,750
The plan is where my loyalty lies.
I had to restore the order

311
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,625
that was established because you never
relieved me in my position.

312
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,125

I don't care what's in the briefcase.
It doesn't make any difference.

You've put everyone in danger,

00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,666
and it's your fault that Gandía has taken
my officer in command as his prisoner.

332
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,833
Listen. I'm going to give you...
one opportunity to redeem yourself.

<i>But I won't forget what you've done.</i>

334

And, you'll never have your command back.

335
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,583
Then I'll go back to the hostages.

What should I do?

337

First, you shut your mouth.

Release him.

We have a murderer on the loose.
This is not the time to be divided.

[Palermo] We've brought you
to the library because,

472
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:14,375
as the old, well-known saying goes,
knowledge is power.

473
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:17,375
And in this case,
it might also save your lives.

that whoever finds it
and presses it firmly against their chest

478
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:32,250
will be able to deflect the bullets
from an M16.

It's a joke.

I'm joking. Calm down.

- Bogotá, are you afraid?
- Maybe the most.

00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,625
Palermo, Helsinki and Stockholm
are scared too.

They're taking the hostages

And Gandía...

Gandía is the most afraid, so he's
won't stop until he kills us all.

This is the easiest place to defend.

You can only get in from over there,

can shoot the shit out of him.

00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:31,250
Little friends from the gang,
please help me now!

632
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:41,375
The walls around you are made
of 70 centimeters of reinforced concrete.

633
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,958
It's like screaming on a submarine
in the middle of the sea.

634
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:55,291
The third card...

635
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,583
I spill blood.

636
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:02,750
I'm heading out for a bit.

637
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:08,125
[tense music building]

638
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:17,291
I was telling her about my
post-traumatic stress, moron.

639
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:19,875
- Shh.
- I wasn't stealing your girlfriend.

640
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:22,125
Talking to her just calms me down.

641
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:24,791
- You calm down when you talk to Stockholm?
- Yeah.

642
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:28,333
She's intelligent, sympathetic.
She listens.

643
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:31,208
She's kind.
You could talk to her about anything.

644
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:33,333
You could talk to me too,

645
00:35:33,416 --> 00:35:35,496
but you don't
because you're thinking with your dick!

646
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:46,291
I haven't been able to sleep for shit.

647
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:50,458
When I close my eyes,
I have nightmares, anxiety attacks,

648
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:52,166
tachycardia, sweating, man.

649
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,750
[Rio panting]

650
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:56,833
I was only able to sleep
if I knew she was next to me.

651
00:35:58,083 --> 00:35:59,583
Do you understand what I mean?

652
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:04,500
You're telling me you slept with her
to my face.

653
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:07,291
I didn't sleep with her, Denver.

654
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,458
She was keeping me company, okay?

655
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:17,375
Are you my fucking friend or not?

656
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:22,541
- Yes, I'm your friend.
- It doesn't sound like it, Rio.

657
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:28,625
[Denver] Motherfucker!

658
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:29,708
No, no, no, no!

659
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:30,791
[Rio] Your helmet!

660
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:32,458
Now your vest!

661
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:34,041
We've gotta push down on the grenade!

662
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:37,375
- Come on, Denver! With me!

- [Bogotá] <i>The freight elevator.</i>

666
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:49,291
We're fine. Where's Denver and Rio?

667
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:50,875
Denver, Rio.

668
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:53,916
- Denver, Rio!
- I'll do it. I'll go.

669
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,166
No. You stay here with the hostages.

670
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,666
Come on, Helsinki. Let's go.

[dramatic music playing]

672

Careful. That son of a bitch
is around here.

673
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,791
Bogotá, the explosion was in the elevator
on the first floor.

674
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:28,958
Copy that.

675
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,500
He could be close.

676
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:32,708
We're gonna stay here.

677

We've got you!

Are you okay?

[Palermo] Let me take a look.
Are you okay?

Okay?
