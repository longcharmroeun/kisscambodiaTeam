00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,833
Nobody. Nobody would break up with that.

157
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,083
What do you know about Tokyo?

158
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:44,041
Tokyo's a fucking Maserati,
and everyone wants a Maserati.

159
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,125
And if you take a Maserati,
leave it on the street,

160
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,791
doors open and keys in the ignition,

161
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,541
you've gotta be really fucked up.

162
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,125
Look, Rio...

163
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,875
I'm gonna make this really clear.

164
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,583
Maybe you're traumatized
'cause they screwed with your manhood.

165
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:03,250
Maybe they changed you
with the... the torture.

166
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:05,750
But you need to let it go.

167
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,208
That's why you broke up with Tokyo, huh?

168
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,291
If you were hurt by one person

169
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:13,416
or a group, the trauma is no different,
so let it go!

170
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,583
You can count on me.
I'm here to help with anything you need.

171
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,041
Anything.

172
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,541
Well, ladies and gentlemen...

173
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:44,041
I'm sorry to inform you
that I must say <i>au revoir.</i>

174
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,125
I'm leaving.

175
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,875
Keep up the good work. You're doing great.

176
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,166
What the fuck you think your doing?

177
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,333
Matías...

178
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:54,541
I'm leaving.

179
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,458
It's been a pleasure working with you,
as always.

180
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,625
And I would even say...

181
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,791
that I love you dearly, Matías.

182
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,291
As for you all,

183
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,833
I hope my leadership
hasn't been too traumatic.

184
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,583
But at least it'll be a fun story
for your loved ones,

185
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,125
your kids, your grandchildren, whatever.

186
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,666
Ladies and gentlemen,

187
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,208

Do I strike you as some sort of

What kind of orders
would I be giving down there? Let's see...

I didn't come in here for that bullshit!
I'm not in the mood for this. I'm leaving.

If I stay, I'll rain down bullets on you,

Because, I swear,
the next thing I’m gonna do...

216

is blow your fuckin' head off.

217
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:00,583
I don't think so.

I do think so.

Claymore mines.

00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,333
As you can see,

they're pointed in your direction.

222
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,125
I'll be fine over here.

223
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,458
You know that I don't give a shit
if I have to kill you.

[Palermo] Relax.

[Tokyo] You won't betray us like that.

To jail?

To betray your friends?

00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,208
I'm not selling anyone out.

My safe passage is right here.
State secrets.

I'm not gonna betray you.

Well, you're gonna have to kill me.

Can you please tell me
what you said to Rio?

- About what?
- Did you tell him he's traumatized?

[Denver]
Call it trauma or whatever you want.

- Something is wrong with him.
- Something's wrong?

260
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,375
Why? Because he left Tokyo, no?
And she's a Maserati.

Okay, hang on.

The Maserati thing
was just the way guys talk.

263

What really matters

264
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,791
is that after the torture,
something happened to him.

265
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,541
I think they changed him.

266
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,041
They did what?

00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,666

Forty sweaty guys opened his back door.

- [sighs]
- They combed him inside.

Rio is dealing with being tortured,
and you feed him all that bullshit?

270
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,309
All that bullshit is true. I asked him
if they forced him to do things.

271
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,083
Know what he did? He was quiet.

272
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,375
He was quiet because it's true.
A textbook case.

You can’t what?

I said Tokyo was a Maserati,
that doesn't mean you're a used car.

Um, no? Well, forget it.
Just keep your mouth shut.

- And I don't defend myself?
- No.

296

Because you don't even know
what she's angry about.

00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,791
You shut up,

298
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,208
and the less you know
what she's talking about,

00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,291
the more sorry you look.

300
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:20,958
All you say is,

301
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,708
"yes" and "I am sorry, my love."

302

- Sounds like a textbook for pussies.

You wait for the storm to pass,

305
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,875
and then, when you figure out
where the wind is coming from,

306
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,583
and when she seems to be calmed down,

307
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:40,041
well, then and only then...

308

you make a move.

00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,375
She's been mad at me since the monastery.

That's what's going on.

- Well...
- Yeah.

00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,416
We dragged it all here.

314
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:57,500
And because of the pressure
from the heist, it all explodes.

317
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,500
<i>It's Tokyo.</i>

318
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:29,416
- Tokyo, you just staged a coup d'état.
<i>- Palermo's gone crazy.</i>

319
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,000
He was about to explode
the main operation room,

320
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:35,166
<i>- but I have it under control.</i>
- No, you don't.

321
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,416
You can't control Palermo
because he's unpredictable.

322
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,666
He's tied up
and under 24-hour surveillance.

323
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,083
Tokyo, the whole plan is falling apart!

324
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,416
I'm still here... Professor.

325
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,125
So what if you’re still there, Tokyo?

326
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,166
<i>Without Palermo, we are incapable
of getting the gold out,</i>

327
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,570
<i>or do you know how to do it, huh?</i>

328
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,041
And without Nairobi!

329
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,125
And without Lisbon!

330
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,291
[sentimental music]

331
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:16,583
[Professor] <i>Palermo was escaping
because it's the only smart move left.</i>

332
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:19,375
Professor...

333
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,833
<i>you've always been my guardian angel.</i>

334
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,583
Now it's my turn.

335
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:29,666
How did it happen?

336
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,625
She died so she could protect me.

337
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:35,666
I'm really so sorry.

338
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,291
<i>I...</i>

339
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,333
was camouflaged in a tree,
and there were...

340
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,375
There were soldiers,
and police were everywhere.

341
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,916
<i>And she was in a farm.
That’s where they found her.</i>

342
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,333
<i>They made her kneel down,
unarmed, and they asked about me.</i>

343
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,291
<i>And I ran and ran, and...</i>

344
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,750
They asked her, "Where's the Professor?"

345
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,541
I said, "Tell them, Raquel.

346
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,625
Tell them where I am.

347
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,583
Tell them I'll surrender. Please."

348
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,250
<i>"I don't know."</i>

349
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,041
<i>She repeated, "I don't know."</i>

350
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,208
<i>And they shot her two times.</i>

351
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,208
She was unarmed,
and they shot her two times.

352
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,500
I couldn't make it on time.

353
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:41,916
<i>But did you see it?</i>

354
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:43,541
No.

355
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:44,833
You only heard it?

356
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:49,791
Professor, did you see them move the body?

357
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,208
I had to run.

358
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,291
<i>Listen to me.</i>

359
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,583
I also heard my mother
telling me to come home,

360
00:21:56,666 --> 00:22:01,000
<i>that I'd be safe there, but there were
20 cops waiting for me in her kitchen.</i>

361
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:02,666
And in the tent,

362
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,541
they also heard us escaping from the bank.

363
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:08,916
<i>But we're still here.</i>

364
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:12,333
<i>The only one that got out
was the little ferret with a jumpsuit.</i>

365
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,416
<i>Did they publish anything?</i>

366
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,375
Nothing.

367
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:22,666
Just like with Rio.

368
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,333
If they really killed her, we'd know.

369
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,458
She's being interrogated.

370
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:40,000
- Where you going, Professor?
- To the Bank of Spain.

371
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,666
No, no, no.
It's not a good idea. It’s too risky.

372
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:46,083
I appreciate your concern,
but it's the only place

373
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,791
where I can find out
if my wife is still alive. Move.

374
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,375
- No!
- I'm asking you nicely.

375
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:51,750
- No!
- Step aside, Marseille...

376
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:55,000
I won't allow you
to get on the motorbike.

377
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,958
[dramatic music]

378
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:06,541
[Sierra] Seventy.

379
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,708
With what we have in those files,

380
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:14,088
you'll be 70 years old
when you get out of jail.

381
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:16,375
And Paula 40.

382
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,333
And your mother
will have been dead so long

383
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:21,708
- you won't even be able to find her grave.
- Just stop.

384
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,541
You don't have to do that.

385
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:26,875
The years are up to the prosecution,
not you,

386
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,291
and the conviction by the judge.

387
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:32,875
You know very well

388
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:36,833
that the prosecutor and the judge
are gonna work...

389
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,291
based on what I write in these reports.

390
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,458
And I can write whatever I want.

391
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,708
What would you like me to write?

392
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,541
Are you going to force me
to resort to violence?

393
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:53,416
- I’m only protecting the plan.
- I decide the plan!

394
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,125
That's not the plan.
That's an improvisation.

395
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:59,208
And like you always said,
no improvisation.

396
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:01,041
I won't give in.

397
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:04,541
I want you to understand
that I need to be there.

398
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:07,333
The only place I can get answers
is the Bank of Spain.

399
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,125
Very well.

400
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,833
Seriously, Professor? Huh?

401
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:19,708
I don't know where the Professor is,
or what he'll do.

402
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,333
You have no ideas?

403
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:25,458
Has love made you dim or something?

404
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,333
The plan has different types of firewalls.

405
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,750
This is nothing to do with our love.

406
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:34,083
[Sierra] Of course it does.
Think about it.

407
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,166
In jail, love drains like sewer water.

408
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,041
<i>It happens very fast.</i>

409
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:40,875
<i>In two months, it's already dry.</i>

410
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:43,415
<i>Two months of suffering,
or your whole life in jail?</i>

411
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,083
Hmm?

412
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:48,083
If you were reincarnated seven times,

413
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:51,333
you'd never understand
the nature of our love.

414
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:52,708
To protect the plan,

415
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,500
we need to know
if she is there and under interrogation

416
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:58,625
because if she is, that means
Alicia Sierra is interrogating my wife,

417
00:24:58,708 --> 00:25:01,000
and that is taking place
at the Bank of Spain!

418
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:02,958
But you can't go!

419
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:07,541
Allow me to tell you
about the real nature of your love.

420
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:09,916
One in Soto del Real,
and the other in Cádiz,

421
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,500
waiting for a conjugal visit once a year.

422
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:15,708
And that's if you’re lucky
because if we don't catch your sweetheart,

423
00:25:15,791 --> 00:25:18,666
<i>then you'll never see him again
in your fucking life.</i>

424
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,750
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

425
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:23,333
Either that or actually have the time
to raise to your daughter.

426
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:26,250
You're not trying
to fuck with my emotions, Alicia.

427
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:27,916
I'm just telling you the truth.

428
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:30,083
Like I always do.

429
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:33,416
We need to go to the Bank of Spain.

430
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,375
And how are you gonna get to the tent
if your face is all over the news, huh?

431
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:40,416
Just like everyone else.

432
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:43,666
Dressed in red with a face of Dalí.

433
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:46,000
Good. Good.

434
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:49,541
She... She won't betray us.

435
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:50,750
Give me your hand.

436
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:56,000
Give me your hand.

437
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:02,291
How many of your old relationships
feel completely meaningless now?

438
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:08,833
The same thing will happen with this one,

439
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:10,375
and you know it.

440
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:20,208
Everyone could betray me, Marseille.
Everyone.

441
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:22,131
- It's just a matter of...
- [Professor groans]

442
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,791
What the hell? You hit me!
Weren't we finished?

443
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:29,333
We were?

444
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:31,125
I didn't know.

445
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:33,208
[sighs]

446
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,250
[singing in Italian]

447
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:17,166
Sergio, come on.

448
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,708
- Just drink a little bit more.
- I had two already.

449
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:24,125
- This is a strange wedding, Andrés.
- This is so great!

450
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:25,601
- I don’t think so.
- Little brother!

451
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,934
I feel sorry for her because she's young
and she's in love,

452
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:29,833
and if you remember, you have a disease.

453
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:31,833
Didn't you hear the priest, hmm?

454
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,833
"Till death do you part."

455
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:38,309
Andrés, fine. Maybe for you,
this is the grand finale, but for her,

456
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:41,708
it's the beginning, and this beginning
is not fair. It just isn’t.

457
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:44,541
My God! She knows about my illness.

458
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:46,458
Everyone knows about my illness.

459
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:48,791
You are betraying her feelings.

460
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,666
[laughs]

461
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:54,125
I’m gonna give her the best
two or three years of her entire life.

462
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:55,583
Yes, yes, and after that...

463
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:58,166
Yes, I guess I'll somehow betray her.

464
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:00,833
Anyway,

465
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:03,000
betrayal is an inherent part of love.

466
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:06,041
Since we're on the subject, look at him!

467
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:08,291
Martín.

468
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:11,625
So loyal! My best friend. Happy.

469
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:12,833
Would he betray me?

470
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:14,666
[Berlin] Hmm?

471
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:16,708
Of course, he would.

472
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:19,375
He just needs the right circumstances.
Tatiana?

473
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,583

No. What I'm saying is that

betrayal doesn't depend on how much
or deeply you love someone.

It depends on the magnitude

I'm gonna ask you
a very simple question, Raquel.

Do you deserve to spend
