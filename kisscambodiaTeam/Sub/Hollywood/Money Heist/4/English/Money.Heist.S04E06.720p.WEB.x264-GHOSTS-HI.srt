Before you scattered us all across

this gang...

47
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:15,000

You know, I...

52
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,791
I had already given up on the idea...

53
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,000
of having a family.

54
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,541
Completely given it up.

But now I think
there's another way of doing this thing.

56

I have this urge to be a mother.

57
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,833
But a different one.
I wanna have a bunch of kids,

58

Would you be the father of my child?

- I mean...
- Pardon?

63
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,916
I need to get good genes
to combine with mine. It's very important.

64

I look at you in class,

65
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,291

66
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,500
"This man is brilliant,

67
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,208
and he's honorable,

68
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,041

69
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,458
He's a man with ideals."

70
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,125

71

And honorable...

73
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:49,083

74
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,291
that's impossible.

I'm not one
who doesn't develop attachments.

84
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,166

00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,333
the fact that I have a child out there
somewhere in the world.

- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

You were the one that built this family.
And you...

You said, "Whatever it takes."

90

- What I'm asking you is the same.

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,916
Because a family is there for you,
no questions asked.

but I also have a plan.

95
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,250
You've taught me
that we have to help each other

96
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,000
because that's who we are.

to do more complicated things.

00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,458
A little bit more, yeah.

100
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:21,458
And...

101
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,041
I've done fucked up shit for you
without asking.

102
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,791
I know. I've asked you...

103
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,666
to take big risks.

104
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,416
Serious risks.

105
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,750
In fact, much more
than what you're asking me now.

106
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,083
Are you saying that's a yes?

107

00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,625
[Julia scoffs]

315
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:57,333
What's up, Daniel?

316
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,601
- I was in the middle of my meal...
- No, no. Not Daniel.

317
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,708
Not Daniel. Here... Here, I'm Denver.

318
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,000
Okay? Denver.

319
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:06,291
I'm sorry. It's hard to get used
to your new identity. I'm sorry.

320
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,375
Hmm. Well, that, uh...

321
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,250
- Look, there's just a couple of things...
- Mm-hmm.

322
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,166
...that I'd like to understand,
and it's not easy for me.

323
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,333
[Julia laughs softly]

324
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,250
Ask away.
I'm the same person I've always been.

325
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:23,416
Well, not exactly the same person
because now you've got tits.

326
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,291
- Hmm, well...
- Yeah, you've got tits.

327
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,208
- I got tits. Mm-hmm.
- You're a woman.

328
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,000
That part is already clear for me.

329
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,000
Are you gay too?
Or how does that stuff work?

330
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:41,500
So, what you're worried about right now
is knowing whether I'm into guys or not?

331
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,750
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

332
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,625
Hmm. Well, I like men. It's true, yeah.

333
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,833
- I like them a lot, actually.
- Right. Okay.

334
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,583
But hang on.
I don't like just any kind of man.

335
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:56,083
Um, I like them strong, you know?
I like gym rats.

336
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:59,750
Punks, but they have to read
a little bit too so I can learn from them.

337
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,250
Um... They have to watch football.
I like that.

338
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,833
But they have to watch like a true macho,
you know,

339
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,416
with a beer in their hand
and their legs spread wide open...

340
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,583
Okay, okay. I got it already.
I got it. It's crystal clear.

341
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:11,958
Have you...

342
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,375
Have you always liked men,

343
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,791
or did this happen
after you became a woman?

344
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:17,875
First of all,

345
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,666
I've always been a woman.

346
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
No.

347
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,250
You haven't always been a woman.
I saw you rob gas stations.

348
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,500
- You weren't a woman.
- How does a woman rob?

349
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,875
Do they scratch people
and pull their hair?

350
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:32,083
I'm not a Neanderthal.
What I'm talking about, it's just that,

351
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,583
usually you can tell it's a woman.
You can tell.

352
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,833
I went on all these robberies
with Juanito, not a woman.

353
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:41,166
Right?
Maybe this thing about being a woman...

354
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,000
happened later.

355
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,000
Let me tell you something.

356
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:51,375
When Juanito
got out of a robbery with you,

357
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,791
- he'd go back home into his room.
- Yeah.

358
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,833
He'd put on a little music.

359
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,625
- He'd roll a little joint...
- [laughs]

360
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:04,416
...and put on some red lipstick.
Italian lipstick. It looked wonderful.

361
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,416
Ferrari red.
And he'd take his little joint,

362
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,250
and he'd lie down on the bed...

363
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,416
and right there in that moment...

364
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:18,333
alone, relaxed, looking gorgeous...

365
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:19,416
[laughs]

366
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,625
...that was the moment I was me, for real.

367
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,041
You've always been a woman.

368
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:28,208
Always.

369
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,166
And I never realized.

370
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:34,416
Do you know
who made me really horny back then?

371
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,250
[laughs] Of course I know.

372
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,458
- Yeah?
- Of course I do.

373
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,833
David Beckham.
You talked about him all day.

374
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:45,333
- Fucking David Beckham.
- Beckham, too. I mean, he's sexy, but no.

375
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:46,833
Um, you.

376
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,166
You turn me on so much.

377
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,875
I didn't turn you on at all.

378
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,838
- I was in love with you.
- What are you saying?

379
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,375
- You don't mess around with love.
- Think about it.

380
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:02,142
Why do you think I was with you
all day long, doing jobs or whatever?

381
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:03,166
To be close to you.

382
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:05,833
- Are you being serious?
- Of course. What do you mean?

383
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:09,101
I'd grope you all the time on the bike.
I touched you all day, you never noticed.

384
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,333
- I'd touch your leg, your back...
- Stop.

385
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:13,336
- And your smell!
- Wait a second! Okay, hold on.

386
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:16,541
Do you even realize what you're saying?
This is really serious.

387
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:18,250
You were taking advantage of me.

388
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:21,916
I'm screwing with you, moron.

389
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,541
- [Julia] It's just...
- Mother...

390
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,166
Motherfucker!

391
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:27,291
Come on. Give me a hug.

392
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,416
I'm sorry, sir,
but I'm not gonna piss myself.

393
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,666
Nobody move!
I don't wanna hear a fuckin' sound! Hey!

394
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:51,583
[Matías] Hey!

395
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,708
[Arturo] Miguel... Miguel, listen.

396
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:59,000
We need to figure out a way
to communicate safely with the outside.

397
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:00,083
You get it?

398
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,750
Take it. Hide it.

399
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:05,000
Keep it. They'll always
be suspicious of me, but not you.

400
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:14,958
- What are you doing here?
- [Julia] What the fuck?

401
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:17,875
What's happening? Where's Denver?

402
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,541
- Denver's fine.
- [Gandía] Who's there?

403
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,625
- [Helsinki] It's a hostage.
- Get her out now, Matías!

404
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:26,166
- Let's go.
- Fuck, no. I'm staying. Give me a gun.

405
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,500
That's not why you're here, Manila.
Get going.

406
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,708
You guys are in trouble. Give me a pistol.

407
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:36,166
Get out of here right now.

408
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:37,750
Let's fucking go.

409
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:39,958
It's okay.

410
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,916
Look, from this moment on,

411
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,708
you and I are gonna be
the main part of the resistance.

412
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:55,248
I'm gonna have a heart attack
just listening to you.

413
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,333
[Rio] <i>Denver.</i>

414
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:11,833
<i>It'll take four seconds at most.</i>

415
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:15,541
One goes for it.
The other stays and covers.

416
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:16,625
<i>And we save Nairobi.</i>

417
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:18,458
[Palermo] <i>Gandía. What do you want?</i>

418
00:25:18,541 --> 00:25:20,416
<i>- Let's negotiate.
- </i>[Gandía] <i>Negotiate?</i>

419
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:22,625
Look, let me explain the situation.

420
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:24,125
Option one:

421
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:27,666
I come out of this room with the gun
pointed at Nairobi's head.

422
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:31,166
<i>All of you stay back
against the wall on the right.</i>

423
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,791
<i>I let her go, and nobody dies.</i>

424
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:37,375
<i>It's a good deal for both sides.
Zero-zero. A tie.</i>

425
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:39,125
<i>Option number two:</i>

426
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:42,375
<i>instead of me going out, you come in.</i>

427
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,708
I blow Nairobi's head off her neck.

428
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:46,625
<i>You shoot me.</i>

429
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:49,291
I'd still have another hand left
to shoot at you,

430
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:52,541
and I swear to God, I'm gonna take
more than one of you with me.

431
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:54,041
You forgot option three.

432
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:57,791
<i>You come out on your knees, unarmed,
and surrender and give us Nairobi.</i>

433
00:25:57,875 --> 00:25:59,875
That's also a tie. What do you think?

434
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,583
I wouldn't kneel down,
not even before God Almighty.

435
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:05,666
<i>I'll give you one minute.
After that, I'll start shooting.</i>

436
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,500
<i>- And I'll score at least six-zero.</i>
- [laughing]

437
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:10,583
[Nairobi] <i>You fucking moron!</i>

438
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:13,125
Gandía,
you're not getting out of this alive.

439
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:16,750
[laughing] You're a fucking clown.
The other day...

440
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:21,250
when Tokyo and I broke in,
we made you look like such an idiot.

441
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:22,583
- Shut up.
- [Nairobi laughs]

442
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,416
And Tokyo... [laughs]

443
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,000
...used the dumbest fucking trick
with the water.

444
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,958
Shut your fucking mouth right now.

445
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:30,916
[Nairobi] You fucking ate

446
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,750
- the door handle.
- [Gandía] Shut up!

447
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:34,458
You got knocked out so hard...

448
00:26:34,541 --> 00:26:36,458
- [Nairobi laughs]
- What is she doing?

449
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:40,416
What happened
to your little macho balls then, huh?

450
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:44,000
- [Nairobi laughs] So amateur.
- She wants to save Tokyo.

451
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:45,958
You're useless! [laughs]

452
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:48,375
She knows that if he kills her,
we'll kill him.

453
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:52,125
[Nairobi] You've been training for this
your whole fucking life, right?

454
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:54,583
<i>You had all your little soldier friends,</i>

455
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:57,541
then two girls show up and make a fool
of you like that.

456
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,250
- Want me to shoot you right now?
- Surprise me.

457
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:03,291
How about I put a bullet up your asshole?

458
00:27:08,916 --> 00:27:09,916
[inhales sharply]

459
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
[grunts]

460
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,500
We have to get her out.
We have to get her out now.

461
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:20,625
If we let him get out of there,

462
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:23,791
<i>he's gonna do whatever he wants.
I don't trust his word,</i>

463
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:26,583
- we have to be patient.
- [Bogotá] <i>Fuck your patience.</i>

464
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:29,708
<i>She's in there because of you.
You helped him get free.</i>

465
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:31,375
<i>We have to get her out.</i>

466
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:33,166
<i>Everyone agree?</i>

467
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:38,916
Okay, Gandía.

468
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:41,000
<i>We're gonna let you out.</i>

469
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,041
Okay. Very good.

470
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:45,000
<i>This is how it's gonna go...</i>

471
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:47,208
<i>You'll be seeing Nairobi the entire time.</i>

472
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:51,291
We're gonna walk forward together
as I point my gun against her head,

473
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:55,333
<i>until she confirms everyone's standing
against the wall in the corridor,</i>

474
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:59,333
starting with
those two little fucking kids up there!

475
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:02,833
Denver, Rio, hear that?

476
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:05,416
- <i>You have to come down here.</i>
- Okay, okay, okay.

477
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:22,416
Earlier, you asked me if my husband
was too disgusted to sleep with me,

478
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,541
and I didn't answer.

479
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:25,291
Well, no.

480
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:27,791
I didn't disgust him. [chuckles]

481
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,208
Because I wasn't a bitch back then.

482
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:39,541
But now I guess I am.

483
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,041
And yeah, we had sex.

484
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:44,458
We did it everywhere.

485
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:47,833
And it's fascinating how creative we were.

486
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:52,500
I imagine you and the Professor are more
like a once a month kind of couple, right?

487
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:53,916
And always missionary.

488
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,541
Money can't buy it all.

489
00:28:56,416 --> 00:29:00,166
All that poison inside of you
is eating you away, Alicia.

490
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:02,208
I can see it in your face.

491
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,291
What's wrong? My face?

492
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:13,458
You're not yourself.
All this talk about sex. What's wrong?

493
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:14,666
Is it the hormones?

494
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,916
I don't know. Download an app.

495
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,666
There's a million perverts
who'd like to fuck a pregnant lady.

496
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,875
I prefer getting to know the other person.

497
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:25,000
I don't date the first geek
that I meet at a bar

498
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:27,416
that gives me his phone and says...
[panting]

499
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,750
"Hey, gorgeous. Why don't you come with me
to my warehouse

500
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:33,000
and taste my cider?
It's really tasty."

501
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:34,750
You know what your problem is?

502
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:37,750
- Tell me.
- If your mask crumbles,

503
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:39,125
everything else does.

504
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:42,250
You're a step away from a breakdown.

505
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:43,625
And I get it. I get...

506
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:48,083
I'm not the one with a mask on.

507
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:52,083
Let's see. Earlier, hmm,
the two of us had a deal.

508
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,041
You were holding the phone,

509
00:29:54,916 --> 00:29:56,291
then you changed your mind.

510
00:29:57,583 --> 00:29:58,625
What happened?

511
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:03,083
I made you waste your time
while you were questioning me.

512
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:06,625
I pretended you were breaking me
little by little

513
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:08,333
and that I was about to give in.

514
00:30:08,416 --> 00:30:12,000
In the meantime, he slipped
through your fingers. He escaped.

515
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:14,833
It's called diversion tactics,

516
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,416
and it worked well.

517
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,416
You know what I think?

518
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:24,333
Your little shepherd somehow found a way
to make it here in time.

519
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:29,083
I'll find out how.

520
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:31,458
You'll see.

521
00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:39,750

- </i>[Rio] <i>I knew we weren't in Spain.</i>

524
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:51,791
<i>I heard the prayer call from a mosque.</i>

525
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:54,208
[Berlin] <i>Think. You know how.</i>

526
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:56,208
<i>Fly with me.</i>

527
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:07,666
Shakir.

528
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:09,875
[professor]<i> Shakir, do you hear me?</i>

529
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,833
Yes. This is Shakir. Go ahead, Professor.

530
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:15,208
I need you to track
Rio's airplane to Spain.

531
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:16,875
It's a Beechcraft Air King 250.

532
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,666
<i>Property of the Spanish Air Force.</i>

533
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,333
The flight landed at exactly 4:30 p.m.
on April 4th.

534
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:24,333
<i>Look for that plane
in every navigation satellite.</i>

535
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,625
<i>I need you to find
the exact point of origin.</i>

536
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:34,458
[Arturo] Does it have battery?

537
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:37,708
- It does.
- And reception?

538
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:42,833
[Miguel] Yes, sir.

539
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:44,541
Okay. Go to outgoing calls.

540
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:48,333
Miguel, for fuck's sake.
You need to keep a cool head

541
00:31:48,416 --> 00:31:51,208
You understand me?
You are never going to be suspicious.

542
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:54,083
- But my fingers are really sweaty.
- Then calm down!

543
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,708
[Miguel] There's one call.
A private number.

544
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:02,833
- Go to contacts.
- [Miguel breathes heavy]

545
00:32:03,916 --> 00:32:05,000
[Miguel] There's a number.

546
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:07,458
Call it.

547
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:10,625
Oh, God. Please don't answer.

548
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,125
INCOMING CALL

549
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:15,500
It's the phone we gave to Nairobi.

550
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:17,916
[beeping]

551
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,892
- [Arturo] What are you doing?
- I'm not talking.

552
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:21,791
- [Arturo] Fuck!
- They called and hung up.

553
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:26,208
I'm leaving my fingerprints.
I don't wanna call the police!

554
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:27,125
Listen.

555
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:29,750
All you have to do
is leave the phone connected.

556
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:33,166
Then you talk to me casual.
A normal conversation between hostages.

557
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,375
When they hear it,
they'll know what to do.

558
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:37,083
You got it?

559
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,250
[dramatic music playing]

560
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,125

00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:50,166
here we are...

<i>in the library.</i>

565
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:55,250
<i>All together, and we're just being
watched by one of them.</i>

566
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:57,750
<i>Random guy. I think his name's Matías.</i>

567
00:32:57,833 --> 00:33:00,791
- Turn the volume all the way up.
- I think it's Arturo Román.

568
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:02,875
No one's in the hall, right, Miguel?

569
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:04,416
[loudly] There's nobody.

570
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:09,791
- [whispers] I can't use my voice, sir.
- Ssh!

571
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:11,875
And now since that guy escaped, Gandía,

572
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:15,000
<i>I think it'd be the perfect time
for the police to come in</i>

<i>because, I repeat,</i>

574
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:18,583
there's no one in the main hall.

575
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:21,958
<i>Thank God we're okay. We're scared.
There was a shooting, a grenade,</i>

00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,375
screaming, even religious chants.
It's nuts. Right, Miguel?

577
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:27,541
- [loudly] That's right.
- [Miguel coughs]

I'm sorry. [coughs]

[Miguel coughs and pants]

We need to go in. Fuck!

The President doesn't want any
armored vans to approach the bank.

582
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:40,458
For fuck's sake! They're not looking.
We'll catch them off guard.

583
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:42,166
I can't do it!

584

What are you guys doing?

585
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:47,458
It's this kid.
He's lost it. He's really nervous.

586
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:49,208
Poor little guy. He was praying.

587
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:51,666
- I think so. What do I know?
- Come here.

588
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:56,041
Sit over here and be quiet,
nice and close to me.

589
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:58,625
Raise your hands where I can see them.

590
00:33:58,708 --> 00:34:03,291
If you lower them an inch, I'll shoot you.
If you move an inch, I'll shoot you.

591
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:06,458
And if you say even one fucking word...

592
00:34:06,541 --> 00:34:08,666
- You'll shoot me.
- Yes, I'll shoot you.

593
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,416
- I'm thinking about shooting you anyway.
- Copy.

594
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,041
Ssh. Quiet.

595
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:20,250
Suarez, get an intervention unit ready.
We're going in through the main hall.

596
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:23,041
And Call Gandía in the panic room
so we can coordinate.

I didn't think you had any balls.

That's minutes before

<i>I can see the whole area is a desert.
There's no trees,</i>

607
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:09,708
so we should be able to trace it
through the satellite

608
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:11,833
- and find where the car came from.
- <i>Okay.</i>

I can't fly with weapons.

613

I know. Once you get there,
everything will be ready.

- The plan has just changed, Marseille.
