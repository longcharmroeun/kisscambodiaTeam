And you know that
because you've seen his diary,

or did he confess it to you in tears,

reasonably.

He's completely objective.
He's an engineer.

It's the biggest heist of my life,
and I want my brother to be there.

Well, maybe that's because
one of the principal themes of romanticism

136
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,208
is suicide. Andres, this plan is suicide.

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,208
I kept seeing flashes of it.
I woke up, and my bra was torn.

00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:16,333
Amanda!

472
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:20,125
What's happening here
is you're very nervous,

473
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:21,833
- and that's normal...
- No.

474

- ...'cause of this insanity, right?
- No.

475
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:25,916
I'm sure you're confused.
You saw some flashes,

476
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,500
and you believe those flashes,
but they didn't actually really happen.

477
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:31,750
Or maybe... maybe...

478
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:33,666
you had an erotic dream about me.

479
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,583
A wet dream.

480
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,958
It's natural. I don't mind being
the object of your desire, but...

I didn't take advantage of you.

488

You're accusing me
of something very, very serious.

You were scared. You had a panic attack.

I'm a colonel

I stand before you at the request
of the Minister of the Interior

of Anibal Cortés,

At this time,

All I can say is that she was taken down
during a skirmish

for the Bank of Spain

Was Cortés illegally detained in Panama?

The arrest was made
in compliance with the law,

541
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:47,291
in accordance
with an international order for his arrest

- officially issued by Europol.
- [clamoring]

Is that true?

No rule of law
and no democratic country in the world

would allow something like that to happen.

He claims to have been buried alive.

Do you deny that too?

549
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:06,708
That he was left to defecate himself?

They'll be overconfident.

They'll be completely overconfident

it's their word against ours.

is less intelligent than us.

Okay, listen up, everyone.

626
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:07,791
I need everybody out,
except for the essential personnel.

627
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:09,666
Take a breather, have a coffee,

628
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,916
and in five minutes,
we'll get back to work.

629
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:19,416
Oh, Alicia. [sighs]

630
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:22,541
We tried to get out there and deny it...

631
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,208
but that damn Professor
was waiting for us

632
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:28,625
with the evidence in his hands.

633
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:33,791
Now the only way out
is by taking the blame.

634
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,625
And who's gonna do that?

635
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,750
For the CNI, Prieto.

636
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:44,250
For the police, you.

637
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:50,791
We need you to act as a firewall
so that the institutions come out clean.

638
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:57,708
What do I do? What do I say?

639
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:01,083
You want me to tell them
I did it all by myself?

640
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:02,541
That it was...

641
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:05,041
a professional endeavor?

642
00:39:05,916 --> 00:39:08,916
To see if they'd give me a medal
for police merit?

643
00:39:09,541 --> 00:39:12,708
They've got Prieto's e-mails,
so they probably have yours.

644
00:39:13,791 --> 00:39:16,166
You have to confess,
resign from the heist.

645
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:18,750
And...

646
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:21,541
take the blame
for all of the illegal acts.

647
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,000
Since I'm going down,

648
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:27,416
why don't we add stuff
and say I killed Manolete and Kennedy,

649
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,041
the 23F.

650
00:39:29,583 --> 00:39:30,833
I shot the Pope.

651
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:33,958
Yeah, might as well go for everything, no?

652
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:36,791
Shit's gonna hit the fan
in every possible scenario.

653
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,458
But if you help us, we won't forget
about what you did for us.

654
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:43,708
I'll have the CNI discredit the evidence.

655
00:39:43,791 --> 00:39:46,666
The state attorney
and the prosecution are on our side.

656
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:49,458
You'll be put with a judge
who's favorable to you.

657
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:52,750
Someone who owes us.
Someone who we have by the balls.

658
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:54,313
Granted, you won't get your job back,

659
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:55,583
but don't worry about it

660
00:39:55,666 --> 00:39:58,186
because we'll make sure
you're getting paid from a reserve fund.

661
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:05,458
I promise you,
you will not set foot in prison.

662
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:06,791
That's fucking bullshit.

663
00:40:13,708 --> 00:40:15,125
[sighs] Well...

664
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:19,500
I guess I don't have any other choice.

665
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:22,583
Right?

666
00:40:23,916 --> 00:40:24,916
Alicia...

667
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:26,958
be strong.

668
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:29,416
We're with you on this.

669
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:43,583
Sierra...

670
00:40:43,666 --> 00:40:45,166
and Colonel Prieto.

671
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:50,083
They're going to be
the first ones to fall.

672
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:52,083
And why?

673
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:55,208
Because that's how we'll cripple the tent,

674
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:58,416
and then, we can protect
all of our people inside of the bank.

675
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:01,333
Tamayo will barely be able
to keep control.

676
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,333
When everyone's properly protected
inside the bank,

677
00:41:04,416 --> 00:41:06,791
- what are we gonna do, Benjamín?
- Huh? Maybe...

678
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,750
You tell me.

679
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:13,041
We'll rescue another member of the gang.

680
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:14,125
[claps]

681
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:16,541
We're going to rescue someone

682
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:20,750
held in custody
by a convoy of 26 police officers.

683
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:25,333
- [Benjamín] That's impossible, Professor.
- It's almost impossible,

684
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:28,500
but there is one possibility...

685
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:30,750
if we can answer the following:

686
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:35,666
Where are they going transfer her
and when?

687
00:41:36,416 --> 00:41:38,750
And we'll know that information...

688
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:43,125
because I'm gonna make
the transfer happen.

689
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:35,875
Just the one on your neck left.

690
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,041
How does it look?

691
00:42:40,666 --> 00:42:41,750
It doesn't look good.

692
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:46,083
If I pull it out wrong,
you could be paralyzed.

693
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:49,375
Pull it out. Pull it out. Don't hesitate.
