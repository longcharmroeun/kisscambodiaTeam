[Berlin] Hmm.

166
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,825
I presume you're
the chief of security for the governor.

167
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,083
Affirmative.

168

[clock chimes]

169
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,333
In some ways,

170
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,125
you and I are in the same line of work.

171
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,833
We both analyze the risks.

172
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,125
I think we're very alike, don’t you?

173
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:32,541
No.

174
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,583
We're not alike at all.

175
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,541
I analyze risks
so I can save peoples lives.

176
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:40,875
You do it to make money.

177
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,708
It's not the same.

178
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,416
See, we are alike.

179
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,541
You also seem perceptive and very...

180
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,291
observant.

181
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:00,708
What risks do you see here
at this exact moment in this room?

182
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,125
Purely out of curiosity.

183
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:05,125
If I had seen any risks in this room,

184
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,708
they'd have been gone already.

185
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,750
You understand that.

186
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,833
[footsteps approaching]

187
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:13,916
Mr. Kesmann.

188
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,791
- How do you do.
- How are you?

189
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,708
- Very well, thank you.
- Shall we sit?

190
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:18,916
Yes, please.

191
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,250
Would you care for a coffee, Mr Kesmann?

192
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,458
Well, a black Ceylon tea
with cardamom would be incredible.

193
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,500
- If not, any black tea's fine. Thank you.
- It's my pleasure.

194
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,541
If I had a coffee right now, I'd go <i>loco.</i>

195
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,750
[Sierra] Okay. All set for your statement.

196
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,250
Go ahead.

197
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,125
I do have a question
before we get started.

198
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,458
I don’t know if it’s relevant, but...

199
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:57,166
I’ve been thinking about it a lot
and wanted to ask you, Alicia.

200
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,041
Ask away.

201
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,000
What's it like when you go home?

202
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,375
I mean,

203
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,583
you get home from work

204
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,125
after...

205
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,583
torturing a kid like Rio

206
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,416
who you’ve made stand for days

207
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,125
in a cell that's smaller than a closet,

208
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,083
shitting and pissing himself.

209
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,333
Then you go home... to Germán.

210
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,416
That’s what I wanted to ask.

211
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,958
You don’t mind they call you
a torturer in the press.

212
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,375
But Germán...

213
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,375
Because Germán is a really good person,

214
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,250
what does he say when you come home?

215
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,250
Does he ask you,
"How was your day, honey?"

216
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,250
Do you kiss him and...

217
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,166
you hug him?

218
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:48,833
What then?

219
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,291
Does he hug you? Kiss you?

220
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:51,708
Do you fuck?

221
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,500
Because I think you make him sick.

222
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,250
[beeps]

223
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:11,458
See, the truth... Well, It's been about
two months since Germán hugged me.

224
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,458
Since he hugged me, since he kissed me,
or made love to me.

225
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,750
To be precise, not since I cremated him.

226
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,875
They pulled a white sheet over his face,

227
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,000
they rolled him down to the morgue
in the hospital,

228
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,916
and that’s where the hugging stopped.

229
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,416
[Tamayo] Alicia, what are you doing?

230
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,375
He's dead.

231
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,166
Cancer...

232
00:13:58,708 --> 00:13:59,750
of the pancreas.

233
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,208
The kind where they tell you
you have two months,

234
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,416
and it's two months.

235
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:11,958
I was getting fat.

236
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,166
He was thin.

237
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:16,708
I was pink,

238
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,250
and he was yellow.

239
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It consumed him.

240
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,500
Life grew inside me,

241
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,125
and death grew in him.

242
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,208
But I guess that's cancer.

243
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,000
Do you know the last thing he said to me?

244
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,375
Can you believe his last words were...

245
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,958
"Turn on the news."

246
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,250
I thought he was gonna give me
one of those speeches of his

247
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:01,458
because you know he was really eloquent,
and he was really creative too.

248
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:04,000
And he said, "Turn on the news."
Turn on the news!

249
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,333
I mean, he was full of morphine,
of course,

250
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,125
so I guess that was affecting him.

251
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,041
That was it.

anyone about this before?

What would that get me?

260
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:18,708
A little bit of pity?

Oh, Alicia...

I feel for you, but I don't think you have
the capacity to lead this case right now.

00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,375
According to the colonel,
this concerns you all.

330
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,000
Well, he died.

331
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,375
[soft murmuring]

332
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,250
Tamayo...

333
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:12,458
thinks I'm in no condition
to lead this operation.

334
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,500
But the truth is,
there's no one better for the job than me.

335
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,000
No one.

336
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,083
No one.

337
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,458
Because I don't wanna go back
to my house...

338
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,208
and open my fridge...

339
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,291
or the mailbox...

340
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,833
because I'll see his name written down

341
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,666
and all our photos.

342
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,291
That's why I'm such a fucking robot

343
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,666
calculating 200 million plays per minute
against the Professor.

344
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,958
And that's what this heist needs
right now.

345
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,000
And that's what I need right now too.

346
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,458
Anyone care to say something to me?

347
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,250
No?

348
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:03,083
So let's have a little fun.
Let's get to work!

349
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,125
[Denver] Rio.

350
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,958
Tell me why you couldn’t shoot him.

351
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,333
I don't know.

352
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,250
I just froze.

353
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:35,416
- [Tokyo] <i>Why did you freeze, Rio?
- Because I'm not a fucking killer.</i>

354
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,208
You don’t have to be a killer.

355
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:46,208
I can’t look a guy in the face,
shoot him in the chest

356
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,351
- and pretend nothing happened.
- Shoot him in the leg!

357
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,500
- I can’t!
- Then knock him to the ground,

358
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:53,625
or throw him against a wall,
or whatever you need to do...

359
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:56,208
Listen to me.
I couldn't do it. I couldn't move!

360
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:01,250
<i>He told me he had a family.</i>

361
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:05,166
And he didn't have a gun.
I couldn’t do it!

362
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,416
Why couldn't you do it?

363
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:12,625
Tell everyone why.

364
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,333
You couldn’t do it
because you’re fucking traumatized!

365
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:20,666
And I told you,
but you didn’t fucking listen.

366
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:24,708
It's because of you. Yeah, you.
You almost killed Helsinki and Nairobi.

367
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,416
Denver, stop!

368
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,041
Rio warned us,
and Helsinki and Nairobi are alive.

369
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:31,333
That’s what's important.

370
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:33,336
[Helsinki] <i>There's something else
more important.</i>

371
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,416
<i>How did he get free?</i>

372
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,125
- You took Gandía to the bathroom.
- Yes.

373
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,416
- And you put the cuffs on good?
- Of course.

374
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,541
Of course, he did.

375
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,000
Of course, he did!

376
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:47,666
<i>The only thing that's clear here is that
something isn't adding up in your story.</i>

377
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,541
Tokyo, how does a handcuffed guy get out?

378
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:53,541
Nairobi, do you have any ideas?

379
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,041
Have any ideas? What?

380
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:59,208
Nothing, right?
Then I think there’s something here

381
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:00,750
that smells like bullshit.

382
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,583
Are you saying I’m a traitor?

383
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:07,416
- I don't know. Tell me.
- No!

384
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,500
Just say it.

385
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,041
[Bogotá] It's our fault.

386
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:15,633
Maybe we shouldn’t have left
the kid on guard,

387
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:18,125
<i>since he's dealing with PTSD.</i>

388
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,291
Rio isn’t the traitor.

389
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:23,958
[Professor] <i>And we have
a more urgent problem.</i>

390
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:25,041
Listen carefully.

391
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:28,125
The biggest threat is Gandía
communicating with the outside.

392
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:32,041
<i>They could coordinate an attack
from inside and outside simultaneously.</i>

393
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:33,916
What's the plan, Professor?

394
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:37,458
He needs to be killed.

395
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:41,583
Who?

396
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:43,708
Him.

397
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:47,416
[Professor] We are not killers.

398
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,750
Then we're gonna be corpses.

399
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:52,458
We’ll get rid of the governor’s personal
guards during the first hour of the heist.

400
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:56,541
They'll be the ones who leave the bank
with the State's secrets.

401
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:58,943
And that's the end of the problem.

402
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,041
[Denver] I said get the fuck out there!

403
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,250
That bastard isn't gonna leave
with the secrets.

404
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:04,666
No one move.

405
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,291
He won’t listen to our orders.

406
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:14,541
And Santiago?

407
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:18,726
Did he have time to leave the bank
after setting up that fun mess?

408
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,750
Yes.

409
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:23,416
- It looked like an accident.
- That explosion was magnificent!

410
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:30,916
I’ve brought the latest country
credit risk reports from my agency.

411
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,291
But... they're not published
until next month, no?

412
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:40,250
Yes, we’re still working on them,
but these are close to the final versions.

413
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:42,291
They're not very encouraging.

414
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:45,000
They’re going to affect
the rate of your public debt.

415
00:25:45,416 --> 00:25:48,791
- Any recommendations?
- Officially, liquid assets in the bank,

416
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:52,333
anti-inflationist measures.
You know, standard procedures.

417
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,625
If you'll allow my personal opinion

418
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:56,791
that will never appear in this report...

419
00:25:58,041 --> 00:25:59,041
gold.

420
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:03,583
Excuse me?

421
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:05,750
Increase your reserve of gold.

422
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:08,713
It’s the only safe currency that's still
on the rise, so bring it here...

423
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:10,958
to the vault in the Bank of Spain.

424
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:13,681
It’s the only choice that will give you
a guarantee in this market.

425
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:16,125
Look...

426
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:18,375
2008 was nothing.

427
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:22,041
Now the debt crisis is on its way.

428
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:26,916
Are you suggesting I...

429
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:30,000
gamble the entire national reserve...

430
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:31,833
on one single color?

431
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:34,958
No. I'm telling you
to bet everything on the winning team:

432
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:37,166
the gold.

433
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:40,708
[explosion]

434
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:43,578
[Governor] What’s happening?

435
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:45,916
[Gandía] Stay calm. Everything's okay.

436
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,125
Was that an explosion?

437
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:48,958
Guards to the governor’s office. Everyone.

438
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:51,375
Exterior security, this is Gandía.

439
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:54,208
Activate red alert.
I repeat, activate red alert.

440
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:55,583
Seal the bank doors.

441
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:57,976
- [man] <i>Anything outside?</i>
- No, I don't see anything outside.

442
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,101
- Where was the explosion?
- [man] <i>In the basement, sir.</i>

443
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:02,166
<i>Judging by the smell,
it could have been a gas leak.</i>

444
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:05,208
Copy that. Don't seal the doors.
I repeat, don't seal the doors.

445
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,666
We still might need to evacuate.

446
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,125
Maximum security alert!
Everyone put your vests on. Do it now!

447
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:15,875
[rock music]

448
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:26,750
They have military weapons in there.

449
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:28,393
I think he caresses them all afternoon,

450
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:30,625
longing for the moment
he can pull the trigger.

451
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:33,041
[Palermo] The guy was a green beret, eh?

452
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:35,083
Three years in the military,
but before that,

453
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:38,291
he was the personal bodyguard
of the Minister of the Interior.

454
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:41,750
He was deployed for operations
in Iraq and Lebanon,

455
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,708
and those are just the official ones.

456
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:48,000
Because in the six years that he was
a member of the special ops corps,

457
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:51,791
there isn't a single record
of his movements, and that means...

458
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:54,875
black ops, secret missions.

459
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,791
The guy’s an assassin, Sergio.

460
00:27:58,916 --> 00:27:59,916
He’s an assassin.

461
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:07,166
Have you found the weapon supply?

462
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,666
[Tokyo] <i>No, not yet.
We’ve searched everywhere,</i>

463
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,125
and no sign of any weapons.

464
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:15,041
I don’t know about the guns,
but the handcuffs were in the library.

465
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:19,500
[Bogotá] <i>That bastard took them off
on his own.</i>

466
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:21,223
[Berlin]
He'd be like a kid at Disneyland.

467
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:23,666
We kill him, or he kills us.

468
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:26,916
I saw him too.

469
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,291
And I think it's pretty clear...

470
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:35,333
If he gets the chance,
he'll kill us all like space invaders.

471
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:50,875
When you face him, act decisively...

472
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:52,708
in self-defense...

473
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:55,458
but without hesitation...

474
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:58,666
because he won't hesitate.

475
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:02,916
<i>He's a ruthless ex-mercenary.</i>

476
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:05,708
<i>Relentless.</i>

477
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:08,208
<i>And he’s going to try and kill you.</i>

478
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:10,916
What are you gonna be doing over there?

479
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,500
I’m going to tie everyones hands outside
so they don't break the truce.

480
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,250
That...

481
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,500
and I'll make them think
we’re stronger than ever.

482
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:31,166
Okay.

483
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,958
The most important thing you've gotta do
is take a long, deep breath.

484
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:40,125
That's real good.

485
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:43,041
- Tell me something you really enjoy.
- The sea.

486
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,700
The sea's perfect,

and hot day in the summer.

490
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,750
You're down at the beach

Yes, I feel it.

Now we’re on an air mattress,
floating in the water.

00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:15,375

and it smells like summer.

[Amanda] I feel so sleepy.

Let the sounds of the sea drift you away.

501
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:22,208

I'm about to share with you.

<i>To be honest, I’ve already shared this
with the national press.</i>

516

I imagine they’ll call you soon to check
the verity of the truce,

517
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:48,708
and I was hoping you’d confirm it.

And why would I do that?

519

Because if you don’t do that,

520
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:56,458
I’ll let them know
you faked Lisbon’s execution,

<i>and that she’s being held illegally,</i>

523
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:02,291
I don't think a judge will mind.

524
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:07,166
I also have recordings
of the supposed execution.

<i>or not arrest her daughter and mother
in Southeast Asia.</i>

528
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,583

Why would anyone else
start a mutiny now, baby? How marvelous!
