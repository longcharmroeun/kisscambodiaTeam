00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,500
You know what’s happening?

159
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,166
Your pregnancy has you so high on estrogen

160
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,416
that you've become the most
optimistic woman in Spain.

161
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:40,041
Try not to waste all those hormones.
You'll need them for delivery

162
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,791
'cause it fuckin' hurts.

163
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,666
What are you gonna do when it comes out?

164
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:50,750
Is it a boy or girl?

165
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,375
You don't know?

166
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
[scoffs]

167
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,333
Poor little child.

168
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,083
What the fuck happened?

169
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,541
They were barefoot, man.

170
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,166
Barefoot? Who was?

171
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,541
Rio and Stockholm.

172
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,958
- And?
- What do you mean, "And"?

173
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,541
Who goes barefoot
in the middle of a heist?

174
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,625
There’s something fucked up

175
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,250
about taking your shoes off on a couch
in the middle of a heist.

176
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,458
What? Are you stupid?

177
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,341
If they were thinking of fucking,
they'd fuck.

178
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:41,833
They'd keep their shoes on.

179
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,375
Well...

180
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,333
What were you making here last night?

181
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:52,875
This thing.

182
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,541
- You were making this?
- Yep.

183
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
[sighs]

184
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,708
You beat the shit out of a guy,

185
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,500
completely shattering her image of you,

186
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:14,625
and you try to fix it
by giving her a little golden heart?

187
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,333
What should I have done?

188
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:19,916
Change.

189
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,791
[blows smoke] In her eyes,

190
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,125
you're the bad guy now.

191
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:27,791
A violent guy.

192
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,958
Tell me how you fell in love.

193
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:32,833
I shot her in the leg.

194
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:35,083
- [coughing]
- No, I shot her in the leg

195
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,833
so I could save her life.
To save her life.

196
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,208
[Bogotácoughing]

197
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,291
I don't know.

198
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,708
[laughs softly]

199
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,416
I showed her some dance moves.

200
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,916
- You danced for her?
- Yeah.

201
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,708
I danced for her.

202
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,958
- [laughs]
- I don’t know. I told her stories.

203
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,875
We laughed a lot.

204
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,541
And...

205
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,333
when was the last time
you told her stories?

206
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,833
When was the last time you made her laugh?

207
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,625
When was the last time you danced for her?

208
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,250
Hey, Rio. Could you bring me
a little coffee, please?

209
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:29,708
I came up with this plan. If you're safe
here today, it’s because of me.

210
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,041
Have some gratitude.

211
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,291
You're stuck there,
so why don't you get some rest?

212
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,875
At least a little water.
That's all I want, please.

213
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,666
Just a little water?

214
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:48,708
[sighs]

215
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,041
I'm sorry, friend, but...

216
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,083
Thank you.

217
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,708
You look tired.

218
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,083
Can't you sleep?

219
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,250
You're waking up three, four times
a night at least, huh?

220
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,416
Hey, Rio...

221
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:17,041
if you need anything... to talk
or anything, I'm here. Okay?

222
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,375
Thank you.

223
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,583
That's the weakest link.

224
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,875
Palpitations,
excessive sweating, insomnia.

225
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,250
You have to break free during his watch.

226
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,541
He won't be able to pull the trigger.

227
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:47,083
What makes you think I won't kill you
as soon as I'm free?

228
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,166
Well...

229
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,500
I bashed your head in.

230
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,250
You fucked up my eyes.

231
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,750
Even.

232
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,666
A pact between gentlemen.

233
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,625
Are you asking me to trust you,
you piece of shit?

234
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,958
I'm telling you
they've declared a truce out there.

235
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,375
Armored vans aren't breaking in.

236
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:09,583
We're in a fucking Cold War,
and you and I are all alone.

237
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:10,666
And?

238
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:15,166
And I'm gonna turn you into the chaos
that this heist needs.

239
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,166
Into <i>Alien: The Eighth Passenger.</i>

240
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,500
Into John McClane... from <i>Die Hard.</i>

241
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,166
[dramatic music playing]

242
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,708
STORM RESERVOIR
KEEP OUT

243
00:15:58,875 --> 00:15:59,958
[Professor] <i>Let's go.</i>

244
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,708
[dramatic music continues]

245
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,541
[Tokyo] <i>The Professor arrived
at the storm reservoir</i>

246
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,833
<i>thinking about Raquel.</i>

247
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:39,166
<i>Just like Alberto did
when he stepped into the ambulance.</i>

248
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,333
<i>It's fascinating how two people
can think about someone...</i>

249
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:47,958
<i>at the same time...</i>

250
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,541
<i>in very different ways.</i>

251
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,166
<i>They say that love can move worlds...</i>

252
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,333
<i>but the truth is,
hate can be just as strong.</i>

253
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,250
- [Professor] <i>You were right.</i>
- [sighs]

254
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,333
<i>Lisbon's alive.</i>

255
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:07,958
Where is she?

256
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,841
For the moment, she's in the tent.
I imagine they're interrogating her.

257
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,333
<i>How long can they keep her there?</i>

258
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,750
[Professor]<i> I don't know, but I bet
they'll overlook the 72-hour custody rule.</i>

259
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,875
[Tokyo] <i>They'll transfer her
at some point.</i>

260
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,666
- Can you rescue her?
- <i>We can't do it during a transfer.</i>

261
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,666
It wouldn't be smart.

262
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,476
We did it with you. They would see
it coming, and it would be suicide.

263
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,666
<i>So what are you going to do?</i>

264
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,548
They have Lisbon with them, and she has
the entire plan inside her head,

265
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,708
<i>including the place
you're calling me from, Professor.</i>

266
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,500
Professor?

267
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:46,875
I don't know.

268
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,708
<i>I'm so tired. I can't...</i>

269
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,541
I can't even think.

270
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,583
<i>But I'll find a solution.
Don't worry about it.</i>

271
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,500
[metal clattering]

272
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,666
[Marseille] I'm making ravioli.
You need all the energy.

273
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:08,958
Is Palermo still tied up?

274
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,750
- Yes.
<i>- I want you to go to him</i>

275
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,083
and tell him this...

276
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,250
No, no, no. I'm not telling him anything.

277
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,583
<i>He'll bite my face like a rabid dog.</i>

278
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,875
<i>Well you’ll have to. I want you
to say it to him exactly like this...</i>

00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,250
She's being held in the tent,

282
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:30,000
and I need you
to think of a way to rescue her."

[scoffs]

284
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,583
- He won't do it.
- <i>Listen to me, Tokyo.</i>

285
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,875
The only thing I'm trying to do
is to get Palermo

286
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:40,375
<i>to fall back in love with this plan.
I need him to be on our side.</i>

287
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,916
Go and tell him,
while I think of something else.

288
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,250
Understood?

289
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,375
Understood.

290
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,000
[Palermo] I'm gonna head to the bathroom.
Would you like to accompany me, Sergio?

291
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,333
Have you ever had the privilege
of experiencing

292
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,958
masterful fellatio
from a man with great skill?

293
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,500
- [Berlin laughs]
- Hmm?

294
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,166
He's completely unpredictable.

295
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,500
Sergio, he was simply proposing
some fellatio quite gallantly.

296
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,642
- He doesn't know...
- You know what I’m talking about.

297
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,041
He's uncontrollable
because he's abnormally egocentric.

298
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,245
He'll respect the hierarchy.

299
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:46,791
He would respect it if the heist
was two hours, or three, or one night.

300
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,916
We're talking about multiple days,

301
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,750
and he'll be under
higher pressure than usual.

302
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,375
- I can keep Martín under control...
- You can't!

303
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:58,416
- Because I've been doing it for years.
- You can't control him. He's an egomaniac.

304
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,333
He's obsessed with being in charge.

305
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,833
And that can only mean one thing.

306
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,916
If it's not him in charge, he'll do
anything he has to do to take control.

307
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,750
And he won't care if he has to execute,
betray or create chaos.

308
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:17,791
He's obsessive, egocentric,
trusts his instincts and is a true genius.

309
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:18,750
Like you.

310
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,375
If you prefer mediocre people,

311
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,791
you'll find plenty here.
They'll follow you like sheep.

312
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,715
[Professor] Don't you understand
that being a genius complicates things?

313
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,958
He's dangerous
because we won't know what he'll do.

314
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,500
Listen to me. You're my brother.

315
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:33,500
I would put you in charge of any heist
without a shadow of a doubt.

316
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,291
But him...

317
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,500
You're wrong about trusting me
and not him. I'm much less reliable.

318
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,416
[man] Two beers.

319
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,833
Don't order any more peanuts.

320
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,875
You're already fatter than an elephant.

321
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,541
If you laugh at my bow tie,

322
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,583
you're laughing at me.

323
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,791
And if you laugh at me, I assure you,

324
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,625
for the rest of your life,
you'll remember March 17th,

325
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,625
but you don't know why that is yet.

326
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,708
Isn't the anticipation just thrilling?

327
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,916
[chuckles softly]

328
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:25,958
Is there a problem?

329
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:27,958
[Berlin] Not at all.

330
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,000
[Alberto] There's fingerprints
all over this place.

331
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The walls are covered with plans,

332
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,375
maps, diagrams.

333
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:44,625
They have an oven.

334
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,791
They likely used it
to get rid of evidence.

335
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,750
I'll take it for analysis.

336
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,666
[Alberto] I see traces of plastic,

337
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,791
possibly from an electronic device.

338
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,166
I'm gonna separate the melted parts.

339
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,750
I think I found something.

340
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:18,625
What's wrong?

341
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:19,916
Nothing.

342
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,041
So a Maserati, huh?

343
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:31,458
You've gotta be fucking kidding.
Is it out in the newspaper already?

344
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:32,666
It's totally fine.

345
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:39,309
- I can give you a ride, if you want.
- What the fuck are you saying, Tokyo?

346
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,166
No big deal.
Just a little ride. That's all.

347
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,250
That's all?

348
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:45,791
Then we push a button, erase the tape,

349
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:49,958
destroy the evidence,
and there's no record of anything.

350
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,291
Mónica dumped me.

351
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,083
I'm a free man.

352
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,166
So I don't need to erase
any fucking black box.

353
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,666
I'll take the Maserati,
stick my foot on the pedal,

354
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:14,458
and I'll start doing 360s
till the tires burn off...

355
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:16,101
without a care in the world, beautiful.

356
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:17,041
Oh...

357
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:18,875
- a reckless driver?
- So reckless.

358
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,458
So reckless you better be careful,

359
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:23,916
or you'll have to take the car to the
mechanics and change the suspension.

360
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,708
And wait until you see what I do
to the chassis.

361
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:29,541
So scary.

362
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:48,458
[Tamayo] This bastard
even leaves false clues in his shitter.

363
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,916
I bet it was put there on purpose.

364
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,351
By the way it was hidden
and melted at the back of the oven,

365
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,208
it's impossible
it was put there on purpose.

366
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:57,291
So then?

367
00:23:57,333 --> 00:24:00,708
The plastic from the chip
has a recorded number of up to 19 digits,

368
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,125
unique to each SIM card.

369
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,500
- Hm-mmm.
- This disappeared during the combustion,

370
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:08,416
but it seems that during the process,
it bent and touched the metallic chip,

371
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,583
and it imprinted seven numbers on it.

372
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:13,041
We crosschecked it
with data from several phone carriers,

373
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:17,666
and we came up with 354 cards
matching those end numbers.

374
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:22,583
One of them was bought three months ago
and has only made one call,

375
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:24,458
and it was made during the heist.

376
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:25,416
Bingo!

377
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
- Where was the call made?
- Wait, wait!

378
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,083
A little bit of suspense.

379
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:32,666
[imitates drum roll]

380
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:34,791
[sighs]

381
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,750
Mindanao, the Philippines.

382
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,083
Oh, fuck! I knew it!

383
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,291
We'll talk with Interpol.

384
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
[high energy music]

385
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:50,750
[phone rings]

386
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:55,726
- Yes?
- [Antoñanzas] <i>Mindanao, the Philippines.</i>

387
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,750
<i>They know.</i>

388
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,833
- [Professor] How?
- A half-burnt SIM card in the ambulance.

389
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:14,666
This doesn't change anything for you.

390
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,666
I need you to get to that office now.

391
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:20,083
Show her the watch,
and tell her. "I'm with you."

392
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:22,541
That <i>I</i> am?
Should I say it like that?

393
00:25:22,958 --> 00:25:23,833
Pardon?

394
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:25,916
<i>Like that: "I'm with you."
It might be confusing.</i>

395
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,458
She could think I'm just some weirdo,
or that I'm a communist.

396
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:30,583
<i>If I say, "The Professor is with you,"
it's clearer.</i>

397
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:32,458
"Is". In third person.

398
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:34,666
Benito, just show her the watch
and nothing more.

399
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,750
Understood.

400
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,458
Hostages out.

401
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,958
[Matías]
Everybody up and to the stairs!

402
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:49,541
How's being in charge, darling?
How are we feeling?

403
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:50,833
Magnificent.

404
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,833
Well, I'm all ears. Go ahead.

405
00:25:56,958 --> 00:25:59,166
You have the following message
from the Professor:

406
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,375
"Lisbon is alive.

407
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:03,541
She's being held in the tent, and I need
you to think of a way to rescue her."

408
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:05,166
It's an order.

409
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:08,791
First, you stage a <i>coup d'état.</i>
Now you give me an order.

410
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:10,541
That's curious. I'd say that's...

411
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:15,708
very dangerous, but then again,
it's understandable, of course.

412
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:18,958
Look at them all.
The women are empowered.

413
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:22,541
That shit floats to the top

414
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:24,583
- then back down the drain.
- All done?

415
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,500
What happened?

416
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:29,583
To me?

417
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:33,041
Are you angry with your mama?

418
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:37,000
She didn't breastfeed you enough? Hmm?

419
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:41,833
So you hate women
because... you need milk desperately?

420
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,750
Well...

421
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,500
this order came from the Professor.

422
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:52,875
And he has a dick, just like you.

423
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:56,500
[tense music playing]

424
00:27:08,916 --> 00:27:10,375
[Sierra] They're in Mindanao.

425
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:14,208
In 24 hours, we'll have them.

426
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,416
You know how this goes.

427
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,750
Paula comes here,

428
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:21,000
you're declared guilty
of abducting your own child,

429
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:22,416
you lose your custody,

430
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,083
and she goes to live with her father.

431
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,666
So you're here to tell me I'm fucked?
[sniffs]

432
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,958
I already know that.

433
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,416
It depends.

434
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:44,458
I'll let you call them.
Right here. Right now.

435
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,791
And you can lead them to safety.

436
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:49,708
When we get to your hideout in Mindanao,
they'll be gone.

437
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:51,083
We fucked up.

438
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:54,166
The thought of Paula
being with that bastard Alberto

439
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,375
doesn't thrill me either.

440
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:02,625
What's Paula doing right now?

441
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,375
Go on. Close your eyes. Picture her.

442
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:10,583
Tucked in bed.

443
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:13,750
Her hair across the blanket.
You can almost smell her.

444
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,625
Close your eyes.

445
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:18,375
Picture her.

446
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,500
Go on.

447
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,500
What are you doing, Alicia?

448
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:29,625
It's only a five-year wait,
and then you'll be reunited again.

449
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,750
She comes running to you. "Mommy!"

450
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:34,666
She hugs you like this,
curled up around you,

451
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:37,041
with her arms and legs
like a little monkey.

452
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,458
And you press her against your chest...

453
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:43,583
and grab her little face...

454
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,416
to look at her.

455
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,875
But she won't let you go.

456

She repeats over and over,

457
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:55,125
like a prayer
that will save her from evil,

what do you think he would tell you to do?

467

five years in prison?

I’ll trade it for five minutes.

I'm offering you freedom.

Sergio goes to jail, but you go free.

472

Your arrest was never official. [chuckles]

You call them, get them to safety.

00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:43,333
In 24 hours, you'll all be together.

475
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:46,208
We'll never come after you.

476
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,000
Everything will be over.

477
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:58,541
[sniffles]

478
00:30:04,666 --> 00:30:06,458
[tense music continues]

479
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:40,125
Better?

480
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:41,708
Hm-mmm.

481
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,083
[Stockholm] So?

482
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:55,333
Were you able to get any sleep?

483
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:58,916
I tried to, but I just can't do it.

484
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:02,916
Are you having nightmares?

485
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,208
Every time I close my eyes,
I relive it all again.

486
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:22,458
So, what happened to the alpha male?

487
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:25,416
I thought you were a free man.

488
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:29,666
- [Denver] What are they talking about?
- [Tokyo] Oh!

489
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:32,083
[as Rio] Hello, beautiful.

490
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:34,583
I'd like to bring you to my island.

491
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,416
But only if you don't party all the time.

492
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:40,333
I'm not really into chunda-chunda
or dancing, you know?

493
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:46,875
If you invite me over,
I'll show you my tiny bikini.

494
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:49,750
[both laugh]

495
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,916
Why didn't you tell us?

496
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,750
I couldn't.

497
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:59,500
You need to talk about it, Rio.
It’s important.

498
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:04,000
They took me out of my cell at night,

499
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:07,875
and forced me
to dig my own grave out in the desert.

500
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:14,166
[Tokyo] I'm really really sweet, and...

501
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:17,083
that's why I'm smiling
the whole fucking day.

502
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:18,208
[Denver laughs]

503
00:32:18,666 --> 00:32:21,125
Then they made me drag a coffin
in the hole I dug.

504
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,791
Then they forced me to get inside.

505
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:31,541
Then they threw sand into the hole.

506
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:34,333
[panting]

507
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:35,416
Until I was buried.

508
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:40,125
And then they left me there.

509
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,916
[breathing heavily]

510
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,041
In the darkness.

511
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:47,208
In the silence.

512
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:50,416
- I could barely breathe.
- Ssh.

513
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,416
- [panting]
- Ssh.

514
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,541
Calm down.

515
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:55,958
Breathe.

516
00:32:58,541 --> 00:32:59,791
I'm here with you.

517
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,166
Do you know what I just kept thinking?

518
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,416
What?

519
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:08,500
That the Professor...

520
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:11,916
should be the one inside that coffin,
not me.

521
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,541
I'm sorry.

522
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:19,458
[Tokyo, mocking] Look. Oh!

523
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:29,291
[Tokyo scoffs]

524
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:35,750
Okay, let's go.

525
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:56,291
Pardon me for a moment.
I'm going to the restroom.

526
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,750
You don't trust me.

527
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:14,333
I'm an egomaniac.

528
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:19,125
I'm only willing to follow my plan.

529
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:22,708
I'm so obsessed with being in charge

530
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:25,333
if something doesn’t go
according to my plan...

531
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:28,916
I could become dangerous, no?

532
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:35,833
That's right.

533
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:37,958
That's what I believe.

534
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:40,833
I'd agree.

535
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,833
But there's one thing
you're not considering.

536
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,333
Not only do I love your brother,

537
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:50,291
but I also love the plan,

538
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:52,166
and that love is equal.

539
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:54,791
I would betray you.
That's perfectly clear.

540
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,083
And the rest of the gang, too.

541
00:34:57,166 --> 00:34:59,166
But the plan? Never.

542
00:35:00,416 --> 00:35:02,125
And that's where my loyalty lies.

543
00:35:04,791 --> 00:35:07,291
This is so much more than a heist,
and you know it.

544
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:11,166
Right now, the plan isn't perfect.
I can recognize that.

545
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,958
It's an unfinished poem.

546
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:16,333
We need you, brother.

547
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:19,750
[inhales and exhales deeply]

548
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:22,833
[dramatic music playing]

549
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:29,458
Please.

550
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:43,666
[door closes]

551
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,416
[light jazz music playing]

552
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,750
You were very brave out there.

553
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:52,250
And that's admirable.

554
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:56,791
Very commendable.

555
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,833
Just let me leave, please.

556
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:15,500
[laughs softly]

557
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:17,375
You seemed brave earlier,

558
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:19,750
but now you have to demonstrate
that bravery.

559
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:24,666
[groans]

560
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:30,041
Let's have a look at those balls.

[groans]

562
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:33,208
Ssh!

563
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:34,291
Hang in there.

564
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:39,750
Hang in there.
And tell me, what do you prefer?

565
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:41,208
[groans]

566
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:42,291
[Berlin] Death?

567
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:44,875
Look at me. Or impotence?

568
00:36:45,416 --> 00:36:47,517
Sometimes your forced
to make tough decisions in life.

569

Mine: what do I do with the asshole
who's making fun of my bow tie?

570
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,000
Yours:

571
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:54,291
is it even worth living without a penis?

572
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:55,416

He's taking a long time.

576
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:06,208
He’s beating the shit out of the fat guy
in the bathroom.

577
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:09,083
I haven't heard any punches
or any other noise.

578
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:13,083
Real chaos, my dear Sergio,

579
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:15,791
makes no noise.

580
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:21,666
[Tokyo] <i>Palermo was loyal to the plan,</i>

581
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,125
<i>but in his mind,
that only meant one thing.</i>

582
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:27,000
<i>For the heist to continue,</i>

583
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:29,125
<i>he had to be back in charge,</i>

584
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:33,208
<i>and to do that, he would quietly
create chaos we never saw coming.</i>

585
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:36,208
[whispers] You know what you have to do.
Don't be a coward.

586
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:39,250
You have to dislocate the joint

between the trapezium
and the thumb's first metacarpal

with strength and determination

Grab your thumb and twist it.

590
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,208
- No handcuff can stop that.
- [Rio] Ssh.

591
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:53,041
Do I have to sit you kids apart,
like in school?

592
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:02,125
[Palermo] It'll hurt a tiny bit,

593
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:04,708
but your freedom will be worth it.
Don't you think?

594
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:09,416
Now do it.

What are you going to do?
Are you going to shoot an unarmed man?

I swear to God,
if I have to, I will shoot you.

605

You're gonna kill an unarmed father
