00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,286
for the rest of their lives.

165
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,041
They fired two rockets at us,
and all of Spain saw it.

166
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,541
I am not starting a war
in the center of Madrid.

167
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,833
The war has started!

168
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,208
Tamayo. Tamayo, don't fuck this up.
Don't make the worst mistake of your life.

169
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,250
The mistake was you torturing that kid.

170
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,791
If we'd just taken him to court,
we wouldn't be here.

171
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,795
We made them stronger and gave them
an argument. I'm not doing that again.

172
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,083
You're scared.

173
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:26,791
[scoffs]

174
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,250
[breathing heavily]

175
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,666
You’re just like Prieto...

176
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,458
a Viagra box on the bedside table
for your limp erection. Ugh!

177
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,625
And you think that the law will save you.
Hm!

178
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,750
The law can't help us now.

179
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,166
I am the law.

180
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,958
And limp erection, my ass!

181
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,875
We need to keep our composure.

182
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,916
I want to de-escalate the situation.
Everyone understand?

183
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,333
Dialogue and truce. Truce and dialogue.

184
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,458
Is that clear?

185
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,708
Crystal clear, boss.

186
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,500
Antoñanzas?

187
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,416
Antoñanzas!

188
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,625
Yes, Inspector?

189
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:14,750
You heard him, no?

190
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,500
That guy is the law. Like John Wayne.

191
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,958
I want a surgical ambulance and a surgeon.

192
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,291
Now!

193
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,666
Let's get out there and make them
hand over their wounded.

194
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,915
The Governor took three medical courses
in the army.

195
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,791
He's gonna help with the operation.

196
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:44,708
I didn't finish my studies,
and I didn't pursue it as a career,

197
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,458
but I remember some principles.

198
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,875
Great. Put your scrubs on.

199
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,291
I'll get 'em.

200
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:50,833
So where's the surgeon?

201
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,791
I'm trying to make contact,
but they have to allow access.

202
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:57,250
Bogotá, anesthetic.
Nairobi, we're putting you to sleep.

203
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,791
You're not putting me to sleep! Tokyo!

204
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:02,875
Tokyo...

205
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,583
Tell him it's my life,

206
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,541
and I decide.

207
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:08,416
Please!

208
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,583
It is your life. That's why we're doing
the surgery here, so relax.

209
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,083
Tokyo, please.

210
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:14,791
Please.

211
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,666
[Nairobi coughs]

212
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:20,541
She decides.

213
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,541
That's final.

214
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
[inhales deeply]

215
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:29,000
Helsinki, put her to sleep.
That’s a fucking order.

216
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,833
You don't give me orders.
You're not my boss.

217
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,583
You let her get the phone.

218
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,166
You're supposed to protect us.

219
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,916
She can make mistakes, but you can't!

220
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,666
Shut your mouth, fat ass,
or I'll kill you right now,

221
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,750
you son of a bitch!

222
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,333
You're my little whore, not my mama.

223
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:52,125
It's her fault she's like that
because she chose to be a fucking idiot.

224
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,541
If Nairobi says she's leaving,
I'm walking her to the door.

225
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,208
And you, you piece of shit,

226
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,208
you're gonna shut your mouth

227
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,166
because from now on,
you're no longer my boss.

228
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,916
- Tokyo, lower the fucking pistol.
- Denver...

229
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,625
If Nairobi talks, they'll kill us all.
We're doing the operation in here.

230
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,916
What do you know about operations,
you idiot?

231
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,166
Nairobi needs a surgeon.

232
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,166
Are you all fucking crazy or what?

233
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,208
I swear on my son...

234
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,583
I won't tell them anything.

235
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:27,083
That’s what you think, but when they
start torturing you, it changes.

236
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:28,916
Go fuck yourself.

237
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,250
Nairobi's leaving.

238
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,333
[cocks gun]

239
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:34,916
I don't think so.

240
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,083
[laughs]

241
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:42,333
Do you really think that now is a good
moment to play the rebel leader? Hmm?

242
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:45,375
One of us is dying,
so just stop fucking around!

243
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,208
Another one of us.

244
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,541
What do you mean, "another"?

245
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,708
They executed Lisbon half an hour ago.

246
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,416
[exhales]

247
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,166
If I could show you all
my magnificent democratic side,

248
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,083
we could vote and get her out,
but I'd be killing her.

249
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:11,041
Lisbon was executed on her knees, unarmed.

250
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:15,375
They brought Nairobi's son with his teddy
bear so they could shoot her in the head.

251
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,916
Do you think a couple of nuns
from the Red Cross are waiting outside?

252
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,291
Stop fucking around!

253
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,083
[sighs]

254
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,375
[Palermo sighs]

255
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,333
Palermo is right.

256
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,208
You're gonna have to cut me open...

257
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:34,916
and take the bullet out.

258
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,791
[sobs] Maybe...

259
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,541
cut out part of my lung.

260
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,833
And all that without me bleeding to death.

261
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,541
You're gonna kill me!

262
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,250
You're gonna kill me.

263
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,541

264
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,083
It's too complicated.

265
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,416
Helsinki, it's too complicated.

266
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,708
Take me to the door.

267
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,500
- Take me...
- [Helsinki] Stay calm.

268
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,750
- Take me to the door!
- Stay calm.

269
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,625
- Stay calm.
- Take me to the door!

270
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,958
- [Helsinki] It's gonna be okay.
- Thank you.

271
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,000
- It's gonna be okay.
- [Nairobi] No!

00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,375
No! I don't want to! No!

273
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,916
No, no, no, no!

274
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,333
- [Helsinki] Ssh.
- [Nairobi] No!

275
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,583
No!

No! No! No! [crying]

[dramatic music]

280
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:48,291
Forgive us, Professor,
uh, we just had an argument tonight.

281
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,458
I'm going to sleep with Tokyo.

[door slams]

283
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,208
Is this okay with you, Tokyo?
Do you mind that I'm sleeping here?

284
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,333
It's totally fine.

285
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,791
So you know, when someone in my bed,

286
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,041
I get really horny.
You don't care, do you?

287
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:23,541
- Uh, I don't care about what?
- You and I getting rid of our stress.

I knew that was a joke.

Can somebody please explain to me
why the fuck Palermo...

293
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,708
is leading this?

294
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,500
Because it was his idea?

295

- And he's the genius.
- <i>He's </i>the genius?

his balls in the hallway

in charge of this?

Yeah, you.

I think so too.
If there's anyone who cares

303

about this heist going well, it's you.

304

Don't put ideas in my head, huh.

305
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,125
Don't put ideas in my head.

[door opens]

00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,416
[Tokyo] Professor,

313
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,708
I wanna take charge...

314
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,458
of the heist. I'll be better than Palermo.

315
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,958
Tokyo, can we talk about it
in the morning?

316
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,416
The morning? No, now.

317
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:43,000
Why does he have to be in charge?
- Let's see, Tokyo. He...

318
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:48,125
is in charge because this heist has been
in development for a long time, and...

319
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,791
he's been on it since the beginning.
He has the plan in his head.

320
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:51,875
[Tokyo] So?

321
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,833
I can learn the plan.
I'm a quick learner.

"Platero is a small, soft, hairy donkey.

00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:56,291
O negative and A negative.
Draw blood for three operations,

486
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:58,291
and ask if anyone's a doctor.

487
00:28:58,375 --> 00:28:59,833
Bogotá, downstairs.

488
00:28:59,916 --> 00:29:02,583
It's our only way out of here.
Keep melting gold.

489
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Being in charge suits you.

490
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,625
Nobody trusts you anymore.

491
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:16,125
Do you know what your only way out
is gonna be when I'm not here?

492
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:21,291
To walk out with your hands
on the back of your head,

493
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:25,375
and pray they don't shoot you because
of all the cameras and people outside.

Go ahead, doctor.

<i>Make an incision 15 centimeters

[Tokyo] Scalpel.

500
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:47,833
Should anyone get injured,

501
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:50,083
we'll be more than ready
to save their life.

502
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:54,583
We'll learn the protocols for the most
common cases of gunshot wounds.

503
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:58,333
And in the military truck with all
the equipment we need for the heist,

504
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:03,625
we'll include medical equipment in case
any type of surgery is necessary.

505

<i>Dr. Ahmed will be the brains,

00:30:08,916 --> 00:30:10,166
<i>so you will be his hands.</i>

507
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:12,291
<i>It won't be easy.</i>

508
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:14,541
You can't hesitate.

509
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:17,458
You can't fail.

510
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:21,208
Because it's not gonna be
a dead pig on the table.

511
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,375
It'll be one of you.

512

<i>- Aspirator. I can't see well.</i>
- [Tokyo] Bring the camera closer.

513
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,916
[Dr. Ahmed]
Always keep the surgical area clear.

514
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,250
- Better.
- So what's next?

515
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:39,291
<i>We need to separate the ribs.</i>

516
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,916
<i>It's possible</i>

517
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,166
<i>you will have to remove part of the lung.</i>

518
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,250
[Río] Separate the ribs?
Are you kidding?

519
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:47,875
[Tokyo] Go get me the rib spreader.

520

[tense music]

521
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:56,333
- Is this it?
- Yes. Bring it here.

522
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:09,125
Those with blood type O negative
and A negative, put your hands up now.

523
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,208
Are you gonna make us
check your medical records, or what?

524
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:22,416
Paquita.

525

You were a nurse, weren't you?

526
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:26,625
Yes, sir, and a midwife.

527
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:28,166
Then follow me.

528
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,500
Everyone who raised their hands

[Professor] Marseille?

Yeah, it's me. Keep calm.

[Professor grunts]

535
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:12,833
- Come on. There's no police.
- And the bull?

536
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:16,000
- What bull?
- Help me get up. My body's numb.

537
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:27,583
[Marseille] That bull?

538
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:29,583
- [growls]
- That bull.

539

Oh!

540
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,500
[Professor] Step back

really slowly, Marseille.

542
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:36,208
Don’t stop staring him in the eye.

543
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,875
Backwards.

544
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:40,958
- Doesn't this remind you of something?

[Marseille] No.

Italy.

548
00:32:45,791 --> 00:32:47,833

This bouquet thing,
don't single women catch it?

551
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:56,041
Martín, do you see any single woman here?

552
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:58,916
- The closest thing we have is you.
- [both laugh]

[Tatiana] It's tradition!
The bride throws the bouquet,

554
00:33:01,291 --> 00:33:03,541
so just move a little further back.

The fun never stops. Gotta love Italians.
[laughs]

559
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:15,666
I'm not mute. I just keep quiet.

560
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,916
And I'm not... I am not a librarian.

561

Please limit yourself
to calling me Sergio.

Life.

You're sad, Professor?

you can talk to me about feelings.

610

Um, who's the blood for?

Why do you care who the blood's for?

619

I saw two people going upstairs
with the teddy bear,

Well, now you know who it's for.

so I could talk to you in person.

627
00:38:42,916 --> 00:38:45,708
I know we didn't exactly start off
on the right foot,

628
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:48,208
but at the end of the day,
the only thing that's important

629
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:49,875
is that you raise my son.

630
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:52,583
- Thank you.
- What are you doing, you moron?

631
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,208
It's fine, Paquita. That's enough.
That's enough. Thank you.

632
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,916
I know at your age

I’m pretty sure changing shitty diapers

That’s why you've got my respect.

636
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:16,083
Because you've gotta be a real man
to take care of a kid that was born

637
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:17,583
from the sperm of another guy.

Shut up, and don't fuck with me,

644
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,458
What have you done?
What if I didn't check these?

645
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:36,781
This could have killed Nairobi.

I’m sorry.

647

I’m sorry. I was wrong.
I swear I'd never do that on purpose.

648
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:46,625
I knew I was A something,
but I didn’t know what,

649
00:39:46,708 --> 00:39:48,468
positive or negative.
Who knows these things?

650

It's not something you use every day.

Oh, okay. So you're confused now.
Is that it?

[Arturo groans]

- What the fuck, Denver?
- What do you mean?

654
00:39:58,583 --> 00:40:01,541
What are you doing?
Maybe he was actually confused. Fuck.

Get up!

You can't go around
punching people like that. Jesus!

00:40:10,666 --> 00:40:12,586
It's enough
that they're already trapped in here.

660
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:15,166
Now it's over.
He's okay. It’s over. I'm sorry.

661
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:16,750
It's no problem.

662

I know why you're so pissed at me, buddy.

666
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,458
- Why? Why?
- It's okay. I get it.

667
00:40:28,875 --> 00:40:31,166
Monica told you
what happened in the bathroom, didn't she?

668
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,333
What bathroom?

669
00:40:33,541 --> 00:40:35,916
What bathroom? What is he talking about?

670
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,708
I really apologize.

671
00:40:37,791 --> 00:40:41,250
I'm sorry. God, I don't know
what was going through my head, really.

672
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:44,750
It was so long since I'd seen her.
She was so close.

673
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:46,875
I don't know.
I guess I didn't read the signs right.

674
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:52,500
She told me that we would meet somewhere
after this so I could see my son.

675
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:55,333
One thing led to another, and I jumped.

676
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:56,625
You jumped?

677
00:40:57,208 --> 00:40:58,291
He jumped for what?

678
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:00,041
Denver, nothing happened.

679
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,458
Just let it go. Let it go.

680
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:06,875
You were gonna meet this piece of shit
to show him our son?

681
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:10,166
He tricked me. He said he was his father.
He was emotional.

682
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,291
Yeah, but what did he jump for?
I don't understand this.

683
00:41:13,375 --> 00:41:15,750
[Arturo] She didn't do anything.
Leave Monica out of it.

684
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:17,333
The person at fault is me.

685
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:20,125
We hugged, I got aroused,

686
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:21,666
- things got heated.
- Shut up!

687
00:41:22,666 --> 00:41:23,666
Is this true?

688
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,291
This dumb motherfucker

689
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:30,333
rubbed himself against you with a hard-on?

690
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:33,625
I pushed him away
in a second with the gun, Denver.

691
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:35,541
Listen to me.

692
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:37,666
I defended myself, Denver.

693
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,416
So it is true.

What the fuck do you have inside of you?

704
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:23,291
So much rage.

705
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:27,583
So much violence.

706
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:29,625
You shot a hostage.

707
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:33,291
And now you beat him up.

708
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:36,000
Like a maniac.

[sobs] I can't do this.

I don't know what your trauma is.

711
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:44,500
I don't know what your trauma is
or where it comes from, but...

712
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:46,250
I can't, Denver.

713
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:51,083
I can't, and I don’t want to.

714
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:53,125
I don’t want to.

715
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,500
I don’t want my son...

716
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:59,750
to feel that irrational violence
you carry inside of you.

717
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:02,250
I don't want that.

720
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:33,916
- Is it him?
- The car rolled several times.

721
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,416
There's traces of blood, we can't find
the driver. It's gotta be him.

722
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,625
Or a drug dealer,
or a random criminal, no?

723
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:42,166
The car was stolen
two and a half hours ago in Salvatierra,

724
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:45,333
the closest village
to the place where we found Murillo.

725
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,041
And he climbs trees.

- <i>Was it him?</i>

I think so. He can't be far.
Looks like he lost a lot of blood.

732
00:44:04,416 --> 00:44:07,166
We'll leave it to Suarez.
I need you here with Murillo.

733
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:10,125
Bring her to Madrid.
That's what's most important. Got it?

- Yeah, copy that.
<i>- And make sure Suarez</i>

even the fucking monasteries.

738
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:23,250
The only way he's getting away from us
is if he's dead.

Pamuk.

00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:37,125
What?

741
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,125
My dog's name was Pamuk.

742
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:42,125
It was with me during the whole war.

743
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:43,875
I know what you feel.

744
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:46,666
Marseille, are you trying to create
a metaphor

745
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,208
or something between your dead dog
and my wife?

746
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:50,833
She was a female dog.

747
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:57,166
After the war,
all of my friends were dead.

748
00:44:58,208 --> 00:44:59,458
And I...

749
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,583
spent my nights in a bar.

750
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:05,125
One day, another day.

751
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,916
Pamuk was always outside waiting. Always.

752
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:14,458
So you two were also in love,
and was she executed in front of you?

753
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Yes.

754
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:25,208
What happened to Pamuk?

755
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:30,791
The boys from the village...

756
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,458
liked to play war.

757
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:36,458
So after a while,

758
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:41,833
without an enemy,
they got all bored of playing war.

759
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:43,375
One day,

760
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:45,625
they found some rocks.

761
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:49,291
They broke bottles...

762
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:53,375
and said my Pamuk

763
00:45:53,958 --> 00:45:55,166
was the enemy.

764
00:45:59,916 --> 00:46:00,916
I'm sorry.

765
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:06,958
She was a good dog.

00:49:37,916 --> 00:49:40,375
[Dr. Ahmed] <i>Let's do it.
There's no time to waste.</i>

803
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:43,166
<i>Listen and follow my instructions
very closely.</i>

804
00:49:44,083 --> 00:49:47,083
<i>- We're going to move slowly. Understood?</i>
- [Tokyo] Understood.

805
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:48,166
Colonel...

806
00:49:49,166 --> 00:49:51,267
If the satellite belonged
to a phone company in Spain,

807
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:53,934
- we'd have to request a temporary jam...
- I don't need you to tell me

808
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:55,083
what we can't do.

809
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:57,416
I told you to cut off
their little phone call.

810
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,750
[Dr. Ahmed]<i> If a vessel gets cut,
we remove the scalpel</i>

811
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:04,000
<i>- and close with Kocher forceps.</i>
- [Tokyo] Understood.

812
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:06,625
We'd have to jam every signal in the area,

813
00:50:06,708 --> 00:50:09,833
take down the Internet and anything
going through satellites.

814
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:12,291
Like in Egypt in 2011.

815
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:13,375
Do it.

816
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:16,583
[Dr. Ahmed] <i>Let's make the first incision.</i>

817
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:18,833
<i>- Can you see the lingula?</i>
- What's a lingula?

818
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:20,750
<i>It's the lower part of the lung...</i>

819
00:50:21,666 --> 00:50:23,416
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What happened?

820
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,750
[Río] You've gotta be kidding!

821
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:29,958
What happened?

822
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,750
- There's no return signal.
- What?

823
00:50:34,833 --> 00:50:35,916
[Río] Oh, fuck!

824
00:50:38,791 --> 00:50:42,000
- We can't reach the doctor! It's down!
- [speaking Serbian]

825
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:43,083
What do we do?

826
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:45,958
Her blood pressure's dropping.
We're about to lose her!

827
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:49,041
- [Tokyo] No, no, no, no. Fuck!
- [beeping]

828
00:50:54,208 --> 00:50:57,958
[closing theme music playing]
