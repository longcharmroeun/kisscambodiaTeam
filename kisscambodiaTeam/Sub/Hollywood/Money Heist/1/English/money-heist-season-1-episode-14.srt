1
00:00:16,341 --> 00:00:17,781
Tokyo is back!

2
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:22,341
Tokyo is back!
On the ground!

3
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:25,021
We have to open the door, damn it!

4
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:28,701
-Shoot the target, shoot the biker!

5
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:35,181
Let's go!

6
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,541
No! We have to cover her!

7
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,381
"Kidnapper in range, open fire."

8
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:51,261
Dad, look out!

9
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:56,341
"Unit 3. behind you, behind you!"

10
00:01:17,741 --> 00:01:18,661
Fuck!

11
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:28,161
This is fucking crazy.

12
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:29,921
What is?

13
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:31,641
All of this, Dad.

14
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:36,721
"It'll work out this time,
I'm telling you."

15
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:37,801
"This time?"

16
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:39,121
It has to work out.

17
00:02:39,921 --> 00:02:41,921
-We deserve it, right?
-Of course we do.

18
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:53,601
Help, help!

19
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:54,721
Please!

20
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:55,801
The first aid kit!

21
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:57,481
The fucking first aid kit!

22
00:02:57,561 --> 00:02:58,441
Cover the wound!

23
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:01,961
Look at me.

24
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:02,961
Easy.

25
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:06,201
It's just a scratch,
that's all.

26
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:08,121
On his side.

27
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:12,921
There's no exit hole.

28
00:03:13,321 --> 00:03:14,401
The bullet's inside.

29
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:15,561
Nairobi!

30
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:17,161
-I'm here!
-For fuck's sake.

31
00:03:17,361 --> 00:03:18,521
He's bleeding out.

32
00:03:18,801 --> 00:03:19,801
Don't worry, son.

33
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,081
I've got loads of blood.

34
00:03:22,521 --> 00:03:24,601
I've eaten lots of blood sausage.

35
00:03:24,681 --> 00:03:25,961
Okay, hold him in place.

36
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:27,361
Berlin,

37
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:28,641
-morphine.
-Relax.

38
00:03:29,521 --> 00:03:31,561
-Here we go. Okay.
-Ready!

39
00:03:31,641 --> 00:03:33,201
I'm starting a line for him.

40
00:03:33,721 --> 00:03:34,601
Okay,

41
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,081
-Here.
-Let me, let me.

42
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:37,161
Come on, come on.

43
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:42,681
Pull this, Denver.

44
00:03:43,281 --> 00:03:44,441
Wait, wait!

45
00:03:54,121 --> 00:03:55,481
I'm starting a line for him.

46
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:56,881
Breathe slowly.

47
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:04,761
Breathe slower.

48
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:08,281
-His pulse is shooting up.
-Gauze!

49
00:04:10,881 --> 00:04:11,721
That's it.

50
00:04:12,441 --> 00:04:13,401
Relax, Moscow.

51
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,521
Moscow, relax.

52
00:04:17,881 --> 00:04:19,521
Listen,
you're going to be okay.

53
00:04:20,121 --> 00:04:21,321
Right? You'll be okay.

54
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:22,481
-Yes.
-Right?

55
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:23,801
It's okay, Moscow.

56
00:04:29,881 --> 00:04:30,761
It's okay, Moscow.

57
00:04:32,121 --> 00:04:33,121
Relax.

58
00:04:33,961 --> 00:04:34,841
Relax.

59
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:56,161
They put three bullets in him, Rio.

60
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:57,921
Three bullets.

61
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:07,061
TUESDAY 7:35 PM

62
00:05:10,741 --> 00:05:13,501
105 HOURS INTO THE HEIST

63
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:25,481
-Son of a bitch.
-Raquel.

64
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:35,361
I broke free.

65
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,241
I could have escaped.

66
00:05:38,961 --> 00:05:40,801
I could have killed you, Raquel.

67
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:47,241
You didn't believe that polygraph either.

68
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:54,241
Look,
this proves that I'm telling the truth.

69
00:06:14,201 --> 00:06:16,401
You just fucked up
with this act of love,

70
00:06:16,481 --> 00:06:18,881
because
I'm putting you away for 80 years.

71
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:33,921
Get up.

72
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:35,561
Slowly.

73
00:07:42,641 --> 00:07:45,001
Hands on your head and turn around.

74
00:07:48,881 --> 00:07:50,841
Don't move...
what the hell are you doing?

75
00:07:52,001 --> 00:07:53,361
Don't move. Don't move!

76
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:54,641
I said don't move!

77
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,281
Hands on your head!

78
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,361
Not a single step further.

79
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:35,921
Raquel, I'm not stopping.

80
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:41,441
You're going to have to kill me.

81
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:16,801
Fuck!

82
00:09:18,681 --> 00:09:20,481
Son of a bitch, my phone!

83
00:10:09,481 --> 00:10:10,441
Three bullets!

84
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:13,121
They put three bullets in his
stomach!

85
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:17,241
We must call a doctor.

86
00:10:17,721 --> 00:10:19,041
There's nothing we can do.

87
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,521
It's time to keep a cool head,
Tokyo.

88
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:25,801
I'm not just thinking about Moscow.

89
00:10:27,121 --> 00:10:29,921
-I'm going to call the Professor.
-The Professor is gone!

90
00:10:30,321 --> 00:10:32,561
I've called many times.
He's not in the hangar.

91
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:34,081
I don't know where he is!

92
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:39,001
-We must call Inspector Murillo.
-We can't do it!

93
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:40,841
You know.
It's not part of the plan.

94
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:41,841
What plan?

95
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:44,441
You know what my plan was?

96
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:47,081
To kill you.

97
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:50,241
But Moscow is the one dying.

98
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:53,801
So don't tell me what's not
part of the fucking plan.

99
00:11:14,681 --> 00:11:16,401
This is Colonel Prieto speaking.

100
00:11:17,121 --> 00:11:19,361
"I'd like to speak
with Inspector Murillo, please."

101
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:21,921
The CNI has taken charge.

102
00:11:23,321 --> 00:11:24,321
Colonel,

103
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:25,801
It's Fonollosa.

104
00:11:26,641 --> 00:11:28,361
I'd like to ask
what you're wearing

105
00:11:28,441 --> 00:11:30,041
but there's no time for chit-chat,

106
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:32,281
since you just put three bullets
in our man.

107
00:11:32,361 --> 00:11:33,921
I want a surgeon in here.

108
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:35,201
Now.

109
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:36,841
"Do you know what I want?"

110
00:11:37,401 --> 00:11:39,121
For you to stop fucking with me.

111
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:41,841
You pulled Silene Oliveira
out of a police van

112
00:11:41,921 --> 00:11:43,561
and got her back in the building.

113
00:11:43,641 --> 00:11:46,441
"You placed explosive devices that,
thank God,

114
00:11:46,921 --> 00:11:47,761
didn't work.

115
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:50,841
Do you really think you're
in a position to make requests?"

116
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:54,801
Look,
it was a clean rescue on our part.

117
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,001
You guys started shooting.

118
00:11:57,481 --> 00:12:00,161
"It would be nice of you
to help save this man's life."

119
00:12:00,681 --> 00:12:01,601
Listen carefully.

120
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:06,881
If you want to save him,
bring him through the main door, unarmed,

121
00:12:06,961 --> 00:12:09,281
"...and an ambulance will be waiting for him."

122
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,081
We're not turning our man in,
Colonel.

123
00:12:11,601 --> 00:12:14,241
"Then you'll have another corpse
on your hands."

124
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:20,561
Have you tracked down the inspector?

125
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:21,841
We're working on it.

126
00:13:00,721 --> 00:13:03,721
SAN GABRIEL HILLS, 12 LOT SPECIAL,
DARE TO DREAM OF YOUR NEW LIFE

127
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:04,521
Helsinki,

128
00:14:04,641 --> 00:14:05,681
how does it look?

129
00:14:09,241 --> 00:14:10,481
It's not a shot in the leg.

130
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:13,521
The stomach is a bad area,
Moscow.

131
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:14,641
Very bad.

132
00:14:15,761 --> 00:14:17,281
We need a surgeon.

133
00:14:18,361 --> 00:14:19,321
Honestly,

134
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:21,681
how much time do we have?

135
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,201
Hours.

136
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:27,401
Eleven.

137
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:29,681
Twelve, thirteen.

138
00:14:29,921 --> 00:14:32,281
Without a surgeon
there's nothing we can do.

139
00:14:35,721 --> 00:14:37,281
How many times was I hit?

140
00:14:41,161 --> 00:14:42,201
Three, Dad.

141
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:44,681
Three times.

142
00:14:46,521 --> 00:14:48,321
Some mess I've got down there.

143
00:14:52,161 --> 00:14:53,321
-Moscow...

144
00:14:53,761 --> 00:14:55,921
-What?
-They won't send in a surgical team.

145
00:14:56,201 --> 00:14:59,161
But we have an ambulance out there
to take you to the hospital.

146
00:15:04,441 --> 00:15:07,521
You can tell them
that they can go fuck themselves,

147
00:15:07,721 --> 00:15:09,721
because I'm not going back to jail.

148
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:15,881
That hole,

149
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:17,441
it's almost finished,

150
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:19,241
through to the other side.

151
00:15:20,401 --> 00:15:21,801
That's ten hours of work.

152
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:25,121
Get digging.

153
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:28,681
And I'll hang in here, okay?

154
00:15:29,401 --> 00:15:30,361
Hang in there, Dad.

155
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:33,401
I'll create that tunnel
even if I have to headbutt my way through.

156
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:34,401
People,

157
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:36,041
we're getting out of here.

158
00:15:49,761 --> 00:15:51,441
"There was a shoot-out. What happened?"

159
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:52,841
Moscow is full of holes.

160
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:54,681
"Three gunshots."

161
00:15:56,521 --> 00:15:57,401
Where?

162
00:15:57,841 --> 00:15:58,841
"In the stomach.

163
00:15:59,641 --> 00:16:01,281
I don't think they hit his liver.

164
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:03,201
I don't know about the rest."

165
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:09,681
How is it looking?

166
00:16:11,681 --> 00:16:12,721
Fucked.

167
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:15,881
But Moscow says he won't go out.

168
00:16:15,961 --> 00:16:17,841
That we can finish the tunnel soon.

169
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:20,801
I have the Serbs here.

170
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:23,321
We're going to start digging
from this side too.

171
00:16:23,641 --> 00:16:25,801
And I'll find the Ukrainian doctor.

172
00:16:27,841 --> 00:16:30,121
Anyway you have to get out
as soon as possible.

173
00:16:31,921 --> 00:16:33,281
I've been discovered, Andrés.

174
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:37,361
"I don't know how long before the
police show up."

175
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:44,881
Any news?

176
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:47,601
What's the matter?

177
00:16:49,721 --> 00:16:50,681
What's he doing here?

178
00:16:52,681 --> 00:16:55,081
Will someone tell me what's going on?

179
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:57,721
Did you know Sergio Marquina,
the Professor, is Salva?

180
00:16:57,801 --> 00:16:59,361
The mastermind of the heist.

181
00:16:59,441 --> 00:17:01,921
The man you've been seeing
at the bar for five days.

182
00:17:03,521 --> 00:17:04,481
Yes.

183
00:17:05,321 --> 00:17:06,801
I found out a few hours ago.

184
00:17:07,201 --> 00:17:08,561
You got a call from that man.

185
00:17:09,641 --> 00:17:11,481
He called
from the station in Canillas,

186
00:17:11,561 --> 00:17:12,761
where he was in custody.

187
00:17:13,881 --> 00:17:15,281
Minutes later you arrived.

188
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:17,681
You made a scene
to get him out of there,

189
00:17:17,761 --> 00:17:19,321
and destroyed his fingerprints.

190
00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:20,961
I didn't know who he was.

191
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,121
The evidence you destroyed

192
00:17:23,201 --> 00:17:25,401
identified him
breaking into the police car

193
00:17:25,481 --> 00:17:28,481
to threaten the Russian
in order to avoid the facial composite.

194
00:17:28,601 --> 00:17:30,281
The man who erased the fingerprints

195
00:17:30,361 --> 00:17:32,161
on the car found in the junkyard

196
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:34,761
from which Ángel took a teaspoon
that proved him guilty

197
00:17:34,841 --> 00:17:36,281
before having a fatal accident.

198
00:17:36,361 --> 00:17:39,121
You took him
to the gang's house in Toledo, right?

199
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:40,401
You put him in my car,

200
00:17:40,481 --> 00:17:43,241
where I kept the only legal evidence
I found in the house.

201
00:17:43,721 --> 00:17:46,401
The paper from the fireplace
and the evidence disappeared.

202
00:17:46,481 --> 00:17:49,481
Apparently after leaving
Inspector Vicuña unconscious,

203
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:52,561
and when Ángel did his job
and reported his suspicions,

204
00:17:53,361 --> 00:17:55,161
you dropped him
from the investigation.

205
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:58,761
And to top it off,
while destroying your partner,

206
00:17:58,841 --> 00:18:00,921
you were screwing
the leader of the gang.

207
00:18:07,601 --> 00:18:08,481
Fine.

208
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:09,921
Fine.

209
00:18:11,201 --> 00:18:12,041
First of all,

210
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:14,161
that man can't be here.

211
00:18:14,801 --> 00:18:16,081
He has a restraining order.

212
00:18:16,481 --> 00:18:19,561
So if he's not 500 feet away from me
in five minutes,

213
00:18:19,761 --> 00:18:21,161
I'll have him arrested.

214
00:18:36,521 --> 00:18:38,161
I didn't know who he was.

215
00:18:39,561 --> 00:18:40,441
And I'll prove it.

216
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:43,121
I can tell you where he's hiding.

217
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:48,841
TUESDAY 10:15 PM

218
00:18:52,561 --> 00:18:55,321
3 HOURS AFTER THE SHOOT-OUT

219
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,601
"What the fuck did you do?"

220
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:01,201
You left my mother at a roundabout?

221
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:04,241
"You had me believe she was a bitch."

222
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:06,841
It was her or us.

223
00:19:08,921 --> 00:19:10,161
"I won't break your skull

224
00:19:10,241 --> 00:19:11,961
because we need you to get out."

225
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:13,561
When we get out,

226
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,761
you and I are nothing.

227
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:18,241
Two strangers,

228
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:19,921
Denver

229
00:19:20,001 --> 00:19:21,321
and Moscow.

230
00:19:21,401 --> 00:19:22,281
Fuck!

231
00:19:52,721 --> 00:19:55,161
Can anyone tell me
what the fuck this is?

232
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:56,321
Please,

233
00:19:56,801 --> 00:19:58,481
not like that.

234
00:19:58,641 --> 00:20:01,201
We said little rolls
of a million each, please.

235
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:03,281
Max it out, damn it.

236
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:09,641
We'll keep printing bills
for a few more hours.

237
00:20:09,721 --> 00:20:12,361
Then stop the machines and erase the logs.

238
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:15,321
I want everybody working to the max!

239
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:16,881
We're getting out of here!

240
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:19,401
That's right.

241
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:22,201
I've been told of another very good place

242
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:23,921
at the Federal Reserve.

243
00:20:24,401 --> 00:20:25,561
Come here a minute.

244
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:29,841
How's Moscow?

245
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:32,201
He's stable.

246
00:20:32,921 --> 00:20:34,881
We still have a few hours,
don't we?

247
00:20:35,721 --> 00:20:37,801
Should we start making 500 euro bills?

248
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:42,721
The 500 euro bills are
for Russians and tacky people.

249
00:20:42,801 --> 00:20:44,601
I'm not Russian. Do I look tacky?

250
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,001
My tastes might be questionable but...

251
00:20:47,081 --> 00:20:49,201
Berlin, are we printing them or not?

252
00:20:51,601 --> 00:20:53,201
100 and 200 euro bills.

253
00:20:53,881 --> 00:20:54,841
Torres!

254
00:20:56,241 --> 00:20:57,201
Torres,

255
00:20:58,721 --> 00:20:59,921
stop the machines,

256
00:21:00,481 --> 00:21:01,681
change the plates,

257
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:04,281
and start making 100 and 200 bills.

258
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:05,481
Yes, ma'am.

259
00:21:19,281 --> 00:21:21,601
You like to jump puddles
from one stone to another

260
00:21:22,401 --> 00:21:24,481
and every time you step, a stone sinks.

261
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:30,361
"You're leaving dead bodies
by the roadside."

262
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:36,681
Was it your idea or your boyfriend's
to rob the armoured car?

263
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:50,481
Well, now your boyfriend is dead

264
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:52,681
and so is your mother.

265
00:21:55,841 --> 00:21:59,081
I'm sure you knew the pain
you were causing your mother.

266
00:22:33,801 --> 00:22:35,841
I thought I'd never see you again.

267
00:22:38,721 --> 00:22:39,641
What's the matter?

268
00:22:40,721 --> 00:22:41,601
He told me.

269
00:22:43,441 --> 00:22:45,361
I leave dead bodies behind
wherever I go.

270
00:22:47,521 --> 00:22:49,281
Berlin kicked me out
and I came back.

271
00:22:50,481 --> 00:22:52,721
And I've put everyone's lives in
danger.

272
00:22:53,881 --> 00:22:55,881
I just had to come back, didn't I?

273
00:22:58,521 --> 00:23:00,001
And now the dead body is Moscow.

274
00:23:00,401 --> 00:23:01,961
Moscow isn't a dead body, okay?

275
00:23:04,761 --> 00:23:05,841
He'll make it.

276
00:23:06,441 --> 00:23:08,521
And we'll get out of here together.

277
00:23:10,401 --> 00:23:12,761
I'm a black cat
that curses the people it crosses.

278
00:23:12,841 --> 00:23:13,681
No.

279
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:15,681
You're a black panther,

280
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,441
my black panther.

281
00:23:42,961 --> 00:23:43,961
How are you?

282
00:23:44,721 --> 00:23:46,121
Right now I'm fucking great.

283
00:23:47,481 --> 00:23:49,561
You have no fucking idea
how much I love you.

284
00:23:49,921 --> 00:23:50,881
No fucking idea.

285
00:23:51,441 --> 00:23:52,561
I love you too.

286
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:10,121
I've missed you.

287
00:24:11,681 --> 00:24:13,921
Let's start getting the money out of here.

288
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:15,881
Come on, come on!

289
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,241
The ones in other room, too!

290
00:24:25,441 --> 00:24:27,281
Ariadna, Ariadna.

291
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:29,561
Not you.

292
00:24:29,881 --> 00:24:30,761
Come.

293
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:32,921
Put that down.

294
00:24:56,321 --> 00:24:57,201
Denver.

295
00:24:58,601 --> 00:24:59,641
Denver!

296
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:01,641
Listen,

297
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:04,081
Denver, you have to stop.

298
00:25:04,841 --> 00:25:06,681
-It's pointless.
-What?

299
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:09,561
Put the pick down

300
00:25:10,521 --> 00:25:12,921
and convince your father
to turn himself in.

301
00:25:13,361 --> 00:25:15,761
He has to get to a hospital.
He can't wait.

302
00:25:15,841 --> 00:25:19,361
This tunnel is the only way
out and I'm leaving with my father.

303
00:25:20,801 --> 00:25:21,721
You know why?

304
00:25:23,761 --> 00:25:24,601
Why?

305
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:27,841
Because when we get out of here

306
00:25:28,641 --> 00:25:30,841
you won't be wearing
a red jumpsuit anymore.

307
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:33,041
You'll be dressed in white,

308
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,121
gorgeous.

309
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:36,641
And I'll be waiting at the altar.

310
00:25:37,241 --> 00:25:39,201
And I need him to be there by my side,

311
00:25:39,561 --> 00:25:40,481
and to see it.

312
00:25:40,921 --> 00:25:43,961
For him to grab me by the shoulder
and get goosebumps, okay?

313
00:25:44,321 --> 00:25:45,241
I'm not stopping.

314
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:46,841
I'm not stopping.

315
00:25:47,681 --> 00:25:49,441
So, shall we do this?

316
00:25:49,921 --> 00:25:50,841
Let's do this!

317
00:25:53,441 --> 00:25:54,561
-Let's do it!
-Let's go.

318
00:25:58,881 --> 00:26:00,041
Just a bit more!

319
00:26:00,121 --> 00:26:02,521
-Just a little more, damn it!
-Just a bit, Rio!

320
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:03,561
Less than two metres!

321
00:26:06,321 --> 00:26:08,281
Have you thought about my proposal?

322
00:26:12,281 --> 00:26:15,841
A short but passionate love story

323
00:26:17,281 --> 00:26:18,321
in a tropical country.

324
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:23,601
And a proper inheritance.

325
00:26:24,961 --> 00:26:27,281
800 million euros
that go to you.

326
00:26:31,321 --> 00:26:33,281
That's the least important part,
Berlin.

327
00:26:34,241 --> 00:26:37,081
I like the idea of going away with you

328
00:26:39,321 --> 00:26:40,801
but it makes me sad because

329
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:42,161
you're going to die.

330
00:26:50,641 --> 00:26:52,401
You'll make a gorgeous widow.

331
00:26:58,881 --> 00:27:00,241
We have to get married.

332
00:27:00,521 --> 00:27:01,641
Right, Ariadna?

333
00:27:04,561 --> 00:27:05,681
I've never done it

334
00:27:06,641 --> 00:27:07,641
dressed in white

335
00:27:08,841 --> 00:27:09,801
at night.

336
00:27:10,961 --> 00:27:12,401
How about on a beach,

337
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:18,281
under the stars, in a wild ritual
with lots of light,

338
00:27:19,801 --> 00:27:20,801
and lots of fire.

339
00:27:23,121 --> 00:27:24,081
Beautiful.

340
00:27:34,841 --> 00:27:36,561
Would you marry me, Ariadna?

341
00:27:43,721 --> 00:27:47,121
I'm sure some people think
that living with a dying man

342
00:27:47,561 --> 00:27:48,481
is boring and

343
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:49,761
they're wrong.

344
00:27:50,641 --> 00:27:51,761
It's the opposite.

345
00:27:52,481 --> 00:27:53,801
It's going all in.

346
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:05,521
Driving without the seatbelt on.

347
00:28:07,921 --> 00:28:09,881
Riding a motorcycle without a
helmet.

348
00:28:11,921 --> 00:28:14,041
Scuba diving without an oxygen tank.

349
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:19,281
Letting go of the reins for good,
no limits.

350
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:25,081
What about babies?

351
00:28:28,561 --> 00:28:32,641
What do you think? Some mini-Berlins
running along the beach.

352
00:28:35,721 --> 00:28:36,641
Just kidding.

353
00:28:57,601 --> 00:29:00,521
So the address you gave us
is where Mr. Marquina

354
00:29:00,601 --> 00:29:02,681
supposedly set up his operations centre.

355
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,321
In that cider bar, right?

356
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:05,961
Yes.

357
00:29:06,521 --> 00:29:07,401
What's this?

358
00:29:08,601 --> 00:29:09,841
It's a warehouse.

359
00:29:16,361 --> 00:29:17,721
There's nothing in there.

360
00:29:17,801 --> 00:29:19,441
A beat-up car, junk.

361
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:22,401
But no sign of an operations centre.

362
00:29:27,561 --> 00:29:29,721
Are you sure about the address
you gave us?

363
00:29:31,001 --> 00:29:31,921
Of course I am.

364
00:29:32,241 --> 00:29:33,481
I was there.

365
00:29:37,321 --> 00:29:38,761
What were you doing there?

366
00:29:42,841 --> 00:29:43,761
Making love.

367
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:54,561
"Our first rule was no names,

368
00:29:55,801 --> 00:29:57,361
no personal relationships.

369
00:29:58,401 --> 00:30:01,201
The Professor had envisaged
a heist with no attachments,

370
00:30:02,121 --> 00:30:03,281
but when I saw him there,

371
00:30:04,361 --> 00:30:05,281
smiling at me,

372
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,081
I realised that he was
the closest thing to a father

373
00:30:08,161 --> 00:30:09,601
that I had ever had."

374
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:11,681
What's so funny,

375
00:30:12,201 --> 00:30:13,081
big guy?

376
00:30:13,961 --> 00:30:15,201
Your bright ideas.

377
00:30:16,761 --> 00:30:17,881
Escaping

378
00:30:19,201 --> 00:30:21,041
just to come back to the building.

379
00:30:21,521 --> 00:30:22,441
You know it.

380
00:30:23,401 --> 00:30:24,961
Dressed like a cop and everything.

381
00:30:25,481 --> 00:30:26,321
Like James Bond.

382
00:30:27,961 --> 00:30:29,721
That must have really pissed them off.

383
00:30:35,681 --> 00:30:36,561
He's shaking.

384
00:30:36,841 --> 00:30:40,001
Moscow, Moscow. Hey.

385
00:30:41,161 --> 00:30:43,481
He's as white as the snow in Stalingrad.

386
00:30:44,001 --> 00:30:45,081
He's got a pulse of 35.

387
00:30:46,161 --> 00:30:48,561
He needs a transfusion.
Get the plasma.

388
00:30:48,761 --> 00:30:49,921
-Moscow.
-Come on.

389
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:51,521
O-negative.

390
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:52,761
Hey.

391
00:30:53,681 --> 00:30:54,681
-Over here.
-Moscow.

392
00:30:56,161 --> 00:30:57,881
There we go, you're with us.

393
00:30:59,481 --> 00:31:01,121
It's okay. Are you okay?

394
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:03,961
It's okay, you're with us.

395
00:31:06,001 --> 00:31:07,681
You're right here with us, okay?

396
00:31:08,861 --> 00:31:11,461
WEDNESDAY 07:02 AM

397
00:31:16,581 --> 00:31:19,341
11 HOURS AFTER THE SHOOT-OUT

398
00:32:07,201 --> 00:32:08,801
How's the tunnel going?

399
00:32:10,641 --> 00:32:11,841
We're really close.

400
00:32:24,081 --> 00:32:25,241
Hey, dear.

401
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:27,281
Girl.

402
00:32:28,841 --> 00:32:30,561
Why don't you get some rest?

403
00:32:32,761 --> 00:32:34,041
-Alright?
-Alright.

404
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:36,561
Let's go.

405
00:32:55,081 --> 00:32:56,961
Here you go, keep working.

406
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:42,721
Inspector.

407
00:33:43,081 --> 00:33:45,561
"I'm afraid she can't answer the phone."

408
00:33:45,761 --> 00:33:49,001
She's under investigation for
collaboration in the heist

409
00:33:49,081 --> 00:33:50,801
"and obstruction of justice.

410
00:33:51,001 --> 00:33:52,761
But surely you already know that,

411
00:33:52,841 --> 00:33:55,441
I mean, since you have
such a special relationship."

412
00:33:55,881 --> 00:33:57,801
We know who you are, Salva.

413
00:33:58,321 --> 00:33:59,401
Or should I say,

414
00:33:59,841 --> 00:34:01,041
Sergio Marquina.

415
00:34:01,521 --> 00:34:05,361
"So there's no need for you to use
that GPS voice anymore."

416
00:34:17,521 --> 00:34:18,561
"Colonel Prieto,"

417
00:34:21,641 --> 00:34:24,561
We have a man dying here
because of your gunfire.

418
00:34:26,401 --> 00:34:28,041
If you don't send a doctor in now,

419
00:34:28,721 --> 00:34:30,281
you'll have signed his death sentence.

420
00:34:30,721 --> 00:34:33,121
"The only one who signed
his sentence is you."

421
00:34:33,281 --> 00:34:37,601
Not to mention all the other lives
you're destroying with this heist.

422
00:34:37,801 --> 00:34:39,641
Including that of your friend, the inspector.

423
00:34:40,761 --> 00:34:43,041
How can you bear having
that on your conscience?

424
00:34:43,161 --> 00:34:44,881
Look, if you want

425
00:34:45,601 --> 00:34:48,721
to chat about conscience,
we can do so later.

426
00:34:49,481 --> 00:34:51,081
But right now we need a doctor.

427
00:34:51,481 --> 00:34:53,281
There will be no 'later', Mr. Marquina.

428
00:34:54,161 --> 00:34:55,841
We know you're close.

429
00:34:56,641 --> 00:34:58,881
And we know the location
of the 3 antennae

430
00:34:58,961 --> 00:35:02,921
that recorded your calls
to the inspector over the last five days.

431
00:35:04,281 --> 00:35:06,361
"We'll search every house.

432
00:35:06,921 --> 00:35:10,001
And when you least expect it,
we'll be knocking on your door."

433
00:35:11,281 --> 00:35:15,641
So stop complicating things
and surrender.

434
00:35:17,561 --> 00:35:19,121
Like I told the inspector,

435
00:35:20,481 --> 00:35:22,761
surrendering was never an option.

436
00:35:25,161 --> 00:35:26,281
I'll be here waiting.

437
00:35:35,641 --> 00:35:38,041
Not everyone is letting us
into their homes.

438
00:35:38,201 --> 00:35:41,081
Many people are on their side.
They're heroes on TV.

439
00:35:41,161 --> 00:35:42,961
We're the guys who want to catch them.

440
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:45,881
-Call Judge Andrade
and request a search warrant.

441
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:47,921
-We can't bust into 10.000 homes.

442
00:35:48,201 --> 00:35:52,881
The antennae cover an 850-metre radius.
We have to narrow it down.

443
00:35:52,961 --> 00:35:54,721
Fine, we'll narrow it down.

444
00:35:55,721 --> 00:35:58,681
But call Judge Andrade
and request a search warrant.

445
00:35:59,121 --> 00:36:01,081
I see you've got it all under control.

446
00:36:01,281 --> 00:36:03,161
I don't understand what I'm doing here.

447
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:06,161
-Am I under arrest?
-No, you're not under arrest.

448
00:36:06,241 --> 00:36:07,521
You're being investigated.

449
00:36:07,921 --> 00:36:08,801
Okay,

450
00:36:09,281 --> 00:36:10,401
then I'm leaving.

451
00:36:10,481 --> 00:36:11,361
Inspector.

452
00:36:11,681 --> 00:36:14,361
Before you leave,
turn in your badge and your gun.

453
00:36:23,561 --> 00:36:25,641
Tap my phone if you want!

454
00:36:35,281 --> 00:36:36,441
Wait, wait.

455
00:36:37,721 --> 00:36:40,041
You go ahead,
I'll get you a new jumpsuit.

456
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:45,881
Hi.

457
00:37:19,761 --> 00:37:20,761
Ari.

458
00:37:26,321 --> 00:37:28,241
Why did you sabotage the escape plan?

459
00:37:30,841 --> 00:37:31,921
Because of Denver?

460
00:37:35,841 --> 00:37:38,681
You hit Arturo
because you two have something.

461
00:37:41,561 --> 00:37:43,441
-Mónica, did he force you?
-No.

462
00:37:51,521 --> 00:37:52,681
Why are you with him?

463
00:37:55,161 --> 00:37:56,321
Because I love him.

464
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:01,321
Because I love him, I know

465
00:38:01,881 --> 00:38:03,401
it may sound ridiculous.

466
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:05,721
You might think it's crazy but...

467
00:38:06,681 --> 00:38:07,561
it's real.

468
00:38:08,441 --> 00:38:09,441
It's real, Ari.

469
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:12,081
It's the first time someone has

470
00:38:13,081 --> 00:38:16,041
looked me in the eye and is honest.

471
00:38:17,321 --> 00:38:19,481
He really loves me.

472
00:38:22,641 --> 00:38:23,521
And you...

473
00:38:25,321 --> 00:38:26,441
you're with Berlin?

474
00:38:35,441 --> 00:38:36,881
Just for survival.

475
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:43,201
I thought they were killing people.

476
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:47,921
And that they had killed you too.

477
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:50,561
I thought I was saving myself.

478
00:38:50,641 --> 00:38:51,481
Come here.

479
00:38:56,841 --> 00:38:59,601
Berlin disgusts me, he makes me sick.

480
00:38:59,961 --> 00:39:02,321
And now that arsehole thinks
I have feelings for him,

481
00:39:02,401 --> 00:39:04,001
that we are living a love story.

482
00:39:04,441 --> 00:39:06,441
He wants me to marry him
when we get out,

483
00:39:06,521 --> 00:39:07,721
to take care of him.

484
00:39:08,321 --> 00:39:09,241
He's sick.

485
00:39:09,321 --> 00:39:10,201
I know.

486
00:39:12,721 --> 00:39:14,001
And are you going to do it?

487
00:39:15,841 --> 00:39:18,001
It'll only be a year.
I don't know, we're going

488
00:39:18,961 --> 00:39:20,241
to travel the world.

489
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:22,081
Living like kings.

490
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:24,841
And going...

491
00:39:25,521 --> 00:39:27,201
to fancy places and that's it.

492
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:31,801
Thousands of people
accept these proposals every day.

493
00:39:32,401 --> 00:39:33,321
Ari...

494
00:39:34,841 --> 00:39:36,161
But is it worth it?

495
00:39:38,681 --> 00:39:40,961
I'm going to keep all of his money.

496
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:45,001
He fucked up my life, Mónica.

497
00:39:45,321 --> 00:39:48,641
I take 4 tranquilisers a day
just to be able to bear his presence.

498
00:39:49,961 --> 00:39:51,041
He raped me.

499
00:39:51,801 --> 00:39:52,761
He raped me.

500
00:39:53,161 --> 00:39:55,441
When he's by my side
and he can no longer move,

501
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:56,801
when he has only me,

502
00:39:56,961 --> 00:40:00,521
I'll tell him what a son of bitch he is
for all he's done to me.

503
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:30,521
The calls made by the suspect
over the last five days

504
00:40:30,601 --> 00:40:33,761
were recorded by these 3 antennae,
located here,

505
00:40:34,321 --> 00:40:38,841
here and here. Except the one he made
from the Canillas police station.

506
00:40:39,841 --> 00:40:41,801
You were right. It's a wide radius.

507
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:45,281
Gómez, ask telecoms
to triangulate the signal

508
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:47,721
to limit the suspect's area of activity.

509
00:40:49,401 --> 00:40:51,561
Everything would be easier
if Ángel was here.

510
00:40:51,961 --> 00:40:54,921
He's the only one who knows
the exact location of the hideout.

511
00:41:29,121 --> 00:41:31,361
"The inspector was
at the edge of the abyss,

512
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:34,481
balancing to avoid
falling into it for good.

513
00:41:35,321 --> 00:41:37,361
Thinking about how ridiculous it was

514
00:41:37,441 --> 00:41:41,401
to have gone from inspector to suspect
in a couple of minutes."

515
00:41:57,721 --> 00:42:00,961
"And she decided to do what her mother
had so often told her to do.

516
00:42:03,281 --> 00:42:04,921
Chase after the bad guys."

517
00:42:21,141 --> 00:42:25,021
"Raquel had sniffed a lead.
And so, without a Deputy Inspector

518
00:42:25,101 --> 00:42:28,461
to assist with the investigation,
she opted for other help."

519
00:42:28,721 --> 00:42:30,441
Look, Paula's markers,

520
00:42:30,521 --> 00:42:32,521
with chewed-up caps,
like you used to do.

521
00:42:32,601 --> 00:42:33,841
Thanks, Mum. Give me one.

522
00:42:35,081 --> 00:42:38,921
So, on the day of our first date
I arrived 25 minutes early.

523
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:40,721
I called him and he said

524
00:42:40,801 --> 00:42:42,721
he was heading out right then.

525
00:42:42,801 --> 00:42:43,721
-See you soon.

526
00:42:43,801 --> 00:42:45,161
We met

527
00:42:45,961 --> 00:42:47,281
here, at Hanoi.

528
00:42:48,521 --> 00:42:51,801
He walked there
and it only took five to seven minutes.

529
00:42:51,881 --> 00:42:56,361
Pity, for once you land a good guy...
Why do you care how long it took?

530
00:42:56,641 --> 00:42:59,001
To know how far away
from the café he was.

531
00:42:59,561 --> 00:43:00,521
DISTANCE WALKING, 5 - 7 MINS,

532
00:43:00,601 --> 00:43:01,441
500 METRES APPROX.

533
00:43:01,521 --> 00:43:05,401
In that timeframe he could have
travelled 500 metres at best.

534
00:43:08,321 --> 00:43:09,401
More or less.

535
00:43:11,681 --> 00:43:13,201
His hideout

536
00:43:13,281 --> 00:43:14,401
is in this area.

537
00:43:14,881 --> 00:43:17,641
He took one of these streets
to get to the café.

538
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:20,041
I'm sure one of the surveillance cameras
taped it.

539
00:43:20,121 --> 00:43:22,361
I have to narrow it down.
Give me another one.

540
00:43:27,601 --> 00:43:29,481
I'll get the recordings
from that area

541
00:43:29,561 --> 00:43:31,201
to figure out the route he took.

542
00:43:33,761 --> 00:43:35,681
Are you sure about this?

543
00:43:36,241 --> 00:43:37,081
Mum,

544
00:43:38,361 --> 00:43:40,521
I'll find him no matter what it takes.

545
00:43:40,601 --> 00:43:41,481
Be careful, dear.

546
00:44:12,401 --> 00:44:13,881
We have a badly-injured man.

547
00:44:13,961 --> 00:44:16,961
3 gunshots to the abdomen
and it's been a few hours.

548
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,241
Where is he?

549
00:44:18,441 --> 00:44:20,681
I don't know how long
before I get him out.

550
00:44:20,761 --> 00:44:21,641
And listen,

551
00:44:22,721 --> 00:44:24,721
the police are tracking me down.

552
00:44:26,881 --> 00:44:28,201
Is it safe for them?

553
00:44:28,481 --> 00:44:31,001
They already know
and they agreed to their part.

554
00:44:31,521 --> 00:44:32,921
Yours would be ten million.

555
00:44:35,921 --> 00:44:38,081
I need abdominal laparotomy gear,

556
00:44:38,321 --> 00:44:41,361
a medical ventilator
and surgical equipment.

557
00:44:42,561 --> 00:44:43,521
Can you get it?

558
00:44:44,121 --> 00:44:45,081
I'll take care of it.

559
00:44:48,441 --> 00:44:51,041
WEDNESDAY
09:36 AM

560
00:44:56,921 --> 00:44:59,681
14 HOURS AFTER THE SHOOT-OUT

561
00:45:07,761 --> 00:45:09,841
Good morning. Inspector Murillo.

562
00:45:10,761 --> 00:45:14,441
I need the footage from the cameras
from October 23rd.

563
00:45:21,441 --> 00:45:22,721
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

564
00:45:23,241 --> 00:45:24,121
Bye.

565
00:45:37,921 --> 00:45:38,801
Thank you.

566
00:47:07,001 --> 00:47:08,841
Did you find out anything yet?

567
00:47:10,081 --> 00:47:11,361
I'm starting to draw

568
00:47:12,081 --> 00:47:13,921
the route he took to the café.

569
00:47:15,641 --> 00:47:17,641
Look, that narrows the area down

570
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,881
to this triangle.

571
00:47:21,281 --> 00:47:22,841
If he went to the Hanoi this way,

572
00:47:23,601 --> 00:47:25,761
His hideout is very close, in this area.

573
00:47:26,801 --> 00:47:28,241
I have to go out again, Mum.

574
00:47:33,321 --> 00:47:35,961
The bulk of the calls were made
from this area.

575
00:47:36,441 --> 00:47:38,681
So the Professor must have
used these streets.

576
00:47:38,841 --> 00:47:42,001
Check the surveillance tapes
from this area.

577
00:47:42,521 --> 00:47:44,041
Get the judge to issue a warrant.

578
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,280
I told the kid.

579
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,280
What?

580
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,520
What I did to you.

581
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,480
That I abandoned you
at that roundabout in Martorell.

582
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,280
I went back to that roundabout

583
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:31,120
because I dreamed
you were wiping windshields

584
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,840
at those traffic lights.

585
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,320
I got in the car and drove.

586
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,760
For hours and hours.

587
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,160
Because I wanted to fix my mistake.

588
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,040
Don't talk. Rest.

589
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:55,680
I showed your picture
to everyone who passed-by.

590
00:49:02,221 --> 00:49:03,101
And now...

591
00:49:03,981 --> 00:49:04,861
your son...

592
00:49:07,981 --> 00:49:09,181
told me he hates me.

593
00:49:14,821 --> 00:49:15,661
Your son

594
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:17,421
adores you.

595
00:49:20,021 --> 00:49:22,421
No matter what he says
in the heat of the moment.

596
00:49:22,821 --> 00:49:24,101
I know he doesn't hate you.

597
00:49:26,621 --> 00:49:27,781
Well, I deserve it.

598
00:49:30,621 --> 00:49:31,901
I took his mother from him.

599
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:33,021
No.

600
00:49:34,941 --> 00:49:36,421
No, you did great.

601
00:49:39,221 --> 00:49:40,701
You have a wonderful son.

602
00:49:43,701 --> 00:49:44,581
Strong.

603
00:49:46,061 --> 00:49:46,941
Noble.

604
00:49:48,941 --> 00:49:49,861
And that...

605
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:53,661
that's thanks to you.

606
00:49:55,541 --> 00:49:57,181
I did what I could, honey...

607
00:50:00,981 --> 00:50:02,661
He came out a little nuts, didn't he?

608
00:50:11,901 --> 00:50:12,781
I have never

609
00:50:13,501 --> 00:50:14,501
been as happy

610
00:50:16,381 --> 00:50:17,621
as the day I met you.

611
00:50:22,821 --> 00:50:24,781
If I have to go to some place now,

612
00:50:26,621 --> 00:50:27,981
I'd like it to be that one.

613
00:50:30,181 --> 00:50:31,301
The village festival.

614
00:50:35,821 --> 00:50:37,101
And dance with you,

615
00:50:37,941 --> 00:50:38,861
together

616
00:50:41,221 --> 00:50:42,181
with the lights.

617
00:50:43,581 --> 00:50:45,261
With the colourful lights.

618
00:50:48,581 --> 00:50:49,541
I love you.

619
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:51,421
I'm sorry.

620
00:50:51,821 --> 00:50:52,701
Forgive me.

621
00:50:57,781 --> 00:50:58,621
Forgive me.

622
00:51:15,901 --> 00:51:16,741
I'm sorry.

623
00:51:18,741 --> 00:51:20,061
I'm sorry.

624
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:23,741
I'm sorry.

625
00:51:31,341 --> 00:51:32,261
I'm so sorry.

626
00:54:26,381 --> 00:54:28,021
-What are you doing?
-Listen!

627
00:54:37,101 --> 00:54:38,021
Do you hear that?

628
00:54:39,421 --> 00:54:40,381
It's them!

629
00:54:40,501 --> 00:54:42,141
-It's them.
-How much is left?

630
00:54:42,261 --> 00:54:43,581
30 or 40 centimetres.

631
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:45,261
Come on. Let's go!

632
00:54:45,901 --> 00:54:46,821
Hey!

633
00:54:47,661 --> 00:54:48,501
Hey!

634
00:54:48,781 --> 00:54:49,901
Professor!

635
00:55:06,821 --> 00:55:08,781
"We're here!"

636
00:55:11,061 --> 00:55:11,941
They're here.

637
00:55:12,301 --> 00:55:13,301
They're here!

638
00:55:13,941 --> 00:55:14,861
Hey!

639
00:55:15,461 --> 00:55:16,341
They're here!

640
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:20,301
They're right there!

641
00:55:20,421 --> 00:55:21,501
One more!

642
00:55:21,821 --> 00:55:22,781
One more!

643
00:55:23,101 --> 00:55:24,141
Professor!

644
00:56:18,741 --> 00:56:21,141
You're going to get ink on the wall, dear.

645
00:56:21,261 --> 00:56:22,141
Mum,

646
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:23,741
where are your car keys?

647
00:56:24,021 --> 00:56:26,301
That car hasn't been used
for a long time, dear.

648
00:56:26,861 --> 00:56:28,101
Well, it's about time

649
00:56:28,341 --> 00:56:29,421
we take it for a spin.

650
00:56:52,341 --> 00:56:53,621
Professor!

651
00:57:01,621 --> 00:57:03,181
Denver!

652
00:57:03,261 --> 00:57:05,581
Mónica, tell my father to hang in there.

653
00:57:05,741 --> 00:57:06,661
We're almost there!

654
00:57:06,741 --> 00:57:08,061
-Denver.
-We're almost done!

655
00:57:08,141 --> 00:57:09,101
-Go back up.
-What?

656
00:57:09,621 --> 00:57:11,101
-Go back up.
-Not now!

657
00:57:11,181 --> 00:57:12,461
-Listen, Denver!
-I'm not...

658
00:57:12,541 --> 00:57:13,461
-Denver!
-What?

659
00:57:13,741 --> 00:57:14,621
Go back up.

660
00:57:17,261 --> 00:57:18,541
You need to go back up, now.

661
00:57:25,021 --> 00:57:26,301
I'm not going back up now.

662
00:57:29,501 --> 00:57:31,101
Denver, stop!

663
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:32,781
I'm not going back up now!

664
00:57:33,141 --> 00:57:34,181
No!

665
00:57:35,621 --> 00:57:36,861
We're so close, Mónica.

666
00:57:36,941 --> 00:57:38,501
I know. Listen.

667
00:57:38,741 --> 00:57:40,501
You have to go back up, now.

668
00:57:41,021 --> 00:57:42,661
Do you understand? Look at me.

669
00:57:42,821 --> 00:57:44,381
If you don't go up now,

670
00:57:45,021 --> 00:57:47,061
you'll regret it for the rest
of your life.

671
00:57:47,221 --> 00:57:48,101
Go up.

672
00:57:49,581 --> 00:57:50,541
Go up.

673
00:57:53,821 --> 00:57:54,701
"Hey!"

674
00:57:54,821 --> 00:57:55,661
Let's go.

675
00:57:57,381 --> 00:57:58,221
Let's go.

676
00:57:59,821 --> 00:58:00,701
Let's go.

677
00:58:02,141 --> 00:58:03,061
Let's go.

678
00:58:04,101 --> 00:58:05,021
Let's go.

679
00:58:12,061 --> 00:58:13,101
"Come on!"

680
00:58:48,541 --> 00:58:49,701
I'm here, Dad.

681
00:58:52,221 --> 00:58:55,301
Just hold on a little longer
because we're going to make it.

682
00:58:55,861 --> 00:58:57,741
Right, Rio? We're digging like crazy.

683
00:58:57,901 --> 00:59:00,181
We already hear
the Serbs on the other side.

684
00:59:03,101 --> 00:59:04,021
Don't worry.

685
00:59:06,141 --> 00:59:07,061
Dad...

686
00:59:07,901 --> 00:59:08,861
-What?
-That...

687
00:59:11,621 --> 00:59:12,981
That thing I said about

688
00:59:14,381 --> 00:59:15,221
hating you...

689
00:59:19,021 --> 00:59:21,021
I could never feel that for you.

690
00:59:22,781 --> 00:59:24,221
I can't hate you, okay?

691
00:59:27,101 --> 00:59:28,741
It's okay. Don't worry.

692
00:59:28,821 --> 00:59:30,581
You did what you had to do with Mum.

693
00:59:33,421 --> 00:59:34,781
But I can't hate you.

694
00:59:44,221 --> 00:59:45,141
Mónica.

695
00:59:45,901 --> 00:59:46,741
Yes?

696
00:59:47,741 --> 00:59:50,021
I'll give you 300 million if you keep him.

697
00:59:52,261 --> 00:59:53,781
This guy's a headache.

698
00:59:56,381 --> 00:59:57,501
I brought him here,

699
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:00,061
But...

700
01:00:00,621 --> 01:00:02,261
now I'm going on vacation.

701
01:00:02,661 --> 01:00:03,581
Of course I will.

702
01:00:04,421 --> 01:00:05,341
Take care of him.

703
01:00:14,021 --> 01:00:14,981
Gentlemen.

704
01:00:18,621 --> 01:00:20,021
I haven't introduced myself.

705
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:26,021
Agustin Ramos.

706
01:00:29,421 --> 01:00:30,741
And it's been a pleasure.

707
01:00:43,621 --> 01:00:44,581
I love you.

708
01:00:47,901 --> 01:00:49,341
I love you too, Dad.

709
01:00:50,221 --> 01:00:51,101
So much.

710
01:00:52,421 --> 01:00:53,821
And I'm not letting you go.

711
01:00:54,021 --> 01:00:56,261
Rio, bring all the explosives
we have left.

712
01:00:56,341 --> 01:00:58,101
I'm blowing up that tunnel.

713
01:00:59,101 --> 01:01:00,021
Don't.

714
01:01:01,221 --> 01:01:02,581
If you blow the tunnel

715
01:01:03,781 --> 01:01:04,981
you'll bury us all.

716
01:01:06,501 --> 01:01:07,341
But Dad...

717
01:01:10,941 --> 01:01:12,341
You have to carry on.

718
01:01:14,221 --> 01:01:15,181
And remember...

719
01:01:15,781 --> 01:01:17,741
-Remember what?
-No rear-view mirrors.

720
01:01:20,101 --> 01:01:21,021
Alright.

721
01:01:22,621 --> 01:01:23,501
Alright.

722
01:01:25,421 --> 01:01:26,701
But I don't know if I can...

723
01:01:27,021 --> 01:01:27,941
I love you.

724
01:01:32,741 --> 01:01:33,701
I love you too.

725
01:01:35,381 --> 01:01:36,421
I love you too.

726
01:01:47,941 --> 01:01:49,981
It was for the absence of your lips

727
01:01:53,141 --> 01:01:55,181
That I cried for the first time

728
01:01:57,901 --> 01:01:59,461
And I cursed having met you

729
01:02:01,181 --> 01:02:04,221
For not being able to stop loving you

730
01:02:07,021 --> 01:02:09,461
You, my wife I wished to make

731
01:02:10,741 --> 01:02:12,461
And without love, I searched for luck

732
01:02:13,261 --> 01:02:15,821
I pulled out a gun

733
01:02:16,141 --> 01:02:19,701
And fate brought death

734
01:02:25,701 --> 01:02:29,381
"María, my life, my love

735
01:02:30,061 --> 01:02:31,461
I promised

736
01:02:32,021 --> 01:02:33,941
That I'd return

737
01:02:34,381 --> 01:02:38,181
But I will not return

738
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:42,381
I was caught by the police"

739
01:02:42,661 --> 01:02:46,381
María, my life, my love

740
01:02:46,861 --> 01:02:48,301
I will not stop

741
01:02:48,661 --> 01:02:50,861
Loving you

742
01:02:50,941 --> 01:02:54,181
The hugs that I lost

743
01:02:55,061 --> 01:02:59,821
You will not see me again.
