1
00:00:19,221 --> 00:00:20,141
Shall we close it?

2
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:25,261
Just like that?

3
00:00:26,021 --> 00:00:26,941
We should...

4
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:29,781
say a few words or something.

5
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,981
Our Father who art in Heaven,

6
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:53,701
hallowed be Thy name.

7
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:57,541
Thy will be done on earth,
as it is in Heaven.

8
00:00:58,021 --> 00:00:59,341
Thy Kingdom come.

9
00:00:59,621 --> 00:01:00,501
What?

10
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,221
You skipped a part.

11
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:05,221
After "hallowed be Thy name"
comes "Thy Kingdom come."

12
00:01:05,301 --> 00:01:06,981
What the hell does that matter?

13
00:01:07,781 --> 00:01:09,021
If you're going to pray,

14
00:01:09,101 --> 00:01:10,101
do it right.

15
00:01:10,181 --> 00:01:13,621
You think God is checking
if you're saying it right?

16
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:22,381
Give us this day our daily bread.

17
00:01:25,821 --> 00:01:27,061
And forgive us our debts,

18
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:30,981
as we also have forgiven our debtors.

19
00:01:33,221 --> 00:01:34,861
And lead us not into temptation,

20
00:01:36,861 --> 00:01:38,141
but deliver us from evil.

21
00:01:39,261 --> 00:01:40,181
Amen.

22
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:55,661
"There are moments in life

23
00:01:56,261 --> 00:01:58,741
where you should be able
to use a remote control

24
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:00,661
to just stop it.

25
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:04,141
Even if just for five minutes."

26
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:08,821
"But some things happen
with irreverent obscenity.

27
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:12,221
And there's nothing you can do.

28
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:14,621
On the one hand

29
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:17,061
we had just buried Moscow.

30
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:19,861
On the other,

31
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,061
we were opening the path to our freedom."

32
00:02:59,821 --> 00:03:02,101
All the shops in the area
said the same.

33
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,821
Inspector Murillo has seized footage

34
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:06,781
crucial for the investigation.

35
00:03:06,981 --> 00:03:09,981
Indisputable evidence
that she's collaborating in the heist.

36
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:11,901
Activate the intervention protocol.

37
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:13,581
Immediately.

38
00:03:15,021 --> 00:03:16,381
Gather your best men.

39
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:18,421
What about the hostages?

40
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:20,821
And Alison Parker,
or the international protocol?

41
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,261
What about public safety?

42
00:03:22,621 --> 00:03:25,061
Colonel, they have large calibre guns,

43
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:27,061
entrances loaded with explosives.

44
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:29,981
The hostages wear jumpsuits
and masks, like the thieves.

45
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:31,621
Impossible to tell them apart.

46
00:03:31,741 --> 00:03:33,821
It will be a bloodbath and you know it.

47
00:03:34,821 --> 00:03:35,981
And what do you suggest?

48
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:40,261
Let them get away,
holding hands with Inspector Murillo?

49
00:03:40,341 --> 00:03:42,901
Yes. Let them get out
and catch them on the outside.

50
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:48,501
Do you know where
public safety has led us?

51
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:50,981
You want me to tell you?

52
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:53,781
To us being the laughing stock.

53
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,341
Not only of Spain,
of the whole fucking world.

54
00:03:57,741 --> 00:04:00,661
The world's newscasts follow this story

55
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,141
as if it were the World Cup.

56
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:04,861
Do you want to be on TV
with the headline:

57
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:08,541
'The idiots in the police
let an escaped prisoner re-enter

58
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:11,541
the Royal Mint building
riding a motorbike'?

59
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:13,941
A motorbike!

60
00:04:18,781 --> 00:04:20,621
Do you like being the goddamn fool?

61
00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:21,621
-Excuse me...

62
00:04:22,021 --> 00:04:23,821
I didn't ask for your opinion.

63
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:26,421
The government has given
the order to intervene.

64
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:29,421
They have been in there for 125 hours,

65
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,581
and if by chance they were to escape

66
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:34,061
it would be a disgrace to this country.

67
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:35,341
-Excuse me...
-What?!

68
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:38,181
The State Prosecutor's Office
issued an arrest warrant

69
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:39,661
for Inspector Raquel Murillo.

70
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:42,001
She is under search and arrest.

71
00:04:45,181 --> 00:04:46,541
SHOP AVAILABLE

72
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:48,541
WEDNESDAY
3:35 PM

73
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:54,901
125 HOURS INTO THE ROBBERY

74
00:07:18,941 --> 00:07:20,701
-Where is he?
-In the warehouse.

75
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:51,221
I'm so sorry.

76
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:54,861
I'm so sorry.

77
00:08:17,141 --> 00:08:18,021
Come here.

78
00:08:21,821 --> 00:08:22,941
The one with the phone.

79
00:08:26,101 --> 00:08:26,981
Hello.

80
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:32,221
You can call her Stockholm if you want.

81
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:35,181
It can't be all tears, can it?

82
00:08:39,461 --> 00:08:40,381
Go on then.

83
00:08:41,661 --> 00:08:42,541
Go.

84
00:09:06,821 --> 00:09:08,541
Nine hundred and eighty four

85
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,541
million euros.

86
00:09:18,221 --> 00:09:20,701
Nine hundred and eighty four
million euros.

87
00:09:24,221 --> 00:09:26,621
Nine hundred and eighty four
million euros.

88
00:09:32,621 --> 00:09:34,701
Nine hundred and eighty four
million euros.

89
00:09:34,781 --> 00:09:35,621
Yes.

90
00:10:02,661 --> 00:10:04,501
Colonel, we're ready to go in.

91
00:10:04,901 --> 00:10:05,741
Good.

92
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:07,501
There's news from the tunnel.

93
00:10:13,301 --> 00:10:16,861
The GPR shows that they are
close to the sewer system.

94
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:19,421
We have a special operations unit
in the sewers.

95
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,501
"Entering the main drainage channel."

96
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:25,781
"Target distance 300 metres north."

97
00:10:26,261 --> 00:10:27,661
"Copy that. Standing by."

98
00:10:37,141 --> 00:10:38,021
Suárez.

99
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:41,541
We'll carry out
this operation together.

100
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:45,701
We'll use an enveloping tactic,
flanking them to force them into the hole.

101
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:47,421
In other words, a fucking sandwich.

102
00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:49,381
We'll push them from the inside

103
00:10:49,461 --> 00:10:52,061
so that they come out, then
catch them at the sewer bend.

104
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:53,861
They can't go back for cover.

105
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:56,381
We've got them in a mousetrap.

106
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,821
Now we have to find Inspector Murillo

107
00:11:00,421 --> 00:11:02,141
and her little boyfriend.

108
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,381
Lieutenant.

109
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:22,061
"Come on, go, go!"

110
00:11:36,341 --> 00:11:37,461
-"Squadron!"
-"Sir!"

111
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:38,421
-"Ready?"

112
00:11:38,501 --> 00:11:39,381
-"Yes, sir!"

113
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:41,181
Everyone moving the money.

114
00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:43,221
-We need to get out!
-"Very well."

115
00:11:43,301 --> 00:11:45,261
Assault units are
getting ready to come in.

116
00:11:45,341 --> 00:11:46,261
"We'll get on it."

117
00:11:48,981 --> 00:11:49,941
We're already in.

118
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,521
Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch!

119
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:13,781
Helsinki, this won't be the last
you hear from me, I swear!

120
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:17,901
When I get out
I'll sue the shit out of you,

121
00:12:18,181 --> 00:12:19,581
for cruelty, torture

122
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:22,141
and crimes against humanity, motherfucker!

123
00:12:31,981 --> 00:12:32,901
Little Arturo,

124
00:12:33,621 --> 00:12:34,941
we're going to the tunnel.

125
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:37,901
Your very important mission. Yes?

126
00:12:40,621 --> 00:12:41,541
It was fake.

127
00:12:44,301 --> 00:12:45,181
It was fake.

128
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:49,701
Stand up.

129
00:12:50,821 --> 00:12:51,781
Slowly.

130
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:57,581
Turn around!

131
00:13:03,421 --> 00:13:05,061
Now you're coming to the station.

132
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:08,821
And don't fucking move
or this time I will shoot you.

133
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:10,501
You know why?

134
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:13,981
Because I've gone for a little walk
in the countryside

135
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:15,901
and I've had time to think and I regret

136
00:13:15,981 --> 00:13:19,381
not shooting the biggest son of a bitch
that I ever came across in my life.

137
00:13:19,461 --> 00:13:20,341
Raquel, please.

138
00:13:20,461 --> 00:13:21,821
I'm not killing you

139
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,101
because I want you in prison for 30 years.

140
00:13:24,181 --> 00:13:25,301
And there,

141
00:13:25,661 --> 00:13:28,701
you get to ask whoever the fuck you want
what he's wearing.

142
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:41,781
Don't move.

143
00:13:42,741 --> 00:13:43,621
Don't move.

144
00:13:44,861 --> 00:13:45,901
Don't move!

145
00:14:01,421 --> 00:14:02,301
Don't move!

146
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:04,541
Stay where you are!

147
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:43,661
MOSCOW. AGUSTIN RAMOS.
TWO SISTERS. MAY 1. 1964 -

148
00:14:43,741 --> 00:14:45,181
He was born on Labor Day.

149
00:14:48,141 --> 00:14:51,061
On every birthday since he started
working at the mine, he said

150
00:14:52,061 --> 00:14:54,221
all the arrangements
were made for his party.

151
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:55,381
A good picket.

152
00:14:56,621 --> 00:14:58,461
And the rubber bullets were his gifts.

153
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:03,341
This year it was real bullets.

154
00:15:08,621 --> 00:15:10,581
I guess if you're born on the wrong side,

155
00:15:11,861 --> 00:15:13,141
you die on the wrong side.

156
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:17,581
What's your name?

157
00:15:18,581 --> 00:15:20,901
-No, Mónica.
-I need to know your name.

158
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:23,581
Because I'm leaving here with you.

159
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:28,381
Through the back door,
the tunnel, or holding a machine gun.

160
00:15:29,941 --> 00:15:31,621
But I don't want to be away from you.

161
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:34,501
And if I have to learn to shoot,

162
00:15:34,621 --> 00:15:35,461
I will.

163
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:38,261
Besides...

164
00:15:39,901 --> 00:15:40,901
this child...

165
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:43,701
this child is going to need a father.

166
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,181
Come on, tell me your name.

167
00:15:55,381 --> 00:15:56,581
Ricardo.

168
00:16:14,461 --> 00:16:17,421
"This is the Underground Unit,
making our way down the sewers."

169
00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:21,581
-"What's that noise?"
-"Stay still."

170
00:16:24,261 --> 00:16:26,901
"It's the metro. Line 6.
It's right above us."

171
00:16:27,341 --> 00:16:28,341
"Proceeding."

172
00:16:33,061 --> 00:16:35,261
Come on, people! Keep it up!

173
00:16:35,741 --> 00:16:39,621
Let's make sure the magic lasts
until the very end!

174
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:46,701
In there, we'll have satellite
radio and video signal

175
00:16:46,781 --> 00:16:48,981
in order to avoid frequency jammers.

176
00:16:50,021 --> 00:16:50,941
"...The bomb squad

177
00:16:51,461 --> 00:16:55,541
will open a gap in the cargo door.
300 grams of thermite explosive.

178
00:16:55,621 --> 00:16:57,301
You know what that means.

179
00:16:57,821 --> 00:16:58,941
So Lobo, Ruiz,

180
00:16:59,861 --> 00:17:02,181
you'll provide covering fire, if necessary.

181
00:17:02,581 --> 00:17:05,981
The rest of us will enter in line,
no-one stays behind."

182
00:17:06,181 --> 00:17:07,981
Come on, come on, come on!

183
00:17:08,221 --> 00:17:09,061
Gentlemen,

184
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,541
there's going to be a ruckus in there,

185
00:17:12,061 --> 00:17:13,901
"...so we'll have to be united.

186
00:17:14,221 --> 00:17:15,061
Together!"

187
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:16,941
Understood?

188
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:18,141
Yes, sir!

189
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:33,541
"The only instructions"

190
00:17:34,021 --> 00:17:36,781
are not to open fire if they wear a mask.

191
00:17:37,741 --> 00:17:41,741
"Of course, we will open fire
in response to anyone shooting at us."

192
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,421
The only instructions

193
00:17:44,941 --> 00:17:48,221
are that there's no order for any of them
to come out alive.

194
00:17:48,821 --> 00:17:49,701
Is that clear?

195
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:00,061
Is that clear?

196
00:18:00,141 --> 00:18:01,341
Yes, sir!

197
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:20,221
We're ready, so let's go get them!

198
00:18:20,301 --> 00:18:21,341
"Go, go, go!"

199
00:18:42,865 --> 00:18:45,105
Stop the machines and erase the logs.

200
00:18:45,785 --> 00:18:47,985
Remove the hard drives, we're taking them.

201
00:18:48,065 --> 00:18:50,145
We're so close
to reaching 1 billion.

202
00:18:50,225 --> 00:18:52,145
We just need to print and cut some sheets.

203
00:18:52,225 --> 00:18:53,985
How much time do we need, Mr. Torres?

204
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:55,345
-Eleven minutes.
-Eleven minutes.

205
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,305
You're rounding off the numbers, Nairobi.

206
00:18:57,385 --> 00:18:58,705
What do you think this is?

207
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:00,185
A TV game show?

208
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,465
Go pack your bags,
I'll take care of the money.

209
00:19:02,545 --> 00:19:04,145
I say I'm leaving with a billion,

210
00:19:04,225 --> 00:19:06,945
-so I'm leaving with a billion!
-I say 'stop', so you stop!

211
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:10,625
Do you know why I'm in charge?

212
00:19:11,465 --> 00:19:13,825
Because you've got shit for brains.

213
00:19:14,265 --> 00:19:18,105
You want to stay in this mousetrap
to reach the billion?

214
00:19:18,185 --> 00:19:20,305
You know
who that reminds me of?

215
00:19:22,825 --> 00:19:23,785
Of a mother

216
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,865
who leaves her child,

217
00:19:27,825 --> 00:19:30,305
a baby, to go sell pills.

218
00:19:31,985 --> 00:19:34,185
Of course, she gets caught
and loses the child.

219
00:19:34,265 --> 00:19:37,105
Under my command
those things don't happen, Nairobi!

220
00:19:41,945 --> 00:19:43,705
No, of course not.

221
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:46,905
Under your command
we plan weddings with hostages.

222
00:19:47,745 --> 00:19:50,745
Will you get married
on the beach dressed in white?

223
00:19:51,305 --> 00:19:53,225
Since you know everything,

224
00:19:53,305 --> 00:19:55,385
do you know what she feels for you?

225
00:19:58,265 --> 00:19:59,465
You make her sick!

226
00:19:59,785 --> 00:20:01,105
I heard her in the bathroom.

227
00:20:01,865 --> 00:20:03,465
The only consolation she has left

228
00:20:03,665 --> 00:20:05,385
is that she'll keep your money.

229
00:20:06,145 --> 00:20:08,505
To put up with you until you drop.

230
00:20:09,185 --> 00:20:10,625
And when you're dying,

231
00:20:10,905 --> 00:20:11,945
say to your face

232
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:13,985
how every time you raped her,

233
00:20:15,065 --> 00:20:16,545
because you are raping her,

234
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:19,305
she would go to the bathroom to throw up.

235
00:20:20,825 --> 00:20:21,985
That's all she has left.

236
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:24,985
To spit on you at your deathbed.

237
00:20:26,945 --> 00:20:28,705
That's what you have turned her into.

238
00:20:32,345 --> 00:20:33,265
Torres,

239
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:35,785
shut down the machines.

240
00:20:37,385 --> 00:20:38,425
Miss Nairobi?

241
00:20:43,505 --> 00:20:45,265
Shut down the machines, Torres.

242
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:46,305
Alright.

243
00:20:59,521 --> 00:21:00,401
Rio,

244
00:21:00,921 --> 00:21:02,641
-Rio, are you there?
-"Yes, Professor."

245
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:05,921
I encrypted the frequency.
-How long will it take to decode it?

246
00:21:06,001 --> 00:21:06,841
"Two hours."

247
00:21:08,321 --> 00:21:09,281
Perfect.

248
00:21:09,361 --> 00:21:10,881
Set the explosive charges.

249
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:12,441
Pass the intercom to Berlin.

250
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,401
"Right away."

251
00:21:14,601 --> 00:21:15,481
Hey.

252
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,001
Come, please.

253
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:27,841
What's the matter?

254
00:21:27,921 --> 00:21:29,081
I don't feel well.

255
00:21:30,481 --> 00:21:31,321
What's wrong?

256
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:33,881
I feel pain in my chest.

257
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:36,561
Maybe an anxiety attack.
Do you want a tranquiliser?

258
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,961
It would have been easier for me too
if none of this had happened.

259
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:24,721
It was the only

260
00:22:25,801 --> 00:22:28,081
actual weak point
in an otherwise perfect plan.

261
00:22:28,161 --> 00:22:30,941
A plan that's no longer perfect.
You know why?

262
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,881
Because even if this all goes well...

263
00:22:37,721 --> 00:22:39,641
Even if it all goes well, I'll be...

264
00:22:40,801 --> 00:22:42,001
I'll be fucked.

265
00:22:45,321 --> 00:22:47,081
Because I won't ever see you again.

266
00:22:49,321 --> 00:22:51,641
You think it was in my plans
to fall in love

267
00:22:51,721 --> 00:22:53,081
with the inspector?

268
00:22:53,161 --> 00:22:54,401
I don't want to hear any more.

269
00:22:58,681 --> 00:22:59,801
You don't want to hear?

270
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:04,081
Why don't you want to hear, Raquel?

271
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:08,921
Because I'm a bad guy?

272
00:23:12,321 --> 00:23:15,001
You've been taught
to see good and bad guys.

273
00:23:15,921 --> 00:23:19,641
But what we're doing
is okay to you when other people do it.

274
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:24,201
In the year 2011.
the European Central Bank made 171

275
00:23:25,801 --> 00:23:27,401
billion euros out of nowhere.

276
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:31,081
Just like we're doing.

277
00:23:32,521 --> 00:23:33,801
Only bigger.

278
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:37,521
185 billion in 2012.

279
00:23:37,601 --> 00:23:40,641
145 billion euros in the 2013.

280
00:23:40,761 --> 00:23:42,881
Do you know where all that money went?

281
00:23:46,201 --> 00:23:47,241
To the banks.

282
00:23:47,921 --> 00:23:49,441
Directly from the building

283
00:23:50,921 --> 00:23:52,321
to the pockets of the rich.

284
00:23:55,081 --> 00:23:56,281
Did anyone call

285
00:23:57,641 --> 00:23:59,721
the European Central Bank a thief?

286
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:03,321
No.

287
00:24:04,441 --> 00:24:05,801
"Liquidity injections",

288
00:24:05,881 --> 00:24:06,921
they called it.

289
00:24:07,921 --> 00:24:09,881
And they pulled it out of nowhere, Raquel.

290
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:10,961
Out of nowhere.

291
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:21,121
What's this?

292
00:24:21,601 --> 00:24:23,681
This is nothing, Raquel. Paper.

293
00:24:25,241 --> 00:24:26,681
It's paper, you see?

294
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:29,561
It's paper.

295
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:35,041
I'm making a liquidity injection,

296
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:38,081
but not for the banks.

297
00:24:38,721 --> 00:24:39,801
I'm doing it here,

298
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:41,761
in the real economy.

299
00:24:42,121 --> 00:24:43,361
With this group of...

300
00:24:43,921 --> 00:24:46,081
of losers, which is what we are, Raquel.

301
00:24:50,641 --> 00:24:52,041
To get away from it all.

302
00:24:55,921 --> 00:24:57,401
Don't you want to get away?

303
00:25:09,901 --> 00:25:11,501
Ángel is calling you.

304
00:25:11,981 --> 00:25:13,981
Does this mean he woke up?

305
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:17,821
If he's awake, they're going to...

306
00:25:17,901 --> 00:25:20,261
He'll talk and they will be here
in five minutes.

307
00:25:21,581 --> 00:25:22,421
Okay,

308
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:23,741
I'm going to answer it.

309
00:25:24,181 --> 00:25:27,181
And you'll speak.
But no nonsense, please.

310
00:25:27,261 --> 00:25:28,141
Please.

311
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:29,781
You'll answer it

312
00:25:30,461 --> 00:25:31,901
and you're going to verify

313
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:33,901
if he's awake, okay?

314
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:36,381
Please.

315
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:38,501
Please.

316
00:25:39,261 --> 00:25:41,261
No, no! Don't answer it.

317
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:43,701
Don't answer it.

318
00:25:45,741 --> 00:25:46,941
My phone is tapped.

319
00:25:51,421 --> 00:25:52,901
Do you have another one?

320
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:03,081
PRIVATE NUMBER

321
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:07,061
Who's speaking?

322
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:08,301
"Raquel."

323
00:26:08,381 --> 00:26:09,421
Raquel Murillo.

324
00:26:10,981 --> 00:26:12,061
"Ángel woke up.

325
00:26:12,741 --> 00:26:15,421
He didn't want us to call anyone
before he talked to you."

326
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:16,741
I'll put him on.

327
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:23,261
"Raquel..."

328
00:26:29,141 --> 00:26:30,021
...how are you?

329
00:26:36,021 --> 00:26:36,901
"Don't worry,

330
00:26:37,261 --> 00:26:38,301
come on."

331
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:41,341
Take it easy.

332
00:26:42,741 --> 00:26:43,741
Come on, Raquel.

333
00:26:44,901 --> 00:26:46,541
-How are you?
-"Me?"

334
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:49,981
So high I can't even feel my arse.

335
00:26:56,341 --> 00:26:57,461
"Listen,"

336
00:26:58,621 --> 00:27:00,461
I saw on the TV that you've...

337
00:27:01,181 --> 00:27:03,381
you've been replaced in the investigation.

338
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:05,381
Yes.

339
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,701
Don't tell anyone I woke up, okay?

340
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:13,741
I need you to come see me first.

341
00:27:16,021 --> 00:27:17,021
Okay.

342
00:27:23,301 --> 00:27:26,221
Colonel, we've picked up a phone call
to Murillo's number.

343
00:27:26,621 --> 00:27:28,301
But there was no communication.

344
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:30,381
Locate the call immediately.

345
00:27:30,461 --> 00:27:32,181
Get the owner and the antenna.

346
00:27:32,261 --> 00:27:33,141
Now.

347
00:27:35,301 --> 00:27:37,101
You have to let me go talk to Ángel.

348
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:42,821
If I don't go, in 15 minutes
he'll tell the police where you are.

349
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:44,741
And I can stop him.

350
00:27:45,341 --> 00:27:47,101
-It's your only chance...
-Please.

351
00:27:47,181 --> 00:27:50,141
It's about your perfect plan
not falling apart.

352
00:27:50,221 --> 00:27:51,741
Please, let me think.

353
00:27:51,821 --> 00:27:53,341
There's nothing to think about.

354
00:27:53,581 --> 00:27:54,461
Sergio.

355
00:28:11,821 --> 00:28:12,741
I'm with you.

356
00:28:14,261 --> 00:28:17,221
A minute ago you were screaming
and biting me like an animal.

357
00:28:21,461 --> 00:28:22,501
Can I trust you?

358
00:28:23,221 --> 00:28:24,061
Come.

359
00:28:24,821 --> 00:28:25,701
Come closer.

360
00:29:38,261 --> 00:29:39,181
Colonel,

361
00:29:40,621 --> 00:29:42,461
We have the phone call made to Raquel.

362
00:29:43,821 --> 00:29:45,421
It was made from Ángel's phone.

363
00:29:46,141 --> 00:29:48,101
-What?
-Deputy Inspector Rubio.

364
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:58,261
Call the hospital and find out
if he woke up.

365
00:29:58,541 --> 00:30:00,821
If so, send 3 men, quickly.

366
00:30:01,461 --> 00:30:03,781
That bitch could show up there any minute.

367
00:30:10,361 --> 00:30:11,281
Done.

368
00:30:11,721 --> 00:30:13,361
Timers and cells set.

369
00:30:14,401 --> 00:30:16,361
This will keep the police
busy for a while.

370
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:18,781
They'll have to deactivate them
one by one.

371
00:30:21,721 --> 00:30:23,321
What's your plan tomorrow?

372
00:30:26,081 --> 00:30:26,961
Tomorrow?

373
00:30:28,521 --> 00:30:31,801
Tomorrow I'm going to be sailing
on a cargo ship.

374
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:34,001
Sunbathing with my titties out.

375
00:30:35,161 --> 00:30:36,521
With your titties out?

376
00:30:38,521 --> 00:30:39,561
To avoid tan lines.

377
00:30:41,361 --> 00:30:43,481
So you'll be there with your titties out

378
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:45,201
with all those lonely sailors

379
00:30:45,841 --> 00:30:47,761
who haven't seen a woman in three months?

380
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:52,441
You think I can't defend myself?

381
00:30:53,841 --> 00:30:56,281
Or do you want
to defend me from the peeping Toms?

382
00:30:56,441 --> 00:30:57,401
It's not that.

383
00:30:58,721 --> 00:31:00,441
That journey will be our last one.

384
00:31:01,721 --> 00:31:04,521
And I don't know what
you're going to do at the end.

385
00:31:04,961 --> 00:31:07,961
I don't know if you'll take off
on a jet ski with guns blazing

386
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:09,601
or what you're going to do.

387
00:31:10,521 --> 00:31:12,041
So I want you to stay put.

388
00:31:12,761 --> 00:31:13,681
With me.

389
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:15,361
In my cabin.

390
00:31:17,121 --> 00:31:18,001
Hey.

391
00:31:19,441 --> 00:31:21,201
We just hit a brick wall.

392
00:31:23,521 --> 00:31:24,401
Hold this.

393
00:31:36,241 --> 00:31:37,681
Make an opening in that wall.

394
00:31:37,761 --> 00:31:38,961
It leads to the sewer.

395
00:31:39,321 --> 00:31:41,361
That's where we'll exit through.

396
00:31:41,561 --> 00:31:42,441
Move.

397
00:31:45,841 --> 00:31:46,761
Here.

398
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:49,481
Did you see all those bombs?

399
00:31:51,481 --> 00:31:52,361
Fuck.

400
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:56,641
20 years of my life.

401
00:31:57,641 --> 00:31:58,601
20 years.

402
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:03,881
Jesus,

403
00:32:04,081 --> 00:32:05,281
give me the sledgehammer.

404
00:32:08,081 --> 00:32:11,241
"We're 200 metres from the outlet.
Estimated time, 6 minutes.

405
00:32:11,601 --> 00:32:12,481
Let's go."

406
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:16,081
"Copy that.
We'll report any seismic movement."

407
00:32:27,601 --> 00:32:28,481
Berlin,

408
00:32:29,201 --> 00:32:30,401
stop the chain right now.

409
00:32:30,801 --> 00:32:32,321
Nairobi, we're leaving.

410
00:32:32,401 --> 00:32:35,641
-There's still money left to pack.
-We've got excess baggage. People,

411
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:37,641
it's been a pleasure robbing you,

412
00:32:38,161 --> 00:32:41,241
but it's time to enjoy
a well-deserved vacation.

413
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:46,281
-"Doctor Sanchez requested in room seven."

414
00:33:11,841 --> 00:33:12,761
Raquel.

415
00:33:18,761 --> 00:33:20,961
-How are you doing?
-Well, here I am.

416
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:23,961
I'm glad you pulled through.

417
00:33:25,841 --> 00:33:27,481
I think I owe you an apology.

418
00:33:27,681 --> 00:33:29,001
You don't need to apologise.

419
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:33,721
Although you did call me a schmuck
and a clown.

420
00:33:33,841 --> 00:33:37,001
It's the most humiliating thing
I've been called in my damn life.

421
00:33:37,721 --> 00:33:40,561
I haven't been able
to rest peacefully in the coma.

422
00:33:42,681 --> 00:33:43,681
I'm really sorry.

423
00:33:47,321 --> 00:33:49,481
Why did they discharge you from the case?

424
00:33:52,561 --> 00:33:55,001
Because they think I'm with the robbers.

425
00:33:56,841 --> 00:33:57,881
And are you?

426
00:33:59,121 --> 00:33:59,961
No.

427
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:02,361
But you had a relationship
with that guy.

428
00:34:04,881 --> 00:34:05,721
Yes.

429
00:34:06,201 --> 00:34:07,601
And are you in love with him?

430
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:23,961
I'll give you the hangar's location.

431
00:34:25,281 --> 00:34:27,681
It's where he controls the operation from.

432
00:34:30,521 --> 00:34:32,521
In case you want to clear your reputation,

433
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:34,201
solve the case and beat them.

434
00:34:40,241 --> 00:34:41,561
I know where the hangar is.

435
00:34:43,241 --> 00:34:44,921
But I won't tell them.

436
00:34:48,281 --> 00:34:49,241
Why not?

437
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:51,281
Because I don't know who the good guys

438
00:34:51,361 --> 00:34:52,921
or bad guys are anymore.

439
00:34:55,521 --> 00:34:57,201
-Don't move!
-Hands up!

440
00:35:07,681 --> 00:35:08,921
Put your hands up.

441
00:35:11,521 --> 00:35:12,641
López.

442
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:16,561
Arenas.

443
00:35:20,321 --> 00:35:21,201
Gómez.

444
00:35:31,401 --> 00:35:32,441
Ángel...

445
00:36:04,181 --> 00:36:06,301
There will be laws on our island,
you know?

446
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:07,741
We'll have to be nudist.

447
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:09,461
Except me, I can wear a loincloth.

448
00:36:11,101 --> 00:36:13,341
Go set explosives in the warehouse,
will you?

449
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:36,661
Tokyo!

450
00:36:54,581 --> 00:36:55,821
Move!

451
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,461
"Move!"

452
00:36:59,421 --> 00:37:00,301
My gun!

453
00:37:00,421 --> 00:37:01,901
Take this one, damn it!

454
00:37:22,061 --> 00:37:23,381
What the fuck do we do?

455
00:37:30,621 --> 00:37:31,861
Fucking riot shields!

456
00:37:32,861 --> 00:37:34,341
We must shoot at their feet!

457
00:37:39,501 --> 00:37:40,381
Cover me!

458
00:37:46,741 --> 00:37:48,381
Sons of bitches!

459
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:50,541
Lobo, damage report!

460
00:37:51,781 --> 00:37:53,661
They've hit several agents, sir!

461
00:37:53,741 --> 00:37:55,021
I'll cover you!

462
00:38:00,421 --> 00:38:01,821
Evacuate the wounded!

463
00:38:01,901 --> 00:38:03,421
Evacuate the wounded and go on!

464
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,781
If we get out
I'll put down my weapon.

465
00:38:07,861 --> 00:38:08,701
I swear.

466
00:38:08,781 --> 00:38:09,861
You mean it?

467
00:38:09,941 --> 00:38:11,701
Not even an air rifle at the fair.

468
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,301
"Come on, get them!"

469
00:38:23,221 --> 00:38:24,461
Besides,

470
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:26,581
we have to get things for our island,
right?

471
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:29,501
Curtains,

472
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:30,781
couches...

473
00:38:30,901 --> 00:38:31,741
Our island?

474
00:38:33,621 --> 00:38:35,021
Sons of bitches!

475
00:38:36,861 --> 00:38:39,141
Go, go, go, give them hell!

476
00:38:41,301 --> 00:38:42,941
-Fuck!
-Lobo, now!

477
00:38:44,341 --> 00:38:46,381
They're coming! Let's go!

478
00:38:46,461 --> 00:38:47,901
-Fuck!
-Let's go!

479
00:38:49,021 --> 00:38:49,981
Let's go!

480
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:51,181
Go!

481
00:38:53,981 --> 00:38:55,181
Go, go, go.

482
00:38:55,901 --> 00:38:57,061
Fuck!

483
00:38:57,141 --> 00:38:58,541
-Move!
-Let's go.

484
00:39:00,141 --> 00:39:02,421
-Hold your ground.
-We have to reach that door!

485
00:39:04,621 --> 00:39:06,341
Hold your fire! Don't shoot!

486
00:39:06,421 --> 00:39:07,501
-Anibal.
-What?

487
00:39:09,901 --> 00:39:10,861
Give me your badge.

488
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:12,741
The engagement badge?

489
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:15,061
Now!

490
00:39:17,101 --> 00:39:18,101
Hold your ground!

491
00:39:24,501 --> 00:39:25,621
Hold your ground!

492
00:39:28,221 --> 00:39:29,381
-I love you!
-I love you!

493
00:39:33,541 --> 00:39:34,381
Here I go!

494
00:39:34,701 --> 00:39:35,541
Now!

495
00:39:40,261 --> 00:39:41,261
Tokyo!

496
00:39:44,821 --> 00:39:45,901
Tokyo!

497
00:39:48,061 --> 00:39:48,901
Tokyo!

498
00:39:51,421 --> 00:39:53,021
-Tokyo.
-You're under arrest!

499
00:39:53,381 --> 00:39:54,221
Don't move!

500
00:39:55,381 --> 00:39:56,421
-Rio!
-Don't move!

501
00:39:56,901 --> 00:39:58,461
-Rio.
-No, don't shoot!

502
00:39:58,541 --> 00:39:59,701
Move away from her!

503
00:39:59,941 --> 00:40:01,461
-Hands up!
-Rio, get down!

504
00:40:09,861 --> 00:40:10,821
Shit!

505
00:40:11,861 --> 00:40:12,781
Shit!

506
00:40:35,621 --> 00:40:36,661
Run, run!

507
00:40:37,221 --> 00:40:38,701
Lobo, Ruiz! Are you holding up?

508
00:40:39,381 --> 00:40:40,421
Ruiz, fuck!

509
00:40:41,061 --> 00:40:42,061
Evacuate Ruiz!

510
00:40:43,261 --> 00:40:44,301
Rio!

511
00:40:44,941 --> 00:40:45,861
-Denver!
-What?

512
00:40:45,941 --> 00:40:48,061
Go get the Browning.
Meet us in the vault!

513
00:40:48,141 --> 00:40:48,981
Okay.

514
00:40:49,461 --> 00:40:50,861
-Go!
-Let's move!

515
00:40:53,061 --> 00:40:54,261
We're under attack!

516
00:40:55,101 --> 00:40:58,021
Get in formation and move!
Let's get them!

517
00:41:01,341 --> 00:41:02,221
Yes, sir.

518
00:41:04,341 --> 00:41:05,381
I'll put him on.

519
00:41:08,221 --> 00:41:09,701
The CNI has taken over.

520
00:41:10,181 --> 00:41:11,381
It's Colonel Prieto.

521
00:41:12,701 --> 00:41:13,741
Ángel, how are you?

522
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:17,501
Well, I've seen better days, to be honest.

523
00:41:17,861 --> 00:41:19,421
"Hey, I'm curious,"

524
00:41:19,621 --> 00:41:22,461
why did you call Inspector Murillo first?

525
00:41:23,421 --> 00:41:24,781
Because we're friends.

526
00:41:26,501 --> 00:41:27,581
Don't screw with me.

527
00:41:27,901 --> 00:41:29,581
"Why did she come to see you?"

528
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:31,941
She came because we're friends.

529
00:41:33,501 --> 00:41:35,621
She humiliated you
in front of the team,

530
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,581
almost ended your career
and your life.

531
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,381
So drop this fucking friendship bullshit.

532
00:41:43,221 --> 00:41:45,061
"I'll repeat the question, Ángel."

533
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:48,341
Why did you call Inspector Murillo?

534
00:41:49,621 --> 00:41:51,221
Because she's my friend.

535
00:41:51,981 --> 00:41:54,461
You were at the hideout
of the Professor.

536
00:41:54,541 --> 00:41:56,501
"I know you took a teaspoon

537
00:41:56,581 --> 00:41:58,981
and turned it over
to forensics for analysis."

538
00:41:59,461 --> 00:42:00,581
Give us the address.

539
00:42:02,101 --> 00:42:03,421
I don't remember anything.

540
00:42:04,781 --> 00:42:07,221
-I don't remember a fucking thing.
-Right.

541
00:42:09,221 --> 00:42:13,621
You know that hiding information
is an offence of concealment.

542
00:42:13,941 --> 00:42:16,581
"You may end up sharing a cell
with the robbers,"

543
00:42:16,981 --> 00:42:19,141
or with your friend.

544
00:42:21,781 --> 00:42:22,941
"Give us the address."

545
00:42:26,621 --> 00:42:27,541
Prieto...

546
00:42:31,941 --> 00:42:35,581
you sure know how to treat a guy
who just came out of a coma.

547
00:42:51,221 --> 00:42:53,541
Let's go! Nobody stays behind!

548
00:42:53,741 --> 00:42:54,581
Let's go!

549
00:43:00,021 --> 00:43:01,461
Everyone put your masks on!

550
00:43:02,981 --> 00:43:05,541
-They're inside.
-Take the Browning to vault 3!

551
00:43:06,061 --> 00:43:06,981
Denver's on it.

552
00:43:07,141 --> 00:43:08,501
What about the hostages?

553
00:43:08,581 --> 00:43:10,221
-We hand them over.
-Everyone mix!

554
00:43:10,541 --> 00:43:12,541
Mix, scramble and on your knees!

555
00:43:13,141 --> 00:43:14,101
Let's go!

556
00:43:17,101 --> 00:43:18,061
Well, not everyone.

557
00:43:19,421 --> 00:43:20,981
Ariadna is coming with me.

558
00:43:22,341 --> 00:43:23,621
Let's go, Helsinki!

559
00:43:30,861 --> 00:43:32,221
They're in the museum.

560
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:39,461
Hands up where I can see them.
All of you, hands up!

561
00:43:39,541 --> 00:43:41,541
-Don't shoot.
-Don't shoot, we're hostages!

562
00:43:41,621 --> 00:43:42,821
Everyone, masks off!

563
00:43:48,021 --> 00:43:49,101
They're hostages.

564
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:51,701
They're hostages, get them out. Now!

565
00:43:52,541 --> 00:43:54,141
Prepare for rescue protocol.

566
00:43:55,221 --> 00:43:56,821
-We're freeing hostages.
- Suárez,

567
00:43:56,901 --> 00:43:58,421
we're sticking to the plan.

568
00:43:58,741 --> 00:44:00,181
Go to the basement.

569
00:44:00,421 --> 00:44:02,261
We must get them out
through the tunnel.

570
00:44:02,341 --> 00:44:05,621
You, with them. The rest with me,
to the basement. Let's go!

571
00:45:02,021 --> 00:45:03,261
We've got Parker.

572
00:45:06,101 --> 00:45:07,581
Get me the ambassador.

573
00:45:07,661 --> 00:45:10,221
Do a headcount
and check identities of the hostages.

574
00:45:11,621 --> 00:45:13,861
"Colonel, we're making
our way down the sewer."

575
00:45:18,621 --> 00:45:19,461
Move.

576
00:45:26,221 --> 00:45:27,621
What the hell is that?

577
00:45:27,821 --> 00:45:28,981
Call in the TEDAX unit.

578
00:45:29,941 --> 00:45:31,781
The basement is full of explosives.

579
00:45:31,861 --> 00:45:32,861
Motherfuckers.

580
00:45:41,501 --> 00:45:42,701
Can you defuse it?

581
00:45:45,341 --> 00:45:47,101
Yes, but I'll need time, sir.

582
00:45:48,421 --> 00:45:50,381
"The detonator could be
close to the RDX.

583
00:45:50,501 --> 00:45:51,741
There may be tripwires."

584
00:45:51,901 --> 00:45:54,341
We are detecting
movement in the tunnel, sir.

585
00:45:57,981 --> 00:45:59,301
"Closing in on the target."

586
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:16,301
-"They're on the other side of the wall."
-5 of the robbers.

587
00:46:18,061 --> 00:46:18,941
Wait.

588
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:20,981
There are 6 of them.

589
00:46:21,501 --> 00:46:22,461
It's them.

590
00:46:23,061 --> 00:46:25,581
They're about to exit the hole
into the sewer.

591
00:46:27,301 --> 00:46:28,901
Underground agents ready.

592
00:46:29,381 --> 00:46:31,261
-They're closing in on you.
-"Copy that."

593
00:46:32,021 --> 00:46:34,101
We've got you, motherfuckers.

594
00:46:34,741 --> 00:46:35,661
In 6 seconds,

595
00:46:36,541 --> 00:46:37,381
5.

596
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:38,341
4.

597
00:46:39,341 --> 00:46:40,341
3.

598
00:46:41,021 --> 00:46:41,861
2.

599
00:46:42,541 --> 00:46:43,381
1.

600
00:46:44,261 --> 00:46:45,101
"Don't move.

601
00:46:45,581 --> 00:46:46,701
Hold your ground."

602
00:46:48,181 --> 00:46:49,101
Hold it.

603
00:46:52,901 --> 00:46:53,901
Hands up!

604
00:46:53,981 --> 00:46:55,061
-Get down!
-Don't shoot!

605
00:46:55,621 --> 00:46:57,301
-Don't shoot!
-Turn off the light!

606
00:46:59,101 --> 00:47:00,181
"Don't shoot!

607
00:47:00,421 --> 00:47:01,501
I'm Arturo Roman!"

608
00:47:02,261 --> 00:47:03,861
"They're hostages, hold your fire!"

609
00:47:04,941 --> 00:47:06,621
"Confirmed, they are hostages."

610
00:47:07,341 --> 00:47:08,221
No!

611
00:47:10,741 --> 00:47:13,301
I may not have always
been able to read women.

612
00:47:13,421 --> 00:47:15,821
Maybe because of my ego.
But with you it's different.

613
00:47:15,981 --> 00:47:17,581
I know exactly what you feel.

614
00:47:17,661 --> 00:47:19,461
I know that even without money,

615
00:47:19,541 --> 00:47:22,741
you'd come with me anywhere
because you're madly in love.

616
00:47:22,821 --> 00:47:24,581
-Isn't that right?
-Yes, of course.

617
00:47:25,021 --> 00:47:27,581
That's why I want you to know
that I love you too.

618
00:47:28,421 --> 00:47:29,661
Berlin, hurry!

619
00:47:29,781 --> 00:47:31,341
And the little time we have left

620
00:47:31,901 --> 00:47:34,541
is going to be like fireworks.

621
00:47:52,141 --> 00:47:53,541
A wonderful toy.

622
00:47:55,741 --> 00:47:57,821
Wonderful toy, Helsinki!

623
00:47:58,021 --> 00:47:59,261
Nairobi, how's that going?

624
00:47:59,341 --> 00:48:02,181
The trench is in place,
just the last batch of money left.

625
00:48:02,261 --> 00:48:03,141
Helsinki!

626
00:48:03,701 --> 00:48:04,541
Let's go!

627
00:48:05,141 --> 00:48:06,141
Let's go, hurry.

628
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:08,421
Colonel,

629
00:48:09,021 --> 00:48:10,421
they have another tunnel.

630
00:48:13,421 --> 00:48:14,301
What?

631
00:48:14,421 --> 00:48:16,581
They're taking the money to the vault.

632
00:48:17,021 --> 00:48:17,941
We saw them.

633
00:48:18,221 --> 00:48:21,221
They made a hole in the ground
and they'll take it out through there.

634
00:48:21,341 --> 00:48:22,341
Come here.

635
00:48:25,621 --> 00:48:28,781
There are four vaults,
two on each side of the corridor.

636
00:48:28,901 --> 00:48:31,941
Can you tell me which one it is,
or point it out on the map?

637
00:48:36,101 --> 00:48:37,541
Vault number 3.

638
00:48:39,101 --> 00:48:40,461
Are you sure, Alison?

639
00:48:43,861 --> 00:48:44,741
Yes.

640
00:48:45,021 --> 00:48:45,901
Suárez.

641
00:48:46,061 --> 00:48:46,941
Do you copy?

642
00:48:47,021 --> 00:48:48,581
-"Copy, sir."
-Change of plans.

643
00:48:48,661 --> 00:48:50,581
Vault 3. Top priority.

644
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:52,981
"Repeat, top priority.
That's where their tunnel is."

645
00:48:53,061 --> 00:48:54,181
Roger that, Colonel.

646
00:48:54,461 --> 00:48:56,661
To vault 3! Go, go, go!

647
00:48:57,141 --> 00:48:59,101
Do you know
where that tunnel leads?

648
00:48:59,181 --> 00:49:00,541
They don't know, but I do.

649
00:49:01,861 --> 00:49:05,181
To the hangar
where the fucking Professor works.

650
00:49:06,021 --> 00:49:07,381
That's their escape route.

651
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:12,141
Bring in Inspector Murillo, now!

652
00:49:14,381 --> 00:49:17,661
Gómez, get Inspector Murillo here,
immediately!

653
00:49:22,941 --> 00:49:24,981
Will you get your son
when you get out?

654
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:25,941
No.

655
00:49:26,541 --> 00:49:27,541
Not for now.

656
00:49:29,301 --> 00:49:30,381
I'm without a plan.

657
00:49:34,621 --> 00:49:35,861
We can share a flat.

658
00:49:37,221 --> 00:49:38,061
Helsinki.

659
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:42,421
Let's get out of here. Now!

660
00:49:42,501 --> 00:49:45,021
-They're in the basement.
-Let's go!

661
00:49:45,101 --> 00:49:45,981
Get out now.

662
00:49:46,061 --> 00:49:48,701
-What about Denver?
-On his way to the hangar. Get out!

663
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:51,821
That's an order.

664
00:50:02,821 --> 00:50:03,741
Berlin!

665
00:50:04,061 --> 00:50:04,941
Let's go!

666
00:50:20,861 --> 00:50:23,341
They're coming down the stairs.
They're almost there.

667
00:50:23,421 --> 00:50:24,701
Okay, copy that.

668
00:50:24,901 --> 00:50:26,101
They know where we are.

669
00:50:26,181 --> 00:50:27,221
Get out of here.

670
00:50:27,501 --> 00:50:30,261
-It's now or never.
-Helsinki, take Nairobi.

671
00:50:30,341 --> 00:50:32,581
-I'll hold the fort.
-What do you mean?

672
00:50:32,661 --> 00:50:33,581
I said go!

673
00:50:33,661 --> 00:50:35,621
If they enter the tunnel, we're all dead!

674
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:40,701
What are you doing?

675
00:50:40,781 --> 00:50:42,941
Someone has to stay in the trench.

676
00:50:43,021 --> 00:50:45,461
-No.
-Yes, they're hot on our heels!

677
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:48,301
-Well, we're all leaving together!
-Nairobi,

678
00:50:51,341 --> 00:50:53,181
You said I was sexist, right?

679
00:50:56,661 --> 00:50:58,461
Well then, women and queers first.

680
00:50:58,941 --> 00:51:00,181
-Let's go.
-I hate you!

681
00:51:00,261 --> 00:51:01,181
Come on!

682
00:51:02,341 --> 00:51:03,741
-I hate you!
-Come on!

683
00:51:06,821 --> 00:51:09,301
Come on.
Everyone at their stations.

684
00:51:13,341 --> 00:51:14,261
Wait!

685
00:51:16,941 --> 00:51:17,821
Hey.

686
00:51:19,021 --> 00:51:20,341
Where are you going, honey?

687
00:51:21,781 --> 00:51:24,661
We had agreed that we
would stay together to the end.

688
00:51:24,741 --> 00:51:25,581
No!

689
00:51:26,621 --> 00:51:27,621
Berlin, please.

690
00:51:30,101 --> 00:51:32,021
No! Let me out!

691
00:51:32,101 --> 00:51:33,861
Let me out, damn it!

692
00:51:34,541 --> 00:51:36,421
-Stay still!
-Fuck you, bastard!

693
00:51:36,701 --> 00:51:37,661
Bastard!

694
00:51:37,741 --> 00:51:38,901
You son of a bitch!

695
00:51:43,221 --> 00:51:44,981
You and I are the resistance.

696
00:52:04,301 --> 00:52:05,661
You're a sorry sight.

697
00:52:09,741 --> 00:52:11,061
Where's the hangar?

698
00:52:14,941 --> 00:52:15,821
I don't know.

699
00:52:17,181 --> 00:52:18,501
Not only do you know,

700
00:52:18,581 --> 00:52:20,661
but you know
that I know you know,

701
00:52:20,741 --> 00:52:22,461
so let's spare ourselves this part.

702
00:52:45,581 --> 00:52:47,101
Heavy fire, take cover!

703
00:52:55,141 --> 00:52:56,061
We must go back.

704
00:52:56,221 --> 00:52:57,541
No, Nairobi. No.

705
00:52:57,821 --> 00:52:59,661
There's no time. Let's go.

706
00:53:01,301 --> 00:53:02,461
Ariadna, load it!

707
00:53:02,941 --> 00:53:03,861
Load it!

708
00:53:03,941 --> 00:53:04,901
Now!

709
00:53:08,981 --> 00:53:10,341
Load it, come on!

710
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,901
This is a lawsuit for legal custody.

711
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,661
And it was presented
by the hero of the case,

712
00:53:30,781 --> 00:53:34,021
the officer who identified
the leader of the operation.

713
00:53:34,941 --> 00:53:35,821
Your ex-husband.

714
00:53:38,701 --> 00:53:40,421
Hang in there!

715
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:44,901
-Load!
-Now!

716
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:50,581
We're Romeo and Juliet!

717
00:53:50,861 --> 00:53:52,221
We're Bonnie and Clyde!

718
00:53:52,501 --> 00:53:53,381
We're

719
00:53:53,741 --> 00:53:55,101
the Lovers of Teruel!

720
00:53:59,061 --> 00:54:01,101
He requests full custody
of your daughter.

721
00:54:01,181 --> 00:54:06,021
And if a judge finds you guilty
of the charges held against you,

722
00:54:06,941 --> 00:54:08,861
it will automatically be granted.

723
00:54:09,141 --> 00:54:12,501
And if he is indeed
the abuser you say he is,

724
00:54:12,941 --> 00:54:14,621
your daughter will be in trouble.

725
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:21,221
Load!

726
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:22,221
Now!

727
00:54:27,141 --> 00:54:29,221
You son of a bitch, motherfucker,

728
00:54:29,741 --> 00:54:30,861
fucking bastard.

729
00:54:32,021 --> 00:54:34,461
Intelligence can drop all charges.

730
00:54:35,381 --> 00:54:39,301
I'm Intelligence. But don't ask
for more guarantees than my word

731
00:54:39,421 --> 00:54:42,941
because the offer disappears
if the kidnappers get away.

732
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:46,701
And that could happen in a few minutes.

733
00:54:47,181 --> 00:54:48,061
Let's go.

734
00:54:56,621 --> 00:54:57,541
So choose,

735
00:54:58,261 --> 00:54:59,141
your daughter

736
00:54:59,861 --> 00:55:02,301
or a guy you didn't know just last week.

737
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:10,781
Lobo, we can't contain that machine gun!

738
00:55:10,941 --> 00:55:12,341
We have to take it out!

739
00:55:13,661 --> 00:55:14,981
Hand grenade!

740
00:55:18,701 --> 00:55:19,581
Load!

741
00:55:19,661 --> 00:55:20,501
Now!

742
00:55:21,741 --> 00:55:22,701
Take cover!

743
00:55:25,461 --> 00:55:26,381
Look out, let's go!

744
00:55:27,101 --> 00:55:29,981
Come on, take cover! Go!

745
00:55:31,301 --> 00:55:32,181
Take cover!

746
00:55:43,181 --> 00:55:44,101
You're here.

747
00:55:44,421 --> 00:55:45,581
You're finally here.

748
00:55:46,941 --> 00:55:47,901
Where's Berlin?

749
00:55:48,141 --> 00:55:49,181
He stayed inside.

750
00:55:53,181 --> 00:55:55,701
-What do you mean?
-The GEO's were on us

751
00:55:56,021 --> 00:55:58,101
and he was determined to cover the tunnel.

752
00:56:00,021 --> 00:56:01,141
He saved our lives.

753
00:56:06,661 --> 00:56:07,701
Clear. Formation!

754
00:56:30,301 --> 00:56:31,581
Surprise!

755
00:56:34,941 --> 00:56:36,101
It's him, get down!

756
00:56:49,741 --> 00:56:51,301
You don't have much time left.

757
00:56:52,021 --> 00:56:54,101
Not only will you lose your daughter,

758
00:56:54,181 --> 00:56:55,981
you'll be throwing your life away.

759
00:56:56,301 --> 00:56:57,261
Give me that address.

760
00:57:00,941 --> 00:57:02,261
Give me that address!

761
00:57:05,141 --> 00:57:06,581
Alcántara, 33.

762
00:57:10,581 --> 00:57:12,981
Alcántara, 33! Everyone over there!

763
00:57:24,301 --> 00:57:25,261
Andrés!

764
00:57:28,821 --> 00:57:29,661
Andrés!

765
00:57:30,141 --> 00:57:31,061
Professor?

766
00:57:31,501 --> 00:57:32,381
Fire!

767
00:57:34,221 --> 00:57:36,061
I'm a little busy now!

768
00:57:40,861 --> 00:57:41,701
Enter the tunnel.

769
00:57:44,221 --> 00:57:45,221
Negative!

770
00:57:47,461 --> 00:57:48,501
Andrés,

771
00:57:49,141 --> 00:57:51,461
we're going to blow the tunnel.
Get out.

772
00:57:52,341 --> 00:57:53,941
They're closing in, it's too late.

773
00:57:54,021 --> 00:57:54,941
Move forward!

774
00:57:56,221 --> 00:57:57,421
Leave now!

775
00:58:00,301 --> 00:58:02,381
I'm not leaving without you,
you know that.

776
00:58:02,821 --> 00:58:03,821
Clip!

777
00:58:04,301 --> 00:58:05,221
Move forward!

778
00:58:08,821 --> 00:58:10,141
Old age isn't for me.

779
00:58:13,821 --> 00:58:17,221
Imagine me drooling
or losing sphincter control?

780
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:19,221
No.

781
00:58:19,581 --> 00:58:21,581
That takes courage. I prefer this.

782
00:58:25,421 --> 00:58:26,541
Get out, please.

783
00:58:26,741 --> 00:58:27,581
Sergio!

784
00:58:28,061 --> 00:58:29,021
"Don't give me that."

785
00:58:29,261 --> 00:58:32,701
You promised to not stick around
if things got ugly, and they did.

786
00:58:34,661 --> 00:58:35,621
Helsinki,

787
00:58:37,101 --> 00:58:38,141
blow the tunnel.

788
00:58:39,661 --> 00:58:40,821
No, no.

789
00:58:44,501 --> 00:58:45,341
Get down!

790
00:58:46,101 --> 00:58:48,581
Helsinki, it's an order.
Soldier, blow it!

791
00:58:49,181 --> 00:58:50,621
No. Don't do it!

792
00:58:51,101 --> 00:58:53,781
Helsinki, it's an order.
Soldier, blow the tunnel!

793
00:58:54,461 --> 00:58:56,301
-Professor...
-No, Helsinki!

794
00:58:56,661 --> 00:58:59,261
I love you, little brother.
Don't forget it.

795
00:58:59,341 --> 00:59:00,781
-Professor!

796
00:59:03,861 --> 00:59:04,781
Helsinki!

797
00:59:04,861 --> 00:59:05,701
Andrés!

798
00:59:10,581 --> 00:59:12,061
Andrés, please!

799
00:59:12,141 --> 00:59:15,021
I've spent my life being
a bit of an arsehole, but today...

800
00:59:18,861 --> 00:59:20,701
I think I feel like dying with dignity.

801
00:59:22,821 --> 00:59:24,021
No!

802
00:59:28,741 --> 00:59:29,901
Let's go, give him hell!

803
00:59:43,661 --> 00:59:44,541
Professor.

804
00:59:59,861 --> 01:00:00,741
Clear!

805
01:00:15,181 --> 01:00:16,261
Fonollosa is down.

806
01:00:16,741 --> 01:00:18,421
I repeat, Fonollosa is down.

807
01:00:39,221 --> 01:00:40,101
Professor,

808
01:00:41,061 --> 01:00:42,061
listen.

809
01:00:44,381 --> 01:00:45,541
We must keep going.

810
01:00:47,221 --> 01:00:48,261
We must keep going.

811
01:00:51,021 --> 01:00:52,101
We must keep going.

812
01:00:56,701 --> 01:00:58,661
"Colonel, units heading to Alcántara, 33.

813
01:00:58,941 --> 01:01:00,581
300 metres from the target."

814
01:01:07,421 --> 01:01:08,581
Change your clothes.

815
01:01:22,621 --> 01:01:24,181
"Turning onto Alcántara street.

816
01:01:24,261 --> 01:01:25,781
We've reached the target."

817
01:01:47,261 --> 01:01:48,501
"We're inside the hangar."

818
01:01:49,261 --> 01:01:52,181
"Search the area.
Velero and Sanz to the left. Rivero, with me."

819
01:01:54,701 --> 01:01:55,541
"Velero?"

820
01:01:55,661 --> 01:01:56,581
"It's clear."

821
01:01:59,741 --> 01:02:01,381
-"Sanz?"
-"It's clear."

822
01:02:04,541 --> 01:02:06,581
-"Ribero?"
-"Clear!"

823
01:02:15,021 --> 01:02:16,061
"Confirmed, Colonel.

824
01:02:17,021 --> 01:02:18,261
There's no-one here.

825
01:02:19,381 --> 01:02:20,581
The hangar is empty."

826
01:02:46,181 --> 01:02:48,101
WEDNESDAY 6:28 PM

827
01:02:52,461 --> 01:02:54,381

"It's been one year since the heist
at the Royal Mint.

837
01:04:59,501 --> 01:05:02,101
Considered the greatest robbery
of all time,

838
01:05:02,381 --> 01:05:03,741
it remains unsolved."

839
01:05:03,821 --> 01:05:06,741
"The whereabouts of the robbers,
who got away with

840
01:05:07,021 --> 01:05:10,181
over 1 billion euros,
remain unknown.

841
01:05:10,461 --> 01:05:13,621
Although the authorities
condemned the heist,

842
01:05:13,901 --> 01:05:17,701
the public regard
their actions as a legitimate

843
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:20,941
protest against
the established order,

844
01:05:21,461 --> 01:05:23,861
and has generated popular
discussion on social media."

845
01:05:24,021 --> 01:05:25,501
"The most well-known case

846
01:05:25,581 --> 01:05:27,621
was that of former Chief Police Inspector

847
01:05:27,701 --> 01:05:31,461
Raquel Murillo, who left the force after
controversial statements to the media,

848
01:05:32,101 --> 01:05:33,701
in which she disapproved

849
01:05:33,781 --> 01:05:37,381
of the way National Intelligence
handled the crisis."

850
01:05:40,221 --> 01:05:41,061
"Let's leave.

851
01:05:42,061 --> 01:05:44,261
Let's take off to some country
in the Caribbean."

852
01:05:44,341 --> 01:05:45,261
"It's just that,

853
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:46,781
it's so crazy that...

854
01:05:48,061 --> 01:05:49,901
I can't see myself
doing anything else.

855
01:05:52,821 --> 01:05:53,821
Pick one."

856
01:05:55,781 --> 01:05:56,741
"Palawan."

857
01:08:25,661 --> 01:08:26,941
If it's important,

858
01:08:31,661 --> 01:08:33,101
you can use mine.
