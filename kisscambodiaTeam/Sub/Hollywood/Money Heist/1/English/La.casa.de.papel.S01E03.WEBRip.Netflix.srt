1
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,520
Can I have a decaf, please?

2
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,760
"Hello, this is
Mariví's answering machine.

3
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,160
When you hear the beep,
you can leave a message."

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,040
Mum, I've just finished. It's...

5
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,640
Excuse me, do you have a phone charger?

6
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,920
No.

7
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,520
Do you want to use mine?

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,600
20 HOURS INTO THE ROBBERY

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,200
-Really? Don't you mind?
-No, no.

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,240
Are you sure? Thanks.

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,240
I have to make a couple of calls.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,680
-It's all right.
-Thanks a lot.

13
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,200
SATURDAY 6:25 AM

14
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,720
Mum, I've just finished, I'm on my way.

15
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,240
"Superintendent Sánchez,
leave your message."

16
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,280
This is inspector Murillo.
I know it's late,

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,480
but I wanted to tell that,
if Intelligence is in charge,

18
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,080
due to I don't know
which type of diplomatic interests,

19
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,560
I'm not going to be your figurehead
while those thugs force their way there.

20
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,840
So I feel obliged...

21
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,920
to resign. Good night.

22
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,240
Good morning.

23
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,040
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

24
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,200
Excuse me, but you're...

25
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,400
It's you...

26
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,280
"I started telling
the story of a kidnapping,

27
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,760
because everybody will remember
those days of siege

28
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,640
in the Fábrica Nacional
de Moneda y Timbre.

29
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,640
The streets downtown were closed, all TV
channels broadcasted live for 24 hours,

30
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,840
the police burnt their academy manuals

31
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,200
and they didn't know
how to eat that pie in the sky

32
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,360
of those poor wretches trying to print
their own money,

33
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,680
but many other things happened
and nobody remembers them,

34
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,120
things that changed us all

35
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,880
to the point of not knowing
who the bad guys were...

36
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,400
and who the good guys were."

37
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,720
Excuse me,
when you negotiate with those people,

38
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,200
do you give them what they want
or do you just have a chinwag

39
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,560
to buy some time or...?

40
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,640
-Well, don't answer me, I just...
-Every case is different.

41
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,320
Sure, I'm sorry.

42
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,560
But...

43
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,920
But well, yes,

44
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,760
we try to calm things down
and buy some time.

45
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,680
Thanks.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,200
"In fact, we were the ones buying time,

47
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,080
the sentence time is money
had never been better used.

48
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,200
A lot of money.

49
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,960
Every hour we printed eight million euros,

50
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,280
1,400 sheets of paper money
from which we cut

51
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,840
140,000 50 euro notes.

52
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,320
Everything was so calm
during the hours of dawn

53
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,280
that it seemed the plan
was going smoothly.

54
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,760
The Professor was our Big Brother,

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,520
controlled the police radio
and 18 cameras,

56
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,520
so if somebody wanted to fuck us,

57
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,120
we'd knew it well in advance.

58
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,400
We took turns to watch the hostages,
the entries and of course the production.

59
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,400
After only 20 hours there

60
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,520
the presses had already spit
52 million euros,

61
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,600
so at that point
we all thought it was possible.

62
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,720
But all that calm was just the dead calm

63
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,720
before the storm,
things were going to screw up so much

64
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,360
we would be on the brink
of losing the game.

65
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,720
And if you ask me why,

66
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,520
I'll say it's due to a simple love story.

67
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,320
After all, love is a good reason
to make everything go wrong."

68
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,920
I'd like to ask you a favour.

69
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,520
May I?

70
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,440
"There's movement,
everyone get ready."

71
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,360
Deputy inspector,
they're opening the doors.

72
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,160
"There are seven men,
armed with M-16s, sir."

73
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,000
Don't do anything, all right?

74
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,800
-It's a unique opportunity.
-Don't do anything.

75
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,200
Take off your mask.

76
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,720
I'm begging you, please, not to shoot.

77
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,960
My name's Mónica Gaztambide.

78
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,640
She's a hostage.

79
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,280
I'm just here to read a statement.

80
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,640
I'm speaking on behalf of the robbers.

81
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,080
We're 67 hostages,

82
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,400
all of us in perfect health
and well cared of.

83
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,760
There are no victims or wounded.
We're all dressed alike

84
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,280
and it's impossible to tell us
from the robbers,

85
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,160
so any attempts of assault

86
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,200
-could cost the lives...
-"The Dalí with the megaphone

87
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,080
-is giving her orders.
-The one with the megaphone is a robber."

88
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,960
"I request the green light, sir.

89
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,480
Target at range.

90
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,880
They're coming in, last chance, sir.

91
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,640
Last chance, sir.

92
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,920
They're coming in, I repeat,
they're coming in."

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,200
No, don't shoot.

94
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,880
Don't shoot, do you hear me? Let them in,

95
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,280
let them go back in.
Do you hear me? Let them in.

96
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,800
"As we have just seen,
the robbers have read a statement

97
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,880
where they said they regret
having hurt the police officers."

98
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,360
It seems the hostages
are in perfect health

99
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,880
"and the assailants
do not intend to use violence."

100
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,960
"My daughter, I know
you don't like Paula sleeping in your bed,

101
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,640
but she insisted
and I didn't want to argue with her.

102
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,880
Don't get angry."

103
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,840
We're locked up

104
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,640
and we really don't know
how long this could last,

105
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,200
but as long as they don't blow
my head up, I'll take care of you.

106
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,560
As long as you don't try to trick me,
or communicate with the outside,

107
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,400
everything will be fine.

108
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,640
From now on we're getting organized.

109
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,040
We're giving you some tasks
so you don't feel down.

110
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,240
-What's your name?
-Pablo.

111
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,800
Do you do any exercise?

112
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,560
Yes, I'm the athletic captain at school.

113
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,480
Step forward, captain.

114
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,000
Step forward.

115
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,240
Man!

116
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,800
Arturito.

117
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,560
-Did you sleep well?
-Well, yes.

118
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,560
Fine. Tell me, are you good at DIY?

119
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,640
No, no, sir, I'm totally hopeless.

120
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,600
In fact, when I have a flat tyre,
my wife changed it.

121
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,920
Are you telling me you don't have a drill?

122
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,480
-No.
-Think carefully what you say,

123
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,880
because I have
a fucking lie detector right here.

124
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,640
Yes.

125
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,960
Let's see... Second chance.
Are you good at DIY?

126
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,000
-I hold my own.
-Step forward.

127
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,600
Would you feel better
if we brought you an anxiolytic?

128
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,960
-Yes, please.
-Very well.

129
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,680
-Does anyone else need medication?
-Me. I'm diabetic.

130
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,320
-Come with Sonsoles, please.
-And me. I'm taking sertraline.

131
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,560
Anyone else?

132
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,320
Me.

133
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,080
I'd like to ask for an abortion pill.

134
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,160
You said you don't know
how many days we'll be here

135
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,280
and I'd like to sort this out
as soon as possible.

136
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,640
You'll get it today. You, come with me,

137
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,760
I'm taking you to Mr Román's office,
you'll be more relaxed there.

138
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,920
I also have a request.

139
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,520
Yes?

140
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,240
I'd like to erase a picture
from the internet.

141
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,880
I'm sorry, that's not in my hands.

142
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,400
I've been tricked,
they took me to a toilet

143
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,120
and they got a picture of me naked.

144
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,720
And now my parents, my teachers,
all the media are seeing it.

145
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,880
You can record a message,
a video, so they calm down,

146
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,280
and we'll send it.

147
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,920
All of you will be allowed
to record messages for your families.

148
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,440
Nairobi, come on.

149
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,160
Come on, tough guys,
your hands behind your head

150
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,680
and move to the left in a row,
sticking your chests out

151
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,920
as if you were the national team.
Move, athlete.

152
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,160
Do you see this dotted line?

153
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,960
You're going to break the concrete
not going one centimetre away from it,

154
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,840
as if it were a cut-out for children.

155
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,440
There are 48 metres downward
until you get to the sewer pipe.

156
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,320
The shift will last three hours.
And when you finish your shift

157
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,360
and you go back with the hostages,
not a fucking word

158
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,080
about what we're doing down here.

159
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,360
-Any questions?
-No.

160
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,720
That's good, that means I was clear.

161
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,120
Come on, let's get to work.
You, put on the hearing protection

162
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,160
-and take the hammer.
-I've never used one of those.

163
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,840
There's a first time for everything.

164
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,520
And be careful.

165
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,600
You wouldn't be the first one
to lose a foot with that.

166
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,360
-"Dad, mum, I'm fine."
-In Spanish, please.

167
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,840
Hi, dad. Hi, mum.

168
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,720
I'm fine, they feed us
and I've slept in a bag.

169
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,280
Mum, this is not awful, okay?
There's no violence.

170
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,000
"Mum", mum.

171
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,040
I guess you've seen the photo
I uploaded on the internet.

172
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,320
I didn't upload that photo and it doesn't
have to do with the kidnapping,

173
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,600
it was a classmate who tricked me and...

174
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,760
I can't.

175
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,360
Do not give so much importance
to this photo. It's...

176
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,080
It's just like when you go topless
on the beach, you know?

177
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,040
Nobody cares.

178
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,080
I don't go topless on the beach.

179
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,320
And I don't kiss with boys
in the toilets of a museum.

180
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,800
When my arm was put in a cast
it was the most exciting thing

181
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,120
that happened to me this year.

182
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,320
A kidnapping is more exciting.

183
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,400
Well, think about
what you're telling your parents, okay?

184
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,000
And calm down, I'll wait for you. Here.

185
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,840
-You're serious. What's wrong?
-Why the fuck do you care?

186
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,960
I'm just a child, the bedtime hobby
of the last five months, right?

187
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,600
The silly guy with the badge.

188
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,160
I said you were a child
and that I never would be with you

189
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,320
so that you didn't get a bullet
in your breastbone,

190
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,520
because I don't give a damn
if it's me who gets it.

191
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,720
You don't believe that,
you didn't do it for me.

192
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,400
What's the matter with you all?

193
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,080
Since I came here
you're always making scenes.

194
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,760
They've turned on a phone.

195
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,200
It's Alison Parker's.

196
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,000
Hack it.

197
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,480
You know what's up?
I'm sure you waited for us

198
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,320
to get out of Toledo to start with
all this fucking shit that I'm a child.

199
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,880
She's trying to log in in her profile.

200
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,800
Come on, come on.

201
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,960
If I was your fucking gigolo,
just tell me.

202
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,880
You were my fucking gigolo.

203
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,560
You were everything.

204
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,000
-I'm inside.
-Record it.

205
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,360
I don't want to go on
with this conversation.

206
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,920
You have the fucking nerve
to tell me you're mourning

207
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,360
for your boyfriend, right?
You didn't seem to be mourning

208
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,320
when you asked me
to push you against the wall.

209
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,840
I didn't see the rosary
among your fingers.

210
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,320
If you ever talk to me that way,
I'll smash your face.

211
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,280
Change to selfie camera.

212
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,200
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

213
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,840
-No, no!
-Fucking hell, give me that!

214
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,800
Hold on!

215
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,480
It's offline.

216
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,160
Rewind.

217
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,480
Stop it. Double the pixels.

218
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,240
We've got him.

219
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,320
-They're going to kill us.
-But what are you saying?

220
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,840
-They're going to kill us.
-Hush!

221
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,160
And then they'll run away
using the tunnel we're making for them.

222
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,600
-It'll be a slaughter.
-Shut up, you don't know anything.

223
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,880
Think for a while, huh? Do you think they
are so stupid as to let us free

224
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,400
so we go to the police station
to recognise them? Think, jeez.

225
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,120
-We're fucked.
-Two times they've told me

226
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,440
I'm a dead man.

227
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,400
-Look what's under the canvas.
-Huh?

228
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,880
Look what's under them.
I'm not staying here

229
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,440
waiting like a guinea pig
on my knees to be killed

230
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,720
without doing anything.
Look under the canvas,

231
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,640
see if you find weapons at least, come on.

232
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,960
Hello?

233
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,960
"You call me at 6 in the morning
and leave a confusing message

234
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,800
where you talk about being a figurehead,

235
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,080
thugs and empty words.
Well, I'm not bearing that in mind."

236
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,840
You resign and leave a robbery
with 67 hostages inside.

237
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,800
"I'm phoning you

238
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,400
so you can fucking tell me
that you won't be in charge of the case."

239
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,040
I will be in charge of it.

240
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,920
Raquel, there are things
which are above you.

241
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,080
"National Security,
the Foreign Office, the CNI..."

242
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,000
But, remember well,
you're the only person I know

243
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,720
"who can solve this without violence."

244
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,880
Thanks, superintendent.

245
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,800
And now go back to that tent
and take the lead.

246
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,080
We have the face of one of the robbers.

247
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,400
-I'll cover you, come on.
-No way, no way.

248
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,640
Put your gut into it.
What's the matter, captain?

249
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,480
-No way, no way.
-Weren't you the captain

250
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,160
-of the rugby team?
-Athletics.

251
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,240
Hurry then.

252
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,360
There are containers.

253
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,600
-It's petrol.
-Jesus!

254
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,520
-And ammunition.
-Holy shit!

255
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,440
What's that?

256
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,520
Are they drugs?

257
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,560
This is heroin. It's heroin, man.

258
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,000
Jeez, leave that right now,
it's the fucking plastic explosive.

259
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,240
Leave it, come to dig, come to dig.

260
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,840
Can anybody tell me why that machine

261
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
-isn't working?
-We're resting.

262
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,400
You'll rest when I tell you.
Or when it's your turn.

263
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,640
Okay, we'll go back to it right now.

264
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,040
Inspector, please.

265
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,840
Inspector, is there a conflict
between Intelligence and the Police?

266
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,880
Were the negotiations cancelled
because of your family situation

267
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,120
-after your complaint for ill-treatment?
-What?

268
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,400
That's all, okay?

269
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,800
-How does that scum know that?
-I don't know.

270
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,000
You're already back?

271
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,120
-Have you got a minute?
-Sure.

272
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,600
Colonel Prieto.

273
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,160
Look, I've been a bit nervous
these last hours,

274
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,480
but I'd like our relationship
to be a little smoother.

275
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,600
I think both of us
can contribute a lot in this crisis.

276
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,080
I appreciate your "mea culpa."
So here I am,

277
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,360
completely at your disposal.
But I want you to know,

278
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,920
before there are any misunderstandings,

279
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,600
that I'm a married man.

280
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,880
Raquel, Raquel.

281
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,000
A male, not older than 25, we recorded him
with Alison Parker's mobile phone.

282
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,160
Identity?

283
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,800
We're on it, facial recognition
are checking the PERPOL.

284
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,360
-I want to see the whole video.
-Play the image.

285
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,800
We couldn't record more than six seconds.

286
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,120
Stop it there.

287
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,840
It looks like a Makarov.

288
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,360
No, it's a Strizh 9mm, it's also Russian.

289
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,640
It's rare to see them here.

290
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,320
Tell the judicial police to question

291
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,400
all the informers from the East
in control of the black market.

292
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,800
-What's that on the wall?
-Telephones.

293
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,640
Play the images of the back camera.

294
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,960
What do the labels say? Enlarge.

295
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,920
The hostage list?

296
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,360
They're their phones.

297
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,680
Recognition can have his identity

298
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,760
-in an hour or two.
-No, we're not waiting so long.

299
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,120
Don't you find striking
such a special connection?

300
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,360
"I was just about to call you,
at this very moment."

301
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,320
Well, considering I'm the negotiator
and you the robber...

302
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,080
But we shouldn't allow this crime
interfere with our relationship.

303
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,200
Don't know about you,
but I see this as a chance.

304
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,680
-"A chance for what?"
-To get to know each other.

305
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,640
"I assure you that if we had met in a bar,

306
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,880
you wouldn't have paid
any attention to me.

307
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,400
Tell me, inspector."

308
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,360
Have you ever faked an orgasm?

309
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,040
No.

310
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,800
Please, inspector,
I beg you, don't lie to me.

311
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,440
Think about it, please.

312
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,000
Maybe yes, maybe I've done it.

313
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,480
Look, men are programmed to ejaculate
within the shortest time.

314
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,600
"Women, to last
the longest time possible."

315
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,560
And that small feature of nature
sometimes is solved with a fake orgasm.

316
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,440
And that's nothing but a small swindle.

317
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,200
A lie.

318
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,200
"Such as last evening's intervention,
with three elite corps.

319
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,960
Inspector, I'm begging you
not to lie to me,

320
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,920
you'll put at risk innocent people."

321
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,840
I won't. And now tell me,
why did you want to call me?

322
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,120
Look, we need food and some medication:

323
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,960
insulin, sertraline, albuterol,
an abortion pill

324
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,280
-"and anxiolytics."
-An abortion pill?

325
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,840
Requests from the hostages.

326
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,680
We all have personal problems,
don't you think?

327
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,840
-You'll get those requests.
-"Fine.

328
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,240
Civil Protection will make the delivery,

329
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,960
in transparent bags
to avoid hidden weapons.

330
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,120
And now tell me,

331
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,680
-you phoned me to..."
-So you surrender immediately.

332
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,120
I've got images from the inside,

333
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,560
"I've got the identity of one of your men.

334
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,120
If I keep on pulling the thread,

335
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,600
I'll know the identity
of the rest of the gang."

336
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
Inspector, I think...

337
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,920
"I'm offering you a deal
with the public prosecutor."

338
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,600
I can lower your sentences
from 16 to 8 years,

339
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,280
if you get out of there right now.

340
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,920
"Nobody has died
and that gives me a little margin."

341
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,200
I don't think it's a fair deal,
we lose out.

342
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,320
"You've already lost."

343
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,080
Look, in the rare event
you get out of there,

344
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,400
your faces will be in the news,

345
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,080
"police stations and borders.

346
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,240
You're left without a plan B."

347
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,560
-"Then we'll activate plan C."
-You think I'm bluffing, right?

348
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,960
Frankly, yes.

349
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,800
I'll tell you something
so you see I'm not lying:

350
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,520
"you've got 67 mobile phones
attached with velcro on the wall."

351
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,840
I give you one hour to accept my offer.

352
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,040
"Listen, inspec...."

353
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,320
We must call the police
and guide them through the assault.

354
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,320
There's a phone in my office,
in a coat that's hanging

355
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,960
-"from a hanger.
-No way."

356
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,600
-Listen, you've had 40 seconds...
-You go!

357
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,840
I can't, I can't.

358
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,960
You know what'd happen
if there's somebody there?

359
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,360
-They'd shoot me.
-Just like...

360
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,920
I want to hear
that machine working, jeez!

361
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,520
-I don't want to say that again!
-Sorry, sorry, we're sorry.

362
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,160
-He's very tired. Sorry.
-I can't go on.

363
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
-Sorry.
-I can't go on.

364
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,800
-I'm going to die, I can't go on.
-Come on, get out of there.

365
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,880
Get out and rest.

366
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,320
"Hello, Professor?"

367
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,840
They have an image
of all the phones on the wall.

368
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,720
There are no security cameras
there, right?

369
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,760
"No, of course not, only the one we set."

370
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,240
So it was one of the hostages.

371
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,040
You missed a phone, so find it

372
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,760
-or we're screwed.
-"Give me permission to punish him.

373
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,800
Either we block them with panic
or they'll keep on playing the heroes."

374
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,000
-What punishment?
-"An exemplary punishment.

375
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,080
-His execution, for example?"
-No.

376
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,640
Find that phone.

377
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,760
Are you really going to abort?

378
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,920
Sorry about what I said yesterday, Mónica.

379
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,000
It was out of place, I was an arsehole.

380
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,840
I've never been a very brave guy,
you know?

381
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,680
I've spent all my fucking life
doing what the others wanted from me,

382
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,360
never what I wanted to do.

383
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,880
And I needed to be
in a situation such as this, jeez,

384
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,480
with guns and bullets,

385
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,320
to realise what I really want.

386
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,760
And I'm going to think about me.

387
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,360
Me and you.

388
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,360
And that baby you have inside.

389
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,880
I love you, Mónica.

390
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,080
I love you so much, that I know.

391
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,480
You're the best
that's ever happened to me.

392
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,160
I want you to continue with the pregnancy
and I want you to let me be his father.

393
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,040
We're going to have a baby.

394
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,800
And I want to form a family with you
if we get out of here.

395
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,680
What do you mean, if we get out?

396
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,960
-They're digging a tunnel.
-What?

397
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,920
Yes, they have a lot of plastic explosive
and petrol containers.

398
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,120
-Stand up!
-It'll be a slaughter.

399
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,520
There's one way: contact the police
and guide them in the assault.

400
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,320
I've got a phone in my office,
in the coat.

401
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,880
I don't know how to get there.

402
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,720
-I'll go.
-No, no, no.

403
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,800
There's always a hero...

404
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,400
who thinks he can save the others.

405
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,760
Who thinks...

406
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,240
nobody will notice that he's plotting

407
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,800
a strategy to contact the police.

408
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,000
Bravo.

409
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,560
Congratulations,
because one of you made it,

410
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,280
recorded an image from the inside

411
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,720
and sent it to the police.

412
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,400
"Aníbal Cortés, born in Getafe."

413
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,040
He's an alarm expert, worked for two years

414
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,960
in security companies,
he's associated with the robbery

415
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,040
of a mansion in Geneva.

416
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,320
He's got a warrant issued by the Interpol.

417
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,720
So I'd like to give him
the chance to step forward

418
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,400
so you can all thank him.

419
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,920
And also give me that phone.

420
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,480
He must have visited the Casa de la Moneda
to study the alarm systems.

421
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,400
Check the hard drives
of the security company.

422
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,640
With a bit of luck, maybe he went there
with some other gang members.

423
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,680
Helsinki.

424
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,560
Undress him.

425
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,200
-Come on.
-Are you sick or what?

426
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,160
Pay attention.

427
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,080
Come on, take off your shirt.

428
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,680
-Come on.
-It was one of you.

429
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,080
I don't know who it was.

430
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,440
Denver, undress her.

431
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,200
You recorded a video

432
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,800
in the phone room, right?

433
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,240
-What's up?
-I can't breathe.

434
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,080
Let me go with the girls.
Let me go with the girls!

435
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,880
Berlin, I'm taking her away.

436
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,200
-Berlin, Berlin.
-What's the matter now?

437
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,600
I know what happened.

438
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,520
I got distracted for a while
and I saw Alison trying

439
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,200
to erase the fucking photo, that's all.
A mistake, that's all.

440
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,480
What's up,
have you got an attention deficit?

441
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,880
Because if you're
one of those children with problems,

442
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,880
I should be the first to know.

443
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,440
I haven't got any problems.

444
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,640
Tokyo came in, all right?
And we argued, that's it.

445
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,080
-It won't happen again.
-Now I see.

446
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,080
One more time, it all comes down
to a sentimental reason.

447
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,640
You don't know
how much you remind me of myself.

448
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,800
I was 18, she was 44,
she was my French teacher,

449
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,160
-I was outstanding.
-I don't know what this is about,

450
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,000
-Tokyo isn't 44.
-She's 15 years older than you.

451
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,960
And when you're young
and you're with a woman

452
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,880
who's halfway through,
everything seems even better.

453
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,200
They've got the experience
teenage girls don't have

454
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,800
and they're even more grateful
than the ugly ones.

455
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,080
My teacher gave me
her mature flesh every time

456
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,080
as if it were my fucking birthday.
You know why?

457
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,600
Because with you
they savour the lost youth,

458
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,640
before tumbling down the slope of age.

459
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,160
Of course...

460
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,400
Of course there's a small difference
between your love story and mine.

461
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,000
In my case, I wasn't
in a robbery with hostages,

462
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,440
endangering my mates' lives.

463
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,280
"An assault
to the epicentre of money,

464
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,080
the most outstanding robbery ever.

465
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,000
Bizarre robbery calls
international attention."

466
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,680
What do you think? Do you want a coffee?

467
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,560
Jesus, we have an officer in the ICU,

468
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,760
67 hostages,
a lot of guys armed to the teeth

469
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,520
and for the reporters
this is something colourful.

470
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,800
I don't care about the headlines,
what worries me

471
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,560
is that they have too much information
and that doesn't help us.

472
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,560
Are you okay?

473
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,240
I'm going out for lunch.
I'll be back in 15 minutes.

474
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,840
All right.
Listen, the inspector is coming out.

475
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,960
"Move the paparazzi away."

476
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,440
Leave the boxes on the ground
and go back really slowly.

477
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,600
"I've got a phone
in my office, in the coat."

478
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,400
It's very hot here.

479
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,000
The medicine.

480
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,520
I'm going...

481
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,040
Hey!

482
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,080
May I?

483
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,880
Sit down.

484
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,920
Sit down!

485
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,240
The medicine is here.

486
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,880
Hand them out.

487
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,800
-I'm going to sit down.
-Wait.

488
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,480
Come outside.

489
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,520
Come outside.

490
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,600
You may think
what I'm telling you is bullshit.

491
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,920
I don't think
abortion is a very good idea.

492
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,600
Thanks.

493
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,520
"The kidnappers have been locked up
in the Fábrica Nacional de Moneda...."

494
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,240
They're not leaving that place, right?

495
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,040
Those people, I mean.

496
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,760
You must be desperate
to do something like that, right?

497
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,320
That's what makes them so dangerous.

498
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,840
No, but they don't want to hurt anybody.

499
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,800
Well, that's what they said.

500
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,400
So they wouldn't be armed,
don't you think?

501
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,960
Sure, I guess you're right.

502
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,080
But you don't try to rob

503
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,800
the Fábrica de Moneda y Timbre
with a slingshot, right?

504
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,560
"The assailants were surprised by a patrol

505
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,760
while they were trying
to escape with bags of money

506
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,680
and they shot
the two officers who tried to...."

507
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,120
The bill, please.

508
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,040
And...? Do you know how many they are?

509
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,480
Because in some places
they say they're seven.

510
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,480
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

511
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,320
Hello?

512
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,880
"Raquel, the boy was at the museum."

513
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,600
How long ago?

514
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,080
"Three months ago, the cameras got him
as part of a guided tour."

515
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,680
Was he alone?

516
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,840
"No, you were right, he was with someone.
Listen, we have the identity

517
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,760
of another robber,
they sent you his picture

518
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,480
from judiciary police,
you should receive it right now."

519
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,600
Ah!

520
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,240
Ah!

521
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,840
-Where have you got it?
-What are you talking about?

522
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,240
-Where is the recorder?
-But what...?

523
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,480
It's a coincidence you're here every day

524
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,360
-asking me questions.
-I don't know...

525
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,720
-Who do you work for?
-Pardon?

526
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,120
-Who the fuck do you work for?
-I'm not a journalist,

527
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,680
my name's Salvador Martín,
look my wallet. Antonio, please.

528
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,680
-What's the matter, Salva?
-I don't know...

529
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,520
I know him, he comes here every day.

530
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,400
You need dough for the baby, right?

531
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,760
-Yes.
-No, no...

532
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:45,920
Yes. Listen, this is a robbery,
you may get something for you.

533
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,640
No, not really.

534
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,720
Hide this in your underwear now.

535
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,920
20,000 bucks, you can buy nappies for him

536
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
-until he leaves university.
-It's not that.

537
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,280
It's really not that.
I appreciate it, but...

538
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,200
Give me the pill
and I'm going back inside.

539
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,800
Fine.

540
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,920
So what's up?

541
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,360
-He'll screw up your life.
-Pardon?

542
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,520
Your son.
It's better he screws up your life

543
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,840
rather than any
of these motherfuckers, or me.

544
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,760
-Are you going to screw up my life?
-Life gets screwed up very easily.

545
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,640
One day you're working smoothly,

546
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,480
four lunatics with Dalí masks come in,

547
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,320
one of them goes crazy,
he shoots his gun and fuck off.

548
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,080
This screws up your life.

549
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,040
Not a baby.

550
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,000
What do you know about what screws me
up? What do you know?

551
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,000
My mother wanted to abort me.

552
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,840
But first she had a snowy spliff
with the horse she had to sell

553
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,200
to pay the abortion.

554
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,920
And the municipal police
arrested her in a shitty portico.

555
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,840
I was born among the jail,
the drugs and the police.

556
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,920
And what do you know?

557
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,640
Because it seems your job
is not one adventure after another,

558
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,560
and when you go out
it isn't a party, either.

559
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,160
-Or do you do "kilates"?
-Pilates...

560
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,200
So I was right.
And you go for a drink on Friday.

561
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,760
Fucking shit, girl,
another plan screwed up due to the baby.

562
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,200
Who do you go out with?
Where are your friends?

563
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,440
I'll tell you. At home, with their babies.

564
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,400
Do they look screwed up? No, right?

565
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,200
What crazy thing do you do
that you can't do with a baby?

566
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,800
If his father is an arsehole
and he misses it, that's better,

567
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,400
all his affection for you.
Do you know how much he can love you?

568
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,600
What are you doing, Denver?

569
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,360
I'm giving her the pill to abort.

570
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,560
What's up?

571
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,200
Does she need you to put it in her mouth
with a little water?

572
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,960
Abortion is a private thing, right?

573
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,240
Women decide,
but not in front of everybody.

574
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,040
Anyway, I'm...

575
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,560
I'll think about it
until we get out of here.

576
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,720
Wonderful.

577
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,160
I'm glad you want to continue
with the pregnancy. Really.

578
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,200
Now go back to the office with the others.

579
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,600
Did you just come from a stag party?

580
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,120
Or were you going there?

581
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,160
"That wasn't the first time
Berlin put his hand

582
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,920
in the knickers of an honest woman,

583
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,840
but it'd be the first time
he'd take it out so soon.

584
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,960
Maybe Mónica would have preferred
him to let himself go,

585
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,120
follow his instinct
and forget about the phone

586
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,520
that had rung between her legs,
but it wasn't so ."

587
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,560
Denver.

588
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,880
What will happen with our authority
when I tell the others?

589
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,800
"Even Berlin could
distinguish pleasure from duty."

590
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,160
Kill her.

591
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,160
You heard me.

592
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,440
Let's see.

593
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,680
"For the first time I realised
there was something

594
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,800
that had always been wrong
in all my love affairs.

595
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,880
They had always taken care of me.

596
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,800
But this time it'd be different."

597
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,880
What's up? Jesus, Tokyo, Tokyo. Tokyo!

598
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,160
Jesus, go and find Berlin.

599
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,920
"Listen to me. If anybody
touches him again,"

600
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,640
I swear to God that the next shot

601
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,000
will be against Helsinki,
Berlin or against you.

602
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,880
You're out there, free,
while we're risking

603
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,800
"our fucking lives in this mouse trap."

604
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,000
What?

605
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,680
"Helsinki, put the gun down."

606
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,800
What are you doing?

607
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,880
Helsinki.

608
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,720
Helsinki.

609
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,200
Put the gun down.

610
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,000
Don't do it, please.

611
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,920
Why did you have to get
that fucking phone?

612
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:34,880
Sorry.

613
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,760
Why the hell did you have to trick me?

614
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,440
Tokyo...

615
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,800
Rio, don't!

616
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,840
Where do you think you're going?
You did more than enough today.

617
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,320
Helsinki.

618
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,720
Do you know what will happen
if I don't kill you?

619
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,280
-They'll kill me.
-No...

620
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,920
And then they'll kill you.

621
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,600
So now what?

622
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:15,160
"I wasn't even listening to my shouts,
I only wanted to write

623
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,880
a fucking love letter.
While the guns and the gazes

624
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,040
were pointing at me,
reality fell like a concrete slab

625
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:25,560
and I knew the five months
during which I had believed in something

626
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,920
were over."

627
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,640
Your love story has fucked up
your escape plan.

628
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,320
"They've got you."

629
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,080
"And Rio too,
the police know who you are."

630
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,440
"You're in every news programme."

631
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,240
For fuck's sake.

632
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,000
For fuck's sake, man.

633
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,640
Come on, man.

634
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,640
Come on, man.

635
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,280
Ah...

636
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,520
Ah...

637
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:22,800
On your knees.

638
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,400
No.

639
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,360
Don't look at me.

640
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,920
Don't look at me.

641
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,000
-Please.
-Don't fucking look at me.

642
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,960
Don't fucking look at me.
