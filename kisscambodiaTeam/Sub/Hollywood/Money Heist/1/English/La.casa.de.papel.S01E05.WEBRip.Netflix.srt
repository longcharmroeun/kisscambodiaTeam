1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,320
-"I’m waiting for instructions.
-I have a shot at the kidnapper."

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,160
-What the fuck are you doing?
-There are fucking snipers.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,000
-On your knees.
-"They’re aiming."

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,680
-Give me the green light.
-"They’re going to execute them.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,680
-They’re going to shoot.
-I request to open fire."

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,600
Put down the gun!

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,720
"They’re going to kill them."

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,080
Green light.

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,080
-Condor 3, open fire.
-Behind you.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,680
SATURDAY
06:00 PM

11
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,320
Good! Good, Mr Torres. Good. Very good.

12
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,680
But now let’s change the series, okay?

13
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,920
Let’s change the letter, all right?

14
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,080
Another country, yes.
Don’t complain. Come on.

15
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,800
Helsinki! Come down, hurry up.

16
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,440
-What have we got?
-He’s seriously injured. Hurry up!

17
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,600
You killed her, motherfuckers.

18
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,640
Hurry up.

19
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,720
Water, water, please.

20
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,480
Water, please. Water.

21
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,240
Thanks. Arturo, hold on tight. Rio, Rio!

22
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,680
Alcohol, alcohol.

23
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,680
I need you to take your hand off...

24
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,560
-Raquel.

25
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,760
"Ex-employees of the paper money factory

26
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,120
have revealed the identity
of the man hurt by the police.

27
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,920
It’s Arturo Román,
the general manager of the factory,

28
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,280
who has just been hurt
by the police forces,

29
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,360
while he was on the roof with the robbers.

30
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,600
The events took place after 32 hours
since the beginning of the kidnapping."

31
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,200
32 HOURS OF ROBBERY

32
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
I need to talk to my wife, please.

33
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,480
I need to talk to my wife.

34
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,280
"They say that when we’re at Death’s door

35
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,280
we’re finally able to see
our life with clarity.

36
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,000
And Arturo Román, losing blood on a table,

37
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,080
was waiting for that:
Death’s clairvoyance.

38
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,520
To find out once and for all
who the love of his life had been.

39
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,320
Laura, the woman with whom
he had shared 14 years

40
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,320
of holy matrimony?

41
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,800
Or Mónica, his secretary and lover,

42
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,240
with whom he had felt young again?

43
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,640
Unfortunately, the only certainty
Arturo had at that moment

44
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,760
was that, if they didn’t take out
the bullet,

45
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,520
he’d kick the bucket
before solving the enigma.

46
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,800
And, frankly, our first aid courses
weren’t a guarantee for living."

47
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,080
Inferior cava.

48
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,480
Right renal.

49
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,320
Left.

50
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,160
Mesenteric.

51
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,440
Right pulmonary.

52
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,800
Left.

53
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,480
This is the heart.

54
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,600
Cava.

55
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,080
Subclavian, right and left.

56
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,840
Brachial.

57
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,080
Humeral.

58
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,680
Internal jugular.

59
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,680
External jugular.

60
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,360
And in red the main arteries.

61
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,240
Hey, stop, stop.

62
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,680
Let’s see.

63
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,040
Do you want us to learn medicine
this way, with two markers?

64
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,480
If anyone is shot,
he can’t go to a hospital.

65
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,360
You have to manage inside.

66
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,680
-It’ll be fucking suicide.
-Shut the fuck up.

67
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,760
One thing is
to lock ourselves up in that mouse trap.

68
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,760
-Another thing would be that we die.
-Denver.

69
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,720
We’re asking you to learn
how to take out a bullet.

70
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,360
Don’t start
with "the epic tales about the outskirts".

71
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,640
It’s not that hard.

72
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,120
You get the pliers, take out the bullet
without screwing it up.

73
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,240
-That’s all.
-The shot already screwed it up.

74
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,120
If they shoot me, take me to the hospital.

75
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,760
The answer is "no."

76
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,760
Well, I prefer being lame and free

77
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,040
rather than with excellent health
but in a cell.

78
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,160
Nobody will go out.

79
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,400
Anyone of you is a clue
and a thread that can be pulled.

80
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,280
If somebody wants to resign,
this is the moment.

81
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,240
He will stay here during the robbery
and then he’ll leave.

82
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,800
Will the lesson last long?

83
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,680
My willy is shrinking like Helsinki’s.

84
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,760
Hey! What did you say about my willy?

85
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,640
-Enough. Enough.
-Do you want to see my willy?

86
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,760
Please.

87
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,240
Come on, get dressed.
Let another one lie here, please.

88
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,400
-Mr Willy.
-Come on.

89
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
Come on.

90
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,320
-No? No, no...
-Well, there we go.

91
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,640
-Well...
-Come on, Nairobi.

92
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,480
-It’s all right, isn’t it?
-Come on, Nairobi!

93
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,960
So sexy!

94
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,760
-She’s black.
-Sexy, sexy.

95
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,600
-Go on.
-Wow! Okay.

96
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
Let’s see what you learnt.

97
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,960
This is the carotid...

98
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,960
"And so, playing doctors,

99
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,000
I found out Nairobi was
more interesting than she seemed."

100
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,160
The heart.

101
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,160
The aorta...

102
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,440
"And, although nobody knew anything
about anyone,..."

103
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,440
The abdominal aorta.

104
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,080
"...what I never had suspected
was that Nairobi had a son.

105
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Or a daughter.

106
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,200
As it seemed by her C-section scar."

107
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,240
-What are you doing? What are you doing?
-Hey, hey!

108
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,520
-Where are you going?
-What’s up?

109
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
What are you looking at?

110
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,520
-What’s up?
-Calm down.

111
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,000
No. You’re going to eat that marker.

112
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,880
-What’s up?
-She’s a bit of a lesbian.

113
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,960
Don’t know what the fuck she’s looking at.

114
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,920
You’re the lesbian. Your nugget
was as hard as a sugar cube.

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,440
As a sugar cube? I’m going to...

116
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,320
Stop it!

117
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,960
"And that’s where our friendship started."

118
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,880
Raquel, the Ministry on the phone.

119
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,960
What shall I tell them?
Raquel? What shall I say?

120
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,160
-Raquel! What shall I say?
-Pardon?

121
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,360
-They’ll ask who gave the order.
-I gave the order.

122
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,440
Tell them... the wounded man is a hostage.

123
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,400
-And hang up the fucking phone!
-He looked like a robber.

124
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,160
I asked for the green light. I insisted.

125
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,800
Inspector, I assume
responsibility with you.

126
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,800
Inspector, the ambulance is ready.

127
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,040
Let’s talk to the kidnapper.

128
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,960
"Preparing the communication
with the kidnapper."

129
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,640
We had to make a decision. They were...

130
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,560
It seemed they’d execute them,
we had to decide, there was no time.

131
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,920
Silence, please!

132
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,680
Professor?

133
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,040
"You fired upon the hostages.

134
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,400
One is between life and death.
I guess that’s why you’re calling."

135
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,280
I’ve got the ambulance
to evacuate the injured man.

136
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,880
Nobody’s getting out of here.

137
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,880
-That man is bleeding out.
-"Due to the bullet you shot."

138
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,800
Will you let him die?

139
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,200
"Let me get a medical team there."

140
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,680
Professor, listen.

141
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,960
I know it was my mistake,

142
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,400
"but if a hostage dies,
it’ll be as awful for you as for me.

143
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,160
Believe me, in less"

144
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,080
than five minutes
public opinion will know that

145
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,320
that man died

146
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,000
because you didn’t let us
come in and save his life.

147
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,120
"Two surgeons and a nurse
with surgical equipment.

148
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,560
-Let me know when they arrive."
-Thanks.

149
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,760
"I also have something to ask you."

150
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,920
The injured man wants to talk to his wife.

151
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,240
Of course.

152
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,560
Jesus.

153
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,160
Locate Mr Román’s wife.

154
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,040
When can the medical team be here?

155
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,680
By helicopter from La Paz,
10 or 15 minutes.

156
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,880
-Bring them here. Now!
-Okay.

157
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,040
Places everyone, come on.

158
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,560
Please, places everyone.

159
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,760
Excuse me.

160
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,720
Can you drive?

161
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,240
Yes, yes.

162
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,200
I need to get out of here, go for a drive.

163
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,600
-Yes.
-Thanks.

164
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
Hey, Raquel.

165
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,240
What’s up?

166
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,000
I have to think.

167
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,000
Drive.

168
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,760
Don’t look at me like that.
I’m not leaving you alone.

169
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,600
Where the fuck is she?

170
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,400
That bitch has escaped!

171
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,160
Let’s see...

172
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,160
I’m coming.

173
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,520
There we go.

174
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,200
Tell me, my child.

175
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,280
"Will you be able to come here tonight?"

176
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,440
-I don’t know, mum.
-"But why? What’s the matter?"

177
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,200
Mum, it’s...

178
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,200
I’m...

179
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,240
I made

180
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,840
"a very big mistake at work."

181
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,760
My child, your work is very difficult.

182
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,680
"Come on, tell me, there’s nothing"

183
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,440
that still seems so serious
five minutes after being told.

184
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,640
I was drinking wine with...

185
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,320
"I like that. With who?"

186
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,600
Do I know him?

187
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,560
No, mum. I don’t know him either.

188
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,480
The thing is...
When I came back to the tent,

189
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,160
there was a very serious situation,

190
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,200
"a risky one,
on the roof of the factory and...

191
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,800
I thought one of the hostages
was in danger,"

192
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,240
so I gave...

193
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,040
the order to open fire.

194
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,240
And an innocent man was shot.

195
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,280
-Yes. I’ve seen it on TV, my child.
-"Now I don’t know what to do."

196
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,800
I don’t know whether to phone his wife,

197
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,360
give a press conference, resign...
I don’t know what to do, mum.

198
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,920
Well, first of all, relax
and don’t blame yourself.

199
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,600
"They’re there with masks and guns,"

200
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,720
locked up, all jumbled up.

201
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,280
You only wanted
to protect the hostages, right?

202
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,760
"Honey... What if you had saved
somebody’s life?"

203
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,440
What? You wouldn’t be phoning me, right?

204
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,520
"Well...,

205
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,640
and now I..."

206
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,600
wouldn’t know that you meet strangers

207
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,400
"and have a drink with them."

208
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,320
God! I... I don’t meet strangers.

209
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,320
My child, we have
so little time in this life...

210
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,040
Okay, mum,
but that’s not the question now.

211
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,720
The question is I’m
in a critical situation at work.

212
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,040
Honey, send that work to hell.

213
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,520
"Why don’t you tell them
you want to stamp passports?

214
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,760
This way you may have some fun. Heavens!"

215
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,040
"Or do you think in the future you’ll be
holding hands with the kidnapper"

216
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,160
in an old people’s home?
You won’t, my child.

217
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,600
But maybe with that stranger...

218
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,480
"Don’t laugh, I know
what I’m talking about. I’ve been..."

219
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,120
a widow for 20 years and...

220
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,760
Time doesn’t stop, my child.

221
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,640
And it doesn’t go back either, you know?

222
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,240
-Getting in the perimeter.
-I’ll think about it, mum.

223
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,160
If you see it’s late, go to bed,
all right?

224
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,200
Fine.

225
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,000
Listen and you go to bed

226
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,360
"with someone too."

227
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,000
RACHEL LIKES A STRANGER

228
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,800
-What the fuck do you want?
-I don’t know. I saw that earlier and...

229
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,600
And it drew my attention.

230
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,040
I didn’t know what it was.

231
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,720
-Sorry.
-Okay, I forgive you.

232
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,920
Okay, see you later.

233
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,200
What are you doing?

234
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,320
Beat it, will you?
I don’t want any chitchat.

235
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,680
How old is he?

236
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,920
Your son.

237
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,600
Seven.

238
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,920
He’s seven.

239
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,600
Where’s he?

240
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,920
With his father?

241
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,120
With his father? Not with him.
He’s never been with his father.

242
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,000
We don’t know anything about his father.

243
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,440
What’s his name?

244
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,520
Axel.

245
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,000
His name’s Axel.

246
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,160
It means "axe."

247
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,080
-Axe.
-Yes.

248
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,040
-And he’s an ace.
-Right...

249
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,280
Just like his mother.

250
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,240
That child is a survivor, you know?

251
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,120
He has survived everything.

252
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,760
He’s like a cork in the middle of the sea,

253
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,320
he doesn’t sink.

254
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,120
That’s the way he is.

255
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,040
When he was three...

256
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,880
I had to take him away
from my mother’s house

257
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,680
because her husband...

258
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,320
gave him anisette when I wasn’t there,
because his sobs bothered him.

259
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,880
So I took him away.

260
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,520
Only the two of us, not needing a family.

261
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,760
Me and him.

262
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,240
And we were fucking great.

263
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,200
But I screwed it up.

264
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,800
One day...

265
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,480
I had to go to get pills to sell.

266
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,960
And...

267
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,120
And I left him alone.

268
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,240
For five minutes.

269
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,520
I’d be away five minutes, right?

270
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,440
And he made a mess

271
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,320
with the fucking Spider-Man.

272
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,680
I piss on Spider-Man!

273
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
Because he wanted to be a superhero.

274
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,160
He climbed everywhere.
He climbed very well.

275
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,000
And he got to the terrace
through the window.

276
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,360
There he took a chair, went on the chair

277
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,240
and shouted: "Mummy!"

278
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,840
"Mummy!"

279
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,040
He was three and a half.

280
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,880
Sure, five minutes later

281
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,400
we had a police patrol, the firemen...

282
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,680
Everybody.

283
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,080
They caught me with the pills,

284
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,160
with a record,

285
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,400
without a job.

286
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,680
And to prison I went.

287
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,680
So my child started moving
from one foster family to the next,

288
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
from hand to hand.

289
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,800
And I got nothing.

290
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,080
Nothing, huh?

291
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,880
I wasn’t allowed
a single visit, a single call...

292
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,000
Nothing.

293
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,720
Then I was released from prison...

294
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,440
and nothing happened.

295
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,440
They didn’t give him back to me.

296
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,600
-Have you seen him again?
-They won’t let me.

297
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,120
But...

298
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,760
I know where he is.

299
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,120
-Really?
-He’s in the Canary islands.

300
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,520
He’s with a family who owns a hotel.

301
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,760
He’s fine.

302
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,560
Are you going to go and get him?

303
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,400
I’m taking him...

304
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,920
and that’s final.

305
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,160
To the other side of the world.

306
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,280
I’m telling you one thing.

307
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,080
In this robbery

308
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,160
nobody’s going to screw it up,
me or anyone,

309
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,880
if somebody makes a mess of it,
I’ll destroy his life.

310
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,960
Of all the plans all these people have,

311
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,520
yours...

312
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,040
is the best.

313
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,400
And I’m telling you another thing...

314
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,880
Do you like tequila?

315
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,600
It’s 4:03 am.

316
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,360
There’s a lesson early in the morning.

317
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,240
Plastic explosive.

318
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,720
Sorry.

319
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,200
It’d be great if you were
rested for the class.

320
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,640
-We couldn’t sleep.
-Go to bed.

321
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,000
-The three of us together?
-Each of us to their bed.

322
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,240
The pyjamas look
really good on you, Professor.

323
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,440
Now.

324
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,480
Now.

325
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,960
And you... And you with the lights.

326
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,880
That guy really turns me on,
he really turns me on.

327
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,800
-He really turns me on!
-Really? I can’t tell at all.

328
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,920
Can you notice?

329
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,400
-A lot.
-Let him notice.

330
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,640
What a racket, man!

331
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,640
Jesus...

332
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,600
Mónica. Hey... Hey.

333
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,680
-What are you doing here? Are you crazy?
-I wasn’t feeling very well.

334
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,960
I think it’s the medicine, it got me sick.

335
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,920
The medicine.

336
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,200
That will be it, the medicine.
Yes, child. That’ll be it.

337
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,360
Oh my, you’re boiling like a kettle.

338
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,360
She must get the hell out of here.

339
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,400
-I’ll help you.
-Wait, wait.

340
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,600
Could you leave me alone

341
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,600
-for a while?
-Yes.

342
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,960
Please.

343
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,400
What do you think?

344
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,280
She’s not feeling very well.
She looks bad.

345
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,000
If we don’t take that bullet out bullet,
she’s fucked.

346
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,800
Dad, calm down, all right?

347
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,280
She’ll be fine.

348
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,160
Why did you fucking shoot her?

349
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,360
Because Berlin was going to kill her.
I had no other choice.

350
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,440
Son of a bitch.

351
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,200
If he wants to kill somebody,
he should pull the trigger, not you.

352
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,960
We came for a robbery.

353
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,560
Not to kill people. Or to save lives.

354
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,240
We’re fucking wretches, jeez.

355
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,800
-Of all the people...
-Dad, calm down.

356
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,000
Calm down.

357
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,000
Mónica, have you finished yet?

358
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,520
Yes.

359
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,200
-Let’s go.
-Raquel, wait a second.

360
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,360
I want to talk to you.

361
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,320
I want to infiltrate the medical team.

362
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,440
No. Somebody’s getting in, but not you.

363
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,120
Sure. There’s always
someone better than me for everything.

364
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,720
Raquel, I’m a firearms expert.

365
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,240
I can get there and, at a glance,
know how many they have,

366
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,920
what type and if they’re fake or not.

367
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,480
We can know who the robbers are.

368
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,280
You’re right.

369
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,760
You’ll come with me and cover the doctors.

370
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,400
Now I’ll tell you what we’re doing.

371
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,000
I heard a shot before.

372
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,040
The police. They shot a hostage.

373
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,920
-A hostage?
-Yes.

374
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,320
Who?

375
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,080
Who?

376
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,920
Who did the police shoot?

377
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,320
The manager of the factory.

378
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,600
Arturo?

379
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,800
Did the police kill Arturo?

380
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,160
No. They didn’t kill him.

381
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,440
-Is he okay?
-Yes.

382
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,440
Is he alive?

383
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,280
-Is Arturo okay?
-He’s fine. Yes.

384
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,640
-Are you sure?
-Sure.

385
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,400
-Is he okay?
-A surgeon is coming in.

386
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,440
With his team.

387
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,480
He’ll have surgery and will be saved.

388
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,880
-Is he having surgery?
-Yes.

389
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,200
You must tell him I’m alive.

390
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,440
You must tell Arturo.

391
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,280
-Do you hear me?
-Nobody is telling anything.

392
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,880
Because you’ll be fine
and he will as well, okay?

393
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,000
Come on. Let’s have a look at the wound.

394
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,680
Calm down.

395
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,960
He is going to blame himself.
I took the phone because he told me to.

396
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,720
And that now I’m dead because of him.

397
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,760
You must tell him I’m alive, okay?

398
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,720
And his son too.

399
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,560
Are you pregnant?

400
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,440
Very well.

401
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,040
Congratulations.

402
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,720
-Give me a pen, please.
-Okay.

403
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,040
When?

404
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,120
Thanks.

405
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,800
Ángel!

406
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,960
I’ve decided to get our officers
inside the building.

407
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,400
I’ll do it by taking advantage
of the medical intervention.

408
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,440
I celebrate these decisions you make
during ambulance rides.

409
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,400
But my presence here responds
only to the government’s wish

410
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,040
that there isn’t a violent outcome.

411
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,200
Wow!

412
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,400
The CNI officer
has suddenly become a pacifist.

413
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,240
Weren’t you the one
who wanted to get the tanks in there?

414
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,840
I wanted to catch them by surprise.
Finish with this soon.

415
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,520
But now the priority is zero victims.

416
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,440
So I advise to negotiate and wait.

417
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,120
It must suck a lot being here all day

418
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,000
believing you’re the best,
not having to make any decisions, right?

419
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,320
Like being in a hostage crisis talk show.

420
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,320
Inspector, I’m not going to bite

421
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,760
because I understand at a certain age
hormones take over inside.

422
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,480
-I know it because of my mother.
-Where are you going?

423
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,800
As you’ll understand,
I have to inform about all this.

424
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,120
Of course.

425
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,560
So far the kidnappers
have always been ahead of us.

426
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,280
Everything was planned. Except this shot.

427
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,520
It’s the first thing
not according to plan.

428
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,000
And we must take advantage.

429
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,520
The only way to get in
without being detected by their cameras

430
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,120
is to advance
along this tube in the subsoil

431
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,320
that leads straight to the basements.

432
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,040
It’s the ventilation nozzle.

433
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,720
It was added seven months ago
to release the heat from the presses.

434
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,800
It’s a work in progress.

435
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,440
-They probably won’t know it’s there.
-I need two of your men to get in there.

436
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,000
Officer García Lobo,
here, and I’ll go with him.

437
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,120
Fine. Deputy Inspector Rubio

438
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,160
"will go with the two surgeons
and will get in as a nurse."

439
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,960
06:09 pm. Synchronize watches.

440
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,640
"At 06:15 pm
the medical team will come in.

441
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,480
According to the head of internal medicine

442
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,680
the surgery
won’t take more than 30 minutes."

443
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,320
But they can go on exactly until 7:00 pm.

444
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,160
When the doctors go out,

445
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,960
there’ll be a big number
of kidnappers to watch them.

446
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,280
That’s when Suárez and Lobo
will get in through the subsoil.

447
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,000
"They’ll get to the basement’s catch basin
dressed with red overalls and Dalí masks."

448
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,760
They’ll infiltrate among the hostages.

449
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,160
We’ll only be successful
if we do it like clockwork.

450
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,640
Inspector!

451
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,920
-Arturo Román’s wife is here.
-One moment, please.

452
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,960
Suárez, get moving.

453
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,400
Take care of the doctors. And be careful.

454
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,160
Get the operation ready!

455
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,360
What happened? Is my husband okay?

456
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,640
Your husband is conscious and stable.

457
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,200
He was shot by mistake.

458
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,840
-Shot? What do you mean?
-He’s injured, but alive.

459
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,320
Calm down. Calm down.

460
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,720
The kidnappers allow us
to get in a surgical team

461
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,440
and he’ll have surgery immediately.

462
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,040
Sorry, but...
I wasn’t even listening, sorry.

463
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,080
Calm down.

464
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,160
Everything’s gonna be all right.

465
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,480
-Sit down, please.
-Thanks.

466
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,800
-Can you talk to him right now?
-Yes.

467
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,680
Take this.

468
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,120
Almansa, record it!

469
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,160
We must take that bullet out right now.

470
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,760
You do it, dad.

471
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,120
You’re more cold-blooded.

472
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,560
Where’s the surgical kit
the Professor gave us?

473
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,480
-There’s a scalpel there.
-Berlin’s got it.

474
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,040
Jesus.

475
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,480
I don’t think it’s a good idea
to ask him for it.

476
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,920
The surgeons!
Go and steal their tools. Hurry.

477
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,040
-Okay.
-Wait! Wait!

478
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,040
Give him the note, please.

479
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,400
I’ll clean the wound now, okay?

480
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,080
Relax. You’re going to be fine.

481
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,440
-"Hello?"
-Professor, Arturo Román’s wife is here.

482
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,320
Okay.

483
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,120
Arturo.

484
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,400
Arturo!

485
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,440
What’s your wife’s name?

486
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,120
Laura.

487
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,280
What a beautiful name.
Well, you can talk to Laura.

488
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,600
Wives are good for moments like these.

489
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,240
They’re comforting.

490
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,080
Nobody remembers his wife
when you’re in front

491
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,000
of the disco, high as a kite, but...

492
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:45,640
If you have a problem, an accident
or... you’re simply scared,...

493
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,520
things change.

494
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,840
Are you thinking
about your secretary right now?

495
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,000
Huh? Yes?

496
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,960
No.

497
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,760
But who can think about lovers

498
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,760
with babies who could be aborted...

499
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,520
-or simply nothing?
-Spare me the speech, will you?

500
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,440
Listen to me.

501
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,680
If you say something weird,

502
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,200
I’ll give you the coup de grace

503
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,320
and your wife will hear it live.
Understand?

504
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,200
Inspector!

505
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,160
They’re turning on a phone.

506
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,640
We must tap that phone.

507
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,840
I want to see the selfie and main cameras.

508
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,880
There, there.

509
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,560
"Hello, darling."

510
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,800
Arturo, darling, how are you?

511
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,480
Fine, fine. I’m fine.

512
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,560
-"It was a clean shot."
-There’s no image.

513
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,560
No selfie or main cameras.
They’ve covered them.

514
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,960
"They’re letting some surgeons in."

515
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,880
I know.

516
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,800
Look, I’ve...

517
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,200
I’ve been thinking about you and...

518
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,200
And everything we did wrong.

519
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,240
Don’t think about it, darling. Not now.

520
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,600
"Not now."

521
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,640
Besides, it’s my fault.

522
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,800
I know we’re not fine.
We haven’t been fine for some time.

523
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,480
I’ve neglected you and our children.
I’ve been selfish.

524
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,120
I promise all that’s going to change,
you hear me?

525
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,440
"I promise that’s going to change.

526
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,600
For 10 years you’ve been
saying you want to see

527
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,040
your sister in Australia."

528
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,760
Take the opportunity so the kids
can learn English.

529
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,240
And see kangaroos.

530
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,720
"That’s the first thing
we’ll do when we go out."

531
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,800
I owe you that.

532
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,640
I’ll do it for you.

533
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,520
Because I love you so much.

534
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,040
All these years wasted, chasing...

535
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,600
Thinking all that mattered
was money and the status and...

536
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,960
"But you’re the only important thing.

537
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,480
It’s always been you."

538
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,880
Since the day I met you.

539
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,320
I swear there are times when...

540
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,600
I try to remember that day...

541
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,200
"And I wonder
what the hell you saw in me, Mónica."

542
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,200
Laura.

543
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,440
You just think about getting out of there.

544
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,440
"Just think about that.

545
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,200
I love you."

546
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,160
I love you, honey.

547
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,040
Are you okay?

548
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,000
Calm down.

549
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,040
You’re really experienced, Arturo.

550
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,640
Your secretary... with the belly...

551
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,560
Laurita waiting for you
in the 4x4 with the children.

552
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,880
You, surrounded by money, are a legend.

553
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,760
Berlin!

554
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,560
The doctors are outside!

555
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,960
You must excuse me.

556
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,480
-Do they all know what they have to do?
-They do! Of course they do!

557
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,920
Are you ready?

558
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,200
Well, they’re ready.

559
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,360
Mercedes!

560
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,320
Are you ready?

561
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,480
-Yes, sir.
-I want her out of here.

562
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,040
Rio, take her to an office.

563
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,280
Nairobi.

564
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,000
Put on your masks!

565
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,160
And with me! Rock and roll!

566
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,240
Come in.

567
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,840
Leave everything on the floor.

568
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,120
Close the door.

569
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,160
Move forward.

570
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,080
Your hands on your head and legs apart.

571
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,320
We’re frisking you.

572
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,400
Get him out of here, please.

573
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,440
"Listen to me."

574
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,520
One of the nurses is an undercover cop.

575
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,680
-Which one?
-"The one with glasses.

576
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,520
You know what you have to do."

577
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,640
-Perfectly. Let’s get to it.
-Berlin!

578
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,280
It has to be a fucking precision work.

579
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,760
I know.

580
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,080
People!

581
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,200
The one with glasses is the cop.

582
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,000
They’ll come in.

583
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,320
Maybe during an assault,
during an emergency...

584
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,800
It could be the Red Cross guy
or the pizza guy,

585
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,480
but it’s obvious they’ll try
to infiltrate someone.

586
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,760
And that will be our chance
to try and give them a Trojan horse.

587
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,440
Do you know what that is?

588
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,120
-I don’t know, but it rhymes easily.
-No!

589
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,400
-The Trojan horse...
-Was pretty hoarse!

590
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,240
Shut up and focus, Jesus!

591
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,360
Sorry.

592
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,600
I’m sorry.

593
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,440
The Greeks were at war with the Trojans.

594
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,280
One day the Trojans found
in front of their city

595
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,960
a wooden horse, a huge wooden horse!

596
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,440
And, out of vanity,

597
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,680
they thought it was a surrender present
by the Greeks.

598
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,240
So they opened the gates...

599
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,200
and they put it inside.

600
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,320
But they didn’t know that horse was hollow

601
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,560
and full of Greek warriors.

602
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,680
That night the Trojans lost the war.

603
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,280
And that’s exactly
what we are going to do.

604
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,560
When they try to get in

605
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,120
thinking they’re winning the battle...

606
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,360
Leave all your metallic objects
on that tray.

607
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,560
Glasses.

608
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,840
Watches.

609
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,520
If you have weapons,

610
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,400
microphones... I also advise you
to let them there.

611
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,960
We’re going to track
any type of radiofrequency.

612
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,440
Take off your shoes too. Please.

613
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,280
And now lie down.

614
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,800
On the ground.

615
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:37,960
Very well.

616
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,200
Like cockroaches.

617
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,280
Stand up.

618
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,680
Put on your shoes.

619
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,360
Take only the glasses.

620
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,960
You’re going to need them.

621
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,800
"Now yes... Welcome.
Take your things and come with me.

622
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,960
Thanks."
