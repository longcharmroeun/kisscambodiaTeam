1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,360
Where is the surgical instruments kit
that the professor gave us?

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,440
-There is a scalpel over there.
-Berlin has got it.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,600
The surgeons! Go and steal
the instruments from them. Hurry!

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,520
-Okay.
-Wait! Wait!

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,520
Give him the note, please.

6
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,520
SATURDAY
06:31 PM

7
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,800
33 HOURS INTO THE ROBBERY

8
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,720
What?

9
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,600
Sometimes on TV there are people like you.

10
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,760
Like me, like what?

11
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,560
Robbers.

12
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,520
But you don't look like one.
I can tell this isn't your thing.

13
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,800
Why?

14
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,120
The way you hold the rifle.

15
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,000
I thought you were the ambassador's
daughter, and not Rambo.

16
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,560
Well, my father always wanted
to have a son

17
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,920
and since I was five years old
he’s been taking me shooting.

18
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,400
Shooting? What at?

19
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,560
At sticks in the funfair?

20
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,920
At wild hogs, red deer,

21
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,360
antelopes...

22
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,720
But what my father would like
is to hunt ecologists.

23
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,400
But I don't like guns.

24
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,600
Once, in Norwich...

25
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,960
the rifle of my father's friend went off.

26
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,200
I saw everything.

27
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,760
The shot in his back,
the people screaming...

28
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,080
It's like...

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,120
when you see an accident on the road
and it gets stuck in your head, the...

30
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,400
blood stain.

31
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,840
Anyway...

32
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,160
It's not loaded, okay?

33
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,080
Don't be scared.

34
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,200
What do you think, doctor?

35
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,320
Will I make it?

36
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,720
The bullet is located...

37
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,480
in the clavicle.

38
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,720
It's not touching any vital organs

39
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,000
and I can't see any...

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,120
bone fragments.

41
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,320
No one is going to die from this.

42
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
Let's get going.

43
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,040
"Denver had no time for diagnoses."

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,120
-Anaesthesia.
-"Mónica was losing a lot of blood.

45
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,760
If he didn't take the scalpels soon,

46
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,720
having spared her life would be in vain."

47
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,400
What kind of anaesthesia will you use?

48
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,000
In this cases like this it's better
to use total sedation.

49
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,120
No.

50
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,720
Better to use local anaesthesia.

51
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,800
So my friend and I can chat
during the surgery, can't we, Arturito?

52
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,720
Relax, relax.

53
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,960
Okay, okay, that's it.

54
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,320
And that clock, what's it for?

55
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,040
To control the duration
of the local anaesthesia, 25 minutes.

56
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,280
If anything should go wrong
during the surgery,

57
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,080
we should give him one more dose.

58
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,400
Show the clock on the screen.

59
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,280
"That operation was scheduled

60
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,600
and had to last exactly 25 minutes
as the inspector had ordered.

61
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,840
That countdown would allow two
police officers wearing face masks of Dali

62
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,360
inside the factory

63
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,760
or, if it went wrong, two dead bodies
inside the ventilation ducts."

64
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,800
Drop the fucking rifle.

65
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,240
It's not loaded,
drop it before I get really pissed off.

66
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,880
The bullet in the breech.

67
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,000
Suárez, do you read me?

68
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,240
Duct clear.

69
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,120
"We're moving towards the target."

70
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,880
Turn around
and put your hands behind your head.

71
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,520
Now!

72
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,400
Now!

73
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,040
So.

74
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,440
What now? Not so tough now, are you?

75
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,800
Move, for fuck's sake, move!

76
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,560
Shoot now.

77
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,080
You fucking crazy little girl.
On your knees!

78
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,320
Scalpel.

79
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,320
Stop, stop, stop.
It’s me who gives the arms out here.

80
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,000
Scalpel.

81
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,080
You nailed it earlier on,
didn't you, Arturo?

82
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,960
Changing your wife's name.

83
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,960
Of course, it's normal.

84
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,000
Fornicating in the mornings with Mónica,

85
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,960
spending the afternoons with Laura...

86
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,840
It's normal to get confused.

87
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,600
But I love them both.

88
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,320
That’s the truth.

89
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,320
When you're in my situation,
it's very easy to judge. Everyone...

90
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,520
thinks you're a scoundrel,

91
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,920
a son of a bitch.

92
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,240
Far be it from me,
to make moral judgments.

93
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,760
I can understand everything.

94
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,680
You can talk freely
about anything with me.

95
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,640
But, in fact I’m a wretch,

96
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,160
a poor man who is in love with two women

97
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,840
and who hasn't got the guts,
to choose one of them.

98
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,240
“And in the middle
of that infidelity declaration,

99
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,080
Denver got the scalpel he needed,

100
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,800
and the love note Mónica
had thrown into the sea was lost

101
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,280
or almost because Nairobi,

102
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,520
always paying close attention
to any detail, spotted it."

103
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,200
-What the fuck did you do that for?
-I don't know, I'm sorry.

104
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,920
I'm sorry.

105
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,280
To the ground!

106
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,880
-You're 11 metres from the entrance.
-"Copy that."

107
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,400
We're proceeding.

108
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,880
Fucking little spoiled brat!

109
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,040
-I'm sorry.
-Shut the fuck up!

110
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,640
Don't tell me your life story, okay?

111
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,120
I'm not the fucking friend
of the outcast, understood?

112
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,160
If you go around begging for
your kidnapper's friendship,

113
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,360
you're so screwed.

114
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,320
Do you know what...?

115
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,040
I'm only six weeks pregnant and...

116
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,200
I'm more concerned
about the kid's life than my own?

117
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,760
You need more than an infection

118
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,000
to stop children
from taking on the world, my dear.

119
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,560
Listen, what's your name?

120
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,560
Moscow, they call me Moscow.

121
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,800
Listen, Moscow,

122
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,440
and what's it like...

123
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,400
being...?

124
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,520
I mean, being a parent.

125
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Being a parent...

126
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,720
You see, being a parent means that
all of a sudden a pile of problems

127
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,480
falls right on your shoulders
and also for the rest of your life.

128
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,360
In a few words,
being worried for the rest of your life.

129
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,240
First, it's the baby's colds.

130
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,240
That means you'll be
in the emergency room every weekend

131
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,880
instead of going for a drink.

132
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,920
I don't mind, I don't drink.

133
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,120
You don’t know what you’re missing,
you don't know how good a Pacharán feels

134
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,800
when you leave him
there sleeping like an angel in his cot.

135
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,960
And then there's school.

136
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,760
The fear...

137
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,080
that all parents feel of...

138
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,800
your son being the dummy
and the punching bag in his class.

139
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,680
I mean, what’s known as "bullying" now.

140
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,720
The fact is that in my case...

141
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,080
it was my son who did the beating.

142
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,600
He was being expelled all the time.

143
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,400
I can’t tell how many schools
he went to, that...

144
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,480
And then his mum, poor her,
she had her bad habits...

145
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,880
Well, not that poor?

146
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,000
She dumped me there, on my own...

147
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,720
Soldiering.

148
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,840
Because in the end, all you want is...

149
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,200
him to be normal,

150
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,960
him not to end up
on a corner, smoking joints

151
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,560
instead of going to school.

152
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,040
But being a parent...

153
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,120
is good. It's very...

154
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,760
Hey, no, no! Mónica, stay with me!

155
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,720
Look at me, look at me!
Stay with me, darling.

156
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,000
-Come on, look at me!
-Dad!

157
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,040
-That's it.
-What's wrong?

158
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,520
-What's wrong?
-Nothing, it's okay.

159
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,400
-Yes?
-Her temperature is too high.

160
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,080
No, don't stop looking at me.
Let's see, look at me, that's it.

161
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,640
I've got everything with me.

162
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,840
"Five minutes left
for the doctors to come out."

163
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,760
Copy that.

164
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,800
It’s out.

165
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,240
Thanks.

166
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,800
And now you stitch him up.

167
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,920
Who, me?

168
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,520
Yes, you.

169
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,160
You're a nurse, aren't you?

170
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,400
-Yes, I am.
-So, then.

171
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,120
It's local anaesthesia.

172
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,680
We put it on the wound
and in a jiffy... no pain.

173
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,760
Yes.

174
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,240
Come on, allow me, I'll do it.

175
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,240
-You keep checking her pulse.
-Right.

176
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,440
There we go...
Done, now, that’s it, that’s it.

177
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,880
Do you know what I'm going to do
when... I get out of here?

178
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,560
I'm going to study long-distance.

179
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,080
You haven't studied in your whole life.

180
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,120
I'm not saying that I'll study medicine,
but I'll...

181
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,440
take it up where I left it, you know?

182
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,760
This is going to hurt a little more, okay?

183
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,840
Look, look. Oh!

184
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,720
Done.

185
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,480
Right, done.

186
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,800
-Ready.
-Ready.

187
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,000
Now, in five minutes
it'll start working and...

188
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,680
we'll start to open up, okay?

189
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,080
-Come on.
-Ready.

190
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,160
-You're within two metres of the entrance.
-We can visualize the target.

191
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,680
Let's see...

192
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,960
I'm not feeling well.
I think I'm going to be sick.

193
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,800
Are you a nurse, a ballet dancer?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

194
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,960
I'm a nurse,

195
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,880
but I'm not used to working
surrounded by guns.

196
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,240
Right, that's enough. I'll stitch him up.

197
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,680
But I want everyone to remain silent
please.

198
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,360
Come on, start.

199
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,480
Tweezers.

200
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,480
The Professor wants to speak to you.

201
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,200
All right. Take the nurse
to the toilet so he can vomit.

202
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,880
If he doesn't, put his head
inside the loo until he does it.

203
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,360
Do you hear me? Until he does.

204
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,960
Good bye, Arturo.

205
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Come on.

206
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,400
Walk.

207
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,480
Walk.

208
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,280
They're broadcasting on short wave
and it's encrypted, so they're getting in,

209
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,880
-but I don't know from where.
-Copy, I’m moving to plan B.

210
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,240
"Okay and get the medical team
out of there right now."

211
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,520
Now.

212
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,560
"My darling, be strong. I'm fine.
I love you. Mónica."

213
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,360
"Sub-inspector Ángel knew
in less than a second

214
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,080
that they had lost another battle.

215
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,560
Those sinister masks
meant that they’re going to throw

216
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,120
two men in at the deep end.

217
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,600
Also that the guy
who had planned that robbery

218
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,640
was smarter
and had more imagination than the police,

219
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,280
the CNI and the Intervention Unit,

220
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,120
and when they're well ahead of you,

221
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,560
it's time to run."

222
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,360
We have to leave now.

223
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,520
Miss, excuse me, we're done here.
Can we go now, please?

224
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,280
-Yes.
-Yes?

225
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,440
Calmly.

226
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,800
You, follow me.

227
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,960
Doctor, doctor!

228
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,280
Just one moment.

229
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,960
One minute, 30 seconds.

230
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,320
-What's wrong?
-They have frequency inhibitors.

231
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,840
Suárez, do you copy?

232
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,800
They've installed frequency inhibitors.

233
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,720
I think communication will be lost.

234
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,760
"Do you read me?"

235
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,000
There are frequency inhibitors.
We're losing communication.

236
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,040
Suárez.

237
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,120
How did the surgery go?

238
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,200
Well, but we should come back in 24 hours.

239
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,120
Thank you for your interest,
but, for the post-op

240
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,880
we have enough qualified people.

241
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,240
My friend, the nurse...
Are you feeling better now?

242
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,280
-Yes, yes, thanks.
-I'm glad to hear.

243
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,520
Excuse me if I can't see you off,
but I leave you in good hands.

244
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,840
Good bye.

245
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,360
-Good bye.
-Good bye.

246
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,720
Give our regards to the people outside!

247
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,480
-Did you tell Arturo that I'm fine?
-Sorry?

248
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,960
Did you tell Arturo that I'm alive?

249
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,400
-Yes. No... I didn't tell him.
-Did you or you didn’t?

250
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,800
I gave him the note.

251
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,960
And what did he say?

252
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,520
Damn, he was overjoyed. He was overjoyed,
what was he supposed to say?

253
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,480
-That...
-Go on.

254
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,440
That...

255
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,640
-That he loves you very much.
-What else?

256
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,400
He said that...

257
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,480
That when you two get out of here,
he's going to take you to Australia.

258
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,240
To Australia?

259
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,520
Yes.

260
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,080
I can't see it.

261
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,200
He also told me that he doesn't know
what you saw in him to like him.

262
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,640
-To Australia?
-Yes, Australia.

263
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,640
It's his wife's dream destination.

264
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,080
Besides, Arturo knows
I'm scared of flying.

265
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,760
What happened?
His wife went in with the doctors?

266
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,160
-Has Laura been here?
-No.

267
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,720
-Yes.
-He told her on the phone.

268
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,400
-Suárez!
-Command post, do you read me?

269
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,200
Command post, do you read me?

270
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,240
Shit.

271
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,920
Inspector, the surgeons are coming out.

272
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,400
Don't stop.

273
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,600
Don't stop.

274
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,560
Run, run now. Run now. Run now! Hurry!

275
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,080
"Come on, out!"

276
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,200
Ángel is running in.
Something’s gone wrong.

277
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,440
Cancel! They've changed their face masks.

278
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,920
They're not wearing the Dali ones.
They're going straight to their slaughter.

279
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,920
What?

280
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,760
Listen up, do not go in.

281
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,520
Suárez, do you read me?

282
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,360
Target reached.

283
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,200
We're proceeding to remove the flap
and we'll be in.

284
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,240
What are you doing?

285
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,720
A bullet.

286
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,480
A bullet wound.

287
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,840
Gosh! Gosh! Gosh, Moscow!
It’s a real bloodbath!

288
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,040
-Move away, let me do it!
-"Then something unexpected happened.

289
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,800
Nairobi did her best and used
her meticulousness for the greater good.

290
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,080
Instead of telling on them,
she helped Moscow save Mónica's life."

291
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,640
I'm going to get some fresh air.

292
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,480
-"Or at least her leg."
-For fuck's sake!

293
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,600
"She really hadn't come to kill anyone."

294
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,880
-Damn, come on!
-"And as I told you before,

295
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,720
she wasn't going to let anything
screw the Professor's plan up."

296
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,440
Suárez, do you read me?

297
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,960
They have changed the face masks.

298
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,320
There are some interferences. Command
post, do you copy me? I can't hear you.

299
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,280
They're not wearing the Dali face masks!
It's a fucking suicide.

300
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,760
Do not go in, I repeat, do not go in!

301
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,120
"It's an order!"

302
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,240
"They have changed their masks.
They're not wearing the Dali face masks.

303
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,520
Attention, do you read me?

304
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,120
"Do not go in!"

305
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,400
-"We're cancelling the operation."
-Damn!

306
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,320
We're cancelling the operation.

307
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,880
Berlin, everyone can relax now.

308
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,080
Plan B has worked as planned.
They're withdrawing.

309
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,760
"Hidden behind a metallic voice
with their cameras and their strategy

310
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,320
negotiating a robbery,
the Professor was in his element."

311
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,480
At the rest of things in life
he was completely useless.

312
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,440
Both so different
like Clark Kent and Superman.

313
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,920
Perhaps because he had spent
his childhood and youth

314
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,800
lying on a bed at San Juan de Dios
hospital of San Sebastián

315
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,120
talking just with senior nurses
and reading books.

316
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,360
He was neither a ordinary
nor a very sociable fellow.

317
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,720
And not the least the seducer type."

318
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,160
Can I sit down?

319
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,240
Yes, sure.

320
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,760
"So I loved making him feel nervous."

321
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,160
So, when you're not planning a heist,
what do you do?

322
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,160
You mean in my spare time
or something like that?

323
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,800
Do you go dancing or...?

324
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,640
No, no, not at all. I don't have
the slightest sense of rhythm.

325
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,600
Have you got a girlfriend?

326
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
Married?

327
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,640
We agreed on no personal information.

328
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,760
You're not a virgin, are you?

329
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,920
I've been in some relationships.

330
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,600
Several.

331
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,000
Not a whole lot and they didn't last long,
but I've had a few.

332
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,640
Relationships... I mean...

333
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,640
sporadic relations.

334
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,520
Sporadic ones, I don't mean
with prostitutes, don't misunderstand me.

335
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,640
Well, I don't know, you may be gay.

336
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,160
For God's sake... No.

337
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,160
No, it just hasn't happened.

338
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,400
I'm not inside any closet
or anything of that sort.

339
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,560
People find a lot of things sexy.

340
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,520
Dancing, muscles, fair hair,

341
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,960
a French accent...

342
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,840
Do you know what I find sexy?

343
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,440
Intelligence.

344
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,960
Men who speak to you
and you can't help admiring them.

345
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,440
It doesn't matter whether they are tall,
short, ugly, good-looking...

346
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,320
It turns me on that they talk to me
about things I don't know.

347
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,240
Well, it's a peculiarity,
it's registered in dictionaries,

348
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,840
it's called sapiophilia.

349
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,360
You know everything, don't you?

350
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,320
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to see the blast off.

351
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,040
One thing.

352
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,600
How did you come up
with the idea of this heist?

353
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,080
It wasn't me who had the idea.

354
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
And who did?

355
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,400
It wasn't me.

356
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,440
That sapiophilia thing
sounds to me like fucking a toad.

357
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,280
-Who the fuck were those face masks of?
-I don't know.

358
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,760
Their mouth was open kind of,
as in distress.

359
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,680
Like, I can't say,
"The Scream" from Munch. That one.

360
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,440
Munch, the Expressionist painter!

361
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,600
Dali, Munch... Which will be the next one?

362
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,080
You don't know how happy it makes me
that you ask that question, inspector.

363
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,400
If you had to change it,
which painter would you choose?

364
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,080
Sorry... I don't know, Picasso, perhaps?

365
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,680
-Goya.
-Goya.

366
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,000
Velázquez.

367
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,280
Velázquez...

368
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,920
Da Vinci. Yes, with a beard.

369
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,120
-I like it, a beard.
-Andy Warhol.

370
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,520
-The soup guy?
-Andy Warhol? Ángel.

371
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,000
Yes, Andy Warhol,
the one who painted Marilyn.

372
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,120
He's a painter...

373
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,960
a very well-known, iconic painter.

374
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,320
The hair and the glasses.

375
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,120
Ángel, you're full of surprises.

376
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,960
Full of surprises
with a microphone in your glasses.

377
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,920
They could change the face masks every day
for a month

378
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,200
and we wouldn't be able
to ever be ahead of them.

379
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:10,040
But that's not the crux of the matter,
inspector, and you know it.

380
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,240
"But that's not important, otherwise..."

381
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,560
How the fuck did they know
we were inside?

382
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,280
How long did they spend studying
all our next steps each second?

383
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,720
If I'm honest with you, half of my life.

384
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,080
How long do they expect
to be inside there?

385
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,080
Not long, only 9 more days.
10, 11 the longest.

386
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,680
We're playing a fucking game of chess,

387
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,880
"and they're beating us."

388
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,560
But I have a Trojan horse, inspector.
You have little chance to beat me.

389
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,680
It's time to think carefully...

390
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,960
look back,

391
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,440
go back to the starting point.

392
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,240
We all know this started long time ago.

393
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,160
We know that those who were inside
had been there before.

394
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,280
We have footage of Cortés
and Oliveira entering the museum.

395
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,080
"But did they enter alone?

396
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,920
Was it the first time or the last one?

397
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,360
How many times did they visit it?"

398
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,320
Did they speak to anyone?
A sign, a look...

399
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,160
and, more important, did they
leave any fucking string to pull?

400
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,760
"I want you to go through
the CCTV footage again

401
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,200
and check them second by second."

402
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,440
The rest of us will try to rest.

403
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,200
Some of you haven't slept
for over 30 hours.

404
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,160
Suárez, give me a call
if anything happens.

405
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,320
You're in command.

406
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,080
"Affray in Marcelo Usera, any unit near?"

407
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,120
Please,

408
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,360
leave channel eight free
for the hostages crisis!

409
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,920
"No one uses channel eight, thank you!"

410
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,600
Listen, Raquel.
Fancy a bite before going home?

411
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,040
Between eating and sleeping,
I'd choose the former, but...

412
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,480
I'm worn out, Ángel.

413
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,200
I’m sorry, thanks.

414
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,760
"Have you ever thought
that if you could go back in time

415
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,680
you probably wouldn't make
the same decisions?

416
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,760
And that we all make our own snowballs
with our bad decisions,

417
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,200
snowballs that get bigger and bigger,
like the rock in Indiana Jones,

418
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,680
and slide down after you to squash you.

419
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,640
All the decisions we made in the past

420
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,560
they take us inexorably to our future.

421
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,720
Rio was going to realize
that as soon as he switched on

422
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,320
the only television set
there was left in the factory,

423
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,480
in case at any point we lost
communication with the professor."

424
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,240
Turn it on, kid!
Turn it on, see what they say about us.

425
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,080
This, bigger
than Glasgow Great train robbery!

426
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,520
"A yet unknown number
of robbers gained access...

427
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,760
What do the robbers want?"

428
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,520
This is a big one!

429
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,680
"Do they want to hit the system?"

430
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,760
My goodness!
Not even the Americans could have done it!

431
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,840
This is made in Spain but with M-16!
Beat it!

432
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,680
Gosh, my parents!

433
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,760
"An adolescent... a bit of a weirdo...

434
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,160
"Shy...
-Shy.

435
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,560
Our son was always locked in his room,

436
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,320
but we thought he was
playing computer games or...

437
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,840
But one never thinks
that he is a criminal.

438
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,800
And then... you see him on TV
with a rifle, shooting,

439
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,840
with 60 people all locked up.

440
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,960
-And you see he's like those jihadists.
-Paco...

441
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,720
He isn't our son anymore.

442
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,000
Please, don't say that.

443
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,280
For me... For me it's like he was dead.

444
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,800
But, Paco...

445
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,200
We have just heard the words
of one of the parents, heartbroken..."

446
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,360
The professor said no news from outside.

447
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,920
"But he had also said
he wanted a robbery with no violence,

448
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,720
with no victims."

449
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,560
Ángel, yes.

450
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,040
"Hello, Raquel.

451
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,160
Were you sleeping?"

452
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,480
No, no, no, what's the matter?

453
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,840
No, no, no, no. Nothing, relax.

454
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,520
Look, I’ve been thinking.
Have you got a minute?

455
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Give her a rest, man,
she must be worn out.

456
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,120
Yes, sure, yes.

457
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,080
Sorry to be so direct:
what was all that about Andy Warhol?

458
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,440
-Sorry?
-"That, about being full of surprises."

459
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,800
What's wrong with me, I'm not supposed
to like museums or modern painters?

460
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,640
I'm not supposed
to like something other than the Atleti?

461
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,440
Yes, of course you are.

462
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,800
It took me by... surprise,
because I didn't know.

463
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,240
"The same way I didn't know
you were an Atleti supporter".

464
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,280
-But it suits me, doesn't it?
-Yes, it does.

465
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,680
Yes, it does.

466
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,640
Listen, Ángel, I'm really tired.
Can we speak tomorrow?

467
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,920
The guy I saw you with,
you were holding hands.

468
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,040
Would you sleep with him?

469
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,480
-"Tell me, I want to know."
-Ángel, what's all this about now?

470
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,640
Would you sleep with him, yes or no?

471
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,760
Answer me.

472
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,480
Well, yes, I would, why not?

473
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,240
"I'm a free, 40 year-old woman,"

474
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,920
and the truth is
that I could do with a good bang,

475
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,840
to... have something different
to think about.

476
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,120
So I surely would.

477
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,080
And, so what?

478
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,640
I understand.

479
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,480
You would give anyone a chance.
I understand.

480
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,720
Ángel...

481
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,600
What happened between you and me
in Cercedilla was a fling.

482
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,640
"Eight years have passed and, look,"

483
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,840
I made a clean cut
because we're colleagues.

484
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,800
-And friends, Raquel.
-And friends.

485
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,680
-And you're married, Ángel.
-"I'm married."

486
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,320
Because you said
it wouldn't work between colleagues.

487
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,960
"Then you got married,
and on top of that with a colleague."

488
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,080
And because you never see me like...
a winner, you always see me

489
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,240
like the loser who is not...
supposed to like Andy Warhol.

490
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,360
"But if for a moment
you would see me as a man,"

491
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,520
I promise you it would take me
less than ten minutes to leave Carmen...

492
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,360
Forgive me. Raquel, I’m sorry. Damn,
I don't know what I'm saying, anymore.

493
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,200
"It's this... job,
which is driving us mad."

494
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,080
Yes, yes, that's true, all of us.

495
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:30,720
"Ángel, it's late. Go to bed, huh?
We'll talk tomorrow."

496
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,520
-Good night, Raquel.
-"Good night."

497
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,960
Who were you talking to?

498
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,880
I can't believe you were spying on me.

499
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,680
I couldn't help overhear the conversation.

500
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,200
Go to sleep, it's late.

501
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,160
Too late. Now, I can't sleep.

502
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,240
Let's see, tell me, what's wrong now?

503
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,640
-What?
-Two suitors.

504
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,200
He's not a suitor,
it's Ángel, a colleague.

505
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,680
Ah, I thought
you were making him feel jealous

506
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,400
with the stranger in the bar,
the one from the beers.

507
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,960
Please, mum, I wasn't making him jealous!

508
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,000
And you... don't close any doors.

509
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,720
And now that you're not married,
you can go around playing the field.

510
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,640
-Ah, playing the field.
-Yes, playing the field.

511
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,600
Of course.

512
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,360
Kido, in the end love is...

513
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,400
what makes us see life in a different way.

514
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,400
And you lately just see
the dark side of everything.

515
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,080
It may mean that
you haven't got over... all this.

516
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,120
Let's see, mum, let's see,
what haven't I got over, eh?

517
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,280
You also think I pressed false charges...

518
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,000
and I'm bitter because my ex
got involved with my sister

519
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,320
and I want to screw them?

520
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,920
Your husband
got involved with your sister?

521
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,160
Mum, what are you saying?

522
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,840
-What?
-Nothing. Yes...

523
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,720
I just wanted to play it down.

524
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,440
In the end that man
has hooked up with two sisters

525
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,360
like in the films... those erotic ones.

526
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,520
Mum. Mum, are you okay?

527
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,680
How are you getting on with the heist,
darling?

528
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,640
Sorry... Not well, not well. not well.

529
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,360
There, sitting all day,

530
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,640
in a stagnant situation, and... Yes.

531
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,760
But you sitting, my darling?

532
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,480
What you have to do is to chase.

533
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,440
You only catch bad people when
you chase them. As if you didn't know.

534
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,400
Good night, darling.

535
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,000
What a nice surprise!

536
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,800
You should come around more often.

537
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,280
I can see you have
a very cute little office.

538
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,720
-You already have two.
-I like offices.

539
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,920
I have always...

540
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,080
wanted to have one with a mahogany desk,

541
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,000
but crime and offices
don't get along.

542
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,080
It's so hot, isn't it?

543
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,560
I can see you're wearing
your bullet proof vest to come to see me.

544
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,800
I'd have preferred a bustier,
one of those Venetian ones.

545
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,160
You see?

546
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,120
I can't quite make you out.

547
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,960
Why did you come, Tokyo?

548
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,600
To ask you

549
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,640
please

550
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,680
to phone the professor

551
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,400
and tell him what you did,

552
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,360
that you order the execution of a hostage.

553
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,920
Naughty boy.

554
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,680
Because you know what?

555
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,120
The professor is my guardian angel,

556
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,720
and if you don't tell him,
I'll have to do it.

557
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,680
You?

558
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,920
And you'll be a tattletale.

559
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,240
a snitch, a filthy rat.

560
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,520
I'm a gentleman,
I wouldn't allow that to happen.

561
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,840
Yes.

562
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,120
I violated the first rule of the plan.

563
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,920
I’ve killed a hostage.

564
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,440
"Well not exactly me, Denver has,
but that's not important."

565
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,520
Let's say he did it strictly
following my orders.

566
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,160
I preferred to tell you myself.

567
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,680
It was the only red line.

568
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,080
You've screwed everything up.

569
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,120
-I understand your shock.
-"You've screwed everything up."

570
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,320
That woman had a mobile phone
between her legs.

571
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,600
She might have wanted to use it
to phone her cousin Chelito...

572
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,440
and tell her she was shagging the CEO,

573
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,600
but I actually think
she wanted to phone the police.

574
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,600
No more phones in the future.
You can be sure of that.

575
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,600
Who was she?

576
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,880
Mónica Gaztambide.

577
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,760
"Will you punish me?"

578
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,280
You should.

579
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,360
"I know you're an idealist,

580
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,240
that you think they will give us
the banknotes when we say please,"

581
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,440
that you want to be a decent guy,
while you give us guns and explosives

582
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,560
to blow this building up,
but no more games.

583
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,240
You'll have to punish me,

584
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,360
"because if you don't have the guts,
we won't succeed."

585
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,480
I've told you on and on
over the past years:

586
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,240
it's not me who has a problem, it's you.

587
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,720
"You have to punish me because
that way I'll know you are a real captain"

588
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,880
who is at the helm with no doubt,

589
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,280
that you're dependable.

590
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,480
"It seems you don't want
to talk about it now.

591
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,960
For the time being, nobody
outside knows about this demise,

592
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,800
so the plan is on."

593
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,800
They'll ask for proofs of life
in less than 48 hours.
