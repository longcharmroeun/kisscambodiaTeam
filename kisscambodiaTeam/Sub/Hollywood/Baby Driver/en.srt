when you could make all that

you'll be rolling in money,

buying Maseratis and feeding
your gal catfish dipped in gold.

943

You in?

No, don't answer my question
with another question.

946

You give me one of
two replies. Yes or no.

947
00:45:46,116 --> 00:45:48,886
No, Doc.

948
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:52,522
You know I never do a job with the
exact same crew twice, right?

949
00:45:52,655 --> 00:45:54,024
Yes.
And you also know

you've been my driver
for every job since we met.

Yes.

952

So, I'm of the thinking
that you are my lucky charm

953
00:46:04,267 --> 00:46:07,871
and that I'm not doing
this job without you.

954

about what happens
when you say no,

956
00:46:11,041 --> 00:46:12,852
how I could break your legs
and kill everyone you love,

957
00:46:12,876 --> 00:46:14,476

know that, don't you?
