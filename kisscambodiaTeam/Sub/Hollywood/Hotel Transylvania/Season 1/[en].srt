00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,614
Yes, she is!

166
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,448
EUNICE: What's going
on out there?

167
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,121
Are we at the hotel?

168
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:16,291
Frank, did you book us
for a tandem massage?

169
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,539
Did you get us a
table at Hunchback's?

170
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,162
Did you do anything?

171
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,623
You're welcome.

172
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,706
EUNICE:
What's going on?

173
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,463
Dad, you said that

174
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,387
when I turned 118, I could
go out into the world

175
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:32,383
like every other adult that gets
to come and go from this hotel.

176
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,135
"But, Mavey Wavey, it's not safe.
Bleh, bleh-bleh."

177
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,562
Dad, 30 years ago,
you promised.

178
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,477
I remember, we were
both eating mice,

179
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,979
and you specifically said
that you gave me your word.

180
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,568
Do not disturb.

181
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:48,906
Do not disturb.
Do not disturb.

182
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,074
Do not disturb.

183
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,443
Do not disturb.
Do not disturb.

184
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,662
- Do not disturb.
- Good morning, Your Eminence.

185
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,909
Maid, clean up this room!

186
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,747
It's you. Glad you
could make it.

187
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,996
- Is she up yet?
- Oh, she's up.

188
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:06,754
She's ready to go. And by "go," I mean go.
As in, go check the world out.

189
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,756
What you gonna do?
What you gonna say?

190
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:12,256
I got it covered. Please, relax.
Just do your job.

191
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,262
Good morning, Mavey Wavey!

192
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,264
Happy birthday,
my little mouse!

193
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,511
Thank you, Dad.

194
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,268
I know it's my birthday.

195
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,857
I have so much fun planned.
Whoo-hoo!

196
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,776
But first, we go catch
some scorpions together,

197
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,612
just the two of us,
yes, dead-ums?

198
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,777
Dad, please, let me speak.

199
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,525
There's something
we have to talk about.

200
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:34,031
You want to go out
into the world. You can.

201
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,202
Aha!

202
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,621
I knew you were gonna say that.

203
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,536
But, Dad, you gave
me your word,

204
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,118
and you know that I know that
a Dracula's word is sacred.

205
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,794
That our trust is
the core of our...

206
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:43,961
Wait, what?

207
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,459
I said you can go.

208
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,797
You're just playing with me.

209
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,464
No, no, no, no. You're old
enough to drive a hearse now,

210
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,552
you're old enough to
make your own choices.

211
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:52,880
You can go.

212
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,761
Holy rabies!
Holy rabies!

213
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,221
DRACULA:
Whoa, whoa. Stop.

214
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,148
Wait a second, sweetfangs.

215
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,567
Where are you going?

216
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,565
Oh, well, I'm
going to paradise,

217
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,988
and this is just some stuff
that I thought I would need.

218
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,316
- Paradise?
- Yeah, you know.

219
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,992
It's that place out there
where you and Mom met.

220
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,326
Auntie Wanda says you two

221
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,325
were just like, Zing!

222
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,993
I don't know from "Zing."

223
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,912
Where did you find that card?

224
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,493
In one of your drawers.

225
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,419
Why won't you ever tell me
about how you met?

226
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,997
It's actually Hawaii.

227
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,172
Ha-what-what?

228
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,334
Look, honey,
I know you're excited,

229
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:35,009
but everyone has gone to great lengths
to come see you on your birthday.

230
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,599
I know. They always do.

231
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,601
But aren't I getting a little
old for these parties?

232
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:44,432
I love them, but I really
want to see new things.

233
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,608
Maybe meet somebody my age.

234
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,357
Come on. No,
no, don't do that.

235
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,939
Don't give me
the pouty batface.

236
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,359
Okay, there is a human village

237
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,819
just a little ways
past the cemetery.

238
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,997
You could go there and be back
in, like, 30 minutes or so.

239
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,996
It should be plenty
for your first time.

240
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,954
(SIGHS) Well, it's not
Ha-wee-wee, but I guess

241
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,664
it's still technically
out there.

242
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,216
Okay, okay, okay!

243
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:17,763
Thanks for trusting me.

244
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,507
Of course, my little one.

245
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,558
I gave you my word.

246
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,311
Hey, honey!

247
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,980
- Look at this!
- Hey, guys.

248
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,932
You excited about tomorrow?

249
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,650
Not as excited
as I am right now.

250
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,649
You're not gonna believe
this, but Dad is letting me

251
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,480
go out on my own
to see a human village!

252
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:34,610
What?
No!

253
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,779
Excuse me. Drac!

254
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:37,991
Have you lost it?

255
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,660
Letting your own
daughter out there

256
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,239
with those horrible humans
you always tell us about?

257
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,416
That's why you
built this place.

258
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,458
They hate us.
They're vicious.

259
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,374
And they're very loud!

260
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,797
Auntie Eunice, maybe
they've changed.

261
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,541
I'm just gonna fly down the
street and see how it goes.

262
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,501
Okay, honey, be safe.

263
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,462
Bring warm clothes and a sword.

264
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:58,804
And look out for pitchforks.

265
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,140
Don't you let anyone scoop
your brains out, either.

266
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,474
Maybe stay in the shadows.

267
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,890
It's more fun to just
observe from under a house.

268
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,767
Guys, guys.
She can handle it.

269
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,065
She's a Dracula,
for Pete's sake.

270
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,484
But seriously,
watch out for fire.

271
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,444
Fire bad.

272
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,865
Bye, everyone.

273
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,457
Whoo-hoo!

274
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,550
Whoo-hoo!

275
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,763
Drac, I can't believe how calm
you are about her leaving.

276
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,260
I'm proud of you.

277
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,559
Drac? Drac?

278
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,477
Where did Drac go?

279
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,474
MAVIS:
Whoo-hoo!

280
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,561
This is awesome!

281
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,899
There's the cemetery,
just like Dad said.

282
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,204
MAVIS:
Whoo-hoo!

283
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,725
Uh... Hello?

284
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,112
Anybody out there?

285
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,828
Vampire.
Bite toes!

286
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:50,999
Oh!

287
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,702
Hi, humans.

288
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:59,168
Everything okay? My name
is Mavis Dracula, and I...

289
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,502
Vampire.

290
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,303
- Burn clothes.
- MAVIS: Burn my clothes?

291
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,506
- Really? Um...
- Vampire!

292
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:08,139
We take your candy.
Candy!

293
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,595
I'm friendly.
I really am.

294
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,722
- Calm down, now.
- Candy.

295
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,895
I just wanted to say hi.

296
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,897
(GROANING)

297
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,523
(LAUGHING)

298
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,318
Please. I've never
hurt anyone.

299
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,413
I'm homeschooled.

300
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,540
Is that garlic?

301
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:42,631
(GASPS)

302
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,849
Holy rabies, you're on fire.

303
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,806
Can I do anything?
Can I help you?

304
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,441
Dad was right.

305
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,436
Dad was right.

306
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,159
It worked.

307
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:14,409
Now my baby will
be safe forever.

308
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,088
All right, everybody,
get back to work now.

309
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,589
DRACULA: Hey. You don't
need a mannequin.

310
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,639
Leave the mannequin
here. Come on.

311
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,657
(GRUNTING)

312
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,244
Where you been?

313
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,163
Why you sneaking around?

314
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,412
Shh. Quiet.

315
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:59,246
Sweetheart, have you
returned so soon?

316
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,580
Oh. Come in, Dad.

317
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,586
How'd it go?
How was the big world?

318
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,292
How was it out there?

319
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,627
It was okay, Dad.

320
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,303
What? What's the matter?

321
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,130
Dad, you were right.

322
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,681
Humans are awful.

323
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,508
They were everything you said.

324
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,806
- They wanted to bite my toes.

- "Dad"?

484
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:36,164
Yeah, I know, Dracula's daughter.
Everyone freaks out at first.

485
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,415
Dracula?

486
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,586
Okay, we got to go.

487
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,251
Please don't kill me.
I'm so young.

488
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,678
I have so many
places I want to see.

489
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:49,007
I've got tickets to six
Dave Matthews Band concerts.

490
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,966
I'm getting out of here.

491
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,552
(GLEN ROARING)

492
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,638
Shut up already.

493
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:58,270
It's impossible for me
to think with all your noise.

494
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,567
Sorry, Glen.
Go back to sleep.

495
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:06,782
- Wait. Aren't you going to suck my blood?
- Classic human paranoia.

496
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:10,828
Human blood is so fatty, and you
never know where it's been.

497
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,656
So, Dracula doesn't
drink blood?

498
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:16,162
No, I use a blood substitute.

499
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:20,542
Either Near Blood or Blood Beaters.
You can't tell the difference.

500
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:23,465
So, wow, you're, like,
the real Count Dracula.

501
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,293
Like, "I'm Dracula.
Bleh, bleh-bleh."

502
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:30,006
I've never said that in my life.
"Bleh, bleh-bleh."

503
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,807
I don't know where
that comes from.

504
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:35,307
Can I just ask, what
exactly is this place?

505
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,808
What is this place?

506
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:45,733
It's a place I built for all
those monsters out there,

507
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:51,161
lurking in the shadows, hiding
from the persecution of humankind.

508
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,740
A place for them and their families
to come to and be themselves.

509
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:59,243
A place void of torches,
pitchforks, angry mobs.

510
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:02,588
A place of peace, relaxation

511
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,923
and tranquility.

512
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,088
Cool. So, it's like
a hotel for monsters?

513
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:12,052
Yes, exactly. "A hotel for
monsters." Way to sum it up.

514
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:16,557
Okay, hop on my back.
We're leaving.

515
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,262
Oh, man, you're a bat now.

516
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,230
I always wanted to fly.
What's it like?

517
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,434
This is insane. Wait.
Wait, I want to stay.

518
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:26,062
Can Frankenstein sign my costume?
Can I meet the Invisible Man?

519
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,614
Hey, if I stuck my hand
in the Invisible Man's mouth,

520
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,277
- would it disappear?
- MAVIS: Hi.

521
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,245
Mavey! What are you doing,
my sweet little blood orange?

522
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,367
Our friend was just leaving.

523
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,414
Yeah, he was flying
me out the window.

524
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,035
This guy, he's so funny.

525
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:43,587
Look, you have
something on your face.

526
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:47,417
Play along if you ever want
to see your precious backpack.

527
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:54,049
Whoa. So, wait, you didn't have any
clothes on when you were a bat?

528
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,428
Or were they bat-sized?

529
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,635
Who exactly is that?

530
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:59,978
Hmm. Honeybat.

531
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,268
You see, it's your birthday.

532
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:07,148
And you know I want you to have the
bestest, specialest party of your life.

533
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:10,523
So, well, I needed some help.

534
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:11,823
You needed help?

535
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,319
Well, look, I am very good,
but I thought it would be

536
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:20,792
even more bestest, specialest if someone
closer to your age helped plan the party.

537
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,118
- You're my age?
- Sure.

538
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,828
Well, how old are you?

539
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:24,999
118.

540
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,872
One hundred and...
(COUGHS)

541
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,754
Yeah, I'm 121.

542
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,631
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

543
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,465
You see? Everything
is very, very normal.

544
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,300
I'm throwing a party,
and he's helping.

545
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,681
Sir, there's an emergency.
Not now.

546
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:44,352
Can't you see we're in the middle
of something very normal here?

547
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:45,975
Wait, what's going on here?

548
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:50,313
There's an emergency in your precious
hotel, and you're not running to fix it?

549
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:51,981
Why? Is it because of him?

550
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,907
Whoa, look at my face.

551
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:57,995
No, precious bones,
it's not because of him.

552
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,914
Good. Then go check on the emergency,
and I'll keep him company.

553
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,913
- No! Anything but that!
- What?

554
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,711
I mean, because
he needs time to plan.

555
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:09,666
And if you're keeping him
company, then he's not planning.

556
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,546
He is company-keeping,

557
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,003
and then the plan, it's...
it doesn't get planned.

558
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,425
- Mm-hmm. Good one.
- Shut up!

559
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:20,601
Okay. So, maybe if you're not
planning later, we can hang out.

560
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,225
- Sounds good.
- Yes. You hear that?

561
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,055
It sounds good.

562
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:29,185
So you will hang out. See you
later, my honey. Lovely.

563
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,649
Okay, you're not hanging out.

564
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,651
Because you are leaving.

565
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,778
But the opposite, you said.

566
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,121
SUIT OF ARMOR:
But, sir, the emergency.

567
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,743
Follow me.

568
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,379
Boy, that kid smelt.

569
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,835
Where are we going?

570
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,295
Just getting rid of you

571
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:59,131
through a secret tunnel
so she does not see us.

572
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,551
So, can I ask you a question?

573
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,977
Is that real, about
the garlic thing?

574
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,896
Yes, I cannot have it.
My throat swells.

575
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,807
Huh. Wooden stake
to the heart?

576
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,563
Yeah, well, who
wouldn't that kill?

577
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:15,777

578
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,116
Ah. Here we go.

579
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,747
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm a little lost.

580
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,329
Yes, I know it's your honeymoon.
I apologize.

581
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:33,291
Go back to doing
what you were doing.

582

(KISSING)

584
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,213
DRACULA: I'm not
down here much.

585
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:42,891
It's meant to be an exit
if humans ever invade.

586
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:46,766
So, I'm, like, the first human here, huh?
That's really cool.

587
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,268
Oh, boy.

588
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,350
I think this is it.

589
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,021
- What's happening?
- I'm terribly sorry.

590
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:58,524
- My mistake.
- What is wrong with you people?

591
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,491
Oh, man. This
place is amazing.

592
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,198
Okay, I could really use
some silence right now.

593
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,082
All right, third time's a...

00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,308
Yes, Frankie?

596
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:26,681
Hey, buddy, what
you been doing?

597
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,977
Don't move.

598
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,805
Never mind that.
What you been doing?

599
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,812
We wanted to practice our
big number for Mavis's party,

600
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,985
and then these losers wouldn't
get off the bandstand.

601
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,733
Okay. Put down
Zombie Mozart,

602
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,405
Bach and Beethoven
this instant.

603
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,954
Did you get to rehearse
at all, Zombie Beethoven?

604
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,656
(GROANS IN 5TH SYMPHONY)

605
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:51,585
Listen, Drac, we wanted to play
something, like old times.

606
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,083
We even thought maybe
you'd sing with us.

607
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:58,463
Come on, fellas. You know that I
haven't sung in public since Martha.

608
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,795
Yeah, but we just thought how much,
you know, Mavis would love it.

609
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:01,969
I said no!

610
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,171
Don't ask me again!

611
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:06,801
Okay. Now, let's hug the zombies.
Let's all make up.

612
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,432
Wow. He really scared you.
I wasn't scared.

613
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:11,479
I was being polite, okay?

614
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:14,684
Hey. What are you doing here?
I thought you were planning.

615
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,189
I never caught your name.

616
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,361
My name's Mavis.

617
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:21,111
Mavis? That's a
pretty neat name.

618
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,862
Yeah, my mom picked it.

619
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:26,115
So, are you going
to tell me your name?

620
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:30,199
Me? My name?
Good question.

621
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,205
Well, obviously,
I'm Frankenstein.

622
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,833
No, you're not. Frankenstein
is my uncle over there.

623
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,084
The gentleman hugging
Zombie Mozart.

624
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,584
Right. Of course,
he's your uncle.

625
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,804
Well, see, I'm not
"the" Frankenstein.

626
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:47,509
I'm his cousin, Johnnystein.

627
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,184
- Johnnystein?
- Hey, Mavis.

Are these monsters
going to kill me?

Not as long as they think
you're a monster.

632
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,524
Huh? That's kind of racist.

633
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,072
We'll talk later.

(GROANING)

635
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,073
- Is he making fun of me?
- No, no.

00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,281
Of course he's not,
because he's...

He's your cousin, Johnnystein.

638
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,867
Yes, yes, yes.

639
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,202
I don't have no cousin.

640
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:18,289
No, no, you do. He's your sixth
cousin, three times removed.

641
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,415
On your right arm's side.

642
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:21,671
You have a cousin?

643
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,047
DRACULA: Frank,
if your arm could talk,

644
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:26,175
he would tell you that the original
owner of your arm had a brother.

645
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,551
Who married a woman.

646
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,725
Who was... (GAGS)
For strangling a pig.

647
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,268
I have pig-strangling
blood in my arm?

648
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,436
That's kind of cool.

649
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,435
Well, cuz, great to meet you.

650
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,109
So, what brings
you here, Johnny?

651
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,561
Wah! What was that?
Oh, sorry.

652
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:42,738
I should really clear my
throat before I speak.

653
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,610
Anyway, what brings you here?

654
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,906
Oh. Uh.

655
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,450
Party planner.

656
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:52,908
Yes, I have recruited Mr. Stein here to
help me with Mavis's birthday party.

657
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,959
Wait a minute, you asked
someone to help you?

658
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,251
Captain Control Freak?

659
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:58,419
It's Count...

660
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:02,545
And yes, I thought having a Mavis
contemporary would be useful.

661
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,969
Yeah, he totally needed
a fresher perspective.

662
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,673
Okay, Johnny, Mr. Tight
Coffin over here

663
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,471
was planning to have these powdered
lame-os play at the party.

664
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,263
So, anyways, we thought we
could liven things up a bit.

Yeah! Maybe he can find
a way to get me some chicks.

We should do a dance contest!

We're not doing any of that.

We've got to stay
on schedule, all right?

May I make you an omelet?

No, no, no, no.
I'm not hungry.

I am hungry.

Johnny, you've been
to the Taj Mahal?

734
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,389
Come on. No monster's
been to the Taj.

735
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,967
Man, I wish I could go there.

736

You know what?
I'll take 50 omelets.

You heard the man!
Make them!

738
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:30,479
How did you deal with the mobs?

739
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,811
Yeah, it does get pretty
crazy in the summer.

740
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,646
But, you know,
you just got to roll.

He just rolls. That's
cool that he rolls.

Yes, yes, cool.

Oh, cool.

Yes, of course you are.

00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:57,044
Johnny, can we party-plan
talk for a minute?

750

What are you doing?

If they find out you are
human, they'll go bat poop!

Relax. No one
suspects anything.

753
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:05,643
The only thing that looks weird is
how much whispering you're doing.

754
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,982
Just wrap it up. You will say you are
going in the pool and act excited.

755
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,527
And then you will say you hurt
your back and you have to leave.

No, no. He said,
"Oh, my back."

Get on my back!

796
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,419
Boy, the wrong people
get to be immortal.

797
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,213
Look at me.

798
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:43,794
You remember nothing
of this encounter.

799
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:49,554
You have no memory of this
place or the monsters you met.

800
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,852
Now go and never return.

801
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,390
Wait, never return
to the hotel?

802
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,691
What? You were supposed
to forget the hotel.

803
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,985
I just used my powers
to erase your memory.

804
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,653
I looked straight
into your eyes.

805
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:04,652
Huh. Oh, maybe it's
the contact lenses.

806
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,820
- The what?
- These little plasticky doodads

807
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,033
that help me see better.

808
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,157
Here, let me just try
and get them out real quick.

809
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,955
Oh, that is the most disgusting
thing I've ever seen!

810
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,996
- Almost got it.
- Stop doing that. Please stop doing that!

811
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,669
Fingers away from
the eyeballs! Enough!

812
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:23,625
Listen to me. You are
never to return here.

813
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:27,588
You are to stay away and never
tell humans about this place.

814
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:32,221
Or I will track you down
and suck every ounce of blood

815
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,806
from your body until you look
like a deflated whoopee cushion!

816
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,808
Be gone.

817
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,446
Can't believe I'm leaving, man.
That could have been so great!

818
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:52,495
Dude ruined everything.
Suck my blood.

819
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,289
I should have just said,
"I'm staying, old man!"

820
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:58,459
Give him a Bruce Lee kick.
Boom! Right in the...

821
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:01,913
Oh, my God. Count Dracula. Please don't
kill me. I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

822
00:43:04,744 --> 00:43:05,744
Follow me.

823
00:43:05,768 --> 00:43:09,244
Oh. No, no, Mavis, I can't.
I have to leave.

824
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,764
- You sure? It'll be fun.
- Okay.

825
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,526
He's not gonna see me, is he?

826
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,236
Whoa.

827
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:42,086
Wow, would you look at
the view from up here?

828
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,797
- You could almost see Budapest.
- Who-da-pest?

829
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,795
Is that near Ha-wi-fi?

830
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,674
Huh? Oh, you mean Hawaii. Yeah,
that place is a knockout.

831
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,755
I just went to a
music festival there.

832
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,716
A human music festival?

833
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,472
Uh, I believe so.

834
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:59,641
So, did they all bite your toes and
shove garlic bread in your face?

835
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,722
No. Well, one dude
took a bigger bite

836
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:03,395
out of my energy bar
than I expected,

837
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,896
but I blame that on the heat.

838
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,645
It's amazing.
You've been everywhere.

839
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,822
Well, you know,
what's the alternative?

840
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:13,492
Just staying at home, never exploring,
never seeing what's out there?

841
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:18,699
I'm only gonna be 121 once, right?
Got to live it.

842
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,247
Yeah.

843
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:27,917
Oh, man. The sunrise from
here must be amaz... Ow.

844
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,417
Oh, I'm sorry.

845
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,590
Man, you've probably never
even seen a sunrise, have you?

846
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,763
No, not really. Why?

847
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:35,260
Come on. I have an idea.

848
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:39,431
Watch.

849
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,453
Ahh.
Ahh.

850
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:10,463
Didn't I tell you guys we'd have
fun in here? Is this not the best?

851
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,423
Yeah, I'm working up
a nice sweat.

852
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,678
When's that Johnny kid gonna
be done party planning?

853
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,847
- He's a great hang.
- Yeah, he's an animal.

854
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,892
And it was so nice seeing Mavis
laughing and hitting it off with him.

855
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,599
Who's hitting
what off? Please.

856
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:30,107
Mavis could never be
with someone of his kind.

857
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:33,531
I'm sorry?
"His kind"?

858
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:35,901
You're saying our kind's
not good enough for you,

859
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,576
"Your Lordship"?

860
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:39,404
No, no, no!
Frank, I didn't...

861
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:44,414
I meant that she wouldn't be into
someone with such red, curly hair.

862
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:46,836
Uh, what's wrong
with red, curly hair?

863
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:48,205
Why are you getting upset?

864
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:50,206
I have red curly hair!

865
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:52,333
Well, how was I
supposed to know that?

866
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:10,819
This is the most incredible
thing I've ever seen.

867
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,321
Johnny?

868
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:15,740
Look, settle down, fellas.

869
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,905
This is all a moot point
because Johnny, he left.

870
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,243
Wait a minute. He left?

871
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:23,661
Yes. He decided he didn't
like Mavis, or any of us.

872
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,873
Hi.

873
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:29,555
Hmm. I guess Johnny
had second thoughts.

874
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:43,889
I can't believe you stuck around, man.
You don't get it.

Bad things are coming your way.

876
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:49,266
I got to get my
thoughts together.

877
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:50,733
Okay.

878
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,227
You see these tables?

879
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:55,070
You can spend the entire
day pulling them out

880
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,189
and placing them,
party planner.

881
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,241
Fantastic.
I'm trapped here.

know where Johnny went?

- Why do you want to know?
- Oh! Uh...

- Do you like him?
- What?

Pfft, no. Come on, Dad.

I've seen that picture at the ruins
of Lubov. That's my favorite castle.

1001
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:31,481
There's a whole legend
around that lady.

A legend?

The Lady Lubov.

The story is that
a lonely count

<i>met her by chance, and
they say that no two souls</i>

for each other.</i>

<i>Eventually, they settled down at
Castle Lubov and had a child.</i>

tragedy happened.</i>

<i>A fire started mysteriously one
night, and it killed both of them.</i>

1010
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:03,434
When I was at the castle, I could
still feel their powerful love.

1011
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:08,060
They say it's as if a soul is still
trapped in the ruins themselves.

The legend is wrong.

Let's go.

best way to the airport?

Yes, fellow Dracula. There's only one way.
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

1275
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:39,026
But it's all blocked.
We'll never make it in time.

1276
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:41,858
You should have left an hour earlier.
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

All right, let's just run
through it on foot.

Drac, this'll protect you.

1280

Bleh, bleh-bleh.

1281

Imagine if that guy knew he
was talking to the real Drac.

1282
01:13:00,585 --> 01:13:02,258
He'd run for the hills!

Hold it, now. Hold it, now.

That sounds spot on.

1285
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:10,475
But the only way they'd know the
real us is if we show the real us.

1286
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:11,767
This could work.

All right. Continue.

he's got to get to the airport!

through this crowd!
