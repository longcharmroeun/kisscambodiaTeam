00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rocket.</font>

00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very good job!</font>

4
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's how...</font>

5
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's how... we'll get away.</font>

6
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go find your mother.</font>

7
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the radio?</font>

8
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Might help us boost the signal.</font>

9
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For you.</font>

10
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:44,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

11
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll be dark soon.</font>

12
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen to me...</font>

13
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Too loud.</font>

14
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:36,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">S.</font>

15
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:37,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">S.O.</font>

16
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">S.O.S.</font>

17
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:39,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">S.</font>

18
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:40,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">S.O.</font>

19
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:41,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">S.O.S.</font>

20
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:39,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dinner.</font>

21
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:04,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</font>

22
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:33,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

23
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beautiful.</font>

24
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:28,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't say anything.</font>

25
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You cannot go down there!</font>

26
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:54,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not?</font>

27
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know why.</font>

28
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not a child! I won't make a sound!</font>

29
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just don't.</font>

30
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

31
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:18,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This time, I took small
amplifiers from the stereo.</font>

32
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It.</font>

33
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It. Won't.</font>

34
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It. Won't. Work.</font>

35
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, this should increase
the frequency to...</font>

36
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It.</font>

37
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:26,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It. Never.</font>

38
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:27,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It. Never. Works!</font>

39
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But...</font>

40
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:32,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we'll keep trying</font>

41
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:35,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until it does.</font>

42
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:48,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop.</font>

43
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop.</font>

44
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just</font>

45
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop.</font>

46
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember, you need to divide.</font>

47
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Carry the three.</font>

48
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amazing!</font>

49
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Time to go.</font>

50
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...please don't make me go...</font>

51
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be fine.</font>

52
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your father will always protect you.</font>

53
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:11,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your father will always protect you.
Always.</font>

54
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen to me...</font>

55
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's important that you learn these things.</font>

56
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He just wants you to be able
to take care of yourself.</font>

57
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:37,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...to take care of me.</font>

58
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...when I'm old...</font>

59
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and grey...</font>

60
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and I have no teeth...</font>

61
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:57,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry.</font>

62
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to go.</font>

63
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:15,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing to be scared of.</font>

64
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...of course there is.</font>

65
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll go.</font>

66
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:27,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you to stay and help your mother.</font>

67
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:42,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to go.</font>

68
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just stay here.</font>

69
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be safe.</font>

70
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:02,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...next time.</font>

71
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:30,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll hear you.</font>

72
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll hear you.</font>

73
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:37,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at me.</font>

74
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen.</font>

75
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:45,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The river...</font>

76
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The river... is loud.</font>

77
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:51,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Small sounds...</font>

78
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Small sounds... safe.</font>

79
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:55,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Big sounds...</font>

80
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Big sounds... not safe.</font>

81
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unless...</font>

82
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there's another sound nearby...</font>

83
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there's another sound nearby...
that's louder.</font>

84
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're safe.</font>

85
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna show you something.</font>

86
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey,</font>

87
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're all right.</font>

88
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're all right.</font>

89
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:12,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I promise.</font>

90
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't you let her come?</font>

91
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:46,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you blame her</font>

92
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for what happened?</font>

93
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

94
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because she blames herself.</font>

95
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was no one's fault.</font>

96
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You still love her, right?</font>

97
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course I do.</font>

98
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should tell her.</font>

99
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:43,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rocket.</font>

100
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:47,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you...</font>

101
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:48,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you... to make a sound...</font>

102
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you... to make a sound...
that's louder.</font>

103
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:53,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your mother...</font>

104
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:55,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your mother... needs your help.</font>

105
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:57,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You.</font>

106
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:57,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You. Can.</font>

107
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:58,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You. Can. Do this.</font>

108
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:35,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh...</font>

109
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:28,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh...</font>

110
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:30,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. It's okay.</font>

111
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:32,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're safe.</font>

112
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They can't hear us.</font>

113
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It worked.</font>

114
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just need to rest now.</font>

115
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:55,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are they?</font>

116
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:59,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are they?</font>

117
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:02,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll find them.</font>

118
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:09,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, she was with me.
She was with me, and...</font>

119
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:11,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then I had to go and do laundry, and...</font>

120
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was with you. How did he...</font>

121
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:16,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rockets.</font>

122
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So he'd still be there.</font>

123
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:25,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sure he is.
- He knows to wait for you.</font>

124
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And she is...</font>

125
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:30,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's smart. She'll have found a place.</font>

126
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:32,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They know what to do.</font>

127
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:53,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a boy.</font>

128
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:57,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a boy.</font>

129
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:03,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could've carried him.</font>

130
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:13,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was so heavy, wasn't he?</font>

131
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:19,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can still...</font>

132
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:24,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can still feel the weight in my arms.</font>

133
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:27,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Small, but</font>

134
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so heavy.</font>

135
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:40,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And my hands were free.</font>

136
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:48,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was carrying the bag,
but my hands were free.</font>

137
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:50,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to stop.</font>

138
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I could've carried him.</font>

139
00:59:58,136 --> 00:59:59,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should've carried him.</font>

140
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:08,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are we</font>

141
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if we can't protect them?</font>

142
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:16,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are we?</font>

143
01:00:19,074 --> 01:00:21,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to protect them.</font>

144
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:24,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Promise me</font>

145
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you will protect them.</font>
