00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:56,217
I'm here to interview for one
of the temporary positions.

159
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:58,653
Because of the wedding.

160
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,989
What wedding?

161
00:09:01,056 --> 00:09:03,358
Preeta and Ben. [chuckles]

162
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:06,462
Ah. As in, like,
the Preeta and Ben?

163
00:09:06,527 --> 00:09:08,663
New York society's
favorite couple.

164
00:09:08,729 --> 00:09:10,065
It's going to be
quite the event.

165
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,767
- Huh.
- [exhales deeply]

166
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:14,268
The hotel is hiring?

167
00:09:14,335 --> 00:09:16,137
Yes, but they're
very exclusive.

168
00:09:16,204 --> 00:09:18,806
They certainly wouldn't
hire you. [chuckles]

169
00:09:18,873 --> 00:09:20,008
Mm.

170
00:09:21,475 --> 00:09:23,412
And what did you say
your name was again?

171
00:09:24,245 --> 00:09:25,547
Linda Perrybottom.

172
00:09:25,614 --> 00:09:26,849
Linda Perrybottom,

173
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,318
unfortunately,
you just failed the test.

174
00:09:29,384 --> 00:09:30,351
What?

175
00:09:30,418 --> 00:09:31,852
Your interview
started the minute

176
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,121
that you walked in the door.

177
00:09:33,187 --> 00:09:34,355
I didn't realize, I just...

178
00:09:34,422 --> 00:09:35,989
Employees
of the Royal Gate Hotel

179
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:38,192
must be accommodating,
masterly,

180
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:40,329
but above all, Linda,

181
00:09:40,396 --> 00:09:41,430
discreet.

182
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,665
If they're telling
a perfect stranger

183
00:09:43,731 --> 00:09:45,166
the intimate details

184
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:47,634
of the inner workings of
this hotel's private events,

185
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:49,336
well, that doesn't
quite cut it now, does it?

186
00:09:49,403 --> 00:09:51,605
- I'd...
- May I see your resume?

187
00:09:51,672 --> 00:09:53,408
- Please?
- Uh...

188
00:09:53,475 --> 00:09:54,810
Yes, of course.

189
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,076
Thank you.

190
00:09:56,143 --> 00:09:57,778
[chuckles, snorts]

191
00:09:57,845 --> 00:09:59,114
Oh, wow.

192
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,749
Yeah, you've had
a lot of really cool jobs.

193
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:01,883
Yes, I have.

194
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,518
- [hesitantly] The Dorsey?
- Dorsey.

195
00:10:03,585 --> 00:10:05,821
[hesitantly] The Armada.

196
00:10:05,887 --> 00:10:07,756
These all are hotels?

197
00:10:07,822 --> 00:10:09,990
Well, none are in New York.
I just moved here from London.

198
00:10:10,057 --> 00:10:11,359
Listen, Linda.

199
00:10:11,426 --> 00:10:12,393
I don't think you're right
for this weekend.

200
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,761
Oh.

201
00:10:13,827 --> 00:10:14,929
[smacks lips, sighs]

202
00:10:14,997 --> 00:10:17,132
We just need someone more...

203
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:20,268
local.

204
00:10:24,272 --> 00:10:25,474
Well, I understand.

205
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,710
Thank you for the opportunity.

206
00:10:37,118 --> 00:10:38,453
Hi. If I wanted to apply

207
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,254
for a temporary position
for this weekend...

208
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:41,556
Is this your resume?

209
00:10:41,623 --> 00:10:42,991
- No, it's not.
- Wow, this is impressive.

210
00:10:43,057 --> 00:10:46,527
[chuckles] My only... copy.

211
00:10:46,595 --> 00:10:49,263
Well, you are definitely
gonna get hired.

212
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,733
In fact, I'm gonna
call them right now.

213
00:10:50,798 --> 00:10:51,899
Right now?

214
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:53,734
- Yeah.
- [chuckles nervously]

215
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:55,103
[dialing]

216
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:56,403
- Lola...
- Mm-hmm?

217
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,642
if I wanted to shop for,
say, a jacket...

218
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:02,777
Uh, yeah, sure.
Just to the left over there.

219
00:11:02,844 --> 00:11:04,313
Thank you so much.

220
00:11:04,378 --> 00:11:06,214
- [clears throat]
- Hi, yeah, we have

221
00:11:06,281 --> 00:11:08,816
a very lovely young lady
down at the front desk.

222
00:11:08,883 --> 00:11:10,451
Uh, she's going to be...

223
00:11:10,518 --> 00:11:11,787
[mid-tempo instrumental
music playing]

224
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:26,134
[grunting]

225
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,438
[groans]

226
00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:34,776
[upbeat hip-hop music plays]

227
00:11:34,843 --> 00:11:36,945
Well, well, well. [chuckles]

228
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,512
Look at what we got here.

229
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,215
You know,
if I wasn't a betting cat,

230
00:11:40,281 --> 00:11:41,482
I'd say Tommy boy here

231
00:11:41,548 --> 00:11:43,018
is trying to break
into the hotel.

232
00:11:43,084 --> 00:11:44,352
That's sure what it looks like.

233
00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:45,787
[Topsy] This here is our alley,
punk!

234
00:11:45,854 --> 00:11:47,355
Which makes this our hotel!

235
00:11:47,422 --> 00:11:48,623
[Butch] Wait, hold up.

236
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,492
Are you trying
to break into our hotel?

237
00:11:50,557 --> 00:11:52,192
Yo, guys, don't worry about it.

238
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:53,894
It was a big misunderstanding.

239
00:11:53,961 --> 00:11:55,330
- Right, Tom?
- [laughs]

240
00:11:55,397 --> 00:11:56,998
Are you laughing at me?

241
00:11:57,065 --> 00:11:59,667
Now, I'm sure you know what
I do to cats that laugh at me.

242
00:11:59,734 --> 00:12:01,703
[Topsy] Come on, boss!
Preach! Preach to him!

243
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:04,672
Now, I was about to,
if you would shut that grill

244
00:12:04,739 --> 00:12:05,706
and let me handle this.

245
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:07,109
[Topsy] My bad, boss.

246
00:12:07,176 --> 00:12:08,475
- So, are you gonna answer me?
- [whistles]

247
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:10,311
[brakes screech, engine revs]

248
00:12:10,378 --> 00:12:12,047
[Lightning] Oh, snap!
It's five-o! Drop and run!

249
00:12:12,113 --> 00:12:14,616
- [Meathead] Oh, no, not again!
- Somebody pick me up,

250
00:12:14,682 --> 00:12:16,484
- I can't run that fast!
- Hey, I'll see you again, Tom!

251
00:12:16,551 --> 00:12:17,585
- [Lightning] Break yourself!
- [officer] Hey, get back here!

252
00:12:20,088 --> 00:12:21,356
Phew!

253
00:12:22,757 --> 00:12:24,258
[wood creaks]

254
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:31,532
Oh, yeah!

255
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,801
[sensual jazz music playing]

256
00:12:47,581 --> 00:12:48,782
Welcome.

257
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:49,984
Thank you so much.

258
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:51,720
- You must be...
- Hi. <i>Buongiorno.</i>

259
00:12:51,787 --> 00:12:54,089
Forester, Kayla.

260
00:12:54,156 --> 00:12:56,758
I'm sorry in advance
about my resume,

261
00:12:56,825 --> 00:12:58,893
but there was
a child downstairs

262
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,163
trying to spit their
Hubba Bubba under a table.

263
00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:04,398
So I tore off a piece.

264
00:13:05,566 --> 00:13:09,137
Good. I'm Terence Mendoza,
Events Manager.

265
00:13:09,204 --> 00:13:11,106
And this is Mr. Henry Dubros.

266
00:13:11,172 --> 00:13:12,273
- Hi.
- [Mr. Dubros] A pleasure.

267
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,609
[Terence]
He's our general manager.

268
00:13:13,675 --> 00:13:14,809
[chuckles]

269
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,578
And I assume that that's
the aquatics manager?

270
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:20,547
That's Goldie.

271
00:13:20,614 --> 00:13:22,984
She has no official position
at the hotel. That's a fish.

272
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:25,387
- [Kayla] That's the...
- [Mr. Dubros clears throat]

273
00:13:25,454 --> 00:13:28,524
I must say, this is
a very impressive resume.

274
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:30,191
The Dorsey?

275
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:32,360
Oh. [softly] The Dorsey.

276
00:13:32,426 --> 00:13:33,894
You know, I hate to name names,

277
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:35,596
but, uh, I will.

278
00:13:35,662 --> 00:13:39,133
You must have known
Mrs. Josephine Pennybaker.

279
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,069
She was my mentor at Cornell.

280
00:13:41,134 --> 00:13:42,369
It's an Ivy League school

281
00:13:42,436 --> 00:13:44,373
founded in 1865
by Mr. Ezra Cornell.

282
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:45,941
That's where I got my master's.

283
00:13:47,175 --> 00:13:48,343
I'm just sharing.

284
00:13:48,409 --> 00:13:50,978
Of course I know
old Jojo Pennyfoot.

285
00:13:51,046 --> 00:13:52,246
[chuckles] Yeah. What a hoot.

286
00:13:52,312 --> 00:13:53,681
- [Mr. Dubros chuckles]
- Pennyfoot?

287
00:13:53,748 --> 00:13:55,816
Well, Miss Forester,
we'll cut to the chase.

288
00:13:55,883 --> 00:13:57,219
As I'm sure you know,

289
00:13:57,284 --> 00:13:58,919
we have
a very high-profile event

290
00:13:58,986 --> 00:14:00,454
happening here this weekend.

291
00:14:00,522 --> 00:14:03,023
Of course, I'm very aware
of Ben and Preeta's wedding.

292
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,594
Well, we need to hire additional
staff through the week.

293
00:14:05,661 --> 00:14:08,162
But they must maintain
the level of service

294
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:09,696
guests of
the Royal Gate expect.

295
00:14:09,763 --> 00:14:11,566
- Nonetheless.
- And I'll be honest,

296
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:14,302
it's not often we come across
a resume this distinguished.

297
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:16,303
Excuse me,

298
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,607
but this, this is just
a piece of paper.

299
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:22,310
If I'm gonna be worthy
of this institution,

300
00:14:22,377 --> 00:14:24,680
you need to see me in...

301
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:26,814
[exhales sharply]

302
00:14:28,383 --> 00:14:29,484
action.

303
00:14:30,884 --> 00:14:32,687
Are you gonna pick it up
or just leave it there?

304
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:34,956
Yes, sir.

305
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:38,359
Put it in the bin.

306
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:44,065
Terence.

307
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:44,965
[whispering] She thought the fish
was the head of the department.

308
00:14:45,032 --> 00:14:46,268
Really?

309
00:14:46,335 --> 00:14:48,134
A fish can't even walk.
It can't even...

310
00:14:48,201 --> 00:14:49,503
Terence.

311
00:14:49,571 --> 00:14:50,571
[grunts]

312
00:14:51,739 --> 00:14:52,639
You're hired.

313
00:14:52,706 --> 00:14:54,408
- [chuckles dryly] Really?
- Yes.

314
00:14:54,475 --> 00:14:57,077
I mean, thank you.

315
00:14:57,144 --> 00:14:58,111
Can you start today?

316
00:14:58,178 --> 00:14:59,179
[exhales sharply]

317
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:02,250
That's gonna be a tall order.

318
00:15:02,316 --> 00:15:05,286
Mm... Very in demand.

319
00:15:05,353 --> 00:15:07,455
Okay. Yeah, you know what?

320
00:15:07,522 --> 00:15:08,790
I'm gonna pull some strings.

321
00:15:08,856 --> 00:15:10,658
It's difficult,
but, yeah, no problem.

322
00:15:10,725 --> 00:15:11,859
One other thing.

323
00:15:11,926 --> 00:15:13,860
Uh, we will be asking
all temporary staff

324
00:15:13,927 --> 00:15:14,995
to stay at the hotel

325
00:15:15,062 --> 00:15:16,664
through the week
leading up to the wedding.

326
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,499
Uh, just so that we can be
available to guests

327

at a moment's notice.

328
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:20,935
Is that something
you'd be comfortable with?

329

Anything for this hotel.

It's more professional.

- by 1962.
- Mm.

341
00:15:58,773 --> 00:16:00,607
It's been through
two major renovations,

342
00:16:00,675 --> 00:16:03,712
yet it remains the beacon
of service excellence.

And it will be
a perfect success.

It has to be.

360
00:16:39,147 --> 00:16:42,182
The positive press an event
of this magnitude can generate

361
00:16:42,249 --> 00:16:43,684
is invaluable.

362

He's a bit tricky,

[Terence] Yes. And she'll be
helping us out this week.

And by "shy," I mean,

she... She scratches

the one on 11th Street
is particularly luxurious.

470

But are the people uptight?

471
00:20:27,942 --> 00:20:29,810
Because... I mean,
do they yell at the dogs

472
00:20:29,877 --> 00:20:31,378
- for being off-leash?

953
00:41:38,377 --> 00:41:41,046
Oh! It's a motorized
skateboard. I love those.

954
00:41:41,114 --> 00:41:43,215
It's got, uh, you know, Wi-Fi.

955
00:41:43,282 --> 00:41:45,851
Why does a skateboard
need Wi-Fi?

956
00:41:45,918 --> 00:41:47,387
Why the fi not?

957

961
00:41:53,927 --> 00:41:56,529
- Yeah, uh, he's right here.
- [Ben whispers] Who is it?

962
00:41:56,596 --> 00:41:57,496
[Preeta] My dad.

963
00:41:57,563 --> 00:41:58,865
What? Do I look okay?

964
00:41:58,931 --> 00:42:00,067
For a phone call? Yes.

965
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:01,701
Right.

966
00:42:01,768 --> 00:42:04,637
One second. Phew.

967
00:42:04,703 --> 00:42:05,971
Hello, Mr. Mehta.

968
00:42:06,038 --> 00:42:07,540
You sound like
you look amazing.

969
00:42:08,507 --> 00:42:10,176
Uh-huh?

970
00:42:10,243 --> 00:42:12,011
- If you need anything at all, please don't hesitate to call.
- Yeah.

We'll help you accordingly.

You know what, Terence,

973
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:17,684
Spike got into some burritos

974
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,850
- earlier and, well...
- Huh?

975
00:42:18,918 --> 00:42:21,488
I was, you know. Do you mind?

976
00:42:22,855 --> 00:42:24,724
[Terence] Um... Of course.

977

[chuckles] Kayla, can you...

980
00:42:30,362 --> 00:42:32,799
Uh, actually,
I would love to keep Kayla

981
00:42:32,864 --> 00:42:34,100
and maybe run through

982
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:36,469
some bridesmaids-related stuff
with her.

983
00:42:36,536 --> 00:42:38,638
- You know, coordinating colors.
- Sure.

984
00:42:38,705 --> 00:42:40,273
I have a very good eye.

985
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:42,308
No, that's fine. I'll just
run through it all with Kayla.

986
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:47,380
Here we go. I got the lead.
I got the lead. Come on.

- [Kayla] Yes.

994
00:43:02,561 --> 00:43:05,098
- Wow, what a view!
- [pigeons cooing]

995
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,067
So, what are
your bridesmaids colors?

996
00:43:07,132 --> 00:43:08,301
I lost my ring.

997
00:43:08,935 --> 00:43:10,103
The big one?

998
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,904
Yeah, my big one.
My... My only one.

999
00:43:11,971 --> 00:43:13,273
How?

1000
00:43:13,339 --> 00:43:15,241
Well, I was,
I was on my way to the spa,

1001
00:43:15,308 --> 00:43:17,277
and Ben had told me
to put it in the safe

1002
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,978
because he's always convinced
that I'm gonna lose it.

1003
00:43:19,045 --> 00:43:21,114
But you did lose it.

1004
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,849
Yeah, I mean, I misplaced it.

1005
00:43:22,915 --> 00:43:24,683
I thought first someone
must've taken it, but...

1006
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:28,754
And would you say
that it is still in the spa?

1007
00:43:28,822 --> 00:43:30,156
Or the pool.

1008
00:43:30,223 --> 00:43:31,858
Or the lounge. I was
all over the place today,

1009
00:43:31,924 --> 00:43:34,527
but I don't want Ben to know
that it was ever missing.

1010
00:43:34,594 --> 00:43:37,831
Really? I mean,
won't he just be all adorable

1011
00:43:37,897 --> 00:43:39,198
and understanding about it?

1012
00:43:39,264 --> 00:43:40,333
[whispers] Babe,
that was a really big ring.

1013
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,536
- Ah. Understood.
- [Preeta] Hey.

1014
00:43:43,036 --> 00:43:44,104
Hi.

1015
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:45,638
- Hi.
- What did my dad want?

1016
00:43:45,705 --> 00:43:47,840
Nothing. He was just, uh,
we were just kinda bonding.

1017
00:43:47,907 --> 00:43:49,009
Great.

1018
00:43:53,813 --> 00:43:55,248
Uh, where is your ring?

1019
00:43:56,116 --> 00:43:56,983
Which ring?

1020
00:43:57,049 --> 00:43:58,284
Your engagement ring?

1021
00:43:58,351 --> 00:44:01,788
The giant one
that I gave you for love.

1022
00:44:01,855 --> 00:44:04,190
Oh, um... I...

1023
00:44:04,257 --> 00:44:06,226
Uh, the thing is...

1024
00:44:06,293 --> 00:44:09,195
It's a funny story
actually, sir.

1025
00:44:09,261 --> 00:44:10,729
I actually took it.

1026
00:44:10,797 --> 00:44:11,865
Yes, I did.

1027
00:44:11,931 --> 00:44:14,133
- To go get cleaned.
- Oh.

1028
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:16,802
I took it to go get
a scrub-a-dub

1029
00:44:16,868 --> 00:44:18,804
and be all shiny
for the wedding.

Bright as bright as a diamond.

1031
00:44:20,505 --> 00:44:22,107
Great. That's actually
very thoughtful.

1032

- Thank you.
- Thank you, Kayla.

1033

By the way, we really wanna put

some kind of gratuity
for you on the bill.

By the way,
quick question for you.

1068
00:45:34,181 --> 00:45:36,516
Say a VIP person lost a ring

1069
00:45:36,581 --> 00:45:39,217
and someone wanted
to look for said ring

without raising any eyebrows,

1071
00:45:41,587 --> 00:45:43,489
where would you say
that person should look?

1072
00:45:43,556 --> 00:45:47,159
Oh, my God, I, I,
I love riddles. Um...

1073
00:45:47,226 --> 00:45:49,962
Well, if I were that someone,

1074
00:45:50,029 --> 00:45:50,962
ah, but I'm not.

1075
00:45:51,029 --> 00:45:52,431

00:45:59,438 --> 00:46:01,607
Sorry, back to the question.
Um...

1079
00:46:01,674 --> 00:46:03,375
It would depend
on the size of the object.

1080
00:46:03,442 --> 00:46:07,147
Is it a car? Is it alive?
Could it be a dog?

Don't tell anyone, please,

[Terence faintly] Kayla,
and what would you call this, huh?

1283
00:55:40,652 --> 00:55:41,752
[Kayla] This was a mistake.

1284
00:55:41,819 --> 00:55:43,388
It was
a total misunderstanding.

1285
00:55:43,456 --> 00:55:45,123
[Terence]
This is a dereliction of duty!

1286
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:47,894
And it's a reflection
of the absence of character!

[clatters]

1288
00:55:51,163 --> 00:55:52,697
It's an embarrassment
to the hotel.

1289
00:55:52,764 --> 00:55:54,032
And it's an insult to you.

1290
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,967
That's how serious
this matter is, sir.

1291
00:55:56,034 --> 00:55:57,002
I agree.

1292
00:55:58,203 --> 00:56:00,238
Terence,
I'm placing you on leave.

1293
00:56:00,306 --> 00:56:01,507
What?

1294
00:56:01,572 --> 00:56:03,475
It's clear that the magnitude
of this wedding

1295
00:56:03,543 --> 00:56:05,310
has overwhelmed you and you're
in something of a state.

1296
00:56:05,377 --> 00:56:07,179
- I think a break would...
- Hold on a sec. Let me make sure

1297
00:56:07,246 --> 00:56:08,614
that we're
on the same page here

1298
00:56:08,681 --> 00:56:10,749
regarding
the basic facts of this.

1299
00:56:10,815 --> 00:56:13,118
The cat
that she forced us to hire

1300
00:56:13,185 --> 00:56:16,020
failed to catch the mouse.

1301
00:56:16,087 --> 00:56:17,589
Kayla said
she got rid of the mouse.

1302
00:56:17,656 --> 00:56:18,757
Isn't that right?

1303
00:56:19,659 --> 00:56:21,260
- That is what I said.
- Ah!

1304
00:56:21,326 --> 00:56:25,297
That is what you said.
But that is not what you did.

1305
00:56:25,364 --> 00:56:29,502
The mouse that caused all that
destruction to our lobby

1306
00:56:29,567 --> 00:56:30,701
is still in the hotel.

1307
00:56:30,768 --> 00:56:33,104
I saw him
in the animal tornado.

1308
00:56:33,172 --> 00:56:36,242
Terence, listen to yourself.
No one saw a mouse.

1309
00:56:36,308 --> 00:56:37,375
I saw the mouse.

1310
00:56:37,442 --> 00:56:38,743
But they did see you
acting erratically

1311
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:40,212
towards Miss Forester

1312
00:56:40,279 --> 00:56:42,179
after bringing the groom's
bulldog into a bar.

1313
00:56:42,246 --> 00:56:43,915
She brought the kitty-cat
to the bar, too.

1314
00:56:43,982 --> 00:56:46,018
Tom is an employee.

1315
00:56:46,085 --> 00:56:47,452
He has a name tag.

1316
00:56:47,518 --> 00:56:49,120
This is insane.
I'm going insane right now.

1317
00:56:49,188 --> 00:56:50,623
Well, you're certainly
acting insane.

1318
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:52,858
You caused tens of
thousands of dollars of damage

1319
00:56:52,924 --> 00:56:54,993
to the hotel,
you've terrified our guests,

1320
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:58,697
and now you're attempting
to frame it as Kayla's fault?

1321
00:56:58,764 --> 00:57:00,799
[laughs hysterically]

1322
00:57:00,866 --> 00:57:02,067
You know what?
You can't do this.

1323
00:57:02,134 --> 00:57:04,770
You can't fire
the event manager

1324
00:57:04,837 --> 00:57:07,072
in the middle of an event.

1325
00:57:07,139 --> 00:57:09,975
Please leave
on your own merits, Terence.

1326
00:57:10,042 --> 00:57:11,710
I don't want
to have to call security.

1327
00:57:11,777 --> 00:57:12,878
Please don't do this.

1328

- Oh.

1329

Okay. [exhales heavily]

00:57:18,884 --> 00:57:20,018
Okay.

Oh, my days.

1334
00:57:27,692 --> 00:57:29,060
And I'm not picking it up.

1335
00:57:29,594 --> 00:57:31,429
[door opens]

1336
00:57:31,496 --> 00:57:33,165
- [door slams]
- [Terence] Get your tail out of your ears.

1337
00:57:33,232 --> 00:57:34,900
- [Tom whistling]
- It's disgusting.

1338
00:57:36,735 --> 00:57:37,903
Well, this is a disaster.

1339
00:57:37,969 --> 00:57:39,105
[sighs] Yeah.

1340
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:40,438
Firing our events manager

1341
00:57:40,505 --> 00:57:42,607
before the biggest
and most important event

1342
00:57:42,674 --> 00:57:44,409
this hotel has thrown in years.

1343
00:57:44,476 --> 00:57:46,645
The only reason
I felt comfortable

1344
00:57:46,712 --> 00:57:48,213
asking Terence to take leave

1345
00:57:48,279 --> 00:57:49,447
is because we have someone

1346
00:57:49,514 --> 00:57:51,482
with your wealth
of experience here.

1347
00:57:51,549 --> 00:57:52,884
With the what now?

1348
00:57:52,951 --> 00:57:54,285
I got a call from Miss Preeta.

1349
00:57:54,353 --> 00:57:56,321
She told me
that you quietly found

1350
00:57:56,388 --> 00:57:59,491
a very important missing item
she was looking for.

1351
00:57:59,558 --> 00:58:02,161
- [chuckles uneasily]
- You're multitalented, Kayla.

1352
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:03,295
Do you think you can handle

1353
00:58:03,362 --> 00:58:05,531
the role
of interim event manager?

1354
00:58:06,831 --> 00:58:08,034
Are you kidding?

1355
00:58:08,801 --> 00:58:09,935
Yes, yes, of course.

1356
00:58:10,002 --> 00:58:11,337
It's a massive endeavor.

1357
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:14,440
Sir, "massive endeavor"
is my middle name.

1358
00:58:15,473 --> 00:58:16,441
It's Judith,

1359
00:58:17,174 --> 00:58:18,377
but you get the point.

1360
00:58:18,444 --> 00:58:19,545
I know you're new,

1361
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:21,647
but your employment history
convinces me

1362
00:58:21,712 --> 00:58:23,148
you're qualified
to take this on.

1363
00:58:23,214 --> 00:58:25,683
And who knows, [exhales]
if this weekend goes well,

1364
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:29,020
we may be discussing a more
permanent position on Monday.

1365
00:58:29,087 --> 00:58:32,757
I can't imagine... anything

1366
00:58:32,824 --> 00:58:35,027
that could
possibly mess this up.

1367
00:58:42,868 --> 00:58:44,002
- [Kayla] Stop it.
- [whirring]

1368

You guys gotta stop fighting.

1369
00:58:45,603 --> 00:58:47,572
It's like you've been
doing this for years.

1370
00:58:49,107 --> 00:58:51,643
Listen, first of all,
thank you for the ring.

1371
00:58:53,244 --> 00:58:55,880
Helpful to have it back
after you stole it.

1372
00:58:55,947 --> 00:58:57,215
Never mind.

1373
00:58:57,282 --> 00:58:58,549
Remember when I said
to the both of you

1374
00:58:58,616 --> 00:59:01,152
that letting you stay here
wasn't up to me?

1375
00:59:01,587 --> 00:59:02,521
Well,

1376
00:59:03,855 --> 00:59:05,323
if you look right there,

1377
00:59:06,958 --> 00:59:08,726
I'm in charge now, all right?

1378
00:59:08,793 --> 00:59:10,096
And this wedding

1379
00:59:10,161 --> 00:59:11,464
- it's a huge responsibility.
- [sniffing]

1380
00:59:11,529 --> 00:59:13,098
It's the shot
that I've been waiting for

1381
00:59:13,165 --> 00:59:15,100
and I can't screw it up.

1382
00:59:15,167 --> 00:59:17,335
So, you two, you gotta go.

1383

[clears throat]

1384
00:59:22,975 --> 00:59:24,509
Stop looking at me like that.

[sniffles]

1386
00:59:29,714 --> 00:59:31,482
Ugh! Okay.

1387
00:59:31,549 --> 00:59:33,185
Maybe you can stay here.

1388
00:59:33,819 --> 00:59:35,554
But not like this.

1389
00:59:35,619 --> 00:59:38,056
Uh-uh. That little mess
you caused downstairs,

1390
00:59:38,123 --> 00:59:39,390
it's a disaster.

1391
00:59:39,458 --> 00:59:41,427
You know what,
you wanna stay, right?

1392
00:59:43,228 --> 00:59:45,598
Fine. One condition.

1393
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:50,002
You two have to prove to me
that you can coexist together.

1394
00:59:50,069 --> 00:59:52,304
And stay as far away
from here as possible.

1395
00:59:52,871 --> 00:59:54,006
Got it?

1396
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,041
So, tomorrow,

1397
00:59:56,107 --> 00:59:57,341
I'm gonna plan an entire day

1398
00:59:57,409 --> 00:59:58,677
for you two to spend together

1399
00:59:59,712 --> 01:00:01,980
out there, in the Big Apple.

1400
01:00:02,681 --> 01:00:04,449
And if you do this,

1401
01:00:04,516 --> 01:00:05,484
you guys can stay.

1402
01:00:06,951 --> 01:00:08,119
Do we have a deal?

1403
01:00:10,554 --> 01:00:12,123
Your car will be here
at 9:00 a.m.

1404
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:14,058
Don't be late.
