Movietown News presents:
Spotlight on Adventure.

2
00:00:52,394 --> 00:00:53,435
What you are now witnessing ...

3
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,063
is footage never before seen
by civilized humanity,

4
00:00:56,148 --> 00:00:57,898
a lost world in South America.

5
00:00:57,983 --> 00:01:00,192
Lurking in the shadow
of majestic Paradise Falls,

6
00:01:00,318 --> 00:01:03,237
it sports plants and animals
undiscovered by science.

7
00:01:03,655 --> 00:01:06,574
Who would dare set foot
on this inhospitable summit?

8
00:01:06,992 --> 00:01:10,578
Why, our subject today,
Charles Muntz!

9
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:13,747
The beloved explorer lands his
dirigible the Spirit of Adventure,

10
00:01:13,832 --> 00:01:15,249
in New Hampshire this week,

11
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:18,377
completing a year-long expedition
to the lost world.

12
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,380
This lighter-than-air craft
was designed by Muntz himself ...

13
00:01:21,506 --> 00:01:25,426
and is longer than 22 prohibition
paddy wagons placed end to end.

14
00:01:25,844 --> 00:01:28,262
And here comes the adventurer now.

15
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,472
Never apart from his faithful dogs,

16
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:32,892
Muntz conceived the craft
for canine comfort.

17
00:01:33,018 --> 00:01:35,019
It's a veritable floating palace
in the sky,

18
00:01:35,103 --> 00:01:38,564
complete with doggy bath
and mechanical canine walker.

19
00:01:39,357 --> 00:01:42,860
And, Jiminy Cricket do the locals
consider Muntz the bee's knees.

20
00:01:42,944 --> 00:01:44,278
And how!

21
00:01:44,696 --> 00:01:46,739
Adventure is out there!

22
00:01:49,034 --> 00:01:51,452
But what has Muntz brought back
this time?

23
00:01:51,536 --> 00:01:56,290
Gentlemen, I give you
the monster of Paradise Falls!

24
00:01:57,792 --> 00:02:01,295
And, golly,
what a swell monster this is!

25
00:02:01,713 --> 00:02:04,048
But what's this? Scientists cry foul.

26
00:02:04,132 --> 00:02:06,300
The National Explorer's Society
accuses Muntz ...

27
00:02:06,384 --> 00:02:08,135
of fabricating the skeleton.

28
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,386
No!

29
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:11,180
The organization strips Muntz ...

30
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,473
of his membership.

31
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,145
Humiliated, Muntz vows a return
to Paradise Falls ...

32
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,148
and promises
to capture the beast alive!

33
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:23,943
I promise to capture the beast alive,

34
00:02:24,986 --> 00:02:27,738
and I will not come back until I do!

35
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:31,784
And so,
the explorer's off to clear his name.

36
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,535
Bon voyage, Charles Muntz,

37
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,082
and good luck capturing
the monster of Paradise Falls!

38
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,340
Here's Charles Muntz ...

39
00:02:46,424 --> 00:02:48,676
piloting his famous dirigible.

40
00:02:52,764 --> 00:02:54,807
He hurdles Pikes Peak.

41
00:02:56,017 --> 00:02:57,893
He hurdles the Grand Canyon.

42
00:02:59,354 --> 00:03:00,938
He hurdles Mount Everest.

43
00:03:03,858 --> 00:03:06,610
He goes around Mount Everest.

44
00:03:07,278 --> 00:03:09,530
Is there nothing he cannot do?

45
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,909
Yes, as Muntz himself says,
"Adventure is ..."

46
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:17,496
Adventure is out there!
Look out!

47
00:03:17,622 --> 00:03:20,499
Mount Rushmore! Hard to starboard!

48
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:24,461
Must get Spirit of Adventure
over Mount Rushmore!

49
00:03:24,546 --> 00:03:28,632
Hold together, old girl.
How're my dogs doing?

50
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:36,140
All engines, ahead full!
Let's take her up to 26,000 feet.

51
00:03:36,391 --> 00:03:39,018
Rudders 18 degrees towards the south.

52
00:03:39,144 --> 00:03:42,896
It's a beautiful day.
Winds out of the east at 10 knots.

53
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:47,484
Visibility unlimited.
Enter the weather in the logbook.

54
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:51,822
Oh! There's something down there.
I will bring it back for science.

55
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:58,620
Aw! It's a puppy! Ah! No time!
A storm! Lightning. Hail.

56
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,164
- What are you doing?
- Ahhh!

57
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:03,167
Don't you know
this is an exclusive club?

58
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:05,210
Only explorers get in here,

59
00:04:05,295 --> 00:04:09,214
not just any kid off the street
with a helmet and a pair of goggles.

60
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,217
Do you think you've got what it takes?
Well, do you?

61
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:16,055
All right, you're in.
Welcome aboard.

62
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,059
What's wrong? Can't you talk?

63
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,563
Hey, I don't bite.

64
00:04:28,818 --> 00:04:31,445
You and me, we're in a club now.

65
00:04:35,617 --> 00:04:39,286
I saw where your balloon went.
Come on. Let's go get it.

66
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,247
My name's Ellie.

67
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:46,919
There it is.

68
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:53,008
Well, go ahead.

69
00:04:58,014 --> 00:04:59,431
Go on.

70
00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:20,911
Ow.

71
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:22,329
Hey, kid!

72
00:05:23,915 --> 00:05:25,666
Thought you might need
a little cheering up.

73
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,584
I got something to show you.

74
00:05:29,838 --> 00:05:32,297
I am about to let you
see something ...

75
00:05:32,382 --> 00:05:35,133
I have never shown
to another human being.

76
00:05:35,593 --> 00:05:37,594
Ever! In my life!

77
00:05:38,596 --> 00:05:41,890
You'll have to swear
you will not tell anyone.

78
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:45,269
Cross your heart. Do it!

79
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,190
My Adventure Book.

80
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,485
You know him.

81
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:57,239
Charles Muntz, explorer.

82
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:00,367
When I get big,
I'm going where he's going,

83
00:06:01,244 --> 00:06:06,039
South America.
It's like America, but south.

84
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,709
Wanna know where I'm gonna live?

85
00:06:09,294 --> 00:06:13,672
"Paradise Falls, a land lost in time."

86
00:06:14,883 --> 00:06:18,051
I ripped this
right out of a library book.

87
00:06:19,262 --> 00:06:22,806
I'm gonna move my clubhouse there
and park it right next to the falls.

88
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,517
Who knows what lives up there.

89
00:06:26,144 --> 00:06:27,728
And once I get there?

90
00:06:27,812 --> 00:06:31,773
Well, I'm saving these pages for
all the adventures I'm gonna have.

91
00:06:32,942 --> 00:06:37,738
Only I just don't know
how I'm gonna get to Paradise Falls.

92
00:06:44,746 --> 00:06:47,539
That's it!
You can take us there in a blimp!

93
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:50,584
Swear you'll take us!
Cross your heart!

94
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:55,714
Cross it! Cross your heart!
Good, you promised. No backing out.

95
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,259
Well, see you tomorrow, kid. Bye!

96
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:03,347
Adventure is out there!

97
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,184
You know, you don't talk very much.

98
00:07:08,102 --> 00:07:09,394
I like you!

99
00:07:12,023 --> 00:07:13,231
Wow.

100
00:12:00,478 --> 00:12:01,561
Hah!

101
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,201
Stevie, throw me a deuce!

102
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,414
Quite a sight, huh, Ellie?

103
00:13:48,085 --> 00:13:50,253
Uh! Mail's here.

104
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:07,562
Shady Oaks Retirement.
Oh, brother.

105
00:14:09,732 --> 00:14:10,774
Hmm ...

106
00:14:16,781 --> 00:14:19,991
Hey! Morning, Mr. Fredricksen.
Need any help there?

107
00:14:20,451 --> 00:14:21,951
No. Yes!

108
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:26,206
Tell your boss over there that
you boys are ruining our house.

109
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,791
Well, just to let you know,

110
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:30,460
my boss will be happy to take
this old place off your hands,

111
00:14:30,586 --> 00:14:32,962
and for double his last offer!

112
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,255
What do you say to that?

113
00:14:37,134 --> 00:14:38,843
Uh, I take that as a "no," then?

114
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:42,305
I believe I made my position
to your boss quite clear.

115
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:44,933
You poured prune juice
in his gas tank.

116
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,186
Yeah, that was good.
Here, let me talk to him.

117
00:14:51,273 --> 00:14:55,860
You in the suit.
Yes, you. Take a bath, hippie!

118
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:58,363
I am not with him!

119
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:02,033
This is serious!
He's out to get your house.

120
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:05,119
Tell your boss
he can have our house.

121
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,664
- Really?
- When I'm dead!

122
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,501
I'll take that as a maybe.

123
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,837
Order now,
you get the camera,

124
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:17,131
you get the printer,
4x optical zoom,

125
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,717
Schneider lens, photo printer,
SD card.

126
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:27,642
"Good afternoon.
My name is Russell."

127
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:33,022
"And I am a Wilderness Explorer
in Tribe 54, Sweat Lodge 12."

128
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,150
"Are you in need
of any assistance today, sir?"

129
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,277
No.

130
00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:40,530
- I could help you cross the street.
- No.

131
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:44,576
- I could help you cross your yard.
- No.

132
00:15:44,702 --> 00:15:48,329
- I could help you cross your porch.
- No.

133
00:15:48,706 --> 00:15:50,748
Well,
I gotta help you cross something.

134
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,876
No. I'm doing fine.

135
00:15:59,717 --> 00:16:01,676
"Good afternoon.
My name is Russell."

136
00:16:02,887 --> 00:16:03,887
- Kid ... Kid.
- "And I am a Wilderness Explorer ...

137
00:16:05,055 --> 00:16:08,558
- in Tribe 54, Sweat Lodge 12."
- I ... Slow down. Kid!

138
00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:10,894
- "Are you in need of any assistance ..."
- Thank you,

139
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,520
- but I don't need any help!
- " ...today, sir?"

140
00:16:14,356 --> 00:16:15,398
Ow.

141
00:16:19,737 --> 00:16:21,070
Proceed.

142
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,449
- "Good afternoon ..."
- But skip to the end!

143
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:29,370
See these? These are
my Wilderness Explorer badges.

144
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:34,584
You may notice one is missing.
It's my Assisting the Elderly badge.

145
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,380
If I get it, I will become
a Senior Wilderness Explorer.

146
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,091
"The wilderness must be explored!"

147
00:16:42,217 --> 00:16:44,260
Caw, caw! Raar!

148
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,139
It's gonna be great!
There's a big ceremony,

149
00:16:48,265 --> 00:16:51,726
and all the dads come,
and they pin on our badges.

150
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,770
So, you want to assist an old person?

151
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:57,273
Yep! Then I'll be
a Senior Wilderness Explorer.

152
00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:01,611
- You ever heard of a snipe?
- Snipe?

153
00:17:01,946 --> 00:17:03,696
Bird. Beady eyes.

154
00:17:03,781 --> 00:17:07,784
Every night it sneaks in my yard
and gobbles my poor azaleas.

155
00:17:08,285 --> 00:17:13,581
I'm elderly and infirm. I can't catch it.
If only someone could help me.

156
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:17,085
- Me, me! I'll do it!
- I don't know. It's awfully crafty.

157
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:20,129
You'd have to clap your hands
three times to lure it in.

158
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:22,006
I'll find him, Mr. Fredricksen!

159
00:17:22,132 --> 00:17:24,467
I think its burrow is two blocks down.
If you go past ...

160
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:27,637
Two blocks down. Got it! Snipe.

161
00:17:28,597 --> 00:17:30,556
Here, snipey, snipey.

162
00:17:30,641 --> 00:17:32,308
Bring it back here when you find it.

163
00:17:32,434 --> 00:17:33,476
Snipe!

164
00:17:33,602 --> 00:17:34,686
Okay, keep her coming.
Keep coming.

165
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:39,816
And stop. Stop. Stop!

166
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:44,529
Why ... Hey! Hey, you!

167
00:17:44,655 --> 00:17:46,114
What do you ...
What do you think you're doing?

168
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,658
- I am so sorry, sir.
- Don't touch that!

169
00:17:48,784 --> 00:17:50,284
No, no, no.
Let me take care of that for you.

170
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,453
- Get away from our mailbox!
- Hey. Sir, I ...

171
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,038
I don't want you to touch it!

172
00:17:54,164 --> 00:17:55,164
Ow!

173
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,011
Steve, you all right?

174
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,213
Sorry, Mr. Fredricksen.

175
00:18:44,882 --> 00:18:48,551
You don't seem like
a public menace to me. Take this.

176
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:52,722
The guys from Shady Oaks will be by
to pick you up in the morning, okay?

177
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:09,030
What do I do now, Ellie?

178
00:20:38,954 --> 00:20:40,454
Morning, gentlemen.

179
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,499
Good morning, Mr. Fredricksen.
You ready to go?

180
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:46,711
Ready as I'll ever be.

181
00:20:46,837 --> 00:20:49,130
Would you do me a favor
and take this?

182
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,549
I'll meet you at the van
in just a minute.

183
00:20:51,675 --> 00:20:55,970
I wanna say one last goodbye
to the old place.

184
00:20:56,471 --> 00:20:58,848
Sure.
Take all the time you need, sir.

185
00:21:01,476 --> 00:21:05,438
That's typical. He's probably going
to the bathroom for the 80th time.

186
00:21:05,522 --> 00:21:09,192
You think he'd take better
care of his house.

187
00:21:50,734 --> 00:21:55,488
So long, boys! I'll send you a
postcard from Paradise Falls!

188
00:22:43,787 --> 00:22:44,787
Heh!

189
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:26,245
We're on our way, Ellie.

190
00:24:13,126 --> 00:24:14,168
Huh?

191
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:20,341
Hmm.

192
00:24:35,982 --> 00:24:39,402
Hi, Mr. Fredricksen.
It's me, Russell.

193
00:24:39,486 --> 00:24:41,487
What are you doing out here, kid?

194
00:24:41,571 --> 00:24:45,324
I found the snipe
and I followed it under your porch,

195
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:50,246
but this snipe had a long tail
and looked more like a large mouse.

196
00:24:56,044 --> 00:24:57,753
Please let me in.

197
00:24:58,255 --> 00:24:59,422
No.

198
00:25:04,094 --> 00:25:06,178
Oh, alright, you can come ...

199
00:25:14,354 --> 00:25:15,396
Huh.

200
00:25:18,024 --> 00:25:20,609
I've never been
in a floating house before.

201
00:25:22,112 --> 00:25:26,240
Goggles. Look at this stuff.
Wow! You're going on a trip?

202
00:25:26,575 --> 00:25:30,035
"Paradise Falls,
a land lost in time."

203
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,871
You're going to South America,
Mr. Fredricksen?

204
00:25:31,955 --> 00:25:33,789
Don't touch that! You'll soil it.

205
00:25:33,915 --> 00:25:35,958
You know, most people take a plane,

206
00:25:36,042 --> 00:25:39,378
but you're smart because you will
have all your TV and clocks and stuff.

207
00:25:39,463 --> 00:25:42,381
Whoa.
Is this how you steer your house?

208
00:25:42,466 --> 00:25:43,883
Does it really work?

209
00:25:45,135 --> 00:25:46,385
Kid, would you stop with the ...

210
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,053
- This makes it go right.
- Let go of that ...

211
00:25:48,138 --> 00:25:50,639
- And that way's left.
- Knock it off!

212
00:25:50,807 --> 00:25:52,766
Hey, look! Buildings.

213
00:25:53,435 --> 00:25:56,770
That building's so close
I could almost touch it.

214
00:25:59,983 --> 00:26:02,109
Wow! This is great!

215
00:26:02,486 --> 00:26:04,653
You should try this,
Mr. Fredricksen.

216
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:08,157
Look, there's a bus that could
take me home two blocks away!

217
00:26:08,241 --> 00:26:10,784
Hey! I can see your house from here.

218
00:26:11,453 --> 00:26:13,662
Don't jerk around so much, kid. Whoa!

219
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,333
Well, that's not gonna work.

220
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:20,669
I know that cloud.
It's a cumulonimbus.

221
00:26:20,754 --> 00:26:21,837
Did you know that ...

222
00:26:22,255 --> 00:26:23,589
the cumulonimbus forms ...

223
00:26:24,174 --> 00:26:25,174
when warm air rises over cool air?

224
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,594
Stayed up all night
blowing up balloons ... for what?

225
00:26:28,678 --> 00:26:29,762
... and that's how we get lightning.

226
00:26:29,846 --> 00:26:31,263
- That's nice, kid.
- Mr. Fredricksen?

227
00:26:32,516 --> 00:26:34,517
There's a storm coming.
It's starting to get scary.

228
00:26:34,643 --> 00:26:38,270
We're gonna get blown to bits!
We're in big trouble ...

229
00:26:39,689 --> 00:26:42,191
- What are you doing over there?
- Look.

230
00:26:53,828 --> 00:26:55,996
See? Cumulonimbus.

231
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,075
My pack!

232
00:27:37,914 --> 00:27:39,248
Got ya!

233
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,245
I thought you were dead.

234
00:28:21,249 --> 00:28:22,374
What happened?

235
00:28:22,459 --> 00:28:25,878
I steered us. I did.
I steered the house.

236
00:28:25,962 --> 00:28:27,046
Steered us?

237
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,882
After you tied your stuff down,
you took a nap.

238
00:28:29,966 --> 00:28:32,051
So I went ahead
and steered us down here.

239
00:28:32,552 --> 00:28:33,844
Yeah. Sure.

240
00:28:47,108 --> 00:28:48,817
Can't tell where we are.

241
00:28:48,943 --> 00:28:50,903
Oh, we're in South America, all right.

242
00:28:50,987 --> 00:28:54,657
It was a cinch
with my Wilderness Explorer GPS.

243
00:28:54,949 --> 00:28:57,409
- GP ... What?
- My dad gave it to me.

244
00:28:57,494 --> 00:28:59,828
It shows exactly where we are
on the planet.

245
00:29:01,665 --> 00:29:04,667
With this baby, we'll never be lost!

246
00:29:09,297 --> 00:29:10,339
Oops.

247
00:29:11,966 --> 00:29:14,259
We'll get you down, find a bus stop,

248
00:29:14,344 --> 00:29:17,429
you just tell the man
you wanna go back to your mother.

249
00:29:17,514 --> 00:29:21,183
Sure, but I don't think
they have buses in Paradise Falls.

250
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,689
There. That ought to do it.

251
00:29:26,773 --> 00:29:28,607
Here, I'll give you
some change for bus fare.

252
00:29:28,692 --> 00:29:31,193
No, I'll just use
my city bus pass.

253
00:29:32,028 --> 00:29:34,947
Whoa. That's gonna be
like a billion transfers ...

254
00:29:35,031 --> 00:29:36,699
to get back to my house.

255
00:29:43,206 --> 00:29:46,125
Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer?

256
00:29:46,209 --> 00:29:50,045
Well, we're up pretty high.
Could take hours to get down.

257
00:29:52,006 --> 00:29:54,466
That thing was ... building or something.

258
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,970
What was that, Mr. Fredricksen?

259
00:29:58,054 --> 00:30:00,389
We can't be close to the ground yet.

260
00:30:09,524 --> 00:30:12,234
Wait! Wait, no, don't! Don't, don't!

261
00:30:13,069 --> 00:30:15,028
Wait, wait. Wait!

262
00:30:20,535 --> 00:30:23,203
- Russell, hang on! Hey!
- Whoa! Whoa!

263
00:30:30,712 --> 00:30:33,213
Aarrgggghhhhh!

264
00:30:33,423 --> 00:30:34,923
- Walk back. Walk back.
- Okay.

265
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,842
Come on. Come on.

266
00:30:49,397 --> 00:30:52,274
Where ... Where are we?

267
00:30:52,609 --> 00:30:57,112
This doesn't look like the city
or the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen.

268
00:30:59,574 --> 00:31:01,950
Don't worry, Ellie. I got it.

269
00:31:27,227 --> 00:31:28,769
There it is.

270
00:31:56,798 --> 00:31:59,341
Ellie, it's so beautiful.

271
00:32:01,636 --> 00:32:03,262
We made it.

272
00:32:03,346 --> 00:32:08,100
We made it! Russell! We could float
right over there! Climb up. Climb up!

273
00:32:08,184 --> 00:32:09,601
You mean, assist you?

274
00:32:09,686 --> 00:32:11,937
- Yeah, yeah. Whatever.
- Okay. I'll climb up.

275
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:19,695
- Watch it!
- Sorry.

276
00:32:26,995 --> 00:32:31,164
Now, when you get up there,
go ahead and hoist me up!

277
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:33,500
Got it?

278
00:32:37,505 --> 00:32:39,298
You on the porch yet?

279
00:32:46,055 --> 00:32:47,723
What? That's it?

280
00:32:48,182 --> 00:32:53,395
I came all this way just to get stuck
at the wrong end of this rock pile?

281
00:32:55,064 --> 00:32:56,148
Great.

282
00:33:00,069 --> 00:33:04,907
Hey, if I could assist you over there,
would you sign off on my badge?

283
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:10,162
- What are you talking about?
- We could walk your house to the falls.

284
00:33:10,246 --> 00:33:13,832
- Walk it?
- Yeah! After all, we weigh it down.

285
00:33:13,917 --> 00:33:17,252
We could walk it right over there.
Like a parade balloon.

286
00:33:21,424 --> 00:33:24,843
Now, we're gonna walk
to the falls quickly and quietly ...

287
00:33:24,928 --> 00:33:27,554
with no rap music or flash dancing.
- Uh-huh.

288
00:33:27,847 --> 00:33:32,434
We have three days, at best, before
the helium leaks out of those balloons.

289
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,020
And if we're not at the falls
when that happens ...

290
00:33:35,104 --> 00:33:37,439
- Sand.
... we're not getting to the falls.

291
00:33:37,523 --> 00:33:39,399
I found sand!

292
00:33:40,276 --> 00:33:43,946
Don't you worry, Ellie.
We'll get our house over there.

293
00:33:48,451 --> 00:33:50,953
This is fun already, isn't it?

294
00:33:51,287 --> 00:33:54,915
By the time we get there,
you're gonna feel so assisted.

295
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:58,627
Oh, Mr. Fredricksen,
if we happen to get separated,

296
00:33:58,753 --> 00:34:00,879
use the Wilderness Explorer call.

297
00:34:00,964 --> 00:34:02,965
Caw, caw! Raar!

298
00:34:04,217 --> 00:34:06,885
Wait. Why are we going
to Paradise Falls again?

299
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:09,054
Hey, let's play a game.

300
00:34:09,138 --> 00:34:12,391
It's called
"see who can be quiet the longest."

301
00:34:12,475 --> 00:34:15,310
Cool!
My mom loves that game!

302
00:35:17,707 --> 00:35:19,166
Darn thing!

303
00:35:21,044 --> 00:35:22,878
Come on, Russell.
Would you hurry it up?

304
00:35:22,962 --> 00:35:27,215
I'm tired. And my knee hurts.

305
00:35:27,467 --> 00:35:28,842
Which knee?

306
00:35:29,469 --> 00:35:33,889
My elbow hurts,
and I have to go to the bathroom.

307
00:35:34,015 --> 00:35:36,725
I asked you about that five minutes ago.

308
00:35:36,851 --> 00:35:40,020
Well, I didn't have to go then!

309
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:46,485
I don't wanna walk anymore.
Can we stop?

310
00:35:46,569 --> 00:35:49,654
Russell, if you don't hurry up,
the tigers will eat you.

311
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:54,201
There are no tigers in South America.
Zoology.

312
00:35:55,745 --> 00:35:59,498
Oh, for the love of Pete! Go on into
the bushes and do your business.

313
00:35:59,582 --> 00:36:01,750
Okay! Here! Hold my stuff.

314
00:36:04,003 --> 00:36:06,379
I've always wanted to try this.

315
00:36:10,218 --> 00:36:11,593
Mr. Fredricksen,

316
00:36:11,677 --> 00:36:14,679
am I supposed to dig the hole
before or after?

317
00:36:15,932 --> 00:36:17,349
None of my concern!

318
00:36:18,726 --> 00:36:20,936
Oh. It's before!

319
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,604
Bah!
La la la la la!

320
00:36:26,025 --> 00:36:27,067
Huh?

321
00:36:28,694 --> 00:36:30,362
Tracks?

322
00:36:31,531 --> 00:36:32,697
Snipe.

323
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:38,245
Here, snipe. Come on out, snipe.

324
00:36:39,413 --> 00:36:41,039
Snipe.

325
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:43,208
Huh?

326
00:36:59,892 --> 00:37:03,562
Ha! Gotcha!
Don't be afraid, little snipe.

327
00:37:03,646 --> 00:37:08,316
I am a Wilderness Explorer,
so I'm a friend to all of nature.

328
00:37:08,901 --> 00:37:10,610
Want some more?

329
00:37:13,072 --> 00:37:17,284
Hi, boy. Don't eat it all.
Come on out.

330
00:37:19,162 --> 00:37:23,832
Come on. Come on.
Don't be afraid, little snipe.

331
00:37:24,584 --> 00:37:28,587
Nice snipe. Good little snipe.
Nice ...

332
00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:31,590
Giant snipe.

333
00:37:36,137 --> 00:37:39,514
- I found the snipe!
- Oh! Did you?

334
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,142
- Are they tall?
- Oh, yes, they're very tall.

335
00:37:42,643 --> 00:37:45,270
- Do they have a lot of colors?
- They do, indeed!

336
00:37:45,771 --> 00:37:49,107
- Do they like chocolate?
- Oh, yes ... chocolate?

337
00:37:52,028 --> 00:37:54,696
- Gah! What is that thing?
- It's a snipe!

338
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,781
There's no such thing as a snipe!

339
00:37:56,866 --> 00:37:59,618
- But you said snipes eat your ... Whoa!
- Hey!

340
00:38:02,038 --> 00:38:03,705
Go on! Get out of here! Go on!

341
00:38:07,793 --> 00:38:10,337
Whoa!

342
00:38:11,214 --> 00:38:12,631
Whoa!

343
00:38:14,675 --> 00:38:15,717
Careful, Russell!

344
00:38:15,843 --> 00:38:19,721
Hey, look, Mr. Fredricksen.
It likes me. Whoa!

345
00:38:20,223 --> 00:38:23,058
- Russell!
- No, stop! That tickles.

346
00:38:23,893 --> 00:38:26,311
Get out of here! Go on! Get!

347
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:38,490
Uh-oh. No, no, no! Kevin!
It's okay. Mr. Fredricksen is nice.

348
00:38:38,908 --> 00:38:41,743
- Kevin?
- Yeah. That's his name I just gave him.

349
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:47,082
Beat it! Vamoose! Scram!
Hey! That's mine!

350
00:38:52,088 --> 00:38:53,588
Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here!

351
00:38:54,757 --> 00:38:56,341
Go on! Beat it!

352
00:39:01,389 --> 00:39:02,931
Can we keep him? Please?

353
00:39:03,015 --> 00:39:06,935
I'll get the food for him. I'll walk him.
I'll change his newspapers.

354
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:08,103
No.

355
00:39:09,438 --> 00:39:13,441
"An Explorer is a friend to all,
be it plants or fish or tiny mole."

356
00:39:13,776 --> 00:39:16,278
- That doesn't even rhyme.
- Yeah, it does.

357
00:39:17,113 --> 00:39:19,281
- Hey, look. Kevin.
- What?

358
00:39:20,574 --> 00:39:23,451
Get down!
You're not allowed up there!

359
00:39:26,038 --> 00:39:28,290
You come down here right now!

360
00:39:31,377 --> 00:39:32,460
Sheesh!

361
00:39:32,586 --> 00:39:34,629
Can you believe this, Ellie?

362
00:39:34,755 --> 00:39:35,797
Ellie?

363
00:39:36,799 --> 00:39:39,551
Hey, Ellie! Could I keep the bird?

364
00:39:40,636 --> 00:39:42,470
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

365
00:39:43,222 --> 00:39:44,889
She said for you to let me.

366
00:39:44,974 --> 00:39:46,808
But I told him no. I told you no!

367
00:39:47,143 --> 00:39:48,310
N-O.

368
00:40:00,823 --> 00:40:02,490
I see you back there.

369
00:40:04,493 --> 00:40:08,330
Go on! Get out of here! Shoo!
Go annoy someone else for a while.

370
00:40:08,414 --> 00:40:09,998
Hey, are you okay over there?

371
00:40:14,003 --> 00:40:16,254
Uh ... Hello?

372
00:40:20,593 --> 00:40:21,634
Oh!

373
00:40:21,844 --> 00:40:24,429
Hello, sir! Thank goodness.

374
00:40:24,513 --> 00:40:26,931
It's nice to know
someone else is up here.

375
00:40:27,016 --> 00:40:28,808
I can smell you.

376
00:40:29,477 --> 00:40:32,520
What? You can smell us?

377
00:40:34,273 --> 00:40:35,982
I can smell you.

378
00:40:43,282 --> 00:40:44,366
Hey.

379
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,868
You were talking to a rock.

380
00:40:48,371 --> 00:40:50,038
Hey, that one looks like a turtle.

381
00:40:50,122 --> 00:40:53,124
Look at that one!
That one looks like a dog.

382
00:40:54,543 --> 00:40:56,544
- It is a dog!
- What?

383
00:40:57,463 --> 00:41:00,548
We're not allowed to have dogs
in my apartment.

384
00:41:02,176 --> 00:41:04,219
Hey, I like dogs.

385
00:41:04,345 --> 00:41:05,970
We have your dog!

386
00:41:06,389 --> 00:41:08,390
- Whoa!
- Wonder who he belongs to.

387
00:41:08,516 --> 00:41:12,060
Sit, boy. Hey, look, he's trained.
Shake.

388
00:41:12,395 --> 00:41:13,478
Uh-huh.

389
00:41:13,562 --> 00:41:14,562
- Speak.
- Hi, there.

390
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:18,566
Did that dog just say "Hi, there"?

391
00:41:18,692 --> 00:41:19,859
Oh, yes.

392
00:41:20,569 --> 00:41:23,988
My name is Dug.
I have just met you, and I love you.

393
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:28,410
My master made me this collar.
He is a good and smart master,

394
00:41:28,536 --> 00:41:32,038
and he made me this collar
so that I may talk. Squirrel!

395
00:41:33,916 --> 00:41:35,250
My master is good and smart.

396
00:41:35,376 --> 00:41:36,418
It's not possible.

397
00:41:36,544 --> 00:41:39,003
Oh, it is,
because my master is smart.

398
00:41:39,088 --> 00:41:41,089
- Cool! What do these do, boy?
- Hey, would you ...

399
00:41:42,341 --> 00:41:43,425
I use that collar ...

400
00:41:44,718 --> 00:41:46,928
to talk with.
I would be happy if you stopped.

401
00:41:47,054 --> 00:41:50,432
Russell, don't touch that!
It could be radioactive or something!

402
00:41:50,558 --> 00:41:51,850
I am a great tracker.

403
00:41:51,934 --> 00:41:55,019
My pack sent me on a special mission
all by myself.

404
00:41:55,104 --> 00:41:56,187
Have you seen a bird?

405
00:41:56,272 --> 00:41:58,523
I want to find one,
and I've been on the scent.

406
00:41:58,607 --> 00:42:00,775
I am a great tracker.
Did I mention that?

407
00:42:02,278 --> 00:42:03,611
Hey, that is the bird.

408
00:42:03,737 --> 00:42:06,614
I have never seen one up close,
but this is the bird.

409
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,200
May I take your bird back to camp
as my prisoner?

410
00:42:09,285 --> 00:42:13,288
Yes, yes, take it. And on the way,
learn how to bark like a real dog.

411
00:42:13,414 --> 00:42:14,456
I can bark.

412
00:42:15,708 --> 00:42:16,791
And here's howling.

413
00:42:20,963 --> 00:42:23,548
Can we keep him?
Please, please, please!

414
00:42:23,632 --> 00:42:26,801
- No.
- But it's a talking dog!

415
00:42:26,927 --> 00:42:30,472
It's just a weird trick or something.
Let's get to the falls.

416
00:42:30,598 --> 00:42:31,973
Please be my prisoner.

417
00:42:32,391 --> 00:42:34,642
Oh, please, oh,
please be my prisoner!

418
00:42:37,313 --> 00:42:40,648
Oh! Here it is.
I picked up the bird's scent!

419
00:42:40,733 --> 00:42:43,067
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
What is this?

420
00:42:43,402 --> 00:42:44,986
Chocolate. I smell chocolate.

421
00:42:45,112 --> 00:42:49,574
I'm getting prunes and denture cream!
Who are they?

422
00:42:50,075 --> 00:42:51,993
Oh, man,
Master will not be pleased.

423
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:55,121
We better tell him someone
took the bird. Right, Alpha?

424
00:42:56,832 --> 00:42:57,916
No.

425
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,835
Soon enough the bird
will be ours yet again.

426
00:43:01,337 --> 00:43:03,004
Find the scent, my compadres,

427
00:43:03,088 --> 00:43:04,839
and you too shall
have much rewardings ...

428
00:43:04,965 --> 00:43:07,675
from Master for the toil factor
you wage.

429
00:43:08,177 --> 00:43:11,429
Hey, Alpha, I think there's
something wrong with your collar.

430
00:43:11,514 --> 00:43:12,764
You must've bumped it.

431
00:43:12,848 --> 00:43:15,141
Yeah, your voice sounds funny!

432
00:43:18,687 --> 00:43:23,024
Beta! Gamma!
Mayhaps you desire to ... Squirrel!

433
00:43:25,027 --> 00:43:27,111
Mayhaps you desire
to challenge the ranking ...

434
00:43:27,196 --> 00:43:29,781
that I have been assigned
by my strength and cunning.

435
00:43:29,865 --> 00:43:33,660
No, no, no. But maybe Dug would.
You might wanna ask him.

436
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:39,582
Yeah. I wonder if he's found the
bird on his very special mission.

437
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:41,751
Do not mention Dug
to me at this time.

438
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:47,090
His fool's errand will keep him
most occupied. Most occupied indeed.

439
00:43:49,134 --> 00:43:52,220
Do you not agree with that
which I am saying to you now?

440
00:43:52,304 --> 00:43:56,599
Sure, but the second Master finds
out you sent Dug out by himself,

441
00:43:56,684 --> 00:43:58,268
none of us will get a treat.

442
00:43:58,894 --> 00:44:01,479
You are wise,
my trusted lieutenant.

443
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:05,858
This is Alpha calling Dug.
Come in, Dug.

444
00:44:06,193 --> 00:44:08,778
Hi, Alpha.
Hey, your voice sounds funny.

445
00:44:08,862 --> 00:44:11,948
I know, I know!
Have you seen the bird?

446
00:44:12,032 --> 00:44:14,784
Why, yes.
The bird is my prisoner now.

447
00:44:14,868 --> 00:44:16,327
Yeah, right!

448
00:44:18,372 --> 00:44:20,123
Impossible! Where are you?

449
00:44:20,207 --> 00:44:21,624
I am here with the bird,

450
00:44:21,709 --> 00:44:24,460
and I will bring it back,
and then you will like me.

451
00:44:24,545 --> 00:44:26,963
- Gotta go.
- Hey, Dug, who you talking to?

452
00:44:27,047 --> 00:44:28,965
- No, wait, wait!
- What's Dug doing?

453
00:44:29,049 --> 00:44:30,883
Why's he with
that small mailman?

454
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:32,594
Where are they?

455
00:44:35,014 --> 00:44:36,973
There he is. Come on!

456
00:44:41,604 --> 00:44:44,314
Oh, please, oh, please,
oh, please be my prisoner.

457
00:44:44,398 --> 00:44:45,815
Dug, stop bothering Kevin!

458
00:44:45,899 --> 00:44:47,817
That man there says
I can take the bird,

459
00:44:49,236 --> 00:44:50,653
and I love that man there
like he is my master.

460
00:44:50,738 --> 00:44:51,821
I am not your master!

461
00:44:51,905 --> 00:44:53,448
I am warning you
once again, bird.

462
00:44:53,532 --> 00:44:55,533
- Hey! Quit it!
- I am jumping on you now, bird.

463
00:44:55,618 --> 00:44:57,910
Russell, at this rate,
we'll never get to the falls.

464
00:44:57,995 --> 00:44:59,329
Here, bird.

465
00:45:07,296 --> 00:45:09,213
I am nobody's master, got it?

466
00:45:09,298 --> 00:45:11,758
I don't want you here,
and I don't want you here!

467
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:13,134
I'm stuck with you!

468
00:45:13,218 --> 00:45:15,887
And if you two don't clear out of here
by the time I count to three ...

469
00:45:15,971 --> 00:45:18,514
A ball! Oh, boy, oh, boy!
A ball!

470
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:22,018
Ball? Yeah, yeah? You want it, boy?

471
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:23,978
Huh? Huh? Yeah. Yeah?

472
00:45:24,063 --> 00:45:26,105
Yes, I do!
I do ever so want the ball.

473
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,649
- Go get it!
- Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

474
00:45:27,733 --> 00:45:29,567
I will get it and then bring it back!

475
00:45:29,652 --> 00:45:31,194
Quick, Russell.
Give me some chocolate.

476
00:45:31,278 --> 00:45:33,321
- Why?
- Just give it to me!

477
00:45:33,781 --> 00:45:35,156
Bird. Bird!

478
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:39,327
Come on, Russell.

479
00:45:39,662 --> 00:45:42,038
Wait. Wait, Mr. Fredricksen.

480
00:45:47,252 --> 00:45:48,961
What are we doing?

481
00:45:53,759 --> 00:45:58,179
Hey, we're pretty far now.
Kevin's gonna miss me.

482
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:05,812
I think that did the trick.

483
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:09,065
Hi, Master.

484
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,234
Afternoon.

485
00:46:36,677 --> 00:46:39,929
Well, thanks for keeping us
dry anyway, Ellie.

486
00:46:40,013 --> 00:46:41,889
Which one's the front?

487
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:44,767
Oh, boy.

488
00:46:44,852 --> 00:46:48,563
Is this step three or step five?

489
00:46:50,858 --> 00:46:52,108
There.

490
00:46:56,071 --> 00:46:58,406
All done! That's for you.

491
00:47:04,747 --> 00:47:05,830
Oh ...

492
00:47:05,914 --> 00:47:07,415
Tents are hard.

493
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:13,212
Wait. Aren't you super wilderness guy,
with the GPMs and the badges?

494
00:47:13,922 --> 00:47:18,009
Yeah, but can I tell you a secret?

495
00:47:18,594 --> 00:47:21,429
- No.
- All right. Here it goes.

496
00:47:22,014 --> 00:47:25,475
I never actually built a tent before.
There, I said it.

497
00:47:26,059 --> 00:47:28,186
You've been camping before,
haven't you?

498
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:30,730
Well, never outside.

499
00:47:31,231 --> 00:47:34,650
Well, why didn't you ask your dad
how to build a tent?

500
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:37,945
I don't think he wants
to talk about this stuff.

501
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:40,656
Well, why don't you try him sometime.
Maybe he'll surprise you.

502
00:47:40,741 --> 00:47:43,075
Well, he's away a lot.
I don't see him much.

503
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,786
He's gotta be home sometime.

504
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:49,123
Well, I call, but Phyllis told me
I bug him too much.

505
00:47:49,208 --> 00:47:52,627
Phyllis? You call your own mother
by her first name?

506
00:47:53,086 --> 00:47:54,879
Phyllis isn't my mom.

507
00:47:57,132 --> 00:47:58,174
Oh.

508
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:09,435
But he promised he'd come to
my Explorer ceremony ...

509
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,313
to pin on my
'Assisting the Elderly' badge.

510
00:48:13,607 --> 00:48:16,526
So, he can show me
about tents then, right?

511
00:48:23,075 --> 00:48:25,701
Hey, why don't you get some sleep?

512
00:48:25,994 --> 00:48:29,622
Don't wanna wake up
the traveling flea circus.

513
00:48:31,667 --> 00:48:33,167
Mr. Fredricksen?

514
00:48:33,252 --> 00:48:36,128
Dug says he wants
to take Kevin prisoner.

515
00:48:37,005 --> 00:48:38,965
We have to protect him.

516
00:48:41,176 --> 00:48:43,219
Can Kevin go with us?

517
00:48:44,847 --> 00:48:46,764
All right, he can come.

518
00:48:47,432 --> 00:48:49,559
Promise you won't leave him?

519
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,186
- Yeah.
- Cross your heart?

520
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:02,280
Cross my heart.

521
00:49:07,828 --> 00:49:10,329
What have I got myself into, Ellie?

522
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,271
Morning, sweetheart.

523
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:39,025
We better get moving.

524
00:49:41,737 --> 00:49:43,070
Bird's gone.

525
00:49:43,155 --> 00:49:46,741
Maybe Russell won't notice.
All right, everybody up!

526
00:49:47,576 --> 00:49:52,038
Where's Kevin? He's wandered off!
Kevin! Dug, find Kevin!

527
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:55,958
Find the bird, find the bird!
Hi, hi. Point!

528
00:49:56,043 --> 00:49:57,919
Look. There he is!

529
00:50:00,339 --> 00:50:01,505
Point!

530
00:50:01,882 --> 00:50:05,551
Hey! That's my food!
Get off my roof!

531
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:06,886
Yeah, get off of his ...

532
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:13,559
What is it doing?

533
00:50:13,644 --> 00:50:16,062
The bird is calling to her babies.

534
00:50:17,189 --> 00:50:18,648
Her babies.

535
00:50:20,025 --> 00:50:21,567
Kevin's a girl?

536
00:50:23,946 --> 00:50:26,697
Her house is over there
in those twisty rocks.

537
00:50:27,783 --> 00:50:31,369
She has been gathering food for
her babies and must get back to them.

538
00:50:32,621 --> 00:50:34,288
Wait. Kevin's just leaving?

539
00:50:36,875 --> 00:50:39,377
But you promised to protect her.

540
00:50:39,461 --> 00:50:42,755
Her babies need her.
We gotta make sure they're together!

541
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:45,883
Sorry, Russell.
We've lost enough time already.

542
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:48,469
Yeah.

543
00:50:56,144 --> 00:50:58,854
This was her favorite chocolate.

544
00:50:59,481 --> 00:51:03,526
Because you sent her away,
there's more for you.

545
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,237
Huh?

546
00:51:06,321 --> 00:51:07,488
Kevin?

547
00:51:26,174 --> 00:51:29,093
Where's the bird?
You said you had the bird.

548
00:51:29,177 --> 00:51:30,386
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

549
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:33,514
Since I have said that,
I can see how you would think that.

550
00:51:33,598 --> 00:51:36,684
- Where is it?
- Uh ... Tomorrow.

551
00:51:36,768 --> 00:51:40,646
Come back tomorrow, and then
I will again have the bird. Yes.

552
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:45,568
You lost it! Why do I
not have a surprised feeling?

553
00:51:46,111 --> 00:51:49,363
Well, at least you now have led us
to the small mailman ...

554
00:51:49,448 --> 00:51:51,949
and the one who smells of prunes.

555
00:51:53,618 --> 00:51:56,120
Master will be most pleased
we have found them ...

556
00:51:56,204 --> 00:51:59,123
and will ask of them many questions.
Come!

557
00:51:59,207 --> 00:52:02,752
Wait. We're not going with you!
We're going to the falls!

558
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:06,380
Get away from me!

559
00:52:10,177 --> 00:52:11,510
Get down!

560
00:53:05,857 --> 00:53:06,941
Stay!

561
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:17,743
You came here in that?

562
00:53:18,245 --> 00:53:19,495
Uh, yeah.

563
00:53:20,247 --> 00:53:24,083
In a house? A floating house?

564
00:53:32,592 --> 00:53:35,427
That is the darnedest thing
I've ever seen.

565
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:38,556
You're not after my bird, are you?

566
00:53:38,974 --> 00:53:41,517
But if you needed to borrow
a cup of sugar,

567
00:53:41,601 --> 00:53:43,853
I'd be happy to oblige.

568
00:53:47,232 --> 00:53:49,817
Well, this is all a misunderstanding.

569
00:53:50,277 --> 00:53:52,111
My dogs made a mistake.

570
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:55,114
Wait. Are you Charles Muntz?

571
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:57,825
Yeah, well, yes.

572
00:53:57,909 --> 00:54:00,035
THE Charles Muntz?

573
00:54:00,412 --> 00:54:02,329
"Adventure is out there!"

574
00:54:02,414 --> 00:54:05,958
It's really him!
That's Charles Muntz!

575
00:54:06,251 --> 00:54:09,628
- It is? Who's Charles Muntz?
- Him!

576
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:11,547
- Yes! Yes! That's him!
- I'm Carl Fredricksen.

577
00:54:11,631 --> 00:54:14,466
My wife and I,
we were your biggest fans.

578
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:16,302
Oh, well.
You're a man of good taste.

579
00:54:18,638 --> 00:54:20,806
Now, you must be tired. Hungry?

580
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:21,932
Uh-huh.

581
00:54:22,142 --> 00:54:23,475
Now, attention, everyone!

582
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:27,396
These people are no longer intruders!
They are our guests.

583
00:54:29,608 --> 00:54:31,984
Follow me.
I like you temporarily.

584
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:33,777
You do smell like prunes.

585
00:54:33,862 --> 00:54:34,904
Whoa!

586
00:54:36,531 --> 00:54:37,656
I will not bite you.

587
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:40,201
The small mailman
smells like chocolate.

588
00:54:41,453 --> 00:54:43,621
I'm sorry about the dogs.

589
00:54:43,705 --> 00:54:46,707
- Hope they weren't too rough on you.
- We weren't.

590
00:54:46,791 --> 00:54:50,252
Go ahead and moor
your airship right next to mine.

591
00:54:55,884 --> 00:54:59,470
We're not actually going inside
the Spirit of Adventure itself?

592
00:54:59,554 --> 00:55:00,596
Oh ...

593
00:55:00,847 --> 00:55:02,431
Would you like to?

594
00:55:02,515 --> 00:55:03,766
Would I?

595
00:55:05,894 --> 00:55:07,770
Wait up, Mr. Muntz.

596
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,147
Jiminy Cricket.

597
00:55:10,482 --> 00:55:12,524
- Not you.
- What do we do with Dug?

598
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:16,362
He has lost the bird.
Put him in the 'Cone of Shame'.

599
00:55:21,326 --> 00:55:23,661
I do not like the 'Cone of Shame'.

600
00:55:25,038 --> 00:55:29,291
Well, most of the collection
is housed in the world's top museums,

601
00:55:29,376 --> 00:55:33,128
New York, Munich, London.
Of course, I kept the best for myself.

602
00:55:33,505 --> 00:55:36,340
Did you ever! Will you look at that?

603
00:55:36,424 --> 00:55:38,926
Oh, yes, the Arsinoitherium.

604
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:41,720
Beast charged
while I was brushing my teeth.

605
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:44,556
Used my shaving kit to bring him down.

606
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:46,350
Oh, yeah. Well, surprise me.

607
00:55:46,434 --> 00:55:48,852
Only way to get it out
of Ethiopia at the time ...

608
00:55:48,937 --> 00:55:51,897
was to have it declared
as dental equipment.

609
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:55,693
Oh, my gosh!
The giant Somalian leopard tortoise!

610
00:55:55,777 --> 00:55:58,654
Oh, you recognize it. I'm impressed.

611
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:01,031
That's an interesting story there.

612
00:56:01,449 --> 00:56:03,158
Excellent choice.

613
00:56:03,243 --> 00:56:07,037
I found it on safari with Roosevelt.

614
00:56:07,122 --> 00:56:11,000
He and I fell into a habit of
playing "gin rummy" in the evenings,

615
00:56:11,084 --> 00:56:12,918
and did he cheat!

616
00:56:13,003 --> 00:56:15,254
Oh, he was horrible.

617
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,507
Master, dinner is ready.

618
00:56:18,842 --> 00:56:20,968
Oh, dear. Broken translator.

619
00:56:21,052 --> 00:56:25,639
It's that loose wire again.
There you go, big fella.

620
00:56:25,724 --> 00:56:27,099
Thank you, Master.

621
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:29,393
I liked his other voice.

622
00:56:30,603 --> 00:56:33,897
Well, dinner is served.
Right this way.

623
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:38,193
So, how are things stateside, huh?

624
00:56:38,278 --> 00:56:40,696
Almost tempted to go back a few times,

625
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:44,366
but I have unfinished work here.

626
00:56:44,451 --> 00:56:47,453
Please. I hope you're hungry,

627
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:51,832
because Epsilon is the finest chef
I've ever had.

628
00:56:56,629 --> 00:56:59,631
Oh, Epsilon, you've done it again!

629
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:00,758
Yes!

630
00:57:02,302 --> 00:57:04,303
Hey! Hey!

631
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:07,765
Oh, my Ellie would've loved all this.

632
00:57:07,849 --> 00:57:10,309
You know, it's because of you
she had this dream ...

633
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:13,062
to come down here
and live by Paradise Falls.

634
00:57:13,146 --> 00:57:15,689
I'm honored. And now you've made it.

635
00:57:15,774 --> 00:57:18,233
You're sure we're not a bother?
I'd hate to impose.

636
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:22,363
No, no. It's a pleasure to have guests,
a real treat.

637
00:57:22,447 --> 00:57:23,864
- Treat! Where's the treat!
- Treat!

638
00:57:25,075 --> 00:57:26,992
No, no. Quiet!
Calm down, calm down.

639
00:57:27,077 --> 00:57:28,494
- I want a treat! I want a treat!
- Hey!

640
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:30,162
I shouldn't have used that word.

641
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:32,998
Having guests is a delight.

642
00:57:33,083 --> 00:57:36,960
More often I get thieves come
to steal what's rightfully mine.

643
00:57:37,045 --> 00:57:38,087
No!

644
00:57:40,632 --> 00:57:43,092
They called me a fraud, those ...

645
00:57:45,678 --> 00:57:49,598
But once I bring back this creature,
my name will be cleared.

646
00:57:50,517 --> 00:57:52,476
Beautiful, isn't it?

647
00:57:55,146 --> 00:57:57,815
I've spent a lifetime tracking it.

648
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:03,612
Sometimes years go by
between sightings.

649
00:58:04,572 --> 00:58:09,159
I've tried to smoke it out of that
deathly labyrinth where it lives.

650
00:58:09,994 --> 00:58:11,662
You can't go in after it.

651
00:58:12,163 --> 00:58:14,373
Once in, there's no way out.

652
00:58:14,999 --> 00:58:16,959
I've lost so many dogs.

653
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:24,133
And here they come, these bandits,
and think the bird is theirs to take.

654
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:29,847
But they soon find that this mountain
is a very dangerous place.

655
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,685
Hey, that looks like Kevin.

656
00:58:36,729 --> 00:58:39,565
- Kevin?
- Yeah, that's my new giant bird pet.

657
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:41,733
I trained it to follow us.

658
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:45,028
Follow you? It's impossible. How?

659
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:47,948
- She likes chocolate.
- Chocolate?

660
00:58:48,366 --> 00:58:51,952
Yeah. I gave her some of my chocolate.
She goes gaga for it.

661
00:58:52,036 --> 00:58:54,955
But it ran off. It's gone now.

662
00:59:01,796 --> 00:59:06,383
You know, Carl, these people
who pass through here,

663
00:59:06,468 --> 00:59:09,052
they all tell pretty good stories.

664
00:59:11,764 --> 00:59:14,016
A surveyor making a map.

665
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:18,145
A botanist cataloguing plants.

666
00:59:21,232 --> 00:59:26,904
An old man taking his house
to Paradise Falls.

667
00:59:33,453 --> 00:59:37,581
I mean, that's the best one yet.
I can't wait to hear how it ends.

668
00:59:47,217 --> 00:59:50,844
Well, it's been a wonderful evening,
but we better be going.

669
00:59:50,929 --> 00:59:52,262
Oh, you're not leaving.

670
00:59:52,347 --> 00:59:55,974
We don't want to take advantage
of your hospitality.

671
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:59,269
- Come on, Russell.
- But we haven't even had dessert yet.

672
00:59:59,354 --> 01:00:02,272
The boy's right.
You haven't had dessert.

673
01:00:02,607 --> 01:00:06,985
Epsilon here makes
a delicious cherries jubilee.

674
01:00:08,196 --> 01:00:11,281
Oh, you really must stay. I insist.

675
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:14,284
We have so much more to talk about.

676
01:00:18,623 --> 01:00:19,790
Kevin?

677
01:00:27,507 --> 01:00:28,882
It's here.

678
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:32,094
Get them!

679
01:00:34,847 --> 01:00:37,266
- Hurry!
- I am hurrying!

680
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:39,643
Ahhh! They're coming!

681
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:44,356
Master, over here.

682
01:00:59,831 --> 01:01:02,165
Go toward the light, Master!

683
01:01:36,868 --> 01:01:38,327
Get back!

684
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:44,875
Go on, Master!
I will stop the dogs!

685
01:01:46,085 --> 01:01:47,711
Stop, you dogs.

686
01:01:58,598 --> 01:02:00,057
Whoa!

687
01:02:16,074 --> 01:02:17,199
Help!

688
01:02:17,742 --> 01:02:20,702
Help!

689
01:02:22,246 --> 01:02:25,290
Caw, caw! Raar!
Caw, caw! Raar!

690
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,250
Give me your hand!

691
01:02:38,596 --> 01:02:40,305
Hang on to Kevin!

692
01:03:11,879 --> 01:03:13,255
Kevin.

693
01:03:36,988 --> 01:03:40,907
Oh, no, no, no. Kevin. Stay down.

694
01:03:41,826 --> 01:03:46,204
She's hurt real bad.
Can't we help her get home?

695
01:03:57,175 --> 01:03:59,760
All right, but we gotta hurry.

696
01:04:06,392 --> 01:04:07,893
You lost them?

697
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:09,144
No, it was Dug.

698
01:04:09,228 --> 01:04:12,564
Yeah. He's with them.
He helped them escape!

699
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:14,983
Wait.

700
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:17,861
Wait a minute. Dug.

701
01:04:24,494 --> 01:04:25,619
See anything?

702
01:04:25,703 --> 01:04:29,164
No. My pack is not following us.
Boy, they are dumb.

703
01:04:29,457 --> 01:04:30,707
This is crazy.

704
01:04:30,792 --> 01:04:34,377
I finally meet my childhood hero, and
he's trying to kill us. What a joke!

705
01:04:34,462 --> 01:04:35,837
Hey, I know a joke.

706
01:04:35,963 --> 01:04:37,839
A squirrel walks up to a tree
and says,

707
01:04:37,965 --> 01:04:41,134
"I forgot to store acorns
for winter and now I am dead."

708
01:04:41,219 --> 01:04:44,554
Ha! It is funny
because the squirrel gets dead.

709
01:04:48,142 --> 01:04:49,893
Careful, Russell.

710
01:04:49,977 --> 01:04:51,561
You okay, Kevin?

711
01:04:56,651 --> 01:04:58,902
You know what, Mr. Fredricksen?

712
01:04:58,986 --> 01:05:01,863
The wilderness isn't quite
what I expected.

713
01:05:01,989 --> 01:05:03,573
Yeah? How so?

714
01:05:03,908 --> 01:05:06,159
It's kind of wild.

715
01:05:06,577 --> 01:05:09,913
I mean, it's not how they made
it sound in my book.

716
01:05:09,997 --> 01:05:11,915
Get used to that, kid.

717
01:05:11,999 --> 01:05:14,417
My dad made it sound so easy.

718
01:05:14,502 --> 01:05:16,586
He's really good at camping ...

719
01:05:16,671 --> 01:05:19,756
and how to make fire
from rocks and stuff.

720
01:05:19,841 --> 01:05:22,551
He used to come to all
my Sweat Lodge meetings.

721
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:26,513
And afterwards,
we'd go get ice cream at Fentons.

722
01:05:27,014 --> 01:05:29,766
I always get chocolate
and he gets butter brickle.

723
01:05:29,851 --> 01:05:32,811
Then we sit on this one curb
right outside,

724
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:36,731
and I'll count all the blue cars
and he counts all the red ones,

725
01:05:36,858 --> 01:05:40,402
and whoever gets the most wins.

726
01:05:43,114 --> 01:05:44,906
I like that curb.

727
01:05:48,119 --> 01:05:49,911
That might sound boring,

728
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:54,457
but I think the boring stuff
is the stuff I remember the most.

729
01:06:01,966 --> 01:06:03,800
Look! There it is!

730
01:06:04,552 --> 01:06:07,971
Hey, kid. Hold on, Russell.
Stand still.

731
01:06:18,566 --> 01:06:22,152
Look at that bird go.
Wait up, you overgrown chicken.

732
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:26,907
That's it. Go, Kevin!
Go find your babies!

733
01:06:31,454 --> 01:06:33,288
Run, Kevin! Run!

734
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:37,459
Oh, no!

735
01:06:42,673 --> 01:06:44,925
Russell, give me your knife!

736
01:06:46,928 --> 01:06:48,929
Get away from my bird!

737
01:07:15,206 --> 01:07:16,331
No!

738
01:07:22,964 --> 01:07:24,255
No!

739
01:07:30,638 --> 01:07:33,515
Careful. We'll want her
in good shape for my return.

740
01:07:35,309 --> 01:07:38,228
Let her go! Stop!

741
01:07:42,066 --> 01:07:43,984
Kevin!

742
01:07:57,707 --> 01:07:59,499
You gave away Kevin.

743
01:08:02,336 --> 01:08:05,171
You just gave her away.

744
01:08:07,008 --> 01:08:12,595
This is none of my concern.
I didn't ask for any of this!

745
01:08:15,266 --> 01:08:18,018
Master, it's alright.

746
01:08:18,853 --> 01:08:20,729
I am not your master!

747
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:24,566
And if you hadn't have shown up,
none of this would've happened!

748
01:08:24,692 --> 01:08:26,943
Bad dog! Bad dog!

749
01:08:35,286 --> 01:08:37,370
Now, whether you assist me or not,

750
01:08:37,872 --> 01:08:41,458
I am going to Paradise Falls
if it kills me.

751
01:09:53,614 --> 01:09:57,450
Here. I don't want this anymore.

752
01:13:38,005 --> 01:13:39,172
Russell?

753
01:13:44,178 --> 01:13:45,219
Russell!

754
01:13:45,345 --> 01:13:48,806
I'm gonna help Kevin,
even if you won't!

755
01:13:50,184 --> 01:13:52,185
No, Russell! No!

756
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:04,841
Huh?

757
01:15:04,925 --> 01:15:06,092
Russell?

758
01:15:08,262 --> 01:15:09,387
Dug!

759
01:15:09,596 --> 01:15:14,225
I was hiding under your porch
because I love you. Can I stay?

760
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:16,727
Can you stay?
Well, you're my dog, aren't you?

761
01:15:16,812 --> 01:15:18,146
And I'm your master.

762
01:15:18,272 --> 01:15:19,730
You're my master?

763
01:15:19,815 --> 01:15:21,149
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

764
01:15:21,275 --> 01:15:24,026
Good boy, Dug!
You're a good boy!

765
01:15:49,845 --> 01:15:50,970
Yes!

766
01:15:52,973 --> 01:15:54,807
Don't worry, Kevin. I'll save ...

767
01:16:03,775 --> 01:16:08,779
And they wouldn't believe me.
Just wait till they get a look at you.

768
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:10,114
Master?

769
01:16:10,532 --> 01:16:13,659
- The small mailman has returned.
- What?

770
01:16:14,161 --> 01:16:15,661
Let me go.

771
01:16:17,664 --> 01:16:19,624
Where's your elderly friend?

772
01:16:21,335 --> 01:16:23,544
He's not my friend anymore.

773
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:27,506
Well, if you're here,
Fredricksen can't be far behind.

774
01:16:28,508 --> 01:16:30,676
Where are you keeping Kevin?

775
01:16:31,845 --> 01:16:33,054
Let me go!

776
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:35,348
Scream all you want,
small mailman.

777
01:16:35,474 --> 01:16:37,850
None of your mailman friends
can hear you.

778
01:16:38,518 --> 01:16:42,021
I'll unleash
all my Wilderness Explorer training!

779
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:47,526
Alpha,
Fredricksen's coming back.

780
01:16:47,653 --> 01:16:51,239
Guard that bird. If you see the old man,
you know what to do.

781
01:16:51,365 --> 01:16:54,659
Hey, where are you going?
I'm not finished with you!

782
01:16:54,743 --> 01:16:56,661
Nice talking with you.

783
01:16:59,873 --> 01:17:00,915
Ahhh!

784
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:03,709
Where are you, Fredricksen?

785
01:17:22,229 --> 01:17:23,562
Russell!

786
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:38,744
- Mr. Fredricksen!
- Dug, bring her over!

787
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:43,124
You came back for Kevin!
Let's go get her!

788
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:45,418
I'm getting Kevin. You stay here.

789
01:17:45,544 --> 01:17:46,711
But I wanna help.

790
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:48,087
I don't want your help.

791
01:17:48,213 --> 01:17:49,922
I want you safe.

792
01:17:57,097 --> 01:17:59,432
How do we get past these dogs?

793
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:01,142
Point!

794
01:18:11,611 --> 01:18:12,778
Kevin.

795
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:16,449
Don't worry, Kevin.
We're on our way.

796
01:18:16,950 --> 01:18:20,077
Allow no one to be entering
through these doors.

797
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:23,164
Guard well that bird, my minions.

798
01:18:24,082 --> 01:18:25,499
What do we do now, Dug?

799
01:18:38,805 --> 01:18:40,639
Who wants the ball?

800
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:43,642
- Me! I want it!
- Me! I do!

801
01:18:43,977 --> 01:18:45,353
- I want the ball!
- Give it to me!

802
01:18:45,479 --> 01:18:46,729
Then go get it!

803
01:18:46,813 --> 01:18:49,190
I'm gonna get there first!

804
01:18:49,316 --> 01:18:50,691
Getting the ball!

805
01:18:50,817 --> 01:18:52,276
I got it!

806
01:18:52,652 --> 01:18:53,652
Uh-oh.

807
01:18:57,491 --> 01:19:00,409
I'm sorry, Kevin.
Let's get you out of here.

808
01:19:00,494 --> 01:19:02,495
Master! He's gone!
The old man!

809
01:19:02,621 --> 01:19:03,621
- He's here!

810
01:19:03,705 --> 01:19:05,831
- He's got the bird!
- The bird's gone ...

811
01:19:05,957 --> 01:19:07,958
Calm down! One at a time!

812
01:19:11,463 --> 01:19:14,215
I ... want ... to ... help!

813
01:19:14,341 --> 01:19:15,341
Ha-ha!

814
01:19:24,851 --> 01:19:26,310
- He's in Hall D!
- He's in Hall C!

815
01:19:26,395 --> 01:19:27,853
It's the old man!

816
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:31,273
Does anyone know where they are?

817
01:19:46,832 --> 01:19:49,083
Gray Leader?
Take down the house.

818
01:19:55,841 --> 01:19:57,133
Gray Leader, checking in.

819
01:19:57,217 --> 01:19:58,217
Gray Two, checking in.

820
01:19:58,343 --> 01:19:59,510
Gray Three, checking in.

821
01:20:04,015 --> 01:20:05,349
Target sighted.

822
01:20:13,817 --> 01:20:15,359
Come on, Kevin.

823
01:20:22,659 --> 01:20:23,701
Arrggghh!

824
01:20:30,417 --> 01:20:31,584
Hi.

825
01:20:57,861 --> 01:21:01,197
Any last words, Fredricksen?
Come on! Spit it out!

826
01:21:04,951 --> 01:21:07,203
- Come on.
- Enough!

827
01:21:07,537 --> 01:21:12,249
I am taking that bird back with me.
Alive or dead!

828
01:21:38,568 --> 01:21:40,236
Come on, Kevin.

829
01:21:59,464 --> 01:22:02,424
I will have many enjoyments
from what I am about to do, Dug.

830
01:22:10,809 --> 01:22:12,309
- He wears the 'Cone of Shame'!

831
01:22:12,852 --> 01:22:16,272
What? Do not just continue sitting.
Attack!

832
01:22:19,359 --> 01:22:22,611
No, no! Stop your laughing!
Get this off of me!

833
01:22:22,696 --> 01:22:24,613
Listen, you dog. Sit!

834
01:22:26,199 --> 01:22:27,449
Yes, Alpha.

835
01:22:27,534 --> 01:22:30,160
Alpha? I am not Alpha.
He is ...

836
01:22:30,537 --> 01:22:31,579
Oh!

837
01:22:33,206 --> 01:22:34,915
I can't do it.

838
01:22:37,252 --> 01:22:38,502
- Russell!
- Huh?

839
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:42,089
Caw, caw! Raar!
Caw, caw! Raar!

840
01:22:43,008 --> 01:22:45,509
You leave Mr. Fredricksen alone!

841
01:23:02,235 --> 01:23:04,111
Hey, squirrel!

842
01:23:04,195 --> 01:23:06,196
Squirrel? Where?
Where? Where?

843
01:23:06,281 --> 01:23:07,615
Where's the squirrel?

844
01:23:11,453 --> 01:23:13,120
I hate squirrels.

845
01:23:33,808 --> 01:23:34,892
Dug!

846
01:23:35,393 --> 01:23:36,602
Master!

847
01:23:37,646 --> 01:23:40,981
Russell! Over here! Let's go!

848
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:47,655
Mr. Fredricksen!

849
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:49,865
Go on, Kevin!

850
01:24:04,798 --> 01:24:05,923
No!

851
01:24:20,772 --> 01:24:23,107
Russell! Get out of there!

852
01:24:25,110 --> 01:24:27,236
No! Leave them alone!

853
01:24:42,544 --> 01:24:46,714
Russell, hang on to Kevin!
Don't let go of her!

854
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,884
Kevin! Chocolate!

855
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:15,033
That was cool!

856
01:25:17,078 --> 01:25:21,457
Don't jerk around so much, kid!
Easy, Russell.

857
01:25:23,752 --> 01:25:26,253
Oh, I am ready to not be up high.

858
01:25:49,611 --> 01:25:52,279
Sorry about your house,
Mr. Fredricksen.

859
01:25:54,908 --> 01:25:57,701
You know, it's just a house.

860
01:26:05,752 --> 01:26:07,920
Look at you. You're so soft.

861
01:26:10,507 --> 01:26:12,090
Aw!

862
01:26:12,175 --> 01:26:13,967
I wish I could keep one.

863
01:26:18,348 --> 01:26:20,390
Where's my cane?
I just had it here.

864
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:31,985
You know what? Keep them.
A little gift from me to you.

865
01:26:32,862 --> 01:26:34,404
Bye, Kevin!

866
01:26:43,832 --> 01:26:45,123
Ready?

867
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:46,834
Ready.

868
01:26:57,595 --> 01:26:59,346
And by receiving their badges,

869
01:26:59,430 --> 01:27:04,101
the following Explorers will
graduate to Senior Explorers.

870
01:27:04,477 --> 01:27:08,313
For Extreme Mountaineering Lore.
Congratulations, Jimmy.

871
01:27:08,565 --> 01:27:13,026
For Wild Animal Defensive Arts.
Congratulations, Brandon.

872
01:27:13,528 --> 01:27:15,696
For Assisting the Elderly ...

873
01:27:16,531 --> 01:27:19,700
Uh, Russell,
is there someone that ...

874
01:27:22,453 --> 01:27:25,539
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Old man coming through.

875
01:27:28,376 --> 01:27:29,877
I'm here for him.

876
01:27:30,086 --> 01:27:32,337
Congratulations, Russell. Sir.

877
01:27:35,508 --> 01:27:38,594
Russell, for Assisting the Elderly ...

878
01:27:39,053 --> 01:27:43,265
and for performing above
and beyond the call of duty,

879
01:27:44,225 --> 01:27:48,520
I would like to award you
the highest honor I can bestow.

880
01:27:50,899 --> 01:27:52,649
The Ellie badge.

881
01:27:55,653 --> 01:27:56,737
Wow.

882
01:28:01,451 --> 01:28:03,952
All right,
I think that covers everybody.

883
01:28:04,037 --> 01:28:06,079
So let's give a big Explorer call ...

884
01:28:06,372 --> 01:28:09,875
to our brand new
Senior Wilderness Explorers.

885
01:28:10,126 --> 01:28:11,251
Ready, everybody?

886
01:28:11,336 --> 01:28:12,878
Caw, caw! Raar!
Caw, caw! Raar!

887
01:28:19,928 --> 01:28:21,637
- Blue one.
- Red one.

888
01:28:22,305 --> 01:28:24,097
- Blue one.
- Gray one.

889
01:28:25,058 --> 01:28:27,059
- Red one.
- That's a bike.

890
01:28:27,477 --> 01:28:29,144
It's red, isn't it?

891
01:28:29,228 --> 01:28:31,104
Mr. Fredricksen,
you're cheating.

892
01:28:31,314 --> 01:28:33,106
No, I'm not. Red one.

893
01:28:33,191 --> 01:28:34,983
That's a fire hydrant.

894
01:28:37,111 --> 01:28:39,154
Maybe I need new glasses.

895
01:28:39,489 --> 01:29:02,386
Another blue one.

896
01:34:01,727 --> 01:34:05,939
Adventure is out there.
It's heading our way ...

897
01:34:06,107 --> 01:34:10,110
so grab your scarf and goggles.
Let's fly ...

898
01:34:10,486 --> 01:34:14,781
I've mapped out our journey.
We're up here to stay.

899
01:34:14,865 --> 01:34:19,119
A sunset is our home.
A moonbeam we will own.

900
01:34:19,245 --> 01:34:22,998
My spirit of adventure is you.

901
01:34:23,541 --> 01:34:27,711
Freaks of nature span a globe.
That's too big to deny.

902
01:34:27,795 --> 01:34:32,132
With canine guards we'll travel
there and spit into their eye.

903
01:34:32,633 --> 01:34:36,845
Bang, bang.
Once the smoke has cleared ...

904
01:34:36,929 --> 01:34:40,849
after all the crowds have cheered ...

905
01:34:40,933 --> 01:34:45,437
we'll make it a joint venture
before we're in our dentures.

906
01:34:45,521 --> 01:34:49,149
My spirit of adventure is you.

907
01:35:07,209 --> 01:35:11,504
Adventure is out there.
Let's crack some champagne.

908
01:35:11,589 --> 01:35:15,842
I've hung a hundred heads
on my wall.

909
01:35:15,926 --> 01:35:20,346
To say that I'm traveled
is far too mundane.

910
01:35:20,431 --> 01:35:24,726
Let's grab our aero-fare.
The high-brows will be there.

911
01:35:24,810 --> 01:35:29,064
The spirit of adventure
is something to indenture.

912
01:35:29,148 --> 01:36:44,055
My spirit of adventure is you.
