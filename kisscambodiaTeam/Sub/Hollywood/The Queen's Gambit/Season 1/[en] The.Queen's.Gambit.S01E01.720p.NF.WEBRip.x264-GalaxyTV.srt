1
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:09,541
<i>Mademoiselle?</i>

2
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:11,291
<i>Mademoiselle Harmon, vous êtes là?</i>

3
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:16,500
<i>Mademoiselle?</i>

4
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:24,291
Mademoiselle?

5
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:25,583
I'm coming.

6
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,000
Jesus.

7
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:33,125
Shit!

8
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,958
<i>Je descends, tout de suite.</i>

9
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,000
Yeah.

10
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:48,958
Fuck!

11
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,333
<i>Je vous en prie.</i>

12
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:47,458
<i>Ne regarde pas.</i>

13
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,083
Thank you.

14
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,333
Fuck!

15
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,500
I'm sorry.

16
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,041
<i>What are we supposed to do with her?</i>

17
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,625
<i>They're sending someone.</i>

18
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,875
<i>There's hardly a scratch on her.</i>

19
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,916
<i>It's a goddamn miracle.</i>

20
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,541
I doubt she'll see it that way.

21
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,083
You understand, dear,
your mother's passed on?

22
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,166
You know what that means, don't you?

23
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,250
"Passed on"?

24
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,625
Well…

25
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,833
I'm sure she's gone on to a better place,

26
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,500
and, someday, you'll get to see her again.

27
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,833
<i>"Orphaned by</i>
<i>yesterday's collision on New Circle Road,</i>

28
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,250
<i>Elizabeth Harmon
surveys a troubled future."</i>

29
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:18,166
"Elizabeth, nine years old,
was left without family by the crash."

30
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:22,166
"Her mother, Alice Harmon,
was pronounced dead at the scene."

31
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,000
<i>And the father?</i>

32
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:34,916
Doesn't say.

33
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:40,250
I would guess that,
like most men who live around there,

34
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:44,041
he was yet another victim
of a carefree life.

35
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,541
Poor dear.

36
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,041
Let's welcome her, shall we?

37
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,125
Welcome, Elizabeth.

38
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,916
Good luck to you, dear.

39
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,583
Here we are.

40
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:38,250
This is our chapel,
the domain of Miss Lonsdale.

41
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,583
How do you do, Elizabeth?

42
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,916
I also teach etiquette
to the young ladies.

43
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,833
Mr. Fergussen, this is Elizabeth Harmon.

44
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:51,375
You're all a bunch of fucking cocksuckers!

45
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:52,541
Jolene.

46
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,125
I got it.

47
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,250
Jolene, that mouth
will be the death of you!

48
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:00,541
- Oh, fuck you, you cocksucker.
- You can't yell like that.

49
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:04,041
In there is our classroom.
You'll meet your teachers on Monday.

50
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,250
Two times six.

51
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,166
And this is our day room,
where you will have all your meals,

52
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,541
and enjoy daily socialization.

53
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,958
Good morning, Mrs. Deardorff.

54
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,083
Good morning, girls.

55
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,458
Home sweet home.

56
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,791
Come on, let's get you settled.

57
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:25,208
We have 21 girls here,
and they are all just as sweet as you.

58
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,541
And here is your special place.

59
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,666
- Shoo! Go, go, go.
- Okay.

60
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,833
You can put your clothes down here.

61
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:45,208
And your toothbrush can go right here.

62
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,375
And any other personal items, there.

63
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,083
Oh!

64
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:52,625
Show her to me.

65
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,625
Come on, sit.

66
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,500
I know that, at this moment,
all you're feeling is loss.

67
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:14,458
But after grief brings you low,
prayer and faith will lift you high.

68
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:18,208
High enough for you
to see a new path for yourself.

69
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,500
I think, Elizabeth,

70
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,958
you're going to find
a much different life here.

71
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,458
A better one than you might have had.

72
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:31,541
And I'm sure that you and I
are going to be good friends.

73
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,250
Hmm.

74
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,791
That should do nicely.

75
00:07:58,958 --> 00:07:59,791
Mm-hmm.

76
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,291
I think we'll burn this one.

77
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,166
Get dressed.

78
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:10,958
We have one more stop.

79
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,708
Mr. Fergussen will take good care of you.
I'll see you at dinner.

80
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,583
The green ones are the best.

81
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,583
What are they?

82
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,666
Vitamins.

83
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,625
Magic vitamins.

84
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,416
I were you, I'd save
the green ones up for the night time.

85
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,916
Otherwise, they turn off
right when you need them to turn on.

86
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,958
If you know what I mean.

87
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,083
Hey, what's your name, girl?

88
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,333
- Beth.
- Jolene.

89
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,416
Your mama and daddy dead?

90
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,833
What's the last thing
they said to you before they died?

91
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,375
I ask everybody that.
We get some really fun answers.

92
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,416
Close your eyes.

93
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,041
I don't remember.

94
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,708
Someday, you might.
If you do, you let me know.

95
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,250
Green's to even your disposition.

96
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:38,541
Orange and brown is for building
a strong body. Take 'em both.

97
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:53,833
I thought I told you to wait
and take those vitamins at bedtime.

98
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,208
What is this?

99
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,125
Fish.

100
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,125
Far as we know.

101
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,041
We eat it every Friday.

102
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,541
You gotta eat every bite,

103
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:05,125
or they'll tell Mrs. Deardorff about you,
and you won't get adopted.

104
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,333
<i>Alice, come on, open the door.</i>

105
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:59,583
- It's taken me a whole month to find you.
- Good reason.

106
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:03,000
Whatever this is, whatever you're doing,

107
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,125
it's nuts, even for you.

108
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:08,333
- I don't expect you to understand...
- What I understand

109
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,875
is you're not taking care of yourself.

110
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:21,833
So, we'll take…

111
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,750
Isn't it beautiful?

112
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,625
<i>Let me come in and talk to Lizzie.</i>
<i>Make sure she's okay.</i>

113
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,250
<i>Oh, you think I'd hurt her?</i>

114
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,666
She's happy here.
This is where she belongs.

115
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,708
You honestly believe our daughter
belongs in a trailer

116
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,291
in the middle of nowhere?

117
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,250
Who says she's ours?

118
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,125
- Don't do that, Alice.
- And she doesn't like being called Lizzie.

119
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,625
<i>All right, Alice, you win.</i>

120
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,958
I can't fight with you anymore.

121
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,958
And I can't keep chasing you
around everywhere,

122
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,708
if all you do is run away again.

123
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,791
I'm sorry, Paul.

124
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,625
Once I drive away, I'm not coming back.

125
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,916
Miss Harmon, finished already?

126
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:24,083
Why don't you take the erasers
down to the basement and clean them?

127
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:32,041
You're all fucking cocksuckers,
and you're the biggest one of them all.

128
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:35,250
Never met anyone who liked
the taste of soap as much as you do.

129
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:37,875
Where you going, Harmon?

130
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,166
Good morning, girls.

131
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,750
Good morning, Mrs. Deardorff.

132
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,750
Mary-Sue, aren't you a lucky girl?

133
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,500
You really impressed the Spellmans.

134
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,083
I heard their house is so big.

135
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:28,791
Let's get your suitcase and pack up.
Nicely, like I taught you.

136
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,375
Yeah, the socks first, remember.

137
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,458
Hmm.

138
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,458
That is not fair. She got here after you.

139
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,791
Most of us are lifers.

140
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,208
- Been here a long time.
- Don't forget your headband.

141
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,916
Nobody's gonna come for us now.
We're too old.

142
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,166
And don't dawdle.

143
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,833
- I wish it was me.
- Or too Black.

144
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:55,250
- Maybe someone will come through.
- Someday.

145
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,875
What do you want, child?
You should be in chapel.

146
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,041
What's that game called?

147
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,666
You should be upstairs with the others.

148
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,958
I don't wanna be with the others.

149
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,250
I wanna know what that is you're playing.

150
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,333
It's called chess.

151
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,500
Will you teach me?

152
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,208
I don't play strangers.

153
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,750
- Sweet dreams, ladies.
- Good night, Fergussen.

154
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,833
"Good night, good night!"

155
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,916
"Parting is such sweet sorrow,

156
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,708
so I shall say good night
till it be morrow."

157
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,041
You were right.

158
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,333
The vitamins work better at night.

159
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,500
How many you take?

160
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:21,541
I don't know.

161
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,333
Sometimes I skip a day,
or a bunch of days,

162
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,333
then take two or three.

163
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:30,750
I like the way it feels.

164
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:31,958
I bet you do.

165
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:36,250
You just be careful
you don't get too used to that feeling.

166
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,416
I'm not a stranger.

167
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,416
I live here.

168
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,666
I already know some of it…

169
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,791
From watching.

170
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,625
Girls do not play chess.

171
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:10,791
That one moves up and down,
or back and forth,

172
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,666
all the way, if there's space to move in.

173
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,833
But that one can only go up.

174
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,916
That tall one can go any way it wants.

175
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:28,791
And this one?

176
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,708
On the diagonals.

177
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,291
One square diagonal,
plus one square straight.

178
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,500
Let's play a game.

179
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,458
I play White.

180
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,000
Now or never.

181
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:44,833
That's called the Scholar's Mate.

182
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,458
- How do you do it?
- Not today.

183
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,041
- Show me.
- Not today.

184
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:09,083
<i>That's called the Scholar's Mate.</i>

185
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:11,750
<i>How do you do it?</i>

186
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:00,125
<i>That's called the Scholar's Mate.</i>

187
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,791
You resign now.

188
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:07,250
Resign?

189
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,875
That's right, child.
When you lose the queen that way…

190
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:12,791
You resign.

191
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:17,125
- No.
- Yes, you have resigned the game.

192
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:21,041
- You didn't tell me that in the rules.
- It's not a rule, it's sportsmanship.

193
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:23,458
- I wanna finish.
- No.

194
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,833
- You've got to finish.
- No.

195
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:28,958
You lost.

196
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:32,291
- Please!
- The game is over.

197
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,916
You cocksucker.

198
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:40,708
Get out.

199
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:31,916
Check.

200
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:37,708
Mate.

201
00:27:15,041 --> 00:27:15,958
Morning, cracker.

202
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:31,666
Jolene?

203
00:27:32,541 --> 00:27:33,416
What do you want?

204
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:36,291
I want to know what a cocksucker is.

205
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:39,500
Shit!

206
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:41,000
Okay. Um…

207
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:43,458
Do you know what a cock is?

208
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:45,916
I don't think so.

209
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,125
It's what boys have.

210
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:49,833
The picture in the back
of the health book, it's like a thumb.

211
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:50,875
Well, honey,

212
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:54,375
girls like to suck on that thumb.

213
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,208
Do you?

214
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:58,500
Haven't tried one yet.

215
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:05,083
Isn't that where they pee?

216
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:07,333
I expect it wipes clean.

217
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:15,666
<i>You should have green,</i>
<i>leafy vegetables at least once a day,</i>

218
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,708
legumes a few times a week,

219
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:20,750
and stay away from tobacco
and any and all forms of alcohol.

220
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:25,333
I also like to inspect my stool
at least, uh, three times a week.

221
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:29,541
It should appear firm but not hard,
a clear sign of dehydration.

222
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:33,666
Now, which is why we should be drinking
several glasses of water a day,

223
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,583
nature's wonderful lubricant.

224
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:05,166
You're gloating.

225
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,083
I'm not.

226
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:14,833
- It was close.
- I still beat you.

227
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:16,375
Could have beat me sooner.

228
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:25,125
- You should learn the Sicilian Defense.
- What's that?

229
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:29,083
When White moves to king four,
Black does this.

230
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:32,375
- Then what?
- Knight to KB3.

231
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,250
What's KB3?

232
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,791
King's bishop three,
where I just put the knight.

233
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:41,250
The squares have names?

234
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,375
If you play well, they have names.

235
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,916
- Show me.
- Not now. Let's play again.

236
00:30:53,666 --> 00:30:54,500
You're mad.

237
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,416
I am not mad.

238
00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:58,708
Just play.

239
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:13,541
<i>There are other strategies</i>
<i>you'll need to learn, down the road.</i>

240
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:22,708
<i>The Levenfish Variation.</i>

241
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:38,416
<i>The Najdorf Variation.</i>

242
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:53,958
<i>Show me.</i>

243
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,125
<i>Levenfish.</i>

244
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,208
<i>Najdorf.</i>

245
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:15,625
Let's play again.

246
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:21,958
Elizabeth!

247
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:23,541
I'm sorry, Mrs. Deardorff.

248
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:27,125
- <i>Mom, guess what?</i>
<i>- I don't know. What?</i>

249
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:30,583
<i>- Mom, I've started my first period.
- Well, what do you know?</i>

250
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:40,375
- That isn't one you taught me.
- So?

251
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,125
But is that one of those things,

252
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:44,166
like the Sicilian Defense?

253
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:46,583
Stop!

254
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,833
Those things are called openings.

255
00:32:56,916 --> 00:32:58,375
Is that one of them?

256
00:32:58,458 --> 00:32:59,333
Yes.

257
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:02,250
The Queen's Gambit.

258
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:19,541
I'm playing White?

259
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:24,166
From now on, we take turns.
It's the way the game should be played.

260
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:27,708
Then, how come I couldn't go first before?

261
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,875
Play.

262
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:37,208
Check.

263
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,583
Mate.

264
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:00,125
Is that whiskey?

265
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:01,458
Mm-hmm.

266
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,541
Yes.

267
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:07,166
And don't tell.

268
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,833
I won't.

269
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,250
<i>Modern Chess Openings.</i>

270
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:23,041
It's the best book for you.

271
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,916
It will tell you all you wanna know.

272
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:29,458
You'll need to learn chess notation
before you can read it.

273
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:32,083
The names of the squares.

274
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:34,333
I'll teach you now.

275
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,625
Am I good enough now?

276
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:38,416
How old are you?

277
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,583
Nine.

278
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:42,541
Nine years old.

279
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:45,916
I'll be ten in November.

280
00:34:48,541 --> 00:34:50,291
To tell you the truth of it, child…

281
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:53,291
You're astounding.

282
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,291
<i>"Nobody heard him,</i>

283
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:58,541
the dead man,

284
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,250
but still he lay moaning."

285
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:04,625
"I was much further out than you thought,

286
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:07,916
and not waving but drowning."

287
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:09,916
"Poor chap,

288
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:13,208
he always loved larking, and now…

289
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,458
He's dead."

290
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:21,833
"It must have been too cold for him.
His heart gave way, they said."

291
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:24,250
"Oh, no, no, no,

292
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:27,250
it was too cold always."

293
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:30,541
"Still, the dead one lay moaning."

294
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:34,166
"I was much too far out all my life,

295
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,958
and not waving, but drowning."

296
00:35:48,791 --> 00:35:51,000
This is Mr. Ganz from the chess club.

297
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:53,666
- Chess club?
- We play at a club.

298
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,208
I'm also coach of the high school team.

299
00:35:57,291 --> 00:35:58,166
Duncan High?

300
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:07,583
Would you like to play me a game?

301
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,166
You play the color you choose.

302
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:22,708
This one.

303
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:30,541
Ah, the Réti Opening.

304
00:36:57,666 --> 00:36:58,833
That's mate in three.

305
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:22,500
Well, you certainly
know the game, young lady.

306
00:37:23,416 --> 00:37:24,625
Do you have a team here?

307
00:37:25,958 --> 00:37:28,333
The other girls,
do they have a chess club?

308
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:31,208
So, where do you play?

309
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,666
Down here.

310
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:38,708
Mr. Shaibel said
you play a few games every Sunday.

311
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:39,916
What do you do in between?

312
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:41,958
I play in my head.

313
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:44,708
In your head?

314
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:46,625
On the ceiling.

315
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:51,000
Oh…

316
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:53,000
Before I forget…

317
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:55,125
I brought you…

318
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:57,625
A present.

319
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:01,958
Go ahead, open it.

320
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,041
Well?

321
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:20,166
Thank you very much.

322
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:23,916
Do you want another game?

323
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:28,041
Check.

324
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:01,458
Beth…

325
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:04,416
I've moved my queen to rook four.

326
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:07,125
Check.

327
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,666
The bishop blocks.

328
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:15,333
Queen takes king's pawn.

329
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:17,708
Castles.

330
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:24,416
Knight takes knight.

331
00:39:27,541 --> 00:39:28,458
Mate in three.

332
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:31,166
First check is with the queen.

333
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:32,916
The king must take.

334
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:36,500
Then, the bishop checks on knight five…

335
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:38,875
And it's mate next.

336
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,666
Sweet Jesus.

337
00:39:50,458 --> 00:39:51,458
I have to go now.

338
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:54,500
Would you mind, Beth…

339
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:57,000
If I took your picture?

340
00:39:57,708 --> 00:40:00,166
I'd love to tell
the kids in chess club about you.

341
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:03,416
How about you stand next to Mr. Shaibel?

342
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,708
Closer.

343
00:40:20,791 --> 00:40:21,875
That's it.

344
00:40:22,708 --> 00:40:23,750
Say queen!

345
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,833
Queen.

346
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:34,208
Nine times four is?

347
00:40:41,916 --> 00:40:42,916
<i>Hiya, Marge.</i>

348
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,375
<i>Hi, I'm sorry I'm late,</i>
<i>but I ran into Jean, here.</i>

349
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:48,750
<i>Oh, Jean, this is Ed Reardon.
The Ed I was telling you about.</i>

350
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:49,875
<i>- Hello.
- How do you do?</i>

351
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:51,750
<i>And this is Jack Connors.</i>

352
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:54,625
<i>- Jean Bassett, from over at Morrisville.
- How do you do, Jean?</i>

353
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:56,666
- <i>Hello.</i>
<i>- Here, you can sit here.</i>

354
00:40:58,166 --> 00:40:59,833
- <i>Thank you.</i>
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

355
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:04,750
<i>- Would you like something? Malt or soda?</i>
- Hey, Mrs. Deardorff wants to see you.

356
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,291
<i>A well-mannered group, I think.</i>

357
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:09,583
<i>You notice their good manners right away.</i>

358
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:12,833
Mr. Ganz tells me
that you are a gifted child.

359
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:16,250
He has an unusual request to make.

360
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:20,458
He would like you
to be taken to the high school on…

361
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:22,000
- On Thursday.
- On Thursday.

362
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:23,083
In the afternoon.

363
00:41:23,708 --> 00:41:27,041
He maintains
that you are a phenomenal chess player.

364
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:30,666
He would like you
to perform for the chess club.

365
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:35,875
We have a dozen members,
and I was suggesting to Mrs. Deardorff

366
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:40,208
that you come along
and play all of them in a simultaneous.

367
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:41,916
In a what?

368
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,291
At the same time.

369
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:47,291
We like to give our girls a chance

370
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:50,458
for experience outside
whenever we can, but…

371
00:41:51,666 --> 00:41:55,333
I'm a bit wary of letting Elizabeth
go off to the local high school.

372
00:41:55,416 --> 00:41:57,083
Oh, well, I would chaperone.

373
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:59,625
I'd pick her up, take her to the school,
then bring her back.

374
00:41:59,708 --> 00:42:02,666
I was thinking a young lady
might also accompany her.

375
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,541
Well, I assumed that you would come,

376
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:07,458
as my guest.

377
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:09,083
Oh.

378
00:42:09,666 --> 00:42:10,875
No, I…

379
00:42:10,958 --> 00:42:13,958
I couldn't possibly
abandon my duties here.

380
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:16,958
Well, what if Shirley Munson,

381
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:19,416
club treasurer
and one of my best students,

382
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,583
she comes along?

383
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:24,208
What do you say, Elizabeth?

384
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,083
Do you want to play chess
at the high school?

385
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,416
Yes, I'd like to.

386
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,083
Okay.

387
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,958
It's settled, then.

388
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:37,750
Mr. Ganz and, uh…

389
00:42:38,583 --> 00:42:39,708
- Charlotte?
- Shirley.

390
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:40,666
Shirley, yes.

391
00:42:41,666 --> 00:42:44,916
They will pick you up,
let's say after lunch on Thursday?

392
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,833
Perfect.

393
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,166
I'll see you then.

394
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:00,833
Elizabeth.

395
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:05,541
I'm told that you've been playing chess
with our custodian.

396
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:07,625
With Mr. Shaibel.

397
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:09,916
Yes, ma'am.

398
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:13,625
This is very irregular, Elizabeth.

399
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:16,041
Have you gone to the basement?

400
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,125
Yes, ma'am.

401
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:20,458
Well, we can't have that.

402
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:23,750
As much as Methuen believes in excellence,

403
00:43:23,833 --> 00:43:26,208
we can't have you
playing chess in the basement.

404
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:33,125
I believe that we have chess sets
in the game closet.

405
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:36,041
I'll have Fergussen look into that.

406
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:38,708
That'll be all, Elizabeth.

407
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:41,083
Mind your manners at the high school.

408
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:42,750
Helen Deardorff.

409
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:48,500
- There's one missing.
- That's it.

410
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,833
Next.

411
00:43:50,916 --> 00:43:52,125
It's my turn, Harmon.

412
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Where are the green ones?

413
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:55,541
You don't get them anymore.

414
00:43:56,875 --> 00:43:58,416
There they are, right behind you.

415
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,791
I know where they are, Harmon,
but I'm not gonna give you any.

416
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:04,541
New state law.
No more tranquilizers for kids.

417
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,375
- Go figure.
- Harmon.

418
00:44:07,458 --> 00:44:08,666
"Go thou further off."

419
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,416
"Bid me farewell,
and let me hear thee going."

420
00:44:12,791 --> 00:44:14,250
- What?
- Beat it.

421
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,958
<i>Did Fergussen give you any green pills?</i>

422
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:09,875
Extra ones?

423
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:11,791
No, honey, I wish he would.

424
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,416
But they got the state after them

425
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,583
for what they've been doing
with those pills.

426
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:18,333
They're still there.

427
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:20,541
In the big jar.

428
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:21,458
That a fact?

429
00:45:23,375 --> 00:45:24,375
I ain't noticed.

430
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:30,583
You're having withdrawal symptoms?

431
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:32,375
I don't know.

432
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,416
What are those?

433
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:36,416
Withdrawal, like…

434
00:45:37,666 --> 00:45:39,500
I don't know, you getting edgy?

435
00:45:42,625 --> 00:45:43,708
Yeah, you are.

436
00:45:45,625 --> 00:45:46,541
You look around,

437
00:45:47,708 --> 00:45:50,875
there's gonna be some jumpy orphans
around here the next few days.

438
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:20,166
Harmon.

439
00:46:21,708 --> 00:46:22,541
You all right?

440
00:46:25,208 --> 00:46:27,583
- Do you play the King's Gambit?
- No.

441
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:28,958
It's my favorite.

442
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:31,125
Did you know chess is older than checkers?

443
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:33,541
- No.
- By, like, 400 years.

444
00:46:33,625 --> 00:46:34,458
Wait!

445
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:36,958
Can I talk to Beth?

446
00:46:37,625 --> 00:46:40,416
- Just for a second, wish her luck.
- Sure, go ahead.

447
00:46:46,791 --> 00:46:48,541
Good luck.

448
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,333
Take your seats and be quiet, please.

449
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:11,500
Charles Levy will take board number one
since he's our top player.

450
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:16,041
The rest of you can sit where you want to.
There will be no talking during play.

451
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:32,375
Do I start now?

452
00:48:32,458 --> 00:48:34,041
With board number one.

453
00:48:34,833 --> 00:48:36,500
And then I go on to the next one?

454
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:37,541
That's right.

455
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:07,541
They can't respond
until you've opened at every board.

456
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:22,541
<i>What surprised me was how bad they played.</i>

457
00:49:23,208 --> 00:49:25,500
They left backward pawns
all over the place,

458
00:49:26,041 --> 00:49:28,291
and their pieces were wide open for forks.

459
00:50:05,166 --> 00:50:07,750
<i>A few of them tried stupid mating attacks.</i>

460
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:12,166
But I took care of them.

461
00:50:17,291 --> 00:50:19,000
This boy, Charles Levy,

462
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:21,291
he was supposed to be the best.

463
00:50:22,041 --> 00:50:24,541
I had his pieces tied up in 15 moves.

464
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,416
<i>I mated him in six more,
with a knight-rook combination.</i>

465
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:43,041
Mr. Ganz told me I beat them all
in an hour and 20 minutes.

466
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:46,166
It felt good.

467
00:50:47,708 --> 00:50:49,291
I've never won anything before.

468
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,083
You should get back.

469
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,166
You can have the rest.

470
00:51:08,375 --> 00:51:09,541
- Jolene.
- Hey.

471
00:51:09,625 --> 00:51:11,083
Do you have any more vitamins?

472
00:51:12,125 --> 00:51:13,375
Don't be rude.

473
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,541
This is Samantha. She just got here.

474
00:51:17,333 --> 00:51:18,875
Haven't you got even just one?

475
00:51:20,666 --> 00:51:23,375
How'd the exhibit go?
You do okay?

476
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:26,083
- Fine, but I need...
- I don't want to hear about it.

477
00:51:28,875 --> 00:51:30,041
Hello, Samantha.

478
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:11,125
<i>Jesus. Renounce him, so all can hear.</i>

479
00:52:17,916 --> 00:52:20,666
<i>I cannot renounce him, sire. Nor can you.</i>

480
00:52:21,666 --> 00:52:23,416
<i>He is my king and yours as well.</i>

481
00:52:24,791 --> 00:52:26,083
<i>He is the son of God.</i>

482
00:52:28,458 --> 00:52:30,250
<i>And that is your answer?</i>

483
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:31,291
<i>Yes, sire.</i>

484
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:36,583
<i>Tribune Gallio,</i>

485
00:52:36,666 --> 00:52:39,916
<i>we decree that you be taken immediately
to the palace archery field</i>

486
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,625
<i>and put to death for high treason.</i>

487
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:52,833
<i>No, Diana.</i>
<i>No, there's no reason for it.</i>

488
00:52:52,916 --> 00:52:55,750
<i>Sire, Marcellus is my chosen husband.</i>

489
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:57,291
<i>I ask to go with him.</i>

490
00:52:57,375 --> 00:52:58,375
Bathroom.

491
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:00,041
Hurry up.

492
00:53:00,125 --> 00:53:02,083
<i>Stand back! You're not on trial!</i>

493
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,791
<i>There's no evidence against you!</i>

494
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:08,000
<i>Then if it please you, sire,</i>
<i>I'll provide evidence.</i>

495
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:17,333
<i>A traitor!</i>
<i>And a conspirator against the state!</i>

496
00:53:17,416 --> 00:53:18,750
<i>No, not Marcellus!</i>

497
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:20,833
<i>That's why he hasn't come to you.</i>

498
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,166
<i> Stop it!</i>

499
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,125
<i>But in you,</i>
<i>noble blood has turned to poison.</i>

500
00:53:35,208 --> 00:53:37,375
<i>You corrupt Rome
with your spite and malice.</i>

501
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:39,958
- <i>Stop! Stop it!</i>
<i>- You should be Caesar!</i>

502
00:53:55,041 --> 00:53:55,958
<i>Stop it!</i>

503
00:53:56,458 --> 00:53:58,625
<i>As for me, I have found another king.</i>

504
00:54:00,333 --> 00:54:02,208
<i>I want to go with my husband…</i>

505
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:04,333
<i>Into his kingdom.</i>

506
00:54:05,083 --> 00:54:07,583
<i>Then by the gods you shall!</i>

507
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,500
<i>Go, both of you!</i>

508
00:54:10,583 --> 00:54:12,291
<i>Into your kingdom!</i>

509
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:55,916
<i>They're going into a better kingdom.</i>

510
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,375
<i>They're going into a better kingdom!</i>

511
00:54:59,125 --> 00:55:00,875
<i>They're gonna meet their king!</i>

512
00:55:01,708 --> 00:55:03,541
<i>They're going to meet their king!</i>

513
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,958
All right, girls.

514
00:55:48,041 --> 00:55:50,875
Let's all have some cocoa
and discuss what we've learned.

515
00:56:07,041 --> 00:56:08,583
- Elizabeth!
- Mama?

516
00:56:09,791 --> 00:56:10,625
Elizabeth.
