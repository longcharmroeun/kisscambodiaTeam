1
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:10,041
<i>Men are gonna come along</i>
<i>and wanna teach you things.</i>

2
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:12,208
Doesn't make them any smarter.

3
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:16,083
In most ways, they're not,
but it makes them feel bigger.

4
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:19,250
They can show you how things are done.

5
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:21,291
You just let them blow by,

6
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:24,625
and you go on ahead,
and do just what the hell you feel like.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,666
<i>It takes a strong woman
to stay by herself,</i>

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,000
in a world where people
will settle for anything,

9
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,833
just to say they have something.

10
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:36,375
There we are.

11
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,708
So you never forget who you are.

12
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,833
- Pawn to king four.
- Pawn to queen bishop four.

13
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:09,875
- N to KB-3.
- Pawn to queen three.

14
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:10,791
P to Q4.

15
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,291
Pawn takes pawn.

16
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:15,458
- Knight takes.
- Knight… king bishop three.

17
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:18,000
- <i> N to QB-3.</i>
<i>- Pawn to king's knight three.</i>

18
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,000
P to B4.

19
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:20,166
P to B4.

20
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,833
The Levenfish. Never liked it.

21
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,833
- King to B3.
- I'll take the knight.

22
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,708
- Pawn takes.
- Pawn to king five.

23
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:27,916
Pawn takes again.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,458
Hey, you know what Scharz
says about that in the footnote?

25
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,041
I don't read the footnotes.

26
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:36,291
- Okay, well, it's time you started.
- I don't like Scharz.

27
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,750
Oh, I don't like Scharz either,
but I read him.

28
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:41,666
What's your move?

29
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:45,708
Queen takes queen. Check.

30
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:47,833
<i>The weather is hot today.</i>

31
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:50,708
I feel sick.

32
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,791
Mm.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Here you go.

34
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:45,750
Not that one.

35
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,458
This one.

36
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,041
Benny?

37
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,041
Come on.

38
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:55,125
- Is there a bathroom?
- Oh, yeah, it's just through there.

39
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,208
There's space in the closet.

40
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,500
You can hang your clothes up
in there if you want.

41
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,083
Okay.

42
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,958
- I thought I was gonna get a couch.
- No, I said living room.

43
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,833
Just gotta…

44
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:54,750
Pump it up.

45
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,875
- I got it.
- Really?

46
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,083
- You sure? Gonna be all right?
- Sure.

47
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,833
Oh, there's no booze in the apartment.

48
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,875
Didn't think there would be.

49
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,125
You can get changed in my bedroom.

50
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,166
I need a shower.

51
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,500
She's all yours.

52
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,875
Here, we'll start with these.

53
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,875
"The Hastings Christmas Chess Congress."

54
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,333
"Falaise Hall, White Rock Gardens."

55
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,916
"Record of games."

56
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:41,083
"Luchenko-Uhlmann. Borgov-Penrose."

57
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,625
<i>"Grandmaster Chess."</i> Whoo!

58
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,125
Play the Hastings games first.

59
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,291
I'll play black.

60
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,791
I haven't had any breakfast.

61
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,041
Eggs are in the fridge.

62
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,000
Thank you.

63
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,083
Then, we'll play the Borgov games first.

64
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,708
- All of them?
- He will be in Paris.

65
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:01,625
Fine.

66
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:03,750
I will eat first.

67
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:11,958
<i>Why not advance the knight?</i>
<i>Why isn't he defending against the rook?</i>

68
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,333
<i>What's gonna become of the backward pawn?</i>

69
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,333
<i>You replay the game
so you can feel the wins for yourself.</i>

70
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,166
<i>You read game books like Reinfeld</i>

71
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,250
<i>that are full of queen sacrifices
and melodrama.</i>

72
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,791
<i>You know from your tournament experience</i>

73
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:39,041
<i>you can't rely on your opponent
setting himself up for a queen sacrifice,</i>

74
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,625
<i>or a surprise mate
with a knight and a rook.</i>

75
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,083
<i>But that's who you are.</i>

76
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,958
<i>You're bored with ordinary chess,</i>

77
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,333
<i>even when it's played by Grandmasters.</i>

78
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,458
<i>You're bored in the way you probably were</i>

79
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,083
<i>when you read
Reuben Fine's endgame analysis.</i>

80
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,291
<i>And then the counter analysis</i>
<i>in </i>Chess Review

81
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,208
<i>that pointed out the errors
in Reuben Fine.</i>

82
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,416
Benny…

83
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,125
…look at this.

84
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,083
Fine missed one.

85
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,125
Look. Ready?

86
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,375
Black…

87
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:19,666
Has this…

88
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:21,750
With the knight.

89
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,041
- Yeah.
- It's good, it's good!

90
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,875
Yeah. Yeah.

91
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:31,666
Huh.

92
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:40,125
<i>And you haven't done anything</i>
<i>like what I'm making you do now.</i>

93
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,500
<i>We're playing serious chess.</i>

94
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,833
<i>Workmanlike chess.</i>

95
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,833
The kind of chess played
by the best players in the world,

96
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:50,833
the Soviets.

97
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:56,083
And you know why
they're the best players in the world?

98
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,000
They have the best suits?

99
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,375
It's because they play together as a team,

100
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,708
especially during adjournments.

101
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,541
They help each other out.

102
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:10,208
Us Americans, we work alone
because we're all such individualists.

103
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,708
We don't like to let anyone help us.

104
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,041
You're helping me now.

105
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,166
Am I?

106
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,541
'Cause it looks more
like I'm putting you to sleep.

107
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,333
I'm sorry.

108
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:22,875
I'm tired.

109
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,250
I should probably go to bed.

110
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,083
What, and miss out on all the fun?

111
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,791
Mm. I'll survive.

112
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,458
What fun?

113
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,916
I wonder who that could be.

114
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,791
Hey!

115
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,416
Right on time.

116
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,916
- Come on in, come on in.
- Good to see you.

117
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,416
Beth Harmon, this is Hilton Wexler
and Grandmaster Arthur Levertov.

118
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:57,500
The new champ.

119
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,708
Hi.

120
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,166
Congratulations.
Benny needed a lesson in humility.

121
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,791
I'm already tops in humility.

122
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:04,875
Hello, Beth.

123
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,250
Uh… oh…

124
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,166
I'm Cleo.

125
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,083
Hi.

126
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,375
Do you do problems?

127
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,958
- No.
- Never?

128
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,708
I always found them irrelevant.

129
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:18,541
Positions that never come up
in actual games.

130
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,708
Let me show you one you might like.

131
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:23,375
Okay.

132
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,125
- Can I mess this up?
- Go ahead.

133
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,458
Hilton, she is not
one of your problem freaks.

134
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,041
- She's the US Champion, for Christ's sake.
- It's okay.

135
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,750
This one is…

136
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,375
…my favorite.

137
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,875
How does White win in three?

138
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,416
Benny, under what mound
do you hide your drinking glasses?

139
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,000
Hey, quit distracting her.

140
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:48,500
She's not.

141
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,291
King to queen seven.

142
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,125
Jesus! That's fast.

143
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,958
Drink?

144
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,916
No, thank you.

145
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,166
I should fix the food.

146
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,083
Come on, that's enough of that.

147
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:14,500
- Come on.
- Do you ever clean?

148
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,750
Are you here with Arthur or Hilton?

149
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,333
Both of them.

150
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,125
Neither of them.

151
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,458
Two of them are better than one,
if you know what I mean.

152
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,125
How do you all know each other?

153
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,166
A sad story,

154
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,208
involving me, a bad breakup,

155
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,458
and a walk through
<i>le</i> Jardin du Luxembourg,

156
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,375
where those two stopped me
from killing myself.

157
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,791
Like I say, a sad story.

158
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,458
But as I walked past,

159
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:47,958
Arthur and Hilton were having
a violent argument over a chessboard,

160
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,166
and I became mesmerized by their passion.

161
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,166
Well, that's how they tell it, anyway.

162
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,291
No, the truth is, um…

163
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,291
Benny was there,
and I became mesmerized by Benny.

164
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,958
Over and done.

165
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,166
What do you do?

166
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:06,541
Guess.

167
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,458
Something in fashion?

168
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,291
That's a nice way to put it.

169
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,416
I'm a model.

170
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,125
Wow.

171
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,166
That must be exciting.

172
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,291
Fashion is exciting.
Modeling and models are insipid.

173
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,375
But it pays for my studio in the Marais.

174
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,208
Oh, you have not been to Paris?

175
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,583
Not yet.

176
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,416
- Do you live there?
- Sometimes.

177
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,750
Sometimes Berlin, sometimes here.

178
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,125
I'm a, uh…

179
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:41,125
- How do you say? A vagabond?
- I don't know.

180
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,000
Modeling sounds pretty exciting to me.

181
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,416
Plus, I imagine
they give you a lot of free clothes.

182
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,333
Ah, you like nice clothes, huh?

183
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,083
I do.

184
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,208
You could never be a model.

185
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,208
You are pretty enough,
but you are much too smart.

186
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,875
Models are empty creatures.

187
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:03,291
The camera lens fills them
with color and texture,

188
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,333
and, once in a while, even mystery.

189
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,416
But just like there is no mystery
to a vacant lot,

190
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,708
it's just there until you put
something interesting on top of it…

191
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,875
Models are the same.

192
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,750
They are just what you put on them.

193
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,250
You know, most are terrible in bed.

194
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:25,125
But then, anyone who doesn't eat
is terrible in bed, don't you think?

195
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,458
Here we go.

196
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:43,416
What?

197
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,625
Let's do a simultaneous.

198
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,166
You…

199
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:49,666
Play all of us.

200
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,083
Uh, not me.
I don't even know the rules.

201
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,500
I'll spectate.

202
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,500
- Do we have enough boards, enough pieces?
- Yeah, in the closet.

203
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,416
We can set them up
right here on the floor.

204
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,250
Okay.

205
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,416
- Time control?
- Let's play speed chess.

206
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,875
Well, that'll give us an edge.
We can think on your time.

207
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,583
Mm. I wanna try it.

208
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,166
You're not so good at that, remember?

209
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,750
I'll bet you ten I can beat you.

210
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,041
What if you throw the other games,
spend all your time against me?

211
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,208
What if I kick you in the crotch?

212
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:27,250
- I'll bet you ten on them, too.
- Okay. It's your money.

213
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:28,666
It will be.

214
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:34,875
Let's do it again.

215
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:13,833
Again.

216
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,625
Again.

217
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,166
Well, kid…

218
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,250
I think you've got it.

219
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,750
It was such a pleasure.
Do look me up if you come to Paris.

220
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,208
- Will you be there in two weeks?
- Oh, who knows?

221
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,583
- Ah, bye.
- Bye-bye.

222
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,083
What?

223
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:35,583
Nobody has done that to me in 15 years.

224
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,875
- Not even Borgov?
- Not even Borgov.

225
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,541
And I'm sober as a judge,

226
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,083
as Alma would say.

227
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,416
I, myself, am not.

228
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,166
Good night.

229
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,041
Night.

230
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:01,750
Wait. Hey.

231
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:08,250
Yes?

232
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,166
Do you still like my hair?

233
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,625
<i>That's</i> what it's supposed to feel like.

234
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:31,958
Hello?

235
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,291
You should play the Sicilian.

236
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:38,291
What?

237
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:42,125
In your game with Borgov,
you should play the Sicilian.

238
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,000
Why?

239
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,916
It's what he's so good at.

240
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,958
It's also
what you're most comfortable with.

241
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,791
You should always
play your line, never his.

242
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,416
You play what's best for you.

243
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:57,958
Thank you.

244
00:18:59,041 --> 00:18:59,875
Anything else?

245
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:02,875
One more thing.

246
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,208
They never say "check"
at the big tournaments.

247
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,250
Are you serious?

248
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,208
Yeah, very.
They never lay their kings down, either.

249
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,875
I meant, "Are you serious?"

250
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,291
"This is what you're thinking about
right now?"

251
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,416
Good night, Benny.

252
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,166
Good night.

253
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,500
<i>Welcome to our international tournament.</i>

254
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:40,750
<i>This is a single round-robin event.</i>

255
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,250
<i>Everyone plays everyone.</i>

256
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,791
<i>There are six players and five rounds.</i>

257
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,416
One round a day for five days

258
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,500
with one day off for adjournments.

259
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,833
<i>Places in our cross table
have been chosen by lot.</i>

260
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,625
<i>Colors have been chosen accordingly.</i>

261
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:02,583
Mr. Borgov, what's
it like to compete with younger players,

262
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,875
and how much longer
do you think you'll play?

263
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:27,250
"I feel good,
as good as I felt when I was 4 years old,

264
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,791
and played my first game."

265
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:30,791
<i>"Chess still…</i>

266
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,208
<i>Excites me in the same way."</i>

267
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,000
<i>"I have no plans to stop playing,</i>

268
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,791
<i>and I'll…</i>

269
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:40,125
likely die with my head on a chessboard."

270
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:45,083
Miss Harmon, what do you say
to those in the Chess Federation

271
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,500
<i>who accuse you of being too glamorous</i>

272
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,166
to be a serious chess player?

273
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,708
I would say
that it's much easier to play chess

274
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,708
without the burden of an Adam's apple.

275
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,875
So, how are you feeling
about your match with Alec Bergland?

276
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,333
I'm looking forward to it.

277
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,583
Does that mean you think you can beat him?

278
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,416
It means that I have to beat him.

279
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:13,166
Miss Harmon, do you feel good
about rematch with Grandmaster Borgov?

280
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,666
Very good.

281
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,500
I slept on the plane,
so I arrived in Paris with no jet lag.

282
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,250
I'm very well rested.

283
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:23,541
At night, I stay in my room,
and study Mr. Borgov's old games.

284
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,916
Including the one against you
in Mexico City?

285
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,208
Especially that one.

286
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:36,000
<i>The time control</i>
<i>is 40 moves in two and half hours.</i>

287
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:37,416
Any questions?

288
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,000
Very well.

289
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,416
Good luck to each of you.

290
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,333
May the best man,

291
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:42,333
or woman,

292
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:43,583
win.

293
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:44,166
I'm sorry, Mademoiselle?

294
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,958
Excuse me. Would it be possible
to have an autograph?

295
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:54,375
Mademoiselle.

296
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,875
Tomorrow, it's you…

297
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:59,375
…against Grandmaster Borgov.

298
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:47,708
Hello?

299
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:51,208
<i>What, you thought you could sneak</i>
<i>into town without me knowing?</i>

300
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:53,000
Who is this?

301
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:54,583
<i>And now you insult me.</i>

302
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:59,291
- Cleo?
- A very sad Cleo.

303
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:02,666
<i> I'm sorry. I was just…</i>

304
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:05,916
- Where are you?
<i>- Downstairs.</i>

305
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,791
- Here?
- I thought you might come down

306
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:10,000
and join me for a drink.

307
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:14,125
I have a match tomorrow.

308
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:17,000
One drink<i>,</i> and then you go back up
and resume your rigors.

309
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:19,875
It's the final.

310
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:22,041
I should probably sleep.

311
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:23,250
<i>Of course you should.</i>

312
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:24,708
<i>I understand.</i>

313
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:27,750
But maybe tomorrow night?

314
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:30,083
Well, who knows
where I'll be so far in the future?

315
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:32,833
But, um, I wish you luck in your match.

316
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:35,125
Thank you.

317
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:37,500
<i>You know, it's a lovely bar.</i>

318
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:41,000
I think I'll go toast
your success on my own.

319
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,833
Sweet dreams.

320
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:08,416
Hi.

321
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:13,000
So, the pretty girl has taste
to go with her other gifts, huh?

322
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:16,000
You make me sick, you know.

323
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,875
Thank you, so do you.

324
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,333
Now, just one drink.

325
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,416
I wanna get to bed early.

326
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,041
Okay.

327
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:29,208
So, what will you have then,
for your one drink?

328
00:26:29,791 --> 00:26:31,750
Must be special if it is your only one.

329
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,291
What are you having?

330
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,833
It's called <i>pastis.</i>

331
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:39,916
Very Parisian, very ordinary.

332
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,041
Here, try it.

333
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,583
Tastes like licorice.

334
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:52,500
Mmm.

335
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,833
The anise.

336
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,833
I like it.

337
00:26:56,958 --> 00:27:00,208
- I could see myself living here.
- I could see it, too.

338
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:03,041
A little <i>pied-à-terre</i>
on the Rue des Capucines,

339
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:04,583
or the Boulevard Raspail.

340
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,625
In a few years, I'll be world champion.

341
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:09,541
I can live wherever I want.

342
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,000
It will be much sooner than that.

343
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:14,125
If I lived here…

344
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:19,666
I would go to plays, and concerts, and…

345
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,250
I would eat lunch
in a different cafe every day.

346
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:25,666
And I would dress the way
that women do here, you know?

347
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:29,291
So smart with their nice dresses,
and their perfect haircuts.

348
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:31,666
You already have
so much more than they do.

349
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:35,000
And something that none of them have.

350
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:36,958
Talent.

351
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,666
And that can give you a life
that anyone would envy.

352
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:45,000
There's nothing keeping me in Kentucky.

353
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:47,875
The possibilities are endless.

354
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,291
And one of those possibilities
is staring at you.

355
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,000
No, they're looking at you.

356
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,750
I think not.

357
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,000
You are very beautiful.

358
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:08,250
- I don't see myself that way.
- Then you are blind.

359
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:09,291
Do you like to fuck?

360
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:11,833
- Cleo!
- What?

361
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:14,291
I make it easier for you.
Did you like to fuck Benny?

362
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:16,666
Sometimes.

363
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,208
How romantic.

364
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:20,875
And have you ever been in love?

365
00:28:22,791 --> 00:28:23,791
Not with Benny.

366
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:24,708
Of course not.

367
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:27,875
No woman can compete
with Benny's love for himself.

368
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:32,791
So, we are still in love?

369
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:36,250
What's his name?

370
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:39,333
Townes.

371
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:43,833
To unrequited love.

372
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:46,791
And to stupid men.

373
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:48,416
Exactly.

374
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:55,916
Let's see how many lies they tell.

375
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:57,458
Excuse me?

376
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,208
Mademoiselle?
Mademoiselle Harmon, <i>vous êtes là?</i>

377
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:18,500
Mademoiselle, <i>on vous attend.</i>

378
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:23,000
<i>Je descends tout de suite.</i>

379
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:23,916
Okay?

380
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,125
Thank you.

381
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:12,458
I'm sorry.

382
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:21,708
I resign.

383
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:33,291
<i>There's a rumor you were drunk.</i>

384
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:34,666
<i>I wasn't drunk.</i>

385
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,583
<i>Or hungover, then.</i>

386
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,375
<i> I could have been stone-cold sober.</i>

387
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:42,291
<i>It wouldn't have made
the slightest difference.</i>

388
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:43,708
<i>I don't believe that.</i>

389
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:46,583
<i>What time do you get in?
I can come pick you up.</i>

390
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:48,833
<i> I'm going back to Lexington.</i>

391
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:50,583
<i>I need to be alone.</i>

392
00:33:50,666 --> 00:33:53,291
<i>That is the opposite of what you need.</i>

393
00:33:53,375 --> 00:33:56,583
<i>Beth, please just come to New York.
We can talk it out.</i>

394
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:02,000
<i>- Beth?</i>
<i>- Thank you, Benny.</i>

395
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,583
<i>For everything.</i>

396
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:07,500
<i>You shouldn't be by yourself.</i>
<i>You know what happens.</i>

397
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:09,125
<i>Maybe that's what I want.</i>

398
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:13,125
- <i>What, to get drunk?</i>
<i>- Yeah, good and drunk.</i>

399
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:14,958
<i>Fucking bombed.</i>

400
00:34:15,708 --> 00:34:17,541
<i>And maybe high, too. Why not?</i>

401
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:20,875
- <i>You wouldn't if you were with me.</i>
<i>- I know.</i>

402
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:24,083
<i>What if I said,</i>
<i>"Go ahead, get drunk"?</i>

403
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:25,583
<i>Would you come then?</i>

404
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:28,750
<i>Benny, I don't know what I'm doing.</i>

405
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:32,708
<i>Or going to do.</i>

406
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,583
- Hello.
<i>- This is Dick Chennault.</i>

407
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,208
- Um…
<i>- Your lawyer.</i>

408
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:09,458
Oh.

409
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:13,875
<i>I tried to get you three times yesterday,
and the day before. Where you been?</i>

410
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,875
In Paris.

411
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:18,416
Playing chess.

412
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:20,166
<i>How sweet it must be.</i>

413
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:23,958
What is it I can do for you,
Mr. Chennault?

414
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:26,791
<i>Uh, it's, uh, it's Wheatley.
He doesn't wanna sign.</i>

415
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:29,333
Sign what?

416
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:31,000
<i>Title for the house.</i>

417
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:34,333
<i>Can you get over here
so we can work it out?</i>

418
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,958
I don't see why you would need me.
You're the lawyer.

419
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:41,958
And he said he would sign
whatever was necessary, so…

420
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:44,791
<i>Oh, well, apparently,
he's changed his mind.</i>

421
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,083
Come in.

422
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:06,166
Beth.

423
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,458
<i>Mr. Wheatley has a proposal.</i>

424
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:13,041
You can live here while you're looking
for something permanent.

425
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:16,458
I thought I could keep the house
if I made the payments.

426
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:17,583
Uh, Mr. Wheatley…

427
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:20,208
Says you misconstrued him.

428
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:24,541
He, uh, claims he was just permitting you
to stay in the house, uh…

429
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:26,250
Until you got settled.

430
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,916
That's not true.

431
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:30,666
He said I could have it.

432
00:36:32,416 --> 00:36:33,250
Remember?

433
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:38,875
Can't you even look at me?

434
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:43,500
- You adopted me. Can't you talk to me?
- Alma.

435
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:46,666
- Alma wanted a child.
- You signed the papers.

436
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:50,250
- You took on a responsibility.
- Alma wanted to adopt you, not me.

437
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,875
You're not entitled to everything I own,

438
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:54,041
just 'cause I signed
some papers to shut her up.

439
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:56,291
Not that it worked.

440
00:36:57,666 --> 00:36:59,458
You adopted me.

441
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:02,083
I didn't ask you to.

442
00:37:03,416 --> 00:37:06,166
- You're my legal father.
- The money in this house is mine!

443
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:08,875
No smart-assed orphan
is gonna take it away from me.

444
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:11,708
Oh, I'm not an orphan.
I'm your daughter.

445
00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:13,166
Not in my book, you aren't.

446
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:16,500
I don't give a shit
what your goddamn lawyer says.

447
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:20,000
Or what Alma said, either.
That woman could not keep her mouth shut.

448
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:22,375
I thought the piano would help, it didn't.

449
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:23,875
So, here you are.

450
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:26,000
It's all so pathetic.

451
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:30,916
Did you ever hear her play?

452
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,333
Of course.

453
00:37:33,416 --> 00:37:35,250
Yes, but did you ever really listen?

454
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:39,125
Alma was not pathetic,
she was stuck. There's a difference.

455
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,125
She didn't know how to get out of it.

456
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:42,750
Pathetic, well…

457
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,208
I'm looking at pathetic.

458
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,833
What do you want from Beth, Mr. Wheatley?

459
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:55,000
- I want her out. I'm selling the house.
- Sell it to me.

460
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:56,958
What are you talking about?

461
00:37:57,958 --> 00:37:58,791
I'll buy it.

462
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:01,166
I'll pay whatever your equity is.

463
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,583
- No, it's worth more than that now.
- How much more?

464
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:06,791
I'd need 7,000.

465
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:08,416
Your equity is less than five.

466
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,750
It's seven. I'll show you the receipts.

467
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,000
Fine.

468
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:17,291
Seven thousand.

469
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:21,750
- You have that much?
- Yes.

470
00:38:22,416 --> 00:38:25,500
But I will be subtracting
what I paid to bury Mother.

471
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:29,791
I'll show you the receipts.

472
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:33,458
It's too hot in here.

473
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:40,208
Well…

474
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:42,125
Good luck.

475
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,375
I'll, uh…
…send over the paperwork in a day or so.

476
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,750
Um…

477
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:26,875
Hi.

478
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:28,916
You want another job?

479

00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:08,916
<i>We would like to help you
in your forthcoming struggle,</i>

488
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,041
<i>since we share your Christian ideals
and aspirations.</i>

489
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:16,458
<i>If you are interested in our support,</i>

490
00:42:16,541 --> 00:42:18,875
<i>please contact our offices in Houston.</i>

491
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:23,458
<i>Yours in Christ, Crawford Walker.</i>

492
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,416
<i>Take the money. They're loaded.</i>

493
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,666
<i>They'd pay for my ticket to Russia?</i>

494
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:29,708
More than that.

495
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:34,000
If you need to play another match before,
they'll back you,

496
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:36,625
and if you ask them,
they'll fly me out there with you.

497
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:40,625
<i>Separate rooms, of course,
considering their views.</i>

498
00:42:40,708 --> 00:42:42,000
Why would they pay so much?

499
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:45,541
They want us to beat Communists for Jesus.

500
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:49,875
These are the same people that paid
for part of my way two years ago.

501
00:42:52,916 --> 00:42:54,041
Are you, uh…

502
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:56,166
Coming to New York?

503
00:42:58,458 --> 00:43:00,166
I have to stay in Kentucky a bit longer.

504
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:04,750
<i>I have a tournament in San Francisco,
and I need to take care of this place now.</i>

505
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,708
I'm fine, Benny, really.

506
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:11,291
<i>How are you?</i>

507
00:43:11,916 --> 00:43:12,750
I'm managing.

508
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,416
I miss you.

509
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:26,208
Study the game pamphlets
from the last Moscow Invitational.

510
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:29,708
- I'm not even sure I'm gonna go.
<i>- Just do it, Beth.</i>

511
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:31,666
Write the Jesus people back.

512
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:34,500
Tell them you will take all the help
that they can give you.

513
00:44:56,708 --> 00:45:00,083
I will have the asparagus vinaigrette
as an appetizer

514
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:01,958
while I think about my main course.

515
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:03,333
Very well, Miss Harmon.

516
00:45:03,416 --> 00:45:05,125
And would you care for a cocktail?

517
00:45:06,666 --> 00:45:08,375
No, uh, Coke is fine.

518
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:11,708
Actually…

519
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:14,333
I'll have a Gibson.

520
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:16,208
On the rocks.

521
00:45:17,458 --> 00:45:18,416
Of course.

522
00:47:03,458 --> 00:47:04,291
Hello.

523
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:05,916
<i>Beth?</i>

524
00:47:07,166 --> 00:47:08,000
<i>Hello?</i>

525
00:49:40,166 --> 00:49:41,291
That's my girl.

526
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:07,416
Beth?

527
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:11,583
Are you in there?

528
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:15,541
I've been calling.

529
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:17,875
Are you okay?

530
00:50:18,875 --> 00:50:20,000
I'm worried about you.

531
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,583
Beth, it's Harry.

532
00:50:28,833 --> 00:50:31,166
Beth, if you're in there,
please open the door.

533
00:51:03,041 --> 00:51:03,875
Hello.

534
00:51:04,416 --> 00:51:05,583
<i>Elizabeth Harmon?</i>

535
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,791
- Yeah.
<i>- This is Ed Spencer.</i>

536
00:51:12,041 --> 00:51:12,875
Okay.

537
00:51:13,458 --> 00:51:15,291
<i>I'm the local tournament director.</i>

538
00:51:15,375 --> 00:51:16,750
<i>I'm calling about tomorrow.</i>

539
00:51:18,291 --> 00:51:19,125
Tomorrow?

540
00:51:19,666 --> 00:51:20,500
<i>The tournament.</i>

541
00:51:21,208 --> 00:51:23,375
<i>We were wondering
if you could come an hour early.</i>

542
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:25,583
<i>The Louisville paper
is sending a photographer,</i>

543
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:27,791
<i>and we think WLEX will have somebody.</i>

544
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:29,958
<i>Could you come at nine?</i>

545
00:51:32,833 --> 00:51:33,916
<i>Miss Harmon?</i>

546
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,791
Uh, yeah, um…

547
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:38,333
I'll be there at 9:30.

548
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,666
Half an hour is more than enough time
to take the pictures.

549
00:51:44,958 --> 00:51:45,791
Shit.

550
00:51:47,791 --> 00:51:48,625
Fuck.

551
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:01,791
Oh, shit.

552
00:52:02,458 --> 00:52:03,375
Beth.

553
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:05,041
Ed Spencer.

554
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:08,291
- You made it.
- Yeah, hi. Um…

555
00:52:09,708 --> 00:52:12,125
You wouldn't happen to have any aspirin?

556
00:52:12,208 --> 00:52:14,500
- I'm sure I could find you some.
- Thank you.

557
00:52:16,083 --> 00:52:18,000
- N-no.
- Beth Harmon?

558
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,041
Annette Packer.

559
00:52:21,791 --> 00:52:24,500
I was your first official win.
You cleaned my clock.

560
00:52:24,583 --> 00:52:27,250
- The whole thing lasted about 15 minutes.
- Sorry.

561
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:28,875
Oh, don't be, it's an honor.

562
00:52:28,958 --> 00:52:30,250
I'm always telling people

563
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:33,541
that I was there for
two of your big firsts.

564
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:39,333
I… I knew you were going places,
and that meant something to me.

565
00:52:40,166 --> 00:52:41,000
You know?

566
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:42,916
That it was possible…

567
00:52:44,166 --> 00:52:45,000
For us.

568
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,458
So, are you playing here today?

569
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:52,000
Oh, God, no.

570
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:54,125
I haven't played in a few years now.

571
00:52:54,208 --> 00:52:56,625
I'm premed, so I have exactly zero time.

572
00:52:58,833 --> 00:53:00,833
I, um, I-I do miss it, though.

573
00:53:02,708 --> 00:53:03,541
Yeah.

574
00:53:04,458 --> 00:53:08,166
I, uh, I heard you were gonna be here,
so I came down for the weekend.

575
00:53:09,208 --> 00:53:10,708
To thank you in person.

576
00:53:16,333 --> 00:53:17,166
Anyway,

577
00:53:17,916 --> 00:53:18,916
I'll see you inside.

578
00:53:21,375 --> 00:53:22,208
Bye.

579
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:32,000
Shit.

580
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,333
Oh, thank you.

581
00:53:36,416 --> 00:53:38,166
There's no smoking in here.

582
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:41,041
Right, of course. Thanks.

583
00:53:43,541 --> 00:53:45,416
Play starts in a few minutes.

584
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,333
Right on!

585
00:53:51,833 --> 00:53:52,708
Goddamnit!

586
00:54:06,625 --> 00:54:07,875
You got a new car.

587
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,875
Yeah, I, uh, I wrecked the other one.

588
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:14,291
This one's more me.

589
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:16,875
Are you here to play or…

590
00:54:17,416 --> 00:54:19,875
- No.
- Well, what are you doing here?

591
00:54:22,291 --> 00:54:23,416
I've been calling.

592
00:54:24,916 --> 00:54:26,166
I even came by one time.

593
00:54:27,958 --> 00:54:29,083
Did you?

594
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:30,000
Yeah.

595
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,166
I'm worried about you.

596
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:36,625
What on earth for?

597
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:39,458
I've seen you once or twice
at the supermarket.

598
00:54:40,291 --> 00:54:41,208
You following me?

599
00:54:41,291 --> 00:54:42,250
I work there.

600
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:45,166
What?

601
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:48,416
I'm Assistant Manager,
so I'm usually in the office.

602
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:52,333
You've never said hello.

603
00:54:52,833 --> 00:54:54,041
Well, you didn't seem…

604
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,458
Approachable.

605
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:01,500
You need help.

606
00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:03,375
What kind of help would that be?

607
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:05,916
Help with my chess? We tried that...

608
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,125
- That's not what I'm talking about.
- What are we talking about?

609
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:12,458
My dad drank.

610
00:55:13,958 --> 00:55:15,750
He wasn't mean or anything.

611
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:18,250
He just got quiet
and fell asleep in his clothes.

612
00:55:21,083 --> 00:55:23,250
- Okay.
- You smell just like he did.

613
00:55:24,291 --> 00:55:25,958
Your eyes are just like his eyes,

614
00:55:26,875 --> 00:55:28,625
- and your skin is...
- My skin?

615
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:29,791
Like I said…

616
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:32,083
I'm worried about you.

617
00:55:32,166 --> 00:55:34,041
Sounds more like
you're feeling sorry for me.

618
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:35,333
I didn't say that.

619
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:38,166
I'm not the one supposed to be in college,
not working in a supermarket.

620
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:39,125
I'm doing both.

621
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:40,208
You know what?

622
00:55:41,458 --> 00:55:42,833
Yeah, I like working there.

623
00:55:43,833 --> 00:55:45,916
It's a good job, and the people are nice.

624
00:55:47,083 --> 00:55:48,000
Elizabeth!

625
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:54,333
Good luck, Beth.

626
00:56:49,291 --> 00:56:51,416
Ow! Damn it! Harry!

627
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:55,750
I told you to leave me alone!

628
00:56:58,625 --> 00:57:01,291
Jesus fucking Christ.

629
00:57:03,125 --> 00:57:05,833
Who the hell are you?

630
00:57:07,666 --> 00:57:08,500
Jolene?
