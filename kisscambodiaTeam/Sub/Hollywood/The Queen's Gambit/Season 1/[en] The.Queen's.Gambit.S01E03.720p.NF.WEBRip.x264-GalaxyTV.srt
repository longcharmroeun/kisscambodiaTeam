1
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:50,958
Mom!

2
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:43,166
Well, now.

3
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:46,541
Welcome.

4
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:14,666
- <i>Got a cigarette, doctor?</i>
<i>- Sorry, I…</i>

5
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,916
I asked for a pleasant room,

6
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,208
and I believe they gave me one.

7
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,500
- I'm Beth.
- Harmon. Kentucky State Champion.

8
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:08,625
Nice to meet you.

9
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:13,375
There are two games a day,
and the time control is 120/40.

10
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,500
You get two hours to make 40 moves.

11
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,541
Welcome to Cincinnati.

12
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,000
Thank you.

13
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:29,208
And the rook comes to the seventh rank.

14
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:30,958
That right there…

15
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,875
That is a bone in the throat.

16
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:38,125
Guy takes one look at this,
he pays up, 20 bucks.

17
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,458
The Caro-Kann Defense, genuine bummer.

18
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,541
What's wrong with Caro-Kann?

19
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,291
It's all pawns and no hope.

20
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:51,250
Here, look, I'll show you, all right?
This is Caro-Kann.

21
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,291
I'd take the knight.

22
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,208
You're, um…

23
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,041
Aren't you that kid from Kentucky
who wiped out Harry Beltik?

24
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,875
If you take his knight,
then you double his pawns.

25
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,708
Big deal. Like I said, it's all pawns…

26
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,666
And no hope.

27
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,125
Let me show you how you win with Black.

28
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,583
Watch this.

29
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:19,791
What does White do here?

30
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:23,291
- Queen takes pawn.
- Queen takes pawn.

31
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,458
Rook to king eight. Check.

32
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:28,500
Queen falls.

33
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,916
- That's Mieses-Reshevsky.
- Yeah.

34
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,583
- From the '30s.
- Very good. Margate, 1935.

35
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,958
- White played rook to queen one.
- What else has he got?

36
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,416
All right, I gotta go.

37
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,458
Hey, you know what?

38
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,708
Reshevsky, he was playing like that…

39
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,750
Back when he was your age, little girl.

40
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:50,833
Or even younger.

41
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:55,666
Are you playing?

42
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,333
Oh, what, here?

43
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,791
Nah, nah.

44
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,208
Just come through, see some old friends.

45
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,333
And plus, playing too many opens…

46
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,083
It can only hurt me, you know what I mean?

47
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,041
Good luck.

48
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,291
- Hello.
- Hello.

49
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,000
Beth Harmon. Where am I playing?

50
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,958
It's table 15, right over there.

51
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,166
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

52
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,250
- Beth Harmon.
- Shit.

53
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,375
- Hey!
- Stupid…

54
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,500
- Harmon?
- What are you two doing here?

55
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,500
Losing mostly.

56
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:54,000
We're on the university team now.
Second and third alternate.

57
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,791
Oh, I'm sorry we won't get to play.

58
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,833
We're not.
You destroy everyone you play, Harmon.

59
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:03,333
- I can only lose so much.
- That's the truth.

60
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,250
<i>I said slow down!</i>

61
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,041
<i>Isn't that skating rink</i>
<i>a little close to the bowling alley?</i>

62
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,625
Do you mind?

63
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,250
- Sorry.
<i>- It works out. You see, it…</i>

64
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:25,166
<i>It keeps the bowlers cool,
and you automatically…</i>

65
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,416
What are you doing?

66
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,541
Replaying my earlier games.

67
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,666
What on earth for?

68
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,708
Looking for weaknesses in my play.

69
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,083
I see.

70
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,166
And?

71
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,500
There aren't any.

72
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,250
Good girl.

73
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,291
It's so much more exciting
than I imagined.

74
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,833
Did you watch the whole game?

75
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,333
Of course.

76
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,250
Beth.

77
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,833
When he brought out his rook,
then took that pawn…

78
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,333
I thought you were done for.
I should have known better.

79
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,500
Yes, you should have.

80
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:53,416
Elizabeth,

81
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,375
aren't you going to introduce me
to your friends?

82
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,708
Sorry.

83
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,583
Matt, Mike, this is my mom.

84
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,083
Mike, nice to meet you.

85
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,791
- Nice to meet you.
- And I'm Matt.

86
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,041
- Mm. A pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

87
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,041
Well, I don't know about you young people,
but I'm famished.

88
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:14,416
- There's a restaurant in the hotel lobby.
- Mm. Show us the way?

89
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,333
Sure.

90
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,625
I can't make up my mind
which one is more handsome.

91
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,000
I'd like to play in the US Open.

92
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,458
You might win it.

93
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,833
Would that lead to playing abroad?

94
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,625
In Europe, I mean?

95
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,666
No reason why not. They have to know you
before they invite you.

96
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,750
Would winning the Open
make them know about me?

97
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:36,708
Hell yes!

98
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:40,375
Benny Watts plays in Europe all the time
now that he has his international title.

99
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,041
How's the prize money?

100
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,625
- Pretty good, I think.
- Hm? What's pretty good?

101
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,250
More than in the States.

102
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,208
What about Russia?

103
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,458
The Soviets are murder.

104
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,166
They eat Americans for breakfast there.

105
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,166
I don't think there's been an American
with a prayer against them in 20 years.

106
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:58,666
It's like ballet.

107
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,666
They pay people to play chess.

108
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,750
We should probably go.
We don't wanna be late.

109
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,416
This one's for all the marbles.

110
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,583
Five hundred of them to be exact.

111
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,958
That's Rudolph. He's a master.

112
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,333
Beth cannot be happy
about being crowded into an ending

113
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,583
with a rook, a knight, and three pawns.

114
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,416
It's so complicated.

115
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,000
Uh-oh.

116
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,125
And that's check.

117
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,000
And that's mate.

118
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:52,250
I've allowed 12 dollars
for our celebration supper tonight,

119
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,041
and two dollars for a small breakfast
in the morning.

120
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:59,625
That makes our total expenses,
so far, $172.30.

121
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:02,333
Which leaves over 300 dollars.

122
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:04,708
Beth…

123
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:09,583
I was thinking…

124
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:16,166
Perhaps you could give me 10%,
as an agent's commission?

125
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,541
Let's make it 15%.

126
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,458
Which would be 49 dollars and 54 cents.

127
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,583
They told me at Methuen
you were marvelous at math.

128
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,583
"Schoolgirl beats
Grandmaster in Pittsburgh."

129
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:45,833
"Onlookers were amazed
at her youthful fine points of strategy."

130
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:50,250
"She shows the assurance
of a player twice her age."

131
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,833
That's national recognition, dear.

132
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,500
<i>I'm afraid she's had a bit of a relapse.</i>

133
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,333
The doctor wants to keep her in bed
for a few more days.

134
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,375
I'm sure she'll be better by Monday.

135
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,208
One of the worst colds
I've ever seen in a child.

136
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,333
The poor dear.

137
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,041
We're gonna be late.

138
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:13,791
Yeah.

139
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,500
Lots of liquids.

140
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,041
- Thank you.
<i>- </i>You're welcome.

141
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,916
There's a tournament in Houston
over the holidays, starting on the 26th.

142
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,958
I understand it's very easy
to travel on Christmas Day

143
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,958
since most people are home
eating plum pudding or whatever.

144
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,833
I saw that one, too.

145
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,083
I believe we could fly to Houston,

146
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,208
have a very pleasant
winter vacation in the sun.

147
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:51,916
Do girly things.

148
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,958
I hear they have
a very lovely beauty spa at the hotel.

149
00:11:58,875 --> 00:11:59,708
Yes, Mother.

150
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,583
She has a fever of 101.

151
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,958
Must be the flu.

152
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,166
She won't be back
until after the holidays.

153
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,833
They're calling you a wunderkind.

154
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,791
I might have to start keeping a scrapbook.

155
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,250
How's your meal?

156
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,916
This might be
the best Christmas I've ever had.

157
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,375
Is that a martini?

158
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,166
Gibson.

159
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,750
I find the onion
slightly more refined than the olive.

160
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,791
I should probably learn
how to speak Russian.

161
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,000
Do they teach that at Fairfield?

162
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,416
I'd have to take a night class
at the junior college.

163
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,375
The kids would all be older than you.

164
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,208
And by kids, I mean boys.

165
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,375
<i>They say you're the real thing.</i>

166
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,541
That's it, honey,
hold it up so we can see it.

167
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,625
So, can you tell
the readers of <i>Life</i> how it feels?

168
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,625
I mean, to be a girl among all those men?

169
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,583
I don't mind it.

170
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:05,958
Isn't it intimidating?

171
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:09,666
I mean, when I was a girl,
I wasn't allowed to be competitive.

172
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,583
I played with dolls.

173
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:14,458
- Chess isn't always competitive.
- No, but you play to win.

174
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:17,375
Yes, but chess can also be…

175
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,083
What?

176
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:21,958
Beautiful.

177
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,125
You're an orphan, Beth.

178
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,791
Yes, I know that.

179
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:33,416
No, yes, of course you do.
I was wondering how you learned to play.

180
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,666
Mr. Shaibel taught me.

181
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,375
He was the janitor at Methuen.

182
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,958
A janitor taught you how to play?

183
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,208
- Really?
- When I was eight.

184
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,166
I imagine…

185
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,666
It must have been such a distraction
from life in such a depressing place.

186
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,208
You must have been very lonely.

187
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,500
I'm fine being alone.

188
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,333
Do you imagine
that you saw the king as a father,

189
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,583
and the queen as a mother?

190
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,375
I mean, one to attack, one to protect?

191
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,541
They're just pieces.

192
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:11,000
And it was the board I noticed first.

193
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:11,916
The board?

194
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:13,625
Yes.

195
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:17,666
It's an entire world of just 64 squares.

196
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,416
I feel…

197
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,375
Safe in it.

198
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,625
I can control it, I can dominate it.

199
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:28,791
And it's predictable.

200
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,166
So, if I get hurt,
I only have myself to blame.

201
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,583
How interesting.

202
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,958
Tell me, Elizabeth.

203
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,666
Have you ever heard
of something called apophenia?

204
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,375
No, what's that?

205
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:49,625
It's the finding of pattern or meaning
where other people don't.

206
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:56,083
Sometimes, people with this condition
get feelings of revelation or ecstasies.

207
00:15:56,916 --> 00:16:01,250
Sometimes, people find patterns or meaning
where there aren't any.

208
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,916
Hm. What does that have to do with me?

209
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,291
Creativity and psychosis
often go hand in hand.

210
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,166
Or, for that matter, genius and madness.

211
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,541
You think I'm crazy?

212
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,250
- No, of course not. I was just asking...
- I think that's enough.

213
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,416
Beth has homework to finish.

214
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,625
She is, after all,
still a young woman in school.

215
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:26,833
- Just like all the other kids her age.
- Of course.

216
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,583
- It was an honor to meet you.
- Thanks.

217
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,166
You know…

218
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,333
You might try bridge.

219
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:38,208
- I hear a lot of chess players enjoy it.
- I'll show you out.

220
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,583
"With some people, chess is a pastime."

221
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,583
"With others, it is a compulsion,
even an addiction."

222
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,125
"And every now and then,
a person comes along

223
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,458
for whom it is a birthright."

224
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:01,916
<i>"Now and then, a small boy appears
and dazzles us with his precocity,</i>

225
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,041
<i>at what may be
the world's most difficult game."</i>

226
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,208
"But what if that boy were a girl?"

227
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:13,250
"A young, unsmiling girl, with brown eyes,
red hair, and a dark blue dress?"

228
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,833
We started a chess club.

229
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,166
<i>"Into the male-dominated world</i>

236
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,166
Where was I?

237
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,250
It's all Greek, all of a sudden.

238
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,416
It's okay, I've heard enough.

239
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:50,916
I don't know why my body
is so intent on sabotaging my brain,

240
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,750
when my brain is perfectly capable
of sabotaging itself.

241
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,083
It's mostly about my being a girl.

242
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,416
Well, you are one.

243
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,083
It shouldn't be that important.

244
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,291
They didn't print half the things I said.

245
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,125
They didn't tell about Mr. Shaibel,

246
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:10,291
and they didn't say anything
about how I play the Sicilian.

247
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,583
Beth, dear, it makes you a celebrity.

248
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,333
Yeah, for being a girl.

249
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,208
Did you ever think maybe
it's the drinking that's making you sick?

250
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:25,875
Oh, please.

251
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,875
I've flirted with alcohol most of my life.

252
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,000
If anything, I think it's high time
I consummated the relationship.

253
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,583
To motherhood.

254
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:44,916
Beth?

255
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:47,916
We're having a pledge party,

256
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,416
Friday night, my house.

257
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,875
The other Apple Pis
asked me to invite you.

258
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,166
- Friday night?
- 7:30.

259
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:56,958
Can you make it?

260
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:53,250
<i>It was really something to see you</i>
<i>in the newspaper all those times.</i>

261
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,708
All those places you've been,
which was your favorite?

262
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:57,875
I liked Houston.

263
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:07,208
But now that my rating's up to 1800,
I hope to go to Las Vegas

264
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,583
to play in the US Open next month.

265
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,208
What about the boys?

266
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:12,958
Are they good-looking?

267
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,708
Do you date any of them?

268
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:19,083
- There's not really much time for that.
- But if you had the time…

269
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,333
Is there anyone you've met
that you'd like to…

270
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,750
Trade rooks with, or whatever?

271
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,666
I mean, I trade rooks all the time,
but it's not...

272
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,208
I bet you do.

00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,375
I love this song. Turn it up.

278
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,291
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

280
00:23:59,041 --> 00:23:59,916

That is you.

My stars! You look…

283
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:07,125
Wow!

284
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:08,916
Thanks.

You're welcome.

286

I thought we might bump into each other

287
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:16,541
when I saw your name
on the tournament list.

288
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,500
- I didn't see yours.
- I'm not playing.

289
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,875
<i>Chess Review</i> sent me to write it up.

290
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:24,583
Must confess,
I was hoping to see you here last year.

291
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:25,833
I was supposed to.

292
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:28,083
I even paid the fee,
but my mother got sick.

293
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:31,000
- And I didn't want to come alone.
- She all right?

294
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,333
Fine.

295
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:33,875
I should have come on my own,

296
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:37,666
but I told myself that the Open's
not as important as the US Championships.

297
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,208
Oh, no. No, it's not.

298
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:41,500
But I'm sure glad you came.

299
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:44,375
It's probably a good idea for me to play

300
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:46,916
in something other
than the events I pick for the money.

301
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,625
- Looks like you're making a lot.
- Yeah, I guess so.

302
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,958
Still, you could become
a world-class player, be a real pro.

303
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:59,125
- I started taking Russian at night.
- Oh, that's smart.

304
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,125
Don't wanna plateau.

305
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:05,125
No, plateaus are the worst.

306
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:08,041
And you're far too old
to be called a prodigy anymore.

307
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,333
I should do something on you
for the magazine.

308
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:16,416
- I was on the cover last month.
- Of course.

309
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,375
I must have got it mixed up
with the one in <i>Life</i> magazine.

310
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:23,250
I also work for the <i>Herald-Leader.</i>

311
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:24,250
In Lexington?

312
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:26,208
I could do a half-page
on you for Sunday's paper.

313
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:29,333
- Won't be as big a deal as <i>Life, </i>but...
- Yeah, sure.

314
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:31,333
If you want to.

315
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:33,375
I got a camera in my room.

316
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:35,250
In your room?

317
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:38,541
Chess boards, too. We could play.

318
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,833
Okay.

319
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,041
Let's go up.

320
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:12,166
Why don't you sit over by the window?

321
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:18,791
- Uh, may I…
- Oh, yeah, just toss them.

322
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,791
I wasn't ready.

323
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:33,041
You look great.

324
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:38,291
Scooch to your left.

325
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:43,041
That's right.

326
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:48,666
Say…

327
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:50,458
"Ruy Lopez."

328
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,083
You could go by the board.

329
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:11,916
Okay.

330
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,000
I see you've done this before.

331
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:18,458
Do you want me to play?

332
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:20,166
Sure. Black to move.

333
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,250
All right, slow down.

334
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:34,666
Yeah, that's more my-my speed.

335
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:40,000
Um…

336
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,125
You've grown up, Harmon.

337
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:51,916
You've even gotten good-looking.

338
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:58,166
- I don't even know your first name.
- Everyone calls me Townes.

339
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:02,375
Maybe that's why I call you Harmon,
instead of Elizabeth.

340
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:04,375
It's Beth.

341
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:07,416
I like Harmon.

342
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:55,875
Oh, hi.

343
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:58,458
- Roger.
- I'm not interrupting, am I?

344
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:01,708
Th-That's okay. Uh, we're just…

345
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,458
Beth Harmon, this is Roger Dione.

346
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:08,125
Harmon? The chess prodigy.

347
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:11,083
- I've heard so much about you.
- Nice to meet you.

348
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,791
I thought you were gonna play
some baccarat?

349
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:17,541
Thought I'd quit while
I was behind and go read by the pool.

350
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:20,208
You two carry on.
I'll be gone in a minute.

351
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:30,000
- Let's play chess.
- Okay.

352
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:36,125
Thanks.

353
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:43,625
Right.

354
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,208
Here we go.

355
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:51,333
Pleasure to meet you, Beth.

356
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,083
You too.

357
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:56,125
Dinner's at nine.

358
00:29:57,833 --> 00:29:58,666
Don't forget.

359
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:10,291
<i>Marge, did your aunt</i>
<i>leave you everything?</i>

360
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:12,500
<i>I was her only heir.</i>

361
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:13,958
Where have you been, honey?

362
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,541
You've been gone for hours.

363
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:19,458
- Playing chess.
<i>- I don't wanna talk about it.</i>

364
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:21,166
- Practicing.
<i>- Okay.</i>

365
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:24,000
That's all?

366
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:26,791
Yeah, that's all.

367
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:30,708
<i>Well, it's the perfume I use</i>
<i>that makes me smell so nice.</i>

368
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:33,750
Do me a favor
and hand me a beer on the desk?

369
00:30:35,916 --> 00:30:36,958
<i>What do you want?</i>

370
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:40,250
<i> I think I've got one.</i>
<i>I think I've got a gimmick.</i>

371
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:44,333
<i>A gimmick is an angle that works for you.</i>

372
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:46,750
<i>To keep you
from working too hard for yourself.</i>

373
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:50,250
<i>- Simple.</i>
<i>- Specifically, what is your angle?</i>

374
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:51,500
<i>Specifically…</i>

375
00:30:53,708 --> 00:30:55,416
I suppose you've never had beer.

376
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,250
- <i>All right, Sam.</i>
- Here.

377
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:03,875
<i>Come here.</i>

378
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:09,291
<i>My father used to work here
as a mill hand.</i>

379
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:14,291
- <i>So did mine. When he was sober.</i>
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not so fast.

380
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:15,416
<i>Now, you're even.</i>

381
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,125
<i>Now, I'm even.</i>

382
00:31:17,916 --> 00:31:21,083
<i>I was 21 when I took it over.
It had 3,000 workers then.</i>

383
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:22,708
<i>It's got 30,000 now.</i>

384
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:26,208
<i>Ran as far as that gate,
now it goes down to the edge of the river.</i>

385
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:28,750
<i>And I did it all by myself.</i>

386
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:31,916
<i>- Without Walter, without...</i>
- I'd like another.

387
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:35,666
- <i>All by myself.</i>
- You really shouldn't.

388
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,708
<i>Half of this should make quite a score.</i>

389
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:40,791
All right.

390
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:43,708
But if you're gonna have one,
get me one, too.

391
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:45,833
<i>That's what I had in mind.</i>

392
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:48,958
<i>You went out of here</i>
<i>a dirty kid once before,</i>

393
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,291
<i>that can happen again.</i>

394
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:53,458
<i>Escape from clothesline drudgery,</i>

395
00:31:53,541 --> 00:31:55,208
<i>but listen to Jinx first.</i>

396
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,041
<i>When you buy</i>
<i>your dryer, be sure you get the best kind,</i>

397
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,583
<i>a gas dryer.</i>

398
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:03,625
<i>Your most delicate fabrics
are safe in a gas dryer.</i>

399
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:10,000
<i>See? A gentle stream of warm air
sends the clothes' moisture away.</i>

400
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:23,375
<i>My first match</i>
<i>was against this guy from Oklahoma.</i>

401
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:26,666
<i>It was all over in two dozen moves.</i>

402
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,583
Ouch.

403
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:30,458
Then, this guy from San Francisco.

404
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:32,125
I played the Marshall.

405
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:37,291
Um, sacrificed my queen,
the way that Paul Morphy did one time.

406
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:38,916
Mm-hm. One more.

407
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,041
What about, um…

408
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:43,791
What's his name?
The one you told me about.

409
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:45,041
Bobby something?

410
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:48,416
- Benny Watts.
- Yes, him.

411
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,041
No losses, but one draw.

412
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:53,541
Queens Gambit Declined
is so well respected.

413
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:55,583
<i>I've seen him a couple of times.</i>

414
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:57,666
<i>Always got a crowd around him.</i>

415
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,250
Well, of course, he's the US Champion.

416
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:01,291
He's Benny Watts.

417
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:05,708
<i>Some people say</i>
<i>he's the most talented American player</i>

418
00:33:05,791 --> 00:33:06,625
<i>since Morphy.</i>

419
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:09,625
<i>I read about a game
he played in Copenhagen,</i>

420
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:11,208
<i>a draw against Najdorf.</i>

421
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:13,125
<i>That was in 1948,</i>

422
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:15,333
<i>which means that Benny
was eight years old.</i>

423
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:19,916
<i>I've seen a picture of him at 13
in front of a whole bunch of sailors.</i>

424
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:23,416
<i>He played against the entire team
at Annapolis without losing a game.</i>

425
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,333
Sounds like someone else I know.

426
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:28,916
When I was nine,
I was playing Mr. Shaibel in the basement.

427
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:32,708
<i>Anyway, I'm not afraid of him.</i>

428
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:35,166
I don't suppose
there's anyone you're afraid of.

429
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:38,708
There is one player that scares me.

430
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:41,458
Who?

431
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:43,250
The Russian.

432
00:33:45,416 --> 00:33:46,250
Borgov.

433
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,916
<i>It's a lot more</i>
<i>of a dynamic game than the Caro.</i>

434
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,958
Which is not the case
with QGD versus Slav.

435
00:34:04,541 --> 00:34:05,500
You're Beth Harmon.

436
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:08,000
Yes.

437
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:11,250
I saw the piece in <i>Life.</i>

438
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:16,333
Game they printed, that was a pretty one.
The one with you and Beltik.

439
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:17,666
Thank you.

440
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:21,125
I'm, uh, Benny Watts.

441
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:22,041
I know.

442
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:25,375
We met a couple of years ago
in Cincinnati.

443
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:27,041
Didn't meet, but we spoke.

444
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:30,708
- Cincinnati?
- You didn't play that year.

445
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:34,583
Okay, I'll take your word for it.

446
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:37,166
Guess I'll see you tomorrow.

447
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:39,666
You shouldn't have castled.

448
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:43,375
In your game with Beltik.

449
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,833
I needed to get the rook out.

450
00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:51,041
Well, you could have lost your advantage.

451
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:53,500
I don't think so.

452
00:34:56,708 --> 00:34:59,541
He plays pawn-takes-pawn.
You can't take back.

453
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:03,000
- Wait a minute.
- I can't.

454
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:05,833
I got an adjournment I gotta go play.
But set it up, think it out.

455
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,708
Your problem is your queen knight.

456
00:35:08,791 --> 00:35:12,458
I don't want to set it up
and think it out.

457
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:41,666
<i>Beltik could have beat me.</i>

458
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,333
But he didn't.

459
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:45,333
Yes, but he could have.

460
00:35:45,416 --> 00:35:47,291
What's worse is I didn't even see it.

461
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:51,458
Benny Watts, just by reading
about a player he knows nothing about,

462
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:52,666
he picks it up.

463
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:57,291
I was so proud of myself
when I found an error in a Morphy game,

464
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:59,208
and now someone's done it to me.

465
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:02,458
Stop thinking about
what might have happened in the past,

466
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:03,791
and get some sleep.

467
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:10,791
So stupid!

468
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:38,166
Pawn to bishop four, right?

469
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:40,625
Yes.

470
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:41,791
<i>I thought he could see</i>
<i>what I was planning.</i>

471
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:53,958
<i>I thought he could hear my heart beating,
and know how panicked I was.</i>

472
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:01,083
<i>He still had time to get out of it.</i>

473
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,500
<i>But he took the piece just as I planned.</i>

474
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:12,791
I went into that game
with a perfect score.

475
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:17,666
Benny had two draws,
so a draw would give me the title.

476
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:20,791
I wanted to win.

477
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:23,375
I wanted to hammer his weaknesses.

478
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:25,416
I wanted to show that pirate
that I could beat him,

479
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,541
even though I didn't play
the way he thought I should.

480
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,750
<i>Then, he captured my center pawn,
my protected pawn,</i>

481
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:35,208
the pawn that had held his queen
to her corner for most of the game.

482
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:37,541
I don't understand.

483
00:39:38,791 --> 00:39:40,916
He forced an exchange of queens.

484
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:43,000
Oh.

485
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:44,083
Couldn't believe it.

486
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:47,625
<i>And then I saw what it meant.</i>

487
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:51,291
<i>With the pawn gone,
I was open to a rook-bishop mate,</i>

488
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:53,500
<i>because of the bishop
on the open diagonal.</i>

489
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,333
<i>I could protect my retreating knight
by moving one of the rooks over,</i>

490
00:39:57,416 --> 00:39:59,208
<i>but the protection wouldn't last,</i>

491
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:01,375
<i>because his fucking,
innocent-looking knight</i>

492
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:02,791
<i>would block my king's escape.</i>

493
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:05,916
<i>The more I looked,
the worse it all became.</i>

494
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
<i>Caught me completely off guard.</i>

495
00:40:08,541 --> 00:40:10,375
It was brutal.

496
00:40:11,916 --> 00:40:13,916
It's the kind of thing
I did to other people.

497
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:17,041
Kind of thing that Morphy did,
and I missed it.

498
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,708
I'd been thinking about doubled pawns.

499
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,250
You were thinking about winning.

500
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:26,333
What did you do?

501
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,000
I needed a counterthreat.

502
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:33,750
<i>A move that would stop him in his tracks,
but there wasn't any.</i>

503
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:36,250
<i>I spent half an hour studying the board,</i>

504
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:39,416
<i>and decided that Benny's move
was even sounder than I thought.</i>

505
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:42,375
<i>I thought maybe
I could trade my way out of it</i>

506
00:40:42,458 --> 00:40:43,916
<i>if he attacked too fast, but…</i>

507
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:45,833
<i>He was careful.</i>

508
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,958
<i>I had to retreat, but he kept coming.</i>

509
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:57,750
<i>I wanted to scream.</i>

510
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,041
You resign, now.

511
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,291
Tough game.

512
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:40,458
You'll split the prize money.

513
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:42,666
You'll be co-champions.

514
00:41:43,291 --> 00:41:46,208
You will still get a trophy,
albeit a smaller one.

515
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,458
It happens all the time.

516
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:50,208
I made some inquiries.

517
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:53,666
- The Open Championship is often shared.
- I didn't see what he was doing.

518
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:57,958
You can't finesse everything all the time.

519
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:00,291
Nobody can.

520
00:42:00,916 --> 00:42:02,416
You don't know anything about chess.

521
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:07,500
- I know what it feels like to lose.
- Yeah, I bet you do.

522
00:42:11,958 --> 00:42:13,333
And now you do, too.

523
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:28,791
Harmon!

524
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:30,250
I'm sorry.

525
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:31,250
Why?

526
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:36,958
I know how badly you wanted to beat Benny.

527
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:39,541
You'll get another shot.

528
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:41,666
Doesn't matter.

529
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,000
Give my best to Roger.

530
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:46,708
Beth.
