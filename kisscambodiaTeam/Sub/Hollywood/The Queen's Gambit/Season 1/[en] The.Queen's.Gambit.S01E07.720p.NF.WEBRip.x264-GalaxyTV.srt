1
00:00:07,916 --> 00:00:11,166
<i>You know, most times when people</i>
<i>tell us something's for the best,</i>

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,208
<i>it's for the worst.</i>

3
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:14,833
This time it's true, okay?

4
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:19,208
I'll be right back.

5
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:39,125
Hi, my name is Alice.

6
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,083
Um, is Paul home?

7
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,833
- I'm sorry, ma'am, this isn't a good time.
- Hey, what's going on?

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,541
- Paul, who is that?
- I'm...

9
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,458
Take Christopher back inside
right now.

10
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,958
- What are you doing here?
- I came to say you were right.

11
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:53,875
I was wrong.

12
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:57,791
- Beth's in the car, just so you are aware.
- No, Jesus! Alice!

13
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:00,458
It's been five years.
You can't just show up here!

14
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:04,000
- I came because I can't do this.
- Listen to me.

15
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,541
- Okay, I understand.
- I cannot.

16
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:08,875
- I feel that I am letting her down.
- You cannot be here. Listen to me.

17
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,208
I need you to get back in the car,
and you'll come back.

18
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:13,083
- We'll talk another time.
- We can't.

19
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,291
- We can talk now.
- No, we can't talk now.

20
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,208
No, you shouldn't have brought her here!

21
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:19,791
- Why did you bring her here?
- Because I need your help!

22
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:22,208
It's too late! Please go.

23
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,250
Mama?

24
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,041
Who was that?

25
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:51,958
A mistake.

26
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,833
A-A rounding error.

27
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,833
It's just a problem I gotta solve.

28
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:01,500
What problem?

29
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,333
What I do with you.

30
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,875
This whole house belong to you?

31
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:18,625
You're no orphan.

32
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:20,791
Not anymore.

33
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,583
You've been in Lexington this whole time?

34
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,083
Uh, Louisville.

35
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,458
What brought you back here?

36
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,416
You don't seem
to like answering your phone.

37
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,291
Mr. Shaibel died.

38
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,041
There's a funeral day after tomorrow.
I thought…

39
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,583
We could go together.

40
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:00,208
Thank you.

41
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,208
Mm.

42
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:08,958
God, Beth.

43
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:11,875
Yeah.

44
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,625
I know.

45
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,541
I'm working as a paralegal.

46
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,125
- You went to college?
- I did, Kentucky State.

47
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,833
I got a Physical Education scholarship.

48
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,166
But when I found out
the school used to be called

49
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,458
the State Normal School
for Colored Persons,

50
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,708
it made me want to study history,

51
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:33,833
which pissed me off
way more than I already was.

52
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,750
That's hard to imagine.

53
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,458
I switched my major to Poli-Sci.

54
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,875
I'm saving up for law school.

55
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,583
I know, me, a lawyer,

56
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,291
but the world is fucked up.

57
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:50,375
And if I'm gonna change it,
I can't spend all my time

58
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,125
teaching white girls
how to hold a badminton racket.

59
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,958
- I'm gonna be a radical.
- Didn't know that was a career choice.

60
00:03:58,791 --> 00:03:59,625
It will be.

61
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,000
Mm-hm.

62
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,375
Hm.

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I still take them.

64
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,333
Looks like you're doing
more than pills, honey.

65
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,166
Haven't had anything today.

66
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,625
Not yet, anyway.

67
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,625
I'm supposed to go to Russia
at the end of the year.

68
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,416
- I'm afraid.
- Then don't go.

69
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,000
I have to go.

70
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,875
If I don't, there's nothing for me to do.
I'll just drink.

71
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,125
Well, looks like you do that anyway.

72
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,125
I need to quit the wine,

73
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,166
and the pills, and…

74
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,333
Clean this place up.

75
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,875
That'd be a good place to start.

76
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,125
I have to study chess eight hours a day.

77
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,583
They want me to play in San Francisco,
be on <i>The Tonight Show</i>.

78
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,875
- I should probably do all of that.
- Who's they?

79
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,250
Chess Federation.

80
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,333
Oh.

81
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,166
But what I want…

82
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:19,708
Is a drink.

83
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,208
If you weren't here,
I'd probably have a bottle of wine now.

84
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:28,166
You sound like Susan Hayward
in one of those movies.

85
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,750
I read about this pop artist once.

86
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,500
Bought an original drawing
by Michelangelo.

87
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,333
When he got it home,

88
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,333
he took a piece of art gum, and just…

89
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,125
Erased it…

90
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,125
leaving nothing but a blank page.

91
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,250
I remember being really shocked by that.

92
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,625
Now, I wonder if I haven't
somehow erased my own brain.

93
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,416
Let's pretend that you didn't
just compare yourself to Michelangelo.

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,750
And let's look at where you're at,

95
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,625
which after being here
all of five minutes,

96
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:06,083
looks like it's at the bottom
of a fucking hole.

97
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,625
It's looking a lot
like you dug it yourself.

98
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:09,750
My advice,

99
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,583
stop digging.

100
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,708
Well, maybe it's in my blood.

101
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,750
My mother went crazy.

102
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,583
Went crazy or always was?

103
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,291
I don't know.

104
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,458
She drink or any such?

105
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,208
No, never.

106
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:29,541
She gone.

107
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:33,125
Quit thinking about it.
It's not doing you any good.

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Besides…

109
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:37,833
I got you a present.

110
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,000
It was me all along.

111
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:56,541
I was pissed at you for being adopted.

112
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,791
What about for being
a white trash, cracker bitch?

113
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,291
Who could forget?

114
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,791
How much does a paralegal make, anyway?

115
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:21,291
Not enough to buy this car,
if that's what you're wondering.

116
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,166
Was a gift
from one of the partners at the firm.

117
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,625
- Was it, now?
- Mm-hm.

118
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,291
He wants to marry me,

119
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,750
soon as he divorces
the wife he's already got.

120
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,416
Sounds like a real peach.

121
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,583
He's white, too.

122
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,625
Rick, his name is.
He's teaching me how to play squash.

123
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:43,666
Squash?

124
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,416
A game rich white people play.

125
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,916
I bet you'd be good at it.

126
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:52,083
Whole firm is white.
They hired me to keep up with the times.

127
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:56,750
Instead of the usual Black cleaning woman,
they wanted a clean, Black woman,

128
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:59,458
with a nice ass and a good vocabulary.

129
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,708
- And you are very clean.
- Mm.

130
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,000
When I did the interview,

131
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:07,333
I made sure to use a lot of words
like "reprehensible" and "dichotomy."

132
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,125
They perked right up.

133
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:13,000
But I'm gone the second I pass the bar.

134
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,166
What I want is what you got.

135
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,541
You've been the best
at what you do for so long,

136
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,000
you don't even know
what it's like for the rest of us.

137
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:33,208
So, what will your fellow radicals think?
You being with a rich white lawyer?

138
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,291
Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.

139
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:48,916
A trailer?

140
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,083
Wow, you really were the gold standard

141
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,708
for white-trash girls everywhere,
weren't you?

142
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,500
My mama came from money.

143
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,458
Then she married into more of it.

144
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,791
Then how did y'all end up way out here?

145
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,375
It's complicated.

146
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,250
I'll say.

147
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,333
You wanna go in?

148
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,708
Throw some rocks through the windows?

149
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,833
<i>Choices have consequences.</i>

150
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,416
No more chess.

151
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,916
<i>You're here</i>
<i>because your parents made certain choices.</i>

152
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,000
<i>You will need to learn</i>

153
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,333
<i>to make different choices.</i>

154
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:07,000
I just realized I don't ever
wanna go back in there again.

155
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:10,958
<i>"Come to me,</i>

156
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,458
all who are weary and burdened,
and I will give you rest."

157
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,166
"Take my yoke upon you,

158
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:19,875
and learn from me,

159
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,875
for I am gentle and humble at heart."

160
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,541
Mrs. Deardorff isn't here.

161
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,833
None of them are.

162
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,000
Deardorff fell and broke her hip.

163
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,500
Right after you left.

164
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,916
She had to walk with a cane after.

165
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:35,916
Was never the same.

166
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,541
Made me almost believe in God.

167
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,333
I didn't know William Shaibel,

168
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,583
but I'm told he was not a religious man,
so much as a solitary man.

169
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,500
None of them are crying.

170
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,583
And I'm told that for the past 23 years…

171
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,458
They all look like
they're waiting in line at the bank.

172
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,958
- …Methuen Home for girls…
- You okay?

173
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,125
- He performed his duties…
- I feel bad.

174
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,583
…quietly and diligently.

175
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,291
I owed him ten dollars.

176
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,875
Shh!

177
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:08,791
Jolene.

178
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:12,083
The director of the Methuen Home,
Helen Deardorff, says that…

179
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,708
He was beloved by the staff
and students alike,

180
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:19,208
that he had an admirable work ethic.

181
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,208
I changed my mind.

182
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,416
I'll only be a minute.

183
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,250
You should be in chapel, young lady.

184
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,208
Yes, ma'am.

185
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,250
Beth?

186
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,375
Oh, honey.

187
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,791
Aw, did you bite off
more than you can chew?

188
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,125
Aw, it's okay.

189
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,958
Shh. It's all right.

190
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,083
What we would really like
from you, Elizabeth,

191
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,208
would be some kind of statement.

192
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:08,958
Statement?

193
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:13,083
Christian Crusade would like you
to make your position public,

194
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,208
in a world where so many keep silent.

195
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,041
What position is that?

196
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:22,166
As we know, the spread of communism

197
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,708
is also the spread of atheism.

198
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:26,833
I suppose so.

199
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,666
Oh, it's not a matter of supposing.

200
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:33,041
It's a matter of fact,
of Marxist-Leninist fact.

201
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,500
The Holy Word is anathema to the Kremlin,

202
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,166
and the atheists who sit there.

203
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,958
- I have no quarrel with that.
- Good.

204
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,791
What we want
is a statement to that effect.

205
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,541
- To the press?
- Exactly.

206
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,000
We had something prepared. There you go.

207
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,708
I'm a chess player.

208
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,916
Of course you are.
But you're also a Christian.

209
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,458
I'm not sure about that.

210
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,416
I have no intention
of saying anything like this.

211
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,833
- Why not?
- Because it's fucking nonsense?

212
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:16,500
Christian Crusade
has already invested a good deal of money.

213
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,625
We paid
for your last trip to San Francisco.

214
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,291
We were all very proud of you.

215
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:26,000
And we've already spent a good deal more
on your upcoming trip to the Soviet Union.

216
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:26,916
Okay.

217
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:29,541
Fine.

218
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,041
I'll give it all back.

219
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,666
I hope you know what you're doing, dear.

220
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,083
<i>Oh, it's official now.</i>

221
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,000
You're crazy.

222
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,375
You are out of your fucking mind.

223
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,125
<i>Maybe. Probably.</i>

224
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,375
But I did it,
and it's too late to undo it.

225
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,333
- Are the tickets paid for?
<i>- No.</i>

226
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,166
Nothing's paid for.

227
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,166
You understand you gotta pay Intourist
for the hotel in advance?

228
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,125
<i>I know that.</i>

229
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,125
I have 2,000 in my bank account.

230
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:16,458
It would be more,
but I've been keeping up the house.

231
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:20,625
<i>It's gonna take a thousand more
to do it, at least that.</i>

232
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,708
<i>- I was wondering...</i>
- I don't have it.

233
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,875
What do you mean?

234
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,625
- You've got money.
<i>- I don't have it.</i>

235
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,666
Did you gamble it all away?

236
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,208
What difference does it make?

237
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,875
You can call the Federation
or the State Department.

238
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,041
The Federation doesn't like me.

239
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,458
They think I haven't done as much
for chess as I could've.

240
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,416
Should have gone on <i>Tonight,</i>
<i>Phil Donahue</i>…

241
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,791
Benny, come on.
I don't wanna go to Russia by myself.

242
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,916
- Benny?
<i>- Are you kidding me?</i>

243
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,708
- What?
- First, you don't come back to New York,

244
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,041
and you basically tell me

245
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,125
that you'd rather be a drunk
than be with me.

246
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:04,916
<i>Now you pull this crap?</i>

247
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
No, you can fucking well go alone.

248
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,833
Maybe I shouldn't have done it.

249
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,541
<i>Maybe I didn't have
to give the money back.</i>

250
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,041
Maybe? Maybe is a loser's word, Beth.

251
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,833
- Benny…
- Don't call me anymore.

252
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,500
<i>What money the Federation</i>
<i>has comes from the magazine.</i>

253
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,750
<i>Four hundred dollars
is the most we could possibly spare.</i>

254
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,750
<i>State Department, please hold.</i>

255
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,791
- Thought you said you could play.
- I said I'm learning.

256
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:59,333
<i>- Cultural Affairs, O'Malley speaking.</i>
- Hello?

257
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,958
Oh, my God, I won!

258
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,708
<i>Three thousand dollars?</i>

259
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,125
Yes, straight away.

260
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,708
<i>I'll see what I can do.</i>

261
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,333
<i>- I'll get back to you in an hour.</i>
- An hour?

262
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,083
<i>No dice.</i>

263
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:19,833
<i>I'm terribly sorry.</i>

264
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,000
<i>There's no way government funds
can be handed out to you</i>

265
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,333
<i>without more time and approval.</i>

266
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,875
Don't you have some petty cash
or something?

267
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,291
I don't need funds
to undermine the government in Moscow.

268
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,208
I just need…

269
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,875
Money for my trip.

270
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,416
<i>I'm sorry. I'm really sorry,</i>

271
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:42,166
<i>but we will be sending
one of our men with you.</i>

272
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:43,625
<i>Keep you safe.</i>

273
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:45,958
Keep me safe?

274
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:50,083
- I shouldn't have bought the house.
- Or all those dresses.

275
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,166
Three thousand is a lot.

276
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,333
It's expensive to go to Moscow.

277
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,250
I'll give it to you.

278
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:04,375
What?

279
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,416
No, you just said it's a lot of money.

280
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,875
I have it and more. I've been saving.

281
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:13,958
You need it for law school.

282
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:15,875
I do.

283
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,000
And you'll give it back…

284
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,833
When you win.

285
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:21,958
What if I don't win?

286
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:23,958
It's still worth it.

287
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,000
Or you could give me the black dress.

288
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:32,250
Or the purple one. I like them both.

289
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:38,916
You're like…

290
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:42,041
My guardian angel.

291
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:45,250
For crying out loud.

292
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,208
Hey, Beth.

293
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:47,791
Fuck you.

294
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:52,458
Shaibel isn't the only one
who kept after you all these years.

295
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:57,000
I know how you lost to Benny Watts
in Vegas and then beat him in Ohio.

296
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,458
I read the papers.

297
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:04,666
Even on a group trip into town,
I spent my ice cream money

298
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:08,208
on the damn chess magazine
had your ugly face on it.

299
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,416
For a time,

300
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:13,875
I was all you had.

301
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:16,750
And for a time,

302
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,250
you was all I had.

303
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,666
We weren't orphans.

304
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:27,000
Not as long as we had each other.
You understand what I'm saying?

305
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,291
I'm not your guardian angel.

306
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,625
I'm not here to save you.

307
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,791
Hell, I can barely save me.

308
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:40,041
I'm here because you need me to be here.

309
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,125
That's what family does.

310
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,583
That's what we are.

311
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,958
Someday, I might need you.

312
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,666
It's doubtful.

313
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,125
But you never know.

314
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:57,083
But if I do…

315
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:00,083
You'll come, won't you?

316
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:02,541
I might.

317
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,333
You been to Russia before?

318
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:31,750
Have you?

319
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,625
Once or twice.

320
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,041
There's a few rules.

321
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:44,791
One, stay in your hotel
at all times unless you're with me.

322
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:48,333
Two, do not answer your door
or your phone, unless it's me.

323
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:50,666
How will I know it's you
if I don't answer it?

324
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,333
Three,

325
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:53,750
no drinking.

326
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:56,500
You just offered me a drink.

327
00:24:57,416 --> 00:24:58,625
That was a test.

328
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,791
Let me know if any of the Russian players
tries to speak with you.

329
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:06,083
In particular, Vasily Borgov.

330
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:08,916
He sends a signal in any way,
or sends a note,

331
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:11,333
I wanna know immediately.

332
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:13,958
What exactly would a signal look like?

333
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,166
Could be anything.

334
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:21,250
- He could do it in one of your matches.
- How?

335
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:23,000
I don't know.

336
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:25,291
I don't play chess.

337
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:28,541
Just be on the lookout.

338
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:30,833
I'm told they may wanna talk.

339
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:34,333
Talk about what?

340
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:42,625
What part of the State Department
did you say you were from again?

341
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:08,833
That the chess player?

342
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,666
She looks like Ann-Margret.

343
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:22,333
Let's hope the Russians like redheads.

344
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,125
This is definitely better than mine.

345
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:18,916
Remember, stay in your room at all times.

346
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,083
Do not leave the hotel
unless you're with me.

347
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:22,250
I'll get you in the morning.

348
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:25,208
Will you knock two times fast
and one time slow?

349
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:27,000
Good one.

350
00:27:27,708 --> 00:27:28,625
Welcome to Russia.

351
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,166
Yes.

352
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,750
This will do nicely.

353
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:53,875
In the words of Thomas Huxley,

354
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:56,166
"The chessboard is the world,

355
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,541
<i>the pieces are
the phenomena of the Universe,</i>

356
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:01,000
<i>the rules of the game</i>

357
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:03,416
<i>are what we call the laws of Nature,</i>

358
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,458
<i>and the player on the other side</i>

359
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:09,958
<i>is hidden from us."</i>

360
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,791
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, dear comrades,</i>

361
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:18,708
<i>please welcome…</i>

362
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:21,291
<i>Elizabeth Harmon...</i>

363
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,291
Thank you.

364
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:54,833
<i>As far as</i>
<i>they knew, Harmon wasn't at their level.</i>

365
00:29:54,916 --> 00:29:56,458
<i>Someone like Laev</i>

366
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:59,208
<i>probably didn't spend a lot of time
preparing for their match.</i>

367
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:03,083
Elizabeth Harmon's not at all
an important player by their standards.

368
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:06,583
<i>The only unusual thing about her,
really, is her sex.</i>

369
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:10,166
<i>And even that's not unique in Russia.
There's Nona Gaprindashvili,</i>

370
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:13,916
<i>but she's the female world champion
and has never faced men.</i>

371
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,666
<i>My guess is
Laev was expecting an easy win,</i>

372
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:20,125
<i>and not at all the 27-move thrashing
Beth Harmon just gave him.</i>

373
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:45,833
Um, yeah.

374
00:32:49,541 --> 00:32:51,041
Um…

375
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,000
Yeah? Okay.

376
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:54,916
Um…

377
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:04,125
<i>Beth Harmon's games</i>
<i>with Hellstrom and Shapkin were rigorous,</i>

378
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:07,041
<i>and I'm sure,
for the young American, rather exhausting.</i>

379
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:10,333
<i>But there was a solidity
to her opening moves</i>

380
00:33:10,416 --> 00:33:12,625
<i>that she was able to maintain
through the middlegame,</i>

381
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:15,041
<i>and on to the point each of them resigned.</i>

382
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,958
<i>Hellstrom, it must</i>
<i>be said, clearly took it rather hard.</i>

383
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,750
<i>Didn't speak to Harmon afterwards.</i>

384
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:38,083
<i>Shapkin, however,</i>
<i>was very decent, very civilized,</i>

385
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:39,458
<i>and took his loss with grace,</i>

386
00:33:39,541 --> 00:33:42,666
<i>even though Harmon's win over him
was decisive and merciless.</i>

387
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,916
Vodka?

388
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:57,416
<i>Nyet.</i>

389
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:42,000
<i>Luchenko's the oldest player here,</i>

390
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:44,416
<i>was World Champion
before Elizabeth Harmon was born.</i>

391
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:47,875
<i>He defeated the great Alekhine
in an exhibition when he was a boy,</i>

392
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:51,416
<i>played to a draw with Botvinnik
and crushed Bronstein in Havana.</i>

393
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,000
<i>And while he's no longer
the tiger he once was,</i>

394
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:56,875
<i>he's a dangerous player
when allowed to attack.</i>

395
00:35:57,583 --> 00:35:59,291
<i>Harmon will have to be very careful.</i>

396
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,541
I don't understand.
Did we win, or did we lose?

397
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,333
We adjourned.

398
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,625
Meaning?

399
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:55,166
Meaning we didn't finish.

400
00:36:57,708 --> 00:36:59,333
So, uh…

401
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:01,041
When do we finish?

402
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:02,750
Tomorrow.

403
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:05,750
But right now, we really need some sleep.

404
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:45,583
And maybe she takes with check.

405
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:46,875
He takes back.

406
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:49,208
But then she takes his rook.

407
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:52,750
So what? He's got h5.

408
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:58,333
Yes, that's a nasty pin.

409
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:00,166
And she's done.

410
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:07,416
- Oh, good evening.
- Good evening.

411
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:39,041
Harmon had her 90 minutes of play,
and Luchenko had the same,

412
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:41,791
along with 35 minutes
he had left from the day before.

413
00:39:59,041 --> 00:40:00,625
<i>This put three things against her.</i>

414
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,666
<i>Luchenko having the white pieces,</i>

415
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:07,666
<i>his still unstopped attack…</i>

416
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:11,125
<i>And that extra allotment of time.</i>

417
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,916
<i>So, it was all the more impressive</i>

418
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,625
<i>when she beat him with 25 minutes
still on her clock.</i>

419
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:26,791
Excellent.

420
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:28,708
What a brilliant recovery.

421
00:40:31,416 --> 00:40:34,041
I resign with relief.

422
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:37,541
I've played your games
since I was a small girl.

423
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:39,833
I've always really admired you.

424
00:40:39,916 --> 00:40:41,625
You are how old again?

425
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:44,291
- I'm twenty...
- Oh, no. Don't tell me.

426
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:47,416
It will only drive a stake
through my heart.

427
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:52,000
I went over your games
at this tournament.

428
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:55,666
You are a marvel, my dear.

429
00:40:57,833 --> 00:41:01,875
I may have just played
the best chess player of my life.

430
00:41:05,416 --> 00:41:06,958
You will get used to it.

431
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:12,666
Thank you.

432
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,166
<i>So far, Harmon</i>
<i>is proving to be the biggest attraction</i>

433
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,500
<i>since the Youth Festival in 1957.</i>

434
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:30,875
Some in Moscow are even calling her
an ambassador of sorts.

435
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:33,666
This evening she played
the English opening against Flento,

436
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:37,208
a sequence I've always found
to be like the Sicilian in reverse.

437
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:38,458
<i>He's nowhere near her level,</i>

438
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:41,375
<i>and I don't think she expected
the game to go on for nearly four hours.</i>

439
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,541
<i>But Flento put up quite a fight
along the two main diagonals,</i>

440
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:48,625
<i>and played the Four Knights Variation
with a sophistication that looked,</i>

441
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:51,375
<i>for a while at least,
like it was far beyond Harmon's.</i>

442
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:55,916
<i>But by the middlegame,
she'd traded herself out of that position,</i>

443
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,958
<i>and ultimately forced Flento to resign.</i>

444
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:01,125
The result being

445
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:04,250
she could come to her match
with Borgov tomorrow, exhausted.

446
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,041
<i>You shouldn't have brought her.</i>
<i>Why did you bring her here?</i>

447
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:29,000
- Because I need your help!
- It's too late!

448
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:37,291
- Who was that?
- A mistake.

449
00:42:38,416 --> 00:42:40,083
A-A rounding error.

450
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,833
It's just a problem I gotta solve.

451
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:47,416
<i>What problem?</i>

452
00:42:50,541 --> 00:42:51,625
What I do with you.

453
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,375
Mama?

454
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:06,791
Close your eyes.

455
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:19,166
<i>Elizabeth Harmon plays pawn to Queen four.</i>

456
00:44:19,833 --> 00:44:22,958
<i>Borgov plays pawn to Queen four.</i>

457
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:27,958
Harmon plays pawn to Queen Bishop four.

458
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:29,750
The Queen's Gambit.

459
00:44:29,916 --> 00:44:31,833
Borgov declines,

460
00:44:31,916 --> 00:44:35,375
moves pawn to King four.

461
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:39,750
Borgov's
second move is a bit of a surprise.

462
00:44:39,833 --> 00:44:41,833
Normally, Borgov would do
something more solid,

463
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:45,833
but here, he's going against his own style
and playing a rare line to win.

464
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,708
<i>He must win.</i>

465
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:50,250
<i>Harmon's response
was a complete deviation from the Albin,</i>

466
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:51,916
<i>which must've surprised him right back,</i>

467
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,125
<i>whilst allowing her
to get out into the open.</i>

468
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:58,416
<i>Now, the two of them can fight it out
from here with their own wits.</i>

469
00:45:13,125 --> 00:45:15,500
Knight to G6. Go!

470
00:45:23,666 --> 00:45:25,375
Knight to G6!

471
00:47:08,083 --> 00:47:09,166
Adjourn.

472
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:44,125
Miss Harmon, Miss Harmon!

473
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:48,125
<i>Paris Match, Time Magazine,
The Observer, Reuters, UPI…</i>

474
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:50,666
You're bigger than The Monkees.

475
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:53,750
Please, I just wanna go to sleep.

476
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:55,125
Don't be like that.

477
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,958
It'd be good to talk to them.

478
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,625
Tell them that being in Russia
has made you feel lucky to be an American.

479
00:48:05,833 --> 00:48:07,958
Ms. Harmon!
One question!

480
00:48:08,041 --> 00:48:10,166
Hi, Dick Evans from <i>Time</i>.
Do you have a minute?

481
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:12,666
That depends.
Will you put me on the cover?

482
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:15,708
- Hmm. Are you going to beat him?
- I haven't made any mistakes so far.

483
00:48:15,791 --> 00:48:16,666
Hm. Neither has he.

484
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:19,791
Is it true you learned how to play
at an orphanage when you were two?

485
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:22,125
- I was nine.
- Such a young age. Who taught you?

486
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:26,000
His name was Shaibel.

487
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:27,541
William Shaibel.

488
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:30,000
He was a janitor.
We played in the basement.

489
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:32,625
- The janitor taught you to play chess?
- That's right.

490
00:48:32,708 --> 00:48:34,833
William Shaibel was a fine player.

491
00:48:34,916 --> 00:48:37,375
He spent a lot of time at it,
and he was quite good.

492
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:40,458
Now, will you please
promise to print that?

493
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:42,125
Absolutely. Thank you.

494
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:43,208
Yes, yes. Sure.

495
00:48:43,291 --> 00:48:45,291
Thank you.
If you'll excuse me, I'm very tired.

496
00:48:45,375 --> 00:48:49,208
Excuse me, Miss Harmon,
I'm with the <i>Lexington Herald-Leader.</i>

497
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,500
Our readers back home in Kentucky
would like to know if it's true.

498
00:48:58,166 --> 00:48:59,708
That you're here all by yourself?

499
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:08,333
How did you even get a visa so fast?

500
00:49:08,416 --> 00:49:09,625
The newspaper helped me.

501
00:49:10,291 --> 00:49:11,875
I'm an associate editor now.

502
00:49:12,875 --> 00:49:14,541
And the Moscow Embassy.

503
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:16,500
- Really?
- Yeah.

504
00:49:16,583 --> 00:49:18,666
I'm guessing
they thought I'd distract you.

505
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:21,250
If they only knew.

506
00:49:24,958 --> 00:49:26,708
I know you were angry with me.

507
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:29,666
And I'm sorry.

508
00:49:31,208 --> 00:49:32,666
I should've told you the whole story.

509
00:49:33,416 --> 00:49:34,250
No.

510
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:35,958
I'm sorry.

511
00:49:37,958 --> 00:49:39,083
I should have let you.

512
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:42,708
I will admit…

513
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:44,416
I was a little…

514
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:47,000
Confused.

515
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:50,875
You really are something.

516
00:49:52,791 --> 00:49:55,916
But, um, what I really wanted
was for us to be friends.

517
00:49:58,458 --> 00:50:00,541
And you kind of broke my heart.

518
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,250
I have a way of doing that.

519
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:08,666
Do you forgive me?

520
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:12,708
Clearly.

521
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,708
Consider me your second. What do we need
to do to help you beat Borgov?

522
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:26,291
Well, what I need are…

523
00:50:28,833 --> 00:50:29,708
The pills.

524
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:34,000
The booze. I need my mind cloudy to win.

525
00:50:34,583 --> 00:50:37,208
- I can't visualize the games without them.
- Really?

526
00:50:37,291 --> 00:50:40,833
- You think that's what brought you here?
- I think that's what I'm used to.

527
00:50:40,916 --> 00:50:43,250
Yeah, but you've been doing fine
without all that.

528
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:47,291
- Haven't you?
- Yes, I…

529
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:49,333
Threw away the pills.

530
00:50:50,291 --> 00:50:53,125
And then I asked the front desk
where I could get more.

531
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:55,875
I just really need them right now.

532
00:50:56,625 --> 00:50:57,625
Or I thought I did.

533
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:39,541
Hey.

534
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:43,583
Lady, you were out!

535
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:46,583
What time is it?

536
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:47,666
It's late.

537
00:51:48,208 --> 00:51:49,125
Thank you.

538
00:51:50,583 --> 00:51:52,375
I'll get it. Drink your coffee.

539
00:52:01,625 --> 00:52:03,291
Yes, put him through.

540
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:08,125
You all there?

541
00:52:08,666 --> 00:52:09,500
I'll put her on.

542
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:24,875
- Hello?
- If he goes for the knight,

543
00:52:24,958 --> 00:52:26,333
hit him with a king rook pawn.

544
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:28,083
Benny?

545
00:52:28,166 --> 00:52:30,083
<i>If he goes for the bishop,
do the same thing,</i>

546
00:52:30,166 --> 00:52:31,583
<i>but open up your queen file.</i>

547
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:32,791
How do you know?

548
00:52:32,875 --> 00:52:34,041
<i>It's in the </i>Times.

549
00:52:34,125 --> 00:52:35,041
It's 7 a.m. here,

550
00:52:35,125 --> 00:52:37,250
but we've been working on it
for three hours.

551
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:39,208
We?

552
00:52:42,541 --> 00:52:43,500
Hi, Beth.

553
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:47,625
Hi, Harry.

554
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:50,875
- It's really nice to hear your voice.
<i>- Oh, well, hang on.</i>

555
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,791
Hey, Beth! Hey!

556
00:52:52,875 --> 00:52:53,958
- It's Mike!
- It's Matt!

557
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:55,166
We're so proud of you!

558
00:52:57,416 --> 00:53:00,541
All right. Hey, assholes,
this is costing me a bundle.

559
00:53:00,625 --> 00:53:03,333
Beth, listen to me,
you gotta open up that file, okay?

560
00:53:03,958 --> 00:53:06,125
How do I do that?

561
00:53:06,208 --> 00:53:08,583
There are four ways,
depending on what he does,

562
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:10,500
and we've each been working a way through.

563
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:12,125
You have it handy?

564
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:15,833
Yes, I do. Yes.

565
00:53:15,916 --> 00:53:19,000
<i>Great, okay. Well, let's start
with his knight to rook four.</i>

566
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:21,750
<i>We push that king knight pawn.
You got that?</i>

567
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:23,916
- Yes.
<i>- Great. I'll pass you back to Harry.</i>

568
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:26,583
T <i>here are three things</i>
<i>you might do now.</i>

569
00:53:26,666 --> 00:53:28,583
<i>So, after the queen to knight three,</i>

570
00:53:28,666 --> 00:53:30,666
<i>you play knight to king six,</i>

571
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:35,125
<i>then if he plays rook to rook five,
then you play pawn to king three.</i>

572
00:53:36,666 --> 00:53:40,416
Another variation: If he plays
knight takes pawn on king five,

573
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,833
then you take the rook.

574
00:53:41,916 --> 00:53:44,333
But if he plays rook to rook seven,

575
00:53:44,416 --> 00:53:46,833
<i>check, then play rook to bishop two.</i>

576
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:51,500
Harmon! Harmon!
Harmon! Harmon!

577
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:54,250
Harmon! Harmon! Harmon!

578
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:55,291
<i>Benny?</i>

579
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,125
It's almost five here.

580
00:53:59,833 --> 00:54:00,666
Okay.

581
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:05,250
<i>Go beat him.</i>

582
00:54:14,625 --> 00:54:17,708
<i>Borgov withdraws his queen to G6.</i>

583
00:54:24,583 --> 00:54:27,625
<i>Harmon's knight boldly invades E6.</i>

584
00:54:38,916 --> 00:54:41,791
<i>Borgov attacks Harmon's king-pawn.</i>

585
00:55:21,916 --> 00:55:22,958
Shit.

586
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:28,625
- He's not doing what he's supposed to do.
- Shh!

587
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:31,125
Draw?

588
00:57:31,208 --> 00:57:34,916
Borgov never offers draws,
but he's offering Elizabeth Harmon one.

589
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,333
If she accepts,

590
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:39,458
she leaves the stage in a tie
with the world champion.

591
00:57:39,541 --> 00:57:40,791
If they play on,

592
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:42,875
once the dust settles
and the endgame emerges,

593
00:57:42,958 --> 00:57:45,083
she could find herself
in a very different position.

594
00:57:45,583 --> 00:57:47,333
Borgov is death on endgames.

595
00:57:47,416 --> 00:57:48,625
He's famous for it.

596
00:57:48,708 --> 00:57:50,583
Harmon, on the other hand, is not.

597
00:57:50,666 --> 00:57:52,916
She's more known
for coming up early and strong,

598
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,083
demoralizing her opponents from the start.

599
00:57:55,166 --> 00:57:57,416
So, I think she should accept the draw.

600
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:00,291
The world will see it
as a solid achievement.

601
00:58:01,041 --> 00:58:02,541
A draw, however, is not a win.

602
00:58:03,416 --> 00:58:06,125
The one thing
we know about Elizabeth Harmon

603
00:58:06,208 --> 00:58:07,500
is that she loves to win.

604
00:58:44,708 --> 00:58:46,791
That was
the point of the sequence,

605
00:58:46,875 --> 00:58:49,250
beginning with the bishop,
cutting down the scope of the rook

606
00:58:49,333 --> 00:58:51,166
<i>by forcing it to a less threatening rank.</i>

607
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:53,333
<i>The question is…</i>

608
00:58:53,958 --> 00:58:55,041
<i>What will she do now?</i>

609
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:44,875
It's your game.

610
00:59:52,208 --> 00:59:53,041
Take it.

611
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,416
She won!

612
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,583
Thank you.

613
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,416
Good for you, cracker.

614
01:01:12,541 --> 01:01:13,375
Good for you.

615
01:01:15,708 --> 01:01:16,541
Mm.

616
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,958
<i>The president has invited you</i>
<i>to the White House.</i>

617
01:01:54,041 --> 01:01:56,166
There'll be a chess board
set up in the Oval Office,

618
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:58,708
and, of course,
a photo-op of you kicking his ass.

619
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:01,625
Texas being more of a checkers state.

620
01:02:05,541 --> 01:02:09,250
And there's a dinner tonight
at the Russian Chess Club in Georgetown.

621
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:12,291
A lot of prominent dissidents belong, so…

622
01:02:12,958 --> 01:02:14,958
We've prepared a list of talking points.

623
01:02:19,416 --> 01:02:20,250
It's a big deal.

624
01:02:21,666 --> 01:02:23,666
Beating the Soviets at their own game.

625
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:27,791
Could you stop the car, please?

626
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:31,041
I'd like to walk.

627
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:32,875
To the airport?

628
01:02:34,791 --> 01:02:36,500
You're gonna miss the fli...

629
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,250
Harmon?

630
01:03:43,208 --> 01:03:44,333
Liza Harmon?

631
01:03:44,916 --> 01:03:45,750
<i>Da.</i>

632
01:03:48,541 --> 01:03:49,375
Harmon!

633
01:04:04,291 --> 01:04:05,208
Liza!

634
01:04:42,041 --> 01:04:44,125
Let's play.
