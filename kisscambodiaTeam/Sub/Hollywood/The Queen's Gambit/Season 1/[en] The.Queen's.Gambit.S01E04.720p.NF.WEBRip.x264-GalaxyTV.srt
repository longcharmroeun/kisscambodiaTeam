1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,291
<i>I love.</i>

2
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:14,625
He loves.

3
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,708
You love.

4
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,333
We love.

5
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:30,125
One more time, Beth.

6
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:33,666
Good.

7
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:35,583
One more time.

8
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:06,791
Hey. What's your name again?

9
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,375
It's Beth, nimrod.

10
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:11,416
Right. Well, Beth Nimrod,
what are you doing?

11
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:13,541
You know, like, right now.

12
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:20,791
<i>You're the chess player.</i>

13
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,041
- <i>That's right.</i>
<i>- Hm.</i>

14
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,041
US Women's Champion?

15
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:29,875
US Open Co-Champion.

16
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:31,708
Must be a trip.

17
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,333
I guess.

18
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:40,125
- Do you play?
- No, too cerebral.

19
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:44,125
- Played a lot of Monopoly, though.
- Never played that game.

20
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:46,708
Mm, don't.
It makes you a slave to capitalism.

21
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:50,083
I-I still dream
about making money, though.

22
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:55,458
So, why are you taking Russian classes
if you're a slave to capitalism?

23
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:56,416
Mmm.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,125
I wanna read Dostoevsky in the original.

25
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,083
"You really like the shape of me"?

26
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:14,333
I'm stoned. I shouldn't
be speaking a foreign language.

27
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,791
And I should probably call home.

28
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:18,916
Um…

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,166
Phone's in the bedroom,
through the kitchen.

30
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:24,666
Thanks.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,875
Hello?

32
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:51,583
<i>Hey, I just wanted to let you know</i>
<i>that I'm with some friends.</i>

33
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,500
<i>- From my Russian class.</i>
- Oh.

34
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,541
Go on to bed. I've got a key.

35
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,416
Did you say
you're partying with college students?

36
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:01,625
Yep.

37
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:04,458
Okay.

38
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,875
Just be careful what you smoke, honey.

39
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:09,458
Okay.

40
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,625
See you in the morning?

41
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,958
<i>Is there anyone you've met</i>
<i>that you'd like to…</i>

42
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,708
<i>…Trade rooks with?</i>

43
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:57,500
Jesus.

44
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,208
What's that burning purple thing there?

45
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:04,750
You tell me.

46
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,208
- How much longer?
- Um…

47
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,375
- I'm close.
- Okay.

48
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,125
I'm sorry, I'm just really stoned.

49
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:35,625
Yeah, me too.

50
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,000
"Everybody went to Cincinnati
to see a movie."

51
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,833
"Stay as long as you like."

52
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,666
<i> You might have called.</i>

53
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,916
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>Didn't wanna wake you up.</i>

54
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:59,375
- <i> I wouldn't have minded.</i>
- Anyways, I'm all right.

55
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,083
I'm going to Cincinnati…

56
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,000
<i>To see a movie.</i>

57
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,708
<i>So, I won't be home tonight, either.</i>

58
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:12,958
I'll be home after school Monday.

59
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,125
Are you with a boy?

60
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,375
<i>I was last night.</i>

61
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:24,958
Oh, Beth.

62
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,250
I'm all right. I…

63
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:29,541
Had a good time.

64
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,041
Well, chess isn't the only thing in life.

65
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,708
- It's just…
- I won't get pregnant.

66
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,625
Famous last words.

67
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,500
<i>Elizabeth Harmon.</i>

68
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,458
Congrats.

69
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm so proud of you.

70
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,166
All right, open it.

71
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,125
It's a Bulova.

72
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,083
It's perfect.

73
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,291
Thank you.

74
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:11,750
So…

75
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,958
I suppose you'll be going
to a grad night party or two.

76
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,083
No.

77
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,833
We have Mexico City in two weeks.

78
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,000
And then the US Championship.

79
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:23,875
And then Remy-Vallon.

80
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,833
In Paris.

81
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,416
Paris?

82
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,625
They invited me.

83
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:34,916
Paris.

84
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,583
My God!

85
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,708
Things are beginning to happen.

86
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,958
- Another <i>cerveza, por favor.</i>
- Yes.

87
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:04,208
- What are you reading about?
- Pawn structure analysis.

88
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,333
Sounds exciting.

89
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,250
It is.

90
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,458
Beth?

91
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:12,375
Mm-hm?

92
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,958
I have a confession to make.

93
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,708
Do you know what a pen pal is?

94
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,291
Someone you exchange letters with.

95
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,250
Yes, exactly.

96
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,500
- Your beer, Ms. Wheatley.
- Thank you.

97
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,000
Well…

98
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:37,000
When I was in high school,
my Spanish class was given a list

99
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,916
of boys in Mexico
who were studying English.

100
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,541
I picked one,
and I sent him a letter about myself.

101
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:49,833
We corresponded for a rather long time,
even when I was married to Allston.

102
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,291
We exchanged photographs.

103
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,041
His name is Manuel.

104
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,291
He's meeting us at the airport.

105
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:05,708
Have you ever met him before?

106
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,291
Never.

107
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,708
I have to say, I am really quite thrilled.

108
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,041
Is he the reason you wanted to come
to Mexico early?

109
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:19,916
I suppose so.

110
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,125
Every single famous person
in Latin-American history,

111
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:54,125
art or politics,
has sometime come to Mexico City.

112
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,750
Mm. I can see why.

113
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,250
- It's lovely.
- Oh, yeah.

114
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,875
I like to say that I was born in Mexico…

115
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,666
But I am from Mexico City.

116
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:00,541
Beth?

117
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,083
You just get here?

118
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:03,916
A few days ago.

119
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:08,833
- I thought you were done with tournaments.
- I am. Mike's a glutton for punishment.

120
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,666
- Yeah.
- Your mom has a new friend.

121
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:20,166
She came in at three o'clock this morning,
2:30 the day before.

122
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,416
He's got a green Dodge
that always seems to be at her disposal.

123
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,458
And they've had lunch and dinner
every day this week.

124
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,583
I'm pretty sure they're fucking.

125
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,333
I thought, at first, it was the altitude.

126
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,083
7,350 feet.

127
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:39,458
Good lord, it's enough
to make a person positively giddy.

128
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,000
Now, I think it's the culture.

129
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,750
There's no hint
of a Protestant ethic in Mexico.

130
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,041
They're all Latin Catholics,

131
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,083
and they all live in the here and now.

132
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,791
You really need
to stop reading Alan Watts.

133
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:53,750
It's annoying.

134
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,625
I think I'll have just one margarita
before I go out.

135
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,000
Will you call for one, honey?

136
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:09,916
- <i>Recepción.</i>
- Yes, could we get a margarita and a Coke?

137
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,208
- <i>Room number?</i>
- 713.

138
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,750
<i>- Coming soon.</i>
- Yes, thank you.

139
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,875
You know you could come along
to the<i> folklórico.</i>

140
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,750
I understand the costumes alone
are worth the price of admission.

141
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:23,125
- It's such a beautiful day.
- It's been raining the last two days.

142
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,208
Has it?

143
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:26,708
I hadn't noticed.

144
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:32,458
The tournament starts tomorrow.
I need to work on these endgames.

145
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:35,333
You know, perhaps, Beth,
you have to work on yourself.

146
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,083
Chess is not all there is.

147
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,875
It's what I know.

148
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:43,041
My experience has taught me what
you know isn't always what's important.

149
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,750
And what's important?

150
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,333
Living and growing.

151
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,208
Living your life.

152
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:54,625
- With a sleazy Mexican salesman.
- Treating yourself. Adventure.

153
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:59,041
You haven't visited Bellas Artes,
or even been to Chapultepec Park.

154
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,750
The zoo there is delightful.

155
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,041
You've taken
all of your meals in this room,

156
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,666
you've had your nose
buried in a chess book.

157
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,458
Shouldn't you just relax
the day before the tournament?

158
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,500
Think about something other than chess?

159
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:11,416
Mother.

160
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:15,375
Tomorrow, at ten o'clock,
I play black against Octavio Marenco.

161
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,208
That means he gets to move first.

162
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,708
Yes. I know what playing black means.

163
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,666
He's 34 and an International Grandmaster.

164
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,041
If I lose, we'll be paying for this trip…

165
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,166
This adventure…

166
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,000
Out of capital.

167
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:33,125
If I win, I'll be playing someone even
better than Marenco in the afternoon.

168
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,625
I need to study my endgame.

169
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:39,291
You're what they call
an intuitive player, are you not?

170
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,208
Yes, I have been called that before.

171
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,416
Sometimes, the moves come to me.

172
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,083
I've noticed the moves
they applaud the loudest

173
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,041
are the ones you make rather quickly.

174
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,083
And there's a certain look on your face.

175
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,375
Intuition can't be found in books.

176
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,791
I think you just don't like Manuel.

177
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,666
Manuel is all right.

178
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,458
But he doesn't come by to see me.

179
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,041
That's irrelevant.

180
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,250
You need to relax.

181
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,208
There's no player in the world
as gifted as you are.

182
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,666
I haven't the remotest idea
what faculties a person needs

183
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,250
in order to play chess well,

184
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:26,416
but I am convinced
that relaxation can only improve them.

185
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,833
- <i>Una cerveza Corona, por favor.</i>
<i>- Sí.</i>

186
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,708
<i>People like you have a hard time.</i>

187
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,291
Two sides of the same coin.

188
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:05,916
You've got your gift…

189
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,625
…and you've got what it costs.

190
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,166
<i>Hard to say for you what that will be.</i>

191
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,791
<i>You'll have your
time in the sun, but for how long?</i>

192
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,666
You've got so much anger in you.

193
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,833
<i>You'll have to be careful.</i>

194
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,208
<i>Cerveza?</i>

195
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,250
Let's play.

196
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,166
Shit.

197
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,500
You can turn on the light. I'm now awake.

198
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,458
I'm sorry.

199
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,041
I seem to have caught a virus.

200
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,958
I don't know if I'll be able
to watch your match in the morning.

201
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,791
It's all right.

202
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,208
You'll tell me all about it?

203
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,291
Sure.

204
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,125
Every move?

205
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,250
Of course.

206
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,083
Hi, boys.

207
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,000
- Hey.
- Hey.

208
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,583
Lovely night for a swim.

209
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,500
<i>This is Juan Alberto Diaz</i>

210
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:02,250
<i>coming to you live from the Mexico City
Invitational Chess Tournament</i>

211
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,666
<i>at the Palacio Azteca where</i>

212
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:10,708
<i>the big story
has been the seventeen-year-old</i>

213
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:14,375
<i>from Lexington, Kentucky,
Elizabeth Harmon.</i>

214
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,708
<i>Neither of us spoke the other's language.</i>

215
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,666
<i>He opened with a pawn to king four.</i>

216
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,208
<i>I played pawn to queen's bishop four.</i>

217
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:30,333
In 31 moves,
I had his king in a mating net.

218
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,541
You're a wonder.

219
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,666
<i>Undefeated, this morning she played</i>

220
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,416
<i>the Queen's Gambit Declined</i>

221
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,958
<i>against the Austrian, Diedrich.</i>

222
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,125
<i>Facing relentless pressure
in the middle of the board,</i>

223
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:32,416
<i>Harmon had him
on his heels from the start.</i>

224
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,916
<i>She did it mostly with pawns,</i>

225
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,916
<i>and crushed his position
as one might crush an egg.</i>

226
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,500
<i>Diedrich played well,</i>

227
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:45,166
<i>made no blunders or anything
that could properly be called a mistake,</i>

228
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,916
<i>but Harmon moved with such deadly accuracy,
such measured control,</i>

229
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,666
<i>that his position was hopeless</i>

230
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,000
<i>by the 23rd move.</i>

231
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,333
<i>Impressive play by this young woman.</i>

232
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:11,333
Borgov retreats his knight,

233
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,375
but he's really attacking
the black knight.

234
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,958
This is a very interesting position.

235
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,291
It is dangerous for both sides.

236
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,750
How is Black going to answer the threat?

237
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,125
Will he defend himself or counter attack?

238
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:32,625
It could go either way.

239
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,458
Mother?

240
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,541
Out here.

241
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,750
Fresh air feels nice, doesn't it?

242
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,375
Aren't you going out?

243
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:04,708
No, Manuel's not coming tonight.

244
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:07,958
He had business in Oaxaca.

245
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:10,708
Oh.

246
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:12,291
How long will he be gone?

247
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,458
At least until we leave.

248
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:18,875
I'm sorry.

249
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,250
I've never been to Oaxaca, but…

250
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,708
I imagine it resembles Denver.

251
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:30,375
We can have dinner together.

252
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:33,375
You can take me
to one of the places you know.

253
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,500
Of course.

254
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,583
It was fun while it lasted.

255
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:53,791
Good afternoon.

256
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,916
I am Georgi Girev.

257
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,333
Beth Harmon.

258
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:00,500
I'm honored.

259
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:23,291
It's been five hours.

260
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,750
Perhaps we should adjourn now.

261
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:30,208
You must seal your move.

262
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:41,666
Miss Harmon must seal her move now.

263
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:57,833
Play will resume tomorrow at ten,
before your regular matches.

264
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:06,500
Miss Harmon.

265
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:08,666
Yes?

266
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:10,625
May I ask you something?

267
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:16,833
In America, I'm told
that one sees films inside the car.

268
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:18,708
Is this true?

269
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:21,250
Drive-ins.

270
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,208
You mean drive-in movies?

271
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:28,541
Yes, Elvis Presley movies.

272
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:31,083
Debbie Reynolds and Elizabeth Taylor…

273
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:32,583
That happens?

274
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,833
It does.

275
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,166
I would dig that.

276
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:19,666
Pawn to rook five.

277
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,375
For you, Beth Harmon…

278
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:37,041
I resign the old-fashioned way.

279
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,333
I've never been to a drive-in, either.

280
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:00,541
I should not have let you do that.

281
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:02,083
With the rook.

282
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:03,500
No.

283
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:08,791
But you won't let
the next one that tries it.

284
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,625
How old were you
when you started playing?

285
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,041
Four.

286
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:17,375
I was district champion at seven.

287
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:21,625
I will be world champion one day.

288
00:30:21,708 --> 00:30:22,541
When?

289
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:24,708
In three years.

290
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:26,875
You'll be 16 in three years.

291
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,583
If you win…

292
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:32,833
What will you do next?

293
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,291
I-I don't understand.

294
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:38,958
If you're world champion at 16…

295
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:42,541
What will you do
with the rest of your life?

296
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:52,041
I don't understand.

297
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,208
You're the best I've ever played.

298
00:31:08,916 --> 00:31:10,333
Until you play Borgov.

299
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:06,541
Beth.

300
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,708
Look what I found.

301
00:32:35,541 --> 00:32:38,916
Everyone, this is Elizabeth Harmon,
the US Champion.

302
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,708
Co-Champion.

303
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:43,208
I'm sorry I missed your match,

304
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:45,250
but the bath was so lovely.

305
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,291
I soaked the entire afternoon.

306
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,125
I'm glad.

307
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:51,875
- You look better.
- I feel better.

308
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,166
- Are you hungry?
- Starving.

309
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,000
Thank you.
You play beautiful, señora.

310
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:57,041
Thank you.

311
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:00,125
So much for your stage fright.

312
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:02,250
I play fine as long as it's for fun.

313
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:04,041
Where shall we go?

314
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,625
Any one of the new places
you've been to?

315
00:33:06,708 --> 00:33:07,541
Mm-hm.

316
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,125
Let's eat in the room.

317
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:36,250
You wanna grab it? Here.

318
00:33:53,375 --> 00:33:56,541
In Moscow, she'll be
jet-lagged. We can destroy her then.

319
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:58,125
She's getting better.

320
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:01,083
Have to deal with her here or in Paris

321
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:03,125
before she gets too strong.

322
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,041
There's talk she's a drunk.

323
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,416
Her game is almost all attack.

324
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,000
So she doesn't always watch her back.

325
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:12,458
When she blunders, she gets angry,

326
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:13,458
and can be dangerous.

327
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:16,875
- Like all women.
- She's an orphan. A survivor.

328
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:21,500
She's like us...
Losing is not an option for her.

329
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:25,458
Otherwise, what would her life be?

330
00:34:57,541 --> 00:35:00,750
Those two guys,
they're number two and three in the world.

331
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,125
- And those guys?
- KGB.

332
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:08,041
Make sure Borgov doesn't run away.

333
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:14,875
Will you save a seat for my mother?

334
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:16,416
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

335
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:46,250
You may start your opponent's clock.

336
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:56,875
Pawn to king four.

337
00:35:56,958 --> 00:36:00,625
She always plays
the Sicilian to that opening.

338
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:04,500
It's the most common opening
for White in the game of chess,

339
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:09,916
and Borgov has been called
the "Master of the Sicilian."

340
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:14,166
<i>Harmon moves pawn to queen bishop four,</i>

341
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:18,458
<i>hoping to play him on ground
that's fresh for both of them,</i>

342
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:21,916
<i>that won't give him
the advantage of his superior knowledge.</i>

343
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:29,541
<i>And now Borgov has brought out
his king's knight to bishop three,</i>

344
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,458
…and Harmon,

345
00:36:31,541 --> 00:36:33,916
of course,
brings hers to queen bishop three,

346
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,708
attacking the center.

347
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:44,208
But Borgov moves his bishop
to knight five,

348
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:48,208
signaling he's going to play
the Closed Sicilian,

349
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:49,583
not the Open.

350
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,416
Please do not disturb the players.

351
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,250
The Rossolimo. A rare opening…

352
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:14,500
Harmon pushes her pawn

353
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:17,625
to rook three,
attacking Borgov's bishop.

354
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:27,125
Borgov castles.

355
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:30,083
Harmon must now decide

356
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:33,583
to open the game or keep it closed.

357
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:35,625
<i>White has the advantage.</i>

358
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:38,666
Since it always has the first move,
it always has the advantage.

359
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,125
I read that when computers
learn to play chess,

360
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:42,958
and play against other computers,

361
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:45,750
White will always win
because of the first move.

362
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:48,166
Like tic-tac-toe.

363
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,625
Borgov's not a machine.

364
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:52,750
That you know of.

365
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:47,291
<i>I didn't expect it.</i>

366
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,708
No one really plays it.

367
00:38:50,666 --> 00:38:51,708
It threw me off.

368
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:54,541
Just like he knew it would.

369
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:59,208
From that point on, the whole game
was like a foregone conclusion. I…

370
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:03,416
I couldn't fight this feeling
that I'd already lost.

371
00:39:04,083 --> 00:39:06,833
Like in the books,

372
00:39:06,916 --> 00:39:09,000
where you know the outcome,
but you play it out

373
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:11,083
just to see how it would happen, and…

374
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:16,000
I mean, every move he made was so…

375
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:19,000
Obvious, so…

376
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:22,291
Unimaginative, so bureaucratic.

377
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:26,541
<i>And the whole time, I'd look at his face,</i>

378
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:28,875
<i>and there was no doubt.</i>

379
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,250
<i>No weakness.</i>

380
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:35,083
I'm so glad you didn't see it.

381
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:44,791
Mother?

382
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:27,625
I'm sorry.

383
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:29,916
What was it?

384
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,125
Hepatitis, possibly.

385
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:32,791
We will know tomorrow.

386
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:36,375
Could you give me a tranquilizer?

387
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:39,541
- Yes. I have a sedative.
- I don't want a sedative.

388
00:40:40,416 --> 00:40:42,208
Could I have a prescription for Librium?

389
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:46,541
You don't need a prescription
to buy Librium in Mexico.

390
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:48,958
I suggest meprobamate.

391
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:51,750
There's a <i>farmacia </i>here in the hotel.

392
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:55,416
Again, I'm very sorry for your loss.

393
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:03,666
Allow us to help you
with any arrangements.

394
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:07,041
Signing papers, dealing with authorities.

395
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:10,750
And, of course,
the bill will be taken care of.

396
00:41:11,541 --> 00:41:14,333
- Thank you.
- Including the liquor bill,

397
00:41:14,416 --> 00:41:16,166
which was significant.

398
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,750
Though, I'm sure none
of the many margaritas she consumed

399
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:23,291
was the culprit
in your mother's untimely passing.

400
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,791
She did mention something
about the quality of the tequila.

401
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:33,500
Again…

402
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:35,666
Whatever we can do to help.

403
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:47,875
I need to find him.

404
00:42:00,916 --> 00:42:01,750
Hello?

405
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,458
<i>I have your call.</i>

406
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:05,125
<i>From Denver.</i>

407
00:42:05,916 --> 00:42:06,750
Thank you.

408
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:11,083
<i>This is Allston Wheatley.</i>

409
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:14,000
It's Beth, Mr. Wheatley.

410
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:15,708
Beth?

411
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:17,250
<i>Your daughter.</i>

412
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:20,791
<i>- Elizabeth Harmon.</i>
- And you're in Mexico?

413
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:22,333
It's about Mrs. Wheatley.

414
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,958
<i>How is Alma? Is she there with you?</i>

415
00:42:26,416 --> 00:42:27,250
She's dead.

416
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,125
<i>She died this morning.</i>

417
00:42:32,791 --> 00:42:34,541
<i>- Mr. Wheatley...</i>
- Can't you handle this?

418
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:36,416
I-I can't be going off to Mexico.

419
00:42:39,708 --> 00:42:43,416
There's an autopsy in the morning,
and I have to buy new plane tickets…

420
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:47,375
I mean, I have to get
a new ticket for myself.

421
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:55,958
- I don't know where to bury her.
- Call Durgin Brothers in Lexington.

422
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:58,708
There's a family plot
in her maiden name, Benson.

423
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:01,041
What about the house?

424
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,375
Look, I don't want any part of this.

425
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:04,791
I got problems enough in Denver.

426
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:08,375
Get her up to Kentucky and bury her,
and the house is yours. Just…

427
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:11,458
<i>Make the mortgage payments.</i>

428
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:13,208
<i>You need money?</i>

429
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,583
I don't know.
I don't know how much it'll cost.

430
00:43:16,666 --> 00:43:19,708
<i>I heard you're doing all right.
The child-prodigy thing.</i>

431
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:21,166
<i>Can't you charge it or something?</i>

432
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:24,708
I'll ask the hotel.

433
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:27,250
<i>Good, you do that.
I'm strapped for cash right now,</i>

434
00:43:27,333 --> 00:43:30,708
but call Second National Bank
and ask for Mr. Erlich.

435
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:33,083
That's E-R-L-I-C-H.

436
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:36,041
Say you can have the house.
He knows how to reach me.

437
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:37,916
Don't you want to know how she died?

438
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,833
What was it?

439
00:43:40,916 --> 00:43:42,083
Hepatitis.

440
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:45,250
I think. We'll know tomorrow.

441
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,125
Yeah.

442
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:48,875
She was sick a lot.

443
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:47,083
<i>Más.</i>
