1
00:00:06,416 --> 00:00:08,166
Dark's nothing to be afraid of.

2
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:12,125
In fact, I'd go as far as saying
there's nothing to be afraid of.

3
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,208
Anywhere.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,375
The strongest person is the person
who isn't scared to be alone.

5
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:23,416
It's other people you got to worry about.

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,750
Other people. They'll tell you what to do,
how to feel…

7
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,041
Before you know it…

8
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:33,708
…you're pouring your life out
in search of something

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,166
other people told you to go look for.

10
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,375
Someday, you're gonna be all alone,

11
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,041
so you need to figure out
how to take care of yourself.

12
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:35,666
Hello.

13
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,083
<i>Beth Harmon?</i>

14
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,958
Yes.

15
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:43,958
Uh, this is Harry Beltik.
Uh, from the Kentucky State Tournament.

16
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,458
No, I remember.

17
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,541
I hear you dropped one to Borgov.

18
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,750
<i>I wanted to give condolences.</i>

19
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,583
Thanks.

20
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,375
<i>What were you playing, white?</i>

21
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,583
- Black.
<i>- Oh, it's-it's better that way.</i>

22
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,708
I mean, if you're gonna lose.

23
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,125
<i>Suppose so.</i>

24
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,375
What did you play?

25
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,375
Closed Sicilian.

26
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,500
Rossolimo? Really?

27
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,791
I let him do it to me.

28
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:12,833
<i>That's a mistake.</i>

29
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:17,541
Uh, look, I'm in Lexington for the summer,
and I thought maybe…

30
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,375
Maybe what?

31
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,916
Would you like some training?

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,083
<i>I-I know…
I know you're better than me.</i>

33
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:28,375
<i>But if you're gonna play the Soviets,
you need help.</i>

34
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:29,916
Where are you?

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,500
I'm on my way to the Phoenix Hotel.

36
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,541
<i>I'm moving to an apartment on Thursday.
I could come by then.</i>

37
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,250
Why don't you come over right now?

38
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,750
Excuse me, miss.

39
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:24,458
What happened to that gawky kid
who kicked my ass five years ago?

40
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,375
Apparently, she grew up.

41
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,583
A.I. Deinkopf.

42
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,166
<i>Middlegame Strategy.</i>

43
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,250
I've read that one.

44
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,500
J.R. Capablanca, <i>My Chess Career.</i>

45
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,583
That one, too.

46
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:57,333
Fornaut, <i>Alekhine's Games 1938 to 1945.</i>

47
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,250
Yes.

48
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,833
Meyer, <i>Rook and Pawn Endings.</i>

49
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,916
I know, you've read it.

50
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,833
No.

51
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,625
But I have my own copy upstairs.

52
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,500
Well, some of these
are gonna be new to you.

53
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,208
Capablanca played on intuition.

54
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,750
And his natural gifts,
which obviously were considerable.

55
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,458
Unlike Bogoljubov and Grünfeld,
who memorized everything.

56
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,583
Yeah, I know how you feel about them.

57
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,375
I read your piece in <i>Chess Review.</i>

58
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,583
Nice cover photo, by the way.

59
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,125
I see players at tournaments
after their games have finished,

60
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,958
sitting there studying opening variation

61
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:42,125
or middle-game strategy, endgame theory.

62
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,375
- Like it would have made a difference.
- You don't ever study?

63
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,000
I analyze games.

64
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,041
What actually happened,
not what could have happened.

65
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,041
- And I play it by ear.
- Like Capablanca.

66
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,500
- He would have beaten Borgov.
- Mmm, not every game.

67
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,208
Mmm, every game that counted.

68
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,791
- You think I'm a prima donna, don't you?
- It's chess.

69
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:05,958
We're all prima donnas.

70
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:10,708
So, I've replayed your match
with Benny Watts a dozen times now.

71
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,333
Why?

72
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,833
- That's ancient history.
- Well, it's not that ancient.

73
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,291
- I'm a different player now.
- In some ways.

74
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,041
You're stubborn, so you get mad.

75
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,375
When that happens,
you can only see what's in front of you.

76
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,000
Anger clears my head.

77
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,708
Anger is a potent spice.

78
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,416
A pinch wakes you up,
too much dulls your senses.

79
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,333
Where'd you get that from,
a fortune cookie?

80
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,541
Mrs. Grecco, my second grade teacher.

81
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,916
- Ah.
- Mm.

82
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,458
But the point is still valid.
You've got to stay open.

83
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:46,291
If you get locked into one idea,
like this king knight pawn, say,

84
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,208
it's death.

85
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:49,500
Look.

86
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:58,166
- Now, the knight pawn is pinned.
- So?

87
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,000
So you got to move the king now,
or you get stuck later.

88
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,083
I can see that, but...

89
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,458
But look at the queen-side pawns,
way over here.

90
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,250
- He could do this.
- Try it.

91
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:33,708
See?

92
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,541
It's a good sequence.

93
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,291
It's from Alekhine.

94
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,625
I'm saying I got it from a book.

95
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,083
I know what you're saying.

96
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,291
Let's eat.

97
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,416
You're not the same person
you were five years ago, either.

98
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,750
- No?
- No.

99
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,291
But I can't figure out what's different.

100
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,583
Um, I've become more profound?

101
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,500
That's not it.

102
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,083
And I, um, got my teeth fixed.

103
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,333
- Yeah, that's it.
- Yeah.

104
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,291
It's the teeth. It was driving me crazy.

105
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,875
I used my tuition money.

106
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,291
My parents are plenty ticked off about it.

107
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,291
It was worth it.

108
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,250
Uh, I should go.

109
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,958
Uh, I'll leave my board here.

110
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:40,416
I'll take this.

111
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,750
I'll be back in the morning
with more books.

112
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,375
Shit.

113
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,375
Oh, God.

114
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,166
<i>No.</i>

115
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,166
<i>You see, I'm a little shy.</i>

116
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,333
<i>What seems to be the trouble?</i>

117
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:44,708
<i>Well, it's difficult to show you</i>
<i>the symptoms at the moment, because…</i>

118
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,083
<i>It comes and it goes.</i>

119
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:51,625
<i>Oh, it comes and goes?</i>

120
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,083
<i>Yes, it's so unfortunate.</i>

121
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,375
<i>It's always the same
whenever I see a doctor.</i>

122
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,291
<i>When… when I come, it goes,</i>

123
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,958
<i>and when I go, it comes.</i>

124
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,375
Okay, tell me, what was your endgame?

125
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,208
You just saw it.

126
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,375
What was your plan?

127
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,333
To beat you?

128
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,833
- I don't know what it was.
- Exactly, you're still just improvising.

129
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,000
I just wiped you out five times.

130
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:24,875
I'm a master,

131
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,958
and I've never played better in my life.

132
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,166
So modest.

133
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,375
But I'm nowhere close
to what you'll face in Paris.

134
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,666
I could beat Borgov
with a little more work.

135
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,291
You can beat Borgov with a lot more work.

136
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,666
Years more work.

137
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,625
Borgov's not some
Kentucky ex-champion like me.

138
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,541
He is a world champion

139
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,958
who could have beaten
both of us when he was ten.

140
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,375
Do you even know his career?

141
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,333
No.

142
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,250
Well…

143
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,208
Read it.

144
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,416
Read the games from Leningrad, 1962.

145
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,541
Look at the way he plays
rook-pawn endings.

146
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,208
Look at the games
with Luchenko and Spassky.

147
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,208
You might learn something.

148
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,916
No, this way.

149
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:21,750
Right.

150
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:29,333
"Look at the games
with Luchenko and Spassky,

151
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,458

152
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,083

153
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,625

00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,208
Summer's coming.

155
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,166
Come on.

156
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,833
I'll turn it down after this. I just…

157
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,041
I love this song.

158
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,041
Are you coming?

159
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:55,291
<i>"In a fight,</i>

<i>their moves,</i>

163
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,458
<i>but it is much worse to forever regret</i>

164
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,541
<i>an opportunity
you allowed to pass you by."</i>

165
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,791
So, it's not always about attacking.

166
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:33,666
Sometimes, it's much better
to take a piece back.

167
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,291
So, this is Smyslov versus Botvinnik.

168
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,666
Now, as you can see,

169
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,875
Botvinnik should have taken
the pawn with the queen.

170
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,875
He must have been very tired,

171
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,583
or someone must have drugged his tea.

172
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,958
Anyway,
I always thought that was interesting.

173
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:57,416
<i> "I'm a good</i>
<i>player, but I play people half my age."</i>

174
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,875
<i>"I don't know
how long I can keep winning."</i>

175
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:10,416
"I can fight against anyone but time."

176
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,375
I'm moving out of the hotel tomorrow.

177
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,333
Into my apartment.

178
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:20,666
Whoa. Uh…

179
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,916
Play pawn to king five.

180
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:25,875
Humor me.

181
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,666
- That's unusual.
- Yeah.

182
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,041
Player named Mikėnas
came up with that one.

183
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,916
- How far away is it?
- Huh?

184
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:37,666
The apartment.

185
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,291
Oh, um, New Circle Road.

186
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,708
- Hm.
- I won't be coming by so much.

187
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,625
It's not so far away.

188
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:50,458
No, but I'll be taking classes,
and I should probably get a part-time job.

189
00:15:56,583 --> 00:16:00,791
You could move in here if you want.
You know, for free.

190
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:06,666
Really?

191
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,916
Yeah.

192
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,041
Really.

193
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:25,958
Um…

194
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,625
- Sorry, I…
- Uh… no. No.

195
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,875
- Um…
- I-I just wasn't ready.

196
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:40,666
I'm ready now.

197
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,125
Now or never.

198
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,416
So, um…

199
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,750
Should I stay here or go back to my room?

200
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,666
Whatever you want.

201
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:37,875
Okay.

202
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:51,250
Good night.

203
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,000
Good night.

204
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,041
Beth?

205
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:14,625
Beth Harmon?

206
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,166
Margaret Neil.

207
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,166
Well, Margaret Johnson now.

208
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:21,750
Fairfield High?

209
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,208
Margaret.
Right. Hi.

210
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:30,166
Mike and I tied the knot
right after graduation.

211
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,375
Congratulations.

212
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,333
Not long after,
we were blessed with this little one.

213
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,083
What's her name?

214
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,416
Jean, after Mike's grandmother.

215
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,125
I read about you.

216
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,708
The chess and the traveling.

217
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,875
It must be exciting.

218
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:47,791
It is.

219
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,583
Being around all those boys
is a real thrill.

220
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,375
You wanted to know
what the boys were like,

221
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,708
if I dated any of them.

222
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:03,375
That time I came over to your house
with the Apple Pis.

223
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,583
Oh! Gosh!

224
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,416
That seems, uh…

225
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,416
like a million years ago, doesn't it?

226
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,583
I should probably get my errands done,
before this one gets…

227
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,708
Really fussy,
and the window of opportunity,

228
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,666
as we like to say, slams shut.

229
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,166
It was nice to see you.

230
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,125
You, too.

231
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,916
<i>I think there's more to life than chess.</i>

232
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,458
Yeah, one of my heroes is Philidor.

233
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,041
This French musician,
used to play chess blindfolded

234
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,500
in Paris and London.

235
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,416
Diderot wrote him a letter.

236
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,625
Now, you know Diderot?

237
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,375
French Revolution?

238
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,666
Yeah, it's close enough.

239
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:49,750
So, uh, Philidor was doing
blindfold exhibitions

240
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,458
and burning out his brain,

241
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:55,041
or whatever it was they thought you did
in the 18th century. Anyway…

242
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:58,541
Diderot wrote to him
and said something like,

243
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:03,416
"It's foolish to run the risk
of going mad for vanity's sake."

244
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,250
Now, I think about that sometimes,

245
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,041
when I'm analyzing my ass off
over a chess board.

246
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,708
I, um… I saw your picture
on the cover of <i>Chess Review,</i>

247
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,250
and those pictures
Townes took in Las Vegas,

248
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,333
for the Lexington paper.

249
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,333
They were beautiful.

250
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,666
- I thought maybe the two of you were...
- No, we weren't.

251
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:35,791
Truth is…

252
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,750
I was waiting for you to come back.

253
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,500
You're why I got my teeth fixed.

254
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,958
Didn't Koltanowski
use to play blindfolded all the time?

255
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:48,583
And he wasn't crazy.

256
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,375
No, no, no, he's-he's not. It was, um…

257
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,666
It was Morphy who went crazy,
and Steinitz.

258
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,166
Morphy thought
people were trying to steal his shoes.

259
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,666
Well, maybe he thought
shoes were bishops.

260
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,541
Yeah, maybe.

261
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,041
Beth?

262
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:20,541
Let's play chess.

263
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,208
Okay.

264
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,875
Two packs of Chesterfields, please.

265
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,041
This, too.

266
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,375
Sure you wouldn't rather just steal it?

267
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,000
You gonna be there?

268
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:56,666
That tournament?

269
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:00,458
Yes.

270
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:02,500
Good luck.

271
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:06,541
Keep it.

272
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,333
For the first time.

273
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,625
Whoa, that doesn't look right.
Your knight is hanging.

274
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:16,541
Mm-mm.

275
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:19,541
You're missing it.
It's a much stronger move than it looks.

276
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:22,500
Okay, watch.

277
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,750
The knight takes,

278
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,666
and the pawn moves up.

279
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:30,708
If he didn't move it up,
the bishop would be locked in.

280
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:33,250
When he does…

281
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,000
…the other pawn falls.

282
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:40,458
- What about the other bishop here?
- For Christ's sakes.

283
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,583
It's check once the pawn moves,
and the knight trades.

284
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:44,333
Can't you see that?

285
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:49,000
- No, I can't. I can't find it that fast.
- Well, wish you could.

286
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:54,208
You're too sharp for me.

287
00:23:58,583 --> 00:23:59,416
Hey.

288
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,250
Breakfast is almost ready.

289
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:11,208
I have taught you everything I know.

290
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,916
Which, admittedly, is not a lot.

291
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,333
I've got to start studying.

292
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:22,291
I'm supposed to be an electrical engineer,
not a chess bum.

293
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:26,333
Where are you gonna go?

294
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,125
I'm moving to that apartment.

295
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,958
It's closer to the university.

296
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,791
- I'm gonna leave you...
- You're wrong, you know.

297
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:43,916
You've taught me a lot.

298
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:46,958
I'm really glad you called.

299
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:50,250
I'm glad I could be here with you,
you know?

300
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:52,791
After you lost your mom.

301
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:54,833
It's more than that.

302
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:59,291
You've really helped me.

303
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:02,291
I guess you've helped me, too.

304
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:05,375
You've helped me realize something.

305
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:07,250
What?

306
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:09,916
That I don't love chess.

307
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:12,125
No, it's okay.

308
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:15,875
I just don't love it
as much as I once did.

309
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:20,875
I'm not obsessed with it
the way one has to be to win it all.

310
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,208
The way you are.

311
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:28,041
I'm gonna leave you…

312
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,083
This.

313
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:34,416
You have a lot in common.

314
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:36,708
Really?

315
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:40,166
Morphy was a lawyer or something,
in New Orleans.

316
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,583
You look at his games,

317
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,416
the way he played.

318
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:48,333
He sacrificed knights and bishops
like he had a dozen instead of two,

319
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:52,500
and then he'd move in on the king so fast,
his opponents would just freeze up.

320
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:57,625
It's too bad Morphy and Capablanca
hadn't been alive at the same time.

321
00:25:57,708 --> 00:25:58,958
They could've played each other.

322
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:02,500
Yeah, it's too bad Morphy
fell into a muttering paranoia and died.

323
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,208
He would stay up all night,
in Paris, before his games,

324
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:14,041
drinking in cafes,
and talking with strangers.

325
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:18,958
And then he'd play
the next day like a shark.

326
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:23,083
Well-mannered, well-dressed,
moving the pieces

327
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:26,833
with these small, ladylike hands.

328
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:30,500
Crushing one European master
after another.

329
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,250
You know what they called him?

330
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:38,708
"The pride and the sorrow of chess."

331
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:42,416
And then he retired at 22.

332
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:46,583
- And you think that's gonna be me?
- I think that is you.

333
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:49,875
I think maybe…

334
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,833
It's always been you.

335
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:09,250
Be careful, Beth.

336
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,916
Why, hello, Beth.

337
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:49,208
Why, hello, Benny.

338
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:54,250
I read about your game with Borgov.
That must have felt terrible.

339
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:56,625
- I felt like a fool.
- I know that feeling.

340
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:58,000
Helpless.

341
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:00,458
It all goes, and you just…

342
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,250
Push wood.

343
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:07,250
Who have you got up first?

344
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:09,708
Manfredi.

345
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:15,875
That shouldn't take too long.

346
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:20,333
Highest-rated players
in the whole fucking country,

347
00:29:20,416 --> 00:29:23,041
and yet here we are
at some second-rate university,

348
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:27,333
playing on cheap plastic boards
with cheap plastic pieces.

349
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:31,250
If this were
a golf or tennis tournament,

350
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:33,666
we'd be surrounded by reporters,
as opposed to…

351
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:36,333
…whoever these people are.

352
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:39,666
You should see where
they play in the Soviet Union.

353
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,333
I'm planning on it.

354
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:43,958
You have to get past me first.

355
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:45,541
I'm planning on that, too.

356
00:31:40,958 --> 00:31:44,375
Now, most players, they lack
the courage in their convictions.

357
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:48,541
The key is to not be tentative.
You have to play with absolute confidence.

358
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:49,791
I can tell, on the first move,

359
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:53,875
whether someone's got that or they don't,
just from how they move that first piece.

360
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:56,333
What advice would you give
to any young players

361
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,041
who wanna follow in your footsteps?

362
00:31:58,958 --> 00:31:59,791
Um…

363
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,000
I'd tell them to read my book.

364
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:04,333
Obviously. Um…

365
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,708
Yeah, play through all the games.
You know, I'd tell them to get in shape.

366
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:12,541
Most people think about chess players,
they think about people who look like you.

367
00:32:12,958 --> 00:32:14,041
Harmon!

368
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:15,458
Wait up.

369
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:20,666
Found you a reporter, I see.

370
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,208
Funny. Ha.

371
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:27,041
What did you do to that poor guy
you played in the third round?

372
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,958
He looked like he wanted to kill himself.

373
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:31,791
Uh, which poor guy are you talking about?

374
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:33,750
Touché.

375
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:39,666
Hey, uh, some of us have been, uh,
heading down to the student union,

376
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,625
having a couple beers,
playing some speed chess.

377
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:42,666
You should join us.

378
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,666
No, thanks. I have to study.

379
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:48,041
Thought I'd go back to the dorms,
read your book.

380
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:50,250
You know, get in shape.

381
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:54,541
You do realize
that we have the whole day off tomorrow?

382
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:57,791
Can I ask you a question?

383
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:58,708
Ooh.

384
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,958
Depends on whether or not
the answer will give you an edge.

385
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:02,875
Seriously?

386
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:04,916
Are you that nervous?

387
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,083
- Was that the question?
- No! What's with the knife?

388
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:10,041
What do you mean?

389
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:13,250
I mean, why do you carry it around?

390
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:15,750
This is for protection.

391
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:20,791
- From what?
- Whatever.

392
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:24,041
Study hard.

393
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:41,708
Beth!

394
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:53,333
Beth Harmon,
this is Danny Weiss and Dave Friedman.

395
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:55,333
Nice to meet you.

396
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:57,791
Actually, we met.
You beat me the other day.

397
00:34:58,875 --> 00:35:00,916
Me, too. Rather badly, in fact.

398
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,333
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

399
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:06,250
After I finished weeping in my room,
I replayed the game.

400
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:09,125
Learned a lot from it, so thank you.

401
00:35:09,666 --> 00:35:12,291
- You're welcome.
- Beth, take a look at this.

402
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:13,291
It's White's move.

403
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:15,375
What would you do?

404
00:35:18,458 --> 00:35:20,166
Typical mid-game Ruy Lopez.

405
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,500
Well, yeah, we know that,
but what's the move?

406
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26,916
- You see?
- Maybe you're right.

407
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,250
No, I know I'm right,
and Beth sees things the same way I do.

408
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:32,791
The pawn move is too weak, right?

409
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:36,125
The pawn move
only works if he plays his bishop.

410
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:37,041
Exactly.

411
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:39,083
- Bye, boys.
- Whoa, hold on.

412
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:41,208
How about some speed chess?

413
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:45,541
Or we could play some skittles, or blitz,

414
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:46,750
or bughouse?

415
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:51,125
No, I'm just gonna get some coffee,
and then I'm gonna go back and study.

416
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:53,791
Well, Weiss will get you some coffee,
won't you, Weiss?

417
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:58,458
Uh… yeah.

418
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,125
Sugar, cream?

419
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:04,500
Yes.

420
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:07,250
- Thank you.
- Uh, get me an apple juice.

421
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,708
But not one of those, uh,
crappy plastic cups.

422
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:12,083
Get me a-a milk glass.

423
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:13,166
Yeah, sure.

424
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,125
Please, sit.

425
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:21,416
Fine.

426
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:23,583
One game.

427
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:25,083
- Got it?
- All right.

428
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:31,291
Okay.

429
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:33,791
Shall we say…

430
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:36,041
Five bucks a game?

431
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:40,958
- I haven't even had my coffee.
- Well, look, here it comes right now.

432
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:45,333
- There you go.
- Thank you.

433
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:52,583
All right, you take a sip of that coffee,
and I'll punch your clock.

434
00:36:58,208 --> 00:36:59,500
Go ahead.

435
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:50,375
Again?

436
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,416
Again?

437
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:35,916
Again?

438
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:03,916
Again?

439
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:46,291
- I need to see proof.
- Calling me a liar?

440
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:11,583
It's gonna be you or me.

441
00:40:19,916 --> 00:40:23,541
- Are you trying to psych me out?
- No, I don't need to do that to beat you.

442
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:31,708
Listen, I'm sorry about yesterday, okay?
I wasn't trying to hustle you.

443
00:40:31,791 --> 00:40:33,916
- Weren't you?
- Come on, Beth.

444
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,500
You're the best player here.

445
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:39,166
And I've been watching your games. You…

446
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:41,125
You attack like Alekhine.

447
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:44,333
You held me off well enough yesterday.

448
00:40:44,916 --> 00:40:46,666
But that doesn't count.
That's speed chess.

449
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:49,458
I'm better at speed chess than you.
I play a lot in New York.

450
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:51,875
- You beat me in Las Vegas.
- That was a while ago.

451
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:54,166
You were too hung up on doubling my pawns.

452
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,166
I don't think
I could get away with that again.

453
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,750
Do you ever go over games in your head?

454
00:41:04,583 --> 00:41:06,833
When you're alone.
Play all the way through them?

455
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:09,958
Doesn't everybody?

456
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,583
Well, I never thought
you'd let me trade queens.

457
00:41:36,666 --> 00:41:37,750
I didn't think so, either.

458
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:40,166
Thirty moves, man, Jesus.

459
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:41,916
That many?

460
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,958
Hmm.

461
00:41:44,541 --> 00:41:46,208
Looks like you can outdrink me, too.

462
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:50,416
I really appreciate
how you're taking this.

463
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:54,333
- I'm raging inwardly.
- Well, it doesn't show.

464
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:57,500
Should never have played
that goddamn bishop pawn.

465
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,458
- No, probably not.
- What are you gonna do about Borgov?

466
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:03,916
I don't know.

467
00:42:04,666 --> 00:42:07,291
I don't even have a passport.
Or the right clothes.

468
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:09,791
I hear it's pretty cold in Paris
that time of year.

469
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:12,583
I'm not talking about Paris.
I'm talking about Moscow.

470
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:16,666
What, do they not deliver mail
in Kentucky?

471
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,833
What's in Moscow?

472
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:21,541
The Moscow Invitational.

473
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:24,541
The US winner gets invited.
You didn't know that?

474
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:29,833
- Yes, ma'am.
- A couple more, please.

475
00:42:29,916 --> 00:42:33,666
- Uh, no, thanks. I'm still on my first.
- Well, I'll drink them both.

476
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:36,291
Easy there, tiger.

477
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:41,625
How do I get to Moscow if I go?

478
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:43,333
Uh, well, I mean, when I went,

479
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:47,291
the Federation paid for my ticket,
and then this church group

480
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:48,541
covered the rest of it.

481
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:49,750
Did you have a second?

482
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,916
- Weiss.
- Weiss?

483
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,250
It would be tough to go to Russia alone.

484
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,791
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

485
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:04,500
You always drink this much?

486
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:08,541
Sometimes, I drink more.

487
00:43:11,083 --> 00:43:13,083
Who else will be playing in Moscow?

488
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:17,250
Four top Russians,
and four other countries.

489
00:43:18,541 --> 00:43:20,625
If you keep doing this,
you're gonna end up washed up

490
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:21,916
by the time you're 21.

491
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:28,625
I like your hair.

492
00:43:30,166 --> 00:43:31,000
Uh-huh.

493
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:33,000
Yeah, sure you do.

494
00:43:34,625 --> 00:43:35,750
What about Moscow?

495
00:43:37,666 --> 00:43:40,583
Four Soviet chess players
is a lot of Soviet chess players.

496
00:43:41,416 --> 00:43:42,291
Murderous.

497
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:44,875
But you're the only American

498
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:47,083
I can think of
that might be able to do it.

499
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,166
I went to pieces
with Borgov in Mexico City.

500
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:55,625
When do you go to Paris?

501
00:43:57,166 --> 00:43:58,458
In five weeks.

502
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:02,041
Well, you'll need a good trainer.

503
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,125
Not Harry Beltik.

504
00:44:06,125 --> 00:44:06,958
Someone…

505
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:09,791
- Better.
- Mmm.

506
00:44:10,416 --> 00:44:13,041
Someone more, um, mature.

507
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,166
Who'd you have in mind?

508
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:19,750
Can you come to New York?

509
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:24,083
I don't know.

510
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:27,916
You can sleep in my living room,
and you can leave for Paris from there.

511
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:29,750
That's very nice of you,

512
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:33,291
but I'm not even so sure
I wanna go to Paris anymore.

513
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:38,041
What are you gonna do instead, huh?
Get drunk?

514
00:44:38,125 --> 00:44:41,333
Now that you mention it,
yeah, sounds pretty good.

515
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,291
Beth…

516
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:46,458
Borgov made me look like a fool.

517
00:44:46,541 --> 00:44:49,291
- That's 'cause you weren't ready.
- I don't know if I'm good enough.

518
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:51,041
You're the best there is.

519
00:44:52,166 --> 00:44:53,625
You beat me.

520
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:02,458
Okay, fine. I'll come to New York.

521
00:45:02,541 --> 00:45:03,375
Great.

522
00:45:06,875 --> 00:45:08,750
We'll leave from here. I'll drive us.

523
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:11,666
- When?
- Tomorrow. Afternoon.

524
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:14,333
Once everything here finishes up.

525
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:16,125
Oh, and about sex…

526
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:20,500
Forget it.
