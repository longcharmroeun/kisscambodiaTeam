1
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,625
<i>You should have seen yourself.</i>

2
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:19,666
<i>Up on that stool,
floating around up there,</i>

3
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:22,958
Deardorff just hollering at you.

4
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:24,625
It felt funny.

5
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:25,541
Shit.

6
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:27,666
I bet it felt good.

7
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:31,958
What you gonna do at night?

8
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:36,916
I'm gonna stay awake as long as I can,
reading my book,

9
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,625
learning the Sicilian Defense.

10
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:45,375
There's 57 pages about it in the book,

11
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:48,791
with 170 lines stemming from P to QB4.

12
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,583
I'm gonna memorize them
and play through them all in my mind.

13
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:55,833
Poor mind.

14
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,416
<i>Ladies, don't run!</i>

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,791
No shoving!

16
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,208
Mr. Shaibel?

17
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:30,083
They won't let me play anymore.

18
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:34,125
I'm being punished.

19
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,041
Please…

20
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:40,708
Can you help me?

21
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,833
I wish I could play more with you.

22
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,958
For crying out loud,
what you still doing in bed?

23
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,458
You're gonna miss breakfast.

24
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:42,666
Morning, cracker.

25
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,708
You don't wanna miss
another delicious breakfast, do you?

26
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,208
Been dreaming about it.

27
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,000
Wonder who they're here for.

28
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,791
Hi, Beth.

29
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,750
- Are you trying to piss her off?
- I had to take a shower.

30
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:07,666
Go on in, then.

31
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,458
Hold up.

32
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,875
They seem like nice people.

33
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm told, Elizabeth,
that you turned 13 just last month.

34
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,083
Actually, I'm fift...

35
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,208
Yes, that's right, I'm 13.

36
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,166
Such a wonderful age.

37
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,541
Elizabeth has performed well
in all of her schoolwork.

38
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:48,833
She is at the top of her class
in reading and arithmetic.

39
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,083
That's very impressive.

40
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:54,083
Beth is also a very strong student
in science and geography,

41
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:57,375
and has been kindly assisting
Miss Lonsdale with chapel,

42
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,125
for several years now.

43
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,125
She is the model Methuen girl.

44
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,041
I can see that.

45
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,791
I will leave you three to get acquainted.

46
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,250
They call you Elizabeth?

47
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,291
Or is it Betty?

48
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,791
You should go pack.

49
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,375
I can't find my book.

50
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:04,458
Which book we talking about?
You read like a hundred of them.

51
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,708
<i>Modern Chess Openings.</i>

52
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,000
Hm. Beats the shit out of me.

53
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,500
I left it right here.

54
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,791
- You didn't see it, did you?
- Watch who you go accusing.

55
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,541
I got no use for no book like that.

56
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,375
Anyway, you don't need no book.

57
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:26,583
Just say, "Yes, sir," and "Yes, ma'am,"
and you'll do all right.

58
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:30,250
Tell them you're grateful
to be in a Christian home like theirs.

59
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,416
Maybe they'll put a TV in your room.

60
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,250
Jolene?

61
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:39,458
Hm?

62
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:43,875
I'm sorry.

63
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,291
About what?

64
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,625
That you didn't get adopted.

65
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:53,875
Shit.

66
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,416
I make out just fine right here.

67
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,166
Be a good girl, Elizabeth.

68
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,500
Off we go!

69
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,583
We're so glad to have an older child.

70
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,291
Shall we?

71
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,041
Home sweet home.

72
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,000
Those are Rosa Bonheur prints.

73
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,166
Not originals, of course.

74
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,000
Do you like animals?

75
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,291
I do, I love them.

76
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,750
Allston is allergic
to most pet dander, though,

77
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,833
so I'm not allowed to...

78
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,250
I bet you'd like to see your room.

79
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,375
This is the master bedroom,
where Allston and I sleep.

80
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,833
Over here is the bathroom,

81
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,875
and this is you.

82
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:05,500
You have no idea how hard it is
to find good maple furniture.

83
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,708
This is all mine?

84
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:08,916
Of course it's all yours.

85
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,000
The whole room?

86
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,208
The whole room.

87
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,208
All right.

88
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,750
I will let you unpack and get settled in.

89
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Just give a holler if you need anything.

90
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:36,833
Home sweet home.

91
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,208
I don't understand.

92
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,541
I don't know exactly
what there is to understand.

93
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,708
- Why can't they send someone else?
- It's only for two weeks.

94
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,791
You've only been home for two days.

95
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,708
Gives you some time
to get to know your new companion.

96
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,333
I doubt there's much to know.

97
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,625
Girl doesn't seem
to have a heck of a lot to say.

98
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,208
Do you have to take the car?

99
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,458
How am I supposed
to get around without a car?

100
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,375
I don't know, you could rent one.

101
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,541
And eat up half my commissions?
You're a terrible driver anyway.

102
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,458
It's not that far into town.

103
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,708
Remember what the doctor said.
Some exercise will do you good.

104
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,333
It's early, dear.

105
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,291
You don't have to be up
for another hour yet.

106
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,750
Must be all the excitement
about your first day of school.

107
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,916
Where did Mr. Wheatley go?

108
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,583
Business trip.

109
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,375
Poor man has to travel
quite a bit these days, but…

110
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,000
As he likes to remind me, it…

111
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,666
Keeps the roof over our heads.

112
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,625
Please stop gawking, dear,
you're making me nervous.

113
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,875
You're very good.

114
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,000
This was Grandmother June's piano.

115
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,458
I've played since I was younger than you.

116
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:45,000
I'd always had it in my mind
to one day play in an orchestra.

117
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,000
Probably still could.

118
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,041
Mmm. As luck would have it,

119
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:52,125
I've also always suffered
from a terrible case of stage fright,

120
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,375
which does not bode well
for an aspiring performer.

121
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,166
And then I got pregnant.

122
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,083
You have a child?

123
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,250
We did, yes.

124
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,291
Are you hungry?

125
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,791
We have a leftover casserole.

126
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:20,875
Beth, dear.

127
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,250
Are you sure
you don't want me to go with you?

128
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,208
I'm okay.

129
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:30,416
Okay.

130
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,666
You should have seen that coach.

131
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,916
Have you seen her hair and her shoes?

132
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,333
Don't know.

133
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,000
So drab.

134
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,583
And brown laces
with brown shoes? I mean…

135
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,416
Quiet, please! Let's start.

136
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,666
This week, we will begin to study
the binomial theorem.

137
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,375
Does anyone know what a binomial is?

138
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:42,708
Anyone?

139
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:50,916
Yes?

140
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,750
- A binomial is a mathematical...
- Will you stand up, please?

141
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:03,833
A binomial is a mathematical expression
containing two terms.

142
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,958
X plus Y is a binomial.

143
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,125
Very good.

144
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,291
Let's turn to page 24.

145
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,625
Great, another fucking brain.

146
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,583
That's a good idea. Oh, my god.

147
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,416
- Is there a school chess club?
- What?

148
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:14,208
Is there a chess club here at the school?

149
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,291
Oh.

150
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:16,916
Um…

151
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,625
I don't think they have
anything like that.

152
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,083
But a lot of the girls
belong to social clubs.

153
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,458
Social clubs?

154
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,375
There's the Apple Pi club,

155
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,750
and the Sub Debs,

156
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,166
- and Girls Around Town.
- Apple pie? They bake pies?

157
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,833
No, Apple Pi.
You know, like the Greek letter.

158
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,083
Oh.

159
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,125
Are you in one of those?

160
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,708
You have to be invited…

161
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,291
To join.

162
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,125
You could try out for junior cheerleader.

163
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,750
Shit.

164
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,958
Hello, Mr. Wheatley.

165
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,375
Oh.

166
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,208
Hi… Beth.

167
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:33,458
You're home!
I didn't expect you for another week.

168
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,666
I'm only here for the night.

169
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,416
They, uh…
they just gave me the whole Southwest, so…

170
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,333
And a raise, I hope?

171
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,625
Don't start.

172
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,708
Yes, why don't you freshen up,
and I will start dinner?

173
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:46,875
I'll take a beer.

174
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,125
If there's any left.

175
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,083
Doesn't she ever change clothes?

176
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,500
I don't think he likes me very much.

177
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:06,833
Quite the opposite.

178
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,708
Adopting you was actually his idea.

179
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,875
He's right, though.
You could use some new clothes.

180
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,041
Sorry.

181
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,666
Aha!

182
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:15,666
They have chess sets.

183
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,750
We can stop on the way back down.

184
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:37,875
Oh…

185
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,416
Let's find you a blouse.

186
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,208
Well, don't you look lovely?

187
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,291
The shoes are a little big.

188
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,458
Room to grow, dear.
Room to grow.

189
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:54,708
Let's look for coats.

190
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,083
Mmm. Lovely.

191
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:04,333
Step over here
so I can see the fabric in the light.

192
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,041
Yes, this will do nicely.

193
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,625
Aren't we gonna look at the chess sets?

194
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,208
Another time, dear.

195
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,666
It's getting late, and I'm getting hungry.

196
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,000
- But...
- I'll give you 40 cents a week allowance.

197
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,208
Save up and buy yourself a chess set.

198
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,166
Saving is a good lesson
for a girl to learn.

199
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:08,875
So bad!

200
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,833
- Do you have any books on chess?
- Chess?

201
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,375
Mm. I don't know for sure.

202
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,583
If we have anything,
it'll be on the last row.

203
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,458
Thank you.

204
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,041
There might be an old biography
on José Capablanca.

205
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,541
- Who?
- José Capablanca.

206
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:45,625
He was a Grandmaster.
It was quite a long time ago now.

207
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,083
What's a Grandmaster?

208
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,541
A genius player.

209
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:37,583
Okay, yeah.

210
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,458
I see you, Harmon.

211
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:41,625
It's those shoes.

212
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,708
Did you get them
at Ben Snyder's or something?

213
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,916
I wouldn't be caught dead
in Ben Snyder's.

214
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,875
- How was school?
- Fun.

215
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:01,708
Where are you going?

216
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,791
I'm gonna replay
some of the matches in this book.

217
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:08,833
- But you don't have a board.
- In my head.

218
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,166
Good mental exercise.

219
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,958
Well, some physical exercise
could do you good.

220
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:20,125
Will you run over to Bradley's for me,

221
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:22,500
and pick up three packs of Chesterfields?

222
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:24,208
Yes, ma'am.

223
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:31,750
I'll write you a note.

224
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,583
You look a bit youthful
for smoking, yourself.

225
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:12,208
Young lady!

226
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:16,000
You have to buy the magazine
or put it back.

227
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,583
- Can't I just...
- You wanna read? Read the sign.

228
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,458
No, it's all the same oil,
it's just three different sizes.

229
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:48,208
If you don't use a lot,
you wanna buy that one,

230
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:51,500
because it does go bad,
but this is the best value for the money.

231
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,750
If you can't decide, get the middle one.
It's not rocket science.

232
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:13,500
Thank you, dear.

233
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:22,291
Well, that's the last
of the instant coffee.

234
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:26,750
I'd go shopping, but I just don't know
where all the money goes.

235
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:29,125
I've bought little more
than trifles this month,

236
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:32,000
and yet I have seven dollars left
where I should have at least 20.

237
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:33,000
Seven dollars?

238
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:36,708
- Is that enough?
- To last till the end of October?

239
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:37,625
I think not.

240
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:40,625
It'll scarcely buy
chicken necks and porridge.

241
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:43,791
- Doesn't Methuen send you a check?
- For 80 dollars.

242
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:45,625
And only for the first year.

243
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:48,375
As if the expense of keeping you
doesn't exhaust it.

244
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,625
I'm afraid you'll have to go
without an allowance

245
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:54,916
until Allston returns.

246
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:57,750
Which is when?

247
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:58,750
Who can say?

248
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,083
It seems he's been
unavoidably detained out West.

249
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,000
Maybe I could get a job.

250
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:13,000
A job?

251
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:16,166
I could work in a store,
or wash dishes somewhere.

252
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,375
Wash dishes?

253
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:18,875
I'd like to make some money.

254
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:21,708
Oh, to buy clothes with, I suspect.

255
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:25,291
To enter chess tournaments.

256
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:27,458
There's one here.

257
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:30,958
But it's five dollars
for the entrance fee.

258
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:34,416
The only girls of your age
who work are colored.

259
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:39,500
<i>Dear Mr. Shaibel,</i>

260
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:44,333
<i>there's a chess tournament here
with a first prize of 100 dollars,</i>

261
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:46,375
<i>and a second prize of 50 dollars.</i>

262
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,791
<i>There are other prizes, too.</i>

263
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:55,041
<i>It costs five dollars to enter,
and I don't have that.</i>

264
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:01,250
<i>If you'll send me the money,</i>

265
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:04,750
<i>I will pay you back ten dollars
if I win any prize at all.</i>

266
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:14,416
Beth, is that you?

267
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:21,083
I seem to have caught a cold.

268
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:22,625
Another one?

269
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:25,250
Mm. I have a proclivity for viruses, or…

270
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,625
They for me.

271
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,416
Uh… here.

272
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,916
I need you
to fill this prescription for me.

273
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:36,291
And while you're there…

274
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,416
Buy yourself a Coke.

275
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:44,041
Thanks.

276
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:49,208
Be just a minute.

277
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:05,291
Here you go.

278
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:14,958
<i>My tranquility medicine.</i>

279
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:21,791
Dr. Talbott has decided
I need more tranquility. Much more.

280
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:25,833
- Will you get me a glass of water, dear?
- Yes, ma'am.

281
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:29,500
Why do they
only fill these bottles half full?

282
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:39,583
Excuse you, Harmon.

283
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:40,666
Fuck you, Margaret.

284
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:42,458
<i>Beth,</i>

285
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:43,625
this came for you.

286
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:55,666
Thank you.

287
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:58,291
Mm-hm.

288
00:31:31,708 --> 00:31:33,166
Tell Alma to go easy.

289
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,500
She's only got three refills left.

290
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:42,791
<i>For a trip the White House
again calls non-political…</i>

291
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:45,708
- You're home late.
<i>- …Political-looking escort</i>

292
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:48,375
<i>of 17 Democratic congressmen,
and Mrs. Kennedy…</i>

293
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:51,208
- I was out walking.
- <i>…who was featured at the arrival…</i>

294
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:53,041
Okay. Good night.

295
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:55,000
Good night.

296
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:56,791
<i>…turning on the smile that hasn't been…</i>

297
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,041
Oh, um…

298
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:03,250
I'm gonna be late again tomorrow.
I have something after school.

299
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:05,375
Have you joined a club?

300
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:08,375
I'm playing in that chess tournament
I told you about.

301
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,000
I won't argue
that broadening one's social life

302
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:15,125
is important for a girl your age.

303
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:17,958
I just wonder whether a dance class
or a girls' club

304
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:20,166
wouldn't be better for making friendships.

305
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:22,875
I hear Fairfield has pretty good ones.

306
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:26,750
When you were my age,
how did you broaden your social life?

307
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:30,291
The tournament goes until Sunday.

308
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,125
- Do you have a clock?
- No.

309
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:02,333
We have a clock-sharing system.
If your opponent doesn't have one,

310
00:33:02,416 --> 00:33:03,958
come back, and we'll loan you one.

311
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,208
Play starts in 20 minutes.

312
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:07,500
What's your rating?

313
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,375
I don't have a rating.

314
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,875
- Have you played in a tournament before?
- No.

315
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:18,333
- Are you sure you wanna do this?
- I'm sure.

316
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:20,208
We don't have a women's section.

317
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,166
- I'll put you in beginners.
- I'm not a beginner.

318
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,250
Doesn't matter.

319
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,416
If you're an unrated player,

320
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,833
you go in beginners
with the people under 1600.

321
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,083
- What's the prize for beginners?
- Twenty.

322
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:36,875
- What about the other section?
- First prize in the Open is 100.

323
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:39,208
Is it against any rule
for me to be in the Open?

324
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:41,750
- Not exactly.
- Put me in the Open.

325
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,375
There are three guys in there
with ratings over 1800.

326
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:47,041
And Beltik may show up.

327
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:48,833
They will eat you alive.

328
00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:55,291
"Harmon."

329
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,666
Are the matches played at random?

330
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:51,041
Oh, not at all.

331
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:53,416
Uh…

332
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,625
Uh, they arrange it by ratings
on the first round.

333
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:02,375
After that, winners play winners,
and losers, losers.

334
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:07,916
Good luck.

335
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:10,750
You, too.

336
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:22,875
Hi.

337
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:29,625
Hi.

338
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:33,000
- Annette Packer.
- Beth Harmon.

339
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:37,833
- I don't understand about chess clocks.
- Oh.

340
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,333
Um…

341
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:42,041
The clock faced nearest you
measures your playing time.

342
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:44,000
Each player has 90 minutes.

343
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:46,625
After you move,
you press that button on top,

344
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:48,750
and it stops your clock
and starts your opponent's.

345
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:52,125
And you see that little red flag
over the number 12 on each clock?

346
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:54,250
Yours will fall down
when the 90 minutes is up,

347
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:55,708
and if it does that…

348
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:58,208
You've lost.

349
00:35:58,291 --> 00:35:59,500
And, um…

350
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:02,333
For recording your moves.

351
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:03,416
Right.

352
00:36:09,791 --> 00:36:12,791
- You can start your clocks now.
- You can start my clock now.

353
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,041
Why do they put the girls together?

354
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:16,333
They're not supposed to…

355
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,375
But, if you win, they move you up.

356
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:25,583
- Oh, it's touch move.
- What's that?

357
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:28,250
Don't touch a piece
unless you're going to move it.

358
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:30,375
If you touch it,
you have to move it somewhere.

359
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:31,375
Okay.

360
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:38,000
Don't you push your button now?

361
00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:40,416
Sorry.

362
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:46,000
What I do with this?

363
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:48,791
Is your match over?

364
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:50,000
Yes, I won.

365
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:52,708
That was fast.

366
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:55,250
What do I do with this?

367
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:58,000
Circle your name
and drop it in the basket.

368
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:15,500
- Who are they?
- Beltik and Cullen.

369
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:18,500
- Beltik's the State Champion.
- Which is which?

370
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:25,125
- Beltik's the younger one.
- Is he a Grandmaster?

371
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:26,208
He's working on it.

372
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:27,333
Takes time.

373
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,416
You have to play Grandmasters
to become one.

374
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,625
- How much time?
- Do you mind?

375
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:40,625
Draw?

376
00:38:43,916 --> 00:38:45,083
Hell, no.

377
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,708
Yes!

378
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:34,375
That's check.

379
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,625
I know what it is.

380
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:50,166
Draw?

381
00:39:58,375 --> 00:39:59,208
You got me.

382
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:00,250
I resign.

383
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:28,166
Dinner break.

384
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:31,625
Next round is at six o'clock.
Then, three more tomorrow.

385
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,791
Final round is Sunday, 11 a.m.

386
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:40,708
Harmon?

387
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:42,958
Keep it up, kid.

388
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,125
<i>I think he knew you killed his brother.</i>

389
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,916
<i>- You're in trouble…</i>
- Yours is in the oven.

390
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,500
<i>Someone's always crowding me.</i>

391
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:57,375
- How did you do at your thing?
- I won four games.

392
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:00,416
That's nice, good for you.

393
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,666
Yes, Harmon?

394
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:14,583
You said there were three people here
with a rating higher than 1800.

395
00:41:14,666 --> 00:41:17,458
- That's right.
- I thought I'd be playing one of them.

396
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:18,875
Them's the breaks, Harmon.

397
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:20,166
Consider yourself lucky.

398
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:22,083
I want to play the best.

399
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:24,541
You have to get a rating
before that happens.

400
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:25,916
How do I get a rating?

401
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,250
You play 30 games in USCF tournaments,
then wait four months.

402
00:41:29,916 --> 00:41:32,250
- That's how you get a rating.
- That's too long.

403
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,166
I want to play Beltik.

404
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,333
If you win your next three games,
and if Beltik does the same.

405
00:41:37,416 --> 00:41:38,375
I will win them.

406
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:42,250
No, Harmon, you won't. You have to play
Sizemore or Goldman first.

407
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,625
You can't beat either of them.

408
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:46,125
Sizemore and Goldman? Shit.

409
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:48,750
Townes, the guy you're playing now,
is underrated.

410
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:51,250
He plays first board
for the university team,

411
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:53,541
and last month
he came in fifth in Las Vegas.

412
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:03,166
What's in Las Vegas?

413
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:04,833
The US Open.

414
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,333
Looks like we've been stalking each other.

415
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:41,333
You want to start my clock?

416
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,333
Sorry.

417
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:27,583
Jesus Christ, Harmon,
you're humiliating my rook.

418
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,041
He won't have to suffer much longer.

419
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,833
Damn.

420
00:45:04,625 --> 00:45:05,458
How old are you?

421
00:45:06,375 --> 00:45:07,250
Never mind.

422
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:10,583
- Don't answer that, it'll just depress me.
- I'm 36.

423
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:13,000
Thank you.

424
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:17,250
You really are something, you know that?

425
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:23,833
Shall we turn in our sheets?

426
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,416
Um… you go ahead.

427
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,291
I'm gonna study the board a little longer.

428
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:33,250
Wow.

429
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:50,833
Damn it!

430
00:45:55,916 --> 00:45:57,833
Damn!

431
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:06,666
I just wanted to tell you
that I've never seen anything like…

432
00:46:07,291 --> 00:46:08,333
Um…

433
00:46:08,416 --> 00:46:09,958
Do... Do you have something?

434
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,500
It's my first time.

435
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:15,958
Um…

436
00:46:19,333 --> 00:46:20,750
Do you know how to use it?

437
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:23,791
I think so.

438
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,583
I'll wait, just in case.

439
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,083
You're, uh…

440
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:35,083
You're moving right on up, aren't you?

441
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:37,166
So far.

442
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:42,208
Sizemore's pretty tough, though.

443
00:46:42,291 --> 00:46:43,291
Uh-huh.

444
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:02,958
Thank you.

445
00:47:04,666 --> 00:47:05,541
I didn't…

446
00:47:06,916 --> 00:47:07,791
I just thought…

447
00:47:10,958 --> 00:47:11,958
Thought I was sick.

448
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:15,208
My first time, I threw up.

449
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,625
Well, I still do sometimes.

450
00:47:20,208 --> 00:47:21,791
Actually, every time.

451
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:26,833
Well, I have to get back.

452
00:47:26,916 --> 00:47:27,750
Oh, sure.

453
00:47:29,875 --> 00:47:30,791
Hey, Beth.

454
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:33,416
Beat him, will you?

455
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:35,458
I'll try.

456
00:47:46,791 --> 00:47:49,083
Ready?

457
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:20,791
I've started menstruating.

458
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:27,250
Bit late in the day for you, isn't it?

459
00:48:31,666 --> 00:48:32,791
I'll need pads…

460
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:35,416
Something.

461
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,125
Just go up to my room,
to the top drawer of my chiffonier,

462
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:39,583
and take what you require.

463
00:48:43,041 --> 00:48:43,916
Oh, and, dear…

464
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:49,416
Be a good girl and get that little bottle
of green pills by my bedside.

465
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:54,291
My tranquility needs to be refurbished.

466
00:49:37,458 --> 00:49:38,291
Thank you.

467
00:49:42,541 --> 00:49:43,500
Is something wrong?

468
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:46,625
Wrong?

469
00:49:48,958 --> 00:49:50,375
I'm not Aristotle, but yes,

470
00:49:50,458 --> 00:49:52,708
I think something
could be construed as wrong.

471
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:57,333
I've received a message from Mr. Wheatley.

472
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:00,541
What did he say?

473
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,375
It seems Mr. Wheatley…

474
00:50:05,458 --> 00:50:08,333
Has been indefinitely detained
in the Southwest.

475
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,333
Somewhere between Denver and Butte.

476
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:20,416
Though, Aristotle was a moral philosopher,
and I'm just a housewife.

477
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:23,666
Or I was a housewife.

478
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:30,916
Can they send me back
if you no longer have a husband?

479
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:36,875
You put it concretely.

480
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:44,875
They won't if we lie about it.

481
00:50:48,166 --> 00:50:49,166
That's easy enough.

482
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:58,458
You're a good soul, Beth.

483
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:04,416
Why don't you heat up the chicken dinners
in the freezer, okay?

484
00:51:06,208 --> 00:51:07,666
Set the oven at 400.

485
00:51:10,458 --> 00:51:12,375
I don't know how to put these on.

486
00:51:21,041 --> 00:51:22,958
Though I'm no longer a wife,

487
00:51:23,875 --> 00:51:25,583
except by a legal fiction…

488
00:51:30,541 --> 00:51:32,708
I believe I can learn to be a mother.

489
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:38,791
I'll show you how…

490
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:42,583
If you promise to never go near Denver.

491
00:52:14,833 --> 00:52:15,750
<i>Mama?</i>

492
00:52:22,708 --> 00:52:23,958
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

493
00:53:05,666 --> 00:53:07,000
Sorry.

494
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:09,458
Extra cup of coffee.

495
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:14,750
Harry Beltik. What's your name?

496
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:17,000
Beth Harmon.

497
00:55:49,166 --> 00:55:50,250
Be right back.

498
00:56:09,916 --> 00:56:12,083
Come on, you ugly piece of trash.

499
00:56:13,666 --> 00:56:14,666
You can beat that…

500
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:17,750
Fucker.

501
00:57:46,875 --> 00:57:48,625
- Son of a bitch.
- I think that's it.

502
00:57:48,708 --> 00:57:51,208
- No, I can get out of this.
- I don't think so.

503
00:57:53,125 --> 00:57:55,250
Maybe, if you'd gotten here on time.

504
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:07,833
It doesn't work.

505
00:58:07,916 --> 00:58:09,666
- I don't have to use the queen.
- Move.

506
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:11,833
- I'll just cover it with the bishop and...
- Move.

507
00:58:46,791 --> 00:58:48,000
Do you see it now?

508
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,166
Or should we finish this on the board?

509
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:57,916
Son of a bitch.

510
00:59:12,041 --> 00:59:15,625
<i>"The world of Kentucky</i>
<i>chess was astonished this weekend</i>

511
00:59:15,708 --> 00:59:19,583
<i>by the playing of a local girl
who triumphed over hardened players</i>

512
00:59:19,666 --> 00:59:22,125
to win the Kentucky State Championship."

513
00:59:22,916 --> 00:59:26,666
"Elizabeth Harmon,
a student at Fairfield High,

514
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:30,291
showed a mastery of the game
unequaled by any female,

515
00:59:30,375 --> 00:59:32,000
according to Harry Beltik,

516
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:34,416
whom Miss Harmon defeated
for the state crown."

517
00:59:36,458 --> 00:59:37,750
And 100 dollars.

518
00:59:39,416 --> 00:59:40,250
You won this.

519
00:59:40,333 --> 00:59:41,916
I wanna open a bank account.

520
00:59:42,791 --> 00:59:45,791
But you have to go with me,
because I need a parent or a guardian.

521
00:59:45,875 --> 00:59:49,708
I just didn't have the faintest idea
that people made money playing chess.

522
00:59:49,791 --> 00:59:52,250
There's tournaments
with bigger prizes than that.

523
00:59:54,541 --> 00:59:55,416
How much bigger?

524
00:59:57,541 --> 00:59:58,625
Thousands of dollars.

525
00:59:59,708 --> 01:00:00,541
Goodness.

526
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,875
So, can we go
to the bank today after school?

527
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,833
Certainly.

528
01:01:08,208 --> 01:01:10,458
Beth, will you come down here, please?

529
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:15,208
What's wrong?

530
01:01:15,958 --> 01:01:18,375
I've been leafing
through this chess magazine.

531
01:01:18,458 --> 01:01:19,916
It's very interesting.

532
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:23,500
It says here that there is
a tournament in Cincinnati,

533
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:25,916
and the first prize is 500 dollars.

534
01:01:28,625 --> 01:01:31,708
The Greyhound bus
only requires two hours for the trip.

535
01:01:32,666 --> 01:01:34,208
I took the liberty of calling.

536
01:01:37,541 --> 01:01:38,708
What about school?

537
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:42,333
I could write a medical excuse
claiming mono.

538
01:01:42,416 --> 01:01:43,333
Mono?

539
01:01:43,416 --> 01:01:44,458
Mononucleosis.

540
01:01:44,541 --> 01:01:48,125
It's quite the thing in your age group,
according to the <i>Ladies Home Journal.</i>

541
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:52,541
Where would we stay?

542
01:01:53,041 --> 01:01:56,666
At the Gibson Hotel, in a double room
for 22 dollars a night.

543
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:01,041
The Greyhound tickets
would be $11.80 apiece,

544
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:03,166
plus the cost of food.

545
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:04,791
I've calculated all of it.

546
01:02:05,583 --> 01:02:08,125
Even if you only won
second or third prize,

547
01:02:08,833 --> 01:02:10,333
there would still be a profit.

548
01:02:11,875 --> 01:02:12,708
I'll win.

549
01:02:14,416 --> 01:02:16,375
I have every confidence.
