1
00:00:53,497 --> 00:00:55,377
Please. Please.

2
00:00:55,457 --> 00:00:57,957
I have credits. Take them.

3
00:01:51,221 --> 00:01:52,731
He says you spilled his drink.

4
00:01:58,353 --> 00:01:59,723
It's fine.

5
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:01,819
It's on me.

6
00:02:08,322 --> 00:02:09,332
Here.

7
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:43,481
Thank you! Thank you very much!

8
00:02:44,107 --> 00:02:47,277
You have my heartfelt gratitude.

9
00:02:51,281 --> 00:02:53,241
You know what? Here.

10
00:02:53,325 --> 00:02:54,695
You take my credits.

11
00:02:55,536 --> 00:02:56,746
Buy yourself a drink.

12
00:02:59,414 --> 00:03:00,574
Oh.

13
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:01,916
Is that a bounty puck?

14
00:03:05,504 --> 00:03:06,754
Is that me?

15
00:03:10,384 --> 00:03:13,508
Look...
Uh, there must be some mistake.

16
00:03:13,595 --> 00:03:15,215
I can get you more credits.

17
00:03:15,305 --> 00:03:16,985
I can bring you in warm...

18
00:03:18,642 --> 00:03:20,402
Or I can bring you in cold.

19
00:03:45,711 --> 00:03:47,631
I need passage to the yards.

20
00:04:03,395 --> 00:04:05,395
No droids.

21
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,390
Where to?

22
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,280
You know what he's looking for?

23
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:52,279
You're looking for Ravinaks, right?

24
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:54,281
It's clear right now.

25
00:04:54,947 --> 00:04:57,117
But be careful near the port.

26
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,909
Everyone dumps their Gray Holds out.

27
00:04:59,993 --> 00:05:04,113
They think the whole entire planet
is their own personal stink pit.

28
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,800
Here you are.

29
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:20,255
- You're kidding me, right?
- Get out.

30
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:24,021
I'll hire us a Livery Cruiser.

31
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:26,151
No big deal.
It won't come out of your end.

32
00:05:26,228 --> 00:05:27,478
I'll pay for it.

33
00:05:28,313 --> 00:05:29,973
I'm just trying to make it pleasant.

34
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:32,145
Hey, it's time to go, so let's settle up.

35
00:05:36,238 --> 00:05:38,448
I'd stay off the ice if I were you.

36
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:43,289
You think there's really something
to worry about?

37
00:05:56,758 --> 00:05:59,098
Open the hatch! Open the hatch!

38
00:06:16,361 --> 00:06:18,201
Dank farrik, that was close!

39
00:06:18,614 --> 00:06:20,694
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

40
00:06:20,782 --> 00:06:21,792
"Stay off the ice."

41
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:23,747
That's the understatement
of the millennium.

42
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:33,203
It's taking us down. What're you doing?

43
00:06:36,965 --> 00:06:39,175
It's got us. It's gonna take us under.

44
00:06:40,427 --> 00:06:41,427
Where you going?

45
00:06:41,512 --> 00:06:43,562
You got to do something!
We got to get out of here!

46
00:07:03,116 --> 00:07:05,996
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

47
00:07:06,078 --> 00:07:07,708
Yes. All right.

48
00:07:24,596 --> 00:07:25,846
Whew.

49
00:07:27,641 --> 00:07:30,691
I like your ship. She's a classic.

50
00:07:32,312 --> 00:07:34,022
Razor Crest, am I right?

51
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,609
Pre-Empire?

52
00:07:38,986 --> 00:07:40,906
I have a lot of credits, by the way.

53
00:07:40,988 --> 00:07:42,948
That's why I offered to hail a Cruiser.

54
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:50,961
How much are they paying you?

55
00:07:55,085 --> 00:07:57,755
Is it true that you guys
never take off your helmets?

56
00:08:01,049 --> 00:08:02,969
Boy.

57
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,600
I think I have to use the vacc tube.

58
00:08:08,348 --> 00:08:09,888
I mean I can do it here,

59
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:14,017
but if you've never seen
a Fledgling Mythrol evacuate their thorax,

60
00:08:14,104 --> 00:08:15,604
you're a lucky guy, trust me.

61
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:22,951
Clearly, there's nowhere for me to go.

62
00:08:23,405 --> 00:08:24,445
So, uh...

63
00:08:25,032 --> 00:08:27,622
I'm gonna look for that vacc tube
if it's all the same to you?

64
00:08:28,702 --> 00:08:29,752
Great.

65
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:44,216
Found it!

66
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:47,428
Thanks. It might take a while.

67
00:08:47,513 --> 00:08:48,883
I'm molting.

68
00:09:07,366 --> 00:09:09,116
Oh, this feels a lot better.

69
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,040
I haven't evacuated since the solstice.

70
00:09:17,626 --> 00:09:18,706
Yeah.

71
00:09:19,127 --> 00:09:21,917
I was hoping to be free for Life Day.

72
00:09:22,923 --> 00:09:24,123
Maybe even, uh...

73
00:09:29,096 --> 00:09:31,806
Get home to the family.

74
00:09:38,397 --> 00:09:41,107
But I guess that's
not gonna happen this year.

75
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:42,531
Probably not.

76
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:53,889
Ah, that was fast.

77
00:10:54,681 --> 00:10:56,101
Did you catch them all?

78
00:11:02,105 --> 00:11:03,725
Good. I'll begin the off-load.

79
00:11:15,035 --> 00:11:16,635
These are Imperial Credits.

80
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,420
They still spend.

81
00:11:18,497 --> 00:11:20,837
I don't know if you heard,
but the Empire is gone.

82
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:22,747
It's all I've got.

83
00:11:24,962 --> 00:11:26,842
Save the theatrics.

84
00:11:27,381 --> 00:11:28,631
Fine, I'll...

85
00:11:30,634 --> 00:11:32,464
I can do Calamari Flan...

86
00:11:33,053 --> 00:11:34,843
But I can only pay half.

87
00:11:38,308 --> 00:11:39,518
Fine.

88
00:11:57,911 --> 00:11:59,671
Hmm.
I have a bail jumper...

89
00:12:00,831 --> 00:12:02,381
A bail jumper,

90
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:06,171
another bail jumper, a wanted smuggler.

91
00:12:06,253 --> 00:12:07,453
I'll take them all.

92
00:12:07,546 --> 00:12:08,796
No. Hold on.

93
00:12:09,923 --> 00:12:13,673
There are other members of the Guild,
and this is all I have.

94
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,010
Why so slow?

95
00:12:15,095 --> 00:12:17,515
It's not slow at all, actually. Very busy.

96
00:12:17,598 --> 00:12:19,938
They just don't want to pay Guild rates.

97
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:22,559
They don't mind if things get sloppy.

98
00:12:23,896 --> 00:12:26,066
- What's your highest bounty?
- Not much.

99
00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:27,782
Five thousand.

100
00:12:27,858 --> 00:12:29,948
That won't even cover fuel these days.

101
00:12:30,694 --> 00:12:31,774
Hmm.

102
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:35,579
There is one job.

103
00:12:38,368 --> 00:12:39,908
Let's see the puck.

104
00:12:40,454 --> 00:12:41,494
No puck.

105
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:43,377
Face to face.

106
00:12:43,874 --> 00:12:44,954
Direct commission.

107
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:47,051
Deep pocket.

108
00:12:47,586 --> 00:12:48,586
Underworld?

109
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,430
All I know is no chain code.

110
00:12:55,135 --> 00:12:57,345
Do you want the chit or not?

111
00:14:27,853 --> 00:14:31,103
Greef Karga said you were coming.

112
00:14:38,906 --> 00:14:40,386
What else did he say?

113
00:14:40,908 --> 00:14:43,618
He said you were the best in the parsec.

114
00:14:48,957 --> 00:14:50,018
- Freeze!
- No!

115
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:51,402
Drop your weapons!

116
00:14:51,752 --> 00:14:53,229
No, no, no, no.
Pardon. Uh, sorry.

117
00:14:53,253 --> 00:14:56,253
I didn't mean to alarm.

118
00:14:58,675 --> 00:14:59,925
This is Doctor Pershing.

119
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:03,681
Please excuse his lack of decorum.

120
00:15:05,015 --> 00:15:08,345
His enthusiasm outweighs his discretion.

121
00:15:08,894 --> 00:15:10,554
Please lower your blaster.

122
00:15:10,646 --> 00:15:12,476
Have them lower theirs first.

123
00:15:12,814 --> 00:15:14,374
We have you four to one.

124
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:16,427
I like those odds.

125
00:15:20,948 --> 00:15:23,738
He also said you were expensive.

126
00:15:24,368 --> 00:15:25,868
Very expensive.

127
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,540
Please sit.

128
00:15:52,604 --> 00:15:53,644
Beskar?

129
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,940
Go ahead. It's real.

130
00:15:59,111 --> 00:16:01,161
This is only a down payment.

131
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:07,410
I have a camtono of Beskar waiting for you
upon delivery of the asset.

132
00:16:07,494 --> 00:16:08,494
Alive.

133
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:10,369
Yes. Alive.

134
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,749
Although, I acknowledge

135
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:16,628
that bounty hunting
is a complicated profession.

136
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:18,879
This being the case,

137
00:16:19,423 --> 00:16:24,713
proof of termination is also acceptable
for a lower fee.

138
00:16:25,554 --> 00:16:27,424
That is not what we agreed upon.

139
00:16:28,015 --> 00:16:30,305
I'm simply being pragmatic.

140
00:16:31,852 --> 00:16:33,292
Let's see the puck.

141
00:16:33,937 --> 00:16:36,477
I'm afraid discretion dictates

142
00:16:37,357 --> 00:16:39,947
a less traditional agreement.

143
00:16:40,194 --> 00:16:42,984
We can only offer you a tracking fob.

144
00:16:47,743 --> 00:16:49,153
What's the chain code?

145
00:16:49,703 --> 00:16:52,913
We can only provide the last four digits.

146
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,748
Their age? That's all you can give me?

147
00:16:57,669 --> 00:17:00,169
Yes. They're 50 years old.

148
00:17:01,131 --> 00:17:04,801
We can also give you
last reported positional data.

149
00:17:04,885 --> 00:17:07,715
Between that and the fob,

150
00:17:07,804 --> 00:17:11,594
a man of your skill
should make short work of this.

151
00:17:20,943 --> 00:17:25,733
The Beskar belongs back
into the hands of a Mandalorian.

152
00:17:26,365 --> 00:17:29,695
It is good to restore
the natural order of things

153
00:17:29,785 --> 00:17:32,285
after a period of such disarray,

154
00:17:33,288 --> 00:17:34,668
don't you agree?

155
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:45,511
This was gathered
in the Great Purge.

156
00:19:46,713 --> 00:19:48,333
It is good it is back with the Tribe.

157
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:50,089
Yes.

158
00:19:51,134 --> 00:19:52,964
A pauldron would be in order.

159
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:57,059
- Has your signet been revealed?
- Not yet.

160
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:58,980
Soon.

161
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:38,060
This is extremely generous.
The excess will sponsor many Foundlings.

162
00:20:38,932 --> 00:20:40,092
That's good.

163
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:42,649
I was once a Foundling.

164
00:20:42,728 --> 00:20:43,768
I know.

165
00:23:38,362 --> 00:23:40,702
Thank you.

166
00:23:42,074 --> 00:23:44,074
You are a bounty hunter.

167
00:23:45,077 --> 00:23:46,287
Yes.

168
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,670
I will help you.

169
00:23:54,753 --> 00:23:56,003
I have spoken.

170
00:24:13,397 --> 00:24:15,357
Many have passed through.

171
00:24:15,732 --> 00:24:17,902
They seek the same one as you.

172
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:19,739
Did you help them?

173
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,280
Yes.

174
00:24:21,989 --> 00:24:23,119
They died.

175
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,830
Well, then I don't know
if I want your help.

176
00:24:28,078 --> 00:24:29,498
You do.

177
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:32,038
I can show you to the encampment.

178
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:33,711
What's your cut?

179
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,962
Half.

180
00:24:35,043 --> 00:24:37,543
Half the bounty to guide? Seems steep.

181
00:24:38,213 --> 00:24:41,583
No. Half of the blurrg you helped capture.

182
00:24:41,675 --> 00:24:44,005
The blurrg? You can keep them both.

183
00:24:44,094 --> 00:24:45,804
No, you will need one.

184
00:24:46,597 --> 00:24:47,677
To ride.

185
00:24:48,056 --> 00:24:51,556
The way is impossible to pass
without a blurrg mount.

186
00:24:52,436 --> 00:24:54,186
I don't know how to ride blurrg.

187
00:24:55,439 --> 00:24:56,779
I have spoken.

188
00:25:05,157 --> 00:25:07,867
Perhaps if you removed your helmet.

189
00:25:07,951 --> 00:25:10,371
Perhaps he remembers I tried to roast him.

190
00:25:10,787 --> 00:25:15,207
This is a female.
The males are all eaten during mating.

191
00:25:44,905 --> 00:25:46,625
I don't have time for this.

192
00:25:46,657 --> 00:25:49,617
Do you have a Landspeeder
or Speeder bike that I could hire?

193
00:25:49,701 --> 00:25:51,081
You are Mandalorian!

194
00:25:52,913 --> 00:25:56,083
Your ancestors rode the great Mythosaur.

195
00:25:57,251 --> 00:26:00,051
Surely you can ride this young foal.

196
00:26:16,478 --> 00:26:19,068
Easy. Easy.

197
00:26:20,107 --> 00:26:22,947
Now, all right. Settle down.

198
00:26:24,027 --> 00:26:25,027
Whoa!

199
00:26:25,112 --> 00:26:27,582
Settle. Settle.

200
00:26:29,283 --> 00:26:30,943
That's good. That's good.

201
00:26:34,121 --> 00:26:36,421
Easy. Okay.

202
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:38,838
That's good.

203
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,260
All right.

204
00:26:53,557 --> 00:26:54,557
Oh!

205
00:27:43,774 --> 00:27:46,354
That is where you'll find your quarry.

206
00:27:50,864 --> 00:27:53,234
Please. You deserve this.

207
00:27:53,325 --> 00:27:55,365
Since these ones arrived,

208
00:27:55,452 --> 00:27:58,332
this territory has been an endless stream

209
00:27:58,413 --> 00:28:02,703
of mercenaries seeking reward
and bringing destruction.

210
00:28:03,544 --> 00:28:05,124
Then why did you guide me?

211
00:28:05,212 --> 00:28:07,092
They do not belong here.

212
00:28:07,172 --> 00:28:10,092
Those that live here come to seek peace.

213
00:28:10,175 --> 00:28:13,255
There will be no peace until they're gone.

214
00:28:14,388 --> 00:28:15,518
Then why do you help?

215
00:28:16,682 --> 00:28:18,892
I have never met a Mandalorian.

216
00:28:19,434 --> 00:28:21,394
I've only read the stories.

217
00:28:23,605 --> 00:28:27,435
If they are true,
you will make quick work of it.

218
00:28:28,235 --> 00:28:30,905
Then there will again be peace.

219
00:28:35,284 --> 00:28:36,614
I have spoken.

220
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:19,460
Oh, no.

221
00:29:20,204 --> 00:29:21,364
Bounty Droid.

222
00:29:22,289 --> 00:29:25,289
Subparagraph 16 of
the Bondsman Guild protocol waiver

223
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:28,455
compels you to immediately
produce said asset.

224
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,240
Droids.

225
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:55,160
Subparagraph 16 of
the Bondsman Guild protocol waiver

226
00:29:55,239 --> 00:29:58,079
compels you to immediately produce
said asset.

227
00:29:58,158 --> 00:29:59,908
IG Unit! Stand down.

228
00:30:04,873 --> 00:30:06,663
I'm in the Guild!

229
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,130
You are a Guild member?

230
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:11,090
I thought I was the only one
on assignment.

231
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:13,049
That makes two of us.

232
00:30:13,715 --> 00:30:15,295
So much for the element of surprise.

233
00:30:15,384 --> 00:30:17,044
Sadly, I must ask for your fob.

234
00:30:17,135 --> 00:30:20,425
I have already issued the writ of seizure.
The bounty is mine.

235
00:30:20,514 --> 00:30:24,094
Unless I'm mistaken,
you are, as of yet, empty-handed.

236
00:30:24,184 --> 00:30:25,394
This is true.

237
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:27,622
- I have a suggestion.
- Proceed.

238
00:30:27,646 --> 00:30:29,126
We split the reward.

239
00:30:29,815 --> 00:30:31,275
This is acceptable.

240
00:30:31,358 --> 00:30:35,318
Great. Now let's regroup,
out of harm's way, and form a plan.

241
00:30:35,404 --> 00:30:38,274
I will of course receive
the reputation merits

242
00:30:38,365 --> 00:30:39,785
associated with the mission.

243
00:30:39,867 --> 00:30:41,447
Can we talk about this later?

244
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:46,000
I require an answer if I am to proceed...

245
00:30:46,081 --> 00:30:48,251
Oh, no. Alert. Alert. Alert.

246
00:30:50,836 --> 00:30:52,956
Oh!

247
00:30:57,384 --> 00:30:59,634
Let's go!

248
00:31:20,532 --> 00:31:21,792
He's in there!

249
00:31:21,867 --> 00:31:22,907
Affirmative.

250
00:31:39,801 --> 00:31:41,141
Up top!

251
00:31:54,483 --> 00:31:55,803
It appears we are trapped.

252
00:31:56,443 --> 00:31:59,363
I will initiate self-destruct sequencing.

253
00:32:00,823 --> 00:32:02,233
Whoa, you're what?

254
00:32:02,324 --> 00:32:05,244
Manufacturers Protocol dictates
I cannot be captured.

255
00:32:05,327 --> 00:32:08,537
- I must self-destruct.
- Do not self-destruct.

256
00:32:09,122 --> 00:32:10,172
Cover me!

257
00:32:28,809 --> 00:32:31,479
Go! Go! Go!
There's too many!

258
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:40,672
They got us pinned.

259
00:32:46,493 --> 00:32:48,283
I will initiate self-destruct.

260
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:51,040
Do not self-destruct!
We're shooting our way out.

261
00:32:55,252 --> 00:32:56,302
Okay.

262
00:32:58,505 --> 00:32:59,545
New plan!

263
00:33:04,178 --> 00:33:05,738
Beginning self-destruct countdown.

264
00:33:05,762 --> 00:33:06,922
No! Stop it!

265
00:33:09,766 --> 00:33:11,806
Draw their fire, I'll take it out.

266
00:33:11,894 --> 00:33:13,394
- Acceptable.
- Go!

267
00:33:45,636 --> 00:33:46,756
Well done.

268
00:33:48,472 --> 00:33:51,022
I will disengage self-destruct initiative.

269
00:33:54,937 --> 00:33:56,697
You know, you're not so bad.

270
00:33:57,397 --> 00:33:59,147
- For a droid.
- Agreed.

271
00:33:59,233 --> 00:34:01,443
That blaster hit looks nasty. You okay?

272
00:34:01,818 --> 00:34:03,658
Running a quick diagnostic.

273
00:34:05,531 --> 00:34:07,491
It has missed my central wiring harness.

274
00:34:07,574 --> 00:34:08,774
Is that good?

275
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:10,331
Yes.

276
00:34:10,661 --> 00:34:13,061
Well,
now we just need to get the door open.

277
00:34:43,443 --> 00:34:44,733
Anyone else?

278
00:34:46,238 --> 00:34:48,198
The tracking fob is still active.

279
00:34:48,282 --> 00:34:51,752
My sensors indicate
that there is a life form present.

280
00:35:24,193 --> 00:35:25,443
Wait.

281
00:35:25,527 --> 00:35:27,237
They said 50 years old.

282
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,030
Species age differently.

283
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:34,500
Perhaps it could live many centuries.

284
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,880
Sadly, we'll never know.

285
00:35:38,957 --> 00:35:40,287
No.

286
00:35:41,627 --> 00:35:43,167
We'll bring it in alive.

287
00:35:43,629 --> 00:35:48,429
The commission was quite specific.
The asset was to be terminated.
