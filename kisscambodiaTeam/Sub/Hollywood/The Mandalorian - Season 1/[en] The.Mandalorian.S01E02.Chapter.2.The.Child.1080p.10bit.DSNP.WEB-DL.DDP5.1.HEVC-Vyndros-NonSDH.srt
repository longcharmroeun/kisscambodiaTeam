1
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:07,307
- What's your highest bounty?
- There is one job.

2
00:00:07,383 --> 00:00:09,923
- Underworld?
- Deep pocket.

3
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:13,011
Greef Karga said you were the best
in the parsec.

4
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:18,777
I have a camtono of Beskar waiting for you
upon delivery of the asset.

5
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:22,942
You are Mandalorian!

6
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:24,771
I will help you.

7
00:00:25,318 --> 00:00:27,028
Many have passed through.

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,570
They seek the same one.

9
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:32,704
IG Unit! Stand down.

10
00:00:32,784 --> 00:00:34,244
You are a Guild member?

11
00:00:34,327 --> 00:00:36,305
I have a suggestion.
We split the reward.

12
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:37,619
This is acceptable.

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,410
The tracking fob is still active.

14
00:00:42,669 --> 00:00:43,919
There is a life form present.

15
00:11:11,172 --> 00:11:13,002
I thought you were dead.

16
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:34,071
This is what was causing all the fuss?

17
00:11:34,946 --> 00:11:36,696
I think it's a child.

18
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:39,281
It is better to deliver it alive then.

19
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:42,831
My ship
has been destroyed. I'm trapped here.

20
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:45,492
Stripped. Not destroyed.

21
00:11:46,249 --> 00:11:50,579
The Jawas steal. They don't destroy.

22
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:53,960
Stolen or destroyed,
makes no difference to me.

23
00:11:56,384 --> 00:11:58,674
They're protected
by their crawling fortress.

24
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:01,301
There's no way to recover the parts.

25
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:02,849
You can trade.

26
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:05,392
With Jawas?
Are you out of your mind?

27
00:12:05,476 --> 00:12:06,936
I will take you to them.

28
00:12:07,687 --> 00:12:08,937
I have spoken.

29
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:14,235
Hey! Spit that out.

30
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,160
They really don't like you
for some reason.

31
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,040
Well, I did disintegrate a few of them.

32
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:22,424
You need to drop your rifle.

33
00:13:22,512 --> 00:13:25,592
I'm a Mandalorian.
Weapons are part of my religion.

34
00:13:25,682 --> 00:13:27,852
Then you are not getting your parts back.

35
00:13:31,563 --> 00:13:32,563
Fine.

36
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:44,821
And the blaster.

37
00:13:49,706 --> 00:13:50,706
Good day.

38
00:14:16,191 --> 00:14:18,611
They will trade all the parts
for the beskar.

39
00:14:18,693 --> 00:14:21,153
I'm not gonna trade anything.
These are my parts.

40
00:14:21,237 --> 00:14:22,537
They stole them from me.

41
00:14:31,623 --> 00:14:33,373
- You understand this?
- No!

42
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:36,218
Whoa. Easy, easy.

43
00:14:46,596 --> 00:14:48,556
Get away from it!

44
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:05,993
The egg? What egg?

45
00:22:12,876 --> 00:22:14,126
Mando!

46
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:18,211
I have it.

47
00:22:18,298 --> 00:22:19,508
I've got the egg.

48
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:13,059
I'm surprised you waited.

49
00:23:13,853 --> 00:23:16,643
I'm surprised you took so long.

50
00:23:33,998 --> 00:23:36,128
Is it still sleeping?

51
00:23:39,003 --> 00:23:40,173
Yes.

52
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,134
Was it injured?

53
00:23:46,219 --> 00:23:49,549
I don't think so.
Not physically.

54
00:23:50,557 --> 00:23:52,357
Explain it to me again.

55
00:23:53,142 --> 00:23:55,852
I still don't understand what happened.

56
00:23:57,105 --> 00:23:58,605
Neither do I.

57
00:24:06,322 --> 00:24:09,912
There's no way we're gonna get this to
work without a full maintenance facility.

58
00:24:10,326 --> 00:24:11,956
This is gonna take days to fix.

59
00:24:12,579 --> 00:24:15,329
If you care to help, it might go faster.

60
00:24:18,668 --> 00:24:20,678
There is much work to do.

61
00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:30,949
I can't thank you enough.

62
00:25:31,032 --> 00:25:33,202
Please allow me to give you
a portion of the reward.

63
00:25:34,077 --> 00:25:35,917
I cannot accept.

64
00:25:35,995 --> 00:25:40,205
You are my guest
and I am therefore in your service.

65
00:25:43,962 --> 00:25:48,302
I could use a crew member of your ability,
and I can pay handsomely.

66
00:25:49,634 --> 00:25:50,764
I am honored,

67
00:25:50,844 --> 00:25:55,224
but I have worked a lifetime
to finally be free of servitude.

68
00:25:55,306 --> 00:25:59,016
I understand.
Then all I can offer is my thanks.

69
00:25:59,102 --> 00:26:00,602
And I offer mine.

70
00:26:00,979 --> 00:26:03,599
Thank you for bringing peace to my valley.

71
00:26:18,913 --> 00:26:21,373
And good luck with The Child.

72
00:26:21,457 --> 00:26:24,757
May it survive and bring you
a handsome reward.

73
00:26:26,504 --> 00:26:27,674
I have spoken.
