1
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:09,351
Such a large bounty

2
00:00:09,434 --> 00:00:11,944
for such a small package.

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,360
My armor has lost
its integrity. I may need to begin again.

4
00:00:15,941 --> 00:00:19,281
I must warn you.
It will draw many eyes.

5
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:21,321
They all hate you, Mando.

6
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:27,161
Now, how can I show my gratitude
to my most valuable partner?

7
00:00:27,244 --> 00:00:28,471
What are they doing with it?

8
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:31,125
I didn't ask.
It's against the Guild Code.

9
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,880
Step aside.
I'm going to my ship.

10
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:47,309
You put the bounty down
and perhaps I'll let you pass.

11
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:53,955
How many of them had tracking fobs?

12
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:56,359
All of them. All of them!

13
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,700
I'm gonna get you.

14
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:15,021
Oh.

15
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,240
- Go, go, go!
- They're back!

16
00:02:31,326 --> 00:02:32,906
- Go!
- Run for cover.

17
00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:34,335
- Get inside!
- Mama!

18
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:37,123
Mama!

19
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:40,629
Mama! MAN 3: Go!

20
00:02:43,755 --> 00:02:45,385
- Mama!
- Winta!

21
00:02:45,924 --> 00:02:46,924
Mama!

22
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:55,985
Come on.

23
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:43,709
Stop touching things.

24
00:05:01,476 --> 00:05:03,636
Let's see. Sorgan.

25
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:07,269
Looks like there's no star port,
no industrial centers,

26
00:05:07,357 --> 00:05:09,147
no population density.

27
00:05:09,234 --> 00:05:10,994
Real backwater skug hole.

28
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:12,399
Which means it's perfect for us.

29
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:15,696
You ready to lay low and stretch your legs
for a couple of months,

30
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,242
you little womp rat?

31
00:05:17,326 --> 00:05:19,036
Nobody's gonna find us here.

32
00:05:57,407 --> 00:05:59,969
Listen. I'm gonna go
out there and I'm gonna look around.

33
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:01,543
It shouldn't take too long.

34
00:06:03,622 --> 00:06:06,622
Now, don't touch anything.

35
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:09,838
I'll find us some lodging,
then I'll come back for you.

36
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,420
You stay right here.

37
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:14,296
You stay. Don't move.

38
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,631
You understand?

39
00:06:17,135 --> 00:06:18,185
Great.

40
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,400
Oh, what the hell? Come on.

41
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:47,348
Welcome, travelers.
Can I interest you in anything?

42
00:07:47,893 --> 00:07:49,773
Bone broth, for the little one.

43
00:07:49,811 --> 00:07:53,191
Oh, well, you're in luck. I just took down
a grinjer, so there's plenty.

44
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,863
Can I interest you
in a porringer of broth as well?

45
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:57,670
- Just the one.
- Very well.

46
00:07:57,694 --> 00:08:00,404
That one over there.
When did she arrive?

47
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:04,871
I've seen her here
for the last week or so.

48
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:06,912
- What's her business here?
- Business?

49
00:08:06,995 --> 00:08:11,715
Oh, well, there's not much business
in Sorgan, so I can't say.

50
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:16,172
She doesn't strike me as a log runner.
Well, thank you, sir.

51
00:08:16,254 --> 00:08:19,384
I will get that broth to you
as soon as possible,

52
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:24,596
and I will throw in a flagon of spotchka
just for good measure.

53
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,430
I will be right back with that.

54
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,581
Keep an eye on the kid.

55
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:34,945
Yes, sir.

56
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,999
You want some soup?

57
00:09:55,187 --> 00:09:58,057
Saw most of my action
mopping up after Endor.

58
00:09:58,148 --> 00:09:59,858
Mostly Ex-Imperial Warlords.

59
00:10:00,525 --> 00:10:03,445
They wanted it fast and quiet.
They'd send us in on the drop ships.

60
00:10:03,528 --> 00:10:05,278
No support, just us.

61
00:10:05,948 --> 00:10:08,068
Then when the Imps were gone,
the politics started.

62
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:12,449
We were peacekeepers,
protecting delegates, suppressing riots.

63
00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:13,787
Not what I signed up for.

64
00:10:14,665 --> 00:10:16,225
How'd you end up here?

65
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,215
Let's just call it an early retirement.

66
00:10:22,297 --> 00:10:23,547
Look, I knew you were Guild.

67
00:10:23,632 --> 00:10:26,552
I figured you had a fob on me.
That's why I came at you so hard.

68
00:10:27,052 --> 00:10:28,812
Yeah, that's what I figured.

69
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,969
Well, this has been a real treat,

70
00:10:31,056 --> 00:10:33,056
but unless you wanna go another round,

71
00:10:33,141 --> 00:10:36,141
one of us is gonna have to move on,
and I was here first.

72
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,990
Well, looks like this planet's taken.

73
00:11:17,728 --> 00:11:19,018
Excuse me.

74
00:11:20,063 --> 00:11:21,063
Excuse me, sir.

75
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:23,228
There something I can help you with?

76
00:11:23,692 --> 00:11:24,982
Uh, yeah.

77
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:26,986
Raiders.

78
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,110
We have money.

79
00:11:28,196 --> 00:11:30,396
So, you think I'm some kinda mercenary?

80
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:32,827
You are a Mandalorian, right?

81
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:36,499
Or at least wearing Mandalorian armor.
That is Mandalorian armor, right?

82
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:39,667
- It is.
- See? I told him.

83
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,590
Sir, I've read a lot about
your people... Tribe.

84
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,749
- If half of what I read is true...
- We have money.

85
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:47,588
- How much?
- Everything we have, sir.

86
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:50,594
- Our whole harvest was stolen.
- Krill. We're krill farmers.

87
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:53,507
We brew spotchka.
Our whole village chipped in.

88
00:11:55,474 --> 00:11:56,743
It's not enough.

89
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:58,937
Are you sure?
You don't even know what the job is.

90
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,747
I know it's not enough. Good luck.

91
00:12:00,771 --> 00:12:01,981
This is everything we have.

92
00:12:02,064 --> 00:12:04,074
We'll give you more
after the next harvest.

93
00:12:11,573 --> 00:12:13,823
Come on. Let's head back.

94
00:12:15,786 --> 00:12:17,866
Took us the whole day to get here.

95
00:12:17,955 --> 00:12:20,415
Now we have to ride back
with no protection

96
00:12:20,499 --> 00:12:21,749
to the middle of nowhere.

97
00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:23,901
Where do you live?

98
00:12:24,753 --> 00:12:27,213
On a farm. Weren't you listening?

99
00:12:27,297 --> 00:12:28,297
We're farmers.

100
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,729
In the middle of nowhere?

101
00:12:31,635 --> 00:12:32,645
Yes.

102
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,830
You have lodging?

103
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,355
Yeah. Absolutely.

104
00:12:37,432 --> 00:12:39,182
Good. Come up and help.

105
00:12:50,362 --> 00:12:52,362
I'm gonna need one more thing.

106
00:12:52,447 --> 00:12:54,487
Give me those credits.

107
00:13:00,497 --> 00:13:01,907
Ready for round two?

108
00:13:06,169 --> 00:13:09,049
So, we're basically running off
a band of Raiders for lunch money?

109
00:13:09,131 --> 00:13:11,609
They're quartering us
in the middle of nowhere.

110
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:13,383
Last I checked,
that's a pretty square deal

111
00:13:13,468 --> 00:13:14,838
for somebody in your position.

112
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,798
Worst case scenario,
you tune up your blaster.

113
00:13:16,888 --> 00:13:19,218
Best case, we're a deterrent.

114
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:22,065
I can't imagine there's anything
living in these trees

115
00:13:22,144 --> 00:13:24,564
that an ex-shock trooper couldn't handle.

116
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:48,133
Everyone, they're here!

117
00:13:50,213 --> 00:13:51,213
Come on.

118
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:57,348
Well, looks like they're happy to see us.

119
00:13:57,429 --> 00:13:59,009
Looks like.

120
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:01,467
- Hi.
- He's so cute.

121
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:03,058
Aw!

122
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,208
Please come in.

123
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:32,465
I hope this is comfortable for you.

124
00:14:33,548 --> 00:14:35,298
Sorry that all we have is the barn.

125
00:14:35,926 --> 00:14:37,326
This will do fine.

126
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:41,176
I stacked some blankets over here.

127
00:14:41,974 --> 00:14:44,644
Thank you. That's very kind.

128
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:58,156
This is my daughter, Winta.

129
00:14:59,157 --> 00:15:01,907
We don't get a lot of visitors
around here.

130
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:04,291
She's not used to strangers.

131
00:15:06,248 --> 00:15:10,128
This nice man is going to help
protect us from the bad ones.

132
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:11,919
Thank you.

133
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:19,719
Come on, Winta.
Let's give our guests some room.

134
00:15:33,942 --> 00:15:36,692
- Knock, knock.
- Come in.

135
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:55,554
Can I feed him?

136
00:15:57,633 --> 00:15:58,723
Sure.

137
00:16:05,307 --> 00:16:06,637
Are you hungry?

138
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:14,073
Can I play with him?

139
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:17,819
Sure.

140
00:16:24,952 --> 00:16:26,622
Come on.

141
00:16:28,705 --> 00:16:30,475
- I don't think...
- They'll be fine.

142
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:32,209
- I don't...
- They'll be fine.

143
00:16:34,711 --> 00:16:36,551
I brought you some food.

144
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,420
I noticed you didn't eat out there.

145
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:40,882
I'll leave it here for when I go.

146
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:43,515
That's very thoughtful of you.

147
00:16:48,183 --> 00:16:50,143
Do you mind if ask you something?

148
00:16:50,227 --> 00:16:51,437
Go ahead.

149
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,480
How long has it been
since you've taken that off?

150
00:16:57,734 --> 00:16:58,864
Yesterday.

151
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:03,698
I mean, in front of someone else.

152
00:17:10,455 --> 00:17:12,835
I wasn't much older than they are.

153
00:17:17,462 --> 00:17:20,762
You haven't shown your face to anyone
since you were a kid?

154
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:25,723
No. I was happy that they took me in.

155
00:17:26,305 --> 00:17:30,025
My parents were killed
and the Mandalorians took care of me.

156
00:17:31,643 --> 00:17:32,643
I'm sorry.

157
00:17:33,562 --> 00:17:34,902
This is the Way.

158
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:41,319
Let us know if there's anything you need.

159
00:17:42,404 --> 00:17:43,614
Thank you.

160
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,820
About 15 or 20 of them
came through here on foot.

161
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,910
And something big
sheared off those branches.

162
00:18:48,136 --> 00:18:50,046
AT-ST.

163
00:18:50,138 --> 00:18:53,678
Imperial walker.
What's it doing here?

164
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:55,137
I don't know.

165
00:18:57,646 --> 00:18:59,896
But this is more than I signed up for.

166
00:19:04,278 --> 00:19:06,988
Bad news.
You can't live here anymore.

167
00:19:07,072 --> 00:19:08,662
- What?
- Why?

168
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:11,076
Nice bedside manner.

169
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:13,159
You think you can do better?

170
00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:14,835
Can't do much worse.

171
00:19:16,331 --> 00:19:18,581
I know this is not the news
you wanted to hear,

172
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:20,037
but there are no other options.

173
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:21,837
- You took the job.
- Yeah.

174
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,210
That was before we knew about the AT-ST.

175
00:19:24,923 --> 00:19:26,013
What is that?

176
00:19:26,091 --> 00:19:29,681
The armored walker with two enormous guns
that you knew about and didn't tell us.

177
00:19:29,761 --> 00:19:30,989
- Help us.
- Please.

178
00:19:31,013 --> 00:19:33,157
- You're supposed to help us.
- But we hired you.

179
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:35,641
- Please.
- We have nowhere to go.

180
00:19:35,726 --> 00:19:38,136
Sure you do. This is a big planet.

181
00:19:38,687 --> 00:19:42,517
- I mean, I've seen a lot smaller.
- My grandparents seeded these ponds.

182
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:44,048
- It took generations.
- Yeah.

183
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:47,991
I understand. I do.
But there are only two of us.

184
00:19:48,614 --> 00:19:50,704
No, there's not. There's at least 20 here.

185
00:19:50,782 --> 00:19:53,782
- Yeah.
- I mean fighters. Be realistic.

186
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:55,229
- We can learn.
- We can.

187
00:19:55,287 --> 00:19:56,807
- Give us a chance.
- Please.

188
00:19:57,205 --> 00:20:00,125
I've seen that thing take out
entire companies of soldiers

189
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,498
in a matter of minutes.

190
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,960
We're not leaving.

191
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:10,805
You cannot fight that thing.

192
00:20:12,804 --> 00:20:15,354
Unless we show them how.

193
00:20:15,432 --> 00:20:16,432
Show us.

194
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:18,306
Yeah, we can do this.

195
00:20:19,937 --> 00:20:21,617
You got two problems here.

196
00:20:21,647 --> 00:20:23,557
You got the bandits, and you got the mech.

197
00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:24,939
We'll handle the AT-ST,

198
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:27,695
but you got to protect us
when they come out of the woods.

199
00:20:27,778 --> 00:20:29,988
And I don't have to tell you
how dangerous they are.

200
00:20:30,614 --> 00:20:32,414
Cara Dune here was a veteran.

201
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:34,581
She was a drop soldier for the Rebellion,

202
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,540
and she's gonna lay out a plan for you,
so listen carefully.

203
00:20:38,205 --> 00:20:41,545
Now, there's nothing on this planet
that can damage the legs on this thing,

204
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,135
so we're gonna build a trap.

205
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,050
We're gonna need to dig
real deep, right here,

206
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:48,879
so that when it steps in, it drops.

207
00:20:49,591 --> 00:20:52,471
The two of us will hit their camp.
Provoke them.

208
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:55,352
That'll bring the fight out of the woods
and down here to us.

209
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,991
I'm gonna need you to cut down trees

210
00:20:57,015 --> 00:20:59,565
and build barricades along these edges.

211
00:21:00,686 --> 00:21:03,146
I need it high enough
so that they can't get over,

212
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,020
and strong enough
so that it can't break through.

213
00:21:07,317 --> 00:21:10,777
Okay. Who knows how to shoot?

214
00:21:25,836 --> 00:21:28,496
Ready, one. Move your leg out.

215
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:29,588
Get ready.

216
00:21:30,882 --> 00:21:31,882
One.

217
00:21:40,267 --> 00:21:41,267
One.

218
00:21:42,394 --> 00:21:44,524
- Get into it. One.
- Fire.

219
00:21:55,574 --> 00:21:57,034
One.

220
00:21:57,117 --> 00:21:58,407
Two.

221
00:21:58,493 --> 00:21:59,703
Three.

222
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:01,076
Four.

223
00:22:01,163 --> 00:22:02,163
Reset.

224
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:03,789
Louder.

225
00:22:03,874 --> 00:22:05,174
One.

226
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,380
Two.

227
00:22:13,342 --> 00:22:16,052
The sun is about to set,
and we'll be leaving soon.

228
00:22:16,637 --> 00:22:18,637
When we return, we're coming in hot.

229
00:22:19,973 --> 00:22:21,223
We'll be ready.

230
00:24:32,898 --> 00:24:34,538
Come on. I'll cover you.

231
00:24:46,036 --> 00:24:47,786
I hope the plan worked.

232
00:24:59,341 --> 00:25:01,181
Go. Go!

233
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,079
It's okay.

234
00:25:37,587 --> 00:25:42,297
This is it. Once that thing steps
into the pond, it's goin' down.

235
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:51,809
Weapons ready.

236
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,430
Just a few more steps.

237
00:26:21,089 --> 00:26:22,169
It stopped.

238
00:26:30,849 --> 00:26:32,809
Get down. Get down.

239
00:26:49,826 --> 00:26:51,286
Caben. Stay there.

240
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,200
Hold your positions.

241
00:27:02,673 --> 00:27:04,383
Open fire.

242
00:27:21,483 --> 00:27:23,503
We got to get that thing to step forward.

243
00:27:23,527 --> 00:27:24,527
I'm thinking.

244
00:27:24,611 --> 00:27:25,781
Stay back, stay back!

245
00:27:34,913 --> 00:27:35,963
New plan.

246
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,600
What do you have in mind?

247
00:27:37,624 --> 00:27:39,174
Give me the pulse rifle.

248
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:42,199
I'll cover you.

249
00:27:54,349 --> 00:27:55,889
Come on, you got this.

250
00:27:58,103 --> 00:27:59,353
Come to Mama.

251
00:28:13,827 --> 00:28:15,327
This is it. It's now or never.

252
00:28:15,996 --> 00:28:17,456
Go.

253
00:28:23,003 --> 00:28:25,253
Caben, Stoke, get out there.

254
00:28:46,026 --> 00:28:47,946
Take the bait, you hunk of junk.

255
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,760
Was that the plan?

256
00:29:51,508 --> 00:29:53,378
Somethin' like that.

257
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:14,029
Ew!

258
00:30:29,921 --> 00:30:31,881
Thank you.

259
00:30:31,965 --> 00:30:33,555
Can I set you something in the house?

260
00:30:33,634 --> 00:30:35,724
Uh, thank you. Maybe later.

261
00:30:38,889 --> 00:30:40,469
He's very happy here.

262
00:30:41,516 --> 00:30:42,676
He is.

263
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:46,559
Fits right in.

264
00:30:53,403 --> 00:30:56,363
So, what happens
if you take that thing off?

265
00:30:56,448 --> 00:30:58,118
They come after you and kill you?

266
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,660
No. You just can't ever
put it back on again.

267
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:07,211
That's it?

268
00:31:08,752 --> 00:31:10,462
So you can slip off the helmet,

269
00:31:10,545 --> 00:31:13,055
and settle down
with that beautiful young widow,

270
00:31:13,131 --> 00:31:15,881
and raise your kid sitting here,
sipping spotchka?

271
00:31:20,973 --> 00:31:23,933
You know, we raised
some hell here a few weeks back.

272
00:31:24,017 --> 00:31:26,977
It's too much action
for a backwater town like this.

273
00:31:28,021 --> 00:31:29,441
Word travels fast.

274
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,649
We might wanna cycle the charts
and move on.

275
00:31:34,069 --> 00:31:36,739
Would not wanna be the one
who's got to tell him.

276
00:31:40,784 --> 00:31:42,334
I'm leaving him here.

277
00:31:45,372 --> 00:31:49,132
Traveling with me,
that's no life for a kid.

278
00:31:50,085 --> 00:31:53,385
I did my job, he's safe.
Better chance at a life.

279
00:31:54,256 --> 00:31:56,756
Come on. Come on.

280
00:31:58,343 --> 00:32:00,643
It's gonna break his little heart.

281
00:32:01,972 --> 00:32:04,932
He'll get over it. We all do.

282
00:32:28,373 --> 00:32:32,173
Excuse me.
Can I have a word?

283
00:32:32,252 --> 00:32:33,502
Of course.

284
00:32:43,931 --> 00:32:45,771
It's very nice here.

285
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,140
Yes.

286
00:32:48,727 --> 00:32:51,937
I think
it's clear he's... He's happy here.

287
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,190
What about you?

288
00:32:54,983 --> 00:32:55,983
Me?

289
00:32:56,985 --> 00:32:58,365
Are you happy here?

290
00:33:01,156 --> 00:33:03,026
We want you to stay.

291
00:33:04,242 --> 00:33:05,912
The community's grateful.

292
00:33:05,994 --> 00:33:09,044
You can pack all this away
in case there's ever trouble.

293
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:13,916
You and your boy could have a good life.

294
00:33:15,587 --> 00:33:17,837
He could be a child for a while.

295
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,379
Wouldn't that be nice?

296
00:33:25,305 --> 00:33:26,435
It would.

297
00:33:41,321 --> 00:33:43,281
I don't belong here.

298
00:33:44,157 --> 00:33:45,447
But he does.

299
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,620
I understand.

300
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:55,836
I will look after him as one of my own.

301
00:34:11,727 --> 00:34:13,047
Go get the kids.

302
00:34:30,704 --> 00:34:32,754
Who's he tracking?

303
00:34:32,831 --> 00:34:34,211
The kid.

304
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,580
They know he's here.

305
00:34:37,419 --> 00:34:39,169
Yes.

306
00:34:39,254 --> 00:34:41,094
Then they'll keep coming.

307
00:34:42,382 --> 00:34:43,722
Yes.

308
00:34:59,149 --> 00:35:01,319
Are you sure you don't want an escort?

309
00:35:02,027 --> 00:35:03,687
I appreciate the offer,

310
00:35:05,864 --> 00:35:08,994
but we're gonna bypass the town
and head right to the Razor Crest.

311
00:35:09,701 --> 00:35:13,371
Well then, until our paths cross.

312
00:35:15,165 --> 00:35:16,725
Until our paths cross.

313
00:35:24,883 --> 00:35:27,093
I'm gonna miss you so much.

314
00:35:34,893 --> 00:35:36,023
Thank you.
