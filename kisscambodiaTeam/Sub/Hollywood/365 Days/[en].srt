<i>In the first batch,</i>

3
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,458
<i>we've got 20 refugees.</i>

4
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,166
<i>All young girls.</i>

5
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,875
<i>Feel free to keep one.</i>

6
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,333
<i>I'm afraid you've got the wrong address.</i>

7
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,666
<i>But the merchandise is excellent.
A real bargain.</i>

8
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,916
<i>Some of them are barely 12.</i>

9
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:26,541
<i>It's a lot of money.</i>

10
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,958
<i>All you need to do
is to help us get them here.</i>

11
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,125
<i>My family has never been
into this sort of business.</i>

12
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,500
<i>I don't have to do anything.</i>

13
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,666

14
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:44,125
<i>I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.</i>

15

16
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,833

<i>Fucking assholes.</i>

19
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,958
<i>However,
he's a potential business partner.</i>

20
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:20,375
<i>He deserves our respect.</i>

21

<i>How the fuck...</i>

62
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:31,833

64
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,666

<i>This conversation is over.</i>

68
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,166
<i>- This is America.</i>

69
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,166
<i>Ms. Biel?</i>

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,416
<i>- First of all, it's not my fault.
- Listen, ma'am...</i>

71
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,375
<i>I haven't finished yet.</i>

72
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,416
<i>And it's not my job
to temper rowdy customers.</i>

73
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,291
<i>And I think you should rather tell us</i>

74
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,750

75

<i>What is it?</i>

78
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,250
<i>You have this game in America, right?</i>

79
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:25,750
<i>Trick or treat.</i>

80
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:30,375

81
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:35,000

we are in media from the US to Japan.</i>

82
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,666
<i>I thought that when it comes

about that?</i>

86

<i>Shall I continue?</i>

88
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,916
<i>You've embarrassed us

89
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,458
<i>We all know how the media
and the stock market will react</i>

90

<i>when I make it all public.</i>

91
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,875
<i>There have been so many reservations</i>

92
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,625

<i>After a week...</i>

00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,708
<i>bank shares will fall by half.</i>

95
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,208
<i>It was possible because of my strategy.</i>

96
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,375

<i>you're coming back to Poland,
moving out...</i>

289

<i>disappearing from his life.</i>

290
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:15,000
<i>You know what?</i>

291
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:16,958
<i>Fuck off.</i>

292
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,750
<i>I won't do anything
without your permission.</i>

293
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:38,750

295
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:45,666
<i>I won't tie you up,</i>

296
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,291
<i>but don't provoke me.</i>

297
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:48,750
<i>I can't be gentle.</i>

298
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:52,208
<i>I'm not used to tolerating disobedience.</i>

299
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,833
<i>You have 365 days.</i>

300
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:12,166

304
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,500
<i>or this will be stop being funny.</i>

305
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:44,916
<i>Do you really wanna kill me?</i>

306
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:47,708

you'd be off the hook now.</i>

323
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:04,291
<i>But you decided to sell children
to a brothel.</i>

324
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:11,208
<i>Did you think I wouldn't find out?</i>

325

- Shut up.</i>

00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:21,541
<i>What family?</i>

328
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:23,166
<i>What values?</i>

329
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:25,916
<i>Spare me this bullshit, and shoot me.</i>

330
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:36,000
<i>You will be erased.</i>

331
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,291
<i>No trace will be left of you...</i>

332
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,541

333
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:45,666
<i>That's your punishment.</i>

334
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:30,500

335
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:32,166

338
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,875
<i>You shouldn't have seen it.</i>

339
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:03,500
<i>But you have to know that he deserved it.</i>

340
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:06,125
<i>He had been hurting children.</i>

341
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:08,625
<i>Cheating and stealing on his family.</i>

342
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:10,291
<i>We don't forgive it.</i>

343
00:31:11,708 --> 00:31:13,875
<i>He killed himself
with what he'd been doing.</i>

344
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:22,291
<i>It wasn't me who changed your clothes.
It was the maid.</i>

345
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,833
<i>You have people for everything.</i>

346

of being a boss.</i>

347
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:40,875
<i>So, tell one of your butlers

<i>I can see you've got your strength back.</i>

349

364
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,708
<i>What? You will kill me?</i>

365

823

824
01:17:00,458 --> 01:17:01,458

916
01:24:45,791 --> 01:24:47,791
<i>- We have to think this through.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

917
01:24:50,083 --> 01:24:52,875
<i>He comes from a rich,

918
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,916
<i>They don't take foreigners for wives.</i>

923
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,875
<i>And the worst thing
is that they keep me in the dark.</i>

<i>They treat me like some kind of doll.</i>

925

<i>They sent me to Poland,
and I still don't know a single thing.</i>

926
01:25:38,083 --> 01:25:41,000
<i>That's why you need to fucking back out.
Do you understand?</i>

927
01:25:41,083 --> 01:25:44,250
<i>Fuck all the Massimos, Martins,
and all the other mozzarellas.</i>

928
01:25:47,333 --> 01:25:48,541
<i>It's time for a change.</i>

929
01:25:50,875 --> 01:25:51,958
<i>A change of undies.</i>

930
01:25:52,291 --> 01:25:53,666

<i>I started looking for you.
It got dark, so I went back to the hotel.</i>

- So, it was all fake?</i>

1002
01:30:45,541 --> 01:30:46,708
<i>There was nothing between us?</i>

1003

<i>It wasn't fake,
but it wasn't a healthy relationship.</i>

1004

<i>- Honey, let's talk.
- We have nothing to talk about!</i>

1005
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:53,083
<i>- Don't you get it? Nothing!
- We do.</i>

1006
01:30:53,166 --> 01:30:55,375
<i>No! You have already told me
what you had to say.</i>

1007
01:30:55,458 --> 01:30:57,125
<i>No, leave me alone!</i>

what you two are saying,</i>

1011
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:06,250
<i>but it's rather clear
that she wants you to leave.</i>

1012
01:31:07,875 --> 01:31:09,958
<i>Do I have to say it so you'll understand?</i>

1013
