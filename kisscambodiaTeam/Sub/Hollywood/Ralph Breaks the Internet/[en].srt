1
00:00:03,167 --> 00:00:48,167
watch on kisskh.me

2
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:53,551
Okay. My turn, my turn.
Um, I got one.

3
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,887
Great, but can you make it

4
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:56,421
a little more challenging
this time?

5
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:59,457
Okay. Check this out.

6
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:03,394
I spy with my little eye...

7
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,865
something yellow...

8
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:11,269
and round,
and it eats dots.

9
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,706
Seriously, Ralph?

10
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:16,240
Yeah, seriously.
You're never gonna get it.

11
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,677
Well, obviously,
it's Pac-Man.

12
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,244
No, that's not...

13
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,680
Why is that obvious?

14
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,549
Name one other thing
in this whole arcade

15
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:25,884
that is yellow and round
and eats dots.

16
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:27,385
I can name two things.

17
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:28,587
Ms. Pac-Man
and Baby Pac-Man.

18
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,556
Boom!
I accept your apology.

19
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:33,759
Yeah, you're right. Okay.
But was it Pac-Man?

20
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,661
Yeah, you got me.

21
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:38,697
Knew it.
All right, riddle me this...

22
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:42,401
do you or do you not think
that Zangief waxes?

23
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:44,335
No way. Look at the guy.
He looks like a yeti.

24
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:45,704
I don't know.

25
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,740
I mean, if the fur
were confined to his chest,

26
00:01:47,742 --> 00:01:48,907
I might agree...

27
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:50,442
but look at those
two very specific

28
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,877
tuffets of shin hair...

29
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,412
poking out of his boots.

30
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:56,448
That does not just happen,
Ralph. That is a choice.

31
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,417
You're totally right, kid.

32
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:00,719
He's baby smooth
everywhere else.

33
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,721
I rest my case.

34
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:05,391
My mind is blown!

35
00:02:05,393 --> 00:02:06,792
Let's go get a root beer.

36
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:09,962
Okay, let's see
what you got, kid.

37
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,630
Ooh!

38
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,632
Nice one. Okay.

39
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,367
I think I got one
in the chamber.

40
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:18,404
Ew!

41
00:02:18,406 --> 00:02:20,339
- Gross.
- Thank you.

42
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:21,607
Hey, wanna sneak into <i>Tron?</i>

43
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:23,442
Doesn't that game
have a virus?

44
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:25,911
No. I'm sure
they fixed it.

45
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:27,780
Whoo!

46
00:02:27,782 --> 00:02:30,249
I'm gonna beat
my speed record!

47
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:31,752
Hey, wait for me!

48
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:41,927
Ralph.

49
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:43,462
Yeah?

50
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:45,633
I don't think
they fixed the game.

51
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,702
Uh... No.

52
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:49,704
Help!

53
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:51,972
Hey, Tron!

54
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:53,774
Tronny!

55
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:56,510
Tronny boy!

56
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,512
Help!

57
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,846
Do you realize

58
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,549
we're basically just, like,
zeroes and ones...

59
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:07,319
floating around the universe
like tiny specks of dust?

60
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:08,687
Like, doesn't the very nature

61
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,456
of our existence
make you wonder...

62
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,791
if there's more to life
than this?

63
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,660
Why would I wonder
if there's more to life

64
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:16,895
when the life
I got is perfect?

65
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:19,531
I mean, sure. Doesn't
look so hot on paper.

66
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,500
<i>I'm just a bad guy
from some old video game</i>

67
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:22,668
<i>who wrecks a building.</i>

68
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,303
<i>And yeah, for 27 years,</i>

69
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:26,605
<i>I was a total zero
without any friends.</i>

70
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:28,674
But now,
I got a best friend...

71
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:29,942
who just happens to be

72
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:31,810
the coolest kid
in the whole arcade.

73
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,812
Aw, thanks, pal.

74
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:34,815
Watch this.

75
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:38,985
Home run!

76
00:03:38,987 --> 00:03:40,521
All right, let's go
watch the sunrise.

77
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,888
Are you really saying

78
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,991
there's not one single,
solitary thing...

79
00:03:44,993 --> 00:03:47,060
about your life
that you would change?

80
00:03:47,062 --> 00:03:49,062
Well, think about it.

81
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:51,998
You and me get to
goof off all night long.

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,633
Litwak shows up, we go to
work, we put in our hours.

83
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,002
Then the arcade closes

84
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:58,004
and we get to do it
all over again.

85
00:03:58,006 --> 00:04:00,706
The only thing I might do
different in that scenario...

86
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,741
would be not having
to go to work.

87
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,544
Other than that,
I wouldn't change a thing.

88
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:06,745
Huh?

89
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,983
Hey, where'd our sunrise go?

90
00:04:09,985 --> 00:04:12,020
All right,
let's get you plugged in.

91
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:15,922
That's a plug-in alert.

92
00:04:15,924 --> 00:04:18,423
Litwak hasn't plugged in
a new game in forever.

93
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,592
- Let's go see what it is!
- Yeah!

94
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,694
Excuse us. Excuse us.
Minor emergency.

95
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,931
Hey, Felix, Calhoun,
what's getting plugged in?

96
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:26,565
Well, Ralph, Sonic thinks

97
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:28,634
it's gonna be
a new pinball machine.

98
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:30,136
What do you think,
lady love?

99
00:04:30,138 --> 00:04:33,773
I'll bet you a shiny nickel
it's a blood pressure machine.

100
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:35,875
- Kids love those things.
- Ooh.

101
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:39,611
Please be a racing game.
Please be a racing game.

102
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,448
Please be a racing game.

103
00:04:43,852 --> 00:04:46,552
"Whiffee"? Or, "Wifey"?

104
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:49,823
Well, it's either wiffle ball,
or an arranged marriage game.

105
00:04:49,825 --> 00:04:51,557
It's actually pronounced
"Wi-Fi," Ralph.

106
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:52,725
Yeah, that's what I said.

107
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:54,459
And Wi-Fi is the Internet...

108
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,728
which is an online community

109
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,896
where human beings
go to shop...

110
00:04:56,898 --> 00:04:58,731
and play games and socialize.

111
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:00,499
Ooh, fun!

112
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:01,901
Oh, no, it is not.

113
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:04,137
That sign right there
says "Wi-Fi."

114
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,606
What it should say
is "Die-Fi."

115
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,844
That's a little humor there.

116
00:05:10,846 --> 00:05:12,946
But seriously, the Internet
is nothing to laugh at.

117
00:05:12,948 --> 00:05:14,714
It is new, it is different,

118
00:05:14,716 --> 00:05:16,149
and therefore
we should fear it.

119
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:18,551
So keep out, for Pete's sake,
and get to work.

120
00:05:18,553 --> 00:05:20,653
The arcade's about to open.

121
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:23,523
Figures, we finally get
something new plugged in...

122
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:25,457
and we're not even allowed
to go in there.

123
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,426
Totally not fair.

124
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:29,996
A new racing game
would've been cool.

125
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:31,030
Something wrong
with your game?

126
00:05:31,032 --> 00:05:32,599
No, no.

127
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:35,001
It's just every bonus level's
been unlocked.

128
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:37,003
I know every shortcut.

129
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:39,772
Man, I'd kill for even
just a new track.

130
00:05:39,774 --> 00:05:42,675
New track? You already got,
like, three choices.

131
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:44,010
Yeah, I know,
but don't you ever wish

132
00:05:44,012 --> 00:05:45,445
something new
and different...

133
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:46,779
would happen in your game?

134
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:47,847
Nope.

135
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:50,950
Really? Well,
agree to disagree.

136
00:05:50,952 --> 00:05:52,819
Wait, I don't wanna disagree.

137
00:05:52,821 --> 00:05:54,520
No, no. It's just
a fancy way to say

138
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:56,022
we don't have to
argue about it.

139
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:57,857
We're arguing?
I don't wanna argue.

140
00:05:57,859 --> 00:06:00,560
Relax. Stop making it
a thing.

141
00:06:00,562 --> 00:06:03,196
Go to work. I'll see you
tonight, stench vessel.

142
00:06:03,198 --> 00:06:04,163
All right.

143
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:11,840
She wants a new track,
I'll give her a new track.

144
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:18,013
Come on, Nafisa!
Let's play <i>Sugar Rush!</i>

145
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:20,847
Pick Vanellope, Swati.

146
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:22,582
She's got
the best superpower.

147
00:06:22,584 --> 00:06:24,984
Yeah, the glitch. I love her.

148
00:06:24,986 --> 00:06:25,985
<i>Drivers,</i>

149
00:06:25,987 --> 00:06:28,221
<i>start your engines.</i>

150
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:31,090
You're gonna lose today,
Princess.

151
00:06:31,092 --> 00:06:34,228
While, yes, I am technically
a princess, Taffyta...

152
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:37,231
I'd rather you just think of
me as plain old Vanellope...

153
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:39,732
the racer who's about to
kick your butt.

154
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:42,637
<i>Three, two, one, go!</i>

155
00:06:46,942 --> 00:06:49,678
And pardon me, excuse me,
coming through.

156
00:06:53,014 --> 00:06:54,547
Whoo-hoo!

157
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:55,850
Whoo!

158
00:06:57,585 --> 00:07:01,888
And one, two, three gumballs
right on cue.

159
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,856
Yeah, I love it
when she glitches.

160
00:07:08,663 --> 00:07:09,829
Ooh! Huh.

161
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:11,931
Excuse me.
I must have fallen asleep.

162
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:14,068
Oh, fun. I'm winning.

163
00:07:16,072 --> 00:07:17,870
<i>Vanellope takes a huge lead.</i>

164
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:20,508
<i>No one's gonna catch her now.</i>

165
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,246
She's gonna love this.

166
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:29,185
Right on time.

167
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:32,785
What?

168
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:34,756
"Looking for something new...

169
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,057
"and different?

170
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:40,127
"Then take this track."

171
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:42,162
Oh, Ralph,
you old son-of-a-gun.

172
00:07:42,164 --> 00:07:44,630
I'd say I got a little time
for a detour.

173
00:07:44,632 --> 00:07:46,066
Whoa!

174
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:48,936
Hey, look, I think
I unlocked a new track.

175
00:07:48,938 --> 00:07:51,704
Never seen that before.

176
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:55,142
This is awesome!

177
00:07:55,144 --> 00:07:57,311
Hey, thanks, Ralph!

178
00:07:57,313 --> 00:07:59,113
You're welcome!

179
00:07:59,115 --> 00:08:00,881
Get back up
on the track, Swati.

180
00:08:00,883 --> 00:08:02,249
You're going to lose.

181
00:08:02,251 --> 00:08:04,719
I can't.
It's like it's driving itself.

182
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:09,923
Whoo!

183
00:08:09,925 --> 00:08:11,826
What is wrong with
this thing?

184
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:14,161
What?

185
00:08:19,835 --> 00:08:22,104
No, no!

186
00:08:22,604 --> 00:08:23,605
Kid!

187
00:08:31,113 --> 00:08:32,980
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

188
00:08:32,982 --> 00:08:34,948
Kid! Kid!

189
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,682
Oh, kid, I'm so sorry,
are you okay?

190
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:38,684
Oh, my gosh.

191
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:40,120
What an amazing track!

192
00:08:40,122 --> 00:08:42,956
Thank you, Ralph! Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

193
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,291
You're welcome!

194
00:08:44,293 --> 00:08:46,860
You know I take my duty
as your hero very seriously.

195
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:48,028
Wait a minute.

196
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,930
You took a serious
doody where?

197
00:08:52,001 --> 00:08:53,367
Vanellope, get up here.

198
00:08:53,369 --> 00:08:55,004
We have a situation.

199
00:08:56,338 --> 00:09:00,207
Mr. Litwak, the Vanellope
racer wasn't working...

200
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:03,177
and I think maybe I
turned the wheel too hard.

201
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:05,012
- Whoa.
- I'm real sorry.

202
00:09:05,014 --> 00:09:06,346
It's okay, Swati.

203
00:09:06,348 --> 00:09:08,215
I think I can get it back
on there pretty easy.

204
00:09:08,217 --> 00:09:10,717
- What did you do, Ralph?
- Nothing.

205
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:11,819
Leave him alone.

206
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:13,754
He was just trying to
make the game more exciting.

207
00:09:13,756 --> 00:09:16,757
Yeah, why don't you relax,
Taffyta? Litwak will fix it.

208
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,759
All right, on you...

209
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:20,360
Oh!

210
00:09:20,362 --> 00:09:22,696
Okay. Still not a problem.

211
00:09:22,698 --> 00:09:23,897
He'll just order a new part.

212
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:25,165
Well, I'd order a new part...

213
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:26,867
but the company
that made <i>Sugar Rush</i>

214
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:28,035
went out of business
years ago.

215
00:09:29,338 --> 00:09:30,904
I can try to find one
on the Internet.

216
00:09:30,906 --> 00:09:32,005
- Good idea.
- Oh, me too.

217
00:09:32,007 --> 00:09:33,774
Good luck, that'll be like
finding a needle in a...

218
00:09:33,776 --> 00:09:35,309
I found one! On ebay!

219
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:37,044
Really? How about that?

220
00:09:37,046 --> 00:09:39,246
See? Those kids
have it under control.

221
00:09:39,248 --> 00:09:41,281
They're just gonna get
another wheel from the eboy.

222
00:09:41,283 --> 00:09:43,083
Are you
kidding me? How much?

223
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:45,385
That's more than this game
makes in a year.

224
00:09:45,387 --> 00:09:47,020
Aw, I hate to say it,

225
00:09:47,022 --> 00:09:49,356
but my salvage guy
is coming on Friday...

226
00:09:49,358 --> 00:09:52,159
and it might be time to sell
<i>Sugar Rush</i> for parts.

227
00:09:52,161 --> 00:09:55,229
- Aww.
- Where's he going?

228
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:56,897
Litwak's gonna
unplug the game.

229
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:58,031
Get out of here!
Go, scram, let's go, run!

230
00:09:58,033 --> 00:09:59,467
Go, run, run,
run, run!

231
00:09:59,469 --> 00:10:00,302
- Let's go!
- Run!

232
00:10:08,744 --> 00:10:10,043
Gangway!

233
00:10:10,045 --> 00:10:11,078
Yeah,
you heard him, gangway!

234
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,213
Stop it! No running!

235
00:10:13,215 --> 00:10:15,115
What are you people doing
out of your game,

236
00:10:15,117 --> 00:10:16,283
for Peter's sake?

237
00:10:16,285 --> 00:10:18,252
The arcade is open!

238
00:10:18,254 --> 00:10:20,053
<i>Sugar Rush</i>
is getting unplugged.

239
00:10:26,862 --> 00:10:30,130
- We're homeless!
- Yeah, yeah, we're homeless!

240
00:10:30,132 --> 00:10:32,766
Oh, what are we going to do?

241
00:10:32,768 --> 00:10:36,170
Y'all, calm down, calm down.
Get a hold of yourselves.

242
00:10:36,172 --> 00:10:37,804
I don't want to be gameless.

243
00:10:38,908 --> 00:10:41,008
An unplugging.
Good Lord.

244
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,110
I haven't seen
this many gameless characters

245
00:10:43,112 --> 00:10:45,114
since <i>Space Invaders</i>
went down.

246
00:10:45,315 --> 00:10:46,914
Um...

247
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,949
Where are we gonna live?

248
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:51,319
Well, you can stay here until
the arcade closes, I guess...

249
00:10:51,321 --> 00:10:52,853
and then we'll figure out

250
00:10:52,855 --> 00:10:54,757
where the heck
we're gonna put you all.

251
00:11:09,772 --> 00:11:10,973
Okay.

252
00:11:11,474 --> 00:11:13,174
Here we go.

253
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:14,442
I raided Gene's fridge.

254
00:11:14,444 --> 00:11:16,843
Good news, he's got pie.

255
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:18,346
Took a bunch of his pillows
and junk, too.

256
00:11:18,348 --> 00:11:21,782
I'm thinking we make a fort
up here, or like a yurt.

257
00:11:21,784 --> 00:11:23,484
Or we could take
these pillows...

258
00:11:23,486 --> 00:11:24,851
If we stack them right,

259
00:11:24,853 --> 00:11:26,954
we can make an igloo
out of pillows.

260
00:11:26,956 --> 00:11:30,124
Like a pillow igloo.
Pigloo. Pigloo!

261
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:31,092
So what do you think, kid?

262
00:11:31,094 --> 00:11:34,164
Fort, yurt, or the obvious
best choice, pigloo?

263
00:11:35,798 --> 00:11:39,167
I can't believe I don't have
a game anymore.

264
00:11:39,169 --> 00:11:42,337
I mean, like, what am I
gonna do all day?

265
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:45,006
What? Come on,
are you kidding?

266
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:46,474
You sleep in,
you do no work,

267
00:11:46,476 --> 00:11:48,875
then you go to Tapper's
with me every night.

268
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:50,844
I've literally
just described paradise.

269
00:11:50,846 --> 00:11:52,846
But I loved my game.

270
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:53,814
Oh, come on.

271
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:55,116
You were just bellyaching
about the tracks

272
00:11:55,118 --> 00:11:56,284
being too easy.

273
00:11:56,286 --> 00:11:58,453
No, that doesn't mean
I didn't love it.

274
00:11:58,455 --> 00:12:02,190
Yeah, sure,
it was kind of predictable...

275
00:12:02,192 --> 00:12:06,827
but still I never really knew
what might happen in a race.

276
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:08,396
And it's that,
it's that feeling,

277
00:12:08,398 --> 00:12:11,366
that not-knowing-what's-
coming-next feeling.

278
00:12:11,368 --> 00:12:15,438
That's the stuff.
That feels like life to me.

279
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,807
And if I'm not a racer,
Ralph...

280
00:12:20,844 --> 00:12:22,176
what am I?

281
00:12:22,178 --> 00:12:23,544
Well, you're my best friend.

282
00:12:23,546 --> 00:12:24,979
That's not enough.

283
00:12:24,981 --> 00:12:26,114
Hey.

284
00:12:26,116 --> 00:12:27,949
No, I just...

285
00:12:27,951 --> 00:12:30,920
I'm sorry,
I know I'm being weird.

286
00:12:32,856 --> 00:12:36,524
I think maybe I just need
to be alone right now.

287
00:12:36,526 --> 00:12:37,560
Oh.

288
00:12:38,628 --> 00:12:41,095
Okay.

289
00:12:41,097 --> 00:12:43,566
I'll meet you over at Tapper's
in a little while, I guess.

290
00:12:44,534 --> 00:12:46,303
If you want.

291
00:12:48,505 --> 00:12:50,104
<i>All right, now...</i>

292
00:12:50,106 --> 00:12:51,372
<i>we found some good homes</i>

293
00:12:51,374 --> 00:12:53,308
<i>for so many of our chums</i>
<i>from</i> Sugar Rush...

294
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,076
and we're just hoping
a few more of you

295
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:56,244
will open your doors...

296
00:12:56,246 --> 00:12:58,246
and your hearts
to those in need.

297
00:12:58,248 --> 00:13:01,049
Well, I suppose
that large green olive

298
00:13:01,051 --> 00:13:02,884
will fit in nicely
with my decor.

299
00:13:02,886 --> 00:13:05,119
I'm a sour ball.

300
00:13:05,121 --> 00:13:07,922
Well, beggars can't be
choosers, can they?

301
00:13:07,924 --> 00:13:09,457
Come along, condiment.

302
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:11,225
Mm-kay.

303
00:13:11,227 --> 00:13:14,197
Marvelous.
That just leaves the racers.

304
00:13:14,998 --> 00:13:16,597
We're, like, adorable.

305
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:18,366
You sure are.

306
00:13:18,368 --> 00:13:20,535
So, any takers?

307
00:13:23,106 --> 00:13:24,505
Um...

308
00:13:24,507 --> 00:13:26,242
Anyone?

309
00:13:29,412 --> 00:13:32,480
Felix, I know
we've never once talked about

310
00:13:32,482 --> 00:13:34,449
having a family before, but...

311
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:36,351
I know, it feels
like the kind of thing

312
00:13:36,353 --> 00:13:37,919
you just jump into
with both feet...

313
00:13:37,921 --> 00:13:39,655
and nary a plan.

314
00:13:39,657 --> 00:13:42,457
Felix and I will
give them sanctuary.

315
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:44,992
Can I get a quick word
with you two?

316
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:49,397
Look, I get it.

317
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,099
You've been married
six years,

318
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:52,501
you're looking to
spice things up...

319
00:13:52,503 --> 00:13:54,603
but trust me,
adopting 15 children

320
00:13:54,605 --> 00:13:56,437
is the wrong kind of spice.

321
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:58,373
Those things
are basically feral.

322
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:03,378
Pardon me, sir, but those
youngsters are lambs.

323
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:07,181
Lost little lambs in need of
two kind, caring shepherds.

324
00:14:07,183 --> 00:14:08,349
That's right.

325
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:11,520
Besides, how hard
can parenting be?

326
00:14:11,522 --> 00:14:13,354
You treat the child
like your best friend...

327
00:14:13,356 --> 00:14:15,223
you give them
everything they want...

328
00:14:15,225 --> 00:14:16,658
and you just love
their little socks off.

329
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,025
Right, Tammy?

330
00:14:18,027 --> 00:14:19,595
Darn-tootin'.

331
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:21,262
Huh?

332
00:14:22,332 --> 00:14:23,432
Come and get it.

333
00:14:23,434 --> 00:14:24,500
Get your own candle.

334
00:14:24,502 --> 00:14:27,168
Hey, Mom,
why does your lame TV

335
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,670
only have one channel?

336
00:14:28,672 --> 00:14:31,540
Well,
hate to say I told ya...

337
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:33,141
Ow!

338
00:14:43,987 --> 00:14:45,153
Hey, Tapper?

339
00:14:45,155 --> 00:14:47,256
No, Ralph.
I haven't seen Vanellope.

340
00:14:47,258 --> 00:14:50,325
Not since the last time
you asked me 30 seconds ago.

341
00:14:50,327 --> 00:14:52,561
Sorry. I'm just
worried about her.

342
00:14:52,563 --> 00:14:56,632
She's glitching like crazy,
and acting super insecure.

343
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:58,667
Oh. And get this,
she said...

344
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:01,171
being friends with me
wasn't enough for her.

345
00:15:02,172 --> 00:15:04,038
Not enough?
I'm a great friend!

346
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,707
Right, Tapper? Right?

347
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:08,075
I'm sorry.
Who's acting insecure?

348
00:15:08,077 --> 00:15:09,445
Ralph, come on.

349
00:15:09,447 --> 00:15:12,247
The kid just lost her game.
Give her a break.

350
00:15:13,484 --> 00:15:15,350
There you are... Oh.

351
00:15:15,352 --> 00:15:16,452
Hey, Ralph.

352
00:15:16,454 --> 00:15:19,020
Hey, Felix. Since when
do you drink root beer?

353
00:15:19,022 --> 00:15:20,255
Since tonight.

354
00:15:20,257 --> 00:15:22,291
Yeah, I hear you, buddy.

355
00:15:22,293 --> 00:15:24,526
Hey, listen. This one was
supposed to be for Vanellope.

356
00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:25,694
I guess you can have it.

357
00:15:25,696 --> 00:15:27,429
Doesn't look like
she's coming.

358
00:15:27,431 --> 00:15:28,597
Thanks.

359
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:30,299
You know,
I can't help but think

360
00:15:30,301 --> 00:15:32,501
this whole mess
is somehow...

361
00:15:32,503 --> 00:15:35,204
partially my fault.

362
00:15:35,206 --> 00:15:38,273
It figures. Just when
my life was perfect.

363
00:15:38,275 --> 00:15:40,108
Mine was, too.

364
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,512
But, hey,
now I'm a father of 15.

365
00:15:43,514 --> 00:15:46,114
Isn't that just a blessing?

366
00:15:49,753 --> 00:15:53,155
Eeeee-oh-boy!

367
00:15:53,157 --> 00:15:55,424
Wait. What'd
you say, Felix?

368
00:15:55,426 --> 00:15:57,626
Um, isn't that
just a blessing?

369
00:15:57,628 --> 00:15:59,228
No, the weird sound thing.

370
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,696
Oh. Eeeee-oh-boy?

371
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:02,731
Yeah. Eee-oh...

372
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:04,099
Sorry, say it again?

373
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:06,101
- Eeeee-oh-boy.
- Eeeee-oh-boy!

374
00:16:06,103 --> 00:16:08,237
- Eee-oh-boy!
- Eee-boy! Say it again?

375
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:09,404
- Eeeee-oh-boy!
- Eeeee-oh-boy.

376
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:11,740
- Eeeee-oh-boy...
- eboy! eboy! eboy!

377
00:16:11,742 --> 00:16:12,841
- eboy? eboy?
- eboy.

378
00:16:12,843 --> 00:16:14,576
Yeah.

379
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:15,777
Um, what are you getting
at there, Ralph?

380
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,546
That kid out in the arcade

381
00:16:17,548 --> 00:16:19,181
said there was
a steering wheel part...

382
00:16:19,183 --> 00:16:22,384
on the Internet, it's
something called eboy or...

383
00:16:22,386 --> 00:16:24,786
ebay! That's it,
it was ebay!

384
00:16:24,788 --> 00:16:26,455
Ralph, are you thinking about

385
00:16:26,457 --> 00:16:28,790
going to the Internet
and finding that part?

386
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:29,926
Getting that part's
the only thing

387
00:16:29,928 --> 00:16:31,827
that's gonna fix the game
and that's the only thing

388
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:33,830
that's gonna make
Vanellope happy again.

389
00:16:33,832 --> 00:16:35,664
And if <i>Sugar Rush</i> is fixed,

390
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,799
all those lovable scamps
living in my house...

391
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:40,202
and destroying my sanity

392
00:16:40,204 --> 00:16:42,638
will have homes
of their own again!

393
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,741
Ralph, this is an important mission.
A noble mission!

394
00:16:45,743 --> 00:16:46,742
I will cover for you.

395
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:48,677
Thanks, pal.

396
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:51,346
Ralph, what about your tab?
You owe me for the root beer.

397
00:16:51,348 --> 00:16:53,115
Oh, Felix is gonna
cover for me.

398
00:16:53,117 --> 00:16:55,517
Drinks on the house, everybody!
Felix is paying.

399
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,354
Shoryuken!

400
00:16:57,856 --> 00:16:59,657
Eeeee-oh-boy.

401
00:17:06,497 --> 00:17:08,397
Boo!

402
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:10,532
Ralph, what is wrong
with you?

403
00:17:10,534 --> 00:17:11,868
Start churning butter

404
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,469
and put on your church
shoes, little sister...

405
00:17:14,471 --> 00:17:17,439
'cause we're about to
blast off!

406
00:17:17,441 --> 00:17:19,641
What are you
even talking about?

407
00:17:19,643 --> 00:17:20,710
Oh, we're going to
the Internet.

408
00:17:20,712 --> 00:17:21,644
What?

409
00:17:21,646 --> 00:17:23,478
Yeah, to find the part
to fix your game.

410
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,546
No way!

411
00:17:24,548 --> 00:17:25,782
Yeah, I probably
should've just said,

412
00:17:25,784 --> 00:17:27,549
"We're going to the Internet."
We're going to the Internet!

413
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,752
Yeah, we are!

414
00:17:29,754 --> 00:17:32,487
Hey, Surge,
are we glad to see you.

415
00:17:32,489 --> 00:17:33,856
We want to report
some malfeasance

416
00:17:33,858 --> 00:17:35,324
over by the <i>Whac-A-Mole.</i>

417
00:17:35,326 --> 00:17:36,893
Yeah, we saw
some undesirables

418
00:17:36,895 --> 00:17:39,528
causing a real donnybrook
over there.

419
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,664
Oh, heck no.
Not on my watch.

420
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:42,867
Appreciate the tip.

421
00:17:48,238 --> 00:17:50,238
So, all we gotta do
is find this eboy place.

422
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,841
- Ebay.
- Right, ebay.

423
00:17:51,843 --> 00:17:54,176
So we go there,
get the steering wheel...

424
00:17:54,178 --> 00:17:55,678
we have it delivered
to Litwak before Friday.

425
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,245
He'll fix your game.

426
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,815
Everything goes back
to the way it was.

427
00:17:58,817 --> 00:18:00,617
Boom! Happily ever after.

428
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:02,250
This is a shockingly sound,

429
00:18:02,252 --> 00:18:03,753
well-thought-out idea
for you, Ralph.

430
00:18:03,755 --> 00:18:04,887
No offense.

431
00:18:04,889 --> 00:18:06,421
I know. And none taken.

432
00:18:06,423 --> 00:18:07,590
Ooh, here it comes.

433
00:18:07,592 --> 00:18:09,659
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls...

434
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:11,863
I give you the Internet!

435
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:16,566
Huh.

436
00:18:16,568 --> 00:18:18,601
The Internet is
not nearly as impressive

437
00:18:18,603 --> 00:18:20,470
as how Sonic described it.

438
00:18:20,472 --> 00:18:22,739
Yeah, I gotta admit,
I'm underwhelmed.

439
00:18:22,741 --> 00:18:25,273
Where do you think
they keep their ebay?

440
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:26,241
Beats me.

441
00:18:26,243 --> 00:18:28,343
Hello, anybody here?

442
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:29,779
Anyone? Hello!

443
00:18:29,781 --> 00:18:31,948
We're looking for ebay!

444
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,851
Ooh. Did you hear that, kid?
Sweet echo.

445
00:18:34,853 --> 00:18:36,318
Check this out.

446
00:18:39,524 --> 00:18:42,392
Hoolie-hoo!
Hoolie-hoo!

447
00:18:42,394 --> 00:18:44,594
Okay, connect to network.

448
00:18:44,596 --> 00:18:46,696
Bingo.

449
00:18:46,698 --> 00:18:50,769
Password is "high score"
with a zero instead of an "o."

450
00:18:51,436 --> 00:18:52,602
Yes.

451
00:18:52,604 --> 00:18:54,839
And we are online.

452
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,980
Hoolie-hoo!

453
00:19:03,982 --> 00:19:06,582
Hoolie-hoolie-hoo!

454
00:19:06,584 --> 00:19:08,284
Ooh, Ralph, look.

455
00:19:08,286 --> 00:19:10,553
Cool. Mood lighting.

456
00:19:14,693 --> 00:19:15,758
Ahhh! That's a gremlin!
Stay away! It's a gremlin!

457
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,228
It looks like
a tiny Mr. Litwak.

458
00:19:19,364 --> 00:19:21,266
<i>IP address 415-1037-483.</i>

459
00:19:22,534 --> 00:19:24,701
Oh, cool! Come on, Ralph,
let's follow him!

460
00:19:24,703 --> 00:19:26,869
Hey, wait for me!
Kid, come back! Wait!

461
00:19:26,871 --> 00:19:28,838
Hey!
Don't leave without me!

462
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,306
<i>IP address 415-1037-483.</i>

463
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:32,610
Vanellope!

464
00:19:34,612 --> 00:19:36,412
I can't breathe.
I don't fit.

465
00:19:40,285 --> 00:19:42,018
Whoo-hoo!

466
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,321
Yeah! Whoo!

467
00:19:57,502 --> 00:19:58,701
Kid!

468
00:19:58,703 --> 00:20:00,503
Ralph! Isn't this great?

469
00:20:00,505 --> 00:20:02,405
No, it is not!

470
00:20:02,407 --> 00:20:03,808
Whoo-hoo!

471
00:20:08,981 --> 00:20:10,080
No, no, no.

472
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,989
Whoa!

473
00:20:45,918 --> 00:20:47,951
Sweet mother
of monkey milk!

474
00:20:47,953 --> 00:20:49,987
Whoa!

475
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:52,455
Kid, I don't think
we're in Litwak's anymore.

476
00:20:52,457 --> 00:20:55,424
We most certainly
are not, friendo.

477
00:20:55,426 --> 00:20:58,530
We are in the Internet!
Come on, Ralph!

478
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,039
Holy cow!

479
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,406
Look at all this stuff.

480
00:21:10,408 --> 00:21:11,707
Whoa.

481
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:15,580
This is the most beautiful
miracle I've ever seen.

482
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:18,648
But it's so big.

483
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,884
It goes on
forever and ever.

484
00:21:20,886 --> 00:21:22,418
How are we
possibly gonna find

485
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,619
ebay out there?

486
00:21:23,621 --> 00:21:26,422
Hey, kid. Kid, don't worry.

487
00:21:26,424 --> 00:21:27,658
I'm sure
there's someone out here

488
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,660
who could give us directions.
Oh!

489
00:21:29,662 --> 00:21:31,061
Look at that little egg guy.

490
00:21:31,063 --> 00:21:32,796
He's got on one of those hats
that smart people wear.

491
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:34,631
I bet he could
help us. Come on.

492
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:36,399
Welcome back
to the search bar, madam.

493
00:21:36,401 --> 00:21:37,466
I hope you were able
to find

00:21:37,468 --> 00:21:39,102
a satisfactory

00:21:39,104 --> 00:21:41,872

I provided this morning.

What can KnowsMore
help you find now?

497
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:47,044
Where can I find ballet...?

498
00:21:47,046 --> 00:21:48,912
Ballet shoes? Ballet classes?
Ballet folklorico?

499
00:21:48,914 --> 00:21:50,047
...tights?

500
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:51,114
<i>Girls' size small.</i>

501
00:21:51,116 --> 00:21:54,117
Oh, little Madeline's
trying ballet now, is she?

502
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,955
I hope this lasts longer
than the soccer phase.

503
00:21:58,691 --> 00:21:59,823
Hmm.

504
00:21:59,825 --> 00:22:01,692

00:22:11,737 --> 00:22:13,770
Oh, hello, sir.

510
00:22:13,772 --> 00:22:15,739
Interesting, you don't seem to
have a search history.

511
00:22:15,741 --> 00:22:17,174
Well, let's start one for you.

Looks like no one put
Humpty Dumpty together again.

519
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,856
This guy's
a little soft-boiled.

520
00:22:32,858 --> 00:22:33,991
I'm pretty sure
he's just trying to

00:22:33,993 --> 00:22:35,492
guess what you're gonna say.

00:22:35,494 --> 00:22:36,760
Yes. I'm sorry,

00:22:36,762 --> 00:22:39,529

is a touch aggressive today.

What? How did you...?

530
00:22:53,512 --> 00:22:55,212
Ah, the Internet's
very intuitive.

531
00:22:55,214 --> 00:22:57,114
Thank you, Mr. KnowsMore.

532
00:22:57,116 --> 00:22:58,882
Well, you're welcome.

533
00:22:58,884 --> 00:23:00,617
<i>Redirecting to ebay.</i>

534
00:23:02,054 --> 00:23:06,023
I like her.
What a delightful girl.

535
00:23:06,025 --> 00:23:08,492
<i>Slow traffic

536
00:23:08,494 --> 00:23:10,729
<i>less than three megabytes
per second.</i>

537
00:23:37,556 --> 00:23:39,056
Wow, I guess
we know where to go

538
00:23:39,058 --> 00:23:41,858
if we ever need
a pair of goggles.

539
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,694
There's a whole building
full of them.

540
00:23:43,696 --> 00:23:45,165
Oh! There it is! ebay!

541
00:23:53,806 --> 00:23:55,106
Ralph, we're really
gonna do it.

542
00:23:55,108 --> 00:23:57,007
We're actually gonna
save my game.

543
00:23:57,009 --> 00:23:58,242
Told you not to worry.

544
00:23:58,244 --> 00:24:01,745
We just gotta keep our eyes
on the prize and stay focused.

545
00:24:01,747 --> 00:24:04,014
Get rid of belly fat
using this one weird trick.

546
00:24:04,016 --> 00:24:05,649
Ooh! I love weird tricks.

547
00:24:05,651 --> 00:24:06,583
Sassy housewives
want to meet you.

548
00:24:06,585 --> 00:24:07,884
They do?

549
00:24:07,886 --> 00:24:08,919
Congratulations,
you're a winner!

550
00:24:08,921 --> 00:24:09,820
Really?

551
00:24:09,822 --> 00:24:11,588
These ten child stars
went to prison.

552
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,756
Number six will amaze you.

553
00:24:12,758 --> 00:24:13,924
Ooh. That sounds
interesting.

554
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:15,126

But there's a lot of
cool stuff here.

558
00:24:19,631 --> 00:24:22,033
I'll be right here if you
change your mind, brother.

559
00:24:22,035 --> 00:24:22,933
Ooh, how about you, lady?

560
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:24,536
You wanna get rich
playing video games?

561
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:30,841
Ladies and gentlemen,
the next item up...

562
00:24:30,843 --> 00:24:32,743
a black velvet painting
of a sorrowful kitten.

563
00:24:32,745 --> 00:24:34,312
Bidding starts at 49.99.

564
00:24:34,314 --> 00:24:35,213
850 for the beaver,

565
00:24:35,215 --> 00:24:36,548
the beautifully
taxidermied beaver...

566
00:24:39,152 --> 00:24:40,952
...a gently used
artificial hip...

567
00:24:40,954 --> 00:24:42,954
and the bidding's open
at $10. Do I hear 20?

568
00:24:42,956 --> 00:24:44,322
Do I hear 350?
Who'll give me 350?

569
00:24:44,324 --> 00:24:45,289
50, 50, 50 now.

570
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:46,790
- Who'll give me 350?
<i>- 400!</i>

571
00:24:46,792 --> 00:24:48,126
Going once,
going twice and sold!

572
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,293
The tortilla chip shaped like

573
00:24:49,295 --> 00:24:52,230
international superstar Beyonce Knowles...
goes for 400.

574
00:24:52,232 --> 00:24:53,998
<i>Yay! So happy.</i>

575
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,100
Are you understanding
how this game works?

576
00:24:56,102 --> 00:24:59,270
I think all you have to do is
yell out the biggest number...

577
00:24:59,272 --> 00:25:01,806
and then you win this stuff.

578
00:25:01,808 --> 00:25:03,707
And I thought
Qbert's game was weird.

579
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:04,674
Hey, kid, hop up here...

580
00:25:04,676 --> 00:25:05,977
and see if you can tell

581
00:25:05,979 --> 00:25:06,846
where they keep
their steering wheels.

582
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:08,980
Uh, there's a bunch of

583
00:25:08,982 --> 00:25:11,249
sports memberabilia.

584
00:25:11,251 --> 00:25:14,152
And big baby clothes
called "lingerie."

585
00:25:14,154 --> 00:25:16,354
- Huh.
- Go to the right, move right.

586
00:25:16,356 --> 00:25:19,090
Oh. There's a row with a
bunch of old video game junk!

587
00:25:19,092 --> 00:25:21,259
Oh, there it is!
There it is! I see it!

588
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:22,794
Oh, someone else
is trying to win it.

589
00:25:22,796 --> 00:25:24,395
Come on! Hurry, let's go!

590
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:25,463
We got 275.

591
00:25:25,465 --> 00:25:27,698
And with 30 seconds left
in the auction, we have 275.

592
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,000
Move! Move! Hey!

593
00:25:29,002 --> 00:25:30,368
- That's ours! Out of the way!
- Do I hear a three?

594
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:31,736
- I'll give you three!
- I got three!

595
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:32,970
Can I get a 305? 305?
Can I get a 3-5?

596
00:25:32,972 --> 00:25:34,972
- <i>305.</i>
- 305, can I get a 310?

597
00:25:34,974 --> 00:25:36,307
- Can you bid 310?
- 310.

598
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:37,975
- <i>315.</i>
- 320.

599
00:25:37,977 --> 00:25:39,043
<i>325.</i>

600
00:25:39,045 --> 00:25:40,978
Oh, man, this guy is good.

601
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,747
He keeps coming up with
numbers like it's nothing.

602
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,916
I have three-and-a-quarter.
Do I hear 350?

603
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,217
- 350? 350?
- Watch this.

604
00:25:46,219 --> 00:25:47,185
1,000!

605
00:25:47,187 --> 00:25:48,719
1,000!

606
00:25:48,721 --> 00:25:49,987
We now have a bid of 1,000!

607
00:25:49,989 --> 00:25:52,223
Way to go, kid!
That is a huge number.

608
00:25:52,225 --> 00:25:53,791
- Thank you.
- Check this out.

609
00:25:53,793 --> 00:25:55,359

618
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:11,209
in the broken overalls.

619
00:26:11,211 --> 00:26:12,376
Hey, that's me!

620
00:26:12,378 --> 00:26:13,711

621
00:26:13,713 --> 00:26:14,879

627
00:26:25,058 --> 00:26:26,357

California.

628
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,425
Yep!

629
00:26:27,427 --> 00:26:28,793
With expedited shipping,

630
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,895
that should arrive
Wednesday morning.

631
00:26:30,897 --> 00:26:33,364
That's two whole days before
Litwak scraps your game.

632
00:26:33,366 --> 00:26:35,233
We're way ahead of schedule.

633
00:26:35,235 --> 00:26:36,435
We rule!

634
00:26:36,437 --> 00:26:38,703
I'll just need
a credit card number.

635
00:26:38,705 --> 00:26:40,405
Sorry, what's a
credit card number?

636
00:26:40,407 --> 00:26:42,874
A credit card number.

637
00:26:42,876 --> 00:26:45,078
Number. Right.
Uh, seven.

638
00:26:45,712 --> 00:26:47,078
Excuse me?

639
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,114
Sorry, no. You're right,
ridiculous. I meant 11.

640
00:26:50,116 --> 00:26:51,916
Those aren't
credit card numbers.

641
00:26:51,918 --> 00:26:53,418
I'm pretty sure they are.

642
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,119
How exactly do you intend
to pay for this item, sir?

643
00:26:55,121 --> 00:26:57,356
You owe $27,001.

644
00:26:57,358 --> 00:26:58,923
What?

645
00:26:58,925 --> 00:27:01,326
Dollars? Dollars like money?

646
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:04,195
Yes, and if you don't
have a credit card...

647
00:27:04,197 --> 00:27:06,097
we also accept PayPal,
Venmo,

648
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:08,132
ProPay, SquareCash
and BuzzzyBucks.

649
00:27:08,134 --> 00:27:09,834
Uh...

650
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,438
You're gonna laugh. Okay.

651
00:27:13,407 --> 00:27:17,241
So this big galoot, he
left his wallet at home.

652
00:27:17,243 --> 00:27:20,111
Yeah, yeah, I did leave
my wallet at home,

653
00:27:20,113 --> 00:27:21,948
in my wallet room.
And the door's locked.

654
00:27:22,383 --> 00:27:23,915
Uh-huh.

655
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:26,184
Look. If you don't pay
within 24 hours...

656
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,353
you will be in violation
of the unpaid item policy...

657
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,821
you will forfeit the bid,
and you will lose this item.

658
00:27:30,823 --> 00:27:31,824
Next!

659
00:27:34,127 --> 00:27:35,327
Hey, buddy,
you going to eboy?

660
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:37,429
Well, I got some free advice
for you. Don't.

661
00:27:37,431 --> 00:27:39,431
What a scam!

662
00:27:39,433 --> 00:27:42,203
We were so close,
and we would have gotten...

663
00:27:43,304 --> 00:27:45,404
Look, their signs
aren't even real!

664
00:27:50,777 --> 00:27:53,212
What the heck? Dang Internet.

665
00:27:56,483 --> 00:27:59,850
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.

666
00:27:59,852 --> 00:28:02,019
Hey, kid. What's going on?
What's wrong?

667
00:28:02,021 --> 00:28:03,188
If I don't have
a steering wheel,

668
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:05,390
I don't have a game,
I'm gameless.

669
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:08,360
There's only one steering
wheel in the whole Internet...

670
00:28:08,362 --> 00:28:11,163
and we blew our chance
to get it. We blew it!

671
00:28:11,165 --> 00:28:13,131
Hey, hey, hey, calm down.

672
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:14,865
We came here
to save your game,

673
00:28:14,867 --> 00:28:15,967
and that's what
we're gonna do.

674
00:28:15,969 --> 00:28:17,035
Right.

675
00:28:17,037 --> 00:28:18,403
- Okay?
- Okay, yeah.

676
00:28:19,872 --> 00:28:21,839
There you go.

677
00:28:21,841 --> 00:28:24,042
Now look,
all we got to do...

678
00:28:24,044 --> 00:28:27,145
is figure out a way to earn
a little bit of moola.

679
00:28:27,147 --> 00:28:30,549
We're video game characters,
Ralph. We don't have moola.

680
00:28:30,551 --> 00:28:32,251
Unless you can think
of some magical way

681
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:35,055
to get rich
playing video games.

682
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:40,325

Right this way, miss.

686
00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:47,199
Dang pop-up blockers.

687
00:28:47,201 --> 00:28:49,534
Why does everybody
gotta be so mean?

688
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,903
Ooh! There he is! Oh, thank
goodness you're still here!

689
00:28:51,905 --> 00:28:55,073
Me and my friend here, we got
24 hours to make $27,001...

690
00:28:55,075 --> 00:28:56,408
or she loses her game.

691
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,576
Yeah, can you please tell us

692
00:28:57,578 --> 00:28:59,878
how to get rich
playing video games?

693
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,580
You bet!

Come on, click here, and
I'll take you to my website.

695
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:10,088
You got an ample carriage
there, buster.

696
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,356
Causing a little drag.

697
00:29:11,358 --> 00:29:12,557
Sorry. You're getting close
to the edge.

698
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,659
Huh?

699
00:29:13,661 --> 00:29:16,595
You see the...?
The edge. The edge!

700
00:29:18,565 --> 00:29:21,366
By the way,
my name is JP Spamley...

701
00:29:21,368 --> 00:29:22,901
and I'd like to welcome
the both of you

702
00:29:22,903 --> 00:29:24,436
to the Spamley family.

703
00:29:26,073 --> 00:29:29,241
All right,
step into my parlor.

704
00:29:29,243 --> 00:29:31,410
This is your website?

705
00:29:31,412 --> 00:29:33,078
I know what you're thinking,
not to worry.

706
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,613
My anti-virus guy
was just here.

707
00:29:34,615 --> 00:29:36,014
Clean as a...

708
00:29:36,016 --> 00:29:37,416
Oh!

709
00:29:37,418 --> 00:29:38,517
Dang it!

710
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:39,618
Oh, my gosh.
That's embarrassing.

711
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,486
Anyway, I know
it's a bit of a mess...

712
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,055
Hey, Gord!

713
00:29:43,057 --> 00:29:44,623
But I do have a system here,
I really do.

714
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:46,925
If I can just
find that... Gord!

715
00:29:46,927 --> 00:29:49,094
I just got to find this list.

716
00:29:49,096 --> 00:29:50,329
Oh, there you are.

717
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:53,365
These guys are looking to
get rich playing video games.

718
00:29:53,367 --> 00:29:54,535
What do you got for them,
partner?

719
00:30:03,611 --> 00:30:05,477
Thank you.

720
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:09,114
"Fishwife's amulet,
<i>Wizard Quest,</i> three dollars."

721
00:30:09,116 --> 00:30:11,083
"Foxhole hammer,

722
00:30:11,085 --> 00:30:12,984
<i>"Zombie Crusades,</i>
five dollars"?

723
00:30:12,986 --> 00:30:14,519
Now, those there are

724
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,988
some of your more
commonplace, low-dollar items.

725
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,191
Can you back up a sec,
Mr. Spamley?

726
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:21,259
Um, you're saying if we find

727
00:30:21,261 --> 00:30:22,994
the Golden Cleats

728
00:30:22,996 --> 00:30:24,630
from <i>Pro League Soccer...</i>

729
00:30:24,632 --> 00:30:27,299
we find those and bring them
back here to you...

730
00:30:27,301 --> 00:30:30,603
then a human being in the
real world will pay us $15?

731
00:30:30,605 --> 00:30:31,637
Yes, ma'am.

732
00:30:31,639 --> 00:30:34,172
Welcome to the exciting world
of loot hunting.

733
00:30:34,174 --> 00:30:35,440
Folks go into games...

734
00:30:35,442 --> 00:30:37,442
they harvest
the most coveted items...

735
00:30:37,444 --> 00:30:39,311
and they sell them
on my website

736
00:30:39,313 --> 00:30:41,346
to the highest bidder.
Ha-ha?

737
00:30:41,348 --> 00:30:43,048
Okay, but here's the thing...

738
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,117
we need like
a buttload of money.

739
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:47,555
So, do you have any more
lucrative items, maybe?

740
00:30:48,188 --> 00:30:49,189
Gord!

741
00:30:50,023 --> 00:30:51,189
Gord!

742
00:30:51,191 --> 00:30:52,092
Oh, there you are.

743
00:30:54,529 --> 00:30:56,962
Thank you, buddy.
You're such a nice guy.

744
00:30:56,964 --> 00:30:59,364
Is $40,000 lucrative
enough for you?

745
00:30:59,366 --> 00:31:00,466
- Whoa!
- Whoa.

746
00:31:00,468 --> 00:31:02,134
It's more than enough.

747
00:31:02,136 --> 00:31:04,069
I got a guy
in Des Moines, Iowa...

748
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:06,972
who will pay 40 grand
for Shank's car...

749
00:31:06,974 --> 00:31:08,674
from a game
called <i>Slaughter Race.</i>

750
00:31:08,676 --> 00:31:10,242
A racing game?

751
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:12,210
That's right. <i>Slaughter Race</i>
is the most popular

752
00:31:12,212 --> 00:31:14,212
online racing game
out there.

753
00:31:14,214 --> 00:31:16,148
However,
it is wicked dangerous.

754
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,550
We ain't afraid of danger.

755
00:31:17,552 --> 00:31:19,552
This kid's the best racer
in the whole world.

756
00:31:19,554 --> 00:31:22,588
We'll get you that car,
no problemo.

757
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:26,057
Slaughter Race!
<i>Enter at your own risk.</i>

758
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,470
Okay, this game
is kind of amazing.

759
00:31:37,405 --> 00:31:40,273
Meh, the attention to detail
is pretty impressive.

760
00:31:41,376 --> 00:31:43,376
I don't think
I've ever been in a game

761
00:31:43,378 --> 00:31:44,610
with smog before.

762
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:48,748
- Nice kitty. Nice kitty.
- Easy, boy. Easy.

763
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:54,720
Let's just find Shank's car
and get outta here.

764
00:31:54,722 --> 00:31:55,523
Agreed.

765
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:03,061
- Look. Look.
- Whoa!

766
00:32:03,063 --> 00:32:04,230
There it is.

767
00:32:04,232 --> 00:32:06,265
That car is gorgeous.

768
00:32:06,267 --> 00:32:08,234
No wonder it's worth so much.

769
00:32:09,404 --> 00:32:11,571
Aw, sugar.

770
00:32:11,573 --> 00:32:14,207
- Players. They beat us to it.
- Aw.

771
00:32:14,209 --> 00:32:16,375
<i>31 hours
of continuous gameplay...</i>

772
00:32:16,377 --> 00:32:19,111
<i>and we've finally
found Shank's car.</i>

773
00:32:19,113 --> 00:32:21,047
Let's jack this ride.

774
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:23,249
Oh, yeah, DirtySocks,
it's on.

775
00:32:23,251 --> 00:32:25,251
Jim! Jimmy?

776
00:32:25,253 --> 00:32:28,154
You're not playing that
horrible game again, are you?

777
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:29,388
No, Grandma!

778
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,723
I'm doing my homework.

779
00:32:30,725 --> 00:32:32,258
Okay, like I said...

780
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,695
<i>Let's jack this ride.</i>

781
00:32:40,134 --> 00:32:41,569
Well, well, well.

782
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:46,574
While the cat was away,
these mice tried to play.

783
00:32:50,144 --> 00:32:52,278
Hey, I think
that might be Shank.

784
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,779
Listen up, mice...

785
00:32:53,781 --> 00:32:56,849
anyone who tries to play
with this cat's ride

786
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:58,351
is gonna get got.

787
00:32:58,353 --> 00:33:01,354
<i>You're going down, Shank.</i>

788
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:03,756
Pyro. Give those punks
the works.

789
00:33:03,758 --> 00:33:05,260
With pleasure.

790
00:33:08,296 --> 00:33:10,463
<i>End of the road!</i>

791
00:33:10,465 --> 00:33:12,634
Gosh dang it!
Now we gotta start all over.

792
00:33:13,635 --> 00:33:15,201
Ralph, maybe...

793
00:33:15,203 --> 00:33:17,136
Hey, where are you going?

794
00:33:17,138 --> 00:33:19,305
I am scared.

795
00:33:19,307 --> 00:33:20,473
If we get burned up
in here,

796
00:33:20,475 --> 00:33:21,774
that's it, we're dead,
we're gone.

797
00:33:21,776 --> 00:33:23,476
So, I think we should
get outta here right now.

798
00:33:23,478 --> 00:33:26,312
No, wait, wait.
I have an idea.

799
00:33:28,483 --> 00:33:29,816
Hey, Shank?

800
00:33:29,818 --> 00:33:31,384
What's up, Pyro?

801
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:33,686
Um, do you ever reckon
we're going a bit too hard

802
00:33:33,688 --> 00:33:35,221
on the players?

803
00:33:35,223 --> 00:33:38,257
Honestly, no, I don't.

804
00:33:38,259 --> 00:33:42,261
Of course, I have empathy for
players like DirtySocks537

805
00:33:42,263 --> 00:33:44,265
and BabeRaham_Linkin...

806
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,365
but if we just let them win,

807
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:48,668
where's the life lesson?
You know?

808
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:52,171
- Mmm.
- Yeah, but to Pyro's point...

809
00:33:52,173 --> 00:33:54,607
I mean, those players
work so hard to get here.

810
00:33:54,609 --> 00:33:56,375
I hear you, Felony...

811
00:33:56,377 --> 00:33:58,544
but imagine a game
without challenges.

812
00:33:58,546 --> 00:34:01,514
The same predictable thing
every single time...

813
00:34:01,516 --> 00:34:02,716
who wants that?

814
00:34:02,718 --> 00:34:03,750
Shank's right.

815
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:06,820
I just saw a really
insightful TED talk...

816
00:34:06,822 --> 00:34:08,855
and I can't really remember
what the guy said.

817
00:34:08,857 --> 00:34:10,891
It was more about
how he made me feel.

818
00:34:10,893 --> 00:34:13,392
But I think, ultimately,
the point was...

819
00:34:13,394 --> 00:34:16,562
I honor your journeys, guys.

820
00:34:16,564 --> 00:34:18,632
And we honor yours,
Butcher Boy.

821
00:34:18,634 --> 00:34:19,766
Thank you.

822
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:20,767
Hey, Shank,

823
00:34:20,769 --> 00:34:22,569
did you ever wonder
what it would be like...

824
00:34:22,571 --> 00:34:24,437
if someone actually
did get your car?

825
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:25,906
Well, I know one thing...

826
00:34:25,908 --> 00:34:28,507
whoever does will have to
be the best of the best.

827
00:34:32,246 --> 00:34:34,180
Good day to you, madam.

828
00:34:34,182 --> 00:34:35,381
Who are you?

829
00:34:35,383 --> 00:34:38,785
I'm here from the, uh,
Department of Noise.

830
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:40,887
And the thing is, we've been
getting some complaints

831
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:42,556
down at HQ.

832
00:34:42,558 --> 00:34:44,491
Uh, Larry's the one
who takes the calls.

833
00:34:44,493 --> 00:34:45,859
Anyways, someone told Larry...

834
00:34:45,861 --> 00:34:47,193
that we've been
hearing a lot of

835
00:34:47,195 --> 00:34:48,595
gun sounds
and screaming sounds...

836
00:34:48,597 --> 00:34:50,564
and what-have-you.
That sort of thing.

837
00:34:50,566 --> 00:34:53,869
Whoa! This is nice.

838
00:34:55,403 --> 00:34:58,304
Where have you been
all my life?

839
00:34:58,306 --> 00:35:00,406
Uh, so I came to
check on things.

840
00:35:00,408 --> 00:35:01,975
Oh, I'm sorry, who did
you say you were again?

841
00:35:01,977 --> 00:35:04,444
Oh, I'm Larry?

842
00:35:04,446 --> 00:35:06,379
Uh, you said
Larry took the call.

843
00:35:13,756 --> 00:35:15,722
Good job, Larry!

844
00:35:15,724 --> 00:35:18,226
Yeah, worked like a charm!

845
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:26,433
<i>Are you kidding me?
Someone got Shank's car?</i>

846
00:35:26,435 --> 00:35:28,303
And I need yours. Sorry.

847
00:35:30,506 --> 00:35:32,608
<i>I'm just...
I'm just gonna go.</i>

848
00:35:35,477 --> 00:35:37,479
This is the worst day
of my life!

849
00:35:38,681 --> 00:35:40,447
It's a shame
we have to leave so soon.

850
00:35:40,449 --> 00:35:41,982
This game is cool.

851
00:35:41,984 --> 00:35:43,016
Just get us out of here

852
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:45,285
so we can get this car
to Spamley and get paid.

853
00:35:45,287 --> 00:35:46,520
No problem.

854
00:35:48,724 --> 00:35:49,890
Uh-oh.

855
00:35:49,892 --> 00:35:51,760
Look at this guy
coming in hot.

856
00:36:08,377 --> 00:36:10,779
You mess with the bull, you
get the horns, little girl!

857
00:36:15,417 --> 00:36:16,952
You still have value,
Butcher Boy.

858
00:36:20,556 --> 00:36:22,689
Oh, no!
It's that Shank lady.

859
00:36:22,691 --> 00:36:23,990
She looks upset.

860
00:36:23,992 --> 00:36:26,293
Ah, don't worry,
I'll lose her.

861
00:36:34,837 --> 00:36:36,470
Where are you going?

862
00:36:36,472 --> 00:36:38,972
Kid, get back on the track.
I'm gonna lose my cookies.

863
00:36:38,974 --> 00:36:41,310
There is no track.
I can drive anywhere.

864
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:42,978
Whoo!

865
00:36:56,325 --> 00:36:58,993
Oh, kid, she's coming up
right behind us.

866
00:36:58,995 --> 00:37:00,360
Oh, hello!

867
00:37:00,362 --> 00:37:02,362
I believe you have
something of mine.

868
00:37:02,364 --> 00:37:03,766
Yeah, come and get it.

869
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:16,946
Ooh!

870
00:37:18,747 --> 00:37:20,816
This girl can drive.

871
00:37:31,727 --> 00:37:33,127
Would you hurry up
and lose her?

872
00:37:33,129 --> 00:37:34,030
I'm trying!

873
00:37:35,832 --> 00:37:37,932
Hang on, chumbo!

874
00:37:44,107 --> 00:37:45,842
I don't like this!

875
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,721
Whoa! Mother Hubbard,
this lady can really drive.

876
00:38:00,723 --> 00:38:02,589
Kid, fire!
Do you see the fire?

877
00:38:02,591 --> 00:38:03,758
Dead end! Dead end!

878
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,426
Not for me. Bye-bye, Shanky.

879
00:38:07,797 --> 00:38:09,063
Whoo-hoo!

880
00:38:09,065 --> 00:38:10,832
- Oh, yeah!
- That's the stuff.

881
00:38:10,834 --> 00:38:11,933
Good job, kid.

882
00:38:11,935 --> 00:38:14,769
Oh, yeah,
I feel like me again.

883
00:38:14,771 --> 00:38:16,773
One exit straight ahead.

884
00:38:35,524 --> 00:38:36,624
You're not gonna lose me
that easy.

885
00:38:36,626 --> 00:38:37,925
How did you...?

886
00:38:37,927 --> 00:38:39,459
Uh, you might wanna keep
your eyes on the road.

887
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:40,728
Kid!

888
00:38:48,004 --> 00:38:51,672
Yo, Department of Noise,
get out of my car!

889
00:38:51,674 --> 00:38:53,107
Oh, man,
what are we gonna do?

890
00:38:53,109 --> 00:38:55,009
You just stay put,
don't panic.

891
00:38:55,011 --> 00:38:56,177
I'm gonna talk to her.

892
00:38:56,179 --> 00:38:57,712
Ralph, be careful.

893
00:38:57,714 --> 00:39:00,781
It's fine.
This is what heroes do.

894
00:39:03,486 --> 00:39:04,954
My bottom is stuck.

895
00:39:07,891 --> 00:39:10,625
This car is not designed
for a big boy.

896
00:39:10,627 --> 00:39:12,493
I'll tell you that. Hi.

897
00:39:12,495 --> 00:39:14,996
You guys really thought
you could just steal my car?

898
00:39:14,998 --> 00:39:17,531
Well, let me tell you
what's gonna happen now.

899
00:39:17,533 --> 00:39:20,134
No, wait, listen. We aren't
normally car thieves.

900
00:39:20,136 --> 00:39:23,638
My friend here,
she's a candy kart racer.

901
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,639
You should see her
racing around

902
00:39:24,641 --> 00:39:26,474
her sweet little track...

903
00:39:26,476 --> 00:39:27,942
in her cookie wafer car
we built together.

904
00:39:29,112 --> 00:39:33,781
And, well, the thing is, her
perfect little game broke...

905
00:39:33,783 --> 00:39:35,783
and it was my fault...

906
00:39:35,785 --> 00:39:37,952
so we're here
to try to fix it...

907
00:39:37,954 --> 00:39:39,120
and we need money to do that,

908
00:39:39,122 --> 00:39:40,855
and someone was
gonna pay us money...

909
00:39:40,857 --> 00:39:42,556
- to steal your car...
- Okay, okay.

910
00:39:42,558 --> 00:39:44,592
- ...and so we took it.
- You can stop crying.

911
00:39:44,594 --> 00:39:45,860
Though I do respect

912
00:39:45,862 --> 00:39:47,561
your wonderful display
of vulnerability.

913
00:39:47,563 --> 00:39:49,264
Thank you.

914
00:39:49,266 --> 00:39:51,165
I get it, I do.

915
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:53,701
Friendship is
everything to us, too.

916
00:39:53,703 --> 00:39:56,037
- Right, guys?
- Word. We're like family.

917
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:57,872
That's really great.

918
00:39:57,874 --> 00:39:59,874
So, does this mean
we can keep your car?

919
00:39:59,876 --> 00:40:02,877
Absolutely not.
But I do want to help.

920
00:40:02,879 --> 00:40:04,045
Hey, you got
your phone on you?

921
00:40:04,047 --> 00:40:06,180
- You know it.
- Let's make a video.

922
00:40:06,182 --> 00:40:08,283
Pyro, hit big boy
with the blow and go.

923
00:40:08,285 --> 00:40:09,550
I'd love to.

924
00:40:09,552 --> 00:40:10,851
Wait. What's the...?

925
00:40:11,921 --> 00:40:13,654
What are you doing?

926
00:40:13,656 --> 00:40:15,858
Say something, first thing
that comes to your mind.

927
00:40:16,592 --> 00:40:19,194
I'm gonna wreck it!

928
00:40:19,196 --> 00:40:21,296
Good. All right.
Turn it off.

929
00:40:21,298 --> 00:40:23,965
Ow.

930
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:25,200
What the heck
did you do that for?

931
00:40:25,202 --> 00:40:26,401
Yeah.

932
00:40:26,403 --> 00:40:29,237
There are much better ways
to make money on the Internet

933
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:30,938
than stealing cars...

934
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:34,109
such as becoming
a BuzzzTube star.

935
00:40:34,111 --> 00:40:35,943
Am I supposed to know
what that is?

936
00:40:35,945 --> 00:40:38,180
Oh, come on.
Everybody knows BuzzzTube.

937
00:40:38,182 --> 00:40:40,115
It's the video-sharing site.

938
00:40:40,117 --> 00:40:41,816
I'm just starting
your account...

939
00:40:41,818 --> 00:40:44,152
All right, there you go.

940
00:40:44,154 --> 00:40:47,922
If this thing goes viral,
you can make a lot of money.

941
00:40:47,924 --> 00:40:50,025
A friend of mine,
chick named Yesss...

942
00:40:50,027 --> 00:40:51,926
she's the head algorithm
over there.

943
00:40:51,928 --> 00:40:53,295
Tell her I sent you.

944
00:40:53,297 --> 00:40:54,762
Yesss will hook you up.

945
00:40:54,764 --> 00:40:56,964
Wow, that's really nice
of you.

946
00:40:56,966 --> 00:40:58,933
I'm not sure if "nice"
is the right word.

947
00:40:58,935 --> 00:41:00,835
Well, thank you.

948
00:41:00,837 --> 00:41:02,204
I should be thanking you,
little sister.

949
00:41:02,206 --> 00:41:03,771
That race was fun.

950
00:41:03,773 --> 00:41:05,606
Oh.

951
00:41:05,608 --> 00:41:06,210
Well, thank you again.

952
00:41:07,044 --> 00:41:08,076
Uh... You know...

953
00:41:08,078 --> 00:41:10,979
While we're talking shop,
what move did you do

954
00:41:10,981 --> 00:41:12,913
to get through
that tunnel of fire?

955
00:41:12,915 --> 00:41:15,616
Was it a power drift into
a drift jump, maybe, or...?

956
00:41:15,618 --> 00:41:17,152
Maybe.

957
00:41:17,154 --> 00:41:19,254
If you ever wanna come back
for a rematch...

958
00:41:19,256 --> 00:41:21,156
I'd be happy
to kick your butt again.

959
00:41:21,158 --> 00:41:22,357
See you.

960
00:41:36,806 --> 00:41:37,906
Whoa.

961
00:41:37,908 --> 00:41:39,109
Show-off.

962
00:41:40,277 --> 00:41:42,844
Man, oh, man,
that place was scary.

963
00:41:42,846 --> 00:41:45,013
I know.
It was so exciting!

964
00:41:45,015 --> 00:41:46,915
No, exciting is
when you smile.

965
00:41:46,917 --> 00:41:48,649
Scary is when
you clench your butt,

966
00:41:48,651 --> 00:41:50,285
and my butt
is still clenched.

967
00:41:50,287 --> 00:41:52,320
Oh, come on, are you
honestly telling me...

968
00:41:52,322 --> 00:41:55,656
that Shank lady wasn't the
coolest person you ever met?

969
00:41:55,658 --> 00:41:58,160
Cool? Name one cool thing
about her.

970
00:41:58,162 --> 00:42:00,661
Um, let's see, she looks
cool, she talks cool...

971
00:42:00,663 --> 00:42:02,831
she drives cool, her hair
is cool, her car is cool...

972
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:05,000
Wait a minute, are you
saying my hair isn't cool?

973
00:42:05,002 --> 00:42:09,237
What? No! I'm just saying
the game was next-level.

974
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:11,840
There was no one telling you
what to do or where to go.

975
00:42:11,842 --> 00:42:14,176
Hey, just where do you think
you're going?

976
00:42:14,178 --> 00:42:16,078
To BuzzzTube.
It's this way.

977
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,346
No, no, no. We're going
back to Spamley's.

978
00:42:18,348 --> 00:42:20,348
He can give us
some easier loot to find.

979
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:23,185
No, we're supposed to
see Shank's friend.

980
00:42:23,187 --> 00:42:25,754
Oh, come on. I don't trust
that Shank one bit.

981
00:42:25,756 --> 00:42:27,956
- Well, I do.
- Well, I...

982
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:29,891
- Hello, mister.
- Who are you?

983
00:42:29,893 --> 00:42:31,793
I'm your friendly
ebay alert messenger.

984
00:42:31,795 --> 00:42:34,029
Huh. An actual eboy.

985
00:42:34,031 --> 00:42:37,399
Just here to let you know your
bid expires in eight hours.

986
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:40,702
Eight hours.
Okay, thanks, eboy.

987
00:42:40,704 --> 00:42:42,337
You got it, Jackson!

988
00:42:42,339 --> 00:42:46,241
Chumbo, if we nickel-and-dime
it with Spamley...

989
00:42:46,243 --> 00:42:48,076
it will take 20 years

990
00:42:48,078 --> 00:42:49,845
to make enough money
to buy the wheel.

991
00:42:49,847 --> 00:42:52,914
All right, fine.
We'll do it your way.

992
00:42:52,916 --> 00:42:54,749
But I'm telling you right now,
that BuzzzTube place

993
00:42:54,751 --> 00:42:56,053
is a terrible idea.

994
00:43:03,427 --> 00:43:06,895
Man, there are all kinds of
videos in here.

995
00:43:06,897 --> 00:43:09,364
Yeah, if you like
babies and cats.

996
00:43:09,366 --> 00:43:11,233
- Look, there's you!
- Oh, yeah.

997
00:43:11,235 --> 00:43:12,734
<i>I'm gonna wreck it!</i>

998
00:43:15,706 --> 00:43:17,105
I wonder
why those little guys

999
00:43:17,107 --> 00:43:18,874
are giving your video
all those hearts?

1000
00:43:18,876 --> 00:43:20,108
Because obviously
they love me.

1001
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:22,344
I told you this place
was a good idea.

1002
00:43:22,346 --> 00:43:24,212
Yeah,
sure you did, doof.

1003
00:43:24,214 --> 00:43:26,781
Now, who we supposed to see
about getting paid again?

1004
00:43:26,783 --> 00:43:30,085
The head algorithm.
Her name is Yesss.

1005
00:43:30,087 --> 00:43:32,122
No. No. No.

1006
00:43:32,756 --> 00:43:35,391
Uninspired, cliched...

1007
00:43:35,393 --> 00:43:37,292
Ugh! YouTube's got this one.

1008
00:43:37,294 --> 00:43:39,995
Chewbacca Dad? Really?

1009
00:43:39,997 --> 00:43:43,231
Yeah, it's like Chewbacca Mom,
but it's a daddy.

1010
00:43:43,233 --> 00:43:44,766
No!

1011
00:43:44,768 --> 00:43:47,869
Heyo! Are you
the head of Al Gore?

1012
00:43:47,871 --> 00:43:51,773
I am the head algorithm
of BuzzzTube...

1013
00:43:51,775 --> 00:43:53,476
which means
I curate the content...

1014
00:43:53,478 --> 00:43:56,345
at the Internet's most
popular video-sharing site.

1015
00:43:56,347 --> 00:43:58,113
Which means, I don't
have time to trifle...

1016
00:43:58,115 --> 00:44:00,749
with every shoeless,
mouth-breathing hobo

1017
00:44:00,751 --> 00:44:02,017
that trundles
into my office.

1018
00:44:02,019 --> 00:44:03,419
Call security, Maybe.

1019
00:44:03,421 --> 00:44:07,122
Yes. But, Yesss,
this is the leaf blower guy.

1020
00:44:07,124 --> 00:44:08,291
Who?

1021
00:44:08,293 --> 00:44:09,925
The man
with the undulating jowls.

1022
00:44:09,927 --> 00:44:11,327
So?

1023
00:44:11,329 --> 00:44:13,795
His video has
1.3 million hearts.

1024
00:44:13,797 --> 00:44:15,464
Well!

1025
00:44:15,466 --> 00:44:17,999
Why didn't you tell me

1026
00:44:18,001 --> 00:44:19,968
I was in the presence
of a genius?

1027
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:21,404
Grab him a drink.

1028
00:44:21,406 --> 00:44:23,004
Yeah, this lady
named Shank...

1029
00:44:23,006 --> 00:44:24,307
she actually made the video.

1030
00:44:24,309 --> 00:44:26,475
She's the one who told us
to come see you.

1031
00:44:26,477 --> 00:44:28,810
No wonder
your video's so dope.

1032
00:44:28,812 --> 00:44:30,446
Shank is for real cool.

1033
00:44:30,448 --> 00:44:31,813
Right?

1034
00:44:31,815 --> 00:44:33,182
She is not.

1035
00:44:33,184 --> 00:44:35,151
I'm the cool one
getting all the hearts.

1036
00:44:35,153 --> 00:44:38,154
Well, that's right,
you big baby.

1037
00:44:39,022 --> 00:44:40,189
Yeah.

1038
00:44:40,191 --> 00:44:41,357
Um, what'd you say
your name was?

1039
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,024
Ralph, Wreck-It Ralph.

1040
00:44:43,026 --> 00:44:46,295
Well, Wreck-It Ralph,
you are trending!

1041
00:44:46,297 --> 00:44:50,299
And these are for you. Hearts,
hearts, hearts, hearts.

1042
00:44:50,301 --> 00:44:51,900
- Hearts, hearts, hearts!
- Hearts, hearts, hearts!

1043
00:44:51,902 --> 00:44:53,034
Yes! Hearts!

1044
00:44:56,207 --> 00:44:58,040
Uh, not to buzzkill
the lovefest

1045
00:44:58,042 --> 00:44:59,808
you guys got going on here...

1046
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:01,377
but Shank kinda
told us that

1047
00:45:01,379 --> 00:45:04,846
viral videos can make,
like, actual money?

1048
00:45:04,848 --> 00:45:06,915
Oh, hearts are money, honey.

1049
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:09,118
Your Buzzzy account converts
hearts into dollars.

1050
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,486
Ka-ching!

1051
00:45:10,488 --> 00:45:12,321
$43,000!

1052
00:45:12,323 --> 00:45:15,291
Kid, we only needed $27,001.
We're done.

1053
00:45:15,293 --> 00:45:18,227
Oh, no, no, no.

1054
00:45:18,229 --> 00:45:20,196
That's $43.

1055
00:45:20,198 --> 00:45:24,233
43? That's not even
half of 27,001.

1056
00:45:24,235 --> 00:45:27,536
And we only have eight
hours left to save my game.

1057
00:45:27,538 --> 00:45:30,473
Ugh. Well, I hate to say it,
but that ain't happening.

1058
00:45:30,475 --> 00:45:32,174
Your video is tapped out.

1059
00:45:32,176 --> 00:45:33,609
But I thought
I was trenching?

1060
00:45:33,611 --> 00:45:35,144
Trending.

1061
00:45:35,146 --> 00:45:37,313
You were.
But that was 15 seconds ago.

1062
00:45:37,315 --> 00:45:39,282
Now, you're not.

1063
00:45:39,284 --> 00:45:40,084
Thanks for stopping by,
though.

1064
00:45:41,552 --> 00:45:43,152
Aw!

1065
00:45:43,154 --> 00:45:44,387
What are we gonna do, kid?

1066
00:45:44,389 --> 00:45:47,323
All right, pal, I have
an idea. And hear me out.

1067
00:45:47,325 --> 00:45:50,559
What if we go back
to <i>Slaughter Race</i>

1068
00:45:50,561 --> 00:45:51,761
and I ask Shank really...

1069
00:45:51,763 --> 00:45:56,098
No, no, no. We're not going
back to that death trap.

1070
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,334
Yesss, what if I made you
a whole bunch of videos...

1071
00:45:58,336 --> 00:46:00,970
of me doing all kinds of them
crazy things?

1072
00:46:00,972 --> 00:46:02,605
You mean
saturate the market?

1073
00:46:02,607 --> 00:46:05,107
That could get you
a lot of hearts fast.

1074
00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:06,342
Have you thought
this through at all?

1075
00:46:06,344 --> 00:46:09,145
What do you plan on even doing
in these videos?

1076
00:46:09,147 --> 00:46:11,447
I'll just copy
whatever's popular.

1077
00:46:11,449 --> 00:46:14,050
Genius. Yo, Maybe,
what's trending right now?

1078
00:46:14,052 --> 00:46:16,252
Mmm-hmm. Let's have
a lookie-lookie.

1079
00:46:16,254 --> 00:46:18,321
As usual, human suffering
is number one...

1080
00:46:18,323 --> 00:46:20,022
followed by hot pepper

1081
00:46:20,024 --> 00:46:21,290
eating challenges...

1082
00:46:21,292 --> 00:46:22,992
video game walkthroughs...

1083
00:46:22,994 --> 00:46:24,427
oh, screaming goats
are back...

1084
00:46:24,429 --> 00:46:27,530
unboxings, cooking demos,
makeup tutorials...

1085
00:46:27,532 --> 00:46:30,533
and lastly, ugh, bee puns.

1086
00:46:30,535 --> 00:46:33,071
<i>Let's "bee" friends.</i>

1087
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:36,405
Two weeks in a row, guys.

1088
00:46:36,407 --> 00:46:38,407
That's a fortnight
of bee puns.

1089
00:46:38,409 --> 00:46:41,243
He won't be doing any bee puns.
They're beneath you.

1090
00:46:41,245 --> 00:46:44,013
Oh, I'm doing a bee pun.
Oh, yes, I am.

1091
00:46:44,015 --> 00:46:46,982
And I'm eating a hot pepper,
and I'm putting on makeup...

1092
00:46:46,984 --> 00:46:48,417
and whatever else it takes!

1093
00:46:48,419 --> 00:46:51,120
Because, kid, we came here
to save your game

1094
00:46:51,122 --> 00:46:52,421
and we're gonna do it.

1095
00:46:52,423 --> 00:46:54,290
I love it! Ha!

1096
00:46:54,292 --> 00:46:56,092
That is what the Internet
was made for!

1097
00:46:56,094 --> 00:46:57,528
Now, let's get to work.

1098
00:47:00,098 --> 00:47:01,565
Seen it.

1099
00:47:01,567 --> 00:47:03,399
Saw that one.

1100
00:47:03,401 --> 00:47:05,436
Seen it. Seen it.

1101
00:47:06,471 --> 00:47:07,704
Huh?

1102
00:47:15,681 --> 00:47:18,180
Yo, McNeely,
you remember Wreck-It Ralph?

1103
00:47:18,182 --> 00:47:19,649
That bad guy
from the old video game?

1104
00:47:19,651 --> 00:47:21,685
Yeah, exactly.

1105
00:47:21,687 --> 00:47:22,985
I'm gonna send you
a super random video.

1106
00:47:22,987 --> 00:47:24,286
Check it out, dude.

1107
00:47:24,288 --> 00:47:25,591
Yeah, I'll give it a heart.
Whatever.

1108
00:47:36,635 --> 00:47:38,635
Hey, everybody, welcome to
<i>Up To the Meme-ent!</i>

1109
00:47:38,637 --> 00:47:40,169
I'm your host,
Dani Fernandez.

1110
00:47:40,171 --> 00:47:41,671
Nobody knows
who's making them,

1111
00:47:41,673 --> 00:47:43,440
but the whole world
is going bonkers...

1112
00:47:43,442 --> 00:47:46,142
over a series
of truly bizarre videos...

1113
00:47:46,144 --> 00:47:48,545
starring '80s-era bad guy
Wreck-It Ralph.

1114
00:47:48,547 --> 00:47:50,480
Check out what
everyone is buzzing about...

1115
00:47:50,482 --> 00:47:52,014
<i>over at BuzzzTube.com.</i>

1116
00:47:52,016 --> 00:47:53,650
<i>Hey, guys,
Wreck-It Ralph here...</i>

1117
00:47:53,652 --> 00:47:56,252
<i>with the ghost pepper
challenge.</i>

1118
00:47:56,254 --> 00:47:57,955
<i>Supposed to be spicy.
We'll see about that.</i>

1119
00:47:58,657 --> 00:48:00,222
<i>Mmm. That's not so...</i>

1120
00:48:00,224 --> 00:48:02,492
<i>Oh, it's very hot!
Oh, make it stop!</i>

1121
00:48:02,494 --> 00:48:04,294
Yo, McNeely,
another one just dropped.

1122
00:48:04,296 --> 00:48:05,429
Check it out, dude.

1123
00:48:05,431 --> 00:48:07,397
Where are these things
coming from?

1124
00:48:07,399 --> 00:48:08,532
Hey, Josey,

1125
00:48:08,534 --> 00:48:09,633
did you see
the pepper challenge?

1126
00:48:09,635 --> 00:48:10,734
Oh, not yet.

1127
00:48:10,736 --> 00:48:13,202
I'm watching the one
where he just smacks his lips.

1128
00:48:13,204 --> 00:48:14,571
It's disgusting.

1129
00:48:14,573 --> 00:48:16,038
<i>You don't want
any real hard lines.</i>

1130
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,475
<i>You just want to blend that
out there, like this...</i>

1131
00:48:18,477 --> 00:48:20,377
<i>And that, my friends,</i>

1132
00:48:20,379 --> 00:48:23,213
<i>is how you achieve
the perfect cat eye.</i>

1133
00:48:23,215 --> 00:48:24,314
<i>I always start</i>

1134
00:48:24,316 --> 00:48:27,717
<i>with the hootnanny.
Shift it into a floss.</i>

1135
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:31,086
<i>And now I finish with
a hot Marat. Huh? Huh?</i>

1136
00:48:31,088 --> 00:48:32,622
<i>Follow along with me,</i>

1137
00:48:32,624 --> 00:48:36,393
<i>and I'm gonna give this little
cloud a little friend...</i>

1138
00:48:36,395 --> 00:48:38,161
<i>in the form of a tree.</i>

1139
00:48:38,163 --> 00:48:39,465
<i>Everybody needs a friend.</i>

1140
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,599
<i>Look at these guys.</i>

1141
00:48:42,601 --> 00:48:44,568
<i>Look at this one,
sleeping under his ear.</i>

1142
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:46,770
<i>You couch potatoes.
Wake up.</i>

1143
00:48:46,772 --> 00:48:49,739
<i>We've been baking
at about 950 degrees</i>

1144
00:48:49,741 --> 00:48:51,241
<i>now for six hours...</i>

1145
00:48:51,243 --> 00:48:52,742
<i>so she should be ready.</i>

1146
00:48:54,112 --> 00:48:57,113
<i>Voila! Burnt pie!</i>

1147
00:48:57,115 --> 00:48:58,582
<i>Let's have a little whiff</i>
<i>of this here.</i>

1148
00:48:58,584 --> 00:49:00,452
<i>My hair,</i>
<i>my hair! My hair!</i>

1149
00:49:01,286 --> 00:49:03,320
This man is on fire.

1150
00:49:03,322 --> 00:49:05,422
Literal and figurative fire.

1151
00:49:05,424 --> 00:49:07,290
But he still needs
200 million hearts

1152
00:49:07,292 --> 00:49:08,725
in the next five hours...

1153
00:49:08,727 --> 00:49:10,727
or this beautiful child
loses her game.

1154
00:49:10,729 --> 00:49:13,230
That's why
I'm on to phase two...

1155
00:49:13,232 --> 00:49:15,732
you, my elite Pop-Up Army.

1156
00:49:15,734 --> 00:49:17,834
I need you out there
popping up...

1157
00:49:17,836 --> 00:49:20,337
and getting clicks
all over the Internet.

1158
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:23,240
I'm talking Tumblr,
Instagram, Mashable.

1159
00:49:23,242 --> 00:49:24,641
Be my pied pipers and

1160
00:49:24,643 --> 00:49:27,310
lead that beautiful traffic
to BuzzzTube...

1161
00:49:27,312 --> 00:49:29,548
because Wreck-It Ralph
needs his hearts.

1162
00:49:33,819 --> 00:49:36,152
Hey, mister! Hey, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, you, you.

1163
00:49:36,154 --> 00:49:37,621
You don't wanna miss this.

1164
00:49:37,623 --> 00:49:38,655
It's the latest
Wreck-It Ralph video.

1165
00:49:38,657 --> 00:49:40,225
Click it. Click it!

1166
00:49:52,571 --> 00:49:55,605
Man oh Manischewitz,
that looks so fun.

1167
00:49:55,607 --> 00:49:56,841
Yesss, can I be a pop-up?

1168
00:49:56,843 --> 00:49:59,476
I don't know. Can you be
annoyingly aggressive?

1169
00:49:59,478 --> 00:50:02,312
I don't know.
Can I? Can I? Can I?

1170
00:50:02,314 --> 00:50:04,516
Can I? Can I? Can I?
Can I? Can I? Can I?

1171
00:50:05,584 --> 00:50:07,684
Oh, yes, you're perfect. Here.

1172
00:50:07,686 --> 00:50:09,286
Thank you!

1173
00:50:09,288 --> 00:50:10,420
If you're going, I wanna go.

1174
00:50:10,422 --> 00:50:13,858
No, baby, you've got to stay
here and be my movie star.

1175
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:17,160
What? No, no, no. Me and the
kid are like shoes and socks.

1176
00:50:17,162 --> 00:50:18,528
Or peanut butter and bacon.

1177
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:20,330
One cannot exist
without the other.

1178
00:50:20,332 --> 00:50:21,598
Go on, kid, tell her.

1179
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,566
It's true.

1180
00:50:22,568 --> 00:50:26,136
In fact, it's so true
that we will be fine

1181
00:50:26,138 --> 00:50:28,204
if we're apart
for a minute.

1182
00:50:28,206 --> 00:50:30,708
Come on, pal. It's my game
we're trying to save.

1183
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:32,311
I just wanna get out there
and be useful.

1184
00:50:33,145 --> 00:50:34,344
But without me?

1185
00:50:34,346 --> 00:50:36,379
What if you get lost?
You're just a kid.

1186
00:50:36,381 --> 00:50:38,548
Oh, and you're
some mature adult?

1187
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:40,550
Well, I'm bigger.

1188
00:50:40,552 --> 00:50:42,485
Don't be insecure,
big fella.

1189
00:50:42,487 --> 00:50:44,789
She's not gonna get lost.
I promise.

1190
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:47,559
She'll be in
my personal web browser.

1191
00:50:48,861 --> 00:50:51,194
And your app comes
with BuzzzFace...

1192
00:50:51,196 --> 00:50:53,396
so you can keep in touch
anywhere on the Internet.

1193
00:50:53,398 --> 00:50:55,231
See, I'll be fine.

1194
00:50:55,233 --> 00:50:57,135
I know, I just...

1195
00:51:00,907 --> 00:51:03,774
We haven't been apart
in like six years.

1196
00:51:03,776 --> 00:51:05,678
I'm going to miss you.

1197
00:51:06,311 --> 00:51:08,579
You'll be fine, too.

1198
00:51:08,581 --> 00:51:10,347
The more hearts
your videos get,

1199
00:51:10,349 --> 00:51:12,315
the faster
we'll get the wheel.

1200
00:51:12,317 --> 00:51:13,918
And then we can go home.

1201
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,452
Look, we'll be celebrating

1202
00:51:15,454 --> 00:51:17,688
at Tapper's this time
tomorrow, buddy.

1203
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:20,593
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1204
00:51:21,226 --> 00:51:22,860
Bye!

1205
00:51:22,862 --> 00:51:25,696
Be careful, huh?
Don't be a dummy.

1206
00:51:29,602 --> 00:51:31,602
So where exactly
are you sending her?

1207
00:51:31,604 --> 00:51:33,871
Since candy girl
comes from an arcade game...

1208
00:51:33,873 --> 00:51:35,541
I'm thinking she'd be good
in the gaming district.

1209
00:51:37,309 --> 00:51:38,943
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Bad idea.

1210
00:51:38,945 --> 00:51:41,579
Those games are dangerous,
and they rot your brain.

1211
00:51:41,581 --> 00:51:42,880
Why don't we
send her somewhere

1212
00:51:42,882 --> 00:51:45,549
a little more totally
different than that...

1213
00:51:45,551 --> 00:51:47,952
and nowhere near there?

1214
00:51:47,954 --> 00:51:51,221
Let's see.
Family Friendly Fansites.

1215
00:51:51,223 --> 00:51:53,457
That sounds safe, and she is
technically a princess...

1216
00:51:53,459 --> 00:51:55,493
so how about this one here

1217
00:51:55,495 --> 00:51:56,927
with the sweet little
pink castle?

1218
00:51:56,929 --> 00:51:58,095
I love it.

1219
00:51:58,097 --> 00:52:02,001
Okay, I'll redirect our newest
pop-up to OhMyDisney.com.

1220
00:52:07,774 --> 00:52:10,943
Jeez Louise, this place
is bonkers! Whoa!

1221
00:52:16,248 --> 00:52:18,685
To infinity and beyond!

1222
00:52:22,255 --> 00:52:25,489
Aw, come on. Princesses
and cartoon characters?

1223
00:52:25,491 --> 00:52:26,957
Lame.

1224
00:52:26,959 --> 00:52:29,660
Hey, easy there.

1225
00:52:29,662 --> 00:52:31,864
Oh, I mean,
no offense or anything.

1226
00:52:32,799 --> 00:52:34,965
Well, time to get to work.

1227
00:52:34,967 --> 00:52:36,500
And for your final question.

1228
00:52:36,502 --> 00:52:39,570
"My friends
would describe me as?"

1229
00:52:39,572 --> 00:52:42,673
<i>"Smart, funny,
kind, or brave."</i>

1230
00:52:42,675 --> 00:52:43,676
<i>Um...</i>

1231
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:46,777
Kind, I guess?

1232
00:52:46,779 --> 00:52:50,815
Based on your answers,
your princess BFF is

1233
00:52:50,817 --> 00:52:52,616
Snow White!

1234
00:52:52,618 --> 00:52:54,018
I do believe our friendship

1235
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,020
will be the fairest
of them all!

1236
00:52:56,022 --> 00:52:59,356
Hey, wanna meet my BFF?
It's Wreck-It Ralph.

1237
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:01,358
Just click here
to see his new video.

1238
00:53:02,495 --> 00:53:04,295
Thank you.

1239
00:53:04,297 --> 00:53:06,931
<i>Yeah, um, in</i> Captain America:
The First Avenger...

1240
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,833
<i>Red Skull refers to Yggdrasil,</i>

1241
00:53:08,835 --> 00:53:11,001
<i>the World Tree,
Guardian of Wisdom and Fate.</i>

1242
00:53:11,003 --> 00:53:12,870
<i>Are we to believe, sir,</i>

1243
00:53:12,872 --> 00:53:14,474
<i>that you are a descendant
of that tree?</i>

1244
00:53:15,441 --> 00:53:17,341
I am Groot.

1245
00:53:17,343 --> 00:53:19,376
<i>Okay, okay.
Thank you very much.</i>

1246
00:53:19,378 --> 00:53:21,545
<i>Um, what is Drax really like?</i>

1247
00:53:21,547 --> 00:53:23,048
- I am Groot.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

1248
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:26,383
<i>Yeah. Are you a conifer
or a fruit-bearing tree?</i>

1249
00:53:26,385 --> 00:53:27,451
- I...
- Excuse me.

1250
00:53:27,453 --> 00:53:28,519
I'll take this one.
He is Groot,

1251
00:53:28,521 --> 00:53:29,620
I am Vanellope,

1252
00:53:29,622 --> 00:53:30,923
click here
to meet Wreck-It Ralph.

1253
00:53:32,358 --> 00:53:35,526
Eh, this is almost too easy.

1254
00:53:35,528 --> 00:53:36,927
<i>Hey, do you
have a permit for that pop-up?</i>

1255
00:53:36,929 --> 00:53:38,362
Uh...

1256
00:53:38,364 --> 00:53:40,865
<i>That's unauthorized clickbait.
You're coming with us, kid.</i>

1257
00:53:40,867 --> 00:53:42,733
Boop!

1258
00:53:42,735 --> 00:53:43,870
<i>She's getting away.</i>

1259
00:53:46,539 --> 00:53:47,540
<i>This way.</i>

1260
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:49,107
Ooh!

1261
00:53:49,109 --> 00:53:50,309
Sorry, mister!

1262
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:56,882
Hey, can't you read?
Cast members only!

1263
00:53:58,886 --> 00:54:00,351
<i>I think she
went down this way. Come on.</i>

1264
00:54:00,353 --> 00:54:01,685
<i>Roger that.</i>

1265
00:54:01,687 --> 00:54:02,820
<i>Did you see
a kid come through here?</i>

1266
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:05,556
She came running through here
like a headless hen.

1267
00:54:07,693 --> 00:54:08,592
<i>Any sign of her?</i>

1268
00:54:08,594 --> 00:54:10,594
<i>No, maybe she went down</i>

1269
00:54:10,596 --> 00:54:11,897
<i>to the</i> Air Bud <i>pavilion.</i>

1270
00:54:11,899 --> 00:54:13,499
<i>Come on. Let's check it out.</i>

1271
00:54:20,773 --> 00:54:21,907
Uh, hi!

1272
00:54:25,813 --> 00:54:27,779
Whoa, whoa.
Ladies, I can explain.

1273
00:54:27,781 --> 00:54:30,749
See, I'm a princess, too.

1274
00:54:30,751 --> 00:54:32,583
- Wait, what?
- Yeah.

1275
00:54:32,585 --> 00:54:34,618
Princess Vanellope
Von Schweetz...

1276
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:37,555
of the, uh, <i>Sugar Rush</i>
Von Schweetzes.

1277
00:54:37,557 --> 00:54:38,857
I'm sure you've heard of us.

1278
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:41,059
It'd be embarrassing for you
if you haven't.

1279
00:54:41,962 --> 00:54:44,528
Huh. What kind of
a princess are you?

1280
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:45,697
What kind?

1281
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,531
- Do you have magic hair?
- No.

1282
00:54:47,533 --> 00:54:49,134
- Magic hands?
- No.

1283
00:54:49,136 --> 00:54:51,402
- Do animals talk to you?
- No.

1284
00:54:51,404 --> 00:54:52,536
- Were you poisoned?
- No!

1285
00:54:52,538 --> 00:54:53,805
- Cursed?
- No!

1286
00:54:53,807 --> 00:54:55,506
- Kidnapped or enslaved?
- No!

1287
00:54:55,508 --> 00:54:57,108
Are you guys okay?
Should I call the police?

1288
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:58,643
Then I have to assume
you made a deal

1289
00:54:58,645 --> 00:55:00,045
with an underwater
sea witch...

1290
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:00,946
where she took your voice

1291
00:55:00,948 --> 00:55:03,447
in exchange
for a pair of human legs?

1292
00:55:03,449 --> 00:55:05,817
No! Good Lord,
who would do that?

1293
00:55:05,819 --> 00:55:07,418
Have you ever had
True Love's Kiss?

1294
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:08,687
Ew! Barf!

1295
00:55:08,689 --> 00:55:09,821
Do you have daddy issues?

1296
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,089
I don't even have a mom.

1297
00:55:11,091 --> 00:55:12,891
Neither do we!

1298
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:15,426
And now for
the million-dollar question.

1299
00:55:15,428 --> 00:55:17,929
Do people assume
all your problems got solved

1300
00:55:17,931 --> 00:55:19,831
because a big strong man
showed up?

1301
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:21,967
Yes! What is up with that?

1302
00:55:21,969 --> 00:55:23,568
She is a princess!

1303
00:55:24,972 --> 00:55:26,671
Who made your gown?

1304
00:55:26,673 --> 00:55:28,505
I've never seen
anything quite like it.

1305
00:55:28,507 --> 00:55:29,808
Oh, this old thing?

1306
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:31,676
Oh, I'd so love to
have one of my own.

1307
00:55:31,678 --> 00:55:32,777
- As would I.
- Me too!

1308
00:55:32,779 --> 00:55:34,579
- So cool.
- Best outfit ever!

1309
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:35,747
Ooh! I want one, too,
you guys!

1310
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,150
I'll get my mice on this.

1311
00:55:40,187 --> 00:55:42,654
So this is love.

1312
00:55:42,656 --> 00:55:47,025
All hail Princess Vanellope,
the queen of comfy!

1313
00:55:47,027 --> 00:55:48,994
Yay, Vanellope!

1314
00:55:48,996 --> 00:55:51,796
Of all the thingamabobs
in this entire world...

1315
00:55:51,798 --> 00:55:53,965
I never thought
I'd get to wear a real...

1316
00:55:53,967 --> 00:55:55,467
what's it called again?

1317
00:55:55,469 --> 00:55:57,903
Oh, yeah. Shirt.

1318
00:55:57,905 --> 00:56:01,806
<i>♪ I once had a dream
that I might wear a shirt... ♪</i>

1319
00:56:01,808 --> 00:56:04,509
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait! What's going on?

1320
00:56:04,511 --> 00:56:06,011
Uh, she's singing.

1321
00:56:06,013 --> 00:56:09,180
Yeah, but there was like music
and a spotlight.

1322
00:56:09,182 --> 00:56:11,016
Wait, you all
saw it too, right?

1323
00:56:11,018 --> 00:56:12,217
That's what happens

1324
00:56:12,219 --> 00:56:14,519
when a princess
sings about her dreams.

1325
00:56:14,521 --> 00:56:17,822
Oh, that's never happened
to me. I mean, not even once.

1326
00:56:17,824 --> 00:56:19,724
Why don't you give it
a try?

1327
00:56:19,726 --> 00:56:22,694
What is it you really want?
Sing about that.

1328
00:56:22,696 --> 00:56:24,162
Okay. Uh, sure.

1329
00:56:24,164 --> 00:56:25,899
Huh. I could do that.
Um, let's see.

1330
00:56:28,068 --> 00:56:32,704
<i>♪ Oh, steering wheel
Oh, steering wheel</i>

1331
00:56:32,706 --> 00:56:36,141
<i>♪ Oh, yes
I want a steering wheel ♪</i>

1332
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,513
Well, there is a lot
to unpack here.

1333
00:56:41,515 --> 00:56:42,847
Mmm-hmm.

1334
00:56:42,849 --> 00:56:45,183
So, this steering wheel
you sing of,

1335
00:56:45,185 --> 00:56:46,785
that's a metaphor?

1336
00:56:46,787 --> 00:56:48,987
Oh, no, no, no, it's not
a metaphor. I just...

1337
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:51,589
I literally want
a steering wheel.

1338
00:56:51,591 --> 00:56:53,792
I think the issue is
I was a little pitchy.

1339
00:56:53,794 --> 00:56:55,227
Maybe a little.

1340
00:56:55,229 --> 00:56:58,630
But sometimes
your song can't start...

1341
00:56:58,632 --> 00:57:00,767
until you go someplace
to reflect.

1342
00:57:01,768 --> 00:57:03,235
What works for some of us...

1343
00:57:03,237 --> 00:57:06,840
is finding a form of water
and staring at it.

1344
00:57:07,541 --> 00:57:08,873
What?

1345
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:11,210
Oh, yes, I like to stare
at a wishing well!

1346
00:57:11,212 --> 00:57:12,610
I stare at the ocean.

1347
00:57:12,612 --> 00:57:13,778
Horse trough.

1348
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:14,913
Soap bubbles!

1349
00:57:14,915 --> 00:57:17,617
Wait, you're saying if I just
stare at some water...

1350
00:57:18,286 --> 00:57:20,086
Uh, important water.

1351
00:57:20,088 --> 00:57:22,921
Right. Of course.
"Important water."

1352
00:57:22,923 --> 00:57:25,257
I stare at
the important water...

1353
00:57:25,259 --> 00:57:28,593
and somehow magically I'll
start singing about my dream?

1354
00:57:28,595 --> 00:57:29,661
- For sure.
- Mmm-hmm.

1355
00:57:29,663 --> 00:57:32,264
Uh, yeah, I don't think so,
ladies, but thanks.

1356
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,667
Five minutes,
Princesses.

1357
00:57:35,669 --> 00:57:38,270
Another "Which Disney Princess
Are You?" quizlet

1358
00:57:38,272 --> 00:57:39,971
starts in five minutes.

1359
00:57:39,973 --> 00:57:42,274
Okay, thank you.

1360
00:57:42,276 --> 00:57:45,311
Well, I guess it's back
to the gowns, girls.

1361
00:57:45,313 --> 00:57:47,579
It was lovely to meet you,
Vanellope.

1362
00:57:47,581 --> 00:57:49,714
And best of luck
finding your song.

1363
00:57:56,257 --> 00:57:57,990
Uh-huh.

1364
00:57:57,992 --> 00:57:59,291
What did she just say?

1365
00:57:59,293 --> 00:58:01,227
We don't know.
We can't understand her.

1366
00:58:01,229 --> 00:58:02,928
She's from
the other studio.

1367
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:04,662
Ah.

1368
00:58:04,664 --> 00:58:06,865
Hi, everybody.
Wreck-It Ralph here...

1369
00:58:06,867 --> 00:58:09,601
with a little box
I'm gonna open.

1370
00:58:09,603 --> 00:58:11,070
Let's see what we got here.

1371
00:58:11,072 --> 00:58:14,373
A "Pancake Milkshake
Fun Set." Huh.

1372
00:58:14,375 --> 00:58:15,875
Got a little heft to it.

1373
00:58:15,877 --> 00:58:17,675
Something wobbling
around in there.

1374
00:58:17,677 --> 00:58:19,145
Wonder if we got
the kitty or the bunny.

1375
00:58:19,147 --> 00:58:20,279
Let's open it up.

1376
00:58:24,718 --> 00:58:26,018
Man, who would've
guessed a bee pun

1377
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:28,287
would be the thing
to put us over the top?

1378
00:58:28,289 --> 00:58:30,089
Huh. That's the Internet
for you.

1379
00:58:30,091 --> 00:58:33,092
All right, it is uploading.

1380
00:58:33,094 --> 00:58:34,326
Hey, mister!

1381
00:58:34,328 --> 00:58:35,693
Oh. Hi, eboy.

1382
00:58:35,695 --> 00:58:36,962
Just here to let you know

1383
00:58:36,964 --> 00:58:39,697
your bid does expire
in 30 minutes.

1384
00:58:39,699 --> 00:58:41,767
Thanks, little eboy.

1385
00:58:41,769 --> 00:58:42,770
You got it, chairman.

1386
00:58:43,371 --> 00:58:44,702
You hear that, Yesss?

1387
00:58:44,704 --> 00:58:46,172
We don't have
a lot of time left.

1388
00:58:46,174 --> 00:58:47,339
Okay. We just gotta...

1389
00:58:47,341 --> 00:58:49,674
No, no, no.

1390
00:58:49,676 --> 00:58:51,377
No! Not you!

1391
00:58:51,379 --> 00:58:53,045
What? Why are you
angry at the lollipop?

1392
00:58:53,047 --> 00:58:54,213
What does that mean?

1393
00:58:54,215 --> 00:58:55,815
The file's not loading.

1394
00:58:55,817 --> 00:58:57,750
If this doesn't load,
we're not gonna make it.

1395
00:58:57,752 --> 00:59:00,652
- Hmm.
- You don't have enough hearts.

1396
00:59:00,654 --> 00:59:02,021
Ralph, where are you going?

1397
00:59:02,023 --> 00:59:03,257
I'm going down to the floor
to get some hearts.

1398
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:05,191
Ah! Genius! Good thinking.

1399
00:59:05,193 --> 00:59:07,860
Now, someone get me
tech support in here, stat!

1400
00:59:11,332 --> 00:59:13,232
Only one person.

1401
00:59:13,234 --> 00:59:14,733
Hey, guys, come and
check out my video,

1402
00:59:14,735 --> 00:59:15,668
you're gonna love it.

1403
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:18,704
Right, right over here.
Yep, here we go.

1404
00:59:18,706 --> 00:59:20,339
What are you...
You guys!

1405
00:59:20,341 --> 00:59:22,241
Aw. A cat?

1406
00:59:22,243 --> 00:59:26,147
You're gonna like this better
than some dusty old cat.

1407
00:59:27,081 --> 00:59:28,214
Aw.

1408
00:59:28,216 --> 00:59:29,348
What?

1409
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:31,317
Give me that hose, partner.

1410
00:59:31,319 --> 00:59:34,787
You know you love me, give me those hearts.
There we go.

1411
00:59:34,789 --> 00:59:37,389
Hey, folks, where are you going?
Give my video a heart.

1412
00:59:37,391 --> 00:59:40,027
That's it.
Let's see who's in here.

1413
00:59:40,728 --> 00:59:41,729
Hello?

1414
00:59:42,997 --> 00:59:44,232
Anybody in here?

1415
00:59:47,101 --> 00:59:49,036
What the heck is this place?

1416
00:59:50,771 --> 00:59:52,306
Some kind of libary?

1417
00:59:53,941 --> 00:59:56,041
"Wreck-It Ralph is back."

1418
00:59:56,043 --> 00:59:58,744
Hey, they're talking about me.

1419
00:59:58,746 --> 01:00:01,814
Gee whiz,
the Internet is so positive.

1420
01:00:01,816 --> 01:00:04,350
<i>"Fix-It Felix, Jr.</i>
was my favorite game."

1421
01:00:04,352 --> 01:00:06,118
Hmm. Mine, too.

1422
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:08,156
"Ralph's videos stink."

1423
01:00:08,956 --> 01:00:10,089
What?

1424
01:00:10,091 --> 01:00:12,124
"So stupid."

1425
01:00:12,126 --> 01:00:14,262
"Ralph is the worst."

1426
01:00:15,363 --> 01:00:17,165
"I hate him."

1427
01:00:17,965 --> 01:00:20,768
"He's so fat and ugly."

1428
01:00:23,004 --> 01:00:27,342
"Just a worthless bum,
alone on a pile of bricks."

1429
01:00:34,449 --> 01:00:37,216
Yo, Ralph,
you in here, dude?

1430
01:00:37,218 --> 01:00:38,819
Hey, I got to show you...

1431
01:00:40,087 --> 01:00:41,122
Oh.

1432
01:00:42,023 --> 01:00:44,123
First rule
of the Internet...

1433
01:00:44,125 --> 01:00:47,026
do not read the comments.

1434
01:00:47,028 --> 01:00:48,263
I should have told you that.

1435
01:00:49,398 --> 01:00:50,530
Look.

1436
01:00:50,532 --> 01:00:53,832
This place can bring out
the worst in some people...

1437
01:00:53,834 --> 01:00:55,435
but you gotta ignore all this.

1438
01:00:55,437 --> 01:00:58,837
This isn't about you, Ralph.
It's about them.

1439
01:00:58,839 --> 01:01:00,839
I don't care.
It's fine.

1440
01:01:02,444 --> 01:01:05,314
People hated me my whole life
for being the bad guy.

1441
01:01:06,448 --> 01:01:08,047
It's just a good reminder

1442
01:01:08,049 --> 01:01:09,416
that this is the only heart

1443
01:01:09,418 --> 01:01:10,252
that really matters.

1444
01:01:11,118 --> 01:01:12,851
Vanellope gave me this...

1445
01:01:12,853 --> 01:01:14,287
and as long as she likes me...

1446
01:01:14,289 --> 01:01:16,122
I don't need anybody else.

1447
01:01:16,124 --> 01:01:17,790
And I sure
don't need the Internet.

1448
01:01:17,792 --> 01:01:19,259
Hold on.

1449
01:01:19,261 --> 01:01:21,294
It's not all bad.

1450
01:01:21,296 --> 01:01:23,296
The Internet
can also be a place...

1451
01:01:23,298 --> 01:01:25,798
where you find a steering
wheel at one website...

1452
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:29,135
and make enough money
to buy it at another one.

1453
01:01:29,137 --> 01:01:31,271
Congratulations, Ralph.
You did it.

1454
01:01:31,273 --> 01:01:32,539
Wait, really?

1455
01:01:32,541 --> 01:01:34,907
Yes, check your
Buzzzy account.

1456
01:01:34,909 --> 01:01:37,876
You needed 27K,
you got over 30 grand!

1457
01:01:37,878 --> 01:01:39,112
Oh, my gosh!

1458
01:01:39,114 --> 01:01:40,547
This is great!

1459
01:01:40,549 --> 01:01:42,482
Thank you, Yesss. I couldn't
have done it without you!

1460
01:01:42,484 --> 01:01:43,882
That's really true.

1461
01:01:43,884 --> 01:01:45,318
Hey, eboy?

1462
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:46,885
What do you need, ace?

1463
01:01:46,887 --> 01:01:48,455
Can you give me a ride?

1464
01:01:48,457 --> 01:01:50,525
Let's hop along, Cassidy.

1465
01:01:51,892 --> 01:01:54,263
Come on, song, come on.

1466
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:56,831
I'm reflecting.

1467
01:01:57,466 --> 01:01:58,831
What is it that I want?

1468
01:01:58,833 --> 01:02:00,200
What is my quest?

1469
01:02:00,202 --> 01:02:02,170
What is my dream?

1470
01:02:04,406 --> 01:02:06,839
Well, ladies, I tried.

1471
01:02:06,841 --> 01:02:09,309
No song for this princess,
I guess.

1472
01:02:09,311 --> 01:02:11,246
Ooh! Huh.

1473
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,847
How does this thing work?

1474
01:02:14,849 --> 01:02:16,249
<i>Hey, kid, can you see me?</i>

1475
01:02:16,251 --> 01:02:18,151
Yeah! Yeah,
you're right there.

1476
01:02:18,153 --> 01:02:20,253
<i>We did it! We got the money!</i>

1477
01:02:20,255 --> 01:02:22,589
No way, Ralph!
That's great!

1478
01:02:22,591 --> 01:02:25,091
I'm on my way to ebay
right now with the eboy.

1479
01:02:25,093 --> 01:02:26,359
We're almost there, champ.

1480
01:02:26,361 --> 01:02:27,494
Good work, eboy.

1481
01:02:27,496 --> 01:02:29,929
Hey, meet me out in front of
ebay in five minutes, okay?

1482
01:02:29,931 --> 01:02:31,498
<i>Okay, I'll see you soon.</i>

1483
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,366
We're going home, kid!

1484
01:02:33,368 --> 01:02:35,535
<i>Our lives can finally
get back to normal.</i>

1485
01:02:35,537 --> 01:02:36,505
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

1486
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:42,108
Wow, I can't believe it.
I get to go home.

1487
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:43,510
So, I guess that's it.

1488
01:02:43,512 --> 01:02:46,581
I guess I just wanted a...
a steering wheel.

1489
01:02:47,516 --> 01:02:49,949
And now, I got it, so...

1490
01:02:49,951 --> 01:02:51,253
whoo-hoo.

Oh, hey, Spamley.

What's the good word,
brother?

1547
01:06:30,172 --> 01:06:32,606
Well, the good word is I just
paid for the steering wheel...

1548
01:06:32,608 --> 01:06:34,141
and we are going home.

01:06:34,143 --> 01:06:35,242

01:06:35,244 --> 01:06:36,510
Thanks.

Hey, have you seen
Vanellope anywhere?

Oh, uh, your little chum?
Uh, no, no, I haven't.

1553
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:42,783
Hope she's not lost.

1554
01:06:42,785 --> 01:06:44,720
Let me try to reach her
on this doohickey.

1555
01:06:55,398 --> 01:06:57,298
See over there?
Over that mountain?

1556
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,533
- Yeah.
- That's the Sequoia Speedway.

<i>It's gonna be unlocked
next month.</i>

1558

Hey, what are you doing
in that awful game with her?

1559
01:07:03,172 --> 01:07:04,705
<i>I think
the track will end...</i>

1560
01:07:04,707 --> 01:07:07,308
right over there. Yo,
it's gonna be so tight.

1561
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:09,343
Oh, I love it.

1562
01:07:09,345 --> 01:07:10,644
Hey, can I tell you something

1563
01:07:10,646 --> 01:07:12,881
that I don't think
I could ever tell Ralph?

1564
01:07:12,883 --> 01:07:14,315
Of course.

1565
01:07:14,317 --> 01:07:15,850
I know it sounds crazy...

1566
01:07:15,852 --> 01:07:19,355
but the second I walked
into this game, it felt...

1567
01:07:20,222 --> 01:07:22,423
Well, it felt like home.

1568
01:07:22,425 --> 01:07:24,793
I mean, more than
<i>Sugar Rush</i> ever did.

1569
01:07:24,795 --> 01:07:26,795
Oh, yeah? How so?

1570
01:07:26,797 --> 01:07:28,629
'Cause it's like my dream.

1571
01:07:28,631 --> 01:07:30,832
It's full of weirdos...

1572
01:07:30,834 --> 01:07:34,201
and the racing
is super dangerous...

1573
01:07:34,203 --> 01:07:36,539
and you never know
what's gonna happen next.

1574
01:07:37,406 --> 01:07:38,707
I mean, back home,

1575
01:07:38,709 --> 01:07:41,175
I know exactly
what's gonna happen next...

1576
01:07:41,177 --> 01:07:44,180
because Ralph's dream is to
do the same thing every day.

1577
01:07:46,349 --> 01:07:47,483
Hmm.

1578
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:53,220
Here's something
I wish I'd learned years ago.

1579
01:07:53,222 --> 01:07:54,889
There is no law

1580
01:07:54,891 --> 01:07:58,325
saying best friends
have to have the same dreams.

1581
01:07:58,327 --> 01:07:59,328
You know?

1582
01:07:59,763 --> 01:08:00,895
Whoa.

1583
01:08:00,897 --> 01:08:02,564
Yeah.

1584
01:08:02,566 --> 01:08:05,934
You are a very
wise person, Shank.

1585
01:08:05,936 --> 01:08:08,335
And a good friend, too.

1586
01:08:08,337 --> 01:08:09,704
Thank you.

1587
01:08:09,706 --> 01:08:11,873
Around here, peeps like
to say, "Shank you."

1588
01:08:13,577 --> 01:08:15,510
You know,
after you go home

1589
01:08:15,512 --> 01:08:17,411
and your life
gets back to normal...

1590
01:08:17,413 --> 01:08:19,380
you are always
welcome here.

1591
01:08:19,382 --> 01:08:22,383
But that's the thing,
I want this to be my normal.

1592
01:08:22,385 --> 01:08:24,454
I want this to be my life.

1593
01:08:25,287 --> 01:08:26,657
I can't go home now.

1594
01:08:28,692 --> 01:08:29,926
I just can't.

1595
01:08:38,267 --> 01:08:39,268
Wow.

1596
01:08:40,302 --> 01:08:41,403
You know,
where I come from,

1597
01:08:41,405 --> 01:08:43,705
that's called
a kick in the face.

1598
01:08:43,707 --> 01:08:45,640
I can't believe it.

1599
01:08:45,642 --> 01:08:48,610
A straight-up donkey kick
to the teeth.

1600
01:08:48,612 --> 01:08:50,614
She's supposed to be
my best friend.

1601
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,683
No, this can't be right.

1602
01:08:53,984 --> 01:08:55,817
No, she's been brainwashed.

1603
01:08:55,819 --> 01:08:57,318
That's what this is.

1604
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,353
Because the Vanellope I know

1605
01:08:58,355 --> 01:08:59,788
would never abandon me
like that.

1606
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:01,556
I gotta get her out
of there now.

1607
01:09:01,558 --> 01:09:03,825
Hey, easy now, tiger.

1608
01:09:03,827 --> 01:09:04,959
I admire the impulse...

1609
01:09:04,961 --> 01:09:07,495
but you charge in there
like some white knight...

1610
01:09:07,497 --> 01:09:08,997
she's liable to hold it
against you.

1611
01:09:08,999 --> 01:09:11,433
So what? I'm supposed to
just let her stay in a game

1612
01:09:11,435 --> 01:09:12,567
that's obviously bad for her?

1613
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:13,768
Of course not.

1614
01:09:13,770 --> 01:09:15,704
Then how do I make her leave?

1615
01:09:15,706 --> 01:09:18,807
She thinks it's so cool
and exciting in there.

1616
01:09:18,809 --> 01:09:22,677
Unless you know how I can
make the game boring or...

1617
01:09:22,679 --> 01:09:26,481
Wait. You know about viruses
and stuff, right, Spamley?

1618
01:09:26,483 --> 01:09:28,450
- Who's asking?
- Whoa.

1619
01:09:28,452 --> 01:09:29,784
Back home, me and the kid

1620
01:09:29,786 --> 01:09:32,387
used to goof off
in this game called <i>Tron.</i>

1621
01:09:32,389 --> 01:09:34,956
But then it got a virus that
made the motorbikes go slow...

1622
01:09:34,958 --> 01:09:36,958
and then Vanellope stopped
wanting to hang out in there.

1623
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,626
So, is there a way

1624
01:09:38,628 --> 01:09:40,795
to do something
like that to <i>Slaughter Race?</i>

1625
01:09:40,797 --> 01:09:41,832
Oh, there's ways.

1626
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:44,267
Follow me.

1627
01:09:49,039 --> 01:09:50,638
I got mothers' maiden names...

1628
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,974
social security numbers,
PIN numbers...

1629
01:09:52,976 --> 01:09:54,409
Now, this area down here

1630
01:09:54,411 --> 01:09:55,977
is what's called the Darknet.

1631
01:09:55,979 --> 01:09:57,846
A lot of shady characters
hang out down here...

1632
01:09:57,848 --> 01:10:00,014
so try to keep a low profile.
Gord!

1633
01:10:00,016 --> 01:10:01,816
Oh, there you are.

1634
01:10:01,818 --> 01:10:04,352
Now Gord here, he's
dabbled in virus-making.

1635
01:10:04,354 --> 01:10:06,354
But his cousin, this guy
we're gonna go see...

1636
01:10:06,356 --> 01:10:09,326
Double Dan, this dude
is a virus-making machine.

1637
01:10:10,494 --> 01:10:11,526
Oh, oh, here we go.

1638
01:10:11,528 --> 01:10:13,561
Are you sure this is safe?

1639
01:10:13,563 --> 01:10:15,396
Is it safe?
Of course it is.

1640
01:10:15,398 --> 01:10:18,366
Just whatever you do, do not
look at his little brother.

1641
01:10:18,368 --> 01:10:19,870
Oh, he has a little brother?

1642
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,473
Double Dan!

1643
01:10:25,475 --> 01:10:26,875
Long time no see.

1644
01:10:26,877 --> 01:10:28,376
Who are you?

1645
01:10:28,378 --> 01:10:29,778
JP Spamley.

1646
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:31,780
Uh, we met one time
over at Friendster...

1647
01:10:31,782 --> 01:10:35,416
which tells you
it had to be a long time ago.

1648
01:10:35,418 --> 01:10:36,886
- Oye. What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

1649
01:10:36,888 --> 01:10:37,987
Are you looking at my brother?

1650
01:10:37,989 --> 01:10:39,054
- No, sir.
- Don't you look

1651
01:10:39,056 --> 01:10:40,022
at my little brother.

1652
01:10:40,024 --> 01:10:42,357
- Oh, no, I wasn't.
- He's very self-conscious!

1653
01:10:45,395 --> 01:10:46,661
You?

1654
01:10:46,663 --> 01:10:48,530
What are you doing here?

1655
01:10:48,532 --> 01:10:49,764
Uh...

1656
01:10:49,766 --> 01:10:52,001
The reason I came to
your neck of the face...

1657
01:10:52,003 --> 01:10:54,803
I mean, there's a face
in your neck. I mean, woods.

1658
01:10:54,805 --> 01:10:57,139
Neck of the woods. The reason
I'm here is 'cause I...

1659
01:10:57,141 --> 01:10:59,607
Well, I heard
a little tumor, rumor...

1660
01:10:59,609 --> 01:11:01,043
I heard a rumor
that you could, well,

1661
01:11:01,045 --> 01:11:03,444
give me a harmless virus
kind of thing...

1662
01:11:03,446 --> 01:11:04,412
that might be able to

1663
01:11:04,414 --> 01:11:06,414
slow down
the <i>Slaughter Ra</i> game?

1664
01:11:06,416 --> 01:11:08,150
Oh, yeah.

1665
01:11:08,152 --> 01:11:10,986
My cousin Gordon told me
that you wanted to crash it.

1666
01:11:10,988 --> 01:11:12,087
Crash it? No!

1667
01:11:12,089 --> 01:11:13,956
No, no, no.

1668
01:11:13,958 --> 01:11:15,557
I don't want
anyone getting hurt.

1669
01:11:15,559 --> 01:11:16,691
Hmm.

1670
01:11:16,693 --> 01:11:18,761
If there's a way
to just, uh...

1671
01:11:18,763 --> 01:11:19,728
I don't know...

1672
01:11:19,730 --> 01:11:22,064
just make the cars
go slow or something...

1673
01:11:22,066 --> 01:11:24,666
so the game is boring...

1674
01:11:24,668 --> 01:11:26,802
and my friend
comes back home to me.

1675
01:11:26,804 --> 01:11:30,706
Allow me to
introduce you to Arthur.

1676
01:11:32,076 --> 01:11:34,109
Easy there, boy.

1677
01:11:34,111 --> 01:11:35,945
He's keen.

1678
01:11:35,947 --> 01:11:39,782
Arthur's what I call
an insecurity virus.

1679
01:11:39,784 --> 01:11:42,617
Means he looks for
little flaws and weaknesses

1680
01:11:42,619 --> 01:11:44,521
that make a program insecure.

1681
01:11:47,058 --> 01:11:49,825
You release him into that
<i>Slaughter Race</i> game,

1682
01:11:49,827 --> 01:11:52,560
Arthur will find some defect
in the code.

1683
01:11:52,562 --> 01:11:54,129
Then he'll copy that defect

1684
01:11:54,131 --> 01:11:56,866
and spread it
all over the game...

1685
01:11:56,868 --> 01:12:00,501
until everything becomes,
quote, unquote, "boring"...

1686
01:12:00,503 --> 01:12:02,938
just like you wanted.

1687
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:04,106
Okay.

1688
01:12:04,108 --> 01:12:06,008
Just to be super clear here...

1689
01:12:06,010 --> 01:12:07,475
no one gets hurt, right?

1690
01:12:07,477 --> 01:12:08,611
Are you stupid?

1691
01:12:08,613 --> 01:12:09,778
Well, uh...

1692
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:11,981
Because the only way
anyone gets hurt...

1693
01:12:11,983 --> 01:12:13,481
is if you are stupid.

1694
01:12:13,483 --> 01:12:14,984
All you have to do...

1695
01:12:14,986 --> 01:12:18,520
is make sure the virus stays
in <i>Slaughter Race.</i>

1696
01:12:18,522 --> 01:12:20,522
Right. Don't be stupid.

1697
01:12:20,524 --> 01:12:21,857
Make sure it doesn't get out
of <i>Slaughter Race.</i>

1698
01:12:21,859 --> 01:12:22,958
Goiter it. Gah!

1699
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,126
- Got it! Got it.
- Get out!

1700
01:12:24,128 --> 01:12:25,661
Thank you,
you're a cyst face.

1701
01:12:25,663 --> 01:12:26,829
- Out!
- I mean, assistance.

1702
01:12:26,831 --> 01:12:28,697
Thank you for your
cyst face... Assistance.

1703
01:12:28,699 --> 01:12:30,165
- Get out!
- Goodbye!

1704
01:12:30,167 --> 01:12:31,734
Ugh.

1705
01:12:34,872 --> 01:12:36,705
Ah! Fiddlesticks!
Well, that's game.

1706
01:12:36,707 --> 01:12:38,040
Ah, beginner's luck.

1707
01:12:38,042 --> 01:12:39,708
Come on, kid.
I know a hustle

1708
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:40,809
when I see one.

1709
01:12:41,946 --> 01:12:43,913
- Player's on the way.
- Thanks, Bob.

1710
01:12:43,915 --> 01:12:45,514
- Let's roll!
- Game faces on, guys.

1711
01:12:45,516 --> 01:12:47,616
Show time. You ready
for your first race?

1712
01:12:47,618 --> 01:12:50,019
Um, yeah. I think so.

1713
01:12:50,021 --> 01:12:52,621
Hey, don't be nervous.
You're gonna be great.

1714
01:12:52,623 --> 01:12:54,790
Yeah, no, I know.
I'll be fine.

1715
01:12:54,792 --> 01:12:56,928
Mmm. You didn't tell
Ralph yet, did you?

1716
01:12:58,062 --> 01:12:59,895
Not exactly.

1717
01:12:59,897 --> 01:13:02,531
Come on, V.
He's your best friend.

1718
01:13:02,533 --> 01:13:03,832
You gotta let him know

1719
01:13:03,834 --> 01:13:05,567
you're planning on
staying here for a while.

1720
01:13:05,569 --> 01:13:08,570
I know. But he's gonna
get really upset.

1721
01:13:08,572 --> 01:13:10,572
Yeah, he might,
but you guys...

1722
01:13:10,574 --> 01:13:13,175
you'll talk, you'll work it
out, you'll figure it out.

1723
01:13:13,177 --> 01:13:14,977
Yeah, but what if we don't?

1724
01:13:14,979 --> 01:13:17,780
What if his feelings
get hurt so bad...

1725
01:13:17,782 --> 01:13:19,848
he won't wanna be
my friend anymore?

1726
01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:23,085
Look.
All friendships change...

1727
01:13:23,087 --> 01:13:24,920
but the good ones...

1728
01:13:24,922 --> 01:13:26,256
they get stronger
because of it.

1729
01:13:27,725 --> 01:13:29,625
Uh, Shank,
I hate to bother you...

1730
01:13:29,627 --> 01:13:31,961
but the player is waiting.

1731
01:13:31,963 --> 01:13:33,829
I'm not gonna tell you
what to do, kid.

1732
01:13:33,831 --> 01:13:34,899
It's your call.

1733
01:13:35,733 --> 01:13:36,767
Yeah, okay.

1734
01:13:37,702 --> 01:13:38,767
All right.

1735
01:13:38,769 --> 01:13:39,937
Let's race.

1736
01:13:54,219 --> 01:13:56,254
<i>Scanning for insecurities.</i>

1737
01:13:58,823 --> 01:14:00,524
<i>Scanning for insecurities.</i>

1738
01:14:02,893 --> 01:14:05,061
<i>"Precious Car-go."</i>

1739
01:14:05,063 --> 01:14:07,029
<i>Deliver the car
to Bert's Chop Shop...</i>

1740
01:14:07,031 --> 01:14:09,965
<i>but watch out

1741
01:14:27,952 --> 01:14:29,818
Power drift
into a drift jump!

1742
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:31,820
I saw it! You're amazing!

1743
01:14:31,822 --> 01:14:32,823
Thank you.

1744
01:14:41,933 --> 01:14:44,970
<i>Scanning for insecurities.</i>

1745
01:14:49,074 --> 01:14:51,742
Looks like we're not finished.
Come on, V.

1746
01:14:54,146 --> 01:14:55,744
Ralph?

1747
01:15:00,285 --> 01:15:01,617
Huh.

1748
01:15:01,619 --> 01:15:04,120
Okay. Relax. Relax!

1749
01:15:04,122 --> 01:15:05,321
I'll just call him
after the race.

1750
01:15:05,323 --> 01:15:06,956
It'll be okay.

1751
01:15:06,958 --> 01:15:08,126

1757
01:15:25,944 --> 01:15:28,847
What is happening?

1758
01:15:34,753 --> 01:15:36,052
What's going on, Spamley?

1759
01:15:36,054 --> 01:15:38,088
The whole place
is going crazy.

1760
01:15:38,090 --> 01:15:40,156
I thought that virus was just
supposed to slow down her car.

1761
01:15:40,158 --> 01:15:41,257
It was.

1762
01:15:41,259 --> 01:15:43,128
It must've found something
real unstable in there.

1763
01:15:44,729 --> 01:15:46,830
It's her glitch.

1764
01:15:46,832 --> 01:15:48,331
<i>Game reboot begins</i>

1765
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:50,166

1766
01:15:50,168 --> 01:15:51,968
Whoa, hey! Hey, Ralph,
you can't go in there.

1767
01:15:51,970 --> 01:15:52,936
They're gonna
reboot the game...

1768
01:15:52,938 --> 01:15:54,270
and anything that doesn't
belong in there

1769
01:15:54,272 --> 01:15:55,371
will be deleted.

1770
01:15:55,373 --> 01:15:56,940
Yeah, and if I don't
get her outta there,

1771
01:15:56,942 --> 01:15:58,310
Vanellope's gonna die!

1772
01:16:01,079 --> 01:16:03,213
Come on, kid. The game's crashing.
Let's go.

1773
01:16:03,215 --> 01:16:04,781
I think it's my glitch.

1774
01:16:04,783 --> 01:16:07,884
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
destroy your game.

1775
01:16:07,886 --> 01:16:10,954
We'll be fine, but your code
isn't part of this game.

1776
01:16:10,956 --> 01:16:13,758
We got to get you out of here now.
Follow me to the exit.

1777
01:16:22,701 --> 01:16:24,400
Oh, no, no!

1778
01:16:30,909 --> 01:16:32,041
Kid!

1779
01:16:32,043 --> 01:16:34,177
Kid, where are you?

1780
01:16:34,179 --> 01:16:36,379
The server
is rebooting, Ralph.

1781
01:16:36,381 --> 01:16:38,449

get out of here now.

1782
01:16:38,451 --> 01:16:39,718

Come on, Vanellope. Wake up.

1788
01:16:58,303 --> 01:17:00,471
Come on. Don't leave me, kid.

1789
01:17:03,141 --> 01:17:04,441
Ralph?

1790
01:17:04,443 --> 01:17:07,245
Oh. There you are.
You okay, kid?

1791
01:17:07,979 --> 01:17:11,448
Ralph, I messed up so bad.

1792
01:17:11,450 --> 01:17:14,150
No. No, you didn't,
it's okay.

1793
01:17:14,152 --> 01:17:17,220
This is all because of me
and my glitch.

1794
01:17:17,222 --> 01:17:19,122
I should've
just stayed with you...

1795
01:17:19,124 --> 01:17:21,824
instead of following
some stupid dream.

1796
01:17:23,396 --> 01:17:25,398
I've ruined everything.

1797
01:17:25,997 --> 01:17:27,799
No, kid, no.

1798
01:17:29,768 --> 01:17:33,470
Ah, look. I didn't mean
for it to happen like this.

1799
01:17:33,472 --> 01:17:36,275
It was not supposed
to be this bad.

1800
01:17:39,177 --> 01:17:42,145
You didn't mean
for what to happen?

1801
01:17:42,147 --> 01:17:45,817
I mighta,
kinda sorta put a...

1802
01:17:47,118 --> 01:17:50,187
harmless little virus
in the game.

1803
01:17:50,189 --> 01:17:52,423
A virus?

1804
01:17:52,425 --> 01:17:54,991
You did this?

1805
01:17:54,993 --> 01:17:57,127
I wouldn't have done anything

1806
01:17:57,129 --> 01:17:58,495
if I hadn't heard you
tell Shank...

1807
01:17:58,497 --> 01:18:00,297
that you wanted to live in
<i>Slaughter Race</i> forever.

1808
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:04,000
So you were spying on me?

1809
01:18:04,002 --> 01:18:06,170
Hey. You're not exactly
innocent here.

1810
01:18:06,172 --> 01:18:08,838
You were gonna ditch everybody
and abandon <i>Sugar Rush.</i>

1811
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,840
Oh, please.
I'm one of 16 racers.

1812
01:18:10,842 --> 01:18:12,176
They'd never miss me.

1813
01:18:12,178 --> 01:18:13,510
What about me?

1814
01:18:13,512 --> 01:18:16,045
Why would I ever spend
another second with you...

1815
01:18:16,047 --> 01:18:17,216

1816
01:18:19,118 --> 01:18:20,353
No!

1817
01:18:24,290 --> 01:18:25,790
No.

1818
01:18:26,459 --> 01:18:28,158

1819
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,560
Wherever you're not.

1820
01:18:29,562 --> 01:18:30,893
Wait a minute.
I can explain.

1821
01:18:30,895 --> 01:18:32,596
No! You will not
follow me.

1822
01:18:32,598 --> 01:18:34,164
Vanellope, please...

1823
01:18:34,166 --> 01:18:36,899

what you did. Never!

1824
01:18:36,901 --> 01:18:39,336

1825
01:18:39,338 --> 01:18:42,006

1826
01:18:42,008 --> 01:18:44,575

I'm so sorry.
I don't how this happened.

1887
01:22:10,383 --> 01:22:11,483
Well, I think
it's fairly obvious.

1888
01:22:11,485 --> 01:22:14,118
It happened because
an insecurity virus cloned...

1889
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:16,621
all of your needy, clingy,
self-destructive behavior.

1890
01:22:16,623 --> 01:22:18,323
The very behavior
which left unchecked

1891
01:22:18,325 --> 01:22:19,691
can destroy friendships...

1892
01:22:19,693 --> 01:22:23,361

the entire Internet!

1893
01:22:25,265 --> 01:22:27,131

1895
01:22:28,435 --> 01:22:30,468
what do I do if clones of me

1896
01:22:30,470 --> 01:22:33,071
are trying to capture
my friend? Search.

1897
01:22:34,374 --> 01:22:36,574
I find two results
for your query.

1898
01:22:36,576 --> 01:22:38,710
Either you put all the clones
in therapy.

1899
01:22:38,712 --> 01:22:40,678
Not very realistic.

1900
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,647
Or, the anti-virus district
is surrounded

1901
01:22:42,649 --> 01:22:44,716
by a gate made from
security software.

1902
01:22:44,718 --> 01:22:45,683
If Vanellope could somehow

1903
01:22:45,685 --> 01:22:47,185
lead all of the clones
through the gate...

1904
01:22:47,187 --> 01:22:49,187
they would be deleted
all at once.

1905
01:22:49,189 --> 01:22:52,390
Sort of a co-dependent
pied piper situation.

1906
01:22:52,392 --> 01:22:55,126
Wait. We know a pied piper.

1907
01:22:55,128 --> 01:22:56,561
- We do?
- Yesss.

1908
01:22:56,563 --> 01:22:58,129
- Who?
- Yesss!

1909
01:22:58,131 --> 01:22:58,798
Yeah, but who is it?

1910
01:23:01,201 --> 01:23:02,636
Oh, you mean Yesss!

1911
01:23:06,573 --> 01:23:09,440
Thanks for your help,
KnowsMore.

1912
01:23:09,442 --> 01:23:11,175
It's a bit of an empty gesture
at this point,

1913
01:23:11,177 --> 01:23:13,378
wouldn't you say?

1914
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:14,779
Guess I forgot
to tell Ralph

1915
01:23:14,781 --> 01:23:16,514
that when you
break the Internet...

1916
01:23:16,516 --> 01:23:19,317
you don't literally
have to break the Internet.

1917
01:23:19,319 --> 01:23:20,552
I can't believe he did this.

1918
01:23:20,554 --> 01:23:23,187
Yeah, well, I mean,
dude obviously made

1919
01:23:23,189 --> 01:23:25,323
some real questionable
choices here.

1920
01:23:25,325 --> 01:23:29,460
But he also made a bee pun to
save his best friend's game...

1921
01:23:29,462 --> 01:23:33,266
so what can I say, kid,
life's complicated.

1922
01:23:34,334 --> 01:23:36,303
You ready to pied the piper?

1923
01:23:39,339 --> 01:23:41,341
Yoo-hoo! Up here!

1924
01:23:42,777 --> 01:23:45,878
It's me, your bestest friend
in the whole wide world...

1925
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:47,280
who you can't live without!

1926
01:23:48,248 --> 01:23:49,817
Friend!

1927
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:55,620
Wow, from up here I can see
how I do come across as...

1928
01:23:55,622 --> 01:23:57,388
needy, and clingy,

1929
01:23:57,390 --> 01:23:59,760
and self-destructive
like KnowsMore said.

1930
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:02,460
Listen, kid...

1931
01:24:02,462 --> 01:24:03,328
I don't blame you

1932
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:05,597
for not wanting
to be my friend anymore.

1933
01:24:05,599 --> 01:24:07,766
I never said I didn't
want to be your friend.

1934
01:24:07,768 --> 01:24:11,469
I said you were acting like
a bad friend. Which you were.

1935
01:24:11,471 --> 01:24:13,204
I know I was, but I...

1936
01:24:13,206 --> 01:24:14,339
Hey, my babies!

1937
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:17,475
That's the anti-virus district
straight ahead. Whoo!

1938
01:24:17,477 --> 01:24:19,145
All right, to be
continued, okay?

1939
01:24:26,821 --> 01:24:28,821
Whoo-hoo!
We're gonna make it!

1940
01:24:44,839 --> 01:24:46,270
You guys okay?

1941
01:24:46,272 --> 01:24:47,539
I'm fine!

1942
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:50,542
Yeah, all good.
Look, we can still do this.

1943
01:24:50,544 --> 01:24:52,845
Come on, big man.
Help me turn this thing over.

1944
01:24:53,948 --> 01:24:56,280
Uh...

1945
01:24:56,282 --> 01:24:58,484
Uh, guys?

1946
01:25:08,863 --> 01:25:12,296
Friend?

1947
01:25:12,298 --> 01:25:14,566
That is unsettling.

1948
01:25:18,406 --> 01:25:19,707
Friend.

1949
01:25:20,408 --> 01:25:21,974
Get Vanellope out of here now.

1950
01:25:21,976 --> 01:25:23,108
What about you, Ralph?

1951
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:25,245
Just go. I got a date with
the man in the mirror.

1952
01:25:26,279 --> 01:25:27,615
Hey, you!

1953
01:25:30,484 --> 01:25:32,951
You keep away from her!

1954
01:25:32,953 --> 01:25:35,621
I'm gonna wreck it!

1955
01:25:37,825 --> 01:25:40,661
She's not your friend!

1956
01:25:41,429 --> 01:25:43,229
She's my friend!

1957
01:25:44,331 --> 01:25:45,698
Here it is, this way.

1958
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:47,768
Come on, kid.
We gotta move.

1959
01:26:00,347 --> 01:26:01,682
Eeeee-oh-boy!

1960
01:26:18,766 --> 01:26:19,834
No!

1961
01:26:20,868 --> 01:26:22,534
Whoa!

1962
01:26:22,536 --> 01:26:25,706
Vanellope!

1963
01:26:30,377 --> 01:26:32,646
Hey! Let go of me!

1964
01:26:35,316 --> 01:26:36,784
- Kid!
- Ralph!

1965
01:26:41,622 --> 01:26:43,355
Hey!

1966
01:26:43,357 --> 01:26:45,791
Hey, get back here!

1967
01:26:45,793 --> 01:26:46,794
Huh?

1968
01:26:48,562 --> 01:26:49,995
You put her down!

1969
01:26:49,997 --> 01:26:51,830
Whoa!

1970
01:27:13,922 --> 01:27:15,489
Vanellope!

1971
01:27:31,739 --> 01:27:35,010
You know, you're acting
like a real bad guy here!

1972
01:27:35,676 --> 01:27:38,077
No!

1973
01:27:38,079 --> 01:27:39,611
Well, you are!

1974
01:27:39,613 --> 01:27:41,549
And I will never
be your friend!

1975
01:27:45,753 --> 01:27:47,055
Hey, doofus!

1976
01:27:47,956 --> 01:27:48,756
Ralph!

1977
01:27:56,697 --> 01:27:58,934
Catch me if you can,
you big dummy!

1978
01:28:05,639 --> 01:28:07,040
I got you, little sister.

1979
01:28:10,745 --> 01:28:12,411
Now go!
Get out of here!

1980
01:28:12,413 --> 01:28:14,080
- Ralph!
- Go!

1981
01:28:14,082 --> 01:28:16,885
No!
Don't hurt him!

1982
01:28:17,551 --> 01:28:18,619
Please, no!

1983
01:28:23,424 --> 01:28:25,892
Stop it!
You're squishing him!

1984
01:28:27,629 --> 01:28:29,629
You're gonna
kill my best friend!

1985
01:28:33,835 --> 01:28:36,104
Fine! You win!
You win, okay?

1986
01:28:39,608 --> 01:28:41,910
Just please put him down.

1987
01:28:44,546 --> 01:28:47,080
I'll be your
only friend, okay?

1988
01:28:47,082 --> 01:28:49,148
Just let him go.

1989
01:28:49,150 --> 01:28:50,752
No! No, kid.

1990
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:52,921
Huh?

1991
01:28:54,556 --> 01:28:56,789
That's it.
That's it. Yeah.

1992
01:28:56,791 --> 01:28:59,659
Put him down
and I'll go with you...

1993
01:28:59,661 --> 01:29:01,160
and we'll be
best friends forever.

1994
01:29:02,530 --> 01:29:04,664
Just me and you.

1995
01:29:04,666 --> 01:29:05,867
That's what you want, right?

1996
01:29:09,137 --> 01:29:10,437
Well,
that's not what I want!

1997
01:29:12,207 --> 01:29:14,774
It's not right to hold
a friend back from her dreams!

1998
01:29:14,776 --> 01:29:16,910
You don't own her!

1999
01:29:16,912 --> 01:29:19,712
That's not how
friendship works!

2000
01:29:19,714 --> 01:29:21,549
You need to let her go!

2001
01:29:23,685 --> 01:29:24,686
Hey.

2002
01:29:28,723 --> 01:29:29,824
You need to let her go.

2003
01:29:32,861 --> 01:29:35,931
I know. It's gonna hurt
a little bit when you do.

2004
01:29:37,899 --> 01:29:39,834
Oh, who am I kidding?
It's gonna hurt a lot.

2005
01:29:41,703 --> 01:29:43,905
But you're gonna be okay.

2006
01:29:46,574 --> 01:29:48,274
And we're gonna be okay.

2007
01:29:48,276 --> 01:29:49,544
Right, kid?

2008
01:29:51,179 --> 01:29:53,848
Of course we are. Always.

2009
01:29:55,984 --> 01:29:59,052
See? No matter
where she goes...

2010
01:29:59,054 --> 01:30:01,888
or where she lives...

2011
01:30:01,890 --> 01:30:04,157
she's always gonna
be our friend.

2012
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:06,626
And we just gotta trust her.

2013
01:30:06,628 --> 01:30:09,064
Because that's what
best friends do.

2014
01:30:10,165 --> 01:30:11,666
Right?

2015
01:30:26,248 --> 01:30:27,582
Thanks, buddy.

2016
01:30:29,050 --> 01:30:30,986
Wow!

2017
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:34,587
I feel good about this.

2018
01:30:34,589 --> 01:30:36,589
Mmm.

2019
01:30:36,591 --> 01:30:38,927
Mmm.

2020
01:30:40,962 --> 01:30:42,129
Ralph, look!

2021
01:30:42,131 --> 01:30:44,065
I think you fixed
your insecurity!

2022
01:30:46,068 --> 01:30:47,301
You're right.

2023
01:30:47,303 --> 01:30:49,635
Whoo-hoo!

2024
01:30:49,637 --> 01:30:50,803
Ralph, no!

2025
01:30:52,807 --> 01:30:54,308
Whoa!

2026
01:30:54,310 --> 01:30:56,310
Park it right here, Ralph!

2027
01:30:56,312 --> 01:30:58,644
Your ol' pal
JP Spamley's gotcha!

2028
01:30:58,646 --> 01:31:00,815
Whoo!

2029
01:31:02,151 --> 01:31:03,217
Wow, that didn't work.

2030
01:31:07,856 --> 01:31:09,756
Look up there!

2031
01:31:09,758 --> 01:31:11,626
It's a big strong man
in need of rescuing.

2032
01:31:20,269 --> 01:31:21,070
Hah!

2033
01:32:10,119 --> 01:32:12,154
Mmm.

2034
01:32:14,190 --> 01:32:16,125
Oh, thanks, Frogger.

2035
01:32:16,658 --> 01:32:17,793
Wait a minute.

2036
01:32:18,327 --> 01:32:19,960
Who are all of you?

2037
01:32:19,962 --> 01:32:21,995
We're friends of Vanellope's.

2038
01:32:21,997 --> 01:32:24,164
Yeah, and any friend
of Vanellope's

2039
01:32:24,166 --> 01:32:25,799
is a friend of ours.

2040
01:32:25,801 --> 01:32:27,668
You're welcome.

2041
01:32:27,670 --> 01:32:29,036
Ralph!

2042
01:32:29,038 --> 01:32:31,138
Looking good, big fella!

2043
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:32,773
Heyo!

2044
01:32:33,876 --> 01:32:35,075
This dress is not made
for a big boy.

2045
01:32:35,077 --> 01:32:37,077
It's going right up
the back alley there.

2046
01:32:37,079 --> 01:32:38,745
Let me just make
a little adjustment.

2047
01:32:38,747 --> 01:32:41,181
There we go.

2048
01:32:41,183 --> 01:32:42,783
<i>Internet users are breathing</i>

2049
01:32:42,785 --> 01:32:45,085
<i>a collective sigh
of relief tonight.</i>

2050
01:32:45,087 --> 01:32:47,421
<i>Just as mysteriously
as it appeared,</i>

2051
01:32:47,423 --> 01:32:49,825
<i>the Wreck-It Ralph virus
has vanished.</i>

2052
01:32:56,098 --> 01:32:58,198
You know what
I just realized?

2053
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:00,934
The sun never rises
or sets here...

2054
01:33:00,936 --> 01:33:02,903
because everything's
always on.

2055
01:33:02,905 --> 01:33:05,472
Well, now, isn't that
an astute observation?

2056
01:33:05,474 --> 01:33:07,040
I know, right?

2057
01:33:07,042 --> 01:33:08,242
You know,
other than KnowsMore,

2058
01:33:08,244 --> 01:33:10,010
I'm probably the smartest guy
on the Internet.

2059
01:33:10,012 --> 01:33:12,045
Yeah. Yeah.

2060
01:33:12,047 --> 01:33:15,048
Yo, V. We're about to come
back online. You ready?

2061
01:33:15,050 --> 01:33:16,450
Be right there!

2062
01:33:16,452 --> 01:33:19,119
Hey, Ralph,
don't be a stranger!

2063
01:33:19,121 --> 01:33:21,722
Well, I can't be much stranger
than you, Shank.

2064
01:33:21,724 --> 01:33:24,126
Oh. That's a good dad joke.

2065
01:33:25,428 --> 01:33:27,127
Hey, don't forget.

2066
01:33:27,129 --> 01:33:29,062
You know Shank added
my code and everything,

2067
01:33:29,064 --> 01:33:30,898
so I'll be able
to regenerate.

2068
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:32,032
I'm gonna be totally safe.

2069
01:33:32,034 --> 01:33:34,469
No, I know.
It's gonna be great.

2070
01:33:34,471 --> 01:33:36,069
You found your dream game.

2071
01:33:36,071 --> 01:33:37,339
Yeah, I did.

2072
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:39,241
I did.

2073
01:33:40,109 --> 01:33:42,242
So, uh...

2074
01:33:42,244 --> 01:33:45,279
I guess I should probably
head in there now, you know?

2075
01:33:45,281 --> 01:33:48,250
Oh, before you go,
I wanted to give you this.

2076
01:33:49,318 --> 01:33:52,152
Oh, I'm so sorry
I broke it, Ralph.

2077
01:33:52,154 --> 01:33:54,188
No, no. It's okay.

2078
01:33:54,190 --> 01:33:56,225
Now we can both
have a half. See?

2079
01:33:58,295 --> 01:33:59,094
Yeah!

2080
01:34:06,869 --> 01:34:08,804
I love you so much.

2081
01:34:09,939 --> 01:34:11,308
I'm really gonna miss you.

2082
01:34:13,175 --> 01:34:15,110
I'm gonna miss you too, kid.

2083
01:34:16,313 --> 01:34:17,846
I really am.

2084
01:34:23,453 --> 01:34:24,454
All right.

2085
01:34:26,356 --> 01:34:28,291
Okay, getting a little clingy
on me, here.

2086
01:34:31,194 --> 01:34:33,228
Go on. Get out of here.

2087
01:34:33,230 --> 01:34:34,497
The world's
waiting for you, kid.

2088
01:35:32,122 --> 01:35:34,188
<i>I'll be honest,</i>

2089
01:35:34,190 --> 01:35:36,491
<i>it still feels kind of
weird around here.</i>

2090
01:35:36,493 --> 01:35:38,526
<i>I mean, a lot has changed.</i>

2091
01:35:38,528 --> 01:35:39,994
<i>Even though we got
that steering wheel</i>

2092
01:35:39,996 --> 01:35:41,062
<i>and saved</i> Sugar Rush...

2093
01:35:41,064 --> 01:35:43,233
<i>it's never really gonna
be the same.</i>

2094
01:35:45,235 --> 01:35:46,434
<i>For one thing,
the racers aren't even</i>

2095
01:35:46,436 --> 01:35:48,036
<i>that obnoxious anymore.</i>

2096
01:35:48,038 --> 01:35:50,438
Oh, golly. I'm sorry
you didn't win, Taffyta.

2097
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:53,074
Pfft! Our friendship
is much more important to me

2098
01:35:53,076 --> 01:35:54,375
than winning, Rancis.

2099
01:35:54,377 --> 01:35:56,110
Losing builds character!

2100
01:35:56,112 --> 01:35:58,046
Everyone's a winner, Taffyta.

2101
01:35:58,048 --> 01:35:59,580
<i>Felix and Calhoun,</i>

2102
01:35:59,582 --> 01:36:00,782
<i>as goofy as they are,</i>

2103
01:36:00,784 --> 01:36:03,217
<i>they turned out to be
pretty great parents.</i>

2104
01:36:03,219 --> 01:36:04,519
I gotta hand it
to you two,

2105
01:36:04,521 --> 01:36:07,021
how on earth did you
tame those things?

2106
01:36:07,023 --> 01:36:08,389
It's simple, Surge.

2107
01:36:08,391 --> 01:36:10,992
The key to parenting is...

2108
01:36:13,963 --> 01:36:15,930
And then what you do is...

2109
01:36:18,401 --> 01:36:21,636
And that is the secret
to raising perfect children.

2110
01:36:21,638 --> 01:36:25,073
Wow, I wish every parent
could hear that.

2111
01:36:25,075 --> 01:36:26,441
<i>I'm keeping busy, too.</i>

2112
01:36:26,443 --> 01:36:28,376
<i>I finally joined
Zangief's book club.</i>

2113
01:36:28,378 --> 01:36:30,445
Good point, Bison.
And how about you, Ralph?

2114
01:36:30,447 --> 01:36:32,380
Do you feel Dostoyevsky

2115
01:36:32,382 --> 01:36:34,982
intended to make
narrator unreliable?

2116
01:36:34,984 --> 01:36:36,451
Um...

2117
01:36:36,453 --> 01:36:38,654
I do and I don't.

2118
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:41,222
You do, and you don't.

2119
01:36:41,224 --> 01:36:43,991
Duality.
That's really deep, Ralph.

2120
01:36:43,993 --> 01:36:45,293
Thanks, Sonic.

2121
01:36:45,295 --> 01:36:48,029
I don't know
what I'm talking about.

2122
01:36:48,031 --> 01:36:50,365
<i>Oh. And we got this new thing
we do every Friday night...</i>

2123
01:36:50,367 --> 01:36:52,467
<i>where we all go and hang out
in a different game.</i>

2124
01:36:52,469 --> 01:36:54,135
<i>I actually hosted this week.</i>

2125
01:36:54,137 --> 01:36:55,536
Heyo!

2126
01:36:55,538 --> 01:36:58,139
Hope you're all hungry.
I made burnt pie.

2127
01:36:58,141 --> 01:37:00,007
What's burnt pie,
Wreck-It?

2128
01:37:00,009 --> 01:37:02,310
Oh, it's just a pie
that you burn.

2129
01:37:02,312 --> 01:37:03,244
You can use any pie.

2130
01:37:03,246 --> 01:37:05,012
You just leave it
in the oven too long.

2131
01:37:08,151 --> 01:37:11,319
<i>Yeah, we really do
have a lot of fun.</i>

2132
01:37:11,321 --> 01:37:14,656
I guess that's pretty much
all the news I got for you.

2133
01:37:14,658 --> 01:37:17,392
<i>Oh, man, your stories
never disappoint, Ralph.</i>

2134
01:37:17,394 --> 01:37:18,993
<i>I just wish
we could hang out sooner.</i>

2135
01:37:18,995 --> 01:37:20,496
Yeah. Me, too.

2136
01:37:20,498 --> 01:37:22,196
When did you say you were
getting those days off?

2137
01:37:22,198 --> 01:37:24,999
<i>Uh, our upgrade
starts on January 25th,</i>

2138
01:37:25,001 --> 01:37:26,702
<i>so, like, two months
from now.</i>

2139
01:37:26,704 --> 01:37:29,370
Oh, that'll go by in a flash.
Oh, speaking of which...

2140
01:37:29,372 --> 01:37:30,472
you want me to bring you
anything from home

2141
01:37:30,474 --> 01:37:31,473
when I come visit?

2142
01:37:31,475 --> 01:37:33,542
<i>Oh! You know what
I cannot find</i>

2143
01:37:33,544 --> 01:37:35,309
<i>anywhere on the Internet?</i>

2144
01:37:35,311 --> 01:37:38,246
<i>A halfway decent</i>
BurgerTime <i>burger.</i>

2145
01:37:38,248 --> 01:37:40,549
<i>I've been talking them up
to Shank and the crew.</i>

2146
01:37:40,551 --> 01:37:42,283
<i>And honestly, I think
they're starting to think</i>

2147
01:37:42,285 --> 01:37:43,452
<i>I'm making it up.</i>

2148
01:37:43,454 --> 01:37:44,720
All right,
consider it done.

2149
01:37:44,722 --> 01:37:46,390
I'll bring you guys
a truckload.

2150
01:37:48,726 --> 01:37:51,058
Well, sun's coming up already.

2151
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:52,528
Guess I better get to it.

2152
01:37:52,530 --> 01:37:54,028
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

2153
01:37:54,030 --> 01:37:55,196
<i>Talk next week?</i>

2154
01:37:55,198 --> 01:37:57,064
I shall await your call,
madam.

2155
01:37:57,066 --> 01:38:01,670
<i>Then,</i> adieu, adieu,
<i>farting is such sweet sorrow.</i>

2156
01:38:01,672 --> 01:38:03,973
<i>So long, stinkbrain.</i>

2157
01:38:04,542 --> 01:38:05,443
Bye, kid.

2158
01:38:19,356 --> 01:38:22,357
Hey. You doing
okay there, Ralph?

2159
01:38:22,359 --> 01:38:26,595
Yeah, I am, actually.
I'm doing great.

2160
01:38:26,597 --> 01:38:29,333
Come on, Felix.
Let's get to work, buddy.

2161
01:42:00,745 --> 01:42:03,813
Hey, Mo, did you like
the movie, sweetie?

2162
01:42:03,815 --> 01:42:06,416
Well, there was a scene
in the trailer...

2163
01:42:06,418 --> 01:42:08,451
that wasn't in the movie...

2164
01:42:08,453 --> 01:42:10,887
and that makes me sad.

2165
01:42:10,889 --> 01:42:12,989
Aw, that's too bad.

2166
01:42:12,991 --> 01:42:14,590
Maybe playing your game
will cheer you up.

2167
01:42:14,592 --> 01:42:15,593
Okay.

2168
01:42:18,029 --> 01:42:19,762
Pancake.

2169
01:42:19,764 --> 01:42:20,865
Milkshake.

2170
01:42:21,933 --> 01:42:24,469
Pancake.
Pancake.

2171
01:42:25,003 --> 01:42:26,234
Milkshake.

2172
01:42:26,236 --> 01:42:27,804
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh.
I wanna try, I wanna try!</i>

2173
01:42:27,806 --> 01:42:29,272
<i>My turn, my turn!</i>

2174
01:42:29,274 --> 01:42:31,307
<i>Pancake. Milkshake.</i>

2175
01:42:31,309 --> 01:42:33,676
<i>Milkshake. Milkshake.</i>

2176
01:42:33,678 --> 01:42:35,511
Pancake. Pancake.

2177
01:42:35,513 --> 01:42:37,847
Milkshake.
Milkshake.

2178
01:42:37,849 --> 01:42:39,582
I'm starting to understand
why people like this game.

2179
01:42:39,584 --> 01:42:40,983
Very zen.

2180
01:42:42,921 --> 01:42:45,621
Hey, everybody,
look what I found!

2181
01:42:45,623 --> 01:42:47,757
- More pancakes!
- Sweet!

2182
01:42:47,759 --> 01:42:49,992
Let's speed it up.
Pancake, pancake, pancake.

2183
01:42:49,994 --> 01:42:51,461
Pancake, pancake, pancake.

2184
01:42:51,463 --> 01:42:53,496
Pancake, pancake, pancake.

2185
01:42:53,498 --> 01:42:55,631
Pancake, pancake, pancake.

2186
01:42:55,633 --> 01:42:57,900
Eat, little bunny.
Eat, eat, eat!

2187
01:42:57,902 --> 01:42:59,535
Uh, Ralph, you might wanna try
feeding the kitty

2188
01:42:59,537 --> 01:43:01,037
for a little while.

2189
01:43:01,039 --> 01:43:03,773
No, the kitty gets
the milkshake.

2190
01:43:03,775 --> 01:43:07,612
The bunny gets the pancake.

2191
