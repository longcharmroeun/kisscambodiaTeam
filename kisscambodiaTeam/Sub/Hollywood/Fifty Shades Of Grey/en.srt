792
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:55,093
I'm not exactlyjumping
at the opportunity

793
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,846
to get whipped and tortured
in your red room of pain.

794
00:52:57,925 --> 00:53:00,144
That room is much more
about pleasure.

795
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,054
Promise you.

796
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:09,316
Would we still go out
to dinner and movies?

797
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:12,281
That's not really my thing.

798
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,322
Try to keep an open mind.

799
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:21,449
If you agree to be
my submissive,

800
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,617
I will be devoted to you.

804
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:39,307
We slept in the same bed

820
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:12,901
One of my mother's friends.

821
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,229
I was 15.

822
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,898
She seduced you?

823
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:19,908
I was her submissive
for six years.

824
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,569

825
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:24,910
Does your mother know that?

826
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,790
Of course not.

827
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:31,454
No one in my family knows
about this part of me.

828
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:37,092
So, she introduced you
to all this?

829
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:39,253

Well, what changed your mind?

839

By giving up control,
I felt free.

But why do you even wanna do
anything to me at all, Christian?

If I told you, you would never
look at me the same way again.

right now?

Yes. I wanna punish you
right now.

same way about being punished

want to punish me then?

Why do you need to?
