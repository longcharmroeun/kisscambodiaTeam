I feel like you're driving
me to a court-martial.

9
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,672
This is crazy.
What did I do?

10
00:01:30,755 --> 00:01:32,215
I feel like you're going
to pull over and snuff me.

11
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:34,718
What, you're not allowed
to talk? Hey, Forrest!

12
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:36,011
We can talk, sir.

13
00:01:36,094 --> 00:01:38,513
Oh, I see.
So it's personal?

14
00:01:38,597 --> 00:01:39,764
No, you intimidate them.

15
00:01:39,848 --> 00:01:41,474
Good God, you're a woman.

16
00:01:41,516 --> 00:01:43,185
I honestly...
I couldn't have called that.

17
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,706
I mean, I'd apologize, but isn't
that what we're going for here?

18
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:47,147
I thought of you as
a soldier first.

19
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:48,523
I'm an airman.

20
00:01:48,607 --> 00:01:50,358
You have, actually, excellent
bone structure, there.

21
00:01:50,442 --> 00:01:53,236
I'm kind of having a hard
time not looking at you now.

22
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,448
Is that weird?
Come on, it's okay, laugh.

23
00:01:56,531 --> 00:01:57,782
Sir, I have a question to ask.

24
00:01:57,866 --> 00:01:59,534
Yes, please.

25
00:01:59,618 --> 00:02:02,787
<i>Is it true you went 12 for 12 with
last year's Maxim cover models?</i>

26
00:02:02,913 --> 00:02:05,081
That is an excellent question.
Yes and no.

27
00:02:05,165 --> 00:02:06,645
March and I had a
scheduling conflict,

28
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,628
but fortunately, the
Christmas cover was twins.

29
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:12,589
Anything else? You're kidding
me with the hand up, right?

30
00:02:12,672 --> 00:02:14,341
Is it cool if I take
a picture with you?

31
00:02:14,382 --> 00:02:16,092
Yes.
It's very cool.

32
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:21,431
All right.

33
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:23,642
I don't want to see this
on your MySpace page.

34
00:02:23,725 --> 00:02:25,310
Please, no gang signs.

35
00:02:25,393 --> 00:02:26,978
No, throw it up.
I'm kidding.

36
00:02:27,062 --> 00:02:28,813
Yeah, peace.
I love peace.

37
00:02:28,897 --> 00:02:30,190
I'd be out of a
job with peace.

38
00:02:30,232 --> 00:02:34,027

Just click it. Don't change any settings.

- Contact left!

40
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,620
What have we got?

41
00:02:44,913 --> 00:02:46,957
Jimmy, stay with Stark!

42
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,583
- Stay down!
- Yeah.

43

Son of a bitch!

44
00:02:57,592 --> 00:02:58,927
Wait, wait, wait!
Give me a gun!

45
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,262
Stay here!

46
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:30,667

We should just stay
till the morning.

84
00:06:50,992 --> 00:06:52,994
You are unbelievable.

85
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:54,704
Oh, no!
Did they rope you into this?

86
00:06:54,788 --> 00:06:56,373
Nobody roped me into anything!

87
00:06:56,456 --> 00:06:57,707
- I'm so sorry.
- But they told me that

88
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,418
if I presented you with an
award, you'd be deeply honored.

89
00:07:00,502 --> 00:07:02,462
Of course I'd be deeply honored.
And it's you, that's great.

90
00:07:02,504 --> 00:07:04,256
- So when do we do it?
- It's right here.

91
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:06,508
- Here you go.
- There it is. That was easy.

92
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,926
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, it's okay.

93
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:10,345
Wow! Would you look at that?
That's something else.

94
00:07:10,387 --> 00:07:12,027
I don't have any of
those floating around.

95
00:07:12,055 --> 00:07:15,183
We're gonna let it ride!

96
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:17,352
Give me a hand, will you?
Give me a little something-something.

97
00:07:17,435 --> 00:07:18,687
Okay, you, too.

98
00:07:18,728 --> 00:07:20,522
- I don't blow on a man's dice.
- Come on, honey bear.

99
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:23,149
There it is.
Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...

100
00:07:23,191 --> 00:07:24,484
Two craps. Line away.

101
00:07:24,526 --> 00:07:26,406
That's what happens.
Worse things have happened.

102
00:07:26,444 --> 00:07:28,404
I think we're gonna be fine.
Color me up, William.

103
00:07:28,405 --> 00:07:29,447
- This is where I exit.
- All right.

104
00:07:29,531 --> 00:07:30,532
Tomorrow, don't be late.

105
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:31,867
- Yeah, you can count on it.
- I'm serious!

106
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:33,368
I know, I know.

107
00:07:33,451 --> 00:07:36,413
Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's.
There you go.

108
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:43,753
Mr. Stark!
Excuse me, Mr. Stark!

<i>Christine Everhart,
Vanity Fair magazine.</i>

110
00:07:46,173 --> 00:07:47,257
Can I ask you a
couple of questions?

111
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,884
- She's cute.
- She's all right?

112
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:49,967
- Hi.
- Hi.

113
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,970
- Yeah. Okay, go.
- It's okay?

114
00:07:52,053 --> 00:07:53,889
You've been called the
Da Vinci of our time.

115
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,808
- What do you say to that?
- Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.

116
00:07:56,892 --> 00:07:58,476
And what do you say to
your other nickname?

117
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,560
"The Merchant of Death"?

118
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:01,897
That's not bad.

119
00:08:01,938 --> 00:08:04,232
Let me guess.
Berkeley?

120
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:05,442
Brown, actually.

121
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:08,445
Well, Ms. Brown,

122
00:08:08,528 --> 00:08:10,488
it's an imperfect world, but
it's the only one we've got.

123
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:13,283
I guarantee you, the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,

124
00:08:13,366 --> 00:08:15,243
I'll start making bricks and
beams for baby hospitals.

125
00:08:15,285 --> 00:08:16,995
Rehearse that much?

126
00:08:17,078 --> 00:08:18,455
Every night in front of the
mirror before bedtime.

127
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:19,539
I can see that.

128
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:20,916
I'd like to show
you first-hand.

129
00:08:20,957 --> 00:08:23,251
All I want is a
serious answer.

130
00:08:23,293 --> 00:08:25,504
Okay, here's serious.
My old man had a philosophy,

131
00:08:25,587 --> 00:08:28,006
"Peace means having a bigger
stick than the other guy."

132
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:30,409
That's a great line coming from
the guy selling the sticks.

133
00:08:30,425 --> 00:08:31,760
My father helped
defeat the Nazis.

134
00:08:31,843 --> 00:08:33,261
He worked on the
Manhattan Project.

135
00:08:33,303 --> 00:08:35,931
A lot of people, including
your professors at Brown,

136
00:08:35,972 --> 00:08:37,474
would call that being a hero.

137
00:08:37,557 --> 00:08:39,434
And a lot of people would also
call that war profiteering.

138
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:41,759
Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved

139
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,522
by advancing
medical technology

140
00:08:43,605 --> 00:08:45,941
or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?

141
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:49,277
All those breakthroughs,
military funding, honey.

142
00:08:50,904 --> 00:08:52,781
You ever lose an hour of
sleep your whole life?

143
00:08:52,864 --> 00:08:54,449
I'd be prepared to
lose a few with you.

144
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:10,774
<i>Good morning.

146
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:17,931

Tony?

149
00:09:40,161 --> 00:09:41,413
Hey, Tony?

150
00:10:03,982 --> 00:10:05,662
<i>You are not authorized
to access this area.</i>

151
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:08,815
- Jesus.
- That's Jarvis. He runs the house.

152
00:10:08,857 --> 00:10:11,526
I've got your clothes here.
They've been dry-cleaned and pressed,

153
00:10:11,568 --> 00:10:13,361
and there's a car
waiting for you outside

154
00:10:13,403 --> 00:10:15,989
that will take you
anywhere you'd like to go.

155
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:18,533
You must be the
famous Pepper Potts.

156
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:21,036
Indeed I am.

157
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:25,040
After all these years, Tony still has
you picking up the dry-cleaning.

158
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:28,502
I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires,

159
00:10:28,543 --> 00:10:31,379
including, occasionally,
taking out the trash.

160
00:10:31,421 --> 00:10:32,547
Will that be all?

161
00:10:33,715 --> 00:10:35,217
<i>Sometimes I try to do things</i>

162
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,177
<i>but it just doesn't work
out the way I want it to,</i>

163
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,387
<i>and I get real frustrated</i>

164
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:41,473
<i>and then, like, I
try hard to do it</i>

165
00:10:41,556 --> 00:10:43,058
<i>and I, like, take my time</i>

166
00:10:43,099 --> 00:10:44,726
<i>but it just doesn't work
out the way I want it to.</i>

167
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:46,895
<i>It's like I concentrate
on it real hard</i>

168
00:10:46,978 --> 00:10:49,397
<i>but it just doesn't work out.</i>

169
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:51,191
Give me an exploded view.

170
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,694
<i>The compression in
cylinder three appears to be low.</i>

171
00:10:54,736 --> 00:10:55,820
Log that.

172
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:00,858
I'm gonna try
again, right now.

173
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:01,868
Please don't turn
down my music.

174
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,453
I'll keep you posted.

175
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,871
You are supposed to be halfway
around the world right now.

176
00:11:04,913 --> 00:11:06,081
How'd she take it?

177
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:07,457
Like a champ.

178
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,042
Why are you trying to
hustle me out of here?

179
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:10,710
Your flight was scheduled to
leave an hour and a half ago.

180
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:12,921
That's funny, I thought with
it being my plane and all,

181
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,548
that it would just wait
for me to get there.

182
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:16,383
Tony, I need to speak to
you about a couple things

183
00:11:16,424 --> 00:11:18,093
before I get you
out of the door.

184
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:19,886
Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole
purpose of having your own plane

185
00:11:19,928 --> 00:11:21,721
if it departs
before you arrive?

186
00:11:21,738 --> 00:11:24,658
Larry called. He's got another buyer
for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.

187
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,309
Do you want it?
Yes or no.

188
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:29,229
Is it a good representation
of his spring period?

189
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,773
No. The Springs was actually the
neighborhood in East Hampton

190
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,108
where he lived and worked,

191
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:34,734
- not "spring" like the season.
- So?

192
00:11:34,776 --> 00:11:36,945
I think it's a fair example.

193
00:11:37,028 --> 00:11:38,780
I think it's
incredibly overpriced.

194
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:43,285
I need it. Buy it. Store it.

195
00:11:43,368 --> 00:11:45,954
Okay. The MIT
commencement speech...

196
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,890
Is in June. Please, don't harangue me
about stuff that's way, way, down...

197
00:11:48,915 --> 00:11:51,334
They're haranguing me,
so I'm gonna say yes.

198
00:11:51,418 --> 00:11:52,919
Deflect it and absorb it.
Don't transmit it back to me.

199
00:11:52,961 --> 00:11:54,546
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.

200
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:56,339
What are you trying to get rid of me for?
What, you got plans?

201
00:11:56,423 --> 00:11:57,507
As a matter of fact, I do.

202
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:58,991
I don't like it when
you have plans.

203
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,094
I'm allowed to have
plans on my birthday.

204
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:02,762
- It's your birthday?
- Yes.

205
00:12:02,804 --> 00:12:04,306
I knew that. Already?

206
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:08,768
Yeah. Isn't that strange?
It's the same day as last year.

207
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,853
Get yourself something
nice from me.

208
00:12:09,936 --> 00:12:11,062
I already did.

209
00:12:11,146 --> 00:12:12,314
And?

210
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:14,024
Oh, it was very nice.

211
00:12:14,107 --> 00:12:17,861
- Yeah.
- Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.

212
00:12:17,944 --> 00:12:20,238
You're welcome, Miss Potts.

213
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:24,408
Okay.

214
00:12:42,844 --> 00:12:46,973
You're good. Oh, I thought
I lost you back there.

215
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:51,186
You did, sir. I had to
cut across Mulholland.

216
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:52,604
I got you. I got you.

217
00:12:52,687 --> 00:12:54,105
What's wrong with you?

218
00:12:54,189 --> 00:12:55,690
- What?
- Three hours.

219
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,943
<i>I got caught doing a
piece for Vanity Fair.</i>

220
00:12:58,026 --> 00:13:00,028
For three hours. For three hours
you got me standing here.

221
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,240
Waiting on you now. Let's go.
Come on.

222
00:13:03,323 --> 00:13:05,283
Wheels up! Rock and roll!

223
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,961
- What you reading, platypus?
- Nothing.

224
00:13:16,044 --> 00:13:18,255
Come on, sour patch.
Don't be mad.

225
00:13:18,338 --> 00:13:21,049
I told you, I'm not mad.
I'm indifferent, okay?

226
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:22,592
- I said I was sorry.
- Good morning, Mr. Stark.

227
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,802
You don't need to apologize
to me. I'm your man.

228
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:25,053
Hi. I told him I was
sorry, but he...

229
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:26,388
- I'm just indifferent right now.
- Hot towel?

230
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:27,681
You don't respect yourself,

231
00:13:27,722 --> 00:13:29,099
- so I know you don't respect me.
- I respect you.

232
00:13:29,182 --> 00:13:30,559
I'm just your babysitter.

233
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,144
So, when you need your
diaper changed... Thank you.

234
00:13:33,228 --> 00:13:35,397
Let me know and I'll get
you a bottle, okay?

235
00:13:35,438 --> 00:13:37,148
Hey! Heat up the
sake, will you?

236
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:38,608
- Thanks for reminding me.
- No, I'm not talking...

237
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,443
We're not drinking.
We're working right now.

238
00:13:40,447 --> 00:13:43,007
- You can't have sashimi without sake.
- You are constitutionally

239
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:44,656
incapable of being
responsible.

240
00:13:44,739 --> 00:13:46,116
It would be irresponsible
not to drink.

241
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:47,242
I'm just talking
about a nightcap.

242
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:48,410
Hot sake?

243
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:49,536
- Yes, two, please.
- No.

244
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,788
I'm not drinking.
I don't want any.

245
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,248
That's what I'm talking about.

246
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,334
When I get up in the morning
and I'm putting on my uniform,

247
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,253
you know what I recognize?

248
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:03,592
I see in that mirror that every person
that's got this uniform on got my back!

249
00:14:03,633 --> 00:14:06,344
Hey, you know what?
I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...

250
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,929
No, no. You don't
have to be like me!

251
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,514
But you're more
than what you are.

252
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,439
Can you excuse me if I'm
a bit distracted here?

253
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:14,603
No! You can't be distracted right now!
Listen to me!

254
00:14:31,244 --> 00:14:32,829
General.

255
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,916
Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward
to your weapons presentation.

256
00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:37,042
Thanks.

257
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:41,838
Is it better to be
feared or respected?

258
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:45,842
I say, is it too much
to ask for both?

259
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,887
With that in mind, I humbly
present the crown jewel

260
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,764
of Stark Industries'
Freedom Line.

261
00:14:50,805 --> 00:14:52,182
It's the first missile system

262
00:14:52,265 --> 00:14:54,809
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.

263
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:58,855
They say the best weapon is
one you never have to fire.

264
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,941
I respectfully disagree.

265
00:15:00,982 --> 00:15:05,278
I prefer the weapon you
only have to fire once.

266
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,241
That's how Dad did it.
That's how America does it.

267
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:11,493
And it's worked out
pretty well so far.

268
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,953
Find an excuse

269
00:15:12,994 --> 00:15:16,289
to let one of these off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you

270
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:19,668
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.

271
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:41,940
For your consideration,
the Jericho.

272
00:15:53,646 --> 00:15:54,886
I'll be throwing
one of these in

273
00:15:54,911 --> 00:15:56,830
with every purchase of
500 million or more.

274
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:57,872
To peace!

275
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,710
- <i>Tony.
- Obie, what are you doing up?</i>

276
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:04,379
<i>I couldn't sleep till I found
out how it went. How'd it go?</i>

277
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,256
It went great.
Looks like it's gonna be an early Christmas.

278
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:10,218
<i>Hey! Way to go, my boy!
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?</i>

279
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,720
Why aren't you wearing
those pajamas I got you?

280
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:13,638
<i>Good night, Tony.</i>

281
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,267
- Hey, Tony.
- I'm sorry, this is the "fun-vee."

282
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,186
The "hum-drum-vee"
is back there.

283
00:16:19,227 --> 00:16:20,729
Nice job.

284
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:22,063
See you back at base.

285
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,966
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

286
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,337
What the hell did
you do to me?

287
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:11,840
What I did?

288
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,260
What I did is to
save your life.

289
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:19,014
I removed all the shrapnel I
could, but there's a lot left,

290
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:20,807
and it's headed into
your atrial septum.

291
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,977
Here, want to see?

292
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,521
I have a souvenir.
Take a look.

293
00:18:29,524 --> 00:18:31,735
I've seen many wounds
like that in my village.

294
00:18:31,818 --> 00:18:34,237
We call them the walking dead

295
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,532
because it takes about a week for the
barbs to reach the vital organs.

296
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,202
- What is this?
- That is an electromagnet,

297
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,288
hooked up to a car battery,

298
00:18:43,371 --> 00:18:46,041
and it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart. Hmm?

299
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:56,343
That's right. Smile.

300
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:02,974
We met once, you know, at a
technical conference in Bern.

301
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,894
- I don't remember.
- No, you wouldn't.

302
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:09,022
If I had been that drunk, I
wouldn't have been able to stand,

303
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:12,275
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.

304
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,194
Where are we?

305
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,405
Come on, stand up.
Stand up!

306
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,117
Just do as I do.

307
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,911
Come on, put your hands up.

308
00:19:24,836 --> 00:19:26,556
Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?

309
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:28,750
Do you understand me?
Do as I do.

310
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:53,608
He says, "Welcome, Tony Stark,
the most famous mass murderer"

311
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,026
"in the history of America."

312
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,365
He is honored.

313
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,411
He wants you to
build the missile.

314
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,206
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.

315
00:20:12,043 --> 00:20:13,086
This one.

316
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,300
I refuse.

317
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,020
<i>Tony!</i>

318
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:24,282
He wants to know
what you think.

319
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,766
I think you got a
lot of my weapons.

320
00:21:35,126 --> 00:21:39,840
He says they have everything you
need to build the Jericho missile.

321
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,758
He wants you to make
the list of materials.

322
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,848
He says for you to start
working immediately,

323
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,976
and when you're done,
he will set you free.

324
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,730
No, he won't.

325
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,481
No, he won't.

326
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,456
I'm sure they're looking
for you, Stark.

327
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,168
But they will never find
you in these mountains.

328
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:21,673
Look, what you just saw,

329
00:22:22,757 --> 00:22:24,676
that is your legacy, Stark.

330
00:22:26,469 --> 00:22:29,890
Your life's work, in the
hands of those murderers.

331
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,726
Is that how you
want to go out?

332
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:38,398
Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?

333
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,108
Or are you going to do
something about it?

334
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:45,280
Why should I do anything?
They're going to kill me, you, either way.

335
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,533
And if they don't, I'll
probably be dead in a week.

336
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,535
Well, then,

337
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,330
this is a very important
week for you, isn't it?

338
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,458
Hmm?

339
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,020
If this is going
to be my work station,

340
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,284
I want
it well-lit. I want these up.

341
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:03,381
I need welding gear. I don't care
if it's acetylene or propane.

342
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,634
I need a soldering station. I need
helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.

343
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,135
I would like a smelting cup.

344
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,580
I need two sets of
precision tools.

345
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,443
How many languages
do you speak?

346
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,611
A lot.

347
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,322
But apparently, not
enough for this place.

348
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,491
They speak Arabic, Urdu,

349
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:32,577
Dari, Pashto, Mongolian,
Farsi, Russian.

350
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,330
Who are these people?

351
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:39,000
They are your loyal
customers, sir.

352
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,669
They call themselves
the Ten Rings.

353
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,013
You know, we might
be more productive

354
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:54,850
if you include me in
the planning process.

355
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,016
Uh-huh.

356
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,569
Okay, we don't need this.

357
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,780
What is that?

358
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,535
That's palladium, 0.15 grams.

359
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,788
We need at least 1.6, so why don't
you go break down the other 11?

360
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,668
What's he doing?

361
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,545
Working.

362
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,516
Careful. Careful, we only
get one shot at this.

363
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:40,187
Relax. I have steady hands.

364
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,689
Why do you think you're still alive?
Huh?

365
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,031
What do I call you?

366
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,866
My name is Yinsen.

367
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,327
Yinsen. Nice to meet you.

368
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,038
Nice to meet you, too.

369
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,664
That doesn't look like
a Jericho missile.

370
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:44,209
That's because it's a
miniaturized arc reactor.

371
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:47,295
I got a big one powering
my factory at home.

372
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,131
It should keep the
shrapnel out of my heart.

373
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,925
But what could it generate?

374
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:56,972
If my math is right, and it always
is, three gigajoules per second.

375
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,516
That could run your
heart for 50 lifetimes.

376
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,477
Yeah. Or something
big for 15 minutes.

377
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,989
This is our ticket
out of here.

378
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,657
What is it?

379
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,993
Flatten them out and look.

380
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:21,704
Oh, wow.

381
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,126
Impressive.

382
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,321
Good.

383
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:57,782
Good roll. Good roll.

384
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,701
You still haven't told
me where you're from.

385
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:03,163
I'm from a small
town called Gulmira.

386
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:04,664
It's actually a nice place.

387
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,500
Got a family?

388
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:10,879
Yes, and I will see
them when I leave here.

389
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,048
And you, Stark?

390
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,385
No.

391
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,054
No?

392
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,934
So you're a man who
has everything

393
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:25,936
and nothing.

394
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:14,817
It doesn't look anything like the picture.

395
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,502
Maybe it's been modified.

396
00:28:16,587 --> 00:28:18,812
- The tail is wrong.
- It's just backwards.

397
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:05,493
Relax.

398
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,005
The bow and arrow

399
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:19,466
once was the pinnacle
of weapons technology.

400
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:25,639
It allowed the
great Genghis Khan

401
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,184
to rule from the Pacific
to the Ukraine.

402
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:34,064
An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great

403
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:37,526
and four times the size
of the Roman Empire.

404
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,406
But today,

405
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,701
whoever holds the
latest Stark weapons

406
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,704
rules these lands.

407
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,500
And soon,

408
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,046
it will be my turn.

409
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,235
Why have you failed me?

410
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,380
We're working.

411
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,148
Diligently.

412
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,150
I let you live.

413
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,362
This is how you repay me?

414
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:26,365
It's very complex.

415
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,076
He's trying very hard.

416
00:30:29,511 --> 00:30:31,053
On his knees.

417
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:37,192
You think I'm a fool?

418
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:39,178
I'll get the truth.

419
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,422
We're both working.

420
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,764
Open your mouth.

421
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:49,855
What does he want?
Open your mouth.

422
00:30:49,855 --> 00:30:50,764
What does he want?

423
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:53,467
You think I'm a fool?

424
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,648
What's going on?

425
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:01,651
Tell me the truth.

426
00:31:02,218 --> 00:31:04,561
- He's building your Jericho.
- Tell me the truth.

427
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,408
What do you want?
A delivery date?

428
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,292
I need him.

429
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:20,629
Good assistant.

430
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:29,596
You have till tomorrow
to assemble my missile.

431
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,455
Okay?
Can you move?

432
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,374
Okay, say it again.

433
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,960
41 steps straight ahead.
Then 16 steps,

434
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:45,255
that's from the door, fork
right, 33 steps, turn right.

435
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,713
Where is Stark?

436
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:58,366
- He was here a moment ago.
- Go look for him.

437
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:16,661
Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!

438
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,413
Say something.
Say something back to him.

439
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:20,855
- He's speaking Hungarian. I don't...
- Then speak Hungarian.

440
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,125
Okay. I know.

441
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:23,919
What do you know?

442
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,110
- How'd that work?
- Oh, my goodness.

443
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,834
- It worked all right.
- That's what I do.

444
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:53,824
- Let me finish this.
- Initialize the power sequence.

445
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:54,907
Okay.

446
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:57,160
- Now!
- Tell me. Tell me.

447
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:59,037
Function 11.

448
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,164
Tell me when you see
a progress bar.

449
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,609
- It should be up right now.
- Yes.

450
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,792
Talk to me. Tell me
when you see it.

451
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,418
- I have it.
- Press Control "I".

452
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,921
- I. Got it.
- I. Enter. I and "Enter."

453
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,006
Come over here and
button me up.

454
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:13,969
Okay. All right.

455
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,387
Every other hex bolt.

456
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,556
- They're coming!
- Nothing pretty, just get it done.

457
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,079
- Just get it done.
- They're coming.

458
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:23,787
Make sure the checkpoints are clear
before you follow me out, okay?

459
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,438
We need more time.

460
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,483
Hey,

461
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:29,943
I'm gonna go buy
you some time.

462
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,444
Stick to the plan!

463
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:33,947
Stick to the plan!

464
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:36,866
Yinsen!

465
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:30,999
Yinsen!

466
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,125
Watch out!

467
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:48,349
Stark.

468
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,562
Come on. We got to go.

469
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:55,524
Move for me, come on. We got a
plan. We're gonna stick to it.

470
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,943
This was always
the plan, Stark.

471
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,946
Come on, you're gonna go
see your family. Get up.

472
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:04,366
My family is dead.

473
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,701
I'm going to see
them now, Stark.

474
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:10,622
It's okay.

475
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,544
I want this. I want this.

476
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,176
Thank you for saving me.

477
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:28,932
Don't waste it.
Don't waste your life.

478
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:09,138
My turn.

479
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:53,617
Not bad.

480
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,735
Hey!

481
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:51,134
How was the "fun-vee"?

482
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:55,972
Next time, you ride
with me, okay?

483
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:28,797
Watch it, coming up here.

484
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:33,802
Are you kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.

485
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:40,307
Hmm.

486
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:45,772
Your eyes are red. A few tears
for your long-lost boss?

487
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:48,024
Tears of joy.
I hate job hunting.

488
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:50,026
Yeah, vacation's over.

489
00:42:52,154 --> 00:42:53,363
Where to, sir?

490
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:54,990
- Take us to the hospital, please, Happy.
- No.

491
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:56,158
No?
Tony, you have to

492
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,826
- go to the hospital.
- No is a complete answer.

493
00:42:57,868 --> 00:42:59,077
- The doctor has to look at you.
- I don't have to do anything.

494
00:42:59,161 --> 00:43:00,829
I've been in captivity
for three months.

495
00:43:00,871 --> 00:43:04,708
There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger,

496
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,501
- and the other...
- That's enough of that.

497
00:43:06,585 --> 00:43:08,295
Is not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.

498
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:09,816
- Call for a press conference?
- Yeah.

499
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:12,215
- What on earth for?
- Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.

500
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:26,188
Look at this!

501
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:29,273
Tony.

502
00:43:31,731 --> 00:43:33,211
We were going to meet
at the hospital.

503
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:34,696
No, I'm fine.

504
00:43:34,738 --> 00:43:36,865
Look at you!

505
00:43:36,907 --> 00:43:39,326
- You had to have a burger, yeah?
- Well, come on.

506
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:40,535
You get me one of those?

507
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:41,899
There's only one left.
I need it.

508
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:47,417
Hey, look who's here!
Yeah!

509
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:54,508
- Miss Potts?
- Yes.

510
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:55,842
Can I speak to you
for a moment?

511
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:58,053
I'm not part of the
press conference,

512
00:43:58,094 --> 00:43:59,415
but it's about to
begin right now.

513
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:00,889
I'm not a reporter.

514
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:02,474
I'm agent Phil Coulson,

515
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,309
with the Strategic Homeland
Intervention, Enforcement

516
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:05,727
and Logistics Division.

517
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:07,312
That's quite a mouthful.

518
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,064
I know. We're working on it.

519
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:13,360
You know, we've been approached already
by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...

520
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:17,072
We're a separate division
with a more specific focus.

521
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:20,867
We need to debrief Mr. Stark about
the circumstances of his escape.

522
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:22,470
I'll put something in
the book, shall I?

523
00:44:22,536 --> 00:44:23,829
Thank you.

524
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:26,872
<i>Uh...</i>

525
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:31,586
Hey, would it be all right
if everyone sat down?

526
00:44:31,628 --> 00:44:35,173
Why don't you just sit down?
That way you can see me, and I can...

527
00:44:35,257 --> 00:44:37,217
A little less formal and...

528
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,473
What's up with the love-in?

529
00:44:43,557 --> 00:44:44,933
Don't look at me.

530
00:44:44,975 --> 00:44:47,060
I don't know what he's up to.

531
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:48,311
Good to see you.

532
00:44:48,395 --> 00:44:49,563
Good to see you.

533
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:52,232
I never got to say
goodbye to Dad.

534
00:44:52,274 --> 00:44:54,943
I never got to say
goodbye to my father.

535
00:44:58,456 --> 00:45:00,257
There's questions that I
would have asked him.

536
00:45:00,282 --> 00:45:02,784
I would have asked him how he
felt about what this company did.

537
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:08,498
If he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.

538
00:45:08,582 --> 00:45:12,794
Or maybe he was every inch the man
we all remember from the newsreels.

539
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:20,135
I saw young Americans killed

540
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:23,972
by the very weapons I created to
defend them and protect them.

541
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:28,185
And I saw

542
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:33,106
that I had become part of a system that
is comfortable with zero accountability.

543
00:45:33,148 --> 00:45:35,817
- Mr. Stark!
- Hey, Ben.

544
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:38,653
What happened over there?

545
00:45:38,695 --> 00:45:42,365
I had my eyes opened. I came
to realize that I have more

546
00:45:42,449 --> 00:45:46,828
to offer this world than just
making things that blow up.

547
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:50,415
<i>And that is why, effective
immediately, I am shutting down</i>

548
00:45:50,499 --> 00:45:54,169
<i>the weapons manufacturing
division of Stark International</i>

549
00:45:54,211 --> 00:45:58,256
<i>until such a time as I can decide what
the future of the company will be.</i>

550
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,050
<i>I think we're gonna be
selling a lot of newspapers.</i>

551
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:01,843
<i>What direction it should take,
one that I'm comfortable with</i>

552
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:05,931
<i>and is consistent with the highest
good for this country, as well.</i>

553
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:12,395
<i>What we should take away from
this is that Tony's back!</i>

554
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:15,106
<i>And he's healthier than ever.</i>

555
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:18,318
<i>We're going to have a
little internal discussion</i>

556
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,695
<i>and we'll get back to
you with the follow-up.</i>

557
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:25,075
- Where is he?
- He's inside.

558
00:46:36,169 --> 00:46:39,005
Well, that... That went well.

559
00:46:39,047 --> 00:46:41,216
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?

560
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:43,885
Your head?
What about my head?

561
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:46,972
What do you think the over-under on
the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?

562
00:46:47,055 --> 00:46:48,598
Uh, optimistically, 40 points.

563
00:46:48,682 --> 00:46:49,975
At minimum.

564
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:51,810
Yep.

565
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:55,146
Tony, we're a weapons
manufacturer.

566
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:57,899
Obie, I just don't want a body
count to be our only legacy.

567
00:46:57,941 --> 00:47:00,569
That's what we do. We're iron
mongers. We make weapons.

568
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:02,070
It's my name on the
side of the building.

569
00:47:02,154 --> 00:47:04,573
And what we do keeps the world
from falling into chaos.

570
00:47:04,656 --> 00:47:06,199
Not based on what I saw.

571
00:47:07,868 --> 00:47:09,202
We're not doing a
good enough job.

572
00:47:09,244 --> 00:47:10,203
We can do better.
We're gonna do something else.

573
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:11,454
Like what?

574
00:47:11,538 --> 00:47:14,082
You want us to
make baby bottles?

575
00:47:14,166 --> 00:47:17,419
I think we should take another
look into arc reactor technology.

576
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:22,090
Ah, come on. The arc reactor,
that's a publicity stunt!

577
00:47:22,132 --> 00:47:25,260
Tony, come on. We built that
thing to shut the hippies up!

578
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:28,889
- It works.
- Yeah, as a science project.

579
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,432
The arc was never
cost effective.

580
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:32,267
We knew that before
we built it.

581
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:35,437
Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

582
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,105
Maybe.

583
00:47:37,189 --> 00:47:39,774
Huh? Am I right? We haven't had
a breakthrough in that in what?

584
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:41,860
- 30 years.
- That's what they say.

585
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:47,257
Could you have a lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?

586
00:47:47,282 --> 00:47:50,494
- Never mind who told me. Show me.
- It's Rhodey or Pepper.

587
00:47:50,577 --> 00:47:52,829
- I want to see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.

588
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:02,756
- Okay.
- Okay?

589
00:48:06,134 --> 00:48:07,302
It works.

590
00:48:11,473 --> 00:48:15,644
Listen to me, Tony. We're a
team. Do you understand?

591
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:18,980
There's nothing we can't
do if we stick together,

592
00:48:19,064 --> 00:48:20,482
like your father and I.

593
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:22,359
I'm sorry I didn't give
you a heads-up, okay?

594
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:23,985
- But if I had...
- Tony.

595
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:27,113
Tony, no more of this "ready,
fire, aim" business.

596
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:30,450
- You understand me?
- That was Dad's line.

597
00:48:30,492 --> 00:48:32,661
You gotta let me handle this.

598
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:35,163
We're gonna have to play a whole
different kind of ball now.

599
00:48:35,247 --> 00:48:37,082
We're going to have to
take a lot of heat.

600
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:40,627
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.

601
00:48:40,669 --> 00:48:42,462
<i>Stark Industries!</i>

602
00:48:42,504 --> 00:48:45,382
<i>I've got one recommendation!
Ready? Ready?</i>

603
00:48:45,465 --> 00:48:46,758
<i>Sell, sell, sell!</i>

604
00:48:46,842 --> 00:48:48,844
<i>Abandon ship!</i>

605
00:48:48,885 --> 00:48:52,305
<i>Does the Hindenburg
ring any bells?</i>

606
00:48:54,057 --> 00:49:00,105
<i>Let me show you the new Stark
Industries business plan!</i>

607
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:03,525
<i>Look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!</i>

608
00:49:04,985 --> 00:49:07,988
<i>Pepper.
How big are your hands?</i>

609
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:10,282
- <i>What?
- How big are your hands?</i>

610
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:13,201
- <i>I don't understand why...
- Get down here. I need you.</i>

611
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:21,626
Hey.

612
00:49:23,712 --> 00:49:26,256
Let's see them.
Show me your hands.

613
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:27,632
Let's see them.

614
00:49:27,716 --> 00:49:30,594
Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

615
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:33,930
I just need your
help for a sec.

616
00:49:34,014 --> 00:49:36,224
Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

617
00:49:36,266 --> 00:49:39,561
It was. It is now an antique.

618
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:42,439
This is what will be keeping me
alive for the foreseeable future.

619
00:49:42,522 --> 00:49:44,524
I'm swapping it up for
an upgraded unit,

620
00:49:44,566 --> 00:49:47,319
and I just ran into a
little speed bump.

621
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:48,778
Speed bump, what
does that mean?

622
00:49:48,862 --> 00:49:50,197
It's nothing.
It's just a little snag.

623
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:53,617
There's an exposed wire
under this device.

624
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,828
And it's contacting the socket wall
and causing a little bit of a short.

625
00:49:56,912 --> 00:49:59,414
It's fine.

626
00:49:59,456 --> 00:50:01,416
- What do you want me to do?
- Put that on the table over there.

627
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:03,251
- That is irrelevant.
- Oh, my God!

628
00:50:03,335 --> 00:50:08,340
I want you to reach in, and you're
just gonna gently lift the wire out.

629
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:10,467
- Is it safe?
- Yeah, it should be fine.

630
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,219
It's like Operation.
You just don't let it touch

631
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,637
the socket wall or
it goes "beep."

632
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,880
What do you mean, "Operation"?

633
00:50:14,888 --> 00:50:16,223
It's just a game, never mind.

634
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:20,268
- Just gently lift the wire. Okay? Great.
- Okay.

635
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:24,648
You know, I don't think that
I'm qualified to do this.

636
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:28,777
No, you're fine. You're the
most capable, qualified,

637
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:33,615
trustworthy person I've ever
met. You're gonna do great.

638
00:50:33,657 --> 00:50:35,617
Is it too much of a problem to ask?
'Cause I'm...

639
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,370
- Okay, okay.
- I really need your help here.

640
00:50:38,453 --> 00:50:39,453
Okay.

641
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:45,502
Oh, there's pus!

642
00:50:45,585 --> 00:50:50,215
It's not pus. It's an inorganic
plasmic discharge from the device,

643
00:50:50,298 --> 00:50:52,217
- not from my body.
- It smells!

644
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,135
Yeah, it does.

645
00:50:54,177 --> 00:50:55,512
The copper wire.

646
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:56,888
The copper wire, you got it?

647
00:50:56,972 --> 00:50:58,098
- Okay, I got it! I got it!
- Okay, you got it?

648
00:50:58,139 --> 00:50:59,474
Now, don't let it.

649
00:50:59,558 --> 00:51:01,101
Touch the sides
when you're coming out!

650
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:02,477
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

651
00:51:02,561 --> 00:51:04,146
That's what I was trying
to tell you before.

652
00:51:04,187 --> 00:51:05,897
Okay, now make sure that when
you pull it out, you don't...

653
00:51:05,981 --> 00:51:07,822
There's a magnet at the end of it!
That was it.

654
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:08,942
You
just pulled it out.

655
00:51:08,984 --> 00:51:10,610
- Oh, God!
- Okay, I was not expecting...

656
00:51:10,652 --> 00:51:12,362
- Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in!
- Okay, what do I do?

657
00:51:12,445 --> 00:51:14,364
What's wrong?

658
00:51:14,447 --> 00:51:16,158
Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest
'cause you yanked it out like a trout...

659
00:51:16,241 --> 00:51:19,161
- What? You said it was safe!
- We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.

660
00:51:19,202 --> 00:51:21,454
- You gotta switch it out really quick.
- Okay. Okay.

661
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:23,331
- Tony? It's going to be okay.
- What?

662
00:51:23,336 --> 00:51:24,496
- Is it?
- It's gonna be okay.

663
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:27,586
- I'm gonna make this okay.
- Let's hope.

664
00:51:27,669 --> 00:51:31,715
Okay, you're gonna attach that to
the base plate. Make sure you...

665
00:51:35,844 --> 00:51:38,263
Was that so hard?
That was fun, right?

666
00:51:38,346 --> 00:51:39,890
Here, I got it. I got it.
Here.

667
00:51:40,557 --> 00:51:41,641
Nice.

668
00:51:41,683 --> 00:51:43,935
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I feel great.

669
00:51:44,019 --> 00:51:45,228
You okay?

670
00:51:46,688 --> 00:51:49,608
Don't ever, ever, ever,

671
00:51:49,691 --> 00:51:52,694
ever ask me to do anything
like that ever again.

672
00:51:52,736 --> 00:51:54,613
I don't have anyone but you.

673
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:01,535
Anyway...

674
00:52:07,459 --> 00:52:08,919
What do you want me
to do with this?

675
00:52:09,002 --> 00:52:10,002
That?

676
00:52:11,213 --> 00:52:12,464
Destroy it.

677
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:15,217
Incinerate it.

678
00:52:15,258 --> 00:52:16,927
You don't want to keep it?

679
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:21,556
Pepper, I've been called many things.
"Nostalgic" is not one of them.

680
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,058
Will that be all, Mr. Stark?

681
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:24,768
That will be all, Miss Potts.

682
00:52:26,061 --> 00:52:27,813
Hey, Butterfingers, come here.

683
00:52:27,896 --> 00:52:29,815
What's all this stuff
doing on top of my desk?

684
00:52:29,898 --> 00:52:33,068
That's my phone, that's a
picture of me and my dad.

685
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:35,779
Right there. In the garbage.
All that stuff.

686
00:52:42,244 --> 00:52:46,748
The future of air combat.
Is it manned or unmanned?

687
00:52:46,832 --> 00:52:48,959
I'll tell you, in
my experience,

688
00:52:49,042 --> 00:52:54,089
no unmanned aerial vehicle will
ever trump a pilot's instinct,

689
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:55,590
his insight,

690
00:52:55,632 --> 00:52:58,510
that ability to look into a
situation beyond the obvious

691
00:52:58,593 --> 00:53:02,264
and discern its outcome,
or a pilot's judgment.

692
00:53:02,347 --> 00:53:03,473
Colonel?

693
00:53:03,557 --> 00:53:05,392
Why not a pilot
without the plane?

694
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:07,477
Look who fell out of the sky.
Mr. Tony Stark.

695
00:53:07,561 --> 00:53:09,437
- Hello, sir.
- Speaking of manned or unmanned,

696
00:53:09,521 --> 00:53:11,398
you gotta get him to tell you
about the time he guessed wrong

697
00:53:11,439 --> 00:53:14,109
at spring break. Just remember
that, spring break, 1987.

698
00:53:14,151 --> 00:53:15,443
- That lovely lady you woke up with.
- Don't do that!

699
00:53:15,527 --> 00:53:16,967
- What was his name?
- Don't do that.

700
00:53:16,987 --> 00:53:18,113
- Was it Ivan?
- Don't do that.

701
00:53:18,155 --> 00:53:19,406
They'll believe it.
Don't do that.

702
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:20,949
- Okay.
- Don't do that.

703
00:53:20,993 --> 00:53:23,393
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Give us a couple minutes, you guys.

704
00:53:26,121 --> 00:53:27,789
- I'm surprised.
- Why?

705
00:53:27,873 --> 00:53:31,126
I swear, I didn't expect to see
you walking around so soon.

706
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:33,044
I'm doing a little
better than walking.

707
00:53:33,128 --> 00:53:35,213
- Really?
- Yeah.

708
00:53:35,297 --> 00:53:38,008
Rhodey, I'm working
on something big.

709
00:53:38,091 --> 00:53:42,179
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be a part of it.

710
00:53:42,181 --> 00:53:44,781
You're about to make a whole lot
of people around here real happy,

711
00:53:44,806 --> 00:53:47,809
'cause that little stunt
at the press conference,

712
00:53:47,893 --> 00:53:49,811
that was a doozy.

713
00:53:49,853 --> 00:53:54,399
This is not for the military.
I'm not... It's different.

714
00:53:54,483 --> 00:53:57,110
What? You're a humanitarian
now or something?

715
00:53:57,152 --> 00:53:58,612
- I need you to listen to me.
- No.

716
00:53:58,653 --> 00:54:02,282
What you need is time
to get your mind right.

717
00:54:04,493 --> 00:54:06,077
- I'm serious.
- Okay.

718
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:11,166
It's nice seeing you, Tony.

719
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:12,334
Thanks.

720
00:54:20,717 --> 00:54:22,427
Jarvis, you up?

721
00:54:22,511 --> 00:54:24,346
<i>For you, sir, always.</i>

722
00:54:24,387 --> 00:54:29,392
I'd like to open a new project
file, index as Mark Two.

723
00:54:29,476 --> 00:54:33,355
<i>Shall I store this on the Stark
Industries Central Database?</i>

724
00:54:33,438 --> 00:54:35,857
Actually, I don't know
who to trust right now.

725
00:54:35,899 --> 00:54:37,484
Till further notice, why don't
we just keep everything

726
00:54:37,526 --> 00:54:38,944
on my private server?

727
00:54:39,027 --> 00:54:41,446
<i>Working on a secret
project, are we, sir?</i>

728
00:54:45,492 --> 00:54:48,370
I don't want this winding
up in the wrong hands.

729
00:54:50,705 --> 00:54:52,874
Maybe in mine, it can
actually do some good.

730
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:39,754
Next. Up.

731
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:42,757
Not in the boot, Dummy.
Right here. You got me?

732
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:44,801
Stay put. Nice.

733
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,932
You're of no benefit at all.
Move down to the toe. I got this.

734
00:55:51,016 --> 00:55:52,809
Okay, I'm sorry,
am I in your way?

735
00:56:00,066 --> 00:56:01,066
Up.

736
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:03,987
Screw it. Don't even move.

737
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:06,907
You are a tragedy.

738
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:20,128
<i>Okay, let's do this right.</i>

739
00:56:20,212 --> 00:56:22,631
<i>Start mark, half a meter,
and back and center.</i>

740
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,011
<i>Dummy, look alive.
You're on standby for fire safety.</i>

741
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:29,513
You, roll it.

742
00:56:31,848 --> 00:56:35,393
<i>Okay. Activate hand controls.</i>

743
00:56:39,731 --> 00:56:41,316
<i>We're gonna start
off nice and easy.</i>

744
00:56:41,399 --> 00:56:44,152
<i>We're gonna see if 10% thrust
capacity achieves lift.</i>

745
00:56:44,194 --> 00:56:45,570
<i>And three,</i>

746
00:56:46,404 --> 00:56:47,404
<i>two,</i>

747
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,240
<i>one.</i>

748
00:57:26,486 --> 00:57:28,822
Up two. All right, set that.

749
00:57:28,864 --> 00:57:31,199
I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?

750
00:57:31,241 --> 00:57:33,201
Yeah, everything's... What?

751
00:57:33,285 --> 00:57:34,661
- Obadiah's upstairs.
- Great!

752
00:57:34,703 --> 00:57:36,496
- What would you like me to tell him?
- Great. I'll be right up.

753
00:57:37,038 --> 00:57:38,957
Okay.

754
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,792
I thought you said you
were done making weapons.

755
00:57:40,876 --> 00:57:42,377
It is.

756
00:57:42,419 --> 00:57:45,505
This is a flight stabilizer.
It's completely harmless.

757
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:51,386
I didn't expect that.

758
00:57:56,558 --> 00:57:57,559
How'd it go?

759
00:58:00,228 --> 00:58:01,897
It went that bad, huh?

760
00:58:01,938 --> 00:58:04,691
Just because I brought
pizza back from New York

761
00:58:04,733 --> 00:58:08,653
- doesn't mean it went bad.
- Uh-huh. Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

762
00:58:08,737 --> 00:58:11,781
- It would have gone better if you were there.
- Uh-uh.

763
00:58:11,865 --> 00:58:13,408
You told me to lay low.
That's what I've been doing.

764
00:58:13,492 --> 00:58:15,744
- I lay low, and you take care of all...
- Hey, come on.

765
00:58:15,827 --> 00:58:19,039
In public. The press.

766
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,583
This was a board of
directors meeting.

767
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:24,252
This was a board of
directors meeting?

768
00:58:24,294 --> 00:58:26,755
The board is claiming you
have posttraumatic stress.

769
00:58:26,838 --> 00:58:27,998
They're filing an injunction.

770
00:58:28,048 --> 00:58:30,091
- A what?
- They want to lock you out.

771
00:58:30,175 --> 00:58:31,426
Why, 'cause the stocks
dipped 40 points?

772
00:58:31,468 --> 00:58:32,469
We knew that was gonna happen.

773
00:58:32,552 --> 00:58:34,638
- Fifty-six and a half.
- It doesn't matter.

774
00:58:34,721 --> 00:58:36,932
We own the controlling
interest in the company.

775
00:58:37,015 --> 00:58:40,602
Tony, the board
has rights, too.

776
00:58:40,644 --> 00:58:44,523
They're making the case that
you and your new direction

777
00:58:44,606 --> 00:58:46,858
- isn't in the company's best interest.
- I'm being responsible!

778
00:58:46,942 --> 00:58:50,779
That's a new direction
for me, for the company.

779
00:58:50,862 --> 00:58:54,783
I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...

780
00:58:54,825 --> 00:58:55,951
This is great.

781
00:58:56,034 --> 00:58:59,412
- Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.
- I'll be in the shop.

782
00:58:59,454 --> 00:59:01,665
Hey, hey!
Hey, Tony. Listen.

783
00:59:01,748 --> 00:59:05,168
I'm trying to turn this thing around,
but you gotta give me something.

784
00:59:05,252 --> 00:59:06,962
Something to pitch them.

785
00:59:07,003 --> 00:59:10,423
Let me have the engineers analyze
that. You know, draw up some specs.

786
00:59:10,465 --> 00:59:12,634
- No. No, absolutely not.
- It'll give me a bone to throw the boys

787
00:59:12,717 --> 00:59:14,302
- in New York!
- This one stays with me.

788
00:59:14,386 --> 00:59:15,470
That's it, Obie. Forget it.

789
00:59:15,554 --> 00:59:17,222
All right, well, this
stays with me, then.

790
00:59:17,305 --> 00:59:19,140
Go on, here, you
can have a piece.

791
00:59:19,224 --> 00:59:20,725
- Take two.
- Thank you.

792
00:59:20,809 --> 00:59:22,686
You mind if I come down there
and see what you're doing?

793
00:59:22,769 --> 00:59:24,980
Good night, Obie.

794
00:59:25,021 --> 00:59:29,818
Day 11, test 37, configuration
2.0. For lack of a better option,

795
00:59:29,901 --> 00:59:32,612
Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,

796
00:59:32,654 --> 00:59:35,490
and I'm not on fire, I'm
donating you to a city college.

797
00:59:35,574 --> 00:59:37,450
<i>All right, nice and easy.</i>

798
00:59:37,492 --> 00:59:42,122
<i>Seriously, just gonna start
off with 1% thrust capacity.</i>

799
00:59:43,957 --> 00:59:45,542
<i>And three, two, one.</i>

800
00:59:57,846 --> 00:59:58,846
Okay.

801
01:00:00,066 --> 01:00:01,867
Please don't follow me
around with it, either,

802
01:00:01,892 --> 01:00:04,311
'cause I feel like I'm gonna
catch on fire spontaneously.

803
01:00:04,352 --> 01:00:06,062
Just stand down!
If something happens, then come in.

804
01:00:06,146 --> 01:00:08,398
And again, let's
bring it up to 2.5.

805
01:00:08,482 --> 01:00:09,691
Three, two, one.

806
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:29,294
Okay, this is where
I don't want to be!

807
01:00:29,377 --> 01:00:30,712
Oh, not the car, not the car!

808
01:00:32,047 --> 01:00:33,047
Table!

809
01:00:44,059 --> 01:00:48,230
Could be worse! Could be worse!
We're fine! Okay.

810
01:01:06,414 --> 01:01:07,499
No! Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Uh!

811
01:01:09,918 --> 01:01:11,336
Yeah, I can fly.

812
01:01:16,383 --> 01:01:19,344
- <i>Jarvis, are you there?
- At your service, sir.</i>

813
01:01:19,427 --> 01:01:20,512
Engage Heads Up Display.

814
01:01:20,595 --> 01:01:21,638
<i>Check.</i>

815
01:01:21,721 --> 01:01:23,682
Import all preferences
from home interface.

816
01:01:23,765 --> 01:01:25,142
<i>Will do, sir.</i>

817
01:01:32,274 --> 01:01:33,942
All right, what do you say?

818
01:01:34,025 --> 01:01:36,903
<i>I have indeed been uploaded,
sir. We're online and ready.</i>

819
01:01:36,945 --> 01:01:38,655
Can we start the
virtual walk-around?

820
01:01:38,738 --> 01:01:41,658
<i>Importing preferences and
calibrating virtual environment.</i>

821
01:01:41,741 --> 01:01:43,034
Do a check on
control surfaces.

822
01:01:43,118 --> 01:01:44,452
<i>As you wish.</i>

823
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,144
<i>Test complete. Preparing to power
down and begin diagnostics.</i>

824
01:02:09,227 --> 01:02:12,147
Uh, yeah. Tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.

825
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:13,732
Start listening in
on ground control.

826
01:02:13,815 --> 01:02:15,317
<i>Sir, there are still terabytes</i>

827
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,569
<i>of calculations needed before
an actual flight is...</i>

828
01:02:17,652 --> 01:02:21,573
Jarvis! Sometimes you got
to run before you can walk.

829
01:02:21,656 --> 01:02:25,702
Ready?
In three, two, one.

830
01:02:49,226 --> 01:02:50,644
Handles like a dream.

831
01:03:19,096 --> 01:03:20,816
All right, let's see
what this thing can do.

832
01:03:20,841 --> 01:03:22,592
What's SR-71's record?

833
01:03:22,676 --> 01:03:26,471
<i>The altitude record for fixed
wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.</i>

834
01:03:26,555 --> 01:03:29,057
Records are made to be broken!
Come on!

835
01:03:32,394 --> 01:03:36,022
<i>Sir, there is a potentially
fatal buildup of ice occurring.</i>

836
01:03:36,064 --> 01:03:37,064
Keep going!

837
01:03:39,442 --> 01:03:40,777
Higher!

838
01:03:54,416 --> 01:03:58,670
We iced up, Jarvis!
Deploy flaps! Jarvis!

839
01:04:01,423 --> 01:04:03,884
Come on, we got
to break the ice!

840
01:04:39,085 --> 01:04:40,128
Kill power.

841
01:06:04,629 --> 01:06:08,049
Notes. Main transducer feels
sluggish at plus 40 altitude.

842
01:06:08,091 --> 01:06:09,926
Hull pressurization
is problematic.

843
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:12,512
I'm thinking icing is
the probable factor.

844
01:06:12,554 --> 01:06:14,806
<i>A very astute
observation, sir.</i>

845
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:16,691
<i>Perhaps, if you intend
to visit other planets,</i>

846
01:06:16,725 --> 01:06:18,310
<i>we should improve
the exosystems.</i>

847
01:06:18,393 --> 01:06:20,896
Connect to the sys. Co. Have it
reconfigure the shell metals.

848
01:06:20,937 --> 01:06:24,065
Use the gold titanium alloy from
the seraphim tactical satellite.

849
01:06:24,107 --> 01:06:25,901
That should ensure a
fuselage integrity

850
01:06:25,984 --> 01:06:27,986
while maintaining
power-to-weight ratio.

851
01:06:28,069 --> 01:06:29,362
- <i>Got it?
- Yes.</i>

852
01:06:29,404 --> 01:06:31,698
<i>Shall I render using
proposed specifications?</i>

853
01:06:31,823 --> 01:06:34,493
Thrill me.

854
01:06:34,576 --> 01:06:36,745
<i>Tonight's
red-hot red carpet</i>

855
01:06:36,786 --> 01:06:39,122
<i>is right here at the
Disney Concert Hall,</i>

856
01:06:39,206 --> 01:06:41,500
<i>where Tony Stark's
third annual benefit</i>

857
01:06:41,583 --> 01:06:43,460
<i>for the Firefighter's
Family Fund</i>

858
01:06:43,543 --> 01:06:45,086
<i>has become the place to be
for L.A.'s high society.</i>

859
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:46,491
Jarvis, we get an
invite for that?

860
01:06:46,546 --> 01:06:49,049
<i>I have no record
of an invitation, sir.</i>

861
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:50,691
<i>Hasn't
been seen in public</i>

862
01:06:50,717 --> 01:06:54,513
<i>since his bizarre and highly
controversial press conference.</i>

863
01:06:54,596 --> 01:06:57,265
<i>Some claim he's suffering
from posttraumatic stress</i>

864
01:06:57,307 --> 01:07:01,353
<i>and has been bedridden for
weeks. Whatever the case may be,</i>

865
01:07:01,436 --> 01:07:04,272
<i>no one expects an appearance
from him tonight.</i>

866
01:07:04,314 --> 01:07:06,483
<i>The render is complete.</i>

867
01:07:06,566 --> 01:07:08,276
A little ostentatious,
don't you think?

868
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:11,071
<i>What was I thinking?
You're usually so discreet.</i>

869
01:07:13,031 --> 01:07:15,659
Tell you what. Throw a
little hot-rod red in there.

870
01:07:15,742 --> 01:07:18,119
<i>Yes, that should help
you keep a low profile.</i>

871
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:24,084
<i>The render is complete.</i>

872
01:07:24,125 --> 01:07:26,044
Hey, I like it. Fabricate it.
Paint it.

873
01:07:26,127 --> 01:07:27,712
<i>Commencing automated assembly.</i>

874
01:07:27,796 --> 01:07:30,966
<i>Estimated completion
time is five hours.</i>

875
01:07:31,049 --> 01:07:32,170
Don't wait up for me, honey.

876
01:07:56,324 --> 01:08:00,120
Weapons manufacturing is only one
small part of what Stark Industries

877
01:08:00,162 --> 01:08:01,955
is all about, and
our partnership.

878
01:08:01,997 --> 01:08:04,238
With the
fire and rescue community...

879
01:08:06,668 --> 01:08:08,336
Hey, Tony, remember me?

880
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:09,420
Sure don't.

881
01:08:10,672 --> 01:08:11,672
You look great, Hef.

882
01:08:14,009 --> 01:08:15,468
We're going to have
a great quarter.

883
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:19,181
What's the world coming to when a
guy's got to crash his own party?

884
01:08:19,264 --> 01:08:23,435
Look at you. Hey,
what a surprise.

885
01:08:23,518 --> 01:08:25,770
I'll see you inside.

886
01:08:25,854 --> 01:08:29,149
Hey. Listen, take
it slow, all right?

887
01:08:29,191 --> 01:08:30,942
I think I got the board
right where we want them.

888
01:08:31,026 --> 01:08:34,404
You got it. Just cabin fever.
I'll just be a minute.

889
01:08:39,117 --> 01:08:40,619
Give me a Scotch.
I'm starving.

890
01:08:41,828 --> 01:08:43,330
Mr. Stark?

891
01:08:43,371 --> 01:08:45,540
- Yeah?
- Agent Coulson.

892
01:08:45,624 --> 01:08:47,876
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The guy from the...

893
01:08:47,918 --> 01:08:51,254
Strategic Homeland Intervention,
Enforcement and Logistics Division.

894
01:08:51,338 --> 01:08:52,756
God, you need
a new name for that.

895
01:08:52,839 --> 01:08:55,759
Yeah, I hear that a lot.

896
01:08:55,842 --> 01:08:59,596
Listen, I know this must be a trying time
for you, but we need to debrief you.

897
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:01,598
There's still a lot of
unanswered questions,

898
01:09:01,681 --> 01:09:03,266
and time can be a factor
with these things.

899
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:05,811
Let's just put something
on the books.

900
01:09:05,894 --> 01:09:09,564
How about the 24th at 7:00 P.M.
at Stark Industries?

901
01:09:09,606 --> 01:09:13,026
Tell you what. You got it.
You're absolutely right.

902
01:09:13,068 --> 01:09:17,239
Well, I'm going to go to my
assistant, and we'll make a date.

903
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:20,867
You look fantastic!
I didn't recognize you.

904
01:09:20,909 --> 01:09:23,245
- What are you doing here?
- Just avoiding government agents.

905
01:09:23,286 --> 01:09:25,080
- Are you by yourself?
- Yes. Where'd you get that dress?

906
01:09:25,163 --> 01:09:27,043
- Oh, it was a birthday present.
- That's great.

907
01:09:27,082 --> 01:09:29,209
- From you, actually.
- Well, I got great taste.

908
01:09:29,251 --> 01:09:30,544
Yes.

909
01:09:30,585 --> 01:09:32,504
- You want to dance?
- Oh, no.

910
01:09:32,587 --> 01:09:34,965
- All right, come on.
- Thank you. No.

911
01:09:45,517 --> 01:09:48,103
Am I making you uncomfortable?

912
01:09:48,145 --> 01:09:53,441
No. No. I always forget to wear
deodorant and dance with my boss

913
01:09:53,483 --> 01:09:57,529
in front of everyone that I work
with in a dress with no back.

914
01:09:57,612 --> 01:09:58,780
You look great and
you smell great.

915
01:09:58,822 --> 01:10:00,240
Oh, God.

916
01:10:00,282 --> 01:10:02,117
But I could fire you if that
would take the edge off.

917
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:05,829
I actually don't think that you
could tie your shoes without me.

918
01:10:05,912 --> 01:10:07,372
- I'd make it a week. Sure.
- Really?

919
01:10:07,455 --> 01:10:09,624
What's your Social
Security number?

920
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:15,130
- Five.
- Five?

921
01:10:16,006 --> 01:10:17,299
- Right.
- Right.

922
01:10:17,382 --> 01:10:19,759
You're missing just a
couple of digits there.

923
01:10:19,801 --> 01:10:22,637
The other eight?
So I got you for the other eight.

924
01:10:35,609 --> 01:10:37,777
- How about a little air?
- Yes, I need some air.

925
01:10:40,572 --> 01:10:42,491
- That was totally weird.
- Totally harmless.

926
01:10:42,574 --> 01:10:45,535
It was totally not
harmless, by the way.

927
01:10:45,619 --> 01:10:46,912
We're dancing.
No one's even watching.

928
01:10:46,995 --> 01:10:48,796
Everybody who I work with...
No, you know why?

929
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:52,000
I think you lost objectivity. I think
they just... People... We just danced.

930
01:10:52,083 --> 01:10:55,504
No, it was not just a dance.
You don't understand because you're you.

931
01:10:55,545 --> 01:10:58,381
And everybody knows
exactly who you are

932
01:10:58,465 --> 01:11:01,718
and how you are with girls and all
of that, which is completely fine.

933
01:11:01,801 --> 01:11:04,221
But, you know, then
me, you're my boss,

934
01:11:04,304 --> 01:11:06,306
- and I'm dancing with you.
- I don't think it was taken that way.

935
01:11:06,348 --> 01:11:09,226
Because it makes me look like
the one who's trying to...

936
01:11:09,309 --> 01:11:11,186
- I just think you're overstating it.
- You know, and we're here,

937
01:11:11,269 --> 01:11:15,065
and then I'm wearing
this ridiculous

938
01:11:15,148 --> 01:11:17,901
dress, and then we were
dancing like that and...

939
01:11:31,873 --> 01:11:34,751
I would like a drink, please.
Got it, okay.

940
01:11:36,127 --> 01:11:39,047
- I would like a vodka Martini, please.
- Okay.

941
01:11:39,130 --> 01:11:44,594
Very dry with olives, a lot of
olives. Like, at least three olives.

942
01:11:44,678 --> 01:11:47,722
Two vodka Martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.

943
01:11:47,806 --> 01:11:49,724
Make one of them
dirty, will you?

944
01:11:54,604 --> 01:11:57,482
Wow. Tony Stark.

945
01:11:57,566 --> 01:11:59,401
Oh, hey.
Fancy seeing you here.

946
01:12:03,989 --> 01:12:05,031
- Carrie.
- Christine.

947
01:12:05,073 --> 01:12:06,283
That's right.

948
01:12:06,366 --> 01:12:08,869
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.

949
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:10,328
Can I at least get a
reaction from you?

950
01:12:10,412 --> 01:12:12,873
Panic. I would say
panic is my reaction.

951
01:12:12,914 --> 01:12:14,291
'Cause I was referring
to your company's

952
01:12:14,374 --> 01:12:15,774
involvement in this
latest atrocity.

953
01:12:15,792 --> 01:12:17,043
Yeah. They just put my
name on the invitation.

954
01:12:17,085 --> 01:12:18,336
I don't know what to tell you.

955
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:20,755
I actually almost bought
it, hook, line and sinker.

956
01:12:20,799 --> 01:12:23,279
I was out of town for a couple
months, in case you didn't hear.

957
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:25,635
Is this what you
call accountability?

958
01:12:25,719 --> 01:12:28,430
It's a town called Gulmira.
Heard of it?

959
01:12:39,983 --> 01:12:41,193
When were these taken?

960
01:12:41,276 --> 01:12:42,819
Yesterday.

961
01:12:42,903 --> 01:12:44,946
- I didn't approve any shipment.
- Well, your company did.

962
01:12:44,988 --> 01:12:46,948
Well, I'm not my company.

963
01:12:48,074 --> 01:12:49,284
Please, do you mind?

964
01:12:49,367 --> 01:12:51,286
Have you seen these pictures?
Huh?

965
01:12:51,369 --> 01:12:52,746
- What's going on in Gulmira?
- Tony, Tony.

966
01:12:52,787 --> 01:12:54,331
You can't afford
to be this naive.

967
01:12:54,414 --> 01:12:56,124
You know what?
I was naive before,

968
01:12:56,208 --> 01:12:57,876
when they said, "Here's the
line. We don't cross it."

969
01:12:57,959 --> 01:12:59,544
"This is how we do business."

970
01:12:59,628 --> 01:13:03,256
If we're double-dealing
under the table... Are we?

971
01:13:03,298 --> 01:13:05,050
Tony, your picture, please!

972
01:13:07,677 --> 01:13:10,847
Let's take a picture. Come on.
Picture time!

973
01:13:12,474 --> 01:13:16,603
Tony. Who do you think
locked you out?

974
01:13:16,645 --> 01:13:19,606
I was the one who filed the
injunction against you.

975
01:13:22,067 --> 01:13:24,736
It was the only way I
could protect you.

976
01:13:27,155 --> 01:13:28,406
No. No.

977
01:13:36,873 --> 01:13:41,169
<i>The 15-mile hike to the outskirts
of Gulmira can only be described</i>

978
01:13:41,253 --> 01:13:45,048
<i>as a descent into hell, into a
modern day Heart of Darkness.</i>

979
01:13:45,131 --> 01:13:48,051
<i>Simple farmers and herders
from peaceful villages</i>

980
01:13:48,134 --> 01:13:49,845
<i>have been driven
from their homes,</i>

981
01:13:49,928 --> 01:13:52,013
<i>displaced from their
lands by warlords</i>

982
01:13:52,097 --> 01:13:54,432
<i>emboldened by a
new-found power.</i>

983
01:13:54,516 --> 01:13:57,519
<i>Villagers have been forced to take
shelter in whatever crude dwellings</i>

984
01:13:57,561 --> 01:14:00,355
<i>they can find in the
ruins of other villages,</i>

985
01:14:00,438 --> 01:14:04,151
<i>or here in the remnants of an
old Soviet smelting plant.</i>

986
01:14:09,156 --> 01:14:12,534
<i>Recent violence has been attributed
to a group of foreign fighters</i>

987
01:14:12,617 --> 01:14:15,537
<i>referred to by locals
as the Ten Rings.</i>

988
01:14:15,579 --> 01:14:18,957
<i>As you can see, these men are
heavily armed and on a mission.</i>

989
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:23,295
<i>A mission that could prove fatal
to anyone who stands in their way.</i>

990
01:14:23,378 --> 01:14:25,922
<i>With no political will or
international pressure,</i>

991
01:14:26,006 --> 01:14:28,466
<i>there's very little hope
for these refugees.</i>

992
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:31,803
<i>Around me, a woman begging
for news on her husband,</i>

993
01:14:31,887 --> 01:14:33,680
<i>who was kidnapped
by insurgents,</i>

994
01:14:33,722 --> 01:14:37,225
<i>either forced to join
their militia...</i>

995
01:14:37,309 --> 01:14:39,936
<i>Desperate refugees clutch
yellowed photographs,</i>

996
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:42,606
<i>holding them up to
anyone who will stop.</i>

997
01:14:42,689 --> 01:14:46,109
<i>A child's simple question, "Where
are my mother and father?"</i>

998
01:14:47,903 --> 01:14:50,363
<i>There's very little hope
for these refugees,</i>

999
01:14:50,405 --> 01:14:53,909
<i>refugees who can only wonder
who, if anyone, will help.</i>

1000
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:29,800
Hurry it up.
Put the women in the trucks.

1001
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:30,919
Stack the weapons here.

1002
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:32,045
Clear all the houses.

1003
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:33,797
That one there.
Faster. Faster.

1004
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:43,573
Grab that dog.

1005
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:47,978
Put him with the others.

1006
01:16:58,823 --> 01:17:00,698
What the hell is this?

1007
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:13,712
Shoot this dog.

1008
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:15,663
You're all incompetent.

1009
01:17:19,001 --> 01:17:20,443
Turn your head.

1010
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:28,165
<i>He's all yours.</i>

1011
01:19:26,831 --> 01:19:28,992
What the hell was that?
Were we cleared to go in there?

1012
01:19:29,017 --> 01:19:31,311
No, they were using human shields.
We never got the green light.

1013
01:19:31,353 --> 01:19:33,522
Put me through to State.
They're going to be all over this.

1014
01:19:33,563 --> 01:19:34,856
Get those monitors up!

1015
01:19:34,898 --> 01:19:36,233
We got a bogey!

1016
01:19:36,316 --> 01:19:38,485
Wasn't Air Force!
We got the CIA on the line?

1017
01:19:38,527 --> 01:19:40,529
I've got Langley on the line.
They want to know if it's us.

1018
01:19:40,570 --> 01:19:42,239
No, it definitely
is not us, sir!

1019
01:19:42,322 --> 01:19:44,032
- It wasn't Navy.
- Wasn't Marines.

1020
01:19:44,074 --> 01:19:46,576
I need answers!
Can I please get eyes on target?

1021
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:48,954
- Negative, negative.
- Cannot identify.

1022
01:19:49,037 --> 01:19:51,437
Get me Colonel Rhodes from Weapons
Development down here now!

1023
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:00,215
We ran an ID check
and cross-referenced

1024
01:20:00,298 --> 01:20:02,050
with all known databases.
We have nothing.

1025
01:20:02,092 --> 01:20:04,302
Any high altitude
surveillance in the region?

1026
01:20:04,353 --> 01:20:06,113
We got an AWAC and a
Global Hawk in the area.

1027
01:20:06,138 --> 01:20:07,848
So this thing just
appeared out of nowhere?

1028
01:20:07,889 --> 01:20:09,266
How come it didn't
show up on the radar?

1029
01:20:09,349 --> 01:20:11,351
Got a minimal radar
cross-section, sir.

1030
01:20:11,393 --> 01:20:13,645
- Is it stealth?
- No, sir, it's tiny.

1031
01:20:13,728 --> 01:20:16,064
We think it's an
unmanned aerial vehicle.

1032
01:20:16,106 --> 01:20:17,732
Colonel, what are we
dealing with here?

1033
01:20:20,026 --> 01:20:23,530
- Let me make a call.
- Sergeant, clear a hole.

1034
01:20:26,992 --> 01:20:28,827
- Hello?
- Tony?

1035
01:20:28,910 --> 01:20:30,829
- <i>Who's this?
- It's Rhodes.</i>

1036
01:20:30,912 --> 01:20:32,956
- <i>Sorry, hello?
- I said it's Rhodes.</i>

1037
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:35,792
- Speak up, please.
- What in the hell is that noise?

1038
01:20:36,001 --> 01:20:37,711
Oh, yeah, I'm driving
with the top down.

1039
01:20:37,752 --> 01:20:39,421
Yeah, well, I need
your help right now.

1040
01:20:39,504 --> 01:20:41,256
<i>It's funny how
that works, huh?</i>

1041
01:20:41,298 --> 01:20:44,384
Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a
weapons depot that was just blown up

1042
01:20:44,426 --> 01:20:46,094
a few clicks from where you
were being held captive.

1043
01:20:46,178 --> 01:20:47,929
<i>Well, that's a hot spot.</i>

1044
01:20:47,971 --> 01:20:50,432
<i>Sounds like someone stepped in
and did your job for you, huh?</i>

1045
01:20:50,474 --> 01:20:51,914
Why do you sound out
of breath, Tony?

1046
01:20:51,933 --> 01:20:53,268
<i>I'm not, I was just
jogging in the canyon.</i>

1047
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:54,769
<i>I thought you were driving.
Right, I was driving</i>

1048
01:20:54,811 --> 01:20:56,605
<i>to the canyon, where
I'm going to jog.</i>

1049
01:20:56,688 --> 01:20:59,065
You sure you don't have any tech
in that area I should know about?

1050
01:20:59,107 --> 01:21:00,609
- <i>Nope!
- Bogey spotted!</i>

1051
01:21:00,692 --> 01:21:01,943
Whiplash,
come in hot.

1052
01:21:02,027 --> 01:21:03,528
Okay, good, 'cause
I'm staring at one

1053
01:21:03,612 --> 01:21:06,781
right now, and it's about to
be blown to kingdom come.

1054
01:21:07,616 --> 01:21:09,117
That's my exit.

1055
01:21:14,122 --> 01:21:17,709
<i>Ballroom, this is Whiplash One.
I've got the bogey in my sights.</i>

1056
01:21:17,792 --> 01:21:19,252
Whiplash One, what is it?

1057
01:21:19,294 --> 01:21:20,629
<i>I've got no idea.</i>

1058
01:21:20,712 --> 01:21:21,755
You have radio contact?

1059
01:21:21,796 --> 01:21:23,089
<i>Non responsive, sir.</i>

1060
01:21:23,131 --> 01:21:24,291
Then you are clear to engage.

1061
01:21:26,259 --> 01:21:27,259
<i>Hit it.</i>

1062
01:21:32,098 --> 01:21:34,810
<i>That bogey just went supersonic.
I got a lock!</i>

1063
01:21:39,105 --> 01:21:41,066
- <i>Inbound missile.
- Flares!</i>

1064
01:21:44,110 --> 01:21:46,446
<i>Wait a second.
Bogey deployed flares!</i>

1065
01:22:01,002 --> 01:22:02,254
Deploy flaps!

1066
01:22:03,505 --> 01:22:04,714
Holy!

1067
01:22:04,798 --> 01:22:06,258
That thing just jumped
off the radar, sir.

1068
01:22:06,341 --> 01:22:08,009
The sat visual has been lost.

1069
01:22:08,093 --> 01:22:09,803
<i>No way that's a UAV.</i>

1070
01:22:09,845 --> 01:22:11,012
What is it?

1071
01:22:11,096 --> 01:22:12,681
I can't see anything.

1072
01:22:12,722 --> 01:22:15,642
<i>Whatever it was, it
just bought the farm.</i>

1073
01:22:15,684 --> 01:22:18,228
<i>I think bogey's
been handled, sir.</i>

1074
01:22:27,654 --> 01:22:29,364
- <i>Hello?
- Hi, Rhodey, it's me.</i>

1075
01:22:29,406 --> 01:22:31,116
- <i>It's who?
- I'm sorry, it is me.</i>

1076
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:32,492
<i>You asked. What you were
asking about is me.</i>

1077
01:22:32,534 --> 01:22:34,035
No, see, this isn't a game.

1078
01:22:34,119 --> 01:22:37,455
You do not send civilian equipment
into my active war zone.

1079
01:22:37,539 --> 01:22:39,457
- You understand that?
- This is not a piece of equipment.

1080
01:22:39,541 --> 01:22:42,377
I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!

1081
01:22:42,419 --> 01:22:45,922
Rhodey, you got
anything for me?

1082
01:22:46,006 --> 01:22:47,632
<i>Mark your
position and return to base.</i>

1083
01:22:47,716 --> 01:22:49,092
<i>Roger that, Ballroom.</i>

1084
01:22:51,553 --> 01:22:52,721
<i>On your belly!</i>

1085
01:22:52,804 --> 01:22:54,848
<i>It looks like a man!</i>

1086
01:22:54,890 --> 01:22:57,392
<i>Shake him off!
Roll! Roll!</i>

1087
01:23:05,692 --> 01:23:06,860
<i>I'm hit! I'm hit!</i>

1088
01:23:06,902 --> 01:23:08,945
It's confirmed.
He has been hit.

1089
01:23:13,366 --> 01:23:15,368
<i>Punch out!
Punch out!</i>

1090
01:23:21,583 --> 01:23:23,502
<i>Whiplash One down.</i>

1091
01:23:23,585 --> 01:23:25,128
Whiplash Two, do
you see a chute?

1092
01:23:25,212 --> 01:23:27,297
<i>Negative!
No chute, no chute!</i>

1093
01:23:32,969 --> 01:23:34,346
<i>My chute's jammed!</i>

1094
01:23:40,393 --> 01:23:42,771
<i>Sir, I've got a
visual on the bogey.</i>

1095
01:23:42,813 --> 01:23:45,213
Whiplash Two, reengage. If you
get a clear shot, you take it.

1096
01:23:47,958 --> 01:23:49,878
Major, we don't even know
what we're shooting at.

1097
01:23:49,903 --> 01:23:52,023
Call off the Raptors.
That thing just took out an F-22

1098
01:23:52,072 --> 01:23:53,448
inside a legal no fly zone!

1099
01:23:53,490 --> 01:23:55,826
Whiplash Two, if you have
a clear shot, take it!

1100
01:23:55,909 --> 01:23:58,110
<i>You've been reengaged.
Execute evasive maneuver.</i>

1101
01:23:58,119 --> 01:23:59,454
Keep going!

1102
01:24:07,379 --> 01:24:09,130
<i>Good chute!
Good chute!</i>

1103
01:24:17,013 --> 01:24:18,765
Tony, you still there?

1104
01:24:18,807 --> 01:24:19,891
<i>Hey, thanks.</i>

1105
01:24:19,975 --> 01:24:23,311
Oh, my God, you crazy
son of a bitch.

1106
01:24:23,353 --> 01:24:24,954
You owe me a plane.
You know that, right?

1107
01:24:26,565 --> 01:24:29,025
Yeah, well,
technically, he hit me.

1108
01:24:29,109 --> 01:24:30,652
<i>Now are you going to come by
and see what I'm working on?</i>

1109
01:24:30,735 --> 01:24:33,697
No, no, no, no, no, no, the
less I know, the better.

1110
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:35,323
Now, what am I supposed
to tell the press?

1111
01:24:35,407 --> 01:24:37,951
<i>Training exercise.
Isn't that the usual BS?</i>

1112
01:24:37,993 --> 01:24:40,495
<i>It's not that simple.</i>

1113
01:24:40,537 --> 01:24:42,372
An unfortunate
training exercise

1114
01:24:42,455 --> 01:24:46,001
involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.

1115
01:24:46,084 --> 01:24:49,504
I am pleased to report that
the pilot was not injured.

1116
01:24:49,546 --> 01:24:53,508
<i>As for the unexpected turn of
events on the ground in Gulmira,</i>

1117
01:24:53,550 --> 01:24:57,095
<i>it is still unclear who
or what intervened,</i>

1118
01:24:57,179 --> 01:25:00,891
<i>but I can assure you that the United
States government was not involved.</i>

1119
01:25:03,393 --> 01:25:04,478
Hey!

1120
01:25:06,354 --> 01:25:09,191
<i>It is a
tight fit, sir.</i>

1121
01:25:09,232 --> 01:25:12,152
<i>Sir, the more you struggle, the
more this is going to hurt.</i>

1122
01:25:12,194 --> 01:25:14,988
Be gentle.
This is my first time.

1123
01:25:15,030 --> 01:25:16,490
I designed this to
come off, so...

1124
01:25:16,531 --> 01:25:17,532
Hey.

1125
01:25:19,117 --> 01:25:21,411
I really should be able to...

1126
01:25:21,495 --> 01:25:23,038
<i>Please, try
not to move, sir.</i>

1127
01:25:24,414 --> 01:25:26,666
What's going on here?

1128
01:25:31,254 --> 01:25:35,801
Let's face it. This is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.

1129
01:25:35,884 --> 01:25:37,302
Are those bullet holes?

1130
01:26:05,247 --> 01:26:06,248
Welcome.

1131
01:26:09,709 --> 01:26:12,796
Compliments of Tony Stark.

1132
01:26:12,879 --> 01:26:16,550
If you'd killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.

1133
01:26:16,591 --> 01:26:18,510
You paid us trinkets
to kill a prince.

1134
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:20,303
Show me the weapon.

1135
01:26:21,763 --> 01:26:24,808
Come. Leave your
guards outside.

1136
01:26:42,033 --> 01:26:44,161
His escape bore
unexpected fruit.

1137
01:26:47,205 --> 01:26:49,457
So this is how he did it.

1138
01:26:49,499 --> 01:26:52,127
This is only a
first, crude effort.

1139
01:26:52,210 --> 01:26:54,880
Stark has perfected
his design.

1140
01:26:54,963 --> 01:26:58,049
He has made a
masterpiece of death.

1141
01:26:58,133 --> 01:27:00,886
A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.

1142
01:27:02,971 --> 01:27:05,265
And you dream of
Stark's throne.

1143
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:09,227
We have a common enemy.

1144
01:27:13,648 --> 01:27:15,609
If we are still in business,

1145
01:27:18,111 --> 01:27:20,322
I will give you these designs

1146
01:27:21,823 --> 01:27:22,823
as a gift.

1147
01:27:24,493 --> 01:27:25,869
And in turn,

1148
01:27:27,537 --> 01:27:32,375
I hope you'll repay me with
a gift of iron soldiers.

1149
01:27:43,634 --> 01:27:46,594
This is the only gift you shall receive.

1150
01:27:49,559 --> 01:27:50,936
Technology.

1151
01:27:52,813 --> 01:27:57,484
It's always been your Achilles'
heel in this part of the world.

1152
01:27:57,526 --> 01:28:00,612
Don't worry. It'll only
last for 15 minutes.

1153
01:28:01,905 --> 01:28:04,366
That's the least
of your problems.

1154
01:28:09,663 --> 01:28:12,290
Crate up the armor
and the rest of it.

1155
01:28:13,917 --> 01:28:15,794
All right, let's
finish up here.

1156
01:28:19,881 --> 01:28:22,884
Set up Sector 16 underneath
the arc reactor,

1157
01:28:22,926 --> 01:28:24,678
and I'm going to want
this data masked.

1158
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:26,429
Recruit our top engineers.

1159
01:28:26,513 --> 01:28:28,014
I want a prototype right away.

1160
01:28:36,565 --> 01:28:39,734
Hey. You busy?
You mind if I send you on an errand?

1161
01:28:39,818 --> 01:28:42,487
I need you to go to my office.

1162
01:28:42,571 --> 01:28:44,990
You're going to hack into the mainframe
and you're going to retrieve all

1163
01:28:45,073 --> 01:28:47,701
the recent shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip.

1164
01:28:47,742 --> 01:28:49,369
This'll get you in.

1165
01:28:49,411 --> 01:28:51,037
It's probably under
Executive Files.

1166
01:28:51,079 --> 01:28:53,498
If not, they put it on a ghost
drive, in which case you need

1167
01:28:53,582 --> 01:28:56,459
to look for the lowest
numeric heading.

1168
01:28:56,543 --> 01:28:59,004
And what do you plan to do with this
information if I bring it back here?

1169
01:28:59,087 --> 01:29:00,672
Same drill.

1170
01:29:00,755 --> 01:29:02,257
They've been dealing under the
table, and I'm going to stop them.

1171
01:29:02,299 --> 01:29:05,051
I'm going to find my
weapons and destroy them.

1172
01:29:06,428 --> 01:29:07,428
Tony,

1173
01:29:09,764 --> 01:29:11,683
you know that I would
help you with anything,

1174
01:29:11,766 --> 01:29:15,770
but I cannot help you if you're
going to start all of this again.

1175
01:29:15,812 --> 01:29:19,608
There is nothing except this.
There's no art opening.

1176
01:29:19,691 --> 01:29:23,945
There is no benefit.
There is nothing to sign.

1177
01:29:24,029 --> 01:29:26,907
There is the next mission
and nothing else.

1178
01:29:28,283 --> 01:29:29,283
Is that so?

1179
01:29:31,786 --> 01:29:33,205
Well, then, I quit.

1180
01:29:36,374 --> 01:29:38,001
You stood by my side
all these years

1181
01:29:38,084 --> 01:29:41,129
while I reaped the
benefits of destruction.

1182
01:29:41,213 --> 01:29:43,089
And now that I'm trying
to protect the people

1183
01:29:43,131 --> 01:29:44,966
that I put in harm's way,
you're going to walk out?

1184
01:29:45,050 --> 01:29:47,594
You're going to kill
yourself, Tony.

1185
01:29:47,636 --> 01:29:49,513
I'm not going to
be a part of it.

1186
01:29:49,596 --> 01:29:51,598
I shouldn't be alive,

1187
01:29:52,891 --> 01:29:54,476
unless it was for a reason.

1188
01:29:55,852 --> 01:29:58,146
I'm not crazy, Pepper.

1189
01:29:58,230 --> 01:30:01,233
I just finally know
what I have to do.

1190
01:30:05,695 --> 01:30:08,198
And I know in my heart
that it's right.

1191
01:30:24,214 --> 01:30:26,424
You're all I have,
too, you know.

1192
01:31:36,244 --> 01:31:40,749
Sector 16?
What are you up to, Obadiah?

1193
01:31:53,929 --> 01:31:58,266
<i>You did not tell us that the target you
paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark.</i>

1194
01:31:58,308 --> 01:31:59,893
- <i>As you can see, Obadiah Stane...
- Oh, my God.</i>

1195
01:31:59,935 --> 01:32:02,771
<i>Your deception and lies
will cost you dearly.</i>

1196
01:32:02,813 --> 01:32:05,524
<i>The price to kill Tony
Stark has just gone up.</i>

1197
01:32:09,528 --> 01:32:13,657
So, what are we going
to do about this?

1198
01:32:16,451 --> 01:32:17,451
Hmm?

1199
01:32:25,877 --> 01:32:29,131
I know what you're
going through, Pepper.

1200
01:32:36,888 --> 01:32:40,350
Tony. He always gets the
good stuff, doesn't he?

1201
01:33:02,164 --> 01:33:06,668
I was so happy
when he came home.

1202
01:33:06,710 --> 01:33:09,504
It was like we got him
back from the dead.

1203
01:33:12,549 --> 01:33:14,509
Now I realize,

1204
01:33:16,845 --> 01:33:19,723
well, Tony never really
did come home, did he?

1205
01:33:21,850 --> 01:33:24,478
He left a part of
himself in that cave.

1206
01:33:27,272 --> 01:33:28,815
Breaks my heart.

1207
01:33:31,193 --> 01:33:34,821
Well, he's a
complicated person.

1208
01:33:37,866 --> 01:33:41,244
He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be all right.

1209
01:33:47,542 --> 01:33:50,045
You are a very rare woman.

1210
01:33:52,839 --> 01:33:54,883
Tony doesn't know
how lucky he is.

1211
01:33:57,719 --> 01:33:59,262
Thank you. Thanks.

1212
01:34:01,723 --> 01:34:03,517
I'd better get back there.

1213
01:34:09,272 --> 01:34:10,941
Is that today's paper?

1214
01:34:12,943 --> 01:34:13,944
Yes.

1215
01:34:14,486 --> 01:34:16,738
Do you mind?

1216
01:34:16,780 --> 01:34:18,615
- Not at all.
- Puzzle.

1217
01:34:18,698 --> 01:34:19,950
Of course.

1218
01:34:23,495 --> 01:34:24,495
Take care.

1219
01:34:48,937 --> 01:34:50,730
Ms. Potts?
We had an appointment.

1220
01:34:50,772 --> 01:34:51,857
Did you forget about
our appointment?

1221
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:53,441
Nope, right now. Come with me.

1222
01:34:53,525 --> 01:34:54,651
- 3Right now?
- We're going to have it right now.

1223
01:34:54,734 --> 01:34:57,612
- Yeah, walk with me.
- Okay.

1224
01:34:57,696 --> 01:35:00,056
I'm going to give you the meeting
of your life. Your office.

1225
01:35:01,449 --> 01:35:04,619
Yeah, we've been working
our best to do it.

1226
01:35:04,661 --> 01:35:08,331
Absolutely, we're... I'm going
to have to call you back.

1227
01:35:08,415 --> 01:35:11,126
Mr. Stane?
Sir, we've explored

1228
01:35:11,168 --> 01:35:13,462
what you've asked us, and it seems
as though there's a little hiccup.

1229
01:35:13,503 --> 01:35:15,213
- Actually...
- A hiccup?

1230
01:35:15,297 --> 01:35:19,259
Yes, to power the suit, sir, the
technology actually doesn't exist.

1231
01:35:19,301 --> 01:35:22,471
- So it's...
- Wait, wait, wait. The technology?

1232
01:35:22,554 --> 01:35:26,266
William, here is
the technology.

1233
01:35:26,308 --> 01:35:28,560
I've asked you to
simply make it smaller.

1234
01:35:28,643 --> 01:35:32,647
Okay, sir, and that's what we're trying
to do, but honestly, it's impossible.

1235
01:35:32,689 --> 01:35:39,196
Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave!
With a box of scraps!

1236
01:35:41,490 --> 01:35:44,201
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm not Tony Stark.

1237
01:36:00,675 --> 01:36:02,761
<i>Tony?</i>

1238
01:36:04,471 --> 01:36:07,474
<i>Tony, are you there?
Hello?</i>

1239
01:36:09,309 --> 01:36:10,352
Breathe.

1240
01:36:11,686 --> 01:36:14,356
Easy, easy.

1241
01:36:16,525 --> 01:36:18,819
You remember this one, right?

1242
01:36:20,529 --> 01:36:22,864
It's a shame the government
didn't approve it.

1243
01:36:22,906 --> 01:36:26,868
There's so many applications for
causing short-term paralysis.

1244
01:36:29,037 --> 01:36:30,288
Ah, Tony.

1245
01:36:32,958 --> 01:36:37,087
When I ordered the hit on you,

1246
01:36:39,923 --> 01:36:42,425
I worried that I was

1247
01:36:45,428 --> 01:36:47,430
killing the golden goose.

1248
01:36:48,807 --> 01:36:52,561
But, you see, it was just

1249
01:36:53,895 --> 01:36:55,939
fate that you survived that.

1250
01:37:01,236 --> 01:37:04,865
You had one last
golden egg to give.

1251
01:37:09,369 --> 01:37:14,249
Do you really think that just because
you have an idea, it belongs to you?

1252
01:37:18,545 --> 01:37:23,675
Your father, he helped
give us the atomic bomb.

1253
01:37:23,758 --> 01:37:27,637
Now, what kind of world would it be
today if he was as selfish as you?

1254
01:37:37,981 --> 01:37:39,316
Oh, it's beautiful.

1255
01:37:42,277 --> 01:37:46,823
Oh, Tony, this is
your Ninth Symphony.

1256
01:37:48,867 --> 01:37:51,286
Ah. What a masterpiece.
Look at that.

1257
01:37:53,205 --> 01:37:54,789
This is your legacy.

1258
01:37:57,501 --> 01:38:02,380
A new generation of weapons
with this at its heart.

1259
01:38:05,967 --> 01:38:09,721
Weapons that will help steer
the world back on course,

1260
01:38:09,805 --> 01:38:11,723
put the balance of
power in our hands.

1261
01:38:13,642 --> 01:38:15,101
The right hands.

1262
01:38:18,396 --> 01:38:22,651
I wish you could've
seen my prototype.

1263
01:38:24,319 --> 01:38:25,612
It's not as...

1264
01:38:27,155 --> 01:38:29,950
Well, not as
conservative as yours.

1265
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:35,372
Too bad you had to
involve Pepper in this.

1266
01:38:35,455 --> 01:38:37,749
I would have preferred
that she lived.

1267
01:38:51,054 --> 01:38:53,348
What do you mean, he paid
to have Tony killed?

1268
01:38:53,431 --> 01:38:56,017
Pepper, slow down.
Why would Obadiah...

1269
01:38:57,269 --> 01:38:58,562
Okay, where's Tony now?

1270
01:38:58,645 --> 01:39:00,355
I don't know. He's not
answering his phone.

1271
01:39:00,438 --> 01:39:02,691
Please go over there and
make sure everything's okay.

1272
01:39:02,732 --> 01:39:05,360
Thank you, Rhodey.
I know a shortcut.

1273
01:40:11,593 --> 01:40:12,593
Good boy.

1274
01:40:52,676 --> 01:40:53,676
Tony?

1275
01:40:56,429 --> 01:40:57,429
Tony?

1276
01:40:59,307 --> 01:41:00,307
Tony?

1277
01:41:02,602 --> 01:41:03,602
Tony?

1278
01:41:06,398 --> 01:41:07,398
Tony!

1279
01:41:09,651 --> 01:41:12,237
Tony! You okay?

1280
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:13,989
Where's Pepper?

1281
01:41:14,072 --> 01:41:15,949
She's fine.
She's with five agents.

1282
01:41:15,991 --> 01:41:18,410
They're about to
arrest Obadiah.

1283
01:41:18,493 --> 01:41:20,495
That's not going to be enough.

1284
01:41:44,352 --> 01:41:49,900
Section 16. Section 16.
There it is.

1285
01:41:59,367 --> 01:42:02,078
My key's not working.
It's not opening the door.

1286
01:42:02,162 --> 01:42:04,372
Oh, wow! What's that?
It's, like, a little device?

1287
01:42:04,456 --> 01:42:05,874
It's, like, a thing that's
going to pick the lock?

1288
01:42:05,957 --> 01:42:08,293
You might want to take
a few steps back.

1289
01:42:27,229 --> 01:42:29,773
That's the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

1290
01:42:29,856 --> 01:42:32,234
Not bad, huh?
Let's do it.

1291
01:42:39,324 --> 01:42:42,244
You need me to do
anything else?

1292
01:42:42,285 --> 01:42:43,829
<i>Keep the skies clear.</i>

1293
01:42:49,167 --> 01:42:50,252
Damn!

1294
01:42:58,552 --> 01:42:59,636
Next time, baby.

1295
01:43:30,333 --> 01:43:34,254
Looks like you were right.
He was building a suit.

1296
01:43:34,296 --> 01:43:36,214
I thought it'd be bigger.

1297
01:44:32,641 --> 01:44:35,081
How do you think the Mark One
chest piece is going to hold up?

1298
01:44:35,106 --> 01:44:37,442
<i>The suit's at 48%
power and falling, sir.</i>

1299
01:44:37,526 --> 01:44:40,195
<i>That chest piece was never
designed for sustained flight.</i>

1300
01:44:40,278 --> 01:44:41,530
Keep me posted.

1301
01:44:43,573 --> 01:44:44,574
<i>Pepper!</i>

1302
01:44:44,658 --> 01:44:46,159
Tony! Tony, are you okay?

1303
01:44:46,201 --> 01:44:47,702
<i>I'm fine. How are...</i>

1304
01:44:47,744 --> 01:44:49,704
- <i>Obadiah, he's gone insane!
- I know.</i>

1305
01:44:49,746 --> 01:44:51,540
- <i>Listen, you'd better get out of there.
- He built a suit.</i>

1306
01:44:51,623 --> 01:44:53,103
<i>Get out
of there right now!</i>

1307
01:45:04,970 --> 01:45:07,097
<i>Where do you think
you're going?</i>

1308
01:45:12,936 --> 01:45:15,939
<i>Your services are
no longer required.</i>

1309
01:45:16,022 --> 01:45:17,107
<i>Stane!</i>

1310
01:45:42,632 --> 01:45:44,342
<i>I love this suit!</i>

1311
01:45:44,426 --> 01:45:45,469
<i>Put them down!</i>

1312
01:45:45,552 --> 01:45:47,345
<i>Collateral damage, Tony.</i>

1313
01:45:49,181 --> 01:45:50,807
Divert power to chest RT.

1314
01:45:59,941 --> 01:46:01,818
<i>Power reduced to 19%.</i>

1315
01:46:09,951 --> 01:46:10,951
<i>Lady!</i>

1316
01:46:12,954 --> 01:46:14,915
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no!</i>

1317
01:46:37,062 --> 01:46:39,898
<i>For 30 years, I've
been holding you up!</i>

1318
01:46:44,486 --> 01:46:46,571
<i>I built this company
from nothing!</i>

1319
01:46:49,157 --> 01:46:51,493
<i>Nothing is going to
stand in my way.</i>

1320
01:46:57,999 --> 01:46:59,543
<i>Least of all you!</i>

1321
01:47:10,011 --> 01:47:13,807
<i>Impressive!
You've upgraded your armor!</i>

1322
01:47:13,849 --> 01:47:16,268
<i>I've made some
upgrades of my own!</i>

1323
01:47:24,901 --> 01:47:26,862
<i>Sir, it appears
that his suit can fly.</i>

1324
01:47:26,945 --> 01:47:28,655
Duly noted. Take me
to maximum altitude.

1325
01:47:28,697 --> 01:47:31,032
<i>With only 15% power,
the odds of reaching that...</i>

1326
01:47:31,074 --> 01:47:32,993
I know the math!
Do it!

1327
01:47:41,543 --> 01:47:43,879
Sir, you're not going to believe
this. That thing is back.

1328
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:46,423
Get me Major Allen.
Scramble the jets!

1329
01:47:49,259 --> 01:47:52,220
Not necessary, people.
Just a training exercise.

1330
01:47:52,304 --> 01:47:53,430
Yes, sir.

1331
01:48:01,521 --> 01:48:03,482
- <i>Thirteen percent power, sir.
- Climb!</i>

1332
01:48:07,527 --> 01:48:09,237
- <i>Eleven percent.
- Keep going!</i>

1333
01:48:16,286 --> 01:48:18,413
- <i>Seven percent power.
- Just leave it on the screen!</i>

1334
01:48:18,497 --> 01:48:20,040
Stop telling me!

1335
01:48:29,758 --> 01:48:34,846
<i>You had a great idea, Tony, but my
suit is more advanced in every way!</i>

1336
01:48:34,930 --> 01:48:36,973
<i>How'd you solve the
icing problem?</i>

1337
01:48:37,057 --> 01:48:38,558
<i>Icing problem?</i>

1338
01:48:40,769 --> 01:48:42,896
<i>Might want to look into it.</i>

1339
01:48:54,783 --> 01:48:55,783
<i>Two percent.</i>

1340
01:48:58,203 --> 01:49:00,705
<i>We are now running on
emergency backup power.</i>

1341
01:49:00,789 --> 01:49:01,789
Whoa!

1342
01:49:12,801 --> 01:49:16,263
- Potts!
- Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?

1343
01:49:16,304 --> 01:49:20,475
I'm almost out of power. I've got to get
out of this thing. I'll be right there.

1344
01:49:20,559 --> 01:49:21,643
<i>Nice try!</i>

1345
01:49:34,239 --> 01:49:36,324
Weapons status?

1346
01:49:36,408 --> 01:49:38,451
<i>Repulsors offline.
Missiles offline.</i>

1347
01:49:42,873 --> 01:49:44,458
Flares!

1348
01:49:52,966 --> 01:49:54,885
<i>Very clever, Tony.</i>

1349
01:50:00,348 --> 01:50:02,851
- Potts?
- Tony!

1350
01:50:02,893 --> 01:50:04,269
This isn't working.

1351
01:50:04,352 --> 01:50:06,229
We're going to have to overload
the reactor and blast the roof.

1352
01:50:06,313 --> 01:50:07,731
Well, how are you
going to do that?

1353
01:50:07,814 --> 01:50:09,191
You're going to do it.

1354
01:50:09,274 --> 01:50:11,735
Go to the central console,
open up all the circuits.

1355
01:50:11,818 --> 01:50:13,236
When I get clear of the
roof, I'll let you know.

1356
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:15,906
You're going to hit the
master bypass button.

1357
01:50:15,989 --> 01:50:17,429
It's going to fry
everything up here.

1358
01:50:19,534 --> 01:50:21,870
Okay. I'm going in now.

1359
01:50:21,912 --> 01:50:24,790
Make sure you wait till I clear
the roof. I'll buy you some time.

1360
01:50:34,716 --> 01:50:36,426
<i>This looks important!</i>

1361
01:50:57,364 --> 01:51:00,158
I never had a taste for
this sort of thing,

1362
01:51:00,242 --> 01:51:03,995
but I must admit, I'm
deeply enjoying the suit!

1363
01:51:12,629 --> 01:51:14,965
You finally outdid
yourself, Tony!

1364
01:51:17,509 --> 01:51:19,469
You'd have made
your father proud!

1365
01:51:24,599 --> 01:51:26,768
It's ready, Tony!
Get off the roof!

1366
01:51:46,621 --> 01:51:47,789
Tony!

1367
01:51:49,124 --> 01:51:50,459
How ironic, Tony!

1368
01:51:52,586 --> 01:51:55,297
Trying to rid the
world of weapons,

1369
01:51:55,380 --> 01:51:57,632
you gave it its best one ever!

1370
01:51:57,716 --> 01:52:03,263
- Pepper!
- And now I'm going to kill you with it!

1371
01:52:06,725 --> 01:52:09,019
You ripped out my
targeting system!

1372
01:52:09,102 --> 01:52:10,270
Time to hit the button!

1373
01:52:10,312 --> 01:52:12,647
You told me not to!

1374
01:52:12,731 --> 01:52:14,566
Hold still, you little prick!

1375
01:52:16,586 --> 01:52:17,586
Just do it!

1376
01:52:17,611 --> 01:52:19,237
You'll die!

1377
01:52:22,324 --> 01:52:23,825
Push it!

1378
01:53:21,424 --> 01:53:22,884
Tony!

1379
01:53:31,467 --> 01:53:33,787
<i>You've all received the official
statement of what occurred</i>

1380
01:53:33,812 --> 01:53:36,398
<i>at Stark Industries
last night.</i>

1381
01:53:36,439 --> 01:53:41,027
<i>There have been unconfirmed reports
that a robotic prototype malfunctioned</i>

1382
01:53:41,069 --> 01:53:44,364
<i>and caused damage
to the arc reactor.</i>

1383
01:53:44,406 --> 01:53:46,700
<i>Fortunately, a member of Tony
Stark's personal security staff...</i>

1384
01:53:46,741 --> 01:53:48,702
"Iron Man." That's kind of catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.

1385
01:53:48,743 --> 01:53:50,245
I mean, it's not
technically accurate.

1386
01:53:50,328 --> 01:53:52,414
The suit's a
gold-titanium alloy,

1387
01:53:52,497 --> 01:53:55,167
but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.

1388
01:53:55,250 --> 01:53:56,460
Here's your alibi.

1389
01:53:57,711 --> 01:53:58,795
Okay.

1390
01:53:58,879 --> 01:54:01,047
- You were on your yacht.
- Yeah.

1391
01:54:01,089 --> 01:54:03,300
We have port papers that put
you in Avalon all night,

1392
01:54:03,383 --> 01:54:05,103
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.

1393
01:54:05,177 --> 01:54:08,305
See, I was thinking maybe we should
say it was just Pepper and me

1394
01:54:08,388 --> 01:54:10,056
alone on the island.

1395
01:54:11,426 --> 01:54:12,826
- That's what happened.
- All right.

1396
01:54:12,851 --> 01:54:14,561
Just read it, word for word.

1397
01:54:16,897 --> 01:54:18,940
There's nothing
about Stane here.

1398
01:54:18,982 --> 01:54:22,611
That's being handled.
He's on vacation.

1399
01:54:22,652 --> 01:54:25,113
Small aircraft have such
a poor safety record.

1400
01:54:25,197 --> 01:54:27,741
But what about the whole cover
story that it's a bodyguard?

1401
01:54:27,782 --> 01:54:30,660
He's my... I mean, is that...
That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?

1402
01:54:30,744 --> 01:54:33,079
This isn't my first rodeo, Mr.
Stark.

1403
01:54:33,121 --> 01:54:34,456
Just stick to the
official statement,

1404
01:54:34,539 --> 01:54:37,125
and soon, this will
all be behind you.

1405
01:54:37,209 --> 01:54:39,461
You've got 90 seconds.

1406
01:54:41,963 --> 01:54:44,633
Oh, Agent Coulson?

1407
01:54:44,674 --> 01:54:49,179
I just wanted to say thank you
very much for all of your help.

1408
01:54:49,262 --> 01:54:52,390
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.

1409
01:54:52,474 --> 01:54:53,809
From the Strategic Homeland...

1410
01:54:53,892 --> 01:54:56,102
Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

1411
01:54:56,144 --> 01:54:58,230
Right.

1412
01:54:58,313 --> 01:54:59,815
Let's get this
show on the road.

1413
01:54:59,898 --> 01:55:02,275
You know, it's
actually not that bad.

1414
01:55:02,317 --> 01:55:04,653
Even I don't think
I'm Iron Man.

1415
01:55:04,694 --> 01:55:06,279
- You're not Iron Man.
- Am so.

1416
01:55:06,321 --> 01:55:08,824
- You're not.
- All right, suit yourself.

1417
01:55:08,865 --> 01:55:12,869
You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have
this girlfriend who knew my true identity.

1418
01:55:12,953 --> 01:55:14,412
She'd be a wreck, 'cause
she'd always be worrying

1419
01:55:14,496 --> 01:55:15,497
that I was going to die,

1420
01:55:15,580 --> 01:55:17,999
yet so proud of the
man I'd become.

1421
01:55:18,041 --> 01:55:21,419
She'd be wildly conflicted,
which would only make her more

1422
01:55:23,505 --> 01:55:24,589
crazy about me.

1423
01:55:24,673 --> 01:55:26,341
Tell me you never think
about that night.

1424
01:55:26,383 --> 01:55:28,218
- What night?
- You know.

1425
01:55:31,179 --> 01:55:36,726
Are you talking about the night that
we danced and went up on the roof,

1426
01:55:38,562 --> 01:55:44,192
and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,

1427
01:55:44,234 --> 01:55:47,195
and you left me
there, by myself?

1428
01:55:48,697 --> 01:55:51,283
Is that the night
you're talking about?

1429
01:55:51,366 --> 01:55:52,366
Mmm-hmm.

1430
01:55:53,410 --> 01:55:54,410
Thought so.

1431
01:55:57,205 --> 01:56:01,001
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.

1432
01:56:01,042 --> 01:56:04,671
<i>And now, Mr. Stark has
prepared a statement.</i>

1433
01:56:04,713 --> 01:56:07,257
<i>He will not be taking any
questions. Thank you.</i>

1434
01:56:11,928 --> 01:56:14,306
<i>Been a while since I
was in front of you.</i>

1435
01:56:14,389 --> 01:56:16,069
<i>I figure I'll stick to
the cards this time.</i>

1436
01:56:19,282 --> 01:56:22,122
<i>There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred</i>

1437
01:56:22,147 --> 01:56:23,815
<i>on the freeway and
the rooftop...</i>

1438
01:56:23,899 --> 01:56:26,318
I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that

1439
01:56:26,401 --> 01:56:30,155
that was a bodyguard in a suit
that conveniently appeared,

1440
01:56:30,238 --> 01:56:33,366
<i>despite the fact that you...
I know that it's confusing.</i>

1441
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:37,078
<i>It is one thing to question the official
story, and another thing entirely</i>

1442
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:40,415
<i>to make wild accusations, or
insinuate that I'm a superhero.</i>

1443
01:56:40,457 --> 01:56:42,083
I never said you
were a superhero.

1444
01:56:42,167 --> 01:56:43,919
- <i>Didn't?
- Mmm-mmm.</i>

1445
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:47,130
<i>Well, good, because that would
be outlandish and fantastic.</i>

1446
01:56:49,466 --> 01:56:53,220
<i>I'm just not the hero type.
Clearly.</i>

1447
01:56:53,261 --> 01:56:56,348
<i>With this laundry list
of character defects,</i>

1448
01:56:56,431 --> 01:56:57,766
<i>all the mistakes I've made,</i>

1449
01:56:57,849 --> 01:56:59,518
<i>largely public.</i>

1450
01:56:59,601 --> 01:57:01,228
Just stick
to the cards, man.

1451
01:57:01,269 --> 01:57:02,729
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1452
01:57:05,106 --> 01:57:06,608
<i>The truth is.</i>

1453
01:57:12,823 --> 01:57:14,282
<i>I am Iron Man.</i>

1454
02:05:17,516 --> 02:05:18,767
Jarvis!

1455
02:05:18,850 --> 02:05:20,310
<i>Welcome home, sir.</i>

1456
02:05:24,022 --> 02:05:29,778
"I am Iron Man." You think you're
the only superhero in the world?

1457
02:05:29,861 --> 02:05:33,115
Mr. Stark, you've become
part of a bigger universe.

1458
02:05:33,198 --> 02:05:35,450
You just don't know it yet.

1459
02:05:35,492 --> 02:05:37,410
Who the hell are you?

1460
02:05:37,452 --> 02:05:39,996
Nick Fury, Director
of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1461
02:05:41,039 --> 02:05:42,457
Ah.

1462
02:05:42,499 --> 02:05:44,793
I'm here to talk to you about
the Avenger Initiative.

1463
02:05:44,893 --> 02:05:49,893
