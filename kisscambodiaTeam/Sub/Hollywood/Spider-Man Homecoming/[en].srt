1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:38,000
watch on kisskh.me

2
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,200
Things are never
gonna be the same now.

3
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,540
I mean, look at this.

4
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,140
You got aliens.

5
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,310
You got big green guys
tearing down buildings.

6
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,780
When I was a kid, I used
to draw cowboys and Indians.

7
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,280
Actually, it's native American,
but whatever.

8
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,590
Yeah.
Tell you what, though.

9
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,360
It ain't bad, is it?

10
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,620
No. Yeah.

11
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,790
Kid's got a future.

12
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,360
Yeah, well,

13
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,600
we'll see, I guess.

14
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,160
No, hey! Ah!

15
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,760
You can't saw
through that stuff.

16
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,730
These alien bastards are tough.

17
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,200
You gotta use
the stuff they use.

18
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,140
See? All right.
All right.

19
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,140
Oh, hey!

20
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,640
Glad you could join us.
Afternoon.

21
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,110
Yeah. My alarm didn't go off.
Yeah, your alarm.

22
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,480
Look, just go stack that armor
plating like I asked you.

23
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,320
This is a huge deal for us.

24
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,650
Attention, please!

25
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,750
In accordance
with executive order 396b,

26
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,620
all post-battle
cleanup operations

27
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,260
are now under our jurisdiction.

28
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,230
Thank you for your service.
We'll take it from here.

29
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,630
Who the hell are you?

30
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,860
Qualified personnel.

31
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,200
Look, I have a city contract

32
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,170
to salvage all this, okay,
with the city, so...

33
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,500
I apologize, Mr. toomes,
but all salvage operations

34
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,870
are now under our jurisdiction.

35
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,140
Please turn over any
and all exotic materials

36
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,640
that you've collected
or you will be prosecuted.

37
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,180
Ma'am, what am...?

38
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,880
Please. Come here.
Hey, lady, come on.

39
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,650
Look...

40
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,790
I bought trucks for this job.

41
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,290
I brought in a whole new crew.

42
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,720
These guys have a family.
I have a family.

43
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,160
I'm all in on this.
I could lose my house.

44
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,630
I'm sorry, sir.
There's nothing I can do.

45
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,230
Maybe next time,
don't overextend yourself.

46
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,400
What'd you say?

47
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,700
Yeah.

48
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,440
He's right.
I overextended myself.

49
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,780
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Don't do it.

50
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,210
Ah-ah-ah-ah.
Put 'em down.

51
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,250
If you have a grievance,

52
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,250
you may take it up
with my superiors.

53
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,450
Your superiors.
Who the hell are they?

54
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,220
<i>A joint venture
between stark industries</i>

55
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,820
<i>and the federal government,
the department</i>

56
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,860
<i>of damage control,

57
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,360
<i>and storage of alien
and other exotic materials.</i>

58
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,300
Now the assholes who made this
mess are paid to clean it up.

59
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,500
Yeah, it's all rigged.

60
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,700
<i>Experts estimate there are</i>

61
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,800
<i>over 1500 tons
of exotic material</i>

62
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,770
<i>scattered throughout
the tri-state area.</i>

63
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,840
Hey, chief!

64
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,710
We still have another load
from yesterday.

65
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,650
We're supposed
to turn this in, right?

66
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,780
I ain't hauling it.
It's too bad.

67
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:46,550
We could have made some cool
stuff from all that alien junk.

68
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,290
I tell you what.

69
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,990
Let's keep it.

70
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,330
The world's changing.

71
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,300
It's time we change too.

72
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,010
There you go, Mason.

73
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,290
Yeah!

74
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,920
Business is good.

75
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,560
<i>- New York. Queens.
- It's a rough borough,</i>

76
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,800
<i>- but, hey, it's home.
- Who you talking to?</i>

77
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,700
<i>No one. Just making
a little video of the trip.</i>

78
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,440
<i>- You can't show it to anyone.
- Yeah, I know.</i>

79
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,110
<i>Then why are you narrating
in that voice?</i>

80
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,440
<i>Uh, because it's fun.
Fun.</i>

81
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,350
<i>So why do they call you happy?</i>

82
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,820
<i>Come on. I'm not carrying
your bags. Let's go.</i>

83
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,420
<i>Hey, should I go
to the bathroom before?</i>

84
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,850
<i>There's a bathroom on it.</i>

85
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,590
<i>Whoa. No pilot? That's awesome.</i>

86
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,560
<i>Is that where you're gonna sit?
Yeah.</i>

87
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,860
<i>This is your first time
on a private plane?</i>

88
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,560
<i>My first time on any plane.</i>

89
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,070
<i>Should it...? Should it be...?
Should it be making that noise?</i>

90
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,940
<i>Shh, shh, shh.</i>

91
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,680
<i>No one has actually told me</i>

92
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,080
<i>why I'm in Berlin
or what I'm doing.</i>

93
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,680
<i>Something about
captain America going crazy.</i>

94
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,980
<i>- This is you.
- Oh, we're neighbors?</i>

95
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,450
<i>We're not roommates. Suit up.</i>

96
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,790
<i>Okay, Peter, you got this.</i>

97
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,590
<i>What the hell are you wearing?</i>

98
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,860
<i>It's my suit.</i>

99
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,730
<i>Where's the case?
What case?</i>

100
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,460
<i>What? I thought
that was a closet.</i>

101
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,130
<i>- This is still my room?
- Go. Please.</i>

102
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,800
<i>My room is way bigger than...
There.</i>

103
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,400
<i>- I found the case.
- I found the case.</i>

104
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,000
<i>"A minor upgrade"?</i>

105
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,570
<i>Whoa.</i>

106
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,810
<i>Oh, my god.</i>

107
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,140
<i>Put it on.
What the...?</i>

108
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,080
<i>This is the coolest thing
I've ever seen...</i>

109
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,610
<i>Let's go.
But I don't understand.</i>

110
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,450
<i>Is it for me?
Happy. Happy, wait.</i>

111
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,980
<i>This is insane. Insane.</i>

112
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,090
<i>Look at this thing.
Look. Look at the eyes.</i>

113
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,520
<i>The greatest day of my life.
Let's go. Come on.</i>

114
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,890
<i>- Okay, there's captain America,
- iron man, black widow.</i>

115
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,090
<i>- Whoa. Who's that new guy?
- Underoos!</i>

116
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,760
<i>Oh, that's me.
I gotta go. I gotta go.</i>

117
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,470
<i>Hey, everyone.</i>

118
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,170
<i>Okay, so the craziest thing
just happened.</i>

119
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,070
<i>I just had a fight
with captain America.</i>

120
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,940
<i>I stole his shield.
I threw it at him...</i>

121
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,440
<i>What the hell? He's big now.
I gotta go. Hang on.</i>

122
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,550
<i>It was the most amazing thing!</i>

123
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,080
<i>Mr. stark was
like, "hey, underoos!"</i>

124
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,080
<i>I flipped in
and stole cap's shield.</i>

125
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,090
<i>I was like,
"what's up, everybody?"</i>

126
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,190
<i>And then... hey, just a second!</i>

127
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,990
<i>Coming!</i>

128
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,230
<i>Hey.</i>

129
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,930
<i>We have thin walls here.</i>

130
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,960
<i>What are you doing,
a little video diary?</i>

131
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,700
<i>- Yeah.
- It's all right.</i>

132
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,700
<i>- I'd do the same thing.
- I told him not to.</i>

133
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,670
<i>He was filming.
I'm gonna wipe the chip.</i>

134
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,240
<i>Okay. Hey. You know what?</i>

135
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,940
<i>We should make an alibi video</i>

136
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,640
<i>for your aunt anyway.
You ready?</i>

137
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,680
<i>An alibi? Sure. Okay.
We rolling? Get in the frame.</i>

138
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,710
<i>Hey, may. How you doing?</i>

139
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,950
<i>What are you wearing?
Something skimpy, I hope.</i>

140
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,050
<i>Peter, that's inappropriate.</i>

141
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,190
<i>Let's start over.
You can edit it.</i>

142
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,890
<i>Three, two, one. Hey, may.</i>

143
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,660
<i>My gosh, I wanted to tell you</i>

144
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,190
<i>what an incredible job
your nephew did</i>

145
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:24,560
<i>this weekend at
the stark internship retreat.</i>

146
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,100
<i>Everyone was impressed.</i>

147
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,730
<i>- Come on!
- It's a freaking merge. Sorry.</i>

148
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,900
<i>Because you're not
on queens boulevard.</i>

149
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,000
<i>See, happy is hoping</i>

150
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,770
<i>to get bumped up
to asset management.</i>

151
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,240
<i>He was forehead of security,
before that he was a driver.</i>

152
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,940
<i>That was a private conversation.</i>

153
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,980
<i>I don't like joking about this.
It was hard to talk about that.</i>

154
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,720
<i>No, seriously,
was he snoring a bunch?</i>

155
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,050
<i>- Here we are. End of the line.
- Whoops.</i>

156
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,650
<i>Can you give us a moment?
Want me to leave the car?</i>

157
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,160
<i>Grab Peter's case
out of the trunk.</i>

158
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:53,990
I can keep the suit?

159
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,760
Yes, we were
just talking about it.

160
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:58,800
Do me a favor, though.

161
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,270
Happy's kind of
your point guy on this.

162
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,640
Don't stress him out.
Don't do anything stupid.

163
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,070
I've seen his cardiogram.

164
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,810
All right?
Yes.

165
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,940
Don't do anything I would do,

166
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,940
and don't do anything
i wouldn't do.

167
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,950
There's a little gray area
in there. Where you operate.

168
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,810
Wait, does that mean
I'm an avenger?

169
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,180
No.

170
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,780
- This it?
- Seventh floor.

171
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,220
I can take that.
You don't have to.

172
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,020
You'll take it?
Yeah, I can take that.

173
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,020
Thank you.

174
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,090
So when's our next...?

175
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,230
When's our next "retreat,"
you know?

176
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,190
What, next mission?

177
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,700
Yeah, the mission.
The missions.

178
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,000
We'll call you.
Do you have my numbers?

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,100
No, I mean, we'll call you.

180
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,630
Like, someone
will call you. All right?

181
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,700
From your team.
Okay. All right.

182
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,170
That's not a hug.
I'm just grabbing

183
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,910
the door for you.
We're not there yet.

184
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,140
Bye.

185
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,790
They're gonna call me.

186
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,700
What's up, penis Parker?

187
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,710
<i>Rise and shine,
midtown science and technology.</i>

188
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,280
<i>Students, don't forget
about your homecoming tickets.</i>

189
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,210
<i>Do you have a date
for homecoming?</i>

190
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,750
<i>Thanks, Jason,
but I already have a date.</i>

191
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,850
<i>Okay.
Yeah.</i>

192
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,260
Damn it. You,
in my office right now.

193
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,180
Join me, and together

194
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,050
we'll build
my new lego death star.

195
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,450
- What?
- So lame.

196
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,350
No way. That's awesome.
How many pieces?

197
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,690
Three thousand
eight hundred and three.

198
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,390
That's insane.
I know.

199
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,830
You want to build it tonight?

200
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,730
No, I can't tonight.
I've got the stark...

201
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,060
Mm-hm. Stark internship.
Yeah, exactly.

202
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,370
Always got that internship.

203
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,430
Yeah, well, hopefully,

204
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,270
soon it'll lead
to a real job with them.

205
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,770
That would be so sweet.
Right?

206
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,870
He'd be all, "good job
on those spreadsheets, Peter.

207
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,010
Here's a gold coin."

208
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:58,280
I don't know how jobs work.
That's exactly how they work.

209
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,180
I'll knock out the basic bones
of the death star at my place.

210
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,220
I'll come by afterwards.

211
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,480
For the most part, the difficult
thing is the base of it.

212
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,050
The top half we can knock out
in two hours, tops.

213
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,930
That'd be great.

214
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,160
I'm gonna be late!

215
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,830
Okay, so how do we calculate

216
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:20,430
linear acceleration
between points a and b?

217
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,170
Flash.

218
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,070
It's the product
of sine of the angle

219
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,440
and gravity divided by the mass.

220
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,010
Nope. Peter.

221
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,770
You still with us?

222
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,510
Uh, uh, yeah, yeah.

223
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,380
Uh...

224
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,780
Mass cancels out,
so it's just gravity times sine.

225
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,520
Right. See, flash,
being the fastest

226
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,790
isn't always the best
if you are wrong.

227
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,520
You're dead.

228
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:49,130
Today we're talking about
Danish physicist niels bohr,

229
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:52,400
but trust me,
there's nothing bohr-ing

230
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,500
about his discoveries
regarding quantum theory.

231
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,950
- Did Liz get a new top?
- No.

232
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:11,250
We've seen that before,
but never with that skirt.

233
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,120
- Liz, hey. That looks so good.
- Hi!

234
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,360
We should probably stop staring
before it gets creepy.

235
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,430
Too late.
You guys are losers.

236
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,000
Well, then why
do you sit with us?

237
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Because I don't have
any friends.

238
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,470
Let's move to the next question.

239
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,200
What is the heaviest
naturally-occurring element?

240
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,310
Hydrogen's the lightest.

241
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,340
That's not
the question. Okay. Yeah.

242
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,180
Uranium.

243
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,580
That is correct.
Thank you, Abraham.

244
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,250
Yes.
Open your books to page 10.

245
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,150
Peter, it's nationals.

246
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,350
Is there no way
you could take one weekend off?

247
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,150
I can't go to Washington.
If Mr. stark needs me,

248
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,450
I have to make sure I'm here.

249
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,420
You've never been
in the same room as Tony stark.

250
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,890
Wait.
What's happening?

251
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,330
Peter's not going to Washington.

252
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:58,200
No. No, no, no.
Why not?

253
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,830
Really?
Right before nationals?

254
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:03,870
He already quit marching band
and robotics lab.

255
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,610
I'm not obsessed with him.
Just very observant.

256
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,170
Flash, you're in for Peter.

257
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,880
- I don't know.
- I gotta check my calendar first.

258
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,580
I got a hot date
with black widow coming up.

259
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,980
That is false.

260
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:20,120
What'd I tell you about using
the bell for comedic purposes?

261
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,870
Hey, what's up?
Hey, man.

262
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,210
What's up, Mr. delmar?

263
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,640
Hey, Mr. Parker.

264
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,140
Number five, right?

265
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,210
Yeah, and with pickles,

266
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,910
and can you smush it down
real flat? Thanks.

267
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,310
You got it, boss.

268
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,350
How's your aunt?

269
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,050
Yeah, she's all right.

270
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,300
Ten dollars.
It's $5.

271
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,360
For that comment, $10.

272
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:08,130
Hey, come on.
I'm joking. I'm joking.

273
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,970
Here's $5.

274
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,570
What's up, murph?

275
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,310
How you doing, buddy?

276
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,080
So how's school?

277
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,440
Ah, you know. It's boring.
Got better things to do.

278
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,450
Stay in school, kid.
Stay in school.

279
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,380
Otherwise,
you're gonna end up like me.

280
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:28,090
This is great.
Best sandwiches in queens.

281
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,590
Finally.

282
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:43,000
- Excuse me.
- What's the matter with you?

283
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,200
Could you hold this
for a second? Thanks.

284
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,270
Hey, is this anybody's bike? No?

285
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:53,170
- Hey, buddy, is this your bike?
- I have no change.

286
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:56,140
Does anyone have a pen?
Do you have a pen?

287
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,350
Everybody good?

288
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,590
Hey!

289
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:11,790
You're that spider guy
on YouTube, right?

290
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,130
Call me spider-man!

291
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,530
Okay, spider-man. Do a flip.

292
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,630
Yeah!
Not bad.

293
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,050
Hey, buddy.

294
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,520
Shouldn't steal cars, it's bad.
It's my car, dumbass!

295
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,780
Hey! Shut that off!

296
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,820
Can you tell him it's my car?
I was just...

297
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,090
Yo! I work at nights. Come on.
That's not your car!

298
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,690
That's his car.
How was I supposed to know?

299
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,430
He put that in the window!
Every day with these alarms!

300
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:52,130
Turn it off!
Don't make me come down there.

301
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,500
Hey, Gary! How you doing?

302
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,340
Marjorie, how are you?
How's your mother?

303
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,680
I'm good, I'm good.

304
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,180
<i>You have reached
the voicemail box of:</i>

305
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,680
<i>Happy hogan.</i>

306
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,320
- Hey, happy.
- Here's my report for tonight.

307
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,690
I stopped a grand theft bicycle.

308
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,520
Couldn't find the owner,
so I just left a note.

309
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,360
Um...

310
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,720
I helped this lost,
old Dominican lady.

311
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:23,430
She was really nice
and bought me a churro.

312
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,200
I just feel like
i could be doing more.

313
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,230
You know? Just curious
when the next

314
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,730
real mission's gonna be.

315
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,570
So, yeah, just call me back.

316
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,840
It's Peter. Parker.

317
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,780
Why would I tell him
about the churro?

318
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,690
Oh. Unh.
Hey, hey. Oh! Ah.

319
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,530
Okay.

320
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,530
Can't wait to see this thing.

321
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:00,270
Finally, something good.

322
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,740
Yo, this high-tech stuff
makes it too easy.

323
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,810
- Told you it was worth it.
- Okay, go, go, go.

324
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,280
Oh, heh, nice.

325
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,620
We can hit, like,
five more places tonight.

326
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,430
Ahem. What's up, guys?

327
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,530
You forget your pin number?

328
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,660
Whoa! You're the avengers.

329
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,700
What are you guys doing here?

330
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:38,440
Thor. Hulk. Good to
finally meet you guys.

331
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,610
I thought you'd be more handsome
in person. Iron man.

332
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:45,440
Hey, what are you doing robbing
a bank? You're a billionaire.

333
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,280
Hey...

334
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,320
Oh, this feels so weird.

335
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,420
What is that thing?

336
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:59,720
I'm starting... To think...
You're not... The avengers.

337
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,930
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

338
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,500
Uh, spider-man is
fighting the avengers

339
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,670
in a bank on 21st street.

340
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:12,970
- All right, let's wrap this up.
- It's a school night.

341
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,980
So how do jerks like you
get tech like this?

342
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,850
No. Wait, wait, wait!
Ah!

343
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,650
Mr. delmar.

344
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,920
Hey, Mr. delmar, you in here?
Is anybody in here? Hello?

345
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,400
Oh, come on.

346
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,510
I gotta...

347
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,740
Here, here.
Good, yeah.

348
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,380
Okay. Good. Yes.

349
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,710
Yes... no.
No, put that down.

350
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,580
That's worth more
than you or me. Yeah?

351
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,850
Happy, the craziest thing
just happened to me.

352
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,390
These guys were robbing an atm

353
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,960
with high-tech weapons...
Take a breath. I don't have time

354
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,960
for atm robberies <i>yeah, but...</i>

355
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,530
Or the notes you leave behind.

356
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:08,860
I have moving day
to worry about.

357
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,760
<i>Everything's gotta be out
by next week.</i>

358
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,300
Wait, wait. You're moving?
Who's moving?

359
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,930
Yeah, don't you watch the news?

360
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,300
Tony sold avengers tower.

361
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,970
We're relocating
to a new facility upstate

362
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,470
where hopefully the cell
service is much worse.

363
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,840
But what about me?
What about you?

364
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,650
Well, what if Mr. stark needs me
or something big goes down?

365
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,750
<i>Can I just please talk
to Mr. stark?</i>

366
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,280
Stay away
from anything dangerous.

367
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,420
I'm responsible for making sure
you're responsible, okay?

368
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,290
I am responsible.
I... oh, crap.

369
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,920
<i>My backpack's gone.</i>
That doesn't sound responsible.

370
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:44,060
<i>I'll call you back.</i>
Feel free not to.

371
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,760
What was that?

372
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,490
Uh, it's nothing. Nothing.

373
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,960
You're the spider-man.

374
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,530
From YouTube.
I'm not. I'm not.

375
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,030
You were on the ceiling.
What are you doing in my room?

376
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,500
May let me in. We were gonna
finish the death star.

377
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,600
You can't just bust
into my room!

378
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,510
That Turkey meatloaf recipe
is a disaster.

379
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,880
Let's go to dinner.
Thai? Ned, you want thai?

380
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,580
Yes.
No. He's got a thing.

381
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,580
A thing to do after.

382
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,580
Okay.

383
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,750
Maybe put on some clothes.

384
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,690
Oh, she doesn't know?
Nobody knows.

385
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,390
Mr. stark knows because
he made my suit. That's it.

386
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:25,000
Tony stark made you that?
Are you an avenger?

387
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,800
Yeah, basically.

388
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,600
Oh, geez.
You can't tell anybody.

389
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,940
You gotta keep it a secret.

390
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,770
Secret? Why?
You know what she's like.

391
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,470
If she finds out people
try and kill me

392
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,670
every night,
she won't let me do this.

393
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,040
Come on, ned, please.

394
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,910
Okay, okay, okay.

395
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,410
I'll level with you.

396
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,510
I can't keep this a secret.

397
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,150
It's the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

398
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:47,150
Ned, may cannot know. I cannot
do that to her right now.

399
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,920
You know?
I mean, everything

400
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,160
that's happened
with her, i... please.

401
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:56,830
Okay.
Just swear it, okay?

402
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,000
I swear.

403
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,800
Thank you.
Yeah.

404
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,000
I can't believe
this is happening now.

405
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,200
Can I try the suit on?
No.

406
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,470
How's it work? Magnets?
How do you shoot the strings?

407
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:08,010
I'm gonna tell you tomorrow.
Great.

408
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,710
Okay, well, wait, then.

409
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:14,150
How do you do this
and the stark internship?

410
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,080
This is the stark internship.

411
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,180
Ohh...

412
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,950
Just get out of here.

413
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,690
<i>What's the matter?</i>

414
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,890
Thought you loved larb.

415
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:29,030
It's too larby?

416
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,230
Not larby enough.

417
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,930
How many times do I have
to say "larb" before...

418
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,700
You talk to me?

419
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,240
You know I larb you.

420
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,210
I'm just stressed.
The internship, and I'm tired.

421
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,540
A lot of work.

422
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,140
The stark internship.

423
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,910
I have to tell you,
not a fan of that Tony stark.

424
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,520
You're distracted all the time.
He's got you in your head.

425
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,750
<i>Delmar's sandwiches destroyed...</i>

426
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,120
What does he have you doing?

427
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,720
You need to use your instincts.

428
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,890
<i>After an atm robbery
was thwarted</i>

429
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:03,730
<i>by queens' own crime stopper,</i>
what?

430
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:04,700
<i>The spider-man.</i>

431
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,230
<i>As the spider-man attempted
to foil their heist,</i>

432
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,870
<i>a powerful blast was set off,</i>

433
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,100
<i>slicing through
the bodega across the street.</i>

434
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,170
<i>Miraculously, no one was harmed.</i>

435
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,640
If you spot something
like that happening,

436
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,710
you turn and you run
the other way.

437
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:20,010
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Of course.

438
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,550
Six blocks away from us.

439
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:24,180
I need a new backpack.

440
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:27,190
What?
I need a new backpack.

441
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,550
That's five.

442
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,620
Sticky rice pudding.
We didn't order that.

443
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,760
It's on the house.

444
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,600
Oh. Thanks.

445
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,570
That's nice of him.

446
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,770
I think he larbs you.

447
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:46,640
<i>You got bit by a spider?</i>

448
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,670
Can it bite me?

449
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,240
Well, it probably
would've hurt, right?

450
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,240
Whatever. Even if it did hurt,
I'd let it bite me.

451
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,550
Maybe. How much
did it hurt?

452
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,220
The spider's dead, ned.

453
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,890
Whoa.

454
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,190
You were here?

455
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,860
Yeah.

456
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,630
You could've died.

457
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,630
Do you lay eggs?

458
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,970
What? No.

459
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22,910
Can you spit venom?
No.

460
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,940
Can you summon
an army of spiders?

461
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:26,780
No, ned.

462
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,710
The sokovia accords
were put into place...

463
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,180
How far can you shoot your webs?

464
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,150
It's unknown. Shut up.

465
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,190
To begin regulating...

466
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,260
If I was you,
i would stand on a building

467
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,330
and shoot as far as I could...
Shut up, ned.

468
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,360
<i>Hi. I'm captain America.</i>

469
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,330
<i>Whether you're in the classroom
or on the battlefield...</i>

470
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,170
Do you know him too?
Yeah, we met.

471
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,740
I stole his shield.
What?

472
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,700
<i>Today, my good friend,
your gym teacher</i>

473
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:56,140
<i>will be conducting the captain
America fitness challenge.</i>

474
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,180
Thank you, captain.

475
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,210
Pretty sure he's a war criminal,
but I have to show these videos.

476
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,610
It's required by the state.
Let's do it.

477
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,750
Do avengers have to pay taxes?

478
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,880
What does hulk smell like?

479
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,750
- I bet he smells nice.
- You have to shut up.

480
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:11,290
Is captain America cool, or is
he like a mean, old grandpa?

481
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,190
Ned, just shh, okay?

482
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,190
Hey, can I be your guy
in the chair?

483
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,000
What?

484
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,730
Yeah. You know how
there's a guy with a headset

485
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,130
telling the other guy
where to go?

486
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:24,640
If you're in a burning building,
i could tell you where to go.

487
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,270
There'd be screens around me,
and I could swivel around.

488
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,870
I could be your guy
in the chair.

489
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,140
Ned, I don't need
a guy in the chair.

490
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,780
Looking good, Parker.

491
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:38,380
Now, see, for me,
it would be f Thor

492
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,350
marry iron man and kill hulk.

493
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,320
Well, what about
the spider-man?

494
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,790
It's just spider-man.

495
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,990
See the bank security
cam on YouTube?

496
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,030
He fought off four guys.

497
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,830
Oh, my god, she's
crushing on spider-man.

498
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,730
No way.

499
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:53,030
Kind of.
Oh, gross.

500
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,730
He's probably, like, 30.

501
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,170
You don't know
what he looks like.

502
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,370
What if he's seriously burned?

503
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:01,010
I wouldn't care. I'd love him
for the person he is inside.

504
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:03,840
Peter knows spider-man.

505
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:09,180
No, I don't.
No. I... I mean...

506
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,080
They're friends.

507
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,420
Yeah, like coach Wilson
and captain America are friends.

508
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:16,790
I've met him, yeah.
A couple times.

509
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,990
But it's...

510
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:21,390
Through the stark internship.

511
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:24,200
Yeah, well, I'm not really
supposed to talk about it.

512
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,160
Well, that's awesome.
Hey, you know what?

513
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:29,030
Maybe you should invite him
to Liz's party. Right?

514
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,170
Yeah, um, I'm having
people over tonight.

515
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,700
You're more
than welcome to come.

516
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,840
- Having a party?
- Yeah, it's gonna be dope.

517
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,180
You should totally invite
your personal friend spider-man.

518
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,380
Um...
It's okay.

519
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,810
I know Peter's way too busy
for parties anyway, so...

520
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,220
Come on. He'll be there.
Right, Parker?

521
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,190
What are you doing?

522
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,830
Helping you out.

523
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,390
Did you not hear her?

524
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,260
Liz has a crush on you.

525
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,970
Dude, you're an avenger.

526
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:08,210
If any one of us has a chance
with a senior girl, it's you.

527
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,010
House party in the suburbs.

528
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:16,410
Oh, I remember these.
Kind of jealous.

529
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:19,280
It'll be a night to remember.
Oh...

530
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,250
Ned, some hats wear men.
You wear that hat.

531
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,960
Yeah, it gives me confidence.
Hm.

532
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,160
This is a mistake.

533
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,860
Hey, let's just go home.

534
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,860
Oh, Peter.

535
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,800
I know.
I know it's really hard

536
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,900
trying to fit in
with all the changes

537
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,470
your body's going through.

538
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:36,870
It's flowering now.

539
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,540
He's so stressed out lately.

540
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,510
What helps
with stress is a party.

541
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,780
We should go to the party.

542
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,480
Yeah, let's do it.
I'm gonna go.

543
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:49,050
Peter...

544
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:52,080
Have fun, okay? Okay.
I will.

545
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,420
Bye, may.

546
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,020
Dude, you have the suit, right?

547
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,920
Yeah.
This is gonna change our lives.

548
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,930
Annie, over here!

549
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,230
Hey.
Hey.

550
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,570
<i>Dj flash.</i>

551
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:16,340
Okay. We're gonna have
spider-man swing in,

552
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,240
say you guys
are tight, and I get

553
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,180
a fist bump or one
of those half bro-hugs.

554
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:23,080
Can't believe you're
at this lame party.

555
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,820
But you're here too.

556
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,090
Am I?

557
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,590
Oh, my gosh.

558
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,960
Hey, guys.
Cool hat, ned.

559
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,560
Hi, Liz.
Hi, Liz.

560
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,390
I'm so happy you guys came.

561
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,130
There's pizza
and drinks. Help yourself.

562
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,570
What a great party.
Thanks.

563
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,200
Oh, i...

564
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:49,840
My parents will kill me
if anything's broken. I gotta...

565
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,540
Yeah.
Have fun.

566
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,410
- Bye.
- Bye.

567
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,410
Dude, what are you doing?

568
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,320
She's here.
Spider it up.

569
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,250
No, no, no. I can't...
I cannot do this.

570
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,920
Spider-man is not
a party trick, okay?

571
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,020
Look, I'm just gonna be myself.

572
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,930
Peter, no one wants that.

573
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,230
Dude.

574
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:13,500
Penis Parker, what's up?

575
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,000
So where's your pal spider-man?

576
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,970
Let me guess: In Canada
with your imaginary girlfriend?

577
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,210
That's not spider-man.

578
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:25,380
That's just ned in a red shirt.

579
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,950
"Hey, what's up?
I'm spider-man.

580
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:36,220
"Just thought I'd swing by
and say hello to my buddy Peter.

581
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,260
"Oh, what's up, ned?
Hey, where's Peter, anyways?

582
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,960
He must be around..."

583
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:49,430
God, this is stupid.
What am I doing?

584
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,110
What the hell?

585
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,390
Whoo!

586
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:22,270
This sucks.

587
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,200
Whoo!

588
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,410
Now, this is crafted
from a reclaimed

589
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:31,280
sub-ultron arm
straight from sokovia.

590
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,280
Here. You try.

591
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,210
Man, I wanted something low-key.

592
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,650
Why are you trying
to upsell me, man?

593
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:39,180
Okay, okay. I got
what you need, all right?

594
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:42,650
I got tons of
great stuff here. One sec.

595
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:47,290
Okay, I got black hole grenades,
chitauri railguns...

596
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,430
You letting off shots
in public now? Hurry up.

597
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:51,960
Look, times are changing.
We're the only ones

598
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,330
selling these
high-tech weapons.

599
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:57,070
Oh, this must be where
the atm robbers got their stuff.

600
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,640
I need something
to stick up somebody.

601
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,010
I'm not trying to shoot them
back in time.

602
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:04,480
I got antigrav climbers.

603
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,440
Yo, climbers?

604
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,350
Okay, what the hell is that?

605
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:14,290
Did you set us up?
Hey, hey, man.

606
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:20,120
Hey! Come on. You gonna shoot
at somebody, shoot at me.

607
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:22,460
All right.

608
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:36,670
What was that?

609
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:45,120
What...?

610
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:50,350
We gotta call him.
No, no, no, no.

611
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:56,790
Did you just do it again?

612
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,460
Shut up.
I'm calling him.

613
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,270
Toomes's phone.

614
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,240
Boss.

615
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,380
Oh, my butt!

616
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:37,070
Great. Guess I'm gonna have
to take a shortcut.

617
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,840
Hey, guys.
Good game. Have fun.

618
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,470
Hey, hey, buddy.

619
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,810
Sorry, no time to play.
Here, go fetch.

620
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,210
Whoo!

621
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:51,480
Now, this is more like it.

622
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:02,130
Whoa!

623
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:04,560
Smells really good.

624
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,170
Great movie!

625
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,310
Oh, hey, guys.

626
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,380
No! No!

627
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:23,380
<i>- Hey, it's Peter.
- Leave a message.</i>

628
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,480
Peter, where are you?

629
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,380
The hat's not working.
This is not cool.

630
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:30,690
Almost got you.

631
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,770
Thought you got away
from me, didn't you?

632
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,470
I got you
right where I want you.

633
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:50,240
Surprise!

634
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,650
What the hell?

635
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,660
Oh, hey.

636
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:49,730
And then he just, like,
swooped down like a monster

637
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,900
and picked me up, and took me up

638
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,600
like a thousand feet
and just dropped me.

639
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:56,710
How'd you find me? Did you put
a tracker in my suit?

640
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,410
I put everything in your suit.

641
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,250
Including this heater.

642
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,410
Whoa.

643
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,250
That's better. Thanks.
What were you thinking?

644
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,950
The guy with wings is
the source of the weapons.

645
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,390
I gotta take him down.

646
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,620
Take him down now, huh?

647
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,830
Crockett, there are people
who handle this sort of thing.

648
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,360
The avengers?
No, no, no.

649
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,760
This is a little below
their pay grade.

650
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,500
Mr. stark, you didn't have
to come out here.

651
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,800
I had that. I was fine.

652
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,270
<i>Oh, I'm not here.</i>

653
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,910
Thank god
this place has Wi-Fi

654
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,640
or you would be toast right now.

655
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,380
Thank Ganesh while you're at it.

656
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,680
Cheers.

657
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,550
<i>Look, forget the flying
vulture guy, please.</i>

658
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,780
Why?
<i>Why?</i>

659
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,650
Because I said so!

660
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:43,250
Sorry, I'm talking
to a teenager.

661
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,320
<i>Stay close to the ground.</i>

662
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,020
<i>Build up your game helping
the little people,</i>

663
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,630
like that lady that
bought you the churro.

664
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:52,800
Can't you just be a friendly

665
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,930
neighborhood spider-man?

666
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,800
But I'm ready
for more than that now.

667
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,340
<i>No, you're not.</i>
That is not what you thought

668
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,600
when I took on captain America.
<i>Trust me, kid.</i>

669
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,740
<i>If cap wanted to lay you out,
he would've.</i>

670
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,540
<i>Listen to me.
If you come across</i>

671
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,340
<i>these weapons again, call happy.</i>

672
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,280
Are you driving?

673
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,580
You know, it's never too early
to start thinking about college.

674
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:16,020
I got some pull
at mit. End call.

675
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,390
No, I don't need to go to...

676
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:21,430
<i>Mr. stark is
no longer connected.</i>

677
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:25,000
That's awesome.

678
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,800
"Stay close to the ground"?
What is he talking about?

679
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,310
Whoa.

680
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,890
Hey, man, what's up?
I'm on my way back.

681
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,420
Actually, i was calling to say

682
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,890
maybe you shouldn't come.
Listen to this.

683
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:56,760
When I say "penis,"
you say "Parker."

684
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,330
- Penis!
- Parker!

685
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:02,070
<i>- Sorry, Peter.
- I guess we're still losers.</i>

686
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,330
<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

687
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,340
I'll see you tomorrow in school.

688
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,630
Whoa.

689
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,480
Idiots.

690
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,880
Idiots!

691
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,590
Boss? Your wife
keeps texting you.

692
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,920
Something about a brake light.

693
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,090
What'd I tell you about
looking at my phone?

694
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,860
Oh. Sorry.
You left it out.

695
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,890
You know
I'm a curious person by nature.

696
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:07,400
I finished designing
that high-altitude vacuum seal.

697
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,900
Huh?
In case you want to,

698
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,140
you know, go for the big one?

699
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,840
You're still on that?
I told you, no.

700
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,770
The answer's no.
Forget it.

701
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:23,010
Ha, ha, ha! Whoo!

702
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,550
I mean, that was badass.

703
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,860
How many times have I told you

704
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,630
not to fire them
out in the open?

705
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:39,000
You said, move the merchandise.
Under the radar.

706
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,200
Under the radar!

707
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,930
That's how we survive.

708
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,530
If you bring damage control

709
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,740
or the avengers down here,
we're through.

710
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,640
You're out there wearing
that goofy thing,

711
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,740
lighting up cars
calling yourself the shocker.

712
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,680
"I'm the shocker.
I shock people."

713
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,040
What is this, pro wrestling?

714
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:56,980
Whatever, old man.
Come on.

715
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:59,580
Look.

716
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,150
Look.

717
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:03,790
I know you don't give
a crap about anything.

718
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,460
But I do.

719
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,490
I built this whole place

720
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:08,190
because I got people
i have to look after.

721
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:12,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

722
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,470
You know what?

723
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:18,240
I can't afford your bullshit.

724
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,900
Get out of here.
What?

725
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,740
You're done.
You're off the crew.

726
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,070
Yeah, all right.

727
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,040
Heh. All right.

728
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,010
Wonder if you can afford me
out there, though, right?

729
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:30,710
With everything I know.

730
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,720
Excuse me?
I'm just saying,

731
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,220
maybe your wife
would like to know

732
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:38,560
where you really get
your money from.

733
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,590
You know what?
What?

734
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,690
You're right.

735
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:44,700
That work?
I don't know.

736
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,100
I can't afford that.

737
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,630
W-w-wait.

738
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,840
Damn.

739
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,140
I thought this was
the antigravity gun.

740
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:04,720
What?
No, that's that one.

741
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:18,730
Here.

742
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,060
Now you're the shocker.

743
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:23,300
Go out there and find
that weapon he lost.

744
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,170
All right.

745
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:35,110
Hey, thanks for bailing on me.

746
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:37,580
Yeah, well, something came up.

747
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,580
Oh, what is that?

748
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:41,990
I don't know. Some guy tried
to vaporize me with it.

749
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,950
Seriously?
Yeah.

750
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,720
Awesome.

751
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,330
I mean, not awesome.
Totally uncool of that guy.

752
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:51,090
So scary.
Yeah.

753
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,300
Well, look, I think
it's a power source.

754
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,330
Yeah, but it's connected
to all these microprocessors.

755
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,900
That's an inductive
charging plate.

756
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,940
That's what I use
to charge my toothbrush.

757
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,210
Whoever's making these weapons

758
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:03,810
is combining
alien tech with ours.

759
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:08,580
That is literally the coolest
sentence anyone has ever said.

760
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,610
I just want to thank you

761
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,750
for letting me be
part of your journey

762
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,990
into this amazing...

763
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:20,690
Keep your fingers
clear of the blades.

764
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:23,090
I gotta figure out what this is
and who makes it.

765
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,730
We'll go to the lab after class
and run some tests.

766
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,830
Let's do it.

767
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:36,910
First, we put the glowy thing
in the mass spectrometer.

768
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:40,610
We gotta come up with a better
name than "glowy thingy."

769
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:43,250
You're right.

770
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:43,980
Crap.

771
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,050
Come on, come on, come on.

772
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:51,760
High schools creep me out.

773
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,060
They got this funny smell,
you know what I mean?

774
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:58,000
Hey, that's one of the guys
that tried to kill me.

775
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
What?
Yeah.

776
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,230
We gotta get out of here.

777
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:02,070
No, no, no. I gotta follow them.

778
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:04,640
They can lead me to the guy
that dropped me in the lake.

779
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,410
Someone dropped you in a lake?
Yeah, it was not good.

780
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:11,170
Peter...
No. Stay there, ned.

781
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,410
Peter.

782
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,650
What are you doing?

783
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:18,850
Nothing.

784
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:21,150
Yeah. You good?

785
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,950
Chess.

786
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:26,660
Man, can you imagine
what the boss would say

787
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,920
if he knew where we were?

788
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:30,060
It's saying there was
an energy pulse here.

789
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,000
There's no sign of the weapon.

790
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,770
And even if it was here,
now it's gone.

791
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:37,670
So are we.

792
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,900
This is so awesome.

793
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,800
I know, right?

794
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:18,980
They're in Brooklyn.

795
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:24,720
Staten island.

796
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:32,290
Leaving Jersey.

797
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:42,000
They stopped.

798
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,900
Huh.

799
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:44,800
Maryland?

800
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,340
What's there?
I don't know.

801
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,210
Evil lair?

802
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:50,370
They have a lair?
Dude, a gang with alien guns

803
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,340
run by a guy with wings?
Yeah, they have a lair.

804
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:54,140
Badass.

805
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:58,350
But how are you gonna get there
if it's, like, 300 miles away?

806
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:02,750
It's not too far from D.C.

807
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,350
Hey, it's Peter.
Guys.

808
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,460
- Peter?
- Hey, buddy.

809
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,520
Yeah, I was hoping I could
rejoin the team.

810
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:09,390
No, no way.
You can't quit on us,

811
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:12,330
stroll up and be
welcomed back by everyone.

812
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:13,460
Hey, welcome back, Peter!

813
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,370
Flash, you're back
to first alternate.

814
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:16,870
What?
He's taking your place.

815
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:18,170
Excuse me, can we go already?

816
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:20,070
I was hoping to get in
some light protesting

817
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:22,040
in front of one
of the embassies before dinner.

818
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:26,040
Protesting is patriotic.
Let's get on the bus.

819
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:27,810
<i>Focus up, everyone.</i>

820
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:30,180
<i>Our next topic
is the moons of saturn.</i>

821
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,850
Second law of thermodynamics.

822
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:34,450
Frank Sinatra.
Fort sumter.

823
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:36,990
Flash is wrong.
Okay, guys, let's focus.

824
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:38,890
Next one.
Liz, don't overwork 'em.

825
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:41,190
Uh, strontium, barium,
vibranium.

826
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:43,530
Very good, Peter.
Glad to have you back.

827
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:45,860
Glad to be back.

828
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,500
What is the current
standard unit of...?

829
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,830
Can I take this real quick?
I'll only be a sec.

830
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,100
Yeah, fine.
Hello?

831
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,840
Got a blip on my screen here.
You left New York?

832
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,410
Okay, focus up, everyone.
Tracker.

833
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:58,310
Yeah, it's just a school trip.
It's nothing.

834
00:46:58,310 --> 00:46:59,440
Look, happy, I gotta say,

835
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,980
you tracking me
without permission

836
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:03,050
is a complete violation
of my privacy.

837
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:04,580
That's different.
What's different?

838
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:07,550
Nothing. Look, it's just
the academic decathlon.

839
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:08,990
<i>It's no big deal.</i>
Hey, hey.

840
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:11,960
I'll decide if it's no big deal.

841
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,060
Sounds like it's no big deal,

842
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:16,060
but remember, I'm watching you.

843
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:29,510
Everyone stick together.
Yeah.

844
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:31,880
You kidding me?
This place is huge.

845
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,410
I've seen bigger.
There's a bird in here.

846
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:37,410
Hey, you brought
your laptop, right?

847
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:39,150
Why?

848
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:47,290
Peter,

849
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:50,630
why are we removing
the tracker from your suit?

850
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:53,060
Uh, because
i gotta follow these guys

851
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,870
to their boss
before they move again

852
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:58,440
and I don't really want
Mr. stark to know about it.

853
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,870
So you're lying to iron man now?

854
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:01,940
No, I'm not lying.

855
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:05,940
He just doesn't really get
what I can do yet.

856
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:10,650
Oh, gotcha.

857
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:16,450
All right, happy,
enjoy tracking this lamp.

858
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:21,290
There's a ton
of other subsystems in here.

859
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:21,990
Hm?

860
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:26,000
But they're all disabled
by the training wheels protocol.

861
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,530
What?

862
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:29,500
"Training wheels protocol"?

863
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,400
Turn it off.

864
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,300
I don't think
that's a good idea.

865
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,670
They're blocked for a reason.

866
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:35,910
Come on, man,
i don't need training wheels.

867
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:38,510
I'm sick of him treating me
like a kid all the time.

868
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:40,610
It's not cool.
But you are a kid.

869
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:43,110
Yeah, a kid who can stop
a bus with his bare hands.

870
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,320
Peter, I just don't think
this is a great idea.

871
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,680
I mean, what if this is illegal?

872
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:48,620
Look, please.

873
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,450
This is my chance
to prove myself.

874
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,160
I can handle it.
Ned, come on.

875
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,360
I really don't think
this is a good idea.

876
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,490
The guy in the chair.

877
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:58,530
Don't do that.
Come on.

878
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:15,050
The glowy thing, it's evidence.
Keep it safe, all right?

879
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:17,210
Okay. Okay.

880
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,980
They're moving.
Be careful.

881
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:24,720
Hey, Liz.
Perfect timing.

882
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,190
We're gonna go swimming.

883
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:28,090
Come on, come on.
What?

884
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:31,430
Hey, Peter.
Hi.

885
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,230
Hey.

886
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:37,630
I was... I was gonna go study
in the business center.

887
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,100
Peter, you don't need to study.

888
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,140
You're, like, the smartest guy
I've ever met.

889
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,470
And besides,
a rebellious group activity

890
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,510
the day before competition
is good for morale.

891
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:47,280
Hm?

892
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,450
Well, I read that
in a Ted talk, so...

893
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:52,120
I... I heard it
in a Ted talk.

894
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,550
And I read a coaching book.

895
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:57,520
Are you really...
This is really important to you.

896
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,490
Yeah. It's our future.

897
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:01,590
I'm not gonna screw it up.

898
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:03,290
Besides, we raided the minibar

899
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,430
and these candy bars were,
like, $11.

900
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:08,600
So get your trunks on
and come on.

901
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:09,430
Come on.

902
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:11,700
Come on.
I'm coming, I'm coming.

903
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,000
Let's go.

904
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,060
<i>Good evening, Peter.</i>

905
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,100
Hello? Hello?

906
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,230
<i>Congratulations on completing</i>

907
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:41,800
<i>the rigorous
training wheels protocol</i>

908
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,570
<i>and gaining access to
your suit's full capabilities.</i>

909
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:45,740
Ah, thank you.

910
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:47,800
<i>So, where would you like
to take me tonight?</i>

911
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:51,470
I put a tracker on someone.
He's a bad guy.

912
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,140
<i>Tracker located.</i>

913
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,680
<i>Plotting course
to intercept target.</i>

914
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,380
Okay, well, as long
as I make it back

915
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:00,320
in time for decathlon,
it's fine.

916
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:10,430
<i>One hundred meters
from destination and closing.</i>

917
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:12,660
<i>Jump now.</i>

918
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:18,270
<i>Detecting three individuals.</i>

919
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:20,570
Why is their secret lair

920
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:23,770
in a gas station?
That's so lame.

921
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,840
Hey, suit lady,
what are they doing?

922
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:29,780
<i>Do you want to hear
what they're saying?</i>

923
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:32,280
I can hear what
they're saying? Uh, yeah.

924
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,150
<i>Activating enhanced
reconnaissance mode.</i>

925
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:36,590
<i>I got the gauntlet
from the Lagos cleanup.</i>

926
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:38,350
<i>The rest is my design.</i>
Whoa, that's so cool.

927
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:41,560
<i>Can't believe they're still
cleaning the triskelion mess.</i>

928
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,690
<i>- I love it.
- They keep making messes,</i>

929
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,730
<i>- we keep getting rich.
- Target inbound.</i>

930
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:47,500
Whoa, they're in the middle
of a heist.

931
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,130
I could catch 'em all
red-handed. This is awesome.

932
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,570
Okay, I'm gonna
get a little closer

933
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:53,100
so I can see what's happening.

934
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,670
<i>Would you like me
to engage enhanced combat mode?</i>

935
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:58,340
"Enhanced combat mode"? Yeah.

936
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,540
<i>Activating instant kill.</i>

937
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:02,180
No, no, no, no. I don't want
to kill anybody.

938
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:05,450
<i>Deactivating instant kill.</i>

939
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:08,590
Did you hear that?

940
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:10,750
What the hell just happened?
What was that?

941
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:15,190
<i>You jumped off the sign
and landed on your face.</i>

942
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:17,260
Suit lady, what's wrong
with my web-shooters?

943
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:20,530
<i>Rapid-fire is the default
for enhanced combat mode.</i>

944
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:21,870
Why would I need rapid-fire?

945
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:23,630
<i>Would you like to see
more options?</i>

946
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,640
<i>You have 576 possible
web-shooter combinations.</i>

947
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,610
Mr. stark really overdid it.

948
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:29,640
You two wait right here.

949
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,670
Wait. You're gonna want
to turn on the dampers

950
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,540
or that thing will
shatter your arm.

951
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,450
All right, where's the dampers?

952
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:36,810
That one.
<i>Great choice.</i>

953
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:41,220
<i>Would you like me to set this
as your new default?</i>

954
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:42,890
No, no, no.
Push that in.

955
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:44,250
Right here?
No, the other...

956
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,490
This one here?
Yeah, push it.

957
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:47,590
What was that?
<i>Taser webs.</i>

958
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:49,260
Taser webs?
I don't want taser webs.

959
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:52,160
<i>You seem to be unfamiliar
with your web-shooter settings.</i>

960
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,560
<i>Would you like to run
a refresher course?</i>

961
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:56,400
No. Just... you choose.
<i>Sure thing.</i>

962
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,700
<i>Six-Alpha-niner,
are you running on time?</i>

963
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:04,710
Copy, central.
Six-Alpha-niner on schedule.

964
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:09,450
<i>I got a visual.</i>
Green light, green light.

965
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:15,350
Oh, that's him.

966
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:19,760
<i>Okay. I got eyes
on the convoy.</i>

967
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,660
<i>Pulling in behind the caboose.</i>

968
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,460
<i>Deploy anchors.</i>

969
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:37,670
<i>Dropping down.</i>

970
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:42,250
No outgoing distress signals.
You're all clear.

971
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:47,450
<i>Hey. Looks like they got
some good stuff here.</i>

972
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,960
Whoa, cool.

973
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,700
It's like some kind of
matter phase shifter.

974
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,300
<i>All right, coming up.</i>

975
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:13,310
Hey, big bird!
This doesn't belong to you.

976
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:15,550
Oh, god.

977
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:24,350
Suit lady, what was that?
<i>You told me to choose.</i>

978
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:27,660
What? No, just set everything
back to normal.

979
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:31,560
<i>Activating all systems.</i>

980
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,380
Oh, my head.

981
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:51,380
<i>You appear to have
a mild concussion.</i>

982
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:56,290
Hey, so where am i right now?

983
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:56,950
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

984
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,990
<i>The container walls
are hindering my sensors.</i>

985
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:02,890
Wait a minute.

986
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:04,460
They must have
hijacked the truck

987
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:06,630
and taken me to their evil lair.

988
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:09,000
Okay, suit lady,
we're gonna have to fight

989
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,300
our way out of this one.

990
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:15,040
Three, two, one!

991
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:21,540
What is this place?

992
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:22,710
Suit lady, where am I?

993
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:24,880
<i>You're in the most
secure facility</i>

994
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,920
<i>on the eastern seaboard.</i>

995
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,350
<i>The damage control
deep storage vault.</i>

996
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:30,490
No. Seriously?

997
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:36,360
<i>The door will most likely
remain closed until morning.</i>

998
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:36,960
Morning?

999
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,400
Hey, suit lady,
i kind of feel bad

1000
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,930
calling you "suit lady,"
you know?

1001
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:44,870
I think I should probably
give you a name...

1002
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:47,370
Like Liz.
No, no, no.

1003
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:49,810
God, that's...
That's weird.

1004
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:51,710
What about Karen?

1005
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:53,940
<i>You can call me Karen
if you would like.</i>

1006
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:58,110
Hey, Karen, what else
can this suit do?

1007
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,420
What?

1008
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:01,780
Maybe we should run
that refresher course.

1009
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:03,620
<i>Ricochet web.</i>
Ricochet web.

1010
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:07,720
Whoa! Cool.
<i>Splitter web.</i>

1011
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:11,660
<i>Web grenade.</i>
Web grenade!

1012
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:15,870
Should I tell Liz
that I'm spider-man?

1013
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:16,800
<i>Who is Liz?</i>

1014
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,800
Who's Liz?
She's... heh.

1015
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,500
She's the best.
She's awesome.

1016
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:24,440
She's just a girl
who goes to my school.

1017
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,480
And, uh...

1018
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,610
Yeah, I just...
I really want to tell her,

1019
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:29,780
but it's kind of weird,
you know?

1020
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:32,820
"Hey, I'm... I'm spider-man."

1021
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:33,950
<i>What's weird about that?</i>

1022
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:35,990
What if she's expecting
someone like Tony stark?

1023
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:39,020
Imagine how disappointed
she'd be when she sees me.

1024
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,120
<i>Well, if I were her,</i>

1025
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,760
<i>I wouldn't be
disappointed at all.</i>

1026
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,760
Thanks, Karen.

1027
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,060
It's really nice
to have somebody to talk to.

1028
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:48,770
Hey, how long
we been here anyways?

1029
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:50,730
<i>Thirty-seven minutes.</i>
What?

1030
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,940
Thirty-seven minutes?
That's insane.

1031
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:54,100
I cannot take this anymore.

1032
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,940
I got to...
I gotta get out of here.

1033
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:01,580
There's got to be something
in here I can use.

1034
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:04,180
Okay, let's see.

1035
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:06,720
Nope.

1036
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,020
That's awesome.

1037
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,050
Ah. Hey, it's like the glowy
thing.

1038
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:13,420
<i>That glowy thing is an
explosive chitauri energy core.</i>

1039
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:16,060
Whoa, whoa! You mean, we've been
carrying around a bomb?

1040
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:18,730
<i>It would require radiation
to transform it</i>

1041
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:20,600
<i>into an explosive state.</i>

1042
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,830
No, no, no, no, no.

1043
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:29,740
Hey! Please! Please, somebody,
let me out! Hey!

1044
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:32,610
Karen, you have to help me
override that time lock.

1045
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:35,450
Okay, Karen,
lower the voltage and run it.

1046
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:36,210
<i>Trial unsuccessful.</i>

1047
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:40,550
Okay, we're just gonna
have to try every sequence.

1048
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:45,150
Ned, Peter, we're gonna
be late. Come on, let's go.

1049
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:48,890
Okay. Hold on, hold on.

1050
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,600
<i>Initiating trial 247.</i>

1051
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:58,200
It worked. It works!

1052
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:12,680
Please be sure
all cell phones are turned off.

1053
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:13,480
Thank you.

1054
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,520
Karen, get me to the decathlon
as fast as possible.

1055
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,190
<i>Sure thing.
Just tell me where it is.</i>

1056
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:18,890
Across from
the Washington monument.

1057
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:20,490
<i>It's ned. Leave a message.</i>

1058
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:23,960
Ned, call me back!
The glowy thing's a bomb!

1059
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,270
<i>There's a vehicle approaching
on your right.</i>

1060
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:32,030
We have now entered
sudden death.

1061
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:36,240
The next correct answer
wins the championship.

1062
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:41,710
Midtown tech?

1063
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:42,810
Zero.

1064
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:43,910
That is correct.

1065
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,520
<i>Midtown takes the championship!</i>

1066
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,820
Whoo-hoo!
- We won!

1067
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:51,250
You guys, i am so proud of you.

1068
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:52,890
Told you we didn't need Peter.

1069
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:55,020
Flash, you didn't
answer one question.

1070
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:56,730
Taking it all in?
Oh, yeah, I just...

1071
00:58:56,730 --> 00:58:59,600
Um, I don't want
to celebrate something

1072
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,660
that was built by slaves.

1073
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:05,230
I'm sure the Washington monument
wasn't built by...

1074
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:07,270
Okay.

1075
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:10,010
Enjoy your book.
Thanks.

1076
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,740
Oh, ned, you're alive!
Peter, are you okay?

1077
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:16,250
Where's the glowy thing?
The glowy thing?

1078
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:18,280
Don't worry, it's safe.
It's in my backpack.

1079
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,980
Ned, listen!
The glowy thing is dangerous!

1080
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:21,850
You missed the decathlon.
I covered for you.

1081
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:24,290
Ned, listen to me!
We're at the Washington mon...

1082
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:25,760
Peter, is that you?
Hey, Liz.

1083
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,590
<i>Is that Liz?</i>
Put ned on the phone.

1084
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:29,690
<i>Tell her how you feel.</i>
You flake!

1085
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:30,760
You are so lucky we won.

1086
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,660
I want to be mad,
but I'm more worried.

1087
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:34,100
Like, what is going on with you?

1088
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:35,870
I have to talk to ned.
It's important!

1089
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:37,230
Miss, all items
on the belt, please.

1090
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,870
<i>There's something
in ned's backpack!</i>

1091
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:42,640
<i>It's dangerous. Don't let it
go through an X-ray.</i>

1092
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,880
Liz? Liz! Damn it.

1093
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:52,720
Mr. Harrison, can I be the one
to tell Peter he's expelled?

1094
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:59,190
The Washington monument
is 555 feet,

1095
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:02,690
five and one-eighth
inches tall.

1096
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:05,330
Notice how the marble
and granite

1097
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:08,230
are cut around the stone.

1098
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,340
Did you hear that?

1099
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:15,710
No, no, no.
Karen, what's going on up there?

1100
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:17,870
<i>The chitauri core has detonated</i>

1101
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,840
<i>and caused severe structural
damage to the elevator.</i>

1102
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,180
Oh, no.
My friends are up there.

1103
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:24,850
What? Don't worry, ma'am,
everything's gonna be okay.

1104
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:28,720
Excuse me, excuse me.
Oh, my god, that's tall.

1105
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,760
Oh, my god.
Look at the ceiling.

1106
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,130
Just stay calm, everyone.

1107
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:39,260
Oh, we are all
going to die here.

1108
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,830
<i>Estimating 10 minutes
before catastrophic failure.</i>

1109
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,970
We're freakin' screwed.

1110
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:46,400
Okay, I know that was scary,

1111
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,000
but our safety systems
are working.

1112
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:51,340
<i>The safety systems
are completely failing.</i>

1113
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:52,380
We're very safe in here.

1114
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:55,880
<i>The occupants are
in imminent mortal danger.</i>

1115
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,750
I'm going as fast as I can!

1116
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,220
Let's go.
Give me your hand.

1117
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:11,890
<i>You now have 125 seconds
until catastrophic failure.</i>

1118
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:14,930
What? Why?
<i>Unexpected motion has caused</i>

1119
01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:16,770
<i>the deterioration to escalate.</i>

1120
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:17,830
How do I get in there?

1121
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:21,070
<i>Activating reconnaissance drone.</i>

1122
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,740
Whoa. Has that been there
this whole time? That's awesome.

1123
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:28,680
<i>Locating optimal entry point.</i>

1124
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,150
<i>Proceed to southwest window.</i>

1125
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:33,920
Karen, I'm on my way.

1126
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:39,390
There's a lot of glass here.
You got this.

1127
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:41,260
Keep coming, keep coming.

1128
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,130
Ah!

1129
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:57,410
Okay. Oh, my god.

1130
01:01:57,410 --> 01:01:58,470
Okay.

1131
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:02,240
<i>What's wrong? You've reached
the southwest window.</i>

1132
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:04,050
<i>Why are you hesitating?</i>
It's fine.

1133
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:05,720
I've just never been
this high before.

1134
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,820
<i>You have also not
reinstalled your parachute,</i>

1135
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:12,350
<i>so a fall from this height
would most likely be lethal.</i>

1136
01:02:13,090 --> 01:02:14,160
Perfect.

1137
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,190
Oh, my god.

1138
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:18,860
Why is it not breaking?

1139
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,260
<i>It's four-inch
ballistic glass.</i>

1140
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:23,500
<i>You'll have to create
more momentum.</i>

1141
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:43,220
<i>This is D.C. Metro police.</i>

1142
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:46,090
<i>Identify yourself.</i>
My friends are in there! Stop!

1143
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:47,820
Return to the ground
immediately.

1144
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,790
Okay, who's next?
Me, it's my turn!

1145
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:51,990
- Flash, seriously?
- What are you doing?

1146
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,830
Come on.
Don't worry about the trophy.

1147
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:00,470
Ahh!

1148
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:03,870
<i>Stand down!</i>

1149
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:07,910
<i>Return to the ground
immediately!</i>

1150
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:13,520
Return to the ground
or we will open fire!

1151
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,420
Go up, go up.

1152
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:17,550
I got this.

1153
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,490
Take my trophy!

1154
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:23,260
This is your last chance!

1155
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:25,900
Oh, I'm gonna die.

1156
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:28,800
Look out!

1157
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:37,110
Ahh!

1158
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:51,950
I did it! Whoa!

1159
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:05,330
Ahem. Hey, how you doing?

1160
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,100
Don't worry about it.
I got you.

1161
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:08,970
Yes! Yes!
Hey, hey, hey.

1162
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:12,210
Big guy, quit moving around.
I'm sorry, sir. So sorry.

1163
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:17,350
Let's go, let's go!

1164
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,190
Okay, okay.

1165
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:25,120
Mr. harrington, go.
Ned, come on.

1166
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:27,320
This is your stop.
Come on, Liz.

1167
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:29,460
Go, go, go.
Everybody out!

1168
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:30,990
Move it, people.
Move it, move it!

1169
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,160
- Are you sure it's safe?
- Liz!

1170
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:40,570
You're okay. You're okay.

1171
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:45,370
Okay.

1172
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:46,610
Oh, my god.
Good, good.

1173
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:48,940
Come on up.
Come on, you guys, stay back.

1174
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:50,980
Come on in.
You guys good?

1175
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:53,620
So is everyone okay?

1176
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:56,550
<i>This is your chance, Peter.</i>

1177
01:04:56,550 --> 01:04:59,090
<i>Kiss her.</i>

1178
01:04:59,090 --> 01:05:01,890
Oh!

1179
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:03,530
Thank you.

1180
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:09,500
Are you really friends
with Peter Parker?

1181
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,370
I can finish the next order,

1182
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:21,310
but without any new materials
from that truck...

1183
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:23,410
Yeah, damn it.

1184
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:26,450
We still have enough to do
the gargan deal though, right?

1185
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:29,590
Yeah, but then that's it.

1186
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:34,420
Oh, maybe it is time that
i built the high-altitude seal.

1187
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:37,460
Would you shut up about that?
It's only one job.

1188
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:39,400
No.

1189
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,630
Eight years,
not a word from the feds,

1190
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:45,130
nothing from those
Halloween-costume-wearing bozos

1191
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:47,140
up there in stark tower.

1192
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:48,440
And then all of a sudden,

1193
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:51,370
this little bastard
in red tights shows up

1194
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:57,410
and he thinks he can tear down
everything I've built.

1195
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:00,120
Really?

1196
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,380
I'm gonna kill him.

1197
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:02,690
I'm gonna find him...
I found him.

1198
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:05,690
<i>Spider-man swooped in,
heroically saving</i>

1199
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:08,090
<i>an academic decathlon team
from queens.</i>

1200
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:13,400
<i>The identity of the masked hero
is still unknown.</i>

1201
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:16,370
Mom.
Okay. All right.

1202
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:20,300
Peter?
Come here, come here.

1203
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,300
Oh, my god.

1204
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:25,640
<i>This past weekend, midtown's
academic decathlon team</i>

1205
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:26,740

1206
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:28,410
<i>to win the national
championship.</i>

01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:30,280
<i>Later that day,
they also defeated death.</i>

1208
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,410
<i>Explosion. Sally scream.
Flash scream. All scream.</i>

1209
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:34,350
<i>There were purple lasers
and smoke everywhere.</i>

1210
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:36,550
<i>It was tight,
like a bon jovi concert.</i>

1211
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:38,290
<i>As you know,
we made it out alive,</i>

1212
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:39,990
<i>and that's the important thing.</i>

1213
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:44,460
<i>I couldn't bear to lose
a student on a school trip.</i>

1214
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:46,030
<i>Not again.</i>

1215
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:48,700
<i>Thankfully, no one was
seriously injured,</i>

1216
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:49,770
<i>thanks to the spider-man.</i>

1217
01:06:49,770 --> 01:06:51,670
<i>Thank you, spider-man.
Thank you, spider-man.</i>

1218
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:55,270
<i>Up next: The spider-man mania
is sweeping the school.</i>

1219
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:58,470
<i>How can you show
your spider spirit?</i>

1220
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,550
Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.

1221
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:07,050
What is it like being famous
when nobody knows it's you?

1222
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:08,550
Crazy, dude.
It's crazy.

1223
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:10,690
Should we tell everyone?
No.

1224
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:11,790
Should I tell everyone?

1225
01:07:11,790 --> 01:07:13,390
No, dude.
That's not a good idea.

1226
01:07:13,390 --> 01:07:15,160
Okay, come on,
we'll be late to class.

1227
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,360
I'm not going to class.
You're already in trouble

1228
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:20,360
for ditching the decathlon.
Dude, listen, I figured it out.

1229
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,600
The wingsuit guy is stealing
from damage control.

1230
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,470
What he takes
from damage control,

1231
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:25,800
that's how he builds
the weapons.

1232
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,300
So all I gotta do is catch him.

1233
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:28,600
But we have a Spanish quiz.

1234
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:31,040
Ned, I'm probably never
gonna come back here.

1235
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,280
Mr. stark is moving
the avengers upstate

1236
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,480
so when I bring this guy in...
Dude.

1237
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,550
You want to be
a high school dropout?

1238
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:42,050
I am so far beyond
high school right now.

1239
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:45,520
Parker, my office.

1240
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,760
<i>So...</i>

1241
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:49,830
<i>You got detention.</i>

1242
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:52,260
<i>You screwed up. You know
what you did was wrong.</i>

1243
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:55,230
<i>The question is, how are
you gonna make things right?</i>

1244
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:56,730
<i>Maybe you were
trying to be cool.</i>

1245
01:07:56,730 --> 01:07:59,500
<i>But take it from a guy
who's been frozen for 65 years,</i>

1246
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:02,640
<i>the only way to really be cool
is to follow the rules.</i>

1247
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:06,240
<i>We all know what's right.
We all know what's wrong.</i>

1248
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,810
<i>Next time those turkeys try
to convince you of something</i>

1249
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:11,450
<i>you know is wrong...</i>
Where you going? Get back here.

1250
01:08:11,450 --> 01:08:14,150
<i>Just think to yourself,
what would captain America do?</i>

1251
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:16,490
Why are you here?
You don't even have detention.

1252
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:18,850
Oh, I know.
I just like coming here

1253
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:21,420
to sketch people in crisis.

1254
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:25,560
Heh. It's you.

1255
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:26,730
<i>So your body's changing.</i>

1256
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:30,430
<i>Believe me,
I know how that feels.</i>

1257
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:42,850
May?

1258
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:46,620
Hey, Karen. What's up?

1259
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:49,120
<i>- Hey, Peter.
- How was your Spanish quiz?</i>

1260
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,590
I was wondering
if you could help me.

1261
01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:52,350
I'm trying to figure out
who the guys

1262
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:53,590
under the bridge
were that night,

1263
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:55,590
but I can only remember
part of a license plate.

1264
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:57,160
<i>I can run facial recognition</i>

1265
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,860
<i>on the footage
of that encounter.</i>

1266
01:08:58,860 --> 01:08:59,900
Footage?
<i>Yes, Peter.</i>

1267
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:01,800
<i>I record everything you see.</i>

1268
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,870
Everything? Like, all the time?
<i>Everything.</i>

1269
01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:06,470
<i>It's called
the baby-monitor protocol.</i>

1270
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:08,270
Yeah, of course it is.

1271
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:12,570
Um, yeah, just roll it back
to last Friday.

1272
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:13,440
<i>With pleasure.</i>

1273
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,140
<i>Hey, everyone.
Yeah, kick-ass party.</i>

1274
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:17,450
<i>What's up, Liz? Peter's told me
a lot about you.</i>

1275
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:19,620
No, no, no.
This is just me messing around.

1276
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:21,620
Go later in the day,
later in the day.

1277
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:24,190
<i>It is I, Thor, son of Odin!</i>

1278
01:09:24,190 --> 01:09:25,720
No, no, no.
That's definitely...

1279
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:27,360
That's not
what we wanted to watch.

1280
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:29,320
<i>Your impressions are very funny.</i>

1281
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:31,660
Fast-forward
to the arms deal.

1282
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:32,460
Okay.

1283
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:34,160
The two on the right,
who are they?

1284
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,700
<i>Searching law enforcement
databases.</i>

1285
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:39,200
<i>No records found
for two of the individuals.</i>

1286
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,700
Nothing?
<i>One individual identified.</i>

1287
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:42,770
<i>Aaron Davis, age 33.</i>

1288
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:46,840
<i>He has a criminal record
and an address here in queens.</i>

1289
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:48,180
Let's pay him a visit.

1290
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:49,580
<i>Would you like me to activate</i>

1291
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:52,210
<i>the enhanced
interrogation protocol?</i>

1292
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:53,250
Uh, yeah.

1293
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:09,430
Remember me?
Hey...

1294
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:11,830
I need information.
You'll give it to me now.

1295
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,440
All right, chill.
Come on!

1296
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:16,570
What happened to your voice?
What do you mean?

1297
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:19,440
I heard you by the bridge.
I know what a girl sound like.

1298
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,840
I'm not a girl!
I'm a boy.

1299
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:22,310
I mean,
I'm a... I'm a man.

1300
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:24,480
I don't care what you are,
a boy, a girl...

1301
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,480
I'm not a girl!
I'm a man.

1302
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,420
Come on, man.

1303
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:28,750
Look, who is selling
these weapons?

1304
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:32,350
I need to know.
Give me names or else.

1305
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:36,430
You ain't ever
done this before, huh?

1306
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:40,230
Deactivate interrogation mode.

1307
01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:41,760
Look, man,

1308
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:44,800
these guys are selling weapons
that are crazy dangerous.

1309
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,400
They can't be out
on the streets.

1310
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,570
If one of them can cut
delmar's bodega in half...

1311
01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:51,510
You know delmar's?
Yeah, best sandwich in queens.

1312
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:53,880
Sub haven's pretty good.
It's too much bread.

1313
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:57,450
I like bread.
Come on, man, please.

1314
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:01,250
Stupid interrogation mode.
Karen, don't ever do that again.

1315
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:02,820
The other night,
you told that dude,

1316
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:05,450
"if you shoot somebody,
shoot me."

1317
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:06,420
It's pretty ballsy.

1318
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:08,960
I don't want those weapons
in this neighborhood.

1319
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:11,630
I got a nephew who live here.

1320
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:12,660
Who are these guys?

1321
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:14,530
What can you tell me
about the guy with the wings?

1322
01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:17,430
Other than he's a psychopath
dressed like a demon, nothing.

1323
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:20,570
I don't know who he is
or where he is.

1324
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:25,770
I do know where he's gonna be.
Really?

1325
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:28,340
Yeah, this crazy dude
i used to work with,

1326
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:31,450
he's supposed
to be doing a deal with him.

1327
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:32,880
Yes! Heh. Yes.

1328
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,020
Thank...
Hey. Hey. Hey.

1329
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:36,590
I didn't tell you where.
You don't have a location.

1330
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:40,460
Right, of course.
Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just...

1331
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:41,060
Yeah.

1332
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:43,560
Where is it?
Can I give you some advice?

1333
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:44,760
Hm?
You got to get better

1334
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:48,300
at this part of the job.
I don't understand.

1335
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:49,670
I'm intimidating.

1336
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:52,570
Staten island ferry, 11.
Oh, that's soon.

1337
01:11:52,570 --> 01:11:54,770
Hey, that's gonna dissolve
in two hours.

1338
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:57,010
No, no, no, no.
Come fix this.

1339
01:11:57,010 --> 01:11:59,310
Two hours. You deserve that.
I got ice cream in here.

1340
01:11:59,310 --> 01:12:02,480
You deserve that. You're a
criminal. Bye, Mr. criminal.

1341
01:12:17,090 --> 01:12:18,960
Nice.

1342
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:23,730
Okay, Karen, activate
enhanced reconnaissance mode.

1343
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:24,930
<i>Sure thing.</i>

1344
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:27,800
<i>He's up front, main deck.</i>

1345
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:29,000
I hate this guy.

1346
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:30,610
It's the guy
from the bridge, right?

1347
01:12:30,610 --> 01:12:32,070
Who's that other guy?
Just keep me posted.

1348
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:35,110
<i>There's no record of him
in my criminal database.</i>

1349
01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:36,780
<i>Incoming call from may Parker.</i>

1350
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:38,580
<i>Should I reroute
to your heads-up display?</i>

1351
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:41,050
I can't talk right now.
I'll call her back.

1352
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:43,750
Hey, dronie,
keep an eye on that guy.

1353
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:47,360
We can't let anybody
get away this time.

1354
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:56,060
- Who's the guy on the left?
<i>- Mac gargan.</i>

1355
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:58,700
<i>Extensive criminal record,
including homicide.</i>

1356
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:00,700
<i>Would you like me
to activate instant kill?</i>

1357
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:04,070
No, Karen, stop it
with the instant kill already.

1358
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:09,380
White pickup truck.

1359
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:15,880
Dronie, scan the ship
for a white pickup truck.

1360
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,510
Oh, this is too perfect.

1361
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:39,070
They got the weapons, buyers
and sellers in one place.

1362
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:42,510
<i>Incoming call from Tony stark.</i>
No, no, no.

1363
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:44,150
Don't answer.
<i>Mr. Parker. Got a sec?</i>

1364
01:13:44,150 --> 01:13:47,580
- Uh, I'm actually at school.
<i>- No, you're not.</i>

1365
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:49,020
<i>Nice work in D.C.</i>
okay.

1366
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:52,020
<i>My dad never really gave me
a lot of support</i>

1367
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:53,990
<i>and I'm trying to break
the cycle of shame.</i>

1368
01:13:53,990 --> 01:13:55,690
I'm kind of in the middle
of something.

1369
01:13:55,690 --> 01:13:57,960
<i>Don't cut me off
when I'm complimenting you.</i>

1370
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:00,900
<i>Anyway, great things are
about to... what is that?</i>

1371
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:02,860
I'm at band practice.

1372
01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:07,640
<i>That's odd. Happy told me
you quit band six weeks ago.</i>

1373
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:09,570
<i>What's up?</i>
I gotta go!

1374
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:11,210
End call.
<i>Hey.</i>

1375
01:14:11,210 --> 01:14:13,510
I'll take those!

1376
01:14:13,510 --> 01:14:14,840
Yoink!

1377
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:18,750
Hey, guys. The illegal
weapons-deal ferry was at 10:30.

1378
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:20,720
You missed it!

1379
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:22,920
Whoo!

1380
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,790
<i>Spider guy's here.</i>

1381
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:34,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Not so fast.

1382
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:35,460
Ah!

1383
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:38,630
Are you guys okay?
My bad. That was a little hard.

1384
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:42,900
I got to say, the other guy
was way better with that thing.

1385
01:14:42,910 --> 01:14:44,740
I'm honestly...

1386
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:46,480
I'm... I'm shocked.

1387
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:00,820
Freeze! FBI!
Don't move!

1388
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:02,020
Get on the ground!
FBI!

1389
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:04,560
What do you mean, FBI?
<i>The federal bureau of invest...</i>

1390
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:07,860
I know what "FBI" means.
But what are they doing here?

1391
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:12,000
What the...?

1392
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:17,810
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

1393
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:18,770
Go, go, go, go!

1394
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:21,110
Get out of there!
Whoa!

1395
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:24,080
Look out! Look out!
Move! Move! Move!

1396
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:31,290
- Move!
- Get to the top deck.

1397
01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:34,090
We're getting out of here.

1398
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:53,980
Ah! Ah!

1399
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:13,930
Activate taser web!

1400
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:28,010
You're messing with things
you don't understand.

1401
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,220
Oh, my god. What do I do?

1402
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:10,890
Karen, give me
an X-ray of the boat

1403
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:13,860
and target all
the strongest points.

1404
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:17,890
Web grenade. Web grenade.

1405
01:17:20,130 --> 01:17:23,100
Splitter web, go.

1406
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:53,260
<i>- Great job, Peter.
- You are 98 percent successful.</i>

1407
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:56,730
Ninety-eight?
Yeah, spider-man!

1408
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:01,740
No, no, no. No!

1409
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:06,710
No!

1410
01:18:12,450 --> 01:18:15,020
Oh, my god!

1411
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:20,790
No! Ah!

1412
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:37,140
What the hell?

1413
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:43,040
What the hell?

1414
01:18:43,950 --> 01:18:45,880
<i>Hi, spider-man.</i>

1415
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:49,220
<i>Band practice, was it?</i>

1416
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:55,790
Look! Look!

1417
01:19:09,810 --> 01:19:12,040
Yeah, iron man!

1418
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:21,250
Uh, Mr. stark.

1419
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:24,220
Hey, Mr. stark,
could I do anything?

1420
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:26,150
What do you want me
to do? Whoa!

1421
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:30,290
<i>I think you've done enough.</i>

1422
01:19:42,810 --> 01:19:47,240
- So that's it?
- You're just gonna run?

1423
01:19:48,910 --> 01:19:51,280
Feds were waiting for us.

1424
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:54,950
Now we're on iron man's radar?

1425
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:57,950
Yeah, I'm running.

1426
01:19:57,950 --> 01:19:58,890
You should too.

1427
01:19:58,890 --> 01:20:01,560
You know i can't do that.

1428
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:02,390
So now what?

1429
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:05,330
Mason, can you get
that high-altitude

1430
01:20:05,330 --> 01:20:08,160
seal thing up
and running in time?

1431
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:09,360
Seriously?

1432
01:20:09,370 --> 01:20:13,170
Yes. You will not
regret this.

1433
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:17,340
You in?

1434
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:29,850
<i>Previously on</i>
Peter screws the pooch,

1435
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:31,350
<i>I tell you
to stay away from this.</i>

1436
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:34,260
<i>Instead, you hacked
a multimillion-dollar suit</i>

1437
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:36,360
<i>so you could sneak around
behind my back</i>

1438
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:40,160
<i>doing the one thing
I told you not to do.</i>

1439
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:41,330
Is everyone okay?

1440
01:20:41,330 --> 01:20:45,330
<i>No thanks to you.</i>

1441
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:47,900
No thanks to me?

1442
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:50,070
Those weapons were out there

1443
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:51,940
and I tried
to tell you about it,

1444
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:52,940
but you didn't listen.

1445
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:54,310
None of this would've happened

1446
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:55,540
if you had just listened to me.

1447
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:59,880
If you even cared,
you'd actually be here.

1448
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:04,390
I did listen, kid.

1449
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:06,020
Who do you think
called the FBI, huh?

1450
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:09,290
Do you know I was the only
one who believed in you?

1451
01:21:09,290 --> 01:21:11,190
Everyone else said I was crazy

1452
01:21:11,190 --> 01:21:13,600
to recruit a 14-year-old kid.
I'm 15.

1453
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,960
No. This is where
you zip it, all right?

1454
01:21:15,970 --> 01:21:16,970
The adult is talking.

1455
01:21:16,970 --> 01:21:18,370
What if somebody
had died tonight?

1456
01:21:18,370 --> 01:21:22,070
Different story, right?
'Cause that's on you.

1457
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:23,200
And if you died,

1458
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:25,140
I feel like that's on me.

1459
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:27,580
I don't need that
on my conscience.

1460
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:28,940
Yes, sir, I'm sorry.
Yes.

1461
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:31,180
I understand.
Sorry doesn't cut it.

1462
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:33,050
I just wanted to be like you.

1463
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:35,650
And I wanted you to be better.

1464
01:21:36,290 --> 01:21:37,620
Okay, it's not working out.

1465
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:39,050
I'm gonna need the suit back.

1466
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,890
For how long?
Forever.

1467
01:21:40,890 --> 01:21:43,290
Yeah, that's how it works.
No, no. Please. Please.

1468
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:44,660
Let's have it.
You don't understand.

1469
01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:47,030
This is all I have.
I'm nothing without this suit.

1470
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:49,030
If you're nothing
without this suit,

1471
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:51,630
then you shouldn't
have it, okay?

1472
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:54,540
God, I sound like my dad.

1473
01:21:55,570 --> 01:21:57,970
I don't have any other clothes.

1474
01:21:57,970 --> 01:22:00,510
Okay, we'll sort that out.

1475
01:22:10,690 --> 01:22:13,250
Hey.

1476
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:18,390
I've been calling you all day.

1477
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,430
You didn't answer your phone.

1478
01:22:20,430 --> 01:22:21,630
You can't do that.

1479
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:24,500
Then this ferry thing happens.

1480
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:27,300
I've called five police
stations.

1481
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:29,670
Five. I called five
of your friends.

1482
01:22:29,670 --> 01:22:32,140
I called ned's mother.
I'm fine. May, I'm okay.

1483
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:35,210
Honestly, just relax.
I'm fine.

1484
01:22:35,210 --> 01:22:38,110
Cut the bullshit.
I know you left detention.

1485
01:22:38,110 --> 01:22:40,420
I know you left the hotel
room in Washington.

1486
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:43,450
I know you sneak out
of this house every night.

1487
01:22:43,450 --> 01:22:44,420
That's not fine.

1488
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:46,650
Peter, you have to tell
me what's going on.

1489
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:50,590
Just lay it out.
It's just me and you.

1490
01:22:51,290 --> 01:22:53,430
I lost the stark internship.

1491
01:22:53,430 --> 01:22:55,660
What?
Yeah.

1492
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:56,600
What happened?

1493
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:59,300
I just thought that
i could work really hard

1494
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:01,700
and he could...
He would... you know.

1495
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:05,040
But... I screwed it up.

1496
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,710
Oh, it's okay, it's okay.

1497
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:10,650
It's okay.

1498
01:23:10,650 --> 01:23:13,180
I'm sorry i made you worry.

1499
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:15,980
You know I'm not trying
to ruin your life.

1500
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:17,420
Yeah, I know.

1501
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:18,450
Just...

1502
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:21,990
I used to sneak out too.
Yeah.

1503
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:25,760
And take a shower.
You smell.

1504
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:29,360
You smell like...
You smell like garbage.

1505
01:23:29,370 --> 01:23:31,470
I know.

1506
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:36,040
Peter, you're a good kid
and you're a smart kid,

1507
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:39,740
so just try to keep
your head straight, okay?

1508
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:40,740
Okay.

1509
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:44,010
All right, get out of here.

1510
01:23:50,790 --> 01:23:51,790
Are you expelled?

1511
01:23:51,790 --> 01:23:53,490
Do you have to go to
that school on 46th

1512
01:23:53,490 --> 01:23:55,260
where their principal
has a crossbow?

1513
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:56,720
Pretty sure that's
an urban myth,

1514
01:23:56,730 --> 01:23:59,630
and, no, I'm not expelled.

1515
01:23:59,630 --> 01:24:01,560
You're so lucky.

1516
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:26,550
<i>Muy bueno, señor Parker.</i>

1517
01:24:50,150 --> 01:24:52,180
Hey.

1518
01:24:52,180 --> 01:24:53,780
I thought you had
calculus fifth period.

1519
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:57,320
Yeah, I was just doing
some homecoming stuff.

1520
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:58,820
Hey, look, i...

1521
01:24:58,820 --> 01:25:00,720
I just wanted to apologize

1522
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:03,090
about the whole decathlon thing.

1523
01:25:03,090 --> 01:25:03,690
It's fine.

1524
01:25:03,690 --> 01:25:06,290
Last week, decathlon was
the most important thing,

1525
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:08,160
but then i almost died.

1526
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:10,300
No, I just...
I'm...

1527
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:11,870
I just mean that

1528
01:25:11,870 --> 01:25:15,800
it was not cool, especially...

1529
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:19,710
Because...

1530
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:23,280
I like you.

1531
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:25,350
I know.

1532
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:28,250
You do?

1533
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:31,250
You're terrible
at keeping secrets.

1534
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:33,820
Yeah, you'd be surprised.

1535
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:38,660
I got to get to class, but...

1536
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:40,130
I'd say we should hang out,

1537
01:25:40,130 --> 01:25:42,430
but I'm gonna be in
detention for...

1538
01:25:42,430 --> 01:25:45,570
Uh-huh.
Ever, but...

1539
01:25:45,570 --> 01:25:48,640
I guess you already have
a date to homecoming.

1540
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,370
Actually, I was so busy
planning it,

1541
01:25:50,370 --> 01:25:55,240
I never really got around
to that part, so...

1542
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:56,810
Uh, you want to

1543
01:25:56,810 --> 01:25:59,210
go with me?

1544
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:00,680
Yeah. Sure.

1545
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:03,920
Really? I mean, great. Cool.

1546
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,250
Cool.

1547
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:09,390
I'm actually going that way.

1548
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:22,370
May, I need your help.

1549
01:26:43,930 --> 01:26:45,230
Right?

1550
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:58,440
- It's game day.
- So what's the plan?

1551
01:26:58,440 --> 01:26:59,770
Open the door for her.
Mm-hm.

1552
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:01,640
Tell her she looks nice,
but not too much

1553
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:03,780
because that's creepy.
Don't be creepy.

1554
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:05,310
No. And when I dance
with her,

1555
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:08,750
I'm putting my hands
on her hips. I got this.

1556
01:27:11,290 --> 01:27:12,390
- Love you.
- Bye.

1557
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:29,400
You must be Peter.

1558
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:31,010
Yeah.

1559
01:27:31,010 --> 01:27:32,770
I'm Liz's dad.

1560
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:34,810
Put 'er there.

1561
01:27:34,810 --> 01:27:36,440
Hell of a grip.

1562
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:39,510
Come on in here.
Come on.

1563
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:03,740
Hi, Peter.

1564
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:05,910
You look very handsome.

1565
01:28:05,910 --> 01:28:06,910
Thank you.

1566
01:28:06,910 --> 01:28:09,880
You got his name right?

1567
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:11,480
Freddie?
Peter.

1568
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:13,550
Peter. Peter.

1569
01:28:13,550 --> 01:28:15,380
I'm gonna go get Liz.

1570
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:17,490
Okay.

1571
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:24,530
You all right, Pete?

1572
01:28:24,530 --> 01:28:25,460
Yeah.

1573
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:28,860
Because you look pale.

1574
01:28:29,530 --> 01:28:31,300
You want something to drink?

1575
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:32,030
Like a bourbon

1576
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:33,670
or a scotch,
or something like that?

1577
01:28:33,670 --> 01:28:35,440
I'm not old enough to drink.

1578
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,410
That's the right answer.

1579
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:41,640
Wow!
Wow, wow, wow,

1580
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:42,710
do you look beautiful.

1581
01:28:42,710 --> 01:28:44,650
Please don't embarrass me, dad.

1582
01:28:44,650 --> 01:28:45,850
Doesn't she, Pete?

1583
01:28:45,850 --> 01:28:47,820
Yeah, you look really good.

1584
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:51,050
Once again,
that's the right answer.

1585
01:28:51,050 --> 01:28:53,650
Is that a corsage?

1586
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:56,020
Thanks.

1587
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:57,690
Well, hey, I'm your chauffeur,

1588
01:28:57,690 --> 01:28:59,630
so let's get this
show on the road.

1589
01:28:59,630 --> 01:29:00,930
No, no, no, we have to take

1590
01:29:00,930 --> 01:29:02,900
some pictures, babe.
All right.

1591
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:05,500
Oh, right here. Perfect.
Mom.

1592
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:07,470
Okay. Come on,
you guys.

1593
01:29:07,470 --> 01:29:10,540
Peter, closer.

1594
01:29:11,510 --> 01:29:12,970
Smile.

1595
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:15,910
There you go.

1596
01:29:15,910 --> 01:29:17,380
Oh.

1597
01:29:20,580 --> 01:29:22,120
Sir, you don't have to drive us.

1598
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:23,720
Nah, nah, it's not a big deal.

1599
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:26,520
I'm going out of town.
It's right on my way.

1600
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:27,890
He's always coming and going.

1601
01:29:27,890 --> 01:29:29,390
Last time.
Have fun.

1602
01:29:29,390 --> 01:29:30,460
Thank you.
Promise.

1603
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:32,760
He's cute.
Shh.

1604
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,030
See you in a couple of days.

1605
01:29:35,030 --> 01:29:36,700
Bye, baby.
All right.

1606
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:37,900
Come on, Pedro.

1607
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:40,030
Bye, Peter. Have fun.
Yeah, I will.

1608
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:52,380
What are you gonna do, Pete?

1609
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:52,980
What?

1610
01:29:52,980 --> 01:29:55,120
When you graduate,
what do you think you'll do?

1611
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:58,520
Oh, I don't know.
Don't grill him, dad.

1612
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:00,760
Just saying, you know.

1613
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:02,520
All you guys
who go to that school

1614
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:05,490
you pretty much have your
life planned out, right?

1615
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,730
Yeah, no, I'm just a sophomore.

1616
01:30:07,730 --> 01:30:10,130
Peter has an internship
with Tony stark.

1617
01:30:10,130 --> 01:30:12,170
So I think he doesn't
have to worry.

1618
01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:13,730
Really?
Mm-hm.

1619
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:15,870
- Stark?
- So cool.

1620
01:30:15,870 --> 01:30:18,070
Oh. What do you do?

1621
01:30:18,070 --> 01:30:21,780
Actually, I don't
intern for him anymore.

1622
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:24,750
Seriously?
Yeah, it got...

1623
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:26,510
Boring.

1624
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:27,450
It was boring?

1625
01:30:27,450 --> 01:30:29,580
You got to hang out
with spider-man.

1626
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:31,490
Really? Spider-man?

1627
01:30:31,490 --> 01:30:34,720
Wow.
What's he like?

1628
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:37,020
Yeah, he's nice.

1629
01:30:37,030 --> 01:30:40,530
Nice man. Solid dude.

1630
01:30:41,930 --> 01:30:44,000
Hm.

1631
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,130
Look. So cute.

1632
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:48,970
Oh.

1633
01:30:50,870 --> 01:30:53,040
I've seen you around, right?

1634
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,610
I mean, somewhere.

1635
01:30:54,610 --> 01:30:57,450
We've... have we ever...?
Because even the voice...

1636
01:30:57,450 --> 01:30:59,880
He does academic
decathlon with me.

1637
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:01,720
Oh.
And he was at my party.

1638
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:03,950
- Ah.
- It was a great party.

1639
01:31:03,950 --> 01:31:05,120
Really great, yeah.

1640
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:07,020
Beautiful house,
a lot of windows.

1641
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:09,760
You were there for,
like, two seconds.

1642
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:10,790
That was...

1643
01:31:10,790 --> 01:31:12,960
I was there longer
than two seconds.

1644
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:15,060
You disappeared.
No.

1645
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:17,670
No, I did not disappear.
Yes, you did.

1646
01:31:17,670 --> 01:31:19,230
You disappeared
like you always do.

1647
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:21,070
Like you did
in D.C. too.

1648
01:31:27,810 --> 01:31:29,480
That's terrible

1649
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:32,680
what happened down
there in D.C. though.

1650
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:34,220
Were you scared?

1651
01:31:34,220 --> 01:31:37,120
I'll bet you were glad
when your old pal spider-man

1652
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:40,720
showed up in the elevator
though, huh?

1653
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,190
Yeah, well, I actually
didn't go up.

1654
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:46,530
I saw it all from the ground.

1655
01:31:46,530 --> 01:31:48,500
Yeah.

1656
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:51,930
Very lucky that
he was there that day.

1657
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:57,070
Good old spider-man.

1658
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:03,240
Dad, the light.

1659
01:32:17,730 --> 01:32:20,130
Here we are.
End of the line.

1660
01:32:20,130 --> 01:32:21,600
Thanks, dad.

1661
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:23,200
You head in there, gumdrop.

1662
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:27,540
I'm gonna give Peter
the "dad" talk.

1663
01:32:28,070 --> 01:32:30,240
Don't let him intimidate you.

1664
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:31,540
Love you.

1665
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:34,240
Love you, gumdrop.
Have a safe flight.

1666
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:36,610
Hi.

1667
01:32:36,610 --> 01:32:39,980
You guys look so pretty.

1668
01:32:43,790 --> 01:32:45,290
Does she know?

1669
01:32:45,290 --> 01:32:47,320
Know what?

1670
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:49,090
So she doesn't. Good.

1671
01:32:49,090 --> 01:32:52,160
Close to the vest.
I admire that.

1672
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:54,930
I've got a few secrets
of my own.

1673
01:32:54,930 --> 01:32:56,030
Of all the reasons

1674
01:32:56,030 --> 01:32:59,830
I didn't want
my daughter to date...

1675
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:02,570
Peter,

1676
01:33:02,570 --> 01:33:05,010
nothing is more important
than family.

1677
01:33:05,010 --> 01:33:06,740
You saved my daughter's life.

1678
01:33:06,740 --> 01:33:08,910
I could never forget
something like that.

1679
01:33:08,910 --> 01:33:11,280
So I'm gonna give you
one chance.

1680
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:12,180
Are you ready?

1681
01:33:12,180 --> 01:33:13,950
You walk through those doors,

1682
01:33:13,950 --> 01:33:16,150
you forget any of this happened

1683
01:33:16,150 --> 01:33:18,190
and don't you ever,

1684
01:33:18,190 --> 01:33:19,290
ever

1685
01:33:19,290 --> 01:33:22,860
interfere with
my business again.

1686
01:33:22,860 --> 01:33:24,930
'Cause if you do,

1687
01:33:24,930 --> 01:33:26,860
I'll kill you

1688
01:33:26,860 --> 01:33:30,030
and everybody you love.

1689
01:33:30,030 --> 01:33:31,370
I'll kill you dead.

1690
01:33:31,370 --> 01:33:34,130
That's what I'll do
to protect my family, Pete.

1691
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:37,140
Do you understand?

1692
01:33:37,140 --> 01:33:38,940
Hey.

1693
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:43,880
I just saved your life.
Now what do you say?

1694
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:46,010
Thank you.

1695
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:48,320
You're welcome.

1696
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:50,220
Now, you go on in there,

1697
01:33:50,220 --> 01:33:54,290
you show my daughter
a good time, okay?

1698
01:33:54,290 --> 01:33:57,260
Just not too good.

1699
01:34:50,780 --> 01:34:51,410
Hey.

1700
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:56,220
What did he say to you?

1701
01:34:59,290 --> 01:35:01,960
I've got to go.

1702
01:35:02,820 --> 01:35:04,830
I'm... I'm sorry.

1703
01:35:04,830 --> 01:35:07,830
You don't deserve this.

1704
01:35:25,150 --> 01:35:28,220
Ah!

1705
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:29,420
He gave you a choice.

1706
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:31,850
You chose wrong.
What the hell?

1707
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:34,090
What's with the crappy costume?

1708
01:35:36,190 --> 01:35:38,230
My web-shooters.

1709
01:35:43,030 --> 01:35:45,070
Whoa!

1710
01:35:45,770 --> 01:35:48,440
I wasn't sure about
this thing at first,

1711
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:51,240
but... Damn.

1712
01:35:55,210 --> 01:35:58,310
Oh, gross.

1713
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:12,830
Why did he send you here?
Guess you'll never know.

1714
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:19,100
Huh? Nice shot!

1715
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:24,240
Yes!

1716
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:26,240
Ned, the guy with
the wings is Liz's dad.

1717
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:28,040
What?
I know. I gotta tell Mr. stark.

1718
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:31,180
Call happy hogan. He's
Mr. stark's head of security.

1719
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:32,810
Get a computer and
track my phone for me.

1720
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:35,450
Are you gonna be okay?
Hurry, we gotta catch him

1721
01:36:35,450 --> 01:36:37,850
before he leaves town.

1722
01:36:37,850 --> 01:36:38,950
I'm sorry about dinner,

1723
01:36:38,950 --> 01:36:41,520
but I know when
branzino's fresh,

1724
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:43,490
and that was not fresh, okay?

1725
01:36:43,490 --> 01:36:44,320
So... ah!

1726
01:36:44,330 --> 01:36:46,860
Flash, I need
your car and your phone.

1727
01:36:46,860 --> 01:36:50,160
Sir, technically, this is my
dad's car, sir, so I can't...

1728
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:54,570
Ah!

1729
01:36:57,870 --> 01:37:00,510
Hello, ned? Hey, hey,
can you hear me?

1730
01:37:00,510 --> 01:37:01,410
Go for ned.

1731
01:37:01,410 --> 01:37:04,010
Ned, I need you
to track my phone for me.

1732
01:37:04,010 --> 01:37:07,310
Yeah, but where is it?

1733
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:10,520
Genius move.
Okay, he just passed

1734
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:12,050
the gamestop on Jackson Avenue.

1735
01:37:12,050 --> 01:37:14,220
Hey, where are the headlights
on this thing?

1736
01:37:14,220 --> 01:37:16,560
I'm in flash's car.
I'll pull the specs.

1737
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:18,060
Okay, you're on speakerphone.

1738
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:20,230
You stole flash's car?
Awesome.

1739
01:37:20,230 --> 01:37:21,860
Yeah, it's awesome!
It's awe...

1740
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:23,100
Oh!
Get out of the way!

1741
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:24,460
Get out of the way!
Move! Move!

1742
01:37:24,470 --> 01:37:26,830
Peter, are you okay?
<i>I've never driven before.</i>

1743
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:28,370
Only with may in parking lots.

1744
01:37:28,370 --> 01:37:31,040
This is a huge step up.
Whoa!

1745
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:33,610
<i>Hey, have you gotten
through to happy yet?</i>

1746
01:37:33,610 --> 01:37:35,110
Uh, yeah.
I'm working on it.

1747
01:37:35,110 --> 01:37:38,280
I just gotta backdoor
the phone system.

1748
01:37:40,580 --> 01:37:43,380
Guy in the chair.

1749
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:48,620
<i>Takeoff in nine minutes.</i>

1750
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:50,620
<i>Hello? Hello?
Who is this?</i>

1751
01:37:50,630 --> 01:37:52,230
Mr. happy, it's ned.
<i>Who?</i>

1752
01:37:52,230 --> 01:37:53,590
I'm an associate
of Peter Parker.

1753
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:55,300
Got something important
to tell you...

1754
01:37:55,300 --> 01:37:58,070
<i>You gotta be shitting me.</i>
Damn.

1755
01:37:58,070 --> 01:38:01,200
Hey, ned, how we coming
with those headlights?

1756
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:02,000
Uh...

1757
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,540
Round knob to the left
of the steering wheel,

1758
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:06,240
<i>turn clockwise.</i>
Left, okay.

1759
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:08,210
Okay, perfect.
So where's my phone now?

1760
01:38:08,210 --> 01:38:11,980
Um... He stopped in an old
industrial park in Brooklyn.

1761
01:38:11,980 --> 01:38:13,250
What?
That makes no sense!

1762
01:38:13,250 --> 01:38:14,920
I thought he said he was
going out of town!

1763
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:16,620
<i>Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. happy.</i>

1764
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:18,290
Don't think he likes you,
by the way.

1765
01:38:18,290 --> 01:38:19,950
Sounded like he was
catching a flight.

1766
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:22,020
<i>Something about
taking off in nine minutes.</i>

1767
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:24,090
<i>What?</i>
He was surrounded by boxes.

1768
01:38:24,090 --> 01:38:25,290
Boxes? It's moving day.

1769
01:38:25,290 --> 01:38:27,560
It's moving day.
He's gonna rob that plane.

1770
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:31,030
I gotta stop him!

1771
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:34,170
All right, wheels up
in eight minutes.

1772
01:38:34,170 --> 01:38:37,100
We just got to load Tony's
old hulkbuster armor,

1773
01:38:37,110 --> 01:38:40,510
prototype for cap's new
shield, and the meging...

1774
01:38:40,510 --> 01:38:45,050
The Meg... the...
Thor's magic belt.

1775
01:38:45,110 --> 01:38:47,050
Okay, slow down.
You're getting close.

1776
01:38:47,050 --> 01:38:48,480
<i>It's on your right.</i>
What?

1777
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,480
<i>Turn right!
Turn right!</i>

1778
01:38:58,990 --> 01:39:01,360
Peter, are you okay?
Yeah.

1779
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:04,300
Just keep trying
to get through to happy.

1780
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:07,170
It's been an honor,
spider-man.

1781
01:39:07,170 --> 01:39:10,370
What are you doing here?
There's a dance.

1782
01:39:10,370 --> 01:39:12,410
Uh...

1783
01:39:13,270 --> 01:39:16,240
I'm looking

1784
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:19,310
at porn.

1785
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:58,090
Hey!

1786
01:39:59,390 --> 01:40:01,020
Surprised?

1787
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:02,420
Oh, hey, Pete.

1788
01:40:02,420 --> 01:40:04,620
I didn't hear you come in.

1789
01:40:04,630 --> 01:40:06,530
It's over.
I've got you.

1790
01:40:06,530 --> 01:40:09,030
You know,
i gotta tell you, Pete,

1791
01:40:09,030 --> 01:40:13,500
I really, really admire
your grit.

1792
01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:16,300
I see why Liz likes you.

1793
01:40:16,770 --> 01:40:19,470
I do. When you first
came to the house,

1794
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:21,740
I wasn't sure.
I thought, "really?"

1795
01:40:21,740 --> 01:40:22,680
But I get it now.

1796
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:24,610
How could you do this to her?

1797
01:40:24,610 --> 01:40:27,750
To her? I'm not doing
anything to her, Pete.

1798
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:30,450
I'm doing this for her.

1799
01:40:30,450 --> 01:40:32,790
Huh, yeah.

1800
01:40:35,660 --> 01:40:38,090
Peter,

1801
01:40:38,090 --> 01:40:39,030
you're young.

1802
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:41,600
You don't understand
how the world works.

1803
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,600
Yeah, but I understand

1804
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:44,300
that selling weapons
to criminals is wrong.

1805
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:47,270
How do you think your buddy
stark paid for that tower?

1806
01:40:47,270 --> 01:40:48,500
Or any of his little toys?

1807
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:50,270
Those people, Pete,
those people up there,

1808
01:40:50,270 --> 01:40:53,340
the rich and the powerful,
they do whatever they want.

1809
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:56,540
Guys like us, like you and me,

1810
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:58,380
they don't care about us.

1811
01:40:58,380 --> 01:41:01,180
We build their roads
and we fight all their wars

1812
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:03,780
and everything, but they
don't care about us.

1813
01:41:03,790 --> 01:41:05,320
We have to pick up after 'em.

1814
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:08,660
We have to eat
their table scraps.

1815
01:41:09,660 --> 01:41:11,160
That's how it is.

1816
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:13,830
I know you know what
I'm talking about, Peter.

1817
01:41:13,830 --> 01:41:15,800
Why are you telling me this?

1818
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:18,830
Because I want you
to understand.

1819
01:41:18,830 --> 01:41:19,770
And...

1820
01:41:19,770 --> 01:41:24,270
I needed a little time
to get her airborne.

1821
01:41:36,350 --> 01:41:38,850
I'm sorry, Peter.

1822
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:41,520
What are you talking about?

1823
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:44,790
That thing hasn't even
touched me yet.

1824
01:41:44,790 --> 01:41:46,790
True. Then again,

1825
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:49,860
wasn't really trying to.

1826
01:41:53,470 --> 01:41:55,840
<i>Chief, they're
powering up engines.</i>

1827
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:59,840
Okay. Yeah, yeah.
<i>Come on, come on, come on.</i>

1828
01:42:44,690 --> 01:42:48,160
Oh, god.

1829
01:42:51,190 --> 01:42:52,930
Okay, ready?

1830
01:43:01,870 --> 01:43:04,400
Hello!

1831
01:43:06,370 --> 01:43:07,570
Hello!

1832
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:09,210
Please. Hey.

1833
01:43:09,210 --> 01:43:12,180
Hey, please.
I'm down here.

1834
01:43:12,180 --> 01:43:13,750
I'm down here.
I'm stuck.

1835
01:43:13,750 --> 01:43:16,920
I'm stuck. I can't move.
I can't...

1836
01:43:32,700 --> 01:43:35,300
<i>If you're nothing
without this suit,</i>

1837
01:43:35,300 --> 01:43:38,510
<i>then you shouldn't have it.</i>

1838
01:43:43,580 --> 01:43:45,480
Come on, Peter.

1839
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:47,250
Come on, spider-man.

1840
01:43:47,250 --> 01:43:49,320
Come on,
spider-man.

1841
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:52,220
Come on, spider-man.

1842
01:43:53,490 --> 01:43:55,720
Come on, spider-man!

1843
01:44:45,740 --> 01:44:48,940
Launch for intercept.
Green light. Green light.

1844
01:44:48,940 --> 01:44:51,310
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1845
01:45:05,330 --> 01:45:08,800
Retroreflective panels engaged.

1846
01:45:18,610 --> 01:45:20,440
<i>Got a visual on the plane,</i>

1847
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:22,010
<i>but I'm feeling
a little resistance.</i>

1848
01:45:22,010 --> 01:45:25,510
<i>It's probably just drag
on the new turbines.</i>

1849
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,050
Ah!

1850
01:45:31,620 --> 01:45:33,820
Whoa!

1851
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:39,590
<i>Look out for
the cloaking cameras.</i>

1852
01:45:39,590 --> 01:45:42,030
<i>Stay in the blind spots.</i>

1853
01:45:50,810 --> 01:45:52,640
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

1854
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:55,610
Deploy high-altitude
vacuum seal.

1855
01:45:55,610 --> 01:45:58,780
<i>This better work, Mason.</i>

1856
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:04,480
<i>Trust me, boss,
even one of those boxes</i>

1857
01:46:04,490 --> 01:46:07,550
<i>and we are set for life.
Yeah.</i>

1858
01:46:16,660 --> 01:46:17,900
Hey! Ah! Whew.

1859
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:20,930
<i>You have 30 seconds
to get to the cockpit</i>

1860
01:46:20,940 --> 01:46:23,900
<i>and override their security.</i>

1861
01:46:33,950 --> 01:46:36,480
<i>Cloning transponder signal.</i>

1862
01:46:36,490 --> 01:46:38,150
Launching decoy drone.

1863
01:46:38,150 --> 01:46:41,420
Whoa.

1864
01:46:41,990 --> 01:46:45,390
<i>Entering new coordinates.</i>

1865
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:51,430
Good, so it's on its way?

1866
01:46:51,430 --> 01:46:55,640
Yes, sir, right on course.
Okay, thank you.

1867
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:57,570
All right.

1868
01:47:09,420 --> 01:47:11,850
Hot dog.

1869
01:48:00,030 --> 01:48:01,940
Just a typical homecoming

1870
01:48:01,940 --> 01:48:04,900
on the outside of
an invisible jet... ah!

1871
01:48:04,910 --> 01:48:07,510
Fighting my girlfriend's dad.

1872
01:48:07,510 --> 01:48:11,240
Oh! Oh! Ah!

1873
01:48:16,790 --> 01:48:19,720
Oh, god!

1874
01:48:24,730 --> 01:48:27,630
Whew. I can't believe
that worked.

1875
01:49:03,830 --> 01:49:06,530
Chief, they're losing altitude.
Get out of there.

1876
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:09,800
<i>I'm not going home
empty-handed.</i>

1877
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:20,780
Oh, my god.

1878
01:49:33,830 --> 01:49:36,200
<i>- Get out of there.
- What are you doing?</i>

1879
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:39,130
Please turn!
Please turn!

1880
01:51:12,690 --> 01:51:15,130
<i>Hey, Pedro.</i>

1881
01:52:01,740 --> 01:52:03,480
<i>Bingo.</i>

1882
01:52:18,490 --> 01:52:19,960
Your wingsuit.

1883
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:23,860
Your wingsuit's gonna explode!

1884
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:31,840
Time to go home, Pete.

1885
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:34,240
I'm trying to save you!

1886
01:52:44,090 --> 01:52:45,990
No!

1887
01:52:48,820 --> 01:52:50,960
No.

1888
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:53,030
No!

1889
01:53:02,540 --> 01:53:05,200
Ah! Ah!

1890
01:54:31,330 --> 01:54:33,630
It looked so insane.
That whole...

1891
01:54:33,630 --> 01:54:35,260
Like, it was just crazy.

1892
01:54:35,260 --> 01:54:37,530
He was just, like...

1893
01:54:37,530 --> 01:54:39,400
And you were
like, "ah!"

1894
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:42,030
And then I just hit him
with the "fffew."

1895
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:44,170
It was so...
Oh, my god.

1896
01:54:44,170 --> 01:54:46,470
You saved me.

1897
01:54:46,470 --> 01:54:49,110
It was awesome.

1898
01:54:54,250 --> 01:54:56,950
Hey, Liz.

1899
01:54:56,950 --> 01:54:59,050
I'm gonna miss you.

1900
01:54:59,050 --> 01:55:01,250
Bye.

1901
01:55:01,260 --> 01:55:03,390
Liz.

1902
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:10,960
Liz, look, I'm so sorry.

1903
01:55:10,970 --> 01:55:12,200
You say that a lot.

1904
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:14,970
What are you sorry
for this time?

1905
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,140
The dance?

1906
01:55:18,140 --> 01:55:21,010
That was a pretty crappy
thing to do.

1907
01:55:21,010 --> 01:55:23,180
Well, yeah, but i...
I mean, your dad...

1908
01:55:23,180 --> 01:55:25,180
I can't imagine what
you're going through.

1909
01:55:25,180 --> 01:55:27,250
If there's anything
i can do to help...

1910
01:55:27,250 --> 01:55:30,080
I guess we're moving to Oregon.

1911
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:34,050
Mom says it's nice there,
so that's cool.

1912
01:55:34,060 --> 01:55:37,260
Anyways, dad doesn't
want us here

1913
01:55:37,260 --> 01:55:40,030
during the trial, so...

1914
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:43,430
Liz, i... i...

1915
01:55:43,430 --> 01:55:45,030
Bye, Peter.

1916
01:55:45,030 --> 01:55:47,230
Whatever's going on with you,

1917
01:55:47,240 --> 01:55:50,170
I hope you figure it out.

1918
01:56:01,350 --> 01:56:06,120
Congratulations,
decathlon national champions.

1919
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:07,050
Yeah!

1920
01:56:07,060 --> 01:56:09,490
I'm gonna have to put this
back in the trophy case soon,

1921
01:56:09,490 --> 01:56:12,630
but just for motivation
right now at this practice.

1922
01:56:12,630 --> 01:56:14,160
I'm a little ahead of the game,

1923
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:16,400
but we will need a new
team captain next year.

1924
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:20,700
So I am appointing Michelle.

1925
01:56:20,700 --> 01:56:23,140
Yeah!

1926
01:56:24,470 --> 01:56:25,500
Uh, thank you.

1927
01:56:25,510 --> 01:56:26,740
My... my friends
call me mj.

1928
01:56:26,740 --> 01:56:30,210
I thought you didn't
have any friends.

1929
01:56:30,210 --> 01:56:32,610
I didn't.

1930
01:56:36,220 --> 01:56:39,620
I gotta go.
Hey, where you going?

1931
01:56:40,650 --> 01:56:44,490
What are you hiding, Peter?

1932
01:56:45,390 --> 01:56:47,190
I'm just kidding.
I don't care. Bye.

1933
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:49,600
All right, so we should
run some drills.

1934
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:52,230
Yeah.

1935
01:56:57,740 --> 01:57:02,340
Hey, happy. What...
What are you doing here?

1936
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:05,240
I really owe you one.

1937
01:57:05,750 --> 01:57:08,380
I don't know what I would
do without this job.

1938
01:57:08,380 --> 01:57:10,550
I mean, before I met Tony...

1939
01:57:40,310 --> 01:57:42,150
So how long you been here?

1940
01:57:42,150 --> 01:57:44,720
Long enough to be awkward.
Boss wants to see you.

1941
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:46,520
Is he here too?

1942
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:48,450
In the toilet?
No, he's upstate.

1943
01:57:48,460 --> 01:57:51,090
Upstate?
Like, upstate-upstate?

1944
01:57:51,090 --> 01:57:53,360
Yeah, let's go.

1945
01:57:53,590 --> 01:57:54,760
Take a look.

1946
01:57:54,760 --> 01:57:57,500
It's pretty impressive, huh?

1947
01:57:57,500 --> 01:58:01,300
They just finished
remodeling the whole thing.

1948
01:58:26,290 --> 01:58:30,630
You don't see that every day.
Oh, there they are.

1949
01:58:30,630 --> 01:58:33,270
How was the ride up?
Good.

1950
01:58:33,270 --> 01:58:36,340
Give me a minute with the kid.

1951
01:58:36,340 --> 01:58:38,400
Seriously?
Yeah.

1952
01:58:38,410 --> 01:58:40,210
I got to talk to the kid.

1953
01:58:40,210 --> 01:58:41,510
I'll be close behind.

1954
01:58:41,510 --> 01:58:42,840
How about a loose follow?

1955
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:46,480
All right?
Boundaries are good.

1956
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:51,680
Sorry I took your suit.

1957
01:58:51,690 --> 01:58:53,150
I mean, you had it coming.

1958
01:58:53,150 --> 01:58:54,690
Actually, it turns
out it was the perfect

1959
01:58:54,690 --> 01:58:56,660
tough-love moment
that you needed, right?

1960
01:58:56,660 --> 01:58:58,460
To urge you on?
Wouldn't you think?

1961
01:58:58,460 --> 01:59:00,130
Don't you think?
I guess.

1962
01:59:00,130 --> 01:59:01,530
Let's just say it was.

1963
01:59:01,530 --> 01:59:04,130
Mr. stark, I really...

1964
01:59:04,130 --> 01:59:06,470
You screwed the pooch hard,
bigtime.

1965
01:59:06,470 --> 01:59:08,600
But then you did
the right thing.

1966
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:10,370
Took the dog to the free clinic,

1967
01:59:10,370 --> 01:59:12,370
you raised the hybrid puppies.

1968
01:59:12,370 --> 01:59:15,470
All right, not my best analogy.

1969
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:17,640
I was wrong about you.

1970
01:59:17,650 --> 01:59:19,850
I think, with a little
more mentoring,

1971
01:59:19,850 --> 01:59:22,750
you could be a real asset
to the team.

1972
01:59:24,150 --> 01:59:25,750
To the... to the team?
Yeah. Anyway,

1973
01:59:25,750 --> 01:59:28,250
there's about 50 reporters
behind that door.

1974
01:59:28,260 --> 01:59:30,160
Real ones, not bloggers.

1975
01:59:30,160 --> 01:59:32,190
When you're ready,

1976
01:59:32,190 --> 01:59:34,190
why don't you try that on?

1977
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:35,660
And I'll introduce the world

1978
01:59:35,660 --> 01:59:38,560
to the newest official
member of the avengers:

1979
01:59:38,570 --> 01:59:40,770
Spider-man.

1980
01:59:42,470 --> 01:59:43,670
I... heh.

1981
01:59:45,670 --> 01:59:48,740
Yeah, give that a look.

1982
01:59:53,310 --> 01:59:54,580
So after the press conference,

1983
01:59:54,580 --> 01:59:56,950
happy will show you
to your room, your new quarters.

1984
01:59:56,950 --> 01:59:59,420
Where's he between?
He's next to vision?

1985
01:59:59,420 --> 02:00:01,250
Yeah, vision's not big on doors.

1986
02:00:01,260 --> 02:00:03,460
It's fun.
Or walls.

1987
02:00:03,460 --> 02:00:05,860
You'll fit right in.

1988
02:00:11,460 --> 02:00:14,270
Thank you, Mr. stark,

1989
02:00:14,270 --> 02:00:15,430
but I'm... I'm good.

1990
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:18,400
You're good?
How are you good?

1991
02:00:18,410 --> 02:00:21,570
Well, I mean,
I'd rather just stay

1992
02:00:21,580 --> 02:00:22,980
on the ground
for a little while.

1993
02:00:22,980 --> 02:00:25,210
Friendly neighborhood
spider-man.

1994
02:00:25,210 --> 02:00:27,880
Somebody's got to look out
for the little guy, right?

1995
02:00:27,880 --> 02:00:29,520
You're turning me down?

1996
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:32,320
You better think about this.
Look at that.

1997
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:33,450
Look at me.

1998
02:00:33,450 --> 02:00:35,620
Last chance.
Yes or no?

1999
02:00:35,620 --> 02:00:36,760
No.
Okay.

2000
02:00:36,760 --> 02:00:37,990
It's kind of
a Springsteen-y,

2001
02:00:37,990 --> 02:00:39,930
working-class hero
vibe that I dig.

2002
02:00:39,930 --> 02:00:42,460
Ah, happy will take you home.

2003
02:00:42,460 --> 02:00:43,660
Yeah?
Yeah.

2004
02:00:43,660 --> 02:00:47,500
Mind waiting in the car?
I need a minute.

2005
02:00:47,830 --> 02:00:48,900
Thank you, Mr. stark.

2006
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:50,700
Yes, Mr. Parker,
very well.

2007
02:00:50,710 --> 02:00:53,640
See you around.
Okay.

2008
02:01:00,650 --> 02:01:01,980
That was a test, right?

2009
02:01:01,980 --> 02:01:04,520
There's nobody back there?

2010
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:05,650
Yes, you passed.

2011
02:01:05,650 --> 02:01:07,790
All right, skedaddle there,
young buck.

2012
02:01:07,790 --> 02:01:09,660
Thank you, Mr. stark.
Thank you.

2013
02:01:09,660 --> 02:01:11,820
Yeah, thank you.

2014
02:01:12,730 --> 02:01:15,860
Told you he was a good kid.

2015
02:01:17,700 --> 02:01:20,970
Pepper! Pepper!

2016
02:01:20,970 --> 02:01:21,930
Where's the kid?

2017
02:01:21,940 --> 02:01:23,370
He left.
Everybody's waiting.

2018
02:01:23,370 --> 02:01:25,440
He actually made
a really mature choice.

2019
02:01:25,440 --> 02:01:27,340
It just surprised
the heck out of us.

2020
02:01:27,340 --> 02:01:28,540
Did you guys screw this up?

2021
02:01:28,540 --> 02:01:29,980
He told the kid
to wait in the car.

2022
02:01:29,980 --> 02:01:32,610
Are you kidding me? I have
a room full of people waiting

2023
02:01:32,610 --> 02:01:35,310
for some big announcement.
What am I gonna tell them?

2024
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:37,980
Think of something.
How about, um,

2025
02:01:37,990 --> 02:01:40,390
hap, you still got that ring?

2026
02:01:40,390 --> 02:01:40,990
Do i... i...

2027
02:01:40,990 --> 02:01:42,550
The engagement ring.
Are you kidding?

2028
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:46,490
I've been carrying
this since 2008.

2029
02:01:48,060 --> 02:01:48,860
Okay.

2030
02:01:48,860 --> 02:01:50,930
I think I can think of
something better than that.

2031
02:01:50,930 --> 02:01:54,370
Well, it would buy us
a little time.

2032
02:01:54,970 --> 02:01:56,340
Like we need time.

2033
02:01:56,340 --> 02:01:58,640
I can't believe you have
that thing in your pocket.

2034
02:01:58,640 --> 02:02:00,340
Let me to get the door
for you, hon?

2035
02:02:00,340 --> 02:02:03,480
I got it.

2036
02:02:16,890 --> 02:02:21,030
Aunt may,
did you do dinner already?

2037
02:02:30,700 --> 02:02:32,840
May?

2038
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:54,490
What the f...?!

2039
02:05:08,930 --> 02:05:11,900
Look who it is.

2040
02:05:12,270 --> 02:05:14,270
What are the odds
you and I'd end up

2041
02:05:14,270 --> 02:05:16,700
at the same summer camp?

2042
02:05:16,700 --> 02:05:17,670
Relax.

2043
02:05:17,670 --> 02:05:19,840
This?
It's not on you.

2044
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:23,180
It's on our
little spider friend.

2045
02:05:23,180 --> 02:05:25,140
I've got some boys
on the outside

2046
02:05:25,150 --> 02:05:27,080
who would love to meet him.

2047
02:05:27,080 --> 02:05:28,280
You know, take a picture,

2048
02:05:28,280 --> 02:05:30,950
slice his throat,
put his head in a dryer.

2049
02:05:30,950 --> 02:05:34,590
And I heard a rumor...

2050
02:05:36,660 --> 02:05:39,260
You know who he is.

2051
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:44,530
If I knew who he was,

2052
02:05:44,530 --> 02:05:47,130
he'd already be dead.

2053
02:05:50,270 --> 02:05:54,670
Toomes, your family's here!

2054
02:12:32,270 --> 02:12:35,510
Hi, I'm captain America,
here to talk to you

2055
02:12:35,510 --> 02:12:37,280
about one of the most
valuable traits

2056
02:12:37,280 --> 02:12:40,180
a soldier or student can have.

2057
02:12:40,180 --> 02:12:41,250
Patience.

2058
02:12:41,250 --> 02:12:43,680
Sometimes Patience
is the key to victory.

2059
02:12:43,680 --> 02:12:45,620
Sometimes it leads
to very little

2060
02:12:45,620 --> 02:12:48,420
and it seems like
it's not worth it.

2061
02:12:48,420 --> 02:12:50,290
And you wonder

2062
02:12:50,290 --> 02:12:51,460
why you waited so long

2063
02:12:51,460 --> 02:12:55,060
for something so disappointing.

2064
02:12:58,030 --> 02:13:01,000
How many more of these?
