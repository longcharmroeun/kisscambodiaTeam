[woman] You think he's hard on you
because we're not from here?

I doubt he gives a shit where we're from.

Don't like having an extro for a manager.

Fletcher, have you made friends
with any local kids?

10
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:06,333
Yeah. Been hanging out with a few of them.

11
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:09,666
Talk kind of strange.
But other than that, they seem cool.

- What about Sedgewick?

- Has he made any friends?
- [Fletcher] I, um...

- [father] Right. Of course, he hasn't.

Fletcher, can you keep an eye
on him for me?

16
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,708
- You know how he is.
- [father] He needs to learn to adapt.

It's about character or lack of it.

21
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:38,541
- No amount of modding would fix that.
- [mother] Not his fault.

No, I just don't...

But don't worry about me.
I can take care of myself.
