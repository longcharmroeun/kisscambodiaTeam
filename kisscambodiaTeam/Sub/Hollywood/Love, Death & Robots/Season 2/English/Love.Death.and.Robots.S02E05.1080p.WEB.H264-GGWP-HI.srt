- Please get back on board, sir.

00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,291
- What happened?
- Just a brief stop.

14
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:26,000
Now, please, sir, return to your cabin.

15
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:29,875
- Is something wrong with the engine?
- Nothing of consequence.

16
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:33,458
The boiler. Just need to build up
another head of steam.

17
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,416
Then, surely, I have time for a smoke.

18
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,916
Yes, but... don't wander.

19
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:45,291
Once we're ready to go, I'll call for you
to get on board, but only twice.

They... They don't like fire.

Near as I can tell,
most of them used to be people.

Maybe some got lost crossing the plains.

Or maybe others got off the train
at the wrong place.

The train loses steam always at this spot.

And then it's like
a kind of door opens up out there.
