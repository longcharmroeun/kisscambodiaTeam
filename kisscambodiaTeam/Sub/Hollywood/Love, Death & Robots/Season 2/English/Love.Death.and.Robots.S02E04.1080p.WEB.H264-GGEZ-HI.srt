Hey, Snow, it's... it's good to see you.

6
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,375
Did they come in?

7
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:38,958
Oh, uh, it's getting harder and harder
to bring the real stuff in from Earth.

8
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,250
It's getting expensive.

9
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,500
Maybe I could interest you
in some synthetic analogs.

10
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:48,250
[Snow] Maybe you should
shut the fuck up and give me my stuff.

11
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,750
Order another two kilos.
I'll be back in a month.

[indistinct chattering]

13
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:15,875
[Snow] Thanks.

14
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,041
You're Snow, the albino.

15
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,583
- No, I'm not.
- Now, don't fuck with me.

16
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,250
I'm not fucking with you.

17
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:37,250
My name is Jelda Conley.
They call me Whitey.

18
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,541
Bounty hunters, right?

19
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:43,291
What's he done, this... Snow guy?

20
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:46,791
No, it's not me wants him.
It's the merchant, Baris.

21
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,791
There's a big reward for his balls.

22
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,583
Balls? As in, testicles?

23
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:56,416
[chuckles]

24
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,833
- Now, why the hell would Baris want those?
- My job ends at the taking.

25
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:05,083
Now, whether you're him or not...

26
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,000
I challenge you.

27
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:09,458
Listen...

28
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:14,291
I've never killed anyone who didn't try
to kill me first, so just move on.

29
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,250
I said I challenge you!

30
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,291
Everyone here heard it!

31
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,458
That puts me within my rights.

32
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,958
So stand up.

Unless harm is meant.

36
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,041
Best I get gone.

00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,666
Well, thanks for the help.

Oh.

39
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,583
Found him. Get the team together.

43
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,541
Sorry.

44
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,416
- Not used to company.
- That's okay. I'm not hungry.

45
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,000
But I wanna travel with you.

46
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,291
My name is Hirald.

47
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,500
I'm crossing the Thiran plain.
It's not easy.

48
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,250
I have no problem with that.

49
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll think about it.

50
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,541
Don't you have a day tent?

51
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,375
You can share mine.

52
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,333
[cawing]

53
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:50,250
Not much... but it'll protect us
from the worst of the heat.

54
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,041
Always been a fast healer.

55
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:12,666
Uh...

56
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,291
[Snow]
You should know why Baris is after me.

57
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,791
Why he wants my...

58
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,083
Testicles, yes.

59
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:54,208
There's something unique
about the gonadotropin-releasing hormone

60
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,458
your body produces.

61
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,833
Your cells are regenerative.

62
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,875
And hence, immortal.

63
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,083
Your hand will grow back in...

64
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,041
a week?

65
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,375
[Snow] Maybe less.

66
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,791
I work for Earth Central Intelligence.

67
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:19,083
They want the same things as Baris,
but I'm no bounty hunter.

68
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,083
- They wish you to come willingly.
- Why?

69
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,958
Because whoever decodes
your reproductive system

70
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:29,041
controls, in effect, immortality.

71
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:33,541
This knowledge could destabilize
the entire Protectorate.

72
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,208
Why not just kill me? Problem solved.

73
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,833
Earth Central does not suppress knowledge.

74
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:43,625
Morality's a human construct.
I thought AIs didn't give a shit.

75
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,416
They were created
to protect the greater good.

76
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,333
Will you come?

77
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:55,000
Two days should bring us to my home.
We should keep moving.

78
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:06,958
Here.

Make yourself comfortable.

00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,500
You'll find clothes
in the back and a shower.

86
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,125
There's plenty of water here.

My wife's.

She killed herself 123 years ago.

Why?

00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,500
She grew old.

You've been alive for centuries.

And yet you choose to live here,
on this backwater shithole of a planet.
