Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to answer me.

Ma'am, please pay attention.

8

The more you withhold information,
the harder this gets for you.

Ma'am!

00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:12,750
Do the landlords know you're living here?

12
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,541
- Tell us who else is helping you.
- [Ruth] Please.

[Mantus] Are there any more

That's all of them.

21
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:35,375
They were all inside
when we breached the door.

22
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:38,958
Hell, I don't even think these kids
have ever seen outside.

23
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:42,083
See this?

00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,750
They made a bassinet out of a drawer.

- Got them.

- [Briggs] Good.
- [Pentle] Mm-hm.

28
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,833
All right then. Go ahead, take them in.

29
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,750

I wouldn't miss this.

53

Was it a bad one?

- Mm.

56
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:17,500
Just breeders, not armed or anything.
It was... easy.

57
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,583
Well, I can't imagine stopping
the rejoo treatments just like that.

58
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,375
I mean, why give all this up?

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,208
I've just spent 20 years
perfecting that solo.

of Telogo's infamous solo

that made our performance resonate
so strongly with the critics.

Oh, yes, right now.

Didn't know how to make it calm down.
Well, that's when the neighbors heard.

Thought it was a dog at first.

think would happen?

168
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,833
You're smiling.

169
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,208
She's cute.

170
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,583
You feel something, don't you?

171
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,000
You've got to know
this can't possibly work.

172
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:26,583
I've been alive 218 years.

173
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,666
I've seen... too much.

174
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,625
But she makes everything new.

175
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,958
I love seeing things
through her little eyes.

[gibbering]

177

They're so bright.
They're so full of life.

178
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:43,666
Not dead.

179
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,666
Like yours.

[Melanie gibbering]

I remember her first steps.

182
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,791
I remember her first laugh.

183
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,875
I remember the first time
she called me Mommy.

184
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:08,458
I remember all these moments
because I know I won't have many.

She wants to put it on your head.
It's a game she plays.

No! No, no.

No, please. Please, she's just a child.

195
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,583
Please don't, she's just a child.
Please. Don't shoot her.

196
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,750
Take me. Shoot me instead.

197
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,833
I'll make room. Do it. Do it!

198
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,500
Kill me instead. I'll make room.
