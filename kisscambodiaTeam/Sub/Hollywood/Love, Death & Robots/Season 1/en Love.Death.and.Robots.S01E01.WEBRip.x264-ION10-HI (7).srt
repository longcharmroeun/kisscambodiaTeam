is a simulation being fed to you.

162
00:11:36,671 --> 00:11:38,051
No. Stop that!

163
00:11:39,838 --> 00:11:41,878
The whole truth. <i>Now.</i>

164
00:11:43,046 --> 00:11:45,416
Some of what I told you <i>is </i>true.

165
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,841
You did end up here via a routing error.

166
00:11:48,588 --> 00:11:52,128
You are beyond the Aquila Rift,
thousands of light years from Earth,

167
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:55,883
and there is a station here. It's just...

168
00:11:56,296 --> 00:11:57,376
different.

169
00:11:58,213 --> 00:12:02,763
So, who is feeding me this fake reality,
this fake Greta?

170
00:12:02,838 --> 00:12:03,838
I am.

171
00:12:04,755 --> 00:12:08,255
And just who... or what... are you?

172
00:12:08,963 --> 00:12:10,643
I don't think you're ready for the answer.

173
00:12:10,671 --> 00:12:11,841
Let me be the judge of that.

174
00:12:13,005 --> 00:12:15,915
You don't know how many lost souls
I've been through this with.

175
00:12:17,505 --> 00:12:19,255
I don't want to hurt you, Thom.

176
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:22,758
I just need to know what's going on here.
I need to see.

177
00:12:22,838 --> 00:12:26,878
I need to see this place.
I need to see you as you really are.

178
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:28,513
[tearfully] You're not ready.

179

- Trust me...
- [shouts] Show me, God damn it!

180
00:12:38,755 --> 00:12:39,955
All right, Thom.

181
00:12:43,755 --> 00:12:45,045
But understand this:

182
00:12:47,255 --> 00:12:49,295
I do care for you.

183
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:54,211
I care for all the lost souls
that end up here.

Hello, Thom.

Greta?

195
00:14:21,005 --> 00:14:22,335
Is that really you?

It's good to see you, Thom.

What happened?

You're in Saumlaki Station,
Schedar Sector.

Schedar Sector? But...

that's hundreds of light years
off our course.

[Greta] Yes, it is.

there's a friendly face here.
