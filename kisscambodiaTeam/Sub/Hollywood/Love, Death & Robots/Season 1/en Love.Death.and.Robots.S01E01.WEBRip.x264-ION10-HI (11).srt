Appreciate the company, Bill.

5
00:01:09,255 --> 00:01:12,205
These solo jobs tweak my nerves.

6
00:01:12,296 --> 00:01:14,756
[Bill] <i>God damn company penny pinchers,</i>
<i>am I right?</i>

7
00:01:14,838 --> 00:01:16,548
Why pay two when one'll do?

8
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,090
Prepping EVA.

Damn it!

<i>Alex, what the hell's going on out there?</i>

26
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:10,628
I'm fucked. Impact on my mobility unit.

27
00:03:10,713 --> 00:03:13,463
It went non-functional
and the backup's damaged as well.

[rapid beeping]

[rapid beeping]

34
00:03:30,963 --> 00:03:32,053
Listen, Bill.

35
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,461
That impact...

36
00:03:35,755 --> 00:03:38,295
Well, it looks like it damaged
my oxygen tanks too.

37
00:03:40,671 --> 00:03:42,511
The rescue team's
not gonna make it in time.

Math's come in. I'm done.

40
00:03:51,505 --> 00:03:53,125
Just do me a favor, okay?

41
00:03:53,796 --> 00:03:57,296
Next time the suits come calling, would
you kick them in the bollocks for me?

Wait.

[Bill] <i>Jesus, Alex. Thank God.</i>

<i>What happened?</i>

76
00:08:00,338 --> 00:08:03,128
I had to make a wee sacrifice
to the great nothing.

77
00:08:05,213 --> 00:08:06,673
But I'm still breathing.

78

81
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:16,706
Funny you should ask...

82
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:20,668
but I got things under control.

83
00:08:23,255 --> 00:08:25,255
Just get a few beers chillin', Bill.
