[man] The assholes wouldn't leave.

00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:42,840
I had to call the goddamn Sheriff to cart
them and their scrawny fucktard kids away.

00:00:43,296 --> 00:00:45,756
Ah, crap! Goddammit.

00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,460
What a shit hole.

8
00:00:57,296 --> 00:01:01,756
Listen, I gotta go.
Another day, another eviction.

[narrator] <i>This dump's my home.</i>

<i>Some people may not think much of it.</i>

12
00:01:14,505 --> 00:01:18,005
<i>But me and my buddy Otto
like it here just fine.</i>

[grunts]

00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,420
I've been habitating here
more than 20-odd years now.

22
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:06,170
And some new high-falutin' sanitation law
don't mean shit to me, Mr. City Inspector.

00:02:06,713 --> 00:02:09,263
Oh, but I'm afraid it <i>does </i>mean something

00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,838
to the owners of the condominiums
they're building next door.

25
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:14,761
So, you see,
everything in this dump has got to go,

26
00:02:14,838 --> 00:02:16,668
including you, Mr. Dvorchack.

Always scrounging for food.

while I spin ya a little yarn?

33
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,375
And you still want Otto
and me gone when I'm done,

34
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:41,593
well, I'll sign whatever you want
and we clear on out.

- Dang lighter!
- I'm a busy man, Mr. Dvorchack.

36

I don't have time for drunken ramblings
and crazy stories.

37
00:02:49,505 --> 00:02:51,045
If we could just move this...

38
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,460
- One night, couple years back...
- Fuck me.

Oh, yeah? What about women?

48
00:03:21,838 --> 00:03:23,958
I don't see no women round here.

Pearly, she's right there.

50

Oh, sorry. No offense, Betty.

But I am telling you, boy.

It's just rats. Tell me about the whores.

So, you were saying about Curly?
