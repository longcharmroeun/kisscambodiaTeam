- What the fuck was that, Doctor?
- I think you know.

00:00:50,755 --> 00:00:53,085
I wanna hear <i>you </i>fuckin' say it,

Tell me, Doctor,
is that as fast as you can run?

00:01:02,088 --> 00:01:03,548
I'm afraid so, Mr. Flynn.

12
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,880
Good, it'll catch you first

[Mr. Flynn] Is that what
we're looking for, Doctor?

21
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,210
I think it might be, Mr. Flynn.

feeding on them makes his flesh burn.

Cut the shit, Gary.

There's a fucking monster out there,

Stop with all the yodeling

Because that <i>thing </i>is between us

It is the Impaler.

Isn't that a type of car?

131
00:07:50,755 --> 00:07:53,005
That's an Impala, you stupid cunt.

Oh, right.

133
00:07:54,463 --> 00:07:57,343
So there's a Dracula out there, then?

Not particularly tickity, to be honest.

141
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,630
Weren't expecting gunfights
with angry vampires.

142
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:21,673
We've got two boxes of ammo for the P90s,

and I've got a smidge of C4, if it helps.

145
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:31,955
Why? Why do you have C4, Gary?

- What?
- I said, it's not enough.

You're not dealing with
Taliban terrorists here.

You're dealing with an ancient evil
that defeats whole armies

00:08:46,921 --> 00:08:48,961
and feasts on their entrails.

152

- Oh, come on!

00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:02,803
You got suggestions, Doctor,
now's the time to make 'em.

I'm an archaeologist,
Mr. Flynn, not a tactician.

00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,628
Well, I'm an ex-soldier,
not Buffy the fucking Vampire Slayer,

159
00:09:09,713 --> 00:09:11,383
but you don't see me crying in a corner.

[frantic music plays]

This place was built to withstand siege.

There must be other exits.

164
00:09:21,463 --> 00:09:23,053
I think I may have something.

165
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,380
The map marked another egress point.

166
00:09:30,546 --> 00:09:32,416
Secret door! Beautiful.

167
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,585
[loud pounding]

168
00:09:35,463 --> 00:09:37,093
[Gary] Hey, boss?

169
00:09:37,963 --> 00:09:39,013
Yes, Gary?

170
00:09:39,088 --> 00:09:42,208
- About that C4...
- Do it.

171
00:09:42,296 --> 00:09:43,126
[laughs]

172
00:09:43,213 --> 00:09:45,647
[Mr. Flynn] Just don't bring
the whole damn castle down on us.

173
00:09:45,671 --> 00:09:47,961
- [Gary laughs]
- [Mr. Flynn] Oh, shit.

174
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:49,796
[laughing]

175
00:09:49,838 --> 00:09:50,856
- [loud pounding]
- [gasps]

176
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,880
[roaring]

177
00:09:56,713 --> 00:09:57,763
[roars]

178
00:09:58,588 --> 00:09:59,588
[Mr. Flynn] Fire!

179
00:10:12,213 --> 00:10:14,053
- [pained howls]
- [Gary laughs]

180
00:10:15,505 --> 00:10:17,265
- [gun clicking]
- [shouting] Door shut, now!

181
00:10:21,005 --> 00:10:22,085
[roars]

182
00:10:26,088 --> 00:10:32,168
[speaking Romanian]

183
00:10:32,255 --> 00:10:34,255
[rapid beeping]

184
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,340
[Mr. Flynn laughs]
Sounds like he found our little gift.

185
00:10:46,963 --> 00:10:48,173
[Gary] Shit, sorry!

186
00:10:48,255 --> 00:10:50,255
[frantic music plays]

187
00:10:57,463 --> 00:10:59,133
[debris tumbling]

188
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:03,011
[coughing]

189
00:11:04,255 --> 00:11:05,835
Every time, Gary!

190
00:11:06,088 --> 00:11:08,758
What? Better too much than too little.

191
00:11:09,255 --> 00:11:10,335
[Mr. Flynn grunts]

192
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,046
Where did you say this tunnel led to?

193
00:11:14,296 --> 00:11:15,666
More prison cells.

194
00:11:16,046 --> 00:11:17,916
Probably cells for more...

195
00:11:18,505 --> 00:11:19,505
[cat growls]

196
00:11:19,588 --> 00:11:21,418
[menacing music plays]

197
00:11:21,546 --> 00:11:23,546
[low growling]

198
00:11:26,005 --> 00:11:28,165
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

199
00:11:34,421 --> 00:11:35,591
[roars]
