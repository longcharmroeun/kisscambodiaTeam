00:00:59,296 --> 00:01:03,376
I swear to God, we are going at it
like fucking animals, bro.

[grunts repeatedly]

6
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:08,591
I don't even have a sister.

7
00:01:09,088 --> 00:01:11,798
Then why do you get so mad
when I dream about fucking her?

8
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:14,461

Well, if he could hit a target that tiny,</i>

22
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,670

You can't sit here.

25
00:02:27,755 --> 00:02:29,505
I don't see any reserved signs.

26
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,130
I said, <i>you </i>can't sit here.

27
00:02:36,338 --> 00:02:40,168
The corps turned to shit when they started
lettin' you animals wear the uniform.

28
00:02:40,713 --> 00:02:44,963
Look, my buddy took a bullet
for you guys today so... back off.

29
00:02:45,046 --> 00:02:50,546
Yeah, see, and I don't trust anything
that bleeds that much and then walks away.

30
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,375
- Unnatural is what you are.
- Unnatural?

31
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:57,585
I can stalk my prey by scent alone.

32
00:02:58,338 --> 00:03:01,958
I can run for miles while you need
to ride in a stinking Humvee all day.

33
00:03:02,046 --> 00:03:04,796
I can see clearly on a moonless night,

34
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,510
while you cling to your flashlight
as soon as the sun goes down.

35
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:10,128
You ask me,
there's not much natural in that.

36
00:03:11,796 --> 00:03:13,666
You fuckin' dog soldiers.

No disrespect, Sergeant...

39
00:03:18,713 --> 00:03:20,713
but if you call us dog soldiers again...

40
00:03:21,796 --> 00:03:24,166
I'll rip your arm off
and beat you to death with it.

41
00:03:27,546 --> 00:03:28,796
You wanna try it?

[growls]

43
00:03:42,838 --> 00:03:43,838
Come on.

44
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:46,093
Smells like dog shit in here.

[rock music plays]

46
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,170
You know what I think it is?

47
00:03:56,588 --> 00:03:57,668
Jealousy.

48
00:03:58,463 --> 00:03:59,673
Mm-hmm.

49
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:03,456
Those guys know that
if the brass cut us loose,

50
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:06,335
we'd have this shit cleaned up
in three weeks.

51
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:08,131
I think it's more complicated than that.

52
00:04:08,421 --> 00:04:11,011
No, you're right.
They're fuckin' terrified of us, too.

[chuckles]

54

Claws and blood, baby.

55
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:16,128
They don't understand us
any more than they do this fucking war,

56
00:04:16,213 --> 00:04:18,093
which is why we don't belong here.

57
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:25,881
Look, I don't like every asshole
that calls himself an American,

58
00:04:26,755 --> 00:04:28,795
but it's still my fuckin' country.

[mimics drill sergeant]
Do you hear me, Cadet?

61
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,960
Stand up straight!

62
00:04:37,046 --> 00:04:41,206
We are here for duty, honor and country,
Momma and apple pie.

63
00:04:41,296 --> 00:04:43,956
I'm just here to make sure
you don't get your dumb ass killed.

64
00:04:44,046 --> 00:04:44,876
Your dumb ass.

65
00:04:44,963 --> 00:04:48,593
I think you're both here
because dogs gotta hunt.

66
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:50,461
- Sir!
- At ease.

67
00:04:50,713 --> 00:04:53,133
We're rotating squads at
the forward operating base.

68
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,590
Sobieski, you're with the outgoing squad.

69
00:05:06,046 --> 00:05:08,706
Try not to piss off any of the regulars
while you're up there.

70

[scoffs] If they're smart,
they'll be trying hard not to piss <i>me </i>off.

- Is that right, tough guy?
- Uh-huh.

Now, remember, honey,

[tearfully] if you need anything,

74
00:05:17,255 --> 00:05:20,455

- You're so full of shit.

75
00:05:20,546 --> 00:05:22,166
- And you're an idiot.

Fire Team leader,
make sure your team is up.

81

- [man] Yes, sir.
- [Decker] What's the situation?

82
00:05:56,213 --> 00:05:57,053
Fuck if I know.

83
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,710
Call came in about intruders
inside the fire base perimeter,

84
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:01,005
then comms went down.

85

- So the Major's sending us in.
- I'm going up there.

- Like hell you are.
- I can get to that fire base in minutes.

It'll take this relief column an hour.

88

Dog soldier's worried about his own kind.

Fuck off! Those are men up there.
Doesn't matter what kind.

- Go.

Torn to shreds.

How the fuck did it get past your pal?

101
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:41,008
He took out Sobieski first, sir,
then moved on to the others.

00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:46,303
What use are you people
if you can't even sniff out your own kind?

103
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,960
I've got his scent now.

104
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,210
I can track him.

105

You gettin' anything?

110
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,170
Nothing. He isn't here.

111
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,920
[Commander] Shit.

112

You're a fucking animal.
