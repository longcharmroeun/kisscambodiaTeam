Stay sharp, metalheads.

Copy that! Countdown to mayhem.

00:00:50,755 --> 00:00:52,875
- We gonna let Rookie in on this?
- Depends.

00:00:52,963 --> 00:00:56,263
- Hey, Rookie, your balls dropped yet?
- What?

7
00:00:56,338 --> 00:00:58,258
Fuck you, Sui. I'm ready.

8
00:00:58,338 --> 00:01:01,798
You'll get your chance, boy, don't worry.
We on schedule, Bob?

9
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,641
[Bob the Robot] Affirmative.
It appears the cargo is in the front car.

10
00:01:04,671 --> 00:01:06,841
Hey, Hawk, what are we stealing, anyway?

11
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:08,341
It's a microchip, kid.

12
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:10,941
[Hawk] <i>Wanna know what that</i>

00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:13,375
[Bob] Don't forget
to look out for guards in the rear car.

[thumping electronic music plays]

[Hawk] Contact.
Move up and match velocity.

16
00:01:21,005 --> 00:01:21,875
In position.

17
00:01:21,963 --> 00:01:23,343
I got a position for you.

18
00:01:23,421 --> 00:01:26,341
Really? Does it involve shoving my gun

19
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:29,301

- [Hawk] <i>We good to go, Bob?</i> - [Bob] Roger that.

20
00:01:30,088 --> 00:01:31,548
The target is in the blind spot.

21
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,106
You got till it reaches
the other side of the tunnel to get in,

22
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,050
- make the grab and get out.
- Move out.

23
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:41,335
Sui, Rookie, plant the magnetic mines
on the guard car.

24
00:01:41,421 --> 00:01:43,171
[sarcastically] Great idea, boss.

25
00:01:43,255 --> 00:01:46,335
Give the high explosives to the lunatic
and the new guy.

26
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:47,841
What could go wrong?

Ah, shut your grease trap. I got this.

- Hate to say I told you so.

34
00:02:22,338 --> 00:02:23,918
Give us some covering fire, Kali.

35

On the roof!

That does it.

[Kali] Wait! Just blow the mines...
- [roars] -...you suicidal fuck.

38
00:02:40,338 --> 00:02:43,508
We're almost at the tunnel.
We need to blow those mines now!

Sui's not... clear.

40
00:02:45,713 --> 00:02:46,883
[Sui] Don't worry about me.

41
00:02:48,088 --> 00:02:49,088
Do it, Hawk!

No, Bob, you didn't.

Okay, let's pick it up.

50
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:28,511
If this truck makes it through
that tunnel, we are all fucked.

[Sui] Rookie, get your lug-nuts up here.

52
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:36,013
[Bob] Uh, wait a second.
I'm getting a new energy reading.

53

Oh, shit.

54
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:41,591
Uh, fellas? I think Bob missed
another detail about the defenses.

55
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:43,795
What do you mean, Kali? I don't...

Holy fucking shit!

Ohh.

[Bob] It's too heavily armored.

69
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:44,255
You'll have to get inside
and take out the defense CPU.

70
00:04:45,046 --> 00:04:46,916
Rookie, blow its brains out.

Destroy this fucker's CPU.

Bob always makes a full backup of
our brains before each mission.

And Sui's brains, well, they don't take
too much space on the old hard drive.
