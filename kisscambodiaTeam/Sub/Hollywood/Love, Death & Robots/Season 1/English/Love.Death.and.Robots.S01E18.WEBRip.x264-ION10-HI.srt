00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,005
[boards creaking]

00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,710
[whistles loudly]

4
00:01:57,296 --> 00:01:58,956
[man yells] Malenchenko!

5
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,261
[man yells] Hey, I need help here.

6
00:02:12,338 --> 00:02:14,338
[man 2] This area smells like shit.

7
00:02:18,546 --> 00:02:19,666
[sighs]

8
00:02:20,046 --> 00:02:21,956
The dead number at least 47.

9
00:02:22,046 --> 00:02:25,456
Hard to get a firm count with
the state of some of the bodies.

10
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:26,666
Survivors?

11
00:02:27,421 --> 00:02:29,631
- [man] The horses are here.
- Well, Okhchen?

12
00:02:30,088 --> 00:02:31,258
A small group.

13
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:34,761
Attacked last night.
Then headed back the way they came.

14
00:02:35,171 --> 00:02:36,921
[man] Headed back for their barrow?

15
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:38,295
I believe so, sir.

16
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:41,591
Have the men prepare to move out.

17
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,840
Signal the other teams we've made contact.

18
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:47,673
We will track and destroy these monsters.

19
00:03:03,921 --> 00:03:06,881
Permission to speak freely,
Comrade Lieutenant?

20
00:03:06,963 --> 00:03:08,673
Of course, Sergei Pavlovich.

21
00:03:09,963 --> 00:03:12,343
I fear the teams are too far apart.

22
00:03:12,421 --> 00:03:15,381
We cannot support each other
if we encounter too many of them.

23
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:18,553
[Lieutenant] <i>I raised that concern also.</i>

24
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,880
<i>But the major thinks we can
cover more area this way.</i>

25
00:03:21,963 --> 00:03:24,593
<i>He's confident each team
can handle itself.</i>

26
00:03:24,963 --> 00:03:26,673
[Sergei] <i>And the planes we requested?</i>

27
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:29,875
[Lieutenant] <i>The Air Force is busy with</i>
<i>the Germans besieging Stalingrad.</i>

28
00:03:30,838 --> 00:03:33,918
<i>There's darkness
in every direction these days, comrade.</i>

29
00:03:34,338 --> 00:03:36,458
<i>We'll have to find our own way through it.</i>

30
00:03:45,463 --> 00:03:49,053
There are places like this
scattered throughout the deep forest.

31
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:51,511
Old places.

32
00:03:52,963 --> 00:03:55,093
My people believe they are cursed.

33
00:03:55,755 --> 00:03:57,085
[Lieutenant] I can feel it.

34
00:03:58,796 --> 00:04:00,336
The air feels...

35
00:04:01,505 --> 00:04:02,505
heavy.

36
00:04:03,463 --> 00:04:05,923
They are close now. They know we're here.

37
00:04:26,588 --> 00:04:28,588
- [beastly roar]
- [man yelling]

38
00:04:33,296 --> 00:04:34,756
[men yelling]

39
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:36,211
[man] Go!

40
00:04:39,005 --> 00:04:40,005
[man] Cover me!

41
00:04:40,921 --> 00:04:41,921
[man 2] Reloading!

42
00:04:44,213 --> 00:04:45,263
[Lieutenant] In the trees!

43
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,213
Behind us!

44
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,130
[gun clicks]

45
00:05:23,296 --> 00:05:24,456
[man yells] Move out!

46
00:05:31,213 --> 00:05:32,463
[chains clink]

47
00:05:33,338 --> 00:05:36,208
[men cough and groan]

48
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,380
[man whimpers and groans]

49
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:43,628
[Okhchen] Comrade Lieutenant!

50
00:05:53,005 --> 00:05:56,045
- [Lieutenant] What is it?
- A body, one of ours.

51
00:05:56,505 --> 00:05:59,005
Whatever happened to him,
it was some time ago.

52
00:06:00,296 --> 00:06:01,296
Cheka.

53
00:06:01,921 --> 00:06:03,211
Secret police.

54
00:06:03,505 --> 00:06:06,875
[chuckles]
This place was bad luck for him too.

55
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,630
Yes.

56
00:06:10,463 --> 00:06:12,713
And the sooner we're gone, the better.

57
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,418
[coughs]

58
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:27,625
[distant flare fires]

59
00:06:33,296 --> 00:06:34,296
Hey.

60
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,010
Can you play?

61
00:06:37,713 --> 00:06:40,513
Yes, I can, but I should not.

62
00:06:41,713 --> 00:06:42,713
Play for Maxim.

63
00:06:49,463 --> 00:06:51,463
- [gunfire]
- [men screaming] [balalaika playing]

64
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,880
[men hum]

65
00:07:28,213 --> 00:07:30,093
It was my fault, sir.

66
00:07:40,505 --> 00:07:41,545
[Lieutenant sighs]

67
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:44,955
[Sergei] Who was he?

68
00:07:45,838 --> 00:07:46,838
A Major.

69
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,300
Boris Grishin.

70
00:07:49,838 --> 00:07:53,378
He was assigned to Operation Hades.

71
00:07:55,713 --> 00:07:57,093
Does that mean anything to you?

72
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,550
I've heard rumors of it.

73
00:08:02,796 --> 00:08:07,046
An operation focused on
exploring arcane peasant myths.

74
00:08:08,005 --> 00:08:12,005
<i>[Lieutenant] In November 1919, after
the White Army was forced to retreat,</i>

75
00:08:12,088 --> 00:08:14,798
<i>Grishin was dispatched
on a secret mission.</i>

76
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,590
<i>He was an occultist.</i>

77
00:08:17,546 --> 00:08:21,756
<i>His assignment was to perform
a certain black magic ritual,</i>

78
00:08:22,505 --> 00:08:24,705
<i>whispered about among the Koryaks.</i>

79
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:30,760
<i>It was meant to summon unholy creatures
who could fight beside the Red Army.</i>

80
00:08:32,005 --> 00:08:35,875
<i>The operation doesn't seem to
have worked out very well for him.</i>

81
00:08:35,963 --> 00:08:37,963
[ground rumbles]

82
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:41,415
[beast growls]

83
00:08:44,505 --> 00:08:45,955
[beast roars]

84
00:09:01,421 --> 00:09:04,421
[Sergei] <i>We must take this information</i>
<i>to our superiors.</i>

85
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:06,625
<i>They could end this plague.</i>

86
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:10,713
<i>[Lieutenant] They would more likely end us
for revealing their past mistakes.</i>

87
00:09:11,921 --> 00:09:15,171
<i>No, we have our mission, comrade.</i>

88
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:17,011
<i>Nothing more.</i>

89
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,630
<i>Nothing less.</i>

90
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:25,916
Have you ever seen
a ghoul barrow that big, Lieutenant?

91
00:09:26,588 --> 00:09:27,588
Never.

92
00:09:29,171 --> 00:09:31,091
- [Lieutenant] Pogodin!
- [Pogodin] Sir.

93
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,761
[Lieutenant] Time to earn your pay.

94
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,588
Of course, comrade.

95
00:09:44,088 --> 00:09:46,008
[Okhchen] I've never seen so many tunnels.

96
00:09:50,463 --> 00:09:52,263
I don't like it down here.

97
00:09:52,546 --> 00:09:54,086
[Pogodin] Stop your whining.

98
00:09:54,171 --> 00:09:56,051
[growling and hissing]

99
00:09:56,171 --> 00:09:57,631
[Okhchen] I can hear them coming.

100
00:10:09,338 --> 00:10:11,878
- Pogodin.
- I'm working on it.

101
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,050
[rapid gun fire]

102
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,420
One more wire.

103
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,630
Pogodin!

104
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:18,506
Almost.

105
00:10:19,713 --> 00:10:21,633
- They're closing in!
- [ghouls howl and chitter]

106
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,415
[Okhchen]There's too many of them.

107
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:27,335
What's the hold up?

108
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,463
[distant rapid gunfire]

109
00:10:44,546 --> 00:10:48,756
You are getting older... and slower.

110
00:10:48,921 --> 00:10:50,171
[laughs]

111
00:10:50,255 --> 00:10:51,915
Next time, you do it!

112
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,630
[rumbling]

113
00:10:59,796 --> 00:11:00,836
Is it sealed?

114
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:04,206
Are we done?

115
00:11:17,463 --> 00:11:18,463
No.

116
00:11:38,588 --> 00:11:41,088
Sir, shall we prepare to fall back?

117
00:11:42,671 --> 00:11:44,921
The horses cannot outrun that horde.

118
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:48,625
The creatures will catch us in the trees
and tear us apart.

119
00:11:49,463 --> 00:11:51,513
We must make our stand here.

120
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:54,208
Sergei, bring me the fastest horse!

121
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:57,836
Kaminsky, unload all
the ammunition and explosives.

122
00:11:57,921 --> 00:11:59,461
Maxim, Oleg!

123
00:11:59,546 --> 00:12:02,456
Take those charges
and set them at the base of the cliff.

124
00:12:02,546 --> 00:12:03,586
Double time!

125
00:12:05,088 --> 00:12:07,958
Set up the machine gun positions
on our flanks.

126
00:12:09,171 --> 00:12:10,711
How can I help, sir?

127
00:12:11,213 --> 00:12:14,463
Hold the reins tight. She is fierce.

128
00:12:14,546 --> 00:12:17,206
One of us can make it through
if we slow them down.

129
00:12:17,296 --> 00:12:19,546
No. Please, sir. No!

130
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,090
[ghouls howl]

131
00:12:22,171 --> 00:12:23,801
I'd rather die with you.

132
00:12:25,088 --> 00:12:27,668
- I beg you, let me stay.
- Give the Major our coordinates.

133
00:12:27,755 --> 00:12:30,545
Tell him to bomb this place
into scorched rubble.

134
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,840
- Father, please.
- That...

135
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:34,416
is an order.

136
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,338
Ride like hell and don't look back!

137
00:12:45,255 --> 00:12:47,915
Comrades, we stand here.

138
00:12:48,505 --> 00:12:50,165
We die here!

139
00:12:50,255 --> 00:12:52,505
- It has been an honor!
