[woman] <i>Like millions of others,</i>

2
00:00:41,713 --> 00:00:45,463
<i>I'd heard Zima announce
the unveiling of his final work of art.</i>

3
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:51,340
<i>Over the years, I'd asked many times
for interviews and was always rejected.</i>

4
00:00:51,463 --> 00:00:54,423
<i>Now, for whatever reason,</i>

5
00:00:54,546 --> 00:00:58,506
<i>Zima Blue had requested to speak with me.</i>

6
00:00:59,671 --> 00:01:05,591
<i>I couldn't decide whether the blue was
a closer match to the sky or to the sea.</i>

7
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,630
<i>Neither, really.</i>

8
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,630
<i>Zima Blue, it was a precise thing.</i>

9
00:01:14,505 --> 00:01:17,005
<i>Little is known about Zima's history.</i>

10
00:01:17,546 --> 00:01:21,126
<i>It was said that he started his art career
in portraiture,</i>

11
00:01:22,255 --> 00:01:26,255
<i>but for Zima, the human form
was too small a subject.</i>

12
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:30,666
<i>The search for deeper meaning
caused him to look further...</i>

13
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,340
<i>to the cosmos itself.</i>

14
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,590
<i>That's how the mural work started.</i>

15
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:45,961
<i>They were undeniably brilliant.</i>

16
00:01:48,588 --> 00:01:53,208
<i>One day, Zima unveiled a mural
that had something different about it.</i>

17
00:01:54,546 --> 00:01:59,336
<i>In the middle of the canvas
was a tiny blue square.</i>

18
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:02,166
<i>- The square was just the beginning.</i>

[Claire] <i>Over the next several decades,</i>

20
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,210
<i>the abstract shapes changed
and became more dominant.</i>

21
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,956
<i>But, always,
the shade of blue was the same.</i>

22
00:02:13,088 --> 00:02:14,708
<i>It was Zima Blue.</i>

23
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:21,010
<i>Before very long, Zima unveiled
the first of his entirely blue murals.</i>

24
00:02:21,755 --> 00:02:25,665
<i>It was considered by many to be
as far as Zima could take things.</i>

25
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:28,705
<i>They couldn't have been more wrong.</i>

26
00:02:31,255 --> 00:02:34,255
<i>When most people speak about
his Blue Period,</i>

27
00:02:34,338 --> 00:02:39,008
<i>they mean the era of
the truly huge murals...</i>

28
00:02:40,213 --> 00:02:43,133
<i>but Zima was just getting started.</i>

29
00:02:48,963 --> 00:02:54,463
<i>It was a certain level of spectacle
that made Zima truly famous,</i>

30
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,460
<i>- even to those with no interest in art.</i>
- [crowd murmurs]

31
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,843
<i>But fame was never the point.</i>

32
00:03:06,588 --> 00:03:11,088
<i>In spite of all his success,
Zima was still dissatisfied</i>

33
00:03:12,546 --> 00:03:18,666
<i>and what he did next was, for many,
too extreme a sacrifice to make for art.</i>

34
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,340
- [Zima] Glad you could make it, Claire.
- [gasps]

35
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,630
How was the flight?

36
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,213
Relax, Claire.

37
00:03:36,421 --> 00:03:37,511
Hi.

38
00:03:38,546 --> 00:03:41,756
Some people find me intimidating,
but they quickly get over it.

39
00:03:42,463 --> 00:03:46,513
It's been over 100 years
since I've spoken to the press.

40
00:03:46,588 --> 00:03:51,048
I've invited you here because
I want you to help me tell my story.

41
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,210
Shall we take a little walk?

42
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,210
[Claire] <i>He was a handsome man,</i>
<i>even after all his transformations.</i>

43
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:03,381
<i>There was a planet called Kharkov Eight.</i>

44
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,460
<i>It specialized in
illicit cybernetic modifications.</i>

45
00:04:09,255 --> 00:04:13,085
<i>He underwent radical biological procedures</i>

46
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:16,631
<i>that enabled him to tolerate
extreme environments</i>

47
00:04:16,713 --> 00:04:19,383
<i>without the burden of a protective suit.</i>

48
00:04:20,546 --> 00:04:23,626
<i>His eyes could see in any known spectrum.</i>

49
00:04:24,546 --> 00:04:27,046
<i>He no longer breathed oxygen.</i>

50
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:31,090
<i>His skin was replaced with
pressurized polymer</i>

51
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:36,211
<i>and so he ventured forth
to commune with the cosmos.</i>

52
00:04:39,421 --> 00:04:42,171
<i>But what Zima eventually realized</i>

53
00:04:42,255 --> 00:04:45,705
<i>is that the cosmos was already speaking
its own truth</i>

54
00:04:46,088 --> 00:04:48,508
<i>far better than he ever could.</i>

55
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:56,761
My search for truth has led me here,

56
00:04:58,046 --> 00:05:01,086
to what will be my final piece.

57
00:05:02,421 --> 00:05:06,461
At last, I understand the thing
I sought through my art.

58
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:10,835
And what does this swimming pool
have to do with that?

59
00:05:11,088 --> 00:05:13,798
It's not just <i>any </i>swimming pool.

60
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:18,303
Long ago, it belonged to
a talented young woman

61
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,010
with a keen interest
in practical robotics.

62
00:05:21,296 --> 00:05:25,416
<i>She created dozens of robots
to do odd jobs around her house,</i>

63
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:30,665
<i>but she was especially fond of the one
she'd created to clean her swimming pool.</i>

64
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:35,921
<i>The little machine toiled endlessly,
scrubbing the ceramic sides of the pool.</i>

65
00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:40,548
<i>But the young woman wasn't satisfied
with the job it did.</i>

66
00:05:41,005 --> 00:05:43,505
<i>So she gave it a full color vision system</i>

67
00:05:43,588 --> 00:05:46,708
<i>and a brain large enough to process
the visual data</i>

68
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:48,836
<i>into a model of its surroundings.</i>

69
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:52,381
<i>She gave it the ability
to make its own decisions,</i>

70
00:05:52,463 --> 00:05:55,213
<i>to design different strategies
for cleaning the pool.</i>

71
00:05:55,838 --> 00:06:00,338
<i>She continued to use the machine as
a test-bed for new hardware and software.</i>

72
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,090
<i>And by stages, it became more aware.</i>

73
00:06:04,171 --> 00:06:06,761
<i>Eventually, the woman died.</i>

74
00:06:07,005 --> 00:06:08,705
<i>The little machine was passed</i>

75
00:06:08,796 --> 00:06:11,046
<i>- from one owner to the next.</i>
- [electronic whirring]

76
00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:15,548
<i>They added things, made modifications here and there
and with every iteration, it became more alive.</i>

77
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,378
<i>Became more...</i>

78
00:06:22,921 --> 00:06:23,921
me.

79
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,800
- [gasps]
- This is that same pool.

80
00:06:28,171 --> 00:06:30,261
I had it dug up. Moved here.

81
00:06:31,296 --> 00:06:37,166
But you're a man with machine parts,
not a machine that thinks it's a man.

82
00:06:37,255 --> 00:06:41,295
Sometimes, it's difficult even for me
to understand what I've become.

83
00:06:41,796 --> 00:06:45,456
And harder still
to remember what I once was.

84

[exhales]

85
00:06:47,546 --> 00:06:49,916
The blue of the tiles...

86
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:53,551
Zima Blue, the manufacturer called it.

87
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,630
The first thing I ever saw.

88
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,090
This was where I began.

89
00:06:59,296 --> 00:07:03,296
A crude little machine with barely enough
intelligence to steer itself.

90
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,800
But it was my world.

91
00:07:06,088 --> 00:07:10,338
It was all I knew, all I needed to know.

92
00:07:11,505 --> 00:07:12,625
And now?
