[Yan] <i>A terrible thing</i>
<i>had been done to me.</i>

165
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,710
[grunts]

166
00:12:41,171 --> 00:12:43,631
<i>But I could also be terrible.</i>

[screaming]

168
00:12:54,755 --> 00:12:57,085
We'll find some way to reverse this, Yan.

169
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,300
It's too late for that, Liang.

170
00:12:59,963 --> 00:13:01,713
What I want is to hunt.

171
00:13:01,796 --> 00:13:04,206
Hunt the men who think they can own us.

172
00:13:04,296 --> 00:13:07,336
The men who perpetrate evil,
but call it progress.

173
00:13:07,838 --> 00:13:08,958
I need you to help me.

174
00:13:11,713 --> 00:13:13,423
[Liang]<i> I told her I would do it.</i>

175
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:17,051
<i>The old magic may have been gone
from the world,</i>

176
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:22,050
<i>but I could make a new magic
from their machines.</i>

177
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,090
<i>A magic we could use against them.</i>

178
00:13:37,671 --> 00:13:39,671
[Yan groaning in pain]
[metal grinding]

179
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:07,713
[Yan] I'm ready.

[shrieks]

183
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,630
Good hunting, Yan.

No!

188
00:15:39,213 --> 00:15:41,053
Stop! [cries]

189
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,260
No!
