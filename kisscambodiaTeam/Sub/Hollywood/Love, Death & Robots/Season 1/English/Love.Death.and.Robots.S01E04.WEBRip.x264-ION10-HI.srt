[woman] Come on, Hank,
that scarecrow was a gift.

3
00:00:44,963 --> 00:00:47,013
Jake was just trying to be neighborly.

4
00:00:47,463 --> 00:00:49,763
Irrigating each other's crops,
that's neighborly.

5
00:00:50,171 --> 00:00:51,801
Sharing feed, that's neighborly.

6
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:56,456
That thing out there,
that's just a damn eyesore.

7
00:00:57,338 --> 00:00:58,338
One more slice, hon?

8
00:00:58,963 --> 00:01:01,513
[sighs] Another bite and I'd burst.

00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:11,461
- Ah, damn.
- What is it, Hank?

11
00:01:11,546 --> 00:01:12,956
Jenkins' cows again?

12
00:01:13,796 --> 00:01:15,006
Afraid not, honey.

13
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,920
Looks like we got holes
along the pasture fence again.

14
00:01:18,088 --> 00:01:20,668
Looks like there's a few more
out past the back fields.

15
00:01:21,296 --> 00:01:24,166
Yeah. Give Mel a ring,
make sure she's aware.

16
00:01:24,963 --> 00:01:25,963
Better get movin'.

17
00:01:26,088 --> 00:01:28,548
Don't like having our property line
exposed like that.

18
00:01:30,796 --> 00:01:35,416
You be careful out there, Henry Graves!
Mel, are you readin' me?

it's not budging.

[Henry] Go on, get outta here. Shoo!

30
00:02:42,755 --> 00:02:48,295
Moving the herd ain't a quick job, hon.
And I'm a little busy right now.

[Hank] Jesus. More breaches?

I don't know what it is, but something's
got 'em real riled up today.

- Sounds like Hank could use a hand.
- [sighs]

49
00:03:45,963 --> 00:03:49,843
I'm working on Carnigore, she ain't battle ready.
Come on, Jake, she ain't never gonna be perfect.

50
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:55,336
- Just get her out there.
- Carnigore's a work of art, woman.

51
00:03:55,671 --> 00:03:59,341
- You don't just march it into battle.
- You ain't no Michelangelo, Jake.

52
00:03:59,838 --> 00:04:00,838
You know that, right?

53
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:02,455
I'm more of a Da Vinci,

54
00:04:02,546 --> 00:04:05,006
'cause I got a handle on the aesthetics

Well, let's put it this way.

58
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:16,795
The good news is that I'm moving
the whole herd for you right now.

59
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,050
What the hell?
You seeing this up over the ridge?

60
00:04:21,838 --> 00:04:24,628
Yeah. Can't get a reading on it, though.
Can you get closer?

61
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:26,421
[Hank] Hang on.

62
00:04:30,213 --> 00:04:31,843
Holy shit!

63
00:04:33,255 --> 00:04:35,585
What? This can't be right.

64
00:04:36,088 --> 00:04:39,298
Sensors say we've got
thousands of DeeBees incoming.

65
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,420
Did you say thousands? Shit!

66
00:04:42,546 --> 00:04:44,456
Tell the others
to meet me at the ridge line.

67
00:04:46,046 --> 00:04:48,956
And get the bunker open.
Start bringing families in.

That's right, Jenny.

73
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,050
Any minute now, the whole damn valley's
gonna be DeeBee central.

74

Call Deb and Sarah,
pick 'em up on your way.

75
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,585
And then swing by Old Man Harrison.

00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:26,631
I don't care how drunk he is,
just get him moving.

I've been trying to tran you all night.

00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,205
Uh, Helen,
you sure I'm in the right place?

81
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,050
Is there a giant breach in front of you?

82
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,710
- [Jake] <i>Yeah.</i>
- Then you're in the right place.

83
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:49,086
<i>Just hold tight till Hank gets there.</i>

84
00:05:51,213 --> 00:05:53,553
Get that pile of
carnival scrap moving, Jake!

85
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,090
Get off my back, old woman.

86
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:58,551
[Hank] Will you two knock it off?
We've got work to do.

87
00:05:59,255 --> 00:06:03,085
Not a lotta cover out here, Hank.
Is this really the best place to hold?

88
00:06:03,255 --> 00:06:05,835
If we wanna buy time
for the families to reach the bunker,

89
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:07,591
it's gotta be here.

90
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,340
Beth, who else is coming?

91
00:06:09,421 --> 00:06:12,671
Zing's cut off.
The Camel brothers are pinned down.

92
00:06:13,213 --> 00:06:14,633
I'm sorry, Hank.

93
00:06:15,421 --> 00:06:17,261
Shit! Just the three of us?

94
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:20,795
Well, at least I'll die
young and beautiful.

- The Miller family and the Hutts are in.

102
00:07:20,255 --> 00:07:23,755
The Pennybone clan and the Priestleys said
ETA 15 to 20.

103
00:07:23,838 --> 00:07:26,088
- Can you hold?
- We'll do our damnedest.

104
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:29,045
[Jake] Twenty minutes?
We ain't gonna last two minutes out here.

105
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,210
We're staying as long as it takes.

106
00:07:32,546 --> 00:07:34,956
Here comes a whole lot of ugly!

107
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:39,341
- They're flanking us!
- Don't let any of them get past you.

108

"Become a farmer."

- Jake?

- Jake?
- Yeah, I'm still reloading.

Grab the others

You hear that, Hank? Everyone's in.
Come on, let's go.

Roger that, Jake!
Mel, time to get the hell outta here.

Jake, we're not gonna make it.

Woo! Come on!
And they call <i>me </i>crazy?

146
00:09:46,713 --> 00:09:48,713
They didn't see that one coming.

147
00:09:54,338 --> 00:09:57,128
Jake, they're coming around you.
Get outta there!

148
00:09:57,546 --> 00:09:58,546
Pull back!

149
00:09:58,838 --> 00:10:00,958
[Jake] Come on!
Plenty more where that came from.

150
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,130
Oh, shit!

151
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,170
Come on, baby. Oh, no...

152
00:10:11,005 --> 00:10:13,335
Jake? Hold on, we're coming.

153
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,763
Yeah, I'm reading you, Hank.
But I figure...
