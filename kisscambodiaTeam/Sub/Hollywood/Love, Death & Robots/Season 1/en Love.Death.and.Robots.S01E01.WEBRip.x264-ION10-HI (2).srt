annihilate as many humans as possible,

153
00:08:43,463 --> 00:08:44,713
as quick as possible.

154
00:08:44,796 --> 00:08:47,206
This exercise suddenly got
a little dark, didn't it?

155
00:08:47,338 --> 00:08:50,128
Well, to be fair,
they only used these a few times.

156
00:08:50,255 --> 00:08:53,005
To be fair,
you would only need a few times.

157
00:08:53,088 --> 00:08:55,588
- Also fair.
- This is the thing that killed them all?

158
00:08:55,671 --> 00:08:59,011
No. Indeed, it was their own hubris
that ended their reign,

159
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:01,798
their belief that they were
the pinnacle of creation

160
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,880
that caused them to poison the water,
kill the land and choke the sky.

161
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:08,513
In the end, no nuclear winter was needed,

162
00:09:08,588 --> 00:09:11,838
just the long heedless autumn
of their own self-regard.

163
00:09:11,921 --> 00:09:14,801
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, sorry.

164
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,420
Thought that would
sound better than,

165
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:20,125
"Nah, they just screwed themselves
by being a bunch of morons."

166
00:09:20,213 --> 00:09:22,053
Yeah, you can't just
crack one of those off.

167
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,170
You've got to warn us.

168
00:09:23,255 --> 00:09:24,545
[robot 3] Tip for next time.

169
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,840
I understand now.

170
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:28,881
Humans died out from
environmental disaster.

171
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:30,335
Yeah, pretty much.

172
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:34,131
And also because at one point,
they genetically engineered their cats

173
00:09:34,213 --> 00:09:36,173
to give them opposable thumbs.

174
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,455
[cat] Yes. Once we could open up
our own tuna cans,

175
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,420
that was pretty much that
for the human race.

176
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,260
Seems pretty heartless.

177
00:09:44,338 --> 00:09:46,008
Gentlemen, I'm a cat.

178
00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:51,505
Just to clarify, you are not going
to explode if we stop petting you, right?

179
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:53,626
I didn't say that.

180
00:09:53,755 --> 00:09:56,585
You guys better keep petting me
just to be sure.

181
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:58,801
Forever. Good.

182
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,130
Now, lower.

183
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:02,341
Oh, by the way, I brought some friends.

184
00:10:02,421 --> 00:10:03,551
[cats meow]

185
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,840
- [robot 1] Oh, fuck me.
- [camera clicks]

186
00:10:06,963 --> 00:10:10,303
[cat] Yes. Oh, that's nice.

187
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:12,381
I said lower.
