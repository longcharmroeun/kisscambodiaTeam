[Colby] I'll cover you until ammo's out,
then I'll scuttle.

151
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,920
I'm not gonna let them take you.

152
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:48,511
[man] <i>All right, boys, on me. Move.</i>

153
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,130
<i>Don't clump together. Keep going!</i>

154
00:09:53,046 --> 00:09:55,206
<i>Lee, move your ass!</i>

155
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:00,375
Come on, you fuckers!

156
00:10:07,046 --> 00:10:08,086
Fuck!

157
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:34,421
Fuck...

158
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:40,295
[gunfire continues]

159
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:44,915
[electronic throbbing]

160
00:10:45,671 --> 00:10:47,511
God, I'm so fucking sorry.

161
00:10:59,296 --> 00:11:00,706
[beeping]

162
00:11:09,463 --> 00:11:13,093
Five, four, three,

163
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:14,463
two...

164
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,050
She doesn't want to go.

165
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:30,921
[man] <i>Enemy in sight. Fire at will!</i>

166
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,210
You fuckers, get off my ship!

167
00:11:41,755 --> 00:11:44,295
[continuous tone rising in pitch]

168
00:11:47,921 --> 00:11:48,921
Get down!

169
00:12:20,755 --> 00:12:22,505
[Colby] <i>They patched us all up,</i>

170
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,050
<i>gave me the Distinguished Flying Cross
for conspicuous bravery under fire.</i>

171
00:12:32,463 --> 00:12:35,093
<i>They gave me one of those
new Whiskey Blackhawks.</i>

172
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,540
<i>- It's a fine ship, top of the line.</i>
- [metal scraping]

173
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:54,298
<i>Still, I'd trade it in a split second</i>

174
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,460
<i>to fly one more mission in </i>Lucky Thirteen.

175
00:13:06,796 --> 00:13:09,376
[man] <i>Lima One Three,</i>
<i>we have a visual on you.</i>
