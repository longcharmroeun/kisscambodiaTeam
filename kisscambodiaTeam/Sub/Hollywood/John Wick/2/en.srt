1
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,179
Almost.

2
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,292
Almost.

3
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,519
Sir, with all due respect,
are you sure this is our best option?

4
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,816
Why can't we just correct the problem?

5
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,163
Because my fucking nephew,

6
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,300
killed a dog.

7
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,474
And he stole a car.

8
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,160
A car...

9
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,279
which currently is among our inventory.

10
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,319
So we're giving everything up for a car?

11
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,674
It's not just a car.

12
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,990
It is John Wick's car.

13
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,092
Sir, why don't we just give it back?

14
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,512
He killed my nephew.

15
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,190
My brother.

16
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,078
And a dozen of my men.

17
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,312
Over his car.

18
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,954
And a puppy.

19
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,096
And you...

20
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:51,954
you think he will stop now?

21
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,992
Sir, he's one man.

22
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,559
Why don't we just eliminate him?

23
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,274
John Wick...

24
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,995
is a man of focus...

25
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,475
commitment...

26
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,514
and sheer fucking will.

27
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,399
He once killed three men in a bar...

28
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,648
With a pencil.

29
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:44,894
I know. I've heard the story.

30
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:46,519
With a fucking pencil!

31
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,433
Who the fuck can do that?

32
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,434
Well, I can assure you...

33
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,278
that the stories you hear about this man,

34
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,873
if nothing else...

35
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:05,080
has been watered down.

36
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,069
Mr. Wick.

37
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,635
Hey, buddy.

38
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,870
Hey.

39
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,189
Good dog.

40
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,116
<i>What are you doing, John?
Looking at you.</i>

41
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,349
<i>What are you doing?</i>

42
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,840
<i>I'm waiting for you.</i>

43
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,030
<i>Come here.</i>

44
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,730
Hey, boy.

45
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,993
Nice peaceful place you got here.

46
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,819
Hey, Aurelio.
Hey.

47
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,938
John, what the hell?

48
00:17:24,263 --> 00:17:25,875
I thought you loved this car.

49
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,235
What do you think?

50
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,889
Well, your motor's about to fall out and...

51
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,116
the chassis' all bent up,

52
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,179
the driveshaft is all destroyed.

53
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,700
And I don't know if you noticed,
but you got a crack in your windshield.

54
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,796
I mean,

55
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:42,460
what do I think?

56
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,060
I could fix this.

57
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,114
Thanks for finding her.

58
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,018
Not a problem, man.
I just made a few calls. No big deal.

59
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,634
Let me know when it's fixed.

60
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,713
All right.

61
00:17:58,138 --> 00:17:59,595
It'll be ready Christmas...

62
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,414
2030.

63
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,830
Ciao, John.

64
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,550
Santino.

65
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,676
Café?

66
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,909
Grazie.

67
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,276
Good to see you.

68
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,600
Good to see you.

69
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,990
I was sorry to hear about your wife, John.

70
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,600
Thank you.

71
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,550
Hi.

72
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,040
And the dog, does he have a name?

73
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,510
No.

74
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,924
Listen, John...

75
00:21:02,949 --> 00:21:04,654
with all sincerity...

76
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,840
I don't want to be here.

77
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,593
Please, don't.

78
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,512
I'm asking you not to do this.

79
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,670
I'm sorry.

80
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,588
No one,

81
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:23,144
gets out and comes back,

82
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:25,399
without repercussions.

83
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,140
I do this, with a heavy heart John.

84
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,656
But remember,

85
00:21:34,881 --> 00:21:37,140
if not for what I did,

86
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,972
on the night of your impossible task,

87
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,034
you wouldn't be here,

88
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,784
right now, like this.

89
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,853
This is because of me.

90
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,854
This in part is mine.

91
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,711
Take it back.

92
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,716
Take it back?
Take it back.

93
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,154
A marker is no small thing, John.

94
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,550
For a man to grant a marker to another,

95
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,155
is to bind a soul to a blood oath.

96
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,158
Find someone else.

97
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,054
Listen to me.

98
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,640
What is this?

99
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,937
Do you remember?

100
00:22:19,262 --> 00:22:20,533
This is your blood.

101
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,886
You came to me.

102
00:22:23,011 --> 00:22:24,378
I helped you.

103
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,100
If you don't do this,

104
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,556
you know the consequences.

105
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,537
I'm not that guy anymore.

106
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,117
You are always that guy, John.

107
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,274
I can't help you.

108
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,920
I'm sorry.

109
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,837
Yes.

110
00:23:15,162 --> 00:23:16,513
You're right.

111
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,750
You can't.

112
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,798
But he can.

113
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,719
I'll see you soon, John.

114
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,755
You have a beautiful home, John.

115
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,015
Buenasera.

116
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,517
Well, good evening, John.

117
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,695
Hey, Jimmy.

118
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,480
Gas leak?

119
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,079
Yeah, gas leak.

120
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,319
You working again?

121
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,634
I'll see you, Jimmy.

122
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,830
Come on, boy.

123
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,214
Night, John.

124
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,234
Oh, shit.

125
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,792
I'd like to see the manager.

126
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,600
How good to see you again so soon,
Mr. Wick.

127
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,875
Shall I announce you?

128
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,234
Yes, please.

129
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,714
Stay.

130
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,075
Mr. Wick is on his way to see you, sir.

131
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,629
Impeccable.

132
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,403
Put these,

133
00:27:52,828 --> 00:27:54,224
into circulation.

134
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,835
Where is he?

135
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,098
Thank you my friend.

136
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,651
Beautiful work. Beautiful.

137
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,579
What are you doing, Jonathan?

138
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,276
He burned my house down.

139
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,558
You rejected his marker.
You're lucky he stopped there.

140
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,192
What the hell were you thinking, giving
a marker to a man like Santino D'Antonio?

141
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,840
It was the only way I could get out.

142
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,933
You call this out?

143
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,556
What did you think was gonna happen?

144
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,338
What did you expect?

145
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,150
Did you really think this day
was never going to come?

146
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,479
What does he want you to do?

147
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,160
I didn't ask.

148
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,355
I just said no.

149
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,075
Two rules that cannot be broken, Jonathan.

150
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,074
No blood on Continental grounds,
and every marker must be honored.

151
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,236
Now while my judgment comes
in the form of excommunicado,

152
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,018
the High Table...

153
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,952
demand a more severe outcome
if their traditions are refused.

154
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,193
I have no choice?

155
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,432
You dishonor the marker, you die.

156
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,637
You kill the holder of the marker, you die.

157
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,871
You run, you die.

158
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,517
This is what you agreed to, Jonathan.

159
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,193
Do what the man asks.

160
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,795
Be free.

161
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,035
Then, if you want to go after him,
burn his house down, be my guest.

162
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,440
But until then...

163
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,350
Rules.

164
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,753
Exactly. Rules.

165
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,711
Without them, we'd live with the animals.

166
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,594
Do you board?

167
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,118
I'm sorry to say sir,
but this facility does not.

168
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,040
I however,

169
00:30:17,265 --> 00:30:20,436
would be willing to accept
the responsibility,

170
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:21,707
should you wish.

171
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,200
Appreciate that.

172
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,999
Does he have a name, sir?

173
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,170
No.

174
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,511
Good dog.

175
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,630
Stay.

176
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,394
This, was my father's collection.

177
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,196
I see little more
than just paint on canvas, of course.

178
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,477
But I do find myself here.

179
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,514
Please.

180
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,240
I didn't want to do this, John.

181
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,626
Had you stayed retired,

182
00:32:06,851 --> 00:32:08,280
I would have respected it.

183
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,750
Look at you.

184
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,216
You're thinking about it, aren't you?

185
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,150
You're counting exits...

186
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:19,895
guards...

187
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,552
Could you get to me in time?

188
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,578
How would you do it, I wonder?

189
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,910
That woman's pen?

190
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,430
His cane?

191
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,915
Maybe his glasses?

192
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,599
My hands.

193
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,397
How exciting.

194
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,719
Yet you know you cannot, can you?

195
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,295
I told you, I needed that guy,

196
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,190
the way you are looking at me right now.

197
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,089
I needed the Boogeyman.

198
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,360
I needed John Wick.

199
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,368
Just...

200
00:33:01,593 --> 00:33:03,677
tell me what you want.

201
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,235
I want you to kill my sister.

202
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,294
Why?

203
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,997
There are 12 seats at the High Table.

204
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,240
Camorra, Mafia, and 'Ndrangheta.

205
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,152
The Chinese, the Russian.

206
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,817
When my father died...

207
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,137
he willed his seat to her.

208
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,933
She represents Camorra.

209
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,976
And I can't help but wonder...

210
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,195
what I might accomplish in her stead.

211
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,050
You want me to kill...

212
00:33:49,075 --> 00:33:51,437
Gianna D'Antonio?

213
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,535
I could never do it.

214
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,813
She is my blood.

215
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,270
I still love her.

216
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,839
It can't be done.

217
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,382
She's in Rome,

218
00:34:03,607 --> 00:34:05,694
for her coronation.

219
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,507
You will take the catacombs in...

220
00:34:08,531 --> 00:34:11,021
It doesn't matter where she is.

221
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,380
That's why I need the ghost,

222
00:34:14,381 --> 00:34:16,459
lo spettro John Wick.

223
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,038
That's why I need you.

224
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,389
Do this for me,

225
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,212
and your marker is honored.

226
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,119
What say you?

227
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,952
Never one to waste words.

228
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,989
59, 0, 3.5.

229
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,360
Jonathan!

230
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,314
Julius.

231
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,178
Ciao.
Nice to see you.

232
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,278
I fail to recall the last time you were in Rome.

233
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,829
And here I'd heard,

234
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,069
you had retired.

235
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,835
I had.

236
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,826
Then humor me with...

237
00:37:26,951 --> 00:37:28,620
but one question.

238
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,730
No.

239
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,475
All right, then.

240
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,038
One of our finest rooms.

241
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,796
Grazie.

242
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,560
Enjoy your stay.

243
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,070
Mr. Wick.

244
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,119
Is the sommelier in?

245
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,078
I have never known him not to be.

246
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,799
Good afternoon, Mr. Wick.

247
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,675
It's been a long time.

248
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,319
I'd like a tasting.

249
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,393
I am quite excited to show you something.

250
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,830
First...

251
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,236
Buongiorno, Signor Wick.

252
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,310
Ciao, Angelo.

253
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,834
Welcome back to Rome.

254
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,750
I am.

255
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,912
I know of your past fondness
for the German varietals,

256
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:22,193
but I can wholeheartedly endorse
the new breed of Austrians.

257
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,920
Glock .34 and .26.

258
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,720
This is the original map
of the D'Antonio estate.

259
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,269
Here, you have all the ancient ruins.

260
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,800
Tell me, Mr. Wick,
is this a formal event or a social affair?

261
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,850
Social.

262
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:42,784
And is this for day or evening?

263
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,171
I need one for day and one for night.

264
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,489
Recontoured grips.

265
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,472
Flared magwell for easier reloads.

266
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,950
And I know you'll appreciate
the custom porting.

267
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,434
What's next?

268
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,960
I need something robust.

269
00:40:00,185 --> 00:40:01,174
Precise.

270
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,280
Robust.

271
00:40:02,905 --> 00:40:04,198
Precise.

272
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,599
This is the map of the temple,

273
00:40:07,924 --> 00:40:10,278
and catacombs underneath.

274
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,259
In what style?
Italian.

275
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,239
How many buttons?
Two.

276
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,993
Trousers?
Tapered.

277
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,475
How about the lining?

278
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,253
Tactical.

279
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,534
AR-15,

280
00:40:22,359 --> 00:40:24,039
11.5-inch.

281
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,113
Compensated with an ion-bonded bolt carrier.

282
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,259
Trijicon accupoint
with one-six magnification.

283
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:34,354
And this is the modern blueprint.

284
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,751
There are one, two, three gates.

285
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,319
Silicon carbide discs. Ceramic matrices.

286
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,039
Accompanying laminates.

287
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,873
Cutting-edge body armor.

288
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,636
We just sew it between the fabric
and the lining.

289
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,363
Zero penetration.

290
00:40:52,688 --> 00:40:53,724
However...

291
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,194
quite painful, I'm afraid.

292
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,737
Could you recommend anything
for the end of the night?

293
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,637
Something big, bold.

294
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,311
May I suggest the Benelli M4?

295
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,317
Custom bolt, carrier release
and charging handle.

296
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,063
Textured grips,

297
00:41:14,088 --> 00:41:15,321
should your hands get...

298
00:41:15,845 --> 00:41:16,545
wet.

299
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,852
An Italian classic.

300
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,276
Dessert?

301
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,577
Dessert.

302
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,626
The finest cutlery.

303
00:41:27,851 --> 00:41:29,393
All freshly stoned.

304
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,180
Well done.

305
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,352
Could you do a rush order?
I sure can.

306
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,338
Where would you like to have it sent?

307
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,456
The hotel.

308
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,173
Shall I have everything sent to your room?

309
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,556
Yes. Thank you.

310
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,180
Excellent.

311
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,055
Mr. Wick?

312
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,978
Do enjoy your party.

313
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,270
Good evening.

314
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,153
Are you enjoying the party?

315
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,000
Mr. Akoni.

316
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,392
Are you enjoying the festivities?

317
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,432
Please. Sit.

318
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,459
Ms. D'Antonio,

319
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,836
you can't just take what is rightfully mine...

320
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,115
Nothing was taken.

321
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,717
Those among your own
came to us with these territories.

322
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,359
A knife was pressed to their throats.

323
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,350
Semantics.

324
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,430
Besides...

325
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,751
That blade you speak of was meant
for their children.

326
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,436
They were only meant to watch.

327
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:33,236
What is yours is now ours, Mr. Akoni.

328
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,470
Now go.

329
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,000
Enjoy the party.

330
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,034
Have some fun.

331
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,494
Sì signora.

332
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,989
John.

333
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,070
Gianna.

334
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:58,674
There was a time not so long ago
in which I considered us as friends.

335
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,720
I still do.

336
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,675
Yet here you are.

337
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,991
What brought you back, John?

338
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,840
A marker.

339
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:23,990
Held by?

340
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,874
Your brother.

341
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,029
Tell me John.

342
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,554
This marker...

343
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,794
Is it how you got out?

344
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,810
And what was her name,

345
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,160
this woman whose life has ended my own?

346
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,835
Helen.

347
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,230
Helen.

348
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,914
This Helen...

349
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,912
was she worth the price
that you now seek to pay?

350
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,880
Now...

351
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,275
let me tell you what happens when I die.

352
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,432
Santino will lay claim
to my seat at the Table.

353
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,553
He will take New York.

354
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,958
And you will have been the one
who gifted it to him.

355
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,930
What would your Helen
think about that, John?

356
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,550
What would your Helen think about you?

357
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,155
Why?

358
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,119
Because...

359
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,432
I lived my life my way.

360
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,151
And I'll die my way.

361
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,954
Do you fear damnation, John?

362
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,150
Yes.

363
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,189
You know,

364
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,716
I always thought I could escape it.

365
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,717
That I'd see it coming.

366
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,277
That I'd see you.

367
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,150
John?

368
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,100
Cassian.

369
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,750
You working?

370
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,078
Yeah.

371
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,150
You?

372
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,750
Yeah.

373
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,350
Good night?

374
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,440
Afraid so.

375
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,199
I'm sorry to hear that.

376
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,600
Loose ends?

377
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,280
Yeah...

378
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,200
You're not having a good night,
are you, John?

379
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,390
Gentlemen!

380
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,036
Gentlemen!

381
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,033
Do I need to remind you,

382
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:10,759
that there will be no business

383
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,300
conducted on the Continental grounds?

384
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,016
No, signore.

385
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,355
No, sir.

386
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,150
Bene.

387
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:26,599
Now, may I suggest a visit to the bar,

388
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,160
so you can calm yourselves.

389
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,159
Gin, wasn't it?

390
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,250
Yes.

391
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,714
Bourbon, right?

392
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,160
Yeah.

393
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,394
I had a marker.

394
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:15,590
Whose?

395
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,200
Her brother.

396
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,410
I see.

397
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,913
You had no choice.

398
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,996
He wants her seat at the Table.

399
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,399
He will get it now.

400
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:42,395
Yeah.

401
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,290
Yeah.

402
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,149
So you're free.

403
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,430
Am I?

404
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:00,996
No.

405
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,360
Not at all.

406
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:08,242
You killed my ward.

407
01:07:09,267 --> 01:07:10,842
Someone I was close to.

408
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,154
An eye for an eye, John.

409
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:18,034
You know how it goes.

410
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,476
Yeah.

411
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,359
I'll make it quick.

412
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,200
I promise.

413
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,833
I appreciate that.

414
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,871
I'll try and do the same.

415
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,240
This round's on me.

416
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,470
Consider it a professional courtesy.

417
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,751
No. Thanks.

418
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,952
<i>Hello, John.</i>

419
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,516
<i>I understand if you're upset.</i>

420
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,420
<i>And I know it might feel personal.</i>

421
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,776
<i>But what kind of man would I be,</i>

422
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,919
<i>if I didn't avenge my sister's murder...</i>

423
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:48,890
John?

424
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,776
Could you let management know
I'll be checking out in the morning.

425
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:48,664
Operator.

426
01:10:48,965 --> 01:10:50,444
How may I direct your call?

427
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,776
Accounts payable.
<i>One moment, please.</i>

428
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:07,710
Accounts payable.
How may I help you?

429
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,075
<i>I'd like to open an account.</i>

430
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,494
Name on the account?

431
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:11,614
John Wick.

432
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,119
<i>Verification?</i>

433
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,432
9305-05.

434
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,360
<i>State of contract?</i>

435
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:19,840
Open.

436
01:11:19,965 --> 01:11:21,063
<i>Denomination?</i>

437
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:23,990
Seven million.

438
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:25,997
Processing. Please hold.

439
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,839
I appreciate the service.
My pleasure.

440
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,651
You will find safe passage below.

441
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,458
Transportation is waiting for you.

442
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:44,266
May you have a safe journey,

443
01:11:45,391 --> 01:11:46,521
Mr. Wick.

444
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,130
Order confirmed.

445
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:23,624
What is this?

446
01:13:23,749 --> 01:13:25,379
He completed the task.

447
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:28,231
The marker is over.

448
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:30,230
Mark it.

449
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,275
If Mr. Wick isn't dead already,

450
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,480
he soon will be.

451
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,720
Will you mark it, sir?

452
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,252
You have no idea,

453
01:13:56,753 --> 01:13:58,420
what's coming do you?

454
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,952
I have everyone in New York
looking for him.

455
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:05,550
I doubt we will see him again.

456
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:09,554
Do you now?

457
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,000
You stabbed the devil in the back,

458
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:17,712
and forced him back
into the life that he had just left.

459
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:21,940
You incinerated the priest's temple.

460
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:23,910
Burned it to the ground.

461
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,149
Now he's free of the marker,

462
01:14:27,574 --> 01:14:29,081
what do you think he'll do?

463
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:34,040
He had a glimpse of the other side,

464
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:35,759
and he embraced it.

465
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,638
But you, Signor D'Antonio...

466
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:40,236
took it away from him.

467
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,514
He was already back.

468
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,995
Oh, he came back for love, not for you.

469
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,385
He owed me.

470
01:14:46,710 --> 01:14:48,273
I had every right.

471
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:49,847
And now,

472
01:14:50,372 --> 01:14:51,877
he's coming again.

473
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,500
He did tell you not to do this.

474
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,075
He did warn you.

475
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,120
Addio Santino.

476
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:11,840
<i>Please notify MTA personnel of
any suspicious activity.</i>

477
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,518
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

478
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:25,271
<i>The Broad Street bound C train
is now arriving.</i>

479
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,194
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

480
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:31,637
<i>The Broad Street bound C train
is now arriving.</i>

481
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,356
<i>Next stop, Canal Street.</i>

482
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,519
<i>This is Canal Street.</i>

483
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:14,890
<i>This is the Broad Street bound C train.</i>

484
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:17,790
<i>Next stop is Rector Street.</i>

485
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,952
<i>This is Rector Street.</i>

486
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:52,839
<i>This is the Broad Street bound C train.</i>

487
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,196
<i>The next stop is Broad Street.</i>

488
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:20,716
<i>This is Broad Street.</i>

489
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:24,474
<i>This is the last stop
on the southbound C train.</i>

490
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,756
The blade is in your aorta.

491
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:29,036
You pull it out, you will bleed,
and you will die.

492
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,520
<i>This is the end of the line.</i>

493
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,316
Consider this a professional courtesy.

494
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,312
<i>This is Broad Street.</i>

495
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:43,518
<i>This is the last stop
on the southbound C train.</i>

496
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,318
<i>This is the end of the line.</i>

497
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:26,470
We see things, we see things.

498
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:29,837
The things you see are nightmares, man.

499
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,991
Like this one time...

500
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:36,834
Take me to him.

501
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,992
Tell him it's John Wick.

502
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,039
You know, they just...
they put it in everything!

503
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:02,315
Hey, man. You got a quarter?

504
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,997
As I live and breathe!

505
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:58,640
John Wick.

506
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:00,730
The man.

507
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:03,154
The myth.

508
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:04,469
The legend.

509
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:08,537
You're not very good at retiring.

510
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:10,793
I'm working on it.

511
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:15,431
Mr. Wick doesn't remember,
but we met many years ago,

512
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:17,418
before my ascension.

513
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:21,240
When I was just a pawn in the game.

514
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:25,800
We met and you gave me a gift,

515
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:27,633
the gift that would make me a king.

516
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:33,432
You don't remember, but there I was,
standing in an alleyway.

517
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:36,679
I didn't even hear you coming.

518
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:42,516
You gave me this.

519
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:48,499
Gift from the Boogeyman.

520
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:51,915
Perfect for every occasion.

521
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:56,796
But you also gave me a choice.

522
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:01,755
Pull my gun,
shoot you in the back, and die,

523
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:04,036
or keep the pressure on my neck...

524
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:06,716
and live.

525
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,553
And so you see, I survived.

526
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,835
No one sneaks up on me anymore,
thanks to you.

527
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,723
I am all-seeing,

528
01:27:19,348 --> 01:27:21,135
and all-knowing.

529
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,631
Then you know why I'm here.

530
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:29,619
Santino D'Antonio, yes.

531
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,295
Your contract went wide, John.

532
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,158
That's bad for your health.

533
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:38,192
What's the number up to now, Earl?

534
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,716
Seven million dollars!

535
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:42,790
Damn!

536
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,031
It's Christmas.

537
01:27:45,556 --> 01:27:47,317
We're going to Applebee's after this.

538
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,416
I need your help.

539
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,655
You have eyes begging for change
on every corner in the city.

540
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:59,036
I'm thinking you can find Santino.

541
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:01,950
I need you to move me.

542
01:28:02,075 --> 01:28:03,143
Underground.

543
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:04,575
Get me to him.

544
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:07,995
How sweet it is!

545
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,560
The Boogeyman begging me for help.

546
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:13,478
Well, of course, John.

547
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,960
Yes, John. Whatever you'd like, John.

548
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:18,994
Would you like a back rub with that, John?

549
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:21,719
You're going to help me.

550
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,196
Why the fuck would I do that?

551
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:29,389
Because I'm the only one
that can help you.

552
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,400
You're gonna help me out?

553
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:53,354
That's downright upright of you, Mr. Wick.

554
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:57,154
You sound positively magnanimous.

555
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:00,313
But look around you.

556
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:04,071
How much help does it look like I need?

557
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:16,232
It seems to me that the real question,
Mr. Wick,

558
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,788
is who in this cruel world of ours,

559
01:29:20,013 --> 01:29:21,544
is going to help you?

560
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:37,750
There's a storm coming.

561
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:39,314
Not just for me.

562
01:29:39,839 --> 01:29:41,094
For all of us.

563
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:43,320
For everyone under the Table.

564
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:47,310
Yes, killing someone who has a seat
at the High Table does create a problem.

565
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,432
But it's your problem, baby.

566
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:50,750
After all,

567
01:29:50,875 --> 01:29:54,063
none of my people sent Gianna D'Antonio...

568
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:56,753
to the hereafter.

569
01:29:58,280 --> 01:29:59,758
That being said,

570
01:30:00,083 --> 01:30:02,484
Santino has her seat now.

571
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:04,635
And he wants the city.

572
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:08,612
When he's done uptown,
you think he's gonna stop at 14th Street?

573
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:12,413
We'll just have to take care of ourselves.

574
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:13,795
Oh, yeah?

575
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:15,370
For how long?

576
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:17,680
And how much blood?

577
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:20,399
You kill Santino,

578
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:23,095
the Camorra,
and the High Table come for you.

579
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:27,597
I kill Santino, they come for me.

580
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:31,334
He's offered $7 million for your life.

581
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:37,153
Seven million dollars
is a lot of money, Mr. Wick.

582
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:45,117
So I guess you have a choice.

583
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:47,718
You want a war?

584
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,310
Or do you wanna just give me a gun?

585
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:02,411
Somebody, please!

586
01:31:02,636 --> 01:31:05,895
Get this man a gun!

587
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:15,633
Kimber 1911, .45 ACP.

588
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,714
Seven-round capacity.

589
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,115
Seven rounds?

590
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:34,796
Seven million dollars
gets you seven rounds.

591
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:38,357
That's a million dollars a round, baby.

592
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:51,070
Let's go.

593
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:55,400
Your descent into Hell begins here,
Mr. Wick.

594
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:56,709
He's at the museum.

595
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:58,439
Earl will guide you.

596
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:00,651
Do be careful on your way down.

597
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:03,685
Oh, and remember...

598
01:32:04,410 --> 01:32:05,814
you owe me.

599
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:09,078
You don't want me owing you.

600
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:40,635
Welcome everyone.

601
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:43,872
Let us toast to the future of the High Table,

602
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:45,079
and of course,

603
01:32:45,204 --> 01:32:47,436
to the memory of my dear sister.

604
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:05,379
Nice to see you.

605
01:33:06,503 --> 01:33:07,503
Nice to see you.

606
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,639
Mr. Akoni, how are you?

607
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:15,479
Wick is here.

608
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:17,050
Yeah.

609
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:10,313
You, and you with me.

610
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:11,354
You go.

611
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:29,454
<i>Welcome to Reflections of the Soul</i>

612

<i>at the New Modern NYC.</i>

613

<i>Within this exhibition,</i>

614
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:38,192
<i>the interplay of light

615

616
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,471

<i>into your understanding of the world,</i>

620

<i>into the nature of self.</i>

622
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:14,359
The marker is complete, John.

623
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:16,833
You should have just run away.

624
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:29,436
You know what the Camorra will do to you.

625
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:33,192
You think you're Old Testament?

626
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:35,500
No John.

627
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:38,950
No.

628
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:43,398
Killing me won't stop the contract.

629
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:46,202
Killing me,

630
01:37:47,127 --> 01:37:49,279
will make it so much worse.

631
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,110
John.

632
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:55,715
You know what I think?

633
01:37:58,360 --> 01:38:00,616
I think you are addicted to it.

634
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:01,990
To the vengeance.

No life.

No home.

Vengeance...

641
01:38:39,519 --> 01:38:40,994
it's all you have.

642
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:43,810
You wanted me back.

643
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:46,596
I'm back.

Good evening.

652
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:44,993
Is the manager in?

653
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:46,729
The manager,

654
01:43:47,054 --> 01:43:48,661
is always in.

655
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:54,950
Winston.

656
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:57,990
Mr. D'Antonio.

657
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,998
Your evening has been colorful, I see.

658
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:03,951
Seeking safe harbor, I presume?

659
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:07,256
I want his membership revoked. Now.

660
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:11,998
In the eyes of this institution,
Mr. Wick has breached no legalities.

661
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:14,197
Then you know that I have the right
to demand...

662
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:15,338
Nothing.

663
01:44:15,363 --> 01:44:18,537
You demand nothing of me, Mr. D'Antonio.

664
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:21,620
This kingdom is mine and mine alone.

665
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:25,533
All right.

666
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:28,954
Then enjoy your kingdom Winston,
while you still can.

667
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:33,016
And you, its privileges, sir.

668
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:48,200
I'm here to see Santino D'Antonio.

669
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:54,516
He's waiting for you in the lounge, sir.

670
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:47,110
Duck fat.

671
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:49,259
Makes all the difference.

672
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:50,940
Jonathan.

673
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:52,536
Have you seen the menu here?

674
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:56,496
Lot of options.
Jonathan, listen to me...

675
01:45:56,680 --> 01:45:58,428
A man can stay here,

676
01:45:58,853 --> 01:46:00,117
a long time,

677
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:01,979
and never eat the same meal twice.

678
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:06,037
Jonathan, just walk away.

679
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:09,310
Yeah, Jonathan.

680
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:12,014
Walk a...

681
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:20,738
What have you done?

682
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:25,870
Finished it.

683
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:45,658
How was he?

684
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:49,119
He was a good dog.
I have enjoyed his company.

685
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:55,396
Let's go home.

686
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:33,880
Mr. Wick?

687
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:42,511
If you would be so inclined.

688
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:17,830
Come on, boy.

689
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:29,030
It has been a pleasure, Mr. Wick.

690
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:37,060
Goodbye.

691
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:15,454
Jonathan.

692
01:50:16,040 --> 01:50:17,190
Winston.

693
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,355
What am I looking at?

694
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:24,955
The Camorra's doubled
Santino's open contract.

695
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:26,235
It's gone international.

696
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:28,755
High Table?

697
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:32,510
And the Continental?

698
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:36,517
You killed a man on company grounds,
Jonathan.

699
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:40,389
You leave me no choice
but to declare you excommunicado.

700
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:46,280
The doors to any service or provider
in connection with the Continental

701
01:50:46,460 --> 01:50:48,795
are now closed to you.

702
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:54,192
I am so sorry.

703
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:58,132
Your life is now forfeit.

704
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:02,697
Then why am I not dead?

705
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:06,476
Because I deemed it not to be.

706
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:10,470
Now.

707
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:39,479
You have one hour.

708
01:51:39,804 --> 01:51:41,702
I can't delay it any longer.

709
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:44,954
You might need this...

710
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:47,950
down the road.

711
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:53,390
Winston,

712
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,020
tell them.

713
01:51:57,480 --> 01:51:58,972
Tell them all.

714
01:51:59,560 --> 01:52:00,952
Whoever comes,

715
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:02,960
whoever it is,

716
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:05,480
I'll kill them.

717
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:08,119
I'll kill them all.

718
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:13,360
Ofcourse you will.

719
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:18,860
Jonathan.

720
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:22,180
Winston.

721
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:46,680
Accounts payable.

722
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:50,360
One one,

723
01:52:51,184 --> 01:52:52,284
one one,

724
01:52:53,008 --> 01:52:53,808
one.

725
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:56,592
In one hour.

726
01:52:58,200 --> 01:52:59,250
John Wick.

727
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:02,918
Excommunicado.

728
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:28,496
Order one one, one one, one.

729
01:53:29,221 --> 01:53:30,221
