1
00:00:54,057 --> 00:00:58,779
With every sun comes a new day.
A new beginning.

2
00:00:58,937 --> 00:01:02,419
A hope that things will be better today
than they were yesterday.

3
00:01:03,617 --> 00:01:06,268
But not for me.
My name is Eep.

4
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:09,546
And this is my family, the Croods.

5
00:01:09,697 --> 00:01:11,776
If you weren't clued in already by the
animal skins

6
00:01:11,777 --> 00:01:14,348
and sloping foreheads,
we're cavemen.

7
00:01:15,697 --> 00:01:20,100
Most days we spend in our cave,
in the dark.

8
00:01:20,257 --> 00:01:24,785
Night after night, day after day.

9
00:01:24,937 --> 00:01:28,987
Yep, home sweet home.

10
00:01:29,137 --> 00:01:33,938
When we did go out, we struggled to
find food in a harsh and hostile world.

11
00:01:35,337 --> 00:01:38,898
And I struggled to survive my family.

12
00:01:39,897 --> 00:01:43,060
We were the last ones around.
There used to be neighbors.

13
00:01:43,257 --> 00:01:45,783
The Gorts, smashed by a mammoth.

14
00:01:45,937 --> 00:01:48,907
The Horks, swallowed by a sand snake.

15
00:01:49,097 --> 00:01:51,304
The Erfs, mosquito bite.

16
00:01:51,457 --> 00:01:55,143
Throgs, common cold.

17
00:01:55,297 --> 00:01:58,062
And the Croods, that's us.

18
00:01:58,217 --> 00:02:01,903
The Croods made it, because of my dad.

19
00:02:02,057 --> 00:02:05,664
He was strong,
and he followed the rules.

20
00:02:05,817 --> 00:02:07,626
The ones painted on the cave walls.

21
00:02:07,777 --> 00:02:10,303
Anything new is bad, curiosity is bad.

22
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:14,786
Going out at night is bad.
Basically, anything fun is bad.

23
00:02:14,937 --> 00:02:16,939
Welcome to my world.

24
00:02:17,097 --> 00:02:22,501
But this is a story about how
all that changed in an instant.

25
00:02:22,657 --> 00:02:25,820
Because what we didn't know
was that our world...

26
00:02:25,977 --> 00:02:28,503
was about to come to an end.

27
00:02:28,657 --> 00:02:33,948
And there were no rules on our
cave walls to prepare us for that.

28
00:02:53,537 --> 00:02:57,064
You are supposed to wait
for my signal. Eep?

29
00:02:59,857 --> 00:03:01,302
Boo.

30
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:04,704
Ow! No!

31
00:03:09,017 --> 00:03:12,066
We've been in that cave forever.

32
00:03:12,217 --> 00:03:14,538
Three days is not forever.

33
00:03:14,697 --> 00:03:16,142
It is with this family.

34
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:20,700
Eep, would you come down here?
You're being so dramatic.

35
00:03:21,937 --> 00:03:24,588
No, Sandy, come back here.

36
00:03:24,777 --> 00:03:28,623
Remember the signal.
Good girls wait for the signal. Ugga.

37
00:03:28,777 --> 00:03:31,576
As soon as I get Sandy, I'll go back in,
and you can give the signal.

38
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:33,227
No, I mean, you're already out now.

39
00:03:33,377 --> 00:03:35,061
I'm waiting for the signal, Dad.

40
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:37,424
Never mind, Thunk. Just come out.

41
00:03:37,577 --> 00:03:41,218
But if you don't give the signal,
how do I know you're my dad?

42
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:43,067
The signal isn't so you know it's me.

43
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:46,067
It's so you know I wasn't eaten
by an animal.

44
00:03:46,257 --> 00:03:50,148
Then why is the signal an animal noise?
Doesn't that just confuse things?

45
00:03:50,457 --> 00:03:53,666
I don't know.
I'm still waiting for the signal.

46
00:04:12,257 --> 00:04:15,181
Mom, we're ready to leave.

47
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:17,542
Mom?

48
00:04:19,617 --> 00:04:21,984
Still alive.

49
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,548
It's still early.

50
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:26,428
And you're still fat.

51
00:04:26,577 --> 00:04:28,739
Breakfast formation!

52
00:04:29,977 --> 00:04:33,345
I want to see some real caveman action
out there. We do this fast.

53
00:04:33,497 --> 00:04:36,182
We do this loud.
We do this as a family.

54
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,739
And never not be afraid!

55
00:04:58,497 --> 00:05:00,545
Yay, breakfast.

56
00:05:16,657 --> 00:05:17,658
Who's up?

57
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:20,704
We'll flip for it.
Call her in the air.

58
00:05:20,857 --> 00:05:22,746
Heads!

59
00:05:23,537 --> 00:05:26,666
Tails. Thunk is in. Positions.

60
00:05:26,857 --> 00:05:28,939
Okay. Thunk...

61
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:30,508
Go.

62
00:05:32,217 --> 00:05:33,343
Come on, Thunk.

63
00:05:39,577 --> 00:05:41,659
Way to go.
Take it to the cave.

64
00:05:46,457 --> 00:05:48,141
Release the baby!

65
00:05:48,617 --> 00:05:50,346
Get them, Sandy! Go!

66
00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:14,982
Get them, Mom!

67
00:06:41,537 --> 00:06:46,384
Old lady down!
Eep, avenge me!

68
00:06:54,897 --> 00:06:56,137
Thanks.

69
00:07:05,417 --> 00:07:06,623
Eep!

70
00:07:06,777 --> 00:07:08,506
Heads up!

71
00:07:46,457 --> 00:07:48,186
Hey Dad, can we eat now?

72
00:07:48,377 --> 00:07:50,379
Just wait till we get home.

73
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,744
Eep, put on the brakes.

74
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:15,178
Eep!

75
00:08:35,977 --> 00:08:38,787
- Who is hungry?
- All right! Good one, Dad.

76
00:08:38,937 --> 00:08:41,383
Here you go, Thunk. Drink up.

77
00:08:44,177 --> 00:08:46,544
- Sorry, Dad.
- Looks like fast food tonight.

78
00:09:01,897 --> 00:09:05,060
That's all right. I ate last week.

79
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:10,259
Two knuckle warning!

80
00:09:10,457 --> 00:09:12,937
Come on, Croods. Go, go.

81
00:09:16,217 --> 00:09:19,221
Come on, come on. Darkness brings death.
We know this.

82
00:09:20,097 --> 00:09:22,577
The moon is full. Bath night.

83
00:09:22,737 --> 00:09:25,138
- Run for your life!
- You too, Mom.

84
00:09:25,297 --> 00:09:27,538
I don't want to lose
my protective layer.

85
00:09:27,697 --> 00:09:29,301
Mom, you've got ants.

86
00:09:31,097 --> 00:09:33,748
See? Sandy doesn't fuss.

87
00:09:38,257 --> 00:09:39,463
Is she still out there?

88
00:09:39,617 --> 00:09:41,779
You know she hates the cave, Grug.

89
00:10:07,937 --> 00:10:09,348
Please come back tomorrow.

90
00:10:09,497 --> 00:10:12,979
How could she not like the cave?
It's so cozy.

91
00:10:13,137 --> 00:10:16,300
It is a little dark, Grug.

92
00:10:16,457 --> 00:10:17,822
It's not that dark.

93
00:10:18,337 --> 00:10:19,338
Eep!

94
00:10:19,977 --> 00:10:21,217
Eep?

95
00:10:44,057 --> 00:10:47,300
Come on, I have to close the cave.

96
00:10:49,337 --> 00:10:50,338
Eep!

97
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:53,461
Okay, okay.

98
00:10:54,617 --> 00:10:56,187
Come on.

99
00:11:02,857 --> 00:11:05,258
Eep! Come down!

100
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:24,948
- That was too close.
- I was watching. I was fine.

101
00:11:25,097 --> 00:11:27,338
- What were you doing up there, Eep?
- I don't know.

102
00:11:27,497 --> 00:11:29,147
- What were you looking for?
- Nothing.

103
00:11:29,297 --> 00:11:30,947
- Then why did you go up there?
- I don't know.

104
00:11:31,137 --> 00:11:32,741
Why don't you know?

105
00:11:32,897 --> 00:11:34,467
Stop looking for things.

106
00:11:34,617 --> 00:11:38,588
Fear keeps us alive, Eep.
Never not be afraid.

107
00:11:39,017 --> 00:11:41,145
What is the point of all this?

108
00:11:41,697 --> 00:11:42,823
What was that?

109
00:11:42,977 --> 00:11:45,901
Why are we here?
What are we doing this for?

110
00:11:49,137 --> 00:11:51,185
No one said survival was fun.

111
00:11:51,337 --> 00:11:52,543
Nothing is fun.

112
00:11:52,817 --> 00:11:54,546
- Would you come down here?
- Grug.

113
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:55,776
- Eap.
- Grug.

114
00:11:55,777 --> 00:11:56,856
- Yes.
- Off!

115
00:11:56,857 --> 00:11:58,576
- Yes, I know. Okay, I'm trying to...
- Off.

116
00:11:58,577 --> 00:12:00,818
I just don't see why
she needs her own ledge, that's all.

117
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:02,826
- That's what this is about.
- She's working through some things...

118
00:12:02,977 --> 00:12:04,136
and she needs her own space.

119
00:12:04,137 --> 00:12:07,061
What things?
How long is this going to take?

120
00:12:07,257 --> 00:12:09,908
Really?
She already doesn't listen to me. Hey!

121
00:12:10,057 --> 00:12:11,582
See? She's listening.

122
00:12:11,777 --> 00:12:14,303
If she wants to survive,
she has to follow our rules.

123
00:12:14,737 --> 00:12:16,739
How about a story?
Eep loves those.

124
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:19,099
That's a good ide...
How about a story, huh?

125
00:12:19,257 --> 00:12:20,941
Yeah, tell us a story.

126
00:12:22,937 --> 00:12:25,099
Okay. Can I borrow that? Thank you.

127
00:12:25,257 --> 00:12:28,147
Eep, your old favorite.

128
00:12:28,297 --> 00:12:30,425
I haven't played with that thing in years.

129
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:33,268
Tonight we'll hear the story
of Krispy Bear.

130
00:12:34,297 --> 00:12:37,460
A long time ago,
this little bear was alive.

131
00:12:37,697 --> 00:12:40,462
She was alive
because she listened to her father...

132
00:12:40,617 --> 00:12:43,860
and lived her life in routine
and darkness and terror.

133
00:12:44,017 --> 00:12:45,826
So she was happy.

134
00:12:46,377 --> 00:12:50,621
But Krispy had one terrible problem.

135
00:12:50,777 --> 00:12:54,782
She was filled with... curiosity.

136
00:12:54,937 --> 00:12:56,666
- Grug.
- Yes. yes.

137
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,980
And one day, while she was in a tree...

138
00:13:00,137 --> 00:13:03,903
the curious little bear
wanted to climb to the top.

139
00:13:04,057 --> 00:13:06,298
And no sooner than
she climbed to the top...

140
00:13:06,457 --> 00:13:10,303
she saw something new and died!

141
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,300
- Just like that?
- Yes!

142
00:13:12,457 --> 00:13:16,667
Her last moments of terror
still frozen on her face.

143
00:13:16,817 --> 00:13:18,307
Same ending as every day.

144
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,977
I get it, Dad. I will never do
anything new or different.

145
00:13:21,137 --> 00:13:22,423
Good man, Thunk.

146
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:25,661
All right, everyone
sharpen your teeth, and let's pile up.

147
00:18:00,257 --> 00:18:01,258
Air.

148
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:02,907
You talk.

149
00:18:03,057 --> 00:18:04,946
I'm a person, like you.

150
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:09,624
Sort of like you.

151
00:18:12,617 --> 00:18:13,698
Okay, okay.

152
00:18:13,857 --> 00:18:14,938
Hey, hey, hey!

153
00:18:15,097 --> 00:18:16,462
Would you mind not...

154
00:18:19,177 --> 00:18:20,303
That tickles.

155
00:18:20,457 --> 00:18:22,061
Hey, hey, hey!

156
00:18:25,017 --> 00:18:26,018
Quiet!

157
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:28,299
I'm not supposed to be out here.

158
00:18:41,097 --> 00:18:42,098
Eep is gone.

159
00:18:42,257 --> 00:18:43,304
What? Grug!

160
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:44,583
Stay in the cave.

161
00:18:55,817 --> 00:18:57,945
Wow. You are really strong.

162
00:19:01,137 --> 00:19:02,582
Hey! No! It's mine.

163
00:19:02,737 --> 00:19:04,466
- Please! Wait.
- No!

164
00:19:04,617 --> 00:19:06,496
- It's dying! I can fix it!
- No! I caught it!

165
00:19:06,497 --> 00:19:07,862
Please! Please.

166
00:19:08,017 --> 00:19:09,303
I hate the dark.

167
00:19:19,257 --> 00:19:21,066
Come on, come on, come on.

168
00:19:23,297 --> 00:19:25,664
It does what you tell it?

169
00:19:25,817 --> 00:19:28,138
Yeah. Sort of.

170
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:29,298
The sun?

171
00:19:29,817 --> 00:19:32,218
No, no, no. Fire.

172
00:19:33,537 --> 00:19:35,744
Hi, fire.

173
00:19:38,617 --> 00:19:40,585
It's not alive.

174
00:19:40,737 --> 00:19:42,626
But you said it was dying.

175
00:19:43,537 --> 00:19:44,698
Sorry.

176
00:19:45,377 --> 00:19:47,106
It comes from where you come from?

177
00:19:47,297 --> 00:19:49,345
No. No, I make it.

178
00:19:49,737 --> 00:19:51,216
- Make some for me.
- Okay.

179
00:19:51,217 --> 00:19:52,256
Make!

180
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,338
It doesn't come out of me.

181
00:19:53,497 --> 00:19:55,306
Make! Make it!

182
00:19:56,857 --> 00:19:59,303
You do this a lot.

183
00:20:01,137 --> 00:20:02,980
Are you dead?

184
00:20:03,137 --> 00:20:05,219
Can I have your fire if you're dead?

185
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,623
Clear!

186
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:12,627
Hey, those are cold!

187
00:20:12,777 --> 00:20:15,303
You think? Listening shells, activate.

188
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:17,298
I concur.

189
00:20:17,697 --> 00:20:19,699
Tiger girl, we need to leave immediately.

190
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:22,140
I don't even know you.

191
00:20:23,777 --> 00:20:24,778
I'm Guy.

192
00:20:24,937 --> 00:20:25,938
Guy?

193
00:20:26,097 --> 00:20:28,703
And this is Belt.
Cook, conversationalist, navigator.

194
00:20:29,377 --> 00:20:31,027
Also, keeps my pants up.

195
00:20:31,577 --> 00:20:33,102
What are "pants up"?

196
00:20:33,257 --> 00:20:34,588
Who are you?

197
00:20:35,217 --> 00:20:36,218
Eep.

198
00:20:36,377 --> 00:20:38,459
Let me clarify, Eep.
The world is ending.

199
00:20:38,617 --> 00:20:39,696
What?

200
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,938
I'm calling it "The End."

201
00:20:45,217 --> 00:20:46,457
How do you know?

202
00:20:46,617 --> 00:20:48,097
I have seen it. It's coming this way.

203
00:20:48,217 --> 00:20:51,699
First, the ground is going to shake.
Then it breaks open. Everything falls in.

204
00:20:51,857 --> 00:20:53,018
Fire. Lava.

205
00:20:53,177 --> 00:20:54,857
I don't mean to sound too dramatic, but...

206
00:20:57,057 --> 00:21:00,778
Believe me, everything we are
standing on will be gone.

207
00:21:00,937 --> 00:21:03,065
We got to get to high ground.
I know a mountain, that way.

208
00:21:03,217 --> 00:21:04,901
It's our only chance.

209
00:21:05,617 --> 00:21:06,823
Come with me.

210
00:21:09,057 --> 00:21:11,378
I can't.

211
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:12,864
Okay.

212
00:21:14,897 --> 00:21:16,058
Here.

213
00:21:20,177 --> 00:21:23,101
If you survive, call me.

214
00:21:28,377 --> 00:21:29,822
Thank you.

215
00:21:30,617 --> 00:21:31,948
Hello?

216
00:21:32,497 --> 00:21:33,737
Hey!

217
00:21:35,897 --> 00:21:36,976
Dad!

218
00:21:36,977 --> 00:21:38,627
Are you hurt? What took you?

219
00:21:38,777 --> 00:21:41,144
Nothing. I left on my own.

220
00:21:41,537 --> 00:21:43,585
You what?

221
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:45,865
Dad, let me explain.

222
00:21:53,217 --> 00:21:54,821
You never let me talk.

223
00:21:54,977 --> 00:21:56,820
You're grounded.

224
00:22:00,537 --> 00:22:01,538
Hey!

225
00:22:03,537 --> 00:22:04,584
Eep!

226
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:05,898
Mom.

227
00:22:06,337 --> 00:22:07,498
Grug! What happened?

228
00:22:07,657 --> 00:22:10,945
You know what, I am so mad right now
that I can't talk to her.

229
00:22:11,217 --> 00:22:12,264
Eep?

230
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:15,496
You will never believe it.
I found something new.

231
00:22:15,497 --> 00:22:16,498
New!

232
00:22:16,617 --> 00:22:17,778
New is a big problem!

233
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:18,938
Wait, wait!

234
00:22:19,097 --> 00:22:20,826
Eep. Stay inside the family kill circle.

235
00:22:20,977 --> 00:22:22,900
- It wasn't bad.
-"New" is always bad.

236
00:22:23,057 --> 00:22:24,468
No. He was nice.

237
00:22:24,617 --> 00:22:26,585
What? Excuse me? He?

238
00:22:26,737 --> 00:22:30,742
I thought he was a warthog,
but then he turned into a boy.

239
00:22:30,897 --> 00:22:31,898
Strange.

240
00:22:32,057 --> 00:22:33,946
Usually it's the reverse.

241
00:22:34,137 --> 00:22:36,458
Eep's got a boy hog. Eep's got a boy...

242
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,103
There was a boy.

243
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:40,146
Watch. I'm going to call him.

244
00:22:56,817 --> 00:22:59,184
What is wrong with you?

245
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:00,338
It was dangerous.

246
00:23:00,537 --> 00:23:02,380
It was beautiful!

247
00:23:02,577 --> 00:23:04,659
You want to see dangerous? Here!

248
00:23:06,137 --> 00:23:07,218
My sniffer!

249
00:23:07,417 --> 00:23:08,536
Okay, that's it!

250
00:23:08,537 --> 00:23:09,948
We're going back to the cave...

251
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,623
and you're going to stay in there
until you're older than...

252
00:23:14,177 --> 00:23:15,256
her!

253
00:23:15,257 --> 00:23:16,338
What!

254
00:23:17,057 --> 00:23:19,822
You can't keep me inside forever!

255
00:23:31,297 --> 00:23:32,901
He said this would happen.

256
00:23:38,937 --> 00:23:40,507
Get to the cave!

257
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:43,378
Go!

258
00:24:14,137 --> 00:24:15,468
Look out!

259
00:24:16,777 --> 00:24:17,778
Stop!

260
00:24:57,217 --> 00:24:58,582
Is everyone okay?

261
00:24:58,777 --> 00:24:59,983
Yes.

262
00:25:00,497 --> 00:25:03,660
Grug, the cave...

263
00:25:03,817 --> 00:25:05,467
it's gone.

264
00:25:07,697 --> 00:25:08,937
No.

265
00:25:44,737 --> 00:25:48,059
You really need to see this.

266
00:26:04,577 --> 00:26:05,578
We should go there!

267
00:26:05,737 --> 00:26:08,820
No. No one is going anywhere.

268
00:26:11,697 --> 00:26:13,779
What else did that boy say?

269
00:26:38,617 --> 00:26:39,618
Grug?

270
00:26:40,337 --> 00:26:41,782
Just go! Just go!

271
00:26:41,937 --> 00:26:42,984
Go!

272
00:27:02,337 --> 00:27:06,467
One, two, three, four, five...

273
00:27:09,857 --> 00:27:11,143
Six.

274
00:27:11,977 --> 00:27:13,900
Where are we?

275
00:27:14,057 --> 00:27:16,219
I don't know. I'm not sure.

276
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:18,146
Down.

277
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:20,578
In a lower place.

278
00:27:20,737 --> 00:27:24,025
But one thing is for sure,
we can't go back the way we came.

279
00:27:25,457 --> 00:27:27,698
Sandy? What is it?

280
00:27:29,257 --> 00:27:31,498
No, no, no. Wait. Come back, Sandy!

281
00:27:38,537 --> 00:27:41,143
We can't be out in the open like this.

282
00:27:43,217 --> 00:27:45,026
We need a cave.

283
00:27:45,177 --> 00:27:47,942
Now, step where I step.

284
00:27:48,617 --> 00:27:50,267
Okay. Stay quiet.

285
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:52,897
Hopefully, nothing big
knows we're here yet.

286
00:28:02,737 --> 00:28:03,863
Wait.

287
00:28:05,097 --> 00:28:06,383
Okay.

288
00:28:06,537 --> 00:28:07,584
Wait.

289
00:28:08,337 --> 00:28:09,702
Okay.

290
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:10,938
Wait!

291
00:28:16,097 --> 00:28:17,178
Wait.

292
00:28:19,897 --> 00:28:21,058
Okay.

293
00:28:21,217 --> 00:28:22,298
Wait.

294
00:28:26,457 --> 00:28:27,458
Wait.

295
00:28:37,657 --> 00:28:38,704
<i>So, Dad...</i>

296
00:28:39,057 --> 00:28:42,618
just to be clear, are we looking for
the exact same cave?

297
00:28:42,777 --> 00:28:45,257
If it was me...
I'm just throwing this out there...

298
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:47,818
if it was me choosing the cave...

299
00:28:50,537 --> 00:28:53,143
I would go with a smaller cave.

300
00:28:54,657 --> 00:28:55,658
Wait.

301
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:00,538
Dad?

302
00:29:00,897 --> 00:29:02,547
I'll take care of this.

303
00:29:12,297 --> 00:29:13,817
All right, Dad, get them! Go get them!

304
00:29:14,337 --> 00:29:15,702
Now you got them right...

305
00:29:15,857 --> 00:29:16,983
Man, they're really...

306
00:29:17,137 --> 00:29:18,502
I'm loving this.

307
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:20,458
Dad, I got it.

308
00:29:20,617 --> 00:29:22,142
Just stop running into their fists.

309
00:29:23,697 --> 00:29:26,268
Grug, when you're done,
we should get going.

310
00:29:31,657 --> 00:29:34,627
That's right. You can't get past this!

311
00:29:55,097 --> 00:29:56,747
Climb! Climb! Climb!

312
00:30:05,817 --> 00:30:06,856
Cave!

313
00:30:06,857 --> 00:30:08,063
Go! Go!

314
00:30:08,457 --> 00:30:10,824
Come on! Hurry up. Let's go.

315
00:30:13,137 --> 00:30:16,107
Look! This cave has a tongue. Awesome!

316
00:30:32,417 --> 00:30:33,987
Okay.

317
00:30:34,137 --> 00:30:38,222
That's one, two, three, four, five, six.

318
00:30:38,377 --> 00:30:40,106
And seven...

319
00:30:40,257 --> 00:30:43,579
if we're counting Chunky the Death Cat.

320
00:30:54,057 --> 00:30:56,139
It's scared of the dark.

321
00:30:57,097 --> 00:30:59,748
Wait, we're scared of the dark.

322
00:31:36,657 --> 00:31:37,988
Kill circle!

323
00:31:48,177 --> 00:31:49,178
Eep!

324
00:32:10,057 --> 00:32:11,058
Eep!

325
00:33:11,017 --> 00:33:12,587
- Cavies!
-"Cavies"?

326
00:33:12,737 --> 00:33:15,263
Cavemen! Stand back!
They're practically animals.

327
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:18,023
- You see their bony, sloping foreheads?
- Yeah.

328
00:33:18,177 --> 00:33:20,703
The huge primitive teeth?

329
00:33:21,137 --> 00:33:22,138
Yeah.

330
00:33:22,297 --> 00:33:23,867
The excessive body hair.

331
00:33:24,257 --> 00:33:25,463
That one has got a tail.

332
00:33:25,577 --> 00:33:26,656
Yeah.

333
00:33:26,657 --> 00:33:29,342
All right. Close your eyes.
I'm going to have to take their lives.

334
00:33:29,537 --> 00:33:32,381
No! It won't help.
They're my family.

335
00:33:32,537 --> 00:33:33,538
What?

336
00:33:35,137 --> 00:33:36,468
The sun is in his hands!

337
00:33:36,617 --> 00:33:39,018
No, no. It's "fire."

338
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,503
Where did it come from?

339
00:33:40,657 --> 00:33:42,022
He made it.

340
00:33:42,217 --> 00:33:43,218
Make some for me!

341
00:33:43,377 --> 00:33:44,663
It doesn't come out of him.

342
00:33:44,817 --> 00:33:46,307
Make. Make it!

343
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:50,223
You're a lot like your daughter.

344
00:33:50,377 --> 00:33:51,902
Great, now he's broken.

345
00:33:52,057 --> 00:33:53,786
It's a baby sun.

346
00:33:54,297 --> 00:33:56,903
Hey, stay back.
We don't know what it wants.

347
00:33:57,057 --> 00:33:59,901
Now, we'll all sit here
and wait for the sun to come back.

348
00:34:00,057 --> 00:34:02,458
And tomorrow we'll find a new cave...

349
00:34:02,657 --> 00:34:05,308
and pretend today never happened.

350
00:34:05,457 --> 00:34:06,743
Isn't this fun, Eep?

351
00:34:06,897 --> 00:34:08,183
Eep, don't touch him.

352
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,668
Goodness knows where he's been.

353
00:34:09,817 --> 00:34:11,740
Dad, Sandy is hurting fire.

354
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,738
Sandy, no. Fire is not a plaything.

355
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:16,907
What a cute little guy.

356
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:18,866
Hey. Stay back.

357
00:34:20,937 --> 00:34:22,860
No, no, no, wait!

358
00:34:25,857 --> 00:34:27,063
It likes me.

359
00:34:27,217 --> 00:34:28,582
Hey! It's biting me!

360
00:34:30,617 --> 00:34:34,144
Thunk! Try hiding from it
in the tall, dry grass!

361
00:34:37,737 --> 00:34:39,785
No, stop. Please, I'm only nine.

362
00:34:39,937 --> 00:34:40,938
They're biting me!

363
00:34:44,537 --> 00:34:45,948
More fire babies.

364
00:34:47,217 --> 00:34:48,296
Hi.

365
00:34:48,297 --> 00:34:50,425
So, your dad, he is trying to kill me.

366
00:34:50,617 --> 00:34:52,381
Yeah. But I won't let him.

367
00:34:54,577 --> 00:34:56,102
Hold on, son. Come back!

368
00:34:57,657 --> 00:34:59,102
No, stop! Let me go!

369
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:02,465
Get out! Out! Out!

370
00:35:02,617 --> 00:35:04,506
Eat up, babies!

371
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:07,180
No, stop touching me!

372
00:35:08,297 --> 00:35:09,298
Die!

373
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:13,341
I win!

374
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:22,588
They're not so scary
once you get to know them.

375
00:35:24,297 --> 00:35:26,299
Who are you people?

376
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,868
I'm sorry.

377
00:35:28,017 --> 00:35:30,258
We're the Croods!

378
00:35:30,537 --> 00:35:31,777
And you are?

379
00:35:32,537 --> 00:35:33,616
Guy.

380
00:35:33,617 --> 00:35:34,982
Hi, Guy.

381
00:35:48,537 --> 00:35:49,584
Wow!

382
00:35:50,177 --> 00:35:51,781
It looks like magic.

383
00:35:51,937 --> 00:35:54,178
And smells like food.

384
00:35:59,977 --> 00:36:02,981
No, don't eat it, it's new.

385
00:36:06,977 --> 00:36:08,388
Still alive!

386
00:36:08,537 --> 00:36:10,460
Come on, keep eating.

387
00:36:14,057 --> 00:36:15,741
Hey, where is Guy?

388
00:36:22,377 --> 00:36:23,378
No!

389
00:36:23,537 --> 00:36:24,538
Going somewhere?

390
00:36:24,697 --> 00:36:27,223
The mountain? High ground?
End of the world, remember?

391
00:36:27,377 --> 00:36:30,381
That already happened.
It destroyed our cave.

392
00:36:30,537 --> 00:36:32,904
No. That was just the beginning of the end.

393
00:36:33,097 --> 00:36:35,543
The end of the end is still coming.

394
00:36:35,697 --> 00:36:37,825
Eep. Drop it.

395
00:36:40,937 --> 00:36:42,541
We can't let him go!

396
00:36:42,697 --> 00:36:45,906
What if we don't find a
cave before sunset?

397
00:36:46,057 --> 00:36:47,786
What if it takes a few days?

398
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,864
What if the birds come back?

399
00:36:52,417 --> 00:36:55,421
We need his fire, dummy!

400
00:36:56,417 --> 00:36:59,580
Fine. You're staying with us
until we find a cave.

401
00:36:59,737 --> 00:37:02,786
What? No, I'm not.
Don't make me a part of this!

402
00:37:03,217 --> 00:37:04,821
Stay here if you want, but let me go.

403
00:37:04,977 --> 00:37:06,103
I've got a dream...

404
00:37:06,297 --> 00:37:08,345
a mission, a reason to live!

405
00:37:08,497 --> 00:37:09,623
Not anymore.

406
00:37:09,777 --> 00:37:11,461
I've got an idea.

407
00:37:11,617 --> 00:37:13,585
Let's go to that mountain.

408
00:37:13,737 --> 00:37:14,738
It's too far.

409
00:37:14,897 --> 00:37:17,741
Dad really has his heart set on a cave.

410
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:21,338
There are caves on that mountain.

411
00:37:21,497 --> 00:37:22,737
Have you been there?

412
00:37:22,937 --> 00:37:23,984
It's a mountain.

413
00:37:24,137 --> 00:37:26,458
Mountains are safe.
Mountains have caves.

414
00:37:26,617 --> 00:37:28,619
And water. And sticks.

415
00:37:28,817 --> 00:37:31,343
Mom? Did you hear that?
I can get my own stick!

416
00:37:31,497 --> 00:37:33,943
Yes. Sticks and caves.
Caves and sticks.

417
00:37:34,097 --> 00:37:35,258
Crazy sticks. Let's go.

418
00:37:36,097 --> 00:37:37,258
Quiet!

419
00:37:47,817 --> 00:37:49,228
That thing is weird.

420
00:37:51,297 --> 00:37:53,186
No, no, no. It's okay, Sandy.

421
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:54,702
That's just Belt.

422
00:37:58,697 --> 00:38:00,028
I've made a decision.

423
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:02,657
We're going to that mountain.

424
00:38:03,257 --> 00:38:05,339
Don't ask me why. Just a hunch.

425
00:38:05,497 --> 00:38:07,181
Just feels right.

426
00:38:07,337 --> 00:38:10,466
I don't know, Grug.
We've never really walked that far.

427
00:38:10,617 --> 00:38:12,665
I don't think my feet can do that.

428
00:38:12,817 --> 00:38:15,468
I'll never live long enough to get there.

429
00:38:16,457 --> 00:38:17,822
Let's do it.

430
00:38:18,657 --> 00:38:20,705
Come on, just think.

431
00:38:20,857 --> 00:38:24,862
Our whole family packed together
on a long, slow, trip across country?

432
00:38:25,017 --> 00:38:26,940
Days and nights with just each other.

433
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:28,826
We'll tell stories. We'll laugh.

434
00:38:30,337 --> 00:38:33,386
We'll become closer as a family.

435
00:38:35,537 --> 00:38:36,538
Get her off!

436
00:38:36,697 --> 00:38:38,779
If you're not ready to challenge her,
then don't look her in the eye.

437
00:38:38,937 --> 00:38:41,986
Could you keep your big giant arms
on your side of the trail?

438
00:38:42,457 --> 00:38:45,779
Isn't this fun?
We're taking our first trip together.

439
00:38:46,497 --> 00:38:48,336
Stop shoving,
or I will pull out your tongue!

440
00:38:48,337 --> 00:38:50,499
Do you want me to
turn this family around? Do you?

441
00:38:50,657 --> 00:38:53,342
Because I will
turn this family around so fast!

442
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,147
Dad, I gotta go!

443
00:38:55,297 --> 00:38:57,379
- Come on, you can hold it.
- I don't think so.

444
00:38:57,577 --> 00:38:58,738
Sandy, take that out of your mouth.

445
00:38:58,897 --> 00:39:00,023
- I'm touching...
- Gran.

446
00:39:00,177 --> 00:39:02,657
Dad, I still gotta go!

447
00:39:02,817 --> 00:39:05,661
Fine. Just go behind one of those
lumpy things and make it fast.

448
00:39:06,057 --> 00:39:07,980
- Something bit me!
- I don't blame it.

449
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,696
Dad, can I take a turn carrying him?

450
00:39:10,697 --> 00:39:11,776
No.

451
00:39:11,777 --> 00:39:13,302
- How about now?
- No.

452
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:14,776
- Now?
- No.

453
00:39:14,777 --> 00:39:15,856
Now?

454
00:39:15,857 --> 00:39:18,098
I can do this all day long.

455
00:39:18,257 --> 00:39:21,545
No, no, no and still no.

456
00:39:21,697 --> 00:39:23,859
I'm not dying on an empty stomach.

457
00:39:24,057 --> 00:39:26,378
Grug, we're all pretty tired!

458
00:39:26,537 --> 00:39:27,902
We'll eat when we get there.

459
00:39:28,057 --> 00:39:29,502
It's taking too long!

460
00:39:29,657 --> 00:39:31,386
I'm grabbing a snack.

461
00:39:32,217 --> 00:39:33,981
Don't do that. He will cut you.

462
00:39:34,137 --> 00:39:36,060
That's not food, he's a pet. My pet.

463
00:39:36,217 --> 00:39:37,298
What's a pet?

464
00:39:37,457 --> 00:39:39,221
An animal you don't eat.

465
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,379
We call those "children."

466
00:39:42,697 --> 00:39:46,224
No man should have a pet.
It's weird and wrong.

467
00:39:47,057 --> 00:39:48,900
- It's food!
- No, please!

468
00:39:49,057 --> 00:39:50,821
Not that. That!

469
00:39:52,417 --> 00:39:53,907
Food fixes everything.

470
00:39:54,057 --> 00:39:55,582
Show me your hunting face.

471
00:39:58,057 --> 00:39:59,582
Not you. You're still grounded.

472
00:39:59,737 --> 00:40:01,068
Come on, Thunk.

473
00:40:01,217 --> 00:40:02,867
My feet hurt.

474
00:40:09,257 --> 00:40:10,941
- You look tense.
- I'm not tense.

475
00:40:11,497 --> 00:40:14,580
Angry girl wants to be doing
what they're doing.

476
00:40:15,377 --> 00:40:16,583
I wasn't ready.

477
00:40:17,857 --> 00:40:19,621
Hang on, Thunk, I'm coming!

478
00:40:19,897 --> 00:40:21,626
Why are you doing this?

479
00:40:22,897 --> 00:40:24,103
What are they doing?

480
00:40:24,257 --> 00:40:25,463
Hunting.

481
00:40:25,617 --> 00:40:27,619
Get it off! You stay away from me.

482
00:40:27,777 --> 00:40:28,938
No, seriously, what are they doing?

483
00:40:29,097 --> 00:40:32,101
You've got a ton of eggs.
Just make another egg.

484
00:40:47,137 --> 00:40:49,139
Now you're just rubbing it in.

485
00:40:50,457 --> 00:40:53,586
There, who's hungry for scorpion?

486
00:40:55,737 --> 00:40:58,217
What happened to the egg and the bird?

487
00:40:58,817 --> 00:40:59,978
We lost him.

488
00:41:00,137 --> 00:41:02,788
But when the bird stepped on me
and pushed me into the ground...

489
00:41:02,937 --> 00:41:05,019
the scorpion grabbed a hold of me...

490
00:41:05,177 --> 00:41:07,498
and one thing led to another
and here we are eating him.

491
00:41:07,657 --> 00:41:08,704
So, win-win.

492
00:41:08,857 --> 00:41:11,508
Not enough. Not enough!
I need more.

493
00:41:11,657 --> 00:41:14,467
I need more.

494
00:41:14,777 --> 00:41:17,508
Look at that.
She's not going to eat me, right?

495
00:41:17,657 --> 00:41:18,658
You're too skinny.

496
00:41:18,817 --> 00:41:20,865
If she was going to eat anyone
it would be...

497
00:41:21,617 --> 00:41:22,736
Mom!

498
00:41:22,737 --> 00:41:24,341
She's locked her jaw!

499
00:41:24,497 --> 00:41:26,306
Get a stick! Get a stick!

500
00:41:28,137 --> 00:41:29,343
Stay away!

501
00:41:29,657 --> 00:41:31,307
You sick old monster!

502
00:41:31,457 --> 00:41:33,266
Hurry! Put the stick in her mouth!

503
00:41:34,817 --> 00:41:36,421
Hold her still. Use a rock.

504
00:41:38,257 --> 00:41:40,464
Ugga, would you just hit her legs?

505
00:41:41,577 --> 00:41:42,863
Why are you rolling away?

506
00:41:43,017 --> 00:41:45,019
I just want something to eat.

507
00:41:45,177 --> 00:41:48,340
You have bug for dinner. Plenty of bug!

508
00:41:48,537 --> 00:41:49,538
Please.

509
00:41:50,497 --> 00:41:51,942
I'll let you help me hunt.

510
00:41:52,097 --> 00:41:53,178
Really?

511
00:41:53,977 --> 00:41:56,457
Don't wait on me. They're all over me.

512
00:41:56,617 --> 00:41:58,142
Tell my story.

513
00:42:04,937 --> 00:42:06,302
Okay.

514
00:42:07,377 --> 00:42:08,458
What do you call this?

515
00:42:08,617 --> 00:42:09,823
A trap.

516
00:42:10,017 --> 00:42:11,143
What does it do?

517
00:42:11,297 --> 00:42:12,298
Well...

518
00:42:21,177 --> 00:42:23,225
How long have you been alone?

519
00:42:27,137 --> 00:42:29,663
So, what do we do?

520
00:42:30,897 --> 00:42:32,547
How's your acting?

521
00:42:58,217 --> 00:42:59,423
You're good at this.

522
00:43:03,737 --> 00:43:05,227
No. Sorry.

523
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:06,538
Okay.

524
00:43:06,737 --> 00:43:08,421
- Yeah, that's yours.
- Excuse me.

525
00:43:09,777 --> 00:43:11,108
Your other hand...

526
00:43:11,257 --> 00:43:13,658
- That's my arm.
- Okay, I'm moving it.

527
00:43:18,457 --> 00:43:19,822
Going under.

528
00:43:24,457 --> 00:43:27,745
It didn't step in your trap-y thing.

529
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:30,343
Yeah, I noticed!

530
00:43:34,617 --> 00:43:35,743
Where's Eep?

531
00:43:42,337 --> 00:43:43,907
She's awesome.

532
00:43:45,217 --> 00:43:46,298
Eep!

533
00:43:47,017 --> 00:43:48,064
Dad,no!

534
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:01,705
It's an avalanche of flavor.

535
00:44:29,617 --> 00:44:31,619
Looks like we won't be
having any leftovers.

536
00:44:31,777 --> 00:44:33,700
What are "left overs"?

537
00:44:33,857 --> 00:44:36,177
When you have so much food to eat,
you have some left over.

538
00:44:36,537 --> 00:44:38,699
We never have that much food.

539
00:44:51,177 --> 00:44:53,305
Grug, how about a story?

540
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:55,824
That's a good idea. How about a story?

541
00:44:56,337 --> 00:44:58,260
Yeah, tell us a story!

542
00:45:00,937 --> 00:45:04,464
Once upon a time,
there was a little tiger...

543
00:45:04,617 --> 00:45:07,188
who lived in a cave with her family.

544
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:08,543
There were a lot of rules...

545
00:45:08,737 --> 00:45:13,664
but the big, simple one
was to never leave the cave at night.

546
00:45:13,817 --> 00:45:18,618
And the door was so heavy,
you'd think it would be easy to remember.

547
00:45:18,777 --> 00:45:20,063
So easy to remember!

548
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,457
I know.

549
00:45:22,257 --> 00:45:24,544
But, while everyone was asleep...

550
00:45:24,697 --> 00:45:26,062
she went out anyway.

551
00:45:26,257 --> 00:45:27,702
- No!
- Yes!

552
00:45:27,857 --> 00:45:30,622
And no sooner than she did,
their cave was destroyed...

553
00:45:30,777 --> 00:45:33,383
and everyone had to go
on this long, sucky walk...

554
00:45:33,537 --> 00:45:35,301
with some weirdo they met...

555
00:45:35,457 --> 00:45:36,902
and die!

556
00:45:38,937 --> 00:45:40,143
The end.

557
00:45:41,457 --> 00:45:44,825
I did not see that coming. Twist ending.

558
00:45:44,977 --> 00:45:46,581
My stories never end like that.

559
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:48,586
Yes! Two stories in one night!

560
00:45:57,737 --> 00:46:01,344
Okay. But it won't be as good as Grug's.

561
00:46:05,097 --> 00:46:09,307
Once upon a time,
there was a beautiful tiger.

562
00:46:09,457 --> 00:46:12,381
She lived in a cave
with the rest of her family.

563
00:46:12,537 --> 00:46:16,303
Her father and mother told her,
"You may go anywhere you want..."

564
00:46:16,457 --> 00:46:20,018
"but never go near the cliff,
for you could fall."

565
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:22,748
And die. Good story.

566
00:46:23,377 --> 00:46:25,379
But when no one was looking...

567
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:29,898
she'd go near the cliff...

568
00:46:30,057 --> 00:46:31,980
for the closer she came to the edge...

569
00:46:32,137 --> 00:46:35,584
the more she could hear,
the more she could see...

570
00:46:35,737 --> 00:46:37,660
the more she could feel.

571
00:46:39,857 --> 00:46:41,063
Finally...

572
00:46:41,217 --> 00:46:44,426
she stood at the very edge.

573
00:46:44,577 --> 00:46:46,341
She saw a light.

574
00:46:46,497 --> 00:46:49,580
She leaned out to touch it...

575
00:46:50,137 --> 00:46:51,298
and she slipped.

576
00:46:51,617 --> 00:46:52,982
And she fell.

577
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:55,066
And she flew.

578
00:46:57,377 --> 00:46:58,788
Where did she fly?

579
00:46:59,217 --> 00:47:00,378
Tomorrow.

580
00:47:00,537 --> 00:47:01,663
Tomorrow?

581
00:47:01,817 --> 00:47:04,707
A place with more suns in the sky
than you can count.

582
00:47:04,897 --> 00:47:06,262
It would be so bright.

583
00:47:06,417 --> 00:47:09,182
A place not like today, or yesterday.

584
00:47:09,337 --> 00:47:12,147
A place where things are better.

585
00:47:13,977 --> 00:47:15,786
Tomorrow isn't a place.

586
00:47:16,817 --> 00:47:18,148
You can't see it!

587
00:47:18,297 --> 00:47:20,186
Yes, it is.

588
00:47:20,857 --> 00:47:22,268
I've seen it.

589
00:47:25,097 --> 00:47:26,986
That's where I'm going.

590
00:47:36,337 --> 00:47:40,342
We are going to shut our eyes and sleep.

591
00:47:40,777 --> 00:47:41,938
And when we wake up...

592
00:47:42,137 --> 00:47:44,496
we're going to find the place
that has everything we want.

593
00:47:44,497 --> 00:47:45,616
Tomorrow?

594
00:47:45,617 --> 00:47:46,948
A cave.

595
00:48:26,017 --> 00:48:27,826
That was too close. it almost caught us.

596
00:48:28,017 --> 00:48:29,781
I was watching. We were fine.

597
00:48:29,977 --> 00:48:31,103
We gotta move faster.

598
00:48:31,257 --> 00:48:34,306
Do you people have any other speed
aside from "wander"?

599
00:48:34,457 --> 00:48:36,505
I'll take a shamble at this point.

600
00:48:36,697 --> 00:48:38,506
Hey, do you have a minute?

601
00:48:38,697 --> 00:48:40,506
How did the tiger fly?

602
00:48:40,697 --> 00:48:43,098
I only share when I'm outside the log.

603
00:48:43,257 --> 00:48:44,622
I'm funny that way.

604
00:48:44,777 --> 00:48:47,781
Leave this to me.

605
00:48:48,697 --> 00:48:49,983
Hey, Thunk...

606
00:48:50,137 --> 00:48:52,105
you have a spider on your face.

607
00:48:54,297 --> 00:48:55,458
Oops.

608
00:48:55,777 --> 00:48:57,222
He's loose!

609
00:49:02,017 --> 00:49:05,544
Do not step on those weird pointy rocks.

610
00:49:05,697 --> 00:49:06,983
Do you mean these rocks?

611
00:49:08,137 --> 00:49:09,980
Do not step on these rocks!

612
00:49:10,137 --> 00:49:11,866
Step aside, girls.

613
00:49:14,177 --> 00:49:17,147
Hello? Nobody's listening!
No one is listening.

614
00:49:17,297 --> 00:49:20,141
You cannot walk on those!

615
00:49:33,017 --> 00:49:34,178
Get back here now!

616
00:49:34,817 --> 00:49:37,502
There goes our chance for survival.

617
00:49:37,657 --> 00:49:39,500
And our log!

618
00:49:40,497 --> 00:49:41,498
Okay.

619
00:50:01,697 --> 00:50:04,701
Jumping doesn't help. It does briefly...

620
00:50:04,857 --> 00:50:06,188
but it doesn't get better.

621
00:50:08,177 --> 00:50:09,508
How about...

622
00:50:09,657 --> 00:50:12,183
Don't walk on your hands.
The hands do not help at all.

623
00:50:19,737 --> 00:50:21,227
Come on.

624
00:50:23,217 --> 00:50:24,548
I can help you...

625
00:50:24,697 --> 00:50:27,223
but we're going to have to
make a few changes around here.

626
00:50:27,377 --> 00:50:29,379
The log ride is over.

627
00:50:29,537 --> 00:50:30,868
Drop the log.

628
00:50:35,257 --> 00:50:37,225
Now, kick it away.

629
00:50:40,377 --> 00:50:41,867
Farther.

630
00:50:46,577 --> 00:50:47,738
Really?

631
00:50:48,417 --> 00:50:51,626
Okay, smart "Guy"...

632
00:50:51,777 --> 00:50:53,063
now what?

633
00:51:07,737 --> 00:51:09,785
Good fish, good fish.

634
00:51:13,297 --> 00:51:15,948
Okay. Now you can look.

635
00:51:20,217 --> 00:51:22,743
I love them!
Where are my feet?

636
00:51:22,897 --> 00:51:24,103
They're still there!

637
00:51:25,217 --> 00:51:26,218
Okay.

638
00:51:28,577 --> 00:51:29,817
You're really heavy.

639
00:51:29,977 --> 00:51:31,103
Really?

640
00:51:31,257 --> 00:51:32,418
Thank you!

641
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:35,107
Hey. Wait!

642
00:51:38,457 --> 00:51:39,743
Okay.

643
00:51:39,897 --> 00:51:41,626
She's up. We're good. I'm good.

644
00:51:41,777 --> 00:51:45,418
These shoes are great!
Where do you get these ideas?

645
00:51:49,417 --> 00:51:51,499
I'm calling it a "brain."

646
00:51:51,657 --> 00:51:53,978
I'm pretty sure it's
where ideas come from.

647
00:51:54,137 --> 00:51:57,186
Dad, I don't have a brain.

648
00:51:57,457 --> 00:52:00,620
We've gotten along just fine
without brains until now.

649
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:03,980
Cavemen don't need brains.
We have these.

650
00:52:04,977 --> 00:52:08,424
That's what I'm talking about!
Ideas are for weaklings.

651
00:52:08,617 --> 00:52:10,824
Now, let's get to that mountain!

652
00:52:13,977 --> 00:52:16,139
Wow! I love those!

653
00:52:16,297 --> 00:52:18,504
Good fish. Don't eat my feet.

654
00:52:55,337 --> 00:52:58,147
So, how did the tiger fly?

655
00:52:58,297 --> 00:53:00,140
She jumped on the sun...

656
00:53:00,297 --> 00:53:02,026
and rode it to Tomorrow.

657
00:53:03,977 --> 00:53:05,979
No,no,no.

658
00:53:38,617 --> 00:53:39,618
Hi, Dad!

659
00:53:40,937 --> 00:53:42,587
Bye. Dad!

660
00:53:47,417 --> 00:53:49,943
You've seen rain before, right?

661
00:53:50,097 --> 00:53:52,384
We don't get out much.

662
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:14,942
Eep, looks dangerous.

663
00:54:15,897 --> 00:54:18,138
Dad, you say that about everything.

664
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:19,298
Careful.

665
00:54:19,497 --> 00:54:20,783
Really? Okay.

666
00:54:54,977 --> 00:54:57,821
No, no, no. Not cool!

667
00:55:18,337 --> 00:55:22,183
So, the bear says, "Your cave? I've been
dumping my bones here since last week."

668
00:55:22,377 --> 00:55:23,503
Last week!

669
00:55:24,457 --> 00:55:25,982
That's a funny story!

670
00:55:26,137 --> 00:55:28,219
It's not a story. It's a joke.

671
00:55:28,377 --> 00:55:29,663
What's a "joke"?

672
00:55:29,857 --> 00:55:32,861
Just making something up
to make you laugh.

673
00:55:38,057 --> 00:55:39,218
- One for you.
- Thanks.

674
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:42,347
One for you. And this one's for you.

675
00:55:43,057 --> 00:55:44,058
Okay.

676
00:55:44,217 --> 00:55:46,060
Okay! That's enough!

677
00:55:47,537 --> 00:55:49,539
I don't see why the kids
need their own shells.

678
00:55:49,697 --> 00:55:51,777
So if anyone gets in trouble,
we can call the others.

679
00:55:51,897 --> 00:55:54,707
Wait, you're saying we should split up?

680
00:55:54,857 --> 00:55:57,861
We can try more paths at once.
It's the fastest way through.

681
00:55:58,017 --> 00:56:00,543
Croods stick together.
Your way isn't safe.

682
00:56:00,697 --> 00:56:01,698
They can handle it.

683
00:56:01,857 --> 00:56:03,097
We can do it, Dad.

684
00:56:03,257 --> 00:56:04,861
No,no,no.

685
00:56:05,057 --> 00:56:07,059
It's my job to keep you safe.

686
00:56:07,217 --> 00:56:10,539
I'm still in charge
and we are not splitting up.

687
00:56:11,217 --> 00:56:12,343
Except for you two.

688
00:56:13,057 --> 00:56:14,388
And that's final.

689
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,707
Hello?

690
00:56:35,857 --> 00:56:37,825
Is everyone all right?

691
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,263
We're okay, Grug.

692
00:56:39,417 --> 00:56:41,499
Dad? I'm freaking out a little bit.

693
00:56:41,657 --> 00:56:44,228
Just tell me what to do.
What do I do? What do I do right now?

694
00:56:44,377 --> 00:56:46,266
Stay where you are. I'll find you.

695
00:56:46,417 --> 00:56:48,021
No. Too slow.

696
00:56:48,177 --> 00:56:51,101
Everybody, keep moving forward
and we'll get out.

697
00:56:51,257 --> 00:56:52,258
Dad?

698
00:56:54,257 --> 00:56:55,782
Yeah.

699
00:56:55,937 --> 00:56:57,302
Okay.

700
00:56:57,457 --> 00:56:59,937
Remember, never not be afraid.

701
00:57:00,097 --> 00:57:01,986
You can do this!

702
00:57:02,137 --> 00:57:04,299
It's going to be okay,
it's going to be okay.

703
00:57:04,457 --> 00:57:06,619
I'm going to pass out.

704
00:57:08,297 --> 00:57:10,220
Sandy. Sandy!

705
00:58:59,937 --> 00:59:01,541
Give me another one.

706
00:59:05,137 --> 00:59:06,502
You dropped these.

707
00:59:40,137 --> 00:59:41,662
Come with me.

708
00:59:44,577 --> 00:59:46,261
Here, boy! Catch!

709
00:59:48,617 --> 00:59:50,028
Yoo-hoo!

710
00:59:50,177 --> 00:59:51,417
Gran?

711
00:59:53,977 --> 00:59:54,978
Mom?

712
00:59:55,137 --> 00:59:56,627
Wow.

713
00:59:58,137 --> 00:59:59,548
Grug?

714
01:00:07,457 --> 01:00:09,141
I'll go get him.

715
01:00:15,377 --> 01:00:17,618
Good boy! Who's a good boy?

716
01:00:17,777 --> 01:00:19,825
You are! Yes, you are! Look at you!

717
01:00:19,977 --> 01:00:21,786
You need a name. You want a name?

718
01:00:21,937 --> 01:00:23,621
I'm going to call you Douglas.

719
01:00:23,817 --> 01:00:26,104
Can you do tricks? Roll over.

720
01:00:26,257 --> 01:00:28,146
Come on, Douglas, roll over.

721
01:00:33,137 --> 01:00:35,139
Good boy, Douglas!

722
01:00:38,817 --> 01:00:40,467
I was in love once.

723
01:00:40,617 --> 01:00:43,461
He was a hunter. I was a gatherer.

724
01:00:43,617 --> 01:00:46,018
It was quite a scandal.

725
01:00:46,817 --> 01:00:50,185
We fed each other berries, we danced.

726
01:00:50,337 --> 01:00:53,659
Then my father smashed him with a rock
and traded me to your grandfather.

727
01:00:58,497 --> 01:01:00,067
Croods!

728
01:01:00,217 --> 01:01:01,503
Get down here.

729
01:01:01,657 --> 01:01:04,467
Grug, they're okay. Guy is with them.

730
01:01:05,017 --> 01:01:07,224
Guy is with them. Okay.

731
01:01:07,737 --> 01:01:08,818
Thank you.

732
01:01:08,977 --> 01:01:12,868
Thank you for bringing me
that interesting Guy update.

733
01:01:13,297 --> 01:01:14,981
Okay. I'm going to go up...

734
01:01:15,137 --> 01:01:19,825
and why don't you join us
when you stop being a big drag!

735
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:29,587
Sleep pile?

736
01:01:33,817 --> 01:01:35,581
How about a story?

737
01:01:38,217 --> 01:01:39,548
Anyone?

738
01:01:42,097 --> 01:01:46,182
And then Torg said,
"Know it? I drew it."

739
01:01:47,897 --> 01:01:49,740
That makes no sense.

740
01:01:51,497 --> 01:01:54,580
I know it was hard for you
to bring us along...

741
01:01:54,737 --> 01:01:57,627
but they had the
best day of their lives.

742
01:01:58,937 --> 01:02:01,417
Thank you for that.

743
01:02:23,697 --> 01:02:26,268
I want to show you something.

744
01:03:06,737 --> 01:03:08,978
More suns in the sky than you can count.

745
01:03:09,777 --> 01:03:13,827
Every sun that crosses our sky
comes to rest up there.

746
01:03:13,977 --> 01:03:15,820
Tomorrow.

747
01:03:15,977 --> 01:03:17,820
That's where we'll be safe.

748
01:03:18,657 --> 01:03:20,500
I'm going with Guy.

749
01:03:20,817 --> 01:03:23,343
No. Not my little girl.

750
01:03:27,697 --> 01:03:29,461
Come with us.

751
01:03:29,817 --> 01:03:31,342
I can't go without Grug.

752
01:03:31,497 --> 01:03:34,182
That makes one of us. Count me in.

753
01:03:34,337 --> 01:03:35,987
Really, Mom? Now?

754
01:03:36,177 --> 01:03:38,384
Grug has no idea how to protect us.

755
01:03:38,537 --> 01:03:40,665
In fact, he has no ideas at all!

756
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:43,821
No, that's not true.
What about that one time when he...

757
01:03:46,017 --> 01:03:47,303
Face it.

758
01:03:47,457 --> 01:03:50,506
If he actually had an idea of his own...

759
01:03:50,657 --> 01:03:52,864
I'd have a heart attack and die!

760
01:03:58,337 --> 01:03:59,338
Grug?

761
01:03:59,457 --> 01:04:00,663
- Dad!
- Dad!

762
01:04:00,817 --> 01:04:03,980
He's a big guy. How could he
just disappear like that?

763
01:04:04,137 --> 01:04:07,903
Hey, wait! Let's ask that ugly lady
if she's seen Dad.

764
01:04:08,897 --> 01:04:10,228
Haven't seen him.

765
01:04:11,137 --> 01:04:12,741
What are you doing?

766
01:04:12,897 --> 01:04:13,976
Yeah.

767
01:04:13,977 --> 01:04:17,698
I was up all night, because
all these ideas just kept coming to me.

768
01:04:17,857 --> 01:04:19,507
Is that a snake?

769
01:04:19,657 --> 01:04:21,705
Belt, new and improved.

770
01:04:23,577 --> 01:04:26,183
It's even self-tightening!

771
01:04:27,337 --> 01:04:29,066
What is that on your head?

772
01:04:29,217 --> 01:04:31,185
It's called desperation.

773
01:04:31,337 --> 01:04:33,738
I call it a "rug." Rhymes with "Grug."

774
01:04:33,897 --> 01:04:36,901
And this one, I call it a "ride."

775
01:04:37,057 --> 01:04:38,218
Rhymes with "Grug."

776
01:04:38,377 --> 01:04:39,378
That doesn't rhyme...

777
01:04:39,537 --> 01:04:41,904
It's going to get us
places faster than shoes.

778
01:04:42,697 --> 01:04:44,586
Yeah! Try to keep up!

779
01:04:50,737 --> 01:04:52,580
I wish I had a ride.

780
01:04:52,777 --> 01:04:55,303
And painting is a thing of the past.

781
01:04:55,457 --> 01:04:57,903
I call this a "snapshot."

782
01:04:59,057 --> 01:05:01,298
Let's do it again. I think I blinked.

783
01:05:02,577 --> 01:05:04,864
I call them "shades."

784
01:05:05,057 --> 01:05:06,980
The sun doesn't hurt my eyes anymore.

785
01:05:07,137 --> 01:05:08,946
Where do you get these great ideas?

786
01:05:09,097 --> 01:05:10,383
Since I don't have a brain...

787
01:05:10,537 --> 01:05:12,938
they're coming from my stomach,
down deep below...

788
01:05:13,097 --> 01:05:15,259
and then up again into my mind.

789
01:05:18,097 --> 01:05:20,099
Grug, we have to keep moving.

790
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:23,068
See, I got ideas. I got thoughts.

791
01:05:23,217 --> 01:05:26,221
Like this. I call it a "mobile home."

792
01:05:26,377 --> 01:05:28,106
Isn't that something?

793
01:05:31,137 --> 01:05:33,816
And I'm calling this one a "lifterator."

794
01:05:33,817 --> 01:05:34,896
Mom?

795
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:36,058
I know. It's bad.

796
01:05:40,137 --> 01:05:42,265
I almost feel sorry for him.

797
01:05:47,097 --> 01:05:48,622
No, I don't.

798
01:05:49,457 --> 01:05:51,459
What are you trying to do, Grug?

799
01:05:51,617 --> 01:05:55,622
See, I thought if I could have ideas...

800
01:05:55,937 --> 01:05:57,268
like Guy...

801
01:05:58,137 --> 01:06:00,265
maybe Eep would listen to me.

802
01:06:00,417 --> 01:06:04,138
And maybe she wouldn't
want to go with Guy.

803
01:06:04,297 --> 01:06:05,662
Grug.

804
01:06:05,817 --> 01:06:08,297
Is that what this is all about?

805
01:06:11,657 --> 01:06:14,866
And I also thought
it would kill your mother.

806
01:06:15,017 --> 01:06:17,497
So win-win.

807
01:06:17,657 --> 01:06:19,102
We're here!

808
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,387
Wow.

809
01:06:57,697 --> 01:06:58,736
Cave!

810
01:06:58,737 --> 01:06:59,738
Everyone inside.

811
01:06:59,897 --> 01:07:01,023
Hurry up. Let's go.

812
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:02,423
Let's go. Go!

813
01:07:04,697 --> 01:07:05,823
No!

814
01:07:08,537 --> 01:07:10,062
No more caves, Grug.

815
01:07:10,217 --> 01:07:11,336
What?

816
01:07:11,337 --> 01:07:15,023
We're going to jump on the sun
and ride it to Tomorrow with Guy!

817
01:07:15,177 --> 01:07:17,498
Wait. So you're all going to do this?

818
01:07:19,217 --> 01:07:20,264
Thunk?

819
01:07:21,777 --> 01:07:23,267
Sorry, Dad.

820
01:07:25,057 --> 01:07:27,378
You have to stop worrying for all of us.

821
01:07:27,577 --> 01:07:30,262
It's my job to worry!
It's my job to follow the rules!

822
01:07:30,417 --> 01:07:32,260
The rules don't work out here!

823
01:07:32,457 --> 01:07:33,618
They kept us alive!

824
01:07:33,777 --> 01:07:37,862
That wasn't living!
That was just not dying.

825
01:07:38,017 --> 01:07:39,382
There's a difference.

826
01:07:39,537 --> 01:07:42,063
Ugga, everyone,
you have to listen to me.

827
01:07:42,257 --> 01:07:45,306
We would be dead if we listened to you!

828
01:07:46,857 --> 01:07:48,859
We have to follow Guy now.

829
01:07:53,297 --> 01:07:54,298
Guy.

830
01:07:55,057 --> 01:07:56,468
Guy? Run.

831
01:08:06,257 --> 01:08:07,418
This is pointless!

832
01:08:07,617 --> 01:08:09,381
We're running out of time.
Everything is collapsing.

833
01:08:09,577 --> 01:08:11,625
You're being irrational
and counterproductive!

834
01:08:11,777 --> 01:08:13,108
Big words anger me!

835
01:08:13,657 --> 01:08:14,818
Keep talking.

836
01:08:14,977 --> 01:08:16,217
Countermeasures!

837
01:08:18,297 --> 01:08:19,981
You remember how you were
this morning? You changed.

838
01:08:20,137 --> 01:08:21,901
Idea man. Modern man.

839
01:08:22,617 --> 01:08:25,621
I am a caveman!

840
01:08:25,777 --> 01:08:26,983
No, no, no, wait!

841
01:08:48,337 --> 01:08:49,456
No!

842
01:08:49,457 --> 01:08:52,461
What is this stuff that saves you
from my punches?

843
01:08:53,817 --> 01:08:54,936
Tar.

844
01:08:54,937 --> 01:08:57,304
No. I have to get back to them.

845
01:08:58,017 --> 01:08:59,216
Stop struggling.

846
01:08:59,217 --> 01:09:00,218
No!

847
01:09:00,337 --> 01:09:01,338
Grug, stop!

848
01:09:08,297 --> 01:09:10,664
No one gets out of this.

849
01:09:11,697 --> 01:09:13,665
Believe me...

850
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:15,307
I know.

851
01:09:16,497 --> 01:09:17,498
Your...

852
01:09:17,657 --> 01:09:20,342
Family. Yeah.

853
01:09:26,457 --> 01:09:28,061
Sorry.

854
01:09:31,337 --> 01:09:33,863
I was little when it happened.

855
01:09:34,857 --> 01:09:37,303
Last thing my parents told me was...

856
01:09:37,497 --> 01:09:38,828
"Don't hide."

857
01:09:39,697 --> 01:09:41,187
"Live."

858
01:09:43,017 --> 01:09:45,384
"Follow the sun."

859
01:09:45,537 --> 01:09:47,665
"You'll make it to Tomorrow."

860
01:09:50,017 --> 01:09:52,019
You followed the light.

861
01:09:52,817 --> 01:09:54,819
My daughter is a lot like you.

862
01:09:54,977 --> 01:09:56,024
No.

863
01:09:56,177 --> 01:09:57,702
She's like you.

864
01:09:57,857 --> 01:10:00,906
She loves you,
but always forgets to say it.

865
01:10:01,057 --> 01:10:03,583
Just like you forget to tell her.

866
01:10:06,657 --> 01:10:11,788
I guess I was just busy
keeping them all alive.

867
01:10:12,177 --> 01:10:15,704
It's okay. That's what dads do.

868
01:10:22,377 --> 01:10:25,187
That's right.

869
01:10:25,377 --> 01:10:27,584
But we can't do that from here.

870
01:10:27,737 --> 01:10:30,422
We need one of your ideas.

871
01:10:33,257 --> 01:10:36,101
Come on. You can do it.

872
01:10:40,417 --> 01:10:43,421
Belt! Emergency Idea Generator, activate!

873
01:10:46,097 --> 01:10:47,223
I've got it.

874
01:10:53,337 --> 01:10:54,416
Wow.

875
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:57,387
Yeah, I know. But he's doing
the best with what he has.

876
01:10:57,577 --> 01:10:58,738
Let's go.

877
01:11:04,097 --> 01:11:05,781
There he is.

878
01:11:05,937 --> 01:11:08,668
Belt, I want romance, drama, sincerity.

879
01:11:08,817 --> 01:11:09,818
Move me.

880
01:11:15,937 --> 01:11:17,302
Okay, he sees us.

881
01:11:17,457 --> 01:11:19,778
That's our cue. Now, work it!

882
01:11:29,097 --> 01:11:30,337
He's not coming over.

883
01:11:30,497 --> 01:11:32,296
I don't think our puppet
looks scared enough.

884
01:11:32,297 --> 01:11:34,664
Scared? I'll show you scared.

885
01:11:34,817 --> 01:11:36,421
Hand me those acting sticks!

886
01:11:52,817 --> 01:11:54,501
Hold on!

887
01:12:24,217 --> 01:12:26,219
Yes! You did it.

888
01:12:27,297 --> 01:12:28,298
- Grug!
- Dad!

889
01:12:28,497 --> 01:12:30,704
Hey! We're okay!

890
01:12:33,177 --> 01:12:34,542
Yeah.

891
01:12:35,537 --> 01:12:37,027
We're okay.

892
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:51,548
Grug, your call.

893
01:12:52,697 --> 01:12:54,665
Take us to Tomorrow.

894
01:13:00,937 --> 01:13:02,063
Hurry!

895
01:13:02,217 --> 01:13:04,424
Come on! We're going to make it!

896
01:13:06,057 --> 01:13:07,627
You were right.

897
01:13:07,777 --> 01:13:10,223
There it is! The sun!

898
01:13:10,417 --> 01:13:13,580
We can do it!
We can ride it to Tomorrow!

899
01:13:37,577 --> 01:13:38,738
Run!

900
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,138
I don't understand.

901
01:14:09,297 --> 01:14:12,346
The sun was right here.
It was right here.

902
01:14:16,977 --> 01:14:18,581
We have to go back to the cave.

903
01:14:18,777 --> 01:14:20,142
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

904
01:14:20,297 --> 01:14:23,460
Stay together. Let's keep moving.
Move, move, move.

905
01:14:23,657 --> 01:14:25,102
Everybody, hold my hand.

906
01:14:25,257 --> 01:14:27,863
Thunk, let's go. Go, go, go.
Let's stay together.

907
01:14:29,017 --> 01:14:31,145
Grug. What's wrong with you?

908
01:14:31,297 --> 01:14:34,380
Grug, we'll die if we stay here!

909
01:14:58,017 --> 01:15:00,145
Grug, listen to me.

910
01:15:00,297 --> 01:15:02,982
We've got to get back to that cave.

911
01:15:06,337 --> 01:15:08,305
No more dark.

912
01:15:09,017 --> 01:15:11,224
No more hiding.

913
01:15:11,737 --> 01:15:13,705
No more caves.

914
01:15:15,377 --> 01:15:17,379
What's the point of all this?

915
01:15:21,497 --> 01:15:23,864
To follow the light.

916
01:15:27,537 --> 01:15:29,221
I can't change.

917
01:15:29,377 --> 01:15:31,539
I don't have ideas.

918
01:15:32,377 --> 01:15:34,664
But I have my strength.

919
01:15:34,817 --> 01:15:36,182
And right now...

920
01:15:36,337 --> 01:15:38,658
that's all you need.

921
01:15:40,377 --> 01:15:42,948
No, we don't know what's over there.
Maybe nothing!

922
01:15:43,097 --> 01:15:45,065
It's too risky!

923
01:15:47,257 --> 01:15:48,588
It's a chance.

924
01:15:58,217 --> 01:16:00,379
I'll take that chance.

925
01:16:01,777 --> 01:16:05,748
I've wanted to throw you away
ever since I met you.

926
01:16:06,857 --> 01:16:08,746
That's a joke, right?

927
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:10,786
What's a "joke"?

928
01:16:41,137 --> 01:16:42,707
He made it!

929
01:16:44,457 --> 01:16:46,858
He made it.

930
01:16:49,817 --> 01:16:52,058
Okay, Thunk. Your turn.

931
01:16:52,217 --> 01:16:53,742
You're not coming, are you?

932
01:16:54,257 --> 01:16:56,737
When you make it, so will I.

933
01:17:05,057 --> 01:17:06,058
No!

934
01:17:14,657 --> 01:17:16,307
You did good.

935
01:17:18,737 --> 01:17:20,148
Dadda!

936
01:17:32,297 --> 01:17:33,298
Gran...

937
01:17:33,457 --> 01:17:35,619
No mush. Just throw me.

938
01:17:36,377 --> 01:17:37,538
Wait.

939
01:17:37,697 --> 01:17:40,303
You surprised me today...

940
01:17:40,457 --> 01:17:41,902
lunkhead.

941
01:17:47,617 --> 01:17:49,904
Still alive!

942
01:17:50,857 --> 01:17:52,143
Time to go.

943
01:17:52,297 --> 01:17:53,378
No.

944
01:17:53,577 --> 01:17:55,625
I have too much to say to you.

945
01:17:55,777 --> 01:17:58,223
I need to fix everything,
and I don't have time.

946
01:17:58,377 --> 01:18:00,061
I can fix it.

947
01:18:03,817 --> 01:18:05,342
This works good.

948
01:18:06,817 --> 01:18:08,342
What do you call it?

949
01:18:09,177 --> 01:18:12,499
I was thinking of calling it a "hug."

950
01:18:13,617 --> 01:18:15,540
Because it rhymes with "Grug."

951
01:18:17,657 --> 01:18:19,819
But you can change it if you want.

952
01:18:20,777 --> 01:18:23,747
No. I like "hug."

953
01:18:29,617 --> 01:18:30,982
I love you.

954
01:18:34,697 --> 01:18:35,698
I...

955
01:18:41,297 --> 01:18:42,742
Dad...

956
01:18:43,537 --> 01:18:45,221
I'm scared.

957
01:18:45,417 --> 01:18:47,863
Never be afraid.

958
01:19:25,497 --> 01:19:26,623
There!

959
01:19:26,777 --> 01:19:28,063
I see him!

960
01:20:12,857 --> 01:20:13,858
Hey!

961
01:20:14,017 --> 01:20:15,428
Hey, I did it!

962
01:21:37,217 --> 01:21:39,060
Back! Stay back!

963
01:21:39,257 --> 01:21:41,100
Stay back!

964
01:22:25,497 --> 01:22:27,101
They're in trouble.

965
01:22:27,257 --> 01:22:29,578
Hang on, I'm coming!

966
01:22:30,017 --> 01:22:31,746
How do I get across?

967
01:22:31,937 --> 01:22:35,066
I have to think. What would Guy do?

968
01:22:35,217 --> 01:22:37,948
What would Guy do, what would Guy do?

969
01:22:40,137 --> 01:22:42,060
What would I do?

970
01:22:42,897 --> 01:22:44,387
Hold this.

971
01:22:59,777 --> 01:23:03,224
I have...

972
01:23:03,457 --> 01:23:04,001
an idea!

973
01:23:28,617 --> 01:23:29,778
Run!

974
01:24:10,937 --> 01:24:12,302
Yes!

975
01:24:19,777 --> 01:24:20,938
Douglas?

976
01:24:21,457 --> 01:24:23,141
Hey, I know that guy.

977
01:24:58,417 --> 01:25:00,021
Hold on!

978
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:44,541
It's not safe here.

979
01:25:46,577 --> 01:25:48,227
I'll tell her.

980
01:26:36,377 --> 01:26:38,186
I never got to tell him.

981
01:26:40,217 --> 01:26:43,266
Eep, if your dad were here,
he would tell you to...

982
01:26:43,417 --> 01:26:46,500
Get out of the way!

983
01:26:46,657 --> 01:26:48,819
Wow. You sound just like him.

984
01:26:48,977 --> 01:26:52,743
Get out of the way!

985
01:26:52,977 --> 01:26:54,103
Dadda!

986
01:26:54,257 --> 01:26:55,497
He did it!

987
01:26:55,697 --> 01:26:57,108
He's riding the sun.

988
01:26:58,497 --> 01:27:00,340
But, not very well.

989
01:27:00,537 --> 01:27:02,665
Everybody out of the way!

990
01:27:07,897 --> 01:27:09,262
- Dad!
- Grug!

991
01:27:10,297 --> 01:27:12,265
Where's the danger?
Who blew their shell?

992
01:27:14,057 --> 01:27:15,980
I love you, too!

993
01:27:25,097 --> 01:27:27,987
One, two, three, four...

994
01:27:28,137 --> 01:27:29,662
five...

995
01:27:29,857 --> 01:27:30,858
six...

996
01:27:31,937 --> 01:27:34,019
and seven.

997
01:27:36,617 --> 01:27:37,823
And a half.

998
01:27:39,097 --> 01:27:40,622
And eight.

999
01:27:41,497 --> 01:27:42,498
Nine.

1000
01:27:42,657 --> 01:27:44,785
Douglas! Dad, you saved him!

1001
01:27:44,937 --> 01:27:47,383
A boy has to have a pet.

1002
01:27:51,497 --> 01:27:53,943
Turns out I'm a cat person.

1003
01:27:56,497 --> 01:27:57,658
No.

1004
01:28:06,697 --> 01:28:09,985
You really need to see this.

1005
01:28:21,857 --> 01:28:23,541
We should go there.

1006
01:28:24,057 --> 01:28:26,139
Yes! Coming through!

1007
01:28:29,657 --> 01:28:30,658
Wait!

1008
01:28:35,017 --> 01:28:37,987
<i>This is me. My name is Eep.</i>

1009
01:28:38,177 --> 01:28:41,386
<i>And this is my family, the Croods.</i>

1010
01:28:41,537 --> 01:28:43,904
<i>If you weren't clued in
by the suntans and pets...</i>

1011
01:28:44,097 --> 01:28:46,748
<i>we're not exactly cavemen anymore.</i>

1012
01:28:50,097 --> 01:28:52,782
Let's do it again. I think I blinked.

1013
01:28:53,417 --> 01:28:56,341
<i>Our world is still plenty harsh and hostile...</i>

1014
01:28:57,777 --> 01:28:59,905
<i>but now we know the Croods will make it.</i>

1015
01:29:00,057 --> 01:29:02,867
<i>Because we changed the rules...</i>

1016
01:29:03,017 --> 01:29:04,860
<i>the ones that kept us in the dark.</i>

1017
01:29:07,857 --> 01:29:11,782
<i>And because of my dad,
who taught us that anyone can change.</i>

1018
01:29:11,937 --> 01:29:13,621
Release the baby!

1019
01:29:18,897 --> 01:29:20,308
Sort of.

1020
01:29:39,097 --> 01:29:42,385
<i>So, from now on,
we'll stay out here...</i>

1021
01:29:42,577 --> 01:29:44,659
<i>where we can follow the light.</i>
