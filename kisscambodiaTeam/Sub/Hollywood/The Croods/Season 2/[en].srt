- No!

do their jobs and start the fire!

132

Come on, man. Just chill.

Yes! You did it!

142
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,511
Eep would never leave us. No.

143
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,971

144
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,192
No. No!

145
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,444

147
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,249
Eep. Eep, are you awake?

148
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:01,333
Yeah.

149
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,168

No, no. This is a "hey"

156
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,076
So, uh, I was thinking...

157
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,412
That's not my hand.

158
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,083
Anyway, uh...

159
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,961
I couldn't sleep.
I was thinking about Tomorrow.

160

00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,812
What I mean is, um,

163
00:09:51,895 --> 00:09:57,514
maybe our Tomorrow is different
than the rest of... of the pack's.

164
00:09:57,598 --> 00:10:01,476
Maybe our Tomorrow is a place
of our own, you know?

165
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,563
Like a home.
Just the two of us.

166
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,148
Just the two of us?

167
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:10,027
Hmm. Guy, I'd really miss my family.

168
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:14,031
But that does sound amazing!

169
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,532
A place of our own?

170
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,551
Our home?

171
00:10:17,634 --> 00:10:19,620
Ooh! Can our home have flowers?

172
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,246
Sure can. And butterflies.

173
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,831
And a sweet, babbling brook?

174
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:24,499
And privacy.

175
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,293
Ooh! What's "privacy"?

176
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:29,713
It means you only smell the feet
you wanna smell.

177
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,797
Wow.

178
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,716
So, um...

179
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:37,304
do you, Eep Amber Crood,

180
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:40,599
think you could
spend your Tomorrow with me?

181
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:45,312
I do.

182
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:52,069
I'm going to fall asleep
and dream about our home.

183
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,987
- Good night, Guy.
- Good night, Eep.

184
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,034
Just the two of them?

185
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,374
Warping my baby's mind
with whispers and kisses.

186
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:09,378
"Can Grug hear us?"
Oh, yeah, Grug hears. Grug hears all.

187
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:12,005
All about your private
two-person house of Tomorrow,

188
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:15,092
whispering, kissing,
butter-babble-brooking.

189
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,678
What the heck is that?

190
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:28,230
Thunk, make it stop.

191
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:30,440
Hit snooze!

192
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:31,608
Stop it, tummy.

193
00:11:34,488 --> 00:11:36,154
Another glorious morning.

194
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,323
What's that? You wanna play?

195
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:39,575
Go get it, boy!

196
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:40,784
No, Sandy!

197
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,912
Mom! Sandy's fetching
Douglas's stick again.

198
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,542
Uh, what's that?

199
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,044
Kill circle!

200
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,051
Safety off, babe.

201
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,136
Thanks.

202
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:06,143
Today is a good day to die!

203
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,538
Hey, everyone!
You'll never guess what I fo...

204
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:12,983
Oops. Sorry, honey.

205
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,194
We thought you were a predator
trying to kill us.

206
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:17,487
No, never apologize
for an effective kill circle.

207
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:20,365
You have to come see this.
Follow me! Come on. This way.

208
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:21,491
Whoo-hoo!

209
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,452
Yes! You're gonna love it!

210
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,377
- Wow!
- Whoa.

211
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,388
Dun-dun-duh?

212
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:48,143
What is that?

213
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,562
I've never seen anything like it.

214
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,108
What is it, Mom? Make it leave.

215
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,402
There's something about this.

216
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,366
I think it's...
the end of the world.

217
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,618
Looks like I've seen it all.

218
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,522
Well, that's it for me.
I'm glad it's you, Chunky.

219
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:10,958
It's not the end.

220
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,795
It's just the beginning.

221
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:18,048
Welcome to our Tomorrow!

222
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,554
- Whoa.
- Wow!

223
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:24,638
Wow!

224
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:29,935
Look at all this food!

225
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,603
Guy, are you seeing this?

226
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,814
You're the best dad ever!
Let's eat!

227
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,899
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
One moment, Thunk.

228
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:39,069
Before we eat,
I'd like to say a few words.

229
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:43,991
Let this flag mark the day
I discovered our home,

230
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:47,494
filled with flowers,
and butterflies,

231
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:49,162
and a sweet, babbling brook.

232
00:13:50,522 --> 00:13:53,250
Here, right here,
all your needs will be met...

233
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,544
- I'm hungry!
- In a minute!

234
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:56,907
Go now! He's not looking.

235
00:13:58,981 --> 00:14:01,508
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Just a minute. Just a minute. One minute.

236
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,802
No, no, no. Wait, wait.
Just wait.

237
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:07,514
This is our home, a place we'll always
be together forever and ever,

238
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:08,849
and you're welcome!

239
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:12,019
I did this.

240
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:13,353
Problem solved.

241
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:15,939
Whoo-hoo!

242
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:18,442
Food!

243
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:22,112
Isn't it strange how this food
grows in perfectly straight ro...

244
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,075
Whoo-hoo!

245
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,651
I don't feel like eating anymore.

246
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:01,944
Mom, am I sick?

247
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:04,488
No, honey. You're full.

248
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,448
Full feels weird.

249
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:10,244
I can't eat another bite.

250
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,054
Wait.

251
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:16,875
Yes, I can.

252
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,044
Buh-nah-nuh.

253
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,379
Banana?

254
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:24,174
I tasted one once, long, long ago.

255
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:28,178
It was summer.
The sun was warm on my shoulders.

256
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,389
Flowers were in high bloom.

257
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:32,266
I was just a cub.

258
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:36,228
Well, I ate that banana in one bite.

259
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:40,858
And ever since, a day hasn't gone by
without me thinking about it.

260
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,861
What was it like, Father?
What was it like?

261
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,946
No words can describe it, Thunk.

262
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,283
No words are good enough.

263
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:52,870
We get it, Dad.
Just grab the banana!

264
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:54,847
Come here, sweet thing.

265
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:16,518
Do you guys hear that?

266
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,058
What is that?

267
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,693
What's happening? I can't see.

268
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:26,904
It's getting closer!

269
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:29,256
Kill circle?

270
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,953
Something got over the wall.

271
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:36,121
Don't get too close.

272
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:39,875
Who knows what kind of weird
beyond-the-wall creatures they are.

273
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,169
Let's just jab at them from afar.

274
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:43,504
- Jab!
- Ow!

275
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:44,922
Jab, jab!

276
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,342
Wait a moment.

277
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:51,553
Look past the matted pelts
and gnashing teeth.

278
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:55,082
The eyes,
there's a kind of humanity in them.

279
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,476
Ba-na-na.

280
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,520
It's trying to communicate.

281
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:01,980
Hope, these are people!

282
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,818
Cave people.

283
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:09,488
I thought cave people
died off years ago.

284
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:19,957
We happy meet you.

285
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,084
In hearts...

286
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,712
...much joy.

287
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:28,966
- Thanks.
- Much joy to you too.

288
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,301
Oh. They speak beautifully.

289
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:34,263
Oh, forgive our condescension, friend.

290
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:35,347
I'm Phil.

291
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,290
And I am Hope. And we are...

292
00:17:38,373 --> 00:17:39,476
The Bettermans.

293
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,395
"Better man"?

294
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:43,313
- Betterman.
- Emphasis on the "better."

295
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:45,482
Well, we're the Croods.

296
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,234
- And this is...
- Guy?

297
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,444
Wow. Good guess.

298
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:51,905
Mr. and Mrs. Betterman?

299
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:53,907
- Guy!
- What-What's going on here?

300
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:55,951
- Oh, Guy.
- Guy. Guy!

301
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,828
Hope, it's Guy.

302
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,580
Guy, Guy, Guy.

303
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:01,206
What's going on here?

304
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,168
I grew up with Hope and Phil.

305
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,837
They were
my parents' best friends until...

306
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,963
Oh, Guy.

307
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,632
We thought we lost your whole family.

308
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:15,012
That was the moment we realized,
in such a dangerous world,

309
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,723
there had to be
a better way to live.

310
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:20,893
Wha...

311
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:22,311
Is that your home?

312
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:24,730
Whoa! That's their home!

313
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,857
- Whoa, mama!
- Look, Dad!

314
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,859
Wow.

315
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,611
Hey, Guy, race you to the top.

316
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:35,157
Oh, um, excuse me, little tiger girl?

317
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,618
- Uh, we don't climb this tree.
- Huh?

318
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:40,537
- There's a "Betterman" way.
- Unofficial motto.

319
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,881
- Ooh.
- Okay, everybody in?

320
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:44,166
Ah!

321
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,420
Yeah, the, um, death cat
will have to stay outside.

322
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:50,631
See ya, Chunky.

323
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:53,008
Sorry. Animals track in too much...

324
00:18:53,562 --> 00:18:55,636
um, dirt.

325
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:56,803
Going up.

326
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,805
Whoa! What's happening?

327
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:02,414
Oh.

328
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:06,772
Welcome to the Betterman home!

329
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:07,981
Wow!

330
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:09,358
It's beautiful!

331
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:11,318
Kind of big, isn't it?

332
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:13,570
What?

333
00:19:14,054 --> 00:19:18,559
Whoa! I can see the clouds!
But I'm inside.

334
00:19:18,642 --> 00:19:20,869
What is this? What is this?

335
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:23,664
Uh, we call that a window.

336
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:26,708
Window.

337
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:29,711
Okay.

338
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:32,798
Guy, Dawn will be
so happy to see you.

339
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,174
- Dawn?
- Dawn?

340
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:35,801
Yeah, yeah. We grew up together.

341
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,469
Oh, Dawn!

342
00:19:38,754 --> 00:19:40,562
Oh. That's just your reflection.

343
00:19:40,657 --> 00:19:42,016
It's called a mirror.

344
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:43,350
Oh, sorry.

345
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:44,476
Dawn!

346
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:47,563
- Sorry.
- Dawn!

347
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,189
Where is she?

348
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:51,817
- I'm in the panic cubby!
- Panic cubby!

349
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,528
Dawn, it wasn't wild animals.

350
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:56,154
It's safe to come out.

351
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:03,078
Mom, maybe we should drill some air holes
in the door of the panic cubby?

352
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:05,247
No air holes.
Snakes could get in.

353
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,583
But you'll never believe
who we just found.

354
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:10,335
- Guy?
- Dawn?

355
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:12,671
Guy! Is it really you?

356
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,089
It's you! You're here!

357
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:18,010
You're so old! So are you!
That's what I said!

358
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,094
Oh, together again.

359
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:21,930
These two were inseparable
when they were young.

360
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:23,724
Inseparable.

361
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,309
Dawn's a girl?

362
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:30,314
Hold on, stop.
You accessorize with a sloth?

363
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:33,150
I accessorize with a sloth!
This is Belt!

364
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:38,155
- Mine's Sash.
- Ooh la la.

365
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,157
Oh, oh! These are the Croods.

366
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,241
- Hello.
- Hey.

367
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:42,910
- 'Sup?
- And this...

368
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:44,411
Wait. Nope, nope.

369
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:45,871
Yeah. This is Eep.

370
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,748
- You're a girl?
- Yeah.

371
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:50,375
A girl friend!

372
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:52,628
I've never had a girlfriend before!

373
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:54,107
- Me either! Me either!
- Girlfriends!

374
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:56,965
- Okay, careful! Small bones.
- Extra vertebrae!

375
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:58,550
- This is amazing!
- What do we do?

376
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:00,812
- What do we say to each other?
- What's happening to our voices?

377
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:03,347
Why are our voices getting so high?

378
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:11,920
As our houseguests,
you're welcome to anything you want.

379
00:21:12,483 --> 00:21:14,718
I know what I want.

380
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:18,070
Uh, except for that.

381
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:19,988
But there's so many of them.

382
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:21,198
Uh, sorry, Grug.

383
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:24,159
I'm afraid we have
one house rule here.

384
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:25,577
We don't eat the bananas.

385
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:26,787
But they're right here.

386
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,873
Anything else, anything at all,
is yours to enjoy.

387
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:32,960
But we don't eat the bananas.

388
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:35,128
- Really?
- Heh?

389
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:37,422
- No bananas?
- Heh?

390
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:38,507
But...

391
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,467
We won't eat your bananas.

392
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:42,769
It's getting late, so...

393
00:21:42,853 --> 00:21:44,972
Well, we can just sleep-pile
right here.

394
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:47,182
Got it. Solid spot, Dad.

395
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:49,893
Look, Phil. They sleep in a pile.

396
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:51,895
- Ooh, fun!
- Nuh-uh.

397
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:54,857
Actually,
everyone gets their own rooms.

398
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,401
We get separate rooms!

399
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:59,528
- What's a room?
- What's a separate?

400
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:02,573
We Bettermans believe
that privacy promotes individuality.

401
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:04,032
Unofficial motto.

402
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:08,412
Well, we Croods believe that
the pack sticks together no matter...

403
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:09,396
What?

404
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,390
Tell me about my room,
Mr. Better-dad.

405
00:22:11,473 --> 00:22:13,292
Well, son, it's right this way.

406
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,378
It all started
with a tree and an idea.

407
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,051
Wow. What a day.

408
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:25,554
I never thought
I'd see the Bettermans again.

409
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:26,947
- Hey, you!
- Hey.

410
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,931
Wow.

411
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:30,434
Sure beats the view
from any cave I know.

412
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:32,269
Yeah,
I can't believe this place.

413
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:37,858
Oh, this bed is so comfortable.

414
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:40,594
Ah, nobody's foot in my mouth.

415
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:43,280
So much better.

416
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,115
Yeah.

417
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:51,371
So, is this that privacy thing
you were telling me about?

418
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:52,956
Just feels kind of...

419
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:55,709
far... you know?

420
00:22:57,336 --> 00:22:58,337
Guy?

421
00:22:58,837 --> 00:22:59,838
Guy?

422
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:02,758
Guy?

423
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:08,289
Time to watch
some late-night window.

424
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:11,767
Ooh, ooh. Check it out, Douglas.
This guy's my favorite.

425
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:16,522
Okay, moommoth.
Whatcha gonna do now?

426
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,734
Oh! What an idiot!

427
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:36,375
Ugga?

428
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:39,545
Ugga.

429
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:44,800
- Ugga!
- Kill circle!

430
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:47,469
Oh. Hey, honey.

431
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:49,221
Yeah, I couldn't sleep either.

432
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:52,599
All these separate rooms.
Who could live in a place like this?

433
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:53,684
Well...

434
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:57,271
And there's something off about that
Phil Betterman guy. Like, way off.

435
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:59,356
Grug, you know what I think?

436
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,275
Maybe we could stay.

437
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,944
Excuse me?
You're thinking about staying here?

438
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:07,698
No. I want to be in the wild
fighting vulture rats for scraps.

439
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:09,501
- Of course I want to stay.
- Yeah, but...

440
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:10,951
- It's nice here.
- But...

441
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:14,049
And you were just worried about
your daughter leaving,

442
00:24:14,132 --> 00:24:16,685
but the pack is together.

443
00:24:16,848 --> 00:24:17,899
Sort of.

444
00:24:17,983 --> 00:24:21,285
If you give this place a chance,
you might actually like it here.

445
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:25,257
Do I have to like Phil?

446
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,676
You have to be nice. No hitting.

447
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,636
Okay.

448
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,638
But if I have to be alone...

449
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:35,809
I'm gonna be alone with you.

450
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:39,104
I mean, can you believe it?

451
00:24:39,188 --> 00:24:43,275
After all these years,
and Guy shows up on our doorstep.

452
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:47,237
And to think that we were worrying
about Dawn being alone.

453
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:48,572
And now Guy's back!

454
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:50,782
It's like fate
brought them back together.

455
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:52,659
Like it was meant to be.

456
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:57,539
But did you see the way
that cave girl was holding Guy's hand?

457
00:24:57,623 --> 00:24:58,457
Hmm.

458
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:02,252
You don't think Guy could possibly
be serious about that Meep?

459
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:03,962
Or "Peep"? Or is it "Eep"?

460
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:05,297
"Eep." It's "Eep," right?

461
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,426
Well, I'm just not sure
Eep fits in here. You know?

462
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,054
In fact, none of them do.

463
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:16,350
Poor things do seem to struggle
with the concept of walls.

464
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:19,561
I don't know if cave people
belong in a modern world.

465
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:21,438
Aah!

466
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:23,815
I'm going to watch window forever!

467
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:25,776
Do they know that?

468
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,570
I feel like we just need to
help them understand

469
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:30,697
that they have a bright future...

470
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:32,324
outside these walls.

471
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:37,913
And Guy's future is inside the walls.

472
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:39,748
With Dawn.

473
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:42,543
Hope Betterman,
always thinking of others.

474
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:44,586
Honestly, I just can't help it.

475
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,888
Ooh, that was...

476
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:57,724
...hands down,
the best night's sleep I've gotten in...

477
00:25:57,808 --> 00:25:59,059
- Morning, Guy!
- Oh!

478
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:00,227
Hi, Mr. Betterman.

479
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,562
Fresh bitter bean juice?

480
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:04,189
Uh, thank you?

481
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:06,233
- Hi, Guy!
- Ah! Mrs. Betterman.

482
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:08,694
These are for you.
I made them last night.

483
00:26:11,812 --> 00:26:13,574
Oh, uh, I should wake Eep up.

484
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:16,535
You know, it's been seven hours
since I said, uh, "Hey."

485
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:18,453
That's adorable!

486
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:22,040
You know, let's let that poor Eep sleep.
She must be exhausted.

487
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:24,209
- Nah, I'm sure she's...
- Oh, look!

488
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:27,004
Here's Dawn!
What a coincidence.

489
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:30,632
Why, Dawn, whatever are you doing
on this particular rope bridge

490
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:33,218
at this particular moment in time?

491
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:36,346
My morning chores?

492
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,056
Morning chores!

493
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:52,279
Genius.

494
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:58,160
Genius!

495
00:26:58,243 --> 00:26:59,369
Genius!

496
00:27:00,245 --> 00:27:01,330
Genius!

497
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:03,832
Genius! Genius! Genius!

498
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:07,878
Genius.

499
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:14,593
Genius. Mmm.

500
00:27:20,362 --> 00:27:22,067
- Boom.
- Boom.

501
00:27:22,151 --> 00:27:24,019
Couldn't sleep last night.

502
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:25,354
Me neither.

503
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:27,481
When I woke up,
your mom was missing.

504
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:29,900
You don't think
a predator took her, do you?

505
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:31,443
Nope. Found her.

506
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:37,533
It's like this place
is changing everyone.

507
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:40,619
We don't sleep-pile anymore.
We don't wake up together.

508
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:43,455
And Thunk just stares at that box.

509
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:44,915
Ohh.

510
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:47,668
Not now, Douglas. The birds are on.

511
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:51,213
Dad, relax.
It's been one night.

512
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:53,590
And a little change can be... Guy?

513
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:58,554
- Hey.
- Guy?

514
00:27:58,637 --> 00:28:02,558
Wow. You're you,
but you don't look like you.

515
00:28:04,425 --> 00:28:06,019
And you smell like flowers.

516
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:07,646
And soft rain.

517
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,857
More like a clear mountain stream.

518
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,775
With just a hint of vanilla.

519
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:14,444
It's called a shower.
You should try it.

520
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,406
You want me to smell like vanilla?

521
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:18,657
Just a hint.

522
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,367
What happened to your clothes?

523
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,578
We burned his clothes
while he was in the shower.

524
00:28:22,661 --> 00:28:26,790
In fact, they were so dirty
that we washed them and then burned them.

525
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:35,007
Come on, Thunk.
We're going outside.

526
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,342
I don't wanna.
I'm watching birds.

527
00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:40,387
In my day, we didn't stare at birds.
We fought them.

528
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,847
Let me live my life!

529
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,932
Hey, new friend girl!
Want some breakfast?

530
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:45,309
Uh, sure!

531
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:47,060
Oh! I'll start the fire again.

532
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:48,187
Fire.

533
00:28:52,033 --> 00:28:53,150
Hey.

534
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:54,693
Hey, yeah. Check this out.

535
00:28:58,447 --> 00:29:01,909
Now, that's how you make a fire.
You don't need two people anymore.

536
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:05,204
I can't believe how much time
I wasted clacking rocks. This is amazing!

537
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:08,457
And it's such a time-saver,
and it's so simple.

538
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,000
No more smashed fingers.

539
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:11,543
The Bettermans really do...

540
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:25,349
Oh, there you are.
I was looking all over for you.

541
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:28,727
Whoa. We are really up here!

542
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:31,480
Do I smell weird to you?

543
00:29:32,622 --> 00:29:34,525
You smell... different.

544
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:36,360
Like river rocks with, uh...

545
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:39,154
a hint of moss.

546
00:29:40,197 --> 00:29:42,007
Whoa!
What's that mark on your wrist?

547
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,784
Oh, it's just a scar.

548
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:44,868
Scar?

549
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:47,412
Yeah, from a thorned crab.
No big deal.

550
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:49,081
Whoa! And that?

551
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:50,707
Razor worm.

552
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:52,751
- Well, what about that one?
- Scorpion badger.

553
00:29:52,835 --> 00:29:55,379
Swamp snake,
sky snake, volcano,

554
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:56,630
end of the world,

555
00:29:56,713 --> 00:30:00,050
my little sister, my little sister,
my little sister. She bites a lot.

556
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:02,803
And my dad doesn't even know
about this one.

557
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:06,098
Whoa. Peanut toe.

558
00:30:07,266 --> 00:30:10,085
Every mark is an adventure!

559
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:12,855
My parents won't
even let me have scars.

560
00:30:12,938 --> 00:30:15,899
That's why they built the wall.
To keep me safe.

561
00:30:18,861 --> 00:30:20,863
You're not allowed outside the wall?

562
00:30:20,946 --> 00:30:24,366
Nope, not since
what happened to Guy's family.

563
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:27,828
So, this farm...

564
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,831
is like your cave.

565
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:32,416
You're just like me!

566
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:34,751
Come on.

567
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:39,381
Oh, man. Is this your ride?

568
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:40,924
Nah, it's my dad's.

569
00:30:46,129 --> 00:30:48,015
Listen to this baby purr.

570
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:50,622
- See that pig gator over there?
- Yeah.

571
00:30:50,706 --> 00:30:52,561
- Wanna jump it?
- Yeah.

572
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:56,440
Whoo!

573
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:58,747
- See that chicken seal over there?
- Yeah.

574
00:30:58,851 --> 00:31:00,080
- Wanna jump it?
- Yeah!

575
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:01,987
Whoo!

576
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,947
- You see that wall?
- Yeah!

577
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:05,991
- Wanna jump it?
- Yeah!

578
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:09,161
No! Eep, I'm not allowed
to go outside the wall!

579
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:11,997
Don't worry.
We'll be back before anyone knows.

580
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:30,507
Are you okay?

581
00:31:30,591 --> 00:31:32,809
Whoo-hoo!

582
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:36,563
Oh, my gosh! My heart is pounding!
I feel so alive!

583
00:31:37,314 --> 00:31:39,900
Let's jump more stuff.

584
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:43,695
Whoo!

585
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:46,365
Ready?

586
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:47,449
Let's do it.

587
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:50,953
Yeah!

588
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:52,955
Again! Something bigger!

589
00:31:54,814 --> 00:31:56,375
Oh! Mrs. Betterman.

590
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:59,169
We were just checking out this invention.
What's it for?

591
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:01,880
Um... It... W...

592
00:32:01,964 --> 00:32:03,799
You know, why don't you ask Phil?

593
00:32:03,882 --> 00:32:06,593
He spends a lot of time in there.

594
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:09,012
Anyway, here.

595
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:10,973
I thought you might want to have this.

596
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:13,684
It's some old pictures of our families.

597
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:16,687
Oh.

598
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:17,955
Thank you.

599
00:32:18,939 --> 00:32:21,608
Whoa!

600
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:23,652
Where does this go?

601
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:28,156
Dad, what if I miss something?
I wanna go back inside.

602
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,275
No, Thunk.

603
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,451
Play with Douglas.
He's feeling left out.

604
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:34,788
And he's sad that everyone isn't
spending time together anymore.

605
00:32:37,165 --> 00:32:39,293
All right.
You wanna play fetch, Douglas?

606
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:42,796
Yeah? Okay. Okay. Go get it!

607
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:44,840
Oh!

608
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:47,259
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

609
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:49,344
I'm going back to the window!

610
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:53,390
Hey! There he is!

611
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:56,435
Grug! Over here, buddy.

612
00:32:56,518 --> 00:32:58,312
Let's go for a ride.

613
00:32:58,395 --> 00:33:00,397
Grug. Gruggers.

614
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,565
G-G-G-Grug.

615
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:02,649
Grug.

616
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:06,236
Grug? Grug.

617
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,030
Wanna go for that ride?

618
00:33:08,113 --> 00:33:09,907
Pretty impressive, eh, Grug?

619
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,241
Funny story,

620
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:16,997
everything you see before you used to be
a sad, hopeless, dust-filled wasteland.

621
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,498
That doesn't sound funny.

622
00:33:18,582 --> 00:33:20,834
But through
the power of higher thought,

623
00:33:20,918 --> 00:33:25,297
I devised a way to get all the water
from that high mountain source

624
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,507
to flow down here.

625
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,799
How interesting.

626
00:33:27,883 --> 00:33:31,428
Yup, I turned a barren desert
into a lush oasis.

627
00:33:31,512 --> 00:33:33,972
Now we have all the water we need
and then some.

628
00:33:34,056 --> 00:33:36,475
Matter of fact, we're thinking of
putting in a new...

629
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:38,435
- Ooh, banana.
- No!

630
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:39,528
Ow.

631
00:33:39,611 --> 00:33:40,938
What'd you do that for?

632
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:44,525
Sorry. I'm afraid I must remind you
of our one rule.

633
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:46,360
We don't eat the bananas.

634
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:49,696
Well, why not?
I mean, they're everywhere!

635
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:53,116
Look! You got a whole bowl full of them
over there. Who are those for?

636
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,577
Grug, we could talk about fruit all day.

637
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:56,870
Or...

638
00:33:56,954 --> 00:33:59,164
do you wanna see
something really cool?

639
00:33:59,248 --> 00:34:00,499
I don't know.

640
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:16,639
Hey. Fixing yourself a snack?

641
00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:20,686
Oh, I thought I'd clean up a little.
Noticed we made a bit of a mess yesterday.

642
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:24,690
Oh, no. I hadn't noticed.

643
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:27,693
Um, you can just put that over there
in the compost bin.

644
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:29,777
Oh, smart.

645
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:34,574
Good job.

646
00:34:34,658 --> 00:34:38,161
Well, we didn't want you to think
we're a family of savages.

647
00:34:39,955 --> 00:34:41,831
Savages.

648
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:43,750
Sandy, drop it.

649
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,210
Drop it!

650
00:34:46,295 --> 00:34:48,088
Kids, right?

651
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:51,382
So, Ugga,
you must really miss the wild.

652
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:53,844
- Right? With the hunting...
- Not really.

653
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:56,263
- ...and the gathering...
- Not really.

654
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:58,182
...the baying at the moon.

655
00:34:59,558 --> 00:35:00,893
Not at all.

656
00:35:00,976 --> 00:35:03,604
Honestly, it sucks out there.

657
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:07,441
If no one's died before breakfast,
it's a win.

658
00:35:07,524 --> 00:35:10,277
It is so much better in here.

659
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,570
Oh.

660
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:12,821
That's nice.

661
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:15,449
Yeah.

662
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:19,336
Actually, Grug and I were thinking
that maybe we...

663
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:22,289
Ah! I almost forgot.
I made this for you.

664
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:23,832
- A basket?
- Mm-hmm.

665
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:26,877
Well, it's more like-like
a travel basket.

666
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,337
Travel basket?

667
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,838
Yeah, for the road.

668
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:34,301
It's got fruit, nuts, soap, more soap
and a neck pillow.

669
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:38,639
Oh. Yeah. This'll be great...
for the road.

670
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:40,389
Thank you.

671
00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:43,840
It's the least we can do
to thank you for bringing Guy home.

672
00:35:43,894 --> 00:35:45,187
- Home?
- Home.

673
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,271
Guy?

674
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:47,689
Guy's home. You got it.

675
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:49,858
Well, gotta go.
See you at dinner, okay?

676
00:35:56,356 --> 00:35:58,575
Yeah!

677
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:04,414
Ooh!

678
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:06,250
Huh? Whoa!

679
00:36:08,452 --> 00:36:12,047
Whoa.

680
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:15,384
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

681
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:18,554
Yeah!

682
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:24,101
Whoa!

683
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:37,906
Ooh!

684
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:40,951
Ahh! Eep!

685
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:45,622
Eep?

686
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:06,310
I have a scar.

687
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:07,436
You have a scar!

688
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:09,271
- I have a scar!
- Yeah!

689
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:10,522
Ow!

690
00:37:14,717 --> 00:37:16,278
Don't tell Mrs. Betterman,

691
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:19,948
but while she thinks
I'm toiling in the hot sun,

692
00:37:20,032 --> 00:37:21,867
I'm actually in here,

693
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,768
my man cave.

694
00:37:25,294 --> 00:37:26,580
It's hot in here.

695
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:30,626
Grug, you might be more comfortable
if you removed your fur pelt.

696
00:37:30,709 --> 00:37:32,144
I-I already did.

697
00:37:32,878 --> 00:37:33,879
Right.

698
00:37:33,962 --> 00:37:38,550
Yeah, it's a place a father
can escape the chaos of family life.

699
00:37:38,634 --> 00:37:41,136
Relax, hang with his bros,

700
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,722
if bros he has.

701
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:45,290
Another shark milk?

702
00:37:45,474 --> 00:37:50,145
So, you come in here
to hide from your family?

703
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:53,690
Not hide, help. I help my family.

704
00:37:57,486 --> 00:38:01,865
So, uh, how does this
help your family?

705
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:03,325
Yeah.

706
00:38:03,408 --> 00:38:07,829
This is where I find solutions
to my family's biggest problems.

707
00:38:09,248 --> 00:38:10,415
Okay.

708
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:14,044
So, feeling relaxed?
Comfortable?

709
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:16,547
Susceptible to suggestion?

710
00:38:18,507 --> 00:38:20,092
What's your problem, big guy?

711
00:38:20,175 --> 00:38:22,177
I don't have a problem.

712
00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:24,721
Come on, Grug.
I've seen you moping around.

713
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:25,848
What's your problem?

714
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:27,933
I'm hot. That-That's my problem.

715
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:29,393
Knock, knock.

716
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:32,688
I'm knocking on the door, big guy.
Open it.

717
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:34,439
No.

718
00:38:34,523 --> 00:38:36,775
- Open up to me.
- No.

719
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:40,028
- Share with me.
- Uh-uh. I don't wanna. I'm hot.

720
00:38:40,112 --> 00:38:41,405
Tell me your problem.

721
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:42,906
I don't have a problem.

722
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,449
You have a problem.

723
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:46,743
Tell me your problem.

724
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:48,161
- I don't...
- Tell me.

725
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:49,121
- I don't...
- Tell me.

726
00:38:49,204 --> 00:38:50,539
- I don't...
- Tell me. Tell me.

727
00:38:50,622 --> 00:38:52,708
I don't like it here, all right?

728
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:55,586
My pack's all split up.
There's no one to sleep-pile with.

729
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:57,754
You won't let me eat bananas.

730
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:00,632
Guy gave Eep a rock.
He kissed my hand.

731
00:39:00,716 --> 00:39:02,843
They're planning on leaving the pack.

732
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:04,428
And I don't like you at all!

733
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:06,638
Hmm. Now, that's interesting.

734
00:39:06,722 --> 00:39:09,808
You know, maybe I just
need to get to know you better.

735
00:39:09,892 --> 00:39:12,853
No, not that.
The part about Eep and Guy.

736
00:39:12,936 --> 00:39:16,064
Oh. Guy's trying to take
my daughter away.

737
00:39:16,148 --> 00:39:19,276
Father to father,
I worry about my daughter too.

738
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,112
She was so lonely
before Guy came back.

739
00:39:22,196 --> 00:39:23,322
Yeah.

740
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:25,908
It's almost like Guy's the problem.

741
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:29,328
Wait a minute. Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

742
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:31,205
Yes. No.

743
00:39:31,288 --> 00:39:32,873
I don't know. Hot.

744
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:34,625
Are you suggesting...

745
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:38,378
...we take Guy off your hands
so Dawn isn't lonely,

746
00:39:38,462 --> 00:39:41,381
and Eep stays with you,
with your pack?

747
00:39:42,282 --> 00:39:44,218
Uh, am I?

748
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:47,262
Why, Grug?
That's a truly great idea.

749
00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:49,932
You've done it!
You've solved both our problems.

750
00:39:50,474 --> 00:39:53,060
No. Really?

751
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:54,770
So, we have a deal, bro?

752
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,523
Deal.

753
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:06,198
Hey, Ugga!
I just had the best time with Phil!

754
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:09,409
Look at me.
Standing up straight, got lots of ideas.

755
00:40:09,493 --> 00:40:11,078
You know, Phil's a good listener.

756
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:14,456
He knows a smart idea
when he hears... one.

757
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:22,756
The Bettermans want us
to leave without Guy.

758
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,134
- Oh, um... You think so, huh?
- As if we would ever do that.

759
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:28,136
- Well...
- Guy's a member of our pack.

760
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,221
Kind of.

761
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:32,599
And can you imagine what that would do
to Eep? It would absolutely destroy her!

762
00:40:32,683 --> 00:40:34,042
Well, initially.

763
00:40:34,126 --> 00:40:36,228
They think we're just
simple cave people.

764
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:39,481
That we're so stupid,
we'd trade Guy for a fruit basket.

765
00:40:40,315 --> 00:40:43,151
And then she tried to
make me think it was my idea!

766
00:40:43,235 --> 00:40:46,446
- <i>That is a great idea.</i>
- Betterman.

767
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,365
As if we'd ever do that!

768
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:50,617
- <i>So we have a deal?</i>
- Betterman.

769
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:52,703
They must think
we're pretty stupid.

770
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:55,831
<i>You've done it, Grug. Thinking man.
You're not stupid.</i>

771
00:40:55,914 --> 00:40:57,457
- Betterman!
- Betterman!

772
00:40:58,166 --> 00:40:59,751
- Betterman!
- Betterman!

773
00:41:00,669 --> 00:41:02,963
Betterman!

774
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:08,927
Maybe we should
take it down a notch, honey.

775
00:41:10,576 --> 00:41:14,141
We gotta focus. We've gotta get Guy
and get out of here.

776
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:15,851
Okay. But first,

777
00:41:15,944 --> 00:41:20,355
there's something I've wanted to do
for a really, really long time.

778
00:41:24,985 --> 00:41:28,614
Ah. I can't believe they kept
these old picture albums.

779
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:30,490
That's the Bettermans.

780
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:34,453
Okay, this is my mom,
this is my dad, and that's me.

781
00:41:35,996 --> 00:41:38,073
Yeah, I get it. I was skinny.

782
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:44,713
It's pretty great here, huh, Belt?

783
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:48,300
Shh!

784
00:41:55,307 --> 00:41:57,935
Whee!

785
00:41:58,018 --> 00:42:00,270
Shh.

786
00:42:02,231 --> 00:42:04,733
Is that my dad? Hide me!

787
00:42:04,816 --> 00:42:06,026
Mr. Betterman?

788
00:42:07,486 --> 00:42:08,612
"Mr. Betterman"?

789
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:12,282
It's just Guy. Hi, Guy!

790
00:42:12,366 --> 00:42:13,575
Hey, you.

791
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:16,078
- Where'd you go?
- Took Chunky for a joyride.

792
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:18,288
- Joyride!
- Joyride?

793
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:19,831
We rolled the death...

794
00:42:19,915 --> 00:42:21,333
- Outside the wall.
- ...cat!

795
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:24,737
You took Dawn for a joyride

796
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,630
- outside the wall?
- Yeah.

797
00:42:26,713 --> 00:42:28,882
The Bettermans don't want Dawn
outside the wall.

798
00:42:28,966 --> 00:42:32,386
They built the wall for a reason,
you know, to keep everyone safe.

799
00:42:32,469 --> 00:42:33,804
Guy, relax.

800
00:42:33,887 --> 00:42:37,516
Yeah, Guy, take it down low.

801
00:42:38,267 --> 00:42:39,309
What's wrong with her?

802
00:42:39,393 --> 00:42:41,144
It's just a reaction to the bee venom.

803
00:42:41,228 --> 00:42:43,438
- Bee venom?
- Bee venom!

804
00:42:43,522 --> 00:42:44,648
What the...

805
00:42:45,774 --> 00:42:47,609
- It's just a little bee sting.
- "Little"?

806
00:42:47,693 --> 00:42:50,696
Hey, you're not the boss of me.

807
00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:51,905
This is a very severe...

808
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:53,282
Shh.

809
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:56,243
Eep, this is a very severe bee sting!

810
00:42:56,326 --> 00:42:58,453
- "This is a very severe bee sting."
- She's fine.

811
00:42:58,537 --> 00:42:59,830
No, no. She's not fine.

812
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:01,582
- I'm fine.
- Dawn!

813
00:43:01,665 --> 00:43:05,377
Eep, that was not smart.
She could have been seriously hurt.

814
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,379
You gotta think about these things!

815
00:43:07,462 --> 00:43:10,048
Why are you acting like this?
You like adventures.

816
00:43:10,132 --> 00:43:13,635
No! No. I like not dying.
Things are different now.

817
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:15,888
But she needed to get out.

818
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:18,557
She's just like me.
This is her cave!

819
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,185
No, she's not like you.
This is not her cave!

820
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:22,644
She's not a cave girl.

821
00:43:24,605 --> 00:43:26,023
"Cave girl"?

822
00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:33,447
What does he mean by "cave girl"?

823
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:35,324
I'll give him a cave girl!

824
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:46,251
I trust you've all brought
your appetites.

825
00:43:46,335 --> 00:43:48,504
Chef Hope's been working hard all day.

826
00:43:48,587 --> 00:43:51,632
Mmm.
This is so good, Mrs. Better-mom.

827
00:43:52,216 --> 00:43:54,468
You're eating the flower arrangement.

828
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:58,013
Wow.

829
00:43:58,096 --> 00:44:00,933
Uh, Grug, Ugga,
what can we offer you?

830
00:44:01,016 --> 00:44:02,142
Ah, we're good.

831
00:44:02,226 --> 00:44:04,811
Yeah, we ate a little something
on the way over.

832
00:44:04,895 --> 00:44:06,939
Oops. Pardon me.

833
00:44:08,482 --> 00:44:09,608
Okay.

834
00:44:09,691 --> 00:44:10,692
Oh, look!

835
00:44:10,776 --> 00:44:12,945
- Oh!
- Guy and Dawn are here...

836
00:44:13,028 --> 00:44:14,780
...together.

837
00:44:16,648 --> 00:44:17,824
You good to do this?

838
00:44:17,908 --> 00:44:19,912
Just try to keep your giant hand
out of sight.

839
00:44:19,995 --> 00:44:21,119
- Gotcha!
- Ah!

840
00:44:26,066 --> 00:44:29,044
Oh, welcome, Eep.
Your seat is over here, next to...

841
00:44:29,127 --> 00:44:30,128
Gran.

842
00:44:31,922 --> 00:44:34,800
We're not done.
You called me a cave girl.

843
00:44:34,883 --> 00:44:37,553
But y-y-you are a cave girl.

844
00:44:38,929 --> 00:44:42,015
But you said "cave girl"
like it's a bad thing.

845
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:45,169
What's wrong with cave people, Guy?

846
00:44:45,252 --> 00:44:47,104
There's nothing wrong
with cave people.

847
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:49,067
Can I get you a towel
or a utensil or something?

848
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:53,010
I'm good.

849
00:44:53,093 --> 00:44:54,428
Why are you acting like this?

850
00:44:54,511 --> 00:44:56,530
I'm just acting like a cave girl, Guy.

851
00:44:56,613 --> 00:44:58,615
But I guess that's not good enough
for you anymore.

852
00:44:58,699 --> 00:44:59,741
I never said that.

853
00:44:59,825 --> 00:45:02,578
Grug, let's take this moment
to talk about your great idea.

854
00:45:02,661 --> 00:45:03,745
Uh, what?

855
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:05,622
Grug felt, and I concurred,

856
00:45:05,706 --> 00:45:09,001
that Guy should be
with his kind of people, evolved people.

857
00:45:09,084 --> 00:45:10,794
And Eep should stay with her kind.

858
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:13,839
- So we made a deal.
- Say again?

859
00:45:13,922 --> 00:45:15,065
- What deal?
- His deal!

860
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:17,801
- Your idea.
- Your idea?

861
00:45:17,885 --> 00:45:20,304
Guy stays with us,
and Eep stays with her pack.

862
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:21,680
Grug's words, not mine.

863
00:45:21,763 --> 00:45:23,999
- You tried to get rid of me?
- Really, Dad?

864
00:45:24,083 --> 00:45:25,601
No! Honey, I don't think that.

865
00:45:25,684 --> 00:45:27,978
I mean, he made me think
that I thought that.

866
00:45:28,061 --> 00:45:29,479
He tricked me!

867
00:45:29,563 --> 00:45:31,607
He took me
into his stupid secret man cave,

868
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:32,983
and he tricked me.

869
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:34,401
What's a man cave?

870
00:45:34,484 --> 00:45:37,196
It's a place I go to get away.

871
00:45:37,279 --> 00:45:38,488
Away from what?

872
00:45:38,572 --> 00:45:40,574
Away from you! Duh!

873
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:42,743
- What?
- We're all thinking it.

874
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:44,703
- How dare you?
- How dare you!

875
00:45:44,786 --> 00:45:46,246
How dare the both of you!

876
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:48,832
You're trying to fix me up with Guy?

877
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:50,334
What happened to your hand?

878
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:52,211
Oh. I got stung by a bee. Oh!

879
00:45:52,294 --> 00:45:53,921
Outside the wall. Oh!

880
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:56,423
- You went outside the wall?
- Outside the wall?

881
00:45:56,507 --> 00:45:58,717
- This is all your fault!
- Oh! Our fault?

882
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,801
Can I say something?

883
00:45:59,885 --> 00:46:01,011
- No!
- Okay.

884
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:03,180
I can't believe
you actually made that deal.

885
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,724
- What did they do to you?
- I got scars.

886
00:46:05,807 --> 00:46:07,017
Our baby!

887
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,477
It was really hot.

888
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,355
I was full of shark milk.
I was naked!

889
00:46:11,438 --> 00:46:13,023
Why, Phil? Why?

890
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:16,944
Because privacy promotes individuality!
Unofficial motto!

891
00:46:17,027 --> 00:46:19,571
Well, kiddo, looks like
we all have something to hide.

892
00:46:24,493 --> 00:46:26,745
That's it!
Come on, Guy. We're leaving.

893
00:46:26,828 --> 00:46:29,456
Wait, hold on a second.
First, you wanted to get rid of me, Grug,

894
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,250
and now you want me
to come with you?

895
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:32,856
You were trying to take
my daughter away!

896
00:46:32,918 --> 00:46:36,129
Promising my baby girl butterflies
and babbling brooks.

897
00:46:36,213 --> 00:46:37,506
Aha!

898
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:39,341
You see? I knew you were listening.

899
00:46:39,424 --> 00:46:41,201
There is no privacy with you people.

900
00:46:41,285 --> 00:46:43,387
Oh, you mean cave people?

901
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:44,555
Not what I said.

902
00:46:44,638 --> 00:46:48,684
Positives, Eep, that's all I'm saying.
Lots of things here are better.

903
00:46:48,767 --> 00:46:53,063
- "Better"?
- Like not starving, no sleep pile.

904
00:46:53,146 --> 00:46:57,401
- What's wrong with the sleep pile?
- Oh, come on, Eep! The sleep pile reeks!

905
00:46:57,484 --> 00:46:58,735
Reeks of love!

906
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:01,022
Well, at least I smell like me.

907
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:04,032
I don't even know
what you smell like.

908
00:47:04,116 --> 00:47:05,701
Flowers and soft rain.

909
00:47:05,784 --> 00:47:07,619
I don't even know
who you are anymore!

910
00:47:07,703 --> 00:47:10,747
With your vanilla
and your stupid neck rock!

911
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:13,542
It's this place. This place is...

912
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:16,044
Home! This place is home!

913
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:17,754
"Home"?

914
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:20,424
This is the place
my parents wanted me to find!

915
00:47:20,507 --> 00:47:22,259
This is Tomorrow.

916
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:27,472
Well, clearly,
I don't belong in this Tomorrow.

917
00:47:29,683 --> 00:47:31,268
I'm leaving.

918
00:47:31,351 --> 00:47:32,561
Are you coming with me?

919
00:47:33,437 --> 00:47:34,438
I, um...

920
00:47:35,397 --> 00:47:36,523
I can't.

921
00:47:40,068 --> 00:47:42,321
Then I guess we have
two different Tomorrows.

922
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:50,871
Eep.

923
00:47:58,244 --> 00:48:00,881
So, who's ready for dessert?

924
00:48:00,964 --> 00:48:02,090
I told you,

925
00:48:02,174 --> 00:48:04,635
we're not hungry!

926
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:06,261
You ate a banana?

927
00:48:06,345 --> 00:48:09,473
Nuh-uh.
We ate all the bananas.

928
00:48:11,798 --> 00:48:13,685
That's impossible.

929
00:48:13,769 --> 00:48:15,687
Not for cave people.

930
00:48:16,355 --> 00:48:17,981
What have you done?

931
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:20,067
They're just bananas, Phil.

932
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,611
"Just bananas"?
"Just bananas," she says!

933
00:48:22,694 --> 00:48:24,321
That was my one rule!

934
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:26,823
Wait, we're not done.

935
00:48:26,907 --> 00:48:29,201
There was more
I was planning on saying to you!

936
00:48:29,952 --> 00:48:33,205
Mrs. Better-mom,
I'll just take my dessert at the window.

937
00:48:33,789 --> 00:48:36,917
You kidding me?
I've lived with her family for how long?

938
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,687
With the... With the dirt
and the smell.

939
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:44,216
Eep? Eep, is that... you?

940
00:48:47,135 --> 00:48:48,512
I don't know.

941
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:52,474
- Did you hit him?
- No.

942
00:48:52,558 --> 00:48:53,725
I thought about it.

943
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:57,104
The bananas were key
to our survival.

944
00:48:57,187 --> 00:49:01,609
The bananas were
keeping us safe.

945
00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:04,319
Safe from what?

946
00:49:08,407 --> 00:49:09,783
It's here...

947
00:49:09,867 --> 00:49:11,451
for the bananas!

948
00:49:11,535 --> 00:49:12,911
What is, Phil?

949
00:49:12,995 --> 00:49:15,914
It has come every night
for 100 moons or more.

950
00:49:18,959 --> 00:49:22,171
<i>I found bananas are the only thing
that keeps it at bay.</i>

951
00:49:27,217 --> 00:49:28,969
What's on the other side
of the wall, Phil?

952
00:49:29,052 --> 00:49:32,723
<i>Night after night,
it was never enough!</i>

953
00:49:37,311 --> 00:49:41,231
It wants its bananas!

954
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:43,650
What's behind the wall, Phil?

955
00:49:44,193 --> 00:49:45,277
What is it, Phil?

956
00:49:47,029 --> 00:49:49,031
- What are the bananas for?
- What is it?

957
00:49:49,114 --> 00:49:51,700
I don't know!

958
00:50:03,086 --> 00:50:04,087
Huh?

959
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:07,799
It's just a little punch monkey.

960
00:50:07,883 --> 00:50:08,894
I'm leaving.

961
00:50:10,677 --> 00:50:12,888
You just kept giving it bananas?

962
00:50:15,474 --> 00:50:17,559
Wait, wait.
Let me understand something.

963
00:50:18,352 --> 00:50:21,396
You had no idea
you were working...

964
00:50:22,898 --> 00:50:24,399
for an itty-bitty monkey?

965
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:29,015
Giving it bananas for years!

966
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:43,794
That's not good.

967
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,590
No, no, no! Get away!

968
00:50:50,342 --> 00:50:51,343
Phil!

969
00:50:54,388 --> 00:50:57,182
Come on, come on, come on!

970
00:51:04,857 --> 00:51:08,861
Oh, Douglas, those flowers
did not agree with me.

971
00:51:08,944 --> 00:51:10,779
What'd I miss?

972
00:51:12,447 --> 00:51:15,409
Hey, Mrs. Better-mom,
wasn't there a wall there before?

973
00:51:19,204 --> 00:51:20,205
Phil?

974
00:51:20,289 --> 00:51:22,332
Dad? Guy?

975
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:23,458
Grug?

976
00:51:25,335 --> 00:51:26,587
It's gone.

977
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:29,131
The wall is gone. Phil's gone.

978
00:51:29,214 --> 00:51:32,259
Oh, my gosh. Something has taken him,
taken all of them.

979
00:51:32,342 --> 00:51:33,635
What are we gonna do?

980
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:37,014
No sign of them.
But I did find this though.

981
00:51:37,097 --> 00:51:39,725
- Is that my basket?
- Good eye.

982
00:51:39,808 --> 00:51:42,060
Sandy can track them with this.

983
00:51:42,144 --> 00:51:43,437
Sandy, seek.

984
00:51:44,646 --> 00:51:45,647
Okay, right.

985
00:51:45,731 --> 00:51:48,692
You guys go, and Dawn and I
will stay here and fix the wall.

986
00:51:48,775 --> 00:51:52,029
Or better yet, Dawn, let's get you
back inside your panic cubby.

987
00:51:52,112 --> 00:51:54,781
In fact, I think we can both fit
if we suck it in.

988
00:51:54,865 --> 00:51:57,117
She's got the scent.

989
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:59,024
Whatever took them
couldn't have gotten far.

990
00:52:00,236 --> 00:52:02,831
Mom, I'm going too.

991
00:52:02,915 --> 00:52:06,418
Dawn, listen to yourself!
We are not like them.

992
00:52:06,502 --> 00:52:08,003
Dad needs us.

993
00:52:08,086 --> 00:52:09,796
Wait. Dawn!

994
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,219
Dawn, you'll need the travel basket.

995
00:52:15,302 --> 00:52:16,595
It has a neck pillow.

996
00:52:17,179 --> 00:52:18,889
Where are you taking us?

997
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:20,015
Stop talking!

998
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:22,559
If you're going to eat us,

999
00:52:22,643 --> 00:52:25,437
you should eat the fat one first.
He ate your bananas.

1000
00:52:25,521 --> 00:52:27,231
Oh, don't you blame me for this.

1001
00:52:27,314 --> 00:52:29,274
- This is all your fault!
- My fault?

1002
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:30,692
Tell him, Guy!

1003
00:52:30,776 --> 00:52:33,570
She says I changed.

1004
00:52:33,654 --> 00:52:36,365
I didn't change!
This is the real me, baby!

1005
00:52:36,448 --> 00:52:38,367
You know? You know what I'm saying?

1006
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:41,495
What you see, that's what you get.
That's what you...

1007
00:52:41,578 --> 00:52:43,372
There you are.
I lost you for a second.

1008
00:52:43,455 --> 00:52:45,332
Anyway, I don't need anybody.
No one at all.

1009
00:52:45,415 --> 00:52:49,378
Ow! Fine! Wasn't much
of a conversation anyway.

1010
00:52:49,461 --> 00:52:52,506
Guess it's just me
with my thoughts.

1011
00:52:52,589 --> 00:52:53,841
Travel log.

1012
00:52:53,924 --> 00:52:56,343
Literally, I'm traveling in a log.

1013
00:52:56,426 --> 00:52:58,470
So, it's been a while.
A little update.

1014
00:52:58,554 --> 00:53:00,180
<i>Remember that Tomorrow?</i>

1015
00:53:00,264 --> 00:53:02,975
<i>You know, the one
I spent my whole life looking for?</i>

1016
00:53:03,058 --> 00:53:06,812
<i>Well, turns out, the girl I love
wants nothing to do with it...</i>

1017
00:53:06,895 --> 00:53:07,896
<i>or me.</i>

1018
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,649
<i>Girls, very, very complicated.</i>

1019
00:53:10,732 --> 00:53:13,485
<i>Dear diary. Hey, it's me.</i>

1020
00:53:13,569 --> 00:53:15,571
<i>Remember what I said about fate?</i>

1021
00:53:15,654 --> 00:53:18,490
<i>Well, fate's dumb and a liar</i>.

1022
00:53:18,574 --> 00:53:20,784
<i>Fate thinks it's better than you.</i>

1023
00:53:20,868 --> 00:53:22,911
<i>Fate wants to stay with...</i>

1024
00:53:22,995 --> 00:53:26,540
<i>The Bettermans! They're amazing.
I mean, have you seen their tree house?</i>

1025
00:53:26,623 --> 00:53:29,168
<i>What's so great
about living in a tree?</i>

1026
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:31,712
<i>Showers, instant fire,
so much food, and...</i>

1027
00:53:31,795 --> 00:53:33,213
<i>"Privacy."</i>

1028
00:53:33,297 --> 00:53:34,631
<i>Well, one thing's clear.</i>

1029
00:53:34,715 --> 00:53:36,258
- It's over!
- ...over!

1030
00:53:36,341 --> 00:53:37,467
- Fine!
- Fine!

1031
00:53:37,551 --> 00:53:38,902
- Who cares?
- Not me.

1032
00:53:45,601 --> 00:53:48,520
Are you okay?

1033
00:53:48,604 --> 00:53:51,273
- Huh?
- It's so bright out here.

1034
00:53:51,356 --> 00:53:54,436
I just need to watch the window for a...
I just need to watch it for a minute!

1035
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,280
Oh.

1036
00:53:58,363 --> 00:54:00,282
Hey, my travel basket!

1037
00:54:00,365 --> 00:54:03,076
Travel window.

1038
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:07,080
Ugga, can you tell your son to keep
his grubby hands off my stuff, please?

1039
00:54:07,164 --> 00:54:09,875
Listen, I feel really bad
about what happened at dinner

1040
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:12,461
with my parents, and you, and Guy.

1041
00:54:12,544 --> 00:54:14,046
Oh.

1042
00:54:14,129 --> 00:54:16,965
Please, I'm good.
It's in the past!

1043
00:54:18,322 --> 00:54:21,178
You know, Guy and I,
we're too different.

1044
00:54:21,261 --> 00:54:25,849
Well, you and I are different,
and we get along great, right?

1045
00:54:25,933 --> 00:54:27,309
Yeah, yeah.

1046
00:54:27,392 --> 00:54:29,645
But it's-it's complicated.

1047
00:54:29,728 --> 00:54:31,313
He's a boy.

1048
00:54:31,396 --> 00:54:34,483
He is... um... stupid.

1049
00:54:34,566 --> 00:54:35,817
You know, it's different.

1050
00:54:35,901 --> 00:54:38,320
What's the matter?
Boy problems?

1051
00:54:38,403 --> 00:54:41,740
Well, in my day,
we didn't have boy problems.

1052
00:54:41,823 --> 00:54:46,578
Because we didn't have any boys,
or men, or clothes.

1053
00:54:46,662 --> 00:54:50,499
We were a warrior tribe of wimmins.

1054
00:54:50,582 --> 00:54:53,210
The Thunder Sisters!

1055
00:54:54,545 --> 00:54:56,463
What's a Thunder Sister?

1056
00:54:56,547 --> 00:54:59,341
Just Gran's old bedtime stories.

1057
00:54:59,424 --> 00:55:00,676
True stories!

1058
00:55:00,759 --> 00:55:04,137
Okay. Dawn, stop talking
to the crazy lady. Whoa!

1059
00:55:04,763 --> 00:55:07,224
We aren't actually
gonna cross that, are we?

1060
00:55:07,307 --> 00:55:09,184
Yes. Sandy's tracking the scent.

1061
00:55:09,268 --> 00:55:11,645
Well, there's gotta be another way.
You know?

1062
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:16,275
Maybe one that's stable
and not infested with land sharks!

1063
00:55:16,358 --> 00:55:17,359
Tell you what,

1064
00:55:17,442 --> 00:55:21,071
you be in charge of gift baskets,
and I'll be in charge of tracking the men.

1065
00:55:21,154 --> 00:55:22,155
We cross!

1066
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:25,576
Oh, no, no, no.
We are not crossing this!

1067
00:55:25,659 --> 00:55:27,828
My cat, my rules. We cross!

1068
00:55:28,412 --> 00:55:30,497
- Maybe we should take a vote?
- Around!

1069
00:55:30,581 --> 00:55:32,749
- Whoa!
- Cross!

1070
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:34,209
Around!

1071
00:55:34,793 --> 00:55:36,712
- Cross!
- No!

1072
00:55:40,665 --> 00:55:41,833
Sandy, come!

1073
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:47,347
Thank you, Hope.
This is so much safer.

1074
00:55:50,142 --> 00:55:51,602
I can't see!

1075
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:52,978
What's happening?

1076
00:55:53,061 --> 00:55:54,730
Where are they taking us?

1077
00:55:54,813 --> 00:55:57,357
Hold tight, Guy.
As soon as we get out of this log,

1078
00:55:57,441 --> 00:56:00,360
I'll start swinging and punching
our way to freedom.

1079
00:56:05,908 --> 00:56:09,536
Come on, punch monkeys!
Let's get this on!

1080
00:56:17,211 --> 00:56:19,571
It's-It's not just punch monkeys.

1081
00:56:19,655 --> 00:56:20,923
It's kick monkeys,

1082
00:56:21,006 --> 00:56:23,550
headbutt monkeys,
low-blow monkeys,

1083
00:56:23,634 --> 00:56:25,594
bite monkeys, ab-tight monkeys!

1084
00:56:25,677 --> 00:56:28,138
Shoulders that punch!
Tails that crunch!

1085
00:56:28,222 --> 00:56:31,350
Deranged stranglers! Strange danglers!
Fanged manglers!

1086
00:56:31,433 --> 00:56:33,685
Mouth-breathers!
Brain squeezers!

1087
00:56:33,769 --> 00:56:35,479
And a dude with...

1088
00:56:36,104 --> 00:56:37,147
weird eyes.

1089
00:56:38,649 --> 00:56:39,733
Mmm.

1090
00:56:55,666 --> 00:56:57,084
Hmm.

1091
00:56:57,167 --> 00:57:00,337
They seem to have
some kind of primitive language.

1092
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,673
But you can't speak it,
huh, smarty-pants?

1093
00:57:02,756 --> 00:57:06,051
Well, no. But I'm sure
after a few months in captivity...

1094
00:57:06,134 --> 00:57:09,179
I can talk to them.
I'm fluent in punch monkey.

1095
00:57:09,263 --> 00:57:10,931
- You are?
- Impossible.

1096
00:57:11,014 --> 00:57:13,892
Oh, I really don't want to do this.
It's not a pretty language.

1097
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:18,689
Pardon me, I'd like to ask...

1098
00:57:20,941 --> 00:57:22,484
Hmm.

1099
00:57:23,193 --> 00:57:24,570
Uh-huh.

1100
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:26,446
- Ooh! I see.
- So, what's he saying?

1101
00:57:27,281 --> 00:57:31,326
They're angry because
Phil broke the terms of their contract!

1102
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:34,454
Ludicrous! We had no formal agreement,
you chiselers!

1103
00:57:34,538 --> 00:57:37,249
Oh! Also, they want their bananas.

1104
00:57:37,332 --> 00:57:41,420
Yeah, bananas are delicious.
Why is that our problem?

1105
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:43,505
And one more question.

1106
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:51,288
Many moons ago,
their world was a paradise.

1107
00:57:51,371 --> 00:57:53,348
This is gonna be a long story.

1108
00:57:53,849 --> 00:57:56,226
<i>"It was a time of much joy.</i>

1109
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:58,395
<i>The water flowed freely.</i>

1110
00:57:58,478 --> 00:58:00,731
<i>The bananas grew in bunches.</i>

1111
00:58:00,814 --> 00:58:03,483
<i>We had art, politics...</i>

1112
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:05,611
- <i>...economics...</i>
- Ooh.

1113
00:58:05,694 --> 00:58:07,696
<i>...but most of all, bananas.</i>

1114
00:58:07,779 --> 00:58:09,990
<i>So many bananas.</i>

1115
00:58:10,073 --> 00:58:11,950
<i>Then, at full moon,</i>

1116
00:58:12,034 --> 00:58:14,119
<i>the monster
came for its bananas.</i>

1117
00:58:14,912 --> 00:58:16,705
<i>Yep. Good times."</i>

1118
00:58:16,788 --> 00:58:19,499
- Wait. Um, go back.
- Yeah. Did he say "monster"?

1119
00:58:19,583 --> 00:58:22,169
We are not going back!
As I was saying...

1120
00:58:22,252 --> 00:58:23,612
<i>"Good times.</i>

1121
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:27,925
<i>But then, for some strange reason,
the water went away.</i>

1122
00:58:28,008 --> 00:58:30,953
<i>After that,
the bananas went away too.</i>

1123
00:58:31,136 --> 00:58:33,597
<i>But the monster didn't go away. No.</i>

1124
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,600
<i>It came back for its bananas.</i>

1125
00:58:36,683 --> 00:58:38,185
<i>There were no bananas."</i>

1126
00:58:44,983 --> 00:58:48,445
In summary,
they really need those bananas.

1127
00:58:49,009 --> 00:58:50,864
Monsters, bananas.

1128
00:58:50,948 --> 00:58:55,118
I'll tell you what their problem is.
Their water supply is dried up.

1129
00:58:55,202 --> 00:58:57,120
Tell them this word-for-word, Guy.

1130
00:58:57,204 --> 00:59:01,166
I, Phil Betterman, single-handedly
turned a desert into an oasis

1131
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:04,002
by diverting water
from a high mountain source,

1132
00:59:04,086 --> 00:59:06,547
much like that... one.

1133
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:08,048
Wait, Guy, don't translate that.

1134
00:59:11,176 --> 00:59:12,395
Too late.

1135
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:16,515
It was all him!

1136
00:59:16,598 --> 00:59:19,685
He stole your water, ate your bananas
and ruined your society!

1137
00:59:21,061 --> 00:59:24,106
That's it! I will not be pelted!

1138
00:59:25,315 --> 00:59:27,818
Now, impertinent apes...

1139
00:59:27,901 --> 00:59:30,529
...meet the full force of my intellect.

1140
00:59:30,612 --> 00:59:35,033
Look upon Betterman the toolmaker
and despair!

1141
00:59:35,117 --> 00:59:36,385
Jab, jab.

1142
00:59:37,603 --> 00:59:38,604
Ooh!

1143
00:59:46,587 --> 00:59:47,754
Jab, jab, jab.

1144
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:49,423
Way to go, Phil.

1145
00:59:50,632 --> 00:59:53,468
Way to go, Hope.
We lost the scent.

1146
00:59:57,097 --> 00:59:59,558
No, no, no! Travel window!

1147
01:00:00,142 --> 01:00:02,186
Come on, come on. Whoo!

1148
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:03,770
It still works, everybody!

1149
01:00:03,854 --> 01:00:06,732
We are lost.

1150
01:00:06,815 --> 01:00:10,360
This is why you don't follow cave people.
One more word out of...

1151
01:00:10,444 --> 01:00:13,906
We have forgotten the old ways,

1152
01:00:13,989 --> 01:00:17,826
the ways of the world when it was young,
and I was young,

1153
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:24,917
when I was the queen matriarch
of a warrior tribe of wimmins.

1154
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,543
The Thunder Sisters.

1155
01:00:26,627 --> 01:00:29,880
You got it, girl.
The Thunder Sisters.

1156
01:00:29,963 --> 01:00:33,550
We faced down danger
and kicked death in the crotch!

1157
01:00:33,634 --> 01:00:38,013
We don't need the Thunder Sisters, Mom.
We need a way to find the men!

1158
01:00:38,096 --> 01:00:39,932
Oh, a way?

1159
01:00:40,015 --> 01:00:43,143
The Thunder Sisters always find a way!

1160
01:00:43,227 --> 01:00:45,679
Think you got one more flight
in you, old girl?

1161
01:00:48,398 --> 01:00:49,775
Oh, my goodness.

1162
01:00:52,361 --> 01:00:55,321
Fly, Wigasus, fly!

1163
01:00:55,405 --> 01:00:56,448
Go.

1164
01:00:56,532 --> 01:00:58,325
Go and find them, Wigasus.

1165
01:01:00,077 --> 01:01:01,578
That is it!

1166
01:01:01,662 --> 01:01:03,747
You are all crazy!

1167
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:06,542
And you know what?
That hair's not coming back. It escaped.

1168
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:08,544
Which is what we need to be doing,
Dawn.

1169
01:01:08,627 --> 01:01:11,547
Getting away from these crazy...
cave people!

1170
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:12,631
Mom!

1171
01:01:12,714 --> 01:01:15,050
You came barging
into our lives uninvited,

1172
01:01:15,133 --> 01:01:18,428
without even wiping
your disgusting... feet!

1173
01:01:19,805 --> 01:01:23,308
And peeping Thunk over here,
with his dumb... window.

1174
01:01:23,392 --> 01:01:25,060
This show is for older kids.

1175
01:01:25,143 --> 01:01:27,479
And that flea-infested rat baby!

1176
01:01:27,563 --> 01:01:29,231
- Mmm?
- You dumb baby.

1177
01:01:29,314 --> 01:01:30,816
Okay. I'm gonna kill her.

1178
01:01:30,899 --> 01:01:32,609
Hey, hey, hey. Chill.

1179
01:01:32,693 --> 01:01:34,069
And you!

1180
01:01:34,152 --> 01:01:38,031
Taking my daughter outside the wall,
giving her scars and stupid ideas!

1181
01:01:38,115 --> 01:01:40,284
Mom!
Don't talk to my friend that way.

1182
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:41,994
And I'm glad Guy came to his senses

1183
01:01:42,077 --> 01:01:44,204
and realized he doesn't belong
with a cave girl.

1184
01:01:44,288 --> 01:01:46,540
He belongs with us,
the Bettermans!

1185
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,083
Let's go, Dawn!

1186
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:49,960
Mom, where are you going?

1187
01:01:50,043 --> 01:01:52,212
Got to get away!

1188
01:01:53,297 --> 01:01:54,548
Cave people!

1189
01:02:01,763 --> 01:02:03,015
Oh, no.

1190
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:07,186
What is that?

1191
01:02:16,518 --> 01:02:17,529
Eep!

1192
01:02:20,574 --> 01:02:22,201
Get him, Eep! Get him!

1193
01:02:23,285 --> 01:02:24,870
- Mom!
- There she is!

1194
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:29,099
We're coming for you, ice lady!

1195
01:02:40,935 --> 01:02:42,304
Kill circle!

1196
01:02:42,387 --> 01:02:45,474
Come on, stabby.
Time to get stabbing.

1197
01:02:52,405 --> 01:02:53,524
Guys, wait a minute.

1198
01:02:53,614 --> 01:02:55,317
Everyone lower your weapons.

1199
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,819
Dawn. What is she doing?

1200
01:02:57,903 --> 01:02:59,488
Trust her. Lower your weapons.

1201
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:05,327
Come here, little guy.
You can come out.

1202
01:03:06,828 --> 01:03:08,956
Yeah. It's okay. You got it.

1203
01:03:12,167 --> 01:03:13,710
This isn't a monster.

1204
01:03:13,794 --> 01:03:15,003
It's a mom

1205
01:03:15,087 --> 01:03:19,424
who was just afraid for her baby
and being protective,

1206
01:03:19,508 --> 01:03:22,177
and maybe a bit, uh, rude.

1207
01:03:22,261 --> 01:03:26,181
And maybe she just didn't realize

1208
01:03:26,265 --> 01:03:30,352
that the outsiders weren't a threat
but actually...

1209
01:03:30,435 --> 01:03:31,812
friends.

1210
01:03:31,895 --> 01:03:33,397
And that maybe,

1211
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:37,150
the wolf spiders and outsiders
could live in beautiful harmony together

1212
01:03:37,234 --> 01:03:39,361
in their tree house!

1213
01:03:39,444 --> 01:03:40,779
I mean ice cave.

1214
01:03:41,822 --> 01:03:42,823
Whoa.

1215
01:03:42,906 --> 01:03:46,368
You got all that
just from looking at them?

1216
01:03:46,451 --> 01:03:51,290
Perhaps the window
by which I view the world is flawed.

1217
01:03:52,499 --> 01:03:54,459
I'm gonna go pet them.

1218
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:57,970
Oh, look,
they're hugging me with their teeth!

1219
01:03:58,046 --> 01:03:59,214
Ow!

1220
01:04:10,184 --> 01:04:12,186
- Guy.
- Eep?

1221
01:04:12,269 --> 01:04:14,563
- Guy.
- Eep, you came back!

1222
01:04:14,646 --> 01:04:15,856
No.

1223
01:04:16,565 --> 01:04:18,066
You made your choice.

1224
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:21,820
- No. That's not what I wanted!
- Enjoy your... Tomorrow!

1225
01:04:21,904 --> 01:04:23,697
Eep! Come back!

1226
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:24,781
No!

1227
01:04:36,084 --> 01:04:39,922
Grug, do you mind?
I'm trying to think!

1228
01:04:40,005 --> 01:04:44,510
Well, I'm trying to get out of here
before that monster shows up!

1229
01:04:45,886 --> 01:04:48,263
There's no monster,
you bonehead.

1230
01:04:48,347 --> 01:04:51,058
They just want to... scare us.

1231
01:04:51,141 --> 01:04:52,142
That's it!

1232
01:04:52,226 --> 01:04:55,771
Time to strike fear
into the hearts of these apes.

1233
01:05:03,153 --> 01:05:07,616
Look upon Betterman the fire maker
and despair!

1234
01:05:07,699 --> 01:05:08,700
Flame, flame!

1235
01:05:12,037 --> 01:05:14,665
Great.
Now they have spears and fire.

1236
01:05:14,748 --> 01:05:17,167
Guy, he just gave the monkeys fire!

1237
01:05:30,013 --> 01:05:33,100
You ready? And shake.

1238
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,685
Oh. And shake!

1239
01:05:36,311 --> 01:05:38,856
And shake, and shake, and shake,
and shake, and shake!

1240
01:05:38,939 --> 01:05:41,650
Hey, Gran?
Are you sure this is safe?

1241
01:05:41,733 --> 01:05:44,820
Don't worry. It won't hurt... much.

1242
01:05:44,903 --> 01:05:48,323
- Where's Eep?
- She went off to get more firewood.

1243
01:05:48,407 --> 01:05:50,826
- I'm gonna go find her.
- Ugga, help me.

1244
01:05:50,909 --> 01:05:52,494
Shh.

1245
01:05:52,578 --> 01:05:53,912
Eep?

1246
01:05:54,796 --> 01:05:56,073
Eep?

1247
01:06:11,013 --> 01:06:12,306
Oh, hey!

1248
01:06:12,389 --> 01:06:13,432
I'm just...

1249
01:06:13,932 --> 01:06:15,684
I'm just getting some firewood.

1250
01:06:18,604 --> 01:06:20,606
I think you've got it covered.

1251
01:06:20,689 --> 01:06:24,109
Do you wanna take a break
from beating up the forest?

1252
01:06:31,158 --> 01:06:32,951
Are you ready to talk about it?

1253
01:06:38,916 --> 01:06:43,795
I can't believe
he would choose a tree over me.

1254
01:06:43,879 --> 01:06:46,256
I don't think it's that simple.

1255
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:49,760
Guy knew the Bettermans
when he was little.

1256
01:06:49,843 --> 01:06:52,679
They're the closest thing
he has to a family.

1257
01:06:55,098 --> 01:06:57,601
Every time I've been hurt before...

1258
01:06:58,727 --> 01:07:02,147
I've gotten a mark I can see.

1259
01:07:02,241 --> 01:07:05,557
This hurts so much,

1260
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:07,736
and I can't even see it.

1261
01:07:07,819 --> 01:07:09,530
I can see it.

1262
01:07:11,289 --> 01:07:13,033
Doesn't matter.

1263
01:07:13,116 --> 01:07:14,910
We're just too different.

1264
01:07:15,702 --> 01:07:17,204
I don't even care.

1265
01:07:18,038 --> 01:07:21,583
Eep, if something hurts this much,

1266
01:07:21,667 --> 01:07:23,710
maybe it means you do care.

1267
01:07:24,461 --> 01:07:27,840
Maybe it's something
worth fighting for.

1268
01:07:29,216 --> 01:07:32,344
So, what are you
gonna do about it?

1269
01:07:40,018 --> 01:07:43,522
Mom, you sure you don't wanna join us?
It's really warm in here.

1270
01:07:43,605 --> 01:07:46,066
Uh, I'm not really
a sleep-pile person.

1271
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:50,404
I have a shawl to keep me... warm.
That's okay.

1272
01:07:50,487 --> 01:07:53,907
I'll just use the travel basket
to shield mys...

1273
01:07:53,991 --> 01:07:55,868
Aw, come on!

1274
01:08:05,118 --> 01:08:06,879
It's cozy, isn't it?

1275
01:08:06,962 --> 01:08:09,047
- Mmm.
- Told ya.

1276
01:08:13,886 --> 01:08:16,054
Hey, um, Ugga?

1277
01:08:16,638 --> 01:08:18,223
- Eep?
- Hmm?

1278
01:08:18,307 --> 01:08:19,850
Hi.

1279
01:08:19,933 --> 01:08:22,019
I just wanna say, um...

1280
01:08:23,312 --> 01:08:25,647
that I have been terrible.

1281
01:08:25,731 --> 01:08:32,029
After everything I did and said,
you still saved me.

1282
01:08:32,112 --> 01:08:33,113
Why?

1283
01:08:33,697 --> 01:08:36,533
Well, we always say
the pack stays together.

1284
01:08:37,117 --> 01:08:38,285
Unofficial motto.

1285
01:08:38,368 --> 01:08:39,703
It's okay.

1286
01:08:40,453 --> 01:08:44,700
- No. It is not okay. I was awful.
- It's fine.

1287
01:08:44,782 --> 01:08:47,002
- I tried to steal Guy from you.
- It's okay.

1288
01:08:47,085 --> 01:08:50,255
And I gave you
a passive-aggressive basket.

1289
01:08:50,339 --> 01:08:51,381
Yeah, that was weird.

1290
01:08:51,465 --> 01:08:53,008
Who does that?

1291
01:08:53,091 --> 01:08:58,180
And your daughter, obviously,
is not a rat baby.

1292
01:08:58,263 --> 01:08:59,555
She's beautiful.

1293
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:03,894
She is a beautiful human baby.

1294
01:09:03,977 --> 01:09:05,520
- And...
- Enough!

1295
01:09:15,531 --> 01:09:16,698
Where's Guy?

1296
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,243
I think I'm his new pet.

1297
01:09:20,327 --> 01:09:22,621
Oh, that's rough.

1298
01:09:25,707 --> 01:09:27,125
What's he saying, Guy?

1299
01:09:27,209 --> 01:09:29,877
The aged wise one has decreed,

1300
01:09:29,962 --> 01:09:32,631
because we have no bananas
for the monster,

1301
01:09:32,714 --> 01:09:35,216
you will be...

1302
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:37,719
I think I can translate from here, Guy.

1303
01:09:37,803 --> 01:09:43,140
They're saying the oafish caveman
will grow bananas for them,

1304
01:09:43,225 --> 01:09:46,270
watering the fields
with his bitter tears.

1305
01:09:46,353 --> 01:09:50,314
Oh. And naturally,
they want me to supervise.

1306
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:51,399
Not what they said.

1307
01:09:51,483 --> 01:09:53,193
You can't speak punch monkey.

1308
01:09:53,277 --> 01:09:54,570
Can I not?

1309
01:09:54,653 --> 01:09:59,783
{\an8}Monkeys, I have mastered your zesty
and expressive language.

1310
01:09:59,867 --> 01:10:00,909
{\an8}No, you haven't.

1311
01:10:00,993 --> 01:10:06,039
{\an8}Let me talk a little punch monkey.
Phil Betterman is so smart, he's stupid!

1312
01:10:06,123 --> 01:10:09,209
{\an8}Oh, what do you have to say
to this witty rejoinder?

1313
01:10:11,272 --> 01:10:13,172
{\an8}You know what?
Let me fix this.

1314
01:10:13,255 --> 01:10:15,591
Do you mind?
Can I take this? Thanks.

1315
01:10:15,674 --> 01:10:17,676
- Do not interrupt me!
- You stop interrupting me!

1316
01:10:17,759 --> 01:10:20,262
Will you two stop it?
I'm trying to get us out of this!

1317
01:10:20,345 --> 01:10:22,973
I'm in good with these monkeys.
I have a job!

1318
01:10:23,056 --> 01:10:24,892
And you two,
you're gonna mess it up!

1319
01:10:24,975 --> 01:10:26,268
Like you mess up everything!

1320
01:10:26,351 --> 01:10:30,189
Like you messed up
my beautiful teenage romance.

1321
01:10:33,483 --> 01:10:37,738
Guy, son, please understand.

1322
01:10:37,821 --> 01:10:39,656
It's Grug's fault.

1323
01:10:41,408 --> 01:10:42,784
Huh?

1324
01:10:42,868 --> 01:10:45,245
- Get him, Guy!
- I am not on your side!

1325
01:10:45,329 --> 01:10:47,209
- Yeah, he's with me!
- I'm not on yours either!

1326
01:10:48,957 --> 01:10:50,209
Oh.

1327
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:54,411
I recognize those broad shoulders.

1328
01:10:54,505 --> 01:10:57,049
Oh, Eep, you came for me. Boop.

1329
01:10:57,732 --> 01:10:58,800
Ah!

1330
01:11:06,717 --> 01:11:08,010
Mmm.

1331
01:11:09,394 --> 01:11:11,021
What are you doing?

1332
01:11:12,064 --> 01:11:13,524
Where you going, Phil?

1333
01:11:15,692 --> 01:11:18,153
No man cave here.

1334
01:11:19,327 --> 01:11:21,757
You can hide from your family...

1335
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:26,286
...but you can't hide from me.

1336
01:11:28,163 --> 01:11:31,041
Well, your precious pack...

1337
01:11:31,959 --> 01:11:33,836
is glad you're gone...

1338
01:11:34,962 --> 01:11:36,505
because you smother them.

1339
01:11:37,548 --> 01:11:41,260
Oh! Well, you built a wall
around your family.

1340
01:11:41,343 --> 01:11:43,470
But you also built a wall

1341
01:11:43,554 --> 01:11:46,431
around your heart.

1342
01:11:46,515 --> 01:11:47,683
Oh!

1343
01:11:47,766 --> 01:11:49,476
You know what you are?

1344
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,061
I'll tell you what you are.

1345
01:11:51,144 --> 01:11:52,479
- You're...
- A bad...

1346
01:11:52,563 --> 01:11:53,689
Father!

1347
01:12:00,445 --> 01:12:02,739
Words as weapons?

1348
01:12:02,823 --> 01:12:04,283
You're just a cave girl.

1349
01:12:04,366 --> 01:12:06,368
It's called a shower. Try it.

1350
01:12:06,451 --> 01:12:09,079
I told her to take a shower.
Who does that?

1351
01:12:09,162 --> 01:12:10,497
<i>You did.</i>

1352
01:12:11,136 --> 01:12:12,312
Oh, Eep.

1353
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,169
Congratulations, Phil.

1354
01:12:16,128 --> 01:12:17,671
You hit me where it hurts.

1355
01:12:17,771 --> 01:12:20,299
Likewise.

1356
01:12:20,382 --> 01:12:22,301
Hey, Phil! Hey!

1357
01:12:22,384 --> 01:12:23,677
Hello, Grug!

1358
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,513
Grug, am I hallucinating?

1359
01:12:27,264 --> 01:12:30,292
No. Guy's a giant banana.

1360
01:12:30,375 --> 01:12:32,561
What the monkeys were trying to say

1361
01:12:32,644 --> 01:12:36,523
was that we're gonna be sacrificed
to the monster at full moon tonight.

1362
01:12:44,948 --> 01:12:46,617
She's still waiting out there.

1363
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:49,661
I'm not sure her hair
is coming back.

1364
01:12:58,587 --> 01:13:02,257
Ooh. How long was I out for?

1365
01:13:03,967 --> 01:13:05,677
What are you guys all staring at?

1366
01:13:12,226 --> 01:13:13,227
Mom!

1367
01:13:14,269 --> 01:13:17,523
Your hair! It's massive and wild,
and I love it.

1368
01:13:17,606 --> 01:13:18,607
Thanks.

1369
01:13:19,316 --> 01:13:21,568
Gran, your hair!

1370
01:13:21,652 --> 01:13:23,570
What? It's temporary.

1371
01:13:23,654 --> 01:13:26,490
No! It's flying this way!

1372
01:13:31,861 --> 01:13:34,665
Wigasus has returned!

1373
01:13:34,748 --> 01:13:35,974
Get off me.

1374
01:13:41,046 --> 01:13:42,339
Get to the point.

1375
01:13:42,422 --> 01:13:46,009
Punch monkeys.
I hate punch monkeys.

1376
01:13:46,093 --> 01:13:50,472
Wigasus says the men
have been taken over yonder.

1377
01:13:52,224 --> 01:13:54,226
Great. What's the plan?

1378
01:13:54,309 --> 01:13:57,104
What would the Thunder Sisters do?

1379
01:13:57,987 --> 01:14:00,274
Aw. All right, Thunder Sisters!

1380
01:14:00,357 --> 01:14:04,611
If we're gonna rescue these men,
there's something we're gonna need.

1381
01:14:04,695 --> 01:14:05,821
- A window?
- No.

1382
01:14:05,904 --> 01:14:07,239
- A catchy chant?
- No!

1383
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:08,991
Each other.

1384
01:14:09,074 --> 01:14:10,450
"Each" what? No!

1385
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:13,328
New tribe names.

1386
01:14:13,412 --> 01:14:16,081
Sandy, you shall be called "Seeker."

1387
01:14:16,164 --> 01:14:17,833
Eep, "Fire Heart."

1388
01:14:17,916 --> 01:14:19,585
Ugga, "Blood Horn."

1389
01:14:19,668 --> 01:14:21,086
Thunk, you're...

1390
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:22,254
"Thunk."

1391
01:14:22,337 --> 01:14:24,423
Smart girl whose name I don't remember.

1392
01:14:24,506 --> 01:14:25,591
- I'm Dawn.
- No!

1393
01:14:25,674 --> 01:14:27,634
You are "Sister Sunset."

1394
01:14:27,718 --> 01:14:30,429
And you are "Bog Water."

1395
01:14:30,512 --> 01:14:31,889
My name's "Bog Water"?

1396
01:14:31,972 --> 01:14:34,016
I thought of it before you had cool hair.

1397
01:14:34,933 --> 01:14:38,020
I am Bog Water!

1398
01:14:38,103 --> 01:14:40,981
- Hey, Sister Sunset.
- Yeah, Fire Heart?

1399
01:14:41,064 --> 01:14:43,108
- You see those wolf spiders?
- Yeah.

1400
01:14:43,192 --> 01:14:44,776
- Wanna ride them?
- Yeah!

1401
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:46,987
- Thunder Sisters.
- Thunder Sisters!

1402
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:49,448
- Thunder Sisters!
- Thunder Sister!

1403
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:54,067
Thunder Sisters!

1404
01:15:01,339 --> 01:15:07,339
<i>"It Was a Pleasure Sharing"</i>
<i>...by Synchronized, Enjoy!</i>

1405
01:15:26,026 --> 01:15:27,548
Oh, it went in my mouth.

1406
01:15:45,838 --> 01:15:47,214
Well,

1407
01:15:47,297 --> 01:15:49,049
I guess this is it.

1408
01:15:49,842 --> 01:15:53,178
Phil, I'm sorry I ate your bananas.

1409
01:15:54,263 --> 01:15:58,016
I suppose perhaps
I have made mistakes too.

1410
01:15:59,226 --> 01:16:02,437
- Like weaponizing these monkeys?
- Well, yeah.

1411
01:16:02,521 --> 01:16:03,772
Or stealing their water?

1412
01:16:03,856 --> 01:16:05,023
Mmm.

1413
01:16:05,107 --> 01:16:06,859
And teaching them to tie these knots?

1414
01:16:06,942 --> 01:16:08,777
Well, their knots were atrocious!

1415
01:16:12,447 --> 01:16:16,410
I just wish that I'd been able
to see Eep one more time.

1416
01:16:17,911 --> 01:16:22,111
I spent my whole life searching
for a place my parents wanted me to find,

1417
01:16:22,207 --> 01:16:23,917
and I found it.

1418
01:16:24,001 --> 01:16:27,337
But now,
all I can think about is Eep.

1419
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:29,548
My best friend...

1420
01:16:30,549 --> 01:16:33,385
my first and only love.

1421
01:16:34,761 --> 01:16:37,764
You know, your parents
loved you very much.

1422
01:16:37,848 --> 01:16:40,309
I think all they wanted
for you was to...

1423
01:16:41,143 --> 01:16:42,477
find happiness.

1424
01:16:44,188 --> 01:16:46,273
And if there's one thing I know,

1425
01:16:46,356 --> 01:16:49,860
it's that you and Eep
make each other happy.

1426
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,321
Guy,

1427
01:16:52,404 --> 01:16:57,404
there's no one I'd rather my daughter
spend her Tomorrow with than you.

1428
01:16:58,243 --> 01:17:02,331
Guy, I too give you permission
to start a home with Grug's daughter.

1429
01:17:02,414 --> 01:17:04,833
- That's not how it works.
- But it is appreciated.

1430
01:17:04,917 --> 01:17:07,753
And you two twits are the closest thing
I have to fathers.

1431
01:17:07,836 --> 01:17:08,837
Thanks, son.

1432
01:17:08,921 --> 01:17:11,131
We're not so different after all, Grug.

1433
01:17:11,215 --> 01:17:15,594
We're two profoundly foolish fathers
obsessed with bananas...

1434
01:17:17,221 --> 01:17:20,432
...about to die
an incredibly ironic death.

1435
01:17:27,397 --> 01:17:28,941
Grug! What's going on?

1436
01:17:29,816 --> 01:17:31,777
I don't know! I can't see!

1437
01:17:42,496 --> 01:17:44,581
I can't look. What is it?

1438
01:17:44,665 --> 01:17:46,250
It's... It's...

1439
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:47,417
It's...

1440
01:17:49,461 --> 01:17:51,338
actually kind of cute.

1441
01:17:53,465 --> 01:17:56,635
That's just its forehead? Oh, come on!

1442
01:18:07,729 --> 01:18:08,730
