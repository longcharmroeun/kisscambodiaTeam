But before that dawn

481

the dark forces, the Dark Elves,
reigned absolute and unchallenged.

I know these stories.

485
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:19,019
Their leader Malekith made a weapon
out of that darkness

486
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,688
and it was called the Aether.

487

While the other relics
often appear as stones

488
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:26,491
the Aether is fluid and everchanging.

489
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,247
It changes matter into dark matter.

490
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,959
It seeks out host bodies,
drawing strength from their life-force.

491
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,172
Malekith sought to use
the Aether's power

492
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:41,085
to return the universe
to one of darkness.
