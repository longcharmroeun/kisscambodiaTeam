FURY: I didn't lie.

196
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,725
Agent Romanoff had a different

197
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,684
Which you didn't feel
obliged to share.

I'm not obliged to do anything.

199

Those hostages could
have died, Nick.

200
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,801
I sent the greatest soldier in history
to make sure that didn't happen.

201
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,128
Soldiers trust each other.
That's what makes it an army.

Not a bunch of guys running
around shooting guns.

203
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,329
Last time I trusted
someone, I lost an eye.

204
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,722
Look, I didn't want you doing anything
you weren't comfortable with.

Agent Romanoff is comfortable
with everything.

It's called
compartmentalisation.

Nobody spills the secrets,
because nobody knows them all.

My grandfather operated one

Got good tips.

224
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,325
He'd walk home every night, a roll
of ones stuffed in his lunch bag.

225
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,851
He'd say, "Hi."

226
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,923
People would say, "Hi" back.

227
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,126
Time went on, the
neighbourhood got rougher.

228
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,201
He'd say, "Hi."

229
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,769
They'd say, "Keep on steppin'."

230
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,042
Granddad got to gripping that
lunch bag a little tighter.

231
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,001
Did he ever get mugged?

say, "What's in the bag?"

What would he do?

235
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,201
He'd show them.

236
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,242
Bunch of crumpled ones,
and a loaded .22 Magnum.

237
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,084
Yeah, Granddad loved people.

238
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,327
But he didn't trust
them very much.

239

Yeah, I know.

240
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,361
They're a little bit
bigger than a .22.

He had a few suggestions

249
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,801
once he got an up-close
look at our old turbines.

250

These new long-range
precision guns

hostiles a minute.

252

The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA
before he steps outside his spider hole.

Who's "we"?

257
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,241
After New York, I convinced
the World Security Council

258
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,727
we needed a quantum surge
in threat analysis.

259
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,807
For once, we're way
ahead of the curve.

260
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,484
By holding a gun to everyone on
Earth and calling it protection.

261
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,128

264
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,125
Yeah, we compromised.

265
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,483
Sometimes in ways that
made us not sleep so well.

266
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,247
But we did it so that
people could be free.

267
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,647
This isn't freedom.
This is fear.

and security got me out, but
the rebels took hostages.

station there,

587
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,931
and he comes to me with a plan.

588
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,963
He wants to storm the
building through the sewers.

589
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,925
I said, "No, we'll negotiate."

590
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,487
Turned out, the E.L.N. didn't negotiate,
so they put out a kill order.

591
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,848
They stormed the basement,
and what do they find?

592

They find it empty.

593
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,563
Nick had ignored
my direct order,

594
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,082
and carried out an unauthorised
military operation on foreign soil,

595
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,882
and saved the lives of a
dozen political officers,

596
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,326

600
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,281
I don't know.

602
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,081
I did, because Nick told me.

603
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,040
Did he tell you he was
the one who bugged it?

604
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,006
I want you to see something.

605
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,166
<i>INTERROGATOR: Who
hired you, Batroc?</i>

606
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,442
Is that live?

607
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,208
Yeah, they picked him up last night
in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.

608
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,810
ROGERS: Are you saying
he's a suspect?

609
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,530
Assassination isn't
Batroc's line.

610
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,526
PIERCE: No, no. It's more
complicated than that.

611
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,286
Batroc was hired anonymously
to attack the Lemurian Star.

612
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,962
And he was contacted by email
and paid by wire transfer,

613
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,571
and then the money was run
through 17 fictitious accounts.

614
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,043
The last one going
to a holding company

615
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,407
that was registered
to a Jacob Veech.

616
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,931
Am I supposed to
know who that is?

617
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,122
Not likely. Veech
died six years ago.

618
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,251
His last address was
1435 Elmhurst Drive.

619
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,288
When I first met Nick, his
mother lived at 1437.

620
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,248
Are you saying Fury
hired the pirates? Why?

621
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,444
The prevailing theory

622
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,330
was that the hijacking was a
cover for the acquisition

623
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,887
and sale of classified
intelligence.

624
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,530
The sale went sour and
that led to Nick's death.

625
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,445
If you really knew Nick Fury,
you'd know that's not true.

626
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,762
Why do you think we're talking?

627
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,971
See, I took a seat on the Council
not because I wanted to,

628
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,926
but because Nick asked me to,
because we were both realists.

629
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,724
We knew that, despite all the diplomacy
and the handshaking and the rhetoric,

630
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,927
to build a really better world

631
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,803
sometimes means having to
tear the old one down.

632
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,485
And that makes enemies.

633
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,650
Those people that call you
dirty because you got the guts

634
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,605
to stick your hands in the mud and
try to build something better.

635
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,685
And the idea that those
people could be happy today

636
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,606
makes me really, really angry.

637
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,887
Captain, you were the last
one to see Nick alive.

638
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,962
I don't think
that's an accident.

639
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,124
And I don't think
you do, either.

But the Winter
Soldier was there.

Zola's algorithm was
on the Lemurian Star.

So was Jasper Sitwell.

1005
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,521
So, the real question is, how
do the two most wanted people

1006
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:42,644
in Washington kidnap a S.H.l.E.L.D.

1586
02:03:21,640 --> 02:03:23,404
that you belong in
a penitentiary.

1587
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:25,568
Not mouthing off
on Capitol Hill.

1588
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:29,084
You're not going to
put me in a prison.

1589
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:34,005
You're not going to put any of
us in a prison. You know why?

1590
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:36,851
Do enlighten us.

1591
02:03:37,120 --> 02:03:38,451
Because you need us.

1592
02:03:39,560 --> 02:03:41,847
<i>Yes, the world is a
vulnerable place,</i>

1593
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:44,202
<i>and yes, we help
make it that way.</i>

1594
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:47,525
<i>But we're also the ones best
qualified to defend it.</i>

1595
02:03:49,160 --> 02:03:51,128
So, if you want to
arrest me, arrest me.

1596
02:03:52,160 --> 02:03:53,844
You'll know where to find me.

1597
02:04:29,320 --> 02:04:32,164
So, you've experienced
this sort of thing before.

1598
02:04:32,680 --> 02:04:34,205
You get used to it.

1599
02:04:36,920 --> 02:04:39,082
We've been data
mining HYDRA'S files.

1600
02:04:39,320 --> 02:04:41,448
Looks like a lot of rats
didn't go down with the ship.

1601
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,365
I'm headed to Europe tonight.

1602
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:46,560
Wanted to ask if you'd come.

1603
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:49,370
There's something I
got to do first.

1604
02:04:50,280 --> 02:04:52,806
How about you, Wilson? Could
use a man with your abilities.

1605
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:55,564
I'm more of a
soldier than a spy.

1606
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:58,444
All right, then.

1607
02:05:03,080 --> 02:05:07,290
Anybody asks for me, tell them
they can find me, right here.

1608
02:05:09,080 --> 02:05:10,684
You should be honoured. That's
about as close as he gets

1609
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:12,530
to saying thank you.

1610
02:05:13,680 --> 02:05:14,761
Not going with him?

1611
02:05:15,240 --> 02:05:16,526
No.

1612
02:05:16,720 --> 02:05:18,722
- Not staying here.
- Nah.

1613
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:21,608
I blew all my covers. I got
to go figure out a new one.

1614
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:22,921
That might take a while.

1615
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:25,044
I'm counting on it.

1616
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:28,406
That thing you asked for,

1617
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:31,081
I called in a few
favours from Kiev.

1618
02:05:34,040 --> 02:05:36,771
Will you do me a favour?
Call that nurse.

1619
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:38,406
She's not a nurse.

1620
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:40,443
And you're not a S.H.l.E.L.D.
agent.

1621
02:05:41,360 --> 02:05:43,442
- What was her name again?
- Sharon.

1622
02:05:44,200 --> 02:05:45,201
She's nice.

1623
02:05:57,680 --> 02:05:59,444
Be careful, Steve.

1624
02:06:00,280 --> 02:06:02,009
You might not want to
pull on that thread.

1625
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:15,324
You're going after him.

1626
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:17,006
You don't have to come with me.

1627
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:18,241
I know.

1628
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:21,361
When do we start?

1629
02:08:20,760 --> 02:08:24,401
It's over. Fury has released
everything to the public.

1630
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:26,451
Everything he knows about.

1631
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:28,883
<i>Herr</i> Strucker, if they get
word of our work here,

1632
02:08:29,080 --> 02:08:30,889
if they find out
we serve HYDRA...

1633
02:08:31,080 --> 02:08:32,809
HYDRA, S.H.l.E.L.D.

1634
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:36,644
Two sides of a coin that's
no longer currency.

1635
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:41,970
What we have

1636
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,651
is worth more than any
of them ever knew.

1637
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:52,966
We've only scratched the
surface and already,

1638
02:08:55,760 --> 02:08:59,606
there are other facilities doing
HYDRA'S good work around the world.

1639
02:09:00,760 --> 02:09:04,207
We'll feed them to Captain America
and his colourful friends,

1640
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:06,243
and keep them off our scent.

1641
02:09:06,440 --> 02:09:08,681
What about the volunteers?

1642
02:09:08,920 --> 02:09:10,445
The dead will be buried so deep

1643
02:09:10,680 --> 02:09:12,808
their own ghosts won't
be able to find them.

1644
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:16,120
And the survivors?

1645
02:09:18,240 --> 02:09:19,765
The twins.

1646
02:09:23,320 --> 02:09:26,449
Sooner or later, they
will meet the twins.

1647
02:09:28,640 --> 02:09:30,563
It's not a world
of spies any more.

1648
02:09:30,760 --> 02:09:32,728
Not even a world of heroes.

1649
02:09:33,720 --> 02:09:36,451
This is the age of
miracles, Doctor.

1650
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:40,607
There's nothing more horrifying

1651
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:42,566
than a miracle.

1652
02:09:42,590 --> 02:11:42,590
