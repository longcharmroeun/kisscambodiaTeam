1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,292
Shit!

2
00:00:04,625 --> 00:00:05,792
There were people in there.

3
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:07,958
This is the only
language these people understand.

4
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:13,667
She's giving displaced
people shelter and medicine.

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,583
That kinda thing creates loyalty, man.

6
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:17,375
We've literally tried everything we can.

7
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:19,083
We bet on someone with a better hand.

8
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:21,458
Someone recreated the super-soldier serum.

9
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:25,000
You are assuming HYDRA
has something to do with this,

10
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:27,583
which is why you came to me.

11
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:30,875
Luckily, for you, I know where to begin.

12
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:32,792
Drop it, Zemo.

13
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:33,958
Sharon?

14
00:00:34,042 --> 00:00:37,208
Karli Morgenthau and at least
seven others have taken the serum.

15
00:00:37,292 --> 00:00:39,333
We got a name. Wilfred Nagel.

16
00:00:39,417 --> 00:00:41,917
-How many vials did you make?
-Twenty.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,250
Where's Karli now?

18
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:44,333
A couple of days ago,

19
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:48,083
she called and asked if I
could help someone named Donya Madani.

20
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:49,250
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:52,583
She died in Riga,
a city near the Baltic Sea.

22
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:54,042
I have a place we can go.

23
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,417
I'm gonna go on a walk.

24
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:00,167
I was wondering when you were gonna show up.

25
00:01:58,667 --> 00:01:59,708
It is time.

26
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,542
You sure about this?

27
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,542
I won't let you hurt anyone.

28
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,292
It's not gonna work.

29
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:23,833
You are free.

30
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:30,958
You are free.

31
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:56,083
How could you free him?

32
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,208
We need his help.

33
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:02,292
With time, will, and the resources,

34
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:06,208
the Winter Soldier programming
was removed from you like a rotten fur.

35
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:07,625
And I'm grateful for that.

36
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,250
I'm grateful for
everything you and Shuri have done…

37
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,167
Zemo murdered our King T'Chaka at the U.N.

38
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,125
The man who chose us.

39
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:19,708
Who chose me to protect him.

40
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,375
I understand.

41
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:25,917
Very little, if anything,
of our loss and our shame.

42
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:41,250
Eight hours, White Wolf.

43
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,625
Then we come for him.

44
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:20,167
Well, the Wakandans are here.
They want Zemo.

45
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,667
Bought us some more time.

46
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,167
-Were you followed?
-No.

47
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,167
How can you be so sure?

48
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,958
'Cause I know when I'm being followed.

49
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:30,583
It was sweet of you to defend me at least.

50
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:32,792
Hey, you shut it.
No one's defending you.

51
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:33,875
You killed Nagel.

52
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,458
Do we really have to litigate
what may or may not have happened?

53
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:40,292
There's nothing to litigate.
You straight shot the man.

54
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,708
-Sam.
-What?

55
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,458
-Karli bombed a GRC supply depot.
-What? What's the damage?

56
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:47,250
Eleven injured, three dead.

57
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,542
They have a list of demands

58
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,333
and are promising more
attacks if those demands aren't met.

59
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,000
She's getting worse.

60
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,583
I have the will to complete this mission.

61
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:57,750
Do the two of you?

62
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,292
She's just a kid.

63
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,625
You're seeing something
in her that isn't there.

64
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,417
You're clouded by it.

65
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:05,417
She's a supremacist.

66
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,708
The very concept of a Super
Soldier will always trouble people.

67
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:16,708
It's that warped aspiration that
led to Nazis, to Ultron, to the Avengers.

68
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:19,875
-You're talking about our friends.
-The Avengers, not the Nazis.

69
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:23,667
So, Karli is radicalized, but there
has to be a peaceful way to stop her.

70
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:29,375
The desire to become a superhuman
cannot be separated from supremacist ideals.

71
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,875
Anyone with that serum
is inherently on that path.

72
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:37,000
She will not stop.
She will escalate until you kill her.

73
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,125
Or she kills you.

74
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,458
Maybe you're wrong, Zemo.

75
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:43,458
The serum never corrupted Steve.

76
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:44,625
Touché.

77
00:06:45,292 --> 00:06:47,708
But there has never been
another Steve Rogers, has there?

78
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,167
Well, maybe we should give
him to the Wakandans right now.

79
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,833
-And you'll give up your tour guide?
-Yes.

80
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:01,250
From my understanding, Donya is
like a pillar of the community, right?

81
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,917
So, when I was a kid, my TT passed away.

82
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,792
Your TT?

83
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,042
Yeah, my TT, yeah.

84
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,625
Who is your TT?

85
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,292
Fine. When I was a kid,
my aunt passed away

86
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,958
and the entire neighborhood
got together for a ceremony.

87
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:15,042
It was like a week long.

88
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,542
Maybe they're doing the same thing for Donya.

89
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,917
Worth a shot.

90
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,917
Your TT would be proud of you.

91
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,417
Turkish delight.

92
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,750
Irresistible.

93
00:07:30,292 --> 00:07:32,208
The depot that was bombed

94
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:33,833
was funded and run by the GRC,

95
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:36,167
the Global Repatriation Council.

96
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,583
One of the workers
killed was the father of two

97
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,250
and had only been on the job for one week.

98
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:43,333
After condemning this latest action

99
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:45,625
by theradical group
known as the Flag Smashers,

100
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:49,917
the GRC formally began drafting
legislation known as The Patch Act,

101
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,750
which would seek to restore
traditional border regulations

102
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,125
and fast-track the return to normalcy.

103
00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:59,125
The act of violence
has also brought attention

104
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,833
and followers to the Flag Smasher cause.

105
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:05,125
No one can deny the world-wide
reach of this group is growing,

106
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,583
as is the danger.

107
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,667
Shame what's become of this place.

108
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:20,625
When I was young, we used to come
here for fabulous dinners and parties.

109
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,542
I knew nothing of the
politics of the time, of course,

110
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,500
but I remember it being beautiful.

111
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,167
I'm gonna take a look around upstairs.

112
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,333
See what you can find out here.

113
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,292
And keep an eye on him.

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,333
I'll stay out of your way.

115
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:51,917
Hey, kid.

116
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,625
Excuse me.

117
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,458
You heard of Donya Madani?

118
00:08:58,833 --> 00:08:59,833
Um…

119
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,375
No.

120
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,125
Sorry, no.

121
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,958
Hey! Donya Madani?

122
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:17,292
Hey, wait.

123
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:18,958
Shit!

124
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,333
Donya?

125
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:28,417
No?

126
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,958
And what's your favorite color?

127
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yellow?

128
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,667
Can you spell it?

129
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,542
Excuse me.

130
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,333
Do you know a woman by
the name of Donya Madani?

131
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:39,875
She was a refugee here.

132
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:47,667
We're not refugees, for we
have nothing to seek refuge from.

133
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,167
We're internationally-displaced
persons, for what it's worth,

134
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,583
and we don't trust outsiders.

135
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:55,958
No, I understand.

136
00:09:57,917 --> 00:10:01,875
I'm not from here, but I have a
pretty good track record of helping out.

137
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,958
I know what happens when
people say they're going to help out.

138
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,583
Nothing.

139
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,792
The Global Repatriation Council
promised to send more teachers, supplies.

140
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,000
That was six months ago.

141
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,542
-What's your name? I can make a call.
-I know who you are.

142
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:18,792
But I can't trust you.

143
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,208
I'm sorry. Let's go.

144
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:30,708
♪ <i>Baa, baa, black sheep,
have you any wool?</i> ♪

145
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:35,458
♪ <i>Yes, sir, yes, sir,
three bags full</i> ♪

146
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:39,750
♪ <i>One for my master, one for the dame</i> ♪

147
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,625
♪ <i>One for the little
girl who lives down the lane</i> ♪

148
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,375
Turkish delight.

149
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,583
It was always my son's favorite.

150
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,417
My old friend, Donya, passed away.

151
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,125
Did you know her?

152
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,292
Yes.

153
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:12,292
I would like to pay my last respects.

154
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:14,792
Do you know where her funeral will be?

155
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,375
It's starting to feel like a dead end.

156
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:29,833
The hell is he doing?

157
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:35,583
Do you see these men there?

158
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:40,542
They're very bad. Not to be trusted.

159
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,542
Donya is our little secret, okay?

160
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:48,417
Those look good. I want one.

161
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:52,750
Cute kids.

162
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:02,875
Well, I got nothin'.

163
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,417
No one's talkin' about Donya.

164
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,667
Yeah, it's because Karli is
the only one fighting for them.

165
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,792
And she's not wrong.

166
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,083
What do you mean?

167
00:12:12,917 --> 00:12:14,208
For five years,

168
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:18,792
people have been welcomed into countries
that have kept them out using barbwire.

169
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,708
There were houses and jobs.

170
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:24,167
Folks were happy to have
people around to help them rebuild.

171
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:27,167
It wasn't just one community coming together,

172
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,292
it was the entire world coming together.

173
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,792
And then, boom.

174
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,125
Just like that, it goes right
back to the way it used to be.

175
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,417
To them, at least Karli's doin' somethin'.

176
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,083
You really think her ends justify her means?

177
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:41,958
Then, she's no different than
him or anybody else we've fought.

178
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:43,292
She's different.

179
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,500
She's not motivated by the same things.

180
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,125
That little girl.

181
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:50,833
What'd she tell you?

182
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,458
The funeral is this afternoon.

183
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,750
You know the Dora's
coming for you any minute.

184
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,042
In fact, they're probably
lurking outside right now.

185
00:13:07,292 --> 00:13:08,292
Keep talking.

186
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,750
Leaving you to turn on
me once we get to Karli.

187
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:11,833
Hmm.

188
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,125
I prefer to keep my leverage.

189
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You wanna see what
someone can do with leverage?

190
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,083
Take it easy.
Don't engage him.

191
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:27,875
He's just gonna extort you and
do that stupid head tilt thing.

192
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,792
Let me make a call.

193
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:37,625
You want some cherry blossom tea?

194
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:38,875
No, you go ahead.

195
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,417
Well, as nice as it is
to hear a friendly voice,

196
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,750
I can't help but feel a favor comin' on.

197
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,042
We found the camp.

198
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,833
But no one here is tellin' us shit.

199
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:54,708
Zemo found out the funeral's later today,

200
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,792
but he's holdin' us
hostage with the information.

201
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,542
And that surprises you?

202
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,542
So, you don't wanna go into this blind.

203
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,875
Sharon, listen, I know I owe you already,

204
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,000
but we could use a
trustworthy set of eyes on the camp.

205
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,792
You got any more tricks in your bag?

206
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,125
I may or may not have
access to a satellite or two.

207
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,375
Let me see what I can do.

208
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,458
Thank you.

209
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:17,750
Hey, Sam, you gotta play this out.

210
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:21,375
If Karli disappears, we're not
gonna find that serum until it's too late.

211
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,458
I know.

212
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:25,042
The Power Broker went
apeshit when he heard about Nagel.

213
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:26,208
He wants the serum back.

214
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:28,208
You killed the golden goose.

215
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,708
Madripoor's about to get real nasty.

216
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:31,833
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:34,542
Don't apologize. Just find Karli.

218
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,458
Do you think I'm makin' a
mistake making more of us?

219
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:18,500
My grandfather, Lukasz, he was
a World War II resistance fighter.

220
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,708
He always used to tell me,

221
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:22,167
"If you're doing somethin',
and it makes you scared,

222
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,125
it's probably because
it's the right thing."

223
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,917
And he fought Nazis, so…

224
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,167
Seems like good advice.

225
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,500
You know, when I was a kid,
I was actually a Captain America fan.

226
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,042
I don't know if I should
tease you about that yet or not.

227
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:41,208
He made me believe that there
was decent people in this world.

228
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,667
I didn't think there could be
another Captain America until I met you.

229
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:50,583
You know, back then,
there was just good and bad,

230
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,708
but the world's more complicated now.
People are lost.

231
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:57,042
They need a leader who looks like them,
who understands their pain.

232
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,542
Someone who understands that today's heroes

233
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,792
don't have the luxury of
keeping their hands clean.

234
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:09,375
What we're doing will
outlive the legacy of that shield.

235
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,125
That shield is a monument to a bygone era.

236
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,167
A reminder of all the
people history just left out.

237
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,833
If anything, that shield should be destroyed.

238
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:25,250
This serum is how we make change.

239
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:28,875
But first, we pay our respects to Mama Donya.

240
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,042
Karli Morgenthau is too dangerous
for you guys to be pulling this shit.

241
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,208
Ah! How'd you find us now?

242
00:16:39,292 --> 00:16:42,792
Come on. You think two Avengers can
walk around Latvia without drawing attention?

243
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,792
No more keeping us in the dark.

244
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,875
You could start by telling us
why you broke him out of prison.

245
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:51,667
-He did that himself, technically.
-This better be an unbelievable explana…

246
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,750
Hey, take it easy before it gets weird.

247
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,500
I know where Karli is.

248
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:01,042
-Well, where?
-All we know is, it's a memorial.

249
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,667
So, we're gonna intercept her there.

250
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,375
That means civilians.
High risk of casualties.

251
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,750
All right, good, we'll move
in fast. Take her by surprise.

252
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,333
No, I wanna talk to her alone.

253
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:11,792
I'm not losing her again.

254
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,250
Look, the person closest
to her died, she's vulnerable.

255
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,167
If there's any time to
reason with her, it's now.

256
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,750
What? No. Wait, no! No!
Stop. Hold on. Stop, okay?

257
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,208
I think we're way past reasoning with her,

258
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:25,625
unless you forgot that she blew up
a building with people still in it.

259
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,750
Sam, you walk in there
cold, she could kill you.

260
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,417
If I go in hot and the op
goes wrong, more people will die.

261
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,500
You'll let him do this?

262
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:35,250
Are you gonna let your partner walk
into a room with a Super Soldier alone?

263
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,375
He's dealt with worse.
And he's not my partner.

264
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,042
I used to counsel
soldiers dealing with trauma, okay?

265
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,042
-This is in my wheelhouse.
-I know.

266
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,167
And I know those soldiers,
which is why I know this is a bad idea.

267
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,292
Wait, John.

268
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:50,375
If he can talk her down,
it might be worth a try.

269
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,500
We'll deal with you later.

270
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,167
I'm sure it will all come
to an agreeable conclusion.

271
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,125
My associate is just up ahead.

272
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,417
Hello, my friend.

273
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,667
This is for your family.

274
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,167
Can you show us the way?

275
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,042
What the hell?

276
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:46,167
Karli's in there.

277
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,458
All right.

278
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:52,083
-Hey. You got ten minutes.
-Really?

279
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,667
Then we're doing things my way.

280
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,500
Aggressive.

281
00:18:58,417 --> 00:18:59,500
But I get it.

282
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,833
I don't remember my mother or my father.

283
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,042
Same goes for siblings,
grandparents, cousins.

284
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,500
What I do remember is bein' alone.

285
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,792
Worse than bein' hungry or cold or scared.

286
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,083
I was alone.

287
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,417
Until Mama Donya.

288
00:19:30,042 --> 00:19:32,208
Like a lot of you here,
Mama Donya saved me.

289
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:38,833
She clothed me, fed me, loved me.

290
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:03,167
She taught me that we
have to do for each other

291
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,250
because they won't.

292
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,750
And we know who they are.

293
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:10,500
They imposed struggle and hardship on us,

294
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,000
then labeled us as
criminals for pushing back.

295
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,917
But the struggle is
what brings us all together.

296
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,708
People who have nothin' in common.

297
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,375
For we are, after all,
simply one world and one people.

298
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,708
So live accordingly.

299
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:15,667
I saw you back there.

300
00:21:21,417 --> 00:21:22,542
I came alone.

301
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:24,875
I just wanna talk.

302
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:26,875
Bold of you.

303
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:30,833
I'm sorry for your loss.

304
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,167
Don't condescend to me. I'm not a child.

305
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,667
I'm not.
I know what it's like to lose someone.

306
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,458
-Believe me.
-No, you don't. Not like this.

307
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,167
It doesn't have to be a war, Karli.

308
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,250
They started a war

309
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,083
as soon as they kicked us out of
our new homes and onto the street.

310
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:48,333
People around the world need me.
Millions of them.

311
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:51,500
Right, I can't speak for millions,
but I understand you.

312
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,792
I understand your frustration.

313
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,375
I understand your helplessness.

314
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:06,750
So, you want me to stop
because people are gettin' hurt, right?

315
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,167
But, Sam, what if I'm
making the world a better place?

316
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,542
No, it's not a better
place if you're killin' people.

317
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:13,792
It's just different.

318
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:19,417
You're either brilliant
or just hopelessly optimistic.

319
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,458
-Well, can't I be a little bit of both?
-No.

320
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:35,583
Uh-uh. No, no, no.
This is a bad idea.

321
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:37,958
It hasn't been ten minutes, John.
Just sit tight.

322
00:22:38,042 --> 00:22:40,833
Don't do that. Don't patronize me.

323
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:42,792
He knows what he's doing.

324
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:52,292
I'm goin' in.

325
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:02,458
This is all really easy for you, isn't it?

326
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,458
All that serum runnin' through your veins.

327
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:12,000
Barnes, your partner needs backup in there.

328
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:19,208
Do you really want his blood on your hands?

329
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,625
This guy I know,

330
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:27,375
who knows more about Super
Soldiers than anyone else on the planet,

331
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:28,542
he says…

332
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,083
you're a supremacist.

333
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,458
-Me?
-Yeah.

334
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:35,917
That's ridiculous.

335
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Everything I do is to end supremacy.

336
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,833
These corporations and the beasts
who run them, they're the supremacists.

337
00:23:41,917 --> 00:23:44,083
So, let me ask you.

338
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,583
You have more serum, right?

339
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,750
So?

340
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:53,167
Are you going to increase your army?

341
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:55,875
You're killin' innocent people.

342
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:56,958
They're not innocent.

343
00:23:57,042 --> 00:23:59,917
They're roadblocks in my journey
and I'd kill them again if I had to.

344
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Wow.

345
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,708
No, no. I didn't mean it like that.

346
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:05,083
-You tricked me into sounding like…
-Like what?

347
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:10,708
The people I'm fightin' are
trying to take your home, Sam.

348
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:14,292
Why are you here instead of stopping them?

349
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:20,083
You know, my sister's
waiting for that exact same answer.

350
00:24:23,292 --> 00:24:24,500
I'm not your enemy.

351
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:27,167
I agree with your fight.

352
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,833
I just can't get with
the way you're fightin' it.

353
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,417
And I'm sure she wouldn't either.

354
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,083
Karli Morgenthau, you're under arrest.

355
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,792
-This is what that was?
-No, wait…

356
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:45,292
-Tricking me until help came?
-We had enough time to talk.

357
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:46,542
-Nazi.
-Why don't you…

358
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:13,250
Shit.

359
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:14,333
I lost her.

360
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,917
This place is a maze.

361
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,333
Is this what I think it is?

362
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,917
No, no!

363
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:08,417
What did we miss?

364
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:17,083
Did you find the vials?

365
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,750
They've been destroyed.

366
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:27,208
I waited too long.

367
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,708
You know, when we first came together,

368
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:39,375
what were the chances that we'd
all be assigned to the same quarter?

369
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:41,833
To find people I would've never met,

370
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:44,792
people I would've been
taught to hate somewhere else?

371
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,333
I thought we'd been…
Chosen.

372
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:55,667
But now, I just wish there
were a dozen more of us to fight.

373
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,083
We're still stronger than they are.

374
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:02,292
We started this together
and that's how it'll end.

375
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:07,083
Can't function with them on our heels.
We have to deal with them. Including Sam.

376
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:12,625
It's…

377
00:28:13,917 --> 00:28:14,917
It's the Power Broker.

378
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:20,542
"You play revolutionary
on borrowed time, little girl.

379
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:27,625
"I want the serum back or…
I will find you, and I will end you."

380
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,083
We cannot fight two wars and win.

381
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,292
I'll deal with the Power
Broker when the time comes.

382
00:28:35,542 --> 00:28:38,667
And I know how to deal
with Sam without a direct fight.

383
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,125
Yeah? How do you propose we do that?

384
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:42,500
We separate them.

385
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:45,000
And then we kill Captain America.

386
00:28:56,708 --> 00:28:57,750
Were you ever offered it?

387
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:00,167
What?

388
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,500
-The serum.
-No.

389
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:08,833
If you had been, hypothetically,
that is, would you have taken it?

390
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:11,167
No.

391
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,625
No hesitation. That's impressive.

392
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:20,625
Sam,

393
00:29:22,542 --> 00:29:24,208
you can't hold out hope for Karli.

394
00:29:25,042 --> 00:29:26,417
No matter what you saw in her,

395
00:29:27,542 --> 00:29:28,542
she's gone.

396
00:29:29,417 --> 00:29:32,417
And we cannot allow that she and her acolytes

397
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:36,208
become yet another faction
of gods amongst real people.

398
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:40,542
Super Soldiers cannot be allowed to exist.

399
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:44,000
Isn't that how gods talk?

400
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:49,750
And if that's how you feel,
what about Bucky?

401
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:54,625
Blood isn't always the solution.

402
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:01,458
Something's not right about Walker.

403
00:30:02,292 --> 00:30:03,542
You don't say.

404
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:05,917
Well, I know a crazy when I see one.

405
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:08,042
Because I am crazy.

406
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:09,375
Can't argue with that.

407
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:12,917
-Shouldn't have given him the shield.
-I didn't give it.

408
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,833
Well, Steve definitely didn't.

409
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:21,542
All right. That's it. Let's go.
I'm now ordering you to turn him over.

410
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:22,958
Hey, slow your roll.

411
00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:26,333
Shield or no shield, the only thing
you're runnin' in here is your mouth.

412
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:28,667
Now, I had Karli and you overstepped.

413
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,875
He's actually proven himself useful today.

414
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:33,458
We'll need all hands on
deck for whatever's comin' next.

415
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:36,167
How do you want the rest of
this conversation to go, huh?

416
00:30:38,792 --> 00:30:39,792
Yeah.

417
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:42,208
Should I put down the shield?
Make it fair?

418
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,375
Release him to us now.

419
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:05,292
Hi. John Walker.
Captain America.

420
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:13,833
Well, let's, uh, put down the pointy
sticks and we can talk this through, huh?

421
00:31:13,917 --> 00:31:15,333
Hey, John, take it easy.

422
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,375
You might wanna fight Bucky
before you tangle with the Dora Milaje.

423
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:21,583
They don't have jurisdiction here…

424
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:23,583
The Dora Milaje have jurisdiction

425
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:26,542
wherever the Dora
Milaje find themselves to be.

426
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:28,792
Okay.

427
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:31,625
Look, I think we got off on the wrong foot.

428
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:53,083
We should do something.

429
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,042
Looking strong, John.

430
00:31:57,917 --> 00:31:58,917
Bucky…

431
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:05,333
Ayo.

432
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:08,042
Ayo, let's talk about this.

433
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,167
James.

434
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:07,625
He is gone. Leave it.

435
00:33:16,542 --> 00:33:18,333
Did you know they could do that?

436
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,625
No.

437
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:28,125
You all right, man?

438
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:34,292
They weren't even Super Soldiers.

439
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:40,917
Come on.

440
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,667
I can't believe he pulled an El Chapo.

441
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,292
I can.

442
00:34:09,042 --> 00:34:10,042
Come on.

443
00:34:14,792 --> 00:34:15,792
Look, man,

444
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:18,458
the serum and its source are gone.

445
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:21,750
I know it didn't work out the way
you wanted it to, but it ain't all bad.

446
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:22,958
Hmm.

447
00:34:23,042 --> 00:34:25,500
John Walker?
Uh, would you mind?

448
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:27,500
Uh, yeah. Hi. Thank you.

449
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:34,250
Have a good day.

450
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:39,125
How long till that gets really annoying?

451
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:41,625
You're mad she didn't ask for yours.

452
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:42,750
Oh, it's her loss.

453
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:45,333
I even got a little
Battlestar logo I draw with it.

454
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:52,958
If you had the chance to
take the serum, would you?

455
00:34:53,542 --> 00:34:54,667
Hells, yeah.

456
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,958
You wouldn't be worried about how it might…

457
00:34:58,458 --> 00:34:59,667
How it might change you?

458
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:03,417
I mean…

459
00:35:06,042 --> 00:35:10,792
Power just makes a person
more of themselves, right?

460
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:13,875
Karli Morgenthau.

461
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,542
Steve Rogers.

462
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:19,208
And me?

463
00:35:19,792 --> 00:35:22,125
You already have three Medals of Honor.

464
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:26,333
You consistently make the right
decisions in the heat of battle.

465
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,000
Yep.

466
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:35,167
Three badges of excellence to make sure
I never forget the worst day of my life.

467
00:35:37,042 --> 00:35:39,333
We both know that the things

468
00:35:39,417 --> 00:35:42,417
that we had to do in
Afghanistan to be awarded those medals

469
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,167
felt a long way from being right.

470
00:35:44,917 --> 00:35:46,375
Being Cap is the first time

471
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:49,833
I've had the chance to do
something that actually feels right.

472
00:35:51,542 --> 00:35:55,333
But God! Imagine how many lives we could
have saved that day if we had that serum.

473
00:35:58,542 --> 00:35:59,542
I know.

474
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:04,000
I know.

475
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:11,625
Hello?

476
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:12,833
Hello, is this Sarah?

477
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:15,458
Yeah. Who's this?

478
00:36:16,042 --> 00:36:17,417
My name is Karli Morgenthau.

479
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,792
I've seen you on the news.

480
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:27,125
You're the leader of the Flag
Smashers, those terrorists. Right?

481
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:29,333
Revolutionaries,
depending on whose side you're on.

482
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:31,292
Is there a reason you're callin' me?

483
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:33,833
I'm thinking if I need to kill your brother.

484
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:36,958
I thought I could trust him.

485
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:40,375
I got the impression that he
and I had some things in common,

486
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:43,250
but then it turns out he's
working for your new Captain America.

487
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:44,708
I didn't choose him.

488
00:36:44,792 --> 00:36:46,375
Who would you have chosen instead?

489
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:50,917
My world doesn't matter to America,
so why should I care about its mascot?

490
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:54,542
I like you, Sarah. You remind me of me.

491
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:59,208
Karli, if you believe
one thing, believe this.

492
00:36:59,292 --> 00:37:02,500
My brother is not working for that man.

493
00:37:03,542 --> 00:37:04,625
I hope you're right.

494
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:07,375
I need to meet with Sam. Alone.

495
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,958
I'm sending you the
coordinates to pass along.

496
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:11,042
Why me?

497
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:12,625
He needs to know that I'm serious.

498
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:16,292
And I need to know that he
won't betray my trust again.

499
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:19,042
Otherwise, instead of meeting Sam here,

500
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:23,958
I can always meet with you,
and AJ, and little Cass there,

501
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:28,750
maybe out back, by the dock?

502
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:42,167
She said what?

503
00:37:42,708 --> 00:37:44,458
Right. Hold on, hold on.
I know, I know.

504
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:48,708
Listen, pack an
overnight bag and take the boys.

505
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:50,167
What happened?

506
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:52,708
Karli called Sarah.
She threatened my nephews.

507
00:37:54,917 --> 00:37:58,292
Okay. Go somewhere safe.
Only pay cash. All right?

508
00:37:58,375 --> 00:37:59,375
Tell me when you arrive.

509
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,417
I know. Look, I love you.

510
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:04,625
I'll never let anything
happen to you and the boys.

511
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:06,750
Okay. Bye.

512
00:38:10,042 --> 00:38:12,375
Karli wants to meet.
She left a contact number.

513
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:20,292
She said come alone.

514
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:22,917
I'm coming with you.

515
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,333
Karli!

516
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:42,042
You called my sister?
That's how we're gonna play this?

517
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:44,667
I would never hurt her.
I wanted to understand you better.

518
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:48,667
I see you, um, didn't come alone.

519
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:51,125
You have to end this now.

520
00:38:52,458 --> 00:38:53,542
I don't wanna hurt you.

521
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,917
You're a tool in the
regimes I want to destroy.

522
00:38:58,083 --> 00:38:59,667
You're not hiding behind a shield.

523
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:02,292
If I were to kill you,
it'd be meaningless.

524
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,417
I was gonna ask you to join me.

525
00:39:08,042 --> 00:39:09,917
Or do the world a favor and let me go.

526
00:39:16,292 --> 00:39:17,375
Hello, John Walker.

527
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:22,292
Hey, Sam, new Cap is moving,

528
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:25,000
looks like he's found them,
or maybe they found him.

529
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:26,958
It's Walker.

530
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:34,583
I'll send you the location. Go!

531
00:40:07,167 --> 00:40:09,917
Lemar… Lemar!

532
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:52,833
Tie him up.

533
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:03,292
Oh, shit.

534
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:12,042
-What'd you do?
-They've got Lemar.

535
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:03,667
Stay there.

536
00:43:18,958 --> 00:43:20,458
What's with all the knives?

537
00:44:03,917 --> 00:44:05,000
You're welcome.

538
00:44:31,417 --> 00:44:35,458
Hey. Hey. Hey.

539
00:44:35,542 --> 00:44:38,958
Lemar. Lemar.

540
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:29,333
Where is she?

541
00:45:36,917 --> 00:45:38,042
It wasn't me!

542
00:45:38,917 --> 00:45:40,250
It wasn't me!
