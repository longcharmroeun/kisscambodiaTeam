1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,542
They're stealing medicine. Vaccines.

2
00:00:03,625 --> 00:00:04,917
Hi.

3
00:00:06,917 --> 00:00:07,917
Shit.

4
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:11,583
We've got eight Super Soldiers

5
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:12,875
on a bulk supply run. Why?

6
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:16,625
They say their mission is to get things
back to the way it was during The Blip.

7
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:18,208
Maybe they're just trying to help.

8
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:20,458
That serum doesn't
have a great track record.

9
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:23,125
So you're telling me that
there was a Black Super Soldier

10
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:25,125
decades ago and nobody knew about it?

11
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:29,125
You know what they did to me?
People taking my blood.

12
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:32,625
- Isaiah…
- Get out of my house!

13
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,458
Let's take the shield, Sam.

14
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:36,292
Remember what happened when we stole it?

15
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,583
Maybe.

16
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:39,333
Sharon was branded enemy of the state,

17
00:00:39,417 --> 00:00:41,792
and Steve and I were
on the run for two years.

18
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,042
Steve believed in you.

19
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:46,000
So he gave you that shield, and
you threw it away like it was nothing.

20
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:47,500
- Shut up.
- He was wrong about you.

21
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:50,208
And if he was wrong about you,
then he was wrong about me.

22
00:00:50,292 --> 00:00:51,750
We've been targeting civilians

23
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,542
who've been helping Karli move.

24
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,833
Our satellites have found
their symbol popping up

25
00:00:55,917 --> 00:00:59,083
in various displaced communities
all across Central and Eastern Europe.

26
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:02,292
- Walker doesn't have any leads.
- I know where you're going with this, no.

27
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:05,250
He knows all of HYDRA's secrets.
Don't you remember Siberia?

28
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:06,750
Okay, then.

29
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,125
We're gonna go see Zemo.

30
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:51,708
When half of us came back,
it was time to rejoice and reunite.

31
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:56,500
The Global Repatriation Council
knows that for many it wasn't that easy.

32
00:01:56,583 --> 00:02:01,125
So much has changed.
But we're here to help you find your way.

33
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,958
Helping you back
into your homes and jobs.

34
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:08,125
Helping you navigate changes
to society, laws, and borders.

35
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:11,250
Helping you get back
to the way things were.

36
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:15,208
GRC, the Global Repatriation Council.

37
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:19,625
Reset. Restore. Rebuild.

38
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,333
Let's move.

39
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,917
Don't give him a second
to delete, shred, or breathe.

40
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:46,250
- Sir, my name is John Walker.
- Hey, stop!

41
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,333
You're hiding a criminal named
Karli Morgenthau. Do you know her?

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,792
Lemar, need a translator.

43
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,708
Ask him if he knows
Karli Morgenthau and the Flag Smashers.

44
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:07,333
- He says he doesn't know.
- Bullshit. That's bullshit.

45
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:10,417
We know she came through here.
Now where'd she go?

46
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,333
Do you know who I am?

47
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,708
Yes, I do. And I don't care.

48
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,000
It's a waste of time, man.
We ain't gonna find 'em.

49
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,917
You heard anything back
from anybody at Langley?

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Nah.

51
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,042
Karli must be funneling
something from someone I can't see.

52
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:42,917
Listen, she's giving displaced
people shelter and medicine.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,083
- I know.
- That kinda thing creates loyalty, man.

54
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:48,333
I know you want this. I get it.

55
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:50,583
But we've literally
tried everything we can here.

56
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:53,125
So has Langley,
and we keep drawin' blanks.

57
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:00,333
So we bet on someone
who's got a better hand.

58
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,250
- He's just through that corridor.
- Give us a sec.

59
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,000
- I'm gonna go in alone.
- Why?

60
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,333
You're an Avenger.
You know how he feels about that.

61
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:18,458
It's not like you two were known
for frolickin' in the sun together.

62
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:20,250
He was obsessed with HYDRA.

63
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:24,375
We have a history together.
Trust me. I got it.

64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,500
Those days are over.

65
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,375
I know.

66
00:05:10,292 --> 00:05:14,292
I just wanted to see how the
new you reacts to the old words.

67
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,833
Something is still in there.

68
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:29,875
At least you were not conscious
for most of your imprisonment.

69
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,458
That time wasn't exactly a picnic.

70
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:37,333
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

71
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:41,750
It was never personal.

72
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:44,958
You were simply a
means to a necessary end.

73
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,375
Someone recreated
the super-soldier serum.

74
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,625
I need to find out who.

75
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:04,125
You are assuming HYDRA has
something to do with this,

76
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:06,750
which is why you came to me,

77
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:09,458
which means you are desperate.

78
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:14,208
Luckily for you,
I know where to begin.

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,417
What are you talking about?
You wanna break Zemo outta jail?

80
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,542
Where are we, Buck?
Have you lost your mind?

81
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,417
We have no leads, no moves, nothing.

82
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,958
What we have is one of the most
dangerous men in the world behind bars.

83
00:06:27,042 --> 00:06:29,208
We also have eight
Super Soldiers that are loose.

84
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:33,417
Zemo's gonna mess with our minds.
Especially yours. No offense.

85
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:37,208
Offense.

86
00:06:37,292 --> 00:06:39,958
Super Soldiers go against
everything he believes in.

87
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:42,125
He is crazy, but he still has a code.

88
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:45,250
I've been on the wrong side
of that code and so have you.

89
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:49,667
He blew up the UN, he killed
King T'Chaka and framed you for it.

90
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,375
Did you forget that?
You think the Wakandans forgot about it?

91
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,292
It's a rhetorical question. They didn't.

92
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,708
I know why this matters to you,
but it's pushing you off the deep end.

93
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,708
We don't know how
they're gettin' the serum.

94
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:02,792
We don't even know how
many of them there are.

95
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,750
Let me just walk you
through a hypothetical. Can I?

96
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,417
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

97
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,542
What's the book you're reading?

98
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,125
Machiavelli.

99
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:25,000
The weakest point in any system

100
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,708
isn't the software,
the hardware, it's the meatware.

101
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:28,875
The human element.

102
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,667
Now, in this lockup,
it's nine to one, prisoners to guards.

103
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,417
And if two prisoners start fighting,

104
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,250
then the protocol says
four guards have to respond.

105
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,250
So why would two prisoners
randomly start fighting at that moment?

106
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:46,292
Who knows? There could be many reasons…

107
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,708
But the point is, these things escalate.

108
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:01,708
Lockdown procedures
would have to be initiated,

109
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:04,250
and with all those bodies
flying around left and right,

110
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,750
wouldn't be hard to
slip down a hallway or two.

111
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,042
And if the fire alarm got tripped

112
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,917
while the prisoners were being separated…

113
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:29,583
…someone could use the
chaos to their advantage.

114
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,333
I don't like how casual
you're bein' about this.

115
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:50,125
This is unnatural. Are you…

116
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,417
And where are we, man?

117
00:08:58,167 --> 00:08:59,667
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

118
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,542
- No, listen.
- What are you doin' here?

119
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,083
I didn't tell 'cause I knew
you wouldn't let this happen.

120
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:05,458
- What did you do?
- We need him.

121
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:07,458
- You're going back to prison!
- If I may…

122
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:08,625
No!

123
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:11,542
Apologies.

124
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:15,625
When Steve refused to sign the
Sokovia Accords, you backed him.

125
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,333
You broke the law, and you
stuck your neck out for me.

126
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,792
I'm asking you to do it again.

127
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,625
- I really think I'm invaluable…
- Shut up.

128
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:30,625
Okay.

129
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:35,208
If we do this, you don't make
a move without our permission.

130
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,333
Fair.

131
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:41,458
Okay, Zemo,

132
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,250
where do we start?

133
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,917
So our first move is grand theft auto?

134
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:58,917
These are mine. Collected by
family over the generations.

135
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:04,708
I spent years hunting people
HYDRA recruited to recreate the serum.

136
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,833
Because once it's out there,

137
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,083
someone can create an army of people…

138
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:14,375
like the Avengers.

139
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,708
I ended the Winter Soldier
program once before.

140
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:31,792
I have no intention to
leave my work unfinished.

141
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,333
To do this, we'll have to
scale a ladder of lowlifes.

142
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:37,250
Well, join the party.
We've already started.

143
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,417
First stop is a woman named Selby.

144
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,667
Mid-level fence I still have a line on.
From there, we climb.

145
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:51,458
So all this time you've been rich?

146
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:52,625
I'm a Baron, Sam.

147
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,792
My family was royalty until
your friends destroyed my country.

148
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,375
Please.

149
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,750
Apologies if that's a little warm,

150
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,125
the fridge is out.

151
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:28,208
But I will see if there is
some good food in the galley.

152
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,875
It's good to have you back, sir.

153
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,000
You don't know what it's
like to be locked in a cell.

154
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,125
Oh.

155
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,833
That's right. You do.

156
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:47,000
Why don't you tell us
about where we're going?

157
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:48,667
I'm sorry.

158
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,125
I was just fascinated by this.

159
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:55,875
I don't know what to call it,
but this part seems to be important.

160
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,917
Who is Nakajima?

161
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,542
If you touch that again, I'll kill you.

162
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:08,917
I'm sorry.

163
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,500
I understand that list of names.

164
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,542
People you've wronged
as the Winter Soldier.

165
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,500
Don't push it.

166
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,125
I've seen that book.

167
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,292
It was Steve's when
he came out of the ice.

168
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,750
I told him about Trouble Man.
He wrote it in that book.

169
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,542
Did you hear it? What'd you think?

170
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,167
I like '40s music, so…

171
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,667
- You didn't like it?
- I liked it.

172
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,583
It is a masterpiece, James.
Complete. Comprehensive.

173
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,250
It captures the
African-American experience.

174
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,333
He's out of line, but he's right.

175
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,458
It's great.

176
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:44,125
Everybody loves Marvin Gaye.

177
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,208
I like Marvin Gaye.

178
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:46,833
Steve adored Marvin Gaye.

179
00:12:46,917 --> 00:12:49,000
You must have really looked up to Steve.

180
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,417
But I realized something when I met him.

181
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,208
The danger with people like him,

182
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:58,583
America's Super Soldiers,
is that we put them on pedestals.

183
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:00,250
Watch your step, Zemo.

184
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,667
They become symbols. Icons.

185
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:05,417
And then we start to
forget about their flaws.

186
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:10,458
From there, cities fly,
innocent people die.

187
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:12,750
Movements are formed, wars are fought.

188
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,333
You remember that, right?

189
00:13:17,042 --> 00:13:20,208
As a young soldier sent to
Germany to stop a mad icon.

190
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:24,458
Do we want to live in a world
full of people like the Red Skull?

191
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:28,500
That is why we're going to Madripoor.

192
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:32,417
What's up with Madripoor?
You talk about it like it's Skull Island.

193
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,167
It's an island nation in
the Indonesian archipelago.

194
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,208
It was a pirate sanctuary
back in the 1800s.

195
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:39,917
It's kept its lawless ways.

196
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,583
But we cannot exactly
walk in as ourselves.

197
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,833
James, you will have to
become someone you claim is gone.

198
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:06,875
Karli!

199
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:08,958
You better come upstairs.

200
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,000
There's not much time.

201
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,167
You should be with her now.

202
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,875
She'd want that.

203
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,500
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:23,500
We have to fix this.
I'm the only one who looks like a pimp.

205
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,958
Only an American would assume

206
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:27,167
a fashion-forward
Black man looks like a pimp.

207
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,000
You look exactly like the man
you're supposed to be playing.

208
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:36,208
The sophisticated, charming African rake
named Conrad Mack, aka the Smiling Tiger.

209
00:15:36,292 --> 00:15:37,875
He even has a bad nickname.

210
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:41,542
Hell, he does look like me, though.

211
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:45,542
You smell this?

212
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,167
Yeah, what is that? Acid?

213
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,625
Madripoor.

214
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:51,875
No matter what happens,
we have to stay in character.

215
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,167
Our lives depend on it.
There's no margin for error.

216
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,583
High Town's that way.

217
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:58,625
Not a bad place if you wanna visit,

218
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,042
but Low Town's the other way.

219
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,833
Let me guess.
We don't have any friends in High Town.

220
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:53,292
Here we are.

221
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:03,208
Is that the Winter Soldier?

222
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:10,208
Hello, gentlemen.
Wasn't expecting you, Smiling Tiger.

223
00:18:10,792 --> 00:18:14,458
His plans changed.
We have business to do with Selby.

224
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,333
The usual?

225
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,583
Ah.

226
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,625
Smiling Tiger, your favorite.

227
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:54,958
I love these.

228
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,833
Cheers, Conrad.

229
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:03,625
Mmm.

230
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:08,292
Mmm.

231
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:23,583
I got word from on high.
You ain't welcome here.

232
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:27,542
I have no business with the Power Broker,

233
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,500
but if he insists, he can
either come and talk to me…

234
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,250
New haircut?

235
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,083
Or bring Selby for a chat.

236
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,833
A power broker? Really?

237
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,417
Every kingdom needs its king.

238
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:48,083
Let's just pray we stay under his radar.

239
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:50,333
- Do you know him?
- Only by reputation.

240
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:54,792
In Madripoor he is
judge, jury, and executioner.

241
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,458
Didn't take much for him
to fall back into form.

242
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:45,583
Stay in character or
the whole bar turns on us.

243
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,333
Selby will see you now.

244
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,667
Thank you.

245
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:00,292
You good?

246
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:29,667
You should know, Baron.

247
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:33,125
People don't just come
into my bar and make demands.

248
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,667
Not a demand. An offer.

249
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
A lot has changed
since you were here last.

250
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:43,333
By the way, I thought you were
rotting away in a German prison.

251
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:45,708
How did you escape?

252
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,292
People like us always
find a way, don't we?

253
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm sure you've already
figured out what I'm here for.

254
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:58,542
You're taller than
I'd heard, Smiling Tiger.

255
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,625
What's the offer?

256
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,375
Tell us what you know
about the super-soldier serum.

257
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:12,750
And I give you him,

258
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,542
along with the code words
to control him, of course.

259
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,667
He will do anything you want.

260
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,625
Now that's the Zemo I remember.

261
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:27,417
I'm glad I decided not
to kill you immediately.

262
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,667
Yeah, you were right to come to me.

263
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,208
Arrogant, but right.

264
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:39,917
The super-soldier serum
is here in Madripoor.

265
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,875
Dr. Wilfred Nagel is
the man you wanna thank. Or…

266
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,875
condemn, depending on
what side of this you're on.

267
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,958
The Power Broker had him
working on the serum, but…

268
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:53,833
things didn't go as planned.

269
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:56,750
Is Nagel still in Madripoor?

270
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,042
Oh.

271
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:03,542
The bread crumbs you can have for free,
but the bakery is gonna cost you, Baron.

272
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:08,125
And before you get all cute, don't
think you can find Nagel without me.

273
00:23:20,042 --> 00:23:21,125
Answer it.

274
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:23,875
On speaker.

275
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,292
Hello?

276
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:40,333
Hey, um, we need to
talk about this situation.

277
00:23:40,417 --> 00:23:41,625
It's been drivin' me nuts.

278
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:44,167
What situation exactly
are you talkin' about?

279
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,125
Are you high?

280
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:49,250
You know what situation,
it's the only situation me and you have.

281
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,250
What situation, Sarah? Say it.

282
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:54,167
The damn boat.
And watch your tone. Okay?

283
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,750
I let you slide at the bank.

284
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:57,833
The bank. Yeah.

285
00:23:57,917 --> 00:24:01,000
Laundered so much…
Yeah, they'll come around.

286
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:04,000
If that was the case,
then why'd they dog you out, Big Time?

287
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:08,000
Yeah, you damn right I'm Big Time.
You'll see when I have that banker killed.

288
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:12,417
Cass! What'd I tell you about the Cheerios?
I don't have time for this!

289
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,208
Sam, I'm sorry. I'll call you back.

290
00:24:14,292 --> 00:24:15,542
"Sam"?

291
00:24:16,042 --> 00:24:17,042
Who's Sam?

292
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:18,708
Kill them!

293
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:27,792
They're gonna pin this on us.

294
00:24:27,917 --> 00:24:32,833
We have a real problem now,
so leave your weapons and follow my lead.

295
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,333
This is not good.

296
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:48,833
- Shit!
- Come on!

297
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:51,125
I can't run in these heels!

298
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,250
You seem to have a guardian angel.

299
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:11,500
Well, this is too perfect.

300
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,542
Drop it, Zemo.

301
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:18,000
Sharon?

302
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:20,000
You cost me everything.

303
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:21,208
Sharon, wait.

304
00:25:22,417 --> 00:25:25,708
Someone recreated the super-soldier
serum and Zemo had a lead.

305
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:28,542
That explains why you guys are here.
And Selby's dead.

306
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:30,542
So what are you doing here?

307
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:32,333
I stole Steve's shield, remember?

308
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:34,667
I also took the wings for your ass,

309
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,458
so that you could save him from him.

310
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:39,417
I didn't have the Avengers to back me up.

311
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,750
So I'm off the grid in Madripoor.

312
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,625
Don't blow smoke.
I was on the run, too.

313
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,250
Was. Is. Big difference.

314
00:25:45,917 --> 00:25:47,667
I don't speak to my family anymore.

315
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:49,667
I can't.

316
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,625
- My father doesn't know where I am.
- Listen…

317
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:53,500
Sharon, we need your help.

318
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:56,917
Please.

319
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:01,875
This isn't over.

320
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:06,292
I have a place in High Town.
You'll be safe there.

321
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:25,417
Looks like breaking all
those laws is treating you well.

322
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:29,083
I thought if I had to hustle, might as
well enjoy the life of a real hustler.

323
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:31,000
You know how much
I'll get for a real Monet?

324
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:33,458
Deactivate your hustle mode.
You sell fake Monets.

325
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:36,708
No. She means real. This gallery
is specialized in stolen artwork.

326
00:26:36,792 --> 00:26:38,167
Monet. Van Gogh. Classics.

327
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:41,667
It's true. You know, half the artwork
in museums like the Louvre is fake.

328
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,917
Real stuff sits in places like this.

329
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,833
Okay, guys, I see what you're doing.
You're more worldly than good old Sam.

330
00:26:48,417 --> 00:26:50,583
Yeah. What's Google say?

331
00:26:52,292 --> 00:26:53,958
- No shit.
- You guys need to change.

332
00:26:54,042 --> 00:26:55,750
I'm hosting clients in an hour.

333
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,333
Much better.

334
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:04,958
What's going on, Sharon?
You don't ever wanna come back home?

335
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:07,958
They'll lock me up if I
step foot back in the States.

336
00:27:08,042 --> 00:27:10,083
Madripoor doesn't allow extradition.

337
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:11,750
Look, I'm sorry I didn't call,

338
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,417
but after The Blip and the chaos, I just…

339
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,000
Look, you know the whole
hero thing is a joke, right?

340
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,167
The way you gave up that shield,

341
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,333
deep down, you must
know it's all hypocrisy.

342
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,750
He knows. And not so deep down.

343
00:27:25,792 --> 00:27:27,333
By the way, how is the new Cap?

344
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:28,792
Don't get me started.

345
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:32,875
Please. You buy into all
that stars and stripes bullshit.

346
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:37,417
Before you were his pet psychopath,
you were Mr. America! Cap's best friend.

347
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Wow. She's kind of awful now.

348
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:43,792
Karli Morgenthau and at least
seven others have taken the serum.

349
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:48,125
You guys really should steer clear
of all of this for your own safety.

350
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,083
We know it's a risk, but we won't leave

351
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:52,083
until we find the
one who cracked the code.

352
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:54,500
We got a name. Wilfred Nagel.

353
00:27:57,167 --> 00:27:58,875
Nagel works for the Power Broker.

354
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:03,542
We need your help, Sharon.
I can get your name cleared.

355
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:08,125
You haggling with my life?

356
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:09,875
- Not like that.
- I don't buy that.

357
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:13,083
You pretending like
you can clear my name.

358
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:17,125
Okay, maybe it is hypocrisy.
Maybe you're right. What happened to you.

359
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:20,750
But I'm willing to try if you are.

360
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:26,708
They cleared the bionic staring machine,
and he killed almost everybody he's met.

361
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:29,250
- I heard that.
- I don't trust charity.

362
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,042
All right, a deal then.

363
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:34,125
You help us out,
and I get your name cleared.

364
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:45,292
Well, I sell to some
pretty connected people.

365
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:47,583
Lay low, blend in, enjoy the party.

366
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:50,542
Try to stay outta trouble.
I'll see what I can find.

367
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:52,875
Trouble.

368
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:25,375
Hey, guys. I found him.

369
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:27,667
Here we go.

370
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,667
Madripoor could give
New York a run for its money.

371
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,958
They know how to party.

372
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,833
With that bounty on your head,

373
00:29:39,917 --> 00:29:43,000
the longer you're in Madripoor,
the less likely you're ever leaving.

374
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:45,208
All right. He's in there.

375
00:29:45,292 --> 00:29:46,708
Container four-two-six-one.

376
00:29:46,792 --> 00:29:48,667
I'll watch while you guys talk to Nagel.

377
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,542
But hurry. We're on borrowed time.

378
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:05,625
Hey, Sharon.
You sure this is the right one?

379
00:30:05,708 --> 00:30:06,833
It's completely empty.

380
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:08,625
Positive. It has to be.

381
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:48,458
- I'm comin' home, baby
- Come on home

382
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:49,833
Comin' home, baby, now

383
00:30:49,917 --> 00:30:51,458
You know I'm waitin' here for you

384
00:30:51,542 --> 00:30:54,000
I'm comin' home now, real soon

385
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:55,083
You've been gone

386
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:56,375
Comin' home, baby, now

387
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:58,083
You don't know what I'm goin' through

388
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:00,417
I'm comin' home, I know I'm overdue

389
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,083
- Since you went away
- S'pect me any day

390
00:31:03,167 --> 00:31:05,458
- How I feel, too
- Now real soon

391
00:31:06,542 --> 00:31:08,417
- I'm comin' home
- Come on home

392
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,958
Comin' home, baby, now

393
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:11,375
You know I'm prayin' every night

394
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:14,042
Everything is gonna be fine

395
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:15,500
Please come home

396
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:18,583
- I'm comin' home, baby, now
- I want to feel you hold me tight

397
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:20,500
'C'pect to see me now, anytime

398
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:22,083
- When I'm in your arms
- Arms…

399
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,417
Dr. Nagel?

400
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,875
Who are you? What do you want?

401
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:30,125
We know you created
the super-soldier serum.

402
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:31,750
Get out of my lab.

403
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:32,917
Hey!

404
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:36,292
You know who he is, right?

405
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,583
This is Baron Zemo.

406
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:41,542
I know you've heard of him, too, right?

407
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,625
You seem like a pretty smart guy.

408
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:46,958
So you better become
conversational real quick.

409
00:31:47,042 --> 00:31:49,458
How about a counter proposal?

410
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:52,625
Make me a better offer and I'll talk.

411
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:55,750
Guys, we have company.

412
00:32:18,042 --> 00:32:20,417
Every bounty hunter in the city is here.
We gotta go!

413
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:45,208
Okay. Okay.

414
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:55,167
I was brought into HYDRA's Winter Soldier
program to pick up their work

415
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,542
after the five failed
test subjects in Siberia.

416
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:02,000
When HYDRA fell,
I was recruited by the CIA.

417
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:04,833
They had blood samples
from an American test subject

418
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:08,333
with semi-stable traces
of serum in his system.

419
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:16,083
After much labor, I was able to isolate
the necessary compounds in his blood.

420
00:33:16,792 --> 00:33:19,333
I was a god.

421
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:25,458
I did what no other scientist
since Erskine was able to do.

422
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:32,542
But mine was going to be different.
No clunky machines or jacked up bodies.

423
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:36,750
Mine was going to be subtle, optimized,

424
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:39,417
perfect.

425
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:41,750
How have we never heard about this?

426
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:42,917
Because…

427
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:47,417
Before I was able to complete
my work, I turned to dust.

428
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:51,958
Then when I returned,
it was five years later,

429
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:56,083
program had been abandoned,
so I came here.

430
00:33:57,125 --> 00:34:01,708
The Power Broker was more than happy
to fund the recreation of my work.

431
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:03,792
How many vials did you make?

432
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:06,375
Twenty.

433
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:11,125
Karli Morgenthau stole those, so…

434
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:13,708
I can only imagine

435
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:16,417
what the Power Broker has
planned for that poor girl.

436
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,833
- Where's Karli now?
- I don't know where she is.

437
00:34:18,917 --> 00:34:20,208
But a couple of days ago,

438
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:23,958
she called and asked if I could
help someone named Donya Madani.

439
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:26,708
Poor woman has tuberculosis.

440
00:34:26,792 --> 00:34:31,125
Typical of overpopulation in
displacement camps like that.

441
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,792
Well, what happened to her?

442
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:37,083
Not my pig. Not my farm.

443
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,917
Is there any serum in this lab?

444
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:11,708
No.

445
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:16,958
Now what?

446
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:19,750
Guys, we're seriously outta time here.

447
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:22,167
No!

448
00:35:23,292 --> 00:35:24,292
What did you do?

449
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,833
Anybody see Zemo?

450
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:57,167
Let's go.

451
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:14,708
All right! Wait for my signal!

452
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:18,625
Damn it!

453
00:36:33,917 --> 00:36:35,417
And you like living here?

454
00:36:37,042 --> 00:36:38,125
It's not terrible.

455
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:42,500
Ah!

456
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:46,542
- I thought we were going left?
- You went the wrong way!

457
00:36:46,625 --> 00:36:47,625
I was clearing the way!

458
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:49,583
I came out first. You had to follow me.

459
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:51,792
- And where are we now?
- Guys, not the time!

460
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:53,500
- I'm out!
- This is a barricade.

461
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:55,833
It's in every action movie!

462
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:26,875
- Go.
- Come on. Let's go.

463
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,333
Buck!

464
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,542
Let's go!

465
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:51,875
Hello…

466
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:04,208
Supercharged.

467
00:38:04,292 --> 00:38:05,583
You're going back to jail.

468
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:08,375
- Do you want to find Karli or not?
- He's right. We need him.

469
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:10,542
And there's two of us,
and at least 20 of them.

470
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:13,875
- Fine. But if you try that shit again…
- I wouldn't dream of it.

471
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,333
Well, that was one hell of a reunion.

472
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:17,917
Come back to the States with us.

473
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,500
I can't. Just get me
that pardon you promised me.

474
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:22,833
Thanks for everything.

475
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:27,167
You're not gonna move
your seat up, are you?

476
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:29,000
No.

477
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,417
We've got a big problem.

478
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,667
Actually, a couple of them.
I'll tell you in the car. Let's go.

479
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,542
There's another entrance
around the corner.

480
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,083
Have you thought about
taking some time to mourn?

481
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:08,042
- Look, we don't have to do this right now.
- Yes, we do.

482
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:15,375
Did you ever think you'd
end up here, doing this?

483
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:19,833
I was always scrambling for a way out.

484
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:24,208
Even thought about jumping in with
the military, at one point, but, uh…

485
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:27,208
apparently mob security
in Madripoor paid better.

486
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:30,375
I always thought I'd be a teacher.

487
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:31,833
Like Mama Donya.

488
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:36,750
Maybe, like, History or Art or something.

489
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,458
Professor Karli Morgenthau.

490
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,708
- Bit of a tough profession in Madripoor?
- Never thought I'd end up there,

491
00:39:42,792 --> 00:39:46,875
but then when everybody returned,
and we got put out on the street,

492
00:39:47,542 --> 00:39:49,000
I knew it was the only place

493
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:51,375
that had something that
I could use to protect us.

494
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:56,250
Do you remember how scared
we were when we took the serum?

495
00:39:56,333 --> 00:39:58,458
Felt like my veins were on fire.

496
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:01,042
Prayed it'd kill me.

497
00:40:02,542 --> 00:40:05,042
But it was worth it,
because this world is ours.

498
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:08,333
Should have been Mama Donya's.

499
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:12,917
We'll use all of our strength to
give it to the kids in those camps.

500
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:19,208
You know, the Power Broker is gonna
catch up with us eventually, right?

501
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:21,750
That's not a problem.

502
00:40:23,292 --> 00:40:24,958
Nagel was killed in Madripoor.

503
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,375
We've got the last of the serum.

504
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,167
The Power Broker is
about to come begging.

505
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:33,417
So we just have the one
fight ahead of us then?

506
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,542
I'll take those odds.

507
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:38,250
Maybe you get to be a
teacher after all this is over?

508
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:41,292
Maybe.

509
00:40:48,042 --> 00:40:49,208
We've got all we need here.

510
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:53,250
You said that Sam and Bucky were
here on the same day this happened?

511
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:56,917
Correct, do you think they had
anything to do with him getting out?

512
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,458
- Thank you.
- What?

513
00:40:58,542 --> 00:41:02,833
So, you seriously think Sam and Bucky
would've broken Zemo out of prison?

514
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:06,417
That's exactly what I think they did.
They were desperate for leads like us.

515
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,500
Come on, man.

516
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:10,125
You know we can't accuse 'em
of something without evidence.

517
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:13,458
Which is why you and I are just
gonna run with this one for a minute.

518
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:16,708
Okay, so I take it what happens next

519
00:41:16,792 --> 00:41:19,292
isn't a strictly
on-the-books type thing, is it?

520
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:21,208
Lemar, if we get the job done,

521
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:23,250
you think they're
gonna sweat us on the how?

522
00:41:24,792 --> 00:41:27,625
Donya Madani. She's a refugee, yeah.

523
00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:30,458
- Okay, I'm on it.
- Okay. Call me if you get a hit.

524
00:41:30,542 --> 00:41:31,583
Will do.

525
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:32,667
Thanks, Torres.

526
00:41:36,042 --> 00:41:37,042
You okay?

527
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:38,917
Yeah.

528
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:43,083
Just thinking about all the
shit Sharon had to go through.

529
00:41:45,083 --> 00:41:48,292
And Nagel referring to
the American test subject

530
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:51,167
like Isaiah wasn't even a real person.

531
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:54,167
Just makes me wonder

532
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:58,625
how many people have to get steamrolled
to make way for this hunk of metal.

533
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:03,375
Well, it depends on who you ask.
That hunk of metal saved a lot of lives.

534
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:05,333
Yeah, I get that. All right.

535
00:42:07,167 --> 00:42:08,417
Maybe I made a mistake.

536
00:42:09,375 --> 00:42:10,792
- You did.
- Yeah.

537
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:15,250
Maybe I shouldn't have put it in a
museum. I should have destroyed it.

538
00:42:17,792 --> 00:42:19,167
Look, that shield represents

539
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:21,208
a lotta things to a
lotta people, including me.

540
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:24,583
The world is upside down,

541
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,500
and we need a new Cap,
and it ain't gonna be Walker.

542
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:30,250
So before you destroy it,
I'll take it from him myself.

543
00:42:36,042 --> 00:42:37,833
Yeah. Yeah.

544
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:40,667
Okay.

545
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:42,792
Thanks. Good work.

546
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:46,958
They found Madani…

547
00:42:47,542 --> 00:42:48,542
Dead.

548
00:42:49,417 --> 00:42:52,458
She died in Riga,
a city near the Baltic Sea.

549
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,458
I have a place we can go.

550
00:42:57,333 --> 00:43:01,125
I, for one, am looking forward
to coming face to face with Karli.

551
00:43:01,917 --> 00:43:04,750
Oeznik, we're changing the course.

552
00:43:12,667 --> 00:43:14,500
Hey, Diego! Lennox! Second van.

553
00:43:14,583 --> 00:43:16,167
It's the motherlode.

554
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:17,750
Enough for a whole camp.

555
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:19,417
They're just sitting on this stuff.

556
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:24,125
All right. We good?

557
00:43:30,625 --> 00:43:32,292
Filthy Flag Smashers.

558
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:36,750
You had six months' worth of supplies,
just sat there in that building.

559
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:40,042
Don't you understand?
We're fighting for our lives.

560
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:50,042
- Karli, aren't you taking your car?
- No.

561
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:03,458
Put your seat belt on. Now!

562
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:06,208
Shit!

563
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:13,250
There were still people in there.

564
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:16,500
This is the only language
these people understand.

565
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,250
I heard what became of Sokovia.

566
00:44:32,042 --> 00:44:35,375
Cannibalized by its neighbors
before the land was cleared of rubble,

567
00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:38,292
erased from the map.

568
00:44:39,792 --> 00:44:42,792
I don't suppose any of you
bothered visiting the memorial?

569
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:48,167
Of course not.
Why would you? We are here.

570
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:51,417
I'm gonna go on a walk.

571
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
You good?

572
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:55,792
Yeah. I'll see you guys in a bit.

573
00:45:41,417 --> 00:45:42,792
You dropped something.

574
00:45:57,833 --> 00:46:00,167
I was wondering when
you were gonna show up.
