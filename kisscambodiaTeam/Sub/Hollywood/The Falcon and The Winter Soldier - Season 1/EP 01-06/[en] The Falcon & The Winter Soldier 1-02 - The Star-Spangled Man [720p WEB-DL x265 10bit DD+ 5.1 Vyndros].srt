1
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:08,208
World's a crazy place right now.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,958
Alliances are all torn apart.
The world's broken.

3
00:00:13,042 --> 00:00:16,292
Symbols are nothing without the
women and men that give them meaning.

4
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:18,917
Thank you, Captain America.
But this belongs to you.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,042
Tell me about your most recent nightmare.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,667
Look, I know that you
have been through a lot,

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,833
but you've got your mind back,

8
00:00:32,917 --> 00:00:35,750
you are being pardoned. You're free.

9
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,417
To do what?

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,875
Oh, bam! Right there!

11
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,208
You see these guys?
They're guys you gotta worry about.

12
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:42,708
They're called the Flag Smashers.

13
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:46,000
They want a world that's
unified without borders.

14
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:48,458
So, this is the leader
of the Flag Smashers, huh?

15
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:50,125
He's strong.

16
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,583
Oh, my God, Sam.
You better look at this.

17
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:56,125
Join me in welcoming
your new Captain America.

18
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:47,917
Reliving the glory days?

19
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,958
I remember sneaking into this locker room

20
00:01:57,042 --> 00:01:59,625
before each game to see you.

21
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,333
It's probably why we always won.

22
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,167
You nervous?

23
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,750
-Who, me?
-Mmm-hmm.

24
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:07,875
Never.

25
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:13,375
I've been a captain before,
obviously, but this is different.

26
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:14,750
This is…

27
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:23,917
Everybody in the world

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,542
expects me to be something.

29
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,667
And I don't wanna fail them.

30
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,542
-I know.
-Yeah.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Be yourself.

32
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,083
Yeah.

33
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,542
They're gonna love you.

34
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,292
Good luck.

35
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,292
-Love you.
-Love you.

36
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:03,333
-Did he puke yet?
-Not yet. You're up.

37
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,500
-Copy that.
-Good morning.

38
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,292
Good morning, America.
Good morning.

39
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,208
No, you're Captain America, you're not…

40
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:13,208
Good morning.
John, Captain, uh…

41
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:14,458
Captain America.

42
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:16,833
And that's why you failed drama class.

43
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,583
-Can you believe this?
-I know, right?

44
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:24,917
-Yeah.
-Two weeks ago we're prepping the team

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,917
for a special ops
mission in Chile, now this.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,708
Don't get me wrong,
this has been great,

47
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,958
it's been great,
but it's been a lot of handshakes,

48
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:34,708
a lot of suits,
a lot of speeches,

49
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:36,625
and senator meetings,

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,750
and I just wanna do the job.

51
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,625
-This is the job, John.
-Yeah.

52
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,125
All of it is.

53
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:48,542
Star-spangled man with a plan and all that.

54
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,625
It's always been in the job description.

55
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:56,167
Listen, this suit,
it comes with expectations, brother.

56
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,250
Mmm-hmm.

57
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:02,000
You can't just punch your way
out of problems anymore, you know?

58
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,333
Mmm-hmm.

59
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,250
Time to go to work.

60
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:17,083
Time to go to work.

61
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,542
Thank you.

62
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:39,625
Ladies and gentlemen…

63
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,542
Your new Captain America!

64
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,458
Good morning, America.

65
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,667
Yeah!

66
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:06,333
Thank you so much for coming.
This has gotta be fun, though,

67
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:08,833
coming back to your high
school after so much has changed?

68
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:11,292
-John Walker!
-Oh, it's great. We're…

69
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,958
Oh!

70
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:14,417
Yeah.

71
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,917
John, I think the first
thing everyone wants to know

72
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,667
is what is it like being Captain America?

73
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,542
Do eagles fly overhead wherever you go?

74
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,958
Uh, yes.

75
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:29,542
Yeah, that and flags tend to
start majestically waving in the wind.

76
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:30,750
And how's the tour been?

77
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,667
I know they did a big
rollout for you, right?

78
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,125
It's the greatest honor of my life.

79
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,542
Um, but I'm just a little shocked, I think.

80
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,458
How did a guy like me end up here?

81
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:41,208
Oh, wait, wait, wait. "A guy like me"?

82
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:43,458
Somebody's being a bit too humble.

83
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:45,833
For those of you who aren't
familiar with his résumé,

84
00:06:46,792 --> 00:06:50,750
"John Walker, first person in American
history to receive three Medals of Honor,

85
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:54,917
"ran RS-One missions in
counterterrorism and hostage rescue."

86
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,167
The government did a
study of your body at MIT,

87
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,208
and you tested off the charts
in every measurable category.

88
00:07:02,292 --> 00:07:04,417
Speed, endurance, intelligence…

89
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,417
Look, here's the thing, uh,
I'm not Tony Stark,

90
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,167
I'm not Dr. Banner, okay?

91
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,292
I don't have the flashiest gadgets,
I don't have super strength.

92
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,542
But what I do have

93
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:16,625
is guts.

94
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,083
Something Captain America always had,

95
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:21,833
always needs to have,
and I'm gonna need every ounce of it.

96
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:24,333
Because I got big shoes to fill.

97
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:25,958
Did you know Steve Rogers?

98
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:29,042
I was two years out of West Point
when Steve came back on the scene.

99
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:32,000
I followed his career
very closely as an Avenger.

100
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,250
I like to think that I
modeled my work after his.

101
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,333
You've always wanted to be a hero?

102
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:40,708
I liked that what I was doing
\would make people feel safe.

103
00:07:41,292 --> 00:07:43,875
Steve Rogers was the kind
of guy who could do that,

104
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,292
he gave me hope.

105
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,917
Even though I never met him,

106
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,208
he feels like a brother.

107
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:50,375
Wow.

108
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,292
Seems like a good guy.

109
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,708
-You met him?
-No.

110
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:09,417
Thanks for doing this on such short notice.

111
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,042
Yeah. No sweat.
I'm just finishing up the checklist.

112
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,250
You'll be all good to go
once you land in Munich.

113
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,625
-Shouldn't have given up the shield.
-Good to see you too, Buck.

114
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,583
-This is wrong.
-Hey, hey, look, I'm working, all right?

115
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:29,708
So all this outrage is gonna have to wait.

116
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:31,458
You didn't know that was gonna happen?

117
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:33,625
No, of course I didn't
know that was gonna happen.

118
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,458
You think it didn't break my
heart to see them march him out there

119
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:39,250
-and call him the new Captain America?
-Steve didn't want this.

120
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,000
Oh, my God.
What do you want me to do?

121
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,958
Call America and tell 'em
I changed my mind? Huh?

122
00:08:44,042 --> 00:08:48,000
Yeah, right.
It's a great reunion, buddy, be well.

123
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,000
You had no right to give up the shield, Sam.

124
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,750
Hey.
This is what you're not gonna do.

125
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,208
You're not gonna come here
in your overextended life

126
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:56,208
and tell me about my rights.

127
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:58,458
It's over, Bucky.

128
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:01,500
Besides, I have bigger
things to deal with now.

129
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,083
What could be bigger than this?

130
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:07,875
This guy.

131
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:11,500
His connections with rebel organizations
all over Eastern and Central Europe,

132
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,208
and he's strong.
Too strong.

133
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,250
And?

134
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:20,208
Well, he's been connected to this
online group called the Flag Smashers.

135
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:24,500
Now, Redwing traced them to a
building somewhere outside of Munich.

136
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:27,333
-So that's where I'm going.
-Well, I don't trust Redwing.

137
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:30,292
-Hold on a minute.
-You don't have to trust Redwing,

138
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,583
but I'mma go see if he's right.

139
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:35,917
'Cause I have a feeling they
might be a part of the Big Three.

140
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,792
-What "Big Three"?
-The Big Three.

141
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,792
-What Big Three?
-Androids, aliens, and wizards.

142
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,125
-That's not a thing.
-That's definitely a thing.

143
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,458
No, it's not.

144
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,333
Every time we fight,
it's one of the three.

145
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:49,333
-Who are you fighting now, Gandalf?
-How do you know about Gandalf?

146
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:53,125
I read The Hobbit in
1937 when it first came out.

147
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:56,708
-So you see my point?
-No, I don't. There are no wizards.

148
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:58,292
-Doctor Strange.
-Is a sorcerer.

149
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,167
Aah!

150
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,792
A sorcerer is a wizard without a hat.

151
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,250
Think about it. Right?

152
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,708
I'm right.
I just came up with that. It's crazy.

153
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:10,500
But that's not the point.
These guys aren't magical.

154
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,917
They use brute force like you,

155
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,833
the incredibly annoying guy in
front of me with the staring problem.

156
00:10:14,917 --> 00:10:17,042
-I'm coming with you.
-No, you're not.

157
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,792
One minute to drop off, Sam.

158
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,458
So what's our plan?

159
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,208
Great. So no plan.

160
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,000
Thirty seconds!

161
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,250
-Enjoy your ride, Buck.
-No, you can't call me that.

162
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,958
Why not? That's what Steve called you.

163
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:05,000
Steve knew me longer,
and Steve had a plan.

164
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,792
Fifteen seconds to drop.

165
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,250
I have a plan.

166
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,333
Really?

167
00:11:11,792 --> 00:11:12,792
What is it?

168
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:17,792
Great.

169
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,167
Where's the chute?

170
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,625
We're at 200 feet.
It's too low for a chute.

171
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,625
I don't need it anyway.

172
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:29,792
You sure about that?

173
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,458
Yeah.

174
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,792
I have all of that on camera.
You know that, right?

175
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:05,208
Get out of my face, Sam, or I'll break it.

176
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:06,958
Okay, head north. Come on.

177
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,458
Oh-ho-ho. Don't hurt him.

178
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,792
You're doing the staring thing again.

179
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,500
They're in there.

180
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,458
-Where's the guy?
-I don't know.

181
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:57,417
I think they're smuggling weapons, though.

182
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,458
-Well, I think you could be right.
-Hmm.

183
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:01,625
But there's only one way to find out.

184
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:04,167
I see a clear path. I say we take it.

185
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:06,167
We're not assassins.

186
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,083
I'll see you inside or not.

187
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,708
Hey, come on, man.
I'm just messing with you. Come back.

188
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,292
Look at you. All stealthy.

189
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,167
A little time in Wakanda
and you come out White Panther.

190
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,042
-It's actually White Wolf.
-Huh?

191
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:35,750
All right, I'm inside.
Therefore, way ahead of you.

192
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,875
It's not great, but very doable.

193
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:40,708
Huh?

194
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:45,250
-Hello. How are you?
-Good. What did I miss? Nothing.

195
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,792
-All right, let's go.
-No, wait.

196
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,500
I got a vibranium arm.
I can take them.

197
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,917
And I can fly.
Who gives a shit? Wait.

198
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:55,458
-I want to see where they're going.
-There's two people.

199
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,875
-You only see two?
-That's what I saw.

200
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,917
-Let me see what Redwing sees.
-All right.

201
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,708
Let's see what Redwing…

202
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,042
Oh, look at that.
How many people you see now?

203
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:09,625
One, two…
Oh, here it comes again.

204
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,292
-Four. Five.
-Yeah, five. Yeah.

205
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,292
So they're strong. Whatever.

206
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,833
-All right, let's go.
-No, no, wait.

207
00:14:16,917 --> 00:14:18,625
Shit.

208
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,458
All right, let's move.

209
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,458
Let's move. Yeah.

210
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,708
There's an eighth person.
I think they have a hostage.

211
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,667
They're stealing medicine. Vaccines.

212
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:15,583
Hi.

213
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,667
Bucky, talk to me.
What's goin' on?

214
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:23,000
Found the hostage.

215
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,625
You okay?

216
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,000
Shit.

217
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,958
I always wanted to do that.

218
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,208
Good of you to join the fight, Sam!

219
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,375
Sam. John Walker, Captain America.

220
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,167
Lemar Hoskins.

221
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,250
Looks like you guys can use some help.

222
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:39,833
That little girl kicked your ass.

223
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,125
John, where you at, man?

224
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,750
Could have used that shield.

225
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,458
Get off of me.

226
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,250
Those were all Super Soldiers, Sam.

227
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,667
I know.

228
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,542
You're welcome, by the way.

229
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,708
I'm okay. I'm okay.

230
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,625
That was a bad idea.

231
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:58,583
-Sorry about Redwing.
-No, you're not.

232
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,917
What's going on in that
big cyborg brain of yours?

233
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,083
It's computing.

234
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:10,333
You know what? I can actually see it.

235
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:12,042
I can see the gears turning.

236
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:15,417
Oh, they're malfunctioning,
shutting down. Yep, they're on fire.

237
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,625
We gotta figure out
where the serum's coming from.

238
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,042
Yeah. And how in the hell after 80 years

239
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,083
are there eight Super
Soldiers runnin' loose?

240
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,458
So that didn't go as planned, huh?

241
00:19:30,042 --> 00:19:32,000
Okay.

242
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,208
Let's keep going.

243
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,583
Look, at least we know
what we're up against now, huh?

244
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,917
And we're pretty sure
it's one of the Big Three, so…

245
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,625
-Aliens, androids, or wizards?
-Pretty sure.

246
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,333
There's no such thing as wizards.

247
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:50,458
-Then it's aliens, or androids…
-Or Super Soldiers.

248
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:52,875
-Shit. Super Soldiers, for real?
-Yeah.

249
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,625
Wow. All right, well,
then we gotta work together.

250
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:56,792
That's not happening.

251
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,625
I think we stand a much
better chance if we all just…

252
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:03,125
Just 'cause you carry that shield,
it doesn't mean you're Captain America.

253
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,917
Look, I've done the work, okay?

254
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,250
-You ever jump on top of a grenade?
-Yeah. Actually, I have. Four times.

255
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,250
It's a thing I do with my helmet.
It's a reinforced helmet.

256
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,917
It's a long story, but, any…

257
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,958
Look, it's 20 miles to the airport.
You guys need a ride.

258
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:19,917
Guys. Gary, stop. Get in.

259
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:25,875
Okay, so we've got eight
Super Soldiers on a bulk supply run.

260
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:27,708
Why?

261
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:32,792
They say their mission is to get things
back to the way it was during The Blip.

262
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:36,208
-Maybe they're just trying to help.
-They had a funny way of showing it.

263
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,208
That serum doesn't exactly have
a great track record. No offense.

264
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,542
We need to figure out where they're going.

265
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,792
How'd you track 'em here?
The Flag Smashers?

266
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:48,292
Uh, no, we didn't track them,
we tracked you, uh, through Redwing.

267
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,375
You hacked my tech?

268
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,500
Sorry. It's not exactly hacking.

269
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,917
It's government property.

270
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,542
Kind of the government.

271
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:00,792
Does he always just stare like that?

272
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:03,417
You get used to it.

273
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,125
Okay, look, you know,
things have gotten kind of, uh…

274
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,208
Chaotic.

275
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:10,000
Yeah. The GRC, they're
doing the best they can

276
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,167
to get things up and
running smoothly, post Blip.

277
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,625
Reactivating citizenship,
social security, healthcare.

278
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,083
Basically just managing resources

279
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:19,292
for the refugees who
were displaced by the return.

280
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:22,042
The Global Repatriation Council
does all that. I get that.

281
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,792
So why exactly are you two here?

282
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,625
Well, they provide the
resources and we keep things stable.

283
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,792
Yeah, violent revolutionaries
aren't usually good for anyone's cause.

284
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,500
Usually said by the
people with the resources.

285
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,125
We got a lot of resources.

286
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,417
If you guys, if you
joined up with us, we could…

287
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,458
-No.
-I got mad respect for both of y'all.

288
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:40,958
But you were getting your
asses kicked till we showed up.

289
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,708
-Who are you?
-Lemar Hoskins.

290
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:46,542
Look, I see a guy hanging out
of a helicopter in tactical gear,

291
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,292
I need a lot more than Lemar Hoskins.

292
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,333
I'm Battlestar. John's partner.

293
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:51,583
"Battlestar"?

294
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,917
Stop the car!

295
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:59,542
Look, I… I get it, okay?

296
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,333
I get the attitude, I do.

297
00:22:01,417 --> 00:22:04,292
You didn't think that the
shield was gonna end up here.

298
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,542
I get it, Bucky.

299
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:10,333
And I'm…
I'm not trying to be Steve.

300
00:22:10,417 --> 00:22:12,042
I'm not trying to replace Steve.

301
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:17,167
I'm just trying to be the
best Captain America I can be.

302
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:19,167
That's it.

303
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,583
It'd be a whole lot easier if
I had Cap's wingmen on my side.

304
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,833
It's always that last line.

305
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,083
Let's go.

306
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:17,875
You must be famished.

307
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:19,500
-Very hungry.
-Yeah.

308
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:22,292
-Yeah, we are hungry.
-Okay. My wife and I cooked.

309
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:26,083
It's an old family recipe made
with the finest chicken livers.

310
00:23:26,167 --> 00:23:27,750
Please serve yourselves.

311
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:30,750
-Anything you want. Anything. You ask me.
-Um…

312
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:33,542
There is some coffee here and some crackers.

313
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:36,583
-We're okay. Thank you.
-Uh, anything we can do for the cause.

314
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:37,875
Please follow me.

315
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,000
You're becoming a bit of a legend.

316
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:45,167
I hear more and more people talk about
the freedom fighters who are pushing back.

317
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,542
They call you Robin Hood.

318
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,458
Every day more people love you.

319
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:53,792
You'll find refuge wherever you go.

320
00:23:57,458 --> 00:24:00,000
My wife and I made this just for you.

321
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:01,667
Everything is completely clean.

322
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,417
-Okay.
-She made it nice and cozy.

323
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,458
-Thank you. Yeah!
-You're welcome.

324
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:07,792
Oh, my gosh, beds.

325
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:14,458
That's real nice.

326
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:16,458
This has your name written all over it, bro.

327
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:17,750
Hope you feel comfortable.

328
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,292
Thank you.

329
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,417
Thank you.

330
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:26,125
-Too small.
-Shit. They're already looking for us.

331
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:31,417
I'm wiping our aliases off
any public traffic sites now.

332
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,625
Karli. We can't stay here for long.

333
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:37,458
Six months ago would you have imagined
people supporting the cause like this?

334
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,042
We're not playing no more.

335
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,250
We can't let these assholes

336
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:43,292
who were put back in
power after The Blip win.

337
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:46,667
The GRC care more about the people

338
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,958
who came back than the ones who never left.

339
00:24:49,042 --> 00:24:50,917
We got a glimpse of how things could be.

340
00:24:52,917 --> 00:24:55,000
I need to know that you're all committed,

341
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:57,375
because after tomorrow,
there's no going back.

342
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:05,750
Yeah. One world.

343
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:06,833
One people.

344
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:08,583
-One world.
-One people.

345
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:10,625
-One world!
-One people!

346
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:19,500
You all right?

347
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:25,167
Let's take the shield, Sam.

348
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,625
Let's take the shield and do this ourselves.

349
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,083
We can't just run up on the man,
beat him up, and take it.

350
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:37,500
Do you remember what
happened the last time we stole it?

351
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:39,958
-Maybe.
-I'll help you in case you forgot.

352
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,625
Sharon was branded enemy of the state,

353
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,375
and Steve and I were
on the run for two years.

354
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:48,500
I don't know about you,

355
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:51,583
but I don't wanna live the
rest of my life la vida loca.

356
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:57,083
We just got our ass handed to us
by Super Soldiers, and we got nothing.

357
00:25:58,375 --> 00:25:59,792
Not entirely true.

358
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:21,083
There is someone that you should meet.

359
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:40,375
-Hey, it's Black Falcon. What's up?
-It's just Falcon, kid.

360
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:45,083
No, no.
My daddy told me it's Black Falcon.

361
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:48,500
Is it because I'm Black and I'm the Falcon?

362
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:51,333
Well, technically, I mean, yes.

363
00:26:51,417 --> 00:26:53,708
So are you, like, Black kid?

364
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:57,000
I got him, right?

365
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,250
Whatever, man.

366
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:00,875
Whatever.

367
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,167
We're here to see Isaiah.

368
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:24,125
Nobody named Isaiah live here.

369
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:28,500
Look, we just want to talk to him.

370
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:30,500
You must not hear what I just said.

371
00:27:32,042 --> 00:27:33,667
You ain't getting in this house.

372
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:35,583
Y'all can leave now.

373
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:41,125
Tell him the guy from
the bar in Goyang is here.

374
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:43,708
He's gonna know what that means.

375
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:49,167
All right, wait here.

376
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:56,375
Nice kid.
How do you know this guy?

377
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,542
I used to.

378
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:00,417
We had a skirmish during the Korean War.

379
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:07,625
Today's your lucky day.

380
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:10,458
He said he wanna see for himself.

381
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:18,417
Isaiah?

382
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:20,417
Look at you.

383
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:27,792
This is, uh, Sam.
Sam, this is Isaiah.

384
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,208
He was a hero.

385
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,833
One of the ones that HYDRA
feared the most. Like Steve.

386
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:36,000
We met in '51.

387
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:41,917
If by met, you mean I
whupped your ass, then, yeah.

388
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:45,250
We heard whispers he was on the peninsula,

389
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,625
but everyone they sent
after him, never came back.

390
00:28:51,417 --> 00:28:55,208
So the U.S. military dropped me
behind the line to go deal with him.

391
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:59,875
I took half that metal
arm in that fight in Goyang,

392
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:02,708
but I see he's managed to grow it back.

393
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:07,958
I just wanted to see if he got the arm back.

394
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,500
Or if he'd come to kill me.

395
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,667
I'm not a killer anymore.

396
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:22,292
You think you can wake up one
day and decide who you wanna be?

397
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:25,708
It doesn't work like that.

398
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:28,708
Well, maybe it does for folks like you.

399
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:32,417
Isaiah, the reason we're here

400
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:37,000
is because there's more
of you and me out there.

401
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:39,875
-You and me.
-And we need to know how.

402
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:42,000
I'm not gonna talk about it anymore.

403
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:57,333
You know what they did
to me for being a hero?

404
00:29:57,417 --> 00:30:02,458
They put my ass in jail for 30 years.

405
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:05,500
People running tests,

406
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:10,167
taking my blood, coming into my cell.

407
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:13,625
Even your people weren't done with me.

408
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:17,208
-Isaiah…
-Get out of my house!

409
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:19,958
Let's go, man, let's go.

410
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:27,833
-Sam…
-Why didn't you tell me about Isaiah?

411
00:30:27,917 --> 00:30:29,792
How could nobody bring him up?

412
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:34,708
-I asked you a question, Bucky.
-I know.

413
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:37,417
-Steve didn't know about him?
-He didn't. I didn't tell him.

414
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,250
So you're telling me that
there was a black Super Soldier

415
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:42,208
decades ago and nobody knew about it?

416
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:46,167
Hey.

417
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:48,458
What's up, man?

418
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:50,667
-Is there a problem here?
-No, we're just talking.

419
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,750
We're fine.

420
00:30:52,958 --> 00:30:54,250
Can I see your ID?

421
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:56,417
-I don't have ID. Why?
-Man, seriously?

422
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,792
Okay, sir, just calm down.

423
00:30:57,875 --> 00:31:00,208
I am calm.
What do you want? We're just talking.

424
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:01,875
-Give him your ID so we can leave.
-No.

425
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:03,667
-We're just talking.
-Is he bothering you?

426
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,500
No, he's not bothering me.
Do you know who this is?

427
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:08,708
Hey, these guys are Avengers.

428
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:13,083
Oh, God, I am so sorry, Mr. Wilson.

429
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:15,917
I didn't recognize you without the goggles.

430
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,958
I'm really, really sorry about this.

431
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,417
The…

432
00:31:20,542 --> 00:31:23,542
Guys, just wait here, okay? Just…

433
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,875
I didn't… I didn't tell anybody

434
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:34,083
because he had already been through enough.

435
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:39,000
Mr. Barnes,

436
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:42,000
there's a warrant out for your arrest.

437
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:44,583
Look, the president
pardoned him for all that.

438
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:47,292
Not for that. You missed
your court-mandated therapy.

439
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:49,833
It's like missing a check-in with your PO.

440
00:31:49,917 --> 00:31:52,042
I'm sorry, Mr. Barnes, you're under arrest.

441
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:40,417
Sam. I've heard a lot about you.
I'm Dr. Raynor. I'm James's therapist.

442
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,083
So nice to meet you.
Thank you for getting him out.

443
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:44,375
That was not me.

444
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:45,583
Christina.

445
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:49,417
-It's great to see you again.
-You gotta be kidding me. You know him?

446
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,417
Yeah, we did some field ops back in the day.

447
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,250
I heard you were working with Bucky,
so I thought I'd step in.

448
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:56,958
Bucky's not gonna be following
a strict schedule any longer.

449
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:59,208
We haven't finished our work.
Who authorized this?

450
00:32:59,292 --> 00:33:00,333
Um…

451
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:05,917
He's too valuable of
an asset to have tied up.

452
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,792
Just do whatever you got to do
with him, then send him off to me.

453
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:11,167
Got some unfinished business, him and I.

454
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,583
You too, Wilson.
I'll be outside.

455
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:21,083
James, condition of your release,
session now. You too, Sam.

456
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:24,250
-That's okay. I'll be out here with…
-That wasn't a request.

457
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:33,750
So…

458
00:33:34,542 --> 00:33:36,042
Who would like to start?

459
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:38,458
All right, look, Dr. Raynor?

460
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:45,167
I get it, why you want me to
talk to Freaky Magoo over here.

461
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,042
But I'm 100% fine.

462
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,500
It is my job to make sure that you're okay.

463
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:52,375
And so, yeah, this may
be slightly unprofessional,

464
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:54,042
but it's the only way that I can see

465
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:56,333
if you're getting over
whatever's eating at you.

466
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:00,500
-This is ridiculous.
-Yeah. I agree.

467
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:02,667
See? Making progress already.

468
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:06,208
So, who wants to go first?

469
00:34:09,542 --> 00:34:10,833
No volunteers?

470
00:34:10,917 --> 00:34:12,167
Wow. How surprising.

471
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:16,875
Okay. We're going to do an exercise.

472
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:18,708
It's something I use with couples

473
00:34:18,792 --> 00:34:21,042
when they are trying to figure out

474
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,042
what kind of life they wanna build together.

475
00:34:23,917 --> 00:34:26,542
Are you familiar with the miracle question?

476
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:27,958
-Absolutely not.
-Of course not.

477
00:34:28,042 --> 00:34:29,458
Okay, it goes like this.

478
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,500
Suppose that while you're
sleeping, a miracle occurs.

479
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,542
When you wake up,

480
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:38,917
what is something that you would like
to see that would make your life better?

481
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,667
In my miracle, he would…
he would talk less.

482
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,167
Exactly what I was gonna say.
Isn't that ironic?

483
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:49,167
You guys are leaving me with no choice.
It's time for the soul-gazing exercise.

484
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,583
-I like this better.
-Oh, God. He's gonna love this.

485
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:53,792
-Yeah, I'm ready.
-This is right up your alley.

486
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:56,750
-Turn around. Face each other.
-You should really enjoy this.

487
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:57,833
I'm going to.

488
00:34:57,917 --> 00:34:59,125
-I know you are.
-Yeah.

489
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:02,458
-Sam. Face each other.
-Let's do it. Let's stare.

490
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:04,792
-Get close.
-This is a good exercise. Thanks, Doc.

491
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:08,583
All right, good.
All right, get close.

492
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:11,458
Come on, a little closer.

493
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,792
Which way you want to go?

494
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:15,542
-Right or left?
-Why're your legs open?

495
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:18,125
You know what? Fine.
Here. You happy now?

496
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:19,333
-All right.
-All right.

497
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,792
-Good. Fine.
-We're locked in.

498
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:23,417
-That's a little close.
-Very. What you wanted, right?

499
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,583
Guys.

500
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:27,417
Good. Now look at each other.

501
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,417
You need to look at each other in the eyes.

502
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:33,875
There, you see?
That wasn't so hard.

503
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,208
Wait, what are you doing?

504
00:35:42,792 --> 00:35:44,458
Are you having a staring contest?

505
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:49,750
Just blink. Sweet Jesus.

506
00:35:50,792 --> 00:35:55,208
All right, James,
why does Sam aggravate you?

507
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:58,083
And don't say something childish.

508
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:05,083
Why did you give up that shield?

509
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:08,667
Why are you making such a big deal

510
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,292
out of something that
has nothing to do with you?

511
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:13,458
Steve believed in you.

512
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,708
He trusted you.

513
00:36:15,792 --> 00:36:17,667
He gave you that shield for a reason.

514
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,917
That shield, that is…
that is everything he stood for.

515
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
That is his legacy.

516
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:24,875
He gave you that shield, and you
threw it away like it was nothing.

517
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:26,708
-Shut up.
-So maybe he was wrong about you.

518
00:36:26,792 --> 00:36:29,417
And if he was wrong about you,
then he was wrong about me.

519
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:36,833
You finished?

520
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:40,417
-Yeah.
-All right, good.

521
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:45,167
Maybe this is something you
or Steve will never understand.

522
00:36:47,167 --> 00:36:50,083
But can you accept that
I did what I thought was right?

523
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,958
You know what, Doc?
I don't have time for this.

524
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:02,583
We have some real serious shit going on.

525
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:03,875
So how about this?

526
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:07,500
I will squash it right now.

527
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:11,000
We go deal with that,
and when we're done,

528
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:13,667
we both can go on separate,
long vacations

529
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,917
and never see each other again.

530
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,625
-I like that.
-Great.

531
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:20,208
Well, let's get to work.

532
00:37:20,292 --> 00:37:22,333
Thanks, Doc, for making it weird.

533
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:24,042
I feel much better.

534
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:25,542
I'll see you outside.

535
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:29,292
Thank you.

536
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:31,875
That was really great.

537
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:38,708
I know that look. What's wrong?

538
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:43,417
What was rule number two again?

539
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:45,625
Don't hurt anyone.

540
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:50,125
Goodbye, Doc.

541
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:55,875
Well, I feel better.

542
00:37:55,958 --> 00:37:58,458
I feel awful.

543
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:02,917
Gentlemen.

544
00:38:04,208 --> 00:38:05,833
Good to see you again.

545
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:10,750
Look, if we divide ourselves,
we don't stand a chance,

546
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:12,292
you guys know that.

547
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:16,250
So what do you got?

548
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,792
Well, the leader's name's Karli Morgenthau.

549
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:21,167
We've been targeting civilians

550
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:23,417
who've been helping
Karli move from place to place.

551
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,167
They geotagged a location,
then scrambled the signal.

552
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,583
But our satellites have
found their symbol popping up

553
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:31,833
in various displaced communities
all across Central and Eastern Europe.

554
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:35,000
We think she's taking the medicine
she just stole to one of these camps.

555
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:38,167
Well, there are hundreds of those
all over the planet since The Blip.

556
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,125
So I guess you'll have to look real hard.

557
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:41,917
Good thing I have 20/20 vision, huh?

558
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
-Where is she now, Walker? Do you know?
-No, we don't know, Bucky.

559
00:38:46,917 --> 00:38:48,917
It's only a matter of
time before we find out.

560
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,375
Things are really intense for you,
aren't they, Walker?

561
00:38:52,458 --> 00:38:54,250
Take it easy.
Look, Walker's right.

562
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,833
It is imperative that
we find them and stop them.

563
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,208
But you guys have rules of engagement

564
00:38:59,292 --> 00:39:01,750
and all kind of
authorizations you have to get.

565
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:03,125
We're free agents.

566
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,167
We're more flexible.

567
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,708
So it wouldn't make
sense for us to work with you.

568
00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:11,375
A word of advice, then.

569
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,125
Stay the hell out of my way.

570
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:36,042
Damn it! We gotta move out now.

571
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:38,208
-They found us.
-How much time do we have?

572
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:41,417
-None. It's The Power Broker's men.
-Everybody, grab what you can.

573
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:47,875
I can give you time.

574
00:39:49,917 --> 00:39:51,125
I'll hold them off.

575
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,542
Thank you.

576
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:00,750
One world. One people.

577
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:28,125
Let's go!

578
00:40:48,292 --> 00:40:49,417
All right,

579
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,833
stop right there. Freeze!

580
00:40:53,292 --> 00:40:55,125
Hit him, open fire.

581
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:26,000
They got away.

582
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:29,792
So what are you thinking?

583
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:31,542
Well, I know what we have to do.

584
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:34,417
When Isaiah said "my people"…

585
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,833
Oh, don't take that to heart.
That's not what he meant.

586
00:41:36,917 --> 00:41:38,167
No, he meant HYDRA.

587
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,875
HYDRA used to be my people.

588
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:42,583
Not a chance.

589
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:45,958
-Walker doesn't have any leads.
-I know where you're going with this, no.

590
00:41:46,042 --> 00:41:49,333
He knows all of HYDRA's secrets.
Don't you remember Siberia?

591
00:41:49,417 --> 00:41:52,000
So you're just gonna go
sit in a room with this guy?

592
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:54,542
Yes.

593
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:00,500
Okay, then.

594
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:06,708
We're gonna go see Zemo.
