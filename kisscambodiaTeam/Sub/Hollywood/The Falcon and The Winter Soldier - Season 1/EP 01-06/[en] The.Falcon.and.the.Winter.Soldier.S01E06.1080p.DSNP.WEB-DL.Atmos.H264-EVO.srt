1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,458
<i>John F. Walker,</i>

2
00:00:02,542 --> 00:00:06,625
<i>you are hereby stripped of your title
and authority as Captain America,</i>

3
00:00:06,708 --> 00:00:08,167
<i>effective immediately.</i>

4
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:12,000
Everybody, grab what you can.

5
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:14,059
<i>Power Broker will
catch up with us eventually.</i>

6
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:17,042
- I've been making amends.
- No, you were avenging.

7
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:19,875
You want to climb out
of that hell you're in, do the work.

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,458
She died while I was in jail.

9
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:27,833
They will never let a Black man
be Captain America.

10
00:00:27,917 --> 00:00:30,583
<i>You gonna let Isaiah Bradley
get in your head?</i>

11
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:34,000
If I was in his shoes,
I'd probably feel the exact same way.

12
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:37,542
But what would be the point
of all the pain and sacrifice

13
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:40,083
<i>if I wasn't willing to stand up
and keep fightin'?</i>

14
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:41,958
We will ensure the GRC vote never happens.

15
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,458
- I'm only here to kill the Falcon.
- You'll get your chance.

16
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:45,875
Tonight, we go to battle.

17
00:01:38,792 --> 00:01:39,952
<i>The movement is ready.</i>

18
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:42,792
<i>They're not going to stop.</i>

19
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:44,958
<i>Not unless we make them.</i>

20
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:48,167
<i>It's time.</i>

21
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:57,042
<i>We have breaking news.</i>

22
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:59,792
<i>There's a complete lockdown
at the GRC meeting in Lower Manhattan</i>

23
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:02,625
<i>where authorities are saying
they're tracking multiple threats</i>

24
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:06,792
<i>from groups seeking to stop
the GRC's vote on global resettlement.</i>

25
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:09,083
<i>There is a no-fly zone in effect...</i>

26
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:11,333
<i>And the NYPD has the area secured
for the moment.</i>

27
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:13,333
<i>Everyone is urged to stay clear.</i>

28
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:27,417
<i>I'm almost there.</i>

29
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:29,458
What's the plan?

30
00:02:29,542 --> 00:02:31,125
<i>Karli's gotta be close.</i>

31
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,583
<i>- Keep your eyes open.</i>
- Well, it could be anybody.

32
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:34,708
Sergeant Barnes.

33
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,500
<i>And by the way,
I called in some backup.</i>

34
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:43,208
Excuse me, sir.
Are you supposed to be here?

35
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,333
It's me.

36
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:51,792
- Sharon, what the hell are you doing here?
- Relax. No one's looking for me here.

37
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,625
<i>- Is that Sharon?</i>
- Unfortunately.

38
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,833
Hey, Sam.
I thought I'd get the band back together.

39
00:02:55,917 --> 00:02:58,500
<i>Thank you.
You're risking a lot coming here.</i>

40
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:01,042
I hear pardons
aren't all they're cracked up to be.

41
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,417
Depends on the therapist.

42
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,125
<i>They'll move
on the building soon. Be ready.</i>

43
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,167
He's here. Do it now.

44
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,750
Keep your head down.
Move toward the door, sir.

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,208
Sharon, Bucky,
what's going on on your end?

46
00:03:58,292 --> 00:03:59,792
Nothing. All quiet.

47
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,417
I'm sorry, wait. Who are you?

48
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,875
- I'm Captain America.
- I thought he was on the Moon.

49
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,375
No one's moving toward the building.

50
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,375
Karli's not coming in.
She's trying to force everybody out.

51
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,833
- East evac teams...
- It's a misdirect.

52
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:13,167
We gotta keep everybody inside.

53
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:19,583
You cost me a lot of money.

54
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:22,667
I wonder how much I can get
for your new bird costume.

55
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,292
A baguette and a few French fries.

56
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,292
You guys are gonna have to do something.

57
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,333
<i>Don't let 'em out of the building.</i>

58
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:35,542
Oops.

59
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:37,417
Here's one of them.

60
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:39,750
I'll get the evac.

61
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:43,125
Lennox, they're heading down
the east stairwell.

62
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:46,018
<i>This is an emergency evacuation.</i>

63
00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:48,083
<i>Please proceed to your transports.</i>

64
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:51,333
<i>Groups one and two will leave
from secure vehicles in the basement.</i>

65
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:53,708
<i>Group three will leave
via air support on the roof.</i>

66
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,208
Mr. Barnes, it's Karli.

67
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:15,708
<i>Karli?</i>

68
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:18,292
Aren't you tired
of fighting for the wrong side?

69
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,417
I've done this before, kid.

70
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,667
I know how it ends.

71
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,542
It doesn't matter if I don't survive this.

72
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,583
I'm fighting for something
bigger than myself.

73
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:29,708
With all the bodies you've collected,
have you been able to say the same?

74
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:32,833
You don't think I ever fought
for something bigger than myself?

75
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:35,750
That's all I ever tried to do.
And I failed twice.

76
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,375
You think your cause
justifies all this death,

77
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,292
but in the end,
the nightmares won't go away.

78
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,417
<i>You're gonna remember
all the ones you killed.</i>

79
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
Trust me.

80
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:46,542
Don't do this.

81
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,667
Don't go down this path.

82
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,000
If that's how you feel,
you should sit this one out.

83
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,417
Come on, you know I ain't gonna do that.

84
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,250
Well, thank you.

85
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,917
<i>I'm glad you took my call.
You've been a big help.</i>

86
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:04,208
Damn it!

87
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:14,583
Hostages en route.
ETA, six minutes.

88
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:19,042
Seriously, Bucky, you had one job.

89
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,333
You worry about your guy.

90
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,500
Oh, my... I'm so sorry.

91
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,208
I didn't see you, I'm sorry.

92
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:42,708
Hey!

93
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,458
- Well, that's one down.
- How'd you manage that?

94
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:03,458
Mercury vapor, amongst other things.

95
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:15,083
Boarding now.

96
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,292
You better speed things up.

97
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,000
The chopper's about to take off.

98
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:25,375
Bucky!

99
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,625
I don't fly, man. That's your thing.

100
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:55,667
<i>Au revoir!</i>

101
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:07,250
Moving to the rendezvous,
about eight to ten minutes out.

102
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:51,083
Redwing, see if anyone in there
has flight training.

103
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,167
Boss, Lennox ain't responding.

104
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,167
We can still
get out of here before...

105
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,000
No. Diego's in the air.
The trucks are almost here.

106
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,458
Worst case scenario...
we kill the hostages.

107
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,917
- We're supposed to use them to negotiate.
- To stop that vote.

108
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,333
Either way,
our message gets out to the world.

109
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,167
It doesn't even matter if we die.

110
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,708
The movement is strong enough
to continue without us.

111
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,125
Hope for the best. Prepare for the worst.

112
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,750
Hold tight. Move fast.

113
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:42,833
One world.

114
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:48,833
One world.

115
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:50,167
One people.

116
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,292
One people.

117
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,625
One people.

118
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,875
Yeah, man!

119
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,458
Whoo!

120
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,708
We need a diversion.
Give him someone to rescue.

121
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:35,750
- What do you mean?
- Light it up.

122
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,417
- Help! Help us! Help!
- Get over here!

123
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,500
Hold on!

124
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,118
Let's go, get moving!

125
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:02,125
Morgenthau!

126
00:13:07,542 --> 00:13:08,625
Let's finish this.

127
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,708
I didn't mean to kill your friend.

128
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:12,667
I don't wanna hurt people
that don't matter.

129
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,083
You don't think Lemar's life mattered?

130
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:18,708
Not to my fight.

131
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,125
I just want the people on that truck.

132
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:34,792
We gotta get out of here.

133
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,000
Be careful. I've got you.

134
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,500
Go. Go!

135
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,208
Thank you for saving us.

136
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,750
You're welcome.

137
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:09,042
<i>A little birdie told me
you know how to fly a helicopter.</i>

138
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:14,125
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

139
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,458
Whoa!

140
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:35,042
Boy, you just earned this ass-whoopin'.

141
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,917
Okay. What we're gonna do
requires perfect timing.

142
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,708
<i>We're gonna count down from five.</i>

143
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:44,708
When we get to one,
you're gonna grab the control.

144
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:45,917
<i>Okay?</i>

145
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:50,042
Five...

146
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,083
Four...

147
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:53,875
Three...

148
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,375
Two...

149
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,125
Nice work, Ayla.

150
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,875
- Help! Help!
- Somebody help!

151
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,458
No!

152
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,583
Hell, yeah!

153
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,625
That's the Black Falcon there. I tell you.

154
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,500
Nah, that's Captain America.

155
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,458
You of all people
bought into that bullshit?

156
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:56,500
I'm trying something different.
Maybe you should do the same.

157
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:23,500
This way.

158
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,375
Hey, Sharon. We're underground.

159
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,875
We entered the tunnel on William.
Heading south.

160
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:49,250
Looks like they split up. Here.

161
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,125
I got it.

162
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:38,708
Dovich?

163
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:40,792
Dovich, is that you?

164
00:21:43,042 --> 00:21:44,542
Drop your weapon, Karli.

165
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:48,708
I said drop it.

166
00:21:52,417 --> 00:21:53,625
I'm disappointed in you.

167
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:56,917
That's what I was gonna say.

168
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,958
You know, when you came to Madripoor,
you reminded me of a young me.

169
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:13,625
I took you in, gave you an opportunity,

170
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,083
and you betrayed me.

171
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:18,292
Because you wanted
to control a world that hurt you.

172
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,708
But I wanted to change it.

173
00:22:20,542 --> 00:22:22,625
I'm not interested in power or an empire.

174
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,268
- I have bigger dreams.
- What, like this?

175
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:27,500
Come back and work for me again.
All of you.

176
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,292
We can make a difference together.

177
00:22:30,042 --> 00:22:32,250
You just want me
because you need your muscle back.

178
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,875
Without us Super Soldiers, how much power
does the Power Broker really have?

179
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,250
More than you.

180
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,792
So, you're the Power Broker.

181
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,208
You hired Batroc to spy on me.

182
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,458
Karli, you know I'm always prepared.

183
00:22:52,542 --> 00:22:53,833
Get outta my way.

184
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,208
I'm done with these games.

185
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:06,500
Four times. Or...

186
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:10,417
Okay?

187
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:14,458
I don't do blackmail.

188
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:30,458
Sam, stay back.

189
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,292
So, what's next, huh?

190
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:35,042
You kill ten this time,
then, what, a hundred?

191
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:36,750
Where does it end?

192
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,625
Please, let me help you.

193
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:42,000
Don't try and manipulate me.

194
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:44,625
Karli, don't!

195
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:54,667
I'm not gonna fight you!

196
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,042
Karli...

197
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,792
Stay down!

198
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:12,417
No.

199
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,583
The app says it's this way.

200
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,750
Let's go.

201
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:29,000
"Mercy bears
richer fruit than strict justice."

202
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:31,333
It's a great app.

203
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:37,417
Thank you.

204
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:47,708
Lincoln, really?

205
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:49,375
Great man. Great quote.

206
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:50,458
Not when you say it.

207
00:24:53,167 --> 00:24:54,208
Fight back!

208
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,125
Stop it!

209
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:09,250
Fight me! Fight back!

210
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:54,575
I'm sorry.

211
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:21,000
What happened
to the Flag Smashers?

212
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:23,208
When did the government
make you Captain America?

213
00:27:23,292 --> 00:27:26,132
- Is it still Falcon?
- Or is it Captain Falcon?

214
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:29,083
Sam, thank you so much,
from all of us.

215
00:27:29,792 --> 00:27:31,125
Sincerely.

216
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:34,500
You did your part in dealing
with those terrorists, now we'll do ours.

217
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:37,667
Are you still going forward
with resetting the borders?

218
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,500
Our peacekeeping troops
will begin relocating people soon.

219
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:42,875
The terrorists only set us back a bit.

220
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:44,583
Stop calling them terrorists.

221
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:46,500
What else would we call them?

222
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:48,917
Your peacekeeping troops carrying weapons

223
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,458
are forcing millions of people
into settlements around the world, right?

224
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:55,000
What do you think
those people are gonna call you?

225
00:27:56,875 --> 00:28:00,500
These labels,
"terrorists," "refugee," "thug,"

226
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,958
they're often used
to get around the question, why?

227
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:06,750
Those settlements
that happened five years ago,

228
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:11,708
do you think it is fair for governments
to have to support them?

229
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:12,792
Yes.

230
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:14,958
And the people who reappeared

231
00:28:15,042 --> 00:28:17,458
only to find someone else
living in their family home,

232
00:28:17,542 --> 00:28:18,708
they just end up homeless?

233
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:21,250
Look, I get it.

234
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:25,792
But you have no idea
how complicated this situation is.

235
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:28,958
You know what? You're right.

236
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,417
And that's a good thing.

237
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,792
We finally have a common struggle now.

238
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:37,917
Think about that.

239
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:41,542
For once,
all the people who've been begging,

240
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:44,417
and I mean, literally begging for you

241
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,750
to feel how hard any given day is...

242
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:48,583
Now you know.

243
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,000
How did it feel to be helpless?

244
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,333
Now if you could remember
what it was like to be helpless

245
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:59,167
and face a force so powerful
it could erase half the planet,

246
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:04,000
you would know that you're about
to have the exact same impact.

247
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:08,708
This isn't about easy decisions, Senator.

248
00:29:08,792 --> 00:29:09,833
You don't understand.

249
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:13,917
I'm a Black man
carrying the stars and stripes.

250
00:29:14,458 --> 00:29:15,750
What don't I understand?

251
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,958
Every time I pick this thing up,

252
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:23,833
I know there are millions of people
who are gonna hate me for it.

253
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:28,333
Even now, here...

254
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,042
<i>I feel it.</i>

255
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,458
<i>The stares, the judgment.</i>

256
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:35,375
<i>And there's nothin' I can do to change it.</i>

257
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,667
<i>Yet, I'm still here.</i>

258
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:44,042
<i>No super serum,
no blond hair, or blue eyes.</i>

259
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:52,792
The only power I have
is that I believe we can do better.

260
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:59,125
We can't demand that people step up
if we don't meet them halfway.

261
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:01,125
Look, you control the banks.

262
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:05,333
Shit, you can move borders!
You can knock down a forest with an email,

263
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:08,292
<i>you can feed a million people
with a phone call.</i>

264
00:30:09,417 --> 00:30:10,417
<i>But the question is,</i>

265
00:30:11,583 --> 00:30:13,667
<i>who's in the room
when you make those decisions?</i>

266
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:15,208
<i>Hmm?</i>

267
00:30:15,292 --> 00:30:17,083
<i>Is it the people you're gonna impact?</i>

268
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,417
Or is it just more people like you?

269
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:27,542
I mean, this girl died trying to stop you,

270
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:31,125
and no one has stopped
for one second to ask why.

271
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:33,750
You've gotta do better, Senator.

272
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,250
You've gotta step up.

273
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,750
Because if you don't, the next Karli will.

274
00:30:38,542 --> 00:30:40,292
And you don't wanna see 2.0.

275
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:44,042
People believed in her cause so much

276
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:49,625
that they helped her defy
the strongest governments in the world.

277
00:30:51,042 --> 00:30:52,417
Why do you think that is?

278
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:58,750
Look, you people have just as much power
as an insane god

279
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,833
or a misguided teenager.

280
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:05,750
The question you have to ask yourself is,

281
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:08,208
"How are you going to use it?"

282
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:26,792
Sorry, I was, uh, I was texting and so,

283
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:29,542
all I heard was, um,
"a Black guy in stars and stripes."

284
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:33,042
Nice job, Cap.

285
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,208
Thanks.

286
00:31:37,667 --> 00:31:38,792
Sharon?

287
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,792
Blocking my light.

288
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:44,643
We gotta get you to a hospital.

289
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:45,875
She's not gonna listen.

290
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:48,792
It's not the worst thing
that's happened to me all week.

291
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:50,167
Told you.

292
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,333
Uh, Cap?

293
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:54,667
I think
he's talking to you.

294
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:58,000
Look, I'm sorry
for how things ended down there.

295
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:03,083
For what it's worth,
suit looks good on you.

296
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,292
Thanks.

297
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:07,625
All right, look,
can we get out of here, please?

298
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:11,625
I didn't forget my promise.

299
00:32:15,417 --> 00:32:16,417
What's up?

300
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,833
So, we got eyes on the last
Flag Smasher that fell into the Hudson.

301
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:22,000
He's hurt but not down. Can you help?

302
00:32:22,917 --> 00:32:23,958
Always.

303
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,601
<i>Confirming that prisoners
have cleared final processing.</i>

304
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:44,458
<i>We are transporting them to the Raft.</i>

305
00:32:54,792 --> 00:32:56,458
One world. One people.

306
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,684
<i>Four members
of the radical group, the Flag Smashers,</i>

307
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:26,375
<i>were killed today in a car bomb attack</i>

308
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:29,500
<i>as they were being transferred
to a high-security prison.</i>

309
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:31,500
<i>There are no suspects in the bombing.</i>

310
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:34,875
<i>The group had opposed
the global relocation efforts of the GRC,</i>

311
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:36,792
<i>who, just this week, had announced changes</i>

312
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:40,667
<i>in their overall policies
of repatriation and resettlement.</i>

313
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:44,875
Oh!

314
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:48,667
Ooh. Hey, Walker, check your phone.

315
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:55,042
Looks like our friend, Zemo,
kinda got the last laugh, right?

316
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:56,875
Wow.

317
00:33:56,958 --> 00:33:59,458
Couldn't have worked better
if I planned it myself.

318
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:03,625
Oh. Well, maybe I did.
No, I'm kidding, I didn't.

319
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,208
Or did I?

320
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:10,917
Anyway, it's gonna save people
a lot of paperwork

321
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,292
and a lot of redacting
and a lot of shredding.

322
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,000
What is he doing in there?

323
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:24,875
It's probably the helmet.

324
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:28,583
Walker! My God! Let's go!

325
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:38,875
Now, this is more like it.

326
00:34:40,417 --> 00:34:43,167
It's the same, but black.

327
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,833
- Yeah, well...
- Yeah.

328
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,000
Things are about to get weird.

329
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:53,542
So, when they do,
we're not gonna need a Captain America.

330
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:59,208
We're gonna need a U.S. Agent.

331
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,375
- That's great.
- Keep your phone on.

332
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,333
- Will do, Val.
- Don't call me that.

333
00:35:06,417 --> 00:35:07,417
Copy.

334
00:35:07,917 --> 00:35:09,083
Thank you.

335
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,958
U.S. Agent.

336
00:35:15,875 --> 00:35:19,500
I'm back! I'm back! I'm back! I'm back!

337
00:35:42,042 --> 00:35:44,250
Hey, what are you doing here?

338
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,708
It's late,
come in before someone call the cops.

339
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:55,792
What are you doing here?
It's not Wednesday.

340
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:01,417
I, uh, I have to tell you something.

341
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:04,500
About your son.

342
00:36:12,917 --> 00:36:14,167
He was murdered.

343
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,833
What?

344
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:19,708
By the Winter Soldier.

345
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:24,822
And that was me.

346
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:29,000
Why?

347
00:36:32,792 --> 00:36:34,167
I didn't have a choice.

348
00:38:09,208 --> 00:38:10,458
What you want, Black Falcon?

349
00:38:10,542 --> 00:38:12,375
Hey, you need to learn some manners.

350
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,333
He ain't a Falcon anymore,

351
00:38:16,792 --> 00:38:17,917
but he's still Black.

352
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:26,500
I saw what you did out there.

353
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,917
And it seems, so did everyone else.

354
00:38:33,083 --> 00:38:36,667
I heard the GRC was standing down
on those plans of theirs,

355
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,875
so you must have done somethin' right.

356
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,583
I ain't gonna lie.

357
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:47,583
You're special.

358
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,250
Thank you.

359
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:57,292
I mean, you ain't no Malcolm,
Martin, Mandela, but...

360
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:58,458
No argument there.

361
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:00,708
But I know what I've gotta do.

362
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,750
So, a Black Captain America, huh?

363
00:39:07,042 --> 00:39:08,167
Damn right.

364
00:39:11,792 --> 00:39:15,000
The fight you taking on
ain't gonna be easy, Sam.

365
00:39:16,542 --> 00:39:17,583
Yeah, I might fail.

366
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:20,458
Shit, I might die.

367
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:22,458
But...

368
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:24,250
We built this country.

369
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,167
Bled for it.

370
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:30,375
I'm not gonna let
anybody tell me I can't fight for it.

371
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:34,208
Not after what everybody
before me went through.

372
00:39:34,292 --> 00:39:35,542
Including you.

373
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:41,417
Shit.

374
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:43,125
I almost bought that.

375
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,000
Man, do you ever lighten up?

376
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:48,167
Nope.

377
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,333
Mm-mmm.

378
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:55,917
Hey, why don't you clean up?
There's, um...

379
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,833
Somethin' I wanna show you.

380
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,875
So, uh, where we going?

381
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:10,083
Now, they'll never forget
what you did for this country.

382
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:13,125
Never.

383
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,417
Oh! There he is!

384
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:49,875
Where is everybody?

385
00:44:47,958 --> 00:44:51,083
On behalf of
the United States Intelligence Community,

386
00:44:51,167 --> 00:44:54,167
I'd like to offer you
and your family our sincerest apologies.

387
00:44:55,417 --> 00:44:59,000
The Carter name has always been
synonymous with service and trust.

388
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,208
Today, we begin to set things right.

389
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:04,333
We begin to repay
some of the debt that is owed to you.

390
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,125
Thank you, Senator.

391
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:10,208
I've been waiting
to hear those words for a long time.

392
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,208
And we'd like to offer you a full pardon.

393
00:45:14,125 --> 00:45:16,375
There may be
an opening in your old division.

394
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:19,292
Is that something you'd be interested in?

395
00:45:20,792 --> 00:45:21,875
It would be my honor.

396
00:45:23,958 --> 00:45:25,500
Welcome home, Agent Carter.

397
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:46,667
Start lining up our buyers.

398
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:48,583
Super Soldiers might be off the menu,

399
00:45:48,667 --> 00:45:53,333
but we're about to have full access
to government secrets, prototype weapons,

400
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,667
you name it.

401
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,125
Should be something for everyone.
