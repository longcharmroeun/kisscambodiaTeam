1
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:27,375
How does it feel?

2
00:01:30,417 --> 00:01:31,833
Like it's someone else's.

3
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:35,792
It isn't.

4
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,958
The criminal organization
known as LAF

5
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:02,583
is targeting Captain Vasant,
one of our military liaisons.

6
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:04,500
-LAF?
-Yeah, they're high-powered.

7
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,625
We lost contact with Vasant's plane
just after it took off.

8
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:11,750
We need you to make sure
that LAF doesn't deliver on their threat.

9
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,625
Vasant's plane has already entered
Tunisian airspace.

10
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:19,292
US military cannot be seen
operating out there.

11
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,375
I got it.

12
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:24,542
You guys fly low, drop me off,
I fly up to intercept.

13
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,000
No treaties violated.

14
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,500
First Lieutenant Torres,
our intel officer,

15
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:29,958
will be helping on the ground.

16
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:32,583
And Sam, this has to be subtle.

17
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,083
Subtle. Got it.

18
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,250
Sam, Torres here.

19
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:51,875
Sending intel to your HUD right now.

20
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,833
I'll be your boots on the ground, sir.

21
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,292
I got eyes on a plane. Any sign of LAF?

22
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:09,417
Nah. Nothing yet.
But I'll keep tracking the chatter.

23
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:20,750
They've already hijacked the plane.

24
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:23,958
Oh, we're gonna need to call some people.

25
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,208
Okay, switching to plan B.

26
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:48,792
Hey!

27
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,500
Redwing, engage.

28
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:58,208
Captain Vasant? Let's get you out of here.

29
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,542
Sam?

30
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:48,250
Oh!

31
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,292
Redwing, get 'em off our ass!

32
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,042
Keep going! We're close!

33
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,125
If we get to the border,
he's not gonna follow.

34
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:44,250
-What's up?

35
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,542
No!

36
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,875
All right, heads up!
You're about to fly into Libyan airspace.

37
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,833
And I assume
they have a problem with that.

38
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:11,083
Yeah, yeah. A big problem. A big problem.

39
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,458
-How long I got?
-Ninety seconds.

40
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,833
Aw, shit. He's outnumbered.

41
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,208
Sam, we gotta fall back!

42
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:24,292
We got to call it off!
We gotta find another way!

43
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,083
I just did.

44
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,500
Merde!

45
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,333
Whoo!

46
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:53,667
Yeah!

47
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,792
-Thanks.

48
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,333
You could try to reroute that
to the other…

49
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:24,542
Hey, could you not?

50
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,667
Oh.

51
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,708
I've been working with the Air Force
for six months now.

52
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:32,458
Every time ops touches him,
he gets all glitchy.

53
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:34,125
Well, you know, those poor techs

54
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,375
can't keep up
with a billion returning IP addresses

55
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:39,417
-and your sick-ass Stark-level tech.

56
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:41,917
Hey, Avengers.

57
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,458
He knows Arabic.

58
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:55,375
Wait, can you say that again?
Hold on a sec.

59
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,792
-All right. Come on.

60
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:01,542
Anyway, these LAF crews, man,

61
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,583
they're tryin' to take advantage of
all the chaos and make some money.

62
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,833
And that I get, but there's…

63
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,667
Oh, bam! Right there!

64
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,042
You see these guys?
They're guys you gotta worry about.

65
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,958
I've been stumbling onto
their manifestos on message boards.

66
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,417
They're called the Flag Smashers.

67
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,083
Is that a new thing?
Bad guys give themselves bad names.

68
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,125
There's a lot worse names than that one.

69
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:26,167
But basically, they think that
the world was better during The Blip.

70
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,750
Trust me, it wasn't.

71
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:32,417
Trust me. Every time something
gets better for one group,

72
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,792
it gets worse for another.

73
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:38,500
Yeah. Essentially, these people, they want
a world that's unified without borders.

74
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,750
So, you could see
why a lot of people are into that.

75
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,958
Yeah, but keep an eye on it.

76
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,750
If anything gets serious, you let me know.

77
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,125
No doubt. I'll… I'll, uh…

78
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,208
I'll track the online chatter,
see what they're saying. Yeah.

79
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:52,708
I do gotta ask you, though,

80
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:56,542
'cause online there's just been
a lot of stuff about Steve, actually.

81
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,875
Um, crazy, crazy conspiracy theories.

82
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,250
So, some people…

83
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:05,083
Some people, they think
that he's in a secret base on the moon

84
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:06,833
looking down over us.

85
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:08,625
Yeah. Well, I can assure you,

86
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,833
those people,
you don't have to take seriously.

87
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:13,583
But you didn't, like…

88
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,583
fly him to the moon?

89
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:17,250
-Nah.
-Oh…

90
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,250
Had to check.

91
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,667
Oh, oh, I got you, man.

92
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,375
-Thanks. I'll get you back next time.
-All right.

93
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,542
-So, where are you off to?
-Washington.

94
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,792
What are you doin' there?

95
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,667
Moon stuff.

96
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,333
Oh!

97
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:44,292
Steve represented
the best in all of us.

98
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,500
Courageous, righteous, hopeful.

99
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:52,708
And he mastered posing stoically.

100
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,167
The world has been forever changed.

101
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,667
A few months ago,

102
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,417
billions of people
reappeared after five years away,

103
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,292
sending the world into turmoil.

104
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:13,000
We need new heroes.

105
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,042
Ones suited for the times we're in.

106
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:21,000
Symbols…

107
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:26,125
are nothing without the women and men
that give them meaning.

108
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:28,750
And this thing…

109
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,458
I don't know if there's ever been
a greater symbol.

110
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,458
But it's more about the man
who propped it up,

111
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,375
and he's gone.

112
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:48,625
So, today we honor Steve's legacy.
But also, we look to the future.

113
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:54,458
So, thank you, Captain America.

114
00:13:58,167 --> 00:13:59,750
But this belongs to you.

115
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,625
Thanks again for coming forward
with the shield, Sam.

116
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,042
It was the right decision.

117
00:14:29,792 --> 00:14:30,792
Take a walk?

118
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,292
Yeah, I've been at home.

119
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,000
My sister and my nephews, man.

120
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:40,625
When I left, they were babies.
I come back and they're little men.

121
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,083
-It's crazy, you know?
-Yeah.

122
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,417
Well, you should bring 'em out
to D.C. sometime.

123
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,708
I'll teach 'em how to fly.

124
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,500
-You know, I mean, the right way.

125
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,083
Crazy that nobody's
gonna be carryin' the shield.

126
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:53,417
Hey, we went
for 70 years without anybody

127
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,042
carryin' it when Steve was on ice.

128
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:56,542
So, I think we'll be all right.

129
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,542
That was a different time, Sam.

130
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:01,875
I see you're gonna make me ask.

131
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:07,500
Why didn't you take up the mantle?

132
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:12,458
When Steve first told me about the shield,

133
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:15,458
the first words I said were,

134
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,625
"It feels like it belongs
to someone else."

135
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:19,875
Hmm.

136
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,125
That someone else is Steve.

137
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,708
World's a crazy place right now.

138
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,500
People are…

139
00:15:32,917 --> 00:15:34,208
Well, nobody's stable.

140
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,667
Allies are now enemies.

141
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,583
Alliances are all torn apart.

142
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:44,917
The world's broken.

143
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,583
Everybody's just looking
for somebody to fix it.

144
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:50,208
Yeah.

145
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,417
It's a new day, brother.

146
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,125
I'll be in touch.

147
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,292
I mean… Thank you.

148
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,083
-Oh… Well, that's done.
-Yeah.

149
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,417
Half hour before last call?

150
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,750
I can't, guys.
I have to prep for tomorrow's session.

151
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,000
-Really?
-You…

152
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,167
Ooh!

153
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:29,958
Hail HYDRA.

154
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:42,958
Shit.

155
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:54,958
Please.

156
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,083
I didn't see anything.

157
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,708
I didn't see anything.

158
00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:03,875
I didn't see anything.

159
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,792
So, Mr. Barnes,
are you still having nightmares?

160
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,667
James, I asked you a question.

161
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,292
Are you still having nightmares?

162
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,333
No.

163
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:31,250
We've been doing this long enough
that I can tell when you're lying.

164
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,292
Well, you seem a little off today.

165
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,708
Did something happen recently?

166
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,750
No.

167
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:41,958
You're a civilian now.

168
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,333
With your history, the government
needs to know that you're not gonna…

169
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,833
It's a condition of your pardon.

170
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,000
So, tell me about
your most recent nightmare.

171
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:00,875
I didn't have a nightmare.

172
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,292
Oh, come on. Really?

173
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,125
You're gonna do the notebook thing?

174
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,917
Why? It's passive aggressive.

175
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:13,875
You don't talk. I write.

176
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,292
Okay. Okay.

177
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,375
I crossed a name off
the list of my amends yesterday.

178
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:24,042
Don't worry. I used all your three rules.

179
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,458
Senator Atwood.

180
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,958
She was a HYDRA pawn for years.

181
00:19:31,292 --> 00:19:33,708
Helped her get into office
when I was the Winter Soldier.

182
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,917
And after HYDRA disbanded,

183
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,750
she continued to abuse
the power I gave her.

184
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,000
Make this go away.

185
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,542
If Congressman Lockhart wants to speak up,
silence him for good.

186
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:55,958
So, rule number one,
you can't do anything illegal.

187
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:00,792
What the hell?

188
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,500
All I did was give some intel
to the aide to convict her.

189
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,292
And I wasn't involved in anything else.

190
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:14,375
Rule number two?

191
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,083
What was rule number two?

192
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:18,583
Nobody gets hurt. It's a big one.

193
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:20,292
Then why isn't it rule number one?

194
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,125
I didn't hurt anybody.

195
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,667
Come on!

196
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:26,417
Remember me?

197
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I promise.

198
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,208
And what about
rule number three?

199
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:39,958
The whole point of making amends
is to fulfill rule number three.

200
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:41,458
You know, you're a cynic, Doc.

201
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,417
Of course, I completed rule number three.

202
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,250
I am no longer the Winter Soldier.

203
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,583
I am James Bucky Barnes…

204
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:51,542
And you're part of my efforts
to make amends.

205
00:20:55,583 --> 00:21:01,458
So, you did it all right,
but it didn't help with the nightmares.

206
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:03,625
Well, like I said, I didn't have any.

207
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Look…

208
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:11,083
one day, you're gonna have to open up

209
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:15,458
and understand that some people
really do want to help you

210
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:17,250
and that they can be trusted.

211
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,917
I trust people.

212
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,583
Yeah? Give me your phone.

213
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,500
You don't have ten phone numbers
on this thing.

214
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:37,042
Oh, and you've been
ignoring the texts from Sam.

215
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,708
Look, you've gotta nurture friendships.

216
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:43,667
I am the only person
you have called all week.

217
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,083
-That is so sad.

218
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:48,042
You're alone.

219
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,875
You're a hundred years old.

220
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,167
You have no history, no family…

221
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,542
Are you lashing out at me, Doc?

222
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,125
Because that's
really unprofessional, you know?

223
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,667
When did that start?
Yelling at your clients?

224
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,625
The notebook. That's great.

225
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:04,125
All right, give me a break.
I'm trying, okay?

226
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,208
This isn't…

227
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,958
This is new for me.

228
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:10,667
I didn't have a moment
to deal with anything, you know?

229
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,958
I had a little…

230
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:15,958
calm in Wakanda.

231
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:22,042
And other than that, I just went
from one fight to another for 90 years.

232
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:29,250
So, now that you've stopped fighting,

233
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:31,667
what do you want?

234
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,125
Peace.

235
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,208
That is utter bullshit.

236
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,833
You're a terrible shrink.

237
00:22:41,917 --> 00:22:43,833
I was an excellent soldier,

238
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:47,583
so I saw a lot of dead bodies,
and I know how that can shut you down.

239
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:50,375
And if you are alone,

240
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:54,000
that is the quietest, most personal hell.

241
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,667
And, James, it is very hard to escape.

242
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:03,875
Look, I know that
you have been through a lot,

243
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,708
but you've got your mind back,

244
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:09,708
you are being pardoned.

245
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:11,958
I mean, these are good things.

246
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,208
You're free.

247
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:21,667
To do what?

248
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,500
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

249
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,042
What? What?

250
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:36,167
Your can isn't even half full.
Why don't we just share?

251
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,833
-What?
-You don't gotta body me, Yori.

252
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,500
-It's Mr. Nakajima.
-Okay.

253
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:42,125
-Mr. Nakajima!
-Okay. Mr. Nakajima.

254
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:45,792
Hey! Hey! Yori, what's goin' on?
I thought we're getting lunch.

255
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:48,125
Unique is putting his trash into my trash.

256
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:49,208
It's trash.

257
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:51,375
-And the time has come for me to smack…
-Whoa!

258
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:53,292
-It's just trash.
-Hang on.

259
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,000
Hey, man. I'm Unique.

260
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:57,708
It's like Monique, but it's got
a "U" in there for uniqueness.

261
00:23:57,792 --> 00:23:59,208
-That's absurd.
-Okay, sorry.

262
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:01,625
Yori, you can't keep
fighting with your neighbors.

263
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,542
-Come on, let's get some food.
-No, go away.

264
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,792
But Izzy.
We always go to Izzy on Wednesday.

265
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:08,042
-I'm not in the mood today.
-Hey, what if I buy?

266
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:12,208
Fine, but no talking.

267
00:24:13,792 --> 00:24:14,792
Take a look.

268
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:18,792
Nobody made it past 90 this week.

269
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,292
So young. Such a shame.

270
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:25,250
You guys didn't order the usual, huh?
Feeling a little adventurous?

271
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:28,917
You should ask her out.

272
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:31,542
Mm-mmm…

273
00:24:32,917 --> 00:24:35,000
He would like to take you out on a date.

274
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:38,417
Maybe to bingo or a night of pinochle?

275
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,500
Pinochle. Yeah.

276
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:42,375
-I'm really sorry about him.
-Why are you sorry?

277
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:44,875
-I'm game.
-Wow.

278
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:47,667
-Tomorrow night, then?
-Tomorrow night's great.

279
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,292
Just maybe not pinochle.

280
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:51,042
-What's wrong with pinochle?
-Yeah.

281
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:52,250
I have a shift,

282
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:55,167
but if you wanna come back here,
I should be done around 10:00.

283
00:24:58,917 --> 00:25:00,375
I can't believe you did that.

284
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,833
It's a dance to these things.

285
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:06,208
You can't… You gotta warm up
and I haven't danced since 1943…

286
00:25:06,292 --> 00:25:07,292
it feels like.

287
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
What's wrong?

288
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:32,500
He had a job with a consulting company.

289
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:34,125
And, uh,

290
00:25:34,792 --> 00:25:38,667
he was working abroad and he was killed.

291
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,333
The police said
"Wrong place, wrong time," but…

292
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:47,333
I will never know
what really happened to him.

293
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:51,583
I felt it was strange.

294
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:53,625
In here.

295
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:34,708
This, too, Mom?

296
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:35,958
Yeah, all of it, baby.

297
00:26:36,042 --> 00:26:37,917
And we're taking that one
to the soup kitchen.

298
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,708
So, put that one over there.

299
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:43,375
Blue for the snapper,
orange for the whitefish.

300
00:26:44,792 --> 00:26:45,958
Uncle Sam!

301
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:47,667
What's up?

302
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:49,208
That's right!

303
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:52,583
Uncle Sam, you're back early.

304
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:57,000
What's goin' on?
You got Mom's sneaky look on your face.

305
00:26:57,083 --> 00:27:00,417
How you gonna try to read me
when you know I'm the one that reads you?

306
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:04,125
You gotta marvel at it.

307
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:07,875
Baby being held together
by duct tape and prayers.

308
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:11,208
It'll be fine. It just needs to float
long enough for me to sell it.

309
00:27:11,292 --> 00:27:13,875
I thought we were gonna discuss
if we were selling it.

310
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:15,000
We did.

311
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:17,625
And then you were off fighting
Doctor Space Cape or whatever

312
00:27:17,708 --> 00:27:20,083
while I was holdin' it together
for five long years.

313
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:22,000
Now that the world
is going back to normal,

314
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,083
this thing's gotta go.

315
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:25,208
We grew up on this thing.

316
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:28,208
It's not just Mom and Dad's
name on it, Sarah.

317
00:27:28,292 --> 00:27:29,958
This thing is a part of our family.

318
00:27:30,042 --> 00:27:31,667
You know the situation we're in.

319
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,875
This is why I prefer
not to dwell on it in front of everybody.

320
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:36,625
Well, what if we don't have to sell it?

321
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:38,042
Can I talk to you?

322
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:41,125
-What's good, Big Sam?
-Oh! What's goin' on, man?

323
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:44,042
-I'm trying to live like you.
-You know it.

324
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:45,750
-Off to save the world again?
-Nah.

325
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:47,833
Come on, Carlos.
I'm around here more than you.

326
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:49,083
I'm always reppin' NOLA.

327
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,333
When you gonna let me
borrow the wings, man?

328
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:54,167
As soon as you give my sister back
that $100 you borrowed.

329
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:57,208
-That's cold. Now, loan me a hot $50.
-Yeah. I'll loan you $50.

330
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:07,333
-Sam, the boat's gotta go.
-Wait.

331
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:08,708
No, let me finish.

332
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:11,208
I'm doin' everything I can
to keep this business afloat.

333
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:13,375
And every day I'm making $5,
and spending $10.

334
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:16,417
-So, why won't you let me help?
-No, don't start with that.

335
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,083
We made a deal before Daddy died.

336
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:20,333
You're out there. I do things my way here.

337
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:23,667
Right. But you tangled the house
into this when you took those loans.

338
00:28:26,917 --> 00:28:28,250
Forgot how hard you hit.

339
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:29,875
Sarah!

340
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:33,833
Look, and don't hit me again.

341
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,542
What if you had money to fix it up,

342
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:40,708
make it nice so you can charter it
when you're not out working the waters?

343
00:28:40,792 --> 00:28:43,833
Do you know how hard it was for me
to come to terms with the situation?

344
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:46,000
Why would you dig this up?

345
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,583
We can take a loan
and consolidate everything.

346
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:51,125
It'll take down your monthly.

347
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,333
-What?
-You think I didn't try the banks?

348
00:28:54,417 --> 00:28:56,375
They're in with all that big business.

349
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:58,000
Yeah. But now you have me.

350
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:00,250
Don't, Sam.

351
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:02,125
-I just got good with this.
-All right.

352
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:05,417
-Maybe it is time for us to move on.
-Either way, just let me help.

353
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,125
I'll set the appointment.

354
00:29:08,542 --> 00:29:11,542
Look, I won't let you down.
We can turn this shit around.

355
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:12,625
Trust me.

356
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,083
To the rescue?

357
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:18,750
Always.

358
00:29:19,292 --> 00:29:21,375
Now, let's get some dinner. I'm hungry.

359
00:29:49,917 --> 00:29:52,000
Well,
if that's not the most adorably

360
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:54,375
old-fashioned thing
anyone's ever done.

361
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:02,667
Grab a seat, I'll be done in a few.

362
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,833
Okay.

363
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:10,250
So, have you dated much since
half the fish in the sea came back?

364
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:12,333
Not really.

365
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:14,125
I, um…

366
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,833
tried the whole online dating thing.

367
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:19,083
It's pretty crazy.

368
00:30:20,542 --> 00:30:21,750
A lot of weird pictures.

369
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,208
What kind of weird?

370
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:26,417
I mean, tiger photos?

371
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:29,667
Half the time I don't even know
what I'm looking at. It's…

372
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:31,333
It's a lot.

373
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:34,625
You sound like my dad.

374
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:35,750
Mmm…

375
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:38,125
Wait, how old are you?

376
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:39,750
A hundred and six.

377
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:46,583
What's up with your gloves?

378
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:48,458
I, um…

379
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,333
have, uh…

380
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,000
Poor circulation.

381
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:54,208
Hmm…

382
00:30:56,417 --> 00:30:58,167
-Let's play a game.
-Yeah.

383
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,458
-You like games?
-Love 'em.

384
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:03,625
We keep some games around
for boring shifts.

385
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:05,292
I'll go grab a couple of beers.

386
00:31:18,542 --> 00:31:19,542
What are you doing?

387
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:21,208
I'm reading your mind.

388
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:23,333
Please don't.

389
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,042
B-8, sucker.

390
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:28,417
-Uh, hit!

391
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:32,000
-Drink! Come on, drink.

392
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,167
All right. Okay.

393
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:36,375
Wow, you really can drink.

394
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:38,292
Yeah, well…

395
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:39,958
Do you have any siblings?

396
00:31:40,042 --> 00:31:41,625
I have a sister. F-4.

397
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:43,000
Miss. Drink.

398
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,417
Are you close with your parents?

399
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,958
I was.

400
00:31:48,042 --> 00:31:49,083
They passed away.

401
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:51,625
Um, D-5.

402
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:53,250
Oh, I'm sorry.

403
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:55,167
Um, miss.

404
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:59,667
I think it's really sweet
you're spending time with Yori.

405
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:03,542
It's been hard for him his son died.

406
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,917
I think not knowing how it happened
is the hardest part for him.

407
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:10,958
Mmm, it really messed him up.

408
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:16,375
You know how you call a guy
whose wife died a widower?

409
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:19,125
Or, if your parents die, you're an orphan.

410
00:32:20,167 --> 00:32:24,792
You know, there's no word
for someone whose kids die.

411
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:27,417
Because it's the worst thing
that could happen.

412
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,792
Yeah, excuse me.

413
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:30,333
You good?

414
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,167
Hey, what are you doing here?

415
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:48,458
How was the date?

416
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:58,292
It was… It was good.

417
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,833
Forgot I owed you for lunch.

418
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:31,917
There we go.

419
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,417
Get the plates moving.
Get some rice in there. Come on.

420
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,000
Oh, lined up perfectly.

421
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:38,167
You always gotta do the most, huh?

422
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,750
I don't play
with these White folks.

423
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:44,792
Look, I know you're worried, all right?
But I did the research. I ran the numbers.

424
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:46,917
-You think this is gonna work?
-I know it will.

425
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,417
And then we can renovate the kitchen.

426
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,875
Now, you said you wanted
to sell plates on the weekends, right?

427
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:56,292
That's great. You can introduce
some of Grandma's recipes and…

428
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:57,875
Shit. We gotta go.

429
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:00,333
Wait, the appointment's in an hour.

430
00:34:00,417 --> 00:34:04,792
There's no such thing as on time.
You're either early or late. Pick one.

431
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:07,500
Okay. Now you're
really doing more than the most.

432
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:09,208
All right, boys, I love you.

433
00:34:09,292 --> 00:34:14,208
Now, Mr. Liu's gonna watch over you
and no video games.

434
00:34:14,292 --> 00:34:15,958
-Love you. Bye.
-Bye.

435
00:34:16,042 --> 00:34:17,833
Yes, video games.

436
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,625
-Three, two, one.

437
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:24,125
Go, go, go!

438
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,333
He's getting away!

439
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:49,833
Sorry. Uh…

440
00:35:58,583 --> 00:36:00,542
Hey, hey, hey!

441
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:05,292
I don't know how jurisdiction works here,
but I'mma have to place you under arrest.

442
00:36:29,292 --> 00:36:32,167
Sorry, I keep thinking.
Did you used to play for LSU?

443
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,167
-Do I know you from somewhere?

444
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,375
I don't know. Do you?

445
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:37,542
I do. But where?

446
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:39,125
Come on.

447
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:43,833
-I knew it. Falcon!
-Yeah!

448
00:36:43,917 --> 00:36:47,042
Yes! Yes! Man! Oh…

449
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:49,417
I didn't want to say anything. You know…

450
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,167
I always wanted to be an Avenger.

451
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,958
Oh, man, it's a dream come true, you know?

452
00:36:54,042 --> 00:36:55,042
That's amazing.

453
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:57,208
Like, keeping my family's business afloat

454
00:36:57,292 --> 00:36:59,875
by changin' to
a fishin' and charter model.

455
00:36:59,958 --> 00:37:02,542
I've always wondered…
How do you guys make a living?

456
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:05,958
Those guys or the guy sitting
in front of you tryin' to get a loan?

457
00:37:06,042 --> 00:37:07,375
Both.

458
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:09,792
I mean, your financials
are all over the place.

459
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:11,792
Is there some kind of fund for heroes?

460
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:13,583
Or did Stark pay you when he was around?

461
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:14,875
My condolences, by the way.

462
00:37:14,958 --> 00:37:17,208
Thank you, but no,
it doesn't really work like that.

463
00:37:17,292 --> 00:37:19,458
There's a tremendous amount of goodwill

464
00:37:19,542 --> 00:37:23,083
and because of that,
people are inclined to help,

465
00:37:23,167 --> 00:37:25,625
-which applies to the business.
-Yeah, right.

466
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:28,250
But were you living off
of goodwill this whole time?

467
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:30,250
I don't get what you're going for here.

468
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:33,292
Are you trying to help us,
or indict us?

469
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:36,583
You have no income
over the last five years.

470
00:37:36,667 --> 00:37:38,417
How can you have income
if you don't exist?

471
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,500
Sarah.

472
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:42,333
Uh…

473
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:47,375
I've been gone
like several billion other people.

474
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:48,958
But if you look at our plan,

475
00:37:49,042 --> 00:37:52,125
I have government contracts,
so, that's proof of earnings.

476
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:55,208
And I know for a fact
that we qualify for a SBA loan.

477
00:37:55,292 --> 00:37:57,333
Under the old terms, sure.

478
00:37:57,417 --> 00:38:00,000
But these days, what,
with everyone just showing up,

479
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:02,125
well, things tightened up.

480
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:04,833
Funny how things always tighten around us.

481
00:38:04,917 --> 00:38:08,583
Easy there. Look, I'm on your side.
After all, he's a hero.

482
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:12,083
Is there any chance,
and you could say "no,"

483
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:14,167
that I could get a selfie
with your arms out?

484
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,250
-Are you serious?

485
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:21,083
Mr. Wilson, Mrs. Wilson…

486
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:23,167
Miss. I'm a widow.

487
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,792
Ms. Wilson.

488
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:29,208
I know your family
has banked with us for generations,

489
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:30,792
but we cannot approve you.

490
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:33,708
I'm truly sorry.

491
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:42,917
We're gonna get that loan. I don't care
if I have to go to every bank in the city.

492
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,125
Sam, stop!
I don't want to deal with this again.

493
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:46,958
That's what life is,
dealing with things.

494
00:38:47,042 --> 00:38:50,500
You are so out of pocket for that.
Don't forget, you joined the Air Force.

495
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:52,875
You didn't see everything
Mom and Daddy dealt with.

496
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:56,292
I knew they weren't gonna help us.
It's not their job.

497
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,833
Those people don't know who Daddy was,
and he was a giant.

498
00:38:58,917 --> 00:39:00,542
I don't care. I'm not gonna quit.

499
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:03,250
What are you trying to prove?
And who you trying to prove it to?

500
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:05,917
-I swear, after Daddy died…
-I knew that was gonna come up.

501
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,042
I never hid what I thought. You had
to go off and fight armies and monsters.

502
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:11,125
And I appreciate that,

503
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:14,083
but you don't get to come back here
and try to right your wrongs

504
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:16,833
just because you couldn't
deal with what was going on here.

505
00:39:16,917 --> 00:39:19,167
You don't know what happened
these last five years.

506
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,958
I was alone with two babies
and I survived.

507
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:24,417
I'm the one
who kept that boat from sinkin'.

508
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,000
Yeah, well, half the boat's mine
and so is the house.

509
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:29,208
We're not sellin' our family's legacy.

510
00:39:29,292 --> 00:39:31,417
You gonna do me like that
when you know I'm right?

511
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,583
Yep!

512
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:40,250
Okay.

513
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:49,542
Oh!

514
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:54,208
Come on, baby.
What you got for me?

515
00:39:58,042 --> 00:39:59,125
Come on! Come on!

516
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:02,208
Shit!

517
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,708
So, this is the leader
of the Flag Smashers, huh?

518
00:40:40,792 --> 00:40:42,125
Yeah, real nice guy.

519
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:45,125
I thought you were
supposed to be monitoring them online.

520
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:46,708
I was. I did.

521
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:49,000
But you know sometimes you gotta
get your hands dirty,

522
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:50,583
-or a broken orbital.

523
00:40:50,667 --> 00:40:52,417
You're lucky that's all you got.

524
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,083
He's strong.

525
00:40:54,167 --> 00:40:57,250
He was. I mean, bro,
they went dark as soon as it was all over.

526
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:58,333
But that's their M.O.

527
00:40:58,417 --> 00:41:01,458
We gotta keep our eyes and ears
to the ground till they pop up again.

528
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,458
Anything else happen outside the video?

529
00:41:03,542 --> 00:41:06,917
No, man. My face was in the dirt
before I knew what was happening.

530
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:09,292
Why? What are you thinking?

531
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:11,958
Nothin'.

532
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:15,375
Wait. You don't think he could be a…

533
00:41:15,458 --> 00:41:17,125
Look, I'll circle back to you.

534
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:20,000
-Let's keep this between me and you, okay?
-All right.

535
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:22,583
Oh, my God, Sam.
You better look at this.

536
00:41:22,667 --> 00:41:25,042
Unrest,
in the wake of recent events

537
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:26,875
has left us vulnerable.

538
00:41:27,417 --> 00:41:29,625
Every day Americans feel it.

539
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:35,000
While we love heroes who put
their lives on the line to defend Earth,

540
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:37,792
we also need a hero
to defend this country.

541
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:44,000
We need a real person
who embodies America's greatest values.

542
00:41:44,958 --> 00:41:48,417
We need someone to inspire us again,

543
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:53,167
someone who can be a symbol for all of us.

544
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:58,292
So, on behalf of the Department of Defense
and our Commander-in-Chief,

545
00:41:58,375 --> 00:42:02,042
it is with great honor
that we announce here today

546
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:07,042
that the United States of America
has a new hero.

547
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:10,583
Join me in welcoming
your new Captain America.
