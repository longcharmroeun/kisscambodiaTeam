1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,917
<i>He is gone.</i>

2
00:00:11,417 --> 00:00:12,417
Uncle Sam!

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,167
Sam, the boat's gotta go.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,750
I'm doin' everything I can
to keep this business afloat.

5
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,833
And every day I'm making $5,
and spending $10.

6
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:21,125
That shield is a monument to a bygone era.

7
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:24,083
A reminder of all the
people history just left out.

8
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:27,083
If anything, that shield should be destroyed.

9
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:28,875
I heard what became of Sokovia.

10
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:32,083
I don't suppose any of you
bothered visiting the memorial?

11
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,375
Of course not.

12
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:37,167
<i>So you're telling me that
there was a black Super Soldier</i>

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,000
<i>decades ago and nobody knew about it?</i>

14
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,167
You know what they did to me?

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,375
They put my ass in jail for 30 years.

16
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:45,792
Why'd you give up that shield?

17
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:48,667
Can you accept that I
did what I thought was right?

18
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,583
Karli Morgenthau,
you're under arrest.

19
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:52,208
-This is what that was?
-No, wait…

20
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:54,583
-Tricking me until help came?
-We've spoken enough.

21
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:56,792
-You Nazi.
-Why don't you…

22
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:59,250
<i>If you had the chance to
take the serum, would you?</i>

23
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:00,333
<i>Hells, yeah.</i>

24
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:02,125
You wouldn't worry about it changing you?

25
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:07,042
Power just makes a person
more of themselves, right?

26
00:01:10,042 --> 00:01:11,417
Hey, Lemar.

27
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,292
Lemar. Lemar. Lemar.

28
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,750
It wasn't me!

29
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:19,625
It wasn't me!

30
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:16,667
Wasn't me!

31
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,000
You told me.

32
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,917
You didn't want me to go in.

33
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,792
-Why didn't I listen?
-You all right, man?

34
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:54,042
<i>This suit, it comes
with expectations, brother.</i>

35
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,458
Why?

36
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,458
Look, John, I know you want this.
I get it.

37
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:02,500
<i>You consistently make the right
decisions in the heat of battle.</i>

38
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:12,458
<i>Time to go to work.</i>

39
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:35,958
Time to go to work.

40
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,417
Walker…

41
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,583
You guys should see a medic,
you don't look so good.

42
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:45,667
Stop, Walker.

43
00:03:48,167 --> 00:03:49,500
What?

44
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,292
You saw what happened.
You know what I had to do.

45
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:56,250
I killed him because I had to!
He killed Lemar!

46
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,625
He didn't kill Lemar, John.

47
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:02,833
Don't go down that road.
Believe me, it doesn't end well.

48
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:03,917
I'm not like you.

49
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,708
Listen, it was the heat of the battle. Okay?

50
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:10,833
If you explain what happened,
they may consider your record.

51
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,167
We don't want anyone else to get hurt.

52
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,375
John…

53
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,917
You gotta give me the shield, man.

54
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,083
Oh,

55
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:37,875
so that's what this is.

56
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,792
You almost got me.

57
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,000
You made a mistake.

58
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,250
You don't wanna do this.

59
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,458
Yeah, we do.

60
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:45,875
Why are you making me do this?

61
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,458
Why are you making me do this?

62
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,583
This isn't you, John.

63
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,208
We could've been a team.

64
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,583
I am Captain America!

65
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,375
No!

66
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:38,625
It's mine.

67
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:40,833
It's over, John.

68
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:41,917
It's mine.

69
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:20,417
The GRC is conducting
raids to try and find Karli,

70
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,167
but so far they've only found her followers.

71
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,833
They've searched this camp,

72
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:28,417
and just like the last camp, nothing.

73
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,875
She's gone. We'll never find her.

74
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,292
Hey, you got your sleeve back.

75
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:40,167
Are you off to take care of Zemo?

76
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,208
All right, good to know you survived.

77
00:09:47,042 --> 00:09:49,417
What's our next steps, Torres?

78
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,833
Captain America killing a
foreign national in public,

79
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:54,292
it's kinda like a big deal.

80
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:58,042
Like international incident big.

81
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:03,375
Folks, uh, higher up on the payroll
are all over it now. So, unfortunately…

82
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,000
They're taking jurisdiction.

83
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,583
Yeah.

84
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,292
What happened to these?

85
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,500
-So is there anything we can do?
-Not really.

86
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,458
As you can see, they've cordoned off
the whole camp, and Karli's a ghost.

87
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:27,583
After what went down,
she is laying extra low.

88
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:29,500
Like, under-underground.

89
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:32,042
And that's why it makes
sense for us to get involved.

90
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:35,000
The longer we let her regroup,
the harder it's gonna be to find her.

91
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:39,792
She's got people helping her from
all over the world, on all platforms.

92
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:43,125
She's really, really good at this thing.

93
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,292
Yeah.

94
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,625
How'd these break?

95
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:54,083
Anyway, all we can do now
is sit tight and just chill.

96
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:57,542
Sometimes, there's nothing to
do until there's something to do.

97
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,333
That's bizarrely wise.

98
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,000
-Well, I'm a bizarrely wise man, Sam.
-Yeah, all right.

99
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,500
-Thanks, Torres.
-For sure.

100
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:16,500
Wait, yo, you forgot the wings.

101
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:18,750
Keep 'em.

102
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:37,250
<i>John F. Walker,
it is the order of this council</i>

103
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,792
<i>that you are no longer
to act in any capacity</i>

104
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:44,458
<i>as a representative of the United
States government or its military.</i>

105
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:49,083
<i>You are hereby stripped of your
title and authority as Captain America,</i>

106
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,917
effective immediately.

107
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,458
Senator, uh, permission to
present to the council testimony

108
00:11:56,542 --> 00:11:58,708
as to the circumstances of the incident.

109
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:01,542
Circumstances of the
incident have been considered.

110
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:06,042
It's only because of your previous
exemplary service to this country

111
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,000
that I'm recommending
against a court-martial.

112
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,583
With all due respect,

113
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:14,583
I don't think you understand
the gravity of the situation fully,

114
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,833
thereby, have misunderstood
the circumstances…

115
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:19,042
-This is not a negotiation.
-I understand that.

116
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,500
-This is a mandate.
-I'm just asking to be heard.

117
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:22,667
It is a mandate.

118
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,333
I understand that!
I understand that!

119
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:34,375
I lived my life by your mandates!
I dedicated my life to your mandates!

120
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:38,000
I only ever did what you asked of me,

121
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:43,167
what you told me to be and
trained me to do, and I did it.

122
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,000
And I did it well.

123
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,750
You will be given

124
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:54,500
an other than honorable discharge
retroactive to the beginning of the month.

125
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:58,792
You will hold no rank in
retirement and receive no benefits.

126
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,583
You built me.

127
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:16,792
Senator, I am Captain America.

128
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,333
Not anymore.

129
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:24,125
And if you continue to demean and denigrate

130
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,667
the priorities and dignity of this council,

131
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,708
you will spend the rest of your
life in the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks.

132
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:34,125
Consider yourself extremely fortunate,
Mr. Walker,

133
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:37,708
and return the shield to us with expedience.

134
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,167
They just do not know what
it takes to be Captain America,

135
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,083
they just don't.

136
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:55,167
-It's not like I'm just gonna disappear.
-Okay, focus.

137
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:00,500
Take things one step at a time.
You start by visiting Lemar's parents.

138
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:04,792
They need to see you.
And then, we can build…

139
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:21,208
Well, these boots are not made for walkin'.

140
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:23,875
Valentina Allegra de Fontaine.

141
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:28,333
Actually, it's Contessa
Valentina Allegra de Fontaine.

142
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:31,250
I know it's hard,
but I don't like to repeat myself,

143
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,875
so you can just call me Val.

144
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,750
But don't call me Val,
just keep it in your head.

145
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:37,833
I'm gonna…

146
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:41,000
Look…

147
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,167
I would have killed the bastard too.

148
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,708
Nobody in there is mad at you about that.

149
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:49,625
I mean, you would've been doin' 'em a favor

150
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,958
if you'd taken out the whole lot.

151
00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:58,167
But these guys in ties, you know,
they got a whole thing to protect.

152
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,542
Excuse me. Who are you?

153
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:04,833
Anyway, you did the right thing

154
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:06,208
taking the serum.

155
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:09,000
Yeah, of course I know about that.
And I'll tell you something.

156
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:13,250
It has made you very,
very valuable to certain people.

157
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,083
I actually think it
was the second best choice

158
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:18,208
you've ever made in your life.

159
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,667
Oh, you wanna know what
the first best choice was?

160
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:22,542
Oh…

161
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,083
Tied with marrying

162
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:26,917
this fabulous firecracker
sitting right next to me.

163
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,875
How's it going?

164
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,917
Picking up the phone when I call you.

165
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:36,750
Oh, by the way,
don't worry about the shield.

166
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,083
I know you don't have it.

167
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:42,875
Here's a little,
dirty state secret.

168
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,500
It doesn't really belong to the government.

169
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,125
It's kind of a legal gray area.

170
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:54,750
I'll be in touch.

171
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:07,000
There's… There's nothing on it.

172
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,667
It says here the GRC accused them

173
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,042
of harboring and
abetting international fugitives,

174
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:51,167
so they raided the place and shut it down.

175
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,667
Mathias.

176
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,833
Mama Donya.

177
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,292
Nico.

178
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,333
I've lost count of how many others.

179
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,375
How many times do we
have to pay with our lives

180
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,250
just to be citizens of this goddamn planet!

181
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,417
The movement is ready.

182
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,167
They're not going to stop.

183
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,958
Not unless we make them.

184
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:26,333
It's time.

185
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,750
I thought you'd be here sooner.

186
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:04,917
Don't worry.

187
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,458
I've decided I'm not going to kill you.

188
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:11,000
Imagine my relief.

189
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:20,750
The girl has been
radicalized beyond salvation.

190
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,917
I warned Sam, but he didn't listen to me.

191
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,708
He's as stubborn as Steve Rogers before him.

192
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:28,542
But you…

193
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,958
They literally programmed you to kill.

194
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:36,292
James, do what needs to be done.

195
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,958
Karli has people everywhere,

196
00:18:39,042 --> 00:18:43,500
and there's only one way to make
sure she cannot continue her mission.

197
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,792
I appreciate the advice.

198
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,458
But we're gonna do it our own way.

199
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,125
Yeah.

200
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,750
I was afraid you would say that.

201
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,042
Ladies…

202
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:02,083
I took the liberty of
crossing off my name in your book.

203
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,958
I hold no grudges for what
you thought you had to do.

204
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:09,792
Goodbye, James.

205
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,292
We will take him to the Raft…

206
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:23,875
Where he will live out his days.

207
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:29,167
It would be prudent

208
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,125
to make yourself scarce in
Wakanda for the time being, White Wolf.

209
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:34,667
Fair enough.

210
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:41,833
Hey!

211
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:50,792
I may have another favor to ask of you.

212
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,292
Come on.

213
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,750
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What you doing, man? Where you goin'?

214
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,042
I'm goin' to see your grandfather.

215
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,542
All right, he in the back.

216
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,458
Thanks.

217
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:14,333
-I'll be back there.
-Yeah.

218
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:16,917
Check up, man.

219
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:20,583
Oh!

220
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,208
That what I think it is?

221
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,417
Mmm-mmm. Leave it covered.

222
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:53,958
Them stars and stripes
don't mean nothin' good to me.

223
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,917
I need to understand.

224
00:22:00,917 --> 00:22:02,625
You understand.

225
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,208
Every Black man does.

226
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,083
Whether you wanna deny it or not…

227
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:11,208
Don't do that bitter,
old man thing with me.

228
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:13,708
If you ain't bitter, you're blind.

229
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:18,875
I don't get it, okay?

230
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:23,500
What went wrong?

231
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:29,375
I used to be like you,

232
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:32,250
until I opened my eyes,

233
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:36,042
until I saw men in the Red Tails,

234
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:40,833
the famous 332 fight for this country,

235
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:44,958
only to come home to find
crosses burned on their lawn.

236
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:47,333
I'm from the south. I get that.

237
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:50,583
But you were a Super Soldier like Steve.
You could've been the next…

238
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:52,583
The next? What?

239
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:54,458
Huh?

240
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:59,208
Blonde hair, blue eyes, stars and stripes?

241
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:02,833
The entire world's been
chasing that great white hope

242
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:04,792
since he first got dosed with that serum.

243
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:07,583
Steve did not put you in jail.

244
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,333
She died while I was in jail.

245
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:30,458
They, uh, never let a single
one of her letters get to me.

246
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,250
They locked 'em in this box.

247
00:23:35,292 --> 00:23:36,583
They told her I was dead.

248
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:43,500
Yeah, and after a while,
she was gone, and, uh…

249
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:52,708
Sorry.

250
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:56,083
You wanted to know what went wrong?

251
00:23:57,583 --> 00:24:03,167
A handful of us got shot up with
different versions of that serum,

252
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,167
but they don't tell us what it is.

253
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:10,042
They tell us it's tetanus.

254
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:12,667
They sent us on missions,

255
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,000
even though the others weren't stable.

256
00:24:16,917 --> 00:24:20,042
Some of us started dying off.

257
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:24,333
Then a couple of the boys
get captured on a mission.

258
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:31,875
I heard the brass talkin'
about blowing the POW camp to hell

259
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:33,083
to hide the evidence.

260
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:37,167
But those were my men.
My brothers.

261
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,125
Not evidence.

262
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:45,250
So I bust out of the facility one night

263
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:47,417
and I brought them boys back.

264
00:24:48,042 --> 00:24:51,500
Not that it made a damn bit of difference.

265
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,292
It wasn't long before it was only me left.

266
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:59,333
And what did I get for saving their lives?

267
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:13,875
For the next 30 years,

268
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:17,917
they experimented on me,

269
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,917
trying to figure out why the serum worked.

270
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,250
There was a nurse.

271
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,583
She took pity on me.

272
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:34,792
Wrote up some fake reports, something.

273
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:37,708
She had me declared dead.

274
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,042
That's who gave me this.

275
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:57,708
My God!

276
00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:02,333
Sam, I loved her so much.

277
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,167
Mr. Bradley, um…

278
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:12,042
We gotta do something.
We gotta tell somebody.

279
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:16,000
No. Leave me dead. My name is buried.

280
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:19,083
But the world's different now.
I know people.

281
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:21,250
Man, that's why you're here?

282
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:25,958
You think things are different?
You think times are different?

283
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:30,167
You think I wouldn't be dead
in a day if you brought me out?

284
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:37,125
You wanna believe jail was my fault
because you got that white man's shield.

285
00:26:40,042 --> 00:26:43,000
They were worried my story might get out.

286
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:48,917
So, they erased me.

287
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:51,125
My history.

288
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:55,083
But they've been doing that for 500 years.

289
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:02,250
Pledge allegiance to that, my brother.

290
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:09,917
They will never let a
Black man be Captain America.

291
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:12,958
And even if they did,

292
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:19,333
no self-respecting Black
man would ever wanna be.

293
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:51,500
Sarah, I'm comin' home.

294
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,792
Good job, guys.

295
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:19,917
In about 10 years,
we'll have this thing fixed.

296
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:25,208
Would be fun to take the boat out
one more time, before we sell it?

297
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:27,958
There's a great spot in Grand Isle,

298
00:28:28,042 --> 00:28:30,625
your grandfather used to take me,
catch a lot of fish.

299
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:32,917
But Mom said we can't sell it.

300
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,375
What?

301
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:36,667
It's too messed up.

302
00:28:37,292 --> 00:28:40,625
Mr. Dinh said he wouldn't buy
it 'cause it cost more to fix.

303
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:44,250
And then he said
something else in Vietnamese.

304
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:45,917
Yeah.

305
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:50,292
<i>Why didn't you say somethin'?</i>

306
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:52,583
I didn't wanna tell you last night

307
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:55,292
when you were lookin' all
sad puppy dog in the rain.

308
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:57,500
It was a rough day.

309
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,208
You mean with Isaiah Bradley?

310
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:02,417
And what they did to him.

311
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
You wanna talk about it?

312
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:07,667
No.

313
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:10,625
I'm trying to figure out what it all means.

314
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,125
Okay, well, I'm here.

315
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,625
But as far as the boat is concerned,
bottom line is, Mr. Dinh backed out.

316
00:29:22,917 --> 00:29:24,125
I don't know what to do.

317
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:27,417
Parts alone on that thing are
gonna eat up most of what we get back.

318
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,250
Listen to me. Don't worry.
I'm gonna fix the boat.

319
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:32,875
Aren't you supposed to
be off saving the world?

320
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:34,458
Why are you back here bothering me?

321
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:37,542
'Cause my family's
well-being is a part of the world.

322
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:40,833
So you're waiting for a lead?

323
00:29:40,917 --> 00:29:46,125
And the government stepped in and
took control and kind of benched us.

324
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:50,417
Oh!

325
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,583
Hey, guys.

326
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,792
Please make sure Bennett
and Elling each get one.

327
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:56,917
-Okay?
-Okay.

328
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,917
-All right. Bye.
-Bye.

329
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,625
Have a good day at school, guys.

330
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:01,708
Okay.

331
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:06,958
Bennett and Elling's dad
cannot get up before noon.

332
00:30:07,042 --> 00:30:09,958
Kids keep showing up hungry,
but are too proud to ask for any help.

333
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:12,708
And you're like Mom,
feeding every kid in the neighborhood.

334
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,875
How many people still
owe Mom and Dad something?

335
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:18,958
All of them.

336
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:20,333
All that's left, for sure.

337
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:23,167
Hmm…

338
00:30:23,292 --> 00:30:25,917
It might be time to call
in a few of those favors.

339
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:30,750
I'm gonna fix this damn boat.

340
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,375
-<i>Hey, it's Sam Wilson.</i>
-<i>Hi, Sam.</i>

341
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,708
<i>Yeah. Paul's youngest
boy from up the street.</i>

342
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:38,875
<i>How's your sister?</i>

343
00:30:38,958 --> 00:30:41,208
<i>Hey, Miss Paddy.
You remember my mom and dad?</i>

344
00:30:41,292 --> 00:30:42,333
<i>Yes, I remember.</i>

345
00:30:42,417 --> 00:30:44,083
<i>Hey, Mr. Falcon.</i>

346
00:30:44,167 --> 00:30:45,583
<i>What's happenin' with you, boy?</i>

347
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:47,667
<i>I'm back in town,
that's why I'm calling.</i>

348
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,833
<i>What you need?</i>

349
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:49,917
-<i>Mr. Thurow.</i>
-<i>Yes.</i>

350
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,333
<i>Any chance I can ask a favor?</i>

351
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:53,208
<i>Anything for the Wilson family.</i>

352
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:55,708
-<i>Appreciate it.</i>
-<i>We'll be there if you need us.</i>

353
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:02,042
I don't know how we're gonna get it out.

354
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:03,625
We need some more guys for this.

355
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:05,667
Tommy, Carlos, man, this is amazing.

356
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:09,917
-Thanks so much, man.
-Look…

357
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,083
-Thank y'all.
-Hey, look,

358
00:31:11,167 --> 00:31:13,167
word goes out the Wilson family needs help?

359
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,250
Yes, sir.

360
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:16,042
We still got a bit of usefulness in us.

361
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,417
How do we get it off the truck?

362
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:25,417
Oh!

363
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,500
You're welcome.

364
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:33,000
Just dropping this off.

365
00:31:34,917 --> 00:31:36,583
You can sign for it and I'll go.

366
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:40,875
I called in a favor from the Wakandans.

367
00:31:45,292 --> 00:31:46,292
Sam!

368
00:31:53,958 --> 00:31:56,042
-Hi.
-Hi.

369
00:31:56,792 --> 00:32:00,083
Hold on, hold on.
You gotta go up.

370
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,917
Why didn't you use the metal arm?

371
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:15,833
Well…

372
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:18,375
I don't always think of it immediately.

373
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:19,625
I'm right-handed.

374
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:22,708
So, this is the boat, huh?

375
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:24,542
This is it.

376
00:32:26,542 --> 00:32:27,542
It's nice.

377
00:32:29,917 --> 00:32:30,917
You want any help?

378
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:34,625
Yeah.

379
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:40,958
I'm Bucky.

380
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:44,042
Ah. Sarah.

381
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:45,792
Sarah…

382
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:22,375
Shit!

383
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:37,083
Thanks.

384
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,208
Think Karli's gonna throw in the towel?

385
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,625
I think she's gonna double down.

386
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:48,708
Any idea how to stop her?

387
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:51,042
I got Joaquin working on something.

388
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:53,542
Well, Zemo says there's only one way.

389
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:08,750
Well…

390
00:34:10,917 --> 00:34:12,542
Gotta catch my flight tomorrow.

391
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:16,750
Get a hotel room for the night.

392
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,500
Crash, you know?

393
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:20,250
You're just gonna set me up like that, huh?

394
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:23,583
I don't wanna make it weird for your family.

395
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:25,208
Just stay here.

396
00:34:25,292 --> 00:34:26,292
The people in this town

397
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:28,583
are the most welcoming people in the world.

398
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:31,167
They don't care if you wear small T-shirts

399
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,958
or if you have six toes
or if your mom's your aunt.

400
00:34:34,042 --> 00:34:35,417
Okay, I get it.

401
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,708
I mean, you know, the people are nice.

402
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:40,625
But don't flirt with my sister.

403
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:42,500
-No.
-'Cause if you do,

404
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:44,500
I'll have Carlos cut you up,
feed you to fish.

405
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:45,583
Okay.

406
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:57,083
And then what?

407
00:34:58,042 --> 00:34:59,625
After I saw what happened

408
00:35:00,542 --> 00:35:01,542
to Lemar,

409
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I went after him.

410
00:35:06,042 --> 00:35:08,875
And, um, that guy…

411
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:12,000
He's the one that killed our boy?

412
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:13,583
Yes.

413
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:16,875
I would never let the
person who did that get away.

414
00:35:18,042 --> 00:35:20,750
And I hope you can find
some measure of peace in that.

415
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,750
I took that.

416
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:37,458
When we got back from our first tour.

417
00:35:41,292 --> 00:35:42,750
There was nobody like him.

418
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:44,958
Lemar knew the risk.

419
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:48,667
After everything you boys
have been through together,

420
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:52,542
I know he's restin' easier

421
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:54,958
knowin' that the man who's responsible

422
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:57,833
got his justice.

423
00:35:59,542 --> 00:36:02,125
He was so proud of you

424
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:05,375
when they made you Captain America.

425
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:09,125
And he would tell me every day,

426
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:12,917
what an honor it was to be your partner.

427
00:36:14,708 --> 00:36:16,042
It meant the world to him.

428
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:23,792
And for me too.

429
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:35,458
I'm sorry.

430
00:36:38,292 --> 00:36:41,167
If you ever need me,
I'm always here for you.

431
00:36:43,292 --> 00:36:44,458
Okay.

432
00:37:16,542 --> 00:37:18,125
I have a job for you.

433
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:22,792
Please. If it weren't for me,
you'd be rotting in that Algerian prison.

434
00:37:28,917 --> 00:37:30,083
Finished?

435
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:34,583
I can give you double this time.

436
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:37,583
I promise you won't regret saying yes.

437
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:39,333
So what's it gonna be?

438
00:37:53,542 --> 00:37:55,000
Hey!

439
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:56,500
Put it back.

440
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:58,208
Hurry, hurry!

441
00:38:51,917 --> 00:38:52,917
Push the stopper.

442
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:55,667
Oh, in there.

443
00:39:02,792 --> 00:39:04,875
-Thanks.
-Yep.

444
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:11,208
Hey. Start loosening those bolts.

445
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:12,583
Got it.

446
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,500
Okay, so…

447
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:23,792
Excuse me. No!

448
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:26,958
There should be a three-sixteenths
bolt that goes in the big gear.

449
00:39:27,042 --> 00:39:28,542
-Nope.
-Uh-huh. No. No.

450
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:30,417
-You didn't even look.
-I didn't have to.

451
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:34,042
Hi, Sarah.

452
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:36,000
I told you specifically that the water pump

453
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:37,917
was not the problem,
and yet, here you are.

454
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,167
Yep, Samuel.

455
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,542
In our defense,

456
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:42,958
we were supposed to be
done long before you woke up.

457
00:39:43,042 --> 00:39:44,292
I don't come up to the sky

458
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:46,917
to tell you how to barrel roll,
so don't come down here

459
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,083
and mess around with
things you don't understand.

460
00:39:49,167 --> 00:39:51,958
-Wow. Wow.
-Bye. Off.

461
00:39:52,042 --> 00:39:53,042
Thank you, gentlemen.

462
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:54,542
Appreciate you.

463
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:55,625
I love you, bro.

464
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,167
She's a very mean person.

465
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:02,292
It's tough love.

466
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:04,125
No. If you did what I told you to do,

467
00:40:04,208 --> 00:40:06,458
we would have been done
before any of this took place.

468
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:08,292
There is no such thing.

469
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:11,000
There's a prowess that goes into my madness.

470
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:26,292
Feels weird…

471
00:40:27,417 --> 00:40:28,458
Picking it up again.

472
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:34,625
The legacy of that shield

473
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,958
is complicated, to say the least.

474
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:43,458
When Steve told me what he was planning,
I don't think we understood

475
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:46,500
what it felt like for a
Black man to be handed the shield.

476
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,500
How could we?

477
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:51,625
I owe you an apology.

478
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:55,792
I'm sorry.

479
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:58,875
Thank you.

480
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:05,708
Whatever happened with Walker,
it wasn't your fault.

481
00:41:07,542 --> 00:41:08,542
I get it.

482
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:10,750
It's just, that shield's

483
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:14,375
the closest thing I've got left to a family,

484
00:41:16,167 --> 00:41:17,542
so when you retired it,

485
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:21,500
it made me feel like I had nothing left.

486
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:24,292
Made me question everything.

487
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,042
You, Steve, me.

488
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:31,125
You know, I've got his, uh…

489
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:32,917
I've got his book.

490
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And, uh…

491
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:38,208
I just figured if it worked for him,

492
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:39,958
then it'd work for me.

493
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:45,417
I understand, man.

494
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,125
But Steve is gone.

495
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:54,042
And this might be a surprise,

496
00:41:56,125 --> 00:41:58,208
but it doesn't matter what Steve thought.

497
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:06,083
You gotta stop looking to other
people to tell you who you are.

498
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:11,833
Let me ask you.

499
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,458
You still having those nightmares?

500
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,667
All the time.

501
00:42:17,292 --> 00:42:18,917
It means I remember.

502
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,875
It means a part of me is still there.

503
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,000
Which means a part of the
Winter Soldier's still in me.

504
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:31,042
You up for a little tough love?

505
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:35,083
You want to climb out of the hell you're in,

506
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:37,083
do the work.

507
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:39,208
Do it.

508
00:42:40,417 --> 00:42:41,625
I've been making amends.

509
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:44,333
Nah. You weren't amending,
you were avenging.

510
00:42:44,417 --> 00:42:48,042
You were stopping all the wrongdoers
you enabled as the Winter Soldier,

511
00:42:48,708 --> 00:42:50,833
because you thought it
would bring you closure.

512
00:42:54,542 --> 00:42:56,792
You go to these people and say "sorry,"

513
00:42:57,792 --> 00:43:00,500
because you think it'll
make you feel better, right?

514
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:04,167
But you gotta make them feel better.

515
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,583
You gotta go to them and be of service.

516
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:10,833
I'm sure there's at
least one person in that book

517
00:43:10,917 --> 00:43:12,458
who needs closure about something,

518
00:43:12,542 --> 00:43:15,708
and you're the only one
who can give it to 'em.

519
00:43:15,792 --> 00:43:17,500
Probably a dozen.

520
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:18,625
That's cool.

521
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:20,375
Start with one.

522
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:26,583
Good talk.

523
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,542
-You know Karli won't quit.
-Ah.

524
00:43:33,625 --> 00:43:36,208
You call me when you have a lead,
and I'll be there.

525
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:40,708
Not necessarily as a team.

526
00:43:40,792 --> 00:43:41,792
Nope.

527
00:43:41,875 --> 00:43:43,542
-We're not that good.
-Definitely not.

528
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:45,208
-We're professionals.
-Definitely.

529
00:43:45,292 --> 00:43:48,458
-And, uh, we're partners.
-Co-workers.

530
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:51,292
But we're also a couple
of guys with a mutual friend.

531
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:53,458
-Friend's now gone.
-So we're a couple of guys.

532
00:43:53,542 --> 00:43:54,875
-I can live with that.
-Perfect.

533
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:58,500
Thanks for the help, man.

534
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:00,250
Meant a lot.

535
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:01,333
Of course.

536
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:41,167
There's only one last thing to do.

537
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:42,625
Looks good.

538
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:49,667
Stop. Don't.

539
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,583
We can't sell it.

540
00:44:57,167 --> 00:44:59,708
I know. I know the speech.
It's not smart, but…

541
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:03,083
I just can't.

542
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:08,292
Sarah, I'm so happy to hear you say that.

543
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:11,500
We have to preserve this.

544
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:16,750
If there's one thing I've learned,
it's that I can't win every fight.

545
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:19,292
That's cool.
I'm okay with that. But this…

546
00:45:21,083 --> 00:45:22,125
This is our history.

547
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:24,917
We can't lose this fight.

548
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:30,917
All our struggles as a people,
I think about it and I used to say,

549
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,708
"I'mma show them.
I'mma go out and change the world."

550
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:37,042
Yeah, silly, I know,

551
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:39,917
but when I'd look in your eyes,

552
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,208
I could tell you were always
thinking that I was runnin' away.

553
00:45:48,417 --> 00:45:49,417
Sam, listen to me.

554
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:53,750
At no point in my life did I
ever think you were runnin' away.

555
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:55,625
From anything.

556
00:45:55,708 --> 00:45:59,125
Not even when I was
lightin' yo ass up at the bank.

557
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:03,750
Who knew you were so sensitive.

558
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:07,917
God, I missed you so much.

559
00:46:14,167 --> 00:46:17,125
There's a fight out there,
and then, there's our fight here,

560
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:19,250
and, bro, you have taken them both on.

561
00:46:23,708 --> 00:46:26,125
So you really gonna let
Isaiah Bradley get in your head?

562
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,208
You gonna let him decide what you do next?

563
00:46:29,292 --> 00:46:31,292
Isaiah has been to hell and back.

564
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:34,250
If I was in his shoes,
I'd feel the exact same way.

565
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:39,583
But what would be the point
of all the pain and sacrifice

566
00:46:40,875 --> 00:46:43,333
if I wasn't willing to
stand up and keep fightin'?

567
00:47:27,292 --> 00:47:28,292
All day, baby.

568
00:47:28,375 --> 00:47:29,917
-Uncle Sam!
-Uncle Sam!

569
00:47:31,208 --> 00:47:32,208
Get him, AJ!

570
00:48:36,417 --> 00:48:37,625
What are we doin' here?

571
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:40,458
I got some help to even out the odds.

572
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:44,417
Sam screwed him out of a
small fortune not long ago.

573
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,625
He's been dying to get payback ever since.

574
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:00,625
Come on.

575
00:49:00,708 --> 00:49:02,958
So we're working with criminals now?

576
00:49:03,042 --> 00:49:04,042
Haven't you heard?

577
00:49:04,792 --> 00:49:05,792
We are criminals.

578
00:49:06,667 --> 00:49:08,833
Georges gets his payback and we get a killer.

579
00:49:08,917 --> 00:49:10,375
It's a bargain on both sides.

580
00:49:11,792 --> 00:49:14,000
You invite me here for a picnic or what?

581
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,042
We're gonna make sure
the GRC vote never happens.

582
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:33,250
Hey.

583
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:37,292
I'm only here to kill the Falcon.

584
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:38,500
You'll get your chance.

585
00:49:48,042 --> 00:49:49,333
Tonight, we go to battle.

586
00:49:51,083 --> 00:49:52,125
All of us.

587
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:07,458
<i>In New York, where the GRC is
voting on the controversial Patch Act,</i>

588
00:50:07,542 --> 00:50:10,042
<i>which would move upwards
of twenty million refugees</i>

589
00:50:10,125 --> 00:50:12,500
<i>back home to their countries of origin.</i>

590
00:50:12,583 --> 00:50:15,167
<i>It's coming during these difficult
times of international politics.</i>

591
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:18,750
<i>Sorry this took so long.
Spare you the technical details,</i>

592
00:50:18,833 --> 00:50:21,250
<i>but I finally got results
for the scans you asked for,</i>

593
00:50:21,333 --> 00:50:22,958
<i>and I think we're onto something.</i>

594
00:50:23,042 --> 00:50:24,625
<i>When we look back, all these pings,</i>

595
00:50:24,708 --> 00:50:27,000
<i>they're from places just
before the Flag Smashers hit,</i>

596
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:28,667
<i>clearly, they're all over Europe.</i>

597
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:31,792
<i>Earlier today, we got one from New York.</i>

598
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:35,000
<i>Now, I can't promise
you they're not using a VPN</i>

599
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:36,708
<i>or masking their location, but…</i>

600
00:50:36,792 --> 00:50:37,875
Great work, Joaquin.

601
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:40,625
I'll take it from here.

602
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,542
<i>Look, the right people
will go along with this,</i>

603
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:48,625
<i>they always do…</i>

604
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:50,542
<i>You have to consider the optics.</i>

605
00:50:50,625 --> 00:50:52,458
<i>No, the optics are whatever we show them.</i>

606
00:50:52,542 --> 00:50:55,292
<i>People have to believe in
what we're doing to support us.</i>

607
00:50:55,375 --> 00:50:58,292
<i>Do we really need to bother with a vote?</i>

608
00:50:59,625 --> 00:51:02,125
<i>There are troops in place.</i>

609
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:06,708
<i>I can make a call and
have the refugees move now.</i>

610
00:51:06,792 --> 00:51:08,875
<i>We're not rounding them up like cattle.</i>

611
00:51:08,958 --> 00:51:11,750
<i>And we still do not have sufficient resources</i>

612
00:51:11,833 --> 00:51:14,167
<i>in the resettlement camps.</i>

613
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:15,792
<i>What's sufficient?</i>

614
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:17,792
<i>They can't stay where they are forever.</i>

615
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:19,250
-One world.
-One people.
