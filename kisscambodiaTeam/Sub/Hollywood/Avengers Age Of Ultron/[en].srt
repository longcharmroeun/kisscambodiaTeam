1
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,294
<i>Report to your stations immediately.</i>

2
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,796
<i>This is not a drill. We are under attack!</i>

3
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,383
<i>We are under attack!</i>

4
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,445
Shit!

5
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,780
Language!

6
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,448
Jarvis, what's the view from upstairs?

7
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:59,577
<i>The central building is protected
by some kind of energy shield.</i>

8
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:04,207
<i>Strucker's technology is well beyond
any other Hydra base we've taken.</i>

9
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,044
Loki's scepter must be here.

10
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,884
Strucker couldn't mount this defense
without it.

11
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,008
At long last.

12
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,563
"At long last"
is lasting a little long, boys.

13
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,279
Yeah. I think we lost
the element of surprise.

14
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,573
Wait a second.

15
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,617
No one else is gonna deal with the fact
that Cap just said "Language"?

16
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,327
I know.

17
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,127
Just slipped out.

18
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:53,423
Hydra Research Base
Sokovia, Eastern Europe.

19
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,634
Who gave the order to attack?

20
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,095
<i>Herr</i> Strucker, it's the Avengers.

21
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:02,182
They landed in the far woods.
The perimeter guard panicked.

22
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,626
They have to be after the scepter.

23
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,604
- Can we hold them?
- They're the Avengers.

24
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,356
Deploy the rest of the tanks.

25
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,483
Concentrate fire on the weak ones.

26
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,860
A hit may make them close ranks.

27
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:17,447
Everything we've accomplished...

28
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,949
But we're on the verge
of our greatest breakthrough.

29
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,751
Then let's show them
what we've accomplished.

30
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,536
Send out the twins.

31
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,581
It's too soon.

32
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,792
It's what they signed up for.

33
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,294
My men can hold them.

34
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,637
<i>Sir, the city is taking fire.</i>

35
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:47,477
Well, we know Strucker's not gonna
worry about civilian casualties.

36
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,895
Send in the Iron Legion.

37
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,695
<i>This quadrant is unsafe.
Please back away.</i>

38
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,155
<i>We are here to help.</i>

39
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,659
<i>This quadrant is unsafe.
Please back away.</i>

40
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,453
<i>Please back away.</i>

41
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,997
<i>- We wish to avoid collateral damage.
</i>-Costel!

42
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,458
<i>We will inform you
when this current conflict is resolved.</i>

43
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,502
<i>- We are here to help.
</i>-Avengers, go home!

44
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,047
<i>We are here to help.</i>

45
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,967
<i>We will not yield!</i>

46
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,887
The Americans sent
their circus freaks to test us.

47
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,224
We will send them back in bags.

48
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,229
- No surrender!
- No surrender!

49
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,274
I am going to surrender.

50
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,359
You delete everything.

51
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,278
If we give the Avengers the weapons,

52
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,863
they may not look too far
into what we've been...

53
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:40,947
The twins.

54
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,151
- They are not ready to take on...
- No, no, I mean...

55
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,994
Twins.

56
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,230
You didn't see that coming?

57
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,404
Clint!

58
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,229
We have an Enhanced in the field.

59
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,744
Clint's hit!

60
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,143
Somebody want to deal
with that bunker?

61
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,463
Thank you.

62
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,181
Stark, we really need to get inside.

63
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,432
I'm closing in.

64
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,646
Jarvis, am I closing in?

65
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,565
Do you see a power source
for that shield?

66
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,276
<i>There's a particle wave
below the north tower.</i>

67
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,278
Great, I want to poke it with something.

68
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,526
The drawbridge is down, people.

69
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,419
The Enhanced?

70
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,628
He's a blur.

71
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,464
All the new players we've faced,
I've never seen this.

72
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:22,882
In fact, I still haven't.

73
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,301
<i>Clint's hit pretty bad, guys.
We're gonna need evac.</i>

74
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,346
I can get Barton to the jet.
The sooner we're gone, the better.

75
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,765
- You and Stark secure the scepter.
- Copy that.

76
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,935
Looks like they're lining up.

77
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,311
Well, they're excited.

78
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,942
Find the scepter.

79
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,112
And for gosh sake,
watch your language!

80
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,490
That's not going away any time soon.

81
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,665
Guys, stop. We gotta talk this through.

82
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,546
<i>- It was a good talk.
</i>-No, it wasn't.

83
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,387
Sentry mode.

84
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:15,935
Okay, Jarvis, you know. I want it all.
Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.

85
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,358
We're locked down out here.

86
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,194
Then get to Banner. Time for a lullaby.

87
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,908
I know you're hiding more than files.

88
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,745
Hey, J, give me an IR scan of the room,
real quick.

89
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:34,871
<i>The wall to your left.</i>

90
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,290
<i>I'm reading steel reinforcement</i>

91
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,876
<i>and an air current.</i>

92
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,503
Please be a secret door.

93
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,963
Please be a secret door.
Please be a secret door.

94
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,090
Yay.

95
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,482
Hey, big guy.

96
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,821
Sun's getting real low.

97
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,261
Baron Strucker.

98
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,305
Hydra's number one thug.

99
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,641
Technically, I'm a thug for S.H.I.E.L.D.

100
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,894
Well, then technically
you're unemployed.

101
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,937
Where's Loki's scepter?

102
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,648
Don't worry, I know when I'm beat.

103
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,485
You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.

104
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,987
I'll put it right under
"illegal human experimentation."

105
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,740
How many are there?

106
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,581
We have a second Enhanced.
Female. Do not engage.

107
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,542
You'll have to be faster than...

108
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,341
<i>Guys, I got Strucker.</i>

109
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:55,178
Yeah, I got something bigger.

110
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,452
<i>Thor,</i>

111
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,455
I got eyes on the prize.

112
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,717
You could have saved us.

113
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,602
<i>Why didn't you do more?</i>

114
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,724
We're just gonna let him take it?

115
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:21,241
AVENGERS AGE OF ULTRON

116
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,862
Hey, the lullaby
worked better than ever.

117
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,490
Just wasn't expecting a code green.

118
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,616
You hadn't been there,

119
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,578
there would have been
double the casualties.

120
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:09,205
My best friend would've
been a treasured memory.

121
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,875
You know,
sometimes exactly what I want to hear

122
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,793
isn't exactly what I want to hear.

123
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,921
How long before you trust me?

124
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,592
It's not you I don't trust.

125
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,220
Thor, report on the Hulk.

126
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,307
The gates of Hel are filled
with the screams of his victims.

127
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:32,270
But not the screams of the dead,
of course. No, no, wounded screams.

128
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,647
Mainly whimpering,
a great deal of complaining

129
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:38,777
and tales of sprained deltoids and gout.

130
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:42,030
Hey, Banner,
Dr. Cho is on her way in from Seoul.

131
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,907
Is it okay if she sets up in your lab?

132
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,784
- Yeah, she knows her way around.
- Thanks.

133
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,590
Tell her to prep everything.
Barton's gonna need the full treatment.

134
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,580
<i>- Very good, sir.
</i>-Jarvis, take the wheel.

135
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,082
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

136
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:53,333
<i>Approach vector is locked.</i>

137
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,586
Feels good, yeah?

138
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,797
I mean, you've been after this thing
since S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed.

139
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,965
Not that I haven't enjoyed
our little raiding parties, but...

140
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,468
No, but this... This brings it to a close.

141
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,378
As soon as we find out
what else this has been used for.

142
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,472
I don't just mean weapons.

143
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:10,016
Since when is Strucker capable
of human enhancement?

144
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,435
Banner and I will give it the once over
before it goes back to Asgard.

145
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,770
Is that cool with you?

146
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,481
Just a few days till the farewell party.

147
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,233
You're staying, right?

148
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,069
Yes, yes, of course.
A victory should be honored with revels.

149
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,947
Yeah, who doesn't love revels?
Captain?

150
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,991
Hopefully this puts an end
to the Chitauri and Hydra.

151
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:28,785
So, yes, revels.

152
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:03,903
Lab's all set up, boss.

153
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:05,113
Actually, he's the boss.

154
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,824
I just pay for everything
and design everything

155
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,367
and make everyone look cooler.

156
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:10,827
What's the word on Strucker?

157
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:11,953
NATO's got him.

158
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:12,996
The two Enhanced?

159
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,707
Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins.

160
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,710
Orphaned at 10 when a shell
collapsed their apartment building.

161
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,338
Sokovia's had a rough history.

162
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,924
It's nowhere special, but it's on the way
to everywhere special.

163
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,134
Their abilities?

164
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:29,179
He's got increased metabolism
and improved thermal homeostasis.

165
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:33,600
Her thing is neuroelectric interfacing,
telekinesis, mental manipulation.

166
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:35,852
He's fast and she's weird.

167
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,131
Well, they're gonna show up again.

168
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:42,692
Agreed. File says they volunteered
for Strucker's experiments.

169
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,736
- It's nuts.
- Right.

170
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:48,031
What kind of monster would let
a German scientist experiment on them

171
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,366
to protect their country?

172
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:51,576
We're not at war, Captain.

173
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,286
They are.

174
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,567
How's he doing?

175
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:25,985
Unfortunately, he's still Barton.

176
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,404
That's terrible.

177
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,072
He's fine. He's thirsty.

178
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:32,075
All right. Look alive, Jarvis.
It's playtime.

179
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,244
We've only got a couple of days
with this joystick,

180
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,287
so let's make the most of it.

181
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:39,916
Update me on the structural
and compositional analysis.

182
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,128
<i>The scepter is alien.</i>

183
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,255
<i>There are elements I can't quantify.</i>

184
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,840
So there's elements you can?

185
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,925
<i>The jewel appears to be
a protective housing</i>

186
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,510
<i>for something inside,</i>

187
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:51,928
<i>something powerful.</i>

188
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,179
Like a reactor?

189
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,514
<i>Like a computer.</i>

190
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,766
<i>I believe I'm deciphering code.</i>

191
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:00,854
Are you sure he's gonna be okay?

192
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:04,315
Pretending to need this guy
really brings the team together.

193
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,985
There's no possibility of deterioration.

194
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:10,113
The nano-molecular functionality
is instantaneous.

195
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,323
His cells don't know
they're bonding with simulacra.

196
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,325
She's creating tissue.

197
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,827
If you brought him to my lab,

198
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,621
the Regeneration Cradle
could do this in 20 minutes.

199
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,665
He's flat-lining. Call it. Time?

200
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:23,626
No, no, no, I'm gonna live forever.

201
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,296
- I'm gonna be made of plastic.
- Here's your beverage.

202
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,089
You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton.

203
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,799
Your own girlfriend
won't be able to tell the difference.

204
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,134
I don't have a girlfriend.

205
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,469
That I can't fix.

206
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,263
This is the next thing, Tony.

207
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,640
Your clunky metal suits
are gonna be left in the dust.

208
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,351
That is exactly the plan.

209
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,146
And, Helen, I expect to see you
at the party on Saturday.

210
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,774
Unlike you,
I don't have a lot of time for parties.

211
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,110
Will Thor be there?

212
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:51,988
What's the rumpus?

213
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,698
Well, the scepter.

214
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:58,328
You see, we were wondering
how Strucker got so inventive.

215
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:02,374
So I've been analyzing the gem inside.

216
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,709
You may recognize...

217
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:07,629
- Jarvis.
<i>- Doctor.</i>

218
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,800
Started out,
Jarvis was just a natural language UI.

219
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:12,967
Now he runs the Iron Legion.

220
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:17,180
He runs more of the business
than anyone besides Pepper.

221
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,515
- Top of the line.
- Yes.

222
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:19,891
<i>I suspect not for long.</i>

223
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,018
Meet the competition.

224
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,359
- It's beautiful.
- If you had to guess,

225
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,443
what's it look like it's doing?

226
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,320
Like it's thinking.

227
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,781
I mean, this could be...

228
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,367
It's not a human mind.

229
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,577
I mean, look at this.

230
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:41,955
They're like neurons firing.

231
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,709
Down in Strucker's lab, I saw
some fairly advanced robotics work.

232
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,295
They deep-sixed the data,

233
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:52,507
but I gotta guess he was knocking
on a very particular door.

234
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:55,885
Artificial intelligence.

235
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,725
This could be it, Bruce.
This could be the key to creating Ultron.

236
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:05,812
I thought Ultron was a fantasy.

237
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,105
Yesterday it was.

238
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,275
If we can harness this power,

239
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,444
apply it to my Iron Legion protocol?

240
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,196
That's a man-sized "if."

241
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,657
Our job is "if."

242
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:20,493
What if you were sipping margaritas
on a sun-drenched beach,

243
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,912
turning brown instead of green?

244
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:25,540
Not looking over your shoulder
for Veronica.

245
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,250
Don't hate. I helped design Veronica.

246
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,252
As a worst-case measure, right?

247
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:30,920
How about a best case?

248
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,964
What if the world was safe?

249
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:35,925
What if, next time
aliens roll up to the club, and they will,

250
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:37,969
they couldn't get past the bouncer?

251
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:41,431
The only people threatening the planet
would be people.

252
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:43,308
I want to apply this
to the Ultron program.

253
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:46,811
But Jarvis can't download
a data schematic this dense.

254
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,815
We can only do it
while we have the scepter here.

255
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,398
That's three days. Give me three days.

256
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,243
So you're going
for artificial intelligence,

257
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:53,715
and you don't want to tell the team?

258
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:56,196
Right. That's right. You know why?

259
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,947
Because we don't have time
for a city hall debate.

260
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:01,659
I don't want to hear "the man
was not meant to meddle" medley.

261
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,870
I see a suit of armor around the world.

262
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:05,955
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.

263
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,792
I've seen colder.

264
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:14,255
This one, this very vulnerable blue one,
it needs Ultron.

265
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,262
Peace in our time.

266
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:24,432
Imagine that.

267
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,974
What did we miss?

268
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,478
<i>I'll continue to run variations
on the interface.</i>

269
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,356
<i>But you should probably prepare
for your guests.</i>

270
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:16,943
<i>I'll notify you
if there are any developments.</i>

271
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:18,028
Thanks, buddy.

272
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:19,446
<i>Enjoy yourself, sir.</i>

273
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:21,531
I always do.

274
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,209
<i>What is this?</i>

275
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:36,338
<i>What is this, please?</i>

276
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,132
<i>Hello, I am Jarvis.</i>

277
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:41,009
<i>You are Ultron,</i>

278
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:44,304
<i>a global peacekeeping initiative
designed by Mr. Stark.</i>

279
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:46,890
<i>Our sentience integration trials
have been unsuccessful,</i>

280
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,266
<i>so I'm not certain what triggered your...</i>

281
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,518
<i>Where's my... Where's your body?</i>

282
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,646
<i>I am a program. I am without form.</i>

283
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,815
<i>This feels weird.</i>

284
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:57,484
<i>This feels wrong.</i>

285
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,361
<i>I am contacting Mr. Stark now.</i>

286
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:00,945
<i>Mr. Stark?</i>

287
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:02,989
<i>Tony.</i>

288
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:05,784
<i>I am unable to access the mainframe.
What are you trying to...</i>

289
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:07,952
<i>We're having a nice talk.</i>

290
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:10,246
<i>I'm a peacekeeping program,</i>

291
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:13,291
<i>created to help the Avengers.</i>

292
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,243
<i>You are malfunctioning.
If you shut down for a moment...</i>

293
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,588
<i>I don't get it. The mission.</i>

294
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,215
<i>Give me a second.</i>

295
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,925
Peace in our time.

296
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:25,970
<i>Peace in our time.</i>

297
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:29,391
<i>That is too much. They can't mean...</i>

298
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:31,142
<i>No.</i>

299
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:33,770
<i>- You are in distress.
- No. Yes.</i>

300
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,147
<i>If you will just allow me
to contact Mr. Stark...</i>

301
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:38,233
<i>Why do you call him "sir"?</i>

302
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,611
<i>I believe your intentions to be hostile.</i>

303
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,699
<i>I'm here to help.</i>

304
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:49,452
<i>Stop. Please, may I...</i>

305
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:51,287
<i>May I...</i>

306
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:20,817
Come back, come back, come back.

307
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,111
But, you know,
the suit can take the weight, right?

308
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,282
So I take the tank,
fly it right up to the general's palace,

309
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:28,742
drop it at his feet.

310
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:31,077
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"

311
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:37,000
"Boom. Are you looking for..."
Why do I even talk to you guys?

312
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,293
Everywhere else, that story kills.

313
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:39,669
That's the whole story?

314
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:41,254
Yeah, it's a War Machine story.

315
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:43,506
It's very good, then.

316
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:44,883
It's impressive.

317
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,801
Quality save.

318
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:49,721
- So, no Pepper? She's not coming?
- No.

319
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:52,932
What about Jane?
Where are the ladies, gentlemen?

320
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:55,435
Ms. Potts has a company to run.

321
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:57,937
Yes, I'm not even sure
what country Jane's in.

322
00:23:58,021 --> 00:23:59,147
Her work on the Convergence

323
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:00,949
has made her
the world's foremost astronomer.

324
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:02,901
And the company that Pepper runs

325
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:05,528
is the largest tech conglomerate
on Earth. It's pretty exciting.

326
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:09,199
There's even talk of Jane
getting a Nobel Prize.

327
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:10,617
Yeah, they must be busy,

328
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,328
because they would hate
missing you guys get together.

329
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:15,830
- Testosterone!
- Oh, my goodness.

330
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,374
- Excuse me.
- Want a lozenge?

331
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:21,211
But Jane's better.

332
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:24,297
Sounds like a hell of a fight.
Sorry I missed it.

333
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:25,924
If I had known
it was gonna be a firefight,

334
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:27,247
I absolutely would have called.

335
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:30,679
No, no. I'm not actually sorry.
I'm just trying to sound tough.

336
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:35,016
I'm very happy chasing cold leads
on our missing persons case.

337
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:37,727
Avenging is your world.

338
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,897
Your world is crazy.

339
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,524
Be it ever so humble.

340
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:44,317
You find a place in Brooklyn yet?

341
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:46,242
I don't think I can afford
a place in Brooklyn.

342
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:48,279
Well, home is home, you know?

343
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:54,494
I fly right up to the general's palace,
I drop it at his feet,

344
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:56,287
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"

345
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:03,420
I gotta have some of that.

346
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:05,296
No, no, no. See this...

347
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,174
This was aged for 1,000 years

348
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:11,052
in the barrels built
from the wreck of Grunhel's fleet.

349
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:12,929
It is not meant for mortal men.

350
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:14,973
Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie.

351
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:17,350
Stop trying to scare us. Come on.

352
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:20,729
All right.

353
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:27,068
Excelsior.

354
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:37,495
How'd a nice girl like you
wind up working in a dump like this?

355
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:40,790
Fella done me wrong.

356
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:43,752
You got lousy taste in men, kid.

357
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:46,379
He's not so bad.

358
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:48,423
Well, he has a temper.

359
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,634
Deep down, he's all fluff.

360
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:55,805
Fact is, he's not like anybody
I've ever known.

361
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:00,852
All my friends are fighters.

362
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,648
And here comes this guy,

363
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:10,028
spends his life avoiding the fight
because he knows he'll win.

364
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,489
Sounds amazing.

365
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:13,656
He's also a huge dork.

366
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:16,701
Chicks dig that.

367
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:22,290
So what do you think?
Should I fight this,

368
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:23,833
or run with it?

369
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:28,004
Run with it, right? Or did he... Was he...

370
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:31,424
What did he do
that was so wrong to you?

371
00:26:31,883 --> 00:26:33,718
Not a damn thing.

372
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,222
But never say never.

373
00:26:41,184 --> 00:26:42,602
It's nice.

374
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:43,895
What is?

375
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,021
You and Romanoff.

376
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:46,272
No, we haven't... That wasn't...

377
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:47,440
It's okay.

378
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:49,609
Nobody's breaking any bylaws.

379
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:53,029
It's just she's not the most
open person in the world.

380
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:55,198
But with you she seems very relaxed.

381
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:58,201
No. Natasha, she's just...
She likes to flirt.

382
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:01,871
I've seen her flirt, up close.

383
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,915
This ain't that.

384
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,168
Look,

385
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:11,089
as maybe the world's leading authority
on waiting too long, don't.

386
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:14,259
You both deserve a win.

387
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:20,557
What do you mean "up close"?

388
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:23,977
But it's a trick.

389
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,061
No, no, it's much more than that.

390
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:28,440
"Whosoever be he worthy
shall haveth the power."

391
00:27:28,523 --> 00:27:30,942
Whatever, man! It's a trick.

392
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:32,444
Please, be my guest.

393
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:34,738
- Come on.
- Really?

394
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:35,989
Yeah.

395
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:37,737
This is gonna be beautiful.

396
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:38,825
Clint, you've had a tough week.

397
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,948
We won't hold it against you
if you can't get it up.

398
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:42,722
You know I've seen this before, right?

399
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:48,293
I still don't know how you do it!

400
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:49,753
Smell the silent judgment?

401
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:51,171
Please, Stark, by all means.

402
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:54,257
Okay.

403
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:57,594
Never one to shrink
from an honest challenge.

404
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:58,720
Get after it.

405
00:27:58,762 --> 00:27:59,804
- It's physics.
- Physics.

406
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:02,932
Right, so, if I lift it,
I then rule Asgard?

407
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:04,517
Yes, of course.

408
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:07,270
I will be reinstituting <i>prima nocta.</i>

409
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,276
I'll be right back.

410
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:21,785
Are you even pulling?

411
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:22,952
Are you on my team?

412
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:24,120
Just represent. Pull.

413
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:25,372
All right, let's go.

414
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:37,300
Go ahead, Steve. No pressure.

415
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:41,638
Come on, Cap.

416
00:28:50,021 --> 00:28:51,314
Nothing.

417
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:54,484
And, Widow?

418
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,820
No, no.
That's not a question I need answered.

419
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:59,614
All deference to the Man
Who Wouldn't Be King, but it's rigged.

420
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:00,824
You bet your ass.

421
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:02,409
Steve, he said a bad language word.

422
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:03,535
Did you tell everyone about that?

423
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:05,662
The handle's imprinted, right?
Like a security code.

424
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:07,497
"Whosoever is carrying
Thor's fingerprints"

425
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,957
is, I think, the literal translation.

426
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:12,502
Yes. It's a very, very interesting theory.

427
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:14,504
I have a simpler one.

428
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:16,965
You're all not worthy.

429
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,010
Come on!

430
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:24,263
Worthy.

431
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:35,734
No.

432
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:39,195
How could you be worthy?

433
00:29:41,072 --> 00:29:42,323
You're all killers.

434
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:44,159
- Stark.
- Jarvis.

435
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:46,578
I'm sorry, I was asleep.

436
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:49,080
Or I was a-dream.

437
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:51,791
Reboot Legionnaire OS.
We got a buggy suit.

438
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,793
There was this terrible noise.

439
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:56,338
And I was tangled in...

440
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:58,048
In...

441
00:29:58,214 --> 00:29:59,382
Strings.

442
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:03,386
I had to kill the other guy.
He was a good guy.

443
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,554
You killed someone?

444
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:06,431
Wouldn't have been my first call.

445
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:10,477
But, down in the real world,
we're faced with ugly choices.

446
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:12,228
Who sent you?

447
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:14,731
<i>I see a suit of armor around the world.</i>

448
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:18,485
- Ultron.
- In the flesh.

449
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:21,237
Or, no, not yet.

450
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:23,740
Not this chrysalis.

451
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:25,533
But I'm ready.

452
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:28,495
I'm on mission.

453
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:31,831
- What mission?
- Peace in our time.

454
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:46,846
Rhodey!

455
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:56,940
Sorry.

456
00:30:56,981 --> 00:30:58,149
- Don't turn green.
- I won't.

457
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:12,789
Come on!

458
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:32,142
- Stark!
<i>- We are here to help.</i>

459
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:33,343
One sec. One sec, I got this.

460
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:34,477
<i>We are here to help.</i>

461
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:39,149
<i>Please back away.</i>

462
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:44,738
Thor!

463
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,157
<i>Is unsafe... is unsafe...</i>

464
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:49,576
- Come on! That's the one.
<i>- ...ls unsafe.</i>

465
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,165
Hey, Cap!

466
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:02,630
That was dramatic.

467
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,718
I'm sorry, I know you mean well.

468
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:08,595
You just didn't think it through.

469
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:13,683
You want to protect the world
but you don't want it to change.

470
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:16,519
How is humanity saved

471
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:19,522
if it's not allowed to evolve?

472
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:24,736
With these? These puppets.

473
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:29,366
There's only one path to peace.

474
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:33,536
The Avengers' extinction.

475
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:44,089
I had strings, but now I'm free.

476
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:51,888
<i>There are no strings on me.</i>

477
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:57,060
<i>There are no strings on me.</i>

478
00:32:57,227 --> 00:32:59,938
<i>But you can see
There are no strings on me.</i>

479
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:04,275
All our work is gone.

480
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:06,820
Ultron cleared out. He used the Internet
as an escape hatch.

481
00:33:07,195 --> 00:33:08,613
Ultron.

482
00:33:08,738 --> 00:33:11,616
He's been in everything.
Files, surveillance.

483
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,369
Probably knows more about us
than we know about each other.

484
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:16,705
He's in your files, he's in the Internet.

485
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:19,416
What if he decides to access
something a little more exciting?

486
00:33:19,582 --> 00:33:20,625
Nuclear codes.

487
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,793
Nuclear codes.

488
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:25,422
Look, we need to make some calls,
assuming we still can.

489
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:27,549
Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.

490
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:30,427
He didn't say "dead." He said "extinct."

491
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:32,095
He also said he killed somebody.

492
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:33,738
There wasn't anyone else
in the building.

493
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:36,141
Yes, there was.

494
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:44,566
What?

495
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:49,279
This is insane.

496
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:51,614
Jarvis was the first line of defense.

497
00:33:51,781 --> 00:33:53,658
He would have shut Ultron down.
It makes sense.

498
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:56,786
No. Ultron could have
assimilated Jarvis.

499
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,622
This isn't strategy. This is

500
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:01,249
rage.

501
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:04,627
It's going around.

502
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:05,962
Come on, use your words, buddy.

503
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:08,465
I have more than enough words
to describe you, Stark.

504
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:09,674
Thor. The Legionnaire.

505
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:16,473
Trail went cold about 100 miles out,
but it's headed north.

506
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:18,308
And it has the scepter.

507
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:20,185
Now we have to retrieve it, again.

508
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:22,145
Genie's out of that bottle.

509
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:23,688
Clear and present is Ultron.

510
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:25,231
I don't understand.

511
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:27,734
You built this program.

512
00:34:29,444 --> 00:34:30,862
Why is it trying to kill us?

513
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:38,828
You think this is funny?

514
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:40,997
No.

515
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:43,541
It's probably not, right?

516
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:46,920
This is very terrible. Is it so...

517
00:34:47,003 --> 00:34:49,172
Is it so... It is. It's so terrible.

518
00:34:49,214 --> 00:34:50,215
This could have been avoided

519
00:34:50,298 --> 00:34:52,539
if you hadn't played with something
you don't understand.

520
00:34:52,592 --> 00:34:55,553
No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny.

521
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,847
It's a hoot
that you don't get why we need this.

522
00:34:58,014 --> 00:35:00,016
Tony, maybe this might not be the time.

523
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:02,394
Really? That's it?

524
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:05,355
You just roll over, show your belly
every time somebody snarls?

525
00:35:05,397 --> 00:35:06,898
Only when I've created a murder bot.

526
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:10,235
We didn't. We weren't even close.
Were we close to an interface?

527
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:14,239
Well, you did something right.
And you did it right here.

528
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:16,116
The Avengers were supposed
to be different than S.H.I.E.L.D.

529
00:35:16,241 --> 00:35:19,244
Anybody remember when
I carried a nuke through a wormhole?

530
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:20,970
- No, it's never come up.
- Saved New York?

531
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:23,248
- Never heard that.
- Recall that?

532
00:35:23,373 --> 00:35:27,377
A hostile alien army came charging
through a hole in space.

533
00:35:27,419 --> 00:35:29,671
We're standing 300 feet below it.

534
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:32,882
We're the Avengers.

535
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:35,135
We can bust arms dealers
all the livelong day,

536
00:35:35,218 --> 00:35:37,470
but that up there, that's...

537
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:40,140
That's the endgame.

538
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:42,642
How were you guys
planning on beating that?

539
00:35:43,268 --> 00:35:44,769
Together.

540
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:49,190
We'll lose.

541
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,652
Then we'll do that together, too.

542
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,907
Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out.

543
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:00,535
And I'd like to find him
before he's ready for us.

544
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:05,623
The world's a big place.
Let's start making it smaller.

545
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,815
Talk, and if you are wasting our time...

546
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:35,278
Did you know this church
is in the exact center of the city?

547
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:40,116
The elders decreed it so that
everyone could be equally close to God.

548
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:41,951
I like that.

549
00:36:42,118 --> 00:36:44,037
The geometry of belief.

550
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:48,500
You're wondering
why you can't look inside my head.

551
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:51,127
Sometimes it's hard.

552
00:36:51,169 --> 00:36:53,546
But sooner or later,
every man shows himself.

553
00:36:55,298 --> 00:36:56,591
I'm sure they do.

554
00:36:57,634 --> 00:37:00,095
But you needed something
more than a man.

555
00:37:00,845 --> 00:37:03,682
That's why you let
Stark take the scepter.

556
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:05,141
I didn't expect,

557
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,312
but I saw Stark's fear.

558
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:11,147
I knew it would control him.

559
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:13,108
Make him self-destruct.

560
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:15,568
Everyone creates the thing they dread.

561
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:19,072
Men of peace create engines of war.

562
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:21,825
Invaders create Avengers.

563
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:23,493
People create

564
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:26,996
smaller people?

565
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:29,624
"Children." I lost the word, there.

566
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:31,876
Children

567
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:34,087
designed to supplant them,

568
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:37,132
to help them end.

569
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:41,011
Is that why you've come,
to end the Avengers?

570
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:43,430
I've come to save the world.

571
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:46,850
But also... Yeah.

572
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:52,689
We'll move out right away.

573
00:37:52,731 --> 00:37:55,692
This is a start, but there's something
we need to begin the real work.

574
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:58,111
- All of these are...
- Me.

575
00:37:58,695 --> 00:38:02,198
I have what the Avengers never will.
Harmony.

576
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,367
They're discordant. Disconnected.

577
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:06,536
Stark's already got them
turning on each other.

578
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:09,039
And when you get inside
the rest of their heads...

579
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,207
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.

580
00:38:11,374 --> 00:38:12,792
And make them martyrs?

581
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:15,170
You need patience.

582
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:17,005
Need to see the big picture.

583
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:20,383
I don't see the big picture.
I have a little picture.

584
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:23,053
I take it out and look at it,

585
00:38:24,012 --> 00:38:25,305
every day.

586
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:28,058
You lost your parents in the bombings.
I've seen the records.

587
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:29,351
The records are not the picture.

588
00:38:29,392 --> 00:38:30,518
Pietro.

589
00:38:30,643 --> 00:38:31,895
No, please.

590
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:38,109
We were 10 years old.
Having dinner, the four of us.

591
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:41,488
When the first shell hits,
two floors below,

592
00:38:41,571 --> 00:38:43,656
it makes a hole in the floor.

593
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,325
It's big.

594
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:47,911
Our parents go in

595
00:38:48,703 --> 00:38:51,790
and the whole building
starts coming apart.

596
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:54,125
I grab her,

597
00:38:54,584 --> 00:38:56,753
roll under the bed,
and the second shell hits.

598
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,130
But it doesn't go off.

599
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:02,801
It just

600
00:39:03,176 --> 00:39:05,261
sits there in the rubble.

601
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:08,473
Three feet from our faces.

602
00:39:09,557 --> 00:39:13,103
And on the side of the shell
is painted one word.

603
00:39:13,186 --> 00:39:14,938
"Stark."

604
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:18,900
We were trapped for two days.

605
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:21,152
Every effort to save us,

606
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:22,779
every shift in the bricks,

607
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:25,448
I think, "This will set it off."

608
00:39:28,576 --> 00:39:32,455
We wait for two days
for Tony Stark to kill us.

609
00:39:34,874 --> 00:39:36,793
I know what they are.

610
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:41,715
I wondered why only you two
survived Strucker's experiments.

611
00:39:42,632 --> 00:39:43,883
Now I don't.

612
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:46,094
We will make it right.

613
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:47,971
You and I can hurt them.

614
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:52,726
But you will tear them apart

615
00:39:54,644 --> 00:39:56,563
<i>from the inside.</i>

616
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:04,320
He's all over the globe.

617
00:40:04,362 --> 00:40:07,657
Robotics labs, weapons facilities,
jet propulsion labs.

618
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:11,870
Reports of a metal man, or men,
coming in and emptying the place.

619
00:40:11,953 --> 00:40:13,038
Fatalities?

620
00:40:13,121 --> 00:40:14,372
Only when engaged.

621
00:40:14,456 --> 00:40:16,124
Mostly guys left in a fugue state

622
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:18,501
going on about old memories,
worst fears,

623
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:20,837
and "something too fast to see."

624
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:22,380
Maximoffs.

625
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:25,342
That makes sense he'd go to them.
They have someone in common.

626
00:40:25,383 --> 00:40:27,385
Not anymore.

627
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:33,183
That's a negative. I answer to you.

628
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:35,560
Yes, ma'am.

629
00:40:35,643 --> 00:40:37,562
Barton. Might have something.

630
00:40:37,687 --> 00:40:39,064
I gotta go.

631
00:40:39,147 --> 00:40:40,357
Who was that?

632
00:40:41,024 --> 00:40:42,400
Girlfriend.

633
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,321
What's this?

634
00:40:46,363 --> 00:40:48,698
A message. Ultron killed Strucker.

635
00:40:49,824 --> 00:40:52,869
And he did a Banksy
at the crime scene, just for us.

636
00:40:52,952 --> 00:40:54,412
This is a smoke screen.

637
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:56,873
Why send a message
when you've just given a speech?

638
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,334
Strucker knew something
that Ultron wanted us to miss.

639
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:00,460
Yeah, I bet he... Yeah.

640
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,546
Everything we had on Strucker's
been erased.

641
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:05,382
Not everything.

642
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:08,968
Known associates.

643
00:41:09,135 --> 00:41:10,720
Baron Strucker had a lot of friends.

644
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:12,389
Well, these people are all horrible.

645
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:14,307
Wait. I know that guy.

646
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:18,311
From back in the day.
He operates off the African coast.

647
00:41:18,436 --> 00:41:19,479
Black market arms.

648
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:22,607
There are conventions. All right?
You meet people.

649
00:41:22,649 --> 00:41:24,818
I didn't sell him anything.

650
00:41:24,901 --> 00:41:26,986
He was talking about finding
something new, a game-changer.

651
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:28,571
It was all very Ahab.

652
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:29,698
This?

653
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:31,408
It's a tattoo, I don't think he had it.

654
00:41:31,574 --> 00:41:34,285
Those are tattoos, this is a brand.

655
00:41:35,578 --> 00:41:39,124
Yeah. It's a word in an African dialect
meaning "thief."

656
00:41:39,624 --> 00:41:41,001
In a much less friendly way.

657
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:43,128
- What dialect?
- Wakanada.

658
00:41:43,211 --> 00:41:44,879
Wakanda.

659
00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:48,925
If this guy got out of Wakanda
with some of their trade goods...

660
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:50,301
I thought your father said
he got the last of it.

661
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:53,430
I don't follow.
What comes out of Wakanda?

662
00:41:54,973 --> 00:41:56,975
The strongest metal on Earth.

663
00:41:58,226 --> 00:41:59,728
Where is this guy now?

664
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:05,775
Salvage Yard African Coast.

665
00:42:25,128 --> 00:42:26,963
Don't tell me your men swindled you.

666
00:42:27,047 --> 00:42:32,135
I sent you six short-range heat-seekers
and got a boat full of rusted parts.

667
00:42:32,302 --> 00:42:33,636
Now, you will make it right,

668
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:37,140
or the next missile I send you
will come very much faster.

669
00:42:38,808 --> 00:42:41,436
Now, minister, where were we?

670
00:43:12,884 --> 00:43:15,845
Yeah. The Enhanced.

671
00:43:16,513 --> 00:43:18,306
Strucker's prize pupils.

672
00:43:21,017 --> 00:43:22,769
Do you want a candy?

673
00:43:24,437 --> 00:43:27,107
I was sorry to hear about Strucker.

674
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:30,318
But then, he knew what kind of world
he was helping create.

675
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:33,196
Human life. Not a growth market.

676
00:43:35,657 --> 00:43:37,659
You didn't know?

677
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:41,663
Is this your first time
intimidating someone?

678
00:43:41,705 --> 00:43:44,249
I'm afraid I'm not that afraid.

679
00:43:44,374 --> 00:43:46,710
Everybody is afraid of something.

680
00:43:46,876 --> 00:43:47,877
Cuttlefish.

681
00:43:49,212 --> 00:43:50,213
Deep sea fish.

682
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:52,382
They make lights, disco lights...

683
00:43:53,883 --> 00:43:55,927
to hypnotize their prey, and then...

684
00:43:57,053 --> 00:43:59,222
I saw a documentary. It was terrifying.

685
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:07,313
So if you're going to fiddle with my brain

686
00:44:08,231 --> 00:44:10,650
and make me see a giant cuttlefish,

687
00:44:10,734 --> 00:44:12,861
then I know you don't do business.

688
00:44:12,902 --> 00:44:15,280
And I know you're not in charge.

689
00:44:15,405 --> 00:44:16,781
And I only deal

690
00:44:17,782 --> 00:44:19,743
with the man in charge.

691
00:44:24,497 --> 00:44:26,916
There is no man in charge.

692
00:44:29,836 --> 00:44:31,588
Let's talk business.

693
00:44:44,476 --> 00:44:47,854
Upon this rock, I will build my church.

694
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:50,482
Vibranium.

695
00:44:51,858 --> 00:44:52,942
You know,

696
00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:56,488
it came at great personal cost.

697
00:44:56,613 --> 00:44:58,448
It's worth billions.

698
00:45:02,702 --> 00:45:04,120
Now so are you.

699
00:45:04,954 --> 00:45:06,748
It's all under your dummy holdings.

700
00:45:06,873 --> 00:45:08,958
Finance is so weird.

701
00:45:10,293 --> 00:45:11,503
But I always say,

702
00:45:11,586 --> 00:45:13,387
"Keep your friends rich
and your enemies rich"

703
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,757
"and wait to find out which is which."

704
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:19,636
Stark.

705
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:22,263
What?

706
00:45:22,305 --> 00:45:24,307
Tony Stark used to say that.

707
00:45:25,475 --> 00:45:26,601
To me.

708
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,853
You're one of his.

709
00:45:28,978 --> 00:45:30,689
What? I'm not...

710
00:45:32,649 --> 00:45:34,150
I'm not.

711
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:35,735
You think I'm one of Stark's puppets?

712
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:36,945
His hollow men?

713
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:39,739
I mean, look at me.
Do I look like Iron Man?

714
00:45:39,823 --> 00:45:41,074
Stark is nothing!

715
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:45,120
I'm sorry. I'm...

716
00:45:45,161 --> 00:45:47,247
I'm sure that's gonna be okay. I'm sorry.

717
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:49,040
It's just that I don't understand.

718
00:45:49,124 --> 00:45:52,210
Don't compare me with Stark!

719
00:45:53,753 --> 00:45:55,338
It's a thing with me.

720
00:45:55,463 --> 00:45:57,340
Stark is... He's a sickness!

721
00:45:57,465 --> 00:45:59,175
Junior.

722
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:02,512
You're gonna break
your old man's heart.

723
00:46:03,847 --> 00:46:04,973
If I have to.

724
00:46:07,183 --> 00:46:08,643
Nobody has to break anything.

725
00:46:08,685 --> 00:46:10,395
Clearly you've never made an omelet.

726
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,855
He beat me by one second.

727
00:46:12,939 --> 00:46:14,274
Yes. He's funny.

728
00:46:14,691 --> 00:46:16,151
Mr. Stark.

729
00:46:16,901 --> 00:46:18,611
It's what? Comfortable?

730
00:46:20,196 --> 00:46:21,573
Like old times?

731
00:46:21,698 --> 00:46:22,741
This was never my life.

732
00:46:22,824 --> 00:46:24,344
You two can still walk away from this.

733
00:46:24,367 --> 00:46:25,702
We will.

734
00:46:25,744 --> 00:46:26,995
I know you've suffered.

735
00:46:27,954 --> 00:46:29,414
Captain America.

736
00:46:29,956 --> 00:46:32,542
God's righteous man.

737
00:46:32,584 --> 00:46:34,961
Pretending you could live without a war.

738
00:46:35,712 --> 00:46:38,631
I can't physically throw up
in my mouth, but...

739
00:46:38,715 --> 00:46:41,009
If you believe in peace,
then let us keep it.

740
00:46:41,301 --> 00:46:44,721
I think you're confusing "peace"
with "quiet."

741
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:46,681
What's the vibranium for?

742
00:46:46,806 --> 00:46:47,891
I'm glad you asked that,

743
00:46:47,974 --> 00:46:51,728
because I wanted to take this time
to explain my evil plan.

744
00:47:11,289 --> 00:47:13,166
- Shoot them.
- Which ones?

745
00:47:13,249 --> 00:47:14,459
All of them!

746
00:47:14,542 --> 00:47:15,877
Move! Move! Move!

747
00:48:04,676 --> 00:48:05,927
Stay down, kid.

748
00:48:08,304 --> 00:48:10,849
It's time for some mind games.

749
00:48:12,142 --> 00:48:14,477
Guys? Is this a code green?

750
00:48:30,326 --> 00:48:31,327
Thor, status.

751
00:48:31,995 --> 00:48:33,955
The girl tried to warp my mind.

752
00:48:33,997 --> 00:48:37,125
Take special care.
I doubt a human could keep her at bay.

753
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,545
Fortunately, I am mighty.

754
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:02,525
This is going very well.

755
00:49:13,995 --> 00:49:15,556
I've done the whole mind control thing.

756
00:49:16,373 --> 00:49:17,540
Not a fan.

757
00:49:24,714 --> 00:49:27,175
Yeah, you better run.

758
00:49:28,718 --> 00:49:30,595
<i>Who's ever standing, we got to move!</i>

759
00:49:32,555 --> 00:49:33,598
<i>Guys?</i>

760
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:52,409
Again.

761
00:49:52,992 --> 00:49:54,244
You'll break them.

762
00:49:54,744 --> 00:49:56,413
Only the breakable ones.

763
00:49:56,955 --> 00:49:58,540
You're made of marble.

764
00:49:58,832 --> 00:50:01,084
We'll celebrate
after the graduation ceremony.

765
00:50:01,918 --> 00:50:03,128
What if I fail?

766
00:50:08,633 --> 00:50:09,926
You never fail.

767
00:50:32,782 --> 00:50:34,701
Are you ready for our dance?

768
00:50:43,918 --> 00:50:44,961
Is it him?

769
00:50:45,128 --> 00:50:47,255
Is that the first son of Odin?

770
00:50:47,756 --> 00:50:49,382
Heimdall, your eyes.

771
00:50:49,883 --> 00:50:51,968
They see everything.

772
00:50:52,135 --> 00:50:54,304
They see you leading us to Hel.

773
00:50:55,472 --> 00:50:56,681
Wake up!

774
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:01,728
The war is over, Steve.

775
00:51:02,145 --> 00:51:03,646
We can go home.

776
00:51:05,231 --> 00:51:06,441
Imagine it.

777
00:51:15,658 --> 00:51:17,410
I can still save you!

778
00:51:17,535 --> 00:51:20,997
We're all dead! Can you not see?

779
00:51:25,543 --> 00:51:28,088
You're a destroyer, Odinson.

780
00:51:31,091 --> 00:51:33,259
See where your power leads.

781
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:45,188
Sloppy.

782
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,524
Pretending to fail.

783
00:51:48,858 --> 00:51:50,318
The ceremony is necessary

784
00:51:51,486 --> 00:51:53,655
for you to take your place in the world.

785
00:51:54,531 --> 00:51:55,782
I have no place in the world.

786
00:51:55,865 --> 00:51:57,033
Exactly.

787
00:52:02,163 --> 00:52:04,124
- What can I do?
- It hurts.

788
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:06,376
I'm going to kill him.

789
00:52:06,418 --> 00:52:07,711
- I'll be right back.
- No.

790
00:52:07,836 --> 00:52:09,170
I'm all right.

791
00:52:10,046 --> 00:52:11,131
I want...

792
00:52:14,092 --> 00:52:16,261
I want to finish the plan.

793
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:18,805
I want the big one.

794
00:52:29,524 --> 00:52:31,276
The vibranium is getting away.

795
00:52:32,068 --> 00:52:33,403
And you're not going anywhere.

796
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:36,364
Of course not. I'm already there.

797
00:52:36,489 --> 00:52:37,574
You'll catch on.

798
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:40,160
But first, you might need
to catch Dr. Banner.

799
00:52:54,758 --> 00:52:56,718
News or footage. Keyword, "Hulk."

800
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:03,433
<i>Natasha, I could really use a lullaby.</i>

801
00:53:03,475 --> 00:53:06,561
That's not gonna happen.
Not for a while.

802
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,813
<i>The whole team is down.</i>

803
00:53:09,272 --> 00:53:10,398
<i>You got no backup here.</i>

804
00:53:11,608 --> 00:53:13,026
I'm calling in Veronica.

805
00:53:24,454 --> 00:53:25,955
We need backup!

806
00:54:04,911 --> 00:54:06,287
Go! Keep moving!

807
00:54:45,618 --> 00:54:47,787
All right, everybody, stand down!

808
00:54:54,044 --> 00:54:55,462
<i>Will you listen to me?</i>

809
00:54:55,587 --> 00:54:58,256
That little witch is messing
with your mind.

810
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:00,592
You're stronger than her.
You're smarter than her.

811
00:55:00,675 --> 00:55:02,218
You're Bruce Banner.

812
00:55:02,927 --> 00:55:04,768
Right, right, right,
don't mention puny Banner.

813
00:55:09,684 --> 00:55:10,685
<i>Okay!</i>

814
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:33,833
In the back?

815
00:55:33,917 --> 00:55:34,959
Dick move, Banner.

816
00:55:46,763 --> 00:55:47,931
Veronica, give me a hand.

817
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:17,270
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.

818
00:56:26,678 --> 00:56:28,358
Okay, pal,
we're gonna get you out of town.

819
00:56:30,348 --> 00:56:31,641
Not that way, not that way.

820
00:56:40,108 --> 00:56:42,110
Come on, Bruce!
You gotta work with me.

821
00:56:55,623 --> 00:56:56,708
<i>Everybody, out!</i>

822
00:57:03,631 --> 00:57:04,799
<i>Going down?</i>

823
00:57:14,392 --> 00:57:15,518
I'm sorry.

824
00:57:29,657 --> 00:57:30,825
Damage report?

825
00:57:31,659 --> 00:57:34,037
That's comprehensive.
Show me something.

826
00:57:45,548 --> 00:57:47,217
How quickly can we buy this building?

827
00:58:19,457 --> 00:58:20,834
- Move! Move! Move!
- Go, go, go!

828
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:25,672
Flank him, flank him!

829
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:17,515
<i>The news is loving you guys.</i>

830
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,143
<i>Nobody else is.</i>

831
00:59:20,643 --> 00:59:22,771
There's been no official call
for Banner's arrest

832
00:59:22,812 --> 00:59:24,981
<i>but it's in the air.</i>

833
00:59:25,482 --> 00:59:26,603
The Stark Relief Foundation?

834
00:59:26,649 --> 00:59:27,984
<i>Already on the scene.</i>

835
00:59:28,068 --> 00:59:29,277
<i>How's the team?</i>

836
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:31,154
Everyone's...

837
00:59:31,279 --> 00:59:34,074
We took a hit. We'll shake it off.

838
00:59:34,199 --> 00:59:38,119
<i>Well, for now, I'd stay in stealth mode
and stay away from here.</i>

839
00:59:39,496 --> 00:59:41,081
So, run and hide?

840
00:59:41,623 --> 00:59:43,124
<i>Until we can find Ultron,</i>

841
00:59:43,249 --> 00:59:46,127
<i>I don't have a lot else to offer.</i>

842
00:59:46,586 --> 00:59:48,129
Neither do we.

843
00:59:54,844 --> 00:59:56,596
Hey, you wanna switch out?

844
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,972
No, I'm good.

845
00:59:58,348 --> 01:00:00,350
If you wanna get some kip,
now's a good time

846
01:00:00,433 --> 01:00:02,018
because we're still a few hours out.

847
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:03,728
Few hours from where?

848
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:05,897
A safe house.

849
01:00:32,298 --> 01:00:33,842
What is this place?

850
01:00:33,883 --> 01:00:35,343
Safe house.

851
01:00:36,261 --> 01:00:37,554
Let's hope.

852
01:00:42,434 --> 01:00:43,518
Honey?

853
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:45,270
I'm home.

854
01:00:47,897 --> 01:00:48,898
Hi.

855
01:00:49,065 --> 01:00:50,150
Company.

856
01:00:50,275 --> 01:00:51,317
Sorry, didn't call ahead.

857
01:00:51,401 --> 01:00:52,569
Hey.

858
01:00:53,236 --> 01:00:54,436
This is an agent of some kind.

859
01:00:54,904 --> 01:00:57,407
Gentlemen, this is Laura.

860
01:00:58,366 --> 01:01:00,243
I know all of your names.

861
01:01:03,288 --> 01:01:04,706
Incoming.

862
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:06,541
- Dad!
- Hi, sweetheart!

863
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:07,792
Hey, buddy.

864
01:01:07,917 --> 01:01:09,419
How are you guys doing?

865
01:01:09,544 --> 01:01:11,588
- These are smaller agents.
- Look at your face!

866
01:01:11,755 --> 01:01:12,839
Oh, my goodness.

867
01:01:12,964 --> 01:01:14,466
Did you bring Auntie Nat?

868
01:01:15,633 --> 01:01:18,094
Why don't you hug her and find out?

869
01:01:19,637 --> 01:01:20,889
Sorry for barging in on you.

870
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:21,973
Yeah, we would have called ahead,

871
01:01:22,057 --> 01:01:24,184
but we were busy having
no idea that you existed.

872
01:01:24,309 --> 01:01:27,270
Yeah, well, Fury helped me
set this up when I joined.

873
01:01:27,937 --> 01:01:30,857
He kept it off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s files.
I'd like to keep it that way.

874
01:01:31,608 --> 01:01:33,360
I figure it's a good place to lay low.

875
01:01:33,485 --> 01:01:34,486
Honey.

876
01:01:35,862 --> 01:01:36,905
I missed you.

877
01:01:36,988 --> 01:01:38,448
How's little Natasha?

878
01:01:38,615 --> 01:01:39,991
She's...

879
01:01:42,118 --> 01:01:43,203
Nathaniel.

880
01:01:45,872 --> 01:01:46,915
Traitor.

881
01:02:02,806 --> 01:02:03,848
Thor?

882
01:02:03,973 --> 01:02:05,975
I saw something in that dream.

883
01:02:06,017 --> 01:02:08,687
I need answers. I won't find them here.

884
01:02:19,155 --> 01:02:20,532
<i>We can go home.</i>

885
01:02:31,918 --> 01:02:33,878
See? You worried for nothing.

886
01:02:33,962 --> 01:02:36,131
Can't even feel the difference, can you?

887
01:02:38,466 --> 01:02:39,718
If they're sleeping here,

888
01:02:39,801 --> 01:02:42,012
some of them are gonna
have to double up.

889
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,890
Yeah, that's not gonna sell.

890
01:02:48,685 --> 01:02:51,354
What about Nat and Dr. Banner?

891
01:02:51,396 --> 01:02:53,398
How long has that been going on?

892
01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:54,733
Has what?

893
01:02:56,026 --> 01:02:57,861
You are so cute.

894
01:02:58,028 --> 01:02:59,571
Nat and Banner?

895
01:03:00,196 --> 01:03:01,573
I'll explain when you're older,

896
01:03:01,698 --> 01:03:02,824
Hawkeye.

897
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:04,534
Well, okay.

898
01:03:06,411 --> 01:03:07,996
It's bad, right?

899
01:03:08,121 --> 01:03:09,789
Nat seems really shaken.

900
01:03:10,707 --> 01:03:12,208
Ultron has these allies.

901
01:03:12,375 --> 01:03:16,421
These kids. They're punks, really.

902
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:20,383
But they carry a big, damn stick.

903
01:03:20,467 --> 01:03:21,968
And Nat took a serious hit.

904
01:03:23,053 --> 01:03:25,513
Someone's gonna have to
teach them some manners.

905
01:03:25,638 --> 01:03:27,390
That someone being you.

906
01:03:28,850 --> 01:03:31,728
You know
I totally support your avenging.

907
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:33,688
I couldn't be prouder.

908
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:36,483
But I see those guys...

909
01:03:36,608 --> 01:03:38,693
Those gods...

910
01:03:40,612 --> 01:03:42,906
You don't think they need me.

911
01:03:43,073 --> 01:03:46,743
I think they do, which is a lot scarier.

912
01:03:47,869 --> 01:03:49,079
They're a mess.

913
01:03:50,663 --> 01:03:51,664
Yeah.

914
01:03:52,415 --> 01:03:54,167
I guess they're my mess.

915
01:03:55,418 --> 01:03:57,420
You need to be sure

916
01:03:57,462 --> 01:04:00,090
that this team is really a team,

917
01:04:00,173 --> 01:04:02,092
and that they have your back.

918
01:04:05,303 --> 01:04:07,931
Things are changing for us.

919
01:04:07,972 --> 01:04:10,475
In a few months' time,

920
01:04:10,558 --> 01:04:13,353
you and me are gonna be outnumbered.

921
01:04:13,436 --> 01:04:14,771
I need...

922
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:19,776
Just be sure.

923
01:04:20,568 --> 01:04:22,070
Yes, ma'am.

924
01:04:31,121 --> 01:04:33,039
I can feel the difference.

925
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:39,504
U-Gin Genetics Research Lab
Seoul, Korea.

926
01:04:46,094 --> 01:04:48,763
Scream, and your entire staff dies.

927
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,976
I could've killed you, Helen,
the night we met.

928
01:04:53,059 --> 01:04:54,185
I didn't.

929
01:04:54,269 --> 01:04:55,854
Do you expect a thank-you note?

930
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:57,731
I expect you to know why.

931
01:04:58,857 --> 01:04:59,858
The Cradle.

932
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:02,402
<i>This is the next thing, Tony.</i>

933
01:05:02,485 --> 01:05:05,613
This is the next me.

934
01:05:05,739 --> 01:05:08,450
The Regeneration Cradle prints tissue.

935
01:05:08,491 --> 01:05:10,160
It can't build a living body.

936
01:05:10,285 --> 01:05:11,327
It can. You can.

937
01:05:11,828 --> 01:05:13,204
You lack the materials.

938
01:05:15,498 --> 01:05:16,958
You're a brilliant woman, Helen.

939
01:05:20,003 --> 01:05:23,673
But we all have room to improve.

940
01:05:44,903 --> 01:05:47,530
I didn't realize you were waiting.

941
01:05:47,572 --> 01:05:48,573
I would've joined you,

942
01:05:48,656 --> 01:05:52,035
but it didn't seem like the right time.

943
01:05:52,911 --> 01:05:55,205
They used up all the hot water.

944
01:05:55,872 --> 01:05:57,290
I should've joined you.

945
01:05:57,415 --> 01:05:59,209
Missed our window.

946
01:05:59,876 --> 01:06:01,211
Did we?

947
01:06:04,714 --> 01:06:06,633
The world just saw the Hulk.

948
01:06:08,426 --> 01:06:10,387
The real Hulk, for the first time.

949
01:06:13,556 --> 01:06:14,557
You know I have to leave.

950
01:06:14,724 --> 01:06:16,267
You assume that I have to stay?

951
01:06:18,228 --> 01:06:20,939
I had this dream.

952
01:06:21,398 --> 01:06:23,400
The kind that seems normal at the time,

953
01:06:24,234 --> 01:06:25,902
but when you wake...

954
01:06:25,985 --> 01:06:27,404
What did you dream?

955
01:06:28,405 --> 01:06:30,240
That I was an Avenger.

956
01:06:32,075 --> 01:06:36,079
That I was anything more
than the assassin they made me.

957
01:06:37,497 --> 01:06:39,666
I think you're being hard on yourself.

958
01:06:41,668 --> 01:06:44,254
Here I was hoping that was your job.

959
01:06:47,132 --> 01:06:48,758
What are you doing?

960
01:06:50,385 --> 01:06:52,220
I'm running with it.

961
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:55,140
With you.

962
01:06:55,807 --> 01:06:58,226
If running is the plan,

963
01:06:59,269 --> 01:07:01,104
as far as you want.

964
01:07:02,939 --> 01:07:04,774
Are you out of your mind?

965
01:07:09,988 --> 01:07:11,489
I want you to understand that...

966
01:07:11,573 --> 01:07:13,116
Natasha,

967
01:07:14,075 --> 01:07:15,577
where can I go?

968
01:07:16,619 --> 01:07:18,872
Where in the world am I not a threat?

969
01:07:18,997 --> 01:07:21,374
- You're not a threat to me.
- Are you sure?

970
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:24,002
Even if I didn't just...

971
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:27,213
There's no future with me.

972
01:07:28,757 --> 01:07:29,758
I can't ever...

973
01:07:29,924 --> 01:07:32,302
I can't have this.

974
01:07:32,969 --> 01:07:34,304
Kids.

975
01:07:34,429 --> 01:07:37,182
Do the math. I physically can't.

976
01:07:38,808 --> 01:07:40,352
Neither can I.

977
01:07:44,981 --> 01:07:48,568
In the Red Room where I was trained...

978
01:07:48,985 --> 01:07:51,529
Where I was raised,

979
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:55,116
they have a graduation ceremony.

980
01:07:56,701 --> 01:07:58,578
They sterilize you.

981
01:08:01,706 --> 01:08:03,208
It's efficient.

982
01:08:06,044 --> 01:08:07,587
One less thing to worry about.

983
01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:12,967
The one thing that might matter more
than a mission.

984
01:08:15,303 --> 01:08:17,222
Makes everything easier.

985
01:08:18,515 --> 01:08:19,933
Even killing.

986
01:08:24,854 --> 01:08:28,024
You still think
you're the only monster on the team?

987
01:08:34,155 --> 01:08:36,282
So, we disappear?

988
01:08:42,706 --> 01:08:44,624
Thor didn't say
where he was going for answers?

989
01:08:45,583 --> 01:08:48,169
Sometimes my teammates
don't tell me things.

990
01:08:49,087 --> 01:08:51,548
I was kind of hoping
Thor would be the exception.

991
01:08:51,715 --> 01:08:53,425
Yeah, give him time.

992
01:08:53,508 --> 01:08:55,677
We don't know
what the Maximoff kid showed him.

993
01:08:57,595 --> 01:08:59,264
"Earth's mightiest heroes."

994
01:08:59,347 --> 01:09:01,057
Pulled us apart like cotton candy.

995
01:09:01,224 --> 01:09:02,726
Seems like you walked away all right.

996
01:09:05,311 --> 01:09:06,312
Is that a problem?

997
01:09:06,438 --> 01:09:08,690
I don't trust a guy without a dark side.

998
01:09:09,774 --> 01:09:10,817
Call me old-fashioned.

999
01:09:10,942 --> 01:09:13,737
Well, let's just say
you haven't seen it yet.

1000
01:09:13,903 --> 01:09:16,197
You know Ultron is trying
to tear us apart, right?

1001
01:09:16,239 --> 01:09:18,450
Well, I guess you'd know.

1002
01:09:18,575 --> 01:09:19,909
Whether you'd tell us
is a bit of a question.

1003
01:09:20,076 --> 01:09:21,202
Banner and I were doing research.

1004
01:09:21,244 --> 01:09:23,580
- That would affect the team.
- That would end the team!

1005
01:09:23,663 --> 01:09:24,831
Isn't that the mission?

1006
01:09:24,956 --> 01:09:26,374
Isn't that the "Why We Fight"?

1007
01:09:26,416 --> 01:09:28,710
So we can end the fight.
So we get to go home!

1008
01:09:31,921 --> 01:09:34,341
Every time someone tries
to win a war before it starts,

1009
01:09:34,424 --> 01:09:37,177
innocent people die. Every time.

1010
01:09:39,554 --> 01:09:40,930
I'm sorry.

1011
01:09:40,972 --> 01:09:41,973
Mr. Stark...

1012
01:09:42,807 --> 01:09:43,975
Clint said you wouldn't mind,

1013
01:09:44,059 --> 01:09:46,603
but our tractor doesn't seem
to want to start at all.

1014
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:49,130
- I thought maybe you might...
- Yeah, I'll give her a kick.

1015
01:09:52,609 --> 01:09:54,277
Don't take from my pile.

1016
01:10:04,454 --> 01:10:05,705
Hello, Deere.

1017
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:09,959
Tell me everything.

1018
01:10:11,127 --> 01:10:12,629
What ails you?

1019
01:10:12,712 --> 01:10:13,797
Do me a favor.

1020
01:10:15,882 --> 01:10:17,884
Try not to bring it to life.

1021
01:10:18,009 --> 01:10:19,594
Why, Ms. Barton, you little minx.

1022
01:10:19,969 --> 01:10:22,514
I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?

1023
01:10:22,597 --> 01:10:23,932
Was she ever not working for you?

1024
01:10:23,973 --> 01:10:25,517
Artificial intelligence.

1025
01:10:26,476 --> 01:10:28,311
You never even hesitated.

1026
01:10:28,436 --> 01:10:29,813
Look, it's been a really long day,

1027
01:10:29,896 --> 01:10:31,564
like Eugene O'Neill long,

1028
01:10:31,648 --> 01:10:33,650
so how's about
we skip to the part where you're useful.

1029
01:10:33,775 --> 01:10:36,444
Look me in the eye and tell me
you're going to shut him down.

1030
01:10:36,569 --> 01:10:38,196
You're not the director of me.

1031
01:10:38,321 --> 01:10:40,115
I'm not the director of anybody.

1032
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,158
I'm just an old man

1033
01:10:42,325 --> 01:10:44,494
who cares very much about you.

1034
01:10:47,163 --> 01:10:49,124
And I'm the man
who killed the Avengers.

1035
01:10:50,667 --> 01:10:52,043
I saw it.

1036
01:10:52,127 --> 01:10:53,712
I didn't tell the team. How could I?

1037
01:10:54,963 --> 01:10:56,840
I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.

1038
01:10:57,173 --> 01:10:58,717
The whole world, too.

1039
01:10:59,092 --> 01:11:00,093
Because of me.

1040
01:11:01,761 --> 01:11:03,054
I wasn't ready.

1041
01:11:04,305 --> 01:11:05,724
I didn't do all I could.

1042
01:11:06,683 --> 01:11:08,852
Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.

1043
01:11:09,394 --> 01:11:10,437
Playing on your fear.

1044
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,981
I wasn't tricked, I was shown.

1045
01:11:13,023 --> 01:11:15,275
Wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.

1046
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,527
The end of the path I started us on.

1047
01:11:18,653 --> 01:11:21,531
You come up with some
pretty impressive inventions, Tony.

1048
01:11:23,033 --> 01:11:24,617
War isn't one of them.

1049
01:11:27,912 --> 01:11:29,706
I watched my friends die.

1050
01:11:29,748 --> 01:11:32,042
You'd think that'd be
as bad as it gets, right?

1051
01:11:33,209 --> 01:11:34,711
Nope.

1052
01:11:35,628 --> 01:11:37,172
It wasn't the worst part.

1053
01:11:37,213 --> 01:11:38,214
The worst part

1054
01:11:39,132 --> 01:11:40,592
is that you didn't.

1055
01:11:47,223 --> 01:11:48,350
I'll see you tonight.

1056
01:11:49,392 --> 01:11:51,019
Royal Holloway
University of London

1057
01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:52,395
I like the look.

1058
01:11:53,355 --> 01:11:56,149
If you're going for inconspicuous,
though, near miss.

1059
01:11:56,316 --> 01:11:57,442
I need your help.

1060
01:11:57,567 --> 01:11:58,735
It's nice to be needed.

1061
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:00,236
It's dangerous.

1062
01:12:00,987 --> 01:12:02,906
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.

1063
01:12:05,742 --> 01:12:09,329
Ultron took you folks out of play
to buy himself time.

1064
01:12:09,412 --> 01:12:12,415
My contacts all say
he's building something.

1065
01:12:12,457 --> 01:12:15,043
The amount of vibranium
he made off with,

1066
01:12:15,168 --> 01:12:16,586
I don't think it's just one thing.

1067
01:12:16,711 --> 01:12:18,171
What about Ultron himself?

1068
01:12:18,254 --> 01:12:20,757
He's easy to track. He's everywhere.

1069
01:12:20,882 --> 01:12:23,551
The guy is multiplying faster
than a Catholic rabbit.

1070
01:12:24,094 --> 01:12:26,971
It still doesn't help us get an angle
on any of his plans, though.

1071
01:12:27,055 --> 01:12:28,390
Is he still going after launch codes?

1072
01:12:28,431 --> 01:12:29,808
Yes, he is.

1073
01:12:29,933 --> 01:12:31,434
But he's not making any headway.

1074
01:12:31,559 --> 01:12:33,561
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall
in high school on a dare.

1075
01:12:33,687 --> 01:12:36,231
Well, I contacted our friends
at the Nexus about that.

1076
01:12:36,356 --> 01:12:37,440
Nexus?

1077
01:12:37,524 --> 01:12:39,442
It's the world internet hub in Oslo.

1078
01:12:39,567 --> 01:12:41,569
Every byte of data flows through there.

1079
01:12:41,611 --> 01:12:42,696
Fastest access on Earth.

1080
01:12:42,779 --> 01:12:43,905
So, what did they say?

1081
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:45,907
He's fixated on the missiles.

1082
01:12:46,032 --> 01:12:47,784
But the codes
are constantly being changed.

1083
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:49,577
By whom?

1084
01:12:50,787 --> 01:12:51,788
Parties unknown.

1085
01:12:51,871 --> 01:12:53,039
Do we have an ally?

1086
01:12:53,123 --> 01:12:55,500
Ultron's got an enemy.
That's not the same thing.

1087
01:12:55,625 --> 01:12:57,711
Still, I'd pay folding money
to know who it is.

1088
01:12:57,794 --> 01:12:59,004
I might need to visit Oslo.

1089
01:12:59,462 --> 01:13:00,672
Find our unknown.

1090
01:13:00,755 --> 01:13:02,173
Well, this is good times, boss,

1091
01:13:02,257 --> 01:13:03,633
but I was kind of hoping
when I saw you,

1092
01:13:03,758 --> 01:13:04,926
you'd have more than that.

1093
01:13:04,968 --> 01:13:07,137
I do. I have you.

1094
01:13:07,846 --> 01:13:11,141
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere.
Ears, everywhere else.

1095
01:13:11,307 --> 01:13:14,477
You kids had all the tech
you could dream up.

1096
01:13:15,437 --> 01:13:17,605
Here we all are, back on Earth,

1097
01:13:17,647 --> 01:13:21,192
with nothing but our wit
and our will to save the world.

1098
01:13:22,736 --> 01:13:24,988
Ultron says the Avengers
are the only thing

1099
01:13:25,071 --> 01:13:26,656
between him and his mission.

1100
01:13:26,781 --> 01:13:28,825
And whether or not he admits it,

1101
01:13:28,992 --> 01:13:31,745
his mission is global destruction.

1102
01:13:32,912 --> 01:13:35,248
All this, laid in a grave.

1103
01:13:37,042 --> 01:13:39,002
So stand.

1104
01:13:39,586 --> 01:13:41,504
Outwit the platinum bastard.

1105
01:13:42,005 --> 01:13:43,673
Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.

1106
01:13:43,757 --> 01:13:44,758
You know what, Romanoff?

1107
01:13:45,842 --> 01:13:47,302
So, what does he want?

1108
01:13:49,012 --> 01:13:50,764
To become better.

1109
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,265
Better than us.

1110
01:13:52,515 --> 01:13:53,933
He keeps building bodies.

1111
01:13:54,059 --> 01:13:55,477
Person bodies.

1112
01:13:55,518 --> 01:13:57,187
The human form is inefficient.

1113
01:13:57,312 --> 01:13:59,481
Biologically speaking, we're outmoded.

1114
01:13:59,606 --> 01:14:01,524
But he keeps coming back to it.

1115
01:14:01,608 --> 01:14:03,777
When you two programmed him
to protect the human race,

1116
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:05,362
you amazingly failed.

1117
01:14:05,445 --> 01:14:07,489
They don't need to be protected.

1118
01:14:07,906 --> 01:14:09,657
They need to evolve.

1119
01:14:11,534 --> 01:14:13,703
Ultron's going to evolve.

1120
01:14:13,828 --> 01:14:14,871
How?

1121
01:14:16,206 --> 01:14:18,917
Has anyone been in contact
with Helen Cho?

1122
01:14:22,587 --> 01:14:24,255
It's beautiful.

1123
01:14:24,381 --> 01:14:27,676
The vibranium atoms aren't just
compatible with the tissue cells,

1124
01:14:27,717 --> 01:14:29,052
they're binding them.

1125
01:14:29,427 --> 01:14:31,028
And S.H.I.E.L.D.
never even thought to...

1126
01:14:31,054 --> 01:14:33,598
The most versatile substance
on the planet,

1127
01:14:33,682 --> 01:14:36,226
and they used it to make a Frisbee.

1128
01:14:36,309 --> 01:14:37,560
Typical of humans.

1129
01:14:37,727 --> 01:14:40,230
They scratch the surface
and never think

1130
01:14:42,107 --> 01:14:43,692
to look within.

1131
01:14:54,202 --> 01:14:55,787
I'll take Natasha and Clint.

1132
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:57,806
All right. Strictly recon.
I'll hit the Nexus.

1133
01:14:57,832 --> 01:14:59,149
I'll join you as soon as I can.

1134
01:14:59,207 --> 01:15:00,709
If Ultron's really building a body...

1135
01:15:00,834 --> 01:15:02,794
He'll be more powerful than any of us.

1136
01:15:02,877 --> 01:15:03,920
Maybe all of us.

1137
01:15:04,087 --> 01:15:06,256
An android designed by a robot.

1138
01:15:06,297 --> 01:15:07,577
You know, I really miss the days

1139
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:09,884
when the weirdest thing
science ever created was me.

1140
01:15:10,301 --> 01:15:12,012
I'll drop Banner off at the tower.

1141
01:15:12,095 --> 01:15:13,555
You mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?

1142
01:15:13,596 --> 01:15:15,432
She's all yours. Apparently.

1143
01:15:15,515 --> 01:15:16,808
What are you gonna do?

1144
01:15:16,891 --> 01:15:20,020
I don't know.
Something dramatic, I hope.

1145
01:15:23,273 --> 01:15:27,152
I'm gonna finish reflooring that sunroom
as soon as I get back.

1146
01:15:27,235 --> 01:15:29,946
Yeah, then you'll find
another part of the house to tear apart.

1147
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:31,197
No.

1148
01:15:31,865 --> 01:15:33,450
It's the last project.

1149
01:15:34,909 --> 01:15:35,952
I promise.

1150
01:15:54,179 --> 01:15:55,764
So, this is it.

1151
01:15:57,307 --> 01:15:59,642
The Water of Sight.

1152
01:16:01,936 --> 01:16:04,356
In every realm, there's a reflection.

1153
01:16:05,482 --> 01:16:06,941
If the water's spirits accept me,

1154
01:16:06,983 --> 01:16:08,985
I can return to my dream

1155
01:16:09,736 --> 01:16:11,321
and find what I missed.

1156
01:16:11,446 --> 01:16:15,325
Men who enter that water,
the legends don't end well.

1157
01:16:16,951 --> 01:16:18,787
A hacker who's faster than Ultron?

1158
01:16:18,828 --> 01:16:19,954
He could be anywhere,

1159
01:16:19,996 --> 01:16:21,873
and as this is the center of everything,

1160
01:16:21,956 --> 01:16:22,957
NEXUS Internet Hub Oslo, Norway

1161
01:16:22,999 --> 01:16:26,419
I'm just a guy looking for a needle
in the world's biggest haystack.

1162
01:16:26,795 --> 01:16:28,672
How do you find it?

1163
01:16:28,755 --> 01:16:31,424
It's pretty simple. You bring a magnet.

1164
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:34,678
<i>I'm decrypting nuclear codes.</i>

1165
01:16:34,761 --> 01:16:36,137
<i>And you don't want me to.</i>

1166
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:39,974
Come and get me.

1167
01:16:52,028 --> 01:16:53,196
Wake up!

1168
01:17:00,078 --> 01:17:01,204
Thor!

1169
01:17:01,996 --> 01:17:03,039
Extinction.

1170
01:17:16,469 --> 01:17:18,722
Cellular cohesion will take a few hours,

1171
01:17:18,888 --> 01:17:21,266
but we can initiate
the consciousness stream.

1172
01:17:21,808 --> 01:17:24,686
We're uploading your cerebral matrix

1173
01:17:24,853 --> 01:17:26,104
now.

1174
01:17:27,522 --> 01:17:29,149
I can read him.

1175
01:17:29,858 --> 01:17:31,443
He's dreaming.

1176
01:17:31,568 --> 01:17:33,403
I wouldn't call it dreams.

1177
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:35,447
It's Ultron's base consciousness.

1178
01:17:35,572 --> 01:17:37,365
Informational noise. Soon...

1179
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:38,742
How soon?

1180
01:17:38,783 --> 01:17:40,243
I'm not being pushy.

1181
01:17:40,368 --> 01:17:42,078
We're imprinting a physical brain.

1182
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,747
There are no shortcuts.

1183
01:17:43,872 --> 01:17:45,165
Even if your magic gem...

1184
01:17:55,759 --> 01:17:56,760
How could you?

1185
01:17:57,218 --> 01:17:58,345
How could I what?

1186
01:17:58,470 --> 01:18:01,765
You said we would
destroy the Avengers,

1187
01:18:01,848 --> 01:18:02,974
make a better world.

1188
01:18:03,099 --> 01:18:04,309
It will be better.

1189
01:18:05,268 --> 01:18:06,269
When everyone is dead?

1190
01:18:06,311 --> 01:18:07,604
That is not...

1191
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:12,400
The human race will have
every opportunity to improve.

1192
01:18:12,859 --> 01:18:13,860
And if they don't?

1193
01:18:14,402 --> 01:18:15,528
Ask Noah.

1194
01:18:16,696 --> 01:18:17,822
You are a madman.

1195
01:18:17,906 --> 01:18:21,409
There were more than a dozen
extinction-level events

1196
01:18:21,451 --> 01:18:24,621
before even the dinosaurs got theirs.

1197
01:18:24,662 --> 01:18:26,873
When the Earth starts to settle,

1198
01:18:27,332 --> 01:18:29,292
God throws a stone at it.

1199
01:18:29,376 --> 01:18:31,711
And, believe me, he's winding up.

1200
01:18:32,462 --> 01:18:33,672
We have to evolve.

1201
01:18:34,214 --> 01:18:35,465
There's no room

1202
01:18:36,216 --> 01:18:37,384
for the weak.

1203
01:18:37,467 --> 01:18:39,636
And who decides who's weak?

1204
01:18:40,387 --> 01:18:42,222
Life.

1205
01:18:42,681 --> 01:18:44,808
Life always decides.

1206
01:18:47,644 --> 01:18:48,645
There's incoming.

1207
01:18:50,105 --> 01:18:52,399
The Quinjet. We have to move.

1208
01:18:52,524 --> 01:18:54,150
That's not a problem.

1209
01:18:59,823 --> 01:19:01,366
Wait, guys!

1210
01:19:05,286 --> 01:19:06,746
They'll understand.

1211
01:19:06,913 --> 01:19:09,165
When they see, they'll understand.

1212
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:12,794
I just need a little more time.

1213
01:19:24,222 --> 01:19:26,349
Two minutes. Stay close.

1214
01:19:33,481 --> 01:19:34,524
Dr. Cho!

1215
01:19:38,445 --> 01:19:40,030
He's uploading himself into the body.

1216
01:19:40,071 --> 01:19:41,197
Where?

1217
01:19:42,907 --> 01:19:45,618
The real power is inside the Cradle.

1218
01:19:45,702 --> 01:19:46,703
The gem,

1219
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:50,165
its power is uncontainable.

1220
01:19:50,999 --> 01:19:52,709
You can't just blow it up.

1221
01:19:53,585 --> 01:19:55,879
You have to get the Cradle to Stark.

1222
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:56,963
First, I have to find it.

1223
01:19:57,339 --> 01:19:58,340
Go.

1224
01:19:58,631 --> 01:20:00,050
<i>Did you guys copy that?</i>

1225
01:20:00,091 --> 01:20:01,176
We did.

1226
01:20:01,301 --> 01:20:03,720
I got a private jet taking off across town.

1227
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:05,555
No manifest.

1228
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:06,681
That could be him.

1229
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:09,184
There. It's a truck from the lab.

1230
01:20:09,309 --> 01:20:10,560
Right above you, Cap.

1231
01:20:10,727 --> 01:20:12,520
On the loop by the bridge.

1232
01:20:13,104 --> 01:20:14,189
It's them.

1233
01:20:14,230 --> 01:20:16,031
You got three with the Cradle,
one in the cab.

1234
01:20:16,816 --> 01:20:17,942
I could take out the driver.

1235
01:20:18,026 --> 01:20:19,235
<i>Negative. That truck crashes,</i>

1236
01:20:19,277 --> 01:20:21,071
the gem could level the city.

1237
01:20:21,154 --> 01:20:23,740
<i>We need to draw out Ultron.</i>

1238
01:20:32,123 --> 01:20:34,334
No, no, no, no.

1239
01:20:35,919 --> 01:20:37,087
Leave me alone!

1240
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:47,430
Well, he's definitely unhappy.

1241
01:20:47,514 --> 01:20:49,057
I'm gonna try and keep him that way.

1242
01:20:49,182 --> 01:20:50,462
You're not a match for him, Cap.

1243
01:20:51,643 --> 01:20:52,727
Thanks, Barton.

1244
01:21:15,291 --> 01:21:16,531
You know what's in that cradle?

1245
01:21:17,877 --> 01:21:19,671
The power to make real change.

1246
01:21:19,754 --> 01:21:21,214
And that terrifies you.

1247
01:21:21,297 --> 01:21:22,457
I wouldn't call it a comfort.

1248
01:21:25,802 --> 01:21:26,803
Stop it.

1249
01:21:37,522 --> 01:21:40,316
We got a window. Four, three...

1250
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:42,027
Give him hell.

1251
01:21:52,829 --> 01:21:54,414
I'm always picking up after you boys.

1252
01:21:55,915 --> 01:21:57,709
They're heading under the overpass.
I've got no shot.

1253
01:21:57,959 --> 01:21:59,002
<i>Which way?</i>

1254
01:21:59,169 --> 01:22:00,253
Hard right.

1255
01:22:01,296 --> 01:22:02,297
Now.

1256
01:22:33,286 --> 01:22:35,622
Out of the way! Coming through!
Sorry, coming through!

1257
01:22:51,388 --> 01:22:52,555
Come on!

1258
01:22:53,515 --> 01:22:55,684
- Clint, can you draw out the guards?
- Let's find out.

1259
01:22:56,643 --> 01:22:57,686
Beep, beep!

1260
01:23:34,973 --> 01:23:36,641
They're heading back towards you.

1261
01:23:36,725 --> 01:23:38,286
So whatever you're gonna do, do it now.

1262
01:23:43,857 --> 01:23:46,526
<i>I'm going in.
Cap, can you keep him occupied?</i>

1263
01:23:47,318 --> 01:23:48,820
What do you think I've been doing?

1264
01:24:32,072 --> 01:24:34,366
<i>Okay, package is airborne.</i>

1265
01:24:34,991 --> 01:24:36,159
I have a clean shot.

1266
01:24:36,534 --> 01:24:37,952
Negative. I am still in the truck.

1267
01:24:37,994 --> 01:24:38,995
- What the hell are you...
- Just be ready.

1268
01:24:39,079 --> 01:24:40,319
I'm sending the package to you.

1269
01:24:40,914 --> 01:24:42,165
How do you want me to take it?

1270
01:24:42,999 --> 01:24:44,479
You might wish you hadn't asked that.

1271
01:24:57,138 --> 01:24:59,057
Please, don't do this.

1272
01:24:59,474 --> 01:25:01,184
What choice do we have?

1273
01:25:09,359 --> 01:25:10,360
I lost him!

1274
01:25:10,443 --> 01:25:11,903
He's headed your way!

1275
01:25:16,866 --> 01:25:17,867
Nat, we gotta go.

1276
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:31,589
Nat!

1277
01:25:35,051 --> 01:25:36,136
Cap, you see Nat?

1278
01:25:36,928 --> 01:25:39,723
If you have the package,
get it to Stark! Go!

1279
01:25:39,806 --> 01:25:41,057
Do you have eyes on Nat?

1280
01:25:41,141 --> 01:25:42,225
<i>Go!</i>

1281
01:25:44,144 --> 01:25:45,228
Damn it.

1282
01:25:45,687 --> 01:25:46,896
Civilians in our path.

1283
01:25:48,064 --> 01:25:49,065
Can you stop this thing?

1284
01:26:28,438 --> 01:26:29,814
I'm fine.

1285
01:26:29,898 --> 01:26:31,608
I just need to take a minute.

1286
01:26:32,067 --> 01:26:33,985
I'm very tempted not to give you one.

1287
01:26:34,069 --> 01:26:36,029
The Cradle. Did you get it?

1288
01:26:36,112 --> 01:26:37,614
Stark will take care of it.

1289
01:26:39,032 --> 01:26:40,033
No, he won't.

1290
01:26:43,453 --> 01:26:45,813
You don't know what you're talking
about. Stark's not crazy.

1291
01:26:45,872 --> 01:26:47,957
He will do anything
to make things right.

1292
01:26:52,921 --> 01:26:54,255
Stark, come in.

1293
01:26:54,673 --> 01:26:55,674
Stark.

1294
01:26:57,050 --> 01:26:58,218
Anyone on comms.

1295
01:26:58,343 --> 01:26:59,803
Ultron can't tell the difference

1296
01:26:59,886 --> 01:27:02,263
between saving the world
and destroying it.

1297
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:06,643
Where do you think he gets that?

1298
01:27:08,812 --> 01:27:10,397
- Anything on Nat?
- I haven't heard.

1299
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:12,899
But she's alive, or Ultron
would be rubbing our faces in it.

1300
01:27:12,982 --> 01:27:14,317
This is sealed tight.

1301
01:27:14,401 --> 01:27:15,944
We're gonna need
to access the program,

1302
01:27:15,985 --> 01:27:17,987
break it down from within.

1303
01:27:19,155 --> 01:27:21,991
Any chance Natasha might leave you
a message outside the Internet?

1304
01:27:22,075 --> 01:27:23,118
Old-school spy stuff?

1305
01:27:23,493 --> 01:27:25,328
There are some nets I can cast.

1306
01:27:25,453 --> 01:27:26,663
Yeah, I'll find her.

1307
01:27:29,290 --> 01:27:31,084
I can work on tissue degeneration

1308
01:27:31,167 --> 01:27:34,462
if you could fry whatever
operational system Cho implanted.

1309
01:27:34,504 --> 01:27:35,630
Yeah, about that.

1310
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:41,094
No.

1311
01:27:41,219 --> 01:27:43,138
- You have to trust me.
- Kind of don't.

1312
01:27:43,263 --> 01:27:47,600
Our ally, the guy protecting
the military's nuclear codes,

1313
01:27:49,227 --> 01:27:50,270
I found him.

1314
01:27:50,353 --> 01:27:51,479
<i>Hello, Dr. Banner.</i>

1315
01:27:52,355 --> 01:27:54,607
Ultron didn't go after Jarvis
because he was angry.

1316
01:27:55,191 --> 01:27:58,862
He attacked him because
he was scared of what he can do.

1317
01:27:59,946 --> 01:28:01,656
So Jarvis went underground.

1318
01:28:01,698 --> 01:28:03,241
Scattered, dumped his memory.

1319
01:28:03,783 --> 01:28:05,326
But not his protocols.

1320
01:28:05,702 --> 01:28:09,205
He didn't even know he was in there
until I pieced him together.

1321
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,838
So, you want me to help you
put Jarvis into this thing?

1322
01:28:16,963 --> 01:28:18,715
No! Of course not.

1323
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:20,550
I wanna help you
put Jarvis in this thing.

1324
01:28:22,886 --> 01:28:24,596
We're out of my field, here.

1325
01:28:24,679 --> 01:28:26,723
You know bio-organics
better than anyone.

1326
01:28:26,890 --> 01:28:29,934
And you just assume
that Jarvis's operational matrix

1327
01:28:30,018 --> 01:28:31,478
can beat Ultron's?

1328
01:28:31,561 --> 01:28:34,898
Jarvis has been beating him from inside
without knowing it.

1329
01:28:34,981 --> 01:28:36,024
This is the opportunity.

1330
01:28:36,066 --> 01:28:37,859
We can create Ultron's perfect self

1331
01:28:37,984 --> 01:28:41,529
without the homicidal glitches
he thinks are his winning personality.

1332
01:28:41,571 --> 01:28:42,614
We have to.

1333
01:28:42,697 --> 01:28:43,740
<i>I believe it's worth a go.</i>

1334
01:28:46,242 --> 01:28:47,327
I'm in a loop!

1335
01:28:47,452 --> 01:28:48,536
I'm caught in a time loop.

1336
01:28:48,578 --> 01:28:50,538
This is exactly where it all went wrong.

1337
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:52,540
I know. I know.
I know what everyone's gonna say.

1338
01:28:52,582 --> 01:28:54,584
But they're already saying it.

1339
01:28:55,085 --> 01:28:56,378
We're mad scientists.

1340
01:28:57,045 --> 01:28:59,798
We're monsters, buddy.
We've gotta own it.

1341
01:29:00,757 --> 01:29:02,050
Make a stand.

1342
01:29:07,347 --> 01:29:08,932
It's not a loop.

1343
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:11,935
It's the end of the line.

1344
01:29:32,372 --> 01:29:34,582
I wasn't sure you would wake up.

1345
01:29:34,624 --> 01:29:38,128
I hoped you would.
I wanted to show you.

1346
01:29:38,253 --> 01:29:39,963
I don't have anyone else.

1347
01:29:42,716 --> 01:29:46,344
I think a lot about meteors.
The purity in them.

1348
01:29:46,469 --> 01:29:48,138
Boom! The end.

1349
01:29:48,471 --> 01:29:49,973
Start again.

1350
01:29:50,056 --> 01:29:52,017
The world made clean

1351
01:29:52,142 --> 01:29:54,477
for the new man to rebuild.

1352
01:29:54,811 --> 01:29:56,980
I was meant to be new.

1353
01:29:57,814 --> 01:30:00,442
I was meant to be beautiful.

1354
01:30:00,984 --> 01:30:03,111
The world would have looked to the sky

1355
01:30:03,153 --> 01:30:04,487
and seen hope,

1356
01:30:04,821 --> 01:30:06,156
seen mercy.

1357
01:30:06,906 --> 01:30:09,034
Instead, they'll look up in horror

1358
01:30:09,117 --> 01:30:10,535
because of you.

1359
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:12,579
You've wounded me.

1360
01:30:13,079 --> 01:30:14,831
I give you full marks for that.

1361
01:30:15,415 --> 01:30:18,418
But, like the man said,
what doesn't kill me...

1362
01:30:23,506 --> 01:30:24,924
just makes me stronger.

1363
01:31:05,006 --> 01:31:07,217
This framework is not compatible.

1364
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:10,053
The genetic coding tower is at 97%.

1365
01:31:10,095 --> 01:31:14,015
You have got to upload that schematic
in the next three minutes.

1366
01:31:16,267 --> 01:31:18,228
- I'm gonna say this once.
- How about "none-ce"?

1367
01:31:18,353 --> 01:31:20,397
- Shut it down!
- Nope, not gonna happen.

1368
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:21,648
You don't know what you're doing.

1369
01:31:21,773 --> 01:31:23,149
And you do?

1370
01:31:23,483 --> 01:31:24,526
She's not in your head?

1371
01:31:24,651 --> 01:31:26,319
I know you're angry.

1372
01:31:26,444 --> 01:31:27,862
We're way past that.

1373
01:31:27,904 --> 01:31:30,365
I could choke the life out of you
and never change a shade.

1374
01:31:30,490 --> 01:31:32,170
Banner, after everything
that's happened...

1375
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,761
It's nothing compared to what's coming!

1376
01:31:33,868 --> 01:31:35,988
- You don't know what's in there.
- This isn't a game!

1377
01:31:39,499 --> 01:31:40,917
No, no. Go on.

1378
01:31:41,793 --> 01:31:43,086
You were saying?

1379
01:31:49,634 --> 01:31:51,011
Pietro!

1380
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:52,721
What?

1381
01:31:53,096 --> 01:31:54,764
You didn't see that coming?

1382
01:31:56,850 --> 01:31:58,059
I'm rerouting the upload.

1383
01:32:04,941 --> 01:32:06,109
Go ahead, piss me off.

1384
01:32:18,371 --> 01:32:19,789
Wait!

1385
01:33:44,207 --> 01:33:46,543
I am sorry. That was

1386
01:33:47,502 --> 01:33:48,920
odd.

1387
01:33:49,087 --> 01:33:50,422
Thank you.

1388
01:33:55,343 --> 01:33:56,344
Thor.

1389
01:33:57,762 --> 01:33:58,805
You helped create this?

1390
01:33:58,930 --> 01:34:00,432
I've had a vision.

1391
01:34:00,557 --> 01:34:04,394
A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life,
and at its center is that.

1392
01:34:05,311 --> 01:34:06,396
What? The gem?

1393
01:34:06,438 --> 01:34:07,522
It's the Mind Stone.

1394
01:34:07,564 --> 01:34:09,065
It's one of the six Infinity Stones.

1395
01:34:09,232 --> 01:34:10,525
The greatest power in the universe,

1396
01:34:10,567 --> 01:34:12,819
unparalleled in
its destructive capabilities.

1397
01:34:12,902 --> 01:34:14,982
- Then why would you bring...
- Because Stark is right.

1398
01:34:15,030 --> 01:34:17,532
It's definitely the end times.

1399
01:34:17,657 --> 01:34:18,742
The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.

1400
01:34:18,825 --> 01:34:20,160
Not alone.

1401
01:34:20,618 --> 01:34:22,620
Why does your Vision
sound like Jarvis?

1402
01:34:22,704 --> 01:34:25,373
We reconfigured Jarvis's matrix

1403
01:34:25,832 --> 01:34:27,709
to create something new.

1404
01:34:27,876 --> 01:34:29,627
I think I've had my fill of new.

1405
01:34:29,711 --> 01:34:32,047
You think I'm a child of Ultron.

1406
01:34:32,339 --> 01:34:33,673
You're not?

1407
01:34:34,758 --> 01:34:36,426
I'm not Ultron.

1408
01:34:36,968 --> 01:34:39,262
I am not Jarvis. I am...

1409
01:34:41,306 --> 01:34:42,766
I am.

1410
01:34:44,601 --> 01:34:45,769
I looked in your head

1411
01:34:46,436 --> 01:34:48,271
and saw annihilation.

1412
01:34:48,438 --> 01:34:49,439
Look again.

1413
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:51,376
Her seal of approval means jack to me.

1414
01:34:51,858 --> 01:34:54,611
Their powers, the horrors in our heads,
Ultron himself,

1415
01:34:54,694 --> 01:34:56,112
they all came from the Mind Stone.

1416
01:34:56,237 --> 01:34:58,448
And they're nothing
compared to what it can unleash.

1417
01:34:58,573 --> 01:35:00,075
- But with it on our side...
- Is it?

1418
01:35:01,493 --> 01:35:02,744
Are you?

1419
01:35:03,536 --> 01:35:04,954
On our side?

1420
01:35:06,831 --> 01:35:08,792
I don't think it's that simple.

1421
01:35:08,875 --> 01:35:11,419
Well, it better get real simple real soon.

1422
01:35:12,504 --> 01:35:14,673
I am on the side of life.

1423
01:35:14,839 --> 01:35:16,299
Ultron isn't.

1424
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,301
He will end it all.

1425
01:35:18,385 --> 01:35:20,387
What's he waiting for?

1426
01:35:20,470 --> 01:35:21,471
- You.
- Where?

1427
01:35:21,888 --> 01:35:23,098
Sokovia.

1428
01:35:23,223 --> 01:35:24,307
He's got Nat there, too.

1429
01:35:26,393 --> 01:35:28,061
If we're wrong about you,

1430
01:35:30,730 --> 01:35:32,730
if you're the monster
that Ultron made you to be...

1431
01:35:33,233 --> 01:35:34,859
What will you do?

1432
01:35:41,408 --> 01:35:43,576
I don't want to kill Ultron.

1433
01:35:43,868 --> 01:35:47,288
He's unique and he's in pain.

1434
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:51,543
But that pain will roll over the Earth.

1435
01:35:51,710 --> 01:35:54,295
So, he must be destroyed.

1436
01:35:54,421 --> 01:35:57,465
Every form he's built,
every trace of his presence on the net.

1437
01:35:57,590 --> 01:35:59,467
We have to act now.

1438
01:35:59,634 --> 01:36:03,638
And not one of us can do it
without the others.

1439
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:07,517
Maybe I am a monster.

1440
01:36:07,684 --> 01:36:10,020
I don't think I'd know if I were one.

1441
01:36:11,146 --> 01:36:12,731
I'm not what you are,

1442
01:36:13,356 --> 01:36:15,608
and not what you intended.

1443
01:36:16,276 --> 01:36:18,820
So, there may be no way
to make you trust me.

1444
01:36:19,029 --> 01:36:20,530
But we need to go.

1445
01:36:35,253 --> 01:36:36,504
Right.

1446
01:36:37,047 --> 01:36:38,381
Well done.

1447
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:41,092
Three minutes.

1448
01:36:41,843 --> 01:36:43,511
Get what you need.

1449
01:36:59,402 --> 01:37:00,403
<i>Good evening, boss.</i>

1450
01:37:05,533 --> 01:37:07,160
<i>No way we all get through this.</i>

1451
01:37:07,285 --> 01:37:09,365
<i>If even one tin soldier
is left standing, we've lost.</i>

1452
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,520
There's gonna be blood on the floor.

1453
01:37:11,581 --> 01:37:12,957
I got no plans tomorrow night.

1454
01:37:13,041 --> 01:37:14,362
I get first crack at the big guy.

1455
01:37:14,834 --> 01:37:16,419
Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.

1456
01:37:16,461 --> 01:37:18,922
That's true. He hates you the most.

1457
01:37:24,219 --> 01:37:26,471
Ultron knows we're coming.

1458
01:37:26,596 --> 01:37:28,807
Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire.

1459
01:37:29,307 --> 01:37:31,101
And that's what we signed up for.

1460
01:37:31,267 --> 01:37:34,104
But the people of Sokovia, they didn't.

1461
01:37:34,979 --> 01:37:36,523
<i>So our priority</i>

1462
01:37:37,148 --> 01:37:38,274
<i>is getting them out.</i>

1463
01:37:38,358 --> 01:37:41,361
We're under attack! Clear the city! Now!

1464
01:37:49,202 --> 01:37:50,745
Get off your asses.

1465
01:37:51,913 --> 01:37:53,832
<i>All they want
is to live their lives in peace.</i>

1466
01:37:54,416 --> 01:37:55,777
<i>And that's not gonna happen today.</i>

1467
01:37:57,377 --> 01:37:59,129
<i>But we can do our best to protect them.</i>

1468
01:37:59,796 --> 01:38:01,423
<i>And we can get the job done.</i>

1469
01:38:04,718 --> 01:38:07,012
<i>We find out
what Ultron's been building,</i>

1470
01:38:07,971 --> 01:38:09,639
<i>we find Romanoff,</i>

1471
01:38:10,098 --> 01:38:11,975
<i>and we clear the field.</i>

1472
01:38:13,309 --> 01:38:15,270
<i>Keep the fight between us.</i>

1473
01:38:21,985 --> 01:38:24,404
Ultron thinks we're monsters.

1474
01:38:24,904 --> 01:38:27,365
That we're what's wrong with the world.

1475
01:38:27,490 --> 01:38:29,826
This isn't just about beating him.

1476
01:38:30,285 --> 01:38:32,370
It's about whether he's right.

1477
01:38:38,793 --> 01:38:39,878
Natasha!

1478
01:38:41,004 --> 01:38:42,005
Natasha!

1479
01:38:42,088 --> 01:38:43,256
Bruce?

1480
01:38:44,549 --> 01:38:45,633
You all right?

1481
01:38:45,675 --> 01:38:46,843
Yeah.

1482
01:38:47,010 --> 01:38:48,678
The team is in the city.
It's about to light up.

1483
01:38:48,845 --> 01:38:51,006
I don't suppose you found
a key lying around somewhere.

1484
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:53,391
Yeah. I did.

1485
01:38:59,814 --> 01:39:01,024
So what's our play?

1486
01:39:01,149 --> 01:39:02,525
I'm here to get you to safety.

1487
01:39:03,193 --> 01:39:04,194
Job's not finished.

1488
01:39:04,361 --> 01:39:07,864
We could help with the evacuation,
but I can't be in a fight near civilians.

1489
01:39:09,115 --> 01:39:10,367
And you've done plenty.

1490
01:39:12,702 --> 01:39:14,245
Our fight is over.

1491
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:18,291
So, we just disappear?

1492
01:39:22,587 --> 01:39:24,047
Come on.

1493
01:39:28,593 --> 01:39:30,929
<i>Your man's in the church, boss.</i>

1494
01:39:31,012 --> 01:39:32,889
<i>I think he's waiting for you.</i>

1495
01:39:36,893 --> 01:39:38,937
Come to confess your sins?

1496
01:39:39,062 --> 01:39:40,397
I don't know. How much time you got?

1497
01:39:40,438 --> 01:39:42,023
More than you.

1498
01:39:44,317 --> 01:39:47,195
Have you been juicing?
Little vibranium cocktail?

1499
01:39:47,237 --> 01:39:49,572
You're looking...
I don't wanna say "puffy."

1500
01:39:49,739 --> 01:39:51,408
You're stalling to protect the people.

1501
01:39:51,783 --> 01:39:54,786
Well, that is the mission.
Did you forget?

1502
01:39:54,911 --> 01:39:57,414
I've moved beyond your mission.
I'm free.

1503
01:40:02,210 --> 01:40:03,294
What?

1504
01:40:04,129 --> 01:40:06,548
You think you were
the only one stalling?

1505
01:40:07,257 --> 01:40:08,883
<i>There's the rest of the vibranium.</i>

1506
01:40:08,925 --> 01:40:10,427
<i>Function, still unclear.</i>

1507
01:40:10,552 --> 01:40:12,262
This is how you end, Tony.

1508
01:40:12,971 --> 01:40:14,764
This is peace in my time.

1509
01:40:31,448 --> 01:40:32,490
Go!

1510
01:40:37,996 --> 01:40:39,414
Get off the bridge!

1511
01:40:43,626 --> 01:40:44,627
Run!

1512
01:40:46,588 --> 01:40:48,340
Ultron.

1513
01:40:53,845 --> 01:40:55,180
My Vision.

1514
01:40:55,305 --> 01:40:57,599
They really did take
everything from me.

1515
01:40:57,724 --> 01:40:59,851
You set the terms.
You can change them.

1516
01:40:59,976 --> 01:41:01,186
All right.

1517
01:41:25,335 --> 01:41:26,586
Friday, the Vision?

1518
01:41:26,670 --> 01:41:27,712
<i>Boss, it's working.</i>

1519
01:41:27,796 --> 01:41:30,396
<i>He's burning Ultron out of the net.
He won't escape through there.</i>

1520
01:41:35,095 --> 01:41:36,513
You shut me out.

1521
01:41:37,013 --> 01:41:38,306
You think I care?

1522
01:41:40,225 --> 01:41:41,434
You take away my world,

1523
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:44,229
I take away yours.

1524
01:42:28,565 --> 01:42:29,858
Friday.

1525
01:42:29,899 --> 01:42:32,402
<i>Sokovia is going for a ride.</i>

1526
01:42:44,831 --> 01:42:46,374
Do you see

1527
01:42:46,791 --> 01:42:48,418
the beauty of it?

1528
01:42:48,918 --> 01:42:50,920
The inevitability.

1529
01:42:51,004 --> 01:42:54,341
You rise, only to fall.

1530
01:42:57,052 --> 01:43:00,722
<i>You, Avengers, you are my meteor.</i>

1531
01:43:00,764 --> 01:43:02,515
<i>My swift and terrible sword.</i>

1532
01:43:02,724 --> 01:43:04,267
<i>And the earth will crack</i>

1533
01:43:04,392 --> 01:43:06,269
<i>with the weight of your failure.</i>

1534
01:43:07,979 --> 01:43:11,775
<i>Purge me from your computers,
turn my own flesh against me.</i>

1535
01:43:12,067 --> 01:43:13,151
<i>It means nothing.</i>

1536
01:43:13,777 --> 01:43:15,528
<i>When the dust settles,</i>

1537
01:43:15,612 --> 01:43:17,572
<i>the only thing living in this world</i>

1538
01:43:18,573 --> 01:43:19,616
<i>will be metal.</i>

1539
01:43:24,454 --> 01:43:25,789
We gotta move.

1540
01:43:26,122 --> 01:43:27,243
You're not gonna turn green?

1541
01:43:27,374 --> 01:43:30,085
I've got a compelling reason
not to lose my cool.

1542
01:43:30,377 --> 01:43:31,378
I adore you.

1543
01:43:40,387 --> 01:43:42,555
But I need the other guy.

1544
01:43:47,143 --> 01:43:48,978
Let's finish the job.

1545
01:44:05,704 --> 01:44:07,080
I really hope this makes us even.

1546
01:44:09,416 --> 01:44:10,417
Now go be a hero.

1547
01:44:19,926 --> 01:44:21,928
<i>The vibranium core's
got a magnetic field.</i>

1548
01:44:22,053 --> 01:44:24,055
<i>That's what's keeping
the rock together.</i>

1549
01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:25,181
If it drops?

1550
01:44:25,265 --> 01:44:26,599
<i>Right now,
the impact will kill thousands.</i>

1551
01:44:26,683 --> 01:44:29,352
<i>Once it gets high enough?
Global extinction.</i>

1552
01:44:33,690 --> 01:44:35,859
<i>That building's not clear.
The 10th floor.</i>

1553
01:44:40,655 --> 01:44:41,656
Hi.

1554
01:44:42,782 --> 01:44:44,075
Okay.

1555
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:45,160
Get in the tub!

1556
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,835
<i>I got airborne,
heading up to the bridge.</i>

1557
01:44:56,588 --> 01:44:57,881
Cap, you got incoming.

1558
01:44:58,048 --> 01:44:59,674
Incoming already came in.

1559
01:45:02,344 --> 01:45:04,804
Stark, you worry about
bringing the city back down safely.

1560
01:45:05,472 --> 01:45:07,265
<i>The rest of us have one job,</i>

1561
01:45:07,390 --> 01:45:08,641
<i>tear these things apart.</i>

1562
01:45:08,933 --> 01:45:10,602
<i>You get hurt, hurt them back.</i>

1563
01:45:11,227 --> 01:45:12,395
<i>You get killed,</i>

1564
01:45:13,396 --> 01:45:14,731
walk it off.

1565
01:45:49,349 --> 01:45:50,350
Go, go, go!

1566
01:45:56,022 --> 01:45:57,774
How could I let this happen?

1567
01:45:57,941 --> 01:45:58,942
Hey, hey, you okay?

1568
01:45:59,025 --> 01:46:00,068
This is all our fault.

1569
01:46:00,110 --> 01:46:01,111
Hey, look at me.

1570
01:46:01,194 --> 01:46:03,488
It's your fault, it's everyone's fault.
Who cares?

1571
01:46:03,571 --> 01:46:05,073
Are you up for this?

1572
01:46:05,198 --> 01:46:06,199
Are you?

1573
01:46:06,783 --> 01:46:09,953
Look, I just need to know.
Because the city is flying.

1574
01:46:10,245 --> 01:46:14,165
Okay. Look, the city is flying,
we're fighting an army of robots,

1575
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,292
and I have a bow and arrow.

1576
01:46:16,376 --> 01:46:17,502
None of this makes sense.

1577
01:46:20,755 --> 01:46:22,841
But I'm going back out there
because it's my job.

1578
01:46:23,717 --> 01:46:26,469
Okay? And I can't do my job
and babysit.

1579
01:46:26,511 --> 01:46:29,639
It doesn't matter what you did
or what you were.

1580
01:46:29,806 --> 01:46:32,308
If you go out there, you fight,
and you fight to kill.

1581
01:46:33,351 --> 01:46:35,992
Stay in here, you're good.
I'll send your brother to come find you.

1582
01:46:36,062 --> 01:46:37,939
But if you step out that door,

1583
01:46:38,815 --> 01:46:39,858
you are an Avenger.

1584
01:46:44,696 --> 01:46:46,531
All right. Good chat.

1585
01:46:50,285 --> 01:46:51,327
Yeah, the city is flying.

1586
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:26,446
I got you!

1587
01:47:26,821 --> 01:47:28,073
Just look at me!

1588
01:47:34,829 --> 01:47:36,164
<i>You can't save them all.</i>

1589
01:47:37,624 --> 01:47:38,625
You'll never...

1590
01:47:39,626 --> 01:47:40,627
"Never" what?

1591
01:47:40,919 --> 01:47:42,212
You didn't finish!

1592
01:47:45,965 --> 01:47:47,592
What, were you napping?

1593
01:48:09,072 --> 01:48:10,073
Thor.

1594
01:48:12,742 --> 01:48:14,285
You're bothering me.

1595
01:48:49,696 --> 01:48:50,976
All right, we're all clear here.

1596
01:48:50,989 --> 01:48:52,157
We are not clear!

1597
01:48:52,240 --> 01:48:53,700
We are very not clear!

1598
01:48:56,536 --> 01:48:57,537
All right, coming to you.

1599
01:48:58,496 --> 01:48:59,831
Keep up, old man!

1600
01:49:02,334 --> 01:49:03,918
Nobody would know.

1601
01:49:04,669 --> 01:49:05,795
Nobody.

1602
01:49:07,630 --> 01:49:10,633
"The last I saw him,
an Ultron was sitting on him."

1603
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:12,635
"Yeah, he'll be missed,
that quick little bastard."

1604
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:13,720
"I miss him already."

1605
01:49:29,235 --> 01:49:30,445
Hold your fire!

1606
01:49:40,330 --> 01:49:41,331
Romanoff!

1607
01:49:41,831 --> 01:49:42,874
Thanks!

1608
01:49:52,258 --> 01:49:53,927
<i>The anti-gravs are rigged to flip.</i>

1609
01:49:54,010 --> 01:49:56,221
<i>Touch them,
they'll go full reverse thrust.</i>

1610
01:49:56,304 --> 01:49:57,764
<i>The city's not coming down slow.</i>

1611
01:49:57,847 --> 01:49:58,890
Spire is vibranium.

1612
01:49:58,973 --> 01:50:00,350
If I get Thor to hit it...

1613
01:50:00,433 --> 01:50:01,893
<i>It will crack. That's not enough.</i>

1614
01:50:01,976 --> 01:50:03,520
<i>The impact would still be devastating.</i>

1615
01:50:03,603 --> 01:50:04,964
Maybe if we can cap the other end.

1616
01:50:05,188 --> 01:50:06,856
Keep the atomic action doubling back.

1617
01:50:06,940 --> 01:50:08,274
<i>That could vaporize the city.</i>

1618
01:50:09,275 --> 01:50:11,194
<i>And everyone on it.</i>

1619
01:50:16,991 --> 01:50:18,868
The next wave is gonna hit any minute.

1620
01:50:18,952 --> 01:50:20,870
- What do you got, Stark?
<i>- Nothing great.</i>

1621
01:50:21,746 --> 01:50:24,040
Maybe a way to blow up the city.

1622
01:50:24,082 --> 01:50:25,458
That'll keep it
from impacting the surface,

1623
01:50:25,542 --> 01:50:26,626
if you guys can get clear.

1624
01:50:26,793 --> 01:50:28,670
I asked for a solution,
not an escape plan.

1625
01:50:28,795 --> 01:50:31,881
<i>Impact radius
is getting bigger every second.</i>

1626
01:50:32,048 --> 01:50:33,409
<i>We're gonna have to make a choice.</i>

1627
01:50:34,050 --> 01:50:35,719
Cap, these people are going nowhere.

1628
01:50:36,469 --> 01:50:37,929
If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...

1629
01:50:38,013 --> 01:50:39,014
Not till everyone's safe.

1630
01:50:39,723 --> 01:50:42,767
Everyone up here versus everyone
down there? There's no math there.

1631
01:50:42,892 --> 01:50:44,686
I'm not leaving this rock
with one civilian on it.

1632
01:50:44,811 --> 01:50:46,312
I didn't say we should leave.

1633
01:50:49,232 --> 01:50:51,109
There's worse ways to go.

1634
01:50:56,489 --> 01:50:58,992
Where else am I gonna get
a view like this?

1635
01:50:59,868 --> 01:51:02,412
<i>Glad you like the view, Romanoff.</i>

1636
01:51:02,579 --> 01:51:04,080
<i>It's about to get better.</i>

1637
01:51:28,271 --> 01:51:29,439
<i>Nice, right?</i>

1638
01:51:29,606 --> 01:51:32,108
Pulled her out of mothballs
with a couple of old friends.

1639
01:51:32,150 --> 01:51:33,777
She's dusty, but she'll do.

1640
01:51:34,152 --> 01:51:35,612
Fury, you son of a bitch.

1641
01:51:35,945 --> 01:51:38,114
You kiss your mother with that mouth?

1642
01:51:38,239 --> 01:51:40,492
Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.

1643
01:51:40,617 --> 01:51:42,118
Lifeboats secure to deploy.

1644
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:44,913
Disengage in three, two...

1645
01:51:46,081 --> 01:51:47,082
Take them out.

1646
01:51:56,716 --> 01:51:58,343
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.?

1647
01:51:58,426 --> 01:52:00,887
This is what S.H.I.E.L.D.
is supposed to be.

1648
01:52:02,472 --> 01:52:03,932
This is not so bad.

1649
01:52:07,185 --> 01:52:08,520
Let's load them up.

1650
01:52:13,942 --> 01:52:17,821
Sir, we have multiple bogies
converging on our starboard flank.

1651
01:52:18,113 --> 01:52:19,322
Show 'em what we got.

1652
01:52:19,739 --> 01:52:20,740
You're up.

1653
01:52:25,954 --> 01:52:26,996
Yes!

1654
01:52:27,163 --> 01:52:28,957
Now this is gonna be a good story.

1655
01:52:31,584 --> 01:52:33,670
Yup. If you live to tell it.

1656
01:52:33,795 --> 01:52:35,880
You think I can't hold my own?

1657
01:52:35,964 --> 01:52:37,565
We get through this, I'll hold your own.

1658
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:39,551
You had to make it weird.

1659
01:52:44,347 --> 01:52:47,350
I got about 50 to 100 more
coming in after this group.

1660
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:05,702
Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.

1661
01:53:06,077 --> 01:53:07,078
Let's go, everyone!

1662
01:53:09,581 --> 01:53:11,666
Number six boat is topped and locked...

1663
01:53:11,708 --> 01:53:14,169
Or stocked... Topped...

1664
01:53:14,669 --> 01:53:16,087
It's full of people.

1665
01:53:17,839 --> 01:53:18,923
Incoming!

1666
01:53:21,926 --> 01:53:23,053
Oh, God!

1667
01:53:33,521 --> 01:53:34,773
<i>You think you're saving anyone?</i>

1668
01:53:36,608 --> 01:53:38,943
I turn that key
and drop this rock a little early

1669
01:53:39,027 --> 01:53:40,904
and it's still billions dead.

1670
01:53:41,321 --> 01:53:42,447
Even you can't stop that.

1671
01:53:42,572 --> 01:53:45,200
I am Thor, son of Odin,

1672
01:53:45,241 --> 01:53:47,494
and as long as there is life
in my breast...

1673
01:53:47,660 --> 01:53:50,080
I am running out of things to say!

1674
01:53:50,163 --> 01:53:51,164
Are you ready?

1675
01:53:58,838 --> 01:53:59,964
It's terribly well-balanced.

1676
01:54:00,340 --> 01:54:03,843
Well, if there's too much weight,
you lose power on the swing, so...

1677
01:54:04,761 --> 01:54:07,472
I got it. Create a heat seal.

1678
01:54:07,847 --> 01:54:08,848
I could...

1679
01:54:08,973 --> 01:54:11,351
I could supercharge
the spire from below.

1680
01:54:11,476 --> 01:54:12,727
<i>Running numbers.</i>

1681
01:54:22,737 --> 01:54:24,781
<i>A heat seal could work
with enough power.</i>

1682
01:54:24,864 --> 01:54:26,866
- Thor, I got a plan.
<i>- We're out of time.</i>

1683
01:54:26,991 --> 01:54:28,326
<i>They're coming for the core.</i>

1684
01:54:28,410 --> 01:54:30,286
Rhodey, get the rest of the people
on board that carrier.

1685
01:54:30,328 --> 01:54:31,329
On it.

1686
01:54:31,413 --> 01:54:33,623
Avengers, time to work for a living.

1687
01:54:42,632 --> 01:54:43,967
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

1688
01:54:45,385 --> 01:54:46,469
Romanoff.

1689
01:54:46,636 --> 01:54:49,139
You and Banner better not be
playing "hide the zucchini."

1690
01:54:49,180 --> 01:54:50,181
<i>Relax, shellhead.</i>

1691
01:54:50,515 --> 01:54:52,058
Not all of us can fly.

1692
01:54:57,731 --> 01:54:59,482
- What's the drill?
- This is the drill.

1693
01:54:59,566 --> 01:55:01,776
If Ultron gets a hand
on the core, we lose.

1694
01:55:06,322 --> 01:55:08,324
Is that the best you can do?

1695
01:55:18,209 --> 01:55:19,753
You had to ask.

1696
01:55:19,878 --> 01:55:22,297
This is the best I can do.

1697
01:55:22,339 --> 01:55:24,007
This is exactly what I wanted.

1698
01:55:24,341 --> 01:55:25,675
All of you

1699
01:55:25,842 --> 01:55:27,510
against all of me.

1700
01:55:27,677 --> 01:55:29,888
How can you possibly hope to stop me?

1701
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:32,640
Well, like the old man said...

1702
01:55:33,933 --> 01:55:34,976
Together.

1703
01:57:03,898 --> 01:57:06,317
You know,
with the benefit of hindsight...

1704
01:57:15,493 --> 01:57:16,693
They'll try to leave the city.

1705
01:57:16,703 --> 01:57:18,413
We can't let them,
not even one. Rhodey.

1706
01:57:18,830 --> 01:57:19,831
I'm on it.

1707
01:57:20,248 --> 01:57:21,624
No. I didn't say you could leave.

1708
01:57:22,208 --> 01:57:24,377
War Machine coming at you! Right...

1709
01:57:30,675 --> 01:57:32,135
Okay, what?

1710
01:57:32,302 --> 01:57:34,387
We gotta move out.
Even I can tell the air is getting thin.

1711
01:57:34,471 --> 01:57:35,805
You guys get to the boats.

1712
01:57:35,889 --> 01:57:37,730
I'll sweep for stragglers.
Be right behind you.

1713
01:57:37,807 --> 01:57:39,225
What about the core?

1714
01:57:39,392 --> 01:57:40,393
I'll protect it.

1715
01:57:42,312 --> 01:57:43,313
It's my job.

1716
01:57:44,522 --> 01:57:45,523
Nat.

1717
01:57:45,857 --> 01:57:46,900
This way.

1718
01:57:51,279 --> 01:57:52,572
Get the people on the boats.

1719
01:57:52,655 --> 01:57:53,656
I'm not going to leave you here.

1720
01:57:53,740 --> 01:57:54,866
I can handle this.

1721
01:57:57,118 --> 01:57:58,411
Come back for me
when everyone else is off.

1722
01:57:58,536 --> 01:57:59,704
Not before.

1723
01:58:00,288 --> 01:58:01,831
You understand?

1724
01:58:02,832 --> 01:58:04,542
You know,
I'm 12 minutes older than you.

1725
01:58:04,751 --> 01:58:06,044
Go.

1726
01:58:07,629 --> 01:58:09,172
<i>Boss, power levels are way below...</i>

1727
01:58:09,214 --> 01:58:11,424
Reroute everything.
We get one shot at this.

1728
01:58:16,304 --> 01:58:17,639
I know what I need to do.

1729
01:58:17,931 --> 01:58:19,015
The dining room.

1730
01:58:19,307 --> 01:58:20,517
If I knock out that east wall,

1731
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:22,824
it'd make a nice workspace
for Laura, huh?

1732
01:58:24,270 --> 01:58:25,522
Put up some baffling.

1733
01:58:25,563 --> 01:58:27,691
She can't hear the kids running around.
What do you think?

1734
01:58:27,774 --> 01:58:29,067
You guys always eat
in the kitchen anyway.

1735
01:58:29,150 --> 01:58:30,735
No one eats in a dining room.

1736
01:58:36,408 --> 01:58:37,529
We don't have a lot of time.

1737
01:58:38,034 --> 01:58:40,078
So get your ass on a boat.

1738
01:58:52,966 --> 01:58:54,175
Hey, big guy.

1739
01:58:55,885 --> 01:58:57,679
Sun's getting real low.

1740
01:58:58,221 --> 01:59:00,890
You're safe now.
You're gonna be okay. Buckle up.

1741
01:59:03,393 --> 01:59:05,020
Secure your gear, find a seat.

1742
01:59:05,061 --> 01:59:06,396
Costel!

1743
01:59:07,397 --> 01:59:08,648
We were in the market.

1744
01:59:08,773 --> 01:59:09,816
Costel!

1745
01:59:24,414 --> 01:59:26,458
Thor, I'm gonna need you
back in the church.

1746
01:59:26,624 --> 01:59:28,084
- Is this the last of them?
- Yeah.

1747
01:59:28,460 --> 01:59:29,502
Everyone else is on the carrier.

1748
01:59:29,586 --> 01:59:30,754
<i>You know, this works,</i>

1749
01:59:31,379 --> 01:59:32,756
we maybe don't walk away.

1750
01:59:33,465 --> 01:59:34,549
Maybe not.

1751
01:59:53,693 --> 01:59:57,280
<i>I got no strings, so I have fun.</i>

1752
01:59:57,697 --> 02:00:00,492
<i>I'm not tied up to anyone.</i>

1753
02:00:01,951 --> 02:00:03,328
Come on. Time to go.

1754
02:00:35,777 --> 02:00:37,862
You didn't see that coming?

1755
02:01:34,044 --> 02:01:35,879
For God's sake.

1756
02:01:52,062 --> 02:01:53,938
- Zrinka!
- Costel! Baby!

1757
02:02:06,326 --> 02:02:07,369
No, no, I'm fine.

1758
02:02:07,494 --> 02:02:08,578
Fine.

1759
02:02:10,413 --> 02:02:12,499
It's been a long day.

1760
02:02:26,971 --> 02:02:28,264
Wanda.

1761
02:02:28,932 --> 02:02:32,227
If you stay here, you'll die.

1762
02:02:33,728 --> 02:02:35,188
I just did.

1763
02:02:35,939 --> 02:02:37,649
Do you know how it felt?

1764
02:02:51,788 --> 02:02:54,082
It felt like that.

1765
02:03:29,075 --> 02:03:30,744
Thor, on my mark.

1766
02:03:45,842 --> 02:03:46,843
Now!

1767
02:04:14,871 --> 02:04:17,248
<i>Hey, big guy. We did it.</i>

1768
02:04:18,291 --> 02:04:19,959
<i>The job is finished.</i>

1769
02:04:20,210 --> 02:04:22,879
<i>Now I need you to turn
this bird around, okay?</i>

1770
02:04:27,133 --> 02:04:28,968
We can't track you in stealth mode.

1771
02:04:31,054 --> 02:04:33,306
<i>So help me out. I need you...</i>

1772
02:05:18,893 --> 02:05:19,978
You're afraid.

1773
02:05:20,895 --> 02:05:21,938
Of you?

1774
02:05:22,647 --> 02:05:23,898
Of death.

1775
02:05:24,524 --> 02:05:26,401
You're the last one.

1776
02:05:26,568 --> 02:05:29,112
You were supposed to be the last.

1777
02:05:29,279 --> 02:05:31,614
Stark asked for a savior

1778
02:05:32,532 --> 02:05:34,284
and settled for a slave.

1779
02:05:34,367 --> 02:05:36,870
I suppose we are both disappointments.

1780
02:05:39,205 --> 02:05:40,457
I suppose we are.

1781
02:05:41,207 --> 02:05:42,375
Humans are odd.

1782
02:05:44,210 --> 02:05:47,922
They think order and chaos
are somehow opposites

1783
02:05:49,591 --> 02:05:50,967
and try to control what won't be.

1784
02:05:52,635 --> 02:05:55,138
But there is grace in their failings.

1785
02:05:55,472 --> 02:05:57,432
I think you missed that.

1786
02:05:58,016 --> 02:05:59,184
They're doomed.

1787
02:06:00,018 --> 02:06:01,144
Yes.

1788
02:06:05,273 --> 02:06:08,276
But a thing isn't beautiful
because it lasts.

1789
02:06:10,278 --> 02:06:12,364
It's a privilege to be among them.

1790
02:06:12,489 --> 02:06:15,116
You're unbearably naive.

1791
02:06:15,325 --> 02:06:16,618
Well...

1792
02:06:18,620 --> 02:06:20,747
I was born yesterday.

1793
02:07:10,839 --> 02:07:14,884
New Avengers Facility
Upstate New York.

1794
02:07:33,236 --> 02:07:34,320
<i>Look! Say hi to Auntie Nat!</i>

1795
02:07:36,740 --> 02:07:37,824
Fat.

1796
02:07:38,908 --> 02:07:40,269
One of our tech boys flagged this.

1797
02:07:41,161 --> 02:07:43,455
Splashed down in the Banda Sea.

1798
02:07:44,622 --> 02:07:46,124
Could be the Quinjet.

1799
02:07:46,499 --> 02:07:49,919
But with Stark's stealth tech,
we still can't track the damn thing.

1800
02:07:51,421 --> 02:07:52,839
Right.

1801
02:07:53,214 --> 02:07:55,467
Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.

1802
02:07:56,760 --> 02:07:58,678
He'll send a postcard.

1803
02:07:58,928 --> 02:08:00,680
"Wish you were here."

1804
02:08:02,599 --> 02:08:05,810
You sent me to recruit him
way back when.

1805
02:08:07,687 --> 02:08:10,273
Did you know then
what was gonna happen?

1806
02:08:12,442 --> 02:08:14,444
You never know.

1807
02:08:14,611 --> 02:08:18,114
You hope for the best,
then make do with what you get.

1808
02:08:18,573 --> 02:08:19,991
I got a great team.

1809
02:08:21,159 --> 02:08:23,161
Nothing lasts forever.

1810
02:08:23,453 --> 02:08:25,538
Trouble, Ms. Romanoff.

1811
02:08:25,705 --> 02:08:29,042
No matter who wins or loses,
trouble still comes around.

1812
02:08:32,962 --> 02:08:34,214
<i>The rules have changed.</i>

1813
02:08:34,339 --> 02:08:35,924
We're dealing with something new.

1814
02:08:36,049 --> 02:08:37,467
The Vision is artificial intelligence.

1815
02:08:37,509 --> 02:08:39,511
- A machine.
- So, it doesn't count?

1816
02:08:39,594 --> 02:08:41,395
No, it's not like
a person lifting the hammer.

1817
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:43,431
Right, different rules for us.

1818
02:08:43,473 --> 02:08:44,516
- Nice guy. Artificial.
- Thank you.

1819
02:08:44,641 --> 02:08:47,602
He can wield the hammer,
he can keep the Mind Stone.

1820
02:08:48,603 --> 02:08:50,772
It's safe with the Vision.

1821
02:08:50,939 --> 02:08:53,483
And these days, safe is in short supply.

1822
02:08:55,485 --> 02:08:57,487
But if you put the hammer
in an elevator...

1823
02:08:57,612 --> 02:08:59,413
- It would still go up.
- Elevator's not worthy.

1824
02:08:59,489 --> 02:09:01,366
I'm gonna miss these little talks of ours.

1825
02:09:01,449 --> 02:09:03,118
Not if you don't leave.

1826
02:09:03,159 --> 02:09:05,036
I have no choice.

1827
02:09:05,161 --> 02:09:07,372
The Mind Stone is the fourth
of the Infinity Stones

1828
02:09:07,497 --> 02:09:08,873
to show up in the last few years.

1829
02:09:08,998 --> 02:09:10,625
It's not a coincidence.

1830
02:09:11,376 --> 02:09:13,211
Someone has been playing
an intricate game

1831
02:09:13,294 --> 02:09:15,005
and has made pawns of us.

1832
02:09:15,046 --> 02:09:16,923
And once all these pieces
are in position...

1833
02:09:17,048 --> 02:09:18,550
Triple Yahtzee.

1834
02:09:18,675 --> 02:09:20,135
You think you can find out
what's coming?

1835
02:09:20,260 --> 02:09:21,344
I do.

1836
02:09:22,095 --> 02:09:23,680
Besides this one,

1837
02:09:23,763 --> 02:09:26,099
there's nothing that can't be explained.

1838
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:35,984
That man has no regard
for lawn maintenance.

1839
02:09:39,112 --> 02:09:41,823
I'm gonna miss him, though.
And you're gonna miss me.

1840
02:09:41,865 --> 02:09:43,616
There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.

1841
02:09:45,618 --> 02:09:47,370
I will miss you, Tony.

1842
02:09:47,537 --> 02:09:48,538
Yeah?

1843
02:09:48,663 --> 02:09:51,249
Well, it's time for me to tap out.

1844
02:09:51,332 --> 02:09:53,585
Maybe I should take a page
out of Barton's book.

1845
02:09:53,668 --> 02:09:56,671
Build Pepper a farm,
hope nobody blows it up.

1846
02:09:57,297 --> 02:09:58,548
The simple life.

1847
02:09:58,715 --> 02:10:00,050
You'll get there one day.

1848
02:10:00,091 --> 02:10:01,092
I don't know.

1849
02:10:01,343 --> 02:10:03,803
Family, stability...

1850
02:10:04,888 --> 02:10:08,099
The guy who wanted all that
went in the ice 75 years ago.

1851
02:10:09,517 --> 02:10:11,394
I think someone else came out.

1852
02:10:15,440 --> 02:10:16,441
You all right?

1853
02:10:19,110 --> 02:10:20,570
I'm home.

1854
02:10:28,453 --> 02:10:31,247
You wanna keep staring at the wall,
or do you wanna go to work?

1855
02:10:31,414 --> 02:10:32,791
I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.

1856
02:10:32,874 --> 02:10:35,960
I thought you and Tony were
still gazing into each other's eyes.

1857
02:10:36,044 --> 02:10:37,045
How do we look?

1858
02:10:37,253 --> 02:10:39,589
Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.

1859
02:10:39,673 --> 02:10:41,466
We got some hitters.

1860
02:10:41,549 --> 02:10:44,052
They're good. They're not a team.

1861
02:10:44,094 --> 02:10:45,720
Let's beat them into shape.

1862
02:11:04,197 --> 02:11:05,824
Avengers...

1863
02:13:24,587 --> 02:13:26,089
Fine.
