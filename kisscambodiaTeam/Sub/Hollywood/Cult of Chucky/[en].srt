1
00:00:42,215 --> 00:00:45,655
The Second Amendment
isn't just obsolete. It's dangerous.

2
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:47,737
I totally get why you think that.

3
00:00:48,055 --> 00:00:51,975
I'm sorry, I've just never known
someone who's into guns before.

4
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:53,655
I'm not into guns, Rachel.

5
00:00:53,735 --> 00:00:55,305
I have a couple.

6
00:00:57,135 --> 00:00:58,655
More than the one.

7
00:00:58,735 --> 00:01:00,655
That doesn't mean that I'm a fanatic.

8
00:01:00,735 --> 00:01:02,575
Okay, it doesn't mean
that I'm not for restrictions

9
00:01:02,655 --> 00:01:05,095
and waiting periods and background checks.

10
00:01:05,175 --> 00:01:07,781
So what does it mean, Andy?

11
00:01:07,895 --> 00:01:10,415
I just wanna be able to protect myself.

12
00:01:10,495 --> 00:01:12,179
From what, exactly?

13
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:20,935
You googled me.

14
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:22,426
Yeah, I did.

15
00:01:23,175 --> 00:01:24,381
Fucking Internet.

16
00:01:24,495 --> 00:01:26,543
You have a very dark past.

17
00:01:27,615 --> 00:01:28,696
Yeah.

18
00:01:28,975 --> 00:01:30,855
So why didn't you tell me?

19
00:01:30,935 --> 00:01:32,505
Because I like you.

20
00:01:33,015 --> 00:01:35,302
I didn't wanna scare you away.

21
00:01:38,215 --> 00:01:39,546
I was six.

22
00:01:40,255 --> 00:01:41,780
My babysitter was murdered.

23
00:01:51,455 --> 00:01:56,375
Along with my teacher and my caseworker
and 37 other people over the years...

24
00:01:56,455 --> 00:01:58,139
That I'm aware of.

25
00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:00,146
And they never caught him?

26
00:02:00,895 --> 00:02:04,058
Put it this way, justice was done.

27
00:02:04,655 --> 00:02:06,020
- Wait!
- Play with this.

28
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:10,575
Look, Andy,

29
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:14,785
I think you're a nice guy,
but, uh, this is just too much for me.

30
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:18,341
I get it.

31
00:02:18,815 --> 00:02:20,146
I should go.

32
00:03:17,535 --> 00:03:18,900
Ah.

33
00:04:41,335 --> 00:04:43,815
I guess it's just me
and you again tonight, pal.

34
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:50,144
Give me a hit off that, will you?

35
00:05:06,735 --> 00:05:08,021
Ah!

36
00:05:09,695 --> 00:05:10,821
You wanna play?

37
00:05:16,935 --> 00:05:18,300
Let's play.

38
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,620
What about Rachel?

39
00:05:22,175 --> 00:05:24,337
Didn't she wanna play?

40
00:05:27,655 --> 00:05:29,657
Now we'll never know
if she's a natural redhead.

41
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:38,775
Face it, Andy.

42
00:05:38,855 --> 00:05:41,017
I'm all you've got.

43
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:46,259
Sometimes, it's nice,
just hanging out on a Friday night

44
00:05:49,655 --> 00:05:51,703
with your best friend.

45
00:05:53,655 --> 00:05:54,861
Fuck you!

46
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,221
Again.

47
00:07:58,215 --> 00:07:59,655
I thought you said she was paralyzed.

48
00:07:59,735 --> 00:08:00,975
She is.

49
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:03,735
That's just the juice.

50
00:08:07,175 --> 00:08:08,215
See?

51
00:08:08,295 --> 00:08:11,105
From the waist down, she's a pincushion.

52
00:08:11,855 --> 00:08:13,857
All right, that's enough.

53
00:08:22,095 --> 00:08:23,859
I can still see him

54
00:08:25,015 --> 00:08:26,665
in my nightmares.

55
00:08:28,895 --> 00:08:33,025
His twisted face, that horrible laugh,

56
00:08:33,735 --> 00:08:38,135
the glint off his blade,
the screams of his victims.

57
00:08:38,215 --> 00:08:40,058
Whose victims, Nica?

58
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,698
The murders were real.

59
00:08:44,255 --> 00:08:45,745
You know that.

60
00:08:46,535 --> 00:08:48,295
But Chucky never was.

61
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,456
That's right.

62
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:51,745
He was a fantasy.

63
00:08:51,975 --> 00:08:53,255
A delusion.

64
00:08:53,335 --> 00:08:57,135
He was a mask I wore
so I could go on looking in the mirror,

65
00:08:57,935 --> 00:09:00,135
so I could live with myself.

66
00:09:00,215 --> 00:09:03,295
And now, when you look
in the mirror, what do you see?

67
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,900
I don't look.

68
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,584
You'll have to, if you're ever
gonna learn to forgive yourself.

69
00:09:11,095 --> 00:09:14,144
Nica, you've made tremendous progress.

70
00:09:17,535 --> 00:09:22,175
In the past four years, you've had to accept
some hard truths about yourself.

71
00:09:22,255 --> 00:09:23,984
That is very brave.

72
00:09:24,935 --> 00:09:26,585
I'm proud of you.

73
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,024
I'm having you transferred to Harrogate.

74
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:38,262
That's medium security, Nica.

75
00:09:38,735 --> 00:09:44,055
That means more privacy,
more independence, more freedom,

76
00:09:44,135 --> 00:09:45,375
within reason, of course...

77
00:09:45,495 --> 00:09:47,623
Dr. Foley, what I did was unforgivable.

78
00:09:48,495 --> 00:09:50,782
Schizophrenia is an illness.

79
00:09:51,935 --> 00:09:56,775
By definition, and according to the law,
you weren't responsible for your actions.

80
00:09:56,855 --> 00:10:00,775
Do you think Alice would accept that as
an apology for making her an orphan?

81
00:10:37,295 --> 00:10:39,059
Are there no cameras?

82
00:10:39,335 --> 00:10:41,303
Not in medium security.

83
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:44,135
But don't abuse the privilege.

84
00:10:44,215 --> 00:10:45,775
Bathroom's back there.

85
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:50,338
Shower's handicap-friendly, but if you
need help, ask for Ashley or Pam.

86
00:10:50,655 --> 00:10:52,255
They alternate days.

87
00:10:52,335 --> 00:10:54,215
Anything else, just let me know.

88
00:10:54,295 --> 00:10:55,342
My name's Carlos.

89
00:10:57,855 --> 00:10:59,186
Thanks for being so nice.

90
00:11:00,175 --> 00:11:02,735
Don't misunderstand. I'm not a fan.

91
00:11:02,815 --> 00:11:05,295
We're not gonna be friends.
I'm just doing my job.

92
00:11:07,855 --> 00:11:09,215
Well, thank you anyway.

93
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:10,865
You're welcome.

94
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,139
You in an accident?

95
00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:26,696
I was born like this.

96
00:11:29,575 --> 00:11:31,225
My husband has MS.

97
00:11:33,335 --> 00:11:34,541
I'm sorry.

98
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,343
I don't let it keep him
from living his life.

99
00:12:02,415 --> 00:12:05,624
Dr. Foley, your assistance
is needed in room two.

100
00:12:05,895 --> 00:12:08,216
Dr. Foley to room two, please.

101
00:12:47,215 --> 00:12:48,546
Excuse me.

102
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,135
Can you see me?

103
00:12:54,135 --> 00:12:55,175
Yeah.

104
00:12:55,255 --> 00:12:56,586
Oh, thank God.

105
00:12:57,775 --> 00:12:59,618
None of the others can see me.

106
00:13:01,135 --> 00:13:02,535
Please don't be afraid.

107
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,821
I'm not afraid of you.

108
00:13:04,135 --> 00:13:05,216
Good.

109
00:13:05,975 --> 00:13:07,659
I won't hurt you.

110
00:13:08,415 --> 00:13:10,065
I just need someone to talk to.

111
00:13:11,575 --> 00:13:13,100
I spent my whole life here.

112
00:13:13,975 --> 00:13:15,340
Then I died.

113
00:13:16,935 --> 00:13:18,460
Right here in this room...

114
00:13:19,975 --> 00:13:22,015
A long, long time ago.

115
00:13:22,095 --> 00:13:23,335
That's awful.

116
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,975
Angela, we can all see you.

117
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,136
Fuck you!

118
00:13:31,455 --> 00:13:33,344
Go haunt somebody else now.

119
00:13:35,735 --> 00:13:37,015
Ah, she's harmless.

120
00:13:37,095 --> 00:13:39,615
They found her living
on the street, like, 30 years ago,

121
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:41,823
but I guess being dead's
more exotic than being homeless.

122
00:13:42,415 --> 00:13:43,621
I don't know about that.

123
00:13:43,735 --> 00:13:46,375
Well, I've never been dead before,
but I have been homeless,

124
00:13:46,455 --> 00:13:48,901
and it's pretty fucking colorless.

125
00:13:49,415 --> 00:13:50,462
I'm Michael.

126
00:13:51,175 --> 00:13:52,175
Nica.

127
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,095
Do you wanna, uh...

128
00:13:54,175 --> 00:13:56,177
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

129
00:14:02,455 --> 00:14:04,423
Where'd you get the gum?

130
00:14:05,415 --> 00:14:06,621
Oh, um, Carlos.

131
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,495
Carlos?

132
00:14:08,575 --> 00:14:09,701
Wow.

133
00:14:10,295 --> 00:14:11,456
You must have made quite the impression.

134
00:14:12,295 --> 00:14:13,415
Not really.

135
00:14:13,495 --> 00:14:15,735
No, he's kind of a hard-ass.

136
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:18,819
But Nurse Ashley, she's my guardian angel.

137
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,142
Wasn't for her, I'd still be in detox.

138
00:14:28,255 --> 00:14:30,215
So, uh, you just transferred?

139
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:31,376
Yup.

140
00:14:31,735 --> 00:14:33,100
Where from?

141
00:14:33,735 --> 00:14:35,021
- Lochmoor.
- Oh.

142
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,540
Oh.

143
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,375
Oh, you're that girl who...

144
00:14:41,455 --> 00:14:42,741
Yeah.

145
00:14:45,455 --> 00:14:47,025
You still have a thing for redheads?

146
00:14:49,415 --> 00:14:50,416
What?

147
00:14:51,575 --> 00:14:54,579
'Cause the... This, you... No.

148
00:14:55,335 --> 00:14:57,064
Oh. Sorry. That's too soon.

149
00:15:01,135 --> 00:15:03,263
I'll trade you for a cigarette.

150
00:15:04,615 --> 00:15:05,776
Okay.

151
00:15:12,655 --> 00:15:13,941
Oh.

152
00:15:14,255 --> 00:15:15,416
Juicy Fruit.

153
00:15:15,575 --> 00:15:16,576
Mmm.

154
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:19,621
Huh.

155
00:15:38,215 --> 00:15:39,865
- So why'd you do it?
- Claire.

156
00:15:39,975 --> 00:15:42,455
We're all wondering
the same thing here, right?

157
00:15:42,535 --> 00:15:44,095
Give her a break, okay? She's new.

158
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:45,175
Fuck that!

159
00:15:45,255 --> 00:15:46,700
If I'm gonna be living down the hallway

160
00:15:46,815 --> 00:15:49,775
from someone who butchered her whole family,
I have a right to know what set her off.

161
00:15:49,855 --> 00:15:51,055
Well, why'd you burn your house down?

162
00:15:51,135 --> 00:15:52,295
You always bring that up.

163
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,255
I'm just saying, if we're pointing
fingers here, then...

164
00:15:54,335 --> 00:15:55,695
I didn't kill anyone.

165
00:15:55,775 --> 00:15:56,856
Neither did Nica.

166
00:15:58,215 --> 00:15:59,296
Chucky did it.

167
00:16:06,975 --> 00:16:10,696
I don't blame you for being
afraid after what I did.

168
00:16:11,495 --> 00:16:13,065
I was very ill.

169
00:16:13,695 --> 00:16:16,215
Are you feeling better now?

170
00:16:16,295 --> 00:16:20,295
I understand your concerns, and,
absolutely, we should talk about it,

171
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:23,415
but, believe me, Nica isn't
a danger to anyone anymore.

172
00:16:23,495 --> 00:16:26,745
And let's not forget, she isn't the only one
here to benefit from an insanity plea.

173
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:29,620
She's the only multiple murderer, though.

174
00:16:30,015 --> 00:16:31,575
Mass murderer, actually.

175
00:16:31,655 --> 00:16:33,215
There's a difference.

176
00:16:33,295 --> 00:16:35,536
Who cares? We're all sick.

177
00:16:35,655 --> 00:16:37,862
I wanna know why she killed them.

178
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:48,016
I was pathologically jealous of my sister,

179
00:16:48,855 --> 00:16:53,144
and I was always too possessive
of Alice, who is my niece.

180
00:16:54,695 --> 00:16:57,460
She's 12 now, and I'll never see her again.

181
00:16:58,215 --> 00:17:00,375
I only hope she's doing okay.

182
00:17:00,455 --> 00:17:01,536
She's not okay.

183
00:17:07,455 --> 00:17:08,661
Excuse me?

184
00:17:14,215 --> 00:17:15,899
Chucky told me.

185
00:17:19,575 --> 00:17:20,935
Angela.

186
00:17:21,015 --> 00:17:22,735
He called me.

187
00:17:22,815 --> 00:17:24,146
On the phone.

188
00:17:26,055 --> 00:17:28,581
He said to tell you he's coming for you...

189
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:32,903
Now that you can have visitors.

190
00:17:49,615 --> 00:17:51,265
You think this is funny?

191
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:55,701
No.

192
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:58,261
I don't.

193
00:18:02,095 --> 00:18:03,904
It's okay, Angie.

194
00:18:04,655 --> 00:18:06,020
It's okay.

195
00:18:06,855 --> 00:18:09,375
Okay, it was inevitable
that this would come up.

196
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:12,459
And it's important that we all
explore it together as a group.

197
00:18:13,615 --> 00:18:16,380
I think I have something that will help.

198
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:30,582
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?

199
00:18:31,855 --> 00:18:32,895
Whoa!

200
00:18:32,975 --> 00:18:34,495
- Is that a...
- It's just a Good Guy doll,

201
00:18:34,575 --> 00:18:36,535
one of thousands made back in the '80s.

202
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,735
No, he said, "Chucky"!

203
00:18:37,815 --> 00:18:40,375
They had 50 different names.
Two percent of them were "Chucky."

204
00:18:40,455 --> 00:18:43,623
- You're saying it's a coincidence?
- Not at all. I paid for a Chucky.

205
00:18:44,135 --> 00:18:45,261
Where'd you get it?

206
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:46,822
Hot Topic.

207
00:18:49,015 --> 00:18:51,415
Nica, this doesn't make you
uncomfortable, does it?

208
00:18:51,495 --> 00:18:53,145
No, not at all.

209
00:18:54,415 --> 00:18:55,780
Oh, my God.

210
00:19:02,255 --> 00:19:04,144
What is it, Madeleine?

211
00:19:05,615 --> 00:19:07,105
He's my baby.

212
00:19:19,255 --> 00:19:20,336
Oh.

213
00:19:26,775 --> 00:19:28,584
Open up, sweetheart.

214
00:19:29,455 --> 00:19:31,537
Here comes the choo-choo.

215
00:19:36,335 --> 00:19:38,255
It's too hot for him.

216
00:19:38,335 --> 00:19:39,939
I like to be hugged.

217
00:19:41,015 --> 00:19:43,415
I can't believe he's talking already!

218
00:19:43,495 --> 00:19:44,656
Madeleine, stop it!

219
00:19:45,815 --> 00:19:48,295
Your baby is dead. You know that.

220
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,415
What is your problem?
Why can't you just let her be happy?

221
00:19:50,495 --> 00:19:52,055
You think that's the way to make her happy?

222
00:19:52,135 --> 00:19:54,297
Letting her play house
with some psycho killer's trophy?

223
00:19:55,615 --> 00:19:57,015
- Give him back.
- "Him"?

224
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,135
That's an interesting choice of pronoun.

225
00:19:59,215 --> 00:20:02,495
Are you still having trouble separating
reality from that sick shit in your head?

226
00:20:02,575 --> 00:20:03,655
No.

227
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:06,466
Unfortunately, these days,
reality is painfully clear.

228
00:20:06,575 --> 00:20:07,975
Now give him back.

229
00:20:08,055 --> 00:20:09,575
What are you gonna do, Nica?

230
00:20:09,655 --> 00:20:12,135
You gonna stab me? Cut my throat?

231
00:20:12,215 --> 00:20:13,495
Chop off my head?

232
00:20:13,575 --> 00:20:15,095
Don't be ridiculous.

233
00:20:15,175 --> 00:20:17,335
We don't even have access to real cutlery.

234
00:20:17,415 --> 00:20:20,975
The only thing I could get my hands on are
the barbiturates they give me every morning

235
00:20:21,055 --> 00:20:22,895
that I've been stockpiling for months,

236
00:20:22,975 --> 00:20:25,501
waiting for the right bitch
to come along to poison.

237
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:36,736
Here.

238
00:20:37,415 --> 00:20:38,462
Thank you.

239
00:20:39,935 --> 00:20:41,346
- Sure.
- Are you okay, Chucky?

240
00:20:41,935 --> 00:20:43,335
I'm Mark, by the way.

241
00:20:43,415 --> 00:20:45,099
It's nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

242
00:20:47,095 --> 00:20:48,096
What?

243
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:50,696
From Michael.

244
00:20:52,535 --> 00:20:57,225
He's in the pool right now, getting ready
for Tokyo in 2020, but don't tell anyone.

245
00:20:57,695 --> 00:20:59,220
Michael Phelps?

246
00:21:00,095 --> 00:21:01,460
He's retired.

247
00:21:03,455 --> 00:21:04,820
Oh. Oh.

248
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,735
God, this is embarrassing.

249
00:21:06,815 --> 00:21:09,215
I fucking hate it when this happens,
especially around a pretty girl.

250
00:21:09,295 --> 00:21:11,535
It's actually one of my triggers.

251
00:21:11,615 --> 00:21:13,575
His real name is Malcolm.

252
00:21:13,655 --> 00:21:15,215
We call him Multiple Malcolm.

253
00:21:15,295 --> 00:21:17,059
Nobody calls me that.

254
00:21:25,935 --> 00:21:26,935
Excuse me.

255
00:21:26,975 --> 00:21:29,455
Nica, you have a visitor.

256
00:21:45,975 --> 00:21:49,661
Nica, this is Ms. Valentine,
your niece's legal guardian.

257
00:22:00,295 --> 00:22:02,184
You're Alice's guardian?

258
00:22:02,935 --> 00:22:04,380
That's right.

259
00:22:05,015 --> 00:22:07,780
I'm sorry, but you seem really familiar.

260
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,895
Did anyone ever tell you,
you look exactly like Jennifer Tilly?

261
00:22:10,975 --> 00:22:12,943
Yeah, I get that a lot.

262
00:22:15,615 --> 00:22:17,743
You're not quite what I expected, either.

263
00:22:18,455 --> 00:22:19,895
What did you expect?

264
00:22:19,975 --> 00:22:21,735
Somebody taller.

265
00:22:21,815 --> 00:22:24,386
You don't seem very dangerous.

266
00:22:25,415 --> 00:22:27,144
You don't seem very motherly.

267
00:22:28,175 --> 00:22:29,301
Huh.

268
00:22:32,415 --> 00:22:33,701
How is she?

269
00:22:35,055 --> 00:22:36,784
She's dead, Miss Pierce.

270
00:22:41,455 --> 00:22:42,581
What?

271
00:22:42,815 --> 00:22:43,896
Ms. Valentine, I wish you had told me.

272
00:22:45,095 --> 00:22:46,381
Oh, didn't I?

273
00:22:47,175 --> 00:22:48,695
Uh, I'm terribly sorry.

274
00:22:48,775 --> 00:22:52,063
I've just been going
through an awful ordeal.

275
00:22:56,255 --> 00:23:00,419
But she's in a better place now, I know it.

276
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:03,815
What happened?

277
00:23:03,895 --> 00:23:09,895
I'm no doctor, Miss Pierce,
but I think it was a broken heart.

278
00:23:16,255 --> 00:23:18,656
She wanted you to have something.

279
00:23:26,575 --> 00:23:29,695
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?

280
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,895
- That's not the same...
- No, no.

281
00:23:31,975 --> 00:23:34,975
This is the doll that they used
in Alice's therapy.

282
00:23:35,055 --> 00:23:37,535
To help her get over the past.

283
00:23:37,615 --> 00:23:41,176
She thought that maybe
it would help you, too.

284
00:23:41,935 --> 00:23:44,097
There you go.

285
00:23:45,055 --> 00:23:46,055
Aw.

286
00:23:46,135 --> 00:23:47,855
That's so sweet.

287
00:23:47,935 --> 00:23:51,462
Well, thank you so much.

288
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:57,866
Good luck.

289
00:24:05,335 --> 00:24:06,575
I can't...

290
00:26:16,695 --> 00:26:17,981
Ah.

291
00:26:45,495 --> 00:26:46,985
Where's Nica?

292
00:26:47,535 --> 00:26:49,375
Last door on the right.

293
00:26:49,455 --> 00:26:50,980
You can see me.

294
00:26:51,455 --> 00:26:53,219
Yeah, I can see you.

295
00:26:53,855 --> 00:26:55,141
Don't be afraid.

296
00:26:55,975 --> 00:26:57,056
What?

297
00:26:57,815 --> 00:26:59,544
I'm not going to hurt you.

298
00:27:01,135 --> 00:27:02,655
You fucking with me?

299
00:27:02,735 --> 00:27:03,782
No.

300
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:05,706
I'm not.

301
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:10,815
Tell you the truth, I'm happy to have
the company, even if you aren't real.

302
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:14,104
Okay, let me explain something to you.

303
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:20,455
I am a vintage, mass-marketed
children's toy from the '80s,

304
00:27:20,535 --> 00:27:23,375
standing right in front of you,

305
00:27:23,455 --> 00:27:27,176
holding a very sharp scalpel.

306
00:27:27,815 --> 00:27:29,101
No, you're not.

307
00:27:29,535 --> 00:27:30,821
Yes, I am.

308
00:27:31,335 --> 00:27:33,144
I'm a schizophrenic.

309
00:27:33,415 --> 00:27:34,935
I see things.

310
00:27:35,015 --> 00:27:38,906
Aren't you the crazy bitch
I talked to last night on the phone?

311
00:27:39,135 --> 00:27:41,215
Sometimes I hear things, too.

312
00:27:41,295 --> 00:27:43,536
Okay, lady, you know what?

313
00:27:44,215 --> 00:27:45,895
You're next.

314
00:27:45,975 --> 00:27:47,420
I'm gonna be right back.

315
00:27:47,815 --> 00:27:48,815
Jesus!

316
00:27:48,895 --> 00:27:50,784
Fucking cuckoo's nest.

317
00:27:51,815 --> 00:27:52,862
Bye.

318
00:28:31,295 --> 00:28:32,740
Hey.

319
00:29:20,295 --> 00:29:21,501
Hey.

320
00:29:42,055 --> 00:29:44,376
Dr. Foley, please report to the front desk.

321
00:29:44,815 --> 00:29:47,819
Dr. Foley, please report to the front desk.

322
00:29:53,175 --> 00:29:54,975
Time to get up, Nica.

323
00:29:55,055 --> 00:29:56,705
It's after 7:00.

324
00:29:59,495 --> 00:30:00,735
Come on!

325
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:24,336
Okay.

326
00:30:24,735 --> 00:30:25,855
Here you go.

327
00:30:25,935 --> 00:30:26,935
Thanks.

328
00:30:27,015 --> 00:30:29,017
I'll get you some water.

329
00:30:37,455 --> 00:30:38,735
Leave it! I...

330
00:30:38,815 --> 00:30:41,935
Sorry. Could I just...
Could I have some privacy, please?

331
00:30:42,015 --> 00:30:44,017
I'd like to get dressed.

332
00:30:45,175 --> 00:30:46,336
Okay.

333
00:31:04,055 --> 00:31:05,386
Code blue!

334
00:31:56,975 --> 00:31:59,296
Mr. Barclay, I'm extremely busy.

335
00:32:00,255 --> 00:32:05,063
We're not running a circus here,
so could you please just get to the point?

336
00:32:12,695 --> 00:32:14,495
That's very clever, Mr. Barclay.

337
00:32:14,575 --> 00:32:16,335
Very convincing.

338
00:32:16,415 --> 00:32:17,655
What? No!

339
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,385
He's alive. Just look at him.

340
00:32:22,615 --> 00:32:24,458
You should get a job in the movies.

341
00:32:25,055 --> 00:32:27,023
I wanna see Nica Pierce.

342
00:32:27,455 --> 00:32:30,061
Could you please show Mr. Barclay out?

343
00:32:32,135 --> 00:32:33,975
I'm telling you, she didn't do it!

344
00:32:34,055 --> 00:32:35,056
Come on. Let's go.

345
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:37,298
Let's watch it again.

346
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,298
That one just never gets old.

347
00:32:39,735 --> 00:32:41,895
Do me a favor, Chucky.

348
00:32:41,975 --> 00:32:43,415
Keep your fucking mouth shut.

349
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:45,259
You know what, Andy?

350
00:32:45,975 --> 00:32:49,821
What if you really are crazy?

351
00:32:50,815 --> 00:32:53,056
Have you ever thought of that?

352
00:32:53,495 --> 00:32:56,578
Maybe you belong
in the booby hatch with Nica.

353
00:32:56,895 --> 00:33:00,741
Maybe this really is just all in your head.

354
00:33:07,135 --> 00:33:08,575
Nica, it wasn't your fault.

355
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:09,855
Bullshit.

356
00:33:09,935 --> 00:33:11,095
Claire, please.

357
00:33:11,175 --> 00:33:14,255
I took care of that woman
for the past five years.

358
00:33:14,335 --> 00:33:16,615
I washed her hair. I wiped her ass.

359
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:19,301
I listened to her crazy
until 3:00 in the morning.

360
00:33:20,175 --> 00:33:21,859
She was my friend.

361
00:33:22,855 --> 00:33:25,615
If she was thinking about
killing herself, I'd have known it.

362
00:33:25,695 --> 00:33:26,775
Not necessarily.

363
00:33:26,855 --> 00:33:28,095
Nica did it!

364
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:30,935
She left her fucking calling card
in Angela's blood!

365
00:33:31,015 --> 00:33:33,415
- Angela did that.
- Why would she do that?

366
00:33:33,495 --> 00:33:34,655
Excuse me.

367
00:33:34,735 --> 00:33:36,735
Aren't we overlooking one other possibility?

368
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:38,415
No, I don't think we are.

369
00:33:38,495 --> 00:33:40,255
Claire, don't you ever
get tired of being wrong?

370
00:33:40,335 --> 00:33:41,780
No, I do not!

371
00:33:42,815 --> 00:33:43,975
Occam's razor.

372
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:47,264
The simplest explanation
is usually the right one.

373
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:49,742
Chucky did it.

374
00:33:50,935 --> 00:33:52,505
I'm so sorry we're late.

375
00:33:53,095 --> 00:33:55,257
I can't believe they're digging
Angela's grave already.

376
00:34:01,655 --> 00:34:02,895
Wait a minute, there's two of them?

377
00:34:03,895 --> 00:34:05,575
What an ugly doll.

378
00:34:05,655 --> 00:34:10,975
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?

379
00:34:11,055 --> 00:34:12,295
Where the hell did he come from?

380
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:13,495
From Alice.

381
00:34:13,575 --> 00:34:15,215
From her guardian.

382
00:34:15,295 --> 00:34:16,895
What did that woman say her name was?

383
00:34:16,975 --> 00:34:17,976
Valentine.

384
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,340
Oh, my God.

385
00:34:23,535 --> 00:34:25,219
Tiffany Valentine.

386
00:34:25,455 --> 00:34:27,735
That was Charles Lee Ray's girlfriend.

387
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,738
- Charles Lee Ray?
- Who is that?

388
00:34:29,855 --> 00:34:32,455
He was a serial killer in the '80s.

389
00:34:32,535 --> 00:34:36,095
He murdered 22 people before
they shot him in a toy store.

390
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:38,826
He died right next to a Good Guy doll.

391
00:34:40,255 --> 00:34:42,375
Charles Lee Ray's nickname was "Chucky."

392
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,510
Please tell me that you
are not gonna let her

393
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,175
dominate the group with this crap.

394
00:34:46,255 --> 00:34:48,178
Nica, it's just a doll.

395
00:34:49,095 --> 00:34:51,223
- Then prove it.
- What?

396
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:54,898
Right here to everybody in this room,
prove that it's just a doll.

397
00:35:01,735 --> 00:35:02,896
All right.

398
00:35:41,575 --> 00:35:44,306
- Not yet.
- Oh, this is ridiculous.

399
00:36:22,175 --> 00:36:23,615
- Wait a minute, now him.
- Nica.

400
00:36:23,695 --> 00:36:25,455
He could've switched places with it somehow.

401
00:36:25,535 --> 00:36:26,775
You leave my baby alone.

402
00:36:26,855 --> 00:36:27,936
Maddy.

403
00:36:28,055 --> 00:36:29,181
Wait!

404
00:36:32,055 --> 00:36:33,375
What are you doing?

405
00:36:33,455 --> 00:36:35,776
I thought we were way past this.

406
00:36:42,935 --> 00:36:45,056
- I was wrong.
- Yeah, about him.

407
00:36:45,855 --> 00:36:47,975
But what about the other one?

408
00:36:48,055 --> 00:36:50,535
Let's just go and get rid of him. Okay?

409
00:36:50,615 --> 00:36:52,743
Better safe than sorry, that's what I say.

410
00:36:56,575 --> 00:36:58,975
So why didn't he kill you
when he had the chance?

411
00:36:59,055 --> 00:37:00,855
Because he's fucking with me.

412
00:37:00,935 --> 00:37:02,744
That's what he does.

413
00:37:03,255 --> 00:37:07,255
First, he'll kill each and every one of you
in the most horrible ways you can imagine.

414
00:37:07,335 --> 00:37:09,303
And he'll make me watch.

415
00:37:09,695 --> 00:37:11,815
And then he'll kill me, too.

416
00:37:11,895 --> 00:37:14,335
Unless, of course,
I'm a complete psychopath.

417
00:37:14,415 --> 00:37:15,655
Well, let's just stay positive.

418
00:37:16,695 --> 00:37:18,060
Madeleine!

419
00:37:28,735 --> 00:37:30,055
Where's Madeleine going?

420
00:37:30,135 --> 00:37:32,015
She took her baby out for a walk.

421
00:37:32,095 --> 00:37:33,381
And I think you should leave her alone.

422
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:38,855
You have to go get her.

423
00:37:38,935 --> 00:37:39,975
No, I can't.

424
00:37:40,055 --> 00:37:41,295
Why not?

425
00:37:41,775 --> 00:37:44,375
My outdoor privileges were suspended.

426
00:37:44,455 --> 00:37:45,855
I hacked into Dr. Foley's computer.

427
00:37:45,935 --> 00:37:48,017
It was ridiculously easy,

428
00:37:48,135 --> 00:37:51,264
a lot easier than being CEO
of a $200 billion corporation.

429
00:37:54,615 --> 00:37:56,219
You're Mark Zuckerberg now.

430
00:37:56,735 --> 00:37:57,736
Yeah.

431
00:37:59,215 --> 00:38:00,296
Okay.

432
00:38:01,935 --> 00:38:03,141
I'll take care of Ashley.

433
00:38:05,535 --> 00:38:08,778
Okay, fine, but, for the record,
I think this is a bad idea.

434
00:38:13,295 --> 00:38:14,660
I'm sorry.

435
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:18,615
Can you help me with this?
I'm not used to this chair.

436
00:38:18,695 --> 00:38:20,185
- Sure.
- Thanks.

437
00:38:21,095 --> 00:38:23,985
It's just right over here.
I think there's something stuck.

438
00:38:28,615 --> 00:38:29,616
Yeah, it's right in here.

439
00:38:29,735 --> 00:38:30,736
Okay.

440
00:38:48,855 --> 00:38:50,505
Ow!

441
00:38:52,135 --> 00:38:54,175
- Claire?
- Holy shit.

442
00:38:54,255 --> 00:38:55,535
What are you doing?

443
00:38:55,615 --> 00:38:57,379
Dr. Foley, it's true.

444
00:38:57,855 --> 00:38:59,186
He's alive.

445
00:39:00,535 --> 00:39:02,537
What have you done to yourself now?

446
00:39:03,895 --> 00:39:06,944
What? No! It was him!

447
00:39:07,535 --> 00:39:09,615
Claire, why don't you come with us?

448
00:39:09,695 --> 00:39:10,935
- Come on.
- No.

449
00:39:11,535 --> 00:39:13,503
No, it was him. It was him!

450
00:39:13,695 --> 00:39:15,140
Claire.

451
00:39:17,215 --> 00:39:18,415
No! No! No!

452
00:39:18,495 --> 00:39:19,615
Stop!

453
00:39:19,695 --> 00:39:21,335
No! Let me go!

454
00:39:21,415 --> 00:39:24,658
No! Let me fucking go! No!

455
00:40:12,855 --> 00:40:16,064
Maddy! Madeleine!

456
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:45,975
No!

457
00:40:46,055 --> 00:40:48,815
No! No! No!

458
00:40:48,895 --> 00:40:51,135
No! Please, don't leave me here!

459
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:52,735
- Got her!
- No!

460
00:40:52,815 --> 00:40:55,386
No, please!

461
00:40:57,295 --> 00:40:58,660
Dr. Foley!

462
00:40:59,575 --> 00:41:01,215
Dr. Foley!

463
00:41:01,295 --> 00:41:03,024
Just relax, Claire.

464
00:41:03,575 --> 00:41:06,415
I swear. I'm over... I won't hurt myself.

465
00:41:06,495 --> 00:41:07,701
I swear.

466
00:41:08,535 --> 00:41:09,536
No!

467
00:41:11,495 --> 00:41:12,576
Okay.

468
00:41:14,015 --> 00:41:15,460
You fuckers!

469
00:41:15,975 --> 00:41:18,455
You blood fucking morons!

470
00:41:18,535 --> 00:41:19,815
Listen to me!

471
00:41:19,895 --> 00:41:21,579
He'll kill us all!

472
00:41:27,135 --> 00:41:28,215
What did you give her?

473
00:41:28,295 --> 00:41:30,095
Ten CCs of Methohexital.

474
00:41:30,175 --> 00:41:32,177
Just enough to relax her.

475
00:41:32,455 --> 00:41:35,538
She's conscious, but she
just won't be able to move.

476
00:41:35,655 --> 00:41:36,855
Have you ever seen her like this?

477
00:41:36,935 --> 00:41:38,505
No. Never.

478
00:41:38,615 --> 00:41:42,335
It's, uh, disturbing,
but it's fascinating to see

479
00:41:42,415 --> 00:41:45,021
this kind of mass hysteria in action.

480
00:41:45,335 --> 00:41:47,258
It's quite sad, really.

481
00:41:48,095 --> 00:41:49,535
Hey, how's Jake?

482
00:41:49,615 --> 00:41:50,775
He's hanging in there, thanks.

483
00:41:50,855 --> 00:41:52,615
Don't you guys have an
anniversary coming up?

484
00:41:52,695 --> 00:41:53,695
Yeah.

485
00:41:53,735 --> 00:41:55,578
Finally taking him to meet my parents.

486
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,856
It's Malcolm.

487
00:42:03,015 --> 00:42:05,015
- I'm gonna need some help.
- Oh, God.

488
00:42:05,095 --> 00:42:07,701
Just... Just relax, Claire.
I'll be back in a bit.

489
00:43:33,295 --> 00:43:34,296
No.

490
00:43:46,095 --> 00:43:47,699
Ah!

491
00:43:52,695 --> 00:43:54,663
"Compressed."

492
00:43:55,495 --> 00:43:57,463
Does that mean what I think it means?

493
00:44:00,735 --> 00:44:02,817
Seriously, I'm not sure.

494
00:44:20,495 --> 00:44:21,496
No.

495
00:44:53,455 --> 00:44:55,537
Sometimes, I scare myself.

496
00:45:38,095 --> 00:45:39,585
What the fuck?

497
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,582
You thought I was the only one?

498
00:45:47,935 --> 00:45:50,575
Wait! What are you doing?

499
00:45:50,655 --> 00:45:51,941
What's going on?

500
00:46:02,135 --> 00:46:03,375
Chucky did it.

501
00:46:03,855 --> 00:46:05,495
It was an accident, Nica.

502
00:46:05,575 --> 00:46:07,464
He killed Angela, too.

503
00:46:07,735 --> 00:46:09,735
I'm gonna pretend you didn't just say that.

504
00:46:09,815 --> 00:46:11,575
And Madeleine, he's manipulating her.

505
00:46:11,655 --> 00:46:12,895
She's delusional, Nica.

506
00:46:13,015 --> 00:46:15,575
She's projecting onto the doll,
just like you are.

507
00:46:15,655 --> 00:46:17,935
I'm going to prove it, Dr. Foley.

508
00:46:18,015 --> 00:46:19,904
And you know what else?

509
00:46:21,175 --> 00:46:23,542
I think both dolls are alive somehow.

510
00:46:23,815 --> 00:46:25,340
Ade beaucoup Damballa.

511
00:46:28,655 --> 00:46:30,135
I know how crazy that sounds.

512
00:46:30,215 --> 00:46:32,786
No crazier than a single doll, Nica.

513
00:46:33,175 --> 00:46:35,495
Please tell me you understand that.

514
00:46:35,575 --> 00:46:37,304
What happened to the other one?

515
00:46:37,415 --> 00:46:39,702
Someone took it, and we'll find it.

516
00:46:40,455 --> 00:46:42,415
Who knows, maybe in your room.

517
00:46:42,495 --> 00:46:43,775
You think it was me now?

518
00:46:43,855 --> 00:46:47,499
To tell you the truth, Nica, at this point,
I honestly don't know what to think.

519
00:46:48,695 --> 00:46:50,823
I'm not a killer, Dr. Foley.

520
00:46:53,055 --> 00:46:55,296
And I'm not fucking crazy.

521
00:46:58,095 --> 00:47:00,975
Nica, I want you to do something for me.

522
00:47:01,055 --> 00:47:02,659
I wanna hypnotize you.

523
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:05,975
Hypnotizing me is not gonna
make a difference.

524
00:47:06,055 --> 00:47:08,501
It's been very useful in the past.

525
00:47:08,935 --> 00:47:10,855
And it might set our minds at ease.

526
00:47:10,935 --> 00:47:12,903
We might find out what really happened.

527
00:47:14,895 --> 00:47:17,819
Nica, I don't wanna have
to send you back to Lochmoor.

528
00:47:26,495 --> 00:47:29,066
Hypnosis helped you accept the truth.

529
00:47:31,655 --> 00:47:35,262
Now, are you afraid of the truth?

530
00:47:36,175 --> 00:47:37,256
Terrified.

531
00:47:37,975 --> 00:47:39,386
And you should be, too.

532
00:47:59,935 --> 00:48:02,063
Keep your eyes on the light, Nica.

533
00:48:13,215 --> 00:48:14,944
All right, Nica, how do you feel?

534
00:48:16,735 --> 00:48:17,735
Receptive.

535
00:48:17,815 --> 00:48:19,738
As always, that's good.

536
00:48:30,455 --> 00:48:33,895
What if I were to tell you
there are cameras at Harrogate,

537
00:48:33,975 --> 00:48:38,822
hidden cameras, everywhere,
and your every move has been recorded?

538
00:48:39,975 --> 00:48:41,055
What if I were to tell you, Nica,

539
00:48:41,135 --> 00:48:44,735
there are recordings of you
killing both Angela and Claire?

540
00:48:44,815 --> 00:48:46,146
What would you say to that?

541
00:48:48,935 --> 00:48:52,144
Well, I couldn't really argue
with evidence like that.

542
00:48:56,175 --> 00:48:59,657
You can picture yourself
killing them, can't you, Nica?

543
00:49:02,855 --> 00:49:04,016
Yes.

544
00:49:06,975 --> 00:49:10,263
Now, what if that evidence
then somehow got erased?

545
00:49:11,895 --> 00:49:14,501
Who would wanna do that, do you think?

546
00:49:14,855 --> 00:49:16,016
Me

547
00:49:16,895 --> 00:49:18,704
would be my first guess.

548
00:49:19,055 --> 00:49:20,295
I agree.

549
00:49:20,855 --> 00:49:25,304
So we're in agreement about
the murders and the tapes

550
00:49:26,055 --> 00:49:28,057
and your terrible guilt.

551
00:49:30,655 --> 00:49:31,861
Yes.

552
00:49:36,175 --> 00:49:37,540
What is it?

553
00:49:39,055 --> 00:49:40,216
Chucky.

554
00:49:41,695 --> 00:49:43,185
He's right behind you.

555
00:49:59,335 --> 00:50:02,179
I've missed these little sessions of ours.

556
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:03,820
Haven't you?

557
00:50:05,175 --> 00:50:06,222
No.

558
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:14,855
No, of course not.

559
00:50:16,535 --> 00:50:18,503
You can't remember them.

560
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,664
Probably for the best.

561
00:50:26,415 --> 00:50:27,735
Holy shit!

562
00:50:28,935 --> 00:50:30,744
And they call me sick?

563
00:50:31,015 --> 00:50:34,224
This guy is... Is... Is diabolical!

564
00:50:34,655 --> 00:50:37,022
I mean, what a piece of work.

565
00:50:38,415 --> 00:50:40,258
I'm actually a little envious.

566
00:50:46,855 --> 00:50:49,506
You know you want to.

567
00:50:50,535 --> 00:50:51,616
Don't you?

568
00:50:52,855 --> 00:50:53,856
Yes.

569
00:50:54,295 --> 00:50:55,785
Come on, Nica.

570
00:50:56,455 --> 00:50:59,538
Time to join the club.

571
00:51:39,535 --> 00:51:41,299
Auntie Nica.

572
00:51:42,855 --> 00:51:44,220
Alice?

573
00:51:44,975 --> 00:51:47,103
We've been waiting for you.

574
00:53:03,415 --> 00:53:06,658
Dr. Foley always says
late people are rude people.

575
00:53:08,415 --> 00:53:10,304
This is so unlike him.

576
00:53:11,975 --> 00:53:13,704
The late Dr. Foley.

577
00:53:14,695 --> 00:53:17,904
Now that has a nice ring to it,
doesn't it, Nica?

578
00:53:18,935 --> 00:53:21,779
I sure hope nothing's happened to him now.

579
00:53:22,575 --> 00:53:25,815
It just kind of makes you wonder who's next.

580
00:53:25,895 --> 00:53:27,056
Doesn't it?

581
00:53:28,095 --> 00:53:29,695
What is wrong with you, Mark?

582
00:53:29,775 --> 00:53:31,504
That's not my name.

583
00:53:32,335 --> 00:53:34,099
Fine, what the hell is your name today?

584
00:53:36,575 --> 00:53:37,701
It's Charles.

585
00:53:38,935 --> 00:53:40,664
I think we've met.

586
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:54,224
Madeleine?

587
00:53:55,055 --> 00:53:56,580
Can I hold him?

588
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:04,695
I better put him down.

589
00:54:04,775 --> 00:54:06,425
He's getting a little cranky.

590
00:54:09,815 --> 00:54:11,180
Madeleine.

591
00:54:14,575 --> 00:54:15,781
Dr. Foley.

592
00:54:16,415 --> 00:54:17,541
You're okay.

593
00:54:17,815 --> 00:54:19,977
I have a hell of a headache.

594
00:54:20,335 --> 00:54:21,496
Don't you remember?

595
00:54:22,535 --> 00:54:26,506
I remember you hypnotized me, and then...

596
00:54:27,615 --> 00:54:29,265
The rest is kind of a blur.

597
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,979
You assaulted me, Nica.

598
00:54:40,095 --> 00:54:41,506
He isn't real.

599
00:54:43,295 --> 00:54:44,975
It was you.

600
00:54:45,055 --> 00:54:47,581
I am very concerned by this setback,

601
00:54:49,015 --> 00:54:52,462
but I am willing to keep
my mouth shut about this incident

602
00:54:53,935 --> 00:54:55,505
if you are.

603
00:55:07,215 --> 00:55:08,626
Oh, God.

604
00:55:21,415 --> 00:55:22,575
Hello?

605
00:55:22,655 --> 00:55:24,135
Hello, Andy.

606
00:55:24,215 --> 00:55:25,626
Who is this?

607
00:55:26,215 --> 00:55:27,455
Tiffany.

608
00:55:27,975 --> 00:55:29,375
Jennifer.

609
00:55:29,455 --> 00:55:31,015
Even I lose track.

610
00:55:31,095 --> 00:55:32,859
I know who you are.

611
00:55:33,415 --> 00:55:34,975
I'm coming for you.

612
00:55:35,055 --> 00:55:36,420
And for him.

613
00:55:36,535 --> 00:55:38,975
Actually, there's three of us at the moment,

614
00:55:39,055 --> 00:55:42,184
and the cult is growing all the time.

615
00:55:42,495 --> 00:55:45,578
Hey, Andy, you wanna join up?

616
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:47,375
Fuck you.

617
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:49,575
Oh, I have a message from Chucky.

618
00:55:49,655 --> 00:55:52,420
He said you'll know what it means.

619
00:55:52,895 --> 00:55:54,897
It's just a single word.

620
00:55:55,615 --> 00:55:59,135
He said, "Disembowel."

621
00:55:59,215 --> 00:56:02,059
Now, what do you suppose that means, Andy?

622
00:56:59,295 --> 00:57:00,660
Madeleine?

623
00:57:08,815 --> 00:57:09,941
Madeleine!

624
00:57:22,295 --> 00:57:23,935
I never stopped loving you.

625
00:57:24,015 --> 00:57:25,824
I'm your friend to the end.

626
00:57:28,975 --> 00:57:32,502
You know, Chucky,
a boy's best friend is his mother.

627
00:57:35,855 --> 00:57:37,095
Wanna play?

628
00:58:10,255 --> 00:58:11,256
Madeleine!

629
00:58:12,935 --> 00:58:14,539
Madeleine, what have you done?

630
00:58:16,895 --> 00:58:17,895
What?

631
00:58:17,975 --> 00:58:20,455
What have you done to your baby, Madeleine?

632
00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:23,503
It's not a baby, it's just a doll.

633
00:58:24,495 --> 00:58:25,826
Your baby.

634
00:58:26,855 --> 00:58:28,061
Joshua.

635
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,975
Remember?

636
00:58:31,735 --> 00:58:34,181
What did you do to him, Madeleine?

637
00:58:36,815 --> 00:58:37,896
Say it.

638
00:58:41,095 --> 00:58:42,426
I'm sorry.

639
00:58:43,415 --> 00:58:45,375
I'm so, so sorry.

640
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:47,264
Not to me, Madeleine.

641
00:58:47,735 --> 00:58:49,100
Say it to him.

642
00:59:00,895 --> 00:59:03,705
My sweet angel, can you ever forgive me?

643
00:59:12,495 --> 00:59:14,577
He just wouldn't stop crying.

644
00:59:15,415 --> 00:59:18,495
No matter what I did,
I couldn't make him stop.

645
00:59:18,575 --> 00:59:22,625
The sound was like a sharp piece
of glass drilling into my head.

646
00:59:24,575 --> 00:59:26,464
I was a terrible mother.

647
00:59:26,975 --> 00:59:29,295
I could never make him happy.

648
00:59:29,375 --> 00:59:30,575
You didn't kill him.

649
00:59:30,655 --> 00:59:32,895
- What?
- Nica, please.

650
00:59:32,975 --> 00:59:34,340
He's just pretending.

651
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:37,297
- Leave him alone!
- He's alive!

652
00:59:37,895 --> 00:59:39,135
I like to be hugged.

653
00:59:43,295 --> 00:59:45,775
More than anything, I wish that he was.

654
00:59:47,815 --> 00:59:50,261
Wishing won't bring him back.
I know that now.

655
00:59:58,975 --> 01:00:01,546
Come on.

656
01:00:08,295 --> 01:00:09,342
It's a doll.

657
01:00:10,615 --> 01:00:16,179
And it's a powerful symbol
of your guilt, Malcolm's confusion,

658
01:00:16,495 --> 01:00:18,941
...and the past.

659
01:00:21,175 --> 01:00:25,863
Now, don't you think it's time
to bury the past once and for all?

660
01:00:27,295 --> 01:00:30,775
In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection unto eternal life

661
01:00:30,855 --> 01:00:33,215
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

662
01:00:33,295 --> 01:00:36,855
we commend unto Almighty God our loved ones,

663
01:00:36,935 --> 01:00:39,142
and we commit their bodies to the ground.

664
01:00:40,855 --> 01:00:44,860
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

665
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:50,902
May the Lord bless them and keep them
and shine His light down upon them

666
01:00:51,015 --> 01:00:54,224
and be gracious unto them
and give them peace.

667
01:00:55,535 --> 01:00:56,661
Amen.

668
01:01:12,975 --> 01:01:15,216
You're not buying it, are you?

669
01:01:15,855 --> 01:01:16,936
Nope.

670
01:01:17,575 --> 01:01:18,906
He'll be back.

671
01:01:19,695 --> 01:01:21,504
He always comes back.

672
01:01:38,015 --> 01:01:41,622
Visiting hours are over, sir.
Gonna have to ask you to turn around.

673
01:01:41,735 --> 01:01:45,015
I need to see Dr. Foley,
or Nica Pierce, right away.

674
01:01:45,095 --> 01:01:46,594
Well, you can call
and make an appointment.

675
01:01:46,624 --> 01:01:47,695
No, this is an emergency.

676
01:01:47,775 --> 01:01:52,175
I bet, but now, please, just get back in
your car and turn it around, all right?

677
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,780
Okay, then I wanna commit myself.

678
01:01:54,655 --> 01:01:57,495
Get the hell out of here! Right now!

679
01:02:54,335 --> 01:02:55,621
Night-night.

680
01:03:04,135 --> 01:03:05,864
This just came for you, Dr. Foley.

681
01:03:07,015 --> 01:03:08,015
Who's it from?

682
01:03:08,095 --> 01:03:09,176
Doesn't say.

683
01:03:25,295 --> 01:03:27,218
What happened to his hair?

684
01:03:27,335 --> 01:03:29,542
Why would anyone send this to me?

685
01:03:30,175 --> 01:03:33,335
You know, we've got way more important
things to worry about right now.

686
01:03:33,415 --> 01:03:34,655
- Let's get on our rounds.
- Yeah.

687
01:04:23,655 --> 01:04:25,145
No shoelaces.

688
01:04:26,135 --> 01:04:28,263
It's all I have left of him.

689
01:04:32,495 --> 01:04:34,896
Dr. Foley put you on suicide watch.

690
01:04:36,135 --> 01:04:38,502
You know, I'd do it if I thought
I could see him again.

691
01:04:42,015 --> 01:04:44,143
But suicides don't go to heaven, do they?

692
01:04:45,415 --> 01:04:47,383
I don't know, Madeleine.

693
01:04:57,775 --> 01:04:59,975
I just know I have two children of my own,

694
01:05:00,055 --> 01:05:02,575
and I'd do anything to keep them safe.

695
01:05:02,655 --> 01:05:07,024
Would you kill for them
if it was for their own good?

696
01:05:08,295 --> 01:05:10,662
Do you love them that much?

697
01:05:10,975 --> 01:05:13,455
Nurse Ashley, please report
to the nurses' station.

698
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:17,385
I'll be checking on you every 15 minutes.

699
01:05:25,495 --> 01:05:26,735
Hi, baby.

700
01:05:34,375 --> 01:05:37,140
They just don't get us.

701
01:05:38,415 --> 01:05:39,815
And they never will.

702
01:05:39,895 --> 01:05:42,262
A mother's love never dies.

703
01:05:42,775 --> 01:05:45,381
Not even when she kills it.

704
01:05:46,855 --> 01:05:48,345
Now, please,

705
01:05:49,335 --> 01:05:51,224
one last time,

706
01:05:53,735 --> 01:05:55,260
come to Mommy.

707
01:06:16,855 --> 01:06:18,016
Will it hurt?

708
01:06:18,735 --> 01:06:20,419
I'll do my best.

709
01:07:18,895 --> 01:07:19,976
Ah!

710
01:08:19,655 --> 01:08:22,135
Well, you're having a bad day,
aren't you, Doc?

711
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:25,298
Ashley, put him to bed.

712
01:08:26,775 --> 01:08:29,858
Dr. Foley, I don't think
I can do this anymore.

713
01:08:31,495 --> 01:08:33,497
- What?
- It's too much.

714
01:08:35,015 --> 01:08:36,346
I'm sorry.

715
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:42,339
Go to bed, Malcolm.

716
01:08:46,175 --> 01:08:47,336
Sure.

717
01:08:49,255 --> 01:08:50,780
Get rid of it.

718
01:08:55,615 --> 01:08:56,855
Yes, sir.

719
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,501
Nica?

720
01:09:40,255 --> 01:09:42,257
How did you get in here?

721
01:09:42,815 --> 01:09:44,375
Take a fucking guess.

722
01:09:44,455 --> 01:09:47,664
If this is a joke,
this is not a good day for it.

723
01:09:52,095 --> 01:09:53,585
It was Chucky.

724
01:10:03,535 --> 01:10:06,220
Why do I always fall for the crazy ones?

725
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,695
Madeleine's dead.

726
01:10:26,775 --> 01:10:27,935
Chucky did it.

727
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:29,375
No.

728
01:10:29,455 --> 01:10:31,184
She killed herself.

729
01:10:32,735 --> 01:10:34,897
She dug him up and mutilated herself

730
01:10:35,055 --> 01:10:37,215
so it looked like Chucky did it.

731
01:10:37,295 --> 01:10:38,335
No.

732
01:10:38,415 --> 01:10:40,615
Unless you killed them all, Nica.

733
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:43,095
You know, it doesn't really matter to me

734
01:10:43,175 --> 01:10:45,826
because, either way,
it's gonna make a hell of a book.

735
01:10:47,415 --> 01:10:50,895
But now, you're gonna have
to go back to Lochmoor.

736
01:10:50,975 --> 01:10:56,698
It's too bad, because here,
I could've given you

737
01:10:58,135 --> 01:11:00,855
so much more personal attention.

738
01:11:00,935 --> 01:11:02,937
He's gonna kill you, too.

739
01:11:43,535 --> 01:11:44,775
You're gonna die,

740
01:11:46,615 --> 01:11:48,902
and I'm gonna tell everybody about you.

741
01:11:55,055 --> 01:11:57,865
You're a diagnosed schizophrenic

742
01:11:57,975 --> 01:12:02,264
and a murderess of five people,
that we know of.

743
01:12:07,655 --> 01:12:10,386
No one's going to listen to you.

744
01:12:15,655 --> 01:12:18,386
I just can't with this guy!

745
01:12:18,895 --> 01:12:21,815
I don't know whether to kill him
or just take notes.

746
01:12:25,735 --> 01:12:28,102
Now, we're gonna try this again.

747
01:12:31,015 --> 01:12:32,346
I'm not a killer.

748
01:12:32,775 --> 01:12:34,539
Not yet.

749
01:12:49,655 --> 01:12:51,225
Oh, my God.

750
01:12:52,095 --> 01:12:53,426
He's here.

751
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:55,375
Took him long enough.

752
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:56,615
Stupid kid.

753
01:12:56,695 --> 01:12:58,695
Andy's not a kid anymore.

754
01:12:58,775 --> 01:13:00,015
So what's your point?

755
01:13:00,095 --> 01:13:02,496
I'm just saying, it behooves us
to watch our step.

756
01:13:03,295 --> 01:13:05,616
"Behooves." Listen to you.

757
01:13:05,855 --> 01:13:08,062
You sound like Hannibal Lecter.

758
01:13:08,335 --> 01:13:11,020
Can't believe they canceled that show.

759
01:13:14,375 --> 01:13:15,815
Where'd he come from?

760
01:13:15,895 --> 01:13:17,101
Who cares? Wake him up.

761
01:13:17,895 --> 01:13:20,466
Ade beaucoup Damballa.

762
01:13:21,055 --> 01:13:23,376
Give me the power, I beg of you!

763
01:13:30,975 --> 01:13:33,865
What the hell happened to you?

764
01:13:34,655 --> 01:13:35,816
Oh.

765
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:41,975
You know, I love being me.

766
01:13:42,055 --> 01:13:43,975
And I love my job.

767
01:13:44,055 --> 01:13:47,335
Especially the look on my victim's face

768
01:13:47,415 --> 01:13:50,180
when they realize, in that final moment,

769
01:13:50,295 --> 01:13:52,695
that it's all really happening.

770
01:13:52,775 --> 01:13:56,975
A children's toy is actually
beating them to death with a yardstick!

771
01:13:57,055 --> 01:13:58,375
Or setting them on fire.

772
01:13:58,455 --> 01:13:59,655
Eviscerating them.

773
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:01,817
All actual examples.

774
01:14:02,535 --> 01:14:05,495
A few years ago, I came across
this groovy new spell

775
01:14:05,575 --> 01:14:08,897
on VoodooForDummies.com
that changed everything.

776
01:14:09,175 --> 01:14:10,895
Now, I can be me.

777
01:14:10,975 --> 01:14:12,855
- And me.
- And me.

778
01:14:12,935 --> 01:14:16,055
And theoretically, anyone or anything

779
01:14:16,135 --> 01:14:18,263
with two legs and a hand for stabbing.

780
01:14:19,135 --> 01:14:20,660
Like Alice.

781
01:14:22,175 --> 01:14:24,255
It was fun for a while.

782
01:14:24,335 --> 01:14:28,465
People trust cute little girls
almost as much as cute little dolls,

783
01:14:28,895 --> 01:14:33,059
but little girls can get hurt
when their victims try to fight back.

784
01:14:34,455 --> 01:14:36,184
Then they ain't so cute anymore.

785
01:14:49,295 --> 01:14:50,376
Run!

786
01:14:57,935 --> 01:14:59,504
No.

787
01:15:07,655 --> 01:15:08,656
No!

788
01:15:29,455 --> 01:15:31,935
He made the funniest
face when I drilled him!

789
01:15:32,015 --> 01:15:34,575
Did you see the steam
when I sliced open his guts?

790
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:36,455
I've never felt so alive!

791
01:15:36,535 --> 01:15:39,255
Yeah, well, you've been alive
for, like, two minutes.

792
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:43,020
Welcome to the cult, pal.

793
01:15:43,135 --> 01:15:45,706
- Thanks. You guys are the best.
- Right.

794
01:15:45,935 --> 01:15:47,495
Now, I'm gonna go kill Andy.

795
01:15:47,575 --> 01:15:50,021
No, I wanna kill Andy. I earned it.

796
01:15:50,135 --> 01:15:51,815
I've been through a lot today.

797
01:15:51,895 --> 01:15:54,815
You got to suck titty today.
Look what happened to me.

798
01:15:54,895 --> 01:15:56,975
Hello? Look at my hair.

799
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:58,102
Oh, shit. You win.

800
01:15:58,215 --> 01:16:01,059
Absolutely. Sorry, pal.
You go fuck him up real good.

801
01:16:01,175 --> 01:16:02,415
Have fun.

802
01:16:03,415 --> 01:16:04,985
You, guard the door.

803
01:16:05,095 --> 01:16:06,938
Kill anyone that tries to get in.

804
01:16:07,055 --> 01:16:08,216
Right.

805
01:16:10,655 --> 01:16:13,056
I'll take care of her.

806
01:17:01,935 --> 01:17:03,539
Cherry snow cone.

807
01:17:04,455 --> 01:17:05,866
Ah.

808
01:17:07,295 --> 01:17:08,456
Yummy.

809
01:17:09,255 --> 01:17:11,337
Just fucking do it already.

810
01:17:11,935 --> 01:17:13,585
Get it over with.

811
01:17:14,015 --> 01:17:17,940
If I wanted you dead,
you'd be tits-up by now.

812
01:17:18,495 --> 01:17:21,544
I was never gonna kill you, Nica.

813
01:17:22,135 --> 01:17:26,345
Believe me, there's worse things than death.

814
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:35,222
Ade beaucoup Damballa.

815
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:40,781
Give me all the power, I beg of you!

816
01:18:35,055 --> 01:18:37,057
Ah.

817
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:56,215
Hiya, Doc.

818
01:18:57,135 --> 01:18:58,296
Huh?

819
01:19:06,255 --> 01:19:09,384
There's definitely perks to being
supernaturally possessed.

820
01:19:20,775 --> 01:19:22,379
This is for Nica.

821
01:19:31,255 --> 01:19:32,461
Ah!

822
01:19:58,775 --> 01:20:00,061
I did it.

823
01:20:01,815 --> 01:20:03,260
I killed her.

824
01:20:09,455 --> 01:20:11,981
I gave that bitch what she deserved.

825
01:20:13,735 --> 01:20:14,896
No, you didn't.

826
01:20:17,335 --> 01:20:18,780
I killed her.

827
01:20:19,735 --> 01:20:21,015
'Cause I'm Charles!

828
01:20:21,095 --> 01:20:23,063
In your dreams, asshole.

829
01:20:23,775 --> 01:20:25,220
I'm Charles.

830
01:20:26,175 --> 01:20:28,018
But everybody calls me Chucky.

831
01:20:28,575 --> 01:20:30,020
Nobody calls me that.

832
01:20:34,015 --> 01:20:36,336
No, wait a... wait a minute.

833
01:20:40,095 --> 01:20:41,135
Who am I now?

834
01:20:41,215 --> 01:20:44,059
You're a fucking poser. You're sick.

835
01:20:45,895 --> 01:20:47,385
And not in the fun way like me.

836
01:20:50,655 --> 01:20:51,695
Nica?

837
01:20:51,775 --> 01:20:53,539
Nica's taking a nap.

838
01:20:57,455 --> 01:20:59,378
And I'm gonna make sure she never wakes up.

839
01:21:06,415 --> 01:21:08,622
I just wanna be someone who matters.

840
01:21:10,455 --> 01:21:14,426
But I'm not Mark. I'm not Michael. I'm...

841
01:21:16,095 --> 01:21:17,824
I'm just Malcolm.

842
01:21:18,655 --> 01:21:21,306
Fucking Multiple Malcolm.

843
01:21:21,895 --> 01:21:23,895
Sounds like it's getting
pretty crowded in there.

844
01:21:23,975 --> 01:21:25,055
I can hear him.

845
01:21:25,135 --> 01:21:28,025
I can still hear Chucky inside my head!

846
01:21:43,695 --> 01:21:47,825
And it was such a nice place to visit.

847
01:22:05,615 --> 01:22:06,821
Ah.

848
01:22:16,055 --> 01:22:19,377
Andy Barclay, as I live and breathe.

849
01:22:20,855 --> 01:22:21,856
Ah!

850
01:22:22,015 --> 01:22:23,062
Oh!

851
01:22:27,455 --> 01:22:28,456
Ah!

852
01:22:43,295 --> 01:22:44,342
No!

853
01:22:44,975 --> 01:22:45,976
No!

854
01:22:48,495 --> 01:22:49,826
No!

855
01:22:51,695 --> 01:22:53,459
This is the end, fucker!

856
01:23:19,815 --> 01:23:21,658
You sent me?

857
01:23:22,495 --> 01:23:25,385
Thanks for coming after me.
You saved me the trouble.

858
01:23:25,495 --> 01:23:26,576
Fuck you!

859
01:23:38,975 --> 01:23:40,739
You kill me, you kill her.

860
01:23:42,775 --> 01:23:44,186
Think about it.

861
01:23:45,535 --> 01:23:47,775
Yeah, thinking is for losers.

862
01:23:47,855 --> 01:23:50,495
Lockdown. The facility is now on lockdown.

863
01:23:50,575 --> 01:23:52,295
Patients to your rooms, immediately.

864
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:53,536
Tag, you're it, pal.

865
01:23:57,215 --> 01:23:58,535
No!

866
01:23:58,615 --> 01:24:00,495
Security, west hall.

867
01:24:00,575 --> 01:24:02,942
Security, code one in west hall.

868
01:24:57,775 --> 01:24:59,425
Hey, sweet-face.

869
01:25:00,775 --> 01:25:02,903
Good to see you back on your feet.

870
01:25:04,855 --> 01:25:06,937
You look great, Tiff.

871
01:25:22,455 --> 01:25:23,980
So this is different.

872
01:25:25,215 --> 01:25:26,705
I don't know.

873
01:25:27,095 --> 01:25:28,585
Works for me.

874
01:25:36,975 --> 01:25:38,895
Some things never change, though.

875
01:25:38,975 --> 01:25:42,138
"A true classic never goes out of style."

876
01:25:42,255 --> 01:25:48,137
You said that to me once,
after stabbing a man 39 times.

877
01:25:57,015 --> 01:25:58,016
What?

878
01:25:58,615 --> 01:26:01,346
I was just feeling bad about Alice.

879
01:26:02,215 --> 01:26:06,698
It was kind of nice,
having Alice around, you know?

880
01:26:09,015 --> 01:26:10,744
Nah, fuck that kid.

881
01:30:36,415 --> 01:30:37,462
Kyle?

882
01:30:37,855 --> 01:30:38,856
Andy sent me.

883
01:30:39,455 --> 01:30:40,945
We're gonna have some fun.

884
01:30:43,975 --> 01:30:58,975
