1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:40,000
❤ Watch on kisskh.me 👌

2
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,800
Get up! Get up! 🐼🐼

3
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:20,529
The winner, by total annihilation...
Yama!

4
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,841
Who is next?

5
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,124
Who has the guts to step into
the ring with Little Yama?

6
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,049
Yama!

7
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,608
- Can I try?
- Hmm.

8
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,004
I have a robot.
I built it myself.

9
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,966
Beat it, kid.

10
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,885
House rules.
You gotta pay to play.

11
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,321
Oh, uh, is this enough?

12
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,371
What's your name, little boy?

13
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,168
Hiro. Hiro Hamada.

14
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,968
Prepare your bot, Zero.

15
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,688
Two bots enter, one bot leaves.

16
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,801
Fighters ready?

17
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,161
Fight!

18
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,166
That was my first fight.
I... Can I try again?

19
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,210
No one likes a sore loser,
little boy.

20
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,090
Go home.

21
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,725
I've got more money.

22
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,204
Fighters ready?

23
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,851
Fight!

24
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,122
Mega-bot, destroy.

25
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,361
Huh?

26
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,686
What? Huh?

27
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,491
- No more Little Yama.
- But, wha...

28
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,290
This is not possible!

29
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,088
Hey, I'm as surprised
as you are.

30
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,651
Beginner's luck.

31
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,167
Do you want to go again, Yama?

32
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,122
- No one hustles Yama!
- Whoa. Hey...

33
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,728
Teach him a lesson.

34
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,846
Hey, fellas.
Let's talk about this.

35
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,809
- Hiro! Get on!
- Tadashi!

36
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,441
Oh, good timing!

37
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,641
A-ha!

38
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,681
Oh, mama!

39
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,446
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

40
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,766
- Are you hurt?
- No.

41
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,844
Then what were you thinking,
Knucklehead?

42
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,921
Ow! Ow!

43
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,605
You graduated high school
when you were 13,

44
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,727
and this is what you're doing?

45
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,801
There they are!

46
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,041
Hey!

47
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,363
Hold on!

48
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,603
Whoo-hoo! Yes!

49
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,171
Get back here.

50
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,281
Bot fighting is illegal.

51
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,124
You're going
to get yourself arrested.

52
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,288
Bot fighting is not illegal.

53
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,801
Betting on bot fighting,
that's... that's illegal.

54
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,001
But so lucrative!

55
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,483
I'm on a roll, big brother!
And there is no stopping me!

56
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,520
Oh, no.

57
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,801
Hi, Aunt Cass.

58
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,889
Are you guys okay?
Tell me you're okay.

59
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,486
- We're fine.
- We're okay.

60
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,806
Oh, good.

61
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,849
Then what were you
two knuckleheads thinking?

62
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,401
For 10 years,

63
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,482
I have done the best I could
to raise you.

64
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,371
Have I been perfect? No.

65
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,409
Do I know anything about children? No.

66
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,360
Should I have picked up a book
on parenting?

67
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,686
Probably!

68
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,001
Where was I going with this?
I had a point.

69
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,202
- Sorry.
- We love you, Aunt Cass.

70
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,771
Well, I love you, too!

71
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,000
I had to close up early
because of you two felons.

72
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,162
On beat poetry night.

73
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,925
Stress eating.
Because of you.

74
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,164
Come on, Mochi.

75
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,364
This is really good!

76
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,447
You better make
this up to Aunt Cass

77
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,204
before she eats
everything in the cafe.

78
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,486
For sure.

79
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,360
And I hope you learned
your lesson, bonehead.

80
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,851
Absolutely.

81
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,920
You're going bot fighting,
aren't you?

82
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,961
There's a fight across town.

83
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,240
If I book,
I can still make it.

84
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,086
When are you gonna
start doing something

85
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,605
with that big brain of yours?

86
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,530
What? Go to college like you?

87
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,480
So people can tell me stuff
I already know?

88
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,247
Unbelievable.

89
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,883
Oh, what would Mom and Dad say?

90
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,121
I don't know.

91
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,884
They're gone.

92
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,480
They died when I was three, remember?

93
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,521
Hey!

94
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,962
- I'll take you.
- Really?

95
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,287
I can't stop you from going,

96
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,726
but I'm not going
to let you go on your own.

97
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,007
Sweet.

98
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,728
What are we doing
at your nerd school?

99
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,405
Bot-fight's that way!

100
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,971
Gotta grab something.

101
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,646
Is this gonna take long?

102
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,127
Relax, you big baby.
We'll be in and out.

103
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,771
Anyway,
you've never seen my lab.

104
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,570
Oh, great,
I get to see your nerd lab!

105
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,841
- Heads up!
- Whoa!

106
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,961
Whoa.

107
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,491
Electro-mag suspension?

108
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,801
Hey!

109
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,130
- Who are you?
- Uh, I'm...

110
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,203
Go Go,
this is my brother Hiro.

111
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,843
Welcome to the nerd lab.

112
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,601
Yeah.

113
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,491
I've never seen electro-mag
suspension on a bike before.

114
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,161
Zero resistance, faster bike.

115
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,004
But, not fast enough...

116
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,566
...yet.

117
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,081
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

118
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,003
Do not move.
Behind the line, please.

119
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,802
Hey, Wasabi.
This is my brother Hiro.

120
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,406
Hello, Hiro.
Prepare to be amazed.

121
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,481
Catch.

122
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,527
Wow.

123
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,481
- Laser-induced plasma?
- Oh, yeah.

124
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,564
With a little magnetic confinement

125
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,449
for, uh, ultra-precision.

126
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,649
Wow. How do you find anything
in this mess?

127
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,490
Oh! I have a system.

128
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,768
There's a place for everything,
and everything in its place.

129
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,251
- Need this!
- You can't do that!

130
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,482
This is anarchy!
Society has rules!

131
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,324
Excuse me!

132
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,931
Coming through!

133
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,606
Tadashi!

134
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,730
Oh, my gosh. You must be Hiro!

135
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,884
I've heard so much about you!

136
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,169
Perfect timing.
Perfect timing.

137
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,724
That's a whole lot
of tungsten carbide.

138
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,530
400 pounds of it!

139
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,880
Come here,
come here, come here.

140
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,605
You're going to love this.

141
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,889
A dash of perchloric acid,
a smidge of cobalt,

142
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,561
a hint of hydrogen peroxide,

143
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,200
super-heated to 500 Kelvin,
and...

144
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,682
Ta-da! It's pretty great, huh?

145
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,200
It's so pink.

146
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,124
Here's the best part.

147
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,487
Whoa.

148
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,884
I know, right?

149
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,249
Chemical metal embrittlement.

150
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,885
Not bad, Honey Lemon.

151
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,726
"Honey Lemon"?
"Go Go"? "Wasabi"?

152
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,890
I spill wasabi on my shirt
one time, people.

153
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,406
One time!

154
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,648
Fred is the one who comes up
with the nicknames.

155
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,245
Uh, who's Fred?

156
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,800
This guy, right here!

157
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,487
Ah-ah. Don't be alarmed.
It is just a suit.

158
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,085
This is not
my real face and body.

159
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,327
The name's Fred.

160
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,404
School mascot by day,
but by night...

161
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,485
I am also a school mascot.

162
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,085
So, what's your major?

163
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,640
No, no, no, I'm not a student.

164
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,764
But I am a major science enthusiast.

165
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I've been trying to get
Honey to develop a formula,

166
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,090
that can turn me into a
fire-breathing lizard at will.

167
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,527
But she says that's "not science."

168
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,761
It's really not.

169
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,490
Yeah, and I guess the shrink ray

170
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,444
I asked Wasabi for isn't "science" either.

171
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,647
- Is it?
- Nope.

172
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,485
Well, then, what about
"invisible sandwich"?

173
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,688
- Hiro.
- Imagine eating a sandwich,

174
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,769
but everybody
just thinks you're crazy.

175
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,887
Just stop.

176
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,201
- Laser eyes?
- What?

177
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,124
- Tingly fingers?
- Never gonna happen.

178
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,327
Hey, what about
a growth serum, huh?

179
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,443
So, uh, what have
you been working on?

180
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,761
I'll show you.

181
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,970
Duct tape?

182
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,889
I hate to break it to you, bro.

183
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,166
Already been invented.

184
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,447
Hey!

185
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,721
Oh! Dude!

186
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,801
Ow!

187
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,007
This is what
I've been working on.

188
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,522
Hello. I am Baymax.

189
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,081
Your personal
healthcare companion.

190
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,526
I was alerted to the need

191
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,002
for medical attention
when you said, "Ow."

192
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,322
A robotic nurse.

193
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,322
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how would you rate your pain?

194
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,330
Physical or emotional?

195
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,686
I will scan you now.

196
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,009
Scan complete.

197
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,722
You have a slight epidermal
abrasion on your forearm.

198
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,441
I suggest
an anti-bacterial spray.

199
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,641
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

200
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,085
What's in the spray, specifically?

201
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,204
The primary ingredient is bacitracin.

202
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,526
That's a bummer.

203
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,846
I'm actually allergic to that.

204
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,929
You are not allergic to bacitracin.

205
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,248
You do have a mild allergy to

206
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,521
peanuts.

207
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,210
Hmm. Not bad.

208
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,886
You've done some serious
coding on this thing, huh?

209
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,044
Uh-huh. Programed him with
over 10,000 medical procedures.

210
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,727
This chip is what
makes Baymax, Baymax.

211
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,561
Vinyl?

212
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,809
Yeah, going for a non-threatening,
huggable kind of thing.

213
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,042
Looks like
a walking marshmallow.

214
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,680
- No offense.
- I am a robot.

215
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,041
I cannot be offended.

216
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,247
- Hyperspectral cameras?
- Yep.

217
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,561
Huh.

218
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,721
Hmm.

219
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,960
- Titanium skeleton?
- Carbon fiber.

220
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,288
Right. Even lighter.

221
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,727
Killer actuators.
Where did you get those?

222
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,520
Oh, machined them
right here, in-house.

223
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,926
- Really?
- Yup.

224
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,570
He can lift 1,000 pounds.

225
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,721
Shut up.

226
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,403
You have been a good boy.
Have a lollipop.

227
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,766
Nice.

228
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,325
I cannot deactivate until you say
you are satisfied with your care.

229
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,331
Well then,
I'm satisfied with my care.

230
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,489
He's going to help
a lot of people.

231
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,607
Hey, what kind of battery
does it use?

232
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,761
Lithium ion.

233
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,606
You know, supercapacitors
would charge way faster.

234
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,966
Huh.

235
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,850
Burning the midnight oil,
Mr. Hamada?

236
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,040
Oh, hey, Professor.

237
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,969
Actually,
I was just finishing up.

238
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,360
You must be Hiro.

239
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,931
Bot-fighter, right?

240
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,767
When my daughter was younger,
that's all she wanted to do.

241
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,047
May I?

242
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,486
Uh, sure.

243
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,247
Hmm.

244
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,970
Magnetic-bearing servos.

245
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,326
Pretty sick, huh?

246
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,880
Wanna see how I put 'em together?

247
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,206
Hey. genius!

248
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,169
He invented them.

249
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,647
You're Robert Callaghan?

250
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,329
Like, as in, the
Callaghan-Catmull spline,

252
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,000
and Callaghan's "Laws of Robotics?"

253
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,161
That's right.

254
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,004
Ever think about applying here?

255
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,566
Your age wouldn't be an issue.

256
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,801
Oh, I don't know.

257
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,123
He's pretty serious about
his career in bot-fighting.

258
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,646
Well, kind of serious.

259
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,841
I can see why.

260
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,968
With your bot,
winning must come easy.

261
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,890
Yeah, I guess.

262
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,410
Well, if you like things easy,
then my program isn't for you.

263
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,881
We push the boundaries
of robotics here.

264
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,527
My students go on to shape the future.

265
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,325
Nice to meet you, Hiro.

266
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,931
Good luck with the bot-fights.

267
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,846
We gotta hurry if you
want to catch that bot-fight.

268
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,645
I have to go here.

269
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,330
If I don't go
to this nerd school,

270
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,726
I'm gonna lose my mind.

271
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,126
How do I get in?

272
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,089
Every year, the school has
a student showcase.

273
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,803
You come up with something
that blows Callaghan away, you're in.

274
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,604
But, it's gotta be great.

275
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,001
Trust me.

276
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,211
It will be.

277
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,601
Nothing!

278
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,889
No ideas!
Useless, empty brain!

279
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,203
Wow. Washed up at 14.

280
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,327
So sad.

281
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,211
I got nothing! I'm done.
I'm never getting in.

282
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,205
Hey, I'm not giving up on you.

283
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,246
What are you doing?

284
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,726
Shake things up.

285
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,201
Use that big brain of yours
to think your way out.

286
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,408
- What?
- Look for a new angle.

287
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,281
Huh.

288
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,087
Wow, a lot of
sweet tech here today.

289
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,441
How are you feeling?

290
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,127
You're talking to an ex-bot fighter.
Takes a lot more than this to rattle me.

291
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,322
- Yep, he's nervous.
- Oh.

292
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,766
Oh, you have nothing
to fear, little fellow.

293
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,605
- He's so tense.
- No, I'm not.

294
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,285
Relax, Hiro.

295
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,205
Your tech is amazing.
Tell him, Go Go.

296
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,482
- Stop whining. Woman up.
- I'm fine!

297
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,451
What do you need, little man?
Deodorant? Breath mint?

298
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,601
Fresh pair of underpants?

299
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,689
Underpants?
You need serious help.

300
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,881
Hey, I come prepared.

301
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,009
I haven't done laundry
in six months.

302
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,360
One pair lasts me four days.

303
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,801
I go front, I go back,
I go inside-out.

304
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,644
Then I go front and back.

305
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,042
Wow. That is both
disgusting and awesome.

306
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,406
Don't encourage him.

307
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,971
It's called "recycling."

308
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,731
Next presenter, Hiro Hamada-

309
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,689
Oh, yeah. This is it.

310
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,841
I guess I'm up.

311
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,161
Okay, photo, photo!
Everybody say, "Hiro."

312
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,725
- Hiro!
- Yeah!

313
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,486
We love you, Hiro. Good luck!

314
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,085
- Don't mess it up.
- Break a leg, little man.

315
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,691
Science, yeah!

316
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,008
All right, bro. This is it.

317
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,568
Come on.
Don't leave me hanging.

318
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,640
What's going on?

319
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,207
I really want to go here.

320
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,881
Hey-

321
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,002
You got this.

322
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,682
<i>Uh... Hi.</i>

323
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,163
My name <i>is</i> Hiro...

324
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,806
Sorry.

325
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,641
<i>My name is Hiro Hamada,</i>

326
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,683
<i>and I've been working
on something</i>

327
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,201
<i>that I think is pretty cool.</i>

328
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,204
<i>I hope you like it.</i>

329
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,044
<i>This is a microbot.</i>

330
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,323
Breathe.

331
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,571
<i>It doesn't look like much,</i>

332
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,927
<i>but when it links up
with the rest of its pals...</i>

333
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,641
Oh.

334
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,121
Whoa!

335
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,411
<i>...things get
a little more interesting.</i>

336
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,802
<i>The microbots are controlled
with this neural transmitter.</i>

337
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,405
Whoa!

338
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,401
<i>I think what I want them to</i> do...

339
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,446
<i>They do it.</i>

340
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,764
<i>The applications for this tech
are limitless.</i>

341
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,405
<i>Construction.</i>

342
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,251
<i>What used to take teams
of people working by hand</i>

343
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,646
<i>for months or years,</i>

344
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,451
<i>can now be accomplished
by one person.</i>

345
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,930
<i>And that's just the beginning.</i>

346
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,650
<i>How about transportation?</i>

347
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,288
<i>Microbots can move
anything anywhere,</i>

348
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,084
<i>with ease.</i>

349
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,443
<i>If you can think it,
the microbots can do it.</i>

350
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,481
<i>The only limit is your imagination.</i>

351
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,809
Microbots!

352
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,291
That's my nephew!

353
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,567
- Yes!
- Whoo-hoo!

354
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,366
My family! I love my family!

355
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,166
Nailed it!

356
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,169
- You did it!
- Not bad!

357
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,170
Yeah!
You just blew my mind, dude!

358
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,641
They loved you.
That was amazing!

359
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,160
Yes.

360
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,646
With some development,

361
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,446
your tech could be revolutionary.

362
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,725
Alistair Krei!

363
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,327
May I?

364
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,008
Hmm. Extraordinary.

365
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,369
I want your microbots at Krei Tech.

366
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,050
Shut up.

367
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,725
Mr. Krei is right.

368
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,725
Your microbots are
an inspired piece of tech.

369
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,530
You can continue to develop them,

370
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,205
or you can sell them to a man

371
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,402
who's only guided
by his own self-interest.

372
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,325
Robert, I know how you feel about me,

373
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,567
but it shouldn't affect...

374
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,370
This is your decision, Hiro.

375
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,561
But you should know

376
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,530
Mr. Krei has cut corners
and ignored sound science

377
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,920
to get where he is.

378
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,001
That's just not true.

379
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,765
I wouldn't trust Krei Tech
with your microbots,

380
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,368
or anything else.

381
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,370
Hiro, I'm offering you more money

382
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,926
than any 14-year-old could imagine.

383
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,009
I appreciate the offer, Mr. Krei,

384
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,360
but they're not for sale.

385
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,289
I thought you were smarter than that.

386
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,845
Robert.

387
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,931
Mr. Krei.

388
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,291
That's my brother's.

389
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,726
Oh. That's right.

390
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,043
I look forward to seeing you in class.

391
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,763
- Unbelievable!
- A-ha!

392
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,001
That's what I'm talking about.

393
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,361
All right, geniuses,
let's feed those hungry brains.

394
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,401
Back to the café!

395
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,762
- Dinner is on me!
- Whoo!

396
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,763
Yes! Nothing is better than free food!

397
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,764
- Aunt Cass?
- Unless it's moldy.

398
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,280
We'll, uh...
We'll catch up, okay?

399
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,602
Sure. I'm so proud of you.

400
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,484
Both of you.

401
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,802
Thanks, Aunt Cass.

402
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,240
I know what you're going to say.

403
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,084
"I should be
proud of myself,"

404
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,770
"because I'm finally using my gift

405
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,001
"for something important."

406
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,605
No, no.
I was just gonna tell you

407
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,926
your fly was down
for the whole show.

408
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,009
Ha-ha-hilarious.

409
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,971
What?

410
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,764
Ah.

411
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,006
Welcome to nerd school, nerd.

412
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,331
Hey, I, um...

413
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,285
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you. So,

414
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,325
you know,

415
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,325
thanks for not giving up on me.

416
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,007
Are you okay?

417
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,645
Yeah. I'm okay.

418
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,446
But Professor Callaghan
is still in there.

419
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,331
Tadashi, no!

420
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,290
Callaghan's in there.

421
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,682
Someone has to help.

422
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,684
Tadashi!

423
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,369
Tadashi!

424
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,924
Here. Have some tea.

425
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,124
Hey, sweetie.

426
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,561
Hey, Aunt Cass.

427
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,484
Mrs. Matsuda's in the café.

428
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,761
She's wearing something

429
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,360
super inappropriate
for an 80-year-old.

430
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,285
That always cracks you up.

431
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,483
You should come down.

432
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,850
- Maybe later.
- Oh.

433
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,925
The university called again.

434
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,164
It's, uh, been a few weeks
since classes started.

435
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,602
But they said
it's not too late to register.

436
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,369
Okay. Thanks.
I'll think about it.

437
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,841
<i>Hey, Hiro.</i>

438
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,731
<i>We just wanted to check in,
and see how you're doing.</i>

439
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,120
<i>We wish you were here, buddy.</i>

440
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,005
<i>Hiro, if I could have only
one superpower right now,</i>

441
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,561
<i>it would be the ability
to crawl through this camera,</i>

442
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,006
<i>and give you a big hug.</i>

443
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,365
Ow!

444
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,721
Ow!

445
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,362
Hello. I am Baymax,

446
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,926
your personal healthcare companion.

447
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,930
Uh, hey, Baymax.

448
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,765
I didn't know
you were still active.

449
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,928
I heard a sound of distress.

450
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,531
What seems to be the trouble?

451
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,643
Oh, I just stubbed
my toe a little.

452
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,006
I'm fine.

453
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,082
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how would you rate your pain?

454
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,081
A zero. I'm okay, really.

455
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,163
Thanks. You can shrink now.

456
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,851
Does it hurt when I touch it?

457
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,809
That's okay. No touching.

458
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,485
I'm fine... Ah!

459
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,321
Ow.

460
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,921
You have fallen.

461
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,121
You think?

462
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,121
Ow!

463
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,606
- On a scale of 1 to...
- Ow!

464
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,161
On a scale...
- On a sca... - Ow!

466
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,482
On a scale of 1 to 10...

467
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,162
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how would you rate your pain?

468
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,966
Zero.

469
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,322
- It is all right to cry.
- No. No, no, no, no.

470
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,125
Crying is a natural response to pain.

471
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,281
I'm not crying.

472
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,807
- I will scan you for injuries.
- Don't scan me.

473
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,650
- Scan complete.
- Unbelievable.

474
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,649
You have sustained no injuries.

475
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,326
However, your hormone
and neurotransmitter levels

476
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,325
indicate that you are
experiencing mood swings

477
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,686
common in adolescence.

478
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,321
Diagnosis, puberty.

479
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,641
Whoa, what?

480
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,247
Okay.
Time to shrink now.

481
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,369
You should expect an increase
in body hair,

482
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,002
especially on your face,
chest, armpits, and...

483
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,366
Thank you! That's enough.

484
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,171
You may also experience
strange and powerful new urges.

485
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,164
Okay! Let's get you
back in your luggage.

486
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,323
I cannot deactivate until you say

487
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,323
you are satisfied with your care.

488
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,321
Fine. I'm satisfied with my...
Whoa!

489
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,887
Huh?

490
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,370
My microbot?

491
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,843
This doesn't make any sense.

492
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,327
Puberty can often be a confusing time

493
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,522
for a young adolescent
flowering into manhood.

494
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,525
No. The thing is attracted
to the other microbots,

495
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,529
but that's impossible.

496
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,682
They were destroyed in the fire.

497
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,887
Dumb thing's broken.

498
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,041
Your tiny robot
is trying to go somewhere.

499
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,201
Oh, yeah?

500
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,886
Why don't you, uh, find out
where it's trying to go?

501
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,566
Would that stabilize
your pubescent mood swings?

502
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,047
Uh-huh. Absolutely.

503
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,046
Uh... Baymax?

504
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,250
Baymax?

505
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,526
Baymax?

506
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,246
What?

507
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,362
- Hiro?
- Hey, Aunt Cass!

508
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,761
Wow. You're up and...

509
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,769
Yeah! I figured it was time.

510
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,769
Are you registering for school?

511
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,921
Uh, yes.

512
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,810
I thought about what you said.
Really inspired me.

513
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,247
- Oh, honey, that's so great.
- Uh-huh.

514
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,126
Okay, special dinner tonight.

515
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,680
I'll whip up some chicken wings.

516
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,287
You know, with the hot sauce
that makes our faces numb.

517
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,130
- Okay, sounds good.
- Great!

518
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,760
Last hug.

519
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,926
Baymax!

520
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,727
Ah!

521
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,086
- Baymax!
- Hey!

522
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,361
Watch it!

523
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,641
Baymax!

524
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,650
Whoa!

525
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,126
Baymax!

526
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,971
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?

527
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,731
I have found where
your tiny robot wants to go.

528
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,331
I told you, it's broken.
It's not trying to go...

529
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,487
Huh?

530
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,531
Locked.

531
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,728
There is a window.

532
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,688
Please exercise caution.

533
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,241
A fall from this height
could lead to bodily harm.

534
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,201
Oh, no.

535
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,691
Shh!

536
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,201
Excuse me while I let out some air.

537
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,441
Are you done?

538
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,201
Yes.

539
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,929
It will take me a moment to re-inflate.

540
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,521
Fine, just keep it down.

541
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,404
My microbots?

542
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,961
Someone's making more.

543
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,166
Hiro?

544
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,608
You gave me a heart attack!

545
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,963
My hands are equipped
with defibrillators. Clear.

546
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,801
Stop, stop, stop!
It's just an expression.

547
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,163
Oh, no.

548
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,486
Run!

549
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,650
Oh, come on!

550
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,161
I am not fast.

551
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,844
Yeah, no kidding!

552
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,441
Go! Go! Come on.

553
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,880
Kick it down!

554
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,808
Then punch it!

555
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,966
Go! Go!

556
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,328
Oh, come on! Go, go, go!

557
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,647
Move it!

558
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,642
Ah! Come on!

559
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,168
Whoa. No, no.

560
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,242
Come on! The window!

561
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,326
Suck it in!

562
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,606
Whoa!

563
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,200
Baymax!

564
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,846
Hiro?

565
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,960
Come on, let's get out of here.

566
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,849
Go! Hurry!

567
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,968
All right, let me get this straight.

568
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,090
A man in a kabuki mask attacked you,

569
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,408
with an army of miniature flying robots.

570
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,041
"Microbots."

571
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,209
- Microbots.
- Yeah.

572
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,085
He was controlling them telepathically

573
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,129
with a neurocranial transmitter.

574
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,046
So, Mr. Kabuki was using ESP

575
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,925
to attack you and balloon man.

576
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,930
Did you file a report

577
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,691
when your flying robots were stolen?

578
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,968
No. I thought they were all destroyed.

579
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,164
Look, I know it sounds crazy,
but Baymax was there, too.

580
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,284
- Tell him.
- Yes, Officer.

581
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,324
He's telling the truth.

582
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,720
What the...
What's wrong with you?

583
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,480
Low battery.

584
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,687
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

585
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,330
Try to keep it together.

586
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,170
I'm healthcare,

587
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,448
your personal Baymax companion.

588
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,166
Kid, how about we call your parents

589
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,482
- and get them down here?
- What?

590
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,211
Write your name
and number down

591
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,241
on this piece of paper,
and we can... Oh!

592
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,007
I've gotta get you home
to your charging station.

593
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,961
Can you walk?

594
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,004
I will scan you now.
Scan complete.

595
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,523
Healthcare.

596
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,641
Okay.

597
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,887
If my aunt asks,

598
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,247
we were at school all day.
Got it?

599
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,721
We jumped out a window.

600
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,526
No! Quiet! Shh.

601
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,524
We jumped out a window.

602
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,883
You can't say things like that
around Aunt Cass.

603
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,571
Shh...

604
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,721
Huh?

605
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,401
Shh.

606
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,161
Hiro?

607
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,885
- You home, sweetie?
- Uh...

608
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,567
That's right.

609
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,206
I thought I heard you. Hi.

610
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,528
Hey, Aunt Cass.

611
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,843
Oh, look at my little college man.

612
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,042
Ah, I can't wait to hear all about it!

613
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,401
Oh, and wings are almost ready.

614
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,520
Whee!

615
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,561
Will you be quiet?

616
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,530
Yeah, wings! Whee!

617
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,401
All right, get ready to have
your face melted.

618
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,566
We are gonna feel
these things tomorrow.

619
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,091
You know what I'm saying?

620
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,241
Okay.

621
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,727
Sit down. Tell me everything.

622
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,281
Um...

623
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,442
The thing is that,
since I registered so late,

624
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,961
I've got a lot of school stuff
to catch up on.

625
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,446
What was that?

626
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,245
Mochi.

627
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,721
Ooh, that darn cat.

628
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,407
At least take a plate
for the road, okay?

629
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,771
- Don't work too...
- Thanks for understanding.

630
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,970
Hairy baby. Hairy baby.

631
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,204
All right, come on.

632
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,210
I'm healthcare,
your personal Baymax companion.

633
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,680
One foot in front of the other.

634
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,527
This doesn't make any sense.

635
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,044
Tadashi.

636
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,206
What?

637
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,850
Tadashi.

638
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,805
Tadashi's gone.

639
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,242
When will he return?

640
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,642
He's dead, Baymax.

641
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,486
Tadashi was
in excellent health.

642
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,569
With a proper diet and exercise,

643
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,842
he should have lived a long life.

644
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,766
Yeah, he should have.

645
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,209
But there was a fire and...

646
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,411
Now, he's gone.

647
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,881
- Tadashi is here.
- No.

648
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,521
People keep saying
he's not really gone.

649
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,003
As long as we remember him.

650
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,529
It still hurts.

651
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,530
I see no evidence of physical injury.

652
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,404
It's a different kind of hurt.

653
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,680
You are my patient.

654
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,200
I would like to help.

655
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,371
You can't fix this one, buddy.

656
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,241
Uh, what are you doing?

657
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,609
I am downloading
a database on personal loss.

658
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,280
Database downloaded.

659
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,882
Treatments include contact
with friends and loved ones.

660
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,406
I am contacting them now.

661
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,045
No, no, no!  I...
Don't do that.

662
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,560
Your friends have been contacted.

663
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,404
Unbelievable.

664
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,287
Now, what are you doing?

665
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,241
Other treatments include
compassion and physical reassurance.

666
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,720
I'm okay. Really.

667
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,009
You will be all right.
There, there.

668
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,651
Thanks, Baymax.

669
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,282
I am sorry about the fire.

670
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,410
It's okay. It was an accident.

671
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,726
Unless...

672
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,044
Unless it wasn't.

673
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,564
At the showcase,

674
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,200
that guy in the mask
stole my microbots. And...

675
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,920
And then set the fire to cover his tracks.

676
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,010
He's responsible for Tadashi.

677
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,449
We gotta catch that guy.

678
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,691
<i>It's alive!</i>

679
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,287
<i>It's alive, it's alive!
It's alive!</i>

680
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,646
If we're gonna catch that guy,

681
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,445
you need some upgrades.

682
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,810
Will apprehending
the man in the mask

683
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,200
improve your emotional state?

684
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,044
Absolutely.

685
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,846
Let's work on your moves.

686
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,961
Now, let's take care of this.

687
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,923
I have some concerns.

688
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,525
This armor may undermine

689
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,921
my non-threatening,
huggable design.

690
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,844
That's kind of the idea, buddy.

691
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,967
You look sick.

692
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,161
I cannot be sick.
I am a robot.

693
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,885
It's just an expression.

694
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,162
<i>Data transfer complete.</i>

695
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,803
I fail to see how karate makes me
a better healthcare companion.

696
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,482
You want to keep me healthy,
don't you?

697
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,846
Punch this.

698
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,723
Yes! Hammerfist!

699
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,481
Side kick!

700
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,846
Knifehand!

701
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,491
Back kick!

702
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,561
Gummy bears!

703
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,007
Yes!

704
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,210
Yeah! Fist bump!

705
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,080
"Fist bump" is not in
my fighting database.

706
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,688
No, this isn't a fighting thing.

707
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,002
It's what people do sometimes

708
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,807
when they're excited or pumped up.

709
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,360
Ba-da-la-la-la-la.

710
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,965
Hey, now you're getting it.

711
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,646
I will add "fist bump"
to my care-giving matrix.

712
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,161
All right.
Let's go get that guy.

713
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,245
Come On!

714
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,251
Get him, Baymax!

715
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,649
We're too late.

716
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,440
Your tiny robot
is trying to go somewhere.

717
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,325
Come on.

718
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,443
Always wait one hour after eating

719
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,761
before swimming.

720
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,121
Hey!

721
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,285
Come on!

722
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,285
Your heart rate has increased dramatic...

723
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,929
Shh! Okay, Baymax,
time to use those upgrades.

724
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,331
- Hiro?
- No, no, no!

725
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,766
Get out of here! Go!

726
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,530
Dude, what are you doing out here?

727
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,166
Nothing!
Just out for a walk.

728
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,004
Helps my pubescent mood swings.

729
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,287
Is that Baymax?

730
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,045
- Yeah, but you really...
- Uh...

731
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,846
Why is he wearing
carbon fiber underpants?

732
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,605
I also know karate.

733
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,927
You guys need to go.

734
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,970
No, don't push us away, Hiro.
We're here for you.

735
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,645
That's why Baymax contacted us.

736
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,120
Those who suffer a loss,

737
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,567
require support
from friends and loved ones.

738
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,767
Okay, but I...

739
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,683
Who would like
to share their feelings first?

740
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,370
Ooh. I'll go. Okay.

741
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,001
My name is Fred, and it has
been 30 days since my last...

742
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,884
Holy mother of Megazon!

743
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,805
Ah... Am I the only
one seeing this?

745
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,125
Oh, my gosh! Oh, no!

746
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:01,961
Go!

747
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,485
Baymax, get him!

748
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,964
No, no, no, no, no!
What are you doing?

749
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,406
I'm saving your life.

750
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,807
Baymax can handle that guy!

751
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,361
<i>Oh, no.</i>

752
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,280
Wasabi!

753
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,005
Ah. goodbye!

754
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,924
Hiro. Explanation. Now.

755
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,771
He stole my microbots.
He started the fire.

756
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,405
I don't know who he is!

757
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,121
Baymax, palm-heel strike!

758
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,321
Hard left!

759
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,401
Huh.

760
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,881
That mask, the black suit...

761
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,202
We're under attack
from a super villain, people!

762
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,965
I mean, how cool is that?

763
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,242
I mean, it's scary, obviously.
But how cool!

764
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,805
Why are we stopped?

765
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:08,881
The light's red!

766
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,521
There are no red lights in a car chase!

767
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,490
Why is he trying to kill us?

768
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,848
Um, why are you trying to kill us?

769
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,760
It's classic villain.
We've seen too much!

770
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,211
Let's not jump to conclusions.

771
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,204
We don't know he's trying to kill us.

772
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,441
Car!

773
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,920
He's trying to kill us!

774
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,205
Did you just put your blinker on?

775
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,805
You have to
indicate your turn!

776
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,086
It's the law!

777
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,124
That's it.

778
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,201
Uh!

779
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,166
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

780
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,043
Whoa!

781
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,881
Stop the car!

782
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,280
Baymax and I can take this guy!

783
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,530
Seatbelts save lives.

784
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,171
Buckle up, every time.

785
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,844
Ah... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

786
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:28,842
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

787
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,001
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

788
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,728
- Did we lose him?
- Look out!

789
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,326
Baymax, hold on!

790
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,847
We're not gonna make it!

791
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,887
We're gonna make it!

792
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:54,961
We're not gonna make it!

793
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,041
We're gonna make it!

794
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,565
- We're not gonna make it!
- We're gonna make it!

795
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,124
We made it! Yes!

796
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,688
I told you we'd make it!

797
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,922
Your injuries require my attention.

798
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,128
And your body temperatures are low.

799
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,847
We should get out of here.

800
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,889
I know a place.

801
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,560
- Ooh. Where are we?
- Ah...

802
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,771
Fred.

803
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,240
Where are you going?

804
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,410
<i>Oh. Welcome to mi casa.</i>

805
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,244
That's French for "front door."

806
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,084
It's really not.

807
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,401
Listen, nitwit.

808
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,086
A lunatic in a mask just tried to kill us.

809
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,685
I'm not in the mood for any...

810
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,362
Welcome home, Master Frederick.

811
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,250
Heathcliff, my man!

812
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,722
Come on in, guys.
We'll be safe in here.

813
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,007
Gimme some.

814
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,011
Ba-da-la-la-la-la.

815
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,851
Freddie,

816
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,850
this is your house?

817
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,804
I thought you lived under a bridge.

818
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,849
Well, technically,
it belongs to my parents.

819
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,129
They're on a vacay on the family island.

820
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,680
You know, we should
totally go some time. Frolic.

821
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,530
You gotta be kidding me.

822
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,365
If I wasn't just attacked
by a guy in a kabuki mask,

823
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,848
I think this would be
the weirdest thing I've seen today.

824
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:57,921
Mmm.

825
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,287
My brain hates my eyes
for seeing this.

826
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,885
Your body temperature is still low.

827
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,891
Yeah. Uh-huh.

828
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,931
Ahh!

829
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,486
It's like spooning a warm marshmallow.

830
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,329
Hmm, it's so nice.

831
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,164
Oh, yeah, ah, that's toasty.

832
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,968
Good robot.

833
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,768
Does this symbol
mean anything to you guys?

834
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,964
- Yes! It's a bird!
- No!

835
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,089
The guy in the mask
was carrying something

836
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,401
with this symbol on it.

837
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,729
Apprehending the man in the mask
will improve Hiro's emotional state.

838
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,485
Apprehend him?

839
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,000
We don't even know who he is.

840
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,765
I have a theory.

841
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,849
"Dr. Slaughter, MD"?

842
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,048
Actually,
millionaire weapons designer,

843
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,531
Malcolm Chazzletick.

844
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,041
"The Annihilator"?

845
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:54,806
Behind the mask,
industrialist Reid Axworthy.

846
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:59,008
"Baron von Destruct"?
Oh, just get to the point!

847
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,361
Don't you guys get it?

848
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,807
The man in the mask who attacked us

849
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,371
is none other than...

850
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,041
<i>Voilà!</i>

851
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,366
Alistair Krei.

852
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,090
- What?
- Think about it.

853
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,526
Krei wanted your microbots,

854
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,681
and you said no.

855
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,321
But rules don't apply to a man like Krei.

856
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,371
There's no way.
The guy is too high profile.

857
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,404
Then who was that guy in the mask?

858
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,210
I don't know.

859
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,402
We don't know anything about him.

860
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,881
His blood type is AB-negative.

861
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,406
Cholesterol levels are...

862
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,727
Baymax, you scanned him?

863
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,804
I am programed to assess
everyone's healthcare needs.

864
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,365
Yes!

865
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,927
I can use the data
from your scan to find him.

866
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,731
Uh, you'd have to scan
everyone in San Fransokyo.

867
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,884
That might take, I don't know, forever.

868
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,531
No, no, no, no. I...

869
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,762
I just have to look for another angle.

870
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,407
Got it!

871
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,608
I'll scan the whole city at the same time.

872
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,127
I just have to upgrade Baymax's sensor.

873
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,043
Actually, if we're gonna catch this guy,

874
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,609
I need to upgrade all of you.

875
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:00,927
Upgrade who, now?

876
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,640
Those who suffer a loss require support

877
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,569
from friends and loved ones.

878
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,121
Oh, okay,
I like where this is heading!

879
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,806
We can't go against that guy!
We're nerds!

880
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,371
Hiro, we want to help,

881
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,529
but we're just us.

882
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:15,841
No.

883
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,203
You can be way more.

884
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,725
Tadashi Hamada was our best friend.

885
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,845
We're in.

886
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,448
Can you feel it?
You guys, do you feel this?

887
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,523
Our origin story begins.

888
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,763
We're gonna be superheroes!

889
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,926
Arms up.

890
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,323
The neurotransmitter
must be in his mask.

891
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,689
We get the mask,
and he can't control the bots.

892
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,881
Game over.

893
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,003
<i>They say
"We are what we are"</i>

894
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,844
<i>But we don't have to be</i>

895
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,809
<i>I'm bad behavior</i>

896
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,566
<i>But I do it in the best way</i>

897
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,808
<i>I'll be the watcher</i>

898
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,525
<i>Of the eternal flame</i>

899
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,082
<i>I'll be the guard dog</i>

900
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,084
<i>Of all your fever dreams</i>

901
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,687
<i>I am the sand in the bottom
half of the hourglass</i>

902
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,650
<i>'Cause we could
be immortals</i>

903
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,761
<i>Immortals</i>

904
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:20,522
<i>Just not for long</i> For long

906
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,205
<i>Live with me forever now</i>

907
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,568
<i>Pull the blackout
curtains down</i>

908
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:29,842
<i>Just not for long
For long</i>

909
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:33,841
<i>We could be immortals</i>

910
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,530
<i>Immortals</i>

911
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,122
<i>Immortals</i>

912
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,606
<i>Immortals</i>

913
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,768
<i>Sometimes the only payoff</i>

914
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,167
<i>For having any faith</i>

915
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,442
<i>ls when it's tested again</i>

916
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,847
<i>And again Every day</i>

917
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,928
<i>I'm still comparing your past</i>

918
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,088
<i>To my future</i>

919
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,808
<i>'Cause we could be immortals</i>

920
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,651

<i>Just not for long
For long</i>

922
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,490
Super Jump!

923
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,681
Super Jump!

924
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,960
<i>And live with me forever now</i>

925
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,570
<i>Pull the blackout curtains down</i>

926
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,480
- Whoo-hoo! I breathe fire.
<i>- Just</i> not for long

927
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,681
<i>For long</i>

928
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:18,250
<i>We could be immortals
Immortals</i>

929
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,447
<i>- immortals
- Whoa!</i>

930
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,604
<i>Immortals</i>

931
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,970
<i>Immortals</i>

932
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,401
<i>Immortals - Ah! - Immortals</i>

933
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,445
<i>Immortals</i>

934
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,488
<i>Immortals</i>

935
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,930
- Whoo-hoo!
- I love it!

936
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,326
Not bad.

937
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,329
Anybody else's suit
riding up on them?

938
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,447
Hey, guys!

939
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,524
Check this out.

940
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:49,330
I'd like to introduce,
Baymax 2.0.

941
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,842
He's glorious.

942
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,405
Hello.

943
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:06,487
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Hold up. Focus.

944
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,882
Show 'em what you got, buddy.

945
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,327
The fist, show them the fist.

946
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,641
Ba-da-la-la-la-la.

947
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,484
No, not that.

948
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,405
The thing, the other thing.

949
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,161
Whoa!

950
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,723
Rocket fist make Freddie so happy!

951
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,282
That's just one of his new upgrades!

952
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,204
Baymax, wings.

953
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,048
No way!

954
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,690
Thrusters.

955
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,286
I fail to see how flying

956
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,363
makes me a better
healthcare companion.

957
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,409
I fail to see how you fail to see

958
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,641
that it's awesome!

959
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,206
Full thrust.

960
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,602
- Whoa!
- Steady, big guy.

961
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,530
Look, let's just take this slow.

962
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,688
Up, up, up, up, up!

963
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,126
Thrust, thrust, thrust!

964
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,930
Too much thrust!
Too much thrust!

965
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,525
Too much thrust!

966
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,961
No, no, no, no!

967
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,207
Back on! Back on!

968
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,606
On! On! On!

969
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,611
Zoom...

970
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,321
Oh!

971
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,290
Go up! Up, up, up!

972
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,361
Up!

973
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,845
Oh, man!

974
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,928
Maybe...
Maybe enough flying for today.

975
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,244
What do you say?

976
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,051
Your neurotransmitter levels
are rising steadily.

977
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,521
Which means what?

978
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,163
The treatment is working.

979
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,731
Oh, no!

980
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,286
No, no, no, no, no!

981
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,244
Whoa, Baymax!

982
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,961
Yes!

983
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:10,971
Whoo!

984
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,845
Whoo!

985
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,848
Yeah! Oh!

986
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,281
Whoa!

987
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,166
Yes!

988
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,762
Whoo-hoo!

989
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,001
Wow!

990
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,121
That was...

991
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,245
That was...

992
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:08,926
Sick.

993
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,127
It is just an expression.

994
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,362
That's... That's right, buddy.

995
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,205
I am never taking the bus again.

996
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,285
Your emotional state has improved.

997
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,444
I can deactivate if you say

998
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,329
you are satisfied with your care.

999
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,245
What?

1000
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,084
No, I don't want
you to deactivate.

1001
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,724
We still have
to find that guy.

1002
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,882
So, fire up that super-sensor.

1003
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,050
Functionality improved.

1004
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,170
1000% increase in range.

1005
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,681
I have found a match...

1006
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,849
...on that island.

1007
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,448
- Killer view.
- Yeah. If I...

1008
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:06,603
If I wasn't
terrified of heights,

1009
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:07,886
I'd probably love this.

1010
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,361
But I'm terrified of heights,
so I don't love it.

1011
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:19,089
There. Baymax, take us in.

1012
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:26,681
Awesome!

1013
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,121
Our first landing together as a team.

1014
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,089
Guys, come on.

1015
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,367
"Quarantine"?

1016
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:35,251
Uh, do you people know
what "quarantine" means?

1017
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,363
"Quarantine."
Enforced isolation

1018
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,722
to prevent contamination
that could lead to disease,

1019
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,570
or, in some cases, death.

1020
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,047
Oh! There's a skull face on this one.

1021
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,281
A skull face!

1022
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,646
Be ready.

1023
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,723
He could be anywhere.

1024
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,890
Fire!

1025
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,280
- Spitting fire! Spitting fire!
Yee-ha!

1026
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,244
That was a bird.

1027
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,807
Well, at least
we know our gear works.

1028
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,922
<i>Six intrepid friends</i>

1029
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,366
<i>Led by Fred</i>

1030
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,204
<i>Their leader, Fred</i>

1031
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,681
<i>Fred's Angels
Mm-mmm</i>

1032
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,282
<i>Fred's Angels
Mm-mmm</i>

1033
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,449
<i>Harnessing
the power of the sun</i>

1034
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:40,042
<i>With the ancient amulet
They found in the attic</i>

1035
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,610
<i>The amulet is green</i>

1036
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,125
<i>It's probably an emerald</i>

1037
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,488
Fred, I will laser-hand
you in the face.

1038
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,125
Guys. Shh.

1039
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,045
Any sign of him, Baymax?

1040
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,291
This structure is
interfering with my sensor.

1041
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,007
Perfect. The robot's broken.

1042
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:03,486
Uh, guys,
you might want to see this.

1043
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,842
What do you think
it is, genius?

1044
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,691
I'm not sure.
But look.

1045
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,481
Hiro.

1046
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,091
Krei.

1047
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,686
<i>That's right.</i>

1048
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:00,241
<i>We were asked
to do the impossible.</i>

1049
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,401
<i>That's what we did.</i>

1050
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:03,681
<i>We've reinvented</i>

1051
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,286
<i>the very concept of transportation.</i>

1052
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:11,048
<i>Friends, I present
Project Silent Sparrow.</i>

1053
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,281
<i>General, may I?</i>

1054
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,568
Whoa! Magic hat!

1055
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,891
<i>Teleportation.</i>

1056
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,810
<i>The transport of matter
instantaneously through space.</i>

1057
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:40,130
<i>Not science fiction anymore.</i>

1058
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,249
<i>Now, we didn't spend billions
of tax dollars</i>

1059
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,646
<i>to teleport hats.</i>

1060
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:49,722
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
you're here to witness history.</i>

1061
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,565
<i>Ready to go for a ride, Abigail?</i>

1062
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,443
<i>We've invited all these people.</i>

1063
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,250
<i>Might as well give 'em a show.</i>

1064
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,131
<i>T-minus 30 seconds to launch.</i>

1065
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,404
<i>- 29... 28...
<i>- This is Argo.</i>

1066
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,250
- Capsule's in position.
- 27.</i> ..

1067
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:08,121
<i>Sir, we've picked up a slight irregularity
in the magnetic containment field.</i>

1068
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:11,090
<i>- Huh.
- Mr. Krei, is there a problem?</i>

1069
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:12,651
<i>No. No problem.</i>

1070
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,281
<i>It's well within the parameters.</i>

1071
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,771
<i>Let's move forward.</i>

1072
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,764
<i>3... 2... 1...</i>

1073
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:20,445
<i>Cabin pressure is go.</i>

1074
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,489
<i>Pod engaged.</i>

1075
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,604
<i>Field breach! Abort!</i>

1076
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:30,002
<i>We've lost all contact
with the pod.</i>

1077
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,367
Oh, no.

1078
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:34,886
<i>- It's breaking up!
- The pilot is gone.</i>

1079
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,560
Portal two <i>is</i> down-

1080
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,244
<i>The magnetic containment field's down!</i>

1081
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:47,483
<i>Krei, shut it down now!</i>

1082
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,170
<i>I want
this island sealed off!</i>

1083
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,204
The government shut down
Krei's experiment.

1084
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,165
And he's using your microbots
to steal his machine back.

1085
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,329
Krei is the guy in the mask.

1086
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,211
<i>Oh, no.</i>

1087
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,408
Baymax, get us out of here.

1088
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:19,841
Go for the transmitter.

1089
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,491
Behind his mask.

1090
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,367
Baymax!

1091
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:28,521
All right, what's the plan?

1092
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,046
It's Fred time.

1093
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,166
Super Jump!

1094
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:33,847
Gravity Crush!

1095
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,041
Oh!

1096
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,360
Falling hard.

1097
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,166
Seriously, what is the plan?

1098
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,727
- Get the mask.
- Right behind you.

1099
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,928
For real, what is the plan?

1100
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,367
Hey!

1101
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:22,841
Hey!

1102
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:27,724
Uh, you want to dance,
masked man? Huh?

1103
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,610
'Cause you'll be
dancing with these.

1104
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:32,730
Hand over the mask,
or you'll get a taste of this!

1105
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,001
And a little bit of that!

1106
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:40,409
Whoo!

1107
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:42,409
Hey! <i>I</i> did all right.

1108
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:44,490
Is that all you got?

1109
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:47,089
Oh. You got that, too?

1110
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,241
It's back into the fire!

1111
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,130
It's over, Krei.

1112
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:34,208
Pro... Professor Callaghan?

1113
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:38,649
The explosion...

1114
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:39,961
You died.

1115
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,646
No. I had your microbots.

1116
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:48,650
But, Tadashi.

1117
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:49,881
You just let him die.

1118
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,327
Give me the mask, Hiro.

1119
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,005
He went in there to save you!

1120
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,486
That was his mistake!

1121
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,642
Baymax, destroy.

1122
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:07,090
My programing prevents me
from injuring a human being.

1123
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:08,526
Not anymore.

1124
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,523
Hiro, this is not what...

1125
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,361
Do it, Baymax! Destroy him!

1126
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,845
No! Stop, Baymax!

1127
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,727
No, stop! He's getting away!

1128
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,569
Baymax!

1129
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,921
My healthcare protocol
has been violated.

1130
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:22,726
I regret any distress
I may have caused.

1131
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,247
How could you do that?
I had him!

1132
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,250
What you just did,
we never signed up for.

1133
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,568
We said we'd catch the guy.

1134
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:31,801
That's it.

1135
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,929
I never should have
let you help me!

1136
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,924
Baymax, find Callaghan.

1137
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,003
My enhanced scanner
has been damaged.

1138
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:44,526
Wings.

1139
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:46,925
Hiro, this isn't
part of the plan.

1140
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,451
Fly!

1141
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,210
Hiro!

1142
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,608
Your blood pressure
is elevated.

1143
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,009
You appear to be distressed.

1144
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,730
I'm fine!

1145
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,731
There. Is it working?

1146
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,651
- My sensor is operational.
- Good.

1147
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,491
Then let's get...

1148
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,126
What?

1149
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,482
Are you going to remove
my healthcare chip?

1150
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,330
Yes. Open!

1151
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,365
My purpose is to heal
the sick and injured.

1152
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,522
Baymax,
open your access port.

1153
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,328
Do you want me to terminate
Professor Callaghan?

1154
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,483
Just open!

1155
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:44,003
Will terminating
Professor Callaghan

1156
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,366
improve your emotional state?

1157
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,728
Yes! No! I don't know!

1158
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,001
Open your access!

1159
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,680
- Is this what Tadashi wanted?
- It doesn't matter!

1160
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,080
Tadashi programed me
to aid and...

1161
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,323
Tadashi's gone!

1162
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,201
Tadashi's gone.

1163
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,323
Tadashi is here.

1164
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:08,883
No. He's not here.

1165
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:11,926
Tadashi is here.

1166
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,927
<i>This is Tadashi Hamada.</i>

1167
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:19,761
<i>And this is the first test
of my robotics project.</i>

1168
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,281
<i>- Hello, I</i> am Baymax.

1169
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,090
<i>Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop! Stop!</i>

1170
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,204
<i>The seventh test
of my robotics project.</i>

1171
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:30,606
<i>Hello, I...</i>

1172
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:32,964
<i>What? Ooh, what?</i>

1173
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,249
<i>Wait, wait, wait, stop!
Stop scan! Stop...</i>

1174
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,882
<i>Tadashi Hamada again,</i>

1175
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:43,244
<i>and this is the 33rd test
of my robotics project.</i>

1176
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,923
<i>I'm not giving up on you.</i>

1177
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,731
<i>You don't understand this yet,
but people need you.</i>

1178
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,564
<i>So, let's get back to work.</i>

1179
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,891
<i>This is, uh, Tadashi Hamada,</i>

1180
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:03,489
<i>and this is the 84th test.</i>

1181
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,290
<i>What do you say, big guy?</i>

1182
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,921
<i>Hello, I am Baymax,</i>

1183
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,003
<i>your personal healthcare companion.</i>

1184
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,287
<i>It works.</i>

1185
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,641
<i>It works!</i>

1186
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:17,331
<i>Oh, this is amazing! You...
You work!</i>

1187
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,928
<i>I knew it!
I knew it! I knew it.</i>

1188
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:23,243
<i>I knew it. Oh, you work.
I can't believe it! I can't...</i>

1189
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,841
<i>Okay.
All right, big moment, here.</i>

1190
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,250
Scan me.

1191
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:32,131
<i>Your neurotransmitter
levels are elevated.</i>

1192
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,448
<i>This indicates that you are happy.</i>

1193
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,967
<i>I am. I really am.</i>

1194
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:41,007
<i>Oh, man.
Wait till my brother sees you.</i>

1195
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,921
<i>You're gonna help
so many people, buddy.</i>

1196
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,690
<i>So many.</i>

1197
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:49,601
<i>That's all for now.
I am satisfied with my care.</i>

1198
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,642
Thank you, Baymax.

1199
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,689
I'm so sorry.

1200
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,401
I guess I'm not like my brother.

1201
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:12,411
Hiro.

1202
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:18,891
Guys, I... Uh, I...

1203
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,807
We're going to catch Callaghan,

1204
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:27,208
and, this time, we'll do it right.

1205
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:31,320
Eh, but maybe
don't leave your team

1206
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,084
stranded on a spooky
island next time.

1207
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,081
- Oh, man.
- Nah, it's cool.

1208
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,322
Heathcliff picked us up
in the family chopper.

1209
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:41,251
Hiro, we found something
you should see.

1210
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:46,606
<i>You almost got us all killed!</i>

1211
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,922
<i>Krei! You did this!</i>

1212
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,889
<i>You knew it wasn't ready!</i>

1213
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,842
Callaghan? He was there?

1214
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:57,084
He was such a good man.
What happened?

1215
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,566
I don't know.

1216
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,529
But the answer's here somewhere.

1217
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,203
Wait, wait! Stop.

1218
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,010
There he is.

1219
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,842
With the pilot.

1220
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,240
Hang on.

1221
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:14,370
<i>We've invited
all these people...</i>

1222
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,603
The pilot was
Callaghan's daughter.

1223
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,803
Callaghan blames Krei.

1224
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:24,407
This is a revenge story.

1225
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,444
So, what are we waiting for?

1226
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:29,571
It's all set up.

1227
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,409
<i>This beautiful new campus</i>

1228
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,205
<i>is the culmination of a lifelong dream.</i>

1229
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,968
<i>But none of this
would've been possible</i>

1230
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,447
<i>without a few bumps in the road.</i>

1231
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:48,129
<i>Those setbacks made us stronger,
and set us on the path</i>

1232
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,487
to a <i>bright</i> future.

1233
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:51,681
What is that?

1234
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:53,450
- What?
- Setback?

1235
01:16:58,160 --> 01:16:59,491
Ah!

1236
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:08,327
Was my daughter a "setback"?

1237
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,762
Callaghan! But you...

1238
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:12,841
Your daughter, that...

1239
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,320
That was an accident.

1240
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:17,444
No! You knew it was unsafe.

1241
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:20,086
My daughter is gone
because of your arrogance.

1242
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,001
What are you doing?

1243
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:35,611
You took everything from me

1244
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:38,286
when you sent Abigail
into that machine.

1245
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:42,129
Now I'm taking everything from you.

1246
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,401
No!

1247
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,170
No! No! You can't!

1248
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:00,891
You're going to watch
everything you've built disappear.

1249
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,646
Then, it's your turn.

1250
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,530
Professor Callaghan!

1251
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,161
Let him go!

1252
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,200
Is this what Abigail would've wanted?

1253
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,044
Abigail is gone!

1254
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:21,364
This won't change anything.
Trust me, I know.

1255
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,250
Listen to the kid, Callaghan.

1256
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:26,481
Please, let me go.

1257
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,682
I'll give you anything you want!

1258
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:32,243
I want my daughter back!

1259
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,161
Go for the mask!

1260
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:55,401
Baymax!

1261
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:57,360
Leaping into action!

1262
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,565
Oh, no!

1263
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:29,401
Ha!

1264
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,404
Getting a little tight.

1265
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:36,127
Ah!

1266
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:40,286
Oh!

1267
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,602
- No!
- He's too strong!

1268
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,000
<i>- There's no way out!
- You can't beat him!</i>

1269
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,440
<i>Help!
I can't beat him.</i>

1270
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:55,926
<i>Hiro!</i>

1271
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,287
<i>- Hiro? Hiro?
- Help!</i>

1272
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,007
- That's it!
- Hiro.

1273
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:01,720
- I know how to beat him.
- Hiro.

1274
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:03,487
Listen up!

1275
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:04,926
<i>Use those big brains of yours</i>

1276
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,520
<i>And think your way
around the problem.</i>

1277
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,010
<i>Look for a new angle.</i>

1278
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,126
My arms!
They can't go any further!

1279
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:28,609
Wait a second, it's a suit.

1280
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,451
Hello, sign.

1281
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,961
Care to go for a little spin?

1282
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,645
Hi-ya! Double spin!

1283
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:36,801
Behind-the-back spin!

1284
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,126
Yeah!

1285
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:39,681
Yeah!

1286
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:51,641
Baymax!

1287
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,650
Hiro.

1288
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,762
I love that robot!
Ow!

1289
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:28,003
Okay, new plan.
Forget the mask.

1290
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:29,287
Take out the bots.

1291
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:30,401
They'll get sucked up
into the portal.

1292
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,040
Now that is a plan!

1293
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,288
Honey, Fred,
can you give us some cover?

1294
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:36,250
Like you have to ask.

1295
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:37,527
Let's do this, Freddie!

1296
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,440
Smokescreen!

1297
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:54,040
Ready and

1298
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:56,086
dive!

1299
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:06,041
Whoa, the gravity's getting
a little weird here, guys!

1300
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,247
Wait.

1301
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:08,601
Let's use this!

1302
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,726
These are green blades
of fury!

1303
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:17,645
Woman up!

1304
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:25,730
Double sign-spin.

1305
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,128
Now my signs are on fire!

1306
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,841
Whoo!

1307
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,041
Whoo!

1308
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,447
Now that's a chemical reaction!

1309
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:45,087
Back kick.
Knifehand. Roundhouse.

1310
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:46,611
Hammerfist.

1311
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:54,291
This ends now!

1312
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:01,924
Looks like you're
out of microbots.

1313
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:03,161
What?

1314
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,286
Baymax!

1315
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:12,127
No!

1316
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:14,841
Huh?

1317
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:24,041
Our programing prevents us
from injuring a human being.

1318
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:26,647
But we'll take that.

1319
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:29,964
Whoa!

1320
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:59,366
It's still on!
We have to shut it down!

1321
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,841
We can't!
The containment field is failing.

1322
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,242
The portal is gonna tear itself apart!

1323
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,164
We need to get out of here, now!

1324
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:13,801
Baymax!

1325
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:16,167
My sensor is detecting signs of life.

1326
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:19,244
- What?
- Coming from there.

1327
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,209
The life signs are female.

1328
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:23,562
She appears to be in hyper-sleep.

1329
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,884
Callaghan's daughter.
She's still alive.

1330
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,446
Abigail.

1331
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,286
Let's go get her.

1332
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:34,205
The portal is destabilizing.
You'll never make it.

1333
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,370
She's alive in there.

1334
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,210
Someone has to help.

1335
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:41,128
What do you say, buddy?

1336
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:43,966
Flying makes me
a better healthcare companion.

1337
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:13,761
Careful! There's Krei
Tech debris everywhere.

1338
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,929
Look out!

1339
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:40,445
Ah!

1340
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,290
I have located the patient.

1341
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:48,520
Hurry!

1342
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:07,804
Come on, buddy,
let's get her home.

1343
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:15,367
I'll guide you out of here.
Let's go!

1344
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:22,931
Veer right!

1345
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,842
Okay, to the left.

1346
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,051
Hard right!

1347
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:30,520
Up and over.

1348
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,161
Okay, level off. Easy.

1349
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:38,282
Whoo-hoo! Nice flying!

1350
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,210
Almost there!

1351
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,441
Baymax!

1352
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,041
Baymax!

1353
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,204
My thrusters are inoperable.

1354
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:11,281
Just grab hold.

1355
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,243
There is still a way
I can get you both to safety.

1356
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:32,289
I cannot deactivate until you say
you are satisfied with your care.

1357
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:34,807
No, no, no, no.
Wait. What about you?

1358
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:36,840
- You are my patient.
- Baymax.

1359
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:38,245
Your health is my only concern.

1360
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:40,045
Stop! I'm gonna figure out...

1361
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:41,765
Are you satisfied
with your care?

1362
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:43,723
No.
There's gotta be another way.

1363
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,810
I'm not gonna leave you here.
I'll think of something.

1364
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,411
There is no time.

1365
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,284
Are you satisfied with your care?

1366
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,966
Please! No...

1367
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,164
I can't lose you, too.

1368
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:57,526
Hiro,

1369
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,601
I will always be with you.

1370
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,762
I'm satisfied with my care.

1371
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:05,806
Hiro!

1372
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,968
Yeah! They made it!

1373
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,886
Baymax?

1374
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:33,330
Miss, can you hear me?
What is your name?

1375
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,410
Abigail Callaghan.

1376
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:38,206
Okay, Abigail,
you are gonna be fine.

1377
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:39,651
We're taking you to the hospital.

1378
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:41,881
Move it!

1379
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:46,401
Get in there.

1380
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,049
<i>A massive
cleanup continues today</i>

1381

<i>at the headquarters
of Krei Tech Industries.</i>

1382
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,010
<i>Reports are still flooding in</i>

1383
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:08,800
<i>about a group of
unidentified individuals,</i>

1384
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:10,604
<i>who prevented
what could have been</i>

1385
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:11,960
<i>a major catastrophe.</i>

1386
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:14,726
<i>The whole city
of San Fransokyo is asking,</i>

1387
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:15,961
<i>"Who are these heroes?</i>

1388
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:17,201
<i>"And where are they now?"</i>

1389
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,691
- Hey.
- Hi.

1390
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:20,926
It's so exciting.

1391
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,326
Hey, sweetie!

1392
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:23,607
Okay.

1393
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:25,961
Mmm...

1394
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:28,166
Last hug.

1395
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,561
Bye!

1396
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:35,243
- And just then I was like...
- Get out of here.

1397
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:57,570
Bah-la-la-la-la.

1398
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:15,281
Ow?

1399
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:19,931
I am Baymax,

your personal healthcare companion.

1401
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:25,208
Hello, Hiro.

1402
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,164
Whoo-hoo!

1403
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,521
<i>We didn't set out
to be superheroes,</i>

1404

<i>but sometimes life doesn't go
the way you planned.</i>

1405
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:49,126
<i>The good thing is, my brother
wanted to help a lot of people,</i>

1406
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:50,844
<i>and that's what we're gonna do.</i>

1407
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:52,560
<i>Who are we?</i>

1408
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:03,328
<i>They say,
"We are what we are"</i>

1409
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:05,562
<i>But we don't have to be</i>

1410
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:06,920
<i>I'm bad behavior</i>

1411
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:10,044
<i>But I do it
in the best way</i>

1412
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:12,284
<i>I'll be the watcher</i>

<i>And again

1432

my accomplishments with you.

01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,329
You mean so much to me,
and honestly,

1456
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:29,801
I've always felt a distance

1457
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:33,249
what with you being
on the family island all the time,

1458
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:35,610
and I just wish
you could see how...

I wear 'em front,
I wear 'em back.
