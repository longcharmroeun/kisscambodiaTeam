1
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,000
I should've known that you would
be here, Professor McGonagall.

2
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,400
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.

3
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,899
Are the rumors true, Albus?

4
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:52,299
I'm afraid so, professor.
The good and the bad.

5
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,799
- And the boy?
- Hagrid is bringing him.

6
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,199
Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid
with something as important as this?

7
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,400
Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid
with my life.

8
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,299
Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor McGonagall.

9
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,399
- No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
- No, sir.

10
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,200
Little tyke fell asleep just
as we were flying over Bristol.

11
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,400
Try not to wake him.

12
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,300
There you go.

13
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,199
Albus, do you really think it's safe,
leaving him with these people?

14
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,699
I've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles, imaginable.

15
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,899
- They really are...
- The only family he has.

16
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:08,499
This boy will be famous. There won't be a child
in our world who doesn't know his name.

17
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,999
Exactly.

18
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,600
He's far better off growing up
away from all of that.

19
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,800
Until he's ready.

20
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,300
There, there, Hagrid.
It's not really goodbye, after all.

21
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,700
Good luck...

22
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,800
...Harry Potter.

23
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,400
Up. Get up!

24
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,600
Now!

25
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,600
Wake up, cousin!
We're going to the zoo!

26
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,100
- Here he comes, the birthday boy.
- Happy birthday, son.

27
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,999
Why don't you just cook the breakfast,
and try not to burn anything.

28
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,199
- Yes, Aunt Petunia.
- I want everything to be perfect...

29
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,299
...for my Dudley's special day!

30
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,600
- Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
- Yes, Uncle Vernon.

31
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,900
Aren't they wonderful, darling?

32
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,499
- How many are there?
- 36. Counted them myself.

33
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,899
36?! But last year... last year I had 37!

34
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,481
But some of them are quite a
bit bigger than last year's.

35
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:27,999
I don't care how big they are!

36
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,699
Oh, now, now, now. This is
what we're going to do...

37
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:35,400
...is that when we go out, we're going to buy
you two new presents. How's that, pumpkin?

38
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:43,000
It should be a lovely day at the zoo.
I'm really looking forward to it.

39
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,099
I'm warning you now, boy.

40
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,699
Any funny business, any at all...

41
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,100
...and you won't have
any meals for a week.

42
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,600
Get in.

43
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,200
Make it move.

44
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,499
Move!

45
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,199
- Move!
- He's asleep!

46
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,000
He's boring.

47
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,799
Sorry about him.

48
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,800
He doesn't understand
what it's like, lying there day after day...

49
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,200
...watching people press
their ugly faces in on you.

50
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,600
Can you hear me?

51
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,200
It's just, I've never talked
to a snake before.

52
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,999
Do you...?

53
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,400
I mean, do you talk to people often?

54
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,699
You're from Burma, aren't you?
Was it nice there?

55
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,300
Do you miss your family?

56
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,799
I see. That's me as well.
I never knew my parents either.

57
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,100
Mummy, Dad, come here! you won't believe
what this snake is doing!

58
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,099
Thanks.

59
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,900
Anytime.

60
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,100
Snake!

61
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,899
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

62
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,300
My darling boy!
How did you get in there?

63
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,900
Who did this? How did you get
in there? ls there a snake?

64
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,100
It's all right, sweetheart.
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.

65
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,699
- What happened?
- I swear, I don't know!

66
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,800
One minute the glass was there and
then it was gone, it was like magic.

67
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,000
There's no such thing as magic.

68
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,200
And smile!

69
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,499
Vernon, just look at him!
I can't believe it!

70
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,199
In just a week, he'll be off to Smeltings.

71
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,199
Caveat Smeltonia.
Proudest moment of my life.

72
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,600
Will I have to wear that too?

73
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,900
What? You? Go to Smeltings?

74
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,899
Don't be so stupid! You're going to go
to the state school. Where you belong.

75
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,599
This is what you'll going to be wearing,
when I finish dyeing it.

76
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,099
That's Dudley's old uniform.
It'll fit me like bits of old elephant skin.

77
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,699
It'll fit you well enough.

78
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,700
Go get the post. Go!

79
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,199
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

80
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,599
- Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
- Hey, give it back! It's mine!

81
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,600
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

82
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,500
No more mail through this letterbox.

83
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,000
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.

84
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,500
Shoo! Go on.

85
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,200
Fine day, Sunday.

86
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,499
In my opinion, best day of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?

87
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,099
- Because there's no post on Sundays?
- Right you are, Harry!

88
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,200
No post on Sunday.

89
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,500
No blasted letters today! No, sir.

90
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:31,000
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!

91
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,300
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable...

92
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,000
Make it stop, please!

93
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,800
Stop it!

94
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,800
Mummy, what's happening?

95
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,600
Give me that! Give me that letter!

96
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,000
Get off!

97
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,900
They're my letters! Let go of me!

98
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,800
That's it! We're going away!

99
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,999
Far away, where they can't find us!

100
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,600
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

101
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,800
Make a wish, Harry.

102
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,900
Who's there?

103
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,500
Sorry about that.

104
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:01,000
I demand that you leave at once, Sir!
You are breaking and entering!

105
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,700
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.

106
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,299
Mind, I haven't seen you
since you was a baby, Harry.

107
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:20,099
But you're a bit more along than I would have
expected. Particularly 'round the middle.

108
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,200
I'm not Harry.

109
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,800
- I am.
- Well, of course you are.

110
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,999
Got something for you.

111
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,900
Afraid I might have sat on it at somepoint,
but I imagine it'll taste fine just the same.

112
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,800
Baked it myself, words and all.

113
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,399
Thank you.

114
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,800
It's not every day that your young man
turns 11, now is it?

115
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,999
Excuse me, who are you?

116
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,199
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.

117
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,200
- Of course, you know all about Hogwarts.
- Sorry, no.

118
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,699
No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where
your mum and dad learned it all?

119
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,299
Learnt what?

120
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,100
You're a wizard, Harry.

121
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,299
- I'm a what?
- A wizard.

122
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,599
And a thumping good one, I'd wager,
once you're trained up little.

123
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,699
No, you've made a mistake.
I mean...

124
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,000
...l can't be a wizard.

125
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,400
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.

126
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,399
Well, Just Harry, did you ever
make anything happen?

127
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:00,300
Anything you couldn't explain,
when you were angry or scared?

128
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,799
"Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to inform you...

129
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,199
...that you have been accepted at
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

130
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:28,399
He will not be going there! We swore when we
took him in we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.

131
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,799
You knew? You knew all along
and you never told me?

132
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,099
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?

133
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,999
My perfect sister being who she was.

134
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,199
My mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter.

135
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,599
"We have a witch in the family.
Isn't it wonderful?"

136
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,499
I was the only one to see her
for what she was.

137
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,399
A freak!

138
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,599
Then she met that Potter,
and then she had you...

139
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,499
...and I knew you would be the same.
Just as strange, just as abnormal.

140
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,699
And then, if you please, she went and got
herself blown up! And we got landed with you.

141
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,999
Blown up? You told me
my parents died in a car crash.

142
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,499
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?

143
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,599
- We had to say something.
- It's an outrage! It's a scandal!

144
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,299
He'll not be going.

145
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,799
Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's
going to stop him, are you?

146
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,100
Muggle?

147
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,399
Non-magic folk. This boy's had
his name down ever since he were born.

148
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,499
He's going to the finest school
of witchcraft and wizardry in the world and...

149
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:45,599
...he'll be under the finest headmaster that
Hogwarts has ever seen, Albus Dumbledore.

150
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,599
I will not pay to have some crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.

151
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,399
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...

152
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,700
...in front of me.

153
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:20,799
Oh, um, I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.

154
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,200
- Strickly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.
- Okay.

155
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,500
Ooh, We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.

156
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,900
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.

157
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,800
"First year's students will require
three sets of plain work robes...

158
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,799
...one wand."

159
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,099
Essential bit of equipment, Harry.

160
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:07,099
"One pair of dragon hide gloves."
Hagrid, Do they mean from a real dragon?

161
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,600
They don't mean a penguin, do they?

162
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,800
- Crikey. I'd love a dragon.
- You'd like a dragon?

163
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,900
Vastly misunderstood beasts, Harry.
Vastly misunderstood.

164
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,099
"All students must be equipped with...

165
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,299
...one standard size 2
pewter cauldron...

166
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:40,299
...and may bring, if they desire,
either an owl, a cat or a toad."

167
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,099
Can we find all this in London?

168
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,800
If you know where to go.

169
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,399
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

170
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,499
No, thanks, Tom.
I'm on official Hogwarts business.

171
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,899
Just helping young Harry here
buy his school supplies.

172
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,700
Bless my soul.
It's Harry Potter!

173
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,399
Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.

174
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,000
Doris Crockford, Mr Potter.
I can't believe I'm meeting you at last.

175
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,599
Harry Potter. Can't tell you
how pleased I am to meet you.

176
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,399
Hello, professor. I didn't see you there.

177
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,599
Harry, This is Professor Quirrell. He will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.

178
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,299
Oh, nice to meet you.

179
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,499
Fearfully fascinating subject.

180
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:59,500
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?

181
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,499
Yes, well, must be going now.
Lots to buy.

182
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
Goodbye.

183
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,699
- See, Harry? You're famous.
- But why am I famous, Hagrid?

184
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,399
All those people back there,
how is it they know who I am?

185
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,500
I'm not sure I'm exactly the right person
to tell you that, Harry.

186
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,300
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.

187
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,099
Here's where you'll get your quills and your ink.

188
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,300
And over there, all your bits and bobs
for doing your wizardry.

189
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,299
It's a world-class racing broom.

190
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,499
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!

191
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,000
It's the fastest model yet.

192
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:47,299
But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this?
I haven't any money.

193
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,899
Well there's your money, Harry.
Gringotts, the wizard bank.

194
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:56,600
Tain't no safer place, not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.

195
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,199
Hagrid, what exactly
are these things?

196
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,699
They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come
goblins but not the most friendly of beasts.

197
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,900
Best stay close.

198
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,600
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.

199
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,000
And does Mr. Harry Potter
have his key?

200
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,200
Oh, Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.

201
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,799
Ha! Here's the little devil.

202
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,000
Oh, and there's something else as well.

203
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,500
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

204
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:02,700
It's about You-Know-What
in vault you-know-which.

205
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,900
Very well.

206
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,000
Vault 687.

207
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,200
Lamp, please.

208
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,000
Key, please.

209
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,200
Didn't think your mum and dad
will leave you with nothing, now did ya?

210
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,099
- Vault 713.
- What's in there, Hagrid?

211
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,499
Can't tell you, Harry.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.

212
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,400
Stand back.

213
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,500
Best not to mention this to anyone, Harry.

214
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,699
I still need... a wand.

215
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,400
A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.

216
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:59,300
Why don't you run along there and wait. I just
got one more thing I gotta do. Won't be long.

217
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,100
Hello?

218
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,900
Hello?

219
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,700
I wondered when
I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.

220
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,699
It seems only yesterday...

221
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:47,800
...that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.

222
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,800
Here we are.

223
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,900
Give it a wave.

224
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,900
Apparently not.

225
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,600
Perhaps...

226
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,400
...this.

227
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:42,000
No, no, definitely not.
No matter.

228
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,900
I wonder...

229
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,299
Curious.

230
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,399
Very curious.

231
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,800
Sorry, but what's curious?

232
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,799
I remember every wand
I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.

233
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,699
It so happens that the phoenix...

234
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:41,800
...whose tail feather resides
in your wand, gave another feather.

235
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,099
Just one other.

236
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,699
It is curious that you should
be destined for this wand...

237
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:55,700
...when its brother
gave you that scar.

238
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,800
And who owned that wand?

239
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,000
We do not speak his name.

240
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,899
The wand chooses
the wizard, Mr. Potter.

241
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,200
It's not always clear why.

242
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,999
But I think it is clear...

243
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,099
...that we can expect
great things from you.

244
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:23,599
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

245
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,499
...did great things.

246
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,800
Terrible...

247
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,500
...yes, but great.

248
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,200
Harry! Harry!

249
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,900
Happy birthday.

250
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,600
You all right, Harry?
You seem very quiet.

251
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:59,399
He killed my parents, didn't he?
The one who gave me this.

252
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,400
You know, Hagrid. I know you do.

253
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:11,699
First, and understand this Harry
because it's very important:

254
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,499
Not all wizards are good.

255
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,199
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...

256
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,399
...there was a one wizard who went as bad
as he can go. His name was V...

257
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,199
- His name was V...
- Maybe if you wrote it down?

258
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,299
No, I can't spell it.

259
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,800
- All right, Voldemort.
- Voldemort?

260
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,100
It was dark times, Harry. Dark times.

261
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,499
Voldemort started
to gather some followers.

262
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,100
Brought them over to the Dark Side.

263
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,600
Anyone that stood up to him
ended up dead.

264
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,699
Your parents fought against him.

265
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,800
But nobody lived once
he decided to kill them.

266
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,599
Nobody, not one.

267
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,300
Except you.

268
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,400
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

269
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,099
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut
on your forehead, Harry.

270
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:26,999
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse, and an evil curse at that.

271
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
What happened to V...?
To You-Know-Who?

272
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,399
Well, some say he died.

273
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,999
Codswallop, in my opinion.

274
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,499
Nope, I reckon he's out there still...

275
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,599
...too tired to carry on.

276
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:50,299
But one thing's absolutely certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.

277
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:54,800
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.

278
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
You're the boy who lived.

279
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
What are you looking at?

280
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,699
Blimey, is that the time?

281
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,899
Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his...

282
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:23,999
Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes.

283
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,600
Here's your ticket. Stick to it, Harry
that's very important. Stick to your ticket.

284
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,699
Platform 9 3/4?

285
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:39,699
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says platform 9 3/4.

286
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,300
There's no such thing, is there?

287
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,400
Sorry.

288
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,599
Excuse me. Excuse me.

289
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,399
Right on your left Madam.

290
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,399
Excuse me Sir, Can you tell me where
I might find platform 9 3/4?

291
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,099
9 3/4? Think you're being funny, do ya?

292
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,800
It's the same every year,
packed with Muggles, Of course. Come on!

293
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:23,600
- Muggles?
- Platform 9 3/4, this way.

294
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,400
All right, Percy, you first.

295
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,499
Fred, you next.

296
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,499
- He's not Fred, I am.
- Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother?

297
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,700
Oh, I'm sorry, George.

298
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,300
I'm only joking. I am Fred.

299
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,600
Excuse me.

300
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,399
Could you tell me how to...?

301
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,199
How to get onto the platform?
Not to worry, dear.

302
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,899
It's Ron's first time
to Hogwarts as well.

303
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:20,999
All you've got do is walk straight at the wall
between platforms 9 and 10.

304
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,800
- Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.
- Good luck.

305
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,499
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.

306
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,000
Not at all.

307
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,499
I'm Ron, by the way.
Ron Weasley.

308
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,400
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

309
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,699
So it's true!

310
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,800
I mean, do you really have the...?

311
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,300
- The what?
- The scar?

312
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,700
Wicked!

313
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,300
- Anything off the trolley, dears?
- No, thanks. I'm all set.

314
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,600
We'll take the lot.

315
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:22,200
- Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
- They mean every flavor.

316
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,899
There's chocolate
and peppermint and there's also...

317
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:29,899
...spinach, liver and tripe.

318
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:34,400
George sweared he got
a bogey-flavoured one once!

319
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,779
These aren't real
frogs, are they?

320
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:44,299
It's just a spell. Besides,
It's the cards you want.

321
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:50,100
Each pack's got a famous witch
or wizard. I've got about 500 meself.

322
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,900
Watch it!

323
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,800
Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only
got one good jump in them to begin with.

324
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,400
- I've got Dumbledore!
- I got about six of him.

325
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,699
Hey, he's gone!

326
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,400
Well, you can't expect him to
hang around all day, can you?

327
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,099
This is Scabbers, by the way.
Pathetic, isn't he?

328
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,499
Just a little bit.

329
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,999
Fred gave me a spell as
to turn him yellow. Want to see?

330
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,400
Yeah.

331
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,700
Has anyone seen a toad?

332
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,800
- A boy named Neville's lost one.
- No.

333
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,700
Oh, are you doing magic?
Let's see, then.

334
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,999
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow.

335
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,400
Turn this stupid fat rat yellow.

336
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:57,699
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it?

337
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,199
Of course, I've only tried
a few simple ones myself...

338
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,100
...but they've all worked for me.

339
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,800
For example:

340
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,900
Oculus Reparo.

341
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,600
That's better, isn't it?

342
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,699
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!

343
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,500
I'm Hermione Granger.
And you are...?

344
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:30,399
- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

345
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,800
You two better change into robes.
I expect we'll be arriving soon.

346
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,299
You've got dirt on your nose, by the way.
Did you know?

347
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,500
Just there.

348
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,599
Right, then.
First years, this way, please!

349
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:07,100
Come on, now, first years, don't be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.

350
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,000
- Hello, Harry.
- Hey, Hagrid.

351
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:22,500
Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on, now, follow me.

352
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,000
Wicked.

353
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,299
Welcome to Hogwarts.

354
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:44,499
Now, in a few moments, you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.

355
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:49,699
But before you can take your seats,
you must be sorted into your houses.

356
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:53,099
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...

357
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:57,800
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

358
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,300
Now, while you're here, your house
will be like your family.

359
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:07,299
Your triumphs will earn you points.

360
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:11,699
Any rule-breaking,
and you will lose points.

361
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:17,299
At the end of the year, the house
with the most points is awarded the house cup.

362
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,800
Trevor!

363
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,299
Sorry.

364
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,600
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.

365
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,200
It's true then,
what they're saying on the train.

366
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,199
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

367
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,900
Harry Potter?

368
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,099
This is Crabbe, and Goyle.

369
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,699
And I'm Malfoy.

370
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,400
Draco Malfoy.

371
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,799
Think my name's funny, do you?
I've no need to ask yours.

372
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:02,900
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.

373
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:07,799
We'll soon find out that some wizarding families
are better than others, Potter.

374
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,799
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

375
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,300
I can help you there.

376
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,300
I think I can tell the wrong sort
for myself, thanks.

377
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,200
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.

378
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:51,200
It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched
to look like the night sky.

379
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,500
I read about it
in Hogwarts: A History.

380
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,600
All right, will you wait along here, please?

381
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,699
Now, before we begin...

382
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,099
...Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.

383
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:23,200
I have a few start-of-term notices
I wish to announce.

384
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,699
The first years, please note...

385
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:31,999
...that the Dark Forest is
strictly forbidden to all students.

386
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,699
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

387
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:42,599
...that the third-floor corridor on the
right hand side is out of bounds...

388
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:47,200
...to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.

389
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,500
Thank you.

390
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:56,199
When I call your name,
you will come forth.

391
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:00,099
I shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...

392
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,499
...and you will be sorted
into your houses.

393
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,400
Hermione Granger.

394
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,300
Oh, no. Okay, relax.

395
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,000
Mental, that one, I'm telling you.

396
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:24,299
Ah, right then... hmm... right.

397
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:28,200
Okay. Gryffindor!

398
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,800
Draco Malfoy.

399
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,600
Slytherin!

400
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,299
There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad
who wasn't in Slytherin.

401
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,200
Susan Bones.

402
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,799
Harry, what is it?

403
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,799
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.

404
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,399
Let's see...

405
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,100
I know! Hufflepuff!

406
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,200
Ronald Weasley.

407
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:36,100
Another Weasley!
I know just what to do with you.

408
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,100
Gryffindor!

409
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,800
Harry Potter.

410
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,799
Hmm... difficult, very difficult.

411
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,899
Plenty of courage, I see.
Not a bad mind, either.

412
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,499
There's talent, oh, yes.

413
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:19,499
And a thirst to prove yourself.

414
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,000
But where to put you?

415
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,999
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

416
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,899
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?

417
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:33,899
You could be great, you know.
It's all here, in your head.

418
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:39,599
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatnesses, no doubt about that.

419
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:44,499
No? Well, if you're sure.

420
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,399
Better be...

421
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,700
...Gryffindor!

422
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:17,000
Your attention, please.

423
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,700
Let the feast begin.

424
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,099
I'm half and half.

425
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:43,599
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.

426
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,400
Bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out.

427
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:52,199
Say, Percy, who's that teacher
talking to Professor Quirrell?

428
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,499
Oh, thats Professor Snape,
head of Slytherin house.

429
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,699
- What's he teach?
- Potions.

430
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:03,600
But everyone knows, its the Dark Arts he fancies.
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.

431
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,399
Hello! How are you?

432
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,000
Welcome to Gryffindor.

433
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,600
Look, It's the Bloody Baron!

434
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,999
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?

435
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,700
Dismal. Once again, my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.

436
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,599
I know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.

437
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,499
I prefer Sir Nicholas,
if you don't mind.

438
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,300
"Nearly" headless?
How can you be nearly headless?

439
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,600
Like this.

440
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:08,399
Gryffindors, follow me please.
Keep up. Thank you.

441
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,999
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

442
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,299
This is the most direct path
to the dormitories.

443
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:21,000
Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases.
They like to change.

444
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:35,799
Keep up, please, and follow me.
Quickly now, come on. Come on.

445
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,699
That picture's moving.

446
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:42,500
- Look at that one.
- I think she fancies you.

447
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,499
- Oh, look! Look!
- Who's that girl?

448
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,400
Welcome to Hogwarts.

449
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,000
Password?

450
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,200
Caput Draconis.

451
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:21,800
Follow me, everyone. Keep up.
Quickly, come on.

452
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,000
Gather around here.

453
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,899
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

454
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:36,499
Boys' dormitory is upstairs and down to your left.
Girls, the same on your right.

455
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,900
You'll find that your belongings have
already been brought up.

456
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,699
Made it!

457
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:54,400
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?

458
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:02,499
- That was bloody brilliant!
- Thank you for that assessment, Mr Weasley.

459
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,974
Perhaps, lt'd be more useful
if I were to transfigure

460
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,999
Mr. Potter and yourself
into a pocket-watch.

461
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,399
- That way, one of you might be on time.
- We got lost.

462
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:16,500
Then perhaps a map? I trust you
don't need one to find your seats.

463
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:30,299
There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.

464
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:34,099
As such, I don't expect
many of you to appreciate...

465
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:38,099
...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

466
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:41,400
However, for those select few...

467
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:45,700
...who possess the predisposition...

468
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,499
...l can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...

469
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,699
...and ensnare the senses.

470
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,499
I can tell you how to bottle fame...

471
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:04,700
...brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.

472
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,499
Then again, maybe some of you have
come to Hogwarts in...

473
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:19,699
...possession of abilities so formidable that
you feel confident enough...

474
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,900
...to not pay attention.

475
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,500
Mr. Potter.

476
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,500
Our new celebrity.

477
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:44,500
Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

478
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,099
You don't know? Well, let's try again.

479
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:55,000
Where, Mr Potter, would you look
if I asked you to find me a bezoar?

480
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,699
I don't know, Sir.

481
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:01,800
And what is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane?

482
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,600
I don't know, Sir.

483
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,000
Pity.

484
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,900
Clearly, fame isn't everything...

485
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,499
...is it, Mr. Potter?

486
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:22,700
Clearly, Hermione knows.
Seems a pity not to ask her.

487
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:26,000
Silence.

488
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:39,100
Put your hand down,
you silly girl!

489
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,999
For your information, Potter...

490
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,669
...asphodel and wormwood
make a sleeping potion so

491
00:55:47,695 --> 00:55:50,599
powerful it is known as the
Draught of the Living Dead.

492
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:56,199
A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of
a goat and it will save you from most poisons.

493
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:03,100
As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same
plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.

494
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,900
Well...

495
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:12,300
...why aren't you all
copying this down?

496
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,599
And Gryffindors...

497
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:27,099
...note that five points will
be taken from your house...

498
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,700
...for your classmate's cheek.

499
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:52,800
Eye of rabbit, harp string hum
Turn this water into rum.

500
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,500
Eye of rabbit...

501
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,499
What's Seamus trying to do
to that glass of water?

502
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:03,500
Turn it into rum. Actually managed
a weak tea yesterday, before...

503
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:12,100
Mail's here.

504
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:47,400
Can I borrow this? Thanks.

505
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,399
Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall.

506
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:59,200
I've read about those. When the smoke turns
red, it means you've forgotten something.

507
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:02,899
The only problem is, I can't remember
what I've forgotten.

508
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:06,599
Hey Ron! Somebody broke into Gringotts.
Listen.

509
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:10,499
"Believed to be the work
of Dark wizards or witches unknown...

510
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:16,399
...Gringotts goblins while acknowledging
the breach, insist nothing was taken.

511
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:22,299
The vault in question, number 713, had, in fact,
been emptied earlier that very same day."

512
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:26,900
That's odd. That's the vault
Hagrid and I went to.

513
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:39,499
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

514
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,600
Good afternoon, Amanda.
Good afternoon.

515
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,199
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

516
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:50,399
Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step
up to the left side of their broomstick.

517
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:56,199
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand
over the broom and say, "Up."

518
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,399
Up!

519
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,600
Up.

520
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,900
Up.

521
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,199
Up. Up!

522
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,500
With feeling.

523
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,199
Shut up, Harry.

524
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:23,999
Now, once you've got hold of
your broom, I want you to mount it.

525
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,300
And grip it tight, you don't wanna be
sliding off the end.

526
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:33,599
When I blow my whistle, I want each of you
to kick off from the ground, hard.

527
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:37,599
Keep your broom steady,
hover for a moment...

528
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:42,199
...then lean forward slightly
and touch back down.

529
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,600
On my whistle. Three, two...

530
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,400
Mr. Longbottom.

531
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,799
- Mr. Longbottom!
- Down, down!

532
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,400
Neville!

533
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,800
Come back down this instant!

534
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,100
Everyone out of the way!

535
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,899
Is he all right?

536
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:49,900
Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist.
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.

537
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:55,799
Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground
while I take Mr Longbottom to the hospital wing.

538
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:59,599
Understand? If I see
a single broom in the air...

539
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:05,099
...the one riding it will find themselves out
of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch.

540
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,199
Did you see his face?

541
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,299
Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze,
he'd have remembered to fall on his fat arse.

542
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,100
Give it here, Malfoy.

543
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,600
No. I think I'll leave it somewhere
for Longbottom to find.

544
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,300
How about on the roof?

545
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:30,300
What's the matter, Potter?
Bit beyond your reach?

546
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:36,499
Harry, no way!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.

547
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:39,699
Besides, you don't even know how to fly.

548
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,900
What an idiot.

549
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,799
Give it here or I'll
knock you off your broom!

550
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,200
Is that so?

551
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,600
Have it your way, then.

552
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,899
- Nice going, Harry.
- That was wicked, Harry!

553
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:35,200
Harry Potter!

554
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:38,200
Follow me.

555
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,100
You wait here.

556
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:59,099
Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
Could I borrow Wood for a moment please?

557
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:01,200
Oh, yes, of course.

558
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:12,600
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
Wood, I have found you a Seeker.

559
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,199
Have you heard? Harry Potter's
the new Gryffindor Seeker.

560
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,700
I always knew he'd do well.

561
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:25,099
Seeker? But first years
never make their house teams.

562
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:29,799
- You must be the youngest Quidditch player in...
- A century, according to McGonagall.

563
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,599
Hey, well done, Harry.
Wood's just told us.

564
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,399
Fred and George are on the team too.
Beaters.

565
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,299
Our job is to make sure that you
don't get bloodied up too bad.

566
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:42,199
Can't make any promises, of course.
Rough game, Quidditch.

567
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:46,299
Brutal, But no one's died in years.
Someone will vanishes occasionally.

568
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:49,299
But they'll turn up in a month or two.

569
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:55,199
Oh, go on Harry. Quidditch is great. Best game
there is, and you'll be great too.

570
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,700
But I've never even played Quidditch.
What if I make a fool of myself?

571
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:03,900
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.

572
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:16,300
Harry, you never told me your father
was a Seeker too.

573
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,300
I didn't know.

574
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:28,299
I'm telling you, it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.

575
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:30,900
Who doesn't?

576
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,899
What's happening?

577
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:38,400
The staircases change, remember?

578
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:48,300
- Let's go this way.
- Before the staircase moves again.

579
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:59,299
Does anybody feel like
we shouldn't be here?

580
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:01,599
We're not supposed to be here.

581
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:05,900
This is the third floor.
It's forbidden.

582
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:08,600
Let's go.

583
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:13,700
- It's Filch's cat!
- Run!

584
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,800
Quick, let's hide through that door!

585
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:27,899
- It's locked!
- Thats it, We're done for!

586
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,400
Oh, move over!

587
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,500
Alohomora.

588
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,300
Get in.

589
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,499
Alohomora?

590
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,299
Standard Book of Spells,
chapter seven.

591
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:44,900
Anyone here, my sweet?

592
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:52,200
Come on.

593
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,499
- Filch is gone.
- Probably thinks this door's locked.

594
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:59,400
- It was locked.
- And for good reason.

595
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:30,499
What do they think they're doing? Keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school.

596
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:34,399
You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see
what it was standing on?

597
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,699
I wasn't looking at its feet!
I was a bit preoccupied with its heads.

598
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,799
Or maybe you didn't notice.
There were three!

599
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:45,699
It was standing on a trap door.
Which means it wasn't there by accident.

600
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:49,500
- It's guarding something.
- Guarding something?

601
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:53,599
That's right. Now, if you two don't mind,
I'm going to bed...

602
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:57,499
...before either of you come up with
another clever idea to get us killed.

603
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:00,900
Or worse, expelled.

604
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:08,400
She needs to sort out her priorities.

605
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:17,199
Quidditch is easy enough to understand.
Each team has seven players.

606
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:23,200
Three Chasers, two Beaters,
one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.

607
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,299
There are three kinds of balls.
This one's called the Quaffle.

608
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:38,499
Now, the Chasers handle the Quaffle and try
to put it through one of those three hoops.

609
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:42,999
The Keeper, that's me,
defends the hoops. With me so far?

610
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:47,800
I think so. What are those?

611
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,300
You better take this.

612
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,100
Careful now, it's coming back.

613
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:15,300
Not bad, Potter.
You'd make a fair Beater.

614
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:34,300
What was that?

615
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:38,699
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.

616
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:42,500
But you are a Seeker.

617
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:50,599
The only thing I want you
to worry about is this.

618
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:53,299
The Golden Snitch.

619
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:56,599
- I like this ball.
- You like it now.

620
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:00,799
Just wait. It's wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see.

621
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,899
What do I do with it?

622
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:06,399
You catch it.
Before the other team's Seeker.

623
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,099
You catch this, the game's over.

624
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:13,300
You catch this, Potter,
and we win.

625
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:27,599
One of a wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...

626
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:31,799
...or the ability to make objects fly.

627
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,499
Do you have your feathers? Good.

628
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:39,799
Now, don't forget the nice wrist
movement we've been practicing.

629
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,500
The swish and flick. Everyone.

630
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:49,700
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh, and enunciate.

631
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,700
Wingardium Leviosa.
Off you go, then.

632
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,199
Wingardium Leviosa.

633
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,800
Wingardium Leviosa.

634
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:08,799
No, stop, stop, stop! You're going
to take someone's eye out.

635
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:15,100
Besides, you're saying it wrong.
It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.

636
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:19,900
You do it then, if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.

637
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,200
Wingardium Leviosa.

638
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:37,299
Oh, well done! See here, everyone,
Miss Granger's done it!

639
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,200
Splendid!

640
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:43,000
Well done, dear.

641
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,300
I think we're going to need
another feather over here, Professor.

642
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:01,999
"It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."

643
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,700
She's a nightmare, honestly!
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

644
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,900
I think she heard you.

645
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,599
Where's Hermione?

646
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,899
Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't
come out of the girl's bathroom.

647
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:49,300
She said that she'd been in there
all afternoon, crying.

648
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:57,299
Troll! In the dungeon!

649
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:00,900
Troll in the dungeon!

650
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:06,100
Thought you ought to know.

651
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:15,800
Silence!

652
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:21,400
Everyone will please not panic!

653
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,599
Now...

654
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:28,400
...prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories.

655
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:33,900
Teachers will follow me
to the dungeons.

656
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:48,099
Gryffindors, keep up, please,
and stay alert.

657
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,999
How could a troll get in?

658
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,399
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.

659
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:59,700
- What?
- Hermione! She doesn't know.

660
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:15,100
I think the troll's left the dungeon.

661
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,100
It's going into the girl's bathroom.

662
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,500
Hermione, move!

663
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:02,000
Help! Help!

664
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:06,100
Hey, pea brain!

665
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,400
Help!

666
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:43,900
Do something!

667
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,300
- What?
- Anything!

668
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,299
- Hurry up!
- Swish and flick.

669
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,900
Wingardium Leviosa.

670
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,800
Cool.

671
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,999
Is it dead?

672
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,200
I don't think so. Just knocked out.

673
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,800
Troll bogies.

674
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,799
Oh, my goodness!
Explain yourselves, both of you!

675
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:58,700
- Well, what it is...
- It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

676
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,100
Miss Granger?

677
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:07,899
I went looking for the troll.
I'd read about them and thought I could handle it.

678
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:09,999
But I was wrong.

679
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:15,400
If Harry and Ron hadn't come
and found me, I'd probably be dead.

680
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:20,699
Be that as it may, it was
an extremely foolish thing to do.

681
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:26,599
I would've expected more rational behavior on your
part and am very disappointed in you, Ms. Granger.

682
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,799
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...

683
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:33,700
...for your serious lack of judgment.

684
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,999
As for you two gentlemen...

685
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,699
...l just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.

686
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:43,299
Not many first-year students
could take on a full grown mountain troll...

687
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:46,199
...and live to tell the tale.

688
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,900
Five points...

689
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,400
...will be awarded to each of you...

690
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:58,100
...for sheer dumb luck.

691
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:07,400
Perhaps you ought to go.
It might wake up.

692
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:21,100
- Good of you to get us out of trouble like that.
- Mind you, we did save her life.

693
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:25,899
Mind you, she might not have needed saving
if you hadn't insulted her.

694
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:29,500
What are friends for?

695
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:34,299
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

696
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:37,699
Ron's right, Harry.
You're gonna need your strength today.

697
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:40,200
I'm not hungry.

698
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:46,299
Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now
that you've proven yourself against a troll.

699
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:49,699
A little game of Quidditch
should be easy work for you.

700
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:53,100
Even if it is against Slytherin.

701
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:04,200
- That explains the blood.
- Blood?

702
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:08,699
Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...

703
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:11,499
...so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog.

704
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:14,499
But, he got himself bitten,
that's why he's limping.

705
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:17,100
But why would anyone go near that dog?

706
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:20,899
The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took
something out of one of the vaults.

707
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:24,299
He said it was Hogwarts business,
very secret.

708
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:25,699
So you're saying...

709
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:30,500
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.

710
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:47,600
- Bit early for mail, isn't it?
- But I never get mail.

711
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,700
Let's open it.

712
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,100
It's a broomstick.

713
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:06,000
That's not just a broomstick, Harry,
it's a Nimbus 2000!

714
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,500
But who...?

715
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:33,599
- Scared, Harry?
- A little.

716
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:37,499
That's all right. I felt the same way
before my first game.

717
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:41,299
- What happened?
- Er, I don't really remember.

718
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:44,099
I took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

719
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:47,300
Woke up in the hospital a week later.

720
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:12,699
Hello! Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Quidditch game of the season.

721
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:17,800
Today's game,
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!

722
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:50,399
The players take their positions
as madam Hooch...

723
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:54,399
...steps out onto
the field to begin the game!

724
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:58,000
Now, I want a nice, clean game...

725
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,100
...from all of you!

726
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:09,099
The Bludgers are up,
followed by the Golden Snitch.

727
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:11,999
Remember, the Snitch
is worth 150 points.

728
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,100
The Seeker who catches the Snitch
ends the game.

729
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:26,300
The Quaffle is released
and the game begins!

730
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:49,800
Angelina Johnson scores!
Ten points for Gryffindor!

731
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:56,300
Well done!

732
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:06,400
Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle.
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

733
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:41,200
Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

734
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:56,900
Give me that!

735
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Take that side!

736
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:23,700
What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?

737
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:34,699
It's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!

738
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:39,400
- Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
- Leave it to me.

739
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,700
Come on, Hermione!

740
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:20,600
Lacarnum lnflamarae.

741
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:30,700
Fire! You're on fire!

742
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:50,700
Go, go, go, go!

743
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:45,100
Looks like he's gonna be sick.

744
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:47,499
He's got the Snitch!

745
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:51,799
Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!

746
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,800
Gryffindor wins!

747
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:41,499
Nonsense! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

748
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:45,699
Who knows? Why was he trying
to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween?

749
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:48,299
- Who told you about Fluffy?
- Fluffy?

750
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:52,199
- That thing has a name?
- Of course he's got a name. He's mine.

751
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,795
I bought him off an lrish feller
I met down at the pub last year.

752
01:27:54,796 --> 01:27:56,651
Then I lent him to
Dumbledore to guard the...

753
01:27:56,652 --> 01:27:57,352
Yes?

754
01:27:57,425 --> 01:27:59,375
Shouldn't have said that.
No more questions!

755
01:27:59,376 --> 01:28:02,625
Don't ask any more questions.
That's top-secret, that is.

756
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:06,899
But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding,
Snape's trying to steal it.

757
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:10,800
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts teacher.

758
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:16,299
Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a spell when
I see one. I've read all about them.

759
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:20,099
You've got to keep eye contact,
and Snape wasn't blinking.

760
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:22,700
Exactly.

761
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,999
Now, you listen to me,
all three of you.

762
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,899
You're meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in. It's dangerous.

763
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:36,199
What that dog is guarding is strictly
between Prof. Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

764
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:37,900
Nicholas Flamel?

765
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:43,499
I shouldn't have said that.
I should not have said that.

766
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:47,799
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?

767
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:50,100
I don't know.

768
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:11,699
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas.

769
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:14,699
Ring the Hogwart bell.

770
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:17,699
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas.

771
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:21,000
Cast a Christmas spell.

772
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:37,900
Knight to e5.

773
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:47,800
Queen to e5.

774
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:54,800
That's totally barbaric!

775
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:58,899
That's wizard's chess.
I see you've packed.

776
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:00,600
I see you haven't.

777
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:06,099
Change of plans. My parents decided to go
to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie.

778
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:10,099
- He's studying dragons there.
- Good. You can help Harry, then.

779
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:13,699
He's going to go and look in the library
for information on Nicholas Flamel.

780
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:17,500
We've looked a hundred times!

781
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:23,400
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.

782
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:28,500
I think we've had
a bad influence on her.

783
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:35,400
Harry, wake up!
Come on, Harry, wake up!

784
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:48,499
- Happy Christmas, Harry.
- Happy Christmas, Ron.

785
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:51,000
What are you wearing?

786
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:55,300
Oh, my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.

787
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:58,800
- I've got presents?
- Yeah.

788
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:08,300
There they are.

789
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:22,799
"Your father left this
in my possession before he died.

790
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:27,200
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well."

791
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:47,699
- What is it?
- Some kind of cloak.

792
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:51,000
Well, let's see, then. Put it on.

793
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:57,599
My body's gone!

794
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:01,500
I know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak!

795
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:03,900
I'm invisible?

796
01:32:04,100 --> 01:32:08,800
They're really rare.
I wonder who gave it to you.

797
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:14,100
There was no name.
It just said, "Use it well."

798
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:47,899
Famous Fire-Eaters.
Fifteenth-Century Fiends.

799
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:54,100
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?

800
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,800
Who's there?

801
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:26,600
I know you're in there.
You can't hide.

802
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:37,700
Who is it? Show yourself.

803
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:26,200
Severus, I...

804
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:30,699
You don't want me
as your enemy, Quirrell.

805
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:35,700
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know perfectly well what I mean.

806
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:56,099
We'll have another little chat soon.

807
01:34:56,100 --> 01:35:01,799
When you've had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.

808
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:06,500
Professors. I found this
in the restricted section.

809
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:12,100
It's still hot. That means
there's a student out of bed.

810
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:46,000
Mum?

811
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:51,200
Dad?

812
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:31,000
Ron, you've really gotta see this!
Ron, you've gotta see this!

813
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:35,599
Ron, Ron, come on, get out of bed!

814
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:36,380
Why?

815
01:37:36,406 --> 01:37:39,525
There's something you've got to see.
Now, come on!

816
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:50,500
Come on! Come!
Come look, it's my parents!

817
01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:53,899
I only see us.

818
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:57,399
Look in properly.
Go on, stand there.

819
01:37:57,400 --> 01:38:03,600
- There. You see them, don't you?
- That's me! Only I'm head boy.

820
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:06,399
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.

821
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:10,900
And bloody hell!
I'm Quidditch captain too!

822
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:14,500
I look good.

823
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:18,799
Harry, do you think this mirror
shows the future?

824
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:24,100
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.

825
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:40,000
Do you like yours, Ron?

826
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:47,900
- Ron?
- I'll be right back.

827
01:38:57,400 --> 01:39:00,999
- Wanna play chess?
- No.

828
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:05,699
- Wanna go and visit Hagrid?
- No.

829
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:09,499
Harry, I know what you're thinking,
but don't.

830
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:13,700
There's something not right
about that mirror.

831
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:42,400
Back again, Harry?

832
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:47,899
I see that you,
like so many before you...

833
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:52,399
...have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.

834
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:56,900
I trust by now
you realize what it does.

835
01:39:57,900 --> 01:40:00,700
Let me give you a clue.

836
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,299
The happiest man on earth...

837
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:06,899
...would look into the mirror
and see only himself...

838
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:09,399
...exactly as he is.

839
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:14,699
So then, it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.

840
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:17,800
Yes. And no.

841
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:21,099
It shows us nothing more or less...

842
01:40:21,100 --> 01:40:27,299
...than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts.

843
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:32,299
Now you, Harry, who have
never known your family...

844
01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:36,299
...you see them standing beside you.

845
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:38,999
But remember this, Harry.

846
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:45,099
This mirror gives us
neither knowledge...

847
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:47,500
...or truth.

848
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:54,500
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.

849
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:59,599
That is why tomorrow
it will be moved to a new home.

850
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,800
And I must ask you...

851
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:06,700
...not to go looking for it again.

852
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:10,600
It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry...

853
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:14,000
...and forget to live.

854
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,300
Hi, Hedwig.

855
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:17,899
Look at you, playing with your cards.
Pathetic!

856
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:20,199
We've got final exams coming up soon.

857
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:22,999
I'm ready. Ask me any question.

858
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:27,499
Alright, what are the 3 most crucial ingredients
in a Forgetfulness Potion?

859
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:28,999
I forgot.

860
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:32,199
And what, may I ask, do you plan to do
if this comes up in the final exam?

861
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:34,499
- Copy off you.
- No, you won't.

862
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:37,444
Besides, according to Professor
McGonagall, we're to be

863
01:42:37,470 --> 01:42:40,599
given special quills bewitched
with an Anti-Cheating Spell.

864
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:47,200
That's insulting! It's as if they
don't trust us! Dumbledore again!

865
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:54,900
- Leg-Locker Curse?
- Malfoy.

866
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:03,100
You have got to start
standing up to people, Neville.

867
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:06,799
How? I can barely stand at all!

868
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:09,100
I'll do the countercurse!

869
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:13,599
No, that's all I need!
You to set my bloody kneecups on fire!

870
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:17,199
I don't appreciate
the insinuation, Longbottom.

871
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:20,599
Besides, if anyone cared to notice...

872
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:25,200
...my eyebrows have
completely grown back!

873
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:30,599
I found him!

874
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:35,999
"Dumbledore is particularly famous for his
defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945."

875
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:36,680
Go on!

876
01:43:36,706 --> 01:43:39,399
"For the discovery of the
twelve uses of dragon blood...

877
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:42,699
...and his work on alchemy with his
partner, Nicholas Flamel"!

878
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:46,299
I knew the name sound familiar.
I read it on the train that day.

879
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:48,900
Follow me!

880
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:56,400
Hey! Wait! Where are you going?

881
01:43:57,900 --> 01:44:01,500
What about the countercurse?

882
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:08,599
I had you looking in the wrong section.
How could I be so stupid?

883
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:11,899
I checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading.

884
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:14,200
This is light?

885
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:21,099
Of course! Here it is!

886
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:25,399
Nicholas Flamel is the only known
maker of the Philosopher's Stone.

887
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:26,800
The what?

888
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:30,399
Honestly, don't you two read?

889
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:35,099
"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers.

890
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:37,899
It'll transform any metal
into pure gold...

891
01:44:37,900 --> 01:44:42,199
...and produces the Elixir of Life
which will make the drinker immortal."

892
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:44,499
- lmmortal?
- It means you'll never die.

893
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:46,900
I know what it means!

894
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:52,399
"The only Stone currently in existence
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

895
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:57,900
...the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday."

896
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:01,699
That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor.

897
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:06,700
That's what's under the trap door.
The Philosopher's Stone.

898
01:45:22,876 --> 01:45:23,576
Hagrid.

899
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:27,199
Oh, hello, sorry, don't wish to be rude,
but I'm in no fit state to entertain today.

900
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:30,200
We know about the Philosopher's Stone.

901
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:36,642
We think Snape's
trying to steal it.

902
01:45:36,668 --> 01:45:39,899
Snape? Blimey, you're not
still on about him, are you?

903
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:43,000
Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone.
We just don't know why.

904
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:47,499
Snape is one of the teachers
protecting the Stone. He's not about to steal it.

905
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:48,799
What?

906
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:52,399
You heard. Right. Come on, now,
I'm a bit preoccupied today.

907
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:55,299
Wait a minute.
"One of the teachers"?

908
01:45:55,300 --> 01:45:59,399
Of course! There are other things
defending the Stone, aren't there?

909
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:02,299
- Spells, enchantments.
- That's right.

910
01:46:02,300 --> 01:46:05,499
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

911
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:07,799
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

912
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:11,699
Ain't a soul knows how,
except for me and Dumbledore.

913
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:15,600
I shouldn't have told you that.
I should not have told you that.

914
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:34,499
- Hagrid, what exactly is that?
- That? It's...

915
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:36,699
I know what that is!

916
01:46:36,700 --> 01:46:39,600
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?

917
01:46:39,700 --> 01:46:43,199
I won it. Off a stranger
I met down at the pub.

918
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:47,600
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it,
as a matter of fact.

919
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:12,000
Is that...

920
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:13,899
...a dragon?

921
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:18,499
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.

922
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:21,599
My brother Charlie works
with these in Romania.

923
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:26,800
Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.

924
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:29,199
Hello, Norbert.

925
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:33,800
- Norbert?
- Yeah, well, he's gotta have a name, don't he?

926
01:47:34,300 --> 01:47:37,000
Don't you, Norbert?

927
01:47:43,700 --> 01:47:47,100
He'll have to be trained up a bit,
of course.

928
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:53,100
Who's that?

929
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:56,900
Malfoy.

930
01:47:57,300 --> 01:47:59,000
Oh, dear.

931
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:05,499
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
He told me so the first time I met him.

932
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:09,699
It's crazy.
And worse, Malfoy knows.

933
01:48:09,700 --> 01:48:14,099
- I don't understand. ls that bad?
- It's bad.

934
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:16,600
Good evening.

935
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:23,099
Nothing, I repeat, nothing...

936
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:26,799
...gives a student the right
to walk about the school at night.

937
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:31,899
Therefore, as punishment for your actions,
50 points will be taken.

938
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:34,500
- 50?!
- Each.

939
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:37,799
And to ensure it doesn't happen again...

940
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:41,400
...all four of you
will receive detention.

941
01:48:42,100 --> 01:48:45,299
Excuse me, professor,
perhaps I heard you wrong.

942
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:47,799
I thought you said the four of us.

943
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:50,499
No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy.

944
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:55,800
You see, honorable as your intentions were,
you too were out of bed after hours.

945
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,200
You will join your classmates
in detention.

946
01:49:10,100 --> 01:49:14,299
A pity they let
the old punishments die.

947
01:49:14,300 --> 01:49:19,299
There was a time detention would find you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.

948
01:49:19,300 --> 01:49:22,400
God, I miss the screaming.

949
01:49:24,700 --> 01:49:28,199
You'll be serving detention
with Hagrid tonight.

950
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:33,800
He's got a little job to do
inside the Dark Forest.

951
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:38,800
A sorry lot, this, Hagrid.

952
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:45,300
Oh, good God, man, you're not still on
about that bloody dragon, are you?

953
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:49,600
Norbert's gone.

954
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:53,699
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania
to live in a colony.

955
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:57,099
Well, that's good, isn't it?
He'll be with his own kind.

956
01:49:57,100 --> 01:49:59,699
Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania?

957
01:49:59,700 --> 01:50:04,200
What if the other dragons are mean
to him? He's only a baby, after all.

958
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:10,099
Oh, for God's sake, pull yourself together, man.
You're going into the Forest, after all.

959
01:50:10,100 --> 01:50:12,599
Got to have your wits about you.

960
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:18,600
The Forest? I thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.

961
01:50:18,700 --> 01:50:22,900
Students aren't allowed.
And there are...

962
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:25,700
...werewolves.

963
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:29,299
There's more than werewolves
in those trees, lad.

964
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:32,300
You can be sure of that.

965
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:35,600
Nighty-night.

966
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:41,100
Right. Let's go.

967
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,599
Hagrid, what is that?

968
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:25,300
What we're here for.
See that?

969
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:31,200
That's unicorn blood, that is.
I found one dead a few weeks ago.

970
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:36,300
Now, this one's been hurt bad
by something.

971
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:49,499
So, it's our job to go
and find the poor beast.

972
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:52,900
Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.

973
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:56,600
And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.

974
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:00,099
Okay. Then I get Fang.

975
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:06,100
Fine. Just so you know,
he's a bloody coward.

976
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:14,699
You wait till my father hears about this.
This is servant's stuff.

977
01:52:14,700 --> 01:52:18,799
If I didn't know better, Draco,
I'd say you were scared.

978
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:21,700
I'm not scared, Potter.

979
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:24,800
Did you hear that?

980
01:52:27,100 --> 01:52:28,699
Come on, Fang.

981
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:30,500
Scared!

982
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:57,600
What is it, Fang?

983
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:13,399
Harry Potter, you must leave.
You are known to many creatures here.

984
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:17,599
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.

985
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:20,599
What was that thing you saved me from?

986
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:26,099
A monstrous creature.
It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.

987
01:54:26,100 --> 01:54:31,899
Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep
you alive even if you are an inch from death.

988
01:54:31,900 --> 01:54:37,199
But at a terrible price. You
have slain something so pure...

989
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:42,199
...that from the moment the blood touches
your lips, you will have a half-life.

990
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:44,199
A cursed life.

991
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:48,399
- But who would choose such a life?
- Can you think of no one?

992
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:53,699
Do you mean to say that
thing that killed the unicorn...

993
01:54:53,700 --> 01:54:57,799
...that was drinking its blood,
that was Voldemort?

994
01:54:57,800 --> 01:55:03,300
Do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment, Mr. Potter?

995
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:05,700
The Philosopher's Stone.

996
01:55:06,700 --> 01:55:09,000
Harry!

997
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:13,999
Hello there, Firenze.
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.

998
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,500
You all right there, Harry?

999
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:21,900
Harry Potter,
this is where I leave you.

1000
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:26,600
You're safe now. Good luck.

1001
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:38,299
You mean, You-Know-Who is out there
right now in the Forest?

1002
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:41,299
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.

1003
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:44,399
Don't you see? We had it wrong.

1004
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:48,999
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.
He wants the stone for Voldemort.

1005
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:53,699
With the Elixir of Life,
Voldemort will be strong again.

1006
01:55:53,700 --> 01:55:55,499
He'll come back.

1007
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:57,499
But if he comes back...

1008
01:55:57,500 --> 01:56:01,800
...you don't think he'll try
to kill you, do you?

1009
01:56:02,500 --> 01:56:06,299
I think if he'd had the chance,
he might have tried to kill me tonight.

1010
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:10,099
And to think, I've been worrying
about my Potions final.

1011
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:13,999
Hang on a minute.
We're forgetting one thing.

1012
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:19,200
Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?

1013
01:56:19,700 --> 01:56:24,999
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore
is around, Harry, you're safe.

1014
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:29,400
As long as Dumbledore is around,
you can't be touched.

1015
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:40,399
I'd always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams
were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.

1016
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:44,299
Speak for yourself.
All right there, Harry?

1017
01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:49,699
- My scar. It keeps burning.
- It's happened before.

1018
01:56:49,700 --> 01:56:52,599
- Not like this.
- Perhaps you should see the nurse.

1019
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:56,400
I think it's a warning.
It means danger's coming.

1020
01:57:03,700 --> 01:57:06,399
- Of course!
- What is it?

1021
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:10,299
Don't you think it's a bit odd that what
Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon...

1022
01:57:10,300 --> 01:57:13,599
...and a stranger turns up who
just happens to have one?

1023
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:16,499
I mean, how many people wander around
with dragon eggs in their pockets?

1024
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:19,100
Why didn't I see it before?

1025
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:28,099
Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg?
What did he look like?

1026
01:57:28,100 --> 01:57:30,999
I don't know, I never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.

1027
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,900
The stranger, though, You and he
must have talked.

1028
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:37,899
Well, he wanted to know what sort
of creatures I looked after.

1029
01:57:37,900 --> 01:57:42,099
I told him. I said, "After Fluffy,
a dragon's gonna be no problem."

1030
01:57:42,100 --> 01:57:46,900
- And did he seem interested in Fluffy?
- Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy.

1031
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:51,399
How often do you come across a
three-headed dog, even if you're in the trade?

1032
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:57,299
But I told him. I said, "The trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him."

1033
01:57:57,300 --> 01:58:03,000
Take Fluffy, for example. Just play him a bit of
music and he falls straight to sleep.

1034
01:58:04,300 --> 01:58:07,299
I shouldn't have told you that.

1035
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:09,800
Where are you going? Wait!

1036
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:19,600
We have to see Professor Dumbledore.
Immediately!

1037
01:58:19,700 --> 01:58:22,599
I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here.

1038
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:27,299
He received an urgent owl from the
Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.

1039
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:30,099
He's gone? Now?
But this is important!

1040
01:58:30,100 --> 01:58:32,600
This is about the Philosopher's Stone!

1041
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:38,200
- How do you know...?
- Someone's going to try and steal it.

1042
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:41,383
I don't know how you three
found out about the stone,

1043
01:58:41,409 --> 01:58:43,999
but I assure you it is
perfectly well protected.

1044
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:48,600
Now would you go back
to your dormitories? Quietly.

1045
01:58:56,600 --> 01:58:59,599
That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village.
It was Snape.

1046
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:02,499
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

1047
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:06,600
- And with Dumbledore gone...
- Good afternoon.

1048
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:11,699
Now, what would three young
Gryffindors such as yourselves...

1049
01:59:11,700 --> 01:59:16,300
...be doing inside on a day like this?

1050
01:59:20,700 --> 01:59:24,600
- We were just...
- You ought to be careful.

1051
01:59:24,900 --> 01:59:27,100
People will think you're...

1052
01:59:31,100 --> 01:59:34,100
...up to something.

1053
01:59:44,100 --> 01:59:46,299
Now what do we do?

1054
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:50,400
We go down the trap door. Tonight.

1055
02:00:03,900 --> 02:00:05,599
Trevor.

1056
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:09,299
Trevor, shh! go! You shouldn't be here!

1057
02:00:09,300 --> 02:00:14,899
Neither should you.
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?

1058
02:00:14,900 --> 02:00:19,099
- Now, Neville, listen. We were...
- No, I won't let you!

1059
02:00:19,100 --> 02:00:23,899
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.
I'll fight you.

1060
02:00:23,900 --> 02:00:28,600
Neville, I'm really really sorry about this.
Petrificus Totalus.

1061
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:40,299
You're a little scary sometimes,
you know that?

1062
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:44,200
Brilliant, but scary.

1063
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:46,799
Let's go.

1064
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:51,400
- Sorry.
- It's for your own good, you know.

1065
02:00:56,500 --> 02:01:00,800
- Ow! You stood on my foot!
- Sorry.

1066
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:06,700
Alohomora.

1067
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:21,200
Wait a minute. He's...

1068
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:24,600
...snoring.

1069
02:01:26,900 --> 02:01:32,700
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.

1070
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:37,300
It's got horrible breath.

1071
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:41,899
- We have to move its paw.
- What?

1072
02:01:41,900 --> 02:01:43,600
Come on!

1073
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:49,700
Okay. Push.

1074
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:16,399
I'll go first. Don't follow
until I give you a sign.

1075
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:21,700
If something bad happens,
get yourselves out.

1076
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:26,000
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

1077
02:02:26,300 --> 02:02:28,500
The harp.

1078
02:02:28,900 --> 02:02:31,900
It's stopped playing.

1079
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:43,000
Jump!

1080
02:02:56,900 --> 02:03:00,800
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.

1081
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:18,299
Stop moving, both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.

1082
02:03:18,300 --> 02:03:22,199
You have to relax. If you don't,
it will only kill you faster.

1083
02:03:22,200 --> 02:03:27,500
Kill us faster?
Oh, now I can relax!

1084
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:31,100
Hermione!

1085
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:35,399
- Now what are we gonna do?
- Just relax!

1086
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:40,200
- Hermione, where are you?
- Do what I say! Trust me.

1087
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:50,499
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1088
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:53,799
- He's not relaxing, is he?
- Apparently not.

1089
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:56,499
- We've gotta do something.
- What?

1090
02:03:56,500 --> 02:03:59,800
I remember reading something
in Herbology.

1091
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:04,399
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare.
It's deadly fun...

1092
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:08,999
...but will sulk in the sun!
That's it! Devil Snare hates sunlight.

1093
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,400
Lumus Solem.

1094
02:04:19,100 --> 02:04:22,000
- Ron, you okay?
- Yeah.

1095
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:27,200
Lucky we didn't panic.

1096
02:04:27,700 --> 02:04:31,400
Lucky Hermione pays attention
in Herbology.

1097
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:34,499
What is that?

1098
02:04:34,500 --> 02:04:38,500
I don't know. Sounds like wings.

1099
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:54,999
Curious. I've never seen
birds like these.

1100
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:58,899
They're not birds.
They're keys.

1101
02:04:58,900 --> 02:05:02,600
And I'll bet one of them
fits that door.

1102
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:10,700
- What's this all about?
- I don't know.

1103
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:18,600
Strange.

1104
02:05:18,700 --> 02:05:21,300
Alohomora!

1105
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,499
Well, it was worth a try.

1106
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:29,899
What're we going to do?
There must be a thousand keys up there.

1107
02:05:29,900 --> 02:05:34,099
We're looking for a big old fashioned one.
Probably rusty like the handle.

1108
02:05:34,100 --> 02:05:37,800
There! I see it!
The one with the broken wing.

1109
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:43,700
What's wrong, Harry?

1110
02:05:44,300 --> 02:05:45,999
It's too simple.

1111
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:50,899
Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape could catch it
on that old broomstick, you can.

1112
02:05:50,900 --> 02:05:54,800
You're the youngest Seeker
in a century.

1113
02:06:11,300 --> 02:06:14,600
This complicates things a bit.

1114
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:37,800
Catch the key!

1115
02:06:41,900 --> 02:06:44,200
Hurry up!

1116
02:07:16,300 --> 02:07:21,199
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

1117
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:24,700
Where are we? A graveyard.

1118
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:27,700
This is no graveyard.

1119
02:07:34,900 --> 02:07:38,100
It's a chessboard.

1120
02:07:49,800 --> 02:07:52,000
There's the door.

1121
02:08:03,800 --> 02:08:05,600
Now what do we do?

1122
02:08:05,700 --> 02:08:10,100
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got
to play our way across the room.

1123
02:08:10,400 --> 02:08:14,400
Alright. Harry, you take
the empty bishop's square.

1124
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:18,899
Hermione, you'll be
the queen-side castle.

1125
02:08:18,900 --> 02:08:23,300
As for me, I'll be a knight.

1126
02:08:30,100 --> 02:08:32,200
What happens now?

1127
02:08:32,700 --> 02:08:35,899
Well, white moves first.

1128
02:08:35,900 --> 02:08:38,000
And then...

1129
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:41,000
...we play.

1130
02:08:51,300 --> 02:08:56,599
Ron, you don't suppose
this is going to be like...

1131
02:08:56,600 --> 02:09:00,499
...real wizard's chess, do you?

1132
02:09:00,500 --> 02:09:03,800
You there, d5.

1133
02:09:18,100 --> 02:09:19,899
Yes, Hermione.

1134
02:09:19,900 --> 02:09:25,300
I think this is gonna be
exactly like wizard's chess.

1135
02:09:30,900 --> 02:09:33,700
Castle to e4!

1136
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,600
Pawn to c3!

1137
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:28,199
- Wait a minute.
- You understand right, Harry.

1138
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:33,200
Once I make my move,
the queen will take me.

1139
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:36,099
Then you're free to check the king.

1140
02:10:36,100 --> 02:10:39,100
- No. Ron, no!
- What is it?

1141
02:10:39,400 --> 02:10:44,299
- He's going to sacrifice himself.
- No, you can't! there must be another way!

1142
02:10:44,300 --> 02:10:48,299
Do you wanna stop Snape
from getting that Stone or not?

1143
02:10:48,300 --> 02:10:52,200
Harry, it's you that has to go on.
I know it.

1144
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:55,400
Not me. Not Hermione. You.

1145
02:11:05,400 --> 02:11:08,600
Knight to h3.

1146
02:11:29,200 --> 02:11:31,500
Check.

1147
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:02,399
Ron!

1148
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:08,500
No, don't move!
Don't forget, we're still playing.

1149
02:12:23,300 --> 02:12:24,800
Checkmate.

1150
02:12:44,500 --> 02:12:47,199
Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery.

1151
02:12:47,200 --> 02:12:51,299
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.

1152
02:12:51,300 --> 02:12:53,400
I have to go on.

1153
02:12:53,700 --> 02:12:59,799
You'll be okay, Harry.
You're a great wizard. You really are.

1154
02:12:59,800 --> 02:13:02,600
Not as good as you.

1155
02:13:03,100 --> 02:13:08,200
Me? Books and cleverness.
There are more important things.

1156
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:15,100
Friendship and bravery.
And, Harry, just be careful.

1157
02:13:52,900 --> 02:13:54,800
You?

1158
02:13:55,300 --> 02:13:59,399
No, it can't be.
Snape, he was the...

1159
02:13:59,400 --> 02:14:02,599
Yes, he does seem the type,
doesn't he?

1160
02:14:02,600 --> 02:14:05,999
Next to him, who would suspect...

1161
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:10,099
...poor, stuttering
Professor Quirrell?

1162
02:14:10,100 --> 02:14:15,699
But that day, during the Quidditch match,
Snape tried to kill me.

1163
02:14:15,700 --> 02:14:18,800
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!

1164
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:23,399
And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught
fire and broken my eye contact...

1165
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:25,799
...l would have succeeded.

1166
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:28,999
Even with Snape muttering
his little countercurse.

1167
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,399
Snape was trying to save me?

1168
02:14:31,400 --> 02:14:36,999
I knew you were a danger to me right from the off.
Especially after Halloween.

1169
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:41,399
- Then you let the troll in!
- Very good, Potter, yes.

1170
02:14:41,400 --> 02:14:44,700
Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.

1171
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:50,300
While everyone else was running about dungeon,
he went to the third floor to head me off.

1172
02:14:50,900 --> 02:14:54,700
He, of course, never trusted me again.

1173
02:14:55,400 --> 02:15:00,899
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.

1174
02:15:00,900 --> 02:15:05,099
I'm never alone. Never.

1175
02:15:05,100 --> 02:15:09,500
Now, what does this mirror do?

1176
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:13,200
I see what I desire.

1177
02:15:13,500 --> 02:15:18,099
I see myself holding the Stone.
But how do I get it?

1178
02:15:18,100 --> 02:15:20,600
Use the boy.

1179
02:15:21,100 --> 02:15:25,300
Come here, Potter! Now!

1180
02:15:37,100 --> 02:15:41,400
Tell me, what do you see?

1181
02:16:06,200 --> 02:16:08,899
What is it? What do you see?

1182
02:16:08,900 --> 02:16:14,199
I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the house cup.

1183
02:16:14,200 --> 02:16:16,100
He lies.

1184
02:16:16,300 --> 02:16:20,199
Tell the truth! What do you see?

1185
02:16:20,200 --> 02:16:24,799
- Let me speak to him.
- Master, you are not strong enough.

1186
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:29,100
I have strength enough for this.

1187
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:50,099
Harry Potter...

1188
02:16:50,100 --> 02:16:52,699
...we meet again.

1189
02:16:52,700 --> 02:16:54,299
Voldemort.

1190
02:16:54,300 --> 02:16:58,499
Yes. You see what I've become?

1191
02:16:58,500 --> 02:17:02,299
See what I must do to survive?

1192
02:17:02,300 --> 02:17:06,700
Live off another. A mere parasite.

1193
02:17:07,100 --> 02:17:10,599
Unicorn blood can sustain me...

1194
02:17:10,600 --> 02:17:14,499
...but it cannot give me
a body of my own.

1195
02:17:14,500 --> 02:17:18,299
But there is something that can.

1196
02:17:18,300 --> 02:17:24,200
Something that, conveniently enough,
lies in your pocket.

1197
02:17:24,300 --> 02:17:26,200
Stop him!

1198
02:17:30,900 --> 02:17:34,000
Don't be a fool.

1199
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:37,499
Why suffer an horrific death...

1200
02:17:37,500 --> 02:17:41,299
...when you can join me and live?

1201
02:17:41,300 --> 02:17:42,700
Never!

1202
02:17:44,400 --> 02:17:49,500
Bravery. Your parents had it too.

1203
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:53,499
Tell me, Harry...

1204
02:17:53,500 --> 02:17:57,599
...would you like to see
your mother and father again?

1205
02:17:57,600 --> 02:17:59,899
Together...

1206
02:17:59,900 --> 02:18:02,800
...we can bring them back.

1207
02:18:02,900 --> 02:18:07,900
All I ask is for something in return.

1208
02:18:14,300 --> 02:18:17,700
That's it, Harry.

1209
02:18:18,300 --> 02:18:22,399
There is no good and evil.

1210
02:18:22,400 --> 02:18:25,599
There is only power...

1211
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:30,000
...and those too weak to seek it.

1212
02:18:30,400 --> 02:18:35,800
Together, we'll do
extraordinary things.

1213
02:18:35,900 --> 02:18:38,400
Just give me the Stone!

1214
02:18:40,700 --> 02:18:42,099
You liar!

1215
02:18:42,100 --> 02:18:44,600
Kill him!

1216
02:19:07,800 --> 02:19:13,400
- What is this magic?
- Fool, get the Stone!

1217
02:20:58,400 --> 02:21:01,200
Good afternoon, Harry.

1218
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:07,699
- Tokens from your admirers?
- Admirers?

1219
02:21:07,700 --> 02:21:13,899
What happened down in the dungeons between
you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret.

1220
02:21:13,900 --> 02:21:19,000
So, naturally, the whole school knows.

1221
02:21:21,100 --> 02:21:24,899
I see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the trouble...

1222
02:21:24,900 --> 02:21:27,899
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

1223
02:21:27,900 --> 02:21:31,199
Ron was here? ls he all right?
What about Hermione?

1224
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:36,400
Fine. They're both just fine.

1225
02:21:36,600 --> 02:21:39,700
- What happened to the Stone?
- Relax, dear boy.

1226
02:21:39,800 --> 02:21:42,899
The Stone has been destroyed.

1227
02:21:42,900 --> 02:21:46,899
My friend Nicholas and I
have had a little chat...

1228
02:21:46,900 --> 02:21:51,499
...and agreed it was best all around.

1229
02:21:51,500 --> 02:21:55,600
But then, Flamel,
he'll die, won't he?

1230
02:21:57,300 --> 02:22:02,999
He has enough Elixir
to set his affairs in order.

1231
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:06,499
But yes, he will die.

1232
02:22:06,500 --> 02:22:09,099
How is it I got the Stone, sir?

1233
02:22:09,100 --> 02:22:11,899
One minute I was staring
in the mirror and the next...

1234
02:22:11,900 --> 02:22:16,299
You see, only a person...

1235
02:22:16,300 --> 02:22:20,399
...who wanted to find the Stone,
find it...

1236
02:22:20,400 --> 02:22:25,300
...but not use it,
would be able to get it.

1237
02:22:25,900 --> 02:22:29,699
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

1238
02:22:29,700 --> 02:22:35,000
And between you and me,
that is saying something.

1239
02:22:36,100 --> 02:22:41,599
Does that mean, with the Stone gone that is,
that Voldemort can never come back?

1240
02:22:41,600 --> 02:22:44,200
I'm afraid...

1241
02:22:45,300 --> 02:22:49,700
...there are ways
in which he can return.

1242
02:22:50,100 --> 02:22:52,899
Harry, do you know why...

1243
02:22:52,900 --> 02:22:57,099
...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear
to have you touch him?

1244
02:22:57,100 --> 02:23:02,000
It was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.

1245
02:23:02,300 --> 02:23:05,699
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

1246
02:23:05,700 --> 02:23:09,699
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.

1247
02:23:09,700 --> 02:23:14,900
- It lives in your very skin.
- What is it?

1248
02:23:15,500 --> 02:23:19,500
Love, Harry. Love.

1249
02:23:27,300 --> 02:23:31,599
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

1250
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:36,499
I was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit-flavored one.

1251
02:23:36,500 --> 02:23:39,999
And since then, I'm afraid,
I've lost my liking for them.

1252
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:43,599
But I think I could be safe...

1253
02:23:43,600 --> 02:23:46,300
...with a nice toffee.

1254
02:23:50,100 --> 02:23:51,900
Alas!

1255
02:23:52,300 --> 02:23:54,700
Earwax.

1256
02:24:09,700 --> 02:24:13,100
- All right there, Ron?
- All right. You?

1257
02:24:13,900 --> 02:24:17,000
All right. Hermione?

1258
02:24:17,300 --> 02:24:19,500
Never better.

1259
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,700
Another year gone.

1260
02:24:38,200 --> 02:24:42,899
And now, as I understand it,
the house cup needs awarding.

1261
02:24:42,900 --> 02:24:45,799
And the points stand thus:

1262
02:24:45,800 --> 02:24:51,900
ln fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.

1263
02:24:53,500 --> 02:24:59,500
Third place,
Hufflepuff with 352 points.

1264
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:06,499
In second place...

1265
02:25:06,500 --> 02:25:11,600
...Ravenclaw with 426 points.

1266
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:18,999
And in first place...

1267
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:24,800
...with 472 points, Slytherin house.

1268
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,600
Nice one, mate.

1269
02:25:36,100 --> 02:25:40,199
Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin.
Well done, Slytherin.

1270
02:25:40,200 --> 02:25:44,899
However, recent events must
be taken into account.

1271
02:25:44,900 --> 02:25:50,200
And I have a few last-minute points
to award.

1272
02:25:50,500 --> 02:25:56,199
To Miss Hermione Granger,
for the cool use of intellect...

1273
02:25:56,200 --> 02:25:59,300
...while others were in grave peril...

1274
02:25:59,700 --> 02:26:02,300
...50 points.

1275
02:26:02,900 --> 02:26:04,500
Good job.

1276
02:26:11,900 --> 02:26:18,200
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley,
for the best-played game of chess...

1277
02:26:18,500 --> 02:26:24,000
...that Hogwarts has seen
these many years, 50 points.

1278
02:26:28,300 --> 02:26:30,700
And third...

1279
02:26:30,900 --> 02:26:33,999
...to Mr. Harry Potter...

1280
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:38,600
...for pure nerve
and outstanding courage...

1281
02:26:38,900 --> 02:26:44,100
...l award Gryffindor house 60 points.

1282
02:26:52,100 --> 02:26:54,199
We're tied with Slytherin!

1283
02:26:54,200 --> 02:27:00,399
Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies...

1284
02:27:00,400 --> 02:27:04,499
...but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends.

1285
02:27:04,500 --> 02:27:07,699
I award 10 points...

1286
02:27:07,700 --> 02:27:11,200
...to Neville Longbottom.

1287
02:27:24,200 --> 02:27:27,899
Assuming that my calculations
are correct I believe...

1288
02:27:27,900 --> 02:27:32,700
...that a change
of decoration is in order.

1289
02:27:37,500 --> 02:27:41,100
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

1290
02:28:18,900 --> 02:28:22,399
Come on, now.
Hurry up, you'll be late.

1291
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:27,000
Train's leaving. Go on.
Come on, hurry up.

1292
02:28:32,100 --> 02:28:35,700
- Come on, Harry.
- One minute.

1293
02:28:41,700 --> 02:28:45,700
Thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye, did you?

1294
02:28:48,700 --> 02:28:50,800
This is for you.

1295
02:29:07,300 --> 02:29:09,700
Thanks, Hagrid.

1296
02:29:15,200 --> 02:29:19,900
Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh, listen, Harry.

1297
02:29:20,100 --> 02:29:24,799
If that dolt of a cousin of yours,
Dudley, gives you any grief...

1298
02:29:24,800 --> 02:29:27,699
...you could always threaten him...

1299
02:29:27,700 --> 02:29:30,699
...with a nice pair of ears
to go with that tail of his.

1300
02:29:30,700 --> 02:29:36,100
But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts. You know that.

1301
02:29:36,300 --> 02:29:40,900
I do. But your cousin don't, do he?

1302
02:29:46,100 --> 02:29:49,499
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

1303
02:29:49,500 --> 02:29:51,699
I'm not going home.

1304
02:29:51,700 --> 02:29:54,000
Not really.

1305
02:30:34,882 --> 02:30:40,879
Subtitles by Your Friend, awaqeded.
