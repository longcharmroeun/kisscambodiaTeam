1
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:26,950
I should've known that you would
be here, Professor McGonagall.

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.350
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.

3
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,849
Are the rumors true, Albus?

4
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:52,249
I'm afraid so, professor.
The good and the bad.

5
00:05:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.749
- And the boy?
- Hagrid is bringing him.

6
00:06:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.149
Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid
with something as important as this?

7
00:07:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.350
Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid
with my life.

8
00:08:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.249
Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor McGonagall.

9
00:09:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.349
- No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
- No, sir.

10
00:10:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.150
Little tyke fell asleep just
as we were flying over Bristol.

11
00:11:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.350
Try not to wake him.

12
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,250
There you go.

13
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:53,149
Albus, do you really think it's safe,
leaving him with these people?

14
00:14:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.649
I've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles, imaginable.

15
00:15:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.849
- They really are...
- The only family he has.

16
00:16:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.449
This boy will be famous. There won't be a child
in our world who doesn't know his name.

17
00:17:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.949
Exactly.

18
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,550
He's far better off growing up
away from all of that.

19
00:19:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.750
Until he's ready.

20
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:37,250
There, there, Hagrid.
It's not really goodbye, after all.

21
00:21:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.650
Good luck...

22
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,750
...Harry Potter.

23
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,350
Up. Get up!

24
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,550
Now!

25
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,550
Wake up, cousin!
We're going to the zoo!

26
00:26:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:52.050
- Here he comes, the birthday boy.
- Happy birthday, son.

27
00:27:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.949
Why don't you just cook the breakfast,
and try not to burn anything.

28
00:28:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.149
- Yes, Aunt Petunia.
- I want everything to be perfect...

29
00:29:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.249
...for my Dudley's special day!

30
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:10,550
- Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
- Yes, Uncle Vernon.

31
00:31:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.850
Aren't they wonderful, darling?

32
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,449
- How many are there?
- 36. Counted them myself.

33
00:33:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.849
36?! But last year...
last year I had 37!

34
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,431
But some of them are quite a
bit bigger than last year's.

35
00:35:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:05:26.432 --> 00:05:27.949
I don't care how big they are!

36
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,649
Oh, now, now, now. This is
what we're going to do...

37
00:37:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.350
...is that when we go out, we're going to buy
you two new presents. How's that, pumpkin?

38
00:38:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.950
It should be a lovely day at the zoo.
I'm really looking forward to it.

39
00:39:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.049
I'm warning you now, boy.

40
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,649
Any funny business, any at all...

41
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,050
...and you won't have
any meals for a week.

42
00:42:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.550
Get in.

43
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,150
Make it move.

44
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,449
Move!

45
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,149
- Move!
- He's asleep!

46
00:46:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.950
He's boring.

47
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,749
Sorry about him.

48
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,750
He doesn't understand
what it's like, lying there day after day...

49
00:49:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.150
...watching people press
their ugly faces in on you.

50
00:50:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.550
Can you hear me?

51
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:41,150
It's just, I've never talked
to a snake before.

52
00:52:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.949
Do you...?

53
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:47,350
I mean, do you talk to people often?

54
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,649
You're from Burma, aren't you?
Was it nice there?

55
00:55:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.250
Do you miss your family?

56
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:01,749
I see. That's me as well.
I never knew my parents either.

57
00:57:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:07.050
Mummy, Dad, come here! you won't believe
what this snake is doing!

58
00:58:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.049
Thanks.

59
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,850
Anytime.

60
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,050
Snake!

61
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,849
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

62
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,250
My darling boy!
How did you get in there?

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:06.850
Who did this? How did you get
in there? ls there a snake?

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:17.050
It's all right, sweetheart.
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.649
- What happened?
- I swear, I don't know!

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:25.750
One minute the glass was there and
then it was gone, it was like magic.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.950
There's no such thing as magic.

68
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,150
And smile!

69
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:53,449
Vernon, just look at him!
I can't believe it!

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.149
In just a week,
he'll be off to Smeltings.

71
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:00,149
Caveat Smeltonia.
Proudest moment of my life.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:03.550
Will I have to wear that too?

73
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,850
What? You? Go to Smeltings?

74
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,849
Don't be so stupid! You're going to go
to the state school. Where you belong.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:19.549
This is what you'll going to be wearing,
when I finish dyeing it.

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:24.049
That's Dudley's old uniform.
It'll fit me like bits of old elephant skin.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.649
It'll fit you well enough.

78
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:30,650
Go get the post. Go!

79
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,149
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

80
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,549
- Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
- Hey, give it back! It's mine!

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:09.550
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

82
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:45,450
No more mail through this letterbox.

83
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,950
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.

84
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,450
Shoo! Go on.

85
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:07,150
Fine day, Sunday.

86
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:12,449
In my opinion, best day of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:17.049
- Because there's no post on Sundays?
- Right you are, Harry!

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:20.150
No post on Sunday.

89
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,450
No blasted letters today! No, sir.

90
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,950
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!

91
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:43,250
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable...

92
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,950
Make it stop, please!

93
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,750
Stop it!

94
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,750
Mummy, what's happening?

95
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:15,550
Give me that! Give me that letter!

96
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,950
Get off!

97
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:27,850
They're my letters! Let go of me!

98
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,750
That's it! We're going away!

99
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,949
Far away, where they can't find us!

100
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:39,550
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

101
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,750
Make a wish, Harry.

102
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,850
Who's there?

103
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,450
Sorry about that.

104
00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:00,950
I demand that you leave at once, Sir!
You are breaking and entering!

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:06.650
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.

106
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:15,249
Mind, I haven't seen you
since you was a baby, Harry.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:20.049
But you're a bit more along than I would have
expected. Particularly 'round the middle.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:23.150
I'm not Harry.

109
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:28,750
- I am.
- Well, of course you are.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:30.949
Got something for you.

111
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:36,850
Afraid I might have sat on it at somepoint,
but I imagine it'll taste fine just the same.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:42.750
Baked it myself, words and all.

113
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,349
Thank you.

114
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:53,750
It's not every day that your young man
turns 11, now is it?

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:12.949
Excuse me, who are you?

116
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:18,149
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:22.150
- Of course, you know all about Hogwarts.
- Sorry, no.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:27.649
No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where
your mum and dad learned it all?

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:29.249
Learnt what?

120
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,050
You're a wizard, Harry.

121
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,249
- I'm a what?
- A wizard.

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:38.549
And a thumping good one, I'd wager,
once you're trained up little.

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:41.649
No, you've made a mistake.
I mean...

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.950
...l can't be a wizard.

125
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:50,350
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.

126
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:55,349
Well, Just Harry, did you ever
make anything happen?

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:16:55.350 --> 00:17:00.250
Anything you couldn't explain,
when you were angry or scared?

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:19.749
"Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to inform you...

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:23.149
...that you have been accepted at
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:28.349
He will not be going there! We swore when we
took him in we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:32.749
You knew? You knew all along
and you never told me?

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:36.049
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:39.949
My perfect sister being who she was.

134
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:46,149
My mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:50.549
"We have a witch in the family.
Isn't it wonderful?"

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:54.449
I was the only one to see her
for what she was.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:56.349
A freak!

138
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,549
Then she met that Potter,
and then she had you...

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:05.449
...and I knew you would be the same.
Just as strange, just as abnormal.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:10.649
And then, if you please, she went and got
herself blown up! And we got landed with you.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:14.949
Blown up? You told me
my parents died in a car crash.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:19.449
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:23.549
- We had to say something.
- It's an outrage! It's a scandal!

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:26.249
He'll not be going.

145
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,749
Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's
going to stop him, are you?

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.050
Muggle?

147
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:35,349
Non-magic folk. This boy's had
his name down ever since he were born.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:39.449
He's going to the finest school
of witchcraft and wizardry in the world and...

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:45.549
...he'll be under the finest headmaster that
Hogwarts has ever seen, Albus Dumbledore.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:50.549
I will not pay to have some crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:55.349
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...

152
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,650
...in front of me.

153
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:20,749
Oh, um, I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:25.150
- Strickly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.
- Okay.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:29.450
Ooh, We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:38.850
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.

157
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,750
"First year's students will require
three sets of plain work robes...

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:58.749
...one wand."

159
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,049
Essential bit of equipment, Harry.

160
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:07,049
"One pair of dragon hide gloves."
Hagrid, Do they mean from a real dragon?

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:10.550
They don't mean a penguin, do they?

162
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:15,750
- Crikey. I'd love a dragon.
- You'd like a dragon?

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:21.850
Vastly misunderstood beasts, Harry.
Vastly misunderstood.

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:31.049
"All students must be equipped with...

165
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:34,249
...one standard size 2
pewter cauldron...

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:40.249
...and may bring, if they desire,
either an owl, a cat or a toad."

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:43.049
Can we find all this in London?

168
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,750
If you know where to go.

169
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,349
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

170
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:15,449
No, thanks, Tom.
I'm on official Hogwarts business.

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:18.849
Just helping young Harry here
buy his school supplies.

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:22.650
Bless my soul.
It's Harry Potter!

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:30.349
Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:34.950
Doris Crockford, Mr Potter.
I can't believe I'm meeting you at last.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:40.549
Harry Potter. Can't tell you
how pleased I am to meet you.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:43.349
Hello, professor. 
I didn't see you there.

177
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:48,549
Harry, This is Professor Quirrell. He will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:51.249
Oh, nice to meet you.

179
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,449
Fearfully fascinating subject.

180
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:59,450
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?

181
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:04,449
Yes, well, must be going now.
Lots to buy.

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:06.450
Goodbye.

183
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:12,649
- See, Harry? You're famous.
- But why am I famous, Hagrid?

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:16.349
All those people back there,
how is it they know who I am?

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:20.450
I'm not sure I'm exactly the right person
to tell you that, Harry.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:41.250
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.

187
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,049
Here's where you'll get
your quills and your ink.

188
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:04,250
And over there, all your bits and bobs
for doing your wizardry.

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:31.249
It's a world-class racing broom.

190
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:35,449
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!

191
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:38,950
It's the fastest model yet.

192
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:47,249
But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this?
I haven't any money.

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:50.849
Well there's your money, Harry.
Gringotts, the wizard bank.

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:56.550
Tain't no safer place, not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:13.149
Hagrid, what exactly
are these things?

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:18.649
They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come
goblins but not the most friendly of beasts.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:20.850
Best stay close.

198
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:28,550
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.950
And does Mr. Harry Potter
have his key?

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:40.150
Oh, Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:45.749
Ha! Here's the little devil.

202
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,950
Oh, and there's something else as well.

203
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:53,450
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

204
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:02,650
It's about You-Know-What
in vault you-know-which.

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:05.850
Very well.

206
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,950
Vault 687.

207
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:18,150
Lamp, please.

208
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,950
Key, please.

209
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:55,150
Didn't think your mum and dad
will leave you with nothing, now did ya?

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:25:56.150 --> 00:26:00.049
- Vault 713.
- What's in there, Hagrid?

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:04.449
Can't tell you, Harry.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:06.350
Stand back.

213
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:37,450
Best not to mention this to anyone, Harry.

214
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:49,649
I still need... a wand.

215
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:53,350
A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:59.250
Why don't you run along there and wait. I just
got one more thing I gotta do. Won't be long.

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:19.050
Hello?

218
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,850
Hello?

219
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:31,650
I wondered when
I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:41.649
It seems only yesterday...

221
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:47,750
...that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:56.750
Here we are.

223
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,850
Give it a wave.

224
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:16,850
Apparently not.

225
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,550
Perhaps...

226
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:30,350
...this.

227
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:41,950
No, no, definitely not.
No matter.

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:50.850
I wonder...

229
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,249
Curious.

230
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:25,349
Very curious.

231
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:28,750
Sorry, but what's curious?

232
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:33,749
I remember every wand
I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:36.649
It so happens that the phoenix...

234
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:41,750
...whose tail feather resides
in your wand, gave another feather.

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:45.049
Just one other.

236
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:49,649
It is curious that you should
be destined for this wand...

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:55.650
...when its brother
gave you that scar.

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:00.750
And who owned that wand?

239
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,950
We do not speak his name.

240
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:07,849
The wand chooses
the wizard, Mr. Potter.

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:11.150
It's not always clear why.

242
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,949
But I think it is clear...

243
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:19,049
...that we can expect
great things from you.

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:23.549
After all, He
-Who
-Must
-Not
-Be
-Named...

245
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:26,449
...did great things.

246
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,750
Terrible...

247
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:32,450
...yes, but great.

248
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,150
Harry! Harry!

249
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,850
Happy birthday.

250
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,550
You all right, Harry?
You seem very quiet.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:59.349
He killed my parents, didn't he?
The one who gave me this.

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:03.350
You know, Hagrid. 
I know you do.

253
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:11,649
First, and understand this Harry
because it's very important:

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:14.449
Not all wizards are good.

255
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,149
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:22.349
...there was a one wizard who went as bad
as he can go. His name was V...

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:26.149
- His name was V...
- Maybe if you wrote it down?

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.249
No, I can't spell it.

259
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:32,750
- All right, Voldemort.
- Voldemort?

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:39.050
It was dark times, Harry. Dark times.

261
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:44,449
Voldemort started
to gather some followers.

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:48.050
Brought them over to the Dark Side.

263
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:52,550
Anyone that stood up to him
ended up dead.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:56.649
Your parents fought against him.

265
00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:00,750
But nobody lived once
he decided to kill them.

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:07.549
Nobody, not one.

267
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,250
Except you.

268
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:16,350
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

269
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:21,049
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut
on your forehead, Harry.

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:26.949
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse, and an evil curse at that.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:30.950
What happened to V...?
To You-Know-Who?

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:35.349
Well, some say he died.

273
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,949
Codswallop, in my opinion.

274
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:41,449
Nope, I reckon he's out there still...

275
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:44,549
...too tired to carry on.

276
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:50,249
But one thing's absolutely certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:54.750
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:58.950
You're the boy who lived.

279
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:10,950
What are you looking at?

280
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,649
Blimey, is that the time?

281
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:18,849
Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his...

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:23.949
Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:29.550
Here's your ticket. Stick to it, Harry
that's very important. Stick to your ticket.

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:34.649
Platform 9 3/4?

285
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:39,649
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says platform 9 3/4.

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:43.250
There's no such thing, is there?

287
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,350
Sorry.

288
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:07,549
Excuse me. Excuse me.

289
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,349
Right on your left Madam.

290
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:13,349
Excuse me Sir, Can you tell me where
I might find platform 9 3/4?

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:16.049
9 3/4? Think you're being funny, do ya?

292
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:19,750
It's the same every year,
packed with Muggles, Of course. Come on!

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:23.550
- Muggles?
- Platform 9 3/4, this way.

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:32.350
All right, Percy, you first.

295
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,449
Fred, you next.

296
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:47,449
- He's not Fred, I am.
- Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother?

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:49.650
Oh, I'm sorry, George.

298
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:56,250
I'm only joking. I am Fred.

299
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,550
Excuse me.

300
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:08,349
Could you tell me how to...?

301
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:12,149
How to get onto the platform?
Not to worry, dear.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:14.849
It's Ron's first time
to Hogwarts as well.

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:20.949
All you've got do is walk straight at the wall
between platforms 9 and 10.

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:24.750
- Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.
- Good luck.

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:26.449
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:28.950
Not at all.

307
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:34,449
I'm Ron, by the way.
Ron Weasley.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:37.350
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

309
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:40,649
So it's true!

310
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:43,750
I mean, do you really have the...?

311
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:47,250
- The what?
- The scar?

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:52.650
Wicked!

313
00:36:54,750 --> 00:37:00,250
- Anything off the trolley, dears?
- No, thanks. I'm all set.

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:06.550
We'll take the lot.

315
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:22,150
- Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
- They mean every flavor.

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:25.849
There's chocolate
and peppermint and there's also...

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:29.849
...spinach, liver and tripe.

318
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:34,350
George sweared he got
a bogey-flavoured one once!

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:40.729
These aren't real
frogs, are they?

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:44.249
It's just a spell. Besides,
It's the cards you want.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:50.050
Each pack's got a famous witch
or wizard. I've got about 500 meself.

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:53.850
Watch it!

323
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:59,750
Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only
got one good jump in them to begin with.

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:06.350
- I've got Dumbledore!
- I got about six of him.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:09.649
Hey, he's gone!

326
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:13,350
Well, you can't expect him to
hang around all day, can you?

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:17.049
This is Scabbers, by the way.
Pathetic, isn't he?

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:18.449
Just a little bit.

329
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:21,949
Fred gave me a spell as
to turn him yellow. Want to see?

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:24.350
Yeah.

331
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,650
Has anyone seen a toad?

332
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:35,750
- A boy named Neville's lost one.
- No.

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:40.650
Oh, are you doing magic?
Let's see, then.

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:45.949
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow.

335
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:49,350
Turn this stupid fat rat yellow.

336
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:57,649
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it?

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:01.149
Of course, I've only tried
a few simple ones myself...

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:04.050
...but they've all worked for me.

339
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,750
For example:

340
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,850
Oculus Reparo.

341
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:17,550
That's better, isn't it?

342
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:22,649
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!

343
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:26,450
I'm Hermione Granger.
And you are...?

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:30.349
- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:35.750
You two better change into robes.
I expect we'll be arriving soon.

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:43.249
You've got dirt on your nose, by the way.
Did you know?

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:45.450
Just there.

348
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:01,549
Right, then.
First years, this way, please!

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:07.050
Come on, now, first years, don't be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:16.950
- Hello, Harry.
- Hey, Hagrid.

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:22.450
Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on, now, follow me.

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:09.950
Wicked.

353
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,249
Welcome to Hogwarts.

354
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:44,449
Now, in a few moments, you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:49.649
But before you can take your seats,
you must be sorted into your houses.

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:53.049
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...

357
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:57,750
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

358
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:03,250
Now, while you're here, your house
will be like your family.

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:07.249
Your triumphs will earn you points.

360
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:11,649
Any rule-breaking,
and you will lose points.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:17.249
At the end of the year, the house
with the most points is awarded the house cup.

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:18.750
Trevor!

363
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:29,249
Sorry.

364
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:33,550
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:38.150
It's true then,
what they're saying on the train.

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:41.149
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

367
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,850
Harry Potter?

368
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:46,049
This is Crabbe, and Goyle.

369
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:48,649
And I'm Malfoy.

370
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:51,350
Draco Malfoy.

371
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:56,749
Think my name's funny, do you?
I've no need to ask yours.

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:42:56.750 --> 00:43:02.850
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:07.749
We'll soon find out that some wizarding families
are better than others, Potter.

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:11.749
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:14.250
I can help you there.

376
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:20,250
I think I can tell the wrong sort
for myself, thanks.

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:28.150
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:51.150
It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched
to look like the night sky.

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:54.450
I read about it
in Hogwarts: A History.

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:10.550
All right, will you wait along here, please?

381
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:14,649
Now, before we begin...

382
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:18,049
...Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:23.150
I have a few start-of-term notices
I wish to announce.

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:25.649
The first years, please note...

385
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:31,949
...that the Dark Forest is
strictly forbidden to all students.

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:37.649
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:42.549
...that the third-floor corridor on the
right hand side is out of bounds...

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:47.150
...to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:50.450
Thank you.

390
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:56,149
When I call your name,
you will come forth.

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:44:56.150 --> 00:45:00.049
I shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:03.449
...and you will be sorted
into your houses.

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:06.350
Hermione Granger.

394
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:11,250
Oh, no. Okay, relax.

395
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:14,950
Mental, that one, 
I'm telling you.

396
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:24,249
Ah, right then... hmm... right.

397
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:28,150
Okay. Gryffindor!

398
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:39,750
Draco Malfoy.

399
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:46,550
Slytherin!

400
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:50,249
There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad
who wasn't in Slytherin.

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:53.150
Susan Bones.

402
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:03,749
Harry, what is it?

403
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:06,749
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.

404
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,349
Let's see...

405
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:13,050
I know! Hufflepuff!

406
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:17,150
Ronald Weasley.

407
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:36,050
Another Weasley!
I know just what to do with you.

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:39.050
Gryffindor!

409
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:47,750
Harry Potter.

410
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:08,749
Hmm... difficult, very difficult.

411
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:12,849
Plenty of courage, I see.
Not a bad mind, either.

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:15.449
There's talent, oh, yes.

413
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:19,449
And a thirst to prove yourself.

414
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:21,950
But where to put you?

415
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,949
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

416
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:28,849
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?

417
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:33,849
You could be great, you know.
It's all here, in your head.

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:39.549
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatnesses, no doubt about that.

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:44.449
No? Well, if you're sure.

420
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:46,349
Better be...

421
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:48,650
...Gryffindor!

422
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:16,950
Your attention, please.

423
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:21,650
Let the feast begin.

424
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:40,049
I'm half and half.

425
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:43,549
Me dad's a Muggle. 
Mum's a witch.

426
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:47,350
Bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out.

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:52.149
Say, Percy, who's that teacher
talking to Professor Quirrell?

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:55.449
Oh, thats Professor Snape,
head of Slytherin house.

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:57.649
- What's he teach?
- Potions.

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:48:57.650 --> 00:49:03.550
But everyone knows, its the Dark Arts he fancies.
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:10.349
Hello! How are you?

432
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:13,950
Welcome to Gryffindor.

433
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:26,550
Look, It's the Bloody Baron!

434
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:33,949
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:39.650
Dismal. Once again, my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:49:42.350 --> 00:49:45.549
I know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:48.449
I prefer Sir Nicholas,
if you don't mind.

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:49:48.450 --> 00:49:52.250
"Nearly" headless?
How can you be nearly headless?

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:54.550
Like this.

440
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:08,349
Gryffindors, follow me please.
Keep up. Thank you.

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:12.949
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

442
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:16,249
This is the most direct path
to the dormitories.

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:20.950
Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases.
They like to change.

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:35.749
Keep up, please, and follow me.
Quickly now, come on. Come on.

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:38.649
That picture's moving.

446
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:42,450
- Look at that one.
- I think she fancies you.

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:46.449
- Oh, look! Look!
- Who's that girl?

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:50:46.450 --> 00:50:49.350
Welcome to Hogwarts.

449
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:06,950
Password?

450
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:10,150
Caput Draconis.

451
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:21,750
Follow me, everyone. Keep up.
Quickly, come on.

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:26.950
Gather around here.

453
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:31,849
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

454
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:36,449
Boys' dormitory is upstairs and down to your left.
Girls, the same on your right.

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:51:36.450 --> 00:51:39.850
You'll find that your belongings have
already been brought up.

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:49.649
Made it!

457
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:54,350
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:52:57.250 --> 00:53:02.449
- That was bloody brilliant!
- Thank you for that assessment, Mr Weasley.

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:04.924
Perhaps, lt'd be more useful
if I were to transfigure

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:06.949
Mr. Potter and yourself
into a pocket-watch.

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:10.349
- That way, one of you might be on time.
- We got lost.

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:16.450
Then perhaps a map? I trust you
don't need one to find your seats.

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:30.249
There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:53:30.250 --> 00:53:34.049
As such, I don't expect
many of you to appreciate...

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:38.049
...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:41.350
However, for those select few...

467
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:45,650
...who possess the predisposition...

468
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:52,449
...l can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:53:52.450 --> 00:53:55.649
...and ensnare the senses.

470
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:58,449
I can tell you how to bottle fame...

471
00:53:58,450 --> 00:54:04,650
...brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:54:08.350 --> 00:54:13.449
Then again, maybe some of you have
come to Hogwarts in...

473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:19.649
...possession of abilities so formidable that
you feel confident enough...

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:22.850
...to not pay attention.

475
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:31,450
Mr. Potter.

476
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:36,450
Our new celebrity.

477
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:44,450
Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:50.049
You don't know? 
Well, let's try again.

479
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:54,950
Where, Mr Potter, would you look
if I asked you to find me a bezoar?

480
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:54:55.950 --> 00:54:57.649
I don't know, Sir.

481
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:01,750
And what is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane?

482
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:06.550
I don't know, Sir.

483
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:08,950
Pity.

484
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:14,850
Clearly, fame isn't everything...

485
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:17,449
...is it, Mr. Potter?

486
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:22,650
Clearly, Hermione knows.
Seems a pity not to ask her.

487
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:55:23.050 --> 00:55:25.950
Silence.

488
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:39,050
Put your hand down,
you silly girl!

489
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:44.949
For your information, Potter...

490
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:47,619
...asphodel and wormwood
make a sleeping potion so

491
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:55:47.645 --> 00:55:50.549
powerful it is known as the
Draught of the Living Dead.

492
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:56.149
A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of
a goat and it will save you from most poisons.

493
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:55:56.150 --> 00:56:03.050
As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same
plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.

494
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:06.850
Well...

495
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:12,250
...why aren't you all
copying this down?

496
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:56:19.850 --> 00:56:22.549
And Gryffindors...

497
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:27,049
...note that five points will
be taken from your house...

498
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:29.650
...for your classmate's cheek.

499
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:52,750
Eye of rabbit, harp string hum
Turn this water into rum.

500
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:55.450
Eye of rabbit...

501
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:58,449
What's Seamus trying to do
to that glass of water?

502
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:56:58.450 --> 00:57:03.450
Turn it into rum. Actually managed
a weak tea yesterday, before...

503
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:12.050
Mail's here.

504
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:47,350
Can I borrow this? Thanks.

505
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:53,349
Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall.

506
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:59,150
I've read about those. When the smoke turns
red, it means you've forgotten something.

507
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:02.849
The only problem is, I can't remember
what I've forgotten.

508
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:58:02.850 --> 00:58:06.549
Hey Ron! Somebody broke into Gringotts.
Listen.

509
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:58:06.550 --> 00:58:10.449
"Believed to be the work
of Dark wizards or witches unknown...

510
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:58:10.450 --> 00:58:16.349
...Gringotts goblins while acknowledging
the breach, insist nothing was taken.

511
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:58:16.350 --> 00:58:22.249
The vault in question, number 713, had, in fact,
been emptied earlier that very same day."

512
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:26.850
That's odd. That's the vault
Hagrid and I went to.

513
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:39.449
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

514
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:58:39.450 --> 00:58:42.550
Good afternoon, Amanda.
Good afternoon.

515
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:58:43.550 --> 00:58:46.149
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

516
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:50,349
Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step
up to the left side of their broomstick.

517
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:58:50.350 --> 00:58:56.149
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand
over the broom and say, "Up."

518
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:58.349
Up!

519
00:58:58,350 --> 00:58:59,550
Up.

520
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:02,850
Up.

521
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:06,149
Up. Up!

522
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:08,450
With feeling.

523
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:19,149
Shut up, Harry.

524
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:23,949
Now, once you've got hold of
your broom, I want you to mount it.

525
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:28.250
And grip it tight, you don't wanna be
sliding off the end.

526
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:33.549
When I blow my whistle, I want each of you
to kick off from the ground, hard.

527
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:59:33.550 --> 00:59:37.549
Keep your broom steady,
hover for a moment...

528
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:59:37.550 --> 00:59:42.149
...then lean forward slightly
and touch back down.

529
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:45.550
On my whistle. Three, two...

530
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,350
Mr. Longbottom.

531
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:56,749
- Mr. Longbottom!
- Down, down!

532
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:58.350
Neville!

533
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:04,750
Come back down this instant!

534
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:36,050
Everyone out of the way!

535
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:43,849
Is he all right?

536
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:49,850
Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist.
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.

537
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:00:50.850 --> 01:00:55.749
Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground
while I take Mr Longbottom to the hospital wing.

538
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:59.549
Understand? If I see
a single broom in the air...

539
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:00:59.550 --> 01:01:05.049
...the one riding it will find themselves out
of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch.

540
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:01:05.050 --> 01:01:07.149
Did you see his face?

541
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:11,249
Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze,
he'd have remembered to fall on his fat arse.

542
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:14.050
Give it here, Malfoy.

543
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:18,550
No. I think I'll leave it somewhere
for Longbottom to find.

544
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:01:22.450 --> 01:01:25.250
How about on the roof?

545
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:30,250
What's the matter, Potter?
Bit beyond your reach?

546
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:36.449
Harry, no way!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.

547
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:01:36.450 --> 01:01:39.649
Besides, you don't even know how to fly.

548
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:41,850
What an idiot.

549
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:48,749
Give it here or I'll
knock you off your broom!

550
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:51.150
Is that so?

551
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:56,550
Have it your way, then.

552
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:32,849
- Nice going, Harry.
- That was wicked, Harry!

553
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:35.150
Harry Potter!

554
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:38,150
Follow me.

555
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:52,050
You wait here.

556
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:59,049
Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
Could I borrow Wood for a moment please?

557
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:02:59.050 --> 01:03:01.150
Oh, yes, of course.

558
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:12,550
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
Wood, I have found you a Seeker.

559
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:03:14.350 --> 01:03:18.149
Have you heard? Harry Potter's
the new Gryffindor Seeker.

560
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:20.650
I always knew he'd do well.

561
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:25,049
Seeker? But first years
never make their house teams.

562
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:29.749
- You must be the youngest Quidditch player in...
- A century, according to McGonagall.

563
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:32.549
Hey, well done, Harry.
Wood's just told us.

564
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:03:32.550 --> 01:03:35.349
Fred and George are on the team too.
Beaters.

565
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:03:35.350 --> 01:03:39.249
Our job is to make sure that you
don't get bloodied up too bad.

566
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:42.149
Can't make any promises, of course.
Rough game, Quidditch.

567
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:46.249
Brutal, But no one's died in years.
Someone will vanishes occasionally.

568
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:49.249
But they'll turn up
in a month or two.

569
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:55,149
Oh, go on Harry. Quidditch is great. Best game
there is, and you'll be great too.

570
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:03:55.150 --> 01:03:58.650
But I've never even played Quidditch.
What if I make a fool of myself?

571
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:03:58.750 --> 01:04:03.850
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.

572
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:04:11.050 --> 01:04:16.250
Harry, you never told me your father
was a Seeker too.

573
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:19.250
I didn't know.

574
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:28,249
I'm telling you, it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.

575
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:30.850
Who doesn't?

576
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:33,849
What's happening?

577
01:04:33,850 --> 01:04:38,350
The staircases change, remember?

578
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:48,250
- Let's go this way.
- Before the staircase moves again.

579
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:04:55.550 --> 01:04:59.249
Does anybody feel like
we shouldn't be here?

580
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:04:59.250 --> 01:05:01.549
We're not supposed to be here.

581
01:05:01,550 --> 01:05:05,850
This is the third floor.
It's forbidden.

582
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:08.550
Let's go.

583
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:13,650
- It's Filch's cat!
- Run!

584
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:20.750
Quick, let's hide through that door!

585
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:27,849
- It's locked!
- Thats it, We're done for!

586
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:30.350
Oh, move over!

587
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:33,450
Alohomora.

588
01:05:33,950 --> 01:05:36,250
Get in.

589
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:38,449
Alohomora?

590
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:41,249
Standard Book of Spells,
chapter seven.

591
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:44.850
Anyone here, my sweet?

592
01:05:50,850 --> 01:05:52,150
Come on.

593
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:55,449
- Filch is gone.
- Probably thinks this door's locked.

594
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:05:55.450 --> 01:05:59.350
- It was locked.
- And for good reason.

595
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:30.449
What do they think they're doing? Keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school.

596
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:06:30.450 --> 01:06:34.349
You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see
what it was standing on?

597
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:06:34.350 --> 01:06:38.649
I wasn't looking at its feet!
I was a bit preoccupied with its heads.

598
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:06:38.650 --> 01:06:41.749
Or maybe you didn't notice.
There were three!

599
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:45.649
It was standing on a trap door.
Which means it wasn't there by accident.

600
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:49.450
- It's guarding something.
- Guarding something?

601
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:06:49.650 --> 01:06:53.549
That's right. Now, if you two don't mind,
I'm going to bed...

602
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:06:53.550 --> 01:06:57.449
...before either of you come up with
another clever idea to get us killed.

603
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:06:57.450 --> 01:07:00.850
Or worse, expelled.

604
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:08,350
She needs to sort out her priorities.

605
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:17,149
Quidditch is easy enough to understand.
Each team has seven players.

606
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:23.150
Three Chasers, two Beaters,
one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.

607
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:32.249
There are three kinds of balls.
This one's called the Quaffle.

608
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:07:32.250 --> 01:07:38.449
Now, the Chasers handle the Quaffle and try
to put it through one of those three hoops.

609
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:07:38.450 --> 01:07:42.949
The Keeper, that's me,
defends the hoops. With me so far?

610
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:47.750
I think so. What are those?

611
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:52,250
You better take this.

612
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:05,050
Careful now, it's coming back.

613
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:15,250
Not bad, Potter.
You'd make a fair Beater.

614
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:08:31.650 --> 01:08:34.250
What was that?

615
01:08:34,650 --> 01:08:38,649
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.

616
01:08:38,650 --> 01:08:42,450
But you are a Seeker.

617
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:50,549
The only thing I want you
to worry about is this.

618
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:53.249
The Golden Snitch.

619
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:56,549
- I like this ball.
- You like it now.

620
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:08:56.550 --> 01:09:00.749
Just wait. It's wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see.

621
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:09:00.750 --> 01:09:02.849
What do I do with it?

622
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:06,349
You catch it.
Before the other team's Seeker.

623
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:09.049
You catch this, the game's over.

624
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:13,250
You catch this, Potter,
and we win.

625
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:09:22.050 --> 01:09:27.549
One of a wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...

626
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:31.749
...or the ability to make objects fly.

627
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:34,449
Do you have your feathers? Good.

628
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:39,749
Now, don't forget the nice wrist
movement we've been practicing.

629
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:43.450
The swish and flick. Everyone.

630
01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:49,650
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh, and enunciate.

631
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:54.650
Wingardium Leviosa.
Off you go, then.

632
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:58.149
Wingardium Leviosa.

633
01:09:58,150 --> 01:10:00,750
Wingardium Leviosa.

634
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:08,749
No, stop, stop, stop! You're going
to take someone's eye out.

635
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:15.050
Besides, you're saying it wrong.
It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.

636
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:19.850
You do it then, if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.

637
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:24.150
Wingardium Leviosa.

638
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:37,249
Oh, well done! See here, everyone,
Miss Granger's done it!

639
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:39.150
Splendid!

640
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:42,950
Well done, dear.

641
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:51,250
I think we're going to need
another feather over here, Professor.

642
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:10:57.450 --> 01:11:01.949
"It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."

643
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:07,650
She's a nightmare, honestly!
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

644
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:11:07.950 --> 01:11:10.850
I think she heard you.

645
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:41,549
Where's Hermione?

646
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:44,849
Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't
come out of the girl's bathroom.

647
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:11:44.850 --> 01:11:49.250
She said that she'd been in there
all afternoon, crying.

648
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:57.249
Troll! In the dungeon!

649
01:11:57,250 --> 01:12:00,850
Troll in the dungeon!

650
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:06,050
Thought you ought to know.

651
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:15,750
Silence!

652
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:21,350
Everyone will please not panic!

653
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:23,549
Now...

654
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:28,350
...prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories.

655
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:33.850
Teachers will follow me
to the dungeons.

656
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:12:44.650 --> 01:12:48.049
Gryffindors, keep up, please,
and stay alert.

657
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:12:48.050 --> 01:12:49.949
How could a troll get in?

658
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:55,349
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.

659
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:59.650
- What?
- Hermione! She doesn't know.

660
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:15.050
I think the troll's left the dungeon.

661
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:21,050
It's going into the girl's bathroom.

662
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:54,450
Hermione, move!

663
01:13:57,550 --> 01:14:01,950
Help! Help!

664
01:14:03,650 --> 01:14:06,050
Hey, pea brain!

665
01:14:18,150 --> 01:14:20,350
Help!

666
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:43,850
Do something!

667
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:49,250
- What?
- Anything!

668
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:52.249
- Hurry up!
- Swish and flick.

669
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:54.850
Wingardium Leviosa.

670
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:07,750
Cool.

671
01:15:31,850 --> 01:15:34,949
Is it dead?

672
01:15:34,950 --> 01:15:39,150
I don't think so. 
Just knocked out.

673
01:15:45,150 --> 01:15:47,750
Troll bogies.

674
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:53,749
Oh, my goodness!
Explain yourselves, both of you!

675
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:58.650
- Well, what it is...
- It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

676
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:02.050
Miss Granger?

677
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:07,849
I went looking for the troll.
I'd read about them and thought I could handle it.

678
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:16:07.850 --> 01:16:09.949
But I was wrong.

679
01:16:09,950 --> 01:16:15,350
If Harry and Ron hadn't come
and found me, I'd probably be dead.

680
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:16:16.050 --> 01:16:20.649
Be that as it may, it was
an extremely foolish thing to do.

681
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:16:20.650 --> 01:16:26.549
I would've expected more rational behavior on your
part and am very disappointed in you, Ms. Granger.

682
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:16:26.550 --> 01:16:29.749
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...

683
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:33.650
...for your serious lack of judgment.

684
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:35,949
As for you two gentlemen...

685
01:16:35,950 --> 01:16:39,649
...l just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.

686
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:16:39.650 --> 01:16:43.249
Not many first-year students
could take on a full grown mountain troll...

687
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:46.149
...and live to tell the tale.

688
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:48,850
Five points...

689
01:16:49,950 --> 01:16:53,350
...will be awarded to each of you...

690
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:58,050
...for sheer dumb luck.

691
01:17:03,350 --> 01:17:07,350
Perhaps you ought to go.
It might wake up.

692
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:17:16.450 --> 01:17:21.050
- Good of you to get us out of trouble like that.
- Mind you, we did save her life.

693
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:17:21.250 --> 01:17:25.849
Mind you, she might not have needed saving
if you hadn't insulted her.

694
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:29.450
What are friends for?

695
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:34,249
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

696
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:37,649
Ron's right, Harry.
You're gonna need your strength today.

697
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:17:37.650 --> 01:17:40.150
I'm not hungry.

698
01:17:40,450 --> 01:17:46,249
Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now
that you've proven yourself against a troll.

699
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:49.649
A little game of Quidditch
should be easy work for you.

700
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:17:49.650 --> 01:17:53.050
Even if it is against Slytherin.

701
01:18:00,450 --> 01:18:04,150
- That explains the blood.
- Blood?

702
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:08.649
Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...

703
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:11.449
...so he could try and
get past that 3 headed dog.

704
01:18:11,450 --> 01:18:14,449
But, he got himself bitten,
that's why he's limping.

705
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:18:14.450 --> 01:18:17.050
But why would anyone go near that dog?

706
01:18:17,350 --> 01:18:20,849
The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took
something out of one of the vaults.

707
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:18:20.850 --> 01:18:24.249
He said it was Hogwarts business,
very secret.

708
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:18:24.250 --> 01:18:25.649
So you're saying...

709
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:30,450
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.

710
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:47.550
- Bit early for mail, isn't it?
- But I never get mail.

711
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:49.650
Let's open it.

712
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:01,050
It's a broomstick.

713
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:05,950
That's not just a broomstick, Harry,
it's a Nimbus 2000!

714
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:19:07.150 --> 01:19:09.450
But who...?

715
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:33,549
- Scared, Harry?
- A little.

716
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:37.449
That's all right. I felt the same way
before my first game.

717
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:19:37.450 --> 01:19:41.249
- What happened?
- Er, I don't really remember.

718
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:19:41.250 --> 01:19:44.049
I took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

719
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:19:44.050 --> 01:19:47.250
Woke up in the hospital a week later.

720
01:20:09,150 --> 01:20:12,649
Hello! Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Quidditch game of the season.

721
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:20:12.650 --> 01:20:17.750
Today's game,
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!

722
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:20:47.650 --> 01:20:50.349
The players take their positions
as madam Hooch...

723
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:20:50.350 --> 01:20:54.349
...steps out onto
the field to begin the game!

724
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:57.950
Now, I want a nice, clean game...

725
01:20:58,350 --> 01:21:01,050
...from all of you!

726
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:09,049
The Bludgers are up,
followed by the Golden Snitch.

727
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:21:09.050 --> 01:21:11.949
Remember, the Snitch
is worth 150 points.

728
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:16.050
The Seeker who catches the Snitch
ends the game.

729
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:21:21.850 --> 01:21:26.250
The Quaffle is released
and the game begins!

730
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:21:44.650 --> 01:21:49.750
Angelina Johnson scores!
Ten points for Gryffindor!

731
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:21:54.650 --> 01:21:56.250
Well done!

732
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:06,350
Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle.
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

733
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:22:38.050 --> 01:22:41.150
Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

734
01:22:54,650 --> 01:22:56,850
Give me that!

735
01:23:27,950 --> 01:23:30,950
Take that side!

736
01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:23,650
What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?

737
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:24:32.250 --> 01:24:34.649
It's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!

738
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:24:34.650 --> 01:24:39.350
- Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
- Leave it to me.

739
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:25:00.850 --> 01:25:02.650
Come on, Hermione!

740
01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:20,550
Lacarnum lnflamarae.

741
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:30,650
Fire! You're on fire!

742
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:50,650
Go, go, go, go!

743
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:45,050
Looks like he's gonna be sick.

744
01:26:45,850 --> 01:26:47,449
He's got the Snitch!

745
01:26:47,450 --> 01:26:51,749
Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!

746
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:53.750
Gryffindor wins!

747
01:27:37,050 --> 01:27:41,449
Nonsense! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

748
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:45.649
Who knows? Why was he trying
to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween?

749
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:27:45.650 --> 01:27:48.249
- Who told you about Fluffy?
- Fluffy?

750
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:27:48.250 --> 01:27:52.149
- That thing has a name?
- Of course he's got a name. He's mine.

751
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:27:52.150 --> 01:27:54.745
I bought him off an lrish feller
I met down at the pub last year.

752
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:27:54.746 --> 01:27:56.601
Then I lent him to
Dumbledore to guard the...

753
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:27:56.602 --> 01:27:57.302
Yes?

754
01:27:57,375 --> 01:27:59,325
Shouldn't have said that.
No more questions!

755
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:27:59.326 --> 01:28:02.575
Don't ask any more questions.
That's top-secret, that is.

756
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:28:02.650 --> 01:28:06.849
But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding,
Snape's trying to steal it.

757
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:28:07.050 --> 01:28:10.750
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts teacher.

758
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:16.249
Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a spell when
I see one. I've read all about them.

759
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:28:16.250 --> 01:28:20.049
You've got to keep eye contact,
and Snape wasn't blinking.

760
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:28:20.050 --> 01:28:22.650
Exactly.

761
01:28:22,950 --> 01:28:25,949
Now, you listen to me,
all three of you.

762
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:28:25.950 --> 01:28:30.849
You're meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in. It's dangerous.

763
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:28:30.850 --> 01:28:36.149
What that dog is guarding is strictly
between Prof. Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

764
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:28:36.150 --> 01:28:37.850
Nicholas Flamel?

765
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:43,449
I shouldn't have said that.
I should not have said that.

766
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:28:43.450 --> 01:28:47.749
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?

767
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:50.050
I don't know.

768
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:11,649
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas.

769
01:29:11,650 --> 01:29:14,649
Ring the Hogwart bell.

770
01:29:14,650 --> 01:29:17,649
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas.

771
01:29:17,650 --> 01:29:20,950
Cast a Christmas spell.

772
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:37,850
Knight to e5.

773
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:47,750
Queen to e5.

774
01:29:53,050 --> 01:29:54,750
That's totally barbaric!

775
01:29:55,050 --> 01:29:58,849
That's wizard's chess.
I see you've packed.

776
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:29:58.850 --> 01:30:00.550
I see you haven't.

777
01:30:00,650 --> 01:30:06,049
Change of plans. My parents decided to go
to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie.

778
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:30:06.050 --> 01:30:10.049
- He's studying dragons there.
- Good. You can help Harry, then.

779
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:30:10.050 --> 01:30:13.649
He's going to go and look in the library
for information on Nicholas Flamel.

780
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:30:13.650 --> 01:30:17.450
We've looked a hundred times!

781
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:23,350
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.

782
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:30:25.250 --> 01:30:28.450
I think we've had
a bad influence on her.

783
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:30:30.650 --> 01:30:35.350
Harry, wake up!
Come on, Harry, wake up!

784
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:30:44.850 --> 01:30:48.449
- Happy Christmas, Harry.
- Happy Christmas, Ron.

785
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:30:48.450 --> 01:30:50.950
What are you wearing?

786
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:55,250
Oh, my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.

787
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:30:56.050 --> 01:30:58.750
- I've got presents?
- Yeah.

788
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:31:05.850 --> 01:31:08.250
There they are.

789
01:31:19,050 --> 01:31:22,749
"Your father left this
in my possession before he died.

790
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:31:22.750 --> 01:31:27.150
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well."

791
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:31:43.650 --> 01:31:47.649
- What is it?
- Some kind of cloak.

792
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:31:47.650 --> 01:31:50.950
Well, let's see, then. Put it on.

793
01:31:56,050 --> 01:31:57,549
My body's gone!

794
01:31:57,550 --> 01:32:01,450
I know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak!

795
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:32:01.650 --> 01:32:03.850
I'm invisible?

796
01:32:04,050 --> 01:32:08,750
They're really rare.
I wonder who gave it to you.

797
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:14.050
There was no name.
It just said, "Use it well."

798
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:47.849
Famous Fire-Eaters.
Fifteenth-Century Fiends.

799
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:32:47.850 --> 01:32:54.050
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?

800
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:14.750
Who's there?

801
01:33:20,550 --> 01:33:26,550
I know you're in there.
You can't hide.

802
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:33:33.550 --> 01:33:37.650
Who is it? Show yourself.

803
01:34:24,550 --> 01:34:26,150
Severus, I...

804
01:34:26,550 --> 01:34:30,649
You don't want me
as your enemy, Quirrell.

805
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:34:30.650 --> 01:34:35.650
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know perfectly well what I mean.

806
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:56.049
We'll have another little chat soon.

807
01:34:56,050 --> 01:35:01,749
When you've had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.

808
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:06.450
Professors. I found this
in the restricted section.

809
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:35:06.650 --> 01:35:12.050
It's still hot. That means
there's a student out of bed.

810
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:36:43.850 --> 01:36:45.950
Mum?

811
01:36:48,850 --> 01:36:51,150
Dad?

812
01:37:25,650 --> 01:37:30,950
Ron, you've really gotta see this!
Ron, you've gotta see this!

813
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:37:32.450 --> 01:37:35.549
Ron, Ron, come on, get out of bed!

814
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:36,330
Why?

815
01:37:36,356 --> 01:37:39,475
There's something you've got to see.
Now, come on!

816
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:37:45.850 --> 01:37:50.450
Come on! Come!
Come look, it's my parents!

817
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:37:51.650 --> 01:37:53.849
I only see us.

818
01:37:53,850 --> 01:37:57,349
Look in properly.
Go on, stand there.

819
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:37:57.350 --> 01:38:03.550
- There. You see them, don't you?
- That's me! Only I'm head boy.

820
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:06.349
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.

821
01:38:06,350 --> 01:38:10,850
And bloody hell!
I'm Quidditch captain too!

822
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:38:11.650 --> 01:38:14.450
I look good.

823
01:38:14,750 --> 01:38:18,749
Harry, do you think this mirror
shows the future?

824
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:38:18.750 --> 01:38:24.050
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.

825
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:39.950
Do you like yours, Ron?

826
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:47,850
- Ron?
- I'll be right back.

827
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:38:57.350 --> 01:39:00.949
- Wanna play chess?
- No.

828
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:05.649
- Wanna go and visit Hagrid?
- No.

829
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:39:05.650 --> 01:39:09.449
Harry, I know what you're thinking,
but don't.

830
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:39:09.450 --> 01:39:13.650
There's something not right
about that mirror.

831
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:39:39.850 --> 01:39:42.350
Back again, Harry?

832
01:39:45,150 --> 01:39:47,849
I see that you,
like so many before you...

833
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:39:47.850 --> 01:39:52.349
...have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.

834
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:39:52.350 --> 01:39:56.850
I trust by now
you realize what it does.

835
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:39:57.850 --> 01:40:00.650
Let me give you a clue.

836
01:40:00,950 --> 01:40:03,249
The happiest man on earth...

837
01:40:03,250 --> 01:40:06,849
...would look into the mirror
and see only himself...

838
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:40:06.850 --> 01:40:09.349
...exactly as he is.

839
01:40:09,350 --> 01:40:14,649
So then, it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.

840
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:40:14.650 --> 01:40:17.750
Yes. And no.

841
01:40:18,450 --> 01:40:21,049
It shows us nothing more or less...

842
01:40:21,050 --> 01:40:27,249
...than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts.

843
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:40:27.250 --> 01:40:32.249
Now you, Harry, who have
never known your family...

844
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:40:32.250 --> 01:40:36.249
...you see them standing beside you.

845
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:38,949
But remember this, Harry.

846
01:40:38,950 --> 01:40:45,049
This mirror gives us
neither knowledge...

847
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:40:45.050 --> 01:40:47.450
...or truth.

848
01:40:48,150 --> 01:40:54,450
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.

849
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:40:55.250 --> 01:40:59.549
That is why tomorrow
it will be moved to a new home.

850
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:40:59.550 --> 01:41:01.750
And I must ask you...

851
01:41:02,450 --> 01:41:06,650
...not to go looking for it again.

852
01:41:07,050 --> 01:41:10,550
It does not do
to dwell on dreams, Harry...

853
01:41:10,750 --> 01:41:13,950
...and forget to live.

854
01:42:09,950 --> 01:42:12,250
Hi, Hedwig.

855
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:17,849
Look at you, playing with your cards.
Pathetic!

856
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:42:17.850 --> 01:42:20.149
We've got final exams coming up soon.

857
01:42:20,150 --> 01:42:22,949
I'm ready. Ask me any question.

858
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:27,449
Alright, what are the 3 most crucial ingredients
in a Forgetfulness Potion?

859
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:42:27.450 --> 01:42:28.949
I forgot.

860
01:42:28,950 --> 01:42:32,149
And what, may I ask, do you plan to do
if this comes up in the final exam?

861
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:42:32.150 --> 01:42:34.449
- Copy off you.
- No, you won't.

862
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:42:34.450 --> 01:42:37.394
Besides, according to Professor
McGonagall, we're to be

863
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:40.549
given special quills bewitched
with an Anti-Cheating Spell.

864
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:47.150
That's insulting! It's as if they
don't trust us! Dumbledore again!

865
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:54.850
- Leg-Locker Curse?
- Malfoy.

866
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:42:59.750 --> 01:43:03.050
You have got to start
standing up to people, Neville.

867
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:43:03.150 --> 01:43:06.749
How? I can barely stand at all!

868
01:43:06,750 --> 01:43:09,050
I'll do the countercurse!

869
01:43:09,150 --> 01:43:13,549
No, that's all I need!
You to set my bloody kneecups on fire!

870
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:17.149
I don't appreciate
the insinuation, Longbottom.

871
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:43:17.150 --> 01:43:20.549
Besides, if anyone cared to notice...

872
01:43:20,550 --> 01:43:25,150
...my eyebrows have
completely grown back!

873
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:43:28.250 --> 01:43:30.549
I found him!

874
01:43:30,550 --> 01:43:35,949
"Dumbledore is particularly famous for his
defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945."

875
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:43:35.950 --> 01:43:36.630
Go on!

876
01:43:36,656 --> 01:43:39,349
"For the discovery of the
twelve uses of dragon blood...

877
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:42.649
...and his work on alchemy with his
partner, Nicholas Flamel"!

878
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:43:42.650 --> 01:43:46.249
I knew the name sound familiar.
I read it on the train that day.

879
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:43:46.250 --> 01:43:48.850
Follow me!

880
01:43:52,350 --> 01:43:56,350
Hey! Wait! Where are you going?

881
01:43:57,850 --> 01:44:01,450
What about the countercurse?

882
01:44:02,650 --> 01:44:08,549
I had you looking in the wrong section.
How could I be so stupid?

883
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:11.849
I checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading.

884
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:44:11.850 --> 01:44:14.150
This is light?

885
01:44:18,450 --> 01:44:21,049
Of course! Here it is!

886
01:44:21,050 --> 01:44:25,349
Nicholas Flamel is the only known
maker of the Philosopher's Stone.

887
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:44:25.350 --> 01:44:26.750
The what?

888
01:44:27,150 --> 01:44:30,349
Honestly, don't you two read?

889
01:44:30,350 --> 01:44:35,049
"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers.

890
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:44:35.050 --> 01:44:37.849
It'll transform any metal
into pure gold...

891
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:44:37.850 --> 01:44:42.149
...and produces the Elixir of Life
which will make the drinker immortal."

892
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:44:42.150 --> 01:44:44.449
- lmmortal?
- It means you'll never die.

893
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:44:44.450 --> 01:44:46.850
I know what it means!

894
01:44:47,450 --> 01:44:52,349
"The only Stone currently in existence
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

895
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:44:52.350 --> 01:44:57.850
...the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday."

896
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:44:59.250 --> 01:45:01.649
That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor.

897
01:45:01,650 --> 01:45:06,650
That's what's under the trap door.
The Philosopher's Stone.

898
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:45:22.826 --> 01:45:23.526
Hagrid.

899
01:45:23,550 --> 01:45:27,149
Oh, hello, sorry, don't wish to be rude,
but I'm in no fit state to entertain today.

900
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:45:27.150 --> 01:45:30.150
We know about the Philosopher's Stone.

901
01:45:34,550 --> 01:45:36,592
We think Snape's
trying to steal it.

902
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:45:36.618 --> 01:45:39.849
Snape? Blimey, you're not
still on about him, are you?

903
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:45:39.850 --> 01:45:42.950
Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone.
We just don't know why.

904
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:45:43.050 --> 01:45:47.449
Snape is one of the teachers
protecting the Stone. He's not about to steal it.

905
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:45:47.450 --> 01:45:48.749
What?

906
01:45:48,750 --> 01:45:52,349
You heard. Right. Come on, now,
I'm a bit preoccupied today.

907
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:45:52.350 --> 01:45:55.249
Wait a minute.
"One of the teachers"?

908
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:45:55.250 --> 01:45:59.349
Of course! There are other things
defending the Stone, aren't there?

909
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:45:59.350 --> 01:46:02.249
- Spells, enchantments.
- That's right.

910
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:46:02.250 --> 01:46:05.449
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

911
01:46:05,450 --> 01:46:07,749
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

912
01:46:07,750 --> 01:46:11,649
Ain't a soul knows how,
except for me and Dumbledore.

913
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:46:11.650 --> 01:46:15.550
I shouldn't have told you that.
I should not have told you that.

914
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:46:29.050 --> 01:46:34.449
- Hagrid, what exactly is that?
- That? It's...

915
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:46:34.450 --> 01:46:36.649
I know what that is!

916
01:46:36,650 --> 01:46:39,550
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?

917
01:46:39,650 --> 01:46:43,149
I won it. Off a stranger
I met down at the pub.

918
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:46:43.150 --> 01:46:47.550
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it,
as a matter of fact.

919
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:47:09.450 --> 01:47:11.950
Is that...

920
01:47:12,450 --> 01:47:13,849
...a dragon?

921
01:47:13,850 --> 01:47:18,449
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.

922
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:47:18.450 --> 01:47:21.549
My brother Charlie works
with these in Romania.

923
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:47:21.550 --> 01:47:26.750
Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.

924
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:47:27.050 --> 01:47:29.149
Hello, Norbert.

925
01:47:29,150 --> 01:47:33,750
- Norbert?
- Yeah, well, he's gotta have a name, don't he?

926
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:47:34.250 --> 01:47:36.950
Don't you, Norbert?

927
01:47:43,650 --> 01:47:47,050
He'll have to be trained up a bit,
of course.

928
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:47:50.650 --> 01:47:53.050
Who's that?

929
01:47:54,450 --> 01:47:56,850
Malfoy.

930
01:47:57,250 --> 01:47:58,950
Oh, dear.

931
01:48:00,450 --> 01:48:05,449
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
He told me so the first time I met him.

932
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:48:05.450 --> 01:48:09.649
It's crazy.
And worse, Malfoy knows.

933
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:48:09.650 --> 01:48:14.049
- I don't understand. ls that bad?
- It's bad.

934
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:48:14.050 --> 01:48:16.550
Good evening.

935
01:48:19,850 --> 01:48:23,049
Nothing, I repeat, nothing...

936
01:48:23,050 --> 01:48:26,749
...gives a student the right
to walk about the school at night.

937
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:31.849
Therefore, as punishment for your actions,

938
01:48:31,850 --> 01:48:34,450
- 50?!
- Each.

939
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:48:35.150 --> 01:48:37.749
And to ensure it doesn't happen again...

940
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:41,350
...all four of you
will receive detention.

941
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:48:42.050 --> 01:48:45.249
Excuse me, professor,
perhaps I heard you wrong.

942
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:48:45.250 --> 01:48:47.749
I thought you said the four of us.

943
01:48:47,750 --> 01:48:50,449
No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy.

944
01:48:50,450 --> 01:48:55,750
You see, honorable as your intentions were,
you too were out of bed after hours.

945
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:48:55.950 --> 01:48:59.150
You will join your classmates
in detention.

946
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:49:10.050 --> 01:49:14.249
A pity they let
the old punishments die.

947
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:49:14.250 --> 01:49:19.249
There was a time detention would find you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.

948
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:49:19.250 --> 01:49:22.350
God, I miss the screaming.

949
01:49:24,650 --> 01:49:28,149
You'll be serving detention
with Hagrid tonight.

950
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:49:28.150 --> 01:49:33.750
He's got a little job to do
inside the Dark Forest.

951
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:49:35.550 --> 01:49:38.750
A sorry lot, this, Hagrid.

952
01:49:39,950 --> 01:49:45,250
Oh, good God, man, you're not still on
about that bloody dragon, are you?

953
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:49:47.250 --> 01:49:49.550
Norbert's gone.

954
01:49:49,850 --> 01:49:53,649
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania
to live in a colony.

955
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:49:53.650 --> 01:49:57.049
Well, that's good, isn't it?
He'll be with his own kind.

956
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:49:57.050 --> 01:49:59.649
Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania?

957
01:49:59,650 --> 01:50:04,150
What if the other dragons are mean
to him? He's only a baby, after all.

958
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:10.049
Oh, for God's sake, pull yourself together, man.
You're going into the Forest, after all.

959
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:50:10.050 --> 01:50:12.549
Got to have your wits about you.

960
01:50:12,550 --> 01:50:18,550
The Forest? I thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.

961
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:50:18.650 --> 01:50:22.850
Students aren't allowed.
And there are...

962
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:50:24.050 --> 01:50:25.650
...werewolves.

963
01:50:25,750 --> 01:50:29,249
There's more than werewolves
in those trees, lad.

964
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:50:29.250 --> 01:50:32.250
You can be sure of that.

965
01:50:33,850 --> 01:50:35,550
Nighty-night.

966
01:50:37,850 --> 01:50:41,050
Right. Let's go.

967
01:51:18,950 --> 01:51:21,549
Hagrid, what is that?

968
01:51:21,550 --> 01:51:25,250
What we're here for.
See that?

969
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:51:25.450 --> 01:51:31.150
That's unicorn blood, that is.
I found one dead a few weeks ago.

970
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:36.250
Now, this one's been hurt bad
by something.

971
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:51:43.450 --> 01:51:49.449
So, it's our job to go
and find the poor beast.

972
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:51:49.450 --> 01:51:52.850
Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.

973
01:51:53,050 --> 01:51:56,550
And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.

974
01:51:57,550 --> 01:52:00,049
Okay. Then I get Fang.

975
01:52:00,050 --> 01:52:06,050
Fine. Just so you know,
he's a bloody coward.

976
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:52:09.450 --> 01:52:14.649
You wait till my father hears about this.
This is servant's stuff.

977
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:52:14.650 --> 01:52:18.749
If I didn't know better, Draco,
I'd say you were scared.

978
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:52:18.750 --> 01:52:21.650
I'm not scared, Potter.

979
01:52:22,450 --> 01:52:24,750
Did you hear that?

980
01:52:27,050 --> 01:52:28,649
Come on, Fang.

981
01:52:28,650 --> 01:52:30,450
Scared!

982
01:52:55,150 --> 01:52:57,550
What is it, Fang?

983
01:54:07,650 --> 01:54:13,349
Harry Potter, you must leave.
You are known to many creatures here.

984
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:17.549
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.

985
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:54:17.550 --> 01:54:20.549
What was that thing you saved me from?

986
01:54:20,550 --> 01:54:26,049
A monstrous creature.
It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.

987
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:54:26.050 --> 01:54:31.849
Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep
you alive even if you are an inch from death.

988
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:54:31.850 --> 01:54:37.149
But at a terrible price. You
have slain something so pure...

989
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:54:37.150 --> 01:54:42.149
...that from the moment the blood touches
your lips, you will have a half-life.

990
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:54:42.150 --> 01:54:44.149
A cursed life.

991
01:54:44,150 --> 01:54:48,349
- But who would choose such a life?
- Can you think of no one?

992
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:53.649
Do you mean to say that
thing that killed the unicorn...

993
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:54:53.650 --> 01:54:57.749
...that was drinking its blood,
that was Voldemort?

994
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:54:57.750 --> 01:55:03.250
Do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment, Mr. Potter?

995
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:55:03.750 --> 01:55:05.650
The Philosopher's Stone.

996
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:08,950
Harry!

997
01:55:09,250 --> 01:55:13,949
Hello there, Firenze.
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.

998
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:55:13.950 --> 01:55:16.450
You all right there, Harry?

999
01:55:17,250 --> 01:55:21,850
Harry Potter,
this is where I leave you.

1000
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:55:22.450 --> 01:55:26.550
You're safe now. Good luck.

1001
01:55:33,850 --> 01:55:38,249
You mean, You-Know-Who is out there
right now in the Forest?

1002
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:55:38.250 --> 01:55:41.249
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.

1003
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:55:41.250 --> 01:55:44.349
Don't you see? 
We had it wrong.

1004
01:55:44,350 --> 01:55:48,949
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.
He wants the stone for Voldemort.

1005
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:55:48.950 --> 01:55:53.649
With the Elixir of Life,
Voldemort will be strong again.

1006
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:55:53.650 --> 01:55:55.449
He'll come back.

1007
01:55:55,450 --> 01:55:57,449
But if he comes back...

1008
01:55:57,450 --> 01:56:01,750
...you don't think he'll try
to kill you, do you?

1009
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:56:02.450 --> 01:56:06.249
I think if he'd had the chance,
he might have tried to kill me tonight.

1010
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:56:06.250 --> 01:56:10.049
And to think, I've been worrying
about my Potions final.

1011
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:56:10.050 --> 01:56:13.949
Hang on a minute.
We're forgetting one thing.

1012
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:56:13.950 --> 01:56:19.150
Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?

1013
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:56:19.650 --> 01:56:24.949
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore
is around, Harry, you're safe.

1014
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:29.350
As long as Dumbledore is around,
you can't be touched.

1015
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:56:34.750 --> 01:56:40.349
I'd always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams
were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.

1016
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:56:40.350 --> 01:56:44.249
Speak for yourself.
All right there, Harry?

1017
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:56:44.250 --> 01:56:49.649
- My scar. It keeps burning.
- It's happened before.

1018
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:56:49.650 --> 01:56:52.549
- Not like this.
- Perhaps you should see the nurse.

1019
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:56.350
I think it's a warning.
It means danger's coming.

1020
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:57:03.650 --> 01:57:06.349
- Of course!
- What is it?

1021
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:57:06.350 --> 01:57:10.249
Don't you think it's a bit odd that what
Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon...

1022
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:57:10.250 --> 01:57:13.549
...and a stranger turns up who
just happens to have one?

1023
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:57:13.550 --> 01:57:16.449
I mean, how many people wander around
with dragon eggs in their pockets?

1024
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:57:16.450 --> 01:57:19.050
Why didn't I see it before?

1025
01:57:24,250 --> 01:57:28,049
Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg?
What did he look like?

1026
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:57:28.050 --> 01:57:30.949
I don't know, I never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.

1027
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:33.850
The stranger, though, You and he
must have talked.

1028
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:57:34.150 --> 01:57:37.849
Well, he wanted to know what sort
of creatures I looked after.

1029
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:57:37.850 --> 01:57:42.049
I told him. I said, "After Fluffy,
a dragon's gonna be no problem."

1030
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:57:42.050 --> 01:57:46.850
- And did he seem interested in Fluffy?
- Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy.

1031
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:51.349
How often do you come across a
three-headed dog, even if you're in the trade?

1032
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:57.249
But I told him. I said, "The trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him."

1033
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:57:57.250 --> 01:58:02.950
Take Fluffy, for example. Just play him a bit of
music and he falls straight to sleep.

1034
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:58:04.250 --> 01:58:07.249
I shouldn't have told you that.

1035
01:58:07,250 --> 01:58:09,750
Where are you going? Wait!

1036
01:58:16,450 --> 01:58:19,550
We have to see Professor Dumbledore.
Immediately!

1037
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:58:19.650 --> 01:58:22.549
I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here.

1038
01:58:22,550 --> 01:58:27,249
He received an urgent owl from the
Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.

1039
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:58:27.250 --> 01:58:30.049
He's gone? Now?
But this is important!

1040
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:58:30.050 --> 01:58:32.550
This is about the Philosopher's Stone!

1041
01:58:34,150 --> 01:58:38,150
- How do you know...?
- Someone's going to try and steal it.

1042
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:58:38.450 --> 01:58:41.333
I don't know how you three
found out about the stone,

1043
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:58:41.359 --> 01:58:43.949
but I assure you it is
perfectly well protected.

1044
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:58:43.950 --> 01:58:48.550
Now would you go back
to your dormitories? Quietly.

1045
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:58:56.550 --> 01:58:59.549
That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village.
It was Snape.

1046
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:58:59.550 --> 01:59:02.449
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

1047
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:59:02.450 --> 01:59:06.550
- And with Dumbledore gone...
- Good afternoon.

1048
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:59:08.350 --> 01:59:11.649
Now, what would three young
Gryffindors such as yourselves...

1049
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:59:11.650 --> 01:59:16.250
...be doing inside on a day like this?

1050
01:59:20,650 --> 01:59:24,550
- We were just...
- You ought to be careful.

1051
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
01:59:24.850 --> 01:59:27.050
People will think you're...

1052
01:59:31,050 --> 01:59:34,050
...up to something.

1053
01:59:44,050 --> 01:59:46,249
Now what do we do?

1054
01:59:46,250 --> 01:59:50,350
We go down the trap door. Tonight.

1055
02:00:03,850 --> 02:00:05,549
Trevor.

1056
02:00:05,550 --> 02:00:09,249
Trevor, shh! go! 
You shouldn't be here!

1057
02:00:09,250 --> 02:00:14,849
Neither should you.
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?

1058
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:00:14.850 --> 02:00:19.049
- Now, Neville, listen. We were...
- No, I won't let you!

1059
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:00:19.050 --> 02:00:23.849
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.
I'll fight you.

1060
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:00:23.850 --> 02:00:28.550
Neville, I'm really really sorry about this.
Petrificus Totalus.

1061
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:00:36.150 --> 02:00:40.249
You're a little scary sometimes,
you know that?

1062
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:00:40.250 --> 02:00:44.150
Brilliant, but scary.

1063
02:00:44,450 --> 02:00:46,749
Let's go.

1064
02:00:46,750 --> 02:00:51,350
- Sorry.
- It's for your own good, you know.

1065
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:00:56.450 --> 02:01:00.750
- Ow! You stood on my foot!
- Sorry.

1066
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:01:04.250 --> 02:01:06.650
Alohomora.

1067
02:01:18,350 --> 02:01:21,150
Wait a minute. He's...

1068
02:01:22,150 --> 02:01:24,550
...snoring.

1069
02:01:26,850 --> 02:01:32,650
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.

1070
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:01:33.950 --> 02:01:37.250
It's got horrible breath.

1071
02:01:39,550 --> 02:01:41,849
- We have to move its paw.
- What?

1072
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:01:41.850 --> 02:01:43.550
Come on!

1073
02:01:47,250 --> 02:01:49,650
Okay. Push.

1074
02:02:12,450 --> 02:02:16,349
I'll go first. Don't follow
until I give you a sign.

1075
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:02:16.350 --> 02:02:21.650
If something bad happens,
get yourselves out.

1076
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:02:22.150 --> 02:02:25.950
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

1077
02:02:26,250 --> 02:02:28,450
The harp.

1078
02:02:28,850 --> 02:02:31,850
It's stopped playing.

1079
02:02:41,550 --> 02:02:42,950
Jump!

1080
02:02:56,850 --> 02:03:00,750
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.

1081
02:03:14,950 --> 02:03:18,249
Stop moving, both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.

1082
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:03:18.250 --> 02:03:22.149
You have to relax. If you don't,
it will only kill you faster.

1083
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:03:22.150 --> 02:03:27.450
Kill us faster?
Oh, now I can relax!

1084
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:03:29.450 --> 02:03:31.050
Hermione!

1085
02:03:31,350 --> 02:03:35,349
- Now what are we gonna do?
- Just relax!

1086
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:03:35.350 --> 02:03:40.150
- Hermione, where are you?
- Do what I say! Trust me.

1087
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:03:46.950 --> 02:03:50.449
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1088
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:03:50.450 --> 02:03:53.749
- He's not relaxing, is he?
- Apparently not.

1089
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:56.449
- We've gotta do something.
- What?

1090
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:03:56.450 --> 02:03:59.750
I remember reading something
in Herbology.

1091
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:04:00.250 --> 02:04:04.349
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare.
It's deadly fun...

1092
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:04:04.350 --> 02:04:08.949
...but will sulk in the sun!
That's it! Devil Snare hates sunlight.

1093
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:04:08.950 --> 02:04:11.350
Lumus Solem.

1094
02:04:19,050 --> 02:04:21,950
- Ron, you okay?
- Yeah.

1095
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:04:24.350 --> 02:04:27.150
Lucky we didn't panic.

1096
02:04:27,650 --> 02:04:31,350
Lucky Hermione pays attention
in Herbology.

1097
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:04:32.750 --> 02:04:34.449
What is that?

1098
02:04:34,450 --> 02:04:38,450
I don't know. Sounds like wings.

1099
02:04:51,250 --> 02:04:54,949
Curious. I've never seen
birds like these.

1100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:04:54.950 --> 02:04:58.849
They're not birds.
They're keys.

1101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:04:58.850 --> 02:05:02.550
And I'll bet one of them
fits that door.

1102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:05:05.750 --> 02:05:10.650
- What's this all about?
- I don't know.

1103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:05:16.250 --> 02:05:18.550
Strange.

1104
02:05:18,650 --> 02:05:21,250
Alohomora!

1105
02:05:23,950 --> 02:05:26,449
Well, it was worth a try.

1106
02:05:26,450 --> 02:05:29,849
What're we going to do?
There must be a thousand keys up there.

1107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:05:29.850 --> 02:05:34.049
We're looking for a big old fashioned one.
Probably rusty like the handle.

1108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:05:34.050 --> 02:05:37.750
There! I see it!
The one with the broken wing.

1109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:05:41.050 --> 02:05:43.650
What's wrong, Harry?

1110
02:05:44,250 --> 02:05:45,949
It's too simple.

1111
02:05:45,950 --> 02:05:50,849
Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape could catch it
on that old broomstick, you can.

1112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:05:50.850 --> 02:05:54.750
You're the youngest Seeker
in a century.

1113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:06:11.250 --> 02:06:14.550
This complicates things a bit.

1114
02:06:35,550 --> 02:06:37,750
Catch the key!

1115
02:06:41,850 --> 02:06:44,150
Hurry up!

1116
02:07:16,250 --> 02:07:21,149
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

1117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:07:21.150 --> 02:07:24.650
Where are we? A graveyard.

1118
02:07:24,750 --> 02:07:27,650
This is no graveyard.

1119
02:07:34,850 --> 02:07:38,050
It's a chessboard.

1120
02:07:49,750 --> 02:07:51,950
There's the door.

1121
02:08:03,750 --> 02:08:05,550
Now what do we do?

1122
02:08:05,650 --> 02:08:10,050
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got
to play our way across the room.

1123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:08:10.350 --> 02:08:14.350
Alright. Harry, you take
the empty bishop's square.

1124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:08:14.450 --> 02:08:18.849
Hermione, you'll be
the queen-side castle.

1125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:08:18.850 --> 02:08:23.250
As for me, I'll be a knight.

1126
02:08:30,050 --> 02:08:32,150
What happens now?

1127
02:08:32,650 --> 02:08:35,849
Well, white moves first.

1128
02:08:35,850 --> 02:08:37,950
And then...

1129
02:08:39,450 --> 02:08:40,950
...we play.

1130
02:08:51,250 --> 02:08:56,549
Ron, you don't suppose
this is going to be like...

1131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:08:56.550 --> 02:09:00.449
...real wizard's chess, do you?

1132
02:09:00,450 --> 02:09:03,750
You there, d5.

1133
02:09:18,050 --> 02:09:19,849
Yes, Hermione.

1134
02:09:19,850 --> 02:09:25,250
I think this is gonna be
exactly like wizard's chess.

1135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:09:30.850 --> 02:09:33.650
Castle to e4!

1136
02:09:36,950 --> 02:09:39,550
Pawn to c3!

1137
02:10:23,950 --> 02:10:28,149
- Wait a minute.
- You understand right, Harry.

1138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:10:28.150 --> 02:10:33.150
Once I make my move,
the queen will take me.

1139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:10:33.450 --> 02:10:36.049
Then you're free to check the king.

1140
02:10:36,050 --> 02:10:39,050
- No. Ron, no!
- What is it?

1141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:10:39.350 --> 02:10:44.249
- He's going to sacrifice himself.
- No, you can't! there must be another way!

1142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:10:44.250 --> 02:10:48.249
Do you wanna stop Snape
from getting that Stone or not?

1143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:10:48.250 --> 02:10:52.150
Harry, it's you that has to go on.
I know it.

1144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:10:52.350 --> 02:10:55.350
Not me. Not Hermione. You.

1145
02:11:05,350 --> 02:11:08,550
Knight to h3.

1146
02:11:29,150 --> 02:11:31,450
Check.

1147
02:12:00,350 --> 02:12:02,349
Ron!

1148
02:12:02,350 --> 02:12:08,450
No, don't move!
Don't forget, we're still playing.

1149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:12:23.250 --> 02:12:24.750
Checkmate.

1150
02:12:44,450 --> 02:12:47,149
Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery.

1151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:12:47.150 --> 02:12:51.249
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.

1152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:12:51.250 --> 02:12:53.350
I have to go on.

1153
02:12:53,650 --> 02:12:59,749
You'll be okay, Harry.
You're a great wizard. You really are.

1154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:12:59.750 --> 02:13:02.550
Not as good as you.

1155
02:13:03,050 --> 02:13:08,150
Me? Books and cleverness.
There are more important things.

1156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:13:09.150 --> 02:13:15.050
Friendship and bravery.
And, Harry, just be careful.

1157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:13:52.850 --> 02:13:54.750
You?

1158
02:13:55,250 --> 02:13:59,349
No, it can't be.
Snape, he was the...

1159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:13:59.350 --> 02:14:02.549
Yes, he does seem the type,
doesn't he?

1160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:14:02.550 --> 02:14:05.949
Next to him, who would suspect...

1161
02:14:05,950 --> 02:14:10,049
...poor, stuttering
Professor Quirrell?

1162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:14:10.050 --> 02:14:15.649
But that day, during the Quidditch match,
Snape tried to kill me.

1163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:14:15.650 --> 02:14:18.750
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!

1164
02:14:18,950 --> 02:14:23,349
And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught
fire and broken my eye contact...

1165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:14:23.350 --> 02:14:25.749
...l would have succeeded.

1166
02:14:25,750 --> 02:14:28,949
Even with Snape muttering
his little countercurse.

1167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:14:28.950 --> 02:14:31.349
Snape was trying to save me?

1168
02:14:31,350 --> 02:14:36,949
I knew you were a danger to me right from the off.
Especially after Halloween.

1169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:14:36.950 --> 02:14:41.349
- Then you let the troll in!
- Very good, Potter, yes.

1170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:14:41.350 --> 02:14:44.650
Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.

1171
02:14:44,950 --> 02:14:50,250
While everyone else was running about dungeon,
he went to the third floor to head me off.

1172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:14:50.850 --> 02:14:54.650
He, of course, never trusted me again.

1173
02:14:55,350 --> 02:15:00,849
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.

1174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:15:00.850 --> 02:15:05.049
I'm never alone. Never.

1175
02:15:05,050 --> 02:15:09,450
Now, what does this mirror do?

1176
02:15:10,750 --> 02:15:13,150
I see what I desire.

1177
02:15:13,450 --> 02:15:18,049
I see myself holding the Stone.
But how do I get it?

1178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:15:18.050 --> 02:15:20.550
Use the boy.

1179
02:15:21,050 --> 02:15:25,250
Come here, Potter! Now!

1180
02:15:37,050 --> 02:15:41,350
Tell me, what do you see?

1181
02:16:06,150 --> 02:16:08,849
What is it? What do you see?

1182
02:16:08,850 --> 02:16:14,149
I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the house cup.

1183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:16:14.150 --> 02:16:16.050
He lies.

1184
02:16:16,250 --> 02:16:20,149
Tell the truth! 
What do you see?

1185
02:16:20,150 --> 02:16:24,749
- Let me speak to him.
- Master, you are not strong enough.

1186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:16:24.750 --> 02:16:29.050
I have strength enough for this.

1187
02:16:46,950 --> 02:16:50,049
Harry Potter...

1188
02:16:50,050 --> 02:16:52,649
...we meet again.

1189
02:16:52,650 --> 02:16:54,249
Voldemort.

1190
02:16:54,250 --> 02:16:58,449
Yes. You see what I've become?

1191
02:16:58,450 --> 02:17:02,249
See what I must do to survive?

1192
02:17:02,250 --> 02:17:06,650
Live off another. 
A mere parasite.

1193
02:17:07,050 --> 02:17:10,549
Unicorn blood can sustain me...

1194
02:17:10,550 --> 02:17:14,449
...but it cannot give me
a body of my own.

1195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:17:14.450 --> 02:17:18.249
But there is something that can.

1196
02:17:18,250 --> 02:17:24,150
Something that, conveniently enough,
lies in your pocket.

1197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:17:24.250 --> 02:17:26.150
Stop him!

1198
02:17:30,850 --> 02:17:33,950
Don't be a fool.

1199
02:17:34,050 --> 02:17:37,449
Why suffer an horrific death...

1200
02:17:37,450 --> 02:17:41,249
...when you can join me and live?

1201
02:17:41,250 --> 02:17:42,650
Never!

1202
02:17:44,350 --> 02:17:49,450
Bravery. Your parents had it too.

1203
02:17:49,850 --> 02:17:53,449
Tell me, Harry...

1204
02:17:53,450 --> 02:17:57,549
...would you like to see
your mother and father again?

1205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:17:57.550 --> 02:17:59.849
Together...

1206
02:17:59,850 --> 02:18:02,750
...we can bring them back.

1207
02:18:02,850 --> 02:18:07,850
All I ask is for something in return.

1208
02:18:14,250 --> 02:18:17,650
That's it, Harry.

1209
02:18:18,250 --> 02:18:22,349
There is no good and evil.

1210
02:18:22,350 --> 02:18:25,549
There is only power...

1211
02:18:25,550 --> 02:18:29,950
...and those too weak to seek it.

1212
02:18:30,350 --> 02:18:35,750
Together, we'll do
extraordinary things.

1213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:18:35.850 --> 02:18:38.350
Just give me the Stone!

1214
02:18:40,650 --> 02:18:42,049
You liar!

1215
02:18:42,050 --> 02:18:44,550
Kill him!

1216
02:19:07,750 --> 02:19:13,350
- What is this magic?
- Fool, get the Stone!

1217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:20:58.350 --> 02:21:01.150
Good afternoon, Harry.

1218
02:21:02,950 --> 02:21:07,649
- Tokens from your admirers?
- Admirers?

1219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:21:07.650 --> 02:21:13.849
What happened down in the dungeons between
you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret.

1220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:21:13.850 --> 02:21:18.950
So, naturally, the whole school knows.

1221
02:21:21,050 --> 02:21:24,849
I see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the trouble...

1222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:21:24.850 --> 02:21:27.849
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

1223
02:21:27,850 --> 02:21:31,149
Ron was here? ls he all right?
What about Hermione?

1224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:21:31.150 --> 02:21:36.350
Fine. They're both just fine.

1225
02:21:36,550 --> 02:21:39,650
- What happened to the Stone?
- Relax, dear boy.

1226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:21:39.750 --> 02:21:42.849
The Stone has been destroyed.

1227
02:21:42,850 --> 02:21:46,849
My friend Nicholas and I
have had a little chat...

1228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:21:46.850 --> 02:21:51.449
...and agreed it was best all around.

1229
02:21:51,450 --> 02:21:55,550
But then, Flamel,
he'll die, won't he?

1230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:21:57.250 --> 02:22:02.949
He has enough Elixir
to set his affairs in order.

1231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:22:02.950 --> 02:22:06.449
But yes, he will die.

1232
02:22:06,450 --> 02:22:09,049
How is it I got the Stone, sir?

1233
02:22:09,050 --> 02:22:11,849
One minute I was staring
in the mirror and the next...

1234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:22:11.850 --> 02:22:16.249
You see, only a person...

1235
02:22:16,250 --> 02:22:20,349
...who wanted to find the Stone,
find it...

1236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:22:20.350 --> 02:22:25.250
...but not use it,
would be able to get it.

1237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:22:25.850 --> 02:22:29.649
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

1238
02:22:29,650 --> 02:22:34,950
And between you and me,
that is saying something.

1239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:22:36.050 --> 02:22:41.549
Does that mean, with the Stone gone that is,
that Voldemort can never come back?

1240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:22:41.550 --> 02:22:44.150
I'm afraid...

1241
02:22:45,250 --> 02:22:49,650
...there are ways
in which he can return.

1242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:22:50.050 --> 02:22:52.849
Harry, do you know why...

1243
02:22:52,850 --> 02:22:57,049
...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear
to have you touch him?

1244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:22:57.050 --> 02:23:01.950
It was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.

1245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:23:02.250 --> 02:23:05.649
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

1246
02:23:05,650 --> 02:23:09,649
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.

1247
02:23:09,650 --> 02:23:14,850
- It lives in your very skin.
- What is it?

1248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:23:15.450 --> 02:23:19.450
Love, Harry. Love.

1249
02:23:27,250 --> 02:23:31,549
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

1250
02:23:31,550 --> 02:23:36,449
I was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit-flavored one.

1251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:23:36.450 --> 02:23:39.949
And since then, I'm afraid,
I've lost my liking for them.

1252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:23:39.950 --> 02:23:43.549
But I think I could be safe...

1253
02:23:43,550 --> 02:23:46,250
...with a nice toffee.

1254
02:23:50,050 --> 02:23:51,850
Alas!

1255
02:23:52,250 --> 02:23:54,650
Earwax.

1256
02:24:09,650 --> 02:24:13,050
- All right there, Ron?
- All right. You?

1257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:24:13.850 --> 02:24:16.950
All right. Hermione?

1258
02:24:17,250 --> 02:24:19,450
Never better.

1259
02:24:34,950 --> 02:24:37,650
Another year gone.

1260
02:24:38,150 --> 02:24:42,849
And now, as I understand it,
the house cup needs awarding.

1261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:24:42.850 --> 02:24:45.749
And the points stand thus:

1262
02:24:45,750 --> 02:24:51,850
ln fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.

1263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:24:53.450 --> 02:24:59.450
Third place,
Hufflepuff with 352 points.

1264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:25:04.450 --> 02:25:06.449
In second place...

1265
02:25:06,450 --> 02:25:11,550
...Ravenclaw with 426 points.

1266
02:25:16,950 --> 02:25:18,949
And in first place...

1267
02:25:18,950 --> 02:25:24,750
...with 472 points, 
Slytherin house.

1268
02:25:29,950 --> 02:25:32,550
Nice one, mate.

1269
02:25:36,050 --> 02:25:40,149
Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin.
Well done, Slytherin.

1270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:25:40.150 --> 02:25:44.849
However, recent events must
be taken into account.

1271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:25:44.850 --> 02:25:50.150
And I have a few last-minute points
to award.

1272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:25:50.450 --> 02:25:56.149
To Miss Hermione Granger,
for the cool use of intellect...

1273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:25:56.150 --> 02:25:59.250
...while others were in grave peril...

1274
02:25:59,650 --> 02:26:02,250
...50 points.

1275
02:26:02,850 --> 02:26:04,450
Good job.

1276
02:26:11,850 --> 02:26:18,150
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley,
for the best-played game of chess...

1277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:26:18.450 --> 02:26:23.950
...that Hogwarts has seen
these many years, 50 points.

1278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:26:28.250 --> 02:26:30.650
And third...

1279
02:26:30,850 --> 02:26:33,949
...to Mr. Harry Potter...

1280
02:26:33,950 --> 02:26:38,550
...for pure nerve
and outstanding courage...

1281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:26:38.850 --> 02:26:44.050
...l award Gryffindor house 60 points.

1282
02:26:52,050 --> 02:26:54,149
We're tied with Slytherin!

1283
02:26:54,150 --> 02:27:00,349
Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies...

1284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:27:00.350 --> 02:27:04.449
...but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends.

1285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:27:04.450 --> 02:27:07.649
I award 10 points...

1286
02:27:07,650 --> 02:27:11,150
...to Neville Longbottom.

1287
02:27:24,150 --> 02:27:27,849
Assuming that my calculations
are correct I believe...

1288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:27:27.850 --> 02:27:32.650
...that a change
of decoration is in order.

1289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:27:37.450 --> 02:27:41.050
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

1290
02:28:18,850 --> 02:28:22,349
Come on, now.
Hurry up, you'll be late.

1291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:28:22.350 --> 02:28:26.950
Train's leaving. Go on.
Come on, hurry up.

1292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:28:32.050 --> 02:28:35.650
- Come on, Harry.
- One minute.

1293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:28:41.650 --> 02:28:45.650
Thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye, did you?

1294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:28:48.650 --> 02:28:50.750
This is for you.

1295
02:29:07,250 --> 02:29:09,650
Thanks, Hagrid.

1296
02:29:15,150 --> 02:29:19,850
Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh, listen, Harry.

1297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:29:20.050 --> 02:29:24.749
If that dolt of a cousin of yours,
Dudley, gives you any grief...

1298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
02:29:24.750 --> 02:29:27.649
...you could always threaten him...

1299
02:29:27,650 --> 02:29:30,649
