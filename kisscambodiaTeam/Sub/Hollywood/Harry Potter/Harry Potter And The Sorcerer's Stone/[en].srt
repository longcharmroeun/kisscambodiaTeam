00:29:27,383 --> 00:29:29,218
<font color="#787878">No, I can't spell it.</font>

250
00:29:29,469 --> 00:29:33,723
<font color="#787878">~ All right, Voldemort.
~ Voldemort?</font>

251
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:36,350
<font color="#787878">Shh.</font>

252
00:29:37,685 --> 00:29:39,896
<font color="#787878">It was dark times, Harry.</font>

253
00:29:42,231 --> 00:29:45,359
<font color="#787878">Voldemort started
to gather some followers.</font>

254
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:48,905
<font color="#787878">Brought them over to the Dark Side.</font>

255
00:29:50,323 --> 00:29:53,409
<font color="#787878">Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead.</font>

256
00:29:54,577 --> 00:29:57,622
<font color="#787878">Your parents fought against him.</font>

257
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:01,626
<font color="#787878">But nobody lived once
he decided to kill them.</font>

258
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:08,591
<font color="#787878">Nobody, not one.</font>

259
00:30:08,758 --> 00:30:11,177
<font color="#787878">Except you.</font>

260
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:17,266
<font color="#787878">Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?</font>

261
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:21,938
<font color="#787878">Yes. That ain't no ordinary out on your forehead, Harry.</font>

262
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:27,944
<font color="#787878">A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse, 
an evil curse.</font>

263
00:30:28,194 --> 00:30:31,781
<font color="#787878">What happened to V--?
To You-Know-Who?</font>

264
00:30:32,949 --> 00:30:36,285
<font color="#787878">Well, some say he died.</font>

265
00:30:36,536 --> 00:30:38,955
<font color="#787878">Codswallop, in my opinion.</font>

266
00:30:39,163 --> 00:30:42,416
<font color="#787878">Nope, I reckon he's out there still....</font>

267
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:45,586
<font color="#787878">....too tired to carry on.</font>

268
00:30:45,795 --> 00:30:51,217
<font color="#787878">But one thing's certain. Something about you stumped him that night.</font>

269
00:30:51,467 --> 00:30:55,721
<font color="#787878">That's why you're famous. That's why everybody knows your name.</font>

270
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:59,809
<font color="#787878">You're the boy who lived.</font>

271
00:31:09,193 --> 00:31:11,904
<font color="#787878">What are you looking at?</font>

272
00:31:13,656 --> 00:31:15,658
<font color="#787878">Blimey, is that the time?</font>

273
00:31:15,825 --> 00:31:19,829
<font color="#787878">I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore will be wanting his--</font>

274
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:24,959
<font color="#787878">Well, he'll be wanting to see me. Your train leaves in 10 minutes.</font>

275
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:30,506
<font color="#787878">Here's your ticket. Stick to your ticket, that's very important.</font>

276
00:31:33,342 --> 00:31:35,636
<font color="#787878">"Platform 9 3/4"?</font>

277
00:31:35,845 --> 00:31:40,641
<font color="#787878">But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says platform 9 3/4.</font>

278
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:44,186
<font color="#787878">There's no such thing, is there?</font>

279
00:32:02,705 --> 00:32:04,290
<font color="#af01c6">MAN:</font> <font color="#787878">Sorry.</font>

I might find platform 9 3/4?</font>

283
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:17,053
<font color="#787878">Think you're being funny, do you?</font>

284
00:32:17,303 --> 00:32:20,640
<font color="#af01c6">MRS. WEASLEY:</font> <font color="#787878">It's the same every year, packed with Muggles.</font>

<font color="#787878">All right, Percy, you first.</font>

287
00:32:43,287 --> 00:32:44,497
<font color="#787878">Fred, you next.</font>

288
00:32:44,705 --> 00:32:48,417
<font color="#787878">~ He's not Fred, I am.
~ You call yourself our mother?</font>

289
00:32:48,584 --> 00:32:50,586
<font color="#787878">I'm sorry, George.</font>

290
00:32:54,715 --> 00:32:57,093
<font color="#787878">I'm only joking. I am Fred.</font>

291
00:33:02,932 --> 00:33:05,518
<font color="#787878">Excuse me.</font>

292
00:33:06,602 --> 00:33:09,397
<font color="#787878">Could you tell me how to....?</font>

293
00:33:09,605 --> 00:33:13,109
<font color="#787878">How to get onto the platform? Not to worry, dear.</font>

294
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,820
<font color="#787878">It's Ron's first time
to Hogwarts as well.</font>

295
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:21,951
<font color="#787878">All you do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 
9 and 10.</font>

296
00:33:22,118 --> 00:33:25,621
<font color="#787878">~ Best to run if you're nervous.
~ Good luck.</font>

Everywhere else is full.</font>

298
00:34:27,683 --> 00:34:29,894
<font color="#787878">Not at all.</font>

<font color="#787878">I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley.</font>

302
00:34:41,906 --> 00:34:44,700

<font color="#787878">~ The what?
~ The scar?</font>

304
00:34:48,662 --> 00:34:50,706
<font color="#787878">Oh, yeah.</font>

305
00:34:51,332 --> 00:34:53,542
<font color="#787878">Wicked!</font>

306
00:34:56,003 --> 00:35:01,175

~ No, thanks. I'm all set.</font>

307
00:35:05,221 --> 00:35:07,515
<font color="#787878">We'll take the lot.</font>

308
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,560
<font color="#787878">Whoa.</font>

309

and peppermint and also....</font>

314

<font color="#787878">Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I've got about 500 meself.</font>

315
00:35:52,434 --> 00:35:54,728
<font color="#787878">Watch it!</font>

316
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:00,526
<font color="#787878">That's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them.</font>

319
00:36:10,786 --> 00:36:14,290
<font color="#787878">You can't expect him to
hang around all day, can you?</font>

320
00:36:14,915 --> 00:36:18,043
<font color="#787878">This is Scabbers. Pathetic, isn't he?</font>

321
00:36:18,252 --> 00:36:19,420
<font color="#787878">A little.</font>

322
00:36:19,628 --> 00:36:22,965
<font color="#787878">Fred gave me a spell
to turn him yellow. Want to see?</font>

323
00:36:23,132 --> 00:36:25,217
<font color="#787878">Yeah.</font>

324
00:36:31,974 --> 00:36:33,601
<font color="#787878">Has anyone seen a toad?</font>

325
00:36:33,976 --> 00:36:36,645
<font color="#787878">~ A boy named Neville's lost one.
~ No.</font>

326
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:41,567
<font color="#787878">Oh, are you doing magic?
Let's see, then.</font>

327
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:46,947
<font color="#787878">Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow</font>

328
00:36:47,156 --> 00:36:50,284
<font color="#787878">Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow</font>

329
00:36:53,037 --> 00:36:58,667
<font color="#787878">Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, 
is it?</font>

330
00:36:58,834 --> 00:37:02,129
<font color="#787878">I've only tried
a few simple ones myself....</font>

331
00:37:02,338 --> 00:37:04,965
<font color="#787878">....but they've all worked for me.</font>

332
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:10,638
<font color="#787878">For example:</font>

333
00:37:11,013 --> 00:37:13,807
<font color="#787878">Oculus Reparo.</font>

334
00:37:15,851 --> 00:37:18,520
<font color="#787878">That's better, isn't it?</font>

335
00:37:19,688 --> 00:37:23,609
<font color="#787878">Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!</font>

336
00:37:23,817 --> 00:37:27,363
<font color="#787878">I'm Hermione Granger.
And you are....?</font>

337
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:31,325
<font color="#787878">~ I’m Ron Weasley.
~ Pleasure.</font>

338
00:37:31,533 --> 00:37:36,622
<font color="#787878">You two better change into robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon.</font>

339
00:37:40,709 --> 00:37:44,213
<font color="#787878">You've got dirt on your nose. Did you know?</font>

340
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,382
<font color="#787878">Just there.</font>

341
00:37:58,727 --> 00:38:02,523
<font color="#787878">Right, then.
First years, this way, please!</font>

342
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:07,903
<font color="#787878">Come on, first years, don't be shy. Come on now, hurry up.</font>

343
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,913
<font color="#787878">~ Hello, Harry.
~ Hi, Hagrid.</font>

344
00:38:18,122 --> 00:38:19,164
<font color="#787878">Whoa.</font>

345
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:23,335
<font color="#787878">Right, then. This way to the boats. Come on now, follow me.</font>

346
00:38:52,114 --> 00:38:53,574
<font color="#787878">Wow.</font>

347
00:39:09,048 --> 00:39:10,799
<font color="#787878">Wicked.</font>

348
00:39:38,994 --> 00:39:41,246
<font color="#787878">Welcome to Hogwarts.</font>

349
00:39:41,455 --> 00:39:45,459
<font color="#787878">Shortly, you'll pass through these doors and join your classmates.</font>

350
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:50,714
<font color="#787878">But before you take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses.</font>

351
00:39:50,923 --> 00:39:54,009
<font color="#787878">They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff....</font>

352
00:39:54,259 --> 00:39:58,722
<font color="#787878">....Ravenclaw and Slytherin.</font>

353
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:04,186
<font color="#787878">While you're here, your house will be like your family.</font>

354
00:40:04,812 --> 00:40:08,315
<font color="#787878">Your triumphs will earn you points.</font>

355
00:40:08,524 --> 00:40:12,653
<font color="#787878">Any rule-breaking
and you will lose points.</font>

356
00:40:12,861 --> 00:40:18,158
<font color="#787878">At the end of the year, the house with the most points wins 
the house cup.</font>

357
00:40:18,367 --> 00:40:19,701
<font color="#787878">Trevor!</font>

358
00:40:28,627 --> 00:40:30,254
<font color="#787878">Sorry.</font>

359
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:34,383
<font color="#787878">The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.</font>

360
00:40:35,759 --> 00:40:39,054
<font color="#787878">It's true then,
what they're saying on the train.</font>

361
00:40:39,513 --> 00:40:42,141
<font color="#787878">Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.</font>

362
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:43,767
<font color="#787878">Harry Potter?</font>

363
00:40:44,393 --> 00:40:47,062
<font color="#787878">This is Crabbe and Goyle.</font>

364
00:40:47,271 --> 00:40:49,565
<font color="#787878">And I'm Malfoy.</font>

365
00:40:49,898 --> 00:40:52,234
<font color="#787878">Draco Malfoy.</font>

366
00:40:54,194 --> 00:40:57,781
<font color="#787878">Think my name's funny, do you? I've no need to ask yours.</font>

367
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:03,787
<font color="#787878">Red hair and a hand-me-down robe? You must be a Weasley.</font>

368
00:41:04,705 --> 00:41:08,750
<font color="#787878">You'll find out some wizarding families are better than others.</font>

369
00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:12,754
<font color="#787878">You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort.</font>

370
00:41:12,921 --> 00:41:15,090
<font color="#787878">I can help you there.</font>

371
00:41:17,342 --> 00:41:21,180
<font color="#787878">I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks.</font>

372
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:29,021
<font color="#787878">We're ready for you now.
Follow me.</font>

373
00:41:47,623 --> 00:41:52,127

1115
02:01:36,657 --> 02:01:40,744
<font color="#787878">It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room.</font>

<font color="#787878">Harry, you take
the empty bishop's square.</font>

1230
02:15:51,427 --> 02:15:55,974

would be able to get it.</font>

1231
02:15:56,933 --> 02:16:00,436

<font color="#787878">And between you and me,
that is saying something.</font>

1233
02:16:07,110 --> 02:16:12,365
<font color="#787878">Does that mean, with the Stone gone, that Voldemort can never come back?</font>

1234
02:16:12,574 --> 02:16:14,909
<font color="#787878">I'm afraid....</font>

1235
02:16:16,286 --> 02:16:20,373
<font color="#787878">....there are ways
in which he can return.</font>

1236
02:16:21,082 --> 02:16:23,626
<font color="#787878">Harry, do you know why....</font>

1237
02:16:23,877 --> 02:16:27,881
<font color="#787878">....Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him?</font>

1238
02:16:28,089 --> 02:16:32,719
<font color="#787878">It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you.</font>

1239
02:16:33,261 --> 02:16:36,472
<font color="#787878">And that kind of act leaves a mark.</font>

1240
02:16:36,639 --> 02:16:40,476
<font color="#787878">No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.</font>

1241
02:16:40,643 --> 02:16:45,607
<font color="#787878">~ It lives in your very skin.
~ What is it?</font>

1242
02:16:46,441 --> 02:16:50,153
<font color="#787878">Love, Harry. Love.</font>

1243
02:16:58,244 --> 02:17:02,332
<font color="#787878">Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.</font>

1244
02:17:02,582 --> 02:17:07,253
<font color="#787878">I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit-flavored one.</font>

1245
02:17:07,503 --> 02:17:10,798
<font color="#787878">And since then,
I've lost my liking for them.</font>

1246
02:17:11,007 --> 02:17:14,344
<font color="#787878">But I think I could be safe....</font>

02:17:14,594 --> 02:17:16,971
<font color="#787878">....with a nice toffee.</font>

1248
02:17:19,682 --> 02:17:22,602
<font color="#787878">Hm, alas!</font>

~ All right. You?</font>

1251
02:17:44,958 --> 02:17:47,669
<font color="#787878">All right. Hermione?</font>

1252
02:17:48,336 --> 02:17:50,171
<font color="#787878">Never better.</font>

1253
02:18:05,979 --> 02:18:08,398
<font color="#787878">Another year gone.</font>

1254
02:18:09,190 --> 02:18:13,736
<font color="#787878">And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding.</font>

1255
02:18:13,903 --> 02:18:16,572
<font color="#787878">And the points stand thus:</font>

1256
02:18:16,739 --> 02:18:22,578
<font color="#787878">In fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.</font>

1261

<font color="#787878">....with 472 points, Slytherin house.</font>

1262
02:19:01,034 --> 02:19:03,244
<font color="#787878">Nice one, mate.</font>

1263
02:19:07,081 --> 02:19:11,169
<font color="#787878">Yes, well done, Slytherin. Well done.</font>

1264
02:19:11,419 --> 02:19:15,715
<font color="#787878">However, recent events must be taken into account.</font>

1265
02:19:15,923 --> 02:19:20,887
<font color="#787878">And I have a few last-minute points to award.</font>

<font color="#787878">To Miss Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect....</font>

<font color="#787878">....5() points.</font>

1269
02:19:33,900 --> 02:19:35,193
<font color="#787878">Good job.</font>

1270
02:19:42,909 --> 02:19:48,956
<font color="#787878">Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best-played game of chess....</font>

<font color="#787878">We're tied with Slytherin!</font>

1277
02:20:25,201 --> 02:20:31,207
<font color="#787878">Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies....</font>

1278
02:20:31,374 --> 02:20:35,294
<font color="#787878">....but a great deal more to stand up to your friends.</font>
