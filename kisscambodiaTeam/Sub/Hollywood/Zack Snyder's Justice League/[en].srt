00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
you've been working as if there's no tomorrow

377
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
to build this team

379
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000

00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Just because Lex Luthor says

381

382

This has nothing to do with Lex Luthor.

383

Well, it's been some time since Luthor's warning.

388
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
No attacks. No barbarians at the gate.

389
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Maybe these barbarians don't use a gate.

390

00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
[Steppenwolf] This world is divided.

560
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
They are a primitive species.

561
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Unevolved and at war with one another.

562
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Too separate to be one.

563
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Their free will must be ripped from them,

564
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
like the other worlds.

565
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Given absolution in one glorious belief,

566
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
to serve him.

567
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
The Mother Boxes?

568
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I have found one of the three.

569
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
The one that woke and called to me.

570
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
The other two still sleep,

571
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
but the parademons feel their presence.

572
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
They fly,

573
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
they search, they take prisoners who carry the scent,

574
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,000
while I build a stronghold in the name of his glory.

575
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Yes.

576
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Mighty Steppenwolf,

577
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
who might have sat here by the side of the great one.

578
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,000
But undone by his self-pride.

579
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
DeSaad...

580
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I fall before you.

581
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Let me make a plea to him

582
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
that I may come home

583
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
after I take this world in his name.

584
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
You betrayed him.

585
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Your own family.

586
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I saw my mistake.

587
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I slaughtered those who sought his throne.

588
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,000
You still owe the great one 50,000 more worlds.

589
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
He will hear your plea

590
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
when you pay your debt.

591
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
The Mother Boxes will be found and united.

592
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
No protectors here.

593
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
No Lanterns, no Kryptonian.

594
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,000
This world will fall, like all the others.

595
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
For Darkseid.

596
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
For Darkseid.

597
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
You know, I paid millions of dollars

598
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
for this building's security.

599
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
[Diana] You got your money's worth.

600
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Took me almost a minute to disable it.

601
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Hi there.

602
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
A new toy?

603
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Prototype troop carrier.

604
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
[sighs] I once knew a man

605
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
who would have loved to fly it.

606
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
The best minds at Wayne Aerospace

607
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
couldn't make it fly.

608
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
But you can?

609
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I have no choice.

610
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
I need more range and I need more cargo.

611
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I think there's an attack coming.

612
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Not coming, Bruce.

613
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
It's already here.

614
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
From what I've learned,

615
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
they are things from another universe.

616
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
They serve a dark power.

617
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
An old power.

618
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
[Bruce] What do they want?

619
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
[Diana sighs] To invade. To conquer.

620
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
They came here once before, long ago.

621
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
A great armada appeared in the sky,

622
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
laying waste to all who opposed it.

623
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:21,000
The leader of the invaders was a being called Darkseid.

624
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,000
A name cursed and feared in every universe.

625
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Darkseid was met in battle by Earth's defenders.

626
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
The old gods, men...

627
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Atlanteans before their descent into the sea...

628
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Amazons before their betrayal and enslavement

629
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
and guardians from the stars.

630
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Their histories had taught them

631
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
not to trust each other,

632
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
not to hope for an alliance.

633
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
To fight apart.

634
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
[door hisses]

635
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
[Darkseid breathing heavily]

636
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
[yells]

637
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
[Diana]  As Darkseid waged war on Earth,

638
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
he found a secret there.

639
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
A power hidden in the infinity of space.

640
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
He called forth mystics

641
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,000
who worshipped and controlled three objects...

642
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
the Mother Boxes.

643
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Wait, wait, wait.

644
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
"Mother Boxes"?

645
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Indestructible living machines,

646
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
made from a science so advanced,

647
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
it looks like sorcery.

648
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,000
To conquer, three boxes have to synchronize

649
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
and join together into The Unity.

650
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
The Unity cleanses a planet with fire,

651
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
transforming it into a copy of the enemy's world.

652
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,000
All who live become servants of Darkseid.

653
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Alive but drained of life.

654
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Parademons.

655
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
[horse whinnying]

656
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
-Amazons! -[Amazons shouting]

657
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
[Atlanteans yelling]

658
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
With me!

659
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
[all yelling]

660
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
[Zeus growling]

661
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
[parademons screeching]

662
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
[Amazons yelling]

663
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
[Diana]  But before The Unity could synchronize,

664
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
the defenders of Earth attacked

665
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
and fought as one.

666
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Amazons alongside Atlanteans.

667
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Zeus and his son Ares

668
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,000
alongside the guardians from the sky.

669
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
A golden Age of Heroes fighting together

670
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
to defend life on Earth.

671
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
[men yelling]

672
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
[man groaning]

673
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
[Darkseid grunting]

674
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
[Darkseid grunting]

675
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
[groans]

676
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
[Atlantean king yells]

677
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
[growls]

678
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
[yells]

679
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
[Darkseid grunts]

680
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
[straining]

681
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
[both growling]

682
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
[yells]

683
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
[Darkseid groaning]

684
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
[grunting]

685
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
[Atlantean king yells]

686
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
[Amazons grunting]

687
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
[yells]

688
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
[yelling]

689
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
[parademon screeching]

690
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
[Diana]  They did what no world had ever done.

691
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Sent the enemies back into the stars.

692
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
[yells]

693
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
The three Mother Boxes never synchronized.

694
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
-The Unity never came to pass. -[all yelling]

695
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,000
But, in their retreat,

696
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,000
the boxes were left behind on Earth.

697
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,000
They grew weak. Dogs without masters

698
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
falling asleep,

699
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
awaiting their return.

700
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Fading from the view of the enemy,

701
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
anonymous among a trillion worlds.

702
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
[Mother Boxes pulsing]

703
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
The defenders of Earth made a vow.

704
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Men, Atlanteans, and Amazons.

705
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Each would enshrine and guard

706
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
one of the three sleeping Mother Boxes

707
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
according to the rites and rituals of their culture

708
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
in case a box should ever wake again

709
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
to call out to the planet Apokolips

710
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
to return and conquer

711
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,000
the only world Darkseid had ever lost.

712
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Something woke the box my people guard.

713
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
It called out to the dark place...

714
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
to one of Darkseid's conquerors.

715
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
The enemy is here.

716
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
If he's here, where is he?

717
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
He'll be searching for the other two boxes.

718
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Hiding until he has all three. Until he's ready.

719
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Then we have to be ready. You, me, the others.

720
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
They said the Age of Heroes would never come again.

721
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
No, it will.

722
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
It has to.

723
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
The others. Where are they?

724
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
[Barry] Am I late?

725
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
No, I'm so late. I'm very late.

726
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Oh, hey, buddy. Hey.

727
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
-Oh. No. -[barking]

728
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
-[yelps] -[woman] Okay, bye. Okay.

729
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
-I'm so sorry. -[chuckles]

730
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I'm late.

731
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
-Are you, uh... -I'm...

732
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I'm so sorry I'm so late. I didn't mean to be so late.

733
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I'm me and I'm here and I'm so sorry I'm late.

734
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Essentially, the bus didn't come,

735
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
then the bus did come,

736
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
but then there was this old woman

737
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
counting change for the fare,

738
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
like, nickel, penny, nickel, penny.

739
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Like, jeez Louise, let this woman on the bus.

740
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
She's 107 years old,

741
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
these are some of her last few moments of life.

742
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Resume.

743

The world's monetary systems

927
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
and its complex interactions

928
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
will seem as easy to manipulate for you

929
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
as a child's plaything.

930
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
[grunts]

931
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:49,000
The question... No, the challenge

932
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
won't be doing it.

933
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
It will be not doing.

934
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Not seeing.

935
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
It is the burden of this responsibility

936
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,000
that will define you and who you choose to be.

937
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
[woman]  Now, make a wish.

938
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
[child blows air]

939
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
One more time.

940
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Good job. Wave to Grandma!

941
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Hi, Grandma!

942
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
[squeals] What?

943
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
[gasps]

944
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
[laughs] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

945
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Oh, my God.

946
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

947
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
[Silas]  Victor...

948
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Victor, these are the words and deductions of a scientist.

949
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
That's how I've been speaking to you.

950
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Now,

951
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,000
[continues over tape]  let me speak to you from my heart,

952
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,000
not as a scientist,

953
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
as a father.

954
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
[parademon screeches]

955
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,000
[man] Hey.

956
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Hey, you!

957
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
[hand blaster charging up]

958
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
[siren wailing]

959
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
[parademon snarls]

960
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
[hand blaster powers down]

961
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,000
[Henry]  Because you are holding yourself back.

962
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,000
You're going in circles, man.

963
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Holding down three dead-end jobs,

964
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000
going on four.

965
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Where do you even find the time?

966
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,000
[Barry] I make the time.

967
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,000
-I just need one more gig... -Barry.

968
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:08,000
...then I'm gonna pay for my own tuition.

969
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
[Henry] You can't.

970
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
[Barry] Like I always said I would.

971
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
You cannot keep doing this to yourself.

972
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Okay. I really don't wanna talk about this again.

973
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
-Please, we have 10 minutes. -And this is all to pay

974
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
for a criminal justice degree, huh?

975
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Yeah.

976
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
For what?

977
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Huh, let's see. As I talk to my father,

978
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
who's still in prison for the murder

979
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
of my mother, which he didn't commit.

980
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Yeah, how did I get interested in criminal justice?

981
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
I can't remember.

982
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Oh, boy.

983
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
This path has clearly chosen me, Dad.

984
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Give me your hand, man.

985
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
[sighs] I want you to listen to me, Barry.

986
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:48,000
I want you to listen to me, because I mean this.

987
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
I want you to give all that up.

988
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,000
And I want you to stop coming to see me.

989
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,000
I am a drag on your life.

990
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
[sighs]

991
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Okay. Um...

992
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Please don't ever say that to me again.

993
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Please.

994
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Hey, you know what criminal justice

995
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
would be for me?

996
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:28,000
My son not wasting his life.

997
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
You can be whatever you wanna be.

998
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
You're brilliant, man.

999
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Absolute best of the best.

1000
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:44,000
I can't sit here and watch you run in place in Central City

1001
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
for some old dude

1002
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
who's not going anywhere.

1003
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
-Dad, that's not true. -[prison guard] It's time.

1004
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
That's not true.

1005
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
[prison guard] Let's go, Allen. Allen!

1006
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
I want you to make your own future.

1007
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
You're living in the past. Make your own future.

1008
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
[prison guard] Open gate.

1009
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Great.

1010
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
[gate buzzing]

1011
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
"You're living in the past. Make your own future, Barry."

1012
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
[prison guard] Clear. Close the gate.

1013
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
[gate closes]

1014
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
[train horn blaring]

1015
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
[locks door]

1016
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
[opens electric panel]

1017
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
[system powers up]

1018
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Barry Allen. Bruce Wayne.

1019
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
You said that like it explains

1020
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
why there's a total stranger in my place

1021
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,000
sitting in the dark, in my second favorite chair.

1022
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
[paper rustles]

1023
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Tell me about this.

1024
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,000
This is a person who looks exactly like me,

1025
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,000
but who is definitely not me.

1026
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Somebody... I don't know.

1027
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Hippie, long hair.

1028
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Very attractive Jewish boy.

1029
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Who drinks milk, I don't drink milk.

1030
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
I know you have abilities.

1031
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
I just don't know what they are.

1032
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
My special skills

1033
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,000
include viola, web design,

1034
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,000
fluent in sign language, gorilla sign language.

1035
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,000
[Bruce] Silica-based sand quartz fabric.

1036
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Abrasion resistant, heat resistant.

1037
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Uh, yeah, I do competitive ice dancing.

1038
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
It's what they use on the space shuttle

1039
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
to prevent it from burning up on re-entry.

1040
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
I do very competitive ice dancing.

1041
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Look, man. I don't know who you are,

1042
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
but whoever you're looking for,

1043
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,000
it's not me.

1044
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
[electricity crackles]

1045
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
[exhales sharply]

1046
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
You're the Batman?

1047
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,000
So, you're fast.

1048
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
That feels like an oversimplification.

1049
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
I'm putting together a team.

1050
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,000
People with special abilities.

1051
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
You see, I believe enemies are coming.

1052
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Stop right there. I'm in.

1053
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
You are?

1054
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Just like that?

1055
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Yeah. [hesitates]

1056
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,000
I need friends.

1057
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Great. Great.

1058
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Can I keep this?

1059
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
It's like this layer of dimensional reality,

1060
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,000
and it seems to manipulate space-time.

1061
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,000
I call it the Speed Force.

1062
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Causes me to burn a tremendous amount of calories

1063
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,000
so I am just a black hole of snacks.

1064
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
I am a snack hole.

1065
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,000
How many people are on this special fight team?

1066
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
-Three, including you. -Three?

1067
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Against what?

1068
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I'll tell you on the plane.

1069
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Plane?

1070
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
What are your superpowers again?

1071
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
I'm rich.

1072
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
[engine starts]

1073
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
[tires screeching]

1074
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
[car horn blares]

1075
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
[kettle whistles]

1076
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
[whistling stops]

1077
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Oh, Miss Prince, let me do that.

1078
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,000
[Diana] No, that's okay. I can do it myself.

1079
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
[sniffs] Would you like to have some?

1080
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Uh, no, thank you.

1081
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
If you put the water in first.

1082
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,000
-[Diana] Of course. -So we don't scald the tea.

1083
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
-Yes. -Great.

1084
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
No, that's probably enough tea.

1085
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
[Diana] All right.

1086
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Are you sure you don't wanna have some?

1087
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:42,000
I won't, thank you. And then leave it to mash.

1088
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,000
I will. I will, definitely will.

1089
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Uh... What are you working on?

1090
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
It's a gauntlet

1091
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:53,000
lined with specialized polymer solar cells.

1092
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:56,000
-Wow. -Here, let me show you.

1093
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
We borrowed this from the Kryptonian scout ship.

1094
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,000
[Alfred chuckles]

1095
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Oh, maybe you should, uh...

1096
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
a fraction. Thank you, thank you.

1097
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Of course.

1098
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
[buzzing and crackling]

1099
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
[Alfred] Ah.

1100
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Ah, now, let's see how that did.

1101
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
-[device beeps] -Ha! Yes.

1102
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Not to be sneezed at.

1103
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:22,000
A gauntlet that captures and dissipates energy.

1104
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,000
It's Master Wayne's idea.

1105
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Maybe you should work on a lasso, too?

1108

1110
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Something is not working.

1111
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
[Alfred] Mmm.

1112
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
[system warbling]

1113
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Looks like you have a date, Miss Prince.

[electricity crackles]

1116
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Why are you looking for me, Diana?

1117
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,000
You know who I am.

1118
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
I know more than you can possibly imagine.

1119
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Then maybe you already know I need your help.

1120
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
The world does.

1121
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Fuck the world.

1122
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:27,000
[Diana] You've obviously been through a great deal.

1123
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,000
I can't begin to imagine what.

1124
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:35,000
But whatever happened to you, you have gifts now.

1125
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Gifts?

1126
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,000
What part of this looks like a gift to you?

1127
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
We need you, Victor.

1128
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,000
And maybe you need us.

1129
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
I don't need anyone.

1130
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Not anymore.

1131
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I told myself the same for a long time.

1132
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,000
I lost someone I loved once.

1133
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:07,000
I shut myself off from everyone.

1134
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,000
But I had to learn to open back up again.

1135
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:18,000
The truth is, I'm still working on it.

1136
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:22,000
And if you asked to meet me...

1137
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,000
you're working on it, too.

1138
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
[grunting]

1139
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
You were right about the metal sample

1140
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
from the Superman ship.

1141
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:44,000
When we bombard it with X-rays from the electron-laser,

1142
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
look what happens.

3.5 million kelvin.

1146
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,000
The inner core of the metal becomes superheated.

1147
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Hot, dense matter.

1148
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,000
You're looking at the hottest thing on Earth.

1149
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Exact words I said to my prom date.

1150
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
She dumped me anyway.

1151
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Yeah.

1152
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,000
[laser shuts down]

1153
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Hey, Doc,

1154
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,000
do you think Batman is connected

1155
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,000
to the object the CID is looking for?

1156
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,000
You know, 6-1-9-8-2?

1157
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
No...

1158
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
I don't.

1159
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Oh, Victor.

[female officer] Commissioner Gordon?

1165
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
[officer] Come on!

1166
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Your messages.

1167
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000

Don't have to see the sky to know it's a full moon.

1170
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Half of Gotham's reality-challenged

1171
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,000
community showed up.

1172
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Say they saw flying monsters by the harbor.

1173
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
You were right, Ma. Police Academy.

1174
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
What's wrong with dental school?

1175
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,000
"Attacked by a flying vampire."

1176
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,000

-Looks like... -I know what it looks like,

1181

Crispus.

1182
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Come on, you think he fights criminals for 20 years here

1183
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,000
and then he goes to Metropolis and kidnaps eight people?

1184
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
I'll talk to him tonight.

1185
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,000
How, Jim?

1186
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
How do you think?

-[Barry] Oh, my goodness. -[Bruce] Where's the cyborg?

1194
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
His name is Victor.

1195
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,000
We met, spoke.

1196
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Give him time.

1197
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
You must be Barry. I'm Diana.

1198
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Hi, Barry. I'm Diana. That's not right. Great.

Awesome! It's the Bat-Signal. That's your...

1202
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Oh, sorry. [softly] That's your signal.

1203
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
That means we have to go now.

1204
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,000

the perimeter guards were taken.

1210

He won't send reinforcements.

1211
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,000
He says all the reserves are needed in the rebel regions.

1212
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,000
He's as shortsighted as he is cruel. [sighs]

1213
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
All right, take what men we have left

1214
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
and form a phalanx around the Mother Box.

The firstborn of beloved Queen Atlanna.

1234
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Wait.

1235
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Please.

1236
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,000
I knew her.

1237

Well, that makes one of us.

1238
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,000
My parents died in the wars.

1239
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
She took me in.

1240

What a saint.

1241
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
You dare speak of Queen Atlanna that way?

1242
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Your queen left me on my father's doorstep

1243
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
and never gave me another thought.

1244
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Your mother left you to save your life.

1245
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,000
You cannot imagine how it hurt her.

1246

What it cost her.

1247
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:06,000
But you're not a defenseless child now.

1248
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,000
It would have been her responsibility

1249
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:13,000
to follow that monster to the surface and stop him.

1250
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000

[Steppenwolf] Two boxes found and awake.

1261
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,000
With the combined power of the two Mother Boxes,

1262
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:58,000
I've been able to finish the stronghold's defenses.

1263
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Where is the third Mother Box?

1264
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:04,000
The parademons sense its presence

1265
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,000
and search for the third.

1266
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
They have taken prisoners

1267
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
who carry its scent.

1268
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Go.

1269
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Interrogate the prisoners.

1270
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Find the third.

1271
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:20,000
They will tell me what they know,

1272
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,000
or I will rip it from them.

How many of you are there?

1277
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Not enough.

1278
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,000

Parademons.

1282
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Okay.

1283
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:24,000
The demons must have caught the scent of a Mother Box.

1284

[The Flash] At the lab.

1285
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000

So the eight may still be alive.

1287
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:30,000
[Victor] Nine.

1288
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,000
[The Flash gasps] Oh.

1289
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
The head of STARLABS was taken tonight.

1290
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Wow, okay. So, another scientist.

1291
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,000
So, how do we find him?

1292
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,000
There must be a nest nearby.

1293
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:49,000
I plotted all the sightings in Metropolis, Gotham.

1294
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
No discernable pattern I can see.

1295
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:53,000
The lines on the map don't converge.

1296
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
On land.

1297
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,000
These lead back to Stryker's Island,

1298
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
between the two cities.

1299
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,000
These are air vents.

1300
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:00,000
They all lead down to the tunnel

1301
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,000
to a Metropolis project that was abandoned in '29.

1302
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
[Wonder Woman] The nest could be there.

1303
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
[The Flash] Uh, is he coming with us now,

1304
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
because we're not all gonna fit in your car.

1305
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
I have something bigger.

1306
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Do you really think that...

1307
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Oh, wow, they just... They really just vanish, huh?

1308
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Oh. That's rude.

1309
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
[rats squeaking]

1310
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,000
[door whirs]

1311
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
[dramatic rock music playing]

1312
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
We're close.

1313
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
The scent of the enemy.

1314
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Of absence.

1315
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Darkness.

1316
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Death.

1317
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Where are we, Alfred?

1318
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,000
[Alfred over radio] Stryker's Island.

1319
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,000
You should be directly under

1320
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
the venting tower for the tunnel.

1321
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Now look to your left,

1322
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
you'll see a staircase to the machine room.

1323
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Thermal scan shows a cluster of people there.

1324
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,000
[Batman] That's it.

1325
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Let's go.

1326
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
[dramatic rock music resumes]

1327
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,000
[The Flash] Right. Is there... Is there a plan?

1328
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Either of you?

1329
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
[Wonder Woman] Don't engage alone.

1330
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,000
We do this together.

1331
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
I heard about you.

1332
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Didn't think you were real.

1333
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,000
I'm real when it's useful.

1334
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
[Steppenwolf] I grow tired of your silence.

1335
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Now tell me, where is the Mother Box?

1336
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,000
[parademons chittering]

1337
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,000
[hostages whimpering]

1338
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Please. We have families.

1339
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Then you have weakness.

1340
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Steppenwolf.

1341
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Okay, I'm guessing that's the bad guy.

1342
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Good guess.

1343
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:42,000
I'm really, really missing Superman right now.

1344
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Circle to the other side.

1345
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,000
We'll surround them and surprise him.

1346
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
[shuddering]

1347
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
You have been near a Mother Box.

1348
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
The scent is on you.

1349
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

1350
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
-Where is it? -[Silas] Leave him alone!

1351
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:01,000
He... He doesn't know.

1352

1353
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000

[Silas grunting]

1356
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,000
[Steppenwolf] You carry the scent, too. But stronger.

1357
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
I will die before I tell you.

1358
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
You'll die if you don't.

1359
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
No!

1360
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
[all exclaim]

1361
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Victor.

1362
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,000
[Steppenwolf] Kill them both.

1363

Ah, Amazon.

1366
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:41,000
But not like your sisters.

1367
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Stronger.

Hold!

1377
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
This one will be mine.

1378
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
I belong to no one.

Guys, this is not together.

1382
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Help get those people out of here.

1383
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
I'll make sure these things follow me. [grunts]

[Cyborg] Everybody, move!

1387
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,000
A little quicker.

1388
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,000
-Are you good? -Yeah.

1389
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:21,000
I've got this. Keep moving.

1390
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,000
[The Flash] This way.

1398

Celebrate later, Alfred. I need the Nightcrawler.

1399
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Thought you'd never ask.

1400

They're safe. Get back to the tunnel.

Mm.

02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
[roaring]

1471
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
[helicopter whirring]

1472
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Sir, you're gonna be in quarantine

1473
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,000
for possible alien microbes.

1474
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
U.S. government protocols require that...

1475
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:13,000
I know the requirements. I wrote them.

1476
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
[Wonder Woman] It called to him.

1477
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:20,000
The Mother Box.

1478
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:22,000
The one he already has.

1479
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:25,000
He has two. He took the Mother Box from Atlantis.

1480
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:28,000
All he needs now is the lost Box of Men.

1481
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,000
If he doesn't already have it.

1482
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:34,000
He doesn't have it.

1483
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:39,000
I do.

1484
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Have you finished the conquest?

1485
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
Not yet, DeSaad.

1486
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Then why do you summon me?

1487
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
I bring news.

1488
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Before mighty Darkseid came to the throne,

1489
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:05,000
he searched the universe for the ultimate weapon.

1490
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
The Anti-Life Equation.

1491
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
The key to controlling all life

1492
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
and all will throughout the multiverse.

1493
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:15,000
He found it hidden on a primitive planet,

1494
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:15,000
but before...

1495
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:19,000
The story of the defiance is well-known.

1496
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
I have found the primitive planet.

1497
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:24,000
The world that fought back.

1498
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:25,000
It is Earth.

1499
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
The Anti-Life Equation is carved

1500
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:32,000
into the surface of this very world.

1501
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:33,000
[snarls]

1502
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Are you certain?

1503
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:38,000
I have seen it.

1504
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:42,000
I have looked with my own eyes.

1505
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:43,000
[speaks alien language]

1506
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:44,000
[Steppenwolf speaks alien language]

1507
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Anti-Life.

1508
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:47,000
[speaking alien language]

1509
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
[growls]

1510
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
[parademons chittering]

1511
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:07,000
[dramatic orchestral music playing]

1512
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
[gasping]

1513
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
My lord.

1514
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Oh, Steppenwolf.

1515
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:36,000
[Steppenwolf] My lord, I am but your humble servant.

1516
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Can it be true that you have found it?

1517
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:42,000
[Steppenwolf] I have, great one.

1518
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:46,000
The lost world is Earth.

1519
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Anti-Life is here.

1520
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:53,000
If it is redemption you seek, find the third box,

1521
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:56,000
synchronize The Unity, and when this world

1522
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:56,000
is scorched,

1523
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:00,000
I will come for my great prize.

1524
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:04,000
You will come to Earth?

1525
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:08,000
I have turned 100,000 worlds to dust

1526
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
looking for Anti-Life.

1527
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Looking for those who robbed me of my glory.

1528
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:17,000
I will stride across their bones

1529
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
and bask in the glow of Anti-Life.

1530
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:22,000
And all of existence

1531
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:26,000
shall be mine.

1532
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:27,000
[grunts softly]

1533
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:33,000
It shall be so, my master.

1534
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
[Barry] So cool.

1535
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:42,000
From the outside, it looks like this building

1536
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:42,000
was abandoned.

1537
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
It wants to fly.

1538
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
You talk to machines?

1539
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:53,000
[Victor] I speak to intelligence.

1540
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:54,000
This one's saying she can't fly

1541
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
because of a software issue,

1542
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
but I could fix it with a little time.

1543
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:10,000
There's a dark spot in my data stream.

1544
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
I could feel the other two boxes.

1545
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
I know they're awake,

1546
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
but I can't see where they are.

1547
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Well, we can't attack unless we know where the base is.

1548
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
Even if we knew,

1549
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:24,000
I've never seen a being as strong as Steppenwolf.

1550
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Maybe one.

1551
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:30,000
Hmm, Superman.

1552
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:31,000
[Victor] As long as the third box is asleep,

1553
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:34,000
they can't see it, only sense it.

1554
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
We need to keep moving so they can't catch up.

1555
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
No. That's just a strategy

1556
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
to lose more slowly, not to win.

1557
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Remind me, are flamethrowers not a thing?

1558
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Why don't we just destroy it?

1559
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Fire doesn't destroy the boxes.

1560
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
They're an unknown form of matter.

1561
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,000
Oh, they love heat.

1562
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:52,000
They absorb it, hold it in their cores.

1563
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Well, you know a lot about these boxes.

1564
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Makes you think.

1565
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Where'd you find the box, Victor?

1566
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Are you trying to say something?

1567
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Oh, I'm saying it.

1568
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
How do we know you're not working for them?

1569
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
It's a long story.

1570
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
You got somewhere else to be?

1571
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:19,000
The Nazis found the box

1572
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
at the end of the Second World War,

1573
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:25,000
buried under an Italian monastery.

1574
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
The Allies intercepted it on its way to Hitler.

1575
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:30,000
They brought it back to the States in '44.

1576
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:34,000
Unknown object 6-1-9-8-2.

1577
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
It collected dust in the Pentagon archives

1578
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:38,000
for 70 years

1579
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:42,000
till DoD began to study the Superman ship.

1580
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:46,000
A researcher at STARLABS made a connection

1581
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:47,000
between the ship...

1582
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
and 6-1-9-8-2.

1583
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:54,000
He understood they were both alien technologies.

1584
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Different civilizations,

1585
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:59,000
similar properties.

1586
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:03,000
And though the box had slept for thousands of years,

1587
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:07,000
the researcher formulated a theory on how to awaken it.

1588
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
And so did.

1589
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Then...

1590
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:17,000
I had an accident that should've killed me.

1591
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:20,000
But in an act of desperation or madness,

1592
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:23,000
the researcher harnessed the power of the Mother Box.

1593
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:26,000
[powering up]

1594
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:34,000
[screaming]

1595
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
He unleashed an alien technology

1596
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:44,000
he didn't fully understand.

1597
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:47,000
He used that power to keep me alive.

1598
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
-[groans] -[power turns off]

1599
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Alive...

1600
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
but turned into this.

1601
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
The box went back to sleep

1602
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
and he never returned it.

1603
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:07,000
That researcher was Silas Stone.

1604
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
My father.

1605
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
Wait,

1606
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:18,000
your father saved your life with one of these things?

1607
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:21,000
Aren't they psycho murder machines?

1608
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
They're change machines.

1609
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:26,000
The boxes don't think in terms of healing or killing,

1610
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:28,000
alive or dead.

1611
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
They rearrange matter at the will of their masters,

1612
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
regenerate, reinstate.

1613
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:34,000
Reinstate?

1614
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
[Victor] A box has the power

1615
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
to reinstate anterior particle relationships.

1616
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
So, you mean in the way that particles of matter

1617
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:41,000
can't be created or destroyed,

1618
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
their relations just transform.

1619
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:46,000
Burn down a house, the particles still exist.

1620
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Particles of house become particles of smoke.

1621
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:53,000
Anybody with a match can turn a house to smoke.

1622
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
But a Mother Box...

1623
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
...turns smoke back into a house.

1624
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,000
[sighs]

1625
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:08,000
I know we're all thinking the same thing right now.

1626
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Who's gonna say it? I'm not gonna say it.

1627
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
[orchestral music playing]

1628
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:40,000
[Lois] Who is it?

1629
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Martha.

1630
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Hi.

1631
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:51,000
[softly] Hi.

1632
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
I went to the  Daily Planet

1633
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:06,000
to finally pick up Clark's things. [chuckles]

1634
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:10,000
I don't know why, nowhere to put them now.

1635
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
I lost the farm.

1636
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
I'd been behind on the payments for a while.

1637
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:21,000
Truth is, the house is too big

1638
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:24,000
for me to live in by myself anyway.

1639
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:27,000
Well, you know you're welcome to stay here any time

1640
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
for as long as you need.

1641
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Thank you, Lois. That's very kind.

1642
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:37,000
But I've found a little place that suits me just fine,

1643
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
right by the diner.

1644
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:40,000
I'm not here for help.

1645
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
I'm here because

1646
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:47,000
when I saw Mr. Perry, he told me that

1647
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:51,000
you haven't been to work since Clark died.

1648
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:55,000
[sighs softly]

1649
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
I can't.

1650
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:07,000
The whole world is mourning.

1651
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:08,000
[sighs]

1652
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:11,000
Grieving over a symbol.

1653
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Everywhere I go, everywhere I look, I see that "S."

1654
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
I hear what people say.

1655
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
They talk like they knew him.

1656
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
But they didn't know Clark.

1657
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
And I can't stop them

1658
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:32,000
and look at them and tell them how proud I am of my son.

1659
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
You're the only one who knows.

1660
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Who feels what I do.

1661
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:43,000
Burdened by a secret on top of grief.

1662
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:49,000
I came all this way because I wanted...

1663
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
because I wanted to see you.

1664
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
Tell you...

1665
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
I understand.

1666
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
I...

1667
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:05,000
will never love anybody the way that I love your son.

1668
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:11,000
And I just miss him.

1669
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
I miss him so much.

1670
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
[Lois sniffles]

1671
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
So do I, sweetheart.

1672
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
[sighs]

1673
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Martha, you know if there's anything you need, I'm here.

1674
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:38,000
There is something you can do for me, honey.

1675
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:43,000
Come back to the living.

1676
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:47,000
[door opens]

1677
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
[suspenseful music plays]

1678
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:25,000
The world needs you, too, Lois.

1679
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:30,000
[Arthur]  The dead are dead.

1680
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:32,000
The box brought Victor back.

1681
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Victor wasn't dead.

1682
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Life is either one or zero.

1683
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:39,000
It's to be or not to be. Not both.

1684
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
Can you operate this box, Victor?

1685
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:42,000
[Victor] Of course.

1686
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:45,000
But we don't know enough about Kryptonian biology.

1687
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
There's no telling what's gonna happen.

1688
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:50,000
-[Diana sighs] -[Barry] Okay, but...

1689
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:55,000
I mean, we have to try. Don't we? We have to try.

1690
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:56,000
What do we have to lose?

1691
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:59,000
We cannot try unless we activate the box.

1692
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:00,000
As soon as it wakes up...

1693
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:03,000
...the enemy sees it, comes,

1694
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
activates The Unity. The end.

1695
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:08,000
So, what we have to lose is the entire planet

1696
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
to a bunch of genocidal aliens.

1697
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
That's good to know.

1698
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:13,000
Even if Superman could return,

1699
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
who's to say that he could defeat them?

1700
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
The Mother Box did.

1701
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
Victor's father activated a Mother Box

1702
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:22,000
more than a year ago when Superman was still alive.

1703
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Didn't call out to Steppenwolf.

1704
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
None of the boxes did. Not until...

1705
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
Not until Superman died.

1706
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:31,000
Not until Superman died.

1707
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
It's like they were afraid of him?

1708
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:36,000
[Bruce] Yes, they were afraid of him.

1709
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
This is the only way.

1710
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:46,000
There are six, not five. There is no us without him.

1711
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
[Barry] Cross this one off the bucket list.

1712
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Exhume Superman from the grave. Check.

1713
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:13,000
You know we could do this in a nanosecond, right?

1714
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
We could.

1715
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
He was my hero.

1716
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:28,000
All right.

1717
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:35,000
An Amazon working with an Atlantean.

1718
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Half-Atlantean.

1719
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:41,000
How many thousands of years since our people spoke?

1720
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:45,000
I don't know. I'm not exactly close to mine.

1721
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:48,000
I hate Atlanteans as much as you Amazons do.

1722
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Hate is useless.

1723
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Yep.

1724
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
No, thank you.

1725
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:03,000
You know, my father told me

1726
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
there's a saying in Atlantis...

1727
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
"None are taken back from the darkness.

1728
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:10,000
"Not without..."

1729
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
"Not without giving one up in return."

1730
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
We say the same thing.

1731
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
How about that?

1732
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Wonder Woman.

1733
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
What do you think, man?

1734
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:28,000
You think she'd ever go for a younger guy?

1735
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
She's 5,000 years old, Barry.

1736
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Every guy's a younger guy.

1737
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:37,000
[Alfred] Jesus.

1738
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
[steam hissing]

1739
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:40,000
Oh, Christ.

1740
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
-[blasting] -Oh, bloody...

1741
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Any luck?

1742
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:49,000
If by "luck" you mean

1743
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:52,000
"chance in hell we'll get it flying today,"

1744
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:55,000
then, no. No luck.

1745
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
[Bruce] It's okay.

1746
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
It doesn't matter. We're just gonna take the body

1747
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:00,000
to the Kryptonian ship.

1748
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,000
It's basically an organic computer.

1749
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
It can talk directly to the Mother Box.

1750
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:06,000
What? The way it talked to Lex Luthor?

1751
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:07,000
[Bruce] Something like that.

1752
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:11,000
[Alfred] Huh. What could possibly go wrong?

1753
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
[Alfred sighing]

1754
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:19,000
Master Wayne...

1755
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
you did it!

1756
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:26,000
You put the team together to fight this war.

1757
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:30,000
You've fulfilled your promise.

1758
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:34,000
But to try to do that... I mean...

1759
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:37,000
your guilt's overcome your reason.

1760
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
Not all the king's horses nor all the king's men...

1761
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:42,000
Alfred, for once, I'm operating strictly

1762
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:42,000
on faith,

1763
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:45,000
not on reason.

1764
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:49,000
But if you start playing with this little box of tricks,

1765
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
I mean, it could be the end of everything.

1766
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:55,000
How do you know your team's strong enough?

1767
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
If you can't bring down the charging bull,

1768
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
then don't wave the red cape at it.

1769
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
You do when it's this red cape.

1770
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
This red cape charges back.

1771
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:19,000
Okay.

1772
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
You were right, Dr. Stone. The tests came back negative.

1773
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
Everyone's clear, including you.

1774
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:33,000
Just to be on the safe side, we swept the entire facility.

1775
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
Well, thank you, Thomas. That means I'm free to go?

1776
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:36,000
Absolutely.

1777
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:41,000
-Thanks. -Listen up, everyone.

1778
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:44,000
You're all clear. So, gather your things.

1779
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:45,000
If you need more medical attention...

1780
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:49,000
Arthur, yes, your opinion. Less preposterous. Option "A"?

1781
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
-Definitely not "A." -Okay.

1782
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:54,000
Or... "B"?

1783
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:57,000
Let me see "A" again?

1784
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Right. We should get dressed.

1785
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
I'm always dressed.

1786
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:14,000

1788

ID.

1789
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:44,000
Aye, aye.

1790
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:47,000
[softly] "Aye, aye"?

[electrical whirring]

1793
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
[soldier] Okay.

1794
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
"Okay"? Oh, gee, okay!

1795
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:22,000
Doc!

1796
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:23,000
They let you out of quarantine.

1797
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
Yeah, I finally got them to listen to reason.

1798
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
Now, let's take a look and see what progress we've made

1799
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
with the electron-laser.

1800
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
We've made some real progress. Let me show you.

1801
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
[Batman grunts softly]

1802
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:49,000
Victor, clear this place out.

1803
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Done.

1804
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000

-[people murmuring] -[Ryan] Bio red five.

1809
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
The sensor's picking up a microbe of alien origin.

1810
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:08,000
A microbe of alien origin? That doesn't make any sense.

1811
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:09,000
It's gotta be a false alarm.

1812
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
All right, people, shut it down. Let's go.

1813
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:13,000
-Ryan, we just had it swept. -We have to go, Doc.

1814
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:14,000
Think about it. It's gotta be a false alarm.

1815
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:16,000
-Let's go, Doc. -Think about it.

1816

Look, wait! Wait! Shit!

1818

02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
-[man]  Go ahead, Dr. Stone. -This is a false alarm.

1827
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
Someone has hacked into the system. We must alert...

1828
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
[door opens]

1829
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
Victor.

1830
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:24,000
[man]  Dr. Stone, you there? I don't copy.

1831
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:26,000
I was mistaken.

1832
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:27,000
The alarm's legit.

1833
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
Everybody out. And nobody, I repeat,

1834
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:32,000
nobody comes back inside without my say-so.

1835
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:33,000
[man]  Roger that, sir.

1836
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
[officer 1] Get the civilians out!

1837
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:46,000
[officer 2] Let's go! Let's go!

1838
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
-Everybody got out okay? -I think so.

1839
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:53,000
-Everybody? -Yes.

1840
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
[electrical hum]

1841
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:23,000
[clears throat]

1842
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
This way.

1843
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:41,000
It knows he's here.

1844
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
[exhales heavily] Ooh, that's intense.

1845
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
This is amazing.

1846
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
This is crazy.

1847
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
Oh, what? Now it's crazy?

1848
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
You two lunatics better know what you're doing.

1849
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
[soft orchestral music playing]

1850
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:26,000
[grunts softly]

1851
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:34,000
[sighs]

1852
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
[breathes deeply]

1853
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:26,000
[switch clicks]

1854
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
[soft orchestral music continues]

1855
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
[ship AI] Systems coming online.

1856
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
[glitches]  Welcome, Victor.

1857
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
Would you like to assume command?

1858
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:32,000
I'm in.

1859
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
The ship says the Mother Box is hostile.

1860
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
I can override the security protocols,

1861
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:47,000
but there's no time to repair all the electrical damage

1862
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:49,000
that Luthor's power surges caused

1863
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:50,000
to the primary capacitors.

1864
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:51,000
English.

1865
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:54,000
There's not enough charge to wake the box.

1866
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
[inhales sharply] I might be able to do it.

1867
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
I mean, I might be able to jump-start it.

1868
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:01,000
I don't like to break this rule,

1869
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:03,000
but when I approach the speed of light, I...

1870
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
Look, crazy things happen to time,

1871
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:08,000
but if I do it, I create massive electrical power.

1872
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
I could backtrack, if I can get enough distance,

1873
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
I can conduct a significant electrical current.

1874
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:15,000
I might be able to wake the box, if that's...

1875
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
still what we want?

1876
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:18,000
It is. Do it.

1877
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:21,000
[inhales sharply]

1878
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:24,000
[officer] Hey, Miss Lane.

1879
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:25,000
Morning.

1880
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
I didn't think you were coming.

1881
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:29,000
[sighs] One last time.

1882
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
[somber orchestral music playing]

1883
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:50,000
I see engines, so this must be the end of the line. So I'm...

1884
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:51,000
[over radio]  I'm in position.

1885
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
[electrical hum]

1886
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:57,000
[ship AI]  Ready to initiate drop sequence.

1887
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:58,000
The Mother Box is ready.

1888
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
[somber orchestral music continues]

1889
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
The ship's begging me not to wake the box.

1890
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:21,000
[ship AI]  This action is irreversible.

1891
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:23,000
[Cyborg] It's afraid. It knows Steppenwolf

1892
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:23,000
will come for it.

1893
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
We know that already. Continue.

1894
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:28,000
[ship AI]  I strongly advise against activation.

1895
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:29,000
Barry, I'm initiating the countdown.

1896
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000

1900
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:36,000
No, it isn't. Keep going.

1901
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:37,000

1902
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
-[ship AI]  Four... -Four...

1903
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:40,000
[ship AI]  I strongly advise against activation.

1904
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
-We need to abort, now. -Just do it.

-Two... -This course is irreversible.

-One. -[ship AI]  One.

1910
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:51,000
One.

1911
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000

It's my auto-defense system.

[soft music playing]

2008
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
Please.

[exhales deeply]

02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:27,000
[panting]

2011
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:36,000
Please.

2012
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:43,000
[Lois breathing shakily]

2013
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
Please.

2014
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
Just go.

2015
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:53,000
Yeah.

2016
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
Let's go.

2017
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:58,000
[Clark inhales deeply]

2018
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
[distant thud]

[The Flash groaning]

02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
[breathes heavily]

2021
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:30,000
I'm so sorry.

2022
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:31,000
[whooshing]

2023
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
[indistinct shouting]

2024
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:40,000
[man] Take cover!

2025
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
-He's coming. -The Mother Box.

2026
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:44,000
Where is it?

2027
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
Come on.

2028
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
Come on.

2029
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:01,000
-[Steppenwolf grunts] -[people screaming]

2030
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000

02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
[roars angrily]

2032
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:16,000

-[electricity crackling] -[grunts]

02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:27,000
[automated voice]  Attention, security breach detected.

2036
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
Sector Four, Level Three.

2037
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:32,000
Implement lockdown procedures immediately.

2038
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
[Steppenwolf roars]

2039
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:42,000

[Steppenwolf growling]

2041
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:02,000
Give me the Mother Box.

02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:06,000
[Cyborg grunts]

2043
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
No, no, no.

2044
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
Dad, wait! Don't!

[electricity crackling]

2048
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:04,000
So begins the end.

2049
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
[portal booming]

2050
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:11,000
[The Flash] Victor?

2051
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:17,000
Vic... Whoa, Victor. Are you okay, man? Come on.

2052
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:24,000
Victor?

2053
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
He's dead.

2054
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:28,000
What?

2055
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:30,000
My father.

2056
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:35,000
I didn't save him. I couldn't.

2057
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
[The Flash] Oh, my God.

2058
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
[breathes heavily]

2059
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
His father's dead 'cause of us.

2060
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:47,000
I told you waking that box was a bad idea.

2061
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
It wasn't a bad idea.

2062
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:52,000
We needed Superman. We still do.

2063
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
[Aquaman] Well, whatever returned,

2064
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
it isn't Superman.

2065
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:57,000
His body and powers, maybe. But it ain't him.

2066
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
[Batman] It is him.

2067
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:02,000
He recognized Lois Lane.

2068
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,000
-Who? -The woman he loves.

2069
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,000
-He remembers her. -[Aquaman] Nah.

2070
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
He went to her 'cause she wasn't afraid of him.

2071
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
It's called instinct, Diana.

2072
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
[Aquaman sighs]

2073
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
[The Flash] Wait, where did Steppenwolf go?

2074
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
[Wonder Woman] He's gone back to his base

2075
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
to assemble the three boxes.

2076
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:24,000
[Aquaman] And we don't know where his base is.

2077
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
-Or how long until... -[Batman] Hours.

2078
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
The boxes synchronize, Unity forms,

2079
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:31,000
we don't get there in time to stop it, the planet dies.

2080
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
[whispers] This is not your...

2081
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
[gasps]

2082
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
He knew.

2083
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
He knew, he knew, he knew.

2084
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:40,000
He wasn't trying to destroy the box...

2085
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
he was trying to superheat it.

2086
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:44,000
He made the core the hottest thing

2087
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:45,000
on Earth outside of a nuclear reactor.

2088
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:46,000
Now, anything that hot would have to...

2089
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:48,000
[Batman] Blink off the charts

2090
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
on a thermal imaging system.

2091
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:53,000
Your father sacrificed himself to mark that box.

2092
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:56,000
We have to get back to my lab and use the satellite

2093
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
to scan the Earth for thermal anomalies.

2094
02:52:58,000 --> 02:52:59,000
I'm already on it.

2095
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
I'm sorry. [hesitates] You have a satellite?

2096
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
I have six.

2097
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:04,000
Right.

2098
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:08,000
Let's go find the son of a bitch.

2099
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:20,000
[birds chirping]

2100
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:22,000
[soft music playing]

2101
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
You brought us here.

2102
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:36,000
You remembered.

2103
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:38,000
This is home.

2104
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:41,000
You spoke.

2105
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
Did I not before?

2106
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:24,000
Your mother got behind on the payments.

2107
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
She never told anyone.

2108
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
I don't understand.

2109
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:36,000
She's a proud woman, Clark.

2110
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
Here.

2111
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:57,000
She loved it here.

2112
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:06,000
[birds chirping]

2113
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,000
So did I.

2114
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:13,000
So did I.

2115
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:20,000
[Clark sighs]

2116
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:40,000
[The Flash] Wow!

2117
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,000
This is awesome.

2118
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,000
[Bruce] Brought some friends.

2119
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:53,000
Oh, gosh, yes! Yes!

2120
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
Everyone, this is Alfred. I work for him.

2121
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:58,000
-Alfred. -Good day, ma'am.

2122
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
[Alfred] Oh...

2123
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:03,000
[Alfred clears throat]

2124
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:06,000
It's badass, Alfred.

2125
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
Well, I'll put on the tea.

2126
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:13,000
Great.

2127
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,000
I don't know where we're gonna find the cups.

2128
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:20,000
[Bruce] There's the Mother Box, right there.

2129
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:22,000
[Wonder Woman] Go to visible spectrum.

2130
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
[sighs] Pozharnov.

2131
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:29,000
Ghost city not far from Moscow.

2132
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,000
It's been abandoned since

2133
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:32,000
the nuclear accident there 30 years ago.

2134
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:34,000
Not even the army goes in.

2135
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:35,000
[Barry] Right, it's probably so radioactive

2136
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
that you grow an extra foot outta your neck.

2137
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
Not anymore.

2138
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,000
He's harvested the radiation to build his base.

2139
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:42,000
Zoom.

2140
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:43,000
[keyboard clacking]

2141
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:47,000
What the hell is he building?

2142
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
[Cyborg] The Unity's in there.

2143
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:50,000
We'll attack from above.

2144
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:53,000
Explosives won't separate the boxes,

2145
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
only strengthen their bond.

2146
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:56,000
[Barry] What? So we can't blow it up?

2147
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:58,000
[Cyborg] Not from the outside.

2148
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:02,000
I want to plug into The Unity, one-on-one.

2149
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:04,000
Fuse with it.

2150
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:05,000
Weaken its bond from the inside

2151
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
so we can break it back into three.

2152
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
No, you don't know what you'd be up against.

2153
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:13,000
You'd have to stream into The Unity by yourself.

2154
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
These boxes together are world destroyers.

2155
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
A billion years old.

2156
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
They'll get inside you and find your weaknesses

2157
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
and your fears, and use them to destroy you.

2158
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:24,000
Just get me in and get me time.

2159
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:25,000
You could die, Victor.

2160
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:28,000
If I don't, we all die. Period.

2161
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:34,000
I got nothing left.

2162
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
You wanted me to use these gifts, right?

2163
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:46,000
That's what I'm gonna do.

2164
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:48,000
[Barry] Okay. So...

2165
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,000
if Victor wants to try to save the world

2166
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:52,000
by fusing with the doom boxes,

2167
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,000
I say we put him in the doom boxes.

2168
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:57,000
But getting him in means attacking that base.

2169
02:57:57,000 --> 02:58:00,000
Fighting the devil and his army

2170
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:01,000
in hell.

2171
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
[Barry] I mean, this guy's probably fought

2172
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:06,000
hundreds of thousands of other superbeings

2173
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:08,000
on the other planets he's destroyed, right?

2174
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:09,000
And we have to assume he's won.

2175
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:11,000
I don't care how many demons he's fought

2176
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:12,000
in how many hells...

2177
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:16,000
he's never fought us. Not us united.

2178
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:18,000
[hopeful music plays]

2179
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:42,000
[soft music playing]

2180
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:08,000
Take that as a "yes."

2181
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:10,000
[Lois] What?

2182
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:14,000
The ring.

2183
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:20,000
You're really back.

2184
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:55,000
I have a second chance, Lo.

2185
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,000
And I am not gonna waste it.

2188
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:00,000
Are you really you?

2189
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:02,000
I'm really me, Ma.

2190
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:04,000
[Martha laughs]

2191
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:22,000
Listen, Ma.

2192
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:25,000
They wanted me back for a reason.

2193
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:29,000
I need to find out why.

2194
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:32,000
[Martha sighs]

2195
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:50,000
How's Victor doing?

2196
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:57,000
You know, wanted to be by himself.

2197
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:02,000
We're asking a kid who just lost his father

2198
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:04,000
to go up against the most powerful machines

2199
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:05,000
in the universe.

2200
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:08,000
It's not fair.

2201
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:12,000
I thought you didn't care?

2202
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:15,000
I never said that.

2203
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:29,000
What is it?

2204
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:33,000
Uh...

2205
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:36,000
I had a dream, like, I don't know,

2206
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:39,000
almost like a premonition.

2207
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:41,000
It was the end of the world

2208
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:44,000
and Barry Allen was right here

2209
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:49,000
and he said to me, "Lois Lane is the key."

2210
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:55,000
She is... to Superman.

2211
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:58,000
Every heart has one.

2212
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:00,000
I think it's something more.

2213
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:02,000
Something darker.

2214
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:08,000
Master Wayne.

2215
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:10,000
Master Wayne!

2216
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:12,000
You need to see this.

2217
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:17,000
[triumphant music playing]

2218
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:37,000
You fixed it.

2219
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:39,000
It wanted to fly.

2220
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:41,000
Flight is its nature.

2221
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:43,000
Yours, too.

2222
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:51,000
He'll be here, Alfred, I know it.

2223
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:54,000
What makes you so sure?

2224
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:57,000
Faith, Alfred. Faith.

2225
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:20,000
At last.

2226
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:25,000
Prepare for his arrival.

2227
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:31,000
My redemption is nigh.

2228
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:40,000
Unite.

2229
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:48,000
Synchronize.

2230
03:04:55,000 --> 03:04:57,000

[Mother Boxes pinging]

2236
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:33,000
[Bruce] The satellites revealed

2237
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:35,000
he's created a defensive dome.

2238
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:36,000
It's a design flaw.

2239
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:39,000
Take out the tower, the dome will fall.

2240
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:41,000
The enemy never anticipated a frontal assault.

2241
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:43,000
[The Flash] Right, probably 'cause he didn't think

2242
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:45,000
anyone would be that nuts.

2243
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:47,000
Bruce is right.

2244
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:49,000
We've got to destroy the defensive dome

2245
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:51,000
so we can reach The Unity before it synchronizes.

2246
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:53,000
What if the dome's not destroyed?

2247
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:54,000
It'll be destroyed.

2248
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:56,000
[Wonder Woman] Once Victor is linked with The Unity

2249
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:58,000
with Barry's help,

2250
03:05:58,000 --> 03:06:00,000
he'll break through The Unity's defenses.

2251
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:01,000
[Aquaman] Remind me, how's that again?

2252
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:03,000
Uh, with the power of love.

2253
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:06,000
-Barry. -With a catastrophic

2254
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:06,000

2255
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:07,000
Good.

2256
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:09,000
You'll have to run faster than you've ever attempted

2257
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:12,000
to generate a charge of that size.

2258
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:14,000
And then you make physical contact with Victor.

2259
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:17,000
That force should propel him inside The Unity.

2260
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:19,000
And, Victor, it's all up to you.

2261
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:23,000
Take it apart from the inside before it synchronizes.

2262
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:26,000
[The Flash] Whew. We actually finally have a plan.

2263
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:28,000
[Bruce] We have a plan.

2264
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:39,000
[soft music plays]

2265
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:45,000
[Jor-El]  The symbol of the house of El means hope.

2266
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:48,000
Embodied within that hope is the fundamental belief

2267
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:52,000
in the potential of every person to be a force for good.

2268
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:53,000
[Jonathan]  Clark...

2269
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:55,000
[Jor-El]  That's what you can bring them.

2270
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:57,000
[Jonathan]  ...you were sent here for a reason.

2271
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:58,000
[Jor-El]  You will give the people of Earth

2272
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:00,000
an ideal to strive towards.

2273
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:02,000
[Jonathan] And even if it takes you

2274
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:03,000
the rest of your life,

2275
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:07,000
you owe it to yourself to find out what that reason is.

2276
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:09,000
[Jor-El]  They will stumble, they will fall.

2277
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:12,000
[Jonathan]  You're gonna have to make a choice.

2278
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:14,000
[Jor-El]  They will join you in the sun, Kal.

2279
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:16,000
[Jonathan]  A choice of whether to stand proud

2280
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:18,000
in front of the human race or not.

2281
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:22,000
[Jor-El]  You will help them accomplish wonders.

2282
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:43,000
All the hopes and dreams of Krypton live in you now.

2283
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:47,000
[Jonathan] I'm so proud of you, son.

2284
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:50,000
[Jor-El]  Your mother and I loved you.

2285
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:51,000
[Jonathan] Your mother and I knew

2286
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:54,000
you would change the world.

2287
03:07:55,000 --> 03:07:58,000
[Jor-El]  Your heart was tested.

2288
03:07:58,000 --> 03:08:00,000
[Jonathan]  I know it's been hard, Clark.

2289
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:03,000
[Jor-El]  But you gave hope to their world.

2290
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:07,000
[Jonathan]  You need to show them who you are.

2291
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:09,000
[Jor-El]  Love them, Kal.

2292
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:12,000
The way we loved you.

2298
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:22,000
I'm gonna take out that tower

2299
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:24,000
and knock down that shield dome.

2301

stick to the plan.

[Alfred] Must be.

2551
03:36:44,000 --> 03:36:46,000
Big round table.

2552
03:36:46,000 --> 03:36:48,000
Six chairs, right there.

2553
03:36:49,000 --> 03:36:51,000
But room for more.

2554
03:36:53,000 --> 03:36:55,000
But room for more.

2555
03:36:56,000 --> 03:36:58,000
God help us.

2556
03:36:58,000 --> 03:36:59,000
[pigeons cooing]

2557
03:36:59,000 --> 03:37:02,000
[Silas]  The now is you.

2558
03:37:03,000 --> 03:37:04,000
[slams]

2559
03:37:05,000 --> 03:37:07,000
What?

2560
03:37:07,000 --> 03:37:10,000
It's actually the worst job you can get in a crime lab.

2561
03:37:10,000 --> 03:37:12,000
But, uh, my foot's in the door.

2562
03:37:12,000 --> 03:37:14,000
This is like a "job" job?

2563
03:37:15,000 --> 03:37:16,000
"Job" job.

2564
03:37:19,000 --> 03:37:22,000
[laughs] Your foot's in the door.

2565
03:37:24,000 --> 03:37:25,000
Isn't that a thing people say?

2566
03:37:26,000 --> 03:37:27,000
Your foot's in the door.

2567
03:37:28,000 --> 03:37:30,000
Yeah, that's something people say, man.

2568
03:37:30,000 --> 03:37:32,000
-His foot's in the door! -[prisoners cheering]

2569
03:37:32,000 --> 03:37:34,000
-That's my boy, right there! -Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.

2570
03:37:35,000 --> 03:37:36,000
Taught him nothing he knows.

2571
03:37:36,000 --> 03:37:37,000
-[Henry] Yes! [laughs] -Dad, you're gonna

2572
03:37:37,000 --> 03:37:38,000
get maced again.

2573
03:37:42,000 --> 03:37:43,000
No stopping you now.

2574
03:37:44,000 --> 03:37:45,000
[Barry chuckles softly]

2575
03:37:45,000 --> 03:37:47,000
Thanks, Dad.

2576
03:37:47,000 --> 03:37:48,000
[Silas]  Now.

2577
03:37:48,000 --> 03:37:51,000
Now's your time, Victor, to rise.

2578
03:37:51,000 --> 03:37:54,000
"Thank you" is not enough for what you did.

2579
03:37:54,000 --> 03:37:58,000
I just undid a mistake, that's all.

2580
03:38:00,000 --> 03:38:01,000
[Clark chuckles]

2581
03:38:08,000 --> 03:38:11,000
How did you get the house back from the bank?

2582
03:38:11,000 --> 03:38:13,000
I bought the bank.

2583
03:38:16,000 --> 03:38:18,000
Congratulations, by the way.

2584
03:38:18,000 --> 03:38:20,000
[Silas]  Do this. Be this.

2585
03:38:20,000 --> 03:38:25,000
The man I never was. The hero you are.

2586
03:38:25,000 --> 03:38:28,000
Take your place among the brave ones.

2587
03:38:28,000 --> 03:38:33,000
The ones that were, that are, that are yet to be.

2588
03:38:33,000 --> 03:38:35,000
[engine revving]

2589
03:38:39,000 --> 03:38:40,000
[clangs]

2590
03:39:06,000 --> 03:39:09,000
It's time you stand,

2591
03:39:12,000 --> 03:39:14,000
fight,

2592
03:39:16,000 --> 03:39:18,000
discover,

2593
03:39:23,000 --> 03:39:25,000
heal, love,

2594
03:39:28,000 --> 03:39:29,000
win.

2595
03:39:56,000 --> 03:39:58,000
The time

2596
03:39:58,000 --> 03:39:59,000
is now.

2597
03:40:03,000 --> 03:40:05,000
[doors buzzing]

2598
03:40:08,000 --> 03:40:10,000
[prison guard] Ready?

2599
03:40:10,000 --> 03:40:11,000
Come on, Stevens.

2600
03:40:11,000 --> 03:40:13,000
[prisoner chattering indistinctly]

2601
03:40:13,000 --> 03:40:15,000
[prisoner 2 hyperventilating]

2602
03:40:15,000 --> 03:40:16,000
[prison guard] All right, let's keep it moving.

2603
03:40:18,000 --> 03:40:19,000
Keep going.

2604
03:40:21,000 --> 03:40:23,000
[prison guard 2] Come on, Luthor. Let's go.

2605
03:40:26,000 --> 03:40:28,000
Luthor.

2606
03:40:32,000 --> 03:40:34,000
Open up two, Carl, please.

2607
03:40:43,000 --> 03:40:44,000
Luthor.

2608
03:40:49,000 --> 03:40:50,000
All right, stop jerking around, Luthor,

2609
03:40:50,000 --> 03:40:52,000
or I'm gonna have to come in there.

2610
03:41:10,000 --> 03:41:12,000
[laughs maniacally, growls]

2611
03:41:12,000 --> 03:41:15,000
-[continues laughing] -[prison guard gasps]

2612
03:41:27,000 --> 03:41:29,000
[alarm wailing]

2613
03:41:30,000 --> 03:41:33,000
[prison guards shouting indistinctly]

2614
03:42:21,000 --> 03:42:23,000
Ah, there he is.

2615
03:42:23,000 --> 03:42:25,000
Welcome aboard.

2616
03:42:25,000 --> 03:42:27,000
Care for a glass of Gout de Diamants?

2617
03:42:27,000 --> 03:42:29,000
I was just celebrating God's return.

2618
03:42:29,000 --> 03:42:31,000
Out of the ground and back up into the sky.

2619
03:42:31,000 --> 03:42:34,000
[Deathstroke] I heard you were a few clowns

2620
03:42:31,000 --> 03:42:34,000
short of a circus.

2621
03:42:34,000 --> 03:42:36,000
[chuckles] I was, thank you,

2622
03:42:36,000 --> 03:42:38,000
until the good doctors at Arkham helped me

2623
03:42:38,000 --> 03:42:40,000
find some much needed clarity.

2624
03:42:40,000 --> 03:42:42,000
Now, you volunteered to destroy the bat

2625
03:42:43,000 --> 03:42:44,000
free of charge.

2626
03:42:44,000 --> 03:42:45,000
Why the pro bono work?

2627
03:42:46,000 --> 03:42:48,000
[sighs] It's personal.

2628
03:42:48,000 --> 03:42:51,000
Ah, let me guess, an eye for an eye?

2629
03:42:52,000 --> 03:42:54,000
You said you had something I'd want?

2630
03:42:54,000 --> 03:42:56,000
You'd better not be wasting my time.

2631
03:42:56,000 --> 03:42:58,000
Ooh. And endure your wrath, Mr. Wilson?

2632
03:42:58,000 --> 03:43:00,000
No, I wouldn't think of it.

2633
03:43:00,000 --> 03:43:01,000
Uh, I have too much to live for.

2634
03:43:01,000 --> 03:43:05,000
And more important things to do.

2635
03:43:05,000 --> 03:43:08,000
But if you want the Batman,

2636
03:43:08,000 --> 03:43:12,000
here is something that can help you.

2637
03:43:13,000 --> 03:43:17,000
His name is Bruce Wayne.

2638
03:43:20,000 --> 03:43:23,000
Hmm. On second thought,

2639
03:43:25,000 --> 03:43:27,000
we do have something to celebrate.

2640
03:43:28,000 --> 03:43:29,000
Good boy.

2641
03:43:52,000 --> 03:43:54,000
[parademon chitters]

2642
03:44:34,000 --> 03:44:35,000
Clear.

2643
03:44:40,000 --> 03:44:42,000
How much further?

2644
03:44:43,000 --> 03:44:44,000
We're almost there.

2645
03:44:47,000 --> 03:44:48,000
Well, we need to hurry.

2646
03:44:48,000 --> 03:44:50,000
We can't be out in the open much longer.

2647
03:44:50,000 --> 03:44:52,000
He'll come for us.

2648
03:44:54,000 --> 03:44:57,000
[Mera] Let him come.

2649
03:44:57,000 --> 03:44:58,000
Let the bastard come.

2650
03:45:00,000 --> 03:45:02,000
I'll stab this through his heart

2651
03:45:02,000 --> 03:45:04,000
for what he did to Arthur.

2652
03:45:04,000 --> 03:45:06,000
I want to make him pay.

2653
03:45:08,000 --> 03:45:11,000
I understand how you feel, Mera.

2654
03:45:11,000 --> 03:45:14,000
You have no idea how I feel.

2655
03:45:14,000 --> 03:45:16,000
But we have to stick to the plan

2656
03:45:16,000 --> 03:45:18,000
to have any chance to make this right.

2657
03:45:18,000 --> 03:45:20,000
[Mera scoffs]

2658
03:45:26,000 --> 03:45:29,000
Who have you ever loved?

2659
03:45:33,000 --> 03:45:36,000
[man cackling]

2660
03:45:43,000 --> 03:45:47,000
[man]  Au contraire, my little fish stick.

2661
03:45:50,000 --> 03:45:52,000
He knows exactly what it's like

2662
03:45:52,000 --> 03:45:54,000
to lose someone he loves.

2663
03:45:56,000 --> 03:45:58,000
You know, like, uh,

2664
03:45:59,000 --> 03:46:01,000
a father,

2665
03:46:02,000 --> 03:46:04,000
like a mother.

2666
03:46:04,000 --> 03:46:08,000
Be very careful with the next thing you say.

2667
03:46:09,000 --> 03:46:11,000
Like an adopted son.

2668
03:46:15,000 --> 03:46:17,000
Isn't that right,

2669
03:46:18,000 --> 03:46:20,000
Batman?

2670
03:46:23,000 --> 03:46:24,000
Maybe, in a way,

2671
03:46:24,000 --> 03:46:26,000
that smelly old flounder is right.

2672
03:46:28,000 --> 03:46:30,000
Because how many can die in your arms

2673
03:46:31,000 --> 03:46:32,000
before you grow numb to death?

2674
03:46:34,000 --> 03:46:37,000
That's not very careful.

2675
03:46:37,000 --> 03:46:40,000
And how many dead eyes can you look into

2676
03:46:41,000 --> 03:46:43,000
before you die inside yourself?

2677
03:46:43,000 --> 03:46:47,000
I've been dead inside a long time,

2678
03:46:47,000 --> 03:46:49,000
but even I have a limit.

2679
03:46:49,000 --> 03:46:51,000
And if you cross that line, I swear to God, I will...

2680
03:46:51,000 --> 03:46:54,000
Before what, Bruce? Kill me?

2681
03:46:54,000 --> 03:46:56,000
You won't kill me.

2682
03:46:57,000 --> 03:46:59,000
I'm your best friend.

2683
03:46:59,000 --> 03:47:04,000
Besides, who's gonna give you a reach-around? [chuckles]

2684
03:47:06,000 --> 03:47:07,000
Anyway,

2685
03:47:08,000 --> 03:47:10,000
you need me.

2686
03:47:11,000 --> 03:47:13,000
You

2687
03:47:13,000 --> 03:47:16,000
need me to help you undo this world

2688
03:47:16,000 --> 03:47:19,000
you created by letting her die.

2689
03:47:21,000 --> 03:47:23,000
Poor Lois.

2690
03:47:23,000 --> 03:47:26,000
How she suffered so!

2691
03:47:27,000 --> 03:47:28,000
[sighs]

2692
03:47:32,000 --> 03:47:34,000
I often wonder

2693
03:47:34,000 --> 03:47:36,000
how many alternate timelines

2694
03:47:36,000 --> 03:47:38,000
do you destroy the world because...

2695
03:47:39,000 --> 03:47:41,000
frankly, you don't have

2696
03:47:41,000 --> 03:47:44,000
the cojones to die yourself.

2697
03:47:45,000 --> 03:47:46,000
Hmm?

2698
03:47:48,000 --> 03:47:49,000
So, as usual,

2699
03:47:50,000 --> 03:47:52,000
I'll be the bigger man.

2700
03:47:53,000 --> 03:47:55,000
[blows air]

2701
03:47:56,000 --> 03:47:57,000
A truce,

2702
03:47:58,000 --> 03:48:00,000
Bruce.

2703
03:48:00,000 --> 03:48:02,000
[cackling]

2704
03:48:02,000 --> 03:48:06,000
As long as you have this card, a truce.

2705
03:48:09,000 --> 03:48:10,000
But all you have to do

2706
03:48:10,000 --> 03:48:12,000
is tear it in half

2707
03:48:12,000 --> 03:48:13,000
and I'm happy to discuss with you

2708
03:48:13,000 --> 03:48:16,000
in any way you like, why you sent the Boy Wonder

2709
03:48:17,000 --> 03:48:19,000
to do a man's job?

2710
03:48:23,000 --> 03:48:25,000
You know, it's funny

2711
03:48:25,000 --> 03:48:26,000
that you would talk about people

2712
03:48:26,000 --> 03:48:28,000
who died in my arms

2713
03:48:28,000 --> 03:48:30,000
because when I held Harley Quinn

2714
03:48:30,000 --> 03:48:32,000
and she was bleeding and dying,

2715
03:48:32,000 --> 03:48:36,000
she begged me with her last breath

2716
03:48:36,000 --> 03:48:38,000
that when I killed you,

2717
03:48:38,000 --> 03:48:42,000
and make no mistake, I will fucking kill you...

2718
03:48:42,000 --> 03:48:44,000
that I'd do it slow.

2719
03:48:45,000 --> 03:48:47,000
I'm gonna honor that promise.

2720
03:49:18,000 --> 03:49:21,000
Oh. You're good.

2721
03:49:25,000 --> 03:49:27,000
You almost had me.

2722
03:49:33,000 --> 03:49:35,000
[cackling]

2723
03:49:41,000 --> 03:49:43,000
[Joker continues cackling]

2724
03:49:46,000 --> 03:49:47,000
Where are we holing up?

2725
03:49:47,000 --> 03:49:50,000
Somewhere he'll never suspect.

2726
03:49:50,000 --> 03:49:53,000
Still think it was a good idea bringing him along?

2727
03:49:53,000 --> 03:49:56,000
-[Joker blows raspberry] -what do you think?

2728
03:49:58,000 --> 03:49:59,000
[armor beeps]

2729
03:49:59,000 --> 03:50:01,000
[distant explosion]

2730
03:50:01,000 --> 03:50:03,000
He's found us.

[distant explosions]

2735
03:51:32,000 --> 03:51:34,000
Can I help you?

2736
03:51:34,000 --> 03:51:38,000
I'm sure you know Darkseid is not finished with Earth.

2737
03:51:38,000 --> 03:51:41,000
The Anti-Life Equation is here somewhere.

2738
03:51:41,000 --> 03:51:44,000
We have to find it before he does.

2739
03:51:44,000 --> 03:51:46,000
There's a war coming.

2740
03:51:46,000 --> 03:51:48,000
And I'm here to help.

2741
03:51:48,000 --> 03:51:51,000
I'm sorry, who are you again?

2742
03:51:51,000 --> 03:51:53,000
I've gone by many names

2743
03:51:53,000 --> 03:51:56,000
and taken many forms. And like you,

2744
03:51:56,000 --> 03:51:59,000
I've realized I have a stake in this world

2745
03:51:59,000 --> 03:52:02,000
and it's time I started fighting for it.

2746
03:52:02,000 --> 03:52:04,000
Oh.

2747
03:52:05,000 --> 03:52:07,000
Well, we could definitely use the help.

2748
03:52:07,000 --> 03:52:11,000
So, glad you're here.

2749
03:52:12,000 --> 03:52:13,000
You know, I never thought

2750
03:52:13,000 --> 03:52:14,000
I'd see the defenders of Earth

2751
03:52:14,000 --> 03:52:17,000
united and fighting as one.

2752
03:52:17,000 --> 03:52:20,000
It wouldn't have happened without you, Bruce.

2753
03:52:21,000 --> 03:52:24,000
Your mother and father would be proud.

2754
03:52:25,000 --> 03:52:26,000
I hope so.

2755
03:52:32,000 --> 03:52:35,000
Well, I'll be in touch.

2756
03:52:36,000 --> 03:52:40,000
Oh, and some have called me

2757
03:52:40,000 --> 03:52:43,000
