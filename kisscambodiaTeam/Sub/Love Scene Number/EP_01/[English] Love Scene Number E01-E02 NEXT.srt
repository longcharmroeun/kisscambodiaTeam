1
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,320
Do you believe that a
perfect relationship exists?

2
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,150
To me, relationships are
all about "take and give."

3
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,159
We all have merits of our own,

4
00:00:24,159 --> 00:00:26,929
but that also means
we all have flaws.

5
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:30,159
It's naive to believe that one
can fulfill your every need.

6
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:31,959
I'm not one to ask for much.

7
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:34,830
I only wish for what that
certain person can offer.

8
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,240
That's right.

9
00:00:37,569 --> 00:00:41,910
I'm currently in a
relationship with three guys.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,810
Easy and fun to be around.

11
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,179
It's almost as if
he looks up to me.

12
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:52,480
He's the younger
guy, aka Pocket Boy.

13
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,959
Intellectual and mature.

14
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,889
He understands my situation
regardless of what that is.

15
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:04,359
The mature boyfriend.

16
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:11,369
Last but not least...

17
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,270
is the sexy man who knows...

18
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:17,280
what women want.

19
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,380
That makes three.

20
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,410
You may be getting your
entire fill by receiving...

21
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,250
what all three
men have to offer,

22
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,720
but the three men are left to
share you among themselves.

23
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,319
How's that fair?

24
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:33,030
It was always the guys
who came up to me first.

25
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,759
- Then...
- You're...

26
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:35,959
Now...

27
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,830
- My girlfriend.
- My girlfriend.

28
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:41,229
We're each giving each other
what the other person needs,

29
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,970
so I don't see an issue.

30
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,970
Do the men know
that others exist?

31
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:51,080
The fact that they don't
know makes this perfect.

32
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:57,949
LOVE SCENE NUMBER

33
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,410
What the...

34
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,850
Why are you always here
instead of at your own place?

35
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,280
Well, because your
place is cleaner.

36
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:32,150
And better stocked.

37
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,060
Still, you should've told me
that you were coming over.

38
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:39,389
As if it's anything new.

39
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:42,859
- Aussie cheese fries?
- Double the bacon.

40
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:51,500
- Nice!
- Stop.

41
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,410
Humans are supposed
to use tools.

42
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,680
Gimbap. That's what I'm craving.

43
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:06,180
Are you kidding me?

44
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,220
Not the kind you buy, but
the kind you make at home.

45
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,620
The homemade gimbap
by Do Han Wool.

46
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,859
They're better than drugs.

47
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,060
Gimbap.

48
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,530
Gimbap by Do Han Wool.

49
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:19,359
Forget it.

50
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,829
Gimbap...

51
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,419
What? Why are you
throwing a fit?

52
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:43,560
- Give me this.
- Not that one.

53
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,160
- I want it!
- It's a limited edition.

54
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,489
It wasn't easy for
me to get that.

55
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:50,530
Choose from the
others I have, okay?

56
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,759
Like what?

57
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:54,000
How about I take
Buk-boogie instead?

58
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:56,299
What? Of course, you can't.

59
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,569
No can do then.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,539
I'll...

61
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:02,239
just have to steal it.

62
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:05,380
Hey. Wait. Nam Du Ah!

63
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,419
Sorry.

64
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:15,919
Right.

65
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,160
I'll get going then.

66
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,210
Then there's the fourth guy.

67
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:39,439
My friend, Do Han Wool.

68
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,720
DA HAM

69
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,530
I bet you miss me.
You can come over.

70
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,559
Right now, of course.

71
00:05:01,499 --> 00:05:04,140
My mom and dad?
They went on a trip.

72
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,539
Just know that I
won't wait long.

73
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,499
Wash your hands first.

74
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,749
Du Ah, how about some
éclairs for breakfast?

75
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,419
It's 10am! Didn't you
say you had a class?

76
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:00,789
What? Darn, I'll be late.

77
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:02,960
Your clothes. Don't
forget your clothes!

78
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:11,140
I've never seen these before.

79
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,410
- They're éclairs.
- Nice.

80
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,280
Is it good?

81
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,710
Nothing is better for
breakfast than sweet desserts.

82
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,379
Wait. That reminds me.

83
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,390
I brought the books.

84
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,150
Here.

85
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,289
Gosh. Thank you, Du Ah.
I'll make good use of them.

86
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:36,460
I've written a lot
in those though.

87
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:39,530
These aren't just
ordinary books.

88
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:41,669
I asked for these so that
some of your energy...

89
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:43,640
will rub off me and help
me get a good score.

90
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,239
If that's the case, I'll give
you some of my other books too.

91
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,369
Did you know...

92
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,479
that we only get to experience
a limited amount of joy in life?

93
00:06:52,609 --> 00:06:56,109
I wonder if I should be
getting my fill just with you.

94
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,720
He never seems to say the
same flirtatious line twice.

95
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,760
Crafty and creative. Nice.

96
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,660
Du Ah, are you free?

97
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,030
What is it, sir?

98
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:17,739
This. Would you like
to join my team?

99
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,369
"Society of Clinical
Psychology Symposium".

100
00:07:21,369 --> 00:07:23,879
Yes, but it's not
just any symposium...

101
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,580
I'll take this.

102
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,950
No, I meant we should
participate together. Du Ah.

103
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:30,450
I want to take the
professor's class,

104
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,520
but I don't know what to do...

105
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,289
since I'm only in
my second year.

106
00:07:33,989 --> 00:07:35,419
If you didn't take
developmental psychology,

107
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,489
you won't be able to take it.

108
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,289
The professor asks each student
when you took that class.

109
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:43,299
It may be difficult to take it.

110
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,900
I took that class last year.

111
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,369
Really?

112
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:51,239
The professor's teaching
style and the exams...

113
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,100
are very similar to that class.

114
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,809
They're very...

115
00:08:01,609 --> 00:08:02,780
soft.

116
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,280
What?

117
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:05,520
What?

118
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,390
Well, yes.

119
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,600
DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY
TEACHING ASSISTANT'S OFFICE

120
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,320
I want to write a
dissertation about polyamory.

121
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:45,859
- What?
- For the symposium.

122
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,029
I'm almost done with
the dissertation plan.

123
00:08:50,859 --> 00:08:52,659
By polyamory, do you mean...

124
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:55,629
The practice of being in
multiple open relationships.

125
00:08:56,529 --> 00:09:00,340
You don't restrict your partner
from having multiple relationships.

126
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:04,810
A type of relationship where
you maintain relationships...

127
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,180
with several partners?

128
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:09,950
You mean...

129
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,779
That's right.

130
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,050
A close friend of
yours, a writer,

131
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,450
wrote about it.

132
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:18,989
An increasing number of
people around the world...

133
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,659
are choosing not to get married.

134
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,330
That just proves that
there are flaws...

135
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,629
in the current marriage system.

136
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,529
Times have changed, and that
means people will change as well.

137
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:33,170
This is the perfect
time to research this.

138
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:36,779
So?

139
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,779
Please introduce me to her.

140
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:41,979
I want to interview her.

141
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,149
"LOVE WITHOUT OWNERSHIP"

142
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:53,690
I came here to interview you.

143
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,290
Sure. You can do that.

144
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,899
But first, let me ask
you a few questions.

145
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,999
Ask me?

146
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:04,840
Why did I... No. Why did my
book catch your attention?

147
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,070
I'd like to know that first.

148
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,739
What are you curious about?

149
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,509
After reading my book, this is what
people are the most curious about.

150
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:14,680
"Why did they become
polyamorists?"

151
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,649
"How did they date..."

152
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,779
"multiple people at a time
and even get married?"

153
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:21,019
That's what they're
curious about.

154
00:10:21,749 --> 00:10:23,790
But you can't explain it.

155
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,519
Of course not. This is
just an inclination.

156
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,460
It's the same thing as asking
why a guy likes a woman.

157
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,670
Exactly.

158
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,129
It's an inclination.
You're just born with it.

159
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,239
But how they began...

160
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:43,009
and their method of doing it...

161
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,609
are different.

162
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,979
What about you?

163
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:50,550
Me?

164
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:54,619
You're not in an ordinary
relationship, are you?

165
00:10:54,619 --> 00:10:55,690
How is it?

166
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:02,790
You're not going to show this
video to anyone else, are you?

167
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,759
If you're worried,
should I turn this off?

168
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:08,499
Once I'm done, you'll
do the same, right?

169
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:10,369
- Of course.
- Then it's fine.

170
00:11:12,869 --> 00:11:17,509
I'm in a perfect relationship.

171
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,409
I beg to differ.

172
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:24,180
Before deciding what kind of
relationship is the most ideal,

173
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,820
you should determine
the sincerity...

174
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,989
Coming. I'm coming.

175
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:38,300
Okay, I'm coming.

176
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,629
This is you, right?
It's you, isn't it?

177
00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:42,899
What is this?

178
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,440
This was posted on our
school's online community.

179
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,609
This is your house.

180
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,749
"I'm Exposing the
Double Life..."

181
00:11:53,749 --> 00:11:56,810
"of an Extremely Intelligent Student
from Social Science Class of 2017."

182
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,350
"From the outside, she looks
like a perfect, golden child."

183
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,519
"But the truth is, she's
in a messy relationship..."

184
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,420
"with three guys..."

185
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,060
"and is deceiving them."

186
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:11,659
This should be taken seriously.

187
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,700
Someone who came to your
house took this photo...

188
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,300
and spread such a
ridiculous rumour about you.

189
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,940
"A week from now, on
the 19th at noon,"

190
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,779
"I'll reveal her identity."

191
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:25,840
Then there's only six days left.

192
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,149
Let's tell the administrators
to delete this post immediately.

193
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:29,609
What are you talking about?

194
00:12:29,609 --> 00:12:31,220
Do you want everyone
to know that it's me?

195
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,019
I can ask them.

196
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,350
Or it could be anonymous.

197
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,389
No.

198
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:38,119
It's useless to ask them
to delete it right now.

199
00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:39,389
Then you'll let this be?

200
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:43,060
It's very unlikely that anyone
will know that this is me.

201
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,129
Deleting this post
immediately...

202
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:46,859
will only provoke
this individual.

203
00:12:46,859 --> 00:12:48,670
By the way, why are
you so nonchalant?

204
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,300
Do you know who took this?

205
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,340
- Perhaps.
- Who is it?

206
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,710
I'll take care of
this. You can go home.

207
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,139
Don't be absurd.

208
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,149
What will you do on your own?

209
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,420
Then what can you do?

210
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,920
I'm the one who found that post.

211
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,720
I'm not leaving until
you explain it to me.

212
00:13:09,249 --> 00:13:10,259
Hey.

213
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,170
These are the suspects who
could've taken this photo.

214
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,570
There are three in total.

215
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,680
It steadily grows...

216
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,379
Yeon Sang Woo, a senior of
mine and a graduate student.

217
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,909
Han Si Han, an engineering
student, class of 2018.

218
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,050
Yoo Da Ham, a fourth-year
student from K University.

219
00:13:40,249 --> 00:13:43,519
- They've been here at least once.
- Stop it.

220
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,359
So that post is true?

221
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,229
You were dating
three guys at once?

222
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:55,930
- So what?
- How could you be so fearless...

223
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,600
as to bring a guy home
when you're living alone?

224
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,139
Hey, you're a guy too.
And you're here with me.

225
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,779
Are you comparing me with them?

226
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,509
What's so different about you?

227
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,550
Han Wool,

228
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,590
I don't understand why you're
reacting this way. It baffles me.

229
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,119
There are consequences.

230
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,359
Don't you see the consequences?

231
00:14:24,859 --> 00:14:26,359
It all happened because...

232
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:29,700
Are you saying it's
because I was careless?

233
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,869
No. That's not what I meant.

234
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:34,609
Whatever.

235
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,040
I can take care of it.
You really should go home.

236
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,149
Du Ah.

237
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,889
What's your relationship
with those three anyway?

238
00:14:56,259 --> 00:14:58,200
I said, I can take care of it.

239
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:01,670
I'll find out why he did this...

240
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,340
and what he wants first.
Then I can stop him.

241
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,540
I don't care.

242
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,070
Just end your relationship
with all of them right now.

243
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,540
Then he'll reveal who
I am right away...

244
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,139
without waiting for a week.

245
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:15,550
Like I said, he wants me to
recognize myself in the picture.

246
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,680
He wants to see how I'll react.

247
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,979
If I end my relationship
with all three of them...

248
00:15:19,979 --> 00:15:22,090
without even knowing
who posted it,

249
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,119
he'll do something
even more provoking...

250
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:26,590
to corner me.

251
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,859
Go home. It's late.

252
00:15:31,859 --> 00:15:34,070
I have to get up early tomorrow.

253
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:51,479
Tell me if you need anything.

254
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:53,550
I'll help you.

255
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:01,560
Okay. I will.

256
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:32,119
A perfect relationship. A
perfect relationship, my foot.

257
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,659
I've been completely fooled.

258
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:43,029
What do I do?

259
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:48,810
Who is it? Who did it?

260
00:16:50,369 --> 00:16:51,580
It's one of the three.

261
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:55,149
Think. Think, Du Ah.

262
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,450
I can find him. There are only
a limited number of suspects.

263
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,389
Who's the most likely?

264
00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:04,489
By analysing, I can find him.

265
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:06,060
It's one of the three.

266
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,590
Among the three,

267
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:10,260
suspect number one
is Yeon Sang Woo.

268
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:25,340
Are you okay? Why are you
crying? Are you not feeling well?

269
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,520
What's wrong?

270
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:44,230
He fell in love with me
the moment he saw me.

271
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:48,770
He's an open-minded grown man
who can accept whatever I say...

272
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:51,270
without prejudice.

273
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,939
He's been at my place twice.

274
00:17:55,209 --> 00:17:57,939
That means he's had two
chances to take the picture.

275
00:17:57,939 --> 00:17:59,439
Can you get my cardigan
from the kitchen?

276
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:00,750
Yes, sure.

277
00:18:02,609 --> 00:18:05,480
I'd say he's had more
than enough chances.

278
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,679
Next,

279
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,219
suspect number
two is Han Si Han.

280
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:15,290
Hey, Du Ah.

281
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,830
Yes?

282
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,060
There's something
I want to show you.

283
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,600
Okay. What is it?

284
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:27,439
This is an app I developed.

285
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:29,369
Your name, Du Ah, means love.

286
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:32,879
Whenever anyone in the world
searches for a word that means love,

287
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,350
a heart will pop up.

288
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,719
Do you mean that's
how you feel about me?

289
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,330
He's an innocent, younger guy...

290
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,260
who told me he'd had a
crush on me for two years...

291
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,060
since he entered university.

292
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,000
He's been at my place once.

293
00:18:57,899 --> 00:19:01,340
That means he's had only one
chance to take the picture.

294
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:05,740
But if he really wanted to, it
wouldn't have been impossible.

295
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,209
The last suspect, Yoo Da Ham,

296
00:19:10,209 --> 00:19:12,179
is the only one who
doesn't go to my school.

297
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,580
From the moment we first met,

298
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,919
we were strongly
attracted to each other.

299
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:51,719
He's an immensely sexy man.

300
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,859
He's been at my place...

301
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,699
a lot of times. Countless
times, actually.

302
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:04,639
Therefore, he's had
the most chances...

303
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,040
to take the picture as well.

304
00:20:13,939 --> 00:20:15,379
People behave...

305
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:18,080
more morally in the morning
than in the afternoon.

306
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,919
It's called the morning
morality effect.

307
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,520
That means I have a higher chance
to catch his lie in the morning.

308
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,760
What's up? What are you
doing at my school so early?

309
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,560
Actually, there's been a bit of
an incident at my school lately.

310
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:34,570
A freshman girl broke
up with her boyfriend,

311
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,129
and he spread her
personal pictures...

312
00:20:37,129 --> 00:20:39,340
all over social media.

313
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,510
In the end, the cops
showed up and everything.

314
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,209
- The cops?
- Yes.

315
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:45,280
Apparently, the
girl made a report.

316
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,980
The guy should have just accepted
the breakup and dealt with it.

317
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,679
The thing is, she turned out
to have been two-timing him.

318
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:54,449
That's not an excuse.

319
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:56,290
What she did is wrong,

320
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,060
but he shouldn't have
reacted that way.

321
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,560
Has that been troubling you?

322
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:03,459
Yes.

323
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:06,730
I'll see you soon.

324
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,929
See you.

325
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,770
Da Ham.

326
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:13,699
Yes?

327
00:21:14,209 --> 00:21:15,740
Do you want to come over later?

328
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,649
Wait!

329
00:21:25,219 --> 00:21:26,780
Gosh, I'm sorry.

330
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,750
- I shouldn't drink alcohol.
- What?

331
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,320
I'll lose muscle mass.

332
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,719
This is my mom's
favourite bottle.

333
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,419
You haven't had any alcohol
in a while, so it'll be fine.

334
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:08,530
- Cheers.
- Okay.

335
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,790
Let's do a love shot.

336
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:13,129
- Bottoms up.
- The entire glass?

337
00:22:13,129 --> 00:22:14,169
Yes.

338
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,040
Gosh, you're amazing.

339
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,840
Incredible.

340
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:50,570
What is this?

341
00:22:55,369 --> 00:22:57,209
October 12, Monday.

342
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,709
- This is my house.
- Morning body check.

343
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,949
Hi, Da Ham.

344
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:03,010
I love you.

345
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,550
Who is it?

346
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,449
Gosh, why is he...

347
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,199
What are you doing here?

348
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,330
Someone's in there, right?

349
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,800
I said I'd take care of it.

350
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,540
Is he one of those three guys?

351
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,740
I should find out who it is.

352
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,540
Is that important right now?

353
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,040
If he's the one who posted that,

354
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:36,449
you could be in
danger right now.

355
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:40,219
- Hey.
- He's a neighbour.

356
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:46,659
He's a neighbour
from downstairs.

357
00:23:46,889 --> 00:23:48,659
I think we were a bit loud.

358
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,369
We were loud?

359
00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:03,310
I'm sorry for causing a
ruckus at such a late hour.

360
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,010
I should go home.

361
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,709
- I'll call you. Goodnight.
- Okay.

362
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,419
Bye.

363
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,369
What do you think will
happen if you get involved?

364
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:39,580
That'll be even more dangerous
since you'll be provoking him.

365
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,080
Why aren't you asking
them right away?

366
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:46,080
I told you.

367
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,990
They wouldn't confess that way.

368
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,260
Are you sure it's not because
you don't want to admit...

369
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,119
that you were betrayed by
those guys you looked down on?

370
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,790
What do you know about
me to say such things?

371
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,929
Do you know...

372
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:01,830
what I'm thinking?

373
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,669
You're right.

374
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,109
What do I know?

375
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,409
Don't skip your meals.

376
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,550
Okay.

377
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,080
Come to the elevator right now.

378
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,740
A plaid shirt?

379
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:58,080
Du Ah.

380
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,379
Hi.

381
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,219
What brings you to my house?

382
00:27:07,389 --> 00:27:09,159
I've always wanted to visit.

383
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:10,929
Here you go.

384
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:13,530
Du Ah...

385
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:17,070
Goodness, I forgot
to buy beverages.

386
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:20,899
I'm totally parched. Could
you buy me some beverages?

387
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,270
Okay.

388
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,639
- Right now.
- Okay. I won't take long.

389
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:25,740
Okay.

390
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,040
It's not in the gallery.

391
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,709
"DA"?

392
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,050
"Du Ah"?

393
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,879
Is it me?

394
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:08,290
What?

395
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:12,560
Why did he screenshot all my
photos from my social media?

396
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,429
Right, the plaid shirt.

397
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:17,859
The plaid shirt...

398
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:30,310
No, these are different.

399
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:32,980
These aren't it.

400
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,619
What the...

401
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,689
LOVELY SI HAN, I
MISS YOU SO MUCH.

402
00:28:47,689 --> 00:28:48,830
A Ra?

403
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,869
SI HAN, I HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

404
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,100
Ji Min?

405
00:28:57,969 --> 00:28:59,070
SI HAN, IT'S THE
BELT YOU WANTED!

406
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,070
Su Jin?

407
00:29:05,939 --> 00:29:07,280
Are these all...

408
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:10,209
Gosh.

409
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:15,320
I got us some beverages.

410
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,619
What did you get?

411
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,959
Actually, these should
be set to the side.

412
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,639
Don't. Don't!

413
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,510
I'm not interested in
doing this with you.

414
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,320
Du Ah, I'm sorry.

415
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,020
I must've been insane just now.

416
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,990
This isn't who I am.

417
00:29:51,219 --> 00:29:52,719
I hope you don't...

418
00:29:52,889 --> 00:29:54,419
I'll...

419
00:29:55,189 --> 00:29:57,090
Du Ah, I didn't mean it.

420
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,679
Yes, Professor. I'll be
right there. Just a moment.

421
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,399
PHOTOS

422
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,260
THIS FOLDER IS EMPTY.

423
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,330
Why has the cloud
been wiped clean?

424
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:38,869
This is where Sang
Woo saves his photos.

425
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:41,810
Did he delete them on purpose?

426
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:43,740
What the...

427
00:30:48,109 --> 00:30:51,320
Oh, hey. Is Sang Woo not here?

428
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,090
Yes, it seems like he
stepped out for a moment.

429
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,290
Did you have an appointment?

430
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,590
Oh, I must be here early.

431
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:00,959
I guess he'll be here.

432
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,740
He'll soon be here, right?

433
00:31:16,469 --> 00:31:17,810
Anyway, take care.

434
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,280
Sure thing. I'll see you around.

435
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,980
No, it's fine. It's no big deal.

436
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,850
I found her intriguing.

437
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,189
- Du Ah?
- Yes.

438
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:32,219
I get this from
students these days.

439
00:31:32,459 --> 00:31:34,320
They have strong egos...

440
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,889
but nothing of substance.
Du Ah's like that too.

441
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:38,560
She thinks that
what she learned...

442
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,899
is the way of the universe
and wants to apply...

443
00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:42,600
technological terms and
theories everywhere.

444
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:45,639
I guess I know the type.

445
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,310
It's adorable,

446
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:52,540
but her thoughts are
still quite young.

447
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,449
She believes she has
great insight on things,

448
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,980
so who am I to burst her bubble?

449
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:00,480
Kids her age are all like that.

450
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,260
- Su Min.
- Yes?

451
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,020
- Did you see the post?
- Which one?

452
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:09,590
The three-timing girl from
Social Science Class of 2017.

453
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:12,060
No way. Who is it though?

454
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,030
I don't know, but aren't
her legs to die for?

455
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,399
No wonder she's able to
date three guys at once.

456
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:18,600
Did a peeping Tom take this?

457
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,969
- Beats me.
- Is there more about her?

458
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,109
I think I have an idea
of who it is though.

459
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:24,639
Who?

460
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,750
Du Ah?

461
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,359
Sorry.

462
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:41,889
What's that?

463
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:47,359
You see, I suddenly
had this wild thought.

464
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,399
"Could that be the only
photo which was taken of me?"

465
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:55,469
Perhaps, did he try to get
more photos of me and...

466
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,240
Are you talking
about your house?

467
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,780
Yes. A device
could've been set up.

468
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,080
It's why I bought this gadget.

469
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:07,080
Can this small device
help you locate anything?

470
00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:11,590
It detects
electromagnetic waves.

471
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,290
So if there's a camera in there,

472
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:15,790
a light will bounce off of it...

473
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,929
no matter how small
the camera is.

474
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,929
Have you checked? Have
you given it a try?

475
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:24,469
No.

476
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:28,139
I was too scared to go inside.

477
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:32,540
It terrifies me to think that
a device could be in there.

478
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,350
It's why I can't
get myself to go in.

479
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:38,919
Give me that.

480
00:33:40,449 --> 00:33:43,990
I'll do it instead. I'll see
if there are any cameras.

481
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:49,159
No, wait. I'll come with you.

482
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:51,760
I want to.

483
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,859
Come on.

484
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:35,009
Wait. What was that?

485
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:40,440
Nothing's there.

486
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,020
How did things get this far?

487
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:54,219
I'm just glad nothing is here.

488
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:57,759
So how did it go...

489
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,900
with your search?

490
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:02,199
Don't ask. It's so annoying.

491
00:35:02,299 --> 00:35:05,500
Tell me what's going on. You're
running out of time anyway.

492
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:09,610
What is it that
you want to hear?

493
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:10,940
Anything.

494
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:14,139
Why though?

495
00:35:14,909 --> 00:35:16,679
So that you can laugh at me?

496
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:18,980
Fine, we'll laugh together.

497
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:24,219
You asked me why I
didn't confront them...

498
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,920
even though I knew it was
one of the three, right?

499
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:28,759
Yes, you're right.

500
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:31,190
I didn't want to admit
that I was wrong.

501
00:35:31,489 --> 00:35:32,560
But...

502
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,330
do you know what's hilarious?

503
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,230
I've been completely fooled.

504
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:41,710
I thought that I
was in control...

505
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:45,380
and that I had all three of
them perfectly under control.

506
00:35:45,779 --> 00:35:49,480
Far from it. They were
fooling me the whole time.

507
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,449
All of them.

508
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,619
All three of them.

509
00:35:55,889 --> 00:35:57,750
I thought that
the younger guy...

510
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,190
had been head over
heels for me for years.

511
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,989
In reality, he was a psycho...

512
00:36:01,989 --> 00:36:05,060
who uses women who
like him as ATMs.

513
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,900
Are these all...

514
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,900
I believed that the old guy...

515
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,069
was generous enough to
embrace all my weaknesses.

516
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,509
But her thoughts are
still quite young.

517
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:17,770
Sure, I'll introduce
you to her. We're close.

518
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:21,949
While pretending to be easy-going,
he talks behind his girl's back.

519
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:23,580
Such a mean pervert.

520
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:34,460
The other guy, the
good-looking one,

521
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:39,529
turns out to be a
huge narcissist...

522
00:36:39,529 --> 00:36:41,060
who loves no one but himself.

523
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:44,569
It's not me that he wanted.

524
00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:47,600
He was just intoxicated
by himself...

525
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,810
having sex with an attractive,
smart girl like me.

526
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,339
While I thought the three of
them make one perfect man,

527
00:36:52,339 --> 00:36:55,449
all three of them
turn out to be trash!

528
00:36:57,179 --> 00:36:58,420
Trash?

529
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,319
Aren't you the one...

530
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:02,819
who fooled them first?

531
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:05,520
There was no trust
there to begin with.

532
00:37:06,819 --> 00:37:08,589
What were you expecting?

533
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:12,199
All of those guys
wanted me first.

534
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:14,330
I gave them as much
as they wanted...

535
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,969
and expected to get
just as much in return.

536
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,699
Is this some kind of deal?

537
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:20,540
Dating is a relationship
between two people.

538
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:24,040
It's important that partners benefit
equally from the relationship.

539
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,710
That's the value of dating.

540
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,139
"Benefit"?

541
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,580
Who cares about
that when dating?

542
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,679
Are you sure...

543
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:34,250
you're not the one with prejudice
or fantasies about dating?

544
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:37,549
Emotional stability, a bond,

545
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:41,159
comfort, admiration, fun,
and sexual satisfaction.

546
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,460
Those are the benefits.

547
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,659
I wanted all of that,

548
00:37:44,659 --> 00:37:47,600
but no one man could give me those.
That's why I dated more than one.

549
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,670
Is that so wrong?

550
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:53,369
I worked hard to
get what I want.

551
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:55,210
Was that for your partners?

552
00:37:56,409 --> 00:37:57,670
Or for yourself?

553
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:05,819
Du Ah, dating is not research.

554
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:08,819
You do it with your
heart, not your head.

555
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:12,219
So? Are you saying
I was wrong...

556
00:38:12,219 --> 00:38:14,619
and deserved what happened?

557
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,929
No.

558
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,560
I feel sorry for you.

559
00:38:19,759 --> 00:38:20,860
Did you break up with me...

560
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,600
to live like this?

561
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:30,040
- Han Wool.
- You must be tired. I'll be going.

562
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:32,779
Wait.

563
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:50,529
DID YOU GUYS SEE
THIS ON THE FORUM?

564
00:38:50,759 --> 00:38:52,060
VIDEO OF THE THREE-TIMING
GIRL AT S UNIVERSITY

565
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,770
S UNIVERSITY'S ONLINE COMMUNITY
IS BLOWING UP ABOUT THIS GIRL.

566
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,040
- What a horrible person.
- Disgusting.

567
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,739
- It's sick.
- I hate people like that.

568
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,509
- I heard she's in our department.
- I feel sorry for the guys.

569
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:04,509
I'm scared my girlfriend
might be like her.

570
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,440
- What a disgrace to our school.
- You should die.

571
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,480
How awful.

572
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,049
- I loathe people like her.
- I hope she dies.

573
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:19,940
What's wrong?

574
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,179
Come in.

575
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,920
- Do you feel okay now?
- Yes.

576
00:41:35,929 --> 00:41:40,429
So? Did you check what
made the alarm go off?

577
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,170
No.

578
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:44,029
I was too scared.

579
00:41:44,299 --> 00:41:47,199
I'll go check. Wait here.

580
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:31,270
No, don't...

581
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:44,650
Oh, I'm at Han Wool's.

582
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,659
Why on earth did I
sleep here last night?

583
00:43:49,659 --> 00:43:51,730
Right, now I remember.

584
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:58,969
Han Wool?

585
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:01,469
Do Han Wool?

586
00:44:02,969 --> 00:44:04,339
Maybe he went to the
convenience store.

587
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:07,739
BUK-BOOGIE

588
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:08,739
Hey.

589
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,549
Where's your dad?

590
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:13,619
BUK-BOOGIE

591
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:23,190
Is this password-protected?

592
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:32,069
Yes, I knew it.

593
00:44:32,799 --> 00:44:36,069
It's not like he has
anything to hide.

594
00:44:37,069 --> 00:44:39,380
What's with all these photos?

595
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,989
Why does he have this?

596
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,060
Could this be the original?

597
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:06,339
What...

598
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,580
Hold on.

599
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:38,529
Do Han Wool...

600
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:52,549
Where is it?

601
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:57,150
It's not here.
Why isn't it here?

602
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,860
It's not in his closet!

603
00:46:51,339 --> 00:46:52,980
Why?

604
00:46:56,549 --> 00:46:57,949
Where are you right now?

605
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:01,380
WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?

606
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,690
CURRENTLY ONLINE

607
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:05,250
Han Si Han?

608
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,770
I have something to say...

609
00:47:21,799 --> 00:47:23,339
regarding the online post
associated with this photo.

610
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:25,639
Meet me at 11am tomorrow...

611
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,480
under the big tree
at Changrim Park.

612
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:33,049
WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?

613
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:57,839
Well,

614
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:00,350
is this direct message true?

615
00:48:00,709 --> 00:48:02,819
Is Du Ah really the girl that's dating...

616
00:48:02,819 --> 00:48:03,979
three guys at once?

617
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,489
I didn't send the message.

618
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:08,489
Ghosh. I'm not getting any replies.

619
00:48:24,739 --> 00:48:25,770
Yes.

620
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,249
I also think we'd be
better off just as friends.

621
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:35,849
If we start dating each other,
we might fight and break up.

622
00:48:35,849 --> 00:48:37,179
And I don't like that.

623
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,989
Let's just continue to be friends
like we have been all this time.

624
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,459
I'm okay.

625
00:48:54,069 --> 00:48:55,269
Love and hatred.

626
00:48:57,669 --> 00:48:59,969
When love meets a sense of betrayal,

627
00:49:00,269 --> 00:49:01,939
it turns into resentment.

628
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:17,159
So Du Ah admitted that she
was seeing the three of us.

629
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:20,430
And she thinks one of us wrote that post?

630
00:49:20,889 --> 00:49:22,130
That's it. Right?

631
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:23,200
Yes.

632
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,359
Based on what?

633
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:26,370
It has to be one of you guys...

634
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:30,269
because the person who posted that
has recently been inside her house.

635
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:32,409
Where are you going?

636
00:49:32,409 --> 00:49:34,710
I don't understand why I should stay.

637
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:36,079
I see. So it was you?

638
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,180
Don't talk nonsense. I
just found out about it.

639
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:40,650
- You know what?
- Get your hands off me.

640
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:42,249
- Hey.
- Just sit down.

641
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:50,460
Tell me the truth. You three
had no idea about that post?

642
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:51,930
Of course, not!

643
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:54,630
An online community forum?
Who does that? It's so petty.

644
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:57,100
Fine. Let's say one of us found out.

645
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:59,970
Why would anyone post that there?
It's like disgracing yourself.

646
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:01,669
You might not know this because you're young.

647
00:50:01,669 --> 00:50:04,000
If you post anything on that
forum, it only takes seconds...

648
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,739
for everyone at school to find out.

649
00:50:05,739 --> 00:50:08,139
Right. Why would we post something like that?

650
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:09,839
- Do you have evidence?
- First,

651
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,010
let's check the facts.

652
00:50:15,549 --> 00:50:17,149
What's your relationship with her?

653
00:50:18,019 --> 00:50:19,549
My relationship with her?

654
00:50:20,019 --> 00:50:21,049
Well...

655
00:50:21,959 --> 00:50:23,260
Let's do it by a show of hands.

656
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:27,190
Raise your hand if you held her hand.

657
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,459
My goodness. We're not some five-year-olds.

658
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:30,600
What is this?

659
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:36,639
Darn it.

660
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:40,410
First base, anyone?

661
00:50:46,549 --> 00:50:47,750
Beyond first base?

662
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:07,500
Did you sleep with her?

663
00:51:07,869 --> 00:51:08,970
You didn't?

664
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:11,709
Hey!

665
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:13,910
What did you just say?

666
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:16,839
"Hey"? How dare you talk
to me like that? You jerk.

667
00:51:16,839 --> 00:51:18,750
There are some things you
should just keep to yourself.

668
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:20,880
Gosh. Do you want to duke it out, pretty boy?

669
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,380
- Gosh. Do you think you can fight?
- You jerk!

670
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:25,889
- Come here. Fine. Let's do it.
- Sure. Go ahead.

671
00:51:25,889 --> 00:51:26,989
- How many times?
- Gosh.

672
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:28,989
How many times did you do it?

673
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:31,489
- Gosh.
- Why does that matter now?

674
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,760
Wait a minute. Yes, it does matter.

675
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,660
You only kissed her a few times.
That's not a serious relationship.

676
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,929
I don't think she was serious
with you two. Aren't I right?

677
00:51:37,929 --> 00:51:39,169
Hey.

678
00:51:39,169 --> 00:51:40,570
What about you? Having sex doesn't
mean it was a serious relationship.

679
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:41,940
You were just friends with benefits.

680
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,070
- What? Friends with benefits?
- Hey.

681
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:44,269
- Hey.
- Were you there?

682
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:45,440
How do you know it wasn't more than just sex?

683
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,769
- Hey, were you there?
- He's guilty.

684
00:51:46,769 --> 00:51:48,070
He's overreacting because he's guilty.

685
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:50,040
He was just some warm body she had sex with.

686
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,780
She didn't see him as a real...

687
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:53,579
Hey, what are you doing?

688
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:55,350
- Stop that.
- Stay out of it.

689
00:51:55,649 --> 00:51:56,850
Come on.

690
00:51:57,149 --> 00:51:58,190
Geez.

691
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:01,350
- Hey, let go of me.
- Hey.

692
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:02,619
- Hey!
- You, come here.

693
00:52:07,729 --> 00:52:08,860
Gosh.

694
00:52:26,349 --> 00:52:28,279
To me, Du Ah was...

695
00:52:29,219 --> 00:52:31,789
a woman who had so much respect
from me before my girlfriend.

696
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:34,620
And we were perfect for each other.

697
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,789
We had the same styles,
habits, palate, and everything.

698
00:52:36,789 --> 00:52:38,560
We saw eye to eye on everything.

699
00:52:39,029 --> 00:52:42,260
I was a year younger than her,
but she always respected me.

700
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:43,729
Same here.

701
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,399
I didn't feel any age gap with her.

702
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:51,500
We were truly equal in our relationship.

703
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:55,779
Since I wanted a serious
long-term relationship with her,

704
00:52:56,709 --> 00:52:58,979
I didn't sleep with her right away.

705
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:05,490
Waiting has nothing to
do with cherishing her.

706
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,789
If you love someone, don't you want
to touch her and make love to her?

707
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:15,430
DU AH

708
00:53:17,829 --> 00:53:19,500
Hey, stop crying.

709
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:27,670
Du Ah.

710
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,229
Who on earth are you?

711
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,430
What?

712
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,969
No matter how hard I tried to
think, or understand what you did,

713
00:53:54,969 --> 00:53:56,399
I don't get it.

714
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,709
Why did you do it?

715
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:02,310
It was you of all people.

716
00:54:02,909 --> 00:54:04,709
Why did you post my photos...

717
00:54:04,709 --> 00:54:06,510
and write something like that on that forum?

718
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:10,620
Please make me understand why you did it.

719
00:54:11,019 --> 00:54:12,120
Calm down. And say that again.

720
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,620
What are you talking about?
Do you think I posted it?

721
00:54:19,659 --> 00:54:21,829
That's my tablet PC.

722
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:25,130
Check what's in the
gallery on your tablet PC.

723
00:54:35,779 --> 00:54:36,839
These photos...

724
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:40,010
Why are they in my tablet PC?

725
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:42,019
Are you asking me that?

726
00:54:43,579 --> 00:54:45,190
I really didn't know why these photos...

727
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:47,289
Hold on.

728
00:54:56,399 --> 00:54:57,500
No.

729
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:00,800
No. This is a misunderstanding.

730
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:02,170
I really didn't know about this.

731
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:05,170
I think the photos I have in my phone...

732
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:06,940
got synced to my tablet PC.

733
00:55:07,539 --> 00:55:08,909
Why did you do it?

734
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:11,610
Why are you asking me that?

735
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:13,979
There's no way I would
do something like that.

736
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:16,950
I'm telling the truth. Listen.

737
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:19,289
I just found out that I had
these photos in my phone.

738
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:21,349
I found out because you pointed it out.

739
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:23,120
You know that I sometimes take photos...

740
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,659
because I accidentally tap the wrong buttons.

741
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:27,690
Then, where were you just now?

742
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,860
Just now?

743
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,430
I was with them just now.

744
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,240
The three guys you were dating.

745
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,170
Why would you meet those three?

746
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:40,070
There's not much time left.

747
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,810
- We must sort this out.
- Without telling me?

748
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:45,950
You wouldn't have told me if
I hadn't asked, would you?

749
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:47,849
You're doing this...

750
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,279
and you want me to trust you?

751
00:55:51,279 --> 00:55:54,190
I didn't tell you first in
case you get the wrong idea.

752
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:55,959
When I figured out which of them did this,

753
00:55:55,959 --> 00:55:57,589
I was going to tell you then.

754
00:55:57,589 --> 00:55:59,760
So which of the three was it?

755
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:03,029
I don't know.

756
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,969
Maybe finding the culprit
wasn't your goal at all.

757
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:15,180
Not only did you make that post,

758
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:16,810
but you wanted to...

759
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:19,849
meet the three guys and
ruin my messy relationships.

760
00:56:20,909 --> 00:56:22,380
What are you saying?

761
00:56:23,749 --> 00:56:26,390
- Why would I do that?
- Because you hate me.

762
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,560
Because you think...

763
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:32,930
I ignore your feelings and do as I please.

764
00:56:34,089 --> 00:56:36,259
You think I hate you,

765
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:41,700
so I want to ruin your
relationships with those guys?

766
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,170
Wasn't that the reason you wrote
that post in the first place?

767
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:56,180
Yes. It's true that I resent you.

768
00:56:58,379 --> 00:57:00,190
How could you do this to me?

769
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,820
I asked if you broke up
with me just to do this.

770
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:07,959
I was serious.

771
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:10,700
When this happened,

772
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,900
you first suspected those three guys.

773
00:57:13,829 --> 00:57:16,499
You nonchalantly dated
three guys at the same time,

774
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:19,410
and suspected them as soon
as something happened.

775
00:57:20,469 --> 00:57:23,440
I resented you for leaving me
just to do something like this.

776
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:26,209
Are you done talking?

777
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:29,219
What makes you so special?

778
00:57:29,219 --> 00:57:30,680
I'm not special.

779
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:33,089
That's why you dumped me.

780
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,320
You did the right thing.

781
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,089
I'm actually a really selfish piece of trash.

782
00:57:39,229 --> 00:57:42,129
I wished that you'd suffer as much as I did,

783
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,759
and when I saw what happened
to you after what you did...

784
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:46,969
Yes.

785
00:57:48,469 --> 00:57:49,940
You had it coming.

786
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:51,469
That darn post.

787
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:54,310
It should've been me who wrote it!

788
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:02,680
Do Han Wool!

789
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:10,320
Excuse me.

790
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:12,589
Excuse me.

791
00:58:14,829 --> 00:58:17,660
Wasn't that Do Han Wool guy a bit suspicious?

792
00:58:18,129 --> 00:58:20,170
Could he be the one who wrote the post?

793
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:22,999
- I thought so too.
- Isn't he actually...

794
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:25,869
the one who knows most about Du Ah?

795
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:28,170
He's obviously the most likely suspect.

796
00:58:28,369 --> 00:58:30,410
It's possible that all this...

797
00:58:30,739 --> 00:58:34,849
was Do Han Wool's big picture.

798
00:58:35,219 --> 00:58:37,180
- What big picture?
- Let's say that...

799
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,390
- he has feelings for Du Ah.
- Yes.

800
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,390
And he found out that
she's dating three guys.

801
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,560
- Yes.
- How would you ruin that?

802
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:48,129
You're right.

803
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:50,400
We shouldn't just sit back and watch.

804
00:58:50,999 --> 00:58:53,369
The three of us should
get together for a chat.

805
00:58:53,629 --> 00:58:54,900
Sure.

806
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,170
What's his name? Sang Woo?

807
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:58,609
Where'd he go?

808
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:01,570
He's over there.

809
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:03,479
What are you doing?

810
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:08,079
Is that alcohol? My gosh.

811
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:09,849
Give me that.

812
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:12,520
Let's have a real drink. It's okay.

813
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,249
Let's go and have our chat.

814
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:35,140
I resented you for leaving me
just to do something like this.

815
00:59:35,509 --> 00:59:37,280
I'm not special.

816
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,079
That's why you dumped me.

817
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,450
What a jerk.

818
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,589
What's going on?

819
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:07,070
We are victims.

820
01:00:07,709 --> 01:00:10,709
We're bleeding a gruesome amount.

821
01:00:10,709 --> 01:00:12,379
We're victims.

822
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:14,479
Yes.

823
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:18,119
How could she do this to us?

824
01:00:24,359 --> 01:00:26,729
Why are you crying again?

825
01:00:28,729 --> 01:00:30,160
That's enough!

826
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:33,999
Yes. Let's get together.

827
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:37,270
We must think of our pride now at least.

828
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,369
None of us are to see Nam Du Ah again.

829
01:00:40,369 --> 01:00:41,969
- Yes!
- Let's do that.

830
01:00:41,969 --> 01:00:44,839
Let's ditch her. Delete her
number. Delete her number.

831
01:00:44,839 --> 01:00:47,349
Don't call her. And don't take her calls.

832
01:00:47,349 --> 01:00:49,020
- Delete it.
- Delete it.

833
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,749
I deleted it!

834
01:00:50,749 --> 01:00:52,820
- You deleted it!
- You deleted it.

835
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:54,989
Let's cheer each other on.

836
01:00:54,989 --> 01:00:56,219
1, 2, 3.

837
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:58,660
- Let's do this!
- Let's do this!

838
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,259
- Let's have a drink.
- What's this?

839
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:05,570
DU AH

840
01:01:11,469 --> 01:01:12,670
Don't do it.

841
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:14,170
DU AH

842
01:01:15,579 --> 01:01:17,280
DU AH

843
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:20,950
Of course, I won't take it.

844
01:01:21,349 --> 01:01:23,379
- I'm a man.
- Yes, you are.

845
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:25,619
DU AH

846
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,900
Am I your second choice or something?

847
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,369
Forget it.

848
01:01:47,509 --> 01:01:48,810
It's an alarm.

849
01:01:51,609 --> 01:01:53,180
Should we order more alcohol?

850
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:55,349
- Ma'am!
- Hold back.

851
01:01:55,349 --> 01:01:59,020
Come on. Let's not do this.

852
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:02,820
We should not let Du Ah control us!

853
01:02:06,329 --> 01:02:08,930
We can't go down like this.

854
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:20,969
Why won't anyone pick up?

855
01:02:24,739 --> 01:02:27,509
Now I can't find out who posted it.

856
01:02:29,849 --> 01:02:32,050
I have just one day left.

857
01:02:35,959 --> 01:02:39,790
THE DOUBLE LIFE OF A
CLASS 2021 HISTORY MAJOR

858
01:02:40,489 --> 01:02:43,999
No. Don't give up.

859
01:02:44,959 --> 01:02:47,200
Like Do Han Wool said,

860
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,700
I should contact the forum moderator.

861
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:55,070
I'm hungry.

862
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:58,339
I didn't eat anything all day.

863
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:17,859
What a jerk.

864
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:21,170
Why do you always look at my
tablet PC without my permission?

865
01:03:21,629 --> 01:03:22,770
It's mine, you know.

866
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:27,170
You never keep it locked, and
you always put it wherever.

867
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:29,180
So I kind of thought of it as mine.

868
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:34,479
That's right. Han Wool
never locked his tablet PC.

869
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:46,359
What if someone knew it was his,

870
01:03:46,459 --> 01:03:50,430
found my photo in there either
by coincidence or on purpose,

871
01:03:52,599 --> 01:03:55,999
and sent it to his or her cell phone?

872
01:03:59,509 --> 01:04:00,509
ACCEPT

873
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:05,379
Yes, that's totally plausible.

874
01:04:11,249 --> 01:04:12,550
OCTOBER 19, 2020, REVELATION D-DAY

875
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,089
Why didn't I think of this?

876
01:04:21,129 --> 01:04:23,900
- Du Ah.
- Let me see your tablet PC.

877
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:25,259
What? Okay.

878
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:29,239
Where's the photo?

879
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:35,339
October 8, 4pm.

880
01:04:36,209 --> 01:04:37,739
Yes, my memory was right.

881
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:41,249
- Hey, hurry up.
- I'm out.

882
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:43,879
The day Han Wool came over to my house.

883
01:04:43,879 --> 01:04:45,790
- Let me go to the bathroom.
- My gosh, come on.

884
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:50,060
Then it happened four days after that day.

885
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:53,829
Did you show your tablet PC to anyone...

886
01:04:53,829 --> 01:04:55,759
between October 9 and October 12, 7pm?

887
01:04:55,759 --> 01:04:57,360
Did anyone look through your tablet PC?

888
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,200
Wait a second.

889
01:05:00,299 --> 01:05:03,340
Did you take it to school
or leave it anywhere?

890
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:04,499
Think about it carefully.

891
01:05:04,499 --> 01:05:06,370
I know you had it with you over the weekend.

892
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:07,610
Friday. What about on Friday?

893
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,180
I only had one class, but it
got canceled, so I stayed home.

894
01:05:10,309 --> 01:05:11,309
What about Monday?

895
01:05:11,309 --> 01:05:13,680
I went to school that day
because I had a team meeting.

896
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,819
Did you go somewhere
without your tablet PC...

897
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:18,380
during the team meeting?

898
01:05:21,049 --> 01:05:23,719
Think about it carefully.
That's when it happened.

899
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:26,729
That's the only time anyone
could've stolen that photo from you.

900
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:30,660
I remember going to the bathroom with Jun Su.

901
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:33,330
And you didn't take your tablet PC with you?

902
01:05:34,999 --> 01:05:36,069
No.

903
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:39,239
How many people were on your team?

904
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,539
Three in total including myself.

905
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:45,180
Lee Ju Yeon?

906
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:47,009
What did you say?

907
01:05:47,209 --> 01:05:48,779
But what are you going
to do after you find out?

908
01:05:48,779 --> 01:05:51,150
Just tell me. I'll deal with it on my own.

909
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:52,549
It might not be her.

910
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:54,049
And even if it is, don't
deal with it on your own.

911
01:05:54,049 --> 01:05:55,249
Han Wool.

912
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:58,420
Lee Ju Yeon.

913
01:05:59,559 --> 01:06:00,590
She studies the same major as you.

914
01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:04,299
Same major as me?

915
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:13,009
I'm off now.

916
01:06:16,509 --> 01:06:17,509
Du Ah.

917
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:21,380
About what I said earlier...

918
01:06:24,749 --> 01:06:27,650
I was a bit too harsh.

919
01:06:28,819 --> 01:06:29,819
I'm sorry.

920
01:06:33,559 --> 01:06:35,160
Was it all a lie?

921
01:06:36,999 --> 01:06:40,529
You meant every word you said,
so you don't need to be sorry.

922
01:07:03,789 --> 01:07:06,729
I'm so honored that I got to interview you.

923
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:08,890
I'm a huge fan.

924
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:11,200
I really loved the lecture you did last time.

925
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,799
Another student was supposed to interview me,

926
01:07:13,799 --> 01:07:16,499
but she suddenly had to deal
with a personal problem.

927
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,840
By any chance, are you
talking about Nam Du Ah?

928
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:21,410
Oh, right. You guys study the same major.

929
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:23,680
Did something happen to her?

930
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,150
I can't tell you specifically.

931
01:07:26,979 --> 01:07:29,650
But I heard she's getting
ready to sue someone...

932
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:31,279
because that person uploaded
her personal life online.

933
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:35,519
Did someone say something false about her?

934
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:39,190
Well, I wouldn't say it was completely false.

935
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:44,299
But even if it's true, she can still
sue that person for defamation.

936
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:48,799
She shouldn't have done anything
to get her in that position.

937
01:07:49,029 --> 01:07:51,799
Why would she file a lawsuit
when she's the one at fault?

938
01:07:51,799 --> 01:07:55,469
Why do assailants always have
the same kind of argument?

939
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:57,410
What?

940
01:07:58,039 --> 01:07:59,039
How did you...

941
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:01,110
How did I know it was you?

942
01:08:02,049 --> 01:08:03,080
The photo.

943
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:06,650
The photo you sent from Han Wool's tablet PC.

944
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:08,450
That was the key evidence.

945
01:08:11,759 --> 01:08:13,459
- "Who's the culprit?"
- Then our team should...

946
01:08:13,559 --> 01:08:16,330
"Who stole that photo and
uploaded a post online?"

947
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:18,499
The source was the tablet PC.

948
01:08:18,959 --> 01:08:22,700
The tablet PC was left unattended
on Monday during the team meeting.

949
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:27,440
- Ju Yeon.
- That left me with two suspects.

950
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:32,809
His teammates, Hong Jun Su and Lee Ju Yeon.

951
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,979
Let's go to the bathroom.

952
01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:40,850
I'm not sure if you meant
bad from the very beginning.

953
01:08:42,219 --> 01:08:45,759
At first, you could've
done it out of curiosity.

954
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:50,559
You looked through his tablet
PC since it wasn't locked,

955
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:53,630
and you happened to find
a photo of me in there.

956
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:56,999
Then you sent it to your cell phone.

957
01:08:57,469 --> 01:09:01,809
You could've done all that impulsively.

958
01:09:02,069 --> 01:09:03,539
But three days later,

959
01:09:04,309 --> 01:09:07,249
you used that photo to upload a post online.

960
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:09,479
And that wasn't you being
impulsive or curious.

961
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,019
You did it out of malice.

962
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:16,059
You thought it was safe since that
photo was from Han Wool's tablet PC.

963
01:09:16,459 --> 01:09:18,319
Then you trimmed the photo and uploaded it...

964
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:19,759
so it'd be hard to recognize who it was.

965
01:09:19,959 --> 01:09:21,729
And you were careful with what you wrote...

966
01:09:21,729 --> 01:09:23,459
so that it wouldn't get
you in any legal trouble.

967
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:28,370
If anything went south, you
were going to frame Han Wool.

968
01:09:28,469 --> 01:09:31,140
You minimized the possibility
of your getting in danger,

969
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:34,309
and at the same time, you managed
to attack me very successfully.

970
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:38,440
Do you have nothing better to do?

971
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,749
- Hey.
- Why did you bother to do all that?

972
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:43,180
And...

973
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:48,289
how did you know that I
was dating three guys?

974
01:09:50,489 --> 01:09:51,759
You want to know why I did it?

975
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:57,029
You think everyone is a joke, don't you?

976
01:09:57,529 --> 01:09:58,799
You look down on everyone.

977
01:09:58,959 --> 01:10:00,569
You don't treat people as human beings.

978
01:10:00,569 --> 01:10:01,969
You think of them like tools or nice scenery.

979
01:10:02,299 --> 01:10:05,840
That's why you didn't even think
it was necessary to hide it.

980
01:10:06,539 --> 01:10:07,769
It was so obvious.

981
01:10:07,769 --> 01:10:09,940
The guys are dumb to have gotten fooled.

982
01:10:10,779 --> 01:10:12,479
There wasn't a grand
motivation behind what I did.

983
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,580
I just don't like you. That's why.

984
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:18,350
Girls like you are the reason
why people badmouth women.

985
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:20,190
You go around dating anyone.

986
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:21,789
You're so easy and have
no morals or ethics...

987
01:10:22,249 --> 01:10:23,860
Gosh, I'm sorry.

988
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:26,390
I couldn't bear to hear what
was coming out of your mouth.

989
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:28,390
- Hey!
- What do you mean I'm easy?

990
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:30,299
I'm not easy at all.

991
01:10:30,299 --> 01:10:31,999
I don't date just anyone.

992
01:10:31,999 --> 01:10:35,569
I picked my guys. They just
happened to be more than one.

993
01:10:35,569 --> 01:10:37,840
- That kind of attitude is...
- But...

994
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:41,140
how is that the reason
why women get badmouthed?

995
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:43,880
If you think I did something wrong,

996
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:45,479
you should badmouth me.

997
01:10:46,150 --> 01:10:49,719
If people blame my actions on my gender,

998
01:10:49,719 --> 01:10:51,620
that only shows how uneducated they are.

999
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,819
Girls like you are the problem, not me.

1000
01:10:55,819 --> 01:10:57,860
Girls like you make a ridiculous
generalization like...

1001
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:00,160
"Women are their own enemies."

1002
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:02,660
And you conveniently give
an excuse to some fools.

1003
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:06,269
If you don't like how I
behave, just say it to my face.

1004
01:11:06,529 --> 01:11:08,529
And if you don't want to face me,

1005
01:11:08,529 --> 01:11:10,600
just badmouth me to your friends.

1006
01:11:11,799 --> 01:11:13,940
What you did was a foul play...

1007
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:16,180
because you knew that the method you chose...

1008
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:18,910
was the most humiliating way
to attack me as a fellow woman.

1009
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:21,410
And that's what you were going for.

1010
01:11:22,749 --> 01:11:24,580
You are so annoying.

1011
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:26,890
Yes. So what?

1012
01:11:26,890 --> 01:11:28,519
You're so irritating.

1013
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:37,459
It would've been nice if
this was the end of it.

1014
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:39,160
But this is unfortunate.

1015
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:40,729
Pardon?

1016
01:11:41,499 --> 01:11:44,840
Your photo got posted, after all.

1017
01:11:48,709 --> 01:11:51,110
"THE IDENTITY OF THE DOUBLE-LIFE
SEXY BRAINSTORM REVEALED"

1018
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:01,719
These jerks.

1019
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:13,469
I should have talked with
everyone from the get-go.

1020
01:12:15,769 --> 01:12:17,340
If I had done that...

1021
01:12:18,969 --> 01:12:21,170
- "Identity of the Double-Life..."
- "Identity of the Double-Life..."

1022
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,610
- "Sexy Brainstorm Revealed".
- "Sexy Brainstorm Revealed".

1023
01:12:25,809 --> 01:12:28,680
This lame post wouldn't have
been up in the first place.

1024
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:33,019
Did you think I wouldn't know?
Or did you do this on purpose?

1025
01:12:33,249 --> 01:12:36,090
Every sentence in this post is
poorly constructed and immature.

1026
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:39,289
This is quite embarrassing
to read this, Da Ham.

1027
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:41,529
"She was..."

1028
01:12:41,529 --> 01:12:43,759
"a coldhearted woman, unable
to love anyone by nature."

1029
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:44,959
"Coldhearted"?

1030
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,370
COOL-HEARTED

1031
01:12:46,370 --> 01:12:48,999
"She exploited men's fatefulness for her."

1032
01:12:48,999 --> 01:12:50,969
"Cool-hearted"? It's "coldhearted".

1033
01:12:50,969 --> 01:12:52,340
You knew what that meant
when you typed it, right?

1034
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:53,670
It means I'm a cold person.

1035
01:12:53,809 --> 01:12:55,239
- Listen...
- Whenever you misspelled words,

1036
01:12:55,239 --> 01:12:57,180
it was such a turn-off. Did you know that?

1037
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:01,850
Oh, right. Si Han, you provided the photo.

1038
01:13:02,749 --> 01:13:04,380
Did you think I wouldn't
know it came from you?

1039
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,620
DA? Du Ah's Folder?

1040
01:13:06,650 --> 01:13:09,489
You saved every single photo
I posted on my social media.

1041
01:13:09,489 --> 01:13:12,019
I posted the photos but
deleted them right away.

1042
01:13:12,019 --> 01:13:13,430
And you're the only one who would save them.

1043
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:17,130
Of course. Sang Woo, you
were the one who came up...

1044
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:18,759
with the idea, right?

1045
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:21,569
Du Ah is planning to go to
a graduate school next year.

1046
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:24,170
- Let's write that.
- Graduate school.

1047
01:13:24,170 --> 01:13:26,769
And among the three of you,
you were the only one...

1048
01:13:26,769 --> 01:13:29,509
who knew I was preparing to
attend a graduate school.

1049
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:34,749
All of you were sloppy with the post.

1050
01:13:34,749 --> 01:13:37,319
Then, did you call us here,
so you can tell us that?

1051
01:13:37,319 --> 01:13:38,580
You lied. You said you wanted to see us.

1052
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:41,319
I didn't want to "see" you in a good way.

1053
01:13:41,319 --> 01:13:42,519
What did you expect?

1054
01:13:42,519 --> 01:13:45,360
Now that you know we were behind that,

1055
01:13:45,459 --> 01:13:48,360
- you called us here, so...
- We're breaking up.

1056
01:13:49,090 --> 01:13:52,430
How can I be in a relationship
with guys who exposed me like this?

1057
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:57,499
How could you break up with us in a group?

1058
01:13:57,499 --> 01:13:59,469
Efficiency isn't the key here.

1059
01:13:59,469 --> 01:14:01,309
You should know there are
etiquettes in breakups.

1060
01:14:01,309 --> 01:14:04,140
Don't expect any etiquettes from a
girl who dates three guys at once.

1061
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:05,910
Were we even in a relationship?

1062
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:08,009
Do you think you can just
toy with people's hearts?

1063
01:14:08,350 --> 01:14:09,819
Which one of us dated you first?

1064
01:14:11,450 --> 01:14:14,219
Why does that matter now?

1065
01:14:14,219 --> 01:14:15,249
No.

1066
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:19,219
After all we've been through,
we deserve to know the truth.

1067
01:14:20,059 --> 01:14:22,529
Will that help you put an end to this?

1068
01:14:22,529 --> 01:14:25,499
Well, we want to hear your answer first.

1069
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:34,110
Number 1, number 2, and number 3.

1070
01:14:34,769 --> 01:14:38,110
Why did you end up dating three guys at once?

1071
01:14:38,410 --> 01:14:42,080
Because I was dating three of you
at once, we never got into fights.

1072
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,880
That's why our relationships were good.

1073
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:46,819
My expectations from you
were within your capacities.

1074
01:14:46,819 --> 01:14:48,590
What was out of my capacities?

1075
01:14:49,219 --> 01:14:51,620
Well, do I have to spell it out for you?

1076
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:52,930
You must.

1077
01:14:52,930 --> 01:14:55,830
I believe relationships require
etiquettes and protocols.

1078
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:57,630
"Etiquettes and protocols"?

1079
01:14:57,630 --> 01:14:59,969
You shouldn't deceive or
betray your partner...

1080
01:14:59,969 --> 01:15:01,299
out of your consideration for
them. That's basic etiquette.

1081
01:15:01,299 --> 01:15:02,729
Just like we started dating through
communication and agreement,

1082
01:15:02,729 --> 01:15:04,140
breakups should follow the same protocol.

1083
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:07,140
That's what you need to do for us.

1084
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:09,940
So you need me to follow
the protocol now, right?

1085
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:13,309
I need to explain to you why
I chose this kind of method.

1086
01:15:13,309 --> 01:15:15,380
Yes. You must explain it to us.

1087
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:20,090
Darn it. I didn't want to talk about this.

1088
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:25,519
Having a guy who had a
crush on me for a year...

1089
01:15:25,559 --> 01:15:27,229
is so valuable...

1090
01:15:27,459 --> 01:15:30,259
because he makes me think
that I'm a good woman.

1091
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:32,100
He makes me feel better.

1092
01:15:32,299 --> 01:15:36,069
But when I wanted to rely
on someone and needed help,

1093
01:15:36,069 --> 01:15:38,539
he couldn't do that for me. Not at all.

1094
01:15:39,170 --> 01:15:41,269
So I satisfied that part of my life...

1095
01:15:41,269 --> 01:15:43,440
by dating a mature man...

1096
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,539
whom I could rely on and ask for help.

1097
01:15:45,539 --> 01:15:49,350
But unfortunately, I wasn't
sexually attracted to him at all.

1098
01:15:51,479 --> 01:15:54,249
And the third guy was able
to satisfy my sexual needs.

1099
01:15:54,319 --> 01:15:56,219
Of course. As for the lacking qualities...

1100
01:15:56,219 --> 01:15:59,590
of the third guy, the other two guys...

1101
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:02,559
definitely filled in for him.

1102
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:08,469
How could you use my
feelings to boost your ego?

1103
01:16:08,469 --> 01:16:11,200
A mature man is still a
man! I have needs too!

1104
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,640
You don't think you can talk to me?

1105
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:15,009
Have you ever tried to talk to
me other than sleeping with me?

1106
01:16:28,989 --> 01:16:31,259
Hey, why aren't you answering your phone?

1107
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:33,789
What is this about?

1108
01:16:33,959 --> 01:16:35,930
I don't want you to be shocked.

1109
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:38,959
Like the culprit warned you,

1110
01:16:39,559 --> 01:16:41,170
there was a post on the
online community forum.

1111
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:42,170
I know.

1112
01:16:42,799 --> 01:16:44,940
- You know?
- Yes.

1113
01:16:45,769 --> 01:16:48,509
But the writing seemed a
bit different. It's weird.

1114
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:50,410
I think...

1115
01:16:52,739 --> 01:16:54,650
Do you have anyone in mind?

1116
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:56,319
The three of them are inside.

1117
01:16:57,150 --> 01:16:59,350
- Who?
- The writers behind the post.

1118
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:02,090
Han Si Han, Yeon Sang Woo, and Yoo Da Ham.

1119
01:17:02,190 --> 01:17:04,019
- What?
- Let's talk later. Bye.

1120
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:06,059
Hey. You can't just go in like that.

1121
01:17:06,059 --> 01:17:07,930
Are you in trouble now?

1122
01:17:09,059 --> 01:17:10,559
I called them here.

1123
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:13,170
So I can break up with all
of them like you suggested.

1124
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,769
- Break up with them?
- You told me to stop all this.

1125
01:17:16,769 --> 01:17:18,600
You wanted me to break up with all of them.

1126
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,269
This all worked out.

1127
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:23,910
I can't date guys who exposed me like that.

1128
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,549
So you called all of them here?

1129
01:17:26,610 --> 01:17:28,950
Yes. That's the easiest
way to deal with this.

1130
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:33,350
Why do you think they wrote a post like that?

1131
01:17:34,749 --> 01:17:35,850
Why?

1132
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:38,759
So you can say you should've
written that yourself?

1133
01:17:40,029 --> 01:17:41,160
Hey.

1134
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:45,700
Why do you keep acting like the victim?

1135
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:47,870
I didn't leave you.

1136
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:50,140
If you were so hurt by our breakup,
you shouldn't have been my friend.

1137
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:51,999
You didn't have to see me.

1138
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:53,840
If you hated me that much,

1139
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,440
why did you stay friends with me?

1140
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,279
How could I not see you?

1141
01:17:58,309 --> 01:18:00,479
I wouldn't be able to live without you.

1142
01:18:02,279 --> 01:18:04,650
After that incident the
day before my enlistment,

1143
01:18:04,819 --> 01:18:07,049
you were the one who went radio silent at me.

1144
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,590
I called you right before I
had to enter my boot camp.

1145
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:14,559
I left voice messages at the
payphone, but you never called.

1146
01:18:17,029 --> 01:18:20,100
And you wanted to stay friends
when I got out on my first leave.

1147
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:22,499
As if nothing happened.

1148
01:18:23,269 --> 01:18:25,670
I couldn't live without you.

1149
01:18:27,009 --> 01:18:29,779
And to stay by your side, being
your friend was the only option.

1150
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:33,350
What other choice did I have?

1151
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:37,150
"Partners benefit equally
from the relationship"?

1152
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:39,420
People you've exchanged benefits with...

1153
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:41,989
made posts like that. Is
that your value of love?

1154
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:46,729
Let me ask just one thing.

1155
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:51,529
Have you ever loved anyone?

1156
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:36,910
Du Ah, are you free?

1157
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:45,549
That post. About the girl
in the class of 2021.

1158
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:47,390
It's you, right?

1159
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:48,890
What do you mean?

1160
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:50,660
Stop pretending.

1161
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:52,390
I could tell right away from the photo.

1162
01:19:52,890 --> 01:19:55,130
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1163
01:19:55,130 --> 01:19:57,799
I'm not trying to rebuke or criticize you...

1164
01:19:57,799 --> 01:19:59,400
for what you did.

1165
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,529
If you're already dating three guys,

1166
01:20:01,529 --> 01:20:04,799
do you think you could squeeze me in?

1167
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:07,940
I don't go around spreading gossip.

1168
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:10,509
I'd always had feelings for you...

1169
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:11,979
for a while now.

1170
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:20,219
You really know nothing about women.

1171
01:20:20,789 --> 01:20:23,920
There's no way you can
get a woman to date you...

1172
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:27,229
by starting a conversation
with blackmail and slander.

1173
01:20:27,229 --> 01:20:29,729
If you wish to win her
over, put in some effort.

1174
01:20:29,729 --> 01:20:33,029
What does she like, what
is she interested in?

1175
01:20:33,029 --> 01:20:35,100
What could you do to please her?

1176
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:37,440
At least try to figure that out.

1177
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,769
You didn't even give me a chance to try.

1178
01:20:40,069 --> 01:20:43,479
Trying to win that opportunity
is where the work begins.

1179
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:55,090
No one is left now.

1180
01:20:56,319 --> 01:21:02,160
Perhaps there was no one from the very start.

1181
01:21:02,559 --> 01:21:05,700
That's fine. You're 23 years old.

1182
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:09,330
You can try this and that and
every kind of relationship.

1183
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:11,170
You can still bounce back.

1184
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:12,799
It's easy to recover.

1185
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:16,580
But then you could get badly
burned and give up altogether.

1186
01:21:19,479 --> 01:21:22,309
But what's wrong with that? That's life too.

1187
01:21:22,910 --> 01:21:25,580
The whole process is the history of dating.

1188
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:29,249
Is it?

1189
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:31,420
It's okay.

1190
01:21:31,690 --> 01:21:33,759
They say that loving yourself...

1191
01:21:33,759 --> 01:21:35,890
is a romance that lasts a lifetime.

1192
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:39,130
Ditch everything else and love yourself.

1193
01:21:39,229 --> 01:21:42,069
Do you know what your tragedy is?

1194
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,239
You think too much.

1195
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:47,670
You think you're so smart,
you use your brain too much.

1196
01:21:47,769 --> 01:21:51,380
While others think 2 steps ahead,
you think 3, 4 steps ahead.

1197
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:54,910
I don't torture my brain on
purpose. It just works that way.

1198
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:57,450
Anyway, there's a certain timing...

1199
01:21:57,620 --> 01:22:00,549
when you must be especially mindless.

1200
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:02,520
When is that?

1201
01:22:02,989 --> 01:22:04,620
When you're having sex.

1202
01:22:06,359 --> 01:22:08,790
I should be mindless when I'm doing it?

1203
01:22:09,089 --> 01:22:12,629
Sex should be just that. Sex.

1204
01:22:13,930 --> 01:22:15,899
Don't give it any more meaning.

1205
01:22:17,969 --> 01:22:20,540
The moment you crossed
the line with a friend,

1206
01:22:21,310 --> 01:22:24,040
Nam Du Ah got locked up in this fence.

1207
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:28,149
"Can I handle these emotions?"

1208
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:32,680
Your heart puts on the brakes.

1209
01:22:35,390 --> 01:22:36,520
The brakes.

1210
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:41,390
When that man suddenly said he loves you.

1211
01:22:44,430 --> 01:22:46,299
What did you think then?

1212
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:52,439
Everything in life has a timing.

1213
01:22:53,370 --> 01:22:58,439
Timing can bring people together,
but it can also distance people.

1214
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:06,379
I'll write to you every day.

1215
01:23:08,489 --> 01:23:09,549
Okay.

1216
01:23:10,359 --> 01:23:11,859
Take care.

1217
01:23:14,989 --> 01:23:16,029
Okay.

1218
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,330
No.

1219
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,669
I won't write.

1220
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:27,609
Don't join the army.

1221
01:23:29,169 --> 01:23:30,879
If you join the army,

1222
01:23:33,109 --> 01:23:35,549
who am I to eat with,

1223
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,520
watch movies with,

1224
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,350
and hang out with?

1225
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:43,689
I have no friends.

1226
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:47,529
I'll visit you often.

1227
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:49,629
No.

1228
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:53,000
Can you just not go?

1229
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:04,180
We were closer than anyone,

1230
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:06,950
and the best of friends.

1231
01:24:07,109 --> 01:24:09,149
The reason our relationship changed...

1232
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:11,980
was that Han Wool enlisted.

1233
01:24:45,279 --> 01:24:46,450
I love you.

1234
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,480
Just once, before he enlisted,

1235
01:25:13,379 --> 01:25:17,520
That was our first and last time.

1236
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:21,419
I couldn't believe in love.

1237
01:25:23,219 --> 01:25:27,160
Rather than ruin our friendship
with an imperfect affection,

1238
01:25:28,129 --> 01:25:30,460
I thought it was best we remain as friends.

1239
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:34,129
I decided from my own perspective.

1240
01:26:29,689 --> 01:26:31,060
Han Wool.

1241
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:40,730
Let's go inside. Let's talk inside.

1242
01:27:07,330 --> 01:27:08,830
Did you drink?

1243
01:27:10,330 --> 01:27:11,529
With whom?

1244
01:27:12,759 --> 01:27:14,100
Just someone.

1245
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,270
I'm sorry.

1246
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:21,839
For what?

1247
01:27:21,839 --> 01:27:23,609
This wouldn't have happened...

1248
01:27:23,609 --> 01:27:25,379
if I had been more careful with my tablet PC.

1249
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:27,509
I know it's too late,

1250
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:31,080
but I feel like I should apologize.

1251
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:32,680
And?

1252
01:27:34,919 --> 01:27:38,919
I'm also sorry for always apologizing...

1253
01:27:39,489 --> 01:27:41,060
after speaking my mind out loud.

1254
01:27:42,830 --> 01:27:43,930
And?

1255
01:27:46,230 --> 01:27:48,129
I'm also sorry for being
so emotional with you...

1256
01:27:50,939 --> 01:27:53,100
when you were the one
having the hardest time.

1257
01:27:53,270 --> 01:27:54,839
It's okay.

1258
01:27:55,839 --> 01:27:58,140
It's all in the past now.

1259
01:27:58,839 --> 01:28:00,009
But still,

1260
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:03,779
how could you not contact
me for a whole week?

1261
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:06,520
I'm sorry for that too.

1262
01:28:09,919 --> 01:28:11,620
I'd also like to apologize.

1263
01:28:12,359 --> 01:28:14,989
Because you were always so nice to me,

1264
01:28:15,589 --> 01:28:17,799
I let myself cross the line.

1265
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:20,129
I just thought you'd still be there for me...

1266
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:22,799
no matter how mean I was to you.

1267
01:28:24,069 --> 01:28:25,600
I shouldn't have done that.

1268
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,540
No, you were nothing like that.

1269
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:32,480
But Han Wool.

1270
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:35,950
You should be apologizing to me
about something else, you know.

1271
01:28:36,710 --> 01:28:37,779
What?

1272
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:39,980
The day before you went to the army,

1273
01:28:40,950 --> 01:28:44,290
you told me you loved me all of a sudden.

1274
01:28:49,259 --> 01:28:51,560
It's true that I was confused.

1275
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:55,129
When I heard that you were
suddenly going to go to the army,

1276
01:28:55,799 --> 01:28:57,540
I found myself feeling peculiar.

1277
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:00,140
I kept wondering...

1278
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:02,439
why I was feeling that way.

1279
01:29:03,310 --> 01:29:05,080
Especially on the very last day.

1280
01:29:07,609 --> 01:29:10,980
But that's when you suddenly
told me you loved me.

1281
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:19,989
I love you.

1282
01:29:21,790 --> 01:29:23,390
I was flustered.

1283
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:28,430
I couldn't give you an answer,

1284
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:32,270
but you seemed so resolute about it.

1285
01:29:35,469 --> 01:29:37,180
And that's why it scared me.

1286
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:44,180
You know I tend to think too much.

1287
01:29:45,319 --> 01:29:47,689
I don't think I was brave enough...

1288
01:29:48,089 --> 01:29:50,460
to take our relationship to another level.

1289
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:52,790
But...

1290
01:29:53,719 --> 01:29:56,230
after I ran away from you,

1291
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,600
I felt lonely.

1292
01:30:01,330 --> 01:30:04,799
You know you're my only friend.

1293
01:30:08,169 --> 01:30:12,540
After I ran away from my
only friend, schoolmate,

1294
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:15,580
and the only guy...

1295
01:30:16,279 --> 01:30:18,319
I felt a connection with,

1296
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:20,489
I suddenly felt so lost.

1297
01:30:22,589 --> 01:30:24,390
That's why I tried to come up with a way...

1298
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:29,960
to fill your space.

1299
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,600
And that's why you dated those three guys?

1300
01:30:34,270 --> 01:30:36,569
- Yes.
- You're stupid.

1301
01:30:36,899 --> 01:30:39,140
It's impossible to fill my space.

1302
01:30:39,739 --> 01:30:41,169
Whatever.

1303
01:30:48,009 --> 01:30:49,450
Du Ah.

1304
01:30:51,379 --> 01:30:53,049
Then how about now?

1305
01:30:53,319 --> 01:30:54,350
What?

1306
01:30:55,790 --> 01:30:58,160
I'm right here next to you.

1307
01:31:00,189 --> 01:31:03,330
You don't need those guys
to replace me anymore.

1308
01:31:06,859 --> 01:31:08,230
Will you let me...

1309
01:31:10,129 --> 01:31:12,239
stay beside you again?

1310
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:17,480
Han Wool.

1311
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:19,680
Yes?

1312
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:22,779
I think there's an expiry date...

1313
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:26,620
for all relationships.

1314
01:31:28,689 --> 01:31:31,660
You're so precious to me.

1315
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:35,560
I love you and care for you so much.

1316
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:40,500
But I think that's because we're friends.

1317
01:31:40,969 --> 01:31:43,669
We're so perfect as friends.

1318
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:45,500
And I don't...

1319
01:31:47,540 --> 01:31:50,540
want to ruin what we have.

1320
01:31:52,739 --> 01:31:55,180
You think we're perfect as friends?

1321
01:31:58,279 --> 01:32:00,080
Just be honest with me.

1322
01:32:03,419 --> 01:32:05,359
Whether I remain as a
friend or your boyfriend,

1323
01:32:08,529 --> 01:32:10,859
do you feel like you can live without me now?

1324
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:29,810
I should go.

1325
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:46,660
I'm sorry.

1326
01:33:18,529 --> 01:33:20,299
You'll be fine.

1327
01:33:42,319 --> 01:33:43,620
My gosh.

1328
01:35:55,489 --> 01:35:57,350
Friends or lovers.

1329
01:35:57,589 --> 01:35:59,620
Why was I so caught up with the labels...

1330
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:01,689
that determined relationships?

1331
01:36:03,230 --> 01:36:06,330
All the leaves are brown

1332
01:36:07,770 --> 01:36:10,600
And the sky is gray

1333
01:36:11,469 --> 01:36:14,640
I've been for a walk

1334
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:19,009
On a winter's day

1335
01:36:19,839 --> 01:36:22,609
I'd be safe and warm

1336
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:25,580
Come on. Don't spill food when you eat!

1337
01:36:25,819 --> 01:36:27,950
- Brat.
- "Brat"?

1338
01:36:28,350 --> 01:36:29,649
Am I your brat?

1339
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:36,129
I'm turning. Hey, I'm turning.

1340
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:39,160
Buk-boogie. Hey, Buk-boogie.

1341
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:40,759
On me?

1342
01:36:43,029 --> 01:36:45,899
Oh, my! I think it likes me.

1343
01:36:47,069 --> 01:36:48,839
I didn't know how to love him.

1344
01:36:49,239 --> 01:36:51,839
But I realized that if I
wanted him by my side...

1345
01:36:51,839 --> 01:36:54,410
and didn't want to lose him,
I should have been honest.

1346
01:36:56,350 --> 01:37:00,250
I should have been honest
when I needed to be honest.

1347
01:37:02,189 --> 01:37:05,989
And I realized that too late.

1348
01:37:08,390 --> 01:37:10,029
PRESENT

1349
01:37:39,219 --> 01:37:42,290
I'm sure a coincidence will
bring us together again.

1350
01:37:56,910 --> 01:37:58,180
That fool.

1351
01:38:16,230 --> 01:38:18,460
BUK-BOOGIE

1352
01:38:18,460 --> 01:38:19,460
Hey.

1353
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:22,669
All you do is sleep, you know?

1354
01:38:31,410 --> 01:38:32,509
Hello?

1355
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:36,910
Is this Do Han Wool?

1356
01:38:37,549 --> 01:38:38,819
RESTRICTED NUMBER

1357
01:38:40,379 --> 01:38:41,620
Yes, this is he.

1358
01:38:41,620 --> 01:38:43,620
I have a package for you.

1359
01:38:43,620 --> 01:38:44,719
Du Ah.

1360
01:38:58,239 --> 01:39:02,310
BOMB

1361
01:39:03,410 --> 01:39:04,439
"Bomb"?

1362
01:39:06,279 --> 01:39:07,680
This is so typical of Du Ah.

1363
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:15,989
DDO-BOOGIE

1364
01:39:15,989 --> 01:39:17,189
"Ddo-boogie".

1365
01:39:27,770 --> 01:39:31,540
There are no coincidences
in the world, you fool.

1366
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:07,739
Hey, Du Ah.

1367
01:40:12,839 --> 01:40:14,109
Hello.

1368
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:31,930
NUMBER 23 IS OVER!

1369
01:40:33,929 --> 01:40:36,468
LOVE SCENE NUMBER
