1
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,415
Do you believe
that a perfect relationship exists?

2
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,150
To me, relationships
are all about "take and give."

3
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,159
We all have merits of our own,

4
00:00:24,159 --> 00:00:27,024
but that also means
we all have flaws.

5
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:30,159
It's naive to believe that
one can fulfill your every need.

6
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:31,959
I'm not one to ask for much.

7
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:34,925
I only wish for what
that certain person can offer.

8
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,335
That's right.

9
00:00:37,569 --> 00:00:42,005
I'm currently in a relationship
with three guys.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,810
Easy and fun to be around.

11
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,179
It's almost as if he looks up to me.

12
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:52,575
He's the younger guy,
aka Pocket Boy.

13
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,959
Intellectual and mature.

14
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,984
He understands my situation
regardless of what that is.

15
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:04,454
The mature boyfriend.

16
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:11,464
Last but not least...

17
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,365
is the sexy man who knows...

18
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:17,375
what women want.

19
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,475
That makes three.

20
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,410
You may be getting your entire fill
by receiving...

21
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,250
what all three men have to offer,

22
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,815
but the three men are left
to share you among themselves.

23
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,319
How's that fair?

24
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:33,125
It was always the guys
who came up to me first.

25
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,759
- Then...
- You're...

26
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,054
Now...

27
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,925
- My girlfriend.
- My girlfriend.

28
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:41,324
We're each giving each other
what the other person needs,

29
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,065
so I don't see an issue.

30
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,065
Do the men know that others exist?

31
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:51,175
The fact that they don't know
makes this perfect.

32
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:58,044
(Love Scene Number)

33
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,410
What the...

34
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,850
Why are you always here
instead of at your own place?

35
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,375
Well, because your place is cleaner.

36
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:32,245
And better stocked.

37
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,155
Still, you should've told me
that you were coming over.

38
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:39,484
As if it's anything new.

39
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:42,954
- Aussie cheese fries?
- Double the bacon.

40
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:51,595
- Nice!
- Stop.

41
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,505
Humans are supposed to use tools.

42
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,775
Gimbap. That's what I'm craving.

43
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:06,180
Are you kidding me?

44
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,220
Not the kind you buy,
but the kind you make at home.

45
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,659
The homemade gimbap by Do Han Wool.

46
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,954
They're better than drugs.

47
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,155
Gimbap.

48
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,625
Gimbap by Do Han Wool.

49
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:19,454
Forget it.

50
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,924
Gimbap...

51
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,419
What? Why are you throwing a fit?

52
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:43,560
- Give me this.
- Not that one.

53
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,160
- I want it!
- It's a limited edition.

54
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,489
It wasn't easy for me to get that.

55
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:50,530
Choose from the others I have, okay?

56
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,828
Like what?

57
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:54,095
How about I take Buk-boogie instead?

58
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:56,394
What? Of course, you can't.

59
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,664
No can do then.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,634
I'll...

61
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:02,268
just have to steal it.

62
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:05,475
Hey. Wait. Nam Du Ah!

63
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,514
Sorry.

64
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:16,014
Right.

65
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,255
I'll get going then.

66
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,305
Then there's the fourth guy.

67
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:39,534
My friend, Do Han Wool.

68
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,815
(Da Ham)

69
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,625
I bet you miss me.
You can come over.

70
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,654
Right now, of course.

71
00:05:01,499 --> 00:05:04,199
My mom and dad? They went on a trip.

72
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,634
Just know that I won't wait long.

73
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,594
Wash your hands first.

74
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,844
Du Ah, how about
some eclairs for breakfast?

75
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,419
It's 10 a.m.!
Didn't you say you had a class?

76
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:00,789
What? Darn, I'll be late.

77
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:03,055
Your clothes.
Don't forget your clothes!

78
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:11,140
I've never seen these before.

79
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,505
- They're eclairs.
- Nice.

80
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,375
Is it good?

81
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,805
Nothing is better for breakfast
than sweet desserts.

82
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,474
Wait. That reminds me.

83
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,485
I brought the books.

84
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,245
Here.

85
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,384
Gosh. Thank you, Du Ah.
I'll make good use of them.

86
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:36,555
I've written a lot in those though.

87
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:39,558
These aren't just
ordinary books.

88
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:41,669
I asked for these
so that some of your energy...

89
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:43,640
will rub off me
and help me get a good score.

90
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,334
If that's the case, I'll give you
some of my other books too.

91
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,464
Did you know...

92
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,574
that we only get to experience
a limited amount of joy in life?

93
00:06:52,609 --> 00:06:56,204
I wonder if I should be
getting my fill just with you.

94
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,715
He never seems to say
the same flirtatious line twice.

95
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,755
Crafty and creative. Nice.

96
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,655
Du Ah, are you free?

97
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,025
What is it, sir?

98
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,734
This. Would you like to
join my team?

99
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,269
"Society of Clinical Psychology
Symposium".

100
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:23,874
Yes, but it's not just
any symposium...

101
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
I'll take this.

102
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,945
No, I meant we should
participate together. Du Ah.

103
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:30,350
I want to take
the professor's class,

104
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,420
but I don't know what to do...

105
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,284
since I'm only in my second year.

106
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:35,349
If you didn't take
developmental psychology,

107
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,484
you won't be able to take it.

108
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,284
The professor asks each student
when you took that class.

109
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:43,294
It may be difficult to take it.

110
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,895
I took that class last year.

111
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,364
Really?

112
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:51,234
The professor's teaching style
and the exams...

113
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,095
are very similar to that class.

114
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,804
They're very...

115
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:02,775
soft.

116
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,275
What?

117
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:05,515
What?

118
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,385
Well, yes.

119
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,595
(Department of Psychology
Teaching Assistant's Office)

120
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,315
I want to write a dissertation
about polyamory.

121
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:45,854
- What?
- For the symposium.

122
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,024
I'm almost done
with the dissertation plan.

123
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,654
By polyamory, do you mean...

124
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:55,624
The practice of being
in multiple open relationships.

125
00:08:56,429 --> 00:09:00,335
You don't restrict your partner
from having multiple relationships.

126
00:09:00,669 --> 00:09:04,778
A type of relationship
where you maintain relationships...

127
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:06,175
with several partners?

128
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:09,945
You mean...

129
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,719
That's right.

130
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,950
A close friend of yours, a writer,

131
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,445
wrote about it.

132
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,918
An increasing number of people
around the world...

133
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:21,654
are choosing not to get married.

134
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,230
That just proves that
there are flaws...

135
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,624
in the current marriage system.

136
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,524
Times have changed, and that means
people will change as well.

137
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,165
This is the perfect time
to research this.

138
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:36,774
So?

139
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,774
Please introduce me to her.

140
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,974
I want to interview her.

141
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:45,144
("Love Without Ownership")

142
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:53,590
I came here to interview you.

143
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,285
Sure. You can do that.

144
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,894
But first, let me ask you
a few questions.

145
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,994
Ask me?

146
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:04,740
Why did I... No. Why did my book
catch your attention?

147
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,065
I'd like to know that first.

148
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,734
What are you curious about?

149
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,409
After reading my book, this is what
people are the most curious about.

150
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:14,675
"Why did they become polyamorists?"

151
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,549
"How did they date..."

152
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,679
"multiple people at a time
and even get married?"

153
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:21,014
That's what they're curious about.

154
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:23,690
But you can't explain it.

155
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,514
Of course not.
This is just an inclination.

156
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:31,455
It's the same thing as asking why
a guy likes a woman.

157
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,665
Exactly.

158
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,124
It's an inclination.
You're just born with it.

159
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,234
But how they began...

160
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:42,969
and their method of doing it...

161
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,604
are different.

162
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,974
What about you?

163
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:50,545
Me?

164
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:54,519
You're not in
an ordinary relationship, are you?

165
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,685
How is it?

166
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:02,690
You're not going to show this video
to anyone else, are you?

167
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,659
If you're worried,
should I turn this off?

168
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:08,428
Once I'm done,
you'll do the same, right?

169
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:10,364
- Of course.
- Then it's fine.

170
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:17,504
I'm in a perfect relationship.

171
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,404
I beg to differ.

172
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:24,080
Before deciding what kind
of relationship is the most ideal,

173
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,815
you should determine
the sincerity...

174
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,984
Coming. I'm coming.

175
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:38,295
Okay, I'm coming.

176
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,529
This is you, right?
It's you, isn't it?

177
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:42,894
What is this?

178
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,435
This was posted
on our school's online community.

179
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,604
This is your house.

00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:56,805
"of an Extremely Intelligent Student
from Social Science Class of 2017."

182
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,345
"From the outside, she looks like
a perfect, golden child."

183
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,419
"But the truth is,
she's in a messy relationship..."

184
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:06,415
"with three guys..."

185
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,055
"and is deceiving them."

186
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,654
This should be taken seriously.

187
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:14,600
Someone who came to your house
took this photo...

188
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,295
and spread such a ridiculous rumor
about you.

189
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,840
"A week from now,
on the 19th at noon,"

190
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,774
"I'll reveal her identity."

191
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,740
Then there's only six days left.

192
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,049
Let's tell the administrators
to delete this post immediately.

193
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:29,509
What are you talking about?

194
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:31,120
Do you want everyone to know
that it's me?

195
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,919
I can ask them.

196
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,250
Or it could be anonymous.

197
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,289
No.

198
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:38,019
It's useless to ask them
to delete it right now.

199
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:39,289
Then you'll let this be?

200
00:12:39,289 --> 00:12:43,055
It's very unlikely that anyone
will know that this is me.

201
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,029
Deleting this post immediately...

202
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:46,759
will only provoke this individual.

203
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:48,665
By the way,
why are you so nonchalant?

204
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,295
Do you know who took this?

205
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,335
- Perhaps.
- Who is it?

206
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,610
I'll take care of this.
You can go home.

207
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,134
Don't be absurd.

208
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,144
What will you do on your own?

209
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,320
Then what can you do?

210
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,915
I'm the one who found that post.

211
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,715
I'm not leaving
until you explain it to me.

212
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:10,254
Hey.

213
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,265
These are the suspects
who could've taken this photo.

214
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,570
There are three in total.

215
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,680
It steadily grows...

216
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,474
Yeon Sang Woo, a senior of mine
and a graduate student.

217
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,004
Han Si Han, an engineering student,
class of 2018.

218
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,145
Yoo Da Ham, a fourth-year student
from K University.

219
00:13:40,249 --> 00:13:43,614
- They've been here at least once.
- Stop it.

220
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,454
So that post is true?

221
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,324
You were dating three guys at once?

222
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:55,930
- So what?
- How could you be so fearless...

223
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,695
as to bring a guy home
when you're living alone?

224
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,234
Hey, you're a guy too.
And you're here with me.

225
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,874
Are you comparing me with them?

226
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,604
What's so different about you?

227
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,550
Han Wool,

228
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,590
I don't understand why you're
reacting this way. It baffles me.

229
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,214
There are consequences.

230
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,454
Don't you see the consequences?

231
00:14:24,859 --> 00:14:26,359
It all happened because...

232
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:29,795
Are you saying it's because
I was careless?

233
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,869
No. That's not what I meant.

234
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:34,704
Whatever.

235
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,135
I can take care of it.
You really should go home.

236
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,244
Du Ah.

237
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,984
What's your relationship
with those three anyway?

238
00:14:56,259 --> 00:14:58,295
I said, I can take care of it.

239
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:01,670
I'll find out why he did this...

240
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,340
and what he wants first.
Then I can stop him.

241
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,635
I don't care.

242
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,165
Just end your relationship
with all of them right now.

243
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,540
Then he'll reveal
who I am right away...

244
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,139
without waiting for a week.

245
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:15,550
Like I said, he wants me
to recognize myself in the picture.

246
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,775
He wants to see how I'll react.

247
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,979
If I end my relationship
with all three of them...

248
00:15:19,979 --> 00:15:22,185
without even knowing who posted it,

249
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,119
he'll do something
even more provoking...

250
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:26,685
to corner me.

251
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,859
Go home. It's late.

252
00:15:31,859 --> 00:15:34,165
I have to get up early tomorrow.

253
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:51,574
Tell me if you need anything.

254
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:53,645
I'll help you.

255
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:01,655
Okay. I will.

256
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:32,214
A perfect relationship.
A perfect relationship, my foot.

257
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,754
I've been completely fooled.

258
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:43,124
What do I do?

259
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:48,905
Who is it? Who did it?

260
00:16:50,369 --> 00:16:51,675
It's one of the three.

261
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:55,209
Think. Think, Du Ah.

262
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,545
I can find him. There are only
a limited number of suspects.

263
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,484
Who's the most likely?

264
00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:04,489
By analyzing, I can find him.

265
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:06,155
It's one of the three.

266
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,590
Among the three,

267
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:10,355
suspect number one is Yeon Sang Woo.

268
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:25,435
Are you okay? Why are you crying?
Are you not feeling well?

269
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,615
What's wrong?

270
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:44,325
He fell in love with me
the moment he saw me.

271
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:48,865
He's an open-minded grown man
who can accept whatever I say...

272
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:51,365
without prejudice.

273
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,034
He's been at my place twice.

274
00:17:55,209 --> 00:17:57,939
That means he's had two chances
to take the picture.

275
00:17:57,939 --> 00:17:59,439
Can you get my cardigan
from the kitchen?

276
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:00,845
Yes, sure.

277
00:18:02,609 --> 00:18:05,575
I'd say he's had
more than enough chances.

278
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,774
Next,

279
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,314
suspect number two is Han Si Han.

280
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:15,385
Hey, Du Ah.

281
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,925
Yes?

282
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,155
There's something
I want to show you.

283
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,695
Okay. What is it?

284
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:27,534
This is an app I developed.

285
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:29,369
Your name, Du Ah, means love.

286
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:32,879
Whenever anyone in the world
searches for a word that means love,

287
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,445
a heart will pop up.

288
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,814
Do you mean
that's how you feel about me?

289
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,330
He's an innocent, younger guy...

290
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,260
who told me he'd had a crush on me
for two years...

291
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,155
since he entered university.

292
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,095
He's been at my place once.

293
00:18:57,899 --> 00:19:01,435
That means he's had
only one chance to take the picture.

294
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:05,835
But if he really wanted to,
it wouldn't have been impossible.

295
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,209
The last suspect, Yoo Da Ham,

296
00:19:10,209 --> 00:19:12,274
is the only one
who doesn't go to my school.

297
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,675
From the moment we first met,

298
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,014
we were strongly attracted
to each other.

299
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:51,814
He's an immensely sexy man.

300
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,954
He's been at my place...

301
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,699
a lot of times.
Countless times, actually.

302
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:04,734
Therefore, he's had
the most chances...

303
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,135
to take the picture as well.

304
00:20:13,939 --> 00:20:15,379
People behave...

305
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:18,175
more morally in the morning
than in the afternoon.

306
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,919
It's called
the morning morality effect.

307
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,615
That means I have a higher chance
to catch his lie in the morning.

308
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,855
What's up? What are you doing
at my school so early?

309
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,655
Actually, there's been a bit of
an incident at my school lately.

310
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:34,570
A freshman girl broke up
with her boyfriend,

311
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,129
and he spread
her personal pictures...

312
00:20:37,129 --> 00:20:39,435
all over social media.

313
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,510
In the end, the cops showed up
and everything.

314
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,304
- The cops?
- Yes.

315
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:45,280
Apparently, the girl made a report.

316
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,980
The guy should have just accepted
the breakup and dealt with it.

317
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,679
The thing is, she turned out
to have been two-timing him.

318
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:54,449
That's not an excuse.

319
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:56,385
What she did is wrong,

320
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,155
but he shouldn't have
reacted that way.

321
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,655
Has that been troubling you?

322
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:03,554
Yes.

323
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:06,825
I'll see you soon.

324
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,024
See you.

325
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,865
Da Ham.

326
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:13,794
Yes?

327
00:21:14,209 --> 00:21:15,835
Do you want to come over later?

328
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,744
Wait!

329
00:21:25,219 --> 00:21:26,875
Gosh, I'm sorry.

330
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,779
- I shouldn't drink alcohol.
- What?

331
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,415
I'll lose muscle mass.

332
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,814
This is my mom's favorite bottle.

333
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,419
You haven't had any alcohol
in a while, so it'll be fine.

334
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:08,530
- Cheers.
- Okay.

335
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,885
Let's do a love shot.

336
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:13,129
- Bottoms up.
- The entire glass?

337
00:22:13,129 --> 00:22:14,264
Yes.

338
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,135
Gosh, you're amazing.

339
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,935
Incredible.

340
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:50,665
What is this?

341
00:22:55,369 --> 00:22:57,239
October 12, Monday.

342
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,804
- This is my house.
- Morning body check.

343
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,044
Hi, Da Ham.

344
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:03,105
I love you.

345
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,645
Who is it?

346
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,544
Gosh, why is he...

347
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,199
What are you doing here?

348
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,425
Someone's in there, right?

349
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,895
I said I'd take care of it.

350
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,635
Is he one of those three guys?

351
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,740
I should find out who it is.

352
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,540
Is that important right now?

353
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,135
If he's the one who posted that,

354
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:36,544
you could be in danger right now.

355
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:40,314
- Hey.
- He's a neighbor.

356
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:46,754
He's a neighbor from downstairs.

357
00:23:46,889 --> 00:23:48,754
I think we were a bit loud.

358
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,464
We were loud?

359
00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:03,405
I'm sorry for causing a ruckus
at such a late hour.

360
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,105
I should go home.

361
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,804
- I'll call you. Goodnight.
- Okay.

362
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,514
Bye.

364
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,464
What do you think will happen
if you get involved?

365
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:39,580
That'll be even more dangerous
since you'll be provoking him.

366
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,175
Why aren't you asking them
right away?

367
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:46,175
I told you.

368
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,990
They wouldn't confess that way.

369
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,260
Are you sure it's not because
you don't want to admit...

370
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,214
that you were betrayed by
those guys you looked down on?

371
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,885
What do you know about me
to say such things?

372
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,024
Do you know...

373
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:01,925
what I'm thinking?

374
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,764
You're right.

375
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,204
What do I know?

376
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,504
Don't skip your meals.

377
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,645
Okay.

378
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,175
Come to the elevator right now.

379
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,835
A plaid shirt?

380
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:58,175
Du Ah.

381
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,474
Hi.

382
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,314
What brings you to my house?

383
00:27:07,389 --> 00:27:09,254
I've always wanted to visit.

384
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:11,024
Here you go.

385
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:13,625
Du Ah...

386
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:17,070
Goodness, I forgot to buy beverages.

387
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:20,938
I'm totally parched.
Could you buy me some beverages?

388
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,309
Okay.

389
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,678
- Right now.
- Okay. I won't take long.

390
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:25,835
Okay.

391
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,135
It's not in the gallery.

392
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,804
"DA"?

393
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,145
"Du Ah"?

394
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,974
Is it me?

395
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:08,385
What?

396
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:12,655
Why did he screenshot
all my photos from my social media?

397
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,524
Right, the plaid shirt.

398
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:17,954
The plaid shirt...

399
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:30,405
No, these are different.

400
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,075
These aren't it.

401
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,714
What the...

402
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,689
(Lovely Si Han, I miss you so much.)

403
00:28:47,689 --> 00:28:48,925
A Ra?

404
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,964
(Si Han, I hope you like it.)

405
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,195
Ji Min?

406
00:28:57,969 --> 00:28:59,070
(Si Han, it's the belt you wanted!)

407
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,165
Su Jin?

408
00:29:05,939 --> 00:29:07,375
Are these all...

409
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:10,304
Gosh.

410
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:15,415
I got us some beverages.

411
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,714
What did you get?

412
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:22,054
Actually, these should
be set to the side.

413
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,734
Don't. Don't!

414
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,605
I'm not interested
in doing this with you.

415
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,415
Du Ah, I'm sorry.

416
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,089
I must've been insane just now.

417
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:51,085
This isn't who I am.

418
00:29:51,219 --> 00:29:52,814
I hope you don't...

419
00:29:52,889 --> 00:29:54,514
I'll...

420
00:29:55,189 --> 00:29:57,185
Du Ah, I didn't mean it.

421
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,774
Yes, Professor. I'll be right there.
Just a moment.

422
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,494
(Photos)

423
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,260
(This folder is empty.)

424
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,425
Why has the cloud been wiped clean?

425
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:38,964
This is where Sang Woo
saves his photos.

426
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:41,905
Did he delete them on purpose?

427
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:43,835
What the...

428
00:30:48,109 --> 00:30:51,415
Oh, hey. Is Sang Woo not here?

429
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,090
Yes, it seems like
he stepped out for a moment.

430
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,290
Did you have an appointment?

431
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,685
Oh, I must be here early.

432
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:01,054
I guess he'll be here.

433
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,835
He'll soon be here, right?

434
00:31:16,469 --> 00:31:17,905
Anyway, take care.

435
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,375
Sure thing. I'll see you around.

436
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,980
No, it's fine. It's no big deal.

437
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,850
I found her intriguing.

438
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,284
- Du Ah?
- Yes.

439
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:32,314
I get this from students these days.

440
00:31:32,459 --> 00:31:34,320
They have strong egos...

441
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,984
but nothing of substance.
Du Ah's like that too.

442
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:38,560
She thinks that what she learned...

443
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,928
is the way of the universe
and wants to apply...

444
00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:42,695
technological terms
and theories everywhere.

445
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:45,734
I guess I know the type.

446
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,405
It's adorable,

447
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:52,540
but her thoughts
are still quite young.

448
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,544
She believes she has
great insight on things,

449
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,075
so who am I to burst her bubble?

450
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:00,575
Kids her age are all like that.

451
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,260
- Su Min.
- Yes?

452
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,115
- Did you see the post?
- Which one?

453
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:09,685
The three-timing girl from
Social Science Class of 2017.

454
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:12,060
No way. Who is it though?

455
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,030
I don't know,
but aren't her legs to die for?

456
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,399
No wonder she's able
to date three guys at once.

457
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:18,600
Did a peeping Tom take this?

458
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,039
- Beats me.
- Is there more about her?

459
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,109
I think I have an idea
of who it is though.

460
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:24,734
Who?

461
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,845
Du Ah?

462
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,454
Sorry.

463
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:41,984
What's that?

464
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:47,454
You see, I suddenly
had this wild thought.

465
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,494
"Could that be the only photo
which was taken of me?"

466
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:55,564
Perhaps, did he try to get
more photos of me and...

467
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,240
Are you talking about your house?

468
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,875
Yes. A device could've been set up.

469
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,175
It's why I bought this gadget.

470
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:07,175
Can this small device
help you locate anything?

471
00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:11,685
It detects electromagnetic waves.

472
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,385
So if there's a camera in there,

473
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:15,885
a light will bounce off of it...

474
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:19,024
no matter how small the camera is.

475
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,024
Have you checked?
Have you given it a try?

476
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:24,564
No.

477
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:28,234
I was too scared to go inside.

478
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:32,635
It terrifies me to think
that a device could be in there.

479
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,445
It's why I can't
get myself to go in.

480
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,014
Give me that.

481
00:33:40,449 --> 00:33:44,085
I'll do it instead.
I'll see if there are any cameras.

482
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:49,254
No, wait. I'll come with you.

483
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:51,855
I want to.

484
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,954
Come on.

485
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:35,104
Wait. What was that?

486
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:40,535
Nothing's there.

487
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,115
How did things get this far?

488
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:54,314
I'm just glad nothing is here.

489
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:57,854
So how did it go...

490
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,995
with your search?

491
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:02,294
Don't ask. It's so annoying.

492
00:35:02,299 --> 00:35:05,595
Tell me what's going on.
You're running out of time anyway.

493
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:09,705
What is it that you want to hear?

494
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,035
Anything.

495
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:14,234
Why though?

496
00:35:14,909 --> 00:35:16,774
So that you can laugh at me?

497
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,075
Fine, we'll laugh together.

498
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:24,249
You asked me
why I didn't confront them...

499
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,015
even though I knew
it was one of the three, right?

500
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:28,759
Yes, you're right.

501
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:31,285
I didn't want to admit that
I was wrong.

502
00:35:31,489 --> 00:35:32,655
But...

503
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,330
do you know what's hilarious?

504
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,325
I've been completely fooled.

505
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:41,805
I thought that I was in control...

506
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:45,475
and that I had all three of them
perfectly under control.

507
00:35:45,779 --> 00:35:49,575
Far from it.
They were fooling me the whole time.

508
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,544
All of them.

509
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,714
All three of them.

510
00:35:55,889 --> 00:35:57,750
I thought that the younger guy...

511
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,285
had been head over heels
for me for years.

512
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,989
In reality, he was a psycho...

513
00:36:01,989 --> 00:36:05,155
who uses women who like him
as ATMs.

514
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,900
Are these all...

515
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,900
I believed that the old guy...

516
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,164
was generous enough
to embrace all my weaknesses.

517
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,604
But her thoughts
are still quite young.

518
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:17,865
Sure, I'll introduce you to her.
We're close.

519
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:21,949
While pretending to be easy-going,
he talks behind his girl's back.

520
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:23,675
Such a mean pervert.

521
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:34,555
The other guy, the good-looking one,

522
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:39,529
turns out to be a huge narcissist...

523
00:36:39,529 --> 00:36:41,155
who loves no one but himself.

524
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:44,664
It's not me that he wanted.

525
00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:47,600
He was just intoxicated
by himself...

526
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,905
having sex with
an attractive, smart girl like me.

527
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,339
While I thought the three of them
make one perfect man,

528
00:36:52,339 --> 00:36:55,544
all three of them
turn out to be trash!

529
00:36:57,179 --> 00:36:58,515
Trash?

530
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,414
Aren't you the one...

531
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:02,914
who fooled them first?

532
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:05,615
There was no trust there
to begin with.

533
00:37:06,819 --> 00:37:08,684
What were you expecting?

534
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:12,199
All of those guys wanted me first.

535
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:14,330
I gave them
as much as they wanted...

536
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,064
and expected to get
just as much in return.

537
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,699
Is this some kind of deal?

538
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:20,540
Dating is a relationship
between two people.

539
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:24,040
It's important that partners benefit
equally from the relationship.

540
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,710
That's the value of dating.

541
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,234
"Benefit"?

542
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,580
Who cares about that when dating?

543
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,718
Are you sure...

544
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:34,345
you're not the one with prejudice
or fantasies about dating?

545
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:37,549
Emotional stability, a bond,

546
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:41,159
comfort, admiration,
fun, and sexual satisfaction.

547
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,555
Those are the benefits.

548
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,659
I wanted all of that,

549
00:37:44,659 --> 00:37:47,695
but no one man could give me those.
That's why I dated more than one.

550
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,765
Is that so wrong?

551
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:53,369
I worked hard to get what I want.

552
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:55,305
Was that for your partners?

553
00:37:56,409 --> 00:37:57,765
Or for yourself?

554
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:05,914
Du Ah, dating is not research.

555
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:08,819
You do it with your heart,
not your head.

556
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:12,219
So? Are you saying I was wrong...

557
00:38:12,219 --> 00:38:14,714
and deserved what happened?

558
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,024
No.

559
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,655
I feel sorry for you.

560
00:38:19,759 --> 00:38:20,955
Did you break up with me...

561
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,695
to live like this?

562
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:30,135
- Han Wool.
- You must be tired. I'll be going.

563
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:32,874
Wait.

564
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:50,624
(Did you guys see this
on the forum?)

565
00:38:50,759 --> 00:38:52,155
(Video of the three-timing girl
at S University)

566
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,865
(S University's online community
is blowing up about this girl.)

567
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,040
- What a horrible person.
- Disgusting.

568
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,809
- It's sick.
- I hate people like that.

569
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,509
- I heard she's in our department.
- I feel sorry for the guys.

570
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:04,509
I'm scared my girlfriend
might be like her.

571
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,440
- What a disgrace to our school.
- You should die.

572
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,480
How awful.

573
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,144
- I loathe people like her.
- I hope she dies.

574
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,035
What's wrong?

575
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,274
Come in.

576
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:35,015
- Do you feel okay now?
- Yes.

577
00:41:35,929 --> 00:41:40,524
So? Did you check
what made the alarm go off?

578
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,265
No.

579
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:44,124
I was too scared.

580
00:41:44,299 --> 00:41:47,294
I'll go check. Wait here.

581
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:31,365
No, don't...

582
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:44,745
Oh, I'm at Han Wool's.

583
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,754
Why on earth
did I sleep here last night?

584
00:43:49,659 --> 00:43:51,825
Right, now I remember.

585
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:59,064
Han Wool?

586
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:01,564
Do Han Wool?

587
00:44:02,969 --> 00:44:04,434
Maybe he went
to the convenience store.

588
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:07,739
(Buk-boogie)

589
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:08,834
Hey.

590
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,549
Where's your dad?

591
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:13,714
(Buk-boogie)

592
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:23,285
Is this password-protected?

593
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:32,164
Yes, I knew it.

594
00:44:32,799 --> 00:44:36,164
It's not like
he has anything to hide.

595
00:44:37,069 --> 00:44:39,475
What's with all these photos?

596
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,084
Why does he have this?

597
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,155
Could this be the original?

598
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:06,434
What...

599
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,675
Hold on.

600
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:38,624
Do Han Wool...

601
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:52,644
Where is it?

602
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:57,245
It's not here. Why isn't it here?

603
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,955
It's not in his closet!

604
00:46:51,339 --> 00:46:53,075
Why?

605
00:46:56,549 --> 00:46:58,044
Where are you right now?

606
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:01,475
(Where are you right now?)

607
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,785
(Currently online)

608
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:05,345
Han Si Han?

609
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,798
I have something to say...

610
00:47:21,799 --> 00:47:23,434
regarding the online post
associated with this photo.

611
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:25,734
Meet me at 11 a.m. tomorrow...

612
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,575
under the big tree at Changrim Park.

613
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:33,144
(Where are you right now?)

614
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:57,984
Well,

615
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,495
is this direct message true?

616
00:48:00,759 --> 00:48:02,869
Is Du Ah really the girl
that's dating...

617
00:48:02,869 --> 00:48:04,124
three guys at once?

618
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:05,634
I didn't send the message.

619
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,634
Gosh. I'm not getting any replies.

620
00:48:24,789 --> 00:48:25,915
Yes.

621
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:32,394
I also think we'd be better off
just as friends.

622
00:48:33,729 --> 00:48:35,899
If we start dating each other,
we might fight and break up.

623
00:48:35,899 --> 00:48:37,324
And I don't like that.

624
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:42,134
Let's just continue to be friends
like we have been all this time.

625
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:44,604
I'm okay.

626
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:55,414
Love and hatred.

627
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:00,114
When love meets a sense of betrayal,

628
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,084
it turns into resentment.

629
00:49:12,569 --> 00:49:17,209
So Du Ah admitted that
she was seeing the three of us.

630
00:49:17,209 --> 00:49:20,575
And she thinks one of us
wrote that post?

631
00:49:20,939 --> 00:49:22,180
That's it. Right?

632
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,309
Yes.

633
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:24,409
Based on what?

634
00:49:24,409 --> 00:49:26,515
It has to be one of you guys...

635
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,414
because the person who posted that
has recently been inside her house.

636
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:32,459
Where are you going?

637
00:49:32,459 --> 00:49:34,760
I don't understand
why I should stay.

638
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,129
I see. So it was you?

639
00:49:36,129 --> 00:49:38,325
Don't talk nonsense.
I just found out about it.

640
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,700
- You know what?
- Get your hands off me.

641
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,394
- Hey.
- Just sit down.

642
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,568
Tell me the truth. You three had
no idea about that post?

643
00:49:50,569 --> 00:49:51,980
Of course, not!

644
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:54,680
An online community forum?
Who does that? It's so petty.

645
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,150
Fine. Let's say
one of us found out.

646
00:49:57,150 --> 00:50:00,020
Why would anyone post that there?
It's like disgracing yourself.

647
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:01,719
You might not know this
because you're young.

648
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:04,050
If you post anything on that forum,
it only takes seconds...

649
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:05,789
for everyone at school to find out.

650
00:50:05,789 --> 00:50:08,189
Right. Why would we post
something like that?

651
00:50:08,189 --> 00:50:09,984
- Do you have evidence?
- First,

652
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:12,155
let's check the facts.

653
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,294
What's your relationship with her?

654
00:50:18,069 --> 00:50:19,694
My relationship with her?

655
00:50:20,069 --> 00:50:21,194
Well...

656
00:50:22,009 --> 00:50:23,405
Let's do it by a show of hands.

657
00:50:24,669 --> 00:50:27,240
Raise your hand
if you held her hand.

658
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,509
My goodness.
We're not some five-year-olds.

659
00:50:29,509 --> 00:50:30,745
What is this?

660
00:50:35,689 --> 00:50:36,784
Darn it.

661
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,555
First base, anyone?

662
00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:47,895
Beyond first base?

663
00:51:06,379 --> 00:51:07,645
Did you sleep with her?

664
00:51:07,919 --> 00:51:09,115
You didn't?

665
00:51:10,689 --> 00:51:11,854
Hey!

666
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,960
What did you just say?

667
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:16,889
"Hey"? How dare you talk to me
like that? You jerk.

668
00:51:16,889 --> 00:51:18,800
There are some things
you should just keep to yourself.

669
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,930
Gosh. Do you want to
duke it out, pretty boy?

670
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:23,499
- Gosh. Do you think you can fight?
- You jerk!

671
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,939
- Come here. Fine. Let's do it.
- Sure. Go ahead.

672
00:51:25,939 --> 00:51:27,134
- How many times?
- Gosh.

673
00:51:27,969 --> 00:51:29,134
How many times did you do it?

674
00:51:29,409 --> 00:51:31,634
- Gosh.
- Why does that matter now?

675
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:34,810
Wait a minute. Yes, it does matter.

676
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:36,710
You only kissed her a few times.
That's not a serious relationship.

677
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:37,979
I don't think she was serious
with you two. Aren't I right?

678
00:51:37,979 --> 00:51:39,219
Hey.

679
00:51:39,219 --> 00:51:40,620
What about you? Having sex doesn't
mean it was a serious relationship.

680
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:41,990
You were just friends with benefits.

681
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:43,120
- What? Friends with benefits?
- Hey.

682
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,319
- Hey.
- Were you there?

683
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:45,490
How do you know
it wasn't more than just sex?

684
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:46,819
- Hey, were you there?
- He's guilty.

685
00:51:46,819 --> 00:51:48,120
He's overreacting
because he's guilty.

686
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,090
He was just some warm body
she had sex with.

687
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:51,859
She didn't see him as a real...

688
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,629
Hey, what are you doing?

689
00:51:53,629 --> 00:51:55,495
- Stop that.
- Stay out of it.

690
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:56,995
Come on.

691
00:51:57,199 --> 00:51:58,335
Geez.

692
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,400
- Hey, let go of me.
- Hey.

693
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,764
- Hey!
- You, come here.

694
00:52:07,779 --> 00:52:09,005
Gosh.

695
00:52:26,399 --> 00:52:28,424
To me, Du Ah was...

696
00:52:29,269 --> 00:52:31,934
a woman who had so much respect
from me before my girlfriend.

697
00:52:33,069 --> 00:52:34,765
And we were perfect for each other.

698
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,839
We had the same styles, habits,
palate, and everything.

699
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:38,705
We saw eye to eye on everything.

700
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:42,405
I was a year younger than her,
but she always respected me.

701
00:52:42,649 --> 00:52:43,874
Same here.

702
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:49,449
I didn't feel any age gap with her.

703
00:52:49,449 --> 00:52:51,645
We were truly equal
in our relationship.

704
00:52:51,819 --> 00:52:55,924
Since I wanted a serious
long-term relationship with her,

705
00:52:56,759 --> 00:52:59,124
I didn't sleep with her right away.

706
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:05,635
Waiting has nothing to do with
cherishing her.

707
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:09,934
If you love someone, don't you want
to touch her and make love to her?

708
00:53:14,209 --> 00:53:15,575
(Du Ah)

709
00:53:17,879 --> 00:53:19,645
Hey, stop crying.

710
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:27,815
Du Ah.

711
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:50,374
Who on earth are you?

712
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:52,549
What?

713
00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:55,319
No matter how hard I tried to think,
or understand what you did,

714
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:56,544
I don't get it.

715
00:53:57,350 --> 00:53:58,854
Why did you do it?

716
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,455
It was you of all people.

717
00:54:02,959 --> 00:54:04,759
Why did you post my photos...

718
00:54:04,759 --> 00:54:06,655
and write something like that
on that forum?

719
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,765
Please make me understand
why you did it.

720
00:54:11,069 --> 00:54:12,170
Calm down. And say that again.

721
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:14,765
What are you talking about?
Do you think I posted it?

722
00:54:19,709 --> 00:54:21,974
That's my tablet PC.

723
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,275
Check what's in the gallery
on your tablet PC.

724
00:54:35,829 --> 00:54:36,984
These photos...

725
00:54:38,459 --> 00:54:40,155
Why are they in my tablet PC?

726
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:42,164
Are you asking me that?

727
00:54:43,629 --> 00:54:45,335
I really didn't know
why these photos...

728
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,434
Hold on.

729
00:54:56,449 --> 00:54:57,645
No.

730
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,919
No. This is a misunderstanding.

731
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,315
I really didn't know about this.

732
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,220
I think the photos
I have in my phone...

733
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:07,085
got synced to my tablet PC.

734
00:55:07,589 --> 00:55:09,054
Why did you do it?

735
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:11,755
Why are you asking me that?

736
00:55:12,459 --> 00:55:14,124
There's no way
I would do something like that.

737
00:55:15,569 --> 00:55:17,000
I'm telling the truth. Listen.

738
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,434
I just found out that
I had these photos in my phone.

739
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,494
I found out because
you pointed it out.

740
00:55:21,639 --> 00:55:23,170
You know that
I sometimes take photos...

741
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:24,804
because I accidentally
tap the wrong buttons.

742
00:55:25,639 --> 00:55:27,809
Then, where were you just now?

743
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:29,005
Just now?

744
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:33,575
I was with them just now.

745
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:36,290
The three guys you were dating.

746
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:38,220
Why would you meet those three?

747
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:40,215
There's not much time left.

748
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:42,955
- We must sort this out.
- Without telling me?

749
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:46,095
You wouldn't have told me
if I hadn't asked, would you?

750
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,994
You're doing this...

751
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:51,329
and you want me to trust you?

752
00:55:51,329 --> 00:55:54,240
I didn't tell you first
in case you get the wrong idea.

753
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,009
When I figured out
which of them did this,

754
00:55:56,009 --> 00:55:57,639
I was going to tell you then.

755
00:55:57,639 --> 00:55:59,905
So which of the three was it?

756
00:56:01,879 --> 00:56:03,174
I don't know.

757
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:12,114
Maybe finding the culprit
wasn't your goal at all.

758
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:15,325
Not only did you make that post,

759
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,860
but you wanted to...

760
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:19,994
meet the three guys
and ruin my messy relationships.

761
00:56:20,959 --> 00:56:22,525
What are you saying?

762
00:56:23,799 --> 00:56:26,535
- Why would I do that?
- Because you hate me.

763
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,705
Because you think...

764
00:56:29,769 --> 00:56:33,075
I ignore your feelings
and do as I please.

765
00:56:34,139 --> 00:56:36,404
You think I hate you,

766
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:41,750
so I want to ruin
your relationships with those guys?

767
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:44,315
Wasn't that the reason you
wrote that post in the first place?

768
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:56,325
Yes. It's true that I resent you.

769
00:56:58,429 --> 00:57:00,335
How could you do this to me?

770
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:04,965
I asked if you broke up with me
just to do this.

771
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,104
I was serious.

772
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,750
When this happened,

773
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:13,045
you first suspected
those three guys.

774
00:57:13,879 --> 00:57:16,644
You nonchalantly dated
three guys at the same time,

775
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:19,555
and suspected them
as soon as something happened.

776
00:57:20,519 --> 00:57:23,585
I resented you for leaving me
just to do something like this.

777
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,354
Are you done talking?

778
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,269
What makes you so special?

779
00:57:29,269 --> 00:57:30,825
I'm not special.

780
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,234
That's why you dumped me.

781
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:36,465
You did the right thing.

782
00:57:36,669 --> 00:57:39,234
I'm actually
a really selfish piece of trash.

783
00:57:39,279 --> 00:57:42,274
I wished that
you'd suffer as much as I did,

784
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:44,904
and when I saw what happened to you
after what you did...

785
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:47,114
Yes.

786
00:57:48,519 --> 00:57:50,085
You had it coming.

787
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:51,614
That darn post.

788
00:57:52,289 --> 00:57:54,455
It should've been me who wrote it!

789
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:02,825
Do Han Wool!

790
00:58:09,269 --> 00:58:10,465
Excuse me.

791
00:58:11,539 --> 00:58:12,734
Excuse me.

792
00:58:14,879 --> 00:58:17,805
Wasn't that Do Han Wool guy
a bit suspicious?

793
00:58:18,179 --> 00:58:20,220
Could he be the one
who wrote the post?

794
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:23,049
- I thought so too.
- Isn't he actually...

795
00:58:23,049 --> 00:58:26,014
the one who knows most about Du Ah?

796
00:58:26,289 --> 00:58:28,315
He's obviously
the most likely suspect.

797
00:58:28,419 --> 00:58:30,555
It's possible that all this...

798
00:58:30,789 --> 00:58:34,994
was Do Han Wool's big picture.

799
00:58:35,269 --> 00:58:37,230
- What big picture?
- Let's say that...

800
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:39,440
- he has feelings for Du Ah.
- Yes.

801
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,535
And he found out that
she's dating three guys.

802
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:44,705
- Yes.
- How would you ruin that?

803
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,274
You're right.

804
00:58:49,009 --> 00:58:50,545
We shouldn't just
sit back and watch.

805
00:58:51,049 --> 00:58:53,514
The three of us
should get together for a chat.

806
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:54,950
Sure.

807
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:57,220
What's his name? Sang Woo?

808
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:58,754
Where'd he go?

809
00:59:00,289 --> 00:59:01,715
He's over there.

810
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:03,624
What are you doing?

811
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,224
Is that alcohol? My gosh.

812
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,994
Give me that.

813
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,570
Let's have a real drink. It's okay.

814
00:59:12,570 --> 00:59:14,394
Let's go and have our chat.

815
00:59:32,019 --> 00:59:35,285
I resented you for leaving me
just to do something like this.

816
00:59:35,559 --> 00:59:37,330
I'm not special.

817
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:39,224
That's why you dumped me.

818
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:44,595
What a jerk.

819
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:52,734
What's going on?

820
01:00:05,419 --> 01:00:07,215
We are victims.

821
01:00:07,759 --> 01:00:10,759
We're bleeding a gruesome amount.

822
01:00:10,759 --> 01:00:12,524
We're victims.

823
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,624
Yes.

824
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,264
How could she do this to us?

825
01:00:24,409 --> 01:00:26,874
Why are you crying again?

826
01:00:28,779 --> 01:00:30,305
That's enough!

827
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,144
Yes. Let's get together.

828
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:37,415
We must think of
our pride now at least.

829
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:40,419
None of us are to see
Nam Du Ah again.

830
01:00:40,419 --> 01:00:42,019
- Yes!
- Let's do that.

831
01:00:42,019 --> 01:00:44,889
Let's ditch her. Delete her number.
Delete her number.

832
01:00:44,889 --> 01:00:47,399
Don't call her.
And don't take her calls.

833
01:00:47,399 --> 01:00:49,070
- Delete it.
- Delete it.

834
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:50,799
I deleted it!

835
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:52,870
- You deleted it!
- You deleted it.

836
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:55,039
Let's cheer each other on.

837
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:56,269
1, 2, 3.

838
01:00:56,269 --> 01:00:58,710
- Let's do this!
- Let's do this!

839
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:00,404
- Let's have a drink.
- What's this?

840
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:05,715
(Du Ah)

841
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:12,815
Don't do it.

842
01:01:13,019 --> 01:01:14,315
(Du Ah)

843
01:01:15,629 --> 01:01:17,425
(Du Ah)

844
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:21,095
Of course, I won't take it.

845
01:01:21,399 --> 01:01:23,524
- I'm a man.
- Yes, you are.

846
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:25,764
(Du Ah)

847
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:37,950
Am I your second choice
or something?

848
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:39,514
Forget it.

849
01:01:47,559 --> 01:01:48,955
It's an alarm.

850
01:01:51,659 --> 01:01:53,230
Should we order more alcohol?

851
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:55,399
- Ma'am!
- Hold back.

852
01:01:55,399 --> 01:01:59,165
Come on. Let's not do this.

853
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:02,965
We should not let Du Ah control us!

854
01:02:06,379 --> 01:02:09,075
We can't go down like this.

855
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:21,114
Why won't anyone pick up?

856
01:02:24,789 --> 01:02:27,654
Now I can't find out who posted it.

857
01:02:29,899 --> 01:02:32,195
I have just one day left.

(The double life of
a class 2021 history major)

859
01:02:40,539 --> 01:02:44,144
No. Don't give up.

860
01:02:45,009 --> 01:02:47,345
Like Do Han Wool said,

861
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,845
I should contact
the forum moderator.

862
01:02:53,590 --> 01:02:55,215
I'm hungry.

863
01:02:56,289 --> 01:02:58,484
I didn't eat anything all day.

01:03:16,409 --> 01:03:18,004
What a jerk.

866
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,315
Why do you always look at my
tablet PC without my permission?

867
01:03:21,679 --> 01:03:22,820
It's mine, you know.

868
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:27,220
You never keep it locked,
and you always put it wherever.

869
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,325
So I kind of thought of it as mine.

870
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:34,624
That's right. Han Wool never
locked his tablet PC.

871
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:46,504
What if someone knew it was his,

872
01:03:46,509 --> 01:03:50,575
found my photo in there
either by coincidence or on purpose,

873
01:03:52,649 --> 01:03:56,144
and sent it to his or her
cell phone?

874
01:03:59,559 --> 01:04:00,654
(Accept)

875
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:05,524
Yes, that's totally plausible.

01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:16,234
Why didn't I think of this?

878
01:04:21,179 --> 01:04:23,950
- Du Ah.
- Let me see your tablet PC.

879
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:25,404
What? Okay.

880
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:29,384
Where's the photo?

881
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:35,484
October 8, 4 p.m.

882
01:04:36,259 --> 01:04:37,884
Yes, my memory was right.

883
01:04:38,590 --> 01:04:41,394
- Hey, hurry up.
- I'm out.

884
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,929
The day Han Wool came over
to my house.

885
01:04:43,929 --> 01:04:45,935
- Let me go to the bathroom.
- My gosh, come on.

886
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,205
Then it happened four days
after that day.

887
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:53,879
Did you show your tablet PC
to anyone...

888
01:04:53,879 --> 01:04:55,809
between October 9
and October 12, 7 p.m.?

889
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:57,505
Did anyone look through
your tablet PC?

890
01:04:58,210 --> 01:04:59,345
Wait a second.

891
01:05:00,349 --> 01:05:03,390
Did you take it to school
or leave it anywhere?

892
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:04,549
Think about it carefully.

893
01:05:04,549 --> 01:05:06,420
I know you had it with you
over the weekend.

894
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:07,755
Friday. What about on Friday?

895
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:10,325
I only had one class, but it got
canceled, so I stayed home.

896
01:05:10,359 --> 01:05:11,359
What about Monday?

897
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:13,825
I went to school that day
because I had a team meeting.

898
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:15,964
Did you go somewhere
without your tablet PC...

899
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,525
during the team meeting?

900
01:05:21,099 --> 01:05:23,769
Think about it carefully.
That's when it happened.

901
01:05:23,769 --> 01:05:26,874
That's the only time anyone could've
stolen that photo from you.

902
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:30,805
I remember going to the bathroom
with Jun Su.

903
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:33,475
And you didn't take
your tablet PC with you?

904
01:05:35,049 --> 01:05:36,214
No.

905
01:05:36,549 --> 01:05:39,384
How many people were on your team?

906
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:41,684
Three in total including myself.

907
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:45,325
Lee Ju Yeon?

908
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,154
What did you say?

909
01:05:47,259 --> 01:05:48,829
But what are you going to do
after you find out?

910
01:05:48,829 --> 01:05:51,200
Just tell me.
I'll deal with it on my own.

911
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,599
It might not be her.

912
01:05:52,599 --> 01:05:54,099
And even if it is,
don't deal with it on your own.

913
01:05:54,099 --> 01:05:55,394
Han Wool.

914
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:58,565
Lee Ju Yeon.

915
01:05:59,609 --> 01:06:00,735
She studies the same major as you.

916
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,444
Same major as me?

917
01:06:11,950 --> 01:06:13,154
I'm off now.

918
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:17,654
Du Ah.

919
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:21,525
About what I said earlier...

920
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:27,795
I was a bit too harsh.

921
01:06:28,869 --> 01:06:29,964
I'm sorry.

922
01:06:33,609 --> 01:06:35,305
Was it all a lie?

923
01:06:37,049 --> 01:06:40,674
You meant every word you said,
so you don't need to be sorry.

924
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:06,874
I'm so honored
that I got to interview you.

925
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:08,940
I'm a huge fan.

926
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:11,250
I really loved the lecture
you did last time.

927
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:13,849
Another student was supposed
to interview me,

928
01:07:13,849 --> 01:07:16,644
but she suddenly had to deal
with a personal problem.

929
01:07:16,690 --> 01:07:18,985
By any chance,
are you talking about Nam Du Ah?

930
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:21,460
Oh, right. You guys study
the same major.

931
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:23,825
Did something happen to her?

932
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:26,295
I can't tell you specifically.

933
01:07:27,029 --> 01:07:29,700
But I heard she's getting ready
to sue someone...

934
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:31,424
because that person uploaded
her personal life online.

935
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:35,664
Did someone say
something false about her?

936
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:39,335
Well, I wouldn't say it was
completely false.

937
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:44,444
But even if it's true, she can still
sue that person for defamation.

938
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:48,944
She shouldn't have done anything
to get her in that position.

939
01:07:49,079 --> 01:07:51,849
Why would she file a lawsuit
when she's the one at fault?

940
01:07:51,849 --> 01:07:55,614
Why do assailants always have
the same kind of argument?

941
01:07:56,430 --> 01:07:57,555
What?

942
01:07:58,089 --> 01:07:59,089
How did you...

943
01:07:59,089 --> 01:08:01,255
How did I know it was you?

944
01:08:02,099 --> 01:08:03,225
The photo.

945
01:08:03,529 --> 01:08:06,795
The photo you sent
from Han Wool's tablet PC.

946
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:08,595
That was the key evidence.

947
01:08:11,809 --> 01:08:13,604
- "Who's the culprit?"
- Then our team should...

948
01:08:13,609 --> 01:08:16,475
"Who stole that photo
and uploaded a post online?"

949
01:08:17,109 --> 01:08:18,644
The source was the tablet PC.

950
01:08:19,009 --> 01:08:22,845
The tablet PC was left unattended
on Monday during the team meeting.

951
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:27,585
- Ju Yeon.
- That left me with two suspects.

952
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:32,954
His teammates, Hong Jun Su
and Lee Ju Yeon.

953
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:35,124
Let's go to the bathroom.

954
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:40,995
I'm not sure if you meant bad
from the very beginning.

955
01:08:42,269 --> 01:08:45,904
At first, you could've done it
out of curiosity.

956
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:50,704
You looked through his tablet PC
since it wasn't locked,

957
01:08:50,849 --> 01:08:53,775
and you happened to find
a photo of me in there.

958
01:08:54,079 --> 01:08:57,144
Then you sent it to your cell phone.

959
01:08:57,519 --> 01:09:01,954
You could've done all that
impulsively.

960
01:09:02,119 --> 01:09:03,684
But three days later,

961
01:09:04,359 --> 01:09:07,394
you used that photo
to upload a post online.

962
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,624
And that wasn't you
being impulsive or curious.

963
01:09:10,529 --> 01:09:12,164
You did it out of malice.

964
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:16,204
You thought it was safe since that
photo was from Han Wool's tablet PC.

965
01:09:16,509 --> 01:09:18,369
Then you trimmed the photo
and uploaded it...

966
01:09:18,369 --> 01:09:19,904
so it'd be hard to recognize
who it was.

967
01:09:20,009 --> 01:09:21,779
And you were careful
with what you wrote...

968
01:09:21,779 --> 01:09:23,604
so that it wouldn't get you
in any legal trouble.

969
01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:28,515
If anything went south,
you were going to frame Han Wool.

970
01:09:28,519 --> 01:09:31,190
You minimized the possibility
of your getting in danger,

971
01:09:31,190 --> 01:09:34,454
and at the same time, you managed
to attack me very successfully.

972
01:09:36,059 --> 01:09:38,490
Do you have nothing better to do?

973
01:09:38,490 --> 01:09:41,894
- Hey.
- Why did you bother to do all that?

974
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,325
And...

975
01:09:45,230 --> 01:09:48,434
how did you know
that I was dating three guys?

976
01:09:50,539 --> 01:09:51,904
You want to know why I did it?

977
01:09:54,210 --> 01:09:57,174
You think everyone is a joke,
don't you?

978
01:09:57,579 --> 01:09:58,944
You look down on everyone.

979
01:09:59,009 --> 01:10:00,619
You don't treat people
as human beings.

980
01:10:00,619 --> 01:10:02,114
You think of them like tools
or nice scenery.

981
01:10:02,349 --> 01:10:05,985
That's why you didn't even think
it was necessary to hide it.

982
01:10:06,589 --> 01:10:07,819
It was so obvious.

983
01:10:07,819 --> 01:10:10,085
The guys are dumb
to have gotten fooled.

984
01:10:10,829 --> 01:10:12,624
There wasn't a grand motivation
behind what I did.

985
01:10:12,730 --> 01:10:14,725
I just don't like you. That's why.

986
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:18,400
Girls like you are the reason why
people badmouth women.

987
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,240
You go around dating anyone.

988
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:21,934
You're so easy
and have no morals or ethics...

989
01:10:22,299 --> 01:10:24,005
Gosh, I'm sorry.

990
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:26,440
I couldn't bear to hear what was
coming out of your mouth.

991
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:28,440
- Hey!
- What do you mean I'm easy?

992
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,349
I'm not easy at all.

993
01:10:30,349 --> 01:10:32,049
I don't date just anyone.

994
01:10:32,049 --> 01:10:35,619
I picked my guys. They just
happened to be more than one.

995
01:10:35,619 --> 01:10:37,949
- That kind of attitude is...
- But...

996
01:10:37,950 --> 01:10:41,285
how is that the reason why
women get badmouthed?

997
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:43,930
If you think I did something wrong,

998
01:10:43,930 --> 01:10:45,624
you should badmouth me.

999
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,769
If people blame my actions
on my gender,

1000
01:10:49,769 --> 01:10:51,765
that only shows how uneducated
they are.

1001
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:55,869
Girls like you are the problem,
not me.

1002
01:10:55,869 --> 01:10:57,910
Girls like you make
a ridiculous generalization like...

1003
01:10:57,910 --> 01:11:00,210
"Women are their own enemies."

1004
01:11:00,210 --> 01:11:02,805
And you conveniently give
an excuse to some fools.

1005
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:06,414
If you don't like how I behave,
just say it to my face.

1006
01:11:06,579 --> 01:11:08,579
And if you don't want to face me,

1007
01:11:08,579 --> 01:11:10,745
just badmouth me to your friends.

1008
01:11:11,849 --> 01:11:13,990
What you did was a foul play...

1009
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:16,230
because you knew
that the method you chose...

1010
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:19,055
was the most humiliating way
to attack me as a fellow woman.

1011
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:21,555
And that's what you were going for.

1012
01:11:22,799 --> 01:11:24,669
You are so annoying.

1013
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:26,940
Yes. So what?

1014
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:28,664
You're so irritating.

1015
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,604
It would've been nice
if this was the end of it.

1016
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,305
But this is unfortunate.

1017
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:40,874
Pardon?

1018
01:11:41,549 --> 01:11:44,985
Your photo got posted, after all.

1019
01:11:48,759 --> 01:11:51,255
("The Identity of the Double-Life
Sexy Brainstorm Revealed")

1020
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,864
These jerks.

1021
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:13,614
I should have talked
with everyone from the get-go.

1022
01:12:15,819 --> 01:12:17,485
If I had done that...

1023
01:12:19,019 --> 01:12:21,220
- "Identity of the Double-Life..."
- "Identity of the Double-Life..."

1024
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:23,755
- "Sexy Brainstorm Revealed".
- "Sexy Brainstorm Revealed".

1025
01:12:25,859 --> 01:12:28,825
This lame post wouldn't
have been up in the first place.

1026
01:12:30,230 --> 01:12:33,164
Did you think I wouldn't know?
Or did you do this on purpose?

1027
01:12:33,299 --> 01:12:36,140
Every sentence in this post
is poorly constructed and immature.

1028
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:39,434
This is quite embarrassing
to read this, Da Ham.

1029
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:41,579
"She was..."

1030
01:12:41,579 --> 01:12:43,809
"a coldhearted woman,
unable to love anyone by nature."

1031
01:12:43,809 --> 01:12:45,104
"Coldhearted"?

1032
01:12:45,410 --> 01:12:46,420
(Cool-hearted)

1033
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:49,049
"She exploited
men's fatefulness for her."

1034
01:12:49,049 --> 01:12:51,019
"Cool-hearted"? It's "coldhearted".

1035
01:12:51,019 --> 01:12:52,390
You knew what that meant
when you typed it, right?

1036
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:53,815
It means I'm a cold person.

1037
01:12:53,859 --> 01:12:55,289
- Listen...
- Whenever you misspelled words,

1038
01:12:55,289 --> 01:12:57,325
it was such a turn-off.
Did you know that?

1039
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:01,995
Oh, right. Si Han,
you provided the photo.

1040
01:13:02,799 --> 01:13:04,430
Did you think I wouldn't know
it came from you?

1041
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:06,699
DA? Du Ah's Folder?

1042
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:09,539
You saved every single photo
I posted on my social media.

1043
01:13:09,539 --> 01:13:12,069
I posted the photos
but deleted them right away.

1044
01:13:12,069 --> 01:13:13,480
And you're the only one
who would save them.

1045
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:17,180
Of course. Sang Woo, you were
the one who came up...

1046
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:18,879
with the idea, right?

1047
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:21,679
Du Ah is planning to go to
a graduate school next year.

1048
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:24,220
- Let's write that.
- Graduate school.

1049
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:26,819
And among the three of you,
you were the only one...

1050
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:29,654
who knew I was preparing
to attend a graduate school.

1051
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:34,799
All of you were sloppy
with the post.

1052
01:13:34,799 --> 01:13:37,369
Then, did you call us here,
so you can tell us that?

1053
01:13:37,369 --> 01:13:38,630
You lied. You said
you wanted to see us.

1054
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:41,369
I didn't want to "see" you
in a good way.

1055
01:13:41,369 --> 01:13:42,569
What did you expect?

1056
01:13:42,569 --> 01:13:45,505
Now that you know
we were behind that,

1057
01:13:45,509 --> 01:13:48,505
- you called us here, so...
- We're breaking up.

1058
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:52,575
How can I be in a relationship
with guys who exposed me like this?

1059
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:57,549
How could you break up
with us in a group?

1060
01:13:57,549 --> 01:13:59,519
Efficiency isn't the key here.

1061
01:13:59,519 --> 01:14:01,359
You should know
there are etiquettes in breakups.

1062
01:14:01,359 --> 01:14:04,190
Don't expect any etiquettes from
a girl who dates three guys at once.

1063
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:05,960
Were we even in a relationship?

1064
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,154
Do you think you can just toy
with people's hearts?

1065
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:09,964
Which one of us dated you first?

1066
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:14,269
Why does that matter now?

1067
01:14:14,269 --> 01:14:15,394
No.

1068
01:14:15,970 --> 01:14:19,364
After all we've been through,
we deserve to know the truth.

1069
01:14:20,109 --> 01:14:22,579
Will that help you
put an end to this?

1070
01:14:22,579 --> 01:14:25,644
Well, we want to hear
your answer first.

1071
01:14:30,450 --> 01:14:34,255
Number 1, number 2, and number 3.

1072
01:14:34,819 --> 01:14:38,255
Why did you end up
dating three guys at once?

1073
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:42,130
Because I was dating three of you
at once, we never got into fights.

1074
01:14:42,130 --> 01:14:43,930
That's why our relationships
were good.

1075
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:46,869
My expectations from you
were within your capacities.

1076
01:14:46,869 --> 01:14:48,735
What was out of my capacities?

1077
01:14:49,269 --> 01:14:51,670
Well, do I have to
spell it out for you?

1078
01:14:51,670 --> 01:14:52,980
You must.

1079
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:55,975
I believe relationships require
etiquettes and protocols.

1080
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:57,680
"Etiquettes and protocols"?

1081
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:00,019
You shouldn't deceive
or betray your partner...

1082
01:15:00,019 --> 01:15:01,349
out of your consideration for them.
That's basic etiquette.

1083
01:15:01,349 --> 01:15:02,779
Just like we started dating
through communication and agreement,

1084
01:15:02,779 --> 01:15:04,190
breakups should follow
the same protocol.

1085
01:15:04,190 --> 01:15:07,285
That's what you need to do for us.

1086
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,990
So you need me to follow
the protocol now, right?

1087
01:15:09,990 --> 01:15:13,359
I need to explain to you
why I chose this kind of method.

1088
01:15:13,359 --> 01:15:15,525
Yes. You must explain it to us.

1089
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:20,235
Darn it. I didn't want to
talk about this.

1090
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:25,608
Having a guy who had
a crush on me for a year...

1091
01:15:25,609 --> 01:15:27,374
is so valuable...

1092
01:15:27,509 --> 01:15:30,309
because he makes me think
that I'm a good woman.

1093
01:15:30,309 --> 01:15:32,245
He makes me feel better.

1094
01:15:32,349 --> 01:15:36,119
But when I wanted to rely on someone
and needed help,

1095
01:15:36,119 --> 01:15:38,684
he couldn't do that for me.
Not at all.

1096
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:41,319
So I satisfied
that part of my life...

1097
01:15:41,319 --> 01:15:43,490
by dating a mature man...

1098
01:15:43,490 --> 01:15:45,589
whom I could rely on
and ask for help.

1099
01:15:45,589 --> 01:15:49,495
But unfortunately, I wasn't
sexually attracted to him at all.

1100
01:15:51,529 --> 01:15:54,368
And the third guy was able to
satisfy my sexual needs.

1101
01:15:54,369 --> 01:15:56,269
Of course.
As for the lacking qualities...

1102
01:15:56,269 --> 01:15:59,735
of the third guy,
the other two guys...

1103
01:16:00,210 --> 01:16:02,704
definitely filled in for him.

1104
01:16:05,210 --> 01:16:08,519
How could you use my feelings
to boost your ego?

1105
01:16:08,519 --> 01:16:11,250
A mature man is still a man!
I have needs too!

1106
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:12,690
You don't think you can talk to me?

1107
01:16:12,690 --> 01:16:15,154
Have you ever tried to talk to me
other than sleeping with me?

1108
01:16:29,039 --> 01:16:31,404
Hey, why aren't you
answering your phone?

1109
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:33,934
What is this about?

1110
01:16:34,009 --> 01:16:36,075
I don't want you to be shocked.

1111
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:39,104
Like the culprit warned you,

1112
01:16:39,609 --> 01:16:41,220
there was a post
on the online community forum.

1113
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:42,315
I know.

1114
01:16:42,849 --> 01:16:45,085
- You know?
- Yes.

1115
01:16:45,819 --> 01:16:48,654
But the writing seemed
a bit different. It's weird.

1116
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:50,555
I think...

1117
01:16:52,789 --> 01:16:54,700
Do you have anyone in mind?

1118
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:56,464
The three of them are inside.

1119
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,400
- Who?
- The writers behind the post.

1120
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:02,235
Han Si Han, Yeon Sang Woo,
and Yoo Da Ham.

1121
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:04,069
- What?
- Let's talk later. Bye.

1122
01:17:04,069 --> 01:17:06,109
Hey. You can't just go in like that.

1123
01:17:06,109 --> 01:17:08,075
Are you in trouble now?

1124
01:17:09,109 --> 01:17:10,704
I called them here.

1125
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,315
So I can break up with all of them
like you suggested.

1126
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:16,819
- Break up with them?
- You told me to stop all this.

1127
01:17:16,819 --> 01:17:18,650
You wanted me to break up
with all of them.

1128
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:20,414
This all worked out.

1129
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:24,055
I can't date guys
who exposed me like that.

1130
01:17:24,490 --> 01:17:26,659
So you called all of them here?

1131
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:29,095
Yes. That's the easiest way
to deal with this.

1132
01:17:30,930 --> 01:17:33,495
Why do you think
they wrote a post like that?

1133
01:17:34,799 --> 01:17:35,995
Why?

1134
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,904
So you can say
you should've written that yourself?

1135
01:17:40,079 --> 01:17:41,305
Hey.

1136
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:45,845
Why do you keep acting
like the victim?

1137
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:47,920
I didn't leave you.

1138
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,190
If you were so hurt by our breakup,
you shouldn't have been my friend.

1139
01:17:50,190 --> 01:17:52,049
You didn't have to see me.

1140
01:17:52,049 --> 01:17:53,890
If you hated me that much,

1141
01:17:53,890 --> 01:17:55,490
why did you stay friends with me?

1142
01:17:55,490 --> 01:17:57,424
How could I not see you?

1143
01:17:58,359 --> 01:18:00,624
I wouldn't be able to
live without you.

1144
01:18:02,329 --> 01:18:04,795
After that incident
the day before my enlistment,

1145
01:18:04,869 --> 01:18:07,194
you were the one who went
radio silent at me.

1146
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:10,735
I called you right before
I had to enter my boot camp.

1147
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:14,704
I left voice messages at
the payphone, but you never called.

1148
01:18:17,079 --> 01:18:20,245
And you wanted to stay friends
when I got out on my first leave.

1149
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:22,644
As if nothing happened.

1150
01:18:23,319 --> 01:18:25,815
I couldn't live without you.

1151
01:18:27,059 --> 01:18:29,924
And to stay by your side, being
your friend was the only option.

1152
01:18:31,289 --> 01:18:33,495
What other choice did I have?

1153
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:37,295
"Partners benefit
equally from the relationship"?

1154
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:39,470
People you've
exchanged benefits with...

1155
01:18:39,470 --> 01:18:42,134
made posts like that.
Is that your value of love?

1156
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:46,874
Let me ask just one thing.

1157
01:18:49,710 --> 01:18:51,674
Have you ever loved anyone?

1158
01:19:35,390 --> 01:19:37,055
Du Ah, are you free?

1159
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:45,694
That post. About the girl
in the class of 2021.

1160
01:19:46,430 --> 01:19:47,535
It's you, right?

1161
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:48,940
What do you mean?

1162
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:50,710
Stop pretending.

1163
01:19:50,710 --> 01:19:52,535
I could tell right away
from the photo.

1164
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:55,180
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1165
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:57,849
I'm not trying to
rebuke or criticize you...

1166
01:19:57,849 --> 01:19:59,450
for what you did.

1167
01:19:59,450 --> 01:20:01,579
If you're already dating three guys,

1168
01:20:01,579 --> 01:20:04,944
do you think
you could squeeze me in?

1169
01:20:05,390 --> 01:20:07,990
I don't go around spreading gossip.

1170
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:10,588
I'd always had feelings for you...

1171
01:20:10,589 --> 01:20:12,124
for a while now.

1172
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:20,364
You really know nothing about women.

1173
01:20:20,839 --> 01:20:23,970
There's no way
you can get a woman to date you...

1174
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:27,279
by starting a conversation
with blackmail and slander.

1175
01:20:27,279 --> 01:20:29,779
If you wish to win her over,
put in some effort.

1176
01:20:29,779 --> 01:20:33,079
What does she like,
what is she interested in?

1177
01:20:33,079 --> 01:20:35,150
What could you do to please her?

1178
01:20:35,150 --> 01:20:37,490
At least try to figure that out.

1179
01:20:37,490 --> 01:20:39,914
You didn't even give me
a chance to try.

1180
01:20:40,119 --> 01:20:43,624
Trying to win that opportunity
is where the work begins.

1181
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,235
No one is left now.

1182
01:20:56,369 --> 01:21:02,305
Perhaps there was no one
from the very start.

1183
01:21:02,609 --> 01:21:05,845
That's fine. You're 23 years old.

1184
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:09,380
You can try this and that
and every kind of relationship.

1185
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:11,315
You can still bounce back.

1186
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:12,944
It's easy to recover.

1187
01:21:13,089 --> 01:21:16,725
But then you could get
badly burned and give up altogether.

1188
01:21:19,529 --> 01:21:22,454
But what's wrong with that?
That's life too.

1189
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,725
The whole process
is the history of dating.

1190
01:21:28,099 --> 01:21:29,394
Is it?

1191
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:31,565
It's okay.

1192
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:33,809
They say that loving yourself...

1193
01:21:33,809 --> 01:21:36,035
is a romance that lasts a lifetime.

1194
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:39,275
Ditch everything else
and love yourself.

1195
01:21:39,279 --> 01:21:42,214
Do you know what your tragedy is?

1196
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:44,289
You think too much.

1197
01:21:44,289 --> 01:21:47,815
You think you're so smart,
you use your brain too much.

1198
01:21:47,819 --> 01:21:51,430
While others think 2 steps ahead,
you think 3, 4 steps ahead.

1199
01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:54,960
I don't torture my brain on purpose.
It just works that way.

1200
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,595
Anyway, there's a certain timing...

1201
01:21:57,670 --> 01:22:00,694
when you must be
especially mindless.

1202
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:02,665
When is that?

1203
01:22:03,039 --> 01:22:04,765
When you're having sex.

1204
01:22:06,409 --> 01:22:08,935
I should be mindless
when I'm doing it?

1205
01:22:09,139 --> 01:22:12,774
Sex should be just that. Sex.

1206
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:16,044
Don't give it any more meaning.

1207
01:22:18,019 --> 01:22:20,685
The moment
you crossed the line with a friend,

1208
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:24,185
Nam Du Ah got locked up
in this fence.

1209
01:22:25,630 --> 01:22:28,294
"Can I handle these emotions?"

1210
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:32,825
Your heart puts on the brakes.

1211
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:36,665
The brakes.

1212
01:22:37,570 --> 01:22:41,535
When that man
suddenly said he loves you.

1213
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,444
What did you think then?

1214
01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:52,584
Everything in life has a timing.

1215
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:58,584
Timing can bring people together,
but it can also distance people.

1216
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,524
I'll write to you every day.

1217
01:23:08,539 --> 01:23:09,694
Okay.

1218
01:23:10,409 --> 01:23:12,004
Take care.

1219
01:23:15,039 --> 01:23:16,174
Okay.

1220
01:23:16,210 --> 01:23:17,475
No.

1221
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:23,814
I won't write.

1222
01:23:25,590 --> 01:23:27,754
Don't join the army.

1223
01:23:29,219 --> 01:23:31,024
If you join the army,

1224
01:23:33,159 --> 01:23:35,694
who am I to eat with,

1225
01:23:37,130 --> 01:23:38,665
watch movies with,

1226
01:23:39,730 --> 01:23:41,495
and hang out with?

1227
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:43,834
I have no friends.

1228
01:23:46,010 --> 01:23:47,674
I'll visit you often.

1229
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:49,774
No.

1230
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:53,145
Can you just not go?

1231
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:04,325
We were closer than anyone,

1232
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:07,095
and the best of friends.

1233
01:24:07,159 --> 01:24:09,294
The reason
our relationship changed...

1234
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:12,125
was that Han Wool enlisted.

1235
01:24:45,329 --> 01:24:46,595
I love you.

1236
01:25:10,730 --> 01:25:12,625
Just once, before he enlisted,

1237
01:25:13,429 --> 01:25:17,665
That was our first and last time.

1238
01:25:19,070 --> 01:25:21,564
I couldn't believe in love.

1239
01:25:23,269 --> 01:25:27,305
Rather than ruin our friendship
with an imperfect affection,

1240
01:25:28,179 --> 01:25:30,605
I thought it was best
we remain as friends.

1241
01:25:32,110 --> 01:25:34,274
I decided from my own perspective.

1242
01:26:29,839 --> 01:26:31,305
Han Wool.

1243
01:26:38,009 --> 01:26:40,975
Let's go inside. Let's talk inside.

1244
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,075
Did you drink?

1245
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:11,774
With whom?

1246
01:27:12,909 --> 01:27:14,345
Just someone.

1247
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:19,515
I'm sorry.

1248
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:21,989
For what?

1249
01:27:21,989 --> 01:27:23,759
This wouldn't have happened...

1250
01:27:23,759 --> 01:27:25,624
if I had been more careful
with my tablet PC.

1251
01:27:26,290 --> 01:27:27,754
I know it's too late,

1252
01:27:28,330 --> 01:27:31,325
but I feel like I should apologize.

1253
01:27:31,730 --> 01:27:32,925
And?

1254
01:27:35,069 --> 01:27:39,164
I'm also sorry for
always apologizing...

1255
01:27:39,639 --> 01:27:41,305
after speaking my mind out loud.

1256
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:44,175
And?

1257
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:48,374
I'm also sorry for
being so emotional with you...

1258
01:27:51,089 --> 01:27:53,345
when you were the one
having the hardest time.

1259
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:55,084
It's okay.

1260
01:27:55,989 --> 01:27:58,385
It's all in the past now.

1261
01:27:58,989 --> 01:28:00,254
But still,

1262
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:04,024
how could you not contact me
for a whole week?

1263
01:28:04,929 --> 01:28:06,765
I'm sorry for that too.

1264
01:28:10,069 --> 01:28:11,865
I'd also like to apologize.

1265
01:28:12,509 --> 01:28:15,234
Because you were always
so nice to me,

1266
01:28:15,739 --> 01:28:18,044
I let myself cross the line.

1267
01:28:18,650 --> 01:28:20,374
I just thought you'd still
be there for me...

1268
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:23,044
no matter how mean I was to you.

1269
01:28:24,219 --> 01:28:25,750
I shouldn't have done that.

1270
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:27,785
No, you were nothing like that.

1271
01:28:31,330 --> 01:28:32,630
But Han Wool.

1272
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:36,195
You should be apologizing to me
about something else, you know.

1273
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:38,024
What?

1274
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:40,225
The day before you went to the army,

1275
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:44,535
you told me you loved me
all of a sudden.

1276
01:28:49,409 --> 01:28:51,805
It's true that I was confused.

1277
01:28:52,710 --> 01:28:55,374
When I heard that you were
suddenly going to go to the army,

1278
01:28:55,949 --> 01:28:57,785
I found myself feeling peculiar.

1279
01:28:58,549 --> 01:29:00,385
I kept wondering...

1280
01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:02,684
why I was feeling that way.

1281
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:05,325
Especially on the very last day.

1282
01:29:07,759 --> 01:29:11,225
But that's when you suddenly
told me you loved me.

1283
01:29:18,869 --> 01:29:20,234
I love you.

1284
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:23,635
I was flustered.

1285
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:28,675
I couldn't give you an answer,

1286
01:29:29,650 --> 01:29:32,515
but you seemed so resolute about it.

1287
01:29:35,619 --> 01:29:37,425
And that's why it scared me.

1288
01:29:41,330 --> 01:29:44,425
You know I tend to think too much.

1289
01:29:45,469 --> 01:29:47,934
I don't think I was brave enough...

1290
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:50,705
to take our relationship
to another level.

1291
01:29:51,810 --> 01:29:53,035
But...

1292
01:29:53,869 --> 01:29:56,475
after I ran away from you,

1293
01:29:58,150 --> 01:29:59,845
I felt lonely.

1294
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:05,044
You know you're my only friend.

1295
01:30:08,319 --> 01:30:12,785
After I ran away from
my only friend, schoolmate,

1296
01:30:14,130 --> 01:30:15,825
and the only guy...

1297
01:30:16,429 --> 01:30:18,564
I felt a connection with,

1298
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:20,734
I suddenly felt so lost.

1299
01:30:22,739 --> 01:30:24,635
That's why I tried
to come up with a way...

1300
01:30:26,310 --> 01:30:30,205
to fill your space.

1301
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:32,845
And that's why you dated
those three guys?

1302
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:36,814
- Yes.
- You're stupid.

1303
01:30:37,049 --> 01:30:39,385
It's impossible
to fill my space.

1304
01:30:39,889 --> 01:30:41,414
Whatever.

1305
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:49,695
Du Ah.

1306
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:53,294
Then how about now?

1307
01:30:53,469 --> 01:30:54,595
What?

1308
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:58,405
I'm right here next to you.

1309
01:31:00,339 --> 01:31:03,575
You don't need those guys
to replace me anymore.

1310
01:31:07,009 --> 01:31:08,475
Will you let me...

1311
01:31:10,279 --> 01:31:12,484
stay beside you again?

1312
01:31:16,420 --> 01:31:17,725
Han Wool.

1313
01:31:18,790 --> 01:31:19,925
Yes?

1314
01:31:20,730 --> 01:31:23,024
I think there's an expiry date...

1315
01:31:24,230 --> 01:31:26,865
for all relationships.

1316
01:31:28,839 --> 01:31:31,905
You're so precious to me.

1317
01:31:32,610 --> 01:31:35,805
I love you and care for you so much.

1318
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:40,745
But I think that's because
we're friends.

1319
01:31:41,119 --> 01:31:43,914
We're so perfect as friends.

1320
01:31:44,350 --> 01:31:45,745
And I don't...

1321
01:31:47,690 --> 01:31:50,785
want to ruin what we have.

1322
01:31:52,889 --> 01:31:55,425
You think we're perfect as friends?

1323
01:31:58,429 --> 01:32:00,325
Just be honest with me.

1324
01:32:03,569 --> 01:32:05,604
Whether I remain as a friend
or your boyfriend,

1325
01:32:08,679 --> 01:32:11,104
do you feel like
you can live without me now?

1326
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:30,055
I should go.

1327
01:32:45,110 --> 01:32:46,905
I'm sorry.

1328
01:33:18,679 --> 01:33:20,544
You'll be fine.

1329
01:33:42,469 --> 01:33:43,865
My gosh.

1330
01:35:55,639 --> 01:35:57,595
Friends or lovers.

1331
01:35:57,739 --> 01:35:59,770
Why was I so caught up
with the labels...

1332
01:35:59,770 --> 01:36:01,934
that determined relationships?

1333
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:06,575
<i>All the leaves are brown</i>

1334
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:10,845
<i>And the sky is gray</i>

1335
01:36:11,619 --> 01:36:14,885
<i>I've been for a walk</i>

1336
01:36:16,290 --> 01:36:19,254
<i>On a winter's day</i>

1337
01:36:19,989 --> 01:36:22,854
<i>I'd be safe and warm</i>

1338
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:25,825
Come on.
Don't spill food when you eat!

1339
01:36:25,969 --> 01:36:28,195
- Brat.
- "Brat"?

1340
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:29,894
Am I your brat?

1341
01:36:34,270 --> 01:36:36,374
I'm turning. Hey, I'm turning.

1342
01:36:36,610 --> 01:36:39,405
Buk-boogie. Hey, Buk-boogie.

1343
01:36:39,650 --> 01:36:40,904
On me?

1344
01:36:43,079 --> 01:36:46,044
Oh, my! I think it likes me.

1345
01:36:47,119 --> 01:36:48,984
I didn't know how to love him.

1346
01:36:49,289 --> 01:36:51,889
But I realized that
if I wanted him by my side...

1347
01:36:51,889 --> 01:36:54,555
and didn't want to lose him,
I should have been honest.

1348
01:36:56,400 --> 01:37:00,395
I should have been honest
when I needed to be honest.

1349
01:37:02,239 --> 01:37:06,134
And I realized that too late.

1350
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:10,174
(Present)

1351
01:37:39,269 --> 01:37:42,435
I'm sure a coincidence
will bring us together again.

1352
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:58,325
That fool.

1353
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:18,510
(Buk-boogie)

1354
01:38:18,510 --> 01:38:19,605
Hey.

1355
01:38:20,550 --> 01:38:22,814
All you do is sleep, you know?

1356
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:32,654
Hello?

1357
01:38:33,190 --> 01:38:37,055
Is this Do Han Wool?

1358
01:38:37,599 --> 01:38:38,964
(Restricted number)

1359
01:38:40,429 --> 01:38:41,670
Yes, this is he.

1360
01:38:41,670 --> 01:38:43,670
I have a package for you.

1361
01:38:43,670 --> 01:38:44,864
Du Ah.

1362
01:38:58,289 --> 01:39:02,455
(Bomb)

1363
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:04,584
"Bomb"?

1364
01:39:06,329 --> 01:39:07,825
This is so typical of Du Ah.

1365
01:39:13,670 --> 01:39:16,039
(Ddo-boogie)

1366
01:39:16,039 --> 01:39:17,334
"Ddo-boogie".

1367
01:39:27,820 --> 01:39:31,685
There are no coincidences
in the world, you fool.

1368
01:40:06,590 --> 01:40:07,884
Hey, Du Ah.

1369
01:40:12,889 --> 01:40:14,254
Hello.

1370
01:40:26,670 --> 01:40:32,075
(Number 23 is over!)

1371
01:40:33,946 --> 01:40:36,300
(Love Scene Number)
