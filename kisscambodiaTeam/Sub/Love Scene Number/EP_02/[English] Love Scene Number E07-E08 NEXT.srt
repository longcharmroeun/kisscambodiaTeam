1
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,619
Is there anyone who lives their life...

2
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,460
thinking that the ground under them
could break apart at any given time?

3
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,160
That day,

4
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,160
at 3:35am...

5
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,440
Everything that I thought...

6
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,419
was impregnable fell apart.

7
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:58,559
LOVE SCENE NUMBER 42

8
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,799
Gosh, my back.

9
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,469
Do we have to use this?

10
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:51,180
It looks pretty.

11
00:02:58,339 --> 00:03:00,239
How did it go all the way there?

12
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:04,119
That startled me.

13
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:06,079
Gosh.

14
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:10,959
Goodness.

15
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,389
Gosh.

16
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,829
You should've stacked...

17
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:18,660
my sanitary pads properly.
They all fell down.

18
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,299
It was so full.

19
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,570
You didn't use any last month.

20
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,310
Come to think of it, I didn't
have my period last month.

21
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,739
There's no way I could be pregnant, right?

22
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,679
I can barely remember
how many navels you have.

23
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:39,919
Could there be something wrong with me?

24
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,790
I only have one navel.

25
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,230
What?

26
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,500
Remember when you had something
growing on your chest,

27
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,040
and it was as big as your nipple?

28
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,169
Yes, it was situated perfectly to
be mistaken for a third nipple.

29
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:02,639
But it wasn't my navel.

30
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,639
Eat up. The food's getting cold.

31
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,679
I have to say, it's been quite a long time.

32
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,679
It shouldn't exceed 58 days.

33
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,290
Do you think I'm already...

34
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,220
Never mind.

35
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:27,260
Should I call the OB-GYN?
Should we go together...

36
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,519
What are you doing?

37
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,820
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,120
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,789
Are you okay? You're not hurt, right?

40
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,089
What was that? Gosh.

41
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,320
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:54,589
Gosh.

43
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,800
I'm afraid we're fully booked this week.

44
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:05,639
You can preorder by the end of this month.

45
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:08,639
No, we're completely booked.

46
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:13,579
Okay. I'm sorry. Please
call again later. Goodbye.

47
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,979
Why are you already here?

48
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:18,979
There are even early birds
who come in earlier than me.

49
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,519
Right. I've placed the
subsidiary materials inside.

50
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:25,920
You could've just checked
them. They must've been heavy.

51
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,089
Goodness, I shouldn't expect
to get paid if I'm that lazy.

52
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:31,659
I should starve too.

53
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,099
All right. Eat up, then.

54
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,649
Look.

55
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,149
You could give me another
customer's product first.

56
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:53,180
I'll pay more.

57
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,719
I'm sorry, but we can't sell
you another customer's product.

58
00:05:56,719 --> 00:05:58,360
Do you think you can
maintain your business...

59
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,120
if you cause such a big
hassle over a single wardrobe?

60
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,930
If you keep this up...

61
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,930
Then look for some other shop
that's willing to do that.

62
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,829
You should leave. We're fine.

63
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,099
Goodbye.

64
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,300
Hey.

65
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:11,170
Where do you think you're going
when I'm not done talking just yet?

66
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,969
You can talk with me.

67
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,339
Please sit down.

68
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,029
Can I open the door?

69
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:44,029
Yes.

70
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:48,639
Did your period start?

71
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,670
No, it's just a bloody discharge.

72
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,079
Let's go to the OB-GYN. I'll
book a time for tomorrow.

73
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,709
No, it's okay.

74
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,279
I'm not in a hurry. We can go this weekend.

75
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,320
Actually, let's just not go.

76
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:02,389
Let's go. You should also
get your regular checkup.

77
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,459
Give me that.

78
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,110
Let's go home.

79
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:24,709
What time is it?

80
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:25,940
It's past 12am.

81
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,510
Already?

82
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:33,950
Gosh, my back.

83
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,040
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

84
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,979
Why did you keep it a
secret for an entire month?

85
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:06,940
I was going to take care of it myself.

86
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,950
That's...

87
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:14,150
That's not the problem.

88
00:09:14,349 --> 00:09:16,520
You should've told me first.

89
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,060
I mean... Why did you feel
the need to keep it from me?

90
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:21,829
I didn't want you to know.

91
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:22,959
You only made it worse.

92
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,499
That's not the only lumber mill.

93
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:29,170
Had we known sooner, it
wouldn't have gotten this worse.

94
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,499
The deadline is around the corner...

95
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,379
Okay.

96
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,640
Where are you going?

97
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,310
Please do that.

98
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,749
- Hello.
- Hello.

99
00:09:45,749 --> 00:09:47,450
It's been a long time.

100
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,950
- Where's your boss?
- He's inside.

101
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,249
- Go over there.
- Okay.

102
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:55,729
Thank you so much for
helping us out so suddenly.

103
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,400
Goodness, you don't need to be thankful.

104
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:04,570
We're just happy that we
can work with you again.

105
00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:05,739
Not at all.

106
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,300
We switched mills a long time ago.

107
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,910
I feel terrible asking
for your help like this.

108
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,280
It was really urgent.

109
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,509
You saved us.

110
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:16,050
Don't say that. Don't you worry.

111
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,849
Thank you. And I'm also
grateful for your understanding.

112
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,190
Now that we've joined hands again,

113
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,719
let's work together for a very long time.

114
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:25,589
You can count on us.

115
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:26,589
Goodbye.

116
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:50,579
Knock, knock.

117
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,520
Hi.

118
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,280
Let's go eat.

119
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:56,719
You can eat first. I'm fine.

120
00:10:56,749 --> 00:10:58,820
You should join me.

121
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,459
It's getting late and past dinner time.

122
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:04,959
Just like what we talked
about, I don't deserve to eat.

123
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,329
Don't say such a thing.

124
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:09,570
You wanted to take care of it yourself.

125
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,339
There was nothing you could do.

126
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,369
Don't worry too much about it.

127
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,910
I'm not worried. I know she'll do well.

128
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,140
She's unlike me.

129
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,379
She'll probably solve it
right away and not drag on...

130
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:22,780
for a month.

131
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,859
How did it go?

132
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,589
I solved it.

133
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,329
I knew I could count on you.

134
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:40,599
I wasn't worried one bit.

135
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,729
Where's my husband?

136
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,700
He's in the workshop.

137
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,239
He has been there for several hours now.

138
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:50,310
- What is he up to?
- He's sketching.

139
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:57,009
Let's call it a day and go eat.

140
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:59,619
You've been through a lot. You
should have some Korean beef.

141
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:02,089
I can't believe I wrestled with it
for a month when it was this simple.

142
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:04,790
Come on, I'm starving. Let's go.

143
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,459
Gosh, this is nice.

144
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,900
It's tasty.

145
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:18,040
Is there anything else I need to know?

146
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,940
I said no.

147
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,410
Gosh. We've been married for 20 years,

148
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,969
yet I still don't know you.

149
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:27,379
I had no idea you were such a great liar.

150
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,150
I didn't lie. I just didn't tell you.

151
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,379
They're the same thing.

152
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:33,020
We've all been through a lot.

153
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,950
Let's clink our glasses.

154
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:38,560
I have to drive. You can drink.

155
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:44,859
To be honest,

156
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,999
more than losing money and
not meeting the deadline,

157
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:54,239
I'm more hurt by the fact
that you kept it to yourself.

158
00:12:55,969 --> 00:12:58,680
From now on, be open about these things.

159
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,040
Discuss it with me.

160
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,650
Okay?

161
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,249
If I can't solve these things,

162
00:13:08,249 --> 00:13:10,050
what do you need me for?

163
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,589
What use am I?

164
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:14,020
That's not what I meant.

165
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,859
I need to take this.

166
00:13:23,499 --> 00:13:24,739
Gosh.

167
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,629
I got hurt. Can you put some ointment on me?

168
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,270
Sure, but what happened?

169
00:14:31,099 --> 00:14:34,040
The storage closet in the bathroom.
I keep forgetting to fix it.

170
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,070
I hit it.

171
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,239
You should've been more careful.

172
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:38,979
I know. Gosh.

173
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,849
By the way, the bathroom light is too bright.

174
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:44,109
I think we should change it.

175
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:45,249
Really?

176
00:14:46,979 --> 00:14:48,749
Wait outside. I'll disinfect it.

177
00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:49,749
Okay.

178
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Did you...

179
00:15:05,969 --> 00:15:07,940
always have such a broad back?

180
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,509
It's average.

181
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:13,680
No. It looks broader than before.

182
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,079
Maybe it's because I gained weight.

183
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,050
I keep gaining belly fat.

184
00:15:19,349 --> 00:15:20,349
I'm done.

185
00:15:20,749 --> 00:15:21,749
You are?

186
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:29,930
The band wraps around your body tightly.

187
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,459
It covers all the fat that pokes out.

188
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:36,900
It makes your breasts look so pretty
that you just want to flaunt them.

189
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,599
You'll want to flaunt them
since they look beautiful.

190
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:42,839
You can wear this underwear
during the summer.

191
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,770
You're still awake?

192
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,310
Sleep first. I'll join you
once I'm done watching this.

193
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,379
You should go to bed. You must be tired.

194
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:50,950
Go to bed.

195
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,550
Is there anyone here you'd like to work with?

196
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,119
Someone you'd like to do a duet with?

197
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:58,190
- Among everyone here?
- Yes, everyone.

198
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,820
All the singers.

199
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,829
To be honest...

200
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:04,729
You'll get four sets and
extra hemline panties.

201
00:16:04,729 --> 00:16:08,270
This is the best deal you can ever get.

202
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,770
- You're right.
- I know.

203
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,070
They were all sold out
during the launching show.

204
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,099
Every time they appear on TV...

205
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,719
SMALL, LOW, STRONG

206
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:45,099
ABOUT HAN MYUNG WOON'S LIFE

207
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:46,570
AFTER HE CAME BACK TO KOREA,

208
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,999
HE MARRIED HIS WIFE, KWON HWA RAN.

209
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:53,239
Which one do you like the most?

210
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,910
I can't pick.

211
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,680
You're still so awesome.

212
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,690
I'm not. Not at all.

213
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,660
It's true.

214
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:09,229
Among the people I know,
you're the most awesome.

215
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,660
That didn't change.

216
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,729
I can see it in your face.

217
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:16,229
Look who's talking.

218
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,200
Me? Come on.

219
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,900
Not me.

220
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:21,840
Have you been well?

221
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:25,340
Hey, Woon Beom. It's been a long time.

222
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:28,910
When did you fly back?

223
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,110
Recently.

224
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,979
They wanted to do this exhibition,

225
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:35,190
so I hurriedly flew back here.

226
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,519
You must be busy.

227
00:17:37,219 --> 00:17:38,590
Will you be attending the meeting?

228
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,860
Right. In the evening.

229
00:17:42,489 --> 00:17:44,930
I'm afraid I won't be able to go.

230
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,630
It'd be nice to see everyone once again.

231
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:49,930
But my wife...

232
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:54,840
Hwa Ran is ill.

233
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,809
With what?

234
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:00,910
It's not serious.

235
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,150
I think we'll be here for some time.

236
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,650
We should have dinner next time.

237
00:18:06,479 --> 00:18:07,519
Can you give me your number?

238
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,900
I'll call you.

239
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,140
See you later.

240
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,110
Did you look around?

241
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:34,979
Yes. Let's look around once more.

242
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,249
It's so grand.

243
00:18:39,249 --> 00:18:40,249
Cheers.

244
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:42,850
2020 JAEKYUNG, BAESAN-GUN GATHERING

245
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,650
Gosh, this is nice.

246
00:18:46,489 --> 00:18:49,759
By the way, I was so shocked.

247
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:52,860
I heard about how successful they were.

248
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,229
- They run a furniture shop.
- Right.

249
00:18:54,229 --> 00:18:56,170
Chung Kyung played a key
role in the business.

250
00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:00,140
It's not about the looks.
Your skills matter the most.

251
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,039
In that case, she scores 120 out of 100.

252
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,910
Yes, that's right.

253
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,249
- Gosh.
- Then am I minus 20 or something?

254
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,610
Correct.

255
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:12,249
Let's just drink.

256
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,190
Did you guys go to Myung Woon's exhibition?

257
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,420
- We did. It was nice.
- You did?

258
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,590
If he flew back here,

259
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,559
at least Hwa Ran should've come here.

260
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:24,529
It's been years, yet you're
still pining for her.

261
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:27,100
- You jerk.
- Let's be honest. Every guy...

262
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,029
in our neighborhood had a crush on her.

263
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:31,269
Hey, you should just shut it.

264
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,170
You startled me.

265
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,110
She's here. Everyone!

266
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,670
Our dear writer is here.

267
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,940
Applaud!

268
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,110
2020 JAEKYUNG, BAESAN-GUN GATHERING

269
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,380
It's been ages.

270
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,779
We finally meet again.

271
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:49,590
It's been a long time.
I've heard a lot about you.

272
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,350
I heard a lot about you too.

273
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,719
Right. You and Hwa Ran used to be close.

274
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:56,229
You should've told her to come.

275
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:58,289
Hwa Ran is pregnant. She should stay home.

276
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,799
No, wait. She was pregnant.

277
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,999
Oh, was it a slip of the tongue?

278
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:10,670
It's all right. It's
nothing to be ashamed of.

279
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,979
I don't know about anyone else,

280
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:15,009
but she enjoys being sympathized with.

281
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:16,680
Had she recovered, she would've come here...

282
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,580
and told you all about it.

283
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,819
You should watch what you say
about someone who's not even here.

284
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,819
Why should I do that when
I'm only stating the facts?

285
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:30,559
Whether it be true or not, you
have no right to bring that up.

286
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,559
What's wrong?

287
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:34,360
I may not have the right,

288
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:37,269
but I do know very well
what kind of person she is.

289
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,239
Do you know her better than I do?

290
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,809
I'm saying we should be courteous.

291
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,440
Unlike you, others are tender
and can get hurt by your words.

292
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,340
Don't say that.

293
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,380
I'm sorry. I think he's drunk.

294
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,779
No, it's fine.

295
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:54,380
- Hey.
- Oh, dear.

296
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:00,360
Hey.

297
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,690
Gosh.

298
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,160
Can we have another bottle of soju, please?

299
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,709
Hey.

300
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,140
I'm sorry. He's not the type
to talk rashly like that.

301
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,539
He just drank one too many.

302
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:24,680
You don't need to apologize on
his behalf. It's really nothing.

303
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:27,850
Chung Kyung, you really
treat your husband well.

304
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:30,620
Lucky you. I'm jealous.

305
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,059
I don't treat him that well.

306
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:34,890
Didn't you guys start dating back in school?

307
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:40,430
You've been in love with
one man for over 20 years.

308
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,900
How does that feel?

309
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:46,670
Nothing really changed. Only time has passed.

310
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:50,739
Have you ever dreamed of being
in some other guy's arms?

311
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,509
You have.

312
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:56,709
You thought of someone,
didn't you? Who was it?

313
00:21:56,709 --> 00:21:58,309
It's no one.

314
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:03,850
Right, can I have your number?
I want to buy some furniture.

315
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,890
I saw your interview in the
magazine, and I loved it.

316
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,059
I want to customize all
the furniture in my studio.

317
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:10,459
Thank you.

318
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,459
Here. Call me anytime.

319
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,539
Hwa Ran had asked me...

320
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:22,539
to get your number.

321
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,479
Uncomfortable, right?

322
00:22:26,209 --> 00:22:27,809
Forget it, then.

323
00:22:29,709 --> 00:22:33,420
She likes you so much that
it's actually strange.

324
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,789
I'm sure it's uncomfortable.

325
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,319
It's only possible because it's me.

326
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:41,890
Most people wouldn't want to talk
with her for even five minutes.

327
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,160
Right?

328
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:45,930
She already tires you
out by the way she talks.

329
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,759
But then, she calls you her lifesaver.

330
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:50,299
"Chung Kyung."

331
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:55,440
She doesn't know that doing
that makes people feel uneasy.

332
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:56,539
I'm not a lifesaver.

333
00:22:56,539 --> 00:22:58,110
Of course, you are.

334
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,739
You basically saved her life.

335
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,450
Even if you didn't,

336
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:05,719
she always had a soft spot for you...

337
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,080
since you have something she doesn't.

338
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,690
There's something she lacks?

339
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,219
I thought she had everything.

340
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,590
Yes, there is.

341
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:17,360
And it's something you have.

342
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,029
What is it?

343
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:20,029
Anyway,

344
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:23,269
I'll tell her that I forgot
to ask you for your number.

345
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,700
By the way,

346
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,610
have you always worn those kinds of clothes?

347
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:32,739
Why? Does it not suit me?

348
00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:36,880
That's not why. Hwa Ran
used to dress like you.

349
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:50,029
Do you have nothing to wear?

350
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:52,900
I never go out...

351
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:55,600
and always wear comfortable clothes to work.

352
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,900
You should've bought something new.

353
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,140
I have so many clothes that I never wore.

354
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,239
How does this look?

355
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,779
Wouldn't you be too cold?

356
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,850
I'll be wearing something on top.

357
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,229
How about this?

358
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,029
Wear that. It suits you.

359
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:55,789
You couldn't even outdrink me.

360
00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:58,430
- Hey.
- You lost.

361
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,559
- What a loser.
- Watch your head.

362
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,100
- Be careful.
- Go home safely.

363
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,529
- Bye.
- Bye.

364
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,440
The roads have been congested.

365
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,469
There is also an accident.

366
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:12,610
There's quite a bit of traffic...

367
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:15,709
on the Olympic-daero and the Seongsan Bridge.

368
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:18,950
The congestion starts
from the Cheongdam Bridge.

369
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,719
It'll take approximately an hour to travel...

370
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:23,249
from the Cheongdam Bridge
to the Gayang Bridge.

371
00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:26,620
The Gangbyeon Expressway
will take about 50 minutes.

372
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:30,330
The Dongho Bridge toward
Ilsan is also congested.

373
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,259
As for Gangdong, the traffic jam starts...

374
00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:34,499
from Yeouido to the Yeongdong Bridge.

375
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:37,630
The Olympic-daero will take
approximately 45 minutes.

376
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,069
- You're drunk.
- That's the current situation.

377
00:25:40,069 --> 00:25:42,610
On the road from Bundang to Seoul,

378
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,769
there has been a car accident.

379
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:46,140
- No?
- From the crossway...

380
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,479
to the Tancheon 1 Bridge,
the traffic has gotten worse.

381
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:49,749
There's also a traffic jam...

382
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:52,080
from Naegok Tunnel to Guryong Tunnel.

383
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,420
This is the end of the traffic report.

384
00:26:37,489 --> 00:26:38,489
Honey.

385
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,719
I stopped by the department
store due to work.

386
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,090
Today's our wedding anniversary.

387
00:27:08,219 --> 00:27:11,160
What? I totally forgot.

388
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,900
It's okay. You're not the type
to celebrate anniversaries.

389
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,529
But I love receiving gifts, right?

390
00:27:16,529 --> 00:27:17,529
Yes.

391
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,039
What could it be?

392
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,969
It's nothing big.

393
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,420
This is embarrassing.

394
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,219
I thought it'd be nice
to get you new pajamas.

395
00:28:12,459 --> 00:28:15,420
Gosh, why are my hands so rough?

396
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,819
Honey.

397
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,920
Honey?

398
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:58,299
Honey.

399
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:00,239
Honey!

400
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:08,009
Honey. Honey.

401
00:29:08,009 --> 00:29:10,110
Gosh, wake up.

402
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,580
You can't sleep here.

403
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,350
Get up. Come on.

404
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:17,989
What...

405
00:29:19,489 --> 00:29:21,360
My gosh.

406
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:25,860
Gosh, it's cold.

407
00:29:57,489 --> 00:29:59,700
DOCTOR'S OFFICE, WAITING AREA, RECEPTION

408
00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:02,160
Do husbands normally not come here?

409
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:06,600
We're always together seven days a week.

410
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,969
You didn't have to follow me here.

411
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,110
That's more of a reason to come.

412
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,019
Ms. Jung Chung Kyung.

413
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:27,620
Yes. Let's go.

414
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:31,330
You have multiple fibroids,

415
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,660
and one of them is pretty big in size.

416
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,400
It's also located in a bad spot.

417
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,529
Is it serious?

418
00:30:36,529 --> 00:30:39,100
The location of the fibroid
concerns me more than its size.

419
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:41,569
One of your options is to get surgery.

420
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,509
Do you plan to have a baby?

421
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,910
No.

422
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:49,779
It's possible to reduce
the size of the fibroid,

423
00:30:50,009 --> 00:30:52,749
but it's impossible to
get rid of it completely.

424
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,650
And if you often have
multiple fibroids like this,

425
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:00,120
you could also consider removing your uterus.

426
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:01,719
Remove it?

427
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:04,890
Due to its location, it keeps
pressuring your bladder.

428
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:08,130
And it could cause a pelvic
inflammatory disease.

429
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,330
What if she just gets rid of the fibroid?

430
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,900
Then will she be able to get pregnant?

431
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,670
Have you lost your mind?

432
00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:16,940
We're not in the situation to have a baby.

433
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,969
I can't get pregnant.

434
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,610
Physically speaking, she
may be comparatively old,

435
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:24,650
but it's still possible.

436
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,180
I'll prescribe you some medicine for today.

437
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,819
Then you can get a shot before you leave.

438
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:31,319
Okay. Thank you.

439
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,729
OB-GYN

440
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:53,380
Do you want a baby?

441
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,410
What?

442
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,279
Have you been wanting me to get pregnant?

443
00:31:59,009 --> 00:32:01,219
Do you know when we last had sex?

444
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:03,190
I can't even remember
how many years it's been.

445
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,690
Are you even able to get it up?

446
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,489
- Chung Kyung.
- You never mentioned this before.

447
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,130
So why the sudden change?

448
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:15,059
I just asked for no reason.

449
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:16,729
Don't be ridiculous.

450
00:32:16,729 --> 00:32:18,600
You couldn't have asked that for no reason.

451
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,170
It means you've been thinking about that.

452
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:23,569
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
asked that all of a sudden.

453
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,580
I thought you weren't ready to raise a baby.

454
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:30,779
You told me you didn't want to
sacrifice our lives for a baby.

455
00:32:30,979 --> 00:32:33,150
You said that 10 years ago.

456
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,180
You see,

457
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,860
during our entire marriage,

458
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:43,229
I was already swamped with...

459
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,860
taking care of our problems.

460
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,400
I was always busy paying back our loan.

461
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,170
We barely made ends meet.

462
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:54,100
And our lives finally started
to become a little more stable.

463
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,269
- I just...
- We're in our mid 40s soon.

464
00:32:57,469 --> 00:32:59,709
We're not in our late
40s. We're not in our 50s.

465
00:32:59,709 --> 00:33:02,610
But I already have a hard
time taking care of myself.

466
00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:03,950
And on top of that,

467
00:33:07,979 --> 00:33:09,319
I might have to...

468
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,789
remove my uterus because of a fibroid.

469
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,489
How could you ask her...

470
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:19,299
if I could get pregnant
even after hearing that?

471
00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:23,969
- I'm sorry.
- If we were going to have a baby,

472
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:26,539
that should've happened
10 years ago, not now.

473
00:33:26,969 --> 00:33:29,340
Not now when we're in our mid 40s!
It should've happened 10 years ago!

474
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,090
I think she has a cold.

475
00:33:46,719 --> 00:33:47,819
I'm going to let her rest.

476
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,729
Yes. You should also take
the day off, Ms. Jang.

477
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:53,400
I'll call you later in the evening.

478
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,529
Okay, bye.

479
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,739
Pumpkin soup?

480
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,000
Eating this...

481
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,500
reminds me of the past.

482
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,200
That day...

483
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,569
It's been about 15 years, right?

484
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:15,640
I can't even remember
what I ate a few days ago.

485
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,279
But strangely enough,

486
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,120
I can remember that day very clearly.

487
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,560
This soup...

488
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:32,629
The day...

489
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,660
you made me this soup
for the very first time.

490
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:43,310
I didn't know the skin of sweet
pumpkins would be this hard.

491
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,040
Unlike the skin, the inside is really soft.

492
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,879
They're harder to slice than zucchinis.

493
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,850
So much for its name, right?

494
00:35:50,379 --> 00:35:53,080
I just thought they were sweet
because it's called a sweet pumpkin.

495
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,250
There we go.

496
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:59,520
Should I use the rest of the
mung beans to make pancakes?

497
00:35:59,989 --> 00:36:02,689
Actually, never mind. You
won't like the greasy smell.

498
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,500
You should have a bite.

499
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:13,299
I cooled it down, so you
can have it right away.

500
00:36:17,439 --> 00:36:18,439
Have a bite.

501
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:54,910
It's delicious.

502
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,149
Have some more. Here.

503
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:11,230
Yes, you really liked it.

504
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,230
Yes.

505
00:37:15,759 --> 00:37:17,629
It was really good.

506
00:37:19,969 --> 00:37:21,500
You had starved for days.

507
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,009
Anything would've tasted good.

508
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:28,980
My throat hurt...

509
00:37:29,609 --> 00:37:32,009
even when I drank water.

510
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,850
And I didn't even have the
energy to hold a spoon.

511
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:39,589
But it still tasted delicious.

512
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:43,759
How could it not taste good?

513
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,830
You worked so hard to make that for me.

514
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,370
So it just had to taste good.

515
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:54,040
Thank you for saying that.

516
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:08,020
I still remember how it felt...

517
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,890
to lose our child back then.

518
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:21,129
So how could I dare to get pregnant again?

519
00:38:23,169 --> 00:38:24,469
Don't you think so?

520
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,350
Don't cry. You're all grown up.

521
00:39:23,689 --> 00:39:24,689
Why is he up?

522
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,560
Seeing that he got up...

523
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,129
just by seeing his cell phone light up...

524
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:01,230
means he wasn't sleeping at all.

525
00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:07,600
Since when did he keep
his cell phone on mute?

526
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,870
Since when...

527
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:15,239
did he mute his cell phone and
sleep with it under his pillow?

528
00:41:10,169 --> 00:41:12,069
EMERGENCY CENTER

529
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:17,609
EMERGENCY CENTER

530
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,439
ABOUT HAN MYUNG WOON'S LIFE

531
00:42:25,439 --> 00:42:26,540
AFTER HE CAME BACK TO KOREA, HE
MARRIED HIS WIFE, KWON HWA RAN.

532
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,839
A MIXTURE OF BRIGHTNESS AND DARKNESS...

533
00:42:32,779 --> 00:42:34,049
The woman...

534
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:37,850
who made my husband wake up...

535
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,560
just by making his cell phone light up.

536
00:42:42,689 --> 00:42:43,890
Why does that woman...

537
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,879
have to be Kwon Hwa Ran of all people?

538
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:09,520
All the guys in the
neighborhood had a crush on her.

539
00:43:14,089 --> 00:43:15,089
You must be cold.

540
00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:16,890
And I liked her too.

541
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:17,989
Just a second.

542
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,529
- Here.
- Thanks.

543
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:29,569
The white lace bra that she wore...

544
00:43:31,439 --> 00:43:33,910
was beautiful enough to
even appear in my dream.

545
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:38,879
But I was never able to wear it myself...

546
00:43:42,819 --> 00:43:44,750
except for that one day.

547
00:43:45,919 --> 00:43:48,160
It was an unplanned trip.

548
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:52,730
Up until then, my husband and I...

549
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,100
were just friends.

550
00:43:58,299 --> 00:44:00,100
Come to think of it,

551
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:02,700
that day was when rumors spread...

552
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:05,969
saying the 23-year-old
Kwon Hwa Ran got pregnant.

553
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:26,430
The bathroom light is too bright.

554
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:27,730
I think we should change it.

555
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:28,730
Really?

556
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:54,859
Will I be able to live without my husband?

557
00:45:04,169 --> 00:45:05,770
For the past 20 years, my husband was...

558
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,899
my friend.

559
00:45:08,899 --> 00:45:11,410
These organic sanitary pads are
known to be really expensive.

560
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:12,640
It's hard to find them too.

561
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:15,609
I heard they're better for
you. I'll buy them regularly.

562
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:30,989
He was my lover.

563
00:45:31,089 --> 00:45:33,129
I GOT YOU SOMETHING TO EAT.

564
00:45:35,129 --> 00:45:37,370
He was my business partner and companion.

565
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:40,140
Honey.

566
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,480
And without a doubt, he was my best friend.

567
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:57,520
He was my man.

568
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:01,919
He was everything to me.

569
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:08,460
Will I be able to live without him?

570
00:46:19,669 --> 00:46:21,339
Will I get used to it...

571
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:25,310
just like everyone else?

572
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:33,879
I don't think I can do it.

573
00:47:37,189 --> 00:47:38,189
I don't think...

574
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,689
I can live without him.

575
00:48:14,619 --> 00:48:16,019
Did they sleep together?

576
00:48:32,769 --> 00:48:35,570
Since when have we stopped having sex?

577
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:51,149
I can't do it.

578
00:49:01,759 --> 00:49:05,530
Why couldn't we do it?

579
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,780
Is it because of me?

580
00:49:50,379 --> 00:49:53,480
We'll go with the design
we discussed earlier.

581
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,780
It'll cost this much.

582
00:49:54,879 --> 00:49:56,989
I'll text you the details.

583
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,590
Okay.

584
00:50:02,659 --> 00:50:03,760
Ji Sung.

585
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:07,260
You hired us, so I'll buy you lunch.

586
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,230
Ms. Jang, you should have lunch with Mr. Woo.

587
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:12,229
Okay, I'll do that.

588
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:24,479
I heard that Hwa Ran's sick.

589
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:27,020
I didn't know she'd miscarried.

590
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:29,349
I'd like to know what happened.

591
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:31,419
You didn't ask last time.

592
00:50:31,419 --> 00:50:32,490
Well,

593
00:50:32,789 --> 00:50:35,759
our last meeting wasn't
the time or place to ask.

594
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:38,930
I'd like to arrange to see her again,

595
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:40,430
but I don't want to be rude.

596
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,199
This wasn't the first time. It
happened a few times before.

597
00:50:44,569 --> 00:50:48,069
It's more a broken heart
than a physical illness.

598
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,139
Her husband's so busy.

599
00:50:50,169 --> 00:50:52,210
He can't indulge her every whim.

600
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:54,680
So, eventually,

601
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,979
her broken heart makes
her physically sick too.

602
00:50:57,479 --> 00:50:58,849
That's what it is.

603
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:01,050
Isn't she close with her husband?

604
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:04,819
He doesn't seem to mind not having kids.

605
00:51:04,819 --> 00:51:08,460
Hwa Ran insists on having
her husband's child.

606
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,889
It's almost an obsession.

607
00:51:11,189 --> 00:51:13,930
She doesn't seem to care about
the toll it takes on her body.

608
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:15,530
That's why it happens.

609
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:39,590
What does Hwa Ran mean to my husband?

610
00:51:42,219 --> 00:51:45,090
Was he trying to get something
he couldn't get from me?

611
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:49,030
Is a physical affair...

612
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,800
better than an emotional one?

613
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,000
One or the other.

614
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,710
Which one could I forgive?

615
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,219
Which one is...

616
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:14,620
worse?

617
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,300
I prefer to do this by hand.

618
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,870
You know well.

619
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:38,610
It's delicious. Try it.

620
00:52:44,149 --> 00:52:46,420
She hurt herself at work.

621
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:48,120
It's not bad, fortunately.

622
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:50,730
That's too bad.

623
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,329
She'll be more careful.

624
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:55,699
You're such a good cook, Father.

625
00:52:55,829 --> 00:52:57,970
I should learn from you when I have the time.

626
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:00,370
You're too busy to visit often.

627
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:04,110
If there's anything you want,
I'll cook and send it to you.

628
00:53:04,209 --> 00:53:05,310
Thank you.

629
00:53:05,639 --> 00:53:07,980
Why did Mom's food taste so bad?

630
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:12,449
It wasn't too sweet, salty, or bitter.

631
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:14,350
It was oddly terrible.

632
00:53:15,449 --> 00:53:16,879
But Dad,

633
00:53:17,389 --> 00:53:20,120
you never complained about
her food while she lived.

634
00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:22,920
That's what your mom was like.

635
00:53:23,959 --> 00:53:25,829
She was a housewife all her life,

636
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:27,360
but she was a poor housekeeper,

637
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,930
and she wasn't a good cook.

638
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,470
Even though she tried hard.

639
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:34,040
Is that why you cheated on her?

640
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:40,939
If her food tasted bad,
you should've just said so.

641
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:44,180
I hated that more than you
sleeping naked with that woman.

642
00:53:45,149 --> 00:53:48,050
It's what Mom can't give
you. You shouldn't do that.

643
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:02,000
I'm sorry, Father. I'll call you.

644
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:03,560
Okay.

645
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:04,129
What's wrong with this?

646
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:05,930
Shall we go?

647
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,360
I'm coming.

648
00:55:10,399 --> 00:55:13,300
The prognosis isn't too bad.

649
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:15,240
What will you do?

650
00:55:16,069 --> 00:55:18,769
I'll just have the surgery
to remove the cyst.

651
00:55:19,269 --> 00:55:20,980
I'd like it done by a laparoscope.

652
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,339
That's possible.

653
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:26,949
May I ask if,

654
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:28,879
after the surgery,

655
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:31,790
I can get a consult about
trying to get pregnant?

656
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:35,819
I must say it'll be hard
to get pregnant naturally.

657
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:37,189
If you want,

658
00:55:37,189 --> 00:55:39,790
I can recommend an infertility expert.

659
00:55:39,889 --> 00:55:42,060
Why don't you set a date for your surgery,

660
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:44,329
and then get an in-depth consultation?

661
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:46,529
Okay.

662
00:55:53,439 --> 00:55:55,209
What do you think, honey?

663
00:55:55,439 --> 00:55:57,649
Why did you suddenly bring that up?

664
00:55:57,649 --> 00:55:58,949
Without telling me?

665
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,550
It was too sudden at the time,

666
00:56:04,649 --> 00:56:06,149
so I felt awkward.

667
00:56:06,149 --> 00:56:08,060
I thought about it and realized that...

668
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:09,560
if we're to have kids,

669
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:12,060
this might be our last chance.

670
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,699
What chance?

671
00:56:16,199 --> 00:56:18,430
We never even considered getting pregnant.

672
00:56:19,529 --> 00:56:21,439
That's why we're thinking about it now.

673
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:23,569
You want to be a dad.

674
00:56:25,009 --> 00:56:26,310
Well...

675
00:56:28,339 --> 00:56:31,350
If I can't get pregnant naturally,

676
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,310
should we consider IVF?

677
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:35,720
It's not a decision to make so easily.

678
00:56:36,649 --> 00:56:38,289
Do you really want a baby?

679
00:56:48,529 --> 00:56:49,899
Are you...

680
00:56:50,629 --> 00:56:52,269
happy with me?

681
00:56:53,899 --> 00:56:55,700
What kind of question is that?

682
00:56:56,299 --> 00:56:59,340
Of course, I'm happy. Why, are you not?

683
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,240
No, it's not that.

684
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:04,350
If we have a kid,

685
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:06,409
it makes us a family, not a couple.

686
00:57:06,409 --> 00:57:08,019
We're a family right now.

687
00:57:08,019 --> 00:57:09,720
That's not what I mean.

688
00:57:10,679 --> 00:57:12,389
Artificial insemination and IVF...

689
00:57:12,389 --> 00:57:14,090
aren't easy procedures.

690
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:15,990
There can be side-effects,

691
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:18,889
and it'll take a toll on your
health and it'll exhaust you.

692
00:57:19,129 --> 00:57:20,659
How will you deal with that?

693
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,669
The furniture that...

694
00:57:32,309 --> 00:57:34,279
Ji Sung hired you to buy.

695
00:57:36,179 --> 00:57:38,250
Why don't you try making it?

696
00:57:40,309 --> 00:57:41,379
Me?

697
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,750
You can be the main manufacturer.

698
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:47,049
I'll help in any way I can.

699
00:57:48,919 --> 00:57:50,590
Are you sure about that?

700
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,429
Why can't we do it? You
used to make furniture too.

701
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:57,629
Shall I, then?

702
00:57:59,299 --> 00:58:00,870
It's been a while.

703
00:58:19,049 --> 00:58:20,450
Who is it this early?

704
00:58:27,529 --> 00:58:28,700
Hello?

705
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:31,299
Yes.

706
00:58:33,269 --> 00:58:34,870
I'll ask.

707
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:36,639
I'm sure it'll be okay.

708
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:39,769
Bye.

709
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:43,710
Who was it?

710
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,879
Myung Woon, our senior.

711
00:58:48,019 --> 00:58:49,279
Han Myung Woon?

712
00:58:50,519 --> 00:58:53,549
He wants to meet for a meal
if we're free this weekend.

713
00:58:54,289 --> 00:58:57,120
Okay, let's do that. Are you up for it?

714
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:02,659
Hwa Ran's not doing too well.

715
00:59:03,429 --> 00:59:04,500
What?

716
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,129
Never mind.

717
00:59:39,929 --> 00:59:41,269
Hello.

718
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:42,470
Hi.

719
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,740
Did the chat go well?

720
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:51,210
She seems to have great
ideas about the interior.

721
00:59:51,779 --> 00:59:55,350
She decided to let us make
all the furniture by hand.

722
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:58,190
That's great.

723
00:59:58,389 --> 00:59:59,990
Did Mr. Woo go out?

724
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:02,360
He left to go to a hospital.

725
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,690
To visit someone who's sick, I think.

726
01:00:06,529 --> 01:00:08,230
Did he not say where?

727
01:00:08,399 --> 01:00:10,429
He told me while he was on the phone.

728
01:00:10,429 --> 01:00:13,830
- Shall I call him?
- No. Don't, it's fine.

729
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,509
CALL HISTORY

730
01:00:23,509 --> 01:00:24,549
HONEY

731
01:00:46,169 --> 01:00:47,740
Are the exams done?

732
01:00:49,539 --> 01:00:51,840
I shouldn't waste your precious time.

733
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:54,110
I'm not that busy. Let's
have something to eat.

734
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,580
Okay. Let me get changed first.

735
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:21,440
Why are you out here?

736
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:24,740
Where did you go without telling me?

737
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:26,539
What's wrong? It's cold, let's talk inside.

738
01:01:26,539 --> 01:01:27,940
Where were you?

739
01:01:28,779 --> 01:01:30,179
At a hospital.

740
01:01:30,379 --> 01:01:31,710
What for?

741
01:01:33,279 --> 01:01:35,779
Your father's physical.
I told you it's today.

742
01:01:36,279 --> 01:01:38,549
I told you two days ago
too, so I thought you knew.

743
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:41,190
Was that today?

744
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:46,059
Shouldn't you have told Ms. Jang, though?

745
01:01:46,059 --> 01:01:48,100
Why you're leaving and when you'll come back.

746
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:58,769
I'll go and visit Dad.

747
01:02:00,009 --> 01:02:02,009
Your father? Right now?

748
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:04,750
Yes. It's the weekend tomorrow.

749
01:02:05,710 --> 01:02:06,809
Let's go.

750
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:09,519
No. I'll go on my own.

751
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:12,019
- It's dangerous to drive at night.
- I'll take a taxi.

752
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:13,889
Why take a taxi alone at night?

753
01:02:13,889 --> 01:02:16,220
- I'll come with you.
- I don't want you to.

754
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,460
I'll just drop you off, then.

755
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:34,440
When will you come back home?

756
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:36,240
Will you spend the night?

757
01:02:36,409 --> 01:02:38,250
- I'll see.
- Your father.

758
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:42,480
He tried to hide it, but he's
worried about his results.

759
01:02:43,379 --> 01:02:45,950
Have a nice chat. He'll
be pleased to see you.

760
01:02:46,919 --> 01:02:47,990
Okay.

761
01:02:57,730 --> 01:02:59,529
Hello? Yes.

762
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,340
Then let them...

763
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,710
Who is it?

764
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:07,039
Just a moment.

765
01:03:07,139 --> 01:03:08,840
It's Ms. Jang. What's wrong?

766
01:03:10,779 --> 01:03:11,879
Nothing.

767
01:03:13,309 --> 01:03:14,519
Go on inside.

768
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,679
Yes, go on.

769
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:19,690
No, I will...

770
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:22,159
Yes, make a call.

771
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,659
Thank you.

772
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:36,399
Do you have soju?

773
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,070
My husband has a woman.

774
01:04:12,669 --> 01:04:13,970
No way.

775
01:04:14,269 --> 01:04:15,779
I saw.

776
01:04:18,049 --> 01:04:19,750
In the middle of the night,

777
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,779
he got up and left without making a sound.

778
01:04:26,049 --> 01:04:27,919
So I followed him.

779
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:34,460
She called him to the
ER at the crack of dawn.

780
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:37,970
She wasn't sick.

781
01:04:38,629 --> 01:04:39,970
She looked fine.

782
01:04:41,399 --> 01:04:43,440
So why did she call my husband?

783
01:04:45,269 --> 01:04:47,539
I'm sure it's nothing. It's just...

784
01:04:47,539 --> 01:04:50,539
Cheating isn't just
sleeping with someone else.

785
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:53,509
He was so worried for her
and felt pity for her.

786
01:04:53,509 --> 01:04:55,320
If that's not love, what is?

787
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:58,750
In the middle of the night, I
didn't even hear his phone ring,

788
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:01,620
but he left to go to her because she called!

789
01:05:02,019 --> 01:05:04,730
What is that? What is that about?

790
01:05:09,130 --> 01:05:10,529
Let's go to your place.

791
01:05:10,930 --> 01:05:13,200
- Go and...
- And say what?

792
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,470
That you know because you've done it?

793
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:21,440
Did you show that you know?

794
01:05:22,839 --> 01:05:24,410
I didn't say anything.

795
01:05:24,410 --> 01:05:27,309
What'll you do if you don't?

796
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:30,619
I'll pretend that I don't know anything.

797
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:36,089
I'll keep it deep inside...

798
01:05:37,289 --> 01:05:38,430
and move on.

799
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:40,289
That's easier said than done.

800
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:43,200
Ask him about it and talk about it.

801
01:05:44,329 --> 01:05:45,670
Wouldn't that be better?

802
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:46,930
How?

803
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:49,099
What should I say?

804
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,009
It'll be over, then. That
means I want to end it!

805
01:05:53,769 --> 01:05:55,539
You can't live like that.

806
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:03,250
My temper flares up a several times a day.

807
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,589
I can't bear it.

808
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:10,519
How am I to bear it each time?

809
01:06:15,299 --> 01:06:16,730
Each time,

810
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:21,440
my heart gets cut.

811
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:26,940
It gets shaved down like a block of wood.

812
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:29,779
It hurts so much.

813
01:06:37,779 --> 01:06:39,319
How am I going to live like this?

814
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:58,670
Hello, sir. Come this way.

815
01:07:00,069 --> 01:07:03,279
That won't work. We must
finish by the end of the month.

816
01:07:04,109 --> 01:07:06,309
Okay. I'll come right over.

817
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:08,549
What's wrong?

818
01:07:08,549 --> 01:07:11,490
There was a miscommunication with
the import company. I must go.

819
01:07:11,490 --> 01:07:13,650
I'll come with you. Let's tell Myung Woon...

820
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:16,119
No, you go ahead. We came all this way.

821
01:07:16,289 --> 01:07:18,430
Tell Myung Woon for me.

822
01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:27,730
I'm sorry. Woon Beom came all the way here,

823
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:29,200
but left on urgent business.

824
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,099
He couldn't even say hi.

825
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:35,210
I was hoping to see you alone, Chung Kyung.

826
01:07:35,339 --> 01:07:36,710
This worked out even better.

827
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:40,079
I'd always wanted to...

828
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:42,920
speak to you freely one day.

829
01:07:44,349 --> 01:07:46,890
It was good to see you again.

830
01:07:47,819 --> 01:07:50,759
Did something happen recently?

831
01:07:52,289 --> 01:07:55,200
Not really. What could happen?

832
01:07:56,359 --> 01:07:59,269
My wife doesn't exactly
make you feel comfortable.

833
01:08:00,029 --> 01:08:01,369
She stresses you out.

834
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:08,210
She put you through something
you didn't have to suffer for.

835
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:11,079
I suffered?

836
01:08:11,079 --> 01:08:12,750
It's my fault.

837
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:15,650
Let me apologize instead.

838
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:17,920
But don't worry too much.

839
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:20,349
No one crossed the line.

840
01:08:21,519 --> 01:08:23,460
They don't have that kind of relationship.

841
01:08:23,890 --> 01:08:25,759
How long have you known?

842
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:29,460
Or rather, how much do you know?

843
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,470
Hwa Ran really wanted to have a baby.

844
01:08:32,769 --> 01:08:34,470
We tried everything we could.

845
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:38,410
IVF didn't work for her.

846
01:08:38,569 --> 01:08:40,369
There were some side-effects.

847
01:08:40,609 --> 01:08:42,210
It was a physical drainer,

848
01:08:42,339 --> 01:08:44,609
but she was mentally drained too.

849
01:08:47,009 --> 01:08:50,920
She'd pass out all the time
and go to the hospital often.

850
01:08:54,490 --> 01:08:56,259
It exhausted me too,

851
01:08:56,589 --> 01:08:58,329
and I wasn't always available.

852
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:04,630
A few times, I got a call much later.

853
01:09:05,599 --> 01:09:06,700
Then...

854
01:09:11,869 --> 01:09:14,369
she stopped calling me altogether.

855
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:16,940
I guess she called Woon Beom.

856
01:09:17,809 --> 01:09:19,549
The hospital she goes to.

857
01:09:19,549 --> 01:09:21,779
I know a doctor there and he told me.

858
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:25,150
Hwa Ran knows that but still goes there.

859
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:26,920
So each time,

860
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,859
she used my husband?

861
01:09:29,859 --> 01:09:32,589
So you'd notice? And get jealous?

862
01:09:34,259 --> 01:09:35,460
So what?

863
01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:37,960
Did you ask to meet to say that?

864
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:40,430
No. That's not it.

865
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:45,069
I just wanted to see you, Chung Kyung.

866
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:46,910
How could you be...

867
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:48,440
We're both so selfish, right?

868
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:52,079
I didn't know you were like this.

869
01:09:52,779 --> 01:09:54,210
- I used to...
- Like me.

870
01:09:54,210 --> 01:09:55,579
I respected you.

871
01:10:00,849 --> 01:10:02,160
I'm really sorry.

872
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:05,890
Woon Beom's such a fool.

873
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:07,589
He has you for a wife, so why...

874
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:13,200
One reason marriage is boring...

875
01:10:14,730 --> 01:10:16,670
is that when you go from dating...

876
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:19,269
to a married couple and live as a family,

877
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,640
you get no more opportunities
to rationally see...

878
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,480
what a catch you are.

879
01:10:28,009 --> 01:10:29,619
You're still beautiful.

880
01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:34,150
Shall I help you?

881
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:37,059
With what?

882
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:41,259
Create a balance.

883
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:50,269
Even if it's just once,

884
01:10:51,170 --> 01:10:53,410
once you betray Woon Beom,

885
01:10:53,539 --> 01:10:55,180
you'll be able to live with it.

886
01:11:11,890 --> 01:11:13,029
Hello?

887
01:11:15,029 --> 01:11:17,460
No. I'll go straight to the hospital.

888
01:11:23,170 --> 01:11:24,700
I'm sorry to cut things short.

889
01:11:25,609 --> 01:11:27,039
Will you come with me?

890
01:11:28,039 --> 01:11:32,779
EMERGENCY CENTER

891
01:11:34,609 --> 01:11:36,220
I should go now.

892
01:11:37,019 --> 01:11:39,619
Oh. Okay, then.

893
01:11:40,549 --> 01:11:43,759
Let's meet properly next
time. Just the two of us.

894
01:11:46,789 --> 01:11:48,859
EMERGENCY CENTER

895
01:11:59,869 --> 01:12:01,039
Are you all right?

896
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,349
I look all right to you, don't I?

897
01:12:06,779 --> 01:12:08,920
I look fine, right?

898
01:12:11,349 --> 01:12:12,690
What did I say?

899
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:14,990
I said today is an important day.

900
01:12:14,990 --> 01:12:16,720
I said I ovulate today!

901
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:18,119
How many times must I say?

902
01:12:18,119 --> 01:12:21,160
How many times must I say it
for you to get the message?

903
01:12:23,299 --> 01:12:24,599
Are you disregarding me?

904
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:28,670
Am I a nobody to you? Do I mean nothing?

905
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,099
How many times must I tell you?

906
01:12:32,339 --> 01:12:35,509
Are you belittling me? How dare you!

907
01:12:50,819 --> 01:12:51,960
You're home.

908
01:12:52,559 --> 01:12:53,789
Look at that.

909
01:12:56,359 --> 01:12:57,730
Seriously.

910
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:01,269
When did you get home?

911
01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:03,670
I came right home after the meeting.

912
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:06,339
Did you work things out?

913
01:13:06,339 --> 01:13:08,140
Yes. We put the order in again right away,

914
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:09,680
so we'll be able to meet the deadline.

915
01:13:10,839 --> 01:13:12,609
I guess it wasn't that urgent.

916
01:13:12,609 --> 01:13:14,150
Yes, it was.

917
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,519
I went right away and took
care of it, that's why.

918
01:13:28,230 --> 01:13:31,000
You didn't want to see Myung Woon, did you?

919
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,769
Why do you say that?

920
01:13:33,769 --> 01:13:35,700
If you didn't want to go in the first place,

921
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:38,140
you shouldn't have made plans. What is this?

922
01:13:41,410 --> 01:13:42,779
That's not it.

923
01:13:42,779 --> 01:13:44,440
Yes, it is.

924
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:45,910
Then you would've come back,

925
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:47,880
not sit here laughing at the TV.

926
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:50,619
Seriously.

927
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:57,119
Your wife was eating alone with another man.

928
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,859
How could you not call or text once?

929
01:14:00,730 --> 01:14:03,430
Is it that much fun watching
TV? How can you drink right now?

930
01:14:04,299 --> 01:14:06,799
What's wrong with you? It
was Myung Woon of all people.

931
01:14:06,799 --> 01:14:08,769
You don't have to worry if it's Myung Woon?

932
01:14:09,039 --> 01:14:10,900
Why? Based on what?

933
01:14:13,769 --> 01:14:16,539
What's wrong? Did something happen?

934
01:14:50,839 --> 01:14:52,779
Enough already!

935
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:55,950
Chung Kyung.

936
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:05,789
Do you even sleep at night?

937
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:10,059
Can you sleep while waiting for
texts on your silenced phone?

938
01:15:11,059 --> 01:15:13,869
I silenced it so it wouldn't wake you.

939
01:15:13,869 --> 01:15:15,369
In case I'd wake up?

940
01:15:16,369 --> 01:15:18,269
Not in case I'd find out?

941
01:15:19,809 --> 01:15:22,480
What misconception do you have?

942
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,109
A few days ago...

943
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:26,549
You got a text.

944
01:15:26,549 --> 01:15:28,819
And you got up and texted back immediately!

945
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:31,619
It's strange! And suspicious!

946
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:34,650
Why didn't you ask right away?

947
01:15:37,789 --> 01:15:38,990
Who was it?

948
01:15:40,859 --> 01:15:43,099
Hwa Ran. Myung Woon's wife.

949
01:15:44,029 --> 01:15:45,369
Why did...

950
01:15:46,799 --> 01:15:49,240
Hwa Ran call you in the middle of the night?

951
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:52,539
I think she's depressed.

952
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:56,880
She has no one to talk to, so I feel bad.

953
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:58,980
Is that all?

954
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:02,720
What do you mean? What else would it be?

955
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:26,170
Honey.

956
01:16:27,009 --> 01:16:29,609
Honey! Honey!

957
01:16:37,579 --> 01:16:40,019
Didn't you see this? It split.

958
01:16:40,150 --> 01:16:41,619
I didn't see it.

959
01:16:43,759 --> 01:16:46,730
I'll do it. We don't have any extras, right?

960
01:16:48,730 --> 01:16:50,259
You have a guest.

961
01:16:50,430 --> 01:16:51,460
Okay.

962
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,000
Stay here. I'll go.

963
01:17:05,279 --> 01:17:06,579
Chung Kyung.

964
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:08,819
It's so good to see you.

965
01:17:10,650 --> 01:17:12,390
I've missed you.

966
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:17,019
I begged Ji Sung because I wanted to see you.

967
01:17:17,619 --> 01:17:19,490
What's wrong with her?

968
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:21,359
She even requested furniture from you,

969
01:17:21,359 --> 01:17:23,599
but she lied that she
didn't have your number.

970
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,329
Why? Did you not want me...

971
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:30,039
to contact you?

972
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:44,220
It's good to see you. It has been a while.

973
01:17:44,950 --> 01:17:46,019
Hello.

974
01:17:50,359 --> 01:17:52,089
What brings you here?

975
01:17:54,630 --> 01:17:56,160
What do you mean?

976
01:17:56,230 --> 01:17:58,700
I wanted to order a dresser.

977
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:00,400
For my husband's study.

978
01:18:00,730 --> 01:18:03,170
He has a lot of things lying around.

979
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:04,940
We apologize,

980
01:18:05,569 --> 01:18:08,539
but we don't have time
to take any more orders.

981
01:18:09,839 --> 01:18:11,880
I'm not in a rush.

982
01:18:12,109 --> 01:18:13,910
I can wait.

983
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:15,180
I'll just preorder it.

984
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:16,319
No.

985
01:18:17,019 --> 01:18:18,650
We can't take any.

986
01:18:20,119 --> 01:18:22,660
We have a lot of orders backed up.

987
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:24,690
We're short-staffed,

988
01:18:24,690 --> 01:18:26,390
so we can't take on that much work.

989
01:18:32,029 --> 01:18:34,200
I'm so hurt, Chung Kyung.

990
01:18:34,430 --> 01:18:36,900
I've missed you a lot.

991
01:18:38,809 --> 01:18:40,309
You've changed.

992
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:43,339
You used to do anything for me.

993
01:18:46,109 --> 01:18:51,650
I should've told you
about our schedule first.

994
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:54,390
Please call in advance next time
so you don't come for nothing.

995
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:55,690
I'm sorry.

996
01:18:56,289 --> 01:18:57,460
I'm sorry.

997
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,190
We can't do it.

998
01:19:05,599 --> 01:19:07,670
Our number's written there.

999
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:10,240
Please call us.

1000
01:19:24,650 --> 01:19:26,990
Do you still say it's nothing? Do you?

1001
01:19:28,150 --> 01:19:30,059
What is it? Why is she here?

1002
01:19:30,059 --> 01:19:31,789
Why did she come here?

1003
01:19:32,930 --> 01:19:34,789
I don't know. I know nothing about it.

1004
01:19:34,890 --> 01:19:36,500
I haven't taken her calls since.

1005
01:19:38,299 --> 01:19:40,069
Is there really nothing between you two?

1006
01:19:40,299 --> 01:19:41,769
I'll be rational.

1007
01:19:41,769 --> 01:19:43,400
She called a married man in
the middle of the night...

1008
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,369
and had the nerve to show up here.

1009
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:48,039
Why should I care what you
did with someone like that?

1010
01:19:49,109 --> 01:19:50,940
- Stop that.
- Stop what?

1011
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:53,079
I'm sorry for making you get the wrong idea,

1012
01:19:53,079 --> 01:19:55,309
but she's not like that. So
don't talk about her like that.

1013
01:19:55,309 --> 01:19:57,750
- What is she like, then?
- Not the type you think...

1014
01:19:58,890 --> 01:20:01,490
Nothing happened, and
there's nothing between us.

1015
01:20:01,490 --> 01:20:03,190
So don't say things like that.

1016
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:25,339
- Hello?
- It's me, Hwa Ran.

1017
01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:28,549
Woon Beom...

1018
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:31,380
Your husband...

1019
01:20:32,390 --> 01:20:33,920
loves me.

1020
01:20:37,190 --> 01:20:38,930
I'm sorry, Chung Kyung.

1021
01:20:40,259 --> 01:20:42,960
This is what I went to
tell you, but I couldn't.

1022
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:48,470
Let's grab some food together.

1023
01:20:48,799 --> 01:20:50,539
I want to apologize.

1024
01:21:25,609 --> 01:21:27,440
How long have you known?

1025
01:21:28,009 --> 01:21:29,680
You knew from the start, didn't you?

1026
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:32,450
You were testing my reaction
by saying those things.

1027
01:21:32,910 --> 01:21:34,180
Was it fun?

1028
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:37,549
That's why I'm sitting here,

1029
01:21:37,549 --> 01:21:38,779
don't you think?

1030
01:21:40,450 --> 01:21:44,019
But it is a bit of a pain
to get involved like this.

1031
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:46,059
You don't look like it.

1032
01:21:46,859 --> 01:21:48,759
You gave her my number...

1033
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,460
and knew she'd come to my workshop.

1034
01:21:51,759 --> 01:21:52,970
Weren't you after that?

1035
01:21:52,970 --> 01:21:55,029
I don't have that much time to kill.

1036
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,769
I had no choice but to tell
her because she kept nagging.

1037
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:59,539
You two are the same.

1038
01:21:59,769 --> 01:22:02,579
You pretended not to know and tested me.

1039
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,109
Hwa Ran toyed with my
husband's emotions for years,

1040
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:07,250
then called me directly...

1041
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:09,049
and asked me to meet.

1042
01:22:09,049 --> 01:22:10,980
And yet, you came.

1043
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:13,650
Because she'll keep contacting
my husband if I don't.

1044
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:16,019
We should end that today.

1045
01:22:16,789 --> 01:22:18,590
I guess you don't want to get divorced?

1046
01:22:18,929 --> 01:22:20,329
Why should I?

1047
01:22:20,989 --> 01:22:22,030
Sure.

1048
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:24,460
Holding out is winning.

1049
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:26,000
Chung Kyung

1050
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:35,309
Chung Kyung. I'm sorry.

1051
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:37,840
I'm so sorry.

1052
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:46,750
For what?

1053
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:49,119
It was too hard for me.

1054
01:22:49,619 --> 01:22:52,090
You know. I'm not strong like you.

1055
01:22:52,289 --> 01:22:54,360
I can't do anything on my own.

1056
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:58,159
And... I was too scared.

1057
01:22:58,659 --> 01:22:59,969
I had no choice.

1058
01:22:59,969 --> 01:23:03,039
But you know, nothing happened.

1059
01:23:03,670 --> 01:23:05,969
What's the standard for that "nothing"?

1060
01:23:07,039 --> 01:23:09,340
I love my husband too much.

1061
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,179
I'm not the type that
can sleep with other men.

1062
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:16,420
It's just... When it got too hard for me,

1063
01:23:17,150 --> 01:23:18,579
I just...

1064
01:23:19,989 --> 01:23:21,889
couldn't handle it.

1065
01:23:21,889 --> 01:23:22,960
So?

1066
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:25,760
Every time you didn't feel
well or got depressed,

1067
01:23:27,090 --> 01:23:29,360
you sought my husband who
responded and came running...

1068
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:31,099
whenever you contacted him?

1069
01:23:34,099 --> 01:23:36,039
You must be very angry.

1070
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:38,000
I'm not angry.

1071
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,670
Don't lie.

1072
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:41,809
How could you not be?

1073
01:23:42,070 --> 01:23:43,679
I'm the one who's sorry.

1074
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:47,010
- For what?
- I knew everything.

1075
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:48,780
That...

1076
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:51,920
he went to the hospital
whenever you ended up there.

1077
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:55,719
That he took your calls and
responded to your texts...

1078
01:23:56,289 --> 01:23:59,090
even if it was in the middle of the night.

1079
01:24:00,730 --> 01:24:02,329
I knew about it all.

1080
01:24:06,599 --> 01:24:08,630
Since when?

1081
01:24:09,739 --> 01:24:11,869
Since the beginning, naturally.

1082
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:15,239
He tells me everything.

1083
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:18,110
I told him to do it.

1084
01:24:18,909 --> 01:24:20,449
To go to you.

1085
01:24:22,650 --> 01:24:24,519
That's not possible.

1086
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:29,460
You sat back and watched your
husband love another woman?

1087
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:34,360
How is that possible?

1088
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:36,059
It isn't love.

1089
01:24:37,099 --> 01:24:38,559
It's pity.

1090
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,630
Because we felt sorry for you.

1091
01:24:41,929 --> 01:24:43,670
I felt bad for you...

1092
01:24:46,110 --> 01:24:48,440
so I told my husband to do that.

1093
01:24:50,610 --> 01:24:52,650
But don't contact him anymore.

1094
01:24:54,449 --> 01:24:56,219
There's just so much pity
we can have for someone.

1095
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,420
My husband and I are both exhausted.

1096
01:25:00,449 --> 01:25:01,889
If you want to vent...

1097
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:04,659
or beg for attention,

1098
01:25:06,059 --> 01:25:07,960
do it to your husband.

1099
01:25:36,789 --> 01:25:37,889
You're back.

1100
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,340
I met with Hwa Ran today.

1101
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,880
She asked me to meet.

1102
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:01,409
She wanted to apologize.

1103
01:26:03,179 --> 01:26:04,880
She said that my husband...

1104
01:26:07,489 --> 01:26:09,590
That you love her...

1105
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:12,530
and that she's sorry.

1106
01:26:13,159 --> 01:26:14,889
What the...

1107
01:26:15,429 --> 01:26:16,630
Is she wrong?

1108
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:19,000
That's absurd.

1109
01:26:20,570 --> 01:26:22,639
I went to the ER that day.

1110
01:26:29,039 --> 01:26:31,710
I saw you standing there next to Hwa Ran.

1111
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:35,150
I followed you and saw everything.

1112
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,150
Then you must know.

1113
01:26:40,590 --> 01:26:41,920
Nothing happened.

1114
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,760
She had no guardian, so I...

1115
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,090
There were no feelings involved?

1116
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:48,530
What you saw was everything.

1117
01:26:51,159 --> 01:26:53,269
You really don't know, do you?

1118
01:26:53,969 --> 01:26:56,840
You don't know how your
face looked back then.

1119
01:26:59,070 --> 01:27:01,340
You should've just slept with her.

1120
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,340
What was that?

1121
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:06,280
How can you say there
were no feelings involved?

1122
01:27:06,679 --> 01:27:09,550
- Chung Kyung.
- Why you?

1123
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:12,320
How could you...

1124
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:14,550
or all people?

1125
01:27:14,619 --> 01:27:16,590
Why are you doing this to me?

1126
01:27:16,590 --> 01:27:18,690
Why are you making me feel so pathetic?

1127
01:27:18,690 --> 01:27:22,130
How could you do this to me? How could you?

1128
01:27:23,329 --> 01:27:25,159
How could you?

1129
01:27:39,179 --> 01:27:41,809
Please, don't do this.

1130
01:27:43,349 --> 01:27:44,820
Where are you going?

1131
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:48,849
It's not that big a deal.
There's no reason for this.

1132
01:27:50,590 --> 01:27:52,829
That's not for you to decern.

1133
01:28:03,969 --> 01:28:05,239
Hello, Father.

1134
01:28:21,719 --> 01:28:23,190
HAN MYUNG WOON

1135
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:33,730
Hello?

1136
01:28:34,630 --> 01:28:35,769
What are you doing?

1137
01:28:39,909 --> 01:28:41,340
Nothing.

1138
01:28:43,010 --> 01:28:44,880
Want to have some wine?

1139
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,190
Right now?

1140
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:56,019
Is it too late?

1141
01:28:59,219 --> 01:29:00,630
No. I'll come.

1142
01:29:05,599 --> 01:29:06,730
EAST HILLS UNIT 2401

1143
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,159
Why do you need a place like
this when you have a home?

1144
01:29:40,369 --> 01:29:42,869
It's good to have secrets from your spouse.

1145
01:29:43,699 --> 01:29:45,369
It's more comfortable that way.

1146
01:29:46,869 --> 01:29:48,610
What kind of marriage is that?

1147
01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:52,780
Who cares?

1148
01:29:59,019 --> 01:30:00,289
I guess.

1149
01:30:02,889 --> 01:30:04,559
Who cares?

1150
01:30:06,559 --> 01:30:08,059
What do you want to do?

1151
01:30:10,659 --> 01:30:12,360
You said you'd help me, right?

1152
01:31:25,099 --> 01:31:26,210
Father!

1153
01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:31,480
Father!

1154
01:31:33,150 --> 01:31:34,250
Father!

1155
01:31:34,909 --> 01:31:37,579
Father. Father.

1156
01:31:39,119 --> 01:31:41,920
Father! Wake up.

1157
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,090
Father! Wake up!

1158
01:31:48,090 --> 01:31:49,159
Father!

1159
01:31:51,460 --> 01:31:54,130
OPERATING ROOM

1160
01:31:55,699 --> 01:31:57,199
Pick up.

1161
01:31:58,070 --> 01:31:59,670
HONEY

1162
01:32:08,849 --> 01:32:10,219
CHUNG KYUNG

1163
01:32:22,789 --> 01:32:25,829
HONEY

1164
01:32:26,329 --> 01:32:27,369
Where...

1165
01:32:31,670 --> 01:32:33,869
CHUNG KYUNG

1166
01:32:41,079 --> 01:32:42,449
I told you.

1167
01:32:42,579 --> 01:32:45,780
You're still just as pretty, Chung Kyung.

1168
01:34:09,170 --> 01:34:10,699
Wait.

1169
01:34:33,789 --> 01:34:34,860
Why?

1170
01:34:59,690 --> 01:35:03,360
He has his own studio.

1171
01:35:05,460 --> 01:35:08,559
He doesn't know that I know.

1172
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:33,019
You scumbag!

1173
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:02,579
Chung Kyung.

1174
01:36:03,579 --> 01:36:04,820
Chung Kyung.

1175
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:10,119
Open up.

1176
01:36:11,159 --> 01:36:14,530
It's me, Chung Kyung. It's okay, so open up.

1177
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:18,159
Open up. You...

1178
01:36:18,599 --> 01:36:21,070
This isn't the time for this. Father...

1179
01:36:24,769 --> 01:36:25,940
Father...

1180
01:36:26,469 --> 01:36:29,340
passed away. You have to go.

1181
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:33,949
Open up.

1182
01:36:35,050 --> 01:36:37,349
Open this door, Chung Kyung.

1183
01:38:59,860 --> 01:39:03,659
MAY HE REST IN PEACE

1184
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:38,800
Thanks.

1185
01:39:42,130 --> 01:39:44,570
I was able to send my father
off properly thanks to you.

1186
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:52,039
I want a divorce.

1187
01:39:55,409 --> 01:39:56,849
Let's get a divorce.

1188
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:03,559
I have no intention of breaking up with you.

1189
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:07,590
We've seen each other's worst.

1190
01:40:09,889 --> 01:40:12,199
How can we live together?

1191
01:40:20,909 --> 01:40:22,440
We have to live.

1192
01:40:24,079 --> 01:40:25,909
You and I, together.

1193
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:33,019
We're each other's only family.

1194
01:40:38,789 --> 01:40:40,329
Is that possible?

1195
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,599
It'll be hard to forget,

1196
01:40:46,730 --> 01:40:47,969
but still.

1197
01:40:49,670 --> 01:40:51,699
I won't lose you over that.

1198
01:40:54,039 --> 01:40:55,309
How...

1199
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:03,179
will you forgive me?

1200
01:41:04,980 --> 01:41:06,719
It wasn't your fault.

1201
01:41:09,090 --> 01:41:10,619
It was my fault.

1202
01:41:21,829 --> 01:41:23,840
The wounds of the heart that we...

1203
01:41:26,539 --> 01:41:28,710
That you and I gave each other...

1204
01:41:31,039 --> 01:41:32,139
No one...

1205
01:41:34,849 --> 01:41:36,480
but the two of us...

1206
01:41:37,179 --> 01:41:39,019
can make them heal.

1207
01:41:40,889 --> 01:41:42,590
Let's bury them.

1208
01:41:44,420 --> 01:41:46,219
Let's let time heal them.

1209
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:49,989
So let's live together...

1210
01:41:54,769 --> 01:41:57,639
for a long, long time.

1211
01:42:04,139 --> 01:42:05,539
Please do that for me.

1212
01:42:51,519 --> 01:42:52,719
It's snowing.

1213
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:06,800
We have to do it, right?

1214
01:43:18,679 --> 01:43:20,079
Will it snow through the afternoon?

1215
01:43:20,079 --> 01:43:22,389
The meeting is in the afternoon, right?

1216
01:43:22,949 --> 01:43:24,019
Yes.

1217
01:43:24,389 --> 01:43:26,929
I'll drive you. It's dangerous with the snow.

1218
01:43:33,869 --> 01:43:35,000
It tastes good.

1219
01:43:36,130 --> 01:43:37,269
Eat up.

1220
01:44:11,300 --> 01:44:16,269
NUMBER 42 IS OVER.

1221
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:35,159
LOVE SCENE NUMBER
