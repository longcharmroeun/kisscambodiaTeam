and couldn't even remember me.

529
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,299
So-hyun, I know you don't like her either.

530
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,125
I know everything.
You were close, but you had a falling-out.

531
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:48,939
She will never admit that she was bullied.

532
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,169
Look at her now.

533
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:51,069
She can't say anything

534
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,405
and is being framed as the assailant,
but she's staying quiet.

535
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,239
So you just need to pretend...

536
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,635
Hold on.

537
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,379
I don't understand what's going on.

538
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,319

539
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,945
I'll help you understand.

Baek Ho-rang ended your friendship
because she didn't want to show you...

541
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,415
how pathetic she is.

Do you get it now?

543
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:17,929
She was afraid to tell you that
she got beaten up,

544
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:20,395

Hey, we're not kids.

00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,319
Should we see how much it costs?

553
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,385
Yes.

Doesn't it look good?

00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:29,535
[ Didn't you say that you were going to

00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,045
It's just how I feel.

576

It's the only time during the day
that I feel comfortable.

577
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,555
So I'm going to come more often

The more I think about it,
the more unfair it is.

You seemed perfectly fine
after breaking up with me.

586
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,665
- Did I seem like that?
- Yes, very much so.

587
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,375
I did live without any issues

What are you saying, Do Woo-jae.

590

But I wasn't okay at all.

Without you,

00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:57,955
I had no reason to get mad or laugh,
and I...

593
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,485
I wasn't happy about that at all.

That's how I knew for sure.

595
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,295
All the emotions that I shared with you
were special to me.

We might have fought a lot,

but that, in and of itself,

598
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,775
was meaningful.

Hey, Do Woo-jae.

604
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,275
I feel the same way.

605
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:57,815
After we broke up,
I thought about you every day,

606
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,585

I'll try harder too.

608

If you respond slowly,
I'll wait until you answer,

609

So make sure

611
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,265
you don't think about something
and make decisions on your own again.

612
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,595
I'll kill you then.

I have something to say, Woo-jae.

617
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,715
Can we keep the fact that we're together
again a secret for the time being?

618

Why?

619
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,989
The thing is, I went around
talking badly about you,

620
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,855
so I need time to change my tune.

621
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,869
Why are you being so honest?

622
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,165
I didn't talk that badly about you.

623
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,835
Honestly, I told everyone that I would
never get back together with you.

- Hey. Listen to me.

00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,095
I had no idea.

705
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,935
She told me that she'd come back,

706
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,205
then she never talked to me again.

707
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,515
She's terrible, isn't she?

708
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:08,585
That's why I resent her.

709
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:12,315
She shouldn't even have promised.

710
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,995
Maybe she was scared.

711
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:24,335
Because she loves you.

712
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:28,135
She wants to only show you
her best moments.

713
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,575
I get where she's coming from.

714
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:36,875
The more you love someone,

715
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:41,215
the more you want to hide.

716
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,015
I don't know.

717
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,585
I don't get it.

718
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,525
It just sounds like an excuse.

719
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,235
The other person is just hurting
without knowing what's going on,

720
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,935
and that kind of behavior shows
that she doesn't care.

721
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,975
That's why I don't like

722
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,805
people who lie.

723
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:20,985
Sorry I made the talk get so serious.

724
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:22,585
Should we get going now?

725
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,595
I don't think anyone would be watching.

726
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:29,295
Sure. Let's head back.

727
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:50,759
So-hyun! Did you sleep well?

728
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,419
Hello, Jae-yi.

729
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,289
Good morning to you.

730
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:57,425
Why are your eyes so swollen?
Did you not sleep well?

731
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,095
Not really.

732
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,429
I left my charger in my room!

733
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,935
Ho-rang, wait for me here.

734
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,805
[ What are you hiding? ]

735
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,375
Don't dig this deeper.

736
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:17,475
You just need to

737
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,545
see things as they are from your spot.

738
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,485
Ho-rang,

739
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:31,295
pull the luggage in closer.

740
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,395
Don't block the hallway.

741
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:51,680
[ Jeong Hui-su ]

742
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,620
[ Jeong Hui-su, I'll shut up
as you wanted me to. ]

743
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:55,550
[ Jeong Hui-su ]

744
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:55,215
[ But you better stop here too. ]

745
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,529
- I'm so tired.
- I'm sleepy.

746
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:06,725
My hands are so dry.
Does anyone have hand lotion?

747
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:15,505
Thank you.

748
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,745
Why do I feel so tired?

749
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,679
Right? My neck feels stiff.

750
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,075
You did a lot of things.

751
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,315
Didn't you two do
a year's worth of activities?

752
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:31,515
Why are you two still here
if you're so tired?

753
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:35,159
- What?
- I'm waiting for So-hyun,

754
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,355
but what about you two?
Are you waiting for someone?

755
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,369
Well,

756
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:43,599
my way home is in the same direction
as Eun-taek's.

757
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,939
All right.

758
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,865
- What?
- Sure, let's say that.

759
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:50,035
What about you, Jae-yi?

760
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,835
Me?

761
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,345
Well, I...

762
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:57,215
- They're coming!
- I'm leaving now.

763
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,649
I'm going to go first. See you at school.

764
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:00,945
Bye!

765
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,285
She's leaving because she saw Woo-jae.

766
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,989
I'll get going first too.

767
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:09,025
- Okay.
- Bye.

768
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,929
- Are you heading home right away?
- Yes.

769
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:14,169
Do you want to eat before we go?

770
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:16,029
We're eating dinner too.

771
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:17,395
Do you want to go together?

772
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,269
[ Hey! ]

773
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:21,665
I don't mind.

774
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,979
Let's go together, then.

775
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:29,819
Do you want to have pizza?
There's a new pizza place.

776
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:30,779
Let's go.

777
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,915
- Wait for me!
- Let's go.

778
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:37,285
Thank you.

779
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,289
So-hyun, did you sleep early last night?

780
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:41,829
I called you, but you didn't pick up.

781
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:44,195
I slept early because I was tired.

782
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:45,429
What about you, Yu-shin?

783
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,499
I couldn't get in touch with you,

784
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,529
so I went over to his room
and hung out before I slept.

785
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:52,535
Eun-taek, wasn't Woo-jae
also in your room?

786
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,039
Why wasn't he there when I visited?

787
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,235
That's because...

788
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,039
he went out to see Jae-yi.

789
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,649
What are you two doing?

790
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:03,049
You two went that way.
Why did you come back?

791
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:04,779
We came the other way for you.

792
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,349
- No way!
- What? You knew already?

793
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:08,989
You're dating again?

794
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:10,559
How did you guys know?

795
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,159
Woo-jae, did you tell them?

796
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,259
No.

797
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,625
How do they know already?

798
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,365
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

799
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,099
Enjoy.

800
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,205
- Thank you.
- Have this.

801
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,979
Tell me everything. When did this happen?

802
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,309
Exactly. You said that you're never
getting back together again.

803
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:34,249
When did I ever say that?

804
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:36,349
You came to my house and ranted
for a whole hour.

805
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:37,979
You're making stuff up.

806
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,945
This is why I didn't tell you about us!

807
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:43,519
How did you two get back together?

808
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,285
Right. Who suggested it first?

809
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,255
Well,

810
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:50,555
Woo-jae left his cap on the bus,

811
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,495
so I met up with him to give it back.

812
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:56,665
It kind of just happened.

813
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,609
How come none of you are surprised?

814
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:02,939
Am I the only one who didn't know?

815
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,179
Don't you think you're the clueless one?

816
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:08,475
I was so surprised to hear that Eun-taek
has a crush on Ho-rang.

817
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:11,419
Eun-taek, you like her?

818
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,949
What? Since when?

819
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:14,385
I guess you didn't know.

820
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,885
Yu-shin, how did you...

821
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,985
How did you know that he has
a crush on me?

822
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:21,329
Ho-rang!

823
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:24,355
The crush that you've been talking about
all this time is him?

824
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:26,969
- Eat up, Jae-yi.
- Stop!

825
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:29,099
So-hyun is bored. Let's talk
about something else.

826
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:31,239
No, I'm listening.

827
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,405
Congratulations on getting back together.

828
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,835
Thank you, So-hyun.

829
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:37,909
Could we see the menu?

830
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:38,935
Here.

831
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,295
Is everything okay?

832
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,565
Sorry?

833
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,969
You seemed like you weren't eating well.

834
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:06,805
It's nothing.

835
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:11,505
I had no idea that you had a crush
on Ho-rang.

836
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:17,175
You're not disappointed, are you?

837
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,045
Me? Why would I be?

838
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,285
Because you and she have bad blood.

839
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,055
You've told me about that since forever.

840
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:28,355
I told you that that's just between us.

841
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:30,055
I wish

842
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,695
you two the best.

843
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:37,165
Are things between you and Ho-rang
still looking bad?

844
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:38,895
Yes.

845
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,305
I still don't like her.

846
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,635
I'm starting to really not like her,

847
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,075
so I'm going to give myself some space.

848
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,145
That being said,

849
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,915
I think it'd be great if you could
stay with her like you are now.

850
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:56,049
Sorry?

851
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:59,685
I realized today that Ho-rang has
a lot of people looking out for her.

852
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,725
It's a relief.

853
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,929
So-hyun!

854
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:08,765
- Here.
- Thank you.

855
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,769
Where are you all heading?
We're heading downtown.

856
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:15,609
I'm walking So-hyun home.
That's okay with you, right?

857
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:17,635
- What about you two?
- We're heading home.

858
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:20,079
- It's getting late.
- All right, then.

859
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,949
- Goodbye. See you all at school!
- Bye.

860
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:23,679
- Have fun.
- Bye!

861
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,545
Bye!

862
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:26,445
- I'll carry it.
- It's fine.

863
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:30,085
I can carry it.

864
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:42,595
- Let's go.
- Okay!

865
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,665
It's coming soon in three minutes.

866
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,935
Have you scheduled the recording yet?

867
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:51,439
Oh, my. Come on.

868
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,939
I'll do it over the weekend.

869
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:55,005
I thought perhaps,
we could hang out after the recording.

870
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:56,605
Hang out?

871
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,649
Jae-yi asked me the same thing earlier.

872
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:00,185
She wants to hang out over the weekend.

873
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,119
Is there a place you want to go?

874
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,359
Well, it's not exactly a place
I want to go.

875
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,155
But I did look up a place.

876
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:10,995
I got this list from someone.

877
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:23,705
What is it?

878
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:28,745
I'm sorry. You should go without me.

879
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:30,815
What?

880
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,415
Something just came up.

881
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,515

is a sight for sore eyes. ]

1061

[ Is that all you can say ]

1062
01:03:10,344 --> 01:03:12,209
[ to someone who has been waiting for you? ]

- Hey, that's her.
- Who?

1067
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:26,879
The girl who dates a bunch of guys.

1068
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,019
- That's crazy. Are you serious?
- Yes.

1069
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:31,115
- That's her.
- No way.

1070
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:33,045
Hey.

1071
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:36,315
Do you have a lip tint on you?

1072
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:37,355
What? Yes.

1073
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:39,855
Here.

1074
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,725
Do you have a different color?

1075
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:48,435
What about this one?

1076
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:52,839
You only have guy friends, right?

1077
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,839
- What?
- That's what I heard.

1078
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,705
I heard you don't have any girl friends,
and you only hang out with guys.

1079
01:03:58,150 --> 01:04:00,675
Oh, right. The thing is...

1080
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:04,049
I'm more comfortable talking to guys,

1081
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:07,815
but that doesn't mean I feel uncomfortable
talking to girls.

1082
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,415
Why are you making excuses?

1083
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:12,325
That's how people are.

1084
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:15,925
When someone is different from them,
they think that they're weird.

1085
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,899
- Are you dating all of them?
- No!

1086
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:22,565
Then it's not weird that
you have a lot of guy friends.

1087
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:24,965
But

1088
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:27,269
this color is definitely weird.

1089
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:29,105
Nobody would use this.

1090
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:32,275
Is it that bad?

1091
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:41,085
Hey.

1092
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:42,885
Hey, then

1093
01:04:45,830 --> 01:04:47,995
can you come with me to buy some later?

1094
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:54,469
Or you can just tell me
what's a good one to buy.

1095
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:56,465
I'm going to buy a cushion compact
after school.

1096
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:58,805
You can come with me if you want.

1097
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:02,935
Okay.

Hey, are you a good student?
