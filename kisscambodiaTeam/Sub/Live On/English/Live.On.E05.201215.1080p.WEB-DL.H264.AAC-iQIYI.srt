00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,639
After class, the first years

175
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,309
should clean up the remaining equipment
and put them in storage.

176
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,179
- Okay.
- Okay.

177
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,379
Jin-guk and Hui-su, can you go to
the supply room and check the cameras?

178
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,349
- Okay.
- Okay.

179
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,449
Someone needs to clean up the cables
and lights in the auditorium. How about...

180
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,575
I'll do it.

181
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,155
I left early yesterday,
so I'll clean up the auditorium.

182
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,525
There's a lot to do,
so you can't do it alone.

183
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,385
I can do it alone.

184
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,395
Okay.

185
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,199
So-hyun, can you organize the receipts we
received while preparing for the festival?

186
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,265
Okay.

187
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,765
Then I'll end the meeting here.
Good job, guys.

188
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,705
- Good job, everyone.
- Good job, everyone.

189
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,315

190
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,085
Yes?

191
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,665
You can put the cables
in the supply room later.

192
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,165
Right.

193
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,535
Okay.

194
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,619
- Where did you go yesterday?
- What do you mean?

195
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,315
During part two of the festival.
I looked for you, but I couldn't find you.

196
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,325
I left in the middle of it
because it wasn't fun.

197
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,595
Hey. What else should we buy?

198
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,529
You want to buy more?
This is already a lot.

199
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,269
Baek Ho-rang didn't eat before. I want
to get her something while we're here.

200
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,669
- Jae-hee.
- Oh, Woo-sol.

201
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,439
I messaged you on Face earlier.

202
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,469
Hello.

203
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,209
He is...

204
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:13,309
He's in my class. How should I put it?
He's him.

205
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,145
Why would you introduce me like that?

206
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,445
He's a friend.

207
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,275
- Woo-sol is...
- A close friend of Jae-hee's.

208
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,649
Hi. Is your hair naturally brown?

209
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,485
Yes. Is your hair naturally curly?

210
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,659
Yes.

211
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,785
What's this?
What's with this conversation?

212
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,289
Hey, Kim Yu-shin.
Go buy some more food. Hurry.

213
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,999
Okay. I'll see you again, Woo-sol.

214
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,625
Goodbye.

215
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,229
What is this? Is he a new fling?

216
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,269
What? Who? Him?

217
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,599
Oh, gosh. Never.

218
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,439
Gosh, he isn't?

219
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,679
That's why I purposely didn't mention
Do Woo-jae.

220
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,139
I was happy for no reason.

221
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,079
What's there for you to be happy about?

222
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,579
It's just because I want you
to start seeing someone else.

223
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,819
That way, Do Woo-jae will...

224
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,449
- Woo-sol.
- Yes?

225
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,915
I'm sorry,

226
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,715
but I don't want to hear Do Woo-jae's name
for the time being.

227
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,389
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking straight.

228
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,955
From now on, if I need to mention him,
I'll call him "that jerk".

229
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,695
Do you want something to eat? I'll buy.

230
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:12,495
The uncertainty of information.
The information that is spread around us

231
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,505
is in fact...

232
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,435
Hello?

233
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,115
You got prettier, Ho-rang.

234
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,355
Stop glaring at me like that.

235
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,925
Did you eat?

236
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,565
Why did you call me?

237
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,435
My personal information was released
because of you.

238
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,139
I was living perfectly well,

239
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,765
but I had to shut down my account
because of you.

240
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,575
It's really annoying.

241
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,145
Are you asking me

242
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,779
to be considerate of your personal
information when you're the assailant?

243
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,815
My gosh.

244
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,615
You dare to look at me in the eye
just because I was being nice?

245
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,855
Hey, Baek Ho-rang.

246
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,915
Why do you think I called you here?

247
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,485
I'm sure you wanted to ask me
to cover it up.

248
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,759
I'm sure you remember
everything you did too.

249
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,269
Excuse me. First of all, I'm not sure
if it's even that big of a deal.

250
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,635
Also, I have no intention to cover it up.

251
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,969
Covering it up before it gets bigger
only benefits you,

252
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,205
not me.

253
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,935
I'll just get cursed at for a bit,
but it will end.

254
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,275
But that's not the case for you.
Aren't I right?

255
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,025
You're scared right now.

256
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,825
You acted like such a hot shot,

257
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,165
but you're afraid that people will find
out that you're a loser who got beaten up.

258
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,709
Isn't this hilarious?

259
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,905
You're the one who got beaten up,
but you're the one who's scared right now.

260

262

remember everything about the time

263
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,825
you claim to have no memory of.

264
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,325
Every day, when I'm asleep or eating,
I'm reminded of it all of a sudden.

265
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,095
So let me ask you something too.

266
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,705
Why did you

267
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,035
do that to me?

268
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,975
I'm not sure.

269
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,405
I don't really remember,

270
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,985
but it's probably because
you were an easy target.

271
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,359
It's been a while, so I wanted to get
something to eat with you,

272
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,485
but I guess we can't today
because of my part-time job.

273
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,795
There's some left, so you can drink this.

274
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,335
I'll see you again.

important information.

276
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,885
Furthermore,
if you can't obtain information...

277
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,285
What do you think, Ko Eun-taek?

278
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,925
About what?

279
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,025
What happened with Baek Ho-rang.

280
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,395
I'm not sure.

281
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,564
But

282
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,375
don't you think it's too much
for her to clean up by herself?

283
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,805
There are a lot of people
in the auditorium too.

284
00:17:16,979 --> 00:17:18,945
She won't like it if I go,

285
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,245
so I think it would be good for someone
other than me to go.

286
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,854

Yes. There's the filming
for the film festival soon,

today.

00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,569
can you talk to him?

301
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,209
He keeps telling me to get dressed
like an elementary kid for the video.

302
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,949
Who else would do it? You think we can
get an actor just for that role?

303
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,019
Why would you make me do such a thing?

304
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,445
That's because you look the most childish
and cutest.

305

If you've had a fling for a whole year,
it's about time you date.

No, we don't.

from the festival.

I just need to backup the files
on the hard drive, right?

- Hui-su did?
- Yes.

- I knew something was off.

Can I have a seat for a moment?

693
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:26,475
I can't tell which one of us lives here.

694
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:33,949
- What are you doing?
- What do you think?

695
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:36,685
Just watch that. It's hilarious.

696
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,415
Give it back.

697
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,615
I don't want to. I came here,
so you wouldn't look at your phone.

698
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,559
You should go home now.

699
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,029
Why are you annoying me
by coming to my house?

700
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:49,769
Don't you have any place to be
on the weekend?

701
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,865
I don't. You know that we broke up.

702
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:00,339
Oh, right. Why did you meet up
with Do Woo-jae earlier?

703
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,705
He came by to go to the library
with Ko Eun-taek.

704
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,575
I met him by chance too.

705
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:08,119
- Hold on. Something's strange.
- What is?

706
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,789
Do Woo-jae came to see Ko Eun-taek,

707
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:12,245
but how did he see you?

708
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,455
Were the two of you together this morning?

709
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:18,355
Oh, right.

710
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:22,525
There was a situation for that.

711
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:24,225
Really?

712
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,565
But you're lasting
for a long time this time.

713
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:30,565
When will you get back with him?

714
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,739
I'm not getting back with him.
It's for real this time.

715
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,375
For real, my foot.

716
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,515
Are you serious?

717
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:48,185
Yes. I did my best,
so I don't have any lingering feelings.

718
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,725
If anyone should have regrets, it should
be Do Woo-jae, that jerk, not me.

719
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,355
Don't be so sure.

720
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,625
That might have been the best he could do.

721
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,065
I'm just saying that everyone has
different methods.

722
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,465
Also,

723
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,939
you are quite the exhausting type.

724
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:09,209
My gosh. I came here to comfort you.

725
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:11,205
You should be on my side.

726
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:16,585
But how did the two of you meet?

727
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:20,455
We attended the same academy
in middle school.

728
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:23,125
I liked him when I first saw him,
so I talked to him first.

729
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:25,359
What made you fall for him?

730
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,495
No idea.

731
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,759
I guess his looks are my type.

732
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,899
And one more thing.

733
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,195
Even when he's mad, he talks so calmly.

734
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:35,735
That made him look so cool.

735
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,739
Now that I think about it,
there's this one too.

736
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:40,739
We were arguing once when I ran out
of breath, and he brought me water.

737
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,675
Isn't that so sweet of him?

738
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:46,679
You said you don't know, but seems
like you can talk about him for days.

739
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,219
I don't know. I just liked him.

740
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:51,919
It was fun with him even when we weren't
doing anything,

741
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,255
and I felt so comfortable around him.

742

[ Is it too absurd
to talk about movie tickets? ]

743
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,355
No. Well,

744
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:01,155
it's nice to talk about absurd things
once in a while.

745
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,325
Keep going.

746
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:07,565
[ Did you sleep well, Ho-rang? ]

747
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,705
[ I'm glad, though. ]

748
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:12,005
[ You seemed more relaxed than before. ]

749
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:16,975
Did he say anything when you two
were eating?

750
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,309
What? Woo-jae?

751
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:20,449
Yes.

752
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:22,449
No, let's stop talking about him.

753
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:24,119
Let's talk about you. What about you?

754
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,015
Don't you have anyone
you've been messaging with?

755
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,385
What?

756
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:32,689
What's with the reaction?

757
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:34,629
I just said that for fun,
and you fell right for it.

758
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:36,665
What's going on? Do you have someone?

759
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:38,099
No, it's nothing like that.

760
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:39,799
What are you talking about?

761
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,595
You were like this just now.

762
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:45,009
What is it? Who is it? Tell me.

763
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:48,005
So, how long has it been since you had
a crush on Ho-rang?

764
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,905
It hasn't been long since I found out,

765
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:51,349
but it's been a while.

766
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:53,475
Does she know that you like her?

767
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:55,219
Yes, I told her.

768
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:56,919
No way!

769
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,449
It's like the two people you'd
least expect to ever date,

770
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:01,785
so it's even harder to imagine them
together.

771
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,285
But you two look good together.

772
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,595
You must've been so worried about her
when the incident broke out.

773
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,395
Yes, which is why I just called her now
and she didn't pick up.

774
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:13,699
Maybe it's because she's with Jae-yi
right now.

775
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:16,099
Jae-yi? She's with Ho-rang right now?

776
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,569
She asked me for Ho-rang's house address
because she was going over.

777
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:21,175
What? She was so eager to get rid of me.

778
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:26,009
Woo-jae, have you not talked to Jae-yi
since then?

779
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:27,549
No, I haven't.

780
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:28,775
Hey,

781
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:30,989
I couldn't ask because Ho-rang was there,

782
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:33,919
but it clearly seems to me that you two
still have feelings for each other.

783
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,715
So why did you break up?

784
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,655
I felt like if it was going to happen,

785
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,169
it'd be better to break up
when we still have

786
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,969
some good feelings left for each other.

787
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:47,065

- Yes.

She's not coming today.

791
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:56,309
- What?
- She's studying at a cafe today.

792

What? You should've told me earlier!

793

I came here with you two just for So-hyun!

794
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,049
I only came for So-hyun, you know.

795
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:04,615
Why did you have to do that?

796
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:09,189

1038
01:04:36,367 --> 01:04:39,054
[ Live On ]

1039
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:41,259
[ What do you think about Ho-rang? ]

1040
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:44,059
[ Well, I don't know much about her. ]

1041
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:47,265
[ I welcome the students of Seoyeon
High School to their school retreat. ]

1042
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,869
[ By the way, Woo-jae was smiling
when he saw you this afternoon. ]

1043
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:52,135
[ Doesn't this look weird? ]

1044
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:56,109
No. You're pretty.

1045
01:04:56,110 --> 01:04:58,735
[ I needed to check something.
And I was right. ]

1046
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:00,845
[ It was you. ]

1047
01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:03,645
The one who posted Ho-rang's photo.
