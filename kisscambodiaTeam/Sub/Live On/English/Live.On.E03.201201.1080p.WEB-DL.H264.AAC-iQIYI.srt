I ate because I knew you put hard work
into packing that lunch,

I thought you'd be cold...

00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,769
I just have to play audio
from the 1st to the 3rd floor, right?

875
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:31,775
Yes, when I tell you to
over the walkie-talkie.

876
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:33,905
Okay.

877
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:36,475
How do I turn this on?

878
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,485
Press this,

879
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,645
and go like this.

880
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,259
I'll get going now.
I'll send you a signal.

881
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:49,425
Okay.

882
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:57,699
[ Can you hear me? ]

883
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:58,935
Yes, I can.

884
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,569
This is so cool.

885
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:03,709
I guess this is why people use this
instead of their phones.

886
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:04,905
What are you talking about?

887
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:07,875
It's more convenient when you have
to talk to more than one person.

888
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:10,415
I'm on the third floor now. Turn it on.

889
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,045
Okay.

890
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:22,589
You're doing well. No mistakes.
Someone taught you well.

891
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:24,295
No, I'm just a good student.

892
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,025
Eun-taek,

893
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:28,825
how come you're not scolding me today?

894
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:29,929
About what?

895
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:32,639
I didn't go with the script
during the show today.

896
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,265
I thought you'd get mad at me,
but you aren't saying anything.

897
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,075
Good job.

898
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:42,875
What?

899
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:45,719
I was going to say something
if I didn't have to go out in the middle,

900
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,989
but I later realized that it's nothing
I should fret over.

901
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:49,245
[ It wasn't so bad. ]

902
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:50,559
People loved it too.

903
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,689
See?

904
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:55,329
Instead of going exactly by the script

905
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:57,029
like So-hyun and you,

906
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:59,629
sometimes, it's better to be spontaneous
like me.

907
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:01,929
That doesn't mean that you should do this
every time.

908
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:03,369
Next time, tell me in advance. Got it?

909
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:05,165
Yes, I got it.

910
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:10,909
I'm done checking the third floor.
You can turn it off now.

911
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:12,005
Okay.

912
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,375
[ Ho-rang, ]

913
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:24,215
you're right.

914
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,155
Sometimes,

915
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:29,525
unexpected things lead to good results.

916
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:31,695
[ That being said, ]

917
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:34,895
good job on your very first show.

918
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:37,565
I forgot to tell you this earlier.

919
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:19,875
You sent the story

920
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:22,905
for the lunch broadcast, right?

921
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,275
What?

922
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,385
Well, yes.

923
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:30,319
I didn't know it'd get picked.

924
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,015
I just wrote it in the heat of the moment.

925
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,885
And it got picked for the story.

926
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,095
- So I'm trying to say...
- I'm sorry, Jae-yi.

927
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,895
When I listened to the story,

928
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:44,695
I realized this must've been hard on you.

929
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,535
No. It's not like
I didn't have any part in it.

930
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:49,765
Jae-yi.

931
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:51,305
What?

932
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:55,449
Do you remember the first time we met?
When we were in middle school?

933
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:56,945
[ Can I sit here? ]

934
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,545
[ Of course. ]

935
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,415
[ I talked to you first because
I liked you at the prep school. ]

936
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:04,219
[ Back then, you had a straight face on, ]

937
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:06,015
[ so I thought you hated me. ]

938
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:09,359
[ I told you.
It was because I liked you first. ]

939
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:12,455
[ Hey, that was no way to look at
a girl you had a crush on. ]

940
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,465
[ Actually, I was really happy inside ]

941
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:17,439
[ because you sat next to me. ]

942
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,295
[ English Study Questions ]

943
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,205
[ Do you want to
have dinner with me later? ]

944
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:33,515
[ And your handwriting on the note
asking me out for dinner was so cute. ]

945
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,119
When we had our first meal in private,

946
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,955
I loved listening to your stories.

947
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:41,385
Same here.

948
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:44,025
I was grateful that you listened to

949
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,795
all of my stories.

950
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:51,535
I liked you
because you were different from me.

951
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:55,409
It was hard for me to express my feelings.

952
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:58,275
I held them back until I couldn't anymore.
And I barely managed to share it.

953
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:01,075
But you always told me everything.

954
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:07,015
After fighting with you at the Han River,
I had all sorts of thoughts.

955
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:10,245
"I should've suggested
to go there another time."

956
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:13,015
"I should've told her I already ate"

957
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:14,689
"and I didn't feel good."

958
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:17,155
I should have told you how I really felt.

959
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,025
Then, we wouldn't have fought that day.
I regretted it,

960
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:26,995
but this wasn't the first time.

961
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:30,335
What are you trying to say?

962
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:34,005
I liked you because we were so different.

963
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:38,315
But we went through so much pain
because of our differences.

964
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:40,919
- I don't want to listen to you.
- Jae-yi.

965
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,015
Bye.

966
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,525
To cover it up and turn the other way,

967
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,995
we are way too exhausted.

968
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,735
Hey, Woo-jae.

969
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:04,235
That brings me to my next point.

970
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:08,875
We should...

971
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,185
...break up.

972
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,195
That's the right thing to do.

973
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:29,865
Hey. How is that right?

974
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:32,835
I was happy because for the first time,
you opened up to me.

975
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,905
But you want to break up with me?

976
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,135
You're so selfish.

977
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,235
You can't say that

978
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:41,749
all of a sudden.

979
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,075
It didn't happen all of a sudden.

980
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:45,115
Fine. Let's break up.

981
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,215
Like you said, it was a lot for me too.

982
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:51,515
Let's break up.

983
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:09,135
[ I checked it. You can turn it off. ]

984
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:10,709
Are we done then?

985
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:12,875
[ Yes. Good job. I'll go up. ]

986
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:15,005
[ Oh, right. Ho-rang. ]

987
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:17,349
- What?
- I planned to give this in person

988
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:19,475
but you might not like it,
because you might cringe at it.

989
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:22,685
- What is it?
[ - Do you see my bag on the chair? ]

990
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:24,185
[ Open it. ]

991
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:36,125
[ To Baek Ho-rang ]

992
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:49,445
[ I heard it's your birthday soon. ]

993
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:53,315
[ - It's for your birthday.
- Happy birthday! ]

994
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:58,985
[ Ta-da. ]

995
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:01,325
[ It's so childish. ]

996
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,155
[ - Look.
- What is this? ]

997
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,799
[ Happy birthday. ]

998
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,795
[ - Happy birthday.
- Let's do this together. ]

999
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:14,765
[ That got on my clothes. ]

1000
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:21,405
[ Baek Ho-rang. ]

1001
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,705
[ Happy birthday! ]

1002
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:29,885
[ - Baek Ho-rang.
- Happy birthday. ]

[ - Baek Ho-rang.
- Baek Ho-rang. ]

Ho-rang.

1005
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:26,775
Are you okay?

1006
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:57,109

01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:22,105
Yes!

1010
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:26,479
[ So do you think you can make up
with your ex-boyfriend? ]

1011
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,585
Woo-jae.

1012
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:30,049
[ - So-hyun.
- I made myself clear. ]

1013
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:31,119
[ Let's stop. ]

1014
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,259
So-hyun told you to stop calling her.
Don't call her.

1015
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:36,089
[ You said you don't expect much
from people. Am I one of them? ]

1016
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:39,059
I think you might be a bit different.

1017
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:42,325
So this is what I want to tell you.
