I'm glad I waited.

530

I've been waiting the whole day
to hear you say that.

531
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,265
So does it mean

532
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,965
we're officially in a relationship?

533
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:24,935

as the captain of the broadcasting team.

545
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,039
It was beautiful there.

546
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,805
- Right?
- Yes.

547
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,705
Sorry. This won't take long.

548
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,015
I guess everyone is busy
with the video festival.

549
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,415
Yes. It's just around the corner.

550
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,985
Then,

551
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,625
should I join the broadcasting team again?

552
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:14,195
I mean, I've been thinking about this
since yesterday.

553
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,095
It was quite unfair.

554
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:19,105
I stayed up several nights
to prepare for that.

555
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:20,705
Right?

556
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,335
I just wanted to see it through.

557
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,545
With the team.

558
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:31,445
And if I drop out, I'm sure So-hyun
will have to pick up my slack.

559
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,215
I heard you briefly talked to
So-hyun yesterday.

560
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,825
- Yes. Did she tell you that?
- Yes.

561
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,559
She didn't tell you yesterday
because things were hectic for you.

562
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,955
But when I suggested doing
the broadcast for you,

563
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,595
she was relieved.

564
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:50,435
I guess she cares about you
as much as I do.

565
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,365
I know that too.

566
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:58,875
That's why I talked to her yesterday.

567
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,679
But it was crazy yesterday.

568
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,679
And to be honest,
it's still awkward with her.

569
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,385
I will set aside time
and talk to her sometime soon.

570
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,085

what happened to you back then,

00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,485
nothing would have changed.

00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,815
What do you think? Is it okay?

704
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,549
[ I guess it's not bad. ]

705
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,515
[ Not bad? I think it looks pretty good. ]

706
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,245
Did you just get here?

707
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,855
Yes.

708
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:33,185
What do you think? It's been
a while since you've been in here.

709
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,455
I feel like this might have been
a mistake.

710
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,629
Maybe I should've taken a longer break.

711
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,595
You can't leave whenever you want now.

712
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:43,535
Right, Ho-rang.
I'm saying this just in case.

713
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:47,039
Just because I like you, I'm not going to
go easy on you or make it obvious,

714
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,405
so don't be upset.

715
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:51,805
What are you talking about? When did you
ever go easy on me because you liked me?

716
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,209
Even after you told me you liked me,

717
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:55,675
you made such a scene
because I lost the USB.

718
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,045
Here.

719
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,589
What is this?

720
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,719
You said your arm hurt from shaking
your handwarmer.

721
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,915
It's an electronic hand warmer.

722
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:07,725
This is how you use it.

723
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:11,395
Ho-rang!
Did you decide to join the team again?

724
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,099
Yes.

725
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,125
Really? Thank goodness.

726
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,239
You know I was on your side
all along, right?

727
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,269
- Me too.
- Me too.

728
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:20,239
- Me too.
- Stop trying to suck up to her.

729
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,069
I missed Ho-rang.

730
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,435
Thank you both.

731
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,805
You guys too.

732
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,679
Eun-taek, what are you doing over there?

733
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,275
Do we have a broadcast today?

734
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:30,945
What?

735
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,615
Right.

736
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,915
I was doing something for a second.

737
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,115
Let's have our meeting.

738
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,265
Year 2 Class 1, Kang Jae-yi. You're late.

739
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:50,695
You surprised me.

740
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:52,199
I'm glad it was you.

741
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,309
If I get penalty points today,
I have to wash the school walls.

742
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,705
You're getting penalty points.

743
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,075
I already wrote it down.

744
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,109
Why? I'm late because of you.

745
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,115
You should let this go.

746
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,385
How can I let this go?

747
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,019
I was really late
because of our date today.

748
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,115
Look.

749
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:12,985
You look pretty.

750
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,329
But I can't let it go.

751
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:16,855
I prepared for our date too,
but I was early.

752
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,825
What's this? You prepared something?

753
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,429
My gosh. I had no idea.

754
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,635
Hurry up and go in.

755
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,365
I have to stay here and check until 9 a.m.

756
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,339
- Okay. I'll get going then.
- Okay.

757
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,405
Bye.

758
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,645
How cute.

759
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,875
[ As you all know, ]

760
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:41,945
Jeong Hui-su quit the broadcasting team.

761
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:45,789
I didn't expect this from her.
Why did she do that?

762
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:47,455
I heard she's transferring.

763
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:48,955
- Really?
- Yes.

764
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,199
Jeong Hui-su is transferring?

765
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,925
That's what I heard.

766
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:56,865
Just consider it as some bad luck.

767
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:10,545
I heard you're transferring.

768
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:13,645
Yes, I am.

769
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,089
I hope you come to your senses there,

770
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:18,515
so you don't end up like this again.

771
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,185
What did you say?

772
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,695
Being compared to people

773
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:27,825
made you upset too.

774
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:31,695
Stop paying attention to what people think

775
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:36,535
and live a comfortable life.

776
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,745
If it's too hard to do alone,

777
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,845
find someone nice to be by your side.

778
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,915
That's what I'm trying to do.

779
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,015
Did the two of you fight again?

780
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,985
What is it this time?

781
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,655
[ I have to clean the auditorium today. ]

782
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,555
All of a sudden?

783
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,599
We're getting new equipment in the
auditorium, so they want us to clean it.

784
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,025
What is this?
We've already made plans for today.

785
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,809
I guess we have no choice then.

786
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:42,365
Let's do it tomorrow.
It doesn't have to be today.

787
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:46,705
What? Why doesn't it have to be today?

788
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,345
What?

789
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:53,045
Is our 1,000th-day anniversary a day
we can celebrate today or tomorrow?

790
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,485
Is it a meaningless day to you??

791
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:57,385
Our 1,000th-day anniversary?

792
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:01,585
What? Didn't you know today was
our 1,000th-day anniversary?

793
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,699
Isn't that why you said
that you prepared something?

794
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,395
You said you made reservations.

795
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:08,925
That's...

796
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,145
I bought this to give to you,
so accept it.

797
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,175
I'll get going.

798
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,185
Jae-yi.

799
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:30,785
I'll call you later.

800
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:33,225
If I stay any longer,
I'm afraid we might fight again.

801
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:47,165
[ How could he forget our
1,000th-day anniversary? ]

802
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,535
- You said you guys made plans.
- I know.

803
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,049
I thought we did too,
but I guess I was wrong.

804
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,809
That's why I just gave him his gift.

805
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:56,375
I would've been upset too.

806
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,075
What's more upsetting

807
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,245
is that he promised not to do so.

808
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:03,515
But he's staying silent again
and it's frustrating.

809
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,785
So-hyun, not all men are like that,
so don't generalize.

810
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:10,759
Why are you even here?
You don't even have to be.

811
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,429
I'm helping, you know.

812
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:14,169
Then you can take over for me!

813
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:15,595
Why would I do that?

814
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:17,135
I'd do that for So-hyun, though.

815
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:20,705
Goodness.

816
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,935
But I guess the fight wasn't so bad,
right?

817
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,949
No, she's not fuming.

818
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:29,945
No.

819
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:33,915
I said that I wouldn't.
We'll talk it out later.

820
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:37,059
The more I think about it,
the madder I get.

821
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,125
How could he forget?

822
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:41,325
I'm sorry I'm late.

823
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:44,295
What happened? You're never late.

824
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:47,265
What do I have to do?

825
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:52,465
Just move everything over there
to the waiting room.

826
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:53,805
Okay.

827
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,779
So-hyun,

828
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,849
what do you really think of Yu-shin?

829
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:03,749
His feelings for you are
definitely sincere.

830
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:04,845
Look at him.

831
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:09,715
So-hyun, I'm done here. You can just rest.

832
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,559
I don't think she's completely
disinterested either.

833
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,429
Right?

834
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,025
Doesn't she look so relaxed
when she's with Yu-shin?

835
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,025
I do?

836
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:24,335
Yes. We can tell when we're around you.

837
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:27,535
You should really think about it.

838
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:33,375
I think it'd be great if you could date
someone you're interested in for once.

839
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:37,575
Give me a moment.

840
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,855
You can take a break. I'll do it.

841
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,625
I want to finish fast so that I can go
and eat with you after.

842
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:59,065
Why were you late earlier?

843
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:00,735
Sorry?

844
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:03,405
I was on a call.

845
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:05,435
With who?

846
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:08,445
Sorry?

847
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,075
No, nothing.

848
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:16,085
I'll carry this. You carry those.

849
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:28,495
Why is he making me wait?

850
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:40,745
What's this?

851
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,645
Our 1000th-day anniversary present.

852
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:44,649
What?

853
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:48,585
You said that you'd surprise me.
How come it took you so long?

854
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:50,415
I'm sorry.

855
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:52,915
I thought it was next month.

856
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,955
What? Our 1000th-day anniversary?

857
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,055
I didn't count the days
that we were broken up for.

858
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:01,725
That's the 13th of next month.

859
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:07,335
That's why I thought we were
just on a date today.

860
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:09,569
You should've told me.

861
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:11,435
That's why I came to tell you.

862
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,745
I didn't want you to misunderstand
this time too.

863
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,475
Take it.

864
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:27,855
Hey, I was so disappointed
because I had no idea.

865
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,595
Thanks for telling me now.

866
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:36,865
- Thank you.
- What?

867
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:41,065
I could tell that you were mad,
but you tried to hold it back.

868
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:46,275
Let's celebrate it again next month.

869
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,605
Okay. I love you, Woo-jae.

870
