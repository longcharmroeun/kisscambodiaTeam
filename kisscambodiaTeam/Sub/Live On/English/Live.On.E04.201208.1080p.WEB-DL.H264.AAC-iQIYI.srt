It's not your fault.

by yourself?

It's exhausting.

479
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,775

Keep doing that
and if you're disappointed,

00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,915
[ Here's the truth about Baek Ho-rang. ]

1052
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,225
[ Here it is. ]

1053
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:30,655
Is this true?

1054
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,359
- No way.
- I don't believe it.

1055
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,825
- Seriously? No way!
- Gosh.

1056
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:38,565
- Look at that.
- My gosh. Seriously?

1057
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,235
What?

1058
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:42,465
Stop them.

1059
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:44,735
Young-jae, kill the lights.

1060
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:50,375
Kill the lights!

1061
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:40,965
Ho-rang.

1062
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,535
Will you hold my hand?

1063
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:38,975
[ We thank Song Sun-mi, Kenta, and Lena
for their special appearances. ]

1064
01:01:52,351 --> 01:01:55,033
[ Live On ]

1065
01:01:55,779 --> 01:01:57,418
[ Did you try calling Ho-rang? ]

1066
01:01:57,419 --> 01:01:59,048
[ I did, but she won't answer it. ]

1067
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:00,618
[ What if she drops out of school? ]

1068
01:02:00,619 --> 01:02:01,648
[ You look pretty, Ho-rang. ]

1069
01:02:01,649 --> 01:02:03,018
[ You're scared right now. ]

1070
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:05,288
You pretended to be some big shot student.

1071
01:02:05,289 --> 01:02:07,558
You're scared they'll find out
you were beaten up like a loser.

1072
01:02:07,559 --> 01:02:09,498
[ What are you hiding? ]

1073
01:02:09,499 --> 01:02:12,294
[ Tell me what happened that day. ]

1074
01:02:13,099 --> 01:02:15,994
[ Is that why you won't say anything? ]

1075
01:02:16,369 --> 01:02:17,634
Eun-taek.

1076
01:02:18,139 --> 01:02:19,604
Do you trust me?
