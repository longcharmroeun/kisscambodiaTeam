00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,675
I really looked everywhere,
but I couldn't find her.

180
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,775
My gosh.

181
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,575
I miss Ho-rang.

182
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,115
Me too.

183
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,815
It seems like you and Ho-rang got
really close while we were broken up.

184
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,285
Well...

185
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,085
She's a better person
than I thought she was.

186
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,559
But the more I think about it,
the more annoyed I'm getting.

187
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,699
If it's true, admit it,
and if it's not, she should deny it.

188
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,525
Why won't she say anything
and make everyone nervous?

189
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:38,895
My gosh.

190
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,915
We agreed to post up the ads for
the video festival today, right?

191
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,419
What?

192
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,585
- Oh, right. Yes.
- If you're busy, do you want help?

193
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,415
No, it's okay.

194
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,295
She wasn't in her classroom.

195
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,295
Baek Ho-rang.

196
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,195
I went to the nurse's office just in case,

197
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,265
but she wasn't there.

198
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,105
Oh, okay.

199
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,335
Aren't you curious?

200
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,175
About what?

201
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,579
You're not looking for her,

202
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,245
and you're just sitting here.

203
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,115
I'm waiting for her.

204
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,285
We made a promise.

205
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,395
But I'm not sure.

206
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,395
I hope it doesn't take her a long time.

207
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,105
Are you nervous?

208
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,205
Don't be nervous.

209
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,575
She'll tell you herself.

210
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,125
[ Isn't this hilarious? ]

211
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,455
[ You're the one who got beaten up, but
you're the one who's scared right now. ]

212
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:24,470
[ Baek Ho, Kim Yu, Kang Jae ]

213
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,435
[ Ho-rang. Was our school always this big? ]

214
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,199
[ Just tell me where you are,
and I'll go to you by myself. ]

215
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,270
[ Me too. ]

216
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:31,350
[ Baek Ho, Kim Yu, Kang Jae ]

217
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,879
[ If we say we're going together,
do you think she'll tell us? ]

218
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,905
[ Why not? I'm Baek Ho-rang's best friend. ]

219
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,345
[ I'm curious. ]

220
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,285
I wonder how your friends will react
after seeing that.

221
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,179
So-hyun will promote the page tomorrow.

222
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,845
Today, we're going to put up the posters
on each floor's bulletin board.

223
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,179
We can split into groups of two
and each take a floor.

224
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,345
- Okay.
- Okay.

225
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,445
Are there any questions?

226
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,485
Then what happened with Ho-rang?

227
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,429
I'm asking because she and I
are in the same group.

228
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,425
I thought we finished that discussion
this morning.

229
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,965
Oh, right.

230
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,339
We can re-edit the video,

231
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,805
but there are other things like preparing
the stage and such, which is why I asked.

232
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:36,335
I was wondering if there were
any changes since then.

233
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,409
If Baek Ho-rang comes,
I'll give her a different task,

234
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,379
so let's have someone cover for her
until then.

235
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,115
Team A's almost done filming, right?

236
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,889
Yes. We're going to finish up today.

237
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,549
Should we join Team B tomorrow?

238
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,955
Yes. Thank you.

239
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,515
Eun-taek.

240
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,530
Ho-rang left the group chat.

241
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,100
[ Baek Ho-rang left the group. ]

242
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,195
- What?
- Really?

243
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,230
- She really left the group.
- She did.

244
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,140
[ Baek Ho-rang ]

245
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,035
[ Ko Eun-taek,
I'm quitting the broadcasting team. ]

246
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,679
- Eun-taek.
- Let's talk later.

247
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,815
She won't tell you anything
even if you go see her.

248
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,789
- What?
- When I told you I'd tell you about her,

249
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,955
you said that you wanted to
hear it from her directly.

250
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:26,125
She won't tell you anything
even if you go now.

251
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,895
The post on the community

252
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,225
was written by me, Eun-taek.

253
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,375
- She's the worst.
- What?

254
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,345
Hey. Why did you ignore my messages?
I was worried about you.

255
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,649
Is it that hard to message me back?

256
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,945
You have no affection for people.

257
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,655
Where are you going? Wait a second.

258
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,695
Here.

259
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,599
It's obvious.

260
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,535
You didn't have lunch again, right?

261
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,265
Eat this first and let's talk.

262
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,079
I turned off my phone.

263
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,379
Okay.

264
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,779
I understand, so take this...

265
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,015
Because annoying people kept messaging me.

266
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,255
I need to go. Can you let go of me?

267
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,595
Hey, Baek Ho-rang.

268
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,165
What did you just do right now?

269
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,185
I get it.

270
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,385
Tell me before you leave.

271
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,289
About what?

272
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,355
You know that I'm always straightforward.

273
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,725
What was that post about?

274
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,765
You know you've been acting strange
since that message was posted, right?

275
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:20,165
You said it wasn't true.
You told me that it wasn't true.

276
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,879
Hey. Say something.

277
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,045
You're really frustrating me.

278
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,075
Why must I explain myself to you?

279
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,445
What?

280
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,485
Everything in that post

281
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,725
is true.

282
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,659
- Hey.
- That's unbelievable.

283
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,895
- I can't believe it.
- She admitted to it.

284
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,695
Your expression is a sight for sore eyes.

285
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,499
Hey, you...

286
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,635
If you can't believe me, just talk
about me behind my back like them.

287
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,909
Don't act like we're close and pretend
like you're the one who was hurt.

288
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,105
It's annoying.

289
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,605
Hey, Baek Ho-rang.

290
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,815
Hey, Kang Jae-yi.

291
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:06,884
We only started talking a few months ago.

292
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,315
Do you really think we're close?

293
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,985
You must've forgotten,

294
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:14,425
but I've always been like this.

295
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:18,825
Stop overreacting and making lame excuses
like we're friends and shut your mouth.

296
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,605
Baek Ho-rang.

297
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,315
Get out of my way.

298
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,695
What are you talking about?

299
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,095
Do you know why

300
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,565
Baek Ho-rang joined the broadcasting team?

301
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,095
She joined to find out about

302
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,735
the broadcasting team's account.

303
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:05,949
The letter from today's lunch broadcast.
Who wrote that letter?

304
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,419
[ I wrote that story. ]

305
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,249
So, come to me and say it to my face

306
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,489
instead of saying all that nonsense
from behind the keyboard.

307
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,889

from the memories of that time, ]

308
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,389
[ but I hated the fact that ]

309
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,160

living her life like nothing happened. ]

without realizing it. ]

00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,425
[ I wanted her to hear it. ]

315
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,999
[ She's afraid that it will interfere
with her popularity, ]

316
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,835
[ so she joined the broadcasting team
to keep an eye on me. ]

317
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,035
Every day was a nightmare for me.

318
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,515
Ko Eun-taek.

319
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,375
This is

320
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,715
the answer that you wanted to hear
so badly.

321
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,515
I am

322
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,785
the victim of the Baek Ho-rang incident.

323
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,609
How rude. I asked her
because I was worried about her,

324
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,679
but she made such a big deal out of it.

325
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,709
She forgot about every time
I took her side, didn't she?

326
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,945
You forgot, didn't you?

327
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,675
I have to admit,

328
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,385
I did suspect her a little.

329
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,915
But that doesn't mean that she can talk
so harshly to her friend.

330
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,585
She should've just made it clear.

331
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,355
Jae-yi, when is the discipline committee
taking action on her?

332
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,569
- What disciplinary committee?
- Ho-rang!

333
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,925
Isn't there an anti-bullying committee
at your school?

334
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,299
It was back in middle school.
Why would they do anything now?

335
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,139
And we don't even know
if it's true or not yet.

336
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,479
There are proof and a victim.
Of course it's true.

337
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,735
Hold on.

338
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,875
There's a victim?

339
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,749
You go to the same school
and you didn't even know?

00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,979
[ Don't you feel bad for... ]

352
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,979
[ We all knew that she was
a terrible person all along. ]

353
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,815
[ Ms. Ho-rang! It's okay, you're pretty. ]

354
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,989
[ I can say it was a good day ]

355
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,789
[ - after looking at your face.
- Please message me. ]

356
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,555
[ I'm proud of Korea for having Ho-rang. ]

357
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,365
[ SHBS Captain Ko Eun-taek ]

358
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,349
[ I'm in front of your house right now. ]

359
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:00,645
[ I'll wait for you for ten minutes
and leave after. ]

360
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,235
[ I'll wait for you for ten minutes
and leave after. ]

361
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,895
How long have you been waiting here?

362
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,025
I had a lot to think about.

363
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,765
It's fine. At least you're here now.

364
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:30,205
I have so many questions to ask you,

365
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,175
but let me ask you this.

366
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,175
Are you ready now?

367
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,615
To tell me what you were going to tell me.

368
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,685
Are you ready?

369
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,065
I didn't feel good about texting you
that I was quitting the broadcasting team,

370
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,435
so I wanted to tell you in person.

371
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,035
Anything else?

372
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,715
No.

373
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,089
I know you didn't say it,

374
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,655
but you were tired of it.

375
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,725
When the incident broke out
and everyone was going all over,

376
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,795
things at the broadcasting team
must've gone chaotic too,

377
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,865
and

378
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,669
I didn't want to be...

379
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,765
Baek Ho-rang!

380
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,935
Is that all you can say

381
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,445
to someone who has been waiting for you?

382
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,045
I spent the whole weekend
waiting for you to text me,

383
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,485
worried to death that something
may have happened to you.

384
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,885
So, that's all you want to say?

385
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:55,095
Everyone is busy talking about you,

386
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,625
yet you won't say anything.

387
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,025
How can I trust you then?

388
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,895
If, by chance,

389
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,265
any of that is true,

390
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:10,275
I even thought

391
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,505
of letting you two meet

392
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,505
so that you can apologize properly.

393
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,215
While you were avoiding me
and ignoring my texts and calls,

394
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,085
my head was exploding with thoughts.

395
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,115
But I held on

396
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,125
because you said you'd tell me one day.

397
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,865
Were you scared

398
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,965
that the rumors might be true?

399
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,405
Yes.

400
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,615
You must've been.

401
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,685
Maybe I believed you too easily
because you said

402
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,685
that you'd wait for me until I tell you.

403
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,365
You don't have to wait any longer.

404
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,305
Don't wait.

405
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:17,435
I don't think I can say anything to you
anyway.

406
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,945
Just think whatever you want.

407
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,185
That'll be easier for both of us.

408
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,625
Do you mean what you're saying?

409
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,655
Yes.

410
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,965
It's so much better now
that it's all out in the open.

411
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,335
We should've done this earlier.

412
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,035
That would've saved us
from unnecessary overthinking.

413
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,235
That's what I came out to tell you.

414
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,249
I'm going to quit the broadcasting team,

415
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,475
so recruit a new member or whatever.

416
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,785
And since we're talking,

417
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,355
isn't it better to be the perpetrator

418
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,055
than to be a victim?

419
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,295
Remember how I told you

420
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,805
that I like you?

421
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,975
I'm regretting telling you
that I like you for the first time.

422
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,015
Fine.

423
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,715
You can live on like that.

424
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,915
You can keep living on,
pushing people away

425
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,755
even when they wait for you.

426
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,965
You want to quit the broadcasting team?

427
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:51,865
Go ahead.

428
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,135
If that's what you want, then so be it.

429
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,515
[ "Just Me and You" ]

430
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,155
[ What's this? ]

431
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,689
They gave me these on my way out.

432
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:01,789
You like things like these.

433
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,885
You can have them.

434
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,355
[ I'll wait ]

435
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,495
until you're ready to tell me.

436
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:09,825
[ Don't wait. ]

437
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:13,495
I don't think I can say
anything to you anyway.

438
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,325
Hui-su.

439
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:46,165
Is that really you?

440
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,995
What?

441
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,039
You were mentioned
on Seoyeon High Confessions.

442
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,505
I was wondering if it was really you.

443
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,405
Why are you looking at me?

444
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,699
Just tell the truth
and make things easier for you.

445
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,895
Say that it wasn't.

446
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,605
If she really was the victim, how could
she sit there like nothing happened?

447
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,835
I don't think I could.

448
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,475
Well, the truth is...

449
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,875
Everyone is here, right?

450
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,795
I called for this meeting
to make an announcement.

451
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,025
I wanted to have a meeting this morning

452
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,535
because Baek Ho-rang dropped out.

453
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,605
So I want to divide our roles again.

454
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,309
For the last month,

455
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:50,115
I want Young-jae and So-hyun
to take care of the announcer position.

456
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:53,985
As for Team B, like we discussed,
I want Eun-ha to help out with the props.

457
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,415
Okay.

458
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,385
I know that you are confused
about what happened recently.

459
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,155
But I hope

460
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,425
you'll do your best for the last month.

461
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,299
- Okay.
- Okay.

462
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,425
Good work.

463
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,895
- Good work.
- Good work.

464
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,345
Are you okay, Eun-taek?

465
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,485
After telling you everything yesterday,

466
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,585
I thought about what I did.

467
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,685
And I was worried that
it might have come as a big shock to you.

468
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,595
I was going to find out anyway.

469
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,055
Thank you

470
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,465
for believing everything that I said.

471
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,065
I didn't believe everything you said.

472
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,265
You know the stories you sent?

473
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,705
Are you sure you wrote them
in the heat of the moment?

474
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,005
What?

475
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:57,345
Oh, those. I couldn't make it obvious
that I wrote them.

476
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,745
The stories had to be chosen
for the broadcast.

477
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,615
And I just wanted her to hear them.

478
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,285
I see. Okay.

479
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,625
Then, I'll get going.

480
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,705
I told your teacher that
you'll have a work-study day at home.

481
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,705
Okay. I see.

482
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,449
- Did you stay up all night?
- Yes.

483
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:35,345
The client wanted me to change
the proposal out of the blue.

484
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,015
Where's Dad?

485
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,629
He'll be on a business trip
until tomorrow.

486
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,055
Didn't I tell you?

487
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,355
This wouldn't be the first time.

488
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,295
Should I drop out of school?

489
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:54,835
Why?

490
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,775
No, I mean...

491
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,945
Is it because of
the school violence thing?

492
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,085
How did you know?

493
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:10,489
All of the employees at my company
are quite young.

494
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,085
They showed it to me.

495
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,355
Is it true?

496
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,895
No.

497
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,895
That's all I need.

498
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:27,069
If you avoid it and hide
because you're scared,

499
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,105
you'll basically be admitting it.

500
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,835
Why don't you hang in there a bit more?

501
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:43,215
Ho-rang, I need to get some sleep.

502
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,565
[ Did you see Ho-rang yesterday? ]

503
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:02,135
Your face says it all.
Did you have a fight with her?

504
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,545
But why do you look like
you are more hurt?

505
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,019
I doubt that you would have kept quiet
given your character.

506
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,445
I'm sure you pointed out
all the right things.

507
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,785
But why do you seem more hurt?

508
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:22,695
Hey.

509
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:25,255
You know, I broke up with Jae-yi recently.

510
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,529
When I was fighting with Jae-yi,
I thought I was rational.

511
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:31,435
And I thought I based
my arguments on logic.

512
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,405
But I didn't.

513
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,275
Nothing is black and white
in a relationship.

514
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,075
You know, just saying.

515
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:45,845
You remind me of myself not long ago.

516
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,255
You should follow your heart too.

517
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,585
I don't know what got you to agonize
yourself like this, but the thing is,

518
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,655
the most painful part was
not being able to see her.

519
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,795
I learned that lesson
the hard way this time.

520
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,205
- Let's eat some chips.
- Chips.

521
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:12,079
What were you talking about?
He looks awful.

522
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,974
Right.
His face got so slim just overnight.

523
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:19,389
Eun-taek, did Ho-rang reach out to you?

524
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,949
She didn't come to school today.

525
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:23,215
- Jae-yi. Here.
- Yes?

526
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:26,284
- Thank you.
- Sure.

[ I thought about some other things
that you liked. ]

700
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:51,995
[ You like to get fresh air from the roof. ]

701
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:56,009
[ When someone compliments you,
you act like you don't care, ]

702
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:57,775
[ but secretly, you feel really happy. ]

703
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:02,405
[ Even though you didn't tell me,
I already knew. ]

704
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:07,385
[ Your face shows it when you like
or dislike something. ]

705
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,955
[ That's why when I wasn't sure,
I always checked your expression first. ]

706
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,355
[ But why couldn't I do that this time? ]

707
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,395
[ You always told me everything ]

708
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:24,365
[ with your behavior and your expressions. ]

709
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:30,775
[ It might've been because I heard
what I wanted to hear. ]

710
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:37,375
[ You told me that ]

711
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,889
[ the more you love someone, ]

712
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:43,585
[ the more you want to hide. ]

713
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,855
[ I think I understand that
a bit more now. ]

714
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:55,695
[ That's why I'm regretting it. ]

715
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:00,265
[ I regret not understanding you properly
and losing you. ]

716
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:05,035
[ I'm sorry. ]

717
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,415
[ I'm really sorry. ]

718
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:29,149
Why is it always cold
right around the CSAT?

719
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:31,690
- My brother will probably repeat a year.
- I think the same goes for us.

720
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,049
[ Let's ace that exam! ]

721
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:33,220
[ Let's ace that exam! ]

722
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:35,259
Did you hear? Baek Ho-rang is
quitting school.

723
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,189
- Really?
- Yes.

724
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:37,959
- Who told you?
- I don't know.

725
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,929
- No way.
- I'm serious.

726
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:41,459
Whose seat is that empty one?

727
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,025
- Ho-rang's.
- Ho-rang's.

728
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:45,329
Let's start class.

729
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:47,499
Remember the assignment I gave you
last week?

730
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,735
- No.
- Come on.

731
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,035
[ Baek Ho-rang ]

732
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,809
Hey.

733
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:57,775
Hey.

734
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,375
Yu-shin, what's for lunch today?

735
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:01,819
Barley rice, seaweed soup,

736
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:03,649
duck meat, fried kimchi, and yogurt.

737
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,249
That's the worst.

738
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:06,559
Do you want to go to the snack bar?

739
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,959
You're not eating with Woo-jae today?

740
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,289
He ate first because he has
a student council meeting today.

741
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:13,425
Is that right? All right, then.
I'll have a bulgogi burger.

742
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,295
- Hey!
- So-hyun!

743
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,929
You don't have a broadcast schedule today?

744
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:20,099
No. Someone else is on it today.

745
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,869
We're heading to the snack bar.
You want to join?

746
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:24,635
Sorry, I have to be somewhere.

747
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:26,465
It's important.

748
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:28,005
What is it?

749
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:31,179
Why does she look so happy?

750
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,745
I don't know. She's so adorable.

751
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:38,215
It's this. When I uploaded
the karaoke photo on Confessions.

752
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:39,955
You showed us already
a couple of days ago.

753
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:41,355
Did I?

754
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,215
Right.

755
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:47,099
Now that I think about it,
there's something else.

756
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,795
- What is it?
- Hey, Hui-su.

757
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,279
Why are you here?
You should be eating lunch.

758
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,705
Don't mind me. Just keep doing
what you were doing.

759
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:05,279
- Hui-su!
- Yes?

760
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,815
Tell us. What is it?

761
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:08,375
Well,

762
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:12,085
it's...

763
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:20,795
Before we begin, I have an announcement
to make.

764
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,865
We're going

765
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:26,129
live for today's show.

766
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:27,765
- Live?
- Live?

767
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:29,699
Who's hosting?

768
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,535
Shouldn't Young-jae do it?

769
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:33,609
Eun-taek, then I'll...

770
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:34,675
No worries.

771
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,305
The host is

772
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,645
coming soon.

773
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,255
No way!

774
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,855
Ko Eun-taek,

775
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,295
the truth is,

776
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:45,005
I'm not the perpetrator. I'm a victim.

777
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:55,275
What I couldn't tell you is...

778
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:30,385
Don't tell me.

779
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,345
You don't have to.

780
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,655
It's fine.

781
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,025
It's all going to be fine.

782
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:26,565
That's why

783
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:33,105
I thought I'd be able to say the truth.

784
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:37,285
You can say whatever you want.

785
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,915
I'll take care of everything else.

786
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,269
- I'm serious.
- Please turn on the TV!

787
00:54:58,270 --> 00:54:59,739
Our show is starting soon!

788
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:00,779
- What?
- What?

789
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:02,279
- What?
- They're broadcasting on TV today?

790
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,079
Please turn the TV on.

791
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,909
Young-jae, we're holding
a live show today?

792
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:07,479
I wasn't told that.

793
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,849
Earlier at the Broadcasting Studio...

794
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:11,145
Young-jae, you can get going now.
I'll explain it to her.

795
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:12,345
Okay.

796
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:15,415
Are you going to stay here?

797
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:18,729
Isn't that Baek Ho-rang?

798
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:21,655
- What?
- No way.

799
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:25,665
Hello.

800
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:28,095
I'm Baek Ho-rang.

801
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,669
It's her.

802
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:33,705
[ I wanted to say something to everyone, ]

803
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:37,575
[ and that's why I'm on camera today. ]

804
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:41,645
[ I think this will be ]

805
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,415
the first and the last time I'll say this.

806
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,655
I'm...

807
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:01,695
To tell you the truth,

808
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:08,735
I'm a victim of school bullying.

809
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,449
- What is she saying?
- What does she mean?

810
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:12,979
- She's not the perpetrator?
- What?

811
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:15,449
[ It took me two whole years ]

812
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:16,679
[ to bring myself to say this. ]

813
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,389
What is she talking about?

814
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:20,615
[ It was my birthday. ]

815
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,489
[ My so-called friends called me ]

816
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:25,885
[ to come to the karaoke
for my birthday party, ]

817
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:28,525
[ and there, ]

818
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:31,195
[ I was bullied. ]

819
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,965
[ But even then, ]

820
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:40,035
[ I couldn't tell anyone, ]

821
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,949
[ not even to the one person ]

822
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:45,975
[ who genuinely thought of me
as her friend. ]

823
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,975
[ Even more than the fact
that I was beaten up ]

824
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:52,715
[ and it was physically hurting, ]

825
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,399
[ I was more scared
of how everyone would think of me. ]

826
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,095
- Is she serious?
- No way.

827
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:09,535
[ "She was probably bullied
because there was a good reason." ]

828
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,805
I was scared of

829
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:16,605
people's thoughtless comments
and pitiful eyes at me.

830
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:21,015
[ Here's what I could do
when I was being bullied. ]

831
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:23,545
I closed my eyes

832
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:27,815
and kept quiet.

833
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:31,155
And I thought, "It will go away someday."

834
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:35,155
I tried to get through it
with that in mind.

835
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:42,065
But in the end, I became the bully.

836
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:45,835
[ Whether I was the bully or the victim, ]

837
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:48,609
[ I still had to deal with being stared at
by so many people. ]

838
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:50,205
[ So I don't care anymore. ]

839
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:52,549
[ I thought being the bully ]

840
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:54,815
[ might be less embarrassing
than being the victim. ]

841
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:57,415
What is this all about?

842
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,785
- Ho-rang.
[ - But it wasn't. ]

843
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:05,285
[ What my friends wanted ]

844
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,995
was the truth.

845
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,765
[ My friends ]

846
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:14,735
[ wanted to know the truth ]

847
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,505
[ even if they didn't want to face it ]

848
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:22,335
or believe it.

849
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:28,845
So

850
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:33,915
I decided to speak out instead of hiding.

851
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:40,055
Not just for me,

852
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:44,425
but for my friends too.

853
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:05,745
Hey, Jeong Hui-su.

854
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:08,855
Stop the act now.

855
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:11,425
What are you talking about?

856
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:13,255
I was scared of her.

857
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:15,325
I'm sure you know too, So-hyun.

858
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:18,165
You know how much Baek Ho-rang hurt me.

859
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:20,399
Ever since she joined
the broadcasting team, I...

860
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,595
Ho-rang lost
the flash drive at the festival

861
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:24,265
because of you.

862
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:26,669
- Really?
- She did that?

863
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:28,705
- What?
- Was she lying all along?

864
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,109
- To say that you were scared,
- What's this about?

865
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:33,079
- you obviously weren't.
- What is that?

866
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,975
- What is that?
- She's right.

867
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,815
- Let me see.
- Hey, bring it.

868
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,315
I hated her.

869
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:44,025
Why? I can't do that?

870
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:46,985
Well, sure. Let's leave it at that.

871
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:49,729
The evidence photo you showed
to your friends earlier.

872
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:51,325
Can you show that to me too?

873
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:53,065
Let me verify that.

874
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:56,895
Who knows?

875
00:59:58,310 --> 01:00:00,805
Perhaps, I might find similar photos
somewhere when I start digging.

876
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:03,905
Let me see it.

877
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:09,949
- Seriously?
- She really lied?

878
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:11,649
- Unbelievable.
- I can't believe it.

879
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:14,059
- Is this really happening?
- She faked it?

880
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:15,485
- No way.
- Gosh.

881
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:19,825
Fine. Yes!

882
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:22,325
It was all an act.

883
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:25,129
I did all of that because
I wanted her to be miserable.

884
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:26,799
- What?
- Seriously?

885
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,699
- Can you believe this?
- She's crazy.

886
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,395
What about you guys?

887
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:33,569
Let's be honest. You were badmouthing her

888
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:35,235
because this was the perfect chance.

889
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:38,445
Why are you looking at me like that?

890
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:41,275
Why are you treating me like a psychopath?

891
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:44,289
You didn't like her from the start too!

892
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:46,389
Why are you pretending
you had no part in this?

893
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:47,555
Darn it.

894
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:51,489
You crazy witch!

895
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:54,129
- Hey, say that again. What?
- Hey, what are you doing?

896
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:55,529
You come here!

897
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:57,269
- Stop it.
- You!

898
01:00:57,270 --> 01:01:00,735
I am afraid of how people
will look at me now.

899
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,795
But from now on,

900
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:07,575
I will not run away because I'm scared.

901
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,445
And because people who love me

902
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:21,255
are with me now.

903
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:36,195
Good job, Ho-rang.

904
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:40,865
I have nothing hiding from you now.

905
01:02:42,193 --> 01:02:43,288
I know.

906
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:47,735
Thank you for giving me time, Eun-taek.

907
01:04:20,258 --> 01:04:23,512
[ Live On ]

908
01:04:23,968 --> 01:04:25,133
[ Eun-taek. ]

909
01:04:26,108 --> 01:04:27,603
[ Do you want to meet tomorrow? ]

910
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:29,107
[ - So-hyun. ]
- Yes?

911
01:04:29,108 --> 01:04:30,547
It's been so long, right?

912
01:04:30,548 --> 01:04:33,473
Do you remember when we dated?

913
01:04:34,148 --> 01:04:36,143
[ It's Woo-jae and my 1,000th day
anniversary soon. ]

914
01:04:36,278 --> 01:04:37,817
[ We'll get a present for each other ]

915
01:04:37,818 --> 01:04:40,047
[ and exchange it on that day
as a surprise. So it's a secret. ]

916
01:04:40,048 --> 01:04:42,083
[ I'm sorry for making you wait long. ]

917
01:04:42,588 --> 01:04:44,583
I like you, Eun-taek.

918
01:04:46,358 --> 01:04:47,823
[ The waiting was worth it. ]

919
01:04:48,658 --> 01:04:49,753
Ho-rang.
