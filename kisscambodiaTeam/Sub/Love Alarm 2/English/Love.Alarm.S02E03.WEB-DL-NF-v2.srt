00:00:00,325 --> 00:00:03,889
Ripped by TTEOKBOKKIsubs

2
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:46,796
<i>There's no way</i>

3
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,501
<i>knew this about me,</i>

4
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,130
<i>could I still</i>

5
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,300
<i>keep liking you?</i>

6
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,263
Does Hye-yeong know?

7
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:58,808
Does Hye-yeong know

8
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:01,603
about the shield?

9
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:06,483
You didn't tell him.

10
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,277
Why not?

11
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,905
In case he finds out that you like me?

12
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,867
If not, deny it.

13
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:18,953
Tell me

14
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,914
so I can understand.

15
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,461
Yes.

16
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,757
I installed the shield because of you.

17
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,677
But I'm here because of Hye-yeong.

18
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,974
You made me install the shield,

19
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,646
but he makes me want to remove it.

20
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,607
Liar.

21
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,611
Look at me.

22
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,696
Look me in the eye and say that again.

23
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,253
It has nothing to do with you anymore.

24
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:14,717
No.

25
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:20,849
You like me.

26
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,692
You still like me.

27
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:32,986
Jojo!

28
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,738
You still like me!

29
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:11,983
What's a shield?

30
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,195
It rings if you like them.

31
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,865
Isn't that what Love Alarm is?

32
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,659
So what's a shield?

33
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,746
Did you scam people with their feelings?

34
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,001
That's between Chon Duk-gu and Kim Jojo.

35
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:31,753
Chon Duk-gu.

36
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,672
Who the hell is Chon Duk-gu?

37
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,008
Is he the developer?

38
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:39,969
Then what about you?

39
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,472
Who are you?

40
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,311
Why must I explain
every little detail to you?

41
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,270
Explain.

42
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,731
You have to explain!

43
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,526
Do you know what happened to me
because of that shield?

44
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,409
Four years of my life

45
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:06,913
were destroyed like this.

46
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,463
It's a shame,
but I can just get a new one.

47
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,632
Really?

48
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,344
If it isn't a big deal,
should I go downstairs…

49
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,641
and tell the reporters about the shield?

50
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:28,935
Go ahead.

51
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,988
Would your father be okay with it?

52
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,990
You'll be the talk of the town.

53
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,158
What about Kim Jojo?

54
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,580
The girl with a shield.

55
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,166
What a perfect headline.

56
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,463
Don't you dare

57
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,799
say Jojo's name.

58
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:42,175
<i>The number you have dialed
is currently out of reach…</i>

59
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,692
You finally saw me.

60
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,284
My battery died. That's why
your Love Alarm didn't ring.

61
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,249
Let's go. I'll take you home.

62
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:20,588
Okay.

63
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,847
I'm glad we didn't miss each other.

64
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:40,942
-Hey…
-Hey…

65
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,830
What is it? Is something wrong?

66
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,082
No.

67
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,751
I was just happy.

68
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,754
I'm so happy to see you.

69
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:11,639
Were you busy today? You look tired.

70
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,142
Do I?

71
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,687
I rested at home all day, but…

72
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,774
Were you home?

73
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,151
What?

74
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,320
Yes.

75
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,575
I see.

76
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:36,956
I'm glad I got to see you

77
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,292
even if it was for a few minutes.

78
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,642
MISSED CALL
JOJO

79
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,771
<i>I left strawberries at your door. Enjoy.</i>

80
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,036
<i>Even Hye-yeong's little lie
that he was home</i>

81
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,455
<i>makes me this nervous.</i>

82
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,752
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

83
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,880
<i>Does Hye-yeong know about the shield?</i>

84
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,300
<i>You didn't tell him.</i>

85
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:30,968
<i>No.</i>

86
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,054
You like me.

87
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,394
<i>I thought it would be fine
as long as I could hide my feelings.</i>

88
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,980
<i>But now this shield</i>

89
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:47,318
<i>is weighing down on Hye-yeong
and Sun-oh as well.</i>

90
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,784
YUK-JO

91
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,137
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

92
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:53,884
You can't tell now, but you'll see
it's huge once we empty it out.

93
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,471
It may not look great,
but there's no mold anywhere.

94
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,182
-Rent it out as quickly as possible.
-Okay.

95
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,893
Mom. What are you doing?

96
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,312
You said it was vacant.

97
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,896
It is. She doesn't pay rent.

98
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,815
-I'm clearing this out.
-Mom.

99
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:11,485
Mom. He came in yesterday.
He really is the founding developer.

100
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,280
-He'll be back if you wait a little.
-Forget it.

101
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,573
It's for real this time.

102
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,325
You and your promises.

103
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,826
As if I'd believe that.

104
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,162
Mom. It's for real.

105
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,124
I'm not moving out.
There's way too much mold here

106
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,001
and it is humid--

107
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,002
Hey! Get over here.

108
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,253
No. She's moving out.

109
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,546
<i>I'm willing to negotiate the rent,</i>

110
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,881
<i>-so find someone.
-I won't do it.</i>

111
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:32,798
<i>-I'm not.
-Rent it out</i>

112
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:33,966
<i>-as quickly as you can.
-Okay.</i>

113
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:34,884
<i>Good.</i>

114
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,428
Hey.

115
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,429
How did it go?

116
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,807
What? Did it not go well?

117
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:43,768
Well…

118
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,394
He says he isn't Duk-gu.

119
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,730
No way. That can't be.

120
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,731
I can run it again--

121
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,690
It's okay.

122
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,110
It's not okay.
You have to find Duk-gu, so that you--

123
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,155
I feel like I'm making things worse
by trying to fix it.

124
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,869
Have something sweet. It'll cheer you up.

125
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,330
Mon-sun.

126
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,167
Are you frustrated
that I don't tell you everything?

127
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,085
Yes.

128
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,047
But I'm fine for now.

129
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,720
I'll probably be hurt
if you take too long.

130
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,728
<i>Early morning today,
a teenage girl was found dead</i>

131
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,231
<i>on the Seongjaecheon hiking trail
in Seoul.</i>

132
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,441
<i>The police requested an autopsy
from the NFS,</i>

133
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,528
<i>obtained security videos from the area
and said they'd investigate</i>

134
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,446
-<i>thoroughly.</i>
-It's the end of the world.

135
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,204
Review it and submit it to Finance.

136
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,081
Yes, sir.

137
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,377
Finish before the team dinner tonight.

138
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,045
Actually,

139
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,798
I have to see my mother tonight.

140
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,600
Turn on your Love Alarm.

141
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,612
How can this be?

142
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,033
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

143
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,178
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

144
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,203
You said you don't like flowers
because they wilt.

145
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,790
They haven't wilted yet.

146
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,670
Do you even consider Yuk-jo's feelings?

147
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,716
She came all the way here yesterday.

148
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,849
When I left this house,
saying I won't live

149
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,851
like Grandma…

150
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,229
Back then,

151
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,857
I felt like I could do anything.

152
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:43,322
I was the most confident person
in the entire world back then.

153
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,325
Everyone's like that at that age.

154
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:51,622
You think everything will go well for you,

155
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,042
and…

156
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,926
nothing bad will happen.

157
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,906
It was hard, wasn't it?

158
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,465
I'm sorry.

159
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,475
I'm sorry, Hye-yeong. I'm sorry.

160
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,734
Still…

161
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,279
Still, you grew up well, so…

162
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:12,828
<i>But did I really</i>

163
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,789
<i>grow up well?</i>

164
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,353
Are you leaving without saying hi?

165
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,624
Does it look different from up there?

166
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,088
It's dangerous.

167
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,595
I met Jojo yesterday.

168
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,684
Aren't you going to ask

169
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,687
why I met her?

170
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,566
I don't care.

171
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,110
There you go again,

172
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:28,821
pretending to be fine.

173
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,157
Jojo

174
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,412
still doesn't ring your Love Alarm, right?

175
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,872
I don't care if she doesn't

176
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,418
since I'm waiting with her.

177
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:45,879
You're waiting?

178
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,344
I think I'm drunk. I should go.

179
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,068
How did we end up like this?

180
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,322
Let's be honest.

181
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,492
Lately, I've been thinking…

182
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,081
about the promise you made
when we were little.

183
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,294
When you promised to protect me…

184
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,798
if anyone gave me a hard time.

185
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,532
But who do I go to…

186
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,082
if that person is you?

187
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,551
<i>I met Jojo yesterday.</i>

188
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:17,971
<i>Aren't you going to ask</i>

189
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,807
<i>why I met her?</i>

190
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,087
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

191
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,815
<i>The number you have dialed
is currently out of reach…</i>

192
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,830
<i>The number you have dialed…</i>

193
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,591
Why do you never get angry?

194
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:20,427
No.

195
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,513
Are you angry beyond control,

196
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,392
but can't show it?

197
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,164
<i>Hye-yeong, what are you up to?</i>

198
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,083
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

199
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,050
Come in.

200
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,219
I smell like alcohol.

201
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,314
Sorry. I wanted to see you.

202
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,026
Did you drink?

203
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,987
Yes, a little.

204
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,492
Hey, Hye-yeong…

205
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,792
Sorry I lied about staying home yesterday.

206
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,255
Something happened.

207
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,134
I have to go somewhere tomorrow.

208
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,681
I think I'll be able to gather
my thoughts once I'm back.

209
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,107
Do you think you could wait until then?

210
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,291
Good night.

211
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:15,959
Bye.

212
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,724
<i>Something is going on with Hye-yeong.</i>

213
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,604
<i>And yet, the only thing I can do</i>

214
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,398
<i>is wait.</i>

215
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,613
<i>Why is it so hard for us
to do little things</i>

216
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,282
<i>like asking and answering questions?</i>

217
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,911
Just go. Didn't you hear me?

218
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:55,999
I did.

219
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:00,462
I can't leave you
all alone like this, though.

220
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,467
It's fine. I don't feel alone.

221
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,345
That's because
you've felt alone for so long

222
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,431
that you don't even realize you are.

223
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,644
And how do you know that?

224
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,856
You don't know me well enough to say so.

225
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,066
How can I not know

226
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,485
when I see it all so clearly?

227
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,082
"When I see it all so clearly."

228
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,739
Shouldn't you wear a tie?

229
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,157
What?

230
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,493
Yes.

231
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,318
I'm good at it now, right?

232
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,200
I can do it now because you taught me.

233
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:42,499
I don't know what you have to do today,

234
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,419
but will you be uncomfortable
if I'm there?

235
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,055
You could never make me uncomfortable.

236
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:02,811
But…

237
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,606
There's something I haven't told you.

238
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:10,110
You don't have to tell me.

239
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,738
Let me go with you anyway.

240
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:15,573
You're the one who said

241
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:20,036
being in a relationship means doing things
together that you can't do alone.

242
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,333
<i>I think I knew deep down inside</i>

243
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,128
<i>although my mom didn't tell me.</i>

244
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:35,820
I'll be back.

245
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,364
Okay.

246
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:38,865
I'll be waiting.

247
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:01,429
<i>I repented a lot while I was in here.</i>

248
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,057
I even got baptized.

249
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,226
You don't believe me?

250
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,354
They have a record
of my religious activities.

251
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,191
I'm really going to change now.

252
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,567
<i>He says he regrets it.</i>

253
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,569
No. I've changed already.

254
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,782
You can tell, right? You were sad
that you didn't have a dad, right?

255
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,700
I'll get on my knees and apologize.

256
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,244
<i>He says he'll be good this time.</i>

257
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:27,414
The preacher here even promised
to help me once I got out.

258
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,998
-<i>But I know.</i>
-Do you know

259
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,750
how many people attend worship here?

260
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,919
But I'm the only one…

261
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,754
<i>Because I take after him.</i>

262
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,633
<i>His looks,</i>

263
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:41,636
<i>his habits…</i>

264
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,348
<i>When I lie,</i>

265
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,685
<i>my throat feels tight.</i>

266
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,953
Why did you come here?

267
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,416
Are you here to mess with me?

268
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,921
Sign it already. Sign it.

269
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:20,759
Get me out of this hell hole.

270
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,635
Got it? You little brat.

271
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,691
<i>Will I regret what I did today?</i>

272
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:42,030
PAROLE DENIED
AT THE GUARDIAN'S REFUSAL

273
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,115
<i>Hye-yeong</i>

274
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,161
<i>used to look at himself in the mirror</i>

275
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:35,834
<i>and picture his father
who he never saw before.</i>

276
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,799
<i>That was why</i>

277
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,803
<i>he had to be a good person.</i>

278
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:49,973
<i>Because that way,</i>

279
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,684
<i>his father would be a good person too.</i>

280
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,610
<i>People act two different ways
when they are hurt.</i>

281
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:08,241
I was a total dweeb earlier, right?
Crying and all?

282
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,633
<i>People who cover up and hide the wound
and let it fester.</i>

283
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:32,140
<i>People who show their wounds
and grow like trees.</i>

284
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,445
How was the Badge Club event?

285
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,364
I wanted to see
a photo of you two together.

286
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,074
You did?

287
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:03,004
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

288
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,380
<i>Sun-oh.</i>

289
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,716
<i>I had a really good dream last night.</i>

290
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,009
<i>What was it about?</i>

291
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,514
<i>That you rang my Love Alarm.</i>

292
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,776
I shouldn't take it out on you.

293
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:26,861
I'm sorry.

294
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,810
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

295
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,249
Are you going to just stand there?

296
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,129
Yuk-jo.

297
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,009
-Yesterday, I--
-When you left me at the Badge Club…

298
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,387
I saw Jojo that day.

299
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,100
You asked why I wasn't angry, right?

300
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,562
This is me being angry.

301
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:52,530
Sun-oh.

302
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,078
We can't keep going on like this, can we?

303
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:22,643
<i>I'm with Congressman Hwang Jae-cheol
who is up for reelection.</i>

304
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:27,106
<i>So, Congressman Hwang,
it was your wife's birthday recently.</i>

305
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,858
<i>Yes, it was.</i>

306
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:32,737
<i>I heard you were preparing
something tremendous.</i>

307
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,532
<i>How did it go? Did she like it?</i>

308
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,201
<i>Of course. She was happy.</i>

309
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:41,162
<i>But I was even more moved,
and almost cried.</i>

310
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,039
<i>When I first met my wife…</i>

311
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,543
<i>They still don't have a suspect
for the Love Alarm Murder.</i>

312
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,088
<i>We met with the victim's family.</i>

313
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,339
<i>According to the family,</i>

314
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:54,467
<i>her Love Alarm rang immediately
before she went missing,</i>

315
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:58,304
<i>and they assert that the person
who rang it is the prime suspect.</i>

316
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,619
Want one?

317
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,337
Tell me if something's wrong.

318
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:33,840
Who knows?

319
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,259
I may be able to help.

320
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,680
How will you help?

321
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,433
Will you lock me up like last time?

322
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:52,900
It was the final stage
of your father's campaign back then.

323
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,487
We had no choice.

324
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,448
You know the race
was very close at the time.

325
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,327
But if you were in the news…

326
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,747
That's how he won the election.

327
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,251
But because of that, I…

328
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,137
You can never understand…

329
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,808
what I lost back then.

330
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:30,771
What did you lose?

331
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,401
CDG HAS ENTERED THE CHAT

332
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,700
Wait, wait! Don't go.

333
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,580
You're CDG, right? The founding developer.

334
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,641
<i>Is the number of hearts that important?</i>

335
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,521
<i>You're saying you want to gain them
without effort.</i>

336
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,022
Yes. No, no.

337
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,735
What do you mean, no effort?

338
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,655
I'm doing the best I can in my own way.

339
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,742
I cried and endured
all sorts of humiliation.

340
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,495
Why does everyone say
that I haven't made an effort?

341
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:13,541
Why does everyone belittle my effort?
Tell me why. Why?

342
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,044
<i>Let's do this then.</i>

343
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,756
<i>The Badge Club member
with the fewest hearts has 3,000.</i>

344
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,010
<i>Gain at least a tenth of it on your own.</i>

345
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:28,055
<i>Then I'll consider rewarding you for it.</i>

346
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,145
Reward? Like what?

347
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:39,692
What's this?

348
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:40,860
CDG HAS LEFT THE CHAT

349
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,486
What's this? Did he leave?

350
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:44,655
You can't leave.

351
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:47,700
You can't leave. What am I supposed to do?

352
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,411
LOVE ALARM GO
INSTALL THE APP SENT BY CDG?

353
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:52,955
What's this?

354
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,918
PEOPLE WHO WILL LOVE YOU
WILL BE MARKED ON THE MAP

355
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,008
Is he really the founding developer?

356
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,809
He really is. He is!

357
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:19,982
Badge Club! Here I come!

358
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,280
<i>The police requested assistance
in investigating the murder.</i>

359
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:11,158
<i>They'd like to see Love Alarm's records.</i>

360
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,284
<i>What should we do?</i>

361
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,677
<i>If not, deny it.</i>

362
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,138
<i>Tell me so I can understand.</i>

363
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:36,475
<i>I like building things up
slowly like this.</i>

364
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:14,638
Why? Are you going to do
physical labor somewhere after you eat?

365
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,515
Mom, I may not come home tonight, so--

366
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,892
Then don't come home at all.

367
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:18,851
Just move out.

368
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,523
MEMORANDUM

369
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:32,448
<i>Memorandum. One. I'll close
my online shopping mall temporarily.</i>

370
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:35,868
<i>Two. I'll work at the convenience store
for at least four whole hours.</i>

371
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:38,329
<i>Three. I'll pay back the four million won</i>

372
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:41,749
<i>by making monthly payments
of 500,000 won no matter what it takes.</i>

373
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:45,920
<i>I swear I will really perform
the above actions.</i>

374
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,880
<i>Park Gul-mi.</i>

375
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,719
It's not because you told me
to move out of the basement.

376
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,012
This time, it's for…

377
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,018
This time, it's really for real.

378
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,062
-I really mean it.
-Did I say anything?

379
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:06,982
I remembered how you couldn't write
a daily schedule on your own

380
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,235
and copied Jojo's before, that's why.

381
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,071
There's no need to bring that up.

382
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,618
I'll watch the convenience store
even when Jojo isn't there.

383
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,119
Sure.

384
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,247
Go right ahead.

385
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,421
What's wrong with you?

386
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,507
You should do everything you want too.

387
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,852
I thought you weren't eating breakfast.

388
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,981
What? Are you determined
to do something too?

389
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,691
Thank you for the food.

390
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:49,692
You little…

391
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:19,597
<i>Let's meet today.
I'll go to your office after class.</i>

392
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,564
<i>There's something
I have to tell you today.</i>

393
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,423
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

394
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,799
What's wrong with that freak?

395
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:44,825
See that? He sat behind me
even when he knew I rang his Love Alarm.

396
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:48,162
I think love is coming my way again.

397
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,130
What's wrong? Did something happen again?

398
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:00,966
The thing is--

399
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,843
Isn't that Hwang Sun-oh?

400
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,179
What? Hwang Sun-oh? Where?

401
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,513
Isn't that Hwang Sun-oh?

402
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:35,918
Where will you run to this time?

403
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:38,086
Aren't Hwang Sun-oh
and Lee Yuk-jo going out?

404
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:41,381
-Did he ring Jojo's Love Alarm?
-Isn't it the other way around?

405
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,300
Do they know each other?

406
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:17,668
Jojo.

407
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,170
Jojo!

408
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:26,760
Look at me.

409
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,099
Sun-oh.

410
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,142
The shield--

411
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,270
I feel like I'm going crazy
ever since I found out.

412
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:38,855
But you…

413
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:42,734
You won't give me an explanation
no matter how much I ask.

414
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,071
Since you didn't tell Hye-yeong either.

415
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:49,575
I'm so angry…

416
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,537
I'm so angry,
I feel like I'm going to lose my mind.

417
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,666
So I considered
going public about it, but…

418
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,669
Do you know what I've decided?

419
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,175
From now on,

420
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,305
I'll only believe your eyes.

421
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:40,667
See?

422
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:43,545
You like me.

423
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:54,806
<i>See that? See the name of the person
who will love me?</i>

424
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,100
<i>Is that why you're so happy?</i>

425
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,686
<i>Of course. It says you'll love me.</i>

426
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:04,441
