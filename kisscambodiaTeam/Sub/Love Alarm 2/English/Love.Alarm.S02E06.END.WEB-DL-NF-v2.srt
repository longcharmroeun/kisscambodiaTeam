00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,078
-Look at that. Over there.
-What's that?

3
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,120
Look at that.

4
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,747
-What's that?
-Isn't that Love Alarm?

5
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:23,666
What's that?

6
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,381
Hey, I bet it can be seen most clearly
from our school.

7
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,717
-Really?
-Make sure you take good photos.

8
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:45,313
<i>Are you the founding developer
of Love Alarm?</i>

9
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:50,026
<i>Is this Chon Duk-gu?</i>

10
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,738
<i>Duk-gu, it's Jojo.</i>

11
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,993
<i>I want to talk to you about something.</i>

12
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,505
<i>Why is it so hard</i>

13
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,590
<i>to tell someone you like them</i>

14
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,717
<i>when you like them?</i>

15
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,782
What are you so engrossed in?

16
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,826
Hey, you're here. It's nothing.

17
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,578
It's famous these days,
so I wondered what it was.

18
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,539
How was the audition? Did you do well?

19
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:51,171
You said you were going crazy
doing nothing, and asked for anything.

20
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,547
That's why I signed you up.

21
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,930
He wants me to come back tomorrow.

22
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,849
To do a screen test.

23
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:03,933
For real?

24
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,143
My gosh.

25
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,769
I'll make a reservation at the salon then.

26
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,813
Nice, Hwang Sun-oh.

27
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,921
<i>Hye-yeong!</i>

28
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,589

29

SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

30
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,379
Excuse me, this is the police.

31
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,214
We have a warrant for search and seizure.

32
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:43,551
This won't take long, so if everyone
could wait to the side, please.

33
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,011
Step out of the way, please.

34
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,512
Excuse us.

35
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,182
Take everything here.

36
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,312
In-su? What about him?
Isn't he on vacation?

37
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,856
-Grab the documents.
-He must have done something.

38
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,838
<i>Friend? Hey, you're the one
who ruined our friendship.</i>

39
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,091
You said we're friends.
Why did you have to lie?

40
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,759
Whose fault is it, then?

41
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,052
<i>It's all your fault.</i>

42
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,429
<i>You installed it as you pleased,
and hid as you pleased.</i>

43
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,722
You didn't even give me time to prepare.

44
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,265
I was willing to wait

45
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,644
while listening to you by your side.

46
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,772
<i>Building it up slowly was…</i>

47
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,817
what I wanted to do.

48
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,746
What are you doing here?

49
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,712
I did as you drew because
you seemed to be having a hard time.

50
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,632
So why hasn't anything changed?

51
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,344
You don't have anyone either.

52
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,305
You're alone too.

53
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,312
That's why you post them.

54
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,857
<i>The Ringing World.</i>

55
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,816
That's not true.

56
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,401
That's not it.

57
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:25,653
I knew it.

58
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,116
I knew it wouldn't work.

59
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,252
Tell me.

60
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,753
I can help--

61
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,400
Hey, Jang In-su!

62
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,413
Hey, Jang In-su!

63
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,957
Stop!

64
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,960
Run! Get him!

65
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,465
-Stop!
-You bastard, stop!

66
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,516
Grab him!

67
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,184
Stay still, you punk.

68
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,728
Jang In-su!
You are under arrest for murder.

69
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,314
-Let go!
-You have the right to remain silent.

70
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,942
You have the right to an attorney. Got it?

71
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,661
Tell me.

72
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,664
You're alone too.

73
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,832
You don't have anyone!

74
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,419
I did everything you drew.

75
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,005
Why hasn't anything changed?

76
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,010
Let go!

77
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,727
You should have…

78
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,355
You should have died back then.

79
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,691
Mommy.

80
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,111
You should have died back then.

81
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:32,822
No.

82
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,449
That's not what it was.

83
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,004
Let go!

84
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,225
<i>The suspect of the Love Alarm murders
has been arrested.</i>

85
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,437
<i>According to police, witnesses who saw…</i>

86
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,025
<i>Based on witness statements, the victim's
Love Alarm rang just before the incident</i>

87
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:13,112
<i>and the police were able to locate
the suspect after obtaining logs.</i>

88
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:16,240
<i>The police had been following
the artist of</i> The Ringing World

89
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,701
<i>and were able to apprehend the suspect.</i>

90
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,918
THE RINGING WORLD

91
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,962
WHO ARE THE VICTIMS OF <i>TRW</i>?
WHO IS THE ARTIST BEHIND <i>TRW</i>?

92
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,301
<i>THE RINGING WORLD</i> ARTIST UNHARMED

93
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,586
Did Jojo kill her?

94
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:43,137
No, right? So why do you keep calling
and telling her to explain?

95
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,184
Look, I get it.

96
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,020
I know you need a witness statement,

97
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,315
but she's burning up
and knocked out from the meds.

98
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,691
She can't go all the way there!

99
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,195
This is so frustrating.

100
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,868
I'll head there now.

101
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,873
<i>The attention shifted from Love Alarm

102
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:12,958

103
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,628
<i>Nothing out of the ordinary

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,801
<i>The police just called</i>

106
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,888
<i>saying they want to summon you

107
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,694
<i>The Ringing World</i>

108
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,616

00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:58,837
Thank you.

112
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,258
Will you be able to go home alone?

113
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,593
Yes.

114
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,137
Okay, then. Get home safely.

How far along are we
with In-su's projects?

117
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,775
We're working on them as quickly as
we can from where he left off.

118
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,235
What about the funding report?

119
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:06,989
Hye-yeong.

120
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,911

122
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,415
Call Finance and ask them to revise this.

123
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,667
<i>According to the police,</i>

00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,879
<i>he said he acted out

125
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,925
<i>This isn't the first time
</i>The Ringing World<i> has been an issue.</i>

126
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:31,680
<i>Correct. After the 23-person mass suicide,
people spoke about it being a prophecy.</i>

127
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:36,101
<i>She kept posting meaningful illustrations
without any explanations.</i>

128
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,271
<i>That is why this copycat crime happened.</i>

129
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,734
<i>We can't say she isn't responsible.
A person died, after all.</i>

130
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,507
It's all my fault.

131

All of it.

132
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,649
I don't know where it all went wrong.

133
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,279
Was it when I survived alone?

134
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,452
I shouldn't just do nothing.

135
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,832
What if something bad happens again?

136
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,450

00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,702
Turns out Kim Jojo is the artist.

145

146
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,634

00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,285
I'm exhausted.

155
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,413
And that has changed my feelings for you.

00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,341
<i>I need to tell you something.</i>

181
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,852
<i>I was afraid</i>

182
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,896
<i>that everyone would leave me</i>

183
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,191
<i>if they found out what I've been through.</i>

184
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:17,794
HYE-YEONG, CAN WE MEET FOR A BIT?

185
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,061
<i>Thanks for waiting.</i>

186
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,481
<i>Sorry</i>

187
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,400
<i>for only resenting you.</i>

188
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:42,694
<i>Why are you sorry?</i>

189
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,613
<i>I'm the one who's sorry</i>

190
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,074
<i>for not being honest with you.</i>

191
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,119
<i>You can't even ring my Love Alarm.</i>

192
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,663
<i>So why do you look so loving?</i>

193
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,919
<i>People might think you like me.</i>

194
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:03,423
<i>Whenever I think about you,</i>

195
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:05,967
<i>I get emotional.</i>

196
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,166
Did you ever regret

197
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:40,627
installing the shield?

198
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,882
I regretted it every second.

199
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,887
But still,

200
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,098
I think I'd install it again.

201
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,477
I learned a lot through that choice.

202
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,399
So even if I were to go back in time,

203
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:07,696
I'd install the shield again,
regret it again,

204
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,658
and be hurt again.

205
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,791
Don't cry. I won't cry either.

206
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:32,846
I'm sorry.

207
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,183
Don't be sorry.

208
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,604
Liking someone…

209
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,817
isn't something to be sorry for.

210
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:13,011
<i>Hey, don't be so clingy. It's a turnoff.</i>

211
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,597
<i>Come on, Jojo. Have you forgotten
that you're dating Hwang Sun-oh?</i>

212
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,472
Bye.

213
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,507
We'll start the screen test.

214
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:27,645
Thank you for coming today, Sun-oh.

215
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:39,741
It was Jojo's will to use the shield
and the spear.

216
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:46,122
If she hadn't installed the shield,
she never would have gone out with you.

217
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,170
It was because she installed the shield
and broke up with Sun-oh

218
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:56,716
that you were able to show up
on the list of people she would like.

219
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,053
What do you…

220
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,599
With the shield as a variable,
Jojo's volition intervened,

221
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,560
and you became someone she would like.

222
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,484
I think she wanted to ring your Love Alarm
even if it meant she had to use the spear.

223
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:19,989
She was willing to go that far
to express how she felt toward you.

224
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,033
If that isn't sincere,

225
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:23,993
what is?

226
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,354
<i>Hye-yeong.</i>

227
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,983
<i>I realize that there's something I must do</i>

228
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,652
<i>in order to be honest with you.</i>

229
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,617
<i>When I come back,</i>

230
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,329
<i>will you listen to what I have to say?</i>

231
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,247
GIMPO, JEJU

232
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,226
JEJU SAEOREUM MARATHON

233
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,563
<i>I ran every time things got too hard.</i>

234
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:39,527
<i>I wanted to hear the sound of
my heart beating.</i>

235
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,740
<i>Every time my heart beat,</i>

236
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,452
<i>I thought about how I had survived.</i>

237
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:52,499
<i>This is how badly I wanted to survive
in this ringing world</i>

238
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:56,795
<i>that wanted me to ring.</i>

239
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,120
<i>It wasn't because I hated you.</i>

240
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,290
<i>You were</i>

241
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,876
<i>just too heavy.</i>

242
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,047
<i>It was because you were too heavy.</i>

243
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,230
<i>It wasn't because I hated you.</i>

244
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:09,941
<i>You were just too heavy.</i>

245
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,735
<i>It was because you were too heavy.</i>

246
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,405
<i>It wasn't your fault.</i>

247
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,534
<i>It wasn't anyone's fault.</i>

248
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,884
<i>Scars cannot be erased.</i>

249
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,097
<i>However,</i>

250
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:31,225
<i>you make them insignificant.</i>

251
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,978
<i>You are like a tree.</i>

252
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,361
<i>When I first saw you
in the nurse's office,</i>

253
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:47,158
<i>I fled in the opposite direction
because I was scared.</i>

254
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:50,536
<i>Hye-yeong.</i>

255
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:52,913
<i>But you know,</i>

256
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,125
<i>I may have been running around an island.</i>

257
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,298
I looked horrible earlier, didn't I?

258
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,632
Crying and stuff.

259
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,309
Hye-yeong. I have a lot to say.

260
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,853
Okay. I'll listen to it all.

261
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,201
-He's here.
-He's here.

262
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,744
-He's here.
-He's here.

263
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:33,037
A word please.

264
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,164
Please give us a statement.

265
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:38,376
<i>Love Alarm's CTO, Brian Chon,
went home an hour ago</i>

266
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,503
<i>after being questioned all night.</i>

267
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:43,881
<i>The police are questioning people
associated with the Love Alarm logs,</i>

268
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:46,467
<i>and are summoning witnesses…</i>

269
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,803
<i>After the Love Alarm murder suspect
was arrested,</i>

270
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:52,139
<i>there has been heightened interest
in the Communications Privacy Act.</i>

271
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,643
<i>Many are demanding changes
to the Communications Privacy Act.</i>

272
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:07,947
Thank you.

273
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,075
C.T.O BRIAN. C

274
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,288
What do you want?

275
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:18,207
Give up on Love Alarm 2.0.

276
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:22,628
Is that why? Is that why you did this
to your big brother?

277
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,713
You ignored my wishes.

278
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,342
I told you five years ago
that we shouldn't release 2.0.

279
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,927
You don't realize

280
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,471
that the Love Alarm you created
makes people lonelier.

281
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:36,183
Version 2.0 was created
for those lonely people.

282
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,937
If they knew that there were many people
who will like them,

283
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,607
23 people would not have
committed mass suicide.

284
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,777
Is that what you really think?

285
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:55,327
Now, people will date only those
who are recommended by the app.

286
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,830
Just as we only read the articles
that appear on our search portal.

287
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,709
Just as we only watch the movies
that the algorithms recommend.

288
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,671
Why is that a problem?

289
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,549
That eliminates countless possibilities.

290
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,844
If there's an error in the suggestions,

291
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:14,430
version 2.0 will prevent love
that could have been.

292
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:17,057
An error? How will you prove that?

293
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,642
Kim Jojo.

294
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:23,397
When she installed the shield,
the person she would like changed.

295
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,317
That's just a bug.

296
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,401
It wasn't a bug.

297
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,737
It was Jojo's own volition.

298
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:33,282
With the introduction
of timing and volition,

299
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,784
this small error changed a person's life.

300
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:40,831
Do you get it now?

301
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,210
<i>Do you get it now?</i>

302
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,005
You won't know even if you look.

303
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,102
Give up on 2.0.

304
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:03,854
And remain

305
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,565
the developer forever.

306
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:24,500
ONE MONTH LATER

307
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:27,378
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

308
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,295
Hello.

309
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,672
Hi there.

310
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:30,923
That's so pretty.

311
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,299
My daughter bought it for me.

312
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,552
-Really? How nice.
-You're so lucky.

313
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:47,022
LOVE ALARM 2.0 900-DAY ANNIVERSARY

314
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,899
I'LL BE WAITING AT THE BADGE CLUB LOUNGE

315
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:50,985
This way.

316
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:28,147
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

317
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,205
What the heck?

318
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:48,208
Duk-gu?

319
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,800
Hey. What are you doing here?

320
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,720
Why are you in the Badge Club?

321
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,180
CDG.

322
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:02,848
CDG?

323
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:04,350
You?

324
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,271
Don't play games.

325
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,898
I'm the founding developer.

326
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:15,694
<i>Hold on. If he's the founding developer…</i>

327
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:17,571
<i>That means…</i>

328
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,948
When I woke up, I was in the hospital.

329
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,826
The world had changed,
but I was still the same.

330
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,454
People say I'm 23,

331
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,374
but I still feel like I'm 18.

332
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:34,380
I'm sorry

333
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,341
that I still ring your Love Alarm.

334
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:42,513
<i>Then did he create
Love Alarm because of me?</i>

335
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:44,807
<i>That's more like it.</i>

336
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:48,394
<i>I really was the muse for Love Alarm.</i>

337
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,731
Do you still hate me that much?

338
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,113
I didn't

339
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,491
hate you completely.

340
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:04,284
What was that?

341
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:06,495
What the heck?

342
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:08,414
Did I just ring your Love Alarm?

343
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:10,082
It hasn't been launched yet,

344
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:12,543
but it's what I wanted to make
once I came to.

345
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:16,088
Because it's too hard for me

346
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,216
to figure out how people feel.

347
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,263
I didn't expect you to be the beta tester.

348
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:31,478
Duk-gu.

349
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:33,730
Then…

350
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,732
were you testing me?

351
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:37,776
Why?

352
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,362
Who are you to judge people's feelings?

353
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,031
Tell me. Why?

354
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:45,993
Why do you mess with people as you please?

355
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:49,580
Do you know what I went through
to collect these hearts?

356
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:52,708
I had never worked this hard
for anything my entire life.

357
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:56,420
Who do you think you are?
What makes you so great?

358
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,922
Is it fun to live like that?

359
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,675
Whatever. Here.

360
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:03,719
Just keep your word.

361
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,054
You'd better, or else…

362
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:36,001
SUBSCRIBERS: 0

363
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:37,669
Damn it.

364
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:41,798
Did the Love Alarm
Hot People effect wear off already?

365
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,971
I should've held my temper.
He's the founding developer after all.

366
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,807
-<i>She was Love Alarm's muse?</i>
-<i>That's her claim.</i>

367
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,643
<i>She must really believe
that she was the muse.</i>

368
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:55,145
<i>Teach me how to get hearts.</i>

369
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,230
<i>Give us advice.</i>

370
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,482
<i>You're on the Hot People's list.
You're a celeb.</i>

371
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,327
Do you want to get hearts?

372
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,620
<i>Yes. How did you get them?</i>

373
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,038
<i>What's your secret?</i>

374
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:14,957
Well…

375
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,919
There's no real secret.

376
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,472
Don't lie.

377
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,141
It's humiliating if you get caught.

378
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:38,272
<i>-Does she think she's a saint?
-Drop the bull and tell us.</i>

379
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,648
<i>I'm the idiot for expecting anything.</i>

380
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,775
<i>It's so cliche,
that it actually sounded fresh.</i>

381
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,253
<i>-It's true. What the…
-Is the article true?</i>

382
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:03,046
<i>-You must be really desperate.
-Guys.</i>

383
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,466
<i>-I don't think she was lying.
-I knew it. She's amazing.</i>

384
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,843
Seriously!

385
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:11,763
I know, okay? I do!
So please, enough already!

386
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,932
-<i>She really was Love Alarm's muse?</i>
-<i>I thought she was a fraud.</i>

387
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:14,975
What's this?

388
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:23,692
WHO IS LOVE ALARM'S MUSE?
PARK, OWNER OF ONLINE SHOP LOVE MI

389
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,323
What is this?

390
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:33,327
Is this the reward?

391
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,414
Gosh…

392
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,125
At least he kept his promise.

393
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:42,586
My gosh.

394
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:45,839
I have better photos than this.

395
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,022
Viewers.

396
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:07,152
Aren't you dying to know how I first met
Love Alarm's founding developer?

397
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:11,782
I'll have to go all the way back
to high school then.

398
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:16,078
I was insanely popular
when I was in high school.

399
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,264
Do you have a shoot?

400
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:37,933
What about lunch?

401
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,143
I'm not hungry.

402
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:42,604
Where's Dad?

403
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,607
Probably trying to get a nomination again.

404
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:00,872
They say this makes them live longer.

405
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:32,571
You must be busy.

406
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:36,366
Yes.

407
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,165
I guess it'll be even harder to see you.

408
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,877
Are you still worried about me?

409
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,633
There's no need.

410
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:56,720
You've gained

411
00:50:58,722 --> 00:50:59,765
a lot as well now.

412
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,269
I'll take care of myself somehow.

413
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:08,064
And if it gets too hard…

414
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,232
Let's meet here.

415
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,321
We'll just do that.

416
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:52,442
NEW MOVIE ANNOUNCEMENT

417
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,194

420
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,832
<i>I'm here to check the gas meter.</i>

421
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:23,617
2023, APRIL 22, SATURDAY, 2:30 P.M.

422

2023, APRIL 22, SATURDAY, 2:30 P.M.

423
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:36,171
2023, APRIL 27, THURSDAY, 2:27 P.M.

424
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:38,214
2023, MAY 2, TUESDAY, 2:30 P.M.

425
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:51,436
2023, MAY 13, SATURDAY, 2:25 P.M.

426
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:53,897
2023, MAY 15, MONDAY, 2:15 P.M.

427
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,691
2023, MAY 21, SUNDAY, 2:30 P.M.

428
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,234
2023, MAY 26, FRIDAY, 2:27 P.M.

429
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:01,029
2023, MAY 27, SATURDAY, 2:30 P.M.

430
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:04,658
2023, MAY 27, SATURDAY, 2:30 P.M.

431
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,459
<i>It's been…</i>

432
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:18,046
<i>over a month already.</i>

433
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:24,386
<i>There are no more videos.</i>

434
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:44,364
2023, MAY 28, SATURDAY, 2:30 P.M.

435
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:01,149
I still can't ring yours.

436
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:07,030
But I'll come back.

437
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:09,616
Tomorrow,

438
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,410
and the day after that.

439
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:14,954
If I keep doing that,

440
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:17,957
maybe one day,

441
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:21,252
I'll be able to ring it.

442
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,963
<i>Should we make a list?</i>

443
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:14,347
Did you write a lot?

444
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:16,850
<i>Pay attention when the other person</i>

445
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,185
<i>talks about something they like
even if it's boring.</i>

446
00:57:20,436 --> 00:57:21,980
<i>Sit with the other person</i>

447
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:24,899
<i>when they are eating what they like
even if you're not eating.</i>

448
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,401
<i>If the other person is sick or lonely,</i>

449
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:29,237
<i>stay with that person
even if he or she says it's fine.</i>

450
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:31,406
Is there anything else?

451
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,912
You forgot the most important thing.

452
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,165
What's that?

453
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,126
"I love you.

454
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:47,839
Tell each other that."

455
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,094
It's nicer saying it myself.

456
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,565
I love you too.

457
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:38,973
<i>Hi Jojo, it's me, Chon Duk-gu.</i>

458
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:47,482
Why did you want to meet
in a place like this?

459
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:52,278
They always have secret meetings
in places like this in the movies.

460
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:55,156
You're so silly.

461
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:59,661
I plan to start over here.

462
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:09,254
Do you regret creating Love Alarm?

463
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:12,549
I don't regret it

464
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:15,969
since someone else would have
even if I didn't.

465
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:19,931
Look at the teenagers.

466
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:24,686
Love Alarm existed before they started
becoming interested in the opposite sex.

467
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,064
Their first relationships started
by ringing Love Alarms.

468
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:32,610
To them, Love Alarm
is as natural as breathing the air.

469
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:37,323
When this building was first built,

470
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,617
it was probably
built with the latest technology.

471
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,371
Things feel strange and new
only for a moment.

472
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:46,708
You get used to it right away,
like it was always there,

473
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:48,710
and it becomes old just as quickly.

474
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:51,546
That's how technology is.

475
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,674
It was released because it was time.

476
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,469
Jojo.

477
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,931
It was obvious that you liked Hye-yeong.

478
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,976
Do you know why you were so unsure?

479
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:09,647
Because I--

480
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:13,192
Because you never saw
his Love Alarm ring, that's why.

481
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:17,280
Although you knew
it was because of the shield,

482
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:21,951
you kept doubting your feelings
because you never rang his Love Alarm.

483
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:26,331
That's why I wanted
to stop the new function.

484
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:30,793
Because people had
too much faith in machines.

485
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:38,676
Still, I'm sure you could have known
if you wanted to.

486
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:40,762
How?

487
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:42,597
The moment you liked him,

488
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:46,976
your name would have disappeared from
the list of people who will like him.

489
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:59,447
<i>I don't know if this will help you,</i>

490
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,700
<i>but this is all I can do for you.</i>

491
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:14,379
Come in.

492
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:23,096
Let's look at this.

493
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:26,933
KIM JOJO

494
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,309
It's my log.

495
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:30,853
It has all the times
I rang someone's Love Alarm.

496
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,400
My feelings that were hidden by the spear

497
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:37,568
and the shield.

498
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:39,529
KIM JOJO

499
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:44,951
It may not work
because I'm missing a part.

500
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:48,329
Still, let's try. Who knows? It may work.

501
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:57,338
Why do you think
Duk-gu saved the log on this?

502
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:02,260
The Voyager,
which left Earth 40 years ago,

503
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:05,346
uses an eight-track cassette deck
to save its data.

504
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:08,558
And the Voyager is still flying up there.

505
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,643
That's what Duk-gu said.

506
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:17,400
Does it mean that it's tough and durable?

507
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:19,068
Maybe.

508
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,907
Gosh, I'm a little nervous.

509
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:27,076
Me too.

510
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:29,704
Should we not look then?

511
01:02:29,787 --> 01:02:32,248
I know that you like me.

512
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:37,253
Still, I think we should check.

513
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:12,997
What the…

514
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,957
I thought it was supposed to be durable.

515
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:18,419
Well, I guess it doesn't work after all.

516
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:25,676
Then…

517
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,097
should we go eat?

518
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,432
I'm hungry, actually.

519
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:34,310
Sure.

520
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:35,937
Let's go.

521
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:52,954
What do you want to eat?

522
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:55,331
I don't know. Anything you want to eat.

523
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,631
Let's throw all of that away.

524
01:04:04,423 --> 01:04:05,424
Should we?

525
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,336
JEJU SAEOREUM MARATHON

526
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,338
2023, APRIL 23, SUNDAY, 11:20 A.M.

527
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,353
2023, APRIL 23, SUNDAY, 11:20 A.M.

528
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:05,192
2023, APRIL 13, THURSDAY, 8:52 P.M.

529
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:14,201
