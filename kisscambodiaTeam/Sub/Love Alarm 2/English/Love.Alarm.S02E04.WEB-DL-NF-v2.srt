00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:46,796
<i>There's no way</i>

3
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:16,182
<i>you want to see them
and hear their voice more.</i>

4
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,894
<i>So all of your senses
point toward that person</i>

5
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,147
<i>before you even realize it.</i>

6
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,234
<i>As that occurs repeatedly,</i>

7
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:28,403
<i>a path is created.</i>

8
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,615
<i>A path to where my heart is headed.</i>

9
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,283
See?

10
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:16,910
You like me.

11
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,047
It's different when you like someone.

12
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,842
The eyes don't lie.

13
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,262
You were like that before too.

14
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,556
That shield…

15
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,475
It was because of me.

16
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,603
To hide your feelings for me.

17
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,316
Sun-oh.

18
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,486
-That was--
-You installed it as you pleased,

19
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,238
and hid as you pleased.

20
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,657
You didn't even give me time to prepare.

21
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,618
Look properly into your heart now.

22
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,038
I won't let you go anymore

23
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,959
without understanding why.

24
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,400
<i>It's raining all of a sudden.</i>

25
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,861
<i>Did you bring an umbrella?</i>

26
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,867
<i>Should I pick you up when you're done?</i>

27
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,946
Hye-yeong.

28
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,617
Everyone's swamped because of the news,
so finish it up quickly.

29
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,285
Yes, sir.

30
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,872
Jang In-su's so lucky.

31
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,583
He took a day off on a day like this.

32
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,126
JANG IN-SU

33
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,256
<i>Don't worry.</i>

34
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,676
I made them delete their pictures
while you were out.

35
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,178
I took their pictures too,

36
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,639
so that they can't post them anywhere.

37
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,809
<i>Where will you run to this time?</i>

38
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,147
<i>Look properly into your heart now.</i>

39
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,070
But

40
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,990
can you meet your boyfriend like this?

41
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:45,493
I want to.

42
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,247
I'm going to meet him and tell him.

43
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,374
That's the right thing to do.

44
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,960
And the shield.

45
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,755
I'll tell him why I have it.

46
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,242
When did you get here?

47
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,705
I've been running around all day.

48
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,332
You saw the news, right?

49
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,250
Because of that, the company--

50
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:58,334
<i>The police keep requesting
Love Alarm's logs related to the murder.</i>

51
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:59,627
<i>What should we do?</i>

52
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,798
We told them that our records
are automatically expunged.

53
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:07,593
<i>They somehow obtained information
that certain logs are stored separately.</i>

54
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,534
WILL THE POLICE INVESTIGATE LOVE ALARM HQ?

55
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,375
HATERS OF LOVE ALARM

56
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,754
THE REAL LOVE ALARM DEVELOPER

57
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:51,971
<i>Then who are you?</i>

58
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,974
I was told that the developer
could get rid of it.

59
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,559
Are you really…

60
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:58,769
the developer?

61
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,826
Is your mother doing okay?

62
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,245
Yes.

63
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,080
I'm glad.

64
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,501
What about you? Are you okay?

65
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,419
Of course.

66
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,386
It's spring, but it's still cold.

67
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,680
-Isn't it?
-It is.

68
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,625
Take it with you.
It's supposed to keep raining.

69
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,837
Here.

70
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,012
I had one too.

71
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:25,940
Bye.

72
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,776
Bye.

73
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:42,623
<i>I couldn't tell him anything</i>

74
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,667
<i>after all.</i>

00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,961

You looked like

85
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,200
<i>The police are having a hard time</i>

-<i>People's interest in Love Alarm log…</i>
-I don't know.

88
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,540
Who knows what she's doing?

89
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,584
She said strange things
about Love Alarm's founding developer.

90
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,462
I feel like maybe this time,
it'll be different.

91
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,415
CDG HAS LEFT THE CHAT.

92
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,805

00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:11,624
<i>Mon-sun.</i>

95
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,918
<i>How do you think you'd feel</i>

96
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,545
<i>if your boyfriend
didn't ring your Love Alarm?</i>

97
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,423
<i>How else?</i>

98
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:24,011
If it doesn't ring,
I'd assume he doesn't like me.

99
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,180
He says he likes you,

100
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,809
but there's a reason why he won't ring it.

101
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,063
It should ring if he likes me.

102
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,398
What reason could there be?

103
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,861
Whatever it may be,
I'd feel lonely if it didn't ring.

104
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,446
And nervous.

105
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,327
Ever since Love Alarm was released,
no one says, "I love you" anymore.

106
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,332
Because the sound of Love Alarm
ringing means "I love you."

107
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,210
<i>If it doesn't ring,</i>

108
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,671
<i>it means he doesn't love me.</i>

109

110
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,856
<i>Who sent this to me?</i>

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,962

Oh, boy.

113
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,204
-Mom!
-Oh my gosh. You scared me.

114
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:15,956
Why are you so shocked?

115
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,125
I said I'd watch the store. Go home.

116
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,376
I can't trust you.

117
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,545
It's not like you ever kept your word.

118
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,465
Come on. Don't be like that.
You saw my proposal.

119
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:27,051
-Take this off.
-Why…

120
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,428
You're up to something. I know it.

121
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,554
I'm not up to anything.

122
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,890
Just go out and play while I tell you to.

123
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,141
Oh my gosh.

124
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,905
Wouldn't that be nice?

125
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,664
Why is she looking at them so enviously?

126
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,383
<i>The Congressman has been

<i>The opposing party seems to have noticed
and are taking action.</i>

129
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:23,899
Did you see her?

130
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,776
Stop talking about Yuk-jo.

131
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,361
I was talking about Jojo.

132
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,281
It was the first time
I saw you smile like that.

133
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:37,413
I realized I had met her before.

134
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:43,168
When you got hurt in Jeju,
she came to see me.

135
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,968
You should be with someone you like.

136
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,726
Don't let him in!

137
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,187
Throw away his phone too!

138
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:34,321
Cause trouble again before the election,
and I'll ship you off to the US!

<i>I could've gone out if I really wanted to.</i>

140

00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,431
<i>we would continue to be together.</i>

142
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,130
How long will you follow me?

143
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,012
Why didn't you tell me?

144
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,933
-If you're talking about the shield--
-No.

145
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:49,229
I heard you came to my house
before you broke up with me.

146
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,565
You should've told me.

147
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,027
What happened to you that day?

148
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,779
Is your shield

149
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,616
my fault entirely?

150
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,492
It's not your fault.

151
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,370
I don't get it. I don't understand it.

152
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,498
Tell me

153
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,627
so that I can understand why.

154
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,759
It's hot today, isn't it?

155
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,594
-It is.
-It is.

156
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,429
You just had lunch, so you're sleepy.

157
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,639
-Yes.
-Yes.

158
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,932
Do you want to study?

159
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,600
-No!
-No!

160
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,143
Should I just cancel the class?

161
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,274
Seriously. You hate being in class.

162
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,486
But you still need to learn.

163
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,790

177

00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,005
My gosh. You must be tired.
Want some help?

181
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,631
It's okay. It's faster if I do it.

182
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,177
<i>What?</i>

183
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,765
<i>What about this?</i>

184
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,435
Here. Have one.

185
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,978
It's okay. I drink it all the time.

186
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,981
That looks very tiring.

187
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,162
That's right.

188
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,624
-I checked everything.
-Have a nice day.

189
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,049
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

190
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,344
Gosh. Why won't it work?

191
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,316
I'M FROM YUK-JO'S MAKEUP TEAM

192
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,029
<i>We haven't been able to reach Yuk-jo
for two days.</i>

193
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,656
<i>She didn't come to the meetings.</i>

194
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,954
<i>She has never done this before.</i>

195
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,373
Hey, Sun-oh. What's up?

196
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:20,000
I heard you've been unreachable.

197
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,295
-Everyone's--
-Did they call you?

198
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,173
People don't know yet.

199
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,050
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

200
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,772
Sorry, but someone's waiting for me,
so I have to go.

201
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:46,985
Who is that?

202
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,240
Someone

203
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,118
who rings my Love Alarm.

204
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,946
I think this is nice too.

205
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,824
Even if you don't ring my Love Alarm,

206
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,369
we still get to go on dates.

207
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:05,814
It's so pretty.

208
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,484
What's wrong?

209
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,990
I wonder if this is how he felt too.

210
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,872
Not being happy at all.

211
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,260
Dang it.

212
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,888
Hey, what are you doing?

213
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:40,932
What are you looking at?

214
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,435
Let me see.

215
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,529
<i>-Is she Hwang Sun-oh's mistress?
-I bet she seduced him.</i>

216
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:55,864
<i>But why? He has Lee Yuk-jo.</i>

217
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,033
She goes to Yeolrim University.
Do we know anything else?

218
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:05,999
What's wrong with him?

219
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,086
Is Love Alarm more important to you
than friends?

220
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,213
You disloyal punks.

221
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:14,924
Put that down.

222
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,138
What are you looking at?

223
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,268
Put it down.

224
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,484
Hey! Where are you going?

225
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:39,741
<i>That's her.</i>

226
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,702
<i>-Look at her. She thinks she's pretty.
-Is she Jojo?</i>

227
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,163
<i>-What's her major?
-I thought she had a boyfriend.</i>

228
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,590
Pick up.

229
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:40,677
Jojo.

230
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,804
<i>Jojo left her phone.</i>

231
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,440
DAD

232
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,613
<i>You brat. It's that girl again, isn't it?</i>

233
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,995
<i>Sun-oh, look at this.</i>

234
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,799
Jojo, were you still seeing Sun-oh?

235
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,011
While seeing Hye-yeong?

236
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:24,888
Seriously.

237
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,057
She's kind of cool.

238
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,399
What's with him now?

239
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,361
Seriously, what's wrong with them?

240
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,077
Hey.

241
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:51,748
I can't reach Jojo.
Do you know where she is?

242
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,583
I don't know.

243
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,377
Probably with Sun-oh.

244
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,798
Gosh, you…

245
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,926
What? Are you wondering
how I never change?

246
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,429
Tell her to call me if you see her.

247
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:07,514
Please.

248
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:09,307
You are impressive.

249
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,060
How do you never change?

250
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,400
Sure, you're better than Sun-oh.

251
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,985
Yes. Good luck.

252
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,129
Where's Jojo?

253
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,344
You self-centered prick.
All you care about is yourself.

254
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,054
You're the one who's self-centered.

255
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,931
Do you know how hard it is for Jojo
because of you?

256
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:56,646
You think you know everything, don't you?
You don't know anything.

257
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:57,647
Why you…

258
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:09,075
Jojo is terrified of people
looking at her.

259
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,661
Think before you do something!

260
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,330
Stop assuming you know everything!

261
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:18,543
I was willing to lose everything I have
when I went to her.

262
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:19,627
Exactly.

263
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,965
You only thought about yourself,
and how you were feeling.

264
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,467
You didn't think about
what it would do to Jojo.

265
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,385
You're the one

266
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,179
who only cares about how you feel

267
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,057
and can't see anything else.

268
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,650
Forget it.

269
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:13,890
Jojo!

270
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,737
Are you okay?

271
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,739
I was worried
because I couldn't reach you.

272
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,418
What happened to you?

273
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,504
It's nothing.

274
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,130
Are you okay?

275
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,593
How is this nothing?

276
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,556
How could you worry about me right now?

277
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,392
Aren't you mad?

278
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:05,233
You're so stupid. You should be mad.

279
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,111
I'm your girlfriend,

280
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,113
but I keep hurting you

281
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,615
and keep so many things from you.

282
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,160
So I always make you feel lonely.

283
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:20,540
Then

284
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,960
you should get mad, argue,
and fight with me.

285
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,469
Okay.

286
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,139
I'll do that from now on,

287
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,225
so don't be mad.

288
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,501
It's a bit messy.

289
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,713
I'm trying to fix this.

290
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,008
It's a nice distraction

291
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,218
and makes time fly.

292
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,313
IAM DISTRICT COURT

293
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,399
Vintage is just a fancy word for junk.

294
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,527
You feel like everything will go well

295
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,446
if you fix this.

296
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:45,166
I couldn't get the necessary part,

297
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,086
so I tried to think of a workaround,

298
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:52,590
but I…

299
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,510
Why can't I throw away
something that's broken?

300
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,765
Is it because it's like me?

301
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,293
Look at me.

302
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:47,061
<i>It's because
I can't give him the assurance.</i>

303
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,361
<i>That's why Hye-yeong keeps
trying and trying</i>

304
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,072
<i>to make himself believe.</i>

305
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,908
<i>But still, he gets anxious.</i>

306
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:09,000
<i>Hye-yeong, say what's on your mind too.
It's quite satisfying.</i>

307
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,553
Kim Jojo!

308
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,602
Kim Jojo!

309
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,273
Kim Jojo!

310
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:46,913
ALLOWS YOU TO RING THE LOVE ALARM
OF A PERSON OF YOUR CHOOSING

311
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,581
WILL YOU USE THE SPEAR?
NO, YES

312
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,322
Why is Jojo so lucky?

313
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:26,577
She doesn't do anything,
but she has two guys

314
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:29,538
taking turns ringing her Love Alarm
here and then.

315
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,999
Meanwhile, I'm doing all this
just to get a heart.

316
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,835
Gross! Dang it.

317
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,923
Gosh. How will I do this every day?

318
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,385
I'm losing my mind after just one day.

319
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,684
Mom did this for 20 years.

320
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,447
It's so hard.

321
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,409
How does everyone endure it and work?

322
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,035
Every day…

323
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,667
I worked all day long today,

324
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,795
and I think people are amazing.

325
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:36,981
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

326
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,695
Now? Why?

327
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,989
But why? What won him over?

328
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,783
What are you doing here?

329
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,495
Why is someone like you--

330
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,038
I wasn't thinking straight.

331
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,750
-I don't care anymore.
-Sun-oh.

332
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,293
We would've been perfectly fine

333
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,837
if Love Alarm didn't exist.

334
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,590
I believed in that piece of crap

335
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,052
and lost you like an idiot.

336
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,473
No.

337
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,851
It wasn't because of Love Alarm.

338
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,437
It was my choice.

339
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,239
Sun-oh.

340
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,867
When you came to my school,

341
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,413
I…

342
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,125
All I could think about was Hye-yeong.

343
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,088
Even when that video went viral…

344
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,258
The old me…

345
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,679
would've only thought about running away.

346
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,349
But back then,

347
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,352
I could only think about
how hurt Hye-yeong must be

348
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,063
and I knew I had to go to him.

349
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,774
That was all I could think about.

350
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,446
Are you…

351
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,039
Sun-oh.

352
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,251
Look into my eyes.

353
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,590
This isn't Love Alarm.
It's my own volition.

354
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,759
And this is how I truly feel.

355
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,931
You know about who likes who,
and things like that.

356
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:19,518
So…

357
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,564
tell me.

358
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:28,360
Who…

359
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,156
do I like right now?

360
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,249
Hey.

361
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,503
You got mail.

362
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:34,051
Who develops photos in this day and age?

363
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,624
And you stayed out all night. You brat.

364
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,174
Earlier, Hye-yeong and Sun-oh were…

365
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,262
Why did they have to fight
in our neighborhood?

366
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,890
They're so stupid.

367
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,710
What's wrong? Why aren't you taking it?

368
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:50,628
What?

369
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,338
Nothing.

370
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:16,236
I saw the viral video of you
and Sun-oh in the classroom,

371
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:21,950
so I thought you dumped Hye-yeong.
I guess you didn't.

372
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,622
Gosh. You shouldn't be so obvious
about liking someone.

373
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,415
You're so annoying.

374
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,505
It's so obvious.

375
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,313
Where are you going now?

376
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:05,786
<i>If I can't see a path,
I can just make one myself.</i>

377
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,504
<i>Hye-yeong, can we meet up for a minute?</i>

378
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,380
Hye-yeong!

379
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,340
Don't come. Stay right there.

380
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:20,045
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

381
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,520
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

382
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:58,875
<i>In this world,</i>

383
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,795
<i>if you like someone, it has to ring.</i>

384
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:08,135
<i>For the first time ever,
I told Hye-yeong that I love him.</i>

385
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,993
BASED ON <i>LOVE ALARM</i> BY CHON KYE YOUNG
