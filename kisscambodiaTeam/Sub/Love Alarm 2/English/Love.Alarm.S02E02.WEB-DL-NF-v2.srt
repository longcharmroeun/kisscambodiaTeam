3
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,127
We'll leave that up to you.

4
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,088
No, not based on grades.

5
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,175
Give it to students
who can't afford to pay for school lunch.

6
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,344
To the students who really need it.

7
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:58,433
My gosh. I had no idea
Sun-oh was so thoughtful.

8
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:02,312
It must be because his father is
a great person. He learned from him.

9
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,982
Of course.

10
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,859
Shall we take a picture?

11
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,486
Come here, Sun-oh.

12
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,780
-Come this way.
-Come on. Let's take a picture.

13
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,282
Okay.

14
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,576
Okay.

15
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,787
Sun-oh, smile a little.

16
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,664
Seriously.

17
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,959
Here, why don't you hold this?

18
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,252
-My gosh!
-Oh no.

19
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,379
-Oh no.
-Are you okay?

20
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,464
Goodness.

21
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,632
Are you okay?

22
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,133
My gosh.

23
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:35,261
Which foot is it?

24
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,138
Oh no.

25
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,181

What are you doing here?

30
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,391
I came to meet our teacher…

31
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,146
What about Hye-yeong?

32
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,316
Is he doing well?

33
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,572
He's doing well.

34
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,575
What about you?

35
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,453
Are you

36
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,205
doing well?

37
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,294
I should go.

38
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,338
I wonder if this is it.

00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,633

00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,762

But why do you want his address?

44
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,938
I need to ask him something.

45
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,156
Jojo. Didn't you know?

46
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,829
Duk-gu…

47
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,458
<i>What do you mean? Chon Duk-gu's dead?</i>

48
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,796

49
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,927
<i>Should I come to you? I'll come right now.</i>

50
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,804
No.

51
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,144
That's not it.

52
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,398
I just…

53
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,609
I just hate myself, that's why.

54
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,530
<i>What do you mean, you hate yourself?</i>

55
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,455
<i>When I heard that Duk-gu was dead,</i>

56
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,792
<i>I was afraid of the fact
that I may be unable to</i>

57
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,587
<i>get rid of the shield.</i>

58
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,008
Yes.

59
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,218

60
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,429

61
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,139
Yes.

00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,440
That's what it'll say.

65
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,317
Yes, sir.

66
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,702
She came to look for
someone named Chon Duk-gu.

67
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,079
Do you know him?

68
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,455
Chon Duk-gu?

69
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,123
Figures.

70
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,085
You don't remember anyone
but her and Hye-yeong.

71
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:21,172
She just came to ask
for her classmate's contact information.

72
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,925
I guess she needs him or something.

73
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,010
-For what?
-Hey.

74
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:29,889
She's Hye-yeong's girlfriend.
Why do you care?

75
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,350
What you must do now

76
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:35,269
is think about how to pass that audition.

77
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,855
Although you'll probably fail.

78
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,318
At least pretend
to read the script and practice.

79
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,446

90
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,386

your father was here.

00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:51,971

What?

00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,702
Don't follow me. It's embarrassing.

Wait for me, Jojo!

116
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,669
Have you ever been on a plane at night?

00:11:58,968 --> 00:11:59,802
I haven't.

121
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,939
I wonder how the world looks
from up there.

122
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,441
It's probably all black, right?

123
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,153
We'll probably look like
the night sky from above.

124
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,865
The city lights may look like stars.

125
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:33,878
What?

126
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,843
Should we look together next time?

127
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:42,970
At what?

128
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,347
The night sky.

129
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,478
Let's look down together from that plane.

130
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,648
Let's see whether or not
the city lights look like stars.

131
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,526
Okay.

00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,572

00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,118

00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,349
Damn it. He failed again.

137
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,685
Why does he bother with acting then?
My gosh.

138
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,980
Explain to your father
so he doesn't get upset, okay?

139
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,443
I'm sorry, sir.

140
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,612
I'll make sure he practices hard.

141
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,406

142
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:49,995

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,748

00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,877

145
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,227

146
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,388

147
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,890
Don't eat it.

148
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,311
Does it taste good?

149
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,770
No.

150
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,403
Should I go

151
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,447
to the event tomorrow too?

152
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:07,907
Really?

153
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,369
But the event will be full of reporters.

154
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,541
Really? What's gotten into you?

155
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,501
What do you mean?

156
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,964
How can someone change so drastically?

157
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,091
They say people only change when…

158
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,387
You're not sick, are you?

159
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,641
I don't want you to be sick.

160
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,708
Hye-yeong, is it nice to be working?

161
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,293
Well…

162
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,419
I'm not sure yet.

163
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,672
Maybe it will be once I get paid.

164
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,635
Have you met the CTO?

165
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,387

166
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,347
I haven't met him yet.

167
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,183
I heard he doesn't like meeting people.

168
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,227
I see.

169
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,731
We're here already.

170
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,529
That weirdo hasn't been back, has he?

171
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,030
Of course not.

172
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,198
Even if he does, I'll…

173
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:32,866

174
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,584

175
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,754
Okay. Good night.

00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:03,814

177
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,610
I'm going to

178
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,447
keep liking you!

179
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,452
But you don't have to.

180
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:21,874
I mean…

181
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,668
You don't have to feel pressured.

182
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,590

00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,798
What time is the Badge Club
press conference tomorrow?

188
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,509
<i>It's from 4 to 6 p.m.</i>

189
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,845
What do I have before then?

190
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,224
<i>There's a shareholders' meeting
until 4 p.m.</i>

191
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,275
<i>I'd like to meet the developer.</i>

192
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,740
<i>I heard you co-developed Love Alarm.</i>

193
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,742
<i>-Please help me.
-Answer me, will you?</i>

194
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,327
<i>-Check your emails.
-If you can't mail me, call me.</i>

195
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,704
<i>-Read them!
-You fraud!</i>

196
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,963
What an ass.

197
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,593
<i>Please read my emails.
I wrote to you so many times.</i>

198
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,971
This won't work either.

199
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,225
Please read them. Why won't you read them?

200
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,685
I wrote so many already.

201
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,354
Please read them.

202
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,856
I KNOW I'M PESTERING YOU, BUT

203
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:11,984
What's this?

204
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:16,113
IT'S GROWN UNBEARABLY LARGE

205
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,614
Gosh.

206
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,409
Jojo posted something again.

207
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,912
But she said she didn't want
to become famous.

208
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,331
She's a total attention seeker.

209
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,541
<i>Are you making a comeback?</i>

210
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:30,169
<i>What's with the shield? I'm scared
that something might happen again.</i>

211
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,629
<i>There's no need to be.
She's just looking for attention.</i>

212
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,839
<i>You're a moron if you fell for it.</i>

213
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,758
<i>The 23 people thing was a coincidence.
It's not a prophecy.</i>

214
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,441
<i>It isn't a prophecy?</i>

215
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:56,612
<i>You don't know anything,
so stop running your mouths.</i>

216
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,841
<i>Jojo!</i>

217
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,385
I'm going to

218
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,472
keep liking you!

219
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,267
But you don't have to.

220
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,312
<i>You don't have to feel pressured.</i>

221
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,881
Oh, my back. Why does it hurt so much?

222
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,175
Damn it.

223
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,344
Gosh, darn it.

224
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,013
People are meant to sleep on beds.

225
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,684
What was that?

226
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,312
Hey, Jojo.

227
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,397
When did you come in?

228
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,650
You saw me
and tried to scare me, didn't you?

229
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,153
My back's in so much pain right now.

230
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,738
Hey!

231
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:22,739
Are you ignoring me?

232
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,368
Damn it. She always ignores me.

233
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,538
This is so comfortable.

234
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,213
YEOLRIM HIGH SCHOOL

235
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,759
Jeez, I thought she was Mom.

236
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,144
What?

237
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,404
Mon-sun.

238
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,666
-Jojo.
-Yes?

239
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,376
Do you want to live with me?

240
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,503
Move in with me. Please?

241
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,131
I'll be good to you. Please?

242
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,468
<i>Hello, this is Brian Chon.</i>

243
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,844
Are you meeting Brian Chon?

244
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,055
<i>You're the artist of
</i>The Ringing World<i>, right?</i>

245
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,765
<i>I'll wait for you
in the Love Alarm office.</i>

246
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:30,891
Oh, my.

247
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,311
Today's technology really is impressive.
Take a look.

248
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,899
No matter how advanced
medical technology is,

249
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,109
you can't move your eyes, nose, and mouth.

250
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,987
You can check whether or not it's him
using these proportions.

251
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:48,200
But why are you comparing them?
Didn't Chon Duk-gu already--

252
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,159
Just because.

253
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,286
I can't believe it, that's why.

254
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,040
It is kind of strange.

255
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,292
Hold on.

256
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,047
You said he created the app
because he liked your cousin.

257
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,215
Yes.

258
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,382
Where is it?

259
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,265
Look at this.

260
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,394
Brian Chon also said he made Love Alarm
because of a crush.

261
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,313
LOVE ALARM WAS CREATED FOR A CRUSH I HAD

262
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,901
As I expected.

263
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,069
What?

264
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:27,114
I'd believe you
if you told me they were brothers.

265
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,282
How did he change this much?

266
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,909
He was cute to begin with.

267
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:35,372
But why did he reply all of a sudden?

268
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:38,125
He ignored you all this time
when you asked him to meet.

269
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,502
I'll find out once I meet him.

270
00:23:58,895 --> 00:23:59,896
Why are you in here?

271
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,734
You still haven't learned anything.
I said not to come back here.

272
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:08,238
-Get out now! Now!
-Mom!

273
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:11,116
What happened at the station?
Did you get your money back?

274
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,492
Mom, what do I do now?

275
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,869
What? Why? What now?

276
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:17,289
He said he was a founding developer
of Love Alarm, but he won't call me.

277
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,957
"Founding developer"? What are you saying?

278
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,003
I got an email address
in exchange for dropping the charges.

279
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:23,920
Okay.

280
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,089
-But he's not writing me back.
-You dropped…

281
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,258
Hey. What about the money?

282
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,468
Should I just drop dead somewhere?

283
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,637
Did you get the money or not?

284
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,347
Is that all that matters to you?

285
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,891
You didn't get it.

286
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:39,186
Gosh, you moron!

287
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,689
That brat. What's wrong with her?

288
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:46,484
I'm so stressed out.

289
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,071
It's so annoying.

290
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,119
What did I do wrong?

291
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,814
I'm so annoyed. Seriously.

292
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:38,328
Welcome to BJ Gul-mi's
awesome shopping mall,

293
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,955
<i>Love Mi.</i>

294
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,832
<i>I have lots of pretty clothes
to show you today.</i>

295
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,626
<i>So please look forward to it.</i>

296
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,295
CDG HAS ENTERED THE CHAT

297
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,713
Well…

298
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,509
Just a minute, please.

299
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:41,785
I'm off.

300
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,119
Okay. Bye.

301
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,579
-Bye.
-Call me.

302
00:27:58,676 --> 00:27:59,511
<i>Jojo.</i>

303
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,556
<i>There's no other shield like this
in the entire world.</i>

304
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,771
YOUR HEART IS SAFE NOW

305
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,773
<i>You can't tell anyone about this.</i>

306
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,029
<i>There's a chance</i>

307
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,408
<i>I could get rid of the shield.</i>

308
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:30,333
<i>I can finally put everything
back into place.</i>

309
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,464
<i>Hye-yeong, did you sleep well?</i>

310
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,717
<i>I'm starting work late today.</i>

311
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,846
<i>Want to meet up for a bit at night?</i>

312
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,603
<i>Tonight?</i>

313
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,524
<i>Why? Is today a bad day?</i>

314
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,986
<i>You must be tired from working.</i>

315
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:03,199
<i>Yes. Sorry. I think so.</i>

316
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,495
<i>Then stay at home and rest up.
I'll call you.</i>

317
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:09,539
<i>Okay.</i>

318
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,484
STRAIGHT FROM THE FARM
SWEET FRUITS

319
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,096
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

320
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,111
<i>The number you have dialed
is currently out of reach.</i>

321
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,906
<i>You will be directed to voicemail
after the beep.</i>

322
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,319
Let's go around the back.

323
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,413
I LEFT STRAWBERRIES AT YOUR DOOR. ENJOY!

324
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,465
Over here!

325
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,009
No, over here!

326
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:32,932
LOVE ALARM 2.0 100-DAY ANNIVERSARY

327
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,350
There they come.

328
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,894
Look over here, please.

329
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,061
-Ms. Lee.
-Over here.

330
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,063
-Mr. Hwang Sun-oh. Over here.
-Sun-oh.

331
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,899
I had a really good dream last night.

332
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:41,858
What was it about?

333
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:43,610
I'll tell you later.

334
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:44,569
Look this way.

335
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,321
If it comes true.

336
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,453
Please come this way.

337
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,670
Yuk-jo, please give your interview first.

338
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,302
Once the reporter comes,

339
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:12,221
you can talk about what's changed
since the 2.0 update.

340
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,222
What's changed?

341
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:17,435
How many showed up
as people who love you, for example.

342
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,562
Things people may want to know.

343
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,483
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

344
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,234
PEOPLE WHO WILL LOVE YOU
KIM JOJO

345
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:45,672
Make yourself comfortable in the VIP room
until the event starts.

346
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:49,550
Go ahead.

347
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,636
This way, please.

348
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,357
Kim Jojo?

349
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,846
Tell me

350
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,723
why you wanted to meet me.

351
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:45,940
When I was in high school,
a developer gave me a gift.

352
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,736
I was told it was the only one
in the entire world,

353
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,280
and that I might need it.

354
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:56,909
Do you remember?

355
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,664
The shield?

356
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,333
Duk-gu.

357
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,462
You're Duk-gu, aren't you?

358
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,133
Anyway, what about the shield?

359
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,766
I want to get rid of it.

360
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:26,314
You wanted to hide your feelings
while seeing how others felt.

361
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,900
That's why you chose to install it.

362
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,903
So why would you get rid of it now?

363
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,947
Not letting people know your feelings
puts you in a position of power.

364
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,203
I have to

365
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,455
get rid of the shield.

366
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,917
Is that why you posted that
on <i>The Ringing World</i>?

367
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,130
You should stop now.

368
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,382
You can't get rid of it anyway

369
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,134
since Duk-gu's gone.

370
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,973
Then who are you?

371
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,310
I was told that the developer
could get rid of it.

372
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,104
Are you really…

373
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,106
the developer?

374
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:19,242
Whether or not I'm the developer,
whether or not I'm Duk-gu,

375
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,286
I can't get rid of the shield.

376
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,340
<i>I'll get off here.</i>

377
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,093
<i>As long as the shield is there,</i>

378
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,054
<i>there's no way I can be sure
of my feelings.</i>

379
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:26,726
<i>Does this mean I can never be honest
for the rest of my life?</i>

380
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,331
What was that about a shield?

381
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,083
What is a shield?

382
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,547
Explain.

383
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,013
My Love Alarm didn't ring
because of that shield.

384
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,349
Is that it?

385
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:10,895
Tell me.

386
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:14,941
I'm sorry.

387
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,489
Why are you sorry?

388
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,326
Why do you need to apologize?

389
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:31,958
Does Hye-yeong know?

390
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,329
Inmate 3308, you have a visitor.

391
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,862
So you're Hye-yeong.

392
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,253
Mom.

393
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,006
Do I look a lot like Dad?

394
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:07,219
<i>If you want to know what your father
was like, look in the mirror.</i>

395
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,242
<i>Maybe…</i>

396
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,119
<i>That's why…</i>

397
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:38,292
<i>That's why I thought
Dad may be a good person.</i>

398
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,627
<i>I thought</i>

399
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,924
<i>that I may be a good person,</i>

400
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,301
<i>Jojo.</i>
