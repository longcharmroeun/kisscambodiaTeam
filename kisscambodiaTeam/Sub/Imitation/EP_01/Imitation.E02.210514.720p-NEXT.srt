[Episode 2]

2
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,291
Excuse me. I'm sorry to ask,

3
00:00:29,381 --> 00:00:31,621
but how can I get to the town center?

4
00:00:31,751 --> 00:00:33,421
It's quite the distance.

5
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,281
Walk straight down that road.

6
00:00:37,961 --> 00:00:39,801
-Thank you.
-No problem.

7
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:41,261
Good job today.

8
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,191
-Take care.
-You too.

9
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,541
If only you were given a better owner.

10
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:02,901
Let's get going then.

11
00:01:20,151 --> 00:01:21,080
Here.

12
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:23,191
Go ahead.

13
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:36,121
They're always so fast to leave sets.

14
00:01:39,341 --> 00:01:40,661
-Dae-gwon.
-What?

15
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:45,851
They found out again?

16
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:46,111
[I love how sexy you are
and how you love me.]

17
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:48,711
[Why did you change your number?
You should've at least told me.]

18
00:01:46,241 --> 00:01:48,091
It didn't even last six months.

19
00:01:48,711 --> 00:01:49,941
I'm exhausted.

20
00:01:52,451 --> 00:01:53,641
I'll change your number right away.

21
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:56,321
Let's get going so that
you can rest for the interview tomorrow.

22
00:01:57,071 --> 00:01:58,261
Thanks.

23
00:01:58,341 --> 00:01:59,711
-Hop in.
-Sure.

24
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,621
Don't forget your seat belt.

25
00:02:33,411 --> 00:02:34,511
What on earth?

26
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:43,051
Dae-gwon, what on earth was that?

27
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,701
People did mention something about ghosts.

28
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,021
What ghosts?

29
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:49,951
Check it out for me. Go on.

30
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:51,851
But you're my manager.

31
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:54,881
You! Well, you earn more than I do.

32
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:56,771
Go on.

33
00:03:00,031 --> 00:03:01,751
What is it? What do you see?

34
00:03:02,011 --> 00:03:04,121
Nothing. I don't see a thing.

35
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:05,311
Really?

36
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:17,631
-What? Why?
-Something's there.

37
00:03:21,721 --> 00:03:24,141
-It's her.
-You're making no sense.

38
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:26,650
The kisaeng you slashed to death.

39
00:03:30,871 --> 00:03:32,991
I heard a manager left his actor behind.

40
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:35,451
-Was he hers?
-What do you mean?

41
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,081
One of the managers ran off.

42
00:03:37,521 --> 00:03:39,101
I've seen those fleeing

43
00:03:39,191 --> 00:03:41,351
while leaving their cars behind,

44
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:43,771
but one leaving in the car is a first.

45
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:51,111
Hey, back up.

46
00:03:53,311 --> 00:03:55,211
To give her a ride? No way.

47
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,101
-Why not?
-You know the agency's policy.

48
00:03:57,191 --> 00:03:58,811
-No.
-Come on.

49
00:04:27,721 --> 00:04:28,821
Hello.

50
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:31,811
-Get in.
-Sorry?

51
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:36,651
No, I'm good.

52
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:40,921
The town center is right past that hill.
I'll get there in no time.

53
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:43,031
Which is why you should hop in.

54
00:04:48,141 --> 00:04:50,071
I know well being in the industry myself.

55
00:04:50,161 --> 00:04:52,181
We're not supposed to give people a ride.

56
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:55,401
I don't want to bother you
with something this trivial.

57
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,771
The offer was more than enough.

58
00:04:58,701 --> 00:04:59,801
Good night.

59
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:15,811
You'll catch a cold once your sweat cools.

60
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:19,641
Hold on.

61
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,191
If this is because of earlier,

62
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:24,441
there's no need to be bothered.

63
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:27,471
This is me wanting to walk,
so go about your own way.

64
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:30,071
Copycat.

65
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,421
Wait. He knew?

66
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:41,071
Darn, it's cold.

67
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:47,841
[7 years ago]

68
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:46,881
Do you perhaps know Stevie Wonder?

69
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,441
He sang "I Just Called to Say I Love You"

70
00:05:52,071 --> 00:05:54,271
and is my dad's favorite artist.

71
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:58,931
I once saw him on TV, you know.

72
00:06:00,031 --> 00:06:03,461
Despite being visually impaired,
he writes songs and even sings.

73
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:07,201
On that show, he said this.

74
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:12,001
We were all born with unique talents.

75
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:14,331
The only difference between us

76
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:19,391
"is that some make use of it
while some don't."

77
00:06:23,621 --> 00:06:25,551
And this is what my dad said right after.

78
00:06:26,701 --> 00:06:27,841
Ma-ha,

79
00:06:29,381 --> 00:06:31,891
"I hope you live your life
the way he does."

80
00:06:35,191 --> 00:06:38,221
So you came to our dance team
to utilize your talent?

81
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:42,181
Yes.

82
00:06:43,021 --> 00:06:45,531
I'm thinking about moving to Seoul too.

83
00:06:46,631 --> 00:06:48,391
I doubt he'll approve of that.

84
00:06:57,011 --> 00:06:58,601
You will. Won't you, Dad?

85
00:07:05,851 --> 00:07:07,611
Seoul's too bright even at night

86
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:11,091
to properly see the stars.

87
00:07:13,111 --> 00:07:14,480
That's the only downside.

88
00:07:25,741 --> 00:07:27,021
I can see a lot of stars today.

89
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:40,831
When did you figure it out?

90
00:07:41,411 --> 00:07:42,771
When you started to avoid me.

91
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:45,541
No, I wasn't avoiding you at all.

92
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,081
Only stay at my heel.

93
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:51,881
Got it.

94
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,651
He'll come running over
if he senses that something's up.

95
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,471
Well, we're here.

96
00:08:17,401 --> 00:08:18,591
It's still cold outside.

97
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:31,871
Will you be okay from here?

98
00:08:32,621 --> 00:08:34,341
Yes, I can find my own way now.

99
00:08:39,221 --> 00:08:40,721
A friend will pick me up.

100
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:51,891
We should've just let her get in.

101
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:55,681
She didn't want to
and there's the agency policy.

102
00:08:56,821 --> 00:08:58,981
You know I never go against
the boss' words.

103
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:01,221
As if.

104
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,071
I'm such an idiot.

105
00:09:18,651 --> 00:09:21,151
-Dae-gwon, can you slow down?
-Sure.

106
00:09:42,711 --> 00:09:44,251
What's happening?

107
00:09:47,951 --> 00:09:49,091
Ma-ha!

108
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:52,831
No wonder she refused to get in.

109
00:09:53,841 --> 00:09:54,721
What on earth?

110
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:57,671
-Yu-jin?
-Are you hurt?

111
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,611
No, I'm good.

112
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:01,761
How did you know to get here?

113
00:10:03,261 --> 00:10:05,811
I'm glad. What a relief.

114
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:13,731
Dae-gwon, I'm tired.

115
00:10:14,961 --> 00:10:17,121
-Can we hurry home?
-Sure.

116

[3:04 a.m.]

117
00:10:33,971 --> 00:10:35,561
How did you know to get here though?

118
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:38,991
[Hello? Hey, Yu-jin.]

119
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:41,321
I can't get a hold of Ma-ha.

120
00:10:41,411 --> 00:10:42,951
Maybe she's busy filming.

121
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,441
I can't reach our manager either.

122
00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:46,291
[It just doesn't make any sense.]

123
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:48,671
-Could something be up?
-Let's hang up for now.

124

[I suddenly got a movie shooting.
I'm on my way to Mungyeong.]

128
00:11:29,241 --> 00:11:31,961
Were you that worried about me?

129
00:11:34,031 --> 00:11:35,661
Nothing beats a good friend.

130
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,831
-My soulmate.
-It was quite the distance

131
00:11:39,621 --> 00:11:41,511
and was dangerous to walk alone.

132
00:11:42,441 --> 00:11:43,711
I ran the whole length

133
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:47,321
feeling the cool and refreshing breeze.

134
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,531
The stars kept me company too.

135
00:11:51,851 --> 00:11:55,281
Wasn't there anyone
who offered you a lift?

136
00:11:56,601 --> 00:11:58,141
There was,

137
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:02,591
but it would've only complicated things.

138
00:12:03,861 --> 00:12:06,241
I wouldn't have been as comfortable
as I am with you.

139
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:10,811
Whatever. I still can't believe
what your manager did.

140
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:13,101
How can he leave you stranded?

141
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,131
You should report him.

142
00:12:15,211 --> 00:12:16,931
He shouldn't get away with this.

143
00:12:17,631 --> 00:12:19,701
He'll only do this again to someone else.

144
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:23,271
Forget it. I'm the one
who didn't want to let go.

145
00:12:24,151 --> 00:12:25,771
Besides, he's not a bad person.

146
00:12:27,141 --> 00:12:29,601
I bet he's overwhelmed
with guilt right now.

147
00:12:33,121 --> 00:12:35,851
Wait. But what if you get caught?

148
00:12:38,971 --> 00:12:40,161
It'll be fine.

149
00:12:40,911 --> 00:12:42,801
You should get some sleep.
I bet you're tired.

Hyun-ji, you're here too.

-Okay.

and be safe on the road.

hosting parties and events.

220

I was worried at first
since the genre is foreign to me.

241

the rookie actor I used to be

807
00:54:15,067 --> 00:54:16,207
There's La Ri-ma.

808
00:54:17,357 --> 00:54:20,127
She's prettier in real life.
She's so pretty.

809
00:54:20,217 --> 00:54:21,317
That's La Ri-ma.

810
00:54:32,177 --> 00:54:33,587
Hello.

811
00:54:34,777 --> 00:54:36,667
It's you. My copycat.

812
00:54:38,777 --> 00:54:41,597
What? You don't look anything like me.

813
00:54:43,007 --> 00:54:44,897
Is everyone blind?

814
00:54:45,957 --> 00:54:47,497
La Ri-ma, you're here.

815
00:54:47,577 --> 00:54:48,767
Hey, Director.

816
00:54:49,607 --> 00:54:52,687
-Anyway, is she going to be on the show?
-What?

817
00:54:53,387 --> 00:54:54,797
You wanted her here.

818
00:54:56,207 --> 00:54:57,217
Yes.

819
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:00,917
Well, now that she's here,
we can turn this into a fun episode.

820
00:55:01,877 --> 00:55:03,467
She's my copycat,

821
00:55:03,557 --> 00:55:05,757
and it's her first time
appearing on TV next to me.

822
00:55:07,597 --> 00:55:11,257
Why don't you dress her up
to look exactly like me?

823
00:55:13,017 --> 00:55:14,337
-Hey.
-Yes?

824
00:55:14,417 --> 00:55:15,877
Do you have another outfit?

825
00:55:17,057 --> 00:55:18,027
I do.

826
00:55:18,737 --> 00:55:19,917
Sounds great.

827
00:55:21,157 --> 00:55:23,707
I knew it, La Ri-ma. You're so good on TV.

828
00:55:25,067 --> 00:55:26,257
Is that all right?

829
00:55:27,537 --> 00:55:30,617
You'll have to copy me
to get a few more seconds on TV.

830
00:55:31,847 --> 00:55:32,947
Of course, you'll do it.

831
00:55:34,217 --> 00:55:36,557
What are you doing? We're losing time.
Move it.

832
00:55:36,947 --> 00:55:38,047
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

833
00:55:46,407 --> 00:55:49,837
-Hey, that's Mr. Ji.
-Mr. Ji?

834
00:55:49,977 --> 00:55:52,087
I heard he made
a girl group named Tea Party.

835
00:55:52,177 --> 00:55:53,497
I guess they'll be on the show.

836
00:55:55,827 --> 00:55:57,897
-Ryok... Hyuk, let's go.
-Okay.

837
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:09,377
Once I go on TV like this,

838
00:56:10,297 --> 00:56:12,197
people will criticize me a lot once again.

839
00:56:32,257 --> 00:56:33,757
Hello.

840
00:56:34,717 --> 00:56:36,837
Thank you for your help last time.

841
00:56:37,447 --> 00:56:39,477
I always carried around your jacket

842
00:56:39,557 --> 00:56:41,187
in case I run into you.

843
00:56:41,277 --> 00:56:43,567
Is copying La Ri-ma all you can do?

844
00:56:45,197 --> 00:56:46,207
Sorry?

845
00:57:00,767 --> 00:57:03,887
You'll have to copy me
to get a few more seconds on TV.

846
00:57:07,847 --> 00:57:09,967
Is copying La Ri-ma all you can do?

847
00:57:34,247 --> 00:57:36,057
And this is our last guest.

848
00:57:36,147 --> 00:57:39,797
She's a rookie who came to visit
"Idols on Air" for the first time.

849
00:57:39,887 --> 00:57:44,017
I never imagined that she had a sister.

850
00:57:44,107 --> 00:57:47,277
Here's La Ri-ma's sister, Lee Ma-ha.
Please welcome her!

851
00:57:53,697 --> 00:57:56,957
I'm La Ri-ma's sister, La Ri-maha.

852
00:57:58,667 --> 00:58:00,207
I'll do my best

853
00:58:01,707 --> 00:58:03,427
to copy my sister to a T.

854
00:58:10,597 --> 00:58:12,007
Music, please.

855
00:58:43,157 --> 00:58:44,737
Will you give me a hand?

856
00:58:45,177 --> 00:58:46,807
She reached out for help!

857
00:58:48,827 --> 00:58:50,507
Will she take her hand?

858
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:12,857
[Epilogue]

859
00:59:19,057 --> 00:59:21,037
Hey, she's back.

860
00:59:21,827 --> 00:59:22,927
It has been a month already.

861
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:24,517
And she doesn't live in Seoul either.

862
00:59:25,307 --> 00:59:26,407
She does seem passionate.

863
00:59:45,057 --> 00:59:46,077
Your number.

864
00:59:47,527 --> 00:59:48,537
What?

865
00:59:50,517 --> 00:59:51,577
Okay.

866
01:00:00,947 --> 01:00:02,047
Here.

867
01:00:13,437 --> 01:00:15,637
[You received a video message.]

868
01:00:24,877 --> 01:00:26,777
Copy that by tomorrow,
then I'll think about it.

869
01:00:28,977 --> 01:00:30,077
Thank you.

870
01:01:06,327 --> 01:01:07,387
Copycat.
