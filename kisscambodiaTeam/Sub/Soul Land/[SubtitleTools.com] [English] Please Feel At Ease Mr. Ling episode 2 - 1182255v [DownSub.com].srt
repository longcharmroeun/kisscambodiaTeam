1
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,020
Hello, You You?

2
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,100
Anxin! I have good news! I saw Mike!

3
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,850
He's so much more handsome than in TV!

4
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,460
Then did you take a photo with him?

5
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,650
Of course! I'll be back in a few days.

6
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,750
Can you let me live at your place for a few days?

7
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,590
I don't want to go home, or else my parent's will remind me about marriage again.

8
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,460
No. These few days don't work out.

9
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,240
Why not? Could you have

10
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,250
hidden a man in your home?

11
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:23,570
Its-No, no, the company held a training session and chose me.

12
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:26,920
They want me to go train outside of the city for a few days.

13
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,080
So you can't live here.

14
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,210
I'm scaring you! Alright.

15
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,530
Then I'll play a few more days before coming back! Bye!

16
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,120
Bye...

17
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,270
I noticed you're pretty good at coming up with stories.

18
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:46,950
I can also not make them up.

19
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,890
You move out and make some space.

20
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,110
It's alright.

21
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,970
I think the way you speak nonsense is pretty cute.

22
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,370
Oh, right. Remember to help me buy a wheelchair.

23
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,030
Imported from Germany.

24
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,780
Imported from Germany?

25
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,150
Then isn't that several thousand...

26
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,480
Aren't you about to receive money?

27
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,180
H-How do you know?

28
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,320
You talk about it everyday. "I'm getting paid on Wednesday."

29
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,660
You scared me...

30
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:42,040
Huh? Why does my right eyelid keep twitching?

31
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,420
Grandpa Liu.

32
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:57,090
-Grandpa Liu, your grandson sent you some good food!
-Hey Anxin.

33
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,450
Here.

34
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,100
There's a new one today?

35
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,080
The joy of getting a package is no longer what's in it,

36
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,800
But it's to see what your new manga is about.

37
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,560
-I'm glad you like it. I'm going to leave first.
-Okay. Walk safely!

38
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,200
I'm leaving.

39
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,080
What is the new perfume you're using? It smells really good.

40
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,670
Layered Fragrance. This perfume is not bad.

41
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,000
You can try it too.

42
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,250
Isn't it Gu Anxin?

43
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,750
Anxin? Is it really you?

44
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,370
What a coincidence.
-Gu Anxin, it's been so long since we have last seen each other.

45
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,440
You are still the same.

46
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,810
Nancy, you know her?

47
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,460
Of course. We went to the same school.

48
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,560
Did you guys know, this delivery girl

49
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,000
was the adopted daughter that was abandoned by the Gu family.

50
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,670
Adopted daughter? The one who was kicked out of school?

51
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,670
-Ya!
-Nancy.

52
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,280
Stop talking.

53
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,170
Give me President Wei's namecard.

54
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:00,490
Anxin, this is the business my friend opened.

55
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,070
You can go look for him,

56
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,570
he will give you a good job.

57
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:06,250
No need. The job I have now is pretty good.
-Just take it.

58
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,360
I really don't need it. Thank you.

59
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,300
You are already in dire straits and you are still so arrogant.

60
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,200
She's helping you because she finds you pitiful.

61
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,250
You are really uneducated.

62
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,400
There's really no upbringing at all.

63
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,490
What are you doing?

64
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:31,760
People like me without any upbringing won't know what actions I would take.

65
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,250
Please watch what you say.

66
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,700
I'm leaving.

67
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:41,880
Take this.

68
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,770
Oh yeah, Nancy. About your boyfriend's project

69
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,400
our company won't be investing in it.

70
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,290
This decision is from top management. Please relay this message to him.

71
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,080
Wait, Xin'er.

72
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,440
Gu Xin'er!

73
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,400
How can they do that?

74
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:13,440
You bastard, get out of this family.

75
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,780
Why did you tattletale to Dad?

76
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,200
I- I didn't.

77
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,660
It was you. After you came everything has changed.

78
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,650
It's because of you!

79
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,510
It's because of you, you bastard.

80
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:28,220
It signifies wealth when the left eyelid twitches.

81
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,910
What are you trying to do?

82
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,800
I'm asking you. What are you trying to do?

83
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,550
I'm talking to you.

84
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:09,410
I am the victim, why are you acting like that?

85
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,580
What's wrong with you?

86
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,990
What's wrong with you?

87
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,650
Why are you shaking?

88
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,000
Are you scared of water?

89
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:46,210
Wait here.

90
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,320
♫ Look at me, don't avoid me.  ♫

91
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,380
♫ Give me the last of yourself ♫

92
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:27,340
♫ Let me try to touch your hard shell  ♫

93
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:30,770
Wait here. I'll go close the water.

94
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:35,360
♫ Hug me lightly  ♫

95
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,010
♫ give me the last of yourself  ♫

96
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:43,780
♫ Memories are like heavy rain. Without walking it before  ♫

97
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:47,240
♫ how would you understand ♫

98
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,420
♫ Look at me, don't avoid me.  ♫

99
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:55,500
♫ Give me the last of yourself ♫

100
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,400
♫ Let me try to touch your hard shell  ♫

101
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,800
♫ The fragility of hugging  ♫

102
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:08,110
♫ Hug me lightly ♫

103
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:11,990
♫ give me the last of yourself ♫

104
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:16,840

105
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:22,220
♫ how would you understand ♫

106
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,680
Why are you looking at me?

107
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,860
Nothing.

108
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,160
Your holding the magazine backwards.

109
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,560
Let me calculate this with you.

110
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,280
Based on today, you are responsible for everything.

111
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,790
Maintenance: $490.

112
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,900
Spanner, ¥$30.

113
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,940
Thread seal tape, ¥$10.

114
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,060
Tee pipe, ¥$20.

115
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,610
Faucet: $35

116
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:48,040
Water pipe: $53.23

117
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,880
Pliers: $15

118
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,450
In total it is...

119
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:55,670
$653.23

120
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,630
I understand.

121
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,500
Oh ya, we can clean these things tomorrow.

122
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,880
But you need to help too.

123
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,950
Even if your hurt, you need to help.

124
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,800
What's wrong.

125
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,590
Aren't you cold?

126
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,580
The weather forecast says today is 30 degrees.

127
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:28,880
There's a big difference between indoor and outdoor room temperature.

128
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,640
So weird...

129
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:58,360
You have something here.

130
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,360
Just-let me help.

131
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,060
Do you know how many germs are on a bottlecap?

132
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,000
How many?

133
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,530
1.59 million.

134
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,630
Wow.

135
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:59,760
And it's easy to hurt your teeth resulting in gum infection and enamel buildup.

136
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,440
It does sound pretty scary.

137
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,850
Hurry and eat. We still need to go to the hospital afterwards.

138
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,440
Doctor, are you really sure everything's normal?

139
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,970
Of course it's normal. It's not like he's hurt anywhere else.

140
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,060
Was I too rough?

141
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:33,610
No. Is the doctor married?

142
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:37,380
Doctor Liu? He doesn't even have a girlfriend, so who could he be married to.

143
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,490
Everyone's too busy working in the hospital. No one has time to date.

144
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,710
Sometimes, I'll walk around at home.

145
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,660
What about you?

146
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,310
No.

147
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,330
Then do you have a girlfriend?

148
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,340
Right there.

149
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:52,590
Aren't you brother and sister?

150
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:56,290
Isn't it the trend right now to call each other brother and sister?

151
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,640
I still have something to ask you.

152
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,120
His leg is healing well,

153
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,100
but right now I think his head has some problems.

154
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,980
Just...he often

155
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:18,260
says and does some very odd things.

156
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,670
I don't know what's wrong with him.

157
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,990
The CT scan of his head is perfectly fine.

158
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:26,990
What you're saying must be after the patient is injured, his mental health is impacted as well.

159
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:31,090
The patient's family must slowly make sure he recovers.

160
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,970
Can you keep walking?

161
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:41,910
I'm alright.

162
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,920
Watch out!

163
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,200
So accurate?

164
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,140
Oh my...

165
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,700
You aren't hurt?

166
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,280
How could I be hurt? I've trained before.

167
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,030
Trained?

168
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:06,270
I catch quick delivery.

169
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,560
Wait.

170
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,860
The skin's broken.

171
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,630
What's wrong with that? It's a small problem.

172
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,030
What are you doing?

173
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,450
It doesn't hurt?

174
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,950
It doesn't hurt...it's just a small injury.

175
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:42,920
I-It's a small injury. I'll do it myself.

176
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,610
Alright.

177
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,460
Thank you.

The rain's so heavy. Let's call a car.

Let's keep waiting. Bus 23 will be arriving soon.

It's here! It's here! Let's go, let's go!

I'm sorry. It's 25, but I thought it was 23. So it was 25...

190
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,960
Call a car! I'll pay.

191
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,200
W-Why are you taking off your clothes?

192
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,750
What? You don't need to shower after getting rained on?

193
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:03,430
Y-You shower but you don't need to take your clothes off in front of me. Go inside and take them off.

194
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,090
Oh, right. I forgot to tell you.

195
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:08,090
The showerhead is broken, so you can only use the bath tub.

196
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:11,210
Go and shower first. I'll shower after you shower.

197
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,650
I need you to help me.

198
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,540
Help you do what?

199
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,480
Help me shower.

200
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,660
What are you thinking about?

201
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,230
What am I thinking of?

202
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,800
Or are you expecting something?

203
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,120
W-What's there to expect?

204
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,050
Y-Your foot's hurt, not your hand.

205
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:56,050
You can shower normally before, but you can't today?

206
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,700
But I need to bathe today.

207
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,120
What's the difference?

208
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:05,240
The difference is that I, an injured person, cannot sit into that bathtub.

209
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,940
Figure it out yourself.

210
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:12,060
100 a time.

211
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,410
200.

212

Your good?

213
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,110
Then I'll leave.

214
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,560
Wait.

215
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,250
I can't reach the shampoo.

216
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:57,180
