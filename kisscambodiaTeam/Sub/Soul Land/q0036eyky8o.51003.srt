Send my orders.

33
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,250
Assemble all of the Martial Soul Hall's troops,

34
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,810
and destroy the power

35
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,210
of the Tian Dou royal family.

36
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,650
You really are cruel, Qian Ren Xue.

37
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,510
My suggestion

38
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,750
is for you to go to an extremely dangerous place

39
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,910
where you can quickly improve your skills.

40
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,280
From today onward,

00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,280
Fourth Prince Xue Beng

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,650

of Tian Dou Empire!

has officially begun.

46
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,550

[Episode 157]

48
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,080
We won the fight at the Tian Dou Palace

49
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,610
all thanks to the power

50
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,210
of Tang's clan.

51
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,880
Emperor Xue Ye

52
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,880
also complimented you as well.

53
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,310
Little Freak.

54
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,650
Count me in Tang's clan as well.

55
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,250
Just give me an honorary elder title.

56
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,010
Of course.

57
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,010
Can I stop you?

58
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,050
But

59
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,580
aren't you used to freedom,

60
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,380
and don't want to be in any clan?

61
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,650
Isn't this your clan?

62
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,650
I mean,

63
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,650
are you going to judge me?

64
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,780
I do like freedom.

65
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,380
But that was when I was young.

66
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,580
Now that I'm older,

67
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,410
I'll spend my retirement

68
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,010
in Tang's clan,

69
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,910
as long as you take care
of my food and living space.

70
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,280
Call me when there's a fight

71
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,580
or things get busy.

72
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,180
Old Freak.

73
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,780
Why make it sound so sad?

74
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,780
As long as you're willing,

75
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,210
I will take care of your retirement.

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,310
You want me to train on Haishen Island?

00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,050
Then the Seven Clans
Re-selection Contest...

80
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,050
If I go,

81
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,310
I likely won't be able to participate in it.

82
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,810
Do you think

83
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,810
that with the power we have right now,

84
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,610
we can stop the Martial Soul Hall

85
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,610
from finishing the Contest?

86
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,710
As long as we have the support
of the Tian Dou and Xing Luo Empires,

87
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,080
even the Martial Soul Hall

88
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,080
won't make any risky moves.

89

Choosing

90
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,910
to leave now

91
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,710
to improve your skills

92
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,310
and hone your power

93
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,310
is the best move.

94
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,350

95
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,510

96
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,050
and train on Haishen Island.

97
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,050
You are not the only one
that needs training.

98
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,210
The others in the Shrek Seven Devils

99
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,580
are all at a similar bottleneck.

100
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,710
Also,

101
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,150
if you go together,

102
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,610
you can take care of each other.

103
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,850

104
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,950
How could I not be worried

105
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,010
unless the seven of you

106
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,680
took on this challenge together?

107
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,950
Teacher thought through all of this for me?

108
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,180
Once you return from the Hao Tian tribe,

109
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,880

Qian Dao Liu?

193
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,480
Uncle.

194
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,480
What actually happened?

195
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,610
Your great-grandfather, Tang Chen,

196
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,250
was a level 99 Grand Soul Land Master.

197
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,080
Back then,

198
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,080
he and the Martial Soul Hall's Head Flamen

199
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,080
and also

200
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,080
the Judicial Elder, Qian Dao Liu,

201
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,650
were known as the two leaders
of the soul master world.

202
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,280
[Star Forest]

203
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,750
Your great-grandfather was
a bit more powerful than Qian Dao Liu,

204
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,750
but the gap was very small.

205
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,750
Level 99?

206
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,580
Then who defeated

207
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,880
my great-grandfather and Qian Dao Liu?

208
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,280
Grand Ocean Master from Haishen Island,

209
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,510
Bo Sai Xi.

210
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,310
Her power is equal to Qian Dao Liu's,

211
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,910
but on Haishen Island,

212
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,180
she can harness the power of the ocean

213
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,580
Unless it's someone of level 100 or higher,

214
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,080
no one can defeat her.

215
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,080
A level 100 soul master is just a legend

216
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,080
on the continent.

217
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,680
No wonder Great-grandfather
and Qian Dao Liu failed.

218
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,050
San.

219
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,810
When outsiders set foot on the Haishen Island,

220
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,810
even if they pass the challenge,

221
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,810
they still won't be able to leave.

222
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,380
Have you really decided to go?

223
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,810
Since we're going,

224
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,480
we will definitely pass the challenges

225
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,910
and think of a way to return safely.

226
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,680
Alright.

227
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,850

229

230
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,680
Your father and I didn't expect this.

231
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,380

232
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,380
have acknowledged you,

233
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,580
then

234
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,080
I should pass some of our clan's secret skills

235
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,450
to you.

236
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,310

You Fatty,

245
00:13:10,317 --> 00:13:11,150
get out of my way!

246
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:23,050
You knew I was fast,

247
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,083
but you still blocked me.

248
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,583
Did you do that on purpose?

249
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,017
I was afraid you would get hurt.

250
00:13:35,017 --> 00:13:36,483
If you just rush over,

251
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,217
you might fall into a trap.

252
00:13:39,883 --> 00:13:40,750
Xiang.

253
00:13:41,383 --> 00:13:42,750
Fatty is right.

254
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,483
Brother San's martial soul is focused on control.

255
00:13:45,483 --> 00:13:46,783
Your speed is fast,

256
00:13:46,783 --> 00:13:48,950
but if you get caught
in the Constraint of Spider Web,

257
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,317
you won't be able to escape.

258
00:13:52,683 --> 00:13:53,783
I think he

259
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:55,683
just wanted to show off.

260
00:13:58,183 --> 00:13:59,217

261
00:13:59,217 --> 00:14:00,550

262
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,350

263
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,350
Don't call me Xiang!

264
00:14:06,283 --> 00:14:08,550
Fatty has really met his match this time.

265
00:14:09,217 --> 00:14:10,250
It seems like

266
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,883

to be honest,

273
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,250
I haven't been focused on training at all.

274

286

I'm finally more handsome than you.

287
00:15:02,283 --> 00:15:03,683
But you're still not the most handsome.

288
00:15:03,683 --> 00:15:05,683

289
00:15:05,683 --> 00:15:06,750
