[Soul Land]
[Episode 1]

3
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,910
Nineteen voices were heard when the stone fell in deep streams,

4
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,840
an additional level compared to hell.

5
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,580
So here’s the Devil May Cry.

6
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,590
I don’t know if Tang San is down there

7
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,310
and the stone fell.

8
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,510
What’s the difference?

9
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,890
<i>It’s Shadowless Needle from the Second Elder.</i>

10
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:23,340
<i>Purple Demon Eye! What a talented kid.</i>

11
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,560
<i>This is the Ghostly Trace.</i>

12
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,550
<i>Let’s see how’s he going to dodge this.</i>

13
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,480
<i>Freezy-jade like and invincible, it’s the Xuan Yu Hand.</i>

14
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,790
<i>Did he just block my Pear Blossom Shower
with his bare hands?</i>

15
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:26,790
How dare he! All of you, attack.
Don’t ever let him go!

16
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,700
He’s heading to the Devil May Cry. After him!

17
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,040
Finally, this day has come.

18
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,500
Tang San, that’s enough.

19
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,990
Just give up.

20
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,320
I’m aware that entering inner clan secretly...

21
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,060
and learning its martial arts is unforgivable...

22
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,540
and impermissible.

23
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,550
But I swear...

24
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,400
that I’ve never leaked any of what I’ve learned.

25
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,410
I don’t say this...

26
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,140
to get your forgiveness,

27
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,710
but I wish you all know...

28
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,470
that I never forget my roots.

29
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,690
I didn’t, and I won’t.

30
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,420
Everything I have was given by the Tang Clan.

31
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,410
Be it my life or abilities,

32
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,240
they’re all given by the Tang Clan.

33
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,800
He even made the ultimate hidden weapon of the Tang Clan.

34
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,670
No matter at what time,

35
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:51,140
I’ll always belong to the Tang Clan, even if I’m dead.

36
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,270
I know you don’t allow...

37
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,020
the body of an outer disciple who broke the rules to stay in the clan.

38
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,620
If that so,

39
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,680
let my remains spread over Ba Shu.

40
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,460
He even learnt the greatest inner martial arts in Xuan Tian Records.

41
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,320
I’ll leave naked as I came.

42
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,150
Tang’s Lotus of Buddha’s Rage would be my final present for the clan.

43
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,840
Now, besides my own body,

44
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,760
I won’t bring anything belonged to Tang Clan with me.

45
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,670
The secret books are all in the first block in my room door.

46
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,550
I give everything now

47
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,350
back to Tang Sect.

48
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,900
Wait!

49
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,840
Tang San, why did you have to do this?

50
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:54,560
You’ve given us too many surprises.

51
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,070
Brother, why do you have to be grief over a traitor?

52
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,620
Who said he’s a traitor?

53
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:15,910
Have you seen a traitor who still stayed after learning our greatest power?

54
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:19,790
Have you seen a traitor who would die to prove his sincerity?

55
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:25,900
Have you seen a traitor who had the greatest weapon to kill us...

56
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:31,020
but ended up giving it as a gift to our clan?

57
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,420
Tang San isn’t a traitor,

58
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:42,160
he’s the most excellent genius we ever had for two hundred years.

59
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,990
However, he secretly learnt our...

60
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,360
If you can make the Tang’s Lotus of Buddha’s Rage,

61
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,110
I can close one eye on whatever you steal.

62
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:58,600
You were wrong, so was I.

63
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,110
Just right before this,

64
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:07,580
the chance of the clan’s glory has slipped away in front of us!

65
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,510
Say no more, pass my order!

66
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,640
All members, out you go!

67
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,440
Look for Tang San around Devil May Cry.

68
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,820
I want to see his body unless he’s alive.

69
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,860
From now on,

70
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,610
Tang San will be my inner disciple.

71
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,640
If he’s alive,

72
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:37,660
he’ll be my sole successor of the Chief.

73
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,820
Yes, Chief.

74
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,470
<i>- Taking her away? Over my dead body.
- Let them go.</i>

75
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,960
<i>- I’ll follow you all.
- No!</i>

76
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,980
<i>You may try if you still can stand up.</i>

77
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,860
<i>Don’t cause any more trouble, let’s end this earlier.</i>

78
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,910
<i>Don’t leave me!</i>

79
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:08,490
<i>Seventeen, eighteen, nineteen...</i>

80
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,830
<i>Where’s this?</i>

81
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:20,890
[Soul Land]

82
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,010
<i>I’ve been here after that day...</i>

83
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,290
<i>and become an infant.</i>

84
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,170
<i>I practiced the Xuan Tian Records again but am now in a bottleneck.</i>

85
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,410
<i>This world is called Soul Land.</i>

86
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,270
<i>When everyone grows up,</i>

87
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,510
<i>there’ll be an awaken ability,</i>

88
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,590
<i>called Martial Soul.</i>

89
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,300
<i>Failed again.</i>

90
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,410
<i>I still can’t pass through
the first level of the Xuan Tian Strike.</i>

91
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,230
<i>It has been this for three months.</i>

92
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,260
<i>Why is that so?</i>

93
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,350
<i>Even the Purple Demon Eye which depends on...</i>

94
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,870
<i>Purple Air from East, it’s improving.</i>

95
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,360
<i>Yet, my Xuan Tian Strike hasn’t broken the bottleneck.</i>

96
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,420
<i>Same goes to my Xuan Yu Hand.</i>

97
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,320
<i>When I trained this in my past life,</i>

98
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,460
<i>I never encountered this before.</i>

99
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,570
<i>There’re nine levels for Xuan Tian Strike.</i>

100
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,570
<i>Why is it so troublesome in the first level?</i>

101
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,990
<i>Could it be...</i>

102
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,720
<i>this world is different from the previous one?</i>

103
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,070
It’s time to go back.

104
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,630
Old Man Li, are we going to Nuoding City again?

105
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,900
That’s right.

106
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,120
I have to deliver the order I got yesterday.

107
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,740
I’m so envious of you.

108
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,210
What for?

109
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,150
There are three hundred families in Soul Saint Village.

110
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,410
Which of our grains and vegetables ever had bad sales?

111
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,860
You’re right.

112
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,530
There was even a Soul Saint from our village before this.

113
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,870
Soul Saint?

114
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,770
What does it have to do with the sale of the villagers?

115
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,320
It’s because of the strategic place of Nuoding City...

116
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,290
in between the Tian Dou and Xing Luo Empires.

117
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,670
Traders just come and go all the while.

118
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,930
Or else, to whom should we sell our vegetables to?

119
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,310
You’d better lower down your voice...

120
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,850
in case the village head hears it.

121
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,490
Just let him be.

122
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,110
The Soul Saint incident has happened over 100 years ago,

123
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,540
yet he’s still mumbling it.

124
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,490
The village head is here.

125
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,830
Where?

126
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,790
Hurry up and send them. Stop mumbling every day.

127
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,450
- Yes.
- Yes.

128
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,270
Dad, let’s eat.

129
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,840
Little San, Grandpa is here.

130
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,500
Go, come back before lunchtime.

131
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,600
<i>I’m six years old and going to be awakened today.</i>

132
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,210
<i>They say Martial Soul can be anything,</i>

133
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,600
<i>what would mine be then?</i>

134
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,750
Kids,

135
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,750
this is the handprint left by the Soul Saint in our village.

136
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:48,730
