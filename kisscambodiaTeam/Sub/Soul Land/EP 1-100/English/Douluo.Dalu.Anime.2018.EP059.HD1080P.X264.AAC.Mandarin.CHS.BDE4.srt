[Previous Episode] Tribe Chief,
the hidden weapons are powerful indeed.

20
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,920
We must ask the maker to join our tribe.

21
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,100
Tai Long is here again!

22
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,800
Did his father come too?

23
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,640
Not just his father,

24
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,420
his grandfather is here too!

25
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,580
So strong!

26
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,120
He is at a different level from Zhi Lin.

27
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,740
Is he a Great Soul Land Master?

28
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,460
Is that a soul bone? It’s an attached soul bone!

29
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,840
This kid is indeed awesome. Since it came to this...

34
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,380
<i>No!</i>

This is...

Rong Rong!

Qibao Amber Pagoda,
The Six Supplements!

38
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,880
I thought who is that.

39
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,260
It’s Grand Soul Master Bone and Tribe Chief Ning.

40
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,820
Greetings.

41
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,800
Old Ape, give me some face.

42
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,080
Call off the bet.

43
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,020
Fine. I’ll agree with that.

44
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,660
We’ll call off the bet.

45
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,920
You actually did that?

46
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,460
Old Ape, this is unlike your style.

47
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,720
Old Bone, look at what he’s holding.

48
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,180
This is Hao Tian...

49
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,360
It’s good you know that.
I’m just asking for embarrassment.

50
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,240
You will be the same too.

51
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,480
<i>What a gentle strength.</i>

52
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,640
<i>My damaged body is recovering. Not just that,</i>

53
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,480
<i>with the combination of the
soul pressure and this gentle strength,</i>

54
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,800
<i>the Yangwei Meridian in my
Eight Meridian has been unlocked.</i>

55
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,140
Brother, how do you feel?

56
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,720
I’m fine now.

57
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,380
It’s you?

58
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,180
We meet once again.

59
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,660
Dad, do you two know each other?

60
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,140
Greetings, Tribe Chief Ning.

61
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,660
You can just address me as Uncle.

62
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,920
You’re Tang San? Is your father Tang Hao?

63
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,180
How did you know that?

64
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,020
I’m Tai Tan. Greetings, Young Master.

65
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,450
Young Master? Senior, what are you doing?

66
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,060
Please get up.

67
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,580
My guests, welcome to Shrek School.

68
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,580
I’m the Deputy Dean, Zhao Wu Ji.

69
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,600
Please come in.

70
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,200
It’s you. I’ve been looking for you for a long time.

71
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,280
We can talk about that later.

72
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,140
Find a quiet room for us.
I need to talk to the Young Master.

73
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,600
You have a point.

74
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,500
Everyone, please.

75
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,020
Who asked you guys to come?

76
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,300
Go to your class immediately!

77
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,720
Little San, go and change your clothes first.

78
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,080
After that, come to the meeting room
on the 4th floor.

79
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,780
<i>I’m completely healed
even though I am seriously injured.</i>

80
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,140
<i>Qibao Amber Pagoda is the strongest
Martial Soul of Support Branch indeed.</i>

81
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,560
<i>Senior Tai Tan is really strong.</i>

82
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,020
<i>He’s at least a Great Soul Land Master.</i>

83
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,540
<i>He knows my father. And...</i>

84
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,220
<i>I’m Tai Tan. Greetings, Young Master.</i>

85
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,120
<i>All of my questions will be answered.</i>

86
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,240
I’ve arranged two rooms for both of the tribes.

87
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,700
You can decide which room you want to go first.

88
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,820
Remember to keep calm

89
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,900
no matter what they are going to say.

90
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,360
Thank you, Teacher Zhao.
I know what to do.

91
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,760
I’ve hurt you, Young Master.
Please punish me.

92
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,700
Senior, please get up.

93
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,820
I’m not your young master.

94
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,060
I’m just a normal civilian.

95
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,340
Your father is Tang Hao. He’s my master.

96
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,940
Young Master, you have Hao Tian Hammer.

97
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,060
I’m sure you’re my young master.

98
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,740
What did you say? Hao Tian...

99
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,040
I’m sure I’m not mistaken.

100
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,560
Young Master, you were holding

101
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,600
the unique Martial Soul that belongs
to the Hao Tian Tribe,

102
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,640
Hao Tian Hammer.

103
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,080
This is Hao Tian Hammer?

104
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:36,159
<i>Come.</i>

105
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,119
<i>Unleash the other Martial soul that you have.</i>

106
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,480
<i>You’re Tang San? Your surname is Tang?</i>

107
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,420
<i>Don’t show this to anyone else.</i>

108
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,340
<i>So, Master knew about this a long time ago.</i>

109
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,740
<i>Why did he ask me to hide it?</i>

110
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,620
Senior, can you tell me

111
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,500
who exactly is my father?

112
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,460
Did my master tell you nothing?

113
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,360
Young Master, can you tell me
your experiences with my master?

114
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,120
If my master didn’t say anything,
I wouldn’t dare to tell you.

115
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,060
My father and I lived
in the Soul Saint Village.

116
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,300
He was the only blacksmith in the village.

117
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,840
Besides working,

118
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,540
he only likes to drink.

119
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,620
A blacksmith?

120
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,400
Master, what happened to you?

121
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,080
In the past, you were the...

122
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,000
Senior, do you recognize these words?

123
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:35,860
[Soul Land]

124
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,460
When I was six,

125
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,760
my father left this letter for me
and he never came back.

126
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,240
<i>Little San,</i>

127
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,080
<i>I would have been gone already
if you’re reading this letter.</i>

128
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,680
<i>Don’t come and find me. I’m useless.</i>

129
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,060
<i>You’re growing up.</i>

130
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,380
<i>I need to take back the things
that belonged to me.</i>

131
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:04,400
Yes. These words are my master’s.

132
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,560
<i>One day, we’ll be reunited.</i>

133
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,560
<i>I hope you grow strong.</i>

134
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,920
<i>But I hope you won’t grow strong too.</i>

135
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,040
<i>You must choose your own path.</i>

136
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,360
<i>If one day, you think to be a soul master is not good,</i>

137
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,420
<i>you can return to Soul Saint Village.</i>

138
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,740
<i>And be a blacksmith like me.</i>

139
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,700
<i>Don’t miss me.</i>

140
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,640
<i>Tang Hao.</i>

141
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,440
Master.

142
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,420
How can you say you’re useless?

143
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:51,480
In my heart, you’re an honorable man.

144
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,820
Is my father really from Hao Tian Tribe?

145
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,900
Why did we end up living in that village then?

146
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,820
What exactly happened?

147
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,780
Please tell me!

148
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,660
Young Master, I’m unsure about
what happened to Master.

149
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,000
You only need to know

150
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,080
Master is an honorable man.

151
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,620
He’s the greatest man alive.

152
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,240
That’s all you should know.

153
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,200
The Li Tribe,

154
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,140
we were under the Hao Tian Tribe once.

155
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,890
We left the tribe because of Master.

156
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,940
We created our own tribe in Tian Dou City.

157
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:40,200
Now that you’ve appeared,
the Li Tribe will be under your command.

158
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,840
We have 217 soul masters in the tribe.

159
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,700
We’ll die for you.

160
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,200
We’ll die willingly for you, Young Master!

161
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,360
Senior, you’re Tai Long’s grandfather.

162
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,040
I’m his classmate.

163
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,000
I’m younger than him.

164
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,460
If you don’t mind,

165
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,980
I’ll address you as Grandpa Tai.

166
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,060
But...

167
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,960
Grandpa Tai, please don’t reject me.

168
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,720
I’ll meet Tribe Chief Ning right now.

169
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,540
Farewell.

170
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,460
Please keep my background a secret.

171
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,160
Young Master,
please be wary of Ning Feng Zhi.

172
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,400
Master once said that

173
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,340
Ning Feng Zhi is an ambitious man.

174
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,300
Grandpa Tai, don’t worry. I know what to do.

175
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,720
Hello, Uncle Ning. Sorry for the wait.

176
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,680
It’s nothing.

177
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,720
Have a seat.

178
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,920
Can I address you as Little San?

179
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,980
Of course. You’re Rong Rong’s father.

180
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,180
I heard about you from Rong Rong.

181
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,400
You impressed me
when we met at the auction house.

182
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,280
I didn’t expect you to be my friend’s son.

183
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,460
You know my father?

184
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,820
He’s the youngest Grand Soul Land Master
in Soul Land.

185
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,220
I believe almost all the people in this world

186
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,080
have heard of him.

187
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,980
Grand Soul Land Master?

188
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,460
He has been missing for many years.
I wonder where he is?

189
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,500
I don’t know about his whereabouts either.

190
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,860
He disappeared eight years ago.

191
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,060
Senior Tai Tan said my father
is from the Hao Tian Tribe.

192
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,740
He may be with the Hao Tian Tribe now.

193
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,960
No. That’s impossible.

194
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,960
Why?

195
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,960
I don’t know the reasons
and I can’t tell you why either.

196
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,860
Only your father has the right to tell you.

197
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,620
Little San, I came here today
because I wanted you to join our tribe.

198
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,260
But since you’re the son of my friend,
that’s impossible.

199
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,240
However,

200
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,180
I’m interested in your hidden weapons.

201
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:13,500
Are you willing to sell the method
of making the hidden weapons?

202
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,940
You can give me a price.

203
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,820
Impossible.

204
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,320
I won’t sell the methods to you.

205
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,740
But I promised Rong Rong that

206
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,940
I’ll sell the hidden weapons to her tribe.

207
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,020
You can be in charge of the process.

208
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,800
But the final step of assembling

209
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,760
must be completed by me.

210
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,660
Oh? But why?

211
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:38,360
Firstly, I spent a long time figuring them out.
I don’t want to sell it.

212
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,460
Secondly,

213
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,820
I need a few years at least
to teach the blacksmiths

214
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,920
how to make them.

215
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,120
But I need to train. I don’t have much time.

216
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,820
You have a point.

217
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,520
Uncle Ning, which hidden weapons
are you interested in?

218
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,780
We’ve seen Rong Rong’s hidden weapons.

219
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,220
I want a set just like hers.

220
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,200
I want 500 sets. I’ll give you
10,000 gold soul coins for each set.

221
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,180
What do you think?

222
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,460
The price is fine. But I need to say this first.

223
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,800
For the set of hidden weapons,

224
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,580
it does not include the
Flying Godly Claws on Rong Rong’s hand.

225
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,440
I can change it into Soundless Arrow.

226
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,440
Because the Flying Godly Claws
is not a hidden weapon.

227
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,680
And it’s made from prime materials.
It’s hard to make one.

228
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,980
<i>Flying Godly Claws?
Rong Rong didn’t show it to us.</i>

229
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,040
<i>It looks like he knows how to
make more weapons.</i>

230
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,580
Okay. Besides that, I’ll give you
one million gold soul coins.

231
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,340
As a sign of gratitude for
giving Rong Rong the Silk Woven Tulip.

232
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,100
Do you still have that plant?

233
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,920
I’ll buy it with a huge sum if you have it.

234
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,360
The Silk Woven Tulip is a rare grass.

235
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,860
It’s hard to find one.

236
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,120
That is a gift,

237
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,180
so I don’t need any rewards.

238
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:11,540
These are the blueprints of Soundless
Arrow, Shoe Crossbow, and Hidden Knife.

239
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,700
Let me say this first.
I’m only in charge of the final steps.

240
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,380
Regarding the initial steps,

241
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,640
Uncle Ning, please think of something.

242
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,620
I heard that your tribe has your own blacksmiths.

243
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,880
I don’t think this is hard for you.

244
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,280
Kid, you’re a good businessman.

245
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,380
You don’t even need to make the parts yourself.

246
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,400
Isn’t it too easy to gain 50,000 gold soul coins?

247
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,060
Uncle Bone.

248
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,940
[Next Episode]

249
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,900
Are you saying that my father
came to see me before?

250
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,360
Uncle Bone, please don’t say that again.

251
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,080
If we continue to let him grow,

252
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,380
he’ll be a threat to us.

253
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,920
What are you guys doing?

254
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,780
Are you saying that
my father would hurt Brother San?

255
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,060
No. I need to clarify things with Oscar.

256
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,860
We only have one goal.

257
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,440
Since you want to be a soul master,

258
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,100
you mustn’t stop.

259
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,080
Why did you think I wouldn’t come back?

260
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,720
Do you guys want to ask me something?
