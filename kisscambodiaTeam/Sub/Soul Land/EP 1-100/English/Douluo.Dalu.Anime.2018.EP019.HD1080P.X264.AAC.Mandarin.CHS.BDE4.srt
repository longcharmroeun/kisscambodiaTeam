What’s a Soul Arena?

That’s a place where soul masters

I want all of you to at least get silver soul badge.

This isn’t the place you should come.

41
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,630
Go home!

42
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,160
This muscle man seems tough,

00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,730

55
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,330
Xiao Wu’s soul skills are indeed ineffective
towards strength type soul masters,

56
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,500
but only when their soul power
is higher than her.

57
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,900
Others are just a piece of cake for her.

Tang San is being passive.

101
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,030
Such a waste.

102
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,860
<i>The real motive of the cage is not to limit her,</i>

103
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,630
<i>but to attack from the sky.</i>

104
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,260
The Controlling is effective
against Keen Attack.

105
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,930

Don’t worry, I didn’t cast the poisonous spikes.

112
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,900
Your soul power decreased sharply...

113
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,660
because my first soul ring...

114
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,230
carries paralysis effect.

115
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,730
Tang San won.

Assassinations, investigations
and ambushes are your strengths.

122

If you were in
a more complicated demographic,

123
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,360

It seems San Woo looks promising.

Let the battle begin!

What a great strike!
Can the San Woo take it?

149
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,860
<i>What a great impact.</i>

150

<i>Blue Silver Plant got shattered.</i>

151

<i>His hammering looks similar to
my Skill of Random Hammering.</i>

<i>Even though its rhythm isn’t organized</i>

153
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,660
<i>and not fierce enough,</i>

154
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:42,460
<i>but its speed is way faster.</i>

155
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,460
What a strange move.

156
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,630
Too bad he’s slow.

157
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,130
What a strong kick.

158
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,390

My second soul ring, Haunted Vine...

162
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,260
is a terrifying Plant Branch.

163
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,690
It’ll scatter fine seeds during attack...

164
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,490
which parasite on your body.

165
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,230
As long as it has enough power,

166
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,660
the seeds will grow.

167
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,090
It’ll produce a nerve poison that numbs you.

168
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,130
Its spikes are the deadliest.

169
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,590
Once you are spiked, it’ll turn into a pus.

170
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:51,260
<i>In order to help Little San get this
600-year-old Haunted Vine,</i>

171
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,530
<i>we even involved the Dean of Nuoding School.</i>

172
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,030
<i>It seems to be working well.</i>

173
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,560

Second soul skill.

175
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,930
Stake all on this throw!

176
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,990
What a powerful attack! Can the San Woo take this?

177
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,990
It even has tracking ability.

178
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,660
That’s bad.

179
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,790
You two, how dare you!

180
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,230
No, Xiao Wu.

181
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,530
Little San, what are you doing?

182
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,590
They did what they should.

183
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:53,790
My injury isn’t severe.

184
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,660
Her sleeve arrow might kill you.

185
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,030
Now that you’re being totally trapped
by Blue Silver Plant,

186
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,960
and your soul powers are much depleted
after using the skill just now.

187
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,490
The numbing poison has further gone
into your bodies.

188
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:11,060
There’s no way you can escape her attack.

189
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,660
I think we’ve already won the round.

190
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,290
Thank you for saving our lives.

191
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,860
We admit defeat.

192
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,960
San Woo wins!

193
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,390
<i>Luckily, I have Tang Clan weapons.</i>

194
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,830
<i>I underestimated the enemy.</i>

195
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,230
Where’s the Dean?

196
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,930
He has some issues with the shop.

197
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,560
Let’s head back.

198
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,030
You all may leave first.

199
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,060
I have something to do too.

200
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,630
Take things easy.

201
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:27,790
Boss Dai,

202
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,160
are you not going?

203
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:33,630
No.

204
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,460
Come on, let’s go together.

205
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,640
Didn’t you say that women are just resources?

206
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,480
What resources?

207
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,750
It’s nothing.

208
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,570
Get lost.

209
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:46,940
My taste isn’t as bad as yours.

210
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,140
Dirty.

211
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:01,670
Disgusting.

212
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:02,710
You!

213
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:04,870
Stand there!

214
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,510
They...

215
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:26,970
Is it still hurt?

216
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,670
It’s because of me.

217
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:30,910
It’s nothing,

218
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,540
I’m not that weak.

219
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:33,840
Let’s go.

220
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,040
Hurry up,

221
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,640
or else we’ll lose them.

222
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,630
[Next Episode]

223
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,400
Your task today...

224
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,930
is to eat special made sausages by Oscar,

225
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,400
at least one piece.

226
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,870
They’re from the Cang Hui School, right?

227
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,270
Fight?

228
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,870
I love it!
