Is Sister Huo Wu here?

26
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,960
I’m here to apologize.

27
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,800
Get into the cart.

28
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,900
There are so many crows in this lousy place.

29
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,780
Why isn’t there anything else?

30
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,340
Everyone, keep quiet. Something is happening.

31
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,300
Enemy attack!

You guys go and deal with him.

38
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,200
Handle these children to me.

39

00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,360
Senior shall be alright, right?

41
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,000
Looking at his skill,

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,480
he must have almost recovered.

43
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,280
It shouldn’t be a problem to deal with
about 10 men in black.

44
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,120
However, our side...

45
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,380
You guys have some abilities at a young age.

46
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,560
Unfortunately, you’re going to
lose your lives today.

<i>The oppression he gave me</i>

53
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,340

Okay.

58
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,480
Firstly, let’s use Human Meteor Hammer Formation

59
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,500
to break his defense.

60
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,240

You can attack me, but you can’t damage my scales!

00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,740
<i>He must have shown his defense soul skill.</i>

87

<i>But there’s no effect.</i>

88
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,200

This is Lovesick Heartbroken Scarlet.

113
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,320
You actually got the recognition
from Lovesick Heartbroken Scarlet.

Why?

119
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:43,320
Why isn’t me the one who gets
the Lovesick Heartbroken Scarlet?

120
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,780
If I got the Lovesick
Heartbroken Scarlet,

121
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:04,020
I could also reach that level.

122

<i>Brother. For you, even if I couldn’t be a human...</i>

131
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,880
No.

132
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,400
It’s really celestial.

133
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,600
Okay. I shouldn’t have
offended your nobility.

134
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,580
<i>He really didn’t discover my identity.</i>

135
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:26,700
<i>Did the Lovesick Heartbroken Scarlet
cover my identity?</i>

136
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,160
<i>To keep maintaining at the martial soul form</i>

137
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,420
<i>would deplete our soul power very fast.
We must end this soon.</i>

138

Fourth soul skill, White Tiger Meteor Strike!

139
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,300
Wait a moment!

140
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,820

141
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,700
Boss Dai!

142
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,400
I am alright.

143
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,860
<i>There are seven kinds of heat
flowing in my body.</i>

144
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,020
<i>They’re urging my soul power.</i>

145
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,440
<i>It not only doesn’t cause any discomfort,</i>

146
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,800
<i>I even feel that my soul power
is growing dramatically.</i>

147
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,680
<i>What is actually happening?</i>

148
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:01,420
Rare Powerful Chrysanthemum?
It’s really Rare Powerful Chrysanthemum.

149
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,640
You’ve eaten this celestial flower before.

150
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,280
<i>He knows about Rare Powerful Chrysanthemum.</i>

151
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,760
This is...

152
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,840
Have you eaten anything like this?

153
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,340
Yes.

154
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,720
That’s right.

155
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,800
No wonder there’s such a golden light on you.

156
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,460
Lordiaara. You cannot hurt this kid either.

157
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:46,100
He has a fate with me.

158
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,500
Kid. Are you willing to take me as your teacher?

159
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,920
With your talent,

160
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,200
plus you’ve eaten Rare Powerful Chrysanthemum,

161
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,760
your future achievement will be
as good as mine.

162
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,360
<i>I knew that this master
has a weird personality.</i>

163
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,200
<i>But he wanted to accept disciple
under this situation.</i>

164
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,580
<i>Teaching from the Grand Soul Land Master
is very tempting to any soul masters.</i>

165
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,160
<i>He can also save his life.</i>

166
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,320
<i>How would the kid reject?</i>

167
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,780
I can take you as my teacher.
But I have conditions.

168
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,560
Okay.

169
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,900
She is my fiancée.

170
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,840
She’s also my partner for
the Martial Soul Fusion Skill.

171
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,220
You cannot hurt her.

172
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,100
Martial Soul Fusion Skill.

173
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,860
Great. I promise.

174
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,480
We are the closest friends.

175
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,500
We’ve always cooperated well.
You cannot hurt them either.

176
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,800
Master! They are the aim of our mission!

177
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,120
I can’t decide when it comes to
the aim of our mission.

178
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:48,660
But I can promise you
to kill only one person. All right?

179
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,700
Who is it? How dare you intrude
The Sacred Temple!

180
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,220
Pope token?

181
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,220
Greeting to the Elder.

182
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,140
Lead me to the Pope.

183
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,520
[Next Episode]
If any one of us is injured,

184
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,720
you will be my enemy.

185
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,900
Ju Hua Guan!

186
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,340
Do you think there’s no one else in Shrek School?

187
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:26,080
What’s so great by bullying the kids?

188
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,060
You should have understood.
With just a few of you,

189
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,320
you can’t beat me.

190
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,480
Yu Xiao Gang.

191
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,380
Even if I tell you the secret
of Twin Martial Souls now,

192
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,080
your disciple won’t have a chance
to know about it.

193
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,740
Is this your revenge on me?

194
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,340
Your target should be me.

195
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,120
Let them go and
I’ll let you punish as you wish.
