Little San, what is your fourth soul skill?

24
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,760
Show us.

25
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,600
This is my fourth soul skill.

26
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,440
These are your substitute members.

27
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,490
As long as you win every round,
none of these will matter.

28
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:35,720
Only three of you will battle
in the preliminary rounds.

29
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,980
Pull yourselves together.

30
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,580
We are here to be the champion!

31
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,660
Even losers want to be a champion?

32
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,270
I will show you who is the real losers here!

[Soul Land]
[Episode 68]

34
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,240
Aren’t them from the Cang Hui School?

35
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,000
Why are they picking a fight on us?

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,300
What do you think you’re doing?

37
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,400
The mutts’ master is here.

38
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,010
Let’s go.

39
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,980
They became the good boys,
when their master is here.

40
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,060
All right, Fatty.

41
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,160
That old man taught in Cang Hui School?

42
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,660
Teacher, do you know that old man?

43
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:45,000
His name is Shi Nian, soul master
of Nightmare and a hateful man.

44
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,810
Nightmare? He uses illusions?
How is that Martial Soul ever possible?

45
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,830
His Martial Soul is pestering.

46
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,650
Even much stronger warriors wouldn’t
choose to pick a fight with him.

47
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,840
It’s starting, let’s go.

48
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,520
Chief Ning, any thought
on the competition this year?

49
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,120
I know a team,

50
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,520
they might win this competition for the empire.

51
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,980
Hello, ladies and gentlemen!

52
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,480
I am your host from the Suo Tuo Soul Arena!

53
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:17,600
It’s a great honour to be your host
for the opening ceremony this year!

54
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,470
First of all, let’s welcome the 28 teams
of the competition this year!

55
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:26,240
The first to arrive is the Tian Dou Imperial School Second Team!

56
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,820
They are also the embodiment
of strength for the Tian Dou Empire!

57
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,630
Their motto for this year

58
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:36,390
is to “Stop at nothing and go for everything.”

59
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,420
I believe all the audiences are
feeling confident for their performance.

60
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:52,340
Victory for Tian Dou! The unbeatable Tian Dou!

61
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,170
Tian Dou Imperial School is actually so popular?

62
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,320
Let’s hope we won’t go up against them.

63
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,750
Why?

64
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,920
We are strong.

65
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,160
If we beat them to a pulp,

66
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,970
the audiences will drown us
with their loathing and spits.

67
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,140
That makes sense.

68
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,820
Up next, we have the Five Elements Schools!

69
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,230
They are one of the best team we are
hoping to see become the champion!

70
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,520
Which of the teams

71
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,470
will come up on top of the preliminary?

72
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,640
This is so exciting!

73
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,920
Right after them is the School of Florals!

74
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:43,280
The last team that is wearing
an odd uniform is the Shrek School!

75
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,280
They registered motto is

76
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,130
“Unrivalled Champions”!

77
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:52,450
Perhaps they want to leave a mark
in history with a novel display!

78
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,350
We look forward to their performance!

79
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,800
She...

80
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,210
Why would anyone wear such a hideous uniform?

81
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,480
They even have a product placement on it.

82
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,980
Are they sponsored by stinky tofu or something?

83
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,570
Boss, we will shut their traps with our strength.

84
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,150
Look at the three over on the first row.

85
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,730
Where? I don’t see anything there.

86
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:55,220
They are so far away. Of course, you can’t see a thing.

87
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,200
Up there.

88
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,150
You know those people?

89
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:03,200
My father is on the right.
You met him before, Brother San.

90
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,240
On his left is the Emperor of
Tian Dou Empire.

91
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,680
Emperor Xue Ye.

92
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,960
<i>So he is Emperor Xue Ye?</i>

93
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,810
On His Majesty’s left is the Chief of
Martial Soul Temple of Tian Dou.

94
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:18,760
He is one of the four
Platinum Chiefs, Chief Salas.

95
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,780
He is not a good man.

96
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,480
His Majesty of Tian Dou Empire

97
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,520
will officiate the competition!

98
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:14,070
I, Emperor Xue Ye of Tian Dou Empire,
on behalf of my empire,

99
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:20,340
and on behalf of the organizer
of this competition, announce that

100
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:25,600
Continental Soul Master School
Elite Tournament

101
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,600
now begins!

102
00:09:51,290 --> 00:10:00,540
[Soul Land]

103
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,120
At this moment,

104
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,780
I hope that all soul masters taking part
in this event

105
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,220
will display their full strengths

106
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,360
and acquire great achievements.

107
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,590
You are all bringing glory to the Tian Dou Empire.

108
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:46,340
Let’s welcome the Chief
of Qibao Amber Tribe to give his speech!

109
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,150
I am honored to be the special
guest for the opening ceremony.

110
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,600
I’ve seen far too many
rise and fall of soul masters.

111
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,150
Only experience and training will help you grow.

112
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,800
Just as His Majesty said,

113
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,260
you shall bring glory to the Empire.

114
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,830
And tomorrow, the Empire will be proud of you all.

115
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,880
Chief Ning, as the most powerful
Supporting Branch soul master,

116
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,040
are you putting your expectation on any team?

117
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:20,530
I do expect one team to become the champion.

118
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,380
Which of the team will get Chief Ning’s approval?

119
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,390
I shall keep it a secret for the time being.

120
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,500
But the victory shall belong to
the Empire nonetheless!

121
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:48,260
Sadly, we couldn’t find out which
team has the favor of Chief Ning.

122
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:49,920
Up next,

123
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,610
let’s welcome the notary for our competition.

124
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,520
Platinum Chief of Martial Soul Temple,
Chief Salas!

125
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:01,600
Everyone, the exciting battles will soon begin!

126
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,040
Which team are you going to give this flower to?

127
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,330
Tian Dou Imperial School, of course.

128
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,490
They are the pride of Tian Dou Empire.

129
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,880
Grandmaster, why do all the audiences get a blue flower?

130
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,230
This is the most common flower
found in Tian Dou Empire,

131
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,990
but it represents the true
and deep love we have.

132
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,790
People present the flowers to
the schools they support.

133
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,940
As for how you present it, you’ll find out soon.

134
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,620
Welcome to Tian Dou Soul Arena!

135
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,700
Lord Salas will draw the lot
for the first preliminary round.

136
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,540
Round one,

137
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,280
Cang Hui School versus Zi Xing School!

138
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,570
Round two,

139
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:06,080
Auckland School versus Fiery Light School!

140
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:12,160
Shrek School versus

141
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,600
Tian Dou Imperial School!

142
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,640
Shrek School?

143
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,450
The team with the funky uniform.

144
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,850
Tian Dou Team is hit with good luck this time.

145
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,370
Is this rigged?

146
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,700
No way this is luck.

147
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,460
This can’t be a coincidence.

148
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,160
Tian Dou Imperial School Second Team.

149
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,500
They are the second team,

150
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,570
but they are from
Tian Dou Imperial School after all.

151
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:44,290
I doubt they are weak in any way.

152
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,440
Master.

153
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,490
Since you have the confidence,

154
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,600
I will give you another challenge.

155
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,240
Secure victory within one minute.

156
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,750
One minute? Impossible!

157
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,500
Brother San, let me do it.

158
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,550
No, we follow the original plan.

159
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,450
We can’t show your true strength yet.

160
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,370
Fine.

161
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,840
Junior, don’t worry about it.

162
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,840
Without further a due,

163
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,380
Continental Soul Master School
Elite Tournament

164
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,290
will begin its first-round battle!

165
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,360
Both teams, please get on the stage.

166
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,550
Rong Rong, the flower!

167
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,100
Look! It’s Brother San.

168
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,930
They are here.

169
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,860
What school is that?

170
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,520
Someone is actually cheering for them.

171
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,350
- Shrek School, fighting!
- I have no idea.

172
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,660
Maybe they are nothing more than vermin.

173
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,150
Great! Fighting!

174
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:46,120
Up next is the main show for tonight.

175
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,120
the team we’ve all been waiting for,
Tian Dou Imperial School Second Team!

176
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:59,090
Old Man Bai, this is more
grandeur than in previous years.

177
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,420
Why do they get to go on stage and show off?

178
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,550
Why can’t our school get the same privilege?

179
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:08,470
It’s better. We don’t have to show our trump card.

180
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,800
But that means

181
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,040
our revenue from advertisements will lose!

182
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,140
Shrek School, fighting!

183
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,990
Shrek Seven Devils, go for it!

184
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,800
They are clearly using us as sidekicks,

185
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,720
so their good boys get to stand out more.

186
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,550
Wait, there are only six members.

187
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,920
Soul of Tian Dou Empire,
glory throughout the land!

188
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,600
The Imperial School will steal the show!

189
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,330
Little San, you are in charge of planning.

190
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,700
Members that will go on are

191
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:55,220
Mu Bai, Xiao Wu, Jing Ling, Huang Yuan,
Jiang Zhu, Tai Long, and me.

192
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,200
We will proceed with plan A.

193
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,790
We must defeat them within one minute.

194
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,690
Yes, one minute.

195
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,610
[Next Episode]
Hello, kids from Shrek School.

196
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,810
If I could marry your daughter,

197
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,080
I will join the Qibao Amber Tribe now.

198
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,530
If she is willing to do so, I have no objection.

199
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,480
I admire the prowess of Qibao Amber Tribe.

200
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,960
Do I have the honour to join your cause?

201
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,440
Bronze Ring Confine!

202
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,400
They are killing people!

203
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,540
You fell for it.

204
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,660
This match is rigged!
