Stop!

21
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,460
You’re going back to Shrek School with me.

22
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,180
You won’t need many herbs.

23
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,480
This old freak is willing to come to our school?

24
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,220
This is unbelievable!

25
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,720
With a Grand Soul Land Master here,

26
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,140
it’s a good thing for our school too.

27
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,480
Master, I want to see them.

28
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,840
You just came back,
don’t you want to rest?

29
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,760
I’m not tired.

30
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,100
I brought some gifts for them.

31
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,740
What did you say?

32
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,220
Your soul power has reached Level 37?

33
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,140
I swear. I’ll never leave you

34
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,500

[Soul Land]
[Episode 53]

36
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,900
Little San, you’re finally back.

37
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,320
If you take longer, Xiao Wu will be worried.

38
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,140
I’ve been away for a long time,
I’ve made you worry.

39
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,260
Brother San, where are the gifts?

40
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,760
Hurry and show us.

41
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,460
I’ve brought Boss Dai this
Rare Powerful Chrysanthemum.

42
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,720
Eight Petal Fairy Orchid is for Little Ao.

43
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,000
Cockscomb Phoenix Flower is for Fatty.

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,220
Rong Rong, yours is Silk Woven Tulip.

45
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,060
You’re giving them the herbs
that you got from Dugu Bo.

46
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,840
For your ability,

47
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,020
you don’t need a shortcut like this.

48
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,380
Don’t worry, Master.

49
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,540
I’ve picked these premium herbs
according to their characteristics.

50
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,680
Mainly to solidify their body
and remove impurities.

51
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,820
It won’t do them any harm.

52
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,960
Okay, I believe that
you know what you’re doing.

53
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,800
Little San,

54
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,480
although Dugu Bo is in favor of you

55
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,020
he’s willing to be our school’s adviser,

56
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:25,360
we still have to stay vigilant as he’s weird.

57
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,540
Brother, Grandmaster,

58
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,100
are you saying that Dugu Bo has come to our school?

59
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,840
Master, Xiao Wu, and all, don’t worry.

60
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,880
Dugu is a nice senior.

61
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,840
Besides, he has promised me

62
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,000
that he won’t hurt anyone from Shrek School.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,480
You can rest assured.

64
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,180
Zhu Qing, this ultimate premium herb for you.

65
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,000
It can raise the dead, grow flesh from
bones and seize the world’s fortune.

66
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,480
However, to consume this premium herb,

67
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,020
you need to pay a price.

68
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,140
I hope that you’ll be prepared for this.

69
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,140
I understand, thank you, Brother San.

70
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,620
This herb is named as
Lovesick Heartbroken Scarlet.

71
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,760
There’s a lovely yet sorrowful story about it.

72
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,760
Once upon a time, there was a young man.

73
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,060
He was placid and he loved to
care for the flowers and trees.

74
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,460
His garden was full of green lotus,
which was a beautiful sight.

75
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,960
He sang to the flowers
and drank with the moon.

76
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,700
If he saw a flower withered,
he would mourn for it.

77
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,740
He would collect the petals,
bury and mourn for them.

78
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,340
It is said that
emotions touch Heaven and earth.

79
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,560
His love for flowers
touched the Flower Fairy.

80
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,560
She descended to earth and married him.

81
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,980
But their good time don’t last long.

82
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,020
God knew about this and was furious.

83
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,860
As fairy and human can’t be together,

84
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,760
he ordered Flower Fairy back to Heaven.

85
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,400
Since the young man lost his wife,

86
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,580
he was in deep sorrow and
didn’t take care of the flowers.

87
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,880
Thus the walls and fences
fell apart and the flowers withered.

88
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,740
It was a miserable sight in the garden.

89
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,720
One day, an old man came.

90
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,260
He told the man that his favorite
white peony in the garden

91
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,900
was the incarnation of his wife.

92
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:38,560
If he ruined the flower,
Flower Fairy would lose her fairy form

93
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,520
and descended to earth again to be his wife.

94
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,160
But he must not give up caring for his garden.

95
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,360
After saying those,
the old man disappeared into thin air.

96
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,180
The young man woke up.

97
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,780
He regretted his actions,
so he cared for the flowers again.

98
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,200
Yet, although he loved his wife,

99
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,740
he can’t afford to ruin the peony.

100
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,660
So he cared for it more than usual,
and cried to the flower day and night.

101
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,540
Lovesick and heartbroken took away his life.

102
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:10,400
When he died, he bled on the petals.

103
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,820
The blood stained on the petals

104
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,320
is the young man’s heart blood.

105
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,660
<i>Lovesick and heartbroken,
two parallels never meet.</i>

106
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,760
This flower is extraordinary,
and it chooses its owner.

107
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,440
When you pluck it,
you must think of your loved one.

108
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,620
Drop a drop of blood on the petal.

109
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,420
If you change your mind,

110
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,580
even if you bleed to death,
you can never pluck the flower away.

111
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,560
The stone under the flower
is the Dark Absolute. If you ruin it,

112
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,780
this Lovesick Heartbroken Scarlet
will lose its healing ability as well.

113
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,780
After plucking the flower,
as long as it stays with its owner,

114
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,380
it will never wither.

115
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,640
But I...

116
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:11,280
Zhu Qing, although I know little
about your affairs with Boss Dai,

117
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,120
among the seven of us,

118
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,840
you are the only couple.

119
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,620
That’s why I bring this to you.

120
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,800
I hope that you can be the fateful one.

121
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,640
<i>Let’s go together. Didn’t you say...</i>

122
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,700
I’m sorry, Brother San.

123
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,120
I’m not single-minded.
I have no fate with this flower.

124
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,080
Zhu Qing, there’s no need to say sorry.

125
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,420
Master, you’re in love with Auntie Er Long,

126
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,240
maybe you can try this.

127
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,680
What can it bring to me even if I eat it?

128
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,400
If there’s a fate, I’ll keep it with me forever.

129
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:59,460
[Soul Land]

130
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,220
<i>Er Long, my wife,</i>

131
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,140
<i>is my second uncle’s illegitimate daughter,</i>

132
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:31,000
<i>which means she is my cousin.</i>

133
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,940
Seems like I still can’t let it go.

134
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,020
<i>Xiao Wu hasn’t moved her gaze away from Brother San.</i>

135
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:16,800
<i>That gaze is focused, true and pure.</i>

136
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,550
Xiao Wu!

137
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,740
<i>I can’t believe that I’m the fated one.</i>

138
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,020
<i>Brother, I’ve finally understood.</i>

139
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,660
Brother, that legend must be true, right?

140
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,980
I don’t know either.

141
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,220
Xiao Wu, eat it then.

142
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,800
It will help you.

143
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,620
No, Grandmaster is right.
This premium herb,

144
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,100
how can I bear to eat it?

145
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,360
Didn’t you say that

146
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,340
after it chooses its owner,
it will never wither?

147
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:56,720
I want it to accompany me,
I’ll care for it with my love.

148
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,380
But...

149
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,180
Brother, don’t worry, I’ll work hard.

150
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,360
I’ll keep improving.

151
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,620
Then you shall protect it.

152
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,060
It will protect you as well.

153
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,940
<i>Should I leave him?</i>

154
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,540
<i>If I don’t,</i>

155
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,560
<i>I’m afraid that the Grand Soul Land Master
with him will harm me.</i>

156
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,440
<i>No, I can’t leave.</i>

157
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,780
<i>I’ve sworn that I won’t leave him.</i>

158
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,580
<i>Only with him,</i>

159
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,140
<i>I can feel the happiness
that Mom has mentioned.</i>

160
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:41,820
Great, this is awesome.

161
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:46,640
Five levels, my soul power
has increased by five levels!

162
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,480
Why are you so excited?
It’s just five levels.

163
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,760
I’ve increased by six levels.

164
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,960
This premium herb is so wonderful.

165
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,620
Why should we work hard then?

166
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,140
We should just eat this every day.

167
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,660
Stop daydreaming.

168
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,640
Little San has said previously,
everything has their limits.

169
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,660
Herbs are harmful if we overeat it.

170
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,000
I’m just saying.

171
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,500
Rong Rong, look.

172
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,460
One, two, three, four.

173
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,860
Your Qibao Amber Pagoda has nine levels now!

174
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,880
It has turned into Jiubao Amber Pagoda.

175
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,800
Is it that Silk Woven Tulip

176
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,000
is the secret key to
breaking the limits of my tribe?

177
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,300
You’ve all done absorbing?

178
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,320
Brother San.

179
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,840
Brother San, thank you so much.

180
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,020
I have no idea how I can repay you.

181
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:22,030
Brother San, my Qibao Amber Pagoda
has turned into Jiubao Amber Pagoda.

182
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,630
That means I’m no longer restricted by
my tribe’s inherited constraints.

183
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,360
You’re welcome, we’re teammates.

184
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,040
<i>Did he notice anything?</i>

185
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,480
Brother San, what is this skill?

186
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,720
Why did I lose my sight just now?

187
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,680
Rong Rong, are you okay?

188
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,080
I’m sorry, I didn’t control my vision power just now.

189
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,600
This is my Purple Demon Eye.

190
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
All thanks to the Eager Gaze Dew,

191
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,000
I’ve grown to the Surreal level.

192
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
<i>In Tang Clan, Surreal level
Purple Demon Eye only exists in legends.</i>

193
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,720
<i>Out of my surprise,
it can see through all disguise.</i>

194
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,500
<i>Xiao Wu...</i>

195
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,300
Brother, congratulations.

196
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,720
If you eat this Lovesick Heartbroken Scarlet,

197
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,180
you’ll improve better than us.

198
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,960
No, I can’t bear to.

199
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,680
I want to keep it with me forever.

200
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,900
[Next Episode]
I’ll entrust Xiao Wu to you.

201
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,700
You’re leaving?

202
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,680
About my ability, we’ll see on the ring.

203
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,280
If there’s another round, I’ll hit him hard.

204
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,380
I’m afraid that you don’t have the chance.

205
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,900
You’re new here, don’t you know
about our advance class’s rules?

206
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,160
Rules? People like them,

207
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,340
how can they be a Grand Soul Land Master?

208
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,380
The enemy who wants to take
your lives away will not show any mercy.

209
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,380
Be careful, everyone.
