Your father and I

20
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,700
want to create a supreme being with

21
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,700
Decade Millennium Rings.

22
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,500
After the contest,

23
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,240
you guys can graduate from school.

24
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,500
Graduate?

25
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,360
That’s the real test.

26
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,380

Emergency! Everyone, be careful!

29
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,000
You make me angry!

30
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,660
Here’s a suitable beast.

31
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,600
Little San, this soul beast is 4,000 years old at least.

32
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,460
How dare you interrupt me!
I’ll kill you!

33
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,740
This is the King of the Land, Bloodthrist.

34
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,380
Its element is fire.

35
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,760
It’s around 4,000 years old.

36
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,880
It’s suitable for us.

37
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,960
Seventh soul skill, Dragon Form!

38
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,180
It’s just a Millennium Soul Beast.

39
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,380
Teacher Er Long needn’t release
her seventh soul skill at all.

40
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,960
And she’s the one fighting now.

41
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,320
Master, Teacher Er Long, she...

42
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,980
<i>God, why are you punishing me like this?</i>

43
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,760
<i>Why?</i>

44
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,300
Xiao Gang, you are here,

45
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,860
but I still feel distant from you.

46
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,980
Er Long.

47
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,420
Is it that hard being together with me?

48
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,900
Er Long, let go of me first.

49
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,240
This is one of its strongest technique,

50
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,480
Lava Strike!

51
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,860
The scariest part is the flickering aura
before its attack.

52
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,820
It can confuse its enemies.

53
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,780
The next moment,

54
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,920
it’ll unleash a heat ray that’s
as hot as lava to kill its enemies.

55
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,900
She’s undamaged?

56
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,340
Be careful of the tail!

57
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,480
How dare you interrupt me?

58
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,240
I will make you regret your actions!

59
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,140
Poor creature.

60
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,260
Squat! Everyone, squat!

61
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,120
I’m the Evil Phoenix...

62
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,660
I always thought Tigress is the fiercest being.

63
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,380
Now, I know that the female dragon
is the fiercest being.

64
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,600
Dai Mu Bai, who are you
referring to as the tigress?

65
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,380
Of course Zhu Qing...

66
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,880
No! Zhu Qing! I’m not talking about you!

67
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,480
I can explain myself!

68
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,320
I’ve decided!

69
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,040
So black!

70
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,240
From now on, Teacher Er Long will be my idol!

71
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,640
<i>My goddess has returned!</i>

72
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,920
Fatty, it’s yours.

73
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,780
It’s mine?

74
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,340
Your element is fire too. It’s suitable for you.

75
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,039
Frander, I can’t believe this.

76
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,499
I didn’t believe you when you say
your sister has a bad temper.

77
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,799
But, I think you’re right.

78
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,659
I’ve decided. I’ll keep watch next.

79
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:43,419
I will stand guard. No objections.

80
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,840
Fatty is absorbing the soul rings.

81
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,240
As a teacher, I need to guard him.

82
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,440
Xiao Gang, go to sleep now.

83
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,800
Wu Ji and I will stay here.

84
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,540
Teacher Er Long is my idol.

85
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,520
No wonder she’s known as the
Killing Point of the Golden Iron Triangle.

86
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,280
I think you guys don’t need
to keep watch anymore.

87
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,260
Let’s go to sleep.

88
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,640
I’ll skip that. I don’t want to
squeeze with you guys.

89
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,260
I’ll stay outside and accompany the teachers.

90
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,220
Fine.

91
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:09,370
[Soul Land]

92
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,380
Dean Frander, is Fatty not finished yet?

93
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,580
He finished absorbing the soul rings.
I wanted him to continue his training.

94
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,140
Looks like he acquired a great skill
for his fourth soul ring.

95
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,380
Who’s playing with fireworks
so early in the morning?

96
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,200
Fatty!

97
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,700
Everyone, prepare yourself.
We will move out after breakfast.

98
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,040
Fatty and I have acquired our fourth soul ring.

99
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,700
Did you guys think about your next soul ring yet?

100
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,040
But the soul ring that Fatty absorbed yesterday,

101
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,180
Grandmaster said that is the best soul ring for him.

102
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,980
Fatty, how do you feel now?
How’s your fourth soul ring?

103
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,520
It’s easy. I absorbed it within half an hour.

104
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,780
This is strange.

105
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,280
Was the King of the Land

106
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,580
giving up its life because of Teacher Er Long?

107
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,340
And it thought I can end it suffering?

108
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,020
So it allowed me to absorb that quickly?

109
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,520
That is possible.

110
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,880
Master did some research on this.
There are two scenarios where

111
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,560
it’s the best for soul masters to
absorb soul beasts after their death.

112
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,640
First, the soul beast must be filled with grudges.

113
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,940
Second, the soul beast must die willingly.

114
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,960
Not only can you absorb
their soul ring completely,

115
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,200
their age will not restrict us
from absorbing them.

116
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,180
And they will most probably drop a soul bone.

117
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,080
Even if we’re only at Level 40,

118
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,260
if a Decade Millennium Soul Beast
is willing to let us kill it,

119
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,620
won’t we suffer any backlashes?

120
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,880
Is that great?

121
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,720
Not at all. Do you think it’s easy?

122
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,100
Do you think they would die for you,

123
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,780
and give you their soul rings?

124
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,400
That is the ideal scenario.

125
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,240
It’s quite impossible.

126
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,460
<i>Nothing is impossible.</i>

127
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,740
<i>Under the right circumstances,</i>

128
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,840
<i>miracles will happen.</i>

129
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,200
So,

130
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,000
that means I did not fulfill

131
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,860
both of the conditions then.

132
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,800
If the King of the Land was killed by Teacher Er Long,

133
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,760
it would be the first scenario.

134
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,420
It’s hard to fulfill the other scenario too.

135
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,740
If you want a soul beast
to have grudges against you,

136
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,560
you need to hunt them yourself.

137
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,880
You can’t ask others to hunt them for you.

138
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,060
It’ll split up their grudges.

139
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,500
But normally,

140
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,480
soul beasts that a soul master wants to hunt

141
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,660
are usually stronger than the soul master.

142
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,140
It’s hard for us to beat them flawlessly.

143
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,700
No wonder it’s hard to find a soul bone.

144
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,820
These conditions are too extreme.

145
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,780
By the way, Fatty, what’s your fourth soul skill?

146
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,340
I’ll show it to you when I have the chance.

147
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,000
I think it’s great.

148
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,800
But the area of effect is small.

149
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,020
And I can’t lock my target
before unleashing the skill.

150
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,180
I made these Cure Pills myself.

151
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,860
Miasmas are poisonous.

152
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,460
You will be safe from the miasma
if you consume them.

153
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,100
It’ll boost your energy too.

154
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,600
Everyone, be careful.
Our vision is obscured.

155
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,760
Stay closer to each other.

156
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,880
Go to the back. Let’s swap.

157
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,520
The mist is poisonous!

158
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,540
This is not miasma.
Little Ao, Detoxifying Small Sausage!

159
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,340
Everyone, stay in this field.

160
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,380
I’m using the Fragrant Silk Woven Flower.

161
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,480
Any poison

162
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,340
is useless in its field.

163
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,820
Everyone, stay in this field for now.

164
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,160
Be careful! The soul beast is coming!

165
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,340
I think it created the thick mist.

166
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,760
We’re surrounded.

167
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,260
Little San, can you see the soul beast from here?

168
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,120
I’ll try. Purple Demon Eye.

169
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,140
Master, it’s the Pink Lady.

170
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,200
There are more than a thousand of them.

171
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,080
What? More than a thousand?
How is that possible?

172
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,580
What’s a Pink Lady?

173
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,520
Pink Lady is a scorpion-like soul beast.

174
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,400
They stay together in groups.
They rarely attack humans.

175
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
Because their bodies are
pinkish and transparent,

176
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,740
they are known as Pink Lady.

177
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,160
A group of Pink Lady consists
of around 100 of them.

178
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,619
The strongest one leads the group.

179
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,539
Pink Madam is the mutation of Pink Lady.

180
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,540
It has consumed at least 100 men.

181
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:27,680
I’m sure there’s a Pink Madam in this group.

182
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,800
Pink Madam?

183
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,520
[Next Episode]
Why are they so hostile towards us?

184
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,780
Er Long! Come back!

185
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:50,400
Frander, do you see the Fatty’s weaknesses now?

186
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,900
Brother San, assist me!

187
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,120
Oscar, hurry!

188
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,440
When are you going to allow

189
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,860
Little San to train his second Martial Soul?

190
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,300
You want to see her?

191
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,880
Aren’t you afraid Er Long would get angry?

192
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,280
Actually, I have an idea.

193
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,660
But it’s quite risky.

194
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,040
Everyone, be careful.

195
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,440
It’s coming.
