Retreat.

25
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,520
These kids are taught by
the Wisdom Vertex, Master.

26
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,360
Master!

27
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,360
Forget about Shen Feng School. Set up the fort!

28
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,500
Boss Dai, defense quickly!

29
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,220
Great! It’s now!

30
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,220
The fourth soul skill, Blue Silver Cage.

31
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,380
Pay attention, everyone!

[Episode 73]

36
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,520
Oscar, Pink Sausage.

37
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,960
Li!

38
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,160
While everyone was focusing on
White Tiger of Netherworld,

39
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,760
the Pink Sausage was released.

40
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,980
Little San chose the right timing to do so.

41
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,080
What a great move!

42
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,980
Tribe chief, you’re absolutely right!

43
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,320
In team battles, a soul master
of Controlling Branch...

44
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,200
did bring a powerful impact.

45
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,340
Strengths can be weaknesses as well.

46
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,540
Fortunately, Huyan Li is safe...

47
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,140
even though his arms were fractured.
He’s just fainted over due to the pain.

48
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,800
Then it’s good.

49
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,060
Don’t you worry, Chief Huyan.

50
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,580
Elephant Armored School
still left four members.

51
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,560
The game might have its turn around.

52
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,940
Let’s continue watching.

53
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

54
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,960
Brother!

55
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,860
They broke the cage.

56
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,060
Start the countdown!
Five, four, three, two,

57
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,440
Now, I announce the result of
Preliminary second round, first match.

58
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,280
Shrek School versus Elephant Armored School.

59
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,220
Shrek School won.

60
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,660
Little San has a well-planned tactic.

61
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,880
He clearly knew that...

62
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,540
Huyan Li is the captain of
Elephant Armored Team...

63
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,640
as well as the core of the team.

64
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,800
This is the opponent’s most powerful strength,

65
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,680
and also the utmost important part.

66
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,380
Once Huyan Li is entangled,

67
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,960
the opponent’s perfect defensive formation...

68
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,900
would be ruined immediately.

69
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,720
We’ll meet very soon.

70
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,960
Sure, you’re welcomed at any time.

71
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,020
Xiao Wu, please give me a hand.

72
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,600
Jiubao Boosts! Third, Soul!

73
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,940
Shrek School! The winner!

74
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,320
<i>Rong Rong said,
to grasp Heart Separation Control,</i>

75
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,760
<i>one should have a strong observing
ability of the overall condition.</i>

76
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,180
<i>At the meantime of flying knives
hit the fallen leaves,</i>

77
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,960
<i>release Blue Silver Plant
to entangle these three stakes.</i>

78
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,960
<i>The introductory practice...</i>

79
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,000
<i>is to hit precisely
on different targets simultaneously.</i>

80
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,520
<i>It requires multi-tasking
as well as aiming precisely.</i>

81
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,100
<i>This is really hard.</i>

82
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,300
<i>It requires a very high mental strength...</i>

83
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,360
<i>and also excellent response.</i>

84
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,020
What? Can’t grasp the feeling yet?

85
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,040
Master.

86
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,820
In order to grasp Heart Separation Control,

87
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,480
you need perception rather than controlling it.

88
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,540
Perception?

89
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,200
Right. Relax yourself.

90
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,040
Think of what did Rong Rong
and I told you yesterday.

91
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,100
Provide corresponding assistance precisely...

92
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,000
to the targets that
require different auxiliary effects.

93
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,420
This can further maximize
the auxiliary ability of...

94
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,900
Qibao Amber Pagoda.

95
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,080
Little San, feel the changes
in surroundings with your heart.

96
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,220
The martial soul can
strengthen your attributes,

97
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,820
including your perception.

98
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:39,300
Three Aperture Governing Heart.
Ventilated Nine Deficiency.

99
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,940
<i>It’s no good.</i>

100
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,060
<i>Martial soul at each level will initiate,
while using Heart Separation Control.</i>

101
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,960
<i>It means that I’ve to distract
my mental power to control soul beasts.</i>

102
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,680
<i>It also means to initiate
and control simultaneously.</i>

103
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,180
<i>It will require a more powerful
mental power to control than the usual.</i>

104
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,500
<i>If not, I’ll be attacked by
the soul power itself.</i>

105
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:47,120
Little San...

106
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:15,500
[Soul Land]

107
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,060
<i>Perception is in prior to controlling.</i>

108
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,080
<i>Each Blue Silver Plant seems to be
the extension of my mental power.</i>

109
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,960
<i>By the feedback of Blue Silver Plant,</i>

110
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,460
<i>I can control the overall condition accurately.</i>

111
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,740
<i>So that I can adjust my
soul power and mental power precisely.</i>

112
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,160
<i>The ultimate practice of
Heart Separation Control...</i>

113
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,040
<i>is to grasp every change
of the surroundings.</i>

114
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,460
<i>Other than observing it,</i>

115
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:44,260
<i>I will have to bring it under my control as well.</i>

116
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,200
<i>Little San seems to be fully
integrated into the surroundings.</i>

117
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,940
<i>Is this so called the top
mimicry environment of cultivation?</i>

118
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,500
<i>But this can only be done by...</i>

119
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,040
<i>those at Level 70 and above, isn’t it?</i>

120
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,000
<i>Little San is only at Level 41.</i>

121
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,360
<i>Have his spirit power developed
to such a high level?</i>

122
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,500
Brother San, finally you wake up.
You scared us.

123
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,860
Little San, what did happen just now?

124
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,880
Tell me in detail.

125
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,060
I think I have quite a big breakthrough.

126
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,280
According to you,

127
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,680
these Blue Silver Plants are familiar to you,

128
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,580
without showing any rejection.

129
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:28,060
I’ve met a few soul masters of Plant Branch.

130
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,080
But no one can attract the same plants as you do.

131
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,300
You seem able to control them...

132
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,420
by your own martial soul.

133
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,880
I’m sure that it’s beneficial and harmless to me.

134
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,300
But I couldn’t say why either.

135
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,800
Since there’s no harm,
why do you insist on finding the reason?

136
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,880
Brother San, you’re a freak
in the eyes of others.

137
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,280
A bit more freakishness doesn’t matter.

138
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,240
Anyway,

139
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,200
how’s your progress of
Heart Separation Control?

140
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,260
Do you need me to guide you in further?

141
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,420
You’ve achieved...

142
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,980
such a great outcome by just one day!

143
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,760
I admit that I was slacking off before.

144
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,820
Brother San, do you know?

145
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,040
Sometimes, I really feel like
dissecting your brain...

146
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,480
and take a look at the inside.

147
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,000
By your side,

148
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,260
none of us deserves to be a freak.

149
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,040
Fine, Rong Rong. You have to keep it up as well.

150
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,080
I wish that you’ll be succeeded to cultivate...

151
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,380
Four-Aperture Fortitude before the final match.

152
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,460
So, the real power of
Jiubao Amber Pagoda can be exerted.

153
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:52,040
Little San also.
Keep up with your practice too.

154
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,220
Yes.

155
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,200
The first six rounds of Preliminary are over.

156
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,900
Other than Elephant Armored School,

157
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,860
why there are no more decent opponents?

158
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,720
All my sausages are useless now.

159
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,040
Since you’re keen to battle,

160
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,480
I’ll find an opportunity for you in the future.

161
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,200
But it’s not today.

162
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,780
Why?

163
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,740
Your opponents of today,
Othello School has abstained.

164
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,460
It seems that your fame has been well spread.

165
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:15,560
Shrek School...

166
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,140
All of you are well-known now.

167
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,240
Yet, being your Dean,
this will never be enough for me.

168
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,460
You know it well, right?

169
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,800
Don’t get defeated by the others.

170
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,800
Dean is right.

171
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,100
We shouldn’t take it lightly!

172
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,520
Coincidentally,

173
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,260
Lei Ting School will be the team
in the central arena of today’s battle.

174
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,520
This team is a powerful opponent that
all of you have to be extra careful.

175
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,200
Let’s go and watch the battle.

176
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,840
Shrek School!

177
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:12,260
Shrek School!

178
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,580
I love all of you very much!

179
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,940
Xiao Wu! Tang San!
